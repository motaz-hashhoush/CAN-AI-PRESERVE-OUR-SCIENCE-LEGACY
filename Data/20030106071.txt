b"\xe2\x80\x98ORBITAL SPACE PLANE (OSP) PROGRAM\nAT LOCKHEED MARTIN\nRobert Ford\nOSP Program Manager\nLockheed Martin Space Systems\nHuntsville, Alabama, U.S.A.\nrobert.ford@lmco.com\nABSTRACT-B\nLockheed Martin has been an active participant in\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Launch Initiative (SLI) programs over\nthe past several years. SLI, part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Integrated\nSpace Transportation Plan (ISTP), was restructured in\nNovember 2002 to focus the overall theme of safer,\nmore affordable space transportation along two pathsthe Orbital Space Plane (OSP) and the Next Generation\nLaunch Technology programs. The Orbital Space Plane\nprogram has the goal of providing rescue capability\nfrom the International Space Station by 2008 or earlier\nand transfer capability for crew (and contingency cargo)\nby 2012. The Next Generation Launch Technology\nprogram is combining research and development efforts\nfrom the 2\xe2\x80\x9dd Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle\n(2GRLV) program with cutting-edge, advanced space\ntransportation programs (previously designated 31d\nGeneration) into one program aimed at enabling safe,\nreliable, cost-effective reusable launch systems by the\nmiddle of the next decade. Lockheed Martin is one of\nthree prime contractors working to bring Orbital Space\nPlane system concepts to a system design level of\nmaturity by December 2003. This paper and\npresentation will update the aerospace community on\nthe progress of the OSP program, from an industry\nperspective, and provide insights into Lockheed\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s role in enabling the vision of a safer, more\naffordable means of taking people to and from space.\nOVERVIEW-B\nThe Orbital Space Plane program is part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nrevamped Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP).\nIt calls for an early crew rescue capability OSP\nlaunched on an expendable launch vehicle (ELV) by\n2008 or earlier and a fill crew transfer OSP by 2012.\nNASA updated these dates in July 2003 from the\noriginal requirements of 2010 for rescue and 2012 for\ntransfer in recognition (reinforced by the Columbia\naccident) of the urgent need to provide a safer means of\n\ntransportation to and from ISS for our astronaut corps.\nThe Lockheed Martin system will meet NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nrequirements to transport a crew of four astronauts, be\nless expensive and more flexible to operate than Shuttle,\nand most importantly, provide higher levels of safety\nwhen compared to Shuttle and Soyuz. Industry is\ncompetitively developing conceptual designs of the\nOSP system that best balance customer needs as\nreflected in the high-level requirements. A major shift in\nemphasis, driven by the earlier need date for the OSP,\nhas occurred in that NASA desires little or no advanced\ntechnology should be included in the critical path of an\nOSP system, while the earlier 2GRLV program\nincluded funding of significant technology advancement\nprojects. High-level requirements (referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cLevel\n1\xe2\x80\x9d) were published by NASA Headquarters in February\n2003 as a means to provide system concept guidelines\nto the OSP program. Some of the key needs expressed\nin these requirements included:\nThe OSP system design shall provide a crew\ntransfer capability toifrom ISS as soon as practical\nbut no later than 2012.\nThe OSP system shall provide the capability for\ncrew rescue from ISS as soon as practical but no\nlater than 2010.\nThe OSP system shall provide the capability of\ntransporting contingence cargo to and from ISS by\nreplacing some or all crewmembers with\ncargoflogistics equipment.\nThe OSP system shall be designed for minimum\nlife-cycle costs.\nThe OSP system shall be operated through at least\nthe year 2020.\nProbability of loss of crew and vehicle for a rescue\nmission shall be better than S o y .\nProbability of loss of crew and vehicle during a\ntransfer mission shall be better than Shuttle.\nThe OSP system shall meet all applicable ISS\nrequirements for visiting and attached vehicles.\n\n1\n\nThis work is unclassified and publicly available. It was performed\nunder Contract No. NAS8-01098 as part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Orbital Space Plane\nProgram.

Figure 1 shows the elements of the OSP\noperational system.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nSTATUS-B\nNASA awarded three study contracts in April 2003\ntotaling $135 million: $45 million each to Lockheed\nMartin, Boeing, and the Northrop GrummadOrbital\nSciences team. They were asked to assist in the\nrequirements refinement process that will result in a\nsystem requirements review (SRR) and associated\nsystems requirements document. Originally planned for\nOctober-November 2003, a technical directive was\nprovided to all three prime contractors that moved the\nSRR to September 2003. The contractors are still\nperforming system trades and analyses to refine their\nconcepts to be ready for a system design review (SDR)\n(now slated for December 2003 due to the accelerated\nplan). There is reason to believe that NASA plans a\ncomDetitive downselect to a single contractor for the\n\n0\n\nThe Pad Abort Demonstration program will\ndevelop the fundamental capability to test crew\nescape technologies in a pad abort situation.\nLockheed Martin is the prime contractor.\nThe X-37 program is to validate thermal effects\nduring approach and landing and autonomous\napproach technology. Boeing is the prime\ncontractor.\nThe Demonstration of Autonomous Rendezvous\nTechnology (DART) program is to develop and\ndemonstrate autonomous rendezvous and proximity\noperations and is being worked by Orbital Sciences\nCorporation.\n\nCommercial expendable U.S. launch systems would\nclearly benefit from the opportunity to launch the OSP\nwhile providing alternate access to space. Figure 2\nshows candidate launch systems for the Lockheed\nMartin OSP. Early crew rescue capability is critical to\nrealizing full science capability of the ISS.\n\nFigure 1 OSP Operations Concept\n\n* A I M member grade, job title.\n\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAtlas V\nDelta IV\nStandard HLV\nStructure\n\nl r\n\n432\n\n542\n\nHLV\n\nAtlas Single-Body Nomenclature xyz\nx = PLF Size (4 or 5 m) *\ny = Number of Solids (0-5)\nz = Number of Centaur Engines (1,2)\n\nfigure 2 Baseline LV Configurations\nSince the Space Shuttle Columbia accident in February\n2003, there has been increasing pressure on NASA to\naccelerate plans for providing a complementary vehicle\nto the Shuttle to ensure access to the ISS. As a result,\nNASA has released plans to accelerate the OSP\nschedule. In parallel, Lockheed Martin assessed the\nimpact of meeting a schedule for an OSP initial\noperating capability (IOC) by 2008 or earlier, and while\nchallenging, believes it can be accomplished.\nOSP ACCELERATION CHALLENGES-B\n\nLockheed Martin has determined that a combined OSP\ncrew rescuehansfer capability is possible even earlier\nthan 2008. This determination is based on some critical\nassumptions and commitments by both Lockheed\nMartin and NASA. Under Lockheed Martin's current\ncontract with NASA to develop OSP design concepts,\nan SDR is scheduled to take place in December 2003.\nThe work necessary to accomplish a preliminary design\nreview (PDR) and a critical design review (CDR) must\nbe well understood. Our assessment of the accelerated\nprogram results in shortened time periods between key\nprogram milestones.\n\n*AIAA member grade, job title.\n\nAlthough aggressive, we believe this schedule is\nachievable and will yield a safe, low-risk technical\nsolution, assuming certain critical steps are taken.\nOur accelerated schedule reduces the period of time\nbetween CDR and IOC compared to NASA's original\nbaseline schedule. To successfully meet the compressed\nschedule while still maintaining a low-risk approach,\nLockheed Martin emphasis is to choose to develop a\nsingle rescueltransfer vehicle design rather than\nevolving a rescue design to a transfer design. This\nwould eliminate one demonstration program to qualify\nproduction hardware. Development flight tests could be\nused to reduce flight risks while providing valuable\nlaunch operations experience, reducing site integration\ntime before the qualification flight by as much as 5\nmonths.\nAnother time-consuming activity on the critical path to\nIOC is the software design, development, and test\nprogram, Since software integrates the h c t i o n s of all\nother subsystems, software development is highly\ndependent on fill understanding of the hnctional\ncharacteristics of the subsystems. Early fimding to\nmature the subsystem designs could reduce the software\ndevelopment schedule by 8 months.\n\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nNASA Level 1&2\nRequirements\n\nFigure 3 Requirements Development Process\nOne of the biggest challenges for both Lockheed Martin\nand NASA will be determining and implementing a\nmanagement approach that meets the critical need for\ngovernment insighvoversight while at the same time\nexecuting the program in a more commercial-like\nmanner. Lockheed Martin will use experience gained in\nrecent programs in the space and aeronautic sectors,\nwhich it has fielded systems to, and reduced schedules\nto meet the nation's need. An efficient, innovative,\ncollaborative management approach (Figure 3)\nillustrates the flow of requirement development that\nhelps focus on the system's approach, when combined\nwith a determined and unwavering technical focus on a\nsimple, safe, low-risk solution, provides the best\nopportunity for an OSP by 2008 to become a reality.\n\nseries of trade studies to optimize key technical and\nprogrammatic elements considered to be of greatest\nvalue to NASA. The primary criteria that were\nconsidered in the trade studies were safety,\naffordability, risk, and evolvability to mission\ncapabilities beyond ISS support. Configurations that\nwere assessed as part of the trade studies included a\nwinged vehicle (e.g., Shuttle and X-37), a lifting body\n(e.g., X-38 and HL-20), and a pure capsule (e.g., Apollo\nand Soyuz). Figure 4 shows the concepts under study.\n\nLOCKHEED MARTIN AND OSP-B\n\nLockheed Martin Space Systems Company is\ncommitted to being a preferred provider of human and\nreusable space transportation systems and services. We\nhave a long heritage-more\nthan 45 years-of\nproviding space transportation services, including the\nMercury, Gemini, Space Shuttle, and ISS human space\nflight programs.\nUnder the current SLI contract to develop a design\nconcept for the OSP, Lockheed Martin has conducted a\n* A M member grade, job title.\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nOSP 202 Airplane\n\n- Fully Reusable Airplane Configuration\nOSP 302\n\n- Small Reusable Airplane/Service Module\nConfiguration\n\nOSP 402\n\n- Capsule/Service Module Configuration\n- Max Reusable CapsuIe/min Expendable\nService Module\n\n-\n\nOSP 502\n\n- Capsule/Service Module Configuration\n- Min Reusable Capsule/max Expendable\nService Module\n\nX-38\n\n- Maintain Size to Take Advantage of\nParafoil, Aero Work and V201\n\nHL-20\nFigure 4 Concept Trade Study\nA winged vehicle and a lifting body vehicle have\nseveral disadvantages: they include wheels and wheel\nwell doors requiring fragile thermal barrierskeals\nduring reentry; they are considerably heavier than\ncapsule-like systems; they do not easily incorporate a\ncrew escape system; and they may not provide the\nevolvability into vehicles capable of carrying out\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s missions of exploration (Moon, Mars, L1, L2,\netc).\nA pure capsule is inherently more robust, and therefore,\nsafer, in the three critical areas of flight control, thermal\nprotection, and structures. But a pure capsule has the\ndisadvantages of excessive g\xe2\x80\x99s during a launch abort\n(NASA has a 14-g limit spec) and, for the space station\ninclination of 51.6\xe2\x80\x99, the risk of an abort that would\nresult in a landing in the Alps.\nSome concepts look at landing under parachutesrobust and reliable and negating the need for wheel well\ndoors in the thermal shield.\nUnder any circumstance, NASA would prefer the new\nOSP to be capable of launching on both the Atlas V and\nthe Delta IV, and eventually a next generation Reusable\nLaunch Vehicle (RLV). Winged vehicles and lifting\n\n*AIAA member grade, job title.\n\nbodies do not provide the kind of evolvability that can\nsignificantly help to meet NASA\xe2\x80\x99s needs beyond ISS.\n\nISSUES-B\nThe final report of the Columbia Accident Investigation\nBoard (CAIB) is due to be released by the end of\nAugust and its findings will have an important impact\non the Orbital Space Plane program. It is anticipated\nthat in addition to the need to correct technical issues\n(such as foam insulation falling from the external tank),\nthere will be strong recommendations to revamp NASA\nmanagement processes and/or culture. It will be critical\nfor the Lockheed Martin and the NASA OSP team to\nensure recommendations from the CAIB are fully\nimplemented while maintaining a streamlined,\ncommercial approach to getting this job done. A\n\xe2\x80\x9cbusiness-as-usual\xe2\x80\x9d approach cannot succeed within the\ntime and budget constraints that this important national\nprogram will be developed. Lockheed martin is actively\ninvestigating methods with NASA on the OSP program\nto address the expected concerns of the CAIB report.\nBudget concerns remain one of the most daunting issues\nfacing the OSP program. Current NASA budget\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nrequests for OSP were based on the old 2010/2012\ntarget dates and were considered by many as\ninadequate-particularly in the first 2 or 3 years of the\nprogram. Now that NASA is looking to accelerate the\nprogram, the funding issue becomes even more critical.\nIn conjunction with a recent revision of the Integrated\nSpace Transportation Plan, NASA is preparing an\namended budget request that Congress will be asked to\nact upon in the fall of 2003. A substantial addition to\nthe OSP budget line for the next several years will be\nneeded in order to make the OSP program feasible.\n\n2008. We will bring the best experience from across the\nLockheed Martin Corporation and from industry\nteammates to provide the best OSP total system\nsolution. We believe that our baseline configuration for\nthe OSP provides the best balance between safety,\naffordability, risk, and evolvability to meet future\nhuman space transportation needs.\n\nThe United States Congress is rightly asking for strong\nrationale for how the Orbital Space Plane system will\nmeet the near-term ISS rescue and transfer needs while\nproviding building blocks for \xe2\x80\x9cwhat comes next.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA final and most important issue to be addressed is the\nneed to establish the final set of OSP requirements by\nthis fall so that the solutions developed for the System\nDesign Review and for the full-scale development\nproposals can be based on a true foundation of need\nversus \xe2\x80\x9cthis is what we think you want.\xe2\x80\x9d Once\nestablished and approved, the entire NASNcontractor\ncommunity must rally behind them and work to resist\nthe requirements \xe2\x80\x9ccreep\xe2\x80\x9d that invariably leads to\nschedule slips and budget overruns. The\nNASNcontractor team that builds the OSP must prove\nthat it can execute to the schedule and budget proposed\nor the program could very well meet the same fate as\nmany other ambitious NASA programs in the last\ndecade (cancellation). We owe our astronauts better.\nSUMMARY-B\n\nLockheed Martin fully supports NASA\xe2\x80\x99s effort to\nprovide crew rescue and crew transfer support to ISS by\n\n*AIAA member grade, job title.\n\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n"
