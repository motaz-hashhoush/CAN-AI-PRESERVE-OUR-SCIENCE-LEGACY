NASA thanks Mr. Charlie Davis, DRIG member, and\nMs. Colleen Steele, W/T Chen & Company, for the initiation and production. Ms. Jan\nTimmons, Earth Science Support Office for editing; and Ms. Kelly Kavanaugh, Earth\nScience Support Office, for design, layout, and production of this guide\nThe information contained in this document should not be interpreted as an endorsement, recommendation, or guarantee for any person or product, nor does a listing\nhere imply a connection with DRIG or MAPS-NET, or any organization that may distribute this guide. Vendors were invited to participate by submitting their products for\nreview, all the reviewed products are for the IBM/compatible environment. The review\nprocess was completed in June, 1993. Some products have since changed their specifications or features, and new or upgraded products now may be available. You are\nencouraged to contact the vendors for the most current information.\nPlease note Federal Communications Commission (FCC) certification under Part 15 of\nthe FCC rules and regulations. Products that emit radio frequency (RF) energy should\nbe certified, indicating that the equipment complies with the standards specified in Part\n15 of the regulations. Certified equipment carries either a Class " A (meets institutional\nand educational standards) or "B" (meets the more stringent standards for home use)\ncertification. Each electronic component of a ground station should meet the Part 15\nstandards in order to minimize interference to equipment. Note that certification does\nnot apply to antennas or software, because they do not initiate RF energy.\n\nroducts were tested with the following standards in mind:\n\n1 . Ease of equipment use.\n2. User friendliness and completeness of equipment manual and instructions.\n3. Total system cost for computer, GOES, and APT capability is under $4,000.\n4. Vendor stability in the industry.\n\nJanuary 1994\n\nhat is Direct Readout\n\nEnvironmental satellites, equipped with a variety of sensors, monitor Earth and transmit\nthe information back to Earth electronically. These electronic signals can be received by\na ground station (also known as an Earth station), and displayed as images on a computer monitor. The capability to acquire inforrnation directly from environmental satellites produced the name direct readout.\nTwo types of environmental satellites provide direct readout service: geostationary and\npolar-orbiting. Their orbits and sensor equipment determine the scope and image resolution the satellites provide, as well as the equipment necessary to receive the data.\nThe United States, Japan, Russia, and the European Space Agency currently operate\nenvironmental satellites that have direct readout capability. China operates environmental\nsatellites but has discontinued direct readout services.\nImage resolution describes the area represented by each picture element (pixel) in an\nimage. The smaller the resolution number, the more detailed the image. For example,\n8-kilometer resolution means each pixel represents a square having 8 km on a side, a\nlower resolution than 4 kilometers (each pixel representing a square with 4 km on a side).\n\neostationary Orbits\n\nGeostationary spacecraft orbit the Earth at a speed and altitude that allows them\nto hover continuously over one area of the Earth\'s surface, providing continuous\ncoverage of that area. U.S. coverage is provided by Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellites (GOES).One of the GOES communication functions is to\nprovide Weather Facsimile (WEFAX)services. \\WEFAX data, with a resolution of 8 kilometers, consists of retransmissions of processed GOES images, polar-orbiter data, and\nother meteorological information. With its seemingly stationary position relative to\nEarth, a result of its orbit 22,238 miles above Earth, GOES provides views of almost a\nthird of the Earth\'s surface. Images from GOES combined with images from Japanese\nand European Space Agency geostationary satellites provide a global view of the\nEarth\'s environment.\n\nolar Orbits\n\nPolar-orbiting satellites orbit approximately 600 miles above Earth, providing a more\ndetailed look at a smaller area. Their orbital paths cross almost directly over the poles,\nand their sun-synchronous orbits mean that they cross the equator at the same time\neach day. U.S. polar orbiters, called TlROS satellites, provide low-resolution imagery\ncalled Automatic Picture Transmission (APT).APT is real-time data, with a resolution of\n4 kilometers, that can be obtained when the satellite is within the receiving area of a\nground station antenna-approximately every 102 minutes. High Resolution Picture\nTransmission (HRPT) from polar-orbiters has data resolution of 1 . 1 kilometers, but\nrequires more costly equipment to obtain it.\nEither WEFAX or APT services enable the user to obtain substantial environmental data.\nA dual system that accesses both types of data provides a comprehensive and continuous picture of the environment. Continuing technology improvements and cost reduction make that feasible and possible in a low-cost system.\n\nPT & GOES Ground Station\n\n-\n\nThe configuration shown is for a dual (APT and GOES) ground station. Even this basic\nset-up will vary among manufacturers. For example, some systems don\'t need a level\nadjust box or A-B switch box. The antenna switch box is needed only when accessing\nboth APT and GOES data with a receiver that has a single antenna input.\n\nFeedhorn\n\nDownconverter\n\nA less expensive option is to set up a system that accesses only WEFAX or APT. Consider\nwhether that ground station will eventually become a dual system, and if so, select\ncomponents that will support additions and upgrades.\nExamine the total station needs in advance, both to project costs and to obtain all the\ncomponents. Additional materials to set up the ground station shown above might\ninclude the following items:\nPre-amp & weatherproof housing\n= Coaxial cable (such as Belden\n\n99 13,931 I , or equivalent)\nAntenna tripod\nCoaxial connectors\nAntenna mast\nMale adaptor connectors\nPower/signal cable\n\nType "N" RF connectors\nPlastic electrical tape\nTY-RAPS wire ties\nHex/screw head bolts with nuts and washers\nBagged white sand or other antenna ballast\nPlywood for tripod mounting\nA/B antenna switch\n\nBM/Compatible Computers should meet these minimum specifications:\n386/33 MHz computer 64K cache* w / 4 Mt3 RAM*\nSVGA monitor 1024 x 768 x 256 .28 dot pitch non-interlackd\nSVGA graphics card with 1 Mb RAM 1024 x 768 x 265\n200-watt power supply\nStandard mid-sized case\nI/O card with I serial port and 1 parallel port\nMS DOS installed (Version 5 or later)\n120 MB IDE hard drive\n5 1 /4 inch floppy drive\n3 1 /2 inch floppy drive\nIDE hard drive/floppy drive controller\n1 0 1 keyboard enhanced\nPower supply with surge suppression distribution device\nMicrosoft or other compatible mouse\n(adaptor card may be required if external modem is used)\n2400 to 9600 baud modem (with cables if external)\nMath co-processor\nVESA support\nOptional\nSatellite tracking program\nComputer painting program such as P PAINT 5+\nC\nDot matrix or laser printer and cable\n* Quorum Communications recommends 256K cache with 8 MB RAM\n\nQ\n\npple and Macintosh Specifications:\nCheck with vendors. Macintosh currently is the most expensive environment for direct\nreadout. Apple and Macintosh systems now offer fewer sources, software, and options\nfor direct readout than IBM/compatible systems.\n\nFirst in, first out. Electronic storage device known as a buffer, fifo slows data down to a\nrate the computer can accept.\n\nulti-tasking Environment\nMulti-tasking environments permit the software window to be reduced and another\nprogram, such as a satellite tracking program, to run either on screen or in the background. Microsoft Windows is an example of ;3 multi-tasking environment. The software included in this guide from Lone Eagle Systems and Tri-Space operates in a\nmulti-tasking environment.\nMost satellite imaging programs will not currently run in a multi-tasking environment\nbecause they use most of the computer\'s memory to complete their task. If you plan to\nuse Microsoft Windows, OS/2, or Quarterdeck3 Deskview, consult your vendor to\ndetermine whether the product under consideration will run in that environment.\n\nile Compression Types\n\nFile compression is a process for reducing binary computer data files into a format that\nuses less of the computer\'s memory. Because savinq satellite imaqes can consume larqe\namounts of memory, conserving &sk space becomes an importa-rnt consideration. he\nmost commonly used compression formats are listed in descending order of popularity.\n\nI. GIF\n\n4. JPG\n\n2. PCX\n\n5. RLE\n\n3. TIF\n\n6. BMP\n\nSatellite imaging programs can save files in a variety of formats but most commonly use\nPCX or TIE Computer paint programs most commonly use PCX or TIE However, most\nimage viewing software use GIF or PCX formats. Programs such as Graphics Workshop,\na shareware computer program that can be obtained from the MAPS-NET Bulletin\nBoard (410) 239-4247, or DRlG Bulletin Board (2 14) 394-7438, can convert files from\none format to another, ensuring compatibility for various applications.\nFiles of each compression type can be identified by the extension in the file name\n(filename.PCX).Shareware programs are available on local computer bulletin boards.\nUpgraded versions are available from the programmer for a modest fee-usually from\nten to twenty dollars.\n\nround Station Features to Consider\n\nConsult the Matrix of Electronics Cards (page 18) and the Matrix of Software\nCapabilities (page 19) for listings of options to consider when selecting a system.\n\nhe Equipment\n\nComponents are grouped by type (receivers, antennas, etc.) and listed alphabetically\nby vendor. The imaging cards and software are grouped together because many of\nthese items are sold as a package.\nAll the imaging cards are capable of receiving both APT and WEFAX.\n\nIMAGING\nCARDS\nAND SOFTWARE\nroduct: Eagles View\nCompatible products:\nProduct use:\nFCC certification:\nPrice:\nVendor:\n\nWEFAX Explorer, WEFAX-2, PC-137\nImaging software package\nNot applicable to software\n$695\nLone Eagle Systems, Inc.\n5968 Wenrlingoff Road\nOmaha, Nebraska 68 134\n(402) 57 1-0 1 02\n(402) 572-0745 (fax)\n\nEagles View is the first and only multi-tasking package available outside of a Windows\nenvironment.

Click to select one of the many functions, including onscreen tracking and ingest. A full set of N O M enhancement palettes, and image\nstretching and enhancement are included. Custom palettes make it easy to enhance\nimages. SATMAPPER, a gridding program to place country, state, and latitude/longitude lines on a captured image, was the first gridding program on the market, and to\ndate is the most accurate. SATMAPPER works with Winsat 1.0 in either Windows or the\nDO8 environment. Image enhancements and stretching can be correlated with temperature on infrared images. Because of its Windows framework, images can be saved\nin a variety of common formats including BMT;\' GI6 TIE and PCX.\nThe Lockheed electronics card has been around for some time and originally was\nnamed the A & M card. Weather Radio, the receiver control program, operates in both\nthe Windows and DO8 environment. Weather Radio works with the PC-137 receiver\nfrom Quorum Communications and the Vanguard WEPIX-2000B. A click of the button\nselects the receiver mode and frequency in the PC-137.\n\nNoise inhibits the production of a clear image; thus, an external amplifier, placed close\nto the antenna, provides the necessary signal amplification to insure a good signal-tonoise ratio. The pre-amp should be mounted at the antenna with a good quality cable\nsuch as Belden 99 1 3 or 93 1 I .\n\ne\n\nroduct: PC-1 37 receiver\nCompatible products:\nProduct use:\nFCC certification:\nPrice:\nVendor:\n\nWEFAX-2, Weatherfax, SDSFAX\nInternal receiver\nSubmitted and verified\n$419\nQuorum Communications, Inc.\n8304 Esters Road, Suite 850\nIrving, Texas 75063\n(214) 9 15-0256\n(2 1 4) 9 1 5-0270 (fax)\n\nThe PC- 137 is the first internal receiver and allows full scanning of the 137 MHz band.\nThe software-controlled receiver supports both VHF and UHF inputs, and provides\nfused protection for an external 12-volt power supply to a downconverter. The receiver\nis built on a half-slot IBM plug-in card with all power for the receiver\'s operation coming\nfrom the computer\'s power source. External audio output is available on the card for\nuse with other vendor products such as SDSFAX, SDSFAX-PLUS, WeatherFAX, Lockheed,\nand Eagles View.\n\nroduct: WEPIX-2000B receiver\nCompatible products:\nProduct use:\nFCC certification:\nPrice:\nVendor:\n\nESC-I 02, WEFAX-2, MULTIFAX, WEATHERFAX\nReceiver\nNot certified\n$350\nVanguard Electronic Labs\n196-23 Jamaica Avenue\nHollis, New York 1 1423\n(7 18) 468-2720\n\nThe WEPlX receiver has been employed by APT and WEFAX users worldwide for years.\nThe WEPIX-2000B provides push-button selection of all known APT frequencies. A flick\nof a switch allows the downconverted GOES signal to be tuned. The unit is built into a\nfull metal enclosure the size of a modem and requires a 12-volt power source. Outputs\non the back of the receiver will accommodate a tape recorder and a meter to monitor\nthe signal of the transmitting spacecraft. The use of a pre-amplifier is not required on\ncable runs less than I 0 0 feet.\n\needline\n\nThe antenna feedline is perhaps the most important component in a ground station. A\ngood feedline will provide maximum signal while reducing stray RF or man-made noise\n(interference).Coaxial cable is feedline whose center conductor has been encased in\ndielectric material with an outer braided shield. The shielding greatly reduces the introduction of R or man-made noise into the receiving system.\nF\nCable such as Beldin 99 13 and 93 1 1 have a special foil wrap around the dielectric in\naddition to the copper braid. 93 1 1 cable is approximately 1 /4 inch in diameter and a\ngood pick for cable runs less than one hundred feet. 99 13 is about 1 / 2 inch in diameter, and will necessitate additional coaxial cable adapters if the antenna or receiver\nrequire a BNC-type of connection. The adapters can be purchased from an electronics\nstore for approximately $2 each. Support for the cable must be provided at BNC connection to avoid damage to its mated connector on the receiver or antenna.\nAvoid purchasing inexpensive cable that will not provide adequate shield or lasting\nconstruction. Vendors can supply this as well as put connectors on the cable for a\nsmall additional fee. Installation of the antenna may require cable to be fed through\nsmall holes drilled into walls or ceilings. For that reason, it would be wise to have only\none connector put on the cable before installation, because additional pre-installed\nconnectors may hamper running the cable.\n\nnstallation\n\nNever:\n\nRun the antenna feedline next to power lines or electric cables.\nBend the coaxial cable sharply.\nRun the cable through a window and shut the window on the cable.\nUse twist-on cable connectors.\nPull or twist connectors installed on the cable.\nAllow cable to be walked on or crushed.\nLeave the antenna feedline connected to your receiver during electrical\nstorms unless using a lightning arrester.\n\nAlways:\n\nSolder the shield of the coaxial cable to the connector\n(not applicable for crimp connectors).\nGround the antenna to a cold water pipe or grounding rod, or both.\nSecure the antenna feedline so that the wind cannot sway it.\nSeal the antenna connection with electrical tape or non-conductive sealant.\nPurchase the best cable available.\nReplace worn or broken cables ancl ground connections immediately.\nInspect the system at least once a year to reduce trouble-shooting time.\n\nAll antennas should have the best cable available to prevent various forms of noise\nfrom entering your system. Quality cable, such as Belden 99 13 or 93 1 1, can be purchased from electronic supply houses or vendors.\n\nroduct: V-20 Quadrifiler Helix Antenna\nCompatible products:\nProduct use:\nPrice:\nVendor:\n\nESC- 1 02, WEPIX-2000-B, PC- 1 37, WEFAX Explorer\nAPT ground station antenna\n$625\nQuorum Communications, Inc.\nSuite 850, 8304 Esters Road\nIrving, Texas 75063\n(2 1 4) 9 1 5-0256\n(2 I 4) 9 1 5-0270 (fax)\n\nDesigned for space communications, it provides the user with better signal coverage\nthan a turnstile antenna.

It has a typical noise figure\nof 1 dB and a gain of 50 dB. The unit is housed in a metal case with two mounting\nholes for mounting on or near the WEFAX antenna. Power can be supplied either by a\nseparate 1 2-volt source applied directly to the unit, or from a separate power supply\nfeeding the PC-137 receiver or the WEFAX Explorer card. The output from either is\nfused to protect both the pre-amplifier/downconverter and the PC-connected receiver\nand demodulator card. This unit is very stable in any environment and requires no\nmaintenance. A Type "N" connector is located on the bottom of the unit and connects\nto the feedhorn/antenna; a BNC connector also is located on the bottom of the unit\nthat connects to a 137 MHz receiver. A solder type post also is located on the bottom\nof the unit for external 12-volt supply connection.\n\nA pre-amplifier is an active device placed between the antenna and the receiver that\namplifies the incoming 137 MHz signal. A pre-amplifier should be used in all antenna\nsystems where the receiver gain is in question and noise prevents receiving a clean image.\nHowever; the trade-off to an amplified signal may be amplified ground-based noise as well.\n\nroduct: 1 0 4 - 6\n\nCompatible products:\nProduct use:\nFCC certification:\nPrice:\nVendor:\n\nWEPIX-2000B, PC-137\nAntenna pre-amplifier\nNot certified\n$75\nVanguard Electronic Labs\n196-23 Jamaica Avenue\nHollis, New York T 1423\n(7 18) 468-2720\n\nThe antenna pre-amplifier is powered by the receiver; the coaxial cable connecting the\npre-amplifier to the receiver provides the conduit for the DC voltage necessary to operate the unit. The unit has two BNC connectors to connect to the antenna and the\nfeedline. The unit is constructed of a small aluminum box that is not waterproof and\nshould be protected from the elements. Vanguard also sells mounting hardware and a\nsuitable PVC tube for water protection.\n\nThis does not represent an endorsement, recommendation, or guarantee for any person or product,\nnor does a listing here imply a connection with DRlG or MAPS-NET.
