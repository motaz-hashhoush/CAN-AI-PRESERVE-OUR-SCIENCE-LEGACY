b'A unique role that man plays in the United States\nspace program began when Astronaut EdwardH. White II\n\nleft the protective environment of his Gemini IV\nspacecraft cabin and ventured into deep space. His excursion -to perform a special set of procedures in a new\nand hostile environment marked the start of the unique\nscience of Extravehicular Activity (EVA).\nGemini misons proved N A to be a viable technique\nfor performing orbital missior! operations outside the\nspacecraft crew compartment. Then, as Gemini evolved\ninto Apollo. and Apollo into Skylab. EVA mission objectives pushed the science and art of EVA to their limit.\nNew, more sophisticated concepts and methods were\nperfected. extending man\'s capability to obtain productive scientific return from the space environment. And, of\ncourse. Skylab demonstrated the application of EVA techniques to unscheduled maintenance and repair operations\nsalvaging the program and inspiring its participants to new heights o acconiplishment.Because of this\nf\npast success and usefu!ness, EVA capability has been\nbaselined into the Space Shuttle program.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA). in its Shuttle Orbiter program, is currently preparing to delwer to orbit payloads that may vary considerably\nin design and purpose. The payload may be a laooratory\nhousing single biological cells or hausing several scientist astronauts. It may be an entire astronomy observatory\nor a "small" component of a mammoth solar power station. N A can provide sensible. reliable and cost-effective servicing operations for these payloam because EVA\ngives the payload designer the options of orbital equipment maintenance, repair and replacement without the\nneed to return the payload to Earth or, in the worst case, to\nabandon it as useless space junk. Having EVA capability\ncan help maximize tte scientific return of each nitssion.\nThis brochure is meant to \\)e a stimulus to the payload\ncommunity by providing an insight into the opportunities\nof EVA sufficient to establish EVA as a primary design\nconsideration.\n\n-\n\nP\nc\n\n---.\n\n._\n\n4\n\nc\n\nASTRONAUT EDWARD H.

The system\nis an electromechanical device. 15.2 meters (50 11) long. having shoulder, elbow\nand wrist joints along with an end effector The manipulator is cor\' ii!!ed from the\naft crew station on the Flight Deck through direct vision complemented by a closed\ncircuit television system with cameras mounted on the manipulator arm and in the\nCargo Bay. The Shuttle Orbiter has baseiined one Remote Manipulator System\nmounted 99 the left side longeron of the Cargo Bay.\nDuring non-EVA periods. the Remote Manipulator System can remove payloads\nfrom the Cargo Bay and deploy them in a stabilizedcondition by the use of special\nguideways and retention devices. Stabilized payloads can also be retrieved for\nreturn-to-Earth or on-orbit servicing. Unique payload servicing requirements.\nhowever. may require the addition of payload-provided, special purpose end effectors.\nWhen used to assist the EVA crewmembers, the Remote Manipulator System\nr\nmay perform one o more of the following useful functions.\n\nIt can effect multiple transfers of equipment betweer, the EVA work area and the\nreplacement equipment stowage area.\nEquipped with handrails. it can be used by the EVA crewmember as a transiation path to remote areas on the payload or Orbiter that require servicing\nThe attached lights can be used to supply additional lighting at the work area.\nand the attached closed circuit TV camera can zld in payload inspection tasks\nand in task coordination with the other Orbiter crewmembers and with the\nground\n\nTools, Restraints, Ancillary Equipment\n\n4\n\nTHE REMOTE MANIPULATOR\nSYSTEM ir available t o aaalat EVA\ncrawmembarr in the tranrport and\nporitlonlng o large payload\nf\ncomponent@\ndurlngthe orbital\naammbly p r m s r and provider a\nready trmalation path between\nOrblter and payload.\n\nTo perform equipment maintenance. repair and replacement. the EVA\ncrewmember requires cec tain tools. tethers, restraints and portable workstations\nA standard off-the-shelf tool set will be available for use in supporting EVA\npayload operations These tools will be kept in the NASA ground inventory and\nflown as required for each payload Any payload-unique tools required will be furnished by the payload user A primary design goal. however, will be to design the\npayload components to be cost effective by allowing stande?

However, crew\nmobility and restraint provisions designed onto or into the payload as well as\nany special external or internal payload lighting fixtures must be payload provided and self sufficient.\nThe payload designer is encouraged to purchase and use standard, NASAspecified "unived" or "multimission" EVA support hardware where mssible\nin order to minii;iize R I A crew training. operational requirements and cost.\n\nManned Maneuvering Unit\nWith the Manned Maneuvering Unit. a propulsive backpack device, an EVA\ncrewmember can reach areas beyond the Cargo Bay he could not reach other\nwise. The unit. a modular device stowed in the Cargo Bay and readily attached\nto the Extravehicular Mobility Unit. can be donned. doffed and serviced by a\nsingle crewmember as needed during an EVA period\nSince the Manned Maneuvering Unit has a six-degree-of-freedom control\nauthority. an automatic attitude-hold capability and electrical outlets for Such\nancillary equipment as power tools. a portable light. cameras and instrument\nmonitoring devices. the unit is quite versatile and adaptable to many payload\ntask requirements.\nMoreover, Since the unit need not be secured to the Obiter by tethers or\nother restraining devices. the crewmember can use it t:, "fly" unencumbered to\nberthed or free-flying spacecraft work areas, transport cargo of moderate size\nsuch as might be required for spacecraft servicing on orbit and retrieve small,\nfree-flyingpayloads which may be sensitive to Orbiter thruster perturbation and\ncontamination (the unit\'s own low-thrust, dry, cold gas nitrogen propellant\ncauses minimal disturbance with no adverse contamination).

First, an EVA system can allow\nsignificant design simplifications saving dollars otherwise needed tor\nautomation Consequently, specialized crew training in complex hardware is reduced, minimizing or eliminating "flight specific" training requirements. Also, as a result of their "advanced" tratning, which is free\nto the user, Orbiter crewmembers assigned to a specific payload mission will be able to accomplish many standxdized EVA tasks. By using\nas many of these standardized EVA tasks as possible in the design of\nhis system, the user can save additional training dollars\n\n15\n\nI\nt\n?\nI\n\nProgram Features\nEven on the clearest d days and nights. the atmospnertc envelcpe encasing the E stgniftcantly degrades\nm\nastan~mical\nCXtsewvatiOn In attempts to gaze through 11. the astronomer tin& the sight disforled and biwred\n\nPursuit\nMan has only begun to realize his achievement potential in meeting the scientific and environmental\nchallenges above his planet Extravehicular Activity has\nbeen shown to be one effective means of capitalizing on\nthis potential Other methcds ,e available to meet exr\nperirnen! task objectives Automated techniques and solo\nRemote Manipulator System utilization are viable means\nof meeting specific payload orbital operations \'equirements But. as in the case of EVA. each method has :ts\nlimitations. operational constraints and relative costeffectiveness The payload designer must be thoroughly\nfamiliarized with the various modes of task accomplishment in order to arrive at the best solution for applicatior\nto the payload, one that is economical by design and\nreliable in operation.\nWithin the Johnson Space Center Crew Training and\nProcedures Division. the EVA Systems Section provides\nliaison with the payload community for experiment EVA\noperations development Engineers in this section have\nmultiprogram EVA experience which enables them to\nconsult with interested payload principal investigators\nand designers and to assist them in determining the EVA\npotential for their payload and in optimizing its use.\nIn addition to providing EVA operations consultatim.\nthe EVA Systems Section publishes the JSC Shuttle EVA\nDescription and Design Criteria document (ref 1) The\npurpose of this document is to prwide engineering personnel and payload principal investigatms involved in\nEVA design. planning. operations and training with the\ndefinition of Orbiter EVA provisions. equipment and\noperations along with hardware design requirements and\ncapabilities of the EVA crewmembers\nFor Orbiterlpayload interface information. the payload\ndesigner is further directed to the Johnson Space Center\nSpace Shuttle System Payload Accommodations\ndocument (ref. 2) which describes the capabilities of the\nSpace Shuttle System to accommodate payloads and\ndefines the interfaces between the Space Shuttle System\nand the Shuttle payloads\n\n4\n\nONE MAN\'S LIFETIME-^ canvas\nchronokgy of man\'s aerospace\ninventiveness spannin9 the last seven\ndecades\n19\n\nReferences\n1\n\nShuttle EVA Descr:cr!or! and Design Cr,feria.
