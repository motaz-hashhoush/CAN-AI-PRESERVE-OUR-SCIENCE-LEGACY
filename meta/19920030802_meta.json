Three hydrogen tanks are mated to a spacecraft bus that is similar to that used for three-axis-controlled satellites. The bus provides power, communications, and attitude control along with acceleration levels ranging from 10 exp -6 to 10 exp -4 g. At launch, all the liquid hydrogen is contained in the largest tank, which has an insulation system designed for both space operation and the short-term launch pad and ascent environment. This tank is much lighter and lower in cost than a vacuum-jacketed design, and is made possible by the experiment tanking options available due to the hydrogen-fueled Centaur upper stage of the Atlas I.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19920030802, "endDate": "1989-07-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "1989 Cryogenic Engineering Conference", "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": "907f5c145d994021b51cceb0dccd6491", "startDate": "1989-07-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920030802, "id": "f22c4051f26f4092a3410ef13ba3469e", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
