Annual reports have summarized much of the work accomplished; here we provide a brief review of the work resulting from this effort, and a summary of the personnel who have benefited from the grant's support. Starburst Galaxies with Extreme X-ray Luminosities This project began as a careful examination of the claims of Boller et al. (1992) that there were dozens of \"normal\" galaxies in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey that had X-ray luminosities in excess of 1042 erg sec, higher than that seen in the hundreds of non-AGN galaxies observed with Einstein. If true, this suggested that X-ray emission associated with star formation activity might have a significant contribution to make to the still unexplained cosmic X-ray background (XRB). Since some of our earlier work with the Einstein Observatory Deep Surveys had suggested a similar possibility and several sets of authors over the years had modelled the starburst XRB contribution, these claims were worth pursuing. Our work expanded the examination beyond the RASS to include earlier claims of high-luminosity galaxies powered by starburst emission (selected in this case on the basis of the far-IR luminosities). The result of extensive followup observations under several programs using ROSAT, ASCA, and ground-based facilities was to show that nearly all of these objects in fact have hidden AGN at their cores, and that their luminosities are not in any way extraordinary.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990009047, "id": "58e057f00b684c8ba6a94a6c23617923", "publicationDate": "1998-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990009047.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990009047/downloads/19990009047.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990009047/downloads/19990009047.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990009047/downloads/19990009047.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
