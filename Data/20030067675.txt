b'AT SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (SAIC), CAPE CANAVERAL OFFICE, WE\'RE\nUSING A PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT FACILITATES TEAM COMMUNICATION, KEEPS OUR\n\n/\n\nPROJECT TEAM FOCUSED, STREAMLINES WORK AND IDENTIFIES POTENTIAL ISSUES. WHAT DID IT\nCOST US TO INSTALL THE TOOL? ALMOST NOTHING.\n\nTHEBASIC INGREDIENTS\ninclude a 12-foot-long tack board strip on the wall, a\npack of thumbtacks, paper, and a writing instrument. We\nuse our storyboard to create a paper prototype of our\nproduct. Graphic, sequential depictions give a quick\nproject overview while breaking down the product into\nits major components.\nThough it could be applied to any type of project,\nwe have found that the storyboard concept is ideally\nsuited for software development. For example, many\nmembers of a software development team are specialists\nat coding and can get caught up in a particular function\nor aspect of the project. The storyboard helps them\nO R TOOL IS A STORYBOARD.\nU\n\n24 APPL THE NASA ACADEMY OF PROGRAM AND PROJECT LEADERSHIP\n\nconceptualize the relationships between project\ntasks and the bigger picture. Seeing the big\npicture was a particular problem for us on our\ncurrent project, so we posted a copy of a story by\nDr. Michelle Collins, "Lessons From the Great\nMasters" (ASK 3),to try to help the team think at\na higher level and ask the right questions: What is\nthe operational concept of this product? What do\nwe really need to do first?\nMost of the board, however, reflects the major\nelements of the project. We tack sheets of paper on the\nwall in the sequence that users will likely perform their\ntasks. At first, we sketch out ideas with a few words\n\nor graphics; but as our storyboard\nprogresses, we replace the words with\nscreen shots and major elements begin to\nevolve \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d the storyboard.\nThe storyboard process helps promote\nbrainstorming, highlights missing tasks, and\nallows the team to incorporate changes prior\nto traveling too far down a particular path.\nIt also helps us to stand back from our work\nand ask, \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the most logical sequence\nfor the way we\xe2\x80\x98re doing things?\xe2\x80\x9c We physically move pages around and put them in a\ndifferent order as we resolve issues. The\nnumber of revisions done to the storyboard is\nbased on a project\xe2\x80\x99s schedule and budget constraints.\nThe storyboard also gives us maximum exposure.\nDuring our \xe2\x80\x9cgraffiti phase,\xe2\x80\x9d anyone in the organization\n(potential users, customers, and team members alike)\ncan learn about our entire project by walking down the\nline of papers conveniently located in the office hallway.\nWhen they see something that doesn\xe2\x80\x98t make sense to\nthem or they think of a feature that might be added, they\nwrite down their comments directly on the sheet of\npaper on the wall. For example, one person wrote on the\nstoryboard, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a procedure is executed where are\nthe results stored?\xe2\x80\x9d Thanks to this comment, we\nrealized we were so focused on the procedure itself that\nwe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought about where the documentation of\nthe procedure would be stored. How could we track and\n\n/\n\ndisplay the information without cluttering the screen?\nWould our repository be on individual hard drives or a\nshared network? The comment helped us to step back\nfrom our work and look at it from a user\xe2\x80\x99s perspective.\nWe have a designated keeper of the storyboard\nwhose job it is to evaluate those comments and meet\nwith the team to see which ideas should be implemented\ninto our planning. If we decide to use an idea, it becomes\npart of our evolving storyboard. When we recognize\ngood ideas that are outside our current scope, they are\nconsolidated and tacked at the end of the storyboard on\na separate page called \xe2\x80\x9cFuture Features.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBy using the storyboard, we get many people\ninvolved in providing constructive feedback and, most\nimportantly, we make certain that team members aren\xe2\x80\x99t\ngoing off in different directions. The storyboard keeps us\n0\nall working toward the same goal.\n\nTRADING PLACES\nAs part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s newly established Industry\n\nExchange Program (IEP), CHERYL A. MALLOY\nbegan a nine-month assignment with SAIC in\nDecember 2002. IEP promotes the exchange of ideas, best\npractices, and operational insights between NASA and its\nindustry partners by arranging temporary assignment\nexchanges. During her tenure at SAIC, Malloy had the\nopportunity to work with several program and project\nmanagers at SAIC, including WILLIAM COOLEY, a technical\nanalyst who specializes in merging software\nwith physics.
