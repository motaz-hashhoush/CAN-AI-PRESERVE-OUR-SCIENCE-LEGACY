The\nobjective of this task is to make major progress towards developing a new computational tool with new capabilities for simulating cylindrically symmetric 2.5 dimensional\n(2.5 D) PPA\xe2\x80\x99s. This tool may be used for designing, optimizing, and understanding the operation of PPA\xe2\x80\x99s and other pulsed power devices. The foundation for this\ntask is the 2 D, cylindrically symmetric, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code PCAPPS\n(Princeton Code for Advanced Plasma Propulsion Simulation). PCAPPS was originally developed by Sankaran (2001, 2005) to model Lithium Lorentz Force Accelerators\n(LLFA\xe2\x80\x99s), which are electrode based devices, and are typically operated in continuous\nmode. The magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld in this code only has an azimuthal component. For the\nPPA project, PCAPPS was modi\xef\xac\x81ed to apply to PPA\xe2\x80\x99s, which are drive coil based\ndevices operated in pulsed mode. The modi\xef\xac\x81cation consists of changing the geometry\nof the computational domain, adding the radial component of the magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld to\nthe model, and implementing a \xef\xac\x81rst principles, self-consistent algorithm to couple the\nplasma and power circuit that drives the plasma dynamics. This coupling algorithm\nis the most important result of the modeling e\xef\xac\x80ort so far. As in reality, the coupling\noccurs through the current and electric \xef\xac\x81eld in the drive coil. At a given time t the\ncurrent in the drive coil provides a boundary condition for PCAPPS, allowing the code\nto be advanced to the next time step t + \xe2\x88\x86t. Then the voltage drop Vplasma (t + \xe2\x88\x86t)\nacross the drive coil due to the plasma electric \xef\xac\x81eld is computed and represented in the\npower circuit equations as an EMF in series with the drive coil\xe2\x80\x99s resistance and inductance. The plasma electric \xef\xac\x81eld is computed from the Ohm\xe2\x80\x99s law used in PCAPPS,\nand includes all e\xef\xac\x80ects of the plasma dynamics on the power circuit. The voltage drop\nacross the drive coil is Vplasma plus the voltage drops across the drive coil\xe2\x80\x99s resistance\nand inductance. The power circuit equations are then solved to determine the drive coil\ncurrent at time t + \xe2\x88\x86t, which provides an updated boundary condition for PCAPPS.\nThis iterative algorithm is applied at each time step. The coupling algorithm appears\nto be new. It is general in that it allows any Ohm\xe2\x80\x99s law, and any power circuit that\ncouples to the plasma through a drive coil to be included in any PPA simulation. The\nbasic structure of PCAPPS, including these modi\xef\xac\x81cations, is described. Simulations\nof pulsed inductive thrusters (PIT\xe2\x80\x99s) having drive coil radii of 5.5 cm and 13.5 cm, and\nfor Lithium and Argon propellants are presented. For these simulations, the thruster\nis powered by a capacitor in an LRC circuit using values of L,R, and C characteristic\nof TRW PIT thruster experiments. The objective of the modeling task was achieved\nin that: (1) An apparently new, self consistent, general, \xef\xac\x81rst principles based power\ncircuit-plasma coupling algorithm was conceived and implemented; (2) Major modi\xef\xac\x81cations were successfully made to PCAPPS as part of the longer range objective to\nmake the code fully 2.5 D.\n\n1\nviii\n\n1.0 The Model\n1\nPCAPPS is a two dimensional, cylindrically symmetric MHD code. Cylindrical coordinates\n(r, \xce\xb8, z) are used. z is the coordinate along the axis of the cylinder, r is the distance from the\ncylinder axis, and all quantities are independent of \xce\xb8. The drive coil is a disk in the plane\nz = 0.

The anomalous component of the total resistivity\n\xce\xb7, due to microinstabilities, is derived by Choueiri [4]. The empirical function L(Te ) that\noccurs in the radiative loss term in the energy equation (6) is given by Post et al. [5] for a\nLithium plasma. This function is also used in PCAPPS to describe radiative loss in Argon.\nIt is found by Sankaran (2005) that radiative loss is not a signi\xef\xac\x81cant cooling mechanism\nfor LLFA plasmas. The same is true for the PPA plasmas considered here since they are\ncharacterized by similar temperature and density ranges.\nThe terms involving Br and j\xce\xb8 in equations (1) - (6) are not in the original version of\nPCAPPS. They are implemented here to extend the capability of PCAPPS to modeling\nPPA\xe2\x80\x99s. As in the original version of PCAPPS, the \xce\xb8 component of the momentum equation,\nand all terms involving Bz are not included in the model. The extension of PCAPPS presented here is the simplest one that allows for modeling PPA\xe2\x80\x99s. An extension of PCAPPS\nto allow for modeling general 2.5 D, cylindrically symmetric plasma dynamics must include\nthe \xce\xb8 component of the momentum equation, and all terms involving Bz . PCAPPS will be\nmodi\xef\xac\x81ed to include this equation and these terms in the second phase of the project during\n2006 - 2007.\nA simple analysis was done to estimate the error involved in omitting the \xce\xb8 component\nof the momentum equation, and the terms involving Bz when modeling PIT type devices.\nThis analysis and its results are described as follows. The azimuthal component of the\nmomentum equation may be written as dv/dt = (j \xc3\x97 B)\xce\xb8 \xe2\x89\xa1 F\xce\xb8 , where dv/dt is the convective\n(Lagrangian) time derivative of the azimuthal component v of the velocity. Similarly, the\nother components of the momentum equation may be written as du/dt = (j \xc3\x97 B)r \xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x88\x82p/\xe2\x88\x82r \xe2\x89\xa1\nFr , dw/dt = (j \xc3\x97 B)z \xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x88\x82p/\xe2\x88\x82z \xe2\x89\xa1 Fz . For a typical simulation of a PIT, described later in\n<\nthis report, it is found that |F\xce\xb8 | \xe2\x88\xbc |Fr | \xe2\x88\xbc 10\xe2\x88\x923 |Fz | at time t = 1.41 \xc2\xb5 sec when the current in\nthe power circuit reaches its \xef\xac\x81rst peak, and |F\xce\xb8 | \xe2\x88\xbc (10\xe2\x88\x922 \xe2\x88\x92 10\xe2\x88\x921 )|Fr | \xe2\x88\xbc |Fz | at t = 7.25 \xc2\xb5 sec\nwhen the current in the power circuit reaches its second peak. This inequality is maintained\nfor the remainder of the simulation. These results suggest that if the azimuthal component\nof the momentum equation is included in the model, only a relatively small azimuthal \xef\xac\x82ow\nspeed is generated, in which case the error in omitting this equation is small. The error in\nomitting terms containing Bz is estimated by using the axial component of Faraday\xe2\x80\x99s law,\ngiven by \xe2\x88\x82Bz /\xe2\x88\x82t = \xe2\x88\x92( \xc3\x97 E)z , with E given by the Ohm\xe2\x80\x99s law of the model. For the\nsame PIT simulation,\n\xc3\x97 E is computed, and its r, \xce\xb8, and z components are compared.\nThe result is that |( \xc3\x97 E)z | \xe2\x88\xbc 10\xe2\x88\x921 |( \xc3\x97 E)\xce\xb8 | \xe2\x88\xbc |( \xc3\x97 E)r | at t = 1.41 \xc2\xb5 sec, and\n|( \xc3\x97 E)z | \xe2\x88\xbc |( \xc3\x97 E)\xce\xb8 | \xe2\x88\xbc (10\xe2\x88\x922 \xe2\x88\x92 10\xe2\x88\x921 )|( \xc3\x97 E)r | at t = 7.25 \xc2\xb5 sec. These results suggest\nthat for a PIT type device the e\xef\xac\x80ects of Bz are small compared with those of Br , but may\nbe comparable with those of B\xce\xb8 . This is consistent with experimental results for the TRW\nPIT showing that almost no axial magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld is generated during device operation [6, 7].\ntasks of the follow on phase of the PPA project is to explore the error introduced by this approximation, and\ncompare PCAPPS and MACH2 with respect to how they treat the Hall terms, which can have important\ne\xef\xac\x80ects in 2 and 3 dimensions.\n\n3\n\n2\n\nEquations (1)-(6) must be supplemented by additional equations to complete the model.\nThese equations are the electron energy equation, the ideal gas equations of state for the\nelectrons and ions, the caloric equation of state for the electrons, and Saha\xe2\x80\x99s equation relating\nthe number densities of electrons and the several ionization stages of the ions.\nThe electron energy equation is given by\n\xe2\x88\x82\xce\xb5e 1 \xe2\x88\x82\n1 \xe2\x88\x82 (ru) \xe2\x88\x82w\n\xe2\x88\x82\n+\n(r\xce\xb5e u) +\n(\xce\xb5e w) + pe\n+\n\xe2\x88\x82t\nr \xe2\x88\x82r\n\xe2\x88\x82z\nr \xe2\x88\x82r\n\xe2\x88\x82z\n3ne me \xce\xbdei\n2\n2\n2\n= \xce\xb7 jr + jz + j\xce\xb8 \xe2\x88\x92\n\xce\xbaB (Te \xe2\x88\x92 Ti ) + \xc2\xb7 (\xce\xbath,e Te) .\nMi\n\n(7)\n\nHere \xce\xb5e , pe , me , Mi , kB , and \xce\xbdei are the electron energy density per unit volume, electron\npressure, electron mass, ion mass, Boltzmann\xe2\x80\x99s constant, and the electron-ion collision frequency.

The use of\nthis Saha equation is based on the assumptions that the distribution of the ions over their\ninternal energy levels (bound and continuum (ionized)) is determined entirely by electronion collisions, that this distribution is an equilibrium (Boltzmann) distribution, that the\nelectrons are in equilibrium at temperature Te , and that the distribution of the ions over\ntheir internal energy levels is in equilibrium with the electrons. The electrons and ions are\nassumed to respond instantaneously on MHD and radiative time scales to maintain these\nequilibrium conditions. A discussion of the conditions under which these assumptions are\nvalid is given in Sankaran (2001,2005) and references therein. Roughly, the assumptions are\nvalid if \xcf\x84ee\n\xcf\x84ei\nMHD and radiative transition time scales.

This problem\ndemands a self consistent treatment for an accurate solution since the power circuit-plasma\ncoupling is strongly bi-directional. The inductive electric \xef\xac\x81eld generated by the power circuit\nionizes and accelerates the propellant. The resulting plasma dynamics generates its own\nelectric \xef\xac\x81eld that reacts back on the power circuit, e\xef\xac\x80ectively having inductive and resistive\ne\xef\xac\x80ects on the circuit.\nThus far, there have been two basic approaches to modeling the power circuit - plasma\ncoupling. One approach is to treat the plasma as an LRC circuit inductively coupled to the\npower circuit [6], [7]. This approach includes bi-directional coupling, but the e\xef\xac\x80ect of the\ncomplex plasma dynamics on the power circuit is treated approximately in terms of lumped\ncircuit elements. The second approach is to drive the plasma with an experimentally determined drive coil current waveform [8]. Mikellides and Neilly perform MACH2 simulations\nof a PIT driven by such a waveform. This waveform is used to determine L, R, and C in\nthe equivalent LRC circuit that reproduces the current waveform. This approach, though\nbased on measurements of the current in an operating PIT, is uni-directional, and includes\nall e\xef\xac\x80ects of the power circuit and the plasma dynamics together through the values of L, R,\nand C. These restrictions of uni-directional coupling and lumped element circuit modeling\nof the e\xef\xac\x80ects of plasma dynamics are signi\xef\xac\x81cant, indicating the need for a bi-directional\ncoupling algorithm that includes the exact plasma dynamics.\nHere a simple, self consistent, \xef\xac\x81rst principles based algorithm for including the bidirectional power circuit-plasma coupling in PPA simulations is presented and implemented.\nThe algorithm is as follows. The e\xef\xac\x80ect of plasma dynamics on the power circuit must occur\nthrough the plasma electric \xef\xac\x81eld E acting on the charges in the drive coil. The e\xef\xac\x80ect of E is\nto alter the voltage Vd between the terminals of the drive coil from what it is in the absence\nof the plasma. The contribution Vplasma of E to Vd is exactly computed as the scalar line\nintegral of E along the wires between the terminals of the drive coil. Vplasma is then included\nas an EMF in series with the drive coil resistance and inductance in the circuit equations\ngoverning the time evolution of the current through the drive coil in the power circuit. Given\nVplasma at time t, the current I(t + \xe2\x88\x86t) in the drive coil is computed by solving these equations. I(t + \xe2\x88\x86t) is then used to determine an updated current density at the surface of\nthe drive coil, which provides an updated boundary condition for PCAPPS. This iterative\nprocedure is performed at each time step. E contains all e\xef\xac\x80ects of the plasma dynamics\non the power circuit, including time dependent resistive and inductive e\xef\xac\x80ects, regardless\nof the complexity of the plasma dynamics. Vd equals the sum of Vplasma and the voltage\ndrops across the R and L in the power circuit that represent the drive coil\xe2\x80\x99s resistance and\ninductance, which may be measured, and are independent of time.\nFor an arbitrary power circuit the algorithm is easily implemented using a circuit modeling software package such as PSPICE. The drive coil is represented in any power circuit\nas a constant inductance and resistance, and a time dependent Vplasma , all in series. The\nalgorithm iterates between PSPICE and PCAPPS as described above, with PSPICE providing an updated drive coil current boundary condition for PCAPPS, and PCAPPS providing\nVplasma at each time for PSPICE to compute a new drive coil current.\n5\n\n4\n\nAdditional insight into the coupling algorithm is gained by using the electromagnetic\nboundary condition which states that the tangential component of the total electric \xef\xac\x81eld is\ncontinuous across any material interface in its rest frame. Let Ewire be the electric \xef\xac\x81eld that\ndrives and is parallel to the current in the drive coil. Let Ep be the component of the plasma\nelectric \xef\xac\x81eld at the surface of, and parallel to the drive coil wires. The boundary condition\nrequires that Ewire = Ep +E , where E is the electric \xef\xac\x81eld at the boundary between the wires\nand the plasma volume that contains the e\xef\xac\x80ects of the drive coil\xe2\x80\x99s constant resistance and\ninductance on Vd . The scalar line integral of E along the wires between the terminals of the\ndrive coil equals the voltage drop across the drive coil due to this resistance and inductance.\nFor the simulations presented in this report the power circuit is an LRC circuit. The\nvalues of L, R, and C, and other simulation parameters are presented in \xc2\xa73.2. Fig. 1 is a\nschematic diagram of the power circuit-drive coil con\xef\xac\x81guration. The drive coil is shown as\na set of concentric wire rings. The axis of the rings is the z axis of the simulation, the\ndrive coil occupies the area de\xef\xac\x81ned by (z = 0, 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 r \xe2\x89\xa4 Rcoil ), and the wires run along the\n\xce\xb8 direction. This approximation derives from the design of the original TRW PIT drive\ncoil, which is comprised of 18 spiral strands of wire that can be accurately approximated\nas 9 concentric wire rings, each carrying an azimuthal current I. For the simulations, the\ndrive coil is assumed to be a continuous disk carrying a uniform (r independent), azimuthal\ncurrent density j\xce\xb8 given by\nI\n(12)\nj\xce\xb8 = ,\nA\nwhere A is the part of the cross sectional area of each wire in the drive coil through which\ncurrent \xef\xac\x82ows. It is given by\nA = \xcf\x80R2 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x80 (Rw \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb4)2 ,\n(13)\nw\nwhere Rw is a characteristic radius of a wire strand (Rw \xe2\x88\xbc 1 cm), and \xce\xb4 is the skin depth\nof copper at the natural frequency of the LRC circuit uncoupled from the plasma. Then\nthe current density at each of the guard cells in the simulation domain along the drive coil\nradius 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 r \xe2\x89\xa4 Rcoil at z = 0 is assigned the value j\xce\xb8 . j\xce\xb8 is updated at each time step, and\nprovides the MHD boundary condition at the drive coil that allows PCAPPS to compute\nthe state of the plasma at the next time step.\nThe circuit equations for the power circuit - plasma system are:\nV = RI + L\n\ndI\n+ Vplasma\ndt\n\nQ = CV\ndQ\n= \xe2\x88\x92I\ndt\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwhere V is the voltage across the capacitor, and Vplasma is obtained from:\nN\n\n0\n\nVplasma (t) =\n\nRi E\xce\xb8 (Ri , t).\n\nE \xc2\xb7 dl = 2\xcf\x80\nRouter\n\n(17)\n\ni=1\n\nHere E\xce\xb8 is the component of the plasma electric \xef\xac\x81eld at, and parallel to the drive coil wire\nrings, Ri is the radius of guard cell i from the z axis, and N is the number of guard cells\n6\n\n5\n\nFigure 1: Schematic of the Power Circuit - Plasma System\nalong the radial direction.

Here, and in most cases, the trial function is chosen\nto have unit value in a given cell j, and be zero otherwise. Then the integration over all space\nreduces the calculations to those involving a single cell j and its boundaries, as indicated in\nequation (22). Analytic calculations are then employed to determine the values of uj at cell\nboundaries in terms of its values at cell centers using a method developed by Roe [10]. This\nmethod is based on the analytic Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions.\nThe following example shows the e\xef\xac\x80ectiveness of the Roe method in resolving strong\ndiscontinuities, and serves as a test case for validating the modi\xef\xac\x81cation of PCAPPS. This\nexample consists of triggering a fast MHD shock wave by using a step function in Br as\nan initial condition, and then checking the degree to which the Rankine-Hugoniot jump\nconditions across the shock front are satis\xef\xac\x81ed. This step function is a change in Br from 500\nto 100 G at the drive coil. It models pulsing a PIT type device with a very short current rise\ntime. A shock wave develops as expected, with all pro\xef\xac\x81les steepening into discontinuities\nthat travel together at the same speed. The Rankine Hugoniot jump condition for each\npro\xef\xac\x81le is checked. For Br this condition is obtained from the Faraday law equation (5), and\nis given by\ns\xe2\x88\x86Br = \xe2\x88\x86Fz .\n(23)\nHere s is the shock speed, determined from the speed of the discontinuity in the simulation,\nand \xe2\x88\x86Br and \xe2\x88\x86Fz are the change of Br and its \xef\xac\x82ux across the discontinuity. The RankineHugoniot conditions are found to be satis\xef\xac\x81ed to within an error \xe2\x88\xbc 15%. This error is\nconsidered small since the simulation is 2 D while the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions\nare derived for a 1 D system.\n8\n\n7\n\nFigure 2: Flow Chart of the Power Circuit - Plasma Coupling Algorithm.\n\n9\n\n8\n\nAn additional test of the code modi\xef\xac\x81cation of adding Br to the model is to check the\ncoupling of Br and B\xce\xb8 by the Hall electrical conductivity. The test consisted of initializing\nBr as a sine wave, and then checking that a corresponding B\xce\xb8 is generated as a sine wave.\nThis was found to be the case. The two sine waves have approximately the same amplitude\nin the absence of the plasma resistivity \xce\xb7, as expected.\n\n3\n3.0 Examples of Simulations of Pulsed Plasma Accelerators\n3.1\n\nGeometry\n\nThe original version of PCAPPS uses a mesh of quadrilaterals to \xef\xac\x81t an LLFA geometry based\non the device design by Polk [11]. Here the geometry is modi\xef\xac\x81ed to that of a PIT. The radius\nRcoil of the drive coil is chosen to be 5.5 cm or 13.75 cm. The \xef\xac\x81rst value corresponds to a\ndrive coil area about 1.7 times smaller than that of a FARAD thruster [12]. The second value\ncorresponds to a drive coil area about 11 times smaller than that of the TRW PIT drive coil,\nwhich is an annulus with an inner radius of \xe2\x88\xbc 20 cm, and an outer radius of \xe2\x88\xbc 50 cm [6, 7].\nTherefore, the simulations presented here are for compact devices. It is important to note\nthat Rcoil is not the radius of the inlet, over which the propellant is uniformly distributed.\nThe inlet radii corresponding to the smaller and larger values of Rcoil are Rinlet = 11 cm\nand 27.5 cm, respectively. Simulations using TRW PIT size drive coils that cover the entire\ninlet area are currently being performed2 . As expected, they show much stronger coupling\nbetween the power circuit and plasma, leading to higher Isp . Fig. 3 shows the geometry and\nits mesh. The \xef\xac\x81gure shows an r \xe2\x88\x92 z plane cut through the cylindrically symmetric device.\nThe z axis is the axis of the device. The disk shaped drive coil is at the left end of the\ndevice, normal to the page. The z axis passes through the center of the drive coil at z = 0.\nThe current density at the drive coil is used as a boundary condition for the Faraday law\nequations for Br and B\xce\xb8 , allowing PCAPPS to advance the magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld in time. All other\nboundaries are treated as free stream boundaries.\n\n3.2\n\nSimulation Parameters\n\nThe values L = 100 nH, C = 9\xc2\xb5f, R = 6.7 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923 \xe2\x84\xa6, and V0 = 30 kV are chosen for all\nsimulations. These values are characteristic of TRW PIT experiments [7]. It is assumed the\npropellant \xef\xac\x81lls the entire computational volume with an initial density n0 = 1021 m\xe2\x88\x923. This\nvalue may be compared with the value n0 \xe2\x88\xbc 8.7 \xc3\x97 1021 m\xe2\x88\x923 corresponding to actual TRW\nPIT experiments in which a 3 cm thick layer of 2 mg of Li propellant is distributed over\na drive coil area \xe2\x88\xbc 0.66 m2. The initial ionization level is assumed to be 5%. Simulations\nare performed using Li and Ar propellants, the di\xef\xac\x80erence between the two cases being the\ncorresponding equations of state and mass densities. The assumption of propellant \xef\xac\x81lling\nthe entire computational volume is not realistic. Simulations using a more realistic initial\n2\nThe inlet is a remnant of the original LLFA geometry in PCAPPS. Current simulations, not described\nin this report, e\xef\xac\x80ectively replace the inlet by the drive coil, and extend the radius of the drive coil to the\nboundary of the computational domain.\n\n10\n\n9\n\nFigure 3: Device geometry. r and z are in meters.\ndensity pro\xef\xac\x81le that decreases exponentially fast with increasing distance from the drive coil\nare currently being performed.\n\n3.3\n\nSimulation 1: Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-Directional Power CircuitPlasma Coupling, Li Propellant\n\nUni-directional coupling means the power circuit acts on the plasma, but does not receive\nany feedback from the plasma. This coupling is de\xef\xac\x81ned by setting Vplasma = 0 in the\npower circuit equations. This simulation is performed to allow comparison of results for unidirectional and bi-directional coupling. As expected, there are major di\xef\xac\x80erences, emphasizing\nthe importance of using a bi-directional power circuit-plasma coupling algorithm.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the circuit current Icir (t) and plasma voltage Vplasma (t) for a run\nlasting 50\xc2\xb5 sec. Icir shows oscillations with a period \xe2\x88\xbc 5.9\xc2\xb5 sec, which is the natural\nfrequency \xcf\x89 of the LRC circuit. For the chosen values of L, R, and C, \xcf\x89 \xe2\x88\xbc (LC)\xe2\x88\x921/2.\nThe magnitude of the current rises from zero to 2.65 \xc3\x97 105 A in the \xef\xac\x81rst quarter cycle\nas expected. It decreases by \xe2\x88\xbc 18% between successive peaks due to the circuit\xe2\x80\x99s resistance.\nBr reaches a maximum value of 250 G at the drive coil. As shown by the next example in\n\xc2\xa73.4, this dissipation rate substantially increases when the power circuit-plasma coupling is\nbi-directional. Vplasma is periodic at approximately the same frequency as the power circuit.\nIt rises to \xe2\x88\xbc 2200 V which is more than one order of magnitude below the initial capacitor\nvoltage of 30 kV. This relatively small value of Vplasma is attributed to the relatively small\npower circuit-plasma coupling area of 9.5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923 m2, which is the area of the drive coil,\ncompared to a coupling area \xe2\x88\xbc 0.66 m2 for the TRW PIT drive coil.\nFigures 6, 7, and 8 show the electron density at three successive times.

The large value of Vz near the inlet at later times is a result\nof the power circuit continuing to drive the plasma3 . The pro\xef\xac\x81les show plasma compression\nand acceleration from the drive coil to the exit on the far right. The maximum Isp for this\nsimulation is 3400 sec.\n3\nSubsequent simulations show that using a su\xef\xac\x83ciently large drive coil radius causes almost all of the\nenergy of the power circuit to be transferred to the plasma in approximately one oscillation of the circuit\ncurrent.\n\n13\n\n12\n\nFigure 8: Electron number density (m\xe2\x88\x923) at t = 45 \xc2\xb5 sec; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\nFigure 9: Total number density (m\xe2\x88\x923 ) at t = 6.9 \xc2\xb5 seconds;Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\n14\n\n13\n\nFigure 10: Total number density (m\xe2\x88\x923 ) at t = 25 \xc2\xb5 seconds;Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\nFigure 11: Total number density (m\xe2\x88\x923 ) at t = 45 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\n15\n\n14\n\nFigure 12: Axial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921 ) at t = 6.9 \xc2\xb5 seconds;Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\nFigure 13: Axial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921 ) at t = 25 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\n16\n\n15\n\nFigure 14: Axial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921 ) at t = 45 \xc2\xb5 seconds;Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\nFigure 15: Radial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921 ) at 6.9 \xc2\xb5 seconds;Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\n17\n\n16\n\nFigure 16: Radial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921 ) at t = 25 \xc2\xb5 seconds;Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\nFigure 17: Radial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921) at t = 45 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Uni-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\n18\n\n17\n\n3.4\n\nSimulation 2: Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Bi-Directional Power CircuitPlasma Coupling, Li Propellant\n\nThis simulation di\xef\xac\x80ers from Simulation 1 only in that there is now bi-directional coupling\nbetween the power circuit and the plasma. Figures 18 and 19 show Icir (t) and Vplasma (t) for\na period of 50 \xc2\xb5 seconds. A comparison of Fig. 4 and Fig. 18 shows a signi\xef\xac\x81cantly larger\ndamping rate for the case of bi-directional coupling. The current in Fig. 4 decreases by\n\xe2\x88\xbc 18% per period. The current in Fig. 18 decreases by 30 \xe2\x88\x92 40% during each successive\noscillation. The oscillation frequency for Icir is essentially equal to the natural frequency \xcf\x89\nof the power circuit. Since \xcf\x89 \xe2\x88\xbc (LC)\xe2\x88\x921/2 for the chosen values of L, R, and C, this implies\nthat the inductive coupling between the power circuit and the plasma is not signi\xef\xac\x81cant.\nIn reality, this coupling can be signi\xef\xac\x81cant. It is conjectured that the lack of inductive\ncoupling in this simulation, and in the other simulations discussed below, is mainly due to\ntwo factors. The \xef\xac\x81rst is the unrealistic feature of the simulation that the propellant \xef\xac\x81lls\nthe entire computational volume, instead of the initial propellant distribution being a thin\nlayer of gas on the drive coil. The second factor is that the mutual inductance between the\nplasma and the power circuit is expected to be proportional to the coupling area, which is\nthe area of the drive coil. Then the coupling is \xe2\x88\x9d R2 . The maximum value of Rd used in the\nd\nsimulations is 13.75 cm. It may be that this value is not large enough to cause signi\xef\xac\x81cant\ninductive coupling. Simulations are currently being performed to resolve this issue.\n\nFigure 18: Power circuit current (A) vs. t (sec).

The maximum Isp achieved for this simulation is 2500 seconds.\nThis value is signi\xef\xac\x81cantly smaller than the corresponding value of 3400 seconds for Simulation 1. This reduction in the maximum value of Isp, and the increase in the dissipation rate\nof the current in the power circuit over its value for Simulation 1 is believed to be due to the\nfact that, for bi-directional coupling, electrical energy in the plasma can be dissipated by the\nresistance of the power circuit, as well as by the plasma\xe2\x80\x99s own resistance. When the coupling\nis uni-directional, plasma electrical energy can only be dissipated by the plasma\xe2\x80\x99s resistance.\nBi-directional coupling opens up a new channel for the resistive dissipation of plasma electrical energy, resulting in more energy being thermalized, and less being converted into bulk\n\xef\xac\x82ow kinetic energy, leading to a lower Isp.\n\nFigure 23: Total number density (m\xe2\x88\x923 ) at t = 6.9 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Bi-directional\nCoupling; r-z in meters.\n\nFigure 24: Total number density (m\xe2\x88\x923 ) at t = 25 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Bi-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\n22\n\n21\n\nFigure 25: Total number density (m\xe2\x88\x923 ) at t = 45 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Bi-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\nFigure 26: Axial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921 ) at t = 6.9 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Bi-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\n23\n\n22\n\nFigure 27: Axial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921 ) at t = 25 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Bi-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\nFigure 28: Axial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921 ) at t = 45 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Bi-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\n24\n\n23\n\nFigure 29: Radial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921 ) at t = 6.9 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Bi-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\nFigure 30: Radial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921) at t = 25 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Bi-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\n25\n\n24\n\nFigure 31: Radial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921) at t = 45 \xc2\xb5 seconds; Rcoil = 5.5 cm, Bi-directional\nCoupling, Li Propellant; r-z in meters.\n\n3.5\n\nSimulation 3: Rcoil = 13.75 cm, Bi-Directional Power CircuitPlasma Coupling, Li Propellant\n\nHere the drive coil-plasma coupling area is increased by a factor of 6.25 over that for Simulation 2. Icir (t) and Vplasma (t) are shown in \xef\xac\x81gures 32 and 33. A comparison of \xef\xac\x81gure\n32 with \xef\xac\x81gure 18 shows that the current damps at about the same rate as for Simulation 2.\nThis is believed to be mainly due to the result of the unrealistic assumption of a constant\ndrive coil resistance R. Since the area of the drive coil is increased by the factor 6.25 over\nthat in Simulation 2, the resistance should increase by approximately the same factor. This\nis expected to increase the current damping rate by about the same factor. A comparison\nof \xef\xac\x81gure 33 with \xef\xac\x81gure 19 shows that Vplasma decreases more rapidly than for Simulation 2.\nThis is believed to be due to the larger coupling area allowing for more rapid dissipation of\nplasma electrical energy by the power circuit resistance.\nFigures 34, 35, and 36 show the total density at three successive times.\n\n26\n\n25\n\nFigure 32: Circuit current (A) vs. t (sec).

The duration of this\nsimulation is 75 \xc2\xb5 seconds. The increase in runtime over that of Simulation 2 is necessary to\nfully resolve the plasma dynamics since the axial velocity is much smaller than for Simulation\n2. This decrease in axial \xef\xac\x82ow velocity is believed to be due to the greater dissipation rate\nof plasma electrical energy by the resistance R of the power circuit, thereby decreasing\nthe energy available for propellant acceleration. This is a consequence of the bi-directional\ncoupling of the power circuit and plasma allowing plasma electrical energy to be dissipated\nby the circuit resistance as well as by the plasma resistance.

The masses of Ar and Li are 39.948 amu and 6.94 amu. The di\xef\xac\x80erence between the Li\nand Ar cases enters the model through the mass density, and equation of state.\nFigures 46 and 47 show Icir (t) and Vplasma (t). Comparison of these \xef\xac\x81gures with \xef\xac\x81gures 32\nand 33 for Simulation 3 show that all pro\xef\xac\x81les oscillate with a period essentially equal to\nthe natural frequency \xcf\x89 \xe2\x88\xbc 5.9\xc2\xb5 sec of the power circuit, but that the amplitude of Icir is\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cantly larger for the case of Ar. As for Simulation 2, the fact that the oscillation\nfrequency is \xcf\x89, which is \xe2\x88\xbc (LC)\xe2\x88\x921/2, indicates there is no signi\xef\xac\x81cant inductive coupling\nbetween the plasma and the power circuit for these simulations. The result that the damping\nrate for Icir is smaller in the case of Ar than in the case of Li is due to the fact that\nrelatively little work is done by the Lorentz force on the plasma during the simulation with\nAr compared with that done during the simulation with Li. For a given axial Lorentz force\nFz , the acceleration of Ar is less than that of Li by roughly the mass ratio. The power\napplied by the power circuit to accelerate the plasma is \xe2\x88\xbc Fz Vz , which is smaller for Ar than\nfor Li due to the smaller value of Vz .\nFor given Fz , the ratio of the maximum values of Isp for the Li and Ar cases should be\napproximately equal to the inverse ratio of their masses. The maximum value of Isp for this\nsimulation, obtained from \xef\xac\x81gure 50, is 140 seconds. Then these ratios are 4.43 and 5.64.\nAs a result of the increase in mass of the propellant, the plasma only moves a distance\n\xe2\x88\xbc 0.2 m during the 75 \xc2\xb5 sec duration of the simulation.\n\nFigure 46: Circuit current (A) vs. t (sec).

These modi\xef\xac\x81cations\nare the \xef\xac\x81rst in a series of modi\xef\xac\x81cations to generalize PCAPPS to a complete 2.5 D simulation\ntool for cylindrically symmetric PPA\xe2\x80\x99s, and similar pulsed power devices.\nAn accurate algorithm for modeling power circuit-plasma coupling in PPA simulations\nis necessary for the simulation to be useful for designing, optimizing, and predicting the op36\n\n35\n\nFigure 50: Axial velocity (m \xe2\x88\x92 sec\xe2\x88\x921 ) at t = 75 \xc2\xb5 seconds.

Previous power circuit-plasma coupling algorithms are uni-directional or\nrepresent the plasma as a circuit coupled to the power circuit through a mutual inductance.\nFor the PPA project, ISR conceived and implemented a self consistent, general, \xef\xac\x81rst principles based power circuit-plasma coupling algorithm. This algorithm appears to be new.\nThe implementation was done using an L, R, C power circuit, and the Ohm\xe2\x80\x99s law in the\noriginal version of PCAPPS. However, the algorithm is easily implemented for an arbitrary\npower circuit and Ohm\xe2\x80\x99s law. For a power circuit that is not easily represented as a set\nof di\xef\xac\x80erential equations that may be solved analytically or numerically, a general circuit\nmodeling tool such as PSPICE may be used to solve for the drive coil current that provides\nthe required boundary condition for PCAPPS. PCAPPS then provides an updated voltage\nacross the drive coil due to the plasma electric \xef\xac\x81eld. This voltage drop is represented as an\nEMF in series with the drive coil resistance and inductance in the power circuit, allowing\nPSPICE to compute an updated drive coil current. Changing the Ohm\xe2\x80\x99s law in PCAPPS\nsimply changes the algebraic equation for the plasma electric \xef\xac\x81eld.\nSince the end of the PPA project reported on here, PCAPPS was further modi\xef\xac\x81ed in\ntwo important ways. The \xef\xac\x81rst was to expand the drive coil area to cover the entire area\nof the computational boundary at the back wall z = 0. This provides a more accurate\nrepresentation of the geometry of real PPA\xe2\x80\x99s The second modi\xef\xac\x81cation was to implement\na realistic initial propellant density pro\xef\xac\x81le, modeled as a density distribution that falls o\xef\xac\x80\nexponentially with increasing distance from the drive coil. Simulation results incorporating\nthese modi\xef\xac\x81cations will be reported during the current phase of the project in 2006 - 2007.\nAcknowledgments\nThe ISR team thanks Professor Edgar Choueiri of the Princeton University Department of\nMechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and Dr. Kamesh Sankaran of the Whitworth College\nDepartment of Physics for providing ISR with the original version of PCAPPS.\n\n38\n\n37\n\nReferences\n[1] Sankaran, K., MS thesis, Princeton University Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,\nJan 2001.\n\n[2] Sankaran, K., Ph.D. thesis, Princeton University Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Jan 2005.\n\n[3] Choueiri, E.

ABSTRACT\n\nThis report presents the main results of the modeling task of the PPA project. The objective of this task is to make\nmajor progress towards developing a new computational tool with new capabilities for simulating cylindrically symmetric 2.5 dimensional (2.5 D) PPA\xe2\x80\x99s. This tool may be used for designing, optimizing, and understanding the operation of PPA\xe2\x80\x99s and other pulsed power devices. The foundation for this task is the 2-D, cylindrically symmetric, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code PCAPPS (Princeton Code for Advanced Plasma Propulsion Simulation). PCAPPS\nwas originally developed by Sankaran (2001, 2005) to model Lithium Lorentz Force Accelerators (LLFA\xe2\x80\x99s), which\nare eletrode based devices, and are typically operated in continuous magnetic field to the model, and implementing a\nfirst principles, self-consistent algorithm to couple the plasma and power circuit that drives the plasma dynamics.\n15.
