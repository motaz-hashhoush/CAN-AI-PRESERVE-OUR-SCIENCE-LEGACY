sky.\n\nNevertheless, because of its location close to the\n\nOrion Nebula region, it has received less attention than other important\nobjects.\n\nHarper (1974) presented the first far-infrared map of the\n\nsource, obtained at low angular resolution (51).\n\nAbout the same time\n\nGrasdalen (1974) reported detailed near- and mid-infrared observations,\ndiscovered a bright infrared pOint source (IRS 2), and suggested that it\nwas the exciting star for the object.\nthe object at 400\n\nllm\n\nHudson and Soifer (1976) mapped\n\nand compared their results with existing\n\nfar-infrared continuum and millimeter-wave molecular data.\n\nOther\n\ninfrared observations of note are the near-infrared spectroscopy of IRS\n1 and IRS 2 by Thompson, Thronson, and Campbell (1981), who investigated\nthe excitation and structure of the source and concluded that the\ndominant exciting star had yet to be identified.\n\nMore recently, Black\n\nand Willner (1983) discussed high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy\nof IRS 2, emphasizing the line-of-sight CO absorption and the nature of\nthe infrared source.\n\nIn addition Frey et\n\n.!h\n\n(1979) presented\n\nnear-infrared continuum maps and also argued for multiple sources of\nexc ita t ion.\nDetailed high-resolution radio continuum observations of NGC 2024\nare not common.\n\nAn 11 cm map has been presented by Turner et\n\n~\n\n(1974), as well as useful single-dish measurements by Rodriguez and\nChaisson (1978), Lobert and Goss (1978), Krugel\n\net_~\n\n(1982), and\n\nBieging, Wilson, and Downes (1982).\nElaborate radio molecular observations of NGC 2024 are also fairly\nrare.\n\nBieging, \\4i1 son, and Downes presented H CO absorption in the\n2\n\n-4-\n\nobject and an HCN map credited to Gilmore\nand Soifer.\n\nRecently,

mapped both\n\nby scanning and with position-by-position integrations.\nThe source Has mapped in four filters:\n\nthree narrow-band filters,\n\nhav ing effect ive wavel engths at 40 lJ m, 60lJm, and 100 lJm, and a\nlong-wavelength pass fil ter with a cut-on at 140 lJm.\n\nThe 100 lJm\n\nobservations were obtained at full-beam spacing, but the other three\nemployed one-half- or one-third-beam spacing, except in the regions of\nthe lowest contours.\n\nAn area roughly 6\' square, centered on the peak of\n\nthe 60 lJm emission, was mapped in all filters, except for the 40pm\nfilter where an area roughly 4\' square was mapped.\n\nAs will be discussed\n\nbelow, some far-infrared mapping extended further north-south.\n\nThe\n\nresults are presented in Fig. 1.\nIn

the maps is \xc2\xb1 0.01-0.02 (10 rms) of the peak.\n\nTherefore, the\n\ntotal uncertainty of the quoted flux densities (Table 1 and below) is\ndominated by external (mainly calibration) uncertainties.\nexperience we believe this to be about \xc2\xb1 20%, or less.\npositional accuracy of the maps are \xc2\xb1 15"\n\nFran past\n\nThe absolute\n\n(20 rms).\n\nConversion of broadband fluxes to flux densities was accomplished\nin an iterative manner similar to that described in Thronson and Harper\n(1979) or Smith\n\n!:.~ ~h\n\n(1982).\n\nPeak flux densities, as well as the\n\ntotal flux densities, are presented in Table 1.\n\nIn a 49" beam the peak\n\nvalues are 30-40% larger than those reported by Thronson\nat the same resolution.\n\n~ ~\n\n(1978)\n\nAs judged by the maps in Fig. 1, this\nI\n\ndifference is almost certainly due to the small (2.4) chopper throw used\nin the ea rl ier observation s.\n\nThe total flux densities in Table 1 are\n\n1n fa ir

approximation to the\n\ntemperature of the dust, T , that dominates the far-infrared emission.\nd\nFor positions removed from the peak, the same functional fonn was\n~?_sumed\n\nto characterize the spectrum, so that Td could be found from\n\nobservations made with only two or three filters. The temperature\nstructure in the source is discussed in \xc2\xa7 III and presented in Fig. 4.\nThe infrared luminosity (10)1m-200)1m) of the area mapped in Fig. 1\nwas 4 x 10 4 L at a distance of 0.5 kpc, in agreement with that found by\n8\n\nHarper (1974) using a large 51 beam. This is equivalent to the total\nluminosity of an 09 zero age main sequence\ndiscussed\n\nbelov~,\n\n(ZAl~S)\n\nstar.\n\nAs will be\n\nthis luminosity is significantly larger than available\n\nfrom the two vJell-studied embedded stars (IRS 1 and 2).\n\n-7b.}\n\nThe Radio Molecular Observations\n\nObservations of emission fran molecules sensitive to high densities\nwere made during January, 1981 using the 11 m telescope of NRA0 6 at Kitt\nPeak.\n\nThe 97.98 GHz J\n\n=\n\n2 -+ 1 1 ine of CS was mapped in NGC 2024 at l\'\n\nspac ing sus i ng a 128\xc2\xb7-channe 1 spectrometer with 100 and 250 kHz\n\n6The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is operated by Associated\nUniversities, Inc., under contract to the National Science Foundation.\n\nresolution.\n\nThe 88.63 GHz J\n\n= 1 -+ 0 1 ine of HCN was similarly mapped.\n\nThe angular resolution of the telescope at these two frequencies was\n\n,\n\nabout 1.3.\n\nAbsolute calibration for both objects was obtained primarily\n\n*\nby using Ori A, for which we took TA\n\n= 8.4\n\n*\nK for CS and TA\n\n= 17.2\n\nK for\n\nthe J = 1-+ 0, F = 2 -+ 1 1 ine of HCN. Since Ori A was so close in the\nsky to NGC 2024, corrections for airmass opacity \\\'/ere small.\n\nThe\n\ninternal uncertainties in the observations of both molecular species are\nabout 1 a\n\n= 0.3\n\n- 0.5 K for anyone position.\n\nThe pointing uncertainty\n\nof the 11m telescope was found to be less than\n\n\xc2\xb1\n\n15".\n\nThe maps of the\n\nemission from for both molecular species are presented in Fig. 3a-b as\n\n*\nthe maximum TA for the line at each position.\n\nThis should be close to\n\ntotal line strength since the line width did not vary much throughout\nthe\n\nsource.\n\nThe\n\nvelocity\n\nstructure,\n\nas\n\nrevealed by these\n\nhigh-dipole-moment molecules, is discussed in \xc2\xa7IIIb.\nOne of the goals of this millimeter mapping program was to\ndetermine the HCN hyperfine ratios as a function of position in the\nsource.\n\nThis might then be used as a measure of the variations in\n\n-8-\n\nmolecular abundances and column densities in the object.\n\nIn NGC 2024 we\n\nfound the average hyperfine 1 ines to appear in the ratio 1:0.5:0.2\n\n*\n[TA(J\n\n*\n= 12 ~ 0l):T * (J(11 ~ 0 ): TA(J =\n0 1)], This is\nA\nF\n1\nF\nindistinguishible fran the optically thin extreme.

Note also that the higher far-infrared\ncontours encompass the radio continuum peaks (Schraml and Mezger 1969,\nTurner\n\nn\n\n~]~ 1974, KrUgel et ~h 1982).\n\nWe therefore suggest that the\n\nmost likely location for an exciting star is in the general direction of\nthe 60\n\nllm\n\nmaximum.\n\nThis position is significantly offset from the two\n\nbright near-infrared sources, IRS 1 and IRS 2, which would mean that\nneither dominates the excitation of the region (see also Balick 1976;\nFrey ~t .~J~ 1979; Thompson, Thronson, and Campbell 1981; and Krugel et\n~).\n\nThis picture is further supported by the apparently small effect\n\nthat the two objects have upon even the lower far-infrared contours and\ndu st tempera tu re (Fig. 4 and next sect ion).\nAt longer far-infrared wavelengths (Fig. Id) and at sub-mill imeter\nwavelengths (Hudson and Soifer 1976), the appearance of NGC 2024 changes\nto a more north-south elongation.\n\nThis change at the various\n\nwavelengths is probably due to the influence of different parameters at\nthe various Wlvelengths.\nand\n\nIV\n\nAt far infrared wavelengths between\n\nIV\n\n40 11m\n\n100 11m, for example the emission depends very sensitively upon\n\ntemperature, but only modestly upon emission optical depth (i.e., column\ndensity of wann dust).\n\nLonger wavelengths ---\n\n>15011m\n\nIV\n\n-- are usually\n\n-10-\n\n011\n\nthe Rayleigh-Jeans side of the source spectrum, and the emission is\n\nmuch less sensitive to variations in dust temperature. Column density\nvariations therefore become proportionately more influential.\n\nModel\n\ninfrared sources show this effect clearly (e.g., Leung 1976, Natta and\nPanagia 1976; Rowan-Robinson 1979, 1980). On the basis of our\nobservations then, NGC 2024 is dominated by a wann high column density\nridge, elongated primarily in the north-south direction, toward which\nare found the exciting stars.\n\nUnfortunately our 200 ]Jm observations\n\nare not complete enough to confirm this north-south extent.\nThe total far-infrared luminosity of the NGC 2024 infrared source\nis close to that of an 09 ZAMS star, or an ensemble of stars of\nequivalent luminosity.\n\nThe same conclusion was reached by calculating\n\nthe ionizing flux necessary to power the radio continuum source (Kriigel\n~ ~\n\n1982). This suggests that there is very 1 ittle dust mixed with\n\nthe ionized gas in the source,\n\nwhich is usually the case for H II\nregions of only low to moderate densities (i.e., nH ~ 104 cm- 3 ). The\ncompact or ultra-compact H II regions, on the other hand, almost\ninvariably appear to have dust vllthin the ionized zone, resulting in a\nsignificant reduction of the ionizing flux (e.g., Thronson and Harper\n1979; Habing and Israel 1979).\n\nThe identification of a late O/early B\n\nstar as the ultimate power source is also in agreement with the low He/H\nratio derived from radio recombination lines (Cesarsky 1977, Churchwell\n~ ~\n\n1978, KrUgel ~.~).\n\nIf IRS 2 is a BO.5 ZAMS star, as suggested by Thompson, Thronson,\nand Campbell\n\n(1981),\n\nit should make "no more than about a 20%\n\ncontribution to the total luminosity and ionizing flux of the region.\nThis is consistent with our conclusions drawn from the appearance of the\n\n-121981. Black and Willner 1983).\n\nThis is consistent with gas heating via\n\nthenna1 coup1 ing with the du st under conditions of at least modestly\nhigh densities (n ~ 10 5 cm- 3 , from the results of Goldsmith and Langer\nH\n2\n1978; see a1 so Snell ~t.1!J-.!.. 1983).\nOnly directly south of the peak does Td change rapidly.\nsouth, Td\n\n~\n\n35 K, and two arcmin south, Td\n\n~\n\n40 K as far as two arcmin north of the peak.\n\n25 K.\n\nOne arcmin\n\nBy contrast, Td :t\n\nEast and west of the\n\ncentral position, Td changes only very 1 ittle, by a few degrees.\n\nIRS 1\n\nand IRS 2 may contribute to the maintaining of high temperature in these\ndirections.\n\nThere is a hot spot\n\ndensity peak where Td\n\n=\n\n1~\n\narcmin to the east of the flux\n\n58 K, but all the pOints surrounding this\n\nposition are around 53 K.\n\nThe most striking feature of Fig. 4 is\n\ntherefore the very abrupt drop in dust temperature directly south of the\n60 pm maximum.\n\nEmission at the shorter wavelengths of Fig. 1,\n\nparticularly at 40pm, are well on the Wien side of the dust emission in\nthis region.\n\nThe emission is quite weak, compared to the rest of the\n\nsource and the object therefore appears broader in the east-west\ndirect ion.\nThis temperature distribution is characteristic of exciting stars\nthat are abutting a very dense molecular cloud at which we are looking\nln cross- sect ion.\n\nIn the ca se of NGC 2024 a dense pa rt of the cloud\n\nlies just to the south of the infrared and radio continuum peaks.\n\nRapid\n\nabsorption of photons causes the dust temperature to drop very sharply\nover a di stance of only one arcminute.\n\nE1 sewhere the tempera ture\n\ngradient is quite gentle, which suggests that any extinction of photons\nin other directions is more modest.\n\n-13-\n\nThis general\n\ndescription\n\nobservations (KrUgel\n\n~!~;\n\nis\n\nsupported\n\nby radio continuum\n\nJ. Bieging, private communication) which\n\nshoVI very steep contou rs a t the sou th edge of the H I I reg ion.\n\nHere the\n\nionizing photons are being very suddenly absorbed.\nOu r interpreta t ion of the du st temperatu re map is in agreement with\nthe 8.7lJm map presented by Grasdalen.\n\nIts maximum is I\' south of IRS 2\n\nand the emission is elongated east-west.\n\nBecause mid-infrared emission\n\nshould show the distribution of the hottest material, it is reasonable\nthat the dominant exciting stars are close to the position of the 8.7 lJm\nmax im lH:l.\n\niii.\n\nFar-infrared Optical Depth\nWith a temperature known, the 60 lJm emission optical depth (T 60)\n\ncan be found frcm the flux density using Fv\nthe beam solid angle.\n\nJv(T d ) St, where St is\n6\nThe 60 lJm optical depth was thereby mapped in NGC\n\n2024 and is presented in Fig. 5.\npreceding\n\nt~uch\n\n=\n\nT\n\nof the discussion in the\n\ntwo sections can now be quantified.\n\nAt far-infrared\n\nwavelengths tlGC 2024 is very bright, which implies that the emission\noptical depth is large.\n\nUsing the method described in \xc2\xa7 IIa we found\n\nthe 60 lJ m optical depth to be T60\n\n=\n\n0.3 at the peak.\n\nDue to the\n\nsimplifying assumptions necessary for the calculation, this value is\nprobably uncerta in by a factor of at least 3.\n\nNevertheless, a high\n\noptical depth is also supported by observations (Lemke and Low 1972)\nthat suggest optically thick mid-infrared emission and by an optical\ndepth at 400 lJm (Hudson and Soifer 1976) in agreement with that found\nhere, if extrapolated using reasonable assumptions.\nThis is fairly high for an optical depth at 60 lJm, and is matched\nby similarly high values throughout the rest of the cloud.\n\nFig. 5 is a\n\ncontour map of T60 , each point calculated as for the peak.\n\nAlthough the\n\n-14uncerta inty in the absolute values for T60 is large, the relative\nuncertainties are much lower and the figure should be a good\nrepresentation of the distribution of far-infrared-emitting dust.\n\nIt is\n\nnot unusual to find the maximum optical depth toward the location of the\nexciting stars.\n\nHowever, this maximum does not falloff rapidly in\n\neither the north or south direction.\n\nThe figure graphically shows that\n\nthe core of NGC 2024 is dominated by an extended high-column-density\nridge.\n\nThis north-south extent is consistent with the visual appearance\n\nof NGC 2024 (c.f., Grasdalen, 1974, Balick 1976, Fig. 2).\n\nThis\n\nmorphology was predicted by the behavior of 160]Jm emission which was\nmore heavily influenced by tile column density of dust than was emission\nat shorter wavelengths.\nThe far-infrared optical depth can be converted to a visual\nextinction, sinceT 60 ~ 0.003 AV (Gatley ~ ~ 1977; Rowan-Robinson\n1979; Keene 1981). Therefore, AV ~ 100 mag at the far-infrared peak,\ndropping to AV\n\n~\n\n15 mags at the outer edges of the core.\n\nIt is worth\n\nemphasizing that the far-infrared optical depth contours do not show any\nsignificant effect due to the presence of IRS 1 or 2.\nOn the basis of molecular observations discussed in the following\nsections, we are going to argue that the bulk of the dust is foreground\nto the ionized gas and exciting stars.\n\nIn the direction of IRS 2, our\n\nfar-infrared optical depth suggests a visual extinction close to 50\nmags. For this object Thompson, Thronson, and Campbell (1981) found only\nAV\n\n= 12\n\n\xc2\xb1\n\n3 mags from the Brackett 1 ine series. Although there are\n\nsignificant systematic uncerta inties in T60\' we consider this difference\nto be real and suggest that IRS 2 is buried only part way into the NGC\n2024 cloud as we view it from Earth.\n\nUnder these conditions it appears\n\n-15-\n\nbrighter in the near-infrared than would more luminous stars located at\nthe fa r- infrared/radio continuum peak and woul d thereby attract more\nattention.\n\nFor example, on the basis of Fig. 5, a BO.5 ZPMS star like\n\nIRS 2 (Thompson et\nmoved\n\nto\n\nthe\n\n~~~)\n\nwould appear\n\ncen ter of\n\n~ magnitud~~\n\nthe H II\n\nreg ion\n\nand\n\nfainter at lKJ if\nbeh ind\n\nthe\n\nfar-infrared-emitting dust.\nThe various observations of NGC 2024 allow a calculation of the\nmass of the molecular cloud mapped here.\n\nA number of authors have\n\nderived relations between molecular column density and far-infrared\n. optical depth (c.f., Evans, Blair, and Beckwith 1977; Righini-Cohen and\nSimon 1977; Sargent\nThronson et\n\n~l~\n\n~~ ~~\n\n1981; Keene, Hildebrand, and Whitcomb 1982;\n\n1983; \xc2\xa7IIIbii).\n\nBecause of the similarity of\n\nassumptions, \\\'Ie adopt the relation found by Thronson ~~~, T60 = 6 x\n10- 19 N(13 CO ); except for the results in Righini-Cohen and Simon, the\nother studies give similar values. Therefore, toward the center of NGC\n2024, N( 13CO ) ~ 5 x 10 17 cm- 2 , or N(H ) ~2 x 10 23 , if l13COJ/lH2J = 3 x\n2\n6 (see also Black and Willner l1983J and \xc2\xa7IIIbii). The same data may\n10be used to estimate the total mass of the region mapped in the\nfar-infrared.

Therefore Fig. 3 suggests that the high\ncolumn density ridge in Fig. 5 is due mainly to a high volume density.\nThe core of UGC 2024 is dominated by a dense, centrally-located,\ncylinder-like region.\nThe\nprovisos.\n\npreceding discussion\n\nincludes at least two significant\n\nThe first is the role of optical depth in molecular emission.\n\nModels (Gottlieb\n\n~t~.1975;\n\nKwan and Scoville 1975) suggest that the\n\nemission from HCN is more susceptible to compl icated radiative transfer\neffects than is the CS emission.\n\nQuantitative estimates of this effect\n\npresumably await detailed observations of higher level transitions, but\n1t seems a resonable explanation for the apparent differences in\n\nstructure between Figs. 3a and 3b.\nAn additional consideration that probably affects the CS molecule\nmore is that of radiatiVe excitation.\n\nThis is probably a minor\n\nconsideration in NGC 2024 since the source is so extended and of only\nmodest luminosity.\n\nThis effect has been considered for NGC 2024 by\n\nSnell et al.\nThe velocity distribution in NGC 2024 shows a very interesting\nstructure.\n\nHere we consider the V\nat the 1 ine maximum of the J ::: 1-+\nLSR\n0, F ::: 2 -+ 1 1 ine of HCN, since it was usually observed at higher\nspectral resolution (0.33 kin s -1 ) than was CS.\n\nAs with all strong radio\n\nmolecular emission observed from NGC 2024 (e.g., Thompson, Thronson, and\nCampbell 1981), the 1 ine center VLSR is within 1 kin 5- 1 of +10 kin s-1\nthroughout the region mapped. However, just as a central ridge has been\nrevealed by column and volume density tracers, so does the HCN velocity\nshow a characteristic ridge.\n\nA north-south cut through the peak of NGC\n\n2024 --- along the high-density core --- has V\n::: 10.5 \xc2\xb1 0.2 kin s-1\nLSR\n\n-18-\n\nThere is no evidence for a north-to-south gradient greater than about\n0.3 I<m s-1 over the region mapped.\n\nHowever, one angular resolution\n\nelement either to the west or east of this ridge, V\nLSR = 10.0 \xc2\xb1 0.2 km\ns-1. Another resolution element in ~ither direction and there is a\nfurther decrease to V\n= 9.5 \xc2\xb1 0.3 km s-1. The central ridge therefore\nLSR\nappears to be moving away from the surrounding parts of the cloud at ~ 1\n-1\n\nkm s\n\n.\n\nThe high-density velocity structure should be compared with that\nfound for other components in NGC 2024 as this will be important\n~vidence\n\nfor the model described in the following section.\n\nto be two velocity components in the object.\n\nThere appear\n\nAs already noted, all\n\nstroll9. molecular emission and absorption have V\nLSR = 9-10 km s-1\n(Thompson, Thronson, and Campbell; Bieging ~~ 1982). This velocity\nis al so close to tha t of the strongest H I absorpt ion (Lockhart and Goss\n1978) and C II emission (Wil son ~ ~ 1975, Krugel et ~ 1982).\nHowever, the strongest ionized H and He emission is found at 5-7 km s-1\n(Krugel et ~), along with weaker CO emission. Since different\nvelocities may refer to different locations in space, these observations\nbear directly upon the structure of NGC 2024.\n\n1~.\n\nMolecular Abundances and Column Densities\nCertain lIseful relations can be derived using the improved radio\n\nand infrared data presented here as well as results from the literature.\nWe are first interested in estimating the column densities of the two\nmolecules observed here and comparing the result with the 60\noptical depth.\n\n~m\n\nemission\n\nThe following analysis implicitly assumes that the\n\nfar-infrared emission is co-extensive with that of the molecules.\n\n-19-\n\nDetailed radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium models are\nrequired to fully analyze the\n\nHCN and CS emission (e.g., Snell et2.L).\n\nBecause we are satisfied with order-of-magnitude estimates, we shall\ninstead adopt the assumption of thermodynamic equil ibrium so that the\nmolecular column density may be specified by a single excitation\ntempera tu re.\n\nFor CS we use\n\nN(CS)\n\n~here\n\n12\nx 10 1CS Tex {CS)6V\n1 - exp(-7.1/T ex (CS))\n\n= 1.9\n\n1CS is the optical depth of the J\n\n=2\n\n-+\n\n1\n\nline, Tex is the\n\nmolecule\'s excitation temperature, and 6v is the linewidth in NGC 2024\n(3.5\n\nIqn\n\ns -1 ).\n\nUnder the fairly high density conditions of the core of\n\nNGC 2024, it is likely that Tex(CS)\n\n::t Tk = 45 K and that 1CS\n\n-+\n\n1.\n\nIn\n\nany case, these particular values serve as upper limits for the above\n15\nequation. We therefore estimate N(CS) \'::: 2 x 10\ncm- 2 ; hence, N(CS) :: 6\n2\nx 10 15 160 cm- . Snell ~~ (1983) estimated the CS column density\nln NGC 2024 using a multi-level mode1. They calculated N(CS) = 1.6 x\n10 14 em -2 towa rd the infrared/mol ecu 1ar max imum. Thi s result\' gives\nN{CS) = 5 x 10 14 T , in agreement with the limit from our data.\n60\nThe HCN molecule is more difficult to analyze - - - even in the\nsimple manner adopted here - - because of significant ambiguities in\nthe transfer of its radiation through a dense molecular cloud.\n~!~\n\n(1975)\n\nGottlieb\n\nwere able to fit observed HCN hyperfine line ratios with\n\na farily stra ightforwa rd model of optica lly-thin em; ss;on.\n\nKwan and\n\nScoville (1975) argue instead that significant radiation trapping can\nalter the molecule\'s level\n\npopulations and thereby dupl icate the\n\nappearance of optically-thin emission.\n\nHowever, we note that in the\n\n-20-\n\n*\ncase of NGC 2024, TA(HCN) \xc2\xabT , as shown in Fig. 3b. According to the\nK\nmodels of Kwan and Scoville, the emission therefore has only modest\noptical depth under the high density conditions calculated for this\nobject.\n\nUnder these circumstances we can use the Gottlieb et al.\n\ncalculations to estimate the HCN column density. At the far-infrared\n\n*\n*\n*\npeak we have TA(J F = 12 -+ 01) = 7 K, TA(J F = 10 -+0 ) = 1.5 K, and TA(J\n1\nF\n= 11 -+ 0 ) = 3.1 K. On the basis of the velocity structure described\n1\nin the previous section, we shall take dv/dr\nGottl ieb\n\n~~,\n\ntherefore, we estimate N(HCN)\n6\nused nH = 1.6 x 10 cm- 3 from Snell et. .!h.\n13 T 2 -2\nio\n60 cm\n\n=\n\n1 km s-l pc-I.\n\n=1\n\nFrom\n\nx 10 13 cm -2 ,where we\n\nThis gives N(HCN)\n\n=3\n\nx\n\nColumn densities have been calculated for a number of other species\ntoward the NGC 2024.\n\nIn particular, Goss et.\n\n~\n\n(1976) calculated the\n\nOH abundance, Lockhart and Goss (1978) found the H I absorption, Genzel\n~\n\n2.]..:_ (1979) estimated both CH and H2CO column densities, Holl is and\n\nChurchwell (1983) studied HCO, and Black and Willner (l983) estimated\nthe amount of H2 and CO in front of IRS 2.\nthose\n\n~\n\nAll of these values, and\n\nestimated for HCN and CS, are collected in Table 2 where we\n\npresent the ratio of column density to 60jJm optical depth.\n\nWhere the\n\nbeam size of the radio observation significantly exceeded that of the\nfa r-infra red da ta - - - or where it referred to a position other than\nthe pea k - - corrections were made to the infrared optical depth.\nWe empha size aga in that the combined uncerta in ties of the radio and\nfar-infrared data mean that Table 2 can only be an order-of-magnitude\ntabulation.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that the relative abundances\n\n1n NGC 2024, as well as the ratios of molecular column densities to dust\noptical depth, are in general agreement with other work (e.g., the\nN(CO)/\'IR relations in Thronson et\n\n~\n\n1983).\n\n-21-\n\nc.}\n\nA Model\n\nThe observations presented here and elsewhere allow a model of NGC\n2024 to be created.\n\nWe first summarize our findings.\n\nNGC 2024 is dominated by a high density core\nnorth-south direction.\n\nelongated in the\n\nThe column density through the center of the\n\ncloud is equivalent to roughly 100 visual magnitudes of extinction.\n\nThe\n\npeak in far-infrared emission is cOincident with the maximum antenna\ntemperature of CS and HCN, and close to the radio continuum maximum.\nThe two bright near-infrared sources - IRS 1 and IRS 2 -probably combine\nto contribute less than about half of the total far-infrared luminosity\nof the source.\n\nAn additional exciting star awaits discovery and is most\n\nlikely located toward the radio/infrared maximum.\nIn many respects our description of NGC 2024 is in agreement with\nthe model\n\nsuggested by Krugel\n\n~~ ~l.:...\n\n(see their Fig. 7).\n\nThe H II\n\nregion lies behind the dense molecular cloud, as demonstrated by the\nH CO absorption studies (Bieging ~t. ~ 1982). The cause of the two\n2\nvelocity components is the acceleration of ionized gas away from a\ncavity in the cloud and in a direction somewhat toward the observer.\nOur modification to the Krligel\n\n~~ ~l.~\n\nmodel is as follows.\n\nFirst,\n\nas already noted, we find no evidence for IRS 2 playing a major role in\nsource excitation and we believe that this object is most likely\nembedded partway into the cloud core, as vie\\\'1ed from Earth (Krugel et\nal. were unable to satisfactorily detennine the role of IRS 2 in the\nsource.).\n\nSecond,\n\nthere seems to be very little evidence for a\n\nsignificant amount of molecular material on the backside (as viewed from\nEarth) of the H II region, except as might be necessary to confine the\nionized gas.\n\nVisual\n\nphotographs and radio continuum observations\n\n-22-\n\nsuggest tha t behind the dark bar 1ies a diffu se - not compact - H II\nregion, and our preference is therefore to minimize the amount of\nmolecular material that completely surrounds it.\nOn the basis of Fig. 2 we al so suggest that much of the visually\nbright material seen in NGC 2024 1 ies forward of the bul k of the\nmolecular material as vie\\IJed from earth.\n\nOur\n\n200~\n\nmap extends into\n\nthe region of strong visual emission, but it shows no rapid decrease at\nthese positions.\n\nThis means that the dust (and gas) 1 ikewise does not\n\ndecrease rapidly.\n\nThis is difficult to quantity, hO\\,/ever, since we have\n\nno dust temperature information in the outer parts of the cloud.\nWe note that this picture of 11GC 2024 is qualitatively similar to\nthat of the M42/BN-KL region, if the latter was turned 180 0 away from\nour line of sight. We suggest that if we were to view NGC 2024 from its\nbackside we would see a visually bright, diffuse H II region, excited by\na centrally located BO ZAMS star. Behind this ionized zone would lie a\nvery dense molecular cloud, within which is embedded a lower luminosity\nobject (IRS 2), offset,...., I\' from the most luminous star.\n\nExcept for\n\ndifferences in luminosity, and perhaps evolutionary stage, this is what\n1S\n\nfound in f142.\n\n-23-\n\nWe appreciate discussions and/or\n\ndata in advance of publ ication\n\nfrom Drs.

Abstract\n\nWe present new far-infrared continuum and millimeter-wave molecular observations of NGC 2024.\nThe measurements were obtained at relatively high angular resolution, enabling us to describe the\nsource energetics and mass distribution in greater detail than previously reported. The object\nappears to be dominated by a dense ridge of material, extended in the north-south direction and\ncentered on the dark lane that is seen in visual photographs. Our maps of the source using the\n"high-density" molecules CS and HCN confirm this picture and allow us to describe the core structure\nand molecular abundances. The radio molecular and infrared observations support the idea that an\nimportant exciting star in NGC 2024 has yet to be identified and is centered on the dense ridge\nabout I\' south of the bright mid-infrared source IRS 2. The data presented here, along with other\nobservations, allow us to describe a model for the source.\n\n17. Key Words (Suggested by Author(s))\n\n18.
