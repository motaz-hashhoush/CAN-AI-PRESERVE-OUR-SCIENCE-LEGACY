This led to the design and development of the Georgia Tech Electronic Flight Instrument Research Tool (GT-EFIRT). GT-EFIRT is a part-task flight simulator specifically designed to study aircraft display design and single pilot interaction. ne simulator, using commercially available graphics and Unix workstations, replicates to a high level of fidelity the Electronic Flight Instrument Systems (EFIS), Flight Management Computer (FMC) and Auto Flight Director System (AFDS) of the Boeing 757/767 aircraft. The simulator can be configured to present information using conventional looking B757n67 displays or next generation Primary Flight Displays (PFD) such as found on the Beech Starship and MD-11.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980236906, "id": "fb40b19435294a3d99d2a5ec52ab0ccf", "publicationDate": "1998-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980236906.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980236906/downloads/19980236906.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980236906/downloads/19980236906.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980236906/downloads/19980236906.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
