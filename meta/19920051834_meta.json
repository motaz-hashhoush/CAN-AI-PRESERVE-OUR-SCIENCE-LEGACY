To accomplish this, techniques which do not preserve the sparsity pattern were applied in an iterative approach that forces the preservation of the zero/nonzero pattern of the original stiffness matrix. This approach showed impressive results for locating damaged truss members. In addition, this approach also provides understanding of optimal updates in general.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19920051834, "endDate": "1992-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference", "location": "Dallas, TX", "id": "c903b61072404297bd9215c9d0ae7b1a", "startDate": "1992-04-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920051834, "id": "2182392e793e463bb4c4ec1d7feae95d", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
