Relative data collected by polar orbiting satellites are also being studied. Techniques used to separate external and internal fields from the vector data along the orbital paths; analysis of the frequency of the toroidal current in the equatorial ionosphere; investigation of the sudden storm commencement observed by MAGSAT; determination of the structure of field aligned currents associated with substorms; and calculation of the total electric current passing through the plane encircled by the MAGSAT orbit are discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830006318, "id": "ee595f02f5e94754b88aee0982f7b144", "publicationDate": "1982-08-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830006318.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830006318/downloads/19830006318.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830006318/downloads/19830006318.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830006318/downloads/19830006318.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
