Accordingly, the problems of developing the means to interact with asteroids and comets for purposes of defence, scientific study, exploration, and resource utilisation have grown in importance over the past several decades. Since the 1980s, more and more asteroids and comets (especially the former) have been discovered, radically changing our picture of the solar system. At the beginning of the year 1980, approximately 9,000 asteroids were known to exist. By the beginning of 2001, that number had risen to approximately 125,000 thanks to the Earth-based telescopic survey efforts of the era, particularly the emergence of modern automated telescopic search systems, pioneered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s (MIT\u2019s) LINEAR system in the mid-to-late 1990s. Today, in late 2019, about 840,000 asteroids have been discovered, with more and more being found every week, month, and year. Of those, approximately 21,400 are categorised as near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), 2,000 of which are categorised as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) and 2,749 of which are categorised as potentially accessible. The hazards posed to us by asteroids affect people everywhere around the world. As well, the opportunities presented by asteroids may benefit our entire species. Thus, with such a large number of currently known asteroids and so many yet to be discovered, it is not surprising that individuals, organisations, institutions, and governments all around the world have become interested in the study of asteroids. Indeed, a variety of government space agencies, private organisations, and individuals have worked on developing the means by which to observe, study, and even interact with asteroids and comets for purposes including science, exploration, pioneering, commerce, and planetary defence. This includes significant individual contributions by amateur asteroid astronomers all over the world. International cooperation in planetary defence within the contexts of the United Nations and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) are discussed in Chapter 2, and the activities undertaken by the world\u2019s larger space agencies, ESA and NASA, are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. But, what of the other agencies and institutions around the world who are also working on the problem of defence against hazardous asteroids and comets, or related topics? In this chapter we provide an overview, in alphabetical order, of some of the planetary defence related efforts that have been undertaken around the world beyond the activities at the United Nations, NASA, and ESA. \n\n\n\n\n", "title": "Planetary Defence Activities Beyond NASA and ESA", "stiType": "BOOK_CHAPTER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2020-01-27T11:42:20.2100000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20200000545, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Barbee, Brent W."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "69ef84f7c8b44a97ba8baf181ccea545"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Book Chapter", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20200000545, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20200000545, "id": "7b4ee4e448f444eb9553919bce11940c", "publicationDate": "2020-01-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20200000545.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20200000545/downloads/20200000545.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20200000545/downloads/20200000545.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20200000545/downloads/20200000545.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
