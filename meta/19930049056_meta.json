It is proposed to use triethanolamine as a nucleation control agent to control the time release of Al in a zeolite A solution and to increase the average and maximum crystal size by 25-50 times. Large zeolites could be utilized to make membranes for reactors/separators which will substantially increase their efficiency.", "title": "Large zeolites - Why and how to grow in space", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T00:57:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930049056, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sacco, Albert, Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "Worcester Polytechnic Inst.", "location": "MA, United States"}}, "id": "f85b460b745345e99168344af278cd55"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930049056, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930049056, "publisher": "Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers", "id": "142e25a6772e4f4582da3f3269ec182c", "publicationName": "In: Crystal growth in space and related optical diagnostics; Proceedings of the Meeting, San Diego, CA, July 22, 23, 1991 (A93-33051 12-29)", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
