An optimum site should have geologic units of widely diverse ages and chemical compositions occurring in close enough proximity and in smooth enough terrain so that a roving vehicle of limited traverse ability (+ or - 100 km) could collect representative samples. In FY 1986, geologic maps were compiled at 1:500,000 and 1:2 million scales of the Mangala Valles, Kasei Valles, Chasma Boreale (north polar), and Planum Australe (south polar) areas, and a study was begun of the topography and surface roughness characteristics of the Mangala Valles site. Geologic mapping has been greatly facilitated by specially enhanced, high-resolution Viking photographs, which clarify stratigraphic relations of units unrecognized earlier. Photoclinometric profiles of topographic features provide width and depth measurements of four classes of channels, the thickness of some volcanic units, and the throw on some faults. Estimates of the surface roughness of units are calculated using a newly developed USGS computer program and using measurements derived from Earth-based radar.", "title": "Martian terrains", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T11:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870014122, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Masursky, Harold"}, "organization": {"name": "Geological Survey", "location": "Flagstaff, AZ, United States"}}, "id": "4f340b4267a24eae978295d4326ab1ef"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19870014122, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chapman, M.
