For effective temperatures larger than 6200 K we find a group of stars for which the silicon to carbon abundance ratio appears to be increased. These stars are presumably descendents from AP stars on Am stars with increased surface silicon to carbon abundance ratios. Around B-V approximately equal to 0.45 this anomaly disappears as is to be expected due to the inceased depth of the convection zone and therefore deeper mixing which dilutes the surface overabundances. Unexplained is the apparent increased silicon to carbon abundance ratio observed for several stars cooler than 5100 K. RS CVn and related stars do not show this increased abundance ratio.", "title": "Silicon abundance in Population I giants", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T22:32:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950042319, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bomh-Vitense, Erika"}, "organization": {"name": "Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA", "location": "United States"}}, "id": "c81d717d3b5641f180189ee6091cc84a"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950042319, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1086/116819", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "106", "submissionId": 19950042319, "issue": "6", "issn": "0004-6256", "id": "2c799fe7e3424ec9a8ec1b809d7ef289", "publicationName": "The Astronomical Journal", "publicationDate": "1993-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
