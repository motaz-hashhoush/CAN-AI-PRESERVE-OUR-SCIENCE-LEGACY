Primary constraints are the lunar environment, the astronaut's space suit and the strength limits of the astronaut on the moon. A multipurpose rotary motion tool and a collapsible tool carrier were designed. For the rotary tool, a brushless motor and controls were specified, a material for the housing was chosen, bearings and lubrication were recommended and a planetary reduction gear attachment was designed. The tool carrier was designed primarily for ease of access to the tools and fasteners. A material was selected and structural analysis was performed on the carrier. Recommendations were made about the limitations of human performance and about possible attachments to the torque driver.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900014265, "id": "5ce63bd7c4f14c8784ce93b36b98c760", "publicationDate": "1987-12-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900014265.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900014265/downloads/19900014265.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900014265/downloads/19900014265.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900014265/downloads/19900014265.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
