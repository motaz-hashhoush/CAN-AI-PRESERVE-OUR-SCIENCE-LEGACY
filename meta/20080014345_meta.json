Columbia (STS-35) was on Launch Pad A for a scheduled May 30 launch when we discovered the hydrogen leak during - tanking. The external fuel tank is loaded through the orbiter. Liquid hydrogen flows through a 17-inch umbilical between the orbiter and the tank. During fueling, we purge the aft fuselage with gaseous nitrogen to reduce the risk of fire, and we have a leak-detection system in the mobile launch platform, which samples (via tygon tubing) the atmosphere in and around the vehicle, drawing it down to a mass spectrometer that analyzes its composition. When we progressed to the stage of tanking where liquid hydrogen flows through the vehicle, the concentration of hydrogen approached four percent-the limit above which it would be dangerously flammable. We had a leak. We did everything we could think of to find it, and the contractor who supplied the flight hardware was there every day, working alongside us. We did tanking tests, which involved instrumenting the suspected leak sources, and cryo-loaded the external tank to try to isolate precisely where the leak originated. We switched out umbilicals; we replaced the seals between the umbilical and the orbiter. We inspected the seals microscopically and found no flaws. We replaced the recirculation pumps, and we found and replaced a damaged teflon seal in a main propulsion system detent cover, which holds the prevalve-the main valve supplying hydrogen to Space Shuttle Main Engine 3 -in the open position. The seal passed leak tests at ambient temperature but leaked when cryogenic temperatures were applied. We added new leak sensors-up to twenty at a time and tried to be methodical in our placements to narrow down the possible sources of the problem. We even switched orbiters, sending Columbia back to the Vehicle Assembly Building and bringing out Atlantis, scheduled to fly as STS-38. Two shuttles on their mobile launchers passing in the night was a majestic sight, but not one you want to see if you're trying to get an orbiter launched. None of this told us where the leak was, or if we were dealing with more than one leak source.", "title": "The Summer of Hydrogen", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T05:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080014345, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Weber, Philip"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "83872d1f749d499fb8d945128ab5e22d"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080014345, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080014345, "id": "e1c79b629fce47a786921d8f08696315", "publicationName": "Ask Magazine", "publicationDate": "2008-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20080014343, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Ask Magazine", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080014345.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080014345/downloads/20080014345.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080014345/downloads/20080014345.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080014345/downloads/20080014345.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
