The parts tested are tantalum polymer, BX and P90 type ceramic capacitors, thick film resistors, analog multiplexers, a digital inverter, and a D-flip-flop. These parts were tested to assist identifying candidate components that can be used for development of a cold capable telemetry board. There are several past investigations that have shown that COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) capacitors and resistors tested at cryogenic temperatures and frequencies up to 10MHz did not exhibit significant changes in capacitance and resistance values. Also, there are several test results for active parts. These past tests collected measurements during a temperature sweep from room temperature down to cryogenic temperature with very short dwell time at cryogenic temperature, and back to room temperature. This study extends the operational dwell time to at least 24 hours and returning to room temperature operation without significant degradation in performance, thus, demonstrating the potential for longer dwell time in actual operation in these extreme cold temperatures and a method for identifying the cold operability.", "title": "Select Electronic Parts Operation at Extreme Low Temperature", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000771, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ashtijou, Mohammad"}}, "id": "43699bff046d4b3d97a30c4ef0bae4f4"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000771, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yang-Scharlotta, Jean"}}, "id": "3940045827544fd596c472ba1ceed4a0"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000771, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hanelli, Armian"}}, "id": "707b271e0ee44f08924a67b0525d8262"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000771, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Han, Michael"}}, "id": "8be830f870f04ae4aa911d1eaeb65fbf"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000771, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Saebi, Arad"}}, "id": "d1de0dcd96874b87a36aaad547a9264c"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000771, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mojarradi, Mohammad M"}}, "id": "4947a72649f6483b9932c533d4275187"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000771, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Castillo, Linda Del"}}, "id": "2288ab03f8c145efbf99e6999aa7c777"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000771, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Norton, William E"}}, "id": "1fed3f4024cf4444a4e0e6b96809803c"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000771, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wang, Ziming"}}, "id": "ae2f846b37a94b2894ad228c51937c24"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000771, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Balock, Benjamin"}}, "id": "43fdee5be8a347dfa6aa4c2852da891e"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:43:46.0087120+00:00", "id": 20220000771, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/52263", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20220000771, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2020", "id": "09d3830f78f84f1e84e9d28706bfcbf9", "publicationDate": "2020-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
