Notice in t h i s\nFigure, which was produced by the NASA/Lockheed\nTCV Program, t h a t they investigated the possib i l i t i e s of travelling several ways, including\na great c i r c l e route, a more or l e s s straightline route, and following wind circulation\npatterns. I t i s interesting that the longest\nroute actually uses the l e a s t fuel, some 14 percent less than the great c i r c l e route. This i s\nan example of the kinds of fuel savings t h a t are\npossible. I think this i s an isolated example\nand probably not one you would expect routinely,\nTo p u t this i n t o perspective, just one percent\nof the a i r c a r r i e r fuel i s 100 million gallons\nper year. So we think t h a t improving the observation system has an enormous potential and\nprobably could easily pay for i t s e l f i n a year.\nThat i s , pay for i t s e l f i n terms of reduced\n\'fuel bi 11s.\n\nThere is an am:-iguity i n the t i t l e , "Existing\nYind Observation Network".

(F!qvre 1 )\n\nFor Fuel EfficientFlight Planning\nand Air TrafficControl"\n\nFigure 1. Proposed Experimental System\nA t the l a s t workshop, our office presented a\n\npaper describing the need for better meteorological systems f o r fuel efficiency. W are an\ne\naviation energy organization, so that i s o u r\nnatural concern and perspective. Taking nothing\naway from safety concerns, w do believe t h a t\ne\nthere i s a woeful inattention in meteorology\nt o the benefits that could accrue from fuel\nsavings. So, we have turned our attention t o\nt h i s problem, The Energy Division figuratively\nbacked into the subject of meteorology because\nw were developing f l i g h t planning programs that\ne\nwould be fuel e f f i c i e n t ; and we soon found t h a t\nyou really cannot do much w i t h high technology\nf l i g h t planning programs if you don\'t know what\nare the actual w i n d and temperature fields.\n\nThe solution we see to the observation problem\ni s the profiler instrumentation being developed\na t the NOAA/ERL/PROFS Program in Colorado. I\nneed not go into the d e t a i l s of the program\nhere. Some broad characteristics of the instrumentation and of the program can be seen in\nFiqure 3, Importantly, the instrumentatipn can\nfunction in clear a i r as well as cloudy air=\n56\n\nd\n\nRoute\n\nNI\nM\n\nL 1011 LB Fuel\n\nA\nB\nC\n\n1620\n1680\n1785\n\n47 ,\n500\n46 ,\n200\n43,700\n\n+14.4%\n+11,3%\n+ 5.3%\n\nOptimum 1810\n\n41,500\n\nIf the accuracy i s comparable, why replace the\nballoon system?

The future looks very\npromising f o r s a t e l l i t e s ; however, they are\nf\nmany years away as wind observing systems. O\ncourse, we have existing systems of airplanes\nflying, from which wind f i e l d s can be estimated.\nAircraft Meterological Data Reldy (AMDAR) and\nAircraft/Satell i t e Data Relay (ASDAR), the\nAeronautical Radio Incorporated Communications\n(ARINC) systems , a r e primarily used over oceans,\nalthough they could work over land, Mode-S i s\nanother airplane-type system from which ground\ncomputers could determine wind. However , in\nboth of these cases, the distribution of wind\ninformation i s n o t uniform i n time and space.,\nThere i s reason t o d o u b t t h a t such data could\nbe used t o calculate a r e l i a b l e w i n d f i e l d database.

Naturally, when people\ndraw block diagrams, they tend t o show t h e i r\nown i n t e r e s t as the largest block, The series\nof users a t the bottom of this figure, f o r\ninstance, could be depicted as large blocks in\nsomeone e l s e \' s diagram. Uhen storing t h i s wind\ndatabase i n a computer, the publicly available\ndata shown in the largest block i n t h i s diagram\ncould reside inside of someone e l s e \' s block.\nB u t the main idea i s that wherever the data come\nfrom: Mode-S, AMDAR, these profilers, or in the\nf a r future, perhaps from s a t e l l i t e s , i t i s\nimportant to s t o r e the observations themselves\ni n one place, Give them a specified format of\nspeed, direction, latitude and longitude, a l t i tude and the temperature, i f available ...p u t\nthese into a computer and give a l l users a\ntelephone number and the format andlet them pull\no u t the data a t will. Users would not have t o\nread the whole t h i n g . If one were interested i n\nonly a few locations, a program could extract\nthese few data from a time-sharing port. To me,\nthis i s an essential feature t h a t will encourage\ninnovative use of wind data b u t will i n no way\npreclude uses of further, more processed, products such as forecasts.\n\nNOAA/ERL/PROFS Profiler\n\nFigure 4 shows an example of the effectiveness\nof this new instrument system. I do not know\nwhether o r not the profiler always works t h i s\nwell; b u t these data a t l e a s t indicate the type\no f accuracy available from the system. In t h i s\nfigure, the profiler data are plotted as accuracy bars of the wind velocity i n meters per\nsecond versus altitude, The balloon measurements\nwith which they a r e compared are shown as c i r cles. Wind direction i s shown in both s e t s of\ndata a s short lines relative t o North. Notice\nthat the profiler agrees with the balloon very\nnicely U D t o the higher a l t i t u d e s , when and\nwhere the balloon i s no longer overhead. You\nshould expect t o get quite a difference i n t h i s\ncircumstance and you do. For temperature and\nvapor density, the profiler package can also do\na good job. I have had people question whether\nth-is figure i s a representative sample. A t t h i s\ntime, I cannot answer the question, b u t expect\nt o have much more information soon comparing\nthe two systems. I f this package i s as accurate\nas indicated here, then i t has the capability of\nreplacing the balloon system.\n57\nd\n\nTemperature & Moisture Comparison\n100\n\nWind Comparison\n\nI\n\nDenver Profiler\n12 Jan 1981 1600 MST\nRadiosonde\nRadiometer\n\n200\n\n----\n\n300\n*\n\nComparison of Val lo\nRadar Wind Measurem\nNov. 3, 4 PM, 1980\n\nn\n\nI\n\n400\n\nE\n.\nI\n\n0)\n\nk\n\n500\n\nv)\n\nI\nn\n0)\n\nL\n\nn\n\n600\n\nJ\n4\n\n700\n\nKey :\n\n-\n\nMin.

For\nf l i g h t planning, i t i s very important t o know\nboth the temperature and the wind f i e l d . Figure\n10 i l l u s t r a t e s the importance of knowing the\nwind field. One wants to get the best use of\nthe tailwind or minimize the headwind. A a\ns\nf l i g h t proceeds from place t o place, i t m i g h t\npay in fuel saved t o s h i f t altitudes. Only\nw i t h computers can you assimilate and use realtime wind data f o r optimum in-flight planning.\nComputer programs f o r this purpose are being\ndeveloped. Our office is progressing on a model\nt h a t w hope will t e l l exactly where to f l y as\ne\nwell as what a l t i t u d e and speed to f l y to get\nthe most out of the fuel, This technology i s\nof limited value unless the computer is provided\nactual wind data. W really do n o t know what\ne\nthe upper winds are r i g h t now. Instead, we have\nforecasts, and these are of uncertain and varying\nqual ity.\n\nFAA,\n\nNASA\n0\n\nWind and Temperature Measurements Transmitted to Central\nDatabase - Available on Demand to Flight Planners,\nForecasters, ATC, Researchers, Etc.\n\n* Target Date For Operational Prototype System - FY 84-85\n* Airline Participation to Quantify Fuel Savings\n\nFigure 7,\n\nProposed Experimental blind\nObservation Network\n\nThe functional specifications for profiler instruments are s t i l l in the early developmental\nstages. There are trade-offs t h a t could be made\ni n antenna size, and power, and frequency and\nso on; b u t i f we\'re going to develop this particularly as an aviation system, we need t o p u t\nsome real-time observation instruments i n place\nand work with them. These objectives are l i s t e d\ni n Figure 9. Our office has recently entered\ninto a contract w i t h the PROFS office, i n the\nform of an interagency agreement. W have asked\ne\nPROFS to make a preliminary investigation of\nthe specifications for aviation purposes. Also,\nw have asked that they document t h e i r estimates\ne\nof the cost of the system and the benefits in\nfuel savings.\n\nTurning to a i r t r a f f i c control, there a r e also\nbenefits (Figure 11). For integrated flow\nmanagement, real-time w i n d s would help t o\nestablish better routing. Air Traffic Control\nmight wish t o advise how t o go around severe\nweather; b u t again, i f they are t o advise from\na fuel-savings standpoint, their computers will\n59\n\nneed to know what the winds are quite accurately.\nIf ATC i s t o advise how t o plan f o r the next\nfew hours, they need better short-term wind\nprojections than seem to be currently available.\nI t seems obvious that i f real-time wind information were available, short-term projections\ncould be made more accurately. The en route\nautomation program has a number of valuable\nuses f o r real-time wind as seen i n Figure 11.\n\nConflict resolution and estimates of arrival\ntime over fixes can be improved f o r fuel\nefficiency purposes i f ATC could sharpen the\nbell-shaped distribution curve of uncertainty.\nThe tie-in to fuel conservation and system\nefficiency comes about from generally decreasing the uncertainty of exactly when an airplane\nwill be a t the next navigation p o i n t .\n\na\n\nW conclude t h a t the a v a i l a b i l i t y of widespread\ne\ncontinuous real -time upper wind and temperature\ndata will dramatically improve aviation e f f i ciency, simultaneously helping both the users\nand managers of the airways. The NOAA/ERL/PROFS\nprofiler instrument package appears t o offer a\nnear-term solution to the problem. Further development into a cost effective aviation system\nseems 1i kely, b u t interagency and pub1 i c supp o r t a r e needed t o hasten introduction of an\noperational sys tem.\n\nOptimum Route\n\nDirect Route\n\n\' at?\n\nQuestions from the Floor\n\nMinimum Fuel Route\n\nQUESTION:\n\nA couple of comments:\n\none, the fuel savings are\ngenerally accompl ished over the long-range t r i p s\nand not generally on shorter segments, by f l i g h t\nplanning and using some of these winds. As an\nexample, going from San Francisco to Nw York,\ne\nyou could achieve quite a b i t of fuel savings\nover that range. B u t , going from Chicago t o\nNw York would not be t h a t substantial.
