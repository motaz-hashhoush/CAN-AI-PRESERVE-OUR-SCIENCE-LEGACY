Zapp et al . 22 reported on the toxicity of pyrolysis products\nas early as 1955. Numerous reports have been published on the toxicity\nof pyrolysis/combustion products and on methodology; however, most of\nthese methods were designed for research and were not intended to be\napplicab l e for use as screening methods. A review of the methodologies\nused to study toxicities of combustion pr?d^fts of polymeric materials\nsoon will be completed by this committee.\nBased on the literature review, presentations at the International\nSymposium on Toxicity and Ph \xe2\x80\xa2 siology of Combustion Products, University\nof Utah, March 22-26, 1976, and presentations made to the Committee on\nApril 7, 1976,* the Committee observes that acceptable screening tests\nto evaluate the relative toxicities of aircraft materials are rot currently\navailable, as all present methods have one or more srortcomings.\nThe Committee considers the following to be requirements for an\noptimum screening test for toxicity:\na. Materials should be evaluated under both pyrolysis\nand flaming modes. Two heat fluxes should be used\nfor pyrolysis; one flux should be just below that\nwhich would produce flaming combustion, and the\nother should be just higher than the temperature\nat which pyrolysis starts. These burn conditions\nnecessitate the evaluation of each material at\nthree heal. fluxes. The samples should be exposed\n*_v known heat fluxes; however, it is highly desirable\nto measure the y surface temperature of the sample\nduring combustion. Both gaseous and particulate\ncombustion products should be mixed uniformly in\nthe chamber atmosphere without being unduly\nsubjected to surface condensation or adsorption.\nb. The time of pyrolysis or combustio , , should be\nshort compared with the animal exposure time.\n\n* Presentations were made by M.M Birky, National Bureau of Standards;\nC.R. Crane, Federal Aviai:ion Administration; H.H. Cornish, University\nof Michigan; D.P. Dressler, Harvard Medical School; R. Long, Natl.\nFire Prevention and Cont:-ol Administration; J. H. Petajau, University\nof Utah; and W.H. Rippstein, NASA\n\n1\n\nt;.\'\nV,\n\nC. It is highly deMirable to use one chamber for both\ncombustion/pyrolysis and animal exposure. This not\nonly approximates the real fire situation but prevents\nlarge losses of combustion particles and gates on the\nwalls of any transfer apparatus. The animals must be\np rotected from direct radiation from the burning\nmaterial or the hot gases. This may be done with a\nradiation barrier and a satisfactory mixing device.\nThe chamber should be aii^ight to prevent toxic gases\nfrom leaking into the laboratory; however, there should\nbe a safety pressure relief diaph r agm. The system\nmust be easy to clean between rLns.\nd. A small rodent species such as the rat or mouse should\nbe used as the animal model. Enough animals must be\nused at each exposure condition to give statistically\nvalid results.\ne. The exposure time should be in the range of 15-30\nminutes, preferably 30 minutes. Exposure time should\nbegin at the time pyrolysis or combustion products are\nreleased.\nf. The temperature in she animal chamber should not exceed\n35\xc2\xb0C; however, the best means for controlling temperature\nhas not been determined.\ng. Incapacitation was considered to be the most important\nendpoint since it should be directly related to escape\ncapability. The committee members have not yet agreed\non the type of measurement to make. The shuttle box,\nrunning wheel, and leg-flexion paradigms were discussed.\nIt vas recommended that research should be conducted to\ncomp are methods for assessing incapacitation endpoints.\n\xc2\xb0xperimental animals should be held for 2 weeks post\nexposure and the number of deaths recorded. Visual\nobservations of animal behavior and physical condition\nduring and after exposure are considered extremely\nimportant; thus these should be done by v qualified\ninvestigator. Some type of q.antitative test may be\nrequired to evaluate observations made by the investigator. Carboxy-hemoglobin should be measured in the\nanimal at the end of the exposure. It is also Highly\ndesirable to measure the respiration rate and nrher\nphysiologic parameters in at least one animal during\nthe exposure\t\nThe smoke density in the animal chamber\n\ns!.j"Id be measured during the animal exposure.\n\n2\n\nh. In addition to temperature, carbon monoxide, carbon\ndioxide, humidity, and oxyge:i levels should be monitored\nin the chamber during animal exposure. The oxygen\nshuuld be maintained above 167.. Other expected toxic\ndegradation products such as hydrochloric acid or\nhydrogen cyanide should be monitored.\ni. The amount of material :ombusted or pyrolyzed within\nthe chamber should be determined. Dose should be\nexpressed in mg/m 3 and should give an endpoint in\n30 minutes.\nJ. Relative toxicity of materials should be determined\nby comparing test materials with reference materials,\nthose in use or candidate materials, rather than\nattempting to make absolute toxicity evaluations.\nMost current procedures for determining the toxicity of combustion\nproducts involve the transfer of the p roducts; therefore, theyy do not\nmeet requirement c. The official testing methods of Germany lZ and\nJapan 13 involve the transfer of comF stion products and use combustion\ntubes rather than a radiant heat source. The method of Smith et &1 .20\ninvolves such a short transfer of gases that it may be interpreted to\nfulf\'.11 the requirement of not transferring combustion products;\nhowever, this procedure does not make use of a radiant heat source.\nThe apparatus in use at the University of Utah\', 16 probably comes\nclosest to meeting the equipment parameters outlined above; however,\nthe number of animals exposed at one time should be increased.\nThe optimum screening test for toxicity in this progress report\nwill require the development of a prototype test apparatus and experimental validation of the foregoing parameters for sensitivity and\nreproducibility. It is suggested that NASA may wish to consider the\nrequirements listed above in setting up their evaluations of the\ntoxicities of aircraft materials subjected to fire.\nThe Committee will require additional time for the preparation of\na formal report. T;Ze report will include a detailed review of currently\nused methods for fire-toxicity testing and more detailed description\nof \'he optimum toxicity screening test. The test parameters may be\nmodified at,:er farther study by the Committee.\n\n3\n\nA^.\n\nReferences\n1. Alarie, Y. C., E. Wilson, T. Civic, J.H. Magill, J. M. Funt, C. Barrow,\nand J.
