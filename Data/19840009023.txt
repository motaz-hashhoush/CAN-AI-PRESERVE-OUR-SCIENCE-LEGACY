These include volcanic,\naeolian, fluvial, glacial, periglacial, and cratering processes, all of which\ncan result in both depositional and erosional features. However, as these\nprocesses cannot be observed in situ over geologic time, it is necessary to\ninfer them by assessing the resultant surfaces through remote sensing. Much\nof the effort toward this goal has involved the use of spacecraft images to\nevaluate the morphology of the surface. The images have limited resolution\nhowever, and do not provide direct information on small (sub-meter) surface\nErT\n\nstructures; however, in order to understand certain physical processes, small\nscale features often are the most diagnostic. For example, a well-sorted\naeolian deposit could be distinguished from poorly-sorted deposits of other\norigin (glacial, fluvial, etc.) if data on particle sizes were known.\nThe Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) provides information on the\nscale of individual particles. This instrument obtained data in five thermal\nchannels centered on 7, 9, 11, 15 and 20 um and in one solar channel centered\nat 1.7 um. Extensive processing and analyses are required before these data\ncan be used to interpret the surface. Early work in the IRTM project involved\nunderstanding the properties of the instruments, converting the measured\nenergy flux into brightness temperatures, and comparing the derived data to a\nfirst-order thermal model based on Mariner 9 IRR results (Kieffer, 1976;\nKieffer et al., 1976a,b,c; Chase et al., 1978) \t\n\nResults showed that a simple\n\nmodel of the surface is insufficient to explain the characteristics of the\nobservations. The atmosphere was found to contribute to the measured thermal\nflux, an effect that had to be modeled and removed in order to isolate surface\ncharacteristics (Kieffer et al., 1977; Martin et al., 1979; Jakosky, 1979;\n\nI\n\n2\n\nHunt, 1979, 1980). Other deviations from a simple thermal model include\nblocks.on the surface, slopes, CO2 condensation, and a layered surface\nstructure (Jakosky, 1979; Christensen and Kieffer, 1980; Christensen, 1982).\nThe next stage of analysis considered the spatial distribution of the IRTM\nF\t\n\nresults. Two measured parameters, the predawn temperature residuals between\n\nt:\nthe 20 um temperature (T20) and the Viking thermal model (Kieffer et al.,\n1977; Zimbelman and Kieffer, 1979) and the Lambert albedo (Kieffer et al.,\n1977; Pleskot and Miner, 1980) have been mapped globally. In addition, data\nfrom the 20 um thermal band and the albedo channel have been combined to\nderive and map the basic thermal parameter, the thermal inertia, I - (kpc)112,\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, p is tt: density and c is the specific\nheat (Kieffer et al., 1977; Christensen and Kieffer, 1979; Palluconi and\nKieffer, 1980). This parameter varies primarily with the average grain size\nof the material in the top few centimeters of the surface.\nUsing these measured and derived thermal properties, some work has been\ndirected toward determining the processes involved in the formation of the\nsurface materials. These studies include the investigation of dust storm\ndevelopment (Peterfreund and Kieffer, 1980), wind streak formation\n(Peterfreund, 1980), channel formation (Christensen and Kieffer, 1979),\nvolcanic flow characteristics (Schaber, 1980) and polar cap processes (Kieffer\net al., 1976b; Kieffer, 1979), and characteristics of the cratered terrain\n(Zimbelman and Greeley, 1982).\nAlthough the determination of the thermal inertia represents a significant\nadvancement in the understanding of the surface, it does not provide a unique\nsolution to the size distribution of surface materials. A surface with a\ngiven inertia can be composed of any combination of material sizes which\naverage to the grain size implied by the derived thermal inertia. This\n\n3\nambiguity was resolved in Phase I of this project by studying the variation of\ntemperature and albedo with viewing geometry (Christensen, 1981, 1982,\nAppendix 2). These data provided information on the regolith block\npopulation, fine component (e.g. sand) thermal inertia, and surface\nemissivity.\nThe surface properties derived from the IRTM data will be integrated with\nthe surface properties derived from photogeology, Earth-based radar (Schaber,\n1980; Jakosky and Muhleman, 1980) and from Earth-based spectral studies\n(Singer et al., 1979, 1982). Information on the surface from these data sets\nwill be correlated to derive interpretations of the surface geology on Mars.\nProgress\nAttached are published reports giving the results of this investigation\nthrough this report period.\n\n'
