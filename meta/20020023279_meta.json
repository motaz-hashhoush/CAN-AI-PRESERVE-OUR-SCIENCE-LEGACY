With the use of a 2D version of our Numerical Spectral Model (NSM) that incorporates Hines'Doppler Spread Parameterization (DSP) for gravity waves (GW), we demonstrate that beat periods between 9 and I I years can be generated by the QBO as it interacts through GW filtering with the Annual Oscillation (AO) and Semi-annual Oscillation (SAO). Results are discussed from computations covering up to 50 years, and our analyses leads to the following conclusions. The QDO as a stand-alone signature is largely confined to the upper mesosphere. Its largest signature appears in the form of amplitude modulations of the QBO, AO and SAO, and these extend into the lower stratosphere. The downward control that characterizes the QBO apparently comes into play, and the longer time constants for diffusion and radiative loss at lower altitudes facilitate the QDO response. Although excited by the QBO, which is confined to low latitudes, the QDO is shown to extend to high latitudes. The effect is particularly large for the QBO with period around 33.5 month (near the upper limit of observations), which interacts with the SAO to produce a hemispherically symmetric QDO. Our analysis indicates that the QDO is transferred to high latitudes by the meridional circulation, which prominently exhibits this periodicity particularly in the amplitude modulation of the AO. The propensity for beat periods around 10 years may help to increase significantly the efficiency for generating solar cycle signatures in the atmosphere, and we discuss numerical experiments related to that.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020023279, "endDate": "2001-12-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Geophysical Union", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "db749510afa94c0b8ccfa9c588df75dc", "id": "8d937b3b71a24c1f847fa97aa5de80fc"}], "name": "2001 Fall AGU Meeting", "location": "San Francisco, CA", "id": "db749510afa94c0b8ccfa9c588df75dc", "startDate": "2001-12-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020023279, "id": "48cf7ae1c4224bc8a724dcc2d98e09ad", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
