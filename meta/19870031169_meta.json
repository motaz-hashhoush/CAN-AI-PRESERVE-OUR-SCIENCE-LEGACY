A histogram of U.S. space launches between 1957 and 1983 shows that the peak activity came in 1966. Launchings of vehicles for planetary exploration also peaked in 1966, but the decreasing rate since that time has been partially offset by increased payload sophistication. Missions discussed include: the Galileo mission to Jupiter, several missions to Halley's comet, and missions to Venus. Missions in the early stages of planning include a Venus Radar Mapper, a Mars Geoscience/Climatology Orbiter, an ESA mission (Kepler) to orbit Mars, and a NASA Comet Rendezvous and Asteroid Flyby mission.", "title": "Future planetary exploration", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T03:23:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870031169, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kivelson, M.
