Ernest\n\nA voltage regulated D C to DC converter is disclosed\nwhich is operable over a wide range of input voltage\nincluding voltages greater or less than the desired output voltage. The converter uses an inductor and a capacitor as storage elements, the inductor being composed of two windings having a common junction. A\ntransformer having a center tap connected to the common junction of the two windings of the inductor is\nconnected at either end of its winding to ground\nthrough controlled switches. One winding of the inductor and either end of the transformer winding are connected by respective power diodes to the capacitor\nwhich supplies the output voltage to a load. The other\nwinding of the inductor is connected to a fourth power\ndiode as a clamping diode. Input voltage is supplied to\nthe inductor through a third controlled switch. A pulse\nwidth modulator connected to the output of the converter alternately closes and opens the switches connected to either end of the transformer winding and also\ncloses the switch supplying input voltage to the inductor each time either of the switches connected to the\nends of the transformer winding are closed. The duty\ncycle of the closing and opening of the several switches\nis adjusted by the pulse modula\nput voltage.\n\nRodriguez, Silver Spring, both of\nMd.\n[73] Assignee:\n\nThe United States of America as\nrepresented by the Administrator of\nthe National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration,Washington, D.C.\n\n[21] Appl.

The general requirements for such converters 2o\nare for high efficiency, small converter Size and weight,\ngood output voltage regulation, small output ripple, and\nthe capacity to withstand wide load variations. Additional requirements are often dictated by the specific\napplication of the converter. Perhaps the next Severe 25\nrequirements imposed On such converters are those\nin a\ndictated by space\nas, for\nmunications or meteorological satellite. In such application% the input power\nis\nby\nbatteries which are charged by solar cell arrays. Since 30\nthe \'Iar\narrays are periodically shaded by the\nearth, the state of charge of the batteries and hence the\ninput voltage varies widely. Because of the wide variation in input voltage, the DC to DC converter in this\nparticular application must be capable of providing 35\nboth buck and boost in order to provide a continuously\nregulated output voltage of the desirec value.\nOne previous approach was to provide either a buck\nfollowed by a boost or a boost followed by a buck.\neither case, the boost circuit comprised a center tapped @\ntransformer winding the ends of which were connected\nto ground through controlled switches. The ends of the\ntransformer winding were also connected by power\ndiodes to an inductor and a capacitor which acted as\nstorage elements. The voltage across the capacitor was 45\nsupplied to a pulse width modulator to alternately open\nand close the switches connected to the ends of the\ntransformer winding. Input voltage to the boost circuit\nwas supplied to the center tap of the transformer winding. The buck circuit included another inductor SUP- 50\nplied with an input voltage via a third controlled\nswitch. This inductor supplied voltage to another capacitor, and the voltage across this capacitor was sensed\nby a second pulse width modulator which controlled\n55\nthe opening and closing of the third switch.\nhere are several disadvantages associated with this\noach whether implemented as a buck followed by a\nboost or a boost followed by a buck. First of all, two\npulse width modulators are required, one for the boost\ncircuit and one for the buck circuit. This, of course, 60\ncomplicates the circuit with an attendant lowering of\nboth reliability and efficiency. Second, separate inducand capacitors are required in each of the buck and\nst circuits which greatly adds to the bulk and weight\nof the converter. Third, considerable care must be exer- 65\ncised in the design of the boost circuit to prevent the\nsimultaneous conduction (overlap) of the controlled\nswitches connecting the ends of the transformer wind-\n\n2\n\ning to ground. In addition to these disadvantages, high\nripple currents in more than one capacitor are produced, and the maximum voltage of the switches connected to the ends of the transformer winding and the\nboost circuit is twice the input voltage.\nAnother approach was to Provide an energy storage\nboost followed by a buck or vice versa. In either case,\nthe energy storage boost circuit comprised an inductor\nconnected in series with a power diode between positive input and output terminals. An energy storage capacitor was connected across the output terminals, and\na controlled switch was connected between the junction of the inductor and the power diode and ground. A\npulse width modulator was connected across the output\nof the capacitor and controlled the opening and closing\nof the switch. The buck circuit included a controlled\nswitch connected in series with an inductor between\npositive input and output terminals with a capacitor\nconnected across the output. \'A power diode was connected between the junction of the controlled switch\nand the inductor and ground. A second pulse width\nmodulator was connected across the capacitor and controlled the opening and closing of the switch supplying\nthe inductor of the buck circuit. Again, there are several\ndisadvantages to this approach. First, two pulse width\nmodulators are required. Second, additional inductors\nand capacitors are required. Third, high ripple currents\nthan one capacitor.\nare produced in\nAnother approach was to use a phase controlled\nbuckhoost configuration. This arrangement has\nsimilarities to the first described circuit except that the\npulse width modulators are replaced by oscillators. A\nfree running oscillator controls the switches which are\nconnected to either end of the transformer winding in\nthe boost circuit. A single inductor and capacitor are\nused as storage elements for both buck and boost, and\nthe power diodes connected to either end of the transformer winding are connected by third and fourth controlled switches to the inductor. A phase\noscillator is connected across the output capacitor to\ncontrol the opening and closing of the third and fourth\nswitches*\nWhile the phase controlled buckhoost approach\ndoes have the advantage of eliminating one of the inductors and capacitors, two oscillators are still required\nto control the several switches. Care must be exercised\nin design of this type of circuit to Prevent the simultaneous conduction (overlap) of the switches Connected\nto either end of te transformer winding. Moreover,\nthese switches operate at twice the input voltage.\nThere has been yet another approach to providing\nboth buck and boost in a D C to D C converter which\nresults in considerable simplification over any of the\ncircuits described thus far. This approach may be characterized as the energy storage approach and is typically implemented with a transformer having a primary\nwinding connected in series with a controlled switch\nacross a source of input voltage. The secondary winding of the transformer is connected by a power diode to\ncharge a storage capacitor connected across the output\nof the converter. A pulse width modulator is connected\nacross the capacitor and controls the switch in series\nwith the primary winding to provide a regulated output\nvoltage. While very appealing in its simplicity, this\napproach has some significant disadvantages including\nhigh ripple currents at the output of the converter and\nhigh peak currents through the controlled switch in\n\n3\n\n4,245,286\n\n4\n\nseries with the primary of the transformer. In addition,\nFIGS. 3a. 36 and 3c are pulse waveforms illustrating\nthe switching control pulses from the pulse width modthis switch operates at greater than the input voltage.\nNot only is it desirable in a space application; such as\nulator when the input voltage is low; and\na satellite power supply, to simplify the circbitry for\nFIG. 4 is a detailed block and schematic diagram of\nreasons of bulk and weight limitations, but it is vitally 5 the Preferred embodiment of the invention.\nimportant that both the efficiency and the reliability of\nDESCRIPTION O F THE PREFERRED\nthe circuit be as high as possible. Obviously, increased\nEMBDDIMENT\nefficiency leads to lower power source requirements\nWith reference to FIG. 1, the input voltage is SUPand substantially less heat dissipation. Since the controlled switches of the DC to DC converters are typi- 10 plied across input terminals 11 and 12, terminal 12 being\ntally switching transistors, lowering of the maximum\nconnected to ground. An iron core inductor 13 is connected in series between terminal 11 and a controlled\nvoltages across these transistors and the maximum current through them will result in improved reliability of\nswitch 14 comprising parallel switching transistors 15\nand 16. Actually, a single switching transistor would\nthe power supply.\n15 suffice provided that the base drive switching pulses\nSUMMARY O F T H E INVENTION\nprovided to each of transistors 15 and 16 are provided\nto the single switching transistor.
