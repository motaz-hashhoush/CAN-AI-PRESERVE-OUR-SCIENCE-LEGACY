b'\t\nAugust 1973\t\n\nB73-10208\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGoddard Space Flight Center\nNASA Tech Briefs announce now technology derived from the U.S. space program. They are issued to encourage\ncommercial application. Tech Briefs are available on a subscription basis from the National Technical Information\nService, Springfield, Virginia 22151. Requests for individual copies or questions relating to the Tech Brief program may\nbe directed to the Technology Utilization Office, NASA, Code KT, Washington, D.C. 20546.\n\nThermally Responsive Mechanical Actuator\nThe problem:\nMost materials expand in heat and contract in cold.\nThis property is very useful in heat control, heat\nmeasurement, and mechanical actuation by heat. Devices\nbuilt for such applications include thermometers, thermostats, safety switches, circuit breakers, and mechanical\nactuators, to name a few. However, in each device, a\ndifferent material is actuated by the heat. It would be a\nmajor technical improvement to have one material that\ncould be used in most if not all of these devices.\n\nThe solution:\n\nColored\t\nFluid\t\n\nSilicone\nRubber\n\nFigure 1. Glass Thermometer\n\nSilicone rubber has the highest coefficient of expansion of any known material and seems suitable for\nmost of these devices.\nStandard\nPressure\nGauge With\nBourdon Tube\n\nHow it\'s done:\nSilicone rubber has the following advantages:\n1. It has the highest coefficient of expansion of any\nknown material. The coefficient of expansion ranges\nfrom 5.9 x 10 to 6.9 x 104/\xc2\xb0C.\n2. It is flexible enough to be fitted into all kinds of\nenclosures.\n3. Because it is a solid, it does not require seals as in the\ngas- and liquid-actuated devices.\n4. It provides higher work output per given unit of heat\nthan any other material.\n5. It is very inexpensive.\n6. It can be molded into any shape.\n7. It can sustain temperatures up to 6000 F.\nThe illustrations below show some practical applications of silicone rubber. Figure 1 shows the standard\nglass thermometer using silicone rubber and colored\nfluid to indicate temperature. A temperature gauge that\nis activated by expanding or contracting silicone rubber\nis shown in Figure 2. Finally, two mechanical actuator\nmodels using silicone rubber are shown in Figures 3 and\n4.\n\nFluid\t\n(e.g., Oil)\n\nSilicone\t\nRubber\t\n\nir\n\nFluid\nFill and\nCalibrating\nScrew\n\n--,.
