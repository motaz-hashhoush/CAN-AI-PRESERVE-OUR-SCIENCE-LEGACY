The\nmanufacturing technology, as described by a Format A for each process,\nis a major part of the input to the model of the manufacturing industry\nthat is used in SAMICS to estimate the prices of the products of that\ntechnology. The section entitled "The Format A Appendix" contains an\nexample of additional descriptive information that might accomrany\nFormat A, and includes an exemplary completed version of Format A.\nLine-by-line explanations of the standard Company Description\nFormat, Format B, and of the standard Industry Description Format,\nFormat C, are also provided to permit delineation of the structure of\nthe modeled industry. When SAMICS is used to compare the economic\nviability of alternative manufacturing processes, much of the structure\nis prespecified. (See, for example, the SAMICS Workbook, 3PL Document\n5101-15.)\n\n1-1\n\nSECTION II\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION - FORMAT A\n\nFabrication of a company\'s product(s) generally requires the\nperformance of a sequence of operations or processes. The purpose of\nFormat A (page 2-3) is to describe the economically important characteristics of one of these processes.\nSegregation of the process sequence into separate processes is, at\nleast in some cases, somewhat arbitrary. In those cases, the guideline\nto follow is to distinguish between separate machines or separate pieces\nof apparatus. Usually Format A will describe a particular kind of\nequipment, such a a distillation tower or a diffusion furnace. Sometimes Format A will describe a collection of equipment, such as a\nquality control inspection station or part of a materials handling\nsystem. Other times Format A might describe a processing step performed\nby special facilities, such as :storage between manufacuring operations\nor a chemical reaction in a high-pressure tank.\nAl. Process Referent. This is a unique and conveniently short\nidentifier (no more than 9 characters with no embedded blanks) which\nwill be used to refer to this process.\nA2. Descriptive Name. This provides an opportunity to identify\nor describe the process without the 9 character limitation imposed on\nthe process referent (line Al).\n\nPART 1 - PRODUCT DESCRIPTION\nEvery process produces a product, although it may be an intermediate product which the company uses in a subsequent process but does\nnot sell. Almost every process requires one or more products as input.\n(Required products will be identified in Part 6). The process sequence\ncan be deduced by consideration of the produced product - process required product specifications. Part 1 of Format A describes the\nproduct produced by the process.\nA3. Product Referent. This is a unique and conveniently short\nidentifier (no more than 9 characters with no emL,-dded blanks) which\nwill be used to refer to the product produced by this process.\nA. Descriptive Name. This provides an opportunity to give more\ninformation about the product than can be provided within the 9 character\nlimit for product referent (line A3).\nA5. Unit of Measure. Product quantities are among the numbers\nthat will be calculated when applying SAMICS. Consequently, the units\nin which those quantites are measured must be identified.\n\n2-1\n\nPART 2 - PROCESS CHARACTERISTICS\nFormat A can be thought of as a template or pattern of the\n"machine" that performs the process being described. Thus, Process\nCharacteristics specify the operating parameters of a single machine.\nA6. Output Rate. This is the average rate at which the product\ndescribed in Part 1 is produced by this process, expressed in terms of\nproduct units (line A5) per minute of machine operation. Thus, a\ncontinuous process that produces 150 units of product every hour when\noperating, or a batch process that produces 50 units of product every 20\nminutes, would have an output rate of 2.5 units per operating minute.\nOnly usable product should be included; any resulting scrap or\n"reworkable" output product does not contribute to the output rate.\nA7. Average Time at Station. This is the average time required\nat the process, including any waiting time in the input or output\n"hopper", and is not necessarily the reciprocal of the output rate given\non line A6. For a batch process, this is the time interval between\nsuccessive batches. For a continuous process, this is the time that the\naverage unit spends at this processing step. This time quantity is used\nonly in the calculation of in--process working capital requirements.\nA8. Machine "Up" Time _\'Fraction. This is the average ratio of\nmachine operating time to factory open time, assuming round-the-clock (3\nshifts per day) operation, expressed as a decimal fraction between 0.00\nand 1.00. It iicludes consideration of down time due to machine\nfailure, warm-up, or cool-down, and any time required for replacement of\nexpendable parts (dies, screens, filters, etc.) or for employee\npreparation. This number may be thought of as the "duty cycle that\nwould occur if the machine were operating at capacity".\n\nPART 3 - EQUIPMENT COST FACTORS\nFormat A is a description of the characteristics of a machine or\nof a machine-like collection of apparatus. Parts of this machine (or\nmachine-like collection) may have different expected useful lifetimes.\nSuch differences can affect the calculation of depreciation, and must\ntherefore be identified.\nWhen different components of the "machine" have different\nlifetimes, equipment cost factors must be provided for each component,\nthough pieces of equipment with the same lifetimes may be treated as a\nsingle component. Three columns are provided in Part 3, lines A9\nthrough A14, for entering the data for (up to) three components. (If\nmore columns are needed, use additional sheets.)\nA9. Component (Referent). If there is only one component, which\nwill usually be the case, this may be omitted (when entering the process\ndescription into the SAMIS program, a blank will not be accepted: a\ncomma is recommended), and only one of the three columns will be used.\nOtherwise, this line is a unique and conveniently short identifier (no\nmore than 9 characters with no embedded blanks) which can be used to\nrefer to the particular component.\n\n2-2\n\nSOLAR ARRAY MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY COSTING STANDARDS\nFORMAT A\nn\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nET PROPI\'LSION LABORATORY\n\nNote: Names given In brackets [ 1\nare the names cf process attributes\nrequested by the SAM I S III\ncomputer program.\n\n[mitt"" of\no\t ddoreia Grote nr /T*rhsolopCalif 91109\nPardee,\nOak\ndU)\n411W)\n\nAl\t\n\nProcess (Referent]\n\nA2\t\n\n( Descriptive Name]\n\nPART 1 \xe2\x80\x94 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION\nA3\t\n\n[ Product Referent]\n\nA4\t\n\nDescriptive Name [Product Name]\n\nA5\t\n\nUnit Of Measure (Product Units].\n\nPART 2 \xe2\x80\x94 PROCESS CHARACTERISTICS\nA6\t\n\nIoutput Rate] (Not Thruput) _\n\nUnits (given on line A5) Per Operating Minute\n\nAverage Time at Station\n[Processing Time]\nA8\t\nMachine "Up" Time Fraction\n[Usage Fraction]\nPART 3 \xe2\x80\x94 EQUIPMENT COST FACTORS [Machine Description[\nA7\t\n\nA9\t\n\nCalendar Minutes (Used only to compute\nin\xe2\x80\xa2processinventory)\nOperating Minutes Per Minute\n\nComponent [Referent]\n\nAga Component [Descriptive Name) (Optional)\n\nA10 Base Year For Equipment Prices [Price Year]\nAll Purchase Price ($ Per Component) [Purchase Cost]\nAl2\t\n\nAnticipated Useful Life (Years) [Useful Life]\n\nA13 ISalvage Value] ($ Per Component)\nA14\t\n\n[Removal and Installation Cost] ($/Component)\n\nNote: The SAMIS III computer program also prompts for the (payment float interval] , the [inflation rate table] , the\n(equipment tax depreciation method), and the [equipment book depreciation method] .

Component Descriptive Name. This provides an opportunity to\ndescribe the component without the 9 character constraint of the component referent. Enough information should be given that an experienced\nengineer can judge for himself whether the cost data given below is\nreasonable.\nA10. Base Year for Equipment Prices. Due to inflation, all cost\nand price statements must be related to a specific year. It will be\nassumed that the price on line All, the value on line A13, and the cost\non line A14 are valid as of the start of the year entered on line A10.\nAll. Purchase Price ($ per Component). This is the price that\nmust be paid to purchase this component outright, expressed in base\nprice year (line A10) dollars. If the machine is to be leased or\nrented, rather than purchased, the entry on this line may be zero, but\nthen Part 4, the direct requirements per machine, must include Item\nA2288D, "Leased or rented equipment". A zero may also be entered on\nline All in the unusual circumstance that the process is performed\nentirely with special facilities, rather than with equipment.\nAl2. Anticipated Useful Life (Years). This is the expected time\ninterval, expressed in calendar years, between the installation of this\ncomponent and the installation of its replacement, taking into consideration the usage data supplied in Part 2. This lifetime does not have to\nbe an integer.\nThis is an estimate of the\nA13. Salvage Value ($ per Component)\t\namount that could be obtained for this component as salvage, after it\nhas been used for the number of years given on line Al2, expressed in\nbase price year (line A10) dollars.\nA14. Cost of Removal and Installation ($ per Component). This is\nthe cost of disconnecting and removing an old component plus the cost of\ninstalling and connecting its replacement, assuming that all of the\nutility services (gas, steam, electrical powFr, etc.) that are required\nare still in place. It will also be used to approximate the cost of\ninstalling the first component when minor modifications of the utility\nservices may have to be performed. These costs, incidentally, will be\ncapitalized, not expensed, in the financial model of the company.\n\nFORMAT A REVERSE SIDE - DIRECT REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe face side of Format A describes the output of the process and\nits economically relevant characteristics. The reverse side describes\nwhat is put directly into the process to produce that output.\nOnly direct requirements: the personnel that tend the machine,\nthe facilities and utilities services used by the machine, the\nbyproducts produced by the machine, and the commodities which are fed\ninto the machine, are to be included in the process description. All\nindirect requirements: the personnel who supervise the direct personnel\nand those who make the factory function (as distinguished from those who\nperform the processes), the facilities and utilities services that\n\n2-5\n\nsupport the people, the furniture and office supplies used to operate\nthe factory, and so on, will be supplied in a standardized fashion by\nSAMICS. Inclusion of any indirect requirements on the reverse side of\nFormat A will cause the expenses due to these indirect requirements to\nbe counted twice.\nA15. Process Referent (from page 1). This is simply a repeat of\nthe referent supplied on line Al. Its importance becomes apparent if\nthe reverse side of Format A is duplicated and therefore appears as a\nseparate sheet.\n\nPART 4 - DIRECT REQUIREMENTS PER MACHINE (Facilities) or PER MACHINE\nPER SHIFT (Personnel)\nSome of the direct requirements of the process depend not on the\noperation of the machine, but on the existence of the machine in the\nproduction area. The best example of this is the floor space\nrequirement, which clearly exists even if the machine is completely\nidle. Other facilities parameters and direct personnel requirements\nalso depend on the number of machines assumed to be in continuous\noperation.\nUse a separate line for each required item. Add additional sheets\nif necessary. (The non-sequential numbering of columns in Parts 4-6 of\nFormat A is a result of rearrangement from its original structure;\ncolumn numbers were kept unchanged when the columns were rearranged.)\nA16. Catalog Number. This is the catalog number of the required\nitem, obtained from referents in the SAMICS Cost Account Catalog (see\n"Companion Documents" in the front of this document). If a required\nitem cannot be found in the Cost Account Catalog, try to find a suitable\nsubstitute in the catalog. If there is no suitable substitute, it will\nbe necessary to create* an item for the "Temporary" account.\nA17. Requirement Description. This is the name of the item\nidentified by the catalog number in column A16.\nA18. Amount Required per Machine or per Machine per Shift. This\nis the amount of the required item used by one machine. Be sure the\namount is consistent with the units to be given in column A19 (which\nmust be the units specified in the Cost Account Catalog). Do not\narbitrarily round any amounts to integers.\n\n*Referents for "Temporary" items consist of a letter (A, B, C, D, or\nE) to identify the account in which it belongs, followed by a letter\n(to "flag" the fact that this is a temporary item and to ensure that\ntemporary item referents are unique with respect to the Cost Account\nCatalog), then by a number with no more than 7 digits. All temporary\nitem referents must be unique.\n\n2-6\n\nA19. Units. This entry :.s the type of units in which the amount\nspecified in column A18 is expressed. It must be the same as is given\nin the Cost Account Catalog, so that multiplication by the standard\nprice per unit will give a valid result. "Per machine" is implicit.\n(The user should be aware of the fact that there will be two versions of\nthe Cost Account Catalog, one with English units and one with metric,\navailable for a few months. Referents in the English unit catalog end\nin "D", "I", or "B". Eventually, only the metric unit catalog will be\nsupported.)\n\nPART 5 - DIRECT REQUIREMENTS PER BATCH\nSome of the direct requirements of the process do depend upon the\nextent to which the machine is operated, especially utilities, byproducts, and commodities.\nUse a separate line for each required item. Add additional sheets\nif necessary.\nA20. Catalog Number. As with column A16, this is the catalog\nnumber of the required item, obtained from the SAMICS Cost Account\nCatalog.\nA21. Requirement Description. As with column A17, this is the\nname of the item identified by the catalog number in colum A20.\nA22. Amount Required Per Machine Per Minute. This is the average\namount of the required item (including any wastage) required by one\nmachine each operating minute. Be sure the amount is consistent with\nthe units to be given in column A23 (which must be the units specified\nin the Cost Account Catalog). Do not arbitrarily round any amounts to\nintegers.\nA23. Units. This entry is the type of units in which the amount\nspecified in column A22 is expressed, and must be the same as is given\nin the Cost Account Catalog. "Per minute" is implicit.\n\nPART 6 - INTRA-INDUSTRY PRODUCT(S) REQUIRED\nProducts are distinguished from commodities by the fact that\nproducts are produced by processes within the modeled industry, while\ncommodities are produced outside the modeled industry. While this\ndistinction is rather artificial, it is an important one, since it\nfacilitates the description of company and industry structure. Part 6\nof Format A provides a reference to the input product(s) processed by\nthe process being described. Since it is the products which are used to\ndetermine the technological sequence of processes within a firm, the\nreferents assigned to the products of different processes must be\ndifferent (i.e., mutually unique).\n\n2-7\n\nA24. Product Reference.\' This is the identifier (a maximum of 9\ncharacters with no embedded blanks) of a product which is processed by\nthe process being described. The products identified in column A24 go\ninto the process; the product described in Part 1 comes out.\nA25. Product Name. This is the descriptive name (from line A4)\nof the product referred to in column A24.\nA26. Ideal Ratio of Units Out/Units In. This is the ratio of the\namount of the product (described in Part 1) that would be produced for\neach unit of the required product referred to in column A24 if there\nwere no yield losses. For example, if the line A3 product were "solar\nmodules," the column A24 required product were "solar cells," and 224\ncells were used in each module, then the entry in column A26 would be\n0.00446 (which is 1/224), and the units entered in column A27 would be\n"modules/cell."\nA27. Units. This is the type of units in which the ideal ratio\n(column A26) is expressed. It is simply the ratio of the "units of\nmeasure" of the output product (from line A5) to those of the required\nproduct. (See example in A26 above.)\nA28. Yield M. This is the percentage of the (input) required\nproduct that remains as usable output product. For example, if the\nprocess produces 100 cells per minute, of which, on the average, 1 is\ndefective (so that line A6 is 99 cells per minute), and it uses 101\nwafers per minute (one wafer per minute is broken during processing) to\nproduce those 99 usable cells, the yield would be 98.02 (which is 99/101\nof 100%).\n\nTHE FORMAT A APPENDIX\nThe contents of Format A typically represent some comb\'-nation of\nmeasured data and assumptions. The value and usefulness of this Format\nare greatly enhanced by describing those measurements and assumptions in\na brief appendix to be attached to each Format A. A good example of\nthis is shown in the following material, which was submitted by R. J.\nCasey of LMSC.\nThe completed Format A is shown on pages 2-9 and 2-10. Pages 2-11\nthrough 2-13 contain a general description and a schematic diagram of\nthe process under consideration. The subsequent pages consist of notes\nexplR.ining each of the numbers used in the Format A. The work carried\nout L\'n these pages was required to produce those numbers in the first\nplace, and the extra effort of presenting these extremely valuable notes\nis well worthwhile.\n\n*The term reference is used where an identifier is cited; the term\nreferent is used where an identifier is established.

Casey, LMSC, 6/29/78\n\nThis material was provided as back-up to SAMICS input as part of\nJPL contract 954898 and includes the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nA description of the texture etch process (excerpted from\nMonthly Report No. 6)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nExplanation of the Format A inputs by part and item\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nEquipment cost estimating sheets (by LMSC Plant Engineering)\n\nHIGH VOLUME PRODUCTION\nTexture Etch Process\nThe basic process specification for texture etching of silicon\nwafers was provided to LMSC (IR) by JPL. Some adjustments to procedural\ndetails were made to improve our results in processing of wafers during\nthe early portion of this contract. This modified process has been\nextrapolated to a large scale automatic etching system as would be\nrequired for 1986 production quantities.\nThe hydrogen peroxide neutralizing rinse has been eliminated in\nour projected process, as we believe that the simpler acid rinse will\nsuffice if followed by multiple DI water sprays. The system defined\nhere is configured for pilot evaluation. In this regard, it provides\nfor excess capability in terms of sodium hydroxide concentration,\nimmersion time and/or processing temperature. Optimum process\nparameters for an automated system must necessarily be established\nduring a period of trial operation of the actual system. It will be\nsimpler at that time to reduce the value of one or more of the variables\nthan to effect an increase. Impact of this approach on overall cost\nestimates is minimal. Provisions necessary to minimize downtime and\nmaintain real time process control have been considered.\nThe large number of wafers to be run through a wet system argues\nconvincingly for processing of the work pieces while they are held in\ncassettes. Accordingly, we have defined a special open frame cassette\nconfiguration for wet processing. The 3/16-inch wafer spacing is\nretained but the length is increased to approximately twelve inches to\nhold a quantity of 50 wafers. The cassettes are assumed to be loaded by\nWaferco and entered directly into the Cellco production sequence at this\ntexture etch station. They are automatically clamped to holding devices\nattached on 6-inch centers to dual conveyor chains which carry the\ncassettes through the etching steps. Conveyor speed is assumed at 2\nfeet per minute. Masking of the wafers by the cassette retaining slots\nis avoided by a technique proven by the Siltec Corporation, Cassette\nEtch Station, Model 2001, where the cassette is slowly rotated on an\neccentric longitudinal centerline. This causes the wafers to move back\nand forth in their retaining slots, exposing the entire surface to the\n\n2-11\n\nprocessing liquids. In this application, the rotation is achieved by\nspur gears on the end(s) of the cassette holders. The gears engage\nstationary gear racks as the conveyor chain moves. The conveyor path\nand the several process steps are shown schematically on the following\npage.\nThe first step in the etching process is an alcohol rinse,\nagitated by submerged jets to direct the flow between the wafers.\nVapors are recondensed and returned to a reservoir which provides makeup\nalcohol. Cassettes are then carried directly into the etchant tank and\nthrough the hot, two percent sodium hydroxide solution. Agitation is\nsimilarly provided. Level, pH, temperature and specific gravity sensors\ncontrol the makeup system. The solution is circulated in reverse flow\ndirection and filtration is accomplished by De-Laval centrifuges which\ndo not require consumable filters or labor intensive servicing. Vapors\nmay be allowed to vent to the atmosphere carrying sodium carbonate\nsalts, which are slightly basic. The next step is a tap water rinse\nwith sufficient acid added to neutralize the drag-out from etching\ntank. Ten percent of the outflow is brought to neutral pH and discarded\nto control the salt concentration. Makeup acid and water are added to\nthe remainder which is recirculated. The wafers are then carried\nthrough a series of four atomizing spray chambers where they are washed\nwith reverse cascaded DI water. Waste water from the rinse may be used\nto heat the first spray station through a heat exchanger. This wash\nwater is also reprocessed through filtration and deionizing steps.\nFinally, the wafers are dried by passing through Freon vapor where\nsurface water on the wafers is displaced. As the wafers emerge, the\nFreon evaporates. Vapors rising into the hood are recondensed and\nreturned to the system. Displaced water is removed from the Freon to\nmaintain system balance. The cassettes are then fixed in an upright\nposition and disengaged from their holders for transfer to the next\noperation.\nThe system will require computer control to maintain the several\nvariables within pre-established limits. Quality of the etch will be\nsensed by test of the reflectivity of wafers leaving the station with\nautomatic corrective action programmed. It has been suggested by IR\nthat laser induced fluorescent spectroscopy may also be employed to\ncheck for contamination levels with automatic correction or shutdown\nprocedures incorporated in the control system.\nThis texture etch jtation will process 4 cassettes or 200 wafers\nper minute. Four parallel stations will be required. Recycling\nsubsystems will be cross-manifolded between stations to minimize\ndowntime. All tanks will be castored and configured for\nquick-disconnect to allow rapid replacement and offline cleaning and/or\nrefurbishment.\n\n2-12\n\nZ \xc2\xb0C \xc2\xb0\n\n2\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n0Cce\n^^. > : r\n\nLL\n~\nv\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6\n}\n\nLL\n\nQ\n\n10\n\nN\n\nW0U\nQ\nLW `^ W\nZ\n\nLL\n\n^o\n\n^ V ^\n\nZU0\n\nI\n\nNwy^\ni\n0\n\nK0\n\n^ W\nW\n\n^Q\n\ncn\n\nU)\ncu\n\nLL\n\nU\n0\n\n10\n\np\n\na\n\nU\nLL\n\n,o\n\nLL\n\nv\t\n\nv\n0\n\nN\n\nW\nN\n41\n\n_\n\nW= W\nY\t\nZ\t\n\nOQ\n\nH\n\nLLL\nd\n\nI\nU\n\nuj\n\n0\nX\n\nGl\n\n0\n\n.0\n\no 2^U\n0\n\ncn\n\nU\n\nLU\t L ^\nW\n\nz\n\n^\t\n\nO\n\nLL\nO\n\nd\n}\n\nW\n\nQO u\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0 J\n\nw\n\nQ\n\n^^W\n\nN\n\nUJZ\nQ Q iY\n\nN\n\ns\n-10.\n\n2-13\n\nEXPLANATION OF FORMAT A INPUTS\n\nPART 2 - TEXTURE ETCH\nA-6 Output Rate\n\n\t\n\n= 200 wafers per minute\n\nDetermined by assumed conveyor speed of texture etch equipment at\n2 ft/min and spacing of 50 wafer cassettes at 6" apart.\n\nA-7 Average Time at Station\n\n\t\n\n= 38 minutes\n\nDetermined by assumed conveyor speed of texture etch equipment at\n2 ft/min x length of conveyor chain in the processing area.\n2 ft/min = 39-1/2\t\n40 minutes\n79 ft\t\n\nA-8\t\n\nProcess Usage Time Fraction \t\n\n.976\n\nDetermined on basis of assu \xe2\x96\xbaaed downtime under the following\nconditions:\nAll tanks fitted with castors and quick disconnect\nplumbing to allow rapid replacement and off-line\ncleaning\nCentrifuge filters and other stationary subsystems\ncross-manifolded to permit rapid changeover, making\nindividual units available for cleaning or service\nduring idle time\nContinuous computer control with feedback loops to\neliminate batch operations and allow continuous\noperation.

The\nprocess sequence is described explicitly; the relationships among the\ncompanies in the industry are indicated by the purchased products.\nWhen these formats are used with the SAMICS workbook, the industry\nstructure is prespecified. The only information which needs to be added\nis the process sequence, which is specified by line B4, line B5, another\nline of type B4, another line of type B5, and so on.\nB1. Company Referent. This is a unique and conveniently short\nidentifier (no more than 9 characters with no embedded blanks) which\nwill be used to refer to this company.\nB2. Description (Optional). This provides an opportunity to\ndescribe the company without the 9 charac:er limitation imposed on the\ncompany referent (line B1). This line may be left blank if line B1 is\nsufficiently descriptive.\n\nPROCESS SEQUENCE\nThe technological structure of the company is defined by its\nprocess sequence. Each product, whether it is a product produced, an\nintermediate product, or a purchased product, is the output of some\nprocess. Each process produces only one output product, and usually\nonly requires one input product. Format B is designed to accommodate\nthis simple technological structure: product produced (by the company),\nthe process that makes the product produced (by the company), the\nintermediate product that is required by the process and made by the\nnext (chronologically earlier) process, that next process, and so on,\nuntil the required product is purchased from outside the company. The\nnumber of lines of types B4 and B5 available on Format B may be more or\nfewer than are needed; leave blanks or use additional sheets, as\nnecessary.\nThe SAMICS methodology is not restricted to such a simple\nstructure, however. The user will have to lay out a tree-like structure\nif any processes require two or more intermediate products.\nB3. Product Produced. This is a reference to the product\nproduced by the company. Only a reference - and not a full description\nis required here, because products are defined on the Format A of the\nprocesses that make them.\nB4. Process. This is a reference to the process that makes the\nproduct referred to in B3 above.\n\n3-1\n\nB5. Intermediate Product. The process referred to in line B4\nwill almost always be performed on another product. This required\nproduct is referenced here. (The process that makes it is referenced\non the next line, and so on through the company\'s process sequence.)\nIf more than one product is required by the process, some ingenuity is\nneeded to display the relationship. If only commodities (that is,\nmaterials and supplies whose manufacture is not modeled) are required,\nthen this line will be left blank.\n\nPURCHASED PRODUCTS\nB6. Purchased Product. The product required to begin company\nprocessing (the last listed in B5) is referenced on this line.\nB7. Supplier. This company\'s purchased product, identified on\nline B6, may be manufactured by more than one company. The supplying\ncompanies are referenced on this line, along with the percentages of the\ntotal amount purchased that each supplies. Note: If the industry is\ndescribed so as to be "vertically" but not "horizontally" complete, care\nmust be taken in furnishing the percentages supplied to make sure the\nresulting production quantities of the next firm in sequence will be\nestimated correctly. If, on the other hand, a complete industry is\ndefined, the percentages supplied should add to 100%.\n\n3-2\n\nSOLAR ARRAY MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY COSTING STANDARDS\nFORMAT I3\nCOMPANY DESCRIPTION\nET PROPULSION LABORATORY\n1,cah l.rnia\t ln1Ulllle of Terhaology\n4ROO Oak Grore Dr. / Paredena, Calif. 91103\n\nB1\t\n\nCompany Referent\n\n82\t\n\nDescription (Optional)\n\n133\n\nProduct Produced\n\nB4\n85\n\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\nIntermediate Product\nProcess\n\nB6\nB7\n\nPurchased Product\nSupplier Company Reference\n\nPercent Supplied\n\nSupplier Company Reference\n\nPercent Supplied\n\nPrepared by\n\n\t\n\nDate\n\nJPL 3038 \xe2\x80\x94 S 1177\n\n3-3\n\nSECTION IV\nINDUSTRY DESCRIPTION - FORMAT C\n\nIndustry descriptions (Format C, page 4-3) are used in SAMICS to\nspecify the relationship between what the industry is really providing\n(the industry objective) and the hardware product that is manufactured.\nThey also identify the company or companies that make that hardware\nproduct. The rest of the industry structure can then be determined by\ntracing through the suppliers listed on a Format B, then tracing the\nsuppliers of those suppliers, and so on.\nWhen these formats are used with the SAMICS workbook, the industry\nstructure and size are prespecified. The only information which needs\nto be added is the hardware performance on line C7 and the product\ndesign description on line C8.\nCl. Industry Referent. This is a unique and conveniently short\nidentifier (no more than 9 characters with no embedded blanks) which\nwill be used to refer to this industry description.\nC2. Description (Optional). This provides an opportunity to\ndescribe the industry without the 9 character limitation imposed on the\nindustry referent (line CO. This line may be left blank if line Cl is\nsufficiently descriptive.\n\nINDUSTRY OBJECTIVE\nThe solar array manufacturing industry is engaged in providing new\nphotovoltaic solar power production capability by manufacturing flatplate silicon solar modules for installation in arrays.\nC3. Industry Result. This is a description of what the industry\nis "really" providing - if that is a meaningful concept. If the\ndistinction between "what the industry is really providing" and the\nindustry\'s "final product" is not meaningful, this line can be simply a\nrestatement of the name of the final product (which will be entered oil\nline C5); then line C7 should be unity.\nC4. Quantity Produced. This line has two parts. The first\nshould give the annual quantity of the industry result (line C3)\nproduced; the second should state the units in which that quantity is\nmeasured.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THE INDUSTRY\nThe industry\'s "result" has just been described. Now its "final\nproduct" and the relationship between the two are needed.\nC5. Reference and Name. This is a restatement of the final\nproduct (from a Format B, line B3) and its descriptive name (from a\nFormat A, line A4). It is referenced and named here for convenience in\ninterpreting the rest of this section of data.\n\n4-1\n\nC6. Production is Measured in.\t\nThis gives the type of units\n(e.g., "modules per year") in which production of the final industry\nproduct is expressed. These units must be consistent with the units\ngiven for this product on line A5 of the appropriate Format A(s).\nC7. Hardware Performance. This gives the quantitative relationship between the "industry result" and the industry\'s "final product".\nThe units of this ratio are those on line C4 divided by those on line C6.\nC8. Product Design Description (Optional). This space enables\nclarification of differences between this industry description and\nothers possibly being considered.\n\nMAKERS OF THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THE INDUSTRY\nThe structure of the industry can be provided in one of two ways:\nas horizontally complete, or not. In a horizontally complete description, all of the suppliers of each product are listed on Format B; both\nmarket shares on Format C and suppliers\' percentages on Format B will\nadd to 100%. In a horizontally incomplete description, one or more\nrepresentative suppliers of each product are described. In the latter\ncase, care must be taken in defining market shares and percentages\nsupplied to obtain companies of the correct capacity.\nC9. Company References and Market Share. This gives a reference\nto a company defined on a Format B and the share of the industry\'s\nmarket for the final product which that company supplies. (The market\nshare is expressed as a percentage.)\n\n4-2\n\nSOLAR ARRAY MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY COSTING STANDARDS\nFORMAT C\nn\nINDUSTRY DESCRIPTION\n\n8\t\nJET PROPULSION LABORATORY\n\nCalifornia Inviture of Technology\n4800 Oak Grove Dr. / Pafadena, Calif. 91103\n\nC1\t\n\nIndustry Referent _\n\nC2\t\n\nDescription (Optional)\n\nINDUSTRY OBJECTIVE\nC3\t\n\nIndustry Result\n\nC4\t\n\nQuantity Produced\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THE INDUSTRY\nC5\t\n\nReference\t\n\nC6\t\n\nProduction is Measured in\n\nC7\t\n\nHardware Performance\n\nC8\t\n\nProduct Design Description (Optional)_\n\nName\n\n(C4 per C6)\n\nMAKERS OF THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THE INDUSTRY\nC9\t\n\n\t\n\nCompany Reference\nCompany Reference\nCompany Reference\n\nPrepared by\n\nMarket Share\n\n\t\n\nMarket Share\n\t\n\nMarket Share\n\n\t\n\nDate\nJPL 3039 \xe2\x80\x94 S\t\n\n4-3\n\n1177\n\n'
