Sustainability is defined as development that meets the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The new technologies that are required for sustainable closed loop life support for space exploration have uses on the ground to reduce energy, greenhouse gas emissions, and water use. Some of these uses are reviewed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090000975, "id": "ed34cc311da34a1fa1762f26af12c921", "publicationDate": "2008-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090000975.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090000975/downloads/20090000975.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090000975/downloads/20090000975.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090000975/downloads/20090000975.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
