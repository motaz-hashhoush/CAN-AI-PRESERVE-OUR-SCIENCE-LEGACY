Two Distinct Testing Environments: a) GODU Integrated Refrigeration and Storage - GODU LH2; b) GODU Autonomous Control - GODU LO2. Scope: I. GODU LH2: a) Investigate alternative storage and distribution architecture for future cryogenic propellant operations. b) Demonstrate advanced cryogenic propellant handling operations (liquefaction, storage and distribution) of normal boiling point and sub-cooled cryogenic propellants. II. GODU L02: a) Develop and demonstrate advanced control and health management technologies and techniques to autonomously control cryogenic propellant servicing operations. b) Investigate modern COTS hardware and control systems in an effort to reduce the \"standing army\" of engineers associated with maintaining and operating ground systems through the use of health management and autonomous control technologies. Goals: a) Raise Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Integration Readiness Levels (IRL) of several key technology development areas. b) Reduce operations lifecycle costs of future test programs and launch complexes. c) Demonstrate technologies for future exploration beyond low earth orbit. d) Serve as test environments for extraterrestrial surface operations.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130014505, "endDate": "2013-06-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Commercial and Government Respnsive Access to Space Technology Exhibit (CRASTE) 2013", "location": "Bellevue, WA", "id": "c1c5a8a047e8433f823907be4e9712f4", "startDate": "2013-06-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130014505, "id": "27e3849425024692b1839f7973d7607f", "publicationDate": "2013-06-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130014505.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130014505/downloads/20130014505.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130014505/downloads/20130014505.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130014505/downloads/20130014505.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
