Pilgrim4\nVista Photonics Inc., Las Cruces, NM 88001\n\nDuring a successful 2 year technology demonstration of the tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS) based Multi-Gas\nMonitor (MGM) on the International Space Station (ISS), we began discussing with the US Navy the possibility of\nconducting a sea trial of an MGM on a submarine. The sea trial would also include a gas chromatography/differential\nmobility spectrometer based Air Quality Monitor (AQM), which is used operationally on ISS for volatile organic compound\nanalysis. AQM preparation and results will be the subject of a separate paper. The Navy\xe2\x80\x99s interest in testing NASA\nequipment in general relates to their ongoing search for better air monitoring technology. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s goal is studying\nsubmarines as closed environment analogs to spacecraft. MGM\xe2\x80\x99s core technology was developed by Vista Photonics Inc\nusing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants and expanded for various applications using NASA program\nfunding. The MGM measures oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and water vapor in ambient air, displays concentrations\nwith temperature and pressure, and stores 30 second moving averages. The sea trial involves collocating the instrument with\nthe Central Atmosphere Monitoring System (CAMS Mk II) of the submarine, connecting it to rack power prior to departure,\nand letting it run during the entire 90 day patrol. All data is stored within MGM, with no connection to the vessel data bus.\nCrew intervention is limited to checking MGM periodically to see that it is working and power cycling if necessary. After\nthe trial is over, the unit with its data will be retrieved. Post sea trial calibration check and data analysis are planned and\nresults will be compared with both CAMS Mk II data and results from MGM\xe2\x80\x99s ISS technology demonstration. Since the sea\ntrial itself has been delayed, this paper describes the preparation of MGM for the sea trial and also provides a summary of the\nlatest data from the ISS MGM technology demonstration.\n\nNomenclature\nAQM = Air Quality Monitor\nOLGA = Optical Life Gas Analyzer\nCAMS= Central Atmosphere Monitoring System (Mk II)\nppm\n= parts per million\nICES = Int\xe2\x80\x99l Conference on Environmental Systems\nSBIR = Small Business Innovation Research program\nJEM\n= Japanese Experiment Module\nSPHERES = Synchronized Position Hold, Engage,\nJSC\n= Johnson Space Center\nReorient, Experimental Satellites (internal ISS payload)\nMCA = Major Constituents Analyzer\nTDLS = Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy\nMGM = Multi Gas Monitor\nUSB\n= Universal Serial Bus\n________________________________________________\n1\nScientist, Environmental Sciences Branch, SK4, NASA-Johnston Space Center, Houston, TX 77058\n2\nSubmarine Atmosphere Monitoring Engineering, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Code 416, 5001 South Broad St,\nPhiladelphia, PA 19112\n3\nNAVSEA Technical Warrant Holder, Climate Control Systems, Naval Sea Systems Command, 1333 Isaac Hull Ave SE,\nWashington Navy Yard DC 20376\n4\nPresident, Vista Photonics Inc., 4611 Research Park Circle B220, Las Cruces, NM 88001-5948\n\n1\n\n47th International Conference on Environmental Systems\n16-20 July 2017, Charleston, South Carolina\n\nICES-2017-167\n\nIntroduction\nAt past ICES conferences, we reported on the development, ground testing and flight demonstration of a tunable diode laser\nspectroscopy (TDLS) based Multi-Gas Monitor (MGM), which measures oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia\n(NH3) and water (H2O) vapor1-2. The development of the technology traces to Small Business Innovation Research grants to\nVista Photonics Inc of Las Cruces, NM. Originally called Optical Life Gas Analyzer (OLGA), the implementation history of\nMGM is shown pictorially in Figure 1. Each version represents progress in the spectroscopy, hardware, software, data\ndisplay and packaging. One critical focus was on minimizing power draw, with battery power in mind. Power was reduced\nto the point that version 3 runs on 3 Canon camcorder batteries (P/N BP-930). The flight technology demonstration version\nincludes an option to run on 5 imbedded lithium ion polymer (pouch) batteries, although primarily operated on 5V USB\npower in the rack. The final version of MGM is version 2 rebuilt, updated and repackaged into a smaller version 5, with a\nlarger backlit display. This is the version set to undergo a sea trial on a US Navy submarine.\n\nFigure 1. Pictorial history of the development of the Multi-Gas Monitor\nDetails of the technology demonstration of MGM on the International Space Station were previously reported with results of\nthe first year of operation3. MGM has spent 3 years operating on ISS. The timeline starting from the point of MGM\ncalibration on the ground before launch to ISS and ending with recent work to return MGM to ground is provided in Table 1.\nThe tech demo proved successful after 6 months, but was extended out to 2 years. Nearly 2 years of data has already been\ndownlinked, analyzed and reported. During this past year (2016), MGM remained installed in Nanoracks and evidently\npowered on, but no data was downlinked (there was no flight or ground support for the payload since all objectives had been\nachieved). The return of MGM to Earth will allow the technical team to inspect and test the unit, and potentially retrieve a\ntreasure trove of data from this past (3rd) year of operation. In addition, post flight calibration checks will be conducted for all\n4 gases to determine if any drift or aging of the optical cell or lasers has occurred. By the date of ICES 2017, it will be 4\nyears since the unit was calibrated.\n\n2\n\n47th International Conference on Environmental Systems\n16-20 July 2017, Charleston, South Carolina\n\nICES-2017-167\n\nTable 1. Timeline for flight demonstration of the Multi-Gas Monitor (MGM)\n\nExperimental\nAnalytical and physical specifications of the sea trial version of MGM are listed in Table 2. One of the principle advantages\nof the technology is the extremely wide dynamic range\xe2\x80\x942 orders of magnitude or more, if required. The oxygen, carbon\ndioxide and humidity ranges expected on submarine will be easily covered by the MGM. There are several potential sources\nof ammonia on submarines including human respiration and the liquid amine CO2 scrubber. It will be interesting to determine\nif ammonia ever exceeds MGM\xe2\x80\x99s lower detection limit of 5 ppm. Although MGM has quite a small power draw, batteries\nare not needed or wanted for the sea trial version since A/C line power is readily available. On board memory capacity (2\nGB) is more than enough for the 90 day sea trial.\nTable 2.

Their sole duty would be to\ncheck the display periodically (~ weekly) to verify it is running. Mitigation if necessary is limited to power cycling via the\nsingle button. The photo collage of Figure 2 is from the operator\xe2\x80\x99s manual.\n\nFigure 2. Sea trial MGM with power cord/adapter (left). A single button powers it ON/OFF (center).

The display (right)\nreflects the concentrations, temperature, pressure and Nitrogen (N2) by difference, assuming cabin atmospheric\nArgon at 0.9%.\n\nSea Trial Planning\nThe US Navy is pursuing an at-sea trial of the MGM for two purposes. First, the Navy has continuing interest in evaluating\nnew analyzer technologies with the potential for improving atmospheric monitoring capabilities. Secondly, the US Navy is\nalso investigating the use of a distributed atmosphere monitoring system as a primary submarine atmospheric analyzer. The\ndistributed system would utilize a variety of sensors positioned in selected locations to monitor for life gases (O 2, CO2, etc.)\nand trace contaminant gases (CO, refrigerants and other volatile organic compounds) continuously in real time. The MGM,\nAQM, and the technologies they utilize offer potential improvements to atmospheric monitoring currently utilized on\nsubmarines, as well as proven analyzers for use as part of a distributed atmosphere monitoring system. Some of these\npotential improvements include lower limits of detection, the monitoring of additional atmospheric compounds and improved\nsupportability, maintainability and endurance. A significant advantage to utilizing these NASA-developed analyzers is that\nthey have both operated on ISS, which means proper operation of both analyzers has been validated after exposure to the\nphysical stresses associated with transiting to ISS, in additional to operating for an extended period of time with minimal\nadjustments required. This provides additional confidence to the Navy due to their successful operational history in a\nrelevant environment to that of a submarine. The planned at-sea trial onboard a US Navy submarine will further document\nperformance in an operational submarine environment.\nPerforming an at-sea trial of a land-based analyzer has proven to be a successful path to transition a submarine atmosphere\nmonitor. In 2007, the US Navy conducted an 80-day trial of an atmosphere analyzer developed as part of a Navy-sponsored\nSBIR onboard USS Kentucky (SSBN 737)4. This trial confirmed the successful shipboard operation of an optics-based\nanalyzer, and ultimately resulted in the development of a new submarine atmospheric analyzer. In the 2007 at-sea trial, the\nanalyzer of interest was collocated in a shipboard locker next to the CAMS Mk II cabinet, as shown in Figure 3, with a\nflexible line transporting an air sample from the CAMS Mk II outlet to the analyzer under test. The planned approach is\nexpected to be similar for the current trial, however due to a difference in sampling techniques; the MGM may be placed at\nthe normal CAMS Mk II sampling location, to ensure that data recorded from the CAMS Mk II can be utilized for\ncomparison purposes. As stated previously, the intention is to allow the MGM to operate continuously throughout the trial\nwith minimal action required from the crew.\n\n4\n\n47th International Conference on Environmental Systems\n16-20 July 2017, Charleston, South Carolina\n\nICES-2017-167\n\nFigure 3.

Also, the MGM has just returned (3/19/17) from ISS\non SpaceX 10 Dragon capsule, so the final data recovery (Year 3) from the technology demonstration has also not yet\noccurred. Thus, the data presented here is Year 2 of the ISS MGM technology demonstration for comparison purposes.\nMGM data for O2 and CO2 are compared with the central Major Constituents Analyzer (MCA) on ISS, which draws air from\nvarious modules including the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) where MGM resided. This data along with any Year 3\ndata recovered from the ISS MGM will be compared with the sea trial results, which will also be compared more directly\nwith CAMS Mk II data from the submarine. For the majority of the 3 year stay on ISS, MGM was installed in a rack as\nshown in Figure 4 and powered via USB cables connected to the Frame. Gas concentrations and housekeeping data were\ndownlinked roughly weekly at first then became more sporadic. Compressed files were received and analyzed at Johnson\nSpace Center and Vista Photonics. Data trend plots for each gas were updated as often as new data was received. Example\ndata for each gas follows with some discussion.\n\n5\n\n47th International Conference on Environmental Systems\n16-20 July 2017, Charleston, South Carolina\n\nICES-2017-167\n\nFigure 4.

Gaps in the data set were due to USB connectivity issues, not the MGM itself. Note the 2 sets of\ndata compare very well. MGM has the advantage of not needing the periodic recalibration that MCA requires.\n\nFigure 5.

The 2 sets also track each other very well.\nFigure 7 is a zoomed in region of Figure 6, showing the diurnal fluctuations in CO2 concentration, and about a 1 month\ninterval where CO2 concentrations were intentionally kept well below operational requirements.\nMCA\nMGM\n\n5.0\n4.5\n\nCO2 (mmHg)\n\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n\n15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15\n/20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20 /20\n1/1 1/22 2/12 3/5 3/26 4/16 5/7 5/28 6/18 7/9 7/30 8/20 9/10 10/1 0/22 1/12\n1\n1\n\nFigure 6. CO2 results in mmHg partial pressure from MGM compared to MCA.\n\nFigure 7. Region clearly showing the day/night cycles in CO2 concentration.\nHumidity\nThe MGM makes direct measurements of water vapor in ppm. On ISS, there is no real \xe2\x80\x9cgold standard\xe2\x80\x9d measurement of\nhumidity to compare against MGM, but there are experimental relative humidity sensors in the JEM and Columbus. Except\nfor occasional spikes, MGM found water vapor to be fairly constant ~12,000 ppm in the ISS in a comfortable, habitable range\n\n7\n\n47th International Conference on Environmental Systems\n16-20 July 2017, Charleston, South Carolina\n\nICES-2017-167\n\ncorresponding to about 38% relative humidity. Figure 8 shows the data for the last year of MGM operation. Each of the\nspikes in water vapor correspond to dry out cycling of the JEM condensing heat exchangers, a regular part of maintenance.\n\nFigure 8. Water vapor measured by MGM is fairly constant around 12,000 ppm. The spikes are attributed to dry out\ncycling of the JEM condensing heat exchangers.\nAmmonia\nNormally, ammonia in the ISS atmosphere is low and well controlled. The primary source is the crew. However, there is a\nsmall potential for a leak from the external high pressure ammonia thermal control system into the internal water cooling\nloops and out into the cabin. Hence the interest in monitoring ammonia. Gaps in the plots are from interface issues with the\nrack frame. Except for a brief test of the ammonia channel by the crew using an inhalant in 2014, MGM did not detect\nammonia above ~ 5 ppm baseline noise as shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9. Ammonia as measured by MGM is normally always < 5 ppm, which is the formal low detection limit.\n\n8\n\n47th International Conference on Environmental Systems\n16-20 July 2017, Charleston, South Carolina\n\nICES-2017-167\n\nThe last set of MGM data from the ISS MGM was downlinked in January 2016 at the point that ground and flight operations\nsupport for the MGM tech demo was essentially terminated. We had been getting sporadic data down due to intermittent\nUSB connectivity issues with the Frame. The plots of Figure 10 show nominal levels of O2, CO2, water vapor, and cabin\natmospheric pressure around a nominal ~ 750 Torr (750 mm Hg). The temperature displayed (~ 29C) is internal MGM\ntemperature which is about 5C warmer than the ambient cabin. The solid line in each graph represents gaps in the data sets.\n\nConclusions & Future Directions\nThe Multi-Gas Monitor\xe2\x80\x99s core tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS) technology was demonstrated on International Space\nStation to be rock solid, with a calibration interval longer than 3 years and accuracy that rivals any of the current\ninstrumentation. We anticipate the MGM sea trial data when compared with CAMS Mk II results will show similar results.\nWe anticipate interesting and perhaps similar comparisons between the closed environment of a submarine and that of a\nspacecraft. Beyond life gases, TDLS is being expanded to cover combustion products including carbon monoxide, hydrogen\ncyanide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride for a total of 8 gases in an enclosure of the same footprint and low power\ndraw as MGM for a battery powered configuration. The future for TDLS based hand held life gas and emergency gas\nmonitors in spacecraft and submarines looks very bright indeed.\n\nFigure 10.
