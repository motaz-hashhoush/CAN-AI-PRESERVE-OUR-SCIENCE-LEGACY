However, SLS also\nfaces unique challenges.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This presentation will address the SLS challenges,\nalong with the analysis and decisions to mitigate the\nthreats posed by each.\n2\n\nDesign Architecture\n\n3\n\nTraditional Approach for \xe2\x80\x9cLogistics\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Concepts and processes of Integrated Logistics\nSupport (ILS) provide a significant opportunity to\nminimize life cycle cost of ownership of a system.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Traditional application of ILS during the design,\ndevelopment, test and evaluation (DDT&E) of a\nsystem typically consists of two different, but highly\nrelated processes:\n\xc2\x83 Designing a supportable system.\n\xc2\x83 Developing a reasonable, responsive and cost effective\n4\nsupport solution.\n\nILS During System Development\n\n5\n\nTailoring ILS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A simple comparison of traditional ILS concepts and\nprocesses with the unique circumstances of the\nSLS Program (SLSP) indicates that application of\nILS must be drastically different to be effective.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SLSP is performing a comprehensive, but nontraditional ILS program that will contribute to the\nprogram goals.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Specific details of SLS challenges and ILS tailoring\nare addressed in the remaining charts\n6\n\nSupply Chain Impacts Due to Multiple Projects, Contractors,\nand Vendors\n\n7\n\nNASA SLS Common Challenges and Threats\nChallenge\n\nThreat\n\nIntegration of multiple\ngeographically separated\nprograms\n\nStakeholder communication,\nconflicting schedules, lack of\ncommonality, gaps in\nrequirements and funding\n\nIntegration of multiple\ngeographically separated projects\nwithin a program and multiple\ncontactors\n\nStakeholder communication,\nconflicting & complex schedules,\nlack of commonality, gaps in\nrequirements, different goals, lack\nof flowed down requirements\n\nFunding constraints\n\nIncreased risk\n\n8\n\nNASA SLS Unique Challenges and Threats\nChallenge\n\nThreat\n\nLow manifest rates and\nfrequencies (Up to four years\napart)\nArchitecture Block upgrade\napproach\n\nCostly logistics solutions,\nincreased risk for availability of\nskilled personnel resources\nDelay for operational phase,\nincreased cost for changing\nsupport solutions: LSA,\nresources, sparing philosophy\nObsolescence, parts marking,\ncommonality\nLimited personnel resources,\ndesign interface issues\n\nMixed new and heritage\nhardware\nMultiple projects (elements)\nwith individual milestone\nreviews\nDictated flat funding\nIncreased risk for adequate\nconstraints, no inflation allowed logistics support\n\n9\n\nNASA SLS Common Threats and Analysis\nThreat\n\nAnalysis/Activities\n\nMultiple Programs: Stakeholder\ncommunication, conflicting\nschedules, lack of commonality,\ngaps in funding.\nMultiple Projects: Stakeholder\ncommunication, conflicting\nschedules, lack of commonality.\n\nCross-Program Logistics Integration\nTeam (LIT) established to provide\ncommunication and work\nconcerns/issues\nSLSP ILS Team established for\nintegration of Elements\xe2\x80\x99 schedules,\ndata, and analysis.\n\nMultiple prime contractors: Different\ngoals, lack of flowed down\nrequirements.\nSchedules: Conflicts, complexity.\n\nContractors included in SLSP ILS Team\nactivities, tailored Data Requirements\nDescriptions (DRDs) implemented.\nSLS Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)\nestablished with inter-relationships.\nLogistics Support Date (LSD) concept\nimplemented.\nImplemented engineering bottoms-up\nlife cycle cost (LCC) and identified\nprogram risks for mitigation.\n\nFunding: Increased risk.\n\n10\n\nNASA SLS Unique Threats and Analysis\nThreat\n\nAnalysis/Activities\n\nLow manifest rates: Costly logistics\nsolutions, increased risk for\navailability of skilled personnel\nresources.\nBlock upgrade approach: Delay for\noperational phase, increased cost\nfor changing support solutions:\nLSA, resources, sparing philosophy.\nHardware: Obsolescence, parts\nmarking, commonality.\n\nMinimal approach for first two flights\n(2017 & 2021).
