Satisfactory surface qualities and excellent yield of silicon wafers were found. One drawback is that the add-on cost of producing water from this saw, as presently used, is considerably higher than other systems being developed for the low-cost silicon solar array project (LSSA), primarily because the saw uses a large quantity of wire. The add-on cost can be significantly reduced by extending the wire life and/or by rescue of properly plated wire to restore the diameter.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780012677, "id": "8485dcc5ca48423794eb7bb597c00666", "publicationDate": "1978-02-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780012677.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780012677/downloads/19780012677.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780012677/downloads/19780012677.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780012677/downloads/19780012677.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
