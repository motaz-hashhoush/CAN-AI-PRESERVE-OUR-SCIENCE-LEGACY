b"THE SPACE STATION\nAbraham Munoz\nConceived since the beginning of time, living in space is no longer a dream but\nrather a very near reality. In times and civilizations past man could only dream of the\nvastness of space. No longer is man restricted to land and sea, he has found a new\nfrontier to extend himself to. In his quest to explore this new realm, man must possess\nthe greatest of knowledge and use it well. Although much time will elapse, space will\nsuccumb to another master.\nAmerica's space program rose from an advisory committee, National Advisory\nCommission on Aeronautics] to a supreme aerospace organization, National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Many great projects and moments are now under\nAmerica's belt, but many more are yet to come. NASA's newest challenge was well\ndescribed by our great president, Ronald Reagan, in his State of the Union Message\non January 5, 1984.\nWe can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in\nspace for peaceful economic and scientific gain. Tonight, I am directing\nNASA to develop a permanently manned Space Station and to do it\nwithin a decade.\nA Space Station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science, communications and in metals and life-saving medicines which\ncan be manufactured only in space.\nThis conception is not a new one, but a redefined one. In the early seventies\nSkylab represented an early and successful configuration of space stations to come.\nNASA learned a great deal from this project. Much of what it learned, ranging from\nhuman behavior in space to experiments in space, will be very useful to this next generation of space stations.\nIn order to meet its deadline of ten years (although it's hoping to do the job in\neight years in commemoration of Columbus' 500th anniversary of the discovery of the\nNew World) NASA and its contractors are constantly working to develop the design of\nthe Space Station that is due sometime in 1987. Many investigations on the kinds of\nexperiments and work assignments the Space Station will need to accommodate have\nbeen completed, but NASA specialists are constantly talking with potential users of the\nStation to learn more about the work they, the users, want to do in space.\nAs presently proposed, the core of the Space Station will consist of six or seven\nmodules, cylinders of approximately 14 ft in diameter by 24 ft long (see figure l).One\nof these modules will be used by the European Space Agency, ESA, and another by\nJapan. The remainder, of course, will be used by the United States. They will be\ndesigned and arranged so that newer and more sophisticated modules can be added\nin the future. The Space Station will grow as its importance grows. Each module will\n\nbe pressurized to a normal human level and will contain its supply of necessary oxygen. They will be connected by hubs (see figure 1). These hubs will permit easy\nmobility between modules and are the connection areas for future modules.\nOne of these modules will house the crew on board the Station. Separate living\nquarters will be provided for each astronaut. Although astronauts don't need beds in\nspace, for they float in zero-gravity, they do need straps to hold them in place. They\nwill substitute vertical sleeping bags for the regular horizontal beds. These quarters\nwill be private and personal areas for the astronauts to retreat to. Designed to serve\nas a home away from home, the Space Station will be a home to between six and\neight people. Each crew will be in space for approximately 90 days. At the end of the\n90 days a new crew will come up from Earth on the shuttle to replace the previous\ncrew. Within each crew half of the members will work one shift while the other half\nsleeps. This rotation system will allow for more room, around the clock personnel, and\nless fatigue on the station. From past experience, data taken from Skylab and information released from the Soviet space stations Salyut and Mir, it has been obvious\nthat workers in space become homesick. They miss their families, friends, food, sights,\nand sounds which they were accustomed to on Earth. In order to solve this problem,\npersonal photos and items are to be allowed in each crew member's sleeping quarters. Daily phone calls to family members will be available. Because bird chirping, the\nblowing of wind and other natural sounds are obvious Earth sounds, they are being\nproposed to be played on board the station at a subliminal level so they can be picked\nup by the subconscious mind, thus creating an artificial Earth-sounding environment.\nViewing our planet, as told by former astronauts, is such a spirit-lifting experience that\nwindows will be strategically placed to provide this pleasure. Providing a home-like\natmosphere for people in space will increase morale and productivity.\nTwo other modules are scientific laboratories. They will be used to carry out\nexperiments which can only be done in space or experiments which benefit from zerogravity. In these labs basic research in medicine, astronomy, space physics and other\nfields will be carried out. These studies will be aimed at developing useful services\nand products for industrial customers and users. These labs will serve as national\nlaboratories upon which our nation can depend for economic and social well-being in\nan increasingly competitive and sophisticated world. Another module will serve as a\nlogistics unit, primarily a supply module. All necessary supplies required for a threemonth stay in space will be kept here. This will keep the other modules free from any\nsupplies that shouldn't be there. One other module will serve as a berthing dock for\nthe Space Shuttle. Being that the shuttle is the only transportation vehicle between\nthe Space Station and Earth there must be an area in which to park the shuttle. It will\nbe through the Space Shuttle that the new crews and supplies will be brought up at\nthe end of each three-month period. In case of an emergency the shuttle will be sent\nto respond to the incident. Also in one of these modules a kitchen and an exercise\nroom will be located.\nThese modules will be connected to large trusses (see figure 1 ) . Extending\naway from the modules will be two sets of large solar panels which will generate\nenough energy from the sun to provide the necessary power for the entire complex.\nGliding along the trusses will be a remote controlled robot arm. This manipulation unit\nwill allow for easy on-board repairs of the station and quick structure relocations.\n\n64\n\nAlthough much of the work which will be done on the station will be directed by the\ncrew itself, continual communication linkage between ground control and the station is\nrequired. A dish antenna on the station will connect both parties.\nEach part of the Space Station will be carried separately on the space shuttles.\nThen as each part arrives in space it will be connected to the previous structure which\nis already in space. The trusses and solar panels will be the first items to be launched.\nDuring the fifth or sixth shuttle launch the first module is expected to go up. The module will go up as a single unit so that it can easily be connected to the other structures\nalready intact. It is during these next few launches that the Space Station will become\nhabitable by our astronauts. The remaining parts of the Space Station will continue to\ngo up as soon as possible and on schedule if all goes well. Between 14 and\n17 launches are expected in order to complete the station which will be 250 miles\nabove the Earth's equator.\nOnce the station becomes operational America will begin to reap the harvest of\nits work. Space does not limit itself to one field. Commercial uses in space are limitless. First and foremost, many satellites near low-Earth orbit will be in need of repair.\nUsing the Manned Maneuvering Units, MMUs, astronauts from the Space Station can\neasily repair the satellites. The cost to the customer will be substantially less than if he\nwere to have replaced the satellite. Also, the space telescope, which is planned to be\nlaunched as soon as the Space Shuttle becomes operational, will need tending.\nMuch knowledge about deep space will be gathered from this instrument, and for this\nreason it must be kept operational at all times. The research being done on the Space\nStation cannot be put aside. This research will greatly aid those people, industry, who\ninvest in it. This in turn will benefit our entire society.\nAs important as the research going on in space, will be the future manned and\nunmanned voyages which will use the Space Station as a port. From here the United\nStates of America can commence plans for building a lunar base. All the necessary\nmaterial would be sent to the station and from there on to the moon. A lunar base has\nmany uses and will benefit from having the Space Station at its disposal. During this\nsame time period, between 2000-2010, a manned mission to Mars would become\nmore attractive. By assembling the spacecraft in orbit and launching it there, it will not\nneed to be equipped for a strenuous passage through the Earth's atmosphere.\nInstead, it can be constructed entirely for use in the vacuum of space with resulting\ndesign and economical advantages. The trip to Mars and a Martian base would be\nmankind's next giant leap in his quest to increase his knowledge of the universe.\n\nMaintaining U.S. Leadership in space, studying the Earth's resources, developing new manufacturing and processing techniques, basic science and technology\nresearch, and becoming a port for future interplanetary voyages is the purpose of this\neight billion dollar Space Station. For 20 years after it's completed (this is the life\nexpectancy of the station) the Space Station will serve as a symbol of national pride\nand honor. It will kindle our imagination and creativity. It will inspire America's youth\nto reach for greater achievements, and hopefully will inspire them to seek professions\nin space-related fields. Within those 20 years the Space Station may become obsolete as a better breed of space stations emerges. But one thing remains for certain,\n\n65\n\nand that's that this Space Station will be the Pinta, the Nina, and the Santa Maria\nembarking on a trip to explore the new world of space.\n\n66\n\nVH KO93\n\nSOL\n\nFigure 1.- Features of the Space Station.\n\n67\n\n"
