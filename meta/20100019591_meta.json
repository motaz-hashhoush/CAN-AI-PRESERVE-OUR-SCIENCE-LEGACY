This program represents an integration of many technologies into a single application to facilitate schedule sharing and management. It is a Windows-based application developed in Visual Basic. Because the NASA standard office automation load environment is Microsoft-based, Visual Basic provides AO SS developers with the ability to interact with Windows collaboration components by accessing objects models from applications like Outlook and Excel. This also gives developers the ability to create newly customizable components that perform specialized tasks pertaining to scheduling reporting inside the application. With this capability, AOSS can perform various asynchronous tasks, such as gathering/ sending/ managing astronauts schedule information directly to their Outlook calendars at any time.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100019591, "id": "c1ddaf93a95b42aa88cbd95ff2af59d3", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, May 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20100019580, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, May 2010", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100019591.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100019591/downloads/20100019591.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100019591/downloads/20100019591.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100019591/downloads/20100019591.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
