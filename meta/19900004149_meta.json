Several laser based receivers are now part of the instrument complement flown aboard the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. Lasers are eminently practical as FIR local oscillators whenever there is close frequency coincidence between a strong laser transition and the Doppler-shifted astronomical line. While it is desirable to have continuous frequency coverage in a spectrometer, it should be recognized that most astronomers will focus their interest on the few spectral lines deemed optimum for probing the cosmos. Ultimately, the development of a reliable thin film technology for the new high temperature oxide superconductors may favor SIS-type devices for all wavelengths in future space based FIR receivers.", "title": "Far-infrared heterodyne receivers", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:58:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900004149, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Betz, Albert"}, "organization": {"name": "California Univ.", "location": "Berkeley, CA, United States"}}, "id": "412bb65ba7b445128441a0aaded138de"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900004149, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900004149, "id": "940604116f9b4ac89a95b0f533ef38cc", "publicationName": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech., Report of the Asilomar 3 LDR Workshop", "publicationDate": "1988-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900004149.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900004149/downloads/19900004149.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900004149/downloads/19900004149.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900004149/downloads/19900004149.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
