This technique\nfeatures compatibility with vacuum bakeout procedures and temperature, conformability to curved\nsurfaces, applicability to large areas, use of ordinary\ntooling procedures, and economy of manufacturing\noperations.\nTo remove tube size limitations and permit economical fabrication, low-cost siloxane resin formulations containing particulate or dissolved materials\nsubstitute for expensive thin glass filters and fluorescent glasses previously,employed. The resins contain\nsufficient methyl or phenyl groups for solubility in\norganic solvents. After vaporizing the solvent, a short\nbaking cycle drives off the organic groups, leaving a\npolymerized material stable under vacuum and under\n'the temperatures required for tube fabrication.\nThe fabrication method provides for low diffuse\nreflectance of ambient light. Employing nonreciprocal\nfiltering overcomes objections to earlier approaches\nor applications involving high ambient illumination\nvels, such as in aircraft cockpits.\n\nThe cathode ray tube face consists of a layer of\nultraviolet emitting phosphor upon which the electron\nbeam impinges; a second layer of shortwave bandpass\nfilter material to transmit this energy; a third layer of\nfluorescent material that converts the short wavelength energy into visible energy; and a final layer\nconsisting.of a longwave bandpass filter which transmits this visible energy, while simultaneously blocking\nshortwave energy which could stimulate the fluorescent layer. Since the two filters have no mutual bandpass, no ambient energy can reach the phosphor layer\nto be reflected with concomitant reduction in the\ncontrast of imagery displayed on the tube face. The\ntube face appears black except where information is\nbeing presented.\nAn embodiment of the invention is shown in the\ndrawing. The tube face serves as a substrate upon\nwhich several layers are deposited. Powdered fluorescent glass in a glass resin carrier comprises the fluorescent layer. After applying the formulation and\ndrying to obtain a thickness of 3 to 10 mils, baking\nthe coating polymerizes the resin. The fluorescent\nglass used must have reasonable conversion efficiency\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

This requirement eliminates the need of matching refractive indices, since the broadening due to refraction in thin\nlayers is negligible here.\nA thin film of magnesium fluoride is evaporated\non the front surface to reduce further the ambient\nillumination.\n\nBrief 70-10454\t\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nHeadquarters\nNational Aeronautics\nand Space Administration\nWashington, D.C. 20546\nReference: TSP70- 10454\n\nPatent status:\nInquiries about obtaining rights for the commercial\nuse of this invention may be made to NASA, Code\nGP, Washington, D.C. 20546.\nSource: E.
