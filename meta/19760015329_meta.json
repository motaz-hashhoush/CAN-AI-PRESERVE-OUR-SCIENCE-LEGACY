The unit is a spacecraft-qualifiable, prototype, parametric amplifier for eventual application in the shuttle orbiter. The amplifier was required to have a noise temperature of less than 150 K. A noise temperature of less than 120 K at a gain level of 17 db was achieved. A 3-db bandwidth in excess of 350 MHz was attained, while deviation from phase linearity of about + or - 1 degree over 50 MHz was achieved. The paramp operates within specification over an ambient temperature range of -5 C to +50 C. The performance requirements and the operation of the K sub u-band parametric amplifier system are described. The final test results are also given.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760015329, "id": "3360fedeafab4c4f97274966ced33b2f", "publicationDate": "1976-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760015329.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760015329/downloads/19760015329.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760015329/downloads/19760015329.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760015329/downloads/19760015329.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
