All the fluid mechanics data available from the Skylab missions were identified and surveyed. The significant fluid mechanics phenomena were identified and reduced to measurable quantities wherever possible. Data correlations were performed using existing theories. Among the phenomena analyzed were: static low-g interface shapes, oscillation frequency and damping of a liquid drop, coalescence, rotating drop, liquid films and low-g ice melting. A survey of the possible applications of the results was made and future experiments are recommended.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750015816, "id": "f178e873617c47779ce7588bbe77d782", "publicationDate": "1975-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19750015816.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19750015816/downloads/19750015816.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19750015816/downloads/19750015816.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19750015816/downloads/19750015816.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
