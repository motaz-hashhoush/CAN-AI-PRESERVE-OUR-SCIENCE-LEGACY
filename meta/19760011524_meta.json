Results of testing the CP program indicate that the best results can be obtained in the near infrared water bands. The absorption due to water vapor and carbon dioxide in the thermal infrared band appeared to be less reliable in comparison to spacecraft-acquired data and band models. Comparisons of laboratory carbon dioxide transmission in the thermal infrared band show good agreement except in regions where lines are known to be missing. The comparison of ozone transmission at a wavelength of 9.6 micrometers to laboratory data showed unexceptedly large differences.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760011524, "id": "f59bad06d7a2425caa39933fbd29cc85", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760011524.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760011524/downloads/19760011524.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760011524/downloads/19760011524.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760011524/downloads/19760011524.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
