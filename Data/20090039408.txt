b'Insulating Foams Save Money, Increase Safety\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nR\n\nesearchers at the Advanced Materials and\nProcessing Branch at Langley Research Center\ncreated a superior polyimide foam as insulation\nfor reusable cryogenic propellant tanks on the space\nshuttle. At the time, the foam insulation on the tanks had\na limited lifetime: one launch, which did not suit NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nneed for reusable launch systems.\nThe foam on the shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s external tanks needed to\ninsulate the super-cooled liquid propellant, preventing\nice from forming on the tanks and surrounding areas\nand posing catastrophic risk from debris during launch.\nThe insulation also needed to be able to withstand the\nhigh temperatures that the tanks would experience during\nignition and launch. The researchers named their new\nfoam TEEK.\nA partnership with a small business in Florida improved\nthe chemical structure of the NASA-developed foam,\nleading to a new product, FPF-44 with commercial applications in the boat-building business, as well as further\napplications within the Space Program. The partnership\nalso earned NASA scientists, Roberto J. Cano, Brian J.\nJensen, and Erik S. Weiser, as well as their industry counterpart, Juan Miguel Vazquez, the coveted designation of\n\xe2\x80\x9cNASA Commercial Invention of the Year.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPartnership\nA small Hialeah, Florida-based business, PolyuMAC\nInc., was looking for advanced foams to use in the\ncustomized manufacturing of acoustical and thermal\ninsulation. PolyuMAC is a state-of-the-art manufacturer\nof foams for use in the marine industry. One of the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s customers had requested newer, advanced\nmaterials for use on U.S. Navy ships. The goal, then, was\nto find an advanced, insulating material\xe2\x80\x94lighter weight,\nmanufacturable in-house, easy to work with, increased\ninsulating capabilities, and affordable. The hunt was on\nfor better foam.\n54\t\n\nTransportation \t\n\nDuring this search, Juan Miguel Vazquez, new product development lead as well as founder and president\nof PolyuMAC, came across information about the\nTEEK foam developed at Langley. Vazquez read about\nTEEK and contacted Langley for samples and technical\ndata sheets.\nHe reviewed the materials and began his own testing,\ninvestigating the foam\xe2\x80\x99s properties. He determined, however, that TEEK was not the right density for his needed\napplications, and furthermore, producing the material\nin the large quantities he needed would have been costprohibitive. Rather than dismiss the endeavor altogether,\nthough, he contacted the inventors and asked for help\ntweaking the TEEK chemistry to bring it more in line\nwith his company\xe2\x80\x99s needs. They agreed, and he licensed\nthe foam from NASA to begin the modifications. After\nmultiple visits between the company\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory and the\nNASA field center, the researchers had made the foam\nlighter in weight and cheaper to produce. They named\nthis new generation of foam FPF-44, and the patent is\nnow held by the three Langley scientists and Vazquez.\nNASA tested FPF-44 at the White Sands Test Facility,\na rocket test site in the dunes of New Mexico operated\nby the Johnson Space Center. There, scientists simulated\nlaunch facility conditions to test for ice mitigation on the\nliquid oxygen feedline on the space shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s external fuel\ntank. The specific goal was to prove that FPF-44 was a\nviable option for addressing a chief safety concern\xe2\x80\x94a gap\nbetween the liquid oxygen feedline and the external tank\nsupport brackets, which is exposed to cryogenic temperatures, allowing moisture to collect on the oxygen tank and\nturn to ice. During tanking, de-tanking, and launch, the\nfeedline articulates, opening and closing the small gap.\nThe insulation needed to be flexible to allow for the\narticulation of the exposed metal parts to prevent ice from\nforming. The Langley-PolyuMAC team thermal-formed\nthe foam into the exact shape needed for that gap, with\nadded flexibility to keep it in place and prevent damage\nwhen the feedline moved. The success of this test makes it\n\nEngineers at Langley Research Center developed insulating\nfoam for the space shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s external fuel tanks.\n\na candidate for future shuttle applications and insulation\non next-generation space vehicles. The NASA-PolyuMAC\nteam is continuing to collaborate on the foam, trying to\nfurther reduce density while maintaining its insulating\nproperties. Future applications could include the next\ngeneration of commercial aircraft. Commercial aircraft,\nwhich currently use fiberglass as an acoustic sound\nabsorber, could perhaps benefit from the next-generation\nfoam, since it has improved handle-ability while providing\nthe same\xe2\x80\x94if not improved\xe2\x80\x94insulating qualities. The test\nwill be if the scientists can lower the density of the foam\nenough to make it a compelling alternative and if they can\ndevelop manufacturing processes capable of accommodating\nthe scale and quantity necessary to infiltrate the large\ncommercial aircraft industry.\nSpinoff 2009\n\nProduct Outcome\nCommercial production of the joint NASA-PolyuMAC\nfoam began in summer 2007, with the company marketing the foam under the trade name Polyshield. The\ncommercialized version offers the same qualities as the\nNASA next-generation, high performance, flexible polyimide foam, and shows promise for use on watercraft,\naircraft, spacecraft, electronics and electrical products,\nautomobiles and automotive products, recreation equipment, and building and construction materials.\nConsumers appreciate its flame retardant qualities,\nthermal insulation and acoustic insulation factors, and\nthe weight reduction it provides, but the chief advantage\nPolyshield has over the TEEK foam is that it is roughly\none-fifth the cost to manufacture. The durable polyimide\n\nfoam is formed at room temperature and then cured using\nlarge microwaves, which reduces costs and increases the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s production rates. The finished product can be\nflexible or rigid, structural or non-structural, and is always\nhighly durable. This affordable insulating foam can also\nbe applied to gaskets and seals, vibration damping pads,\nspacers in adhesives and sealants, extenders, and flowleveling aids.\nThe products provide excellent insulation for sound,\ncryogenics, and heat, and can be used for fire protection.\nIn fact, one of the chief advantages of this material is\nthat, while it holds at very high temperatures, if it does\n\nburn, it will not produce smoke or harmful byproducts, a\ncritical concern on boats, submarines, airplanes, and other\ncontained environments.\nWhile the company has the capacity to thermal-form\nthe material into any shape required by clients, it typically\nprovides sheets of the foam to customers, who then cut\nand shape it as needed for their specific applications. The\nuser can then cover it with various cloths. PolyuMAC\nwill, on demand, make specially fitted shapes, and densities can be tailored according to the intended use. v\t\n\nThe commercial Polyshield foam is flexible, flame-retardant, and provides excellent thermal and acoustical insulating properties.\n\nSpinoff 2009\t\n\nTransportation \t 55\n\n'
