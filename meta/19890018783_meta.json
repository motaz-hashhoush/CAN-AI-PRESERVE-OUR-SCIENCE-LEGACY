The first two working models were dropped from a Wallops aircraft, to test the mechanical integrity and to test the ability of the whole system to withstand the drop and provide usable data. There are two temperature sensors on board, one to measure sea surface temperature and the other to measure air temperature. An onboard computer controls the transmissions, sending three water temperature readings for each air temperature reading in order to differentiate one from the other after data reduction. Guidelines for the development and test of optical drifting buoys include: air deployable and expendable, reasonable cost for multiple deployment, 1 year lifetime, use of existing technology and a minimal validation parameter set.", "title": "Ocean Drifter Project", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T00:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890018783, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mason, C.
