The strong and specific induction of flagellar-coding genes during flagellar regeneration in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii suggests that transcriptional profiling of such cells would reveal new flagella-related genes. We have conducted a genome-wide analysis of RNA transcript levels during flagellar regeneration in Chlamydomonas by using maskless photolithography method-produced DNA oligonucleotide microarrays with unique probe sequences for all exons of the 19,803 predicted genes. This analysis represents previously uncharacterized whole-genome transcriptional activity profiling study in this important model organism. Analysis of strongly induced genes reveals a large set of known flagellar components and also identifies a number of important disease-related proteins as being involved with cilia and flagella, including the zebrafish polycystic kidney genes Qilin, Reptin, and Pontin, as well as the testis-expressed tubby-like protein TULP2.", "title": "Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of flagellar regeneration in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii identifies orthologs of ciliary disease genes", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T04:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050164249, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stolc, Viktor"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA United States"}}, "id": "1491dc16bc3c4867993f895c5956a7b7"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20050164249, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Samanta, Manoj Pratim"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "202163d9567246caa1993280b195022c"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20050164249, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tongprasit, Waraporn"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "718bb014a07b4792a05ffeb9bf88e7df"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 20050164249, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Marshall, Wallace F."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "fcb3115664984ad7b7a71531c1a246c2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050164249, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1073/pnas.0408358102", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "102", "submissionId": 20050164249, "issue": "10", "issn": "0027-8424", "id": "694572ffdc7e47bd8f3916b78d5630d6", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "publicationDate": "2005-03-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
