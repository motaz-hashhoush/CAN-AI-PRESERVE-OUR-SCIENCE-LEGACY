It defines the specific\nprovisions required to design a battery that is safe for ground personnel and crew\nmembers to handle and/or operate during all applicable phases of crewed missions,\nsafe for use in the enclosed environment of a crewed space vehicle, and safe for use in\nlaunch vehicles, as well as in unpressurized spaces adjacent to the habitable portion of\na space vehicle. The required provisions encompass hazard controls, design\nevaluation, and verification. The extent of the hazard controls and verification required\ndepends on the applicability and credibility of the hazard to the specific battery design\nand applicable missions under review. Evaluation of the design and verification\nprogram results shall be completed prior to certification for flight and ground operations.\nThis requirements document is geared toward the designers of battery systems to be\nused in crewed vehicles, crew equipment, crew suits, or batteries to be used in crewed\nvehicle systems and payloads (or experiments). This requirements document also\napplies to ground handling and testing of flight batteries. Specific design and\nverification requirements for a battery are dependent upon the battery chemistry,\ncapacity, complexity, charging, environment, and application. The variety of battery\nchemistries available, combined with the variety of battery-powered applications, results\nin each battery application having specific, unique requirements pertinent to the specific\nbattery application. However, there are basic requirements for all battery designs and\napplications, which are listed in section 4. Section 5 includes a description of hazards\nand controls and also includes requirements.\nThe following definitions differentiate between requirements and other statements.\nShall:\nThis is the only verb used for binding requirements.\nShould/May: These verbs are used for stating non-mandatory goals or when used in\nthe italicized text herein refer to best practice methods which can be\nconstrued as example methods for meeting the requirement it refers to.\nWill:\nThis verb is used for stating facts or declaration of purpose.\nSection 6 includes chemistry-specific information. No requirements appear in that section,\nonly best practices.\n1\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\nShall requirements are summarized in Appendix E.\nIn keeping with the NASA standards template, italicized text is intended to indicate\nrationale, best practice examples, or guidelines; while the italicized text never includes the\nrequirement, it often helps to convey the intent of the requirement.\nIn cases where a requirement includes associated italicized text and that text includes best\npractice, that best practice can be considered part of an accepted means to address the\nrequirement. If other methods are used, rationale and supporting data demonstrating the\nadequacy of those methods should be presented and must be reviewed for adequacy by\nthe program\xe2\x80\x99s technical team.\n1.2\n\nResponsibility and Change Authority\n\nThe responsibility for the development of this document lies with the Propulsion and\nPower Division at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). Change authority resides with\nthe Propulsion and Power Division.\n1.3\n\nBattery Design Evaluation and Approval\n\nTo be compliant to the requirements herein, every battery design, along with its safety\nverification program, its ground and/or on-orbit usage plans, and its post-flight\nprocessing shall be evaluated and approved by the appropriate technical review panel\nin the given program or project. Center and program specific examples of the review\nand approval process can be found in Appendix D.\n\n2\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

The\nfollowing section addresses the prescribed strategies: failure tolerance and Design for\nMinimum Risk (DFMR).\n4.1.1 Failure Tolerance\nFailure tolerance is the basis of the NASA safety approach. This method is applied in\nall safety evaluations unless it can be proven that a failure tolerance approach is not\nfeasible.\na. Battery systems for crewed spacecraft shall implement failure tolerance as the\npreferred approach to control all catastrophic hazard causes.\nb. The level of failure tolerance shall be the product of an integrated design and\nsafety analysis but be a minimum of one.\nAs an example, to be considered two-fault tolerant, a battery design should be capable\nof maintaining safe operation or incur a safe shutdown after the imposition of the failure\nof any two mutually independent catastrophic hazard control measures or features.\nFor the purposes of fault tolerance discussions, NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR)\n8705.2B, \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Rating Requirements and Guidelines for Space Flight Systems,\xe2\x80\x9d\ndefines \xe2\x80\x9ccatastrophic event\xe2\x80\x9d as one resulting in the death or permanent disability of a\ncrew member or passenger or an event resulting in the unplanned loss/destruction of a\nmajor element of the crewed space system during the mission that could potentially\nresult in the death or permanent disability of a crew member or passenger.\nFault tolerance for batteries should consider the toxicity as well as the energy content.\nThis takes into consideration the causes resulting in leakage, rupture, electrical shock,\nfire, and explosion hazards.\nNote that SSP 30309 provides the requirements for the safety analysis and risk\nassessment for the ISS.\n4.1.2 Design for Minimum Risk (DFMR)\nSome potentially catastrophic hazards cannot practically be controlled using failure\ntolerance and are exempted from the tolerance requirement provided the risk they pose\nis mitigated to the maximum practical extent through a defined process in which\n13\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\napproved standards and margins are implemented to account for the absence of failure\ntolerance. Herein, this process is called DFMR.\na. The DFMR approach shall be used to address catastrophic battery hazards that\ncannot practically be controlled by a failure tolerance approach.\nNPR 8705.2B, \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Rating Requirements and Guidelines for Space Flight Systems,\xe2\x80\x9d\nrecognizes that some potentially catastrophic hazards cannot be practically controlled\nusing failure tolerance and are exempted from the tolerance requirement provided they\nare controlled through a defined process in which approved standards and margins are\nimplemented to account for the absence of failure tolerance. Herein, this process is\ncalled DFMR.\nDFMR is a process that relies on the application of mature/proven technology, robust\ndesign margins, and accepted standards for manufacturing, inspection, analysis, test,\nand operational measures to mitigate the potential for failures that cannot be controlled\nby failure tolerance. When a DFMR approach is used, technical authorities accept that\nthe process has demonstrated the risk of catastrophic hazards has been minimized to\nthe maximum practical extent.\nA risk matrix may be used to demonstrate that the applied methods have reduced the\nprobability of occurrence and/or the severity of the hazards to an acceptable level for\nthe intended use.\nThis approach to hazard control takes advantage of existing acceptable processes and\nbest practices. Guidance and recommendations for acceptable processes and best\npractices are given in Sections 5.0 and 6.0 and in the appendices. If other methods are\nused, rationale and supporting data demonstrating the adequacy of those methods\nshould be presented.\nExamples of the kinds of battery failures that might employ DFMR include leakage and\ninternal short. Many battery or cell designs become impractical with the implementation\nof triple containment to be two-fault tolerant to catastrophic electrolyte leakage.\nSimilarly, the imposition of three layers of separators between anode and cathode to be\ntwo-fault tolerant to catastrophic cell internal short circuits hazards in many cases can\nseverely degrade performance.\nFor the purposes of streamlining the battery design approval, some simple battery\ndesigns below certain low energy and voltage thresholds as specified in Sections 4, 5\nand 6 herein also can use the DFMR approach for hazard control.\n4.1.3 Risk Classification\nThree levels of risk classifications have been defined for battery systems included in this\nspecification. Threshold limits are defined based on contained energy and experience\nwith specific manufacturing methods and cell formats. Safety of crew, vehicle, and\nmission may be a factor in selecting the appropriate classification. For systems which\ndo not confirm with established limits, the next higher level of classification is\n14\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

The following section specifies general requirements in\nthose areas and provides references to additional best practices.\nApplication of the requirements in this section is dependent on risk classification. The\nitalicized text provides guidance for requirement application to critical and non-critical\nbattery systems.\nJSC 66548 can be used as an example for the flight certification and acceptance of\nCOTS lithium-ion batteries that details the level of testing required under the\nengineering, qualification, flight acceptance, and lot sample testing of COTS lithium-ion\nbatteries.\n4.2.1 Engineering Evaluation\nThis section addresses the preliminary evaluation of safety and performance features at\nboth the cell and battery level and would include the evaluation testing of prospective\ncells before their selection for use in a flight battery. Engineering evaluation commonly\nincludes abuse test protocols intended to assess safety and performance features\nnecessary for the battery design.\na. Cell and battery designs considered for flight shall first undergo evaluation testing\nto characterize the performance and safety of the flight battery design.\nb. Evaluation testing shall, at a minimum, consist of characterizing the cell and\nbattery safety under abuse conditions of overcharge, over-discharge into\nreversal, external short circuit and cell internal short circuit, temperature\ntolerance, vent and burst pressure determination and for critical/catastrophic\nbatteries (See 4.1.3) perform cell destructive physical analysis.\nc. Evaluation testing shall confirm manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications that are relevant to\nthe project, as well as confirm that the cell and/or battery design can handle\nunique requirements levied by the project.\n16\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

Accelerating Rate Calorimetry\n(ARC) is one such method.\nCell designs used in custom batteries should be examined by a combination of\ncomputed tomography and destructive physical analysis (DPA) (tear down) to assess\nquality of manufacture and absence of defects.\nWhen performing battery safety tests that simulate abuse conditions, the mechanical\nand thermal environment of the test article should be representative of conditions\nexpected during normal use.\n\n17\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

Qualification testing shall be performed to the worst-case relevant flight\nenvironments with margin.\nThe qualification sample of batteries should be randomly sampled from units\nfrom the flight lot that have passed acceptance testing.\nb. Environmental tests shall include, at a minimum, extreme temperature\nexposures, vacuum, and vibration tests.\nThe margin used for qualification tests will be provided by the respective projects or\nprograms or from SSP41172 for ISS environments. Appendix A may be used as a\nguideline for qualification vibration tests (QVTs) for cells and batteries if there are no\nproject-provided environments. The margin proposed here should be consistent with\nthe program\xe2\x80\x99s margining policies. In the event none are provided, as a guideline, 6 db\nabove the maximum expected is typically used.\nThe qualification of the battery should include testing the batteries to environmental and\nvibration levels that are higher than the mission requirements. The number of flight\nmissions that the batteries will be used for, along with the location of the battery in the\nspacecraft, should determine the period and level of vibration. As a minimum, the\nqualification test program should include the following:\n1. Functional baseline test (open circuit voltage (OCV), mass, capacity or load\ncheck, internal resistance, visual inspection).\n2. Vibration to qualification levels.\n3. Functional baseline test recheck.\n4. Charge/discharge cycles (for rechargeable batteries) or a load test (for primary\nbatteries) at 20 degrees Fahrenheit (\xc2\xb0F) margin above and below worst-case hot\nand worst-case cold, respectively.\n5. Functional baseline test recheck.\n6. Vacuum (approx. 0.1 psi) or equivalent leak checks.\n7. Functional baseline test recheck.\nFor batteries used in a pressurized volume or environment, exposure to a vacuum\nenvironment (approximately 0.1 psi) for a minimum of 6 hours should be carried out.\nFor batteries used in an unpressurized volume or environment, thermal vacuum cycles\nmust be performed with the deep vacuum levels below 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x934 Torr (instead of the 0.1\npsi used for habitable volume/pressurized environments). Alternatively, the thermal\ncycles and vacuum environment tests can be performed independently.\nIf the acceptance test vibration levels and spectra used to screen cells for\nmanufacturing defects are not enveloped by the mission vibration levels, a separate\nqualification for acceptance vibration test (AVT) should be performed to verify that the\nscreening levels do not degrade cell reliability.\n18\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\nThe qualification batteries should pass all cell and battery acceptance tests as\ndescribed in Section 4.2.3 prior subjecting them to qualification tests.\nFor custom battery designs, safety (abuse) testing performed during engineering\nevaluation should be repeated at qualification with pass/fail criteria for the qualification\ntests determined based on information derived during engineering evaluation.\nc. Flight cell lot destructive testing shall consume a randomly selected sample size\nthat is, at minimum, 3 percent of the flight lot size or three cells, whichever is\ngreater for each destructive test. The destructive test sample size need not\nexceed 350 cells.\nThis is to adequately populate the test matrix necessary to confirm critical safety\nand performance characteristics, especially those features that are critical for\nmission and crew safety. For COTS batteries, cells can be obtained from the\ndisassembly of a sample from the battery flight lot. To achieve statistically\nsignificant results, all initial destructive tests must be populated with a minimum\nof three cells. The maximum sample size was established to define as a\nreasonable limit.\nd. The operation of cell safety devices, if used as a control at the battery level, shall\nbe verified by a qualification test at the battery level or at a level that accurately\nsimulates the level at which the control is required to confirm the operation of the\nsafety device.\nThe pass/fail criteria for these qualification tests should be established after\nengineering evaluation tests are completed.\ne. To verify cell manufacturing quality does not vary within the lot, cell lot\ndestructive testing shall include a minimum of 3 randomly selected cells (or 3\ncells from 1 randomly selected COTS battery) that has passed cell (or battery)\nacceptance screening.\nThe cell/battery should be downgraded from flight class to uncontrolled class\nprior to the DPA. Supporting the DPA with a prior CT scan examination is\nrecommended. The pass/fail criteria for the DPA should be established after the\nengineering DPAs are completed. Variation of components and methods used in\ncell construction can be detected by DPA and are grounds for lot rejection.\nf. Qualification testing shall be performed at the battery level, using flight equivalent\nbuilds.\nMultiple qualification units may be used to run different tests in parallel. Tests\nmay be re-sequenced to accommodate schedule and resource constraints as\nlong as the intent of the test is not compromised.\nBattery designs deemed non-critical need only provide verification evidence as required\nto complete the Unique Hazard Report for the subject battery system.\n4.2.3 Acceptance Testing\n19\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

Cell lots intended for custom flight batteries shall undergo 100-percent\nacceptance screening that includes, at minimum, visual inspection of bare cell\nwith shrink wrap removed if present, mass, OCV retention, alternating current\n(AC) and direct current (DC) resistance.\nWork Instruction EP-WI-031 provides an example of OCV retention screen.\nb. Batteries intended for flight shall undergo flight acceptance (nondestructive)\ntesting, which will include an evaluation of OCV, mass, capacity (for\nrechargeable chemistries) or load check (for primaries), internal resistance,\nvisual inspection, vibration to flight acceptance levels, and thermal/vacuum\ntesting.\nAs a minimum, the flight acceptance test program should include the following:\n1. Functional baseline test (OCV, mass, capacity (for rechargeable chemistries or\nload check for primaries), internal resistance, and visual inspection).\n2. Vibration to flight acceptance levels (see Appendix A for more details).\n3. Functional baseline test recheck.\n4. Vacuum (approx. 0.1 psi) or equivalent leak checks.\n5. Functional baseline test recheck.\nFor batteries used in a pressurized volume or environment, exposure to a\nvacuum environment (approximately 0.1 psi) for a minimum of 6 hours.\nFor batteries used in an unpressurized volume or environment, thermal vacuum\ncycles must be performed with the deep vacuum levels below 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x934 Torr\n(instead of the 0.1 psi used for habitable volume/pressurized environments).\nAlternatively, the thermal cycles and vacuum environment tests can be\nperformed independently.\nDetails of recommended flight acceptance tests are provided under each battery\nchemistry section in Section 6 with a detailed example in Section 6\xe2\x80\x99s lithium-ion section.\nFor those chemistries not listed in Section 6, early consultation with program technical\nstaff is recommended.\nBattery designs deemed non-critical need only provide cell verification in the form of UL\n(or similar) certification data or acceptance test results, battery system functional\nperformance, and verification of hazard control features.\n4.3\n\nManufacturing Quality\n\nThis section contains quality related provisions on the manufacturing lot and is intended\nto outline certain key aspects of manufacturing quality.\n4.3.1 Configuration Control\n20\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

This includes periodic\nindependent verification of the certificates of compliance and/or analyses to meet\nrequired specifications for composition, impurities, and properties of materials and\ncomponents. Configuration control requires complete two-way traceability, which is\ndefined as documentation that demonstrates a solid chain of custody from incoming\nmaterials to final assembly and vice versa.\nCustom and critical battery system designs should have independent material\nverifications by the cell manufacturer or customer (NASA or NASA contractor). Noncritical battery designs can rely on UL certification or international standard verification\nto insure configuration control. In no situation is the manufacturer specification sheet a\nviable form of cell performance verification.\n4.3.2 Subsequent Flight Lot Testing\nSome applications could require additional lots of flight batteries/cells beyond the\noriginal lot that was acceptance tested, qualified, and approved for flight. Key safety\nfeatures must be retested to be sure that the new cell lots are performing like the\nprevious qualified lot.\na. Any new COTS battery lot and/or cell date code shall require a repeat of all\nbattery and/or cell lot qualification testing and mitigation measures specified in\nSection 4.2.2.\nAn exception can be made for COTS cell batches delivered with two date codes\nthat represent consecutive days if it can be verified the two days spanned a\nsingle production run.\nb. Subsequent flight cell lot destructive testing shall confirm that subsequent lot\nperformance and safety features are the same as that of the original qualification\nlot.\nA key purpose of this repetition is to gain confidence that configuration control of the\nmanufacturing process is still effective and that the new cell lots are performing like the\nprevious qualified lot. For example, if a cell internal fusible link is used as a control for\nexternal short circuit hazards, sample cells from each subsequent lot should be tested\nto confirm that the fusible link works as expected.\nLot sample testing is carried out to confirm that the safety tolerances of the\ncells/batteries remain the same compared with the original lot. A statistically significant\n21\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\nnumber of cells/batteries should be randomly selected for lot sample testing and should\nbe based on the flight program, the number of cells manufactured, the period between\nmanufacturing of the lots, the original materials that go into the manufacturing of a\nsingle lot, etc. A 3- to 6-percent sample size has been used for past flight battery\nprograms.\nFor cell designs with configuration control, subsequent flight lot destructive testing can\nconsist of a reduced set of lot sample testing but should include computed tomography\n(CT)/DPA, capacity (primary), 100-percent depth of discharge (DoD) cycle life\n(rechargeable), ARC or similar method (lithium), short circuit, and overcharge\n(rechargeable).\n4.4\n\nGeneral Design Requirements\n\nThe following design requirements are general in nature. They are generally applicable\nto all battery builds.\n\n22\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\n4.4.1 Electrical Interconnection\nThe solid interconnection of cells to make up the battery is crucial in preventing ohmic\nheating, which would result in reduced performance and/or life and may result in a\nhazardous overheating of cells within the battery.\na. The electrical interconnections that form the pack through the interconnection of\ncells shall be made of low-resistance connections such that ohmic heating at the\ndesign load presents no over-temperature hazard.\nb. The means of interconnection (i.e., mechanical fasteners, tack weld, etc.) and its\nverification shall ensure that the flight environments and usage profile do not\nreduce the effectiveness of the connection.\nIn the case of bus bar interconnections via threaded fasteners, flight vibration as well as\nthermal variation over the course of the load profile would tend to loosen the\nconnection. Torqueing requirements coupled with fastener locking features are\nnecessary to ensure the effectiveness of the connection throughout the mission\n(reference NASA-STD-5020, \xe2\x80\x9cRequirements for Threaded Fastening Systems in\nSpaceflight Hardware,\xe2\x80\x9d for best practices).\n4.4.2 Electrical Wiring\nThe integrity of wire and the insulation used within the battery must be ensured.\na. Wiring used within the flight battery shall adhere to Electrical Wire and Cable\nAcceptance Tests described in JSC-STD-8080.5 E-24 or be certified via an\nequivalent standard.\n4.4.3 Lithium-ion Battery and Cell Monitoring\nFor lithium-ion batteries, monitoring of key parameters such as cell/battery voltages, cell\ntemperature, and battery/string current is necessary to ascertain health and maintain\nsafe operation of the battery. Monitoring of pertinent parameters may show adverse\ntrends in the state of health and can be essential to investigating failures within the\nbattery.\na. For custom or COTS batteries with catastrophic failure modes due to cell\nunder/over voltage, monitoring shall be provided in order to detect and control\nhazardous under/over voltage of any cell in the battery.\nThe requirements here seek to strike a balance between monitoring required for\nsafety and the reliability of the battery and accompanying instrumentation.\nb. For custom or COTS batteries with catastrophic failure modes due to high\ncurrents, battery-level current monitoring shall be provided in order to detect and\ncontrol hazardous currents in the battery.\n23\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\nc. For custom or COTS batteries with catastrophic failure modes due to high/low\ntemperatures, temperature monitoring shall be provided to detect and control\nhazardous temperatures at any cell in the battery.\nOptimal number and placement of the temperature sensors to provide adequate\ncoverage for all cells should be based on high-fidelity thermal analysis for\nnominal and off-nominal conditions.\nd. For custom battery designs with catastrophic failure modes, instrumentation shall\ncollect data during use and during charge and be reviewable on the ground for\nuse in trending and/or post anomaly analysis.\nThe requirements above focus on key measurements and time periods for\nmonitoring. For example, a requirement to monitor key parameters even when not in\nuse (i.e., on the shelf) may be prohibitive (i.e., may drive a monitoring system that is\nself-powered and self-contained within the battery) and yield other adverse\neffects. Similarly, for the purpose of trending, it is acceptable to only monitor/record key\nparameters before, during, and after each charge to increase simplicity and reliability\nthe battery for the discharge phase.\n4.4.4 Cell Matching\nCell performance matching for selection into batteries is a useful practice in custom\nbattery builds when done in addition to cell acceptance screening specified in Section\n4.2.3b.\na. For custom batteries with catastrophic failure modes, cell performance matching\nprior to battery assembly shall be performed to mitigate state-of-charge (SOC)\nimbalances that could adversely affect battery performance and/or safety.\nb. For custom batteries with catastrophic failure modes, cells shall be matched in a\nbattery based on charge retention, internal resistance and/or AC impedance, and\nampere-hour capacity (for rechargeable chemistries).\nThe requirements above prescribe a matching protocol intended to select from the\nacceptance screened lot of cells. These requirements are not a remedy for poor lot\nuniformity. Note that cell matching and the use of balancing circuits should not be\nrationale for accepting lots with poor cell lot uniformity, which indicates a less\ncontrolled manufacturing process and may indicate product with a higher likelihood\nof rapid degradation of field performance.\n4.4.5 Dissimilar Controls\nFor battery chemistries with catastrophic failure modes due to excessive charge or\ndischarge (including external short circuit), software-based controls to mitigate these\nhazards are more and more common. These controllers manage the charging and\ndischarging of the battery within safe parameters and can be located in the battery\ncharger, the power distribution system, and/or the battery itself.\n24\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

For custom batteries with catastrophic failure modes, software-based controls\nresponsible for managing the charge/discharge of the battery shall operate inside\na safe envelope maintained by active or passive hardware-based controls and\nguards.\nb. For custom batteries with catastrophic failure modes, in cases where softwarebased controls are not enveloped by hardware controls, the software is safety\ncritical and its development shall include conventional software assurance\nprocesses and confidence not based solely on integrated testing.\nWhere computer based controls are used, applicable safety requirements (SSP\n50038) will need to be met.\n4.5\n\nMission Usage\na. During the preparation phase for on-orbit processing, the hardware owner shall\nprovide details for safe operation of the hardware on-orbit, any on-orbit\nprocessing that may be required, and safe stowage or disposal.\nb. The hardware owner shall establish on-orbit processes and operational\nconstraints in coordination with the mission controllers for the hardware.\nProvide on-orbit processes that may include procedures for hardware inspection\nand checkout that are required prior to on-orbit usage of the equipment.\nProvide procedures to dispose of depleted cell(s) and batteries and replace them\nif the battery-powered applications are designed for on-orbit replacement.\nProvide procedures for recharging, re-installing, and storing rechargeable cells\nand batteries if the application is designed for rechargeable cells or batteries.\nProvide procedures to remove, visually inspect, tape, and bag depleted or\ndiscrepant cells and battery packs and place them in dry trash.\nNOTE: For cells and batteries that are returned as trash on Russian vehicles, the\nrequirements given in P32928-103, "Requirement for International Partner\nCargoes Transported on Russian Progress and Soyuz Vehicles," are followed.\nCrew members should record anomalies during any phase of battery use from\ninstallation and usage through removal/recharge to storage/disposal.\n\nc.\n\nFor the custom lithium-ion battery designs that are designated as catastrophic\n(see 4.1.3) and required to be used in a crewed environment for more than 1 year\nor for multiple missions requiring launch and landing, the health of the battery\nshall be monitored to allow insight into changes that could lead to a catastrophic\nfailure.\nThe long-term physical and chemical changes associated with the cells and\ninternal construction of the batteries are not typically fully understood when a\ncustom-designed battery is flown for space application; hence, it is imperative to\n25\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\nmonitor the health of the battery. Techniques such as thermography when the\nbattery is under load can provide information on bad welds or electrical\nconnections; unique discharge loads with a high current pulse inserted to provide\ninternal resistance measurements can also provide a warning to changes that\nmay lead to a catastrophic failure.\nA fleet leader may be provided on ground to monitor and characterize the health\nand physical appearance of the battery. The fleet leader should have storage\nand operating time and cycles, with margin, in excess of the flight units to provide\nconfidence that any anomalous behavior may be detected prior to occurring in\nflight.\n4.6\n\nPost-flight Cell and Pack Evaluation\na. A post-flight performance evaluation of the hardware and the batteries shall be\nconducted when hardware is returned post-flight.\nb. For cells and batteries installed in hardware during return flight, after the postflight evaluation, the cells and battery pack shall be removed so that the\nequipment may be stored without the cells and pack installed.\nAn exception is made for coin cells that provide memory storage for hardware.\nCells providing memory storage need not be removed unless performance\ndegradation has been noted, the shelf life has expired, or signs of damage or\ncorrosion are evident.\n\nFor additional information, battery storage is defined in JSC 26549, \xe2\x80\x9cJSC Manual for\nControl of Program Stock.\xe2\x80\x9d Details regarding the process for post-flight removal of cells\nor battery packs are provided in JWI 8705.3.\n4.7\n\nGround Processing Requirements\n\nBattery systems intended for crewed spacecraft must maintain safety during ground\nhandling, transportation, and ground operations. While this document contains a\nnumber of items that should be considered to ensure safety of ground battery\noperations and handling, the subset listed in this section is considered necessary and\ncontains requirements to ensure safe operation.\na.

GSE for batteries shall be designed such that the combination of the battery and\nGSE does not reduce the level of failure tolerance intended in the flight battery\ndesign.\nEquipment used to test or charge batteries should have redundant controls in\nplace, including dissimilar redundancy to prevent hazards due to malfunction of\ntest equipment.\nBest practices in GSE design include but are not limited to:\na. The polarity of GSE connecting to battery terminals should be keyed.\nb. For external chargers, the specification document for the charger should be used\nas guidance for the build and test procedures.\nc. COTS GSE should not be modified without GSE manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s\nrecommendations and approval.\nd. All test equipment, especially those interfacing with flight batteries, should be\ncalibrated periodically as required by the equipment manufacturer. Verification of\ncalibration should be confirmed before the start of test so that no calibration will\nbe required during the test program.\ne. Test protocols programmed into the GSE should have tolerance ranges for all the\nparameters used for charging or operation.\nf. Test protocols programmed into the GSE should have design limits specified for\nthe test parameters.\ng.

Hazard\nsources are identified, hazard manifestations are explained, and hazard prevention and\ncontrol requirements are presented. Not all controls will apply to all battery designs;\nhence, thorough identification of hazards and controls is required to prove design\nsafety.\nAt minimum, fire/explosion, chemical exposure, electrical shock, and touch temperature\nare battery hazards to crewed spacecraft and crew.\nRequirements:\na. The possible sources of battery hazards shall be identified for each battery\ndesign while considering the entire set of mission phases and conditions.\nb. Each hazard shall be evaluated to determine applicability and to identify all\nsources, which can be broadly categorized as inadequate design, poor\nworkmanship, and/or abuse (electrical, mechanical, and/or thermal).\nSee Section 6 for details of chemistry-specific battery hazard sources.\nc. The hazard severity shall be categorized as catastrophic, critical, or non-critical.\n5.1\n\nFire/Explosion Hazard\n\nFire and/or explosion hazards can result from the generation and ignition of a\ncombustible gas mixture, evolution of large quantities of free gases, or initiation of a\nrunaway internal reaction in a cell (thermal runaway). Excessive internal pressure\n(either within cell or battery enclosure) can result in failure of cell and/or battery seals\nand cases. Cell and/or battery contents can then be expelled from the cell, either slowly\nor forcibly. Shrapnel fragments from violent cell or battery enclosure bursting can cause\ndamage upon impact to personnel, structure, or equipment.\n5.1.1 Sources \xe2\x80\x93 Chemical Reaction\n1. Some batteries generate hydrogen and/or oxygen while discharging and/or\ncharging. Hydrogen gas, mixed with air or oxygen, is flammable and/or explosive\nover a concentration range of 4 percent to 75 percent by volume in air.\n2. Many aqueous electrolyte cells subjected to charging will generate oxygen as the\ncharge nears completion, providing oxygen where none may have existed\npreviously, such as in a battery container that had been purged with nitrogen to\nflush away oxygen.\n3. Accumulation of gases in a sealed cell or battery case can build up pressure\nwithin the case.\n4. A plugged or faulty pressure relief valve in a cell or battery enclosure.\n30\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\n5. Electrolysis of aqueous electrolyte on ground paths into hydrogen and oxygen,\ncreating an explosive gas mixture.\n6. Vaporization and decomposition of flammable electrolytes to form flammable\ngases or aerosols.\n5.1.1.1 Requirements \xe2\x80\x93 Chemical Reaction\nFlammability\na. Design of the hardware shall limit accumulation of hydrogen in enclosed spaces\ncontaining oxygen to less than 2 percent of the total free-space volume.\nThe traditional means of avoiding hydrogen accumulation is to provide\ncontinuous air ventilation at a rate sufficient to dilute evolved hydrogen below 2.0\npercent, which gives 100-percent margin below the 4-percent flammability level.\nWherever a flammable and/or explosive mixture of hydrogen and oxygen may\nexist, an ignition source is presumed to exist because the energy required for\nignition of stoichiometric hydrogen and oxygen mixtures is only on the order of 1\nto 2 microjoules.\nb. Electrolyte absorbing materials used in battery designs shall be nonflammable or\nflame retardant.\nElectrically conductive battery parts should be insulated to protect against a\nflammability hazard if the absorbent material could trap flammable electrolyte\nagainst those conductive battery parts.\nThe volume of void spaces inside the battery case that cannot be eliminated by\ndesign should be filled with electrolyte-resistant nonflammable filler, such as\npotting material or electrolyte absorbent material. Fillers limit the volume and\nmass of gases that can accumulate prior to venting, thus limiting the force of any\ngas explosion.\nVenting of Battery Enclosure\nc. The battery enclosure and cells shall prevent excessive pressure buildup due to\ngas accumulation.\nA venting feature is a designed opening or an intended weak point that will\nrelease below an intended pressure. A relief valve is a mechanism designed to\nopen at a specified pressure and may or may not reseal after the pressure is\nreleased.\nDepending on the cell chemistry and cell case, the venting feature may need a\nliquid impermeable, gas permeable covering to trap electrolyte while venting\ngases.\nCell vents or relief valves should not be blocked or plugged with the application\nof potting materials that would prevent them from venting safely.\n31\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

Relief valves and vents used as controls for the accumulation of excessive\npressure shall be tested.\nCell vents should be tested in a flight-like mechanical configuration to verify that\nthey operate correctly at the designed pressure.\nRelief valves on battery enclosures should be tested after installation to verify\nthat they operate correctly at the designed pressure.\n\n32\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

If the battery cell enclosure failure mode is demonstrated to be leak-before-burst,\nthen the ratio of failure pressure to vent pressure shall be a minimum of 1.5:1.\nA test of relief-valve-equipped cells and battery cases should disable the relief\nfunction and then apply an internal pressure equal to 1.5 times the relief valve\nmaximum vent pressure. There should be no detectable leak.\nLeak-before-burst: A design concept in which potentially critical flaws will grow\nthrough the wall of the pressurized hardware and cause pressure-relieving\nleakage rather than burst (catastrophic failure) at maximum design pressure.\nf. All other cell enclosures shall demonstrate a minimum ratio of failure pressure to\nvent pressure of 2.5:1.\ng. Cells that do not meet the 1.5:1 ratio shall not be used for manned space\napplications.\nBatteries with pressurized metallic cells that exceed an internal pressure of 100\npsi are classified as special pressurized equipment and must meet the leakbefore-burst failure mode, demonstrate a minimum factor of safety for the design\nburst to maximum design pressure of 1.5:1 and follow acceptance and\nqualification test requirements as called out in ANSI/AIAA S-080-1998, \xe2\x80\x9cSpace\nSystems \xe2\x80\x93 Metallic Pressure Vessels, Pressurized Structures, and Pressure\nComponents.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor fracture control, batteries are unique forms of pressurized containers.\nBatteries and battery systems can be classified as non-fracture-critical by\nmeeting one of the following:\n1. Non-hazardous leak-before-burst design.\n2. The pressure of the sealed container is less than 689.5 KPa (100 psia);\nthe sealed container does not contain a hazardous fluid; and loss of\npressure in the system will not result in a catastrophic hazard.\n3. Small batteries that fall under the noncritical category (see 4.1.3) are\nexempt from fracture control.\nOtherwise, the requirements of NASA-STD-5019, \xe2\x80\x9cFracture Control\nRequirements for Spaceflight Hardware,\xe2\x80\x9d must be addressed.\n5.1.2 Sources \xe2\x80\x93 Overcharge Failure/Over-discharge Failure\n1.

Improper charging device or method.\n5. Increase in cell imbalance caused when batteries with unbalanced cells in series\nare charged and discharged, which leads to further variations in cell voltages\nand/or capacities with service life. This can lead to inadvertent over-discharge of\none or more cells in a string, potentially causing the weak cells to go into a\nvoltage reversal (over-discharge) condition.\n6. Circulating currents between parallel-connected cell stacks resulting from\nlowered voltage in one or more stacks due to cell or insulating material\ndegradation, followed by current flow from adjacent electrically sound stacks as a\nresult of the difference between stack potentials.\n5.1.2.1 Requirements - Overcharge Failure/Over-discharge Failure\na. The battery/charger design shall maintain required failure tolerance against\novercharge/ over-discharge failure.\nb. Operational procedures shall ensure that the battery is not operated outside\nlimits recommended by the cell/battery pack manufacturer or that established\nduring qualification testing.\nc. The charger shall be designed for the specific type of battery being used and\nincorporate the necessary charge termination controls.\nCharge termination criteria usually vary with battery chemistry.\nd. Inadvertent charging of primary batteries shall be prevented.\nFor batteries with cells or cell strings that should not be charged (as in primary/\nnonrechargeable batteries), redundant serial blocking diodes should be installed\nin each parallel leg of a battery consisting of primary cells to prevent circulating\ncurrents between parallel cells or cell stacks, unless tests show these currents\ncannot present catastrophic failure modes. Small Schottky diodes have been\nused for this purpose to minimize voltage drop.\ne. Uncontrolled charging of secondary batteries shall be prevented.\nf. Charger circuit schematic shall be reviewed and evaluated for required failure\ntolerance.\ng. For external chargers, the specification document for the charger shall be used\nas guidance for the development of in-flight charging procedures.\nh. If it can lead to a hazardous condition, the charger shall be designed to stop\ncharging the battery after a set period of time to prevent continuous balancing\ncharge discharge loops.\ni.\n\nOperational tolerances of the charger shall not exceed the safe operating range\nof the cell or battery.\n34\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

Circulating currents due to corona arcing between poorly insulated conductive\nsurfaces in high-voltage batteries while exposed to low pressures.\n5.1.3.1 Requirements \xe2\x80\x93 External Short Circuit\na. External shorts to the battery shall be controlled using a combination of\npreventive controls.\nExternal shorts are normally prevented using insulative barriers and current\nlimiters. Insulative barriers include well-insulated connectors with adequate\nseparation between positive and negative battery pins, adequate cable\ninsulation, insulation between internal cell terminals and the battery case,\ninsulation between banks of series cells, etc.\nCircuit interrupters that are rated well below the battery\'s peak current source\ncapability should be installed in the battery power circuit. Interrupters may be\nfuses, circuit breakers, thermal switches, PTCs, or other effective devices.\nCircuit interrupters (as one of several design constraints on limiter sizing) such as\nfuses should be rated at\n200 percent of the maximum load to be provided by the battery in order to avoid\nnuisance trips. Circuit interrupters other than fuses should be rated at a value\nthat is equal to or lower than the maximum current that the cell is capable of\nhandling without causing venting, smoke, explosion, fire, or thermal runaway.\nSince the battery case is usually grounded/bonded to the structure, the\ninterrupters should be in the ground (negative) leg of a battery where the\nnegative terminal is connected to ground.

Demonstrating tolerance to all external shorts does not imply\nachieving tolerance to all internal shorts. There are no tests that fully screen for\nthe possibility or the severity of outcome for an internal short circuit of an\nindividual cell.\nAlthough thermal runaway has been attributed in some cases to internal shorts, it\nis difficult to prove that this was the cause due to the loss of evidence after such\nan event. Although difficult to prove after an event, this phenomenon has been\nwell studied with simulated internal shorts in a research environment using\ndifferent methods.\nInternal shorts can occur in two ways:\n1. Poor quality control of the cell manufacturing process that allow impurities\nand contaminants to be present as latent defects inside the cell, which can\nlater pierce the separator causing an internal short circuit that can result in\nelectrolyte leakage, fire, and thermal runaway.\n2. Cells used beyond their specifications, such as charge and discharge\nrates beyond the manufacturer\'s recommended limits; exceeding\nmaximum charge current, end-of-charge, or end-of-discharge voltages; or\nexceeding operational temperature environments.\nIn lithium ion rechargeable batteries, these deviations can cause the\ndeposition of dendritic deposits of lithium during charge and of copper\nafter a dissolution and deposition during over-discharge which may cause\nseparator damage. If these dendrites create an internal short circuit,\nlocalized temperature rise due to localized high current flow through the\ninternal short circuit can lead to eventual thermal runaway and fire due to\nthe flammability of the electrolyte.\nAll cell chemistries and cell designs are susceptible to internal shorts. However,\nnot all internal shorts result in a thermal runaway. If thermal runaway occurs\nduring cell abuse testing (see Section 4.2.1.b), then the cells are referred to as\nintolerant of internal shorts. In general, most lithium-based cell chemistries are\nprone to catastrophic internal shorts, while those with aqueous electrolytes are\nnot.\nSources of internal cell short:\n1. Induced via charge/discharge and temperature abuse, which can cause\nthe deposition of metallic dendrites of copper and/or lithium upon cycling,\nleading to separator stress to the point of failure\n39\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

Cells used in COTS batteries or cells selected for a custom battery shall be\nevaluated to ascertain the severity of an internal short circuit event.\nEvaluation criteria of the short circuit event can include, but are not limited to,\nmaximum cell temperature achieved, time to maximum temperature and duration\nof event, products vented/ejected from the cell, measurement and/or video of\nflames/hot gases exiting the cell, etc.\nInternal short circuits can be initiated and triggered within a cell by various\nthermal and mechanical methods. The mechanical methods involve crushing,\npenetrating, and/or shocking forces applied to the cell. Thermal methods involve\nheat exposure to damage the separator that insulates the anode and cathode.\nMore advanced methods involve implanting defects into a cell either during\nmanufacture or afterwards and triggering the short by mechanical or thermal\nmeans.\nb. Measures shall be taken to reduce the likelihood and/or severity of an internal\nshort circuit event to a level acceptable to the program/project.\nBest practices listed below are intended to minimize the likelihood of a cell internal short\nevent occurring. Section 5.1.5 discusses steps to be taken when trying to minimize the\nconsequence/severity of an internal short circuit event in a custom battery design.\n1. Design mitigation measures\na. In the case of a custom battery design, only cell designs whose\nperformance and safety have been sufficiently characterized to support\nsafety assessment and validation of the abuse tolerance and where\ninsight into the manufacturing control process is provided should be\napproved.\nb. In the case of COTS battery designs, only batteries whose\nperformance and safety have been sufficiently characterized to support\nsafety assessment and validation of the abuse tolerance should be\napproved.\nc. Batteries should be designed to perform well within the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s\nspecifications for the cells used to build the battery.\nd. If a particular cell/battery is to be used in an application or environment\nthat is beyond the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification, extensive testing with\n40\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

Battery designs should also have the required fault tolerance in place\nto prevent the cells from being subjected to off-nominal conditions that\nresult in the formation of internal shorts.\nf. Cells or batteries used in space applications should not have any\nrecords of Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalls.\n2. Manufacturing mitigation measures\na. For custom battery designs, cells should be selected from cell\nmanufacturers with a mature production history.\nb. Cell lots should be defined for each battery system as all cells with a\ncommon date code made from the same continuous production run.\nc. In the case of a custom cell or custom battery design, a cell production\nline audit of the cell design should be conducted to evaluate how well\ncontamination, humidity control, and cell defects are limited in all\nphases of cell production processes. High particle counts and poor\ncontamination and humidity control are known to contribute to the high\noccurrence of cell failures.\n\n41\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\n3. Test mitigation measures\na. For custom battery designs, rigorous 100-percent cell acceptance\ntesting should be carried out, including charge retention (soft shorts),\nperformance uniformity. Poor OCV stability, poor coulombic efficiency\n(discharge ampere-hour (Ah) out/charge Ah in), internal resistance\nfluctuations, and high self-discharge (poor voltage retention) are\nindicators of internal cell defects that could result in an internal short\ncircuit. As an additional measure, the cells can be X-rayed for jelly roll\nor stack misalignment and other defects that could cause internal\nshorts. Credit can be taken for X-rays carried out at the manufacturing\nfacility.\nb. For custom-designed and COTS batteries, early in the cell design\nselection process random sample cells should be examined by DPA\nand nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques (CT scans or highresolution X-rays) to look for defects that could develop into latent\ninternal short circuits. Since production quality is known to vary from\nlot to lot, this DPA and NDE sample testing should be required for all\nflight lots.\nc. All anomalous observations in a DPA should be chemically analyzed\nand discussed with the cell manufacturer to determine whether they\nwill lead to a catastrophic latent defect through the life of the cell.\nd. For lithium-ion and primary lithium systems, the vibration test levels\nshould be significantly higher than those typically imposed for\nacceptance tests intended to detect workmanship defects (Appendix\nA). As a consequence, qualification acceptance vibration testing,\nwhich is done at levels at least two times than that used for\nacceptance, may be necessary to demonstrate that the higher\nacceptance levels will not adversely impact performance (see\nAppendix A).\n4. Operation\na. The battery system should be operated in a way that preserves\nmeasurably positive margins in operating voltage, current,\ntemperature, and cycle life versus the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s limits for the cell\ndesign.\nb. If the cell/battery is to be used in environments or applications that are\nbeyond the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification, relevant testing should be\ncarried out to qualify the battery design to confirm that no failures will\ndevelop due to this type of usage during the life of the battery. In\naddition, samples from each new lot should be tested to confirm that\nthis tolerance and safe performance capability exists on subsequent\nproductions.\nInformation on mitigating measures for the lithium-based chemistries is provided in the\nrelevant sections in Section 6.\n42\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

For battery designs greater than a 80-Wh energy employing high specific energy\ncells (greater than 80 watt-hours/kg, for example, lithium-ion chemistries) with\ncatastrophic failure modes, the battery shall be evaluated to ascertain the\nseverity of a worst-case single-cell thermal runaway event and the propensity of\nthe design to demonstrate cell-to-cell propagation in the intended application and\nenvironment.\nWorst-case thermal runaway events will include method and location of thermal\nrunaway initiation and environmental conditions. Thermal analysis that considers\nohmic and entropic heating should be performed and validated by test.\nNASA has traditionally addressed the threat of thermal runaway incidents in its\nbattery deployments through comprehensive prevention protocols. This\nprevention-centered approach has included extensive screening for\nmanufacturing defects, as well as robust battery management controls that\nprevent abuse-induced runaway even in the face of multiple system failures.\nThis focused strategy has made the likelihood of occurrence of such an event\nhighly improbable.\nThis requirement focuses not on the likelihood of such an event but rather on\nunderstanding the severity of consequences in the intended application should\nthis unlikely event occur. Understanding the consequences of an event allows\nan informed risk assessment and identifies potential mitigation via design or\noperations.\nb. The evaluation shall include all necessary analysis and test to quantify the\nseverity (consequence) of the event in the intended application and environment\nas well as to identify design modifications to the battery or the system that could\nappreciably reduce that severity.\nIn addition to prevention protocols, programs developing battery designs with\ncatastrophic failure modes should take the steps necessary to assess the\nseverity of a possible thermal runaway event. Programs should assess whether\nthere are reasonable design changes that could appreciably affect the severity of\nthe outcome.\n\n43\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

For example, lithium-sulfur dioxide cells have built-in\noverpressure vents that will release SO2 (sulfur dioxide) gas and other electrolyte\ncomponents that are highly toxic; thus, these are unacceptable in the habitable area of\na space vehicle. However, that chemistry has been used safely in the non-pressurized\nareas of crewed spacecraft. Note that the thrust possible from a cell/battery venting\nincident should be addressed for possible impacts to vehicle mission. When at all\npossible, it is better to build a battery using a cell chemistry and cell design that is\ninherently safe on its own for space vehicle use rather than applying extensive (and\noften costly) modifications to make an inherently unsuitable cell acceptable for crewed\nflight use.\nBatteries can be categorized into three main types: primary, secondary, and reserve.\nThe primary batteries are typically one-time usage types and are not capable of being\ncharged after they are depleted. The secondary batteries are those that can be\nrecharged. The reserve batteries are those in which the active materials are mixed just\nbefore use.\nThe following is a historical list of cell chemistries, both primary (nonrechargeable) and\nsecondary (rechargeable), which have been flown on crewed space vehicles.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAlkaline-manganese primary\nLeClanche (carbon-zinc) primary\nLead-acid secondary cells having immobilized electrolyte\nLithium/lithium-ion polymer secondary (including lithium-polymer variation)\nLithium metal anode primary cells having the following cathodic (positive) active\nmaterials:\no Poly-carbon monofluoride\no Iodine\no Manganese dioxide\no Silver chromate\no Sulfur dioxide (external to habitable spaces only)\no Thionyl chloride\no Thionyl chloride with bromine chloride complex additive (Li-BCX)\no Iron disulfide\nLithium sulfur\nMercuric oxide-zinc primary\nNickel-cadmium secondary\nNickel-hydrogen secondary\n53\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

Use of these chemistries should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for\nuse in crewed flight.\nOften the cells used in batteries for crewed space vehicle are commercially available. A\nspecial "government" purchase is not required for alkaline, zinc-air, and lithium coin\ncells; however, minimal screening tests are required of sample commercial cells to\nensure the cells will perform in the required load and environment without leakage or\nfailure. Specific certification tests may also be required of a battery depending on its\napplication and design. Often a certificate of compliance regarding manufacturing\nprocesses and shelf life data is required by Safety and Mission Assurance personnel\nresponsible for certifying the hardware, so designers are cautioned to inquire ahead of\ntime regarding necessary documentation.\nTo ensure that cells are fresh for flight use, shelf-life limits from the date the cells are\nmanufactured have been established for the various chemistries. See Appendix C for\nmore details on shelf and service life. Battery providers need to keep in mind that\nstowage of a cell with a bypass diode across the cell/battery terminals can cause a slow\ndrain of capacity of the cell, thus lowering the service life.\nRechargeable cells typically are stowed late to retain a good charge on the cells for\nflight use. Rechargeable cells generally have a faster self-discharge rate than primary\ncells, so some launch delays could force a hardware exchange with freshly charged\ncells or a recharge on the launch pad (with prior approval). In cases where large nickelhydrogen batteries will require charging in a space vehicle on the launch pad,\nconsideration should be given to see that adequate cooling of the battery is available.\n6.1\n\nAlkaline Primary Batteries\n\n6.1.1 Definition\nAlkaline manganese dioxide cells were introduced in the early 1960\xe2\x80\x99s and have become\nthe most dominant battery cell in use today. They have higher energy density, better\nservice and shelf life, and better resistance to leakage than the carbon-zinc cell. The\ncell is typically of a bobbin (or button) design.\nThe basic electrochemical processes taking place in these alkaline cells are:\nAnode:\n\nZn + 2 OH-\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nZn(OH)2 + 2 e-\n\nCathode:\n\n2MnO2 + H2O + 2 e-\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\n2MnOOH + 2 OH-\n\n55\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

The nominal voltage of alkaline cells ranges from\n1.5 to 1.6 V, and most of their capacity is consumed when the voltage drops to about\n1.0 V. Shelf life limits are summarized in Appendix C.\n6.1.2 Hazard Sources\nAs with any aqueous electrolyte, the cell can generate flammable mixtures of hydrogen\nand oxygen. The KOH electrolyte is extremely caustic and can cause damage to eyes,\nskin, and mucous membranes, as well as corrosion of metals. In short circuit\nconditions, these cells can exceed touch temperature limits and swell to the point that\nremoval from cylindrical constraints becomes difficult. Silver oxide cells utilize the same\nKOH electrolyte and are considered within this section.\n6.1.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\na. The battery boxes used for alkaline cells should be vented and have a\nnonconductive coating and absorbent material.\nb. Non Critical alkaline battery designs are documented on a Unique Hazard\nReport.\nc. The unique hazard report should include cell product information, Underwriters\nLaboratory (UL) or international standard safety test data, and a circuit schematic\nshowing the safety circuitry (e.g., fuses, diodes, etc.). In the absence of\nverification data and/or safety circuitry, testing should be performed to provide\nthis safety data.\nd. For cells and batteries listed in the Non Critical category, flight acceptance\ntesting should include functional tests OCV, CCV, mass, internal resistance, and\nvisual inspection.\ne. For batteries that do not fall within the Non Critical category, a complete\nengineering, qualification, and flight acceptance test program should be\ncompleted and a Unique Hazard Report should be submitted.\nf. Alkaline cells should not be left in devices that are not operated for more than 1\nyear. If devices will not be used for more than 1 year, the alkaline cells should be\nremoved and discarded after each use.\ng. Alkaline cells that are partially used should not be stored and reused. Tracking\nof performance for each cell is cost and time prohibitive; hence, they should be\ndiscarded in dry trash after each use.\n6.2\n\nAlkaline Secondary Batteries\n\n6.2.1 Definition\n56\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\n\nIn the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, "rechargeable" alkaline cells entered the commercial cell market.\nHistorically, alkaline cells have been used solely as primary, nonrechargeable cells.\nAlkaline cells being advertised as rechargeable are sold with a special charger that\nshould be used, following strict instructions, in order to achieve rechargeability.\nHowever, since their performance and capacity is significantly less than alternative\nprimaries, a comparison with a nickel-metal hydride battery design is advised before this\noption.\n6.2.2 Hazard Sources\nDue to the hazards associated with charging cells and the strict routine that should be\nfollowed for processing these cells through charge/discharge cycles, flight hardware\nusing "rechargeable" alkaline cells should be on a case-by-case basis. Since the\ncommercial chargers typically lack the type of fail-safe controls required for use of the\nhardware in the space vehicle environment, the use of the commercial chargers should\nbe restricted. A thorough evaluation of the charger design is required to identify the\nhazard controls inherent in the design, if any, and the missing hazard controls. The\napplicable hazards detailed in subsections of Section 4.0 should be accounted for in the\ndesign, especially controls concerning the hazards associated with gas generation, high\ntemperature, and charging.\n6.2.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\nThe controls from Section 5 are applicable here. In addition, the applicable controls\ndetailed in subsections of Section 5 should be accounted for in the design, especially\ncontrols concerning the hazards associated with charging.\n6.3\n\nLead-Acid Batteries\n\n6.3.1 Definition\nThe practical lead-acid battery traces its origins to 1860 and is one of the few batteries\nwith acid electrolyte (battery acid). Since this battery generates hydrogen during charge\nand discharge and on open circuit, the Vent Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) battery is not\nto be flown without a waiver. The Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) battery cell is designed to\ncontain any hydrogen generated within the cell case.\nThe half-reactions in a lead-acid battery are the following:\nAnode:\n\nPb\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nPb2+ + 2e-\n\nPb2+ + SO42Cathode:\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nPbO2 + 4H+ + 2e- \xef\x83\xb3\n\nPb2+ + 2H2O\n\nPbSO4\n\n57\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

The \xce\xb1 form contributes to a higher cycle\nlife, although it is slightly less electrochemically active and lower in gravimetric energy\ndensity. The electrolyte is sulfuric acid of about 37 percent by weight (approximately\n2M H2SO4) and a specific gravity of 1.26 to 1.28 when fully charged.\nThe operating voltage of the cell is typically 2.0 to 1.75 V; however, the cell can be\ndischarged down to 1.0 V. Lead-acid cells are charged using a constant voltage\nprotocol to 2.39 V, and because most of these are used as uninterruptible power\nsources, they should be kept fully charged at a float voltage between 2.17 to 2.25 V,\nwith this voltage being dependent on the nature of the anode and the specific gravity of\nthe electrolyte. A shelf life of 7 years can be obtained if the cells are maintained at a\nfloat voltage when not in use.\n6.3.2 Hazard Sources\na. The traditional concerns with lead-acid batteries are hydrogen generation and\nloss of electrolyte containment.\nb. This cell chemistry is capable of extremely high current rates, which could result\nin burns to the crew or overheating of improperly protected electronic\ncomponents.\n6.3.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\na. Appropriate absorbent materials should be used to contain any electrolyte vented\nfrom the cells.\nb. Fusing components should be used to limit the maximum discharge capability of\nthe battery.\nc. All batteries should be two-fault tolerant to overcharge and external short\nhazards (see Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3, respectively) and a Unique Hazard\nReport should be completed.\nd. All batteries should undergo engineering, qualification, and flight acceptance\ntesting.\ne. Sample lot testing should be performed on 3 to 6 percent of every new lot of cells\nand batteries procured for the same application.\n6.4\n\nLithium-ion Secondary Batteries\n\n6.4.1 Definition\n58\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\n\nLithium-ion batteries are rechargeable batteries and have a high voltage cathode such\nas LiMO2 (M = Co, Ni, Mn, Al, or combinations of these) or LiFePO4 (and derivatives of\nthis olivine material). The anode is usually a form of carbon or LiTi4O5 or lithium alloys\nof Si or Sn. The electrolyte in these cells is made up of a combination of organic\ncarbonates and a salt. The most commonly used salt is LiPF6 (lithium\nhexafluorophosphate). Other salts such as LiBOB (lithium bisoxalato borate) or LiBF4\n(lithium tetrafluoroborate) have also been used. The charge and discharge in the\nlithium-ion cells occurs by the process of intercalation and deintercalation, respectively,\nas shown in the equations on the following page.\n\n59\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

The typical\ncharging protocol for the lithium-ion cells includes a constant current charge to a voltage\nof 4.1 V or 4.2 V (depending on the metal oxide cathode and manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s\nrecommendations) and a hold at constant voltage until the current falls down to\napproximately C/100 (this can vary according to the manufacturer). Due to the unique\ncharging characteristic of the lithium-ion cells and batteries, charging should be\nperformed with a dedicated charger only. This charger may be a \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d charger in\nsome cases. If a dedicated charger does not exist, the equipment used for charging\nshould have adequate controls so as to not impose an overcharge, overcurrent, or\novervoltage condition on the battery. The discharge of the cell depends on the load\nused, but the end voltage during discharge should not go below manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s\nspecified voltage. Typical end of discharge voltages for the batteries in different\nequipment has been 3.0 V/cell. Internal resistance for the lithium-ion cells varies from\n80 to 120 m\xe2\x84\xa6 for low-capacity (1 to 3 Ah) cells to about 0.8 m\xe2\x84\xa6 for high-capacity (190Ah) cells.\nLithium-ion cells typically are spiral wound or prismatic. Under the prismatic types there\nare true prismatic, which are stacked flat plates, and others that are folded over to give\na prismatic appearance. A third variety that is increasingly common in the market today\nis the elliptic cylindrical type, where the spiral wound stack is flattened to give a\nprismatic appearance. Typically, the commercial cells used in cellular phones are\nprismatic cells, while those used in camcorders, cameras, and PCs are spiral wound\ncylindrical cells. Lithium-ion cells have\n100-percent energy efficiency through most of their cycle life (input energy is equal to\noutput energy). While commercial cylindrical cells are either case negative or case\npositive, most of the prismatic cells above 5-Ah capacity are either case neutral or case\npositive.\nCommercial cylindrical cells (e.g., 18650, 26650, etc.) can have three levels of\nprotection. These are the PTC current limiters, current interrupt device (CID), and the\nshutdown separator. The PTC device is activated in the case of external\nshort/overcurrent and over-temperature conditions. The CID is activated when the cells\nbuild up excessive pressure that usually occurs when the cells are overcharged to\nvoltages close to or above 5 V. The shutdown separator is activated when the cells\nreach a certain temperature that causes a meltdown of the middle polyethylene layer of\n60\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

This usually occurs at about 130\xc2\xbaC (266\xc2\xbaF). Not all lithiumion cells have a shutdown separator. Commercial cell designs today have a ceramiccoated separator that is expected to be more robust to shorting events. The cells also\nhave a vent that is rated to vent above 150 psi. However, in most of the cell designs\nunder discussion here, the shutdown separator and vent activate near or above the\nonset of thermal runaway temperatures and are not typically considered to be safety\ncontrols. Furthermore, venting of flammable gases will result in flames, sparks, and fire\nin the presence of an oxygen atmosphere, which in a majority of cases may evolve from\ncathode decomposition inside the cell.\nHigh-capacity cells consist of the shutdown separator, vents, and a fusible link to the\nelectrode as possible levels of protection. The shutdown separator is activated when\nthe cells reach temperatures close to 130\xc2\xbaC (266\xc2\xbaF). The fusible link melts at specific\ncurrent levels, which then inhibits any hazardous occurrences during an external short\ncondition. The vent typically operates above 150 psi, and cells typically do not perform\nafter a vent. These safety features are not always effective at mitigating a safety\nincident.\nThe SOC and temperature at which the cells are stored or cycled greatly affects the\nirreversible capacity loss in the cells. For example, one commercial cell in a period of\nstorage for 1 year exhibited less than a 2-percent loss at 0-percent SOC and 0\xc2\xbaC,\nwhereas it exhibited about\n13-percent loss at 100-percent SOC and 40\xc2\xbaC. The temperature and the DoD to which\nthe cells are cycled also affect the deliverable capacity of the cells with cycle life.\n6.4.2 Hazard Sources\nThe main abuse conditions that cause hazards in lithium-ion cells are the result of\novercharge, internal and external shorts, and high temperatures. Although overdischarge is in itself not a hazard, it can cause development of high resistance and cell\nconditions that can subsequently lead to a hazard.\nStudies have shown that overcharge conditions can lead to the deposition of lithium\nmetal that can create internal shorts in the cell. The electrolyte in the lithium-ion cells\ncontains flammable organic solvents, and under high voltage conditions they\ndecompose, leading to the formation of gases (e.g., carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,\nand other gaseous decomposition products). This can cause overpressure conditions\ninside the cell, leading to smoke and flame if the gases are not vented benignly. Rapid\ncharging at temperatures below the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification can also cause\ndeposition of lithium dendrites. However, lithium dendrite formation can be mitigated if\nthe charge current is lowered per the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification or is limited to less\nthan full SOC.\n\n61\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\nExternal short of lithium-ion cells of the high and low impedance types can also result in\nhigh temperatures and pressures inside the cell, resulting in venting, fire, thermal\nrunaway, and/or explosions.\nThe lithium-ion cells under simulated internal short conditions have shown to exhibit\nventing, fire, and smoke, as well as thermal runaway. Simulated internal short tests can\ndetermine the tolerance of particular cell designs to internal shorts. However, most\nlithium-ion cell designs have been shown to be intolerant to internal shorts, especially at\nhigh SOCs.\nInternal shorts can occur in two ways. One is due to poor quality control in the cell\nmanufacturing process that causes impurities and contaminants to be present as latent\ndefects inside the cell that can later pierce the separator, causing an internal short\ncircuit that can result in electrolyte leakage, fire, and thermal runaway. This cause is\nmitigated by the DFMR approach specified herein. The second cause for this event\nresults from abuse such as overcharge and over-discharge or extreme temperatures.\nInternal shorts can occur when cells are used beyond their specifications, such as\ncharge and discharge rates beyond the cell\xe2\x80\x99s capability, exceeding end-of-charge or\nend-of discharge voltages, and exceeding operational temperature ranges. Such\nexcesses can cause the deposition of metallic dendrites of copper and lithium.\nLocalized intense heat due to impurities or dendrite formation provides the environment\nfor a fire in the presence of a flammable organic electrolyte. Aluminum metal current\ncollector contributes to the thermal runaway of a cell when internal temperatures reach\nthe melting temperature of aluminum (~660\xc2\xb0C). This second cause is to be controlled\nby a failure tolerance approach.\nOver-discharge conditions lead to the electrodeposition of copper on the anode,\ncathode, and separator, causing the formation of a short circuit condition. Gas\nformation due to decomposition of electrolyte under/over-discharge conditions have also\nbeen reported in the literature [32, 33]. In most cases, over-discharge, even into\nreversal, is benign and results in a shorted (dead) cell. However, subsequent charges\nof multi-cell modules with one or more cells that experience over-discharge can cause\nother cells to go into an overcharge condition. The tolerance of a cell to over-discharge\nconditions (voltage, etc.) should be characterized for battery designs before safety\ncontrols are set.\nLithium-ion cells under very high temperature conditions [above 150\xef\x82\xb0C (302\xef\x82\xb0F)] can\nvent, smoke, and exhibit thermal runaway accompanied by fire and/or an expulsion of\ncan contents through the vent holes in the cell or through the bursting of the cell header.\n6.4.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\na.

Within the cells that fall into the \xc2\xb13-sigma range, the following parameters may\nbe used for matching cells: OCV, mass, capacity, DC resistance, and AC\nimpedance.\nh. For custom batteries, the \xe2\x80\x9cas received\xe2\x80\x9d cell OCV measurement is an excellent\nscreen for identifying charge retention (soft short) outliers if the time between the\nlast time the SOC was set and the measurement is made is over 1 year. If that\ntime delay is not possible, then one method for screening cells with soft shorts is\nto deeply and slowly discharge the cells to 0-percent SOC at the lowest\noperational constant voltage set by the manufacturer and observe the bounceback of the OCV over a 14-day period. Declining OCVs from a maximum over\nthe 14-day stand can be indicative of a soft short and pass/fail criteria should be\nset accordingly.\ni.

The\nflight acceptance tests should include, as a minimum, baseline physical and\nelectrochemical tests, vibration to relevant levels (Appendix A) and vacuum leak\nchecks with baseline physical and electrochemical tests performed before and\nafter the vibration and vacuum leak checks. The pass/fail criteria should be\nstringent.

COTS Battery Acceptance Flow\n\n6.5\n\nLithium/Lithium-ion Polymer Secondary Batteries\n\n6.5.1 Definition\nLithium/lithium-ion polymer batteries are rechargeable batteries and have polymer\nblends in the cathode or anode or separator or in all three. In the polymer cells, flat,\nbonded electrodes are used to enable the fabrication of thin cells. The cells could be\nmade in flexible shapes and sizes and packaged in aluminized plastic pouches.\nAlthough the commercial market labels all polymer batteries as \xe2\x80\x9clithium-polymer\xe2\x80\x9d\nbatteries, most of those in the market today are of the lithium-ion polymer type. These\nare called lithium-ion polymers as they contain electrode formulations and some liquid\nelectrolyte that are similar in composition to lithium-ion cells and do not contain a purely\npolymeric electrolyte or lithium metal electrode.\nThe electrochemical nature of these cells is very similar to the liquid electrolyte lithiumion cells dealt with in the previous section. These cells have a LiMO2 cathode (M = Co,\nNi, Mn, or combinations of these). The commonly used cathodes in lithium/lithium-ion\n69\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\npolymer cells are Li-Mn2O4 spinel compounds. The anode can be any form of carbon,\nnamely, natural and synthetic graphites, mesophase carbon micro beads (MCMB), or\ncarbon fibers (lithium-ion polymer cells). The anode can also be lithium metal (lithium\npolymer cells). The electrolyte in these cells is made up of a combination of organic\ncarbonates and a salt in a polymer matrix. The most commonly used salt is LiPF6\n(lithium hexafluorophosphate). The polymers commonly used are based on\npolyacrylonitriles (PANs), PVDF-based polymers (PVDF-HFP, PVDF-CTFE), polyvinyl\nchloride (PVC), etc. In some cases, an ancillary plasticizer such as dibutyl phthalate is\nincorporated into the resin, which facilitates the densification of the electrodes under low\ntemperature and pressure. The plasticizer is later vaporized or removed by a suitable\nsolvent extraction process. The charge and discharge in the lithium/lithium-ion cells\noccurs in a manner similar to that described in Section 6.4.\nThe nominal voltage of the lithium-ion polymer cells with the cobaltate cathode is about\n3.6 V and the energy density obtained can range from 145 to 190 Wh/kg. The lithiumion polymer cells with the manganese spinel cathode have a nominal voltage of about\n3.8 V and have energy densities in the range of 130 to 144 Wh/kg. The typical charging\nprotocol for the lithium/lithium-ion polymer cells includes a constant current charge to a\nvoltage of 4.1 V or\n4.2 V (depending on the metal oxide cathode and manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations)\nand held at constant voltage until the current falls down to approximately C/100 (this\ncan vary according to the manufacturer). Due to the unique charging characteristic of\nthe lithium-ion cells and batteries, charging should be performed with a dedicated\ncharger only. This charger can be a \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d charger in some cases. Lithium polymer\ncells may sometimes require higher temperatures for operation (about 60 \xc2\xbaC (140 \xc2\xbaF)).\nThe discharge of the cell depends on the load used, but the end voltage during\ndischarge should not go below 2.5 V. Typical end-of-discharge voltages for the\nbatteries in different equipment have been 3.0 V/cell. Internal resistance for the lithiumion polymer cells varies from 20 to 60 m\xe2\x84\xa6 for small (0.5 to 15 Ah) cells and is expected\nto drop with increased capacity cells.\nLithium/lithium-ion polymer cells are typically flat and thin. The cells are packaged in\nvapor-impermeable, flexible, multilayer metalized polymer bags. The polymer cells are\ntypically made up of a positive electrode plate and a negative electrode plate bonded to\ntwo opposite sides of an ionically conductive separator. The plates can be stacked as\nindividual plates, Z-folded, or folded in other ways depending on the mechanical\nproperties of the individual component layers. A large-capacity cell would thus have\nseveral plates stacked on each other to give the capacity required. Another common\nmethod of cell stacking is the \xe2\x80\x9cbicell\xe2\x80\x9d configuration, where the central plate (typically a\nnegative electrode) is shared by two positive plates on either side. There is a layer of\nseparator between the center negative plate and the two positive plates on either side.\nSeveral bicells can be stacked to give a larger capacity cell.\nPolymer cells typically perform well at low rates of charge and discharge. However,\ncells can be made for specific medium and high rate applications. Because of the\n70\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

These are similar to the liquid lithium-ion cells.\nThe polymer cells do not have the same safety features that a liquid lithium-ion cell\nwould have. The only safety feature in the cell is the shutdown separator that works in\na manner similar to that of the liquid systems. With the polymer cells, due to the nature\nof the cell design and package, the cell seals lose integrity under abusive conditions,\nleading to electrolyte leakage. But, due to the presence of very little electrolyte\ncompared with the liquid cells, the hazards associated with them are less. The\npresence of the gel polymer can cause a self-healing process in instances of nail\npenetration in a fully charged state and hence reduces the occurrence of explosions or\nfires.\n6.5.2 Hazard Sources\nThe main abuse conditions that cause hazardous conditions in lithium/lithium-ion\npolymer cells are the result of overcharge, internal and external shorts, and high\ntemperatures. These are similar to those for the liquid lithium-ion cells, discussed in\nSection 5.4. However, the polymer lithium-ion cells have additional problems with\nelectrolyte leakage under abusive conditions and corrosion of polymer pouches. These\npouch-design cells are also intolerant to vacuum conditions and undergo swelling.\n6.5.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\nThe controls for the polymer cell batteries are similar to those for the lithium-ion liquid\nsystems. The battery should be failure tolerant to overcharge, over-discharge\nconditions, external short (high and low impedance), and extreme temperature hazards.\nAlthough an over-discharge condition has not been deemed to be a hazard in lithiumion cells, subsequent charges can cause a hazardous condition in one or more cells in a\nmulti-cell pack. The controls and processes listed in Sections 5 and 6.4 (lithium-ion)\nshould be used as applicable to incorporate safety controls into the battery design.\nIn addition, the following should be taken into account while using the lithium-ion\npolymer cells.\na. The lithium-ion polymer cells should be tested in an environment of 8 to 10 psi\npressure for the flight acceptance leak test rather than the vacuum (~0.1 psi) or\ndeep vacuum\n(below ~10\xe2\x80\x934 Torr). In addition, the pouch cell designs should be leak tested with\nthe pressure restraints on the wide faces of the cells to prevent damage due to\npouch expansion. The restraint pressure should be obtained from the cell\n71\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

The cells should be restrained at all times to prevent inadvertent\nswelling during storage, cycling, and low pressure or vacuum environments.\nb. Cells should be stringently monitored for any signs of voltage decay, visual\nevidence of external corrosion, or inadequate isolation of the terminals from the\npouch.\n\n72\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

In most cases, primary lithium cells have a lithium metal anode. Cells of\nthis chemistry have a nonaqueous electrolyte that is either organic or inorganic in\nnature. Depending on the cathode present, the nominal voltage of the cell differs. The\nmost commonly used lithium primary batteries for space applications are lithium\nmanganese dioxide (Li-MnO2), lithium iron disulfide (LiFeS2), lithium polycarbon\nmonofluoride (LiCFx), lithium thionyl chloride (Li-SOCl2), and lithium bromine chloride\ncomplex (Li-BCX). The less commonly used ones are lithium sulfur dioxide (Li-SO2)\nand lithium sulfuryl chloride (Li-SO2Cl2).\nThe half-cell reactions, chemistry, and operating voltage details are provided below for\nthe most commonly used lithium primary batteries.\nThe half reactions for the Li-MnO2 cell chemistry are:\nAnode:\n\nLi\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nLi+ + e-\n\nCathode:\n\nMnIVO2 + Li+ + e-\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nMnIIIO2(Li+)\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\nLi + MnIVO2\n\n\xef\x83\xa8\n\nMnIIIO2(Li+)\n\nThe cathode is made up of solid heat treated MnO2, and the electrolyte is a mixture of\npropylene carbonate or butylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane, along with a salt\nsuch as lithium perchlorate or lithium trifluoroethylacetate (triflate). The OCV of this cell\nchemistry is 3.3 V. The nominal or operating voltage of the cell is 3.0 V. Caution\nshould be exercised in using cells with an OCV greater than 3.3 V. Higher voltages\naccelerate corrosion and lead to significant reduction in the calendar life of the battery.\nThe half reactions for the Li CFx are:\nAnode:\n\nxLi\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nxLi+ + xe-\n\nCathode:\n\n(CF)x + xe-\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nxC + xF-\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\nxLi + (CF)x\n\n\xef\x83\xa8\n\nxLiF + xC\n\nThe cathode is solid polycarbon monofluoride, and the electrolyte is a mixture of\ngamma- butyrolactone with a salt such as lithium tetrafluoroborate. In coin cells,\ndimethoxyethane is also added to the solvent mixture. The OCV is 3.2 V, and the\noperating voltage is between 2.5 to 2.6 V, which drops down further under higher loads.\nVoltage delays are common with this chemistry, especially at low temperatures, and\npredischarge is typically performed to remove this feature.\nThe half reactions for the LiFeS2 are shown on the following page:\n73\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

The\nOCV of the cells is as high as 1.9 V, and its nominal voltage is 1.5 V. The operating\nvoltage range is from about 1.6 V to 1.0 V, and the cells are capable of providing up to a\nC rate discharge.\nThe half reactions for the Li-SOCl2 cell are:\nAnode:\n\nLi\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nLi+ + e-\n\nCathode:\n\n2SOCl2 + 2e-\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nSO2 + S + 4Cl-\n\nThe overall reaction is: 4Li + 2SOCl2\n\n\xef\x83\xa8\n\n4LiCl + SO2 + S\n\nThe catholyte is a mixture of thionyl chloride and lithium aluminum tetrachloride on highsurface-area carbon.

The OCV\nfor\nLi-BCX is approximately 3.8 to 3.9 V, with an operating voltage of 3.6 V.\n6.6.2 Hazard Sources\nLithium batteries have very high energy densities compared with other batteries, as\nshown by Table 6.6.2-1.\nTable 6.6.2-1.

Some of these conditions are:\na. Any condition that results in the lithium anode reaching its melting point of 180\xc2\xb0C\n(356\xc2\xb0F) is a hazardous condition. Discharging lithium cells at a high rate\nproduces heat; therefore, a lithium battery must be designed to safely remove\nthat heat. High temperatures can also be caused by an external heat source, an\nexternal short circuit, or physical abuse (e.g., crushing or penetration by a sharp\nobject) that results in an internal short or a manufacturing defect resulting in an\ninternal short.\nb. Discharging a cell until its voltage falls to 0 volts and then overdischarging the\ncell by forcing it into negative voltage, whether by cells in series with it or by\nanother power supply, can result in cell rupture and/or explosion.\nc. Charging lithium cells can result in cell rupture and/or explosion. Parallel\ncombinations between cells, batteries, and power sources may force a charging\ncurrent through a stack of cells containing a weak or dead cell.\nd. A toxicity hazard is presented by certain lithium cells that contain a pressure\nrelief vent. Cell overpressurization under certain abuse conditions may release\nsuch toxic gases as sulfur dioxide, thionyl chloride, and/or hydrogen chloride,\ndepending on the type of lithium battery, into the space vehicle environment.\nBatteries with an electrolyte toxicity of level 4 should not be used in the habitable\nenvironment (irrespective of size) of a space vehicle. Examples of such battery\nchemistries are lithium-sulfur dioxide, lithium-sulfuryl chloride, lithium-thionyl\nchloride, and Li-BCX.\ne. Internal shorts due to manufacturing defects and/or contamination.\n6.6.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\na. Lithium primary batteries should be failure tolerant to inadvertent charge, overdischarge into reversal, external shorts, and high temperatures.\nb. All primary lithium batteries with capacity in excess of the non-critical limits\nshould be tested for tolerance to internal shorts using simulated internal short\ntests (see internal shorts). Those that are intolerant to internal shorts (i.e., they\nexhibit leakage, venting, explosion, or fire) should undergo a higher vibration\nscreening before flight.\n\n75\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\nc. Lithium cell and battery temperatures should be controlled such that the\ntemperature during operation remains below the manufacturer\'s stated upper\ntemperature limit, for example, 71\xc2\xb0C (159.8\xc2\xb0F) for Li-BCX. Testing should be\ndone to verify safe performance at the operating temperature limits if the\nmanufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommended limits will be exceeded for any application.\nd. Thermal sensors, switches, or fuses set to open at the appropriate temperature\nshould be installed in batteries containing lithium primary cells if the temperature\nof the battery is expected to exceed its safe rating.\ne. Both external and internal heat sources should be controlled in the battery\ndesign, as detailed in Section 5 on high temperatures.\nf. Overcurrent protection devices, such as fuses or circuit breakers, should be\nprovided for lithium cells regardless of whether or not the cells have selfcontained fuses. Protective devices should be rated above the highest likely load\ncurrent but should have a low enough rating to prevent any form of external short\ncircuit on the cell or battery. See Section 4.5 for more details on short circuit\nprotection.\ng. Wherever more than one lithium cell is used in series, each cell in the series\nstring should have redundant parallel bypass diodes attached to them so that the\ndiodes become conductive at the smallest possible negative voltage in order to\nprovide over-discharge protection (see Figure 6.6.3-1). Overcurrent devices,\nsuch as fuses or PTCs, should be in series to the cells to prevent bypass diode\nfailures from causing external short hazards in the cells. In selecting a shunt\ndiode for the battery design, strive for the least negative value.\nh. Non-Critical button cells which are used as backup power sources for computer\nmemories, clocks, etc., may use a high-value resistor to limit a potential charging\ncurrent.\n\nFigure 6.6.3-1.

Batteries that are in parallel with external power sources should be\nequipped with charge-current blocking devices (see Figure 6.6.3-2). (The\nblocking diodes as shown below provide redundancy for both safety and mission\nsuccess if a diode fails open or short-circuited. For just safety, only two blocking\ndiodes in series are required.)\n\nFigure 6.6.3-2.

The cells should be acceptance-tested\nwith weight checks, visual inspection, and open-circuit and closed-circuit voltage\nchecks. For those that cannot be removed from the equipment, a functional\ncheck along with UL (or similar) safety test data should be supplied.\n\nk. All other batteries that do not fall under the Non-Critical category should undergo\nengineering, qualification, and flight acceptance tests for each unique application\nand a unique hazard report should be completed.\nl.\n\nAll flight batteries that do not fall under the Non-Critical category should undergo\nacceptance testing that includes visual inspection and testing for OCV, closedcircuit voltage, vibration to flight requirement levels or higher (Appendix A), and\nvacuum leak checks with weight and voltage measurements performed before\nand after each test.\n\n77\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

All the DFMR measures against cell internal shorts that are required for and\nmentioned in previous sections for lithium-ion (and that don\xe2\x80\x99t involve cycling)\nshould be applied to lithium primary batteries.\n6.6.4 Certification Requirement for Handling Lithium Batteries\nPersonnel who handle lithium batteries or cells at JSC are required to be certified per\nthe Center requirements under provisions of JPR 1700.1, \xe2\x80\x9cJSC Safety and Health\nHandbook.\xe2\x80\x9d\n6.6.5 Application of UL Data\nThe UL conducts abuse tests on several models of lithium cells. Cells that pass the\nabuse tests receive UL recognition (distinct from approval) by cell number. The UL test\ndata can be used as a reference during battery review to determine whether adequate\nhazard controls have been incorporated in a lithium battery design. The use of UL\nsafety test data does not indicate that safety controls are not required.\n6.6.6 Prepackaged Multi-celled Batteries\nThe use of prepackaged lithium batteries containing more than one cell should still\ncontain the necessary hazard controls. Modification of the prepackaged batteries may\nbe required in order to incorporate the hazard controls into the final battery design.\n6.7\n\nNickel-Cadmium Batteries\n\n6.7.1 Definition\nWhile charging, nickel-cadmium cells produce a voltage with a gradually rising slope.\nWhen the cells are fully charged, the voltage begins to increase its rate of rise and then\ndrops off due to the inverse relationship of voltage and temperature in nickel-cadmium\ncells. This peak in the voltage curve is readily detected, normally on the negative slope,\nand the chargers are designed to use this to terminate the charge. Alternatively, nickelcadmium battery charging may be terminated on the basis of an upward break in the\ntemperature curve. A timed cutoff is recommended as a backup for charge termination.\nThe half reactions for the nickel-cadmium chemistry are:\nAnode:\nCathode:\n\nCd + 2OH-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nCd(OH)2 + 2e-\n\nNiO2 + 2H2O + 2e- \xef\x83\xb3\n\nNi(OH)2 + 2OH-\n\n78\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

The electrolyte is 45 percent\nby weight of KOH, which is approximately 6 M concentration. The OCV of nickelcadmium cells can be as high as 1.55 V, their nominal operating voltage is 1.2 V, and\nthey are typically discharged down to 1.0 V per cell.\n6.7.2 Hazards\nSince nickel-cadmium cells undergo both charge and discharge, the battery hazards\ndetailed in subsections of Section 5 should be accounted for in the battery design,\nespecially the hazards associated with gas generation, high temperature, and\ncharging. While nickel-cadmium cells are designed to recombine gases produced\nduring nominal charging conditions, these battery types have pressure relief vents set at\n200\xe2\x80\x93300 psia. This vent is often a resealable type. There are welded seal aerospacetype nickel-cadmium cells without a vent, and these cells are generally used on openframe designs.\n6.7.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\na. The controls detailed in the subsections of Section 5 should be incorporated for\nnickel-cadmium batteries.\nb. The charge should be terminated by voltage slope and temperature sensing or\nby a rigid cutoff time with either voltage slope or temperature sensing.\nc. The charger should be tested under conditions representing the nominal\noperational mode, as well as under reasonable abuse scenarios (i.e.,\novercharge) for the intended application.

This battery does\nnot suffer a fate similar to other nickel-based cells if overcharged or if over-discharged\ninto reversal. Nickel-hydrogen batteries exhibit maximum performance between -10\xc2\xb0C\nand 0\xc2\xb0C with performance dropping off sharply above 30\xc2\xb0C. Operational life exceeding\n60,000 low Earth orbit (LEO) cycles and more than 15 years of geosynchronous Earth\norbit (GEO) cycling has been obtained in satellite use. The expense of this battery\ngenerally dictates its use.\nThe half reactions for the NiH2 are:\nAnode:\n\n1/2 H2 + OH-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nH2O + e-\n\nCathode:\n\nNiOOH + H2O + e- \xef\x83\xb3\n\nNi(OH)2 + OH-\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\nNiOOH + 1/2 H2\n\nNi(OH)2\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nThe anode in NiH2 cells is the hydrogen electrode, which is hydrogen gas in a\ncompressed state and a Teflon bonded platinum black catalyst that is supported on a\nphoto-etched nickel substrate. The cathode is similar to the other nickel chemistries and\nis composed of nickel hydroxide impregnated on a porous nickel sintered plaque. The\nelectrolyte is concentrated KOH, but it varies in concentration depending on the\napplication. The concentration of KOH in a fully discharged cell used for LEO\napplications ranges from 26 to 31 percent, and from 31 to\n38 percent in those used for GEO applications. The nominal voltage for this battery\nchemistry is\n1.2 V.\n6.8.2 Hazard Sources\nThe principal hazard associated with nickel-hydrogen batteries is the high-pressure\nhydrogen in fully charged cells, 800\xe2\x80\x931,000 psia. Internal pressure is directly\nproportional to the relative SOC. These cells are welded seal, leak-before-burst\ndesigns without relief valves and can typically found in open-frame battery designs.\n6.8.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\n\n80\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\nThe nickel-hydrogen cell container is considered a thin-walled pressure vessel and\nshould be designed and certified to leak before burst to ensure that breaching the\ncontainer does not result in release of shrapnel. Special arrangements need to be\nmade well in advance of launch of any nickel-hydrogen battery that will require crew\nhandling. See Section 5.1.1.1 for requirements for pressure vessels.\n6.9\n\nNickel-Metal Hydride Batteries\n\n6.9.1 Definition\nNickel-metal hydride cells became commercially available in the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s as\nreplacements for nickel-cadmium cells. In part this was sparked by new limits on the\nallowable cadmium in the manufacturing work place. Nickel-metal hydride cells typically\nprovide up to twice the capacity for the same size nickel-cadmium cell and experience\nless of the "memory effect" characteristic of nickel-cadmium cells. The voltage and\ndischarge parameters of both chemistries are sufficiently similar to allow the\ninterchange of nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal hydride cells for discharge purposes.\nHowever, the intricacies of the charge characteristics of nickel-metal hydride cells differ\nenough from the nickel-cadmium cells that nickel-cadmium chargers cannot be safely\nused to charge nickel-metal hydride cells in the habitable environment of a spacecraft.\nThe half reactions for the nickel-metal hydride are:\nAnode:\n\nMH + OH-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3 M + H2O + e- (M = metal alloy)\n\nCathode:\n\nNiOOH + H2O + e- \xef\x83\xb3 Ni(OH)2 + OH-\n\nThe overall reaction is: NiOOH + MH\n\n\xef\x83\xb3 Ni(OH)2 + M\n\nThe cathode is nickel oxyhydroxide, and the anode is typically one of two types of\nmetallic alloys. One such alloy is the misch metal type that is made up of rare earth\nalloys of lanthanum nickel (LaNi5) known as the AB5 class, and another is made up of\ntitanium and zirconium known as the AB2 class. Substitutions of the misch metal alloys\ncan be made with Ce, Nd, Pr, Gd, and Y in the place of La. In the case of AB2 types,\nmajor substitutions by the use of V, Ti, and Zr provide improved hydrogen storage.\nOther metal substitutions are made in both cases to suppress corrosion that would\nresult in longer life. The electrolyte is typically 30 percent by weight of KOH. The OCV\nfor the nickel-metal hydride is similar to the nickel-cadmium and is approximately 1.55 to\n1.6 V. The nominal or operating voltage of the cell is 1.2 V, and the cell is discharged\ndown to 1.0 V.\nNickel-metal hydride cells exhibit a gradually rising slope to the discharge curve while\ncharging. However, the negative slope at completion of charge is not as significant as\nwith nickel-cadmium cells. The negative slope may go undetected, especially at the\nlower charge rates, forcing the cells into overcharge. For this reason, chargers\ndesigned strictly for nickel-cadmium batteries cannot be used to charge nickel-metal\n81\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\nhydride cells and/or batteries. The nickel-metal hydride charger should be designed to\nterminate the charge on a characteristic other than the negative voltage slope in\naddition to the negative voltage slope. Chargers designed specifically for nickel-metal\nhydride cells often terminate charge when the voltage changeover time is zero.\nAlternatively, the charge is terminated on the basis of an upward break in the\ntemperature curve. A timed cutoff is recommended as a backup for charge termination.\n6.9.2 Hazards\nSince nickel-metal hydride cells undergo both charge and discharge, the battery\nhazards detailed in subsections of Section 5 should be accounted for in the battery\ndesign, especially the hazards associated with gas generation, high temperature, and\ncharging. While both are designed to recombine gases produced during nominal\ncharging conditions, these battery types have pressure relief vents set at 200\xe2\x80\x93300 psia.\nThis vent is often a resealable type.\n6.9.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\na. The controls detailed in the subsections of Section 5 should be incorporated for\nnickel-metal hydride batteries.\nb. The charge should be terminated by voltage slope and temperature sensing or\nby a rigid cutoff time with either voltage slope or temperature sensing.\nc.\n\nThe charger should be tested under conditions representing the nominal\noperational mode as well as under reasonable abuse scenarios (i.e., overcharge)\nfor the intended application. The tests should verify the successful operation of\nthe charge termination method. An example of acceptance and lot testing of\ncells is provided in EP-WI-014 B.\n\nd. Nickel-metal hydride batteries and cells which fall under the non-critical category\nshould be documented on a Unique Hazard Report which includes UL or\ninternational standard verification evidence.\ne.

The\ncathode is silver oxide on a silver grid that serves as the current collector. Silver is in its\npure metallic form during discharge and is converted to silver (II) oxide (AgO) at the end\nof full charge. An intermediate product that is formed is silver (I) oxide or monovalent\nsilver oxide (Ag2O). The electrolyte is KOH with an optimum concentration of 45\npercent, which is corrosive and can cause burns on the skin and damage to equipment.\nThe OCV for a silver-zinc cell is typically 1.86 V at room temperature.\n\n83\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\n6.10.2 Hazard Sources\nThe main safety concern is electrolyte leakage. It should be noted that if it is necessary\nto top off the electrolyte, one should add only electrolyte and not water, as water alone\nwill lead to degradation of the cell separator.\n6.10.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\na. The controls associated with electrolyte leakage, as discussed in subsections of\nSection 5, apply.\nb. Cells with free electrolyte and that generate gases even while at open circuit,\nsuch as in silver-zinc, should be designed with a relief valve in line with the vent\nport with liquid absorbent material to allow "burping" of gases but to trap liquid\nelectrolyte, especially during the atmospheric pressure changes, which occur\nwith launch and reentry.\nc. Battery cases, such as those for silver-zinc batteries, should have redundant\npressure relief valves. The relief valve on the cell itself can be used as one level\nof control, wherever applicable.\nd. Cell vents in silver-zinc cells should be made out of noncorrosive or corrosionresistant materials. A cell vent made of metallic materials could possibly\ncontribute to the formation of shorting paths. In addition, corroded vents can\neasily plug up, contributing to an energetic release of gases and electrolyte.\ne. For silver-zinc batteries that have a relatively low pressure relief valve, whenever\npossible during prelaunch stowage, the batteries should be oriented "upright"\nrelative to the launch gravity-vector so that any free electrolyte will be forced by\nthe earth\'s gravity and the launch acceleration into the cell away from cell seals\nor vents.\nf. Silver-zinc batteries and cells in the non-critical category should use a Unique\nHazard Report for documentation of the battery.\ni. Non-Critical Silver-zinc batteries and cells should undergo acceptance testing\nthat includes weight checks, visual inspection, and open-circuit and closed-circuit\nvoltage checks. Evidence of acceptance testing should be included in the\nUnique Hazard Report.\ng. For Non-Critical silver-zinc batteries and cells that cannot be removed from the\nequipment, a functional check along with UL or international standard safety test\ndata should be supplied in the Unique Hazard Report.\nh.

Oxygen from the air is required to complete the chemical reaction\nthat produces voltage from a zinc-air cell. The zinc-air battery should therefore contain\nair holes to let oxygen in, yet should also be sealed to prevent the leakage of\nelectrolyte. Using gas permeable, liquid impermeable material to cover the air holes\nmakes this possible. To prevent voltage loss during storage due to self-discharge\nreactions, the battery design should include an air barrier over the air holes (i.e., battery\ninside a bag or gas impermeable material placed over the air holes). Removal of the air\nbarrier when the battery is to be used will activate the cells by allowing air into the cell\nreactions. In addition to these guidelines for zinc-air batteries, the following hazards\nmust also be considered.\n6.11.2 Hazard Sources\na. Hydrogen gas is generated by the chemical reaction between the KOH\nelectrolyte and the zinc anode. The hydrogen generation rate is 0.01 cc\nhydrogen/hr/gram of zinc for 0.5 percent mercury amalgamated zinc at 21.1\xc2\xb0C\n(70\xc2\xb0F), based on silver-zinc chemistry. The hydrogen generation rate doubles or\nhalves with each 10\xc2\xb0C increase or decrease, respectively, in temperature\n(corresponding to a doubling or halving for every 18\xc2\xb0F increase or decrease).\nThe discharge rate also affects the rate of hydrogen generation.\nb. Zinc-air cells and battery cases require air holes in order to provide an access\nport for oxygen, a necessary reactant of the chemical reaction, which produces\ncurrent. The air holes are a potential leak point for the KOH electrolyte. KOH is\na strong base that can be caustic to eyes, mucous membranes, and skin and\ncorrosive to most metals. In addition to the air holes, another potential leak point\nis the gasket between the two parts of the cell can. Also, charging zinc-air\nprimary cells may cause cells to rupture, releasing the electrolyte.\nc. Other causes for hazards for zinc-air cells include short circuits, circulating\ncurrents, high temperature, and charging. The details of these hazards are\ncontained in their respective subsections of Section 5.\n6.11.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\na. Accumulation of generated hydrogen gas should be minimized by providing vents\nin the battery. The air holes, which bring oxygen to the cells, can also serve as\nvent holes for generated hydrogen.\nb. If a ventilated zinc-air battery is installed inside another container, the second\ncontainer should also have a relief vent for hydrogen.\n86\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\n\nc. The air holes in zinc-air should be covered with a material, such as Gore-Tex\xc2\xae\nfabric, which is permeable to air but impermeable to the electrolyte.\nd. The battery case, potting material, and case sealants should be made of\nmaterials that are compatible with the strong base potassium hydroxide\nelectrolyte.\ne. The zinc-air battery design should have controls for short circuits, circulating\ncurrents, high temperature, and charge prevention as detailed in their respective\nsubsections of Section 4.0.\nf. Zinc-air batteries and cells which satisfy Non-Critical criteria should be\ndocumented on a Unique Hazard Report and include evidence for UL or\ninternational standard verification.\ng. Non-Critical Zinc-air batteries and cells should undergo acceptance testing that\nincludes weight checks, visual inspection, and open-circuit and closed-circuit\nvoltage checks. Evidence of acceptance testing should be included in the Unique\nHazard Report.\nh.

Although the theoretical energy density of this battery\nchemistry is at\n2,500 Wh/kg, the practical energy density at 400 Wh/kg is still the highest achievable for\nany rechargeable battery chemistry. This type of battery chemistry would offer\ntremendous savings in mass. However, due to the decomposition products formed\nduring the charge/discharge process, the cycle life of this chemistry at this time is\nextremely limited. The half-reactions for the lithium-sulfur chemistry are the following:\nAnode:\n\nS8 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S8 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S6 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S4 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S3\n\nCathode:\n\nLi2S \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S2 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S3 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S4 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S6 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S8 \xe2\x86\x92 S8\n\nThe anode of the lithium-sulfur cell is made up of lithium metal, and the cathode is liquid\nsulfur. The electrolyte is made up of dioxolane and a salt such as bis(trifluoromethane\nsulfonimide). The cell is initially made up of a solid sulfur cathode which goes into\nsolution when charged. At the anode, lithium is dissolved during discharge and plates\n87\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

The sulfur (S8) cathode combines with lithium to form\nLi2S8, Li2S6, Li2S3, Li2S2, and Li2S. The higher polysulfides, such as Li2S8, are present\nat the higher states of charge. The lower polysulfides, such as Li2S, are present at the\nlower states of charge. The operating voltage range for the lithium-sulfur cell is\nbetween 2.5 to 1.7 V.\n6.12.2 Hazards\nThe hazards associated with lithium-sulfur cells are similar to most other lithium-based\nrechargeable battery chemistries. Under abuse conditions such as overcharge and\nexternal short, due to the presence of a flammable electrolyte and lithium metal the cells\ncan vent and burn until all the electrolyte and active material has been consumed.\n6.12.3\n\nControls/Process Guidelines\n\na. Lithium-sulfur cells should be two-fault tolerant to overcharge, over-discharge\ninto reversal, external short, and high temperatures.\nb. Lithium-sulfur cells should be screened for internal shorts using the vibration\nmethod.\nc. All lithium-sulfur batteries should undergo engineering, qualification, and flight\nacceptance tests for each unique application.\nd. Qualification testing should include vibration to a higher level as for cells\nintolerant to internal shorts.\ne. Lot testing should be performed on 3 to 6 percent of every new lot of cells and\nbatteries procured for the same application.\nf. All flight lithium-sulfur cells and batteries should be from a single lot and should\nundergo open-circuit and closed-circuit voltage tests, vibration to a higher level\nfor cells intolerant to internal shorts, and vacuum tests with functional\ncharge/discharge cycles performed before and after each test.\ng. All lithium-sulfur cells should be transported in accordance with domestic or\ninternational standards.\nh. All lithium-sulfur cells should be visually inspected before removing from shipping\ncontainers.\ni.\n\nLithium-sulfur cells that are warm to the touch should be allowed to cool to room\ntemperature. If the cells do not cool down, they should be placed in mineral oil to\nneutralize the active materials in the cell.\n\nj. Lithium-sulfur cells should always be stored at temperatures between 0 and\n30\xc2\xb0C.\nk. Lithium-sulfur cells should be discharged in the temperature range of \xe2\x80\x9320 to\n45\xc2\xb0C.\n88\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

A lithium-sulfur cell fire should be extinguished by smothering with copper\npowder or with a Lith-X fire extinguisher and should not be disturbed for a\nminimum of 24 hours.\n6.13\n6.13.1\n\nThermal Batteries\nDefinition\n\nThermal batteries are a form of reserve batteries and are used extensively in\napplications that require an indefinite stand time and long life. They are used in mines,\nmissiles, nuclear weapons, etc., where they have to perform on demand. They are\nused in applications that require an extremely reliable battery that can withstand\nextreme environmental stresses such as shock and spin. The battery, once activated,\nperforms at a very high rate for a very short time, typically on the order of a few minutes.\nThe batteries are activated by using a current pulse or by laser activation methods. The\nmost commonly used thermal battery is of the lithium iron disulfide type, which has\nlithium as the anode and iron disulfide as the cathode. The electrolyte is a combination\nof lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and magnesium oxide.\nAlthough the basic unit of the battery chemistry is about 1.5 V, thermal batteries are\nmade with the appropriate stacks of electrodes to provide the voltage desired. The\ndiameter and thickness of the electrodes determines the capacity of the battery, and the\ncapacity is typically provided by the discharge life time rather than in ampere-hours.\nHence, thermal batteries of different voltages as well as capacities can be\nmanufactured.\n6.13.2\n\nHazards\n\nThe hazards associated with thermal batteries are due to the high energies that can be\nreleased within very short periods. Hazards are associated with inadvertent charge,\nover-discharge into reversal, external short circuits, crush, high temperatures during\nstorage, as well as inadvertent activation of the batteries.\n6.13.3 Controls/Process Guidelines\na. Thermal batteries should be failure tolerant to inadvertent charge, over-discharge\ninto reversal, external short circuit, and high temperatures.\nb. Thermal batteries should be X-rayed to eliminate the presence of metallic or\nactivate material particles in the cell stack.\nc. The welded seal of the thermal batteries should be maintained after exposure of\nthe battery to 90 psig for one hour at room temperature.\nd. The voltage of the batteries when measured for less than 30 seconds prior to\ninitiation should not exceed 3 mV. The measurement should be taken with an\n89\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

The insulation resistance of the battery when measured using 100 +/\xe2\x80\x93 5 Vdc,\nprior to initiation, between the terminal and case or between the initiator terminal\nand either the positive or negative or between the positive and negative terminals\nshould be greater than 20 MOhms. Caution should be exercised during this test\nto avoid measurements between the two initiator terminals, as this would cause\ninadvertent activation of the battery.\nf. Flight acceptance testing should include tests from \xe2\x80\x9cc\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ce\xe2\x80\x9d on all flight batteries,\nas well as vibration to higher than typical levels for those intolerant to internal\nshorts.\n6.14\n\nCapacitors/Supercapacitors\n\nTraditional capacitors and supercapacitors are used in several applications as alternate\nenergy sources (in the place of or in conjunction with batteries) for space use.\nCapacitors do not have the same hazards as batteries, but with the advancement in\ncapacitor technology and the invention of asymmetric as well as lithium-ion\nsupercapacitors, the hazards associated with the use of capacitors as alternate energy\nsources may not remain the same as those of EEE parts, especially when used in a\nhuman-rated space environment.\nFor traditional capacitors and supercapacitors used as alternate energy sources, a\ndestructive analysis should be carried out to determine if any excess electrolyte is\npresent. In the absence of excess electrolyte and if the toxicological assessment\nindicates a toxicity rating lower than 2, then only open-circuit voltage measurements\nneed to be recorded on flight units and requires documentation in the Unique Hazard\nReport. In the presence of excess electrolyte (electrolyte droplets visually observed or\nobtained by centrifuging or squeezing electrodes) or if the toxicity rating is 2 or higher,\nthen a safety assessment similar to that of batteries should be carried out.\nAsymmetric capacitors should undergo an assessment similar to that of batteries and\ndepending on the chemistry, the relevant battery chemistry requirements and processes\nshould be used. For example, lithium-ion supercapacitors should be treated in a\nmanner similar to lithium-ion batteries.\nCapacitors that are used in a non-\xe2\x80\x9calternate energy source\xe2\x80\x9d application as standard\ncircuit-board-level components (example \xe2\x80\x9cEEE part\xe2\x80\x9d applications) and that are nonelectrolytic, do not contain free/excess electrolyte, and are not of the asymmetric or\nlithium-ion type are not subject to the guidelines recommended herein. Documentation\nof the safety of these components are verified via nominal hardware testing and\nacceptance processes used for EEE parts.\n\n90\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

Determination of the\nqualification and certification test plan is achieved via inputs from the battery evaluation\nprocess, the intended application, and the program (i.e., shuttle or station)\nrequirements. Typical testing includes functional checkout\n(i.e., operational, cycle), environmental (i.e., vibration, thermal, thermal vacuum),\nelectromagnetic compatibility, power quality, or others as deemed appropriate for the\nspecific hardware and application. The vibration spectrum varies depending on the cell\nchemistry and tolerance of the cell to internal shorts. The safety tests that are required\nto prove two-fault tolerance to catastrophic hazard should be performed as part of a\nqualification test program and repeated for each newly purchased lot of the same\nbattery. The flight cell and battery packs that form the flight lot can go into the flight\nacceptance testing after the qualification test has been successfully completed.\nA.1 Qualification Vibration Testing (QVT) for Batteries Tolerant to Internal\nShorts\nThe purpose of the QVT for those batteries that are tolerant to internal shorts is to\ndemonstrate the ability of the component to withstand the stresses and accumulated\nfatigue damage resulting from the maximum random vibration environment. The test\nduration in each of the three orthogonal axes should be equivalent to either the total\nAVT time the battery will experience or\n5 minutes, whichever is greater.

In addition, air pressure, as used in air knifes and air\nshowers, is an effective alternative method to control mobile contaminants.

For simplicity,\nsingle cells and multi-cell packs will be described as batteries. Both parameters are\ndependent on the battery chemistry. Both parameters should be specified while\nobtaining safety certification for the cells and batteries used for each unique application.\nThe shelf life and service life vary depending on whether the batteries are primary\n(nonrechargeable) or secondary (rechargeable).\nThe shelf or calendar life is described as the life of the battery wherein its components\n(internal and external) have been, historically and by test, proven to be stable and safe.\nThis is provided by the cell or battery manufacturer. The shelf life of batteries is\naffected by factors such as environment and usage. Usage in environments beyond the\nmanufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation can cause irreversible damage to the batteries,\nlowering their shelf life. Table C-1 provides the shelf life for the various chemistries.\nThe shelf life of primary batteries should not be extended, as the components of the cell\nare manufactured to meet only the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s stated shelf life. For rechargeable\nbatteries, this shelf life can be extended by carrying out cycle life testing, as this data\nwill provide adequate evidence of the robustness of the cell components. This testing\nincludes performing at least five charge and discharge cycles on a representative\nsample from the stored lot. If at least 90 percent of the required performance is\nobtained from the batteries, the life of the battery can be extended for\n2 years, and if at least 80 percent of the required performance is obtained, then the life\ncan be extended for 1 year. At the end of this period, testing can be repeated to extend\nthe life again, until the battery is incapable of meeting the minimum performance\nrequirements levied by the project.\nTable C-1. Shelf life of Commonly Used Cell/Battery Chemistries\nChemistry\nLi-BCX, Li-SOCl2, Li-SO2Cl2,\nLi-SO2, Li-MnO2, LiCFx\nLi-FeS2\nAlkaline and silver oxide\nAg-Zn primary\nLi-ion (liquid), NiMH, NiCd\nLi-ion (polymer)\nAg-Zn rechargeable\n\nShelf life\n10 years\n15 years\n7 years\n30 to 45 days wet life\n5 years\n3 years\n3 years\n\nThe service life is the performance a battery can provide in a certain application. This is\nalso affected by factors such as environment and usage. For example, exposure to\nlong periods of high temperatures will cause the batteries to exceed performance at the\nbeginning of life due to the lowered internal resistance at high temperatures but will\nreduce their service life rapidly due to the decomposition of active materials. The\nservice life depends on the application and the battery capacity. For a primary battery,\nthe capacity of the battery should be chosen to provide the required period of\n102\n\nSee cover for full disclosure. Verify correct revision before use at\nhttps://qmsmasterlist.jsc.nasa.gov/Home.aspx/Organization/31.\n\nJSC-20793 Rev D\nperformance. For example, if a primary battery is required to power a device\ncontinually, then the load on the battery and the period it is expected to provide that\npower should be taken into consideration to determine the size (capacity) of the battery.\nWhen obtaining battery certification, both the load and the period of use that reflects the\nservice life required will have to be provided. For rechargeable batteries, apart from the\ncapacity factor, the service life is provided as cycle life, or the number of times it can be\nrecharged. This is dependent on the battery chemistry. For example, some\nrechargeable silver-zinc batteries have a maximum cycle life of 30 cycles unless\nspecified otherwise by the battery manufacturer. Nickel-metal hydride, nickel-cadmium,\nand lithium-ion (liquid electrolyte systems only) have a cycle life of greater than 500\ncycles. Lithium-ion batteries have been shown to provide from one thousand to tens of\nthousands of cycles in portable equipment and satellite systems, respectively. The\nservice life of both primary and rechargeable may exceed the calendar life of the\nbattery, and in those cases the calendar life becomes the limiting factor.\n\n103\n\nSee cover for full disclosure.

This appendix will be used to\ncollect examples of processes used within example programs. It is merely intended as\nguidelines of how the approval process can be conducted.\nD.1\n\nExample JSC Processes\n\nBattery approval should be provided via a signed battery evaluation form (e.g., ISS_EP03 for NASA Safety Panels). The only exception to this is in cases where the battery is\nthe main power supply for a space vehicle that is designed and flown by a prime\ncontractor. In this case, the responsible battery safety expert should verify that the\ndesign is safe through the appropriate safety panel review processes. Approval of a\nbattery design for a particular hardware or mission will not be construed as a general\ncertification for all hardware and missions. Approval of battery usage should be\nobtained for any new application of any approved hardware configuration and/or with\neach increase in scope of its certification. The process for obtaining battery design\nevaluation and approval from JSC is detailed in JWI 8705.3. The safety review process\nfor the ISS and all the visiting vehicles is described in SSP 30599. The safety review\nprocess for the Commercial Crew and Cargo Program is described in the CCT-STD1140 and\nCCT-REQ-1130 documents.
