Part of the payload was the Shuttle Imaging Radar system (SIR-A). The objectives of the SIR-A experiment were to acquire radar images of a wide variety of different geologic terrains around the Earth, to demonstrate the capability of the Shuttle as a platform for conducting spaceborne scientific investigations, and to analyze and interpret the data in the radar images. The SIR-A sensor imaged about 10 million sq km of the Earth's surface. High resolution images were acquired over portions of every continent and some of the oceans between latitudes 41 N and 35 S. The SIR-A incidence angle ranges from 47 deg to 53 across an image swath of approximately 50 km.", "title": "The SIR-A atlas", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T05:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840008337, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ford, J.
