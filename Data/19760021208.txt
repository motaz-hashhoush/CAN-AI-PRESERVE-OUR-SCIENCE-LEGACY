Man has never before undertaken\nanything like this. Where once sturdy seamen and valiant explorers risked years of their\nlives-and their very lives-in a quest for glory, wealth, and the extension of their plitkoreligious beliefs, we now rocket off sensitive electromechanical scouts to do our bidding\nand send back information about the new worlds they have encountered. This is truly a\nnew process, characteristic of our times and skills, ideally adapted to the hostile character\nand distances of the solar system.\nThe Viking lander that began the on-site examination of Mars several weeks ago is\nincomparably the most versatile automated explorer ever built. (Imagine throwing a selfpowered laboratory 460 million miles through space, soft-landing it delicately at a chosen\ns p t on an alien world, and then commanding it to conduct and report on subtle biological, chemical, and physical measurements! ) Seen whole, Viking is by far the most ambitious and venturesome automated exploration that man has ever attempted. It is a descendant of our earlier efforts on Earth to reach the poles or, before that, to cross the unknown\noceans.\n\nWhy do we do this curious thing? W h y is man preeminently an exploring animal?\nPlainly our motives are many, and intertwkd. An unbounded curiosity seems to be part of\nman\xe2\x80\x99s brain, an element in his genetic heritage. We have done this at least since a remote\npredecessor felt a powerful need to see what was on the far side of a mountain. Early\nexplorations were driven by direct self-interest; their goals were trade, land, power, and\ngold. Now we are i m p l l d Oj; motives chat are almost as coolly rational as those that govern the design of our spacecraft: we explore other worlds that we may better understand\nour own. It is still self-interest, in a more intellectual form.\nMars is in some ways strangely earthlike. It is of a size with our planet, has days and\nnights, seasons of its years, and a thin atmosphere characterized by wind and cloudsi.e., weather. By some theories Mars may be a kind of proto-Earth, earlier in the sequence\nof planetary evolution, a place where the geologic and atmospheric processes are far less\ncomplicated than they are on our white-whorled blue planetary home. Thus knowledge of\nMars may have the most immediate implications for bettering our knowledge of Earth,\nand every new insight in comparative planetology may be the greatest of treasures sent\nhome by the Viking explorers.\nJAMESC. FLETCHER,\nAdministrator\nN t o a Aeronatltics and Space Administration\nainl\n\nAugust 16,1976\n\nV\n\nPREFACE\nSOMEmeasure of the rapidity of change in planetary exploration is reflected by the contrast between the 1962 Mariner 2 mission to Venus and the 1976 Viking missions to Mars.\nIn the first case, our first successful planetary flyby, a modestly instrumented probe managed a miss distance of 34700 km and returned several hours of data. In the present\ncase, highly sophisticated orbiters and landers are each day returning rich harvests of new\ninformation about Mars. At this writing, the data stream began weeks ago and will very\npossibly continue for months. Although the Viking spacecraft were designed for 60-day\nmissions, there is no evident technical reason why the exciting flow of new information\nwill not continue a great deal longer than that.\nDuring a mission such as Viking-an\nexhausting if exhilarating time of sleep\ndeficits, quick-looking the data, queuing up for future spacecraft commands, interrelating results from many different instruments, and working around the anomalies\nthat beset the best of spacecraft-it is almost impossible for an investigator to concentrate on thorough and thoughtful analysis of the results received. So this little volume, which includes no information later than August 13, 1976, is not put forward as\n\xe2\x80\x9cinstant science\xe2\x80\x9d but only as a preliminary and tentative account of early conclusions. It\nshould be further noted that the findings reported here are those of the investigators concerned with each experiment. It can be confidently predicted that the views will be refined\nand perhaps extended in some cases when this historic mission comes to its end.\nE.

Like any\nrjc\nscientific exploration, it requires the imagination and labor of a multitude. In the few\nshort weeks that the Viking 1spacecraft have operated on and near Mars, discoveries have\nbeen made that have changed some theories, confirmed others, and, in the tradition of\nscience, opened more questions than they have closed.\nMars has revealed much more variety than anticipated. In the search for the first landing\nsite, photographs were obtained showing some of the most remarkable features carved by\nwind and water ever seen by man. The forces of fluid in motion left an indelible history\non the surface of Mars that will be examined for decades. New features of enormous\ndimension, and always different,were found daily-wide gorges, scarps, faults, flat valleys,\nmottled erosion, ancient shorelines, deep basins, blocky terrain, knobby terrain, tablelands,\nsunburst craters, pedestaled craters, secondary craters, ejecta from c r a t e r s t h e descriptive\ngeology goes on and on.\nOnce cameras were on the surface the pictures revealed a very familiar scene. The Viking 1Lander came softly to rest in a rocky desert with vast sand dunes reminiscent of the\nAmerican Southwest desert. Rocks range from pebble size to boulders several m t r\nees\nacross. Surprisingly or not, the true color of the landing site was red. Everything within\nsight including the sky is some shade of pink or red. Many rocks reveal the weathering of\nwind and time. The chemistry of the loose dirt collected by the soil sampler is an iron-rich\nbasalt, familiar to the geochemist.\nBut the chemical surprises came h s t from the atmosphere and then from &e Sidagical\nexperiments. Before Viking was launched, there was a flurry of interest in scientific circles\nabout the amount of argon in the Mars atmosphere. B c u e of its inert nature this element\neas\nis important in tracing the history of the atmosphere. Guesses and theories as to argon\nabundance hovered around 20 percent. Another critically important atmosphere constituent, nitrogen, had never been detected. Viking has for the first time made direct\nmeasurements of the atmosphere such that now a complete analysis, including many\nchemical isotopes, is available. Nitrogen was discovered, argon and its isotope measured,\noxygen, its charged forms, and upper limits to the other noble gases were measured.\nIn the biological experiments that are still going on, a remarkable surface chemistry has\nbeen discovered. The surface material is highly desiccated but made of minerals that are\nvery hydrated; water is chemically bound but very little absorbed in the surface. The\nmaterial is highly oxidized, appears to have oxygen adsorbed in its surface, and among its\nconstituents are some very strong oxidizing components. All of this chemical activity is\nstill rather mysterious and poses a difficult milieu in which to study biology.\nThe weather on Mars during this summer period is benign by Martian standards: winds\nof only 10 to 15 m/sec and, so far, predictably from the east to southwest. Temperatures\nhave been somewhat surprising; the hottest part of the day occurs in late afternoon. The\nsurface pressures at the landing site were within predicted ranges but have been steadily\n\n1\n\n2\n\nVIKING\n\n1\n\nfalling. This is consistent with an earlier discovery that the winter pole of Mars is now\ncondensing out the carbon dioxide. There appears to be considerable cloudiness in the\nnorthern hemisphere during this time of the year.\nIt appears that the explorations of Viking 1 have already made scientific history. The\nViking Team is anxious to share our new knowledge with the world at large.\nJAMES S. MARTIN,\nJR.\n\nViking Project Manager\nLcrngley Research Center\n\nGERALD SOFFEN\nA.\nV i k i n g Project Scientist\nLangley Research Center\n\n1\nThe Viking Mission\ntions on a global scale with iindings tied to a spot on\nthe surface. The viewpoint and scale are so different\nas to stretch investigators\xe2\x80\x99 imaginations. Patterns of\nvast aeolian deposits seen from orbit can be compared\nwith the shape of aeolian deposits around a pebble.\nInfrared temperature measurements from the Orbiter\nindicate a freezing of part of the atmosphere onto\nthe south polar cap; and at the same time, a sensor at\nChryse Planitia feels the reduction of atmospheric\nmass.\nSometimes the viewpoints are SO far apart they are\nhard to reconcile. The Orbiter sees places where lowlying fogbanks of water ice appear and dissipate\ndaily-while the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s biology instrument sees surface particles that react actively to a whiff of water\nvapor. Plainly Mars is nonuniform; plainly it will take\ntime and thought to understand all that we see.\nDetailed accounts of several of the earliest scientihc\nfindings of the Viking mission are scheduled to appear\nin a series of reports in the August 27 issue (Vol. 193,\nNo. 4255 ) of Science.\n\nProgram Goals\nThe objective of the Viking mission is to advance\nsignificantly \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge of the planet Mars by means\nof observations from h k t i a n orbit and direct measurements in the atmosphere and on the surface. Particular emphasis [is to] be placed on obtaining biological, chemical, and environmental data relevant to\nthe existence of life on the p h e t at this time or at\nsome time in the past, or the possibility of life existing\nat a future date.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBy observing the physical and chemical composition\nof the atmosphere, the daily and seasonal changes in\nwind, temperature, pressure, and water vapor content\nnear the surface, the texture of surface materials, their\norganic and inorganic composition, and some of their\nphysical properties, the Viking mission is enabling\nscientists to define the present conditions under which\nany iviarrian bivivgid processes would have to take\nplace. In addition, the Viking 1 Lander is attempting\nto collect direct evidence as to whether biological\nprocesses are now occurring.\nThe Viking mission is providing information that\nwill lead toward an eventual understanding of the history of Mars. Visual imagery and infrared observations\nof the surface from orbit are revealing the geologic\nprocesses that have shaped the planet\xe2\x80\x99s surface features.\nThey can also indicate past alterations in the composition of the atmosphere and the surface materials. Such\ninformation is, of course, relevant to the questions of\nMars\xe2\x80\x99 evolution as a planet, as well as to bio-organic\nevolution, and also to the development of our understanding of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s place in the history of the solar\nsystem.\nUnlike earlier ventures in planetary exploration,\nViking offers investigators the rich new dimension of\nsimultaneous observation. The added value is immense. Simultaneity gives a chance to relate observa-\n\nMission Plan\nTwo identical Viking spacecraft, each consisting of\nan Orbiter and a Lander capsule, were launched on\nAugust 20 and September 9, 1975. With arrivals at\nMars 7 weeks apart, Viking 1 and Viking 2 will conduct many of their operations concurrently. However,\nthe mission plan allows the Viking 1 Lander to complete its period of high-level activity before having to\nshare the Martian surface with the Viking 2 Lander.\nEach spacecraft arrives in the vicinity of Mars on a\ntrajectory that would take it past the planet. During\nthe approach, the cameras and infrared sensors obtain\nglobal views of the entire disk of the planet in different spectral bands. Then a prolonged operation of its\nrocket engine reduces the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s velocity SO that\n\n3\n\n4\n\nVIKING\n\nit is captured into orbit. The orbit is highly elliptical\n(fig. 1-1). At periapsis, which is placed over the\nlanding site, the orbit is 1500 km above the surface.\nAn apoapsis altitude of about 32 600 km produces an\norbital period that is synchronous with Mars\xe2\x80\x99 sidereal\nperiod of 24.6 hours, so that the spacecraft passes over\nthe landing site daily, at the same local time. Raising\nor lowering the apoapsis altitude produces an asynchronous period that brings a different part of the\nplanet\xe2\x80\x99s surface under each revolution\xe2\x80\x99s orbital track.\nThe Viking 1 orbit is inclined 33.4O to the equatorial\nplane.\nAfter the landing site certification process (described in ch. 2 ) has been completed, preparations are\nmade to separate the Lander from the Orbiter. When\nit separates, the Lander is still enclosed in its aeroshell\nand base cover. The whole assembly is called the\ndescent capsule. Four of the aeroshell\xe2\x80\x99s small rocket\nengines fire to slow the capsule into a descent trajectory. After coasting for several hours, the descent capsule enters the atmosphere and begins to decelerate\nbecause of aerodynamic drag. The aeroshell\xe2\x80\x99s ablative\nheat shield burns away, carrying with it the intense\nheat of entry.\n\n/\n\n1\nAt an altitude of about 6 km, a parachute is deployed to slow the Lander further, and the aeroshell\nseparates from the Lander. The parachute and the\nbase cover are discarded at about 1.4 km, and the\nLander\xe2\x80\x99s own set of three terminal descent engines\nbrings it down to a soft landing.\nThe deorbit and landing sequence is controlled entirely by the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s computer, according to instructions that the ground controllers fed into it before\nseparation. There is no possibility of real-time control when it takes a radio signal 18 min to travel the\nmore than 300 million kilometers that separate the\ntwo planets. At landing, the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s computer has\nenough instructions to operate the Lander and its instruments for 60 days on its own. Once communication with Earth is established, these commands are\nmodified and updated, normally every few days.\nThe Lander receives all its instructions directly from\nEarth (fig. 1-2 ) . The daily rotation of Mars permits\nabout 9 hours for communications. The Lander sends\nits data to Earth in two ways. The transmitter that\ncommunicates directly with Earth can operate for\nabout 70 minutes per day. At a data rate of 500 bits\n(computer binary digits) of information per second,\n\nLander separation\n(minimum coast period, 2.25 hr)\n\nOrbiter at\nLander entry\nLander separation\n(maximum coast\nperiod, 6 hr)\n\nOrbiter at\nLander\nEntry, 250 km\n(BOO 000 f t 1\n\nTouchdown may occur\n\n\\\n\nPeriapsis:\n\n1 to 6 hr from sunset\n\nFIGURE1-1.-Spacecraft\n\nrelationships during landing.\n\nkm\n\n/\n\n~~\n\n5\n\nTHE VIKING MISSION\n\nEarth\n\nOrbiter to Earth two-way radio link\nOrbiter science data\nLander relay data\nEngineeringtelemetry\nDoppler and range signals\n\nLander t o Orbiter one-way relay radio link.\n0 Lander science data\nEngineering telemetry\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nLander science data\nEngineering telemetry\nDoppler and range signals\nCommands\n\n~~\n\nFIGURE1-2.-The\n\nbasic radio links used in Viking 1.\n\na b u t 2 million bits can be delivered each day over\nthis direct link. Later in the mission, increasing distance will cut the data rate in half. A far larger volume\nof data reaches Earth through the Orbiter relay link.\nThe Lander can transmit data to the Orbiter whenever\nthe latter is more than 2 5 O above the local horizon\nand within a range of 5000 km. This daily communication window varies from 10 to more than 40 min,\nand while it is open the Lander sends 16000 bits of\ninformation per second. At the time of this writing,\nthe daily relay communication link has averaged about\n42 minutes. This has permitted the entry of about 40\nmillion bits of Lander data daily into the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s tape\nrecorder for transmission to Earth.\nSince the total amount of scientific information acquired from the Lander is largely determined by the\navailability of the Orbiter relay link, the mission plan\nrequires an Orbiter to be in synchronous orbit over\neach Lander during the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s period of high-level\nactivity. After the Viking 1 Lander has completed the\n\ninvestigations that require a high data rate, it will go\ninto a reduced mission mode. This relieves the Viking\n1 Orbiter of its data relay duties and permits it to start\nits \xe2\x80\x9cglobal walk.\xe2\x80\x9d With the orbital period reduced to\n23.1 hours, the track then walks around the planet,\nshifting about 22.5O westward on successive revolutions. A large number of orbital science observations\nwill be possible of areas that cannot be adequately observed from the present synchronous orbit.\nAt present, the Viking 2 spacecraft is in an asynchronous orbit at a higher inclination, so that considerable global exploration is already in progress. On\nthe assumption that the Viking 2 landing is successful,\nmuch flexibility exists in providing relay support for\neither Lander with either Orbiter. At a later stage of\nthe mission, a plane change maneuver is planned for\nthe Viking 2 Orbiter, to increase its orbital inclination\nto about 75\xe2\x80\x99. This will permit its instruments to observe the north polar region when the polar cap is at\nits minimum size.\n\n6\n\nVIKING\n\nOn November 25, 1976, Mars and Earth will be in\nconjunction, lined up on opposite sides of the Sun.\nBeginning about the middle of November, as conjunction is approached, communications between\nEarth and the Vikings will be interrupted by the\neffect of the solar corona. In anticipation of the blackout, the Landers will be powered down to a safe condition, and the computers aboard the Landers and\nOrbiters will be loaded with sufficient instructions to\ncarry on by themselves. The primary mission will\nhave been completed, but the spacecraft are expected\nto survive the blackout period and carry out an extended mission. The ability to continue observations\nover a full Martian year would provide a very important bonus for several of the scientific investigations.\nMission Operations Strategy\nAs one can deduce from the mission plan, the Viking mission operations are preeminently characterized\nby their complexity and their flexibility. There will be\nas many as four space vehicles operating simultaneously, at a vast distance and with an intricate pattern\nof communication links. The conventional way to deal\nwith this complexity would be to operate in a preplanned, highly programmed mode. Yet, if the scientific exploration potential of the Viking mission is to\nbe fully exploited, the operations must be capable of\nadapting to what is being learned. From the beginning,\nthe planning has been for an adaptive mission. The\noperations organization, procedures, and computer\nprograms have all been designed for the exceedingly\ndifficult task of maintaining flexibility and full control\nconcurrently.\nAt any stage of the mission, there is a current Mission Profile Strategy in being that describes how the\nrest of the mission is to be conducted. As both science\ndata and data concerning the health of the spacecraft\nare acquired, they are used to revise this plan weekly\nin a long-range planning activity. Long-range planning\nis primarily concerned with the period 11 to 17 days\nprior to execution. It concludes with a Science Requirements Strategy that defines the desired mission to\nan intermediate level of detail.\nMedium range planning starts with the Science Requirements Strategy, and concentrates on the period 6\nto 10 days prior to execution. A daily meeting results\nin a Final Mission Profile that lists all mission profile\nevents in time sequence. This is the basis for the se-\n\n1\n\nquence and command generation process, which in\ngeneral takes up to 5 days.\nSome activities, particularly aboard the Lander, need\na faster response. A Lander Science Experiments\nOperations Strategy has been designed to have the general capability to respond to data that arrived on the\nnext-to-last communication downlink for many of the\nLander experiments. (This is, approximately, a 2-day\nturnaround time on selected operations. ) Making this\nvery demanding capability work smoothly has been a\nmajor requirement on the mission operations system,\nand it has been met so well that the operation almost\nlooks easy.\nMission Events to Date\nViking 1 was inserted into orbit on June 19, 1976.\nThe Lander was scheduled to separate from the Orbiter\non July 4, if a landing site could be certified in the\nintervening time. Because the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s visual imagery\nraised doubts about the suitability of the prime site\nthat had been selected before the mission, the separation was postponed to permit the examination of\nother portions of the Chryse basin. A site about 900 km\nwest of the prime site was finally certified, and the\nLander touched down there on July 20. The Lander\xe2\x80\x99s\nlocation is 22.27\xe2\x80\x99 N, 48.00\xe2\x80\x99 W.\nThe orbit of the Viking 1 Orbiter, which was initially synchronous over the prime site, was adjusted on\nJuly 8 to let the Orbiter \xe2\x80\x9cwalk\xe2\x80\x99 westward in the\nsearch for a more suitable landing site. Another adjustment on July 14 stopped the walk, so that the\nOrbiter is now in synchronous orbit over the Lander.\nThis track also permitted the Viking 1 Orbiter to examine a broad area of Cydonia as a preliminary phase\nof the Viking 2 landing site search.\nAt the present writing (three weeks after the landing), all of the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s instruments are working with\nthe exception of the seismometer, whose three sensing\nmasses have failed to uncage from their flight configuration. On July 28, the surface sampler delivered\nsamples of the Martian surface to the biology, the\nmolecular analysis, and the inorganic chemistry instruments. All three instruments have completed the first\ncycle of experiments with these samples.\nOn August 7 the Viking 2 spacecraft was put into\norbit. Its inclination is 55\xe2\x80\x99, and its present asynchronous period of 27.4 hours permits it to explore new\nareas on each revolution.\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe Viking Orbiter: Carrier, Relay, Observatory\nThe Viking 1 Orbiter is the second American\nsatellite to explore Mars from orbit. Like its predecessor, Mariner 9, it put itself into orbit, is examining\nthe planet\xe2\x80\x99s surface with several instruments, and is\ntransmitting the resulting data to Earth. It also has\nsome additional duties to perform, Having carried a\ndormant Lander into orbit, it turned its instruments\nto the detailed examination of the prime landing site.\nWhen that site revealed itself to be more hazardous\nthan expected, the Orbiter was released from its repetitive track to explore a broad region to the west until\na suitable landing site could be found. Its orbit was\nthen resynchronized over the newly certified site, and\nthe Orbiter became the launch base for the landing\noperation. With the Lander safely on the surface, the\nOrbiter has become a facility for relaying data. Its instruments monitor the region around the Lander so\nthat any changes they can detect (for example, atmospheric temperature, water vapor content, clouds, and\ndust storms) can be correlated with the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous observations. Meanwhile, since the\norbital track covers the Cydonia region, the Viking 1\nOrbiter\xe2\x80\x99s instruments are examining the area surrounding the Viking 2 prime site. Other areas of the planet\nunder the orbital track are also being examined. Later,\nwhen it can once more be released from synchronous\norbit, it will carry its three instruments on an excursion of exploration around the planet.\nAlthough the Orbiter (fig. 2-1) bears a facnily resemblance to Mariner 9, the additional functions have\nrequired some important changes in design. The concluding section of this chapter describes the main design features of the Orbiter and its instruments.\nThe three instruments that constitute the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s\nscientific payload are the visual imaging subsystem\n(VIS), the infrared thermal mapper (IRTM), and\nthe Mars atmospheric water detector ( M A W ) . All\n\nthree are mounted on one planetary science scan platform (fig. 2-2), whose orientation with respect to the\nOrbiter is motor-driven about two axes. The instruments are boresighted to point in a common direction.\nWith this arrangement, the three instruments can be\naimed at the surface during much of the desired portion of the orbital period, while the Orbiter maintains\nits solar orientation to generate electrical power most\nefficiently.The scan platform can be commanded to\nlook at any target within view on the planet\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\nIf stereoscopic observations are desired, the VIS looks\nahead just before passing over the site, and then looks\nback at the same area.\nThe VIS consists of a pair of identical cameras and\ntelescopes. Its first, and most exacting, requirement is\nto cover the necessarily large Viking landing sites with\ncontiguous photography in high resolution, so that\ntheir suitability for a safe landing can be assessed.\nvlsuai images obrainrd honi &e pi5zpis ( d i d\nlow point) altitude of 1500 km have a ground resolution of about 100 m. Application of this VIS capability to just a few of the many scientifically interesting\nareas of the Martian surface has already added greatly\nto knowledge of the geologic processes that have\nshaped the planet.\nThe I m consists of a group of infrared radiomR\neters designed to measure and map variations in the\n\nORBITER IMAGING -AM\n\nMichael H.

Variations from\nplace to place under similar conditions of solar illumination can indicate differences in the composition and\nroughness of the surface materials, as well as the existence of areas where internal heat may be flowing\nout. Varfations in the nighttime cooling rate reflect\ndifferences in the average size of surface particles. The\ninstrument also measures stratospheric temperatures\nover broad areas, and their variations with time.\nThe M A W D is an infrared spectrometer that is\ndesigned to map the distribution of water vapor over\nthe planet. Water vapor is a minor constituent of the\nMartian atmosphere that is of the greatest importance\nto understanding the meteorology, the geology, and\nthe biology of the planet. Life on Earth is completely\ndependent on the availability of water, since many\nbiochemical reactions take place in aqueous solutions.\n\n~~\n\nTHERMAL\nMAPPING TEAM\nHugh H. Kieffer\nStillman C.

Later in the mission,\nwhen the Orbiter is in a nonsynchronous orbit, the\nM A W will observe the global distribution of water\nvapor and its variation diurnally and seasonally to attempt to discover the sources and the movements of\nthe vapor.\n\nHow the Viking 1 Landing Site Was Certified\n\nA good landing site is one t a affords a high probht\nability of landing safely and obtaining a surface sample\nand that is likely to provide significant scientific information about Mars and its history. The prime site\nwas in the Chryse plain, near the mouth of the big\nchannel system discovered by Mariner 9. Since the\nchannels appeared to have been formed by running\nwater, it was reasoned that the material at the mouth\nshould represent the material gouged from the highlands south of the basin, as modified by both wind\nand water transportation.\nWith regard to landing safety, it was recognized\nfrom the beginning that any landing without the\nbenefit of visual guidance entailed some risk. The\nViking landing dispersion ellipse (within which it\ncould be expected to land with 9 percent probability) is 100 by 220 km.Clearly, it would be impossible\nto guarantee the absence of landing hazards within so\nvast an area. The purpose of site certification, then, is\nto maximize the probability of landing success.\nThe site factors that affect landing safety are topographic configuration, surface roughness. bearing capacity, and the prevalence of hard surface protuberances such as boulders. The last factor is of particular\nconcern because the Viking Lander has only 22 cm of\nground clearance.\nThe main tool for assessing the site hazards is the\nOrbiter\xe2\x80\x99s visual imaging subsystem. Features that\nmight be a hazard to the Lander are mapped from the\nimages; then an assessment is made of the probability\nof the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s encountering such hazards, given the\naiming errors. Stereoscopic photography by the VIS\nmakes it possible to plot the topographic configuration\ndirectly. The stereoplotting instruments and the photo-\n\nLANDINGSITE STAFF\n\nH. Masursky\nN. Crabill\n\nJ. F. Newcomb\nE. D. Vogt\n\n9\n\ngrammetrists trained in their use are available at the\nU.S. Geological Survey\xe2\x80\x99s astrogeology laboratories in\nFlagstail, Ariz. The problem is the coarseness of the\ndetail at the VIS monoscopic ground resolution of\n100 m, compared to the dimensions of the lander. It\ncan be assumed that a site that is rough on the 100-m\nscale will be rough at the scale of the Lander. Unfortunately, the reverse is not necessarily true. Once\nthe areas that are visibly hazardous have been eliminated, the real usefulness of the VIS pictures is in providing scientists with an understanding of the geological processes that have been in operation at the site and\nin the surrounding regions. A knowledge of the processes permits an estimate of the probability of landing\nhazards far below the limit of image resolution.\nThere are two sources of information about a site\xe2\x80\x99s\nfine-scale surface characteristics. These are the Viking\nOrbiter\xe2\x80\x99s infrared thermal mapper and radar observations from Earth. Their information tends to be cryptic without the knowledge of surface processes that\ncomes from the interpretation of the VIS images.\nThe Viking IRTM is capable of providing information about the thermal inertia of a site\xe2\x80\x99s surface materials. A predominantly sandy surface, for example,\ngets warmer in the daytime and colder at night than a\nboulder field. In the case of the Viking 1 site, unfortunately, the Orbiter did not pass over the area at\na suitable time of day.\nRadar observations can tell something about surface\nroughness at a scale of about 100 to 200 times the\nwavelength of the radar signal, which is comparable\nto the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s dimensions. Plains that show extreme\nradar scattering are often rough on a fine scale. Sand\ndune areas on Earth, for example, exhibit such scattering of airborne radar signals. Since the returned signal\npower is also dected by the nature of the surface\nmaterials, radar data should be interpreted in the light\nof the available geological information.\nRadar observations of Mars can only examine a small\nregion close to the sub-Earth point (the point closest\nto Earth at the time of observation). The rotation of\nMars moves the sub-Earth point rapidly in longitude,\nwhile its latitude travels slowly across the Martian tropical and sub-tropical zones with the orbital motions of\nthe two planets. As it happened, various parts of the\nregion surrounding the Chryse prime site at 19.5\xe2\x80\x99 N\nand 3\xe2\x80\x99 W began to become accessible to radar ob4\nservation just a few weeks before Viking 1 went into\nMars orbit. Observations made a few degrees south of\nthe prime site indicated that the region was somewhat\n\n10\nrougher than the Martian average, but not decisively so.\nOnce the spacecraft was in orbit and VIS coverage\nof the prime site began to come in, it became apparent\nthat the channels, instead of ending just upstream from\nthe site, ran right across it. As a mosaic of VIS photographs shows (fig. 2-3), the channels are incised\nsharply in the surface of the plain, leaving \xe2\x80\x9cislands\xe2\x80\x9d\nto stand between them. The channels provide evidence\n.of a strong northerly flow of fluvial currents that\ncarved grooves and eddy channels in the islands. The\nupstream ends of many islands, such as the one at the\nbottom of the figure, are marked by old craters, whose\nouter ramparts resisted the fluvial erosion. Their downstream ends have the tails that are characteristic of\nfluvial deposition.\nThe channels themselves are marked with irregular,\nblotchy depressions where the surface was stripped\naway by erosive action. Figure 2-4 shows such a patch\nof \xe2\x80\x9cscabland.\xe2\x80\x9d Evidently, the prime site was an area of\nboth erosion and deposition by strong currents. While\nthe site was extremely interesting scientifically, its\ncomplexity made it very difficult to estimate the proportion of the surface that might be studded with\nfields of dangerous blocks.\nProject officials made the decision to delay the landing in order to allow time to study the region to the\nnorthwest where the streams were more likely to have\ndeposited the less blocky material they transported.\nThe area was photographed by pointing the cameras off\nto the west of the orbital track, rather than by shifting\nthe track. The fluvial channels diminished in that direction, and the terrain appeared smoother.\nA new landing zone was tentatively selected, at a\nplace that would be observable by radar over the July\n4 weekend. The observations were made from the very\nlarge radio observatory at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. They\nshowed an area of markedly weak radar signal returns\ncentered at 44\xe2\x80\x9d W, in the zone that was under consideration for landing. Although the exact cause of the\nradar \xe2\x80\x9canomaly\xe2\x80\x9d at that location was not determined,\nthe indication was quite clear that the Lander should\navoid it. Accordingly, the project officials decided on\nJuly 7 to alter the orbit the next day so that the Orbiter\ncould explore further westward in the Chryse plain.\nPhotographs taken by the VIS in the next few days\nshowed the smooth-appearing plain extending a few\nmore degrees to the west before the channels that once\ndrained the highlands west of the Chryse plain were\nencountered. Figure 2-5 is a mosaic of the region,\nshowing the channels in the south and west parts and\n\nFIGURE 2-3.-Meandering\n\nchannels in the northeast Chryse\nregion.\n\nthe ellipse centered on the landing site that was finally\nselected. (The outer ellipse represents the 99 percent\nlanding dispersion probability zone, and the inner\nellipse represents a 50 percent probability.) The low\nridges that twist across the smooth plain very closely\nresemble the ridges in the mare regions of the Moon,\nwhich are basaltic lava plains. On the Moon, the mare\nridges are not as hazardous to a landing vehicle as they\nmay appear-in fact, Surveyor 5 landed safely on one\nsuch ridge in 1967.\nThe Arecibo radar data indicated that the total returned power was up to normal Martian levels in the\nregion to the west of the 44O W anomalous area, and\nthat the apparent fine-scale slopes averaged about 5\xe2\x80\x99\nat 4 7 . 5 O W , diminishing perceptibly to the west. The\nsite that was certified, at 22-4\xe2\x80\x99 N, 47.5\xe2\x80\x99 W , represented a good balance between the visible and radar\nroughness, in an area where it appeared that the surface processes were well understood.\nSome Martian Features Observed b y the\nVisual Imaging Subsystem\nIn the course of surveying possible landing sites and\nobserving additional areas that are accessible from the\norbital track, the VIS has taken many hhotographs of\nnotable features of the Martian surface that graphically\n\nVIKING1\n\n12\n\nFIGURE\n2-5.-Mosaic\n\nof landing site in Chryse Planitia.\n\ndemonstrate some of the processes that have shaped\nthe surface. It has also photographed some distinctive\natmospheric phenomena. A few of the spectacular\nphotographs are included here.\nFigure 2-6 is a mosaic looking across a section of\nValles Marineris, the huge canyon system discovered\nby Mariner 9. The far wall, which is about 2 km\nhigh, has collapsed repeatedly, in a series of massive\nlandslides. The apron from the slide in the center\novercoats previous aprons. The near wall also has a\nfresh-appearing landslide apron. Evidently, collapse is\nan important part of the process of widening canyons\nhere. Streaks seen on the canyon floor point to wind\n\nerosion as an agent for removing the debris. Stratification is evident in the upper part of the far wall. The\nlayers indicate a succession of deposits that might be\nlava flows, volcanic ash, or wind-blown material.\nFigure 2-7 shows a valley whose head (right) is a\njumbled mass of debris from the collapse of the surface. The streamlined forms extending down the\nvalley suggest that here the removal of subsurface material by flowing water may have been the agent of\ncollapse. A possible source of the water is the melting\nof subsurface ice. Near the top of the picture, a sinuous\nrille very much like those that are common on the\nMoon wanders across the plain.

Since that requires the observation of each area at different times of day, data of\nthat type will be quite limited until the Orbiter can\nbe released from synchronous orbit. In the meantime,\nthe experiment is acquiring other interesting kinds of\ninformation.\nA global view is obtained when the Orbiter is well\naway from the periapsis of its orbit. Considerable\nthermal structure is apparent in such a view. Figure\n2-12 illustrates the global surface temperatures ob%\ntained 4 hours before periapsis on one revolution.\nThe planetary disk is half illuminated, and surface\ntemperatures on the daylight side rise to above 240 K\nat noon on the equator. (The Kelvin temperature scale\nbegins at absolute zero, so that temperatures are always\npositive numbers. The gradations are the same as\n\'\nthose of the Celsius scale, and 0 C is equivalent to\n273 K.) The contour (isotherm) interval in the\nfigure is 10 K on the daylight side, and 2 K on the\nnight side. The most conspicuous thermal feature is\nArsia Mons, the southernmost of three large volcanoes\non the Tharsis ridge. It is near the morning terminator, and the high elevation puts the east-facing slopes\nin the sunlight while nearby areas are still at their unexpectedly low predawn temperatures. The comparatively straight isotherms just east of the morning terminator indicate that the temperature rises quite uniformly at first. Toward noon the temperature is more\naffected by the area\'s surface reflectivity.\nAbout three hours before periapsis, the Viking\nIRTM can view the southern hemisphere to the south\npole. These are the first observations made of the polar\nregions in midwinter, and the results are interesting.\nFigure 2-1 3 illustrates the observed temperatures. The\nisotherms are drawn at 10\' intervals down to 150 K,\nand 1\' intervals below that. The lowest temperature\nobserved is 134 K, just off the south pole. Temperatures below 148 K had not been expected, because\n\nTHE VIKING ORBITER\n\n17\n\n&\n\nFIGURE 1 . 4 l y m p u s iMons, wreathed in clouds\n2-1\n\nthat is the equilibrium temperature for the sublimation\nof frozen carbon dioxide at the mean atmospheric\npressure of 6 millibars. At this stage of the winter\nseason, the polar cap of frozen carbon dioxide is\nactively growing, and as much as a fourth of the entire atmosphere may eventually freeze onto the ground.\n\nThe loss of atmosphere is even felt in the northern\nhemisphere, according to indications from rhe Viking\n1 Lander\xe2\x80\x99s meteorology experiment (discussed in\nch. 6). One hypothesis to explain the low polar\ntemperatures is that the active removal of CO:! from\nthe atmosphere over the polar cap substantially in-\n\n18\n\nVIKING\n\nFIGURE 2-12.-Global\n\ncreases the local concentration of noncondensable gases\nsuch as argon, nitrogen, and oxygen in the lowest layer\nof the atmosphere. As the partial pressure of CO2 is\nreduced, the equilibrium temperatures are also decreased. Further observations are needed to rule out\nthe possibility of an alternative explanation, involving\na high-level cloud of frozen COz, thick enough to impede observation of the ground.\nAnother interesting feature in the figure is the\npresence of several temperature troughs, with a depth\nof 2 or 3 kelvins, that appear to emanate from the\nsouth pole. The arcuate shape of these troughs is\n\n1\n\nsurface temperatures.\n\nreminiscent of the shape of weather patterns around\nthe Earths poles. Further observations will establish\nwhether they represent a pattern of the global scale\natmospheric circulation.\nEarly Results of the Atmospheric Water\nVapor Mapping Experiment\nLike the IRTM experiment, the water vapor mapping experiment is temporarily limited in the accomplishment of its objectives by the synchronous orbit\nin which it is operating. In order to i a p the variations\nin the water vapor content with location and with\n\nTHE VIKING ORBITER\n\n19\n\ndependence, the plot shows another interesting point:\nthe apparent independence of the values in a latitude\nband from the time of day. This is somewhat surprising, because at one location ( 10\xe2\x80\x99 N, 83O W ) that was\nmonitored over a local time interval of about 6 hours,\nthe water vapor content rose steadily from dawn until\nnoon. Perhaps the monitored location has a different\nmechanism (such as ground fog) for the release of\nvapor from the solid phase, or perhaps the areas to\nthe west of that location simply have more water.\nObservations from nonsynchronous orbit should\neventually clear up that question.\n\nThe Orbiter\n\n1\n\nFIGURE 2-13.4bserved remperatures of south polar regions.\n\ntime, the experiment needs to observe each area of\ninterest at different times of day. Additionally, since\nthe experiment is much concerned with seasonal variations, an extended period of observations is required.\nThe measurements that have been made to date are\nmostly in the southern hemisphere, which is the dry\none at this season. They show a strong latitude dependence, increasing gradually northward across the equator.\nFigure 2-14 is a map of the low-resolution observations made about 30 min before periapsis on several\nearly revolutions. A water vapor value (in precipitable\nmicrometers, as explained in the instrument description) is printed in the center of each ten-degree square\nobserved. The crosshatched line shows the position of\nthe terminator. (The finer curves are not related to\nthe water vapor values; they are elevation contours on\nthe base map.) The local time of the observations is\nindicated across the top. In addition to the latitude\n\nThe design of the Viking Orbiter (fig. 2-1 ) differs\nfrom that of Mariner 9 in several important respects.\nTo reduce its velocity enough to be captured into orbit\nwhile bearing its passenger, the Viking Orbiter carried\nthree times as much propellant as Mariner 9. The\nstructural augmentation required to support the larger\ntanks resulted in a total Orbiter weight (with propellant and without the Lander capsule) of 2325 kg.\nThe requirement placed on the Viking Orbiter to\nprovide high-resolution images of the Viking landing\nsites has not only determined the characteristics of the\nvisual imaging subsystem; it has caused the use of an\nentirely new type of tape recorder for spacecraft data\nstorage. Whereas the Mariner 9 television cameras\noperated on a 42-sec cycle, the Viking Orbiter cameras\nmust take a new picture every 4.5 sec to provide contiguous coverage of a landing site. This means that\nvisual information must be recorded at a rate of more\nthan 2 million bits per second, and then played back\nat the very much lower rates set by the communication link. The five available playback rates are 1, 2,\n4, 8, and 16 thousand bits per second. This uemendous disparity between the recording and playback\ndata rates is dealt with by recording the visual information in parallel on Seven channels of an eight-channe1 tape. The eighth channel is used to record data\nfrom the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s other two scientific instruments,\nother Orbiter telemetry, and all the data transmitted\nby the Lander in the relay mode of communication.\nDuring playback, only one channel is read out at a\ntime. Even with this approach, the recorder\xe2\x80\x99s mechanical tape drive must operate through an extraordinarily\nwide range of tape speeds. The Orbiter has two tape\nrecorders, each capable of storing 640 million bits\n(55 television frames plus the data stream recorded\non the eighth channel).\n\nVIKING 1\n\n20\n\nLocal time\n\n6:OOa.m.\n\n180\'\n\n10\n7\'\n\n7:OO\n\n160"\n\n8:OO\n\n150\xc2\xb0\n\n140\'\n\n9:OO\n\n130"\n\n1O:OO\n\n120"\n\n11:OO\n\n1 IO" 100"\n90"\nWest longitude\n\nFIGURE\n2-14.-Atmospheric\n\nThe Viking Orbiter needs more electrical power\nthan its Mariner predecessor. The four solar panels,\nwith a combined area of 15 m2, generate 6 2 0 W at\nthe distance of Mars from the Sun. They differ in appearance from those of the Mariner series because\neach is divided into two subpanels. The division made\nit possible, by double folding, to stow these larger\npanels within the launch-vehicle fairing. The Orbiter\nnormally flies with the solar panels facing the Sun.\nWhen it must be in some other attitude, as well as at\npeak-load periods, two 30 A-hr storage batteries supplement the solar power.\nThe Orbiter\'s communication system has a few duties to perform beyond those of the system used on\nMariner 9. It must receive signals from the Lander\nfor relay to Earth. It must also transmit simultaneously in the S-band (at 2295 MHt) and in the\n\n12:oo\n\n80\'\n\ni:OO\n\n70"\n\n2:OO\n\n60"\n\n50"\n\n3:OOp.m.\n\n40\xc2\xb0\n\n30"\n\nwater vapor observations.\n\nX-band (at 8415 MHz). The simultaneous transmission capability is an important part of several radio\nscience investigations. The signals at both frequencies\nare directed to Earth by the high-gain antenna, a\nparabolic dish 1.5 m across. The antenna, mounted on\nthe side of the Orbiter, is motor-pointed about two\naxes. This enables the flight team to keep the antenna\'s narrow beam directed at the Earth despite the\nchanging angular relationship between the Earth, the\nSun, and the Orbiter. The high-gain antenna also receives the S-band signals from the stations of the\nDeep Space Network. During periods when the Orbiter is not oriented toward the Sun, and the Earth is\nnot in the beam of the high-gain antenna, limited twoway communication in the S-band is maintained\nthrough the low-gain antenna. The field of coverage\nof this antenna, which is mounted atop the Orbiter,\n\nTHE VIKING ORBITER\n\nexceeds a hemisphere. The Viking Orbiter has a third\nantenna, mounted on the outer end of a solar panel,\nthat receives the signals from the Lander that are to\nbe relayed to Earth. This communication between the\nLander and the Orbiter is one-way, at the UHF frequency of 380 M H t It was turned on shortly before\nthe separation of the Viking 1 Lander, and operated\nat a 4000-bit-per-second rate until touchdown, when\nthe Lander immediately switched to the normal\n16OOO-bit-per-second rate. (In fact, the Orbiter telemetry event noting this change was one of the first\ndefinite indications of the landing. )\n\nVisual Imaging Subsystem\nThe VIS, similar to that of Mariner 9, consists of two\ntelevision cameras and their associated electronics. A\n\n21\n\ncamera comprises a telescope, a shutter, a filter wheel,\nand a vidicon tube (fig. 2-15). The two VIS cameras\nare the same in all respects, with Cassegrainian telescopes of 475-mm focal length, and identical sixsector filter wheels. The field of view of each camera\nis about 1.5\' by 1.7\', s that from the periapsis\no\naltitude of 1500 km each frame covers an area 41 by 46\nkm on a side. The axes of the two cameras diverge by\nabout 1.4O in the direction perpendicular to the\nground track. The cameras operate alternately, with\nthe shutter of one camera exposing a frame when the\nother camera is midway through scanning its frame.\nWith each camera repeating its cycle every 4.5 sec, the\ncoverage of successive frames from the same camera is\ncontiguous along the ground track. Thus, the product\nof a photographic sequence near periapsis is a swath\n\nCamera head "E" assembly\n\nmera head "A"\n\nBus electronics\n"E" assembly\nBus electronics\n\nFocus and deflection\n\nCompartment\nreference\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7A1\n7A2\n8\n\nL owtion\nBottom\nLeft side\nTop front\nTop rear\nRight side\nRear\nFront\nFront\nBus electronics\n\nFunction\n\nShutter and filter wheel output electronics\nDigital sequencing logic\nVideo amplifier chain\nAnalog to digital converter\nVidicon analog controls\nVidicon power supply\nShutter assembly\nFilter wheel assembly\nLow voltage power supply\n\nFIGURE2-1 5.-Visual\n\nimaging subsystem aboard the Orbiter.\n\n22\n\nVIKING\n\nof contiguous coverage 80 km wide and about 1000\nkm long.\nThe filter wheel in each camera makes it possible to\nselect the wavelength bands in which the image is\nproduced. Imaging of the same areas with different\nfilters permits the differentiation of various surface\nmaterials and atmospheric conditions by spectral reflectances. One filter in the wheel is clear, permitting\npassage of the entire wavelength band, from 350 to\n700 nm, to which the vidicon target is sensitive.\n(Wavelengths between 350 and 400 nm are in the\nnear-ultraviolet, while the remainder of the band is\nvisible.) A red, a green, and a blue filter divide the full\nband into three bands that overlap slightly. Of the two\nremaining filters, the violet filter passes only the wavelengths from 350 to 450 nm, and the minus-blue filter\nblocks those wavelengths while passing the remainder\nof the visible spectrum.\nA shutter allows the image formed by the telescope\nto reach the faceplate of the vidicon during an interval that can be varied between 0.003 and 2.7 sec.\nWhen the vidicon target has been exposed to a light\nimage, it holds the image in the form of a twodimensional array of static charges. The target is then\nscanned by an electron beam that neutralizes the image and converts it to a time-varying signal. The beam\nscans the target in 1056 lines, each composed of 1182\npicture elements (pixels).\nA pixel, a somewhat theoretical concept when the\ntelevision signal is in analog form, becomes a real\nentity if the signal is converted to digital form. In\nthe Viking Orbiter, the flight data subsystem (FDS)\ndigitizes analog information from all instruments.\nIt accepts the signal from the VIS one scan line\nat a time, dividing the signal waveform into brief\nsampling intervals that correspond to single pixels.\nEach pixel is assigned one of 128 discrete intensity\nlevels. Since 128 equals 2\', it takes seven binary digits\n(bits) to distinguish that many levels. Each pixel becomes a seven-bit word when it enters the tape recorder. A frame of VIS imagery comprises 1% million pixels, or 8700000 bits of data. With pictures\ntaken from periapsis, each pixel represents a square\non the surface about 40 meters on a side.\nThe flight data subsystem feeds the digitized visual data into seven data channels of the tape recorder. Successive pixels enter successive channels.\nChannel 1, for example, will record the first, eighth,\nfifteenth, etc., pixel of each scan line. This system of\nparallel recording produces on the tape an intricately\n\n1\nscrambled record of the image. The tape is played\nback one channel at a time for transmission to Earth.\nIt is only after all seven channels have been received\nthat the pixels can be sorted out to reconstruct the\nimage on the vidicon target.\nInfrared Thermal Mapper\nThe IRTM (fig. 2-16) is a 28-channel infrared\nradiometer. Each of its four telescopes has an interference-type filter that passes radiation in a selected\nwavelength band. In the focal plane of each telescope\nare seven antimony-bismuth thermopile detectors that\nmeasure the intensity of radiation in the spectral band,\nor a portion of the spectral band, passed by that telescope\'s filter. The fields of view of the detectors are\nsplayed out in the cross-track direction. A detector\'s\ntypical 0.3\' field of view covers an 8-km circle on the\nsurface from periapsis altitude. The forward motion of\nthe Orbiter brings a ground point successively into\nview of a detector in each spectral band.\nThermal emission from the Martian surface is\nmeasured in four bands: 6.1 to 8.3 pm, 8.3 to 9.8 pm,\n9.8 to 12.5 pm, and 17.7 to 24 pm. Seven detectors\nrespond to reflected sunlight in the band from 0.3 to\n3.0 pm. One detector measures radiation between\n14.56 and 15.41 pm, in the C02 vibration band, to\nmeasure the stratospheric temperature.\n\n.\n6 in.\n\nSpace view\n\n10 cm\n\nElectronics\n\nPlanet view\n\n1\n\nElectronics\n\nDetectors\n\nFIGURE2-16.--Infrared\n\nthermal mapper,\n\n23\n\nTHE VIKING ORBITER\n\nMars Atmospheric W a t e r Detector\n\n.\n\nThis instrument is designed to map the distribution\nof water vapor over the planet. Water vapor is a minor constituent of the Martian atmosphere that is of\nthe greatest importance in understanding the meteorology, the geology, and, above all, the biology of tlie\nplanet. Life on Earth is completely dependent on the\navailability of water, since all biochemical reactions\ntake place in aqueous solutions. The prime landing\nsites for Viking were mainly places where water\nvapor was expected to be relatively abundant. Measurements by the M A W D to confirm this expectation\nconstitute one input to the certification of a landing\nsite. Later in the mission, when the Orbiter is in a\nnonsynchronous orbit, the M A W D will observe the\nglobal distribution of water vapbr, locate areas where\nhigher concentrations might indicate volcanic activity\nor subsurface ice conditions, and investigate the daily\nand seasonal variations in the abundance of water\nvapor.\nThe M A W (fig. 2-17) is an infrared spectrometer operating at five selected wavelengths within the\nwater vapor absorption band at 1.38 pm. By measuring the proportion of the incident solar radiation that\nis passed by the atmosphere at those wavelengths, it\ndetermines the amount of water vapor the radiation\n\nhas passed through. Comparison of the five channels\nalso derives the atmospheric pressure at the level\nwhere the absorption takes place, thus permitting an\nestimate of the altitude of the water-vapor-bearing\nlayer.\nRadiation entering the instrument is focused by a\nsmall telescope and reflected by a collimating mirror\nonto a diffraction grating of 12 000 lines per centimeter. The grating spreads out the spectral band onto\nan array of five lead sulfide detectors. The field of\nview at any instant is a 0.12\' by 0.92\' rectangle, proriding a ground footprint from periapsis altitude that\nis 3 km wide and 2 1 km long. A scanning mirror in\nfront of the telescope sn\'eeps the Martian surface in a\n15-position scan perpendicular to the ground track.\nThe 15 contiguous rectangles covered in one scan have\na combined width of 45 km.

Since the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s mode\nof descent changed several times during the passage,\nand the various insuuments operated through different altitude ranges, an account of the sequence of\nevents (fig. 3-1) is an appropriate introduction to\nthe entry science investigations.\nThe descent capsule that separated from the Orbiter\nconsisted of the Lander, an aeroshell, and a base cover.\nThe Lander was enclosed, the deorbit engines and the\ninstruments that first sensed the environment were\npart of the aeroshell, and the parachute was in the\ncover.\nThe descent trajectory first took the capsule through\nthe undisturbed interplanetary medium. This is a\nmqpecized gzs of ions and electrons streaming away\nfrom the Sun at hypersonic velocity, which is called\nthe solar wind. Closer to the planet the Lander passed\nthrough a disturbed region where the solar wind is\ndiverted to flow around the planet. Beneath this interaction region lies the Martian ionosphere, a zone of\ncharged particles generated by photo-ionization of\nthe Martian atmosphere. The retarding potential analyzer that analyzed the charged particles (electrons\nand ions) was turned on shortly after deorbit. At that\ntime the aeroshell was facing away from the Sun so\nthat the instrument, which was sensitive to sunlight,\ncould observe the interaction region without interference.\nThe descent capsule encountered an appreciable\natmosphere at about 250 km. In preparation for this,\nthe upper atmosphere mass spectrometer was turned\non early to allow it to warm up, and the capsule was\noriented so that the aeroshell and its heat shield faced\nin the direction of travel. The capsde was traveling at\n\nENTRY SCIENCETEAM\nAlfred 0. C. Nier\nWilliam B. Hanson\nMichael B. McElroy\n\nAlfred %if\xe2\x82\xac\nNelson W. Spencer\n\nabout 16000 km/hr before atmospheric drag began\nto slow it. The intense heat generated by the atmospheric drag was carried away from the aeroshell by\nthe ablation of the heat shields substance. Both insuuments ceased operating at about 100 km,where the\natmospheric pressure exceeds 0.003 millibar. The aeroshell\xe2\x80\x99s other two instruments, a pressure and a temperature sensor, continued to operate until the aeroshell\nitself was jettisoned.\nThe capsule experienced its peak deceleration somewhere between 24 and 30 km above the surface. For\na while its path leveled off into horizontal flight\nbecause of the aerodynamic lift provided by the aeroshell. Continued deceleration caused the capsule to\nresume its descent. By the time its radar altimeter\nindicated an altitude of 6.4 km, it was traveling slowly\nenough (an estimated 1600 km/hr) to deploy a parachute. Seven seconds after parachute deployment, the\naeroshell separated from the Lander. The aeroshelI\xe2\x80\x99s\nremaining lift caused it to drift well away from the\nlanding site.\nTemperature and pressure sensors on the bottom\nof the Lander were then exposed to the atmosphere\nand took over the measurement functions. The radar\naltimeter switched to an antenna on the Lander to\ncontinue its measurements. The Lander\xe2\x80\x99s three legs\nwere extended to the landing position. About a minute later the parachute slowed the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s fall to\nabout 60 m/sec. During this time the effects of winds\non the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s horizontal travel could be observed.\nThen a signal from the radar altimeter at 1200 m\n25\n\n26\n\nVIKING\n\n1\n\ner\n\n6400 m\n\nFIGUREj-l.-Diagram\n\n\\\n\nEntry to landing\n6 to 13 min\n\nof sequence of landing events (not to scale).\n\nignited the Lander\'s three terminal descent engines\nand caused the jettison of the parachute and the base\ncover.\nRetarding Potential Analyzer\nThis instrument measured the energy distribution\nof solar wind electrons and ionospheric photoelectrons,\nthe temperatures of the electrons in the ionosphere,\nand the composition, concentrations, and temperatures\nof positive ions. At the highest altitudes, the analyzer\nexamined the interaction of the solar wind with the\nupper atmosphere. This information is likely to be\nimportant to the understanding of the nature of the\nMartian atmosphere, because the planet\'s weak (or\nnonexistent ) magnetic field should permit deeper\nsolar wind penetration than occurs on Earth.\nData obtained by the retarding potential analyzer\n\nduring the descent of the Viking 1 Lander show that\nthe major cqnstituent of the Martian ionosphere is\n0 ~ (singly ionized molecular oxygen). It is about\n+\nnine times as abundant as COz\' (singly ionized\ncarbon dioxide), which is the primary ion produced\nby the interaction of sunlight with the Martian atmosphere. This important new finding lends support to\ntheoretical analyses by M. B. McElroy and J. C.\nMcConnell that called attention to the reaction of\natomic oxygen with C02\' that would produce carbon\nmonoxide and the more stable ion, Oz+. The temperature of the observed ions at an altitude of 130 km\nwas about 160 K.\nThe retarding potential analyzer (RPA) consisted\nof a series of six wire grids located behind an opening\nat the front of the aeroshell and in front of an electrometer collector (fig. 3-2 ) .#The first, second, and\n\nENTRY AND LANDING\n\n27\n\nin a retarding voltage sweep a measurement of the\nelectrometer current took place, scientists can determine the temperature and concentration of various\nions and electrons.\n\nas\nUpper Atmosphere M s Spectrometer\n\nFront face\n\nElectrometer\ncircuit boards\nr\n\nc\n\n0\n\nc\n\n0\nC\n\ns\n\nRetarding grids\nSuppressor grid\nShield grid\n\nFIGURE 3-2.--Schematic\n\nI\ndiagram of the retarding potential\nanalyzer.\n\nsixth grids were grounded to the aeroshell The third\nand fourth grids were connected electrically and made\nup the retarding grid. The electric potential on\nthe retarding grid was swept through a series of positive and negative voltages. During the sweeps, a steady\nvoltage of opposite sign was applied to the fifth, or\nsuppressor, grid. As the voltage was varied, different\nportions of the population of ions and electrons could\npenetrate the grid structure and produce a current in\nthe electrometer. The cycle of voltage sweeps was\nrepeated every four seconds. By knowing at what point\n\nThis instrument analyzed the molecular composition\nof the atmosphere during entry. It provided a qualitative and quantitative analysis of all electrically neutral\ngases whose molecular weight is 50 atomic mass units\nor less. It also measured their isotopic abundances. A\nknowledge of the identities and concentrations of the\nvarious gases as a function of altitude is basic to understanding the development of the atmosphere and\nthe processes that maintain the present balance.\nThe upper atmosphere mass spectrometer obtained\ndata from 230 km to 100 km during the descent of\nthe Viking 1 landing capsule. Figure 3-3 is a sample\nmass spectrum obtained at an altitude of about 135\nkm.As expected, the main neutral constituent of the\nupper atmosphere is carbon dioxide, which produces\nthe peak at mass 44.The abundance of nitrogen, which\nshows up at mass 28 (along with carbon monoxide)\nand at m s 14, is 6 percent that of COz at that\nas\naltitude. The peaks at 40 and 20 are due to argon,\nwhose abundance relative to COZis 1.5 percent. Molecular oxygen, at mass 32, constitutes about 0.3 percent.\nAtomic oxygen is detectable at mass 16. Smaller peaks\nin the spectrum are produced by gases containing the\nless common isotopes of these elements. The relative\nabundances of the carbon and oxygen isotopes are\nclose to their terrestrial d u e s .\nNitrogen was detected in the Martian atmosphere\nfor the first time during the Viking 1 entry. The\nexistence of nitrogen is significant because at least\na small quantity of that etement has always been\nregarded as necessary for the existence of life. Mass\nspectra obtained at higher altitudes show a higher\nproportion of nitrogen, which is lighter than the other\natmospheric gases.\nThe measured abundance of argon indicates that\nthe much higher values that had been inferred from\nindirect data obtained by the Soviet Mars 6 probe\nwere incorrect. This finding was of immediate practical importance because it resolved a dilemma as to\nthe conduct of a Lander scientific investigation. The\nlow argon abundance measured during entry permitted\nthe investigators to use the gas chromatograph mass\nspectrometer (described in ch. 7) to d y ~ the une\ncontaminated gases at the bottom of the atmosphere\n\n28\n\nVIKING\n\n1\n\n10-8\n\n10-\xe2\x80\x990\nQ\ni\n\ng\n\n;\na\n\n10-\xe2\x80\x992\n\n10-14\n\nI\nDecreasing mass\n\nFIGURE\n3-3.-Mass\n\n-\n\nspectrum obtained at about 135 km.\n\nbefore loading it with a sample of surface material\nfor organic analysis.

Some of\nI\n\ni\nIon collectors\n(measures\nnumber of\n\nI\n\nthe ions are products of the dissociation of gas molecules by the electron beam. The ions are then accelerated toward the analyzers by a voltage that is varied\nwith time. The voltage between the plates of the\nelectric analyzer is varied concurrently with the accelerator voltage sweep. After leaving the electric, analyzer, the ions pass between the poles of a magnet\nfollowing curved paths. The path through the magnetic analyzer of an ion that was accelerated by some\ngiven voltage depends on its mass-to-charge ratio.\nMass spectra are obtained at the two fixed ion collector slits by the sweep of the accelerating voltage. A\nmass spectrum is shown as a plot of the quantity of\nions collected at each mass-to-charge ratio.\nThe intake port of the UAMS is at the surface of\nthe aeroshell. It was covered by a protective seal before\nthe Viking launch, and a vacuum was maintained in\nthe instrument until the seal was removed just after\nthe deorbit burn. A mass spectrometer can only operate under near-vacuum conditions; hence the UAMS\nbecame inoperable below about 100 km.\nLower Atmosphere Structure Experiment\n\n(measures\nmass)\n\n1\n\n1\nFIGURE3-4.-Schematic\n\nof the upper atmosphere mass\nspectrometer.\n\nThe primary objective of this experiment was to\nobtain vertical profiles of the density, pressure, and\ntemperature of the atmosphere from an altitude of\n90 km down to the surface.

Because of the very high initial velocities, the pressure\nsensor actually measured the stagnation pressure (the\npressure of the atmospheric molecules against the\naeroshell surface), from which the ambient pressure\ncould be derived later. Similarly, the temperature\nprobe, located near the aeroshell\'s outer rim, measured\nthe recovery temperature of molecules flowing around\nthe aeroshell. During the parachute descent, after the\naeroshell had been jettisoned and the Lander\'s own\nsurface environment pressure and temperature sensors\nwere operating, the velocity was low enough to make\nthe dynamic correction of the readings negligible.\nThe altitude information needed for the consuuction of profiles came from the radar altimeter. A byproduct of the radar altimeter measurements was information about the terrain elevation profile under\nthe Lander\'s path. The terminal descent and landing\nradar, which provided control information for the\nfinal phase of the landing, also measured the drift of\nthe Lander with the wind during the parachute\ndescent.\nFigure 3-5 shows the atmospheric pressure profile\nfrom 90 km to ground level derived from the h s t\nanalysis of the Viking 1 landing data. The points\nderived from the deceleration data and the stagnation\npressures are indicated. They are consistent with each\nother and with the directly sensed measurements \'Mow\n3.5 km. The pressure at the surface was 7.3 millibars.\nThe temperature of the atmosphere between 200\nand 140 km,obtained from the RPA and UAMS data,\naverages about 180 K. The temperature profile from\n90 km to the ground is shown in figure 3-6. The Viking 1 curve is derived from deceleration data between\n90 and 30 km, and from direct sensing below 3.5 km.\nThere are local temperature peaks at 64 and 30 km.\nThe entire profile was above the condensation boundary of carbon dioxide (also shown) at the time of\nentry.\n\nI\n\nOn the Surface: A Look hound\nThe function of the Viking Lander is to enable its\nset of instruments to carry out experiments and observations on the Martian surface. After it has brought\nthe instruments safely to the selected site, it must\nmaintain a favorable environment for them, it must\nexecute complicated instructions for their operation,\nand then it must transmit the resulting data in properly arranged form back to the earthbound scientists.\nThere is one important thing it must not do: bring\nlife to the planet in the form of terrestrial microorganisms.\nThe Lander\'s body is basically a hollow six-sided\nbox, about 0.5 m thick and 1.5 m wide, that provides\na controlled environment for four of the instruments\nand for much of the equipment that supports and\ncontrols all of them. The box has three long and three\nshort sides, s that it looks like a triangle with blunted\no\nvertices. The landing legs, which are attached outside\nthe short sides, give the Lander a ground clearance of\n22 cm.\nWhen the Lander is seen from above, its basic shape\nis obscured by a cluttered superstructure that includes\nsuch components as the terminal descent engines, the\ntanks that contained their propellant, and the two\npower generators in their wind covers. The remaining\nprotuberances and appendages, which relate to the\nscience instruments and their data, are labeled in figure 4 1 .\nThe electrical power for operating the Lander\ncomes from a pair of 35-W radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG ) . Each generator contains a\nbank of thermoelectric elements that convert the temperature difference between their ends into electrical\npower. The source of heat for an RTG is the radioactive decay of plutonium-238. Unconverted heat is conveyed by a thermal switch to the interior of the Lander\nbody as needed to maintain the internal temperature during the night. The wind covers over the RTGs\n\nconserve heat for this purpose during periods of high\nwinds. At times of high activity, the 70 available\nwatts are supplemented by four nickel-cadmium batteries inside the Lander body. The batteries were\ndeveloped especially for the Viking Lander, as they\nare the first of this type that can withstand the j i d\nsterilization treatment that the entire Lander was subjected to before launch: 40 hours in an oven at a temperature of 113" C.\nThe operation of all the equipment aboard the\nLander is controlled by the guidance, control, and\nsequencing computer (GCSC). By the time the Lander reaches the ground, the GCSC has accomplished its\nmost time-critical task, but it still must run all the\nsurface activities. The GCSC has two identical generalpurpose computer channels, each possessing a platedwire 18000-word memory. One channel is operational, and the other is in reserve. The operational\nchannel executes its stored instructions in sequence,\nand it decodes and stores new commands from Earth.\nIt also checks its own condition periodically. If its\nstatus should become unsatisfactory during the mission, the GCSC would automatically switch over to\nthe reserve channel. It would then do just what a\nhuman controller should do under those circumstances: shut down all nonessential activities and call\nfor help. Help would come in the form of new commands from Earth. In about a week the operations\ncrew could convey s d c i e n t instructions to the new\nGCSC channel to enable it to carry on a science\nmission.\nThree units within the Lander\'s body handle the\nflow of scientific data from the various instruments.\nThese are the data acquisition and processing unit\n(DAPU) ,a data storage memory, and a tape recorder.\nThe DAPU collects the engineering and scientific\ndata, converts any analog information to a digital format, and feeds it as required to the data storage\n\n32\n\nVIKING\n\n/\n\nRadioscience\n\n\\\n\n1\n\nS-band high gain\nantenna (direct)\nMagnifying mirror\nCamera test tar\n\nMeteorology sensors\n\nUHF antenna (relay)\n\nboom assembly\n\nrnally mounted:\nBiology\nGas chrornatographmass spectrometer\nX-ray fluorescence spectromet\nPressure sensor\n\niology processor\n\nFurlable boom\nCollector head\n\n~~\n\nFIGURE .-External\n4-1\n\nfeatures of the Viking Lander.\n\nmemory for short-term storage, to the tape recorder\nfor longer-term storage, or to one of the transmitters\nfor either direct or relayed transmission to Earth.

It was apparent that\nthe Martian surface at the site is strewn with both\nblocky and angular rocks in a granular matrix of fine\nmaterial, and that some of the granular material has\nbeen transported by winds.\nThe first photograph shows that footpad 3 barely penetrated the surface, and that some fine particles were\ndeposited inside the footpad\'s concave upper surface\nas a result of the landing. It is most likely that the\ndark band near the left edge of the picture is due to\nthe temporary shadorving of the site (for a few tens\nof seconds) by a cloud of dust raised b, the landing.\n:\nThe camera builds up its picture as a left-to-right\nsequence of rapid vertical scans (see the camera\ndescription in a later section). so rhe time during\nwhich the scene was darkened is readily estimated.\n\nFIGURE4-3.-Panorama\n\nThe area to the left of the dark band includes rocks\nwith wind-deposited tails of fine granular material.\nShadow in the photograph show visible detail, mainly\ndue to the scattering of light in the atmosphere.\nA color photograph taken the day after the landing\nshowed that the fine, granular material is colored rustred, and most of the rocks are coated with a stain of\nthe same color. Some of the rock exposures are darker\nand appear less red. The Martian sky is bright (particularly in the direction of the Sun), and is colored\na creamy pink. Apparently, the atmosphere carries\nmany very fine particles (on the order of 1 p n ) in suspension: and chis dust is predominantly red: Le., it\nabsorbs blue light.

The middle third of this panorama covers a\nportion of the landscape not visible to camera 2, while\nthe left and right thirds provide stereoscopic coverage\nof the duplicated terrain. Looking from left to right,\nthe Lander parts include the windscreen covering one\nradioisotope thermoelectric generator, with painted\nAmerican flag and Bicentennial emblem; the flattopped housing of the seismometer; a grid painted on\nthe Lander\xe2\x80\x99s deck to monitor dust accumulation; the\nstruts that support the high gain antenna; the second\nRTG windscreen; the stroke gage of a landing leg;\nand the meteorology boom. The sky brightens in the\nSun\xe2\x80\x99s direction, at the left and far right. A horizontal\ncloud layer is visible halfway between the horizon and\nthe top of the picture. The landscape is gently undulating, with several apparently shallow craters in the\n\nFIGURE4-4.-Landing\n\nmiddle distance and near the horizon, which is about\n3 km away. Angular rocks with a variety of texturessome pitted, some striated, some fine-grained and apparently dense-litter the surface. The large boulder\nto the left of the meteorology boom is about 8 m from\nthe camera, and measures about 1 by 3 m. The surface\nto the right of it is covered with dunes of windblown material. (This dune field is displayed strikingly on the title page.) The rock-free area just to the\nright of the meteorology boom\xe2\x80\x99s deployment hinge\nwas selected as the site for collecting the first surface\nsample, and it was studied stereoscopically in order to\nprovide detailed instructions for the surface sampler.\nFigure 4-4 shows the site as photographed by the\ntwo cameras on the first- and third-day panoramas.\nThe white lines are a grid of profiles generated by a\ncomputer in response to the control motions of a\n\nsite as photographed by both cameras. White lines are part of a photogrammetric study.\n\nphotogrammetrist who observed the pair stereoscop\nically. The instructions for the surface sampler operation were based on the fourth profile from the left.\nThe removal and deposition of the fine material by\nwind action in the neighborhood of variously shaped\nrocks is exhibited in figure 4-5. The surface of fine\nmaterial is hollowed out where the upwind face of a\nrock presents a sharp obstacle to the wind. Wind\nstagnation on the leeward side of rocks causes the\ndeposition of taillike ridges. Evidently, the winds that\nare strong enough to move these particles have a prevailing direction, from northeast to southwest.\nThe winds that the meteorology experiment has\nmeasured since the landing have not moved particles\nin the size range visible to the cameras. From time to\ntime, the cameras are operated in the single-line-scan\nmode in order to detect the motion of wind-blown\nparticles, or possibly moving organisms. The right side\nof figure 4-6 illustrates this mode. The camera maintains a fixed azimuth while one line is repetitively\nscanned. If anything moved across the line of the\ncamera\xe2\x80\x99s scan, the variation from left to right would\nshow up prominently. To date, nothing has been seen\nto move, If strong winds should occur at the Lander\nsite during the mission, a combination of the singleline-scan camera operation and the meteorology data\ncould determine the wind velocity necessary to transport these panicles.\nAstronomical observations also employ the singleline-scan mode to determine the elevations and times\nof transit of the Sun and the two satellites Phobos\nand Deimos.\nThe imaging investigation has been providing support for other Lander investigations, both with\nplanned sequences of photography and with photographs made specially to help solve the problems that\nhave arisen. Examples of such support photography\nare in the chapters covering those investigations.\n\nFIGURE 4-5.-Effeas\n\nof wind on fine surface material.\n\nLander Camera System\nTwo identical cameras are positioned on short\nmasts atop the Lander (fig. 4-1), about 80 cm apart.\nFrom their viewpoints 1.3 m above the surface, they\nhave a clear view of the area that the surface sampler\ncan reach.\nThey are facsimile cameras, operating on the principle used for many years to scan news photographs\nfor transmission by radio or telephone lines. The\nprinciple is fundamentally different from that of the\ntelevision cameras in the Viking Orbiter. In a tele-\n\nFIGURE 4-6.-Single-line-scan\n\nmode is shown at right.\n\n36\n\nVIKING\n\nvision camera, a complete two-dimensional image\nthat has been produced on a photosensitive target is\nread off, one picture element (pixel) at a time, by\nthe scan of an electron beam. In a facsimile camera,\nthe sensor can only see one pixel at a time, and the\nimage is presented to the sensor piecemeal by mechanical or optical-mechanical scanning.\nFigure 4-7 illustrates the basic operation. The scene\noutside the camera is scanned in elevation by the nodding of a mirror. Each time the mirror nods, the pixels\nalong one vertical scan line are presented successively\nto the sensor. The entire camera then rotates through\na very small angle in azimuth, so that the line scanned\nby the next nod of the mirror adjoins the line previously scanned. Only when the pixels are assembled\nback on Earth by successive exposure along scan lines\non a film is an image formed.\nThe actual configuration of a Lander camera is indicated in figure 4-8. The design reflects concern with\nprotection from the environment-temperature extremes and wind-blown sand. The camera and the\nmast on which it is mounted are covered with several\nlayers of thermal insulation. The only gap in the insulation is the slit over the entrance windows that\nadmits light to the scanning mirror. To survive dust\nstorms, the camera can be rotated so that the slit is\nunder a narrow post that serves as a dust cover. Because of the post, the camera\'s field is reduced to\n342.5\' in azimuth. Since there may be suspended dust\n\nc\n\ntelemetry\nline/\n\nrum\n\nFIGURE\n4-7.-Basic\n\nprinciples of the Lander camera.\n\n1\nScanning\nmirror and\nelevation\ndrive\nOptics\n\n-\n\n-\n\nPhoto\nsensor\narray\n\n-\n\nFIGURE\n4-8.4onfiguration of the Lander camera.\n\nduring much of the time the camera is operating,\nthere are two entrance windows. If the outer window\nis degraded by dust erosion, it can be swung out of\nthe way to expose a second window. Dust that settles\non the window can be blown off by brief jets of pressurized carbon dioxide.\nInstead of a single light sensor, the Lander camera\nhas an array of twelve tiny sensors in the focal plane\nof the optical system. Each sensor is a solid-state\nphotosensitive diode. All the diodes see the same\nscene, but during a scan the system is processing electrical signals from a single diode. The selection of\nsensor signals for processing depends on the mode in\nwhich the camera is operating.\nFour sensors are available for the high-resolution\nmode. They are located at different distances along\nthe optical axis, so that the entire scene from 1.7 m\nto infinity is in sharp focus on one or another sensor.\nThese diodes have panchromatic sensitivity, and their\nfields are limited by pinhole apertures to 0.04O. At\nthat field angle a pixel covers 2 mm at a distance of\n3 m. In high-resolution operation, the mirror scans\n20\xc2\xb0 in elevation at a time. The center of the elevation\nscan can be shifted up or down. Successive Scans are\n0.04\' apart in azimuth.\nThe color mode uses three sensors fitted with red,\ngreen, and blue filters. The size of a picture element\n\nON THE SURFACE\n\nis increased to O.12O. At that resolution, a single focus\nposition is sufficient. The mirror scans 60\xc2\xb0 in elevation The signals from the three sensors are processed\non successive scans. Since the 00\' azimuth angle\n.4\nbetween scans is now only one-third of a pixel, a fullcolor picture is imaged.\nAn infrared spectral mode uses three sensors whose\npeak sensitivities are at wavelengths of 0.85,0.95, and\n0.98 pm. The field angles and scans in this mode are\nthe same as in the color mode. The wavelengths were\nchosen to permit identification of minerd groups.\nThe survey operational mode uses the eleventh sensor, which has panchromatic sensitiviy and a 0.12\'\nfield of view. Since the scans are 0.12O apart in azimuth, this mode provides a panoramic survey with\nrelative rapidity.\nThe sensitivity of the twelfth diode, which has a\nred filter, is further reduced electronically so that it can\nimage the Sun. The camera makes astronomical observations in the single-line-scan mode, so that the imagery provides a record of the altitude and time at\nwhich the celestial body crossed the projected scan\n\n37\n\nline. The Sun sensor is employed only for solar observations; other bodies are observed by a panchromatic\nsensor.\nThe camera electronics digitize each pixel as a sixbit word. The camera has two scanning rates: 250 and\n16000 bits per second. The slow rate is compatible\nwith the direct communication link from the Lander\nto Earth. This permits real-time imaging during periods when the Lander is transmitting directly. The\nfast rate is the same as the rate of data transmission\nto the Orbiter, so that real-time imaging is also possible in the relay mode. Much of the time, though, the\ncameras operate at the fast rate and feed the imaging\ndata into the Lander\'s tape recorder.\nThe cameras can scan at either bit rate in all operational modes. At 250 bits per second, it d e s 5% min\nto scan one azimuth degree in the high-resolution and\ncolor modes, or a third of that time in the m e y\nmode. At 16000 bps the times are reduced to 5.28\nand 1.75 sec,respectively. Thus, a complete panorama\ncan be scanned in the survey mode in just 10 min at\nthe fast rate.\n\nl 3 a d b . g and Sampling the Surface\nThe Lander\xe2\x80\x99s chemical and biological investigations\nwith samples of the Martian surface material.\nThe primary function of the surface sampler is to dig\nselected samples out of the surface and deliver them to\nthe instruments that will analyze them. In addition, as\nexperience with the Surveyor landers showed on the\nMoon a decade ago, much mformation is gained about\nthe surface materials by just digging and analyzing\nthe results. For the Viking mission, these activities are\nformalized as part of the physical properties and magnetic properties investigations.\nThe surface sampler consists of a collector head on\nthe end of a retractable boom. The arm that houses\nthe boom is attached to the Lander body (seefig. 4-1)\nwhere it can be swung both horizontally and vertically.\nThe boom is ingeniously constructed with two ribbons\nof stainless steel, welded together along the edges.\nWhen it is extended, the two layers separate at the\ncenter to form a rigid tubelike structure. The boom\nis 3 m long when fully extended. When retracted, the\nboom flattens as the layers are squeezed rogether. The\nretracted portion is rolled up inside the arm housing.\nA flat cable sandwiched between the stainless steel\nlayers brings electrical power to the collector head\nmechanisms.\nThe collector head (fig. 5-1) is basically a scoop\nwith a movable lid, and a backhoe hinged to its lower\nsurface. Where the scoop is attached to the end of the\nboom, a rotation motor functions as a mechanical\nwrist. To iill the scoop, the lid is first raised and the\nboom is extended along or into the surface. During the\nfilling the backhoe lies flat, pointing backward. The lid\nis then closed to cover the sample. The top of the lid\nforms a sieve with 2 mm holes. When the collector\nhead is positioned over an instrument inlet, it is then\ninverted and the lid vibrated. Only partides that are\nsmaller than 2 mm are delivered to the instrument inlets. If a coarser sample is desired for the inorganic\n\nSolenoid\nactuatorhibrator\n\nall work\n\nSurface contact switch\nrotation position switch\nsieve\n\n180\xe2\x80\x9d head\n\nI:-*..---,\n\n{ &,\xe2\x80\x99;;;;;;hj\n\nrotation\nTemperature\nsensor (external 1\n\nFIGURE 5-I.-%\n\nMagnetic\narray\n\n\\\n\n-.-\n\n-\xe2\x80\x9d.\nr.\n\nswitch\nBackhoe\n\nmain features of the collector head.\n\nchemistry investigation, the screening can be performed before delivery. The other two instruments\nhave their own inlet filters.\nThe surface sampler can also dig trenches. With the\nbackhoe in the position shown in the drawing, the colIector head is lowered to the surface, and the trench\nis dug by retracting the boom. The excavated material\ncan be scooped up for a sample, if desired. If the\nLander should happen to land on a hard surface, the\nbrush on the front of the backhoe could be used to\nsweep the overlying dust into a pile that could be\nscooped up.\nThe temperature sensor on the bottom of the collector head is a source of both engineering and physical\nproperties data. The motors that operate the surface\nsampler are instrumented to provide readings of the\n39\n\n40\n\nVIKING\n\n1\n\nmotor current required to scoop, excavate, lift, and\ntransport the surface materials. This is another source\nof data for the physical properties investigation.\nBefore sterilization the collector head was chemically\ncleaned (to prevent sample contamination), and then\nenclosed in a protective shroud and pressurized with\nsterile inert gas.\nOperational difficulties were experienced with the\nsurface sampler on two occasions. Special procedures\nhad already been developed to handle such problems.\nThe intense teamwork that solved these difficulties\nincluded the use of images from the Lander cameras\non Mars, and a full-scale Lander in the Science Test\nLaboratory at Mission Control. The first problem was\nthe failure of the boom latch pin to drop because of\ninsufficient extension of the boom during the initial\nsequence. When the boom was then retracted, the\nlatch pin prevented the completion of the sequence.\nThe solution was to extend the boom beyond the initial\nposition. After it was extended further, a photograph\nverified t h a t the sampler was a t its correct extension\nand that the pin had been released (fig. 5-2 ) . The pin\n\nFIGURE\n5-3.-Lying\n\non the ground (arrow) is the troublesome pin.\n\nitself was later seen in another photograph (fig. 5-31\nwhere i t had impicted the surface.\nOn the Lander\'s eighth Martian day, the surface\nsampler dug into the surface and delivered samples to\nthe biology, molecular analysis, and inorganic chemistry experiments. Figure 5 4 shows the trench created\nin the fine, granular surface by the sampling operation.\nThe second difficulty was experienced when the\nboom failed to retract after acquiring a second sample,\nand the cameras were again used to obtain information\nnbout the extension of the boom. Knowing the boom\nposition facilitated the design of a sequence of motions\nthat permitted the resumption of sampling operations.\nPhysical Properties Investigation\n\nFIGURE 5-2.-The\n\nsampler at its correct extension.\n\nThe purpose of the physical properries investigation\nis to determine the chmcteristics of the Martian soil\nusing the Lander imaging system, the surface sampler,\nand the engineering sensors data. These data were aug-\n\nHANDLING AND SAhfPLING THE SURFACE\n\nFIGURE 54.-Trench created by the first sampling. (Cover\nphoto shows this area just before sampling.)\n\nmented by performing some simple experiments using\nthe materials at hand. Some special instruments were\nused such as strategically placed mirrors, stroke gages,\nand some markings on top of the Lander deck.\nThe first picture taken after landing included a footpad and its interaction with the surface. Later, pictures\nimaged the stroke gages showing the amount each\nlanding leg was compressed during landing.\nBefore the surface sampler was put into use, the\nshroud protecting the collector head was ejected downward. The camera then imaged the shroud\xe2\x80\x99s impact\narea and the previously photographed footpad (fig.\n5-5 ) . Analysis of these pictures indicates that material\nwas dislodged by the impact. Another impact study\nwas performed when a boom latch pin was dropped\nonto the surface and imaged.\nAll the time that the surface sampler was acquiring\nsamples for the analytical instruments, the record of\n\nRichard W. Shorthill\nRobert E. Hutton\n\nHenry J. Moore 11\nRonald F. Scott\n\n41\n\nits motor currents and the images of the sample sites\nwere providing data on the physical properties of the\nmaterial.\nThe Lander cameras periodically image three grid\npatterns on the top of the Lander body to record any\naccumulation of wind-deposited material or material\ndropped during sample delivery. The cameras likewise\nimage the impressions made by the material that was\ndumped from the surface sampler after sample delivery. Whenever a camera images one of the camera\ntest charts on top of the Lander, it provides information on the ultraviolet dosage that the surface is subjected to, by recording the darkening of two degradable coating squares on the reference test charts.\n.%me of the experimental activities planned for the\nlater stages of the surface mission are digging controlled trenches, dumping a scoopful of material on\none of the grids, picking u p a small rock and dropping\nit on the surface, and dropping loose material when\nthe meteorology instruments show that a steady wind\nis blowing. A 4X mirror mounted near the middle\nreference test chart is used to observe the Martian\nsurface material. The material is transported to the\n4 X mirror on the front porch (secondary sample retention area). (See fig. 4-1.) In addition, two other\nmirrors are used, one on either side of the surface\nsampler boom housing. Surface erosion caused by\nlanding engines is observed with one. A temperature\nsensor (used by the Entry Team) attached to the inside\nof a footpad is observed with the other mirror to verify\nits contact with the surface. Certain locations that cannot be seen directly, in front of the Lander, under the\nLander, and on :he Lander body, can be imaged by\nthese mirrors, if required.\n\nSome Early Results\nThe physical properties investigation found the surface material at the landing site to be slightly stiffer\nthan the \xe2\x80\x9clunar nominal\xe2\x80\x9d soil model that had been\nused during the designing and for the testing of the\nlanding gear system. The Viking 1 Lander landed with\na vertical velocity of 2.5 m/sec and a lateral component less than 0.5 m/sec. The stroke gages showed that\nthe crushable struts of leg 1 compressed 5.7 cm. The\nfootpad penetration is unknown because the cameras\ncannot see that location. Leg 3 stroked 8.3 cm, and its\nfootpad penetrated 3.6 cm,as measured from shadows\non the first surface photograph (see fig. 4-2 ) , Leg 2\nonly stroked 3.2 cm, and its footpad is completely\nburied in the surface material (fig. 5 - 6 ) .

The mobilization of iron and its\nconcentration in the core is a key episode in the\nEarths history. It is important to learn as much as\npossible about the Occurrence of iron on Mars. The\nextent of oxidation and hydration of the magnetic\nminerals also gives insight into the past composition\nof the planet\'s atmosphere.\n\n44\n\nVIKING\n\nThe means for detecting magnetic particles in the\nsurface materials are quite simple. There are two pairs\nof permanent magnets on the surface sampler\xe2\x80\x99s backhoe. Each pair consists of a ring magnet, about 25 mm\nin diameter, with a magnetic disk of opposite polarity\nin the center. The pairs are mounted at different\ndepths from the surface of the backhoe. There are thus\nlocal differences in the strength of the magnetic field.\nIn collecting samples, the collector head brings the\n\nFIGURE>-7.-Dark\n\n1\nbackhoe into intimate contact with the surface material. The particles adhering to the back surface of the\nbackhoe are imaged directly by the cameras, and the\nfront of the backhoe can be brought before a magnifying mirror on top of the Lander. Imaging in high\nresohtion and color is possible in both cases. The\nmagnets can be cleaned between samplings by oscillating the collector head.\nThere is another magnet pair on one of the\n\nbull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye pattern atop the camera calibration chart indicates the presence of\nmagnetic particles in wind-blown dust.\n\nHANDLING AND SAMPLING THE SURFACE\n\ncamera test charts on top of the Lander. Each\n\ntime a\n\ncamera images the chart for the purpose of calibration, it records the presence of any magnetic particles\nin the wind-blown dust.\n\nAn Early Result\nThe magnet pair at the top of a camera reference\nchm has captured windborne magnetic particles during its first two weeks on h k s . In figure 5-7, which\nis enlarged from a Lander image of the chart, the adhering particles render the magnetic field of the tiny\nmagnet pair as a dark bull\'s-eye pattern. The optical\n\n45\n\ncharacteristics of the atmosphere at the Lander site\nindicate that partides about one micrometer in size\nare held in suspension. Additional particles may have\nbeen tossed into the atmosphere by the landing or the\nsampling operations. Particles in that size range can\nadhere to the magnet, in the absence of strong winds,\neven if they are only very weakly magnetic, as for example hematite and goethite. Large particles of those\nminerals will not adhere, whereas magnetite and iron\np r i e of a much greater s k will. Some of the suratds\nface material from the first sampling site was held on\nthe backhoe magnets.\n\nThe Lander Environment\nThe three investigations considered in this chapter\ndeal with very diverse aspects of the environment into\nwhich the Lander has plunged. The meteorology investigation concerns itself with the lowest layer of the\natmosphere and with its variations with the time of\nday and from day to day. The seismology investigation\nis concerned with the stability of the ground beneath\nthe Lander and with the information that occasional\nground vibrations might supply about the structure of\nthe solid planet. (Unfortunately, it has not been possible to operate the Viking 1 seismometer b u s e of\nfailure to release the sensing coils from the a g e d\ncondition that protected them in flight.)\nThe radio science investigations use tracking data\nand variations in received signal properties to determine the coordinates of the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s position, local\nsurface electrical parameters, atmospheric and ionospheric profiles, local and global gravitational field\nproperties, and a number of other Mars and solar system environmental phenomena.\n\nMETEOROLOGYINVESTIGATION TEAM\nSeymour L.

The data for the\nthird full Martian day that are presented here (fig.\n6 2 ) can be considered typical of the daily weather so\nfar. The upper plot shows the air temperature and\npressure. The plot starts at midnight, local Lander time,\nand goes to the following midnight. The minimum\ntemperature, which comes just after dawn, was - 8 5 O\nC ( 188 K ) on that day. There is a gap in the data at\nthe time of maximum temperature because of the daily\nrelay transmission session, but the shape of the curve\nindicates a maximum temperature of about - 2 9 O C\n(244 K ) around 3 : 30 in the afternoon. The pressure\nshows a daily variation of about 0.2 mb between extremes.\nThe lower plot shows wind direction and velocity.\nDirections are shown in degrees dockwise from north;\nthus, a wind from the east is shown at No, a west\nand\nwind a t 270\xe2\x80\x99. No values are shown below SOo or\nabove 280\xe2\x80\x99 because so far no northerly winds at all\nhave been observed. Wind velocities are shown in\nmeters per second. The typical pattern has light easterly winds in the late afternoon, shifting to south by\nmidnight with wind velocity diminishing. During the\n\nMeteorology Investigation\nBy making direct measurements of the atmosphere\xe2\x80\x99s\ntemperature and pressure and the direction and speed\nof the winds over an extended time period, the Lander\nprovides scientists with their first direct opportunity\nto learn how another planet\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere works. The\natmosphere of M a r s is a p i c u l a r l y interesting one\nfor comparison with Earth\xe2\x80\x99s because some of the circumstances are so similar (for example, the rotation\nrate, and the inclination of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s a x i s to the\norbital plane that causes seasonal variations), while\nthe differences (such as the absence of oceans and the\nscarcity of water vapor) should make the Martian\ncase simpler to deal with theoretically.\nKnowledge of the weather that prevails at a given\ntime is necessary for some Lander activities, such as\n47\n\nFIGURE 6-1 .-The\n\nLander meteorological instruments atop their boom.\n\n49\n\nTHE LANDER ENVIRONMENT\n2801\n\n240\nY\n\n:f\n\ni\na\n\n210\n\n- 7.8\n\n220 --*-\n\ni\nf\n\n- 8.0\n\n4\n.\n\n+\n\n200-\n\n- 7.2\n\nT\n\n\'\n\n"\n\n\'\n\n"\n\n"\n\n"\n\nY\n\nj\n-\n\n- 7.6 f\n- 7.4 f\n3\n\n-\n\n"\n\nd\na\n*\n\nE\ng\n\nf\n\nI-\n\n?\n!\na\n\nim\n\nOh\n\n4h\n\n8h\n\n12h\n\n16h\n\n20h\n\n24h\n\nLander local time\n\nf\n\nFIGURE 6-3.-Air\n\na\n\ntemperatures on Mars measured by\nOrbirer and by Lander.\n\n7\n\n-0\n\na\n\n6\n\n5\n\ni\nz\n\n5\n\n.-\n\nN\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n1\nl80\nOh\n\nm\n4h\n8h\n\nL\n12h 16h\n\n20h\n\n24h\n\n0\n\nLander local time\nI\n\nGround temperature (Orbiter data)\nGround temperature (model)\nAir temperature (1.6 m above ground)\n\nFIGUREG2.-Weather\n\ndata for the third full day on Mars.\n\nnight the wind blows from the southwest, often with\noscillations in direction and speed. Wind speed increases and becomes gusty during the day, with variable direction. Maximum wind speeds per observation\nperiod are below 9 m/sec, with gusts up to about 15\nm/sec.\nThe air temperatures are measured at a height of\n1.6 m, which is about face height for the average person. The infrared thermal mapper (IRTM)on the\nViking Orbiter measures the temperature of the\nground. During the night, the ground and air temperatures should agree. Figure 6 3 shows that the night and\nearly morning ground temperatures measured from\norbit (dots) do indeed coincide with the observed air\ntemperatures (pluses). As the Sun gets higher, it\nshould heat the ground as shown by the solid curve,\nwhich is theoretical b e c a w the IRTM has not ob-\n\nserved the landing site between 8 in the morning and\nabout 4 in the afternoon. Assuming that real ground\ntemperatures follow the curve fairly we4 there is about\na 25\' difference at noon between the air and ground\ntemperatures. The effect of this expected temperature\ndifference is to stir up strong convection, just as it does\nin the Earth\'s desert regions. As the observations indicate, the convection is characterized by gusts that fluctuate rapidly in direction.\nDuring the first three weeks of weather observation, tinere has been a day-ro-day d&e, ~ i the zveri\nage, in the atmospheric pressure. The average rate of\ndecline has been 0.012 mb per Martian day. Such a\ndecline in readings could conceivably be the result of\na slow leak in the pressure sensor, but this is considered unlikely. The more probable explanation is the\nremoval of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by\ncondensation onto the south polar ice cap. At this\nseason, the north polar cap is at its minimum extent,\nwhile the southern cap is actively growing. With C02\ncomposing about 95 percent of the atmosphere, the\nplanet evidently undergoes a large seasonal loss of\natmospheric mass. Calculations based on the observed\nrate o pressure loss, the area of the south polar ice\nf\ncap, and the latent heat of sublimation being dissipated by radiation to space, produce an average temperature over the ice cap that is in general agreement\nwith the unexpectedly low temperatures measured\nthere by the infrared thermal mapper that are discussed in chapter 2.\n\n50\n\nVIKING 1\n\nMeteorology Instruments\nMost of the meteorology sensors are located at the\nend of the meteorology boom (fig. 6-1). The boom,\ndeployed right after the landing, is immovable thereafter. It serves to keep the sensors at a distance from\nthe Lander\xe2\x80\x99s heat sources and from protuberances that\nmight distort the wind flow.\nThe ambient temperature is measured by a set of\nthree fine-wire thermocouples. Because of their thinness, they can respond quickly to temperature fluctuations, but are subject to breakage; hence the use of\nthree thermocouples, operating independently. The remaining sensors on the meteorology boom are exposed\nto the wind. They measure the wind\xe2\x80\x99s speed, direction,\nand temperature. The basic wind sensor is a hot-film\nanemometer. This is a thin thermocouple probe, coated\nwith a platinum layer, and overcoated with aluminum\noxide for protection against abrasion by wind-borne\ndust. An electric current in the platinum layer heats\nthe probe, while the wind takes away the heat. The\nwind speed perpendicular to the probe is measured\nby the electric power needed to keep the probe at a\nfixed temperature above the surrounding air.\nThe Viking Lander anemometer has two heated\nprobes oriented 90 degrees apart, with an unheated\nprobe between them to measure the reference temperature. Automatic circuitry that compares the three\ntemperatures gives the total wind speed. It also provides a sensitive but ambiguous indication of wind\ndirection, because the sensors give the same readings\nfor winds in opposite directions. To resolve the ambiguity, the meteorology boom has the equivalent of\na wet finger held up to the wind. It is a quadrant\nsensor, a heated core surrounded by four thermocouples 90 degrees apart. The relative temperatures\nof the thermocouples determine the quadrant from\nwhich the wind is blowing.\nThe temperature sensor mounted on the bottom of\nthe surface sampler\xe2\x80\x99s collector head (fig. 5-1) is a\nparticularly useful supplement because it can be\nmoved about. An experiment is planned to measure\nnear-surface vertical temperature profiles by collecting temperature measurements at various elevations\nof the soil sampler boom.\nThe instrument that measures atmospheric pressure is located on the bottom of the Lander, and was\nused to measure the vertical pressure profile during\nthe parachilte phase of the descent. Its design adapts\nthe principle of the aneroid barometer to the low\n\nSEISMOLOGY\nINVESTIGATION\nTEAM\nDon L. Anderson\nFred Duennebier\nRobert L. Kovach\n\nGary V. Latham\nGeorge Sutton\nNafi M. Toksoz\n\npressure of the Martian atmosphere. The sensor is\nshielded from the wind.\nMeteorology readings are obtained during about\ntwenty periods per day. Each period includes several\ninstantaneous measurements to provide an indication\nof rapid fluctuations in the measured values.\nSeismology Investigation\nOne of the basic questions to be answered concerning any solid planet is the level of internally generated\nmovement, or tectonic activity. The Earth, which was\ndifferentiated early in its history into core, mantle, and\ncrust, is a tectonically active planet. Its crust comprises\na number of large plates that are in motion relative to\neach other, giving rise to most of the earthquakes\nthat we experience. The surface of Mars, as revealed\nin Mariner 9 photography, provides evidence of considerable tectonic activity in the past. The failure of\nthe Viking 1 seismometer to uncage its three sensing\ncoils makes the seismology investigation dependent on\nViking 2 for any data about the present level of seismic activity on Mars.\nEach Lander has a set of three miniaturized seismometers arranged in a mutually perpendicular manner. This three-axis seismometer is housed in a cubical\npackage on top of the Lander. Any ground motion is\ntransmitted through. the Lander\xe2\x80\x99s legs to the body and\nto the seismometer package. Low-frequency vibrations\nthat originate within the Lander are also sensed. In\norder to distinguish these, the scientists have a record\nof the motors that are operating aboard the Lander\nand the wind conditions.\nWith a three-axis seismometer, it is possible to\nlocate a seismic event approximately, and thus to\nidentify regions of tectonic activity. Analysis of the\nseismic data will indicate the wave-transmission characteristics of the material beneath the surface at the\nLander site, and should tell something about its physical state and even its composition.\nRadio Science Investigations\nRadio science investigations deal with tracking data\n(very precise measurements of distance and line-of-\n\nTHE LANDER ENVIRONMENT\n~~\n\nRADIO SCIENCE\nINVESTIGATIONTEAM\n\nWilliam H.

The conjunction\n\n51\n\nwill provide an opportunity for a test of general relativity theory by measuring the effect of the Sun\'s intense gravitational field on the signal\'s travel time.\nIt is characteristic of radio science investigations\nthat it takes a long time to get the answers. Some\nobservations must be taken over long intervals to\nyield significant results. From analysis of the first few\ndays of tracking data from the Viking 1 Lander, however, it has been possible to satisfy some of the radio\nscience objectives-determination of the Lander position and the orientation of the spin axis of Mars.\nIt has been determined that the aerocentric coordinates of the Lander are 22.27\' N latitude, 48.00\xc2\xb0 W\nlongitude, and 3389.5 km from the center of Mars.\nThe spin axis orientation, referred to the Earth\'s mean\nequator and equinox of 1950.0,is 317.35\' right ascension and 52.71\' declination. The location results indicate that Viking 1 landed about 28 km from its targeted landing site, well within the expected landing\ndispersions. The radius to the center of Mars is within\n1 km of some previous, less direct measurements, and\nprovides a reference point for other Viking measurements involving topographic parameters.\nThe results for the spin axis orientation represent a\nstatistically significant improvement over previous results. Since long arcs of Lander tracking data provide\nan excellent data source for these determinations, additional data will improve these estimates and could\nprovide information on pole motion.\n\n7\nComposition o the Surface\nf\nThe inorganic chemisay and molecular analysis investigations undertake a rather wide range of chemical analyses with their two miniaturized instruments.\nThe two investigations supplement each other in several important ways. When they analyze samples of\nthe same material, they yield basically diflerent kinds\nof information.\nThe inorganic chemistry investigation determines\nthe total abundance of each chemical element in a\nsample that may be a mixture of compounds, whereas\nthe molecular analysis investigation seeks to identify\nindividual compounds. Gaps in each analysis due to\nthe limitations of the method are iilled to a considerable extent by the results of the other analysis.\nTaken together, t e have provided important data\nhy\non the degree and nature of differentiation of the\nplanet\xe2\x80\x99s original components.

Determination of the\nlighter elements depends on combining indirect methods with data from the molecular analysis investigation on molecules that contain them.\nThe iirst result achieved by the inorganic chemistry\ninvestigation was a preliminary measurement of the\nargon content of the atmosphere at the Viking 1 landing site. Argon was determined to be no more than\n2 percent, by volume, of the atmosphere. This result,\nwhich confirmed that of the upper atmosphere mass\nspectrometer, was operationally important in that it\nhelped to clear the way for the use of the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer for atmospheric analysis.\nWhen the XRFS was supplied with a sample of the\nsurface material (fig. 7-l), the first return of data\nwas sufficient to detect the presence of the elements\niron, calcium, silicon, titanium, and aluminum as major\nconstituents.

(In general,\norganic molecules are those that include chains of\ncarbon atoms.) Knowledge of organic matter in.the\nsurface materials bears on the question of Martian\nlife in several ways. The living matter of a l terrestrial\nl\norganisms is composed of organic molecules. when\norganisms die, wme of the organic molecules are\nbroken down into inorganic gases and salts, and some\nare converted into other organic molecules. Organic\nmolecules can also be produced by nonbiological\nprocesses. Finally, the food of al heterotrophic (nonl\nphotosynthesizing) organisms is composed of organic\nmolecules. Thus, all organic molecules identified on\nMars are of great scientific interest.\nThe instrument designed for this investigation can\nalso determine the concentrations of the various organic and inorganic gases in the atmosphere. In this\nmode it uses the mass spectrometer in two a m e n t\nways: it can analyze the atmosphere by bleeding it\ndirectly into the instrument through a tiny leak, or it\nfirst removes the carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide,\n~hich\nrepresents the bulk of the atmosphere. In the\nlatter mode, the minor constituents can be detected\nwith higher accuracy and at lower levels.\nA series oi atmospheric analyses was performed during the fourth and fifth days after the Viking 1 landing. The results are summarized in table 7-2.\nAside from the confirmation of the presence of\nnitrogen, the most interesting result was the determination of the ratio of argon-36 to argon-40. T i is\nhs\nlower than the ratio in the Earths atmosphere by a\nfactor of ten. The noble gases provide a useful measure\nof the degree of outgassing a planet has undergone\nbecause they cannot be cycled in and out of the atmosphere by chemical combination. The isotope =Ar is\npart of a planet\'s primordial composition, while the\nabundance of the more common isotope \'OAr increases\nwith time due to the radioactive decay of potassium40. One possible theoretical consequence of the ratio\nthat was determined for Mars is that Mars has not\noutgassed to the extent that the Earth has, and that its\natmospheric pressure may never have exceeded 100\nmb.\n\nOxygen ( 0 2 )\n\nNitrogen ( N z )\nArgon ("Ar)\n36Ar/40Ar\nGas not detected\n\nNeon (Ne)\nKrypton (e)\nXenon (Xe)\n\nComposition\nApproximately 95 percent\n0.1-0.4 percent\n2-3 percent\n1-2 percent\n1:2750 2 500\nPreliminary detection limit\n\n10 PPm\n20 PPm\n50 PPm\n\nThe first sample was acquired for molecular analysis\non the same day (Sol 8) as the biology and inorganic\nanalysis samples. The molecular analysis was delayed\nfor some time because of the concern that made it\nuncertain that the sample had been delivered to the\ninstrument.\nThe analysis at 200\' C indicated that some carbon\ndioxide and very little water had been evolved. No\norganic molecules were detected.\nWhen the sample was heated to 500O C, copious\namounts of water were driven off, as well as some\nmore carbon dioxide. No complex organic molecules\n(with three or more carbon atoms) were detected,\ndown to the limit of about one part per million. A\nmore refined analysis of the data by elaborate computer\nprocessing is in progress to determine the presence, if\nany, oi other organic moiecuies beiow the one part per\nmillion level.\nThe water that appeared at 50O0 C was driven off\nfrom minerals that are rather stable hydrates. The paucity of water evolved at 200\' C indicates that very\nlittle water is adsorbed on the mineral grains, and that\nthe hydrated minerals do not decompose at that rather\nlow temperature.\nThe molecular analysis investigation employs a gas\nchromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS ) . Figure\n7-3 is a schematic diagram. The heart of the insuument is a mass spectrometer operating on the same\nprinciple as the upper atmosphere mas spectrometer\ndescribed in chapter 3: ionintion of the incoming\ngases, followed by the separation of their ionization\nproducts on the basis of mass-to-charge ratios.\nA mass spectrometer is particularly useful in dealing with a wide range of organic compounds because\nit provides specific information on the structure of a\n\n56\n\nVIKING\n\n1\n\nAtmosphere\ninlet\n\nSurface\nsample\n\nH vent\n,\n\nI\n\n-c\n\nt\n\nOven (one\nof three)\n\nHydrogen\nseparator\n\nMass\nspectrometer\n\nL\n\nPyrolyzer\n\ncolumn\noutput\nsignal\n\n1\nIntensity\n\nM\nMass number\n\nFIGURE7-3.--Schematic\n\nof the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer.\n\nmoleculethe arrangement of the carbon atoms and\nthe places of attachment of the functional groups of\natoms. Mass spectra can be interpreted even when the\nmolecules were previously unknown, and the molecular structure of an organic compound is often a good\nindicator of its origin.\nThis mass spectrometer can only measure ions whose\nmass-to-charge ratios are between 12 and 200 atomic\nmass units. At the low end this excludes hydrogen and\nhelium molecules. The instrument\'s range covers the\nmajority of simple organic molecules, including those\nformed by the thermal degradation of complex\nmolecules and organic atmospheric gases.\nA mass spectrometer can only work with gases or\nvaporized substances, and mass spectra are easiest to\ninterpret when the different vapors are introduced one\nat a time. The other components of the GCMS are\nthere to extract any organic material from the sample\nin vaporized form by the use of heat, and to separate\nthe delivery of the vapors to the mass spectrometer in\nthe time dimension by gas chromatography.\nLike the XRFS, the GCMS is located inside the\n\nLander body, with only the intake funnel extending\nabove it. After a surface sample is dropped into the\nfunnel, it is ground up before delivery to an oven. The\noven is rapidly heated to a temperature of 200\xc2\xb0 C\n(392" F ) , to release adsorbed atmospheric gases and\norganic compounds that are volatile at that temperature. The released gases are swept out of the oven and\ninto the gas chromatograph column by a stream of\ncarbon dioxide gas. The sweeping gas is labeled with\ncarton-13, so that it can be distinguished from Martian\nCOn by the mass spectrometer.\nThe gas chromatograph column is a coiled thin tube\nfilled with coated beads. The vapors entering the column are separated from each other by their different\ndegrees of retention on the beads. Slow heating of the\ncolumn progressively releases the various vapors to a\nstream of hydrogen that sweeps them out. The vaporladen stream passes through a palladium tube where\nthe hydrogen diffuses away, because palladium is permeable only to hydrogen, the smallest of all molecules. The vapors then enter the mass spectrometer.\nThe mass spectrometer produces a complete mass\n\nCOMPOSITION O F THE SURFACE\n\nspectrum every 1 seconds for the entire 84 minutes\n0\n\nof the gas chromatograph qcle. Thus, each mass spectrum represents a very s m a l I group of gases.\nThe sample in the oven is then heated again to\n50O0 C. This very high temperature volatilizes some\nof the remaining organic molecules, and decomposes\nothers into smaller, more volatile molecules. The thermal daomposition of complex molecules is called\n\n57\n\npyrolysis. The vapors released by the second heating\nof the sample are delivered to the mass s e t o e e\npcrmtr\nas before. An intermediate temperature of 350\' C can\nalso be employed if the results of early analyses indicate the need. The scientists who analyze mass Spectra\nmust try to reconstruct the molecular structure of the\norganic molecules that were pyrolyzed from the mass\nspectra of their pyrolysis products.\n\n8\nThe Search for Life\nA Paradox\n\nactivity. The biology instrument\xe2\x80\x99s next cycle of activity\nis being planned to continue the investigation which\nhas already raised such interesting questions. The results obtained with each experiment are presented\nfollowing the description of the experiment.\nIt was understood from the beginning that compelling evidence would be required before positive results\nfrom any of the experiments could be regarded as a\nbiological response. The planned procedures for the\nthree experiments are designed to obtain part of this\nevidence. Information that the molecular analysis investigation may provide about organic chemicals in\nthe surface materials would be extremely important\nevidence. Other evidence will have to come from new\nlaboratory experiments on Earth.\n\nIt is a paradox that the Viking biological investigations team had to design their experiments for a mission that would acquire much of the information they\nneeded for their designs. Yet it would have been unthinkable to pass up the opportunity presented by the\nViking mission to make an attempt at detecting certain kinds of life processes.\nIt can be assumed that living organisms are reasonably well adapted to their environments, and that they\nare composed of chemicals that are available to them.\nIn any case, knowledge of the organic and inorganic\nchemicals found in the surface materials and the atmosphere, and of the physical state in which they occur,provides boundaries on the kinds of biochemical\nreactions that might be detected. In the absence of\nsuch prior knowledge, the Viking biologists had to\nmake some assumptions about the nature of Martian\nmetabolic activity. It is a virtue of the Viking biology\ninstrument that the three types of experiments it conducts are based on different assumptions about the\nrequirements of hypothetical Martian microorganisms.\nIt was considered possible that nothing of significance would happen in any of the experiments. The\nfailure to detect a reaction would not necessarily indicate the absence of life on Mars; the assumptions\nabout the nature of the life processes might all be incorrect, or the particular landing site might be barren.\nAs it turned out, the results have been at once surprising, puzzling, and scientifically stimulating. In\neach of the experiments, the sample of Martian soil\nhas reacted in some fashion. At the time this is written, the meaning of the results in terms of the overall\nquestion is not clear. There have been chemical reactions; it remains to be determined whether any of the\nreactions is associated with biological or chemical\n\nBiology Instrument\nThe three biology experiments all involve the incubation of portions of the same sample under controlled conditions. The biology instrument (fig. 8-1 )\nhouses all of them, distributing measured amounts of\nthe sample to each,carrying out the complex sequence\nof operations and supplying the consumable substances that each requires, maintaining the incubation\nconditions, and finally collecting all the data for transmission to Earth.\nThe instrimem carries out all three experiments\nsimultaneously. The first biology analysis cycle, which\nstarted on the eighth day after the Viking 1 landing,\nhas been completed as of this writing. The mission\n\nHarold P. Klein\nNorman H.

However, the timing is flexible\nand, within limits, the incubation periods each experiment requires can be altered as the mission proceeds.\nAfter the first cycle, the individual experiments can\nalso be supplied with material from different surface\nsamples.\nThe three experiments are the pyrolytic release experiment, which looks for the biological synthesis of\norganic molecules from labeled gases; the labeled release experiment, which looks for the assimilation of\nlabeled nutrients with the release of gases; and the\ngas exchange experiment, which looks for metabol-\n\nically caused changes in the composition of the gases\nin contact with living organisms. A description of\neach experiment follows.\n\nPyrolytic Release Experiment\nThis experiment assumes that Martian life is based\non molecules containing carbon, and that the carbon\nis cycled through the atmosphere. On Earth, the photosynthesis of organic compounds from carbon dioxide\nand water by green plants is the most important process that fixes atmospheric carbon in living matter.\nAlgae and bacteria assimilate atmospheric carbon by a\ndifferent photosynthetic process. In addition, plant and\n\n6\n1\n\nTHE SEARCH FOR LIFE\n\nanimal cells alike accomplish some assimilation of carbon dioxide in the absence of light. A number of terrestrial bacteria can also assimilate carbon monoxide.\nThe emphasis in this experiment is on departing as\nlittle as possible from Martian conditions.\nThe experimental procedure is to incubate the soil\nsample for five days in a chamber (fig. 8-2) under\nMartian conditions, except that carbon dioxide and\ncarbon monoxide labeled with the radioactive isotope\ncarbon-14 replace a part of the natural atmospheric\ngases. The chamber is illuminated by miiicial sunlight to supply energy for photosynthesis.\nThe illumination dders from the sunlight that falls\non the Martian surface in only one respect: ultraviolet\nwavelengths shorter than 310 nm were filtered out\nbecause they are known to activate nonbiologicd\n\nsyntheses that would mimic positive results in the\nexperiment.\nAfter incubation, the test chamber is heated to\n625\xe2\x80\x99 C, to pyrolyze any organic material. A stream of\nhelium gas sweeps the vaporized pyrolysis products\nonto a chromatographic column commonly referred to\nas the organic vapor trap. Unreacted CO, and CO pass\nthrough the organic vapor trap into a radiation detector downstream. The carbon-14 contained in this \xe2\x80\x9cfirst\npeak\xe2\x80\x9d is counted to aid in interpretation of the test. If\nthe vaporized pyrolysis products contain organic\nmaterials, they are trapped on the organic vapor trap\nand are released during the elution phase. This involves heating the vapor trap to 700\xe2\x80\x99 C s as to como\nbust the trapped organic compounds to CO,.

Although photosynthesis would\nproduce a high second peak, the method is sensitive\nenough to detect the kind of nonphotosynthetic assimilation that all terrestrial cells accomplish.\nThe procedure described above was followed with\nthe surface sample in the Viking 1 biology instrument.\nThe radiation level measured in the first peak was\nabout 7400 counts per minute. The second peak was\nmeasured at 573 cpm. After sckacting 477 cpm,\nwhich is the background radiation level, the net level\nof the second peak is 96 cpm. This is a numerically\nsignificant peak, since the predicted level in the absence of any carbon assimilation was only 15 cpm.\nBefore ascribing the net second peak to biological\nactivity, it is necessary to eliminate any other possible\ncauses. The remaining procedures of the pyrolytic release experiment are designed to eliminate as many as\npossible. The first procedure that will be carried out\nis a control experiment. A second portion of the original soil sample will be heated in a clean chamber to a\ntemperature of 160" C for 3 hours. This is a regime\nthat effectively sterilizes terrestrial soils. Then the incubation, pyrolysis, and counting procedures will be\nperformed exactly as they were the first time. If the\nmeasured second peak is as high as it was on the\nunsterilized sample, that would eliminate biological\nactivity as the cause of the earlier results. If the steri1 ized sample produces a significantly lower second\npeak, the next step is to repeat the first test with another sample of soil freshly acquired from the Martian\nsurface.\nLabeled Release Experiment\nThis experiment assumes that the biochemical reactions of Martian microorganisms require water, that\nthe organisms assimilate some relatively simple organic molecules and ions, and that they release gases\ncontaining part of the carbon from the nutrients. The\nnutrients selected (formate and lactate, the amino\nacids glycine and alanine, and glycolic acid) are assimilated by many terrestrial microorganisms, and they\nmay be present on other planets as products of nonbiological synthesis. For this experiment they are all\nlabeled with carbon-14.\nThe soil sample is placed in an incubation cell (fig.\n8-2) with enclosed Martian atmosphere, and moistened with a small quantity of water containing the\ndissolved mixture of labeled nutrients. During the\nincubation period, the atmosphere above the sample\n\n1\nis continuously monitored by a set of radioactivity\ndetectors. If any microorganisms excrete any carbon\ngas, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or\nmethane as a result of assimilating the labeled nutrients, the radioactivity of the enclosed atmosphere will\nbuild up. A curve of cumulative radioactivity as a\nfunction of time might indicate the metabolic growth\nrate of .the organisms.\nAt the end of the incubation period, which is carried out in darkness, the test cell and detector chamber\nare purged of radioactive gases with helium. The experiment can then be repeated with new samples in\nfresh test cells. There are four test cells available, so\nthat if any sample indicates positive results a fresh\nportion of that sample can be heat-sterilized and then\nincubated as a control.\nThe results of this experiment were startling initially, and continue to present surprises. As soon as\nthe few drops of nutrient solution were injected into\nthe incubation chamber, the radioactivity rose steeply\nfrom the previous background level of 750 cpm.\nClearly, gases were being released that included the\nlabeled carbon from the nutrients. The rate of increase began to slacken within a day, and the radioactivity became almost level after a week at about\n10 000 cpm. Seven days after the first injection, a few\nmore drops of the nutrient solution were injected into\nthe incubation chamber. For a very brief time more\nlabeled gas was released, and then the total radioactive\ngas rapidly decreased by about 30 percent and subsequently rose very slowly.\nA possible nonbiological explanation for the initial\nburst of labeled gas emerges in the light of the finding\nby the gas exchange experiment that its sample released oxygen rapidly to the atmosphere in the presence of water vapor. If the soil particles are coated\nwith a strong oxidizing agent (possibly caused by\nultraviolet activation) they could not only release\noxygen from water vapor (if present) but they could\noxidize some of the laheled nutrients to release 14C02.\nThere is much laboratory work to be done on the\neffect of strong ultraviolet radiation on minerals. In\nthe incubation chamber, the release of CO, would level\noff with the depletion of either the oxidant or the\noxidizable component of the nutrient solution. Several\npossible reasons for the subsequent reduction in radioactivity are being investigated.\nThis experiment will now perform a control cycle\non a portion of the same soil\'that gave the initial\nresults. The soil will be heated to a temperature suf-\n\nTHE SEARCH FOR LIFE\n\nficient to kill terrestrial microorganisms. The test and\ncontrol responses will then be compared. In addition,\nan extended incubation of a new sample will be run\nthrough September and October. Meanwhile, the\nchemical oxidant theories will be tested in the laboratory to help interpret the results from Mars.\nG a s Exchange Experiment\n\nThis experiment, like the labeled release experiment, assumes that Martian biochemical reactions are\naqueous. It also assumes that metabolic activity involves some exchange of chemicals between the organisms and the atmosphere. Beyond that, it tests a pak\nof contrasting assumptions about the food requirements of the microorganisms in the soil sample. One\nis that the soil contains st@cient nutrients to sustain\nsome biological activity when a little water vapor is\nsupplied. The other is that there are microorganisms\nin the soil that require one or more of the common\nnutrients of terrestrial life for their growth.\nThe soil sample in this experiment is suspended in\na porous cup above the floor of the incubation chamber (fig. 8-2). The atmosphere surrounding it is\ncomposed of carbon dioxide, krypton (introduced as\na calibration standard), and enough helium to attain\nthe desired atmospheric pressure. A rich mixture of\ncommon nutrients in water solution is added to the\nbottom of the chamber. For the h s t seven days of incubation the liquid level is below the cup, so that only\nwater vapor is transferred to the soil sample. Then, if\nthere are no indications of metabolic activity, additional solution is introduced to bring the liquid level\nup to the sample, so that the soil imbibes the nutrients\nduring the remainder of the incubation period. The\nentire incubation takes place in darkness.\nSmall samples of the atmosphere in the chamber\nare drawn off periodically for gas analysis. A stream of\nhelium carries the gas sample through a long, coiled\nchromatograph column that detains individual gaseous\ncomponents for different lengths of time. The gases\nin a simple mixture can be identified by their arrival\nrimes at the thermal conductivity detectors. The sig-\n\n63\n\nnificant gases are krypton (as a standard ) , hydrogen,\nnitrogen, oxygen, methane, and carbon dioxide. Monitoring the concentrations of these gases at different\ntimes during the incubation should make it possible\nto distinguish those changes due to the release of\nadsorbed gases and nonbiological chemical reactions\nfrom those that result from metabolic activity.\nThis experiment uses a single test cell. After an\nincubation cycle, a fresh sample can be added on top\nof the old one, the nutrient-rich medium can be\npumped out and replaced by fresh medium, and the\natmosphere can be flushed out and replaced to start a\nnew incubation period. If a cycle shows evidence of\nbiological activity, the drained test cell can be heated\nto sterilize the sample before running a new incubation\nThe results to date of this experiment have also\nbeen surprising. When the nutrient solution was introduced to the bottom of the chamber (so that the\nsoil was not in contact with it), oxygen was rapidly\nreleased to the atmosphere. The amount was about\n15 times as much as could be accounted for from\nknown sources. The oxygen content soon leveled off.\nCarbon dioxide was also rapidly released, and then\nleveled off concurrent with the 0 .\n, The amount of\nCO, produced was consistent with desorption of CO,\nfrom soil surfaces. Then the nutrient level was raised\nsufficiently to wet the soil for the h t time. No addis\ntional oxygen was released. There has been a decrease\nin the CO, content after the wetting of the soil.\nA reasonable explanation of the initial release of\noxygen was mentioned in connection with the labeled\nrelease experiment. The Lander site is a desert, and the\nsurface may not have encountered high atmospheric\nhumidity in a very long time. The surface particles\nhave an iron oxide coating, and are exposed to solar\nultraviolet radiation that the Earth\'s surface does not\nreceive. The possibility of forming an oxidizing coating by a photocatalytic process has been studied some,\nbut there is much experimental work to do. The decrease in CO, after wetting is most readily explained\nby the presence of an alkaline core under the coating.\n\nAppendix A\n\nVIKING SQENCE TEAMS\n\nJames A.
