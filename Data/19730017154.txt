the great activity was due to extremely high shear\nand gradients in the magnetic field, as well as a constant\ninvasion of\n\none\n\npolarity into the opposite;\n\nobser-\n\nvations in 3835 show remarkable fast flashes in the impulsive\nflare of 18:38 on August 2 with lifetimes of 5 seconds, which\nmay be due to dumping of particles in the lower chromosphere;\nflare loops show evolutional increases of their tilts to the\nneutral line in the flares of August 4 and 7; spectroscopic\nobservations show red asymmetry and red shift of the Ha emission\nin the flash phase of the August 7 flare, as well as substantial\nvelocity shear in the photosphere during the flare, somewhat\nlike earthquake movement along a fault;\n\nfinally the total Ha\n\nemission of the August 7 flare could be measured accurately\nas about 2.5 x 1030 ergs, considerably less than coarser previous estimates for great flares.\nour data has appeared\n\nA preliminary report on\n\n(Tanaka and Zirin, 1973) and we present\n\nhere our comprehensive analysis of the wealth of material\nobtained.\n\n-6- a-\n\nII.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE REGION, JULY 10 TO 15\n\nMcMath 11957, the predecessor of McMath 11976,\n\nfirst\n\nappeared on Big Bear films on July 11, growing in a quiet\nregion.\n\nFigure 1 shows an Ha picture of development on\n\nJuly 12 and Figure 2, the magnetograms.\n\nContrary to popular\n\nbelief, such regions do not emerge from the elements of the\nnetwork but in perfectly quiet regions in between--note the\nblack dot\n\n(p polarity) in the 10 July magnetogram.\n\nThe mag-\n\nmetic polarity was inverted from the start, the arched filaments being rotated 1200\n\nfrom the normal E-W direction.\n\nIn\n\naddition to the first set of flux loops, other systems arose,\nso that on July 12 there were 2 sets of f spots, both connected\nBetween July 12 and July 13 there was\n\nto the same p area.\nrapid growth of the p\n\nspot, and the magnetogram for the 13th\n\nshows the strong field gradients thus produced.\nsmall\n\nA number of\n\nflares were observed in this region, and spectra were\n\nobtained of intense small surges at the limb on the 15th.\n\nThe\n\nlimb activity on the 15th was almost continuous, made up of\nmany small surges.\n\nIt is clear that the\n\nmagnetic\n\ncom-\n\nplexity of this region was inherent in its structure from its\nfirst emergence from below and was not a consequence of interaction with existing regions.\n\nMcMath 11947, the region just\n\nahead of it, died out on the back side and was not seen the\nnext time around.\n\nFigure 1\nEarly stage of McMath 11976 (as McMath 11957) at 18:17:23, July 12, Ha + 0.5 R.\nIt is in the lower\ncenter of the frame, a typical complex emerging flux region (EFR). The dark fibrils probably parallel new flux loops, and would normally run E-W in a simple region. Comparison with Figure 2 shows\nthat the sunspot in the upper part of the group is p (preceding, or S) polarity, and the regions below and surrounding are f (following, N).\nThe spots at left died out on the back side of the sun.\nS top, W left on all photos.\n\nBIRTH OF THE REVERSED\nPOLARITY REGION\nOF AUGUST, 1972\ns\nE\nJUL 10 16:45\n\nJUL II 01:01\n\nJUL 12 17:08\n\nJUL 13 16:26\n\nFigure 2\nA series of videomagnetograms of the birth of McMath 11957 made by James\nMosher.

In this series white is preceding (p)\npolarity, dark following; the intensity of light or dark shading is proportional to the longitudinal field strength. The growth of spot fl is\nclearly seen as intense dark polarity below, and the eastward spread of\np is seen as the rightward spread of white polarity. Very rarely do such\nstrong gradients appear.\n\nFigure 7\nAn enlarged frame 8/3, with various sunspots and areas marked to facilitate\nreference in the text. Note the strongly twisted penumbral structures.\n\n-8-\n\nway through the group.\nThe spot fl,\n\nin particular, which seems to have pro-\n\nduced most of the activity, was connected to P 2, whereas a\nmuch shorter, lower energy connection to the near part of p 3\nwas possible.\n\nThe large f plage pll, enclosed by the filament\n\nfiZ 1, which did not form completely till August 1, was\nsharply bounded on the left\n\n(west) by the filament, with\n\nhorizontal polarity only a few thousand km away.\n\nNote that\n\nthe neutral line was almost N-S on August 1 and became sharply\nkinked afterwards.\nThe spot fl was indeed remarkable, and more so as it grew.\nIt shows normal longitudinal spot polarity in the magnetogram,\nbut the overlying Ha fibrils show transverse field a few\nthousand km above, so the field makes a sharp turn.\n\nBecause\n\nthe spot grew so rapidly it must be half of an emerging flux\nregion\n\n(Zirin, 1971), but where is its sibling p polarity?\n\nThe sibling appears to be the\n\nspot P 2 .\n\nThis spot and\n\nfl are seen to be connected by dark fibrils which are bright\nand active at both ends.\n\nSeveral flares (such as Figure 4,\n\n8/3) are bright at both points.\n\nBut these fibrils, in contrast\n\nto the normal arched filament systems, are strongly twisted\nand not prominent in pictures off the center of Ha.\n\nThe\n\nspots separated as in normal emerging flux, but opposite the\nnormal direction--the p polarity moved east and the f polarity\nwest.\nA particular feature of this group was the sharp twisting\nof penumbral fibrils seen in white light pictures and in Ha\n\n-9-\n\noff-band pictures as well, to run parallel to the neutral\nline.\n\nSuch a twisting means that the sunspot field, which\n\nnormally falls off like 1/r2 , as the penumbral fibrils radiate\noutward, is confined to a narrow corridor of sheared fibrils,\nand the horizontal field in this corridor may reach spot\nvalues (i.e. 2000 gauss or more).\n\nThis feature of sheared\n\npenumbras is common in regions giving big flares\n\n(e.g. August\n\n28, 1966, Zirin and Lackner, 1969).\nOn August 1 there were continual bright flashes along\nthe neutral line, and by the end of the day, two areas at\nopposite ends of the neutral line, near P2 and fl, were growing steadily brighter.\n\nThe spot fl was completely covered\n\nby horizontal fibril structure.\n\nThese fibrils go south from\n\nfl, and, crossing above fl are fibrils going N from p3.\n\nSince\n\nthe fibrils must lie along the field lines, there were at\nleast two polarity reversals above fl, which of course must\nhave longitudinal polarity.\nare common before flares.\n\nFibril crossings of this type\n\n-10- g-\n\nIV.\n\nFLARES OF AUGUST 2\n\nMajor activity began in the region on August 2 with a\nremarkable series of complex flares.\n\nThe first great flare\n\nwas reported at 03:16 U.T. by Teheran;\nperhaps a resurgence\nradio burst)\nU.T.\n\nthe later phases or\n\n(two flares were reported but only one\n\nare visible on our Tel Aviv photograph of 05:47\n\n(Figure 8).\n\nThis shows a large\n\ncovering all the spots,\n\nflare with bright\n\nstrands\n\nthe brightest portion being over f2 .\n\nIt differed from the later flares in that the p emission\nwas confined to the spots and an area directly west.\nlong,\n\nThe\n\ndark filament following the group had disappeared, blown\n\naway by the flare.\n\nIt reformed in bits and pieces, was blown\n\naway again by the later flares, and was whole again on August 3.\nBy contrast, the great flares of August 4 and 7 only made it\nwave about.\n\nWhether or not the flare was associated with changes\n\nin the magnetic field structure, there were definite changes\non the 1st and 2nd;\nshrank,\n\nthe spot\n\nso that at August 2,\n\nother two\n\nfl grew, and the spots\n16:00,\n\nf2\n\nand f3\n\nfl was bigger than the\n\n(eventually fl became the largest spot in the group).\n\nSpot fl also pushed ahead\n\n(W) relative to the other spots,\n\ncan be readily seen from the illustration\n\nas\n\n(Figures 3 and 4);\n\nby August 2nd, the neutral line marked by the filament was\ndirectly beneath\n\n(N) of the p spots.\n\noccurred in the fibril\n\nA remarkable change also\n\nstructure preceding the spot f3 .\n\nthe 31st, this was directly above\n\n(S) of P1\n\nOn\n\nand very close to\n\nFigure 8\nFirst flare, August 2, photographed at Tel Aviv, dawn, by Shlomo Hoory in\nHa centerline.\nThis photo at 05:43:38, more than two hours after the\nflare began, shows that it was similar to the later great flare.\n\n-11- a-\n\nf3\' almost along the neutral line dividing P 1 and f3 ; on the\n2nd (after the first flare), the fibril on the neutral line\nhad moved considerably ahead\n\n(W) of f3 and a new fibril system\n\nconnected f3 to Pl, with f3 rapidly decaying.\n\nWe have noted\n\nbefore that a sheared neutral line can be replaced by shorter\nlines going directly across the neutral line to the nearest\nopposite polarity; this appears to occur in this case.\n\nThe\n\nflux in f3 can disappear by shortening and eventual subsidence\nbelow the surface of the flux loops.\n\nThe energy released in\n\nthis flare would presumably be the difference between the\nelongated sheared lines and the shorter field lines of the\nfinal configuration.\n\nThis difference was actually observed\n\nduring later flares; for example, in the flare 18:38, August 2,\na rapid break-up of the filament into shorter fibrils occurred\nat 18:37 U.T., one minute before the brightening started\n(Figure 9).\n\nFor the flares of August 4 and August 7, we could\n\nsee the bright flare loops cross the neutral line with increasing tilts, late in the flash phases\n\n(Figures 18 and 19).\n\nIf there is a further contraction involved in the subsidence\nof field lines below the surface, this energy too is available\nfor the flare.\nto P 1\n\nIn succeeding days f 3 moved considerably closer\n\nand thus lowered the total energy.\nOn August 2, Big Bear observations were made in Ha cen-\n\nterline and 3835 A. After a small flare along the neutral line\nat 16:01, a brilliant impulsive flare began at 18:38.\n\nIts\n\ndevelopment is shown in dark prints in Figure 9 and in normal\nprints in Figures lla and llb.\n\nThe flare occurred along the\n\nt 8:39:36\n\nFigure\n\n9\n\nA series of prints made to show varied aspects of the 18:38 flare (18:34)\nHa + 1 R, showing spot structure, with spots marked.

All flashes occur precisely at the edge of the\numbras, where the field lines turn and intersect the surface. These pictures are taken with a corrector designed by the late Professor I.S. Bowen\nto remove the aberration of the singlet lens; unfortunately it was not\nproperly adjusted and there is some astigmatism.\n\n-13-\n\nexample Figure 10\n\n(a),\n\n(b) and (c) at 18:39:44).\n\nbright strands(d) in Figure 10 mark\nably corresponds to the usual p and f\nare much closer.\n\nThe strands\n\nThe double\n\nthe Ha center, and presumpolarity strands, but\n\n(d) and point (b) rose with the\n\nfirst x-ray pulse, then broke up into faint points; a new\nbright point appeared at 18:39:24, as the flux rose.\n\nIt faded\n\nin 10 seconds, and a row of points flashed into view at the\nx-ray maximum, 18:39:34.\n\nThe points appeared in symmetric\n\npairs such as points(a)and(e);the lower points are less visible.\nAs time passed, more points appeared to the north edge of fl.\nBy 18:40:00, no more flashes were seen except for the lingering\nof point (f), which was under a long-lived Ha flare knot.\nWe interpret the 3835 flashes as occurring at the intersection of flux loops with the surface; the emission must be\ndue to the heating of the lower atmosphere by energetic electrons as they are accelerated in individual flux tubes and\ngive up their energy at the surface\'.\n\nThermal conduction from\n\nthe flare above as an alternative source of heating would not\nbe able to explain the fast time variation and limited extent\nof the flashes; the collision frequency at these densities\nis sufficient to produce conductivity across the field line\nwhich would rapidly homogenize the temperature in the source\nregion, making difficult selective and time-dependent heating\nof the lower atmosphere, as well as spreading the emission area.\nDetailed discussions of the 3835 flashes related to the x-ray\nand radio bursts will be given in the next chapter.\nThe activity of August 2 was not yet over; more flares\n\n-14--\n\nwere to come.\n\nI\nAlthough the filament fil\'\n\nit\n\nwas disrupted,\n\nreformed and straightened again; bright areas resulting from\nthe flare remained, particularly of the f edge of fiZ\n\n1.\n\nAt\n\n19:57 the area below spot fl brightened slowly, then more\nrapidly after 20:01\n\n(Figure 11c).\n\nA weak brightening in 3835\n\nappeared at the most intense portion of the HI flare.\n\nThis\n\nflare reached maximum around 20:05 and remained stable; it\nproduced a modest hard x-ray burst, but little radio emission;\nat 20:20 a new increase in area and brightness began on both\nsides of fil 1 and at 20:30 yet another wave of brightening\nspread south from fiZ\n(Figure 12)\n\nin 3835\n\n1;\n\nthis was matched by a bright region\n\n(twice the photospheric intensity)\n\nthe edge of the advancing bright Ha front.\nthe entire p side of fiZ\n\njust at\n\nAt the same time\n\n1 brightened as well.\n\nThe 3835\n\nemission in this flare was not impulsive at all, lasting more\nthan 15 minutes, although the lifetime at any point on the\nsurface was only a few minutes.\n\nAgain it appears to mark the\n\nfootpoints of flux loops containing the energetic material\n(this time thermal conduction can be the heat source).\n\nThe\n\nhard x-ray flux increased again and a large 6600 sfu, 8800 MHz\nburst occurred.\nat 20:50\n\nThe Ha front spread steadily on to a maximum\n\n(Figure lld); the 3835 emission moved south with a\n\nconstant velocity of 12 km/sec and changed its direction to\nnortheast when it hit the edge of penumbra fl as if it was\nreflected by the spot field.\n\nThe 3835 emission could be fol-\n\nlowed till 21:05, but by now the Ha emission near the filament\nwas dying out and the whole flare faded, accompanied by fine\n\nBIG BEAR SOLAR OBSERVATORY\nMULTIPLE\n\nFLARE\n\n8/2/72\n\nFigure 11\nAn He centerline sequence of the flares after 18:38.

the emission\nactually shifted to a different place, and was strong in offband\n\n(Figure lie),\n\n3835 emission.\n\nindicating broad Ha profile, and showed\n\nSo there was a real flare resurgence, parti-\n\ncularly over the main umbra.\n\nThe UCSD x-ray data shows a\n\nsmall resurgence of x-ray emission above 10 KeV but less than\nthe peak of 20:50.\n\nSo there were no more harder electrons,\n\njust a stronger magnetic field.\nThe varied aspects of the August 2 flares present an\nexcellent opportunity to compare different flares in the\nsame region.\n\nThe comparison between the impulsive 18:38\n\nflare--small, violent, short-lived--and\n\nthe large, long-\n\nlived, slowly-rising flares at 03:10 and 20:00 is most instructive.\n\nThe first was physically low in the atmosphere,\n\nconfined to the neutral line in a small region, and by far\nthe most brilliant and concentrated.\n\nIt also produced the\n\nshort-lived, intense hard x-ray burst with a spectrum proportional to v\n\n-3.5\n\n.\n\nnature very well.\n\nThe 3835 observations show the impulsive\nRadio emission was low below 2700 MHz,\n\nindicating a low source height\n\n(because of plasma cut-off or\n\nother high density absorption).The 03:10 and 20:00 flares were by\ncontrast complex and slow, with longer rise times both for Ha and\n\n-16-\n\nenergetic electrons, and radio emission appeared at low\nfrequencies, showing that the events reached high in the\natmosphere.\n\nSince radio flux and x-rays are proportional to\n\nthe total number of electrons, we can see how the large volume\ninvolved produced the huge radio bursts.\n\nHowever, these\n\nlarge events were less impulsive and had a steeper electron\nspectrum, so high frequency radio emission was less; for\nexample, at 35 GHz the 21:40 peak is only slightly higher than\nthe 18:39 peak, although it is 20 times higher at 8.8 GHz.\nWe may conclude that slow events may accelerate particles\nquite well, but that impulsive, low-lying flares produce the\nhardest spectra.\n\nFinally we have the peculiar effect of the\n\ngreatest radio burst occurring late in the event without an\naccompanying large change in the optical flare; apparently\nonce the hard electrons are produced, phenomena over the\ngreatest spots can produce great fluxes of radio emission\n(because the emission is proportional to B).\nHuancayo polarization data published by Lincoln and\nLeighton (1972)\n\nshow a sharp variation from left to right hand\n\ncircular polarization at 9400 MHz, then back to left, in the\n18:38 flare, whereas the 21:00 flare shows only right hand\npolarization.\n\nThis corresponds to the fact that the later\n\nflare occurred primarily in the following ( = N polarity = rhc\npolarization) part of the group (see Figure lie, how f area\nis large compared to p area), while the impulsive flare was\non the neutral line where changes in the polarity balance\ncould easily occur.\n\nThe August 7 flare was also found by\n\n-17-\n\nHuancayo to show such a L-R-L shift in the impulsive phase.\nIn both cases, the largest sunspot in the flare region was fl,\nso that following polarity would dominate the radio propagation.\n\n-18- a-\n\nV.\n\nTHE 3835 FLASHES AND IMPULSIVE BURSTS OF X-RAYS AND\nMICROWAVES\n\nThe 3835 flashes in the 18:38\n\nflare of August 2 occurred\n\nsimultaneous with the impulsive hard x-rays and radio bursts.\nSince good data were obtained in UCSD x-ray experiments and\nat Sagamore Hill for microwave bursts,\n\nit would be useful to\n\ncompare these three wavelengths for better understanding of\nelectron accelerations in the impulsive phase.\nFigure 13 shows comparison of the light curves of several\n3835 flashes with x-rays and radio bursts.\n\nEach light curve\n\nwas made by measuring the brightness of a 3 arc sec2 area which\nshowed several resolved and/or unresolved flashes in the whole\nlifetime\n\n(1 minute) of the flashes with a mean lifetime of an\n\nindividual flash less than 10 seconds.\nFigure 10 point\n\n(a),\n\nat least 5 points.)\noptical\n\nthe topmost at\n\n(For example, in\n\n18:39:44, is made up of\n\nOne can see that the intensity of the\n\nflashes peaked around the same time as the x-ray and\n\nradio bursts and that the light curves are more similar to\nthe x-ray bursts above 50 KeV than to the 14-20 KeV x-rays or\nradio bursts at 5000 MHz.\n\nIn addition, Figure 10 shows that\n\nthe first flashes appear at 18:39:04 simultaneous with the\nfirst x-ray spike, and the most flashes were seen at the peak\naround 18:39:40.\n\nThe x-ray spectrum was proportional to v 3-4\n\nat the peak and softening of the spectrum began from 18:40:10\n(Datlowe, private communication).\nThe observed intensity of the 3835 flashes can be explained\n\na\n\n3835A\n\n- 10\n\n- 3.5\n(QR)\n\n[\n\nb\n\nC\n\n- 1000 sfu\n4995 MHz\n\n- 5000\n\n14- 20 KEV\n\nm2 sec KEV )\n\n-50\n\nAug. 2\n\nI\n\n18:37\n\nI\n\n18:38\n\nI\n\nI\n\n18:39\n\n18:40\n\nI\n\n18:41\n\nI\n\n18:42\n\nI\n\n18:43\n\nFigure 13\nLight curves of the 3835 flashes measured at three positions (see Figure\n10 for identifications of positions).\nThe lower three curves show a microwave burst (Sagamore Hill) and two channels of hard x-rays (UCSD).\nNote\nthat the time histories of the 3835 flashes are most similar to the 64-94\nKeV burst.\n\n-19-\n\nby Balmer line (H9) emission centered at 3835 X.\n\nWhen we look\n\nat spectra taken in another large 2B flare, November 18, 1970,\nobserved by Tanaka (unpublished) at Okayama, we find wide and\nlarge emission of H9, which has 4 equivalent A of the mean\nintensity level of 3835 region (20% of the true continuum).\nWe require, in this intense flash, emission of H9 greater by\na factor of two than the above flare;

precipitation\nof low energy electrons below 20 KeV, which existed till late\nas Figure 11 shows, or thermal conduction produced continued\nheating of the upper layer emitting Ha.\nIt can be shown from the x-ray flux that electrons above\n45 KeV in the thin foil model and above 60 KeV in the thick\n\n-20-\n\nfoil model have the same total energy as the optical flux\nestimated above.\n\n50 KeV electrons can penetrate the column\n\ndensity n H - 1020\'4 as the theory of Coulomb collision shows\np\n(Schatzman, 1965; Shmeleva and Syrovatskii, 1972; Brown, 1972).\nAlso from the observed production rate of 50 KeV electrons in\nthe thick foil model ( = 1.0 x 10 35sec 1) it turns out that\nthese electrons penetrating the chromosphere can ionize\n2\n7 x 1020atoms/cm\n\n-sec by making an ion pair every 33 KeV\n\n(Fermi, 1949; Hudson, 1972).\n\nTherefore we can explain reason-\n\nably the heating and ionization of the layer responsible for\nthe 3835 flashes (nenpH - 4.2 x 10 33) by the dumping of the\n10 132cm\n\n3\n\nand H\n\n10\n\nelectrons above 50 KeV.\n\nWe have n\n\nfor the emitting layer.\n\n2cm\n\nSimilarity of time profiles between\n\n-\n\n-\n\nthe 3835 flashes and x-ray bursts above 50 KeV (Figure 13)\nwould support this explanation.\n\nBecause of confusion with\n\nthe other flares we do not know if there was any proton production involved in this fast event, but the fact that y-rays\nwere not detected gives an upper limit of proton flux less than\n3 x 1026ergs/sec, below the energy flux of the optical flashes.\nOptical evidence of electron precipitation seen in the\n3835 flashes would give a more realistic image of acceleration;\nimpulsive acceleration of electrons occurs in each individual\nflux loop with a time constant less than 10 sec and the place\nof acceleration moves around with the same time scale.\n\nSince\n\nthe flux loops have small cross sections at their ends\n\n(0.5",\n\nsize of the flashes) and stretch flat on the surface as Ha\nfibrils structure shows, the acceleration must have taken place\n\n-21-\n\nev\n\nat a low height (h < 109cm) and in limited regions.\ntarget emission of x-rays\n\nThick\n\n(Hudson, 1972) is realistic since\n\nmost of the electron energy is dumped in a short time at the\nhigh density layer.\n\nEven if trapped electrons exist and emit\n\nx-rays by thin foil, the emission must be small compared to\nthe observed flux, which could be emitted in denser layers by\nelectrons needed to explain the optical flashes.\nRadio spectra observed by Castelli\n\n(Figure 14)\n\nshow an\n\nincrease of flux from 15 GHz to 35 GHz with a dip around 15 GHz.\nIn coincidence with the end of the 3835 flashes and the x-ray\nflux in the hardest channels the flux at 35 GHz decreased\nappreciably showing a single peak spectrum by 18:40:40.\n\nIf\n\nthe dip in the otherwise flat spectrum is not an observational\neffect, it might be explained by free-free absorption due to\nhot ambient plasma, which has been proposed by Zirin et. al.\n(1971) and by Ramaty and Petrosian\nspectrum.\n\n(1972) to explain flat type\n\nIn order to realize a dip in the spectrum, it turns\n\nout that there must be an optically thick plasma for free-free\nabsorption at the frequency at least 40 GHz.\n\nSince hot plasma\n\nemitting soft x-rays is transparent for free-free absorption\ndown to 4 GHz as the observed emission measure and temperature\nshow, lower temperature material such as produced the XUV\nflash must be invoked for the absorption in this model.\n\nThe\n\ndouble-peaked spectra may also be interpreted as originating\nfrom two sources; one at the top of the flux loops, where\nacceleration takes place with lower magnetic field and plasma\ndensity and giving a peak at 5000 MHz, and the other is located\n\nRadio Spectrum\n\xc2\xb7\n\nI\n\nI\n\n18 39 40\n18 39 14\n\n7-\n\nN\n\nI\n\n102\n\n818\n\n40 40\n\nC\\\n\nCM\n\n0\n1X\n\n2-\n\n10 -\n\nI\n\nI\n\n10o\'\n\n10"\n\nzv (Hz)\nFigure 14\nMicrowave spectrum for the 18:38 flare of August 2 obtained by Castelli.

This does not agree with\nthe thick foil picture.\n\nOn the other hand, when we consider a\n\nflux loop model in which acceleration takes place continuously\nfor 10 seconds or less at the top, and electrons dump at the\ntwo ends of the loop emitting x-rays there by thick foil, the\ntotal number of electrons in the flux loop at any instant can\nbe determined by the continuity equation along the flux loop:\nv\n\nN1 0 0\nL\n\ndN 1 0 0\ndt\n\n, where L is a length of flux loop.\n\nWith v -\n\nC\n\nand L - 2 x 10 9 cm (observed mean distance between pair flashes)\nas well as\n\ndN 100\n\ndt\n\nfrom the thick foil model we have N100- 2.1 x 10\n\n32\n\n-23-\n\nin agreement with N1\nof two source models.\n\n32\n\n- 1032 obtained for the 5000 MHz peak\nTo derive the latter number, optically\n\nthin gyrosynchrotron emission is assumed with the peak emission\noccurring at\n\n3 vB\n\n(Takakura, 1967) since self-absorption would\n\nbe negligible in a small cross section of a flux loop such as\nis considered here.\nA = 2 x 1018cm\n\n(N100 = 1032 together with B = 500 G and\n\ngives a self-absorption factor N\n\nBA\n\n10\n\n, which\n\nagrees approximately with the calculated curve by Ramaty and\nPetrosian\n\n(1972) if we adopt the electron power equal to 4.5\n\nobtained from the thick foil in this case.)\n\nFor the higher\n\nfrequency peak we get a similar value for a magnetic field\nlarger than 1000 G although we don\'t know the exact frequency\nand flux of the peak.\n\nThus we can explain the radio flux in\n\nthis simple model of a flux loop consistently with thick foil\nx-ray emission and the 3835 flashes.\n\nIt is to be noted that\n\nthe electron distribution exponent y (N (E) a E Y)\n\nderived\n\nfrom the high frequency slope of the radio spectrum at 18:40:40\n(single peak is equal to y = 4.7, in agreement with y = 4.9\nderived from the hard x-ray spectrum assuming thick foil.\n\nIn\n\nthe thin foil model, on the other hand, we have y = 3.0, inconsistent with the radio value.\n\n-24- -\n\nVI.\n\nDEVELOPMENTS AUGUST 3 TO 4\n\nAfter the great events of August 2, the region changed\nrapidly:\n\nthe spot fl continued to grow and plow into the\n\np region, P2 and p 3\n\nsplit apart and a small EFR appeared be-\n\ntween Pi and fl, eventually producing some new p spots.\naxis of P 2\n\nThe\n\n- P 3 rotated rapidly as p 3 moved eastward, proA\n\nducing further shear along the neutral line.\nsmall flares occurred during August 3,\n\nseries of\n\nthe largest being at\n\n22:10, with arms around fl and area between P 2\n\nand f3 ,\n\nwhere\n\nf3 was approaching ever closer to P 2 .\nWhen the sun rose at Tel Aviv on August 4,\nwas beginning;\n\nobservations began at 06:24,\n\nrising to a peak area at 06:35.\n\na great flare\n\nshowing the\n\nflare\n\nBut the most rapid rise\n\noccurred between 06:24 and 06:27, coinciding with steep rise\nand peak in the radio burst.\n\nThe Ha flux 1.0 x 10 27erg/sec\n\n(using August 7 line widths) was constant from 06:25 U.T. to\n06:45 U.T. and decayed slowly.\n\nAs on August 2,\n\n21:45, the\n\ngreatest peak in the radio emission came with brilliant emission covering the f\n\nspot.\n\nFigure 15 shows the peak of the\n\nflare photographed at Tel Aviv.\n\nIt was a classic 2-strand\n\nflare, with most of the area in the f\n\npolarity,\n\nand it did\n\nnot have the irregular growth of the August 2 and 7 flares,\nnor was it so impulsive as the much smaller event of 18:38\nAugust 2,\n\nalthough a rise in radio flux of 26000 sfu in\n\n3 minutes is certainly not sluggish.\nfell off somewhat above 8.8 GHz.\n\nThus its radio\n\nspectrum\n\nThe radio flux reported by\n\nFigure 15\nMaximum of the August 4 flare, 06:34:19, photographed at Tel Aviv.

The filament H was disturned by the flare.\n\n-25-\n\nSlough dropped off after the flare passed maximum.\n\nAt\n\n06:42, a group of bright loops passed across from the p to\nf side, filling the space between the two strands; these\nbecame dark 10 minutes later.\n\nAgain, although the field lines\n\non the surface run tightly parallel to the neutral line, the\nloops high above are perpendicular.\n\nWe see the loops in-\n\ncrease their tilts to the neutral line continuously with time\n(see curve in Figure 19 for this change).\n\nThe bright strands\n\nfaded and separated, leaving two thin strands at the farthest\npoints from the neutral line, lasting many hours.\nthe slow decline of thermal x-ray emission\nequal to 150 minutes),\n\nThis, and\n\n(e-folding time\n\nshows how the coronal cloud produced\n\nby the flare cools from the surface outward, leaving only the\noutermost loops at the end.\n\nThese loops presumably produce\n\nthe Ha strands by thermal conduction at later phases.\nNo Moreton wave appears on the film; although the observations are in Ha centerline, a Moreton wave should be visible.\nHowever, a section 0.6 Rg from the spot of the long filament\nstretching E of the spot\n\n(fiZ 1) disappeared at 06:26;\n\nand an\n\nemerging flux region 0.7 R G from the flare brightened about\nthe same time.\n\nThese distances imply a wave moving 1000 km/sec\n\nfrom a source at 06:18 (the earliest reasonable time, judging\nby radio data), but moving above the chromosphere so that it\nis seen only indirectly.\n\nMore interesting, a bright wave or\n\nspray moved out from a point in the filament about 0.6 R G from\nthe flare at 06:24, with a velocity of 250 km/sec.\n\nThis wave,\n\nwhich moves irregularly N-S from the filament, looks like a\n\n-26-\n\nslow Moreton wave.\n\nIf it was triggered by an invisible wave\n\nfrom the flare, we again get 1,000\n\nkm/sec for the velocity.\n\nThis is the first case we know of of such a spray being\nproduced by a wave.\n\nThe filament waved about continually\n\nuntil 08:00.\nUchida\n\n(1972) has shown that the Moreton wave may be\n\nconsidered as an MHD wave which only touches the surface\nwhen it reaches a region where the Alfven velocity is low and\na steep shock develops.\n\nIt may be that the wave in question\n\ndid not touch the surface, but was able to affect the chromospheric features it passed by perturbing the field structures.\nThe apparent triggering of a slower wave from the prominence\nis obviously a more complicated problem, either involving\nenergy stored in the prominence or refocusing of the wave\nenergy.\n\n-27-\n\nVII.\n\nDEVELOPMENT AUGUST 4 TO 7\n\nIn the BBSO pictures for August 4, we can recognize\nseveral changes which may be connected with the August 4\nflare.\nof P 2 ,\n\nfl and f 2 had grown, and the spot f3 moved in ahead\nalmost touching it.\n\nA\n\ntight filament twisted in be-\n\ntween them, and the field gradient was very large indeed.\nAlthough f3 did not take obvious part in the flares,\n\nits\n\nmotion to west was every bit as remarkable as that of fl--in\nfact on August 6 the\nisland of f\n\nfilament passes around f3 and it is an\n\npolarity inside the p penumbra.\n\nAlthough the\n\ngroup gave the appearance of an extremely active one,\n\nthere\n\nwas in fact little activity aside from the great flares.\nMost of the smaller flares were two strand or two-point flares\nwhich may be used to determine the ends of flux loops,\nexample one at 01:02 August 5 connected P 1\nflares connecting p 3\n\nfor\n\nand f 3 and several\n\nand fl.\n\nProbably the most important consequence of the August\nflare was the rapid separation of p 3 from P 2 .\nin the off-band pictures of Figure 4, p 3\nfrom P 2\n\nat dawn on the\n\nAs can be seen\n\nappeared separate\n\n3rd and steadily drew apart, producing\n\na winding in the neutral line between fl and p 3 .\nalso a rapid motion of f2\n\ntowards\n\nThere was\n\nfl after August 4.\n\nThis\n\nmotion occurred in the opposite direction to the movement of\np3 .\n\nIt is likely that both motions worked to increase the\n\nshear of the filament between them.\n\nThese spot motions were\n\ngenerally very slow with a mean velocity 30 m/sec -\n\n50 m/sec.\n\n-28-\n\nBut they occurred steadily and in two or three days there\nwere always noticeable changes in spot configurations as well\nObviously\n\nas large increases of shear in the neutral line.\n\nsuch changes were necessary for a big flare to occur as the\nobserved intervals between big flares show.\nThere were no more flares with footpoints in P 2.\n\nThere\n\nwas considerable small surge activity in the area just following p 3 on the f side of the neutral line.\n\nSuch activity is\n\ncharacteristic of emerging flux, and the magnetograms for\nAugust 4, 5, and 6, in fact, show p polarity which was part\nof the emerging dipole imbedded in the f\n(Figure 6).\n\npolarity region\n\nDark fibrils connected this flux to fl.\n\nEven-\n\ntually on August 7, the p flux broke through and filled this\nregion.\n\nSmall flares at 01:37 and 16:53 on August 5 extended\n\nalong the dark fibrils from the EFR to fl and p 3, while the\nflare at 01:00 had just two bright points at P 1\n\nand f 3.\n\nwas also rapid growth of new p spots following P1\n\nThere\n\nand just\n\nacross the neutral line from fl.\nOn the 6th, the dark filament, fil 1, now stretched all\nthe way through the region and around to the p side.\n\nIt was,\n\nof course, no ordinary filament, but a complex of twisted\ndark fibrils along the neutral line.\nthere\n\nwere\n\n(east-west).\n\npenumbral\n\nSpot p 3\n\nshrank and\n\nfibrils parallel to the neutral line\n\nLarge velocity shear was observed in this\n\npenumbra on August

Note\nthat maximum for the flare area was attained at 15:28 after the widest emission disappeared.\n\n-34-\n\ndecrease from 15:25, but the area of emission was still increasing, showing peaks at 15:28.\n\nThus the total flux of Ha\n\nemission stayed rather constant from 15:20 to 15:28.\nWhen emission spread rapidly from P 2 to all the p and f\narea at 15:22, strong red shifted emission was observed at\nthe outer part (f) of the filament\n\n(Figure 20, 15:23).\n\nFil-\n\ntergrams showed much more intense emissions in the red wing\nthan in the blue wing over the whole f\np area.\n\narea and part of the\n\nEmission appeared 2 A to the red with a Gaussian\n\nprofile with an equivalent Doppler width of 2.9 A.\n\nThis lasted\n\nThis red shift cannot be\n\nfor 5 minutes and faded after 15:27.\n\ndue to the projection effect of horizontal motion, for the\ndirection of the spread of emission is largely toward us.\n\nThus\n\nit must be due to downward moving atoms or downward moving\nexciters.\n\nIt should be noted that a dark red shifted feature\n\nwas seen for ten minutes before emission occurred at the same\nplace (Figure 20 at 15:17).\n\nThe total energy of the red shifted\n\nemission is estimated as equal to 6 x 10\n\n28\n\nergs, which is only\n\na small fraction of the energy of non-thermal electrons.\n\nIn\n\nkernel 1, the blue side of the emission was enhanced after\n15:36, and the peak was seen at 0.6\n(Figure 20).\nemission\n\nA\n\nblue from 15:40 on\n\nAt the same time, kernel 2 showed doubly peaked\n\n(Figure 20), the peak occurring at 0.5 A on both wings.\n\nThis doubly peaked profile is characteristic of flare emission\nright above the sunspot umbra.\n\nThe blue asymmetry can be\n\nattributed to excess absorption in the red wing since the continuum was depressed in the far red wing.\n\nAfter the rapid\n\n-35- a-\n\nspread of the flare the red-shifted emission was replaced by\nrelatively narrow emission symmetric about the line center.\nWe must emphasize that all the emission, shifted or unshifted, occurring outside the kernels was relatively narrow\nand weak compared to the great emission from the flare kernel\nitself.\n\nWe can conclude that the main energetic flare occurs\n\nin the kernels, and the outer areas are "lit up" as the flare\nenergy spreads to higher flux loops and hot red-shifted material\nrains down on the surface.\n\nThe small red asymmetry in the\n\nkernel may be due to superposition of the downward falling\nbright material which covers the flare area or precipitating\nparticles.\nThe Ha width dropped below 1 X after 15:45 even in the\nstrongest kernel.\nLate in the flare, spectra were obtained in various\nspectral regions, scanning over the whole flare area.\n\nThey\n\nshow a remarkable velocity discontinuity along the neutral\nline between fli\n\nf2 and p 3 in a region which shows penumbra\n\nbut no sunspot (Figure 22, x on the slit).\n\nThe shear is seen\n\nin the spectrum to occur in all spectrum lines, it amounts to\n4 to 5 km/sec to the red side, irrespective of line strength,\nor over 6 km/sec if the motion is in the surface plane of the\nsun.\n\nThe motion was seen in spectra up to 19:00, whereupon\n\nit stopped.\nOff-band pictures before and after the flare show a large\nchange in the direction of the penumbral filaments in this\narea (just above the x on the slit in Figure 22); at 15:00 U.T.\n\n5100A\n\n15 00 UT\n\n5900 A\n\n2050 UT\nFigure 22\n\nThe velocity shear observed during the flare of August 7 (arrow) in spectra taken at 5100 R and 5900 A.\nThe off-band picture at 15:00 shows the slit orientation and the place of the velocity shear (point x).\nThe velocity shift is to the red (4 - 5 km/sec) and appears for all the lines. Note that the direction of the penumbral filaments at point x changed after the flare (20:50) as if the flow occurred\nalong the boundary of the penumbra (p3 ) towards the arrow shown in the lower right.\n\n-36-\n\nthese filaments were directed to the northwest or to the\ndirection of the slit in Figure 22, while at 20:50 U.T. their\ndirection changed to the southwest, producing a kink between\nthese penumbral filaments and those in fl.\n\nThis change can\n\nbe explained by the sheared flow in the surface plane seen in\nthe spectra, which dragged the penumbral filaments to the\nsouthwest direction.\n\nWe only measure radial velocity, so the\n\ndirection of motion may only be deduced from observed changes\nin penumbral fibrils and the neutral line.\nthis motion\n\nThe direction of\n\n(perpendicular to the neutral line)\n\nis such as to\n\nincrease the shear of the magnetic field lines, as though the\nphotospheric flow is inexorably pushing on either side or it,\nfinally to be released by the flare.\n\nThere was actually an\n\nincrease in the shear observed in this part of the fibril from\nAugust 6 to the time of the flare.\n\nNote that this flow was\n\nperpendicular to the motion of spot f 2 towards fl which was\nalong the neutral line. The activation of the filament along a\nsegment before the flare is shown in Figure 16 to occur at the\nsoutheast edge\npenumbra\n\n(A), along a segment anchored in the moving\n\n(also see dark feature at 15:00 U.T. in Figure 22).\n\nStudy of before-after pairs shows some change in the spot\ngroup after the flare.\n\nThe east penumbras of fl and f2 shrank\n\nappreciably, and P 2 and p 3 umbras shrank rapidly.\n\nA few small\n\nspots under the p kernel changed, but such spots are always\nchanging.\n\nThere was continued motion of spot f2 toward fl,\n\nwhich it joined on the 10th.\n\n(The largest motion 0.42 km/sec\n\nwas found during the flare from 15:00 U.T. to 18:00 U.T.)\n\nThe\n\n-37-\n\nmagnetograms show a decrease in the f\n\npolarity in the area\n\nit vacates, and a general southeast expansion of the p polarity\naround p3 .\n\nThe large filament S-W of the p spots, which was\n\nactive all day on the 7th on the blue wing, disappeared.\nFurther evolution of the group to its limb passage is shown\nin Figure 5.\n\nIt gradually simplified and was uninteresting\n\nexcept for the limb flare of the 11th.\n\n-38-\n\nX.\n\nHa FLUX\n\nThere has been much attention paid to the total Ha flux\nfrom great flares in comparison with the total energy.\n\nIn\n\nthis case, with continuous Ha spectra and filtergrams on both\nwings of Ha, we can measure this in a more definitive way.\nplanimetered dark prints\nnels at 15:20,\n\n(Figure 18)\n\n15:27 and 16:00 U.T.\n\nshowing two intense ker(the end of Ha spectra).\n\nAt 15:20 U.T., the area of the kernels was\nband width 9.2 eq.\ntinuum).\n\n6.0 x 10 18cm 2\n\nwith\n\n(equivalent engstroms referred to the con-\n\nAt 15:27, the area of the kernels had increased to\n\n8.5 x 10 1 8 cm 2\nto 1.4 x\n\nA\n\nWe\n\nwith 6.2 eq.\n\nA\n\n1018 cm2 with 1.8 eq.\n\nintegrated Ha fluxes are\n\nwidth, and at 16:00 it decreased\n\nA\n\nwidth.\n\nTime histories of the\n\nshown in Figure 21 for three places.\n\nThe total flare area in Ha centerline was\n\n4.3 x\n\n1019, but the\n\nline width over most of the area was only about 1 eq.
