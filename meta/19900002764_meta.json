Background parameters are derived from aerosol data sets with global-scale spatial and/or temporal coverage, using objective statistical decomposition and/or a priori stratification based on supplementary data. Backscatter coefficients at the LAWS design wavelength are derived from background aerosol physical, chemical, and optical data, or from direct backscatter measurements at other wavelengths, using background conversion factors. Direct measurements of aerosol backscatter at 10.6 microns from the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) and the Wave Propagation Laboratory (WPL) were selected. The RSRE backscatter data processing code were optimized under low backscatter conditions, performed detailed analyses of collocated intercomparisons between the two lidars, and assisted in the analysis of the long-term backscatter climatologies from the two lidars. Timely presentation of global backscattering experiment (GLOBE) research results to the global geophysical community is required.", "title": "Global backscatter assessment", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900002764, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bowdle, David A."}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama Univ.", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "a01d1cfad3464803b1070c70c7e68ad2"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900002764, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900002764, "id": "2724020cc367468c94269f1b3be4c71a", "publicationName": "NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA(MSFC FY88 Global Scale Atmospheric Processes Research Program Review", "publicationDate": "1989-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900002764.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900002764/downloads/19900002764.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900002764/downloads/19900002764.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900002764/downloads/19900002764.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
