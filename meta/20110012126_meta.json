This methodology allows for the examination of whole landscapes of potential outcomes and provides the capability of executing enough experiments so that outliers might be captured and examined for insights. It can be used to conduct sensitivity studies, to support validation and verification of models, to iteratively optimize outputs using heuristic search and discovery, and as an aid to decision-makers in understanding complex relationships of factors. In this paper we describe efforts at the Naval Postgraduate School in developing these new and emerging tools. We also discuss data farming in the context of application to questions inherent in military decision-making. The particular application we illustrate here is social network modeling to support the countering of improvised explosive devices.", "title": "Data Farming and Defense Applications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-25T07:36:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20110012126, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Horne, Gary"}, "organization": {"name": "Naval Postgraduate School", "location": "Monterey, CA, United States"}}, "id": "d3135f11b296487ea557daa9403072ac"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20110012126, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Meyer, Ted"}, "organization": {"name": "Naval Postgraduate School", "location": "Monterey, CA, United States"}}, "id": "4f58d2c2fbb9423f91fe06faf027029e"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20110012126, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110012126, "id": "488c098d02ec4212bda7cc1585a270da", "publicationName": "Selected Papers and Presentations Presented at MODSIM World 2010 Conference and Expo", "publicationDate": "2011-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20110012100, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Selected Papers and Presentations Presented at MODSIM World 2010 Conference and Expo", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110012126.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110012126/downloads/20110012126.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110012126/downloads/20110012126.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110012126/downloads/20110012126.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
