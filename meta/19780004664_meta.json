It is shown that the shape of the weighting functions depends on the nature of the pressure and temperature dependence of the transmittance, which differ from one part of the spectrum to another as well as with spectral resolution. It is shown that careful selection of channels results in much narrower weighting functions than those corresponding to channels that have actually been used.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780004664, "id": "2f44c28d7bec49e6817833095080714d", "publicationName": "NASA.
