Due to the growing trade between Asia and the United States, a transpacific range was chosen for the aircraft. A Mach number of 2.2 was chosen, too, because it provides reasonable block times and allows the use of a large range of materials without a need for active cooling. A payload of 2,500 lbs. was assumed corresponding to a complement of nine passengers and crew, plus some light cargo. With these general requirements set, the class was broken down into three groups. The aerodynamics of the aircraft were the responsibility of the first group. The second developed the propulsion system. The efforts of both the aerodynamics and propulsion groups were monitored and reviewed for weight considerations and structural feasibility by the third group. Integration of the design required considerable interaction between the groups in the final stages. The fuselage length of the final conceptual design was 107.0 ft, while the diameter of the fuselage was 7.6 ft. The delta wing design consisted of an aspect ratio of 1.9 with a wing span of 47.75 ft and mid-chord length of 61.0 ft. A SNECMA MCV 99 variable-cycle engine design was chosen for this aircraft.", "title": "Tesseract supersonic business transport", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940021220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reshotko, Eli"}, "organization": {"name": "Case Western Reserve Univ.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "0bf066914ff34456829ae913f0e7d669"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940021220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Garbinski, Gary"}, "organization": {"name": "Case Western Reserve Univ.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "9cb8fa167fae422b942a1725c1e24351"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940021220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fellenstein, James"}, "organization": {"name": "Case Western Reserve Univ.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "e901c128f312481c891516f4ddf3d3b2"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19940021220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Botting, Mary"}, "organization": {"name": "Case Western Reserve Univ.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "5a42a84968a843f3828272a208ce798c"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19940021220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hooper, Joan"}, "organization": {"name": "Case Western Reserve Univ.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "b6b4f1f8ba324af59c93a569451a729b"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 19940021220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ryan, Michael"}, "organization": {"name": "Case Western Reserve Univ.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "bac0472299df4ed5a14b0fc08585030e"}, {"sequence": 6, "submissionId": 19940021220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Struk, Peter"}, "organization": {"name": "Case Western Reserve Univ.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "91b6518d6e2e41ee98ad4f2ce5a4b248"}, {"sequence": 7, "submissionId": 19940021220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Taggart, Ben"}, "organization": {"name": "Case Western Reserve Univ.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "23c45def49b84c308010abf5c54cedb7"}, {"sequence": 8, "submissionId": 19940021220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Taillon, Maggie"}, "organization": {"name": "Case Western Reserve Univ.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "a5db5514cc6c40768fec50dd21fc980d"}, {"sequence": 9, "submissionId": 19940021220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Warzynski, Gary"}, "organization": {"name": "Case Western Reserve Univ.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "973423c316e84aeabc37a608b04e538b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940021220, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940021220, "id": "32f4b19fef1740edbcb7b719e609d8e3", "publicationName": "USRA, Proceedings of the 8th Annual Summer Conference: NASA(USRA Advanced Design Program", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940020711, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "New Technologies for Space Avionics, 1993", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940021220.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940021220/downloads/19940021220.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940021220/downloads/19940021220.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940021220/downloads/19940021220.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
