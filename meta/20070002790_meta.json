Enabling technologies must be developed and implemented that will allow this goal to be financially and technically feasible. The optical systems needed far high spatial resolution surveillance and astronomical applications require large optical, apertures with mention of future systems up to 150 meter in diameter. With traditional optical manufacturing technologies, large optical aperture means high mass and long fabrication lead times with associated high costs. Completely new approaches to optical fabrication must be developed to enable the fabrication of such optical systems. The cost and lead time associated with the fabrication of lightweight, high quality optical systems limits the feasible size of the optics. A primary factor in the launch cost of space optical systems is volume and mass. To minimize the mass of the high quality optics, optical fabricators implement materials with high specific stiffness and use honeycomb, or other structural minimization patterns, to support the optical surface; however, the structure must still be designed to survive launch loads. This sigmficantly adds to the fabrication difficulty and dramatically increases launch costs. One approach to minimizing launch volume and negating the need for the design to survive launch loads is to send the manufacturing facility and raw materials into space and perform the fabrication in-situ. We, are currently performing feasibility studies of initial concepts for inspace manufacturing of optical systems. By utilizing the micro-gravity and vacuum environment of space while eliminating the constraints defined by high launch forces and limited volume of the launch vehicle, the development of large, high quality glass membrane mirrors may be feasible. Several concepts were investigated to address the manufacturing of both optical surfaces and telescope structure. We will describe one of the primary approaches to utilize the space environment for optical manufacturing and describe initial results.", "title": "Larger, Lighter Space Telescopes by Implementing In-Space Manufacturing Concepts", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T00:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20070002790, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mooney, James t."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "d5adc8a35c8344fa88620222279d0159"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20070002790, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gregory, Don"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "125e07c6f03149c6bedc3cd16f8d66be"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20070002790, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Herren, Ken"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "dc563aaf36e14e398753dc59a301cac8"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 20070002790, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Howsman, Tom"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "58d77bd7c0744b60be7d3113afad81bf"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070002790, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070002790, "id": "3c3e9e47e3e44bf1b29e7003221e7f9b", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070002790.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070002790/downloads/20070002790.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070002790/downloads/20070002790.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070002790/downloads/20070002790.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
