In general, the sensors are used\nin situ to measure the environment at a given location within a turbine engine, or\nto measure the response of an engine component to the imposed environment.\nLocations of concern are generally in the gas path and, for the most part, are\nwithin the hot section. Specific parameters of concern are dynamic gas temperature,\nheat flux, airfoil surface temperature, and strain on airfoils and combustor\nliners. In order to minimize the intrusiveness of surface-mounted sensors, a\nconsiderable effort has been expended to develop thin-film sensors for surface\ntemperature, strain, and heat flux measurements. Most of the work described is\nsufficiently advanced that sensors have been used and useful data have been\nobtained. The notable exception is the work to develop a high-temperature static\nstrain measuring capability; this work is still in progress. The work described\nhere has been done in-house at the Lewis Research Center and via contracts and\ngrants.\n\nPREEDmG PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\n4- 7\n\nRESEARCH SENSORS\nThe program described here covers development of sensors and sensing techniques for\nresearch applications on aeropropulsion systems. In general, the sensors are used\nin situ to either measure the environment at a given location within a turbine engine\nor to measure the response of an engine component to the imposed environment.\nLocations of concern are generally in the gas path and, for the most part, are\nwithin the hot section of the engine. Since these sensors are used for research\ntesting as opposed to operational use, a sensor lifetime of the order of 50 hours is\nconsidered sufficient.\n\nRESEARCH SENSORS\nMINIATURE DISCRETE SENSORS FOR IN SITU RESEARCH MEASUREMENTS IN\nAEROPROPULSION SYSTEMS:\nDYNAMIC GAS TEMPERATURE MEASURING SYSTEM\nTOTAL HEAT FLUX SENSORS\nTHIN-FILM SENSORS\nHIGH-TEMPERATURE STRAIN MEASURING SYSTEMS\n\nCD-87-29396\n\n4- 8\n\nDYNAMIC GAS TEMPERATURE MEASURING SYSTEM\nOne of the most important environmental parameters in a turbine engine hot section\nis gas temperature. Normally only time-average temperature is measured.\nFluctuations in gas temperatures are, however, of great concern for hot section\ndurability and combustor modeling activities. In this measuring system, a probe\nwith two wire thermocouples with different diameters provides dynamic signals with\nlimited frequency response. By comparing these signals over a range of frequencies,\nwe can generate a compensation spectrum sufficient to provide compensated temperature\ndata at frequencies up t o 1000 Hz.\n\nDYNAMIC GAS TEMPERATURE MEASURING SYSTEM\nMEASURES GAS TEMPERATURE\nFLUCTUATIONS AT THE EXIT OF A\nTURBINE ENGINE COMBUSTOR\n\nA TWO-ELEMENT PROBE PROVIDES\nDATA TO PERMIT ACCURATE\nFREQUENCY COMPENSATION\n\nCD-87-29397\n\n4-9\n\nDYNAMIC GAS TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT\nThis figure shows dynamic temperature data obtained from a probe at the turbine\ninlet of a PWA F-100 engine operating at an intermediate power setting. The plot on\nthe left is the dynamic signal from a 0.003-in.-diameter wire thermocouple with no\nfrequency compensation. The rms value of the temperature fluctuation is 74 O F . The\nplot on the right is the compensated signal from the same thermocouple. The rms\nvalue of the temperature fluctuation is 390 O F and the peak-to-peak fluctuation is\n2900 O F .\nSuch a large temperature fluctuation implies that there are filaments of\nprimary combustion gas and dilution gas within the combustor exhaust stream.\n\nDYNAMIC GAS TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT\n\nI\n\nTEMPERATURE AT TURBINE INLET\n\nI\n\nTEMPERATURE,\n"F\n\n+400\n\nTEMPERATURE,\n"F\n74\xc2\xb0F RMS\n\n]\n\n+1500\n+ 1000\n\n+ 200\n0\n\n1\n\n390\xc2\xb0F RMS\nI\n\n1\n\n0\n\n- 200\n\n- 1000\n\n4\n\n-400\n0\n\n250\n\n-1500\n\n500\n\n1\n0\n\nJ\n250\n\n500\n\nTIME, msec\nCD-87-29398\n\n4- 10\n\nTOTAL HEAT FLUX SENSORS\nAnother environmental parameter of interest for hot section durability is total heat\nflux. We have developed miniature total heat flux sensors which can be welded into\ncombustor liners and built into cooled turbine airfoils. This figure shows one\nsensor configuration based on the Gardon Gage design. An innovation in these\nsensors is the use of the burner liner or airfoil material as part of a differential\nthermocouple circuit. Calibration tests on these materials showed that this\ntechnique could provide acceptable signals. The differential themocouple simplifies\nconstruction and permits a direct measurement of the differential temperature\nproportional to heat flux. These miniature heat flux sensors must be calibrated\nover the temperature range in which they will be used.\n\nTOTAL HEAT FLUX SENSORS\nMEASURE TOTAL HEAT FLUX ON\nHIGH TEMPERATURE HEAT FLUX SENSOR\n\\ \\\nBURNER LINERS AND TURBINE\nAIRFOILS\nMINIATURE WIRE THERMOCOUPLE\nSENSOR:\nWELD INTO BURNER LINERS\nBUILD INTO AIRFOILS\nSENSOR BODY PART OF\nTHERMOCOUPLE CIRCUIT\n\nCALIBRATION SYSTEM REQUIRED\n/\n...\n....\n....\n....\n....\n....\n....\n....\n....\n....\n...\n\n....\n::::::.s. :i;r\n\n.......\n..............\n.......\n......\nI\n..........\n,\n.:.>:.:.:.:.:\n\nWALL\n\nCD-87-29399\n\n4-11\n\nCOMBUSTOR SEGMENT INSTRUMENTED WITH HEAT FLUX SENSORS\nThis photograph shows a segment of a combustor liner which has been instrumented\nwith six total heat f l u x sensors. The sensors are 0.3-in.-diameter disks with\nthermocouple leads radiating from the edge of the disk. The actual sensor part of\nthe unit is at the center of the disk and is only 0.06 in. in diameter. The sensors\nare individually calibrated and then welded into holes cut in the liner. Tests on\ncombustors such as this one have produced useful heat flux data over a range of\ncombustor operating conditions. Similar sensors built into turbine airfoils\nhave been less successful because of the sensitivity of these sensors to temperature\nand/or heat f l u gradients which are more prevalent in turbine airfoils. Sensor\ndesigns which are less sensitive to gradients have been examined but have not yet\nbeen put into use.\n\nI\n\nCOMBUSTOR SEGMENT INSTRUMENTED WITH HEAT FLUX SENSORS\n\nCD-07-29400\n\n4-12\n\nHEAT FLUX SENSOR CALIBRATION SYSTEM\nThis photograph shows a heat flux sensor calibration system developed at Lewis. The\nheat source is a 400-kW arc lamp. A reflector is used to focus the energy from the\narc onto a ceramic sensor holder. This system can supply a maximum flux of 6 MW/m2,\nwhich is higher than the heat fluxes in present-day turbine engines. The system can\noperate in both steady-state and transient modes. Two other roughly comparable\ncalibration facilities exist in this country; efforts have been started to\ncross-compare calibration of test sensors. This is especially important since a\nnational standard for heat f l u sensor calibration does not exist.\n\nCD-87-29401\n\n4- 13\n\nTHIN-FILM SENSORS\n\nLewis has been the major advocate and sponsor for development of thin-film sensors\nfor turbine engine applications. Thin-film sensors applicable to turbine engines\ninclude temperature sensors, strain gages, and heat f l u sensors. Thin-film sensors\nare formed directly on the component to be instrumented by first depositing a\nsuitable insulating film and then depositing sensor and protective films as required.\n\nTHIN-FILM SENSORS\n\nr -INSULATING FILM\nTEMPERATURE SENSORS\n\nCOVER FILM\n\n\\\n\\\n\n\\\n\nSTRAIN GAGES:\nDYNAMIC\nSTATIC\nHEAT FLUX SENSORS\nSENSOR STRUCTURE\n\nCD-87-29402\n\n4- 14\n\nTHIN-FILM THERMOCOUPLES\nexcellent application for thin-film thermocouples is the measurement of the\nsurface temperature of a cooled turbine airfoil such as shown here. The surface of\nthe vane is covered with A1203 thermally grown from an anticorrosion coating and\naugmented with sputtered Al2O3. Pt and Pt-Rh films are sputter deposited with\nthermocouple junctions formed by overlapping the two films at the desired spot. The\nfilms extend to the base of the vane where 1eadwj.res are connected. The sensor is\nless than 0.001 in. thick. This technique has considerable advantages over the\nprevious technology, which required swaged thermocouple wires to be buried in\ngrooves cut in the surface.\nAn\n\nTHIN-FILM THERMOCOUPLES\nMEASURE SURFACE TEMPERATURE\nOF COOLED TURBINE AIRFOILS\nFABRICATION: SPUTTER ALLOY\nFILM LEADS OVER INSULATING\nCOATING ON AIRFOIL SURFACE\nSENSOR THICKNESS, ~ 0 . 0 0 1\nin.\n\nCD-87-29403\n\n4-15\n\nI\nI\n\nAPPLICATIONS OF THIN-FILM SENSORS\nTwo types of thin-film sensors have been used in regularly scheduled test operations\nat some turbine engine facilities in the United States. Dynamic strain gages have\nbeen used on compressor blades, and thermocouples have been used to measure turbine\nairfoil surface temperatures. A thin-film, high-temperature static strain gage\nsystem and thin-film heat flux sensors are still under development. One of our\ngoals is to make the thin-film sensor technology available to the entire United\nStates turbine engine community. Impediments to wider use of this technology are\nmany. One problem is that sensor fabrication is material specific; technology has\nnot been established for a wide variety of materials. Another problem is that the\ninvestment required to establish a thin-film sensor fabrication capability is\nconsiderable; commercial services for custom fabrication of thin-film sensors are\nnot yet available.\n\nAPPLICATIONS OF THIN-FILM SENSORS\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nDYNAMIC STRAIN GAGES IN USE ON COMPRESSOR BLADES AT SOME FACILITIES\nTHERMOCOUPLES IN USE ON TURBINE AIRFOILS AT SOME FACILITIES\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nSTATIC STRAIN GAGES AND HEAT FLUX SENSORS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT\nIMPEDIMENTS TO WIDER USAGE:\nTECHNOLOGY NOT ESTABLISHED FOR ALL MATERIALS\nLARGE INVESTMENT REQUIRED\nCOMMERCIAL SERVICES FOR FABRICATING SENSORS NOT YET AVAILABLE\n\nCD-87-29404\n\n4- 16\n\nHIGH-TEMPERATURE STRAIN MEASURING SYSTEMS\nThe most ambitious goal of the research sensor program is the development of\nhigh-temperature (1800 O F ) strain measuring systems. Approaches being followed in\nthis work include both wire and thin-film resistance strain gages and remote\nmeasuring systems. Our resistance strain gage work has included work on new strain\ngage materials and testing of available strain gages, including the Chinese 700 OC\ngages. Work on remote strain measuring systems has involved three different system\nconcepts based on laser speckle patterns.\n\nHIGH-TEMPERATURE STRAIN MEASURING SYSTEMS\nGOAL:\nMEASURE STATIC STRAIN ON TEST SAMPLES AND TURBINE ENGINE COMPONENTS AT\nF\nTEMPERATURES UP TO 1800 O\nAPPROACHES:\nRESISTANCE STRAIN GAGESWIRE GAGES\n\nTHIN-FILM GAGES\nREMOTE STRAIN MEASURING SYSTEMLASER SPECKLE BASED SYSTEM\n\nCD-87-29405\n\n4- 1 7\n\nFUTURE THRUSTS IN RESEARCH SENSORS\nFuture work in research sensors will be strongly influenced by new materials being\ndeveloped for turbine engine components. These materials are expected to be in the\nforms of metal- and ceramic-matrix composites. Both the nature of the materials and\nthe significantly higher hot section temperatures that these materials are expected\nto make possible will influence our sensor work. If thin-film sensors are to be\napplied to these materials, methods for producing suitable insulating films must be\ndeveloped. A s surface temperatures rise, the temperature limits of available sensor\nmaterials will force more emphasis on remote noncontact sensing techniques. I n\naddition, we will continue to search for new sensor materials with higher temperature\ncapabilities. Work has already started in these directions relative to surface\ntemperature, strain, and heat flux measurements on ceramic and ceramic-matrix\ncomposite materials.\n\nFUTURE THRUSTS IN RESEARCH SENSORS\nPROGRAM TO DEVELOP MATERIALS TO OPERATE AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER HOT\nSECTION TEMPERATURES-METAL-AND CERAMIC-MATRIX COMPOSITES\nEFFECT ON SENSOR PROGRAMS:\nDEVELOP TECHNOLOGY FOR THIN-FILM SENSORS ON NEW SUBSTRATE MATERIALS\nDEVELOP SENSOR MATERIALS FOR HIGHER TEMPERATURE RANGES\nIMPROVE REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES\n\nCD-87-29406\n\n4-18\n\n'
