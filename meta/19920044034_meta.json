These chondrules have unusual mineralogies dominated by highly and asymmetrically zoned Al-Cr-rich spinels. Two alternatives exist to explain the origin of this zoning-fractional crystallization or metamorphism. Fractional crystallization formed the zoning of the trivalent cations and caused a localized depletion in chromites around the large Al-Cr-rich spinels. Diffusive exchange and partitioning of Fe and Mg between olivine and spinel during parent-body metamorphism can explain the asymmetric zoning of these elements. The bulk compositions of the chondrules suggest affinities with the Na-Al-Cr-rich chondrules, as would be expected from the abundance of Al-Cr-rich spinels. The most important factors are the temperature to which the molten chondrule was heated and the cooling rate during crystallization. These two chondrules cooled rapidly from near the liquidus, as indicated by the zoning, occurrence and sizes of spinels, radiating chondrule textures and localized chromite depletions.", "title": "Spinel-bearing, Al-rich chondrules in two chondrite finds from Roosevelt County, New Mexico - Indicators of nebular and parent body processes", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T14:32:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920044034, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mccoy, Timothy J."}, "organization": {"name": "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "location": "Honolulu, United States"}}, "id": "c988882098b140a68710b3fcd62a9b7f"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920044034, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pun, Aurora"}, "organization": {"name": "New Mexico, University", "location": "Albuquerque, United States"}}, "id": "ba35fdccf88547f5b2fefab5ec675b29"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920044034, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Keil, Klaus"}, "organization": {"name": "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "location": "Honolulu, United States"}}, "id": "e62972547c0d416893a72ef7f535ef19"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920044034, "publications": [{"volume": "26", "submissionId": 19920044034, "issn": "0026-1114", "id": "24d33be2817b48ad960f1dd42dbd53d7", "publicationName": "Meteoritics", "publicationDate": "1991-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
