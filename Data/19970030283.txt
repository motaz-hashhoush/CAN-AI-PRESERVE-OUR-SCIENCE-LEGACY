This was to\nhave been a few months before the launch of NASA\'s first Great Observatory,\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (HST.\nAs one of five scientific instruments\non HST, the GHRS was\ndesigned to obtain spectra\nin the 1050-3300 fl_ ultraviolet\nwavelength\nregion with a resolving\n\npower,\n\nA/AA,\n\nof up to 100,000\n\nand relative\n\nphotometric\n\naccuracy\n\nto 1%. It was\n\nbuilt built by Ball AeroSpace\nSystems Group under the guidance of the GHRS Investigation Definition\nTeam (IDT), comprised\nof 16 scientists\nfrom the US and Canada.\nAfter\nlaunch, the IDT was to perform the initial instrument\ncalibration\nand execute a broad\nscientific\n\nprogram\n\nduring\n\na five-year\n\nGuaranteed\n\nTime\n\nObservation\n\n(GTO)\n\nperiod.\n\nAfter a year\'s delay, the launch of HSToccurred\nin April 1990, and CSC participated\nin the in-orbit calibration\nand first four years of GTO observations\nwith the IDT. This\nwas a time of exceptional\nchallenges for the team, and some frustrations.\nWhile eagerly\nexploiting\nnew opportunities\nopened by the GHRS,\nteam members\nwere disappointed\nwith what seemed to be an endless string of impediments\nto the science program.\nThe\nIIST primary\nmirror suffered from spherical\naberration,\nspectral\nresolution\nof Large Science Aperture\n(LSA)\n\nwhich reduced the spatial\nobservations\nand decreased\n\nand\nthe\n\nthroughput\nof the Small Science Aperture\n(SSA) by a factor of two. Periodic problems\nwith the Side 1 carrousel electronics\nand anomalies\nwith the low-voltage\npower supply\nfinally resulted in a suspension\nof the use of Side 1 less than two years after launch.\nAnd\nalthough\nthere was an expectation\nthat in-orbit operations\nwould be immature\nat the\nbeginning\nof the mission, inefficiencies\nin the ground system and errors in implementing\nthe team\'s science program often slashed the available time on-target\nfor many objects\nin the GTO program.\nMuch\n\nof this was to change\n\nwith the HST\n\nfirst servicing\n\nmission\n\nin December\n\n1993.\n\nThe Corrective\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement\n(COSTAR)\nunit was to correct spherical\naberration\nat the instrument\nfocal plane, albeit with the addition\nof two\noptical reflections that effectively eliminated\nobservations\nfrom 1050-1150 _. The GHRS\nRedundancy\nKit, to be bolted to the GHRS structure\nand cabled between the HSTand\nGHRS\n\nelectronics,\n\nprovided\n\nresumption\nof Side 1 operations\nIt was in this context\nthat\n\na direct\n\ninterface\n\nto the\n\nSide 2 electronics,\n\nenabling\n\nthe\n\nwithout fear of losing Side 2 communications.\nthe follow-on contract\nfor the GHRS SSC was awarded\n\nto CSC. This report summarizes\nthe accomplishments\nof that work, covering the period\nfrom December\n13, 1993, during the HSTfirst\nservicing mission, to December,\n12, 1996,\ntwo months before the removal of the GHRS from HST in second servicing\nmission.\nThe GHRS SSC had two principal\nfor the entire IDT, such as archiving\nproviding\ndata analysis\nby Advanced\nComputer\n\nassistance\nConcepts,\n\nassociates\n\nto assist\n\nprograms.\noperations\n\nTo broaden the foundation\nand research organization,\n\nfunctions.\nHST data\n\nFirst, it was to supply science support\nat a central\nrepository\nat GSFC and\n\nwith the team\'s data reduction\nsoftware,\ndeveloped\nInc. (ACC). Secondly,\nit was to provide\nresearch\n\nthe co-investigators\n\nat GSFC\n\nin carrying\n\nfor these functions,\nwhere staff members\n\nout their\n\nindividual\n\nGTO\n\nCSC developed\nan integrated\nassumed multiple duties and\n\nGHRS\n\nSSC\n\nFinal\n\nReport\n\n2\n\nresponsibilities,\ncontributing\nassistance\nwherever needed by the team. This philosophy\nproved itself time and again as new problems, and opportunities,\nunfolded.\nAt the outset, the GHRS SSC tasks involved work in four areas:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To manage\n\nand operate\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To support\n\nthe\n\ngram,\n\nsecond\n\nthe GHRS\nServicing\n\nas well as perform\n\nsystem\n\nData\nMission\n\nAs\n\ntime\n\nadministrative\nactivities\n\nprogressed,\n\nthe infrared\ngroup,\nCatalog of Infrared\n\nfurther\n\nused its GHRS, IUE, and\n(STIS) science operations\ncalibrations,\nresearchers\n\nunder the\ncollaborated\n\n\'programs\nexpanding\n\n1.

To see whether either of these PSFs were realistic, Robinson\nused them\nto construct\nline spread functions\n(LSFs), which were then tested using the data taken\nas part of SMOV proposal 4808. In this proposal, spectra of)/Lupi\nwere taken at several\nwavelengths\nusing the echelle and several first-order\ngratings.\nThese data were obtained\nthrough both the LSA and the SSA. In the analysis, Robinson used the SSA echelle data\nas a "truth"\nspectrum.\nThis spectrum was convolved\nwith a derived LSF appropriate\nto the first-order\n\ngratings\n\nand the result\n\ncompared\n\nwith the first-order\n\nobservations\n\nthat wavelength.\nwhich was found\n\nThe first-order\nSSA data was used to derive the instrumental\nto be a gaussian with FWHM of 0.165 arcsec.\n\nat\n\nprofile,\n\nRobinson worked to determine sensitivity\nand vignetting\ncharacteristics\nof the G160M,\nG200M, G270M, and G140L gratings.\nThe sensitivities\nwere derived using standard\nstar\nfluxes which had been corrected\nby R. Bohlin\nRobinson\nalso determined\nthe blaze functions\n\n(STScI) to the new IUE flux calibrations.\nfor both echelle A and B grating\nmodes.\n\nThe data used were part of the Cycle 4 calibration\nover the free spectral\nrange for all of the orders\n\nplan and consisted\nof spectra\ntaken\nfor both sides.\nThe data were ana-\n\nlyzed by first running a CALHRS analysis for all spectra\ntaken in a given order.\nThis\nanalysis\napplied\na sensitivity\nand rough vignetting\ncurve, but explicitly\navoided\nthe\nripple correction.\nThe\nbetween the measured\n\nindividual spectra were then merged\nfluxes and reference fluxes obtained\n\natlas derived from first-order\nblaze functions\nwere derived\n\ncalibration\nby fitting\n\nand a ratio was determined\nfrom a spectrophotometric\n\ndata. This gave the raw blaze function.\nFinal\na theoretical\ncurve through\nthe observations.\n\nThe curve was based on a single set of grating\nparameters\nfor each echelle mode and\nseveral "fudge factors",\nwhich are needed to get the best fit. He found that a single set\nof correction\nfactors was not sufficient to fit the observations,\nbut that two pairs,\non either side of the echelle blaze maximum,\nwould give a very good fit through\n\none\nthe\n\nentire free spectral\nrange of any given order. Robinson completed\nthe final iterations\nto\nthe sensitivity\nand vignetting\ncalibration\nfiles for all of the first-order\ngratings.\nHe also\ncompleted\nwork on the sensitivity\nand blaze functions\nfor both echelle modes, and the\nfinal versions of the echelle vignetting\nfunction.\nCrenshaw,\nSandoval,\nand Blackwell completed\nan analysis of detector\nbackground\ndata from both GHRS detectors\nafter the installation\nof COSTAR,\nand re-examined\nthe\nentire set of dark count observations\nobtained since launch.

Images were obtained\nwith the GHRS at the positions\nof R136al,\nR136a2,\nand\nR136a5.\n\nThe\n\nR136al\n\nposition\n\nwas the result\n\nof a 5 \xc3\x97 5 SSA\n\npeakup\n\nand\n\nwas to have\n\nboth R136al and R136a2 in the field of view. The second and third images should have\nbeen a fixed distance\nfrom the first. At first glance the images were quite confusing,\nmainly due to the fact that the image center was about four deflection\nthe center of the aperture\nin both the X and Y directions.\nMalumuth\n\nsteps off from\nwrote an IDL\n\nGHRS\n\nSSC\n\nroutine\n\nwhich\n\nif the\n\nimages\n\nFinal\n\nReport\n\nmimicked\nmade\n\n18\n\nhow the GHRS\n\nsense\n\nfor a given\n\nmakes\n\nan image\n\nset of telescope\n\nof the field of the SSA to test\n\npointings.\n\nThis\n\nprogram\n\ntook\n\na\n\nmodel of the field of view, including all of the Weigelt number stars (R136al-8),\nused\nthe SSA dimensions\nto cut off light which does not enter into the GHRS, convolved\nthe light which does get through the SSA with an assumed GHRS instrumental\nprofile,\nand formed an SSA image sampled in the same way as the images obtained\nas part of\nthe ERO program.\nThere were four free parameters,\nthe center of the SSA in X and\nY with respect to the field of view for the first image, which fixed the positions for the\nnext two images, and the center of the image in X and Y with respect\nto the center\nof the SSA. Using this program,\nMalumuth\nfound good agreement\nwith the observed\nimage for a position where R136al was in the center of the SSA in Y and two deflection\nsteps\n\nfrom\n\nthe center\n\nin X, and the images\n\ncenters\n\nwere three\n\ndeflection\n\nsteps\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\ncenter of the SSA in X and five in Y. This position put the peak of R136a2 on the edge\nof the SSA, not within the SSA as planned.\nBecause of this, when the telescope\nwas\nmaneuvered\nto the R136a2 position, about one-third\nof the light was still from R136al.\nR136a5\nR136a7\n\nwas near the center\nas desired.\n\nMalumuth\ngram.\n\nexamined\n\nHe corrected\n\nof the SSA, which\n\nthe WFPC2\n\nthe few pixels\n\nimages\nthat\n\ndid exclude\n\nthe light\n\nobtained\n\nas part\n\nwere saturated\n\nin the\n\nof the\n\nfrom\n\nR136a2\n\nR136a\n\n20-second\n\nand\n\nERO\n\npro-\n\nexposure\n\nand\n\ncombined\nit with the 10-second and 5-second exposures\nto form a single PC image of\n30 Dor. R136a was near the center of this chip. Malumuth\nused his MPHOT\nprogram\nto do photometry\nof over 1000 stars in this field of view. He then matched\nthe results\nwith the results of the WFPC1\nU and B photometry\nobtained\nearlier and published\nin\nMalumuth\n& Heap (1994). The first result was that a few stars as bright as U = 15\nmag which appear on the PC2 image were missed in the PC1 photometry.\nOn the B\nimage there were 22 stars between U = 15 and U = 17 mag which were missed. These\nstars\nleast\n\nwere overwhelmingly\n1 magnitude\nbrighter.\n\nbetween 0.1 and 0.2 arcseconds\nOnly a few stars were less than\n\nfrom a star which was at\n0.1 arcseconds\nfrom a star\n\nbrighter\nby more than 1 mag. This demonstrated\nthat not only had the wings been\nbrought in by the corrective\noptics, but that the resolution\nwas better with the WFPC2\nthan with the WFPC1.\nMalumuth\nalso found that the scatter was larger in comparing\nWFPC1\nU photometry\nto WFPC2\nU photometry\nthan it was comparing\nthe WFPC1\nB photometry\nto the WFPC2 U photometry,\ndespite the true color differences\nbetween\nthe stars. This showed quantitatively,\nas suspected,\nthat the B image taken with Heap\'s\nGTO time was much better than\nObservation\n(SAO) program.\nMalumuth\nmass functions\nthe same\n\nthe U image\n\nused the new U band photometry\n(IMFs)\nboth within R136a and\n\nas those\n\nin Malumuth\n\n_z Heap\n\n(1994).\n\ntaken\n\nas part\n\nof the Science\n\nAssessment\n\nto examine\nthe luminosity\nand initial\noutside R136a.\nThe conclusions\nwere\nThe\n\nluminosity\n\nfunction\n\nand the\n\nwere both flatter\nwithin R136a.\nMalumuth\nalso created\na color-magnitude\n(CMD) using the new U band and old B band photometry.\nThis CMD showed\nrelation\nthan was obtained\nbefore.\nThis was due to the improvement\nin the\nphotometry\nover the old SAO WFPC1 data.

The median image was then\nused to remove cosmic-ray\nevents from each image, and a final co-added\nimage was\nformed for each filter. Malumuth\nthen used the F439W, F547M, and FS14W (B, V,\nand I) images to make a true color image of the field.

Finally, using the mass-luminosity\nrelation,\nhe determined\nthe initial mass of all of the stars more massive than about 10 solar masses.\nThis IMF, uncorrected\nfor the presence of background\nstars, had a slope of -2.24, much\nsteeper\nthan that found for NGC 595.

By careful analysis of the lines Robinson\ndiscovered\n\nthat the wings had a relatively\n\nsmall radial\n\nvelocity\n\nwith respect\n\nto the stellar\n\nrest frame, with most stars showing a slight inflow. However, the absorption\nfeatures\nshowed a blue shift which increased with the relative strength\nof the line. This behavior\nindicated\nan acceleration\nof the wind with height through\nthe chromospheric\nregions\nwhere these Fe II lines are formed. This acceleration\nwas also seen in other lines, such\nas the Mg II and\n\nO I resonance\n\nlines, which\n\nare formed\n\nat higher\n\nlayers\n\nthan\n\nthe\n\nFe II\n\nlines. Of the four stars examined\nin detail, Robinson\nfound that the wind signature\nwas greatest\nfor the M giant 7 Cru. In this star the wind appears\nto originate\nlow in\nthe atmosphere\nand accelerates\nto values of about 15 km s -l in the regions sampled\nby the strongest\nFen\nlines. In contrast,\nthe K giant a Tau shows no evidence for a\nwind\n\nexcept\n\nin the very strongest\n\nFe I1 lines.\n\nIn this star\n\nthe wind\n\nsignature\n\nis mainly\n\nseen in the O I and lVIg II line profiles, suggesting\nthat the acceleration\nis initiated\nat relatively\nlarge heights in the atmosphere.\nRobinson\nis currently\nworking with the\nTLUSTY\ncode, developed\nby Hubeny, to develop realistic atmospheric\nmodels for these\nstars and to quantitatively\ndetermine\nthe wind as a function of height.\nIt is normally\nby small\ncompared\nspectrum\n\nassumed\n\nthat\n\namounts,\nif at all.\nan HSTspectrum\ntaken\n\nin 1990, they\n\nthe height\n\nthe mass-loss\n\nof wind\n\nonset\n\nrate from these\n\nand\n\nthe acceleration\n\ncool, luminous\n\nstars\n\nof\n\nvaries\n\nHowever, when Robinson,\nCarpenter,\nand Mullan (Bartol)\nof the K supergiant\nA Vel taken in 1994 with a similar IUE\nfound\n\nsubstantial\n\nchanges\n\nin the Fe II line profiles.\n\nWhile\n\nthe HST observations\nshowed normal, centrally\nreversed Fe 11 lines with a slight excess\nin the intensity\nof the red peak, the IUEdata\nhad Fe II lines in which the blue portion\nof the profile was almost completely\ngone.

The profile changes\nwere seen at a velocity\nof 100 km s -1 from line center, which suggested\nthat the star has a much larger wind\nterminal\nvelocity than had previously\nbeen suspected.\nIn fact, a close examination\nof\nthe\n\nMg II line by Robinson\n\nand\n\nMullan\n\nshowed\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nactual\n\nterminal\n\nvelocity\n\nis\n\nprobably\ncloser to 280 km s -1. Robinson has examined\nthe Mg 1I profiles for a large\nrange of cool, luminous stars and showed that a large wind terminal\nvelocity may, in\nfact, be a common characteristic\nof this class of star.\nRobinson and Carpenter\ninvestigated\nchromospheric\nmacroturbulence\nusing the profiles of optically\nthin emission lines, such as the C If] and Si II] intercombination\nlines\nand fluorescent\nlines of Fe I and Fe II. The turbulence\nwas found to increase with stellar\nluminosity,\n\ngoing\n\nfrom\n\n24-27\n\nkm s -1 for the K and M giants\n\nto 34-37\n\nkm s -I\n\nin the\n\nK-M supergiants.\nThe profiles were also found to have large wings, which Robinson\nand\nCarpenter\nhave interpreted\nas being caused by an anisotropic\ndistribution\nof velocities,\nsuch that the turbulence\nis preferentially\ndirected either parallel or perpendicular\nto the\nstellar radius.\nThe large turbulent\ning of the atmosphere\n\nvelocities are highly supersonic\nand may give clues to the heatand the mechanisms\nwhich drive the stellar wind. Robinson and\n\nCarpenter\nworked with P. Judge (HAO) and M. Cuntz (CASA) on observations\naimed\nat determining\nwhether\nstochastic\nacoustic shocks may be responsible\nfor the observed\nmacroturbulence.\nAccording to ab-initio calculations\nwill interact\nwith one another and cause substantial\non time scales\n\nof hours\n\nto days.\n\nHowever,\n\nexamination\n\ncarried out by Cuntz, these shocks\nvariations\nin the local turbulence\nof C II profiles\n\non _ Tau\n\nwhich\n\nwere taken approximately\n12 hours apart shows no indication\nof measurable\nchanges in\nthe profiles. Further,\nmost of the shock calculations\npredict turbulent\nvelocities\nwhich\nare substantially\nsmaller than those observed.\nAirapetian\nand Robinson\nhave therefore\nbeen examining\nan alternative\ntheory which involves non-linear\nAlf_en waves. Theories which have used linear Alf_en waves to explain chromospheric\nheating\nand wind\nacceleration\nhave been around since the mid 1980s. However, they have generally\ninvolved highly non-realistic\nassumptions.\nRecently,\nL. Ofman\n(HSTX)\nand J. Davila\n(GSFC) have been investigating\nthe behavior of these waves in solar coronal holes using\na fully consistent\nthree-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamics\ncode. This code indicates\nthat waves generated\nby the stellar convection\nmotions in the photosphere\ncan steepen\nas they propagate\nupwards\nand will eventually\nbecome non-linear.\nAt some point the\nvelocity shears will become sufficiently\nlarge so that Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities\nare\ninitiated\nand\ndamp through\n\nlarge amounts\nof magnetic\nviscous or ohmic processes\n\nturbulence\nare formed.\nto heat the atmosphere\n\nThis turbulence\ncan\nand may also transfer\n\nmomentum\nwhich will drive a wind.

However, extrapolating\nthis\nrelationship\nto lower energies predicted\nfar too few events to account for the observed\nbackground\nNUV emission,\nespecially\nin the case of YZ CMi. Thus, it was concluded\nthat either microflares\nare not the source of chromospheric\nand coronal heating or that\nthe occurrence\nrate for the microflares\nincreases by an order of magnitude\nor more at\nthe smallest\n\nenergies.\n\nRobinson and Airapetian\nalso collaborated\nwith Woodgate\nand Carpenter\non a large\ncoordinated\nobserving\ncampaign\nof the dMe flare star YZ CMi, carried out in December 1994.\n\nThis campaign\n\nwas built around\n\nWoodgate\'s\n\nGHRS\n\nGO observations\n\nstar, which were designed to follow up an earlier detection\nof proton beams\nimpulsive\nphase of a flare on AU Mic.

It was found that the temperature\nand density derived from the\nCO and C I profiles are dependent\nupon the fraction of para- and ortho-molecular\nH2\npresent,\n\nsince these\n\ntwo forms\n\nof H2 have different\n\nexcitation\n\ncross-sections\n\nfor CO and\n\nC I.
