b"Light Controller\nArtificial lighting is designed to\nprovide the light intensity necessary if\nthere were no other source of illumination. But many rooms, particularly\nthose in large-windowed office\nbuildings, get a substantial amount of\nsunlight during the day. An automatic\nsystem which considers available sunlight and adjusts the artificial lighting\nlevel accordingly can trim energy\ncosts appreciably. Such a system was\ndeveloped by NASA's Kennedy Space\nCenter. International Technology\nCorporation, Satellite Beach, Florida,\nobtained a NASA patent license for\nthe technology, refined the design,\nand is now producing commercially\nan improved version known as the\nAutomatic Lighting Controller.\nIn the photo, the small wall-mounted\ndevice at upper left is a photocell\nsensor which measures the intensity\nof combined sunlight and artificial\nlight. The sensor communicates its information to the light controller in the\nbox at left of the typewriter (the unit\nshown is a display model; normally\nthe control box would be centrally located and out of sight). The controller\nautomatically switches lights in various parts of the room to maintain a\npredetermined lighting level. The\nthird element of the system, on the\nwall below the sensor, is the switch\nwhich turns the system on; by removing the switchplate, the user can\nadjust lighting intensity to his desired\nlevel. According to the manufacturer,\nuse of the light controller can, in\nsome cases, reduce electrical usage\nby 90 percent on a given day.\n\na\n\nThe system's capability was demonstrated in a two-year NASA test program and the Automatic Lighting\nController is being further evaluated\nby the National Bureau of Standards\n(NBS). Under NBS contract, International Technology Corporation\ninstalled the system at the Bureau's\nCenter for Building Technology,\nGaithersburg, Maryland.\n\n"
