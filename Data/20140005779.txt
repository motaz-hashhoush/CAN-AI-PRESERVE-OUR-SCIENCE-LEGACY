b"NASA funding opportunities for optical fabrication and testing\ntechnology development\nH. Philip Stahl\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center, AL 35812\nH.Philip.Stahl@nasa.gov\nABSTRACT\nTechnologies to fabricate and test optical components are required for NASA to accomplish its highest\npriority science missions. For example, the NRC ASTRO2010 Decadal Survey states that an advanced\nlarge-aperture UVOIR telescope is required to enable the next generation of compelling astrophysics and\nexo-planet science; and that present technology is not mature enough to affordably build and launch any\npotential UVOIR mission concept. The NRC 2012 NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities\nreport states that the highest priority technology in which NASA should invest to \xe2\x80\x98Expand our\nunderstanding of Earth and the universe\xe2\x80\x99 is a new generation of astronomical telescopes. And, each of the\nAstrophysics division Program Office Annual Technology Reports (PATR), identifies specific technology\nneeds. NASA has a variety of programs to fund enabling technology development: SBIR (Small Business\nInnovative Research); the ROSES APRA and SAT programs (Research Opportunities in Space and Earth\nScience; Astrophysics Research and Analysis program; Strategic Astrophysics Technology program); and\nseveral Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) technology development programs.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\nDr. H. Philip Stahl is a Senior Optical Physicist at NASA MSFC currently\nleading an effort to mature technologies for a new large aperture telescope to\nreplace Hubble. Previous assignments include Astrophysics Division Deputy\nAssistant Director for Technology and Mirror Technology lead for the James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST). Dr. Stahl co-authored two NASA\ntechnology studies: Office of Chief Technologist Science Instruments,\nObservatories and Sensor Systems Technology Assessment (2011); and\nAdvance Planning and Integration Office Advanced Telescope and\nObservatory Capability Roadmap (2005). Additionally, he is the originator of\nthe annual \xe2\x80\x9cMirror Technology Days in the Government\xe2\x80\x9d workshops. Dr.\nStahl is a leading authority in optical metrology, optical engineering, and\nphase-measuring interferometry. Many of the world's largest telescopes have\nbeen fabricated with the aid of high-speed and infrared phase-measuring\nInterferometers developed by him, including the Keck, VLT and Gemini\ntelescopes. At Raytheon Danbury he was lead optical engineer for the 4\nmeter LAMP mirror and the Spitzer secondary mirror. Dr. Stahl is a member of OSA and SPIE (Fellow)\nand 2013 SPIE President-Elect. He is a past ICO Vice President. He earned his PhD in Optical Science at\nthe University of Arizona Optical Sciences Center in 1985.\n\n"
