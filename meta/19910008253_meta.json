The development of these methods directly supports the NASA mission of increasing the scope and effectiveness of flight system modeling capabilities. The conventional, continuous mathematics that is used extensively in modeling flight systems is not adequate for accurate modeling of digital systems. Therefore, the current practice of digital flight control system design has not had the benefits of extensive mathematical modeling which are common in other parts of flight system engineering. Formal methods research shows that by using discrete mathematics, very accurate modeling of digital systems is possible. These discrete modeling methods will bring the traditional benefits of modeling to digital hardware and hardware design. Sound reasoning about accurate mathematical models of flight control systems can be an important part of reducing risk of unsafe flight control.", "title": "What can formal methods offer to digital flight control systems design", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910008253, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Good, Donald I."}, "organization": {"name": "Computational Logic, Inc.", "location": "Austin, TX, United States"}}, "id": "9991b7f4273c43fda61a8938ea4eb990"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910008253, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910008253, "id": "f1996e2dd0734ed08e5a1c6e6dd7e079", "publicationName": "NASA, Langley Research Center, NASA Formal Methods Workshop, 1990", "publicationDate": "1990-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910008253.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910008253/downloads/19910008253.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910008253/downloads/19910008253.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910008253/downloads/19910008253.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
