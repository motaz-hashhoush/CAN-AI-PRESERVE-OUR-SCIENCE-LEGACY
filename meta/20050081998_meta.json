Here an explicit solution to the equations giving the bounded rationality equilibrium of a game is presented. Then PC is used to investigate games in which the players use bounded rational best-response strategies. Next it is shown that in the continuum-time limit, bounded rational best response games result in a variant of the replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory. It is then shown that for team (shared-payoff) games, this variant of replicator dynamics is identical to Newton-Raphson iterative optimization of the shared utility function.", "title": "What Information Theory Says about Bounded Rational Best Response", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T11:57:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050081998, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wolpert, David H."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "d898f89362be483aaf3011b701758a1f"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050081998, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050081998, "id": "ad65521b73ec45bcbb58c5b93387919d", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050081998.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050081998/downloads/20050081998.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050081998/downloads/20050081998.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050081998/downloads/20050081998.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
