Parametric variations of aircraft and propeller characteristics were investigated to determine their effects on noiseprint areas, fuel consumption, and direct operating costs. From these results, three aircraft designs were selected and subjected to design refinements and sensitivity analyses. Three competitive turbofan aircraft were also defined from parametric studies to provide a basis for comparing the two types of propulsion.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820008197, "id": "607a2916197d4fc2a8bdb30781c02215", "publicationDate": "1981-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19820008197.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19820008197/downloads/19820008197.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19820008197/downloads/19820008197.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19820008197/downloads/19820008197.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
