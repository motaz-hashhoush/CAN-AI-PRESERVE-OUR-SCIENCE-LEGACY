A b s t r a c t\n\nA tunable birefringent filter using the alternate partial polarizer (APP) design of Title has been built. The filter has a transmissiori of 38$ in polarized light. Its full width at half maximum\nis .09A at 5500A. It is tunable from 4500-8500A by means of steppin\nmotor actuated rotating half wave plates and polarizers. Wave length\ncommands and thermal compensation comands are generated by a\nPPD 1 / 0 mini computer.\n11\nIn Section I the Lockheed Alternate Partial Polarizer Universal\nFilter is compared with the Zeis Universal Birefringent Filter. In\nSections II, III and IV the design, techniques, construction methods\nand filter performance are discussed in some detail.

This report consists of three major\nparts - design, construction methods, and performance, with an introduction <,\nand conclusion.\n\nThe introduction is a general view of the features of the\n\nfilter as a whole while the conclusion contains directions for future research\nusing this design as a base.\n\nPrevious to the Lockheed Alternate Partial Polarizer Universal Filter\n(LAPPU), one other universal birefringent design has been built by the Zeiss\nCorporation.\n\nOur filter differs in several significant ways from the Zeiss\n\ndesign. First, the fundamental requirement for a tuneable filter is acromatic\nhalf and quarter waveplates. Zeiss, following the design of Jacques Beckers\' \',\nbuilt waveplates using two materials with opposite retardation change with wavelength.\n\nThe LAPPU uses achromatic waveplates made of sheets stretched polyvinyl\n\nalcohol(FVA) oriented in such a manner as to achieve achromatic retardation.\nThe plastic waveplates are considerably less sensitive to wavelength variation\nthan the crystal waveplates.\n\nThey are also considerably cheaper to fabricate.\n;\n\n(They can be fabricated in large sizes. Aim\n\ndiameter waveplate is not un-\n\nreasonable.) The waveplate materials are described in "Improvement of Birefringent\n2\nFilters, I-Reduction of Scatter in Polaroid Materials." This article describes\nthe fabrication techniques for both low scatter polarizer and waveplate material.\nThe design of achromatic waveplates is described in "Improvement of Birefringent\nFilters,II^Achromatic Waveplates."\n\nThis article describes the theory of\n\nmulti-element achromatic waveplates.\n\n"Improvements in Birefringent Filters,\n\nIII. Errors in Wide field Elements,"\n\ndiscusses the effect of departures from\n\nperfection of the multi-element waveplates and their impact on wide field\nelement transmission.\n\nA second major difference between the Zeiss filter and the LAPPU is\nin the crystal element length ratios and use of partial polarizers. All previous Lyot-Ohmon type birefringent filters have used length\nL, L/2, Ii/^-, ... L/2 , with high (10\n\nratios of the form\n\n- 10 ) transmission to rejection polarizers.\n\nThe LAPPU uses length ratios L, L/2, L/3, L/6, L/9, L/18, ... . Between elements\nwith 2:1 length ratios, a polarizer with 3$ leakage is used.\n\nPreviously,\n\nGiovanelli; and Jefferies, and Beckers and Dunn have theoretically discussed\nthe effect of partial polarizers.\npolarizers had been built.\n\nHowever, no successful filter with partial\n\n"The Effect of Partial Polaroids in Birefringent\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n7\n\nFilters-"\n\ndiscusses how a single partial polarizer effects the design of a\n\nbirefringent filter.\n\nA detailed description of the design theory for general\n\ncrystal lengths will be written for the fifth paper in the Improvement of Birefringent Filters series. The design section describes the rational behind and\nthe characteristics of the L, L/2> L/3, L/6, L/9, L/18,- L/27, L/54- design used\nfor LAPPU.\n\nA third difference between the Zeiss and the LAPPU is the tuning method\nused. The Zeiss uses a single 1/U- waveplate on each element which allows the\nelement to be tuned by rotation of a polaroid.\n\nHowever, the rotating polaroid\n\nis the entrance polaroid for the next crystal element and as such must be at\n\n4-5 to the crystal fast axis. Hence, all crystals after the first must rotate.\nIn the LKPFU, an additional achromatic half waveplate is used with every other\nelement with this system, it is necessary to only rotate half waveplates and\npolarizers.\n\nIn our opinion, there is significant advantage to not rotating crystals.\nBecause of difficulties in fabrication, the field of view of elements is not\nexactly coincident and the axes of the elements. The axis also may not be\nco-linear. (When resolution of a fraction of an arc second is required from\ndifference pairs very small image distortions become important.) We have examined\nthe Zeiss universal owned by Dr. Zirin and have found significant field and\naxis effects. The Zeiss tunable Ha filter owned by Kitt Peak National -Observatory\nshows similar effects. The effect of angular misalignment will be discussed\nin paper four of the Improvement series.\n\nA fourth area of difference between the Zeiss and the LAPPU is in the\narea of tuning and thermal control.\n\nThe Zeiss stores a set of polarizer and\n\nelement positions for 20 lines in a diode matrix and tunes mechanically from\nthese lines.\n\nThe Sacramento Peak Zeiss has been modified to run directly from\n\na 27 computer. The LAPPU also runs under control of a computer, in this case,\na EDP11/10, which contains wavelength command programs. The tuning polarizers\nand half waveplates are run by eight independent stepping motors. There is\nno mechanical linkage between individual tuners. The design is completely\nmodular, each element and its tuning control can be removed independent of\nthe rest of the filter.\n\nThe thermal control of the Zeiss has a main thermal shroud controller\nand individual temperature controllers for each element.\n\nThe stepping motors\n\nwhich are high heat output devices are mounted inside the thermal shroud which\nplaces large demands on the thermal control system. The LAPPU has temperature\nsensors mounted directly on each crystal.\n\nThe computer can use this information\n\nto compensate the tuning for any temperature change. The filter is mounted\nin a substantial mass of aluminum and all the elements are in a common oil bath\nso that there is a considerable thermal inertia.\n\nII.\n\nDESIGN\n\nA.\n\nOptical\nThe design chosen for the filter is non-traditional in that successive\n\nelements are not a factor two shorter as in the standard Lyot design.\n\nRather,\n\nsuccessive pairs have lengths such that the sum of the lengths of the shorter\n\xe2\x80\xa2\npair is equal to the shorter element of the longer pair. Members of a pair have the\ntraditional T2 to 1 length ratios.\nlengths L, L/2, L/3, L/6.\n\nThat is, the first four elements have\n\nThe advantage of these length ratios is that the\n\npolarizers\' between elements that differ by a factor of 2 may have a transmission\nto rejection ratio ;on the order of 10X., Since, for dichroic polarizers, the\ntransmission in the pass direction decreases with the rejection to transmission\nratio, the use of "poor" polarizers increases total transmission.\n\nFor this\n\nfilter there are four partial polarizers -- each with a transmission of .92.\nThese replace polarizers of .8*4- transmission.\n\nAs a result, the transmission\n\nis increased by a factor of ( 9 / 8 ) = 1.44.\n.2.^\n\nAn additional advantage of\n\nthe design is that the need for a contrast element is eliminated? since the\naction of the partial polarizers is to internally self apodize the transmission.\n\nThe basic ideas of the design technique are discussed in "Partial\nPolaroids in Birefringent Filters."\n\nThe fifth member of the Improvement of\n\nBirefringent Filters paper will describe the design techniques for general\ncrystal lengths and general polarizers.\n\nThe only disadvantage of the partial polarizer design is that dichoric\npolarizers that are readily available have., an insufficient polarization below\nf\n\n4-500A. However, with the design used here they can be readily replaced with\n\nproper polarizers.,-- \xe2\x80\xa2which we hope to do in the not too distant\nfuture.\n\nThe filter actually constructed has crystal lengths of L, L/2, L/3,\nL/6, L/9, L/18, L/27, L/5^, where L is 7 9 8 ! cm. The total length of\n.26\ncalcite is 17.912cm. Shown in Table 1 is the full width at half maximum\n(FWHM), the fraction of light inside FWHM, the fraction outside 2 x FWHM,\nand ik\'x FWHMy\'.the \'transmission of the filter at transmission maximum in\npolarized light, and epsilon, the partial polarizer factor.\n\nEpsilon is\n\ndefined:\ne =AH/(Ap - A^\nwhere A,, is the transmission amplitude in the rejection direction and A^\nis the transmission amplitude in the pass direction.\n\nThe data for Table 1 was computed using LYTJ, a computer program for general\ncombinations of retardation plates, rotators, waveplates, and partial polarizers.\nn\n\nThe input to the program was the actual configuration of the LAPHJ, Beckers\'\nanalytic expression for calcite index difference and the measured performance\nof the actual polarizers used in the filter.\n\nShown in Figures 1 through 6 is the transmission and contribution function of the filter to the free spectral range for the six wavelengths of Table 1.\nThe contribution function (shown dotted) is the fraction of the light outside\nthe wavelength" to half the free spectral range..

Here the field\ndiameter changes will be illustrated. Shown in Figures 7-12\n\nare computer\n\nsimulated fringe patterns for a wide field element diffusely illuminated by a\nmonochromatic\n\nsource for half waveplates rotated by various amounts.\n\nThe\n\nfigures show the fringe patterns of the wide field elements, the patterns\nevolving from circular patterns, superimposed on a double hyperbolic pattern\ncharacteristic of narrow field elements.\n\nThis representation is used because\n\nif the half waveplate is not /perfect, faint hyperbolic fringes\nwill be visible/ Even if the waveplate is perfect on axis at some point off\naxis the hyperbolic fringes become visible.\n\nFrom Figures 7 through 12 it is clear that an angular orientation of\nbetter than 0.1 radian ( 5 \xc2\xb0 is desirable and that the field of view is cut\n.7)\nby a factor of two when the rotation error is .05 radians (2.87 ).\n\nThe other important feature of the alignment of wide field elements\nis the relative tilt of the two crystals of the wide field element.\n\n8\n\nShown in\n\nFigures 13, 14, 15 and 16 are fringe patterns for several tilts.\n\nThe important\n\nresult here is that elements can be properly aligned by comparison of the\nhyperbolic and circular fringes. For calcite, the relative displacement of\nthe circular fringes is 10 times the displacement of the hyperbolic fringes,\nso that the construction technique is to center the circular fringes on the\nhyperbolic fringes by proper element tilt.\n\nFor a filter of 0.1A at 5000A, a resolution of 5 x 10 , the angular field\n-3\ncorresponding to a shift of . 1A is about 5 x 10 radians, the angular alignment\nof the two halves of the wide field element must be at least a factor of 10\nbetter than this.\n\nA more reasonable requirement is a factor of 50. Hence,\n\nthe axial tilt alignment is on the order of 10\nexercised to achieve such alignment.\n\nradians.\n\nGreat care must be\n\nKeying techniques such as used by Zeiss\n\nor hexagonal prisms used by Halle are not sufficient to achieve such alignment.\n\nBecause of the alignment requirements, the design used here does not\nrotate any crystal elements.\ning of quarter waveplate,\n\nRather, the filter consists of four modules consist-\n\ncrystal of the length L, half wave, crystal of length\n\nL, partial polarizer, crystal of length L/2, half wave, crystal of length L/2,\nand a final quarter wave. The elements are tuned by a separate assembly of a\nrotating polarizer and half waveplate.\n\nIII.\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nA.\n\nFilter System\nThis section will illustrate the construction features of the LAPRJ.\n\nShown in Figure 17 are the eight wide field modules with temperature sensors\nattached. These modules are connected together in pairs and then mounted between the tuning assemblies.\nassemblies.\n\nFigure 18 shows the crystal modules and tuning\n\nFigure 19 shows the gear drives for the elements installed, and\n\nFigure 20 shows the complete optical-mechanical assembly of the filter.\n\nThe\n\nentire housing shown in Figure 20 is filled with index matching fluid with\nan index of 1.52.\n\nThe drive shafts to the rotating components are oil sealed.\n\nSeen on the top of the housing is the connector to the thermal sensors.\n\nShown in Figure 21 is the framework for mounting the eight stepping\nmotors.\n\nFigure 22 shows the motors installed and wired. Figure 22 then re-\n\npresents the complete electro-optical assembly.\n\nThe electro-optical assembly\n\nis electrically connected to motor controller drives, the thermal sensor multiplexer,\n\nand\n\nthe zero position status logic. All of these are mounted on\n\nthe interface chassis shown in Figure 23.\n\nA flow chart for the interface chassis is shown in Figure 24-. Fundamentally, the purpose of the chassis is to connect the PDP11/10 control computer with\nthe thermal sensors, stepping motors of the filter, and zero position sensors\nof the motors.\n\nThe thermal sensors are connected to the computer through a A/D\n\nconverter and a multiplex switch. A schematic of the input-output control\nlines\n\nis shown in Figure 25.\n\n10\n\nShown in Table II is the detailed list of the optical train in\nthe order light strikes them. Table III lists the sub-structure of the\npolarizers, partial polarizers, and waveplates. Table IV contains a\nlist of filter material, cements, and oils. Shown in Figure 26 is an\nexploded view of a single module together with a schematic of its position\nin the filter.

It should "be recognized that our polishing methods,\nalthough successful for our universal filter, are not necessarily superior\nto that used by experienced commercial optical craftsmen. .Recent commercial calcite elements which we have tested are generally equal in quality to ours\nand in some cases slightly superior.\n\nThe processes used to produce such\n\ncrystals is necessarily propriatary to commercial makers, and so "by describing\nour methods we can perhaps provide information not presently available in\nthe literature.\n\nIn any birefringent filter design, whether it be the earlier Lyot-Ohman\nor the partial-Polarpid design, all calcite,elements must be _\nworked to final very precise thickness ratios.\nscratch in final polishing can be disastrous.\n\nThis means that a deep\nCalcite has the disposition of\n\nnot just scratching, but fracturing, sometimes in excess of a millimeter deep.\nFor this reason, our method had to be one which minimized this danger.\n\nWe believe that deep scratching is produced by calcite particles from\nrough unfinished outer edges. For this reason we prepared elements for\npolish by first grinding them on an Aluminum Oxide wheel to smooth cylinders\nand then fine grinding the sharp edges of the circular aperture to produce\na smooth chamfer well below expected polishing depth.\n\nFor our thickest elements, the calcite crystals were not large\nenough or sufficiently homogeneous to afford the luxury of polishing and\nthen later diaphraming or grinding to smaller aperture to eliminate bad\nfiltering by edge turn-down.\n\nWe found it necessary to find a polishing\n\ntechnique which produced minimum edge turn-down to preserve our final\nfilter aperture of 33 mm.\n\nIn essence our method was one in final polishing of working crystals with\n\xe2\x80\xa2concave surfaces and slowly decreasing the surface curvature, starting with a\nlap properly convex, several fringes, and finishing with gulap-almo.st flat.\n\nThe convex lap will accelerate early polish of the calcite, centrally\nsupported in its holder. It. was noted that polishing in the concave to flat direction produced negligible edge turn on our calcite and pronounced edge-turn at the\nhole-edge in the holder.\n\nWe found that if by chance it was necessary to\n\npolish in the direction from convex to flat, that this produced the reciprocal\ncondition of pronounced edge-turn on the calcite with negligible edge-turn\non the holder-hole.\n\nThis may possibly be a well documented technique but\n\nwe feel it is worth describing our experience.\n\nFor polishing we found "Linde A" recommended by R. Dunn to be the\nmost satisfactory of all tested. Our polishing laps were made\nfrom 80 percent Burgundy Pitch and 20 percent Beeswax. They were 15 cm\n\n\\\n\nin diameter with facets 10 mm square. Our work was supported in white\nmarble holders 7.6 cm in diameter with a supporting hole .25 mm oversize. The\n\n18\n\nholder and calcite element were pressed to a glass flat covered with a thin layer\nof silicone grease.\n\nBurgundy pitch was flowed into the ^25 ram space at- an\n\noven temperature of 190 C. It is absolutely essential to avoid "thermal\nshock" to the calcite by raising oven temperature slowly, and then cooling\nthe work completely to room temperature before sliding the work off the supporting\nglass plate.\n\nAfter polishing, to remove the calcite from the holder, the work\nis again pressed with silicone grease to glass, and slowly heated to;175\xc2\xb0C.\nAt this point heavy insulated pot holders must be used to avoid any "thermal\nshock" to the calcite in extracting it from the holder.\n\nAt such elevated\n\ntemperature, inadvertently touching the calcite with the exposed hand\nwill fracture it.\n\nThere may be supoorting materials superior to pitch available\ncommercially which would eliminate this dangerous temperature excursion in mounting, but in our experience we did not find any.\n\nBeeswax, although lower\n\ntemperature melting, did not support the work properly.\n\nFor thinner elements to provide increased support we used silicone\ngrease to add thicker clear glass cylinders to the crystal. For all elements\nthinner than the holder, this was done to permit safe excess pitch removal\nand allow clear viewing of hyperbolic fringes through the calcite during\nthe polishing process.\n\n19\n\nWith the method briefly described, we produced flat, scratch-free,\nwell polished, parallel surfaces with negligible edge-turn. For most of\nthe elements this was sufficient.\n\nHowever, for the thickest elements it\n\nwas necessary to do some local figuring to compensate for minor calcite\ninhomogeneities.\n\nLocal figuring was easier and more successful when done\n\nwith the element still supported in it1s marble holder.\n\nWe found that\n\nhoneycomb beeswax laps supported on small flat tools dipped in a thin\npaste of "Linde A" provided scratch-free means of figuring small areas with\ngood control.\n\nGreat care must be taken not to exceed the corrective figuring\n\nrequired, and you must allow local heating produced in polishing to completely\nstabilize when assessing the progress of corrective polish.\n\nThrough the entire polishing operation besides monitoring the\nflatness of the surface figure, we also observed parallelism;by watching the hyperbolic fringes produced between polaroids in monochromatic light (in our case,^\na Helium source). Especially in doing local figuring, it is important to\ndetermine unambiguously whether an area is thick or thin. This was best done\nby warming the spot with a finger and observing the change in the hyperbolic\nfringes.\n\nIncreasing temperature will move the fringes in a direction corres-\n\nponding to a thinner element. This, of course, is because the difference in\ncalcite indices decreases and the element decreases in length with temperature\nincrease (it increases in diameter though).\n\nA final precaution in handling, cleaning, and assembling or disassembling finished calcite elements.\n\nThe surfaces are extremely vunerable\n\nto abrasion, and will scratch or pit with even the most cautious treatment.\nGreat care must be taken to omit any foreign particles in assembly with\nother surfaces.\n\nSuch particles can do great damage especialy in later dis-\n\nassembly, sliding elements apart.\n\n21\n\nIV.\n\nPERFORMANCES\n\nA.\n\nTransmission\n\n^\n\nThe theoretical transmission of the LAPPU using the measured value of\npolarizer transmission was presented in design section. These results are shown\nin Table I. Not included in the calculation was the fresnel reflection loss\nat each calcite to oil interface. There are 32 such interfaces, each with a\nloss factor of .001.\n\nThe transmission reduction from this effect is .968.\n\nIn addition the filter can lose transmission due to scatter, index mismatches\nat plastic and glass interfaces, and several types of misalignment.\n\nSo\n\nthat the calcite index mismatch corrected transmission is a best case upper\nlimit upon the filters1 transmission.\n\nThe filters transmission has been carefully measured at X 6328. At this\nwavelength the corrected theoretical transmission is .^36.\ntransmission was .35.\n\nThe measured\n\nHowever, at the time of measurement the filter did not\n\nhave A-R coated entrance and exit surfaces.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of\n\nthese coatings the measured transmission is increased "by a fresnel factor of\n1.091 for a corrected transmission of .38.\n\nThe operational transmission of\n\nthe system is thus 0.88 of the maximum theoretical estimate. The Zeiss Universal, by comparison, has a transmission of 0.07 at ^ 6328 and a FWHM of 0.22.\n\nThe filter measurement was made by monitoring the filter\' s transmission\nof a collimated He-Ne laser beam while each tuning component was rotated to\nachieve maximum transmission.\n\nThe rotation sequencing and the settings to opti-\n\nmized positions was done by program SPIN. The laser beam was sampled both in\nfront of and behind the filter to remove laser intensity fluctuations. When\nthe transmission of the filter was maximized, the filter was removed from\n\n22\n\nthe beam. The ratio of the intensities with the filter in and out of the\nbeam is the measured transmission factor.\n\nAccurate transmission measurements are difficult to perform on our\nspectrograph which has a theoretical resolution of 0.02A at X 6328.\nPrecision measurements shall be carried out in Feb. 1976 at Kitt Peak\nusing the 10 meter spectrograph.\n\nMeasurements of the filter transmission\n\nwhich have been made at Lockheed that show a FWHM that is consistently larger\nby .02A than predicted (see Table I). However, the experimental measurements are consistent with the combination of the theoretical FWHM and\nspectrograph resolution, shown in Figures 27, 28 and 29.\n\n23\n\nB.\n\nComputer Control\nThe filter\'s computer control currently operates by driving the polar-\n\nizers and waveplates to a set of position angles corresponding to the desired\nwavelength.\n\nTuning near a set wavelength is accomplished by rotating wave-\n\nplates and polarizers to angles that are proportional to the crystal lengths.\nBecause the position of the waveplates and polarizers interact, a simple\ncalculation is done for each tuning element. Currently the filter can be\ndriven to any set wavelength in the visible and tuned plus or minus sixteen\nangstroms with essentially the same line profile.\n\nAt any wavelength tempera-\n\nture compensation is done by sensing the individual thermistors and tuning\nthe elements using an assumed wavelength shift with temperature.\n\nFor manual checks each tuner can be cycled directly from the computer\ncontrol console. The temperature of all the crystals can be printed on the\nteletype either once or every 10 seconds by a key command.\n\nIn addition to the wavelength setting and tuning programs, there are\nseveral programs that utilize one or more intensity monitors that can be read\nby the computer. The transmission measurement was carried out, for example,\nby program SPIN. SPIN takes the output of two photodiodes before and one after\nthe filter and uses the relative intensity information to optimize the filter1 s\ntransmission of a He-Ne laser beam. SPIN rotates each tuning element in succession\nthrough its tuning range.\n\nFor each tuning component, the position of maximum\n\ntransmission is stored and the tuner set to that position.\n\nIt has\n\nbeen experimentally discovered that regardless of start position\n\n^f our iteration of the SPIN process yields, a stable maximum filter\ntransmission.\n\nThe SPIN program has also been used as a subroutine in the thermal\nmonitoring procedure.\n\nHere it has allowed determination of the temperature\n\nsensitivity of calcite.\n\nC.\n\nthermal Properties\nProper performance of a very narrow birefringent filter depends on\n\naccurate thermal control or compensation for thermal effects.\n\nIndividual\n\ncalcite elements drift in wavelength by approximately .03A/C at 6000 . For\na filter of 0.1A bandpass, it is desirable to control the temperature to\n0.01A or 0.0333\xc2\xb0C.\n\nIn the LAPPU direct temperature control to a few hundredths of a\ndegree is not attempted. Rather the tuning capability of the filter is used\nto compensate for measured temperature changes. The requirement for stable\noperation then is that the response of the filter to the thermal inputs of\nthe control mechanism are slow compared to the control rate.\n\nIn order to test the sensitivity of the filter to motor heating the motors\nwere all turned on for 30 minutes.\n\nDuring the period of motor heating and\n\nfor one hour thereafter the values of the resistance thermal sensor elements\nwere printed out every 15 seconds. The sensors did not indicate a change\nof more than one count, a temperature change of .005 C> until 35 minutes after\nturn motor off. The sensors reached a peak temperature ^5 minutes after turn\noff.\n\nIn normal operation motors are on only when the filter is changing\n\nwavelength.\n\nSo that this test is a worst case situation.\n\nIn order to test the thermal control algorithm the filter was tuned to\ntransmit a He-Ne laser beam and the transmitted intensity was recorded.\nEvery 3/*4- minutes the filter optimization program was run. Shown as a solid\nline in Figure 30 is the filter transmission versus time.\nthe optimized transmitted intensity.\n26\n\nThe crosses are\n\nBased on the experiments it is not unreasonable to expect that the\nfilter maintain a set wavelength to an accuracy of 0.01A for hours.\n\nThe\n\nmain source of wavelength drift is the temperature sensor electronics.\nWe plan to include a small He-Ne laser and flip mirrors into the filter\ncontrol loop. The laser system shall allow periodic recalibration of the\nthermal sensor system.\n\nD.\n\nOptical Quality\nThe final test of optical quality is a high resolution picture.\n\nUnfortunately, this report is being written during the winter and sufficiently\ngood seeing is not available. However, interferograms have been taken through\nthe filter.\n\nShown in Figure 31 are LUPI (Laser Unequal Path Interferometer)\'\ns\n\ninterferograms of the filter. The filtergrams were taken in X 6328 light\nwith the filter tuned to X 6328. Substantially the same interferograms were\nobtained when the tuning components were rotated by 180\xc2\xb0.\n\nThe tuning\n\ncomponents polaroids and a half wave \'plate^.have been the same filtering effect\nJ\n"\nat angles of alpha and alpha +180 .\n\nIn our opinion the invariance of the interferograms to rotation of the\neight tuning components by 180 indicated that the wave front distortions\nare coming from the fixed filter components.\n\nAt.present we do not know where the wavefront distortions arise.\n\nHowever,\n\nat some time in the future we shall dismantle the filter and check each component critically on the LUPI.\n\nIn any case, the interferograms seem to\n\nindicate that the filter introduces a curvature of less than 2 waves plus a\ncylinder of 2 waves. When the filter is used in an f/30 beam, 15 cm from\nthe focal plane the focus changes introduced by the wavefront distortions\nare less than one tenth the diffraction limited depth of field.\n\n28\n\nE.\n\nAngular Characteristics\nAs discussed in the design section, the angular characteristics\n\nare sensitive to the alignment of, the wide field elements. Shown in\nFigure 32 is a photograph of the angular characteristic of a typical wide\nfield element.\n\nFor the figure the achromatic waveplate was replaced with a\n\nnormal halfwave so that the faint hyperbolic fringes could be photographed.\nActual filter wide field elements are aligned better than shown in Figure\n32.\n\nIn assembly, the circular patterns of all the wide field elements\nwere made coaxial. The only loss in field of view arose because the final\nelement\' s halves are not exactly equal giving rise to an eliptical field\nof view. The principal axes of the elipse differ by less than five percent.\nSo that the field of view is essentially the theoretical field.\n\nFor a wide field filter in a collimated beam, the shift in wavelength\nwith angle is a quadratic function of angle.\n\nIf the maximum allowed shift is\n\n\xc2\xb1 FWHM/10, then at 6500A and ^500A, the field of view of the filter is 2 6\n.\xc2\xb0\nand 2.0 , respectively.\n\nHowever, for this to be the useable field of view,\n\nthe filter must be in front of the objective. When the filter is not in front\nof the objective, but in a collimated section, the field of view is reduced\nby the ratio of the diameter of the filter aperture to the telescope entrance.\nFor a 35 mm aperture filter on a 305 mm diameter objective telescope, the\nfields of view at 6500A and 4500A are 0 3 \xc2\xb0 and 0 2 \xc2\xb0 respectively.\n.0\n.2\n\nIt is unrealistic, however, to expect to use a birefringent filter\nin a collimated beam because the optical quality is seldom sufficiently\nhigh. To minimize aberations, a birefringent filter should be used as\nclose as is practicable to a focal plane.\n\nTo eliminate angular shifts with\n\nangular position, the beam through the filter must be telecentric.\n\nIf a\n\n10 percent increase in FWHM is tolerable at 6500A and 4-500A, f/20 and f/25\nrespectively, telecentric beams are required.\n\nFor a 3 percent allowed in-\n\ncrease in FWHM at 6500A and kJOOA, f/30 and f/36,respectively,/" beams are\nrequired.\n\nIf the filter is near the focal plane, the field of view in a\n\ntelecentric beam is the focal ratio times the ratio of filter to objective\napertures.\nis 0.31\n\nFor a 35 mm filter and 305 mm objective telescope field of view\n\nin an f/20 telecentric beam.\n\n30\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe filter reported here can be improved upon in several ways.\n\nThe first:is\n\nin the performance of the polarizers which both lose a factor of two in light and\nalso limit the wavelength range of the filter.\nthe area of increasing resolution.\n\nA second possible improvement is,in\n\nA third in increasing the free spectral range.\n\ni Finally, great improvement would result from the installation of reliable electrooptic retardation plates. .\n\n__\n\n- -\n\nThe polarizers normally used in birefringent filters are sheet plastic\npolarizers made by Polaroid Corporation or German polarizers supplied by Zeiss\nand Halle. Typically, these have transmissions in the pass direction of .85\nfor high rejection polarizers.\n\nBoth dielectric polarizers and crystal polarizers\n\ncan be made with .98 or greater transmission.\n\nUnfortunately, both of these\n\nelements are cubical or worse in shape and hence add a great deal of length\nto an already long optical path. With some design effort, good wide band dielectric polarizers that operate at 60 to the optic axis could be available.\nSixty degree polarizers would still require lengths of optical path equal\nto half the clear aperture.\n\nPerhaps a solution to the polarizer problem can be obtained by brute\nforce. That is, the polarizers could be exchanged depending on operating wavelength.\n\nWith the polarizers that are not required to rotate for tuning, the\n\nconcept of polarizer exchange becomes fairly reasonable, especially with the\npartial polarizer design which allows half the polarizers to have low rejection\nratios. A set of three polarizers should allow good filter performance from\n3,500 to l^OOOA. And, of course, some research into sheet polarizers may mean\nonly two sets are required.\n\n31\n\nThe filter developed here has a 8 cm final element.\n\nFor a factor of 2\n\ndecrease in bandwidth, it will require 16 cm i-& final element.\nHopefully, we shall fabricate a 0.05A element for this filter in the corning\nyear.\n\nHowever, another factor of 2 will be very hard. Also, recall that\n\nthe filter now has .18 cm of calcite -- a factor of 2 makes this 36 cm, and\n2 again, 72 cm, neglecting all the required waveplates and polarizers.\nOne solution may be to double pass the longer elements. \xc2\xa5e have tried this\nsemi-successfully for the two longest elements of a filter.\n\nThe"semi"\n\nrefers to the fact that the spectral performance was achieved on the spectrograph, but multiple images resulting from the double pass operation existed.\nBecause of time requirements, extensive double pass experiments were not\ncarried out.\n\nUniversal double pass filters will require the development of broad band\npolarizing\n\nbeam splitters, and perhaps high quality corner reflectors.\n\nBut\n\nto really extend the resolution of narrow band filters, it will be necessary\nto develop Michelson final elements.\n\n\xc2\xb0\nA resolution of 105 at 5000A requires a\n\npath difference of 2.5 cm, for calcite which has index difference to index\nratio of 10 -- this means 25 cm of calcite.\n\nA wide field Michelson would re-\n\nquire the aperture diameter plus 2.5 cm in length.\nis optically identical to a birefringent element.\n\nA Michelson at fixed spacing\nIn fact, the idea of a\nQ\n\nMichelson filter has its origin in the 1 ^ classic paper of Evans/\n99\n\nThe present filter has a free spectral range of l^Aat B3 (6563) and . 8A\nat Hp ( 8 l . A state-of-the-art blocker can successfully isolate the solar\n^6)\nlines.\n\nCurrently, the best all-deposited dielectric filters have half widths\n\n32\n\nof 3A. It is unlikely that a factor of two narrowing will be achieved without significant effort.\n\nIn any case, the desire to tune several Angstroms\n\nin the region of a line probably means that there is not much point in lowering the free spectral range of the filter.\n\nA quartz universal filter of nine\n\nelements could extend the free spectral range to nearly ^OOOA.\n\nHopefully,\n\nthe transmission would be 50$ in polarized light which is competitive with\nthe transmission of a ^A blocker.\n\nTuning of this filter is accomplished by mechanical rotation of polarizers\nand waveplates.\n\nIt would be highly desirable to tune the filter electrically\n\nusing electric waveplates.\nplates.\n\nExtensive experiments were carried out with KDP\n\nHowever, we were not able to fabricate reliable electrode structures\n\nfor B.C. operation (less than 200 Hz).\n\nOne experimental waveplate lasted two\n\nweeks at 3000 VDC before failure. There is some possibility that transparent\nelectrodes could be cold sputtered on KDP or some other electro-optic crystal.\nAttempts to purchase electric waveplates has also failed.\n\nCurrently we have\n\nan outstanding order for two electric waveplates with cold sputtered electrodes.\n\n33\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nJ.M.
