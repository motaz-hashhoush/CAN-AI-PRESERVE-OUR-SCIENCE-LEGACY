[yourSky is an upgraded version of the software reported in Software for Generating Mosaics of Astronomical Images (NPO-21121), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 25, No. 4 (April 2001), page 16a.] A requester no longer has to engage in the tedious process of determining what subset of images is needed, nor even to know how the images are indexed in image archives. Instead, in response to a requester s specification of the size and location of the sky area, (and optionally of the desired set and type of data, resolution, coordinate system, projection, and image format), yourSky automatically retrieves the component image data from archives totaling tens of terabytes stored on computer tape and disk drives at multiple sites and assembles the component images into a mosaic image by use of a high-performance parallel code. yourSky runs on the server computer where the mosaics are assembled. Because yourSky includes a Web-interface component, no special client software is needed: ordinary Web browser software is sufficient.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110024171, "id": "2e876e7af9d149148799de4b5257e5ab", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, June 2003", "publicationDate": "2003-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20110024140, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, June 2003", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110024171.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110024171/downloads/20110024171.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110024171/downloads/20110024171.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110024171/downloads/20110024171.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
