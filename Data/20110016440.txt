b'Software\nProgram Predicts Time\nCourses of Human/\nComputer Interactions\nCPM X is a computer program that\npredicts sequences of, and amounts of\ntime taken by, routine actions performed by a skilled person performing a\ntask. Unlike programs that simulate the\ninteraction of the person with the task\nenvironment, CPM X predicts the time\ncourse of events as consequences of encoded constraints on human behavior.\nThe constraints determine which cognitive and environmental processes can\noccur simultaneously and which have sequential dependencies. The input to\nCPM X comprises (1) a description of a\ntask and strategy in a hierarchical description language and (2) a description\nof architectural constraints in the form\nof rules governing interactions of fundamental cognitive, perceptual, and motor\noperations. The output of CPM X is a\nProgram Evaluation Review Technique\n(PERT) chart that presents a schedule of\npredicted cognitive, motor, and perceptual operators interacting with a task environment. The CPM X program allows\ndirect, a priori prediction of skilled user\nperformance on complex human-machine systems, providing a way to assess\ncritical interfaces before they are deployed in mission contexts.\nThis program was written by Alonso Vera of\nAmes Research Center and Andrew Howes\nof Cardiff University.

CGT contains a large collection of tools for generating overset grids, preparing inputs for\ncomputer programs that solve equations\nof flow on the grids, and post-processing\nof flow-solution data. The tools in CGT\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, December 2005\n\ninclude grid editing tools, surface-gridgeneration tools, volume-grid-generation tools, utility scripts, configuration\nscripts, and tools for post-processing (including generation of animated images\nof flows and calculating forces and moments exerted on affected bodies). One\nof the tools, denoted OVERGRID, is a\ngraphical user interface (GUI) that\nserves to visualize the grids and flow solutions and provides central access to\nmany other tools. The GUI facilitates the\ngeneration of grids for a new flow-field\nconfiguration. Scripts that follow the\ngrid generation process can then be\nconstructed to mostly automate grid\ngeneration for similar configurations.\nCGT is designed for use in conjunction\nwith a computer-aided-design program\nthat provides the geometry description\nof the bodies, and a flow-solver program.\nThis program was written by William M.\nChan and Stuart E. Rogers of Ames Research Center, Steven M. Nash of\nELORET Corp., Pieter G. Buning of Langley\nResearch Center, and Robert L. Meakin of the\nU.S. Army Aeroflightdynamics Directorate.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed\nto the Technology Partnerships Division,\nAmes Research Center, (650) 604-2954.\nRefer to ARC-15399-1.\n\nAstronomer\xe2\x80\x99s Proposal Tool\nAstronomer\xe2\x80\x99s Proposal Tool (APT) is\na computer program that assists astronomers in preparing their Phase 1\nand Phase 2 Hubble Space Telescope science programs. APT is a successor to the\nRemote Proposal Submission System 2\n(RPS2) program, which has been rendered obsolete by more recent advances\nin computer software and hardware.\nAPT exploits advances associated with\nwidespread use of the Internet, multiplatform visual development software\ntools, and overall increases in the power\nof desktop computer hardware, all in\nsuch a way as to make the preparation\nand submission of proposals more intuitive and make observatory operations\nless cumbersome. APT provides documentation and help that are friendly, up\nto date, and easily accessible to users of\nvarying levels of expertise, while defining an extensible framework that is responsive to changes in both technology\n\nand observatory operations. APT consists of two major components: (1) a set\nof software tools that are intuitive, visual, and responsive and (2) an integrated software environment that unifies all the tools and makes them\ninteroperable. The APT tools include\nthe Visual Target Tuner, Proposal Editor, Exposure Planner, Bright Object\nChecker, and Visit Planner.\nThis program was written by a team of software developers led by Tony Krueger at the\nSpace Telescope Science Institute for Goddard\nSpace Flight Center.

The mesh-sequencing algorithm makes it possible to perform preliminary computations using\nonly a fraction of the grid cells (provided the original cell count is divisible\nby an integer) along any grid coordinate\naxis, independently of the other axes.\nThe patch algorithm addresses another\ncritical need in multi-block grid situation where the cell faces of adjacent grid\nblocks may not coincide, leading to errors in calculating fluxes of conserved\nphysical quantities across interfaces between the blocks. The patch algorithm,\nbased on the Stokes integral formulation of the applicable conservation laws,\neffectively matches each of the interfacial cells on one side of the block interface to the corresponding fractional cell\narea pieces on the other side. This approach is comprehensive and unified\nsuch that all interface topology is automatically processed without user intervention. This algorithm is implemented\nin a preprocessing code that creates a\ncell-by-cell database that will maintain\nflux conservation at any level of full or\nreduced grid density as the user may\n\n13\n\n'
