b'Design Considerations for a Crewed Mars Ascent Vehicle\nMichelle A. Rucker1\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, 77058\n\nAbstract\nExploration architecture studies identified the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) as one of the\nlargest \xe2\x80\x9cgear ratio\xe2\x80\x9d items in a crewed Mars mission. Because every kilogram of mass\nascended from the Martian surface requires seven kilograms or more of ascent propellant, it\nis desirable for the MAV to be as small and lightweight as possible. Analysis identified four\nkey factors that drive MAV sizing:\n1) Number of crew: more crew members require more equipment\xe2\x80\x94and a larger cabin\ndiameter to hold that equipment\xe2\x80\x94with direct implications to structural, thermal,\npropulsion, and power subsystem mass.\n2) Which suit is worn during ascent: Extravehicular Activity (EVA) type suits are\nphysically larger and heavier than Intravehicular Activity (IVA) type suits and because\nthey are less flexible, EVA suits require more elbow-room to maneuver in and out of. An\nempty EVA suit takes up about as much cabin volume as a crew member.\n3) How much time crew spends in the MAV: less than about 12 hours and the MAV can be\nconsidered a \xe2\x80\x9ctaxi\xe2\x80\x9d with few provisions for crew comfort. However, if the crew spends\nmore than 12 consecutive hours in the MAV, it begins to look like a Habitat requiring\nmore crew comfort items.\n4) How crew get into/out of the MAV: ingress/egress method drives structural mass (for\nexample, EVA hatch vs. pressurized tunnel vs. suit port) as well as consumables mass\nfor lost cabin atmosphere, and has profound impacts on surface element architecture.\nTo minimize MAV cabin mass, the following is recommended: Limit MAV usage to 24\nconsecutive hours or less; discard EVA suits on the surface and ascend wearing IVA suits;\nLimit MAV functionality to ascent only, rather than dual-use ascent/habitat functions; and\ningress/egress the MAV via a detachable tunnel to another pressurized surface asset.\n\nNomenclature\ng\nkg\nkN\nm\nm3\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nEarth standard gravitational force\nkilogram\nkilo Newton\nmeter\ncubic meters\n\nI. Introduction\nCrewed Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) designs fall into one of two broad categories: 1) a relatively large habitable\nvariant that serves as both ascent vehicle and habitat, either on the surface or in orbit; or 2) a much smaller taxi\nvariant used only for a few hours during the actual ascent. The taxi variant requires another Mars surface asset for\nhabitation. Note that in some architectures, the Mars ascent vehicle might also be used as the crew\xe2\x80\x99s descent vehicle.\nAscent vehicles are generally regarded as the largest \xe2\x80\x9cgear ratio\xe2\x80\x9d item in a given architecture; in other words,\nevery kilogram of an ascent vehicle needs more Earth-launched mass to do its job than most other architecture\nelements need. Even if ascent propellant can be manufactured on Mars, current technologies still require the ascent\nvehicle\xe2\x80\x94and the propellant manufacturing plant\xe2\x80\x94be launched from Earth, transported to and then descended onto\n1\n\nEngineer, Exploration Integration and Science Directorate, Mail Stop XM.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nMars, all of which entails a considerable amount of transit and descent propulsion mass. The overall gear ratio\ndepends on end-to-end mission architecture. Analysis performed by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) estimates that the amount of propellant needed to boost a single kilogram of ascent vehicle\nto a 1-sol Mars orbit ranges between 3.5 kg (for an ideal rocket) to as much as 15 kg for a stage mass fraction of\n0.73. For the purpose of this exercise, the ascent gear ratio was assumed to be at the lower end of the range, or 7:1\n(seven kilograms of ascent propellant to boost every one kilogram of MAV inert mass).\n\nII. Factors That Drive Cabin Size\nClearly, the smaller the ascent vehicle, the lower the overall Earth-launched mass will be, which often means\nlower mission cost. Although many factors will affect a final MAV design, there are at least four key drivers for\nMAV cabin size: number of crew, what the crew is wearing during ascent, how much time crew spends in the MAV,\nand how crew get into or out of the MAV\nA. Number of Crew\nThe number of crew drives MAV size both directly (more crew require a larger cabin volume) and indirectly (a\nlarger cabin requires more thermal protection and longer avionics cables, which in turn requires more power mass,\nall of which drives ascent propellant load). For the purpose of this exercise, it was assumed that at least two crew\nmembers would land on Mars in even the most minimalist scenario, and the maximum crew complement would be\nlimited by the Orion return vehicle, which is sized for up to six.\nMore crew members simply require more physical elbow room. Work done as part of the Constellation\nProgram\xe2\x80\x99s Altair Lunar Lander project1 concluded that four standing crew members packed quite close together\nonly need about a 1.8 m diameter cabin for a short duration ascent. Six crew obviously require more (Figure 1),\nprobably at least a 2.2 m diameter cabin. Two crew members would require less volume, possibly as low as a 1.58 m\ndiameter cabin. Note that many factors could increase taxi cabin diameter. For example, if crew ascend in recumbent\nseats (rather than standing up) or will be performing active piloting, then a larger cabin will be required. In any case,\nthe structural mass difference between 1.58 m and 2.2 m diameter crew cabins could be quite significant.\nAt 82.2 kg for a 50th percentile male crew member2, a six-crew MAV has to carry at least 328.8 kg more load\nthan a two-crew MAV. With 95th percentile male crew, the difference grows to 394 kg. If each kilogram of MAV\nmass requires just seven kilograms of ascent propellant to reach a\none-sol orbit, that extra 328 to 394 kg of crew will require as much\nas 2,758 kg more ascent propellant, which in turn requires larger\npropellant tanks and more structural support.\nIn addition to the crew, the MAV cabin must also accommodate\ncrew equipment, even for short ascent durations. At a minimum,\neach crew member will need either a Portable Life Support System\n(PLSS) or an oxygen umbilical for cabin depressurization\ncontingencies. At as much as 0.75 m x 0.56 m x 0.254 m for a\nFigure 1. Top view of Cabin: four vs. six\nPLSS, or 0.127 m diameter x 4.58 m long for even a short\ncrew.\nIntravehicular (IVA) oxygen umbilical, equipment volume quickly\nadds up, especially for six crew members. If the crew must remain\ninside the MAV for more than a few hours, additional equipment\nwill be required (discussed below).\nOne obvious way to reduce MAV mass is to remove the\npressure cabin altogether, such as the concept shown in Figure 2.\nAlthough this can reduce structural, thermal, and power mass,\nthere are a number of disadvantages. An unpressurized MAV\nwould require crew to remain in their Extravehicular Activity\n(EVA) suits, which is currently untenable for a lengthy (more than\n24 hour) ascent. Ascending in EVA suits contaminated with\nsurface dust also poses the problem of planetary protection, which\nwill require suit decontamination before the crew transfers into\ntheir transit vehicle (and further extends the time crew must remain\nin their suits). With no shell between the crew and the MAV\xe2\x80\x99s\nreaction control system thrusters, EVA suit contamination is Figure 2. Unpressurized ascent vehicle\nanother concern because thruster plumes may damage the suits or concept.\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ndeposit toxic contaminants that can then be transferred into the destination vehicle. Although eliminating the\npressure cabin eliminates the mass of a pressurized docking system, this requires an EVA transfer into the orbiting\ntransit habitat, which could be risky in the event of an incapacitated crew member. This concept precludes dual use\nof the MAV for surface habitation, forcing the architecture to carry a separate pressurized surface element. What\xe2\x80\x99s\nmore, an unpressurized MAV cannot be used as a temporary safe-haven in a surface contingency. All of these issues\ncan be mitigated, but the mass penalties may outweigh the benefits.\nB. IVA vs. EVA Suits\nDue to the possibility of a sudden cabin depressurization\nit is generally assumed that crew members will ascend in\neither EVA or IVA suits. The choice of ascent suit can impact\nMAV cabin size not only because the EVA suits are\nphysically larger than the IVA suits (Figure 3), but also\nbecause EVA suits will likely be contaminated with surface\ndust which will require additional equipment to control.\nCabin mockup testing1 identified the EVA suit\xe2\x80\x99s bulky\ndesign as a potential cabin configuration driver. For example,\neven with their PLSS\xe2\x80\x99s removed, pilots were unable to stand\nside by side in a 2.35 m diameter cylindrical vehicle without Figure 3. Size comparison of IVA (orange) and\ncontact between their suit\xe2\x80\x99s PLSS plates (Figure 4). This EVA (white) space suit Concepts\npotentially drives the placement or size of piloting controls,\nwindows, and other equipment.\nSimulated microgravity testing performed during the\nConstellation Program also identified problems passing a\nlarge, pressurized EVA suit through the docking system hatch\ntunnel3. The workaround would have required EVA transfer\nbetween the Altair lunar lander and Orion in the event of an\nascent vehicle depressurization. Since testing found no issues\nwith the IVA suits, this contingency EVA\xe2\x80\x94as well as the\nneed for even longer EVA umbilical hoses stowed in the\nMAV\xe2\x80\x94 can be avoided on a Mars ascent simply by\nswitching the crew into their IVA suits prior to ascent.\nEVA suits also pose a significant ascent mass penalty\nover the IVA suits. At roughly 75 kg difference between an\nIVA and EVA suit (not including the PLSS), the mass penalty Figure 4. EVA suit contact in curved cabin\nfor six crew members is about 450 kg; with the 7:1 propellant ratio, that difference adds another 3,150 kg of\npropellant (plus larger propellant tanks, more tank structure, etc.) simply to accommodate the larger suits.\nThe downside to acending in IVA suits is that it requires the crew to discard their EVA suits on the surface. This\nposes an immediate problem of how to switch from EVA to IVA suits in a small cabin, and then get the EVA suits\nout of the MAV before ascent. Leaving the suits behind also means that at least two fresh EVA suits would have to\nbe available on the in-space return vehicle for EVA contingencies, adding to the overall mission cost. On the other\nhand, planetary protection is simplified if surface EVA suits can be kept out of the MAV altogether, as this\neliminates the need to scrub Mars regolith from the suits or MAV cabin atmosphere, which would require additional\nMAV equipment mass.\nAscending in IVA suits poses one significant risk: in the event of a MAV-to-transfer vehicle docking failure, the\ncrew cannot simply exit a side hatch and translate externally because the IVA suits do not provide sufficient thermal\nprotection for EVA excursions. Several workarounds have been proposed, including a thermal \xe2\x80\x9covercoat\xe2\x80\x9d that could\nbe used for brief, emergency EVA exposure. Another approach is to break the contingency down into more\nmanageable parts, and look at the three failure possibilities: 1) the MAV docks, but the docking hatch becomes\njammed; 2) the MAV can soft-dock, but not hard-dock; or 3) the MAV cannot even soft-dock. In the event the MAV\nfails to soft-dock, the MAV may be too far from the transit vehicle for an EVA transfer anyway, regardless of which\nsuits the crew is wearing. The program will have to either accept the potential crew safety risk, or explore grapple\nfixtures, jet-packs, or other means to mitigate this risk before the suit decision comes into play. In the event the\nMAV can soft-dock, but not hard-dock, crew will still be able to translate through the unpressurized docking tunnel\nin their IVA suits as long as their umbilical hoses are long enough. Finally, the jammed docking hatch contingency\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nwas addressed in previous studies by assuming the MAV carried a jammed hatch tool kit, estimated at about five\nkilograms mass penalty.\nC. MAV Mission Duration\nPreliminary ascent timelines to a one-sol orbit estimate that crew must remain in the MAV for up to 43 hours,\nassuming a single missed launch opportunity. Crew time inside the MAV could be minimized by ascending to a\nlower orbit, or eliminating the missed launch contingency assumption altogether. Including pre-ascent vehicle\npreparations though, crew is likely to be inside the MAV for at least 24 hours. If the MAV ascends to a higher orbit,\nor serves double-duty as a short surface stay habitat, the crew may be living/working in the MAV for up to a week.\nHow long the crew must remain in the MAV greatly impacts MAV mass. If the crew only has to be inside for a\nfew hours, they can remain in their spacesuits, with the limiting factor likely the Maximum Absorbency Garment\n(MAG), currently rated for eight hours. Materials and design modification may be able to extend operational use a\nfew more hours but current designs require spacesuit doffing to replace a soiled MAG. Because the Constellation\nProgram required4 Orion to sustain suited crew in an unpressurized cabin for several days in a worst-case\ncontingency, extended in-suit waste management is a NASA technology goal5. Until then, a practical limit of 12 to\n24 hours for nominal (planned) operations is a reasonable assumption.\nIf crew are inside the MAV long enough that they need to replace soiled MAGs, MAV cabin diameter will grow\ndramatically. First, there is the problem of doffing suits. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Human Integration Design Handbook6\nrecommends 6.35 cubic meters (m3) for Space Shuttle-style EVA suit don/doff in micro-gravity. Cabin mockup\ntesting performed as part of the Altair project7 confirmed that suit don/doff was a significant cabin volume driver\n(and may be more pronounced in a surface gravity field than in micro-gravity). Note that new rear-entry EVA suit\nconcepts require a crew member to pull him/herself up and out of the suit, which drives cabin ceiling height. IVA\ntype suits require a bit less volume to don/doff.\nOnce the suits are removed, the immediate problem of suit\nstowage must be addressed. As noted, EVA suits are bulkier\nthan IVA suits, but a suit takes up about as much cabin volume\nas a crew member. In the worst-case, if all six crew members\nhave to remove their EVA suits, the MAV must essentially be\nsized as a 12-crew pressure cabin (Figure 5). MAV volume\ncould be optimized for ascent if crew stagger suit don/doff, so\nthat only one crew member is out of their suit at any given\ntime, but this workaround isn\xe2\x80\x99t practical if the MAV is used for\nsurface habitability as well as for ascent, unless the MAV is\nmated to another pressurized element on the surface such as an\nairlock or habitat.\nTo prevent damage to the suits, it is preferable to place\nthem in stowage bags. The working assumption for early\nConstellation Program studies was 1.04 m3 volume per EVA\nsuit, with each stowage bag estimated to be 14.55 kg. Once\nsuits have been doffed and stowed, the next concern is waste\nand hygiene. Privacy for removing soiled MAGs could be\nFigure 5. Cabin Model with six crew and EVA\nprovided with a simple curtain at relatively small volume\nsuits\npenalty. Volume needed to dispose of soiled MAGs will\ndepend on how long the crew must remain inside the MAV\xe2\x80\x94a\ntrash bag is probably sufficient for a single day, but longer durations will require more elaborate disposal methods to\nminimize cabin odor and contamination. Per NASA-STD-30018 a six-crew cabin would accumulate about 54 liters\nof urine after just three days. At that point, a rudimentary toilet may trade well for mass and stowage volume.\nUsing the MAV for surface habitability will dramatically increase MAV size, with sleeping expected to be a key\ndriver. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Human Integration Design Handbook6 recommends 2.69 m3 per crew member for activities such as\nsleeping and sheltering. Although sleep bunks can be stacked vertically to save floor space, the cabin has to be at\nleast as wide as the tallest crew member to avoid forcing the Table 1. Crew mass and stature comparison\ncrew to sleep in a fetal position or on an incline.\nStature per NASA SSP 50005\nOne option for reducing MAV diameter may be to limit\nPercentile\nFemale\nMale\nsurface crew stature. For example, the difference between 50th\n148.9 cm\n169.7 cm\n5th\nand 95th percentile male crew statures is about 10.2 cm (Table\n157.0 cm\n179.9 cm\n50th\n1). Accounting for cabin curvature, this change would drop the\n165.1 cm\n190.1 cm\n95th\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ninternal cabin diameter from at least 2.06 m to about 1.885 m diameter. Although that may seem insignificant,\nextended over a 3 m cabin height this simple change translates to an internal cabin volume reduction of more than\n1.6 m3, and a cabin barrel section surface area savings of about 1.65 m2, both of which offer flow-down savings to\nstructures, power, thermal protection, and life support subsystems\xe2\x80\x94all multiplied by the 7:1 propellant gear ratio.\nAlthough limiting crew stature would prompt lively debate, to put things into perspective it should be noted that the\nApollo 11 surface crew fall just under the 50th percentile stature definition by current NASA standards.\nAlthough sleep bunks can be folded up during waking hours to\nextend working volume, there is still the problem of where to stow\nequipment at night. Food, clothing, hygiene supplies, a first aid kit,\nscience equipment, and EVA consumables (MAGs, spare gloves, etc.)\nmust all be stowed inside the habitable volume, along with vehicle\nequipment such as piloting controls and displays, power interface panels,\nor crew umbilical hoses. Figure 6 gives an idea of how much equipment\nis required to support six crew members for a week on the surface, in a\nHabitable MAV.\nAnother factor that could affect MAV sizing is whether the crew also\ndescends to the surface inside the MAV. If descending in the MAV, the\ncrew will almost certainly need recumbent seats (Figure 7) for\nprotection. Cabin volume for seats themselves must be accounted for in\ncabin sizing, as well as descent and ascent propellant loads needed for\nseat mass. MAV engineering analysis typically assumes the crew can Figure 6. Equipment for six crew for\nstand during ascent (a hold-over from Constellation Program concepts),\na week\nbut the decision will ultimately hinge on crew safety. Preliminary\nestimates for a 3,623 kg crew cabin, with 0.80 stage mass fraction, and\n100 kN thrust engines is about 1.5 g at the end of the first stage\xe2\x80\x94\nrelatively gentle compared to the Space Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s lift-off, but potentially\ndangerous for a crew that\xe2\x80\x99s spent more than 500 days at reduced Martian\ngravity following a six month transit in microgravity.\nOrion-type recumbent seats, sized for Earth re-entry, are estimated at\nup to 27 kg each, but lower mass seats may be adequate for Mars ascent\nor descent. Note that seats may be removed from the MAV after landing\n(unless they are needed during ascent), but this may drive MAV cabin\nhatch design. To reduce overall landed mass, common seating might be\nshared between the MAV and surface rovers, though again that may\ndrive either seat or hatch design to allow seat relocation between the two Figure 7. Six crew in recumbent seats\nvehicles.\nFinally, some consideration must be given to return cargo, which may be as much9 as 250 kg. Conventional\nwisdom says there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to ascend more return cargo than what Orion can accommodate (which may be as\nlow as 100 kg), but it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that Mars return science samples could be diverted to another destination (an\norbiting outpost, for example), or designed for a separate Earth re-entry. To protect science sample integrity, as well\nas to protect both the crew and Earth from forward contamination, science sample containers must be sealed and\ndecontaminated before entering either the MAV or the orbiting transit vehicle. Returning science samples could be\nstowed outside the MAV pressure cabin, which eliminates the landed mass penalty for sealing/decontamination\nequipment. On the other hand, this will require an EVA transfer from the MAV to the Earth transit vehicle, which\nmay result in a net mass increase.\nD. MAV Ingress/Egress\nHow the crew gets into or out of the MAV has profound implications on mission element architecture. There are\nat least five possible ingress/egress operations in a crewed Mars surface mission:\n1) Transferring from Orion or an Earth transit vehicle into the MAV in microgravity (if descending in the\nMAV).\n2) Egressing the MAV to perform a surface EVA or transit to another surface asset (such as a habitat) in Mars\ngravity.\n3) Ingressing/egressing the MAV in Mars gravity to retrieve logistics supplies or stow return cargo.\n4) Ingressing the MAV in Mars gravity to ascend to Mars orbit.\n5) Egressing the MAV in microgravity to return to Orion or the Earth transit vehicle.\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nCurrent ingress/egress methods include EVA hatches, IVA tunnels (Figure 8), and Suit Ports (Figure 9).\nThere are three key considerations for MAV ingress/egress design.\nFirst, which suits will the crew be wearing during ingress/egress? As\nnoted above, a pressurized IVA suit can pass through a standard\nexploration docking hatch, but a pressurized EVA suit requires a larger\nhatch. On the other hand, IVA suits are unsuitable for surface\noperations, and cannot be used with EVA hatches alone. Second,\nwhere will crew be changing from IVA to EVA suits, or vice versa? If\nthe MAV is large enough for all crew members to change into their\nEVA suits, then an EVA hatch is acceptable. But if the MAV isn\xe2\x80\x99t\nlarge enough to get out of their IVA suits, the crew can\xe2\x80\x99t explore the\nsurface or get to another vehicle without a tunnel, suit port, or attached\nairlock. Finally, how much dust can be tolerated inside the MAV?\nApollo experience10warns that opening an EVA hatch directly to the Figure 8. IVA Tunnel\nsurface will bring surface dust into the ascent vehicle. This will drive\nMAV cabin design and equipment mass to prevent Martian dust from\nmigrating back into Orion and eventually to Earth, in violation of\nplanetary protection protocols11.\n1. EVA Hatch\nEVA hatches have the benefit of relatively low mass and high\nTechnology Readiness Level (TRL). But because an EVA hatch would\nrequire MAV depressurization for every ingress/egress, everything in\nthe cabin would have to be rated for extended Mars surface atmosphere\nexposure, and all crew members would have to suit up even if only one\nwas actually leaving the cabin\xe2\x80\x94which means the MAV would still\nhave to be big enough for all crew members to ingress/egress their Figure 9. Suit port concept\nsuits together. Altair project mockup testing found that even three\nEVA suited crew could stand together in a relatively small 1.8 m\ndiameter cabin (Figure 10). However, getting into and out of their\nEVA suits was hampered by a rear-entry suit design that requires the\nPLSS hatch to swing open laterally for suit doffing (Figure 11). In\npractice, this either forces the cabin diameter to grow to accommodate\nPLSS hatch swing, or it will drive a fundamental design change to the\nEVA suits. These issues aside, the biggest drawback to an EVA hatch\nis that it will be more difficult to keep dust out of the MAV or prevent\nMartian dust from migrating back to Orion, and eventually to Earth.\n2. Suit Port\nSuit ports offer the promise of dust mitigation by keeping dusty Figure 10. Three crew in 1.8 m\nsuits outside the cabin, but current protocol still requires an EVA diameter cabin\nhatch to get the suits outside for the first EVA, and back inside after\nthe final EVA. This is primarily because current designs don\xe2\x80\x99t provide\nenough structural support to protect the suits from ascent/descent\nloads or potential thruster plume impingement. Concepts to address\nthese problems have been proposed, but add even more mass to each\nsuit port (which are already about 100 kg each). Even if the structural\nproblem is resolved, an EVA hatch is still required for an\nincapacitated crew member contingency, since it may not be possible\nto pull an unconscious person up through the suit\xe2\x80\x99s rear-entry hatch to\nsafety.\nAt nearly one meter centerline-to-centerline spacing between suit Figure 11. PLSS management issues\nports, a small MAV cabin diameter is unlikely to provide sufficient\nreal estate for more than two suit ports. This poses operational timeline impacts in getting four or six member crews\nin or out of the vehicle. Crews could ingress two at a time, but once the first two are inside, their suits would have to\nbe removed from the suit ports before the next two crew members could ingress. Once detached from the suit port,\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nan empty suit can be damaged if the water inside freezes, which means additional thermal conditioning mass will be\nneeded outside the vehicle for suit stowage\xe2\x80\x94exacerbating what is already a poor mass trade for the suit ports.\nWorse, to protect against a contingency where the MAV engines fail to ignite and crew need to retreat back to a\nhabitable element, the MAV may have to keep one or two EVA suits attached to its suit ports until lift-off, further\nadding complexity and mass.\nAlthough suit ports make sense for frequent excursions from a relatively large surface asset (such as a rover or\nhabitat), suit ports do not seem to be a good fit for the MAV.\n3. Tunnel\nFor architectures where another element provides\nhabitability function (such as a rover or habitat), or\nwhere an airlock module is paired with the MAV,\nretractable tunnels (Figure 12) are an attractive option.\nBy pushing the suit don/doff and EVA operations to an\nelement that remains on the surface, MAV ascent mass\nand dust can be minimized. Although a tunnel is likely to\npose a significant descended mass impact, the 7:1\npropellant penalty does not apply if the tunnel remains on\nthe surface. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, retractable tunnels allow\nsurface assets to be re-configured, built up over time, or\nreconfigured as needed.\nIdeally, pressurized tunnels would provide a shirtsleeve crew transfer path between elements. The tunnel Figure 12. Retractable tunnel from MAV to rover\nconcept may work unpressurized as well, but would\nrequire umbilical hoses at least as long as the tunnel. A tunnel would also allow MAV crews to discard their EVA\nsuits in a thermally-conditioned, secure element for later mission re-use or scavenge, rather than discarding them on\nthe surface. This protects the crew in a contingency scenario where the MAV engines fail to ignite; crew can simply\nretreat back through the tunnel to the habitable element for troubleshooting. Strictly speaking, a tunnel does not have\nto be retractable but one-time use options such as pyrotechnic detachment may not make sense for a long-duration\nmission where surface elements will be re-used or reconfigured over time.\nOne downside to tunnels is that they may be awkward when moving between elements at different elevations, as\ndepicted in Figure 12, though it may still be safer than EVA crews climbing down an exposed ladder. Another\ndisadvantage is that pressurized tunnels\xe2\x80\x94or unpressurized tunnels with long umbilical hoses\xe2\x80\x94will require a robust\nenvironmental control and life support system feeding the tunnel from at one or both of the two mated elements.\n\nIII. Conclusion\nBased on the observations noted above, the following steps are recommended to minimize MAV cabin mass,\nthus reducing overall mission mass:\n1) Limit MAV usage to 24 consecutive hours or less.\n2) Abandon EVA suits in a surface asset and ascend in the MAV wearing IVA suits.\n3) Limit MAV functionality to ascent only, rather than dual-use ascent/habitat functions.\n4) Ingress/egress the MAV via a retractable tunnel to another pressurized surface asset.\n\nAcknowledgments\nGraphics provided courtesy of John Teter, Victor Dang, Tim Collins, Dan Miller, and David Paddock.
