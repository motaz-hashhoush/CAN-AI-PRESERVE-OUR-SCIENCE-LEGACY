INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Cosmic Microwave Background (Cl\\JB) is a pov!erfulprobe of early universe physics. 1feasurements of the\ntemperature anisotropy power spectrum are critical in establishing the concordance ACDl\\! model (e.g. Liddle &\nLyth 2000, and references therein), and measurements of\nCMB polarization currently provide the best prospects\nfor confirming inflation or constraining the level of the\nprimordial grayitational wave background. The C11B\nis polarized via Thomson scattering off tempera.ture\nanisotropies. The curl-free component of the polarization\nfield (E-mode polarization) is generated by the same dene\nsitv inhomogeneities responsible for the measured temperature anisotropy. However a measurement of tl:e Emode- polarization can break degeneracies in cosmological\nparameters inherent to measurements of the temperature\nanisotropy spectrum alone. A divergence-free component\nof the polarization field (B-mode polarization) is generated from three possible sources. One is from ler..sing\nof E-mode polarization into B-mode polarization by intervening large-scale structure along the line-of-sight. It\ncan be used to probe structure formation in the early universe. The second could come from a large class of inflationary models that predict a spectrum of grayitational\nwaves generated during inflation which could produce a\nmeasureable B-mode amplitude around f ~ 100 (Selja!<\n& Zalciarriaga 1997; Kamionkowski et al. 1997; Dodelson\net al. 2009). The detection of these B-modes, parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, would. provide a\nmeasurement of the energy scale of inflation. A third\ncontribution to both E-mode and B-mode polarization\nspectra is expected from polarized foreground emission.\nUnderstanding the spectral dependence and spatial distribution of foregrounds is critical for pushing the limits\nof B-mode polarization detection or constraint.\nThe\ngoal of detecting or placing competitive constraints on\nthe inflationary B-rnode CMB polarization signature led\nus to optiinize QUIET 26 for both sensitivity and control\nof systematic errors. We demodulate the signal at tKO\nphase-switching rates ("double demodulation") to reduce\nboth the 1/f noise and instrumental systematic effects.\nIn addition, our scan strategy, consisting of constant elevation scans performed between regular elevation s:.eps,\nfrequent boresight rotations, and natural sky rotation\nreduces systematic errors. Using arrays with two widely\nseparated bandpasses centered between atmospheric absorption features allows lis to separate a cosmological\nsignal from Galactic foreground signals.\nThis paper describes the QUIET instrument, designed\nto measure the CMB polarization and the synchrotron\nforeground. Tabie 1 lists the salient characteristics of\nthe QUIET experiment. Figures l(a) and l(b) show\nviews of the receIver, telescope, and electronics enclosure. QUIET deployed tv.\xc2\xb7O arrays of 19 and 90 HEMTbased coherent detector assemblies in the Chajnc:.ntor\nplateau in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile. The\nextreme aridity of this region results in excellent observing conditions for most of the year (Radford & Holdaway 1998). The arrays operate at central frequencies\n2.6 Bruce Winstein, \\1:ho died in 2011 February soon after obser~tlOns were completed, wru; the principal investigator for QUIET.\nHIS intellectual and scientific guidance were crucial to the experi-\n\nment\'s success.\n\nof 43 GHz and 95 GHz for the Q-banri and W-band receivers, respectively, and are the largest HE1\\.IT-based\narrays used to date. In the focal plane, each assembly\ncontains passh-e waveguide components and a module\na small interchangeable HEMT-based electronics pack:\nage. Within these two arravs, 17 (84) of the Q-band\n(~-band) assemblies are polarirneters, each measuring\nsImultaneously the Q, U, and I Stokes parameters. The\nremaining 2 (6) assemblies measure the CMB temperature anisotropy ("differential-temperature assemblies").\nThe Q-band and W-band assemblies are cooled to \'" 20K\nand 27 K, respectively, in a cryostat and placed at the focus of a 1.4 m side-fed Dragonian telescope enclosed in an\nabsorbing ground screen. The resulting full width at half\nmaJ<imum (FWHl\\!) angular resolution is 27.3\' (11.7\') for\neach Q-band (W-band) assembly.\nThe following sections describe the observing site and\nstrategy, optics, cryogenics and the optical window prODerties, polarimeter and differential-temperature asseriIblies, electronics, and calibration tools. Finally, we\npresent a detailed description of the performance of both\nreceivers.\n2. OBSERVING SITE AND STRATEGY\n\nObservations (Table 2) were performed at the Chajnantor plateau at 5080 m altitude in the Atacama Desert\nof Northern Chile (67"45\' 42"W 23"1\'42"8). Atmospheric\nconditions were monitored using data from a 183 GHz\nline ,adiometer located at the APEX telescope (Glisten\net al. 2006), ~ 1 km away from the QUIET site. Typical\natmospheric optical depths in our observing bands over\nall scanning elevations at Chajnantor are 0.02-0.1 (Figure 2). The median l\'recipitable water vapor (PWV) was\n1.2 mm (0.9 mm) durmg the Q-band (W-band) observing\nseason. The data fraction surviving data selection fo~ the\nQ-band (W-band) arrays are 82% (75%) of the data below the median PWV, and 59% (54%) of the data above\nthe median PWV. Because the Q-band is affected primarIly by the oxygen absorption liYle in the atmosphere,\nwater\xc2\xb7 vapor variations will typically have a greater effect on the W -band data quality than the Q-band data\nquality.\nWe employed a fixed-elevation, azimuth-scanning technique: a ~ 15" x 15" field (the fields are given ia Table 2) W!lB scanned in azimuth as it drifted through .the\n~ 7" (~ 8") field-of-view for the Q-band (W-band) array.\nThese constant elevation scans (CES) typically lasted ~\n40-90 minutes. The telescope then re-tracked the field\nce:c.ter and began another CES. By scanning at constant elevation for a given scan, we observed through\na constant column density of atmosphere so that only\nweather variations within a scan contributed an atmospheric signal. ~Iost calibration sources were obseryed at\nTABLE 1\nINSTRUMENT OVER\\-IEV.\nBand\nFrequency (GHz)\nAverage Bandwidth (GHz)\n# of Polarization .\\ssemblies\n# of Temperature Anisotropy _-\\ssemblies\nFWHM Angular Resolution (arcmin)\nField of Vie" (0)\nl range\nInstrument Sensitivity (J.\'KS1-\'2)\n\nQ\n43.1\n7.6\n17\n2\n27.3\n7.0\n:::::: 25-475\n69\n\nw\n94.5\n10.7\n84\n6\n11.7\n8.2\n:::::: 25-975\n87\n\n3\n\nThe QUIET Instrument\nQUIET a1 the Chajnantor Plateau\n5000 ro, 273 K.

The mount control software is an aug-\n\nmented version of the CBI control system. The principal modifications included the addition of support for\nrapid scanning of the azimuth axis of the mount and for\nmonitoring and archil\'ing of data from the QUIET receiver, This software consists of a central control and\ndata collection program, a. grapbcal user interface program, a real-time computer running the VxWorks27 operating system to control the telescope mount, and a\nreal-time computer running LimlX to control the receiver.\nThe mount was operated by a queue of non-interactive\nobserving scripts written in a custom control language.\nThe modifications supported high scanning accelerations\nwithout overwhelming the counter-torque ir.. the antibacklash system of the azimuth drive. Tracking accuracy is therefore sacrificed for high scanning speeds and\naccelerations . .However, accurate pointing information\ncan be reconstructed during the data analysis from frequent readouts of the 3Jds encoders and a dynamic model\nof the mechanical response of the mount. To facilitate\nthiS, the CBI control system was also modified to acquire encoder readouts at 100 Hz. The modified control\nsystem supports scans with coasting speeds of up to 6\xc2\xb0 /s\nand turnaround accelerations of up to 1.5\xc2\xb0 /S2. The accuracy .of the encoder readout timestamps is ""\'0,5 ms.\nThe worst-case following error (the difference between\nthe commanded trajector and the encoder-read trajectory) were,..., 8\' at maximum acceleration during azimuth\nturn-arounds. Both the timing and the following errors\nresulted in negligible pointing eITors during the observing\nseasons (pointing accuracy is discussed further in Section 8.6). We achieved a mean azimuthal scan speed\nof ~ 5\xc2\xb0/s. The resulting scanning speed on the sky\nis elevation-dependent and corresponds to about 2\xc2\xb0 Is,\nyielding azimuth scan frequencies of 45-100 mHz. As\neach 15\xc2\xb0 x 15\xc2\xb0 observing field rises, its azimuthal extent with respect to the fixed telescope mount increases.\nAs a result, the telescope azimuth slew size increases\nfor higher elevation scans. Avoiding scanning through\nthe azimuth limit leads to an upper elevation limit; the\nmount azimuth limit is ~ 440 0 (800 past one full rotation), \\ielding an upper elevation limit of 75 0 for CMB\nscans. The lower limit of the elevation range of the mount\n27\n\nwww.windriver.com\n\nThe QUIET Collaboration\n\n4\n\nis 43\xc2\xb0.\nIn <3.,ddition to the azimuth and elevation axes, the\nmount provides a third rotation axis through the boresight. We rotate this boresight angle (\'deck angle\') once\nper week in order to separate the polarization on the sky\nfrom that induced by systematic errors such as leakage\nfrom temperature to polarization.\n3. OPTICS\n\nThe optical chain consists of a classical side-fed Dragonian antenna (Dragone 1978) coupled to a platelet array of diffusion-bonded corrugated feed horns cooled to\n\'" 20 K (\'" 27 K) inside the Q-band (W-band) cryostat. The outputs of these optical elements are directed\ninto the polarimeter and differential-temperature assemblies described in Sections 5.1 and 5.3, respectively. The\nmain reflector (MR) and sub-reflector (SR) as well as\nthe aperture of the cryostat are enclosed by an ambient\ntemperature (\'" 270 K), absorbing ground screen. The\ndesign and characterization of the telescope, feed horns\nand ground screen are described in Sections 3.1, 3.2, and\n3.3, respectively. The optical performance, as measured\nby the main beam, the sidelobes and the instrumental\npolarization, is described in Sections 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6,\nrespectively.\n\nTABLE 3\nTELESCOPE DESIGN PARAMETERS\n\ndescription, parameter\nMR circular aperture diameter, D\nSR edge L.,\nMR-SR separation, i\nl\\!R offset L., eo\nL. betv:een lvlR and horn axes, eo\n\ndesign/actual ,alue\n1470/1400 mm\n17\xc2\xb0/20\xc2\xb0\n1270 mm\n-53\xc2\xb0\n_90\xc2\xb0\ncalculated value\n~!R focal length, F\n4904.1 mm\nSR eccentricity, e\n2.244\n. -63.37\xc2\xb0\nL. between SR and MR axis, p\nSR\'interfocal distance, 2c\n6516.1 mm\nMR offset distance, do\n4890.2 mm\nNOTE. - The design values in the top half of the table\nwere used to establish the calculated values in the lower\nhalf of the table. For the first two parameters, the actual\nvalues listed supersede the design values for the purpose\nof fabrication. Negative angles are measured clockwise\nwith respect to the vertical axis shown in Figure 3.\n\ne,\n\nParabolo14\n\nThe telescope design requirements include: a wide\nfield of view, excellent polarization characteristics, minimal beam distortion, minimal instrumental polarizado!l,\nminimal spillover, and low sidelobes that could otherwise generate spurious polarization. The latter requirements have often been met by CMB experiments by using either classical, dual oEset Cassegrain antennas (e.g.,\nBarkats et al. 2005), Gregorian antennas (e.g., Meinhold\net al. 1993), or shaped reflectors (e.g., Page et al. 2003b).\nQUIET is the first C~IB polarization experiment to take\nadvantage of the wide field of view enabled by a classical Dragonian antenna (Imbriale et al. 2011). Ar, additional advantage of the classical Dragonian antenna\nis that it satisfies the Mizuguchi condition (1-fizugutch\net al. 1976) which, when combined with the very low\ncross-polar characteristics of the conical corrugated feed\nhorns l yields yery low antenna contribution to the instrumental polarization. As pointed out by Chang &\nPrata (2004) , a classical Dragonian antenna affords two\nnatural geometries, a front-fed design and a side-fed (or\ncrossed) design. QUIET uses the side-fed design because\nit allows for the use of a larger cryostat, and hence focal\nplane array, without obstructing the beam.\n3.1.1. Telescope Design\n\nThe design of the refie\xc2\xabtors follows the procedure outlined by Chang & Prata (2004) and is augmented wi:h\na physical optics program (Imbriale & Hodges 1991) to\npredict beam patterns. This procedure relies on the specification of the first five design parameters given in the\ntop half of Table 3 and shown in Figure 3. Once these\nparameters are specified, a number of other useful parameters can be calculated including the ~!R focal length\nand the SR eccentricity, and these are listed in the IOYler\nhalf of Table 3.

Table 3\nprovide, a description of each parameter and their values,\n\nyalue in Table 3. Similarly, the actual SR circular diameter was increased slightly, also to 1400 mm, and this\nresulted in an increased value of the actual SR edge angle\ngiven by 20\xc2\xb0 in Table 3. The oversized SR reduces feed\nspillover for the horns on the edge of the array. The design values (not the actual values) shown in the top half\nof Table 3 were used to establish the calculated ,."Iues\nshown in the lower half of Table 3.\n3.1.2. Telescope Fabrication and Alignment\n\nThe telescope consists of two reflectors, the receiver\ncryostat (Figure 1(a)) and the structure that supports\nthem (the \'sled\'). The reflectors are machined from solid\npieces of aluminum 6061-T6, light-weighted on the reverse side leaving narrow ribs on a triangular grid, and\nattached V"ith adjustable hexapod struts to the sled. The\nsled in turn is mounted on a deck structure (Figure l{b)),\nwhich also supports the ground screen, the recejver electronics enclosure, the telescope drive crates, the uninter-\n\nThe QUIET Inst rument\n\n5\n\nTABLE 4\nPLATELET A RRAY DESIGN PARAMETERS\n\nFrequencv\n(bar.d/GHz)\nQ/39-47\nW/89-100\n\n# of\nFeeds\n19\n91\n\nLx\\VxH\n(mm x mm x mm)\n281.7x427.3x370.1\n129.1x427.8x370.5\n\nAperture\n\nThroat\n\nDiameter\n\nDiameter\n\nGrooves\n\n43.7\n20.6\n\n(mm)\n71.78\n31.62\n\n(mm)\n6.69\n2.97\n\n104\n103\n\nruptable power supply, and the expanded steel walkways.\nThe deck is attached directly to the deck bearing.\nAfter the fabrication of the reflectors and sled, the telescope was assembled and pre-aligned using a UetricVision ~1V200 laser radar. This system was used to measure both the reflector surfaces as weil as the absolute\npositions of tooling balls on the perimeter of each reflec\xc2\xb7\ntor once the reflectors were aHgned to the focal plane.\nThe rms deviations from the ~IR and SR design surfaces\nare 38 Jjrn and 28\n\n\xc2\xab\n\nj.tID,\n\n#\n\nMass\n(kg)\n\nrespectively, once a small fraction\n\n1%) of the outlier measurements from the perimeter\n\nof each reflector are removed.\n\nIn order to aliga the reflectors after asse:nbling them\nat the site, an animated 3-D model of the telescope was\nconstructed which also accounted for additional tooling\nballs on the cryostat face. These tooling ball. have well\nmeasured displacements from the platelet array. \\\';sing\nthe model, a transformation matrix was established that\n\nmapped turnbuckie adjustments to tooling ball displace-.\nments for each reflector (Monsalve 2012). After assembly at the Site, the distances between the tooling balls\nwere measured with a custom-built vernier caliper with\na range of 2.4 m. The transformation matrix was inverted and applied to the tooling ball displacements in\norder to establish the proper turnbuckle adjustments .\nThe ~urnbuckles were then adjusted to bring the system\ninto alignment. This method. enabled com-ergence to an\naligned state after just three iterations. The 17 measurements used to establish the position of the SR with\nrespect to the cryostat (for both the Q- and W-band systems) yielded an rms error of < 400 pm when compared\nto the ideal positioning_ Similarly the 14 meaaurements\nused to establish the pos!tion of the !.IR with respect to\nthe sa yielded an rms error of < 500 pm when compared to the ideal positioning as established using the\nIMer radar. Tolerance studies allowing for comparable\ndisplacements show that this level of alignment error has\nminimal impact on the optical performance.\n3.2. Feed Horns\nThe requirements for the feed horns include high beam\nsymmetry, efficiency, gain and bandwidth, as well as\nlow sidelobes and c~oss-polarization_ These requirements\nare satisfied by conical, corrugated feed horns (Kay\n1962; Ciarricoats & Olver 1984). Standard production\ntechniques for corrugated feed horns (e.g. computernumerically-controlled lathe machining and electroforming) are prohibitivelv costly for the large number of feeds\nfor the W-band array. A lower-cost option is described\nin the next subsection.\n3.2.1. Platelet Array Design\n\nA 91-element W-band and a 19-element Q-band\nplatelet array of hexagonally-packed, conical, corrugated\n\nof\n\nHorn\nSeparation\n\'(mm)\n76.20\n35.56\n\nSemi-flare\n\nAngle\n(degrees)\n7.6"\n7.6"\n\nfeed horns were designed for QUIET (Gundersen & Wollack 2009; Imbriale et al. 2011). Each array is machined\nfrom aluminum 6061-T6 and consists of a number of thin\nplatelets each with a single corrugation, a number of\nthick plates each with multiple corrugations, and a base\nplate. The assembly of platelets and plates is then diffusion bonded together. Table 4 provides the parameters\nof each array.\nDue to the side-fed geometry of the telescope, the feed\nhorns must have relatively high gain (0: 27 to 28 dB) in\norder to provide a low edge taper of ~ -30 dB for both\nt he Q and W-band systems. This dictates the aperture\nsize of the feed horns and hence the horn-to-horn spacing. For the W-band horns, this spacing is commensurate\nwith the size of the modules. Most of the dimensions of\nthe Q-band horns are scaled by the ratio of the frequenCies (~ 90/40 = 2.25) which results in a Q-band horn\nspacing that is larger than the Q-band modules. These\nhorn spacings give rise to angular separations of 1.75\xc2\xb0\n(0.82\xc2\xb0) between adjacent beams in the Q (W) systems\nand result in fields of view of 7.0\' and 8.2" for the Q and\nW systems, respectively.\nThe number of corrugations is fixed. at three per y:avelength for each horn and a semi-flare angle of 7.6\xc2\xb0 is\nchosen using a design procedure that ensures both acceptable cross-polar levels and return loss (Hoppe 1987,\n1988). This optimization procedure also adjusts the\ndepth of the first six corrugations of each horn in order to\nreduce the predicted reflection coefficient to better thaI!\n-32 dB over the full anticipated band of operation.\n3.2.2. Platelet Army Testing\n\nA vector network analyzer (VNA) was used to measure\nthe return loss of each horn in each array. Each measurement consisted of attaching one horr. in a platelet array\nto one port of the VN A using a commercially available\ncircular-to-rectangular transition. A sheet of microwaye\nabsorber was placed at 45 0 in front of the horns at a\ndistance of ~ 1 m. The return losses for five of the 19\nQ-band horns are shown in Figure 4 and are similar for\nthe W-band feed horns. ~laximum reflection strengths\n(negative return loss) are listed in Table 5. For comparison, individual electroformed horns that are identical in\ndesign to the Q and W-band horns were fabricated. The\narray values in Thble 5 are comparable to but not quite\nas good as the electroformed horns or the theoretical predictions both of which were < -30 dB across the band.\nBeam patterns were measured for all 91 hor"" in the\nW-band array and 13 out of 19 horns in the Q-band array. A synthesizer combined with x3 and x6 multipliers\ngenerated the source signals at 40 and 90 G Hz respectively. A standard gain harr. was used as a source antenna. The platelet arrays were mounted on an azimuthelevation mount so that the source waa in the far-field of\n\nThe QUIET Collaboration\nTABLE 5\nI\\lEASURED PLATELET ARRAY PERFORMANCE\n\n(band/GHz)\n\nFWH11\n(deg)\n\nGain\n(dB)\n\nQ/39-47\nW/89-100\n\n8.3-6.9\n8.3-7.4\n\n27.2-28.5\n27.1-28.0\n\nFrequency\n\nCrosspol\nE/H\n(dB)\n< -34/ - 29\n< -31/ - 29\n\nReflection\nStrength\n(dB)\n< -25\n< -24\n\nInsertion\nLoss\n\n(dB)\n\n< -0.1\n< -0.1\n\nI\n\n~~vY7\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nFrequency (GJh)\nFIG. 4.- Return loss measurements for five of the 19\nhorns.\n\n,.\nQ~band\n\nthe platelet array horns. The source signals were modulated at 1 kHz and a lock-in amplifier connected to a\ndetector diode on the platelet array detected the signal.\nA coalignecl, alignment laser ensured that the source horn\nand platelet array horn were parallel and axially ali\xe2\x82\xac:,ned\nto each other. A digital protractor with an accuracy of\n\xc2\xb1O.05\xc2\xb0 ensured that the source and receiver horn \'s po-\n\nlarization axes were coincident ,for the capolar patterns\nor perpendicular to each other for the crosspolar patterns. Several measurements were made on each horn\nincluding E- and H-plane copalar patterns as well as\ntheir corresponding crosspolar patterns. The patterns\nwere taken by keepbg the source horn static and rotating the platelet array horn b azimuth about a yertical\naxis that intersected the horns phase center. A detailed\ndescription of this procedure is given in Clarricoats &\nOlver (1984).\nThe beam patterns of typical Q-band and W-band\nhorns are shown in Figure 5. This figure shows both Eand H-plane copolar patterns as well as crosspolar patterns for the platelet feeds and for an electroformed feed\nwith identical design parameters. The figure also shows\nthe theoretical model responses. In all cases the E- and\nH-plane copolar patterns are consistent with both the\nmodel and. the electroformed feed measurements out to\nthe -30 dB level. Upper limits of -34 (-31) dB are set\non the E-plane crosspolar levels for Q-band (W-band).\nThe H-plane crosspolar patterns are r:.ot in as good agreement with the model, which predicts both E- and H-plane\ncrosspolar levels at the < -40 dB level. The largest discrepancies are similar in shape to the Q-band H-plane\ncrosspolar measurements shown in Figure 5 and have a\nnon-null crosspolar boresight response. This type of response is typical of angular misalignment between the\nsource and receiver probes, and the level of the response\nis consistent with the precision of the digital level. The\nW -band H -plane crosspolar response does have a null\non boresight and is likely the true crosspolar response.\nThe fact that the platelet arrays\' crosspolar responses are\nconsistently higher than the corresponding electroformed\n\n--\n\n-\n\n~~~~.5~~~~~~~.5~~~\n\nFIG. 5.- Bea.."TI pattern measurements of a typical Q-band (Vlband) horn in each platelet array along with an electroformed\nequivalent horn are shown in the top (bottom) two figures. The\nleft-hand subfigures show the E-plane results and the right-hand\nsubfigures show the H-plane results. The solid line in each case\nshows the theoretical prediction of the copolar responses. The theoretical predictions of the crosspolar responses are all below -40\ndB and are not shown. Upper limits of -34 (-31) dB are placed\non the E-plane crosspolar responses for Q-band (W-band). The\nH-plane crosspolar responses are measured at the -30 to -33 dB\nlevel for both Q and W-band platelet array horns as well as for\ntheir electroform.ed equivalents.\n\nhorns\' responses suggests that either the machining or\nthe diffusion bonding process leads to somewhat compromised performance. However, none of the measured\nfeeds has crosspolar levels> -29 dB. Table 5 summarizes the results of the beam pattern measurements.\nUpper limits on the insertion loss were obtained during\nthe return loss measurements of both the W-band and\nQ-band platelet arrays by placing a flat aluminum plate\nin front of the horn and generating an effective short.\nIn both cases the measured reflection strength allows a\nlower bound to be set on the feeds\' room temperature\ntransmission efficiency of > 99%. Assuming solely ohmic\nlosses, this transmission efficiency is expected to increase\nto> 99.5% upon cooling to 25 K as the electrical resistivity of the horns decreases with temperature (Clark et al.\n1970).\n\n3.3. Ground Screen\nThe side-fed Dragone design minimizes but does not\neliminate sidelobe power. Simulations show that a number of sidelobes are expected. The performance of the\nground screens is described in detail in Section 3.5. In\norder to minimize the radiation from the ground and\nfrom celestial sources entering the receiver through sidelobes, an absorbing, comoving ground screen is emploved.\nThis shields the instrument from va.rying ground and Sun\npick-up and provides a stable, essentially unpolarized\n\nThe QUIET Instrument\n\xe2\x82\xacIIllSSlOn source that does not \'\\-ary during a telescope\n\nscan. The ground screen structure (Figure l(b)) consists\nof two parts: the low\'er ground screen is an aluminum\nbox that encloses both reflectors and the front half of\nthe crj\xc2\xb7ostat; the upper ground screen (UGS) is a cylindrical tube that attaches to the lower ground scree:! directly above the tlR. The external surface ofthe ground\nscreen is coated in white paint in order to reduce diurnal\ntemperature yariations and to minimize radiative loading. Following the approach used by the BICEP experiment (Takahashi 2007), the interior of the ground screen\nis coated with a broadband absorber 28 that absorbs radiation and re-emits it at a constant temperature, allowing the ground screen to function as\xc2\xb7 an approximately\nconstant Rayleigh-Jeans source in both Q and W bands.\nThe UGS was not in place for the Q-band measurement.\nIt was installed in January 2010, approximately a third\nof the way through the W-band season.\n\n3.4. Main Beam Performance\nThe main beam profiles are primarily determined from\nobservations of Jupite!". Additional observations of Taurus A (hereafter Tau A) are performed to check the main\nlobe response, to measure the polarized responsivity, to\ndetermine the polarization angles and to characterize instramental polarization. Tau A and Jupiter are used for\nmain beam characterization since they are, respectively,\nthe brightest polarized and unpolarized, compact sources\nin the sky. Figure 6 shows beam patterns of Jupiter\nfor a differential-temperature assembly in each of the Q\nand V\\~-band arrays. These measurements are consistent\nwith the lower signal-to-noise main beam profiles measured using Tau A once the\xc2\xb7 slightly different instrumental bandpasses, source spectra, and positions in the focal\nplane are taken into account. The main beam is used to\ncompute the main beam solid angle OB, the main beam\nforward gain, Grn = 41r lOB, and the telescope sensitiyity,\n\n10-2o c 2\n\nr = 2k\n\n2Q\nBVe\n\nB\n\nILK Jy-l\n\n(1)\n\nin terms of the effective frequency,\nVe\n\n=\n\nJVf(v)<T(v)dv\nJ f(v)<T(v)dv\n\n(2)\n\nfor a given instr\'J.mental bandpass f(v) and source spectrum <T(v).

The corresponding azimuthally-averaged beam\nprofiles for each map are shown On the right in comparison with\nthe theoretical prediction (solid line). Similar maps and profiles of\nTau A were measured using the polarimeter assemblies but at a\nreduced signal-to-noise.\n\nSimilarly a source spectrum of the form\n\n(4)\nis used to compute the effective frequency for unresolved\nCl\\JB fluctuations, where x = hv/ kaTCMB.\nTable 6 provides a summary of the mean values of these\nquantities for the Q-band and W-band polarization and\ntotal-power modules for a source spectrum of the form\ngiven in Equation 4. The Q-band total power vaiues are\nfor the lone Q-band differential-temperature assembly,\nwhile the Q-band polarization values are for the central\npixel which is typical for the array. Both the W-band\ntotal power and polarization ,-alues shown in Table 6\nare averaged over the respective differential-temperature\nand polarization array elements using an inverse-variance\nweighting.\nThe shape of the main beam and its uncertainties are\nused to compute the instrumental window function and\nits associated uncertainties (Illonsalve 2010). Initially,\nan arbitrarily oriented, 2-D, elliptical gaussian beam is\nfit to the data shown in Figure 6. If aa and Ub represent the beam widths of the semi-major and semi-minor\naxes of the ellipticai gaussian (with <Ta ::> <Tb), then the\nelongation is defined by , = (<T a - <Tb) / (<T a + <Tb). Typical\nelongations were found to be < 0.02 and averaged about\n0.01. This low elongation, and the fact that the CMB\nscans use a combination of natural sky rotation and deck\nangle rotation, imply that the beams are well described\nby an axially-symmetric beam. The symmetrized beam\nis is expressed as a Hermite expansion (Monsalve 2010),\nand this expansion is used to compute the transfer function and covariance matrix (Page et al. 2003a).\n\n8\n\nThe QUIET Collaboration\nTABLE 6\nMAIN BEAM PERFOR.UANCE PARAMETERS\n\nGm\nr\nF:HU OB\ndeg)\n(GHz)\n(I\'s~) (dBi) (I\'K Jy-l )\n43.0\n0.455\n74.3\nQp\n52.3\n237\n0.456\n78.0\n52.1\n43.4\n222\nQT\nWF\n94.4\n0.195\n13.6\n59.6\n269\n\xc2\xb715.6\n95.7\n0.204\n59.1\n228\nWT\nNOTE. - Mean effective frequencies, Fv\\~11 beam\nsizes, main beam solid angles, main beam forward gains\nand telescope sensitivities for both the polarization (subscript P) and differential-temperature (subscript T) assemblies assuming a C1-IB-like, broadband source with a\nspectrum given by Equation 4.\nVe\n\n~\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n~\n\nSidelC)bes at 40 Glb:\n\n!~~----+==----.-~----~----~c-.~--+------~\n~\n\n~~I--.A~~--+--11\n.!!\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nIi -811 PI~--c\'-ll!--\n\n~\n\n~\n~\n\n3.5. Sidelobe Characterization\nTwo different methods are used to measure sidelobes.\nThese included pre-deployment anter..na range measurements and in-situ measurements of a bright, near-field\nsource.

Antenna R(mge Measurements of Sidelobes\n\nThe telescope was installed on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\'s Mesa Antenna :Measurement Facility for measurements of both the main lobe and far sidelobes at\nboth 40 and 90 GHz. The telescope was mounted on\nan elevation-over-azimuth positioner with 4" pointing accuracy. Individual electroformed versions of the Q and\nW-band horns, described in Section 3.2.2, were used for\nthe range measurements. The range measurements were\nconducted before the ground screens were fabricated, so\nthe sidelobe results are only appropriate for the telescope\nin its bare configuration. The measurements made use\nof the facility\'s Scientific Atlar.ta model 1797 heterodyne\nreceiver system which enabled repeatable measurements\ndovln to -90 dB of the peak power level. A combination of a source synthesizer, multiplier and amplifier was\nused to generate"" 100 - 200 m W of power at each frequency. The sources were separately connected to corrugated feeds at the focus of a small cassegrain antenna at a\ndistance of 914 m from the telescope. Due to limitations\nof the mount, only a simple principal plane cut within\n\xc2\xb190\' of the telescope boresight (in the plane shown in\nFigure 3) was performed for a number of arrangements\nof the source/receiver antennas. These arrangements inCluded moving the receiver horn to a few positions in the\nfocal plane and rotating the source and receiver horns for\nboth E- and H-plane cuts.\nThe results for one feed horn position for each of the\nQ- and W-band arrays are shown in Figure 7. In each\ncase the feed horn position that was tested corresponds\nto the top row of the respective platelet array, furthest\nfrom the l\\IR and directly above the central feed horn.\nCross polar measurements were not made on the antenna\nrange since they are made during routine calibrations.\nThe main lobe beamsizes compare well wi!;h initial theoretical predictions (Imbriale et al. 2011); however, the\nnear-b (i.e., within \xc2\xb15\xc2\xb0 of the main lobe) sidelobe lev-\n\n-60\n\n-30\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\nAngle from boresight to source (degrees)\nFIG. 7.- Results from the antenna range measurements with no\nground screens ~n place. The top measurements are the 40 GHz\nE-plane results for a horn located in the top row, 20.46 mm above\nthe central horn. The bottom measurements are the 90 GHz Hplane result::> for a horn located in the top row, 23.87 mm above\nthe central horn. The gap in the measurements fro:n boresight\nangles of +1.5\xc2\xb0 to +8.5\xc2\xb0 is due to mount-related elevation angle\nlimitations. The two most prominent far sidelobes are the triple\nreflection sidelobe and the SR spillover lobe as indicated in each\nfigure. The optical patbs associated. with these lobes are shown in\nFigure 9. Top row horns, such as thl:se, are most susceptible to\neach of these lobes due to their location in the focal plane.\n\nels do not. As described by 1mbriale et al. (2011), this\nis due to the reflector surface imperfections, which were\nnot included in the initial theoretical predictions. As\nshown in Figure 18 from Imbriale et al. (2011), once the\nmeasured reflector surface is incorporated in the theoretical pattern predictions, the predicted envelope of near-in\nsidelobes matches well with the observations. The surface imperfections caused the near-in sidelobe levels to\nincrease by as much as 15 dB in some regions. The two\ndominant far sidelobes are the SR spillover lobe and the\n\'triple reflection\' lobe. The SR spillover lobe is broad\nand arises from direct coupling into the feed horn. It is\nlocated ~ 70\' from boresight as predicted by Imbriale\net al. (2011). The triple reflection lobe is due to an additional reflection off the SR (as indicated in Figure 9)\nand it is located ~ 50\xc2\xb0 from boresight in the opposite\ndirection from the SR spillover lobe. This position also\nmatches the prediction shown in Figure 10 of Imbriale\net al. (2011). The amplitude of each lobe for the W-band\ncase is -60 to -62 dB, while they are -5~ to -59 dB for\nthe Q-band measurement. These amplitudes are both\n5-7 dB above the uncorrected predictions of Imbriale\net al. (2011). As with the increased near-in sidelobe levels, this increase in the far sidelobes can be attributed to\n\nThe QUIET Instrument\n\n9\n-60\n\n.,\n.,\n..,\n\'"\nIII\n\nI!!\n0::\n\n0\n\niii\n~\n\njjj\n\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n80\n70\n60\nSO\n40\n80\n70\n60\nSO\n40\n-200\n\n~\n.,\nE\n\nI!!\n::J\n\n-75\n\n.\n\n:~..\n\n.\n\n.\'.\n\n.\n\n." - tIf\'"\n\'~";y\'\n~\n\n.\n\n"\n\n....\n\n. .. \'-\n\n.\n.\n\n.\n\n\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n.\nB\n.\n.s\n.,\nIII\n\nE\n0::\n0::\n\n-90\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0::\n\n..,\n.,\niii\nu\n\n.$\n\n..,\nIII\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nAzimuth (degrees)\nFIG. 8.- Sidelobe measurements for W-band module 40, located on the edge of the array, with the deck angle set at -180\xc2\xb0 and the\nnear-field source located at an azimuth of ::::: 20\xc2\xb0 and an elevation of ~ -5\xc2\xb0, top: Measurements with only the lower ground screen.\nThe lobe seen at the bottom of the map is from spillover Fast the SR.

The UGS reduces the far sidelobes by at least an additional 20 dB below the levels shown in Figure 7.\n\nreflector surface imperfections.\n3.5.2. Source Measurements of Sidelobes\n\nThe performance of the VGS was assessed using the Wband array in 2010 January. For these measurements, a\npolarized, modulated 92 GHz osc:Jlator was placed in the\nnear field of the telescope at a distance of approximately\n15 m. The telescope was scanned over its entire azi:r.:1Uth\nand elevation range at four different deck anglelS (0\xc2\xb0 , 90\xc2\xb0 ,\n-90\xc2\xb0, -180\xc2\xb0). The top and middle panels in Figue 8\nshow measurements before and after the installation of\nthe VGS, respectively. The :rr..ain sidelobe feature at the\nbottom of the top map corresponds to the line-of-sight\nover the SR. This feature is clearly removed by the L\'GS.\nThe remaining sidelobes were caused by holes in the floor\nof the lower ground screen below the SR. A third measurement taken after placing absorber over these holes\n(bottom panel in Figure 8) verifies this and displays the\nsidelobe performance in the final ground screen configuratiorr. The UGS was not in place during any or the\nQ-band observing season nor during the first third of the\nW-band observing season.\n3.5.3. Sun Measurements of Sidelobes\n\nBefore the installation of the UGS, the sun was occasionally detected in the sidelobes. This is particularly\napparent once the data are binned into maps in \'telescope\nboresight-centered\' coordinates (Chinone 2011). The\ncartesian basis of this coordinate system has i oriented\nalong the feed horn boresight, k oriented along the tele\xc2\xb7\nscope boresight, and 3= k x i. If s is directed toward the\nsun, the corresponding spherical coordinates of the sun\nare defined to be = cos-\'(s.k), and \xc2\xa2 = tan-\' (s-3 /s.1).\nFigure 9a shows the optical path of these sidelobes be\xc2\xb7\nfore the installation of the UGS. Figure 9b shows the\ntelescope boresight-centered map for a feed horn on the\n\ne\n\ntop row of the Q-band array that is closest to the vertical centerline of the platelet array. The direction of the\ntriple reflection far sidelobe is similar among feed horns.\nHowever, the direction of the spillover far sidelobe is different among feed horns because it couples directly to the\nfeed horns and not t:3.rough the reflectors. Therefore the\nfar sidelobe response is characterized for each feed horn\nseparately. The far sidelobes for W-band were also measured before and after the UGS installation (Figures 9c\nand 9d). Figure 9d confirms that both far sidelobes are\neliminated by the UGS. The \xc2\xa2 = 0\' -180\xc2\xb0 horizontal line\nin Figure 9 corresponds to the principal plane measurement shown in Figure 7, and both show the SR spillover\nlobe and triple reflection lobe before the installation of\nthe VGS. The amplitudes of the two far sidelobes measured with the sun are consistent v,~ith the "-\' -60 dB\nlevels obtained with the range measurements shown in\nFigure 7. Data with the moon or sun in the sidelo bes\nwere excised in the Q\xc2\xb7band analysis (QUIET Collaboration et al. 2011) as well as during the first third of the\nW\xc2\xb7band season (in preparation). The addition uf the\nUGS for the W-band data, in combination \\7ith azimuth\nfiltering and data rejection used for the Q-band data,\nmakes the spurious polarization signal due to sidelobes a\nnegligible effect on the B-mode measurements.\n3.6. Leakage Beams\nThe leakage beams quantify both the Q and U detector\ndiodes,29 responses to an unpolarized source, as well as\nthe leakage that can convert a sky Q into a measured V or\na sk~r V into a measured Q. In order to assess these various forms of leakage, daily observations of Jupiter and/or\nTau A were performed. These produce beam maps that\nare subsequently decomposed into their respective beam\nl\\luelier fields following O\'Dea et al. (2007).

Figure 10 shows the results of this extraction of the leakage\nand oderized beams for a Q and U diode pair behind the\ncentral W-band horn.

Instrumental polarization can be generated by\nany of the elements in the optical path including the\nreflectors, the curved cryostat window, the IR blocker,\nthe feed horns, the septum polarizers and the modules\nthemselves. In the Appendix, specific expressions are\nderived for these leakage terms for the modules and the\nseptum polarizers. These two ele:rr::.ents are the primary\ncause of the monopole leakage contribution to the mQI\nand mUI Mueller fields. The median W-band monopole\nleakage is 0.25% and is lower than the median Q-band\nmonopole leakage. These Q and W -band leakages measured with Jupiter and Tau A are consistent with those\nobtained from skydip measurements that are described in\nSection 8.4. As reported in QUIET Collaboration et aI.\n(2011), the Q-band monopole leakage is the largest systematic error in the B-mode measurement at \xc2\xa3\n100\nwhere it begins to dominate the constraint on T at levels of T < 0.1. A na lye estimate of the impact of this\nleakage would cause it to dominate at a much higher\nlevel; however, a combination of sky rota"!;ion and .frequent boresight rotation suppresses this systematic by\nsome two orders of magnitude. The origins of the Qband monopole leakage are described in more detail in\nSection 5.l.\nThe monopole leakage refers to the SOD term in the\nGauss-Hermite expansion of these leakage beams given\nby b1oak(X, y) (Monsalve 2010). Here and in Figure 10 the\ncoordinates (x = sinBsin\xc2\xa2,y = sin Bcos \xc2\xa2) are telescope\nbOrE3sight-centered coordinates defined in Section 3.5.3.\nf",J\n\nThe QUIET Collaboration\n\n12\n\nof single-yalued detector angles, 1."Q and 1/Ju and are not\n\nThe leakage beams can be expressed as\n2\n\na source of systematic error.

The full array drift scans of Jupiter are particularly useful in measuring these quantities for every diode\nin the W-band array. Histograms of the peak amplitudes complete to i = j = 2 are shown in Figure 11 for\nthe W-band array. (Similar results are provided for the\ncentra! pixel of the Q-band alTay in Monsalve (2010).)\nAdditional terms in the expansion are also included, but\nthey are consistently less than 0.1%. Leakages above 1%\nare quite rare and typical values are in the 0.2 - 0.4%\nrange. The W-band dipole and quadrupole leakages are\ntypicaily slightly higher than those in Q-band. The systematic effects that these leakage beams \xc2\xb7 generate for\npower spectrum estimation are provided for tile Q- band\nresults (QUIET Collaboration et at. 2011) ar.d in tbe Wband analysis (QUIET Collaboration 2012).\nThe mUQ and mQu Mueller fields measure the leakage\nof the incident Q Stokes parameter into the measured\nU Stokes parameter or the incident U Stokes parametec\ninto the measured Q Stokes parameter. Curved reflector\nsurfaces, imperfect ions in the septum polarizer, and imperfections in the phase switch are potential sources of\nthis leakage. These primarHy give rise to monopole leakage and effectively rotate the instrumental position angle.\nIn tbe case that tbe ratios mQu/mQQ and mUQ/muu\nare constant over the extent of the beam, the mUQ and\nmQu Mueller fields can be absorbed into the expressions\nfor the two diode outputs with the definition of detector\nangles .,pQ and \'I/Ju. The detector angles are defined by\nreplacing the last two terms in each of equations 5 and 6\nwith a single term as follows:\npmQQ cos(2[\'YPA\n\n-.,p - .!)Q]) ==\n.,p]) + P mQu sin(2(\'YPA - .,p])\n\np mQQ cos(2[\'YPA -\n\n4.1. Cryostat Design\nThe Q-band and W-band receiver arrays each has\na dedicated cr;\'ostat (Figure 12). In each cryostat,\ncryogenic temperatures are achieved with two GiffordMcl>lahon dual-stage refrigerators. The first stage of the\nrefrigerators provide cooling power to a radiation shield,\nmaintained at ~ 50 K (~ 80 K) for the Q-band (W-band)\ncryostat. ThE\' difference in shield temperature between\nthe W-bar:d and Q-band instruments was not anticipated\nfrom the cryostat design, but altimately did not greatly\nimpact the module temperatures. Infrared radiation is\nreduced with 10 cm trJck, 31b density polystyrene foam\n(Table 7) attached to the top of the radiation shield.\nTbe first stages of the refrigerators also provide a thermal break for the electrical cables. Tbe second stages of\nthe refrigerators provide cooling power for the feed horn\narray and the modules. The two stages are thermally\nisolated by G-10 rings.\n\n4.2. Cryostat Performance\nThe cryogenic performance of the Q- band array is consistent with the design goals of (i) 20 K module temperatures and (ii) tbat the.module temperatures remain\nconstant during a scan to within \xc2\xb1O.l K . A temperature\nsensor located on an edge module in the Q-band cryostat\nhad a mean temperature of 20.0 K with a standard deviation of 0.3 K throughout tbe season and a deviation of\n0.02 K within a scan.\nFor the W-band array, additional heat loads from the\nactive components and conduction through cabling from\na factor of five more modules contribute to slightly higher\nmodule temperatures compared with tbe Q-band array.\nTaking this into consideration, the W-band modules were\nstill warmer than expected by ~ 3 K, likely as a result\nof both higher shield temperatures and a minor vacuum\n\n(9)\n\nand\n\npmUu sin(2[\'IPA -.,p - .,pu]) E\n(10)\npmuu sin(2hPA -.,p]) + pmuQ cos(2hPA - .,pl),\nrespectively. A Hermite decomposition of the nlQU and\nmUQ Mueller fields shown in Figure 10 shows tbat ther\nare simply related by a multiplicative factor to the ffiQQ\nand mm: fields. Thus they can be represented in terms\n\nFIG. 12.- The W-band cryostat with the ... acuum shell and radiation shields removed.\n\nThe QUIET Instrument\nleak. A temperature sensor placed directly on the central polarimeter of the W-band array had a mean temperature of 27.4 K with a standard de\':iation of 1.0 K\nthroughout the season, and a mean yariation within a\nscan of 0.12 K. For each receiver array, both the variation\nof the module temperatures within a scan and throughout the season had a negligible impact on the responsivity\n(QUIET Collaboration et al. 2011).\n\n4.3. The Cryostat Window\nThe vaCU:lm windows for tCle Q-band and W-band\ncryostats are each 56 em in diameter, the largest yacuum window to date for any GMB experiment. The vacuum v;rindows must he strong enough to withstand atmospheric pressure while maximizing transmission of signal\nand minimizing instrumental polarization.\nUltra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) was chosen as the window material after stresstesting a variety of window materials and thicknesses.\nThe iEdex of refraction was expected to be 1.52 (Lamb\n1996). To make a well-matc.lled anti-reflection coating\nfor the UH1IW-PE in the QUIET frequency bands, the\nwindow was coated with expanded teflon, which has an\nindex of refraction of 1.2 (Benford et al. 2003). The teflon\nwas adhered to the UH1IW-PE window by placing an\nintermediate layer of low-density polyethylene (LD-PE)\nbetween the teflon and the UHMW-PE. The plast:cs were\nCleated above the melting point of LD-PE while applying\npressure with a clamping apparatus in a vacuum chamber\nto avoid trapping air bubbles between the material layers (the window material properties are summarized in\nTable 7). The band-averaged transmission was expected\nto improve from 90% to 99% for the Q-band array and\nfrom 91% to 98% for the W-band array by adding this\nanti-reflection coating to the windows.\nAn a.nti-reflection coated sa.."TIple for the W-band window v:as measured using a VNA. The envelope of the\ntransmission a!ld reflection response were fit to obtain\nvalues for the optical properties and material thicknesses.\nThe expected contributions to the system noise from\nloss were computed using published loss tangent values\n(Lamb 1996): ~ 3K (~ 4K) for the Q-band (W-band)\nwindoNs. These values were confirmed within\n1 K by\nplacing a. second window over the main receiver window\nand measuring the change in instrument noise.\nf"V\n\n13\n\nsis (GRASP)3l package to investigate the effect of the\ncurved surface on the transmission properties of the window. For these simulations we use a window curvature\ndetermined from measurements of the deflection of the\nwindov.r under vaCUillIl,\n7.5 em. vVith a curved window! the central feed horn has negligible instrumental\npolarization. The edge pixel has 0.16% additional crosspolarization, y,rhere this is defined as leakage from one\nlinear polarization state into the other linear polarization state. This -28 dB cross-polarization is of the same\norder as expected cross-polarization from the horns alone\nand would contribute indirectly to the cross polarization\ncoefficients mQu and mUQ given in Section 3.6.\nf\'V\n\n5. QUIET POLARl1!ETER AND\nDIFFERENTIAL-TEMPERATURE ASSEMBLIES\n\nQUIET uses HEMT-based low-noise amplifiers\n(\'LNAs\') with phase sensitive techniques, following the\ntradition of recent polarization-sensitive experiments\nsuch as DASI (Leitcb et al. 2002), CBI (Padin et al.\n2002), W1IAP (Jarosik et al. 2003a), C01!PASS (Farese\net al. 2004), and PIQUE and CAP1IAP (Barkats et al.\n2005), Unlike those other experiments, however, QUIET\nuses a miniaturized design (Lawrence et al. 2004)\nsuitable for large arr~vs.\nThe QUIET Q-band (W-band) array contains 19 (90)\nassemblies, where 17 (84) are polarization-measuring assemblies. The remaining 2 (6) measure the CMB temperature anisostropy (\'differential-temperature assemblies\')\nand are described in Section 5.3. At the heart ofthese assemblies are the modules (see Section 5.2), a highly integrated package that replace many waveguide-block components with strip-line-coupled monolithic microwave integra\'ed circuit (Ml\\IIC) devices containing HEl\\ITs.\nThe modules have a footprint of 3.18cmx2.90cm (Wband) and 5.08cmx5.08cm (Q-band).

Polarimeter Assemblies\n31 http://www.ticra.com\n\n14\n\nThe QUIET Collaboration\n\nEach QUIET polarimeter assembly consists of (i) a septum polarizer, (ii) a waveguide splitter, and (iii) a module containing the highly integrated package of HEl\\ITbased ~[MIC devices (see Figure 14). The septum pDlarizer consists of a short circular-to-square transition into a\nsquare waveguide containing a septum (a thin aluminum\npiece with a stepped profile) in the center! which adds a\nphase lag to one of the propagating modes (Bornemann\n& Labay 1995). Given an incident electric field with linear orthogonal components Ex and Ey 1 where the x and\ny axis orientations are defined by the septum, the septum polarizer assembly sends a left-circularly polarized\ncomponent L = (Ex+iEy)/V\'i to one output port, and a\nright-circularly polarized component R = (Ex -iEy)/ V\'i\nto the other output port. Thus the septum\'s spatial orientation is used to define the instrumental position angle.\nThe output ports of the septum polarizer are attached to\na waveguide splitter which transitions from the narrow\nwaveguide spacing of the septum-polarizer component to\nthe wider waveguide separation of the module waveguide\ninputs. A more thorough mathematical description of\nthe septum polarizer is given in Appendix 10.3.\nThe scattering matrices, gains, and the temperatureto-pol&ization (monopole) leakage terms of both the Qband and W-band septum polarizers are derived :rom\nVNA measurements. Spectrum analrzer measureffients\nof the Q-band modules in the laboratory show a degradation in the return loss near the low frequency end of\nthe module\'s bandpass. When tills return loss plJwer\nis reflected off the septuIr.. polarizer and back into the\nmodule, it is amplified in the LNAs in the module legs\nand sent back out of the module to reflect again. This\nsets Ul) an oscillation which renders the macule incapable of measuring input signals. Therefore, a bandpass\nmismatch between the septum polarizer and module is\ndeliberately introduced to send this returr.. loss tc the\nsky and prevent\xc2\xb7 oscillations in the module output. The\nbandpass mismatch leads to a~ enhancement in the differential loss between the Ex and Ey transmissior~s at\n47 GHz, causing a temperature-to-Stokes Q leakage of ~\n1%, averaged over the module\'s bandpass. This esti!Ilate\nis consis~ent with leakage values derived from Tau A :measurements (Section 3.6). W-band VNA measurements\nshow no return loss degradation, and therefore no bandpass adjustments are needed. The VNA measurements\npredict a smaller leakage of 0.3%, so that it is subdorninant t o leakage due to optics. These measurements are\nconsiste~t wit!! monopole leakage values obtained from\non-sky calibrators (see Section 3.6 and Figure 11). Note\nthat since the optics leakage has a random direction relative to the polarimeter assembly leakage, the combined\nleakage averages to a smaller va!ue and is randomly distributed both in sign and amplitude among modules.\nf""V\n\n5.2. Modules\nThe QUIET modules are used in the polarimeter and\ndifferential-temperature assemblies (see Sections 5.1 and\n5.3), functioning as pseudo-correlation receivers so that\nthe output is a product (rather than sum or difference) of gain terms. While the modules employ a high\nspeed switching technique to reduce 1/ f noise, the:; are\nan improvement on classical Dicke-switched radiometers\n(Dicke 1946): they do not have an active switch at the\n\nWa\'le\n\nSeptum\nPolariz.er\n\nGuide\nSplitter\n\nFIG. 14.- A W-band polarimeter assembly.

A phase switch in each\nleg allows the phase to be switched between 0\' (+ 1) and\n180\' ( _1)32. The outputs of the two amplification legs\nare combined in a 180\xc2\xb0 hybrid coupler which, for voltage\ninputs a and b, produces (a + b)/V\'i and (a - b)/V\'i at\nits outputs. The hybrid coupler outputs are split, vlith\nhalf of each output power going to detector diodes D l\nand D 4 , respectively. The other halves of the output\npowers are sent to a 90\xc2\xb0 coupler which, for voltage inputs a and b, produces (a + ib) / V\'i and (a - ib) / V\'i at\nits outputs. The outputs of this 90\xc2\xb0 coupler are each\ndetected in diodes D2 and D 3, respectively. The detector diodes are operated in the square-law regime, and\nso their output ,-oltages are proportional to the squared\n32 The phase switch acts uniformly across the bandv:idth of the\nmodule.\n\nThe QUIET Instrument\n\nL\n\nR\n\n(b)\n\nan\n\nFIG. 15.- a: Signal processing schematic for\nideal module\nin a polarimeter assembly.

However\n33 When referring to diodes Dl, D2, D3, and D4, the naming\nconvention Ql, Ul, "U2. and Q2 diodes respectiyely is used,.\n\n15\n\nthe phase switches do not reverse the sign of I; therefore\nthe I output suffers from significant 1/ f noise and so is\nnot used to measure the temperature anisotropy. The\nchoice of circularly-polarized inputs thus allo\'Yo\xc2\xb7s for the\nsimultaneous measurement of both Stokes Q and U, giving an advantage in detector sensitivity oyer incoherent\ndetectors.\nThe amplifier gains and transmission coefficients are\nrepresented by the proportionality symbols in Table 8.\nIn practice, the transmission through leg B is not exactly\nidentical between the h ...ro leg B states, leading to additional free parameters needed to characterize the module.\nIf the leg B transmission differences are not accounted\nfor, they lead to instrumental (Le. false) polarization.\nThis is resolved by modulating the phase of leg A at\n50 Hz during data taking, and performing a double demodulation procedure on the offline data. Imperfections\nin the optics and the septum polarizer introduce additional offsets and terms proportional to I. These effects\nare discussed in Appendices 10.2 and 10.3.\nIn practice, the signal pseudo-correlation is implemented in a single small package as shown in Figure i5 (b)\n(Kangaslahti et al. 2006; Cleary 2010). The LNAs, phase\nswitches and hybrid couplers are all produced using the\nsame Indium-Phosphide (InP) fabrication process. Three\nLNAs, each with gain ~ 25 dB, are used in each of the\ntwo legs. When the input amplifiers are packaged in individual amplifier blocks and cryogenically cooled. to\n20 K, they exhibit noise temperatures of about 18 K (50-80 K) for the Q-band (W-band). The phase switches operate by sending the signal down one of two paths within\nthe phase switch circuit, one of which has an added\nlength of ~ (Le., 180" shift). Two InP PiN (p-doped,\nintrinsic-semiconductor, n-doped) diodes control which\npath the signal takes. The signals go through banddefining passive filters made from alumina substrates,\nand are then detected by commercially-available Schottky detector diodes downstream of the hybrid couplers.\nThe amplifers and phase switches are specific to each\nband, and hence unique to each array. The detector\ndiodes are capable of functioning at both 40 GHz and\n90 GHz, and so are identical between the two arrays.\nThe module components are packaged into clamshellstyle brass housings, precision-machined for accurate\ncomponent placement and signal routing. To provide\nbias for active components and readout of diodes, the\nhousing has feedthrough pins connecting to the module\ncomponents via microstrip lines on alumina substrates\nI"V\n\nTABLE 8\nIDEALIZED DETECTOR DIODE OUTPUTS FOR .\\ POLARIMETER\nASbEMBLY\n\nDiode\n\nD,\nD2\nD3\nD.\n\nI Raw Output I Average I Demodulated I\nex W\xc2\xb1Q)\n\nex\n\nl[\n\nex !t(I\'fU)\nex i(I\xc2\xb1U)\n\nex\n\nl[\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nex l[\n4\n\nex ~Q\nex: -~U\nex .2\nlU\n\nex: II\nex W\'fQ)\nex -~Q\n4\nN GTE. ~ Results are shown for the two states of leg\nB, with the leg A state held fixed.\n\nThe QUIET Collaboration\n\n16\n\nand w~re bonds. 11iniature absorbers and an epoxy gasket beGween the two halves of the clamshell are used to\nsuppress cross talk between the RF and DC components.\nAll Q-oand modules and roughly 10% of W-band modules were assembled by hand. For the remaining W-band\nmodules, the components and substrates were automatically placed in the housings- by a commercial contractor\nusing a pick-and-place machine; the wire bonding, absorber and epoxy gasket were then finished by hand.\n\n5.3. Differential- Tempemture AS,semblies\nThe differential-temperature assemblies are grouped\ninto pairs of assemblies, with waveguide components that\nmix t\'wo neighboring horn signals into two neighboring\nmodules. Figures 16(a) and 16(b) show the schematic\nand implementation of these assemblies. An orthomode\ntransducer (01IT) located after feedhorn A outputs the\nlinear polarizations EAx and EAy\' One of these polarizations, EAy, enters a waveguide 180 0 coupler (a "magictee") and is combined with E Bx from the adjacent feedhorn. The magic-tee outputs are coupled to a module\'s bputs. The OMTs were reused from CAP MAP\n(BarkBts et al. 2005) while the waveguide routing and\nmagic-tees were made by Custom l.Iicrowave. Note that\nthe differential-temperature assembly design resembles\nthat of WMAP (Jarosik et al. 2003b), with the significant differences being in the feed horn separaration and\nthe implementation of the LNAs. While W~IAP used a\nconservative design of discrete HEMT LNAs and waveguide components, advances in 11MIC HEMT LNAs and\nplanar circuitry enabled QUIET\'s cryogenically cooled\nintegrated array design.\nFor an ideal differential-temperature assembly, the demodulated Q diodes (D, and D 4 ) measure Elx - E~y,\nwhile their counterparts in the adjacent differentialtemperature assembly measure Ely ~ E~x\' The difference of demodulated Q diode outputs from adjacent\ndifferential-temperature assemblies measure the beamdifferenced total power (Elx + Ely) - (E~x + E~y) =\nh - IB (see Table 9). The demodulated U diodes (D2\nand D 3 ) would measure zero for an ideal assembly. However, unequal path lengths (q,) in the two legs of a module\nmix some of the temperature difference signal from the Q\ndiodes to the U diodes. The Q(U) diode signals vary as\ncos(q,)(sin(q,)). For the differential-temperature assemblies, d> is ~ 10\xc2\xb0 - 20\xc2\xb0 degrees which transfers ~ 15-30%\nof the signal to the U diodes.\nFinally, we note that the sum of demodulated Q diode\noutputs from adjacent modules is QA + QB, where Q\nTABLE 9\nIDEALIZED DETECTOR DIODE OUTPUTS FOR A\nDIFFERENTIAL-TEMPERATURE ASSEMBLY\n\nMod 1\n\nD,\nD,\n\noc Elv (E~",)\n\'"\'( E~x(El)\n\nFeedhomB\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n..........

However, as these assemblies form a small fraction of the array, the sensitivity gain is marginal and so this was not\nexplored further in the analyses.\n\n6. ELECTRONICS\n\nDownstream of the modules are electronics for detector\nbiasing, timing, preamplification, digitization, and data\ncollection. These functions are accomplished by four systems: (i) Passive Interfaces, (ii) Bias, (iii) Readout, and\n(iv) Data Management. The Passive Interfaces system\n(Section 6.1) fonns the interface between the modules,\n\nThe QUIET Instrument\n\nthe Bias system, and the Readout system. The Bias\nsystem (Section 6.2) provides the necessary bias to each\nmodule\'s active components. The Readout system (Section 6.3) amplifies and digitizes the module outputs. The\nData Hanagement system (Section 6.4) commands the\nother systems and records the data. The Bias and Readout systems are housed in a weather-proof temperaturecontrolled enclosure to protect them from the harsh conditions of the Atacama Desert. The enclosure also serves\nas a Faraday cage to minimize radio-frequency interference. Further description of these electronics can be\nfound in Bogdan et al. (2007).\nPassive Interfaces\n\nI\n\nModule Assembly Boards\nModules~\nFlexible Printed Circuits\nArray Interface Boards\n\nT\nWnther-\n\n\'roof\n\n!\n\nTlfmpt!ratureControll.cl\n\nfnclosure\n\nI\n\nReadout\n\nBias\nAmplifier BOird,\nPhi \'" Swit<;h Board.\nHouse heplnl IIoord~\n\nT\n\ni\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAmpliflers\n\n~\n\n"""\n\nMuterADC\n(4KHz,SO Hz Generiltor1\n\nI\n\nData Manapment\n\nI\n\nFIG. 17.- 11ajor components of the electronics. Boxes odline\nthe four main systems. Arrows indicate the flow of bias commands\nand data signals.\n\n6.1. Passive Interfaces\nThe electrical connection to, and protection of,\nthe modules is provided by Module Assembly Boards\n(MABs). Each MAB is a printed circuit board with pin\nsockets for seven modules. Voltage clamps and RO lowpass filters protect the sensitive components inside the\nmodule from damage. The Q-band (W-band) modules\nrequire 28 (23) pins for grounding, biasing active components, and measuring "the detector diode signals. All\nof theoo electrical connections are routed to the outside\nthe cryostat. After the MAB protection circuitry, these\nsigna!s trayel on high density flexiblp. printed circuits\n(FPC), which bring them out of the cryostat through\nStycaEt-epoxy-filled hermetic seals. An additional layer\nof electronic protection circuitry is provided by the array\ninterface boards, which also adapt the FPC signals to\nboard-edge connectors and route to the Bias and Readout systems.\n6.2. Bias System\nAll biasing is accomplished by custom circuit boards.\nThe amplifier bias boards provide voltage and current\nto power the amplifiers in the modules. Each of these\nbias signals is controlled bv a H)-bit digital-to-analog\nconverter (DAC), which allows the biases to be tuned\nfor opt imal performance of each amplifier. Phase switch\nboards provide control currents to the PiN diodes in the\nphase switches. The control current is switched by the\nboard at 4 kHz for one ph... e switch and 50 Hz for the\nother phase switch, generating the modulation described\nin Section 5.2. The data taken during the sv.;itch transition time are discarded in the Readout s:vstem. A housekeeping board monitors the bias signals at R:;: 1 Hz, for\n\n17\n\neach item being monitored. The housekeeping board\nmultiplexes these items, switching only during the phase\nswitch transitions when data will be discarded.\nThe Q-band amplifier bi ... boards are designed to operate at 25\xc2\xb00 so the enclosure is thermally regulated at\nthat temperature. The W-Band amplifier bi... boards use\na different design that is much less temperature sensitive.\nTherefore, the enclosure regulation temperature for the\nW-band is varied between 35\xc2\xb00 and 40\xc2\xb00 depending on\nthe time of ye9.r to reduce the power needed for regulation. For both the Q-band arid W-band obserying seasons, the enclosure temperature remained within the regulation setpoint for R:;: 90% of the time. For the Q-band\nsystem, the excursions primarily affect the drain-current\nbias supplied by the amplifier bias boards, which changes\nthe detector responsivity by \'" 2%/oC. This effect is\ntaken into account with an enclosure-temperature dependent responsivity model (QUIET Collaboration et al .\n2011) .\n\n6.3. Readout System\nThe Readout system first amplifies each modale\'s detector diode output by R:;: 130 in order to match the\nvoltage range of the digitizers. The noise of this warm\npreamplifier circuit does not contribute significantly to\nthe total noise. This is determined in situ at the site by\nselectively turning off the LNAs in the module and seeing that the total noise decreases by roughly two orders\nof magnitude. For the W-band array, the preamplifier\nnoise contributes less than 2% to the total noise in the\nquadrature sum. The amplifier chain also low-pass filters the signal at ~ 160 kHz to prevent aliasing in digitization. Each detector diode output is digitized by a\nseparate 18-bit Analog Devices AD7674 (Analog-Digital\nCOl}verter) ADC with 4V dynamic range at a rate of\n800 kHz. Each ADC Board has a field-programmable\ngate array (FPGA) that accumulates the samples from\nthe 32 ADCs on that Board. The FPGA on one ADC\nBoard, designated the "Master ADO Board", generates\nthe 4 kHz and 50 Hz signals used by the Bias system to\nmodulate the phase switch control currents. This signal\nis also distributed to all ADC Boards, and the FPGA\non each ADC Board uses it to demodulate the detector\ndiode data synchronously with the phase switch modulation.\nFigure 18 su:nmarizes the organization of data performed by the FPGA. The FPGA organizes the 800 kHz\ndetector diode data into continuous 10 rns blocks (i.e.,\n100 Hz time streams), itself organized into continuous\n125 !,S blocks. These 10 ms blocks contain an equal sampling of both 4 kHz clock states. In the "TP" stream, the\n800 kHz data within a 10 ms block are averaged, regardless of the 4 kHz clock state. This stream is sensiti~:e to\nStokes I and is used for calibration and monitoring In the\n"demodulated" stream, data within a 125 J..LS block have\nthe same 4kHz phase state, and are averaged. Averaged\ndata from sequential 125 p,s blocks are differenced, thus\nforming the polarization-sensitive data stream. Offline,\ntwo adjacent 10 ms blocks in the demodulated stream are\ndifferenced to form the "double-demodulated" (50 Hz)\nstream. The W-band ADC firmware was upgraded to\ninclude an additional specially demodulated 100 Hz data\nstream, called the "quadrature stream." Unlike the usual\ndemodulated stream, data within a 125!,s block popu-\n\n18\n\nThe qUIET Collaboration\n\nlate equally both 4 kHz phase states, and are averaged.\nWhen these ayeraged data are differenced, the result has\nthe sa:ne noise as demodulated data but has no sianal.\nThe quadrature stream is used to monitor potential"contamim.tion and to understand the detector noise properties.\n\ntI st.,::.\'"\n\n125 ~ datil block for demod\nt4 ilHzdockmte .. 0")\n\nF1 _............ ..\n\nDetector\nDIode\n\n125 115 dab\'\n\n/\n\nblac~ for qUild~ture\n\nstream {rontains both " ~Hz clock stiItes}\n\n125 11.1 dm blade. for deml;ld\nstf1!am (4 K\'iZ clock state \'" IBO\')\n\nVoltage\n(800kHz\n\nsamplins)\n\n10 ms (50 Hz clock slate" 0")\n\n10 1m (50 Hz clock state . 180\'1\n\n~m.\n\nFIG. 18.- Organization of 800kHz data to form the demodulated and quadrature 100 Hz streams. The blue and fed lines show\ndetector diode data for the two 4 kHz phase states. Levels are\nexaggerated for clarity.\n\nAs noted earlier, the data are masked at the phase\nswitct. transition. r..fasking 14% of the samples around\nthe trE...nsition is found to be adequate to remove contamination in the data stream.\nThe ADC Boards have a small non-linearity in their response. At intervals of 1024 counts, the ADC output has\na jump discontinuity between 1 and 40 counts, affecting\n\'" 14% of the data. This jump is shown schematically in\nFigure 19. When the 800 kHz data stream value falls at\na discontinuity, the jump in the output signal will trickle\ninto tr~e 100 Hz stream. This non-linearity is corrected in\nthe 100 Hz stream. The correction is statistical in nature,\nbased on the width of the 800 kHz noise and its proximity\nto the discontinuity (Bischoff 2010). This nonlinearity,\nif uncorrected, causes a variation of responsivity during\na CES and a svstematic effect similar to the lea..lrnge of\ntemperature to polarization. For the Q-band, the correction reduces the ADC nonlinearity to contribute at most\n3% to the leakage bias systematic error, and at most\n50% to the CES responsitivity systematic error. For\nthe W-band, the residual ADC nonlinearitv adds 40%\nin quadrature to the leakage bias systematic error. The\neffect on the CES responsivity is < 1%, negligible compared to other errors in the gain model. These a..-Ifect r\nat a level below O.al for the W-band.\nThe Readout system ensures that the housekeeping\ndata and 100 Hz data from the detectors are synchro:lized to each other and to the mount motion encoder\nreadout. Synchronization is achieved by distributing the\nsame GPS-derived IRIG-B34 time code to both the receiver and mount electronics. In the Readout system, the\ntome code is decoded by a Symmetricom TTM635VMEOCXO timing board. One-Hz and 10-MHz clock signals,\nlocked to the IRIG-B time code, synchronize the readout of all ADC Boards. The timi::tg board pro-:ides the\nGPS-derived time to the Data Management system so\nthat each datum is assigned a time stamp.\n\n6.4.

When\nthese distributions cross the ADC response discontinuity, the output distributions are split at the discontinuity. When the red and\nblue states ace differenced to create demodulated data, the split\ncaused by the discontinuity is added to the result.\n\nThe Data Management system sends commands to the\nBias system to prepare for observation, acquires the data\nfrom the Readout system, writes them to disk, and creates summary plots of the detector diode signals and\nhousekeeping data for display in real time. The complete data are written to disk and DVDs in the control\nroom at the observation site at a rate of ~ 8 GB day-l\nfor the Q-band array. W -band array data are written\nto blu-ray optical discs at a rate of \'" 35 GB day-\'. A\nsubset of : : : : 10% of the data were transferred by internet every day to North Ameria for more rapid analysis\nand monitoring. The DVDs or bIu-ray discs were mailed\nweekly to North America.\n7. ARTIFICIAL CALIBRATORS\n\nBoth astronomical and artificial calibrators are used\nto characterize the instrument. Astronomical calibrators\nare described in Section 3.4 and Section 8. This section\nfocuses on the artificial calibrators developed for QUIET\nfor use in the laboratory and at the observation site.\n7.1. The Optimizer\nThe polarized response of the receiver in the laboratory is measured with the \'optimizer,\' a reflective plate\nand cryogenic load that rotate around the boresight of\nthe cryostat (Figure 20): The optimizer was used to verify th,at the responsivities derh-ed from unpolarized measurements with cryogenic loads were not substantially\ndifferent from the polarized responsivities, and hence\nthat the projections of instrument sensitivity (which were\nmade from unpolarized measurements) are valid for the\nQ-band array. For the W -band array, the optimizer was\nused to select functioning modules for the final array configuration.\nThe plate is oriented at angle f3 from the plane of the\nfeedhorns and reflects radiation from the cryogenic load\ninto the window of the cryostat with a Stokes Q in tern-\n\nThe QUIET Instrument\n\n19\n\n\\\n\nMetal wires\n~\n\nlUll Tunasten\n\noodtld with 0.1 11m laid\n\n12.7 mm wire pit::h\n\nFIG. 20.- The optimizer consists of a reflecth\'e metal plate and\na cryogenic load, which co-rotate about the cryostat boresight axis.\nThe ylate .angle {J is 45\xc2\xb0.

The grid rotates about\nt!le boresight axis of the cryo&1;at.\n\nperatl:te units given by (Barkats et al. 2005):\n\nvia a small motor, allowing for modulation of the injected\npolarized signal at a constant frequency. The wire grid\nwas used for calibration measurements in the laboratory\nand three times during the observing season: at the end\nof the Q-band observing season and at the beginning and\nend of the W-band season. The grid was not mounted\non the cryostat during sky observations.\nAn example of the data taken with the rotating grid\nis shown in Figure 22. In the idea.! case in which the\nintensity of the reflected radiation is isotropically uniform over the array, the polarized signal D(9) from each\ndetector diode WOUl.d exhibi~ a sinusoidal dependence at\ntwice the frequency of 0, the angle about the cryostat\nboresight axis between the wires and ~ fixed point on\nthe cryostat. The measured polarization signal has an\nadditional dependence on 8 due to rays terminating at\ndifferent temperatures in the non-uniform ground screen.\nThis variation appears in both the polarized data stream\nD and the total power data stream I as a function of\n8, and so this variation can be measured in the 1 data\nstrea..."Il and accounted for in the D data stream. Each\ndetector diode data stream is fitted to the forin\n\n1 471"0\n\nQ=:2\'\n\n.\nT(cosfJ - secfJ)(Tp1\xe2\x80\xa2 te - Ttoad) sm(2<>t),\n\no=J I\';V\'\n\n(14)\n\nwhere p is the bulk resisth-ity of the metal plate, v and\nA correspond to the center frequency and wa.velength of\nthe detector bandpass, t is time, and Tp1a.te and l10ad are\nthe temperatures of the plate and cryogenic load, respectively. Here, 8 is the skin depth, and J1.Q is the permeability of free space. This apparatus rotates at an angular\nspeed <> around the boresight of the cryostat so that the\nresulting polarized signal will rotate between the Stokes\nQ and U at an ang:llar speed of 20. Polarization signals that do not rotate with the s;\'Stem (such as thermal\nemission from objects in the laboratory) will be detected\nat a rate of Ct, and so can be removed.\nThe predicted polarized emission from Eqaation 14 and\nthe measured voltages on the detector diodes are used\nto calculate the polarized responsivities for polarimeters\nwhose beams primarily sample the reflected cryogenic\nload. Various plate materials (aluminum, stainless steel,\nand galvanized steel) and two the.mal loads (liquid nitrogen and liquid argon) are used to obtain multiple e&timates of the polarized responsivity. The ioads are too\nsmall to fill the entire array beam, so only the measurements from the central polarimeter (Q- band) or inner\ntwo rings (W-band) are used.\n\n7.2. The Wire Grid Polarizer\nA \'sparse wire grid\' (Tajima et aI. 2012),,, plane of parallel wires held in a large circular\' frame with the same\ndiameter as the cryostat window, is used to impose and\nmodulate a polarization signal onto the array. For the PI)- .\nlarization parallel to the grid wires, a fraction of the rays\nthat would ordinarily pass through the telescope to the\ncold sky are instead scattered to large angles, mostly terminating on the warm ground shield. The grid is placed\nas close to the cryostat aperture as possible to minimize\ninterference with the telescope optics and to ensure that\nit covers the.field of viev; of each detector (Figure 21).\nWith this geometry, the polarized signal directed parallel to the wires is empirically found to be ~2 K. The\ncircular frame rotates about the cryostat boresight axis\n\nD(O) = Do + (D2\n\n+ \'7[I(O) -\n\n10 ] ) cos[2(9 - -y)], (15)\n\nwhere D(O) and 1(0) are the double-demodulated polarization and total power signals, respectively. Here, 10 is\nthe average of I(O) over all angles 0, and Do is an offset\nterm discussed in Appendix 10.3. The fit extracts \'" the\nangle 0 that maximizes D(~), D 2 , the polarization amplitude (in mV), and \'7, a dimensionless constant relating\nthe total power to polarization responsivity, Since the\nfixed point on the cryostat used to define 0 can be arbitrarily chosen, only the relative JS amongst the detector\ndiodes are relevantj they are just the relath\'e detector\nangles. The values of D2 indicate the spread of polarized responsivities. For the W-band, their relative ratios\nagree with ones derived from Tau A observations at the\nlevel of 20%. The precision ofthis agreement is limited\nby the statistical errors of Tau A observations for the\noff-center detectors.\n8. RECEIVER CHARAaI\'ERIZATION AND CALIBRATION\n\nEach receiver diode (Table 10) is characterized by its\nbandpass, noise level, polarization angle, and total power\nand polarized responsivities.

As with the Q-band array, the bias settings were\nkept fixed during the W-band obsereing season. Because\nthe settings were chosen for signal-to-noise, balance between the legs was not explicitly prioritized (the condequences of this are discussed in the next section) .\n\n8.2. Temperature to Polarization Leakage Remediation\nOne source of leakage from total power into \xc2\xb7 polarization from the module stems from differential power\ntransmission between the two phase switch states within\na given leg (Appendix 10). We found tbat double demodulating (described i:l Section 5.2) typically reduced\nthe root-mean-square of leakage from 0.8% to 0.4% for\nthe W-band modules (Figure 23). The improvement was\nsmaller for the Q-band array, < 0.1%, likelv because it\nwas dominated by other sourCf>S of leakage (Section 3.6\nand Section 5.1) and because the phase switches had been\nbalanced during bias optimization.\n\nDETECTOR YIELD FOR THE Q-BAND AND W-BAND ARRAYS.\n\nBand\nNumber of modules\nP ole.rization modules\nPolarioaation diodes\nWorking polarization diodes (Stokes Q)\n\'Working polariiZiation diodes (Stokes U)\nTotel power modules\nTT diode<; (Stokes Q only)\nWorking TT diodes (Stokes Q only)\n\nQ\n19\n17\n\n68\n31\n31\n\nw\n84\n336\n153\n\nSinai\' Modullition\n-Double Modulation\n\n155\n\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n4\n\n12\n12\n\n8.1.

The amplifiers were then biased one leg at a time so that the first stage amplifier\ndrain current was in the range 0-5 rnA, the second stage\ndrain current was in the range 5-15 rnA, and the third\nstage amplifiers were in the range 15-30 rnA, and that\nthe signal measured by the detector diodes was ~ 5mV.\nThis procedure was repeated, turning on only the phase\nswitch for the other leg, and adjusting again to obtain\na signal difference between the two legs of < O.~m\\\'.\nThis biasing scheme reduced the current through the first\nstage amplifier to 30% of its operational value to keep\nits noise contribution low. The bias values for the phase\nswitches were chosen to equalize the signal measured. on\nthe two separate legs of the module. These bias settings\nwere chosen once at the beginning of the season, and kept\nfixed during the observing season.\nFor the W-band "-"ray, biasing the modules by hand\nwas not feasible due to the large number of modules compared to the Q- band array, and so an automatic method\nI"V\n\n60r----.----~--~----~\n\n90\n\nr\n\nTotal Power Leakage (%) Into Polarization\nFIG. 23.- A histogram of diode leakage values between total\npower and polarization channels during a large angle sky dip for\nthe W-band array before and after double demodula.tion.

The median monopole leakage was\n0.2% for the "\\\\"-band array, which is consistent with leakage measnrements from Jupiter (Section 3.6). The median monopole leakage was 1.0% and 0.2% for the Qdiodes and U-diodes for the Q-band array, respectively,\nwhich are also consistent with measurements from other\ncalibrators. The discrepancy in the monopole leakage\nbetween the two diodes for the Q-band array was ant:c-\n\nThe QUIET Instrument\nipated from the measurements of the septum polarizers\n(Section 5.1).\n\n8.3. Bandpasses\nTypical band passes for the Q-band and W-band arrays\nare shown with the spectrum of the atmosphere in Figure 2. Central frequencies and bandwidths are computed\nfrom discrete frequency steps as\n\n(16)\n\nBandwidth", ---\'-;=;0--\n\n2:,1;,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere Ii is the measured intensity from a detector diode\nfor each frequency, Vi, and .lv is the frequency step of\nthe signal generator (100 MHz).\nFor the Q-band array, bandpasses were measured for\neach diode in the laboratory during the course of array\ntesting and in end-of-season calibration measurements\nat the site. The laboratory measurement was performed\nby injecting a polarized carrier-wave signal from a signal\ngenerator with a standard-gain horn over a 35-50 GHz\nrange. The signal was injected into the receiver array\nthrough the cryostat window without additional imaging optics, with the horn approximately 3 m away from\nthe window. Sweeps were performed at least eight times.\nThe average bandwidth and central frequency of the polarization modules are given in Table 11. The statistical\nerrors on this measurement are obtained by finding the\nstandard. deviation between the eight measurements for\na given module, and then averaging that standard deviation for all ~od ules.\nBandpasses were also measured at the site for the Qband array by reflecting the swept sig!1al from a small\n("-\' lcm 2 ) plate into the primarT mirror. While measurements performed in the laboratory and at the site\nare consiste!1t with each other, the variation in bandpass\nshape between the two days of data taking at the site\nshowed that ~he systematic errors were larger in the experimental setup at the site, so laboratory measurements\nwere used\xc2\xb7where available. Although the amplifier bias\nsettings were different between the laboratory and the\nsite measurements, a review of laboratory measurements\nrevealed that changing the amplifer bias over the range\nof interest had no significant effect on the bandpasses.\nThe systematic error in Table 11 is the average of the\ndifference between the site and lab bandpasses.\nFor the W ~ band array, band passes were measured at\nthe site at the end of the observing season and the central\nfrequency and bandwidth are also given ir. Table 11. A\nstandard-gain horn "laS mounted beside the secondary\nmirror, so it ,could illuminate the cryostat window from\n"-\' 1.5 m away. The signal generator was swept over 72120 GHz, while the phase switches were held constant\n(no switching). In this configuration the signal can be\nsent down each module leg separately. The responses at\neach frequency bin for each module leg were combined to\nemulate the power combinations occurring in the module:\n\n21\n\n(18)\nwhere PA and P B are the measured bandpasses for the\nsignal travelling through module legs A and B, respectivel", q, is the detector angle (for example, a Q diode\nmight have q, = 90\' and a U diode might have q, = 45\'),\nand \'} is the angle of the polarized input from the signal generator. The measured signal is only dependent\non the difference between the two angles. Systematic errors have two main sources: the accuracy with which the\nspike that was used to indicate the beginning of a sweep\ncan be detected, and from reconstructing the bandpass\nfor both module legs biased from data in which only one\nleg is biased. The first was computed b,- noting that the\ntiming was accurate to 1.5 ms, which corresponded to\n0.7GHz during the sweep measurement. The second was\ncomputed by comparing measurements performed with\nboth legs biased and the reconstruction from single-leg\nband passes from the total power stream. Because the total power stream does not have a dependence on detector\nangle q" the two should be identical and the difference\nrepresents the systematic error in the measurement. The\nsystematic error was found to be 0.3 GHz\' for the central\nfrequency and 0.9 GHz for the bandwidth.\n\n8.4. Responsivities\nThe responsivities were characterized for the\ndifferential-temperature module\'3 and the polarization modules separately with different calibration\nsources. Responsivities of the differential-temperature\nmodules are computed from calibration observations of\nJupiter, RCW38, and Venus, one of which was observed\n"-\' once per v.reek for the Q-band receiver, and once a\xc2\xb7\nday for the VltT-band receiver. The ayerage responsivity\nof the differential-temperature modules was 2.2 mV K- 1\nfor the Q-band array and 2.3mVK- 1 for the W-band\narray.\nFor the Q-band array, the absolute polarimeter responsivity for the central horn was determined from Tau A\nmeasurements performed every two days. Relative responsivity values among the polarization modules were\nmeasured from observations of the Moon (performed\nonce per week). Sky dip measurements (eleyation nods\nof "-\' 6\xc2\xb0 for \'normal\' sky dips, and "-\' 40\xc2\xb0 for \'large\' sky\ndips) are also used to obtain the relative total power responsivities of both the differential-temperature and polarized modules before each CES for the Q-band array\n(\'flat fielding\'). These frequent (once every ~ 1.5 hours)\nresponsivit~" measurements provide relative responsh-ity\ntracking for the differential-temperature and polarized\nmodules on short time-scales. The relative responsivities\nwere checked with an end-of-season wire-grid measurement and measurements of Tau A with off-center modules.\nFor the W-band array, the 1-foon is too bright for relative responsiyity calibration, so measurements from the\nwire-grid and Tau A from off-center modules were used.\nThe avera~e responsivity for the polarized modules was\n2.3mVK- for the Q-band array (QUIET Collaboration et al. 2011) and 3.1 mVK-l for the W-band array\n(QUIET Collaboration 2012). These responsivities are\nin terms of antenna temperature and include the gain\n\nThe QUIET Collaboration\n\n22\n\nTABLE 11\nAVERAGE BANDW IDTHS AND CENTRAL FREQUENCIES FOR THE Q-BAND AND W-BAND ARR.AYS.\n\nBand\nQ\nW\n\nBandwidth (GHz)\nCentral Frequency (GHz)\nValue Stat. error System. error Value Stat. error System. error\n0.5\n0.6\n43.1\n0.4\n0.4\n7.6\n1.1\n: 94.5\n0.8\n10.7\n\nfactor of 130 from the preamplifier boards (Section 6.3).\nThe responsivity depends on the amplifier bias set~\ntings. The bias ,-alues for the Q-band array were found\nto be dependent on the bias board temperature (typical\nvalues are 2% of the average responsivity per \xc2\xb0C), which\nwas the motivation for thermally regulating the electronics enclosure within 1 \xc2\xb00 of 25 \xc2\xb0e. The final responsivity\nmodel included. a linear term for this temperature depende:lce, and it was found to be a negligible systematic for scientific analysis (QUIET Collaboration et a:.\n2011). The bias circuit was upgraded in, the W-band array, rendering the temperature depender..ce of the boards\n\nnegligible.\nOne potential concern when using amplifiers is signal co!Ilpression: an input-dependent responsh-ity which\nis greatl:; reduced at high input powers. Compression is typically manifested as different responsivity values for different load temperatures, and has important\nconsequences when using responsivities from calibration\nsources which are all usually mt:ch warmer than the Cl\\IB\nitself (for example, the Moon is \'" 223 K, Ulich et al.\n(1973)) and from extrapolating total power responsivities to polarization responsivities (for example, from sky .\ndip measurements). For the Q-band array, responsivity\nmeasurements in the laboratory and at the site with different calibration sources were all consistent with each\nother, confirming that the modules were not operating\nin \'a compressed regime. Laboratory responsivity studies\nof the W-band modules using liquid nitrogen as a cold\nload showed some evidence for compression. In the field,\nthe W-band modules exhibited compression during observations of the Moon. The emission from the\n10\nMoon varies across its face (Ulich et al. 1973); polarized\nresponsivities varied between the brightest and darkest\nportions of its faee by 20% (worst case 50%).\nCompression affects the polarized signal and the total\npower signal differentlv (Appendix 10.1). Since the skv\ndips measure total power responsivity only, this complicates the use of sky dips to track relative polarized responsivity for the W-band array. As a result, dally Tau\nA measurements of a single module were used to measure\nfast yariations. Relative responsivities between the central module and the other modules are obtained from\nadditional Tau A measurements and an end-of-season\npolarization grid measurement and these were used to\nextrapolate absolute responsivities to all modules.\nAdditional laboratory studies performed after deployment explain vrhy the W-band modules were operated\nin a compressed regime: passive components in the Wband modules had as much as twice the expected loss.\nTo compensate for this loss, the amplifiers were biased\nhigher than optimal. As a result, the bias power was\nlarge enough that it contributed a significant fraction of\nthe power required to compress the amplifiers. !\\.Iodules\nwith new passive components having lower loss have been\nproduced. These modules exhibit little compression and\nr.J\n\nhave noise temperatures closer to the\nW-band amplifier noise(Reeves 2012).\n\nfV\n\n50 K intrinsic\n\n8.5. Detector Angles\nAbsolute polarized detector angles were measured for\nthe central module of each array through observations of\nTau A, whose position angle is known to 0.20 precision\nfrom IRAl\\! measurements (Aumont et al. 2010). For the\nQ-band array, the absolute angle shifted by as much as\n20 due to jumps in the polnting from a 100se encoder during the first half of the Q-band season . . The systematic\nuncertainties related to the encoder jumps are discussed\nin (QUIET Collaboration et al. 2011). The Q-band angle calibration relied on weekl!\' 1.Ioon observations and\nan end-of-season sparse wire grid measurement to find\nthe relative angles of the diodes. The relative angles between one of the diodes of the central module and every\nother diode from all - 35 Moon measurements deviated\n1(\'1)8 than 0.20 from nominal , indicating that the relative angles remained nearly constant during the season.\nRelative detector angles are not afected by the encoder\njumps.\nThe W-band array had a smaller, more efficient Tau A\nscan trajectory and was able to make measurements with\nall modules over the course of the season to obtain absolute angle calibration. The variance of detector angles\nfor the central module from repeated measurements of\nTau A is 0.30 \xe2\x80\xa2 The relative angles among the diodes were\nconfirmed with end-of-season wire-grid measurements for\nboth arrays to within 0.9\nRelative angles for all diodes in the W -band array are\nshown in Figure 24. Systematic errors in the absolute\nangle are the largest source of systematic errors for the\nW -band array, which would limit the measurement of r\nto 0.01 at f - 100 (QUIET Collaboration 2012).\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n8.6. Pointing\nThe telescope pointing model is derived by fitting a\nphysical model of the three-axis mount and telescope\nto astronomical observations (Nress 2012). The orientations of individual feed horns are determined by observations of the Moon and Jupiter. Then, holding the\nfocal plane layout fixed, the parameters of the dyn amical mount model are determined from observations of\nJupiter, Venus, RCW38 (W-band only), and the Galactic planeas . Optical observations are taken regularly with\na co-aligned star camera and used to monitor the time\nevolution of the pointing model. Except for the mechanical problem with the deck-angle encoder during the first\ntwo months of Q-band observations (QUIET Collaboration et al. 2011), no significant trends are found.\nThe residual scatter after all pointing corrections is\n3.5\' rfiS in the Q-band observations (QUIET Collabora35 For preliminary Galactic maps from QUIET, see Wehus\n(2012).\n\nThe QUIET Instrument\n\n23\n\n....\n\nTelescope scanning frequencies\n\n...\n~\n\n135\n\n10\' "\n\n\'- !\n\nHj\'\n\n0\n\n45\n\no\n\n0\n\n~ 10\'\n\n! -45\n\n10\'\n\n:Eu\n\nc\n\n,\n\n. ....

A\ntypical noise power spectrum for a W-band module is\ngiven in Figure 25, which also shows the effects on the\nnoise of demodulati!1g and double demodulating the time\nstreams.

Instrument Sensitivity\nThe sensitivity for the polarization response, Spol\n(ILKs\' /2), is calculated as the ratio of the white noise ieyel\nto the respor.sivity. For the Q-band array, after data selection (QUIET Collaboration et al. 2011) , the sensitivity\nis 69 J.LKS1/2 corresponding to an average module sensitiv- .\nity of 275 ILKs!/2. For the W-band array, the array sensitiyity is 87 ILKsl/2 (QUIET Collaboration 2012), COITesponding to an average module sensitivity of 756 ILKs1/\'.\nBoth values are given in thennodynamic units, so that\nthe power detected b~\' the receiver has been corrected\nfrom a Rayleigh-Jeans approximation to correspond to\nfiuctu&tions in the blackbody temperature of the C?lB.\nFunctior.ally this is performed by dividing by C RJ , which\nis 0.95 (0.79) for the Q-band (W-band) central frequen-\n\nQUIET employs the largest HEMT-based receiver arrays to date. The 17-element Q-band array has a polarization sensitivity of 69 J.LKS1 / 2, currently the most sensitive instrument in this band. The 84-element W-band\narray has a 87 ILKs l / \' sensitivity.

APPENDIX\n\n10.1. Compression\nThis section expla:ns some subtleties regarding nonlin-\n\nearities, and how they affect the polarization and total\npower measurements differently. This complicates the\nuse of periodic telescope sky dips to track the total power\nresponsivity, which is assumed to also track the polarization responsitivity. During C:MB operations, the receiver\n\nload temperature varies by ~ 2K due to changes in the\nsky loading. Nonlinearities also affect the use of large\nskv dip and I\\Ioon signals to calibrate the total power respocsivi~j\xc2\xb7. For HEUT LNAs, compression (in which the\namplifier gain depends on the input signal leyel) is the\nnonlinearity that is typically encountered in the QUIET\noperating regime.\nThe effect of compression on polarization responsivity\nis analyzed here. Consider a horn looking at an unpolarized background at temperature To, where To = To:!\': =\nTOy, with axes x and y defined by the septum polarizer.\nGiven below are the Q1 diode measurements for the 0\xc2\xb0\n\nand 1800 leg B states, and the demod output (which is\nthe polarization measurement):\n\n8 0 (0") =go . G(To. + Toy) +\n0\n\n8 0 (180 )=go\' G (Tox+ TOy)\n8 0 (demod) =\n\n~(80(O") -\n\n~(Tox -\n\nTOY\xc2\xbb) ,\n\n- ~(Tox - TOY\xc2\xbb) \'\n\n8 0(180\xc2\xb0\xc2\xbb\n\n1\n\n= \'2 \' 90 . (To. - Toy) = 0 ,\n\n(A I )\n\nwhere go is the, gain at temperature To\xc2\xb7\nConsider now the horn looking at a source on top\n\nof this background. Without loss of generality, let the\nsource be polarized in the x direction at temperature\nT1 such that Tb: = T<n: + TSxl T 1y = T Oll I Ta1Jg\n~ , (Tax + Tsz + TOy). Then:\n\n8 , (0\xc2\xb0)= 9,.

Tsx\n\n-TOy\xc2\xbb)\n\n~(Tox +Tsx -\n\nTOY\xc2\xbb)\n(A2)\n\nNote that the gain constant g, is relevant for the temperature T a1Jg , for the following reason. Since the incident\n\nE-fields at t he horn input are linearly polarized, the sept um polarizer splits the power equally between legs A\n\n26\n\nThe QUIET Collaboration\nrespectively. It can be shown that:\n\nand B. Thus the legs see a constant input power given\nby Tav9\' regardless of the instrumental position angle.\nWithin the module, the LNAs are placed upstream of\nany phase-sensitive circuitry. .In this model, compression depends primarily on the input power at the first\nLNA. Therefore, t he first LNA sees power l\'epresented\nby T avg , so a gaih g1 is associated to that input terr..perature. Thus, Equation A2 shows that the polarization\nmeasurement is compressed by (90 - 91)/91. It:s estimated that (90 - 91) /91 changes by roughly 0.1 % per\nKelvin for the W-band modules.\nNow consider the effect of compression on the to-\n\nSI(av9) - So(av9) =91(Ti - To)e\n0= (1 _ 90-91 To )\n91 TI-To\n\nwhere c is the ratio between the observed signal difference\nand the expected difference without compression.\nComparing Equation A5 with A2, the total power sensitivity compression is magnified by To/(TI -To). Assuming as an example, TI - To = 2K (typical for a skydip),\na system temperature of To = 120K, and a typical gain\ncompression of (90 - 911/91 = 0.002 over that range, the\nresulting ratio is c = 93%, or 7% signal loss. Therefore, in\nthe data analysis, the absolute responsiYities are derived.\nfrom polar:\'zed source measurements to avoid systematic\nbiases of this type for the W-band diodes.\n\ntal pO\';ver responsivity. . For an unpolarized background\n\nsource at temperature To , the 01 diode voltages fc: the\nleg B 0\xc2\xb0 and 180\xc2\xb0 states are as given in Equation AI,\nand the average (which gives the total power) is:\n\nSo (av9) =\n\n~ (SoW) + 80 (180\xc2\xb0))\n1\n\n= -:l . 90 . (Tax\n\n+ Toy) =\n\n10.2. Double demodulation\n\n90 . To\n\nThis section discusses some imperfections in the module and their mitigation using double demodul ation. Table 8 shows the detector diode outputs of an ideal module\nfor the two leg B states, with the leg A state held fixed.\nThe idealization (see Figure 15(a)) assumes equal transmission between the two leg B states, and between the\ntwo leg A stat.., and an ideal septum poiarizer (see Section 10.3). In practice, the transmissions are unequal,\nthus requiring extra parameters to describe the module.\nWithout loss of generality, let the transmission through\nthe O\n\'(t) state of legs A and B be equal to unity, and\ndefine fJA and fJB to be the transmissions through these\nlegs for the 18O\' (.J.) state. Using 9A and 9B as the effective voltage gains of the two legs (see Figure 27) , the\ndetector diode voltages are given by:\n\n(A3)\n\nSimilarly, an \'..lnpolarized background source at temperatu:e Tl results fn:\n\n(M)\nHere, :11 and 90 are the gains for temperatures T1 and To\n\n1\n2\n,\n-:l(9A + 9B )1\n1\n\'2\n-:l(9A\n\n1 9A\n+ -:l ( \' -\n\n9B 2) V\n\n\xc2\xb19A9BQ\n\nVu, (Vu,) =\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n2\n2\n2\n+ "2(9A - 9B PB )V\n\n\'f9A9B,BBQ\n\n1(g\'2\n"2 A fJA + 9B \') 1\n\n1( , 2\n,\n+ "2 9A fJA - 9B )V\n\n\'f 9A9B fJA O\n\n+\n\n1 (2\n2)\n-:l 9A +9B 1\n\n=4\n\nfJB )1\n\n~(9A\'fJA2 + 9B\'fJB 2)1\n\nvQ,(VQ,)\n\n1\n\n(A5)\n\n+ "2(9A -9B)V\n\n1\n2\n-:l(9A\n\n+ 9B\n\n+ 9B\n\n1\n2\n2\n-:l(9A fJA\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2,\n\n~(9A2fJA\' 1\n\n2\n\nPB )1\n\n+ 9B 2 )1\n\n~(9A\'fJA2 + 9B\'fJB\')1\nwhere the upper (lower) signs correspond to the signal of the diodes QI and UI (0, and U,).

Polarimeter Assembly Offset and I --> Q/U\nLeakage\nAs shown in Section 10.21 it can be assumed that the\nmodule does not generate any instrumental polarization\non its own since the double demodulation procedure !lulls\nout this effect. Howeyer, the interaction between the\nmodule and septum polarizer can cause irreducible instrumental polarization and offsets; this section derives\nthese couplings. Since the module does not generate instrumental polarization on its own, the module measures:\n(AS)\nand\n(A9)\nwherE Lm and Rm are the signals transmitted into the\nmodule inputs. Without loss of ger.eralitr, all the constant factors are absorbed into the fej;jponsivity and set\n-to unity. The signals transmitted into the module inputs\nneed aot be the same as the Land R components at\nthe septum polarizer input; this difference is a cause of\ninstrUlllental polarization.\nThe effect of the septum polarizer is described by a 4004\n\nTABLE 14\nEXPRESSIONS FOR THE DEMODUL\\TED OUTPUT\n\ne~,\'1\n\nC\n\n~~T24\n\n"c\n\nr3\n\n- 172T34\n\n1\n\n-272T34\nr4\n\ne"\n(\n\nr41\n\nI --> Q/U leakage distribution is reduced from roughly\nO.S% ill the demodulated stream, to 0.4% in the doubledemodulated stream.

For an ideal septum polarizer, T = 1 and T = C = O. Symmetry across the septum\nimplies T21 = T3b T24 = \'34 , T2 = T3, and T4l = "0, although manufacturing errors can cause these conditions\nto be violated. As described in Sections 5.1 and S, there\nare small departures from ideal operation. In this section\nthese departures are computed up to second order. Note\nthat the scattering matrix is frequency-dependent. The\nanalysis given here is strictly for a single frequency. In\npractice, the result shouid be averaged with the effective\nbandpass. The median value of the Q(W)-band, bandaveraged return loss (= -20 log IrlJ for the septum polarizers is 19(30) dB, while the median value of t he Q(W)band, band-averaged isolation (= -20 log lei) is 22(2S)\ndB. Another quantity of interest is median value of the\nband averaged (linear) 8J<ial ratio of the septum polarizers. This is measured to be 1.12(1.07) for Q(W)-band\nand implies a cross polar discrimination of 24.9(29.4) dB.\nA perturbative expansion is used to derive Lm and Rm.\nwhich are tbe fields transmitted into tbe module inputs\ndue to a sky source consisting of fields E. and E y \xe2\x80\xa2 Here\na noiseless module is assumed..

The presence of Tij in these terms parameterizes\nthe imperfections in the septum polarizer transmissions.\nThese terms reduce the gain to Q and U, and in general\ncause mixing between Q and U. In practice, the gain is\nabsorbed into the calibration of the total system responsivity,36 and the Q/U leakage is absorbed into the detector angle as defined in Equations 9 and 10. Therefore,\nthese ~wo terms do not cause instrumental polarization,\nand these imperfections can be neglected in the following\ndiscussion. By the same argument, the terms TgTR and\nT2Ti, in Equation A16 can be ignored since their only\neffect is to change the gain and detector angle.\nThe third and fourth terms represents J -+ Q/ U and\nV -+ Q/U leakage respectively. Since V \xc2\xab I for reasonable sources and the coefficients have the same order,\nthese circular polarization leakages are neglected. Combining these simplifications, the right-hand-side of Equation Al6 becomes:\n\nL:"R=\n\n=~\n\n7\'~47\'3\')U,\n\n-\n\nQm = R(Q)\n\n1\n+ 2!R(7\';17\'3\' -\n\n7\'247\'34)J + !R(crL\n\n+C\n"TRY,\n\n(A19)\nwhere the first term is the expected response, the second\nterm is I -> Q leakage due to differential loss, and the\nthird term is leakage caused by reflections at the module inputs coupling with the septum polarizer crosstalk.\nSimilarly, using Equation A9 and ignoring the Q -> U\nleakage:\n\nUm =\n\n~(U) - i~(7\'2\'7\'3\'\n\n- 7\'247\'3.)J -\n\n~(C;\'L + c\xc2\xb7 Tn)J\xc2\xb7\n\n(A20)\nIn summary, the two equations above describe the measurements of a sky signal in the absence of noise from\nthe module.\n.\nNow consider the case of noise emitted from the module\ninputs, reflecting from the septum polarizer and returning into the module ..Module noise stems primarily from\nthe HEMT-based first stage LNAs. Since the sky signal\nand module noise are relatively incoherent, they decouple and the sky signal can be neglected in the follov:ing. Let the module noise fields be given by the column\nvector (0, L" Rr, 0).
