b'Compact Radiometers Expand Climate Knowledge\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nN\n\nASA not only peers up to gather information\nabout space; it also peers down to gather\ninformation about Earth. As part of the\nScience Mission Directorate, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Earth Science\nProgram aims to improve predictions about climate,\nweather, and natural hazards by understanding Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nresponse to natural and human-induced changes. One\nway scientists are tracking these changes is by monitoring the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s soil moisture and ocean salinity.\nAs part of the water cycle, soil moisture and ocean\nsalinity are interconnected with Earth\xe2\x80\x99s energy and\nbiogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, and others).\nTogether, these natural cycles play a role in moderating\nthe overall environment. For example, ice can melt into\nthe ocean to dilute ocean salinity, which affects ocean\ncirculation, which affects an area\xe2\x80\x99s climate.\nIn 2015, NASA plans to embark on a mission called\nSoil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) to provide\nglobal measurements of soil moisture and its freeze and\nthaw states. Measurements from the SMAP spacecraft will\nlead to a better understanding of the processes that link\nthe water, energy, and carbon cycles, and will significantly\ninform Earth system science, water resource assessment,\nand natural hazards mitigation.\nThe best way to measure surface conditions such as\nsoil moisture and ocean salinity is through microwave\nremote sensing at long wavelengths, such as at L-band.\nHowever, receiving long wavelengths from Earth requires\nlarge antennas in space. To prepare for microwave remote\nsensing at long wavelengths, NASA has supported the\ndevelopment of smaller, lighter, more compact devices to\nuncover fluctuations in soil moisture and ocean salinity.\n\nPartnership\nAs a result of Small Business Innovation Research\n(SBIR) funding from Goddard Space Flight Center in\n2000, ProSensing Inc., of Amherst, Massachusetts, devel102\t Environmental Resources \t\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Soil Moisture Active and Passive mission, planned for 2015, will gather global measurements of soil moisture and its freeze\nand thaw states to inform the scientific community\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of climate, the carbon cycle, and water resources.\n\noped a compact, ultrastable radiometer for sea surface\nsalinity and soil moisture mapping. Taking advantage\nof the rapid advances in telecommunications at the\ntime, ProSensing incorporated small, low-cost, highperformance elements into just a few circuit boards. By\nusing two or more radiometers (called arraying) and\ncombining the signals they receive, the radiometers act as\nsmall pieces of one large system.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was important to make them small enough to hold\nin the palm of your hand. Previous radiometers were\nabout 10 times the size. If we built radiometers the old\nway, it would take a lot more time, money, and effort.\nBy using cell phone technology, it cost 50-percent less\n\nand gave us a competitive advantage,\xe2\x80\x9d says James Mead,\npresident of ProSensing.\nBy 2005, ProSensing had delivered 35 units to\nGoddard for use in a research instrument called 2D-STAR\n(Two Dimensional Steered Thin Array Radiometer).\nFlown on an aircraft, 2D-STAR was developed to demonstrate interferometric technology (arraying radiometers\nto act as one large radiometer) for remote sensing of soil\nmoisture.\nDavid M. Le Vine, a scientist at Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, says, \xe2\x80\x9c2D-STAR achieves the results of a large\nantenna without putting a massive structure in space. We\nwere able to show the technology could work from airplanes, with the idea of going from airplanes to space.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSpinoff 2010\n\nProduct Outcome\nDuring its work with Goddard, ProSensing received\na request from the University of Melbourne, Australia,\nto build six ultrastable radiometer modules for airborne remote sensing at a new facility being developed\nthrough the support of the Australian Research Council,\nUniversity of Melbourne, University of Newcastle, James\nCook University, and Airborne Research Australia at\nFlinders University. By 2006, ProSensing had built and\ndelivered a polarimetric L-band microwave radiometer\n(PLMR) using the radiometer modules.\nAccording to the University of Melbourne, PLMR\nenables mapping in unprecedented detail of soil moisture,\nland surface salinity and temperature, and ocean surface\nsalinity and temperature. The University appreciates the\ninstrument\xe2\x80\x99s small size, light weight, and affordability.\nBased on the advances made possible by working with\nNASA, ProSensing offers two lightweight radiometers for\nmapping soil moisture, ocean salinity, and wind speed:\nthe PLMR and the Scanning Low Frequency Microwave\nRadiometer. ProSensing\xe2\x80\x99s customers include government\nresearch agencies, university research groups, and large\ncorporations in North America, Europe, and Asia.\nThe way a microwave radiometer works is by measuring natural radiation. In the case of the ocean, the amount\nof signal that is radiated changes with salinity. The\nparameter used to describe this is called the emissivity of\nthe surface. In the case of soil, the emissivity changes with\nmoisture. Additionally, the emissivity depends on how\nrough a surface is, and this is why a radiometer can also\nmeasure wind speed over the ocean. The faster the wind\nblows, the rougher the surface gets, resulting in more\nsignals being transmitted to the radiometer.\nIn 2008, the NASA-derived technology influenced the\ndesign and development of a hurricane imaging radiometer (HIRAD) to measure ocean wind speed in hurricanes.\nThe instrument, under development at Marshall Space\nSpinoff 2010\t\n\nProSensing Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s ultrastable compact radiometers are\nemployed around the world to map soil moisture, ocean\nsalinity, and wind speed.\n\nFlight Center, uses the same technique as the ultrastable\nradiometer, but operates at a different wavelength.\nHIRAD is a compact, lightweight, low-power instrument that produces imagery from an aircraft or spacecraft.\nSpecifically, Marshall is developing HIRAD to measure\nocean surface wind speed from hurricane reconnaissance\naircraft with fine spatial resolution over a wide angular\nswath. ProSensing delivered 12 single-board, four channel radiometer receivers to Marshall, which are now being\nintegrated into HIRAD.\nIn 2009, ProSensing received a contract from one of\nthe largest research centers in Germany, the Institute of\nChemistry and Dynamics of the Geosphere, to build a\ncopy of the PLMR. Requiring six ultrastable radiometer\nmodules, the Institute uses PLMR for research measurements of soil moisture and salinity.\nMost recently, the University of Massachusetts\nrequested two radiometer modules from ProSensing to\n\nTwelve receiver modules like this one will be combined in a\nhurricane imaging radiometer to measure wind speeds\nin hurricanes.\n\ntest their applicability for noninvasive readings of cerebrospinal fluid temperature (temperature of the fluid that\ncirculates around and through the brain and spinal cord).\nUsually, a spinal tap is used for this procedure to diagnose\ncertain neurologic disorders, particularly infections like\nmeningitis. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can take temperature remotely with a\nradiometer and see that it is elevated, then this could have\nwide application in emergency rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mead.\nMead says many projects have grown out of the NASA\nSBIR program over the years. \xe2\x80\x9cNASA had a long-term\ninterest in developing the technology and was eager to\ntake what we built and put it to use. That gave us something to design to. Now we have some fairly mature\nprojects, and some that are just getting kicked off.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x9d\x96\nEnvironmental Resources \t 103\n\n'
