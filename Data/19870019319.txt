The topics addressed\n2\n\n-\n\nare plug characterization efforts in a small pore size regime of sintered metal plugs, characterization in the non-linear regime, temperature profiles in a heat supply unit for a fountain effect\npump and modeling efforts.\n\n1\n\n2.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe general task of fluid management in space has included the special challenge of\n\nmoving and confining liquid Helium. This cryo-liquid has a very low surface tension. Therefore, some conventional confinement schemes for high surface tension liquids have not been\nemployed on a large scale. Fortunately the quantum liquid He II, i.e. Helium-4 in its\nsuperfluid phase below 2.17 K, permits the utilization of thermomechanical forces (TM\nforces). Related developments of equipment for space application have been very encouraging. A first application area has been vapor-liquid phase separation (VLPS) using porous\nplugs. The TM force is directed into the tank interior to establish liquid confinement while\npermitting stable vapor venting. The "IRAS" observatory, a free flyer for far infrared nightsky observations, has been the initial successful system in this area.\n\n..,\n\nAnother application area is the fountain effect pump (FEP or thermomechanical pump).\nThe TM force is directed in the desired pumping direction. In contrast to VLPS, the liquid\n\nL\n\nmass flow rate desired is not in a simple co-current setup with respect to heat flow. The\nswitch from VLPS to FEP operation has brought about an interest in smaller pore sizes than\nin VLPS work. The reason for the switch has been a low maximum fountain pressure\n\ndifference in a single-stage device. As the pore size is decreased, the critical velocity is\nincreased. Along with it the static pressure difference APT of the He I1 thermomechanics is\nraised. The permeability range is on the order of lo-" cm2, or even\n\ncm2. Smaller pore\n\nsizes are not of great interest at present because of a significant lambda point depression and a\nlarge space required for a specified liquid flow rate. The Darcy permeability (K) is employed\nas a unique throughput measure. The related characteristic length L, = K% has been found to\nbe a useful reference length in phenomenological equations.\n\n2\n\nAn additional application area is the general utilization of the TM force in heat\npumping/refrigeration systems. The latter in principle have the potential of contributing to a\nbetter energetics of an entire space flight duration as far as the He I1 bath functioning is concerned. In the general application area, several crucial components have been recognized as\nimportant devices. Examples are the pump core (porous plug), and related plugs for\nmechano-calorics, the heat exchanger system (thermal energy transfer system), the fluid\nacquisition device, possible venting components, e.g. VLPS, and connecting plumbing along\n- . - 1 L\n\n-^e^&_- - - 2 - - A\n\nWlLll bitlCLY U G V l b G 3\n\n..a\n\n.-,.-\n\n: , ,\n, e\n\n."\n\n4 1 1 1 U UIllCIIl3.\n1 U 1 3\n\nIn the preceding period of Summer 1986, the FEP energetic effectiveness ("efficiency")\nhas been a topic of interest using the transfer pump of our lab as example (Appendix A). The\nperformance of the FEP in terms of the mass throughput versus the externally applied temperature difference AT has been studied. This work has resulted in "pump constants"\nevaluated by Dr. Yuan for various plugs. Prior to this work the mass transfer (volumetric\ntransfer) effectiveness has been a subject of interest as the losses ought to be small for\nefficient fluid management. It turned out that this transfer "efficiency" has been quite close to\n98% in the best cases. Thus little concern appeared to relate to this quantity. From the above\nloose use of "efficiency" ("effectiveness") terms, it is clear that a careful distinction of various\ndefinitions is necessary in order to avoid confusing interpretation. The energetics may not be\nas impressive as for a mechanical pump. The latter however is subject to cavitation danger in\nunprotected simple space operation. Therefore special measures have been tried to make the\nmechanical system "space flight ready".\nFor the FEP energetics the temperature difference AT plays a significant role since the\nsecond law of thermodynamics is not invalidated in the superfluid area. There are some peculiar constraints which modify the usual heat exchange conditions. Thus, the present work has\ncontinued thermal investigations of 1986 with the goal of understanding the optimum utiliza-\n\ntion of TM force use better. In any case it is noted that there are always two extreme cases\nwhich may be inspected readily: one case is the very small temperature difference AT a T.\nIt results in a very small FEP energetic effectiveness. The other case is the large temperature\ndifference, i.e. a cold side significantly below the lambda temperature (TA= 2.17 K). In that\ncase the steep entropy-T function leads to the neglect of low-T terms and a simple result may\nbe obtained. The energetic effectiveness, for instance is high at large AT and VLPS use for\nheat injection is characterized by very small volumetric losses. VLPS in space is easily\naccomplished as the vacuum uf the environment is reaciiiy avaiiabie wiiiiuui vacuum pump\nrequirements of terrestrial magnet cooling systems.\nThe present report considers the progress made since activation of the present Grant\nNAG 2-464 in July 1987. The topics are treated as listed in the Table of Contents. Additional information is contained in Appendix sections. There have been additional experiments\naiming at a more complete picture of porous media behavior. The data obtained are outlined\nas available at this time of report writing (September 1987).\n\n4\n\n3.\n\nPLUG CHARACTERIZATION LINEAR REGIME ZNMF\n\nZNMF stands for Zero Net Mass Flow. This mode has been selected for the additional studies because of a "pump constant"/"plug constant" controversy. In some experiments\nwith porous media, authors have seen similar "mutual friction" results for both, ZNMF modes\nand pump modes of FEP operation. The present work however, starting with the VLPS work\nand porous plug studies of S . W. K. Yuan and William A. Hepler, has revealed significant\ndifferences between FEP unit and VLPS system behavior. A clarification concerning ZNMF\nought to cover a comparable range of porous plugs from the point of view of VLPS data. It\nturns out that the ZNMF range has been rather restricted at high AT. Therefore, several\nexperimental runs have been conducted in the ZNMF mode. First, the linear range has been\nconsidered to obtain permeability results K(T)from the low-T analog of Darcy\'s law. Second,\nthe non-linear range has been covered in order to obtain the rate constants of the turbulent\nregime.\nThe low-T permeability is accessible in a simple manner using the analog of Darcy\'s\nlaw for the He I1 thermomechanics. The usual pressure difference AP is replaced by the thermomechanical pressure difference APT The latter is produced by an externally applied temperature difference AT. The temperature drives heat through the porous plug. Thus, instead\nof a mass flow of Darcy convection, the heat flow is of concern. The two-fluid model is used\nfor quantification. According to this model, the heat flow is associated with flow of the normal fluid. The impeding property is the shear viscosity of the normal fluid. Therefore all\nquantities are quite similar to those of Darcy\'s law. The (superficial) normal fluid flow speed\n\n,\nV\n\nI I\n\nis proportional to the Darcy permeability (K), proportional to the pressure gradient vPT ,\n\nand inversely proportional to the shear viscosity qn. Thus\n\n5\n\nFigure 3.1 presents first an overview of carbon thermometer response for a particular\nplug of stainless steel with a permeability on the order of lo-\'\' cm2.\n\nThere are three\n\ndifferent thermograms with T (in arbitrary units) as a function of time (t). The setup is\nsketched as inset in Figure 3.2.\n\nThe three thermograms (Fig. 3.1) show a low power input (Q), an intermediate input\nand a high power input. For the linear regime discussion the low input is of interest. For\ndetails of similar thermograms the Ph.D. thesis of Dr. C. Chuang (UCLA 1981) and related\npublications may be consulted. Only small Q-values permit the evaluation of the permeability.\nThe linear regime is accessible readily when there is laminar flow of the ZNMF mode.\nFigure 3.2 indicates this range. Most of the results though are in the non-linear range. The\npermeability is obtained readily from the linear domain response. From the thermograms the\nfinal result in AT has been deduced for infinitely long times. The AT is quite small for the\npresent plug during laminar flow. Therefore a simplified calibration procedure is useful permitting fast data reduction: the resistance R of the thermometer as a function of the vapor\npressure P, is a monotonically decreasing function R(P,).\n\nTo first order, this function is\n\nlinear in log-log coordinates. The "slope" of the function is determined, and AT is deduced\nreadily for small A T e T. For this constraint the difference AT is about AR(dT/dR). Details\nof this calibration procedure for small temperature differences are given in Appendix D.\nThe permeability obtained is displayed in Figure 3.3 as a function of the bath temperature.\n\n6\n\nT(K)\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nTEMPERATURE ( T ) O F IIEATED CHAMRER\nT I M E ( t ) FOR STEP PONER I N P U T\n\nVS.\n\n2.0\n\nI. 9\n\n1.8\n\nFigure 31.

The constant, designated as K&,,\nturned out to be a monotonically increasing function of the permeability. In other words, a\nsize effect on the heat flux density qo (= superficial value = Q divided by the total plug area)\nis quite distinct. It reduces the flow rates significantly, compared to bulk liquid values. The\nquestion has been whether the ZNMF mode would show a similar size effect of the pores, and\ngrains in the plug respectively.\nA first survey of the non-linear regime (Appendix B) has shown that similar\nphenomena apparently prevail in ZNMF systems. However, the small number of data sets is\na disturbing factor preventing f b n conclusions. Further, slits appear to indicate that the\nporosity is an important additional parameter of influence. Therefore, the present data sets\nprovide additional evidence. Figure 4.1 is a set of data for the plug K10S02-6.6x0.75. The\nplug designation and some definitions of factors in the literature are given in Appendix C.\nFigure 4.2 presents the data trends of ZNMF rate constants in the non-linear regime\nbased on the usual modified Gorter-Mellink transport function introduced already by S. W.\n\nK. Yuan (op. cit.). The rate constant is designated as K k F . The ZNMF data indicate\nindeed a data trend as in VLPS (Figure 4.3). The highest ZNMF rate constant is for a fibrous\nmedium reported previously by the Nijmegen group [l] (compare Appendix B). The second\npoint is from the M.S. thesis of J. M. Lee (UCLA 1983). The lowest rate constant is the preliminary value obtained in the present runs. Though further work is needed, and in progress, it\nis clear that the rate constants show very similar features in both VLPS and ZNMF modes. In\ncontrast the "pump constants" of FEP operation exhibit very different behavior: they are very\nweakly dependent on K for the small permeabilities needed for FEP units. For larger pore\nsizes, i.e. higher permeabilities, the pump constants appear to tend toward lower values.

The FEP unit built\n\nhas been described by William Chen (op. cit. below). Figure 5.1 is a schematic diagram of\nthe experimental system. The FEP has been aluminum oxide compacted for low permeability.\nBelow this pump core is the heater unit. A U-tube section is located downstream of the\nheater established as Cu powder plug. The vertical duct after the U-section permits the transition to the FEP flow outlet outside the vacuum can. The liquid is emitted as a jet rising\ntoward the maximum location of the fountain.\nThe temperature profiles are shown in Figure 5.2 for two bath temperatures. The\nupper section of the figure is a schematic diagram of the heater system (turned 90 degrees).\nIn principle, the T-profiles may have a domain showing an increase in T along the flow path.\nHowever this is seen for low bath temperatures, not at high bath temperatures. The Tincrease is in qualitative agreement with data reported by Hofmann et al. (1986) [2] for He 1\n1\nnear a pressure of 1 atm. A plausible reason for this T-increase is the monotonic rise of T,\nfor uniform wall heating, using the calorimetric mean temperature. It is noted in addition that\nthe 1 atm pump had a heater wire system wound around the outer tube downstream of the\nPump Plug.\nIn Figure 5.2 all runs at 1.4 K show a drop in temperature toward the downstream end.\nThis indicates heat leakage toward the downstream liquid. For wide tubes the van Sciver\nmodel involves a similar behavior for a certain type of boundary condition. The recent\nanalytical work of Brooks et al. [3] appears to support the van Sciver model for forced flow\n\nin wide ducts when wall heating is imposed, However, the present case has different thermal\nboundary conditions. Further the wide duct equations cannot be applied directly to the\npresent powder of the heater system. Nevertheless certain qualitative features appear to agree\nwith the modified van Sciver theory which is adopted for interpretation.\n\n15\n\n9\n\nTo v a c u u m p u m p\n\nFEP f ( o w o u t l e t\n\nmea sur ing lines\n\nFEP\n\nt2r\n\nVacuum\n\ncant\nc\n\nF i g u r e 5 . 1 .

William Chen has proposed (1987)" to prevent excessive leakage\nusing a termination plug of suitable dimensions in order to cut down significantly the outflow\nrate of thermal energy. The termination plug has the purpose of keeping the heat inside and\nof raising the energetic effectiveness of the pump as much as possible. The plug at the downstream end has to be of sufficiently small pore size to "leak" little heat. Further it should permit passage of the liquid flow rate. Therefore, it ought to be not too thick.\nA particular question relates to the necessity of a termination plug upstream of the\npump plug. At this location, second law-induced heat flow through solid walls and grains\ncannot be prevented entirely for fine porous plugs. Further, the liquid in the plug travels in a\ndirection opposite to the second law heat flow. One may object that the ideal superleak (ISL)\ntype models do not permit this type of simplified naive description. However Wilks points\nout in his book (Wilks 1967) [4] that there is always a departure from an ideal ISL condition,\neven in very good plugs with near-ideal vortex pinning capability.** Thus, the need for an\nupstream termination plug, at this stage of our knowledge, appears to be less urgent than the\noption for a downstream termination plug proposed by William Chen.\n\n*M.Sc. Thesis, UCLA 1987.\n\n**"... Even in the narrowest slits the flow of superfluid will be accompanied by a flow of normal fluid. This\nwill vanish only in the limiting case of an infinitely narrow slit; hence the helium leaving the vessel will never\nbe at absolute zero." [41\n18\n\n6.\n\nENERGETICS IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON Th4 FORCE USE\nIn this section the thennomechanics is inspected first by consideration of historical\n\ntrends in magnet technology with "hybridf He I1 - He I systems, and in space systems. Both\ndevelopments took place nearly simultaneously, but by and large somewhat independent of\neach other.\nThe magnet emling p c e s s e s have been initially promoted by the "lambda cooler"\narrangement of Roubeau. Roubeau received the Mendelssohn Award for his contributions\nfrom the ICEC in 1986 [5]. The system is referred to as "lambda cooler", because very simple means of pumping permit the attainment of the lambda temperature of He II in magnets\nand other domains to be cooled. A very compact system may result. For large scale magnet\napplications, such as the "Tore Supra" however, there has to be a stable bath temperature with\nsufficiently large temperature stability within the He I1 range. Therefore Claudet, Bon Mardion, Seyfert, Verdier [6] and others were instrumental in modifying the Roubeau type system\nto get to lower temperatures. Additional system examples are the versions of LBL 171 and\nHakuraku et al. [8]. It is noted that a characteristic feature is the use of JT throttling converting He I to He II and using the latent heat of vaporization as a powerful means of lowering\nthe temperature.\n\nThe space developments in the low-T area include the IRAS flight system (mentioned\nabove) which is a "passive" system. It is called passive as there is no active refrigerator\nincorporated. Further, the term "active" is used for VLPS when a controller permits variations\nof the thermal energy rejection rate while maintaining stable temperatures in the space dewar.\n\nA very important feature of space systems may be the lack of a vacuum pump which uses a\nsizable amount of power for large magnets in terrestrial installations.\n\n19\n\nThe use of TM forces appears to have been proposed explicitly first by Hofmann\n\n(1986) 121. Several items may be distinguished in the area of his proposals. One problem\narea is the cooling of the superconducting winding package proper. It may be done internally\nand/or externally using a heat sink. Another problem area is the current lead cooling, the\ncooling of neck tube sections and other items of this nature. The third item is the refrigerator\nitself. While all of these points appear to be touched upon in Hofmann\'s proposed systems,\nthe emphasis has been on a particular experimental setup for which data or calculated results\n\nhave been obtained (Hofmann et al., 1Y87) 191. -w%iie interesting R&D\n\nwurk\n\nis k i n g per-\n\nformed for magnets near 2 K, there appear to be similar opportunities for space systems with\naltered specifications, e.g. low mass at launch.\n\nSpecific Space-Related TM Force Use. Because of distinctly altered boundary conditions in micro-gravity, the evolution of TM force utilization has different features. A particular point is the initial concentration on VLPS developments mentioned above. The future\noptions of modified TM systems include all of the various subunits which have been discussed\n\nso far for various purposes:\nvapor-liquid phase separation using the TM force fountain effect transfer pumps (FEP\nunits);\nFEP use as "power unit" for vortex refrigeration;\nmechano-caloric devices;\ncyclic He I1 vortex refrigerator systems;\nheat leak interception devices.\nA single TM device may be combined with other components for improvements. The\nexample chosen is heat leak interception. Heat input is used to drive a fountain effect pump\n(FEP) unit located at the "heat leaking" component. In principle, solar photons and "hot"\nparts in the space system may supply the heat. In telescope cryovessels filled with He 11, the\nfocal plane assembly and related sensor dissipation constitutes a thermal load on the liquid.\n\n20\n\nFurther, support struts have a small, but finite heat input.\nFigure 6.1 is a schematic diagram of heat leak interception example along a support\nrod surrounded by a porous medium which acts as the core of the fountain effect pump (FEP).\nThe incoming heat is diverted to the liquid in a manner which is quite similar to vent tube\ncooling by escaping vapor in "classical" cryovessels. At the warm end, the He 1 action is\n1\nterminated theoretically when the lambda temperature is reached. An alternative, indicated on\nthe left hand side of Figure 6.1, is the routing of the escaping mass into a lambda shield. The\nexperiments of Hofmann et al. [9]indicate that locally He I states may be reached without\nannihilating He I1 TM forces. On the right hand side of Figure 6.1 this possibility is indicated. There is a continued He I coolant flow (and subsequently vapor flow) as the escaping\nmass moves along the rod. On the cold side, the thermal energy to be rejected is the product\nof temperature times entropy at the low temperature (ST). Thus as the vessel temperature is\nlowered a smaller and smaller heat rejection is required. Obviously, there is a chance to\nintegrate the heat leak interception with VLPS.\nFigure 6.2 is a schematic diagram of a system which uses an interior fluid-filled\ncylinder for venting. The liquid is to enter a VLPS plug. At the downstream side of this\nVLPS unit the vapor is removed in the usual way. Installation of these units will produce a\n1\nlower overall heat input imposed on the vessel\'s He 1 . Attractiveness of the various options\nwill depend on the enthalpy difference handled by the system.\nThe possibility of refrigeration by means of heat input has been known as "He I1 vorI\n\nI\n\n-\n\n.\n\ntex cooler" demonstrated first by Staas and Severijns [ 101. The cycle envisioned (Figure 6.3)\nas the simplest case comprises ideal state changes in ideal superleaks (ISL) and in ideal isobaric heat exchangers (dP = 0).\n\nThus, the sequence is ISL-P-ISL-P, where the first ISL\n\nachieves ideal thermomechanical pressure increase, and the second ISL permits mechanocaloric cooling. The cycle has very sharp "corners" in the temperture-entropy diagram (Figure\n\n21\n\nA-\n\nShield\n\nPOROUS\nMEDIUM\n\nROD\n\nMASS FLOW RATE\n\nm\n\nll\ni\n\nFig. 6.1.

More explicitly, the small area requires only a limited amount of flow power.\nThe sharp changes in dT/dS at the entrance to the first ISL and at the entrance to the second\nISL unit point out that great care is needed in het exhanger sizing. In real systems, heat cannot be supplied easily at T-S loctions with zero entropy change. Thus, compact heat\nexchangers are a necessity for efficient vortex refrigeration.\n\nIt is noted that these systems have no moving parts and permit novel device developments for space systems based on the thermomechanical and the mechano-caloric effect.\n\n.\n\nReturning to the question of details of efficient heat leak interception, we note that competing\nschemes are created (as indicated in Figures 6.2 and 6.2). There appears to be a chance to\nimplement miniaturized vortex refrigeration in order to keep heat out of the vessel while energizing with the external heat input.\n\nc\n\nWe acknowledge the comments of Dr. Sidney Yuan and input of Herbert Simanjuntak.\n\n.\n\n25\n\n7, REFERENCES\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nA.

C : DEFINITIONS\n\nPOROUS PLUG IDENTIFICATION AND THROUGHPUT PARAMETERS\nThe initial years of porous plug work focused on vapor-liquid phase separation with\nrather large physical dimensions of sintered plugs. For instance 1 in. diameter (2.54 cm)\nplugs and 112 in. O.D. plugs have been used. An example is given in Figure C.l. The first\nitem, is the source of the plug (manufacturer, distributor). The second number is the nominal\nfiltration rating, i.e. the particle size retained during filtration usually involving fluid-solid\nThe third item is the material, e.g.\n\nseparation.\n\ns = stainless steel. The fourth number is the\n\nidentification number for the particular plug of the type specified by the first three pieces of\ninformation. The fifth number is the diameter of the plug. The sixth figure is the thickness.\n\nO r recent emphasis of other plug applications has introduced smaller permeabilities.\nu\nTherefore, a different classification scheme has been used called category I1 (Figure C.2).\nThe dimensions at the end of the identification sequence are given in mm. An example is\nPK 10 S 02\n\n-\n\n6.4 x 7.5. The diameter of this example of category I1 is 6.4 111111, and the\n\nthickness is 0.75 mm.\nThe throughput capability measure, preferred in our work is th Darcy permeability (K)\n\nor its reciprocal value (1/~)\nwhich is a d.c. resistance measure. However, other quantities are\nused in the literature. An example is the "F" factor of Petrac (Low Temp. Phys. LT 14, ed.\n\nM. Krusius, M. Vuorio, North Holland, Vol. 4, 1975, p. 33).\nQ = W, = F A AP\n\nW, = refrigeration capacity ( = heat flow rate), A area, AP pressure difference. The heat transported is formulated as the product of the normal fluid velocity times the porosity, A and\n\np , where p is the mean entropy per unit volume.\nm\nm\n\n43\n\nCATEGORY\n\nI\n\nZE\n\nPLUG #\n\nNLESS STEEL\n\nFig. C . l .\n\nDIAMETER\n\nNO.l\n\nHATERIAL\n\nTHICKfIESS\n\nD = ~ = I inch\n\nPorous plug i d e n t i f i c a t i o n system\n\nCATEGORY I1\nEXAMPLE\n\nI\n\nPLUG #\nPORE S I Z E \' p\nU\n\nI\n\nP\n1\n\nMANUFACTURER\n\n10\n\nBZ\n\n/\n01\n\nL\n\nDIAMETER, mm\n\n-\n\n/\n6.4\n\nx\n\n0.8\n\\\n\nTHICKNESS\n\nMATER IAL\nBRONZE\n\nFig. C.2.

(Rev. Sci. Instru. 41, 147, 1971). The factor is denoted as "2" ( = d.c. flow impedance\n\nfactor).\n\n2 = AP/(Vq)\n\nq = shear viscosity, V volumetric flow rate. The Z factor is related to the Darcy permeability by\n\nz= K-\'L/A\nL thickness of plug (or length of flow path). An example in the area of porous media has\n.I\n\nbeen given by Ahlers and Singsaas (Phys. Rev. B19, 1984, 4951). The powder system of\nthese authors is for the establishment of fountain pressure differences. The K-values are on\nthe order of lo-" cm2.\n\n.\n\nAPP. D\n\nTHERMOMETER CALIBRATION AT VERY SMALL\nTEMPERATURE DIFFERENCES\nThe carbon resistor thermometers used are Allen - Bradley, 39 Ohm, resistors. The\ncalibration procedure involves the measuring of the thermometer\'s resistance and the\ncorresponding vapor pressure of the system. The properties of the thermometer are such that\nthe resistance is approximately logarithmically proportional to the vapor pressure. This can be\nexpressed as:\n\nIn (R) = a h (pv) + b\n\nTherefore, by using a temperature-vapor pressure curve, such as the T-58 scale, the\ntemperature versus resistance relationship is derived for small temperature difference. A printout of a sample computer program and its output shows the utilization of a T-58 cubic spline\nfit (fit presented by Donnelly, R.J., et al in J. Low Temp. Phys., 1981) for iterative resistancetemperature calculations (Tables D1 and D2).\nFor very small T-differences, the calibration equation (D.l) permits a convenient determination of AT from the resistance difference AFL The slope of the vapor pressure curve is\nknown from the T-58 scale:\n\nI?\n\n=\'\n;\nP\n\ndF\'JdT\n\nInserting d In R/d In Pv = a = (dR/R)/(dPJW one obtains\nAT = AR dT/dR = M ( R ) \'\naTAT cc T\nR = h\n\n(D.3)\n\nR = R, at the bath temperature.\n\n46\n\n200\n210\n\n220\n230\n235\n760\n\nG O a B 3&0\n\nIF AES(D(1)-P) < .000001 T E N 390\nFEU\nIF D(ili?
