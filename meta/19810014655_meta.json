Three drive assemblies were tested for a total of about three hours of which approximately one hour was at nominal full speed and full power conditions. Peak efficiency of 60 percent was determined. There was no evidence of slippage between rollers for any of the conditions tested. The ball drive, a version using balls instead of one row of rollers, and having a 3.25:1 reduction ratio, failed to perform satisfactorily.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810014655, "id": "4520cc9d981a439bb961754650cf29a6", "publicationDate": "1981-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810014655.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810014655/downloads/19810014655.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810014655/downloads/19810014655.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810014655/downloads/19810014655.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
