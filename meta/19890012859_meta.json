Evidence was described from structures in the ferrigenous quartzite within the schist belt for two periods of nearly coaxial isoclinal folding attributable to E-W compression. This folding was followed by collapse of the F sub 1/F sub 2 folds, forming open F sub 3 folds with NNE-SSW axes. Finally, a period of N-S shortening caused a broad warping of the earlier N-S trending fold axes. There is evidence within the gneisses for shearing produced by similar, nearly E-W compression.", "title": "Structural evolution of the Kolar Schist Belt, South India", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T23:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890012859, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mukhopahyay, Dilip K."}, "organization": {"name": "Roorkee Univ."}}, "id": "58aa959cfd0f47318994bab376f20eef"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890012859, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890012859, "id": "270211c8f1d04094a02bafd77ad4c5dc", "publicationName": "Lunar and Planetary Inst., Workshop on the Deep Continental Crust of South India", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890012859.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890012859/downloads/19890012859.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890012859/downloads/19890012859.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890012859/downloads/19890012859.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
