b"June 1968\n\n\t\nBrief 68-10217\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\nNASA Tech Briefs are issued to summarize specifi\xc3\xaa innovations derived from the U.S. space program,\nto encourage their commercial application. Copies are available to the public at 15 cents each\nfrom the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information, Springfield, Virginia 22151.\n\nComputer Program Offers New Method for Constructing \r\nPeriodic Orbits in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems\nThe problem:\nTo develop a method for constructing precisely\nperiodic orbits which, at the start, dynamically approximates solutions that converge to precise dynamical solutions in the limit of the sequence. Previous methods isolated orbits with a sequence of precise\ndynamical solutions which at the start of the sequence\nhas only approximate periodicity but which converges\nto a periodic solution in the limit of the sequence.\nThe solution:\nA computer program that utilizes an iterative\nmethod for constructing periodic orbits in nonlinear\ndynamical systems.\nHow it's done:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The method used in this program is a modification\nof the generalized Newton-Raphson algorithm used\nin analyzing two point boundary problems. This\ntechnique is distinct in that it constructs a sequence\nof precisely periodic but, at the start, dynamically\napproximate solutions that converge to a precise dynamical solution in the limit of the sequence. The\niterates are solutions of a linear system derived from\nthe dynamical equations of motion. For conservative\nHamiltonian systems, stability of the periodic orbit is\ndetermined as a byproduct of the method of iterating\nan orbit. Along the periodic orbit the trace of the\nresolvent (fundamental matrix) of the equations of\n\nvariation determines uniquely the characteristic exponents of the orbit. An approximation to the resolvent\nalong each iterate is determined in the solution of the\nlinear system.\nNotes:\nI. This program is written in Fortran H for use on the\nIBM 360, Model 65 computer.\n2. This program can be used in nonaerospace as well\nas aerospace calculations of periodic orbits in\neither circular or elliptic restricted three-body\nproblems to develop qualitative information for\nspace flight missions as well as detailed trajectories\nfor motions of deep space stations in earth-moon\nsystems.\n3. Inquiries concerning this program may be made to:\nCOSMIC\nComputer Center\nUniversity of Georgia\nAthens, Georgia 30601\nReference: B68-10217\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: Arthur G.
