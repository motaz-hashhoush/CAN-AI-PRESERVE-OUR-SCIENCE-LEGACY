b'--\n\nRobotic Hand\n\nS\n\nSPACE-USE ROBOTIC\nSYSTEMS BECOME\n\nhown below is the OmniHand, a robotic hand for\nwhich its developers claim\n"capabilities virtually identical\nto those of the human hand."\nThe multiple digit hand features\nan opposable thumb and a flexible wrist. Electric muscles,\n1 called MinnacsTM,\npower wrist\njoints and the completely interchangeable digits.\nThe Omni-Hand was developed by Ross-Hime Designs,\nInc., Minneapolis, Minnesota for\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nunder a NASA Small Business\nInnovation Research (SBIR)\ncontract. Two Omni-Hands\nhave been delivered to NASA\nfor evaluation and potential\n\nCOMMERCIAL. PRODUCTS\n\nP u b l ~ cSafety\n\nuse on space missions. The unit\nis also commercially available\nfor such applications as hazardous materials handling and\nmanufacturing automation.\nRoss-Hime Designs had\nearlier developed for NASA,\nunder SBIR contracts with\nLangley Research Center,\nsystems known as 0mni-wristTM\nand Omni-Wrist I1 that are also\ncommercially available for such\napplications as spray painting,\nsealing, ultrasonic testing and\na variety of nuclear industry,\naerospace and military use.\nA relatively new company\nformed in 1987, Ross-Hime\nhas patented a number of\nrobotic mechanisms with\n\nhumanlike "singularity-free"\nmotion (singularity is a\nphenomenon of robotics that\ncan cause a joint to jam as it\nattempts to move in an area\nwhere it has no axis of rotation\nor range of motion). The\ncompany has conducted development programs under four\nSBIR contracts. In addition to\nOmni-Hand and Omni-Wrist,\nits robotic products include a\nDextrous Arm and the Minnac\nelectric muscle. a\nOmni-Wrist and Minnac are trademarks of Ross-Hime Designs, Inc.\n\n'
