b'Security System Software\n\nS\n\nA NASA SOFTWARE\nTOOL IS A KEY\n\noftware House, Waltham,\nMassachusetts manufactures\nphysical security systems for\na wide range of government and\nbusiness users (below). These\nsystems include many types of\nsecurity devices, such as card\nvalidation, alarm monitoring,\nvideo badging\nclosed circuit TV,\nand biometric identification\nsystems.\nSoftware House\'s primary\nsecurity management system is\nThe\nthe CoCURESystem 1 plusTM;\nphoto at right shows the\nCoCURESystem 1 Plus family of\nproducts. The software based\nsystem may be used with a variety of access control hardware at\ninstallations ranging from indi-\n\nELEMENT OF A\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nmultiple integrated networks\naround the\nworld. Advanced\nsoftware\nprograms enable\nCl CURESystem\n1 Plus users to\nmanage large\namounts of information and to solve unique\nsecurity problems; they also\nprovide power over access\ncontrol with time schedules,\nauthorization levels, door entry\nwith card validation, and extensive reporting capabilities.\nIn addition, C\xc2\xb0CURESystem\n\n1 Plus provides access to other\ninformation management tools,\nsuch as the NASA expert development tool named CLIPS.\nUsing CLIPS, Software House\nintegrates software and hardware\nto solve problems that might\narise with the various access\ncontrol systems. The expert\nsystem software prototype asks\na series of questions about what\nthe hardware is doing or not\ndoing; from the given answers,\nthe program makes recornmendations on possible routes to\ncheck and what might be\ncausing the problem. CLIPS\nenabled Software House to\ndevelop new generations of\nhardware that allow problem\nsolution by a non-expert person\nwith fast response.\nCLIPS was developed by\nJohnson Space Center and\nwas supplied to Software\nHouse by the Computer Software Management and Information Center (COSMIC)\', a\nNASA-sponsored mechanism\nfor making available at nominal\ncost government-developed\ncomputer programs that have\nsecondary applicability (see\npage 140).\nTM C-CURESystem 1 Plus is a trademark\nof Software House.\n\n"\n\nCOSMIC is a registered trademark of\nthe National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.\n\nP u b l i c Salety\n\n'
