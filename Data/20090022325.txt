Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA multiple-throat venturi system has been\ninvented for measuring laminar flow of air\nor other gas at low speed (1 to 30 cm/s) in\na duct while preserving the laminar nature\nof the flow and keeping the velocity profile\nacross the duct as nearly flat as possible.\nWhile means for measuring flows at higher\nspeeds are well established, heretofore,\nthere have been no reliable means for making consistent, accurate measurements in\nthis speed range. In the original application\nfor which this system was invented, the duct\nleads into the test section of a low-speed\nwind tunnel wherein uniform, low-speed,\nlaminar flow is required for scientific experiments. The system could also be used to\nmonitor a slow flow of gas in an industrial\nprocess like chemical vapor deposition.\nIn the original application, the multiple-throat venturi system is mounted at the\ninlet end of the duct having a rectangular\ncross section of 19 by 14 cm, just upstream\nof an assembly of inlet screens and flow\nstraighteners that help to suppress undesired flow fluctuations (see Figure 1). The\nbasic venturi measurement principle is\nwell established: One measures the difference in pressure between (1) a point just\noutside the inlet, where the pressure is\nhighest and the kinetic energy lowest; and\n(2) the narrowest part (the throat) of the\nventuri passage, where the kinetic energy\nis highest and the pressure is lowest. Then\nby use of Bernoulli\xe2\x80\x99s equation for the relationship between pressure and kinetic energy, the volumetric flow speed in the duct\ncan be calculated from the pressure difference and the inlet and throat widths.\nThe design of this system represents a\ncompromise among length, pressure recovery, uniformity of flow, and complexity of assembly. Traditionally, venturis are\nused to measure faster flows in narrower\ncross sections, with longer upstream and\ndownstream passages to maintain accuracy. The dimensions of the passages of\nthe present venturi system are sized to\nprovide a readily measurable pressure\ndrop. Multiple throats are used to minimize the length needed to recover internal energy and enable the velocity profile\nto recover to near flatness. The venturi\npassages are defined by airfoil surfaces,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\nVenturi\nSystem\n\nFlow-Tunnel\nTest Section\nManifold\nAirfoil\n\nPressure Tubes\n\nAssembly\nContaining\nInlet Screens\nand Flow\nStraighteners\n\nPressure\nTransducer\n\nFigure 1.

A plenum downstream of the trailing edges allows the flow\nto even out prior to entering the screens\nand flow straighteners. To enable measurement of pressure in all six throats,\n\ntubes in three of the airfoils are connected\nto a manifold, and narrow holes connecting the tubes with the throats are drilled in\nthese airfoils. The pressures sensed at the\nsix throat measurement locations become\naveraged together in the manifold, which\nis connected to one side of a sensitive differential-pressure transducer. The other\nside of the transducer is exposed to the\npressure just upstream of the inlet. It has\nbeen found that the speed-vs.-pressure calibration curve is highly repeatable, en-\n\nabling measurement of flow speed to\nwithin an error of \xc2\xb10.2 cm/s.\nThis work was done by Frank Quinn and\nKevin Magee of ZIN Technologies, Inc. for\nGlenn Research Center.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nAn instrumentation system for direct\nmeasurement of the thermal conductivity of a small sample of a highly insulating material has been devised. As used\nhere, (1) \xe2\x80\x9csmall\xe2\x80\x9d signifies having dimensions of the order of two centimeters \xe2\x80\x94\nsignificantly less than the sizes of specimens for which prior devices for direct\nmeasurement of thermal conductivity\nhave been designed; and (2) \xe2\x80\x9chighly insulating\xe2\x80\x9d signifies having thermal conductivity of the order of that of air.\nThe heart of the system is an assembly\nthat includes two copper disks \xe2\x80\x94 one\nelectrically heated, the other cooled\nwith chilled water. The disks are separated by a guard ring made of strong,\nthermally insulating polymethacrylamide foam. The sample fits between\nthe copper disks and within the ring (see\nfigure). Matched thermocouples are\nused to measure the temperatures of the\nheated and cooled disks. The heated\nand cooled disks are affixed to larger\nfoam disks, and the essentially still air in\nthe gap between the larger disks insulates the sides of the specimen. This air\ngap region can be further divided by extending the foam ring into the gap region. The entire assembly as described\nthus far is lightly clamped together by\nmeans of nylon threaded rods and is\nplaced inside a cylindrical chamber\nwherein the temperature is maintained\nat a set value (typically, 25 \xc2\xb0C).\nThe electric power supplied to the\nheated disk is adjusted to maintain the\ntemperature of this disk at a fixed value\n(for example, 35 \xc2\xb0C) that exceeds the\ntemperature in the chamber by a fixed\namount. Similarly, the supply of chilled\nwater to the cooled disk is regulated to\nmaintain the temperature in this disk at a\n\n6\n\nDiameter 1.0\n\nThickness\n1.5\n\nFoam Disk\n\nHeated Copper Disk\nFoam\nGuard Ring\n\nSample\nCooled Copper Disk\n\nFoam Disk\n\nThickness 0.1875\nThickness 0.159\nThickness 0.1875\n\nThickness\n1.5\n\nDiameter 2.8\n\nThis Assembly is Mounted in a constant-temperature chamber. The heated and cooled disks are maintained at temperatures \xce\x94T/2 above and \xce\x94T/2 below, respectively, the chamber temperature. The thermal conductivity of the sample is determined from the heater power needed to maintain the \xce\x94T/2\ntemperature differential of the heated disk. (Note: The dimensions are in inches.)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\nvalue (in the present example, 15 \xc2\xb0C)\nbelow the chamber temperature by the\nsame fixed amount. Modeling shows that\nthe resulting symmetry in the temperature differential, in combination with the\ngeometric symmetry of the apparatus,\nserves to ensure that heat escaping from\nthe edge of the heated disk flows through\nthe air-gap region and, for the most part,\nreturns to the edge of the cooled disk. It\nalso ensures that the heat escaping from\nthe half of the guard ring that is positioned toward the heated disk flows to the\nhalf of the guard ring positioned towards\nthe cooled disk. This helps to assure onedimensional heat flow through the sample, thereby minimizing the measurement errors. The time-averaged heater\npower needed to maintain the specified\nconstant temperature of the heated disk\nin the steady state is what is measured.\nThe following description of the theory of operation and the calculation of\n\nthermal conductivity from measurement\ndata is somewhat simplified for the sake\nof brevity. The heater power is nominally\ngiven by\nQ = kA\xce\x94T/l + QL,\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity of\nthe sample material under test, A is the\ncross-sectional area of the sample (nominally, the area of the circle enclosed by\nthe guard ring), \xce\x94T is the specified difference between the temperatures of the\nheated and cooled disks, l is the thickness of the sample, and QL is the rate of\nleakage of heat along all paths other\nthan that of direct one-dimensional\nthermal conduction through the thickness of the sample.\nModeling shows that the combination\nof temperature-differential and geometric symmetry and the one-dimensional\nheat flow through the sample ensures\nthat the heat-leakage power is essentially\nindependent of the sample material.\n\nHence, it is possible to determine the\nvalue of QL as a function of the heated\ndisk, cooled disk, and chamber wall temperatures from calibration measurements on one or more specimens having\nknown thermal conductivities. Modeling\nalso shows that the device may be calibrated using air as the reference standard material. Thereafter, one can use\nthe value of QL as thus determined to\ncalculate values of k from measured values of Q.\nThis work was done by Robert A Miller\nand Maria A Kuczmarski of Glenn Research Center.

A visible laser beam locates focal\npoints of the conic reflector. Measuring\ntotal diverging power from a THz point\nsource is not an easy task. THz radiation\nhas a wavelength range of between 0.1\nand 1 mm. The power levels range from\na few tens of nW to 100 mW. These\npower levels are low, and low temperatures (in the range of \xe2\x80\x93173 \xc2\xb0C) are typically used to house the THz power\nsource. Because of the small target, the\npower emitter and the power detectors\nmust be located in exact positions in\norder to fully capture the radiated energy. At these low powers, there are\nthree common commercial power meters: a bolometer detector, a Golay Cell,\nand a Keating Meter. These three power\nmeters have specific power ranges where\nthey excel, and they must be calibrated at\ntheir overlapped power ranges. Because\nof the low THz power being measured,\nconical reflectors are used to send all of\nthe radiated power to the detectors.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\nHe-Ne\nLaser\n\nX3\nFolding Mirror\n(Replaced by TI\nMicro-Mirror)\n\nVirtual Point\nSource\n(Where\nPower\nMeter Will\nBe Inserted)\n\nLens\n\nEllipsoidal\nmirror\n\nAlignment Jig\n\nCryostat\nWindow\nTHz\nHorn\nCryostat\nCold Plate\n\nFigure 1.

(a) Quantification of Optical Aberration as intorduced by an arbitrary lens is manifested by\namplitude of its Zernicke coefficients specified in the order of (n= 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.: m=\xe2\x80\x93n, . . . ,0, . . . , n\nif n even ; \xe2\x80\x93n, . . . , n if n odd). (b) First 10 individual Zernicke functions are plotted.\n\nThese reflectors focus the energy of the\nTHz source, and the detectors are placed\nat a convergent focal point to capture\nthe radiated THz power.\n\nOne cannot place the detectors just by\napproximating by eye. THz waves are\nsubmillimeter, and require precise\nplacement. The method proposed here\n\nis to use a visible low-power red laser\n(630 nm) with a 1-mm beam diameter\n(see Figure 1). The laser is beamed\nthrough a 3\xc3\x97 beam expander to obtain a\ncircular beam, then through a lens in\norder to focus the beam onto a TI DLP\nmicro-mirror at an angle. This mirror\nbounces the laser light onto an ellipsoidal mirror that will focus it into a\npoint. That is the point where the THz\nsource is to be placed.\nThe initial focal point (laser source) is\nmarked in 3D space as if the TI micromirror wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there. This virtual focal\npoint is where the detector is to be\nplaced. Since a circular beam is used, it\nis easier to locate the focal points by\nwatching for the bright red spot that signals beam convergence.\nOnce the two focal points are found,\nand the energy source and energy detectors are in place, it is necessary to check\ncalibration. Array of circular patterns can\nbe beamed from the DLP chip to evaluate Zernike\xe2\x80\x99s refraction aberrations in\nreal time (see Figure 2). In addition, various diagnostic patterns can be beamed\nfrom the DLP chip in order to measure\naberrations associated with field variation. For example, a spot diagram can be\nbeamed off of the DLP in order to analyze point spread.\nThis method is useful for the semiconductor industry to evaluate surface\nmetrology of thin transparent optics,\nclinical optometry to measure lens aberration, telescopes and astronomical receivers to align mirrors covering optics\nand radiation sources, and head-mount\ndisplays to evaluate beam splitters.\nThis work was done by Hamid H. Javadi of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1).\n\nAutoignition Chamber for Remote Testing of Pyrotechnic Devices\nThis rugged, reusable chamber is portable and can remotely heat pyrotechnics for autoignition tests.\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe autoignition chamber (AIC) performs by remotely heating pyrotechnic\ndevices that can fit the inner diameter of\nthe tube furnace. Two methods, a cold\nstart or a hot start, can be used with this\ndevice in autoignition testing of pyrotechnics. A cold start means extending a pyrotechnic device into the cold autoignition\nchamber and then heating the device\nuntil autoignition occurs. A hot start\nmeans heating the autoignition chamber\n\n8\n\nto a specified temperature, and then extending the device into a hot autoignition\nchamber until autoignition occurs. Personnel are remote from the chamber during the extension into the hot chamber.\nThe autoignition chamber, a commercially produced tubular furnace, has a 230V, single-phase, 60-Hz electrical supply,\nwith a total power output of 2,400 W. It has\na 6-in. (15.2-cm) inner diameter, a 12-in.\n(30.4-cm) outer diameter and a 12-in.-\n\nlong (30.4-cm), single-zone, solid tubular\nfurnace (element) capable of heating to\ntemperatures up to 2,012 \xc2\xbaF (1,100 \xc2\xbaC) in\nair. The furnace temperature is controlled\nby a commercial single-zone, setpoint temperature controller and solid-state relay.\nThe furnace features a stainless steel\nshell with 1/4-in.-thick (6-mm) steel\nend plates, and a rugged insulation\npackage. A thermocouple port is supplied in the center of the control zone.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\nThe furnace has a 2.5-in.-long (6.4-cm)\nvestibule at the top and bottom. The approximate overall length of the furnace\nis 17.5 in. (44.5 cm). Thermocouples on\nthe pyrotechnic device monitor its temperature during the heating process on\na strip chart recorder, or an equivalent\ndata acquisition system. A remotely actuated ceramic protective cover is installed on top of the auto ignition chamber when test personnel are working\naround it.\nA cage is mounted to a 115-VAC 500-lb\n(2,224-N) force electromechanical actua-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\ntor that has an 18-in. (46-cm) stroke. The\npyrotechnic device is installed in an appropriate mounting fixture, which is then installed in the cage. The actuator can be remotely operated to extend or retract the\npyrotechnic device into the tube furnace.\nWhen the actuator is completely extended\ninto the autoignition chamber, a ceramic\ninsulating lid sits on top of the chamber to\nkeep heat from escaping.\nAn accelerometer is installed on the\nstainless steal fixture of the electromechanical actuator to record the autoignition event. A strip chart recorder,\n\nor equivalent data acquisition system,\nmonitors the accelerometer output. The\nchamber is capable of withstanding\nstress while still being able to function.\nIn one instance of STS-107 Pyrotechnic\nHardware, the autoignition chamber\nwas reused a total of 18 times and did\nnot require rebuilding.\nThis work was done by Maureen L. Harrington and Gerald R. Steward of Johnson\nSpace Center, and Toby W. Dartez of Jacobs\nSverdrup Corp. For further information, contact the JSC Innovation Partnerships Office\nat (281) 483-3809. MSC-24433-1\n\n9\n\nElectronics/Computers\nMicrowave Power Combiners for Signals of Arbitrary Amplitude\nOutput polarization would no longer vary with input amplitudes.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nSchemes for combining power from\ncoherent microwave sources of arbitrary\n(unequal or equal) amplitude have been\nproposed. Most prior microwave-powercombining schemes are limited to\nsources of equal amplitude.\nThe basic principle of the schemes\nnow proposed is to use quasi-optical\ncomponents to manipulate the polarizations and phases of two arbitrary-amplitude input signals in such a way as to\ncombine them into one output signal\nhaving a specified, fixed polarization. To\ncombine power from more than two\nsources, one could use multiple powercombining stages based on this principle, feeding the outputs of lower-power\nstages as inputs to higher-power stages.\nQuasi-optical components suitable for\nimplementing these schemes include\ngrids of parallel wires, vane polarizers,\nand a variety of waveguide structures.\nFor the sake of brevity, the remainder of\nz\n\ny\n(Perpendicular\nto Page)\n\nthis article illustrates the basic principle\nby focusing on one scheme in which a\nwire grid and two vane polarizers would\nbe used.\nWire grids are the key quasi-optical elements in many prior equal-power combiners. In somewhat oversimplified\nterms, a wire grid reflects an incident\nbeam having an electric field parallel to\nthe wires and passes an incident beam\nhaving an electric field perpendicular to\nthe wires. In a typical prior equal-power\ncombining scheme, one provides for two\nproperly phased, equal-amplitude signals having mutually perpendicular linear polarizations to impinge from two\nmutually perpendicular directions on a\nwire grid in a plane oriented at an angle\nof 45\xc2\xb0 with respect to both beam axes.\nThe wires in the grid are oriented to\npass one of the incident beams straight\nthrough onto the output path and to reflect the other incident beam onto the\nx-Polarized Out\nx-Polarized Output Beam\ntput\n\nx\nSecond Vane Polarizer\nVane\n\nCircularly Polarized Intermediate Beam\n\nFirst Vane Polarizer\nVane\ne\nInput B\nBeam 2\nAmplit\ntude\nAmplitude E2\ny-Pola\ny-Polarized\narized\n\nWire Grid\nat 45\xc2\xb0\n4\n\nSource 2\n\nTermination To Dissipate\nTermination To\nResidual (Leakage)\nR id l (L k\n)\nPolarization Components\nInput Beam 1\nAmplitude E1\nx-Polarized\nx-Polarized\nSource 1\n\nPower From Two Input Beams of possibly unequal amplitude would be combined with minimal loss,\nprovided that the input beams were properly phased and polarized and the vane polarizers were\nproperly positioned and oriented.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\noutput path along with the first-mentioned beam.\nIn the ideal case, the output beam\ncontains the sum of the input beam powers and has linear polarization at an\nangle of 45\xc2\xb0 with respect to either of the\ninput polarizations. Although ordinarily\nused to combine input signals of equal\namplitude, this scheme still works when\nthe amplitudes are unequal, except that\nundesirably, the output polarization is\nnot fixed at 45\xc2\xb0: instead, the angle of the\noutput polarization, relative to the polarization of input signal 1, is given by\narctan(E1/E2), where E1 and E2 are the\nelectric-field amplitudes of the first and\nsecond input signals, respectively. According to the scheme now proposed,\none would use a wire-grid combiner as in\nthe equal-power case described above, in\ncombination with two vane polarizers\n(see figure) that, as described below,\nwould ensure that the output beam had\nthe desired 45\xc2\xb0 linear polarization.\nA vane polarizer (also known as a venetian-blind polarizer) consists of a\nnumber of thin metal strips that are parallel to each other. When the electric\nfield of an incident beam is perpendicular to the strips, the field does not induce any electric current in the strips\nand so the beam passes through the\nstrips, unaffected, in the transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode. When the\nelectric field is parallel to the strips, the\nbeam is forced into the first transverse\nelectric (TE1) mode, which has a wavelength longer than that of the TEM\nmode. The thickness of the vane polarizer is chosen so that the TEM mode is\ndelayed by a phase difference of 90\xc2\xb0\nmore than that of the TE1 mode. When\nthe incident beam is polarized at 45\xc2\xb0 to\nthe vanes, the beam is split into two\nequal components, one of which is delayed by 90\xc2\xb0 relative to the other. Upon\nrecombination of the components at the\noutput, the resultant beam is circularly\npolarized. Conversely, when the incident\nbeam is circularly polarized, the output\nbeam is linearly polarized at 45\xc2\xb0.\nIn the proposed scheme, the two vane\npolarizers would be placed in the output\n\n11\n\npath of the wire-grid combiner. The first\nvane polarizer would be oriented with its\nvanes at 45\xc2\xb0 with respect to the polarization of the combined input beam, so\nthat the output of the first vane polarizer\nwould be circularly polarized. The second vane polarizer would convert the\ncircular polarization to linear and would\nbe oriented to place the final output polarization at a desired, standard angle.\nFixing the polarization at a standard\n\nangle would facilitate the assembly of\nmultiple stages to combine power from\nmore than two sources.\nProper phasing is essential to the success of the proposed scheme. The phasing problem is somewhat more complex\nthan in the case of a simple equal-power\ncombiner because propagation through\nand between the vane polarizers introduces additional phase shift. However,\nthis is not a serious problem because the\n\nmajority of the phase shift is a predictable\nfunction of the positions and orientations\nof the vane polarizers, and each powercombining stage could be designed to incorporate an adjustable phase shifter for\nfine-tuning. There is also an analog of\nthis combining technique in waveguide.\nThis work was done by Bruce Conroy and\nDaniel Hoppe of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

In order to identify and\ntrack the objects or events without the\nmeans of dynamic adaptation to be afforded by SyFT, it would be necessary to\npost-process data from an image-data\nspace consisting of terabytes of data. Such\npost-processing would be time-consuming and, as a consequence, could result in\nmissing significant events that could not\nbe observed at all due to the time evolution of such events or could not be observed at required levels of fidelity without such real-time adaptations as\nadjusting focal-plane operating conditions or aiming of the focal plane in different directions to track such events.\nThe basic concept of foveal imaging is\nstraightforward: In imitation of a natural\neye, a foveal-vision image sensor is designed to offer higher resolution in a small\nregion of interest (ROI) within its field of\nview. Foveal vision reduces the amount of\nunwanted information that must be transferred from the image sensor to external\nimage-data-processing circuitry. The aforementioned basic concept is not new in itself: indeed, image sensors based on these\nconcepts have been described in several\n\n12\n\nImager\n(One Element of\nMosaic Focal Plane)\n\nControl\n\nPixel Data\n\nImager Control Logic\nImager Processing Logic\nReprogrammable\nController\n\nRouting Processor\n\nLocal Host Interface\n\n\xe2\x80\x9dSMART\xe2\x80\x9d IMAGER CELL\n\nSmart Imager\nCell\nSmart Imager\nCell\nSmart Imager\nCell\nSmart Imager\nCell\n\nSmart Imager\nCell\nSmart Imager\nCell\n\nSmart Imager\nCell\nSmart Imager\nCell\n\nSmart Imager\nCell\nSmart Imager\nCell\n\nSmart Imager\nCell\nSmart Imager\nCell\n\nSharing of Pixel\nData and Processed\nResults for\nFoveation\n\nInput Parameters, Output\nPixel Data, and Processed Results\nMULTIPLE \xe2\x80\x9dSMART\xe2\x80\x9d IMAGER CELLS IN A MOSAIC IMAGING SYSTEM\n\nA Mosaic Imaging System According to SyFT would be built from \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d imager cells, each of which\nwould contain a focal-plane image sensor and a reprogrammable controller.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\nprevious NASA Tech Briefs articles. Activepixel integrated-circuit image sensors that\ncan be programmed in real time to effect\nfoveal artificial vision on demand are one\nsuch example. What is new in SyFT is a\nsynergistic combination of recent advances in foveal imaging, computing, and\nrelated fields, along with a generalization\nof the basic foveal-vision concept to admit\na synthetic fovea that is not restricted to\none contiguous region of an image.\nThe figure depicts a mesh-connected\nSyFT architecture as applied to a focalplane mosaic of homogeneous or heterogeneous image sensors. The architecture\nprovides a networked array of reprogrammable controllers for autonomous\nlow-level control with on-the-fly processing of image data from individual image\nsensors. Each image sensor in the mosaic\nfocal plane is mapped to one of the controllers so that taken together the reprogrammable controllers constitute a conceptual (though not necessarily a\ngeometric) image-processing plane corresponding to the mosaic focal plane.\nThe controllers can be made versatile\nenough to control and to process pixel\ndata from both charged-coupled-device\n(CCD) and complementary metal\n\noxide/semiconductor (CMOS) image\nsensors in the mosaic focal plane. The\nimage sensors can also have multiple\npixel data outputs where each output has\ndedicated processing circuitry in its associated controller to achieve high\nthroughput with real-time processing for\nfeature detection and processing.\nEach controller includes a routing\nprocessor to implement the network protocol and define the network topology\nfor real-time transfer of raw pixel data\nand processed results between controllers. The network protocol and the\ncapability to implement it are essential to\nrealization of the capability for synthetic\nfoveal imaging across the entire mosaic\nfocal plane. The processing and networking capabilities of the controllers will enable real-time access to data from multiple image sensors, with application-level\ncontrol of one or more ROI(s) within\nthe mosaic focal plane array for sharing\nof detected data features among controllers. These capabilities will effectively\nfacilitate the equivalent of rewiring and\nreconfiguration with different sensors in\nthe mosaic, with scalability to different\nmosaic sizes dictated by application requirements. Consequently, the mosaic\n\nfocal plane is treated as an integrated ensemble of synthetic foveal regions that\ncan traverse the entire mosaic for autonomous intelligent feature detection\nand tracking capability. Unlike the current state-of-the-art in image sensors,\n\xe2\x80\x9cSyFTing\xe2\x80\x9d enables intelligent viewing\nthrough vast amounts of image data by\ntreating a mosaic focal plane of sensors\nas an integrated ensemble rather than a\ncollection of isolated sensors.\nThis work was done by Michael Hoenk,\nSteve Monacos, and Shouleh Nikzad of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1).\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title to this\ninvention.

The purpose\nserved by the system is to enable minimum-cycle-slip reception of GPS signals used in precise computation of the\ntrajectory of the airplane, without having to restrict the airplane to maneuvers that increase the flight time\nneeded to perform a survey.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCycle slip\xe2\x80\x9d signifies loss of continuous\ntrack of the phase of a signal. Minimumcycle-slip reception is desirable because\nmaintaining constant track of the phase\nof the carrier signal from each available\nGPS satellite is necessary for surveying to\ncentimeter or subcentimeter precision.\nEven a loss of signal for as short a time as\na nanosecond can cause cycle slip. Cycle\nslips degrade the quality and precision of\nsurvey data acquired during a flight.\nThe two principal causes of cycle slip\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\nRadome\n\nThe Radome Atop the Fuselage of the NOAA\nhurricane-hunting airplane houses the present\nminimum-cycle-slip GPS antenna system.\n\nare weakness of signals and multipath\npropagation. Heretofore, it has been standard practice to mount a GPS antenna\nrigidly on top of an airplane, and the radiation pattern of the antenna is typically\nhemispherical, so that all GPS satellites\nabove the horizon are viewed by the antenna during level flight. When the air-\n\nplane must be banked for a turn or other\nmaneuver, the reception hemisphere becomes correspondingly tilted; hence, the\nantenna no longer views satellites that\nmay still be above the Earth horizon but\nare now below the equatorial plane of the\ntilted reception hemisphere. Moreover,\npart of the reception hemisphere (typically, on the inside of a turn) becomes\npointed toward ground, with a consequent increase in received noise and,\ntherefore, degradation of GPS measurements.\nTo minimize the likelihood of loss of signal and cycle slip, bank angles of remotesensing survey airplanes have generally\nbeen limited to 10\xc2\xb0 or less, resulting in\nskidding or slipping uncoordinated turns.\nAn airplane must be banked in order to\nmake a coordinated turn. For small-radius,\nshort-time coordinated turns, it is necessary to employ banks as steep as 45\xc2\xb0, and\nturns involving such banks are considered\nnormal maneuvers. These steep banks are\nhighly desirable for minimizing flight\n\n13\n\ntimes and for confining airplanes as\nclosely as possible to areas to be surveyed.\nThe idea underlying the design is that\nif the antenna can be kept properly\naimed, then the incidence of cycle slips\ncaused by loss or weakness of signals can\nbe minimized. The system includes an articulating GPS antenna and associated\nelectronic circuitry mounted under a\nradome atop an airplane. The electronic\ncircuitry includes a microprocessor-based\ninterface-circuit-and-data-translation\nmodule. The system receives data on the\ncurrent attitude of the airplane from the\n\ninertial navigation system of the airplane.\nThe microprocessor decodes the attitude\ndata and uses them to compute commands for the GPS-antenna-articulating\nmechanism to tilt the antenna, relative to\nthe airplane, in opposition to the roll or\nbank of the airplane to keep the antenna\npointed toward the zenith.\nThe system was tested aboard the hurricane-hunting airplane of the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n(NOAA) [see figure] during an 11-hour\nflight to observe the landfall of Hurricane\nBret in late summer of 1999. No bank-\n\nangle restrictions were imposed during\nthe flight. Post-flight analysis of the GPS\ntrajectory data revealed that no cycle slip\nhad occurred.\nThis work was done by C. Wayne Wright of\nGoddard Space Flight Center. Further information is contained in a TSP (see page 1).\nThis invention has been patented by NASA\n(U.S. Patent No. 6,844,856 B1).

These materials are intended to enable reductions in dark currents and increases in quantum efficiencies, relative to those of comparable\nimagers made from prior silicon-on-insulator (SOI) starting materials.\nSome background information is prerequisite to a meaningful description of\nthe improved starting materials and\nprocess. A prior SOI starting material,\ndepicted in the upper part the figure, includes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A device layer on the front side, typically between 2 and 20 \xc2\xb5m thick, made\nof p-doped silicon (that is, silicon\nlightly doped with an electron acceptor, which is typically boron);\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A buried oxide (BOX) layer (that is, a\nburied layer of oxidized silicon) between 0.2 and 0.5 \xc2\xb5m thick; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A silicon handle layer (also known as\na handle wafer) on the back side, between about 600 and 650 \xc2\xb5m thick.\nAfter fabrication of the imager circuitry in and on the device layer, the\nhandle wafer is etched away, the BOX\nlayer acting as an etch stop. In subsequent operation of the imager, light\nenters from the back, through the\nBOX layer. The advantages of back illumination over front illumination have\nbeen discussed in prior NASA Tech\nBriefs articles.\nFor reasons too complex to discuss\nwithin the space available for this arti-\n\n14\n\ncle, one modification that is necessary\nfor reducing dark current and increasing quantum efficiency is the incorporation of a thin, heavily doped (e.g., p++doped with boron) silicon layer\nbetween the lightly doped device layer\nand the BOX layer. In prior research, an\nattempt to incorporate a thin, heavily\ndoped layer by implanting boron at the\nBOX/device-silicon interface before\n\nbonding the BOX layer to the handle\nwafer did not yield the desired doping\nprofile: The bonding process unavoidably included a high-temperature anneal that caused the implanted boron to\ndiffuse away from the interface, thereby\ncausing an undesired decrease in the\ndoping concentration at the interface\nand an undesired increase in the doping concentration in the device layer.\n\np-Doped Device Layer\nBuried Oxide Layer\n\nTypical Prior SOI\nStarting Material\n\nHandle Wafer\n\np-++Doped Device Layer\nThermal-Oxide Layer\nBuried Oxide Layer\nHandle Wafer\n\nTypical Improved\nSOI Starting\nMaterial\n\nFurther Preprocessing\np-Doped Epitaxial Device Layer\n\np-++Doped Device Layer\nThermal-Oxide Layer\nBuried Oxide Layer\n\nHandle Wafer\n\nNote: Layer thicknesses are not drawn to scale.\n\nAn SOI Starting Material of the present improved type differs from a typical prior SOI starting material in several respects.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\nThis concludes the background information.\nA starting material of the present improved type, depicted in the middle and\nlower parts of figure, differs from prior\nSOI starting materials in the following\nways:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The front silicon layer is heavily doped\n[e.g., p++-doped with boron], typically\nat a concentration of 1019 atoms/cm3\ninstead of being lightly doped at the\nconventional device concentration of\n1015 atoms/cm3.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There is a layer of thermal oxide between the front silicon layer and the\nBOX layer.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The starting material is further preprocessed by growing, to an appropriate thickness, a front epitaxial silicon\nlayer that is lightly doped (e.g., pdoped) typically at a concentration of\n\n7 \xc3\x97 1014 boron atoms/cm3. This front\nepitaxial layer serves as the device\nlayer in subsequent fabrication of an\nimager.\nThe advantage afforded by such an\nimproved starting material arises from\nthe fact that epitaxial silicon is grown at\na temperature much lower than that of\nthe anneal in the aforementioned BOXto-handle-wafer-bonding process. Therefore, diffusion of boron away from the\ninterface and into the device silicon is\nprevented. Optionally, one could perform an anneal at an intermediate temperature chosen to effect a small\namount of diffusion to optimize the doping profile. Furthermore, the performance of the imager circuitry can be improved because the quality of the\nepitaxial silicon in the improved starting\nmaterial is better than that of the float-\n\nzone device-layer silicon in prior SOI\nstarting materials. All of the arguments\nmade above would remain valid for cases\nin which electron-donor (n) dopants\nwere substituted for p dopants.\nThis work was done by Bedabrata Pain of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517, the\ncontractor has elected to retain title to this invention.

The\nmodulations include quadrature phaseshift keying (QPSK), offset quadrature\nphase-shift keying (OQPSK), Gaussian\nminimum-shift keying (GMSK), and octonary phase-shift keying (8PSK) with\nsquare-root raised-cosine pulse shaping.

The role of the\nmodulator board is to encode the incoming data stream and to shape the\nresulting pulses, which are fed as inputs\nto the vector modulator. The combination of encoding and pulse shaping in a\ngiven application is chosen to maximize\nthe bandwidth efficiency.\nThe modulator board includes gallium arsenide serial-to-parallel converters at its input end. A complementary\nmetal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS)\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA)\nperforms the coding and modulation\n\ncomputations and utilizes parallel processing in doing so.

The entire device rotates about the tool rotation\naxis, which is aligned parallel to the nom-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\ninal normal direction of the parent rock\nsurface. Both jaws also rotate about the\njaw axis, which is perpendicular to the\ntool rotation axis, at a rate much slower\nthan the rotation about the tool rotation\naxis. This movement gradually closes the\njaws into a nearly continuous hemispherical shell that encloses the sample as it is\n\ncut from the parent rock. When required\nthe jaws are opened to release the sample. The hemispherical cutting method\neliminates the sample retention problems associated with existing sample acquisition methods that employ conventional cylindrical cutting.\nThe resulting samples are hemispher-\n\n19\n\nical, or nearly hemispherical, and as a result the aspect ratio (sample depth relative to sample radius) is essentially fixed.\nThis fixed sample aspect ratio may be\nconsidered a drawback of the Rock\nBaller method, as samples with a higher\naspect ratio (more depth, less width)\nmay be considered more scientifically\nvaluable because such samples would\nallow for a broader inspection of the ge-\n\nological record. This aspect ratio issue\ncan be ameliorated if the Rock Baller is\npaired with a device similar to the Rock\nAbrasion Tool (RAT) used on the Mars\nExploration Rovers. The RAT could be\nused to first grind into the surface of the\nparent rock, after which the Rock Baller\nwould extract a sample from a depth inside the rock that would not have been\npossible without first using the RAT.\n\nOther potential applications for this\ntechnology include medical applications\nsuch as the removal of tissue samples or\ntumors from the body, particularly during endoscopic, laparoscopic, or thoracoscopic surgeries.\nThis work was done by Louis R.

The basic purpose of this assembly or of a typical prior\nrelated assembly is to channel the flow\nof a chemically inert gas to a joint to prevent environmental contamination of\nthe joint during the welding or brazing\nprocess and, if required, to accelerate\ncooling upon completion of the process.\nIn a typical prior welding gas-shielding\nassembly, depicted in the left part of the\nfigure, the inert gas is fed to the joint\nthrough a central nozzle in the welding\ntorch. This arrangement does not always\nprovide adequate protection against contaminants because the inert gas flows turbulently into the joint region and is not\nevenly distributed in the heated region\nsurrounding the joint. The lack of inert\ngas in some places in the region surrounding the joint can result in oxidation,\nwhich, in turn, can lead to porosity and ultimately to cracking. Improper distribution of shielding gas can also lead to the\nformation of plasma and to insufficient\ncooling of portions of the region surrounding the joint that are meant to be\nprotected against excessive heating.\nThe present improved welding gasshielding assembly, depicted in the right\npart of the figure, provides a column of\nevenly distributed gas flow directly surrounding the pool of molten metal in the\n\nConical\nInner Body\n\nFirst\nChamber\nAnnular\nOrifice\n\nHousing Body\n\nSecond\nChamber\n\nShielding\nGas Flow\n\nEnd Cap\n\nWeld Joint\n\nLaser Beam or\nWelding Electrode\n\nWorkpiece\n\nPRIOR DESIGN\n\nShielding\nGas Flow\nWeld Joint\n\nLaser Beam or\nWelding Torch\nWorkpiece\n\nIMPROVED DESIGN\n\nThese Simplified Cross Sections show the main differences between the present improved welding\ngas-shielding assembly and a typical prior such assembly.\n\nweld joint to prevent oxidation and formation of plasma.\nThe assembly includes a conical inner\nbody and an outer shell comprising a housing body and an end cap. The outer shell\ncontains chambers sized and shaped to act,\nalong with the conical inner body, to distribute the inert gas evenly around the conical inner body and to encapsulate the flow\nof the gas and direct the flow onto the desired region surrounding the weld joint.\nThe gas enters the assembly through a\nsupply tube from an external source. The\npassage through which the gas enters is\ntangential, so the gas flows in tangentially,\ncreating a vortex flow in the chambers between the outer shell and the conical\n\ninner body. The gas circulates as it fills\nthe first chamber, then flows through an\nannular orifice to fill a second chamber\nand then flows through a series of diffusing screens. After flowing through the\nscreens, the gas is directed to the weld\njoint area by means of a nozzle. The combination of the vortex flow, chambers,\nand screens provides even columnar flow\naround the entire heated area.\nThis work was done by Paul Gradl and\nKevin Baker of Marshall Space Flight Center\nand Jack Weeks of Pratt & Whitney.

This\nprocess has considerable commercial\npotential in that flip-chip hybridization\nis used in the manufacture of cellular\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\ntelephones and other compact, portable\nelectronic products.\nThe need for this or another, similar\ncleaning process arises as follows: Indium bonding bumps tend to oxidize\nduring exposure to air. As the duration\nof exposure and the level of oxidation\nincrease, the electrical resistances of the\n\nbonds subsequently formed via the\nbumps also increase. In some cases, the\nresistances can become so large that the\nbump bonds may act as open circuits,\npreventing proper functioning of the\nbump-bonded devices.\nThere is a patented process for removal of surface indium oxide layers by\n\n21\n\nBond Pads\n\nIndium Bumps\n\nIndium Bumps\n\nPROCESSED AT POWER GREATER THAN OPTIMUM\n\nPROCESSED AT OPTIMUM POWER\n\nThese Indium Bonding Bumps were treated by two different versions of the two-step plasma process. The pockmarks on the left bump were caused by\nusing greater-than-optimum plasma-generating power in the second step of the process. The right bump was processed at optimum power.\n\netching with hydrochloric acid. Unfortunately, once the oxide is removed, the\nacid can continue to attack the indium,\nreducing the size of the bumps and even\nundercutting them. The acid can also\nattack metal layers on and under the\nbond pads, potentially creating open\ncircuits and thus negating the benefit of\nremoving the oxide. In contrast, the\ntwo-step plasma process makes it possible to remove surface indium oxide,\nwithout incurring the adverse effects of\nthe acid etching process.\nIn the first step of the plasma process, a\ndevice on which indium bonding bumps\nhas been formed is exposed for a suitable\namount of time (typically, 20 minutes) to\na plasma generated in a gaseous mixture\nof 1/3 argon + 1/3 methane + 1/3 hydrogen. During this step, the oxygen in the\n\nindium oxide is removed through incorporation into CO and CO2 gas molecules,\nwhile the indium in the indium oxide is\nremoved through incorporation into\nIn(CH3), which is volatile. Following this\nstep, a carbonaceous surface film is also\nformed on device surfaces that are not\ncovered by indium.\nA second step for removing the carbonaceous film is as follows. The device\nis exposed to a plasma generated in a\ngaseous mixture comprising 72 percent\nof argon and 28 percent of hydrogen.\nThis step greatly reduces the carbon\ncontent without exerting any significant\nadverse effect on the indium. The power\nused to generate the plasma in this step\nmust be chosen carefully: the power\nshould be high enough to ensure effective removal of the carbonaceous film,\n\nbut not so high as to melt or otherwise\ndamage the indium bumps (see figure).\nThis work was done by Harold F.

The figure of\nmerit that characterizes the thermal-toelectric power-conversion efficiency is\ngreater for this material than for SiGe,\nwhich, until now, has been regarded as\nthe state-of-the art high-temperature ptype thermoelectric material. Moreover,\nrelative to SiGe, Yb14MnSb11 is better\nsuited to incorporation into a segmented\nthermoelectric leg that includes the moderate-temperature p-type thermoelectric\nmaterial CeFe4Sb12 and possibly other,\nlower-temperature p-type thermoelectric\nmaterials.\nInterest in Yb14MnSb11 as a candidate\nhigh-temperature thermoelectric material was prompted in part by its unique\nelectronic properties and complex crystalline structure, which place it in a class\nsomewhere between (1) a class of semiconducting valence compounds known\nin the art as Zintl compounds and (2) the\nclass of intermetallic compounds. From\nthe perspective of chemistry, this classification of Yb14MnSb11 provides a first indication of a potentially rich library of compounds, the thermoelectric properties of\nwhich can be easily optimized.\nThe concepts of the thermoelectric\nfigure of merit and the thermoelectric\ncompatibility factor are discussed in\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompatibility of Segments of Thermoelectric Generators\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-30798),\nwhich appears on page 55. The traditional thermoelectric figure of merit, Z,\nis defined by the equation\nZ = \xce\xb12/\xcf\x81\xce\xba\nwhere \xce\xb1 is the Seebeck coefficient, \xcf\x81 is\nthe electrical resistivity, and \xce\xba is the thermal conductivity. Sometimes, in current\nusage, the term \xe2\x80\x9cthermoelectric figure\nof merit\xe2\x80\x9d signifies the product ZT, where\nT is the absolute temperature. The thermoelectric compatibility factor, s, is defined by the equation\ns = [(1 + ZT)1/2 \xe2\x80\x93 1]/\xce\xb1T.\nFor maximum efficiency, s should not\nchange with temperature, both within a\nsingle material, and throughout a seg-\n\nCeFe4Sb12\n3.0\n\nYb14MnSb11\n2.0\n\n1.0\n0.9\n\nSiGe\n\n0.8\n0.7\n475\n\n675\n\n875\n\n1,075\n\n1,275\n\nTemperature, K\nThermoelectric Figures of Merit and Compatibility Factors of three compounds of interest as functions\nof temperature are plotted to illustrate the superiority of Yb14MnSb11 over SiGe.\n\nmented thermoelectric-generator leg as\na whole. It is in this sense that s serves as\na basis for assessing both compatibility\namong segments and compatibility\nwithin a segment (self-compatibility).\nThe degree to which s varies with tem-\n\nperature along a given segment or differs among adjacent segments in a thermoelectric leg thus serves as a measure\nof incompatibility that one strives to\nminimize.\nAs shown in the upper part of the fig-\n\n23\n\nure, in the temperature range of 975 to\n1,275 K, the ZT value of Yb14MnSb11 is approximately double that of SiGe. Moreover, as shown in the lower part of the figure, the s value of Yb14MnSb11 is much\ncloser to that of CeFe4Sb12 than is the s\nvalue of SiGe. The net effect of the\ngreater ZT and closer match of s of\nYb14MnSb11, compared to those of SiGe,\nis that the thermal-to-electric power-conversion efficiency of a segmented\nYb14MnSb11/CeFe4Sb12 leg operating between the given hot-side and cold-side\ntemperatures is significantly greater than\n\nthat of a SiGe/CeFe4Sb12 leg operating\nbetween the same hot- and cold-side temperatures. For example, for a hot-side\ntemperature of 1,275 K and a cold-side\ntemperature of 775 K, the thermal-toelectric power-conversion efficiency of a\nsegmented Yb14MnSb11/CeFe4Sb12 leg is\nabout 7.3 percent, while that of a segmented SiGe/CeFe4Sb12 leg is about\n4.5 percent.\nThis work was done by G.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nComposites of specific types of polymer foams and aerogel particles or blankets have been proposed to obtain thermal insulation performance superior to\nthose of the neat polyimide foams.\nThese composites have potential to also\nprovide enhanced properties for vibration dampening or acoustic attenuation.\nThe specific type of polymer foam is denoted \xe2\x80\x9cTEEK-H,\xe2\x80\x9d signifying a series, denoted \xe2\x80\x9cH,\xe2\x80\x9d within a family of polyimide\nfoams that were developed at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nLangley Research Center and are collectively denoted \xe2\x80\x9cTEEK\xe2\x80\x9d (an acronym of\nthe inventors\xe2\x80\x99 names).\nThe specific types of aerogels include\nNanogel\xc2\xae aerogel particles from Cabot\nCorporation in Billerica, MA. and of\nSpaceloft\xc2\xae aerogel blanket from Aspen\nAerogels in Northborough, MA. The\ncomposites are inherently flame-retardant\nand exceptionally thermally stable.\nThere are numerous potential uses\nfor these composites, at temperatures\nfrom cryogenic to high temperatures,\nin diverse applications that include\naerospace vehicles, aircraft, ocean vessels, buildings, and industrial process\nequipment. Some low-temperature applications, for example, include cryogenic storage and transfer or the trans-\n\n24\n\nport of foods, medicines, and chemicals. Because of thermal cycling, aging,\nand weathering most polymer foams do\nnot perform well at cryogenic temperatures and will undergo further cracking\nover time.\nThe TEEK polyimides are among the\nfew exceptions to this pattern, and the\nproposed composites are intended to\nhave all the desirable properties of TEEKH foams, plus improved thermal performance along with enhanced vibration\nor acoustic-attenuation performance.\nA composite panel as proposed would\nbe fabricated by adding an appropriate\namount of TEEK friable balloons into a\nmold to form a bottom layer. A piece of\nflexible aerogel blanket material, cut to\nthe desired size and shape, would then\nbe placed on the bottom TEEK layer and\nsandwiched between another top layer\nof polyimide friable balloons so that the\naerogel blanket would become completely encased in an outer layer of\nTEEK friable balloons. Optionally, the\nprocess could be further repeated to\nproduce multiple aerogel-blanket layers\ninterspersed with and encased by TEEK\nfriable balloons.\nThe sandwiching of aerogel bulk-fill\nparticles would follow the same meth-\n\nodology or could be mixed directly with\nfriable balloons up to 40% weight loading of the aerogel particles to friable\nballoons. After sandwiching or mixing\nof the polymide and aerogel components, the mold, without a top cover,\nwould be placed in a convection furnace and heated at a temperature of\n250 \xc2\xb0C for one hour. Then the top\ncover would be placed on the mold and\nthe temperature increased to about 320\n\xc2\xb0C for between 1 and 3 hours for full\nimidization of the polyimide component. The resulting composite should\nhave all the desirable properties of\nTEEK, and its effective thermal conductivity should be less than that of an approximately equally dense panel made\nof TEEK foam only. The heat transfer\nreduction is directly proportional to %\nloading of the aerogel component. The\nexcellent structural integrity of the\nfoam material is maintained in the\ncomposite formulations.\nThis work was done by Martha Williams,\nJames Fesmire, Jared Sass and Trent Smith of\nKennedy Space Center and Erik Weiser of\nLangley Research Center.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nAt NASA, hydrogen safety is a key\nconcern for space shuttle processing.\nLeaks of any level must be quickly recognized and addressed due to hydrogen\xe2\x80\x99s lower explosion limit. Chemochromic devices have been developed\nto detect hydrogen gas in several embodiments. Because hydrogen is odorless and colorless and poses an explosion hazard, there is an emerging need\nfor sensors to quickly and accurately\ndetect low levels of leaking hydrogen\nin fuel cells and other advanced energy-generating systems in which hydrogen is used as fuel.\nThe device incorporates a chemochromic pigment into a base polymer.\nThe article can reversibly or irreversibly change color upon exposure to\nhydrogen. The irreversible pigment\nchanges color from a light beige to a\ndark gray. The sensitivity of the pigment can be tailored to its application\nby altering its exposure to gas through\n\nthe incorporation of one or more additives or polymer matrix. Furthermore,\nthrough the incorporation of insulating additives, the chemochromic sensor can operate at cryogenic temperatures as low as 78 K.\nA chemochromic detector of this\ntype can be manufactured into any feasible polymer part including injection\nmolded plastic parts, fiber-spun textiles, or extruded tapes. The detectors\nare simple, inexpensive, portable, and\ndo not require an external power\nsource. The chemochromic detectors\nwere installed and removed easily at\nthe KSC launch pad without need for\nspecial expertise. These detectors may\nrequire an external monitor such as\nthe human eye, camera, or electronic\ndetector; however, they could be left in\nplace, unmonitored, and examined\nlater for color change to determine\nwhether there had been exposure\nto hydrogen.\n\nIn one type of envisioned application,\nchemochromic detectors would be fabricated as outer layers (e.g., casings or\ncoatings) on high-pressure hydrogen\nstorage tanks and other components of\nhydrogen-handling systems to provide\nvisible indications of hydrogen leaks\ncaused by fatigue failures or other failures in those systems. In another type of\nenvisioned application, chemochromic\ndetectors of this type could be optoelectronically instrumented for monitoring\nto provide measured digital indications\nof color changes indicative of the presence of hydrogen.\nThis work was done by Luke Roberson, Janine Captain, Martha Williams, Trent\nSmith, and LaNetra Tate of Kennedy Space\nCenter; and Ali Raissi, Nahid Mohajeri,\nNazim Muradov, and Gary Bokerman of\nFlorida Solar Energy Center.

Because\nit is directly traceable to first principles,\nthe method provides physical explanations in addition to predictions of phenomena involved in segmentation. In\ncomparison with the finite-element\nmethod used heretofore to predict\n(without being able to explain) the behavior of a segmented thermoelectric\ngenerator, this method is much simpler\nto implement in practice: in particular,\nthe efficiency of a segmented thermoelectric generator can be estimated by\nevaluating equations using only handheld calculator with this method. In addition, the method provides for determi-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2009\n\nnation of cascading ratios. The concept\nof cascading is illustrated in the figure\nand the definition of the \xe2\x80\x9ccascading\nratio\xe2\x80\x9d is defined in the figure caption.\nAn important aspect of the method is\nits approach to the issue of compatibility among segments, in combination\nwith introduction of the concept of\ncompatibility within a segment. Prior\napproaches involved the use of only averaged material properties. Two materials in direct contact could be examined\nfor compatibility with each other, but\nthere was no general framework for\nanalysis of compatibility. The present\nmethod establishes such a framework.\nThe mathematical derivation of the\nmethod begins with the definition of\nreduced efficiency of a thermoelectric generator as the ratio between\n(1) its thermal-to-electric power-con-\n\nversion efficiency and (2) its Carnot\nefficiency (the maximum efficiency\ntheoretically attainable, given its hotand cold-side temperatures). The\nderivation involves calculation of the\nreduced efficiency of a model thermoelectric generator for which the\nhot-side temperature is only infinitesimally greater than the cold-side temperature. The derivation includes\nconsideration of the ratio (u) between the electric current and heatconduction power and leads to the\nconcept of compatibility factor (s) for\na given thermoelectric material, defined as the value of u that maximizes\nthe reduced efficiency of the aforementioned model thermoelectric\ngenerator. It turns out that s depends\nonly on the absolute temperature (T)\nand on intrinsic properties of the ma-\n\n27\n\nto which s varies with temperature along\na given segment or differs among adjacent segments thus serves as a measure\nof incompatibility that one strives to\nminimize.\nThe compatibility factor can further\nbe used as a quantitative guide for deciding whether a thermoelectric material is better suited for segmentation\nor cascading. Cascading enables the\nuse of a material that may be suitable\nfor a given temperature stage but is incompatible for segmentation with one\nor more other materials in the same\ntemperature stage. The simplest option that may be available in a given\ncase is to choose the numbers of unicouples in both temperature stages\nsuch that each stage is operating at its\noptimal u value. Such a choice is em-\n\nTH\n\nn\n\np\n\np\nQ\n\nn\n\nn\n\np\n\nn\n\np\n\nTC\nI\n\nRL\n\nSEGMENTED GENERATOR\n\nI\n\nRL\n\nCASCADED GENERATOR\n\nThis Schematic Diagram compares segmented with cascaded thermoelectric generator. The cascading\nratio is defined as the ratio between the numbers of unicouples in the two stages.\n\nterial that may vary with the temperature. The equation for s is\n\ns\xe2\x89\xa1\n\n1 + ZT \xe2\x88\x92 1\n\xce\xb1T\n\nwhere Z is the traditional thermoelectric\nfigure of merit, defined as Z = \xce\xb12/\xcf\x81\xce\xba; \xce\xb1 is\nthe Seebeck coefficient; \xcf\x81 is the electrical\nresistivity; and \xce\xba is the thermal conductivity.\n\nFor maximum efficiency, u should be\nequal to s, both within a single material,\nand throughout a segmented thermoelectric-generator leg as a whole. It is in\nthis sense that s serves as a basis for assessing both compatibility among segments and compatibility within a segment (self-compatibility). Given that u\nremains relatively constant throughout\nthe thermoelectric element, the degree\n\ng\xe2\x80\xb2 u\xe2\x80\xb2\n=\ng u\nbodied in the following expression for\nthe cascading ratio:\nwhere g is the number of unicouples per\nstage and the prime mark distinguishes\none stage from the other.\nThis work was done by G.

The concept\ncan also be applied to bulk semiconductor-based infrared detectors. CBIRD uses\ntwo different types of specially designed\nbarriers: an electron barrier that blocks\nelectrons but not holes, and a hole barrier\nthat blocks holes but not electrons. The\nCBIRD structure consists of an n-contact, a\nhole barrier, an absorber, an electron barrier, and a p-contact.\nThe barriers are placed at the contactabsorber junctions where, in a conventional p-i-n detector structure, there normally are depletion regions that\nproduce generation-recombination (GR) dark currents due to Shockley-ReadHall (SRH) processes.

The barriers also\nblock diffusion dark currents generated\nin the diffusion wings in the neutral regions. In addition, the wider gap barriers serve to reduce tunneling dark currents. In the case of a superlattice-based\nabsorber, the superlattice itself can be\ndesigned to suppress dark currents due\nto Auger processes. At the same time,\nthe barriers actually help to enhance the\ncollection of photo-generated carriers\nby deflecting the photo-carriers that are\ndiffusing in the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d direction (i.e.,\naway from collectors) and redirecting\nthem toward the collecting contacts.\nThe contact layers are made from materials with narrower bandgaps than the\nbarriers. This allows good ohmic contacts to be made, resulting in lower contact resistances.\nPreviously, THALES Research and\nTechnology (France) demonstrated de-\n\ntectors with bulk InAsSb (specifically\nabsorber\nlatticeInAs0.91Sb0.09)\nmatched to GaSb substrates. The absorber is surrounded by two wider\nbandgap layers designed to minimize\nimpedance to photocurrent flow. The\nwide bandgap materials also serve as\ncontacts. The cutoff wavelength of the\nInAsSb absorber is fixed. CBIRD may\nbe considered as a modified version of\nthe THALES double heterostructure\n(DH) p-i-n device, but with even wider\nbandgap barriers inserted at the contact layer/absorber layer interfaces. It is\ndesigned to work with either bulk semiconductors or superlattices as the absorber material. The superlattice\nbandgap can be adjusted to match the\ndesired absorption cutoff wavelength.\nThis infrared detector has the potential of high-sensitivity operation\nat higher operating temperatures.\nThis would reduce cooling require-\n\nments, thereby reducing the power,\nmass, and volume of the equipment\nand allowing an increased mission\nscience return.\nThis work was done by David Z.
