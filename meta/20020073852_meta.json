Women, like men, must choose during their teenage years to continue their training in math or science, or they close the door that can lead them to futures in the interesting and satisfying fields of science and engineering. The key is to keep girls involved in the hard sciences through the adolescent crisis. Many mentoring and outreach programs exist to help young women cross this threshold. These programs include hands-on science experiences, mentoring or putting young women in contact with women scientists and engineers, and internships, Viewpoints and histories of contemporary women engineers are discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020073852, "endDate": "1999-05-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Women in Science Conference", "location": "Chicago, IL", "id": "98152773bb0b4636b5c4efdddc761334", "startDate": "1999-05-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020073852, "id": "af4992c48fe447d1b373daa94753641e", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
