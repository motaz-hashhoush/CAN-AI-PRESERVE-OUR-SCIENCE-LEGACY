Attention is also given to possible social impacts of large-scale implementation, and the need for close consultation between management and labor is stressed. It is reported that, while the hourly cost of robot labor remained at between $4.00 and $4.60 over the period 1960-present, human hourly labor costs (including fringe benefits) have risen from less than $4.00 to nearly $17.00. Among the types of devices described are: (1) remotely controlled manipulator vehicles; (2) undersea robotic craft; (3) servo-controlled robots; and (4) articulated robots. Also covered are robot programming languages derived from such standard languages as ALGOL, FORTRAN, and BASIC.", "title": "Robots in modern industry", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T05:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810061937, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Heer, E."}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Office of Technology and Space Program Development, Pasadena", "location": "CA, United States"}}, "id": "8a75d44eb6814baab9371b3bdb4921bd"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19810061937, "publications": [{"volume": "19", "submissionId": 19810061937, "id": "a8980ac86bbe4fcb815840886b5303e9", "publicationName": "Astronautics and Aeronautics", "publicationDate": "1981-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
