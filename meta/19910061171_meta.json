Primary attention for the design criteria is given to user defined factors such as reliability, low volume, and ease of propulsion system development. Total thrust and specific impulse are held constant in the study while other parameters are explored to minimize the design chamber pressure. A brief history of the plug nozzle concept is included to point out the advanced level of technology of the concept and the feasibility of exploiting the variables considered in the study. The plug cluster concept looks very promising as a candidate for consideration for the ultimate customer driven propulsion system.", "title": "Plug nozzles - The ultimate customer driven propulsion system", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T21:20:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910061171, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Aukerman, Carl A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland; Sverdrup Technology, Inc., Brook Park, OH, United States"}}, "id": "3ee273c391144f67ac189ba1a3c769c7"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910061171, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910061171, "id": "7f74f593a3d746ef80fb7c3781e1c5fd", "publicationDate": "1991-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
