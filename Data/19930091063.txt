DOESEY.\n\nA limited mimeographed edition of the following notes was issued August 10, 1918, as\nLuminous Material Circulm No. RI&6 of the National Bureau of Standards. The cumbrous\ntitle of that circukir-\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Notes\nand Recommendations regarding Specifications for the IUuminating of ArticIee by Means of SeIf-Luminous Materials Containing Radioactive Excitanta\xe2\x80\x9d indicates its purpose and scope.\nThe circular was prepared with special reference to the ilhuniuation of military and of\nnmd instruments. In its preparation the numerous quwtions propounded to the Bureau\nduring the preceding 12 months in regard to such illumination were kept constantly in mind,\nthe greater portion of ita contents bearing directly upon these questions.\n1. Basis of qxx%feati&ns.-As the object of ilhnninating articles with self-luminous materials\nis to secure a suftlcient brightn~ combined with a satisfactory life, it is most desirable that the\nspecifications be baaed upon the brightness at deIivery and upon the rate of decrease in the\nbrightness rathar than upon such a subskliary consideration as the amount of radioactive\nmattiaJ contained in the preparation. T& becom~ at once evident when it is recognized\nthat the brightness of a given specimen of self-luminous material depends not only upon the\namount of the radioactive constituent, but also upon the age of the material and Upori the\npropertiw of ita phosphorescent responsive base. It is emphasized by the fact that the brightness of the applied material variw greatly with the method of application.\nCame of lumi7wseence.-Self4uminous radioactive materials\n2. iYe~hnin.4u8 material-(a)\nconsist of mixturm of a reeponeive base, usually zinc sulphide, with smfl amounts of radioactive substances. Lmnimxmce\nis caused and maintained by the bombardment of the\nresponsive base by the alpha radiations accompanying the disintegration of the radioactive\nconstituents of the material. Other things being the same, the br&htness of the m@erial\nincreas= as the intensity of the alpha radiation imreases. The actual brightness depends upon\nthe responsiveness of the base as weIl as upon the intensity of the bombardment.\n(b) 8ecd.ar changesin alpha ~adiution.-!l%e decrease in alpha radiation due to radioactive\ndisintegration in six months is 0.02 per cent for radium, 2 per cent for radium-D, 6 per cent for\nmesothorium-1, 16 per cent for radio\xe2\x80\x9dthorium, and 60 per cent for polonium. Th= values\naesume practicaI equilibrium between the elements named and their complete series of radioactive derivative.\nThis assumption is fulfilled for polotiurn (it has no such derivatives),\nfor radiothorium, for radium after a month if the preparation has the equilibrium amount of\nrdium-D and of polonium, for radium-D from which no polonium hss been removed for at\nkast four ye-,\nand for mesothcrium from which no radiothorium has been removed for at least\n15 or 20 years.\nIf radiothorium has been removed from the mesotihorium within the preceding 15 or 20\nyeus, the secuk decrease in the alpha radiation WU be 1- than 6 per cent. To be exact,\nafter a complete remov$d of radiothorium the alpha radiation of a mesdhorium preparation\nis zero; it at once begins to increase, and continues to grow for between four and five yeme; it\na89\n.\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\n---- -\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n\n_ _.,\n, .\xe2\x80\x94\n\n.-\n\n..\n\xe2\x80\x94-\n\n340\n\nANNUAL\n\nREPOBT\n\nNATIONAL\n\nADVISORY\n\nCOMMITTEE\n\nFOR\n\nAERONAUTICS.\n\nthen decreasea at a rate that is at first very S1OVV, fhlly after 15 or 20 years becomes pracand\ntically 6 percent in six months. From the third year to them iddle of the fdth year the intensi~\nincreases by a total of 7,4 per cent and by the seventh year it has fallen about 2 per cent\nbelow what it was at the third year.\nAfter a compIete removal of polonium, the alpha radiation of a radium-D preparation is\nzero; it at once begins to increase, and continues to grow for a period of about two yews. It\nthen decreases at a rate that is at first slow, and finally, after the fourth year (counted from\nthe time the polonium was removed), becomes practically 2 per cent i.msii months. From the\neighteenth to the twenty-fourth month the intensity increases by a total of 2 per cent and\nby the thirty-sixth month it has fallen to approximately what it was at the beginning of the\nnineteenth month.\nIn the preparation of material containing radium there is a considerable escape of radium\nemanation,i there is also a loss of radium emanation during the application of the matmial\nto the article being illuminated. This reduces the intensity of the alpha radiation. As the\nradium emanation again accumulates the intensity increasea; the recovery is half completed\nin 3.85 days and is practically complete by the end of a month.\nIf the radium. salt when incorporated with the material contained no radium-D or\npolonium its alpha radiation at the end of a month will be about 20 per cent less intense than\nif it had contained the equilibrium amounts of these substances, and will slowly increase for\nover a hundred years. The rate of growth, beghming at a very small value, increasm rapidly\nfor the first few months, then more slowly until at the end of two years the rate of growth will\nbe about 0.4 per cent in six months, and will then gradually decrease h-zero in about 115 years,\nat which time the total alpha radiation will be about 16 per cent greater than it was at the end\nof the first month.\nIf material containing radium, meaothorium, or radiothorium is not hermetically sealed,\nany increase in temperature will cause some of the air contained in it b escape, carrying with\nit a portion of the radium, or thorium, emanation. This WN reduce the intensity of the alpha\nradiation; on keeping the temperature consttmt- there will be a recovery. For radium tlm\nthe recovery will proceed as just described, being half completed in 3.85 days. For the thorium\nproducts the recovery is very rapid, being on-half completed in less than a minute. Not only\nis the recovery of the alpha radiation of the thorium products very rapid, but, on account of\nthe extremely short life of thorium emanation, the initial reduction is less than for the radium\nproducte, most of the thorium emanation disintegrating before it can escape from the material.\nA reduction of pressure produces an effect of the same kind m an devation of temperature.\nExclusive of such subsidiary @ecte as those of temperature and pressure, the secular\nvariation in the intensity of the alpha radiation of self-luminous matmials may be briefly\ndescribed as follows: If the radioactive constituent is mdhnn with ite equilibriti amounts\nof radium-D and polonium, the intansity will increase for a month, rapidly at first then more\nslowly; after a little over a month the intensity wiIl decrease very slowly, about 0.02 per cent\nin six months, If initially there was no radium-D nor polonium, the intensity wiU continue\nto increase after the first month; the rata of increase slowly decreasing, but for many ymrs\nbeing about 0,4 per cent in six months. If the radioactive constituaut is radium-D, the intansitpill oontinua.llyincrease until about two years have elapsed since the removal of polonium,\nthen the intensity will decrease, the rata of decrease never exceeding about 2 per cmt in six\nmonths and attaining this value only after four years have elapsed since the separation of the\npolonium. If the radioactive constituent iE me.sothorium-1, the intensity will continually\nincrease until about 4.5 years have elapsed since the removal of the radiothorium, then the\nintensity will decrease, the rate of decrease never exceeding 6 per cent in six months and attaining this value only after 15 or 20 years have eIapeed since the separation of the radio thorium.\nIf the radioactive constituent is either mdiothorium or polonium, the inhmsity till continually decrease, the rata being 16 and 60 per cent, respectively, in six months. AU these\nvalues assume that the radioactive materials mentioned are not accompanied by their radioactive predecessors.\n1R8dlnm\n13manation,\ndsoMMnWm,a radhctiw\nin\ntiom\n\nWhklh\n\nm\n\nWllittd\n\nduring\n\nIEdkdiVO\n\ndkillt+@hI1.\n\nKMformal by the dMntn@fon\n\nof mdfum.\n\nIt ahcudd not be mfustd\n\nwith tha radk\n\n.\n\nSEL&LUiWIXOUS\n\nMATERuw.\n\n,\n\n841\n\n(c)Secdar change8 in wpm\xe2\x80\x9dve\nhe. \xe2\x80\x94under the action of light, air, humidity, aIpha\nray bombardment, etc., changes take place in the responsive bsse. These changes are acoomptmied by a change, usually a decrease, in responsiveness. The most striking of these ohanges\nis that due to the alpha bombardment. under continued alpha radiation the responsiveness\ndeoreases, very rapidly at fist, then more and more slowly as the responsiveness becomes less.\nOther things being the same, the more intanse the radiation the more rapid the decrease in the\nresponsiveness. Whether the responsiveness will ultimately become zero is an open question.\nThe nature and extent of the changes just described are functions of the responsive base and\nvary with the latter; the base generaIIy employed is zinc sulphidej and it is this that we have\nin mind throughout these notes.\n(d) flecular cikngea in hig?ttne88. \xe2\x80\x94The secular variation in the brightmss of seMnninous\nmatarials is due i% the two causes just considered, viz, (1) the variation in the intensity of the\nalpha radiation, and (2) the secularchanges in the responsive base. For praoticel purposes\nthe resultant effect may be regarded as the sum of the changes due to these two causes.\nIf the matbd contains radium, the initial increase in the intensity of the alpha radiation\nmore than offsets the effect of the decrease in the responsiveness. As a result, the brightness\nincreases rapidly for about three weeks, then deoreases for about two weeks at a rate much\ngreater than @at which later prevails.\nIf the radioactive constituent is one of the other substances mentioned, the brightness\nshows no initial growth,l but decreases continually from the start; first rapidIy, then more\nslowIy.\nIn general we may say that the brightness of a self-luminous material undergoes marked\nohsnges during the first four or five weeks after the radioactive constituent is incorporakd\nin it. Mar this period, the brightness decresses at a more moderate rate. Of material cataining the ssme responsive base h brighter the mattitd the more quickly does ita brightn~\ndrop to 50 per cent of ita former value. For this reason it is dmirable h design the illuminated\nportions in such a manner that a material of low brightness can be used.\nNo exact Qure can be given for the rat-e at which the brightnew of applied material may\nbe expected to decrease. Wide variations in the rate are found even among dials illuminated\nat the seine time and with the same material. No explanation of this variability can now be\ngiven.\nDials of 5 microlamberk ihminated with radium material have been observed to deorease\nto 2.5 in six months; others have decressed to only 3 or 4. Similarly diaIs of 8 may decresse\nt.030rto 6intJmsame time, and those of2tol.3ort.ol.9.\nDry material containing radium and sealed in glass tubes may be expected to decrease\napproximately as shown in the following table:\nTuu\n\nL-Decraee\n\nin ihightne.w\n\nof dry materigl\n\nin 180 @n.\n\n(e) Brigiitness reduced by adhesive.-The brightness of material that has been mixed with\nan adhesive and painted upon an object is usually only 25 per cent, occasionally 40 per cent,\nof that of the dry material. We have already seen that dry material decreases in brightness\nat a lower rate than does painted material of the same brightness. It is, therefore, desirabla\nthat dry material be used wherever possible.\n.\xe2\x80\x94By the brightness of a surface is meant the luminous intensity per\n3.

It is evident that the brightness as thus defined\nis independent of the area of the luminous surface.\nAs in measuring a length we choose for our unit a length that is exactly defied (foot,\nmeter, etc.), so in measuring a brightness we choose as our unit the brightness of an exactly\ndefied bright surface.\nFor the measurement of the brightness of selHuminoua materials a suitable unit is the\nbrightness of a perfectly dif?using md completely reffect~g surfaco when illuminated by a\nsource of unit candlepower placed at a distance of 10 meters.

Total ligliL-It necessary to distinguish between the brightness of a huninous surface\nand the totrd amount of light the eye receives from it. The former is determined by the luminous\nmaterial, while the latter depends also upon the argg -of theluminous surface. When the huninous area is small as compared witJ.@ distance from the eye it is the total light that givee the\nimpression of brilliance md determines the ease with whicldlw hunimme area can be men,\nPosition mark8.\xe2\x80\x94 Marks that have to be soon, but of which\n5. Brighhass ofmarEng8.-(a)\nthe shapes do not have to be distinguished, require only a low brightness if they are to be viewed\nagainst an extended black background. Lines 1 millimeter wide and 4 millimeters long upon a\nblack metal surface in moonlight are not readily man in all positions at a distance of 75 centimeters (3o inches) if they are no brighter than 2 microlamberts. If the surface and the\nobeerver\xe2\x80\x99e eyes are shaded from the moon then such lines are soon without difllculty,\n(b) Legible character.\xe2\x80\x94U the luminous markings (numeraIsj letters, etc.) are of euch a\ncharacter that their.shapes have to b.e distinguished, the brightmss must be greater than that\nrequired for the mere seeing of position marks. Complex characters require a higher brightness\nhigh with line width of 1 miUithan simpler ones of the smne sire. Numerals 8 -eters\nmeter can be readily read Uhe moonlight at a distance of 75 centimeters (30 inches) if they\nhave a brightmss of 6 microkunberts.\n(c) Relution of brighhe88 to & .\xe2\x80\x94There are at least four distinct phenomena that limit\nthe distance at which a hnninous character can be tid:\nFirst. The resolving power of the eye. Unless the angle the character subtends at the\neye exceeds a certain value, the shape can not bo recognized, however bright the character may\nbe. This limiting angb variesgreatly from eye to eye.\nSecond. The sensitivity of the eye. This also varies over a wide range and depends upon\nboth the past and the present history of the eye. h eye that has recently beem exposed b\nlight is far 1SSS\nsensitive than if it had been kept in total darlmess for some time; aIso, if the eye\nis illuminated by an extraneous source of light ita sensitivity is diilerent from what it is when\nthe eye is illuminated by the luminous character alone.\nThird. Contrast. It is evident that the character can not be distinguished if there is no\ncontrast between it and the region bounding it. The percentage contrast in brightness that\ncan be just distinguished increases as the bri@mse is reduced. For the range of brightnoas\ncovered by articles illuminated by self-huninous matarials this limiting contrast varies approximately from 6 to 20 per cent. That is, very faint markings will not be seen unless they are at\nleast 20 per cent brighter than the surrounding surface. Ih most practical cases the lines am\nilluminated by the same light as the surface on which they are painted; their effective brightness\nis therefore enhanced. This, however, may not offset the ill effect of the light from the main\nsurface of the article. For example, a white dial illuminated directly by the full moon might\nhave a brightness of 20 microlsmberts. If the marks upon it had a brightness of 1 microlambert and a coefficient of reflection as great as that of the dial their effective brightness would\nbe but 21 microlamberts. This is but 6 per cent greater thui the Imightnws of the main surface of the dial, and the marks would be ahuost if notantirely indistinguishable.\n\nSEW-LUMINOUS\n\nMATEIUM.\n\n343\n\nFourth. A fourth limit is set by the total amount of light mtering the eye from the character. &wning that the conditions are such that this fourth %it is the only one operative,\nthen for-the same surface brightmsa a given character can be distinguished twice as far if all\nits dimensions are doubled; if its size is kept the same its brightmas must be multiplied by 4\nif it is to be distinguished at twice its former dietame. Exprmsed otherwise, this fourth limit\nstates that the distance at which a given character can be distinguished is proportional to its\nlinear dimensions multiplied by the square root of its brightrmss. As he determining factors\nare the brightness and the angle which the object subtends at the eye, the effect of increased\nsize can be secured by the use of a magnifyng lens.\nOne result of this fourth Umitiug condition is that neighboring luminous marks may appear\nto blur together although they are much farther apart than is necessmy to enable one to see\nthem as distinct under usual conditions of illumination. For ready seeing at low brightness\nluminous characters should be not only large, but open. There should be a~few smalI inclosed\nmdhuninated areas as possible; for example, unlem the 3, the top of the 6, and the bottum of\nthe 9 are welI opened, there is danger of mistaking these numerals for 8\xe2\x80\x99s.\n(d) Gwidm to required high.tnem.-The brightness needed in any particular case shouId be\ndetermined by actual experiment. Objects of the required form should be illuminated to various\nbrightnesses and examined qnder conditions of illumination that areas nearly as may be identical with those met with in servb.\nFrequedy a stencil illuminated from the rear serves\nadmirably. When the object is illuminated with luminous material it is de&able that it be\nmade too bright and then dimmed down by the use of absorbing screens.\nIn such tests at least two values should be determined: (1) The lowest usable brightness;\n(z) The brightums that is considered the most desirab~e. If there is a maximum brightness\nthat must not be exceeded this should be determined also.\nThe various dues of the brightmesadetamnined by these tests should be measured in terms\nof an established unit, preferably the miorolambert.\nThe following conclusions, drawn from observations made by various observers under a sky\nlighted by a full moon, may serve as a rough guide to the order of brightm.ss that probably\nwill be required. These conclusions apply to huninous lines on a black surface. They are but\nrough approximations, d&rent. observers and diflerent conditions of general illumination\nleading to diilerent comiluaions.\nDivision marks of one microlambert are too faint W&S the lines are very broad, those\nof 1.5 microhunbsrta am usable, but 2 microhwnberta or over is to be preferred. If the lines\nare 4 millimeters 10WW\nand 1 millimeter wide, and have a brighk\nof only 2 microlamberta\nthere are some positions in which they can not be readily seen at 75 catimetin moonlight.\nNumeraIs 7 milhmeters high with a line width of 0.6 millimeter and a bnghtiess of 2\nmicrolamberts can be read at a distawe of 30 centimeters (1 foot), but a brightness of 4 is\nmuch better. Numerals 8 milhneters high with lines 1 millimeter wide are readily read at\n75 centimeters (2+ feet) if they have a brightness of 5.\nA circular strip 6.4 millimeters (~ inch) wide with outside diameter of 38 millimeters (1}\ninches) is tilble at 9 meters (3o feet) if it has a brightiws of 6 microlamberts.\n6. i%rnmuy.-lh\ndes&uing an article to be ilhnninahd, and in drawing spec.Mcations\nfor the illumination of it, the following poiRts should be considered:\n(a) The characters should be large sad of simple design; usually they should be as large\nas is consistent with the other I\xe2\x80\x99eqnirermmti. Published reaulta indicate that when the ratio\nof height of character to width of line is equel to 8 the best condition for legibility of such\nletters ss N, S, E, and W has been secured.\n(b) The spacing should be open. It is unddrable to reduce the dwtance between adjacent\nhuninous areas t6 1sss than 2 millimeters.\n(c) The number of luminous markings should be reduced to a minimum.\n(d) Pointers can advantageously be huninous from pivot to tip, but the tail should never\nbe illuminated. In many cases it is unnecessary for the luminous material to cover the entire\nwidth~of the pointer.\n\n.- --\n\n&NNI%U.i\nREPORT\n\n944\n\nNATIONAL\n\nADVISORY\n\n00 WJXI?IWE\n\nFOR\n\nAERONAUTIC%\n\n(e) .Unilluminated areas.that can be seen by the observer should be dull black.\n(f) The brightness required should be determhed h. each case by an actual trial under\nservice. conditions of illumination and distance.\n(g) The nature of the radioacti~e constituent of. the material will be de-.ed\nby the\nlife requirements. If the life is to exceed six months, polonium unaccompanied by an equilibrium amount of radium-D should not .be used; and only under special conditions would\nradiothorium be sitidactory; there would be but little choice between mesothorium-1 and\nradium. If a short life of high brightness is desired, radiothoriurn, radium-D, and, in certain\ncases, polonium, might give satisfaction; the life of very bright materiaI is in any case short\non account of the rapid loss in the responsiveness crfthe base.\n(h) The secular decrease in the brightness of the material is very perceptible and must\nbe allowed for.\n(i) The specifications should be so worded as t.o\xe2\x80\x94\nPrevent the use of undesirable radioactive. .ccmstituent.a.

The intensity of the radiation from a short-lived\nmaterial is much greater than that from. an equsJ weight of a long-lived one. Illustrations\nof this difference are given in the following table.\nTABLE2.-Conapm+on oj the rah of ernieeian of alpha portkks.\n[-w-&aim\n\nradic-elemento u compsrerf with thair rati of emhatonfrom redium with M derivatives to and Inchdxq mdlum-c.]\nRadio+.lement.\n\nltwdl~mm.otiofi.l.\ntitidwIWm\nltruemiutgramrad io-thorium\ntithtitilvw\ni trw millkpam poloninm (mdiun-lr) .......\n\nRfuffuro.\n\nmwqramk\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.......................................................................................\n\n-1,030\n-I,lul\n\nI\n\n.\n\nOn account of this fact it-is most necessary to exercise extreme. care in the wording of\nthose portions of specifications and other discussions of luninoua materkds that deal with\nthe relative amounts of different radio-ekunenk contained in the material.\nFor example, the statement that \xe2\x80\x9c 75 per cent of the radioactive constituents shall be\nradium\xe2\x80\x9d is most ambiguous.
