The three support systems discussed are the communication interface system (CIS), the data computation complex (DCC), and the display and control system (DCS), all of which may interfere with, and share processing facilities with other applications processing supporting current MCC programs. The MCC shall provide centralized control of the space shuttle OFT from launch through orbital flight, entry, and landing until the Orbiter comes to a stop on the runway. This control shall include the functions of vehicle management in the area of hardware configuration (verification), flight planning, communication and instrumentation configuration management, trajectory, software and consumables, payloads management, flight safety, and verification of test conditions/environment.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760015149, "id": "6caed27267ed4ea48a08a2eb076ca7fb", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760015149.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760015149/downloads/19760015149.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760015149/downloads/19760015149.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760015149/downloads/19760015149.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
