Only by continuous EEG\nelect roencephalographic) monitoring can such information be obtained,\n.nd the technical problems associated with acquisition and analysis in space\n^re significant. Before the advent of manned spaceflight, there was some\nconcern about the possible adverse effects of this weightless environment\nupon sleep characteristics (Berry, 1970). During the Gemini program,\nhowever, it became apparent that fairly long duration spaceflight was not\nassociated with drastic alterations of sleeping behavior. Astronauts could\nsleep in space and, on at least some occasions, did so fairly well. In the\nGemini and Apollo programs, though, it became clear that in many instances\ninsomnia was a problem. Sleep loss, while not absolute, was sufficient in\nsome instances to result in performance decrements. In some instances,\nsleeping difficulties resulted in the use of hypnotic drugs to promote sleep\nand amphetamine-type medication to increase alertness following sleep loss.\nIt has long been recognized that sleep deprivation is associated with\ndegradation of performance, the amount or severity of the performance\ndecrement generally increasing in proportion to the length of the sleep\nloss (Naitoh, 1969)\xe2\x80\xa2 Since crew members areexpected to perform at a\nhigh level throughout a mission, their ability to obtain sufficient sleep becomes an important variable in terms of overall mission planning and\n_\nscheduling of daily work-rest periods.\nThe United States\' first attempt to record the electroencephalogram\nduring spaceflight was carried out durL^g the Gemini VII mission in 1965\n(Maulsby, 1966; Maulsby and Kellaway, 1966; Adey et al., 1967; Burch\net al. 1971). Technical difficulties associated with electrode attachment\nlimited recording to slightly under 55 hours. During that time, two sleep\nperiods were observed, and while the first was found to be inadequate in\nterms of duration and quality, the second was considered to be normal.\nPostflight examination of the recorded EEG disclosed no pathological\nchanges nor definite alterations which could be attributed to the weightless\nstate. The limited duration of this recording did not permit an adequate\nanalysis of sleep characteristics during long-term spaceflight, and consequently, the purpose of the sleep monitoring experiment developed for\nSkylab was to obtain the first truly objective evaluation of man\'s ability\nto sleep during extended space travel. An historical overview of the development of the experiment is illustrated in Fig. 1 in which specific contract,\nsupport to this laboratory is acknowledged.\nEach three-man crew carried out a wide variety of work during the\nthree Skylab missions, accomplishing a number of research projects\n2\n\ncovering the physical and biomedical sciences. The working volume of the\nSkylab orbiting laboratory was over 12 000 ft 3 , and consequently it was\ncomparable to a moderate-sized house. There was adequate space to provide\nseparate facilities for work, recreation, meals, and sleep, and the crews\nfollowed a 24-hour schedule based upon Central Standard Time, to which\nthey were accustomed on the ground. At an altitude of approximately 270\nstatute miles, Skylab circled the Earth approximately every 93 minutes.\nEach astronaut had his own sleeping compartment, which was equipped\nwith a sleep-restraint system quite similar in appearance and function to a\nsleeping bag. An eight-hour rest period was typically scheduled between\n10 p. m. and 6 a. m. for all three crew members, although variations in this\nprotocol were occasionally necessitated by specific work requirements.\nSleep was studied in an objective manner on three of the Skylab astronauts, one each during the 28-, 59-, and 84-day missions.\n\nMETHODS\nA complete system for analyzing sleep during spaceflight was designed\nfor this \'experiment and included data-acquisition hardware, onboard-analysis\ncomponents, and a capability for real-time telemetry.\nAutomatic analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), electro-oculogram\n(EOG), and head-motion signals was accomplished by onboard equipment. The\nsystem\'s output, consisting of sleep-stage information, was telemetered in\nnear \'real time to Mission Control, where a profile of sleep stage versus time\nwas accumulated. The analog signals (EEG, EOG, and head motion) were also\npreserved by onboard magnetic-tape recorders, thus allowing a more detailed\npostflight analys is.\nThe flight-hardware components are shown in Fig. 2. When sleep\nmonitoring was desired, the astronaut wore a recording cap that contained\nelectrodes for detecting EEG and EOG. Signal amplification was accomplished\nby a preamplification unit which attached to the cap near the vertex of the head.\nA dual-axis accelerometer, included within the preamplifier housing, provided\ninformation concerning movement of the subject\'s head. A control-panel\nassembly was mounted in the subject\'s sleep compartment and attached to the\npreamplifier by means of a flexible cable. Within the control-panel assembly,\nadditional circuitry accomplished automatic electrode testing, sleep analysis,\nand generation of the telemetry output signal indicative of the subject\'s current\nlevel of consciousness. _ Analog recording was accomplished by two tape recorders attached to the rear portion of the control-panel assembly.\nV\n\n3\nY\n\na\n\nData Acquisition\n\nRecording Cap\nIn developing the sleep monitoring system, we directed considerable\neffort toward the problems associated with data acquisition. Biomedical\nelectrodes have always presented problems in spaceflight because they require excessive time for proper application, are often uncomfortable, and\nare prone to dislodgment during the subject\'s activity. Several years ago,\nKado and Adey (1968) and Hanley et al. (1971) considered the particular\nproblems posed by long-term EEG monitoring, resulting in the development\nof a sponge-type electrode mounted in an elastic cap. This general concept\nwas extended in evolving the Skylab system, and a new, disposable recording\ncap was developed (Frost et al. , 1970; Frost, 1971, 1972, 1973) which contained miniaturized, flexible, sponge electrodes prefilled with an electrolyte solution to minimize preparation time.\n\ni$\n\nis\n\nThe recording cap is illustrated in Fig. 3; the picture was taken during\nthe 59-day mission (Skylab 3). The electrodes, attached inside the elastic\ncap, were joined by wires to a miniature connector at the vertex, which\npermitted rapid linkage with the preamplifier assembly. The cap contained\nseven electrodes; four electrodes (left and right central positions, C l and\nC 2 , and left and right occipital positions, 0 1 and 0 2) provided a composite\nEEG channel (Cl and C2 paired and referenced to 0 1 and 0 2 paired); two\n(one lateral to and one above the left eye) provided one EOG channel; and\none served as a ground. Following the sleep period, the preamplifier was\ndisconnected, and the used cap was discarded; i. e., a new cap was used for\neach recording session.\n\n4\n\nRecording Electrode\nThe base was flexible silicone rubber, with a silver-silver chloride\nincorporated in one surface (see Fig. 4A). A conical, silicone-rubber\nsponge was attached to the base so that it made contact with the surface of the\n\ndisc\n\ndisc.\n\nThe sponge apex terminated in a cylindrical protrusion (the filling and\nsealing tab), and the entire electrode was covered with a thin, flexible., nonporous coating (Fig. 4B). This coating consisted of three layers of vinyl\nplastic and an extremely thin outer layer of Parylene C polymer material\n(Union Carbide). During the manufacturing process, an electrically conductive gel was injected through the electrode\'s tab into the body of the sponge\nuntil the porous structure became saturated. The _injection needle was then\nwithdrawn and the tip resealed. The completed electrode was then attached\nto the cap, which could be stored indefinitely in a laminated metalized plastic\nbag,\n`\t\n\n4\n\n\t\t\n\n1\n\nTo prepare for a recording period, the subject simply removed the\ncap from its protective bag, attached the preamplifier unit, and, using a\nscissors, snipped the sealing tabs from the seven electrodes. The cap was\nthen donned, and the exposed portions of the electrodes (see Fig. 4C) made\ncontact with the scalp. The cap was held in place during a sleep period by\na padded chin strap attached with velcro fasteners.\n\nr\t\n\nPreamplifier Assembly\nMatched pairs of field-effect transistors provided a gain of approximately 10 and preamplified EEG and EOG signals within this unit. A dualaxis accelerometer and its associated preamplifier also were included for\ndetecting head motion in the lateral (side -to -side) and vertical (up-down)\naxes. The amplified signals passed through a four-ft cable (see Fig. 2)\nto the control-panel assembly, which provided final amplification.\n\n\xc2\xb0- -\t\n\nCircuitry within the preamplifier also provided electroshock protection for the subject and electrostatic protection for the system\'s electronic\ncomponents - Each electrode lead was actively protected against current\nflow in excess of 200 i A (peak) .\nControl-Panel Assembly\n\n}\t\n\nThis unit was mounted on the wall of the subject\'s sleep compartment,\nwithin easy reach of the sleep restraint. Front-panel controls included the\npower switch, a mode-selection switch, tape -recorder -selection switch,\nand a subject gain-factor potentiometer. The circuitry accomplished\nelectrode testing, signal amplification, and data analysis, and provided\noutputs to the analog-tape recorders and the spacecraft telemetry system.\nThe electrode-test section of the control-panel assembly performed\nautomatic testing of each recording electrode before the sleep period began.\nThe front panel, readily visible to the subject in the sleep compartment\nwhile applying the cap, contained a series of indicator lamps, each representing one sponge-electrode sensor in the cap. The lamps were arranged in a\nconfiguration simulating the relative position on the head. After the subject\ndonned the cap, he moved the mode-selection switch from the off to the test\nposition, thereby activating the test circuitry. A small test current (=10 uA)\npassed through the single ground electrode to each of the six recording electrodes in succession, and the amount of current passed by each electrode was\nsensed to provide an indication of interelectrode resistance. If a given electrode were in proper scalp contact, its resistance was 50 000 0 or less, and\nthis cond.\'ition was indicated by illumination of the corresponding lamp on the\npanel display. Improper contact, indicated by failure of any lamp to illuminate, ust.ally could be resolved by slightly rocking the sensor to position the\nelectrode tip through the hair and against the scalp.\n5\t\n\n,\n\nInflight Data Analysis\nThe data-analysis equipment also had been designed to meet the limitaLions imposed by spaceflight. To supply sleep-stage information in near real\ntime while minimizing telemetry time and bandwidth, the EEG, EOG, and\nhead-motion signals were processed onboard by a small, special-purpose\ncomputational device. Since the unit\'s output was expressed in terms of\nsleep stage (i. e. , restricted to one of seven possible states) and changed\nonly slowly, the information content could be telemetered adequately by\ntransmitting only three bits at a rate of 1. 25 samples/sec (as opposed to\napproximately 32 bits at a rate of 100 samples/sec, which would be required\nto transmit the unprocessed data).\n\nn\n\nThe clinical criteria for evaluating sleep are based upon changes in the\nEEG and EOG patterns accompanying the observed behavioral changes during\nthe transition from the awake condition to one of deep sleep (Rechtschaffen\nand Kales, 1968). The awake, or nonsleep, state is characterized electroencephalographically by alpha activity (8-12 Hz) and/or low-amplitude, mixedfrequency activity. Stage 1, or very light sleep, is characterized by lowamplitude EEG signals of a predominantly lower frequency (5-7 Hz) than the\nawake state. During stage 2 sleep, the EEG exhibits a somewhat random\nfrequency, low-amplitude background activity upon which is superimposed\noccasional bursts (spindles) of I2-14 Hz activity and/or relatively high voltage\ntransient forms exceeding 0. 5 sec in duration (K complexes). Stage 3 is identified by the occurrence of relatively high amplitude (>75 PV) activity of 2 Hz or\nslower, which is present between 20 and 50% of the time, while stage 4 is indicated if such activity is present more than 507o of the time. The rapid eye\nmovement (REM) sleep stage, which has been highly associated with dreaming,\nis =.characterized by EEG signals much like stage 1 in appearance, but it is\nmost notably differentiated by rapid, jerking-type eye movements as detected\nby the EOG. A seventh category, stage 0, has been included in the analysis\nschema to indicate interruption of data or loss of physiological signals.\nOperation of the automatic onboard analysis equipment is indicated in a\nsimplified form in Fig. 5, showing the various logic .functions involving the\nthree input signals. In general, EEG alone was used to determine stages\nawake and 1, 2, 3, and 4 of sleep. EEG and EOG signals detected stage\nREM, and the EEG and accelerometer outputs recognized periods likely to\nbe contaminated by artifactual signals.\n\nE\t\n\nThe EEG-analysis section (Fig. 5, Section 1) considered activity in the\n0.7-13 Hz range derived from the paired central to paired occipital electrode\narray. The circuit behaved as an amplitude-weighted frequency meter for the\ndominant EEG activity (Frost, 1970). Each comparator was set to detect a\ndifferent EEG signal amplitude: high, or 100%; intermediate, or 20%; and\nlow, or 1%. The input EEG signal gain factor was adjusted once for each\nsubject (determined during preflightbaseline studies), such that the average\n6\n\npeak amplitude of the eyes -closed, waking EEG was made to fall midway\nbetween levels 2 and 3, i. e., approximately 60%. Thus, higher-voltage\nactivity during sleep frequently crossed the third level, whereas the lowervoltage signals of stage 1 usually exceeded only level 1 or 2.\t\nThe bistable circuit, associated with the level 1 and level 2 comparators,\n.triggered the negative-pulse generator if, and only if, level 1 and level 2 were\ncrossed successively in a negative-going direction. As a result, the number of\nconstant-amplitude pulses produced by the negative-pulse generator was proportional to the dominant frequency of the EEG and relatively independent of\nminor inflections. The positive-pulse generator, with output one-half the\namplitude of the negative-pulse generator, was triggered each time the volt- \t\nage exceeded level 3. The pulses from the two generators entered the mixer \t\namplifier, which supplied a composite .pulse form to the integrator circuit.\nThe integrator had a rise and fall time-constant of 10 sec, and consequently\t\nits output was a voltage level dependent upon the number and polarity of pulses\nrecorded during the preceding 10-sec epoch.\nIn terms of its influence on the integrator-circuit output, an EEG wave\nof very low voltage, i.e. , not exceeding level 2, had zero value; an intermediateamplitude wave had maximum value (negative pulse); and a high-amplitude\nwave (exceeding level 3) had a value of 50%, since it produced a negative\npulse and a positive pulse of one-half the amplitude. The schema included\neffective utilization of the progressive decline in frequency and the general\nincrease in amplitude seen with increasing sleep depth. The individual\'s\nEEG state therefore was expressed as a voltage level at the output of the\nintegrator. The awake state was associated with the highest output voltage,\nand progressive stages of sleep were accompanied by correspondingly lower\noutput values.\nThe integrator output entered a series of comparator circuits \'in the output section (Fig. 5, Section 4), where it was compared to previously determined\nvoltage ranges, each corresponding to one of the clinical stages. Thus, while\nthe EEG-analysis output remained within the range specified for a particular\nsleep stage, a corresponding voltage was supplied to the output section of the\nanalyzer.\nThe EEG-analysis section classified stage REM sleep as either stage 1\nor 2, due to its similarity in frequency and amplitude; however, true stage\nREM is distinguished by the occurrence of bursts of rapid, jerking eye movenlents. Although these events are sporadic throughout a REM period, they\ntypically occur with a frequency of at least one recognizable event in each\n30-sec epoch. During true stage 1-2 sleep, these events are absent. The\nfunction of the REM-detection circuitry (Fig. 5, Section 3) was (1) detection\nof events in the EOG channel which might be rapid eye movements, and\n(2) indication of stage REM if such events occurred during an EEG period\nrepresentative of stage T or 2,\n7\n\n9\n\ns\n\naa\na\n\nE\n\nQi\t\n\nAmplified EOG activity entered the REM-detection section and passed\nthrough a filter that limited the response to the 2. 0-4. 0 Hz range, thereby\noptimally separating true REMs from extraneous activity (e. g., EEG activity\ndetected by the EOG electrodes, slow eye movements, movement artifacts).\nThe signal next entered the EOG -transient-detector comparator, which detected the occurrence of transient EOG wave forms exceeding a value equal\nto 250% of either the average positive or the average negative voltage of the\nsimultaneously occurring EEG signal. (Averaging occurred continuously,\nutilizing an RC circuit with a 15-sec time constant.) Thus, a change in EEG\nbackground-activity level during the sleep period caused the EOG-detection\nreference levels to reset automatically for proper relative values, thereby\nminimizing the chance of false triggering by EEG wave forms that might have\nbeen recorded by the EOG electrodes.\nThe EOG system also may have detected transient EEG events (such as\nK complexes), and since these arise abruptly from the background, it may\nhave led to triggering of the EOG-transient detector in spite of the automatic\nthreshold-adjustment feature. Consequently, the EEG-transient-detector\ncircuitry sensed such events, operating on the EEG channel in a manner\nidentical to that of the EOG-transient detector, and recognized EEG events\nwhich exceeded a value equivalent to 350% of the average positive or negative\nEEG voltage.\nThe remainder of Section 3 of the logic circuitry then permitted an output indication of stage REM only if the following criteria were met: (1) an EOG\nevent was detected by the EOG-transient detector, (2) no EEG event was detected by the EEG-transient detector within a time window extending from 1. 4\nsec before until 1.4 sec after the EOG event, and (3) the EEG-analysis section\nindicated the presence of stage 1 or 2 of sleep. If these conditions were met,\na 30-sec output indication of stage REM occurred and was fed to the output\nsection, where its presence superseded the sleep-stage output of the EEGanalysis section in terms of final output to the telemetry system. Since each\nREM reset the 30-sec timer in the REM-detection section, if REMs were detected with a frequency exceeding one per 30 sec, a continuous output indication\nof stage REM occurred.\nAlthough the data-acquisition methods were designed to minimize the\noccurrence of artifactual signals, it was not possible to eliminate them completely. The majority are related to major body movements of the subject,\nparticularly when such motions result in changing forces exerted directly on\nthe cap recording electrodes. The artifact-detection circuitry (Fig. 5,\nSection 2) was designed. to prevent signals with a high probability of artifactual\ncontamination from influencing the sleep -stage -determination systems.\nThe excessive-amplitude detector minimized the occurrence of false\nsleep-stage determinations by disabling the EEG- analysis section and the\nREM-detection section during and for 4 sec following the occurrence of an\n-8\n\nF\n\nexcessively high (i. e., nonphysiological) EEG signal, thus preventing a change\nin the sleep-stage output section as a result of the artifact. A dual comparator\nproduced a trigger pulse if either the positive or the negative phase of the EEGsignal voltage exceeded a value of 60076 (using the same relative amplitude\nscale here as in the EEG-analysis section), which was considered to be in\nexcess of the usual physiological range. The resultant pulse started the 4-see\nartifact-detection timer, which in turn operated an electronic switch for the\n4-sec period. If the timer received trigger pulses at a rate equal to or exceeding one per 4 sec, the disable switch remained continuously activated.\nThe accelerometer contained in the preamplifier served as another means\ndetecting periods when artifactual contamination was highly probable. \t Head\nfor\nmotion produced an output voltage roughly proportional to the rapidity of the\nmotion; thus, a relatively high voltage output from this device was more likely\nto, be associated with artifact.\t The accelerometer comparator in the artifactdetection section was set such that it was triggered by voltages equivalent to\nchanges in acceleration of approximately 0. 2 g in either the vertical or the\nlateral axis.\t When triggered, the accelerometer comparator in turp -reset\nthe 4-sec artifact-detection timer, and the disable switch was consequently\nactivated for the duration of and for 4 sec following the movement.\n\nF\n\n`- ---\n\nOutputs from the six sleep-stage comparators and the REM indicator were\ncombined in the output section of the analysis circuitry (Fig. 5, Section 4) by an\nanalog adder that provided the single output line to the spacecraft telemetry\nsystem.\t The analyzer output flowed to the spacecraft telemetry system at a\nrate of 1. 25 samples/sec.\t During each pass over a ground receiving station,\nthe telemetered information updated a comprehensive display terminal at\nMission Control.\n\ns\t :,\n\nGround-Based Data Analysis\nAutomatic Analysis Inflight\nDuring a sleep monitoring session, true real-time data was available\nonly during the few minutes when the spacecraft passed over a ground tracking\nstation. Throughout the frequent periods when the spacecraft was out of\ncommunication range, the sleep-stage data was accumulated by the spacecraft\ntelemetry recorder and transmitted to ground at a high rate during a subsequent\ntracking-station pass. The tracking stations, in turn, relayed the telemetered\nsleep-stage information to Mission Control. Consequently, the data ultimately\nreceived during a sleep.period was somewhat sporadic, ranging from actual\nreal time to delays of up to several hours. Data-processing equipment in\nMission Control collated the incoming data so that the time relationships were\npreserved, and eventually a complete tabulation of sleep stage versus elapsed\n\ntime evolved,\ne\t\n\n9\n1\n\nr\'\nk.-\n\nAlthough data was telemetered at a rate of 1. 25 sleep-stage samples/\nsec (75 samples/min), a subject\'s sleep stage does not typically change more\noften than two or three times each minute, and it is often stable for several\nminutes without change. The data-processing system was consequently\nprogrammed to indicate only the time and the sleep stage when a change of\nlevel occurred. The resultant listing of sleep-stage information versus\ntime was transferred to The Methodist Hospital, where the computer facilities\nof the Neurophysiology Laboratories and the Baylor Institute of Computer\nScience were employed to provide the final data analysis.\nThe end product was a compact graphic plot that showed the complete\nprofile of sleep stage versus time over the course of a sleep period. The\ndata was displayed at a horizontal resolution of approximately 2 in. /hr,\nWith a vertical span of approximately 4 in. , thereby providing an observer\nWith an overall summary or profile of the sleep period. A statistical summary of the all-night data was also supplied for each sleep period, and these\nvalues for the following sleep parameters were included: total rest-period\ntime, total sleep time, total awake time, sleep latency, number of arousals,\naccumulated time in each sleep stage, percentage of total sleep time occupied\nby each sleep stage, and REM latency.\n\ni\n\n3\n\nVisual Analysis Postflight\nAt the conclusion of each Skylab mission, the onboard data tapes were\nreturned by the crew, and this data was then analyzed by conventional visual\nscoring techniques (Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968) after playback onto a\ngraphic recorder. The various aspects of the sleep recordings and the\ncriteria used in scoring them follow.\n(1) Total Rest Time: The period between the time of retiring to bed\nuntil the time of arising for the day.\n(2) Total Awake Time: The total time spent in the awake state between\nthe times of retiring to bed and arising for the day.\n(3) \'Total Sleep Time: Total rest time minus total awake time.\n(4) Sleep Latency: The elapsed time from retiring\'to bed until the\nsubject attains a sleep stage other than stage 1 or awake.\n(5) Sleep-Stage Percentage: The total time spent in a particular stage\nof sleep divided by the total sleep time.\n(6) REM Latency: The elapsed. time from sleep onset (occurrence of\na stage other than awake or stage 1 after retiring to bed) until\nthe onset of the first stage REM.\n10\n\n1\n\ni\nIj\n(7) Number of Awakening s: The total number of discrete awake periods\noccurring throughout the sleep period. (The period of wakefulness\nat the beginning of the rest period and the final awakening of the\nnight were excluded from this measure.) A discrete awake period\nis a period extending from the first appearance of stage awake\nuntil the appearance of either stage 2, 3, 4, or REM. Thus, a\nsection of awake, followed by a section of stage 1, followed by\nanother awake section was classified as only one discrete awake\nperiod. Stage awake was scored only if an arousal persisted for\nat least 10 sec.\nExperimental Design\nOne crew member participated in the sleep monitoring activities during\neach Skylab flight. Preflight baseline data was obtained on the participating\nsubjects during three consecutive nights of sleep monitoring, using portable\napparatus functionally identical to the onboard hardware. The astronaut\nstudied during the 28-day mission was recorded in his own home two months\nprior to launch, while the subjects of the 59- and 84-day missions were\nmonitored in the preflight quarantine facility two weeks before their respective\nlaunches. In addition, a standard clinical electroencephalogram was performed\non each subject prior to the flight to permit precise EEG-amplitude determinations\nfor calibration of the flight hardware.\nInflight monitoring was accomplished during 12 selected nights of the 28day mission (nights 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 24, 25, and 26), during\n20 nights of the 59-day mission (nights 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 29,\n33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 52, 55, 56, and 57), and during 18 nights of the 84-day\nflight (nights 3, 4, 10, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 72, 77, 80, 81,\nand 82). Operational factors associated with the activation and function of\nvarious spacecraft systems prevented recordings during the initial period of\neach flight.\n\n5\t\n\nCrew bedtime was typically 10 p.m., and the scheduled sleep period\nterminated at 6 a.m. , although occasional deviations from this schedule were\nnecessitated by work requirements not associated with the sleep monitoring\nexperiment. During the last week of the 28- and 59-day missions, sleeping\nschedules were adjusted forward by a total of four hours (i. e. , typical bedtime\nbecame 6 p.m.). An adjustment of two hours was made on days 20 and 22 of\nthe 28-day mission, and there was a similar change of two hours on days 51\nand 53 of the 59-day mission. During the 84-day mission, schedule alterations were made during the last three days only, and consequently only one\nday (day 82) of sleep monitoring was affected. On this day the bedtime was\nadvanced approximately two hours (to approximately 8 p.m.), and the sub ject was permitted a 10-hr total rest time (i. e., the time of awakening r\'e\nmained approximately 6 a.m.). These schedule alterations were necessitated\n11\n\nj\n\ni\n\nA\n\nby the activities associated with splashdown and recovery operations, which\nrequired early awakening on the final day of the mission.\nUpon return to Earth, postflight baseline studies were performed on each\nsleep monitoring participant. After the 28-day mission, recordings were done\non nights 4, 6, and 8, and in the case of the 59-day mission, on the second,\nfourth, and sixth nights ,following splashdown. Following the 84-day mission,\nrecordings were made on the first, second, and sixth nights.\nOperational Factors\nA period of elevated temperatures in the Skylab workshop prior to the\narrival of the first crew (a result of loss of a portion of the solar heat shield\nduring launch) resulted in two problems with respect to the sleep monitoring\nactivities scheduled for the first mission. A number of the recording-cap\nelectrodes suffered partial dehydration, and as a result, most of the data was\nlost during one scheduled recording night. In addition, the analog-tape recording system was damaged, and only two nights were successfully recorded.\nThe recording-cap problem during the first (28-day) mission necessitated\nuse of caps intended for use on future flights and which had been stored in a\ncooler location on board the spacecraft.\nThe crew of the second manned Skylab mission (59 days) was supplied\nwith a repair kit, which permitted refurbishment of the damaged recording\ncaps by injection of supplementary electrolyte gel prior to use. In addition,\nrepair of the recording system was attempted prior to the first night of recording. In general, these steps were successful, although one additional\nnight was lost during the 59-day mission due to recording cap problems,\nand six nights of tape-recorded data were lost near the end of the mission\nwhen the recording system again failed.\nPrior to launch of the Skylab workshop, the plan was to monitor sleep\nduring only the .first and second manned missions, and consequently only\nenough recording caps were placed on board to provide one for each scheduled\nnight. When the schedule was later changed to include sleep monitoring on\nthe final, or 84-day, flight, there were not enough caps remaining on board\nto permit use of a new unit for each recording session. Instead, the subject\nreused a single cap several times and injected additional electrolyte gel into\nthe sponge electrodes before donning the cap each night. This technique was\nsatisfactory, and the data quality remained high. Of the 18 sessions attempted\nduring the 84-day mission, 17 were successfully accomplished. One night\n(night 50) was lost when power to the onboard hardware was lose after approximately two hours of recording.\n\nS\n\nF\t\n\nA significant data loss also occurred on two additional nights of the\n28-day mission and on one other night of the 59-day mission, stemming\n12\n\nfrom ground-based problems in the data-processing system.\nIn spite of the unforeseen problems, however, successful near realtime monitoring was accomplished on nine of the 12 attempted recording\nnights during the 28 -day mission, on 18 of the 20 nights attempted on the\n59-day mission, and on 17 of the 18 attempted sessions of the 84-day flight.\nPostflight return of the analog tapes permitted visual confirmation of the\nresults on two of the nine nights of the 28 -day mission, on 12 of the 18 nights\nof the 59-day mission, and on 17 of the 18 nights of the 84-day mission.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe final results described below represent the best available estimates\nof the various sleep parameters. The results are, when possible, those obtained by visual analysis of the tape-recorded EEG, EOG, and head-motion\nsignals, since this method is considered the most reliable and the least influenced by various artifactual components that may be present. In the\ninstances where this was not possible, due to loss of recorded data on several\nnights, the results of onboard automatic analysis have been utilized after application of certain corrective factors based upon past performance of the system\nand, in the case of the 59-day flight, upon correlation of the inflight results\nwith those of visual analysis for the nights on which both types of information\nwere available.\nModification of Automatic-Analysis Results\nThe uncorrected results of automatic analysis consistently underestimated\nstage REM sleep. This occurred because the criteria for continuous stage REM\nindication used by the automatic system included the occurrence of at least one\ndetectable rapid eye motion per 30-sec epoch. If such an eye motion did not\noccur, the output reverted to stage 1 or 2, as determined by EEG criteria\nalone. In most individuals, true stage REM occasionally occurs for periods\nlonger than 30 sec in the absence of eye motion of sufficient amplitude to be\ndetected by the automatic circuitry. Typically, then, the automatic system\'s\noutput during a continuous stage REM period fluctuated between stages 1, REM,\nand 2. Such periods usually were readily identified by inspection of the plotted\nsleep profile. When the automatic data was modified by the assignment to\nstage REM of all time within such a period, the overall results were significantly\nenhanced. Such modification introduces an element of subjectivity into otherwise\nobjective data; however, we believe this is justified in this case, since past experience has confirmed its validity.\nOther than eliminating certain obviously artifactual sections of data (e. g.\nsections near the start of each sleep period, associated with cap-donning and\nelectrode-testing procedures), the REM-modification step was the only corrective\n13\n\nr\n\n7\n\n.. ,\t\n\n.3, ..^\t\n\n^._...\n\n0\n\n\t\n\nOR\n\n0\t\n\n11\n\nfactor instituted during the inflight portions of the Skylab missions.\nReliability of Automatic-Analysis Results\nN\n\n,Y\n\nAfter the 59-day mission, we compared the results of modified inflight\nanalysis with those of visual analysis of the taped data for 11 of the first 12\nrecording nights. The average (mean) error of automatic analysis based upon\nvisually determined total rest-period time was as follows: total rest-period\ntime, +17o; total sleep time, +4 01o; sleep latency, -0. 3%. The average (mean)\nerror of automatic analysis in sleep-stage determination (as compared to the\nsame visually determined parameters) was as follows: % stage 1, +5. 67o;\nstage 2, -0. 476; % stage 3, -10. 67o; % stage 4, -0. 77o; % stage REM, +6. 176\xe2\x80\xa2\nIn most cases, then, automatic analysis gave satisfactory estimates of\nthe actual value. The worst case, % stage 3 sleep, was apparently a result of\nthe particular subject\'s sleeping pattern, in which a large proportion of the\nmisclassified epochs were borderline in terms of stage 2 versus stage 3. The\nunderestimation was consistent throughout all 11 comparison nights. The %u\nstage REM overestimation, on the other hand, was not consistent and appeared\nto result solely from the inherent limitations of the automatic-analysis scheme\nin detecting this stage and in rejecting certain artifacts.\nSimilar comparisons between visual and automatic analysis were made\nfollowing the 84-day flight for the 17 successful monitoring sessions. In this\ncase, the average (mean) error of automatic analysis compared to the visually\ndetermined total rest-period time was as follows: total rest-period time,\n+1\'. 276 ; total sleep time, +4. 4 %; sleep latency, +0. 9 76 . The average error of\nautomatic analysis in sleep-stage determination (as compared to the visually\ndetermined parameters) was as follows: % stage 1, +1. 676 ; 0/6 stage 2, -11.4\xc2\xb016;\nstage 3, +7. 97o; % stage 4, +6. 1%6; % stage REM, -4. 27o.\nCorrection and Regression Techniques\nRegression analysis, after correlation of automatic and visual results,\nprovided a means for further modifying the results of automatic analysis for\nthose six nights of the 59 -day mission unconfirmed by visual analysis (i. e.,\nnights 42, 45, 48, 52, 56, and 57, for which the analog-tape data was lost).\nAs noted above, the overall correlation between visual and automatic\nresults for stage REM percentage was low and consequently could not be\nutilized for reliable prediction of the remaining six values. However, it\nwas determined that stage REM values below 20 %, as indicated by automatic\nanalysis, were better correlated with visual results; consequently, regression\nanalysis for this stage was based upon correlations of only six of the 11 nights\n(discarding nights 7, 8, 9, 12, and 29)\xe2\x80\xa2 Corrected REM values were thus\npredicted for five of the six remaining nights, discarding the value (30.4 \xc2\xb010)\nfor day 48, which exceeded 20%.\n14\n\n,m\n\na:\n\nt4\n\nfli}r\ti\n\nThese statistical maneuvers provided a consistent means for utilizing\nall the available information. The values obtained are included in the results\npresented below and were subjected to further statistical analysis along with\nthe visual-analysis results, although it was determined that the overall significance of the results was the same, whether or not these values were included.\n\n,\n\nAnalysis of Variance\nY\n\nFinally, for each mission, preflight, inflight, and postflight conditions\nfor each parameter were treated by an analysis of variance. A posteriori\ncomparisons were made in cases where the overall F test reached conventional\nlevels of statistical significance (p <0.05).\nIn summary, with respect to the final results outlined below (Results\nSection), of the nine nights recorded during the 28-day mission, only the\nfirst two are based upon visual analysis. The remainder are based upon\nthe modified results of automatic analysis. For the 59-day mission, the\nresults of the first 12 nights are based upon visual analysis, while the last\nsic are automatic results modified both inflight in terms of REM period and\npostflight by the application of corrective factors based upon visual/ automatic\ncomparison on the first 12 nights. For the 84-day mission, all 17 nights are\nbased upon the results of visual analysis.\n\n3\n\nData Format\t\n\n1\n\nThe data obtained during the three Skylab sleep monitoring experiments\nis presented in three forms: (1) sleep profiles showing the entire data set for\neach night in the form of a plot of sleep stage versus time; (2) tables in which\nparameters derived from the sleep profiles are listed for each recording session\nof the mission; and (3) graphs in which selected parameters are plotted versus\nmission day to illustrate trends and to compare data from the three flights.\n\nSleep Profiles\nPreflight Baseline Studies\n\ns\t\n\n\'\t\n\nThese profiles are based upon human visual analysis of the data obtained\nduring the three preflight baseline studies of each participating crew member.\nData for the 28-day mission, obtained two months prior to launch, is shown in\n-Fig. 6. Results for the 59-day flight, obtained two weeks prior to launch, are\nillustrated in Fig. 7, and those for the 84-day mission, also obtained two weeks\nprior to launch, are presented in Fig. 8.\n\n15\n\n\t\n\nInflight Data\nThe sleep profiles showing inflight data are of two types: those based\nupon onboard automatic analysis and obtained by telemetry in near real-time,\nand those obtained postflight by human visual analysis of the tape-recorded\nflight data returned by the crews.\nAutomatic-Analysis Profiles. The data presented in these plots illustrates\nthe complete results of automatic analysis for the particular night under study.\nOccasional gaps in the plots indicate periods when the telemetry signal was lost\n(due to difficulties in the tracking and data-processing systems). The raw data\npresented in these illustrations was, as explained in the section on modification\nof automatic-analysis results, above, subjected to further modification techniques in order to eliminate artifacts and to increase the reliability of the\nstage REM indication. The areas subjected to modification are indicated by\nhorizontal lines above the data plots (labeled M on the vertical scale), and the\ntype of modification is indicated by the letter above the horizontal line. Thus,\na line labeled R signifies that all data below the line was assigned to stage REM,\nregardless of the actual stage shown in the raw-data plot. Similarly, lines labeled A indicate that all data below the line is reassigned to the awake state.\nThese plots, with the indicated modifications, were utilized for sleep\nassessment during the inflight period of each mission, and they were the best\nestimate of the individual sleep characteristics prior to the analysis of the\nanalog tapes after the conclusion of the mission. Data for the 28-day mission\nis presented in Figs. 9-12. Day 5 was of poor quality due to recording -cap\nproblems (see above, Operational Factors). Day 7 was uninterpretable due to\nexcessive dat<,-loss periods. Day 11 was degraded because of further recording\ncap problems, and day 25 was incomplete, since the subject neglected to don the\nrecording cap at the start of the actual sleep period.\nAutomatic -analysis results for the 59-day mission are shown in Figs. 13\nY\t\ng\n19. Day 39 was lost due to faulty electrode-cap function.\nThe results for the 84-day mission are presented in Figs. 20-26. Data\non day 50 after two hours, due to a power loss in the onboard hardware.\n\nt\t\n\nwas\n\nr\t\n\nVisual Analysis. These profiles are the result of human visual analysis\nof the data played back from the onboard analog-tape recording system. These\ntapes were returned by the crew at the end of each mission, and the data thus\nserves as a check on the results obtained by automatic analysis during the\nmission.\n\nlast,\n\nThe results for the 28-day mission are shown in Fig. 27 (days 5 and 6);\ndata for the remaining 10 nights was lost due to a tape-recorder malfunction.\n\np\n16\t\n\nVisual-analysis results for the 59-day flight are shown in Figs. 28-32\n(days 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 29, 33, and 36). Results for the latter\nportion of the mission (days 35, 42, 45, 48, 52, 55, 56, and 57) were lost due\ntown onboard tape-recorder malfunction. Visual-analysis profiles for the 84day mission are illustrated in Figs. 33-39.\nPostflight Baseline Studies\nAs in the preflight studies, these profiles are based upon human visual\nanalysis of the data obtained during three postflight monitoring sessions on\neach of the Skylab sleep monitoring experiment subjects. Following the 28day mission, as shown in Fig. 40, data was obtained on the fourth (R+3),\nsixth (R+5), and eighth (R+7) nights following recovery. After the 59-day\nflight (Fig. 41), recordings were made on nights 2 (R+1), 4 (R+3), and 6\n(R+5). The results for night 2 were incomplete, since the subject terminated\nrecording after approximately four hours due to discomfort from the recording\ncap. Following the 84-day mission (Fig. 42), the subject was studied on the\nfirst (R+O), second (R+1), and sixth (R+5) nights.\nTables\nThe basic sleep data from each all-night sleep profile, described above,\nwas subjected to further ground-based computer analysis in order to determine\nselective parameters of value in estimating the overall quantity and quality of\nsleep during the mission. In all cases, the results of visual analysis (V) were\nused whenever this information was available. For the case of the 28 -day\nmission (Table I), visual-analysis results were available for the first two\nnights only. For the final seven nights, the data is based upon the modified\nresults of automatic analysis (MA), as shown in Figs. 10-12.\nDuring the 59-day mission (Table II), a tape-recorder malfunction resulted in data loss for visual analysis on days 39 through 57. The data shown\nfor these nights in Table II was based upon modified automatic-analysis\n(i. e., Figs. 17-19) results, which were further enhanced by the correlation\nand regression analysis technique described previously (MCA).\n\nF\n\nE\n\nA\n\nAll data in Table III for the 84-day mission is based upon visual analysis.\n_ The average values shown in the tables represent the means of the values\nin each category, preflight, inflight, and postflight.\n\nGraphs\nThe graphs of individual sleep parameters are utilized below in the discussion of changes in sleep characteristics during Skylab. These plotted values\n17\ni\n\n\t\n\nare, in all instances, the same as those indicated in the tables for the corresponding mission.\nData Quality\n.fi\t\ni\n\nData quality, as evaluated by visual inspection of the signals played back\nfrom the analog tapes returned at the conclusion of each mission, was generally\nexcellent. Although recorder malfunctions occurred during the 28- and 59-day\nmissions, the data recorded prior to the failures was, in both instances, of\nhigh quality. During the 84-day flight, the recorded signals were of clinical\nquality throughout the mission.\nSelected examples of the EEG, EOG, and head-motion signals as played\nback from the onboard capes are shown in Figs. 55-60. Figs. 55 and 56 illustrate the transition from the awake, alert state through the various stages of\nsleep for the scientist-pilot on day 6 of the 28-day mission. A similar series\nfor the subject of the 59-day flight is illustrated in Figs. 57 and 58, which were\nobtained during day 29. Examples from day 3 of the 84-day mission are shown\nin Figs. 59 and 60.\n\n^N\nI\ti,\n\nRESULTS\n\nSleep Latency\nSleep latency is the amount of elapsed time from the onset of the sleep\nperiod (i. e. , bedtime) until the first appearance of stage 2 sleep. Sleep-latency\ncharacteristics observed during the three Skylab missions are summarized in \t\nFig. 43. Average inflight, preflight, and postflight figures for this parameter\nare indicated in Tables I, II, and III. Sleep latency varied considerably during\nthe 28 -day mission (Fig. 43A), ranging from a low value of 3. 6 minutes on day\n21 to a maximum value of 45 minutes on day 19. Day 19 (Fig. 11) was, however,\nthe only instance in which the latency exceeded the preflight values, and the aver age inflight value of 18 minutes actually represents a decrease of 20 minutes as\ncompared to the preflight average of 37. 8 minutes. Postflight values were all\nrelatively low but well within the inflight range. Statistically, the inflight and\npostflight latencies were less than the preflight values (p <0.01)\n\n!`\n\nNo statistically significant changes in sleep latency were noted during the\n59 -day mission, as indicated in Fig. 43B, although on several days the values\n\nwere somewhat above the preflight average of 12 minutes. This parameter\n.ranged from a low of 4 minutes on day 21 to a maximum of 24 minutes on day\n45. A cyclic fluctuation in sleep latency was suggested, with maxima near\ndays 10,- 29, 45, and 52. The inflight average value (12.6 minutes), however,\'\n18\n\nalmost exactly the same as the preflight value. The postflight \'latencies,\naveraging 9.6 minutes, are only slightly less than either the pre- or inflight\nmeasurements -\n\nwas\n\nSleep latency during the 84-day mission averaged almost the same inflight (15.6 minutes) as preflight (16. 2 minutes), but it dropped to an average\nof 7.8 minutes postflight (Table III). Although the averages do not reflect a\nsignificant change, inspection of Fig. 43C reveals a preponderance of longer\nlatencies in the first half of the mission and a decline as the flight progressed.\nThe average value for the first half (days 3 through 40) was 21. 4 minutes, while\nthat for the latter half (days 45 through 82) was 9. 7 minutes.\nIn general then, there was no evidence of difficulty in falling asleep in\neither the 28- or 59-day mission, while in the 84-day flight, values somewhat\nabove baseline were seen in the first half of the mission but declined to normal\nor below normal in the final portion...\nSleep Time\nA commonly used measure of sleep adequacy is the total sleep time obtained in a given sleep period (i. e. , total rest-period time minus total time\nspent awake). Fig. 44 illustrates the total rest-period length (overall amplitude of vertical bars), total sleep time (solid.portion of bars), and total awake\ntime (dashed portion of bars) for each Skylab recording night and for the preand postflight baseline studies.\n\nh\n\nIt is apparent that in the 28 -day mission (Fig. 44A), there was a reduction of total sleep time throughout the inflight period as compared to the preand postflight studies. Postflight, total sleep time was significantly greater\nthan the pre- and inflight values (p <0. 05 and 0. 01, respectively). As indicated\nin Table I, the inflight average of 6. 0 hours is almost one hour less than the\npreflight value of 6. 9 hours and more than tv,*o hours less than the postflight\naverage (8-5 hours). This decrease in sleep time, however, was due not to an\nunusual amount of time spent in the awake state but to a reduction in the total\nrest-peritad time itself. The subject thus slept quite well on most nights while\nhe was in !red; however, he did not spend as much time in bed as he did during\nstudies either before or after the mission.\n\ni\n\nThe postflight, average value for total rest-period time (8. 9 hours) was\nsignificantly higher than the inflight average ( p <0. 01) but did not differ signifi\ncantly from the preflight value.\nNo significant changes in the total sleep/total rest characteristics were\nobtained during the 59-day mission, as shown graphically in Fig. 44B. The\ntotal rest time (overall height of bars, Fib. 44B), which. averaged 7. 3 hours\ninflight (Table II), was only slightly lower than eitherthe preflight average of\n7.5 hours or thepostflight, value of 7.8 hours. In terms of total sleep time\n19\n.,_\t\n\n_w\t\n\n-=-\n\n\t\ni\n\n(solid bars, Fig. 44B), although there was considerable fluctuation, only one\nday (52) was below the range established during the preflight series, and the\nsubject obtained in excess of 5 hours\' sleep on all other nights. The inflight\naverage value of 6. 3 hours (Table II) is nearly the same as the preflight\naverage (6. 4 hours) and slightly lower than the postflight results (average,\t\n6. 6 hours) .\n\nR\n\nA wide range of variation in the total rest and total sleep times was\nseen during the 84-day mission (Fig. 44C). Total rest time ranged from\na.minimum of 6.4 hours on day 10 to a maximum of 9.8 hours on days 24\nand 82. This parameter averaged 8. 06 hours preflight, dropped by 30 minutes to 7. 56 hours inflight, and then rose to 7.67 hours postflight. Although\nmost of the inflight period was marked by considerable variation from one\nrecording session to the next, there was a consistently lowered total rest\ntime during the observations of the first 19 days. The five values of this\nperiod averaged 6. 86 hours, or 1. 2 hours below the preflight average.\nTotal sleep time tended to parallel total rest time, and thus long periods\nof time spent awake during the night were, in this mission as in the others,\nrare. Sleep time ranged from a low of 4.88 hours on day 4 to a high of 9. 37\nhours on day 24. The inflight average value of 6. 69 hours is about 36 minutes\nbelow the preflight average of 7. 29 hours but is approximately 10 minutes\nhigher than the postflight result of 6. 53 hours. As in the case of total rest\ntime, total sleep time also was considerably lower during the .first-l9-day\nperiod. During this time, the average value was 5. 87 hours, or 1. 42 hours\nbelow the preflight average.\nOf interest is that while the initial 19-day period was characterized by a\nreduced time in bed and correspondingly reduced total rest time, it was also\nmarked by a higher value for total awake time (0. 99 hours average) compared\nto either the preflight average (0. 77 hours) or the overall inflight average (0.87\nhours).\n\na\n...E\n\n\'.\t\nSleep-Stage Characteristics\nSleep-stage characteristics for the three missions, expressed as percentages of the total sleep time for each recording night, are illustrated in\nFigs. 45-47. Average percent figures for the various stages in the preflight,\ninflight, and postflight periods are listed in Tables I, II, and III. Comparisons\nof individual stage characteristics for the three missions are illustrated in\nFigs. 48-52.\nIf the average values are considered, stages 1, 2, 3, and REM were not\nsignificantly altered during the inflight period of the 28-day mission (Fig. 45).\nStage 1 occupied 5. 316 of the total sleep time preflight and averaged 6% inflight\nand 5. 176 postflight. The day-to-day inflight characteristics show a considerable\n20\n1\n\nj\t\ny \xe2\x96\xba\t\n\nF\n\nfluctuation in stage 1 percent, with a tendency toward slightly decreased values\nin the latter portions of the flight (days 19 through 26). Stage 3, averaging\n14. 8% in the preflight period, rose slightly to an average of 16. 0% inflight\nand dropped to 1.2-276 postflight. As seen in Fig. 45, a small increase in\nthe stage 3 percent average was largely a result of moderate increases in\nthis stage on days 24 and 26 at the end of the mission. Stage REM decreased\nonly slightly from a 22. 2% preflight average to 17. 9% inflight, although again\nthere was considerable variation throughout the flight, with some tendency\ntoward a more marked decrease near.the end of the mission. The postflight\nstage REM average (25.076) was somewhat higher than either the pre- or inflight values, but it did not attain statistical significance.\nFairly clear-cut changes were seen in stage 2 and stage 4 percentages.\nIn both cases, the most obvious alterations were seen in the last few days of\nthe flight. Stage 2 dropped from an average of 54. 8% preflight to 43. 4% inflight, returning to 56. 6% postflight. These differences, however, were not\nsignificant. Similarly, stage 4 rose from 2. 9% preflight to 16. 776 inflight,\nthen dropped significantly (p <0. 05) postflight to 1. 1%.\nThus, the 28-day mission was characterized by increased percentages\nof stages 3 and 4 and corresponding decreases of stages REM, 1, and 2, with\nthe alterations confined primarily to the last few days of the .flight.\n\n0\n\n,-\t\n\nSleep-stage features for the 59-day mission are illustrated in Fig. 46,\nand average values are tabulated in Table II. Stage 1, averaging 8. 8% preflight, showed considerable variation inflight but averaged almost the same\n(8. 9%). The postflight average value of 10. 2% was only slightly above the inflight result. Stage 2 remained fairly consistent throughout (preflight, 56. 3%;\ninflight, 59.7%; postflight, 57.8%). Thus, neither stage 1 nor stage 2 changed\nsignificantly. Stage 3 was similar inflight (17. 5%) and preflight (17.4%) and also\nexhibited a change near the termination of the flight; tending to increase slightly.\nThe postflight average of 10. 1%, however, was significantly lower (p <0. 01) than\neither the pre- or inflight values. This subject showed very little stage 4 sleep\nin his preflight study (2.876 ), and this parameter decreased significantly (P<0. 05)\ninflight (1. 4%) and postflight (0. 416) (p <0. 05). Stage REM showed the greatest\nalteration, dropping from 14. 7% during the preflight baseline series to 12. 176\ninflight, and then rising significantly (p <0. 01) to 21. 6% postflight. This postflight increase in REM was also significantly greater than the preflight value\n(p <0. 05). The REM decrease seen inflight was most prominent in the final\nphase of the study (days 52, 56, and 57).\nSleep-stage characteristics for the 84-day flight are summarized in Fig.\n47, and the average values are tabulated in Table III. Stage 1, averaging 8. 9%\npreflight, dropped inflight to 6. 8%, then rose postflight to 9. 4%, a value slightly\nhigher than the preflight average. There were no-clear-cut trends discernible\nover the inflight course of the mission. The stage 2 values were relatively\'\nconsistent during the inflight period, and the average value of 58. 576\n21\n\nidentical to the preflight average. Postflight, stage 2 showed a small increase,\naveraging 66. 1% for the three days. As indicated in Fig. 47, the stage 2 values\nof the first two postflight days were significantly higher than any of the values\npreflight or inflight. Stage 3 was not significantly different inflight (8. 8%) as\ncompared to the preflight value (7. 1%). Postflight, however, this parameter\nfell to an average of 2. 711 , with all three values .falling well below the preand inflight averages. This subject showed very little stage 4 preflight,\naveraging only 0. 2%, and maintained a low level throughout the flight, with\nthe inflight average at 0. 577. There was a further reduction postflight, with\nthe average value less than 0. 17o. Stage REM percent averaged 25. 3 preflight,\nand the inflight average remained at 25. 37o. There was considerable variation\nin this parameter over the course of the mission, however, but no definite\ntrends were observed. Although the postflight average of 21. 8% was slightly\nlower than either the preflight or inflight average value, it is obvious (Fig. 47)\nthat this parameter was not stable in the postflight period. The value of 12. 1%\non the first postflight night is significantly lower than any of the pre- or inflight\nvalues for this characteristic. On the other hand, the value of 34. 676 seen on\nthe sixth postflight night is considerably higher than any of the values seen\npreflight or inflight.\nREM Latency\nREM latency is the elapsed time from sleep onset (i. e. , the first appearance of stage 2 sleep) until the onset of the first stage REM period of the night.\nBecause of the relative unreliability of this measurement when derived from\nthe results of automatic analysis, only the values obtained from visual analysis\nhave been reported below.\nCompared to preflight values, this measure was shortened during the\npostflight periods of the 28- and 59-day missions. During the 28-day flight\n(Fig. 53A and Table I), the REM latency averaged 1. 5 hours preflight and\n1. 1 hours postflight, or a decrease of 24 minutes. Although substantial, this\ndecrease was not statistically significant. The phenomenon was more apparent\nduring the 59-day mission, as illustrated in Fig. 53B. In the preflight baseline\nperiod, the values ranged from 1. 6 to 2. 2 hours, with an average latency of 1. 9\nhours (see Table II). The inflight values showed considerable .fluctuation, but\nthe average of 2. 1 hours was not significantly different compared to the preflight\nresults. In the postflight period, however, the latency dropped to 0. 9 hours,\nwhich represented a decrease of 1 hour below the preflight findings. This postflight- REM latency was significantly (p < 0. 01) less than both pre- and inflight\nvalues.\n\nI\n\nREM latencies during the 84-day mission (Fig. 53C and Table III) showed\nlittle change in the inflight period compared to either pre- or postflight studies.\n\nThe inflight average value of 1. 31 hours is not significantly different from the\n2.2\n\nI\n\nt\nr!\n\n1. 47 hours figure seen preflight, while the value of 1.46 hours seen postflight\nis almost identical to the preflight result. Note that the first postflight night\nexhibited a relatively long REM latency, while the latter two postflight nights\nwere marked by much shorter periods.\nREM-Period Characteristics\nIn order to determine the influence of spaceflight upon the cyclical or\nperiodic nature of sleep, the temporal occurrence of REM episodes throughout\nthe night was studied. The length of each REM period was determined, and the\naverage value for the parameters was found for each preflight, inflight, and\npostflight night for which visually analyzed data was available. Similarly,\neach REM-cycle length was determined (i. e., the elapsed time between the\nonset of sleep and the onset of the first REM period and, subsequently, the\nelapsed time between the onset of one REM period and the onset of the next),\nand the average value of this measure for each night was calculated. Data\nfor the three missions is presented in Tables IV-VI.\nNo significant alterations in these parameters were seen during or following the 28-day flight (see Table IV).\nDuring the 59-day mission (Table V) and postflight, there was a small\nreduction in the average REM-period length (20. 7 minutes preflight, 16. 0\nminutes inflight, and 16. 2 minutes postflight), and several inflight daily average values fell considerably below the range seen preflight. A similar trend\nwas seen with respect to the REM-cycle length, which averaged 128. 3 minutes\npreflight, 102. 5 minutes inflight, and 73. 1 minutes postflight.\nThe 84-day mission results were similar to those of the 59-day flight in\nthat a small reduction in both the average REM period and REM-cycle length\nwas observed (Table VI). REM-period length, which averaged 31 minutes preflight, was 22. 6 minutes inflight and 20. 6 minutes postflight. The REM-cycle\nlength, averaging 108 minutes preflight, dropped to 81. 8 minutes inflight and\nwas 90 minutes postflight.\nNumber of Awakenings\nThe number of awakenings per night was calculated for the data based\nupon human visual analysis only, and this information is presented comparatively in Fig. 54.\nThe 28-day flight was characterized in the preflight period by an average\nof 19. 7 awakenings per night, with a range of 16 to 24 (Table I). The postflight\naverage was 22, with a range of 20 to 26. Although only two inflight nights are\navailable for comparison, in both instances the number of awakenings was be\n_\t\n\n23\n\nE\n\n\t\n\nthe pre- and postflight levels.\nThe number of awakenings during the preflight baseline series for the\n59-day mission .ranged from 34 to 51, with an average of 40. 7 (Table II).\ninflight a greater range was seen, extending from a low of eight on day 33\nto a high of 70 on day 9, with an average of 39. 3. Postflight the average\nnumber of awakenings dropped to 28. 5, with a range of 26 to 31. The number\nof arousals seen during the inflight portion of this mission peaked at day 9 and\ntended to decline toward baseline or sub-baseline levels as the flight progressed.\nIn the case of the 84-day mission (Table III), the number of arousals\ndeclined from a preflight average of 20.7 (20 to 21) to an inflight average\nvalue of 12, with a range of 6 to 22. Postflight, the level rose to an average\nof 18. 7, with a range of 11 to 24. Although the inflight period was characterized by considerable variation in this measure, there was no consistent trend\nnoticeable.\n\nSUBJECTIVE REPORTS\nAlthough subjective reports of sleep characteristics are often not quantitatively correct when compared to the results of objective sleep monitoring\nstudies utilizing EEG and EOG, in many instances they do reflect an accurate\nestimate of the overall quality. During Skylab, there were numerous references to sleep made by the crew members in their conversations with Mission\nControl, and these are preserved in the transcripts of spacecraft-to-ground\ncommunications. In addition, comments concerning sleep were made spontaneously and in response to specific questions during the postflight debriefing\nsessions held after each mission. During the 59- and 84-day missions, sleep\nlogs were kept by all three crewmen, in which they recorded their estimates \t\nof the quantity and quality of each night of sleep. Data gathered from these\nsources is summarized below for each mission. Although the M133 Sleep\nMonitoring Experiment was performed by the scientist-pilot only, subjective \t\nobservations made by all three crewmen are included.\n\nr\n\n{\t\n\n28 -Day Mission\n\n{\t\n\n4\n\nSubjective sleep logs were not maintained during this mission as they\nwere during the 59- and 84-day flights; in general the crew members felt\nthat sleep was adequate, and no particular problems of a long-term nature\nwere reported. All three astronauts felt that they slept less inflight than\nthey had been accustomed to on the ground, but they did not feel that the reduction in time was detrimental. ; In fact, they did not feel that they required\n24\n\nr\nR\n\n\t\n\n(I AW\n\nY\nZ\n\nmore sleep than they actually obtained. The extra time was utilized for reading\nor other personal recreation, and the eight-hour total rest period was felt to be\nbeneficial even though not always used for sleep.\nThe sleep-restraint system was considered to be quite functional, and\naccording to the CDR it was a significant improvement over the methods utilized\nin prior spacecraft.\n\nThe occasional periods of elevated temperature present in Skylab were\nconsidered to have interfered with sleep to some extent, and the sporadic noise\ngenerated by certain equipment on board occasionally resulted in brief arousals\nfrom sleep.\nThe M133 system caused no particular problems, although the SPT felt\nthat the recording cap resulted in some mild discomfort, and this may have\noccasionally influenced sleep characteristics.\n59-Day Mission\nThe crewmen were satisfied with the functioning of the sleep-restraint\nsystem and felt that it, in some respects, simulated the pressure sensations\nof 1 g. In general, they felt that sleep was better when the Skylab temperature\nwas cooler. There were complaints about the lack of soundproofing and light\nproofing in the individual sleep compartments: Sleep was difficult if one crewman was active while the others attempted to sleep.\n\nr ,..\t\n\nThe SPT commented on how pleasant it was to sleep in space, and he felt\nthat he was receiving approximately the same amount of sleep as he was accustomed to on the ground. He also commented that on the few nights when he did\nnot sleep well, or long enough, the lack of sleep seemed to affect him more the\nnext day than a comparable sleep loss would have on the ground. A similar\ncomment was made by the CDR, who noted that on the ground he might miss\nconsiderable sleep during the week and yet make it up on the weekends without its\naffecting his performance, but in space it seemed to affect him immediately\nthe next day.\nAll crewmen, in general, felt that they slept well. Falling asleep was not\na problem, and the SPT commented that he almost enjoyed waking up because he\nthen had the pleasure of returning to sleep. The Skylab equipment noises were\nsomewhat bothersome during the first few nights in space\nIt was noted that the M133 cap was more bothersome in the postflight period\ndue to the pressure on the head. The SPT felt that he lost perhaps an hour of\nsleep during the R+l study due to the discomfort.\n\n25\t\n\n}\n\na\n\nn\n\nThe SPT commented that he rarely felt as tired at the end of a day in\nspace as he might have after a comparable day on Earth. He went to bed\nbecause he felt that he needed the sleep, but he usually had the impression\nthat he could easily have stayed awake longer. The CDR, however, stated\nthat he did feel tired at the end of the day, and he had not noticed a difference\nin this aspect peculiar to spaceflight.\nThe subjective reports of sleep estimates for each day of the mission,\nas recorded in the crew logs, are presented in Table VII for all three crewmen.. Medication used during the 24 hours preceding the sleep period is also\nindicated in this table. A comparison of the objective (M133) data with the\nSPT\'s estimates is illustrated graphically in Fig. 61.\n34-Day Mission\nThe three crew members were unanimous in their opinions that sleep\nquality was greatly enhanced by the sleeping bag restraint systems. Attempts\nwere made by at least two of the astronauts (SPT and CDR) to sleep without\nrestraints on several occasions while drifting freely. Although they felt that\nthey did sleep to some extent under this condition, sleep was intermittent and\nwas not considered to be sound. The restraints apparently produced a sensation\nsomewhat similar to gravity, and this contributed to the ability to fall asleep\nand remain asleep. In addition, when drifting freely there was intermittent\ncontact with various items which apparently served as arousal stimuli.\nThe SPT reported no difficulty in operation of the M133 system and expressed the opinion that the recording cap did not interfere with his sleep. He\nfound the cap more comfortable in zero g than he had under 1 g conditions. The\nonly significant problem noted with respect to the M133 Experiment was the\nnecessity to clean excess electrolyte gel out of his hair each morning following use of the cap, a job requiring approximately .five minutes. He experienced\nsome difficulty in plugging the cap umbilical cable back into the control unit when\nit was necessary to get up during the night.\nOccasional and intermittent bouts of insomnia were reported by all three\nastronauts, especially during the first 28 days of the mission. The crew members attributed this, in part, to unusually long working hours (several 18 -hour\nworkdays) in the early days of the mission, with insufficient time in the presleep\nperiod to relax and "wind down." No specific problems were delineated, and they\nexperienced at various times difficulty in falling asleep, arousals from sleep,\nwith a prolonged time necessary to return to sleep, and early awakenings. The\nSPT apparently experienced the most-pronounced difficulty, primarily during,\nthe first 28 days; then he began to sleep fairly well, with only sporadic problems\nfor the remainder of the flight. However, he felt strongly that the problems encountered were "man made" (i. e. , due to ovexscheduling_problems), and he did\nnot feel that the zero g environment per se was a factor. Dalmane and\n\nx\n\n26\n\n1\n\npromethazine/ephedrine were occasionally utilized to promote sleep, with the\npromethazine / ephedrine providing the best subjective response.\nAll crewmen were asked to report any changes in their sleep characteristics which had occurred postflight as opposed to pre- and inflight. \t The SPT\nfelt that he had been much more conscious of dreaming postflight, and he felt\nthat he did not dream noticeably inflight. \t The CDR noted that during the first\ntwo-thirds of the mission his dreams were 1 g but changed to zero g during\nthe last third of the flight.\t The PLT did not routinely recall dreams preflight and noted no change in this characteristic either inflight or postflight.\n\n7\n\nf\n\n4\nf\n{\n\n!\n\nDuring this mission, each crew member routinely reported his own\nestimate of his sleeping quantity and quality upon arising each morning.\nThese results are presented in Table VIII for the CDR, Table IX for the\nPLT, and Table X for the SPT.\t In addition to sleeping characteristics,\neach table indicates the medication taken by each crewman over the course\nof the mission.\t The information shown in Table VIII (CDR) is summarized\ngraphically in Fig. 62, while that of Table IX (PLT) is plotted in Fig. 63.\nA similar graphic representation for the SPT (Table X and Fig. 64) also includes, for ease of comparison, the actual sleep and rest times as determined\nobjectively from the M133 data.\t It\t is\t apparent that\t in almost every instance,\non days when M133 data was available, the subject\'s estimates of total sleep\ntime corresponded closely to the subjective measure of total bed time. \t In a\nfew instances (e. g. , days 72, 77, 80, etc.), his estimate of "heavy sleep"\ncoincided with the objective measure of total sleep time, but in most cases\nthere was no correlation.\n\ny\n\nDISCUSSION\nOverview\n\n4.\n\nSleep Latency\n^i\n\nThe three Skylab flights differed with respect to sleep-latency characteristics.\nNo significant changes in this parameter were noted during the course of the 59-day\nmission.\t\n\nDuring the 28-day mission, the inflight and postflight latencies were\n\nsignificantly lower than the preflight values. \t The 84-day flight was characterized \t\nby "relatively long sleep latencies in the early portion of the flight, with a return\nto values typical of the preflight and postflight periods in the latter half of the\nmission.\t\n{\n\nThe alterations seen during the 28-day mission are apparently explainable,\nat least in part, by a difference in the subject\'s routine rather than by a direct\n27\n\nj\n\n9\n\n`!5L^ w^ r.:.,,y^lr.+.r""^"^"1\xc2\xb0+turn+.: \t\n\n_....u.^.\t\n\n...\t\n\n*^..... .. -^t..+i.Y\xe2\x80\xa2-a.^..w....,e^s.,...\t\n\n..\t\n\n_:\t\n\n..._ , _\t\n\nenvironmental influence. This individual typically spent a few minutes reading\nin bed prior to .falling asleep during the preflight studies in his own home.\nHowever, he did not continue this practice either during the flight or in the\npostflight period.\nIn only the initial portion of the 84-day mission was a degradation in sleep\nlatency seen. As illustrated in Fig. 43C, even in this case the magnitude of the\nalterations seen was not great, and on only two nights were the values outside\nthe range seen during the preflight studies. In addition, it is significant that\nthese alterations occurred in the early portion of the study and thus cannot be\nattributed to the longer duration of this mission. Consequently, it appears\nreasonable to conclude that spaceflight and the associated weightless condition\ndo not significantly interfere with the process of falling asleep, although in\nsome individuals there maybe an adaptive period during which some difficulty\nis experienced.\nSleep Time\nThe greatest overall change in total sleep time occurred during the 28day mission when a decrease of approximately one hour was seen inflight\ncompared to preflight. As indicated previously, this was a voluntary reduction in sleep time by the subject himself and thus cannot be considered as\ninsomnia. The subject did not complain of sleep loss and apparently was\nsleeping as much as he actually required. No significant changes in sleep\ntimes were noted during the 59- or 84-day mission. If the initial portion of\nthe 84-day flight is considered separately, however, it is evident that the\nsubject experienced some difficulty in sleeping during this time. Sleep was\nalso subjectively more of a problem to this individual, and he indicated on\nseveral occasions that .his sleep was not adequate. Sleeping medication was\noccasionally used by the subject, although not on the nights which were monitored.\nOf the three subjects, then, only the one studied during the 84-day flight\nexperienced real difficulty in terms of total sleep time. In this case the problem\ndiminished with time, although sleeping medication was used sporadically throughout the .flight, Regarding sleep loss in terms of any possible adverse effect upon\nperformance capability, it seems likely only during the initial period of the 84day mission. This cannot be precisely assessed because of the long sample\nintervals; however, even generalizing the worst case (4. 9 hours on day 4), a\nsevere influence upon performance would not be expected during this period.\nSleep-Stage Characteristics\nSeveral changes in sleep-stage characteristics were common to all three\nflights. Stage 3 (Fig. 50), which was significantly elevated during the inflight\nportion of the 28-day mission,- also rose inflight, though not significantly,, in\nthe 59- and 84-day flights. Postflight, the stage 3 and stage ,4 (Fig. 51) values\n28\n\n^\n\nt\n\nt^\ntF\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\ns\n\nl\n\nwere below the preflight average in all three flights, although statistical\nsignificance was achieved in only the 28- and 59-day missions. \t A consistent\nelevation of stage REM (Fig. 52) was seen in the late postflight period of all\nflights and was accompanied by a shortening of REM latency.\t In the 59- and\n84-day missions, a slight decrease in the average REM-period length and the\naverage REM-cycle length was noted inflight and postflight.\nNumber of Awakenings\n\n_\n-..\n\nAlthough this measure was highly, variable, in general the inflight period\nof all missions was characterized by no overall increases in number of arousals,\nand in the case of the 84-day mission, there weresignificantly fewer awakenings.\nSignificance of Results\nThe results obtained during the three Skylab missions suggest that prolonged spaceflight, with its accompanying weightless state, is not directly\nassociated with major adverse changes in sleep characteristics. \t The alterations\nin sleep patterns that were observed to occur were not of sufficient magnitude to\nresult in significant degradation of performance capability.\t These conclusions\nwere somewhat unsuspected, particularly in view of the pre-Skylab reports of\nsleeping difficulty that were frequently recorded during the Gemini and Apollo\nflights.\t At that time, the suspicion arose that the zero-g state might, itself,\nin some way disrupt the normal sleep-wakefulness mechanisms.\t It had been\nsuspected that the altered sensory input to the central nervous system associated with weightlessness might interfere with sleep onset, result in prolongation of the sleep-latency increase, and lead to long periods of wakefulness\nfollowing arousals from sleep.\t The Skylab results, however, show that in none\nof the missions was sleep latency a significant problem over the course of the\nflight, and in only one case (the 84-day flight) was it even a temporary difficulty.\nFurthermore, there was no evidence of consistently increased amounts of time\nspent awake during the night; in fact, the number of awakenings tended to decrease inflight.\t The results indicate that during spaceflight of long duration\nit is possible to obtain adequate amounts of sleep during regularly scheduled\neight-hour rest periods.\nThe most consistent and significant changes were actually observed in the\npostflight period of all flights, and they pertained to sleep-stage characteristics.\nThus, stages 3 and 4 tended to be decreased in the postflight period as compared\nto both pre- and inflight results\t while stage REM was elevated in the late postflight period (after day R+3) and was accompanied by a shortening of REM latency.\nThe postflight changes in stage REM are worthy of further consideration.\n-Since such findings are typical of the rebound effect seen following periods of\nrelative deprivation of stage REM, the question of a significant deprivation\ninflight arises.\t This question is, however, somewhat difficult to accurately\n29\n\n\t\n\n\xc2\xad\xc2\xad_\xc2\xad_\'_1__1__ ,\n\nrl^__ -A\n\n^!1\n\nassess. When the overall averages are considered, there appears to be no\nsignificant decrease in REM inflight. However, when the individual data\npoints are considered (Fig. 52), there is a suggestion that perhaps REM\npercent did decline in the terminal portion of the flights. This tendency is\nmost prominent in the case of the 28 -day mission, in which a relatively\nsteady decline in stage REM percent is evident after day 17. Such a trend is\nless obvious in the case of the 59-day mission, although the last two days are\nbelow the preflight average value. In the case of the 84-day flight, the latter\nportion of the mission shows only a slight indication of a decrease in stage\nREM. Even though the results appear to argue against a prior period of REM\ndeprivation inflight as a contributing factor, it must be emphasized that recordings were not made during the last two nights of each mission, and consequently this situation cannot be fully assessed.\nA shortening of REM latency was observed in the late postflight period\nof all missions and accompanied the increase in REM percent noted during\nthat time. This phenomenon has also been reported as a manifestation of a\nprior period of REM deprivation. Arguing against REM deprivation as a\ncausative agent of this change is that no lessening of the effect was evident\neven on the sixth night following recovery of the 59- and 84-day missions\nnor after the eighth night following the 28-day mission. Similarly, it seems\nunlikely that the changes in stage REM can be attributed to alterations in the\nastronauts\' sleep schedules (i. e. the advances in bedtime near the termination of each mission). It has been reported that delaying sleep periods by\nfour hours results in a shortening of REM latency, but such findings have not\nbeen reported with comparable advances in sleep onset. Furthermore, while\ndelaying sleep periods has been found to increase REM percent, advancing\nsleep periods resulted in a decrease in REM percent (Taub and Berger, 1973).\nThe data from the postflight period of the 84-day mission further suggests\nthat the increase in REM percent seen late postflight is actually a delayed\nphenomenon and follows a period of relative REM suppression in the immediate\nrecovery period. In fact, the REM percent value of 12. 1% on the first night\nfollowing recovery is well below any REM percent value seen either preflight \t\nor inflight. The value seen on day R+5 in the late postflight period is correspondingly well above any value seen eitbe\xe2\x80\x94 pre- or inflight. Delayed REM\n,\nrebound is not a typical finding in experiracntal situations involving REM\ndeprivation. It has been reported following periods of total sleep deprivation,\nin which case there is an elevation of stages 3 and 4 in the first recovery night\nand a later elevation of stage REM.. However, in none of the three Skylab flights\nwas a postflight elevation of stages 3 and 4 noted, and in fact these parameters\ntended to decline. Consequently, in these cases a delayed REM rebound appears\nq\t\npp\nY\xe2\x80\xa2\t\ny\t\nto argue against prior sleep deprivation as the cause of the postflight REM changes.\nIn view of these findings, it seems plausible that the decreased REM latency\nand increased REM percent represent a true influence of the reinstated 1-g condition and that this signifies a basic alteration in the sleep-wakefulness mechanism\n30\n\njI\n\nl^\n\n_\n\nP\t\n\nV1\n\n^^ r\n\nof the central nervous system.\n\nIt has been postulated that sleep, and in particular the REM stage,\nmay be of importance in the organization and maintenance of memory\n(Gaarder, 1966; see also reviews by Dewan, 1970, and Greenberg, 1970).\nAccording to this view, REM may be involved in consolidation or reprogramming of short-term memory into a more permanent or long-term form. If\nthis hypothesis is correct, then it might be predicted that tasks associated\nwith acquisition of new motor skills. and coordinated motor activity might be\nassociated with an increased need for stage REM sleep.\nIn support of this conclusion, Zimmerman et al. (1970) have .found that\nduring the period of adaptation to an inverted visual field, REM time was increased. Following a decline to relatively normal levels after adaptation,\nreinverting the visual field to normal was again accompanied by an increase\nin REM-sleep amount. The situation in spaceflight may be analogous, since\nthe withdrawal of gravitational cues and the decrease in proprioceptive input\nand altered vestibular input place a considerable burden upon the visual\nsystem as the sole means of maintaining spatial orientation. Following the\nmission, the return to Earth similarly required a period of adaptation to the\n1-g condition. It might be speculated, then, that the increase in REM time\nseen postflight was a manifestation of this hypothesized mechanism. There\nis no evidence in the Skylab data that adaptation to zero g is accompanied by\nan increase in REM time, and in fact the inflight values were either the same\nor lower than preflight values. However, the hypothesis cannot be adequately\nevaluated, since no sleep data was obtained prior to day 3 in any of the flights,\nand thus pertinent changes could conceivably have been missed. I.f such inflight changes were present, however, they evidently were of shorter duration\nthan those seen postflight, in which case changes were seen out to day R+B.\n\n-\t\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe objective results of these sleep monitoring experiments indicate\nthat man is able to obtain at least adequate sleep over a prolonged time in\nspace and that this can be accomplished during regularly scheduled eighthour sleep periods. The alterations in sleep patterns that were observed\nduring these missions were not of the type nor of sufficient magnitude (with\nthe possible exception of the initial portion of the 84-day mission) to result\nin significant degradation of performance capability. The most notable changes\nseen actually occurred in the postflight period, and this suggests that perhaps\nthe readaptation to 1 g is somewhat more disruptive to sleep than is the adaptation to zero g. Yet, even in this case, the alterations seen were those of sleep \t\nquality and not quantity. It is also worthy of emphasis, particularly with respect to the results seen during prior spaceflights, that none of the Skylab\n31\n\nt ..\n\nen\n\ncrewmen complained excessively of sleeping difficulties. In fact, most reported no problems with respect to sleep, and some expressed the opinion\nthat sleep was perhaps better in space. Viewed overall, these results are\nsomewhat surprising because of the frequent complaints of insomnia during\npre-Skylab missions. Apparently, the problem encountered during earlier\nspaceflights was not due simply to the imposed zero-g environment. The\nSkylab orbiting laboratory differed considerably from spacecraft of the\nApollo and Gemini types, although the gravitational and atmospheric factors\nwere the same in all cases. The working volume of the spacecraft is the\nmost likely influencing factor in terms ,of sleep. Skylab provided adequate\nroom for separate eating, exercising, working, and sleeping areas in\n12 763 ft of living area. The Apollo spacecraft measured only approximately\n3% of this volume, while the Gemini contained less than 1%. In these smaller\nspacecraft, all daily tasks were made more difficult, and the astronauts undoubtedly had a greater sense of confinement. In addition, Skylab allowed the \t\nestablishment of a daily routine which was, in most respects, directly comparable to ground-based, everyday activity. The subjects maintained their\nHouston-based time reference throughout the flight and worked during conventional hours for the most part. The individual sleeping compartments\nwere a definite improvement over the prior spacecraft systems, and undoubtedly\ninterference with sleep caused by activity of other crewmen was greatly minimized or eliminated. In general, the element of risk or danger, which is\npresent in all spaceflights, seemed to be minimized in Skylab by the presence\'\nof an established daily routine, and this also may have contributed to the improvement in sleeping conditions.\n\nti\n\nThe results also suggest areas for future study with respect to the ac-\'\nquisition of scientific data and in terms of man\'s overall adaptation to life in\nr\nspace. As indicated previously, the changes in sleep-stage characteristics \t\nr\'\nseen postflight possibly represent a direct influence of the altered gravitational \t\nfi\nfactors upon the sleep-wakefulness mechanisms. Future experiments, if\nproperly designed, could provide information of basic importance to our under-\'\nstanding of sleep. In terms of human capabilities, we feel confident that flights\nof two to three months will not be jeopardized by sleeping difficulties, but beyond this point we must continue to carefully evaluate sleep and ensure proper\nwork-rest scheduling,\n\n32\n\nREFERENCES\nrf\n\nAdey, W.

to a lesser extent it persisted in some degree\nthroughout the missions. Originally tagged \'motion sickness" by rr.edical\nobservers, it became apparent that this designation neither adequately nor\ncompletely described the phenomenon.\n\nThe most basic symptom experienced by all Skylab astronauts was the\nfsubjective sensation of head "fullness, " beginning shortly after orbital insertion and persisting throughout the mission. In some cases, this was accompanied by headache of varying intensity during the first few days in orbit. The\na\t\nhead and nasal passages seemed congested, venous distention was noted in the\nhead and neck, and a general puffiness of the face was noted. Some crewmen\nexperienced more severe symptoms, ranging from stomach awareness through\nnausea to vomiting, again confined primarily to the initial days of the flight.\nMedication, including mixtures of scopolamine and dextroamphetam,ine and a\nmixture of promethazine and ephedrine, was utilized to counteract these latter\nsymptoms. Other symptoms and signs noted by more than one astronaut inelude paresthesias in the arms and feet, decreased muscle tone, increased\ntendon reflexes, and light-.flash phenomena.\n\nt\n\n7\n\nThe postflight period was marked_ by an increase of symptomatology,\nwith vertigo or dizziness commonly precipitated by motion or standing.\nNausea sometimes was experienced, and vomiting occurred in at least one\nsubject.\n\nTwo major etiological .factors have been considered thus far; (1) altered\ninput to the vestibular system, and (2) fluid! shifts among the various body\ncompartments.\nThere is no doubt that changes did occur in the vestibular system, as \t\nrevealed by the results of the M131 Experiment. Similarly, fluid shifts\'\ndefinitely did occur, as indicated by the findings of the M092 Series. Unresolved is whether or not these findings relate causally to the major symptoms\nand if so the recise mechanism involved .\np\t\n\n}\n\n,\t\n\n\t\nk\nP\n\n\t\n\nBecause of the nature of a number of the symptoms (e. g. headache,\nnausea, paresthesias) and observations (e. g. , vomiting, altered tendon reflexes), a neurological basis for this syndrome, or portions of it, should be\nseriously considered. In particular, in view of the fluid-shift evidence, alterations of intracranial pressure, changes in cerebral hemodynamics, and\nmetabolic factors influencing brain physiology-deserve investigation.\n\nA2\n^.\t\n\n+\n\nAlthough the medical experiments performed during Skylab did not include the capability for comprehensively evaluating neurological functions, the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) was \xe2\x80\xa2recorded periodically throughout the .flights\nin the performance of the M133 Sleep Monitoring Experiment. Even though the\ndata acquisition and analysis scheme developed for sleep monitoring was not\ndesigned to provide EEG signals in the proper configuration for clinical diagnosis, it seemed worthwhile to re-evaluate the M133 data in the hope that it\nmight at least provide some additional clues or perhaps suggest future paths\nof investigation. Consequently, a preliminary review of the Skylab 2, 3, and 4\nM133 data was carried out as a pilot study, and the results thus .far are outlined below.\n\nMETHODS\n\nClinical electroencephalography is based upon interpretation of the\ngraphically displayed electrical signals obtained from electrodes affixed to\nthe scalp in precisely defined locations. Generally, a minimum of 12 recording electrodes arranged in an eight-channel montage are utilized for diagnostic\npurposes. Although EEG signals are known to occupy the frequency range from\ndo to several hundred Hz (cycles per second), clinically significant activity is\ncurrently confined to the approximate 0.5- to 40-Hz range. Activity is conventionally separated into four bands: delta activity, 0. 5-3 Hz; theta activity, 3-7\nHz; alpha activity, 8-14 Hz; and beta activity, 14-40 Hz. In a normal individual,\nspecific patterns consisting of mixtures of these frequency ranges are recorded\nfrom the various locations on the scalp. Interpretation of an electroence phaiogram consists of evaluating and quantifying the background activity and re\'7-\',)gnizing certain sporadic or intermittent wave .forms. Frequency and amplitude\npatterns vary with age, level of consciousness, and pathological conditions,\nand specific wave forms are associated with some neurological conditions.\nThe M133 data, while ideally suited for reliable and long-term determination of sleep status, was not adequate for a comprehensive clinical analysis\nthe single channel of EEG activity was derived from four electrodes (two placed\ncentrally and paired, and two placed occipitally and paired). In addition to the\nlimited spatial coverage of the head, the paired-electrode configuration prevented the detection of amplitude and frequency asymmetries between cerebral\nhemispheres.\nThe M133 protocol, designed to study the subject\'s sleep pattern, left the\nstate of consciousness and degree of alertness uncontrolled. Thus, in the presleep period when the clinical observations were attempted, the subject might\nbe moving, blinking his eyes, reading, relaxing, or drowsing. These factors\nalso degraded the quality of the clinical interpretation. In addition, in some\ninstances sleep onset occurred so rapidly after institution of the M133\n\nA3\n\nj.\t\n\nri\nExperiment that adequate waking samples were not available for evaluation.\nBecause of the above severe limitations, it was decided to confine the\ninitial analysis to one specific aspect \xe2\x80\x94 the frequency characteristics of the\nII\t\n\nalpha rhythm.\t The alpha rhythm is the most characteristic feature of the\nwaking electroencephalogram in the typical individual and tends to be stable\nover time with respect to frequency. \t In addition, it is maximally expressed\nin the occipital area and consequently is recorded well by the single M133\nchannel.\nThe alpha rhythm ranges from 8 to 12 Hz in normal adults and achieves\na maximal peak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 150 11V- \t Amplitude tends\nto wax and wane over time in the typical individual and under steady-state\nconditions.\t This activity is usually best seen when the subject is relaxed\nwith eyes closed, and it typically is suppressed by eye-opening or by mental\nactivity with eyes closed.\nIn a given normal individual, the alpha frequency usually does not change\nmore than tO. 5 Hz from one observation to the next, even over long periods.\nVarious pathological conditions may disrupt the rhythm, and many drugs given\nin toxic doses are known to lower its frequency.\nMeasurements of alpha frequency were made on each of the M133 recording nights, as well as on the pre- and postflight baseline nights and on the\ndata obtained during the preflight laboratory baseline examination.\t Frequency\n(expressed in Hz) was determined by manually counting the number of waves\noccurring over a period of time (typically ranging from I to 10 seconds) and\ndividing the total by the observation time.\t All measurements were made in\nthe presleep period immediately \'after the subject activated the M133 hardware\nand before signs of drowsiness or sleep occurred.\t Several samples (typically\neight) were measured in each presleep period, and the individual results were\naveraged to produce a single estimate of alpha frequency for that day; the variation among the individual samples constituted the range of that single estimate.\nIn addition, all values were \t when necessary\t corrected for the M133 taperecorder speed variation by utilizing the 10-Hz timing signal recorded on an\nauxiliary channel of the system.\nAlthough a study of the alpha-amplitude characteristics would also have\nbeen worthwhile, the amplitude stability of the M133 recording system was not\nconsidered to be sufficiently reliable over the course of the missions to warrent\na quantitative study.\n\nA4\n\nr\t\n\nF\n\n1t\n\nI\'\n\nRESULTS\nThe scientist pilot (SPT) of the 84-day Skylab ,flight showed a clear-cut\nand persistent elevation of his alpha frequency during the inflight and early\npostflight portions of the mission as compared to his preflight studies (Fig. Al).\nThe overall average of the four preflight studies was 9. 6 Hz, with a range of\n9. 1 to 9. 8 for the individual daily averages. Inflight, the overall average rose\nto 10. 4 Hz, with a range of 9. 7 to 10. 9 Hz. The postflight period was marked\nby a decline toward baseline from 10. 3 Hz on day R+0 to 9. 7 Hz on day R+5.\nOnly the single value for inflight day 10 (9. 7 Hz) fell within the range of averages seen preflight. When considering the range of individual samples making\nup each daily average (Fig. A2), the inflight perio%i was still clearly marked by\nvalues well outside the maximal preflight range. In .fact, no inflight individual\nsample fell as low as the average for preflight day -11.\nThe effect showed two peaks, one in the initial period of the flight and\nanother near the midportion, although this aspect was difficult to evaluate due\nto the occasionally long sample intervals. The alteration of alpha frequency\nwas evident visually when comparing samples of the recorded record obtained\nfrom the last session preflight (Fig. A3, day -11) and the first inflight recording (Fig. A4, mission day 3). Although maximal peak-to-peak amplitudes\nappeared comparable in these two tracings, the alpha activity occurred more\ncontinuously in the inflight case.\n\n,!\n\nThe data obtained from the SPT of the 59-day mission, while not as clearcut, did show several similarities to the 84-day mission. As illustrated graphi\ncally in Fig. A5, most inflight daily averages for the alpha frequency were above\nthe overall preflight average of 9.3 Hz, and the overall inflight average of 9. 5\nHz was itself elevated. Postflight, as in the case of the 84-day mission, the\nearly results were elevated, while the final value attained the preflight range.\nSince recording was not initiated until mission day 7, an early peak such as\nthat noted in the 84-day flight may have been missed.\nThe range of individual sample values comprising the daily averages is\nillustrated in Fig. A\'6, and again, though not as marked as in the 84-day mission,\nthe inflight values were often considerably above the maximal value noted in the\npreflight period.\nF\n\nThe 28-day-mission results (Fig. A7) are of limited value, since only two\ninflight recording samples were obtained. These values (average, 10. 2 Hz)\nwere both above the preflight average of 9. 9 Hz, but as indicated in Fig. A8,\nthey were within the range of individual values seen preflight. This flight also\ndiffered from the other two with respect to the postflight findings. All three\nmeasurements, obtained on days R+3, R+S, and R+7, and averaging 9. 5 Hz, \t\nwere below the preflight value of \'9. 9` Hz,\nA5\n\n.\n\nu\nl\n\nr\t\n\n)\n\nDISCUSSION\nIn all three Skylab missions, there was at least a tendency toward an\nincreased alpha frequency during the inflight portion as compared to preflight\nstudies. In two of the three flights, the early postflight period likewise was\ncharacterized by a period of increased alpha frequency, with a return toward\nbaseline seen by day R+S.\nThe alpha rhythm, recorded from the posterior scalp areas in normal\nadults, is believed to arise as a result of synaptically induced electrical activity\nin the neurons of the occipital portion of the cerebral cortex. Its hypothesized\nrole in the cerebral integration and processing of visually obtained information\nis borne out by its anatomical location in the occipital region and its reactivity\nto various visual inputs (e. g. , suppression by eye-opening and by visual imagery).\nMaintenance of the frequency stability of the rhythm is thought to be dependent\nupon an interplay between the cortical neurons originating the electrical activity\nand more-deeply lying neurons within the thalamic-projection nuclei that seem\nto pace the cortical cells. Within the thalamic nuclei, relatively random input\nfrom more-peripheral neurons is transmitted to the cortex in rhythmical bursts\ngated by an interplay of excitatory and inhibitory groups of interneurons. Ultimately, then, the frequency of the rhythm is dependent upon biochemical or\nmetabolic factors at the level of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic junctions\nwithin the thalamic neuronal network.\nAs noted above, the alpha rhythm is usually quite stable over time, and\nvariations of more than \xc2\xb10. 5 Hz are unusual. Most pathological conditions\neither lower the frequency or leave it unchanged. Thus, for example, certain\ndrugs (e. g., Dilantin) in low doses have little influence upon the alpha rhythm;\nhowever, with increasing or toxic doses, the alpha rhythm may slow in frequency by as much as 1 -2 Hz.\nConditions causing an absolute increase in the alpha frequency are quite\nrare.= It has been reported, for example, as a manifestation of nitrogen narc,os\'is (euphoria, impairment of mental processes, motor incoordination). in\ndivers exposed to elevated pressures of inspired air (Roger et al. , 1954, 1955;\nCabarrou, 1966). In these studies, it was demonstrated that the partial pressure\nof nitrogen was the critical element, and elevation of the oxygen partial pressure\nindependently did not produce the phenomenon.\nin\nTransient increases of alpha. frequency have been. reported to occur in\nassociation with various alterations of mental state. Becker-Carus (1971)\nreported an augmentation in alpha frequency while subjects performed tasks\nof relative difficulty, whereas Martinson (1939) had earlier reported similar\nobservations during mental work, both easy and difficult. Other investigators\n(Knott, 1938; Travis and Egan, 1938; Hadley, 1940, 1941) found comparable\nfrequency shifts during various other mental tasks as compared to the relaxed\nA6\n\nor resting state.\t Kamiya (1969) has reported that biofeedback techniques may\nbe successfully utilized to produce changes in alpha frequency.\n\nji\n\nji\nI\nj^\n\nWhile the possible role of such mental or psychological factors in the\nSkylab situation is difficult to assess due to the uncontrolled nature of the recording sessions, it is unlikely that these influences could produce the sustained and persistent alterations_ seen in the 84-day-mission results.\n\n:\n\nThe Skylab findings must consequently be viewed conservatively. \t In the\nabsence of the demonstration of other pathological alterations, the presence of\nan increased alpha .frequency inflight and early postflight is a nonspecific finding.\t The lack of adequate controls over the experimental situation, the limited\nscalp coverage available in this experiment, and the limited sample lengths\n-available also argue against premature conclusions concerning the influence of\nthe weightless environment upon neurological function.\nOn the other hand, despite the numerous experimental deficiencies resulting from our attempt to extract certain types of data from sources not\noriginally designed for that purpose, it does appear necessary to tentatively\nconclude that some change in brain physiology did occur concomitantly with\nthe alpha alterations.\t The conclusion that brain physiology was influenced\ninflight in turn appears to argue for a more thorough investigation of factors\n(e. g. , fluid shifts) that might conceivably elicit such alterations.\t Thus, the\nresults of this preliminary investigation of the EEG characteristics during\nSkylab appear to add some evidence in favor of the hypothesis that some of\nthe symptoms seen during the prolonged exposure to the weightless environment of orbital spaceflight may be of neurological origin.\n\n7\n\nq\t\n\n`\n\nFuture experiments utilizing EEG could be designed to further elaborate\nthis problem.\t An adequate montage, computer quantification of the entire EEG\nspectrum, and careful clinical evaluation of properly recorded preflight, inflight, and postflight data should provide conclusive evidence for or against\nthis hypothesis.\n\nREFERENCES\n3\n\nBecker-Carus, C.\t Relationships between EEG, personality and vigilance..\nElectroencephalogr.
