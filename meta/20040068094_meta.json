This meant promptly creating a very accurate Mars Polar GIs system (based on the commercial ArcView product) along with various other supporting routines. Later we extended its use to the THEMIS/VIS data. That customized GIS and integrated data system has enabled all of our polar research to date. We focused initially on a preliminary geological reconnaissance in the Ultimi Lobe region of the South Polar Layered Deposits, which also included the intended MPL landing site about which much remote sensing data and interpretations had been accumulated before the failed landing attempt on December 3, 1999. The most interesting findings from that effort were discoveries about the layering, faulting and contact relationships exposed along the bounding scarp. Those results were published in Icarus. We have had a priority interest in the cratering record of the polar layered deposits, starting with the first post-Viking survey based on MOLA shaded relief maps and crossing profiles. Those results, based primarily on craters < 1 km diameter, were published in JGR and showed that a portion of the SPLD exhibited a large crater population consistent with an exposure age of 30 million years or more. Those craters also exhibited remarkably low Depth to Diameter ratios, which Asmin Pathare, then at UCLA, subsequently interpreted as due to slow viscous flow in the ice-rich material composing the PLD. Our cratering study also recognized that the craters of less than 1 km diameter were many order of magnitudes too few compared to what the crater production function of the larger craters requires.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040068094, "id": "ee033f9d1e8a4b45b7f93c24873fa41b", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
