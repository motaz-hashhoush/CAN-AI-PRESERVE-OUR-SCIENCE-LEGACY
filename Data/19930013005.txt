Images obtained with these probes\nreveal both the surface topography and the magnetic structure. We have made a thorough theoretical analysis of the\ninteraction between the probe and the magnetic fields emanating from a typical recorded surface. Quantitative\ndata\nabout the constituent magnetic fields can then be obtained. We have employed these techniques in studies of two of\nthe most important issues of magnetic recording:\ndata overwrite and maximizing\ndata-density.\nThese studies have\nshown: (i) Overwritten\ndata can be retrieved under certain conditions,\nand (ii) Improvements\nin data-density\nwill\nrequire new magnetic materials. In the course of these studies we have developed\nnew techniques\nto analyze the\nmagnetic fields of recorded media. These studies are both theoretical and experimental\nand combined with the use of\nour magnetic force scanning tunneling microscope\nshould lead to further breakthroughs\nin the field of magnetic\nrecording.\nINTRODUCTION\nThis paper updates and summarizes\nthe work that we have performed\n[refs. 1-7] in developing\na magnetic\nforce scanning tunneling microscope.\nWe have developed this device as a tool to study important questions in the\nrapidly evolving field of magnetic recording.\nTwo of the questions that we have addressed are: (1) What happens\nwhen data on magnetic media is overwritten\nwith new data? and; (2) What are the limits of data-density\n(the amount\nof data that can be recorded in a given area) in magnetic recording? Ideally, one might hope that the answer to the\nfirst question is: When old data is overwritten\nwith new data, the old data is completely erased and only the new data\nis present. If the real world is less than the ideal, then new questions are posed: Under what conditions\ncan the old\ndata be retrieved?\nHow much can be retrieved? Do different types of data respond differently? What can one do to\ninsure complete erasure? Is the new data corrupted in any way by the overwrite process? In our studies we have tried\nto address all of these questions. The most important discovery of our work is that under certain conditions all of the\noverwritten data can be retrieved.\nFor the question of data density, we have demonstrated\nthat there are limits to the density that can be\nobtained with present day materials. This then leads to the question: What are the important parameters\nthat can be\nchanged to increase the data density? This is the most important question in magnetic recording technology and it has\nbeen discussed extensively\nin the literature. What we have demonstrated\nwith our studies is how the magnetic force\nscanning tunneling microscope\ncan be used to study the processes\nthat limit the data density and how the new\ntheoretical studies that we have developed will lead to an improved understanding\nof these processes.\nTECHNIQUE\nRice and Moreland\n[8] have shown that magnetic data on a hard disk can be imaged with a tunneling\nmicroscope\nby using a flexible triangular probe cut from a thin film of magnetic material. We have assembled a\nsimilar device [1]. This technique is a straightforward\nand useful extension of scanning tunneling microscopy\n(STM)\n[9]. In this new technique, a flexible magnetic probe is used in place of the fine metallic tip employed\nin STM for\nimaging of surface topography.\nThe magnetic probe is deflected as it interacts with the local magnetic fields. The\ndeflections\nchange the tunneling gap (the probe-sample\nseparation),\nwhich correspondingly\nchange the tunneling\ncurrent. A feedback system continuously\nadjusts the vertical displacement\nof the probe to keep the current constant as\nit is rastered across the surface. The changes in the vertical displacement\nare measured and recorded 400 times on a\nsingle scan. The image is constructed\nfrom 400 rastered scans. Thus, as schematically\nshown in Fig. l(a), the\n\n429\n\n_\n\nMeasured\n\ntmage,\n\nAz(x,y)\n\nMeasured\n\ncorrugation,\n\n/_\n\nSurface\n\n_ u "1\n\ntopology,\n\ny\n\nAs\n\nMagnetization\npattern\n\n(a)\n\nx\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1.

The vertical displacements,\nand the in-plane rastering position are all controlled and measured\nby accurate piezoelectric\nelements.\nA typical image is shown in Fig. 2. The image shows magnetically\nrecorded data on a commercial\nhard\ndisk. Three distinct data tracts are visible here, each having a width of approximately\n45 It. The tracks are separated\nby about 12 IXof non magnetized\nregion. Magnetized\nregions appear as broad (~ 6 IX) depressions\nbounded\nby\nrelatively narrow ( ~ 2 Ix) bright protrusions.\nThe "height" of these magnetized\nregions are of the order of 150-200\nnm, which is roughly a factor of 10 larger than the surface roughness. The surface roughness shows up as the fine\nlines running perpendicular\nto the magnetic data. These fine lines are caused by the final machining of the aluminum\ndisks. The disks appear mirror-smooth\nto the naked eye and the fine lines, which are readily apparent here, can only\nbe observed with the most sophisticated\noptical microscopes.\nIn Fig. 2(b), we show a high-resolution\nmagnification\nroughly corresponding\nto the upper right-hand corner of the image. Two different types of tracks are clearly visible,\ndistinguished\nby the change in relative sizes of depressions\nand protrusions;\nwhich demonstrates\nthe ability of our\ndevice to distinguish\nbetween different directions of surface magnetization.\nThe 3D image shown in Fig. 2(b) was\nconstructed\nthrough system software. The variations in the amplitude of the displacements\ncan be seen along the\nlower edge of the image in Fig. 2(b). To obtain quantitative\ninformation\nabout the magnetic fields emanating from\nthe surface, one would have to know how the displacement\namplitude is related to the magnetic fields. In order to\nobtain this information,\nwe have made a complete theoretical\nanalysis [2] of the interaction\nbetween a flexible\ntriangular\nprobe and a typical magnetic\npattern on a recorded\nsurface. The use of this analysis\nallows the\nmeasurement\nof the magnetic\nfields of the recorded\npatterns imaged by a magnetic\nforce scanning\ntunneling\nmicroscope.\nTHEORY\nM_lgneti_ Figlds\nFig. l(b) shows the geometry for our calculations.\nWe assume\nsymmetric pattern of wavelength\nX in the x direction, with infinite extent\nfrom the pattern can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential _,\n\nthat the recorded\nin the y direction.\n\nsignal is a repetitive,\nThe magnetic field H\n\nH = -VO\nThe scalar potential\n\nwill be the solution\n\nof Laplace\'s\n\nequation\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 (x,z ) = _.e\n\n( 1)\n\nand can be written as,\n\n-_ coskx,\n\n(2)\n\nn=|\n\nwhere k = 2_n/_,\n\nand the coefficients\n\nOA match the series solution\n\nto the particular\n\nfield pattern.\n\nThe field pattern\n\nwill of course depend on the magnetization\ndistribution\nwithin the recorded media. We have found it convenient\nto\nexpress the magnetization\nin Fourier series. If we assume that the recording media is so thin that the magnetization\nis uniform through the thickness of the t\'tim, then there are two different magnetization\npatterns that will lead to the\nscalar potential given by (2).

We have used (5) to construct numerous\nfield distributions,\nincluding all the ones we could find in the literature [10], [11], [12]. The point is that we can use these techniques to\nfind the magnetic fields from virtually any distribution\nof magnetization.\nWe now return to the major problem at\nhand: the interaction between these fields and the probe tip.\nEnergy of Interaction\n\nexpressed\n\nThe Energy\nas [113]\n\nof interaction\n\nbetween\n\nthe field from the pattern and the last domain\n\nE=-fHiM\n\non the probe tip can be\n\n(6)\n\ndV,\n\nwhere M is the magnetization\n\nof the last domain on the probe tip, and V is the volume of the domain. To perform\nthe integral of (6) we make the following assumptions:\n(i) the domain is magnetized\nalong the probe axis by shape\nanisotropy,\n(ii) the domain is much longer than k so that the limit of integration\nin the z direction can be extended\nto infinity, and (iii) the thickness of the probe, t, is much less than the wavelength\n_.. Rugar et al. [12] have shown\nthat the last domain on their probe tip was about 20 IX in length, and since most patterns on modern recording\nsurfaces have a wavelength\nsmaller than this, assumption\n(ii) is not unreasonable.\nThe thickness\nof the probe is\nmuch less than a micron which is about the smallest wavelength\ncurrently available. Using these assumptions,\nthe\nintegral (6) was evaluated in [2] with the result,\n\n"\nf\nE : Mtw_-" O.e-n_coskx\n[\n\nsm((kwsm"" _)/2)\n(kwsin\n\nt_.,_.\n+ "--:-_\'- [A+ cosk(x\nwr\n\n\xc2\xa2) / 2\n\n- x+)+ A_cosk(x-\n\n"l\nx_)]f.\n\n(7)\n\nwhere,\n\nA_ = 1 / _/cos 20 + (sin 0cos\xc2\xa2 + tan tSsin \xc2\xa2)2,\n\n(8)\n\nand,\n_ w\n\n. _ . 1_\n\n__(sin0cos\xc2\xa2_+\n\nt,\n\ntantSsin\xc2\xa2\'_\n\n7o o\n\n(9)\n\nJ\n\nThe integrals were performed so that the point (x,z) is the coordinate of the probe tip. The first term in (7) is due to a\nmagnetic charge Mtw at the tip of the probe. The magnetic potential is weighted by a sampling factor caused by the\nvariation in the field across the width w of the probe tip. The next two terms can be thought of as the contributions\nfrom the magnetic\ngive a complete\nProbe-Tip\n\ncharges\n\nexpression\n\non the sides of the probe, separated\nfor the energy of interaction\n\nfrom the tip by the distances\n\nbetween\n\nx\xc2\xb1.

In\ngeneral, the equations are quite complicated and their usefulness is not readily apparent. In the case when the probe\nlines up with the pattern (g}= 0) the equations reduce to a simple form,\n\nAz =\n\n_\n\n[H x cos 0 + H, sin 0 + 2\n\n,dx\'\n\n]\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nThe first two terms give the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic charge at the tip. The next term\ngives the effect of the charges on the sides of the probe. This last term was written in the integral form so that it\ncould be expressed in terms of the magnetic field Hz. It could have been written in terms of H x in which case it\nwould have been identical to the expression for the flux picked up by a conventional recording head. Equation (15)\nis an important result because it shows that, if the third term can be made small, then the images can be related to\nthe magnetic fields at a point. We call this "the point charge model" and we have expanded on it in [6] and [7].\nEquation\n\n(15) can be used to obtain relative values of the magnetic field components Hx and Hz. To obtain\n\nabsolute values, the probe would have to be calibrated in a known field to obtain the factor 12Mtw/K. One way to\nobtain the fields from (15) is to obtain three images at three different values of the angle 0. The fields H x and Hz\ncan then be obtained at every point from a linear combination of the three images. For example, if three images,\nAz(0), were obtained at the angles of 30, 45, and 60 degrees, then Hx and H z could be solved for, to obtain,\n\nH,, - 12MtwK [18.02Az(30\xc2\xb0)_\n\nH, -\n\n2K\n[23.48Az(30\xc2\xb0)-29\nl Mtw t\nx\n/\n\n29.35Az(45.)+\n\n13.56Az(600)],\n\n35Az(45\xc2\xb0)+10.40Az(60\xc2\xb0)]\n"\n_\nj\n\n434\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nSince all the data used to construct the images is available in digital form, it is a simple matter to combine the\nimages using (16)-(17) to obtain the magnetic fields. The main experimental\ndifficulty with this procedure would be\nin obtaining the images at exactly the same location every time. One way to alleviate this problem would be to use\nthe topological features of the surface as guide-points.\nWe have thus made a complete theoretical analysis of how the\nmagnetic force scanning tunneling microscope\ncan be used to obtain the magnetic fields from recorded media as a\nfunction of all of the relevant parameters.\nDATA\n\nOVERWRITE\n\nOverwrite performance\nis a major concern in magnetic recording since data detection can be corrupted by\npreviously\nrecorded patterns when sufficient overwrite\nis not achieved. Even with direct overwrite,\nportions of\npreviously recorded data can persist and be detectable. Tracking misregistration,\nor slight deviations in positioning of\nthe recording\nhead from the original track, could leave even more significant\nportions of previous data along the\ntrack edge [3]. Fig. 3(a) shows a 501_x50tt image of a commercial\nrigid disk with overwritten\ndata. The new data\nappears as the long alternating bright protrusions\nand dark depressions\nrepresenting\noppositely magnetized\nregions\nalong the track. Remnants of the previously recorded data appear as localized regions extending by a few microns\nfrom the upper track edge. It should be emphasized\nthat this pattern was not deliberately\nconstructed\nbut was found\non a previously used disk. The overwritten\ndata can be completely recovered by simply reading it off on a bit-by-bit\nbasis.\nThe high resolution\nimage of a different\noverwritten\nregion in fig. 3(b) suggests\nsome interesting\ncharacteristics\nof the erase band. the regions where the old and new data coincide create continuous\nmagnetization\nbetween the old and new tracks, as exhibited\nby the extreme left transition.\nThis is not the case for the two\nsucceeding transitions, however, where the new set is out-of-phase\nwith the old set. Here, the old data are truncated\nprior to the emergence\nof the new data, leaving about a micron wide gap with no definite magnetization.\nThis\nbehavior is consistent\nwith current notions of the erase band [13,14]. The write field within this narrow band was\nabove the coercivity of the media to reduce the magnetization\nat those areas (which truncated the bright stripes of the\nold data) but the magnitude was not high enough to create new well defined magnetizations.\nWe have continued these investigations\nby obtaining images of deliberately overwritten\ndata on thin film disk\nmedia. We have examined the relationship\nbetween the persistence of overwritten\ndata and the radial offset of the\nrecording head, as well as the effects of the recording density [5]. The effect of a previously recorded pattern can be\ndetected even when distinct remnant transitions can not be identified.\nAt recording frequencies\nin the range of 10\nMHz, the previously\nrecorded pattern affects the newly recorded track even at small (>21-0 offsets, by introducing\napparent lengthening\nor shortening of the track-width\ndepending upon the relative phases of old and new patterns.\nPresumably,\none could still extract the overwritten\ndata in this case but it would require much more analysis.\nDistinct portions of overwritten\ndata remain on the surface for offsets in excess of 2 IX.At low recording frequencies\nin the range of 1 MHz, larger offsets (>4IX) are needed to detect previously\nrecorded data. In this case, the nonuniform magnetization\nintroduces recorded cells of "trapezoidal" cross sectional area. This effect is less severe at high\nfrequencies, and plays a crucial role in extending the required minimum offset.\nDATA\n\nDENSITY\n\nDespite recent advances in media processing technology and the demonstration\nof storage densities beyond 1\nGigabit/square\ninch [14], our understanding\nof processes that lead to reduction in signal strength as the wavelength\nis\ndecreased is still under development.\nThe process involves a complex interplay between media and recording head\nproperties.\nWhile a great deal of theoretical\nand experimental\nwork has been performed,\none of the difficulties\nin\ndetermining\nthe roles played by the different mechanisms\nis the lack of systematic experimental\ndata to characterize\nmagnetization\npatterns with sufficient spacial resolution.\nWhat we have done is to show how the magnetic force\nscanning tunneling microscope\n(MFSTM) can be used as a powerful tool to study this problem.\nIn this work, we are concerned with direct real space imaging of recorded patterns. We performed a series of\nMFSTM measurements\nof magnetization\npatterns which were written with progressively\nincreasing densities.\nWe\nthen analyzed\nthe pattern behavior\nas the wavelength\nwas reduced.\nThis work extends previously\nreported\ninvestigations\nof high density recording on longitudinal\nrecording media by using magnetic force microscopy\n[ 13].\nIn contrast with those MFM measurements,\nthe current MFSTM based technique allows a more straightforward\ninterpretation\nof the images and thus facilitates quantitative\nanalysis. Specifically,\nwe make quantitative\nestimates of\nthe transition length by comparing image profiles with calculated lineshapes based upon an arctangent model for the\ntransitions.\nWe then discuss possible mechanisms\nthat play major roles in causing self-erasure\nat high recording\ndensities.\n\n435\n\nMeasurements were made on a commercially available rigid disk with patterns recorded on a precision spin\nstand system. Fig. 4 shows a series of recorded transitions in the range of 100 to 2000 FR/mm, which correspond to\nrecorded wavelengths\nX in the range from 20 I_ to 1 It. All images were obtained using a single imaging probe so\nthat comparisons between different tracks are independent of probe specific prope_es.\nIn addition to trackwidth reduction [16], we find significant\nincreasing density. In the range from 100 to 600 FR/mm (201./_\n\nvariations in the behavior of these patterns with\n)_ < 3.1/z ), the transitions are well defined and\n\nexhibit very little zigzag across the track. This is consistent with previously reported magnetic force microscope\nmeasurements\non longitudinal recorded patterns [13]. Similarly, the amplitudes of the magnetic features are more or\nless constant, indicating that the relative swength of the fields do not vary significantly from the longest wavelength\ndown to about 3.1 _t. At higher densities, the amplitudes decrease sharply and the patterns gradually lose their detail.\nThe transitions start to become fuzzy, and in certain areas, they appear to merge together. The bits coalesce to form\nlocalized patches, becoming more noticeable for _.<2.21.t. At 1 _t wavelength,\nthe track edges become indistinct and\nthe size of the coalesced regions has increased considerably,\nleaving individual transitions barely discernible. This\neffect could be associated with either poor high density performance of the media or the frequency response of the\nrecording head. It is quite possible that recording fields perturb neighboring previously recorded bits, which reduces\ntheir magnetizations.\nDiscussion\nWe begin our analysis by deriving an estimate of the transition length.\nFig. 4 show that the lineshapes\nvary with the wavelength.\nThis is illustrated\naverage line profiles from representative\nimages in Fig. 4 are presented as solid\nthe left transition edge at the lowest recording frequency,\nand gradually moves\ndecreased. This can be explained using a model that allows the transition length\nfraction of the bit length.\n\nClose inspection\nof the images in\nclearly in Fig. 5 where a series of\ncurves. The peak occurs very near\nto the center as the wavelength\nis\nparameter\nto become a substantial\n\nAs shown previously, the deflection Az is given by (15). For the probe that we used, 8=15 degrees and\nw=2.51.t. To use (15), expressions\nmust he found for the magnetic field caused by the recorded magnetization.\nFor\nthis study we will assume that the magnetization\nis a symmetric\nseries of alternating\npolarities\nwith arctangent\ntransitions. The Fourier series that approximates\nthe magnetization\npattern is given by\n,.,\nM_ = 8M,\n\n_\n\ne-la\n.\n_slnkx\n\n(18)\n\nwhere a is the transition length. Strictly speaking, this series represents the arctangent transitions only in the limit\nwhere ,_. >> 4a. We have found, however, that (18) gives a useful (if not exact) fit to the data even when this\nlimit is not satisfied.\n\nThis series underestimates\n\nthe peak magnetization\n\nas the transitions\n\nare brought\n\nclose together\n\nbut has the property of eliminating\nthe sharp junctions\nat x = n_l. [ 4, for n odd, which appear by directly\nmatching arctangent transitions. We computed the fields by using (1), (2), (5), and (18), and then substituting\nthem\ninto (15) to obtain lineshape profiles. The lineshapes were then fit to the experimental data using a as an adjustable\nparameter.\nThe resulting\ncurves are shown as dashed lines in Fig. (5). We find that the best fit to the data\ncorresponds\nto a transition of a=0.71a. The best fit was obtained at the longest wavelength,\nwhere this theory would\nbe most applicable.\nIt should be emphasized\nthat we attempted to fit the experimental\ndata to numerous magnetization\ndistributions, but the arctan distribution\ngave the best results. This is not surprising since the arctan distribution\nis\nthe most widely accepted distribution\nseen in the literature. What actually happens, however, when the transitions\nare brought close together, might, according to our calculations,\nbe somewhat surprising.\nIt is commonly\naccepted\nthat data density is limited by the increasing demagnetizing\nfields caused by the transitions\nbeing brought close\ntogether. Our calculations show, however, that the demagnetizing\nfields decrease\nas the transitions are brought close\ntogether. This is caused by the long tails of the arctan transitions which have the effect of drastically\nreducing the\nmagnetization,\nand hence the demagnetizing\nfields, as the transitions are brought close together. It is this breakdown\nin the magnetization\npatterns that leads to the limits in data density. The usual arguments\nabout increasing\nthe\ncoercivity\nto increase data density are still valid, because these arguments\nare made on the basis of isolated\ntransitions. To increase data density you have to decrease the transition length. The transition length can only be\ndecreased by increasing the coercivity, or the squareness of the hysterisis loop.

These\nconclusions\nare not new, but have been known for a long time [17], [18]. What is new is the actual observation\nof\nwhat is happening as the data density is increased. We have demonstrated\nthat the magnetic force scanning tunneling\nmicroscope can be used as a powerful tool in studying these problems.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe MFSTM\nis shown to be a powerful\ntechnique for generating\nimages of magnetization\npatterns.\nIn\nparticular, it has been used to yield images of persisting remanent data with minute details, and to investigate subtle\nfeatures of overwritten\ndata. We have demonstrated\nthat the MFSTM is a powerful\ntool, useful in obtaining\nqualitative images and in deriving quantitative\nresults. We used the technique in a study of data density and showed\nthat the measured profiles could be adequately described by a model of arctan transitions. The best fit to the data gave\na transition\nlength of a=0.7_t. Our theoretical\nanalysis shows how the constituent\nmagnetic fields from recorded\nmagnetic patterns can be obtained from the images. We also show how the sensitivity of the microscope\nvaries with\nthe orientation of the probe, and how this relates to experimental\ndata.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe are grateful to Mr. John Gorczyca and Dr. Mark Kryder at Carnegie Mellon University,\nData Storage\nSystems Center for their cooperation\nand for providing recorded disks used in these experiments.\nMr. Gorczyca and\nDr. Kryder were also co-authors of two of our publications [4],[5].\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
