Introduction\nThe IAA Correlator Center is located at and sta\xef\xac\x80ed by the Institute of Applied Astronomy in\nSt. Petersburg, Russia.\nThe IAA Correlator Center is devoted to processing geodetic, astrometric, and astrophysical\nobservations made with the Russian national VLBI network Quasar.\n\nFigure 1.

Component Description\nThe ARC (Astrometric Radiointerferometric Correlator) (Figure 1) was the main data processing device in the IAA Correlator Center in 2012. The ARC was designed and built in the IAA\nRAS in 2007 - 2009. The correlator has an XF design and is based on FPGA technology.\nThe ARC is a six-station, 15-baseline correlator. It is able to process up to 16 frequency\nchannels on each baseline, for a total of 240 channels. The correlator accesses two-bit VLBI\nsignals with 32 MHz maximal clock frequency. The maximal data range from each station is\n1 Gbit per second. The correlator requires VSI-H input VLBI signals, and it is equipped with\nMark 5B playback terminals.\nSince 2011 the DiFX software correlator has been used in some astrophysical experiments. The\nDiFX is installed at the IAA on a Sun Fire X4450 Server as a virtual machine under the VMware.\n\n3.

Current Status and Activities\nThe ARC correlator was used for processing all of the national geodetic VLBI observations in\nthe IAA Correlator Center in 2012. The RUE and RUU geodetic VLBI sessions were observed in\nIAA RAS.\nThe three-station 24-hour RUE sessions for EOP determination were observed one time per\nweek, as in 2011.\nThe two-station one-hour sessions for UT1-UTC determination in e-VLBI mode were carried\nout one time per week up to June 2012 and one time per day starting in July 2012. The RUU\nsessions were executed on cold station receivers, with a frequency channel bandwidth of 8 MHz\nand a total bitrate of 256 Mbps, and on warm receivers, with a frequency channel bandwidth of\n16 MHz and a total bitrate of 512 Mbps. The data transfer speed from station to correlator was\nimproved in 2012, and near to realtime correlation processing with a data bitrate of 256 Mbps was\nachieved.\nIn 2012, the DiFX software correlator became the main tool for a spectral radio source observation processing routine. We have started regular observing program Ru-P in 1.35 cm band and\n202\n\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\nIAA RAS\n\nIAA Correlator Center\n\n18 cm band. Target sources are Orion KL, W49N, W3OH, and W75, and the experiment bitrate\nis 32 Mbps. The processing time for one second of real data is about eight seconds with DiFX\nusing current facilities on a Sun Fire X4450 Server and its virtual machines under the VMware.\nThe output data has a resolution from 1024 to 4096 spectral channels. Several experiments were\nobserved with station Simeiz: RU0069, RU0083, RU0084, RU0087, and RU0088. These were 1.35\ncm band sessions. Data from the Simeiz station were transferred via Internet directly to IAA\xe2\x80\x99s\nserver, then processed with DiFX. We also used DiFX in test experiments of a new wideband DAS:\na single IF channel of 512 MHz width with 2 Gbps total bitrate was successfully processed using\nDiFX.\n\n5. Future Plans\nThe design of a new FX software correlator intended for the new small antenna VLBI network\nin comformance with VLBI2010 was started in 2012 at IAA RAS. The correlator design is supposed\nto process up to 16 Gb/s data stream from each of up to six observatories. VLBI data are recorded\nfrom four frequency bands with bandwidth up to 1024 MHz in one circular polarization or up to\n512 MHz in two linear polarizations using 2-bit sampling. The input data format is VDIF. The\ncorrelator computes cross-spectra with a resolution up to 4096 spectral channels, and it extracts\nup to 16 phase calibration tones in each frequency band of each station. The correlator\xe2\x80\x99s hardware\nis based on hybrid blade server technology. Blade server contains two Intel CPU and two Nvidia\nTesla GPUs. All critical computing such as Fourier transform, spectra multiplication and addition,\nand phase cal extraction will be perfomed using GPU; other tasks (data stream synchronization\nand distribution) will be provided by CPU. By a preliminary estimate, the hardware will contain\nup to 20 blade servers.\n\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\n203\n\n'
