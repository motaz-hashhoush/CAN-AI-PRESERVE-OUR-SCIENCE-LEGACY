From a recent 20th century atmospheric reanalysis (1,2) winters with more frequent blocking persist over several decades and correspond to a warm North Atlantic Ocean, in-phase with Atlantic multi-decadal ocean variability (AMV). Ocean circulation is forced by wind-stress curl and related air/sea heat exchange, and we find that their space-time structure is associated with dominant blocking patterns: weaker ocean gyres and weaker heat exchange contribute to the warm phase of AMV. Increased blocking activity extending from Greenland to British Isles is evident when winter blocking days of the cold years (1900-1929) are subtracted from those of the warm years (1939-1968).", "title": "Atmospheric Blocking and Atlantic Multi-Decadal Ocean Variability", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-25T09:06:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20110008410, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hakkinen, Sirpa"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "4e1f8086270e439db97ef767c7340f20"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20110008410, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rhines, Peter B."}, "organization": {"name": "Washington Univ.", "location": "Seattle, WA, United States"}}, "id": "02304e9abbf34cfebd199dbb252854a8"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20110008410, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Worthen, Denise L."}, "organization": {"name": "Wyle Integrated Science and Engineering Group", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "d36b6f8a5a4742ed8ca354b8c4b1bc98"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20110008410, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110008410, "id": "38ce790eb01647e2b1a22eeb384791ae", "publicationDate": "2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110008410.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110008410/downloads/20110008410.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110008410/downloads/20110008410.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110008410/downloads/20110008410.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
