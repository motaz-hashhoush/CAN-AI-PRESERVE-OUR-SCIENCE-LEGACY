The event was associated with the Seyfert galaxy 1ES 1927+654, a \"True Type-2\" that, nevertheless, showed an X-ray spectrum typical of an unobscured Type 1 AGN. Optical monitoring revealed the emergence of broad Balmer emission lines following the outburst, suggesting a transition from a Type 2 to a Type 1 AGN on timescales consistent with the light-travel time between the central black hole and the broad line region. The optical outburst was followed by a dramatic shift in the X-ray spectrum as the hard X-ray luminosity of the corona plunged by >2 orders of magnitude and the spectrum became dominated by a 10^6 K thermal component. The subsequent X-ray evolution of 1ES 1927+654 includes an additional two-order of magnitude decline in overall luminosity, followed by an extended period of quiescence, and re-brightening to levels that make it the brightest AGN currently in the X-ray sky. Throughout its evolution, the source has displayed X-ray flux variability of factors of several on timescales less than hour, and of ~100 on timescales less than a day. The X-ray spectrum varies along a consistent luminosity-dependent track, wherein increases in flux are accompanied by a spectral hardening. We seem to be witnessing the onset of an instability in the pre-existing AGN disc and corona, followed by a still-continuing re-emergence of the corona. If the initial transient is identified as the tidal disruption of a star, it is possible that this was the instigator of this unique behavior.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190034097, "endDate": "2019-11-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Maryland Univ.", "location": "College Park, MD, United States"}}, "meetingId": "461731d7e8114717bf1354d51e47bc38", "id": "6feae2e17ce246f4b6d8c707c234dbb8"}], "name": "The New Faces of Black Holes", "location": "Annaplois, MD", "id": "461731d7e8114717bf1354d51e47bc38", "startDate": "2019-11-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190034097, "id": "1b2e2d7450f54987b646af923c070a1a", "publicationDate": "2019-11-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190034097.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190034097/downloads/20190034097.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190034097/downloads/20190034097.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190034097/downloads/20190034097.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
