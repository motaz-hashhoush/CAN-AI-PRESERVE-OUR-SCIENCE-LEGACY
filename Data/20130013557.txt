b'Information Technology\nMixed Integer Programming and Heuristic Scheduling for\nSpace Communication\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nOptimal planning and scheduling for\na communication network was created\nwhere the nodes within the network are\ncommunicating at the highest possible\nrates while meeting the mission requirements and operational constraints. The\nplanning and scheduling problem was\nformulated in the framework of Mixed\nInteger Programming (MIP) to introduce a special penalty function to convert the MIP problem into a continuous\noptimization problem, and to solve the\nconstrained optimization problem\nusing heuristic optimization.\nThe communication network consists\nof space and ground assets with the link\ndynamics between any two assets varying\nwith respect to time, distance, and telecom configurations. One asset could be\n\ncommunicating with another at very\nhigh data rates at one time, and at other\ntimes, communication is impossible, as\nthe asset could be inaccessible from the\nnetwork due to planetary occultation.\nBased on the network\xe2\x80\x99s geometric dynamics and link capabilities, the start\ntime, end time, and link configuration\nof each view period are selected to maximize the communication efficiency\nwithin the network.\nMathematical formulations for the\nconstrained mixed integer optimization\nproblem were derived, and efficient analytical and numerical techniques were\ndeveloped to find the optimal solution.\nBy setting up the problem using MIP, the\nsearch space for the optimization problem is reduced significantly, thereby\n\nspeeding up the solution process. The\nratio of the dimension of the traditional\nmethod over the proposed formulation\nis approximately an order N (single) to\n2*N (arraying), where N is the number\nof receiving antennas of a node. By introducing a special penalty function, the\nMIP problem with non-differentiable\ncost function and nonlinear constraints\ncan be converted into a continuous variable problem, whose solution is possible.\nThis work was done by Charles H.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nVideo-based altimetric and obstructiondetection systems for aircraft have been\npartially developed. The hardware of a system of this type includes a downward-looking video camera, a video digitizer, a\nGlobal Positioning System receiver or\nother means of measuring the aircraft velocity relative to the ground, a gyroscopebased or other attitude-determination subsystem, and a computer running altimetric\nand/or obstruction-detection software.\nFrom the digitized video data, the altimetric software computes the pixel ve-\n\nlocity in an appropriate part of the\nvideo image and the corresponding angular relative motion of the ground\nwithin the field of view of the camera.\nThen by use of trigonometric relationships among the aircraft velocity, the attitude of the camera, the angular relative motion, and the altitude, the\nsoftware computes the altitude. The obstruction-detection software performs\nsomewhat similar calculations as part of\na larger task in which it uses the pixelvelocity data from the entire video\n\nimage to compute a depth map, which\ncan be correlated with a terrain map,\nshowing locations of potential obstructions. The depth map can be used as\nreal-time hazard display and/or to update an obstruction database.\nThis work was done by Frank J. Delgado of\nJohnson Space Center and Michael F.

Piezo\nstepping actuators are novel because\nthey offer extreme dynamic range (cen-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, May 2013\n\ntimeter stroke with nanometer resolution) with power, thermal, mass, and\nvolume advantages over existing motorized actuation technology. These advantages come with the added benefit of\n\ngreatly reduced complexity in the support electronics. The piezo stepping actuator consists of three fully redundant\nsets of piezoelectric transducers (PZTs),\ntwo sets of brake PZTs, and one set of\n\n25\n\nextension PZTs. These PZTs are used to\ngrasp and move a runner attached to\nthe optic to be moved. By proper cycling of the two brake and extension\nPZTs, both forward and backward\nmoves of the runner can be achieved.\nEach brake can be configured for either\na power-on or power-off state. For SIM,\nthe brakes and gate of the mechanism\nare configured in such a manner that, at\nthe end of the step, the actuator is in a\nparked or power-off state.\nThe control software uses asynchronous sampling of an optical encoder to\nmonitor the position of the runner.\n\n26\n\nThese samples are timed to coincide\nwith the end of the previous move,\nwhich may consist of a variable number\nof steps. This sampling technique linearizes the device by avoiding input saturation of the actuator and makes latencies of the plant vanish. The\nsoftware also estimates, in real time, the\nscale factor of the device and a disturbance caused by cycling of the brakes.\nThese estimates are used to actively cancel the brake disturbance. The control\nsystem also includes feedback and feedforward elements that regulate the position of the runner to a given reference\n\nposition. Convergence time for smalland medium-sized reference positions\n(<200 microns) to within 10 nanometers can be achieved in under 10 seconds. Convergence times for large\nmoves (>1 millimeter) are limited by\nthe step rate.\nThis work was done by Joel F.
