A radio spectrum surveillance capability at these stations is needed to determine the sources of interference so that preventative measures can be taken. The first phase of a program to develop this capability was the development of a low-cost surveillance station now in operation at the Goldstone Space Communication Complex near Barstow, California. This interim surveillance station is described and findings from the use of this equipment are presented.", "title": "Interim radio spectrum surveillance station", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T19:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19790022093, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hersey, D.
