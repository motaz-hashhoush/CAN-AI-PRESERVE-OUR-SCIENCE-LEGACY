b"FAILURE STRENGTH OF ICY LITHOSPHERES\nM. P. Golombek and W. B. Banerdt (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech,\nPasadena, CA 91109)\nIt has been widely assumed in the literature that the stresses required\nfor brittle failure of an icy lithosphere under tension are limited by the\ntensile strength of intact ice. This assumption has led to the widespread\nuse of 2 MPa (20 bars) for the extensional strength of predominantly ice\nlithospheres (e.g. Ganymede's) , based on the unconfined tensile strength of\n1.\nice near its melting temperature measured by Hawkes and Mellor ( ) However,\nour understanding of the maximum stress levels in the earth's lithosphere\nare based on the frictional resistance to sliding on pre-existing fractures\nand not the strength of. intact rock in laboratory experiments, which is\nalways greater. Similar friction relations for ice predict maximum stresses\nthat are substantially greater than the apparent tensile strength of intact\nice near its melting temperature. At first inspection, then, it appears that\nice rich lithospheres would fail under tensional stress by tensile fracture\nof intact ice rather than sliding on pre-existing fractures. In this abstract we will introduce lithospheric strengths derived from friction on\npre-existing fractures and ductile flow laws, derive these relations for icy\nlithospheres, show that the the tensile strength of intact ice under applicable conditions is actually an order of magnitude stronger than widely\nassumed, and demonstrate that this strength is everywhere greater than that\nrequired to initiate frictional sliding on pre-existing fractures and\nfaults.\nThe maximum stress levels found in the earth's crust are accurately\npredicted by Byerlee's law (2,3). This relation is based on laboratory\nmeasurements of the frictional resistance to sliding on pre-existing fractures, which occurs at stresses less than those required to break intact\nrock. Byerlee's law is of the form t=uSn+b, where t is the shear stress, Sn\nis the effective normal stress (normal stress minus pore pressure), u is the\ncoefficient of friction, and b is a constant. In terms of S1 and S3, the\nmaximum and minimum principal effective stresses (stress minus por\nI'~u\n, presB is\nsure), Byerlee's law can be written S1=KS3+B, where K=[(u 2+)/+]\na function of b and u, and sliding is assumed to occur on the most advantageous slip plane. Laboratory friction measurements show that u and b are\nvirtually independent of stress (except for a slight change for rocks at 135\nMPa), rock type, displacement, surface conditions, and temperature. For this\napplication w e will use the friction law for low stress determined by\nByerlee (2) t=0.85Sn, which has been found to hold for a wide variety of\ngeologic materials, because the appropriate low normal stress friction\nmeasurements on ice have not been made. At higher stress we use the friction\n4.\ndata measured for ice, u=0.2 and b=10 MPa ( ) The higher stress friction\ndata for ice do constrain the applicable low stress friction law to be very\nclose to that for rock, because the lowest normal stress measurements for\nice are for Sn=17 MPa (5), which constrains the low stress friction law,\nthat also must pass through the origin, to have a slope only marginally\ndifferent (u>0.79) from that determined for rocks (u=0.85). In order for\nfluid pore pressure to decrease the friction on pre-existing faults and\nfractures, thereby changing the slope of the brittle yield stress versus\ndepth curve, liquid water must fill the connected pore space. This is not\nlikely to have occurred on the icy satellites given the extremely low\nand\nsurface temperatures (less than 1 0 0 ~ ~ ) reasonable thermal gradients.\nBecause the vertical stress is generally quite close to the lithostatic load\n(density times gravity times depth) in areas of low relief, this relation\n\n5\n\npredicts a linear increase in yield stress with depth (Fig. 1.\n)\nWith increasing temperature, rock and ice deformation occurs by ductile\nflow. Flow laws for rocks, minerals, and ice have been experimentally deterThese\nmined for stresses up to 1 - 2 GPa and strain rates down to 10-~/sec.\nresults can be extrapolated to geologic strain rates via creep equations\n( - Q / de/dt\nwhich generally are of the form ~ ~ / ~ ~ = A ( S ~ - S ~ ) ~ ~ X ~ where R T ) , is\nthe strain rate, R is the gas constant, T is absolute temperature, and A, Q\n(the activation energy), and n are experimentally determined constants. As a\nresult the ductile strength is negligible at depths where T is high and\nincreases exponentially with decreasing depth. We have used the experimen4,\ntally determined flow parameters (6,5) for pure ice Ih, ~ = 1 . 2 x 1 0 - ~ ~ / s e c - ~ a\n4\nQ-4.5~10J/mole and n-4.0 extrapolated to geologic strain rates of 10-15/sec\n(about 3%/m.y.). A surface temperature of 1 0 0 and a thermal gradient of\n~ ~\n1.6O/km applicable to the early high temperatures likely in some of the\n)\nlarger icy satellites (e.g. Ganymede, 7 yields the strength envelope illustrated in Fig. 1. It has been shown at high temperatures (i.e. polar\nconditions on the earth) that the inclusion of a small amount of silicates\n8.\nwill greatly increase the creep strength of ice Ih ( ) The amount of\nhardening from the inclusion of small amounts of silicates in the lithospheres of the icy satellites is not known, but for lack of a better constraint w e will assume that the hardening resulting from the addition of\nless than a few percent of silicates in icy satellites lithospheres can be\n)\nbracketed by an order of magnitude increase in creep strength (e.g. 9.\nThe failure criterion for a given depth in the lithosphere is determined by the weaker of the frictional or ductile strength at that depth. The\nyield stress increases with depth according to Byerlee's law until it exceeds that calculated using the appropriate flow law, after which it decreases exponentially with depth. The intersection of the brittle and ductile yield stress curves defines the brittle-ductile transition depth and\nalso the peak stress needed to cause failure of the entire lithosphere. As a\nresult the peak stress needed for lithospheric failure is dependent on the\nthermal gradient, which causes the ductile flow law to intersect the friction curve at different depths (shallow for high thermal gradients, deep for\nlow thermal gradients). These peak stresses are probably somewhat greater\nthan those actually required to cause failure of the lithosphere because\nsemibrittle and low temperature ductile processes tend to round off the\nintersection points between the brittle and ductile curves ( 0 .\n1)\nAs can be seen in Fig. 1, the peak stress needed to cause tensile\nfailure of the lithosphere using the above parameters is on the order of 10\nMPa (100 bars), although the average stress in the lithosphere is only about\nhalf that value. This strength is applicable for large icy satellites (e.g.\nGanymede). We have also determined strengths for the smaller icy satellites\nof Saturn using the appropriate gravities, densities, surface temperatures,\nand calculated thermal profiles (11) and found all strengths are substantially larger than this value. As a result this value is probably a minimum\nfor the lithospheres of the icy satellites.\nNote that this peak stress (10 MPa) is significantly higher than the\ntensile strength of about 2 MPa used in virtually all previous studies,\nwhich is based on the the unconfined tensile fracture strength of ice near\nits melting temperature. Because failure should occur by the mechanism\nrequiring the lowest stress, it would appear on first inspection that tensile fracture of intact ice is the relevant mode of fracture for icy satellites. However it can be shown using a Griffith failure criterion and taking\nthe vertical lithostatic load into account that the stress difference for\nfailure due to the tensile fracture of intact material at depth z is given\n\nby S1-S3=So+pgz for S1-S3<4So and by S1-S3=4[(Sopgz+So 2)1/2-~o] for\nS1-S3>4So,-where p is denslty, g is gravitational acceleration, and So is\n2.\nthe unconfined tensile strength (e.g. 1 ) The first of these relations describes the opening of tension cracks, which occurs when the confining pressure is relatively low. The second relation describes shear failure in\ntension (or compression), which is the mode of failure when the confining\npressure is too great for open tension cracks to form. The depth of transition between the two modes of tensile failure is given by z=3So/pg (about 5\nkm for S0=2.5 MPa on a satellite with a gravitational acceleration similar\nto that of Ganymede). The curve for failure due to fracture of intact ice is\nplotted in Fig. 1, where it can be seen that frictional failure is preferred\nat all depths for the assumed material parameters of ice. This conclusion is\nborne out by the experimental results, in which ice samples failed due to\nfrictional sliding along pre-existing saw cuts rather than initiating new\nfractures () Note also that if the tensile fracture strength of intact ice\n4.\nincreases with decreasing temperature, as is the case for the compressional\nfracture strength (13), the curve for fracture of intact ice under tension\nwill move to the left and frictional failure will be even more favorable.\nSimilar results are also obtained for other choices of failure criteria.\nThus the failure strength of an icy lithosphere is significantly greater\nthan has been previously assumed.\nIn conclusion, because the tensile strength of intact ice increases\nmarkedly with confining pressure, it actually exceeds the frictional\nstrength at all depths. Thus, icy lithospheres will fail by frictional slip\nalong pre-existing fractures at yield stresses greater than previously\nassumed rather than opening tensile cracks in intact ice.\nReferences (1) Hawkes & Mellor (1972) J Glaciol 11, 103.
