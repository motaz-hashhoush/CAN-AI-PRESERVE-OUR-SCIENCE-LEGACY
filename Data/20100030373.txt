With a bit error rate of less than 1 in\n1017 bits read, the CY-ASP gives you the\nhighest data integrity.\nBased on proven 8mm helical scan\ntechnology, each drive supports our switchselectable data compression option. And\neach drive features a 2-line, 4O-column backlit display that gives complete status information.\nBacked by a two year warranty that includes expert service and support from our\nin-house engineering group, the CY-ASP is\nsetting the pace in performance, flexibility\nand value.\nOther configurations are available, ranging from a 2.5 GB subsystem to an intelligent, automated 3 TB tape library. And\nthey\'re all compatible with the widest range\nof computer systems and networks.\nWhen you\'re ready for a data storage\nsolution that means business, call for\ncomplete information.\n\n(804) 873-9000\nCON T E M P 0 R A R Y\n\nCYBERNETICS\nR Landing Corporate Center . 11846 R Landing\'\nock\nock\n\newpon N\news.

(SGI) seeking its first customers for a new 3D graphics technology.\nAt the same time, in the early 1980s,\nthere was a newly-formed group of aeronautical engineers at NASA\'s Ames Research\nCenter looking for a way to visualize the\nmountains of data generated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research.\n"I realized there was no easy way to\nunderstand all this information except perhaps to put it on a graphics terminal ,"\nrecalled Dr. Thomas Lasinski, one of the\nfirst engineers to join the Numerical Aeronautic Simulation (NAS) program set up to\nserve the entire US aeronautics community. "I wanted three-dimensional real-time\ngraphics that enabled the user to manipulate the screen image instantaneously."\nThe NAS program\'s efforts to put better\nplanes in the sky in turn helped get a future\nindustry leader off the ground. After canvassing the available technology, NAS found\nits best prospect right next door at the\nMountain View, CA, offices of SGI. A formal\nprocurement process resulted in the acquisition of about 25 of the first SGI workstations at $125,000 each. Said Lasinski. "In\n\nY\n\n14\n\nthose days, that was very expensive for a\nworkstation, but NAS wanted to be a pathfinder in the use of new CFD technology."\nThe purchase inaugurated a mutually\nbeneficial relationship that continues today.\n\'\'They turned out to be tremendously useful\nmachines because of the graphical visualization capability, " said Dr. F. Ron Bailey,\ndirector of aerophysics at Ames and a\nmember of the original NAS procurement\nteam. "They also prompted us to develop a\nway of communicating between the workstations and Cray supercomputers."\nFor SGI, the contract meant access to a\ntechnologically advanced user group eager\nto offer advice and make dernands. "NASA\nwas always right there to constructively\ncriticize some of our technologically convenient solutions and so, pushed the quality\nof the designs and products forward at a\nrapid rate," said Forest Baskett, SGI\'s senior\nvice president of R&D and chief technology\nofficer. Moreover, he said, as SGI\'s first big\ncustomer, "NASA lent the company a lot of\ncredibility with the business and investment\ncommunities, which enabled us to get\nfunding for subsequent rounds of development. " Today, the company\'s annual sales\nexceed $1 .1 billion.\n\nCFDGoes3D .\nThe CFD field had been uniquely poised\nfor the leap to 3D graphics sirnulation .\n"Visualization has a long history in fluid\n\nmechanics-wind tunnel data had been\nvisualized with water tanks or by taking\nphotographs. So, to visualize a numerical\ncalculation of a flow field is a very natural\nthing to want to do," said Lasinski, who\nnow serves as chief of the NAS Applied\nResearch Branch. "The calculation we do\non the supercomputer is like a numerical\nwind tunnel and the computer graphics is\nlike taking a videotape of that wind tunnel\nand playing it back."\nDr. David Cooper, chief of the NAS\nSystems Division, explained further: \'\'To do\na very fine calculation, you take an airplane\nconfiguration and put in as many as 50\nmillion grid points and then solve the\nNavier-Stokes equations for each of these\npoints, for each of five variables-velocity,\npressure, density, etc.-obviously, you\ncan\'t hand-plot these."\nSoftware developed by both SGI and\nNASA, and running on the SGI machines,\nenables engineers to turn these massive\ndata sets into active 3D images. Manipulating these images offers new insights into\nhow an aircraft\'s design might be improved.\nAs anyone who has experienced virtual\nreality knows, no 20 image can convey\nthe liveliness of SGI\'s 3D graphics, where\nobjects look , move , and behave like\nobjects in the real world. "It\'s not the pretty\npictures that are the real power of these\nmachines, " stressed Lasinski . "Static\nimages can\'t reveal the dynamic interplay\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nas the engineer or scientist manipulates\nthe image and flow fields and sees the correlations between different parts of the\nflow field and image as it is rotated."\nVisual computing offers similar benefrts\nin an increasingly broad range of applications, including molecular modeling, special effects animation, and virtual realitybased entertainment. Designing products\nusing 3D graphics can reduce costs and\ndevelopment cycles while spurring innovation by allowing much of the work to be\ndone on screen and reducing the need for\nphysical prototypes.\nOver the years, the drive to improve\nCFD analysis prompted NAS engineers to\nseek specific attributes in their computer\nequipment, such as floating point and\nNTSC output capabilities. \'\'They pushed us\npretty hard on antialiasing," recalled SGI\nVice President and Chief Engineer Kurt\nAkeley. "But we improve our machines as\nmuch from working to meet their benchmarks as from specifiC verbal suggestions."\nSubsequent procurements and the\nclose interchange of ideas accelerated the\nmaturization of SGI\'s products, according\nto Bailey. "If we liked something and asked\nfor it, they generally found their other scientific users would also want it. Also, we\nhad some application software, such as\nPLOT3D, that was very popular on the SGI\nmachines because it took advantage of\nthe raster display manipulation capabilities."\nSGI currently markets a wide range of\nvisual computing systems, from the new\nIndyTM desktop system, which includes a\ndigital color video camera, to the OnyxTM\nadvanced graphics supercomputers, the\nfirst to incorporate multiple MIPS\xc2\xae RISC\nR4400 processors.\n"NASA is still a very important customer\nto us. They stress our new designs in a\nway that helps us understand how to provide new capabilities that are actually useful to customers," said Baskett. The NAS\nfacility currently is helping to develop software products for SGI\'s new Power Challenge\xe2\x84\xa2 supercomputer servers. Built with\nan eye toward NAS benchmarks, the\nmachines employ the new MIPS\xc2\xae R8000\nmicroprocessor to offer the fastest available\nfloating point performance.\nSaid Lasinski: "NASA was there, investing in those early and expensive boxes\nand funding the company because it had\ngood technology, so that ten years later it\ncould produce something that\'s a fifth of\nthe price with over a hundred times the\ngraphics capability." 0\nFor more information about the technology\ndescribed in this article, contact: Silicon Graphics\nInc., 2011 N.

This scheme would enable the\nestablishment of eight data paths by use\nof only four electrical paths extending out\nof each processing element: that is, the\nnumber of electrical interconnections\nwould be no greater than that of a lesscapable four-nearest-neighbor orthogonal (north, east, south, west) grid.\nA wideband, multiple-bit input/output\nbus would be connected via column-select circuitry to all the processing elements\nin each row. The combination of the row\nbuses and the column-select circuitry would\nenable communication between external\nmemory and any or all processing elements. For example, data could be transmitted to a single processing element during one processing cycle, to a group of\nadjacent or nonadjacent processing elements in a row during one processing cycle, or broadcast simultaneously to all processing elements in any or all rows. To\nreduce data-access time further and thereby increase processing speed further, a\nlocal memory would be incorporated into\neach processing element.\n\n18\n\nProcessing Elements Would\nCommunicate\nwith each other\non an "X" interconnection grid\nand with extemal\nmemory via a\nhigh-capacity\ninpUVoutpul bus.\n\nLocal\n\nLocal Arithmetic\nand Logic Unit\n\nControl\nUnit\nLocal Memory\n\nPROCESSING ELEMENT\n\nEach processing element would modify global (that is, broadcast) instructions\nand exert local control to optimize execution of the instructions. A broadcast memory address could be modified in each\nprocessing element to enable access to its\ninternal memory. Each processing element would include a bidirectional, variable-length, N-bit shift register that would\nhave active and inactive segments, such\nthat shifts would take place in active segments only during a shift cycle. The active\nand inactive segments would be independent of each other, allowing for temporary storage of such data as local offset\naddresses in the inactive segments.\nEach processing element could alter a\nbroadcast instruction that had a condiSpecial Focus\n\ncontinued on page 22\n\ntional structure, so that those\' actions within a conditional structure that were\ncomplements of each other could be\nperformed at the same time in different\nprocessing elements. That is, only one\npass over the data would suffice for processing both conditions. This approach\nto conditional operation would nearly\ndouble the speed of various arithmetic\noperations.\nThis work was done by Robert A.\nHeaton and Donald W.

The three-bus configuration provides redundancy for protection against failure of one of the\nprocessors and against failures of one or\ntwo buses. In the original application for\nwhich this triple-bus architecture was conceived, the data processors were singlecircuit -board computers aboard a spacecraft, and the remote terminals were digital\nelectronic circuits associated with various\nspacecraft instruments. This triple-bus\narchitecture could just as well be used\nfor fault tolerance in similar terrestrial digital electronic systems.\nIn the original application, data processor 1 communicated with remote terminals 1 and 2 only. In the present three-bus\nsystem, data processor 1 is still dedicated\nprimarily to remote terminals 1 and 2; normally, these three units communicate via\ntheir A ports, which are connected to bus\nC. Similarly, in the original application,\ndata processor 2 communicated with\nremote terminals 3 and 4 only. In the present three-bus system, data processor 2\nis still dedicated primarily to remote terminals 3 and 4; normally, these three units\ncommunicate via their A ports, which are\nconnected to bus A.\nTo provide the desired redundancy, bus\nB is connected to the B ports of both data\nprocessors and all four remote terminals.\nDuring normal operation, bus B is not\nused. If either data processor 1 or data\nprocessor 2 fails, it is isolated from bus C,\n\nBus B\n\n(Redundant)\n\nBus B Provides Redundancy for protection against failure of one of the processors or of either\nor both of buses A and C.\n\nand its functions are performed by the\nremaining functional data processor, which\nthen communicates with all remote units\nover bus B. Inasmuch as all remote-terminal addresses are unique, there are no\naddressing conflicts. Other than some\nreduction in the allocation of computing\npower (because now one data processor\nmust serve four instead of two remote terminals), there is no loss of performance.\nIf bus A fails, then data processor 2\ncan communicate with remote terminals 3\nor 4 via bus B, while data processor 2\ncontinues to communicate, in the normal\nway, with remote terminals 1 and 2 via\nbus C. Similarly, if bus C fails, data\nprocessor 1 can communicate with\nremote terminals 1 and 2 via bus B, while\ndata processor 2 continues to communicate, normally, with remote terminals 3\n\nand 4 via bus A. Again, because addresses are unique, the remote terminals not\nmeant to receive communications on bus\nB can simply ignore them.\nIf bus B fails but all other parts of the\nsystem are functional, then there is no\nloss of communication because bus B is\nnot normally used. If buses A and C both\nfail, then bus B is used for all communications among all units. If both (1) one of\nthe data processors and (2) one of the\nprimary buses (bus A or bus C) fail, then\nthe remaining functional data processor\nand bus B can take their places.\n\nThis work was done by Richard B.\nKatz and Michael D.

GSC-13623.\n\nC High-Speed Optical Wide-Area Data-Communication Network\nCongestion would be relieved through dynamic interconnection of multiple routing planes.\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA proposed fiber-optic wide-area network rNAN) for digital communication would\nbalance input and output flows of data with\nits internal capacity by routing traffic via\ndynamically interconnected routing planes.\nData would be transmitted optically through\nthe network by wavelength-division multiplexing in synchronous or asynchronous\npackets. This WAN could be implemented\nwith currently available technology. In\ncomputer simulations, a network of this\ntype successfully routed all input packets\n\n22\n\nat 1.5 times the theoretical minimum routing latency.\nThe network would be a multiple-ring\ncyclic shuffle exchange network (see Figure 1), which would ensure that traffic reaches its destination with a minimum number\nof hops. Switching nodes within the network would make routing decisions to\nalleviate congestion by deflecting interfering packets to alternative layers in the\nshuffle exchange network. This scheme\nuses permutation engine (PE) switching\ncontinued from page 18\n\nnodes, which provide constant routing latency through distributed control of a mesh\ntopology and are well suited to an ali-optical data path network. Specifically, the\nswitching nodes operate in a bit-synchronous, packet-asynchronous mode (meaning incoming packets need only be reclocked for bit alignment but not for\npacket alignment). The distributed control and switching hardware for this crossbar could be built using current electronic\nand/or optical/electro-optic technology.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nHost\n\nHost\n\nComputer\n\nComputer\n3\n\nt\n\nHost\n\nHost\n\nComputer\n\nComputer\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFigure 1.

Two Recirculation Links in a switching node would provide for a two-stage queue with\nfirst-in/first-out characte ristics.\n\nFor a single-ring shuffle exchange network, 3-by-3 switching nodes are needed\nto accommodate two network ports and a\nhost port. An m-ring shuffle exchange\nnetwork requires (2m + 1)-by-(2m + 1)\nswitching nodes for one host port and\nports per ring. The mesh topology and\ndistributed routing algorithm make the\n\nswitching nodes expandable in increments\nof one inpuVoutput connection to provide\nthe flexibility needed to accommodate the\nm-ring shuffle exchange topology.\nThe constant routing delay of a switching node also provides a simple relation\nbetween the number of hops a packet\nmakes through the shuffle exchange net-\n\nwork and the routing delay through the network. Here a hop corresponds to each\nswitching node a packet must traverse in\nrouting from any network input to any network output. The important point is that\nthe average routing delay through the network is known given the expected number\nof hops for the shuffle exchange topology.\nThe ratio of this delay to the time it takes to\ninput a packet into the network determines the number of rings needed for\ncrossbarlike operation at the network level.\nContention at a network output port is\nhandled by recirculating queues. A recirculating queue can be implemented at\neach switching node (see Figure 2) by increasing the number of inpuVoutput ports\nby one for each queue. The extra inpuV\noutput ports would be connected in a\nwraparound fashion allowing those packets that were not able to leave the node\nthrough the port to the host computer\n("host port") to reenter the destination\nnode. Thus, packets that were blocked\nfrom the host port at the destination node\ncould try again without recirculating through\nthe shuffle exchange network. The strategy\nwould be followed to avoid packet deflections whenever possible, albeit at the\nexpense of increased mean routing latency.\nThis work was done by Steve P.\nMonacos of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The basic network concept is described in the preceding article,\n"High-Speed Optical Wide-Area Data-Communication Network" (NPO-18983). The basic design of a permutation engine is defined by a nonblocking crossbar topology\nand a distributed routing algorithm (that is,\na routing algorithm that does not require\ncomplicated centralized electronic con trol circuitry, which could constrict switching speed).\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\n,\n\nInput\nPOfIS\n\n;\n\n,\n\nLink\nLabels\n\n2x2\n\n............. .....,...................................\n\n,:\n\n2,\n\n.......\n\nSwitch\n\n~\n\n4\n\n,\n\nOutput\nPorts\n\n:\n\n\'5\n\n..............\n\n........................................................~ .\n,\n,\n:\nt\xc2\xb7,,_\xc2\xb7:\n\n5 ---:....-.\n\nI\n\nFigure 1.

The SingleRing SN is a unidirectional, wrap-around topology with 3 x 3 switching\nnodes. The direction of\ndata flow is depicted by\nthe arrows. One pair of\nnode I/o ports connect\nto the host device with\nthe remaining I/o ports\nconnecting to other SN\nnodes.\n\nA permutation engine operates in a bitsynchronous, packet-asynchronous mode,\nmeaning that incoming packets need only\nbe reclocked for alignment of bits but not\nfor alignment of packets. The term "permutation engine" represents th~ ability of\nthe routing algorithm and crossbar topology to sort any permutation of destinations while packets are in transit through\nthe matrix, so that packets reach the\nproper output ports of the crossbar matrix\n(see Figure 1). The only input required by\n\nthe routing algorithm is the destination of\neach packet.\nOf particular interest is a switching node\n(made of PE\'s) for a larger network. Such\na network, for example, could be the 8node cyclic shufflenet (SN) shown in Figure\n2. Permutation engines are located at the\nnodes of the network, where they route\npackets of data through the links of Figure\n2. The use of PE switching nodes allows\nfor packet asynchronous operation needed to build an all-optical data path net-\n\nwork. For the multiring shufflenet topology\ndescribed in the preceding article, the PE\nswitching nodes also provide for dynamic\nrouting of packets between rings.\nWhen packets from more than one input port are destined for the same output\nport, one of the packets is sent to that\noutput port, while the others are redirected to adjacent output ports. By connecting input and output ports to various ring\nlayers in the multiple-ring shufflenet topology, one can buffer the packets from multiple sources to the same destination host.\nThat is, the excess packets are essentially stored in transit by making each one\ndetour through the network until its tum to\nbe received at the destination. To state it\nyet another way, blocking is prevented at\nthe cost of additional delay for packets\nthat contend for the same destination.\nThis work was done by Steve P.\nMonacos of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

This is especially true if the cables\nmust be tested for both open and short\ncircuits for all of the various combinations\nof conductors. The inexpensive circuit shown\nin the figure simplifies the task.\nThe source of power for this cable-testing circuit is a small 120-Vac-to-5-Vdc, 250mA power supply. Ught-emitting diodes\n(LED\'s) with built-in current-limiting resistors\nfor 5-V operation are used throughout the\ncircuit as indicators.\nIn operation, a pair of connectors is\nselected to match the pair of connectors\ninstalled on each of the cables to be tested. As many connectors can be accommodated as required, and each can\nhave as many conductors as required.\nA single-pole/single-throw (SP81) toggle switch is provided for each conductor\nof whichever cable in the system has the\ngreatest number of conductors. One side\nof each switch is tied to the positive side\nof the 5-V power supply. The other side is\nfed to one of the connectors indicated as\nJ1 through J3 in the schematic diagram.\nThese are designated as output connectors in the system .\nA mating connector, designated as the\ninput connector for the other side of each\ncable is provided. The connectors of this\nclass are identified as J4 through J6 in\nthe schematic diagram. One conductor of\neach of the output connectors is connected\nin parallel to the anode of an LED. One\nLED is required for each conductor of the\ncable that has the greatest number of\nconductors. The cathodes of the LED\'s\nare tied together and connected to the\ncommon side of the 5-V power supply.\nAt the beginning of a test, all of the\nswitches are tumed off. First, one tums on\npower switch 85 and verifies that LED5 illuminates. Then one tums on switches 81\nthrough 84, one at a time. Only the LED\ncorresponding to the switch that is on\nshould illuminate. The current flows through\nthe switch to the output connector, through\nthe cable to the input connector, through\nthe LED, and back to the power supply.\nAn open conductor in the test cable is indicated if the corresponding LED is not\nilluminated.

In comparison with older bypass\ndevices for the same application, this one\nweighs less, generates less heat, and has\na lower voltage drop (less resistance).\nThe bypass device (see figure) is connected in parallel with the power cell. The\ntwo diodes connected in parallel in opposite polarities serve to limit the current\nthrough the bypass device to very low\nvalues until the voltage across the cell\nand bypass device exceeds either of two\nspecified limits that are slightly beyond\nthe normal charging and discharging voltages of the cell. That is, the bypass circuit\ndraws very little current during normal\noperation of the cell . For example, one\ndiode could be chosen to allow significant current to flow when the voltage during charging of the cell exceeds 1.5 V,\nwhile the other diode could be chosen\nto allow significant current to flow when\nthe discharge drives the cell to or beyond\n0 .5 V reverse polarity.\nWhen the voltage begins to exceed\neither limit, significant current begins to\nflow through one of the diodes and\nthrough the tension spring, which is made\nof a shape-memory alloy (nickel and titanium, for example). When the current\nheats the spring beyond the transition\ntemperature of the shape-memory alloy,\nthe spring goes from its relatively relaxed\ncondition to a more taut condition, in\n\nSplined-Tube\nSprings\n\nElectrically Insulating Case\n\n--\n\n-\n\nCurrent\n\nSHUNT OPEN (NORMAL CONDITION)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nSHUNT CLOSED AFTER OPEN-CIRCUIT FAILURE OF CELL\n\nThe Low-Voltage Bypass Device creates a low-resistance electrical path around a power cell\nwhen the cell fails in the open-circuit condition.\n\nwhich it was fabricated (when heated, it\nexerts a strong force tending to retum it to\nits "remembered" fabricated shape).\nThe sudden increase in spring tension\nis sufficient to pull the shunt away from its\ninitial detent position in contact with the\nright set of splined-tube springs and into a\nnew detent position in contact with both\nsets of splined-tube springs. In the new\ndetent position, the shunt completes an\nelectrical path around the diodes, thus providing a low-resistance electrical path in\n\nparallel with the cell. When the electrical\nheating of the spring ceases and the\nspring cools to below the transition temperature, the shunt remains in the new\ndetent position, continuing to provide a\nlow-resistance path around the cell.\n\nThis work was done by J.

This circuit is intended\nfor use with a power-consuming electronic system that draws pulsed currents\nand that includes a capacitor bank as a\nlow-impedance secondary source from\nwhich the pulsed currents can be drawn.\nBecause the capacitor bank also acts\nas a low-impedance load on the bus, the\npeak current that it draws from the source\nwhen power is first applied or when there\nis a positive transition in bus voltage is\n\n36\n\nlimited (in the absence of a protective circuit) only by the output impedance of the\nsource and by the impedance of an electromagnetic-interference filter (if any) in\nseries with the source and bus.\nThe protective circuit comprises three\nfunctional blocks: a resettable timer, latch,\nand current source; an overload detector;\nand a bus-voltage-droop detector. The\ncircuit performs the following three functions:\n1. It limits the inrush current that\nflows upon the application of power\nand after transients in bus voltage.\n\n2.

Heretofore, the additional filtering circuitry needed to obtain comparable reductions in ripple were typically as\nlarge and heavy as the original regulator.\nUke many other power-supply circuits,\na switching voltage regulator includes a\nlow-pass output filter that effects at least\na first -order reduction of ripple in that it reduces the ac component of voltage generated by switching of one or more power\ntransistor(s). The filter includes a capacitor\nconnected across the output terminals, in\nparallel with the load. The essence of the\npresent technique is to inject, into this\ncapacitor, a current equal in amplitude\nand wave shape but opposite in phase to\nthe ripple current that already flows into\nthis capacitor. In principle, this would\nreduce the net ripple current and thus\nthe net ripple voltage to zero. In practice,\nthe net amplitude of the ripple current\n\n,\n\nSimple Additional Circuitry\nthat consists of relatively small\ncomponents can reduce the\noutput ripple by a factor of\nabout 10.

The voltage error is the difference between the\nactual output voltage and the outputreference voltage, which is the nominal\noutput voltage at zero current. The\npulse-width modulation is varied to increase or decrease the current, as needed , to limit the excursion of output voltage from the reference value.\nAn additional feature of this control\ncircuit is that the maximum current in\neither direction can be limited by limiting\nthe excursion of the output voltage from\nthe zero-current value.

The reaction-wheel\nattitude-control system was designed primarily to maintain the desired orientation of\na spacecraft but might also be useful in\nmaintaining the desired orientation of a\nterrestrial antenna, optical instrument, or\nother device on an aircraft, ship, land vehicle, or other moving platform.\nFigure 1 illustrates the principle of operation of a prior version of the system\nfor the case of a single axis of rotation (in\ngeneral, of course, there would be three\naxes of rotation). The output of an attitude sensor is integrated over time to generate a torque-command signal for a\nmotor that drives the reaction wheel. As\nlong as the wheel turns, the frictional\ntorque in the bearings includes a fluid\ncomponent that increases with speed plus\na coulomb component, 7;;, that is constant with speed. Once the wheel stops, it\nis necessary to overcome the static frictional torque, l"s, which is somewhat\ngreater than 7;;, to start the wheel turning\nagain.\nDuring a control action, the wheel can\nget stuck at zero speed until the integrated attitude error gives rise to a torque\ncommand sufficient to start the wheel\nturning again. While the wheel is stuck,\nthe attitude error accumulates; when the\nwheel starts to tum again, the torque command that has built up can cause the\nwheel to overshoot the desired attitude\ncoordinate.\nTo compensate partly for this effect,\nthe prior version of the system includes an\noffset compensator, which performs the\nfollowing computation and control action:\nWhen the speed lies within a prescribed\nrange near zero, the value of the torque\ncommand is measured and assumed to\ncorrespond to 7;;. Then when the speed of\nthe wheel decreases to zero, the offset\ncompensator helps to reverse the speed;\nthat is, it helps to prevent the wheel from\ngetting stuck at zero speed by adding, to\nthe torque command, an offset that corresponds to -27;; according to the value\nassumed from the most recent measure40\n\nFrictional Torque\n\n----\'----\'--+-..----,...------\n\nSpeed of Rotation\n\nWheel-Speed\nSensor\n\nIntegrator\n\nFigure 1.

The Present Version of the Attitude-Control System includes the dither control and\ngenerator unit, which helps to suppress the remaining zero-speed errors by keeping the speed away\nfrom zero most of the time.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nment described above. However, some\nerror remains because the offset computation does not take accurate account of\nall frictional and dynamical effects.\nThe present system (see Figure 2) is\nsimilar to the prior system except that it\nincludes the dither control and generator\nunit, which helps to overcome the error\nthat remains after the offset computation\nand control action. When the speed approaches zero within a prescribed value,\nthis unit adds a torque command that alternates with a sinusoidal, sawtooth, or\nother symmetrical waveform at a frequen-\n\ncy much greater than any frequency that\ncharacterizes the motion of the object,\nthe attitude of which is to be controlled.\nThe amplitude of this waveform is made\nlarge enough to exceed T;; and l\'c under all\nconditions. Thus, even when the wheel\ngets stuck, it does not remain stuck during\nmore than a fraction of the dither period;\nthe amount of attitude error that can accumulate during this short time is insignificant. The small attitude error contributed by the dither signal itself does not\naccumulate: because of the symmetry of\nthe dither torque command, the dithered\n\ncomponent of the integrated attitude error\nremains near zero.\nThis w ork was done by John B.\nStetson, Jr., of General Bectric Co. for\nGoddard Space Flight Center.

In a receiver of the type in which the technique can be\nused, (1) the intermediate-frequency version of the signal is first passed through a\nfilter of bandwidth sufficient to accommodate\nthe highest potential signal rate, (2) the filtered signal is processed through an analog-to-digital converter, and then (3) the\nbandwidth is reduced at baseband, prior to\nthe remainder of demodulator processing, by use of a preaveraging technique.\nThe improved technique in question is an\nupdated version of an older preaveraging\ntechnique; the net effect of the upgrade is\nto decrease the vulnerability of the receiver\nto interference by signals in adjacent frequency channels.\nIn the older preaveraging technique (see\nFigure 1), two accumulators that operate\nin parallel form the averages of digitized\nsamples of the baseband signal at a rate\nN times the data-symbol rate. Each accumulator puts out an average value sample\nat intervals of N samples (1 symbol period), and is reset to accumulate the next N\nsamples during the next symbol period.\nThe accumulators dump their totals at\nstaggered times, the outputs of one being\ndeSignated as "even," the outputs of the\nother being designated as "odd." The even\nand odd streams of averages are used\nfor different purposes in the processing\nof the carrier and modulating signals and\nthe detection of data in the modulation.\nThis technique is covered under U.S.\nPatent No. 5,052,027, "Programmable\nNoise Bandwidth Reduction by Means of\nDigital Averaging," September 24, 1991.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nEven-Output Sample\nAccumulator\n\xc2\xb7- - --- - ---R;;S~~ -- -\n\nEven\nBarrel\nRegister Output\nI--~--I~~ Shifter t--i~D:;-;:Q;r-----"\'~\nResete\n\nAnalog-toDigital Converter\n\nBaseband\nInput\n~\n\n--------- - -----\n\nOdd-Output Sample\nAccumulator\nScaling of\n\xe2\x80\xa2 - - - - - - - - - R;giste~ - - - , Most-Significant\nBits\n:\n.-------1 Q D\n\nc\n~\n\nSampling-Rate\n(N x Symbol Rate)\nClock Signal\n\nC\n\n-~\n\n~-~\n\n\xc2\xa3...\n\nt\n\nC\nSymbOI_Rate\nClock Signal\n\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nI\n\nReseto\n\nOdd\nOutput\n\n\'\n,\n\nBarrel\nI-----I-+J~ Shifter\n\n--- - ----------\n\n:\n,\n\n-~\n\nc\n\nC\n\nScaling of\nMost-Significant\nBits\n\nSymbol-Rate\nClock Signal\n\nFigure 1. The Older Preaverager includes two accum ulators that put out average sample values eve ry N samples (1 symbol period). The output times are staggered, yielding "even" and\n"odd" output average streams.\n\nThe time-domain response of the older\npreaverager is essentially a train of impulses one symbol long, and the corresponding frequency response, sin x/x, is\nthat of a filter that does not reject adjacent\nfrequency channels as sharply as desired.\nAs a result, performance is degraded when\na signal is present in an adjacent chan-\n\nnel. In the improved preaveraging technique, the frequency response of the filter\nis made to roll off more sharply in adjacent\nchannels, by means of two principal modifications: (1) the input samples are multiplied by an impulse-response weighting\nfunction (e.g., a raised cosine) before accumulation, and (2) the length of the averag41\n\ning period (impulse response aperture) is\nextended to 2 symbol periods.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the improved\npreaverager includes four multipliers and\nfour accumulators. The incoming digitized\nsamples at N times the symbol rate are\nmultiplied by four identical impulseresponse weighting functions that are staggered and overlapped at half-symbol (N/2)\nintervals. Each weighting function is associated with one of the multiplier/accumulators and repeats every 2 symbol periods.\nThe operation of the even and odd pairs is\nstaggered to provide even and odd out-\n\nputs at the symbol rate. In effect, the multipflEll\'/aa:unulators perform four parallel, timestaggered finite-impulse-response filtering\noperations. Because the averaging interval\nis 2 symbol periods, the bandwidth of the\nimproved preaverager (regarded as a fitter) is\napproximately half the symbol rate. A continuation-in-part patent application was filed\nfor this newer technique on July 18, 1991.\nThis work was done by John J.\nPoklemba of Communications Satellite\nCorp. for Lewis Research Center.

The accumulation period is increased to 2N samples (2 symbol\nperiods) , and operation is staggered so that, again, even and odd averages are produced at\nintervals of 1 symbol period, through interlacing of the individual parallel streams that yield outputs every 2 symbols.\n\n42\n\nRobust Routing\nProtocol For\nDigital Messages\nCommunication in a network\nof computers is maintained\neven when links fail.\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, Pasadena, California\nA refinement of a digital-message-routing protocol increases the fautt tolerance of\npolled networks. The refinement, AbNET-3,\nis the latest of the generic AbNEr protocols\nfor the transmission of messages among\ncomputing nodes.\nThe AbNEr concept was described in\n"Multiple-Ring Digital Communication Network" (NPO-18133), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol.\n16, No. 11 (November 1992), page 54. In\nAbNEr, the nodes of a network can be\nconnected in a variety of ways that are\nnot restricted to standard ring, mesh, or\nother regular configurations. With AbNEr\nprotocols, messages can be routed from\nany node to any or all other node(s), with\nno reconfiguration as the network changes.\nIn the basic AbNEr protocol, each computer (node) that receives a message\ndetermines whether that message has\nbeen received before. If so, the computer\ndiscards the message. If not, the computer considers the message new, and\nretransmits the message on some or all\nof the communication lines available to it.\nEach computer in the network has more\nthan one connection to other computers in\nthe network. Each computer has a unique\nnode number. When a computer originates a message, it creates a message\nnumber and sends the node number/message number pair out across all its connections.\nAbNEr-3 is specifically aimed at increaSing the fault tolerance of the network\nin the broadcast mode, in which one node\nbroadcasts a message to and receives\nresponses from all other nodes. AbNEr-3\nhelps to ensure that a failed connection\nbetween a pair of nodes does not ruin all\ncommunication. In AbNEr-3, when a node\nreceives a broadcast message, it responds\non all lines. It then rebroadcasts the broadcast message on all lines except the line on\nwhich it received the broadcast message.\nIn prescribing that a node send out its\nresponse on all lines connected to it,\nAbNEr-3 differs from previous AbNEr\nprotocols, in which a node responds only on\nthe line on which it received the broadcast\nmessage. AbNEr-3 also differs from previous AbNET protocols, in which a node simulNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\ntaneously (1) responds on the line on which\nit received the broadcast message and (2)\nretransmits the broadcast message on all\nother lines connected to it.\nThis work was done by Mac/en Marvit\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\n\xc2\xb7Laboratory.

This\nmethod is simpler than another, recently\nproposed HMM method is but retains the\nadvantages of that method, including low\nsusceptibility to false alarms, no need for a\nmathematical model of the dynamics of\n\nthe system under normal or faulty conditions, and ability to detect subtle changes\nin the characteristics of the monitored signals (which are time series that represent\nmultiple sensor outputs). Examples of systems that could be monitored by use of\nthis method include motors, turbines, and\npumps that are critical in their applications;\nchemical-processing plants; powerplants;\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nThe Hidden-MarkovModel Method (in\nboth its prior version\nand the present\nimproved version) is\na special case of the\nparameter method of\ndetecting faults:\nChanges in the parameters of a mathematical model fitted\nto input and output\ndata are examined\nto detect faults.\n\nInputs\n\nOutputs\n\nDetection of Changes in Parameters\n\nranges). Where prior knowledge is available, other prior densities\ncan be used.\nAt the price of some repetition, the concept of the improved HMM\nmethod can now be darified and summarized by describing its implementation in the following steps:\n1. Set up a two-state hidden Markov model as described\nabove.\n2. Obtain the transition probabilities for the Markov portion of\nthe model from mean-time-to-failure and mean-time-to-repair\ndata.\n3. Determine the functional form of p(~I~ as described above.\n4. For each parametsr ~, 1 ~j ~ P (where P is the number of\nparameters), specify the upper and lower bounds, aj and bj respectively, on its possible values.\n5. Specify the density Pprior( eI~) as\n\nn\nJ\n\nP pr ior( elw2 ) =\nand biomedical systems.\nThe improved HMM method is based on four assumptions.\nUnlike the prior HMM method, it is not assumed that time series\ndata on faults are available to train the hidden Markov model.\nInstead, it is assumed that (1) a large number of training data are\navailable from operation under normal conditions and (2) physical\nconstraints on possible changes in the time series are known. As\nin the prior method, it is also assumed that (3) the observed\ntime-series data are stationary under both normal and faulty conditions and (4) the mean time between failures in each fault mode\nis known or can be estimated.\nDefinitions and explanations of some terms are prerequisite to\na description of the improved HMM method. Let those parameters\nof the monitored system that are of interest at time t be denoted\nas the components of a vector W). The parameters are typically\nstatistical estimates of such characteristics of the time series as the\nmeans, the variances, or the coefficients of autoregression (see figure). In the HMM approach, it is by observing changes in these\nderived parameters that one detects changes in the underlying time\nseries (and, hence, the system itsel~.\nThe prior HMM method involves the assumption that there are m\nmutually exclusive states or conditions of the system; these states\nare denoted ~ through wm\' where ~ represents the normal condition and ~ through wm represent faulty conditions. Central to\nthis method is a set of probability estimates of the form p(~t)ICO;(t\xc2\xbb,\n1 ~ i ~ m. These estimates, in tum, are obtained by Bayes\' rule\nfrom the estimates p(CO;(t)l~t\xc2\xbb, which are learned from the training\ndata. Inasmuch as the process is assumed to be stationary given w,\nthe reference to time t can be dropped at this point. This completes\nthe definition and explanation of terms.\nThe improved method differs from the prior method in two ways:\n1. One uses a hidden Markov model of only two states: w1\n(normal) and ~ (nonnormal). For the normal state, one calcuIatesp(w,I~ by use of either a parametric density or a nonparametric density estimate wherein the density is fitted to the available\ntraining data.\n2. For the non normal state, one specifies a prior density in the\nform of pprio,(\xc2\xa3;liw.zl,\nThe first change is straightforward. The second change requires\nthat Pprior(eI~) be available. In the absence of any other specific\ninformation about the behavior of under fault conditions, one can\nspecify a uniform density for Ppna-(eI~), wherein the ranges correspond to the physical limits on the parameters. In practice,\nthese limits are usually available. For example, the variances of signals can be bounded on the basis of the overall energy available to\nthe system. Similarly, coefficients of autoregression must obey\nconstraints consistent with the stationary nature of the processes.\nThe choice of uniform density is the most appropriate when there\nis no prior knowledge about the parameters (other than the\n\n} =1\n\nb\nl\n\n~ 81\n\nif there is no prior knowledge available other than the ranges of\nvalues of parameters and the density under nonrnal conditions (,8~I ~.\nIf prior knowledge is available, then use this information to specify Ppri_\n\nor(eI~).\n\n6.

Because electron-attachment ion\nsources form molecular ions with less\nfragmentation of molecules than occurs in\nother electron-bombardment ion sources,\nthey can enable the identification of the\ntarget molecules in a mass spectrometer.\nIn comparison with the older reversal\nelectron-attachment detector, the miniREAD is simpler in design; more rugged ;\nand easier to build, repair, and maintain.\nIn addition, the miniREAD will probably be\nmore sensitive, because (1) the volume of\nits electron/molecule-interaction region is\nlarger and (2) electrons and ions will be\nmore spread out, so that space charge\nwill constitute less of a limitation, and\nhence higher electron currents can be\nused.\n\nIn the miniREAD, electrons from a standard Bayard-Alpert ionization-gauge filament are accelerated through an outer\nconical or cylindrical grid electrode toward an inner cylindrical grid or porous\nelectrode (see figure).

The inner\nelectrode is biased negatively so that the\ntrajectories of the electrons reverse just\noutside this electrode. The small target\ngas effuses through holes in this electrode. Some of the decelerated electrons\nbecome attached to the target molecules.\nThe resulting negative ions are then\nextracted, either through weak fringing\nfields or in a pulsed operation, toward the\naperture plate, and are focused onto the\nentrance plane of a quadrupole mass analyzer. The target molecules are then identified in terms of their characteristic mass\nspectrum.\nWhen tested with CCl 4 - which had\nbeen shown previously to simulate the\n\nbehavior of some organic explosivesion-count rates of 100kHz were obtained\neasily; it is conservatively estimated that,\nwith higher filament power and efficient\nextraction of ions, rates about 1,000 times\nas large are possible.

Johnson Space Center; Houston, Texas\nExperiments have shown that (1) small\nchanges in ambient temperatu re can\ncause significant shifts in the apparent\npositions of peaks in x-ray spectra (see\nfigure) during quantitative analyses by\nuse of electron microprobes operating in\nconjunction with automated wavelengthdispersive x-ray spectrometers; and (2)\none can correct for such shifts by using a\ncomputer subroutine to recalibrate x-ray\npeak positions. This correction technique\nobviates frequent manual recalibration of\nthe standard peak locations and x-ray\nintensities of individual chemical elements,\nthus enabling operation of unattended\ninstruments, as in overnight collection of\ndata, and freeing analysts to spend more\ntime interpreting data.\nIn operation for the experiments, an\nelectron microprobe was programmed\nto perform 200 analyses of a standard\nspecimen using three wavelength-dispersive x-ray spectrometers. The original\nanalytical software was modified to verify\nx-ray peak positions before each analysis,\nas well as to record the shifts in the\napparent pOSitions of the spectral peaks.\nInitially a microprocessor "get-element"\nfunction was used to move the spectrometers to the theoretical position of a\nspectral peak of a given element to verify that the peaks could be observed at\nthose positions. Next, a microprocessor\n"peak" function was used to locate the\ntrue position of the peak for each spectrometer. The difference between the\ntrue and the theoretical position of each\npeak for each spectrometer was recorded in a file. Finally, a microprocessor\n"set-motor-position" function was used\nto correct the spectrometer positions (by\nuse of drive motors) for the subsequent\nanalysis. In each case in which the spectral peak was not insufficiently intense\nenough to enable a valid determination of\nits apparent position on any spectrometer, a discriminatory algorithm prevented\nthe resetting of the position of that spectrometer.\nThe following conclusions (among\nothers) were drawn from the results of\nthe experiments:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A change of 3 O in the ambient\nF\ntemperature fluctuation caused the\napparent positions of peaks to change\nby about 20 increments of position. According to estimates based on the\nshapes of the peaks such a shift would\nreduce the apparent intensities of the\nNASA T~h RriAff;\n\nAII()II~t\n\n1994\n\nLL\n\n0\n\n73\n\n!!f\n:::l\n\n~\n\ncD\n\n72\n\n9,\'\n\n8\n\ncD\n\nf0-\n\n71\n\nE\n0\n0\n\nCI:\n\n70\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n\ncD\n\nOl\n\nc:\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n30\n\n\'0\ncD\n\nc:\n\ni:i:7.i\n\n:c\n\n.~\n(f) cD\n0>\n\n20\n10\n\nc:\n\n<ll\n\n.r:\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n...x\n~\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n\n0\n\n50\n100\n150\nSample Number (Proportional to Time)\n\n200\n\nThe Shifts in the Apparent Positions of Several Ka.

Knowledge of\ngrain- and pore-size distributions and of\nfiber orientation is important because\nthese characteristics are directly related\nto tensile strength, hardness, fracture\ntoughness, fracture stress, and resistance to impact. One of these combinations of techniques can be used in\nnondestructive evaluation of composite\nparts; both play important roles in the\ndevelopment of lightweight composites\nfor use at high temperatures in advanced\nengines and aircraft, for example.\n\nL..J\n\nThe first combination of techniques,\nknown as tone-pulse encoding, is applied to a photomicrograph of a metallographically prepared specimen (see Figure 1). The image is projected into a\nvideo camera of 512x512 pixels and digitized. The image data are processed to\nsuppress noise and to enhance the\nboundaries of the grains and pores of\ninterest. Next, the image data are processed via the tone-pulse algorithm,\nwhich encodes a pattern of spatial frequencies characteristic of the grains:\nscanning radially outward from the center of the image in all directions, a tone\npulse that begins and ends at the radially inner and outer boundaries of each\ngrain or pore is assigned to that grain.\n\nThe width of each pulse equals the width\nof the grain or pore, and the amplitude of\nthe pulse is inversely proportional to the\nwidth of the grain.\nThe encoded image is processed with\nthe help of Fourier transforms. The net\nresults of the processing are (1) data on\nP(r; <1\xc2\xbb, the density of components of\nlength r \' oriented at angle <1>, and (2) a\npicture of the mean grain or pore shape\ncomputed from P(r, <1\xc2\xbb .\nThe second combination of techniques, known as precision acoustic\nimaging, incorporates precision acoustic\nscanning, which has been in use for\nseveral years. The principal application is\nin making images of variations in porosity produced during sintering.

The principal advantage of\nAPSS is that, unlike x-radiography and prior ultrasonic techniques,\nit can reveal subtle distributions of microstructural features; e.g.,\nvariations in densities of micropores or regions in which fibers\nand matrices are poorly bonded to each other. Potential applications include the development and characterization of compositematerial components of large structures, such as buildings and\nbridges; determination of quality and detection of damage in\nfiberglass hulls, surfboards, ladders, and scaffolds; and development of porous prosthetic skins and complicated "smart" materials.\nThe underlying concept and measurement procedure of APSS\nare similar to optical diffraction measurements as well as the\nmeasurements that are made to determine the radiation pattems\nof radio antennas. In each of these cases, one extracts information\nabout a radiating or scattering (reflecting, diffracting, and/or refracting) source from the angular distribution of the density of scattered\npower measured at a specified distance from the source.\nIn this case, an uttrasonic transmitter aims an acoustic beam\n49\n\nComposite\nPanel\n\nare refracted at gradients in the density of\nmicropores. The resulting angular distribution of power density is asymmetrical.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The interaction between ultrasound\nand parallel fibers is analogous to the\ndiffract ion of light through slits ; the\nstrength of the interaction increases\nwhere fibers are poorly bonded to the\nmatrix. The resulting power-density pattem is symmetrical about the projection of\nthe axes of the fibers onto a plane perpendicular to the axis of the incident\nbeam .\nThe lower part of the figure gives an\nexample of the angular distribution of\npower density for a laminated composite\npanel in which fibers are oriented along\nthe x axis in half the layers and along the y\naxis in the other layers. The constantpower-density contours should be fourfold symmetrical about the axis of the incident beam (z axis). A uniform increase in\nporosity throughout the panel would\nincrease the diameter, 0, of the circularly\nsymmetrical component of the plot of\npower density as a function of the polar\nangle, <\\> . A uniform weakening of the\nfiber/matrix bonds would cause the experimentally measured fourfold-symmetrical\ncomponent to expand outward with\nrespect to the normalized maximum power\nat = O. A gradient in the porosity would\ngive rise to an asymmetrical component,\nas indicated by the dotted curve.\nThis work was done by Edward R.\nGenerazio of Lewis Research Center.\nFurther information, may be found in NASA\nTM-102561 [N90-23754}, "Theory and\nExperimental Technique for Nondestructive\nEvaluation of Ceramic Composites.

The measurements are indicative of internal structural features of the panel\nat that spot.\n\ne\n\n(typical frequency 10 to 50 MHz) at a spot\non the panel to be inspected, and a receiver remains aimed radially toward the spot\nwhile it is scanned over a hemisphere to\nmeasure the angular distribution of the\ndensity of scattered power (see figure). An\narray of transducers may also be used to\nmeasure this scattered power. A through\ntransmission configuration is shown in the\nfigure. A single sided backscatter configuration may also be used. To inspect the\nwhole panel , it is necessary to repeat this\nangular scan at many overlapping spots\ncovering the entire surface. The interac-\n\ntions between the incident beam and the\npanel can be summarized as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Micropores are distributed throughout a typical fiber/matrix composite; in\nthe absence of other effects, the\nsuperposition of sound waves diffracted\nfrom the micropores should yield an\nangular distribution of power density that\nis circularly symmetrical about the axis of\nthe beam.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The velocity of sound in a porous\nmaterial is proportional to its density,\nwhich varies with the distribution of\nmicropores.

Th is Crude Terrain-Height Plot was generated partly from\ncrosstalk data according to the scheme described in the text.\n\neach resolution cell. As explained below, each resolution cell\nconsists of an n x n (typically, 8 x 8) group of contiguous pixels.\nThus, this scheme yields data from which one can construct a\nlow-resolution topographical map of the terrain.\nThe scheme for estimating elevation angles is based on the\nobservation that the relative amplitude and phase of crosstalk\nbetween the horizontal and vertical polarization channels of the\ntransmitting and receiving equipment is a property of the equipment itself. As such, the crosstalk can be represented by two\ncomplex parameters (01 and 02) that are independent of the radar\nbackscatter signal and depend only on the angular deviation of the\nline of sight to the target from the nominal main axis of the radar\nbeam. Provided that some customary simplifying assumptions are\nsatisfied , 01 and 02 are two of six unknowns that can be computed by iterative solution of six equations. The input data for\nthese equations are sums or averages, over the resolution cell, of\nproducts of polarimetric backscatter measurements expressed in\ncomplex-number form.\nData that show the dependence of 01 and 02 on elevation\nangle are computed from calibration SAR scans that are performed at a known altitude over known , preferably flat terrain.\nPolynomial reference curves are fitted to these data. Figure 1 presents an example of two such reference curves. One or more of\nthe reference curves can be used to generate a lookup table in\nelectronic memory, which can thereafter be used to determine the\nelevation angles of resolution cells in SAR images from the values\nof 01 and 02 computed from the SAR data from those cells.\nFigure 2 shows a crude terrain-height map generated with\nthe help of this scheme from an SAR scan of part of Death\nValley, Califomia. The terrain includes a mountainous area that\nslopes down to alluvial fans. This low-resolution map does not\nshow the high-spatial-frequency variations in the altitude of the terrain in the mountainous area, but it does conform fairly well to the\nlarge-scale relief of the terrain .\nThis work was done by Anthony Freeman of Caltech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

This\ninvolves (1) reacting an aromatic diamine\nwith an equimolar amount of aromatic dianhydride (or optionally in slightly unequal\namounts with a small amount of an endcapping agent) at room temperature in a\nsolvent to obtain a polyamic acid resin,\n(2) casting the resin as a film or applying it\nas a coating, and (3) thermally curing the\nfilm or coating at a temperature between\n\n250 and 300\xc2\xb0C to convert it to the final\npolyimide form. The silver trifluoroacetylacetonate can be added to the reaction\nmixture or to the intermediate product\npolyamic acid resin.\nThe aromatic dian hydride used to\nmake each of the experimental conductive polyimides was either 3,3\',4,4\'-benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride\n(BTDA) or pyromellitic dian hydride\n(PMDA); the diamine in each case was\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\neither 4,4\'-oxydianiline (4,4\'-ODA) or 2,2[4(4-aminophenoxy)phenyl]hexafluoropropane (4-BDAF); and the solvent in each\ncase was N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc).\nOther dian hydrides that might also prove\nsuitable include 4,4\'-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA), 4,4\'-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy) diphenytsulfide dianhydride (BDSDA),\n2,2\'-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dian hydride (BFDA), 1,4-bis (3,4dicarboxyphenoxy) benzene dian hydride,\nand 3,4,3\'4\'-biphenyt tetracarboxylic dianhydride.

However, recent\nattempts to deposit thin films of c-BN\nfrom chemical vapors at pressures low\nenough to be practical have met with\nlimited success. The c-BN contents of\nBN films deposited experimentally at low\npressures have been estimated to be 10\npercent at most. This has been attributed to the fact that c-BN is thermodynamically metastable under normal\natmospheric conditions. Heretofore, neither the use of auxiliary gas (e.g., atomic\nhydrogen) during deposition nor the epitaxial forces exerted by substrates with\nmatched crystalline lattices could be\nrelied upon to stabilize the metastable cBN surfaces.\nHowever, the combination of (1) the\nclose match between the crystalline lattices of diamond (lattice constant = 3.567\nA) and c-BN (lattice constant = 3.616 A)\nand (2) the compatibility of the\nchemistries of these two materials is exNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\npected to enable the chemical vapor deposition of c-BN on an interlayer of polycrystalline diamond film, according to the\nproposal. Diamond has been grown on\nsingle-crystal c-BN that was synthesized\nat high pressure, and techniques for the\ngrowth of strongly adherent diamond\nfilms with different microstructures on\nmetals, semiconductors, and insulators\nare well established.\n\nPolycrystalline c-BN\n\nPolycrystallineDiamond\n\nPolycrystalline Cubic Boron Nitride would\nbe deposited on a substrate by use of a poly-\n\ncrystalline diamond interlayer.\n\nAs an example of the proposed approach, a popular tool-bit material that\nconsists of 6 percent cobalt in tungsten\ncarbide would be coated with c-BN in\nthe following process: First, cobalt would\nbe etched away from the surface by use\nof nitric acid. (It would be necessary to do\nthis because cobalt on the surface would\ntend to catalyze the formation of soot\nduring deposition). The etched surface\nwould be rubbed with diamond powder of\nsubmicron particle size to promote nucleation of diamond. A thin buffer layer of\namorphous silicon would then be deposited to promote adhesion of the diamond.\n\nNext, the diamond interlayer would be\ndeposited from a mixture of 0.5 to 2\npercent methane in hydrogen at a rate of\nflow of 100 to 500 standard cm 3/min, a\ntemperature of 600 to 1,000 \xc2\xb0c, a pressure of 40 to 100 torr (about 5 to 13\nkPa), a filament temperature of 2,000 K\n(if a hot filament is used to assist\ngrowth), and a power of 400 to 700 W at\na frequency of 2.45 GHz (for microwave\nplasma growth). Finally, c-BN would be\ndeposited on the diamond film by, for\nexample, chemical vapor deposition, enhanced by electron-cyclotron-resonance\nmicrowave plasma (400 to 700 W at\n2.45 GHz), from a mixture of 0.5 to 1.5\npercent B2H6 in nitrogen at a rate of\nflow of 50 to 100 standard cm 3/min, a\ntemperature of 400 to 700\xc2\xb0C, and a\npressure of 0.5 to 10 mtorr (about 0.07\nto 1.3 Pal, and a microwave power of\n400 to 700 W. A bombardment by ions\nat low energy may be needed to promote the nucleation and growth of the cBN: such bombardment could be\naccomplished easily by use of dc or\nradio-frequency bias.\nThis work was done by Tiong P.

The chamber is\ndesigned to replace an older silicide-coated combustion chamber in a small rocket\nengine. The older chamber, which represented the state of the art at the time of its\ndevelopment, could operate at a maximum temperature of about 1,400 \xc2\xb0c with\nfilm cooling. The newer chamber makes it\npossible to take advantage of a uniform\nstoichiometric combustion process that\nis hotter and more efficient than the older\ncombustion process is. Modified versions\nof the newer chamber could be designed\n\nfor use on Earth in gas turbines, ramjets,\nand scramjets.\nIridium and rhenium have the requisite\nhigh melting temperatures. However, rhenium is so hard and brittle that it cannot be\ndrawn to desired shapes, and it is very\ndifficult to machine it. The iridium-coated\nrhenium combustion chamber is fabricated in net shape by chemical-vapor deposition (even complicated net shapes can\nbe produced by this technique).\nThe iridium-coated rhenium combustion chamber was demonstrated in 2 h\nof operation as a thrustor and 17 h of operation at temperatures between 2,ooO \xc2\xb0C\n\nand 2,260\xc2\xb0C, including 105 starts. The\nnew, higher-efficiency combustion process\nmade possible by the iridium-coated rhenium chamber requires less fuel to produce a given performance: For example,\nthe estimated reduction in the mass of\npropellant needed for a contemplated\nspacecraft mission to an asteroid would\nbe 600 kg.\nThis work was done by Steven J.\nSchneider of Lewis Research Center,\nRobert H.

In each case , the wire made two\npasses through the OMCVD reactor. Typical deposition conditions in the reactor\nincluded a temperature of 500 \xc2\xb0C (maintained by use of quartz heating lamps)\nand a winding speed of 6 to 12 ft/h (0.5 to\n1 mm/s). The organometallic compounds\nthat contained Bi and Sr were fed into\nthe reactor by Ar (as a carrier gas) flowing\nthrough heated bubblers.

Unacceptably high concentrations of contaminants were taken as indications that\nthe rinsed parts should be recleaned. In\nthe new (water-based) method, a part to\nbe tested is immersed in water and subjected to ultrasonic energy for 10 minutes. Even though water is not a solvent\nfor grease, the ultrasound removes the\ngrease from the part and emulsifies the\n\ngrease into the water.

An aqueous alkaline electrolyte carries current, in the form of\nhydroxide ions (OH-), from cathode to anode. 0 2 is generated at the anode, passes through the porous anode material,\nand is collected. Hydrogen is generated at\nthe cathode, depositing on its surface as\nions (H+), which combine with palladium\natoms to form a palladium hydride (PdH)\ntransition complex. The hydrogen ions diffuse through the solid metal cathode by\nrepeatedly associating with and dissociating from Pd atoms in the crystal lattice.\nWhen the hydrogen ions reach the outside\nedge of the cathode, they combine to\nform gaseous H2, which is collected. The\ncathode transmits hydrogen effiCiently. In\nthe endurance test, the amount of H2 produced was 93.7 percent of the theoretical\nvalue based on the amount of electrical\ncharge transferred.\nBecause there is a solid metal barrier- the palladium cathode - between\nthe 02 and H2 collection compartments,\nthe collection compartments can be operated at different pressures.

The alloy is\ndesigned for use in the presence of high\nheat fluxes and active cooling; for example, in heat exchangers in advanced aircraft and spacecraft engines, and other\nhigh-temperature applications in which\nthere is need for a material that has high\nthermal conductivity, high strength, and\nresistance to creep. In addition, the high\nconductivity and hardness of the alloy\ncould be exploited in welding electrodes\nand in high-voltage and high-current switches and other applications in which wear\nposes a design problem .\nPrepared by rapid solidification of a\nmolten solution of Cr and Nb in Cu, the\nalloy consists of a finely precipitated\nstrengthening phase of Cr2Nb in a phase\nthat is mostly Cu. Because both Cr and\nNb have very little solubility in solid Cu, the\nthermal conductivity of the alloy is only\nslightly less than that of pure Cu. The\nCr2Nb precipitate has a high melting temperature and is highly stable at high temperatures: this leads to long-term stability of\nthe mechanical properties of the alloy during exposure to high temperatures. Thus,\nthe alloy provides the desired combination of high thermal conductivity, high\nstrength, and resistance to creep.\nFigure 1 compares the tensile strength\nand the ductility of this Cu/8Cr/4Nb alloy\nwith those of the commercial alloys\nNARloy-Z and GUDCOP AL-15. The ultimate tensile strength of this alloy is significantly greater than that of NARloy-Z\nbetween room temperature and 700\xc2\xb0C.\nSoftening of the NARloy-Z begins around\n500\xc2\xb0C, as shown in short-term tensile\ntests, and can become severe with longterm exposures because of coarsening\nof the strengthening phases in NARloy-Z.\nThis limits the maximum use temperature\nof NARloy-Z. In comparison, tests have\nshown little decrease in the room -temperature strength of Cu/8Cr/4Nb samples\naged for up to 100 h at 700\xc2\xb0C.\nThe yield strength of Cu/8Cr/4Nb is\ncomparable to that of GUDCOP AL-15,\nbut the principal advantage of Cu/8Cr/\n4Nb over GUDCOP AL-15 is that Cu/8Cr/\n4Nb has about twice the ductility at eleNASA Tech Briefs, Auqust 1994\n\n450.0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nYield Strength of\nCulSCr/4Nb\n\n--0--\n\n400.0\n\nUltimate Tensile\nStrength of\nCulSCr/4Nb\n\nttl\nCl.\n\n:2\n\xc2\xa3\n\n- -0-- Yield Strength of\nNARloy-Z\n\nc;,\n\n-\n\nc:\n~\n\nU5\n\n-.\n_... . . .,{),. -\n\n50.0\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n600\nTemperature,O\nC\n\nUltimate Tensile\nStrength of\nNARloy-Z\nYield Strength of\nGLiDCOP AL-15\nUltimate Tensile\nStrength of\nGLiDCOP AL-15\n\nSOO\n\nSO.O\n--0--\n\nElongation of\nCulSCr/4Nb\nReduction in Area\nof Cu/SCr/4Nb\n\nC\n\nC1>\n\n- -0-- Elongation of\n\n~\n\nC1>\n\n..\n\nCl.\n\n~\n\nNARloy-Z\n\n- --\n\nReduction in Area of\nNARloy-Z\n\n_ . .to . -\n\n\xc2\xb7\nu\nCl\n"\n\nElongation of\nGLiDCOP AL-15\nReduction in Area of\nGLiDCOP AL-15\n\n10.0\n0\n200\n\n0\n\nSOO\n\n400\n600\nTemperature,O\nC\n\nFigure 1.

Many\nvariations of the basic process conditions,\ningredients, and sequence of operations\nare possible, and not all the resulting versions of the process yield electrically conductive films.\nThe first step in the process is to prepare\na solution of poIyamic acid in a polar organic solvent. (The polyamic acid is to be thermally polymerized in a subsequent step to\nobtain the desired polyimide.) Typically, this\npreparation involves the addition of an\nequimolar quantity of a suitable dianhydride to an equimolar quantity of a suitable diamine dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Dianhydrides that have\nbeen used in experiments include 2,2bis(3,4-dicarboxypheny1)hexafluoropropane\ndianhydride (6FDA), 3,3\',4,4\'-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dian hydride (BTDA),\nand 1 ,4-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)benzene\ndianhydride (HQDEA). Diamines that have\nbeen used indude 4,4\'-oxydianiline (4,4\'ODA), 2 ,2-bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyQhexafluoropropane (4-BDAF), 2,2-bis(3aminophenyl)hexafluoropropane (6F), and\n1 ,3-bis(aminophenoxy)benzene (APB) .\nThe second step in the process is to\nadd a soluble salt or complex that contains\n\nPolyimide\n(See text for definitions.)\n\ngold; the preferred additive - the only one\ntried thus far that yields conductive films is tetrachloroauric QII) acid. This ingredient is\nadded after the polyamic acid polymerization has gone to completion. Because\ntetrachloroauric (III) acid is hygroscopic, it\nshould be dried before adding it to the\npolyamic acid solution, and the addition\nshould be performed in a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain best results. Although various concentrations of gold additive were\ntested and resulted in metallic film surfaces, a minimum molar concentration of\n17 percent (with respect to the molar concentration of polyimide), averaged over the\nfull volume of a given cured polyimide film,\nwas found to be necessary to obtain an\nelectrically conductive film surface.\nThe third step in the process is to cast\nthe gold-doped polymeric solution onto a\nflat, level substrate of soda lime glass, aluminum, stainless steel, polytetrafluoroethylene, or other suitable material in sufficient\nquantity to obtain a final film thickness of\nabout 1 mil (0.025 mm). In the fourth step,\nthe cast film is thermally imidized by forcedair heat ing at temperatures of 10acC,\n20acC, and 30(J\'C, holding at each temperature for 1 h. During this curing process,\nthe gold ions are reduced to metallic gold\nand incorporated into a gold layer on the\nsurface exposed to the air.\n\nPercent Gold in Film\n\nThe amount of solvent used in preparing\nthe gold-doped polyamic acid solution\nneed only be sufficient to dissolve all the\ningredients and to provide a viscosity suitable for film casting. The success of the\nprocess depends partly on the solubility of\nthe gold additive in the polyamic acid solution, though solubility alone does not guarantee the desired results. The best results\nwere obtained with the BTDA/4-BDAF,\nBTDA/4,4\'-ODA, 6FDA/ 4,4\'-ODA, and\nBTDA/6F resin systems.\nThese metallic gold-containing polyimides can be used in film and coating\napplications requiring electrical conductivity, high reflectivity, exceptional thermal stability, and/or mechanical integrity.

If the end product is to be a composite, then preforms\ncontaining fibers are used. Products can be formed in complex\nshapes. They are fully dense, with controlled microstructures and tailored thermomechanical properties. Products have been made in\nthe following compositions:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Silicon carbide containing silicon (see figure),\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Silicon carbide containing molybdenum disilicide and silicon,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Silicon carbide containing niobium disilicide and silicon, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A composite material consisting of a silicon carbide matrix reinforced by silicon carbide fibers.\nSilicon carbide ceramics and composites made by reactive melt\ninfiltration can be used, for example, in combustor liners of jet\nengines and in nose cones and leading edges of high-speed aircraft\nand returning spacecraft. In the energy industry, these materials\ncan be used in radiant-heater tubes, heat exchangers, heat recuperators, and turbine parts. These materials are also well suited\nto the demands of advanced automobile engines.\nIn the nuclear industry, the nonporous nature of the materials\nmay qualify them for the first -wall and blanket components of\nreactors. In contrast, SiC/SiC composites made by CVI are about\n15 percent porous, and SiC-based materials contain sintering aids\n(such as boron), which swell when irradiated.\nYet another use is in armor. Although the fracture toughness of\nmonolithic silicon carbide is low, it can be increased by adding various phases, as can readily be done in reactive melt infiltration.\nFinally, the ability to produce parts in complex shapes and nearly\nfinal dimensions makes reactive melt infiltration suitable for the\nfabrication of silicon carbide cutting tools.\nThis work was done by Donald R.

The design must\nnot only be functionally accurate, but it must\nalso maintain the correct timing. After a\ncircuit has been laid out, one can utilize\nthe back-annotation (SA) method to simulate the design and obtain an accurate estimate of performance, However, this can\nlead to major design changes. It is therefore\npreferable to eliminate potential problems\nearly in this process. IFA, the Intelligent\nFront Annotation program, assists in verifying the timing of the ASIC early in the\ndesign process,\nMany difficulties can arise during ASIC\ndesign processes. In a synchronous design,\nboth long-path and short-path problems\ncan be present. In a modem ASIC, the delays through gates are very dependent on\nloading. This loading has two main components: the capacitance of the gates\nbeing driven and the capacitance of the\nmetal tracks (wires), When using GaAs gate\narrays, the capacitance of the metal lines is\noften the dominating factor. In addition, the\n\n60\n\nresistance-capacitance delay through a wire\nof submicron width is significant. Inasmuch\nas the lengths of wires are unknown before\nthey are placed on and routed across an\nentire circuit chip, these considerations\nwould seem to force the designer to postpone any realistic verification of timing until\nnear the end of the design process, and\nobviously such postponement is undesirable.\nThe IFA program estimates the delays in\nan ASIC before layout. Currently, the program is designed for Vitesse GaAs gate\narrays and Valid computer-aided-engineering workstations, but the algorithm is\nappropriate for ASIC\'s and computers of\nmany different types. IFA is especially useful for devices, the delays in which are\nextremely dependent on the interconnection wiring in them . IFA estimates the\nlengths of the interconnections from information supplied by the user and information\nin the netlist. The resulting lengths are also\nused to constrain a placement -and-routing\nprogram, ensuring reasonable results,\nIFA takes locality into account to give a\nbetter estimate of lengths of wires as well\nas such known factors as fanout and drive.\nAlthough the exact location of a cell is not\nknown, an estimate of the length of wire\ncan be calculated from the location of the\nnet in the ASIC-design-structure hierarchy.\nThe length of each net is estimated by use\nof the IFA program. This length is then\nused to run timing analysis or simulation on\nthe design, further using the delay values\nestimated by IFA. The length of each net is\nalso used to define constraints for the\nplacement-and-routing program, which uses\nthe constraints as limiting values, along\nwith floor-plan information, to assist the\nplacement.\nIFA is written in C language for Sunseries computers running SunOS.

Monte Carlo methods\nare used to generate failure and repair\ntimes of components represented by\nblocks in the diagram as fUnctions of\nexponential and/or Weibull distributions.\nThe ETARA computer program was written\nto evaluate the performance of the electrical power system of the Space Station\nFreedom, but the methodology and software can be applied to any system that\ncan be represented by a block diagram.\nETARA can calculate such availability\nparameters as equivalent availability, state\navailability (percentage of time at a particular output state capability) , continuous\nduration of a given state, and number of\noccurrences of a given state. The proNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\ngram can simulate the initial allotment of\nspare parts and the replenishment of\nspare parts on a resupply cycle. The numbers of failures of blocks are tabulated\nboth individually for each block and by\ntype of block. The total downtime, repair\ntime, and time waiting for spares are also\ntabulated. The number of technician-hours\nper year required for maintenance and\nthe reliability of the system, with or without\nrepair, at or above a particular output capability can also be calculated.\nETARA requires the development of a\nreliability or availability block diagram. The\nblock diagram is a logical representation of\nthe block configuration necessary for the\naccomplishment of a function. Each block\ncan represent a component, a subsystem,\nor a system that performs a function that\nmust be represented as either available\nor unavailable. The blocks do not have to\nbe physically connected equipment in the\nreal system to be connected in the block\ndiagram. The block need only have a role\nin contributing to the availability of the system. There are no restrictions on the number of total blocks or on the number of\nblocks in a series, parallel, or M-of-N parallel subsystem. In addition, the same\nblock can appear in more than one subsystem if such an arrangement is necessary for an accurate model.\nETARA version 3.3 was developed in\n1990.

Both algebraic and elliptic grid-generation systems are included.\nThe method for generation of a grid by\nalgebraic transformation is based on an interpolation algorithm, and the elliptic generation of a grid involves, among other\nthings, solving an elliptic partial differential\nequation (PDE).\nNonuniform grid distributions are carried\nout by use of a hyperbolic-tangent stretching function.

The\nalgebraic grids can subsequently be\nsmoothed by use of an elliptic-PDE-solving\nalgorithm. For an elliptic grid system, the\nPDE can be in the form of Laplace (zero\nforcing function) or Poisson.

Refer\nto MFS-28848.\n\nMathematics and\nInfonnation Sciences\nProgram Helps Decompose\nComplex Design Systems\n\nDeMAIO groups modular\nsubsystems on the basis\nof interactions among them.\nMany engineering systems are large\nand multidisciplinary. Before the design of\nsuch new complex systems as large platforms in outer space can begin, the possible\ninteractions among subsystems and their\nparts must be determined. Once this is done,\nthe proposed system can be decomposed\nto identify its hierarchical structure.\nThe DeMAID (A Design Manager\'s Aid\nfor Intelligent Decomposition) computer\nprogram is a knowledge-based software\nsystem for ordering the sequence of modules and identifying a possible multilevel\n\nstructure for the design problem. DeMAID\ndisplays the modules in the format of an N\nx N matrix (called a design structure\nmatrix). As used here, "module" denotes\nany process that requires input and generates an output. A module could also be\na process (e.g., an initialization process)\nthat generates an output but does not require an input. Although DeMAID requires\nan investment of time to generate and refine the list of modules for input, it could\nsave a considerable amount of money\nand time in the total design process, particularly in a new design problem in which\nthe order of the modules has not been\ndefined.\nThe decomposition of a complex design\nsystem into subsystems depends on the\njudgment of the design manager. DeMAID\nreorders and groups the modules on the\nbasis of the links (interactions) among the\nmodules, helping the design manager make\ndecomposition decisions early in the design\ncycle. The modules are grouped into circuits (the subsystems) and displayed in\nan N x N-matrix format. Feedback links,\nwhich indicate an iterative process, are\nminimized and occur only within a subsystem. Since there are no feedback links\namong the circuits, the circuits can be\ndisplayed in a multilevel format. Thus, a\nlarge amount of information is reduced to\none or two displays that are stored for\nlater retrieval and modification. The design\nmanager and leaders of the design teams\nthen have a visual display of the design\nproblem and the intricate interactions\namong the different modules.\nThe design manager could save a substantial amount of time if circuits on the\nsame level of the multilevel structure are\nexecuted in parallel. DeMAID estimates\nthe time saved on the basis of the number\nof available processors. In addition to decomposing the system into subsystems,\nDeMAID examines the dependencies of\na problem with independent variables and\ndependent functions. A dependency matrix is created to show the relationship.\nDeMAID is based on knowledge-base\ntechniques to provide flexibility and ease in\nadding new capabilities. Although DeMAID\nI,was originally written for design problems,\nit has proved to be very generally capable\nin solving any problem that contains modules (processes) that take inputs and generate outputs. For example, one group is\napplying DeMAID to gain understanding of\nthe flow of data associated with a very\nlarge computer program. In this example,\nthe modules are the subroutines of the\nprogram.\nThe design manager begins the design\nof a system by determining the level of\nmodules that must be ordered. The level is\nthe "granularity" of the problem. For example, the design manager may wish to\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nexamine disciplines (a coarse model), analysis programs, or the data level (a fine\nmOdeQ. Once the system is divided into\nthese modules, the input and output of\neach model is determined, creating a data file for input to the main program.\nDeMAID is executed through a system\nof menus. The user can choose to plan ,\nschedule, display the N x N matrix, display\nthe multilevel organization, or examine the\ndependency matrix. The main program\ncalls a subroutine that reads a rule file\nand a data file, asserts facts into the\nknowledge base, and executes the inference\nengine\nof\nthe\nartificial\nintelligence/expert systems program,\nCUPS (C Language Integrated Production\nSystem).\nTo determine the effects of changes in\nthe design process, DeMAID includes a\ntrace-effects feature. Two methods are\navailable to trace the effects of a change in\nthe design process. The first method\ntraces forward through the outputs to determine the effects of an output with respect to a change in a particular input.\nThe second method traces backward to\ndetermine what modules must be re-executed if the output of a module must be\nrecomputed.\nDeMAID is available in two machine versions: a Macintosh version written in\nSymantec\'s Think C 3.01 , and a Sun version written in C language. The Macintosh\nversion requires system software 6.0.2 or\nlater and CUPS 4.3. The source code for\nthe Macintosh version is not com pi lab Ie\nunder version 4.0 of Think C; however, a\nsample executable code is provided on\nthe distribution media.

Since neither\nmachine version is compatible with CUPS\n5.0 or later, the source code for CLIPS\n4.3 is included on the distribution media;\nhowever, the documentation for CLIPS\n4.3 is not included in the documentation\npackage for DeMAID.

This statistical method\ncan be used in place of MIL-STD-1 05E\nsampling plans when a minimum sample\nsize is desirable, such as when tests are\ndestructive or expensive. HYPERSAMP utilizes the hypergeometric distribution and\ncan be used for any fraction nonconforming. The program employs an iterative technique that circumvents the obstacle presented by the factorial of a nonwhole\nnumber . HYPERSAMP provides the\nrequired hypergeometric sample size for\nany equivalent real number of nonconformances in the lot or batch under evaluation.\nMany currently used sampling systems,\nsuch as the MIL-STD-105E, utilize the binomial or the Poisson equations to estimate the hypergeometric distribution when\nperforming inspection by attributes. However, this is primarily because of the difficulty\nin calculation of the factorials in the hypergeometric distribution. Sampling plans based\non the binomial or Poisson equations result\nin the maximum sample size possible with\nthe hypergeometric distribution.\nThe difference between the sample\nsizes in the Poisson or binomial cases on\nthe one hand and the hypergeometric\ncase on the other hand can be signifi cant. In the example of a lot of 400 devices with an error rate of 1.0 percent and\na confidence of 99 percent, a sample of\n400 (all units) would be needed for the\nbinomial-based sampling plan, and only\n273 for a hypergeometric-based sampling\nplan. The hypergeometric-based sampling\nplan saves 127 units - a significant\nreduction in the required sample size.\nHYPERSAMP is a demonstration program and is limited to sampling plans with\nzero defectives in the samples (acceptance number of zero). Since it is a demonstration program, the determination of\nsample sizes is limited to sample sizes of\n1,500 or less.\nThe Hypergeometric Attribute Sampling\nSystem demonstration code is a spreadsheet program written for IBM PC-compatible computers running DOS and Lotus\n\n1-2-3 or Quattro Pro.

The JPL AIRSAR system is a multipolarimetric airborne synthetic-aperture\nradar system developed and operated by\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It includes\na single-frequency L-band sensor mounted on the NASA CV990 aircraft and its\nreplacement, the multifrequency P-, L- ,\nand C-band sensors mounted on the\nNASA DC-S aircraft. MacSigmaO works\nwith data in the standard JPL AIRSAR\noutput-product format, which is the compressed Stokes-matrix format.\nERS-1 and JERS-1 are single-frequency, single-polarization spaceborne synthetic - aperture radar (SAR) systems\nlaunched by the European Space Agency\nand NASDA, respectively. To be usable by\nMacSigmaO, the data must have been\nprocessed at the Alaska SAR Facility and\nmust be in the "low-resolution" format.\nMagellan is a spacecraft mission to map\nthe surface of Venus with imaging radar.\nThe project is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The spacecraft carries a\n\nsingle-frequency, single-polarization SAR system. MacSigmaO works with frameiets of the\nstandard MIDR CD-ROM data products.\nMacSigmaO provides four basic functions: synthesis of images (if necessary),\nstatistical analysis of selected areas, analysis of corner reflectors as a calibration\nmeasure (if appropriate and possible), and\n\n63\n\ninformative mouse tracking. For instance,\nthe JPL AIRSAR data can be used to synthesize a variety of images such as a totalpower image. The total-power image displays the sum of the polarized and\nunpolarized components of the backscatter for each pixel. Other images that can\nbe synthesized are HH, HV, VV, RL, RR ,\nHHVV\', HHHV\', HVVV*, HHVV\' (where\nH, V, L, and R denote horizontal linear,\nvertical linear, left circular, and right circular polarization, respectively; one letter in\neach pair denotes the transmitting polarization, and the other letter in each pair\ndenotes the receiving polarization) phase\nand correlation-coefficient images. For the\ncomplex and phase images, phase is displayed by use of color, and magnitude is\ndisplayed by use of intensity.\nMacSigmaO can also be used to compute statistics from within a selected area.\nThe statistics computed depend on the\ntype of image. For JPL AIRSAR data, the\nHH, HV, VV, HHVV\' phase, and correlation-coefficient means and standard deviation measures are calculated. The mean,\nrelative standard deviation, minimum, and\nmaximum values are calculated for all\nother types of data. A histogram of data\npertaining to the selected area is also calculated and displayed. The shape of the\nselected area can be rectangular, linear, or\npolygonal. The user can select multiple\nrectangular areas, but not multiple linear or\npolygonal areas. The statistics and histogram are displayed to the user and can\nbe either printed or saved as a text file.\nMacSigmaO can also be used to analyze\ncorner reflectors as a measure of the calibration for data of the types produced by\nJPL AIRSAR, ERS-1, and JERS-1. It computes a theoretical radar cross section and\nthe actual radar cross section for a selected trihedral corner reflector. The theoretical\ncross section, the measured cross section, the ratio between them in decibels,\nand other information are displayed to the\nuser and can be saved into a text file.\nFor ERS-1 , JERS-1 , and Magellan data,\nMacSigrnaO simultaneously displays the\ncurrent location of the cursor in data coordinates and in latitude and longitude\ncoordinates.

The ability to tailor the\nproperties of a compOSite by the appropriate selection of its fiber and matrix constituents is a major advantage. The Micromechanical Combined Stress Analysis\n(MICSTRAN) computer code provides the\n\nmaterials engineer with an easy-to-use personal-computer-based software tool to calculate overall properties of a composite,\ngiven the properties of the fibers and matrix.\nTo assess the ability of the composite to\ncarry structural loads, the design engineer\nneeds to calculate the intemal stresses in\nthe composite. MICSTRAN can calculate\nsuch intemal stresses within a composite\nply under combined thermal and mechanical loading. It is based partly on the assumption that the fibers have a circular\ncross section and are arranged either in a\nrepeating square or diamond pattem within a ply. It uses a classical elasticity solution\ntechnique and has been demonstrated to\ncalculate stresses accurately.\nInput to MICSTRAN consists of such\ntransversely isotropic fiber properties and\nisotropic matrix properties as moduli of\nelasticity and rigidity, Poisson\'s ratios, and\ncoefficients of thermal expansion, plus volume fractions of fibers and matrix. Loading\ninput consists of a temperature change\nand ply stresses. All six stress components\ncan be specified as input to analyze a complete three-dimensional stress state in a ply.\nOutput consists of overall thermoelastic\nconstants and stresses. Computed stresses that can be requested as outputs include those along the fiber/matrix interface, along the model boundaries, along\ncircular arcs, or at pOints specified by the\nuser and located anywhere in the model.\nThe MICSTRAN program takes advantage of the MicroSoft WINDOWS graphical\nuser interface program.\nMICSTRAN is written in FORTRAN 77 for\nIBM PC-series and compatible computers\nrunning MS-DOS. This program is designed\nto run on MicroSoft WINDOWS 3.0 or later\nand contains calls to the MicroSoft\nQuickWin libraries that are available with\nMicroSoft FORTRAN v5.1.

The adjustable deflector enables\nthe system to scan along an additional axis\nthat can be perpendicular (z axis) or tilted\n(z\' axis) with respect to the y axis. For example, with the help of the adjustable deflector, the system can execute a recti linear raster scan of an inclined surface\nlike that of an I beam that is tilted with\nrespect to the y axis of the x-y translation\nstage. Thus, modifying a two-dimensional\nscanner by equipping it with the adjustable\ndeflector is an economical alternative to\ninstallation of a more-complicated scanning mechanism that may have three translational and two rotational degrees of freedom.\nFigure 1 illustrates the use of the ad justable deflector in scanning an angled\nplate or beam specimen that is oriented\nwith one of its axes along the x axis of\nthe translation stage and is tilted to angle\na with respect to the y axis. The deflector is immersed, along with the speci men , in a tank of water or other ultrasound -coupling med ium . The incident\nand return ultrasonic beams are vertical\n(they propagate along the z axis) at the\nultrasonic probe, which is mounted on\nthe x-y translation stage. (Alternatively,\nthe tank can be mounted on the translation stage.) A typical motor-driven x-y\ntranslation stage for an ultrasonic system\nalso includes a manual z-axis adjust ment.\nTo obtain a valid C-scan image, it is\nnecessary to make the incident and retum\nultrasonic beams perpendicular to the surface of the specimen at the spot being\nscanned . In this case, the angles of incidence and reflection needed to satisfy\nthis condition are obtained by orienting\nthe deflector with one of its axes oriented\nalong the x axis and tilting its other axis to\nan angle f3 = Y2 (a + It) with respect to the\ny axis. With the adjustable deflector thus\noriented, motion of the ultrasonic probe (or\nof the tank) along the x axis produces an\nultrasonic C-scan axis line image of the\nspecimen, while an increment of motion\nalong the y axis (as in moving to the next\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nz\nUltrasonic\nProbe\n\n9 = 1t - J3\n13 =1/2 (1t + a )\n\nz\'\n\n.. - - - -,\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n1- ____ _\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nx Axis Into Page\n\n...-t------- Y\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n\\\n\\\n\n\\\n\\\n\n\\\n\\\n\n/\n\nAngled Specimen\n(Tilted I Beam)\n\nFigure 1.

Thus, the standard x-y scan has been converted to an\nx-z\' scan.\nFigure 2 illustrates a sun-and-planetarygear mechanism that can be used to adjust the deflector. The deflector should\nhave a fine surface finish and should be\nmade of a material (e.g., glass) that has a\nhigh acoustic impedance in comparison\nwith water. The length of the deflector\nalong the x axis should be at least the\nlength of the scan , and the height of the\ndeflector should be at least equal to that of\nthe specimen .\n\nThis work was done by E.

The electromagnets provide active control of the position of the\nshaft. This bearing can operate at temperatures from -320 O (-196 0c) to 650 O\nF\nF\n(343 \xc2\xb0C); it is designed for possible use\nin rocket-engine turbopumps, where the\neffects of the cryogenic environment and\nfluid severely limit the lubrication of conventional ball bearings. This and similar\nbearings are also suitable for terrestrial\nrotating machinery; for example, gas-turbine engines , high-vacuum pumps,\ncanned pumps, precise gimbals that suspend sensors , and pumps that handle\ncorrosive or gritty fluids.\nThe flux from the permanent magnets\nfollows a magnetic circuit that goes\nthrough the shaft, providing a bias flux\nthat serves to make the force proportional to current. The flux from the electromagnets also goes through the shaft,\nproviding for alteration of the net magnetic force on the shaft. The lateral deviation\nof the shaft from a central or other designated position is measured by precise,\nrapidly responding position sensors. The\nposition data are processed by an\nassociated electronic control system,\nwhich commands the application of power\nto the electromagnets to generate appropriate lateral forces to restore the shaft to\nthe designated position.\nThe design of the bearing also includes\nthe following notable features:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The magnetic field and circuit have a\nhomopolar configuration, which suppresses eddy-current losses.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The overall electromechanical design\ntakes account of resonances; for ex-\n\nz\nShaft\n\nFlux From\n\n~~*~:m~ Electromagnet\n\nFlux\nElectromagnet\nfor X Force\n\nFerromagnetic Rotor\nSleeve\nTarget\n\nThe Cryogenic Hybrid Magnetic Bearing provides noncontact suspension and active control of the position of the shaft.\n\nample, the control system includes filters\nfor use in tuning through critical frequencies.\nThe cryogenic hybrid magnetic bearing\noffers several advantages over the most\nnearly equivalent commercial magnetic\nbearing : Its optimized magnetic circuit\nreduces eddy-current heating and losses\nby a factor of more than 10, enabling operation at greater speeds without compromising the structural integrity of the shaft.\n\nIts control circuitry is much smaller and\nconsumes much less power than does\nthe control circuitry of the commercial unit.\nIts weight is less than that of the commercial unit.\nThis work was done by Crawford R.\nMeeks of AVCON and Eliseo DiRusso\nand Gerald V.

The window is used\nin experiments that involve the optical\nobservation (e.g., Raman scattering of a\nlaser beam) of processes in the chamber.\n\n66\n\nThe valve mechanism is activated by\npressure from gas leaking through the\nwindow. The mechanism includes a piston\nconnected through a crank linkage to a\n90\xc2\xb0 plug valve. The piston rides in a cylinder, the axis of which is concentric with\nthe window (see figure). The housing that\ncontains the mechanism also contains the\n\nsource of light and other optical and electronic components used to observe\nthrough the window. The electrical connections for these components pass\nthrough sealed fittings in the wall of the\nhousing to the outside.\nIf gas leaks from a crack in the window, pressure builds up inside the housNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\ning. When the pressure is high enough to\novercome the friction on the piston, the\npiston moves away from the window, tuming the crank and thereby closing the plug\nvalve, which seals the window and the\npressure vessel against further leakage.\nThe housing does not have to withstand the full pressure in the vessel only the relatively low pressure needed to\nstart the piston moving. It therefore can be\nrelatively small, lightweight, and thin walled .\nThis work was done by E. J. McCoomb\nof United Technologies Corp. for Marshall Space Flight Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe mechanical device shown in the\nfigure couples two shafts called the "upper\nshaft" and the "mounting shaft," while limiting the torsional and bending loads that\ncan be transmitted between them. A\nbending moment in the upper shaft is\ntransmitted to the wobble plate, which,\nin response, pivots at a point of contact\nbetween its rounded edge and the inside\nof the lip at the upper end of the outer\nhousing. This pivoting action forces the\nthrust pin downward against the spring plate,\nthereby compressing the Belleville springs.\nThe springs absorb the bending moment and tend to restore the wobble plate\nto its Original position. The Belleville springs\ncan be preloaded - that is, they can be\ncompressed by a preset amount when\nthe coupling is assembled - so that the\ndevice transmits a bending moment until it\nexceeds a preset limit.\nTorsional moment in the upper shaft is\ntransmitted to the outer housing through\nserrations (not shown in the figure) in the\nedge of the wobble plate that mate with\nserrations in the lip of the outer housing.\nThe outer housing is directly attached to\nthe ball housing, which contains springloaded balls that ride on a cammed outer\nsurface of the mounting shaft. The force of\nthe springs on the balls tends to drive\nthem down the ramps of the cammed\nsurface so that they resist the circumferential displacement caused by the torsional moment. The ball springs can also\nbe preloaded , allowing transmission of a\npreset torsional moment before they slip\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\npast the tops of the cammed surfaces\nand thereby relieve the torsional moment.\nThis work was done by Thomas R.\nOoebbler and Preston E. Kent of Lock-\n\nheed Engineering & Sciences Co. for\nJohnson Space Center. For further information, write in 32 on the TSP\nRequest Card.

Both sets of springs can be adjusted so as not to relieve loads below preset limits.\n\n67\n\nPositioning Fixture for Survey Antenna\nAn adapter keeps a GPS antenna level at a fixed height.\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nAn improved positioning fixture is designed to simplify and accelerate the accurate alignment of an antenna for use in\na land survey aided by satellites of the\nGlobal Positioning System. The fixture\nholds the antenna at a fixed height and\norientation over a station monument so\nthat survey measurements can be made\nwith accuracy and precision.\nPreviously, a technician had to set up\na standard tripod and associated fixtures - a painstaking and time-consuming chore for an inexperienced technician. Moreover, the setup alignment\ncould easily be lost without the technician\'s knowledge.\nThe improved positioning fixture includes an adapter that fits on a standard survey tripod, plus a fixed-height\nrod. These components are used to center and level the antenna (see figure). To\nuse the fixture, the technician follows\nthese steps:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Set up the tripod so that it is approximately centered over the monument;\nneither the adapter nor the tripod head\nhas to be level at this point.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Insert the rod into the central hole of\nthe adapter.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Insert the lower tip of the rod into the\ncenter of the benchmark on the monument.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Loosen four thumbscrews on the\nadjustable x-y slider assembly (which is\npart of the adapter), and adjust the slider plate until the rod is vertical, as indicated by a bubble level on the rod .\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tighten the thumbscrews .\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Slowly rotate the rod through a full\ncircle. The bubble should stay centered.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If the bubble drifts from center during rotation, adjust two of the three\nscrews on the bottom of the bubble\nlevel, and rotate the rod again.

ZSRM \'s\nare used to minimize mechanical interactions between supports and structures\nunder test, so that the vibrational, rotational, and translational characteristics of\nthe structures can be measured accurately, with minimal spurious dynamics\nintroduced via the supports.\nUnlike some older ZSRM\'s, this suspension mechanism does not include overhead cables , which necessitate large\namounts of overhead clearance and overhead support structures: this suspension\nmechanism is more compact (it can be\nmuch smaller than the structure) and\nsupports the structure from below. In\ncomparison with most older ZSRM \'s, this\none provides a wider range of relatively\nunconstrained motion in some degrees of\nfreedom . The major structural members\nof this mechanism can be made of lightweight composite (e.g., graphite-fiber/\nepoxy) materials to reduce further its\neffects on the overall dynamics. In addition , this mechanism is simple and can\nbe constructed easily.\nAs shown at the bottom of the figure ,\npressurized air is supplied via a flexible\nhose to the base of the suspension mechanism. The air bleeds out through holes on\nthe bottom surface of the base, forming\nan air cushion that minimizes the frictional resistance to horizontal motion.\nThus, the suspension mechanism allows\nessentially unconstrained translation along\nthe x and y axes and rotation about the z\naxis.\nThe mechanism includes a coupling\nrod attached to the test structure via a\nthreaded rod. A support plate at the top\nof the mechanism includes a large hole\n(hidden in the figure) that allows a fairly\nwide range of horizontal motion of the\nupper end of the coupling rod .

This system is related to the one described in "Ultrasonic System Measures Elastic Properties of Composites" (NPO-18729), NASA\nTech Briefs , Vol. 17, No. 11 (November\n1993), pages 76-77. The tests performed\nwith this system are nondestructive, and\nthey involve access by ultrasonic probes\nto only one side of a material specimen. In\ncomparison with some other available\nultrasonic testing systems, this system is\nrelatively inexpensive, and it is based on a\ntesting technique that is Simpler and rapidly yields more-accurate results.\nThis system (see figure) is controlled by\na personal computer, which also processes the measurement data. The specimen is immersed in a tank of water along\nwith a transmitting and a receiving ultrasonic transducer. The positions and orientations of the transducers relative to\nthe specimen are controlled to obtain the\ndesired polar angle of the incident ultrasonic beam relative to the orientation of\nthe fibers and to maintain the angle of\nmeasured reflection equal to the angle of\nincidence.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nTwo sequences of measurements are\ntaken on a given specimen . First, one of\nthe transducers is set to function as both\na transmitter and receiver at normal incidence, and pulse/echo time-of-flight measurements are taken to determine the speed\nof bulk waves propagating through the\nlaminate. Next, the two transducers are set\nto operate in pitch/catch mode at various\nangles of incidence and reflection and various polar angles with respect to the fibers:\nthe resulting measurement data include\ntimes of flight (equivalently, speeds of\npropagation) and critical angles for total\nreflection .\nFor the purpose of analysis, the composite specimen is assumed to be an ideal\ntransversely isotropic material , which can\nbe characterized by five independent constants that represent aspects of its elasticity at various orientations. Equations that\nexpress the relationships among the five\nconstants , the mass density of the material, the critical angles, and the speeds of\npropagation at various angles, are incorporated into a program that is executed on the computer.

Aspects of the spatial-operator-algebra approach have been\ndescribed in several previous articles in\nNASA Tech Briefs - most recently "Robot\nControl Based on Spatial-Operator Algebra"\n(NPO-17918), Vol. 16, No.9, (1992) page\n115. The present method unifies the analysis for the rigid- and flexible-link cases in a\nmore-general version of the spatial-operator algebra that accommodates the complexity of the dynamics, yet promotes economy of representation and computation.\nAs explained more fully in the previous\narticles on this topic, the spatial operators are high-level representations of how\nforces, torques, velocities, and accelerations propagate from link to link along\nmanipulator arms. In the extension of the\nspatial-operator algebra to manipulators\nwith flexible links, each link is represented\nby a finite-element model: the mass of a\nflexible link is apportioned among smaller,\n\nlumped-mass rigid bodies, the coupling\nof the motions of which is expressed in\nterms of vibrational modes. This leads to\nan operator expression for the modalmass matrix of the link.\nBy incorporating this expression into\nthe equations for the recursive (Iink-tolink) propagation of forces, torques, and\naccelerations, one obtains the spatialoperator algorithm for the inverse dynamics (given the accelerations, compute the\nforces and torques needed to produce\nthem) of the manipulator. These equations include an operator equation for the\nmass matrix of the entire manipulator. This\nmass matrix can be computed by a com posite-body-based recursive algorithm\nsimilar to the corresponding algorithm for\na rigid -link manipulator.\nThe forward-dynamics problem is to\ncompute the accelerations, given the\nforces and torques applied to the joints of\nthe manipulator, and the solution requires\nthe inverse of the mass matrix. For this\npurpose, an altemative factorization of the\nmass matrix has been derived. Each of\n\nthe factors in this factorization is invertible and can therefore be used in an operator equation for the inverse of the mass\nmatrix. The recursive implementation of\nthis operator equation leads to a recursive algorithm that solves the forwarddynamics problem .\nThe amount of computation required\nby the inverse- and forward-dynamics\nalgorithms is approximately proportional\nto the number of links, resulting in significant computational savings for flexible\nsystems with a large number of degrees of\nfreedom .\nThis work was done by Abhinandan\nJain and Guillermo Rodriguez of Caltech\nfor NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, write in 53 on\nthe TSP Request Card.\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.

Aspects of\nthis approach have been described in several previous articles in NASA Tech Briefs\n- most recently "Robot Control Based\non Spatial-Operator Algebra" (NPO-17918),\nVol. 16, NO. 9 (1992), page 115. Heretofore\nmost of the research and development in\nrobotics have focused on fully-actuated\nmanipulators, in which there is an actuator\nassociated with each degree of freedom.\nAn underactuated manipulator is one that\nhas fewer actuators than it has degrees of\nfreedom .\nThe concept of underactuated manipulators has greater significance than its\nmodest name connotes: It has implica72\n\nSeve ral Links\nand Joints of a\nserial-link manipulator are shown\nhere schematically.

The control problem is compounded by the fact that\nmotion in some degrees of freedom can\nbe totally or partly uncontrollable. As\nexplained more fully in the previous articles on spatial-operator algebra, the spatial operators are so named because they\n\nare high-level representations of the kinematics and dynamics that show how forces,\ntorques, velocities, and accelerations propagate through space from link to link along\nthe manipulator arms. The spatial-operator\nalgebra provides a theoretical framework\nfor the kinematical and dynamical analysis\nand modeling of multiple-link robotic\nmanipulators in general, and it accommodates the complexity of underactuated\nmanipulators.\nThe development of the algorithm for\ncontrol of an underactuated manipulator\nbegins with the use of the spatial-operator\nalgebra to derive equations for the generalized Jacobian, mass matrix, and dynamical equations. A projection operator that\ncharacterizes the relationship between corresponding quantities for partly and fully\nactuated manipulators was identified .\nEfficient recursive algorithms for the\n\ninverse dynamics (given the accelerations,\nfind the forces and torques needed to\nproduce them) and the forward dynamics\n(given the forces and torques, find the\naccelerations) were derived. Showing that\nthese algorithms are hybrids of the inverseand forward-dynamics algorithms is one\nof the important contributions of the spatial-operation approach .\nThis work was done by Abhinandan\nJain and Guillermo Rodriguez of Ca/tech\nfor NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Meissner\nbearings are so named because they\nare based on the Meissner effect - the\nexclusion of a magnetic field from the\ninterior of a superconductor.\nCylindrical permanent magnets with\naxial magnetization are stacked coaxiallyon the rotor with alternating polarity.\nTypically, rare-earth magnets are used.\nThe magnets are machined and fitted\ntogether to form a conical outer surface.\nConical pressure plates face the conical\nsurfaces of the rotor, separated from\nthe rotor by small gaps. The facing surfaces of the pressure plates are covered by a material that is superconductive at and below the temperature of\nliquid nitrogen. Each pressure plate is\npart of a chamber that is kept full of liquid nitrogen.\nThe left liquid-nitrogen-chamber-andpressure-plate assembly is held in a fixed\nposition. The right liquid-nitrogen-chamber-and-pressure-plate assembly is free\nto translate a short distance axially, and\nis pressed toward the left by a set of\nsprings. Because of the Meissner effect,\nthe alternating-polarity magnetic field at\nthe ends of the magnets cannot penetrate the pressure plates. Instead, it\nbecomes squeezed into the gaps\nbetween the conical surfaces of the rotor\nand the pressure plates.\nAny increase in load that tends to push\nthe rotor laterally or axially toward a presNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nGaseous andl\nGaseous andl\nor liquid\nor liquid\nNitrogen Out\nNitrogen Out\nPressure\nSuperconductive\nPlate\nSurface on\nPressure Plate\n\nt\n\nEnd Plate\nof Housing\n\nliquid\nNitrogen\n\nt\n\nSupporting\nCylindrical\nHousing\nliquid\nNitrogen\nIn\n\nliquid\nNitrogen\nIn\n\nCylindrical\nPermanent Magnets\nStacked Coaxially\non Rotor\n\nThis Permanent-Magnet Meissner Bearing features an inherently stable, self-centering conical configuration.\n\n73\n\nsure plate squeezes the magnetic field\nfurther, resulting in a compensating\nincrease in magnetic pressure in the gap.\nThus, the magnetic field acts as a cushion between the rotor and the pressure\nplates.

As\nin other linear electromagnetic actuators,\nthe position of the armature can be controlled by applying a current of appropriate\nmagnitude and polarity to electromagnet\ncoils. One notable feature of the actuator is\nan extemal pole-piece subassembly that\ncould be swiveled manually about the axis\nof linear motion (which is also the axis of\ncylindrical symmetry) to vary the distribution\nof magnetic flux in such a way as to override the aforementioned electrical position\ncontrol. The small magnetic flux that extends to outside the main body of the actuator could be monitored to determine the\nposition of the armature. All of these features would make it possible to seal the\narmature hermetically while providing manual control.\nThe actuator includes outer magneticcore (pole) pieces that support fluxes from a\nmagnet assembly and fluxes from a split\nelectromagnet coil. The fluxes from the\npermanent magnets circulate in oppOSite\ndirections in the core pieces and armature\nat axially opposite ends. The halves of the\nsplit coil are wound and interconnected in\nsuch a way that the flux induced by the\ncoil circulates in one direction, with a polarity established by that of the current in the\ncoil. In either case, the flux induced by the\ncoil aids the flux from the permanent magnets in one of the magnetic-flux circuits\nand opposes it in the other. The net flux\ngenerates magnetomotive forces in the airgap at each end of the armature, of a sense\nto reduce the respective gap. Without any\nflux from the coil, the permanent-magnet\nflux produces a force that tends to toggle\nthe armature toward whichever pole is closest when the armature is released to move.\nIn the presence of flux induced by the coil,\nthe armature can be made to stroke to one\npole or the other, depending on the polarity of the current in the coil.\nThe midlength outer-pole-piece subassembly is the one that can be swiveled\n74\n\nFlux From Coli (In Ei\'t her\nthe Polarity Shown or In\nthe Opposite Pola rity)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~i~~~a-permanent\n~\n\nMagnet\n\n.\n\nMotion of\nArmature\n\n~\n\nT\n\nStati onary Pole-Piece\nSubassembly\nCROSS SECTION SHOWING FLUX PATHS\n\nSwiveling\nPo le\xc2\xb7Piece\nSubassembly\n\nNon magnetic\nMaterial\n\n.A\n\nSWIVEL IN MIDDLE ANGULAR\nPOSITION: FLUX FROM COIL\nCAN MAKE ARMATURE STROKE\nRIGHT OR LEFT\n\nStationary Pole Piece\n(Magnetic Core Materi al)\n\nSu\n\n\\:l\n(0)/\nI\n\n\'.W" " \'" m".""",,.\n\nPOSITION: ARMATURE STROKES LEFT,\n\n"".,,~\'"\n\n\'\'\'\'\'\'"0<" ,~,\n\nSWIVEL IN OTHER EXTREME ANGULAR\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2t=\\~POSITION: ARMATURE STRO KES RIGHT,\nREGARDLESS OF EXCITATION OF COIL\n\n~---r----~~--\n\nSIMPLIFIED VIEW SHOWING SWIVELING POLE-PIECE SUBASSEMBLY\nIN THREE SELECTABLE ANGULAR POSITIONS\n\nThe Distribution of Magnetic Flux Could Be Controlled electrically (by application of current to\nthe split electromagnet coil) or manually (by setting the angular position of the swiveling pole-piece\nsubassembly) to toggle the armature to the leftmost or rightmost position.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nto effect manual override. Its effect on the\ndistribution of magnetic flux is so great\nthat swiveling it from one extreme axial\nposition to the other causes the armature\nto toggle from one extreme linear position\nto the other, even when no electrical current is applied. When the swiveling subassembly is in the middle (nominal or nUll)\nangular position, the position of the armature can be controlled by applying the\nelectrical current of appropriate magnitude\nand polarity. If the swiveling subassembly is\nmaintained at either extreme angular position, the electrical current cannot generate sufficient flux to overcome the prevailing flux condition. The armature remains in\n\nthe position commanded by manual override.\nThe poSition-monitoring function is available when the swivel is in the middle angular position. A compasslike device placed\njust outside the main body of the actuator\ncan indicate the direction of prevailing flux\nand thus the position of the armature.\nAlternatively, the position of the armature\ncan be deduced from the outputs of Halleffect devices or other sensors that measure fringing magnetic fields at small gaps\nnear opposite ends of the stationary polepiece subassembly.\nThis work was done by Stephen G.

It is\ncompatible with currently used polyurethane-based coating materials and gasbubble-forming agents (called "blowing\nagents" in the industry) and is expected to\nbe compatible with materials that will be\nused in the near future. For example, it\ncan handle environmentally acceptable\nsubstitutes for chlorofluorocarbon foaming agents.\nThe system produces a fixed or variable\nrate of output of each liquid as required.\nFixed output is defined and established in\na closed-loop control scheme in which the\nsensed and controlled output is either the\nspeed of the pump or the rate of flow; the\nsystem strives to maintain either at a\ndesigned fixed value (set point). Variable\noutput can be established by use of a programmed table of up to 700 set points,\neither entered by the user or computed\nfrom a polynomial relationship. Alternatively, variable output can be obtained by\nuse of an analog voltage from an extemal\ncontrol device or derived from a computation; this method gives closed-loop control in\nreal time.\nThe system (see figure) includes, for each\nliquid, a pressurized tank, metering and\npressurizing pumps, meters, servomotors,\nand encoders. The metering pumps are of\nthe variable-displacement, multielement,\naxial-piston type, selected for accuracy\nand reliability in an industrial environment.\nThe pump housings were modified so that\nresidues of the pumped chemicals can be\nflushed out at the end of a job or when\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nControl\nComputer\n\nTank\nPressurizing\nGas (e.g.,\nNitrogen)\n\nr------I\n\nComponent\nA\n\nReturn\nFlow\n\nSpray\nHead\n\nVariable-Output\nPumping Subsystem\nfor Component A\n\n,-----------1\nI\n\nL..------------4\nI\n\nSimilar Variable\xc2\xb7Output\nPumping Subsystem for\nComponent B\n\nI ___________\n\nJ\n\nThe Variable-Output Pumping System produces metered recirculating or nonrecirculating flows\nof two liquids (Component A and Component 8 ) that are to be mixed in the spray head to make\nspray-on foam insulation.\n\n75\n\nmaterials are changed.

Controlled back\npressure is applied to each displacement\ncylinder to prevent premature vaporization\nof the blowing agent and the consequent\nfrothing that would distort the measurement. The automatic calibration ensures\naccurate mixing despite changes in pressure, temperature, and viscosity.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA proposed hermetically sealed pump\nwould compress a fluid to a pressure up to\n4,000 atm (400 MPa). The pump would\nemploy a linear electric motor instead of a\nrotary motor to avoid the need for leakageprone rotary seals. In addition, the linearmotor-powered pump would not require\npackings to seal its piston. The concept\nthus eliminates a major cause of friction\nand wear.\nThe pump would be a double-ended\ndiaphragm-type compressor (see figure).\nThe linear motor would include a pair of\nsolenoid windings encircling a magnetic\npiston in the main cavity of the pump.\nAltemating currents in the winding would\nalternately repel and attract the piston,\nmoving it from one end to the other. A\npair of springs would provide centering\nforces.\nThe cavity of the pump would be filled\nwith oil. The motion of the piston to the left\n\nin the figure would create a low pressure\non the left side of the diaphragm in the\nright heads. This would draw the\ndiaphragm inward against the compressor\nbody, thereby drawing the fluid to be compressed through an inlet check valve in the\ncavity in the right headplate. Once the\ndiaphragm bottoms out against the compressor body, the oil pressure would go\nvery low, drawing oil through the oil check\nvalve into the space on the left side of the\nright diaphragm.\nWhen the linear motor retums the piston\nto the right in the figure, it would raise the\noil pressure on the right diaphragm, forcing\nit against the headplate and expelling the\nfluid to be compressed through an outlet\ncheck valve. Once the diaphragm bottoms\nout against the head plate, an oil relief valve\nwould allow oil to flow back to the main\ncavity of the pump to equalize the pressure\nin the right end again. The cycle would\n\nthen repeat. While the right head would\nbe drawing in low-pressure fluid, the left\nhead would be discharging high-pressure\nfluid, and vice versa.\nTo allow for contraction or expansion\nof the oil with changes in temperature, the\ncompressor body would contain a bellows. As the oil changes in volume, so\nwould the bellows. It would thereby maintain the pressure in the main cavity near\n,\n1 atm (0.1 MPa).\nThis work was done by Mark T.\nHoltzapple of Texas A. & M.

The system was developed specifically to produce research quantities of\nfibers for strong, lightweight composite\nmaterials that can withstand high temperatures in aerospace applications. The\nsystem could also be used to grow such\nsingle-crystal materials as high-temperature superconductors and fiber-optic materials. Modifications could enable the\nsystem to apply conformal coats to fibers\nas they are being grown, producing fibers\nfor a greater number of composites in\nwhich the coatings provide thermal and\nchemical compatibility between the fiber\nand matrix materials.\nThe fiber is produced from feed -rod\nstock that is introduced to a molten zone\nsuspended between the feed rod and a\nsingle-crystal seed. The feed rod is flexible\nand continuous, made of a material of\nhomogeneous composition and doped\nas needed for the intended application .\nThe thermal energy to melt the feed rod is\nsupplied by a laser beam focused onto\nand scanned across the molten zone.\nThe technique used to generate ,\nfocus, and control the laser energy is a\nmajor feature of the Melt Modulation \xe2\x84\xa2\nsystem . The innovative beam-delivery\ntechnique provides thermal control that\nmakes possible the sharp reduction of\ndiameter from that of the feed rod to\nthat of the grown fiber, thereby enabling\nshorter lengths of feed rod to yield\ngreater lengths of fiber. The linear laser\nenergy distribution produced by the Melt\nModulation\xe2\x84\xa2 results in more laser energy input into larger cross sections and\nless energy into smaller cross sections.\nThis energy distribution minimizes overheating and stabilizes the shape of the\nmolten zone. The stabilized molten zone\nallows greater attenuation between the\nsolidified fiber and the feed rod .\nThe rate of growth of fiber is governed\nby microprocessor control of motors on\nthe fiber and feed-rod pull heads.

The attachment prevents insulation particles from\nfalling at random, contaminating electronic equipment and soiling the wor1<space.\nThe attachment is a small box mounted\non one of the jaws of the stripper (see figure).

The\ntechnique is based on measurement of\nthe capacitance of a cylindrical condenser through which a bundle of\nprepregged fibers is passed axially .\nEmpirical results indicate that the capacitance is linearly related to the thickness\nof the polymer coat on the fibers in the\nbundle. A capacitive transducer has been\nused successfully to measure the thickness of polymer coats on several test\nbundles of fibers under static conditions.\nThe transducer (see figure) includes\nan aluminum cylinder containing a\npolytetrafluoroethylene tube . A bundle\nof about 3,000 polymer-coated graphite\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nfibers is passed axially through the transducer. The aluminum cylinder thus constitutes an outer electrode of a cylindrical\ncapacitor; the graphite fibers act collectively as an inner cylindrical electrode;\nand the polytetrafluoroethylene tube, the\nintervening layer of air, and the polymer\ncoat on the fibers act COllectively as the\ncapacitor dielectric medium.\nIn experiments, the capacitive transducer was employed to sense a stationary axially positioned bundle of 3 ,000\npolymer-coated graphite fibers . The\ncapacitance was measured by use of a\nprecise digital capacitance bridge capable of resolving \xc2\xb10.1 pF. As theorized,\nthe capacitance of the gauge was found\nto be related linearly to the weight of the\n\npolymer coat on the fiber. If this transducer is calibrated by use of known values of polymer loading on the graphite\nfibers, it can provide real-time sensing\nof the thickness of the polymer coat.\nHowever, the measured capacitance\nshows considerable scatter at lower\ncoating levels. For real-time monitoring at\nthese low levels, a time-averaging filter\nshould be used.

Previously, resin powder was\nplaced onto prepregs manually during\nlayup, before molding. In the manual\nmethod, powder could not be placed on a\nwet uncured prepreg: it could be placed\non only one side of the prepreg , and the\ndistribution of powder was uneven. The\ndispenser applies a predetermined amount\nof resin solid in powder form onto a fiber\ntow during the prepreg operation .\nThe dispenser includes a plastic bottle\nwith a funnel shape on one end and a\nclosing top on the other end, as shown in\nthe figure. A small motor is attached to the\nclosing top end. A shaft attached to the\nmotor extends through a nipplelike piece\nthat fits onto the funnel end . The motor\ntums the shaft, causing the powder to be\ndispensed through the nipple. The size of\nthe hole in the nipple piece determines\nthe amount of powder that is dispensed.\nThere are several interchangeable nipples\nwith diameters ranging from roughly 0.15\nto 0.20 in. (3.8 to 5.1 mm).\nThe resin-powder dispenser provides\nversatility in the distribution of solid resin in\nthe prepreg operation . Its use enables the\npowder to be distributed evenly, to be\nplaced on a wet uncured prepreg, and to\nbe placed on the top or bottom of the\nprepreg or between prepreg fibers.\nThe resin powder dispenser can be\nused wherever there is a requirement for\nan even, continuous distribution of a small\namount of powder.\nThis work was done by Clarence E.\nStandfield of Langley Research Center.\nNo further documentation is available.\nLAR-14589.\n80\n\nDrum Winder\n\ndc Power\nSupply.\n12 Volts\n\nPowder Resin\nPlastic Container\nHolding Arm\nThreaded Surface on\nLower End of Shaft\n\nDETAIL A\n\nResin Powder Is Metered through the opening in the nipple by a rotating threaded shaft.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1994\n\nMultiple Pages Intentionally Left\nBlank\n\nMathematics and\nInformation Services\nMethod of Predicting Size of Software Under Development\nA metric called "function mass" has been proposed.\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA method of estimating the size and\ncomplexity of a large computer program\nunder development is based on a metric\ncalled "function mass." "Function Mass"\nis a simplification of Demarco\'s "function\nbang" metric. The size of a completed\nprogram is usually expressed in terms of\nthe number of lines of code (SLOG), which\nhas been shown in previous research to\nbe highly correlated with the amount of\ndevelopment effort and is therefore an important predictor of development cost.\nThe proposed method of estimating the\nultimate size of a program is an intermediate product of continuing research on\nthe estimation of size and the structured\nanalysis of developmental software. This\nresearch is motivated largely by the need\nto refine estimates of size during the planning phases of software-development projects: heretofore, estimates have often been\nhigh or low by factors as large as 2 .\nThe derivation of the present method\nbegins with a modern system-development structured approach to identification\nand mathematical modeling of the requirements that the software must satisfy. The\nrequirements are typically represented in a\ndata-flow diagram (see figure) as a hierarchical set of functions represented by bubbles , with interfaces between bubbles\nshown as data-flow arrows. Higher-level\nbubbles encapsulate sets of lower, moredetailed functions, and this hierarchical\nscheme continues down to the level of\nmodules, which are somewhat loosely defined but can be considered as "black\nboxes" that perform cohesive sets of functions that can be executed by subprograms or subroutines.\nImplicit in such a hierarchical decomposition scheme is the assumption that\nthe combination of (1) the cumulative set\nof all lowest-level bubbles in a data-flow\ndiagram and (2) the cumulative set of inputs and outputs as specified in a data\ndictionary completely specifies the software system to be developed. The lowestlevel bubbles are described in terms of\nelementary functions that, collectively,\ndescribe the function performed by the\nbubble. Therefore, the size of the software can be represented as S =S(8,I, 0),\nwhere 8 is the number of bubbles at the\nlowest level, I is the number of inputs\nNASA Tech Briefs, July 1994\n\nThis Portion of a Data-Flow Diagram contains three nodes represented as bubbles, each labeled\naccording to its functional classification. The number next to each arrow denotes the number of\ntokens transferred along the corresponding link between nodes.\n\nneeded by the bubbles, and 0 is the number of outputs generated by the bubbles.\nThe parameters I and 0 are measured at\nthe lowest level at which they are defined\nin the data dictionary.\nOne matter of concern in this approach is\nthe leveling problem, which pertains to\nthe differences among bubbles with regard to the granularity of the decompOSition. A data-flow diagram produces a hierarchical functional decomposition such\nthat a level i bubble encapsulates the\ncumulative set of functions at level i + 1 .\nThe basic guideline has been to continue\nbreaking out the functionality until some\nmetric of the size of a bubble is approximately equal for all bubbles or until the\naverage has reached a minimum. This is\noften not practical because there is often\nnot enough time and information to do a\ncomplete analysis when an estimate of\ncost must be made. Instead, in the present method, the relative size of a bubble is\nrepresented approximately by the number\nof requirements (R) associated with it. R is\nthen used as the metric of size in the hierarchical decomposition.\nAnother important concept in the present method is that of the structural complexity (SC), which is quantified on a scale of\n1 to 12. The SC of a bubble is computed\nby an algorithm that starts at 1 and adds 1\nfor each positive answer to a set of 11\nquestions about the function(s) to be per-\n\nformed by the bubble. For example, the\nfirst question is whether the input data\nmust be kept in a specified order, and\nthe fifth question is whether the precision\nof the computation is important.\nIn the foregoing context, the function\nmass (FM) is defined in functional form;\nnamely,\n\nFM = FM (S, SC)\nwhere\n\nS\n\n= S(8 , I, 0,\n\nR)\n\nThe precise functional forms of FM and\n\nS are not yet clear, and three tentative\nforms have been tested with respect to\nability to predict SLOC:\n\n(1 ) FM = IntI + 0) \xe2\x80\xa2 R \xe2\x80\xa2 SC\n(2) FM = (I + 0) \xe2\x80\xa2 R \xe2\x80\xa2 SC\n(3) FM = (I + 0)8 \xe2\x80\xa2 Rb \xe2\x80\xa2 (SC)9\nwhere a, b, and 9 are obtained by statistical fits to information about real software\ndevelopment tasks . The results of the\ntests found that these functions are statistically significant measures of SLOG. The\nsoftware size metric \'\'function mass" is currently being used to evaluate the size and\ndevelopment costs of subsystems of the\nDeep Space Network.\nThis work was done by Jairus M.

The model represents combinations\nof interdependent subsystems that could support microbes,\nplants, fish, and land animals (including humans). The generic\nmodel enables rapid configuration of a variety of specific life\nsupport component models for tradeoff studies that could culminate in a single system design.

The overall hierarchical structure is divided into four levels, as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Level 0 represents the overall life-support system and its\ninterfaces with the outside world. A description of level 0 would\ninclude the weight, volume, and other parameters of the entire\nsystem and the flows of heat and material be-tween the system\nand the outside world.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Level 1 breaks the system down into subsystems for\nhumans, plants, aquaculture, microbes, and animals. For example, a subsystem for humans could include a habitat with\nassociated temperature and humidity controls, air-revitalization\nequipment, and water-treatment equipment. Each subsystem\nwould be described in terms of its weight, volume, and inflow\nand outflow of heat and materials.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Level 2 breaks the subsystems down into functional elements. Each element is generic so that choices from among a\nvariety of technologies can be made.
