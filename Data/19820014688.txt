b'D\n\nFIRST DOWN & GOAL TO GO\nGene Little\n\n(Deputy Supervisor - Department of Natural\nState of Washington,\nOlympia, WA)\n\nResources\n\nIntroduction\nI think it is safe to say that we are in the beginning of a new era in\nthe Landsat Program.\nThe new era is a change from a research and development/demonstration\nmode to an operational mode.\nThis has been a\ngoal of all people involved in the Landsat Program since it\'s inception\nin the late 1960\'s.\nAt last, with our goal nearly at hand, we are now\nin a crucial phase to insure the development\nof a successful and operational Landsat Program that provides needed and timely resource information to Managers and Planners.\nThe Landsat program would never have\nreached this important stage without the pioneering,\ninnovative and\ntenacious efforts of everyone involved in this program.\nThese years\nof dedicated effort have not been without confrontation\nand conflict\nwithin our ranks, but this has only served to strengthen our cause\nwhich is borne out by the fact that the operational program is at hand.\nThis is an issue we need to learn to cope with.\n\nNow is the time to draw together, assess the situation and outline a\njoint cooperative strategy for the 1980\'s to insure success.\nToday,\nI would llke to touch on three elements:\nFirst, highlight past program accomplishments\nin Washington which have contributed to the present\nsituation.\nSecond, I want to describe this crucial interim phase betweeen the faltering demonstration\nand the operational system.\nFinally,\nI want to suggest a game plan for the 1980s.\n\nPast To Present\nLandsat projects conducted cooperatively between NASA and Washington\nState Agencies during the 1970s, have established\nthe Landsat system\nas a viable means of collecting and disseminating\nsome types of natural\nresource information.\nResource Managers have long recognized the potential application and benefits of Landsat since even before the launch\nof the first Earth Resources Technology\nSatellite in 1972.\nIn the late\n1960\'s, the usefulness of satellite data to state agencies was explored\nby studying simulated space imagery collected by NASA\'s hlgh-altitude\naircraft.\nSoon after the actual Landsat data became available in 1972,\nWashington agencies were ready\ninto its\' operational value.\n\nMany Washington\njects that have\n\nand in a position\n\nto conduct\n\nresearch\n\nState Agencies have been active in demonstration\nprodealt with a wide variety of resource applications\nfor\n\n1-93\n\nLandsat data.\nNASA and the Pacific Northwest Regional Commission have\nplayed an important role in the funding and execution of these projects.\nLet us review a few examples, by discipline,\nthat will illustrate Washington\'s interest in making the use of Landsat data an operational\nreality.\nThese projects have emphasized issues that are regionally important in\nthe area of forestry, agriculture, water resources, land use and wildlife\nmanagement.\n\nGreat strides have been made toward incorporating Landsat data into\nexisting state forestry inventory programs.\nThese forestry projects\nhave focused on determining the level of detail of forest resource information extractable from Landsat, and on how the value of resource\ndata from Landsat might be increased by using other data such as aerial\nphotography, existing computer inventory data and digital terrain data.\nThese studies have also examined how the type of forest resource data\nfrom Landsat compares with_the type of inventory data currently required\nfor present forest planning and management purposes.\nLandsat data has\nalso been used to monitor forest harvest activities to supplement information reported to revenue agencies for tax collection purposes.\nIn\naccomplishing\nthese research/demonstration\nprojects, we have learned a\ngreat deal about Landsat\'s role in the information process and in addition, we have been able to produce some valuable information about our\nforest resource base.\n\nLand\n\nUse Planning\n\nAnother discipline in which Washington agencies have conducted Landsat\nstudies, is land use planning.\nStudies were undertaken to provide local\nand county planners with land use statistics for comprehensive planning.\nThese studies, have explored how Landsat data can be used with available\nfederal,\nstate and local data sources in a digital geographic multiple\nuse information\nsystem concept, and have had a goal of providing planners\nwith new types of information not available from traditional sources.\n\nIn addition to forestry and land use investigations,\nwildlife managers\nhave used Landsat to identify prime wildlife habitats, and Landsat data\nhas been used to aid in the development of optimal water use policy by\nidentifying and monitoring high water demand landuses.\n\nIt is difficult to name a resource discipline that has not investigated\nthe potential use of Landsat.\nI want to emphasize that these projects\nare research projects.\nThey are not considered operational because\nLandsat data is not being continually relied upon to direct management\ndecisions.\nHowever, they were successful because they demonstrated\nthat\nLandsat can be relied upon to provide the kind of information we need.\nWhat remains is to work out a cost effective way to provide it.\n\n1-94\n\nThis brings us to today.\nThe interim breather between the old "demonstration" Landsat system and the launch of the operational satellite.\nThe demonstration projects of the 1970\'s are complete.\nIt is up to us\nto comprehensively\nre-assess all of the projects of the last decade and\ndecide\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWhat Landsat can do and cannot do\nHow the Landsat data needs to be assembled\nHow Landsat data can make the program cost effective\nWhat it could do if constraints on the old research and\ndevelopment system were removed, such as delivery time\nand format.\n\nThe opportunity exists to participate in the design of the operational\nsystem.\nThe pathways for communication\nare open.\nThose of us who\nparticipated in the demonstration\nprojects now need to participate in\nthe design of the institution delivery system and now to the game plan\nfor the 1980s.\n\nGame Plan For The\n\n1980s\n\nI recognize this interim period we are in, is a time of uncertainty because of both funding and political reasons, but I see this as an opportunity.\nThis time should not be squandered.\nImportant issues need\nto be addressed and resolved regarding the implementation\nof the operational system.\nPast demonstration\nprojects should now be reviewed\ncarefully.\nEnough demonstration\nprojects have been performed to identify\nconsistent patterns emerging from the results.\nFor example, Landsat can\nrealiably provide general Level i and Level 2 resource data when used by\nitself, but this level of information is generally not needed.\nAddltioual\nresource data can be provided at Level 3 or 4 by incorporating\nother\nlayers of data with skilled resource analysts.\nThis adds considerably\nto the cost and complexity of the operation.\nIt is, however, such\nLevel 3 and 4 data that is most needed.\nThese costs, the technology\nand personnel needed, to apply it, could price this kind of Landsat\nderived information, out of reach for many resource management/planning\nefforts.\n\nThe game plan for the 1980s, then, needs to focus on creating costeffective Level 3 and 4 information and incorporating\nthe data into\nexisting programs.\nThe way we can overcome the cost constraints\nis by\nusing Landsat data as layer of geographical\ninformation in a geographic\ninformation system which many states, such as Texas and Minnesota, are\npresently developing or have in place.\nThe Washington concept of a GIS\nis simply a service center that archives and disseminates resource\n\n1-95\n\ninformation.\nThis concept is being proposed because many resource\nagencies use and need common data such as land use, topography,\nownership, legal and political boundaries.\nWhen all agencies work cooperatively, the entire process of obtaining and using resource data is\nmade more cost-effectlve.\nThis is a particularly\nimportnat consideration in these times of tight budgets.\nI believe the sponsors of this\nconference recognize the relationship between cost-effective\ndissemination/_se of Landsat data and geographic information systems as evidenced\nby the program content of this conference.\n\nWe in Washington believe incorporation of Landsat data into\nmultiple GIS will increase the potential for success of the\nprogram.\nThe following points illustrate how incorporating\na geographic information system will improve the chances of\nan operational\nsystem\n--\n\na state\noperational\nLandsat into\nsuccess for\n\n1\n\nThe computer technology is similar.\nBoth GIS and Landsat\ndigital processing operate most effectively on mid-size\ncomputers with specialized graphic capability that are\ndedicated to the application.\nSuch systems are costly\nfor a single agency to acquire and use, but become more\njustifiable when their utility is expanded from solely\nan image processing system to the more general geo-processing\nsystem.\nAn operational Landsat program can be implemented\nmore cost-efficiently\nin this context by sharing equipment\nand costs.\n\n2\n\nLandsat\n\ndata\n\nis more\n\nuseful\n\nif combined\n\nand used in con-\n\njunction with other types of resource data presently required by resource managers.\nThe increased cost and complexlty of this kind of image analysis is largely due to\ntraditional image processing systems being optimized to\nhandle images of spectral data.\nThe geographic _ncillary\ndata does not usually fit well in this environment, so that\nthe processes of merging it with spectral data and subsequent\nanalysis requires indirect and inefficient analysis.\nThe\ngeographic information system has streamlined\nthese analyses\nso that by marrying the image system and the GIS, best procedures are provided, thus reducing the complexity of the\nsolution and costs.\n3\n\nThe large cost of entering ancillary data in a Landsat project, is reduced when analysis is performed through a GIS.\nOne of the fundamental ideas in building a shared geographic\ndata base is that much of the resource data is used in identical form by all users of the system.\nThese high priority\ndata layers would be the first entered so they would be\n\n1-96\n\navailable without delay for future GIS applications,\nsuch as\nLandsat analysis.\nMost Landsat projects using ancillary data\nhave not had the benefit of such a pre-existing data base so\nhigh costs of data entry run up project costs and delay delivery of results.\nIn a properly planned GIS where Landsat is\nconsidered only a specialized data layer, the benefits of a\nGIS can reduce high costs of data entry and increase the\ntimeliness of results.\n\nTo summarize these 3 points, the hassles involved with acquiring and\nusing image processing systems, added to the hassles of obtaining and\nassembling Landsat and ancillary data, combined with the constraints\nof processing geoinformation\nin an image processing environment, causes\nLandsat\'s unique advantages to be diluted if not eliminated.\nThese 3\nproblems can be resolved by creation of a GIS system with Landsat subordinated as a data layer.\nLandsat\'s advantages, such as synoptic view,\nwill be improved and the reduced time and costs required for each Landsat\nproject could allow more frequent analysis of Landsat\'s multispectral\nrepetitive coverage.\nIt is these characteristics\nthat make Landsat\nunique and valuable.\nIt is these characteristics\nthat should be enhanced.\n\nSummary\nIn conclusion, I want to say that in the State of Washington, we have\ndeveloped a strategy - a i0 year game plan for transition to the operational system.\nThis game plan is to carefully examine the results of\npast demonstration\nprojects to identify successful operational applications, take advantage of geographic information systems, and finally,\nwork toward reducing/elimianting\nconstraints of the present system that\nare inhibiting operational use.\nWe believe we have demonstrated our\nsupport of the Landsat program by sending a user representative\nto NOAA\nwho is working for the next two years with that agency in the development\nof a user-oriented\nsystem.\nWe believe Landsat has great advantages and\nwe are working to make it a reality.\nWe are currently sponsoring GIS\nlegislation in the legislature of our state.\n\nI believe, through dedicated efforts of all participants\nin the Landsat\nprogram, that we have experienced a highly successful research/development and demonstration\nprogram and achieved a measure of success toward\nthe implementation\nof an operational program.\nAll participants\nare to\nbe congratulated.\nHowever, we are presently at a crucial turning point.\nWe need to re-assess our position, be sure emphasis is on the right\nsyllable, figure out how to take advantage of the efforts of the past 8\nyears, coordinate our efforts so as to enhance Landsat\'s advantages in\na cost-effective manner, then proceed.\nThis will require a different\nemphasis - a different mode of operation for most of us - one of interdiscipline,\ninteragency, perhaps interstate cooperation - but if we can\nmake the change, Landsat can deliver.\n\n1-97\n\n'
