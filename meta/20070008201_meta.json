In the case of the Space Shuttle, the External Tank uses several thermal protection systems to maintain the temperature of the cryogenic fuels. A few of these systems are polyurethane, closed cell foams. In an attempt to better understand the foam behavior on the tank, we are in the process of developing and improving thermal-mechanical models for the foams. These models will start at the microstructural level and progress to the overall structural behavior of the foams on the tank. One of the key properties for model characterization and verification is thermal expansion. Since the foam is not a material, but a structure, the modeling of the expansion is complex. It is also exacerbated by the anisoptropy of the material. During the spraying and foaming process, the cells become elongated in the rise direction and this imparts different properties in the rise direction than in the transverse directions. Our approach is to treat the foam as a two part structure consisting of the polymeric cell structure and the gas inside the cells. The polymeric skeleton has a thermal expansion of its own which is derived from the basic polymer chemistry. However, a major contributor to the thermal expansion is the volume change associated with the gas inside of the closed cells. As this gas expands it exerts pressure on the cell walls and changes the shape and size of the cells. The amount that this occurs depends on the elastic and viscoplastic properties of the polymer skeleton. The more compliant the polymeric skeleton, the more influence the gas pressure has on the expansion. An additional influence on the expansion process is that the polymeric skeleton begins to breakdown at elevated temperatures and releases additional gas species into the cell interiors, adding to the gas pressure. The fact that this is such a complex process makes thermal expansion ideal for testing the models. This report focuses on the thermal expansion tests and the response of the microstructure. A novel optical method is described which is appropriate for measuring thermal expansion at high temperatures without influencing the thermal expansion measurement. Detailed microstructural investigations will also be described which show cell expansion as a function of temperature. Finally, a phenomenological model on thermal expansion will be described.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070008201, "endDate": "2006-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Engineering Science", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "f8431a510c2e407eafcf9c2de582b868", "id": "3e012609d7344a1d80467dc2011b5aea"}], "name": "SES 2006 43rd Annual Technical Meeting of the Society of Engineering Science: Thermo-Structural Mechanics and Fracture of Closed-cell Rigid Polymeric Foams", "location": "University Park, PA", "id": "f8431a510c2e407eafcf9c2de582b868", "startDate": "2006-08-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070008201, "id": "d6dd8dbcb9c746f7b677d03434a93d10", "publicationDate": "2006-08-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070008201.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070008201/downloads/20070008201.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070008201/downloads/20070008201.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070008201/downloads/20070008201.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
