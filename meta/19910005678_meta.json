The broad and almost structureless appearance of them demonstrates lack of translation symmetry in these solids that must be considered amorphous or glassy silicates. There is no direct information on the cations in these interstellar silicates and on the number of bridging oxygens per tetrahedron (NBO). Comparing experimental results gained on amorphous silicates, e.g., silicate glasses, of cosmically most abundant metals (Mg, Fe, Ca, Al) with the observations is the only way to investigate interstellar silicate dust mineralogy (cf, Dorschner and Henning, 1986). At Jena University Observatory IR spectra of submicrometer-sized grains of pyroxene glasses (SSG) were studied. Pyroxenes are common minerals in asteroids, meteorites, interplanetary, and supposedly also cometary dust particles. Pyroxenes consist of linearly connected SOT (NBO=2). In the vitreous state reached by quenching melted minerals, the SOT remain nearly undistorted (Si-O bond length unchanged); the Si-O-Si angles at the bridging oxygens of pyroxenes, however, scatter statistically. Therefore, the original cation oxygen symmetry of the crystal (octahedral and hexahedral coordination by O) is completely lost. The blended bands at 10 and 18 microns lose their diagnostic differences and become broad and structureless. This illustrates best the basic problem of interstellar silicate mineral diagnostics. Optical data of glasses of enstatite, bronzite, hypersthene, diopside, salite, and hedenbergite have been derived. Results of enstatite (E), bronzite (B), and hypersthene (H) show very good agreement with the observed silicate features in the IR spectra of evolutionarily young objects that show P-type silicate signature according to the classification by Gurtler and Henning (1986). Compositional parameters and main characteristics of experimental SSG spectra in IR for the glasses E, B, and H are shown in tabular form. Results fit excellently the relations derived by Koike and Hasegawa (1987) and suggest that the band ratio of the astronomical silicate by Draine and Lee (1984) is too low.", "title": "Steps toward interstellar silicate dust mineralogy", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910005678, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dorschner, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Universitaets-Sternwarte", "location": "Jena, Germany"}}, "id": "f086614e3d5c42c08ca30beb09ca53f2"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910005678, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Guertler, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Universitaets-Sternwarte", "location": "Jena, Germany"}}, "id": "7eb6288e48d647e5bf1f26ecf28c5196"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19910005678, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Henning, TH."}, "organization": {"name": "Universitaets-Sternwarte", "location": "Jena, Germany"}}, "id": "9b0444a78f7d4ab29295d58a19a2edec"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910005678, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910005678, "id": "c6069e5a80cf465f8fab0c6e27f276dd", "publicationName": "NASA, Ames Research Center, Interstellar Dust: Contributed Papers", "publicationDate": "1989-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910005678.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910005678/downloads/19910005678.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910005678/downloads/19910005678.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910005678/downloads/19910005678.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
