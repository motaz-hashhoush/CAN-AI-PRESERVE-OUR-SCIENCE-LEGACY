Signifying a substantial regional imprint, a negative AD index corresponds with positive downwelling clear-sky LW flux anomalies (greater than10W m(exp -2)) north of western Eurasia (0 deg E-120 deg E) and reduced sea ice growth in the Barents and Kara Seas in November-February. Conversely, a positive AO index coincides with negative clear-sky LW flux anomalies and minimal sea ice growth change in October-November across the Arctic. Increased (decreased) atmospheric temperature and water vapor coincide with the largest positive (negative) clear-sky flux anomalies. Positive surface LW cloud radiative effect anomalies also accompany the negative AD index in December-February. The results highlight a potential pathway by which Arctic atmospheric variability influences the regional surface radiation budget over areas of Arctic sea ice growth.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "44", "submissionId": 20170008763, "issue": "9", "issn": "0094-8276", "publisher": "American Geophysical Union", "eissn": "1944-8007", "id": "694b94e33dd14c46a3df1f009da973e6", "publicationName": "Geophysical Research Letters", "publicationDate": "2017-05-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
