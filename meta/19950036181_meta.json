In order to determine the field in the absence of the aircraft, an aircraft calibration is required. In this work a matrix inversion method is introduced for calibrating an aircraft equipped with four or more electric field sensors and a high-voltage corona point that is capable of charging the aircraft. An analytic, closed form solution for the estimate of a (3 x 3) aircraft calibration matrix is derived, and an absolute calibration experiment is used to improve the relative magnitudes of the elements of this matrix. To demonstrate the calibration procedure, we analyze actual calibration date derived from a Lear jet 28/29 that was equipped with five shutter-type field mill sensors (each with sensitivities of better than 1 V/m) located on the top, bottom, port, starboard, and aft positions. As a test of the calibration method, we analyze computer-simulated calibration data (derived from known aircraft and ambient fields) and explicitly determine the errors involved in deriving the variety of calibration matrices. We extend our formalism to arrive at an analytic solution for the ambient field, and again carry all errors explicitly.", "title": "Aircraft electric field measurements: Calibration and ambient field retrieval", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T22:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950036181, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Koshak, William J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "f1086ffbf0d2446dafd442c9730e5b31"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950036181, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bailey, Jeff"}, "organization": {"name": "University of Alabama, Huntsville, AL", "location": "United States"}}, "id": "157a76099f394b8dbc4f664cc4c8f482"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19950036181, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Christian, Hugh J."}, "organization": {"name": "University of Alabama, Huntsville, AL", "location": "United States"}}, "id": "f27ccb2815674616a34b71ea14d0a3f9"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19950036181, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mach, Douglas M."}, "organization": {"name": "University of Alabama, Huntsville, AL", "location": "United States"}}, "id": "c4500e568c854f7c80275a7e358fb8be"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950036181, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1029/94JD01682", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "99", "submissionId": 19950036181, "issue": "D11", "issn": "0148-0227", "id": "a6999b8040084e0caa6ba46d4dbb64c7", "publicationName": "Journal of Geophysical Research", "publicationDate": "1994-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
