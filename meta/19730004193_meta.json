The basic mechanical/structural differences associated with space-basing were identified by analyzing a space-basing strategy in which the tug and payload are launched separately by the EOS and comparing it with the ground-based mode in which the tug/payload is launched as an integral unit in the EOS. This operational concept, which is the simplest of a number of possible space-basing strategies, was also used to identify the major impacts on the Earth Orbit Shuttle. The mechanical/structural differences that were identified from a comparison of payloads operating in the ground and space-based modes of operation are discussed in addition to delineating the advantages and disadvantages associated with various payload deployment/retrieval mechanisms.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730004193, "id": "f9b7491c9f244cecaaf6ac462f499f37", "publicationDate": "1971-09-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19730004193.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19730004193/downloads/19730004193.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19730004193/downloads/19730004193.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19730004193/downloads/19730004193.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
