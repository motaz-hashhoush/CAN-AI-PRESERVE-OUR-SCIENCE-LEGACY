In about 280 B.C. Aristarchus suggested\nEarth revolves around the Sun and estimated the\ndistance between. Around 130 B.C. Hipparchus\ndeveloped the first accurate star map.\nToday still seek to understand how the universe\nformed and how we came to be & are we alone?\n\nBy Raphael - Personal gift, Public Domain,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=44583579\n\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s NASA Goals for Space Exploration:\nInward Looking\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understanding the causes and consequences of climate\nchange using advanced space missions with major Earth\nscience and applications research.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fire the public imagination and inspire students to pursue\nSTEM fields.

An object at rest will stay at rest unless acted on by\nan unbalanced force. Law of Inertia\nExhaust\n2) Acceleration is produced when a force acts on a mass. a=F/m\npushes\n3) For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\nback\n1\n\nPush\nexhaust\nthis\nway\n\n2\n3\n\nThrust\n\nExhaust\n\nHow Do Rockets Work?\nRockets use Newton\xe2\x80\x99s Third\nlaw of motion:\n\nExhaust\npushes\nback\nPush\nexhaust\nthis\nway\n\nWhen one body exerts a force on a second body,\nthe second body exerts a force equal in\nmagnitude and opposite in direction on the first\nbody.\n\nHow Do Rocket Engines Work?\nAll rocket engines must send its fuel out one\nend very rapidly in order to create thrust for\nthe rocket to move in the opposite direction.\nThat can be made to happen by heating the\nfuel or by explosion and, for the solid rocket\non the left and liquid fuel rocket on the right,\nby passing the heated gas through the throat\nof a nozzle.\nThese engines use the energy of chemical\nreactions to create hot gas at high pressure for\nthrust. Other engines can use nuclear\nreactions to create heat, while ion engines\nmake elementary particles go extremely fast\njust using electrical energy.\n\nHow Do Satellites Stay in Orbit?\n\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity pulls objects toward Earth\xe2\x80\x99s center. If the rocket goes fast enough and in\na direction parallel to Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface, then its path can be a circle or ellipse. The\nsatellite is always \xe2\x80\x9cfalling\xe2\x80\x9d toward the Earth, but is moving fast enough forward to fall\naround the Earth instead of into it.\n\nYour Rocket Launches\nAs part of the merit badge requirements you are required to carry out two rocket\nlaunches.\n1) Build, launch, and recover a model rocket.\n2) Make a second launch to accomplish a specific objective. What might that be?\n\nRocket launch safety:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use only prepackaged engines\n\xe2\x80\xa2 No metal in your rocket\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Only use approved launch\nignition\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Have room to fly safely\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Launch controller must be\ndisabled and untouched until\nlaunch\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Range safety control:\nannounce/count-down launch\n\n'
