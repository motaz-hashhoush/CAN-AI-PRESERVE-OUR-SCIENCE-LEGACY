NASA s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) project has set aggressive goals in these three areas including a noise goal of 42 dB cumulative below the Stage 4 certification level. The goal for the reduction of oxides of nitrogen is 75% below the current standard. The fuel burn reduction goal is 50% below that of a current state-of-the-art aircraft. Furthermore, the overall goal of ERA is to mature technologies that will meet these goals simultaneously and with a timeframe of 2020 for technical readiness. This paper outlines the key technologies and the progress achieved to date toward the goals.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "France", "submissionId": 20100033776, "endDate": "2010-09-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "27th International Congress of the Aeronautical Sciences (ICAS)", "location": "Nice", "id": "2731b4f8cd3643bb810a92f9c1fdaf71", "startDate": "2010-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100033776, "id": "0997fe987caa4754ac1b2df866c7dbc5", "publicationDate": "2010-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100033776.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100033776/downloads/20100033776.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100033776/downloads/20100033776.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100033776/downloads/20100033776.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
