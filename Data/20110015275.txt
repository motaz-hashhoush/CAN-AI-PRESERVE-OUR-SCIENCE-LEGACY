For IGR Jl6207-5129, we provide the first broadband\n(0.5-60 keY) spectrum from which we confirm a large intrinsic column density (NH == 16 X 10 22\ncm- 2 ), and constrain the cutoff energy for the first time (Ec\n\n19 keY). We observed a prolonged\n\n(> 30 ks) attenuation of the X-ray flux which we tentatively attribute to an eclipse of the probable\n\nneutron star by its massive companion. For IGR Jl739J-3021, we witnessed a transition from\nquiescence to a low-activity phase punctuated by weak flares whose peak luminosities in the\n\n0.5-10 keY band are only a factor of 5 times that of the pre-tlare emission. The weak flaring is\naccompanied by an increase in the absorbing column which suggests the accretion of obscuring\nclumps of wind. Placing this observation in the context of the recent Swift monitoring campaign,\nwe now recognize that these low-activity epochs constitute the most common emission phase for\nthis system, and perhaps in other SFXTs as well.\n8th INTEGRAL Workshop "The Restless Gamma-ray Universe"\nSeptember 27-30 2010\nDuhlin Cast/e, Dublin, Ireland\n~Spcakcr.\n\nTAB and JATacknowlcdgc grants: Suzaku NNX08AB88G, Chandra G089055X, and iNTEGRAL NNX08AC9IG.\n\n@Copyrighto\\\\TI!.:dby the illlthnr(s} under the tenns oftht: Creative Commons Attnbution-NonCommcrclal-SharcAhke Licence\n\nFigure 1: Intensity images in Galactic coordinates ofIGR Jl6207-5129 (top) and IGR Jl7391-3021 (bottom) in the 0.5-10 keY energy range as taken by the XIS-l detector aboard Suzaku.\n\n1. Introduction & Observations\nAmong the more intriguing results by INTEGRAL has been the discovery of new types of\nhigh-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) with supergiant companions. They can be broadly divided\ninto systems that are persistently-emitting (SGXBs: supergiant X-ray binaries) and those that emit\nsporadically (SFXTs: supergiant fast X-ray transients). The distinction between the two groups is\nnot as clearly defined as once believed. Therefore, the continued study of these systems is crucial\nfor understanding the origin and evolution of these previously-rare HMXBs.\nIn 2008, the Suzaku space telescope observed two such objects: the SGXB named IGR J16207-5129\nand the SFXT dubbed IGR J17391- 3021 (= XTE J1739-302). Fig. 1 presents images of the\nfields around the 2 sources. Note that XIS did not record data during the first observation of\nIGR J16207-5129. In addition, IGR 117391-3021 was very faint during its observation so HXD\nrecorded few photon counts. Hence, HXD data were ignored in the analysis ofIGR JI7391-3021.\nAfter removing bad events, and after extracting gaps in the observation, the effective exposure\ntimes that remained were 33 and 37 ks for IGR J16207-5129 and IGR 117391-3021, respectively.\n\n2. X-ray Variability\n2.1 IGR J16207-5129\nThe light curve from IGR J16207-5129 (Fig. 2) illustrates that the emission varies within\n1-2 orders of magnitude on ks timescales, which is typical of persistent SGXBs. The maximum\nluminosity is 5 x 1035 erg s-I (d/6 kpc)2, while the minimum is 2 x 1034 erg s-I.\n2\n\nArash Bodaghee\n\nSuzaku observations oj1GR JJ6207-5129 and IGR J1739J-3021\n\nrrN 01\n\n~\ng\n\n!\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\nfr\ntl!f!O,"{WJD)\n\nFigure 2: Left: Background-subtracted light curve ofIGR Jl6207-5129 from XIS (red: 0.5-10 keY) and\nHXD (blue: 15-60 keY).

The dashed line represents MJD 54527.382. This corresponds to the onset of an unusually long period\n(more than 30 ks) of suppressed flux which could represent an eclipse ofthe compact object by its supergiant\nstellar companion. Right: Light curve ofIGR Jl7391-3021 from XIS, Swift-XRT, and XMM-Newton. The\ntop panel presents the background-subtracted light curve from our Suzaku observation (red crosses, 240-s\nbinning). In the bottom panel, the source light curve from the Swift monitoring campaign of Romano et al.\n(2009) is shown (blue circles, ~ I ks of exposure time per data point) along with their 3-CT upper limits for\nnon-detections (green downward arrows). The blue upwards arrows designate the maximum nux of large\noutbursts detected by Swift that are situated beyond the scale of the graph. The average nux from our 37ks Suzaku observation is plotted as a single red cross at the intersection of the dotted lines. The magenta\ntriangle at MJD 54740 corresponds to the average flux in a 31-ks observation with XMM-Newton (Bozzo et\naI., 2010). Fluxes are given in the 0.5-10 keY energy band as observed in units of 10- 11 ergcm- 2 s-I.\n\nIntriguingly, X-rays from the source, and the variability associated with that emission, are\nsignificantly diminished during the last ~30 ks of the observation. Several mechanisms can be\ninvoked to explain the suppression of X-ray emission for a sustained period. If the accretor were\nto enter an "off" state, this would last a few 100 s, or at least an order of magnitude shorter than\nthe period of inactivity that we observed. Occulting clumps in the wind or hydrodynamic effects\nwould lead to changes in N H , which we do not see. An occultation of the neutron star\'s shock face\nwould imply unrealistic column densities at other orbital phases. A remaining viable explanation\nis an eclipse of the primary by its donor star, but the data do not allow us to confirm or reject\nthis hypothesis. Finally, we note that whatever mechanism is involved in driving the sporadic\nemission in SFXTs could be responsible for the prolonged dip (e.g., the 33-ks dormant period of\nIGR 117391-3021 in Fig. 2).\n\n2.2 IGRJ17391-3021\nDuring the initial 33 ks of the observation of IGR J 17391-3021, the source is in an extremely\n3\n\nSuzaku observations\n\nJ16207-5129 and IGR J17391-3021\n\nArash\n\nFigure 3: Left: Suzaku spectrum ofIGR 116207-5129 COlTccted for the background and fit with an absorbed\npower law with an exponential cutoff whose parameters are listed in Table I.

Right: Solutions to a\nmodel of an eclipsing SGXB (Rappaport & Joss, 1983) viewed under different inclination angles (degrees).\nThe compact object is assumed to be a neutron star of 1.4 Mo, and the mass of the companion star is set to\n20 Mo with a radius of 20 Ro. The eclipse lasts> 30 ks (solid curve). The dot-dashed lines represent the\nlimits of orbital radii of clumpy winds in SGXBs (Negueruela et a!., 2008). The shaded region shows the\nextent of the parameter space in which IGR 116207-5129 might be located.\n\nlow-activity phase that is at or near quiescence (Fig. 2). The source then enters a period of enhanced\nactivity in which the luminosity is only a factor of 5 that of the "quiescent" emission. Bozzo et al.\n(2010) noticed similar behavior in a recent XMM-Newton observation of this source. Observations\nprior to and after MJD 54518.92 are referred to henceforth as "dormant" and "active" epochs,\nrespectively. The active state features 3 quasi-periodic flares separated by ~ 15 ks intervals. The\nunabsorbed 0.5-10 keY luminosity is 1.3 x 1033 erg s-1 (d/2.7 kpc)2 when dormant, and 7.4 x 1033\nerg S-l when active.\nThese weak flares are just above quiescence, and their peak fluxes are at the level of the\nfaint detections (and a few upper limits) from Swift monitoring (Romano et al., 2009). Epochs of\nenhanced activity just above quiescence, but well below the bright flaring episodes typical of this\nclass, represent 60% of all observations, so they are the most common emission state. Given more\nexposure time, many Swift upper limits would be detections suggesting that the duty cycle is even\nhigher. Based on the source ephemeris (Drave et al., 2010), which places the Xlv\xc2\xa3iU-Newton and\nSuzaku observations at different phases, such low-activity states are not confined to a specific part\nof the orbit.\n\n3. Environment of the X-ray Emitter\n3.1 IGR J16207-5129\nThe spectrum ofIGR Jl6207-5129 (Fig. 3) features a large absorbing column and a possible\niron line, both of which suggest the presence of matter around the X-ray source. A cutoff near 20\nkeY favors a neutron star as the compact object. The observed attenuation of the X-ray flux can not\nbe explained by an increase in the column density since the measured absorption value does not\n4\n\nSuzaku observations\n\n0.02\n\nJ16207-5129 and IGR J17391-3021\n\nArash\n\nc\n\n0.Q1\n\n>\n\n~\n\nI\n8\n\n5x10-3\n2x10- 3\n\n10"\n5x10~4\n\n2\n\nx\n-1\n\n-2\n0.5\n\n2\nEnergy (ke V)\n\nFigure 4: Left: Background-corrected spectrum ofIGR 117391-3021 fit with an absorbed power law (see\nTable I for parameters).

An eclipse duration of at least 30 ks (0.35 d) sets a lower limit on\nthe orbital period at 0.7 d. With this constraint, and assuming typical stellar parameters, a model for\nan eclipsing binary (Rappaport & Joss, 1983) yields a parameter space that is bounded by orbital\nperiods between 4 and 9 d with inclination angles> 50\xc2\xb0. The full orbit is within the upper limit of\nthe clumpy-wind radius, unless the orbital period is greater than 10 d, which is unusual for SGXBs\nbut plausible (e.g., IGR 119140+0951 has an orbital period of 14 d).\n\n3.2 IGRJ17391-3021\nFigure 4 presents the time-averaged spectrum ofIGR 117391-3021 fit with an absorbed power\nlaw. When rGR 117391-3021 is in the active state, the NH is at least twice as high as it is in\nthe dormant phase. This is unlike what was seen by Bozzo et al. (2010) who found that the NH\nremained steady (within the statistical errors) during weak flares while the photon index varied by\naround 50%.\nDifferences in the spectral properties of the flares caught by Suzaku and Xlvfj\\1-Newton could\nbe due to unequal geometric configurations of the system between the observations. A partialcovering model fit to the XMM-Ne.vton spectrum suggests that up to 40% of the X-ray emission\nis not absorbed by the clump itself, but rather by the interstellar medium. The same model fit to\nour active spectrum reveals an absorber that shields a much larger fraction of the X-ray source\n(less than 13% of the emission is unblocked). The column density during activity is 2-4 times\nthe interstellar value which suggests that the source is not strongly absorbed (intrinsically) except\nwhen the primary accretes a clump passing along our line of sight (see also Rampy et al.. 2009).\n5\n\nSuzaku observations ofIGR J16207-5129 and IGR J17391-3021\n\nsource\n\nepoch\n\nNH\n\nr\n\nL\n\n1022 em- 2\nIGR 116207-5129\n\nIGR 117391-3021\n\ntotal\n02a\n02b\ntotal\ndormant\nactive\n\n16\xc2\xb11\n19\xc2\xb11\n19\xc2\xb15\n3.6\xc2\xb1OA\n1.0\xc2\xb10.6\n4.1\xc2\xb10.5\n\nArash Bodaghee\n\n1033\n0.9\xc2\xb10.2\nl.3\xc2\xb10.1\n1.5\xc2\xb1OA\n1.4\xc2\xb10.1\n1.0\xc2\xb10.3\n1.5\xc2\xb10.1\n\ns-l\n\n130\n240\n56\n4.8\nl.3\n7A\n\n1.05/199\n0.91/182\n0.51/64\n0.82/66\n0.68/8\n0.73/54\n\nTable 1: Parameters from absorbed power laws fit to the Suzaku spectra of IGR 116207-5129 and\nIGR 117391-3021 for various epochs.

Conclusions\nThe putative eclipse in the persistently-emitting SGXB IGR 116207-5129 awaits confirmation. As a prototypical member of the class of SFXTs, IGR 117391-3021 holds valuable clues to\nthe accretion processes of these intriguing transients. The demarcation between SGXBs and SFXTs\nis not as clear as originally believed, and a few systems might represent intermediate states between\nSFXTs and SGXBs. In this respect, the study ofIGR 116207-5129 and IGR 117391-3021 will\nplay an integral role in helping us understand the extent to which emissivity differences between\nboth populations stem from their unequal wind and orbital characteristics. These results have been\npublished as Bodaghee et al. (2010) and Bodaghee et al. (2011).\n\nReferences\nBodaghee, A., Tomsick, J.
