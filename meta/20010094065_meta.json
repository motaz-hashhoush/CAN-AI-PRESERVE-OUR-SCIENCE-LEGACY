The improvement would be in damage resistance that would reduce the resultant maintenance and inspection required. It has performed very well in every other aspect. Improving the system's damage resistance has been the subject of much research over the past several years. One of the results of that research was a new system developed for damage prone areas on the orbiter (i.e., base heat shield). That system, designated as TUFI, Toughened Uni-Piece Fibrous Insulation, was successfully demonstrated as an experiment on the Orbiter and is now baselined for the base heat shield. This paper describes the results of a current research program to further improve the TUFI tile system, thus making it applicable to more areas on the orbiter. The way to remove the current limitations of the TUFI system (i.e., weight or thermal conductivity differences between it and the baseline tile (LI-900)) is to improve the characteristics of LI-900 or AETB-8. Specifically this paper describes the results of two efforts. The first shows performance data of an improved LI-900 system involving the application of TUFI and the second describes data that shows a reduced difference in thermal conductivity between the advanced TUFI substrate (AETB-8) now used on the orbiter and LI-900.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20010094065, "endDate": "2001-06-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "National Space and Missile Materials Symposium", "id": "91434b24e67446dd8e1d0ddc08f2a1a4", "startDate": "2001-06-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010094065, "id": "8f42f9b5935f439f86cf3be472337074", "publicationDate": "2001-01-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
