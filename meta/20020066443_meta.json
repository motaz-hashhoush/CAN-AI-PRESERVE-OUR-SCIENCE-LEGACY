AESOP is a robotic endoscopic positioning system used to control the motion of a camera during endoscopic surgery. The camera, which is mounted at the end of a robotic arm, previously had to be held in place by the surgical staff. With AESOP the robotic arm can make more precise and consistent movements. AESOP is also voice controlled by the surgeon. It is hoped that this technology can be used in space repair missions which require precision beyond human dexterity. A new generation of the same technology entitled the ZEUS Robotic Surgical System can make endoscopic procedures even more successful. ZEUS allows the surgeon control various instruments in its robotic arms, allowing for the precision the procedure requires.", "title": "Robotic Surgery", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020066443, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020066443, "isbn": "0-16-050462-7", "id": "c444030cb57c4dd6a53930745177c593", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2000", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020066443.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020066443/downloads/20020066443.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020066443/downloads/20020066443.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020066443/downloads/20020066443.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
