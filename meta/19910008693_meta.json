In the past there was a number of step changes in technology, but no known really large quantum jumps are envisioned at present which could be readily applied to short haul aircraft. The one exception in the field of aerodynamics might be the application of natural laminar flow on short haul and laminar flow control on long haul aircraft. The aim in the 1990's will be to single out the major areas where advances will contribute to overcome important constraints such as fuel conservation, noise, airspace and airport saturation, and surface transportation competition.", "title": "Future regional/commuter challenges", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910008693, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Harvey, W.
