b'I\nTransportation\n\nNight Vision Camera\nlight-level viewing devices are typically\nused by the military services for surveillance\nand intelligence-gathering activities at night or\nin conditions of poor visibility; they are additionally used in such applications as medical\nimaging and spectroscopy. Conventional low\nlight TV imaging systems generally employ\nimage intensifiers together with ChargedCoupled Devices (CCDs), cameras that capture\nscenes electronically (without film) and\nproduce a digital image with relatively high\nresolution.\nPixelVision, Inc., Beaverton, Oregon has\nintroduced a new Night VideoTM\nNV652 Backilluminated CCD Camera that operates without\nan image intensifier, thereby freeing the system\nof certain limitations imposed by the intensifier, yet it is capable of acquiring quality images\nat low light levels previously attainable only\nwith image intensifier tubes; the development\ndrew upon technology developed by Scientific\nImaging Technologies, Inc. (SITe), also of\nBeaverton, and on the expertise of a longtime\nCCD developer.\nConventional video cameras use front-illuminated CCDs that impose some limitations on\nperformance. The Night Video NV652 system\nilluminates and collects charge through the\nback surface; this design permits the image\'s\nphoton to enter the CCD unobstructed,\nallowing for high efficiency light detection in\nthe visible and ultraviolet wavelengths. In a\ntypical airborne military observation application, the NV652 camera offers advantages over\nstandard intensified CCD sensors, according to\nscientists who developed the back-illuminated\nsensor. They include greater resolution under\nlow light conditions through increased sensitivity; better target identification through superior contrast and resolution; lower cost; and\nlonger lifetime through increased reliability.\n\nI\n1:\n\'\n\nchief scientific officer and director of the\ncompany\'s Advanced Sensors Division;Janesick\nwas formerly with Jet Propulsion Laboratory,\nwhere he acquired 23 years of experience in\nCCD technology and systems design.\nThe NV652 night vision camera is representative of a broad line of PixelVision back illuminated low light level imaging devices for\ngovernment, medical, scientific and industrial\napplications.
