The vibration characteristics of a concrete mat and subgrade system are difficult to\ndetermine. Therefore, the natural frequency of a\nmat-subgrade system may inadvertently coincide\nwith the vibration frequency of the mounted\nmachinery, resulting in excessive reinforced vibration.\nThe solution:\nA concrete mat which may be stressed in compression after the machinery is \xe2\x80\xa2 mounted, thus\nclosing any cracks in the mat, altering the distribution of the soil subgrade reaction on the\nmat, and changing the mat-subgrade natural\nfrequency. The post-stressing is accomplished by\n\ntightening cables passing through parabolic passages provided during construction in the concrete\nmat.\nHow it's done:\nThis vibration reducing technique depends upon\nthe assumption that closing the cracks and altering the soil subgrade pressure distribution on the\nbottom surface of a concrete mat will change the\nmat-subgrade system natural frequency.\nIf a machine is mounted on a rigid mat with a\ncentered block, as in figure (a), the bearing pressure of a noncohesive subgrade such as sand on\nthe bottom of the mat is as shown in (b). Thus,\nthe bearing pressure is greatest at the center of\nthe mat, reducing to zero at the edges. When\ncables are passed through preformed parabolic\npassages in the mat and tightened, as in (c), the\ncables introduce a horizontal compression and an\n(continued Overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the Atomic \t\nliability resulting from the use of the information contained in this\nEnergy Commission and/or the National Aeronautics and Space document, or warrants that the use of any information, apparatus,\nAdministration.

In effect, the\ncables tend to lift the center of the mat and\nforce down the edges. As a result, the pressure\ndistribution of the sand substrate on the mat\ntends toward a uniform distribution as shown in\n(e). It is not important, however, exactly what\npressure distribution between the subgrade and\nmat results after cable tightening. The essential\nfeature is that the rigidity of the mat and the\ndistribution do change, thus altering the matsubgrade natural frequency.\nFor cohesive subgrades, such as clay, the initial\npressure distribution on the mat is the opposite\nof that for noncohesive subgrades, resulting in a\nminimum pressure at the mat center and a maximum at the edges. The cables therefore pass\nthrough a parabolic passage which is concave\ndownward.\nThis technique promises simple implementation\nin the field. When the subgrade is identified as\neither cohesive or noncohesive, a mat with the\nappropriate cable passage concavity is easily constructed. The machine is then mounted and energized. If no excessive vibration is experienced,\nno further adjustment is necessary. If vibration\nis excessive, cables are mounted in the passages,\nfastened at one end, and tightened at the other\nend by a hydraulic jack reacting against the edge\nof the mat. Cable tension can be varied until\nvibration is minimized, whereupon the cables are\nsecurely fastened to the mat edge and the jack\nremoved.\nSeveral cables may be mounted parallel to each\nother, and passages may be provided to allow\ntightening from front to back, and from side to\nside.\n\nNotes:\n\nI. The assumption that altering the rigidity of the\nmat and the subgrade pressure distribution will\nchange the mat-subgrade system natural frequency has not yet been validated by testing.\n2. This technique should provide a simple and\neffective correction procedure for equipment\nvibration until more accurate methods are\ndevised for determining soil vibration characteristics.\n3.
