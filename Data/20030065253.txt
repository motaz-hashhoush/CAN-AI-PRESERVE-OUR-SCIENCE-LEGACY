The document is organized into 7 separate volumes as:\nOcean Optics Protocols for Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4\nVolume I: Introduction, Background and Conventions\nVolume II: Instrument Specifications, Characterization and Calibration\nVolume III: Radiometric Measurements and Data Analysis Methods\nVolume IV: Inherent Optical Properties: Instruments, Characterization, Field Measurements and Data\nAnalysis Protocols\nVolume V: Biogeochemical and Bio-Optical Measurements and Data Analysis Methods\nVolume VI: Special Topics in Ocean Optics Protocols\nThe earlier version of Ocean Optics Protocols for Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 3 (Mueller\nand Fargion 2002, Volumes 1 and 2) is entirely superseded by the seven Volumes of Revision 4 listed above.\nThe new multi-volume format for publishing the ocean optics protocols is intended to allow timely future\nrevisions to be made reflecting important evolution of instruments and methods in some areas, without reissuing the\nentire document. Over the years, as existing protocols were revised, or expanded for clarification, and new protocol\ntopics were added, the ocean optics protocol document has grown from 45pp (Mueller and Austin 1992) to 308pp in\nRevision 3 (Mueller and Fargion 2002). This rate of growth continues in Revision 4. The writing and editorial tasks\nneeded to publish each revised version of the protocol manual as a single document has become progressively more\ndifficult as its size increases. Chapters that change but little, must nevertheless be rewritten for each revision to\nreflect relatively minor changes in, e.g., cross-referencing and to maintain self-contained consistency in the protocol\nmanual. More critically, as it grows bigger, the book becomes more difficult to use by its intended audience. A\nmassive new protocol manual is difficult for a reader to peruse thoroughly enough to stay current with and apply\nimportant new material and revisions it may contain. Many people simply find it too time consuming to keep up\nwith changing protocols presented in this format - which may explain why some relatively recent technical reports\nand journal articles cite Mueller and Austin (1995), rather than the then current, more correct protocol document. It\nis hoped that the new format will improve community access to current protocols by stabilizing those volumes and\nchapters that do not change significantly over periods of several years, and introducing most new major revisions as\nnew chapters to be added to an existing volume without revision of its previous contents.\nThe relationships between the Revision 4 chapters of each protocol volume and those of Revision 3 (Mueller\nand Fargion 2002), and the topics new chapters, are briefly summarized below:\nVolume I: This volume covers perspectives on ocean color research and validation (Chapter 1), fundamental\ndefinitions, terminology, relationships and conventions used throughout the protocol document (Chapter 2),\nrequirements for specific in situ observations (Chapter 3), and general protocols for field measurements, metadata,\nlogbooks, sampling strategies, and data archival (Chapter 4). Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of Volume I correspond directly to\nChapters 1, 2 and 3 of Revision 3 with no substantive changes. Two new variables, Particulate Organic Carbon\n(POC) and Particle Size Distribution (PSD) have been added to Tables 3.1 and 3.2 and the related discussion in\nSection 3.4; protocols covering these measurements will be added in a subsequent revision to Volume V (see\nbelow). Chapter 4 of Volume I combines material from Chapter 9 of Revision 3 with a brief summary of SeaBASS\npolicy and archival requirements (detailed SeaBASS information in Chapter 18 and Appendix B of Revision 3 has\nbeen separated from the optics protocols).\nVolume II: The chapters of this volume review instrument performance characteristics required for in situ\nobservations to support validation (Chapter 1), detailed instrument specifications and underlying rationale (Chapter\n2) and protocols for instrument calibration and characterization standards and methods (Chapters 3 through 5).\nChapters 1 through 5 of Volume II correspond directly to Revision 3 chapters 4 through 8, respectively, with only\nminor modifications.\n\ni\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nVolume III: The chapters of this volume briefly review methods used in the field to make the in situ\nradiometric measurements for ocean color validation, together with methods of analyzing the data (Chapter 1),\ndetailed measurement and data analysis protocols for in-water radiometric profiles (Chapter 2), above water\nmeasurements of remote sensing reflectance (Chapter III-3), determinations of exact normalized water-leaving\nradiance (Chapter 4), and atmospheric radiometric measurements to determine aerosol optical thickness and sky\nradiance distributions (Chapter 5). Chapter 1 is adapted from relevant portions of Chapter 9 in Revision 3. Chapter\n2 of Volume III corresponds to Chapter 10 of Revision 3, and Chapters 3 through 5 to Revision 3 Chapters 12\nthrough 14, respectively. Aside from reorganization, there are no changes in the protocols presented in this volume.\nVolume IV: This volume includes a chapter reviewing the scope of inherent optical properties (IOP)\nmeasurements (Chapter 1), followed by 4 chapters giving detailed calibration, measurement and analysis protocols\nfor the beam attenuation coefficient (Chapter 2), the volume absorption coefficient measured in situ (Chapter 3),\nlaboratory measurements of the volume absorption coefficients from discrete filtered seawater samples (Chapter 4),\nand in situ measurements of the volume scattering function, including determinations of the backscattering\ncoefficient (Chapter 5). Chapter 4 of Volume IV is a slightly revised version of Chapter 15 in Revision 3, while the\nremaining chapters of this volume are entirely new contributions to the ocean optics protocols. These new chapters\nmay be significantly revised in the future, given the rapidly developing state-of-the-art in IOP measurement\ninstruments and methods.\nVolume V: The overview chapter (Chapter 1) briefly reviews biogeochemical and bio-optical measurements,\nand points to literature covering methods for measuring these variables; some of the material in this overview is\ndrawn from Chapter 9 of Revision 3. Detailed protocols for HPLC measurement of phytoplankton pigment\nconcentrations are given in Chapter 2, which differs from Chapter 16 of Revision 3 only by its specification of a new\nsolvent program. Chapter 3 gives protocols for Fluorometric measurement of chlorophyll a concentration, and is not\nsignificantly changed from Chapter 17of Revision 3. New chapters covering protocols for measuring, Phycoerythrin\nconcentrations, Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) concentrations are likely\nfuture additions to this volume.\nVolume VI: This volume gathers chapters covering more specialized topics in the ocean optics protocols.\nChapter 1 introduces these special topics in the context of the overall protocols. Chapter 2 is a reformatted, but\notherwise unchanged, version of Chapter 11 in Revision 3 describing specialized protocols used for radiometric\nmeasurements associated with the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) ocean color vicarious calibration observatory.\nThe remaining chapters are new in Revision 4 and cover protocols for radiometric and bio-optical measurements\nfrom moored and drifting buoys (Chapter 3), ocean color measurements from aircraft (Chapter 4), and methods and\nresults using LASER sources for stray-light characterization and correction of the MOBY spectrographs (Chapter 5).\nIn the next few years, it is likely that most new additions to the protocols will appear as chapters added to this\nvolume.\nVolume VI: also collects appendices of useful information. Appendix A is an updated version of Appendix A\nin Revision 3 summarizing characteristics of past, present and future satellite ocean color missions. Appendix B is\nthe List of Acronyms used in the report and is an updated version of Appenix C in Revision 3. Similarly, Appendix\nC, the list of Frequently Used Symbols, is an updated version of Appendix D from Rev. 3. The SeaBASS file\nformat information given in Appendix B of Revision 3 has been removed from the protocols and is promulgated\nseparately by the SIMBIOS Project.\nIn the Revision 4 multi-volume format of the ocean optics protocols, Volumes I, II and III are unlikely to\nrequire significant changes for several years. The chapters of Volume IV may require near term revisions to reflect\nthe rapidly evolving state-of-the-art in measurements of inherent optical properties, particularly concerning\ninstruments and methods for measuring the Volume Scattering Function of seawater. It is anticipated that new\nchapters will be also be added to Volumes V and VI in Revision 5 (2003).\nThis technical report is not meant as a substitute for scientific literature. Instead, it will provide a ready and\nresponsive vehicle for the multitude of technical reports issued by an operational Project. The contributions are\npublished as submitted, after only minor editing to correct obvious grammatical or clerical errors.\n\nii\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation,

The roles of the IOP in radiative transfer descriptions\nand models of light propagation in the sea are also introduced in Vol. I, Ch. 2, and appear elsewhere in many of the\nVolumes and Chapters of this protocol document.\nThe chapters of this volume (Vol. IV) describe the conceptual background, instrument characteristics, and\nmethods of calibration, field measurements and data analysis for determining the IOP of seawater. The scope of this\nprotocol volume is limited to practical methods for using commercially available instruments1 to determine the IOP\nidentified in Vol. I, Chapter 3 (Table 3.1) of Ocean Optics Protocols for Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation,\nRev. 4. The scope of the present volume does not include applications of measured IOP to aspects of ocean color\nsensor validation that are described elsewhere in the document. The role of IOP in the determination of Exact\nNormalized Water-Leaving Radiance Lex ( \xce\xbb ) as a function of wavelength \xce\xbb, for example, is discussed in Vol. III,\nWN\nChapter 4.\nIn this chapter we extend the IOP definitions and relationships of Vol. I, Ch. 2 to develop the theoretical and\nmathematical bases for practical instrument concepts and methods for measuring IOP in seawater. Instruments will\nbe described to measure, in situ at depth z, the beam attenuation coefficient c ( z , \xce\xbb ) , the volume absorption\ncoefficient a ( z , \xce\xbb ) , and the volume scattering function (VSF) \xce\xb2 ( z , \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) at one or more scattering angles \xcf\x88 .\nSpectrophotometric laboratory methods are also described in detail for determining absorption coefficients from\nfiltered, discrete water samples. Methods of data analysis are described to determine, from combinations of these\nmeasurements, the volume scattering coefficient b ( z , \xce\xbb ) and backscattering coefficient bb ( z , \xce\xbb ) .\nWe do not consider instrument concepts or methods for measuring either fluorescence, or Raman scattering, in\nVol. IV. Even though the Raman and fluorescence cross-sections of water, suspended particles and dissolved\nmaterials are also IOP of seawater, only elastic scattering processes are considered in this volume.\nIn the remainder of Vol. IV, we will ordinarily omit the explicit notation identifying IOP variables as functions\nof depth z in the water column. This is partly a desire for simplifying the notation, but the more important motive is\nto avoid confusing global coordinates (geographic location and vertical depth in the water column) with local\ncoordinates (optical axes and normal planes) used to describe photon-matter interactions and measurement concepts.\n\n1\n\nCertain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this chapter to foster understanding.\nSuch identification does not imply recommendation, or endorsement, by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the\npurpose.\n1\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\n1.2 ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING PROPERTIES OF WATER,\nPARTICLES AND DISSOLVED SUBSTANCES\nBecause the IOP are additive (Vol. I, Ch. 2, Sect. 2.4), the absorption and scattering properties of natural water\nconsists of the sums of these IOP of pure water, suspended particles, dissolved substances and turbulence. It is very\ndifficult to experimentally determine the absorption of pure water in the laboratory, due principally to the difficulty\nof making and maintaining pure water during the course of an experiment. Nevertheless, there have been several\nsuccessful experiments (several are cited below), over the past few decades, and the spectral absorption and\nscattering coefficients of pure water are reasonably well known. Using this information, several types of IOP\ninstruments are calibrated by measuring their responses using pure water as an \xe2\x80\x9coptical standard\xe2\x80\x9d. Thus, the\ncalibrated responses of these instruments in field measurements represent the IOP of particles and dissolved\nmaterial, independent of water. IOP.\nFrom another perspective, the general characteristics of absorption and scattering properties vary spectrally, and\nin the case of scattering angularly, between the different optically important constituents of seawater. The contrast\nin angular distribution characteristics of scattering by water and by particles can be an important element of\ninstrument design concepts.\nAbsorption by Pure Water\nThe spectral values recommended in Vol. I, Ch. 2 (Sect. 2.4) for the volume absorption coefficients of pure\n-1\nwater, aw(\xce\xbb) m , are those of Sogandares and Fry (1997) for wavelengths between 340 nm and 380 nm, Pope and\nFry (1997) for wavelengths between 380 nm and 700 nm, and Smith and Baker (1981) for wavelengths between\n700 nm and 800 nm. Here, for wavelengths > 700 nm we recommend values calculated by Van Zee et al. (2002)\nfrom the imaginary part of the refractive indices for pure water measured by Kou et al. (1993). The composite\naw ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum derived from these sources is listed in Table 1.1, together with the linear temperature dependency\n\xe2\x88\x82aw ( \xce\xbb )\n\xe2\x88\x82T\n\n\xef\xa3\xae m -1 \xc2\xb0C \xef\xa3\xb9 reported by Pegau and Zaneveld (1993) and Pegau et al. (1997).\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\nAbsorption by Suspended Particulates and Colored Dissolved Organic Material (CDOM)\nVariations in the spectral absorption of natural waters result directly from variantions in the concentrations and\nchemical compositions of material substances distributed within the water volume. These absorbing materials may\nbe present in seawater either in suspended particulates, such as pigment-bearing phytoplankton, or as solutes (i.e.\nCDOM). Fig. 1.1a illustrates qualitative comparisons between the absorption spectrum of pure water, aw ( \xce\xbb )\n\xe2\x88\x97\n(Table 1.1), a non-dimensional Chl-specific absorption spectrum of phytoplankton pigment concentration, achl ( \xce\xbb )\n\n(Prieur and Sathyendranath 1981), and a typically exponential absorption spectrum of CDOM ag ( \xce\xbb ) (Bricaud et al.\n1981). The amplitude of each absorption spectrum in Fig. 1.1a is arbitrarily scaled to illustrate the characteristic\ndifference in shapes between the constant water background absorption and two varying absorption components\nassociated with Chl and CDOM concentrations. The unique shape and magnitude of the specific absorption\nspectrum for each individual constituent allows measured values of, e.g., Chl and CDOM concentrations to be\ndetermined from measurements of a ( \xce\xbb ) at several appropriate wavelengths. The strong inverse depencence of\nremote sensing reflecance on a ( \xce\xbb ) (Vol. III, Ch. 4), together with the distinctive shape and magnitude\ncharacteristics of the constituents, similarly provides the physical basis for ocean color algorithms for determining\ntheir concentrations from satellite measurements of water leaving radiance at several wavelengths.\nIn Case 1 waters, it is often useful to assume (Gordon and Morel 1983; Morel and Maritorena 2001; Mobley\nand Sundman 2000) that particle absorption ap ( \xce\xbb ) is dominated by phytoplankton pigments and may be expressed\n\xe2\x88\x97\nas a function of Chl concentration [mg m-3] and a Chl-specific absorption spectrum achl ( \xce\xbb ) (Prieur and\n\nSathyendranath 1981), and that CDOM concentration is correlated with Chl so that ag ( \xce\xbb ) may also be calculated as\n\n2\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nFig. 1.1: Spectral variations of absorption in seawater. a: Qualitative comparison of the shapes of\nabsorption spectra of pure water (Table 1.1), specific absorption by Chl (Prieur and Sathyendranath\n1981), and CDOM as implemented in the HYDROLIGHT radiative transfer model (Mobley and\nSundman 2000) described further by Morel and Maritorena (2001). b: Comparisons between aw ( \xce\xbb ) ,\nthe absorption spectrum of pure water, and am ( \xce\xbb, Chl ) ,the sum of absorption by suspended particles and\nCDOM for Chl concentrations of 1, 3 and 10 mg m-3, following Mobley and Sundman (2000).

Fig. 1.1b shows the sum\nam ( \xce\xbb; Chl ) = ap ( \xce\xbb; Chl ) + ag ( \xce\xbb; Chl ) calculated, for Chl = 1, 3 and 10 mg m-3 , using this simple model, as\nimplemented in one of the standard IOP spcification options within the HYDROLIGHT radiative transfer model\n(Mobley and Sundman 2000). The subscript \xe2\x80\x9cm\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that the spectra shown in Fig. 1.1b are those that would\nbe measured by an instrument that was calibrated using pure water as a standard reference medium (Chapter 3). The\nabsorption of pure water aw ( \xce\xbb ) is compared with am ( \xce\xbb; Chl ) in Fig. 1.1b, and the corresponsding total absorption\ncoefficient spectra a ( \xce\xbb; Chl ) = aw ( \xce\xbb ) + am ( \xce\xbb; Chl ) are illustrated in Fig. 1.1c.\n\nThe illustrated examples are\n\nadmittedly an oversimplification, but they are adequate as a basis for considering the nature of IOP components of\nthe signal measured by an absorption meter, or transmissometer, at individual wavelengths.\nScattering by Pure Water\nThe spectral values of the pure water volume scattering coefficient bw ( \xce\xbb ) recommended in Vol. I, Chapter 2\n(Sect. 2.4) are those of Morel (1974), as reported by Smith and Baker (1981). Following Van Zee et al. (2002),\nhowever, we recommend here that preference be given to the bw ( \xce\xbb ) scales of Buiteveld, et al. (1994). Both scales\nare listed in Table 1.1 for comparison. The difference between the two scales is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.0001 m -1 at wavelengths\n> 475 nm, increases to \xe2\x89\xa4 0.0005 m -1 as wavelength decreases to 400 nm, and increases further to \xe2\x89\xa4 0.0014 m -1 at\n340 nm. In no instance does the difference closely approach the 0.005 m -1 measurement uncertainty of beam\nattenuation and absorption meters that are commercially available to date.\nThe angular distribution of the molecular scattering phase function \xce\xb2w ( \xcf\x88 ) , as approximated with equation\n(2.29) [Vol. I, Ch. 2] , is illustrated in Fig. 1.2. The magnitude of \xce\xb2w ( \xcf\x88 ) represents the probability that a photon\nscattering interaction with a water molecule will redirect the photon path direction by an angle \xcf\x88 measured from its\noriginal path. The shape of \xce\xb2w ( \xcf\x88 ) is sometimes referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cisotropic\xe2\x80\x9d in the literature, a characterization that is\ntrue only in that the function is axially symmetric and the probabilities of forward and backward scattering are equal.\n\nFig. 1.2: The dashed curve represent the angular distribution of the scattering phase function for pure water,\ncalculated using the approximate Rayleigh scattering model [equation (2.29) of Vol. I, Ch. 2].\n\n5\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nScattering by Particles\nIn many natural waters, the volume scattering coefficient for particles bp ( \xce\xbb ) is comparable to, or larger than,\nthat of pure water. Moreover, the shape of a particle scattering phase function \xce\xb2w ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) , an example of which is\nillustrated as the solid curve in Fig. 1.3, is strongly peaked - by several orders of magnitude - in the forward\ndirection. The extreme contrast between the angular probability distributions of particulate and molecular scattering\n(the dashed curve in Fig. 1.3) are important factors that must be considered when designing transmissometers and\nscattering meters for use in the sea.\n\nFig. 1.3: The solid curve is an example of a measured scattering phase function for ocean water dominated by\nparticle scattering (Petzold 1972; San Diego Harbor Stn. 2040). The dashed curve is the pure water phase function\nfrom Fig. 1.2, shown here for comparison.\nScattering by Turbulence\nRandom fluctuations in water density, induced by turbulence, act to steer photons through very small angles in\nthe forward direction, and therefore, scattering by turbulence is also strongly peaked, by orders of magnitude, in the\nforward direction. Because turbulent fluctuations are completely random in space and time, the variance of photons\nscattered by turbulence at small angles is much greater than the variance associated with small angle scattering by\nparticles (Bogucki et al. 1998)\n\n1.3 RADIANT FLUX TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENT CONCEPTS\nGeometry and Nomenclature\nIn Fig. 1.4 the origin of a local instrument coordinate system is placed at the exit aperture of a source of\nmonochromatic radiant flux \xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, 0 ) \xef\xa3\xaein \xc2\xb5W nm -1 \xef\xa3\xb9 2 directed as a collimated beam along the positive zm-axis\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n\xcb\x86 \xcb\x86 \xcb\x86\n(see also Fig. 2.2 in Vol. I, Ch. 2). The subscript \xe2\x80\x9cm\xe2\x80\x9d associated with the coordinate basis vectors ( x m , y m , z m ) in\n\n2\n\nThe choice of these units, rather than, e.g., W m -1 , is customary in ocean color science and is used throughout\nthese protocols.\n6\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nFig. 1.4 indicate that the local \xe2\x80\x9cmeasurement\xe2\x80\x9d coordinate frame is associated with a particular instrument concept, as\ndistinguished from global coordinates defining positions and directions in the extended medium (cf Figs. 2.1 and 2.2\nin Vol. I, Ch. 2). The local instrument coordinate framework is related to global coordinates by a translation and\nrotations that are arbitrary and need not be considered in the present context3.\nThe direction associated with an optical path vector intersecting the transmitted beam axis (zm-axis) is described\nby the angle pair ( \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) , where 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 \xcf\x88 \xe2\x89\xa4 \xcf\x80 is measured from the zm-axis and 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 \xcf\x95 \xe2\x89\xa4 2\xcf\x80 is measured from the\nxm-axis counterclockwise in the xmym-plane. The variable r , with various subscripts, will denote geometric\ndistance along any such optical path4. Directional radiant flux at distance r from a source, or from a scattering\ninteraction site within the transmitted beam, is denoted \xce\xa6 ( \xce\xbb, r , \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) . In Fig. 1.4 for example, radiometric flux\nscattered into direction ( \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) at position xS is denoted as \xce\xa6S ( \xce\xbb, 0, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) , and the scattered flux transmitted in that\ndirection to Detector 2, at position x D , as \xce\xa6S ( \xce\xbb, rD , \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) . Radiometric flux within the beam transmitted to a point\non the zm-axis at distance r from the source is denoted, \xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, r , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) , where the dot indicates that \xcf\x95 is\nindeterminate when \xcf\x88 = 0 or \xcf\x88 = \xcf\x80 .\n\nIn particular, the flux transmitted from the source to Detector 1 is\n\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) .\n\nTransmittance and Beam Attenuation\nThe shaded rectangle overlaid on the extended zm-axis in Fig. 1.4 schematically illustrates a cylinder (of cross\nsectional area \xe2\x88\x86s ) representing the collimated beam of radiant flux transmitted from the source to Detector 1. The\ngradient in shading represents the exponential decrease in \xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, r , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) with increasing distance r, as photons\ninteract with the medium and are absorbed and scattered out of the beam. During transmission over a path interval\nfrom r to r + \xe2\x88\x86r , the fraction of radiant flux absorbed in the volume \xe2\x88\x86s\xe2\x88\x86r is spectral absorptance, A ( \xce\xbb ) and the\nfraction of flux scattered out of the beam direction in that volume is spectral scatterance B ( \xce\xbb ) (see Vol. I, Chapter\n2, Sect. 2.4).\nOne could envision superimposing a lightly shaded \xe2\x80\x9ccloud\xe2\x80\x9d on Fig. 1.4 to visualize scattered photons escaping\nfrom the beam in all directions, but this would not indicate the directional nature of the scattering losses. Instead,\nthe scattering process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.4 as a mottled, shaded path of photons scattered in a\nparticular direction ( \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) at a single location xS in the beam5. At this on-axis location, xS , similar beams could be\ndrawn in any other direction to visually indicate scattered flux intensity and its subsequent transmittance and\nattenuation in the new direction. The same type of graphic could be drawn anywhere along the optical path, and if\nmany were combined we\xe2\x80\x99d generate the aforementioned \xe2\x80\x9cphoton cloud\xe2\x80\x9d masking any indication of the vector nature\nof the scattered radiant field. Nevertheless, that mental construct is adequate for considering transmission\nmeasurement concepts. If the pathlength rT is short enough that photons initially scattered out of the beam have a\nnegligible chance of undergoing two (or more) additional scattering interactions that could return them to the beam,\nthen it may be assumed that they will not be detected by Detector 1 (Fig. 1.4)6.\n\n3\n\nWhen the IOP are used in the context of a radiative transfer model, on the other hand, the translations and\nrotations relating local coordinates, used to describe scattering interactions (e.g. as at position xS .in Fig. 1.3), to\nglobal coordinates, describing locations and directions in the medium as whole, become critically important.\n4\nSee Footnote 2 in (Vol. 1, Chapter 2) regarding the usage of the variable z in Fig. 2.2 and Sect. 2.4 of that chapter.\nHere we have substituted the symbol r for the optical pathlength along the z-axis in Fig. 1.3 (compare with Fig. 2.2\nof Vol. 1 Ch. 2).\n5\nThe transmission of the illustrated beam of scattered photons to Detector 2 will be further considered as a starting\npoint in the discussion of scattering measurement concepts in Sect. 1.5 below.\n6\nThe question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat pathlength limit is \xe2\x80\x98short enough\xe2\x80\x99 to avoid multiply scattered photons from reaching a\ntransmissometer\xe2\x80\x99s detector?\xe2\x80\x9d is considered in Chapter 2 of this Protocol Volume.\n7\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nFigure 1.4: The local \xe2\x80\x9cInstrument Coordinate\xe2\x80\x9d framework describing optical beam transmission and scattering\ngeometry. A collimated beam of radiometric flux \xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) is emitted from a source at the origin xo . The flux\nwithin the collimated beam, shown schematically as a gradient shaded rectangle extending along the zm-axis to\nDetector 1, is reduced by scattering and absorption as it is transmitted along the zm-axis, and a reduced flux\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) is measured by Detector 1 at position xT .

If the source and collector are equal in area and the\nwater path between them (the shaded transmission path volume in Fig. 1.4) were enclosed in a perfectly reflecting\ntube, then all forward scattered photons would be redirected into the beam and reach the detector. For the present,\nwe will postpone consideration of the flux loss due to backscattered photons and treat it as being negligible.

In recent years, this method has been adapted for use in the ocean (Zaneveld et al. 1992).\nSuitable instruments are now commercially available and are coming into general use within the oceanographic\ncommunity. The best-known, commercially available example of this type of instrument is the \xe2\x80\x9cac-9\xe2\x80\x9d manufactured\nby WET Labs Inc. of Philomath, OR. Protocols for calibrating and using reflecting tube absorption meters, and\nmethods of data analysis are described in Chapter 3 of this volume, and in more specific detail for the ac-9 by Van\nZee et al. (2002), which is available at (www.wetlabs.com).\n\n9\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nLaboratory Methods for Determining Absorption Coefficients\nProtocols in Chapter 4, by Mitchell et al., describe methods for filtering seawater to capture suspended particles\non GF/F filters, and for measuring the absorption spectra of the particle-laden filters with a laboratory\nspectrophotometer. Methods are also described for extracting phytoplankton pigments from the filters, and\nmeasuring the residual absorption spectrum of particulate materials other than phytoplankton pigments. Finally,\nlaboratory methods are also described for measuring the absorption spectrum of CDOM in filtered seawater\nsamples. The material in this chapter derives from the results of recent experimental intercomparison workshops in\nwhich the authors participated, as well as from the published literature. Chapter 4 of this volume is a reformatted,\nbut otherwise unchanged, version of Chapter 15 in Revision 3 to the ocean optics protocols (Mueller and Fargion\n2002).\nAbsorption Determinations from Radiometric Measurements of Irradiance Flux Divergence\nIn situ spectral absorption coefficient profiles can also be measured with spectral radiometers conforming to the\nperformance specifications listed in Vol. II, Chapter 2, if the radiometric package is extended to measure Ed(z,\xce\xbb) and\no\n\no\n\nEu(z,\xce\xbb), as well as scalar irradiances Ed ( z , \xce\xbb ) and Eu ( z , \xce\xbb ) . This combination may be approached either using\nhemispherical collectors to measure upwelling and downwelling hemispherical irradiances (Hojerslev 1975), or by\nusing cosine collectors on one radiometer in tandem with spherical collectors on another radiometer. Given these\nirradiance components, spectral absorption is then computed using Gershun\'s equation (Gershun 1939) as\na ( z, \xce\xbb ) = K ( z, \xce\xbb )\n\nE ( z, \xce\xbb )\no\n\nE ( z, \xce\xbb )\n\n,\n\n(1.11)\n\nwhere E ( z , \xce\xbb ) = Ed ( z , \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 Eu ( z , \xce\xbb ) is vector irradiance, K ( z , \xce\xbb ) is the vertical attenuation coefficient for vector\no\n\no\n\no\n\nirradiance, and scalar irradiance E ( z , \xce\xbb ) = Ed ( z , \xce\xbb ) + Eu ( z , \xce\xbb ) (see also Vol. I, Chapter 2).\no\n\nComparisons between absorption profiles measured using Gershun\'s equation with E ( z , \xce\xbb ) and E ( z , \xce\xbb ) (scalar\nirradiance) data, and absorption profiles measured with a reflecting tube instrument, agreed within 8% (Pegau et al.\n1994). This level of agreement is well within the calibration uncertainties of the particular prototype instruments\nused for that experiment, which were approximately 10% uncertainties in both the scalar irradiance radiometer and\nin the reflecting tube instrument. Less than 5% uncertainties in absorption are expected in future experiments,\nassuming the data are properly averaged to remove near-surface irradiance fluctuations caused by surface waves\n(Zaneveld et al. 2001). In very clear oligotrophic water, moreover, uncertainty in water absorption values may make\nit impossible to realize this level of relative agreement.\nOther Methods of Measuring Absorption\nThere are several other measurement concepts that may be used to determine the absorption coefficient of\nseawater, however, none of them are currently useful for making routine measurements during daylight conditions at\nsea. One possible exception is the determination of absorption by inverting radiance distribution profiles measured\nusing a camera system (Voss 1989), but at present, such camera systems are not commercially available7. In a\nsimilar method, absorption may be determined by inverting the radiative transfer equation for several measured\nmoments of an axially symmetric radiance distribution in the asymptotic regime (Zaneveld and Pak 1972; Wells\n1983) Other examples include the determination aw ( \xce\xbb ) using an integrating cavity (Pope and Fry 1997),\nphotothermal methods (Sogandares and Fry 1997), and differential optoacoustic spectroscopy (Voss and Trees\n1987). Optoacoustic spectroscopy was also used to measure ap ( \xce\xbb ) in phytoplankton cultures (Trees and Voss\n1990). Absorption may also be determined from measurements of irradiance divergence from a submerged isotropic\n7\n\nIt would be advantageous were this situation to change in the future, as such camera systems are potentially even\nmore useful for determining the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Exact Normalized\nWater-Leaving Radiance (Vol. III, Ch. 4).\n10\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nsource (Maffione et al. 1993, and earlier references cited there). The present version of this volume does not\naddress any of these methods.\n\n1.5 SCATTERING MEASUREMENT CONCEPTS\nScattering Coefficient Determinations\nThere is no practical way to directly measure the volume scattering coefficient b ( \xce\xbb ) . Given measurements of\nabsorption and beam attenuation coefficients, however, the volume scattering coefficient may computed from (1.1)\nas b ( \xce\xbb ) = c ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 a ( \xce\xbb ) , m -1 . In practice it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite that simple, and several interrelated scattering and absorption\ncorrections must be applied (Chapters 3 and 5 in this Volume). Alternatively, attempts have been made to calculate\nb ( \xce\xbb ) by integrating measurements of the VSF, e.g., by Petzold (1972).\nVolume Scattering Function Measurements\nIn Fig. 1.4, the combination of the source at xo , directional scattering at xS , and Detector 2 at location x D\n\nschematically illustrate the conceptual elements of a scattering meter designed to measure the VSF \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) .\nCollimated flux \xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) is transmitted, in a beam of cross-sectional area A, from the source to xS as\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rS , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) = \xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) e\xe2\x88\x92 c ( \xce\xbb ) rS .\n\n(1.12)\n\nThe irradiance incident normal to the optical transmission axis at xS is\nEi =\n\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rS , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 )\n\n=\n\n\xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) e\xe2\x88\x92 c ( \xce\xbb ) rS\n\n.\n(1.13)\nA\nA\nAt position xS , some of the incident radiant flux is scattered in direction ( \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) , into the solid angle field-of-view\n\xe2\x84\xa6 FOV of Detector 1, from the volume V ( \xcf\x88 ) defined by the intersection of the beam and detector field of view. The\n\nradiant intensity of the scattered flux is\nI S ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 , \xcf\x95 ) =\n\n\xce\xa6S ( \xce\xbb, 0, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 )\n\n,\n\n\xe2\x84\xa6 FOV\n\n(1.14)\n\nand scattered flux reaching the detector is\n\xce\xa6S ( \xce\xbb, rD , \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) = \xce\xa6 S ( \xce\xbb, 0, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) e\xe2\x88\x92 c ( \xce\xbb ) rD .\n\n(1.15)\n\nFrom equation (2.30) we may determine the VSF averaged over the working volume and solid angle FOV\napproximately as\n\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) \xe2\x89\x85\n\nI S ( \xce\xbb, 0, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 )\nEiV ( \xcf\x88 )\n\n,\n\n(1.16)\n\nor by substituting from (1.12) through (1.13), directly in terms of source and detector fluxes as\n\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) \xe2\x89\x85\n\n\xce\xa6S ( \xce\xbb, rD , \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) A\n\n\xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) V ( \xcf\x88 ) \xe2\x84\xa6 FOV\n\ne\n\n\xe2\x88\x92 c ( \xce\xbb ) ( rS \xe2\x88\x92 rD )\n\n.\n\n(1.17)\n\nOne must know both c ( \xce\xbb ) and \xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) to determine the VSF from (1.17). If the same detector were used\nat positions shown for detectors 1 and 2 in Fig. 1.4, following the method introduced by Kullenberg (1968), and if\nrD = rT \xe2\x88\x92 rS , we may substitute from (1.7) and determine the VSF from the two measured detector fluxes as\n\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) \xe2\x89\x85\n\n\xce\xa6S ( \xce\xbb, rD , \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) A\n\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) V ( \xcf\x88 ) \xe2\x84\xa6 FOV\n\n11\n\n.\n\n(1.18)\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nEquation (1.18) could be used to measure the VSF if the source and detector are well collimated, and there were\nno flux losses, or FOV distortions, associated with an instrument\xe2\x80\x99s optical assembly. For most scattering meters,\nhowever, the averaged VSF estimate \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) is related to the true VSF \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) by a weighted integral\n\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) =\n\n2\xcf\x80 \xcf\x80\n\n\xe2\x88\xab \xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 )W ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95; c ) sin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88d \xcf\x95 .\n\n(1.19)\n\n0 0\n\nwhere the weighting function W ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95; c ) accounts for instrumental factors including the divergence and\nuniformity of the source beam and detector angular response function, the working volume geometry, variations in\nattenuation of flux scattered to the detector from different volume elements, and optical reflection and absorption\nlosses in the system. Practical methods for determining W ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95; c ) are described in Chapter 5.\nThe VSF of ocean water is usually considered to be azimuthally symmetric about the transmission axis.\nTherefore, the VSF is usually reported as \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) , which is a function of the polar \xe2\x80\x9cscattering angle\xe2\x80\x9d alone. In\nterms of the VSF measurements as represented in (1.19), we have that\n\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) =\n\n2\xcf\x80\n\n\xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) d \xcf\x95 = 2\xcf\x80\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) .\n\n(1.20)\n\n0\n\nBackscattering Coefficient Determination\nThe backscattering coefficient bb ( \xce\xbb ) [Vol. I, Ch. 2, equation (2.23)] is an important factor in the physical\nrelationship between the IOP and remote sensing reflectance (Vol. III, Ch. 4, Sect. 4.3 and references cited therein).\nAs is the case for the volume scattering coefficient b ( \xce\xbb ) , there is no practical way to directly measure bb ( \xce\xbb ) in the\nsea. If that is true, then how can bb ( \xce\xbb ) be determined using the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cbackscattering meters\xe2\x80\x9d in common use\nwithin the community? These instruments actually measure the VSF \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) at one angle \xcf\x88\xe2\x88\x97 , or several angles\n\xcf\x88\xe2\x88\x97 , i = 1, 2,\xe2\x80\xa6 , N , in the backward direction. For single angle VSF instruments, such as the HOBILABS HydroScati\nseries and WET Labs ECO-BB series , one uses the fact that most observed phase functions and modeled VSFs\nshow a common crossover angle \xcf\x88\xe2\x88\x97 at which \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88\xe2\x88\x97 ) \xe2\x88\x9d bb ( \xce\xbb ) . An empirical linear equation is used to calculate\n\nbb ( \xce\xbb ) from \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88\xe2\x88\x97 ) ; where the angle \xcf\x88\xe2\x88\x97 is selected to minimize the uncertainty in bb ( \xce\xbb ) associated with a\n\nsimulated uncertainty in \xce\xb2P ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) (Oishi 1990; Maffione and Dana; Boss and Pegau 2001). The approach used to\ndetermine bb ( \xce\xbb ) from measurements of \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 i , \xcf\x95 ) ; i = 1, 2,\xe2\x80\xa6 , N angles, e.g. using a WET Labs VSF-3, is to fit a\npolynomial to the N+1 values 2\xcf\x80\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 i , \xcf\x95 ) sin \xcf\x88 i derived from the N measurements and the endpoint\n2\xcf\x80\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x80, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) sin \xcf\x80 \xe2\x89\xa1 0 and integrate it from\n\n\xcf\x80\nto \xcf\x80 (following Beardsley and Zaneveld 1969).\n2\n\nREFERENCES\nBeardsley, G.F. and J.R.V.

The two variables are related by equation (1.6). A beam\n\xef\xa3\xb0 \xef\xa3\xbb\ntransmissometer is an instrument that combines a source of collimated spectral radiant flux \xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) and a co-\n\naligned detector, to measure the flux \xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) transmitted over distance rT , to measure T ( \xce\xbb, rT ) (Fig. 1.4 and\nrelated text in Sect. 1.3, Ch. 1). A beam transmissometer is also frequently called a beam attenuation meter, or a cmeter.\n\n2.2 TRANSMISSOMETER DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS\nIn concept, a beam transmissometer is a relatively simple instrument to build, and the derived beam attenuation\ncoefficient is needed in many optical studies of the sea. Therefore, instruments of this type have been in use for\nmany years. While a great number of different transmissometer designs have appeared, most follow one of the two\nbasic designs illustrated in Fig. 2.1.\nDirect and Folded Path Transmissometers\nProbably the most common transmissometer design uses a collimated light beam8, with a source in one housing\nand a detector facing the source (Fig. 2.1, top panel). In such an ideal direct-path transmissometer, either a white\nlight, or a light emitting diode (LED), source is combined with a pinhole to provide a point source. A lens is\ninserted into the path to collimate the light beam, an interference filter is inserted to select the waveband of the\nmeasurement, and the light is passed into the water through a window. At the other end of the optical path, the light\nenters the detector assembly through another window and is focused by a lens. An aperture at the focal point\nremoves off-axis scattered light, and the transmitted light falls on the detector. Although this instrument is\nconceptually simple, it is difficult to build. The alignment of components is critical, and something as simple as the\nfilament in the source sagging as the instrument is moved can create significant apparent changes in the derived\nbeam attenuation coefficient.\nSeveral commercial transmissometers9 including, some laboratory\n8\n\nCylindrically limited beam, as opposed to collimated beam, transmissometers will be discussed later in this\nsection.\n9\nCertain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this chapter to foster understanding.\nSuch identification does not imply recommendation, or endorsement, by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the\npurpose.\n15\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nspectrophotometers, and the (former) SeaTech and WET Labs field instruments use this basic design. Design\nvariations include the addition of a reference detector and placing the wavelength filter in the detector housing.\nThe folded pathlength design (Fig. 2.1, bottom panel) uses one or more reflectors to create a longer pathlength.\nThe basic idea for this design can be attributed to Petterson (1934). Initial designs used plane mirrors to expand the\npathlength (Wattenberg, 1938; Timofeeva, 1960). The introduction of prisms to separate the incident and reflected\nbeam (Nikolayev and Zhil\xe2\x80\x99tsov 1968; Petzold and Austin 1968) and of concave mirrors as the reflectors, have led to\nimproved versions of this general design. An optical pathlength of 10 m was achieved by Jerlov (1957) by using\nmultiple reflections between three concave mirrors. A currently available commercial instrument with a folded path\nis the HOBILabs c meter.\n\nFig. 2.1 Schematic illustrations of direct path (top panel) and folded path (bottom panel) beam transmissometers\ndesigns.\n\nOther Types of Transmissometers\nA variable pathlength transmissometer is probably the most desirable, and elusive, c-meter design concept.\nOne desirable factor would be such an instrument\xe2\x80\x99s ability to adjust the pathlength to make it optimal for the\nmeasuring conditions (see Pathlength Considerations, below). More importantly, the variable pathlength instrument\nis self-calibrating. To understand this property of such an instrument, examine the basic equation (1.6) for\ntransmissometer measurements. For any transmissometer measurement over pathlength ri , the dark-corrected\ndetector output VT ( \xce\xbb, ri ) is proportional to the flux reaching the detector window \xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, ri , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) .\n\nIf two\n\ntransmissometer measurements are made using different path lengths, r1 and r2 , the transmittance over the\npathlength difference between the two measurements is simply\nT ( \xce\xbb, r2 \xe2\x88\x92 r1 ) \xe2\x89\xa1\n\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, r2 , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 )\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, r1 , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 )\n\n16\n\n=\n\nVT ( \xce\xbb, r2 )\nVT ( \xce\xbb, r2 )\n\n,\n\n(2.1)\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nand c ( \xce\xbb ) may be calculated from (1.6) with rT = r2 \xe2\x88\x92 r1 . The assumptions implicit in this calculation are that the\nbeam attenuation coefficient is constant over the time and space extents of the measurements, and that the optical\nalignment and electronic properties of the instrument also are constant over time.\nBarth et al. (1997) describe the design and application of a variable pathlength instrument for use in coastal\nwaters. However, they also note that the errors in alignment made their instrument unsuitable for clear water\napplications. The requirement to exactly repeat the optical alignment at two distances is the most difficult aspect of\nbuilding a variable pathlength instrument. Small changes in the alignment of the reference detector, or reflector will\nintroduce large errors in the beam attenuation coefficient by causing the focal point of the beam to wander relative to\nthe aperture in front of the detector. If biofouling exists, the spatial gradients in the fouling will cause VT ( \xce\xbb, ri ) to\nvary if the alignment is not perfect. Additionally, if the beam is not truly collimated, but instead has a slight\ndivergence, the beam divergence will cause a different area of the detector window to be illuminated in each\nmeasurement, and any spatial gradients in the optical properties of the window will translate into errors in c ( \xce\xbb ) .\nMany laboratory benchtop spectrophotometers have a design very similar to a collimated beam\ntransmissometer. A complication that arises when using laboratory spectrophotometers to measure beam attenuation\nis that much of the scattered light is kept in the sample by the total-internal-reflection at the glass-air interface. This\nmakes it more likely that multiply scattered light will be received at the detector. This problem can be reduced by\nthe addition of light baffles within the sample cuvette.\nSource and Detector Characteristics\nThe transmittance ratio\n\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 )\n\xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 )\n\n, i.e. the ratio of the flux transmitted to the detector window divided by\n\nthe flux entering the water at the source window, must be known to compute c ( \xce\xbb ) from (1.6). A transmissometer\ndoes not actually measure either of these quantities. A transmissometer\xe2\x80\x99s detector output signal VD ( \xce\xbb ) represents its\nresponse in the presence of flux \xce\xa6 D ( \xce\xbb ) , the part of \xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) that arrives at the detector after passing through\nthe instrument\xe2\x80\x99s detector assembly window and other optical elements (Fig. 2.1). Because of reflections and\nabsorption during transmission through windows and other optical components, \xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) > \xce\xa6 D ( \xce\xbb ) , but\ndark\nassuming the optical throughput is linear, \xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT ,0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) \xe2\x88\x9d \xce\xa6 D ( \xce\xbb ) . The detector\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdark\xe2\x80\x9d response VD ( \xce\xbb ) is any\n\nsignal output that is present when the source is off and \xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, ri , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) = 0 . If the detector\xe2\x80\x99s electrical response is\ndark\nlinear, \xce\xa6 D ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x9d \xef\xa3\xaeVD ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 VD ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 and we may write\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\ndark\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) = CD \xef\xa3\xaeVD ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 VD ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 , W nm -1 ,\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere CD is a constant, with units of \xef\xa3\xae W nm -1V -1 \xef\xa3\xb9 , accounting for the combined effects of optical losses and the\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\ndetector\xe2\x80\x99s flux responsivity.\nA measure of the flux \xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0i , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) is still required if the transmission is to be determined. A beam splitter\nbefore the source window can be used to shunt a proportion of the source light to a reference detector to provide a\nmeasure of the flux being sent into the water. Because of losses associated with the source windows and beam\nsplitter, the reference detector receives, and responds to, a flux proportional to \xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0i , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) and we have that\n(2.3)\n\xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) = CR \xef\xa3\xaeVR ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 VRdark ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 , W nm -1 ,\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\ndark\nwhere VR ( \xce\xbb ) and VR ( \xce\xbb ) are the reference detector response and ambient (dark) signals, respectively, and CR is a\nsecond system response constant.\nThe transmittance may now be written as the ratio of (2.2) and (2.3)\n\n17\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\ndark\n\xef\xa3\xaeVD ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 VD ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb,\nT ( \xce\xbb, rT ) =\n= CT\n\xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 )\n\xef\xa3\xaeVR ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 VRdark ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 )\n\nwhere CT =\n\n(2.4)\n\nCD\n.\nCR\n\nIf the source output is constant, the constant \xef\xa3\xaeVR ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 VRdark ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 may be absorbed in CT and (2.4) reduces to\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nT ( \xce\xbb, rT ) =\n\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 )\n\xce\xa6 o ( \xce\xbb, 0, 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 )\n\ndark\n= CT \xef\xa3\xaeVD ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 VD ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 ,\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n(2.5)\n\nand there is no need to use a reference detector10 output to calculate transmittance.\nDepending on a transmissometer\xe2\x80\x99s design, we must determine the coefficient CT in either (2.4) or (2.5). It is not\npractical to determine the system response constants based on first principles, because they are dependent on the\noptical component throughputs, the combined response(s) of the detector(s), and electronic circuits. Instead , a\nsystem\xe2\x80\x99s calibration constant CT [dimensionless in (2.4), or in V-1 in (2.5)] is typically determined by measuring the\ninstrument\xe2\x80\x99s output in a \xe2\x80\x9cstandard\xe2\x80\x9d medium having a known beam attenuation coefficient cSTD ( \xce\xbb ) . For\noceanographic transmissometers, the \xe2\x80\x9cstandard\xe2\x80\x9d medium is highly purified water (Sect. 2.3 below), and\ncSTD ( \xce\xbb ) = cw ( \xce\xbb ) (Ch. 1, Sect. 1.2).\nTransmissometer Response Temperature Dependence\nThe source output, responsivity of the detector, and performance of other electronic components tend to be\ntemperature dependent. This causes the calibration constants to be temperature dependent. Two approaches are\nused to remove the temperature dependence, 1) add compensating electronics that allow the voltage output to remain\nconstant over a temperature range, or 2) measure the temperature of the instrument and determine the how the\nconstants change with temperature. The first technique is used in many single-wavelength transmissometers, such\nas the Sea Tech and WET Labs transmissometers. The second approach is used in the WET Labs ac-9 spectral\nabsorption and beam attenuation meter.\nSpectral Characteristics\nMany areas of research in ocean optics require knowledge of the spectral beam attenuation coefficient c ( \xce\xbb ) at\nmore than one wavelength \xce\xbb. Several c-meters have been built to provide this spectral information. Matlack (1974)\nused an instrument with a grating monochromator to measure c ( \xce\xbb ) in the wavelength range from 385 nm to\n565 nm. Using a pair of circular wedge interference filters, Lundgren (1975) was able to measure the beam\nattenuation coefficient at wavelengths between 340 nm and 730 nm. More recent transmissometers that use a\nmonochromator as the detector include the one described by Barth et al. (1997), and the WET Labs Histar. Another\ndesign for obtaining the spectral beam attenuation coefficient utilizes several interference filters mounted in a wheel\nthat rotates them through the beam. Examples of filter-wheel c-meter designs include the VLST (Petzold and Austin\n1968) and the WET Labs ac-9 (Moore et al. 1992; Van Zee et al. 2002).\nBeam Geometry, Detector Acceptance Angle and Scattered Light\nReal transmissometers do not have perfectly collimated sources or detectors. Unlike the idealized detector\nconcept of Fig. 1.4 (Ch. 1, Sect. 1.3), a detector with a finite acceptance angle, or Field of View (FOV) \xcf\x88 FOV ,\n\nM\ndetects photons that are singly scattered in the range 0 < \xcf\x88 \xe2\x89\xa4 \xcf\x88 FOV . Therefore, the flux \xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) arriving at a\n\n10\n\nA reference detector may be used in a feedback circuit to stabilize an LED source. However, the reference\ndetector signal is not usually included in the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s data output stream in constant source output designs of\nthis type.\n18\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\ntransmissometer\xe2\x80\x99s detector assembly window and subsequently measured (see above) exceeds the true flux directly\ntransmitted along the path direction \xcf\x88 \xe2\x89\xa1 0 according to\nM\n\xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) = \xce\xa6 T ( \xce\xbb, rT , 0, \xe2\x80\xa2 ) + 2\xcf\x80\n\n\xcf\x88 FOV\n\n\xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb,\xcf\x88,\xcf\x95 ) sin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88 ,\n\n(2.6)\n\n0\n\nwhere \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) is the volume scattering function (VSF) (Ch. 1, Sect. 1.5).\n\nIn other words, because a\n\ntransmissometer measures a portion of the forward scattered light, its measurement overestimates the transmittance\nT ( \xce\xbb, rT ) and underestimates the beam attenuation coefficient calculated with equation (1.6). The acceptance angle,\nand thus the scattering error, is dependent on the optical elements of the instrument. There is no standard specified\nfor transmissometer acceptance angle, and each manufacturer may use a different one for each particular instrument\ndesign. Therefore, were the transmittance of a homogeneous water volume to be measured a number of perfectly\ncalibrated beam attenuation meters from HOBILabs, WET Labs, or Sea Tech, for example, each instrument model\nwould yield a slightly different c ( \xce\xbb ) , because of its different acceptance angle. These differences also depend on\nthe shape of VSF.\nThese considerations lead to two questions. What is the best detector acceptance angle choice for a\ntransmissometer design? What method should be used to correct the beam attenuation measurements for scattered\nlight acceptance?\nThe first question appears to have a simple answer. The above discussion and equation (2.8) would seem to\nimply that the smaller the acceptance angle, the better the measurement. That may not be correct. One must further\nconsider what is being measured when choosing the acceptance angle (Pegau et al. 1995), and particularly at very\nsmall angles, in the presence of near-forward scattering. Density fluctuations due to natural, or instrument related,\nturbulence steer the beam into random fluctuations and increase the apparent beam attenuation coefficient (Bogucki\net al. 1998) independently from ordinary molecular and particle scattering processes (Ch. 1, Sect. 1.5). How might\nthis phenomenon affect a particular application of the measurement? Were a person interested in inverting the\nspectral beam attenuation coefficient to determine particle properties, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want a beam attenuation meter\nthat is very sensitive to scattering by turbulence. For active LIDAR imaging systems, on the other hand, it may be\nimportant to know the transmittance effects due to very near forward scattering independent of the sources that may\ndominate the scattering process. From another perspective, the angular resolution of radiative transfer models tends\nto be larger than one degree, so fine angular resolution of the volume scattering coefficient and related beam\nattenuation coefficient is not needed for accurate model calculations (Mobley et al, 1993). For many such\ncalculations it is preferable to smooth the highly forward peaked phase function (Fig. 1.3, Ch. 2) and decrease the\nbeam attenuation coefficient accordingly. Gordon (1993) indicates that for irradiance level radiative transfer it is\npossible to completely disregard scattering in the first 15\xc2\xb0, an angle much larger than the acceptance angles of\ntransmissometers. Finally, from an engineering perspective, it is more difficult to build a stable transmissometer\nwith a very small acceptance angle. Based on these considerations, most transmissometers are designed with an\nacceptance angle < 1\xc2\xb0 .\nThe second question has been addressed by several investigators over the years (Gumprecht and Sliepcevich,\n1953; Jones and Wills, 1956; Jerlov, 1957; Duntley, 1963; Voss and Austin, 1993). Voss and Austin (1993)\nexamined the scattering error for both collimated beam and cylindrically limited instruments designs. They found\nthat the percent error increases with increasing acceptance angle and with increasing c ( \xce\xbb ) . The average error for a\n670 nm transmissometer with a 1.0\xc2\xb0 acceptance angle is approximately 19%. However, accurate correction of an\napparent cM ( \xce\xbb ) measured by that instrument would require knowing both the VSF \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) over the range\n0 < \xcf\x88 \xe2\x89\xa4 \xcf\x88 FOV , and the single scattering albedo \xcf\x89o ( \xce\xbb ) =\n\nb (\xce\xbb)\nc (\xce\xbb)\n\n(Vol. I, Ch. 2, Sect. 2.4). To date, very few reliable\n\nmeasurements have been made of \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) at angles less than 1\xc2\xb0. Given the extreme rate of increase in the\nmagnitude of the VSF for particles \xce\xb2p ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) , and for turbulence, as \xcf\x88 \xe2\x86\x92 0 (Ch. 1, Fig. 1.3), any estimate of its\nintegrated value over the range 0 < \xcf\x88 \xe2\x89\xa4 1\xc2\xb0 would be highly uncertain. That uncertainty would transmit directly into\nany c ( \xce\xbb ) correction algorithm attempting to account for the effects of the near-forward VSF.\n\n19\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nThe best approach to dealing with the effects of scattered light in measured beam attenuation coefficients may\nbe that proposed by both Voss and Austin (1993) and Pegau et al. (1995). That is, do not try to apply any scattering\ncorrections to the measured determination of c ( \xce\xbb ) . Simply report the acceptance angle characteristics of the\ntransmissometer used to make the measurements, and leave all considerations of how to handle scattering artifacts to\nthe user of the data. Internal consistency of IOP is obtained by including light scattered up to a certain acceptance\nangle \xcf\x88 FOV in the beam attenuation coefficient, and not including it in the VSF. We may rerwrite (1.1),\nc ( \xce\xbb ) = a ( \xce\xbb ) + b ( \xce\xbb ) , as\n\n\xcf\x88 FOV\n\n\xcf\x88 FOV\n\nc ( \xce\xbb ) = a ( \xce\xbb ) + 2\xcf\x80\n\n\xcf\x80\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) sin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88 + 2\xcf\x80 \xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) sin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88 ,\n\nor,\ncm ( \xce\xbb ) = c ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 2\xcf\x80\n\n\xcf\x88 FOV\n\n\xe2\x88\xab\n\n\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) sin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88 = a ( \xce\xbb ) + 2\xcf\x80\n\n\xcf\x80\n\n\xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) sin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88 = a ( \xce\xbb ) + b ( \xce\xbb )\nm\n\n\xcf\x88 FOV\n\n0\n\nwhere cm ( \xce\xbb ) and bm ( \xce\xbb ) are the measured beam attenuation and volume scattering coefficients, respectively.\nIn another design variant, the beam is cylindrically limited, rather than collimated. In the cylindrically limited\nlight arrangement, the pinhole at the source is imaged on the receiver lens, and the receiver aperture is focused on\nthe source lens. This design illuminates a large volume of water and uses more of the source light. No currently\navailable commercial instruments use the cylindrically limited design, although at one point in history,\ntransmissometers of this type were manufactured by Martek. The Visibility Laboratory Spectral Transmissometer\n(VLST) was a laboratory-built instrument using a cylindrically limited beam in a folded path configuration (Petzold\nand Austin 1968). Several copies of the VLST, built in the late 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, continued in use to measure c ( \xce\xbb ) until\ncirca 1990.\nPathlength Considerations\nOne issue that must be addressed when designing a transmissometer is what the in-water pathlength should be.\nScientifically, it is important to keep the pathlength long enough that the sample volume presents a statistical\naverage of the surrounding water, and short enough that multiply scattered light is not incorporated into the beam.\nIn most ocean waters, multiply scattered light is not in general a problem for the commercially available\ntransmissometers. If scattered light leaves the beam then it will take two additional scattering events to get the light\nback into the beam and redirected towards the detector. The addition of baffles along the light path can nearly\neliminate any possibility of multiply scattered light being detected in ordinary circumstance. In extremely turbid\nwaters, however, the single scattering albedo is very large, and the volume scattering phase function \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95 ) is\nextremely biased in the near forward direction (Fig. 1.3, Ch. 1). Under such conditions, if rT > 3c ( \xce\xbb )\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\nm , there is\n\na significant probability that some fraction of scattered photons will undergo 3 or more successive small angle\nscattering events, re-enter the transmission path, and join the flux reaching the detector. The apparent beam\nattenuation coefficient will be artificially reduced if this occurs.\nThere are also engineering concerns associated with the optical pathlength. The path must be short enough that\nlight reaches the detector; it would do no good to have an instrument with a pathlength rT \xe2\x89\x88 10c ( \xce\xbb )\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\nm , because\n\nthe transmitted signal would not be detectable. On the other hand, the pathlength must be long enough for\nattenuation to reduce the transmitted flux enough that the difference in incident and transmitted fluxes are large\nenough to be measurable. Longer pathlengths also reduce the relative uncertainty in the measurement of the\npathlength rT .\nA pathlength in the range c ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x89\xa4 rT \xe2\x89\xa4 3c ( \xce\xbb )\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\nis generally considered close to optimal. As electronics and\n\nsources have improved, however, instruments with pathlengths rT < c ( \xce\xbb )\nwide range of oceanic conditions.\n\n20\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\nm have been shown to work well over a\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nAmbient Light Rejection in Open and Enclosed Path Transmissometers\nThe basic transmissometer designs (Fig. 2.1) do not physically reject all ambient sunlight, which could add to\nthe measured flux. Enclosed path designs that place the optical path within a cell through which the water is\npumped, such as the ac-9, have more physical blocking of ambient light, but are not totally immune to its effects.\nSome scheme must be developed to remove ambient light artifacts. A simple approach is to measure the signal with\nthe source on and with the source off. The ambient signal with the source off is used as the dark reference for\nrelating output signal to transmitted flux. The current generation of instruments use a more sophisticated, but\nsimilar, approach. The light source is rapidly modulated (chopped) and the detector output is phase locked to the\nmodulation frequency, so that the transmitted flux is proportional to the amplitude of the alternating component of\ndetector output. The key underlying assumption is that the natural light field varies slowly and is not part of the\nalternating signal. This approach may have difficulties when the ambient light also varies rapidly, such as with\nindoor lights that have a 60 Hz fluctuation, or near the ocean surface where waves may rapidly modulate the light\nfield. Even with good electronic rejection of ambient light, it is wise to reduce the possible influence of ambient\nlight by using baffles and careful positioning of the instrument.\n\n2.3 CHARACTERIZATION and CALIBRATION OF BEAM\nTRANSMISSOMETERS\nCalibration With Pure Water\nAs explained above, the calibration constant CT for a transmissometer is determined by measuring its response\nto a \xe2\x80\x9cstandard\xe2\x80\x9d medium having a known value of cSTD ( \xce\xbb ) . The optical \xe2\x80\x9cstandard\xe2\x80\x9d medium commonly used to\ncalibrate oceanographic transmissometers and absorption meters (Ch. 3) is pure water, so that\ncSTD ( \xce\xbb ) = cw ( \xce\xbb ) = aw ( \xce\xbb ) + bw ( \xce\xbb ) . The recommended values of aw ( \xce\xbb ) and bw ( \xce\xbb ) are taken from Table 1.2, as\nexplained in Ch. 1, Sect. 1.2.\nPure water of optical calibration grade is freshly prepared by methods described in Chapter 3. This difficult\nstep is critical, because residual traces of particles and/or dissolved organic material introduce serious calibration\noffsets and relative uncertainties between calibrations. The pure water standard is introduced into the optical path\nby one of two methods:\n1.\n\nAn open path transmissometer must be thoroughly cleaned and rinsed in purified water, and then\nimmersed in a test tank containing the pure water standard. Care must be taken to prevent bubbles\nfrom collecting on the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s optical windows. It is ordinarily not practical to carry out this\ncalibration procedure at sea.\n\n2.\n\nTo calibrate an enclosed path instrument, a volume of the pure water standard is pumped through the\nflow-through measurement cell, as described in detail in Chapter 3 for the ac-9, as an example.\nProcedures to assure bubbles do not form within, or be introduced into, the flow-through measurement\ncell (Ch. 3) must be followed carefully. This pure-water calibration procedure can be carried out at\nsea, and it is recommended to do so daily, whenever possible.\n\nIn either case, after allowing suitable time for the instrument to warm up, the instrument signal outputs in\ndark\nresponse to flux transmitted in the pure water standard and dark (ambient) background, VD,w ( \xce\xbb ) and VD,w ( \xce\xbb ) [and\ndark\nif appropriate, also VR,w ( \xce\xbb ) and VR,w ( \xce\xbb ) ], are recorded over a several minute sampling period and averaged.\n\nFor pure water, the forward scattering is sufficiently small that the acceptance angle has little effect on the\ncalibration. From equation (1.7) (Ch. 1), the transmittance of the pure water standard is Tw ( \xce\xbb, rT ) = e \xe2\x88\x92 cw ( \xce\xbb ) rT .

The total beam attenuation coefficient c ( \xce\xbb ) may be easily determined by adding cw ( \xce\xbb )\n\nfrom Table 1.1 (Ch. 1) to the difference calculated with equation (2.9) or (2.10).\nAn alternative approach to determining the total beam attenuation coefficient directly from the measured\nvoltage response is to determine, from the pure water calibration, a calculated offset reference voltage Vref ( \xce\xbb ) and\ndark offset Vdark ( \xce\xbb ) such that the total transmittance may be calculated directly as\ndark\n\xef\xa3\xaeVD ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 VD,w ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n\xef\xa3\xbb ,\nT ( \xce\xbb, rT ) = \xef\xa3\xb0\n(2.11)\ndark\n\xef\xa3\xaeVref ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 VD,w ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\ndark\ndark\nwhere it is assumed that VD ( \xce\xbb ) = VD,w ( \xce\xbb ) varies very slowly over time and may be treated as an instrument\n\nconstant.

These values are typically reported with the calibration records, as \xe2\x80\x9cfactory\xe2\x80\x9d\nair calibration and dark values (and thus the superscript \xe2\x80\x9cf\xe2\x80\x9d), to allow the user to periodically record \xe2\x80\x9cair\ncalibration\xe2\x80\x9d, or \xe2\x80\x9cair tracking\xe2\x80\x9d data as a check on instrument stability. Air tracking is primarily intended to be used\nto monitor offsets in the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s output due to changes in the optical system caused by shipping or mounting of\nthe instrument to a cage or other deployment package. Air tracking can also be used to monitor instrument drift over\nextended periods of time. Historically, before the advent of pure water field calibrations, the air calibration was the\nonly stability tracking method available.\nAir tracking data is best obtained in the laboratory, where the environment is consistently clean and dry,\npreferably before and after each transmissometer deployment. Although air calibrations can be performed while in\nthe field, it is at best, difficult to do them on a ship due to the moist environment. Readings in air may be\nsignificantly offset by small amounts of moisture either condensed on, or adsorbed in the windows.\nDetailed protocols for carrying out air calibrations are provided for particular instruments by the manufacturer.\nIn general terms, the protocols include instructions and methods for careful cleaning of optical surfaces, allowing\ntime for exposed optical surfaces to dehydrate in a dry environment, and procedures to avoid or compensate for\ntemperature increases when the instrument is operated in air.\nUser air calibration values can be used to adjust the pure water calibration and responses to correct for\ninstrument drift as\nadjusted\n=\nVD,w\n\ndark\nVD,air \xe2\x88\x92 VD,air\n\nf\ndark,f\n\xef\xa3\xaeVD,w \xe2\x88\x92 VD,w \xef\xa3\xb9 ,\nf\ndark,f\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nVD,air \xe2\x88\x92 VD,air \xef\xa3\xb0\n\n(2.13)\n\nand the adjusted pure water-response and dark values are substituted into (2.10) to calibrate field measurements. If\nthe manufacturer instead provides a factory reference voltage for calibrating the instrument using equation (2.11),\nadjusted\nthe adjusted pure water and dark values should be substituted in (2.12) to determine Vref\n. Air calibration\nadjustments of this type are usually recommended only for instruments with \xe2\x80\x9cconstant\xe2\x80\x9d LED source output, such as\nthe WET Labs C-Star, older SeaTech red transmissometers, and other similar instruments by different\nmanufacturers. Field water calibrations are the recommended basis for correcting drifts in closed path, flow-through\ncell instrument, such as the ac-9.\nInstrument Temperature Dependence\nThe change in a transmissometer\xe2\x80\x99s response and dark values are usually determined by measuring response\nvariations, with the optical path in air, or in a dry, inert gas such as Nitrogen or Argon, as the instrument temperature\nis varied. The response and dark values at each internal instrument temperature (an ancillary measurement and data\noutput needed for temperature corrections) are recorded, and reported either as a lookup table of correction factor\nand temperature pairs, or as the coefficients of a polynomial function of temperature that has been fit to the\ncorrection factors. Instruments that have a closed, flow-through optical cell are usually characterized in a water\nbath, the temperature of which is cycled over a range typically from 5 oC to 30 oC over the course of the experiment;\nto avoid condensation, the flow-through cell is usually filled with a dry, inert gas and sealed. The internal\ninstrument temperatures are somewhat higher than the ambient temperature, due to heating by the electronic circuits\nand source. If this experiment is done with air in the optical path of an open-path transmissometer, i.e. in a\ntemperature controlled chamber, some method must be used and documented to avoid artifacts due to condensation\non the windows.\n\n2.4 FIELD MEASUREMENT METHODS\nThe procedures for measuring in situ profiles, over depth z, of c ( z , \xce\xbb ) using constant output LED source\ntransmissometers are straightforward. The instrument is connected into a data acquisition system and mounted on a\nprofiling cage following the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. If the instrument has an analog output, the user must\n\n23\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nensure that the external analog-to-digital converter used to digitize the readings is calibrated in absolute units of V,\nsince that is the basis on which the instrument has been calibrated.\nThe windows on the beam transmissometer must be cleaned with lens cleaner, or a mild detergent solution, and\na soft cloth, or tissue, rinsed with distilled water, then rinsed with isopropyl alcohol and wiped dry. An approximate\nair calibration reading should be made before every cast to verify that the windows are clean. A transmissometer\ndark voltage should also be measured at this time. These on-deck air calibrations should be logged and compared to\nthe more careful air calibrations done under dry laboratory conditions before and after each cruise (Section 2.3). If\npre- and post-cruise air calibrations are significantly different, the time history should indicate whether the change\noccurred suddenly (e.g. a scratch in the window), or as a drift over time.\nEach time an open-path transmissometer is placed into the water, care must be taken to assure that bubbles do\nnot collect on the windows, particularly if the instrument is mounted in a vertical orientation.\nProtocols covering methods for making field measurements with the ac-9 instrument are described in detail in\nZee et al. (2002). Some critical aspects of these protocols are briefly reviewed in Chapter 3 to emphasize their\nimportance.\n\n2.5 DATA ANALYSIS METHODS\nThere are several generic steps needed to process and analyze a vertical profile of measured transmissometer\ndata:\n1.\n\nMerge the transmissometer data with externally measured depth and temperature data. Assuming that the\ntransmissometer does not have an internal, high-quality depth transducer, it is usually mounted together\nwith a CTD to provide the depth and water temperature fields. If the transmissometer output data record\ndoes not include the internal instrument temperature measured by a built-in thermistor, external water\ntemperature provides the basis for any temperature compensation adjustments that may be required.\n\n2.\n\nApply lag corrections to account for the time interval between when water enters the intake port and when\nit enters the beam-attenuation measurement optical path in a flow-through transmissometer.\n\n3.\n\nSubtract the depth offset between the pressure transducer used to measure package depth and either\n\na.\n\nthe intake port of a flow-through transmissometer, or\n\nb.\n\nthe midpoint of the optical path in an open path transmissometer.\n\n4.\n\nField calibration adjustments should be applied by the methods specified by the manufacturer of a\nparticular instrument. In many cases this will involve entering the changes in an instrument calibration file\nused by the computer software that implements and applies (2.9) or (2.10) to calibrate the data.\na.\n\nPure water calibration results are the preferred source of these adjustments for flow-through\ninstruments.\n\nb.\n\nAir calibration for tracking drift corrections should be applied using only data from calibrations\ncarried out under dry laboratory conditions and showing insignificant variations between replicated\ncalibrations. When the manufacturer represents the calibration coefficients in terms of a reference\nsignal to be applied using (2.11), the corrected air calibration factor is computed using (2.13).\n\n5.\n\nInstrument Internal Temperature Compensation factors should be applied in the manner specified by the\nmanufacturer of a particular instrument.\n\n6.\n\nCompute transmittances T ( \xce\xbb, rT ) , and beam attenuation coefficients c ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 cw ( \xce\xbb ) offsets, relative to\npure water using the appropriate combination of equations (2.9), (2.10), or (2.11) with (1.6) for the\ninstrument type and output data.\n\n7.\n\nAdd pure water cw ( \xce\xbb ) , determined from Table 1.1, to c ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 cw ( \xce\xbb ) to obtain the total beam attenuation\ncoefficient c ( \xce\xbb ) .\n\n24\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nDetailed procedures required to carry out each of the above steps for particular instrument are typically provided by\nthe manufacturer. WET Labs Inc., for example, provides both a User\xe2\x80\x99s Manual for it\xe2\x80\x99s ac-9 absorption and beam\nattenuation coefficient meter, and a detailed ac-9 Protocol Manual (Van Zee et al. 2002); additional information\nfrom the latter document, regarding absorption and beam attenuation measurements, is outlined in Chapter 3.\nMany of the steps listed above apply also when a transmissometer is installed and operated on a ship as a\ncomponent of an along-track measurement system. The lengthy plumbing path in such a system introduces\nintake-to-measurement lags of up to several minutes, while a research vessel typically advances approximately one\nKm in 3 min. Therefore, accurate temporal and spatial co-registration of, e.g., surface water temperature,\nchlorophyll a fluorescence, and c ( \xce\xbb ) requires accurate determination of the flow rate and lag time between a water\nvolume\xe2\x80\x99s intake (usually in a ship\xe2\x80\x99s sea chest), passage through some debubbler apparatus, and its arrival in the\nmeasurement cell of each instrument.\n\nREFERENCES\nBarth, H., K.

Chapter 4 of this Volume is devoted to laboratory spectrophotometric methods\nof measuring absorption of particles and dissolved materials in filtered water samples. The present chapter focuses\non commercially available instruments11 that may be used from ships and moored platforms to practically measure\na ( \xce\xbb ) in support of satellite validation activities. This first version of absorption protocols is particularly focused on\ninstruments that fall under the \xe2\x80\x9creflective tube\xe2\x80\x9d design concept briefly introduced in Sect. 1.4. However, the\nconceptual basis for determining absorption by measuring flux reflected from a diffuse target is also described later\nin this section. Expanded reviews of protocols using instruments based on other design concepts are deferred for\npossible consideration in future revisions to this volume.\nReflective Tube Absorption Meter Concepts\nIn Sect. 1.4 it was observed that to determine the absorption coefficient associated with transmission over an\noptical pathlength rT (Fig. 1.4), it would be necessary to measure the sum of transmitted and scattered flux at the\n\ndetector, \xce\xa6 K ( rT ) = \xce\xa6 T ( rT ) + \xce\xa6 B ( rT ) . Neglecting backscattering, it was suggested that perhaps one might redirect\n\nall forward scattered flux to the detector using an ideal reflective tube, and determine the absorption coefficient as\na=\n\n\xe2\x88\x921 \xef\xa3\xab \xce\xa6 T ( rT ) + \xce\xa6 B ( rT ) \xef\xa3\xb6\nln \xef\xa3\xac\n\xef\xa3\xb7.\n\xef\xa3\xb7\n\xce\xa6o ( 0)\nrT \xef\xa3\xac\n\xef\xa3\xad\n\xef\xa3\xb8\n\n(3.1)\n\nOf course a perfectly reflecting tube cannot be realized in a real instrument. Nevertheless, because the scattering\nphase function of suspended particles in natural waters is strongly peaked in the forward direction (Fig. 1.3), it is\npossible to use this approach to retain more than approximately 85% of scattered photons in the beam reaching the\ndetector of such an instrument. James and Birge (1938) built a laboratory version of such an instrument to measure\nabsorption spectra of lake waters, and Zaneveld et al. (1992) introduced an instrument of this type for in situ\nabsorption measurements. In essence, such an instrument is simply a poor transmissometer (Chapter 2) that fails to\nexclude all of the singly scattered photons from its beam transmittance measurement, and therefore, in its ideal\nrealization would measure only losses due by absorption as per equations (1.9) and (1.10).\nThe transmittance, absorption, scattering and reflection interaction processes that occur in a real reflective tube\nabsorption meter are illustrated schematically in Fig. 3.1. A source emits collimated flux with a cross sectional area\nslightly less that that of the reflective tube, and flux reaching the other end of the tube is measured by a detector that\ncovers its entire cross-sectional area. Ray paths extending directly from the source to the detector indicate direct\ntransmittance of flux. Ray paths that terminate within the water volume enclosed by the tube indicate absorbed flux.\n11\n\nCertain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this chapter to foster understanding.\nSuch identification does not imply recommendation, or endorsement, by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the\npurpose.\n27\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nIn natural waters a large fraction of scattered photons are only slightly deflected in the near forward direction (Fig.\n1.3) and proceed directly to the large-area detector without encountering the tube walls. Ray paths with scattering\nangles large enough to encounter the water-quartz interface, where refraction and reflection take place; the refracted\nportion is transmitted to the outer quartz-air interface, where another refraction and reflection interaction occurs.\nFor simplicity in this conceptual discussion, we do not consider multiple reflection and refractive transmittance\ninteractions within the thin quartz layer. Ray paths containing a scattering angle less than the critical angle \xcf\x88 c\nassociated with total internal reflection at the outer quartz-air interface, are totally reflected on each encounter with\nthe tube wall and are transmitted to the detector over a slightly elongated path; for a quartz reflective tube,\n\xcf\x88 c \xe2\x89\x85 42\xc2\xb0 , and thus the total internal reflectance represents a very large fraction of all flux scattered by particles\n\xcf\x80\nundergoes partial\n2\ntransmittance losses [1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x81g ( \xcf\x88 )] at each encounter with the reflectance tube, with the reflected portion continuing\n\n(Fig. 1.3). Flux transmitted along ray paths with a scattering angle in the range \xcf\x88 c < \xcf\x88 <\n\nover a zig-zag path until either reaching the detector or disappearing due to attenuation by absorption and\ntransmission losses in multiple encounters with the tube wall. Flux along ray paths containing a scattering angle\n\xcf\x80\n\xcf\x88 \xe2\x89\xa5 , i.e. backscattered flux, is lost from the forward transmittance altogether. Backscattering accounts for only a\n2\nfew percent of scattering by marine particulates (Fig. 1.3).\n\nFigure 3.1: Schematic illustration of light interactions and transmission in a reflective tube absorption\nmeter. Ray paths ending in the water represent absorption, and those extending directly from the\nsource to detector represent beam transmittance. Other ray paths indicate scattering interactions: 1)\nbackward scattered paths do not reach the detector, 2) paths with forward scattering at an angle less\nthan the critical angle, i.e. \xcf\x88 \xe2\x89\xa4 \xcf\x88 c , experience total internal reflection by the tube and reach the\ndetector over an elongated optical path, and 3) forward scattered ray paths at angles in the range\n\xcf\x80\n\xcf\x88 c < \xcf\x88 < experience partial losses from the tube at the quartz-air interface, and may or may not\n2\nreach the detector depending on whether the internally reflected path survives the absorption process.\nIn the single scattering approximation, the flux measured by the detector of a reflective tube absorption meter\nmay be written\nrT \xcf\x88 c\n\n\xce\xa6 m ( rT ) = \xce\xa6 T ( rT ) + 2\xcf\x80\xce\xa6 o ( 0 ) \xe2\x88\xab \xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb2 ( \xcf\x88 )e e\n\xe2\x88\x92 cr\n\n\xe2\x88\x92a\n\nrT \xe2\x88\x92 r\ncos \xcf\x88\n\n\xe2\x88\x92a\n\nrT \xe2\x88\x92 r\ncos \xcf\x88\n\nsin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88dr +\n\n0 0\n\nrT \xcf\x88 c\n\n2\xcf\x80\xce\xa6 o ( 0 ) \xe2\x88\xab \xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb2 ( \xcf\x88 )e \xe2\x88\x92 cr e\n0 0\n\n,\n\xef\xa3\xae\xcf\x81 g ( \xcf\x88 ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\nN ( rT \xe2\x88\x92 r )\n\n(3.2)\n\nsin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88dr\n\nwhere \xcf\x81g ( \xcf\x88 ) is net reflectance of the quartz tube beyond the critical angle, and the exponent N (rT \xe2\x88\x92 r ; \xcf\x88) is the\naverage number of wall reflections required for a ray path to reach the detector following a scattering event at\n\n28\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\ndistance r and angle \xcf\x88 .

In other words, the weighting coefficient\nW ( \xcf\x88 ) may be interpreted as the fraction of light that is scattered at angle \xcf\x88 that does not reach the absorption\ndetector; it may take values from 0, indicating all light scattered at that angle reaches the detector, to 1, indicating\nthat none of the light reaches the detector. The uncertainty of absorption coefficients determined from\nmeasurements with a reflective tube instrument is largely determined by the uncertainty of the methods used to\ncorrect for the integrated scattering error (Zaneveld et al. 1994), which will be briefly summarized below in Sect.\n3.4. The remaining sections of this chapter summarize protocols related to characterization, measurement and data\nanalysis using the ac-9 reflective tube absorption meter.\nDetermination of Absorption by Measuring Flux Reflected from a Diffuse Reflectance Surface\nFigure 3.2 illustrates an alternative proposed instrument concept for use in combination with a backscattering\nmeter (Chapter 5) to determine a ( \xce\xbb ) in situ. A divergent source illuminates a diffusely reflecting target oriented\nparallel to the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s window at a fixed distance d\xcf\x81 . An instrument of this type, called the \xe2\x80\x9c\xce\xb1-\xce\xb2eta\xe2\x80\x9d, is\ncommercially available through HOBILABS, Inc.\n\nFigure 3.2: Conceptual schematic illustration of an instrument designed to determine the\nvolume absorption coefficient by measuring diffuse reflectance from a plaque. The VSF at\none or more angles must be independently and concurrently measured in this approach.\nSee also Figure 5.1, and the related discussion of calibrating a VSF meter using a diffuse\nreflecting plaque in Section 5.3, in Chapter 5 of this Volume.\n\n29\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nFor simplicity in this conceptual discussion, we will assume: 1) that the source beam and detector FOV\ngeometries are identical, 2) that the central viewing angles of each are equal, i.e. \xce\xb8o = \xce\xb8d (Fig. 3.2), and 3) that the\n\xcf\x81\n. The flux reaching the plaque\n\xcf\x80\nfrom the source, including flux scattered in the near forward direction (up to ~15o or so) as well as direct\ntransmission, may be expressed as\n\nplaque\xe2\x80\x99s Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is a constant\n\n\xce\xa6 r = k o \xce\xa6 o exp \xef\xa3\xae \xe2\x88\x92(a + bo )z \xef\xa3\xb9 ,\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere ko is a constant representing the optical characteristics (reflection and transmission losses, effective detector\narea, etc.) of the source, z is the mean effective pathlength for flux transmitted from the source window to the\n\xcf\x88f\n\nplaque, bo = b \xe2\x88\x92 2\xcf\x80 \xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb2 ( \xcf\x88 ) sin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88 is flux scattered beyond a forward scattering angle \xcf\x88 f < 15\xc2\xb0 comparable to the\n0\n\nbeam geometric width. For typical particle phase functions, a very large fraction of singly scattered flux is confined\nwithin the forward 15o cone. By similar reasoning, the flux reflected diffusely from the plaque and reaching the\ndetector may be written as\n\xce\xa6d = kd\n\n\xcf\x81\n\xcf\x81\n\xce\xa6 r exp \xef\xa3\xae \xe2\x88\x92(a + bd )z \xef\xa3\xb9 = k d k o \xce\xa6 o exp \xef\xa3\xae \xe2\x88\x92(2a + bo + bd )z \xef\xa3\xb9 ,\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\xcf\x80\n\xcf\x80\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere kd is a constant accounting for the optical characteristics of the detector assembly, and bd represents\nscattering losses at angles too large to be detected in a single scattering approximation, i.e. the counterpart for bo for\na diffuse source and the detector FOV. Equation (3.5) assumes further that the flux backscattered from the\nintersection volume of the source beam and detector FOV, the shaded conical region in Fig. 3.2, is negligibly small\ncompared to the flux reflected from the plaque. At this point it may be appropriate for the reader to compare the\nsimilarities between the instrument concept illustrated Fig. 2.2 (Chapter 2) and the calibration geometry for\ndetermining the weighting function of a VSF, as illustrated in Fig. 5.1, and as described for a plaque reflectance\nmeasurement geometry at a fixed distance z as part of the VSF calibration described in Sect. 5.2 (Chapter 5 of this\nvolume) and in Maffione and Dana (1997).\nFollowing the approach used to determine the backscattering coefficient from a measurement \xce\xb2 ( \xcf\x88\xe2\x88\x97 ) of the\nVSF at a single angle \xcf\x88\xe2\x88\x97 in the backward direction (Chapter 5, Sect. 5.4), Dana, Maffione and Coenen (HOBILabs,\nInc., personal comm., circa 2000) originally assumed that\nbo + bd \xe2\x89\x85 \xcf\x87\xce\xb2 ( \xcf\x88 \xe2\x88\x97 ) ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere \xcf\x87 is an unknown constant. The \xe2\x80\x9c\xce\xb1-\xce\xb2eta\xe2\x80\x9d instrument designed and manufactured by HOBILabs combines a\nVSF meter (Chapter 5) to measure \xce\xb2 (140\xc2\xb0 ) with a device conceptually similar to that illustrated in Fig. 3.2,\nmounted at opposite ends of a small cylinder.\nIf the source is regulated to emit constant flux, the system constants of the diffuse reflectance device may be\ncollected as\n\xcf\x81\nko \xce\xa6o ,\n(3.7)\n\xcf\x80\nwhere Fd is the detector assembly\xe2\x80\x99s signal responsivity to flux received at the instrument window in water, i.e.\nk = Fd k d\n\nFd =\n\nVd \xe2\x88\x92 Vddark\n.

These considerations must be deferred to a possible future revision to this protocol\nvolume.\n\n3.2 CHARACTERIZATION and CALIBRATION OF REFLECTIVE TUBE\nSPECTRAL ABSORPTION METERS\nPerhaps the best-known version of a reflective tube absorption meter is the ac-9 manufactured by WET Labs,\nInc. This instrument measures both the spectral beam attenuation coefficient c ( \xce\xbb ) in an enclosed flow-through\nnon-reflective optical path, and the spectral volume absorption coefficient a ( \xce\xbb ) using parallel enclosed flowthrough reflective tube optical paths, one of which (the absorption side) is a reflective tube (Fig. 3.1). Many aspects\nof the characterization, calibration, field measurements and data analysis protocols relating to this type of instrument\nwere introduced in Chapter 2 and will not be repeated here. Moreover the manufacturer provides extremely detailed\n\n31\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nprotocols for calibrating and using this instrument, and for analyzing its data, both in the ac-9 User Manual, and in a\ndetailed protocol manual (Van Zee et al. 2002), both of which are available online (www.wetlabs.com). Additional\nbackground information related to characterization, calibration and data analysis methods for this instrument may be\nfound in Moore et al. (1992), Zaneveld et al. (1992) and Twardowski et al. (1999). Here we will briefly highlight\ncritical aspects of the protocols that must be carefully followed to obtain accurate a ( \xce\xbb ) measurements using this, or\na similar, instrument in the field. Many of these topics, as they relate to the beam transmissometer side of the\ninstrument, have been discussed in Chapter 2 of this volume.\n\nFig. 3.3 Schematic illustration of the ac-9 beam attenuation and absorption meter\n(courtesy of WET Labs , Inc).\n\nPure Water Calibration\nThe procedure for using pure water to calibrate the reflective tube absorption meter side of an ac-9 is identical\nto that described in Chapter 2 (Sect. 2.4) for its flow-through beam-transmissometer side.

After primary de-ionization, the water is processed using a Barnstead, or equivalent, purification\nunit and stored in a large holding tank. To maintain purity, water in the holding tank should be re-circulated through\na ultra-violet chamber and additional purification filters. Water for calibration is drawn through a 0.01-micron ultrafilter at the point of delivery. The circulating holding tank allows the highly reactive de-ionized water to equilibrate\nwith the ambient conditions and the ultra-violet chamber prevents any biological contamination from entering the\nreservoir.\nFor field calibrations, one approach is to either purchase HPLC grade pure water, or produce it in the lab, and\ntransport it to the ship, especially for short cruises. On some research vessels, a water deionization and purification\nsystem is permanently installed to support the scientific party. If so, care must be taken to insure that the filters are\nfresh and do not produce Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) from decaying particles trapped in the filter.\nAlternatively, a portable system consisting of a commercial filtration unit, such as the Barnstead E-Pure or the MilliQ Q-Pak treatment systems may be set up temporarily on the ship. The input water should be pre-filtered using a\n1.5 \xc2\xb5m commercial filter cartridge and an activated charcoal filter to increase the lifetime of the primary unit. Pure\nwater should be produced in advance of the calibration and stored in a clean 20-liter polycarbonate carboy and be\nallowed to stand for approximately 12 hours to equilibrate with the ambient temperature and to remove bubbles.\nTo calibrate an ac-9, the carboy may be equipped with a cap having barb fittings to connect tubing to a\npressurization unit that pushes water to the instrument (Fig. 3.4). The carboy is pressurized to approximately 10 psi\nusing an oil free air pump, or a tank of dry nitrogen gas. The air supply tube inside the carboy should be kept above\nthe water level to prevent the creation of bubbles when pressurizing the carboy, and the outlet tube should extend\nnearly to the bottom of the carboy. To connect the carboy to the ac-9, Teflon tubing is recommended, rather than\nTygon tubing, which may contain plasticizers that can contaminate the water. The tubing from the carboy is\nconnected to the bottom nozzle on the ac-9 flow tube. The tubing near the ac-9 inlet and outlet should be covered\nwith black tape to avoid ambient light leaks into the optical path. A short piece of tubing with a valve is connected to\nthe top nozzle on the flow tube, both to control water flow through the system, and to provide backpressure, which\nhelps to keep gases in solution and prevents the formation of micro-bubbles. An optional 0.2-micron filter may be\nplaced at the point of delivery.\n\nFig. 3.4. Schematic illustration of a pure-water supply system for field\ncalibrations of an ac-9.\n\nAir \xe2\x80\x9cCalibrations\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis procedure is discussed adequately in Chapter 2.\n\n33\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\n3.3 MEASURING SPECTRAL ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS WITH\nREFLECTIVE TUBE METERS\nThe ac-9 should be mounted in a profiling instrument cage following directions provided by the manufacturer\n(Van Zee et al. 2002). It is strongly recommended to mount a CTD data the same profiling package as an ac-9, and\nto develop a method for accurately merging the measurements from both instruments; combining the data streams\nfrom the two instruments in real time as part of the data acquisition system is the preferred approach, with a second\nchoice being to time-tag both data records and merge the data on that basis. The basis of these recommendations is\nthat water temperature and salinity data are essential for the corrections described below in Sect. 3.4.\nTo begin a cast, place the instrument package in the water before they are powered up. Then hold the package\nunderwater near the surface allow approximately 5 min for the instruments to warm up, stabilize the electronics, and\nreduce the possibility that thermal shock may adversely affect the measurements. Monitor the instrument outputs\nand wait to begin profiling until the instrument stabilizes at the surface. If an absorption meter will not stabilize its\nreadings after 5-10 minutes under these conditions, it is recommended that it be returned to the manufacturer for\ncharacterization of the problem and necessary repairs.\nIf possible place the instrument 10 to 20 meters below the surface to help purge bubbles. Purging bubbles is\nmore difficult when making filtered measurements (see below). If you are not making filtered measurements the\ninstruments will generally purge at the surface, but purging them below 10 m is still a good idea.\nThe reader is referred to Van Zee et al. (2002) for detailed recommendations concerning rates of descent during\nprofiles using an ac-9.\nAfter the instruments are brought on deck following a cast, they should be immediately rinsed, and the flow\ntubes flushed, with fresh water to mitigate corrosion. If the instrument will be on deck for more than 30 min\nbetween casts, the optics and flow tubes should be cleaned with Nannopure water and dried. At least once per day,\nwhile at sea, the optics and flow tubes should be cleaned with methanol, cleaned again using a mild detergent\ndissolved in Nannopure water, rinsed with Nannopure water, cleaned again with methanol, and finally dried. Use\nsoft tissues, such as KimWipes, to gently clean and dry the optical surface, and be extremely careful to wipe them in\na constant direction and to not scrub the optical surfaces.\nWhen the instrument package is be stored on deck for a prolonged period between casts, cover it with a\ntarpaulin to protect the absorption meter from direct exposure to the sun. Excessive solar heating of the instrument\no\no\nmay exceed the practical limits (5 C to 30 C) of internal temperature corrections for an ac-9, and thus invalidate its\nmeasurements until it has cooled sufficiently to restore normal operations.\nFiltering the Water Intake Port of an ac-9 for Measurements of Absorption by CDOM and Particles\nThe absorption coefficient of dissolved material may be measured by attaching a 0.2 \xc2\xb5m pore-size filter to the\nintake of an ac-9. The recommended practice is to locate the intake filter below the instrument at the bottom of the\ncage. Measurements in the filtered intake configuration are also very useful for testing the operational performance\nof ac-9; quality control procedures using dissolved measurements are discussed in Sect. 3.5.\nExamples of suitable filters are the Gelman Suporcap 100 and Gelman Maxi-cap (0.2 \xc2\xb5m) filters. These filters\nhave high flow rates at low differential pressure and don\xe2\x80\x99t adsorb or leach materials. The outer housings of these\ncommercial filter cartridges may be cut off to allow some flushing of the filter and increase the flow-rate. Make\nsure you don\xe2\x80\x99t handle the filter material, or lay a filter on the deck, where it can be exposed to oil and grease. Hose\nclamp the filter to the tubing and make sure any vents on the filter are closed. Before use, a filter should be either\nflushed for several minutes with DI water, or soaked several hours in DI water, to remove air pockets in the filter\nmembrane. As a note of caution, never flush a filter in the reverse direction!\nThere are alternative ways to plumb the filters into the ac-9 instrument. The preferred arrangement is to filter\nthe a and c sides separately using two filters and two pumps, so that each side is plumbed independently. This\napproach is expensive, however, and is not necessary for measuring the absorption by the dissolved component. For\nmeasurement of the absorption by dissolved materials, only one side needs to be filtered, because scattering by\nparticles less than 0.2 \xc2\xb5m in size is not detectable by an ac-9, and hence the filtered a and c measurements are equal.\nOn the other hand, measurements with filters on intakes of both sides are useful for quality control tests (Sect. 3.5).\n\n34\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nIf possible replace the filter daily. If you choose to replace a filter less frequently, soak it in DI water during\nlong breaks between profile measurements during a deployment. Record the date of each filter change in the cruise\nlog.\nMixing of water within the filter cartridge will smear measurements of a vertical gradient in the absorption by\ndissolved materials, and an unfiltered instrument will detect a gradient in total absorption with better vertical\nresolution. In addition, the reduced flow rate through the filter will increase the time lag to approximately 4 to 6 sec,\ncompared to 1.2 to 1.8 sec for unfiltered measurements. Moreover, the lag rate will gradually increase as a filter\naccumulates particles during its use. The preferred means of determining flow rate and lag corrections is to attach a\nflow-meter in-line into the supply or exhaust tubing. An indirect technique for estimating flow-rate related lag times\nis to match depths of changes in the a(715) channel with depths of strong changes in water temperature; these\nchanges are linked because absorption by water is temperature dependent in the near infrared (Sect. 3.4), and the\ntime lag between matched changes can be derived from the depth separation and the profiler\xe2\x80\x99s rate of descent.\nA combination of unfiltered and filtered ac-9 measurements can be used to derive particle absorption and\nattenuation coefficients, as well as absorption by CDOM. There are several combinations that can be used:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFrom measurements using a single ac-9 with the c side filtered and the a side unfiltered, particle absorption\ncan be obtained as ap ( \xce\xbb ) = a ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 aw ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 \xef\xa3\xae cg ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 cw ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 , where the measurements have been corrected\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nusing the methods described in 3.6 below. The subscript \xe2\x80\x9cg\xe2\x80\x9d is associated with CDOM, based on historical\nuse of the term \xe2\x80\x9cgelbstoffe\xe2\x80\x9d, or yellow-matter, as a pseudonym of CDOM.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFrom measurements with two ac-9\xe2\x80\x99s, one filtered and one unfiltered, ag ( \xce\xbb ) is derived directly from the\nfiltered measurements, after the corrections of Sect. 3.6, and ap ( \xce\xbb ) = a ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 ag ( \xce\xbb ) , where a ( \xce\xbb ) is derived\nfrom the unfiltered instrument and the pure water terms cancel. This approach may also be used with a\nsingle instrument by making successive casts, one with the filter attached and the second with the filter\nremoved.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAnother alternative approach is to make successive casts with one instrument, filtering the a intake on one\ncast, and the c intake on the other. The filtered and unfiltered measurements from the two casts are\ncombined as above.\n\nThe approach yielding the lowest instrumental uncertainty of the particulate absorption is to derive it from\nfiltered and unfiltered measurements with the same instrument on successive casts. Calibration offsets, whether\nknown or not, are identical in the filtered and unfiltered measurements on each side, and therefore, the offsets cancel\nwhen particle absorption is determined as the difference between the two measurements. On the other hand,\npotentially larger uncertainty may result from possible changes in the IOP profiles between casts, due to horizontal\nadvection and/or vertical displacement of IOP features by internal waves.\n\n3.6 DATA ANALYSIS METHODS\nThe initial steps in processing absorption measurements using an ac-9 reflective tube absorption meter are\nidentical to those presented for processing beam transmissometer measurements in Chapter 2, Sect. 2.5 [substituting\nequation (3.11) for (2.9) in Step 4). This information will not be repeated here. Two additional analysis steps are\nnecessary to obtain accurate absorption coefficients from combined ac-9, or similar instrument, measurements of\nam ( \xce\xbb ) and cm ( \xce\xbb ) : 1) corrections for water temperature and salinity induced offsets in water absorption and\nattenuation, and 2) corrections for scattering errors [equation (3.3)] in am ( \xce\xbb ) .\nTemperature and Salinity Corrections\no\n\nThe absorption of pure water is dependent on water temperature T [ C] (Pegau and Zaneveld 1993) and the\nabsorption coefficient of seawater is also dependent on its salinity S [PSU] (Pegau et al. 1997). These variations\naffect the measured coefficients of absorption am ( \xce\xbb ) and attenuation cm ( \xce\xbb ) in the following ways:\n\n35\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\n1.\n\nThe difference\n\n(T \xe2\x88\x92 Tr )\n\nbetween the water temperature T during a measurement at sea and the\n\ntemperature Tr of the pure water reference standard at the time the instrument was calibrated changes\nthe water absorption \xe2\x80\x9cbaseline\xe2\x80\x9d value aw ( \xce\xbb ) . This change affects am ( \xce\xbb ) and cm ( \xce\xbb ) equally,\nbecause scattering by pure water is not significantly temperature dependent.\n2.\n\nThe absorption of seawater varies with salinity S, and of course S = 0 PSU for the pure water\nreference standard used to calibrate the ac-9. This additional shift in the water-absorption \xe2\x80\x9cbaseline\xe2\x80\x9d\nalso affects am ( \xce\xbb ) and cm ( \xce\xbb ) equally.\n\n3.\n\nThe salinity dependent variations in the refractive index of seawater affect the transmission of the\noptical windows, and the effects are different for the windows of the absorption and beam transmission\nsides of the instrument. This effect may also vary slightly between instruments (Van Zee et al. 2002).\n\n4.\n\nTherefore, separate coefficients\n\n\xe2\x88\x82a ( \xce\xbb )\n\nand\n\n\xe2\x88\x82c ( \xce\xbb )\n\ncombine salinity dependent instrument\n\xe2\x88\x82S\n\xe2\x88\x82S\ncharacteristics and water-absorption variations (Pegau et al. 1997; Van Zee et al. 2002), and must be\napplied separately to correct to am ( \xce\xbb ) and cm ( \xce\xbb )\n\nThe temperature and salinity corrections are applied to measured absorption as\nTS\nam ( \xce\xbb ) = am ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92\n\n\xe2\x88\x82aw ( \xce\xbb )\n\xe2\x88\x82T\n\n(T \xe2\x88\x92 Tr ) \xe2\x88\x92\n\n\xe2\x88\x82a ( \xce\xbb )\n\xe2\x88\x82S\n\nS,\n\n(3.12)\n\nand to measured beam attenuation as\nTS\ncm ( \xce\xbb ) = cm ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92\n\n\xe2\x88\x82aw ( \xce\xbb )\n\n(T \xe2\x88\x92 Tr ) \xe2\x88\x92\n\n\xe2\x88\x82c ( \xce\xbb )\n\n(3.13)\nS.\n\xe2\x88\x82T\n\xe2\x88\x82S\nThe temperature dependence coefficients are listed in Table 1.1 (Pegau and Zaneveld 1993; Pegau et al 1997), and\nthe salinity dependence coefficients are provided by the manufacturer (Van Zee et al. 2002). Temperature and\nsalinity must be measured, using a CTD, concurrently with an ac-9 profile to apply these corrections using (3.12)\nand (3.13). Therefore, it is strongly recommended that the ac-9 be mounted on the same profiling package as an\naccurate CTD, and from this perspective, the priority of CTD measurements is higher than is implied in Table 3.1\n(Vol. I, Chapter 3).\nThese corrections become directly significant only at red and near-infrared wavelengths (see Table 1.1).\nTS\nTS\nHowever, the methods of the next section depend on accurate values of am ( \xce\xbb NIR ) and cm ( \xce\xbb NIR ) at a near-infrared\nreference wavelength \xce\xbb NIR \xe2\x89\x88 715 nm to determine scattering corrections at all wavelengths. Moreover, the\ntemperature correction in (3.12) must also be applied to laboratory spectrophotometric measurements of absorption\nby CDOM (Chapter 4), if the temperatures of the pure-water reference blank and filtered seawater sample differ\nsignificantly.\nScattering Corrections\nThe systematic scattering offsets between true absorption and absorption measured with a reflective tube\ninstrument, as described in equations (3.2) and (3.3) and related text in Sect. 3.1, were evaluated by Zaneveld et al.\n(1994). They recommended a hierarchy of three alternative methods for correcting the scattering offsets to the\nTS\ntemperature and salinity corrected measured absorption am ( \xce\xbb ) :\n1.\n\nSubtract the measured absorption at a near infrared reference wavelength, e.g. \xce\xbb NIR \xe2\x89\x88 715 nm for an ac-9,\nor \xce\xbb NIR \xe2\x89\x88 750 nm for measurements with a laboratory spectrophotometer (Chapter 4). After first applying\nthe temperature and salinity corrections using (3.12) and (3.13), assume that the a ( \xce\xbb NIR ) \xe2\x88\x92 aw ( \xce\xbb NIR ) \xe2\x89\x88 0\n\nand that the entire measured signal at the reference wavelength is due to wavelength independent\nscattering errors, so that\nTS\nTS\na ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 aw ( \xce\xbb ) = am ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 am ( \xce\xbb NIR ) .\n\n36\n\n(3.14)\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nTS\nThe value of am ( \xce\xbb NIR ) should be reported with the corrected absorption values when this method is used.\n\n2.\n\nAssuming a wavelength-independent scattering phase function appropriate for the type of particulates in a\ngiven water mass, and a weighting function W ( \xcf\x88 ) based on instrument characteristics [see equation (3.3)\nand the preceding discussion in Sect. 1.1 above], estimate the scattering error as a fraction \xce\xb5 of the\nmeasured scattering coefficient, and subtract it from the measured absorption at each wavelength, i.e.\nTS\nTS\nTS\na ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 aw ( \xce\xbb ) = am ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb5 \xef\xa3\xae cm ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 am ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 .\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n(3.15)\n\nBased on analyses of field measurements, laboratory experiments using an ac-9, and theoretical\ncalculations (Kirk 1992), the fraction \xce\xb5 varies from approximately 0.14 for predominately biological\nparticles in the open ocean (Case 1 waters) and increases to approximately 0.18 in waters were scattering\nis dominated by suspended sediments (Case 2 waters). Note that although the scattering correction using\n(3.15) is not sensitive to temperature and salinity corrections at wavelengths < 650 nm, it is nevertheless\nstrongly recommended that the temperature and salinity corrected values be used here as well - if for no\nother reason than facilitating quality control comparisons between corrections made by different methods.\n3.\n\nCombine methods 1 and 2, and the assumptions underlying both methods, to use the ac-9 measurements at\nthe reference wavelength to determine \xce\xb5 , so that (3.15) becomes\nTS\n\xef\xa3\xae\n\xef\xa3\xb9 TS\nam ( \xce\xbb NIR )\nTS\nTS\n(3.16)\na ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 aw ( \xce\xbb ) = am ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 \xef\xa3\xaf TS\n\xef\xa3\xba \xef\xa3\xaecm ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 am ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 .\nTS\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\xef\xa3\xaf cm ( \xce\xbb NIR ) \xe2\x88\x92 am ( \xce\xbb NIR ) \xef\xa3\xba\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nThe ac-9 instrument design constrains the scattering error fraction to \xce\xb5 \xe2\x89\xa5 0.07 (Kirk 1992), and although\nit is theoretically possible for \xce\xb5 to reach values exceeding 0.5, the authors have not encountered values\ngreater than 0.35.\n\nThe choice of which method should be used to correct scattering errors in ac-9 absorption measurements\ndepends largely on the combination of measured variables, the uncertainty of each measurements, and a judgment of\nhow likely the assumption that a ( \xce\xbb NIR ) \xe2\x88\x92 aw ( \xce\xbb NIR ) \xe2\x89\x88 0 is true in a given water mass.\n1.\n\n2.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to use Method 3 to apply the scattering correction, if all variables in (3.16) have\nbeen measured with acceptable uncertainty, and there is no reason to suspect that particle absorption is\nsignificant at the near-infrared reference wavelength \xce\xbb NIR .\nTS\nTS\nMethod 2 is recommended if both am ( \xce\xbb ) and cm ( \xce\xbb ) are available at one or more visible wavelengths,\nTS\nTS\nbut am ( \xce\xbb NIR ) and cm ( \xce\xbb NIR ) either were not measured with acceptable uncertainties, or there is reason to\n\nsuspect that a ( \xce\xbb NIR ) \xe2\x88\x92 aw ( \xce\xbb NIR ) > 0 .\n3.\n\nTS\nTS\nMethod 1 must be used if only am ( \xce\xbb ) and am ( \xce\xbb NIR ) are measured, as for example, when a laboratory\n\nbenchtop spectrophotometer is used to measure ag ( \xce\xbb ) in filtered water samples (Chapter 4). This situation\nmight also occur if the c side data of an ac-9 were lost due to an electronic failure, or blockage of its flowtube, and one wished to salvage the absorption profile measured with that instrument.\n\n3.7 QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES\nThere are several quality assurance tests that can be made to check how well an ac-9 is operating.\nWhen using intake filters for quality control measurements in tests of instrument performance, it is best to filter\nboth sides of an ac-9. This can be done by filtering one side at a time, and doing multiple profiles, or by connecting\na single filter and pump to both sides of the ac-9. When connecting to both sides using a single filter you are\nreducing an already low flow, which makes it more difficult to remove bubbles from the system, but it requires\nfewer casts to complete an instrument test. A degassing Y may be used on the outflow side of the combined\nplumbing arrangement to facilitate bubble removal.\n\n37\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nThe noise level in the measurements should be >0.005 m-1 at all channels. Measurements with noise exceeding\nthis criterion indicate instruments with large measurement noise, a rough check of quality of the calibration, and\npressure or temperature dependencies that may exist.\nAssuming that there is no measurable scattering by particles that pass through the filter then the filtered a and c\nmeasurements should be equal, and departures >0.005 m-1 are symptoms of drift in pure water calibration offsets, or\ncalibration errors due to optical impurity of the reference water.\nComparisons of profiles between successive down and up casts may help in separating suspected temperature\neffects from pressure dependencies. Evidence of hysteresis in different up and down profile responses to gradient\nfeatures is symptomatic of a problem with an instrument\xe2\x80\x99s internal temperature compensation Care must be taken in\nthis interpretation, however, because the upcast water intake is taken in the wake of the rising package and\nturbulence may also cause apparent hysteresis symptoms to appear in the measurements. Pressure effects should not\nhave hysteresis.\nIf more than one ac-9 is available, it is useful to plumb both instruments in identical configurations (both with,\nor without an intake filter) on the same instrument and measure a quick sequence of comparative profiles to\nintercalibrate the instruments. The profile data from the two instruments should be compared only after each has\nbeen fully processed and corrected for temperature, salinity and scattering errors (Sect. 3.4). Discrepancies in this\ntype of comparison cannot indicate which instrument is incorrect, but does provide a clear indication that the\ncalibration of one, or both, is not correct.\n\nREFERENCES\nJames, H.R., and E.A.

The absorption coefficient a ( \xce\xbb ) , in m , at any point within a natural water body can be described\n-1\n\nin terms of the additive contribution of its components as\n\na ( \xce\xbb ) = aw ( \xce\xbb ) + ap ( \xce\xbb ) + ag ( \xce\xbb ) , m-1,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere aw ( \xce\xbb ) , ap ( \xce\xbb ) and ag ( \xce\xbb ) are the spectral absorption coefficients of water, particles, and soluble\ncomponents, respectively. The spectral absorption coefficients of pure water adopted for the protocols are given in\nTable 1.1 (Ch. 1), and combine the results of Pope and Fry (1997), Sogandares and Fry (1997), Fry (2000) and Kou\net al. (1993). The depth (z) dependence of the absorption coefficients is omitted for brevity. The particle absorption\ncoefficient may be further decomposed as\n\nap ( \xce\xbb ) = a\xcf\x86 ( \xce\xbb ) + ad ( \xce\xbb ) , m-1,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere a\xcf\x86 ( \xce\xbb ) and ad ( \xce\xbb ) are the spectral absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, and de-pigmented particles,\nrespectively. Laboratory methods are described for determining operational estimates of these fractions. It is\nconceptually possible to further separate ad ( \xce\xbb ) into absorption fractions due to de-pigmented organic and\n\ninorganic particles, but at present, there are no well established protocols for separately determining the absorption\ncoefficient for inorganic particles.\nTo interpret aquatic spectral reflectance and better understand photochemical and photobiological processes in\nnatural waters, it is essential to quantify the contributions of the individual constituents to the total absorption\ncoefficients in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible region of the spectrum. The protocols presented here are based on\nthe evolution, starting with articles by Kalle (1938) and Yentsch (1962), of methods for analyzing the absorption by\nsoluble and particulate material in natural waters. Laboratory measurements and data analysis protocols are\ndescribed for separating the total spectral absorption coefficient, a ( \xce\xbb ) , into its components by spectrophotometric\nmeasurements of samples prepared from filtration of discrete water samples.\nThe spectral absorbance of the filters and filtrate from these samples, as measured in a spectrophotometer, are\nexpressed in units of Optical Density ( OD ), defined as OD ( \xce\xbb ) = Log 10 \xef\xa3\xaeVo ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 \xe2\x88\x92 Log 10 \xef\xa3\xaeVt ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 . Vo ( \xce\xbb ) is the\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\nspectrometer response for spectral flux transmitted through the reference material and Vt ( \xce\xbb ) is the response for\n\nspectral flux transmitted through the sample. For the methods presented here the reference is either a properly\nhydrated GF/F blank filter for particle absorption, or a clean quartz glass optical cuvette filled directly from a\n\n39\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\npurified water source for soluble material absorption. Note that OD is a dimensionless quantity. The use of base10 logarithms in this context is a carryover from common practice in chemical spectroscopy and is the typical output\nof commercial spectrophotometers routinely used for these methods. Therefore, it is necessary to convert the OD\nmeasurements described in this chapter to the base-e representation of absorbance, i.e. to multiply OD by 2.303, to\nconform to the convention used throughout the ocean optics protocols. In general, these protocols are written\nassuming that the instrument that is used directly computes the optical density of the sample relative to the\nappropriate reference sample.\nThere has been considerable research to develop robust protocols that provide the most accurate estimates of\nabsorption for various material fractions in natural waters. NASA-sponsored workshops were held at Scripps\nInstitution of Oceanography and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences to review absorption protocols, evaluate\ninstrumentation, and define areas of consensus as well as areas of uncertainty that warrant further research (Mitchell\net al. 2000).\nThe most widely used approach for estimating absorption by particulate matter in water samples involves\nanalysis of the particles concentrated on filters (Yentsch, 1957). Absorption of phytoplankton suspensions\ndetermined using procedures that capture most of the forward scattered light (Shibata, 1958) can be related to the\nabsorption measured on the filters to make quantitative corrections for the pathlength amplification effect (\xce\xb2) caused\nby the highly scattering filter medium (Duntley, 1942; Butler, 1962). The pathlength amplification parameter was\nsymbolized as \xce\xb2 by Kiefer and SooHoo (1982) following the nomenclature of Butler (1962). This symbol should\nnot to be confused with the volume scattering coefficient \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb , \xce\xa8 ) used in other chapters of this Technical\nMemorandum.\nKiefer and SooHoo (1982) reported a constant to scale the red peak of chlorophyll absorption for natural\nparticles retained on GF/C filters to the diffuse absorption coefficients determined on suspensions by Kiefer et al.\n(1979). The diffuse absorption coefficient is double the value of the volume absorption coefficient of interest here\n(Preisendorfer, 1976). Mitchell and Kiefer (1984, 1988a) made direct estimates of volume absorption coefficients\nfor phytoplankton suspensions and absorbance on glass fiber filters with the same particles to develop empirical\nequations that relate the amplification factor to the glass fiber sample optical density. This procedure is the basis of\nmost laboratory methods for determining particle absorption in water samples.\nField applications of these quantitative estimates of ap ( \xce\xbb ) were reported by Mitchell and Kiefer (1984,\n1988b) and Bricaud and Stramski (1990). More detailed empirical results to correct for pathlength amplification\nwere reported by Mitchell (1990) for various filter types and diverse cultures coccoid cyanobacteria,\nnanochlorophytes, diatoms, chrysophytes and dinoflagellates with sizes ranging from 2 \xc2\xb5m to 20 \xc2\xb5m. Cleveland\nand Weidemann (1993) and Tassan and Ferrari (1995) found that the empirical relationships of Mitchell (1990) were\nconsistent with similar types of phytoplankton, but Moore et al. (1995) reported large differences in the\namplification factor for Synechococcus sp. (WH8103) and Prochlorococcus marinus that were about half the size of\nthe smallest cells studied by Mitchell (1990). Similar results were obtained by Allali et al. (1997) for natural\npopulations of the Equatorial Pacific dominated by picoplankton. For samples with substantial turbidity and\nscattering due to inorganic matter (coastal, shelf, coccolithophore blooms), methods to correct for resulting artifacts\nhave been described by Tassan and Ferrari (1995a, 1995b). Table 4.1 provides a summary of various published\nresults for pathlength amplification factors.\nSeparation of the particle fraction into phytoplankton and other components is of considerable ecological and\nbiogeochemical interest. Early efforts to separate absorbing components for natural particles included treatment\nwith organic solvents, UV radiation, and potassium permanganate (references can be found in Shifrin, 1988, and\nBricaud and Stramski, 1990). The most widely used chemical method is based on methanol extraction (Kishino et\nal. 1985, 1986). A recent method consists of bleaching the phytoplankton pigments by sodium hypochlorite (Tassan\nand Ferrari, 1995a; Ferrari and Tassan, 1999). Spectral fluorescence methods to estimate the fraction of\nphotosynthetically active absorption, if separate total particulate absorption has been determined, have been reported\nby Sosik and Mitchell, (1995).\nSoluble absorption observations were described by Bricaud et al. (1981) for diverse ocean environments,\nincluding oligotrophic and eutrophic regions. Other field reports can be found in the references listed in more recent\narticles (Carder et al., 1989a, 1989b; Blough et al., 1993; Vodacek et al., 1996; Hoge et al., 1993; Nelson et al.,\n1998; D\xe2\x80\x99Sa et al., 1999). Spectrophotometric measurement of absorption by dissolved materials is straightforward,\n\n40\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nbut has limits due to the very small signal for short pathlengths routinely employed (usually 10 cm), and to\ndifficulties in maintaining quality control of purified water used as a reference.\nThis chapter defines protocols for the operational determinations of absorption coefficients for particulate and\nsoluble matter in water samples. Methods are specified for separating particulate and soluble material by filtration,\npartitioning total particulate absorption into contributions by phytoplankton and de-pigmented particles (detritus),\nand corrections for pathlength amplification due to semi-diffuse transmittance of the filters. Recommendations are\nmade based on widely accepted methods and processing procedures. NASA-sponsored workshops have confirmed\nvarious aspects of previously reported methods (Mitchell et al. 2000).\n\n4.2 SAMPLE ACQUISITION\nWater samples should be taken using Niskin (or similar) bottles at the site of, and simultaneously with, the\nsurface in-water optical measurements, and at depth increments sufficient to resolve variability within at least the\ntop optical depth. When possible, samples should be acquired at several depths distributed throughout the upper\n300m of the water column (or in turbid water, up to seven diffuse attenuation depths for PAR irradiance,\nln(E(0)/E(z))=7), to provide a basis for relating the spectroscopic measurements of absorption to in situ profile\nmeasurements. Samples should be drawn immediately from the in situ sampling bottles into clean sampling bottles\nusing clean silicon rubber or Tygon tubing or by directly filling the sample bottles from the Niskin bottle spigot. If\nNiskin bottles will not be sampled immediately, precautions must be taken to ensure large particles that settle are resuspended. This can be done by transferring all water from the Niskin to a bottle or carboy larger than the total\nvolume of the Niskin so that the entire water sample can be mixed (invert bottle numerous times to mix by\nturbulence), or by draining a small amount of water from the Niskin and manually inverting the entire Niskin prior\nto sub-sampling. Sample bottles should be kept cool (ideally near in situ temperatures), and dark prior to sample\npreparations. Preparations should be completed as soon as possible after sampling, but no later than several hours\nafter the sample was acquired.\n\n4.3 SPECTROPHOTOMETER CHARACTERISTICS AND CALIBRATION\nA spectrophotometer used for absorption measurements following the protocols presented in this chapter must\nmeet the following minimum performance specifications:\n1.\n\nThe unit\xe2\x80\x99s monochromator, or spectrograph, must yield a Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM)\nbandwidth \xe2\x89\xa4 4 nm . A larger FWHM bandwidth will not adequately resolve the red chlorophyll a\nabsorption band.\n\n2.\n\nThe instrument\xe2\x80\x99s baseline spectrum characteristics, specified below, must be maintained over the range\nfrom 300 nm to 850 nm for measuring absorption by particles concentrated on filters, and from 250 nm to\n850 nm for measuring absorption by dissolved materials.\n\n3.\n\nFor measuring absorption by particles concentrated on filters, baseline noise must be <0.01 OD , and noise\n<0.005 OD is strongly recommended.\n\n4.\n\nFor measuring absorption by dissolved materials, baseline noise must be <0.001 OD units, and noise\n<0.0005 OD is strongly recommended.\n\n5.\n\nThe instrument\xe2\x80\x99s baseline spectrum must be relatively flat over the wavelength range of interest and its\nshape and magnitude must be stable over time. Any tendencies for the spectral shape and magnitude of an\ninstrument\xe2\x80\x99s baseline to drift must be well-behaved and slow enough that the rate of baseline drift may be\ncharacterized with an uncertainty less than the noise levels specified above. It is recommended to check\nthe instrument baseline at intervals of 1 hr to 2 hr during an extended series of measurements.\n\nOther desirable, but not absolutely essential, spectrophotometer features are variable slit width (to allow reducing\nthe FWHM spectral resolution, when desired), automatic baseline corrections (the adequacy of which must\nnevertheless be verified), and automatic spectral calibration during instrument warm-up (using mercury emission\nlines supplied by an internal lamp source).\nThe spectral accuracy of the spectrometer should be verified by scanning a holmium oxide filter, with reference\nto an air-to-air baseline. This spectral calibration should be repeated each time the instrument is turned on, and at\n\n41\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nthe conclusion of a series of measurements. Alternatively, a spectrophotometer\xe2\x80\x99s spectral characteristics may be\ncalibrated using an internal line source (e.g. a mercury lamp), if the instrument is so equipped, but independent\nchecks with the holmium oxide filter are also strongly advised. A set of absorbance reference filter standards, of\nknown OD , must be used to calibrate a spectrophotometer\xe2\x80\x99s responses over the range of OD associated with the\nsamples to be measured. This calibration, together with instrument baseline spectrum determinations, should be\nrepeated at intervals necessary to characterize (within the noise tolerances given above) any measurable drifts in the\ninstrument baseline and/or OD response. Unless the investigator can confirm the stability of the instrument that is\nused, these calibration procedures should be repeated each time the spectrophotometer is turned on. As a minimum\nthey should be performed at any time there is a change of lamp source, blocking filter, or other instrument setup\ncharacteristic that affects the optical response and on a regular basis during routine work.\nThe present version of these protocols is written assuming the use of a commercial dual-beam\nspectrophotometer, with the sample and reference targets illuminated by the collimated output of a grating\nmonochromator. The protocols also apply, with minimal modifications, to measurements using a single-beam\nmonochromator or otherwise similar optical configuration. Mitchell et al. (2000) report comparisons between OD\nmeasurements of a common set of GF/F filtered particle samples using several spectrophotometers of these types, as\nwell as spectrophotometers based on very different optical configurations. For a diatom culture measured during the\nScripps workshop, several commercial dual beam spectrophotometers estimated sample filter OD spectra\nconsistently within 5 % (Figure 4.1). Some of the differently configured instruments were within 10 % of the\nselected reference dual-beam instrument but in some cases had limited spectral range either in the UV or the nearinfrared, or both (data not shown). The largest divergence was found for a grating spectrograph instrument that\nilluminates the filter with diffuse white light (Figure 4.1). This unit yielded OD values that were significantly\nhigher than, albeit linearly related to (with a slope of approximately 0.7), the OD measurements made with\nconventional dual beam spectrophotometers (Mitchell et al. 2000). This result indicates that the pathlength\namplification (\xce\xb2 factor) associated with this instrument is significantly different from previously published values\n(Table 4.1), which were derived using conventional dual beam spectrophotometers. An investigator using this type\nof spectrophotometer, or another design with yet a different optical configuration, must either compare filter OD\nspectra measurements to reference measurements on the same filters with a \xe2\x80\x9cconventional\xe2\x80\x9d spectrophotometer to\nderive an OD scaling function, or otherwise determine pathlength amplification factors for the instrument\nconfiguration, using methods discussed in Mitchell et al. (2000) and references cited therein.\n\n4.4 PARTICLE ABSORPTION: SAMPLE FILTER PREPARATION AND\nANALYSIS\nThe procedures described in this section are recommended for determining the spectral absorption coefficients\nof particles in discrete samples of natural waters. These laboratory measurements are complementary to methods for\nmeasuring in situ profiles of absorption, as described in Chapter 3 of this volume, and provide additional\ninformation on the partition of particle absorption by phytoplankton and other particles. Water samples are filtered\nand absorbance spectra of the filter, OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) ,are estimated for the retained particles using a laboratory\nspectrophotometer. After measurement, the sample filters are soaked in chemical solvents to extract, or bleach,\nphytoplankton pigments (Kishino et al., 1985; Tassan and Ferrari 1995a) then rinsed to remove the chemicals and\npigments from the material retained on the filter. The OD fd ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum of the filter is then determined in the\nspectrophotometer to obtain the absorption component of the de-pigmented particles, which are sometimes referred\nto as detritus or tripton. Depending on the method used to de-pigment the samples, this fraction also includes\nbleached cells and phycobilipigments that are not extractable in methanol and also inorganic minerals that may be\nimportant absorbers in some water samples. The raw OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) and OD fd ( \xce\xbb ) data are used to calculate total\nparticulate and de-pigmented absorption coefficients ap ( \xce\xbb ) and ad ( \xce\xbb ) , respectively. The absorption coefficient of\nphytoplankton, a\xcf\x86 ( \xce\xbb ) , is then calculated as the difference ap ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 ad ( \xce\xbb ) .\nFiltration\nThe Whatman GF/F\xef\x9b\x9b filter (which is binder-free and combustible, with a nominal pore size of 0.7 \xc2\xb5m) is\nrecommended for particle absorption sampling. This type of filter is also recommended by (JGOFS 1991) for\n\n42\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nvarious particulate and pigment analyses. Some authors have reported that particulate material less than 0.7 \xc2\xb5m in\nsize will not be retained by the GF/F filter, and that this fraction may contain up to 10 % or 15 % of the\nphytoplankton biomass as measured by chlorophyll concentration. Chavez et al. (1995), however, found no\nstatistical difference between GF/F and 0.2 \xc2\xb5m filters for chlorophyll and productivity measurements. The\nabsorption of particles having diameters between 0.22 \xc2\xb5m and 0.7 \xc2\xb5m may be selectively determined by filtering the\nGF/F filtrate again through a 0.22 \xc2\xb5m Millipore cellulose acetate membrane filter, and measuring its absorbance\nwith a spectrophotometer (Ferrari and Tassan, 1996). Note that Mitchell (1990) reported pathlength amplification\nfactors for cellulose acetate filters that are substantially different than those for GF/F filters and also described the\nrelative difficulty of keeping cellulose acetate filters properly hydrated.\nThe optical transparency of the GF/F filter relative to air decreases significantly below 380 nm but many\nspectrophotometers can still make optical density determinations to 300 nm with these filters. The transparency of\nthe filter also increases with hydration; so all samples must be fully - but not excessively - hydrated for proper\nperformance of analytical procedures and accurate optical corrections. Pre-soaking GF/F filters 1 to 2 hrs before use\ncan lead to less variability between individual filters (Bricaud and Stramski 1990). For oceanic water samples,\nseawater filtered through a 0.2 \xc2\xb5m filter should be used to hydrate the filters. Freshly filtered seawater should be\nused since water that is left standing in clear containers may grow considerable amounts of algae over relatively\nshort periods of time if there are any nutrients in the filtered seawater. For fresh inland water samples, purified fresh\nwater may be used.\nGlass fiber, cellulose acetate, and other strongly diffusing filters have large scattering coefficients, which\nincrease the optical path length of photons in the measurement beam. Filtration volume Vf should be adjusted so\nthat the optical densities of the filter samples, relative to the blank filter satisfy the criteria that\n0.05 < OD fp ( 675 ) \xe2\x89\xa4 0.25 and OD fp ( 440 ) \xe2\x89\xa4 0.4 OD (Mitchell 1990). Optical density spectra of the sample filters\nshould be measured as soon as possible following filtration, because pigment decomposition may occur (Stramski\n1990). If filters must be stored, immediately place the unfolded filters into flat tissue containers designed for liquid\nnitrogen storage. Liquid nitrogen storage is recommended because alternative freezing methods were shown to have\nmore artifacts in comparison tests (Sosik, 1999).\na. Sample Filter Preparation\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCollect water samples, and maintain them in the dark at, or near, in situ water temperature.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPrepare 0.2 \xc2\xb5m filtered seawater (FSW) in sufficient volume for hydrating sample and blank filters.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSet up and maintain the filter apparatus in dim light to minimize photodegradation of the samples.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFor each sample, place a GF/F filter onto the filtration rig. Also prepare two blank GF/F filters by soaking\nthem in ~25 ml of 0.2 \xc2\xb5m filtered water while mounted on the filtration funnel (with valves closed) during\nthe sample filtration.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFilter the samples on GF/F filters under low vacuum (~125 mm Hg).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFilter a sufficient volume of water Vf to yield sample optical density relative to the blank filter in the range\nspecified above. For field samples collected in the upper 100-150 m and filtered onto 25 mm GF/F filters,\nVf is typically in the range 0.5 L to 5 L, depending on the in situ density concentration of particles.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDo not let the preparations run dry during filtration. Turn off the vacuum to each sample as it completes\nfiltering. Immediately place samples on a drop of 0.2 \xc2\xb5m FSW in the appropriate container, depending on\nhow they will be stored.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRecord the filter and filtration funnel type, the diameter Df of the area on the filter that contains the\nconcentrated particles, and the volume of water filtered Vf.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMeasure the absorption spectra in a spectrophotometer, or store the filters in liquid nitrogen, as soon as\npossible.\n\n43\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nb. Sample Filter Storage\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIf the filter samples will be analyzed immediately, store each filter in a labeled petri dish (e.g. Gelman\xef\x9b\x9b\nsnap-top dishes). Ensure proper hydration of the sample by placing the GF/F filter on a small drop of 0.2\n\xc2\xb5m FSW. Store each filter sample in the dark and refrigerate it (~4 deg. C) until it is to be measured in the\nspectrophotometer.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIf the spectrophotometric measurements will be delayed more than 24 hours following sample filtration, the\nfilter samples should be prepared for liquid nitrogen storage. Samples should be stored in containers that\nallow the filter to remain flat, and which are specifically designed for immersion in liquid nitrogen (e.g.\nFisher Histoprep\xef\x9b\x9b tissue capsules). One pair of blank filters should also be prepared each day for use as\nthe reference blank for samples collected that day. Samples may be stored in liquid nitrogen for extended\nperiods, but it is strongly recommended to analyze them as soon as possible.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNon-pressurized liquid nitrogen dewars generally retain liquid nitrogen for 2-4 weeks. Pressurized liquid\nnitrogen dewars can be rented at low cost for extended cruises (4-5 weeks) so that the sample dewars may\nbe replenished and kept full. Care must be taken at sea, and in return shipping, to ensure that the samples\nare properly frozen. Samples should be shipped in liquid nitrogen dry shippers, which will maintain proper\ntemperatures for 2 to 3 weeks, if they are properly charged and in good condition.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAir transport of liquid nitrogen dry shippers is approved under International Air Transportation Agreement\n(IATA 41st Edition Section A800; US Federal Aviation Administration Dangerous Good Bulletin DGAB98-03; August 25, 1998). That approval notwithstanding, many investigators have experienced difficulties\nin clearing customs, and in transport of liquid nitrogen dry shippers via commercial airfreight, or as\nchecked baggage. The investigator should contact the carriers in advance and provide the IATA approval\nand FAA bulletins pertaining to liquid nitrogen dry shipper transport. If the dry shipper is to be transported\nas checked baggage, advanced coordination with the airline is strongly recommended to avoid confiscation\nof samples and delays in return shipment. When samples are shipped as checked baggage or freight, the\nIATA memo, DOT memo, and manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s certificate should be affixed to the dry shipper to minimize\npotential delays.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTemporary storage of filter samples on dry ice can be considered during transport. But maximum duration\nof dry ice in insulated shipping boxes is several days, so the use of liquid nitrogen dry shippers is strongly\nrecommended.\n\nDetermination of spectral optical density of sample filters\nAfter preparation, the optical density spectrum of each sample filter is measured using a laboratory\nspectrophotometer. The performance characteristics and calibration requirements of the spectrophotometer used for\nthese measurements are described above in Section 4.3.\na. Reference Blank Spectra\nWith a dual beam spectrophotometer, two reference filter blanks saturated with FSW are used to measure the\nreference spectrum, and one is left in the reference beam during sample measurements. For typical single beam\ninstruments, generally the reference is scanned, and then samples are placed into the beam and scanned. Most\nmodern spectrophotometers, whether single or double beam, automatically store the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s reference spectrum\nand recorded sample spectra are automatically corrected to yield OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) relative to the reference blank filter. A\nnew instrument reference baseline scan should be measured each time the spectrophotometer is powered up, and\nwhenever its configuration has been changed. The baseline should also be checked regularly (every 1 hr to 2 hr)\nduring extended periods of analysis. Frequency of baseline verification will depend on the performance and stability\nof each instrument and should be determined by the investigator prior to executing routine work. Uncorrected\nbaseline drift, and changes in sorting filters or lamp source can cause systematic measurement anomalies.\nWavelength accuracy and measurement precision should also be checked during the analyses (Sect. 4.3 above).\n\n44\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nb. Spectrophotometric Measurement Procedure\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWarm up the spectrophotometer for 30 minutes.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMeasure the initial instrument baseline and wavelength calibration.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIf using frozen samples, remove the filters from the storage container and place them in petri dishes on\nFSW to ensure hydration. Allow the samples to thaw for approximately 5 min and then refrigerate them in\nthe dark until each filter is ready for analysis.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn instrument-specific sample-mounting device is recommended to hold filters against a quartz glass\nmounting plate. These mounts should be secure when placed in the sample compartment and hold the\nsample perpendicular to the illumination beam so only the filter and the quartz plate are in the beam.\nUsually, these mounts must be custom fabricated specifically for each different instrument.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nClean the quartz faceplates of the mounting device with purified water and detergent if needed. Rinse them\nwith purified water and ethanol, and dry them thoroughly using lint-free laboratory tissues.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSet the appropriate instrument parameters according to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMount two pre-soaked and water saturated blank filters (one for the sample beam, and one for the reference\nbeam).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo test for proper filter hydration, confirm that there is a drop of FSW left on the mounting plate when the\nfilter is lifted. With the filter on the mounting plate there should be a slight sheen on the top surface of the\nfilter, and a very narrow (~1 mm) border of water around the edges of the filter. Be careful not to use too\nmuch water, or the sample may wash away.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nExamine the back of the filter on the mounting plate to be sure that no bubbles are trapped between the\nfilter and the quartz glass plate on the sample holder. There should be a uniform layer of water between the\nfilter and quartz glass mounting plate. If bubbles are present, which will be obvious, pick up the filter with\nforceps, and replace it on the plate with a slight dragging motion across a drop of filtered seawater. Reinspect the back of the filter and repeat the foregoing procedure until no bubbles are present. Adjust the\namount of FSW as necessary to ensure proper hydration.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAlternative mounts that expose both sides of the filter to air may be used to avoid bubbles altogether.\nSample hydration is more difficult to maintain when using this type of filter mount so the investigator must\ndevelop a satisfactory procedure to ensure proper hydration of sample and reference.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRun the instrument baseline correction using the two blanks. For most commercial units, this baseline will\nbe automatically used as the reference to calculate OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) . Immediately after the baseline correction is\nfinished, and without touching the blank filters, run the two blanks as a sample scan to confirm that\nbaseline performance is within acceptable tolerance over the spectral range of determination (Sect. 4.3\nabove). This spectrum should be flat spectrally. Baseline noise less than \xc2\xb1 0.005 OD is recommended.\nSave this scan for confirmation of instrument performance. If a spectrally flat baseline cannot be achieved\nover the spectral range of interest, the stored baseline must be subtracted from subsequent measurements of\nsample filter OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIf using a single beam instrument, or instruments run in the single beam mode the blank is not kept in the\ninstrument so one does not need to rehydrate the blank reference filter regularly. Most modern single beam\nspectrophotometers will also automatically use the blank reference stored in memory for estimates\nof OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRemove the blank filter from the quartz glass sample mount in the measurement beam, and replace it with a\nsample filter, ensuring proper hydration of the sample (see above).\nMeasure the sample\nOD fp ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum, save it in a digital file, and record all relevant information.\n\n45\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe blank reference filter will dry out over time, and must be hydrated regularly. If absorption signal\ndeviates significantly from zero (more than 0.02 OD ) in the infrared (750-800 nm), this often indicates a\ndry reference or sample filter. If using a quartz plate, check the reference filter after every 5-6 scans, and\nhydrate as needed. If the filters are mounted in air, hydrate the blank before every scan.\n\nSample Filter Preparation for De-pigmented Particle Absorption\nAfter preparing an ap ( \xce\xbb ) filter sample and determining its OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum on the spectrophotometer, the\nsample should be processed to remove its pigments and determine ad ( \xce\xbb ) . The shape of the ad ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum\nusually decreases monotonically with wavelength, following exponential form that is flatter than the shape of the\nsoluble absorption spectrum. Since the goal is generally to get an estimate of phytoplankton absorption, if there is a\nresidual chlorophyll a absorption peak in the red near 675 nm, the extraction process should be repeated to remove\nit. Variations of this method include use of hot or boiling methanol and varying extraction times. Use of hot\nmethanol has risks due to flammability, and volatility. If this process is used, extra precautions must be taken.\nBleaching of the organic pigments can also be accomplished for situations with difficult to extract pigments\nincluding phycobilins or other chemically polar pigments that do not extract well in methanol. Pigment extraction in\na chemical solvent, such as methanol, is a fundamentally different chemical process than bleaching the pigments\nusing sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). Bleaching involves placing a small amount of 0.1 % active chlorine solution\nonto the filter, then rinsing it off with FSW. The NaClO oxidizes the pigment molecules, making their light\nabsorption negligible. FSW rinses then remove the excess NaClO, which absorbs negligibly at wavelengths\n>400 nm, but absorbs strongly at shorter wavelengths. The bleaching method of pigment removal has been shown\nto be effective in situations where methanol cannot be used, as on cellulose membranes such as the 0.22 \xc2\xb5m\nMillipore filter, or when phycobilins are present (Tassan and Ferrari 1995a; Mitchell et al. 2000). This procedure\ncan also be adapted for use with particulate suspensions.\nNeither methanol extraction, nor NaClO oxidation, provides an ideal means of separating particulate absorption\ninto \xe2\x80\x98algal\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98detrital\xe2\x80\x99 components. In each case, the action of the chemical agent is not well understood, and in\nmany situations the two methods will yield very different results. The decision to apply either the bleaching, or\nmethanol extraction, method will depend on the situation. For example, in inland waters where either cyanobacteria,\nor chlorophytes, are dominant, the bleaching technique is preferred, because of the presence of phycobilins and of\nextraction resistant algae (e.g. Porra 1990). In coastal oceanic waters, on the other hand, the methanol technique is\npreferred, because the results will be comparable to previously published results and there is no particular advantage\nto using bleach. In open-ocean samples (e.g. the Sargasso Sea), however, absorption by phycobilins is small, but\npresent in some particulate absorption samples and in methanol-extracted filters (N.B. Nelson unpublished data).\nThe methanol technique will provide results which are comparable to earlier studies, but with errors due to\nincomplete extraction and wavelength shifts in the phycobilin absorption bands.\na. Methanol Extraction method\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReplace the sample and blank filters on the filtration system. Treat blank filters exactly as if they were\nsample filters.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAdd 5 mL to 10 mL of 100 % methanol to each filter by gently pouring it down the sides of the filter funnel\nto minimize resuspension of the sample particles, and let stand for 1 min.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFilter the methanol through the sample, turn off the vacuum, close the valves and add 10 - 15 mL of\nmethanol.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAllow the sample to stand in methanol for approximately 1 hr. Do not allow the filter to go dry during the\nextraction period. Time of extraction will vary depending on the filter load and phytoplankton species\ncomposition. Place aluminum foil over the filtration cups to minimize contamination during extraction.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAfter extraction is complete, turn on the vacuum and draw the methanol and dissolved pigments through\nthe filter. Rinse the sides of the filter tower twice with small amounts of methanol. Finally, rinse the sides\nof the filter tower three times with ~20 mL of 0.2 \xc2\xb5m FSW. Also rinse the blanks with FSW after methanol\nextraction to minimize filter dehydration during spectrophotometric analysis.\n\n46\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPigment extraction is complete when the 675 nm chlorophyll a absorption peak is not present in the\nOD fd ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSuccessive, short extractions of 10 minutes can sometimes improve the pigment extraction.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPhycobilins, and some eukaryotic pigments, will not be extracted efficiently by methanol.\n\nb. Sodium Hypochlorite oxidation method\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPrepare NaClO solution:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFor freshwater samples: 0.1 % active chlorine in purified water (e.g. Milli-Q water).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFor marine samples: 0.1 % active chlorine in purified water containing 60 gl-1 Na2SO4, to match osmotic\npressure of sample cells.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe volume of 0.1% active chlorine solution needed to bleach pigments from a filter sample has been\nempirically shown to be approximately 3OD fp ( 440 ) mL .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPlace the sample, particle side up, on the filtration system (closed valves).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGently pour the solution down the sides of the filter funnel.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLet the solution act for 5 min to 10 min, adding solution as necessary to compensate for loss through the\nfilter.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCover the filtration cup with aluminum foil to prevent contamination during bleaching.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRinse the sample by gentle filtration of 50 mL of water (either fresh water or FSW, depending on sample\nsource).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nComplete bleaching of the pigments is indicated by the absence of a 675 nm peak, together with a concave\nshape near 440 nm, in the OD fd ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum of the bleached filter. If evidence of residual pigment\nabsorption persists, repeat the NaClO oxidation treatment, as indicated above.\n\nSpectrophotometric Measurement of De-pigmented Optical Density Spectra\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe OD fd ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum of the de-pigmented samples should be measured in the spectrophotometer, as\ndescribed above for OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNote that methanol-extracted sample and blank filters will tend to dry out quickly if the methanol is not\nthoroughly rinsed from the filters prior to spectrophotometric measurements.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNaClO oxidized sample and reference filters must be thoroughly rinsed with FSW (or fresh water for\ninland water samples) to extend the spectral range below 400 nm.\n\n4.5 SOLUBLE ABSORPTION SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS\nThe measurement methods described in this section are used to determine ag ( \xce\xbb ) , the spectral absorption\ncoefficient spectrum of gelbstoff, often referred to as dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Water samples are\ncollected and particulate material is removed by filtration. The absorption of the filtrate is measured, relative to\npurified water, using a spectrophotometer. All equipment utilized to prepare soluble absorption samples must\nminimize contamination by organic, or otherwise colored, material. Samples must be protected from photodegradation during preparation and measurements. Plastic or glass filtration apparatus may be used, provided that\nthe units are equipped with mesh filter supports made either of stainless steel or plastic, and not with ground glass\nfrits. Glass frits tend to become clogged over time, and may cause uneven distribution on the filter, reduce the rate\nof filtration and may contaminate the sample filtrate.\n\n47\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nMembrane filters with 0.2 \xc2\xb5m pore size (e.g., Nuclepore\xef\x9b\x9b polycarbonate filters) are recommended for this\nprocedure. The membrane filters should be pre-soaked in 10% HCl, rinsed with 75-100 mL of freshly purified\nwater, and rinsed again with a 75 \xe2\x80\x93 100 mL of the sample before it is used. Tests with purified water have shown\nthat all filters leach contamination that resembles soluble absorption (data not shown). Using polycarbonate\nmembrane filters, an acid soak, pure water rinse and sample rinse minimizes this contamination. Still, we have\nfound the sample preparation procedure increases the apparent absorption spectra of purified water that is prepared\nas though it were a sample when referenced to purified water drawn directly into the measuring cuvette from the\npure water system. Therefore correction for this sample preparation blank is recommended.\nGlass fiber filters should be avoided if possible because they have been shown to cause rather severe\ncontamination of the filtrate in tests using purified water. For samples collected from very turbid waters, glass fiber\nfilters have routinely been used as a pre-filter to minimize clogging of the final filtration with a membrane filter\n(Kowalczuk, 1999). In such cases the investigator must develop a procedure to rinse the glass fiber filter to ensure\nthat the contamination from this method is minimized. Since situations requiring pre-filtration often coincide with\nlarge soluble absorption coefficients, the effects may be easily corrected but it is the responsibility of the\ninvestigator to demonstrate this. Careful assessment of the contamination of any method, and proper corrections\nmust be carried out and reported.\nPreviously we recommended the use of amber-colored borosilicate glass bottles (e.g. Qorpak\xef\x9b\x9b bottles), that\nscreen ambient light, for sample preparation and to store laboratory prepared standard water. However, recent work\n(details not shown) indicate that the amber bottles may leach some colored material into the purified standard water\nthat is prepared before cruises and used to assess the quality of purified water prepared at sea. Therefore we now\nrecommend use of clear borosilicate Qorpak\xef\x9b\x9b bottles (or equivalent) for sample preparations and for the\npreparation of the standard reference water. Prior to each experiment, all filtration apparatus and storage bottles\nshould be thoroughly cleaned.\nPurified water for soluble absorption measurements\nPurified water freshly drawn from a water purification system, such as the Millipore Milli-Q, Millipore AlphaQ, and Barnstead Nanopure units, or their equivalent, is strongly recommended for use at sea in preparing pure\nwater for absorption reference, blanks and for equipment rinses specified in these protocols. Mitchell et al. (2000)\ncompared the water-to-air baseline reference of purified water prepared with these three water purification systems.\nAll three systems provided similar results in baseline tests relative to air at wavelengths between 300 nm and\n900 nm, while small differences were found below 300 nm. It is also recommended to prepare a set of standard\npurified water samples prior to a field deployment as a reference to check daily for pure-water system degradation,\ne.g. due to poor quality feed water. Even though bottled purified water standards have been found to deteriorate\nslightly over time, especially from 250 nm to 325 nm, they provide invaluable quality control and an alternative\nsource of reference water in situations when the purification system performance degrades dramatically.\nPre-cruise preparations\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSample bottles (clear borosilicate Qorpak\xef\x9b\x9b with polyethylene lined caps) used to collect sample filtrate or\nto store standard reference water need to be thoroughly cleaned in advance to remove any potential organic\ncontaminants. Sequential soaks and rinses in dilute detergent, purified water, and 10 % HCl, followed by a\nfinal copious rinse in purified water, are recommended.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRinse plastic caps with 10 % HCl, twice with freshly prepared purified water (e.g. using a Millipore AlphaQ system), and dry them at 70o C for 4 hr to 6 hr.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCombust bottles with aluminum foil covers at 450o C for 4 hr to 6 hr.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFill clean, combusted bottles with fresh purified water drawn directly from the purification unit.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAssemble the combusted bottles and clean caps. Store in the dark.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThese standards are used daily during cruises to evaluate the quality of purified water freshly prepared at\nsea.\n\n48\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThis carefully prepared standard water sometimes must be used as the reference material for actual sample\nanalysis. If this is planned, the investigator should determine the optical density of the standard water\npreparations before and after a cruise relative to fresh purified water drawn directly into the quartz cuvettes.\nAn assessment of the change in this water over time may indicate a need to use a time-dependent reference\nwater correction.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAs a precaution, even if the investigator intends to have high quality purified water at sea, it is wise to\ndetermine the standard water optical density relative to freshly purified water before a cruise, and as a timeseries to understand the quality of the purified water system used for reference.\n\nSoluble Absorption Sample Preparation, Storage and Analysis\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWash hands with soap and water to avoid contaminating the samples.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUse 0.2 \xc2\xb5m polycarbonate filters (e.g. Nuclepore or equivalent). Do not use irgalan black stained (low\nfluorescence background) polycarbonate filters for this preparation. Other membrane filters, or Sterivex\ncartridges, may also be used, but the investigator must then test for any contamination by the filter and\nensure that no artifacts are introduced.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe filtration system used should be equipped with control of vacuum for each individual filtration funnel\nand with a provision for direct filtration into clean bottles. An example of a suitable soluble absorption\nfiltration assembly is illustrated in Mitchell et al. (2000).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPre-soak each filter for at least 15 min in 10 % HCl. Rinse the filter thoroughly with purified water.\nMount the filter on a filtration funnel and filter ~100 mL of purified water through it into a sample bottle.\nShake the bottle, and discard the water, pouring it over the inside of the cap to rinse it. Cover the filtration\nfunnel with aluminum foil until ready to filter the sample.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCollect ~200 mL of seawater into a clean sample bottle. For the blanks, use purified water drawn directly\nfrom the purification unit into 2 clean sample bottles.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFilter ~75 mL of the samples and 1 blank directly into clean bottles at low vacuum (<120 mm Hg). Do not\nallow filters to go dry during sample rinsing. Shake the bottles, and discard the water.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFilter ~75 mL of the samples into bottles. For the blank, filter ~75 mL of purified water. When finished,\ncap the bottles and store them until they are to be measured in the spectrophotometer.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIf the samples will be measured within 4 hr, store them in the dark at room temperature.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIf the samples will be measured 4 hr to 24 hr later, refrigerate them in the dark.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLonger storage is not recommended, because artifacts of undocumented magnitude are known to occur.\nSeveral researchers have reported results from measurements of frozen samples, but no systematic\nevaluation of possible artifacts resulting from freezing has yet been reported.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWarm refrigerated samples to room temperature before beginning optical density measurements. If it is\npractical to do so, control the samples and the reference water to equal temperatures during the\nspectrophotometric measurements. Absorption by water is strongly temperature dependent at red and near\ninfrared wavelengths (Pegau and Zaneveld 1993).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nQorpak bottles can be re-used at sea. After spectrophotometric analysis is completed, thoroughly rinse\neach bottle and its cap three times with purified water, pour in 20 mL of 10 % HCl acid, and close the cap.\nBefore the bottle is reused, shake it well, discard the 10 % HCl, rinse the bottle and cap copiously with\npurified water, and fill the bottle with purified water, to be used later to rinse a new sample filter. Purified\nwater should be drawn directly from the pure water system.\n\nDetermination of Optical Density of Soluble Absorption Preparations\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIf samples have been refrigerated, allow them to warm to room temperature.\n\n49\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAllow the spectrophotometer to warm up for 30 min. Confirm that the optical windows of the\nspectrophotometer are clean. If necessary, clean them with purified water and ethanol, sequentially, and\ndry them thoroughly with lint-free laboratory tissues.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVerify the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s spectral characteristics and precision as described in Section 4.3.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWash hands with soap and water to avoid contamination\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBetween use, 10 cm quartz window spectrophotometer cuvettes should be stored with purified water. For\nanalysis, discard the purified water in the cuvettes, rinse inside and outside of cuvettes twice with 10 %\nHCl, twice with ethanol, then rinse them inside and outside using copious volumes of purified water. After\nthe cuvettes have been cleaned, use laboratory tissues to handle them. Avoid contacting the cuvettes with\nbare-hands, and do not contaminate their optical windows by touching them.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFill both cuvettes with purified water drawn directly from the water preparation system. Use of purified\nwater stored in containers is not recommended. However, if freshly purified water is not available at sea,\nthe carefully prepared standard water in combusted bottles can be used as a reference, but the investigator\nmust document its degradation over time relative to air (see above).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCarefully dry the cuvettes. Bulk dry with paper towels, but dry the quartz optical windows with lint-free\nlaboratory wipes only (e.g. Kimwipes\xe2\x84\xa2).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInspect cuvettes carefully, especially along their optical paths, to ensure that they are clean. Make sure\nthere are no bubbles, floating dust, or contaminants on the optical windows, or in suspension. Looking\nthrough the cuvette against a black background can usually identify any problems in the samples. Repeat\ncleaning and drying procedures as needed to obtain a clean sample.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRun an air\xe2\x80\x93to-air baseline reference spectrum for the spectrophotometer. Record the digital air baseline.\nThis spectrum should be spectrally flat, with noise less than \xc2\xb1 0.0005 OD .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPlace the reference cuvette in spectrophotometer and scan ODrwa ( \xce\xbb ) , the optical density of purified water\nrelative to air. Remove the reference cuvette and repeat the measurement for the sample cuvette. Store\nboth spectra noting which file is for the cuvette to be used as reference in subsequent analyses, and which is\nto be used for samples. See Figure 4.2 for spectra of ODrwa ( \xce\xbb ) determined during ACE-Asia.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCompare the spectra of ODrwa ( \xce\xbb ) determined for the reference and sample cuvettes to each other, and\nwith a digital library of previous reference water to air optical density spectra. Ensure that the two cuvettes\nare well matched optically, and that both conform to tolerance of pure water relative to air. Note anomalies\nand plan to make any needed corrections during data processing. If anomalies are associated with poor\npreparation of the cuvette, repeat the preparation and run new water-to-air baseline reference scans.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPut both reference and sample cuvettes filled with purified reference water into the spectrophotometer for a\ndouble beam unit. For a single beam unit this will be done sequentially. Run a baseline correction for\npurified water. After the water-to-water baseline optical density measurement is complete, record the pure\nwater baseline as a sample, ODrww ( \xce\xbb ) . This spectrum should be spectrally flat, with magnitude less than\n\xc2\xb1 0.0005 OD . Save the digital baseline spectrum. Ensure the baseline is flat and stable over time and note\nany anomalies. It is common for the baseline to exhibit temperature-dependent artifacts 650-800 nm.\nThese should be minimized if possible by ensuring the purified water in the sample and reference cuvette\nare at the same temperature.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIf the baseline reference spectrum ODrww ( \xce\xbb ) is not flat and stable during analysis according to\nspecifications summarized in section 4.3, the precision of any estimate of soluble absorption may be\nseriously questioned. It is the investigator\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to ensure satisfactory performance of the\ninstruments and use of proper methods to ensure that the final result is reasonable. Significant deviation\nfrom the specifications in section 4.3 or improper consideration of sample preparation protocols may result\nin estimates of soluble absorption that are not meaningful given the small magnitude of this estimate in the\nvisible spectral region of most interest for ocean color applications.\n\n50\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRemove the sample cuvette and discard the liquid. Rinse the inside of the cuvette three times with ~5 mL\nto 10 mL of the next sample to be measured. A copious rinse is desired, but sample volume is often\nlimited. Several vigorously shaken small sample rinses are recommended if the volume is extremely\nlimited.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFill the sample cuvette with the purified water that has been filtered as though it were a sample and record\nthe blank spectrum, OD bs ( \xce\xbb ) , relative to the reference cuvette filled directly from the purified water\nsource..\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRepeat the rinsing for each subsequent sample. The first sample rinse for seawater samples is most\nimportant to eliminate all purified water, especially for seawater samples due to refractive index differences\nbetween fresh and salt water. Fill the cuvette with the next water sample.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPrior to running each sample, dry the exterior of the sample cuvette carefully, and inspect it, as described\nabove, to ensure a clean sample.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReplace the sample cuvette in the spectrophotometer, and measure the ODs ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum relative to\nfreshly purified water. Store the digital data and record all necessary information.\n\n4.6 DATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS\nThe protocols in this section should be followed to compute particle and soluble material absorption coefficients\nfrom the spectrophotometric OD measurements described above. The following discussion assumes that all\nmeasured OD ( \xce\xbb ) spectra, whether for samples, or reference blanks, have been corrected for the instrument baseline\nspectrum, either automatically, or by post-measurement calculations appropriate to a particular spectrophotometer\nconfiguration (see above in Section 4.3, and specific reference spectrum measurement checks in the protocols of\nSections 4.4 and 4.5).\nComputations for absorption coefficients of particles concentrated on filters, and for materials dissolved in\nwater, differ primarily in the determination of optical pathlength and in the treatment of reference blanks.\nSoluble Absorption Coefficients\nFor soluble absorption, the calculations are directly proportional to the sample optical density relative to the\npure water reference after correction for the pure water blank and specification of a null absorption\n2.303\n\xef\xa3\xae[ODs ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 ODbs ( \xce\xbb )] \xe2\x88\x92 ODnull \xef\xa3\xb9 ,\n(4.3)\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nl \xef\xa3\xb0\nwhere l is the cuvette pathlength (usually 0.1 m), OD s ( \xce\xbb ) is the optical density of the filtrate sample relative to\nag ( \xce\xbb ) =\n\npurified water, OD bs ( \xce\xbb ) is optical density of a purified water blank treated like a sample relative to purified water\n(see below), and ODnull is the apparent residual optical density at a long visible or near infrared wavelength where\nabsorption by dissolved materials is assumed to be zero. Note that as long as the null wavelength region is the same\nfor sample and blank, the sample and blank spectra can be set to zero at the null wavelength independently or after\nthey are subtracted from each other, as indicated in Equation (4.3). Equation (4.3) assumes use of a\nspectrophotometer that automatically references the sample and blank optical density to freshly purified water.\nMost modern commercial single or double beam units will compute this optical density directly relative to the\nreference. The user must record both raw sample and blank optical densities relative to purified water, and assess\nthe stability of the purified water OD rww ( \xce\xbb ) reference by routine determinations of the purified water relative to air\n(e.g. ODrwa ( \xce\xbb ) ; Figure 4.2) and also evaluate the sample preparation methods by determining the blanks routinely\n(e.g. daily when at sea; Figure 3B).\n\n51\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\na. Filtered pure water blank spectra\nThere are generally small spectral effects of the filtration and preparation procedure that cause blanks prepared\nfrom purified water to have a higher OD bs ( \xce\xbb ) at short wavelengths compared to the reference cuvette containing\npurified water drawn directly from the purification system. Examples of filtered blank spectra OD bs ( \xce\xbb ) for ACEAsia where Millipore Alpha-Q water was used as the purified water source in the reference cuvette are illustrated in\nFigures 4.3B and 4.3D (c.f. Mitchell et al. 2000). The OD bs ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum should be determined, recorded and\nincluded with the data for each sample. It is recommended that the investigator carefully determine these blanks for\neach station, or at least once per day, during a field program, and evaluate the stability of this blank for quality\ncontrol purposes. If the purified water system is performing well, and the preparation procedures are carefully\nimplemented, the OD bs ( \xce\xbb ) sample blank offsets will generally be very consistent (Figure 4.3B). In such cases, the\nrecommended procedure is to average OD bs ( \xce\xbb ) spectra over the entire cruise, and to then fit a smoothed exponential\nfunction over wavelength to the overall mean (the bold line in Figure 4.3B). A separate ODnull (see discussion\nbelow) should be determined for the averaged and smoothed OD bs ( \xce\xbb ) spectrum before it is substituted in Equation\n(4.3). Because the signals are small, instrument noise is a large fraction of the signal, even for high quality\nspectrophotometers. Therefore subtraction of an individual blank spectrum, including its noise, is strongly\ndiscouraged as this effectively doubles the noise of an already noisy signal. Instead, it is recommended that a\nsmoothed blank be determined from many individual blank spectra provided that the investigator can demonstrate,\nas in Figure 4.3B that there is consistency among the population of blank spectra that are determined. The\nprocedure of determining blanks at least each day during routine sampling provides an important quality control on\nthe sample preparation protocols. If the blank is found to deviate considerably from the norm, the investigator\nshould immediately determine the cause of the discrepancy.\nb. Null point corrections to soluble absorption spectra\nThe absorption spectrum of pure water varies strongly with temperature, especially in the wavelength region\nbetween 650 nm and 750 nm, but at other wavelengths as well (Pegau and Zaneveld, 1993). To avoid temperature\nrelated measurement artifacts, the sample and reference should be maintained at the same temperature, but in\npractice, this is often difficult to do. If strong temperature residuals are apparent in the spectra near 750 nm, one\nmust inspect the data to determine an appropriate wavelength range to use as a null point. For the data in Figure 4.3,\nit appears that assuming a null point as the average from 590-600 nm is reasonable. This assumption may not be\nreasonable in turbid lake, bay and coastal waters, however, where large soluble absorption values may persist into\nthe near IR. Selection of wavelengths for null correction must be evaluated carefully for each data set, following\nprinciples discussed at more length by Mitchell et al. (2000).\nParticle Absorption Coefficients\nTo compute particle absorption a p ( \xce\xbb ) in suspension from spectrophotometric OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) measured with the\nparticles concentrated on a GF/F filter, it is necessary to appropriately adjust the optical pathlength. This includes\nsubstituting the geometric optical pathlength of the particles in suspension, and a scaling factor, \xce\xb2 , accounting for\nthe increase in the optical measurement path by scattering within the filter sample. The geometric absorption\npathlength ls of the filtered material in suspension is given by\nls =\n\nVf\n,\nAf\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere Vf is the volume of water filtered and Af is the clearance area of the filter calculated from the diameter Df of\nthe part of each filter that contains the particles. Df should be determined very carefully on numerous individual\nfilters using AN accurate measurement tool like a caliper that is accurate to at least 0.1 mm.\n\n52\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nScattering of light within the GF/F filter increases the absorption pathlength. The absorption coefficient of\nfiltered particles must be corrected for pathlength amplification and the equivalent absorption coefficient in m-1 in\nsuspension is computed as\nap (\xce\xbb ) =\n\n2.303 A f\n\xef\xa3\xae[OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 OD bf ( \xce\xbb )] \xe2\x88\x92 OD null \xef\xa3\xb9 ,\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\xce\xb2Vf \xef\xa3\xb0\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) is the measured optical density of the sample filter, OD bf ( \xce\xbb ) is the optical density of a fully\nhydrated blank filter, and OD null is a null wavelength residual correction from the infrared where particle\nabsorption is minimal. See also detailed discussion of null point selection in Mitchell et al. (2000)\na. Particle absorption blank spectra\nIf a spectrophotometer with automatic reference baseline correction is used, and the reference filter blank\nbaseline is flat over the spectral range of interest, OD bf ( \xce\xbb ) does not need to be subtracted. Spectra of OD bf ( \xce\xbb )\nmust be determined, recorded and provided with the sample data. Properly prepared blanks generally have flat\nspectra relative to the reference baseline filters. If the OD bf ( \xce\xbb ) is confirmed to be flat, then it is recommended that\nonly a null absorbance is subtracted from the OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) to compensate for baseline offsets. Subtraction of a\nspectrally flat baseline that varies only due to the instrument noise increases the noise of the result. If the instrument\nbaseline cannot be maintained within the recommendations summarized in Section 4.3, the investigator should\nconsider using a different instrument since the errors in the methods caused by using unstable instruments are\ndifficult to control for.\nb. Null point corrections to particle absorption spectra\nTo correct for residual offsets in the sample filter relative to the reference, and for scattering artifacts due to\nparticle loading, it is assumed that a null absorption wavelength in the infrared can be identified. Historically, many\ninvestigators used 750 nm as the null absorption wavelength, but recent reports indicate that this wavelength is too\nshort for some waters. It is recommended that the null wavelength be set at 800 nm (or longer), and that the\ninvestigator must examine the spectra to evaluate residual absorption structure near the null wavelength. Rather\nthan use a single wavelength, a mean OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) in a 10 nm interval (e.g. 790 nm to 800 nm) may be used as the null\nvalue to minimize the introduction of noise in the null correction procedure. Mitchell et al. (2000) discuss, at more\nlength, factors affecting the choice of an appropriate wavelength for estimating OD null . In Case 2 waters, the\ndefinition of the null absorption is more difficult and the investigator may consider the benefits of the transmissionreflectance estimates of particle absorption (Tassan and Ferrari, 1995a).\nc. Pathlength amplification corrections\nTo correct for the pathlength increases due to multiple scattering in the filter, the prevalent current practice is to\nestimate \xce\xb2 empirically through either a quadratic or power function that may be expressed in the form\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\n\xce\xb2 = \xef\xa3\xaeC1 + C2 \xef\xa3\xaeOD fp ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 ODnull ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 \xef\xa3\xb9 ,\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\xef\xa3\xbb\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\n(4.6a)\n\nor\n\xce\xb2 = C0 + C1 \xef\xa3\xaeOD fp ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 ODnull ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\nC2\n\n,\n\n(4.6b)\n\nfor quadratic equation or power function fits, respectively. C0, C1 and C2 are coefficients of least squares regression\nfits of measured data. Recommended coefficients have been reported in the literature (Table 1). The investigator\nshould either choose published coefficients consistent with the species composition, equipment and measurement\nconditions for a given data set (consider the discussion in Mitchell et al. 2000), or independently determine\n\n53\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\npathlength amplification factors by comparing absorption in suspension and on filters following procedures\ndescribed previously (Mitchell 1990, Mitchell et al., 2000).\nd. De-pigmented Particle and Phytoplankton Absorption Coefficients\nThe de-pigmented particle absorption coefficients, ad ( \xce\xbb ) , may be calculated using Equation (4.5), by\nsubstituting. OD fd ( \xce\xbb ) for OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) . At present it is recommended to use the same pathlength correction factor for\nthe de-pigmented samples as for the particle absorption sample. The validity of this operational choice of \xce\xb2 is\ndifficult to assess, because the de-pigmented particles are created operationally from the treatment, and the\nrelationships between their absorption on filters compared to suspensions may differ from those derived empirically\nfor the original particles.\nThe spectral absorption coefficient for phytoplankton pigments can be computed as the difference between\nparticulate and de-pigmented estimates:\na\xcf\x86 ( \xce\xbb ) = a p ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 ad ( \xce\xbb ) .\n\n(4.7)\n\n4.7 DATA REPORTING\nFor purposes of data reporting and archiving, the absorption coefficients will be reported in m\xe2\x80\x931 and computed\nusing the equations summarized above. Uncorrected optical density spectra for the filter samples, blank filter\nreferenced to a blank filter, pure water referenced to air, pure water referenced to pure water and soluble absorption\nblank spectra must be recorded and provided so alternative algorithms could be applied to the original data. The\npathlength amplification factor, a description of (or reference to) the method and the procedure for assignment of the\nnull absorption, and any blank or spectral scattering corrections for the soluble absorption calculations must be\nreported.\n\n4.9 PROTOCOL STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nAbsorption spectra for particles filtered on GF/F filters\nDetails of various issues related to this frequently used method for estimating particle absorption for filtered\nsamples are not significantly changed since the summary of the NASA-sponsored Workshops found in Mitchell et\nal. (2000). It is important to address a few salient issues that are routinely asked by investigators interested in\nimplementing the method. First, most modern dual-beam spectrophotometers that have a grating before the sample\nand illuminate the sample with spectrally resolved light have negligible differences (a few percent) in terms of\ndetermining the raw GF/F filter OD fp ( \xce\xbb ) of the particles relative to a properly hydrated blank filter if the protocols\nare carefully followed. Thus, it is not essential to determine the pathlength amplification factor, \xce\xb2 , for each different\nspectrophotometer that is used as long as the investigator makes an appropriate choice of instrumentation.\nHowever, some spectrophotometers have limited spectral range, limited dynamic range, more noise and inferior\nstability so the investigator should evaluate the unit to be used to ensure suitability by following the\nrecommendations in section 4.3. Second, diode-array systems that illuminate with broad-band light and then\ndisperse the post-sample light using a spectral photodiode array may have significantly different raw OD for the\nfiltered sample. Example OD spectra estimated for a diatom culture for various systems used at the Scripps\nWorkshop are shown in Figure 4.1 (see also details in Mitchell et al. 2000). Note the Hewlett-Packard spectral\ndiode array system has a significantly higher OD than the other instruments. An empirical relation for this offset in\nthe range 400-700 nm is reported in Mitchell et al. (2000) for that specific model. The Hewlett-Packard data is\nreported only for wavelengths greater than 400 nm because the instrument performs poorly at short wavelengths\nwith the glass fiber filter method. If a user chooses such optical geometry for the determination of particle\nabsorption they should carefully assess the potential issues illustrated in Figure 4.1. We recommend that the user\ncompare several spectrophotometers for raw optical density of properly hydrated samples relative to blank filters\nand ensure the unit they use does not deviate from the typical result of most systems for which amplifications factors\n(\xce\xb2) have been determined (Table 4.1). Alternatively one must determine the pathlength amplification for the\n\n54\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\ninstrument of choice, a laborious and unnecessary procedure if a spectrophotometer is selected that does not cause\nthe bias illustrated in Figure 4.1.\nAbsorption spectra for particles transferred to glass slides\nAn alternative method, developed by Allali et al. (1995), to estimate absorption coefficients of cultures and\nseawater samples is to freeze transfer the particles to transparent microscope slides, following the protocols of\nHewes and Holm-Hansen (1983). The investigator must have an integrating sphere or equivalent scattered\ntransmission accessory to implement this method. This procedure produced results comparable to the GF/F filter\nmethod in comparisons reported by Mitchell et al. (2000), but sufficient uncertainties remain that the GF/F method\ncontinues to be recommended for the present.\nTransmission-Reflectance (T-R) Method\nTassan and Ferrari (1995a) described a modification of the light-transmission method that corrects for\nbackscattering. This technique combines light-transmission (T) and light-reflection (R) measurements, carried out\nusing an integrating sphere attached to a dual-beam spectrophotometer. The data analysis is performed by a\ntheoretical model that eliminates the effect of light backscattering by the particles. At the Scripps workshop, the\nglobal error of the T-R method was comparable to the error yielded by the simpler T method for monocultures.\nSubsequent modifications of the T-R experimental routine (Tassan and Ferrari, 1998; Ferrari and Tassan, 1999)\nyielded a significant reduction of the experimental error. Tassan and Ferrari (1995) reported that for case 1 waters\nthat have negligible inorganic particle load, the amplification factor for GF/F filters determined with the T-R\nmethods is similar to those determined by Mitchell (1990). The T-R method is particularly suited for applications to\nsamples containing highly scattering mineral particles that are commonly found in Case 2 waters. Despite the more\ncomplicated procedure including an instrument with an integrating sphere, this method should be considered in\nspecial circumstances, and with further development may eventually supercede the presently recommended\ntransmission protocol.\nAbsorption spectra for seawater filtered through membrane filters or cartridges\nFor most ocean regions, the optical density of dissolved organic material, relative to purified water in a typical\n10 cm pathlength cuvette, is very small in the 400-600 nm region of most interest to ocean color satellite\ninvestigations. To ensure a common frame of reference for the global data collected by diverse investigators, we\nrecommend ODrwa ( \xce\xbb ) spectra (250-850 nm) be determined relative to air for purified water directly introduced to\nproperly cleaned quartz cuvettes. The purpose of such spectra is to obtain an independent reference of the quality of\nthe purified water. ODrwa ( \xce\xbb ) spectra for the sample cuvette used during ACE-Asia are shown in Figure 4.2.\nODrwa ( \xce\xbb ) should be determined daily for the sample and reference cuvettes used in analyses. The investigator\n\nshould keep careful records of this data and assess any bias in final estimates that may be attributed to problems with\nthe reference water. By plotting in the range of minimal absorption by water (250-600 nm; Figure 4.2A) one can\nassess whether or not the reference water on a ship has seriously degraded. Production of impure water by\ncommercial systems is a relatively common problem on ships where the feed water may have serious contamination.\nIf the purified water system fails at sea, the investigator should use the standard water prepared prior to the cruise as\nthe reference. Spectra of ODrwa ( \xce\xbb ) of the bottled standard water should be determined before and after a cruise for\neach lot of bottled standards that are prepared. This precaution is important to assist in any corrections that might be\nrequired if standard water is used as a reference, or if the purified water system degrades over time during a cruise.\nThere are still relatively few spectra of soluble absorption determined fresh at sea using the revised protocols\nrecommended here. Spectra of ODs ( \xce\xbb ) and OD bs ( \xce\xbb ) collected during ACE-Asia are shown in Figure 4.3. Raw\noptical density, relative to Millipore Alpha-Q water are shown in 3A. We routinely find small positive offsets from\n600-800 nm that we feel should be compensated by subtracting a null value. Figure 4.3B illustrates OD bs ( \xce\xbb ) during\nACE-Asia prepared as recommended in section 4.5, but plotted at 10x smaller scale as Figure 4.3A. The\nrecommended procedure is to subtract a cruise (or global) mean of this blank (solid line in Figure 4.3B) from the\nraw sample OD values, and then to adjust this difference to zero at a null reference [Equation (4.3)]. The smoothed\n\n55\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nglobal blank was determined by taking the mean of all blanks for each cruise we have completed since 1998,\nsubsequently taking the mean of all cruises and lastly fitting an exponential function to the global mean after setting\na null point as the average from 590-600 nm. There can be small differences in blank spectra cruise to cruise, but\nwe do not find this to be significant relative to the overall statistics of all cruises or the variance within a single\ncruse. For relatively weakly absorbing samples like open oceans observed during ACE-Asia, there is negligible\napparent absorption > 600 nm and there is clear evidence in 3A of uncompensated temperature effects 650-800 nm.\nTherefore we chose to set the null value as the mean from 590-600 nm. However, if very strong soluble absorption\nis present, the temperature effects 650-800 nm will be less significant, and the absorption 590-600 nm may be\nimportant. The investigator should evaluate their data to determine the best null point and report that assessment.\nFigure 4.3C are optical density of spectra for a 10 cm cuvette after correcting for the null value and the blank\nspectrum The effort to carefully determine the purified water relative to air, and blanks during each cruise will\nallow different investigators to inter-compare their results better, and will ensure better quality control of data\ncollected over time. We have also determined the time-dependent change of our standard water (data not shown),\nand when we use that as a reference due to the failure of our purified water system at sea, we subtract a different\nblank than the global fit shown in Figure 4.3B.\nAn alternate method for preparing samples for soluble absorption allows multiple use of Sterivex sealed\nfiltration cartridges. Use of these cartridges has been described by D\xe2\x80\x99Sa et al. (1999) who used the method to\nprepare samples delivered to a capillary light guide spectrophotometer for estimating absorption by soluble material.\nThe procedure provides high sensitivity and can be adapted to continuous flow determinations. This new method\nmay prove useful in various applications but has not been applied extensively at this time. Evaluation of the\nperformance of the Sterivex cartridges for sample preparation, and of light guides for spectroscopy, warrant further\nresearch.\nConstraints on the estimate of soluble and particle absorption\nTo constrain our water sample estimates of particle and soluble absorption we have compared them to spectral\nestimates of the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance, K d ( z , \xce\xbb ) , determined using a free-fall\nradiometer during a Southern Ocean cruise (AMLR) and a western Pacific Ocean cruise (ACE-Asia). It is well\nknown that accurate estimate of K d ( z , \xce\xbb ) in the upper ocean is difficult. Problems include heave of the ship, foam,\nbubbles, shadow, tilt, sky conditions and other influences on this apparent optical property (see more detailed\ndiscussions in other chapters of these protocols). Waters et al. (1990) described advantages of free-fall systems and\nmany investigators have adopted this procedure to minimize some of the problems cited above. In 2001 we\ndeployed our Biospherical Instruments PRR 800 system at approximately 80 stations combined between our AMLR\nand ACE-Asia cruises. We consider this our highest quality radiometric data set because of the free-fall\ndeployment, the spectral range from 312-710 nm and because we acquired 4-5 separate free-fall profiles at each\nstation to improve the confidence in our final estimate. In Figure 4.4 we show estimates of the mean cosine for\nspectral downwelling irradiance, \xc2\xb5 d ( \xce\xbb ) , of the upper ocean mixed layer (open symbols). Here we define \xc2\xb5 d ( \xce\xbb ) as\nthe ratio [aw ( \xce\xbb ) + ap ( \xce\xbb ) + ag ( \xce\xbb )] / K d . For Figure 4.4, values for pure water are estimated from Pope and Fry\n(1997) for 380-700 nm, Quickenden and Irvin (1980) for 300-320 and a linear interpolation between those values for\n320-380 nm as recommended by Fry (2000). If the individual components are accurate, this can be considered a\nreasonable estimate of the mean cosine near the ocean surface (see Mobley, 1994 for detailed discussion of the mean\ncosine). Theoretically the values of \xc2\xb5 d ( \xce\xbb ) should be less than 1.0 and for typical radiance distributions of the upper\nocean, they should be in the range of 0.70-0.85 near the surface. For both AMLR and ACE-Asia all absorption data\nwere determined fresh at sea with consistent methods between the two cruises. We found that in the region 500 nm\nto 650 nm there is little difference between the estimates of \xc2\xb5 d ( \xce\xbb ) for the Southern Ocean and the western Pacific.\nHowever, below 500 nm, the values for ACE-Asia are near 1.0 and below 400 nm they exceed 1.0. For AMLR,\nvalues approach 1.0 for wavelengths less than 350 nm.\nThe ratio of ag ( \xce\xbb ) / at ( \xce\xbb ) where at = aw + ap + ag , is also plotted in Figure 4.4 (filled symbols).\n\nThe trend\n\nclearly illustrates that the soluble component dominates at short wavelength. There are several hypotheses that\nshould be considered to understand the overestimates of \xc2\xb5 d ( \xce\xbb ) below 400 nm. These could include underestimate\nof K d ( z , \xce\xbb ) or overestimates of any of the absorption components. A combination of these factors may prevail.\n\n56\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nThe filter radiometer in the profiler has good out of band blocking, but the spectrum of surface irradiance is rapidly\nchanging in the region <350 nm and this may cause a red shift in the effective band center of the channels, with an\nassociated underestimate of K d ( z , \xce\xbb ) . There may be small particles or colloids that pass the 0.2 \xc2\xb5m filters causing\na spectrally dependent scattering error (Aas, 2000). The particle absorption we estimate is based on Mitchell (1990),\nwhich results in higher estimates compared to some other published methods (Table 1). Also, there has not been\nadequate attention paid to determination of the pathlength amplification factor for the region below 400 nm. It is\nalso possible that the values for pure water absorption are too high. The very reasonable or slightly high (by about\n10-15%) values for the mean cosine of downwelling irradiance shown in Figure 4.4 for 400-600 nm indicates that\nthe absorption methods recommended here are rather robust compared to simple estimates of diffuse attenuation\ncoefficients. Reynolds et al. (2001) and Stramska et al. (2000) have reported reasonable closure between estimates\nof absorption using these methods, radiometric observations and modeling.\nWe have used \xe2\x80\x9cpure water\xe2\x80\x9d absorption for our estimate of aw ( \xce\xbb ) , and salts should in fact be added, if\nimportant, in the comparison of absorption to diffuse attenuation in Figure 4.4. Our estimate of ag ( \xce\xbb ) relative to\npurified water will include absorption by salts, if they are significant. Salts in seawater are significant absorbers at\nshort wavelengths. Lenoble (1956; see also Shiffrin, 1988) reported values for pure salts dissolved in purified water\nthat indicate absorption coefficients near 300 nm comparable to the sample optical density of filtered samples\nrelative to purified water that we routinely determine at sea in this spectral region. This UV absorption (<320 nm),\nrelative to purified water, is generally assumed to be caused by \xe2\x80\x9ccolored dissolved organic matter\xe2\x80\x9d but this may be\ninaccurate at these short wavelengths. Therefore one must be very cautious interpreting the apparent optical density\nof seawater filtrates relative to purified water for wavelengths less than 320nm. We recommend that more careful\nresearch should be carried out on the methods for soluble absorption, which appears to have a potentially\ndominating influence on the overestimates of \xc2\xb5 d ( \xce\xbb ) less than 400 nm. In particular, the influence of scattering by\nsmall particles (organic or mineral) and the role of salt absorption must be more carefully assessed.\n\nREFERENCES\nAas, E., 2000: Spectral slope of yellow substance: problems caused by small particles.

In particular, the volume scattering coefficient b ( \xce\xbb ) and volume backscattering coefficient\nbb ( \xce\xbb ) may be derived by integrating \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) over the unit sphere and backward hemisphere, respectively. In\n\nterms of determining the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete\xe2\x80\x9d IOP from in situ measurements, a useful combination is a ( \xce\xbb ) , the beam\nattenuation coefficient c ( \xce\xbb ) , and the volume scattering phase function \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) =\n\n\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 )\n\nc (\xce\xbb) \xe2\x88\x92 a (\xce\xbb)\n\n. The reader is\n\nreferred to Vol. I, Chapter 2 (Sect. 2.4) and to Chapter 1 of the present volume for further details regarding these\ndefinitions and relationships.\nKnowledge of the VSF is a critical prerequisite to accurate radiative transfer modeling of remote sensing\nreflectance and water-leaving radiance. In Vol. III, Chapter 4 (and references cited there), it is shown that irradiance\nreflectance R ( \xce\xbb ) is approximately proportional to the ratio of the backscattering to absorption coefficients, and that\nupwelled radiance just beneath the sea surface is proportional to R ( \xce\xbb ) , so that\nLu ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86 ) = Ed ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb )\n\nf bb ( \xce\xbb )\n.\nQ a (\xce\xbb)\n\nThis relationship is completely general and exact, but it does not express a linear proportionality to the IOP ratio,\nbecause the factors f and Q are not simply coefficients. .They are functions, f \xef\xa3\xae \xce\xbb, ( \xce\xb8 o , \xcf\x84 a ,W ) , a ( \xce\xbb ) , \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xa8 ) \xef\xa3\xb9 and\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nQ \xef\xa3\xae( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8\xe2\x80\xb2, \xcf\x86 ) , ( \xce\xb8 o , \xcf\x84 a , W ) , a ( \xce\xbb ) , \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xa8 ) \xef\xa3\xb9 , that account for the bidirectional nature of the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s reflectance; this\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\nbidirectionality may be traced directly to the shape of the VSF. Bidirectionality of remote sensing reflectance, as it\narises from the VSF, is shown more explicitly in the formulation by Zaneveld (1982).\nEquation (1.18) could be used directly as a basis for measuring the VSF if an instrument\xe2\x80\x99s source and detector\nwere well collimated, and there were no flux losses, or FOV distortions, associated with an its optical elements.\nSome general angle scattering meters (Petzold 1972; Lee et al. 2003) are designed with a well-enough collimated\nbeam and very small detector acceptance angle, so that equation (1.18) may be applied directly. In terms of\nequation (1.19), this is equivalent to assuming that the scattering response weighting function W ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95; c ) is\nnarrow enough to set it to unity. The General Angle Scattering Meter (GASM), built at the Scripps Institution of\nOceanography\xe2\x80\x99s Visibility Laboratory (Petzold 1972), consists of a lamp focused into a cylindrical beam, and a\nnarrow field of view detector mounted to swing in an arc to view the beam at many off-axis scattering angles\nbetween approximately 10o and 170o. Petzold (1972) reported VSF\xe2\x80\x99s measured for selected natural waters using the\n\n65\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\n(GASM). This reference has been widely used to describe shapes of \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) in natural waters. Mobley et al. (2001)\ncompared measured and modeled nadir-viewing remote sensing reflectances, using measured c ( \xce\xbb ) and a ( \xce\xbb ) with\n\xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) of different assumed shapes, including that of Petzold (1972), and the VSF measured using a general angle\n\nscattering meter of a new design (Lee et al., 2003); best agreement was achieved using the measured VSF. Their\nresults showed that large systematic offsets can result if one arbitrarily assumes a scattering phase function having\nan incorrect backward scattering fraction. The results of Mobley et al. (2001) also indicated that nadir-viewing\nradiance reflectance is less sensitive to the detailed shape of the forward scattering lobe of \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) . Details of\nscattering at intermediate forward angles might, however, be more important for off-nadir viewing geometry (Vol.\nIII, Ch. 4).\nAt present, commercially available VSF sensors12 are designed with detector beam-spread and detector\nacceptance angles ranging from 10o to 20o Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM). These instruments measure the\nVSF, weighted as in (1.19), at one (or a few) scattering angle(s) and are typically used to determine the\nbackscattering coefficient using the methods described below in Sect. 5.4. Although these methods depend on\nassumptions concerning \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) , determinations of bb ( \xce\xbb ) from VSF profile measurements with these instruments,\nwhen combined with absorption and beam attenuation coefficients, radiometric profiles and pigment concentration\nmeasurements, have provide useful information about relationships between IOP, AOP and optically important\nmaterial constituents of the water column (e.g. Stramska et al. 2000).\n\nFig. 5.1: Schematic illustration of a VSF sensor geometry used for numerical integration over\nthe volume intersected by a source beam and detector FOV of incremental elements of the\nscattered radiant flux received by the detector.\n\n12\n\nCertain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this chapter to foster understanding.\nSuch identification does not imply recommendation, or endorsement, by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the\npurpose.\n66\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\nAn example of a generalized source and detector arrangement to measure the VSF \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) at a scattering angle\n\xcf\x80\nis illustrated schematically in Fig. 5.1. To determine a calibration factor relating the detector response to\n2\nflux scattered from the source beam into the field of view (FOV) of the detector, we must determine the sensor\xe2\x80\x99s\nresponse weighting function W ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95; c ) [equation (1.19)], either explicitly, or implicitly. The explicit approach\n\xcf\x88>\n\nto this problem is to determine W ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88, \xcf\x95; c ) from geometry and first principles, and then calibrate the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s\nresponse signals in a medium having a known VSF \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) ; the detailed steps in this approach are described below\nin Sect. 5.2. The implicit approach (Maffione and Dana 1997) is to insert a plaque of known near-Lambertian\nreflectance in the position of the horizontal xy-plane, at distance z from the source-detector axis, illustrated Fig. 5.1,\nand record the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s responses as the plaque is moved vertically in small increments through the volume\ndefined by the intersection of the source beam and detector FOV; this approach is briefly outlined in Sect. 5.3\nbelow, but the reader is referred to Maffione and Dana (1997) for the detailed derivation and method of\nimplementation.\nFor brevity, we will henceforth omit the explicit wavelength dependence of variables.\n\n5.2 CHARACTERIZATION AND CALIBRATION OF A VSF SENSOR\nFROM ITS GEOMETRY AND RESPONSE TO SCATTERING BY\nPOLYSTYRENE BEADS\nGeometric Determination of W(\xcf\x88)\nFigure 5.1 illustrates a source located at the origin xo = (0, 0, 0) and a detector located on the y-axis at position\nxd = (0, y d , 0) .

At a distance z above the xy plane, a horizontal plane is shown passing through the the\nsource beam (a nearly transparent, light-shaded ellipse) and detector FOV (a dark shaded ellipse); the intersection of\nthe source beam and detector FOV is the intermediate gray-shaded area.

The instrument is then rotated in\n\xcb\x86\nincrements about \xce\xb5 d and the process is repeated to map the distribution of responses in a sequence of planes\nadequate to resolve the full function hd \xef\xa3\xae\xce\xb5 \xe2\x88\x88 \xe2\x84\xa6d \xef\xa3\xb9 . This is essentially the same procedure used to characterize the\n\xef\xa3\xb0\xcb\x86\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nangular FOV of field radiometers (Vol. II, Ch. 3).\nThe inverse of the above setup may be used to map the flux distribution of the source beam. The instrument is\nmounted with the source aligned with the optical and rotation axes, and a narrow FOV detector is substituted for the\ncollimated source. The stage is rotated through a suitable angular range to map out flux variations in a plane\n\xcb\x86\n\xcb\x86\nthrough \xce\xb5 o , and the instrument is rotated about \xce\xb5 o and the process repeated to measure flux distributions in a\nsequence of planes. If the temporal stability of flux output by the source is in question, a second detector may be\n\xcb\x86\nmounted to monitor the source output from a fixed off-axis direction relative to \xce\xb5 o , i.e. by mounting it on an\nextension to the rotational stage.\nWhether one must go to the trouble to determine the beam and FOV weighting functions more accurately than\ncan be modeled from simple geometric elements of the optical design depends on the shape of the VSF in the region\nto be measured. The detailed behaviour of the outer edges of the two distribution functions are not important factors\nin determing the weighting functions for measurements of the VSF of pure water, or of a particulate VSF at\nscattering angles near, or greater than, 90o (Figs. 1.2 and 1.3). Therefore, relatively simple approximations to\nho \xef\xa3\xae\xce\xb5 \xe2\x88\x88 \xe2\x84\xa6o \xef\xa3\xb9 and hd \xef\xa3\xae\xce\xb5 \xe2\x88\x88 \xe2\x84\xa6d \xef\xa3\xb9 should be completely adequate for the commercial backscattering instruments\n\xef\xa3\xb0\xcb\x86\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\xef\xa3\xb0\xcb\x86\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nmentioned above. Conversely, the angular breadth and details of the beam and FOV distribution functions both\nbecome increasingly more critical when one wishes to measure the VSF at decreasing angles in the forward\ndirection.\nDependence of the Weighting Functions on the Beam Attenuation Coefficient c\nThe effect of the beam attenuation coefficient on the weighting function W ( x; c ) for each volume element is\nexplicitly represented in (5.7) by the transmittance over the combined pathlength from the source to the volume\nelement at x and from there to the source location. The transmittance term is integrated into each angular\nweighting function W ( \xcf\x88; c ) determined using (5.8). Strictly speaking, near-forward scattered light still enters\n\xe2\x88\x86V ( x ) and can be scattered to the detector (see also the discussion of transmissometer acceptance angles in\n\nChapter 2), but we will neglect this complication in the present discussion. The ratios of integrated weighting\n\xe2\x88\xab W ( \xcf\x88; c ) sin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88 are compared against increasing beam attenuation coefficient c for the three ECOfunctions\n\xe2\x88\xab W ( \xcf\x88; c = 0 ) sin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88\nVSF weighting functions illustrated in Fig. 5.2. These functions are clearly log-linear, and should we choose to\nrepresent the weighting function exclusively using W ( \xcf\x88; c = 0 ) , it would be a simple matter to adjust the results for\nc dependence.\n\nThis dependence may either be applied as a correction to the weighting function, or by a\n\n70\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume IV\n\ntransmittance function of the form \xce\xb2p ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88; c ) = \xce\xb2p ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) exp \xef\xa3\xae creff ( \xcf\x88 ) \xef\xa3\xb9 , where \xce\xb2p ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x88 ) is the measured VSF\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\nusing W ( \xcf\x88; c = 0 ) (see below) and reff ( \xcf\x88 ) is an effective net pathlength for the particular scattering angle\n\nmeasurement.\n\nFig. 5.3: Dependence of the integrated weighting functions\n\n\xe2\x88\xab W ( \xcf\x88; c ) sin \xcf\x88d \xcf\x88\n\non the\n\nbeam attenuation coefficient for the 3 ECO-VSF weighting functions of Fig. 5.2.\nCalibration with Polystyrene Spheres\nIn this approach, a sample of polystyrene microsphere beads must be obtained and prepared for use in the\ncalibration procedure.
