Such applications\nusually require an array of discrete photo-responsive\nelements to be positioned at the focal plane of an optical 25\ninstrument. Current efforts towards producing higher\nresolution images has created a demand for a focal plane\nwith a greater number of photo-responsive elements\nbecause the degree of resolution obtainable is proportional to the number of elements in the array. By way of 30\nillustration, one array under consideration has between\none and ten thousand elements arranged in a linear\narray. The demand for higher resolution can be met\nonly by such expedients as reducing the size of the\nphoto-responsive elements because optical consider- 35\nations tend to limit the area of focal planes.\nTo derive intelligible image data from the stream of\nsignals generated by focal plane array at least two leads\nmust be used to individually interconnect each photoresponsive element to its own preamplifier or other 40\nsignal processing step. Typically, the elements in a focal\nplane array are made with pairs of discrete metal\ncontacts. A pair of fine gold wires serves as interconnecting leads between each pair of contacts and a corresponding signal processing stage. The presence of the 45\ncontacts and interconnecting leads places an upper limit\nupon the extent of size reduction achievable with available photo-responsive elements.\nThe sheer number of interconnecting leads itself presents a serious fabrication and reliability problem which 50\nmay be exacerbated if the focal plane area must also\naccommodate cryogenic cooling equipment for the\nphoto-responsive elements. Although available monolithic extrinsic silicon infrared detectors and charge\ncoupled devices eliminate the necessity for intercon- 55\nnecting wires, such devices are not suitable for remote\nsensing of objects illuminated by reflected sunlight because available extrinsic silicon is not responsive to\ninfrared radiation between 1.65 pm and 2.3 pm, and,\ntherefore, is responsive to only part of the spectrum 60\nwithin one of the atmospheric windows. .\n\nIt is yet another object to provide an improved interconnection between a photo-responsive element and a\nmetal oxide semiconductor circuit.\nIt is a further object to provide a compact integrated\nphoto-responsive element and metal oxide semiconductor circuit.\nIt is also an object to provide a photo-responsive\ndevice free of wire lead interconnections between its\nphotodetector element and its preamplifier stage.\nThese and other objects are achieved by a device\nhaving a layer of a lead chalcogenide material forming\na photo-responsive element monolithically integrated\ninto a metal oxide semiconductor circuit for processing\nthe signal stream generated by the element. The photoresponsive element is deposited upon an oxide layer of\nthe semiconductor with opposite sides of the layer partially covering and forming ohmic contacts with ends of\nthe two strips of metallization serving as electrodes of\nthe signal processing circuit. Exposure of the element to\nincident radiation effects a variation in electrical characteristics of the element, thereby causing a responsive\nchange in the signal stream provided to the processing\ncircuit via the metallization electrodes.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION O F THE DRAWINGS\nA more complete appreciation of this invention, and\n\nmany of the attendant advantages thereof, will be\nreadily apparent as the same becomes better understood\nby reference to the following detailed description when\nconsidered in conjunction with the accompanying\ndrawings in which like numbers indicate the same or\nsimilar components, wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a top view showing an embodiment of the\npresent invention.\nFIG. 2 is a schematic representation of the electrical\ncircuit shown in FIG. 1.\nFIGS. 3a through 3h are cross-sectional views taken\nalong line 111-111 of FIG. 5 showing-anactive component of the embodiment of FIG. 5 at various steps of\nfabrication.\nFIGS. 4a througuh 4c are cross-sectional views taken\nalong lines IV-IV of FIG. 5 showing a photo-responsive element of the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 3 at\nvarious steps of fabrication.\nFIG. 5 is a top view showing the embodiment of\nFIG. 1in a monolithically integrated circuit.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE\nINVENTION\nRefer now to the drawings and, in particular, to FIG.\n1 which illustrates a partially completed monolithic\ndevice 10 fabricated on a semiconductor substrate to\nembody the present invention. The device includes an\nelectronic circuit having a metal oxide semiconductor\nactive component integrally interconnected to a photoresponsive element. The active component includes a\nfield effect transistor TI having three adjoining electrodes with two electrodes, i.e., a source S and drain D,\nsymmetricallyarranged on opposite sides of the third, a\ngate G. Etched strips 20,22,24,26,28and 30 formed of\na layer of metallization, interconnect the various circuit\ncomponents with the active component. One exemplary\nSTATEMENT O F THE INVENTION\ncircuit configuration of the device 10 includes a transistor TI in a source follower configuration 12 schematiAccordingly, it i s one object of the present invention\n65 cally represented in FIG. 2. Such a configuration will\nto provide an improved photo-responsive element.\nprovide a preamplifier stage for the data stream from\nIt is another object to provide a photo-responsive\nthe photo-responsive element. The substrate is electrielement monolithically integrated into a metal oxide\ncally shorted to the drain region metallization by such\nsemiconductor circuit.\n\n3\n\n4,709,252\n\ntechniques as soldering the substrate to an encapsulating\ncase electrically coupled to the drain metallization.\nCircuit resistances Ro, RL and Rs are formed by disCrete islands of lower conducting resistive material\nbridging various pairs of the metallization strips. This 5\nresistive material, a lead chalcogenide, is photo-responsive. One of the islands, RD, is used in the circuit as the\nphoto-responsive element.\nMetallization strip 20 has one end making electrical\ncontact with the source region and its other end form- 10\ning a terminal pad 32 to which external electrical leads\nmay be connected. Metallization strip 22 has one end\nelectrically contacting the drain region and its other end\nforming a terminal pad 34. An intermediate segment of\nmetallization strip 22 is in ohmic contact with and cov- 15\nered by one side of the layer of material forming resistance Rs. One end of metallization strip 24 is in ohmic\ncontact with and partially covered by the other side of\nresistance Rs while the other end of strip 24 forms a\nterminal pad 36. Metallization strip 26 has three ends: 20\none end overlying and providing p-channel enhancement of the gate region, another end in ohmic contact\nwith and partially covered by one side of the layer of\nmaterial forming resistance RL, and its third end forming a terminal pad 38. An intermediate segment of strip 25\n26 is in ohmic contact with and covered by the layer of\nphoto-resistive material forming the photo-responsive\nelement Ro. Metallization strip 26 effectively forms a\nnode with resistance RL and photo-responsive element\nRo serving as a voltage divider at the gate electrode. 30\nMetallization strip 28 has one end forming a terminal\npad 40 and its other end in ohmic contact with and\ncovered by the other side of element Ro. Metallization\nstrip 30 has one end in ohmic contact with and covered\nby the side of resistance RL opposite strip 26; the other 35\nend of strip 30 forms a terminal pad 42.\nThe structure of device 10 is fabricated on a wafer 50\nof an electronic grade semiconducting material such as\n<111> silico<n,shown in FIG. 3a, with three to five\nohms per centimeter resistivity. The wafer is lightly 40\ndoped with phosphorus to exhibit an n-type conductivity. An insulating field layer of silicon dioxide 52,\nshown in FIG. 3b, is formed on one surface 51 by passing steam and oxygen over the surface while the wafer\nis maintained at a temperature of approximately 1,ooo" 45\nC. The silicon dioxide layer is coated with negative\nphotoresist and a mask with images defining a pair of\nspaced windows 54, 56 is exposed against the silicon\ndioxide layer. The photoresist is developed, exposing\nthe silicon dioxide insulating layer in the areas of win- 50\ndows 54, 56, to a low temperature post-bake to harden\nthe photo-resist. The silicon dioxide within the window\nareas is removed by immersing the wafer into a buffered\nhydrofluoric acid etchant solution. The photo-resist is\nstripped in hot chromic acid and the wafers are rinsed 55\nclean. The wafer is then doped by thermal diffusion\nthrough windows 54 and 56 to create p-type conductivity source, S, and drain, D, regions extending downward from the surface 51 as shown in FIG. 3c.\nThe silicon dioxide insulating layer 52 is removed and 60\nthe surface rinsed clean, as shown in FIG. 3d. Another\nlayer of silicon dioxide 58, shown in FIG. 3e, is then\ndeposited to a controlled thickness by again subjecting\nthe surface to thermal oxidization. Windows 60, 62 are\nphotolithographically etched into the silicon dioxide 65\nlayer 58 in the same manner as windows 54, 56, as\nshown in FIG. 3 to partially expose the source and\nf\ndrain regions. The etching process leaves an insulating\n\n4\n\nstrip 64 of silicon dioxide completely covering the gate\nregion and parts of the adjoining source and drain regions.\nAfter the wafer shown in FIG. 3 is rinsed and dried,\nf\na chromium-gold sandwich of metallization is deposited\non the wafer. As shown in FIG. 3g, a thin layer of\nchromium 70 is initially deposited upon a surface 72 of\nthe silicon oxide layer and the exposed surface areas of\nthe source and drain regions to a depth of about one\nhundred angstrom units. Then, a layer of gold 74 is\ndeposited over the chromium layer 90 to a depth of\nabout four thousand angstrom units. The metallization\nis etched in two steps to define the discrete metallizations strips 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30. The gold layer is\nphotolithographically etched\'with potassium iodide in\nthe first step. In the second step, the chromium layer is\nphotolithographically etched with a mixture of glycerine and hydrochloric acid. Subsequent to completion of\nboth etching steps, metallization strips 20,22 and 24 are\nelectrically isolated by gaps 76, 78 which are etched\nthrough the metallization to the surface of the gate\nsilicon dioxide layer.\nMetallization strips 20,22 extend across the windows\n60, 62 in the silicon dioxide layer 58 and form ohmic\ncontacts with the surfaces of the source and drain regions, respectively, exposed by the windows.\nThe chromium-gold metallization strips provide an\nelectrode structure that is chemically and electrically\ncompatible with both the metal oxide semiconductor\nactive component T1 and with the lead chalicogenide\nphoto-responsive element Ro, thereby avoiding the\nneed for wire leads to interconnect the active component and the photo-responsive element. After completion of photolithographic delineation of the metallization of the wafer, shown in FIG. k, the photo-responsive element R o and the circuit resistances RL, Rs are\nadded to the circuit in a chemical deposition process.\nThe base surface 80 of the wafer is mounted on a clean,\ndry glass slide with an adhesive (e.g., Crystal Bond 509)\nimpervious to attack by highly alkaline solutions. A\nliquid lead thiourea complex formation is decomposed\nby a base catalyzed reaction to make a deposition solution. Immediately prior to immersion in the deposition\nsolution, a thickness of thirty to fifty angstrom units of\nthe exposed silicon oxide layer 58 is removed by immersion of the wafer for a few seconds in a solution of three\nparts water and one part concentrated hydrofluoric\nacid, thereby cleaning the gold metallization while preparing a fresh silicon dioxide surface for nucleation\nwithout damaging the active component structure. The\nslide mounted wafer is then held immersed in the deposition solution until a first coat of a mirror-like film of\nlead sulfide is deposited upon all surfaces (the metallization strips and the surfaces 72 of the silicon dioxide\ninsulating layer 52 exposed between the metallization\nstrips) not covered by the adhesive. The wafer is then\nremoved from the solution, rinsed thoroughly with\nwater, and dried. After subsequent coats of lead sulfide\nare deposited by repeating these immersion, rinsing and\ndrying steps, the wafer is removed from the glass slide\nand all traces of the adhesive are removed from the\nwafer. The topography of the metallization strips is\nclearly apparent through an opaque layer of several\nlead sulfide coatings, thus facilitating alignment of a\nlead sulfide delineation mask with the existing circuit\npattern on the wafer.\nThe photo-responsive element Ro and circuit resistances RL, Rs are etched from the multi-coat lead sul-\n\n5\n\n4,709,252\n\nfide layer by a photolithographic delineation process. A\nlayer of positive photoresist is spun onto the lead sulfide\nlayer and air dried in a controlled relative humidity\nenvironment. A chromium mask defining the pattern of\nb, and\nRL\naligned with the visible topography of 5\nthe wafer and the photoresist is exposed through the\nmask. The pattern is developed and unwanted photoresist removed. Lead sulfide not covered by photo-resist\nmay be removed by several different etching procedures. In one such procedure, the wafer is briefly immersed in fresh, concentrated hydrochloric acid maintained at a temperature between 25" C. and 30" C.,\ngently rinsed in water maintained at the same temperature, blown dry with an inert gas, and examined for\nundercutting of the lead sulfide pattern of the Ro, Rr.\nand Rs islands. If excessive lead sulfide remains outside\nthe pattern, the etching steps are repeated by briefly\nreimmersing the wafer in hydrochloric acid. When\nmost of the unwanted lead sulfide has been removed,\nthe wafer is immersed in acetone e remove the pho- 20\no\ntoreist covering the RD, RL and R s pattern,\nThe resulting wafer, shown in FIGS. 1 and 4&, has\nthree clearly defined islands of lead sulfide RD, RL and\nRs. Opposite under sides of photo-responsive element\nR o partially cover and form ohmic contacts with a 25\ncenter section of metallization strip 26 and one end of\nmetallization strip 28. Opposite sides of resistance Rs\npartially cover and form ohmic contacts with a center\nsection of metallization strip 22 and one end of metallization strip 24. Similarly, opposite sides of resistance 30\nRLpartially cover and form ohmic contacts with 0 ~ ~ 0\nsite ends of metallization strips 26 and 30. The photoresponsive element RD may be sensitized to infrared\nradiation by briefly heat& the dement and exposing it\nto oxygen. Then, the entire surface of the wafer (the 35\nlead sulfide elements RD, RL and Rs, the ~ ~ C O v e r e d\nmetallization strips, and the exposed areas of silicon\ndioxide layer 58) is covered with an electrically insulating passivation layer 90 of silicon dioxide as shown in\nFIGS. 3h and k.\n40\nLead chalogenides change resistance when\nnated by light, particularly light in the near and intermediate infrared spectrum\' To prevent variation Of the\nOf resistances RL and Rswhen the device is exposed to infrared radiation, a layer of an opaque mate- 45\nrial such as aluminum. is deuosited on the surface 92 of\nthe passivation layer 90. The layer is then photolithographically etched to remove all but two areas 86,88 of\nthe opaque layer which cover resistance RL (shown in\nFIG. &) and resistance Rs, as indicated by the diagonal 50\ncross-hatching from upper right to lower left in FIG. 5.\nSubsequently, windows, shown in FIG. 5 as square\nareas of diagonal cross-hatching extending from the\nupper left to the lower right, are etched into the passivation layer 90 to expose the terminal pad areas 32, 34, 55\n36, 38, 40 and 42 for connection to external electrical\nleads (not shown).\nAs indicated by FIG. 2, a battery V B connected to\nterminal pads 40, 42 provides a voltage across the divider stage formed by resistance Rr. and photo-respon- 60\nsive element R o t o bias the gate electrode of transistor\nT to an ON state. Illumination of element RD with\nI\ninfrared radiation will decrease the resistance value of\nRD, thereby causing the voltage across the drain and\nsource terminals 34, 32 to decrease in response to the 65\nillumination. The voltage, V,, at the drain terminal is\nrelated to the resistance provided by element RD according to the following equation:\n\n6\n(RD)\nGFE~\nRD + RL\n\nV, = V B - .\n\nwhere, GFET, transistor gain, has a value of about\nthe\n0.9. It is apparent, therefore, that the value of Vo is an\naccurate, representation of the illumination to which\nelement RD is exposed, and is unaffected by spurious\nimpedances which may be introduced by elaborate wire\ninterconnecting leads.\nThe invention disclosed has an infrared photoresponsive element monolithically integrated into a\nmetal oxide semiconductor circuit to provide a unitary\nphoto-detector and signal processing device. The device may be easily fabricated to provide a circuit such as\nthe source preamplifier for the data stream generated by\nthe detector element. The complete absence of wire\ninterconnecting leads between the photo-responsive\nelement and the active component effectively reduces\nthe space required by each circuit while facilitating\nfabrication of the device. Consequently, the reduction\nin size allows a greater density of these devices to be\nfabricated in a focal plane array, thereby enabling generation of a data stream providing for heightened resolution of focal plane images.\nThe configuration of the circuit may be modified for\nparticular applications. Rr, rather than Romay b used as\na photo-responsive element simply by covering RD\ninstead of RL with an opaque layer. Other lead chalcogenide materials such as lead selenide or lead telluride\nmay be used instead of lead sulfide to make the photoresponsive elements and the resistances. The active\ndevice may also be made from a substrate having p-type\nconductivity. The circuit may be made with an active\ndevice having either p or n channel depletion or P or n\nchannel enhancement. Additionally,\ncomplex\ncircuits and active lead chalcogenide photo~responsive\nelements may be mono~ithica~ly\nintegrated with other\nactive devices in more complex circuits according to\nthe principles disclosed. Also, the devices may be made\nphoto-responsive\nwith a circuit having two or\ndetector elements made of different binary or ternary\nlead chalcogenide alloys to provide a spectral response\ntailored for a particular application.\n..\nWe claim:\nI.A photo-responsive device comprising:\na substrate (50) of semiconducting silicon containing\nimpurities of a first type conductivity;\na source (S) region and a drain (D) region containing\nimpurities of a second and opposite type conductivity extending inwardly from a surface (51) of said\nsubstrate and separated by a gate (G) region of said\nfirst type conductivity;\na layer (58) of silicon dioxide disposed upon said\nsurface defining discrete openings (60, 62) separated by a strip of said silicon dioxide covering said\nsurface at said gate region;\na plurality of electrical conductors (20,22,24,26,28,\n30) disposed upon said silicon dioxide layer in a\nspaced configuration with a first of said electrical\nconductors making electrical contact with said\nsource region via one of said openings, a second of\nsaid electrical conductors making electrical\ncontact with said drain region via another of said\nopenings, and a third of said electrical conductors\ntransversing said strip of silicon dioxide;\n\n7\n\n4,709,252\n\na first island (Ro) of a lead chalcogenide material\nexhibiting a photo-responsivity to infrared radiation lying on said silicon dioxide layer in ohmic\ncontact with said third electrical conductor and\none of said other of said plurality of conductors; 5\na second island (RL) of a lead chalcogenide material\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nlying on said silicon dioxide layer in ohmic contact\nwith said third electrical conductor and another of\nsaid other of said plurality of conductors; and\na layer (86/88) of a material opaque to said infrared\nradiation completely covering said second island.\n\n* * * * *\n\n'
