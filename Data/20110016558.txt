The relay spacecraft\ninclude two already in orbit plus several\nothers planned to arrive at Mars in the\nyears 2004 through 2008. A major portion of the report is devoted to the orbit\nof the G. Macroni Orbiter, which is in\nthe midst of an iterative design process\nand is intended to be the first Mars orbiter designed primarily for radio relay.\nCandidate orbits are analyzed with a\nview toward choosing one that maximizes the amount of time available for\ncommunication with surface units, taking account of visibility as a function of\nposition, the limit on communication\ndistance at low power, and the fact that\nsurface units can transmit more easily\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, January 2004\n\nwhen they are in sunlight. Two promising new orbits for Mars relay satellites\nare identified: a 1/2-sol apoapsis-at-constant-time-of-day equatorial orbit and a\n1/4-sol apoapsis-at-constant-time-of-day,\ncritical-inclination orbit.\nThis work was done by Gary Noreen, Roger\nDiehl, and Joseph Neelon of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

To recapitulate: An antenna as\n\nproposed would include a reflectarray\nmembrane stretched flat on a frame of\nmultiple tubular booms that would be deployed by inflation. The instant report\ndiscusses design concepts and relevant\nbasic mechanical principles. Among the\nconcepts are alternative configurations of\nbooms for holding the reflectarray membrane and its radio-frequency feed horn\nand the use of catenaries and constantforce springs to stretch the reflectarray\nmembrane on the frame at the required\ntension. Some emphasis is placed on the\nneed to keep the deployed frame rigid\nwithout depending on maintenance of inflation in the presence of impinging micrometeors that could cause leaks: for this\npurpose, the booms could be made as\nspring-tape-reinforced aluminum laminate tubes like those described in the second-mentioned prior article.\nThis work was done by Houfei Fang,\nMichael Lou, and John Huang of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
