One spacecraft will orbit\nthe planet and send scientific information back to\nEarth for months. The other will carry four probes\n\nVenus is a fascinating planet because it is\n\nalmost a twin of Earth but has developed quite\ndifferently so that our type of life cannot live on its\nsurface. Scientists want to find out why it\ndeveloped the way it did, and in so doing, gain\ngreater insight into the nature of the processes\n\nthat have molded our Earth and brought it to the\nconditions of today.\n\nWhen Venus passes between Earth and Sun,\nand thus comes closest to the Earth, it passes\nthrough what astronomers call inferior\nconjunction. On the far side of the Sun it passes\nthrough superior conjunction (see Figure 2). The\npositions of greatest elongation correspond to\nquadratures on the orbit.\n\nVenus as a Member of the Solar System\nAfter the Sun and the Moon, Venus is the\nbrightest object in the sky. If you know where to\nlook you can sometimes see Venus in broad\ndaylight. Like other planets Venus appears to\nmove through the constellations of the Zodiac,\nbut it is never seen far from the Sun because it is\nan "inferior" planet. That is, it travels along an\norbit within that of the Earth. Venus takes only 225\ndays to go corT pletely around the Sun. The\nposition of Venus east or west of the Sun is\n\nreferred to as an elongation. At eastern elongation\nyou can see it as a bright, star-like object in the\nevening sky. At western elongation you have to\nlook for it rising before the Sun in the early\nmorning sky (Figure 1).\nApparent Daily\nPath of Setting Sun\n\n/\t\n\nVenus\t\n\nSuperior\nConjunction\t\nI\t\n\n^\t\n\nSun\t\n\n\\\n\n\\\t\n\n\\\n^I\t\n\nI\n\n1\n\nkQuadralure\t\n\nI\n\n\\\t\n\n\\\t\n\nI\n\nInferior\n\nConjunction\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\nEarth\n\nFigure 2.

But\nits surface is hotter, its atmosphere much denser,\nand its rotations much slower than those of the\nEarth. Venus is one of the three planets of the\nsolar system that do not have satellites; the others\nare Mercury and Pluto. Also Venus does not have\na significant magnetic field.\nThe diameter of Venus is 12,100 km (7519 mi)\n\nand its average density is 5.25 times that of water.\nThis high density may imply that Venus has a core\nof nickel and iron like the Earth.\nThe surface of Venus cannot be observed\nvisually from Earth because Venus is shrouded it,.\na thick blanket of clouds. However, radar waves\nfrom Earth stations penetrate to the surface and\nastronomers have used them to map the surface\nof Venus. In addition, the surface emits radio\nwaves\xe2\x80\x94microwaves\xe2\x80\x94which penetrate the clouds\nand can be received on Earth. Astronomers use\nthese radio waves to estimate the temperature of\nthe planet\'s surface.\n\na\n\nIn the early 1960\'s when these measurements\nwere first made, astronomers were surprised to\ndiscover that the surface of Venus is extremely\n\nhot. The microwaves carry the message that it is\nabout 430\xc2\xb0C which is hot enough to melt zinc.\nThey also told us that the temperature is the same\nboth day and night on the surface of Venus.\nThe surface temperature of Venus is much\nhigher than that of the Earth. This difference is\nattributed to the dense atmosphere of Venus\n\nwhich traps incoming solar radiation and prevents\n\nradio echo that Venus rotates once in 243.1 days,\nin a direction opposite to the rotation of the Earth.\n\nThis is called a retrograde direction. A day (the\ntime from one sunrise to the next) on Venus lasts\nabout 117 Earth days (Figure 4).\nAnother peculiar fact about the rotation of\nVenus is that it seems to be linked to the Earth.\nEach time g enus passes closest to the Earth at\ninferior conjunction, the same face of Venus is\nturned towards the Earth. Most astonomers\nbelieve this is just a coincidence, but it may not\nbe.\nAstronomers do not know why Venus rotates so\nslowly. The other planets (except Mercury) rotate\nquickly on their axes. Mercury has been slowed by\ntidal friction because of its closeness to the Sun;\nbut Venus is not only rotating slowly, it is also\nrotating in the "wrong" direction. The Sun could\nnot have caused this. One possibility, proposed\n\nsome years ago, is that Venus once had a big\nsatellite that revolved around it in the retrograde\ndirection. This satellite crashed into Venus and\n\nstopped the planet\'s rotation, or perhaps even\npushed it a little into rotating the opposite way.\nAstronomers looked at the spectrum of light\nreflected from the clouds of Venus and were able\nto find that its atmosphere contains much (97 %)\nNoon\n\n8:00 am\nVenus Times\n\n/\t\n\nj;7% 4:00 am\n\nI\n\nMidnight\nOrbit\t\n\nFigure 3.

This is\ntermed the "greenhouse effect."\nA telescope reveals no details in the yellowish\nclouds of Venus. However, if these clouds are\nphotographed in ultraviolet light, dark shadings\ncan be seen that rotate in a period of about 4 days.\nThese shading- have also been seen more clearly\nin ultraviolet pictures of Venus taken from a\n\nI\t\n\n^^^YYY\n\n/\'\t\n\nI\n\n\\\t\n\n0 8:00 pm\n\nRotation\t\n\nJ(.^ ,:pp pm\n\nNoon\n\npassing spacecraft (Figure 3).\n\nAxial Rotation: 243.1 Earth days\nOrbital period: 225 Earth days ( = Venus year)\nNoon to Noon: 116.8 Earth days (= Venus day)\nVenus year: 1.93 Venus days\n\nBut the planet itself rotates much more slowly\nthan its cloud tops. ,\'Again the discovery was made\nby radio waves.

This again is a contrast to Earth\nwhich only has a small amount (0.03%) of carbon\ndioxide in its atmosphere. The reason there is so\nmuch carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Venus\nis thought to be because Venus is a dry planet.\nThe presence of oceans of water on Earth allowed\nEarth\'s early atmosphere of carbon dioxide to\nreact with the rocks and form carbonates. Today,\nmost of Earth\'s carbon dioxide is bound up as\ncarbonates in rocks. Also living things on Earth\nused carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to\nprovide ca , `-on for their bodies. Oxygen was\nreleased b^ plants to form Earth\'s oxygen-rich\natmosphere of today.\nAnother big difference between Earth and\n\nof bubbling petroleum. All were wrong, though the\ndesert concept seems closest to what is now\nknown. Photographs from the Veneta spacecraft\n(Figure 5) revealed a dry rocky surface fractured\nand changed by unknown processes. There are\nrocks of many different kinds and a dark soil. The\ntwo spacecraft landed about 2000 ! gy m (1200 mi)\nfrom each other. One landed on an ancient plateau\nor plains area. At this site there are rocky\nelevations interspersed with a relatively dark,\nfine-grained soil. This soil seems to have resulted\nfrom a weathering of the rocks, possibly by a\nchemical action. The rocky outcrops are generally\nsmooth on a large scale, with their edges blunted\nand rounded. The dark soil fills some of the\n\nVenus, as mentioned earlier, is that Venus does\nnot have a magnetic field of any significance. As a\n\ncavities in the rocks.

These particles are held away from the\nEarth by our magnetic field. But they speed\ndirectly into the upper atmosphere of Venus.\n\nyounger and less weathered, with not much\n\nThe Surface of Venus\nDetails on the surface of Venus were virtually\n\nunknown until two Soviet Venera spacecraft\nlanded on it in 1975 and returned pictures. Earlier\nspeculations had ranged from steaming swamps\nto dusty deserts, from carbonated seas to oceans\n\nlanded at a site where there are rocks which look\nevidence of soil between them.\nMeasurements made by the Russian spacecraft\nshowed that all these rocks on Venus have a\ndensity and radioactive content similar to\nterrestrial basaltic rocks.\nIn 1962, craters were discovered on radar maps\nof the planet (Figure 6). Subsequently, radar\nastronomers found evidence of large lava flows,\ngreat circular basins like those of the Moon, and\neven chasms and volcanoes like those on Mars.\nGenerally, however, the surface of Venus is not so\nrugged as Earth and Mars. Radar measurements\nof altitude variation on Venus amount to only\n\nFigure 5. Ttie first pictures of the surface of Venus were returned to Earth by two Soviet Veneta spacecraft that landed\non Venus in 1975. The top picture is from Veneta 9 and the bottom from Veneta 10. They show rocky terrains which are\nsurprisingly different at the two sites, the Veneta 10 site showing evidence of much greater age, inferred from the\nweathered nature of the rocks.\n\ny^\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nni\nn1\n\na\n\nf\t\n\nabout 5 km (3 mi) compared with Earth\'s range of\n20 km (12 mi) between the top of Mt. Everest and\nthe bottom of the Marianas Trench, and Mars\'\nrange of 30 km (20 mi) between the top of Olympus\nMons and the bottom of the Hellas basin.\nThe existence of craters and other features on\nthe surface of Venus suggests that the planet had\nbeen subjected to a bombardment from space\nearly in its history, just as the other inner planets\nof the solar system were bombarded, and that\n\nchlorine and fluorine, and ice crystals. The clouds\nare pale yellow in color and reflect about 85% of\nthe sunlight failing upon them. Their true nature\nwas not discovered until a few years &go, when\nastronomers used a variety of observations to\nshow that the clouds are composed of droplets of\nsulfuric acid.\n200\'\n\nafterwards there were volcanic activities, lava\nflows, and possibly some mountain building. The\nevolution of Venus may have progressed to an\neven more Earth-like state than that of Mars. But\nthe absence of water on Venus prevented it from\nbecoming like the Earth is today.\n\nWeakly\nIonized\n\nle0\n\n160\n\nMain\n\nIonization\n\n140\n\nUpper\nAtmosphere\n\nWeakly\t\nIonized\n120\n\nLayers\n\nE\nY\nc 100\n\nQ\n\nm\n\nUpper\nHazes\nLower\n\n60\n\nHazes\n\nmr = -\n\nTropopause \'\nClouds\t\n\n^ Clouds\n\nWind\t\nShear\n\nI\n\nLow Hazes\t\nAerosols\t\nDust\n\nLower\nAtmosphere\n\nClear\n\nAtmosphere\nSurface\nCrust\n\n0\nF igure 6.

The dark band\nacross the p icture covers an area for which radar data were not\nobtained.\n\nThe Atmosphere of Venus\nThe atmosphere of Venus (Figure 7) was\ndiscovered by a Russian astronorner in the 16th\ncentury when the planet was seen to cross the\nface of the Sun in transit. The black disc of\nVenus silhouetted against the Sun was distorted\nby the planet\'s atmosphere when close to the\nedge of the Sun. Also, other astronomers saw the\natmosphere extending the arms of the crescent\nVenus.\nThe brilliant clouds of Venus were at one time\nthought to be clouds of water droplets.

Space probes and ground-based observations have\nestablished these details of the structure of the Venusian\natmosphere. The curve across the lower part of the sketch\nshows the wind speed at altitudes measured by one of the\nSoviet spacecraft.\n\nThe general composition of the atmosphere\nwas not known until 1932 when carbon dioxide\nwas discovered by the use of a spectroscope to\nanalyze the light from the planet. Space probes\nhave confirmed that the atmosphere of Venus is\nabout 97% carbon dioxide, and that it is almost\n100 times as dense as Earth\'s atmosphere.\nThe atmospheres of Earth and Venus probably\noriginated from radioactive heating of both\nplanets. As the rocks became hot, lightweight\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY \t\n\n5\n\ngases such as carbon dioxide and water "boiled\noff" (outgassed) from the mantle and crust. If\nVenus went through as much outgassing as the\nEarth, it would be exr ected to have had originally\nan atmosphere consisting of carbon dioxide in an\namount 100 times the amount of all Earth\'s\npresent-day atmosphere, and of water equivalent\nto the amount in the Earth\'s oceans.\nThe Earth has held water in its oceans because\nits surface is not hot enough to evaporate all the\nwater into its atmosphere, which has a region of low\ntemperature (a cold trap) in the stratosphere that\nprevents water vapor from rising to a height at\nwhich solar ultraviolet radiation could break water\nmolecules into oxygen and hydrogen.\nOn Venus, which is closer to the Sun, the planet\nwas probably hot enough originally for all the\nwater to evaporate into the atmosphere. In such a\nwater-saturated, hot atmosphere there could be\nno cold trap, and water would break down into\noxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen would have\nleaked off into space. The oxygen might have\nreacted with surface rocks to oxidize them, but\nthis is only speculation.\nAnother theory is that Venus was not formed\nfrom the same basic materials as the Earth and\ndid not have much water to begin with.\nWhichever way it happened, Venus is very short\no water today. Its atmosphere is extremely dry,\nespecially above the clouds.\nAnother effect of the dense atmosphere of\ncarbon dioxide is to trap incoming solar radiation\nand prevent heat radiation from the surface and\nthe lower atmosphere from escaping back into\nspace. The surface temperature of 480\xc2\xb0C (900\xc2\xb0F)\npermits very active chemical reactions between\nthe atmosphere and the surface materials, and\nmany substances that on Earth would be bound in\nthe rocks are probably released into the\natmosphere of Venus. These include chlorine and\nfluorine.\nLike on Earth, sulfur is probably released into\nthe atmosphere of Venus. This sulfur rises high\ninto the Venusian atmosphere where it combines\nwith water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid. It\nis a haze of droplets of sulfuric acid, more\nconcentrated than the acid in an automobile\'s\nbattery, that forms the very deep clouds of Venus.\nThese hazy clouds are not thickly opaque like rain\nclouds of Earth, but tl,ay have extremely deep\nlayers. Their tops are 80 km (50 mi) above the\nsurface of Venus, and their bottoms are about 50\nkm (30 mi) above the hot surface of the planet.\nAbove and below the sulfuric acid clouds are\nother thinner haze layers of unknown\ncomposition. But there seems to be a clear region\nfor about 20 km (12 mi) above the surface. Thus,\nwhile Earth\'s first 20 km are cloud filled, on Venus\n\n6\n\nthese first 20 km of atmosphere are clear. Venus\'\nclouds and weather begin at the level of Earth\'s\nupper stratosphere.\nClose to the surface of Venus there are only\nslight breezes, whereas at the top of the sulfuric\nacid clouds the winds reach 360 km/hr (220 mi/hr),\ncomparable to Earth\'s jet streams. The high winds\nof Venus sweep around the planet and make it\nappear that the topmost regions of the clouds\n(visible in ultraviolet light as dark and light\nshadings) whirl around the planet in about 4 days.\nThere are also circulating motions within the\natmosphere. Regions of rising gas are located\nalong the equator where solar heat affects the\natmosphere most. Other regions of descending\ngas are located toward the poles. The atmosphere\nis known to be in circulation because the\ntemperature is virtually the same on the day and\nnight sides and from equator to poles. Therefore\nthe atmosphere of Venus must be constantly\nagitated like water coming to the boil in a\nsaucepan.\nDown close to the surface, thermal (heat)\nchemical reactions occur in the atmospheric\ngases and between the atmosphere and the\nsurface rocks. Above the sulfuric acid clouds\nchemical reactions are controlled by the\nultraviolet solar radiation; they are photochemical\nreactions. Within the droplets of the clouds other\nchemical reactions take place in a liquid phase.\nThe chemistry of the atmosphere of Venus is thus\nextremely complex, and it is not yet thoroughly\nunderstood.\nHigh above the clouds and the hazes is the\nupper atmosphere of Venus which changes into a\nregion of mainly helium and hydrogen, called the\nexosphere, and then into interplanetary space.\nIncoming solar radiation affects the atoms and\nmolecules of the upper atmospheric gases and\nionizes them, making them electrically charged.\nThis forms an ionosphere somewhat similar to\nEarth\'s ionosphere. Both ionospheres have layers.\nWe use the layers in Earth\'s ionosphere to reflect\ncertain frequencies of radio waves around the\nworld for long-distance radio communications.\nThe layers of the ionosphere of Venus are not as\nintensely ionized as those of Earth\'s ionosphere,\nand are generally lower and thinner. Also the\ntemperature of Venus\' ionosphere is much less\nthan that of Earth\'s ionosphere. So while Venus\'\nlower atmosphere is hotter than that of the Earth,\nits upper atmosphere is cooler.\nAs already mentioned, because Venus does not\nhave a magnetic field of any consequence, its\nupper atmosphere receives directly the solar wind\nof protons and electrons streaming from the Sun.\nThis causes a sharp boundary for Venus\'\n\nionosphere, at an altitude of only 350 to 500 km\n(200 to 300 mi) on the day side of the planet. On\nthe night side, the ionosphere trails out behind\nthe planet in a "tail" extending downwind into\nin!.-rplanetary space (Figure 8).\n\nI\n\nTransition\nRegion\n\nlonopause\nPla\t Ana\nT;\n..a\'\t\n\nVenus, Young, A. and Young, L., Scientific\nAmerican, Vol. 233, Sept. 1975, pp. 71-78\nThe Atmosphere of Mars and Venus, Eshleman,\nVon R., Scientific American, March 1969,\npp. 79-88\nThe New Venus, Ksanfomalita, L.V. et al., New\nScientist, Vol. 73, January 20, 1977, pp. 127-129\nSurface of Venus, Evidence of Diverse Landforms\nby Radar Observations, Malin, M.C., and\nSanders, R.S., Science, Vol. 196, May 27, 1977,\npp. 987-994\n\nBow Shock\n\nSolar\nWind\n\nFurther Reading\n\nShade\nCavity\n\nMariner 10 Science Reports, various authors,\nScience, Vol. 183, March 29, 1974, pp. 1289-1321\nVenus Exploration With the Veneta 9 and Venera\n10 Spacecraft, Icarus, Vol. 30, No. 4, 197?,\npp. 605-625\n\nStudent Projects\n1.Planetary Orbits and Apparitions\nYou are given the following information:\nRarefaction\nWave\n\nFigure 8.

Behind the planet is\na cavity and a plasma tail.\n\nThere are many unanswered questions about\nVenus which scientists hope will be answered by\nnew information to be provided by NASA\'s\nPioneer-Venus spacecraft. Such questions\ninclude:\nWhat causes the weather on Venus?\nIs it really a greenhouse effect that makes the\nplanet so hot?\nWhat causes the dark markings in the Venus\nclouds?\nWhat are the various constituents of the Venus\natmosphere?\nHow does the ionosphere interact with the solar\nwind?\nHow these and other questions about Venus\nmight be answered by the Pioneer-Venus mission\nwill be discussed in another fact sheet of this\nseries.\n\nMean distance of Venus from the Sun is 107.5\nmillion km.
