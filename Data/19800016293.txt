A market\nanalysis task has included personal interviews by GE personnel and supplemental\nmail surveys to acquire statistical data and to identify and measure attitudes,\nreactions and intentions of prospective SPS users. Over 500 firms were\ncontacted, including throe ownership classes of electric utilities, industrial\nfirms in the top SIC codes for energy consumption, and design engineering\nfirms. A market demand model was developed which utilizes the data base\ndeveloped by personal, interviews and surveys, and projected enezqy price and\nconsumption data to perform sensitivity analyses and estimate potential, markets\nfor SPS.\nINTRODUCTION\nThis presentation reviews the on-going GE Advanced Energy Department study of\nEffects of System Factors on the Economics of and Demand for Small (110 MWe)\nSolar Thermal Power stems (SPS). The study goals are to estimate market\npenetration rates for t:hesa tyetems as a function of time, SPS performance\nfactors and market/economic considerations, and to develop cost effective\nstrategies for accelerating the market penetration rate for promising near-term\napplications. Three major tasks comprising this study include; market;\nanalysts, market penetration sensitivity analysis, and commercialization\nstrategy formulation. This review summarizes the market analysis tasks, with\nemphasis on results obtained from the personal interviews and mail survey\nconducted. The market demand model is also presented.\nSTUDY APPROACH\nA nationwide study was conducted among three major classes of utility\nownership, :i.e., investor-owned utilities, rural electric cooperatives, and\nmunicipal systems, among the top eight energy consuming classifications of\nindustrial firms, and among selected design engineering firms. Types of\nindustrials contacted in the study included chemicals, paper, food,\ntransportation equipment, textiles, stone, clay, glass, petroleum refining, and\nothers. Firms in all fifty states were included in the study sample. The\nselection of industrial firms included an equal number of firms with and\nwithout to-plant generation equipment to help remove bias caused by this\nvariable. Similarly, the electric utility firms contacted included both firms\nwhich generated all or part of their power requirements as well as nongenerators which function as distributors and resellers of electric power.\n\nover 240 industrial, 200 utility and 70 design engineering firms were\n\ncontacted. Although there were some firms which declined to ra.rtiotpate in the\nstudy for a variety of reasons, the overall, response rate has been high and is\ncurrently about 60%.\n\n185\n\nPersonal interviews were conducted by projoct personnel and members of GE\nindustrial Sales and klectric Utility sales DWistons, In additior to the\n\nmarket study information provided by the .firms being int~.arviewed, many cif the\nGE field sales engineers provided their views and ceawtanta on the SPS and\npotential for applications of solar electric systems. Gonftdontirlity of data\nprovided was stressed with all respondents and was a key factor i r their study\nparticipation, particularly in providing financial and inveatrre\xc2\xb1nt criteria\ninformation.\nIn addition to personal interviews, a supplemental mail survey activity was\nconducted A list of firms was carefully compiled to assure tlat it was ac\nrepresentative as possible and with minimum biases, All firms were contacted\nin advance to verify name; title, and address of the y survey respondent. Each\n\nindividual was sent a personal letter from the y GE Program Manager soliciting\n,participation in the sutdy, material doacribtng the SPS and a comprehensive\nquestionnaire. After a reaconahle pertod of time, all who had rot responded\n\nwere contacted to verify receipt of the survey package. .. Duplicate mailings\nwere sent to anyone who had not received the original mail,lntt. \'telephone\nintertvews were conducted by p^ ., fesstonal interviewers in those cases in which\n\nthe survey package had beer received, and the respondent preferred such an\ninterview rather than returning the completed questionna ires. To reduce bias\nfrom a dqt&tied technical evaluation of vyetemo, concep to ":r otti ay\n\nresultin g\n\nparticipants, only a broad overview of the solar systems retng considered by\ndPL was given. System configuration data and cc-st estimates were derived from\n\ndata provided. by 4rPL. Both the distributed collection central, generation and\ndistributed generation concepts were presented to encompass systems with and\n\nwithout process stream\t\n\noutput. sufficient detail was given to entiale\n\nrespondents to answer questions regarding the possibility that they would\nconsider an SIPS as a possible power plant option in the 1990 time frame. SPS\nland area requirements for three representative solar regions of the country\nwere developed, as well as projected system and bulbar energy costs for each\nregion. SPS capacity factor o2 forty percent was used in the system\ndescriptions.\nINITIAL FINDINGS\nIndustrial Firm Responses\n\nPrimary reasons for in--plant generation were determined from responses of\nindustrial firms which now generate all or some of their electric power\nrequirements. Reasons stated in descending order of importance includes the\nfact that generation is a by-product of steam production, that is is less\nexpensive than purchased power, that it provides a non-interruptible power\nsource, or that the firm has an inexpensive fuel source.\nInformation on plans for dealing with future energy requirements was also\nsolicited, and provided data on plans for conversion to other fuel types,\nadding or replacing existing in-plant generation equipment, or purchasing of\ngreater proportions of electrical, needs.\n\n186\n\nAmong the factors which would have the most influence in consideration of\npurchase of a BPS in the 1990 time frame, the list included; meeting the\ncompany\'s financial criteria for capital investmento, lower operating costa\nthan conventional systems, tax credits, delivered energy costs ()d/kWh), and\nability to fossil fixe the BPS to achieve higher capacity factor. \'rho least\ninfluential factors includedi appearance or aesthetics of the f3yntem sp\nmodularity and relocatability, loan guarantoos, and the exchange of excess\npower with local utilities.\nFifty-six percent of the industrial firms contacted stated that they would\nconsider the BPS as an option in the 1990--time frame. Of these posttttves\nresponses, 59W felt that the sp S would most: likely be considered as an addition\nto their present generating equipment, 27% as a replacement for the generation\nequipment now on-Mina, and 21% as a\xe2\x96\xba system to repower existing power plant;.\nDue to multiple answers by some firms, these total.. over 100%. Major SPS\nbenefits perceived included fuel availability, energy price protection, clean\nnon-polluting system, and availability of steam or process heat. Major\ndrawbacks were cited as land cast and availability, bulbar energy cast, system\ncapital, cost, and low capacity factor.\n\nThe mean after tax rate of return on investment (ROI) required was 19 percent.\n5, - o\nfor -I stall-t"Lori _ f ih _ Y^i Wd 3\n\'\nn -pu lt-a\t\ne\n\t aL ivn sue= cCl ^ V\naverage\t ric e nF e.s^$\'A\' " a\nT\t\nThe\t ....,r..y\tprice , \'\t Industrial . ^.w^+i\t g nu 4c.cx F^ c\'r\t brz Lu\n$20\t ,600 per acre. hand prices varied from a few hundred dollars to over\n$100,000 per acre.\nElectric Utility Responses\n\nAn overall positive response rate of Fifty-five percent was expressed by\nutility firms with regard to whether they would consider an BPS as a power\nplant option in the 1990-time frame. Among those responding in the\nafftrmative, 76% perceived the BPS as an addition to present generating\ncapacity,14% as a system for repowering existing power plants, and 16% as a\nreplacement for generating equipment now on-line.\nThe most influential factors considered by utilities in the purchase of an BPS\nwere meeting the firms\' capital investment requirements, busbar cost of\nelectricity, lower operating costs than conventional systems, initial system\nprice ($ per kilowatt) and demonstrations o r BPS in the local area. The least\ninfluential were availability of process steam, usability to power existing\nplants, and tax credits. Major benefits perceived included transmission\n\nsavings, price protection, fuel availability, and clean non-polluting system.\nMajor drawbacks to BPS perceived by utilities were low capacity ,factor, land\ncost and availability, system capital costs, and non-proven technology.\nThe average fixed charge rate for utility firms was approximately twenty\n,percent, while the required Rol was about twelve percent. The price of\nsuitable land for BPS utility installations averaged $8,700 per acre.\nDesign Engineering Respons es\n\nThe seventy design engineering firms were contacted for qualitative data and to\n\n18 7\n\n\t\n\nobtain their views and reactions to the two system configurations presented,\nThe BPS configuration option featuring central generation wa3 preferred 2:1 by\nthe design engineering firma responding. Most were concerned about solar\nonaergy variability and felt that supplemental fossil fuel firing for added\ncapacity factor was important. The availability of process steam as an output\nwas a desirable feature. In general, these firms were not as concerned about\nland cost and availability as industrial and electrical firms contacted,\nperhaps reflecting the fact that they may be somewhat insulated from the\neffects\n\nof Land costs.\n\nMART DEMAND MODEL\n\nA schematic diagram of\n\nthe BPS demand model is shown below.\n\n"Orl y "",IURNINT\nIhI11QYt^lITl.\ntiCACAT144hATT1 "`\t\n\nIN \xe2\x96\xbaUT\t\n\n%OCNICT SIN T\ni\n\nAVAIIAW\t\n\nEYETIMastI\t\n040MIC:IN4CN 11V, \'"`^\'\t\n\n^.4C3CCIr011VICN\'\t\niNR a Sn\t\n"ICdhOMIC`\n_\t\n.....\n\nEICTORM\n\nMANNITINTICTOR\t\n\n^A 61AN.....\t\n\n,,tip COfi pf p T1tYINCd\t\n.

FLOWCHAR T\t.\n\nM.pK[Y\nEATAY40WNEY\n\n.1TAI\n\niN gUITnY\n\nPrincipal user inputs to the model include: year for which BPS market\nestimate is desired, SPS cost estimate at that time. ^SPS performance electrical and thermal. output (including variation with tnsolation level),\napplicable economic incentives such as tax credits, either a :future energy\nprise scenario or, alternatively, price escalation rates which the model can\napply to current price levels.\nModel output is an estimate of BPS total industrial, market at the year of\ninterest and a breakdown by individual sectors industries and states.\nExercise of the model for a series of years and corresponding system costs will\nyield a market penetration scenario. input parameters can be varied to test\nthe sensitivity of each on the rate of penetration.\nThe data model input includes Edison Electric institute data on energy prices\nand Survey of Manufacturers data on energy prices and energy consumption.\nPrice and consumption data are augmented with data from the personal interviews\nand mail survey.\n\n188\n\nPrincipal interview and survey inputs to the model. include (in approximate\norder of importance): economic criteria applicable to investment in equipment\nsuch as SPS, land availability and cost, non-economic influences (such as\npollution problems, energy curtailment protection, etc.), strategies to meet\nfuture energy requirements, and desirable SPS system characteristics.\nActual treatment of these inputs in the model depends on the type and quality\nof interview responses. Items si,cb an land costa and economic criteria are\nfound to be statistically distributed so as to be representable by standard\ndistribution curves in most sectors. Where this is not the case, tabular data\nis utilized.\nWithin a sector, given Land cost distribution and the input system cost, a\ntotal cost distribution is first computed. Energy price for the sector at the\nreference year is obtained either from the input price scenario or from\ncvxrent prices and the input escalation rates. The economic criteria\ndistribution is then employed to determine, based on energy price versus SPS\nperformance and cost, what portion of the sector will view SPS as economic or\ncost effective.\nOnce economic viability is reached, SPS penetration rate will be assumed to\nfollow historical patterns typified by the Fisher-Pry substitution model.. The\navailable market within a sector will be established from current sector\nenergy requirements and future projections. Interviews and surveys have\nidentified market diluters, such as land non-avatlabtlity, that reduce the\navailable SPS market size. Combining the available sector market with the\nabove determined penetration rates yields the estimated SPS market at the\nparticular point in time of interest. Combining all sectors yields total SPS\nmarket. Data on product technology substitutions experienced by the General\nElectric Company in various power generation equipment fields will be used in\nestablishing a historical trend data base for the model.. The SPS demand model\nis easily expandable to more sectors either to enlarge the scope of the market\nassessment or to "fine tune" the results.\nCONCLUSIONS AND COMMENTS\nThe high response rate from industrial, utility and design engineering firms\nachieved during the market analysis task is a strong indication of a high\nlevel of interest in SPS. Data obtained from the personal interviews and mail\nsurvey activities is now on computer files. There are approximately 140\nvariables associated with each industrial questionnaire and 100 with each\nutility questionnaire completed. The data base contains information on\nresent and future electrical requirements, electricity purchases and in-plant\ngeneration, process steam use, options for dealing with future energy\nrequirements, land costs, investment criteria, and factors which would\ninfluence SPS purchase considerations by industrial and utility firms and\nother such information. The demand model and this data base provide a means\nfor performing market penetration rate sensitivity analyses using actual\nindustrial and electric utility data, and in helping to identify potential SPS\ndemonstration sites and applications.. Formulation of commercialization\nstrategies will benefit from and rely heavily on these market analysis\nresults.\n\n185\n\n'
