b"Innovation @ NASA\n\nNational Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration\n\nDr. Juan A. Rom\xc3\xa1n\nNASA/GSFC\n\nAbout NASA\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established in 1958\nby President Dwight D. Eisenhower encouraging peaceful applications in space\nscience. It\xe2\x80\x99s the United States government agency that is responsible for the civilian\nspace program as well as for aeronautics and aerospace research.\nSince its inception, NASA has accomplished many great scientific and technological\nfeats in air and space. NASA technology also has been adapted for many noneaerospace uses by the private sector.\nNASA remains a leading force in scientific research and in stimulating public interest\nin aerospace exploration, as well as science and technology in general.\n\n2\n\n2012\n\n3\n\nNASA Centers\n\n4\n\nOur Mission\n\n5\n\nMessage from Administrator\n\xe2\x80\x9cNASA's missions of the future are going to depend\non new technologies that will be evolvable and\napplicable across a broad range of missions. We\nare dedicated to extending human presence into\nthe solar system and to the surface of Mars, and\nnew technologies and advanced capabilities are\nessential to safely taking us from Earth-reliant to\nEarth-independent missions, and the surest path to\nan eventual crewed landing on Mars. Sustained\ninvestment in these technologies advances the\nagency's exploration capabilities and supports the\ninnovation economy.\xe2\x80\x9d June 3, 2014\n\n6\n\nInnovation @
