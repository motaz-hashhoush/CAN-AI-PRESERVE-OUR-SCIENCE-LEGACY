Thus, it may prove to be a\npromising area for collecting earthquake precursor data. (See Appendix II by Bilham and Beavan.)\nFor this reason, the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory has installed in this area geophysical\nmonitoring instruments such as tiltmeters, tide gauges, strain gauges, leveling lines and seismometers.\nMuch of these data are collected by resident caretakers and returned to Lamont by mail or courier.\nThis imposes an undesirable delay in analyzing the data, allows instrument breakdowns to exist\nfor some time before being discovered, and does not allow quick reaction responses to sudden\nchanges in geophysical parameters.\nIn 1976, Goddard entered into a joint project with Roger Bilham of Lamont to demonstrate\nthe feasibility of collecting low data rate (a few kilobits per day) information from Anegada using\nthe Landsat satellite relay system. The instruments for accomplishing this were essentially "off\nthe shelf," but specific Data Collection Platform (DCP)/geophysical instrument interfaces did not\nexist and satellite reliability from this area had not been proven. Real-time satellite relay is only\npossible when the satellite is in mutual view of both the transmitting station and the receiving\ncenter at Goddard. In order to relay transmissions from Anegada, the satellite is relatively close\nto the horizon at GSFC. This could have resulted in reliability problems.\nThe initial installation consisted of one General Electric (G.E.) DCP relaying tide gauge data.\nThe tide gauge.% DCP interface was jointly designed and constructed by Lamont and Goddard. The\n\nsystem, which was installed in May of 1976 by Roger Bilham of Lamont and William Webster of\nGoddard, performed satisfactorily for over a year until the batteries were depleted.\nIt was then decided that, using more versatile DCPs, data would be relayed back from the\nLamont tiltmeters on the island. We will dee:,,be the Goddard designed and built interface for\nthis system. The interface was used to tie the six tiltmeters into two LaBarge DCPs in October\n1977. This installation was made by Webster and Dee Breger and John Beavan of Lamont.\nThis paper discusses the systems engineering considerations involved, describes the specialpurpose equipment constructed and reviews the performance of the Landsat data collection system\nin this experiment. The scientific results of the experiment have been reviewed by Bilham and\nBeavan (1979).\n\nINITIAL ANEGADA EXPERIMENT\n\nThe initial experiment was designed to assess the extent of coverage of the Anegada area from\nthe Goddard tracking station. Although Anegada is essentially flat (maximum elevation 20 ft.\nabove sea level), the location of the Goddard Satellite Tracking and Data Acquisition Network\nStation (GSTDN) is such that the horizon is obscured by trees and hills to the south and cast.\nSince it is network practice to command spacecraft off while it is still possible to assure execution\nand to hold "on" commands until the main beam of the tracking antenna clears the horizon, it\nwas not possible to guarantee the extent of mutual visibility between GSTDN and Anegada.\nThe situation is illustrated in Figure 2. On a Mercator projection the intersections of the\napparent elevation circles form a series of lanes. in the interest of simplicity only the 0 0 elevation\nsemicircle is shown for Anegada (NNE-W segment) while the 0\xc2\xb0, S\xc2\xb0, and 10\xc2\xb0 semicircles are shown\nfor GSTDN. A relay is possible anytime Landsat is within the region enclosed by the semicircles.\nA typical pattern of ascending and descending node orbital tracks is also shown together with an\norbit yielding the maximum simultaneous visibility (10` n 301).\n\nzu\nr\nI\t\n\n..\n\nIn order to investigate the available coveragt\xc2\xb1 in practice, a DCP was deployed on the south\nside of the island (18 0 33:7N. 640 23:2W). The DCP was connected to a Lamont sea level recorder\n(Bilham 1977) through a voltage to frequency converter (VCO) and integrating counter interface\nconstructed at Lamont. The Lamont interface provided eight parallel digital words on latch integrated circuits (ICs) corresponding to the tide gauge voltage integrated over a 1% hour period.\nConventional CMOS logic was employed in the integrating counter and a low power VCO/Operational\nAmplifier IC was used for the voltage to frequency converter.\nA GE DCP was used for this initial experiment. A measured output of 12.2 watts into a\n50 ohm load was obtained at the rated input DC voltage (24V). In order to keep the antenna\nsize small enough to transport easily, a printed circuit bifrlar helix antenna manufactured by Chu\nAssociates was used. The battery pack consisted of four 744 Ampere-Hour (AH) gellcells and a\nbank of 1000 AH carbonaire aircell batteries. The gellcells acted as a buffer to the airceUs. This\ncombination was necessary because the 2 i ampere instantaneous current drain during transmissions\ncaused the input voltage to vary by 2+ volts from the unloaded output. When using aircells alone\nand the gellcells did not provide enough capacity. The gellcells acted as a regulator for the main\npower bus supplied by the carbonaire batteries.\nThe DCP proper was enclosed in a weather tight case and it and the VCO/counter assembly\nwere located in a shed at the yacn! anchorage at Flamingo Bay on the south side of the island.\nThe tide gauge used was one of two located at the lagoon and was connected to the interface by\na buried cable. In Figure 3, we plot the results of six months of coverage on the diagram of Figure 2. The dotted area shows the subsatellite points for which GSTDN received transmission\nthrough Landsat from Anegada. As expected, the northeast and southcentral quadrants of the\ncoverage diagram are empty. Figure 4 shows the tide gauge head and the shed where the DCP\nwas located while Figure 5 shows the antenna installation. Although the antenna cleared the\nsurrounding building by a comfortable margin (around 1-2 ft.). it was not practical to put the\nantenna high enough (an additional 8-10 ft.) to clear the surrounding palm trees. Since these\n\n3\n\ntrees were west-northwest of the antenna, the trees are responsible for the gap in coverage in the\nnorthwest quadrant.\nThe DCP system functioned for over a year (58 weeks) before the battery pack was depleted.\nFor the last 48 hours of operation, the successful relays per pass decreased dramatically (cut to\nV4\n\nnormal) due to drastically reduced transmitter output. It is typical of the depletion character-\n\nistics of carbonaire batteries that the end-of-life failure is abrupt. The 48 hour period probably\nrepresents the total discharge time of the geUceU buffer pack. The 58 weeks lifetime is about\n10% greater than predicted from the nominal battery capacity.\nData returned through the DCS were compared with strip-chart recordings made on-site.\nThe comparison showed no loss of quality in transmission. An example of the diurnal total variation is given in Figure 6. Because the Lamont tide gauges are intended to monitor the mean sea\nlevel, hydraulic damping is used to decrease the tidal amplitude (Bilham 1977). Thus, although all\nof the relative features of the tide at the Anegada yacht basin are apparent, the actual tide is much\nlarger than indicated. Relative changes in amplitude, both long short time scale changes, are\npreserved. however.\n\nTILTMETER RELAY SYSTEM\nThe success of the initial experiment encouraged us to proceed with Landsat r-.lay of the\ntiltmeter array installed by Lamont on Anegada. The tiltmeters used in the Lamont array have\ntwo orthogonal outputs and thus require two DCP channels per tiltmeter. In addition to the tiltmeter signals. it is also important to get a regular readout of the DCP battery condition. With the\nstorage characteristics of the DCP used in this experiment, this proved no problem.\nThe instrumentation used (i.e.. the tiltmeters and the DCPs) for the tiltmeter DCP system was\n"off-the-shelf." The two DCPs were manufactured by LaBarge, Inc. and are adaptable to either\nLandsat or the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). The tiltmeters were\nKinemethcs. Inc. borehole tiltmeters of the same design as used by the USGS. Menlo Park,\n\n4\n\nCA for their central California array (Mortenson and Johnston. 1975). Althnugh this instrumentation is of a conventional nature, the problem of interfacing the tiltmeters and the DCP did require\nsome sophisticated systems engineering considerations. The level of sophistication is not apparent\nfrom the simplicity of the actual interface.\nThe Lamont array was deployed along a 2 km baseline with each tiltmeter connected by cable\nto a antral recording station. Because of the long cable length, CMOS operational amplifiers were\nused to build the signal levels up to the requirements of the Lamont recorders. These amplifiers\nbecause of their high impedance also acted as impedance matching devices to the relatively low\nimpedance tiltmeter fines. Impedance transformation into the DCPs was required since the analog\nto digital converter (ADC) used in the DCP requires an input impedance of 10011 max.\n\nTILTMETER ARRAY SATELLITE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\nThe system consists of six tiltmeters with their associated electronics, an interface box, two\nData Collection Platforms (DCPs), and their related power sources and cabling. The latter parts\nof the system will be discussed in this document, with only a brief review of the tiltmeter output\ncharacteristics. The six tiltmeter, each having two orthogonal outputs, feed two DCPs.\nThis gives twelve channels of tiltmeter data. The four power sources for the tiltmeter and the\nDCPs were also monitored. Therefore, there is a total of sixteen channels of data. Each channel\nwas sampled four times a day and the data relayed by satellite twice a day through the Landsat\nsatellite. Data sequence tags were included in the data so that the relative time that each data\nsample was taken could be determined. It should be noted that the data was instantaneous and\nwas not arera gt, j over the time between samples. The data were stored in the DCP% until relayed\nto the satellite. The timing and sequence setup for the two DCPs is described in a later section\ndealing with the DCP initialization.\nThe output impedance of the tiltmeter system that drives the DCP interface circuits must not\nexceed 100 ohms due to the DCP ADC. T!:e output voltage should not exceed plus and minus\n\nseven (7) volts to avoid overdriving the ADC but -a sensitivity of 40 milli\xe2\x80\x94volts per microradian or\ntilt must be preserved since this is the intrinsic accuracy of the tiltmeters.\n\nInterface\nAll signal outputs to the DCPs are required to be 04 volts DC. The output of the tiltmeter is\nplus and minus seven (7) volts buffered by the op. amp. To interface there two units a circuit\nwas designed to insert a DC bias on the DCP input such that 0 volts from the tiltmeter would result in approximately 2.5 volts into the DCP (mid range). Since maximum sensitivity was desired\nwith a minimum loss in dynamic range the circuit was designed to preserve the sensitivity as much\nas possible using only passive components. The resultant output signal of the interface circuit\nrepresents approximately 34 microradians of tilt per volt of signal with a dynamic range of plus\nand minus 85 microradians. The DCP has an input sensitivity of approximately 20 millivolts per\ncount (one digit). This gives an overall sensitivity of at least 0.7 microradimis.\nThe tiltmeter power sources were approximately plus and minus 15 volts, Each was a bank\nof 1000 ampere\xe2\x80\x94hour carbonair cells. The positive supply was interfaced by a simple voltage\ndivider. This gives approximately 3.2 volts into the DCP for IS volts. The negative supply\nhad a DC bias inserted such that minus 15 volts results in approximately 2.0 volts into the DCP\nand any less negative voltage increases the input. The input to DCP goes to approximately S volts\nif the negativ- supply should go to zero. The DCP power sources are both plus 12 volts. These\nchannels are also used for a data sequence tag on the data. This channel (one for each DCP)\nalternately samples a voltage divider on the DCP power source and then ground. The sampling\ncontrol was done by a latching relay which is controlled by the switched 12 volts available from\nthe DCP. Details of this circuit are discussed later.\nThe overall cabling diagram is shown in Figure 7. This shows the cabiing harness which\nbrings the tiltmeter signal and tiltmeter power supply voltages from the tiltmeter array junction\nbox to the interface box, and from the interface box to the two DCPs. Also the power for the\nDCPs was handled by this harness.\n6\n\nThe interface electronics was packaged in a box which is approximately 10.5 x 8.0 x 7.Ocm.\nFigure 8 shows the arrangement of the nine cards within the box. The cards are designated TM-1.\nTM-\'-. TM-3, KY-1, PS, KY-2. TM-4, TM-5 and TM-6. Card TM-1 has the interface for tiltmeter\n*1 and so forth. Cards TM-1, TM-2, TM-3 am KY-1 are connected to DCP* 1, while cards KY-2,\nTM-4, TM-5 and TM-6 are connected to DCP*2. The center card (marked PS) is connected to\nboth DCP%, i.e., the positive supply interface is connected to DCPO1, and the negative supply\ninterface is connected to DCP*2. (Caution: if the cards teed to be removed from the box, the\ncable harness must be disconnected first to protect the DC?s, as well as the zener diodes on the\nTM cards.)\nThe plug for the interface box was mounted on one of the two covers to the box. The other\ncover could be removed during setup in the field. This cover had to be tightly replaced after\nthe setup procedure is finished to reform the environmental seal. It should be noted that certain\nbus wires are run along the back of the cards (the end toward the 50 pin connector). This will\nprevent removal of the cards from the front\n\nof\n\nthe box. Removal must be done from the rear\n\nconnector end as a group.\n\nSix of\n\nthe cards are for the tiltmeter interface circuits (see Fig. 9) and are designated by TM-*.\n\nEach card has the circuits for both the "X" and "Y" channels of the tiltmeter. Figure 10 shows\nthe circuit for the tiltmeter interfaces. The reference voltage (switched 12 volts) with its dropping\nresistor and zener diode is shared between the two interface circuits on the card. The potentiometers for zeroing the circuit (setting the output to 2.5 volts with zero volts in) are separate for\neach circuit. The result is: an input of approximately plus 3.4 volts, drives the output of the\ninterface to plus five volts; an input of approximately minus 3.4 volts will drive the output to\n0 volts. Any voltage beyond t.: .ae extremes is clamped by a diode to protect the DCP input\ncircuit.\n\n7\n\nOne card has the interface circuits for hoth\'the plus and minus power supplies for the tiltmeters lsee Fig. H) and is designated PS. Figure 12 shows the interface circuits. It should be\nnoted that this is the only card which had circuitry driving both DCK The positive supply inter\n&ce circuit drives channel 7 of DCP*I and the negative supply interface circuit drives channel 7\nof DCP*2.\nThe last two cards contain the DCP power supply monitoring and the data ut identification\nswitch for each DCP (see Fig. 13) and are designated by KY\xe2\x80\x94#. The circuit is shown in Figure\n14. The relay is a bistable relay and it changes state once each time the switched 12 volts power\nis applied. The switched 12 V is applied about 80 seconds prior to the actual sampling of data\nand remains on during the sampling of the data. Therefore. the relay changes state just prior to\neach sampling period and remains in that state until the next sampling period starts. The relay an\nbe set in either state during setup by applying +12 volts to either TP 1 or TP 2. it should be\nnoted that as the next sample period begins, the relay will change state. Care must be taken to\ninsure that the state of the relay is known at initialization of the DCPs. This an be accomplished\nby measuring the voltage on TP *3 during the sampling period.\n\nTiming and Sampling Sequence\nThe Landsat satellite passes within view of the island at least twice a day. That is, at\nleast once before noon and once before m+\'.dnight. During each pass, all the data collected\nby the system during the last two sampling periods can be relayed through the satellite.\nThis was accomplished by two consecutive transmissions of the DCPs. Each CCP transmits\nan average of once every 1.5 minutes whether or not the satellite is above the horizon.\nThus the DCP would send at least six consecutive transmissions per visible pass and the data\nare repeated at least three times during each of these passes. Since the data are sampled every six\nhours. two sets of data were taken between passes and are transmitted during the next pass. A\ndiagram of this sequence is shown in Figure 15. Each channel sampled results in one word stored\nin the memory of the DCP}\nF\n\n8\n\nAfter the first eight channels are sampled, the first eight words of data are stored in the DCP\nmemory. During the second sampling period another eight words are stored in the DCP memory,\ni.e., 16 words of data are stored for transmission. On a transmission, eight of the data words are\ntransmitted, and on the next transmission the second eight daia words are transmitted. This is\nrepeated over and over again until the next sampling period, when the first eight words are written\nover, i.e., destroyed and a new set of eight data words are substituted. On the next sampling period\nthe second eight words are updated. The sampling occurs every six hours and, therefore, both sets\nof data words are updated between passes. Although the DCP is transmitting new and old data in\nconsecutive transmission between sampling, the data is completely updated before the next satellite\npass.\nDifficulties on the island (Bilham and Beavan 19 79; see Appendix II) made it impossible to\nuse the entire tiltmeter array with the DCP system. Because of weather and animal damage, no\nmore than four tiltmeters were operational at any one time. Nonetheless, the system operated well\nfrom start up to completion of the expe,+nent in early 1979.\n\nREFERENCES\nBilham, R., 1977, A sea-level recorder for tectonic studies, Geo. J. R. Astr.

Carefully unpack all the equipment and inspect it for damage.\n2. Install the antennas and connect them to the DCPs using the cables provided.\n3. Place the batteries, as nearly as possible, in the location they will be used and activate them.\nRefer to Figure I.\n4. With the exception of the 12 volt batteries, connect the wire harness assembly to the DCPs,\nthe Interface Box, and the tiltmeter electronics as shown in Figure 1. Be sure that WG 1 is\nconnected to DCP 1 and WG 2 is connected to DCP 2. Refer to Table III to connect WG 3.\nThe number tags on WG 3 refer to J 1 pin numbers.\n5. Disconnect antenna cable from DCP 1.\n6. Remove dummy load from cover of test set and connect to DCP 1.\n7. Connect WG 4 to one of the 12 volt battery packs.\nNOTE: If 12 volt battery is removed from either DCP after preliminary programming,\nantenna must be replaced with dummy load and programming repeated.\n8. Set the test set switches as follows:\n(a) Set power switch to off.\n(b) Set memory switch to secure.\n9. Connect test set to DCP 1 with the cable provided.\n10. Set test set switches as follows:\n(a) Set power switch to on.\n(b) Set memory switch to access.\n\n1 1. Perform preliminary programming of DCP by entering constants into the DCP memory\naddresses as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nSet address thumb wheel switches to 01.\n\n(b) Set data thumb wheel switch to C.\n(c)\n\nDepress enter switch.\n\n(d) The data display lights should indicate a value of C hexadecimal.\n12. Refer to Table I and complete the preliminary programming, using the procedure outlined in\nstep 11.\n13. Initiate DCP I by setting test set switches as follows:\n(a)\n\nSet data switch to 0.\n\n(b)\n\nSet address switch to 00.\n\n(c)\n\nDepress timer reset switch twice within one second.\n\n(d)\n\nDepress enter switch.\n\n14. Set test set switches as follows:\n(a)\n\nSet memory switch to secure.\n\n(b) Set power switch to off.\n15. Disconnect test set from DCP 1.\n\n16. Disconnect dummy load from DCP 1.\n17. Connect antenna cable to DCP 1.\n18. Disconnect antenna cable from DCP 2.\n19. Connect dummy load to DCP 2.\n20. Connect WG S to the remaining 12 volt battery pack.\n1. Repeat steps 8 through 17 to perform preliminary programming of DCP\nthe following conditions should exist for both DCPs:\n\n1-^\n\n\'_.\n\nAt this point\n\nfa) A transmission should occur approximately every 180 seconds. The green RF power\nand modulation lights should go on momentarily when transmission occurs.\n(b) Data update should occur every six minutes, indicated by flashing of the amber data\ndata display lights.\n(c)\n\nBefore proceeding, at least 12 minutes should have passed since the DCPs were initiated,\nto ensure that the data memories contain a full data set.\n\n22. Repeat sets 8 through 10.\n23. Set address thumb wheel switches to 30 and record binary word indicated by data display\nlights.\n24. Repeat set 23 for memory location 31 through 3F for first sample data and also 40 through\n4F for second sample data.\n25. Refer to Table I and enter final program constants for DCP 1. Check all address locations that\nare used to ensure that they contain the correct constants.\n26. Set timer for proper update times by depressing the timer reset two times within one second.\nThe second timer reset switch actuation must be executed at a desired update time, namely,\n5:00, 11:00, 17:00 or 23:00 GMT.\n27. Perform final initialization of DCP i by setting test set switches as follows:\n(a) Set data switch to 0.\n(b) Set address switch to 00.\n(c)\n\nDepress enter switch.\n\nStep 27 must be performed within 180 seconds of step 26 to ensure proper data\nmanagement.\n28. Set test set switches as follows:\n(a) Set memory switch to secure.\n(b) Set power switch to off.\n\nI-3\n\n29. Disconnect test set from DCP 1 and connect it to DCP \'_.\n30. Set test set switches as follows:\n(a) Set power switch to on.\n(b) Set memory switch to access.\n31. Repeat set 23 and 24.\n32. Refer to Table I and enter final program constants for DCP 2. Check all address locations\nthat are used to ensure that they contain the correct constants.\n33. Repeat step 26 through 28.\n34. Disconnect test set from DCP 2.\n\nField Verification of Interface Calibration\nNOTE: Step 1 through 7 must be performed for both DCPs.\n1. Refer to Table II and convert the data, obtained in steps 23 and 24, to interface output\nvoltages.\nExample:\n(a) Write the data from memory addresses 30 and 31 in binary form. Remember 30 contains the LSB and 31 to MSB.\n\t\n31\n\t\nMSB 1000\n\n30\n0011 LSB\n\n(b) Convert to decimal, 1 plus 2 plus 128 equals 131.\n(c) Multiply by 5%256 or 0.195 131 times 0.0195 equals _.558 volts.\n\'\n_\'. Figure 11 was compiled with the DCP battery + voltage set at 12:00; volts. Any change in this\nvoltage (as the battery discharges) will change the interface outputs, therefore, in the data\nconversion process it will be necessary to determine the DCP battery voltage at the tim: of\ndata sampling and use Table IV t:) obtain the value to be added to or subtracted from the\ninterface output signals stored in the data memory. This is accomplished as follows:\n1-4\n\n(a)\n\nlasing the procedure outlined in step l,\'convert data word 8, from binary to analog.\nThe tirst sample is in 3E and 3F, the second sample is in 4E and 4F. One sample will\nbe zero and the other will represent the 12 V DCP battery.\n\n(b) Refer to Figure III and convert value obtained in (a) above to the battery voltages level.\n(c)\n\nRefer to Table IV and determine the value to be added to or subtracted from interface\nvalue for data words 1 through 6.\n\n3. Correct the value obtained in step 1 for data words 1 through 6 by adding or subtracting\nthe value obtained in step 2.\n4. Refer to Figure II and convert data words 1 through 6 to actual tiltmeter voltages.\nS. Refer to Figure IV and convert data word 7 to a plus or minus 15 volts battery level depending on which DCP is being checked.\n6. Measure the analog voltages listed in the Function column of Table II.\nNOTE: All tiltmeter x and y axis outputs as well as the plus and minus 15 volt battery\nvoltages are available in the tiltmeter array junction box. The +12 V switched from\nDCP 1 and DCP 2 can be measured on the back side of card K 1 and K2, respectively,\n(The points are labeled.)\n7. Compare the value measured in step 6 with the value contained in step 1 for the +12 V DCP\nbattery, step 3 for the tiltmeter outputs, and step 4 for the plus or minus 15 volt tiltmeter\nbattery.\n\n1-5\n\nTable I\n\nProgram Constants for DCPs\nInitial DCP*1\n\nAddress\n\nFinal\n\nInitial DCP*2\n\nFinal\n\n01\n02\n03\n04\n\nC\n1\n6\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nC\n1\n6\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nC\n1\n7\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nC\n1\n7\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nOA\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nOB\nOC\nOD\nOE\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n8\n\n1\n\nOF\n\n1\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\n10\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n*\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n8\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n8\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n*Not used value does not matter\n\n0 o o o 0\n1\t\n0 0 0 *\no0\'o\n2\t\n3\t\no o * .\n\t\n4\t\no * o o\t\n5\t\nr o*\no\n6\t\n7\t\n8\t\n9\t\nA\t\n\nB\t\n\n* - light ison\n\n0 * \xe2\x80\xa2 0\n0 * * *\n\n" o * *\n\nC\t\nD\t\n\no - light is off\n\n* * o o\n* \' o\n\n* o o o\n* o o *\n* o \' o\n\n* w w ^\nF\t\n\n.\n\n..\n\n.\n\n1-6\n\n2\n\nF\n\nTable 11\nData Addresses and Sample Reduction\nAddress\n2nd Sample\n\n1 st Simple\n\nDCP\n\nFunction\n\nmsb\n\nData Address\t\nPannel Lights\t\nMultiplier\t\nSample data\t\n\nlsb\n\n31\n33\n\n30\n32\n\n41\n43\n\n40\n42\n\n1\n1\n\n35\n37\n\n34\n36\n\n45\n47\n\n44\n46\n\n1\n1\n\n39\n3B\n\n38\n3A\n\n49\n4B\n\n48\n4A\n\n2\n2\n\n31\n33\n\n30\n32\n\n41\n43\n\n40\n42\n\n2\n\n35\n37\n\n34\n36\n\n45\n47\n\n44\n46\n\n2\n\'-\n\n39\n3B\n\n38\n3A\n\n49\n4B\n\n48\n4A\n\n1\n\'1\n\n8\t\n128\t\n1\t\n\nmsb\n\n1\n1\n\nTiltmeter #1\nX axis\nY axis\nTiltmeter #2\nX axis\nY axis\nTiltmeter #3\nX axis\nY axis\nTiltmeter #4\nX axis\nY axis\nTiltmeter #5\nX axis\nY axis\nTiltmeter #6\nX axis\nY axis\nTiltmeter power\npositive\nnegative\nDCP #1 power\nDCP #2 power\n\nlsb\n\n3D\n3D\n3F\n3F\n\n3C\n3C\n3E\n3E\n\n4D\n4D\n4F\n4F\n\n4C\n4C\n4E\n4E\n\nmsb\t\n2\t\n4\t\n64\t 32\t\n0\t\n0\t\n\nIsb\n8 4 2\t\n8\t 4\t 2\t\n1\t\n0\t\n0\t\n\n1\t\n16\t\n1\t\n\ntimes\t\n\nMagic NLIMbrr (5 divided by 256)\t\nInput Voltage to DCP\t\n\n1 -7\n\n1\n1\n1\nI\n4\n16\n+ 1,\n149\n0.019531\n2 .9 10 volts\n\nTabu III\nTo\n\nFrom\nWire\nGroup\n\nWG 1\n\nJ1\n\nModule or\nHousing\nPinmating\nConnector\n\nWire\nGroup\nConnector\n2\n\nInterface Box P1\n\nJ-101\n\nor\nHousing\nPinmating\nConnector\n\nWire\nGroup\nConnector\nj\n\nDCP 1\n\nSignal\n\nTM I X Out\n\n4\n\nm\n\nTM 2 X Out\n\n6\n\nAA\n\nTM 3 X Out\n\n7\n\nP\n\nGrnd\n\n18\n\nA\n\n+12 V Switched\n\n34\n\nz\n\nTM 1 Y Out\n\n36\n\nN\n\nTM 2 Y Out\n\n38\n\nT\n\nTM 3 Y Out\n\n40\n\nn\n\nKY I\n\nWG 1\n\nJ\t 1\n\n43\n\nInterface Box P1\n\nJ-101\n\nU\n\nDCP 1\n\n+15 V P.S.

The tiltmeter\nmeasurements after two years of undisturbed operation indicate a tilt rate of approximately a\nmicroradian per month, whereas the precision levelling indicates that the island is stable to within\na microradian per year (1976-1978). Variations in sea level appear to affect the tiltmeters coherently. although tidal tilts vary significantly over 400m distances.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThere has been much discussion concerning the fidelity of short\xe2\x80\x94baseline tiltmeters installed\nnear the Earth\'s surface because there tare no published results that can be considered totally beyond\nsuspicion. That is, redundancy and duplication of tiltmeters is rare and coherence of tilt signals is\nfrequently poor even over distances of kilometers. Long\xe2\x80\x94term measurements of tilt do not agree\nwith absolute measurements using independent methods such as levelling. Tiltmeters respond to\nrainfall, changes in subsurface hydrology and surface temperature and it is usually difficult to exclude some or all of these noise sources as a possible source of observed signals.\nMoreover. the generation of tilts can occur through the interaction of local elastic inhomogeneity and applied strainfields. Hence, tilt amplitudes and phases can be distorted even if instruments are of adequately good fidelity. These secondary problems cannot be studied systematically\nwithout tint demonstrating tiltfield coherence.\n\nl-1\n-\n\nIt was decided. therefore, that six of the Kinemetrics borehole instruments would be installed sufficiently close to each other to examine the wavelengths of surface tilt and that additional\ndifferent tiltmeters and measurements would be introduced to provide an independent evaluation\nof the real tilt of the area.\n\nLOCATION OF THE EXPERIMENT\nThe experiment was set up on Anegada in the British Virgin Islands (Fig. 1). The Virgin\nIslands have not experienced a major earthquake in the last 500 years of recorded history but\nthere is reason to believe that a major earthquake may be overdue because regions to the west and\nsouth have experienced earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 7. An alternative explanation of\nthe gap in significant seismic energy release may be that strain energy is released in the form of\ncreep or as "slow" or "silent" earthquakes with a large component of long-period energy (minutes\nto days) and relatively high little frequency energy. The installation of strainmeters or tiltmeters\nwas considered to be a possible means to provide an insight into the two alternative tectonic\nmechanisms or others that might be involved. Anegada was chosen to site the array since it is\nessentially horizontal, low-lying, and surrounded by a shallow shelf. Approximately four microearthquakes a day are detected by the Lamont-Doherty Caribbean Seismic Network and there is\nabout one magnitude 4 earthquake a month. The residents on Anegada feel one or two earthquakes\na year, which appear to be centered about 20km to the NW of the island.\n\nGEOGRAPHY OF ANEGADA REGION\nAnegada Island measures approximately 16 km east-west by 3 km north-south. The central\nand eastern parts of the island are surfaced by partly recrystallized coral reef, calcarenites and\ncalcareous sand which nowhere attain a height of more than 9m above meaik sea level. The western\npart of the island is a layer of sand which thickens westward to a maximum of 10m depth and\nwhich rarel y exceeds 2m ,\'Uove sea level except in the form of wind-blown dunes. The western\narea has a series of salt ponds that drain poorly to the sea. The eastern part of the island consists\nI\n\n!t\n\nf;\n\n_\t\n\n.\n\nof interleaved horizontal layers of calcarenite and coral with a vertical spacing of about 1\n\nin\n\nlavers. Borehole information does not exist below 20m.\nThe island is fringed by coral reefs. To the north the shelf drops steeply toward the Puerto\nRico trench and to the east to the Anegada trough. To the south and west the sea floor is uniformly shallow (about 10m) across to the islands of St. Thomas and Tortolla. Three or four submerged terraces wit , a vertical spacing of 3-4m have been identified to the south of Anegada and\nHoward (1970) argues that this signifies stages of geological uplift.\nIn 1797 Anegada was marked by Captain Waring (1797) on a map as the "drowned island"\nbeing "almost entirely covered at spring tide." This "drowning" may have referred to the western\nhalf of the island which is now at least 50cm above the highest tide. If we assume that no other\nprocess is operating, the difference between Captain Waring\'s map and the present implies an emergence of approxiamtely 1 to 3mm/year. A more probable mechanism is that the present surface is\nthe product of sedimentation. The rapid erosion and rebuilding of the westerly tip of Anegada\noccurs presently during storm conditions although it is clearly restricted by the reef. According to\nadmiralty charts made in 1890 and more recently, shallowing of the sea floor to the south by about\n1 m has occurred. This is interpreted as sediment influx and although it is clear that sediment\ntransport from west to east occurs, it is uncertain where such quantities of sand come from.\nStudies by Schomburgk 0832) and by developers more recently show large quantities of fresh\nwater underlying the island. The general porosity of the island u as revealed by two experiments\nwe performed in 1976. A series of wells up to 90m from the beach at the west end encountered\nbrackish water right up to the beach with a periodic modul,.tion of height caused by the 30em sea\ntide. The amplitude of the periodic effect fell off rapidly to about 30` 7r of the tidal amplitude\nin the first 10m and then less than 517c for the next 100m. A well 1.5km from the coast shows\na 5 cm tide.\n\n11-3\n\ni\n\nTILTMETERS\nIn 1976 we installed six Kinemterics tiltmeters in boreholes in a 2 km array along the island.\nOur intention was to examine the nature of island tilt noise and the suitability of using borehole\ntiltmeters in island-arc deformation studies. Operating problems in the first two years of installation encouraged us to reduce the array dimensions to a more modest array of three instruments\n(numbered 2, 3, and 4 on Fig. 4). The details of our initial installation are to be found in the\nFinal Report to USGS contract 14-08-0001-6371. An important feature of the tiltmeter installation is that the tiltmeters were encased in sand-filled 7.5 cm diameter, 3m long aluminum tubes\nbefore being lowered into 15 cm diameter, 3 m auger holes in the coral. The tiltmeter electronics\nare augmented by a servo-system for maintaining the tiltmeters close to zero output, by a local\nrecording system, and by a centrally located satel:ite transmitter (DCP). Each installation is covered\nby a 1 m high mound of white sand canopied by an elevated sheet roof to minimize the direct\neffects of sun and rain. The installation method successfully reduces thermal contamination of\nthe tilt data to an acceptable level (see Fig. 2).\nThe local chart recorder at each tiltmeter is multiplexed to monitor the x and y tilt channels\nand the output from a thermistor thermometer positioned within the electronics unit. The chart\nis advanced at a rate of approximately 5 cm per day. The tilt data are dominated at high frequencies (3-6s) by microseismic tilt that has its origin in surf action on the surrounding reefs.\nThe microseismic noise varies in amplitude from 0.1 to 0.3 microradians according to surf conditions. The telemetered data are smoothed with a 20s filter to attenuate the microseismic energy,\nsampled every six hours on six channels and transmitted twice daily.\nDuring the first two years of operation the signals from the six tiltmeters were greater than\n10- 5 radians per month in random directions. By 1978 the drift rate had reduced to approximately\n10\' b radians in a month. The observed decay in the drift rate is presumably due to settling of the\ninstrument and may be an elastic adjustment of the borehole tiltmeter casing in response to installation stresses ( Stauder and Morrissey 1978).\n\nII-4\n\nWe present two figures iliustrating recent da4a. In Figure 2, synchronous data from tiltmeters\nand 3 are shown. The x and y channels of tiltmeter 2 show a clear semidiurnal tide with a peakto-peak amplitude of 1-2 microradians. The y channel of tiltmeter 3 shows a diurnal thermal\nsignal with an amplitude of 4 microradians and the x channel suggests a semidiurnal tide with an\namplitude of less than 0.5 microradians. The microseismic tilt amplitude is approximately the same\namplitude on 2x, 2y, and 3y but is about half th t on channel 2x. Three teleseismic earthquakes\nconfirm that the calibration of 2y and 3y are wimin 20% of each other in that surface wave\nmagnitudes recorded by each are similar. We view the tiltmeter 2 data with suspicion since the\ntidal amplitudes are larger than we might expect from tidal loading and may be the result of direct\ninfluence of semidiurnal variations of hydraulic pressure (Van der Kamp 1973). Tiltmeter 2 is the\ndeepest operating tiltmeter and is less than 1 in\n\n\t mean sea level. Curiously, 1976 data from\n\nthis instrument showed a dominant diurnal thermal variation although its absence in recent data\nmay be the result of an improved surface cover. On the other 5 tiltmeters the maximum semidiurnal tide peak-to-peak amplitude has not exceeded 0.5 microradians. The thermal signal\napparent on the tilt data vies in amplitude from I to 5 micromdians. Much of this signal is the\ndirect effect of temperature on the electronics unit.\nIn Figure 3 we plot data obtained via satellite between March and July 1978 together with\nrainfall and sea-level data. Tiltmeter 2 behaves erratically and eventually fails when its negative\npower line is severed by a goat. Tiltmeters 3 and 4 show an interesting correspondence with sea\nlevel. Inflections in tilt and sea level occur at similar times. The sea-level data follow each other\nfor the period plotted but the tiltmeter data have different trends on all channels.\n\nPRECISION SURVEYING\nA 2.5 km levelling line was laid out in 1976 consisting of 38 benchmarks in an approximately\nE-W line along the tiltmeter array. In 1977 the fine was extended to the north. Brass levelling\npins were cemented into the coral surface at intervals of 40-100m. although the majority were\n\nI1-5\n\nspaced at 70m interval.. Cairns were constructed to locate the mid-paints of every measurement\npair to within 50cm. We used matched invar rods and a Zeiss Nit level with optical micrometer\nfor the measurements. A reading precision of 0.1 mm can be obtained with this equipment.\nThe levelling line has been measured five times in two years (Fig. 4). We adopted standard\nfirst-order levelling procedures for the measurements with one addition; where the outgoing and\nreturn levelling measurements for an adjacent pair of bench-marks differed bN more than 0.3 mm\nthey were repeated the following day. Normally such errors were attributable to a dust particle\non one or another of the benchmarks during a previous measurement. The closure errors for the\nfive outward and return levelling runs vary between 0.3mm and 1.4mm, that is, within the 1.6mm\nerror defined as "first order levelling" (e.g., Bomford 1971). In most cases the errors were less\nthan the t0.6mm we estimated as the cumulative reading error for the line.\nThe island tilt tide may be a significant source of systematic error since it has a measured\ndaily peak-to-peak amplitude of up to 2 x 10-6 radians. Surveying was usually done over a period\nof six hours in the morning and two in the early evening. The whole line was usually surveyed\nover a period of two days. Consider two extreme possibilities. In a period of six hours the tilt\ntide could tilt the surface from +l \xc2\xb5rad to -1 Arad or it could tilt from zero, t 1 \xc2\xb5rad to zero. In\nthe first instance, a cumulative tilt of 2,urad would be measured, in the second instance, no tilt\nwould be measured. Note that none of our measurements result in more than a I Arad tilt for the\nwhole lLie but that there are slopes within the line that may be the result of tidal changes of tilt\nduring the measurements. We plan to try to correct the levelling data for the island tilt tide using\nthe borehole tiltmeter measurements.\n\nSEA-LEVEL MEASUREMENTS\nA number of measurements of mean sea level are being made on the island and other nearby\nislands (Fig. 1 and Billiam 1977). On Anegada we are currently operating three sea-level monitors:\nat the west end. on the NL coast. and in a water well near the center of the island. The latter\n\nl I\xe2\x80\x94b\n\ninstniment shows a 5cm tide and longer period oscillations that closely follow sea-level variations\nmonitored by the other gauges. The two coastal sea-level monitors are installed on the bea.h and\nmonitor the water table rather than sea level. This experimental arrangement was adopted in order\nto avoid a direct connection to the sea that we have found vulnerable to vandalism and erosion.\nThe arrangement appears to be effective an Anegada since all three gauges track each other (Fig. 3).\nLong-period changes of sea level are detected by the tiltmeters and can account for some of the inflections in tilt rate observed by the array. Rainfall does not have any obvious effect on either\nthe sea level or tiltmeter data.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe tidal tilt of Anegada observed by borehole tiltmeters appears to vary over a relatively\nshort distance (400m) by a factor of four. The maximum measured value for daily tilt (21jrad) is\nsufficiently large to disturb precise geodetic levelling surveys of the island, although the data we\npresent do not appear to be seriously disturbed. This may be due to fortuitous timing of the outward and return surveys used to derive a mean value for the line or it may be due to a systematic\nerror in the tiltmeter measurements. We intend to process the levelling data more carefully to\nremove the known tilt tide.\nAn error analysis on the numerical values obtained for each adjacent pair of levelling pins provides a surprisingly low cumulative error estimate; t0.6mm in 2.5km. This is approximately three\ntimes smaller than the maximum permissible error required in normal precision levelling although\nit has been attained by other investigators (e.g., Schellens 1965). An earthquake (M r = 5) occurred\non 15 Oct. 1476. _0 km to the NW of Anegada. The tiltmeter array was inoperative at the time\nbut the levelling line showed no change (*2 x I rr 7 ) when it was resurveyed nine days later. Over a\nperiod of two years there appears to he a suggestion of a tilt up to the NE amounting to 0.5\nmicroradians. Since this value is barely above the estimated measurement precision and we are not\nhet certain of the influence of tilt tides on the island. we do not place much confidence on its\nsignificance.\n11-7\n\nThe long-term tilt rate (- 10"rad!month) seen by the tiltmeters even after two years from\ninstallation is approximately an order of magnitude larger than that established by precision\nlevelling. Some inflections in the tilt rate can be accounted for by sea-level variations around and\nunder the island. The levelling data indicate that it may be possible to install a long baseline tiltmeter on the surface between two selected levelling pins to obtain a stability of at least 10\'6\nradians per year. This would represent a significant improvement in the continuous monitoring\nof surface tilt on the island.\n\nWe have observed nothing suggestive of a "slow" earthquake on the data though this may\nhave occurred during the numerous occasions when the tiltmeters were inoperative. The seismograph network operated by this observatory has revealed a complex pattern of earthquakes\nwith magnitudes from -1 to 5 in the Anegada region (Murphy, et al., 1978). Our measurements\ndo not clarify the mechanism of plate collision in this corner of the Caribbean. A longer span of\ndata may help and so would continuous tilt measurements of improved fidelity.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank the Geophysics Applications Group of NASA, Captain Ira Smith,\nEarle Vanterpool. and George Anthony Smith for help in various aspects of this study.
