Although perhaps of limited practical value, the three meteorites with known orbits are all ordinary chondrites. To identify, in general, the taxonomic type of the parent asteroid, however, would be of great scientific interest since these most abundant meteorite types cannot be unambiguously spectrally matched to an asteroid type. The H5 Pribram meteorite and asteroid 4486 (unclassified) are not part of a stream, but travel in fairly similar orbits. The LL5 Innisfree meteorite is orbitally similar to asteroid 1989DA (unclassified), and both are members of a fourth stream (delta) defined by five meteorite-dropping fireballs and this one asteroid. The H5 Lost City meteorite is orbitally similar to 1980AA (S type), which is a member of stream gamma defined by four asteroids and four fireballs. Another asteroid in this stream is classified as an S type, another is QU, and the fourth is unclassified. This stream suggests that ordinary chondrites should be associated with S (and/or Q) asteroids. Two of the known four V type asteroids belong to another stream, beta, defined by five asteroids and four meteorite-dropping (but unrecovered) fireballs, making it the most probable source of the eucrites. The final stream, alpha, defined by five asteroids and three fireballs is of unknown composition since no meteorites have been recovered and only one asteroid has an ambiguous classification of QRS. If this stream, or any other as yet undiscovered ones, were found to be composed of a more practical material (e.g., water or metalrich), then recovery of the associated meteorites would provide an opportunity for in-hand analysis of a potential near-Earth resource.", "title": "Asteroid/meteorite streams", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:40:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910016724, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Drummond, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Arizona Univ.", "location": "Tucson, AZ, United States"}}, "id": "b29dc4760c3f4147a428f8975eaab083"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910016724, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910016724, "id": "b6658e4251f840eab7bd084d6d9fd075", "publicationName": "Resources of Near-Earth Space: Abstracts", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19910016705, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Resources of Near-Earth Space: Abstracts", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
