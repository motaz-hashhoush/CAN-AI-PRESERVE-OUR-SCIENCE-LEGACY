Because motivation was determined to be the greatest single factor force in inducing a company to invest in a high risk venture, the relative impact of alternative government programs and policies on personal and financial motivations were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to ascertain the effect on these programs and policies on photovoltaic industrialization. The government alternatives are ranked on the basis of their ease of implementation and their probable effect. The recommended sequence in which government policies would be applied to maximize the industrialization of the photovoltaic venture is discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790004799, "id": "a5d19d636c6f4f82a5ade215a624d43a", "publicationDate": "1978-08-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790004799.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790004799/downloads/19790004799.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790004799/downloads/19790004799.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790004799/downloads/19790004799.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
