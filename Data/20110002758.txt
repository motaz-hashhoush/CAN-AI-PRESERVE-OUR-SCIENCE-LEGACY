The quadrangle contains\nthe northernmost portion of western Eistla\nRegio and the Sedna Planitia lowlands. Sedna\nPlanitia consists of low-lying plains units,\nwith numerous small volcanic edifices including shields, domes and cones. The quadrangle\nalso contains several tholi, the large flowfield Neago Fluct\xc5\xabs, the Manzan-Gurme\nTesserae, and Zorile Dorsa and Karra-m\xc4\x81hte\nFossae which run NW-SE through the southwestern part of the quadrangle. There are six\ncoronae in the quadrangle (Table 1), the largest of which is Nissaba (300 km x 220 km),\nand there are fourteen impact craters (Table\n2).\n\nLat.\n\n25.6\n\n336.0\n\n13.5\n\nTable 1.

All types of material units occur throughout the quadrangle,\nwith the exception of tessera materials, which\ncrop out only in the eastern part of the\nmapped region.\nHighly deformed materials that have\nbeen mapped as tessera (unit t) range in size\nfrom < 50 km to several hundreds of kilometers across, and include the Manzan-Gurme\nTesserae which are made up of several indi-\n\nType\n\nConcentric\n\n9\n\nThe geologic history of the V-19 quadrangle is dominated by multiple episodes of\nplains formation and wrinkle ridge formation\ninterspersed in time and space with edificeand corona-related volcanism. The formation\nof Eistla Regio to the southwest of this quadrangle postdates most of the mapped plains\nunits, causing them to be deformed by wrinkle ridges and overlaid by corona and volcano\nflow units.\n\nvidual outcrops distributed along the eastern\nedge of this quadrangle.\nSeven plains materials units have been\nmapped in V-19 (from oldest to youngest):\nSedna deformed plains material (unit pdS),\nSedna patchy plains material (unit ppS),\nSedna composite-flow plains material (unit\npcS), Sedna homogeneous plains material\n(unit phS), Sedna uniform plains material\n(unit puS), Sedna mottled plains material\n(unit pmS) and Sedna lobate plains material\n(unit plS). These seven units range from relatively localized, limited extent units (e.g. unit\npdS) to more regional plains units (e.g. unit\nphS). Each of the mapped plains units are\ncomposed of groups of many smaller plains\nunits of varying age. These smaller plains\nunits have been grouped into a mappable unit\nbecause of their similarity in appearance and\nstratigraphic position relative to other plains\nunits. The regional-scale plains unit (unit\nphS) dominates the northeastern half of the\nmap. The dominance of this regional-scale\nplains unit is similar to other mapped quadrangles on Venus [1, 2]. The remaining plains\nunits, units pcS, pdS, ppS, puS, pmS and plS,\ntend to crop out as isolated patches of materials.\nThe V-19 quadrangle contains a variety of mappable volcanic landforms including\ntwo shield volcanoes (Evaki Tholus and Toci\nTholus) and the southern portion of a large\nflow field (Neago Fluct\xc5\xabs). A total of sixteen\nunits associated with volcanoes have been\nmapped in this quadrangle, with multiple\nunits mapped at Sif Mons, Sachs Patera and\nNeago Fluct\xc5\xabs. An oddly textured, radarbright flow is also mapped in the Sedna\nplains, which appears to have originated from\na several hundred kilometer long fissure. The\nsix coronae within V-19 have a total of eighteen associated flow units. Several edifice\nfields are also mapped, in which the small\nvolcanic edifices both predate and postdate\nthe other units. Impact crater materials are\nalso mapped.\n\nConclusions: V-19 is comparable with our\npreviously mapped quadrangles, V-39, V-46,\nV-28 and V-53 [3, 4, 5 and 6]. V-19, V-39\nand V-46 have a similar number of mapped\nplains units, whereas V-28 and V-53 have a\ngreater number. V-19, V-28 and V-53 are\nsimilar to one another in that all three quadrangles have very horizontal stratigraphic columns, as limited contact between units prevents clear age determinations. This does not\nmean that all units within each quadrangle\nformed at the same time. Rather, the stratigraphic columns reflect the limited nature of\nour stratigraphic knowledge in these quadrangles, allowing for numerous possible geologic histories. This uncertainty is illustrated\nby the use of hachured columns for each unit.\nResurfacing in these quadrangles is on the\nscale of 100s of square kilometers, consistent\nwith the fact that they lie in the most volcanic\nregion of Venus.\nReferences: [1] Bender, K.
