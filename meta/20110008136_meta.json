Over the next three months, the spacecraft was raised from its launch orbit into its final geosynchronous orbit and its systems and instruments were tested and calibrated in preparation for its desired ten year science mission studying the Sun. A great deal of activity during this time involved the spacecraft attitude control system (ACS); testing control modes, calibrating sensors and actuators, and using the ACS to help commission the spacecraft instruments and to control the propulsion system as the spacecraft was maneuvered into its final orbit. This paper will discuss the chronology of the SDO launch and commissioning, showing the ACS analysis work performed to diagnose propellant slosh transient and attitude oscillation anomalies that were seen during commissioning, and to determine how to overcome them. The simulations and tests devised to demonstrate correct operation of all onboard ACS modes and the activities in support of instrument calibration will be discussed and the final maneuver plan performed to bring SDO on station will be shown. In addition to detailing these commissioning and anomaly resolution activities, the unique set of tests performed to characterize SDO's on-orbit jitter performance will be discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20110008136, "endDate": "2011-02-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "American Astronautical Society Guidance and Control Conference", "location": "Breckenridge, CO", "id": "f0dc54c6632142be91702358df73d04e", "startDate": "2011-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110008136, "id": "c759032d272f4363b1fa4bdfa3ad855c", "publicationDate": "2011-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110008136.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110008136/downloads/20110008136.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110008136/downloads/20110008136.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110008136/downloads/20110008136.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
