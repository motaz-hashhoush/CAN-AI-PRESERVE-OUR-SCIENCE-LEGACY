b'Mechanics/Machinery\nModular, Rapid Propellant Loading System/Cryogenic Testbed\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nThe Cryogenic Test Laboratory (CTL)\nat Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has designed, fabricated, and installed a modular, rapid propellant-loading system to\nsimulate rapid loading of a launch-vehicle composite or standard cryogenic\ntank. The system will also function as a\ncryogenic testbed for testing and validating cryogenic innovations and ground\nsupport equipment (GSE) components.\nThe modular skid-mounted system is capable of flow rates of liquid nitrogen\nfrom 1 to 900 gpm (\xe2\x89\x883.8 to 3,400\nL/min), of pressures from ambient to\n225 psig (\xe2\x89\x881.5 MPa), and of temperatures to \xe2\x80\x93320 \xc2\xb0F (\xe2\x89\x88\xe2\x80\x93195 \xc2\xb0C). The system\ncan be easily validated to flow liquid oxygen at a different location, and could be\neasily scaled to any particular vehicle interface requirements.\n\nThis innovation is the first phase of development of a smart Simulated Rapid\nPropellant Loading (SRPL) system that\ncan be used at multiple sites for servicing\nmultiple vehicle configurations with varying interface flow, temperature, and pressure requirements. The SRPL system can\naccommodate cryogenic components\nfrom \xc2\xbc to 8 in. (\xe2\x89\x880.6 to 20 cm) and larger,\nand a variety of pneumatic component\ntypes and sizes. Temperature, pressure,\nflow, quality, and a variety of other sensors\nare also incorporated into the propellant\nsystem design along with the capability to\nadjust for the testing of a multitude of sensor types and sizes.\nThe system has three modules (skids)\nthat can be placed at any launch vehicle\nsite (or mobile), and can be connected\nwith virtually any length of pipe re-\n\nquired for a complete propellant loading system. The modules include a storage area pump skid (located near the\nstorage tank and a dump basin), a valve\ncontrol skid (located on or near the\nlaunch table to control flow to the vehicle, and to return to the tank or dump\nbasin), and a vehicle interface skid (located at the vehicle). The skids are fully\ninstrumented with pressure, temperature, flow, motor, pump controls, and\ndata acquisition systems, and can be controlled from a control room, or locally\nfrom a PDA (personal digital assistant)\nor tablet PC.\nThis work was done by Walter Hatfield, Sr.\nand Kevin Jumper of ASRC Aerospace Corp. for\nKennedy Space Center.

KSC-13460\n\nCompact, Low-Force, Low-Noise Linear Actuator\nThis actuator has potential uses in military and automotive applications.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nActuators are critical to all the robotic\nand manipulation mechanisms that are\nused in current and future NASA missions, and are also needed for many other\nindustrial, aeronautical, and space activities. There are many types of actuators\nthat were designed to operate as linear or\nrotary motors, but there is still a need for\nlow-force, low-noise linear actuators for\nspecialized applications, and the disclosed\nmechanism addresses this need.\nA simpler implementation of a rotary\nactuator was developed where the end effector controls the motion of a brush for\ncleaning a thermal sensor. The mechanism uses a SMA (shape-memory alloy)\nwire for low force, and low noise. The linear implementation of the actuator incorporates a set of springs and mechanical hard-stops for resetting and fault\ntolerance to mechanical resistance. The\nactuator can be designed to work in a\npull or push mode, or both. Depending\non the volume envelope criteria, the actuator can be configured for scaling its\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, September 2012\n\nvolume down to 4\xc3\x972\xc3\x971 cm3. The actuator\ndesign has an inherent fault tolerance to\nmechanical resistance. The actuator has\nthe flexibility of being designed for both\nlinear and rotary motion. A specific configuration was designed and analyzed\nwhere fault-tolerant features have been\nimplemented. In this configuration, an\nexternally applied force larger than the\ndesign force does not damage the active\ncomponents of the actuator. The actuator housing can be configured and produced using cost-effective methods such\nas injection molding, or alternatively, its\ncomponents can be mounted directly on\na small circuit board.\nThe actuator is driven by a SMA -NiTi\nas a primary active element, and it requires energy on the order of 20 Ws(J)\nper cycle. Electrical connections to points\nA and B are used to apply electrical\npower in the resistive NiTi wire, causing a\nphase change that contracts the wire on\nthe order of 5%. The actuation period is\nof the order of a second for generating\n\nthe stroke, and 4 to 10 seconds for resetting. Thus, this design allows the actuator\nto work at a frequency of up to 0.1 Hz.\nThe actuator does not make use of the\nwhole range of motion of the SMA material, allowing for large margins on the\nmechanical parameters of the design.\nThe efficiency of the actuator is of the\norder of 10%, including the margins.\nThe average dissipated power while driving at full speed is of the order of 1 W,\nand can be scaled down linearly if the\nrate of cycling is reduced. This design\nproduces an extremely quiet actuator; it\ncan generate a force greater than 2 N\nand a stroke greater than 1 cm. The operational duration of SMA materials is of\nthe order of millions of cycles with some\nreduced stroke over a wide temperature\nrange up to 150 \xc2\xbaC.\nThis work was done by Mircea Badescu,\nStewart Sherrit, and Yoseph Bar-Cohen of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
