T i device can conduct\nhs\nthis measurement without actually physically contacting said sample, and while said sample is moving.\n\nsuch as the diameter of a cylinder which utilizes only a\nsingle beam of laser light. The diameter is determined\nby photoelectrically sensing when the laser beam is\nmodulated on or off by the edge of the object, using the\n5 first and second derivatives of the output of the sensor.\nAn auxiliary photoelectric output is obtained by passing\na part of the scanning laser beam onto a sensor over a\nprecision grading or scale with markings. This opera.tion generates a modulated signal whose spatial fre10 quency is independent of variations in the speed of\nscanning and intensity of the laser beam. Therefore, it\ncan be seen that the Zanoni patent calculates the diameter of the signal using a time duration of the signal\nrather than the signal's intensity.\n15\nTherefore, a review of the prior art has failed to\ndiscover any patent or other reference which determines the diameter of a moving cylindrical object utilizing only a single beam of laser light with the measurement being based upon the shadow diameter of the\n20 sample.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nAl laboratory light sources are, to some extent, nonl\nuniform across their beam front, both in time and in\nspace. Therefore, a light source imaged upon a screen\nexhibits both hot and cold spots which fade and\nbrighten, semi-uniformgradiationswhich fluctuate with\ntime, and a general waxing and waning of overall intens t . In an incandescent lamp, the variations are due to 25\niy\nasperities of the glass envelope, the shape and position\nof the filament, and time changes in the filament material such as oxidation or crystal growth. A laser suffers\nfrom defects in its optics, contaminants on its optical\nsurfaces, and lasing fluctuations. While the degree of 3\n0\nthese problems varies over orders of magnitude, they\nare always present to some extent and must be considered if one is attempting to use a light source at its\nhighest resolution.\nIf a light beam is used in such a way that a norm&- 35\ning (i.e., reference) signal is obtained from one part of\nthe beam front, and a mezxsurement signal is obtained\nfrom another part, then there will be inherent errors in\nthe normalized output due to the time and spatial variations alluded to above.\n40\nThere are three ways around this problem. The first\nsolution is to somehow homogenize the beam in time\nand space. The second solution is to obtain both the\nnormalizingsignal and the measurement signal from the\nsame portion of the beam,and to alternate samplings at 45\nintervals much shorter than the time variations of the\nlight source. The third solutionis of course to just determine that the errors are below the required system\naccuracy.\nSeveral U.S. patents exist in the field of utilizing radi- 50\nant energy to inspect the diameter of a moving cylindrical object. One of these patents is U.S. Pat. No.\n3,604,940 issued to David R. Matthews. As shown in\nFIG. 1, two highly collimated beams of light are directed tangentially along diametrically opposite surface 55\nportions of the object so as to be partially intercepted\nthereby. These partially intercepted beams are focused\non two detectors and then compared to determine the\nsize of the sample. Therefore, since two light beams are\nused, each signal would fluctuate differently with re- 60\nspect to time and space and errors in the readings would\nresult. In addition, even though a beam splitter is used in\nFIG. 6 to determine the diameter of very small objects,\ntwo different light beams are still employed and, similarly, errors would result.\n65\nU.S. Pat. No. 3,856,412 issued to Carl A. Zanoni\ndescribes an electro-optical sensor for providing an\noutput proportional to the cross-section of an object,\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention overcomes the defects of the\nprior art by placing a cylindrical member, such as a thin\nwire or filament, whose dimension is to be measured in\na beam of coherent, monochromatic light, the beam\nbeing obtained by oscillating a galvanometer mirror on\nwhich a laser beam is incident to produce a beam whose\ncross-section is oblong in a direction normal to the axis\nof the cylinder. Light that passes said cylindrical member is incident on a beam splitter having two channels.\nIn the first, or measurement channel, light passing the\ncylinder passes through a pair of knife edges and then\ninto a photodetector after passing through a light chopper. The knife edges in this channel are spaced apart a\ndistance slightly less than the beam height to block the\nouter periphery of the beam,allowing a pair of narrow\nbands of light to be incident on the detector. One edge\nof each band is establishedby a longitudinal edge of the\nmember, and the other edge of each band is established\nby a knife edge.\nLight passing through the second, or reference, channel of the beam splitter passes through two pairs of knife\nedges and into a second photodetector after passing\nthrough the light chopper. One set of knife edges is\nspaced apart a distancejust larger than the dimension of\nthe member, while the other set of knife edges is spaced\napart a distance substantially equal to the distance between the knife edges in the first channel. As a consequence, two narrow bands of light pass into the second\nphotodetector, such bands being slightly smaller than\nthe bands passed into the first photodetector.\nThe AC outputs of the photodetectors are respectively rectified to establish a pair of DC signals which\nare divided one into the other to establish a normalized\nsignal that is directly proportional to the size of the\nmember and independent of laser intensity, detector\ndark current, and slight lateral motion of the member.\nOther features and advantages of the invention will\nbe apparent from the following description, the accompanying drawing and the appended claims.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFIG. 1is a schematicdrawing of the laser extensometer according to the present invention; and\nFIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the lasing beam\ntaken through 2-2.\n\n4,06 1,427\n\n4\n\n3\n\nwidth of said beam being larger than the cross-secDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED\ntional width of the sample;\nEMBODIMENT\nbeam splitter means for dividing the radiant energy\nFIG. 1is a schematic drawing of the laser extensomepassing around the sample into a measurement and\na reference beam of radiant energy, the sample\nter according to the present invention.
