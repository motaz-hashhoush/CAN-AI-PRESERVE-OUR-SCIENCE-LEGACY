The Continuous Improvements\nProgram at CASI is the foundation for Total Quality\nManagement in products and services. The focus is\ncustomer-driven; its goal, to identify processes and\nprocedures that can be improved and new technologies that can be integrated with the processes to gain\nefficiencies, provide effectiveness,\nand promote\ncustomer satisfaction. This Program seeks to establish quality through an iterative defect prevention approach that is based on the incorporation of standards\nand measurements into the processing cycle. Four\nprojects are described that utilize cross-functional,\nproblem-solving teams for identifying requirements\nand defining tasks and task standards, management\nparticipation,\nattention to critical processes, and\nmeasurable long-term goals. The implementation of\nthese projects provides the customer with measurably\nimproved access to information that is provided\nthrough several channels: the NASA STI Database,\ndocument requests for microfiche and hardcopy, and\nthe Centralized Help Desk.\nIntroduction\nThe 1958 Space Act, which created the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA),\nprovided for "the widest practicable and appropriate\n\ndissemination of information concerning its activities\nand the results thereof." This dissemination is supported by NASA through its Scientific and Technical\nInformation (STI) Program.\nOne goal of the STI\nProgram is to develop a global program to encourage\nthe creation and exchange of scientific and technical\ninformation and to facilitate its use.\nIn support of the NASA and NASA ST[ Program\ngoals and objectives, the NASA STI Program\'s\nCenter for AeroSpace Information (CASI) acquires,\nperforms value-added processing for, and disseminates\ninformation of interest to scientists and engineers\ninvolved in aerospace research and development.\nThis information is available through the NASA STI\nDatabase and the hardcopy and microfiche distribution.\nCASI\'s mission is to support the STI Program in\nsupplying the NASA user community with timely\naccess to scientific and technical information in areas\nincluding aerospace and space science industries.\nEasy access to such information will extend knowledge and facilitate new and further research in these\nfields. It also will keep NASA and its users in the\nforefront of today\'s information revolution, where the\namount of available information is rapidly increasing\nand the tools to access that information are, often, still\nunder development.\nThis is a revolution that will yield global information systems and enable users to be in command of\nincreasingly powerful workstations that are tied to\nlarge, multi-user computational facilities. They will\nhave access to distributed and remote data collection\ndevices, advanced analytical and manipulation\n\ntools\n\nand and\ndata information\nrepositories promote\nthat\nthe\nrapidexchange dataandideas,\nof\nandnewinformation dissemination tools such as multimedia and CDROM.\nBecause of these vast changes in the type, volume, and availability of information required, as well\nas in the rapid technological advances that support\nthese new requirements, it is critical that the STI\nProgram meet this information revolution with a\nrevolution in quality.\nNot only will yesterday\'s\nquality products and services not meet today\'s requirements m today\'s quality products and services\nwill not meet tomorrow\'s requirements.\nWe must\nrespond with quality products and services to guide\nNASA and its users to and beyond today\'s steadily\nincreasing number of databases and variety of access\nchannels. We consider Total Quality Management\n(TQM) as embracing the principles that are necessary\nto support NASA in carrying out its mission to\nexpand man\'s knowledge, ensure U.S. leadership in\naerospace technology research and development, and\nto develop wor]d--class:_s._i\n: _\nThe STI Program\'s\n\n;LIC\nIMPROVE\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nJUSTIFY BUDG\nAND INNOVATIC\n\nDECREASE\nCOSTS\n\nIMPROVE\nQUALITY\nON INVESTMENT\n\nFigure\n\ni_-The\n\nDeming\n\nChain\n\nReaction\n\nTQM Imperative\n\nThe STI Program must improve today\'s products\nand services to support th_ current and future information requirements of the STI community. We must\nbuild the infrastructure to ensure that the next generation of improvements supports our requirements for\nscientific and technical information. Improved products and services and a new infrastructure will\nprovide the quality performance necessary for the\ninformation and quality revolutions: a proactive,\nanticipatory approach; new product innovation; quick\ndecision making; teamwork; and cooperation.\nThis improvement of products and services cannot be\nstagnant. Indeed, use of TQM methodology and tools\nbecomes pervasive m with each process, systems are\nexecuted better and better. Productivity increases as\ninefficiency and errors decrease.\nCustomers get\nhigher value products and services at lower cost. The\norganization\'s reputation for quality and value expands and demand for its product or service will\nincrease. This cycle, as put forth by Dr. W. Edward\nDenting, is summarized in Figure 1.\nThe STI Program\'s emphasis on customer requirements, both internal and external, guides our\nimperative for TQM. It drives our goal to refine\n\nprocesses that will build in the quality necessary to\nensure uniform and superior products and services.\nThe Evolution of the STI Program\'s\nContinuous Improvements Program\nThe STI Program\'s TQM initiative at CASI, the\nContinuous Improvements\nProgram, provides the\nfoundation for Total Quality Management of its\nproducts and services. The focus of the program is\ncustomer-driven;\nits goal, to proactively identify\nprocesses and procedures that can be improved and\nnew technologies that can be integrated with the\nprocesses to gain efficiencies, to provide effectiveness, and promote customer satisfaction.\nThe STI Program\'s evolving Continuous Improvements Program at CASI is following the four phase\nprocess that is common within organizations who\nadopt TQM:\nPhase I, Estabfishing the Foundation: Early\nadvocatesnd senior management commitmenL\na\n\nPhase H, Developing Widespread Awareness:\nOrganizational awareness, understanding, and pilot\nprojects.\nPhase HI, Transforming the Organization:\nwide-scale deployment; significant results.\n\nFull,\n\nPhase IV, Mature, Continuous Process: Stable\nprocesses, continuously improving.\nAs an organization moves through these phases,\nits planning and control focus changes from management of the end result to management of the process.\nA domino effect results: first productivity, then lower\nunit cost and prices, then increased improved service\ninnovations, increased user satisfaction -- and,\nultimately, an expanded user community.\nPhase I of the ST/ Program\'s Continuous Improvements Program at CASI had its early advocates\nin senior management who hired staff dedicated to\nproviding operational improvements. In Phase II this\nstaff began the task of supporting the review of the\nSTI Program\'s mission and evaluating its systems and\nprocesses.\nThe STI Program\'s mission of collecting, enhancing the value of, and storing information, and disseminating that information to authorized users has\nnot changed since its inception. Its systems at CASI,\nboth automated and manual, are old. Many of the\nprocesses have not changed or have changed slowly\nonly to incorporate policy changes or limited automation. On the other hand, the volume of information\nand the demand for faster service has increased.\n\ncan be the input to the next process or an external\nuser of STI products and services.\nWe began by selecting several projects that had a\nhigh probability of success and that would bring about\nvisible improvements. These early projects gave us\ninsights into the barriers that we had to overcome.\nThe facilitator created teams from multiple functional\nareas to provide problem solving and to design new\nprocesses.\nThe teams, whose members had little\nexperience in team dynamics or problem solving,\nexhibited all the signs of resistance: complacency,\nlack of communication,\nlack of knowledge and\nunderstanding, conflicting goals, and resistance to\nchange. They exhibited fear, anxiety, and insecurity.\nThe facilitator worked to establish communication\namong the team members, understanding that trust\nmust be built to enable *buy-in" to TQM processes.\nEach team changed with time, with its members\nreaching a stage of cooperation, communication,\nenthusiasm, excitement, and buy-in that they later\ncommunicated to other staff. Not all teams responded\nas quickly as others, but all made progress and all\nprojects had measurable success.\nAs a result of the pilot projects described in the\nfollowing sections, the Program is now moving to\nPhase HI, Transformation\nto the TQM Culture.\nFigure 2 shows how the elements of key management\nleadership, communications, long-term commitment,\na hospitable environment, and employee partnership\nfor quality R all proven in the STI Program\'s Phase\nI and 11 implementations m are key to the success of\nany organizational culture change. The presence of\n\nThe first barrier CASI encountered in implementing Phase 1I was culture, which does not change\novernight.\nSome of the staff at CASI have been\nproviding services to the NASA community for as\nlong as the program has been in existence and many\nhave received awards for 5, 10, and 20 years of\nservice. As it would be in any organization poised\nfor change, these staff are resistant to change.\nChange is outside their comfort zone, and many of\nthem are very comfortable "just the way things are."\nOur first hurdle was to overcome the complacency\nthat is common to so many organizations.\nOur\nsecond hurdle was creating the paradigm shift required for redefining "customer," which in TQM is\ndefined as the receiver of a product or service. This\n\nFigure 2. Critical Success Factors for\nCultural Change\n\nthese critical elements in the STI Program\'s evolving\nTQM focus predicts the accomplishment\nof the\ncultural change that is required for the success of the\nContinuous Improvements Program.\n\nSTOP\n\xe2\x80\xa2 I_istanm\n_ll_e-_l\n\nTQM in Action: the First 4 Pilot Proiects\nThe STI Program used four pilot projects in its\nimplementation of the Continuous Improvements\nProgram: Revised Input Processing, 3-Day Turnaround of Document Requests, Microfiche Quality\nImprovements, and Centralized Help Desk. These\nprojects served as the fast tests for the STI Program\'s\nuse of TQM methods such as utilizing cross-functional, problem-solving teams for identifying requirements\nand for defining tasks and task standards, participation\nfrom all levels of management, attention to critical\nprocesses, and incorporation of measurable long-term\ngoals. They served, as well, as a tool for the development of the STI Program\'s TQM methodology,\nwhich today includes nine steps:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n\nCreate cross-functional, problem-solving teams.\nAnalyze processes.\nIdentify root problem.\nDevelop new processes.\nReach consensus.\nDevelop measurable goals.\nDevise and execute an implementation schedule.\nReview successes and lessons learned.\nDocument the results.\n\nImplementation of these projects has provided\nNASA customers measurable improvement in access\nto information that is available through several\nchannels: the NASA STI Database, document requests\nfor microfiche and hardcopy, and the Centralized\nHelp Desk. As discussed in the following sections,\nthe STI Program encountered barriers common to the\nimplementation of TQM (see Figure 3). We found\nthe use of the tools that help overcome these barriers\nto be an evolutionary process, one that is key to our\nsuccessful transition to a TQM culture. Our goal is\nto provide an environment that encourages trust,\nteamwork, and mission focus through cultural change.\nTraining will be an important component of our\nprogram.\nRevised Input Processing ]Proje_\nThe Revised Input Processing Project was initiated\nto reduce the time required to process technical\n\nto Change\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lackof Know_Im\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lackof Understmm\'Ing\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cornplamncy\n\n,q -g\n\nao\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Trust\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mlssiofl\nF-ocus\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cultural\nChange\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Teemwork\n\nFigure 3. Overcoming\n\nthe Barriers to TQM\n\nreports for inclusion in the NASA STI Database and\nto distribute technical reports in the form of microfiche. This project crossed five functional areas:\nInput Processing, Publications, ADP Technologies,\nOperations, and Media Conversion.\nCurrent Processing. Input Processing provides\nbibliographic processing for the scientific and technical reports that are received at CASI from NASA,\nNASA contractors, other government agencies, and\nforeign partners such as the European Space Agency.\nThis bibliographic information is added to the NASA\nSTI Database and accessed through RECON (R.Esearch CONnection, NASA\'s search and retrieval\nsystem) and certain government and commercial\ndatabases. The reports are made available to NASA\nand NASA conwactors, the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), and the Government Printing\nOffice (GPO) on microfiche distribution.\nMedia Conversion creates silver master microfiche\nof the hardcopy reports and duplicates the silver\nmasters and the microfiche received from other\nagencies for distribution.\nPublications staff create camera-ready copy of the\nunclassified bibliographic information so that its\ndistribution to subscribers in a twice monthly bibliography of all unclassified technical reports added to the\nSTI Database, Scientific and Technical AeroSpace\nReports (STAR), is made possible.\nADP Technologies maintains the programs for\n\nprocessing the bibliographic information, loading the\ncitations to the database, and producing the cameraready copy. Operations runs the programs to load the\ncitations to the database and produce the publication\nruns when an issue of STAR is completed.\nThe Root Problem.\nCustomer complaints fell\ninto two related categories: (1) too much time elapsed\nfrom the time they sent reports to CASI and the\nreports appeared on the Database and (2) they did not\nreceive the microfiche copies until weeks after the\nreports appeared on the Database.\nThe root of the problem lay in the processes for\naccomplishing all these tasks. These processes had\nbeen instituted years before and were tied to the\npublication of STAR,\nOther bibliographic, media\nconversion, and publication activities took place, but\nthese supplementary activities were coordinated and\nproduced during slow periods in the processing of\nSTAR.\nDistribution of the microfiche, which were produced and duplicated after all reports for a given\npublication were processed, occurred after the publication of STAR, which occurred six weeks after the\ncitations were loaded to the NASA STI Database.\nThe New Processes. Our solution for overcoming the problem was two-fold: in Input Processing, all\nreports that were received from Document Supply and\ncompleted on a given day (with certain exceptions\nsuch as conference proceedings, which are made up\nof many technical reports) would be forwarded to\nMedia Conversion for processing the following day.\nThis eliminated the 2 to 2-1f2 week delay formerly\nincurred by holding completed reports for the next\nissue of STAR.\nThe Measurable Goals.\nOur goal with this\nproject was to reduce the time required to process\ntechnical reports for inclusion in the NASA STI\nDatabase and to distribute technical reports in the\nform of microfiche within a week of the appearance\nof the citations on that Database. This was our fast\nattempt at improving processes for measurable gain.\nWe calculated that approximately 500 citations could\nbe added to the NASA STI Database on a weekly\nbasis and that the microfiche could be distributed\napproximately 4 weeks earlier than with the current\nprocess.\n\nBarriers to a Fully Functioning Team.\nThe\nRevised Input Processing Team included representatives from all five functional areas and a facilitator.\nAlthough the group was quite willing to participate in\ninterviews and reviews to document the current\nprocess, they were not so willing to entertain the\npossibility of changing the processes. Because these\nprocesses had been in effect for many years, changes\nto the processes had been instituted as exception\nprocessing and the groups were tied to the way\n"things had always been done." Communication was\ndifficult because "selective memory" played a large\nrole in determining the current processes. Getting to\na cooperative spirit was difficult because staff had\n"101 reasons" why processes could not be changed.\nThere was a feeling of inertia and complacency in\nthe group, and during the analysis and design of the\nnew process, the facilitator had to push team members\nto action because of tight time constraints. The team\nlacked understanding and experience in team problem\nsolving, and found it easier to do things as they had\nalways been done. They were afraid that new processes would not work and that they would miss\ndeadlines. They tried very hard to hold on to the old\nways, and they were reluctant to consider that new\nideas really can work.\nReaching Consensus.\nThe team members were\nnot skilled in team interaction or team problem\nsolving. They demonstrated barriers to teamwork -resistance to change, communication difficulties, time\nconslraints, conflicting goals, lack of understanding,\nand complacency among the team -- and reaching\nconsensus was very difficult. Once it was decided\nhow the project would be limited (only changes that\naffected our goal would be implemented) and how it\nwould be implemented, however, the team began\nworking very actively together to develop schedules\nfor the new process. Their first steps were to perform\nan analysis of the current processes and to begin\ndesigning and implementing the new processes.\nDespite working so closely together, team members\nhad doubts about whether or not their implementation\nplan would work. To reduce this anxiety, Input\nProcessing began a month before implementation to\npractice processing all series of documents (not only\nSTAR) on a daily basis in the number required to\nmeet the goals that had been established.\nMedia\nConversion worked to process all reports that were in\nprocess so that they would he prepared for the new\nprocess. Publications and Operations worked to fit\n\ninitiated to bring microfiche clarity and resolution up\nto industry standards for microfiche reading, duplicating, and archiving. This project is unique among the\nfour projects in that the functional areas critical to the\nchange process included outside federal agencies over\nwhich the STI Program had no control.\n\ntheir staffing and workload schedules to the new\nprocess.\nADP Technologies worked with each\nfunctional area to identify their programming require,\nments and ensure that these were met. With these\nsuccesses, enthusiasm crept into the team and they\nbecame committed to the project. To ensure continued success, the team met on a daily basis to ensure\nthe schedules were synchronized and that no task was\nforgotten.\n\nCurrent Processing.\nMicrofiche silver master\ncopies are produced by the Media Conversion staff\nfrom the NASA hardcopy technical reports. These\nsilver masters, along with diazo master microfiche\nfrom other agencies are duplicated and distributed to\nrequesters. Primary distribution is automatically sent\nto subscription customers and secondary distribution\nis sent upon customer request.\n\nEnthusiasm increased, consensus was the rule, and\nthe day production went into effect the implementation was flawless.\nOvercoming Barriers to Success and Lessons\nLe_ed.\nWe found that communication was the\ngreatest factor in overcoming problems; later, the\ncomment most expressed regarded the rewards that\ncommunication brought. Because the cross functional\nteam was committed to the tasks and had reached\nconsensus, information was exchanged in a positive\nenvironment and feedback was provided to all team\nmembers. The members of the team began trusting\nthe process and the team members.\nEarly in the\nprocess new technology was put forth as the panacea\nfor correcting all problems. But as the new processes\nfell into place, excitement grew regarding the improvements that change in process would bring. New\ntechnology was still seen as a tool for increasing\nproductivity but not the only one. All goals of the\nproject were met and exceeded. The team felt ownership for the project, and its success was celebrated\nwith a pizza party - not a big reward but a beginning.\n\nThe Root Problem.\nProducing good quality\nduplicate microfiche that meet standards requires the\nuse of a good quality master. In addition, the microfiche must be free from dust and foreign materials or\nfingerprints.\nA large percentage of the distribution microfiche\ndid not meet standards. Further analysis led to the\ndiscovery of multiple reasons for lack of quality:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Duplicate microfiche produced from CASl-produced silver master microfiche were well within\nstandards.\nThe problem was with the microfiche\nreceived from other agencies, which became our input\nfor making duplicates. We could not make the output\nbetter than the input.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Some of the microfiche contained fingerprint\nsmudges, specs of dirt, or other foreign material.\n\nResults.\nImplementation of the Revised Input\nProcessing Project yielded results that met the established goals.\nThe scheduled time to load the\naccessions to the STI Database was reduced from 2\nweeks to 1 week. In addition, the system now provides the capability to load accessions in less time if\ndesired, even daily.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There were problems with grid misalignment and\nresolution.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The micrographics\ncient.\n\nis old and ineffi-\n\nThe New Processes. Our solution for overcoming the problem had a dual focus: outside suppliers\nand internal quality problems. The team identified\nand implemented several internal processes to improve microfiche quality:.\n\nMicrofiche processing time was reduced from 6 to\n8 weeks to 2-1/2 weeks. It is now available within\none week of the availability of the technical _ports in\nthe NASA STI Database.

One goal established for the\nMicrofiche Quality Improvement\nProject was to\ndevise and implement new internal processes for\naddressing microfiche quality, based on the ANSI/AIIM standard. Since suppliers provide the diazo\nmicrofiche as part of an agreement with NASA,\nanother goal was to convince the suppliers to provide\nbetter microfiche.\nBawlers to a Fully Functioning Team. Getting\nto a cooperative spirit with outside suppliers has been\n\na real challenge and we have not reached full resolution. Since there is no cost associated with the\nmicrofiche, asking the agencies to supply better\nmicrofiche does not guarantee success. Our approach\nis to request that these outside suppliers improve the\nquality of the microfiche they submit, by reminding\nthem of the federal requirements but not demanding\ntheir cooperation.\nInternal staff projected resistance to change.\nTheir comments included "we\'ve never worn gloves\nbefore to prevent smudges," "they don\'t affect quality," and "we can still read the microfiche with t\'mgerprints." Communication was lx_or and negotiating\nwith staff to follow procedures was difficult. They\nwould not buy-in to the change process.\nReachinz Consensus. Implementing change to\nprocesses that had been in place for a long time\nrequired convincing staff that quality could not be\nguaranteed unless processes were in place to guarantee that quality. Therefore, establishing the criteria to\n\nbe used determining\nfor\nthequality inputor the\nof\nresulting icroficherovided good\nm\np\na\nlesson conin\nsensusecision aking theteam.Theyfinally\nd\nm\nfor\nadopted\nDeming\'s\nprinciples:unless\nvariation\nis\ncontrolled,\nprocesses\narenotin control ndlackof\na\nquality theresult. Fingerprints or foreign material\nis\non the microfiche do make a difference, even though\nyou can read the copy. If your input is not__ eeting\nm\nstandards, you cannot control the variability of your\noutput. Their development of quality criteria finally\nenabled them to see that many of our customers use\nthe microfiche they receive from CASI to make\ncopies. Each rime a microfiche is duplicated, it is not\nas good as the previous generation. Therefore, if the\nmicrofiche we distribute can be read but does not\nmeet industry standards, customer satisfaction levels\ndrop because the microfiche they create from our\nmicrofiche may not be readable.\nOvercoming Barriers to Success and Lessons\nLearned. Overcoming the external problems in this\narea was very difficult because we have little control\nover outside suppliers.\nAdditionally, many of the\nteam members had been in their positions for a long\ntime and were deeply entrenched in the current\nprocesses, To meet the project\'s goals, the team had\nto overcome their defense of the current definitions of\n\nMedia Conversion. The team consisted of members\nfrom these five areas and a facilitator.\nCurrent Processes. User Services is responsible\nfor receiving all requests for products. Requests for\nhardcopy or stock copies are sent to the Document\nSupply for fulfillment of the order with stock hardCopy. Requests for microfiche are sent to the Media\nConversion for microfiche copies or hardcopy blown\nback from microfiche.\nThe Root Problem. The root problem lay in the\nmanual processes, which were made more complex by\nlack of automation. These manual processes yielded\nan average turnaround time of more than 5 days for\ndocument request full\'aliment. Also, the team believed\nthat the turnaround time for orders could not be\nimproved because many of the factors influencing the\nturnaround time were not within their control. For\nexample, if a technical report is not available from\nstock, microfiche, or blowback, it is ordered from\nNTIS or from the source; STI Program staff do not\nhave control over the turnaround time from outside\nsources. Because they felt it impossible to fill 100\npercent of the document orders in 3 days, they\ndecided that the project could not be done.\n\nquality and the current workflow processes. To reach\na consensus that readability does not ensure standards\nare met, the team had to achieve a new def\'mition of\nmicrofiche quality and a new understanding that the\nlevel of effort necessary to achieve the project\'s goals\nwas more than simply upgrading CASI\'s old micro.\nfiche duplicating equipment.\n\nThe New Processes.The existing processes were\nsimplified and, where possible, automated.\nThe\nautomated processes perform much of the decision\nmaking formerly done by User Services: the order\nforms are sorted by section and are date- and timestamped, and reports are generated by section, by age,\nand by status.\n\nResults. New procedures incorporating updated\nspecifications have been put into place, and workflow\nprocesses changed.\nMicrofiche that do not meet\nminimum standards are rejected. We are working\nwith the agencies to get better microfiche, and upgrading CASI\'s old microfiche duplicating equipment\nto improve quality and processing speed, as well as to\nprovide incentive and motivation to the staff.\n\nGeneration of the order forms was changed from\nnightly to predetermined intervals throughout the day.\n(Since the current system implementation only generated the order forms nightly during a batch run, the\norders were already 1 day old when received for\nfulfillment.)\n\n3-Day Turnaround of Documents Project\nThe 3-Day Turnaround Project was initiated to\nreduce the amount of time between receipt of a\nrequest for a document and receipt of the requested\ndocument by the customer. It required a team that\ncrossed five functional areas: User Services, Document Supply, ADP Technologies, Operations, and\n\nMeasurable\n\nGoals.\n\nThe team determined a\n\nphased implementation for this project, with the goal\nfor Phase I set to achieve 3-day turnaround for 80\npercent of the document requests.

Cooperation across these functional areas on the subject of\n\ndocument requests was not always _endly\nbecause\nsomeone\nhad to be "blamed" if the 5-day deadline\nwas not met. In addition, some team members had\nheld their positions for a long time" they would forget\nto include critical steps in the process, so it took a\nnumber of iterations\nto complete\nthe analysis of\ncurrent processes.\nMany of these processes were\nmanual and some team members doubted that automation could make the logical decisions that they had to\nmake.\nSome doubted that the processes\nin place\ncould be improved; additionally,\nsome doubted that\nsome of the responsibilities\ncurrently\nhold by one\nfunctional area could be completed\nby another area\n\ndocument\n\nrequests completed\n\nwithin tluee days.\n\nI\n\ni!\n\nwithout their oversight.\nReaching\nConsensus.\nTwo of the functional\nareas had participated in the previous projecL With\ntheir newly acquired skills and a bettor team attitude,\nthey contributed\nstrongly to the negotiation required\nwhen the team could not reach a consensus that 3-day\n\n#mmn\n\nFigure\n\nOvercoming\nBarriers to Success and Lessons\nLearned:\nThe need for good communication\nwas\n\nCentralized\n\nthat the computer could incorporate\nthe logic of\nmanual processes, such as request coordination, until\nthey saw it work, and today the computer program\nsorts the order forms by responsible section.\nBecause\n\nthe\n\nidea\n\nthat\n\nif the\n\norder is wrong\n\nthat\n\n_\n\ntaw\n\nt_mt\n\nturnaround of 100 percent of document requests could\nbe achieved.\nThe team negotiated, instead, what they\ndetermined\nto be an achievable\ngoal:\na phased\nimplementation.\nThis successful negotiation was an\nindicator that trust and team skills wore increasing.\n\nparamount in this project, since the document w,quests\nare coordinated among the functional areas responsible for delivery.\nTeam members were not convinced\n\nttw\n\n4.

Since the automation of processes and acquisi\xe2\x80\xa2tion of equipment was taking time, the team negotiated an approach to begin implementation before the\nautomated system was in place. They established a\nphysical place for the Help Desk and assigned team\nmembers to be available to answer the phone at all\ntimes.\n\nsystem. Since calls could not be tracked, customers\ndid not always receive a personalized response; the\ncall volume and the quality and timeliness of customer response could not be managed. This impacted\ncustomer satisfaction as well as management oversight\nof workload levels.\nNew Processes. Our solution for overcoming the\nproblem is multi-faceted:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide a single telephone number that roils to\nmultiple lines.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProvide friendIy, trained, human contact.\nOvercoming Barriers to Success and Lessons\nbeamed.\nTo overcome the barriers, STI Program\nmanagement and staff provided motivational opportunities to improve morale, skill levels, and attitude.\nWe held a contest to name the function and created\nslogans, and provided customer service training and\ntraining in the functions staff would be performing so\nthat they would become more knowledgeable. With\nimplementation we will continue to work with the\nproblems of their accepting the responsibility for\nbeing available and projecting a customer service\nattitude.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide prompt response to all problems and\nrequests by training staff in user service techniques\nand educating them in STI Program functions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Improve the quality of STI products and services\nthrough analysis of customer feedback collected\nduring telephone conversations.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Utilize an automated call tracking system for data\ncollection and report generation.\nMeasurable Goals: The goals of the Centralized\nHelp Desk Project are to provide fast, personal\nservice and acctwate information to the STI Program\ncustomers, and to create a call [Jacking system that\nprovides management reports. User satisfaction will\nbe measured by customer surveys, the Monthly Center\nEvaluation Report, and feedback from the callers.\nStatistics being gathered during the Phase I implementation will provide the basis for measurable goals.\n\nResults. The Centralized Help Desk has not been\nfully implemented, due to delayed receipt of equipment, but comments from the Center Evaluation\nReport indicate that improvements have been demonstrated in the Phase I implementation. Meanwhile, it\nis already providing the added benefit of allowing the\ncollection of statistics which will guide us in the full\nimplementation.\nSummary.\n\nBarriers to a Fully Functioning Team: The\nbarriers to this project were those common to any\ntransition of existing staff to professional customer\nservices staff: a belief that it is impossible to please\ncustomers; a lack of understanding that customer\nsatisfaction does not mean saying yes to every request, but rather managing the customer\'s expectations so that they are satisfied even when the answer\nis no; a feeling that their services were not appreciated by customers; and a lack of recognition that "going\n"that extra mile" for the customer is each and everyone\'s job. This lack of understanding and complacency increased the time required to reach consensus.\n\nAll projects have produced measurable results.\nAll team members learned the value of good communication and the necessity of developing that\ncommunication not only within groups and across\nfunctional areas but also with the end users and with\noutside suppliers.\nThis has resulted in improved\nservice quality.\nLessons Learned\nAlong the path to the implementation\nCASI learned many lessons:\n\nReaching Consensus: Reaching consensus was\ndifficult because the team lacked understanding and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n10\n\nof change\n\nWe could achieve results while learning to func-\n\ndonin a team\n\nenvironment.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The talent and skills of team members must be\nuncovered.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For many reasons -- fear, insecurity, inertia,\ndistrust -- team members do not immediately buy in\nto the concept of change. Trust must be developed\nwithin the group and consensus reached before real\nprogress can be made.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It takes time to develop goals with a customer\nfocus. Often team members feel that they are the\nexperts and, therefore, know what the customer needs\nand should want. The new perspective will occur\nonly when team members realize that the system they\nbuild may be the best in the world, but if it lacks the\nquality and features desired by the customer, they will\nnot be meeting customer requirements.\nCommunication\n\nis essential\n\nto progress\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the following STI\nProgram staff for supporting the development and\nproduction of this paper in the areas of substantive\nediting, graphics, word processing, and desktop\npublishing: Debbie Stubberfield, Debbie Drumheller,\nTrina Forte, Mark Jeschke, Saundra Wheeler, Bruce\nAnsley, Jackie Streeks, and Ralph Daniel.\n\nand\n\nSUCCESS.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To eliminate the fear and distrust, team members\nmust understand the mission, goals, and objectives of\nthe STI Program.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Definition of success indicators is essential for the\ndevelopment of the goals and objectives and success\nof the project.
