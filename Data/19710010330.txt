In outside technic-.1 meetings, papers are\ngiven (supposedly) on projects w1hich have pro p-ressed to the\n-coint wherein si-nificant results can be reported. Our puri)o.^c\niU to r,-et reports on plans and pro gress, as well cis results,\non-going projects. These oral reports provide the opportunity for each man to become -- if not familiar -- \'it least\n\nfr(DM\n\naware of what work is carried on Oy NASA and wl-,o is doing it.\nSuch coordination is very necessary in an organi,:ation as\n\ncor:i plex and widespread as ours.\nI refer not only to administrative coordination, but\n\ntechnical as well. By describing his work before his fellow\nresearchers at a meeting; such as this, the researcher has the\nbenefit of constructive criticis:ii which ma y give him a lel.o.\n-e\non solving r: problem, or might even cause hirr, to talc a. different\ntack altogether. He hopefully would get the same benefits oy\n\ni\n\n14\nlistening to the other presentations and comments. We think\nthat this kind of exposure is particularly good for the Junior\nresearcher who may not ordinarily het to deliver a paper, or\neven attend, a technical society meting.\nI feel that I must apologize for, or at least explain,\nthe formidably lengthy agenda. Actually, it is partially the\nresult of tradition. Our first plasma physics meeting of this\ntype was held approximatellr 10 years ago while rie were still\n\nthe NACA. The number of in-house projects was ranch smaller\nthan we have today, of course, and the number of outside projects was almost nil. The subsequent expansion of research,\nboth in-house and by grant and contract, was great and consequently we end up with the program that we have today. 1\nmight add that in our other fluid physics areas we limit the\nprogram to the cut-of-house activities, with attendance and\ndiscussion by in-house personnel. Although this latter format\nresults in a less crowded agenda, there are obvious advantages\nin presenting, the entire program.\nNote that the agenda is broken down into groups of p resentations by each in-house unit, by contractor units, etc.,\nrather than be subject matter. We arranged it that way\nprimarily in order to "fix an image," so to sped:, of the work\ndone by different groups and in order to help identify in the\ninind of the audience as to where a particular piece of work\nis being done. It also enables one man to report on the work\nof several people when time limitations or travel restrictions\nprevent a researcher from presenting his own material.\nIn addition to reports on individual projects, the program\ncontains three roundtable discussions on topics of current\ninterest to the plasma field. We feel that such discussions\nare both stimulating and also serve to help chart future\nresearch.\nThe proceedings of this conference are summarized in the\nform of research abstracts which you have submitted. We feel\nthat these abstracts will form a valuable record of the conference, in that they present the objectives, background, and\nstatus of each piece of work, as well as, in many cases, significant researco results. They are bound in four separate\nvolur-s, in addition to an agenda "volume," simply for ease of\nhandling.\nA final word about the schedule. The talks and the meeting\nitself will be informal, and needless to say we welcome comments\n\nI\n\n15\nand provocative questions -- the more the better. In view of\nthe very tight schedule, however, Sucli discussions must be\nbrief and to the point. I ask the cooperation of the speakers\nand session chairman to adhere strictly to the allotted time\nso that each speaker will have his opportunity to be heard.\nI\'ll now turn this meeting over to Dr. Thom, who is the\ngeneral chairman for this meeting and who has worked hard on\ngetting the meeting organized.\n\nY\n\n16\nPLLSEA RESEARCH\nStepping Stone To Future Space Technolo;y\nby\nKarlheinz Thom\nFluid Physics Branch\nA couple of montl.s ago, at the Fourth Goddard Memorial\nSymposium, a number of illustrious speakers from universitiez,\nindustry, and government drew pictures of the Space Age in\nthe Fiscal Year 2001. Such projections were, of course,\nhighly speculative, and the conservative participant may have\nlooked at them with lots of reservation. ^:lso, one was inclined\nto judge tizat the Fiscal Year 1986 might have been a better\ntarget for such scientific nd technological forecasts. Twenty\nyears are a reasonable time for correlating such forecast with\nthe lead times for developing advanced technological systems.\nThus, predicting the technological needs in FY 1986 would have\nhad implications to setting goals for present research and\ndevelopment program planning. The detachment from such possible\nimplications, however, enabled the speakers to treat more\nliberally the subject of scientific and technological forecasting.\nThe technical man is traditionally restrained regarding\nprognoses in his field, so that in retrospect the achievements\nof the recent decades exceed by far the expert spectulations\nin the past. If an extrapolation into the future by analogy\nwith the past is assumed to be valid, one should consider even\noptimistic, contemporary predictions, as conservative. The\nconsensus of the Symposium was then, after discussing pros and\ncons, that in the picture, about the turn of the millenium,\nwe will be in the position to do, technologically, almost\neverything, -- apart from doing ridiculous things, such, for\ninstance, as exceeding the velocity of light, or operating the\nperpetium mobile. Controversy remained only regarding the\nquestion: what should we do? Or, which of all the technological\noptions, emerging from our rapidly growing sciences, will we\npick up and promote?\nEven if the US GNP, as predicted, keeps growing at rates\ncomparable with those in the past, so that in the year 2000\nour national income will exceed 3000 billion dollars, and even\nif the Federal Government budget will remain at 20% of the\nGNP, as it appears to be necessary to many experts for the\nstabilization of the economy as a whole, will space spending\nremain at roughly 5% of the government expenditures? In one\nof the more conservative presentations at the Symposium, it\nwas pointed out that too many things remain to be done right\nhere on the earth as opposed to forecasting too brilliant a\nfuture of the space program. It was said that technological\nprogress was generally greatly overestimated. For instance,\n\n17\n\nregarding vital items such as the water closet and the automobile, there was no progress during the past three decades\nwhatsoever!\nOn the more serious side it was mentioned that problems\nsuch as air pollution, water pollution, desalinization of\nseawater, sociological problems following automation, etc.\nwould rapidly attain priority over the space program, which,\nafter losing momentum in the cold war, would eventually\nstagnate at a relatively low level. The majority of the speakers\nhowever, came to a much more optimistic conclusion. Their\narguments regarding the likelihood of an appreciable growth of\nspace technology had, as it appeared to me, a particular bearing\nto our plasma research, and I think it should therefore be worthwhile to convey sane of such thoughts to you. The links to our\nspecific plasma research are, of course, my own contemplations.\nFollowing the illustrious space philosophers, I will first\npoint out that space might be a pioneer-land with a variety of\ncommercial opportunities. (I do not know anything about\nmilitary utilization of space, neither had this item been discussed at the symposium). Next I will indicate that the economics\nof commercial use of space heavily depend on advanced space\nsystems, particularly in regard to high energy density propulsion.\nThe development of such "compact" space systems will ultimately\nenable the smaller nations to participate in the commercial\nexploitation of space. A worldwide international competition\nwill then be established. I will speculate then that plasma\nphysics research represents a crucial stepping stone toward\nthe development of compact high energy density space systems.\nThe question, whether space technology will be among the prior\ntechnological options we will pick in the future, will then be\nanswered through the expectation of space commerce, and the\nneed for technological leadership in international competition.\nRegarding our virtually unlimited technological capabilities\nfor succeeding so, it will be seen that plasma physics must be\nexpected to contribute an integral part to it.\nFollowing E. P. Wheaton (reference 2), one may define\ncommerce as the selling of goods or services, hopefully for a\nprofit. We introduce the term "entrepreneur," and define it\nthat one who plans and carries out commerce. According to\nWheaton, good entrepreneuring involves not only financial and\npolitical know how, but also a flair for technology. The work\nflair is used in the sense of a good instinct for guessing with\nreasonable accuracy what will come "in spite of informed\ntechnical opinions to the contrary" , sensing its salabi ity,\nand moving in before those of fainter heart perceive the opport; .n.\xe2\x80\x94,\'\n\n18\n\nThe tern cntrcp^ enetlr is traditicnall;; ^ orincctcd c;ith\nprivate enterprice.

The question is then, is there\nsomething in space that can be sold, and can we expect that a\nmarket for space products will exist, so that, apart from such\nspace products, also a demand for space systems will emerge?\nThe commercial usefulness of satellites for communication\nis already being demonstrated today. In figures 1 and 2 is\nshown the possible usefulness of space for global sightseeing\nand snob appeal for tourists. Based on the assumption that\nadvanced space technology will develop, such as reusable nuclear\npowered space ships, first the cost for a stay in an orbiting\nspace resort hotel are computed. Both tables originate from\ndifferent authors (references 1 and 2), and the specific\ntechnological means assumed for such computations differ too.\nBut both come to a surprisingly close result. The cost for\na one or two day stay in the orbit resort hotel, including\ntransportation up and return, should not :ost more than a\ntoday\'s first class round trip.ticket to L,-rope. Considering\nthat presumably the earning capacity of average people will\ndouble by the time when such trips become available the ,journey\ninto orbit appears to be cheap enough that, indeed, millions\ncould afford it. Whether they will go, we do not know. The\nRussians, as has been told, are selling already reservations for\nsimilar trips, and if such information is correct, several\nthousand individuals have already registered. The more extended\nspace trips, as shown in figure 2, are figured on the basis that\na nuclear gaseous core rocket has been developed and that the\nheavy development cost and initial operational outlays for the\nvehicle would be written off by government financing. Account\nhas ben taken of the vehicle volume limitati ns, allowing\no\n100 ft per passenger to Earth orbit, 400 ft per passenger to\nthe Moon, and 1000 ft3 per passenger to the near planets.\nAnother area of commercial use of space could be the\nproduction of materials. In figure 3 (reference 2) is shown\na survey of current Earth markets for metals and minerals that\nare expensive. Nine of the materials cost more than $100 per\npound and have yearly markets over $10.mi111on. The yearly\nmarkets for uranium and gold are each over $1 billion. Included\nare some items that might profitably be processed in space,\neven if not found there. Silicon monocrystals, widely used in\nelectronic manufacture, cost $595 per pound; several of the highpriced metals in extremely pure form are similarly expensive.\n\n1^\nJ\n\nHence, carryin g; impure metals to orbit for vacuum refinement\ncould easily be profitable. The crucial criterion appears to\nbe the transportation cost.\nIn fi-ure 4 (reference 3) the cost in dollars per pound\nuseful payload are plotted against velocity increment needed\nfor various space missions. Again reusable space ships are\nassumed. It is seen that chemical systems at a specific\nimpulse of 425 ,sec. always will be extremely expensive for\ntrips beyond the Earth orbit because of payload limitation.\nNuclear propulsion at 1000 sec. Isp is expected to become\nquite economical up to lunar missions. For voyages to the\nplanets and astroids only nuclear gas core rockets and nuclear\nelectric rockets will ; yield economical cargo cost.\nIn the light of such an analysis of potential cargo cost\nin space transportation, the previous survey of markets of\nexpensive materials becomes more meaningful. rL:pparently,\nmultibillion dollar industries and trades could be revolutionized by economical space transport through advanced high energy\ndensity systems! For instance, if iron meteorites do represent\nmaterial from the core of a planet that supposedly broke up\nsome time ago into the astroid belt, an iron asteroid one mile\nin diameter containing 9% nickel (typical of meteorite percentages; would supply the current world product rate for over\n4,000 ye^.rs! suite interesting are also speculations regarding\nthe production of rocket fuel on the moon. Because of the\nlow grav:Ltation on the lunar surface, moon made fuels are\nessentially highly energetic in comparison to Earth produced\nfuel. Thi3 fact may greatly compensate for higher production\ncost per poanc.\nIt is impossible to list here all the co:^rlercial opportunities space may offer, once transportation cost can be\nreduced in a fashion as outlined before. Realit- r will probably\ne;:ceed by far all one can figure and speculate today. The\nSpanish conquistadores, who conquered the New World five hundred\nyears ago, did not expect much more than gold, -- and what\nopportunities did actually develop!\nIt appears to be quite logical to postulate that eventually\n\'.11 industrialized nations should become vitally interested in\nthe exploration and exploitation of space! At the present the\nsmaller nations seem to be discouraged, however, because they\nsee only the monstrous chemical rockets of contemporary space\nthechnolgy and the enormous size of supporting systems. This\n\n20\nis indicated i figure 5 where the dashed line indicates the\nceiling in spending\t\nnation can afford as a reasonable fraction\nof its gross national product. Surprisingly, many Europeans\nbelieve that China eventually will develop large rocket\ncapabilities, because there are plenty of people in China and\nsufficient resources. Such c ,^^culations are based on somewhat\nold-fashioned methods by which the potential industrial power\nof a country is estimated by factors such as labor force,\nenergy production and steel production. Modern technology\ninvolves more than that; however, for brevity I will not argue\nbut leave China as a tentative partner in the club of larE;e\nrocket owners.\nIf technology would remain at the present level and if\nproductivity would not increase, there would be indeed little\nhope for smaller nations to participate on their oven in the\nconquest of space. We must e::pect, however, that technology\nwill ra.pidly develop to more compact systems involving higher\nenergy density operation. In consequence the cost for operating such systems will sufficiently decrease so that in the\ntime of advanced space technology almost every industrialized\nnation can afford a program of space e:cploitation, with the result of serious international competition.\nEstimates and speculations regarding such advanced compact\nspace tec:znolcg;; are manifold in this country. Hard facts,\nhowever, are alread y being demonstrated in the field of electronics, as shown in figure 6. If today a microelectronic\nthin film device in the size of a dime can substitute a transistor circuit in size of a cigarette box which, in turn, did substitute a. shoe box full of tubes and other clumsy gadgets of\n11 modern" electronics only ten years ago, one might reasonably\n\nwell e.-pect a s:anilar condensation of other technolo-ical\t\n\nV\n\nfunctions!\n\nIn space-flight one cannot get around the physical necessity\nof accelerating space ship and cargo up to a speed in the order\nof the escape velocity. This is equivalent with imparting an\nenergy of 100 megajoules to each kilogram of space ship and\ncargo. In figure 7 we have correlated such energies in terms\nof temperature with various characteristic speeds of technology.\nWhat one might call conventional technology falls in a regime\nterminated by the velocity of sound in this chart. Corresponding\ntemperatures are that of water vapor and flames. Space technology,\ncharacterized by the escape velocity, involves energies, which,\nif randomized, will turn each matter into a plasma. In the case\nof reentry we managed to hill that amount of energy by disloading\n\n21\nit to the atmosphere, and we produced that energy for a few\nhundred kilonrams of payload, by burning hundred of tons of\nchemicals in a near plasma state thermodynamical cycle.\nAdvances in space technology regarding increasing compactness and higher efficiency in terms of larger payload\nfractions, eery clearly depend then on the mastery of handling\nhigher energy density working fluids, - which are plasmas!\nThe relations between such higher efficiency, that is\ngreeter specific impulse, and time of acceleration, that is\nthe power orppower density, respectively, is shover. in figure\n8 (\'eference 4). It is seen in this chart that systems which\npossibly could meet the requirements of high specific impulse\nand compactness involve working fluids in the plasma state, and\nin some of the most promising schemes, such as the nuclear\ngas core rockets, the plasma physics involved appear to be the\ncrucial part in technological feasibility determination; and\nplasma technology may well become the heart pLece of actual\nsystem development!\nI think we could formulate a number of basic plasma\nresearch tasks in support of high energy densit y plasma space\nsystems, independent of any of the various itemized proposed\nadvanced rocket schemes. However, I will not elaborate on this.\nHow in detail future space systems will look is almost impossible\nto forsee, but as long as any of them will involve thermodynamics,\nit will involve plasmas!\nWe may conclude then, that plasma research constitutes\na crucial stepping stone to future space technology, and after\nthe foregoing considerations regarding the commercial conquest\nof space and the likelihood of an international competition,\nwe might also conclude that this future space technology indeed\nwill come! What the plasma physics requirements then will be\nwe do not know yet to the detail. The best vie can do at this\ntime is to learn as much as possible about the plasma., not\nonly regarding plasma technology but also in regard to space\nenvironment, in various regimes of density, with and without\nthe various boundary conditions!\nBy trying to put this meeting together, particularly when\nlooking through the collection of your abstracts, T got the\nimpression that we have done a good ,job so far. The jj,,dominant\nusefulness of our plasma research is still far ahead in the\nfuture, but certain, in my opinion. Others, however, who are\nmore concerned with the needs of the present are naturally less\nenthusiastic and if they once in a while fail to praise our work,\nlets do it ourselves!\nThank you!\n\nr\n\n2\nTTT.ITII TT\xe2\x80\xa2 11T ft\nt\n\n1.\n\n"Space Propulsion in the Fiscal Year 2001," W.
