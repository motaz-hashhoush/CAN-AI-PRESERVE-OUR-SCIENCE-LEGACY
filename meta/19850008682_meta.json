The stage is expected to meet the demands of a wide range of users. The shuttle/Centaur will be a modification of the highly successful Centaur stage, used extensively with the Atlas and Titan boosters since 1966 to launch planetary, geosynchronous and Earth orbital missions. The design changes required for use with the NSTS are described. These are primarily related to: (1) tank resizing to take advantage of the orbiter payload bay dimensions; (2) provisions for physically adopting Centaur to the orbiter; and, (3) accommodating safety requirements of the manned NSTS. The expected performance capabilities of two versions of the shuttle/Centaur are also described. The initial version, designated G-prime, is the larger of the two, with a length of about 9.1m (30 ft.). This vehicle will be used to launch the Galileo and International Solar Polar Mission to Jupiter in May 1986.", "title": "Shuttle/Centaur project perspective", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T13:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850008682, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Muckley, E.
