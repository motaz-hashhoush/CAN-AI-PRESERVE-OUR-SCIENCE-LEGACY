However, little is known about this information product in terms of its actual use, importance, and value in the transfer of federally funded R&D. To help establish a body of knowledge, the U.S. government technical report is being investigated as part of the 'NASA/DoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Research Project'. In this report, we summarize the literature on technical reprts and provide a model that depicts the transfer of federally funded aerospace R&D via the U.S. government technical report. We present results from five studies of our investigation of aerospace knowledge diffusion vis-a-vis the U.S. government technical report and close with a brief overview of on-going research into the use of the U.S. government technical report as a rhetorical device for transferring federally funded aerospace R&D.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940020187, "id": "d0a6936acdf043f3a48f0c4c102b3f06", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940020187.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940020187/downloads/19940020187.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940020187/downloads/19940020187.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940020187/downloads/19940020187.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
