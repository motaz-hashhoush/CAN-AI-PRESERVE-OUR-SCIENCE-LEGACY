Data from New Horizons will address numerous outstanding questions on the geology and composition of Pluto and Charon, plus measurements of Pluto's atmosphere, and provide revised understanding of the formation and evolution of Pluto and Charon and its smaller moons. This data set is an invaluable glimpse into the outer Third Zone of the solar system. Data from the intense July 14th fly-by sequence will be downlinked to Earth over a period of 16 months, the duration set by the large data set (over 60 GBits) and the limited transmitted bandwidth rates (approx. 1-2 kbps) and sharing the three 70 m DSN assets with our missions. The small fraction (approx. 1%) of data downlinked during the early phase of the flyby has already revealed Pluto and Charon to be very different worlds, with increasing and dynamic complexity.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150018394, "endDate": "2015-09-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "62dfc26836ad4b05a65828d85cbd94cb", "id": "592f8c3fc80e489e8406b16b29cd1798"}], "name": "Space 2015", "location": "Pasadena, CA", "id": "62dfc26836ad4b05a65828d85cbd94cb", "startDate": "2015-08-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150018394, "id": "3b291a011642498888d35e700b81171e", "publicationDate": "2015-08-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150018394.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150018394/downloads/20150018394.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150018394/downloads/20150018394.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150018394/downloads/20150018394.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
