Free expansion of the medium into a void space within the sphere was permitted. A step function temperature jump on the outer shell wall was imposed and the timewise evolution of the melting process and the position of the solid-liquid interface was photographically recorded. Numerical integration of the interface position data yielded information about the melted mass and the energy of melting. It was found that the rate of melting and the heat transfer were significantly affected by the movement of the solid medium to the base of the sphere due to gravity. The energy transfer associated with melting was substantially higher than that predicted by the conduction model. Furthermore, the radio of the measured values of sensible energy in the liquid melt to the energy of melting were nearly proportional to the Stefan number. The experimental results are in agreement with a theory set forth in an earlier paper.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900016958, "id": "6283e0e659324536bff4fc32eda792c7", "publicationDate": "1990-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900016958.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900016958/downloads/19900016958.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900016958/downloads/19900016958.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900016958/downloads/19900016958.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
