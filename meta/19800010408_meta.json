The biochemical and histochemical methods used and the experimental technique involved are described in detail. The following conclusions were formulated: (1) the successive action of cooling and immobilization results in a stronger decrease in the adrenaline and noradrenaline content in the adrenal gland than that which could be due to a simple summation of the cooling and immobilization effects; (2) successive cooling and immobilization are followed by activation of catecholamine synthesis in the adrenal gland; and (3) 1-DOPA administration (45 mg/kg 3 times in 2 days) intraabdominally activated catecholamine synthesis in the adrenal glands in both the control and test animals.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800010408, "id": "3146928f1757439f8d5998f95de7764b", "publicationDate": "1979-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19800010408.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19800010408/downloads/19800010408.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19800010408/downloads/19800010408.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19800010408/downloads/19800010408.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
