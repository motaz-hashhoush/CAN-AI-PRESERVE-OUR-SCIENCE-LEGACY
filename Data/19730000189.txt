In the case of the\nspecific conditioner for which the set was designed, it\nindicates the condition of a specific capacitor that is\nsubject to malfunction.\nA schematic of the test set is shown in the illustration.\nThe set consists of an astable multivibrator with a\n13.33% duty cycle which approximates the signal input\n\n28 V Auxilary\r\nInput\n\n.\n\nTest Set Schematic\n\n(continued overleaf)\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\t\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States \t\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nto the, conditioners in the system. The multivibrator\noscillator has an "off" voltage of abut 27 volts and an\n"on" voltage of one volt. Any intermediate voltage is\nalso possible. The output consists of a variable ampli\'\ntude waveform with logic levels compatible with standard\nconditioning equipment. Several known loads are available through a multiposition switch on the set. The\noscillator output goes to a driver stage which feeds the\nsignal conditioner under test.\nThere are several other controls and adjustments. A\nselector switch determines ac or dc power; although in\neither case 28 Vdc is available at external jacks. One fine\ncontrol adjusts the period of oscillation, another the\nduty cycle, and another adjusts the amplitude of the\nwaveform as seen by the signal conditioner. The\noscillator signal, a straight dc voltage, or no voltage at\nall may be fed to the signal conditioner by means of a\nselector switch In addition to these controls, there is\na m\xc3\xbcltipositional load switch which allows the user to\napproximate the actual load as closely as possible.\nAlthough this test set was designed for a specific\nconditioner, it may be used with any conditioner with\ncompatible logic levels by means of external jacks\nprovided to feed an input signal, a load for the conditioners, and power if needed. In any case, before using\nthe set it may be necessary to adjust the frequency or\nduty cycle if they are critical.\nAnother feature Of this test set is that it may be used\nto cycle the ground computer, if it is suspected of\nmalfunctioning, rather than to use the signal condi-\n\nB73-10189\n\n\t\n\ntio\xc3\xb1ers In this case, it may bypass the signal conditioner\nand provide a direct signal for the computer. Alternately,\nthe test set feeds signals to the conditioners and from\nthere to the ground computer.\nNotes:\n1. The only peripheral equipment needed is an oscilloscope.\n2.
