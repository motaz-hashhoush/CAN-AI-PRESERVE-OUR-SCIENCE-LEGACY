A review of the importance of the FIR lines as probes of the interstellar medium is presented. The various fine structure emission lines detected from the archetypal starburst galaxy M82, and the (C II) line radiation which is now observed toward a large variety of external galaxies are discussed. The improvements allowed by the advent of the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) are underlined.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900009830, "id": "ec2b15209c3547b4b99ae3fbaa79b946", "publicationName": "ESA, Infrared Spectroscopy in Astronomy", "publicationDate": "1989-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
