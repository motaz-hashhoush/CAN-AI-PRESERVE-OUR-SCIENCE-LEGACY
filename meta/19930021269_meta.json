This system called DuraStore uses commercially available rotary tape drive technology with ANSI/IEEE standards for automated magnetic tape based data storage. It uses a nonproprietary approach to satisfy a wide range of data rates and storage capabilities requirements and is compliant with the IEEE Network Storage Model. Rotary tape drives, standard interfaces, application specific hardware/software, networked automated tape libraries, library administrator, write protection, volume/physical media linkages, and maximum resource utilization are addressed.", "title": "GE networked mass storage solutions supporting IEEE network mass storage model", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930021269, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Herzog, Donald"}, "organization": {"name": "General Electric Co.", "location": "Camden, NJ, United States"}}, "id": "c9c73b06719d459d98bd2210d3e85697"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930021269, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930021269, "id": "6ef3c2e03391423680e84b9e7bcb63e1", "publicationName": "NASA.
