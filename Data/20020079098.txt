b"Transportation\n\nEnergq Storage Sqstem\nin 1985, SatCon Technology Corporation, Cambridge, Massachusetts develops and\nmarkets intelligent electromechanical products\nfor aerospace, industrial, transportation and\nutility applications. SatCon has worked on\nmore than 30 projects with seven NASA centers\nunder the Small Business Innovation Research\n(SBIR) program. Several of those research\nassignments, in particular two related to energy\nstorage research sponsored by Lewis Research\nCenter and Marshall Space Flight Center,\nyielded innovative technology that was later\nincorporated in SatCon's commercial Flywheel\nEnergy Storage (FES) system.\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n/\n\nA flywheel is a chemical-free mechanical\nbattery that harnesses the energy of a rapidly\nspinning wheel and stores it as electricity with\n50 times the storage capacity of a lead-acid\nbattery. Much of SatCon's work for NASA is\ndirected at developing FES systems for spacecraft attitude control and momentum recovery;\none development combines energy storage and\nspacecraft control functions in a single FES\nsystem.\nIn commercial use, FES systems have great\npotential for adding long life and extended\nrange to electric and hybrid-electric vehicles by\nproviding extra power for acceleration or hill\nclimbing, and by recovering energy normally\nlost in braking.\n\n,\n\nIn industry and utility applications, FES systems\nprovide continuous electrical power to critical\nmachines and operations during lightning\nstrikes and utility line faults. FES systems also\nsolve quality problems caused by modern, high\nfrequency switching power supplies. Additionally, in utility service, FES systems provide off-\n\npeak storage options for reducing power\ngeneration requirements to meet peak\npower demand.\n\nFlywheel Energy Stmage\ntechnology developed for\nNASA by SatCon Technology\nCorporation plays a role in the\ndrive w i n of experimental\nhybridelectric automobiles.\n\nIn August 1995, SatCon signed an agreement\nwith Westinghouse Electric Corporation,\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania for further development and commercialization of SatCon's\nflywheel technologies. The companies will\nwork together to provide low voltage solutions,\nincluding energy storage, for a variety of\nindustrial and commercial users.\n\nThe SatCon Flywheel Energy\nStmage system povides 50\ntimes the energy storage\ncapacity of a conventional\nleadacid battery.\n\n"
