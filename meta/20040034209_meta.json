Safety concerns about using OOT in critical applications, uncertainty about how to comply with regulatory requirements, and basic conservatism within the aviation community have been factors behind this caution. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have sponsored research to investigate and workshops to discuss safety and certification concerns about OOT and to develop recommendations for safe use. Two Object Oriented Technology in Aviation (OOTiA) workshops have been held and numerous issues and comments about the effect of OOT features and languages have been collected. This paper gives a high level overview of the OOTiA project, and discusses selected specific results from the March 2003 workshop. In particular, results in the form of questions to consider before making the decision to use OOT are presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040034209, "endDate": "2003-10-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"}}, "meetingId": "a3eeefdec3c14fd2a45ad460c057cfe9", "id": "dfed2e8ca4384682b87ce1073304f9e6"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "a3eeefdec3c14fd2a45ad460c057cfe9", "id": "4d02ff2c471e4fc4a373c0e44ba4310d"}], "name": "22nd Digital Avionics Systems Conference", "location": "Indianapolis, IN", "id": "a3eeefdec3c14fd2a45ad460c057cfe9", "startDate": "2003-10-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040034209, "id": "635bf71c89054a83a958817453d12753", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040034209.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040034209/downloads/20040034209.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040034209/downloads/20040034209.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040034209/downloads/20040034209.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
