Here we present efforts towards meeting this goal using Fresnel rhombs in each interferometric arm as orthogonally aligned half wave phase retarders. The milestone goal of the demonstration is to achieve 1 \u00d7 10\u22129 contrast at 2/D over a 40 nm bandpass centered at 633 nm. Rhombs have been designed and fabricated, and a multi-step approach to alignment using coarse positioners for each rhomb and pair has been developed to get within range of piezo stages used for fine positioning. The previously demonstrated narrowband VNC sensing and control approach that uses a segmented deformable mirror is being adapted to broadband to include fine positioning of the piezo-mounted rhombs, all demonstrated in a low-pressure environment.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "9605", "submissionId": 20160011216, "publisher": "SPIE", "id": "53aa119d33c44156b2feffb5b3f10252", "publicationName": "Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets VII", "publicationDate": "2015-09-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
