High-intensity ultrasonic beam techniques employ the effects of acoustic radiation pressure and acoustic streaming to manipulate the behavior of liquids. This includes propelling liquids, moving bubbles, and ejecting liquids as droplets and fountains. Since these effects can be accomplished without mechanical pumps or moving parts, we are exploring how these techniques could be used to manipulate liquids in space applications. Some of these acoustic techniques could be used both in normal Earth gravity and in the microgravity of space.", "title": "Acoustic Liquid Manipulation Used to Enhance Electrochemical Processes", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T10:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050220619, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Oeftering, Richard C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Glenn Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "e4ceb5d7c48646a2bba70f4a88909a97"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050220619, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050220619, "id": "7006673e992a414ca14f5c7773a521a5", "publicationName": "Research and Technology 2004", "publicationDate": "2005-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20050228985, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Research and Technology 2004", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050220619.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050220619/downloads/20050220619.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050220619/downloads/20050220619.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050220619/downloads/20050220619.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
