Beyermann and D. Hasen;naier\nInstitute for Inorganic Chemistry and Analytical Chemistry,\nMainz University\n/202`\nAs long as 100 years ago black-colored substances were \t\nobserved in cuttlefish fossils in places corresponding to those\nin which the ink sacs are located in recent cuttlefish. For a\nlong time the question has remained unanswered of whether this\nfossil substance is unchanged melanine or decomposition products:\nIn what follows we will discuss the analytical problems\nconnected with the identification of recent and fossil melanine.\nInfrared spectrography proves to be a suitable detection method.\neven for the fossilized ink sacs. The similar behavior of\ni\nrecent and fossilized sepia on heating can be refei ed to in\nsupport of the findings obtained spectroscopically.\nExpermintal Procedure\n\nTest Material\nFossilized sepia: ink sacs of three specimens of "cuttlefish"\nGeotheutis bollensis from the posideonian schist of the Lias\nepsilon.\t\nComparison material for determining the inorganic and\nbituminous components of the Lias schist was taken at a small\ndistance from the fossil in the fossilized layer.\nRecent sepia: a) dried sepia (made by Schwabe of Karlsruhe\nand Schminke of Dusseldorf) and ink sacs of sepia officinalis,\napproximately 4 days old, refrigerated and brought from Sapin.\n!. A discussion of the paleontological aspects will follow in an\narticle in the N. Jb. fur Geol. etc., Monthly journal, Stuttgart,\n\n(1973)\xe2\x80\xa2\n} Numbers\n\nF!\ni\n\nin the margin indicate pagination in the foreign text.\n\n1\nh.\n\nComparison substance from the muscle arms of the same sepias.\nPretreatment\nAfter drying at 100\xc2\xb0 C the material (both fossilized and\nrecent) was very finely pulverized in an agate mortar and then\nboiled with concentrated HC1 with a reflux condenser for 48\nhours. The undisolved portion was filtered off and evaporated\nwith concentrated hydrofluoric acid in a platinum crucible.\nThe black evaporation residue was rinsed with distilled water,\nextracted for 24 hours with acetone and then dried in,a drying\nchamber at 100\xc2\xb0C. (Ali the steps in this preperation process\nwere checked by infrared spectrograpt.y. There were no changes in\nthe bands typical for melanine. In this treatment, however,\nsilicate and chalk impurities as well as bituminous residues were\nlargely removed from the fossilized sepia.)\nsical Examination Methods\nInfrared spectra were taken of the dried material (KBr microbriquets). In addition, the samples were heated in each case for\n2 hours at 200 0 , 300 0 , 400\xc2\xb0, 500 0 and 600\xc2\xb0 C. Infrared spectra\nwere again taken from the treated substances after they had\ncooled. In addition, the weight loss on heating was determined\ngravimetrically.\nReflection spectra were taken in the wavelength range between\n400 and 800 nm. Moreover, NMR spectra were taken of the sepia\t\n/203\nsamples in a large variety of sol):eats. Finally, mass spectrography examinations were made.\nDissolution Tests\nSepia samples were treated with the following solutions or\n\n2\n\nJ\n\ns d ti\n\n.r\nr\n\nsolvents: saturated aqueous KOH, concentrated sulfuric acid,\nacetonnitrile, ethlyline glycol monomethylether [13], ethyline\nglycol monobutylether, ethyl acetate and benzyl alcohol [137.\nChemical Indentification Method\nOxidation and reduction experiments were done according to\nreferences [6,7,19] with solutions of KMn0 4 , H 2 0 2 , sodium\ndithionite and diamino silver chloride. Following different\n14, 20-22] sepia or sepia-free muscle\ninstructions\nsubstance with the addition of NaOH or K 2 CO 3 was oxidized in\nsolution by heating in the air at 300\xc2\xb0C or by adding KMn04.\nThe oxidation products were acidified and extracted with ether\nor ethylacetate. The extracts were released by evaporating\nfrom the solvent. The thus obtained evaporation residue was\nseparated chromatographically. The separated substances were\nmade visible by spraying with diazotized sulfanilic acid or\nFeCl 3 solution.\n\n.w\n\n13 5,\n\nResults\n\nBoth recent and fossilized melanine are soluble only in\nconcentrated sulfuric acid or in a solation of caustic potash.\nWhen dilaited with water the dissolved components -- at any rate\nonly an insignificant amount -- again precipitate. Purification\ncannot be determined by means of IR spectroscopy. All other\nsolvents -- also those recomended in the literature -- do not\ndissolve\' sepia melanine.\nIn the caae of recant se zk "a the oxidation methods coupled\n\n1,evmlte ; in spots whose position and\nwith\t\nappearance Vollt ; tt ,\twith data given in the literature.\nFossili: oA ar,t.tiu pro ju, ud no dyeable substances. Since the\ncrmplett , Cy :1t,4 , ia-free ^iuscie :\'til.ttc.uc ct\' recent cuttlefish=s\n\n3\n\n\t\n\nalso produced the same chromatography spots like sepia, it can\ncertainly be assumed that the oxidation and chromatography\nmel,hods detect protein components which are not identical with\ntht: sepia.\nThe oxidation methods with aqueous solutions of oxidants\nas well as the reduction method with sodiumdithionite did not\nproduce any utilizable findings either for recent or fossisized\t\nsepia.\n\nf!\t\n\nNMR spectroscopy in the physical examination methods did\nnot produce any usable evidence because of the insolubility of\nthe dye in the solvents. Whereas the recent sepia sample produced a mass spectrum with few lines, with the fossilized sample\nan abundance of additional lines could be seen which must be\nattributed to the bituminous impurities.\n\nl-\t\n\nThe reflection spectra of the fossilized and recent sepia\nare in complete agreement in the range from 400 to 800 nm.\nUnfortunately they show only an uncharacteristic maximum at\n560 nm.\nFig. 1 shows the infrared spectra. Fig. 2 shows the\nintensities of the band both for recent and fossilized sepia\nat 2.9 u and 6.1 U as a function of the temperature to which the\nmaterials were heated. Fig. 3. shows t ,ie ratio of the extinction\nof the bands at 2.9 u to the extinction at 6.1 u as a function\nof the heating temperature.\nDiscussion\nIn spite of the relative frequent occurence of melanines\nas dark dye pigments, the exact structure and molecular weight\nof the substances is not yet exactly known [16]. Analysis is\nmade more difficult by the fact that all natural melanines are\npractically insoluble in all solvents because the dark pigments\n\n4\n\ni\t\n\nj\t\n\n1\t\n\ni\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nw\n\nx\n\ni\n\nalways occur tightly bound with granular p.\nSynthetically produced melanines which are protein-less have\nquite different solubilities.\nBecause of this lack of solubility methods for separating\nand purifying the malanine (from protein in the case of recent\nsepia and inorganic rock impurities and bitumens in the case of\nfossilized sepia) cannot be used.\nSince the oxidative treatment methods for recent sepia\nand sepia-free musculature also produce similar results, the\nvalue of these methods for characterizing fossilized sepia is\nnot very large.\nBy contrast, infrared spectrography proves to be well suited\nfor identification of melanine. This method has already beem\nsuggested several times for identifying recent melanines [9,16,\n231, although on the other hand it has been rejected as being\nunsuitable [17]. The method was only used once for the\nidentification of fossilized sepia [14]. But in this case only\n"aliphatic compounds" were detected and "indication of the\npresence of amino compounds" were given. Spectra of fossilized\nmelanine have not been previously published.\n\nJ\n\nComparison of IR spectra of recent and fossilized melanine\n(Fig. 1) shows good agreement, also with spectra of recent\nmelanine described in the literature [16]. Just the spectrum\nof fossilized sepia additionally show the CH bands of bituminous\nimpurities at about 3.4 which also similarly appear in the\nschist impurities.\nThe proof of identity on the basis of not very characteristic\n\n/205\n\nspectra -- which, however, are only to be expected because of\nthe structure of melanine -- can be confirmed by behavior on\n\n5\n\na\n\n. . ...... .\n\nheating. Here the fossilized and recent sepia show the same\ncurves (Figs. 2 and 3). Striking here is the relatively large\nstability for an organic substance which first begins to show\ndecomposition phenomena on heating at temp eratures above\n400-500 0 C. Here too I-oth recent and fossilized sepia behave\nsimilarly.\nBy means of the suggested identification method it is also\npossible to examine undissolved samples. Because of the\nsimilar behavior on heating and the agreement of the inlrared\nspectra the conclusion suggests itself that recent and fossilized\nsepia are practically the same. Favored by ideal isolation\nconditions (isolated from the air in the oil shale) and the\nhigh degree of stability of the mielanine, the fossilized\nmaterial seems to have remained largely unchanged over a period\no\'." 180 million years.\nThe presence of organic substances in specimens as old\nas this in not completely unusual. Porphyrine-like substances\nhave been found in petroleums [1,2,11, 12]. Residues of waxes,\nscleroproteins, chitin and cellulose have been found in deposits\nwhich formed under strongly reducing conditions [11]. Amino\nacid residues have been reported in the skin substance o-I\nHolzmaden sauria [10]. However more or less largely converted\nproducts were always involved.\n\n6\n\ni\n\t\n\nA\t\no\nc E:0 1\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n:n\n\n4C I ,A\n\n.\n\n20 UI\n\nn\n--\n\n\t\n\n\t\n5 6-0\xe2\x80\x93 9 10 1\nB Sepie 1CS<f des kteinen fn^.3en l.nte ^h ,^ he \xe2\x80\xa2: nut F\nbehandelt\n\n8C\'\n\ns 60\nrn\n40\n\ny\n\n\' _\nLam_\t\n\t\n5\n9\n3 4 5 6\n7 - 4\xc2\xad10 if 12 13 14 -- 15 --1\nC Sepia rezenl mit Flu5saure behandelt\n\nFig. 1.
