In the existing read gate designs, a current is applied to all the stripes. The stripes that contain a VBL pair are chopped, while the stripes that do not contain a VBL pair are not chopped. The information is then detected by inspecting the presence or absence of the bubble. The margin of the chopping current amplitude is very small, and sometimes non-existent. A new method of reading Vertical Bloch Line memory is also disclosed. Instead of using the wall chirality to separate the two binary states, the spatial deflection of the stripe head is used. Also disclosed herein is a compact memory which uses vertical Bloch line (VBL) memory technology for providing data storage. A three-dimensional arrangement in the form of stacks of VBL memory layers is used to achieve high volumetric storage density. High data transfer rate is achieved by operating all the layers in parallel. Using Hall effect sensing, and optical sensing via the Faraday effect to access the data from within the three-dimensional packages, an even higher data transfer rate can be achieved due to parallel operation within each layer.", "title": "Vertical bloch line memory", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080004762, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Katti, Romney R."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "b60c4cae9a374f7a961234086d78a4ab"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20080004762, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stadler, Henry L."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "e8934913957a4f21b82266f7099f376e"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20080004762, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wu, Jiin-chuan"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "8df2f8f48bc74acd8212a6bb0e4d46ca"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080004762, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080004762, "id": "8d331807e8924978ab17b9986b4197e9", "publicationDate": "1995-07-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080004762.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080004762/downloads/20080004762.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080004762/downloads/20080004762.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080004762/downloads/20080004762.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
