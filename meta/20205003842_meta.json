This concept leverages elements  developed through the UAS Traffic Management project with respect to a cooperative, service-based approach that provides services and capabilities in areas (e.g., Upper E airspace) that currently receive no or limited service from Air Traffic Control. This concept is meant to provide a safe, fair, and scalable approach to management of Upper E operations that reduces the burden on ATC while providing the flexibility and access desired by current and new users of the airspace. This set of slides includes a presentation of Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance assessments as they relate to the ETM environment, a review of Industry thoughts on equitable airspace access and associated rules of the road, and an initial presentation of the separation assurance process and related negotiation aspect.", "isLessonsLearned": true, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20205003842, "endDate": "2020-06-18T07:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "7f9c4cf9cb6f517db6b0fb40eb584c03", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Ames Research Center", "location": "Mountain View, California, United States"}}, "meetingId": "fff8eb56d6e843e7bb6b338d70b1fa73", "id": "14bf76c0dfa240d0990d58895b1fc6a1"}], "name": "Upper E Traffic Management virtual meeting", "location": "Moffett Field, CA", "id": "fff8eb56d6e843e7bb6b338d70b1fa73", "startDate": "2020-06-18T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Upper_E_06182020_Release_v2.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205003842/downloads/Upper_E_06182020_Release_v2.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205003842/downloads/Upper_E_06182020_Release_v2.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205003842/downloads/Upper_E_06182020_Release_v2.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
