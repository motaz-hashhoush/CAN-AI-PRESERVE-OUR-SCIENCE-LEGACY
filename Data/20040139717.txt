Understanding is usually (but not always) superior\nio handbooks and is required (unless dumb luck intervenes) for\ninnovation. And, in any case, all welders by nature desire to know. A\nbit of history of the rise and fall of the VPPA process in fabrication of\nthe Space Shuttle External Tank is included.\n\nPreliminaries: What is an arc?\nInert gases used in welding, helium and argon, are made up of loose\natoms flying around and banging against themselves and the walls of\ntheir container. At high temperatures the atoms speed up and\nnegatively charged electrons are knocked off the atoms. A plasma is\na kind of soup of little, fast-moving, negative electrons, neutral atoms,\nand big, slow-moving, positively charged ions (what\xe2\x80\x99s left of an atom\nafter electrons have been knocked off. Plasmas are neutral because\nthe charge of the ions and electrons balance, but because the\nelectrons (especially) and the ions can move independently, plasmas\nconduct electricity like metals.\nPlasmas can be started by applying a high electric field to a gas. The\nelectric field (volts per distance) picks up a stray electron (There\xe2\x80\x99s\nalways a few of these around.) and slams it into a neutral atom hard\nenough to knock out more electrons. An electron avalanche takes\nplace and starts a plasma. This happens when an arc is struck. A\nhigh frequency current can do it, too.\n\nA plasma cools off, the electrons move more slowly and are\nrecaptured, and the plasma is no more unless the energy loss to its\nsurroundings is replenished. A voltage imposed on a plasma\naccelerates the conducting charges and can maintain a plasma\nindefinitely. A welding arc is a plasma maintained between oppositely\ncharged electrodes. In the GTA process one electrode is a tungsten\nrod; the other is the workpiece.\n\nThe arc column itself is hot, say 10,000 to 20,000 \xe2\x80\x9cC. A voltage drop\nof around one volt per millimeter is typical for an arc column. Thus if\nthe arc is conducting a 100 amp current, about 100 watts of power is\nneeded to maintain a millimeter of arc column, around the same as a\nlight bulb. The really important voltage drops, through which the\nelectrodes are heated, occur at the electrodes. This will be discussed\nbelow.\nHow a PAW Torch Works\nA plasma torch is like a little rocket engine. The plasma is initiated by\na high frequency AC voltage in a chamber inside the torch in an inert\n\xe2\x80\x9cplasma gas.\xe2\x80\x9d As the plasma gas is fed into the chamber it heats up\nand expands as well as ionizes. The hot gas rushes out through a\nwater-cooled nozzle as a plasma jet.\n\nThe plasma jet can be used directly as a heat source, but usually the\narc is transferred to the workpiece. The internal \xe2\x80\x9cpilot arc\xe2\x80\x9d is no longer\nnecessary once the transference takes place. The transferred arc still\nheats the plasma gas inside the torch and the plasma gas still rushes\nout as a plasma jet.\n\nKeyholing\nThe plasma jet makes a particularly stable arc with less tendency to\nwander erratically and somewhat greater concentration than a GTAW\narc. It is not so sensitive to standoff distance as is a GTAW torch. But\nespecially useful is the ability to operate in the \xe2\x80\x9ckeyhole\xe2\x80\x9d mode.\n\nThe plasma jet has kinetic energy that produces a pressure when it\nimpinges against a weld pool. The pressure is enough to push a\ncentimeter or two into a pool o liquid metal, so that a plasma arc can\nf\npenetrate into the workpiece like an electron beam or a laser,\nalthough the penetration mechanism is not the same. Hence plasma\narc welds can be deeper and narrower than GTA welds. The number\nof weld passes can be reduced in changing from GTAW to PAW.\nWhen the PAW process is operated with the arc penetrating all the\nway through the workpiece the operation is said to be in the\n\xe2\x80\x9ckeyholing\xe2\x80\x9d mode. The arc impinges on the forward surface of the\n\xe2\x80\x9ckeyhole.\xe2\x80\x9d Melted metal flows around the sides of the keyhole and the\nstreams join behind the keyhole. (The flow of metal is driven by\nvariations in surface tension with temperature, i.e. thermocapillary\nforces.)\nIn metals that form tenacious oxides, or sometimes due to\ncontamination in spite of the shield gas used to envelope and protect\nthe keyhole, an oxide layer reminiscent of plastic wrap covers the\nconverging streams of molten metal. A lumpy non-weld results.\nBut keyholing has a tendency to blow away weld seam contaminants.\nWhere weld seam contamination is a problem PAW in the keyholing\nmode might be considered. Porosity in aluminum alloys might be\nreduced in this way. In the latter case special measures need to be\ntaken to avoid problems from the tenacious oxide on the surface of\naluminum.\n\nPolarity and Why It Matters\nAt the cathode or negative electrode the temperature must be high\nenough so that the electron emission process keeps the arc supplied.\nOtherwise the arc goes out. The needed heat is generated when the\ncooled end of the arc increases in resistance and produces a voltage\ndrop. The heat replenishes the heat conducted away by the electrode\nmetal, the energy required to pull each electron out of the metal, and\nthe energy required to heat each electron to the plasma temperature.\n\nThe energy to pull an electron out of a metal is expressed as a\nvoltage drop called the \xe2\x80\x9cwork function.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAt the anode or positive electrode the heat that must be supplied to\nmaintain equilibrium is approximately (neglecting thermal radiation\neffects) the heat conducted away\xe2\x80\x99 by the electrode metal. Besides\nheat generated by the higher resistance of a locally cooled plasma,\nheat is brought to the surface by the amount of the energy gained\nwhen an electron enters the electrode metal (work function) and by\nthe greater plasma temperature of the entering electrons.\nBecause the electrons extract heat from the cathode and deliver heat\nto the anode, the welding process is considered to be more efficient\nwhen operated in \xe2\x80\x9cstraight polarity,\xe2\x80\x9d when the torch electrode is\nnegative, the workpiece positive, and electrons fiow to the workpiece.\nUnless there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason not to, welding torches are operated in the\nstraight polarity mode.\nBut there is a reason to weld in \xe2\x80\x9creverse polarity,\xe2\x80\x9d where the electrons\nflow away from the workpiece: the cathodic cleaning effect. A high\nspeed movie of the vicinity of a GTA weld pool in the reverse polarity\nmode will reveal a display of sparkling points of light, miniature\nexplosions continually occurring all over the surface. This is thought\nto be caused by electrostatic breakdown of a thin surface oxide layer.\nThe positive ions in the arc accumulate on the surface of the oxide\nlayer and induce a balancing negative charge. If the oxide layer is\nthin, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take a lot of charge to produce an electric field (volts\nper distance) big enough to cause the oxide layer to break down in a\nmini-explosion. Cleaned surface is distinct and visible around the\ncrown of a weld made in reverse polarity.\nBut to get the cleaning necessary to weld aluminum alloys one takes\na hit in power available for welding, and the effective capability of the\nmachine is reduced.\nVariable Polarity PAW or VPPAW\n\n,\n\n.\n\n* \xe2\x80\x98\n\nTotal reverse polarity is not necessary to get the requisite cleaning\naction to weld aluminum alloys. Alternating current has been used for\nGTA welding of aluminum alloys since the 1940\xe2\x80\x99s. A square-wave\nGTA power supply with the more efficient ratio of 1 or 2 cycles\nreverse polarity to 10 cycles straight polarity was available by the late\n1960\xe2\x80\x99s.\nTo the author\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge B.P. VanCleave at Boeing Co. first applied\nthe variable polarity principle to PAW welding in the late 1960\xe2\x80\x99s and\nearly 1970\xe2\x80\x99s. In the late 1970\xe2\x80\x99s and early 1980\xe2\x80\x99s VPPA welding was\ndeveloped at Marshall Space Flight Center for application to the\nSpace Shuttle External Tank. It was thought it would save a good\ndeal of time spent fixing welds containing porosity. A good cycle for\nthe square wave power supply was found to be 4 milliseconds\nreverse polarity to 19 milliseconds straight polarity. The cycle\nproduces a characteristic buzzing sound.\nThings that can go wrong\nDuring development of a VPPA system an ill-conceived design\nchange produced \xe2\x80\x9cthe torch that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shield.\xe2\x80\x9d It was fixed. Dark\nlines began to show up on radiographs without obvious correlative\nphysical features. Such a thing is called an \xe2\x80\x9denigma.\xe2\x80\x9d The enigma\nwas explained. Meanwhile the VPPA system was producing fine\nwelds.\nEventually a new aluminum-lithium alloy was specified for the new\nLight Weight Space Shuttle External Tank. This alloy was difficult to\nfusion weld. It tended to crack. A new solid-state process, Friction Stir\nWelding, came under development to replace the VPPA process.\nNothing lasts forever. But Friction Stir Welding is not scheduled to fly\nfor 2 or 3 years and even then some welds will continue to be made\nby the VPPA process to the end of the program. Friction Stir Welding\nhas limitations of its own, too.\n\n'
