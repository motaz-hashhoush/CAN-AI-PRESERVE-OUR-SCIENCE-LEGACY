Activity began on May 26 and has continued at least through May 30. Triangulation with Ulysses and BATSE gives a preliminary annulus whose center is at R.A. = 2lh58ml8s, Decl. = -11ol8'.4 (equinox 2000.0), and whose radius is 47.269 +/- 0.019 deg. This annulus includes the network synthesis error box (Hurley et al. 1994, Ap.J. 431, L31), the ROSAT source proposed as a possible quiescent x-ray counterpart to the soft repeater, and the peculiar double M star system coincident with the ROSAT source. As all these locations are mutually consistent, we conclude that the ROSAT source and M star system are indeed the counterparts to the soft gamma-ray repeater, and urge that observations at other wavelengths be undertaken immediately, while the source remains active. An image may be found at http://ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/sgrl9OO+l4/. On May 30, BATSE triggered on an extremely intense outburst from this source that comprised at least 38 bursts of varying intensity and duration; the series of bursts started at May 30.37759 UT and lasted for about 350 s. The peak flux of each of the three major bursts in the series is 1.1 x lOE-4 erg cmE-2 sE-1 (between 25 and 300 keV, integrated for 128 ms). Assuming a distance of about 12 kpc for SGR 1900+14, this corresponds to a luminosity of about 2 X 10(exp 42) ergs / second for each burst. This bunching of emission is very similar to the behavior of SGR 1806-20 as detected with the Rossi X-ray Timing explorer in 1996. Overall, between May 26 and June 1, we have detected over 50 bursts from SGR 1900+4. The frequency and intensity of emissions are unlike any previously seen behavior from this source. Follow-up observations at infrared and radio wavelengths, while the source is still active are encouraged.", "title": "SGR 1900+14", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T10:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990103099, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hurley, K."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL United States"}}, "id": "d07e9e2060b147cfa3868b3ff2f9155e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19990103099, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Woods, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama Univ.", "location": "Huntsville, AL United States"}}, "id": "c8fddb0d07f643ccbaca9f9091d22a72"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19990103099, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kippen, R.
