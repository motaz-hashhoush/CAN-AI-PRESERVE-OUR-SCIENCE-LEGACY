It was defined via the integral of dl/l to which Ludwik gave the name \"effective specific strain.\" Today, it is after Hencky, who extended Ludwik's measure to three-dimensional analysis by defining logarithmic strains for the three principal directions.", "title": "Natural Strain", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050180483, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Freed, Alan D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "146dc82bb7e64e7181debf7a149af372"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050180483, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050180483, "id": "59ade6337202472aa35e9bfa05542d2b", "publicationName": "Research and Technology 1996", "publicationDate": "1997-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050180483.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050180483/downloads/20050180483.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050180483/downloads/20050180483.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050180483/downloads/20050180483.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
