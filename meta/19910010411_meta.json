The present generation is ok for small projects, but not so good for large projects. They are not good for addressing the iterative nature of requirements, resolution, and implementation. They do not address complexity issues of requirements stabilization. They do not explicitly address reuse opportunities, and they do not help with people shortages. Therefore, there is a need to define and automate improved software engineering processes. Some help may be gained by reuse and prototyping, which are two sides of the same coin. Reuse library parts are used to generate good approximations to desired solutions, i.e., prototypes. And rapid prototype composition implies use of preexistent parts, i.e., reusable parts.", "title": "The next generation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:21:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910010411, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yudkin, Howard"}, "organization": {"name": "Software Productivity Consortium", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "id": "e77822d89f4844b7ace0d7a7bb9fe706"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910010411, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910010411, "id": "8a43395f0b1f49e8911f0e0a5599fb59", "publicationName": "Houston Univ., RICIS 1988 Symposium Proceedings.
