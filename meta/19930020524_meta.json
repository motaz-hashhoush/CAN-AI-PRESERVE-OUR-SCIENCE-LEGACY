This project is geared to designing an aircraft that can study the ozone layer. The aircraft must be able to satisfy four mission profiles. The first is a polar mission that ranges from Chile to the South Pole and back to Chile, a total range of 6000 n.m. at 100,000 ft with a 2500-lb payload. The second mission is also a polar mission with a decreased altitude and an increased payload. For the third mission, the aircraft will take off at NASA Ames, cruise at 100,000 ft, and land in Chile. The final mission requires the aircraft to make an excursion to 120,000 ft. All four missions require that a subsonic Mach number be maintained because of constraints imposed by the air sampling equipment. Three aircraft configurations were determined to be the most suitable for meeting the requirements. The performance of each is analyzed to investigate the feasibility of the mission requirements.", "title": "High-altitude reconnaissance aircraft", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930020524, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yazdi, Renee Anna"}, "organization": {"name": "California State Polytechnic Univ.", "location": "Pomona, CA, United States"}}, "id": "1d44ed15e3fc4cacacbf5aa41074aaaf"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930020524, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930020524, "id": "2778509a47b9492b9c15a3ebdb34bc22", "publicationName": "Universities Space Research Association, Houston, Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Summer Conference.
