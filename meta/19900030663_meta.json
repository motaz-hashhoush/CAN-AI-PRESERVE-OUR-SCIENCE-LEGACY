Doses from trapped solar radiation and galactic cosmic radiation are covered, and also those to be expected from anomalous, large solar particle events. They are compared with the maximum annual and career doses laid down by the National Council on Radiation protection (1987). The effect of spacecraft and space suit shielding is also considered. Space Shuttle flights have allowed extensive comparison of predicted doses with those measured experimentally. This has revealed some defects in the radiation and magnetic fields models used and has led to extensive reexamination of these models.", "title": "Radiation hazards in low earth orbit, polar orbit, geosynchronous orbit, and deep space", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T10:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900030663, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mccormack, Percival D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Life Sciences Div.", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "613b78c59ed440588bfd59e94fb708c6"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900030663, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900030663, "id": "40313f72bc56406c9fa8bfe2d81afce9", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
