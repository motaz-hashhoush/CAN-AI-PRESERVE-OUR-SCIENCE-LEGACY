The optical link spans a range of 45 Km at an average altitude of 2 Km above sea level. A multi-beam beacon comprised of eight laser beams emerging from multi-mode fiber coupled lasers (780 nm) are launched through a 0.6 m diameter telescope located at the JPL Table Mountain Facility (TMF) in Wrightwood, California. The multibeam beacon is received at Strawberry Peak located in the San Bernadino Mountains of California. The NASA, JPL developed optical communications demonstrator (OCD) receives the beacon, senses the atmosphere induced motion and using an upgraded fine steering loop compensates the re-transmission of a communications laser beam (852 nm, 400 Mbps) to TMF. The eight-beam beacon allowed a four reduction in normalized irradiance or scintillation index. This in turn was sufficient to eliminate beacon fades sensed b  the OCD and allowed the fine steering loop performance evaluation. The uncompensated tracking error was determined to be 2.2 - 3 prad compared to a model prediction of 3.4 prad. The paper also discusses various auxiliary observations made during the campaign", "title": "45 Km horizontal path optical link demonstrations", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210001773, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Page, Norman A."}}, "id": "9443577c50e14afe8ce9372178f3bd0f"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210001773, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sanii, Babak"}}, "id": "a9538840e3a74300a852618a0774807e"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210001773, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wright, Malcolm W."}}, "id": "a73e2814987d494ebf42a38ef56a5326"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210001773, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Biswas, Abhijit"}}, "id": "8ddef9c8e22542fca3e6b4241f7a86b6"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T04:12:43.1385560+00:00", "id": 20210001773, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/39242", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210001773, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA : Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2001.", "id": "54d346f9692e462e9682270bfdea2d6e", "publicationDate": "2001-01-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
