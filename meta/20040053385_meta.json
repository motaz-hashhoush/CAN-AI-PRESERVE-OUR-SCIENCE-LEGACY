I had hired Kurt six years ago and found him to be a man of few words but huge actions. Kurt had single-handedly created two new business areas in the company and made a significant contribution to the upcoming Mars Exploration. While running in the mountains, Kurt had a fatal heart attack. An avid back country skier and climber, he was 45 years old and appeared in great health. I spoke honestly from my heart, and from my own experience as a father. That day people started to ask what they could do to help the family. Over the next couple days we set up a fund where people could contribute dollars or vacation time or comp time, and Starsya would translate that into equivalent dollars and provide a matching contribution.", "title": "Fly Away", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T17:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20040053385, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tibbitts, Scott"}, "organization": {"name": "Starsys Research Corp.", "location": "Boulder, CO, United States"}}, "id": "c36477b85b6640598d8fffba63a0d648"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-03-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20040053385, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040053385, "id": "94181a4face447b983169bc328a0fa6c", "publicationName": "ASK Magazine, No. 16", "publicationDate": "2004-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20040053380, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "ASK Magazine", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040053385.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040053385/downloads/20040053385.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040053385/downloads/20040053385.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040053385/downloads/20040053385.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
