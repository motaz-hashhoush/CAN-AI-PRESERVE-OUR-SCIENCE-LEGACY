Land use imagery is applicable to land use classification for small scale land use mapping less than 1:250,000. Land use mapping by satellite is more efficient and more cost-effective than land use mapping from conventional medium altitude aerial photographs. Six categories of level 1 land use classification are recognizable from MSS imagery. A hydrogeomorphological study of the Han River basin indicates that band 7 is useful for recognizing the soil and the weathering part of bed rock. The morphological change of the main river is accurately recognized and the drainage system in the area observed is easily classified because of the more or less simple rock type. Although the direct hydrological characteristics are not obtained from the MSS imagery, the indirect information such as the permeability of the soil and the vegetation cover, is helpful in interpreting the hydrological aspects.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790005254, "id": "a928593e0fb14a5b95613e4a9070e16d", "publicationDate": "1978-08-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790005254.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790005254/downloads/19790005254.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790005254/downloads/19790005254.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790005254/downloads/19790005254.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
