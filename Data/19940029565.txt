If the recommendations are implemented,\nthey will provide world-class capability where it is vital to\nour country\'s needs and make us more efficient in meeting\nfuture needs.\nAERONAUTICS\n\nFACILITIES\n\nTwo New Wind Tunnels Are Needed\nDominant among the new needs is the development of\ntwo wind tunnels primarily for future generations of commercial jet transports. These tunnels, one subsonic and the\nother transonic, would provide a combination of flight\ncondition simulation and testing turnaroundspeed unmatched\nin this country or at any facilities abroad. Based on private\nindustry\'s projections, they should be on-line around the\nyear 2000 to provide the U.S. with the competitive edge\nneeded for the next round of wide-body commercial transport competition. Site selection, when made, should be\nbased both upon construction and operational cost considerations. We should move forward aggressively to put this\nvital new capability in place for our country.\nAlthough aeronautics research and development (R&D)\nrequirements were focussed primarily on development facilities for subsonic and transonic aircraft with primary\nemphasis on commercial needs, these tunnels would provide added value for military development. Requirements\nwere also projected for hypersonic vehicles and propulsion\nneeds throughout the flight regimes. Facility consolidation\nand closure options were addressed, including definitions\nof an action timetable.\nSPACE\n\na payback time for the investment of less than two years.\nAlthough the NFS has not included the cost and savings of\nthe on-going USAFRange Standardization and Automation\nProgram, the Range Operations Control Center, and the\nCentaur Processing Facility upgrade, their concepts and\nobjectives are sound and we endorse these very large modernization programs.\n\nR&D/OPERATIONS\n\nFACILITIES\n\nOptions for Consolidation\nor Improving\nEffectiveness\nwere Evaluated\nExcess facility capacity was identified and opportunities for improving effectiveness through consolidation and\nshared usage were identified. Facility shortcomings were\nalso identified and recommendations are included for meeting these needs.\nSeventy individual consolidation or closure recommendations have been collected, analyzed and validated.\nThese include recommendations developed by the NFS\nTask Team and also endorsement of options or plans which\nare in some state of development by a specific agency, thus\nindicating a degree of receptivity already.\nCost savings and implementation costs have been determined for the recommended options. If they are implemented, the savings are estimated at $114M annually with\n-1-\n\nAdditional options have been collected but not yet\nsufficiently analyzed to allow a definitive recommendation.\nReliance upon excess capacity at private industry sites has\nalso not been fully explored. Recommendations are provided for continuing evaluation.\nA Comprehensive\nDeveloped\n\nFacility\n\nInventory\n\nwas\n\nIn undertaking this study, aerospace facility inventories were found to be incomplete and outdated. The NFS\nTask Team developed a comprehensive computerized inventory of aerospace facilities at major NASA, DoD, DOE,\nNOAA, and industrial sites. The inventory data includes\nfacility characteristics, performance features, an estimation\nof percent utilization, and contact points for additional\ninformation. The database contains over 2800 facilities and\nis still growing as additional government and industrial\norganizations provide inputs.\nA Future Mission\nDeveloped\n\nand Requirements\n\nModel\n\nwas\n\nAnother key need was to obtain a mission model for\nassessing future aerospace facility requirements.\nA projection of future space mission requirements was\ndeveloped for NFS analysis that embraces military, civilian\ngovernment and commercial sectors to help determine what\nand how much of the inventory is expected to be needed.\nThe mission model was constructed as a middle ground\nbaseline with projections extended to 2023 because of the\nlong lead time of certain facility related issues. Several\nexcursions to the baseline were defined to test the sensitivity\nof facility recommendations to the baseline mission model.\nThe NFS Task Team urges that the recommendations\nbe considered seriously by the responsible organizations\nand incorporated, or improved on, where possible. We stand\nready to help with reviews and to support implementation\nplanning where appropriate.\nThe momentum should not be lost; the data and tools\ndeveloped during this study should be part of a continued\neffort to align our country\'s facilities to evolving national\nneeds and to improve our efficiency.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe United States aerospace industry has been subject\nto increasing challenge by international advances in aerospace technology that affect its ability to maintain its competitive position in the global marketplace. These advances\nare paced by modern, highly productive research, development, and operational facilities. A National Facilities Study\n(NFS) has been undertaken to formulate a coordinated\nnational plan for aeronautical and space facilities that meet\ncurrent and projected government and commercial needs.\nA Terms of Reference (TOR) document was developed\nfor the study (Appendix A). This formalized an Oversight\nGroup, chaired by the NASA Associate Deputy Administrator, with the Department of Defense (DoD) Director, Test\nand Evaluation, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense\n(Acquisition and Technology), serving as Vice-Chairman,\nand with representation from other DoD and NASA offices,\nthe Department of Commerce (DOC), Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Transportation (DOT).\nThe study plan considers current and future government and commercial needs as well as DoD and NASA\nmission requirements through the year 2023. It addresses\nshortfalls in existing capabilities, new facility requirements,\nupgrades, consolidations,\nand phase out of existing\nfacilities.\nSTUDY\n\nthe time these people took from their schedules to help with\nthis study.\nIndustry inputs and advice were solicited in various\nways during the course of the study. In the case of the\nAeronautics R&D Task Group with its special need to\naddress commercial transport aircraft, experts from private\nindustry participated as Special Government Employees,\nconsistent with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The\nAerospace Industries Association was used to help establish\ncontacts related to space facilities, and a special Industry\nForum was organized atthe Kennedy Space Center to gather\nspecific company comments.\nThe National Research Council/Aeronautics and Space\nEngineering Board was requested to review the results of\nthe NFS and offer an independent perspective and evaluation. They responded by establishing Aeronautics Facilities\nand Space Facilities subcommittees, each of which interacted with the NFS Task Groups, providing valuable commentary as the study progressed. They will issue reports in\nthe June toJuly 1994 time period following their evaluation.\nThe study results, including the results of an addendum\nstudy instituted to evaluate additional facility options, are\noverviewed in this Summary Report. The following five\nseparate volumes provide details and backup information:\n\nAPPROACH\n\nThe National Facilities Study Team was established in\nearly 1993 with a director and four task groups as listed in\nAppendix B. The task groups were Aeronautics R&D,\nSpace R&D, Space Operations, and Facilities Costing and\nEngineering. Each group was co-chaired by senior NASA\nandDoD leaders. Working groups supported the task groups\nin key specialty areas. The task groups had the responsibility for planning, directing, and providing recommendations\nin their particular areas of discipline for a plan which meets\nNational aeronautics and space requirements and minimizes duplication of effort.\nThe situations in aeronautics R&D, and in space R&D/\noperations are quite different. It was recognized early in the\nstudy that there was an urgent need for new test facilities to\nsupport commercial air transport development, and the\nstudy emphasized that. In space there is some overcapacity,\nand the study emphasized this, although selected new\ncapabilities are also recommended where the payoff is\nsubstantial.\nMembers of the National Facilities Study Task Team\nmade on-site visits to key facilities. The task team surveyed\nthe facilities and interacted with key personnel at the sites to\nobtain firsthand information. We are very appreciative of\n-2-\n\nVolume 1: Inventory\nVolume 2: Aeronautics R&D\nVolume 3: Mission & Requirements Model\nVolume 4: Space Operations\nVolume 5: Space R&D\n\nINVENTORY\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nIt was clear early in the effort that an inventory\nof\nexisting aerospace facilities had to be developed to perform\nthe study. The scope had to include Aeronautics\nR&D,\nSpace R&D and Space Operations\nfacilities.\nSignificant\nfacilities in both government\nand private industry needed to\nbe identified and categorized.\n\n#Sites\nNASA\nDoD\nDOE\n\n11\n30\n10\n\nNOAA\nThe Facilities/Engineering\nand Costing Task Group\nand the other Task Groups jointly developed a three-page\nformat for the inventory.\nIt includes a brief description\nof\nthe facility, key operating parameters, capabilities,\norder of\nmagnitude\ncost data, degree of utilization,\nand point of\ncontact for additional\ninformation.\nData\n\nwere\n\nsolicited\n\nfrom\n\nall NASA\n\ncenters,\n\nDOE,\n\nNOAA, and from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Advanced\nResearch Projects Agency,\nand the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.\nIndustry participation\nwas assisted by\nthe Aerospace\nIndustries\nAssociation\nand the American\nInstitute of Aeronautics\nand Astronautics,\nleading to direct\ninteraction with key companies. Each site (private industry\nor government)\nwas provided\na standardized\ndata input\npackage to report the characteristics\nof its facilities.\nGuidelines\n\nwere issued\n\nto limit the data inputs to the\n\nmore significant key facilities. This still resulted in more\nfacilities than could be evaluated in the time available, and\napproaches\nwere developed\nby the task groups\nthe areas most likely to pay off.\nThe information\n\nreturned\n\nto focus on\n\nfrom the responding\n\nsites was\n\nmerged into a single, comprehensive\ninventory, resident in\na computer database for ease of access to the information.\nThe database provided\na number of analytical tools and\ncapabilities\nto assist the task groups in performing\ntheir\nstudies.\nData loading was, and still is, a dynamic process. Data\nwere received at various times throughout the course of the\nstudy, and the database was appended\nwas received.\n\nas each new data set\n\nThe NFS facility inventory is now the most comprehensive source of information concerning aeronautics and aerospace related facilities available.\nThe inventory\ncontains\ndetailed information\non 2,823 facilities from 78 sites. This\nrepresents over 8,000 pages of information.\nThe following\ntable summarizes\nthe number of facilities contained in the\ndatabase\n\nby agency\n\nand industry:\n\n-3-\n\n3\n\nIndustry\nTOTAL\n\n*Some\nreleaseable.\n\ndata\n\n24\n78\n\nare\n\nproprietary\n\n# Facilities\n1,044\n694\n130\n51\n904\n2,823*\n\nand,\n\ntherefore,\n\nnot\n\nAERONAUTICS\n\nR&D FACILITIES\n\nThe United States commercial jet transport industry\nneeds a major improvement in subsonic and transonic wind\ntunnel testing capability in order to compete effectively in\nthe international market place. For many years, the U.S. has\nenjoyed significant economic benefit and military air superiority as a result of preeminence in aviation. In terms of\neconomic impact, U.S. aviation industry sales exceeded $90\nbillion in 1991 and brought $28 billion to the U.S. in\npositive balance of trade, the largest of any industrial sector\nin the economy. Over 1 million high-quality jobs resulted.\nThe outlook is even more impressive with future sales\npotential of $815 billion by 2010, and 65 percent of the sales\nbeing for foreign airlines, as shown in Figure 1.\nThe economic significance of aeronautics has not been\nlost on other countries, and in the past 20 years several\ncountries have taken a very aggressive approach to establishing themselves as important competitors. Their successes are mirrored by the decline in the U.S. share of the\nglobal market. Since 1969, the U.S. share of the jet transport\nmarket has dropped by 30 percent and is predicted to\ncontinue to drop as shown in Figure 2 unless a vigorous\nprogram is undertaken to reverse this trend.\nThe Task Group on Aeronautics R&D Facilities examined the status and requirements for aeronautics facilities\n\nagainst the competitive need. Emphasis was placed on\nground-based facilities for subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics, and propulsion. Subsonic and transonic wind tunnels were judged to be most critical and of\nhighest priority due to their potential for impacting the\nmarket share. In this regard, the industry estimates that a 9.\n15 percent improvement in cruise and take off/landing\nperformance is available and could be achieved with new\nhigh Reynolds numberhigh productivity wind tunnels.\nThis is important because a 10 percent improvement in\nperformance could result in an $80 billion increase in\nmarket share over the next 16 years and reductions in\noperator costs orS10 million for each year per new aircraft\nin commercial airline operation.\nFACILITY\n\nSURVEY/COMPARISON\n\nAND\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nSubsonicTransonic\nAn extensive inventory of worldwide wind tunnel facilities and their pertinent attributes has been accomplished\nin the study.

These\ncore facilities are owned by the U.S. Government, U.S.\nindustry,\n\nand foreign\n\ninterests.\n\nThree primary considerations\nwere used in selecting\nthe core facilities:\ncapability (characterized\nby the aerodynamic parameter Reynolds number), productivity,\nand operating cost. The comparison\nmetrics, maximum Reynolds\nnumber of the facility, productivity\nin terms of polars per\noccupancy hour (a polar is defined as 25 data points, each\npoint being obtained at a single value of an independent\nvariable),\nand test costs in terms of dollars per polar are\nincluded in the figure. In general, the data show that the\nhigher the Reynolds number the lower the productivity\nand\nthe higher the operating costs. The more modern European\ntunnels have achieved a better balance than the U.S. tunnels\nof capability, productivity,\nand cost, although the Ames 12Foot Tunnel which is being rebuilt and will be reactivated\nin 1995, will have comparable\nmetrics to the European\nsubsonic\ntunnels. All of the world\'s subsonic\ntunnels,\nhowever, have serious limitations for the development\nof\nthe complex high-llft systems to be implemented\non future\naircraft.

To meet the needs most effectively, as shown in Figure 4, these tunnels should be on line\nby the year 2000 or as near thereafter as possible.\nThe Aeronautics Task Group, through a process of\ninteraction with the nation\'s aeronautical experts, and analysis of the available data, arrived at target performance\nrequirements for flow quality, productivity and cost:\nReynolds number of 30 million, productivity at least 2 times\ngreater than existing wind tunnels, and operating cost equal\nto or less than that of current major wind tunnels. Comparing these requirements with those of the "core" development facilities in Figure 3 leads to the conclusion that no\nU.S. facilities have the combination of capability, productivity, and cost metrics to provide the American aircraft\nindustry with the technology that will permit U.S. fwms to\ncompete effectively.\nIn order to maintain and improve the competitive\nposition of the U.S. aircraft industry, it was a consensus of\nindustry and government that improvements to existing\nnational facilities will not suffice. The need exists for new\nwtnd tunnels with substantial increases in capability at\nsubsonic and transonic speeds. They must provide Reynolds\nnumbers above the threshold level at an operating cost equal\nto or less than the wind tunnels used today. The low\noperating costs can be achieved through high productivity\nlevels.\n\nblew Wind Tunnels - The recommended approach\nresults from substantial cost-benefit analysis between these\noptions and the goals. The Low-Speed Wind Tunnel provides for efficient high Reynolds number testing (20 million\non full span models at a Mach number of 0.3 as shown in\nFigure 5). The goal in Reynolds number of 30 million is\nachieved through the use of semi-span (large, half vehicle)\nmodels. It meets the productivity and cost metrics. The\nTransonic Wind Tunnel meets the goal of 30 million\nReynolds number at a Mach number of 1 with full-span\nmodels as shown in Figure 6. It also meets the productivity\nand cost metrics.\nThe Aeronautics Task Group, through a process of\ninteraction with the nation\' s aeronautical experts and analysis\nof the available data, arrived at a set of target performance\nrequirements as follows: ability to test at full scale Reynolds\nnumber for some existing airplanes which will provide a\nbaseline for extrapolation on largerairplanes (approximately\n30 million, both subsonic and transonic); productivity of 2\nto 2 1/2 times existing wind tunnels (5 polars per occupancy\nhour subsonic and 8 polars per occupancy hour transonic);\noperation cost equal to or less than current wind tunnels\n($1000 per polar subsonic and $2000 per polar transonic);\ngood flow quality; accessibility; and, acoustic treatment.\nFigure 7 shows the new wind tunnel complex which will\nmeet these new commercial jet transport needs. A removable\nplenum section is used to facilitate the interchange of test\n\nFigure 4.

The\nrequirements\nfor the HSCT can be met with the presently\navailable\nsupersonic\nfacilities if proposed\nimprovements\n\nare made to the AEDC\n\n16S Supersonic\n\nWind Tunnel. Flight\n\ntesting will be used to supplement the tunnel testing. There\nis a need to develop Supersonic Laminar Flow Control\n(SLFC) which is expected to significantly\nreduce HSCT\noperating costs. Until a new low-turbulence\nsupersonic\ntunnel can be designed, research and development\nshould\nbe funded for "quiet\'flow\nsupersonic\nwind tunnels, which\nwill allow development\nof this key technology\nfor future\naircraft.\nPropulsion\n\nfacility infrastructure has been\n\na major factor in U.S. competitiveness\nin the area of\ncommercial\naircraft engines.\nContinued\nadvances\nin\npropulsion\ntechnology\nare critical to improving\ncruise\neconomy and minimizing environmental impact in terms of\nnoise and emissions,\nand in general, reducing aircraft\nacquisition\nand operating\ncosts. In assessing\nfuture\npropulsion facility requirements, the focus was primarily on\ndevelopment\nfacilities for future subsonic and supersonic\ncommercial\ntransports.\nThe overall assessment\nwas that,\nwith a few exceptions,\nthe U.S. industry and government\nlaboratories\nhave the largest and most capable propulsion\nfacilities\nin the world. However, additional facilities may\nbe required to ensure effective\ndevelopment\nof future\npropulsion\nsystems in the areas of high mass flow for\nsubsonic transports, inclement weather simulation, and fullscale engine tests for the High Speed Civil Transport.\nUpgrades to the Aeropropulsion System Test Facility (ASTF)\nfor increased mass flow, supersonic free jet testing, engine/\nnozzle test capability, and increased capability in the Lewis\nIcing Research Tunnel may be required. These upgrades are\non the order of $20 million each, except for the increase in\nmass flow which could be as high as $500 million. Because\nof the high cost and undetermined\nneed, a two-year low\nlevel of effort study is recommended\nto define mass flow\nrequirements\nfor engines beyond the current generation\n(PW4OOO/GEgO)\nbefore\nthe mass flow\nupgrade\nis\nrecommended.\nHypersonic\n\nundertaken\nlater to provide the needed systems certlfwa.\ntion facilities once the enabling facility technologies\nare in\nhand.\nThe focused program of research is clearly the most\nurgent need in hypersonics ; it is required to select, develop,\nand demonstrate\nthe most promisingfacility\nconcepts.

The\ntypical new aircraft, fighter or transport, requires from\n20,000 to 25,000 test hours. A major derivative transport\nairplane such as the Boeing 737-300 or the McDonnell\nDouglas MD-11 requires 4,000 to 5,000 hours for development. From 1965 to present, the U.S. commercial aircraft\nindustry has utilized an average of 15,000 test hours per year\nand projects this utilization to continue well into the next\ncentury. Recognizing\na continuing demand for wind tunnel\ntesting and the existence of other budget-related consolidation and closure activities, including the ongoing NASA\ninfrastructure reduction and the DoD Project Reliance, the\nAeronautics Task Group took an aggressive look at potential facility closures. A total of 44 major government-owned\nwind tunnels and propulsion facilities were considered. The\nfacilities were grouped into four major categories: a) those\nconsidered to be unique and valuable national assets which\nwere not considered further for closure because of their\ncritical value and unquestioned need, b) those being worked\nas part of NASA infrastructure reduction, c) those to be\nworked for consolidation\nbetween agencies, and d) those\nimpacted when the proposed new wind tunnels are available.

Therefore, the two task groups\ndealing with space developed a consistent model of future\nspace mission programs, including both operations and\nR&D. The resulting model is a middle-ground baseline\nconstructed for NFS analytical purposes with excursions to\ncover potential space program strategies. (As agency and\nAdministration decisions impacting the mission model were\nmade, the model was updated to reflect those decisions.)\nThe model includes three major sectors: DoD, civilian\ngovernment(e.g.,\nNASA, National Oceanicand Atmospheric\nAdministration\n(NOAA), etc.), commercial\nand\nspace\n(e.g.,\nthetelecommunications\nsatellite\nindustry).\nThe\nmodelspans next30years\nthe\nbecause\nofthe\nlonglead\ntimes\nassociated with facilities development and usage.\nThe DoD members of the Space Operations and R&D\nTask Groups developed the military elements of the requirements model. NASA members of the task groups integrated\nthe civilian government portion. Commercial space requirements were provided by DOT\'s Office of Commercial\nSpace Transportation using inputs from the Commercial\nSpace Transportation Advisory Committee. For each sector, a baseline forecast of future missions, supporting programs (e.g., R&D), and launch requirements was developed\nand integrated for the period 1993-2023. The goal of the\nbaseline was to provide a common, conservative basis for\nfacilities requirements, analysis, and recommendations. In\naddition to this baseline, a set of \'excursions\' was also\ndefined to test the sensitivity of facility recommendations to\nthe mission model and to take into account future program\ndirections considered likely by the task group.\nBASELINE\n\n*\n\nTelecommunications. The model forecasts continuing operations of radio frequency geostationary\ntelecommunications satellite systems, with block\nupgrades to 2023; and after 1995-1998, initiation of\n1-2 low Earth orbit telecommunications constellations, with block upgrades through 2023.\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nEarth ObservingfRemote Sensing. The baseline\nincludes modest commercial Earth remote sensing\nsatellite operations following 2003.\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nMaterials Processing In Space. The forecast is for\nmodest commercial materials processing operations following 2003.\n\nCivilian Government. The baseline model for civilian\ngovernment space activities forecasts continuing operations\nof existing systems as well as several major new systems\ndevelopments after 2000-2005. In addition to ongoing\nmission-supporting manufacturing (e.g., in industry), launch\n(e.g., Kennedy Space Center), and operations (such as the\nDeep Space Network), baseline areas include the following:\n\nMODEL\n\nOverall, the baseline model forecasts continuing operations of many current existing systems with very selective new systems. (Figure 1 in Appendix C provides a\nsummary view of the baseline space launch mission requirements model including launch vehicle class and user for the\nperiod 1993-2023.) Selected, significant baseline model\nfeatures of the three basic sectors are as follows:\nCommercial. The baseline model for civilian commercial space activities includes continuing manufacture, launch,\nand operations of existing systems (with periodic block\nupgrades), augmented by selected major systems developments. Areas include the following:\nI,_\xc2\xa221g]LS_.tf2_. The model forecasts continuing\noperation of existing commercial expendable\nlaunch vehicle (ELV) fleets through 2023, and\n- 12-\n\nMission to Planet Earth/Earth Observing. The forecast calls for completion of the initial Earth Observing System series, development & operations\nof a second series through 2023 with small to\nmedium size platforms, and NOAA weather satellite systems (and upgrades).\nSpace Science/Mission From Planet Earth. The\nmodel includes completion of the Great Observatories, followed by small & moderate-class Earth\norbit science missions, and a strategic changeover\nto small to moderate-class, deep space probes after\nthe launch of the flagship-class Cassini Mission to\nSaturn.\nSpace Exploration and Development. The baseline\nincludes Space Shuttle operations (with upgrades)\nand the current expendable launch vehicles (with\nupgrades) through the 2023 timeframe; development and launch of international redesigned space\nstation with European, Japanese, Canadian, and\nRussian elements and U.S. launch with continuing\noperations through the 2023 timeframe; and phased\ntransition of the Deep Space Network (DSN) to\nKa-Band communications in 2003-2008.\n\n_?_,.Tr, g]IBP.I_.

(Figures\nI and 2 in Appendix C provide the forecast of utilization by\nsector for each range.)\nEXCURSIONS\nIn addition\nwas developed\n\nto the baseline\n\nmodel, a series of excursions\n\nfor both space\n\ntask groups.\n\nFor the Space Operations Task Group, a single excursion\nwas developed examining the impact of a future decision to\ndevelop a new Highly Reusable Vehicle (HRV) for access to\nspace (such as a Single-Stage-to-Orbit\n(SSTO) vehicle).\n-13-\n\nwere\n\nFor the Space R&D Task Group, three broad options\nconsidered,\nincluding\nthe development\nof several\n\nsignificant\nnew systems in the post-2000\ntimeframe\nin all\nthree sectors, paralleled by increasing support to U.S. industry by related (predominantly\nR&D programs. For example,\n\ncivilian) government\nspace\nin commercial space a new\n\ncargo-carrying\nvehicle was projected to meet growth in low\nEarth orbit (LEO) communications\nsystems, in commercial\nEarth observing\nand/or remote sensing, and in materials\nprocessing in space (beginning in the post-2003 timeframe).\nSimilarly, in the civilian government\nsector, the excursions\nforecast new systems for Mission\nto Planet Earth (e.g.,\ngeostationary\nplatforms following completion\nof the initial\nEOS), for space science (such as Next Generation\nSpace\nObservatories\nin post-2008),\nfor human exploration and\nspace development\n(such as replacement\nof the Shuttle by a\nHighly Reusable Vehicle and deep-space\nhuman exploration), as well as growth in space technology\nefforts in\nground-based\nR&D and technology\nflight experiments.\nFinally, for DoD, excursion projections included launch and\noperations of GPS II for improved navigation,\nnew multispectral surveillance\nsystems, a Next Generation\nLaunch\nSystem, potential deployment of missile/theater\ndefense systerns, and classified missions and programs appropriate for\nthe excursion.\n\nSPACE\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nThree functional facility areas were defined to assess\nspace operations facilities: Manufacturing; Mission Operations and Training; and Payload Processing, Launch, and\nRecovery. Data were collected on facilities including commercial and government-owned manufacturing facilities,\nNASA, Navy, NOAA, and Air Force space operations\nfacilities and a limited number of Army facilities. Although\nthe facility inventory was not completely developed during\nthis initial phase of the study, it is felt that the major facilities\ninvolved in space operations activities have been included.\n\nis most pronounced in command and control, training, tracking, and, in a more limited way, launch\nsupport facilities.\nFacilities are constructed and operated primarily in\nsupport of program requirements. There are no\ncoordinated processes at the agency level or between agencies, for providing continued institutional support of program facilities that may be\nneeded in the future when the sponsoring program\nhas been terminated or completed.\n\nSignificant findings and conclusions which emerged\nduring the evaluation are as follows:\n\nThe task group found evidence of facility deterioration and obsolescence which significantly constrains efficient and effective facility performance.\nThis conclusion has been previously noted by\nvarious studies within NASA and DoD. In general,\nNASA and DoD spend approximately two percent\nof current replacement value for facility maintenance compared to a recommended three-four percent. Facilities should be consolidated and closed\nwhere practical, and facility maintenance budgets\nshould be better focused to reverse the current\ntrend of deterioration and obsolescence of remaining facilities.\n\nThe baseline mission model projection for the next\n30 years can be met with existing facilities with\nonly small additions (e.g., Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory for Space Station). Improvements must be\nmade to strengthen and enhance efficiency of the\nfacility infrastructure, (e.g., Air Force Range Standardization and Automation Program).\nFacilities required to support implementation of\nnew launch vehicles such as a highly reusable\nlaunch system (e.g., single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO))\nare highly dependent on the specific configuration\nbeing considered and the degree with which program objectives are directed toward reducing launch\ncosts. The requirements of most of the concepts,\nhowever, can be met by modification of existing\nfacilities.\n\nAt operational locations where multiple agencies\nco-exist, the study team found many noteworthy\ninstances of agency-to-agency\ncooperation and\nsharing which can serve as a model for the future.\nFor example, an Air Force/NASA liaison team\noperates at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station\n(CCAFS) and Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to\ncoordinate range and launch scheduling, facilities\nusage and sharing, and other activities. NASA\nrepresentatives attend Air Force range scheduling\nand operations review meetings, and the KSC\nCenter Director and the Air Force\'s 45th Space\nWing Commander conduct a joint quarterly management meeting. There are many other examples.\nMany functions, such as medical support and propellant services, are administered by one agency\nbut include support to the other agency as appropilate. NASA and DoD should formally adopt this\napproach within our agencies as the preferred way\nof doing business.\n\nBudget reductions and program cancellations have\nproduced an underutilization of the capacity of\nmany space operation facilities. This has led to\nexcessive operations and maintenance costs and\ninefficient use of personnel. At the same time, a\nsignificant number of the government\'s key facilities suffer from underfunding for maintenance,\nrestoration, and modernization.\nSubstantial cost savings can best be realized when\nconsolidation of activities results in reduced personnel requirements through increased efficiency\nand elimination of duplicative effort. Closure and\nconsolidation of facilities, thus avoiding annual\noperations and maintenance costs, provide only a\nmodest savings.\nRedefined/realigned functions and responsibilities within and between the agencies, which decrease overlap and clarify respective responsibilities would allow more significant reductions/consolidation in facilities, people, and programs.

Non.traditional\napproaches should be considered for obtaining this critt.\ncally needed capability. Legislation patterned after the\n"Unitary Plan," which was enacted previously for commercially oriented wind tunnel acquisition, is one option. Tax\nincentives are another. Since the new capability is targeted\nso strongly toward industry needs, industry could have a\nmuch greater involvement in the venture.\nGeographical location of the new wind tunnels merits\ncareful consideration because they are expected to be in\nservice for decades. A "level playing field" should be\nestablished to evaluate various locations on their technical\nmerits with strong weighting of factors which help keep\noperating costs low.\nSPACE\nSeventy recommended options for improved effectiveness should be considered for implementation. They can be\naccomplished without significant roles and mission changes.\nThe responsible organizations should review the NFS\nconsolidation/closure findings in Volumes 4 and 5 and\ndevelop implementation plans for each option. Representatives from the NFS Task Groups will assist in the process\nas desired.\nThe government and aerospace industry can take\nadditional steps to streamline and focus the Nation\'s space\nfacilities in this austere budget environment.\nNational facility planning is clearly affected by national objectives which arebeing reshaped in recognition of\nthe changing needs in defense and in the civil and commercial sectors. The need exists for a national vision and\nunderlyingpolicyforspace.\nIt was observed that during this\nperiod of dramatic downsizing of all participating departments and agencies, the roles and missions of the agencies\nas currently established has, in some cases, produced an\noverlap of functions and responsibilities. This was a limiting factor in defining some facility improvements or savings/de-commissioning. Nonetheless, the review concentrated on the best technical approaches and opportunities\nwhich might guide future strategic planning. The agency\nheads may want tojointly review overlapping functions and\nresponsibilities to determine if and where greater efficiencies/cost reduction could result without impacting negatively on the agency missions.\n\nThe NASA/DoD/Commercial\nMission and Requirements Model document should have long-term value for\norganizations developing strategic plans involving facilities and their usage. The mission model should be updated\nannually and made available to organizations involved in\nthe planning process.\nGENERAL\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFacility pricingpresents\n\nbarriers\n\nAlthough charging policy variations did not have a first\norder effect on facility recommendations, facility charging\npolicies merit a more systematic look than was possible in\nthe current study. For example, charging policies for launch\nservices need review because they influence private\nindustry\'s decisions on use of government facilities. Facility pricing and practices of DoD, DOC, DOE and NASA\nshould be the subject of an in.depth review with the\nobjective of developing uniform policy that encourages\nthe most cost-effective commerclal and interagency shared\nuse of U.S. Government facU_\'es.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNFS Inventory\n\nshould\n\nbe utilized\n\nAn up-to-date facilities database is needed when program and budget decisions ate made.

The database\nshould be institutionalized in a proper form and maintained by the affected agencies on a permanent basis for\nfuture reference by both government and, where appropriate, industry.

Preeminent among these are advances in aerospace technology. These advances are\npaced by modern highly productive research, development, and operational facilities. Recognizing this situation, on\nNovember 13, 1992, the NASA Administrator initiated the development of a comprehensive and integrated long-term plan\nfor future aerospace facilities. This integrated plan would be accomplished in partnership with other Government agencies,\nindustry, and academia to ensure that the facilities are world-class and to avoid duplication of effort. He contacted top\nofficials in the Departments of Defense, Energy, Transportation, Commerce, and the National Science Foundation inviting\nthem to participate in the development of the plan and the appropriate working groups. The Administrator proposed an\nOversight Group chaired by John R. Dailey, NASA Associate Deputy Administrator, with representation from DoD, DoT,\nDoE, DoC, and the NSF. Each of the agencies responded with nominations of individuals to serve on the Oversight Group\nand provide support on Task Groups to establish detailed plans. This Terms of Reference document provides the\ncoordinated charter for development of the Aerospace Facilities Plan.\nH.\n\nPURPOSE\n\nTo formulate a coordinated National Plan for world-class aeronautical and space facilities that meets the current and\nprojected needs for commercial and Government research and development, and for Government and commercial space\noperations.\nHI.\n\nSCOPE\n\nThe plan will include a catalogue of existing Government and industry facilities that support aeronautics and\nastronautics research, development, testing, and operations. International facilities will also be catalogued to determine\ncapability relative to U.S. facilities and applicability to address U.S. facility shortfalls.\nThe plan will include a requirements analysis which will consider current and future Government and commercial\nindustry needs as well as DoD and NASA mission requirements, through the year 2023, and specifically will address\nshortfalls in existing capabilities, new facility requirements, upgrades, consolidation, and phase out of existing facilities.\nAll new facility requirements and upgrades will be prioritized and detailed schedules and total funding will be specified.\nJoint management schemes, life cycle costs, and siting requirements will be fully evaluated.\nJoint funding between agencies and Government/industry will be considered.\ndeveloped where nonexistent.\n\nShared usage policies will be\n\nCosting, definitions, evaluation methodology and dollar threshold for facility inclusion in review will be approved\nby the Oversight Group.\nW.\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nAn Oversight Group, chaired by NASA with a DoD Vice-Chairman and including membership from DOE, DoT, DoC\nand the National Science Foundation, will have responsibility for implementing this TOR and plan development. The\nsecretary will be nominated by NASA.\nThe chairman will appoint a study director for executing this TOR. This person will be responsible for conducting\nthe study and its schedule, coordinating participation, integrating all inputs, preparing the final products, and providing\nthose products to the Oversight Group.\n\n- 24 -\n\nTo assist the study director, four task groups\n\nwill be established.\n\nThese are the Aeronautics\n\nR&D Task Group, the\n\nSpace R&D Task Group, the Space Operations Task Group and the Facilities Costing and Engineering\nGroup. The task\ngroups will be cochaired by NASA and DoD. All participating\nagencies will provide representatives\nto each task group.\nThe task groups will have the authority to establish working groups to assist them in their tasks. Membership\non the task\nand working groups will be limited to Government\nemployees and participation\nis optional, except for NASA and DoD.\nThe Aeronautics\nTask Group is an exception because of the special need to address commercial\ntransport aircraft. For this\nreason experts from private industry participate\nas Special Government\nEmployees,\nand the task group will function in\naccordance\nwith the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Throughout\nthe study, however, industry and academic inputs and\nadvice\n\nshould\n\nbe actively\n\nsolicited.\n\nThe Oversight Group will provide guidance to the task groups, serve as the coordination mechanism, perform periodic\nprogress reviews, resolve disputes or misunderstandings\nthat may arise between the agencies under the memorandum,\nand\nrecommend\nan integrated plan for agency approval.\nThe task groups will have responsibility\nfor planning, directing, and\nproviding\n\nrecommendations\n\nin their particular\n\ndiscipline\n\narea.\n\nEach agency will utilize its own reporting and tasking authority and will bear its and its employees\'\nparticipation.\nActivities shall be subject to the availability\nof funds and personnel of each party.\nV.\n\nown costs for\n\nPRODUCT\nThe study director will provide a summary\n\nreport to the Oversight\n\nGroup incorporating\n\ninput from each of the task\n\ngroups that includes a compendium\nof current facilities and capabilities; identification\nof shortfalls as a function of current\nand projected needs; and recommendations\nand rationale for new facilities, upgrades, consolidation,\nor closure of existing\nfacilities. Recommendations\nwill include cost impacts, either as investment costs or savings, and any other considerations\nthat would bear on the decision (i.e., national security concerns, technology transfer, proprietary\ndata rights, commercial\ncompetitiveness,\netc.).\nshared usage, common\n\nThe summary report will also include any recommendations\ncosting, and management\nand operation.\n\nrelative\n\nto a policy\n\nnature,\n\nsuch as\n\nUpon approval by the Oversight Group, each report will be forwarded for agency approval.\nFinal reports will be\napproved at the Deputy Administrator/Under\nSecretary level or equivalent. For the DoD, the responsible\nauthority is the\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition.\nFinal reports should reflect a national viewpoint endorsed by NASA, DoD,\nDoC, DoT, DoE and NSF.\nVl.\n\nSCHEDULE\nInterim\n\nTask Group Reports (to support FY \'95 budget\n\nJuly 1993\n\ndecisions)\n\nFinal Task Group Reports\n\nJanuary 1994\n\nOversight\n\nFebruary\n\nApproval\n\nCoordination\nApproval\n\n- Task Group Reports\n\nof Individual\n\nof Individual\n\nVII.
