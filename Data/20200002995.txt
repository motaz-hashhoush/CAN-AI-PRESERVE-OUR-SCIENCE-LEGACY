b'SPRINT: Scheduling Planning Routing Intersatellite\nNetwork Tool\nScheduling CubeSat Constellations for Earth Observation\nThe Scheduling Planning Routing Intersatellite Network Tool (SPRINT) software system\nplans and schedules the operations (observations, inter-satellite crosslink communications, and ground communications) of Earth\nobservation (EO) constellations of hundreds\nof resource-constrained small satellites to\nenable global, near real-time science. Historically, most CubeSats have flown radios\nonly for direct-to-ground downlink of data;\nas a result, data availability is delayed by as\nlong as it takes for the capturing satellite to\npass over a ground station, typically hours.\nCurrent Planning and Scheduling (P&S) systems for constellations cannot handle data\nrouting through a large, dynamic network\ntopology, and all planning is handled on\nthe ground without the ability to autonomously prioritize important observations,\nor respond to unexpected changes in communication window or bandwidth. SPRINT\ndirectly handles both data routing for low\nlatency bulk observation data downlink and\nreplanning onboard to deal with dynamic\npriorities and fault response, maximizing the\nutility of downlinked data.\nThe system will bridge current gaps in the\nstate of the art by developing a P&S system\nthat includes both a centralized, groundbased element (\xe2\x80\x9cGlobal Planner\xe2\x80\x9d) that plans\nobservation timing and the use of crosslinks\nand downlinks to route data to ground, and\nan onboard element (\xe2\x80\x9cLocal Planner\xe2\x80\x9d) that\ncan reassess and replan data collection\nand routing based on changing observation priorities and up-to-date satellite state\ninformation. The system will include a protocol that manages the propagation of information about plan changes through the\nconstellation over intermittent communications links, and allows individual satellites to\nreconcile these changes before activity execution. A set of metrics will be used to assess how communications delays affect this\nreconciliation process, particularly in cases\nof node outages and surge usage. Metrics\n\nAn Earth observation constellation with crosslinks\nwill include average latency of data downlinked,\nwhich assesses the time it takes for captured\nobservation data to arrive at a ground station;\naverage age of information (AoI) (observation\ndata), which measures the average age of latest available data on the ground; and time for\nreplanning on the ground and distribution of\nupdated plans to the full constellation.\n\nMetric\nLatency\nAoL\nTime for plan\n\nThreshold\n\xe2\x89\xa4 1 hour\n\xe2\x89\xa4 1 hour\n\xe2\x89\xa4 1.5 hour\n\nGoal\n\xe2\x89\xa4 \xc2\xbc hour\n\xe2\x89\xa4 \xc2\xbd hour\n\xe2\x89\xa4 1 hour\n\nPlanning and scheduling metrics\nThe SPRINT work has significant relevance\nfor NASA and the wider space community.\nSPRINT\xe2\x80\x99s reference mission is a CubeSat constellation of high data rate hyperspectral imagers for frequent, quick-update monitoring a\nset of ground targets. The high data rate imagers (> 100 Mbps) demonstrate the utility of the\nSPRINT networking and scheduling approach\nfor other data-intensive EO scenarios. The\nP&S system uses a small satellite operational\nmodel that is applicable for most EO constellation scenarios, after a relatively small amount\n\nof mission-specific adaptation. It is well-suited for managing the delay-tolerant, store-and-forward networking\nstrategy employed in small satellite systems due to limited onboard resources. The separation of the system\ninto both a centralized, ground-based element and distributed, onboard elements allows it to scale to constellations of hundreds of small satellites and enables rapid\nonboard response to changing observation and data\nrouting priorities as well as fault conditions.\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Space\nTelecommunications Astronomy and Radiation (STAR)\nLaboratory will develop the algorithms, framework, implementation and analysis for the SPRINT project, leveraging the perspectives and experience of the lab in\nsmall satellite payload and radio frequency and optical\ncommunication system development. The partnering\nNASA Ames Research Center will provide expertise in\nP&S and autonomy algorithms and testing. Partners at\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center will provide guidance in modeling the hyperspectral imaging payload,\nscience planning and scheduling, and modeling communications links.\n\nFor more information about the SSTP, visit:\nwww.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/small_spacecraft\nFor more information on SPRINT, please contact:\nProf. Kerri Cahoy\nSPRINT Project Manager\nDepartment of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nkcahoy@mit.edu\nRoger C.
