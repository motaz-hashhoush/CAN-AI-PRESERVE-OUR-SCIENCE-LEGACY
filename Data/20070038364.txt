Much\nlike the change in the computer industry brought about by the introduction of\nthe personal computer or the change in the phone industry brought about by\nthe advent of the cellular phone, many experts in the aviation industry feel\nthat the very light jet (VLJ), known by some as the microjet (Seidenman,\n2004), will also have a ground-breaking effect on the air travel equation.\nThese aircraft will have five to six passenger seats, weigh less than 10,000\npounds, and be able to operate safely from airports with runways as short as\n3,000 feet. Initial data indicates that these aircraft will offer jet utility and\nperformance and will be able to operate at lower costs relative to traditional\njets (Asker, 2005). Industry insiders predict that VLJs will bring about\ndramatic changes for air travelers, aircraft operators, and providers of aircraft\nsupport services.\nThe president of the National Business Aircraft\nAssociation (NBAA) predicts a new era of business travel will begin with\nthe introduction of the VLJ (Morrison, 2005).\nOn July 27, 2006, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted\nprovisional certification to Eclipse Aviation and its Eclipse 500 (FAA,\n2006), the first of fourteen manufacturers seeking certification of twin- and\nsingle-jet designs, ranging from the traditional Cessna Aircraft Company to\nthe nontraditional Honda Motor Company (Haines, 2005; Lunsford, 2004;\nVLJ Magazine, 2007). In support of the aircraft, the NBAA, based on its\nknowledge of the users and manufacturers of these aircraft, has developed\nand released pilot training guidelines that many predict will become a\nbaseline for VLJ insurance coverage, a service necessary for aircraft\nfinancing (NBAA, 2005; Trautvetter, 2005b). In a related article, Asker\n(2005) reviewed recent VLJ sales data and noted that aviation industry\nanalysts have predicted hundreds of cities could be transformed by low-cost\nair taxi service through the introduction of VLJs. Ells (2005) noted that\ntravelers are becoming more aware of the utility and economy of airport-toairport direct travel and affordable VLJs will provide a big boost to this\nmarket. Support for these predictions can be found in a recent report of a\nTeal Group study. This study concluded that business jet service is expected\nto grow because unlike air carriers operating from larger airports, business\njets can serve smaller cities and offer less hijack threat and less security\nhassle (Solon, 2005).\nStudies conducted by organizations or by manufacturers are routinely\nreferenced, and positive forecasts for future growth in the VLJ market are\ncommonly cited in today\xe2\x80\x99s literature (Seidenman, 2004; Trautvetter, 2005a).\nThe depth and completeness of these studies are not publicly available,\n\nCobb, Thomas & Cobb\n\n89\n\nhowever, and no common VLJ market information exists for all\nstakeholders. For example, the question of sales demand for VLJ aircraft is\na basic inquiry for manufacturers entering this market. When looking at\npublished research, Trautvetter (2005a) found wide-ranging estimates of\nVLJ demand with Rolls-Royce predicting 8,000 deliveries by 2023, Inflight\nManagement Development Centre forecasting sales of 847 aircraft by 2013,\nand the FAA forecasting demand for 4,500 aircraft by 2016. Market data\nfrom manufacturers is equally confusing with a sales forecast of from 5,000\nto 10,000 VLJs by 2014 (Seidenman, 2004).\nINSURANCE, TRAINING, AND REGULATORY ISSUES\nPredicting the availability of services in support of VLJ operation is\nimportant. Olcott (2004) reviewed the emerging VLJ market and discussed\nhow best to train pilots, gain acceptance by the professional flying\ncommunity and the FAA, and overcome the problem of insurability of\nowner-pilots. In reviewing some of these same concerns, Trautvetter\n(2005a) suggested that because of FAA scrutiny and NBAA training\nguidelines, insurance costs for VLJ aircraft could be less than turboprop\nsingle-engine aircraft. The NBAA Training Guidelines for Single Pilot\nOperation of Very Light Jets and Technically Advanced Aircraft was\ncompleted in January 2005 and included guidelines for initial candidate\nevaluation, pre-training study, manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s training, post rating training,\ninitial operating experience, and annual recurrent training. The guidelines\ncover four levels of training and suggest level of training should be based on\nexperience. For example, a pilot transitioning from the left seat of a jet\naircraft is classified in category 1 and would receive 25 hours of operating\nexperience while a less experienced single-engine pilot would be classified\nin category 4 and would receive 100 hours of operating experience.\nIntermediate level single- and twin-engine turboprop cabin-class experience\nwould require 35 hours for category 2 training and 50 hours for category 3\ntraining. Cessna Aircraft Company and Adam Aircraft Company have\npredicted anywhere from 14,000 to 20,000 twin-engine and turboprop\naircraft owners as potential customers to move up to a VLJ (Trautvetter,\n2005b). Similar guidelines for dual or mentor instruction are evident for the\nleading manufacturers (Eclipse, 2007; Sierra, 2007).\nIn a presentation at the Latin American Business Aviation Event, Stine\n(2005) noted many common misconceptions about the availability of\ninsurance for owner-flown VLJs. In his summary, he stated that VLJ\ncertification will follow predictable past models, most insurance\nunderwriters are studying coverage guidelines, and some companies have\nalready announced VLJ coverage based on proficiency and specific training\nrequirements. In a more recent review of the state of the aircraft insurance\n\n90\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\nindustry, Chappell (2006) concluded that VLJs would be insurable and\npremiums would be based on aircraft quality; pilot skill and experience; and\ntransition training programs. He also concluded that the jet single-pilot\noperation would be insured at higher liability limits accompanied by higher\npremiums.\nGovernment support for these aircraft is also critical to success. In his\nreview of government support initiatives, Stine (2005) found several positive\nexamples. He noted that the FAA had provided additional resources for VLJ\naircraft certification and revisions were being considered to key Federal\nAviation Regulations to allow Part 23 certification for single-pilot Part 135\noperations. He also found the FAA was supporting the development of FAA\nIndustry Training Standard for Technically Advanced Aircraft.\nHe\nconcluded that once certified and in service, VLJs are more likely to use\nsmaller general aviation airports and thus would not add to congestion at\nlarger airports. This logic should be supported by most air-taxi operators\nseeking efficiency, profitability, and point-to-point customer travel needs.\nReviewing the good and bad aspects of VLJ operations, Webster (2006)\noffered his expert commentary to the International Risk Management\nInstitute. In his review he considered the range of pilot skills, aircraft use,\nand owner-pilot background. He concluded faster aircraft could be safer\naircraft if pilots are properly trained and the new aircraft type is given\nrespect.\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nThis study was undertaken to provide the data needed to answer some of\nthese questions about the VLJ market. The data was gathered by means of a\nself-administered questionnaire delivered electronically via the Internet. The\nmailing list for the study was an opt-in list of magazine subscribers to\nBusiness & Commercial Aviation. The questionnaire consisted of a section\ndesigned to measure the use of air service by respondents\xe2\x80\x99 organizations, a\nsection designed to assess perceptions and expected use of VLJ aircraft, and\na demographic section to measure business characteristics.\nPRELIMINARY RESULTS\nWhile the response rate for the study is disappointing (160 respondents\nor 3.18%), the sample achieved does appear to be representative of the target\npopulation. The validity of the sample may be indicated by two factors.\nFirst, those organizations that operate their own passenger aircraft stressed\nthe importance of the availability of resources for such travel to a statically\ngreater extent than organizations that do not operate their own aircraft.\nSecond, and even more revealing regarding the nature of the sample, those\nthat operate their own aircraft were statistically more likely to use VLJs for\n\n91\n\nCobb, Thomas & Cobb\n\ntrips under 500 miles than organizations that do not operate their own\naircraft. In other words, the sample appears to consist primarily of\norganizations that comprise the target market for VLJs.\nFurthermore, in summarizing significant positive responses (Table 1),\nwe observed that the majority of the organizations represented in the sample,\n59.4%, use air services often (multiple flights per week) or extensively\n(multiple flights per day) and the vast majority of firms operate their own\npassenger aircraft (72.5%). Additionally, 78.8% of the respondents occupy\nmiddle managers or higher positions in their firms. Even more importantly,\n73.8% identify themselves as either a strong influencer or the main decision\nmaker for the buying center of the organization. Not surprisingly, most\ncompany trips are comprised of management personnel, 40.6%, or a mixture\nof different personnel, 53.8% (Table 2). Finally, the majority of respondents\nappear to work for large businesses in that 60.1% reported annual\norganizational revenues of more than $6,000,000 and employment of an\naverage of 4,536 organizational employees (Tables 3 and 4).\nTable 1.

Understanding that VLJs can accommodate up to six\npassengers, respondents were asked how many organizational personnel\ntypically board the same flight. Of the sample, 88.1% reported that normally\nsix or fewer of their personnel fly on the same flight (Table 1). With a\nnormal seating capacity of six to seven (Seidenman, 2004) and with\nmanufacturers targeting air-taxi operators and owner-pilots, VLJs appear to\nbe well suited to address these organizations\xe2\x80\x99 air service needs.\nTable 4.

They also indicated they\nwould expect to fly these aircraft an average of 343 flight hours/year and\noperate an average of 109 flights per year (Table 3). The respondents also\nwere asked how likely their use of air services would increase once VLJs are\nintroduced. Of the sample, 53.8% indicated either \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps would increase\xe2\x80\x9d\nor \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely would increase,\xe2\x80\x9d and 8.7% of the sample was unsure (Table\n5). Thus, the potential market for VLJs seems quite strong, as a large\npercentage of air service clients may be likely to switch to them once they\nare introduced.\nLooking at the classifications of the respondents\xe2\x80\x99\norganizations (Table 6), we observe that services represent the largest\nrespondent group, 37.5%, followed by manufacturing, 24.4%, with\n\n93\n\nCobb, Thomas & Cobb\n\ntransportation being the largest single respondent group, 20%. Most\norganizations had less than 10 different personnel using air services, or\n45.7%; however, 23.1% said that over 100 different personnel used air\nservices annually (Table 7).\nTable 5.

Of interest we found that\nVLJ use was considered important for short trips up to 500 miles and longer\ntrips over 500 miles. Operation with a single pilot was not considered to be\n\n94\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\na handicap by prospective VLJ users. Most believe that VLJ use would open\nup new markets but were very concerned about the availability of ground\ntransportation, fuel, and food services at smaller airports (Table 8).\nTable 8.

Regression analysis\n(see Table 9) revealed that two factors significantly influence increased use.\nSpecifically, the fact that VLJs allow access to previously inaccessible\nmarkets, as well as the importance of the availability of food service at small\nairports, increased the likelihood of increased air service usage. This finding\nis encouraging in that regarding the marketability of these aircraft, potential\ncustomers of VLJs already recognize the prime benefit that VLJs offer their\nbusinesses: reaching more of their own customers more easily.\nTable 9.

Today, fifteen manufacturers are posed to capture part of this new\nmarket. Stone (2003) refers to them as a \xe2\x80\x9cnew generation of aviation\nentrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 60). VLJ supporters seem to view the use of these aircraft\nas an economical way to save time by avoiding the congestion associated\n\nCobb, Thomas & Cobb\n\n95\n\nwith large airports; they believe this convenience will open up new customer\nmarkets. According to Stine (2005), the argument of some that thousands of\nVLJs will create their own type of airspace congestion will probably not\noccur. By design, VLJs can operate from most of the 5000 public use\nairports in the U.S. while the airlines currently use only 429 (Industry Facts,\n2004). Also, of those used by the airlines, only 30 airports are centers for\nterminal area class B airspace control, and only a minority of this group\nexperiences most of the recorded flight delays annually (Avoiddelays.com,\n2007). VLJs by design and due to projected point-to-point use will avoid\nmost of these airports and the approach and departure corridor congestion\nand delay associated with these airports.\nThe respondents of this survey seem to represent a good sample of the\nmarket for VLJ ownership and air-taxi use. The majority said they are likely\nto use VLJs when available. A majority seemed to prefer jets and already\noperate their own aircraft. The fact that almost 90% of the respondents\xe2\x80\x99\nbusiness trips involve six or fewer people makes the VLJ a strong candidate\nfor these organizations. Not all of the initial manufacturers will survive the\nmarket shakeout, and concerns over support services at smaller airports will\nhave to be addressed if the jets are to reach their full potential.\nFUTURE RESEARCH\nThis study focused on describing the prospective operators of VLJ\naircraft. Future market research should focus on those stakeholders\nimpacted by the use of this new aircraft type. Specifically, future research\nshould examine the impact of VLJs on airports, maintenance operations, and\nfood service operations, to name a few. In other words, stakeholders need an\nunderstanding of how air support services should adapt to meet the needs of\nVLJ users. Such an examination will provide VLJ manufacturers with a\nclearer understanding of the true market and impact of these aircraft.\nAdditional research should focus upon those factors that will drive\ndemand for VLJs. For instance, a better understanding of the needs of air\nservice customers is required, in addition to the psychographic factors (such\nas trust in the product and/or manufacturer) that may influence customers\xe2\x80\x99\ndemand for these aircraft. With this understanding, VLJ manufacturers will\nbe better positioned to properly market this new product, and air support\nproviders will gain an increased ability to fulfill adequately the new\nrequirements generated by the introduction of these new jets.\n\n96\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\nREFERENCES\nAsker, J.
