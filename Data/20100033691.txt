That\'s\nwhy it\'s critical to analyse for natural frequencies and use\nthem in vibration loading situations. In random vibration analysis, a typical load-time curve, perhaps\nlasting for hours, is boiled down to its frequency components.\nStandard loadings are usually available for these kinds of vibrations, because each has a\ncharacteristic "Signature." For transportation-related applications of random vibration analysis, it is\ncustomary to develop vibration loading in a Power Spectral Density (PSD) for subsequent engineering\nanalysis. A PSD is a curve of ~/hertz versus frequency ("g" is gravitational constant). Random\nvibration analysis is the process by which these frequency-dependent loads are applied to your model\nto give you stresses and deflections.\n\nHere\'s how Algor makes it easier:\nAlgor software includes an interactive program which makes\nit easier to define vibration loadings in PSDs. Algor also\nSimplifies the process of obtaining stress and vibration\nresults. Begin by using Algor software to perform a natural\nfrequency (modal) analysis. Then, the software automatically\nuses those results to compute the loads and analyse for\nstresses and deflections.\n\nWhen the Engineering\nHas t o be Right\xe2\x84\xa2\nFor UNIX Workstations\nand Pentiums\n\nHere\'s when:\n\nAlgo r Europe , Ltd .\n\nAnalysis of the same beam,\nwith vibration loads applied\nstatically, shows an entirely\ndifferent stress pattern.\n\nNorthumberland House, Drake Avenue\nStaines, Middlesex TW18 2AP UK\n\nThis clearly demonstrates\nthat for transportation-related\ncomponents, static analysis\nisn\'t good enough. You may\nneed to do random vibration\nanalysis to be responsible.\n\nUSA Headquarters Phone: +1 (412) 967-2700\nUSA Headquarters Fax: +1 (412) 967-2781\nTokyo: +81 03-3589-6148\n\nPhone: +44 (0784) 442 246\nFax: +44 (0784) 449358\n\nFor a free i nformati on package\non Algor\' s complet e line o f stress\nand v ibration a n alysis software,\nc a ll or fax today.\n\nCONVERT\nCOMPUTER\nGRAPIDCS\nTO VIDEO\nR E COR D IN G,\n\nT RAN S MIS S I ON,\n\nP ROJEC T ION\n\nAND\n\nTELECONFERENCING\n\nNI\\SI\\Tech Briefs\nOfficial Publication of the\nNational Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration\n\nNASA Tech Briefs\nPublished by .........................................................Associated Business Publications\nPresident/Chief Executive Officer ...........................................................

Following additional testing and evaluation, the auto\nmaker plans to introduce the Patriot\nMark II, an open-cockpit vehicle that can\nreach a top speed in excess of 200 mph\nvia a hybrid power system that includes\nboth a heat engine and an electric drive.\nWhile Chrysler expects its hybrid-powered car to succeed on the track, the\nPatriot is first and foremost a research\nproject, according to Francois Castaing,\nChrysler\'s vice president of vehicle engineering. Even if the car fails, Castaing\nbelieves the Patriot racing experience will\nbe a win/win situation since it will provide\ndata for the Chrysler team to use in its\nattempt to meet the goals set by the\nClinton Administration as part of the\nPartnership for a New Generation Vehicle\n(Super Car) program. The program participants, including Chrysler, General Motors,\nand Ford, are dedicated to building lowemission, fuel-efficient passenger cars,\nwhich may include a hybrid-powered vehicle. A hybrid car would have the benefits\n\nT\n\nof environmental cleanliness and energy\nefficiency associated with electric cars,\nbut would provide the power and range of\nconventional internal combustion cars.\nChrysler introduced the Patriot Mark I\nprototype in January 1994 at the North\nAmerican International Auto Show as a\n"laboratory on wheels." After extensive\nevaluation, it was determined that the\ncar\'s weight distribution and aerodynamics would not be competitive at high\nspeeds. Chrysler engineers and designers, together with engineers at Reynardthe English developers of the car\'s body\nand chassis-altered the vehicle layout\nfrom a rear-engine to a mid-engine\ndesign, and created the second generation vehicle, the Patriot Mark II.\nWhile standard electric cars typically\nare equipped with large lead-acid batteries that lose heat energy when they\nbrake, hybrid-powered cars generate\ntheir own electricity without the need for\na battery. Standard electric cars usually\ncannot travel more than 100 miles without recharging and have inadequate\nacceleration capability. The goal of\nhybrid cars is to run the internal combustion engine at a near-constant speed,\n\nallowing it to burn more efficiently.\nThe Patriot\'s unique design replaces\nthe standard lead-acid battery with a carbon-composite, 125-pound flywheel\nenergy storage (FES) system designed\nby SatCon Technology, a Cambridge,\nMA-based manufacturer of electromechanical products. The flywheel converts latent electric energy to rotational\nenergy and stores it by spinning at up to\n58,000 rpm in a near-perfect vacuum on\nalmost frictionless bearings. The flywheel\'s carbon fiber has a tensile\nstrength of 900,000 pounds per square\ninch, and acts as a buffer that allows the\nturbine to operate at a constant speed.\nIts latent energy is converted back to\nelectricity and used when needed for\nmaximum acceleration out of corners\nand down straightaways. When the car is\nnot running at top speeds, the flywheel\nspins faster, storing the excess generated energy. In a hybrid-powered passenger car, the recaptured braking energy\npotentially could produce a 10 to 15 percent increase in fuel mileage.\nSince the flywheel is responsible for the\ncar\'s propulsion, the stress on the engine\nis reduced. Chrysler believes this technol-\n\nogy could produce smaller, more efficient\nengines in hybrid electric passenger cars,\nwithout sacrificing performance. The flywheel technology could replace batteries\nand serve as an energy storage system\nwith no performance deterioration, even\nafter thousands of recharges.\nMass-market electric vehicles historically have not been successful because\nthey have lacked a battery that can generate the mileage equivalent of a tank of\ngasoline before requiring a recharge. A\nhybrid powertrain using flywheel technology could be a viable solution, provided\nthe high costs involved can be reduced\nwith sufficient production volume.\nAs a participant in NASA\'s Small\nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR)\nprogram, SatCon began working with\nNASA in 19S6 to research and develop\nInformation\nflywheel\ntechnology.\ngleaned from 30 separate projects at\nNASA\'s Langley Research Center,\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Goddard\nSpace Flight Center, Johnson Space\nCenter, Lewis Research Center, and\nAmes Research Center from 19S6 to\n1994 combined to provide the technology behind the flywheel design. "We\ncan\'t point to one specific project that\nwas the basis for the car\'s flywheel:\nsaid Michael Turmelle, SatCon\'s vice\npresident and CFO. "They [the projects]\nwere all building blocks that led to the\nfinal design." NASA/SatCon programs\ndealing with micro-gyros, magnetic\nspindle bearings, induction motor flywheels, momentum wheels, EMA flywheels, and other related subjects all\ncontributed to the technology base necessary to design and manufacture the\nPatriot\'s powertrain components.\nIn 1991, NASA started a more focused\nstudy of the flywheel as a potential battery power replacement for aerospace\nand commercial industries, beyond its\nautomotive applications. SatCon supplies NASA with an Integrated Power and\nAttitude Control System (IPACS) that\ncombines energy storage and spacecraft\ncontrol functions in a single flywheel\nenergy system.\nSatCon also provides the Patriot\'s\ndrivetrain components: a turbo-altemator,\ntraction motor, and an electronic power\nconversion unit. The Turbo A1temator Unit\n(TAU) integrates a gas turbine and a highNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\n(Above) The Patriot Jjlywheel mngy swrage (FES) sys,,", consists 0/a high-sp..d jlywhee4 a mowr/generator, a bean\'ng support\nsystem. and a containment/vacuum housing.

The TAU burns compressed\nnatural gas to spin twin turbo alternators\nthat run at different speeds-one at\n60,000 rpm and one at close to 100,000\nrpm. The turbo altemators, similar to those\nused to provide power to jet airplanes\nparked at the terminal, produce electricity\nequivalent to 500 horsepower in a volume\nslightly larger than a shoebox. The generated electric power not used by the drive\nmotor to power the car is stored in the flywheel. The electric drive motor draws\npower from both the alternators and the\nflywheel to reach a top speed of more than\n200 mph. The car\'s electrical system controls about SOD volts, and the capacity of\nthe Patriot\'s power controller approaches\nlevels of wattage typically found in a 300home neighborhood substation.\nCryogenics Experts Inc. (CEXI) of Los\nAngeles which, previously worked with\nNASA to design space shuttle ground\nsupport fueling systems, is providing the\nPatriot\'s fuel pump, fuel tank, and vaporizer. Liquid natural gas (LNG) will be kept\non the race course in a cold storage tank\nat -159\xc2\xb0C. The LNG is then pumped into\nthe car\'s 123.3-liter-capacity fuel tank at\napproximately the same speed as regular\ngasoline. An on-board fuel pump pressurizes the LNG, which is then vaporized\nand fed into the turbine.\nChrysler currently is working with the\nSpace\nFlight\nCenter\'s\nMarshall\nTechnology Transfer Office to identify\n\npossible space shuttle-based insulation\nmaterials which could be integrated into\nthe Patriot\'s fuel system. One candidate\nis the Sprayed-On Foam Insulation\n(SOFI) material used on the shuttle\'s\nexternal tank. Samples and data of various high-temperature insulation materials currently used in the shuttle program\nhave been provided to Chrysler for\nreview. The MSFC Materials and\nProcesses Laboratory potentially will\napply these materials to Chrysler\'s engineering prototypes, if Chrysler determines these materials provide a good\nsolution to their immediate needs.\nChrysler\'s first application of natural\ngas as a clean-air fuel was in 1992, when\nits natural-gas-fueled, full-size van was\ncertified by the California Air Resources\nBoard as a low-emission vehicle (LEV). In\nFebruary 1994, Chrysler\'s CNG minivan\nwas certified as the first ultra-Iowemission vehicle (ULEV).\nThe state of California has mandated\nthat by the 199S model year, two percent of all vehicles sold in the state must\nbe zero-emission vehicles. Hybrid-powered cars such as the Patriot, because\nthey are not zero-emission vehicles,\ncannot meet the new laws. But that\nhasn\'t put the brakes on the company\'s\nresearch into cleaner, more fuel-efficient\nvehicles. Through the Patriot project,\nChrysler hopes to show that these cars\nalso can be powerful, good-looking,\nand fun to drive.\n\n13\n\nResource Report\n\nJohnson\nSpace Center\nThe Johnson Space Flight Center covers\n1,620 acres offormer cattle ranchland on the Texas coast.\n\nwon NASA\'s Invention of the Year Award\nperiodic reporting.

Less parts, less assembly\nsteps, less assembly time- all yield\nmore productivity and more cost\nreductions. To achieve this, designing\nfor assembly (DFA) is critical.\nPEM \xc2\xae products address this requirement. Just punch or drill a hole and\npress a PEM fastener into place. PEM\nself-clinching fasteners install permanently into thin sheets. There are\nfewer parts and fewer total pieces to\nhandle during assembly. We offer\nthreadless and multi-function fasteners\nto further meet your DFA needs.\nThese include SNAP-TOP\xc2\xae (shown in\nphoto above) and KEYHOLE\xc2\xae standoffs which eliminate the need for quick\nalignment of mating parts, P.e.\nboard fasteners and many others.\n\nFor automated installation, our\nPEMSERTER\xc2\xae press quickly installs\nPEM fasteners to gain lower total\nassembly time.\nIf you want less to give you more,\ncontact us.

Potential\napplications of these concepts include\nsteered-beam or quasi-optical microwave antennas in communication and\nradar systems, remote control of\nantennas in general , and photonic\ncommunication. These concepts\ninvolve the use of novel combinations\nof optical and electronic techniques to\ndistribute a radio-frequency signal to\nor from the antenna elements in an\narray: the phase and amplitude of the\nradio-frequency signal traveling to or\nfrom each element would be controlled\nin such a way as to cause the array as\na whole to transmit or receive the signal in the desired spatial pattern,\nwhich could be steered, narrowed,\nbroadened, or otherwise varied. The\ncomponents needed to implement the\noptical-beam-forming concepts would\nweigh less and occupy less space\nthan do the coaxial-cable and waveguide phasing signal-distribution\ncomponents of older phased array antennas.\nFigure 1 illustrates transmitting and\nreceiving configurations according to\none concept. A laser would generate\nunmodulated beams at frequencies I,\nwhich would be separated by a beam\nsplitter. One beam would be modulated\nby the information signal to be transmitted. An assembly of advanced electronically controlled spatial light modulators\nwould holographically shuffle the other\nbeam, forming it into the required spatial\npattern. A lens would then form the\nbeam into a Fourier transform of this\npattern onto a plane containing the input\napertures of optical fibers leading to the\nvarious antenna elements: the Fouriertransform pattern would correspond to\nthe required distribution of complex\namplitude across the antenna aperture.\nThe temporally modulated 12 beam\nwould be collimated and expanded,\nthen directed (along with the I , beam)\nonto the fiber-optic input plane by use\nof another frequency -selective sur24\n\nTransmitted Beam\n\n,,~.\nOptical\n\nFibers\n\neeamSpiitte,\n\nTRANSMITT1NG CONFIGURAnON\nReceived Beam\n\n~\n\nOptical\nModulator\n\nArr.aYOI .\n~ tI +\nI\n\nAntenna\n\nElements\n\n/~- I =:\' ~~-Optlcal\nFibers\n\nBeam\n\nSptitter\n\nArray 01\n\nLase,\nDiodes\n\nI\n\npOOlodelectorl\n\nRECEIVING CONFIGURAnON\n\nFigure 1.

Thus, the\nIEEE-488/LVABI interface serves as a\n28\n\nsecond interface that enables the first\ninterface to exploit the advantages of\nthe GPIB, via utility software written\nspecifically for the GPIB. The advantages of the GPIB include compatibility with multitasking and support\nof communication among multiple\ncomputers. GPIB utility software\nincludes language-interfacing libraries\nand drivers that can ease integration of\nthe IEEE-488/LVABI interface with software developed previously by the user.\n\nThe figure shows the relationships\namong the major functional blocks of\na data-communication and -processing system that includes the IEEE488/LVABI interface, which makes the\ncomplete GPIB protocol available to\nthe LVABI. This protocol includes service-request (SRQ) and direct-memory-access (OMA) features for rapid\ntransfers of data. The IEEE-488/LVABI\ninterface contains and is controlled by\na microprocessor that is, in turn, conNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\ntrolled by an internal firmware driver\nthat screens all incoming commands\nbefore passing them to the LVABI.\nThe SRQ capability enables the\nLVABI to signal the personal computer\nafter a data-acquisition cycle. This\nenables the computer to continue processing instead of polling the LVABI to\ndetermine whether the cycle has\nended. A DMA control circuit coordinates transfer of data between the\nLVABI and the computer through a\n64K-by-16-bit buffer memory. The\nIEEE-488/LVABI interface provides\nDMA transfers in either direction . The\ntransfer includes a conversion from 16\nbits parallel to 8 bits parallel when\nreading from the LVABI.\nThe basic concept of the IEEE488/LVABI interface could also be\napplied in designing interfaces for circuits other than the LVABI for unidirectional or bidirectional handling of parallel data up to 16 bits wide. Adaptations\nto other circuits would necessitate\nmodifications of the firmware of the\nIEEE-488/LVABI interface.\nThis work was done by William G.\nCulliton of Langley Research\nCenter.

Figure 1\nshows the basic transmission line\nrepresentation and a traditional layout of a microstrip Wilkinson power\ndivider. Heretofore, Wilkinson power\ndividers have ordinarily been used at\nfrequencies in the X-band (8 to 12\nGHz) and below. At higher frequencies, wavelengths become comparable to dimensions of circuit elements,\nleading to breakdown of the lumpedparameter simplifying approximations and thus to more complex and\nless predictable performance. The\nmodified configuration overcomes\nsome of these difficulties associated\nwith increasing frequency, making it\npossible to design and accurately\npredict the performances of unequalsplit power dividers for frequencies\nabove X-band.\nIn the idealized Wilkinson power\ndivider, the desired power-split ratio\nwith eq ual phase is achieved by use\nof two input branches with electrical\nlengths of 90\xc2\xb0 and with their impedances Z, and Z2 chosen to obtain\nthe desired power-split ratio. The\nlumped resistor, R, provides the\nrequired isolation between the out put po rts. Two output branc hes,\nalso with electrical lengths of 90\xc2\xb0,\nserve as quarter-wave output transformers; th eir impedances Z3 and Z4\nare chosen to match the outputs of\nth e divider to the output port impedance Zoo\nFigure 2 shows a Wilkinson power\ndivider with the modified configuration. The dimensions were chosen\nfor an operating frequency of 30.5\nGHz, an output power-split ratio of\n2:1, and input and output transmission- line impedance of 50 Q . This\ndevice was fabricated on a 0.381mm-thick substrate of dielectric co nstant 3.25 metallized with copper to\na thickness of 17. 78 ~m. In a test at\nthe design frequency, the measured\nreturn losses at all three ports\nexceeded 20 dB, and the isolation\nbetween the output ports exceeded\n17 dB.

The system\nwould involve a novel fast beam-steering subsystem that would stabilize\nonly the angle between the transmitting and receiving beams instead of\nstabilizing both the transmitting and\nreceiving lines of sight individually as\nin the older designs.\nEach station in the system would\ninclude a telescope plus associated\noptical and mechanical components\nmounted on a platform . External sensing-and-control equipment would initially turn the platform to aim the telescope approximately toward a beacon\nlaser at the remote station with which\ncommunication was to be established.\nThe focal plane of the telescope would\ncontain a charge-coupled-device\n(CCO) imaging array large enough to\nprovide a field of view wide enough to\ncapture the image of the beacon in the\npresence of initial aiming error. The\npixel resolution of the eeo array would\nbe chosen to be fine enough so that\nthe error in angular position derived\nfrom the image on the array would be\nless than the maximum aiming error\nallowed during steady operation .\nThe laser beam transmitted to the\nremote station would be reflected from\na fast-response, two-axis steering mirror on the telescope platform and sent\nout through the telescope . A beam\nsplitter would reflect a small fraction of\nthe power of the transmitted beam\nonto the eeo array (see Figure 1). The\nangular positions of the remote station\nand the transmitted beam relative to\nthe optical axis of the telescope and\nrelative to each other would be computed from the centroids of the beacon and transmitted-beam images.\nIf the two stations were moving relative to each other, then it would be\nnecessary to aim the transmitted\nbeam toward the predicted angular\nposition of the remote station corresponding to the predicted time of\n32\n\nCCDArrayal\nFocal Plane of\nTelescope\nDirection of\nApparent Motion\n\n0\'7\n\nTransmitted\nBeam\n\n\\I ~\n\n//1\\\n\nPartially\nTransmissive\nMirror\n\nBeacon Laser at\nRemote Station\n\nFast Response,\nTwo-Axis Mirror\n\n\'--\';~_ Transmitted\n\nLaser Beam\n\nFigure 1.

The scheme applies to a concatenated error-correcting channel coding communication system in which, at\nthe transmitter, the data are first encoded by an interleaved Reed-Solomon\ncode (a block code), then by a convolutional code.\nIn a two-code system of this type,\nthe first code is called the "outer" code,\nwhile the second code is called the\n"inner code ." In the receiver, the signal\nis processed first through a Viterbi\ndecoder, then through a ReedSolomon decoder. In the traditional\napproach to decoding, the two\ndecoders are simply concatenated as\ntwo distinct stages, with no feedback\nbetween them (see Figure 1).\nThe correct functioning of each\ndecoder depends on appropriate synchronization. In the Viterbi decoder, what\nis needed is node synchronization, which\nis the proper grouping of soft symbols\n(tentative or hypothesized data symbols)\nthat correspond to a single information\nbit. In the Reed-Solomon decoder, frame\nsynchronization (the detection of transport frames and the extraction of ReedSolomon words) is needed. In most\napplications, data received prior to\nachievement of synchronization are lost.\nIn cases in which bit signaJ-to-noise\nratios are high, synchronization times are\nshort and therefore losses of data are\nsmall and are usually ignored. However,\nin cases in which signal-to-noise ratios\nare low, synchronization times can be\nlong, resulting in loss of a significant fraction of all the data. Accordingly, a\nmethod of joint synchronization of both\ndecoders was conceived so that, in\neffect, each decoder can help the other\nto become synchronized, thereby shortening the overall synchronization time\nand reducing the loss of data.\nA joint-synchronization decoding system (see Figure 2) includes the customary processing units of a non-joint-synNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\nGUESS WHO\'S\n\nMONITORING\nOUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE\nWHILE YOU WATCH\nTHE SCREEN?\nt.J7ht\'n it COIIU.:J\n\n10 IIwllilortilg\n\nenclOJure.J, tht.\' Qn..Ju\'t\'r iJ AAfCO.\nOur modular construction\n\nalloW\'s you to speci f.y a single\nconsole or room encompassing\n\nsystem \'-Vith dynamic style and\nefficiency.\nAMCO base units come in\nan array of pronles\xe2\x80\xa2 Vertical\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lo"" sil houette\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sloped fronl\nthat can be combined\n\n~th\n\ninstrument cabinets, wedges.\nand turrets to create almost\n\nany desired configuration.\n\nThey ship pre-assembled.\nChoose from 19 standard colors\nand a\n\n~de\n\nrange of styles, sizes,\n\nand W\'riting surfaces.

In this system, the three algorithms are a framemarker correlator in the symbol domain,\na frame-marker correlator in the bit\ndomain, and an accumulated-metricgrowth-rate indicator. It is worth noting\nthat other synchronization-indicating\nalgorithms could also be integrated into a\njoint-synchronization decoding system\nusing the methodology below.\nThe frame-marker correlator in the bit\ndomain computes a running correlation\nbetween the frame-marker pattern of bits\nand the actual pattern of bits at the output of the Viterbi decoder. When the correlation rises from near zero to the value\nthat indicates that the frame-marker pattern is detected, the node-synchronization hypothesis is deemed to be true\nand, by definition, frame synchronization\nhas been achieved.\nThe frame-marker correlator in the\nsymbol domain computes a running correlation between (a) the soft symbols\n\n34\n\nData\n\nData\n\nIn\n\nOut\nTransmitter\n\nReceiver\n\nFigure 1. In a Decoding System Without Joint Synchronization , the two decoders operate\nindependently of each other.\n\nprior to processing in the Viterbi decoder\nand (b) the n-tuplet of soft symbols that\ncorresponds to the encoded version of\nthe frame-marker pattern. When the correlation rises to a value that indicates that\nthe frame-marker pattern has been\ndetected, it provides both frame and\nnode synchronization prior to any decoding operation. The main disadvantage of\nthis algorithm is that correlation can be\ncomputea over only part of the frame\nmarker: For a frame marker of N bits and\nconvolutional code of length K, only the\nsymbols that correspond to the last N(K+1) bits are known in the symbol\ndomain. The symbols that correspond to\nthe first K-1 bits of the frame marker are\ncorrupted by the unknown previous contents of the encoder. Depending on N, K,\nand the bit signal-to-noise ratio, the par-\n\ntial correlation may degrade the correlation signal-to-noise ratio sufficiently to\nmake synchronization difficult.\nThe accumulated-metric-growth-rate\nindicator examines the accumulated metric at all the Viterbi decoder states, computing a measure of the mismatch\nbetween the received stream of soft symbols and the stream of bits associated\nwith each specific state. Even though the\naccumulated metric varies from state to\nstate, its peak-to-peak variation is bounded by (constraint length -1) x (maximum\nbranch metric). Because of this bound, it\nis common practice to monitor the rate of\ngrowth of a single selected accumulated\nmetric for which, at high bit signaJ-tonoise ratio, there is a clear distinction\nbetween in-node synchronization and\nout-of-node synchronization. The distinc-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\nMultiple Pages Intentionally Left\nBlank\n\ntion between these two synchronization\nconditions becomes more blurry as the bit\nsignal-to-noise ratio decreases; the thresholds for detecting the in-lock and out-of-lock\nhypotheses must be chosen carefully to satisfy probability-of-detection and false-alarm\nrequirements. Unfortunately, thresholds\nmust be selected empirically, because measurement of the rate of growth does not lend\nitself to analytic expressions.\nThis work was done by Joseph I.\nStatman, Todd H.

The\ndigital front end would be part of a\nhybrid analog/digital phase-locked loop\nthat would replace an analog phaselocked loop of the prior design.

In the original\napplication, the liquid is hydrogen at low\ntemperature, but the design principles\nare applicable to measurement of the\nlevels of other dielectric liquids in various temperature ranges. The outstanding features of the design are those that\nmake the probe insensitive to temperature-induced and other spurious capacitive effects that could otherwise distort\nthe capacitive liquid-level readings, and\nthose that make it possible to calibrate\nthe probe mostly by calculation from\nfirst principles.\nThese features are achieved by careful attention to design details. The\nprobe (see figure) includes two coaxial\nsenSing electrodes and an intermediate\nshielding electrode held in alignment by\npolytetrafluoroethylene sleeves at the\nupper end. The shielding electrode\nextends only the length of the mounting\nhardware\nat\nthe\nupper\nend .\nPolytetrafluoroethylene button spacers\nmaintain the alignment between the\nsensing electrodes along the remainder\nof the length.\nIn operation, the outer electrode is\ngrounded, while the inner electrode is\ndriven by a capacitance-measurement\nvoltage at a suitable measuring frequency (e.g. , 2 kHz). The electronic measurement circuitry is located elsewhere\nin a safe environment and connected to\nthe inner and shielding electrodes via a\ncoaxial cable. Exploiting the drivenshield principle, the shielding electrode\nis excited at the same voltage as that\napplied to the central electrode: this\neliminates the contribution of the upper\nmounting-hardware length to the measured capacitance and establishes a\nsharply defined upper boundary on the\nsensing length . It also eliminates the\neffect of the coaxial cable on the measured capacitance. In so doing, it eliminates the effect of the temperature\ndependence of the permittivity of the\npolytetrafluoroethylene sleeves and of\nthe dielectric material in the coaxial\ncable. It does not eliminate the temperature-dependent effect of the polytetra40\n\nInner Conductor\nof Coaxial Cable\n\nShield of\nCoaxial Cable\n\nPolytetrafluoroethylene\nSleeves\n\nShielding Electrode\n\nSurface of Uquid ..--r-"T""-1\'~:-I--~""""--?""-1\n\nInner Electrode\n\nA\n\nJ~----____ Polytetrafluoroethylene\n\nButton Spacers\n\nThe Shielding Electrode is operated according to the driven-shield concept to eliminate\nspurious capacitive effects.\n\nfluoroethylene button spacers, but\nthese spacers are so small that their\neffect on the measured capacitance is\nnegligibly small in any event.\nWith the major spurious contributions\nto capacitance and temperature dependence of capacitance thus eliminated,\nthe only factors that affect the measured capacitance significantly are the\n\ngeometry of the electrodes, the level of\nthe liquid, and the permittivities of the\nliquid and vapor. Neglecting the fringing\neffect at the open lower end of the\nsensing electrodes, the basic theory of\nelectrostatics yields the following equation for the capacitance, C, between the\ncoaxial sensing electrodes:\nC = [L q + 0 - L)e..]21tfdln(O:!O,) where\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\nNEW FROM JlSTRO-MEDI\n\n~D Channels!\n\nBrilliant Monitor!\nHuge Memory!\nLaser Resolution elJart!\n\nTRUE FIELD RECORDER\xc2\xae\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBright, High Response Monitor\n10, 20 or 30 Waveform Channels\nLaser Quality (300 dpi) Chart Resolution\nHuge 512 KSample Memory per Channel\nfor Data Capture and Analysis\nTrue Portability: Internal BaHery and AC\nRecord up to 500 V Peak (Isolated) at 25 kHz\nResponse\nAnalyze Data with FFT, etc.\nOn-Board Floppy Drive for Setup and Memory\nTransfer\nWide Format 11-Inch Chart\n\nThe all-new Dash 10 lets you receive up to 30 waveform\nchannels (DC to 25 kHz), see the data in real time on the\nbright high-speed vacuum fluorescent monitor, record with\nlaser quality fidelity, and at the same time capture the data\nfor playback and analysis.

If,\nfor example, the outer edge of the wafer\nis attached to a rigid support. the wafer\ncan transmit vibrations directly into the\nsurrounding gas or liquid. The frequency\nresponse of piezoelectric wafers of this\ntype covers the range from dc to 100\nkHz. However, to effectively transmit\nvibrations through a medium at the low\nto mid-range portion of the audio frequency band, the wafer is coupled to a\nplanar-type diaphragm or to the cone of\na conventional loudspeaker.\nA low to mid-range audio frequency\ndriver has been developed that utilizes\nthe "rainbow" wafer as a diaphragm\nactuator replacing the voice coil and permanent magnet found in a conventional\nloudspeaker. By applying a fixed amount\nof mechanical bias or prestress to the\ndriver diaphragm and mounting the\n"rainbow" wafer in such a fashion that its\nmotion - as it becomes more flat or\nmore curved with electrical stimulus adds or subtracts a varying amount of\nmechanical bias from the fixed portion of\ndiaphragm bias, movement of the driver\ndiaphragm is produced in direct proportion to the audio voltage applied to the\nwafer, thereby giving accurate reproduction of sound.\nThe "rainbow" wafer is well suited for\nthis application since it is capable of providing 10 to 100 times the output\nmechanical motion of similar devices\nmade from conventional piezoelectric\nmaterials; unlike some conventional\npiezoelectric transducers. these produce\nadequate output motions without the\nneed for mechanical leverage devices to\namplify the motions to acceptable levels.\nIn selecting a wafer for use as a\ndiaphragm actuator, the chemical composition, thickness. size. stiffness, and\nmass are considered for optimum transformation of the varying electrical potential to diaphragm motion. Important\napplications foreseen for these improved\npiezoelectric drivers include high-fidelity\nloudspeakers, and underwater echo\nranging devices.\nThis work was done by Curtis Randall\nRegan, Antony Jalink, Richard F\nHellbaum, and Wayne W Rohrbach of\nLangley Research Center.

Changing shadowing\nby buildings, vegetation, and terrain\ncauses frequent and severe fading of\nsignals, giving rise to a need for fast\nreacquisition of (that is, fast recovery of\nsynchronization with) the signals. In the\nabsence of a midband pilot signal,\ncoherent demodulation is not an appropriate choice for fast reacquisition in the\nfading environment. The proposed\npseudocoherent demodulation would\nenable fast reacquisition . It would also\namount to a compromise between the\ntwo extremes of (a) coherent demodulation and (b) differentially coherent\ndemodulation, for which the bit-error\nrates are greater than those of coherent\ndemodulation by amounts that correspond to a difference of about 1 dB in\nthe bit-energy/ noise-energy ratio.\nThe proposed schemes (see figure)\nare based on maximum-likelihood estimation and detection during N-symbol\nobservation periods, where N is an integer that is typically chosen between 5\nand 15. The first scheme could be used\nif there were an external frequency estimator with very small frequency error\nvariance. This scheme is based on maximum -likelihood estimation of carrier\nphase, assuming that the unknown frequency offset is perfectly compensated\nby the frequency estimator prior to the\nphase-estimation process.\nThe second scheme could be used if\nthe frequency offset were small or if the\nreceiver were equipped with an external\nfrequency estimator. This scheme is\nbased on direct maximum-likelihood\nestimation of a time-varying phase\ncaused by the presence of the frequency offset. Because of the time-varying\nphase and the structure of the maximum-likelihood estimator, the demodulator is equipped with a 1800 -phasejump detector to resolve the periodic\n180\xc2\xb0 phase ambiguities. Without the\nphase-jump detector, the differential\ndecoder would fail at the end of each\n1800 -phase-jump period.

The point of departure for the theoretical development of the NCPE is\nrecognition of the fact that a system that\ngenerates a CPM waveform can be\ndecomposed into a time-invariant CPE\nand a time-invariant memoryless modulator (MM). This decomposition of CPM\nmakes it possible to consider the CPE\nand the MM separately. The NCPE would\noperate in conjunction with an MM.\nIn a simple CPE, one signal from an\nalphabet of 2q signals is used to transmit\nq-1 bits per time interval with a trelliscoded-modulation (TCM) scheme of rate\n(q-1)/q. In the NCPE, one signal from an\nalphabet of 2Nq (which takes N time intervals) would be used to transmit Nq-1 bits\nevery N time intervals with a TCM\nscheme of rate (Nq- 1)INq, i.e. , the NCPE\nmakes it possible to design a binary\npreencoder with a rate higher than that of\na simple CPE. Specifically, instead of\nadding one redundant bit every time slot\nof the CPM system, one redundant bit\nwould be added every N time slots.\nOne special case of the generic NCPE\nis that of a trellis encoder for two consecutive quaternary (M = 4) CPSK signals. The top part of Figure 1 shows the\nstate trellis structure of the CPE for the\n\ncase of full-response CPM of modulation\nindex 11M , whereM=4. BycombiningN\ntime slots together, one can make the\nstate trellis structure for an arbitrary window of duration NT (where T = the symbol period) for M = 4. This trellis structure, shown in the bottom part of Figure\n1, can be implemented by the NCPE.\nThere are MN branches leaving each\nstate; these branches can be viewed as\nM bundles (which are represented by\nbold lines in the bottom part of Figure 1)\nand each bundle contains MN-1 branches, so that each bundle represents M""\nparallel transitions. Each branch specifies\nan N-consecutive CPM signal of duration\nNT. Therefore, each branch in the bottom\npart of Figure 1 can be represented by an\n(N+ 1)-dimensional vector, the elements of\nwhich are from the set, (D,1 ,2,3,oo. ,M-1) .\nIn a theoretical design study, the case\nwas specialized further to N = 2 and by\nuse of a set-partitioning technique, a\nconceptual preencoder for two-state,\ntrellis-coded, 4-CPFSK with a coding\nrate of 3/4 was designed. Figure 2 shows\nsome results of a numerical simulation\nand an asymptotic analysis of performance of a conceptual system that contains the conceptual encoder, in comparison with the corresponding results for an\nuncoded conceptual 4-CPSK system.\n\nThese results show that the performance\nwith coding can be expected to exceed\nthat without coding by the equivalent of\nseveral dB in the bit signal-to-noise ratio.\nThis work was done by Oariush\nOivsalar of Caltech and Ho-Kyoung Lee\nand Charles Weber of the University of\nSouthern California for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Called "parallel digital phaselocked loops" to distinguish them from\nother digital phase-locked loops, these\nsystems were conceived as a costeffective solution to the problem of filtering Signals at the high sampling rates\nneeded to accommodate the wide input\nfrequency bands. A computer simulation\nshowed that the performance of a parallel digital phase-locked loop would be\nequivalent to that of a conventional one.\nIn a typical application like the one\nthat motivated this development, the\nincoming signal is a sinusoid with a frequency of tens of gigahertz. The signal is\nDoppler-shifted such that it might be\nfound anywhere within a frequency band\n500 MHz wide. The Nyquist sampling\ncriterion therefore requires a sampling\n\nrate of at least 1 GHz for tracking the\nphase and frequency of the Dopplershifted signal. Although advances in digital integrated circuitry have made it possible to sample at such a high rate, it is\nstill not cost effective to perform filtering\nat rates above 100 MHz.\nA system of the proposed type would\ncircumvent this obstacle, making it possible to use digital signal-processing circuitry that operates at clock speeds of\n75 MHz or less. It would do this byeffectively dividing the spectrum of the\nincoming sampled, digitized signal into\nM parts, each of which would be\nprocessed by digital filtering circuits at\n11M x the full sampling rate. For example, in the original application, M could\nbe 20, so that each digital filter would\noperate at a clock speed of 50 MHz.\nIn the proposed filtering scheme, the\nsampled, digitized signal would be fed\nto a bank of M subband digital filters,\neach of which WOUld, itself, be a subbank containing M stages of filtering and\n\nof decimation by a factor of M (see fig ure). The outputs of the parallel digital filters would be fed to the digital phaselocked loop via a multiplexer. Inasmuch\nas the input signal would be a continuous-wave tone, it would occupy only\none filter at any given time; therefore,\nonly the output of that filter would have\nto be processed by the digital phaselocked loop. Accordingly, the multiplexer\nwould operate under control of an algorithm that would select the applicable filter on the basis of the estimated\nDoppler frequency shift, the estimated\nfrequency of the sampled, digitized input\nsignal, and the frequency of the numbercontrolled oscillator in the digital phaselocked loop.\nThis work was done by Ramin Sadr,\nBiren N.

The technique also exploits the\nfact that in multilook SAR data processing, the total bandwidth of each\nSAR polarization channel is divided into\nN (typically, N = 16) equal frequency\nchannels, the data in each of which are\nprocessed separately.\nHeretofore, the results of such frequency-channelized processing have\nnot been saved as output data\nbecause they have constituted intermediate data products. However, in the\npresent technique, the results from the\nN channels are regarded as N coregistered but otherwise independent sets\nof data, each constituting a picture of\nthe SAR backscatter at a unique squint\nangle. The juxtaposition of data from\nthe N channels can thus be used to\nstudy the radar backscatter from the\n\nscene as viewed from different azimuth\nangles or, equivalently, from different\npositions along the ground track of the\nSAR aircraft.\nIn the original application for which\nthis technique was devised, it was used\nto study the variation in the radarbackscatter cross section of agricultural fields as a function of direction\nangles. As shown in the figure, the\ndirection angle is defined as the angle\nbetween the furrows in a field and the\nplane of incidence of the radar beam.\nThe maximum backscatter is expected\nto occur when the radar beam is looking across the furrows; that is, when\nthe direction angle is 0\xc2\xb0; this effect is\ncalled the Cardinal effect. When the\npresent technique was applied to SAR\ndata from agricultural fields in La\nMancha, Spain, the Cardinal effect was\nindeed observed, although the variation\nwith direction angle was even stronger\nthan predicted, especially near 5\xc2\xb0. It\nhas been conjectured that Bragg resonance, which was not included in the\n\nmathematical model used previously to\ncompute the Cardinal effect, could be\nthe main cause of the stronger\nobserved angular dependence.\nThis work was done by Pascale C.\nDubois, Eric J. Rignot, and Jacob J.\nvan Zyl of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

In the original intended\napplication, the vanes and probes\nwould be thrust-vector-control devices\ninserted in supersonic flows of hot\ngases in rocket-engine nozzles; this\ncooling concept may also be applicable\nto vanes and blades in high-performance turbine engines.\nAccording to an older version of this\ncooling concept, liquid metal boils inside a vane or probe, carrying away\nheat in the resulting convection current.\nIn experiments on vanes and probes\n54\n\ninserted in solid-propellant rocket-motor\nnozzles during operation, coolant vapor\npressures were found to be excessive,\nand convection currents alone were not\nable to transfer sufficient heat to external coolant reservoirs; as a result, the\noperating lifetimes of the vanes and\nprobes were of the order of only 20 s.\nThe jet pump in the proposed version\nwould provide additional circulation of\ncoolant in the form of vapor-pumped\njets of liquid coolant, analogous to the\nperiodiC jets of steam-pumped liquid\nwater in a coffee percolator. The pump\nand a recirculating tube attached to it\nwould be implanted in the tip of the\nvane or probe to be cooled. As in the\n\ncoffee percolator, the coolant vapor\nwould periodically force a jet of boiling\ncoolant liquid from the hottest part of\nthe vane or probe, out through the recirculation tube, and into the coolant\nreservoir, where it would deposit its heat\nin the solid coolant, causing the solid\ncoolant to melt. The melted coolant\nwould then circulate within the cooling\npassages of the vane or probe. The frequency of repetition of jets would typically range up to several hundred cycles\nper second.\nIn a further improvement, additional\naxial and transverse slots would be\nadded to the coolant passages in the\nvane or probe and to the coolant reserNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\nOUR LAsER Is WEI I\n\nI\n\nKNOWN\n\nAROUND THESE PARfS.\n\nColor Marking on\nAnodizedAluminum\n\nEngraving Wood\n\nMarking Microprocessors\n\nCutting Plexighs\n\nCutting Paper\n\nWIre Stripping\n\nTextile Cutting\n\nCutting Wood\n\nMarking Plastic\n\nCutting and Welding Plastic\n\nRubber Stamps\n\nGasket Manufacturing\n\nD\nata I/O\n\nSilicon \\blley\n011 PM7000\n0.

SOl wafers are important\nbecause it is likely that in the future,\nlow-power very-large-scale integrated\ncircuits will be fabricated on them. An\nSOl wafer consists of a thin layer of silicon (e.g., tens to hundreds of\nnanometers thick) on a layer of silicon\noxide (e.g., about 1 IJm thick) on a silicon substrate of convenient thickness.\nIt is desirable to be able to characterize the silicon and silicon oxide layers in order to assess the uniformity\nand quality of SOl wafers and of circuitry fabricated on them. AOTF-PHI\nwas originally developed for use in\nremote sensing, but it also affords\ncapabilities that are attractive for characterization of SOl wafers. AOTF-PHI\noffers high spectral resolution (fractional wavelength resolution of 10-2 to 10....)\nand both ease and rapidity of opticalwavelength tuning (one need only\nchange the frequency of the radio-frequency signal used to excite a transducer on an AOTF) .\nThe method takes advantage of the\nfact that the silicon and silicon oxide\nlayers are thin enough to give rise to\ninterference patterns in white light.\nAccordingly, an SOl wafer to be characterized is illuminated with white light\nand an AOTF-PHI apparatus is used\n(see Figure 1) to decompose the\nresulting image (spatial interference\npattern) into spectral and polarization\n\nTHE MOST FLEXIBLE 3-D DIGITIZER AVAILABLE \xe2\x80\xa2 It\'s portable, works in\nany environment, digitizes any material, and has easy RS-232 interface.\nIdeal for reverse engineering ... acquiring 3-D data from prototypes ...\ndefining tool paths ... generating data for 3-D graphics, plus applications only limited by your imagination.\nSEE HOW THE\n\nGP-12 CAN PUT\n\nYOU INTO THE WORLO OF 3-~.

This would enable characterization of SOl wafers in real time for online monitoring and adjustment of production.

This method offers a\nrapid , nondestructive alternative to\ndestructive metallographic sectioning\nto obtain a picture of the inhomogeneity of a specimen. It would take about a\nmonth of work by a skilled technician\nto obtain the equivalent information by\nmetallographic sectioning.\nDry ultrasonic coupling is not new,\nbut heretofore it has been applied to\nmeasurement at one location. In the\npresent method, it is applied in a computer-controlled scan across a surface\nof the specimen , and the data\nacquired in the scan are digitized and\nprocessed by use of interactive software to obtain maps of the velocities\nof sound. Local variations in this map\ncan be correlated with local variations\nin pore volume fractions.\nIn ultrasonic measurement by use of\nwet coupling, the ultrasonic transducer\nand the specimen or at least part of the\nspecimen are immersed in water or\nother suitable liquid. If the specimen is\nporous, the liquid can enter pores and\nthereby alter the ultrasonic properties\nof the specimen in such a way as to\nmask or distort the quantities that one\nseeks to measure. In some cases, the\nliquid can react chemically with the\nspecimen. Dry coupling does not entail\nthese disadvantages.\nWhereas liquid coupling supports\nthe propagation of longitudinal (compressional) sound waves only, dry\ncoupling supports the propagation of\ntransverse (shear) waves as well as\nlongitudinal waves. This makes it possible to extract more information\nabout the specimen by using waves\nof both types. For one thing, transverse waves may provide increased\nsensitivity for detection of some\ndefects. Furthermore, maps of\nPoisson\'s ratio (v) can be constructed\nfrom maps of the longitudinal- and\nshear-wave velocities (VL and Vs ,\nrespectively) by use of v = [(VL 2/2) Vs2)1(VL2 - Vs\').\nThe velocity and Poisson\'s-ratio\nmaps (see Figure 2) assist in the\ndevelopment of materials and fabrication of material specimens by reveali ng\n58\n\nL,\n\n_Ultrasonic\nTransducer\n/\n\nThin Layer of Solid\nCoupling Material\n\nr---~-.~~---.\n\nSpecimen\n\nSIDE VIEW\n\nTOP VIEW SHOWING SUCCESSIVE TRANSDUCER\nPOSITIONS IN PART OF SCAN PATTERN\n\nFigure 1.

In the present technique, a\nthird (probing) laser beam, variably\ndelayed from the pumping beams, is\nmade to pass through this laserinduced grating . The laser-induced\ngrating diffracts the probing beam, and\nthe diffraction efficiency varies with the\nacoustic oscillation.

The technique is potentially adaptable to other materials, especially in process-monitoring applications in\nwhich it is necessary to know and control\ncritical properties of products via quantitative chemical analyses of the products.\nThus, in addition to chemical composition, the technique could also be used to\ndetermine such physical properties as\ndensities and strengths.\nIn the application of the technique to\nthe sprayed foam, a specimen of the\nfoam is quantitatively analyzed by one or\nmore techniques, yielding N different\nmeasurements XI (i = 1 to M).

On the other\nhand, ceramics prepared at temperatures more than 100 K lower were significantly weakened, and samples prepared by rapid firing at much higher\ntemperatures had densities SUbstantially below 100 percent, which gives rise\nto degraded conduction behavior.\nIn an effort to identify processing conditions that would yield improved KBASE, the applicable chemical kinetics\nwere analyzed: The kinetics of decomposition of the potassium B" -alumina-phase,\nchanges in decomposition, changes in\ncrystal structure, and sintering were\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\nmapped with respect to temperature and\nchemical activity in a series of tests to\ndetermine processing conditions for producing superior K-BASE ceramics by ion\nexchange with KCI vapor.\nIn the improved process, the NaBASE ceramic pieces to be converted\nto K-BASE ceramic are covered with a\nblanket of finely divided, K20-rich KBASE powder to control K20 activity\nduring subsequent ion exchange with\nKCI vapor/air or KCI vapor/ oxygen\nmixture (or, alternatively, K20 vapor\nfrom a KAI0 2 source) at a typical temperature of 1,625 K. At this temperature, creep (annealing) occurs without\ndecomposition of the B" -alumina\nphase and without loss of K2 0 as long\nas the K20 activity is maintained.

The addition of metal\nparticles contributes additional thermal conductMty, thereby\nreducing thermal gradients and the associated thermal stresses,\nwith resultant enhancements of thermal stability. Because values\nof n in the composite films can be made large, the same optical\neffects can be achieved with lesser thicknesses. By decreasing\nthe thicknesses of the films, one not only decreases their weights\nbut also contributes further to reductions of thermal stresses.\nEarty development efforts have been directed toward deposition of films that would exhibit high emissivity (equivalently, high\nabsorptivity) at wavelengths from 5 to 50 IJm and high reflectivity (equivalently, low emissivity or absorptivity) at wavelengths\nfrom 50 to 1,000 IJm. Films of amorphous (with respect to crystalline structure) Ge containing Ag particles and amorphous Si\ncontaining Au particles have been deposited by cosputtering.\nThe cosputtering process offers advantages of scalability and\nsuitability for deposition on surfaces of lightweight composite-material structures. Furthermore, residual stresses in\ndeposited films can be controlled through selection of\nprocess parameters.\nThe experimental Ge:Ag and Si:Au films made by cosputtering exhibited enhanced nand k, as expected, with measured\nvalues that approximate theoretically computed values. One of\nthe predicted and measured characteristics of these films illustrates an advantage over dielectric films that have been developed for the same purposes: Attempts to extend the absorption\nproperties of dielectric films into the infrared spectral region\nhave resulted in undesirably low emissivities at some wavelengths and in undesired oscillations in reflectivities as functions\nof wavelength. However, the composite films do not exhibit\nthese oscillations; instead, they exhibit broadband reflectivities\nand absorptivities.\nThis work was done by James L. Lamb and Channamallappa\nL.

In\nsuch a cell, an aqueous solution of methanol, formaldehyde, or\nother water-soluble organic fuel is circulated past an anode,\nwhere the fuel is oxidized. A commercially available electrode\nfor the oxidation of organic fuels usually contains 15 to 30 percent polytetraftuoroethylene (PTFE) as a binder, and works only\nwith gaseous fuel. To make such an electrode work with liquid\nfuel, one must coat or impregnate it with a suitable wetting\nagent that does not interfere with the kinetics of oxidation or\ndegrade the electrode.\nNafion \xe2\x84\xa2 was investigated for use in this application because\nof its known combination of desirable characteristics: It is a\nperfluorinated, hydrophilic, proton-conducting ion-exchange\npolymer that exhibits relatively high thermal and electrochemical stability and is not detrimental to the kinetics of electroNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\nchemical processes.

The NTP-engine-based liquid\ndesign models available heretofore lack\nthe integrated design of key NTPengine-design features in such areas as\nreactor, shielding, multi-propellant\ncapability, and multiply-redundant\npump-feed fuel systems.\nNESS is intended to support current\nand future efforts to perform design\nstudies of engine systems and stages.\nIn the development of NESS, the NTP\nversion of the Expanded Uquid Engine\nSimulation (ELES) computer program of\nScience Applications International\nCorp. (SAIC) was modified extensively\nto include Westinghouse Electric\nCorporation\'s near-term and next-gen68\n\neration solid-core-reactor design mathematical models - ENABLER I and\nENABLER II , respectively. These models\nare based on the near-term and\nupgraded versions of the solid-core\nENABLER NTP reactor-design concept.\nThe ENABLER I model provides a nearterm solid-core reactor design based on\nthe NERVA reactor. ENABLER II provides a more advanced reactor design,\nwith flow paths and scaled fuel , reflecting state-of-the-art technology, and\nyielding reactor designs with higher\npower densities and lower weights.\nThe NESS computer code is used for\nrapid, preliminary detailed design analysis of both the reactor and key engine\nsystems. This code designs the reactor,\nturbomachinery, tankage, nozzle, lines,\nand valves in terms of both weight and\noperating characteristics . NESS is\ncapable of modeling expander, gasgenerator, and bleed cycles, along with\nmultiply-redundant propellant-pump\nfeed systems. Engine systems can be\ndesigned and evaluated for both pumpout and normal operating conditions,\nwith an option available for automated\niteration of pump design to satisfy both\noperating conditions. Turbopumpdesign options include the efficient axial\nmultistage pump along with the traditional centrifugal pump.\nPrincipal outputs of NESS include (1)\noperating characteristics and weights\nof reactors, (2) such engine-system\nparameters as performances, weights,\ndimensions, pressures, temperatures,\nand mass flows, and (3) operating characteristics of turbopumps under both\ndesign and off-design operating conditions.

It was\ndesigned to account for the effects on\ncreep-fatigue life of complex loadings\nthat involve such factors as thermomechanical fatigue, hold periods, waveshapes, mean stresses, multiaxiality,\ncumulative damage, coatings, and\nenvironmental attack. Several features\nof COA make it practical for application\nto actual component analysis using\nmodern finite-element or boundary-element methods. Although it has been\ndeveloped for use in predicting the\ncrack-initiation lifetimes of gas-turbineengine materials, it can be applied to\nother materials as well.\nCOA implements a mathematical\nmodel based on continuously cycled\nisothermal fatigue testing and includes\nmany features that make it well suited\nfor use with modern high-temperature\nmaterials. It uses total strain rather than\ninelastic strain for the basic life prediction; this is especially important for the\ndesign of gas turbine engines, since\ntypical components have small inelastic\nstrains when they are designed for useful lives in the thousands of cycles.\nRatios for stresses and other calculated\nquantities are calculated with respect to\nreference conditions, rather than\nabsolute levels; this helps to reduce the\nsensitivity to the accuracy of the constitutive modeling.

Metallic coatings\nare routinely used in gas turbine\nengines to protect hot-section airfoils\nfrom environmental degradation. With\nthe addition of the coatings, however,\nturbine-airfoil-life prediction is complicated because the coatings are primary\nfatigue-crack-initiation sites. LAYER is\nintended to provide gas-turbine-airfoil\ndesigners with means to accurately\nproject service lifetimes.\nGiven the differences in thermal\nexpansion and creep between the coating and substrate alloys, nonlinear\nanalysis of the cyclic history of a coating/substrate composite is considered\nnecessary for accurate life prediction.\nAlthough nonlinear turbine-airfoil analyses have been executed for uncoated\nairfoils, the highly nonlinear coating\nbehavior essentially eliminates the pos-\n\nsibility of conducting coated-airfoil\nanalyses within an acceptable time\nframe. LAYER, which implements a simplified structural-analysis technique, has\nbeen developed to analyze the nonlinear\nbehavior of such a composite at a predetermined critical location.\nThe base airfoil material considered is\nthe Pratt & Whitney Aircraft single-crystal alloy PWA-1480. Two different generic types of oxidation-resistant metallic\ncoating are considered . The first, PWA286, is a low-pressure-plasma-sprayed\n(LPPS) NiCoCrAIY overlay coating.

Although\nLAYER has been developed for predicting crack initiation in metallic coated\nPWA-1480, it can be extended to other\nmaterials as well.\nInput to the LAYER code can come\nfrom any available elastic or nonlinear\ncomponent cyclic analysis - finite element, boundary integral element, or\nhand calculation. The LAYER code can\nreadily include the influence of multiaxial\nloading on crack-initiation life; for example, the biaxial effect of coating/substrate thermal-expansion mismatch that\noccurs during thermal cycling.\nLAYER is written in FORTRAN 77 for\nIBM PC-series and compatible computers running OS/2 2.1 and Sun-series\ncomputers running SunOS 4.x.

In essence, the PIND apparatus\nand program implement an instrumented and computerized version of the intuitive "shake-and-rattle" method.\nTypically, the extraneous particles in\npressure sensors consist of such manufacturing debris as solder balls , metallic\nshavings, and wire fragments; it is necessary to detect and eliminate them\nbecause they give rise to spurious peaks\nand depressions in sensor readings.\nAlthough the particles could be found by\ndisassembly and visual inspection of the\ninsides or by x-ray inspection without\ndisassembly, it is not practical to perform such close inspection of every sensor in a system that contains many sensors. The PIND method was devised as\na practical alternative.\nA PIND tester is essentially a shaker\nequipped with a microphone that measures the noise in the pressure sensor or\nother object being shaken. The shaker\napplies a controlled vibration (e.g., a\ndamped sinusoidal acceleration). The\noutput of the microphone is recorded\nand expressed in terms of voltage, yielding a history of noise that is subsequently processed by the computer program.\nData are taken at a sampling rate suffi-\n\nciently high (10,000 samples/second) to\nenable identification of all impacts of\nparticles on the sensor diaphragm and\non the inner surfaces of sensor cavities .\nThe computer program helps to analyze the statistical characteristics of the\nmeasurement data. In general, the\namplitude of a noise peak generated by\nimpact of a particle is proportional to the\nmass of a particle, and the overall noise\nlevel increases with the number of parti cles . A PIND test of a sensor that contains a large number of trapped particles\nyields many noise peaks with large and\nwidely differing magnitudes. The program sorts out all maxima (three consecutive points with their points changing from positive to negative) and minima (three consecutive points with their\nslopes changing from negative to positive) and then arranges them in order of\nascending amplitude.\nFor a random noise signal, either a\nmaxima or a minima can have a positive\nor negative value in amplitude. The range\nof amplitude of both maxima and minima\nis divided into a number of bins specified\nby the user. The sorted maxima and minima are placed into these bins according\nto their amplitude. The number of occurrences in each bin is then plotted against\na value of amplitude representative of the\ndata in the bin (see figure). The distributions of maxima and minima on plots\ngenerated in this way show large stan-\n\nQuietest Sensor-\n\nc\n\nill\n0\n\n\'"\n\nw\n.~\nU>\nQ)\n\n~\n\n~ --\n\nr.\n\n360\n300\n\n~\n\n~\n\n"\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\nQ;\n\n\'"\n\nw 375\n.~\nU>\n\n"\n\n225\n\n0\n\nI\n\n"0 150\n\n+-----;-- -\n\nQ;\n\n120\n\n.0\n\nE\n\n=>\nZ\n\n60\n0\n\n300\n\n~\n\n0\n0\n\n180\n\n450\n\n0\n\nQ)\n\n~--\n\nE\n\n~\n\nffi\nr.\n\nc\n\n240\n\n"0\n\n.0\n\n525\n\n0\n\n0\n\nc\n\ndard deviations in the case of a sensor\nthat contains many trapped particles,\nbecause testing of such a sensor generates a large number of peaks that are\naway from the mean value. Furthermore,\nthe larger the amplitude of the noise\nlevel, the larger is the mass of the particles. On the other hand, the plot made\nfrom a test of a relatively quiet sensor\nthat contains few trapped particles\nexhibits a small standard deviation,\nbecause most of the peaks are clustered\naround the mean value.\nThe capability of the PIND-testlcomputer analysis method to identify sensors that\ncontain extraneous particles has been\nconfirmed by x-ray and visual inspections.\nComputer analysis correctly identified (a)\nthe one of several sensors that contained\nthe largest amount of extranecus material\nand (b) the one of several sensors that\ncontained the heaviest single trapped particle. The only limitation of the method\noccurs in a case of an extranecus particle\nthat cannot be detected by PIND testing\nbecause it is lodged tightly in a confined\nspace inside the sensor. Fortunately, however, a tightly lodged particle does not contaminate a sensor reading.\nThis work was done by Lloyd C. Kwok\nof Rockwell International Corp. for\nMarshall Space Flight Center.

The bolt head\ndesign allows an interface for an ultrasonic transducer to be\ninstalled, while a shallow chamfered circumferential groove on\nthe bolt shank contains four strain gauges at equal angular\nintervals wired as a full-bridge transducer (see figure) .\n\n74\n\nFor More Inf ormation Write In No. 433\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\nThe doubly instrumented bolt was\ndevised for use in studying errors in\nultrasonic measurements of bolt loads.\nAn objective of such a study is to make\nit possible to rely on ultrasonic measurements in the future by making suitable\ncorrections in design, fabrication, and/or\ntesting. In the application that prompted\nthis development, three standard deviations of the errors in ultrasonically determined bolt loads amounted to somewhat more than 21 percent, whereas a\nthree-standard-deviation error of no\nmore than 10 percent is considered\n\nUltrasonic Transducer Can Be\nMounted on Interface Inside Bolt Head\n\nWires to\nStrain\nGauges\n\n"F~~_ Four Strain\n\nAfter more than 25 years manufacturing this remarkable\nfamily of products we continue to be amazed at how our\ncustomers utilize them to improve their designs.\nWe thought you might be interested in just a few.\n\nMetal Belt & Drive Tape\n\nAPPLICATIONS\nPlain &Perforated Belts\nConveying, Casting,\nImaging, Sealing,\nTiming, Positioning, Indexing,\nVacuum Conveying, Drying\n\nGauges at\nEqual Angular\nIntervals\n\nBelts with Attachments\nThe Instrumented Bolt accommodates\nfour strain gauges mounted in the shallow\ngroove on the shank, plus an ultrasonic\ntransducer in the head.\n\nacceptable in that application. Strain\ngauges are suitable for use as standards\nof comparison because they can provide\nload measurements with errors of only\n0.7 - 2.0 percent.\nThe groove that holds the strain\ngauges is cut to a depth less than that of\nthe bolt thread. This depth is small\nenough not to weaken the shank significantly or interfere with an ultrasonic signal. The edges of the groove are chamfered at 45\xc2\xb0 to reduce reflection of ultrasound from them. The strain-gauge\nleads are brought out of the bolt head\nthrough a narrow axial passage and an\naxial groove cut at the same depth as\nthe circumferential groove. Standard\nstrain-gauge mounting methods are\nused, with compensation for effects of\nbending and temperature.\nThis work was done by O. E. Smith, G.\nR. Metvick, T. J. Klundt, R. L. Everton,\nand M.

There is also no need for\na lubricant fluid that could contaminate\nthe fluid to be compressed . Still another\nand very important advantage is that\nthis compressor can operate continuously, eliminating the troublesome\non/off cycling (and the concomitant\nvoltage and current transients) of other\ncompressors, and decreasing the consumption of energy.\nThe compressor (see figure) includes\na stack of cells, each containing a dry,\nfine stainless-steel powder supported\nby a screen. The stainless steel has a\nhigh iron content (about 85 percent) so\nthat the powder is magnetizable. The\nparticles of powder are approximately\nspherical, with a diameter of about 38\njJm. The screen is made of a mesh that\nis coarse enough to allow the fluid to\nflow freely, but fine enough to retain\nthe powder.\nAn electromagnet coil is wrapped\naround each cell. When the coil in a first\ncell is not energized, the powder in that\ncell is loose, and the fluid can flow\nthrough it relatively easily. When the coil\nis energized, the resulting magnetic\nfield packs the powder particles\ntogether tightly, restricting the flow of\nfluid. The magnetic field also causes\nthe mass of powder to expand somewhat, as a solid piston, compressing\nthe fluid into the space above. The fluid\nthus flows into a second cell, in which\nthe electromagnet coil is initially unenergized so that the fluid can flow into it.\nThe electromagnet coil in the second\ncell is then energized, forCing the fluid\ninto a third cell, and so forth.\nThe excitation of the coils is phased,\nunder microprocessor control, to pass\na volume of fluid from cell to cell. The\nfluid acquires a higher pressure in each\nsuccessive cell. When a powder piston\nhas forced the fluid toward the powder\npiston in the next cell, its coil is deener76\n\nHigh-Pressure\nFluid Out\n\nt t t t\n\nFilter To Trap Loose\nPowder Particles\n\n\'II;\n\nt}\ndP\' ()\n\nt \\\n\'On \\0 C}\n\n~\\\'\\\n\n~\n\n~O-(Qroou\n\nMagnetic\n\nPowder\nParticles\n\nd[ZJ~D td~screen\n\nt t 1\n\nt\n\nELECTROMAGNET COIL\nNOT ENERGIZED\n\nELECTROMAGNET COIL\nENERGIZED\nLow-Pressure\nFluid In\n\nPhased Cells push fluid from bottom to top, adding increments of pressure as they do.

The modified torch can\nbe used in both keyhole and non keyhole\nwelding modes.\nThe modification consists in the addition of a swirl ring inside the torch, as\nshown in the figure. The swirl ring contains four channels and it surrounds the\nwelding electrode, so that gas that flows\nalong the electrode is forced to flow\nalong these channels. Angled holes at\nthe downstream end of the channels\ncause the gas to flow out with a swirling\nmotion, forming the desired vortex.\nThe vortex results in a narrower and\nmore nearly symmetrical weld bead and\na narrower heat -affected zone than are\ncontained in conventional plasma arc\nwelding without the vortex. Degradation\nof the electrode and orifice is more uniform with the vortex welding arc, and the\nneed to rotate the torch during operation\nto compensate for asymmetry in the arc\nis reduced or eliminated.\nThis work was done by William F\nMcGee and Daniel J.

A\nnumerical method must be used\nbecause the nature of the equations is\n\n78\n\nsuch that closed-form algebraic solutions do not exist as they do for parallel-axis gears (spur gears). The numerical solutions for the surface coordinates are needed to generate mathematical models of tooth surfaces for\n\nuse in finite-element analyses of stresses, strains, and vibrations in meshing\nspiral-bevel gears.\nThe governing equations describe\nthe basic gear design and the kinematics of the cutting or grinding machinery\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\nused to fabricate the gear. The surface of a gear is an envelope of the\nfamily of surfaces traced out by the\nmotion of the surface of the head\ncutter that is used to machine the\ngear. The pOints on the tooth surface\ngenerated by the motion of the cutter\nare points of tangency to the cutter\nsurface during cutting. The conditions necessary for existence of the\nenvelope are expressed by the equation of meshing, which states that a\nline perpendicular to the generating\nsurface must be perpendicular to the\nrelative velocity between the cutter\nand the gear-tooth surface at the\npoint in question.\nCoordinate transformations constitute an important part of the problem.\nIt is necessary to be able to locate any\npoint on the surface of the head cutter\nin a coordinate system rigidly attached\nto the gear being cut. Homogeneous\ncoordinates are used for this purpose\nso that rotations and translations of\nvectors can be described simply by\nmultiplying transformation matrices.\nThe matrices are derived from equations that describe the shape of the\nhead cutter and the motions of the\nhead cutter and the workpiece in the\nstationary coordinate system of the\ngear-cutting machine.\nThe transformation equation obtained\nfrom the matrix multiplications gives the\nlocation of a surface point, in the coordinate system attached to the gear, as\na function of (a) the machine-tool settings, (b) basic gear-design data, and\n(c) the parameters u, e, and <Pc\' In this\nequation, U and e are coordinates of a\npoint on the surface of the head cutter\nin a coordinate system attached to the\nhead cutter, while <Pc is the roll angle of\nthe cradle, which is part of the gear-cutting machinery as shown schematically\nin Figure 1.\nThe problem then becomes one of\nfinding the values of the parameters u,\ne, and <Pc to insert in this equation to\ngenerate the surface coordinates. The\ncorrect values are those that satisfy\nthe equation of meshing. Three equations that are nonlinear in these parameters are derived. Because they are\nnonlinear, they are solved numerically\nby use of commercially available subroutines. A program called "SURFACE" incorporates these subroutines\nand solves the equations to generate\ncoordinates for a 1O-by-1 0 grid of\nsurface points on each side of the\ngear tooth. The coordinates are then\nfed to the PATRAN computer program, which uses them to generate a\nfinite-element mathematical model of\nthe gear (see Figure 2).\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1995\n\nTOP VIEW\n\nCradle Housing\n\nMachine Center\n\nFRONT VIEW\n\nFigure 1.

LEW-15916\n\nAutomated Inspection and\nPrecise Grinding of Gears\nAutomated inspection provides corrections that\nincrease the precision of machine tool settings.\nLewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA method of precise grinding of spiral bevel gears involves\nautomated inspection of gear-tooth surfaces followed by\nadjustments of machine-tool settings to minimize differences\nbetween the actual and nominal surfaces. In many respects,\nthis method is similar to the method described in\n"Computerized Inspection of Gear-Tooth Surfaces" (LEW15736), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 18, No.7 (July, 1994), page 73.\nThis method eliminates most of the subjective decision-making\ninvolved in an older inspection method, in which an inspector\ncompares contact patterns obtained by running sets of gears\nunder light load in a rolling-test machine. The automatedinspection method yields gears of higher quality, with significant\nreduction in manufacturing and inspection time.

Nominal Points of Contact\nbetween the probe and the gear-tooth surface define a grid for mapping the surface\nand comparing with the corresponding surface of the master gear.\nthe reduction in time is about 7 3/4\nhours, and cost is reduced accordingly.\nIn this method, automated in-process\ninspection of spiral bevel gears is\naccomplished by use of a computer-controlled multiple-axis coordinate-measuring\nmachine with a contact probe (see Figure\n1). The machine operates in conjunction\nwith software that both (1) enables rapid\noptimization of the spiral bevel gear-tooth\ngeometry during initial development of\nthe tooth form and (2) makes it possible\nto maintain the developed tooth geometry during production with greater precision than was previously achievable.\nDuring inspection, each working surface of each spiral bevel gear tooth is\nprobed with the coordinate-measuring\nmachine. To obtain the three-dimensional coordinates, 45 points are used (see\nFigure 2). A matrix of error data is then\ngenerated by comparing the threedimensional map data on the actual surfaces with stored map data on nominal\nsurfaces, which are those of a master reference gear. The nominal-surface data\nare generated in advance by similar measurements on the reference master gear.\nAmong the data stored in the computer are the elements of a corrective or\nsensitivity matrix that expresses the relationships between changes in gear-tooth\nsurfaces and changes in machine-tool\nsettings. The computer multiplies the\nerror matrix by the corrective matrix to\nobtain changes in machine-tool settings\nto drive the error matrix toward zero.\nThus, the precision of the gear-tooth surfaces can be enhanced initially and thereafter maintained in iterative cycles of\ngrinding, measurement, and adjustment\nof machine-tool settings.\nThis work was done by Harold Frint\n(deceased) and Warren Glasow of United\nTechnologies Corp. for Lewis Research\nCenter.

These forceps would replace conventional steel\nobstetrical forceps , which can cause\ninjury because they are rigid and\nunyielding and provide no means for\nmeasuring and limiting the forces\napplied to the infants\' heads.\nThe improved forceps would be fabricated mostly of thermoplastic material. Reinforcing fibers could be added in\nthe hinge region of the forceps . The\ncombination of material, size, and\nshape would be chosen to make the\nforceps yield elastically by an amount\nthat would keep the applied force from\nrising beyond a maximum allowable\nvalue. Fiber-optic sensors for measuring strains would be embedded in the\nforceps. The strain measurements\nwould be used to compute the tensile\nand compressive forces applied to an\ninfant\'s head.\nThe sensing mechanism for the fiberoptic sensors would be a Fiber-Braggtype reflection grating. These gratings\nwould be written holographically using\ninterfering beams of UV laser on the\ncore of the optical fiber at the designated sensing location. The wavelength of\nBragg reflection in each sensor would\nvary with the spatial period and with the\nspatially varying index of refraction of\nthe grating and would thus be indicative of the combined effects of thermal\nexpansion and strain.\nTo enable the computational separation of the effects of temperature from\nthe effects of the applied forces, it may\nbe necessary to use two grating elements for each force to be measured.\nOne of them would be positioned and\noriented so as not to be strained and\nwould thus provide a measure of temperature only. The strain reading of the\nother one could then be corrected for\ntemperature to obtain a pure strain\n(and, hence, force) reading.\nThe thermoplastic material and\ndimensions would be chosen to allow\nrelatively large displacement of the\nhead-gripping tips of the forceps with-\n\n84\n\nAbout 15 in.\n\nTOP VIEW\n\nSIDE VIEW\n\nThe Thermoplastic Obstetrical Forceps would limit and measure the forces applied to an\ninfant\'s head .\nout incurring permanent deformation of\nthe forceps. This design provision\nwould ensure that, as the forceps\ncame into contact with the infant\'s\nhead, the arms of the forceps would\nbegin to deform and would continue to\ndeform until the handles were pressed\nagainst each other. Forceps could be\ndesigned with cross sections tailored\nto different sizes of infants\' heads.\nSince most thermoplastic materials are\nViscoelastic, calibration of each forceps would be necessary before each\nuse. If forceps were made of a clear\nthermoplastic, then measurements of\nthe photoelastic effect could be used\nto determine fatigue of the plastic\nmaterial.

The\ntrend to automate fusion welding\nprocesses has also led to expanded use\nof lasers, as computers are installed to\nimprove product quality through more\nprecise manufacturing control.\nLaser beam welding is ideally suited for\nautomation, since the beam can be precisely positioned with optical elements\nlocated away from the fusion zone. In\naddition, fiber optics are now capable of\ntransmitting kilowatts of laser power and\nare used to carry the laser beam to the\nend of robotic welding arms.\nLaser beam welding differs most significantly from traditional electric-arc\nwelding processes in the mode of energy transfer. Unlike electric-arc energy\ntransfer, laser energy absorption by a\nmaterial is strongly affected by many factors, including the type of laser, the incident power density, and the base metal\'s\nreflectivity and surface condition.\nTwo important figures of merit to\nhelp characterize laser welding are the\nenergy transfer efficiency and the melting efficiency. Energy transfer efficiency\nis the ratio of the heat absorbed by the\nworkpiece to the incident laser energy.\nMelting efficiency is the ratio of the\nheat necessary to just melt the fusion\nzone to the heat absorbed by the\nworkpiece. Thus energy transfer efficiency indicates how much of the\nlaser\'s energy is absorbed by the part,\nand melting efficiency indicates how\neffectively that absorbed energy is\nused to produce melting .\nBoth efficiencies are extremely important in manufacturing, and both require\nan accurate determination of the heat\ninput to the part to be made. Since measurements of heat input to the workpiece\nare difficult, there has been widespread\nconfusion and lack of agreement in the\nwelding community as to the magnitude\nof these two efficiencies. This lack of\n4a\n\nunderstanding among laser users has\nled to unsubstantiated claims about the\nhigh melting efficiency of the laser beam\nwelding process. Lasers are often\nbelieved to be superior to other welding\nprocesses and to have performance\ncharacteristics that are exceptional.\nAt Sandia National Laboratories in\nAlbuquerque, NM, the laser beam welding process has been modeled and\nstudied extensively in recent years\nbecause of its importance in joining\nhigh-value preciSion components that\nrequire superior levels of quality.\nKnowing the heat input has been particularly important at Sandia because welding applications in the Department of\nEnergy\'s weapons complex require the\nselection of welding processes to minimize heat input to the workpiece and to\nreduce distortion and thermal damage to\nheat -sensitive components.\nTo understand the laser beam welding\nprocess and to help quantify these efficiencies, Sandia researchers have made\n\nextensive measurements of the net heat\ninput to the workpiece through the use\nof a Seebeck envelope calorimeter (see\nFigure 1). In experiments using a carbon\ndioxide laser to weld 304 stainless steel,\nthey have found that the energy transfer\nefficiency for laser beam welding can\nvary over a range of 20-90 percent,\ndepending primarily on the incident\nlaser-beam irradiance. These results as\nshown in Figure 2 also indicate that the\nenergy transfer efficiency reaches a high\nand approximately constant value at an\nincident beam irradiance of about 4.0\nMW/cm2. The figure also shows that the\ndepth of weld penetration can be varied\nwhile still maintaining high levels of energy transfer efficiency.\n\nFor manufacturing engineers these\nresults provide new insight into the laser\nwelding process.

For\nexample, one can select a range of\nprocess parameters that will make transfer\nefficiency invariant and thereby assure that\nuncontrolled changes in the laser\'s spot\nsize do not result in either an increase or a\ndecrease in the absorbed power.\nIt is not uncommon for welding engineers to develop weld schedules in\nwhich the incident laser beam is defocused. This situation leads to the reflection of a high fraction of the beam power.\nIn a pulsed Nd:YAG laser application at\none of Sandia\'s laser welding vendors,\nthe negative consequences of defocusing were dramatically demonstrated\nwhen a change in the production fixture\ntooling led to unapparent but catastrophic drilling of many expensive components. Clearly if one can operate in the\nplateau region of Figure 2 a more robust\nwelding process can be assured.\nThe Sandia team has also learned a\ngreat deal about the laser\'s ability to\nminimize heat input during welding .\nThey have found that the weld \'s process\nvariables and joint geometry can dramatically affect the melting efficiency\nand that all fusion welding processes\ncan be optimized to produce the same\nmaximum melting efficiency. The laser\nreally possesses no intrinsic advantage\nfor high melting efficiency. It is apparent\nfrom the Sandia research that the primary advantage of the laser process in\nminimizing heat input to the part stems\nfrom its ability to make very small or\nespecially deep welds that cannot be\nmade with other processes.\n\nmate melting efficiency. The straightforward mathematical relationship between\nthese parameters can be used to quickly estimate the heat input to the part\nbased on the size of the weld or for other\noptimization tasks such as selecting levels of travel speed and heat- source\npower that will reduce thermal damage\nto the weldment.\nFor the applications engineer to decide\non the cost -effectiveness of the laser\nbeam welding process , the model can be\nused to examine important processing\ndetails and to determine the ultimate\ncapabilities of a specific laser before it is\npurchased. To determine the required\nfunctional characteristics of the laser for\nan application, one must consider the\nproduction feed rates to be obtained, the\nsize of the fusion zone to be melted, the\nthermal properties of the materials, and\nthe process efficiencies.

Variation of measured energy transfer and weld penetration with beam irradiance for carbon dioxide laser welds on 304 stainless steel.\n5a\n\nhe Story of a small Saginaw, Michigan,\ncompany called Special Welding Services\n(SWS) has a point to make about moving\nfrom the limited sphere of aero pace specialization into the larger commercial arena. Ir\nwas a transition made possible by the rapidly\ngrowing maturiry of laser technology in the\npast decade, augmented by the foresight and\nresourcefulness of SWS\'s staff.\nSWS gOt its stan in 1967, when its principal line of busines was to weld fuel-injector\nnozzles for jet engines. At that time elecuonbeam (E-beam) welding was the only technology that could provide the high quality\nthat the aerospace and defense industries\nrequired. But by the same token the process\nwas so expensive and rime-conswning that it\nwas self-limiting.\nSoon, according to Jay Morley, president of\nSWS, the company (then called Advanced\nTechnologies [nc.) began looking for ways to\nexpand its business apart from E-beam welding. It moved into building custom machine\ntools and fabricating equipment. In 1984, the\nwelding and the fabrication functions separated. With the E-beam market sufficiently\nstrong to suppOrt the company, SWS was on\nItS own.\nThese years saw increasing aerospace\nengine and airframe orders and newly developed medical implants, both sectors using\nexotic stainless and titanium alloys. Yet the\nnext impetus for expansion carne ftom a different, if not entirely unexpected, direction.\nThe automotive industry, SWS\'s gargantuan\nMichigan neighbor, began experimenting\nwith ways to reduce vehicle size and weight,\nand SWS took on many prototype E-beam\nwelding jobs.\nBut, Morley says, "we realized that costs and\nprocessing time of that technology would be\nprohibitive to any production volume the\nautomotive industry would consider normal."\nIn 1991 SWS began to look closely at the laser.\n\nT\n\nA Solution Close to Home\nCoincidentally, an auto plant nearby was\noffering two decommissioned Rofin-Sinar\nRS-975 5-kilowarr carbon dioxide lasers for\nsale. According to Morley, "We looked, we\nbought, and our entry into laser welding\nbegan." Though the task of rebuilding the\naging and neglected equipment was considerable, SWS could fall back on its experience in\nbuilding special machines. They found technical support and the spare pans they needed\nat Rofin-Sinar\'s Plymouth, MI, plant, JUSt\ntwO hours\' drive away. Though the power\nsupplies and peripherals such as wiring had to\nbe completely overhauled, the laser resonator\nand its optics were still in good shape, Morley\nsays. A new computer-numerical control unit\nwas added to the systems to bring them into\nthe nineties. The first laser was up and running by early 1992.\nSWS constructed a laser lab within its\nplant, purring the operating unit and the\n6a\n\nBRIDGING THE\n\nGAP\nFor one small company,\nthe laser led the way from\naerospace specialization\nto a host of commercial\napplications.\n\npower supply on the roof above the lab.\nMirrors deliver the beam to the welding\nworkstation below, where the conuol unit is\nalso located. The workstation\'s X-Y-Z table\nhas tooling to add a rotational axis when\nrequired.\nMorley and his colleagues were pleased\nwith the results of the first few jobs with the\nlaser. Though the E-beam continues to deliver the highesr-qualiry weld needed for\ndemanding aerospace applications, he points\nOut that the laser is also a high-energy-density technique, and that quality is not substantially inferior. Moreover, the laser can do\nmany jobs two to three times faster or more\nthan the older technique previously used.\nOne example is a tubular part used in a\npower tool for the construction industry.\nInternal machining requirements dictated\nthat the 7 -inch barrel be constructed from\ntwo pieces welded together. The assembly was\nto be reciprocating within bearing surfaces, so\nrunout between the two ends had to be within 0.005 in. total indicated reading, and critical machined features radially located within\na \xc2\xb1 10 tolerance. Both the E-beam and the\nlaser system could meet the requirements.\nBut the crucial difference emerges in the\n\nOne of SWS\'s refurbished Rofin-Sinar lasers selectively hardens the ball-rajl tracks used in ATM banking machines. The narrow and depth-controlled\nheat-affected zone makes straightening easy and\ncrack-free.\n\nspeed of the two competing techniques. The\ncarbon dioxide laser can weld three barrels per\nminute. By conuast, using the E-beam means\nthat the welding must be done in a lead-lined\nchamber of limited size and in a 1 X 10-4 Torr\nvacuum. Taking time for loading and vacuum\npumping into account, the E-beam can deliver only one barrel every five minutes.\nUsing the laser, Morley calculates, cuts\nCOSts by a factor of 20. With a projecred\n150,000 units a year, the saving is substantial.\nOther jobs the laser can do include transmission prototype components and production\nparts, as a backup for auto companies\' own production capabilities. SWS also laser-welds a ball\nvalve part in yearly quantities of 400,000. In\nanother laser application, the company heatueats the bearing-surface area of ball rails used\nin the sliding mechanism of ATMs. The laser\'s\nability to limit the heat-affected wne means\nlocalizing the hardening to the predefmed area\nand depth, so the rails can be easily straightened\nwithout cracking or breaking.\n\nA Distinct Advantage\nLast year SWS added a 500-W Rofm-Sinar\nRSY 500P Nd:YAG laser to its welding\nmachine shop. This system has one distinct\nadvantage ov::r carbon dioxide lasers: the ability to deliver the beam via fiber optics, which\nincrease flexibility of delivery and improve\ncontrol over energy density at the weld site.\nExcept for some short-run prototype work,\nSWS is currently using the Nd:YAG laser\nalmost exclusively for welding orthoscopic\nneedles. Surgeons use these needles, about a\nquarter-inch in diameter, to penetrate bones\nduring surgery. Welding is needed because the\ninsuument is made of two dissimilar materials, an austenitic stainless-steel hollow shaft\nand a hardened martensitic stainless tip.\nMorley points out that SWS averages 350\nneedle assemblies per hour with the laser,\nabout three and half times the number with\nthe E-beam. With a projected 300,000 units\nper year, one laser suffices-with time left\nover for other jobs-whereas one E-beam\ncould not meet this requirement.\nMorley points Out that the refurbished\nlasers have a record of 95 percent up-time, in\nspite of being more than a decade old. SWS\nhas grown tenfold since 1984, when it split\noff as exclusively a welding shop. As he investigates new laser technology, Morley expeCts\neven more rapid growth in the future.\n"We do different things with the lasers\nevery day," he observes. "I am constantly\namazed at the range and diversity of the laser\'s\napplications. I\'m like a kid in a toy shop.\n"We do a lot of development work, even\nfor our competition in the laser business, who\nthen take it into production. But we are\nrapidly getting to the point that we can handle all production runs. We plan to increase\nour floor space by about 28,000 square feet\nwithin five years," Morley says, "and 20,000\nof that will house lasers."\nJ UNE\n\n1995\n\nStirling Coolers\nFully integrated detector/cooler\nassemblies for 77\xc2\xb0 Kelvin\noperation are now available in\nproduction quantities.

The method yields highly\naccurate measurements of deformation\nin a variety of materials, and is especially useful in studying complex, anisotropic structures. With the newly developed\nINEL moire hardware, it is now possible\nto perform such measurements in the\nfield for nondestructive testing and lifetime fatigue estimates. An area with\ngreat potential is such a system to monitor the mechanical condition of critical\ncomponents of large structures such as\nbridges, tanks, piping, aircraft components (struts, wing assemblies, etc.),\npressure vessels, submarine hulls, or\nother components with high risk factors.\nThe series of diffraction moire interferometers developed at INEL used\nadvanced fiber optic devices to greatly\nsimplify the design and utilization of the\nsystems. They range from briefcase size\nto a handheld unit, and all incorporate the\nlatest advances in automated phase-shifting data acquisition and analysis. Every\neffort has been made to reduce the complexity of the equipment, of its operation,\nand of the data analysis, and to improve\nthe stability of the system. This is in sharp\ncontrast to the more conventional moire\napparatus, which utilized complex discrete optical and mechanical components\nand hand analysis of the data.\nThe portable moire interferometer is a\ncompact, fully featured device suitable\nfor most deformation research needs. It\ncan be configured for uniaxial or biaxial\ndistortion measurements, with a resolution of 10 nm (equivalent to 5 microstrain over a 50-mm sample). It is possible to adapt the system for less sensitivity if large deformation is expected.\nThe handheld moire interferometer\nhas fixed sensitivity, and is uniaxial (biaxial displacements can be recorded in\ntwo successive measurements), but\nretains the resolution of the portable\nsystem with even simpler operating\nrequirements .

These detectors\nwould compete with such other ultraviolet\ndetectors as charge-coupled devices\n(which are not solar-blind and are vulnerable to ionizing radiation) and photocathodes with multichannel-plate amplifiers\n(which involve several disadvantages and\ncomplications, including recovery times\nlonger than 1 ~s and the need for highvoltage power supplies).\nThe principal ferroelectric materials\nunder consideration for use in these devices are perovskite titanates (lead zirconate titanate, strontium titanate, and\nbarium titanate), which feature gaps of 3 to\n4 eV between the valence and conduction\nelectron-energy bands (energy "bandgap")\nand which are relatively invulnerable to ionizing radiation. Ferroelectric ultraviolet\ndetectors offer additional advantages of\nresponse times::;; 1 ns, no need for highvoltage power supplies, low power consumption (power needed only by the\nassociated sensing circuits), operation at\nroom temperature, and availability of fabrication technology to incorporate them into silicon-based integrated circuits to form\ncompact, lightweight arrays of detectors\nand sensing circuitry.\nHeretofore, the high-speed photoeffects\nof ferroelectric capacitors have been considered as the basis for nondestructive\noptoelectronic readout of the contents of\nferroelectric memory devices, as described\nin "Optically Addressable, Ferroelectric\nMemory With NDRO" (NPO-18573), NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 18 No.3, (March 1994),\npage 32 and "Rapid, Nondestructive\nReadout From Ferroelectric Memory"\n(NPO-18551), Laser Tech Briefs, Vol. 1 No.\n1, (September 1993), page 28.

Therefore, it has been proposed that\nto take better advantage of the photovoltaic effect for detecting ultraviolet photons, the device should be fabricated with\n\nSemltranspatent Top Electrode\n\na dominant Schottky junction at the illuminated interface (see Figure 2) so that the\nelectric field in the device would separate\nthe photogenerated charge carriers more\nefficiently, allowing less recombination\ntime.

The spatial filter\nincludes a pinhole that can be moved\nalong the x and y axes (which are perpendicular to the optical axis) and a lens that\ncan be moved along the z axis (the optical\naxis, nominally coincident with the axis of\nthe laser beam). The control system imitates the actions of a human technician in\nperforming the x, y, and z adjustments.\nA fuzzy-logic controller was chosen for\nthis task, instead of a neural-network\ncontroller, primarily because a fuzzy-logic\ncontroller is cheaper and, in the particular\napplication , can be set up and operated\nwith less preparation and less computational overhead. Fortuitously, a human\ntechnician\'s actions in adjusting a spatial\nfilter can be described by a set of fuzzy\nrules. In addition, fuzzy-logic Circuitry can\nflexibly accept inputs and produce outputs in data formats compatible with\nthose of the rest of the system.\nThe immediate purpose of the adjustments is to maximize the intensity of the\nspot of light formed by projecting the\nlaser beam onto a translucent target,\neliminate diffraction rings in the spot, and\ncenter the spot on the optical axis. To\nquantify the spot of light for processing\ninto adjustment control signals, a video\nimage of the spot is digitized to as many\nas 6 bits in each pixel in an array of 128\nx 116 pixels. Then , operating at the video\nframe rate by processing the digitized\n\nCharge-CoupledDevice\nVideo Camera\n\nFuzzy-Logic\nPattern\nGenerator\n\nI\n\n1\n\nimage data from all the pixels simultaneously on parallel paths, the system compares the digitized image with each of five\nstored reference patterns.\nThe arithmetic result of the com par isons is a Euclidean or Hamming distance between the digitized image and\neach reference pattern. An increase in\nsuch a distance measure can be regarded , in fuzzy logic, as an indication of\ndecreasing strength of membership of\nthe image in the set of images represented by the reference pattern. Using a total\nof 49 fuzzy-logic rules that formalize the\nrelationships between these distance\nmeasures and light-spot intensity distributions of various degrees and kinds of\nmisalignment, the control computer\nissues adjustment control signals to three\nmotor drives that effect the x, y, and z\nadjustments of the spatial filter.\nIn a test of the system, the pinhole and\nlens were purposely misaligned, but the\nresulting spot was kept within the view of\nthe video camera. With the motor speeds\nused, the system took about 15 seconds\nto restore alignrnent in typical cases. The\nresu lts achieved by the system were\njudged "good" by a skilled technician\naccustomed to performing manual alignment of the laser beam .\nThis work was done by M.

The method\nwould involve a selective, timed combination of optical wavefront phase conjugation and amplification to regenerate\nimages in real time to compensate for\nlosses in optical iteration loops; the timing would be such that the amplification\nwould be turned on to regenerate the\ndesired image, then turned off so as not\nto regenerate other, undesired images or\nspurious light propagating through the\nloops from unwanted reflections.\nFigure 1 schematically illustrates an\niterative rotation processor of the type\ndescribed above, but without amplification according to the proposed method.\nIn principle, the input image could be\nrotated iteratively, in small increments,\nthrough a full circle by repeated passes\nthrough two suitably aligned mirror\ntransform modules. In practice, amplification would be needed to overcome\nthe optical loss on each pass, thereby\nretaining enough optical power to query\nall angles of interest.\nThe top part of Figure 2 schematically\nillustrates two alternative regeneration\nschemes , while the bottom part of\nFigure 2 shows the configuration of a\nrotation processor containing regenerator units according to this method. In\neither scheme, the affected beam of\nlight would be reflected into one end of\na multi mode optical fiber that would be\nlong enough (typically ~ 1 km) to introduce enough delay (several tens of\nmicroseconds) to facilitate timing control\nfor switching amplification on and off\n(with typical switching times of the order\nof 1 J..Is and perhaps eventually less).\nSuch delays (denoted \'t1 and \'t2 in\nFigure 2) would also be chosen much\nlonger than the delay, \'to along the freespace segments of the optical path.\nIn one of these schemes, both amplifi12a\n\nBeam Carrying Input Image\nVanderlugt\nCorrelator\n\nIterative Rotation\nMirror2\nMirror\nTransform\nAcross\ny \' Axis\n\nCorrelator\nOutput\n{\n\nBeam Carrying Fourier\nTransform of\nReference Image\n\nComer Reflector 2\ny\n\nMirror Transform Across y Axis\n\nFigure 1.

The polaradiometric pyrometer\nwould include a polarimetric photometer\nor radiometer and a lamp that emits light\nof spectral intensity ILAMP at wavelength A.\nILAMPwould be both measurable and controllable. The instruments would be\narranged so that lamp light reflected from\nthe specimen would enter the polarimetric photometer along with thermal radiation emitted by the specimen (see figure).\nThe principle of operation of the\npolaradiometric pyrometer is based partlyon the simple equations for the relationships among the emissivities, the\nreflectivities, and the intensities of the\nvarious polarization components of light\nemitted by, and light reflected from, the\nspecimen. A straightforward derivation\nthat starts from these equations leads to\na simple criterion for determining the\nspectral intensity, Ib\' of radiation emitted\nby the specimen at wavelength A: The\neffects of the emissivities and reflectivities would balance each other in such a\nway that when Ib = ILAMP, the light that\nentered the polarimetric photometer\nwould be unpolarized (that is, the intensity of entering light polarized in the plane\nof incidence would equal the intensity of\nentering light polarized parallel to the\nplane of incidence). Thus, to determine Ib\nwithout having to measure the polarization-dependent emissivities or reflectivities of the specimen, it would suffice to\nadjust ILAMP until the desired un polarized\ncondition was obtained. One would then\nmeasure ILAMP \xe2\x80\xa2\nThen, using Ib = ILAMP and assuming\n\nthat the specimen emits black-body\nradiation, the absolute temperature,\nT, of the specimen could be computed\nby use of Planck\'s radiation law. The\ncustomary form of Planck\'s radiation\nlaw can be manipulated easiiy to obtain\nT = hc/ Akln[(2hc2/ILAMPA5) + 1], where h\nis Planck\'s constant, k is Boltzmann\'s\nconstant, and c is the speed of light in\na vacuum.\nThis work was done by Ali A.

One of\nthe most promising approaches to this\nproblem makes use of frequency upconversion in insulating solids.\nFrequency upconversion is a process\nin which the energy resident in two or\nmore infrared pump photons populates a\nhigh-lying energy level of a laser-active\nion. One-photon transitions to low-lying\nlevels then yield visible light. Many upconversion lasers based on doped optical\nfibers have produced output wavelengths\nranging from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet. But the greatest advantage offered\nby the optical fiber geometry is that room temperature operation is much easier to\nobtain than in the bulk-gain media more\nconventionally employed.\nThe visible upconversion laser\ndescribed here offers many unique characteristics that are attractive for many\napplications. For instance, the laser can\nbe pumped by a single GaAlAs laser\ndiode, and it produces tunable multicolor\nvisible output at room temperature. To\nthe knowledge of the researchers, their\n300-mW output power obtained at 635\nnm is the highest yet reported for roomtemperature operation of an upconversion laser. The combination of a laser\ndiode pump and an optical fiber gain\nmedium makes possible extremely compact packages suitable for a diversity of\nreal-world applications.\nThe experiments used two fiber-laser\ncavity configurations. In the first, dielectric mirrors are butted against the fiber\nends. One of these serves as a high\nreflector, the other as the output coupler.\nFor the sake of convenience, and to test\npump wavelength tunability, a tunable\nTi:Al 20 3 laser is used as a surrogate for a\ndiode-laser pump. A 20X microscope\nobjective focuses the pump light through\nthe high reflector onto the fiber end. The\nsecond configuration is similar to the first,\nexcept that a collimating ball lens and an\nintracavity prism interposed between the\noutput coupler and fiber end provide\nwavelength discrimination sharper than\nthat provided by the mirror coatings. The\nprism also makes possible fine tuning of\nthe output wavelength .\nThe laser-active medium is a ZBLAN\xc2\xae\n14a\n\nlaser wavelength\n\n635\n\n615\n\n520\n\n491\n\n(nm)\nthreshold(mW)\n\n42\n\n29\n\n21\n\n60\n\nsloj>e_efficiell9\'\n\n52%\n\n11.5%\n\n12.4 %\n\n3%\n\nmaximum output\n\n300mW\n\n44mW*\n\n20mW\n\n4mW\n\n(launcbed power)\n\n(760 mW)\n\n(430mW)\n\n(200mW)\n\n(200mW)\n\ncavity\n\nI\n\n2\n\nI\n\nI\n\nfiber length\n\n60\n\n60\n\n42\n\n26\n\noutput coupling\n\n96\n\n5\n\n3\n\n3\n\n635-637\n\n605-622\n\n517-540\n\n491-493\n\nconfiguration\n\n(% transmission)\ntuning range\xc2\xb7\n*cavity configuration 2.\n\nTable: Summary of Upconversion Fiber Laser Performance\n\nsingle-mode fiber doped with 3000 ppm\nby weight of Pr+ and 20,000 ppm by\nweight of Yb3+.

A variety of fiber lengths ranging from 20 cm to\n10m were used in order to investigate\nlaser operation.\nFor a fixed pump wavelength of 860\nnm, the performance of representative\nupconversion fiber lasers is summarized\nin the table. The threshold pump powers\nand slope efficiencies given in the table\nare determined with respect to the\nlaunched pump power, a quantity estimated in the experiments to be about\n\n40% of the pump power incident on the\ninput microscope objective.

The folded-resonator design used a single end-pumped Nd:YAG rod. Different\ndiode pump arrays were optically coupled to the rod using\neither lenses or optical fibers. The rod was held to approximately 25 0 C and the arrays to whatever temperature was\nrequired to maintain the 808-nm pump wavelength. A newly\ndesigned temperature feedback control loop allowed constant\nmonitoring and control of the laser diode\'s temperature.\nFigure 1 shows the resonator. A single rod 1 cm long by 0.8\ncm in diameter was used as an active mirror in an inverse Z resonator configuration. Resonator mode volume in the Nd:YAG\n3\nwas approximately 10 mm . The rod was HR-coated at 1064\nnm and AR-coated at 808 nm on the rear (pump) surface, and\nAR-coated at 1064 nm on the front surface. The end mirrors\n(M1 and M3) of the resonator were both HR-coated at 1064\nnm; the end mirror in the frequency-doubling leg (M3) was also\nHR-coated at 532 nm. The output coupler (M2) was HR-coated at 1064 nm on one surface and AR-coated at 532 nm on\nboth surfaces.\nThe inverse Z resonator design allows implementation of a\ntwo-rod configuration, as shown in Figure 2, where mirror M1 is\nreplaced by a second Nd:YAG crystal. Pumping of each rod\nwith a high-power laser diode results in scaling to higher powers while alleviating gain-media thermal loading. Previous experiments have explored similar multiple-rod (two or more) configurations. Three Nd:YAG rods were used in a Z resonator with\neach pumped by a 3-W SOL 2481-P1 diode. The resulting output was 2.2 W at 1064 nm in the TEMoo mode. The Air Force\nhas a patent pending on this multiple-rod design in both\nGermany and the United States.\nThe frequency-doubling crystal used in recent experiments by\nscientists at PULlDA\'s Semiconductor Laser Technology\nBranch was a single piece of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP)\n3 mm X 3 mm X 10 mm. The KTP was mounted in holder that\nallowed X-Y-Z translation, moderate X-V tilt, and 360 0 rotation\nabout the resonator (Z) axis. For these experiments, the KTP\ntemperature was not monitored or stabilized. Future experiments at higher optical power will require temperature stabilization of the KTP crystals.\nThe initial experiments used a beam-shaping train, conSisting\nof three cylindrical lenses and one spherical lens, to focus an\nSOL 3550-S 15-W CW laser diode array into the Nd:YAG crystal. Losses in the lens train were approximately 26 percent, and\n11 W of pump power were incident on the Nd:YAG rod surface;\nthe incident pump beam was elliptical and approximately 1 mm\nX 2 mm in cross section. The resonator, when optimized, emitted 1.05 W of 532-nm radiation with a moderately elliptical\nbeam shape.\nJUN E\n\n1995\n\nThe later experiments used an SOL 3550-P5 fiber-coupled\ndiode array that was first collimated with a Melles Griot 8-mm\nlens and then focused into the Nd:YAG rod with a 31.7-mm\nspherical lens. Both lenses were AR-coated at 830 nm. Losses\nin the fiber were approximately 33 percent, and 10 W of pump\npower were incident on the rod surface. The pump beam was\ncircular, and approximately 1 mm in cross section. When optimized, the resonator emitted 1.25 W of 532-nm radiation in the\nTEMoo mode.\nA prototype of the laser has been packaged into a volume of\nless than one cubic foot using off-the-shelf power supplies.

The\nprinCipal advantage is expected to be the\nability to make measurements through\nstratified and/or flowing gases, smoke,\nand flames, as well as through solid layers of x-ray-transparent materials.\nThe use of x rays as a medium of\nmeasurement overcomes the obvious\ndisadvantages of contact measurement\ntechniques in hostile environments.\nFurthermore, while radiation at optical\nwavelengths can be severely refracted\nby stratified and/or flowing gases and\ncan be severely attenuated by smoke, x\nrays penetrate smoke easily and are\nhardly refracted.\nThe x rays chosen for use in this\nmethod are at the low end of the hardx-ray spectrum; this choice represents\na compromise between the need for\nthe penetrating ability and low refractivity of higher-energy photons and the\nneed to minimize the radiation hazard\nposed by high-energy photons. The\n18a\n\nmost commonly available sources of\nthis kind of radiation are x-ray-diffraction tubes that either contain copper filaments and emit radiation at a characteristic wavelength of 1.5 A or else contain molybdenum filaments and emit at\n\na wavelength of 0.7 A.\nFigure 1 schematically illustrates the\nbasic principle of the method.

This, or a similar\napparatus, is generally well suited for\nmeasuring fast (typical speeds 160 to 700\nm/s) , highly turbulent gas flows in turbomachinery. Other potential applications\ninclude measurement of gas flows in\npipelines and in flows from explosions.\nAs its name suggests, this apparatus\nmeasures the times of flight of small\n"seed" particles entrained in the flow\nbetween laser-light spots. The component of velocity along the line between the\nspots can then be computed as the distance between the spots divided by the\ntime of flight. The design of this apparatus\nincorporates those features of two older\nlaser-anemometer designs that are particularly desirable for measuring the highly\nturbulent flows in the narrow passages of\nturbomachines. The features in question\nare (1) the large acceptance angles of\nfringe anemometers (attractive for use in\nturbulent flows) and (2) the small illuminated probe volumes and the consequent\nspatial selectivity and sensitivity to small\nparticles of time-of-flight anemometers\n(suitable for measurements near walls).\ntwo-color,\nfour-spot\nlaser\nThe\n20a\n\nanemometer nominally measures a single\ncomponent of velocity along a line\nbetween the two pairs of overlapping\nelliptical spots (see figure). Actually, it\nmeasures velocities within an acceptance\nangle (about \xc2\xb1300) defined by the spot\ngeometry. The spots in each pair differ in\nboth color and in polarization: The use of\ntwo colors increases the light flux in the\nmeasurement volume and enables better\ndiscrimination against cross-talk in the\n\nassociated photodetection equipment\ndescribed below.

The pairs of orthogonally polarized,\noverlapping spots are then generated by a quarter-wave plate followed by a Wollaston prism.\nThe light scattered from particles that traverse the spots is separated by color, collected by a lens, discriminated further by polarization, and directed onto four photomultiplier tubes, such that the\noutput of each tube indicates the light scattered from one of the\nfour spots. The overlap between the spots in each pair is chosen\nso that the light scattered from the transit of a given particle across\nall four spots results in two pairs of electronic pulses, the pulses in\neach pair overlapping by half the duration of one pulse. The overlapping pulses are subtracted electronically to obtain two bipolar\npulses. The time between the zero crossings of the two bipolar\npulses nominally equals the time of flight of the particle between\nthe centroids of the pairs of spots. The fixed overlap of the spots\nresults in a set of pulses that are optimally delayed, independently of velocity.\nTo obtain two-dimensional velocity information, the measurement volume is rotated to a selected number of orientations by\nuse of a mirrored Dove-prism image rotator. At each orientation,\nmeasurements are taken and processed into a probability-density function of velocity. Then the probability-density functions from\nthe various orientations are used to compute the magnitude and\nangle of an average velocity vector.\nThis work was done by Mark P.

The concept of\noptrodes was also described in\n"Ethylene-Vapor Optrodes" (KSC11579), Laser Tech Briefs, Vol. 1, No.1\n(September 1993), page 55.\nThe basic sensing unit in this system\nis a porous optical fiber, about 0.5 cm\nlong and 250 mm in diameter, in which\na pH-sensitive chromophoric reagent\n("the indicator" for short) is immobilized.\nThe indicator is bonded into the network of molecules in the fiber by mixing\nit into the monomeric solution that is\nsubsequently polymerized to make the\nfiber. The monomeric solution also contains a solvent, which is evaporated\nfrom the fiber after polymerization to\nleave behind a network of interconnected pores. The fiber thus fabricated is\nmounted in a sensor head (see figure)\nand connected via lead-in and lead-out\nplastic optical fibers to optoelectronic\ninterface equipment. A desktop computer connected to the interface equipment controls the system and processes the sensory data.\nIn operation, the senSing head is\nimmersed in the solution, which enters\nthe pores. The large surface area of the\npores promotes contact between the\nsolution and the indicator. Light from\nred and green light-emitting diodes is\ncoupled into the sensor through the\nlead-in optical fiber, while the light that\npasses through the sensor is coupled\nvia the lead-out optical fiber to photodetectors. The absorption of green\nlight in the indicator varies with the\npH of the solution in contact with it,\nwhile the absorption of red light\nremains constant.\nDetecting and sampling circuits measure the ratio of red and green light\ngoing into the lead-in fiber and coming\nout of the lead-out fiber. From these\nlevels, the computer determines the\ndegree of absorption of green light and,\nthus, the pH of the solution. The system can measure pH with full reversibility in the range from 3.5 to 8.0, with a\nresolution of 0.01 and an accuracy of\n0.1. It responds to a full-range step\nincrement of pH in less than 1 min.\nThis work was done by Mary Beth\nTabacco and Quan Zhou of GeoCenters, Inc., for Kennedy Space\nCenter.

As in some other stereoscopic systems, the\nobserver wears shuttered goggles synchronized with alternating left- and right-eye views on a display. However, instead of\nlooking directly at the display screen, the observer looks at the\nscreen via reflection in a mirror that collimates the light emitted\nby the screen.\nThis configuration is based on a finding, from psychophysical experiments, that the range of apparent depth in stereopsis increases with the distance between the screen and the\nviewer. Unfortunately, increasing the distance also narrows the\nfield of view. Collimation can provide an optical effect equivalent to that of an increase in distance, without narrowing the\nfield of view. This depth increase occurs apparently because\ncollimation moves the accommodation distance of the eyes to\ninfinity instead of the typical distance of about a meter\nbetween the eyes and a display screen, while still allowing the\nlines of sight of the eyes to converge on closer objects. Thus,\na stereoscopic display system that includes collimation provides depth cues over the full range of stereoscopic vision.\nA preliminary experiment to test the configuration was performed on the apparatus shown schematically in the figure.\nThis apparatus was constructed by adding a stereoscopic display unit to a spherical mirror (the collimator) and beam splitter\nsubassembly from an aircraft cockpit simulator windowing\nsystem. The apparatus was improvised hastily, without enough\ntime to optimize the optical configuration. Nevertheless, the\nresults of the experiment demonstrated hundredfold increases\nin the range of perceived depths, enabling the observer to perceive objects at distances as small as a few inches or as large\nas several hundred feet.\nThis work was done by Anthony M. Busquets, Russell V.\nParrish, and Steven P.

Each pixel of such\nan array would comprise a photodetector monolithically integrated with a JFET\noutput-amplifier circuit of the source-follower type - a structure similar to that of\na charge-coupled device (CCO).\nThe figure illustrates schematically the\nstructure and operation of an element of\nthe array. The isolation gate would electrically isolate this element from adjacent\npixels. The photog ate would be the optically active region of the device, wherein\nelectrons from optically excited electronlhole pairs would be stored temporarily during integration periods. For\nreadout, a change in the potential applied\nto the transfer gate would allow the\ncharge accumulated under the photogate to flow to the low-capacitance collector, which would be connected to the\ngate of the source-follower JFET. The\n\nscreen gate would suppress capacitive\nfeedthrough from the transfer gate to the\ncollector. The source follower would\nbuffer the output signal and provide it to\na column bus selected by a switching\nsignal applied to another JFET.\nEach active pixel device would exhibit\nlow readout-node capacitance like that\nof a CCO array but without the chargetransfer difficulties inherent in a CCO. The\narray would feature front illumination for\nenhanced response to shorter wavelengths. In comparison with older\ninfrared-imaging devices, these devices\nwould offer the advantages of substantial\nreductions of readout noise, with consequent elimination of the need for large,\npower-consuming mechanical coolers .\nThe reduction in the cooling requirement\nwould simplify development of miniature\ninstruments for visible and infrared wavelengths. Readout circuitry could be less\ncomplex while providing random access\nto any element of an array.\nIn addition, monolithic arrays of these\ndevices would offer several advantages\nover hybrid arrays. The size of an array\n\nwould no longer be limited by considerations of differential thermal expansion\nbetween the array and a silicon readoutcircuit Chip. All of the processing needed\nto mate the array with the readout circuitry would be eliminated. Monolithic\nInGaAs sensor arrays with sizes comparable to those of silicon CCOs would be\nfeasible. The cost of a monolithic InGaAs\nsensor array should be substantially less\nthan that of an equivalent hybrid array\ncontaining HgCdTe photodetectors.\nThis work was done by Eric R.\nFossum, Thomas J.

This\ndevice is a prototype of a gas-pressure sensor for an aircraft\nengine. It can be mounted in the engine at or near the desired\nmeasurement point, where it can respond to both the timevarying and the steady components of pressure. In contrast,\nolder pressure sensors based on strain-gauge transducers\ncannot withstand typical engine temperatures and must\ntherefore be mounted in cooler surroundings and connected\nto the measurement points via long tubes, which distort the\ntime-varying components of the pressure signals.\nThe photoelastic sensing element resembles an inverted\ncup and is made of fused silica. In the manner in which it is\nmounted in the sensor head and stressed by the pressure to\nbe measured, the element is approximately functionally\nequivalent to a thick diaphragm. By virtue of the photoelastic\neffect, the sensing element becomes birefringent to a degree\nproportional to the stress. To measure the stress-induced\nbirefringence and thus the pressure, a small projecting portion of the sensing element with polished surfaces is interrogated with polarized light.\nThe source of light is a light-emitting diode, which is pulsed\nat a rate of 10kHz and emits at a wavelength of 840 nm.

The collimated polarized\nlight passes through the protruding portion of the sensing element, then\nthrough\nanother\nfused-silica\nw indow/lens, then through another\ncrystal prism polarizer. This second\nprism polarizer splits the outgoing light\ninto two beams: (1) a transmitted beam,\nin which the polarization is perpendicu lar to that of the original polarization,\nand (2) a reflected (also called "reference") beam, in which the polarization\nis parallel to the original polarization.\nEach of these beams is focused onto\nthe end of a fiber-optic cable, which\ncarries it to photodetectors.\nThe outputs of the photodetectors are\namplified, processed to obtain ac and\ndc components, digitized, multiplexed,\nand processed by a desktop computer.\nBy use of pulsed operation and separation of ac and dc components , it is possible to correct for dc background signals that are independent of the desired\nsensor signals.\n.\nIn principle, the outputs I, and 1 of\n3\nphotodetectors 1 and 3 are the ac components that represent the intensities of\nthe cross-polarized (transmitted) and\ncopolarized (reflected) beams, respectively.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nSpatial light modulators (SLMs) of a\nproposed type would provide independent control over both the phase and the\namplitude of the electromagnetic field of\nthe modulated light. In the polar representation of electromagnetic-field quantities\nthat vary sinusoidally with time, this would\nbe characterized as providing full control\nover the complex amplitude. The proposed SLMs would thus be useful in optical processing of information (e.g., by use\nof an optical correlator). in which it is\nessential to control complex amplitude as\na function of time and of poSition in a correlation plane. In contrast, most practical\nSLMs now in use effect certain combinations of amplitude and phase in their\nmodulations but cannot control amplitude\nand phase independently.\nA typical conventional SLM either comprises a square array of electrically\naddressed modulating picture elements\n(pixels) or else is optically addressable at a\ncontinuum of locations. The action of the\nelectrically addressed pixel or optically\naddressed spot is restricted to a characteristic string of locations (its operating\ncurve); e.g., a curve of complex amplitude\nvs. applied voltage.\nAn SLM of the proposed type would\ncomprise two conventional SLMs and a\nbeam splitter arranged to place the virtual\nlocations of the SLMs in optical conjunction: the SLMs would be positioned relative to the beam splitter so that an observer would perceive them to coincide at the\nlocation of the one in the direct line of sight\nthrough the beam splitter (see figure).\nIndependent modulating signals would be\napplied to the two SLMs and their optical\nresponses would be added and superimposed via this optical conjunction.\nOne could thus take advantage of\nsimultaneously modulating at different\nIncident Light\n~\n\nBeam\n\nSplitter\n\n~~\nSpetial\nLight Modulators\n\nTwo Spatial Light Modulators would be\narranged with a beam splitter so that they\nappear to coincide and would be modulated\nindependently to reach points of the complex-amplitude plane that are inaccessible via\none spatial light modulator alone.\nl u E 1995\n\npoints on the operating curves of the two\nSLMs. The two SLMs could have identical\nor different operating curves; for example,\neither could have a spiral curve or a\nstraight curve at some angle with respect\nto the real axis. This approach would provide access to a two-dimensional range\nof complex amplitudes that are inaccessible when only one conventional SLM is\nused. By suitable design, this range\nwould be made wide enough in both the\nreal and imaginary dimensions to enable\n\nfull complex-amplitude control over the\nlight traveling toward the observer.\nThis wak was done by Richard O.

A DAL is a suppressed-carrier data-communication\nradio-receiver subsystem that uses\npower in the sidebands (corresponding\nto the data modulation) to enhance\ntracking of the carrier or subcarrier frequency. A digital DAL is said to be of\nsecond order when the z-transform\ntransfer function of a filter in the loop is\nof the form F(z) = A 1 + A/(z-1). The\nreport begins with a description of a digital DAL and of the results of a previous\nstudy of a second-order analog DAL. To\nenable utilization of the results of that\nstudy, the Laplace-transform transfer\nfunction of the corresponding digital DAL\nis derived. Both the exact z-transform\ntransfer function of the analog loop filter\nand a linear-interpolation method are\nused in approximating the Laplace\ntransform of the transfer function of the\nsecond-order digital filter. A mathematical model of the tracking phase jitter of\nthe second-order digital DAL is derived\nby use of this approximation. Next, the\neffect of the tracking phase jitter on the\nbit-error-rate performance is investigated by computer simulation, using design\nparameters for deep-space communication systems.\nThis work was done by Tien M.\nNguyen of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The results of the simulations are\ncompared with experimental data in\nsome cases. This is one of many studies directed toward understanding the\naerodynamic behavior and enhancing\nthe maneuverability of fighter airplanes\nequipped with such wings.These studies also have implications for gas\npumps and turbines, in which flows\nnear the tips of vanes and blades can\nreach supersonic speeds.\nThe flow of air about a wing is represented in this study by the thin-layer\nversion of the Navier-Stokes equations\nin strong-conservation-Iaw form. The\nequations of aeroelastic motion of the\nwing are obtained by use of the\nRayleigh-Ritz method, in which the\naeroelastic displacements as functions\nof time are expressed as functions of a\nfinite set of assumed vibrational\nmodes, and the contribution of each\nmode to the total motion is found by\nsolving Lagrange\'s equations. The\nequations of flow are coupled with the\nequations of structures via an aerodynamic-force vector in the equations of\naeroelasticity, which are solved by use\nof the linear-acceleration method. The\nequations of flow are solved via a timeaccurate, implicit finite-difference\nnumerical-integration scheme, using\ncomputational grids that conform to\nand move with, the aeroelastically\ndeformed wing surface.\nComputations are performed for\nelastic and rigid versions of swept\nfighter wings in steady motion . Rigid\nversions of these wings are forced to\noscillate about fixed angles of attack.\nBoth rigid and flexible versions of\nthese wings are forced to pitch\nupward (ramp motion) from a 0\xc2\xb0 angle\nof attack at various rates. The computations for rigid wings illustrate the\nbehaviors of moving shock waves in\nthe presence of leading-edge vortices,\nand the results of these computations\nagree well with those of experiments.\nThe ramp-motion computations illustrate shock/vortex interactions. They\nalso illustrate the effects of flexibility\nand rate of increase of pitch in flows\nwith vortices.\n\nThis work was done by Guru P.\nGuruswamy of Ames Research\nCenter and Shigeru Obayashi of MCAT\nInstitute.

In this study, both singleand dual-repressor situations were considered, using genetically structured\nmolecules for the lac and IPR promoter/operator in example calculations.\nThe results of the numerical simulations\nsuggest that the most effective control\nof cloned-gene expression would be\nachieved by use of a cross-regulation\nconfiguration carried on a multicopy\nplasmid.

The study was conducted to gain understanding of the\neffects of molecular structures of the\nmembranes on permeabilities and to\nassess the potential for exploitation of\nselective permeability in gas-separation\nprocesses. The gases used in the experiments were H2, O2, N2, CO 2, and CH 4 .\nEach of the four polyimide membranes\nwas made from (a) the dian hydride\nmonomer 2,2 -bis(3 ,4-dicarboxyphenyl)\nhexafluoropropane dianhydride ("6FOA"\nfor short) and (b) one of the following four\ndiamine monomers: meta-phenylenediamine ("m-POA"), 2,4-diaminotoluene\n("2,4-0ATr"), 2,6-diaminotoluene ("2,6OATr") , and 3,5-diaminobenzotrifluoride\n("3,5-0BTF"). The permeabilities were\nmeasured at a temperature of 35\xc2\xb0C, at\npressures from 1.4 to 8.2 atm (0.14 to\n0.83 MPa). The coefficients of permeability (P) of all of the membranes by the\nvarious gases were found to decrease in\nthe order P(H2l > P(C02l > P(02) > P(N2l\n> P(CH 4). In the case of each membrane/gas combination, P was either\ngenerally independent of, or else\ndecreased slightly with, increasing differential pressure across the membrane.\nPermeabilities of three of the membranes were found to increase, and their\nselectivities to some gas pairs to\ndecrease, in the order P(6FDAIm-POA)\n< P(6FDAl2,4-0ATr) < P(6FDA2,6/0ATr); this appears to be due to\nincreasing mean interchain distances in\nthese polymers. The permeability of\n6FOA-3,5/0BTF is higher, and its selectivity lower, than expected from its mean\ninterchain distances, possibly because\nof a higher segmental mobility. This\nstudy demonstrates the potential usefulness of these four polyimides as membrane materials for two gas-separating\nprocesses (C02 and CH 4 , O2 and N2l.\nThe selectivities of these polyimides to\nthe two gas pairs are higher than those\nof other polyimides with comparable\npermeabilities. The polyimides were also\nfound to be more permeable to N2 than\nCH 4 , whereas most other glassy polymers are more permeable to CH 4 \xe2\x80\xa2\nThis work was done by A. K.

In particular, it presents an examination of aircraft automation and its effects on flight\ncrews in relation to human error and aircraft accidents. The use of artificial intelligence in future automation will not\nreplace the need for experienced pilots.\nWhile automation makes an aircraft easier to fly, it brings boredom to the human\noperators, potentially resulting in complacency and errors. It was found that\nredundancy is needed in automated\ncontrols critical to flight. Automation can\nassist flying, but humans must remain in\ncontrol. Automation should be used to\nprovide options and data for use by\nhumans to make decisions.\nThis work was done by Charles\nBillings of Ames Research Center.

In the artificial-compressibility formulation, a term proportional to the\nderivative of pressure with respect to\npseudotime is added to the equation of\ncontinuity, the constant of proportionality\nbeing the reciprocal of an arbitrary\npseudocompressibility parameter. The\n\nequation of continuity is combined with\nthe equations of conservation of momentum, forming a hyperbolic system of\nequations, complete with artificial pressure waves of finite speed. The equations can be integrated numerically by\nmarching (iterating) in pseudotime to a\nsteady-state (with respect to pseudotime) solution.\nIf the flow is time dependent, then one\nperforms such iterations in pseudotime\nat each physical time step. Any of a\nlarge number of compressible-flow\nalgorithms can be used to compute the\nflows in the pseudotime iterations. The\ncomputed flow field satisfies the original\nincompressible equations once the\npseudotime iterations have converged.\nThe present study is part of a continuing effort to find an efficient method of\nsolution of the Navier-Stokes equations\nof three-dimensional flow of an\nincompressible fluid. For the sake of relative ease and reduction of computational\nrequirements, only two-dimensional\nflows are conSidered, with the expectation that extensions to three dimensions\ncan be performed in subsequent studies.\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are\nformulated in generalized two-dimensional curvilinear coordinates. The convective terms are upwind-differenced\non the computational coordinate grid\nvia a flux-difference-split approach that\nyields uniformly high accuracy at points\nthroughout the interior of the grid. This\napproach eliminates the need for\nexplicitly added artificial-dissipation\nterms to suppress numerical instabilities. The viscous fluxes are treated by\nuse of central differences that are accurate to second order.\nAn implicit line-relaxation scheme\nthat is applicable to both steady and\nunsteady flows is used to solve the\nresulting system of finite-difference\nequations. Implicit boundary conditions\nbased on the method of characteristics\nare formulated for all boundaries and\nincorporated into the computer code,\nmaking it possible to use large pseudotime steps and thereby converge on\nthe solution in a relatively small number of iterations.\nThree test cases are presented: driven flow in a square cavity, flow over a\nbackward-facing step, and flow\naround a circular cylinder. The flows\ncomputed for these cases agreed well\nwith flows computed and/or measured in previous studies.\nThis work was done by Stuart Rogers\nand Dochan Kwak of Ames Research\nCenter.

In\nthe region of hyperelasticity there is a\npoint of inflection where the plot swings\nupward, showing an increasing modulus.

The concept of using Coo for\nthis purpose with the expectation of\ngreater efficiency because of its greater\nmolecular mass was described in\n"Electrostatic Propulsion Using Coo\nMolecules" (NPO-18526), NASA Tech\nBriefs, Vol. 17, NO.6 (June, 1993). page\n89. However, the efficiency of an ion\nthruster is affected not only by the molecular mass of the propellant but also by\nthe ionization cross section of the propellant molecules and by the effects of\ndouble and dissociative ionization.\nAccordingly, detailed estimates of the\nionization cross section for electrons\nimpacting on Coo and estimates of\neffects of multiple ionization and dissociative ionization were made via a combination of theoretical prediction and\ninference from experimental data.\nThis work was done by Don Rapp and\nStephanie D.
