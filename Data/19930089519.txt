H. Woodling,\nSUMMARY\nA theoretical investigation has been made of the effects of rudder\nand stabilizer deflections on the angles of attack and sideslip experienced by an airplane in rapid rolls. Expressions are derived from the\nfive-degree-of-freedom airplane equations of motion which define the\nrudder and stabilizer motions necessary to maintain constant angle of\nattack and zero sideslip during an aileron roll. These expressions are\nsimplified and considered as the basis for automatic controls. The effect\non the rolling behavior of the airplane of applying ramp-type rudder and\nstabilizer deflections, similar to the exact rudder and stabilizer inputs\nin magnitude and direction, is also investigated. The results are presented, for the most part, as time histories of the airplane response to\naileron deflections with and without rudder and stabilizer inputs. Maximum loads experienced by the vertical and horizontal tail surfaces during\naileron rolls are calculated for the automatic control investigation.\nThe control motions calculated by using the expressions which are\nderived from the airplane equations of motion are useful in determining\nthe magnitude and direction of the rudder and stabilizer deflections that\nmight be applied by a pilot or by automatic controls to maintain small\nangles of attack and sideslip variations in aileron rolls. For the airplane configuration and flight condition investigated, the ramp-type\nrudder and stabilizer deflections were effective in reducing the angles\nof attack and sideslip in rapid rolls. The automatic rudder and stabilizer had a large favorable effect on the rolling behavior of the airplane for the cases investigated. The maximum loads on the vertical and\nhorizontal tail surfaces were generally reduced when the automatic controls were applied.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n2\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\nNACA RM L57A3Oa\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCurrent fighter airplanes have experienced large changes in angles\nof attack and sideslip, resulting in excessive loads, during rapid rolling\nmaneuvers. A simplified linear analysis of the problem reported in references 1 and 2 indicated that roll coupling between the lateral and longitudinal modes could cause an instability in the form of a divergent motion\nas the rolling velocity of the airplane approaches the natural frequency\nof the airplane in yaw or pitch. The design trend of fighter airplanes\nresulting in large inertia about the pitch and. yaw axes relative to that\nabout the roll axis, coupled with the loss in directional stability as\nMach number increases, are predominant factors contributing to the aforementioned uncontrollable motions.\nTheoretical studies of various means of reducing roll coupling have\nbeen made in references 3, 1, and 5 . References 3 and 1i pointed out\nthat increased pitch damping was very effective in reducing the angles\nof attack and sideslip obtained in aileron rolls. Reference 5 presented\na method of avoiding roll-coupling instability in which rudder and stabilizer inputs were automatically applied to counteract the yawing and\npitching moments produced on the rolling airplane by the predominant\ninertia coupling terms. This paper investigates the possibility of\napplying the rudder and stabilizer in coordination with the ailerons\nso as to roll the airplane with minimum variations in the angles of\nattack and sideslip. The analysis first determines the exact rudder\nand stabilizer inputs that would be required to roll an airplane with\nLa and 3 identically equal to zero. By using these exact rudder and\nstabilizer inputs as an indication of the direction and approximate magnitude of the controls required, the effect of simple ramp-type deflections such as might be applied by a pilot are investigated. Finally the\nexact control expressions are simplified and considered as equations for\nautomatic controls, and their effect on the rolling airplane are studied.\nTime histories of the controls and the time responses of the rolling airplane, calculated on an electronic analog computer, are presented. Since\nthe loads on the horizontal and vertical tails are dependent on the magnitude of the rudder and stabilizer deflections, as well as the motions\nof the airplane, the maximum loads with and without the automatic rudder\nand stabilizer are computed and compared.\nThe rudder and stabilizer expressions defining the controls required\nfor rolling at constant angle of attack and zero sideslip are derived\nfrom the five-degree-of-freedom airplane equation of motion. The quantitative results, such as the airplane time histories and the tail loads\ncalculations, are for a swept-wing airplane configuration flying at one\naltitude and Mach number.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RM L57AOa\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\nSYMBOLS\n\nThe forces and. moments are referred to the body axes system shown\nin figure 1.\nL\t\n\nrolling moment, ft-lb\n\nM\t\n\npitching moment, ft-lb\n\nN\t\n\nyawing moment, ft-lb\n\nY\t\n\nside force, lb\n\nCL\t\n\nlift coefficient,\t\n\nLift\n2\n\npV2S\nY\n\nlateral-force coefficient, \t\n\npV2S\nL\n\nrolling-moment coefficient,\n\nC 1\t\n\nlpV2Sb\nM\n\npitching-moment coefficient,\t\n\nCm\t\n\n2\n\nN\npV Sb\n\nyawing-moment coefficient,\t\n\nC\t\n\npV2S\n\n2\n\nba\t\n\nrate of change of rolling-moment coefficient with aileron\ndeflection, per radian\n\nBr\t\n\nrate of change of yawing-moment coefficient with rudder\ndeflection, per radian\n\nBa\t\n\nrate of change of yawing-moment coefficient with aileron\ndeflection, per radian\n\nC 1\t\n\nC\t\n\nC\t\n\nCm.\t\nit\t\n\nrate of change of pitching moment with stabilizer deflection\n(horizontal tail), per radian\n\nCONF JJJENTIAL\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\nNACA RN L57A3Oa\n\ntotal aileron deflection, radians unless otherwise noted\nstabilizer deflection, positive when trailing edge is down,\nradians unless otherwise noted\nstabilizer deflection from trim value, deg\nrudder deflection, positive when trailing edge is to the\nleft, radians unless otherwise noted\nS\t\n\nwing area, sq ft\n\nb\t\n\nwing span, ft\nmean aerodynaiic chord, ft\n\np\t\n\nair density, slugs/cu ft\n\nV\t\n\nvelocity, ft/sec\n\n\xe2\x82\xac\t\n\nangle between body axis and principal X-axis, positive when\nreference axis is above principal axis at the nose, deg\nmoments of inertia about X, Y, and Z body axes, respectively,\nslug-ft2\n\n1xz\t\n\t\ne\n\nproduct of inertia (positive when principal axis is inclined\nbelow X-body axis), slug-ft2\nmoment of inertia of rotating engine parts about X-body axis,\nslug-ft\n\nm\t\n\nmass of airplane, W/g, slugs\n\nW\t\n\nweight of airplane, lb\n\ng\t\n\nacceleration due to gravity, 32.2 ft/sec2\n\nflg\t\n\nnormal lift acceleration at center of gravity, g units\n\na.\t\n\nangle of attack of airplane body axis, radians unless otherwise noted\nchange in angle of attack from initial or trim value, deg\n\n13\t\n\nangle of sideslip, radians unless otherwise noted\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RM L57AOa\t\n\n0\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\nangle of roll, radians\nangle of yaw, radians\nrolling angular velocity, radians/sec\n\np\n\npitching angular velocity, radians/sec\nr\n\nyawing angular velocity, radians/sec\nengine rotational velocity, radians/sec\ndirection cosines describing orientation of airplane axis\nsystem (see ref. )\n\nt\t\n\ntime, sec\n\nL\na\n\n--\n\nm\n\nCm\n\nci\n2V\n\n2V\nC?, =__!\n\nCn 3 =\n\n\xc3\xa0c\n\n\xc3\xb4c\n13\t\n\nI3\n\nC1 =\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n7\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\n6\t\n\n\xc3\xb4c\n\nC\nlr\n\n2V\noc\n\nC\nnpa\n\nC =__I\nflT\n\n2V\n\na\t\n\n- pV2Sb\n2\t\n\n\xc3\xb6a\n\nL_ pVSb2 C\nlp\n\nL\t r - pVSb2 C1\nL13-\n\nN5r=\n\npV2Sb C\n113\n2\npV2Sb C\n2\n\npV2Sb\nNc =\t\n\'-\'a\n2\nNr =\n\nr\n\nC\n\npVSb2 Cnr\n\nN - pVSb2 C\np-\t\ni.\t\nii\nN - pV2S1\n13\t\n2\t\n= pV 2S\nP\t\n2\t\n\n13\n\n.Lp\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RM L57A3Oa\n\n\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RN L77A3Oa\t\n\npV2Sc\n=\t\n2\t\n\nMj\n\nM\t\n\nM\n\n=\n\npVS2\n\n\t\n\n7\n\nCm\n\nCmq\n\npVS2 Cm.\na\n- pV2S\n2\n\nLt\n\n- pV2S CL\na\n2\t\n\nSubscript:\no\t\n\ninitial condition\n\ncg\t\n\ncenter of gravity\nA dot over a symbol represents a derivative with respect to time.\nEQUATIONS OF MOTION\n\nThe nonlinear airplane equations of motion, referred to airplane\nbody axes (fig. i) and assuming constant forward speed, may be written\nas follows:\nRolling-moment equation\nL\n1x\nPitching-moment equation\nq=\t ____ pr+\n\t\n1\t\n\n(r2p2)\n\ne\t\n\nI\t\n\nM.\nI\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nM\t\n\nMa Ma\nI\n\n\t\n\nNACA RM L57A3Oa\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\n8\t\n\nYawing-moment equation\n\n____\t\nI z\t\n\nN8\t\nIXWe\t\ne ci+\t\nIz\t\nIz\t\n\npq +\nIz\t\n\nN8\t\nN\t\nN\n8r8 +.Lr+-p+\na\nT\t\nIz\nIz\t\nJz\t\n\nIz\nLateral-force equation\ng\n\nNormal-force equation\n- pf3 +\t\n\n=\t\n\nn -\n\nL\'\nmV\n\nDirection cosine equations\n= m3r - n3q\r\n= n3p - 13r\r\n11\n\n3 = 1 3 q - m3p\n\nThe direction cosine equations were used to include the proper component\nof the gravity vector in the two force equations.\nANALYSIS\nThis paper investigates the possibility of applying rudder and stabilizer, either by a pilot or by an automatic control, in coordination\nwith the ailerons so as to roll the airplane with a minimum of variation\nin the angles of attack and sideslip. The analysis determines the exact\nrudder and stabilizer motions that are required to roll an airplane with\nand 13 identically equal to zero. Based on these control motions\nan indication is obtained of the direction and magnitude of rudder and\nstabilizer that might be applied by a pilot to maintain small variations\nin the angles of attack and sideslip during rapid rolls.

They are exact in the sense that they will produce Lrt\nand 13 identically equal to zero for any rolling input according to the\nequations from which they were derived.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n11\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\nNACA RM L57A3Oa\t\n\nAutomatic Rudder and Stabilizer Deflections for\n&z. and\n\np\n\nApproximately Equal to Zero\n\nThe expressions for the proposed automatic controls are derived\nfrom the exact control equations. In order to simplify the exact rudder\nand stabilizer expressions (eqs. (5) and (6)), it is assumed that they\nare derived from the equations of motion referenced to principal body\naxes. In practice if the sensing instruments for the automatic controls\nare aimed to record the motions of the airplane relative to the prin-.\ncipal body axes then the effect of the product of inertia on the recorded\nquantities will be zero. Therefore the 1xz terms in expressions (5)\nand (6) are zero. The angle of attack in equations (5) and (6) now is\nthe angle of attack of the principal X-axis of the airplane. Also the\nassumption is made that the gravity terms in equations (3) and (1) can\nn3 contain the effect of the\nin3 and\t\nbe neglected.

The last term in equation (11)\ndefines the rudder required to counteract the yawing moment on the airplane produced by the engine gyroscopic term IXWe and the pitching\nL\'\nvelocity q \xe2\x80\x94a a0 . If this term is retained in the rudder equation\nmV\nthe yawing torque will be automatically compensated for. However in\nthis analysis the term is deleted assuming that in a g maneuver if the\nyawing moment due to the engine is noticeable, the pilot will generally\napply approximate corrective rudder. The last two terms or the stabilizer equation, which are not a function of the roll rate, are also\ndeleted. These two terms define the approximate stabilizer deflection\nrequired to trir the airplane at a 0 . If the gravity term\t\nn3 had\nnot been neglected (in eq. (8)), in the derivation of the automatic control equations, the trim value of it would be determined exactly by\nthese two terms. Assuming then that the pilot will apply the necessary\nstabilizer deflection to trim the airplane at a 0, the incremental stabilizer to be applied automatically during a rolling maneuver is given\nby the first two terms of equation (12). When those terms which have\nbeen suggested are deleted, the final equations to be used for the automatic rudder and stabilizer are as follows:\n- [(Ix\t\n\nL a +\t\n\n= N8r\t\n\nCOTIFIDENTIAL\n\na +\t\n\np - a\n\n6 a} (13)\n\nNACA RM L57A3Oa\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\n13\n\nand.\n_______\t\n-ly I[(iz\t x)a12\n__\t\n-\t\n\n+\t\n\n__\n\n71x \xc2\xb0e\ne a)}\t\n\n(i)\n\nThe term a0 appearing in the stabilizer and rudder expressions is\ndefined as the initial angle of attack or the angle of attack from which.\nthe roll is initiated. If the airplane is rolled from 2g or 3g flight,\nthe a0 in the stabilizer and rudder expressions must be the a corresponding to 2g or 3g. It is of interest to note that expressions (v),\n(8), and (9) indicate that the larger the a 0 (higher g conditions)\nfrom which the airplane is rolled, the higher the required yaw rate and\nacceleration (for the same roll rate) and the pitch rate must be. These\nhigher rates result in proportionally larger required rudder and stabilizer deflections.\nRESULTS MID DISCUSSION\nThe results of the analysis are for the most part presented as time\nhistories of airplane motion and control inputs computed on an electronic\nanalog computer. These results are divided into three parts, namely:\n(1) Time histories of the exact rudder and stabilizer inputs calculated by equations (5) and (6) for several g conditions and several\naileron deflect ions.\n(2) Time histories of the airplane response in aileron rolls to\nramp rudder and stabilizer inputs similar to the exact control inputs\nin magnitude and direction.\n(3) The effect of automatic rudder and stabilizer control on the\nairplane response in aileron rolls and calculation of the vertical and\nhorizontal tail loads produced by these controls during rolling.\nThe time histories were calculated. using the five-degree-of-freedom airplane equations of motion. The airplane used in this study was a sweptwing fighter airplane configuration, assumed to be flying at an altitude\nof 32,000 feet and a Mach number of 0.7. The stability derivatives,\nmass characteristics of the airplane and other constants used. in the\nstudy are presented in table I. All the time histories presented are\nfor left rolls only, since for the conditions investigated this direction\nof roll is more severe than right rolls. This difference in right and\nleft rolls can be attributed to the asymmetric moments produced on the\naircraft by the rotating engine (ref s. (3) and (6)). The analog runs\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n1I\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\nNACA RM L57A3Oa\n\nfor rolls with aileron alone, that is, stabilizer and rudder not applied,\nare for approximately 360 0 roll angle. Generally, for these cases the\nairplane after rolling.360\xc2\xb0 would not remain at zero bank angle but would\nreverse in roll direction due to the rolling moment produced by the\neffective dihedral. No attempt was made to stop this rolling after the\n3600 roll angle was obtained. A simple ramp-type aileron input with a\n50 0 per second rate was used throughout the investigation.\nExact Rudder and Stabilizer Inputs \r\nfor\t\n\nx = f3 = 0\n\nThe airplane time histories with and without the exact rudder and\nstabilizer inputs and also the time histories of the rudder and stabilizer deflections calculated by equations (5) and (6) are shown in figure 2. The two cases on each figure are compared for the same aileron\ninput. Figure 2(a) shows the response of the airplane to a 20\xc2\xb0 ramp\naileron deflection. The airplane is initially at 1 g trim flight and\nrolled from this condition. For the aileron-alone case, i.j is held\nat its initial trim value and or at zero. For this case the angle of\n_50 and _200, respectively,\nattack and angle of sideslip reach values of\nduring the rolling. Notice the rapid change experienced in the angles\nof attack and sideslip during the recovery phase, that is, after the\naileron has been returned to zero. When 8r and it are applied as\ndefined by equations (5) and (6), respectively, the angle of attack\nremains at its initial value and the angle of sideslip remains at zero\nduring the rolling. It should be noted that the roll rate response is\nsomewhat improved. The lack of overshoot in the roll rate response\nduring the recovery phase and the higher level of rolling velocity for\nzero ict and 13 is mainly the result of zero dihedral effect during\nthe maneuver. The increase in the roll velocity is more pronounced in\nsome of the subsequent figures. The maximum incremental stabilizer\ndeflection required is about +2\xc2\xb0. It is interesting to note that the\ndirection of the stabilizer is such to produce a pitch-dom moment on\nthe airplane, or probably opposite stabilizer to that which a pilot\nwould instinctively apply as he experienced the negative normal g due\nto the angle of attack. The maximum rudder deflection required is\nabout +l)i0 and _50. The change in sign of the rudder deflection is\nterm in the 8r equation (eq. (5)).\nprincipally due to the \t\nFigure 2(b) shows the response of the airplane to a 30\xc2\xb0 ramp aileron\ninput. The airplane is initially at 1 g trim flight. For the aileronalone case, the maximum excursions in a. and 13 are slightly less than\nthose shown in figure 2(a). According to reference 3, which presents an\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RN L 5TA3Oa\t\n\nC011FIDENTIAL\t\n\n15\n\nanalysis for an airplane of almost identical mass and aerodynamic characteristics and for the same flight condition, the maximum excursions\nin a. and 13 due to roll coupling occur for average roll rates between\n-1.5 and -2.0 radians per second. Average roll rate in this case is\ndefined as 2it divided by the time required to roll to 360\xc2\xb0. Although\nthe roll angle record is not shown for the cases presented in this paper,\nthe average roll rate calculated from unpublished analog results for\nfigure 2(a) is about -1.9 radians per second and for figure 2(b) about\n_2. Li. radians per second. This explains the slight decrease in the maximum angles obtained for figure 2(b) as compared with figure 2(a). The\nmaximum incremental stabilizer and the rudder deflections required for\n= 13 0 are larger than those for ba = 20\xc2\xb0 due to the dependency\nof the it and r on the roll rate. Comparison of figures 2(a) and\n2(b) also indicates that the magnitude of the prescribed yaw rate, but\nnot the magnitude of the pitch rate, is a function of the roll velocity\n(see eqs. (3) and ()i.)).\nFigure 2(c) shows the response of the airplane to a 200 aileron\ndeflection. For this case, the airplane is rolled from a steady 2g condition. The rolling for this case and all subsequent 2g cases is initiated with the flight path horizontal. An initial pitch rate of about\n0.05 radian per second and an angle of attack of 100 is required for\nconstant g flight. The trim stabilizer deflection is -3.5\xc2\xb0. For the\naileron-alone case, because of the low roll rate (an average roll rate\nof -0.9 radian/second), the aileron had to be held on about 1 seconds\nin order to roll the airplane through 360\xc2\xb0. The small roll rate is a\ndirect result of the large opposing rolling moment produced on the airplane by the relatively high value of the effective dihedral C 113 at\nan angle of attack of 10\xc2\xb0. (See table I.) Because of the low rate\ndeveloped, this case does not exhibit any serious roll coupling tendencies.\nWhen t and r are applied, a large increase in the roll velocity is\nnoticed and, in fact, since the same aileron input was used, the airplane\nfor this case rolled through almost 1,080\xc2\xb0 of roll angle. Notice that\nthe stabilizer and rudder deflections for this case are approximately\ntwice as large as those shown in figure 2(a). This results from the\nfact that the angle of attack from which the roll is initiated in this\ncase is exactly double that for the 1 g case. The maximum pitching and\nyawing velocities for LcL = 13 = 0 for this case are also increased for\nthe same reason.\nFigure 2(d) shows the response of the airplane to a 30\xc2\xb0 aileron\ndeflection, where the airplane is initially at 2g. The aileron-alone\ncase exhibits very severe roll-coupled motions. Relatively large stabilizer and rudder deflections are needed to keep ia and 13 zero\nbecause of the combination of the large angle of attack and the high\nroll rate developed. A sizeable increase in roll rate is noticed for\nthe\t\nt=13 =0 case.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n16\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\nNACA RM L57A3Oa\n\nIt should be noted that in figure 2 and the subsequent figures\nthe magnitude of the rudder and stabilizer deflections required for\n= = 0 are inversely proportional to the effectiveness of the control surfaces. That is, if the control effectiveness - especially in\nthe case of the rudder - could be increased, the corresponding deflection would be decreased. As has been pointed out in reference 5 the\n(rudder effectiveness) for this airplane is only\nassumed value of C \t\nabout one-third of that provided bn many airplanes. However a decrease\nin deflection due to increased control effectiveness would not mean a\nreduction in the tail loads.\nEffect of Ramp-ype Rudder and Stabilizer Inputs \r\non the Airplane Response in Aileron Rolls\nUsing the time histories of the stabilizer and rudder deflections\nshown in figure 2 as a basis of the controls required for rolling with\nsmall changes in the angles of attack and sideslip, the effect of some\nramp-type i- and r inputs on the rolling airplane is presented in\nfigures 3 and Li-. All the ranrp rudder and stabilizer inputs were applied\nsimultaneously with the aileron. Also, they were reversed to return them\nto their initial value at approximately the same time as the aileron\nreversal was effected. The rate for all the stabilizer deflections was\nassumed to be 50 per second and the rate for the rudder deflections\nwas set at 20 0 per second.\nwith\n3(b)\n=\nfor\n\nFigure 3 presents a comparison of the effect of the ramp inputs\nthat of the exact rudder and stabilizer inputs. Figures 3(a) and\n1 and\npresent the airplane time histories for (n g)\t\n200 and 300, respectively. Figure 3(c) shows the time histories\n= 300 . The aileron-alone cases and the exact\n(ng) = 2 and\t\n\ncontrol input cases are repeated from figure 2. The magnitude of the\nramp rudder and stabilizer deflections that were used in figure 3 are\na rough approximation of the average values of the exact it and\nAlso, the ramps were applied in only one direction, that is, it can be\nseen that in the case of the rudder deflection no attempt was made to\nfollow the exact rudder to its negative value and then back to zero.\nIn spite of these differences from the ideal rudder and stabilizer inputs,\nthe angles of attack and sideslip variations were considerably reduced\nfrom those obtained for the aileron-alone cases. The tendency for the\no response to vary rather abruptly at the initial part of the maneuver\nfor the ramp input cases is due mainly to the stabilizer deflection that\nwas used. That is, because of the rate and time of application assumed\nfor the stabilizer, this control causes the airplane initially to pitch\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RN L57A5Oa\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\n17\n\nnegatively, which results in a corresponding decrease in the angle of\nattack. With reference to the exact stabilizer motion, it appears that\nif the stabilizer deflection would have been applied at a slower rate\nor with some delay, smaller a changes would have been experienced.\nEven though the angle of attack still varied abruptly (particularly in\nfigures 5(b) and 5(c)) when the ramp deflections were applied, the total\nangle of attack never reached the negative values as did the aileronalone cases.\nSince the rudder and stabilizer deflections shown in figure 5 were\napplied at the beginning of the roll maneuver, these results are more\nindicative of the effect of preventive, rather than corrective, controls.\nPreventive controls, as used here, are defined as controls applied in\nsuch a manner so as to prevent subsequent deviations, such as those\napplied with the aileron at the initiation of the roll maneuver in figure 5. Corrective controls would be applied after some deviation occurs for instance, at t = 1.7 seconds for the solid curves of figure 5(a).\nNormally in a rolling maneuver the pilot will attempt some sort of coordination of the controls, such as the application of the rudder with the\naileron to maintain small angles of sideslip. In some cases the effectiveness of rudder for controlling the sideslip may be considerably\nreduced due to adverse moment produced by the inertia coupling term\n(I - Iy)pq. This term becomes significantly large in many cases because\nof the high roll rate and also the relatively large pitching velocity\nthat is developed during rapid rolls. For example, notice the values\nof pitching velocity that are encountered during the aileron-alone cases\nshown in figure 5. High rates of pitching have also been experienced\nin actual flight maneuvers such as reported in references 7, 8, and 9.\nIn fact, it is this pitching velocity coupled with the rolling velocity\nthat produces a yawing moment opposite to that produced by the stabilizing NL3. When the yawing moment due to pq becomes larger than\nthat due to N13, rolling instability results. Proper stabilizer inputs\nto maintain a minimum amount of pitching during rapid rolls, which may\nbe contrary to pilot stimuli, then should not only permit more favorable\nuse of the rudder but should also reduce the possibility of instability\ndue to roll coupling. This is borne out in figure 5 for the three cases\nshown. Also, the fact that reduction of the pitching velocity in rapid\nrolls tends to reduce the severity of the maneuver was pointed out in\nreferences 3 and t4, where analog results indicated that ideal pitch\ndampers were very effective in reducing the angles of attack and sideslip encountered in aileron rolls.\nFigure shows the effect of several combinations of ramp rudder\nand stabilizer deflections applied with the aileron. Figures li-(a), li-(c),\nand )-i-(e) present a comparison of the relative importance of the rudder\nand of the stabilizer when applied separately with the aileron. Figures 1-(b), 1-(d), and )i-(f) give some indication of the sensitivity of the\nCONF IDENTIAL\n\n18\t\n\nCONFIDEI\'ITIAL\t\n\nNACA RM L57A30a\n\nrolling airplane to the magnitude of the applied stabilizer deflections.\n= 1 arid ba = 20 0 , it can be seen that all\nIn figure li-(a) for (n\t\nthree of the control combinations were effective in reducing the a.\nand 3 motions during the recovery phase of the maneuver. With the\nexception of the first negative variation of i, the angles of attack\n= 0 are nearly the same as those\nand sideslip variations for \t\nobtained when both the rudder and stabilizer are applied with the aileron.\n= 0 case exhibits small\r\nIt should be noted that even though the \t\nangles of attack and sideslip variations these results should be evaluated in light of the low level of roll rate experienced for this case.\nThat is, since the low roll rate is responsible, in part, for the small\nvariations it is probable that if a larger aileron deflection were used\nin this case to produce a larger roll rate the angles of attack and\nsideslip variations would also be increased. It appears that if a comparatively high rate of rolling is required the stabilizer applied with\nthe aileron is at least as effective, and in some cases (see figs. ).i-(c)\nand )--(e)) more effective, in maintaining small variations in the angles\nof attack and sideslip than the rudder applied with the aileron.\nSince the stabilizer when applied in combination with the rudder\nand aileron appears to be quite effective in reducing the angles of\nattack and sideslip variations, it is important to know how sensitive\nthe airplane at this flight condition is to the magnitude of the stabilizer deflection. Figure b) shows three values of \t\nwith r 10\xc2\xb0\n= 20\xc2\xb0. Even though the angles of attack and\nfor (n\t\n= 1 and\t\nsideslip variations are directly dependent on the magnitude of i\'\nall three cases offer a definite improvement, especially during the\nrecovery phase, over the aileron-alone case shown in figure 3(a).\nAlthough the range of values shown here for\t\n-t is small, it should\nbe remembered that the\t\nper g is about l.\'(. Thus a pilot, because\nof this high sensitivity of the control, could probably distinguish\nbetween say 1 0 or 30 of stabilizer deflection. It is also interesting\nto note the effect that the longitudinal control (sit) has on the lateral variables, namely, yawing velocity and sideslip angle. The difference in the yaw rate and, consequently, the sideslip is attributed to\nthe (I - Iy)pq term in the yawing-moment equation. The angle-ofattack response during the initial part of the maneuver is seen to be\nproportional to the magnitude of \t\nThis effect was mentioned in\nthe discussion of figure 3.\nFigure c) shows the effect of the rudder and stabilizer deflections for an aileron input of 30\xc2\xb0 and (ng) = 1. Note that for \t\n=0\nthe rudder input of 15\xc2\xb0 is not sufficient to yaw the airplane favorably\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA R14 L57A3Oa\t\n\n\t\n19\n\nduring the complete maneuver. However, when both the stabilizer and.\nrudder are applied the pitch rate is reduced, thereby reducing the\nyawing moment due to pq and the resulting yawing is mostly negative.\nAgain, the angles of attack and sideslip variations for r = 0 are\nonly slightly different from those obtained when both the rudder and\nstabilizer are applied. Figure 1i(d) presents results similar to those\nof figure (b) for (n g) = 1 and \xc3\xb6a = 30 0 . Note again the proportional change in the yawing rate with the magnitude of LSi.t.\nFigures 1(e) and !l(f) show the airplane response to\t Sa = 3Q0 and\n\\\ncombinations of rudder and stabilizer deulections for In g1\n= 2. The\nresults shown in figure 1(e) indicate that the stabilizer when applied\nwith the aileron maintained smaller values of 13 than for the case of\nthe rudder and aileron combination, even though the level of roll rate\n= 0 is much higher than that for -t = 0. Figure Ii-(f)\nfor the\t\npresents the effect of two different stabilizer deflections applied\nwith both r and \xc3\xb6a equal to 3Q0 and (n\t g1\n= 2. The angles of\r\nattack and sideslip variations for both the hit\'s show a large reduction from the aileron case of figure 3(c).\nEffects of Automatic Controls Designed To Minimize the\r\nAngles of Attack and Sideslip Variations\nin Rapid Rolls\nThe human pilot, even though he has some idea of the rudder and\nstabilizer deflections necessary to maintain small variations in the\nangles of attack and sideslip during aileron rolls, may still be unable to\ncope with the complexity and rapidity of the motions that are encountered\nin such maneuvers. Therefore, it may become necessary to resort to some\ntype of automatic control. A brief investigation has been made which\nconsiders the rudder and stabilizer as defined by equations (13) and (1)-i-),\nrespectively, as possible automatic controls. In this investigation,\nthe automatic control inputs were assumed to be perfect in that zero\ntime lag was assumed for the control servos. Also, no limitations of\nrate or magnitude were assumed for either the rudder or stabilizer\nmotion.\nIn the analysis, for the sake of simplification, the expressions\ndefining the automatic rudder and stabilizer were derived from the airplane equations of motion for principal body axes. In practice, as was\nmentioned previously, the instruments for sensing the values of p,\nand 0D\' which are required for the automatic rudder and stabilizer,\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n20\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\nNACA RN L57A3Qa\n\nwould be aimed to record these quantities about the principal axis.\nIn the analog investigation of the automatic controls, the airplane\nconfiguration that was used was assumed. to have the same characteristics as those presented in table I with the exception of I>, which\nwas taken as zero.\nThe effects of the rudder and stabilizer inputs as defined by equations (13) and (1)-f) are presented in figure 5. Figure 5(a) shows the\neffect on the airplane response for 8a = 20 0 when the airplane i\ninitially at 1 g. It can be seen that angles of attack and sideslip\nvariations remain almost zero when the stabilizer and rudder are operating. Since these results are very similar to those presented in figure 2(a) for the exact controls, the assuniptions used in simplifying\nthe exact control expressions to obtain equations (13) and (i ii-) are\napparently valid for this airplane and flight condition. The maximum\nincremental stabilizer deflection required is approximately 2\xc2\xb0 and the\nrudder reaches maximum values of i1i. and _90\xe2\x80\xa2 The roll rate response\nis somewhat improved when the stabilizer and rudder are operating. This\nimprovement, as was indicated in a previous section, is mainly the result\nof almost zero dihedral effect due to the practically zero J3 during\nthe maneuver. Figure 5(b) presents the control inputs for (n g) = 1\nand a = 30\xc2\xb0. The magnitude of the stabilizer and rudder deflections\nis increased from the a = 20 0 case because of the higher roll rate\ndeveloped for the larger aileron deflection. Figure 5(c) shows the airplane time histories when the airplane is rolled from 2g trim flight.\nFor the a = 3Q0 aileron-alone case the airplane rolled only about\n2000 and therefore experienced a somewhat less violent maneuver than\nthe 3600 rolls previously presented for this flight condition. Two\naileron defiections were considered with the automatic controls operating. For 8a = 30 0 , it can be seen that the roll rate is markedly\nincreased when the rudder and stabilizer are operating. Because of this\nhigh rate of rolling and the relatively large angle of attack from which\nthe roll is initiated, the necessary rudder and stabilizer deflections\nare large. Such control deflections may be unattainable or impractical\nbecause of the excessive.loads they might produce on the tail surfaces.\nSome calculations of the loads are discussed briefly in the next section.\nSince a significant increase is generally obtained in the roll rate for\na particular aileron deflection when the automatic controls are used,\na smaller aileron deflection may be sufficient to produce the roll rate\nrequired for a specific maneuver. For a = 20 0 and the automatic controls operating the roll rate developed is still higher than that shown\nfor a = 30 0 with aileron alone. The necessary stabilizer and rudder\ndeflections for this case (5a = 200) are considerably less than those\nrequired for \xc3\xb6a 300.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RM L 5TA 3 Oa\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\n21\n\nEffect of the Automatic Controls on Tail Loads\nRolling an airplane with small variations in the angles of attack\nand sideslip by proper rudder and stabilizer inputs does not guarantee\nthat loads on the tail surfaces will necessarily be small. The rudder\nand stabilizer deflections required for maintaining the small variations\nmay produce loads which are larger than those experienced for zero control deflections and varying angles of attack and sideslip. In order\nto determine the loads produced on the tail surfaces when the automatic\nrudder and stabilizer are utilized, the maximum loads on the vertical\nand horizontal tails were calculated for the aileron rolls presented\nin figure 5.\nListed in table 11(a) are the maximum positive and negative tail\nloads computed for the two g conditions and two aileron deflections.\nPresented in table 11(b) are the assumed tail characteristics and\nexpressions that were used for calculating the horizontal and vertical\ntail loads. It should be pointed out that the loads listed for the\ncases where the automatic controls are not operating are mainly due to\nthe attitude and angular motions of the airplane, whereas the loads\nlisted for the cases of the controls operating are principally due to\nthe magnitude of the rudder or stabilizer deflections. An initial load\nis given for the horizontal tail in each case, which is produced by the\ninitial or trim values of a. and it . No negative loads are indicated\nfor the horizontal tail when the automatic controls are operating since\nthe loads experienced for these inputs always remain positive. For\nboth aileron deflections at (ng ) = 1, the maximum loads are reduced\nwhen the automatic controls are operating. However, at (ng) \t\n2 and\r\n= 30 0 (fig. 5(c)), only the vertical tail loads show a reduction\nwith the automatic rudder and stabilizer. The increase in the horizontal\ntail load is due mainly to the comparatively large stabilizer deflection\nrequired. However, since the magnitude of the controls is proportional\nto the magnitude of the roll rate developed, if an aileron deflection\nof 200 is applied for this condition the control deflections are considerably reduced, even though the roll rate is greater than that for the\ncase of a = 30\xc2\xb0 without automatic control. The last row in table 11(a)\nlists the loads experienced.for a = 20 0 and (ng) 0 = 2 with the automatic rudder and stabilizer operating. Comparing these loads with those\nfor 6a = 3Q0 and (ng) 0 = 2 without the automatic controls shows a\nsubstantial reduction in both the horizontal and vertical tail loads\nwhen the automatic rudder and stabilizer are applied.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n22\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\nNACA RM L57A3Oa\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nExpressions have been derived from the five-degree-of-freedom airplane equations of motion which define the rudder and stabilizer motions\nnecessary to maintain cons.tant angle of attack and zero sideslip during\nan aileron roll. The control motions calculated by using these expressions are useful in determining the magnitude and direction of the rudder and stabilizer deflections that might be applied by a pilot or by\nautomatic controls to maintain small variations in aileron rolls.\nFor the airplane configuration and flight condition investigated,\nsimple ramp-type rudder and stabilizer deflections, applied with the\naileron and similar to the exact inputs in magnitude and direction, were\neffective in reducing the angles of attack and sideslip in rapid rolls.\nThe ramp stabilizer deflections applied with the aileron were nearly\nas effective as the rudder and stabilizer deflections for the cases\ninvestigated.\nThe expressions defining the exact rudder and stabilizer necessary\nfor zero variation of the angles of attack and sideslip during rolling\nwere simplified and considered as the basis for automatic controls. For\nthe airplane configuration and flight condition investigated, and assuming\nno rate or magnitude limitations and zero time lag for the control inputs,\nthe automatic rudder and stabilizer controls were very effective in\nreducing the angles of attack and sideslip developed during rolling.\nThe roll rate was increased and the roll rate response was considerably\nimproved when the automatic controls were applied. The automatic controls generally reduced the maximum loads experienced by the vertical\nand horizontal tail surfaces during the aileron rolls.\n\nLangley Aeronautical Laboratory,\nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,\nLangley Field, Va., January 10, 1957.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RN L57A3Oa\t\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\t\n\n23\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
