Configurations were developed and subsystems analysis was carried out to optimize the suitability of the spacecraft to the missions. The primary conclusion is that the basic AE/DE spacecraft can readily be applied to the LGO mission with relatively minor, low risk modifications. The MGO mission poses a somewhat more complex problem, primarily due to the overall maneuvering hydrazine budget and power requirements of the sensors and their desired duty cycle. These considerations dictate a modification (scaling up) of the structure to support mission requirements.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830014009, "id": "da6517a023d54923812cfeda03452c48", "publicationDate": "1983-01-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830014009.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830014009/downloads/19830014009.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830014009/downloads/19830014009.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830014009/downloads/19830014009.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
