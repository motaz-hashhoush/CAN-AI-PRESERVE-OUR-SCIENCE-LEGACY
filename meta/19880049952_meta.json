Descriptions of the fluid flow phenomena are presented along with an indication of the trends obtained from experimental investigations. In particular, three problem areas are reviewed: (1) the performance losses sustained by a VSTOL aircraft hovering out-of-ground effect, (2) the induced aerodynamic effects encountered as a VSTOL aircraft flies on the combination of powered and aerodynamic lifts between hover and cruise out-of-ground effect, and (3) the aerodynamic characteristics caused by deflected thrust during maneuvering flight over a wide range of both angle of attack and Mach number.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19880049952, "endDate": "1987-12-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "SAE,  DOT,  DOD,  and NASA."}}, "meetingId": "e92addf8aecc4f7ba58f8ab4d9f849b8", "id": "bb16b6d1f31e42d69d808288a0bfecc7"}], "name": "International Powered Lift Conference and Exposition", "location": "Santa Clara, CA", "id": "e92addf8aecc4f7ba58f8ab4d9f849b8", "startDate": "1987-12-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880049952, "id": "31dd5d26c60141f9ba3c9b65a1d7de4f", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
