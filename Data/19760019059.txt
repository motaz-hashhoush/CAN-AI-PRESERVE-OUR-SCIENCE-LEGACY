Anderson, Jr., Publications Manager in the NASA\nHistory Office, has overseen the production of NASA historical publications since 1961. Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he received his B.A.\ndegree in English from Birmingham-Southern College and his M.A.\nand Ph.D. degrees from the University of North Carolina, where he\ntaught English. He served in the Army Air Force during World War II\nand in the Air Force during the Korean War. From 1954 to 1961 he\nwas managing editor of the Air University Review, following three years\nas assistant and then associate editor. He also has been a historian at\nthe Air University and an editorial consultant for the Air War College.\nThe editor of Great Flying Stories (Dell, 1950), he was a consulting editor for Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary and the\nauthor of "Satellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flights" and\n"Major NASA Launches" in NASA\'s annual Astronautics and Aeronautics chronology volumes for 1962 through 1967.\n\nForeword\nA number of scientists and science writers have assessed our\ntwentieth century efforts in aeronautics and space from a hypothetical\nvantage point a few hundred years hence. All have maintained that\nour methods, machines, and achievements will then seem to have been\npitifully limited and primitive. We can, of course, play the same game\nwith history. To someone viewing the world from the vantage point\nof a jet airliner, the Montgolfier balloon of less than 200 years ago or\nthe man flying prone and exposed on the skeleton of a Wright Flyer\nsome 70 years ago can also seem primitive. Yet the learning curve that\nculminated in the creation of that airliner had its beginnings in those\ncourageous early ventures.\nTo those of us who have spent a large part of our lives working in\naeronautics and the space program, the perspective is different and yet\nsimilar. When you are working on a project, beseiged by deadlines,\nprogress often seems agonizingly slow, answers tantalizingly elusive.\nYet when, in the midst of the exciting development of the Space Shuttle,\nyou look back to a corresponding point in the Apollo program a mere\nten years ago, the sense of rapid progress is very real.\nThe approach of our national bicentennial is cause for such reflections about many aspects of our national life. In this small volume\nNASA offers an overview of the Federal government\'s role in contributing, by research and development, to the advancement of aeronautics\nand of space exploration. Though these pages cover less than a third\nof our 200-year history as a nation, they trace the flight of man from\na wobbly few hundred feet above the Earth\'s surface to confident walks\nand rides on the surface of the Moon. And a machine made by man\neven now nears the edge of our solar system and will proceed into the\nvastness of interstellar space.\nMuch will be said during our bicentennial celebration about the\nrole of the venturesome spirit of man in the conquest of the American\nfrontier. Science and technology have been worthy servants of that\n\nVI\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nspirit. The railroad and the electric telegraph were key elements in our\nwestward expansion. But we might do well to remember that the\nstandard gauge of the track of the American railroad was copied from\ncoal-hauling wagons in northern England. And the dots and dashes\nof the Morse code which the telegraph flashed across the continent had\nprecedent in the long and short flashes of light with which Napoleon\'s\nsemaphore stations communicated across Europe. Which is to say that\ntechnological change, like all change, tends to carry with it much of\nthe past.\nIn this century the American spirit has responded vigorously to the\nfrontiers of air and space. Science and technology have responded with\nenlarged understanding and better vehicles. We begin our third hundred years as a nation with a space frontier of endless challenge. An\nunexcelled team of government, industry, and university facilities and\npeople stands ready to provide more and more effective equipment for\nthe venture.\nGEORGE M.

Again and again we had to say that none existed. There had\nbeen one once, back in 1965, when Eugene M. Emme, NASA Historian, wrote a Historical Sketch of NASA (EP-29). But it had been\nout of print for several years and by now was outdated enough to discourage a reprint. The project of a new short history kept nagging at\nour collective conscience, but we were busy with other things. It was\nnot hard to convince ourselves that we just couldn\'t stretch our staff\nresources that much.\nThen last year that persuasive imperative, necessity, took a hand.\nThe American Public Works Association, armed with the blessing of\na joint congressional resolution, was preparing a bicentennial volume\nof the history of 200 years of public works in the United States.\nAssociation officers asked the NASA Administrator, James C. Fletcher,\nto have a chapter prepared on the aeronautics and space programs.\nDr. Fletcher agreed; the project was assigned to our office. So now it\nwould be done; the only question was whether someone in the office\nwould do it or whether we would contract for a manuscript. Mindful\nof our long-felt need for a similar manuscript, I volunteered. The\nbicentennial volume got its chapter and here, revised and somewhat\nenlarged, is the NASA version.\nBecause of the purpose for which it was originally written, it contains no reference notes and only a generalized bibliography. So I\ncannot blame the sources for errors or deficiences; they are of my own\ncobbling.\nJune 1975\n\nF.W.A.\n\nIX\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\nI\nRise of Aeronautics\nIn 1913 the clouds of war were gathering over Europe\xe2\x80\x94and casting their shadows on America. The European powers were racing to\narm themselves against each other\xe2\x80\x94not only with conventional land\nand sea armaments, but also with the new weapon of the twentieth\ncentury\xe2\x80\x94the airplane. In their race they overcame the U.S. lead established by the Wright brothers and left this country in a technological\nbackwash. Particularly disturbing to American observers was our primitive and unorganized aeronautical establishment\xe2\x80\x94a frail shadow of\nthe research facilities and government subsidized industries arising in\nEurope.\nMost active among the small group of concerned men in the\nUnited States was the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Charles\nD. Wolcott. Convinced that the situation called for Federal sponsorship\nof an aviation organization, he worked hard selling the idea both inside\nand outside the Government. After several false starts, he succeeded.\nOn 3 March 1915, President Woodrow Wilson signed into law a Navy\nappropriations bill with a rider establishing an independent Advisory\nCommittee for Aeronautics. The munificent sum of $5000 was appropriated for the Committee\'s first year\'s operations.\nThe new Committee was unique in organizational structure, though\nin years to come it was to serve as a model for several others. Twelve\npresidentially appointed members, serving without pay, drawn from\nthe military and scientific sides of government and from the scientific\ncommunity at large, were charged "to supervise and direct the scientific\nstudy of the problems of flight, with a view to their practical solution,"\nand to "direct and conduct research and experiments in aeronautics."\nFirst among the tasks of the Committee was to find the dimensions\nof the problem. They set out to survey the state of aeronautics in the\nUnited States. If their purpose had been to justify their existence, they\n\n2\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nwould have found the results amply rewarding. Aviation was generally\nregarded as a dare-devil sport practiced by a handful of wealthy young\nmen. Aeronautical research was virtually nonexistent. Only two\nAmerican universities even offered courses in aeronautical engineering.\nResearch facilities such as wind tunnels were pitifully few in number\nand unsystematized in use. The aviation "industry" was a scattered\ncollection of small handicraft shops. The military services had bought\nonly a few dozen airplanes in the brief history of aviation, and nearlyall of them were fatally obsolete by current European standards. And\nfinally, none of the work in aeronautics within the government (located\nin the Weather Bureau, the Bureau of Standards, and the military\nservices) and in the civil sector was coordinated. Clearly a Federal\nlaboratory for aeronautical research was urgently needed.\nArmy, Navy, and the Committee agreed to establish a joint research\ncenter. Since the War Department had funds for acquiring real estate,\nit bought a tract of land on the Back River near Hampton, Virginia.\nThe intent was to colocate the aeronautical research facilities of the\ntwo military services and the Committee. Realities of war intervened,\nhowever; the War Department left its research at McCook Field in\nDayton, Ohio (later Wright Field, now Wright-Patterson Air Force\nBase); the Navy located its facility in Norfolk, Virginia. The National\nAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics\xe2\x80\x94already acronymed NACA\xe2\x80\x94\nwent ahead with construction. Even so it was too late for the laboratory to begin operations in time to assist the war effort. Not until\n11 June 1920 was the three-building complex\xe2\x80\x94one of them a wind\ntunnel with a 1.5-meter test section\xe2\x80\x94formally dedicated as the Langley\nMemorial Aeronautical Laboratory (named for Samuel P. Langley,\naeronautical pioneer).\nFROM WAR TO WAR\nDuring the 1920s the new laboratory took form and substance. The\nneeded theoretical base for scientific study of aeronautics was imported\nfrom Europe, and NACA staffed the laboratory slowly and carefully.\nA conscious decision was made to concentrate on the systematic study\nof aerodynamics\xe2\x80\x94the interactions between the three-dimensional airspace and the shape and characteristics of a body moving through it\xe2\x80\x94\nas the most needed of the many areas of research in aeronautics.\nAdditional research facilities were built, carefully tailored to that purpose. Most of the credit for this hard focus and foresight should go to\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n3\n\ntwo dedicated members of the Committee\xe2\x80\x94Joseph S. Ames of Johns\nHopkins University and Jerome C. Hunsaker of the Navy\'s Bureau of\nAeronautics.\nBy the end of the decade the fledgling NACA had achieved impressive results, recognized at home and abroad. In 1929 a distinguished\nBritish engineer declared: "The only people so far who have been able\nto get at something like accurate results from wind tunnel experiments\nare the workers at the experimental station at Langley Field." In the\nsame year a British engineering journal went further:\nThey [the Langley group] were the first to establish, and Indeed to visualize, a\nvariable-density tunnel; they have led again with the construction of the\ntwenty-foot propeller research tunnel; and steps are now being taken to provide\na "full-scale" tunnel in which complete aeroplanes up to thirty-five-foot span\ncan be tested. The present-day American position in all branches of aeronautical knowledge can, without doubt, be attributed mainly to this far-seeing\npolicy and expenditure on up-to-date laboratory equipment.\n\nAmong the most important results of Langley\'s aerodynamic research with the new facilities were: the NACA cowling (1928), whose\nstreamlined shape increased aircraft speed; systematic studies of aeroLangley Laboratory\'s first wind tunnel, finished in 1920.\n\n4\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\ndynamic drag which put firm numbers on the penalties to performance\nfrom such design practices as locating engine nacelles apart from the\nwings or fuselage instead of merging them into the structure (1930);\nand the penalties of using fixed, exposed landing gear instead of retracting the wheels into the structure (1929).\nIn Washington the 1920s saw the main Committee and its technical subcommittees become established as the most knowledgeable\nsource of advice on aeronautics in the country and the clearinghouse\nfor exchange of information. Much of this sure rise to ascendency in\nU.S. aeronautical research derived from the selection of George W.\nLewis, professor of mechanical engineering at Swarthmore College, as\nDirector of Aeronautical Research. Joining NAG A in 1919, Dr. Lewis\nfor the next 26 years planned the research program, apportioned the\nmoney, and hired and trained the people in NACA.\nThe great depression that swept the United States in 1929 proved\na boon to NACA in at least two senses: First, additional research facilities could be constructed at low depression prices with money already\nappropriated (mostly pump-priming money from the Public Works\nAdministration); second, government salaries and the up-to-date reThe full-scale wind tunnel at Langley, completed in 1931.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n5\n\nsearch facilities suddenly were very attractive to promising young engineers. Thus, in 1931, the 9-meter by 18-meter "full scale" wind tunnel,\nthen the largest in the world, was completed at a cost of $900000;\nthe 610-meter-long towing tunnel was also finished that year. More\nwind tunnels were added in the mid-30s, and from a total staff of 181\npeople in 1930, NACA grew to 523 by 1939. Painstakingly and systematically the researchers charted out the family of NACA wing shapes\nthat would shortly lift military and civil aircraft all over the world.\nAs aircraft speeds rose, new aerodynamic problems had to be solved.\nStalls and spins, treacherous problems that had caused a fourth of all\naircraft accidents, were explored, understood, and largely countered.\nBy 1936 NACA officials became aware of two interconnected\nproblems looming on the horizon: (1) European nations were again\nrapidly building new research facilities; (2) room for growth was\nlimited at Langley. Once more American leadership in aeronautics was\nchallenged to expand its research base. As more evidence came in, the\nconcern became alarm. In 1938, a special committee on expanded\nPart of the extensive research facilities of the Langley Research\nCenter, 1967.\n\n6\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nfacilities was formed, and it recommended the immediate creation of\na second aeronautical research center, this one in California. The new\nlaboratory was authorized by Congress in 1939. Less than a month\nlater, on 14 September, ground was broken at Moffett Field, a Navy\nairfield 64 kilometers (about 40 miles) south of San Francisco, for\nwhat would become the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory (named after\nJoseph S. Ames, President of Johns Hopkins University, charter member\nand from 1927 to 1939 the dedicated chairman of NACA). The most\nimpressive physical structure was the huge 18-meter by 24-meter wind\ntunnel, which dwarfed its parent "full-scale" tunnel at Langley. Also\na beginning was made on an impressive array of high-speed research\nfacilities.\nBut this was not enough; the war had begun in Europe on 1 September. On 19 October 1939, a second special committee, this one\nheaded by Charles A. Lindbergh who had annually surveyed European\naviation progress for the Army Air Corps, urgently recommended the\nbuilding of a third laboratory, this one to specialize in research on airAmes Research Center, 1970. The big 40-x-80-foot wind tunnel is\nhoused in the large building on the left.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\ncraft power plants. In June 1940 Congress agreed. A site was made\navailable at the Cleveland, Ohio, municipal airport, and construction\nbegan on facilities to develop and test aircraft piston engines and their\ncomponents, study fuels and combustion, and perform research in\nfundamental physics, chemistry, and metallurgy of power plants. In\n1943 research would belatedly begin on jet engines. After Dr. Lewis\'s\ndeath in 1948, the new facility was named the Lewis Flight Propulsion\nLaboratory. Wartime expansion came to Langley too; the War Department bought more acreage and NACA expanded into a west area with\nadditional facilities that doubled the research capability.\nWorld War II dramatically changed NACA\xe2\x80\x94and aviation. For\nNACA it meant a drastic shift in both the nature and the size of its\nworkload. For aviation it meant a big surge in speed and altitude of\ncombat aircraft. NACA turned its attention to the short-term urgencies\nof finding practical fixes for problems in military aircraft already in\nproduction or on the drawing boards. The rapid increase in performance and the punishing demands of combat flying had also generated\nLewis Research Center, 1963. The laboratory is clustered on the\nnear side of the Cleveland Airport.\n\n8\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nor exaggerated a host of aerodynamic and structural problems. The\nworkload was overwhelming. From 1941 through 1944 the NACA\nlaboratories worked on 115 different airplane types. But results were\nquietly spectacular; fighter aircraft speeds and altitudes were increased,\nbuffeting and stalls were cured, the tail design of the B-29 was saved\nfrom a dangerous weakness. The number of NACA personnel rose\n13-fold from the 1939 figure, to 6800, and cadres from the Langley\nmother laboratory served as the administrative and research cores at\nthe two new laboratories.\nIn the midst of expanding from one to three laboratories, NACA\'s\nwork was effective. "The Navy\'s famous fighters\xe2\x80\x94the Corsair, Wildcat,\nand Hellcat\xe2\x80\x94are possible only because they were based on fundamentals developed by the NACA," Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox\nvolunteered in 1943. "All of them use NACA wing sections, NACA\ncooling methods, NACA high-lift devices. The great sea victories that\nhave broken Japan\'s expanding grip in the Pacific would not have been\npossible without the contributions of the NACA."\nNEW HORIZONS\nTo the scientific community, the most exciting legacy of World\nWar II was a glittering array of new technologies spawned by the\nmassive war effort. Atomic energy, radar, antibiotics, the large rocket,\nradio telemetry, the computer, and the jet engine were war babies,\nlustily crying for expanded roles in the postwar world. The atomic age,\nthe jet age, and the space age were at hand. They would shape the\nworld\'s destiny in the next three decades, and heavily influence the\nrest of the century.\nThe world\'s political order had been drastically altered by the war.\nMuch of Europe and Asia was in ashes. Old empires had crumbled;\nnational economies were tottering perilously. Astride opposite sides of\nthe world, towering like Colossi, stood the United States and the Soviet\nUnion, newly made into superpowers. It soon became apparent that\nthey would test each other\'s mettle many times before a balance of\npower stabilized. And each nation moved quickly to exploit the new\ntechnologies.\nThe atomic bomb was the most obvious and most immediately\nthreatening technological change from World War II. Both superpowers sought the best strategic systems that could deliver the bomb\nacross the intercontinental distances that separated them. Jet-powered\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n9\n\nbombers were an obvious extension of the wartime B-17 and B-29, and\nboth nations began designing and building them. The intercontinental\nrocket held great theoretical promise but seemed much farther down\nthe technological road. Atomic bombs were bulky and heavy; a rocket\nto lift such a payload would be enormous in size and expense. The\nSoviet Union doggedly went ahead with attempts to build such rockets.\nThe American military temporarily settled upon jet aircraft and smaller\nresearch and battlefield rockets. The Army imported Wernher von\nBraun and the German scientists who had created the wartime V-l\nand V-2 rockets, and set them to overseeing the refurbishing and\nlaunching of V-2s at White Sands, New Mexico. With its contractor\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Army developed a series of battlefield missiles known as Corporal, Sergeant, and Redstone. The Navy\ndesigned and built the Viking research rockets. The freshly independent\nAir Force started a family of cruise missiles, from the jet Bomarc and\nMatador battlefield missiles to Snark and the ambitious rocket-propelled\nNavaho, which were intended as intercontinental weapons.\nBy 1951 progress on a thermonuclear bomb revived interest in the\nlong-range ballistic missile. Two months before President Truman announced that the United States would develop the thermonuclear\nbomb, the Air Force contracted with Consolidated Vultee Aircraft\nCorporation (later Convair) to resume study, and then to develop, the\nAtlas intercontinental ballistic missile, a project that had been dormant\nfor four years. During the next four years three intermediate range\nmissiles\xe2\x80\x94the Army\'s Jupiter, the Navy\'s Polaris, and the Air Force\'s\nThor\xe2\x80\x94and a second generation ICBM, the Air Force\'s Titan, had been\nadded to the list of American rocket projects. All were accorded top\nnational priority. Fiscal Year 1953 saw the Department of Defense\nfor the first time spend more than $1 million on missile research,\ndevelopment, and procurement. Fiscal Year 1957 saw the amount go\nover the $1 billion mark.\nThe new postwar technologies were also having a dramatic effect\non NACA. The swift rise of aircraft speeds and altitudes during the\nwar had consumed the technological data base that NACA had so\nlaboriously created in the 1930s. And now the jet engine, still in its\ninfancy, portended another big surge in aircraft speed. Ahead lay the\nmysteries of the sound barrier, where strange things happened to fighter\nplanes. Planes had crashed, men had died; by 1945 the need for information was urgent. In that year study began on a series of new\nwind tunnels; after many ups and downs the Unitary Plan was passed\n\n10\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nby Congress in 1949. It allotted $75 million to NACA for new wind\ntunnels and started a wind-tunnel center (Arnold Engineering Development Center) for the Air Force.\nBut aerodynamic research faced serious physical obstacles. The\nwind tunnel, NACA\'s principal tool for aerodynamic research, yielded\naccurate data for subsonic and supersonic speeds but at transonic\nspeeds (Mach 0.9 to 1.1) suffered a "choking" effect that garbled the\ndata. Until this problem was remedied\xe2\x80\x94if it could be remedied\xe2\x80\x94other\nmeans had to be devised. In 1943 NACA took steps to meet the\nchallenge.\nThe short-term effort involved flying test models to high altitudes\nin aircraft and dropping them, gathering flight data during their\nballistic fall. This was only partially successful, since radar and telemetry were too primitive to return sophisticated data. Also the objects\nseldom exceeded Mach 1. The next step in this direction was to use\nrockets as motive power to launch models to transonic and supersonic\nspeeds. Langley acquired a surplus naval station on Wallops Island,\nVirginia, for this purpose. It was called the Pilotless Aircraft Research\nDivision. Later it became the Wallops Flight Center.\nWallops Flight Center\'s "little missile row" on the beach of Wallops\nIsland, Va., from which sounding rockets and small satellites are\nlaunched.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n11\n\nThe long-term measure was to plan and operate, in concert with\nthe Air Corps and the Navy, the first of what was to become a highly\nsuccessful series of special research aircraft. NACA\'s High-Speed Flight\nResearch Station was established at Edwards, California, on Muroc Dry\nLake. On 14 October 1947, Air Force Capt. Charles E. Yeager flew\nthe X-l aircraft faster than the speed of sound. The dreaded sound\nbarrier was breached. On 20 November 1953, NACA\'s Scott Crossfield in the D-558-2 reached Mach 2. The X-1A, the X-2, the X-15\xe2\x80\x94\nfaster and higher they flew, peaking at Mach 6 (7272 kilometers per\nhour) in speed and 108 000 meters in altitude. Over a span of 22 years\nand more than 700 flights, the specially built research aircraft perilously,\nmeticulously filled in the flight envelope for transonic and supersonic\nflight and provided the design data for generations of post-World War\nII military aircraft.\nMeanwhile researchers at Langley had worked away at the intransigent transonic wind tunnels and by late 1950 John Stack and his team\nhad come up with the answer\xe2\x80\x94the "slotted throat," which eliminated\nthe choking at or near the speed of sound and made the transonic tunnel\nan effective research tool. Within a year it had proved its worth;\nRichard Whitcomb discovered the "area rule," a subtle balancing of\nthe volume of fuselage and wings which produced the minimum-drag\naircraft at transonic speeds. Quickly applied to military fighters already\nin design and construction, it enabled them to be the first fighters to\nbreak the sound barrier in level flight.\nBy the mid-1950s NACA had modern research facilities that had\ncost a total of $300 million, a staff totaling 7200. With each passing\nyear it was enlarging its missile research in proportion to the old mission\nof aerodynamic research. Major NACA contributions to the military\nmissile programs came in 1955-1957. Materials research led by Robert\nR. Gilruth at Langley confirmed ablation as the means of controlling\nthe intense heat generated by warheads and other bodies reentering\nthe Earth\'s atmosphere; H. Julian Allen at Ames demonstrated the\nblunt body shape as the most effective design for reentering bodies;\nand Alfred J. Eggers at Ames did significant work on the mechanics\nof ballistic reentry.\nThe mid-1950s saw America\'s infant space program burgeoning\nwith promise and projects. As part of the U.S. participation in the\nforthcoming International Geophysical Year, it was proposed to launch\na small satellite into orbit around the Earth. After a spirited design\ncompetition between the National Academy of Sciences-Navy proposal\n\n12\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\n(Vanguard) and the Army-Jet Propulsion Laboratory candidate\n(Explorer), the Navy design was chosen in September 1955 as (1)\nnot interfering with the high-priority military missile programs, since\nit would use a new booster based on the Viking research rocket; and\n(2) having a better tracking system and more scientific growth potential. By 1957 Vanguard was readying its first test vehicles for firing.\nThe U.S.S.R. had also announced it would have an IGY satellite; the\nspace race was extending beyond boosters to payloads.\nOn the military front, space activity was almost bewildering. The\nmissiles were moving toward the critical flight-test phase. Satellite ideas\nwere proliferating, though mostly on a sub rosa planning basis; after\nSputnik these would become Tiros, weather satellite; Transit, navigation satellite; Samos, reconnaissance satellite; Midas, missile earlywarning satellite; Pioneer lunar probes; Discoverer research satellites.\nPayload size and weight were constant problems in all these concepts,\nwith the limited thrust of the early rocket engines. Here the rapid\nadvances in solid-state electronics came to the rescue by reducing\nvolume and weight; with new techniques such as printed circuitry\nand transistors, the design engineers could achieve new levels of\nFlight Research Center, 1967. At upper left is seen the edge of\nMuroc Dry Lake, whose rock-hard flat surface serves as the flight-test\nrunway. In 1976, the center was renamed the Dryden Flight Research\nCenter.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n13\n\nThe X-l, first aircraft to fly faster than the speed of sound in level\nflight.\n\nThe X-15, which crowned the achievements of the research aircraft\nprogram with speeds over 7200 kilometers per hour and altitudes above\n108 000 meters.\n\n14\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nminiaturization of equipment. Even so, heavier payloads were obviously\nin the offing; more powerful engines had to be developed. So design\nwas begun for several larger engines, topped by the monster F-l engine,\nintended to produce 4450 kilonewtons of thrust\xe2\x80\x94eight times the power\nof the engines that lifted the Atlas, Thor, and Jupiter missiles.\nAll this activity, however, was still on the drawing board, work\nbench, or test stand on 4 October 1957, when the "beep, beep" signal\nfrom Sputnik I was heard around the world. The Soviet Union had\norbited the world\'s first artificial satellite.\nThe American public\'s response to Sputnik was swift and widespread. It seemed equally compounded of alarm and chagrin. Our\ncomplacent certainty that this nation was always number one in technology had been rudely shattered. Not only had the Russians been\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94although that was bad enough\xe2\x80\x94but Sputnik weighed an impressive 83 kilograms against Vanguard\'s intended start at 1.4 kilograms\nand working up to 10 kilograms in later satellites. In a cold war\nenvironment, the contrast suggested undefined but ominous military\nimplications.\nFuel for such apprehensions added up month after month. Less\nthan one month after Sputnik I\xe2\x80\x94on 3 November\xe2\x80\x94the Russians\nlaunched Sputnik II, weighing a hefty 500 kilograms and earning a\ndog as passenger. President Eisenhower, trying to dampen the growing\nfirestorm of concern, assured the public of our as-yet-undemonstrated\nprogress and denied there was any military threat in the Russian space\nachievements. As a counter the White House announced the impending\nlaunch in December of the first Vanguard test vehicle capable of orbit\nand belatedly authorized von Braun\'s Army research team in Huntsville\nto try to launch their Explorer-Jupiter combination. But pressures for\ndramatic action gathered rapidly. The media ballyhooed the carefully\nqualified announcement on Vanguard into great expectations of\nAmerica\'s vindication. On 25 November Senator Lyndon B. Johnson,\nSenate Majority Leader, chaired the first meeting of the Senate Preparedness Investigation Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee. The hearings would review the whole spectrum of American defense and space programs.\nStill the toboggan careened downhill. On 6 December 1957, the\nmuch-touted Vanguard test vehicle rose one meter from the launch\nplatform, shuddered, and collapsed in flames. Its tiny 1.4-kilogram\npayload broke away and lay at the edge of the inferno, beeping\nimpotently.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n15\n\nClouds of gloom deepened into the new year. Then, finally, a\nsmall rift. On 31 January 1958, an American satellite at last went into\norbit. Not Vanguard but the ABMA-JPL Explorer had redeemed\nAmerican honor. True, the payload weighed only 14 kilograms against\nthe last Sputnik\'s 500. But there was a scientific first; an experiment\naboard the satellite reported mysterious saturation of its radiation\nA ball of fire and flying debris mark the explosive failure of the\nfirst American attempt to launch a satellite on Vanguard 6 December\n1957.\n\n16\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\ncounters at 965 kilometers altitude.

The Atomic Energy Commission, already\nworking with nuclear warheads and nuclear propulsion, had some\ncongressional support, particularly in the Joint Committee on Atomic\nEnergy. And there was NACA.\nNACA had devoted more and more of its facilities, budget, and\nexpertise to missile research in the mid and late 1950s. Under the\nskillful leadership of James H. Doolittle, Chairman, and Hugh L.\nDryden, Director, the strong NACA research team had come up with\na solid, long-term, scientifically based proposal for a blend of aeronautic and space research. Its concept for manned spaceflight, for\nexample, envisioned a ballistic-shaped spacecraft with a blunt reentry\nshape, backed by a world-encircling tracking system, and equipped with\ndual automatic and manual controls that would enable the astronaut\ngradually to take over more and more of the flying of his spacecraft.\nAlso NACA offered reassuring experience of long, close working relationships with the military services in solving their research problems,\nwhile at the same time translating the research into civil applications.\nBut NACA\'s greatest political asset was its peaceful, research-oriented\nimage. President Eisenhower and Senator Johnson and others in Congress were united in wanting above all to avoid projecting cold-war\ntensions into the new arena of outer space.\nBy March 1958 the consensus in Washington had jelled. The\nAdministration position\xe2\x80\x94largely authored by James R. Killian, in the\nnew post of President\'s Special Assistant for Science and Technology\xe2\x80\x94\nthe findings of Johnson\'s Senate Preparedness Subcommittee, and the\nNACA proposal converged. America needed a national space program.\nThe military component would of course be under DoD. But a civil\ncomponent, lodged in a new agency, technologically and scientifically\nbased, would pick up certain of the existing space projects and forge\nan expanded program of space exploration in close concert with the\nmilitary. All these concepts fed into draft legislation. On 2 April 1958,\nthe Administration bill for establishing a National Aeronautics and\nSpace Agency was submitted to Congress; both Houses had already\nestablished select space committees; debate ensued, a number of refinements were introduced, mostly by Senator Johnson; and on 29 July\n\n18\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\n1958 President Eisenhower signed into law P.L. 85-568, the National\nAeronautics and Space Act of 1958.\nThe act established a broad charter for civilian aeronautical and\nspace research, with unique requirements for dissemination of information; absorbed the existing NACA into the new organization as its\nnucleus; and empowered broad transfers from other government programs. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration came into\nbeing on 1 October 1958.\nAll this made for a very busy spring and summer for the people\nin the small NACA Headquarters in Washington. First the space\nprogram effort, then the legislative effort. Once the general outlines of\nthe new organization were clear, both a space program and a new\norganization had to be charted. In April Dryden brought Abe Silverstein, Assistant Director of Lewis Laboratory, to Washington to head\nthe program planning. Ira Abbott, NACA Assistant Director for Aerodynamic Research, headed a committee to plan the new organization.\nNASA\'s first high command. Hugh L. Dryden is presented his commission as Deputy Administrator by President Dwight D. Eisenhower\nwith T. Keith Glennan, Administrator, looking on.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n19\n\nGoddard Space Flight Center, 1967. This is the main NASA center\nfor the design and operation of scientific satellites.\nIn August President Eisenhower nominated T. Keith Glennan, President of Case Institute of Technology and former Commissioner of the\nAtomic Energy Commission, to be the first Administrator of the new\norganization, NASA, and Dryden to be Deputy Administrator. Quicklyconfirmed by the Senate, they were sworn in on 19 August. Glennan\nreviewed the planning efforts, approved most. Talks with the Advanced\nResearch Projects Agency ( A R P A ) identified the military space programs that were space-science oriented and obvious transfers to the\nnew agency. Plans were formulated for building a new center for space\nscience research, satellite development, flight operations, and tracking.\nA site was chosen\xe2\x80\x94two square kilometers of the Department of Agriculture\'s research center in Beltsville, Maryland. In March 1961 the\nRobert H. Goddard Space Flight Center (named for America\'s rocket\npioneer) was dedicated.\n\nII\nThe New Space Program\nOn 1 October 1958, the 170 people in Headquarters gathered in\nthe courtyard of their building, the Dolley Madison House, to hear\nGlennan proclaim the end of the 43-year-old NACA and the beginning\nof NASA. The 8000 people, three laboratories (now renamed Research\nCenters) and two stations, with a total facilities value of $300 million\nand the annual budget of $100 million, were transferred intact to NASA.\nOn the same day, by Executive Order the President transferred to\nNASA Project Vanguard, its 150-person staff, and remaining budget\nfrom the Naval Research Laboratory; lunar probes from the Army;\nlunar probes and rocket engine programs, including the F-l, from the\nAir Force; and a total of over $ 100 million of unexpended funds. NASA\nimmediately delegated operational control of these projects back to the\nDoD agencies while it put its own house in order.\nThere followed an intense two-year period of organization,\nbuild-up, fill-in, planning, and general catch-up. Only one week after\nNASA was formed, Glennan gave the go-ahead to Project Mercury,\nAmerica\'s first manned space flight. The Space Task Group, headed by\nRobert R. Gilruth, was established at Langley to get the job done. The\nnew programs brought into the organization were slowly integrated into\nthe NACA nucleus. Many space-minded specialists were drawn into\nNASA, attracted by the exciting new vistas. Long-range planning was\naccelerated; the first NASA Ten Year Plan was presented to Congress\nin February 1960. It called for an expanding program on a broad\nfront: manned flight, first orbital, then circumlunar; scientific satellites\nto measure radiation and other features of the near-space environment;\nlunar probes to measure the lunar space environment and to photograph\nthe Moon; planetary probes to measure and to photograph Mars and\nVenus; weather satellites to improve our knowledge of the Earth\'s broad\nweather patterns; continued aeronautical research; and development\n21\n\nPAGE BLANK NOT FILMED!\n\n22\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nof larger launch vehicles for lifting heavier payloads. Cost of the program\nwas expected to vary between $1 billion and $1.5 billion a year over the\n10-year period.\nIf NASA was to conduct such a program, it obviously needed\ncapabilities it did not have. To that end Glennan sought to acquire the\nsuccessful Army team that had launched America\'s first satellite\xe2\x80\x94the\nArmy Ballistic Missile Agency at Huntsville, Alabama, and its contractor, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The\nArmy balked at losing the Huntsville group, claiming it was indispensible to the Army\'s military rocket program. Glennan for the time being\nhad to compromise: ABMA would do work on NASA programs as\nrequested. The Army grudgingly gave up JPL. On 3 December 1958,\nan Executive Order transferred, effective 31 December, the government-owned plant of JPL and the Army contract with the California\nInstitute of Technology, under which JPL was staffed and operated.\nGlennan renewed his bid for ABMA in 1959; protracted Army resistance\nwas finally overcome and on 15 March 1960 ABMA\'s 4000-man\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, 1963. This contract facility has been\nthe mainstay of NASA\'s lunar and planetary programs.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n23\n\nDevelopment Operations Division, headed by Wernher von Braun,\nwas transferred to NASA along with the big Saturn booster project.\nAs the Ten Year Plan took shape and the capability grew, there\nwere many other gaps to be filled. NASA was going to be markedly\ndifferent from NACA in two important ways. First, it was going to be\noperational as well as R&D. That is, it would not only design and build\nMarshall Space Flight Center, 1965, where a ground test model of\nthe first stage of Saturn V was being hoisted onto the test stand.\n\n24\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nlaunch vehicles and satellites but it would launch them, operate them,\ntrack them, acquire data from them, and interpret the data. Second,\nit would do the greater part of its work by contract rather than inhouse\nas NACA had done. The first of these required tracking sites in many\ncountries around the world, as well as construction of tracking facilities\n\xe2\x80\x94antennas, telemetry equipment, computers, radio and landline communications networks, etc. The second required the development of a\nlarger and more sophisticated contracting operation than NACA had\nneeded. In the first years, NASA leaned heavily on DoD for contracting\nassistance. Since its industrial contractors would be the same aerospace\nfirms who were already doing extensive business with DoD, this was\npractical and workable, especially since NASA adopted most of the\nDoD procurement system.\nThe problem of launch vehicles occupied much attention in these\nfirst years. A family of existing and future launch vehicles had to be\nstructured for the kinds of missions and spacecraft enumerated in the\nplan. In addition to the existing Redstone, Thor, and Atlas vehicles,\nNASA would develop\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Scout, a low-budget solid-propellant booster that could put\nsmall payloads in orbit;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Centaur, a liquid-hydrogen-fueled upper stage, transferred from\nThe worldwide satellite tracking network, 1974.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SPACEFLIGHT TRACKING & DATA NETWORK\nSTDNj FACILITIES\nA DEEP SPACE NETWORK |DSN] FACILITIES\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n25\n\nDoD, that promised higher thrust and bigger payloads for lunar\nand planetary missions;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Saturn, which was expected to be flying in 1963 (with the\nproper upper stages it would put upwards of 23 000 kilograms\nin Earth orbit);\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Nova, several times the size of Saturn, to be started later in the\ndecade for the more ambitious manned lunar flights anticipated\nin the 1970s.\nIn addition, work would continue with the Atomic Energy Commission\non the difficult but enormously promising nuclear-propelled upper\nstage, Nerva, and on the Snap family of long-life power producers.\nAs much as larger boosters were needed, an even more immediate\nproblem was how to improve the reliability of the existing boosters.\nBy December 1959 the United States had attempted 37 satellite\nlaunches; less than one third attained orbit. Electrical components,\nvalves, turbopumps, welds, materials, structures\xe2\x80\x94virtually everything\nthat went into the intricate mechanism called a booster\xe2\x80\x94had to be\nredesigned or strengthened or improved to withstand the stresses of\nlaunch. A new order of perfection in manufacturing and assembly\nhad to be instilled in workmen and managers. Rigorous, repeated\ntesting had to verify each component, then subassembly, then total\nvehicle. That bugaboo of the engineering profession\xe2\x80\x94constant fiddling\nand changing in search of perfection\xe2\x80\x94had to be harnessed to a compromise of reliability. And since the existing vehicles were DoD products,\nNASA had to persuade DoD to enforce these rigorous standards on its\ncontractors.\nThat was only one of the areas in which close coordination between\nNASA and DoD was essential and effective. In manned spaceflight,\nfor example, there were essentially four approaches to putting man into\nspace:\n(1) the research airplane\xe2\x80\x94the Air Force and NASA were already\nwell into this program, leading to the X-15;\n(2) the ballistic vehicle\xe2\x80\x94NASA\'s Project Mercury embodied this\napproach, with Air Force launch vehicles and DoD support\nthroughout;\n(3) the boost-glider\xe2\x80\x94the Air Force had inaugurated the DynaSoar project (later renamed the X-20) in November 1957.\nA manned glider would be boosted into shallow Earth orbit,\nbounce in and out of the top of the Earth\'s atmosphere for\n\n26\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\npart or all of a revolution of the Earth, and land like an airplane. In May 1958 NACA had agreed to help with the\ntechnical side of the project; NASA continued that support;\n(4) the lifting body\xe2\x80\x94a bathtub-like shape proposed by Alfred J.\nEggers of Ames Laboratory; as a reentry shape it would be\nmidway between an airplane configuration and the ballistic\nshape, developing moderate lift during reentry and landing\nlike an airplane. This approach would be deferred for a few\nyears before being explored by the Air Force and NASA.\nIn another area, communications satellites, DoD had its Courier\nprogram, a low-altitude, militarily secure communications satellite; it\nalso had Advent, intended to be put into equatorial synchronous orbit\nby the Atlas-Centaur booster and provide global communications for\nthe military. NASA had a passive communications satellite, Echo, a\n30-meter inflatable sphere from which to bounce radar signals as a\nlimited communications relay and, over a period of time and with\naccurate tracking, to plot the variations in air density at the top of\nthe atmosphere by following the vagaries of its orbit. It had been agreed\nthat NASA would leave active communications satellites\xe2\x80\x94those that\npicked up, amplified, and rebroadcast radio signals from one point on\nEarth to another\xe2\x80\x94to DoD. But this did not answer for long, By 1960\nthe American Telephone and Telegraph Company was asking NASA to\nlaunch its low-level, active communications satellite, Telstar. NASA also\nhad another proposal for medium altitude (roughly 17900-kilometer\norbit) communications satellites.\nThe AT&T proposal raised a fundamental problem: would\nindustry develop communications satellites entirely with its own money\nor would the government fund its own research? NASA sought and\nreceived presidential approval to go both ways\xe2\x80\x94to provide reimbursable\nlaunches to industry and to do its own communications satellite research.\nFirst there was Relay, the medium-altitude repeater satellite. Beyond\nlay the imaginative proposal from Hughes Aircraft Company for\nSyncom, a synchronous-orbit satellite\xe2\x80\x94one that would fly at 35 000kilometer altitude, where distance, gravity, and velocity combined to\nplace a satellite permanently over the same spot on Earth; by virtue of\nthe lofty orbit, three of these satellites could cover the entire Earth\nand require only a handful of ground stations.\nBy the time of the presidential election of 1960 the worst pangs of\nreorganization, absorption, redefinition, and planning were over. Pro-\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n27\n\ngrams were meshing with each other; contracting for large projects\nwas becoming routine; the initial absorption of DoD programs had been\ncompleted; and a viable organization was in business.\nThere were operational bright spots as well. True, launch vehicles\nwere still fickle and unpredictable\xe2\x80\x947 out of 17 launches failed in 1959.\nBut finally in August 1959, NASA launched its first satellite that functioned in all respects (Explorer VI); Pioneer V, launched on 11 March\n1960 and intended to explore interplanetary space between Earth\nand Venus, communicated out to a new distance record, 35.7 million\nkilometers; the first of the prototype weather satellites, Tiros I, launched\non 1 April 1960, produced 22 500 photos of Earth\'s weather; Echo 1,\nthe first passive communications satellite, was launched 12 August 1960,\ninflated in orbit, and provided a passive target for bouncing long-range\ncommunications from one point on Earth to another. Perhaps as\nimportant, millions of people saw in the night sky the moving pinpoint\nof light that was Echo and were awed by the experience.\n\nday.\n\nAn early Tiros weather photo of the Great Lakes area on a wintry\n\n28\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nIn late 1960 politics bemused the space program. Although not a\ndirect campaign issue in the presidential campaign, the space program\nfound little reassurance of its priority as an expensive new item in the\nFederal budget. After John F. Kennedy was narrowly elected, the\nuncertainty deepened. Jerome B. Wiesner, the President-elect\'s science\nadviser, chaired a committee which produced a report both critical of the\nspace program\'s progress to date and skeptical of its future. Who would\nbe the new Administrator? What, if any, priority would the fledgling\nspace program have in a new, on-record-hostile administration?\nThen, once again, challenge and response. On 12 April 1961,\nSoviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin rode Vostokl into a 301-by-174-kilometer orbit of the Earth. After one orbit he reentered the atmosphere and\nlanded safely. Man had flown in space. Gagarin joined that elite pantheon of men who were the first to do the undoable\xe2\x80\x94the Wright\nbrothers, Lindbergh, now Gagarin. There was faint consolation on\n5 May 1961, when Mercury essayed its first manned space flight.\nAstronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., rode a Redstone booster in his Freedom\n7 Mercury spacecraft for a 15-minute suborbital flight and was picked\nout of the water 487 kilometers downrange. Success, yes; a good beginning, yes. But Gagarin had flown around the Earth\xe2\x80\x9440 000 kilometers\nagainst Shepard\'s 487. His Vostok weighed 4730 kilograms in orbit,\ncontrasting with Mercury\'s 953 kilograms in suborbit. Gagarin had had\nabout 89 minutes in weightlessness\xe2\x80\x94the mysterious zero-gravity condition which had supplanted the sound barrier as the great unknown.\nShepard experienced five minutes of weightlessness. By any unit of\nmeasurement, the United States was clearly still behind, especially in the\nindispensable prerequisite of rocket power. The new President could only\nsay, gloomily: "We are behind . . . . the news will be worse before it is\nbetter, and it will be some time before we catch up."\nThe public reaction was less emphatic than after Sputnik I but\ncongressional concern was strong. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA\'s\nAssociate Administrator and general manager, was hard put to restrain\nCongress from forcing more money on NASA than could be effectively\nused.\nPresident Kennedy was especially concerned. His Inaugural\nAddress in January had rung with an eloquent promise of bold new\ninitiatives that would "get this country moving again." The succeeding\nthree months had been distinguished by crushing setbacks\xe2\x80\x94the Bay of\nPigs invasion fiasco and the Gagarin flight. As one of several searches\nfor new initiative, the President asked his Vice President, Lyndon B.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n29\n\nJohnson, to head a study of what would be required in the space program to convincingly surpass the Soviets. Johnson, the only senior White\nHouse figure in the new Administration with prior commitment to the\nspace program, found strong support waiting in the wings. James E.\nWebb, new Administrator of NASA, had an established reputation as\nan aggressive manager of large enterprise, both in industry and in the\nTruman Administration as Director of the Bureau of the Budget and\nUndersecretary of State. Backed by the seasoned technical judgment\nof Dryden, his deputy, and Seamans, his general manager, Webb\nmoved vigorously to accelerate and expand the central elements of the\nNASA Ten Year Plan.\nThe largest single concept in that plan had been manned circumlunar flight. Now the question became: could this country rally quickly\nenough to beat the Soviets to that circumlunar goal? The considered\ntechnical estimate was: not for sure. But if we went one large step\nfurther and escalated the commitment to manned lunar landing and\nreturn, it became a new ball game. Both nations would have to design\nand construct a whole new family of boosters and spacecraft; this would\nbe an equalizer in terms of challenge to both nations and the experts\nwere confident that the depth and competence of the American government-industry-university team would prove superior. In this judgment\nthey found a strong ally in the new Secretary of Defense, Robert S.\nMcNamara.\nBut Webb and his advisers were not content with a one-shot objective. The goal, they said, was a major space advance on a broad front\n\xe2\x80\x94manned space flight, yes, but also boosters, communications satellites,\nmeteorological satellites, scientific satellites, planetary exploration.\nThis was the combined proposal presented to the Vice President\nand approved and transmitted by him to the President. It was the\nbest new initiative the President had seen. So it was that on 25 May\n1961 the President stood before a joint session of Congress and proposed\na historic national goal:\nNow is the time to take longer strides\xe2\x80\x94time for a great new American enterprise\xe2\x80\x94time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement,\nwhich in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth. . . .\nI believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this\ndecade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the\nEarth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none\nwill be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.\n\n30\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nThe President correctly assessed the national mood. Editorial\nsupport was widespread. Congressional debate was perfunctory, given\nthe size of the commitment. The decision to land a man on the Moon\nwas endorsed virtually without dissent.\nTHE LUNAR COMMITMENT\nNASA was exhilarated but awed. Dryden had returned from a\nWhite House meeting to tell his staff that "this man" [Webb] had sold\nthe President on landing a man on the Moon. Gilruth, immersed in\nwhat seemed to be big enough problems in the relatively modest Project\nMercury, was temporarily aghast. But the die was cast. The nation had\naccepted the challenge to its largest technological enterprise, dwarfing\neven the wartime Manhattan Project for developing the atomic bomb\nand the postwar crash development of strategic missiles.\nThe blank check was there; the way to use it was far from clear.\nSince 1958, studies had been underway on a circumlunar manned\nflight. Since 1959, George M. Low, head of the manned space flight\noffice in Headquarters, had ramrodded a series of progressively more\ndetailed studies on the requirements for a manned lunar landing on\nthe Moon. Those studies had established a broad confidence that no\nmajor technological or scientific breakthroughs were needed to get a\nman to the Moon or even to land and return him. But there were some\noperational unknowns; the blank check caused them suddenly to\nloom larger:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 the earlier assumption had been that one simply built a big\nenough booster, flew directly to the Moon, landed a large vehicle\non the lunar surface, and returned some part of it directly to\nEarth. But there were wide scientific disagreements as to the\nnature of the lunar surface. Was it solid "ground," strong enough\nto support such a load? Or was it many feet of dust, in which a\nspacecraft would disappear without a trace? Or was it something in between? There were operational problems too: could\nthe crew and ground control possibly handle the enormous\npeak of work that would bunch together in the landing phase\nof a direct-ascent mission?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 the early alternative seemed to be that one boosted pieces of a\nlunar vehicle into Earth orbit, assembled and refueled them\nthere, and took off for a direct landing on the Moon. This too\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n31\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy on 25 May 1961 recommended to a\njoint session of Congress that the United States undertake the challenge\nof landing men on the Moon and returning them to Earth in the decade\nof the 1960s.\nwas fraught with hazards: could payloads rendezvous in Earth\norbit? Could men assemble complex equipment in the demanding\nenvironment of space? Could such operations as refueling with\nvolatile fuels\xe2\x80\x94hazardous enough on Earth\xe2\x80\x94be safely performed\nin space?\nSome points were clear. The very massiveness of the effort would\nmake this program different in kind from anything NASA had\nattempted. New organizational modes were essential; no one center\ncould handle this program. A much stronger Headquarters team would\nbe needed, coordinating the efforts of several centers and riding herd\non an enormous mobilization of American industry and university effort.\nAlso, there were long-lead-time problems that needed to be worked\non irrespective of later decisions. One of these was three years under way\n\xe2\x80\x94a big engine. Work on the 4400-kilonewton-thrust F-l engine would\nbe accelerated. Another was a navigation system; accurate vectoring\n\n32\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nof a spacecraft from Earth to a precise point on a rapidly moving Moon\n370 000 kilometers away was a formidable problem in celestial\nmechanics. Therefore the first large Apollo contract was let to the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology and its Instrumentation Laboratory, headed by C. Stark Draper, to begin study of this inscrutable problem and to develop the requisite navigational system.\nThe basic spacecraft could be delineated\xe2\x80\x94the one in which a crew\nwould depart the Earth, travel to the Moon, and return. And, building\non Gemini design, it should have a baggage car\xe2\x80\x94a jettisonable service\nmodule housing the propulsion, expendable oxygen, etc. The Space\nTask Group was hard at work on these with its left hand, while its main\neffort on Mercury went forward. That left hand had to be strengthened.\nA whole new system of Earth-based logistics was needed for this\nscale of effort. From factory to launch, everything had outstripped\nnormal sizes and normal transportation. There would have to be new\nfactories, new mammoth test stands, huge launch complexes. Railroads\nand highways could not handle the larger components. Ship transportation seemed the only answer. A massive facility design and site location\nprogram had to get under way even before the final configuration of\nthe vehicle was decided. Limited in capability in the facilities and construction area, NASA decided to call on the tested resources of the Army\nCorps of Engineers. It proved to be one of the wiser decisions in this\nhectic period.\nAs planning went forward in 1961 and 1962, order gradually\nemerged. A new concept for how to get to the Moon painfully surfaced:\nlunar-orbit rendezvous. A small group at Langley, headed by John C.\nHoubolt, had studied the trade-offs of direct ascent, Earth-orbit rendezvous, and other possibilities. They had been increasingly struck\nwith the vehicle and fuel economics of this mission profile: after stabilizing in Earth orbit, a set of spacecraft went to orbit around the Moon,\nand, leaving the mother spacecraft in lunar orbit, dispatched a smaller\ncraft to land on the lunar surface, reconnoiter, and rejoin the mother\ncraft in lunar orbit for the return to Earth. Over a period of two\nyears they refined their complex mathematics and argued their case. As\ntime became critical for definition of the launch vehicle, they argued\ntheir case before one NASA audience after another. Finally Houbolt,\nin a bold move, went outside of "channels" and got the personal attention of Seamans. This was a decision of such importance to the total\nprogram that imposed decision was not enough\xe2\x80\x94the major elements\nof NASA had to be won over and concur in the final technical judgment.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n33\n\nDismissed at first as risky and very literally "far out," lunar orbit\nrendezvous gradually won adherents. In July 1962 D. Brainerd Holmes,\nNASA Director of Manned Space Flight, briefed the House space\ncommittee on lunar orbit rendezvous, the chosen method of going to\nthe Moon.\nOnce made, this decision permitted rapid definition of the Apollo\nspacecraft combination. Launch vehicle configuration had been arrived\nat seven months earlier. The objective would be to put a payload of\nnearly 136 000 kilograms in Earth orbit and 45 000 kilograms in orbit\naround the Moon. To do this required a three-stage vehicle, the first\nstage employing the F-l engine in a cluster of five, to provide 33 000\nkilonewtons of thrust at launch. The second stage would cluster five\nof a new 890-kilonewton-thrust liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen\nengine (the J-2). The third stage, powered by a single J-2 engine, would\nboost the Apollo three-man spacecraft out of Earth orbit and into the\nlunar gravitational field. At that point the residual three-spacecraft\ncombination would take over\xe2\x80\x94a Command Module housing the\nastronauts, a Service Module providing propulsion for maneuvers,\nand a two-man Lunar Module for landing on the Moon. The engine\non the Service Module would ignite to slow the spacecraft enough to\nbe captured into lunar orbit; the fragile Lunar Module would leave\nthe mother craft and descend to land its two passengers on the Moon.\nAfter lunar reconnaissance, the astronauts would blast off in the top\nhalf of the Lunar Module to rejoin the mother craft in lunar orbit,\nand the Service Module would fire up for return to Earth.\nA smaller launch vehicle, which would later be dubbed the Saturn\nIB, would be built first and used to test the Apollo spacecraft in Earth\norbit. Even this partial fulfillment of the Apollo mission would require\na first stage of 7300 kilonewtons of thrust and a high-energy liquid\noxygen-liquid hydrogen second stage.\nThe grand design was now complete. But in the articulating of it,\nvast gaps in space experience and technology were revealed. At three\ncritical points the master plan depended on successful rendezvous and\ndocking of spacecraft. Although theoretically feasible, it had never been\ndone and was not within the scope of Project Mercury. How could\npractical experience be gained with rendezvous and docking short of\nan intricate, hideously expensive, and possibly disastrous series of\nexperiments with Apollo hardware? Men would, hopefully, land and\nwalk upon the Moon. But could men and their equipment function in\nspace outside the artificial and confining environment of their space-\n\nI\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\ncraft? Other systems and other questions could be engineered to\nsolution on Earth, but the ultimate questions here could only be answered\nin space. We had bitten off more than we could chew. Clearly something was needed between the exploratory confines of Mercury and\nthe grand design of Apollo. The gap was too great to jump when\nmen\'s lives were at stake.\nEven Mercury sometimes seemed a very big mouthful to chew.\nBut slowly, stubborn problem after stubborn problem yielded. The\nsecond suborbital flight, Liberty Bell 7, was launched on 21 July 1961;\nits 16-minute flight went well, though on landing the hatch blew off\nprematurely and the spacecraft sank just after Astronaut Virgil I.\nGrissom was hoisted to safety in a rescue helicopter. In September the\nunmanned Mercury-Atlas combination was orbited successfully and\nlanded where it was supposed to, east of Bermuda. On 29 November\nthe final test flight took chimpanzee Enos on a two-orbit ride and landed\nhim in good health. The system was qualified for manned orbital\nflight. And on 20 February 1962, Astronaut John H. Glenn, Jr., became\nthe first American to orbit the Earth in space. Friendship 7 circled the\nEarth three times; Glenn flew parts of the last two orbits manually\nbecause of trouble with his autopilot.\nThe United States took its astronaut heroes to its heart with an\nenthusiasm that bewildered them and startled NASA. Their mail was\nenormous; hundreds of requests for personal appearances poured in.\nGlenn had a rainy parade in Washington and addressed a joint session\nof Congress. On 1 March four million people in New York showered\nconfetti and ticker tape on him and fellow astronauts Shepard and\nGrissom. Nor was the event unnoticed by the competition. President\nKennedy announced the day after the Glenn flight that Soviet Premier\nNikita Khrushchev had congratulated the nation on its achievement\nand had suggested the two nations "could work together in the exploration of space." The results of this exchange were a series of talks between\nDryden of NASA and Anatoliy A. Blagonravov of the Soviet Academy\nof Sciences. By the end of the year they had agreed to exchanges of\nmeteorological and magnetic field data and some communications\nexperiments.\nA big year for the young American space program, 1962. Two more\nMercury flights, Carpenter for three orbits, then Schirra for six. The\npowerful Saturn booster made its first two test flights, both successful.\nThe first active communications satellite, Telstar I, was launched for\nAT&T bv NASA; later NASA\'s own Relav communications satellite\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\nif)\n\nwas orbited; and the first international satellite, Britain\'s Ariel I, was\nlaunched by NASA to take scientific measurements of the ionosphere.\nMariner II became the first satellite to fly by another planet; on 14\nDecember it passed within 34 400 kilometers of Venus and scanned the\nsurface of that cloud-shrouded body, measuring its temperatures. Then\nAstronaut John H. Glenn, Jr., aboard his Mercury spacecraft\nFriendship 7, rose off the launch pad at Cape Canaveral on 20 February 1962 to become the first American to orbit the Earth.\n\n36\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nit continued into orbit about the Sun, eventually setting a new communications distance record of 89 million kilometers. The fifth and\nsixth Tiros meteorological satellites were placed in orbit and continued to\nreport the world\'s weather. So successful had Tiros been that the R&D\nprogram had quickly become semioperational. The Weather Bureau\nwas regularly integrating Tiros data into its operational forecasting\nand was busy planning a full-scale weather satellite system which it\nwould operate. And the hard work on booster reliability began to pay\noff\xe2\x80\x9418 successes to 9 failures or partial successes.\nNot that all was sweetness and light. The Ranger, designed to\nphotograph the Moon while falling to impact the lunar surface, was\nin deep trouble. A high-technology program at the edge of the state of\nthe art, Ranger closed the year with five straight failures and another\none would come in 1963. JPL, the NASA agent; Hughes Aircraft Co.,\nthe contractor; and NASA Headquarters came under heavy pressure\nfrom Congress. Studies were made; reorganization realigned JPL\nand contractor to firm commitment to the project; NASA dropped the\nscience experiments, and the last three Ranger nights were spectacularly\nsuccessful, providing close-in lunar photography that excelled the best\ntelescopic detail of the Moon from Earth by 2000 times and dispelled\nmany of the scare theories about the lunar surface.\nAs the dimensions of Apollo began to dawn on Congress and the\nscientific community, there were rumbles: Apollo would preempt too\nmuch of the scientific manpower of the nation; Apollo was an "other\nworldly" stunt, directed at the Moon instead of at pressing problems\non Earth. Administrator Webb met both of these caveats with positive\nprograms.\nIn acknowledgment of the drain on scientific manpower, Webb\nwon White House support for a broad program by NASA to augment\nthe scientific manpower pool. Thousands of fellowships were offered for\ngraduate study in space-related disciplines, intended to replace or at least\nsupplement the kinds of talent engulfed by the space program. Complementing the fellowships was an even more innovative program\xe2\x80\x94government-financed buildings and facilities on university campuses for\nthe new kinds of interdisciplinary training that the space program\nrequired.\nFrom a modest beginning in 1962, by the end of the program in\n1970 NASA had footed the bill for the graduate education of 5000\nscientists and engineers at a cost of over $100 million, had spent\nsome $32 million in construction of new laboratory facilities on 32\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n37\n\nuniversity campuses, and had given multidisciplinary grants to some 50\nuniversities that totaled more than $50 million. The program marked\na new direction in the government\'s recognition of its responsibility for\nimpact of its program on the civilian economy and a new dimension\nof cooperation between the university and the government. In part as\na result of these new capabilities in the universities, NASA contracts\nand grants for research by universities rose from $21 million in 1962\nto $101 million in 1968. The NASA university program proved very\nRanger VII took this photograph of the lunar surface from an\naltitude of about 6 kilometers, 2.3 seconds before it crashed.

Its basic purpose\nwas to identify and hold up to the light the many items of space technology that could be or had been adapted for uses in the civilian\neconomy. By 1973 some 30 000 such uses had been identified and new\nones were rolling in at the rate of 2000 a year.\nBut the program went beyond that: a concerted effort was made\nin every NASA center not only to identify possible transfers of space\ntechnology but to use NASA technical people and contractors to explore\nThis synchrocyclotron in the Space Radiation Effects Laboratory\nis operated for NASA by the College of William and Mary, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute.

NASA\npublications described all these potential applications to researchers and\nindustry; seven regional dissemination centers were established to work\ndirectly with industry on technical problems in the adaptation of space\ntechnology; in 1973 some 2000 companies received direct help and\nanother 57 000 queries were answered. New products ranged from\nquieter aircraft engines to microminiaturized and solid-state electronics\nthat revolutionized TV sets, radios, and small electronic calculators.\nNASA\'s computer software programs enabled a wide range of manufacturers to test the life history of new systems\xe2\x80\x94see predictions of\nproblems that could develop, how the systems would perform, how\nlong they would last, etc. Many other facets of the space program\nwere important to the quality and sustenance of life for citizens of the\nUnited States and the world:\nCommunications: Within a decade the communications satellite\nproved itself to be a reliable, flexible, cost-effective addition to longrange communications. The Communications Satellite Corporation\nbecame a solid financial success, with 114 000 stockholders. As manager\nof the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium, it had\nshared access to the global satellite system with 82 other nations\nwho had become members of the Consortium. Its array of sophisticated\nIntelsat communications satellites bracketed the world from synchronous\norbit. Before these satellites existed, the world\'s total capability for\ntransoceanic telephone calls was 500 circuits; in 1973 the Intelsat satellites alone offered more than 4000 transoceanic circuits. Real-time TV\ncoverage of events anywhere in the world\xe2\x80\x94whether Olympics, wars, or\ncoronations\xe2\x80\x94had become a commonplace in the world\'s living rooms.\nSatellite data transmission enabled industries to control far-flung\nproduction and inventories, airlines to have instantaneous coast-to-coast\nreservation systems, large banks to have nationwide data networks. And\nthis communications revolution was only beginning. The next generation\nof communications satellite\xe2\x80\x94Intelsat V\xe2\x80\x94would start operations in\n1976 with five times the capacity of its predecessor Intelsat IV and a\nlife expectancy of ten years in orbit. About 1976 the Maritime Administration would embark on a global ship-control system operated by\nmeans of satellites. Experiments with ATS satellites would continue to\nrefine the life-saving biomedical communication network which links\nmedical personnel and medical centers across the nation. Especially\nvaluable to isolated and rural areas, the network would afford them\nreal-time access to expert diagnosis and prescription of treatment.\n\n40\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nWeather forecasting: Like its brother the communications satellite,\nthe weather satellite had in less than a decade become an established\nfriend of people around the world. Potentially disastrous hurricanes such\nas Camille in August 1969 and Agnes in June 1972 were spotted,\ntracked, and measured by the operational weather satellite network\nof the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nThe real-time knowledge of the storm\'s position, intensity, and track\nmade possible accurate early warning and emergency evacuation that\nsaved hundreds of lives and millions of dollars in property damage.\nNear-global rainfall maps were being produced by 1973 from data\nacquired by NASA\'s Nimbus 5. Not only did the heat-release information contained in such data markedly improve long-range weather\nforecasting but the data were of immediate value in agriculture, flood\ncontrol, etc. Ice-movement charts for the Arctic and Antarctic regions\nwere extending shipping schedules in these areas by several months\neach year.\nMedicine: NASA\'s experience in microminiaturized electronics\nand in protecting and monitoring the health of astronauts during space\nflights generated hundreds of medical devices and techniques that could\nsave lives and improve health care. Multidisciplinary teams of space\ntechnicians and medical researchers were successful in developing longduration heart pacers, for instance. Implanted in the patient\'s body but\nrechargeable from outside, the tiny pacer would regulate the patient\'s\nheartbeat for decades without replacement, whereas the previous model\nrequired surgical replacement every two years. Space-derived automatic\npatient monitoring systems were being used in more and more hospitals.\nTiny sensors on the patient\'s body would trigger an alarm when there\nwas significant change in the patient\'s temperature or heartbeat or blood\npressure or even in the oxygen-carbon dioxide levels in the blood, a\nsignal of the onset of shock. For researchers living inside space simulators\nfor long periods of time, the Ames Research Center developed an\naspirin-sized transmitter pill. In general medical practice, the transmitter\npill was swallowed by the patient; as it moved through the digestive\nsystem it radioed to the doctor diagnostic measurements of any of\nseveral kinds of deep-body conditions\xe2\x80\x94temperatures, stomach acid\nlevels, etc.\nEnergy: The nation\'s stepped-up program of energy research that\nbegan in 1973 found NASA with broad experience and an in-being\nprogram of research in devices that collect, store, transmit, and apply\nsolar, nuclear, and chemical energy for production of mechanical and\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n41\n\nelectrical power. Solar cells had produced the electric power for\nseveral generations of spacecraft; when arrays of them were experimentally mounted on houses they supplied as much as three quarters\nof the energy needed to heat and cool the house. But solar cells were\ntoo expensive to be competitive with other systems; work was continuing\non improving their efficiency and on new manufacturing techniques\nthat would cut their cost in half. A long-standing problem with the\nefficient use of electrical energy has been the inability to store significant\namounts of it for future use. NASA had done much work on developing more compact, higher-storage-capacity, longer life batteries. Nickelcadmium batteries developed for the space program were already in\ngeneral use; they could be recharged in 6 to 20 minutes instead of the\n16 to 24 hours required for conventional batteries. Silver-zinc batteries\nused in spacecraft were too expensive for commercial use, but their\nunique separator material could double the capacity of conventional\nThis laminar flow clean room and special clothing are used at\nSt. Luke\'s Hospital, Denver, Colo., to lower risk of infection in hip-joint\nreplacements and other surgical procedures.

An extensive trial of this adaptation was begun\nwith the fleet of Postal Service electric trucks. Batteries with 5 to 20\ntimes the storage capacity of conventional mass-produced automobile\nbatteries could have a wide range of uses: low-pollution automobile\npropulsion; storage of excess electrical power generated during lowdemand daylight hours, and its release at times of peak demand, etc.\nFuel cells had been developed by NASA to provide the longer duration\nGemini and Apollo flights with electrical power; on Earth they could\nbe used either for energy storage or energy conversion. One of the\ningredients used in fuel cells was hydrogen; in this application hydrogen\nwas broken down and combined with oxygen in a complex chemical\nprocess that produced water and electrical energy. But hydrogen is\nalso a superb high-performance, low-pollutant fuel whose source is\ninexhaustible. Liquid hydrogen had propelled men to and from the\nMoon. With its years of work with hydrogen as a rocket fuel, NASA\nhad more experience than anyone else in the production, transportation,\nstorage, pumping, and use of hydrogen. One possible use of hydrogen\nwas as compact, clean energy that could be transported into large\nurban areas. Many kinds of Earth-based power plants could burn\nhydrogen, alone or in various combinations, to produce energy with\nlow pollution side effects.\nAPOLLO IMPACT\nThe creation of NASA\'s university and technology transfer programs in the early 1960s could be considered a side effect of Apollo.\nThere were others. All lunar reconnaissance programs had been impacted by Apollo. The latter part of Ranger had been reoriented;\nSurveyor, the first lunar softlander, was reconfigured to support Apollo.\nIf Surveyor worked, it would provide on-the-lunar-surface photography\nplus televised digging in the surface of the Moon for a better sense\nof soil composition. The remaining problem for Apollo was the need\nfor detailed mapping photography of the Moon. So by the end of\n1963 a third program was initiated\xe2\x80\x94Lunar Orbiter, a state-of-the-art\nphotographic mapping satellite that would go into orbit around the\nMoon and take mapping photographs of the portion of the Moon that\nfeatured potential landing zones for Apollo.\nThe vexing questions of rendezvous and extravehicular activity\nstill had to be answered. So on 3 January 1962 NASA announced a\nnew manned spaceflight project, Gemini. Using the basic configuration\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n43\n\nof the Mercury capsule but scaling it up in size to hold a two-man\ncrew, Gemini was to fit between Mercury and Apollo and provide early\nanswers to assist the design work on Apollo. The launch vehicle would\nbe the Titan II missile being developed by the Air Force. More powerful than Atlas and Titan I, it would have the thrust to put the larger\nspacecraft into Earth orbit. For a target vehicle that Gemini could\nrendezvous with, NASA chose the Air Force\'s Agena; launched by an\nAtlas, the second-stage Agena had a restartable engine that enabled\nit to have both passive and active roles. Gemini would be managed by\nthe same Space Task Group that was operating Mercury; the project\ndirector would be James A. Chamberlin, an early advocate of an\nenlarged Mercury capsule.\nGemini began as a Mark II Mercury, a "quick and dirty" program. The only major engineering change aside from scale-up was to\nmodularize the various electrical and control assemblies and place them\noutside the inner shell of the spacecraft to simplify and speed up maintenance. But perhaps not an engineer alive could have left it at that.\nAfter all, Gemini was supposed to bridge to Apollo, wasn\'t it? Here\nwas a chance to try out ideas. If they worked, they would be available\nfor Apollo. There was the paraglider, for example, that Francis Rogallo\nhad been experimenting with at Langley. If that worked, Gemini\ncould forget parachutes and water landings with half the Navy out\nthere; with a paraglider Gemini could land routinely on land. And\nthe spacecraft should be designed to have more aerodynamic lift than\nMercury, so the pilot would have more landing control. And fuel cells\ninstead of batteries; with enough electric power you could have longer\nduration flights. And fighter-plane-type ejection seats for crew abort,\nsuperseding the launch escape rocket that perched on top of Mercury.\nAll these innovations were cranked into the program, and contracts and subcontracts were let for their design and fabrication. Soon\nthe monthly bills for Gemini were running far beyond what had been\nbudgeted. In every area, it seemed, there were costly problems. The\nparaglider and ejection seats wouldn\'t stabilize in flight; the fuel cell\nleaked; Titan II had longitudinal oscillations\xe2\x80\x94the dreaded "pogo"\neffect\xe2\x80\x94too severe for manned flights; Agena had reconfiguration problems. Cost overruns had become severe by late 1962; by March 1963\nthey were critical. The original program cost of $350 million had\nzoomed to over $1 billion\xe2\x80\x94$200 million higher than the figures Associate Administrator Seamans had used in Congress a few days before!\nCharles W. Mathews, the new program manager, cracked down. Flight\n\n44\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nschedules were stretched out; the paraglider gradually slid out of the\nprogram. By early 1964 most of the engineering problems were responding to treatment.\nWith the Mercury program, the spacecraft design role in Apollo,\nand now Gemini, it was clear that the Space Task Group needed a\nhome of its own and some growing room. On 19 September 1961,\nAdministrator Webb announced that a new Manned Spacecraft Center\nwould be built on the outskirts of Houston, Texas. It would house the\nenlarged Space Task Group, now upgraded to a center, and would\nhave operational control of all manned missions as well as be the\ndeveloper of manned spacecraft. Water access to the Gulf of Mexico\nwas provided by the ship canal from Houston to Galveston.\nWater access played a role in all site selection for new Apollo\nfacilities. The big Michoud Ordnance Plant outside New Orleans,\nwhere the 10-meter-diameter Saturn V first stage would be fabricated,\nManned Spacecraft Center, 1970. Renamed Johnson Space Center\nin 1973, this has been the lead center for the design and development\nof manned spacecraft and for the operational control of manned space\nflights.\n\n>-~\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n45\n\nMichoud Operations, 1965.\nThe Mississippi Test Facility headquarters building, 1966. It is now\nthe National Space Technology Laboratories.\n\n46\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nwas on the Mississippi River; the Mississippi Test Facility, with its\nhuge test stands for static firing tests of the booster stages, was just off\nthe Gulf of Mexico, in Pearl River County, Mississippi.\nAll this effort would come together at the launch site at Cape\nCanaveral, Florida, where NASA had a small Launch Operations\nCenter, headed by Kurt H. Debus. NASA had been a tenant there,\nusing Air Force launch facilities and tracking range. Now Apollo\nloomed. Apollo would require physical facilities much too large to fit\non the crowded Cape. For safety\'s sake there would have to be large\nbuffer zones of land around the launch pads; if a catastrophic accident\noccurred, where all stages of the huge launch vehicle exploded at once,\nthe force of the detonation would approach that of a small atomic\nbomb. So NASA sought and received congressional approval to purchase 450 square kilometers of Merritt Island, just northwest of the\nAir Force facilities. Lying between the Banana River and the Atlantic\nand populated mostly by orange growers, Merritt Island had the\nrequisite water access and safety factors.\nPlanners struggled through 1961 with a wide range of concepts\nand possibilities for the best launch system for Apollo, hampered by\nhaving only a gross knowledge of how the vehicle would be configured,\nwhat the missions would involve, and how frequent the launches would\nbe. Finally on 21 July 1962 NASA announced its choice: the Advanced\nSaturn (later Saturn V) launch vehicle would be transported to the\nnew Launch Operations Center on Merritt Island stage by stage; the\nstages would be erected and checked out in an enormous Vertical\nAssembly Building; the vehicle would be transported to one of the four\nlaunch pads several miles away by a huge tractor crawler. This system\nwas a major departure from previous practice at the Cape; launch\nvehicles had usually been erected on the launch pad and checked out\nthere. Under the new concept the vehicle would be on the launch pad\na much shorter time, allowing for a higher launch rate and better\nprotection against damage from lightning, hurricanes, and weather\ncontamination in general. As with the other new Apollo facilities, the\nCorps of Engineers would supervise the vast construction project.\nThe simultaneous building of facilities and hardware was going to\ntake a great deal of money and a great many skilled people. The NASA\nbudget, $966.7 million in Fiscal Year 1961, was $1.825 billion in FY\n1962. It hit $3.674 billion the next year and by FY 1964 was $5.1\nbillion. It would remain near that level for three more years. In\npersonnel, NASA grew in those same years from 17471 to 35 860. And\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n47\n\nof course this was small potatoes compared to the mushrooming contractor and university force where 90 percent of NASA\'s money was\nspent. When the Apollo production line peaked in 1967, more than\n400 000 people were working on some aspect of Apollo.\nIndeed, as the large bills began to come in, there was some wincing\nin the political system. President Kennedy wondered briefly if the goal\nwas worth the cost; in 1963 Congress had its first real adversary debate\non Apollo. Administrator Webb had to point out again and again that\nthis was not a one-shot trip to the Moon but the building of a national\nspace capability that would have many uses. He also needled congressmen with the fact that the Soviets were still ahead; in 1963 they were\norbiting two-man spacecraft, flying a 208-kilometer-orbit tandem mission, and orbiting an unmanned prototype of a new spacecraft. Support\nrallied. The Senate rejected an amendment that would have cut the\nFY 1964 space budget by $500 million.

There is no longer any doubt about the strength and skill of\nAmerican science, American industry, American education and the American\nfree enterprise system. In short, our national space effort represents a great\ngain in, and a great resource of, our national strength.\n\nPATH TO APOLLO\nAs 1963 drew to a close, NASA could feel that it was on top of its\njob. The master plan for Apollo was drawn; the organization and the\nkey men were in place. Mercury had ended with L. Gordon Cooper\'s\n22-orbit flight, far beyond the design limits of the spacecraft. For those\nAmericans old enough to have thrilled to Lindbergh\'s historic transatlantic flight 36 years earlier, it was awesome that in only 50 minutes\nmore flight time Cooper had flown 955 000 kilometers to Lindbergh\'s\n5000. Of 13 NASA launches during the year, 11 were successful. In\naddition to improved performance from the established launch vehicles,\nSaturn I had another successful test flight, as did the troublesome Centaur. The Syncom II communications satellite achieved synchronous\norbit and from that lofty perch transmitted voice and teletype communications between North America, South America, and Africa. The Explorer XVIII scientific satellite sailed out in a long elliptical orbit to\nmeasure radiation most of the way to the Moon.\n\nIll\nTortoise Becomes Hare\nAs 1964 dawned, the worst of Gemini\'s troubles were behind. The\nspacecraft for the first flight was already at the Kennedy Space Center\n(Launch Operations Center, renamed in November 1963 by President\nLyndon B. Johnson), being minutely checked out for the flight. Too\nminutely, too time-consumingly. Not until 8 April did Gemini I lift off\nunmanned into an orbit which confirmed the launch vehicle-spacecraft\ncombination in the rigors of launch. The excessive checkout time of\nGemini I generated a new procedure. Beginning with the next spacecraft, a contingent from the launch crew would work at the factory\n(McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis, Missouri) to check out the spacecraft\nthere. When it arrived at the Cape, it would be ready to be mated with\nits Titan II, have the pyrotechnics installed, and be launched. Only in\nthis way could one hope to achieve the three-month launch cycle\nplanned for Gemini.\nThe new system delayed the arrival of the second Gemini spacecraft\nat the Cape. There the curse set in. Once on the pad the spacecraft was\nstruck by lightning, threatened by not one but two hurricanes, and\nforced to undergo check after check. And when launch day finally came\nin December, the engines ignited and then shut down. More rework.\nFinally on 19 January 1965, Gemini II rose from the launch pad on the\ntail of almost colorless flame from Titan II\'s hypergolic fuels, and in a\n19-minute flight confirmed the readiness of a fully equipped Gemini\nspacecraft and the integrity of the heatshield during reentry. Gemini was\nman-rated.\nThe final test flight was to be a manned, three-orbit qualification\nflight. It was conducted on 23 March without incident. Now the diversified flight program could continue. One of the program objectives was\nto orbit men in space for at least the week that it would take an Apollo\nflight to go to the Moon, land, and return. Gemini IV (3-7 June)\n49\n\n50\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nstayed aloft four days; Gemini V (21-29 August) doubled it to eight\ndays and surpassed the Soviet long-duration record; Gemini VII (4-18\nDecember) provided the clincher with 14 days (330 hours 35 minutes).\nOf more lasting importance than the durability of the equipment was\nthe encouraging medical news that no long-term harmful effects were\nfound from extended exposure to weightlessness. There were temporary\neffects, of course: heartbeat slowed down, blood tended to pool in the\nlegs, the bones lost calcium, etc., but these conditions tended to stabilize\nafter a few days in weightlessness and to return to normal after a few\ndays back on Earth. So far there seemed to be no physiological time\nlimit for man living in space.\nA crucial question for Apollo was whether the three rendezvous\nand docking maneuvers planned for every lunar flight were (a) possible and (b) feasible. Gemini III made the tentative beginning by testing the new thruster rockets with short-burst firings that changed the\nheight and shape of orbit and one maneuver that for the first time\nshifted the plane of the flight path of a spacecraft. Gemini IV tried to\nrejoin its discarded second-stage booster but faulty techniques burned\nup too much maneuvering fuel and the pursuit had to be abandoned\xe2\x80\x94a\nvaluable lesson; back to the computers for better techniques! Gemini V\ntested out the techniques and verified the performance of the rendezvous\nradar and rendezvous display in the cockpit.\nThen came what is still referred to by NASA control room people\nwith pride but also with slight shudders as "Gemini 76." The original\nmission plan called for a target Agena stage to be placed in orbit and\nfor Gemini to launch in pursuit of it. But the Agena fell short of orbit\nand splashed into the Atlantic. The Gemini spacecraft suddenly had no\nmission. Round-the-clock debate and recomputation produced a seemingly bizarre solution, which within three days of the Agena failure was\napproved by Administrator Webb and President Johnson: (a) remove\nthe Gemini 6 spacecraft-launch vehicle combination intact from the\nlaunch pad and store it carefully to preserve the integrity of checkout;\n(b) erect Gemini 7 on the launch pad, check it out, and launch it; (c)\nbring Gemini 6 out and launch it to rendezvous with the long-duration\nGemini 7. And it happened. Gemini VII was launched 4 December\n1965; Gemini VI was back on the pad for launch by 12 December. On\nlaunch day the engines ignited, burned for four seconds, shut off automatically when a trouble light lit up. On top of the fueled booster Astronaut Walter M. Schirra, Jr., sat with his hand on the lanyard of the\nejection seat while the control room checked out the condition of the\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n51\n\nfueled booster. But the potential bomb did not explode. On 15 December Gemini VI lifted off to join its sister ship in orbit. On his fourth\norbit Schirra caught up to Gemini VII and maneuvered to within 10\nmeters; in subsequent maneuvers he moved to within 30 centimeters.\nRendezvous was feasible. Was docking?\nOn 16 March 1966, Gemini VIII on its third orbit docked with its\nAgena target. Docking too was feasible, though in this case not for long.\nLess than half an hour after docking for an intended full night in the\ndocked position, the two spacecraft unaccountably began to spin, faster\nand faster. Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong could not stabilize the joined\nspacecraft, so he fired his Gemini thrusters to undock and maneuver\naway from the Agena. Still he could not control his single spacecraft\nwith the thrusters; lives seemed in jeopardy. Finally he fired the reentry\nrockets, which did the job. By then ground control had figured out that\none thruster had stuck in the firing position. Armstrong made an emergency landing off Okinawa. Despite hardware problems, docking had\nbeen established as feasible.\nThis photo looks out Gemini Xl\'s window at the Agena rocket\nwith which the Gemini crew is practicing rendezvous and tethered\nstationkeeping.\n\n52\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nRendezvous was new and difficult, so experimentation continued.\nGemini IX (3-6 June 1966) tried three kinds of rendezvous maneuvers\nwith a special target stage as its passive partner, but docking was not\npossible because the shroud covering the target\'s docking mechanism\nhad not separated. The shroud did not prevent simulation of an Apollo\nlunar orbit rendezvous. Gemini X (18-21 July 1966) did dock with its\nAgena target and used the powerful Agena engine to soar to a height of\n766 kilometers, the highest in space man had ventured. It rendezvoused\nwith the derelict Agena left in orbit by Gemini VIII four months earlier,\nusing only optical methods and thereby demonstrating the feasibility of\nrendezvous with passive satellites for purposes of repairing them. On the\nAmerica\'s first space walk. Astronaut Edward H. White II fired\nshort bursts with his hand-held maneuvering gun to move around in\nthe zero g of space before returning to the Gemini IV spacecraft.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n53\n\nnext flight Gemini XI caught up with its target in its first orbit, demonstrating the possibility of quick rendezvous if necessary for rescue or\nother reasons. Each astronaut practiced docking twice. Using Agena\npropulsion, they rocketed out to 1372 kilometers above the Earth, another record. The final Gemini flight, Gemini XII (11 November 1966)\nrendezvoused with its target Agena on the third orbit and kept station\nwith it.\nWould astronauts be able to perform useful work outside their\nspacecraft when in orbit or on the Moon? This was the question extravehicular activity (EVA) was designed to answer. The answers proved\nto be various and more difficult than had been envisioned.\nGemini IV began EVA when Edward H. White II floated outside\nhis spacecraft for 23 minutes. Protected by his spacesuit and attached\nto Gemini by an eight-meter umbilical cord, White used a hand-held\nmaneuvering unit to move about, took photographs, and in general had\nsuch an exhilarating experience that he had to be ordered back into the\nspacecraft. Because he had no specific work tasks to perform, his EVA\nseemed deceptively easy.\nThat illusion was rudely shattered by the experience of Gemini IX,\nwhen Eugene A. Cernan spent two hours in EVA; he had tasks to perform in several areas on the spacecraft. His major assignment was to go\nbehind the spacecraft into the adapter area, put on the 75-kilogram\nAstronaut Maneuvering Unit\xe2\x80\x94a more powerful individual flight propulsion system the Air Force had built\xe2\x80\x94and try it out. The effort to get\nthe unit harnessed to his back was so intense that excessive perspiration\nwithin his spacesuit overtaxed the system and fogged his visor. The experiment was abandoned and he was ordered back into the spacecraft.\nMuch more pleasant was the experience of Michael Collins on\nGemini X. He tried two kinds of EVA: the first time he stood in the\nopen hatch for 45 minutes and made visual observations and took pictures; the second time he went out on a 10-meter tether, maneuvered\nfor 55 minutes with the hand-held maneuvering unit and even propelled\nhimself over to the station-keeping Agena and removed a micrometeoroid-impact experiment which had been in space for four months.\nBut reality raised its ugly head again during Gemini XI when Richard F. Gordon, Jr., was assigned a full schedule of work tasks along the\nspacecraft but had to terminate after 33 minutes because of fatigue. He\nhad battled himself to exhaustion trying to control his bodily movements\nand fight against the opposite torque that any simple body motion set in\ntrain. It was Isaac Newton\'s Third Law of Motion in pure form.\n\n54\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nNASA had learned its lesson. When Gemini XII went up, many\nadditional body restraints and hand- and footholds had been added.\nAstronauts had trained for the strange floating sensation by doing the\nsame assignments in water tanks on Earth. Results were gratifying; in\na 2-hour 6-minute tethered EVA (aside from two standup EVAs)\nEdwin E. Aldrin, Jr., successfully performed 19 separate work tasks.\nTotal EVA on this flight added up to 5 hours 28 minutes.\nOn the last seven flights, Gemini experimented with the aerodynamic lift of the spacecraft to ensure pinpoint landings on the Earth\'s\nsurface; with the dispersions possible when Apollo came in from 370 000\nkilometers away, tired astronauts would need this. The inertial guidance\nsystem provided inputs to the computer, which solved the guidance\nequations. On flights VI-X the reentry was controlled by the crew. On\nthe last two flights the data were fed into the automatic system. Results\nwere promising. The average navigational accuracy of the seven flights\nwas within 3 kilometers of the aiming point, much better than previous\nflights.\nGemini was primarily a technological learning experience. So it is\nnot surprising that of the 52 experiments in the program, more than\nhalf\xe2\x80\x9427\xe2\x80\x94were technological, exploring the limits of the equipment.\nBut there were also 17 scientific experiments and 8 medical ones. An\nimportant one was the 1400 color photographs taken of Earth from\nvarious altitudes. This provided the investigators the first large corpus of\ncolor photographs from which to learn more about the planet we live on.\nProbably the most valuable management payoff from Gemini was\nthe operational one\xe2\x80\x94how to live and maneuver in space; next was how\nto handle a variety of situations in space by exploiting the versatility and\ndepth of the vast NASA-contractor team that stood by during flights.\nFinally there were valuable fiscal lessons: an advanced technology program had a "best path" between too slow and too fast. Deviation on\neither side, as had occurred in the early days of Gemini, could cost appalling amounts of money. But once on track, even economies were\npossible. Once Gemini flights were on track, for example, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight George E. Mueller (successor to\nHolmes) had won agreement from his principal contractors to cut the\nthree-month period between launches to two months. This was primarily\nto get Gemini out of the way before Apollo launches started, but it paid\noff financially, too; where total program costs for Gemini were estimated\nin FY 1964 to be $1.350 billion, the actual cost closed out at $1.290\nbillion.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n55\n\nThis, then, was Gemini\xe2\x80\x94a versatile, flexible spacecraft system that\nwound up exploring many more nooks and crannies of this new arcane\nart of spaceflight than its originators ever foresaw\xe2\x80\x94which is as it should\nbe. Major lessons were transmitted to Apollo\xe2\x80\x94rendezvous, yes; docking, yes; EVA, yes; manned flights up to two weeks in duration, yes.\nEqually important, there was now a big experience factor for the astronauts and for the people on the ground, in the control room, around the\ntracking network, on backup status in industry. The system had proved\nitself in the pit\xe2\x80\x94it had evolved a total team that had solved real-time\nproblems in space with men\'s lives at stake. This was no mean legacy to\nApollo.\nSome of the technological payoff had come too late. With the increasing sophistication of Gemini and the consequent slippage of both\nfinancial and engineering schedules, much of the day-to-day engineering\ncould not be waited for by the Apollo designers and engineers. They had\nto invent their own wheel. But the state of the art had been advanced\xe2\x80\x94\nthrusters, fuel cells, environmental control systems, space navigation,\nspace suits, etc. In the development stage of Apollo the bank of knowledge from Gemini paid off in hundreds of subtle ways. The bridge had\nbeen built.\nAPOLLO REALIZED\nThroughout the Gemini operational period, Apollo was slogging\nalong toward completed stages and completed spacecraft. Saturn I, the\nbooster almost overtaken by events, finished its ten-flight program in\n1964 and 1965 with six launches featuring a liquid-hydrogen second\nstage. Not only was it proved out; the clustered-engine concept was\ndemonstrated and an early form of Apollo guidance was tested. The last\nfour flights were considered operational; one (SA-7, on 18 September\n1964) tested a boilerplate Apollo spacecraft. The last three carried\nPegasus meteoroid-detection satellites into orbit. The last two Saturn Is\nwere fabricated entirely by industry, marking a transition from the\nArmy-arsenal in-house concept that had previously characterized the\nMarshall Space Flight Center. Ten launches, ten successes.\nMeanwhile the larger brother, the Saturn IB, was being born. Its\nfirst stage was to generate 7100 kilonewtons of thrust, from eight of the\nH-l engines that had powered Atlas and Saturn I, but uprated to 890\nkilonewtons each. The second stage was to feature the new J\xe2\x80\x942\nliquid hydrogen engine, generating 890 kilonewtons of thrust. It was a\ncrucial element of the forthcoming Saturn V vehicle, since in a five-\n\n56\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nengine cluster it would power the second stage and a single J-2 would\npower the third stage.\nSaturn IB was the first launch vehicle to be affected by a new concept\xe2\x80\x94the "all-up" testing. Associate Administrator Mueller, pressed by\nbudgetary constraints and relying on his industry experience in the Air\nForce\'s Minuteman ballistic missile program, pressed NASA to abandon\nits stage-by-stage testing. With intensive ground testing of components,\nhe argued, NASA could with reasonable confidence test the entire stack\nof stages in flight from the beginning, at great savings to budget and\nschedule. Marshall engineers had built their splendid success record by\nbeing conservative; they vigorously opposed the new concept. But eventually Mueller triumphed. On 26 February 1966, the complete Saturn IB\nflew with the Apollo Command and Service Module spacecraft in suborbital flight; the payload was recovered in good condition. On 5 July\nthe IB second stage, the Instrument Unit\xe2\x80\x94which would house the electronic and guidance brains of the Saturn V\xe2\x80\x94and the nose cone were\npropelled into orbit. The total payload was 28 332 kilograms, the heaviest the U.S. had yet orbited. On 26 August a suborbital launch qualified\nthe Apollo Command Module for manned flight; the attached Service\nModule fired its engine four times; and an accelerated reentry trajectory\ntested the Apollo heatshield at the 40 000-kilometer-per-hour velocity\nof a spacecraft returning from lunar distance.\nThe largest brother, Saturn V, was still being pieced together. Developed by three different contractors, the three stages of Saturn V had\nindividual histories and problems. The first stage, although the largest,\nhad a long lead time and was on schedule. The third stage, though enlarged and sophisticated from the version flown on Saturn IB, had a\nprevious history. It was the second stage that was the newest beast\xe2\x80\x94five\nJ-2 engines burning liquid hydrogen. It became the pacing item of the\nSaturn V and would remain so almost until the first launch.\nOf the three spacecraft, the Lunar Module was, early and late, the\nproblem child. For one thing, it was begun late\xe2\x80\x94a whole year late. For\nanother, it differed radically from previous spacecraft. There were two\ndiscrete spacecraft within the Lunar Module\xe2\x80\x94one that would descend\nto the lunar surface from lunar orbit; another that would separate from\nthe descent stage and leap off the lunar surface into lunar orbit and\nrendezvous with the mother Command Module. The engine for each\nstage would have to work perfectly for that one time it fired. Both had\nteething troubles. The descent engine was particularly troublesome, to\nthe point that a second contract was let for a backup engine of different\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n57\n\ndesign. Weight was a never-ending problem with the LM. Each small\nchange in a system, each substitution of one material for another, had\nto be considered as much in terms of kilograms added or saved as any\ngain in system efficiency.\nBy the end of 1966, the Saturn IB and the Block I Apollo Command and Service Module were considered man-rated.\nOn 27 January 1967, AS-204, to be the first manned space flight,\nwas on the launch pad at Cape Kennedy, moving through preflight tests.\nAstronauts Virgil I. Grissom, Edward H. White II, and Roger B. Chaffee were suited up in the Command Module, moving through the countdown toward a simulated launch. At T-minus-10 minutes tragedy struck\nwithout warning. As Maj. Gen. Samuel C. Phillips, Apollo Program Director, described it the next day: "The facts briefly are: at 6:31 p.m.\n(EST) the observers heard a report which originated from one of the\ncrewmen that there was a fire aboard the spacecraft. . . ." Ground crew\nmembers saw a flash fire break through the spacecraft shell and envelop\nthe spacecraft in smoke, Phillips said. Rescue attempts failed. It took a\ntortuous five minutes to get the spacecraft hatch open from the outside.\nLong before that the three astronauts were dead from asphyxiation. It\nwas the first fatal accident in the American space program.\nShock swept across the nation and the world. In the White House,\nPresident Johnson had just presided over the signing of an international\nspace law treaty when Administrator Webb phoned with the crushing\nnews. Webb said the next day: "We\'ve always known that something\nlike this would happen sooner or later . . . who would have thought the\nfirst tragedy would be on the ground?"\nWho, indeed? What had happened? How had it happened? Could\nit happen again? Was someone at fault? If so, who? There were many\nquestions, few answers. The day following the fire, Deputy Administrator Seamans appointed an eight-member review board to investigate\nthe accident. As chairman he chose Floyd L. Thompson, the veteran\nDirector of the Langley Research Center. For months the Board probed\nthe evidence, heard witnesses, studied documentation. On 10 April Webb,\nSeamans, Mueller, and Thompson briefed the House space committee\non the findings: the fire had apparently been started by an electrical\nshort circuit which ignited the oxygen-rich atmosphere and fed on\ncombustible materials in the spacecraft. The precise wire at fault could\nprobably never be determined. Like most accidents it should not have\nhappened. There had been errors in design, faults in testing procedures.\nBut the basic spacecraft design was sound. A thorough review of space-\n\n58\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nThe seared Apollo Command Module in which three astronauts\nlost their lives stands in mute desolation at Cape Kennedy.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n59\n\ncraft design, wiring, combustible materials, test procedures, etc., was\nunder way. Congress was not satisfied. Hearings in both Houses continued, gradually eroding Webb\'s support on Capitol Hill.\nThe Block I spacecraft would not be used for any manned nights.\nThe hatch on the Block II spacecraft would be redesigned for quick\nopening. The hundreds of miles of wiring in the spacecraft were checked\nfor fire-proofing, protection against damage, etc. An intensive materials\nresearch program devised substitute materials for combustible ones.\nIn effect the Block II spacecraft was completely redesigned and rebuilt.\nThe cost: 18 months delay in the manned flight schedule and at least\n$50 million. The gain: a sounder, safer spacecraft.\nWell before men flew in Apollo spacecraft the question had been\nraised as to what, if anything, NASA proposed to do with men in space\nafter Apollo was over. With the long lead times and heavy costs inherent\nin manned space programs, advance planning was essential. President\nJohnson proposed the question to Webb in a letter on 30 January 1964.\nNASA\'s first-look answer surfaced in congressional hearings on the FY\n1965 budget. Funds were requested for study contracts that would\ninvestigate a variety of ideas for doing new things in space with the\nexpensively acquired Apollo hardware. Possibilities: long-duration\nEarth-orbital operations; lunar surface exploration operating out of\nan unmanned Apollo Lunar Module landed on the Moon: longduration lunar orbital missions to survey and map the Moon; Earthorbital operations leading to space stations.\nThrough 1965 and 1966 the studies intensified and options were\nfleshed out. The Woods Hole conference in the summer of 1965 brought\ntogether a broad spectrum of the American science community and\nidentified some 150 scientific experiments that were candidates for such\nmissions. By 1966 there was a sense of urgency in NASA planning; the\nApollo production line was peaking and would begin to decline in a year\nor two. Unless firm requirements for additional boosters, spacecraft, and\nother systems could be delineated and funded soon, the production lines\nwould shut down and the hardwon Apollo skills dispersed. In the\nFY 1967 congressional hearings, NASA presented further details and\nfixed the next fiscal year as the latest that hardware commitments could\nbe deferred if the Apollo production line was to be used.\nNASA went into the FY 1968 budget cycle with a fairly ambitious\nApollo Applications proposal. It asked for an FY 1968 appropriation of\n$626 million as the down payment on six Saturn IBs, six Saturn Vs,\nand eight Apollo spacecraft per year. The Bureau of the Budget\n\n60\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\napproved a budget request of $454 million. This cut the program by\none third. Congress appropriated only $253 million, so by mid-1968\nthe plan was down to only two additional Saturn IBs and one Workshop, with it and its Apollo Telescope Mount being deferred to 1971.\nManned spaceflight, with its overwhelming priority, had had both\ndirect and indirect impact on the NASA space science program. From\n1958 to 1963, scientific satellites had made impressive discoveries: the\nVan Allen radiation belts, the Earth\'s magnetosphere, the existence of\nthe solar wind. Much of the space science effort in the next four years\nwas directed toward finding more detailed data on these extensive\nphenomena. The radiation belts were found to be indeed plural, with\ndefinite if shifting altitudes. The magnetosphere was found to have an\nelongated tail reaching out beyond the Moon and through which the\nMoon periodically passes. The solar wind was shown to vary greatly in\nintensity with solar activity.\nAll of these were momentous discoveries about our nearby space\nenvironment. The first wave of discoveries said one thing to NASA:\nif you put up bigger, more sophisticated, more versatile satellites than\nthose of the first generation, you will find many other unsuspected\nphenomena that might help unravel the mysteries of the history of the\nsolar system, the universe, and the cosmic mystery of how it all works.\nSo a second generation of spacecraft was planned and developed; they\nwere of the so-called observatory class\xe2\x80\x94five to ten times as heavy as\nearly satellites, built around a standard bus instrumented for a specific\nscientific discipline, but designed to support up to 20 discrete experimental instruments that could be varied from one flight to the next\xe2\x80\x94\nsolar observatories, astronomical observatories, geophysicial observatories. As these complex spacecraft were developed and launched in\nthe mid-1960s, the first results were on the whole disappointing. The\npromise was confirmed by fleeting results but their very complexity\ninflicted them with short lifetimes and electrical failures. There were\nsolid expectations that these could be worked out for subsequent\nlaunches. But by the late 1960s the impingement of manned spaceflight\nbudgets on space science budgets reduced or eliminated many of these\npromising starts. Smaller satellites, such as the Pioneer series, survived\nand made valuable observations on the solar effects\xe2\x80\x94measuring the\nsolar wind, solar plasma tongues, and the interplanetary magnetic field.\nLunar programs fared somewhat better but did not come away\nunscathed. The lunar missions were now in support of Apollo, so they\nwere allowed to run their course. Surveyor softlanded six out of its\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n61\n\nseven spacecraft on the Moon from 1966 through 1968. Its television\ncameras gave Earthlings their first limited previews of ghostly lunar\nlandscapes seen from the surface level. Its instruments showed that\nlunar soil was the consistency of Earth\'s wet sand, firm enough to\nsupport lunar landings by the LM. Lunar Orbiter put mapping cameras\nin orbit around the Moon in all of its five missions, photographed over\n90 percent of the lunar surface\xe2\x80\x94including the invisible back side\xe2\x80\x94and\nsurveyed potential Apollo landing sites.\nPlanetary programs suffered heavy cuts. The Mariner series was\ncut back, but its two flights were exciting new glimpses into the history\nof the solar system. Mariner IV flew past Mars on 14 July 1965 and\ngave man his first close-up view of Earth\'s fabled neighbor. At first\nglance the view was disappointing. Mars was battered by meteor\nimpacts almost as much as the Moon. While there were no magnetic\nfields or radiation belts, there was a thin atmosphere. Manner V flew\nSurveyor VII, perched on the lunar surface in the highlands about\n29 kilometers north of the big crater Tycho, took the photographs in\nthis panoramic mosaic of the area around its landing site. In the center\nof the picture the rolling horizon is about 13 kilometers distant; the\n1.5-meter crater in the foreground is about 5 meters away.\n\n62\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\npast Venus on 19 October 1967; this second pass at mysterious Venus\nfound no magnetic field but an ionosphere that deflected the solar wind.\nThe atmosphere was dense and very hot; temperatures were recorded\nas high as 700 K, with 80 percent of the atmosphere being carbon\ndioxide. But the immediate future of more sophisticated planetary\nexploration seemed bleak. The ambitious Voyager program was curtailed in FY 1966, finally dropped in FY 1968; it envisioned large\nplanetary spacecraft launched on Saturn V which would deploy Mars\nentry capsules weighing 2270 to 3180 kilograms.\nThe applications satellites had been a crowning achievement for\nNASA in the early 1960s. The NASA policy of bringing a satellite system along through the research and development stages to flight\ndemonstration of the system and then turning it over to someone else\nto convert into an operational system received its acid test in 1962. With\nthe demonstration of Syncom performance, the commercial potential\nof communications satellites became obvious and immediate. NASA\'s\nLunar Orbiter II appears in this telephoto shot to be inside the\nhuge lunar crater Copernicus. The mountains in the center of the crater\nrise 300 meters above the flat floor, as does the rim. Distance across this\npart of the crater is about 27 kilometers.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n63\n\nR&D role seemed over, but how should the valuable potential be\ntransferred to private ownership without favoritism? The Kennedy\nAdministration\'s answer was the Communications Satellite Corporation,\na unique concept of a government-industry-international combination.\nThe board of directors would be made up of six named by the communications industry, six by public stockholders, and three named by\nthe President. The corporation would be empowered to invite other\nnations to share the investment, the services, and the profits. This\nprecedent-setting proposal stirred strong political emotions, especially\nin the Senate. A 20-day debate ensued\xe2\x80\x94even escalating to filibuster,\nthe time-honored last resort in cases of deeply devisive issues\xe2\x80\x94before\nthe Administration proposal was approved. On 31 August 1962,\nMariner IV, at a slant range of 1250 kilometers, took this photo of\nMare Cimmerium on Mars. With craters pockmarked by newer craters,\nMars looked depressingly like the Moon.\n\n64\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nPresident Kennedy signed the bill into law. ComSatCorp, as it came\nto be called, set up in business. On 6 April 1965, its first satellite, Early\nBird I, was launched into synchronous orbit by NASA on a reimbursable\nbasis. By the end of 1968, there was an Intelsat network of five communications satellites in synchronous orbits, some 20 of an expected 40\nground stations in operation, and 48 member nations participating. The\nSoviets had mounted a competitive system of Molniya satellites with a\nfirst launch in 1965. They too had sought international partnership,\nbut only France outside of the Iron Curtain countries signed up. By\n1968 they had launched 10 Molniya satellites into their standard\nelliptical orbit. On the American side, the question of governmentsponsored research on communications satellites was not completely\nsolved by the creation of ComSatCorp. Congress continued to worry over\nthe thorny question of whether the government should carry on\nadvanced research on communications satellites versus the prospect that\na government-sponsored monopoly would profit from the results.\nWeather satellites were simpler in the sense that the relationship\nwas confined to two government agencies. The highly successful Tiros\nwas seized on by the Weather Bureau as the model for its operational\nsatellite series. NASA had high hopes for its follow-on Nimbus satellite,\nbigger, with more experiments measuring more parameters. The\nWeather Bureau, however, felt that unless NASA could guarantee a\nlong operational lifetime for Nimbus, it was too expensive for routine\nuse. So NASA continued Nimbus as a test bed for advanced sensors\nthat could provide better measurements of the vertical structure of\nthe atmosphere and global collection of weather date.\nNavigational satellites, one of the early bright possibilities of\nspace, continued to be intractable. But there was a new entry\xe2\x80\x94the Earth\nresources satellite. Impressed by the Tiros photographs and even more\nby the Gemini photographs, the Department of Interior suggested an\nEarth resources satellite program in 1966. Early NASA investigation\nenvisioned a small, low-altitude satellite in Sun-synchronous orbit. What\ncould be effectively measured with existing sensors, to what degree,\nwith what frequency, in what priority? These questions involved an\nincreasing number of government agencies. Then there was the complex\nquestion of what trade-off was best between aircraft-borne sensors and\nsatellite-borne ones. It was a new kind of program for NASA, involving\nmany more government agencies and many more political sensitivities\nthan the uncluttered researches in space.\nThe advanced research activities of NASA also became more\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n65\n\nsubtle and difficult to track. An interlocking network of basic research\nand applied research, advanced research was designed to feed new\nideas and options into the planning process. The most visible portion\nwas flight research. The X-15 had culminated the series of Air Force/\nNASA research aircraft with a glittering series of speed and altitude\nrecords and a very solid base of aerodynamic data. The prototype B-70\nhad been turned over to NASA for research in large aircraft flying\nat supersonic speeds.\nWhen the political question arose as to whether the United States\nshould enter the international competition for a supersonic commercial\ntransport aircraft\xe2\x80\x94a sweepstakes already entered by Great Britain and\nFrance with their joint entry, the Concorde, and by the Soviet Union\nwith its TU-144\xe2\x80\x94NASA already had a solid data base to contribute.\nIt also had the laboratories and the contracting base to manage the\nprogram. But wise counsel from Deputy Administrator Dryden led to\nNASA\'s retreat into a supportive R&D role; he argued that with Apollo\nunder way, NASA could not politically sponsor two high-technology,\nenormously expensive programs in the same budget years without one\nof them being sacrificed to the other or killing each other off in\ncompetition for funds. The subsequent history of the supersonic transport program, including its eventual demise, was eloquent testimonial\nto the wisdom of his judgment. His death in December 1965 was\na loss to the nation.\nAnother visible area of advanced research was the study of hydroplaning\xe2\x80\x94the dangerous tendency of aircraft, when landing, to lose\nbraking control on wet or slushy runways. Research done at Langley\nindicated that the wheels tended to float on top of the water surface;\ngrooving the concrete would drain water and provide much greater\ntraction. Quickly and successfully applied to runways, the same technique soon spread to the national highway system, with equally good\nresults.\nOther research efforts paid big dividends within the space program.\nLewis Research Center had become involved in the use of liquid\nhydrogen as a rocket fuel in 1955. Although liquid hydrogen offered\nvery attractive increases in thrust per kilogram as compared to previous\nfuels, hydrogen had a bad reputation left over from dirigible days and\nthe Hindenburg disaster. But by 1957 Lewis was successfully and\nroutinely firing an 89-kilonewton-thrust engine using liquid hydrogen\nas fuel. It was these tests that gave NASA the confidence in 1959 to\ndecide that the upper stages of the lunar rocket should be fueled with\n\n66\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nliquid hydrogen. Without this additional rocket power, it might have\nbeen impossible\xe2\x80\x94or at least much more expensive\xe2\x80\x94to put men\non the Moon.\nThe quiet-engine program for commercial aircraft grew out of\nwidespread public protest against noise levels around city airports.\nAgain Lewis was the lead center; laborious research into all aspects\nof the jet engine\xe2\x80\x94air inlets, turbine blades, exhaust characteristics\xe2\x80\x94\nled to new possibilities that in combination would dramatically lower\nthe level of noise generated by jet aircraft.\nLong-range prospects of manned planetary exploration depended\nheavily on more efficient thrust-per-pound-of-fuel propulsion. To this\nend NASA had continued the long-range program inherited from the\nAir Force to develop a nuclear-propelled upper stage for a rocket.\nEngineering down to a compact package the enormous weight, size,\nand shielding of the kind of reactor used in nuclear electric power plants\nwas a severe challenge. The inevitable intensification of radiation\ndensity and temperatures defeated existing materials that would contain\nand transmit the heat to an engine. Time after time over the years, test\nfirings of promising configurations had to be stopped prematurely when\nradiation corrosion took its toll. Finally in December 1967 the NRX-A6\nreactor ran for one hour at full power, twice the time achieved before.\nImprovements in reactor fuel elements cut radiation control in half.\nThe Snap program of radioisotope thermoelectric generators also\nprogressed. The Snap-27 had been selected to be the long-life power\nsource for the Apollo science experiments to be left on the lunar surface.\nThe flight-test program on lifting body shapes for possible reentry\nconfigurations of future manned spacecraft got under way at Flight\nResearch Center in 1964. The M-2 lifting body designed at Ames\nResearch Center made 100 flights. Results indicated that a man could\nreenter the atmosphere and land safely on a runway in a lightweight\nlifting-body aircraft. Encouraged by the basic data, NASA ordered\ntwo more lifting bodies with different configurations\xe2\x80\x94the M-2/F-2\nand the HL-10. The M-2/F-2 made 15 successful flights in 1966-1967.\nThe HL-10, after modification, made 13 flights in 1968, 3 of them\nrocket powered.\nAlthough the tragic fire of January 1967 delayed plans for manned\nspaceflight in Apollo hardware for something like 18 months, the\nversatility of the system came to the rescue. The burden of checking\nout the major components of the system was quickly shifted to unmanned flights while a quick-opening hatch was designed and tested,\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n67\n\ncombustibles were sought out and replaced, and the wiring design was\ncompletely reworked. After a nine-month delay, flight tests resumed.\nOn 9 November 1967, Apollo 4 became the first unmanned launch of\nthe awesome Saturn V. A 110-meter-high stack of three-stage launch\nvehicle and spacecraft, weighing a total of 2 823 891 kilograms, slowly\nOn 3 February 1966 the AEC-NASA Nuclear Rocket Development\nStation at Jackass Flats, Nev., fired the first complete "breadboard"\nnuclear rocket engine to be tested by the United States. It made two\nsuccessful 15-minute test runs that day at partial power.\n\n68\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nlifted off Launch Complex 39, propelled by a first-stage thrust of 33 800\nkilonewtons. A record 126529 kilograms of payload and upper stage\nwere put into Earth orbit. After coast in Earth orbit, the third stage\nfired to simulate lunar trajectory, lifting the spacecraft combination to\n17 335 kilometers. With the third stage discarded, the Service Module\nfired its engine to raise the apogee to 18 204 kilometers, then burned\nagain to propel the spacecraft toward Earth reentry at the 40 000kilometer-per-hour return speed from the Moon. All systems performed\nwell; the third stage could restart in the vacuum of space; the automated Launch Complex 39 functioned beautifully. The once-controversial concept of "all-up" testing had been vindicated.\nNext came the unmanned flight test of the laggard Lunar Module.\nOn 22 January 1968, a Saturn IB launched a 14 392-kilogram Lunar\nModule into Earth orbit. It separated, tested its ascent and descent\nengines. The Lunar Module passed its first flight test.\nNow to man-rate the huge Saturn V. Apollo 6, on 4 April 1968,\nput the launch vehicle through its paces\xe2\x80\x94the stages, the guidance\nsystem, the electrical systems. Four of five test objectives were met;\nThree lifting body configurations grouped on the dry lake bed at\nFlight Research Center-left to right, the X-24, M-2, and HL-10.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n69\n\nSaturn V was man-rated. The stage was set for the first manned spaceflight in Apollo since the tragic fire. Apollo 7 would test the crew and\nCommand Module for the ten days in space that would later be needed\nto fly to the Moon, land, and return.\nBut beyond Apollo 7, the schedule was in real difficulty. It was the\nsummer of 1968; only a year and a half remained of the decade\nwithin which this nation had committed itself to land men on the Moon.\nSomehow the flight schedule ought to be accelerated. Gemini\'s answer\nhad been to launch missions closer together, but the size and complexity of Apollo hardware severely limited that option. The only\nother possibility was to get more done on each flight. For a time,\nhowever, it seemed that the next flight, Apollo 8, would accomplish\neven less than had been planned. It had been scheduled as the first\nmanned test of the Lunar Module in Earth orbit, but the LM had a\nlengthy test-and-fix roadblock ahead of it and could not be ready before\nthe end of the year, and perhaps not then. So a repeat of Apollo 7 was\nconsidered\xe2\x80\x94another test of the Command Module in Earth orbit without the tardy LM but this time on the giant Saturn V. Eight years\nearlier that would have been considered a big bite; now, was it big\nenough, given Apollo\'s gargantuan task?\nIn Houston, George Low didn\'t think it was. After all, he reasoned, even this test-flight hardware was built to go to the Moon;\nwhy not use it that way? The advantages of early experience at lunar\ndistances would be enormous. On 9 August he broached the idea to\nGilruth, who was enthusiastic. Within days the senior managers of the\nprogram had been polled and had checked for problems that might\ninhibit a circumlunar flight. All problems proved to be fixable, assuming that Apollo 7 went well. The trick then became to build enough\nflexibility into the Apollo 8 mission so that it could go either way\xe2\x80\x94\nEarth-orbital or lunar-orbital.\nApollo 7 was launched on 11 October 1968. A Saturn IB put three\nastronauts into Earth orbit, where they stayed for eleven days, testing\nparticularly the Command Module\xe2\x80\x94environmental system, fuel cells,\ncommunications. All came through with flying colors. On 12 November, NASA announced that Apollo 8 had been reconfigured to focus\non lunar orbit. It was a bold jump.\nOn 21 December a Saturn V lifted the manned Apollo 8 off\nLaunch Complex 39 at the Cape. The familiar phases were repeated\xe2\x80\x94\nEarth orbit, circularizing of the orbit, etc. But then the Saturn third\nstage fired again and added the speed necessary for the spacecraft to\n\n70\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nB 60\n\no c\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2S-s.8\n\'\n10\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n-\n\nIE a)\n* g-e\nw C\n08\n\n-\n\n60\nB\n\n.

On 23 December the three-man crew\nbecame the first human beings to pass out of Earth\'s gravitational\ncontrol and into the control of another body in the solar system. No\nlonger was man shackled to the near environs of Earth. The TV camera\nlooked back at a small, round, rapidly receding ball, warmly laced\nwith a mix of blue oceans, brown continents, and white clouds that\nwas startling against the blackness of space.\nOn Christmas Eve Apollo 8 disappeared behind the Moon and\nout of radio communication with Earth. Not only were the astronauts\nthe first humans to see the mysterious back side of the Moon; while\nthere they had to fire their Service Module engine to reduce their\nspeed enough to be captured into lunar orbit\xe2\x80\x94irrevocably, unless the\nengine would restart later and boost them back toward Earth.\nAnother engine burn regularized their lunar orbit at 113 kilometers\nabove the lunar surface. TV shared the breathtaking bird\'s-eye view\nof the battered lunar landscape with hundreds of millions on Earth.\nOn Christmas Eve the crew read the creation story from Genesis and\nwished their viewers a Merry Christmas. On Christmas Day they fired\ntheir Service Module engine once again, acquired the 1000-meter-persecond additional speed they needed to escape lunar gravity, and\ntriumphantly headed back to Earth. They had at close range verified\nthe lunar landing sites as feasible and proved out the hardware and\ncommunications at lunar distance\xe2\x80\x94except for the all-important last\nlink, the Lunar Module.\nThat last link, the Lunar Module, was still of major concern to\nNASA. Two more flights were expended to confirm its readiness for\nlunar landing. The Apollo 9 flight (3-13 March 1969) was the first\nmanned test of the Lunar Module. The big Saturn V boosted the\nspacecraft combination into Earth orbit. The lunar-flight drill was\ncarefully rehearsed; the Command and Service Modules separated\nfrom the third stage of the Saturn V, turned around and docked with\nthe Lunar Module. The Lunar Module fired up and moved away to\n183 kilometers; then the spacecraft rendezvoused and docked.\nA final test\xe2\x80\x94was anything different at lunar distance? On 18 May\n1969, Apollo 10 took off on a Saturn V to find out. The entire lunar\nlanding combination blasted out to lunar distance. Once in lunar orbit,\nthe crew separated the Lunar Module from the Command Module,\ndescended to within 14 kilometers of the surface, fired the ascent system,\nand docked with the Command Module. Now all systems were "go."\n\n72\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nOn 16 July 1969, Apollo 11 lifted off for the ultimate mission of\nApollo. Saturn V performed beautifully.

On 20 July the LM\nseparated and descended to the lunar surface. At 4:18 p.m. (EST)\nApollo 11 slowly rose off the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center\non 16 July 1969, as the Saturn V thundered aloft on the way to landing\nthe first men on the surface of the Moon.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n73\n\ncame the word from Astronuat Neil A. Armstrong: "Houston\xe2\x80\x94Tranquility Base here\xe2\x80\x94the Eagle has landed." After checkout, Armstrong\nset foot on the lunar surface\xe2\x80\x94"one small step for a man\xe2\x80\x94one giant\nleap for mankind." The eight-year national commitment had been\nfulfilled; man was on the Moon. Armstrong set up the TV camera\nAstronaut Neil A. Armstrong took this photograph of Edwin E.\nAldrin, Jr., deploying the passive seismic experiments at Tranquility\nBase, while the ungainly Lunar Module crouches in the background.\n\n74\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nand watched his fellow astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., join him on\nthe lunar surface, as Michael Collins circled the Moon in the Columbia\nCommand Module overhead. More than one fifth of the Earth\'s population watched ghostly TV pictures of two space-suited men plodding\naround gingerly in a ghostly, unlikely world of grey surface, boulders,\nand rounded hills in the background. The astronauts implanted the\nU.S. flag, deployed the scientific experiments to be left on the Moon,\ncollected their rock samples, and clambered back into the Lunar\nModule. The next day they blasted off in the ascent module and\nrendezvoused with the Command Module.\nThe astronauts returned to an ecstatic reception. For a brief\nmoment, man\'s day-to-day divisions had been suspended; the world\nwatched and took joint pride in man\'s latest achievement in exploration.\nAstronauts and their families made a triumphant world tour which\nrestated mankind\'s pride in this new plateau of man\'s conquest of the\ncosmos.\n\nIV\nExploitation of Apollo\nThe worldwide euphoria over mankind\'s greatest voyage of exploration did not rescue the NASA budget. At its moment of greatest\ntriumph, the space program was being drastically cut back from the\n$5-billion budgets that had characterized the mid-1960s. Part of the\nreduction was expected; the peak of Apollo production-line expenses\nwas past. But the depth of the cut stemmed from emotional changes\nin the political climate, mostly centering on the unpopular Vietnam\nwar\xe2\x80\x94its sapping expenses in lives and money, the debilitating protests\nat home. As Congress read the public pulse, the cosmos could wait;\nthe Soviet threat had for the moment been put to rest; the new political reality lay in domestic problems. The fiscal year 1970 budget was\nreduced to $3.7 billion. Something had to give. The basic Apollo\nmission was continued, but the last three flights had to be deleted.\nSpace science projections were hit hard. The ambitious $2-billion\nVoyager program for planetary exploration dwindled into oblivion;\nit would later resurface as the much more modest Viking. The new\nElectronics Research Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, under construction since 1964, was sacrificed\xe2\x80\x94transferred to the Department\nof Transportation intact, a $40-million facility and 399 of 745 skilled\nemployees.\nBut the bought-and-paid-for projects continued to earn dividends.\nAn Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO 2) was launched\n7 December 1968. It was the heaviest and most complex automated\nspacecraft yet in the space science program. It took the first ultraviolet\nphotographs of the stars. The results were portentous\xe2\x80\x94first hard evidence of the existence of "black holes" in space. Mariner 6 and 7,\nlaunched in early 1969, journeyed to Mars, flew past as close as 3200\nkilometers, took 198 high-quality TV photos of the planet, 2000 ultraviolet spectra, and 400 infrared spectra of the atmosphere and surface.\n75\n\n76\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nOther programs continued with prepaid momentum. The fifth\nand sixth Orbiting Solar Observatories were launched in 1969, as was\nthe sixth Orbiting Geophysical Observatory. The supercritical wing,\nproduct of four years of wind-tunnel research by Richard T. Whitcomb\nat Langley, was committed to fabrication for test in flight at Flight\nResearch Center. These flight tests confirmed the theoretical data; the\ncurrent generation of transport aircraft could fly up to 160 kilometers\nper hour faster, promising significant operating economies.\n1970 saw the launch of Uhuru, which scanned 95 percent of the\ncelestial sphere for sources of X-rays. It discovered three new pulsar\nstars in addition to the one previously identified. In 1971 Mariner 9\nwas launched; on 10 November, the first American spacecraft went\ninto orbit around another planet. The early months in orbit were discouraging; a gigantic dust storm covered most of the Martian surface\nfor two months. But the dust storm gradually cleared; photographs in\n1972 showed startling detail. Mapping 85 percent of the Martian surface, Mariner 9 photographs depicted higher mountains and deeper\nOAO II, the orbiting astronomical observatory, was the largest,\nheaviest, and most complex scientific spacecraft NASA had developed.\nWith its solar panels deployed, as shown here, OAO II was 6.4 meters\nwide, weighed 2000 kilograms, and carried 11 ultraviolet telescopes\ninto space.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n77\n\nvalleys than any on Earth. The rocky Martian moons, Deimos and\nPhobos, were also photographed. OSO 7, launched on 29 September\n1971, was the first satellite to catch on film the beginning of a solar\nflare and the consequent solar streamers of hot gases that extended out\n10.6 million kilometers; it would also discover "polar ice caps" on the\nSun\xe2\x80\x94dark areas several million degrees cooler than the normal surface\ntemperatures. With the confirmation of the black holes\xe2\x80\x94the enigmatic\ncollapsed star remnants so dense in mass and gravity that even light\ncannot escape\xe2\x80\x94and the previous discoveries of quasars and pulsars,\nthese findings added up to the most exciting decade in modern\nastronomy.\nPlanetary exploration opened further vistas of other worlds.\nPioneer 10, launched 2 March 1972, left the vicinity of Earth at the\nhighest velocity ever achieved by a spacecraft (51 200 kilometers per\nhour) and took off on an epic voyage to the huge, misty planet Jupiter.\nGiant of the solar system, swathed with clouds, encircled by a cluster\nAs the great dust storm on Mars cleared, the circling Mariner 9\nphotographed this giant mountain.

Out from the Sun, out from\nEarth, Pioneer 10 ventured for a year and a half\xe2\x80\x94through the unexplored Asteroid Belt and far beyond. After a 992-million-kilometer\njourney, on 3 December 1973 the tiny spacecraft flew past Jupiter.\nIt survived the fierce magnetic field and sent back photographs of the\nhuge planet and several of its moons, measured temperatures and radiation and the magnetic field. Steadily sailing past Jupiter and away\nfrom the Sun, in 1987 Pioneer 10 would cross the orbit of Pluto,\nbecoming the first man-made object to travel out of our solar system\nand into the limitless reaches of interstellar space.\nPioneer 10\'s partner, Pioneer 11, took off on 5 April 1973 to\nfollow the same outward path. On 3 December 1974 it passed Jupiter\nat the perilously close distance of 42 000 kilometers\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to\n129 000 kilometers for Pioneer 10\xe2\x80\x94and returned data. The composite\nOSO 7\'s White Light Coronography showed three coronal streamers\nshooting out from the Sun. The instrument produces an artificial eclipse\n(the black circle in the center) and photographs coronal activity.

In February 1974 it passed\nVenus, gathering information that confirmed the inhospitable character\nof that planet. Then, using Venus\'s gravitational force as propulsion,\nit charged on toward the innermost planet, Mercury. On 29 March\n1974, Mariner 10 flew past Mercury, providing man a 5000-times\ncloser look at this desolate, crater-pocked, Sun-seared planet than had\nbeen possible from Earth. Using the gravitational field of its host planet\nto alter course, Mariner 10 flew out in a large elliptical orbit, circled\nback by Mercury a second time on 21 September 1974, and a third\nVenus was photographed from 720 000 kilometers by Mariner 10.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n81\n\ntime on 16 March 1975. The cumulative evidence pictured a planet\nessentially unchanged since its creation some 4.5 billion years ago,\nexcept for heavy bombardment by meteors, with an iron core similar\nto Earth\'s and a thin atmosphere composed mostly of helium ringed\nby a weak magnetic field.\nFascinating as was the information on our fellow-voyagers in the\nsolar system and as important as the long-range scientific import might\nbe, Congress and many government agencies were much more intrigued\nwith the tangible, immediate-return, Earth-oriented program that began\noperations in 1972. On 23 July ERTS 1 (Earth Resources Technology\nSatellite) was launched into polar orbit around the Earth. From that\norbit it would cover three quarters of the Earth\'s land surface every 18\ndays, at the same time of day (and therefore with the same Sun angle\nfor photography), affording virtually global real-time information on\ndeveloping events such as crop inventory and health, water storage, air\nA large, fresh impact crater on Mercury was photographed by\nMariner 10 from 34 000 kilometers. The crater, 120 kilometers across,\nlooks similar to many on the Moon, but because Mercury has a gravitational field 2.3 times as strong as the Moon\'s, material ejected at\nimpact is not hurled nearly as far on Mercury.\n\n82\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nand water pollution, forest fires and diseases, and recent urban population changes. In addition it depicted the broad-area-\xe2\x80\x94and therefore\nundetectable by ground survey or aircraft reconnaissance\xe2\x80\x94geologic\npatterns and coastal and oceanic movements. ERTS 1 also interrogated\nhundreds of ground sensors monitoring air and water pollution, water\ntemperature and currents, snow depth, etc., and relayed information to\ncentral collection centers in near real-time. The response was instantaneous and widespread; foreign governments, states, local governments,\nuniversities, and a broad range of industrial concerns became quickly\ninvolved in both the exploration of techniques to exploit these new\nwide-area information sources and in real-time use of the data for\npressing governmental and industrial needs. Some 300 national and\ninternational research teams pored over the imagery. Accurate estimates were possible for the first time of the total planting and growth\nstatus of wheat, barley, corn, and rice crops at various times during\nthe growing season; real-time maps versus ones based on data that\nwould have been collected over a period of years; timber cutting\npatterns; accurate prediction of snow run-off for water management;\naccurate, real-time flood damage reports. Mid-term data included indications that the encroachments of the Sahara Desert in Africa could\nbe reversed by controlled grazing on the sparse vegetation in the fringe\nareas; longer range returns suggested promise in monitoring strip mining and subsequent reclamation and in identification of previously\nunknown extensions of Earth faults and fractures important to detection of potential earthquake zones and of associated mineral deposits.\nLike the experimental communications satellites of the early 1960s,\nthe Earth-resources satellites found an immediate clientele of governmental and commercial customers clamoring for a continuing inflow\nof data. The pressure made itself felt in Congress; on 22 January 1975,\nLandsat 2 (formerly ERTS 2) was orbited ahead of schedule to ensure\ncontinuation of the data that ERTS 1 (renamed Landsat 1} had provided for two and a half years, and a third satellite was programmed\nfor launch in 1977. This would give confidence to experimental users\nof the new system that they could securely plan for continued information from the satellite system.\nThe Earth-resources program had another important meaning.\nIt was a visible sign that the nature and objectives of the space program were undergoing a quiet but dramatic shift. Where the Moon\nhad been the big target during the 1960s and large and expensive\nprograms had been the name of the game, it became increasingly\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\nclear to NASA management as the decade ended that the political\nclimate would no longer support that kind of a space program.

In 1970 NASA for the first time launched more\nsatellites for others\xe2\x80\x94ComSatCorp, NOAA, DoD, foreign governments,\netc.\xe2\x80\x94than for itself. Five years before only 2 of 24 launches had been\nfor others. Clearly this trend would continue through the 1970s.\nMeanwhile Apollo was running its impressive course. Apollo 12\n(14-24 November 1969) repeated the Apollo 11 adventure at another\nsite on the Moon, the Ocean of Storms. One attraction of that site was\nthat Surveyor III had been squatting there for two and a half years.\nA pin-point landing put the LM within 183 meters of the Surveyor\nspacecraft. In addition to deploying scientific instruments and collecting\nrock samples from the immediate surroundings, Astronauts Conrad and\nBean cut off pieces from Surveyor III, including the TV camera, for\nreturn to Earth and analysis after 30 months of exposure to the lunar\nenvironment.\nApollo 15 Astronaut David R. Scott was photographed by the\nLunar Rover, which was parked at the edge of the deep lunar trench\nHadley Rille.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n85\n\nApollo 13 was launched 11 April 1970, to continue lunar exploration. But 56 hours into the flight, well on the way to the Moon, there\nwas a dull thump back in the Service Module behind the astronauts.\nAn oxygen tank had ruptured. Pressure dropped alarmingly. What\nwas the total damage? Had other systems been affected? How crippled\nwas the spacecraft combination? The backup analysis system on Earth\nsprang into action. Using the meager data available, crews at contractor\nplants all over the country simulated, calculated, and reported. The\nverdict: Apollo 13 was seriously, perhaps mortally, wounded. There\nwas not air or water or electricity to sustain three men on the shortest\npossible return path to Earth. But, ground crews and astronauts asked\nsimultaneously, what about the Lunar Module, a self-contained spacecraft unaffected by the disaster? The lunar landing was out of the\nquestion anyway; the lifesaving question was how to get three men\naround the Moon and back to Earth before their life-supporting consumables ran out. Could the LM substitute for the Command Module,\nsupplying propulsion and oxygen and water for an austere return trip?\nThe simulations said "yes." Apollo 13 was reprogrammed to loop\naround the Moon and set an emergency course for Earth return. The\ndescent engine for the LM responded nobly; off they went back to\nEarth. It was a near thing\xe2\x80\x94powered down to the point of minimum\nheating and communication, limiting activity to the least possible to\nsave oxygen. Again the flexibility and depth of the system came to the\nrescue; when reentry was safely within the limited capabilities of the\ncrippled Apollo, the "lifeboat" LM was fondly jettisoned along with\nthe wounded Service Module. Apollo 13 reentered safely.\nThe next flight was delayed while the causes and fixes for the\nnear-tragedy on Apollo 13 were sorted out. On 31 January 1971, Apollo\n14 lifted off, the beginning of the scientific exploration of the Moon.\nThe major new system was a transporter\xe2\x80\x94a cart on which to load\nequipment and bring back rock samples. A major target of the Apollo\n14 mission to Fra Mauro was to climb the walls of the Cone Crater;\nthe attempt failed near the top when the walls turned out to be steeper\nthan anticipated.\nApollo 15 introduced the Moon car, the Lunar Rover. With this\nelectric-powered, four-wheel drive vehicle\xe2\x80\x94developed at Marshall at\na cost of $60 million\xe2\x80\x94the astronauts roamed beyond the narrow confines of their landing site and explored the area. Astronauts on this\nflight covered 28 kilometers of lunar surface, visited a number of craters\nin the Hadley-Apennines area, and photographed the ghostly ravine\n\n86\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nHadley Rille. Thanks to the lowered exertion level because of the\nLunar Rover, exploration time was doubled.\nThe remaining Apollo missions now had all the equipment planned\nfor lunar exploration. Apollo 16 landed in the Descartes area of the\nMoon in April 1972, stayed 71 hours, provided photos and measurements of the lunar properties. Apollo 17, launched 7 December 1972,\nended the Apollo program with the most productive scientific mission\nof the lunar exploration program. The site, Taurus-Littrow, had been\nselected on the basis of previous flights. Objectives were to seek out\nboth oldest and youngest rocks to fill in the geologic history of the Moon.\nFor the first time a trained geologist, Harrison H. Schmitt, was on a\ncrew, adding his professional observations. EVA time was over 22 hours\nand the Lunar Rover traveled some 35 kilometers.\nApollo was ended. From beginning to end, it had lasted 11 Vi years,\ncost $23.5 billion, landed 12 men on the Moon, and produced an\nunassessable amount of evidence and knowledge. Technologically it\nhad produced hardware systems several orders of magnitude more\ncapable than their predecessors. In various combinations, the components of this technology could be used for a wider variety of explorations than the nation could possibly afford. The luxury of choice was:\nwhich of a half dozen possible missions?\nScientific answers were going to be returned over several decades.\nA Lunar Receiving Laboratory had been constructed in Houston to\nbe the "archive" of the 382 kilograms of physical lunar samples that\nhad been returned from various parts of the Moon by six lunar-landing\ncrews. An unprecedented network of scientists in this country and 54\nforeign countries were analyzing the samples with an impressive variety\nof instruments and the expertise of many scientific disciplines. Gross\nresults had already established that the Moon was a separate entity from\nEarth, formed at the same time as Earth some 4.5 billion years ago;\nthat it had its own volcanic history; that with no protective atmosphere\nit had been bombarded by eons of meteors from outer space, which had\nplowed up the surface and in larger impacts had triggered secondary\nlava flows from the lunar interior. Refinement of data would go on\nfor decades.\nApollo had proved many other things: the ability of our diversified\nsystem of government, industry, and universities to mobilize behind a\ncommon national purpose and produce on schedule an immense and\ndiverse system directed to a common purpose. It not only argued that\nman could do many things in space, whether extended lunar explora-\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n87\n\ntion from permanent lunar bases or manned excursions to Mars, but\nargued that solutions to many of man\'s major problems on Earth\xe2\x80\x94\npollution, food supply, natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, etc.\xe2\x80\x94could be ameliorated or controlled by the combination of\nspace technology and the large-scale management techniques applied\nto it.\nDRAMA OF SKYLAB\nNext in manned spaceflight came Skylab. Trimmed back to one\norbital workshop and three astronaut flights, Skylab had had a hectic\nfinancial and planning career, the converse of Apollo. The revised plan\ncalled for an S-IVB stage of the Saturn V to be outfitted as a two-story\norbiting laboratory, one floor being living quarters and the other working room. The major objective of Skylab was to determine whether\nmen could physically withstand extended stays in space and continue\nto do useful work. Medical data from the Gemini and Apollo flights\nhad not completely answered the question. Since there would be far\nmore room in the 27-meter-long Orbital Workshop than in any previous spacecraft, William C. Schneider, Skylab program director,\ndevised a more extensive experiment schedule than all previous spaceflights combined. Most ambitious in terms of hardware was the Apollo\nTelescope Mount; five major experiments would cover the entire range\nof solar physics and make it the most powerful astronomical observatory\never put in orbit. The other major areas of experimentation were Earthresources observations and medical experiments involving the threeman crew. There were important subcategories of experiments: the\nelectric furnace, for example, would explore possibilities of using the\nweightless environment to perform industrial processes that were impossible or less effective on 1-g Earth\xe2\x80\x94such as forming perfectly round\nball bearings or growing larger crystals, much in demand in the electronics industry.\nSkylab 1 was launched on 14 May 1973. The giant Saturn V\nlifted off from Kennedy Space Center to place the unmanned 74910kilogram Orbital Workshop in Earth orbit. Within minutes after launch,\ndisquieting news filtered through the telemetry reports from the Saturn\nV. The large, delicate meteoroid shade on the outside of the Workshop\nhad apparently been torn off by the vibrations of launch. In tearing\noff it had caused serious damage to the two wings of solar cells that\nwere to supply most of the electric power to the Workshop; one of\nthem had sheared off, the other was snagged in the folded position.\n\n88\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nOnce the Workshop was in orbit, the news worsened. The loss of the\nbig shade exposed the metal skin of the Workshop to the hot sunshine;\ninternal temperatures soared to 325 K. This heat not only threatened\nits habitation by astronauts but if prolonged might fog sensitive film\nand generate poisonous gases.\nThe launch of the first crew was twice postponed, while the\nfar-flung ground support team worked around the clock for 10 frantic\ndays, trying to improvise fixes that would salvage the $2.6-bilIion\nprogram. With only partial knowledge of the precise degree and nature\nof the damage, engineers had to work out fixes that met the known\nproblems, yet were versatile enough to cope with unknown ones. There\nwere two major efforts: first, to devise a deployable shade that the\nastronauts could spread over the metal surface of the Workshop; the\nother was to devise a versatile tool kit of cutters and snippers to release\nthe undeployed solar wing from whatever prevented it from unfolding.\nOn 25 May 1973, Skylab 2, an Apollo Command and Service\nMission accomplished, the Skylab Orbital Workshop sails serenely\nabove cloud-shrouded Earth in this photo taken by the Skylab 4 crew\nas they leave to return to Earth. The mission-saving emergency shroud\nshows clearly against the dark surface of the vehicle.\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n89\n\nModule combination, was lifted into orbit by a Saturn IB to look at the\nwounded Workshop, try to fix it, and then dock the crew to inhabit\nit for 28 days. Apollo docked with the workshop on the 25th. The crew\nentered it the next day and deployed a makeshift parasol through the\nsolar airlock. The effect was immediate; internal temperature of the\nWorkshop began to drop. On 7 June Astronauts Conrad and Kerwin\nclambered outside the Workshop and after a tense struggle succeeded\nin cutting the metal straps that ensnared the remaining solar wing;\nit slowly deployed and electrical power poured into the storage batteries.\nHuman ingenuity and courage had made the Workshop operational\nagain.\nThe remainder of Skylab 2 and the follow-on Skylab 3 and 4 were\nalmost anticlimactic after the dramatic rescue of the Workshop. With\nonly minor problems, the missions ticked off their complicated schedules\nof experiments. In spite of the initial diversion, Skylab 2 obtained 80\npercent of the solar data planned; 12 of 15 Earth-resources runs were\nThis color-density rendition of a solar eruption was taken by\nSkylab\'s spectroheliograph.

Its\n28-day mission completed, the Skylab 2 crew undocked and returned to\nEarth.\nSkylab 3 was launched on 28 July 1973, completed almost 60 days\nin orbit, and exceeded by one third the solar observations and Earthresources runs planned. All the medical experiments were performed.\nSkylab 4 (launched 16 November 1973) completed an 84-day flight\nwith all experiments performed, as well as the additional observations\nof the surprise cosmic visitor, comet Kohoutek.\nThe vast mass of astronomical and Earth-resources data from the\nSkylab program would take years to analyze. A more immediate result\nwas apparent in the medical data and the industrial experiments.\nWith the corrective exercises available on Skylab, there was no\nphysiological barrier to the length of time man could survive and function in space. Man\'s biological functions did indeed stabilize after\nseveral weeks in zero-g. In the industrial experiments there was strong\nevidence that the melting and solidification process was promisingly\ndifferent in weightlessness; single crystals grew five times as large as\nthose producible on Earth. Some high-cost industrial processes apparently had new potential in space.\n\nV\n\nWhat Next?\nWhile Skylab was being built, other events significant to the future\nof space exploration were taking place. The initiatives bore the imprint\nof Thomas O. Paine, Acting Administrator after Webb\'s resignation in\n1968 and Administrator of NASA from March 1969 until he returned\nto industry in September 1970. One was a broad approach to increased\ncooperation in space exploration. As had so many of our international\nspace initiatives in the postwar period, this effort offered separate\nproposals to the Soviet Union and to Western European countries.\nThe approach to the Soviet Union began in 1968, with suggestions for\nadvanced cooperation, especially in the expensive arena of manned\nspaceflight. One area of Soviet vulnerability might be that of astronaut/\ncosmonaut rescue. By now the Soviet Union had lost four cosmonauts\nin flight, three in one accident, one in another. They had always\nevidenced a singular concern for cosmonaut safety. Perhaps some joint\nprogram could develop a system of international space rescue. The\ndynamics seemed right; by 1969 the evidence was clear that, whether\nthe Soviet Union had in fact been in a Moon-landing race with the\nUnited States, the United States was ahead. Secrecy in space was\nvirtually nonexistent; size of payloads, destinations of missions, performance\xe2\x80\x94all were detectible by tracking systems.\nPaine\'s first offer was for Soviet linkup with the Skylab Orbital\nWorkshop. But the very hardware implied inequity. The Soviets were\nnot interested. Further explorations found lively Soviet interest in a completely new project to develop compatible docking and rescue systems\nfor manned spaceflights. Negotiations proceeded rapidly. Completed by\nGeorge M. Low, Acting Administrator after Paine\'s departure, the\ngrand plan for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) called for a\nmutual docking and crew exchange mission that could develop the\nnecessary equipment for international rescue and establish such criteria\n91\n\n92\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nfor future manned systems from both nations. A Soyuz spacecraft would\nlift off from the Soviet Union and establish itself in orbit. Then an\nApollo spacecraft would be launched to rendezvous and dock with\nthe Soviet craft. Using a specially developed docking unit between\nthe two spacecraft, they would adjust pressurization differences of the\ntwo spacecraft and spend two days docked together, exchanging crews\nand conducting experiments. All of this was agreed to and it rapidly\nbecame a significant test for the validity of the detente agreements\nwhich President Richard M. Nixon had negotiated with the Soviet\nUnion.\nAn unprecedented detailed cooperation between the two superpowers ensued. A scries of joint working groups of Soviet and American\nspecialists met over several years to work out the various hardware\ndetails and operational procedures. At the Nixon-Brezhnev summit\nin 1973, the prospective launch date was narrowed to July 1975. The\nmost concrete example of U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space was in\ntrain and proceeding with good faith on both sides. The mission flew\nas scheduled on 15 July and smoothly fulfilled all objectives.\nASTP (Apollo-Soyuz Test Project) hardware on view at the Paris\nAirshow in May 1973.

Skylab having been\nnarrowed to the point that it would be a limited answer to the future\nof manned spaceflight, President Nixon invoked a President\'s Space\nTask Group to recommend broad outlines for the next ten years of\nspace exploration. Within this group, chaired by the Vice President,\nSpiro T. Agnew, Paine won acceptance for the concept of the Space\nShuttle. In its original conception, the Space Shuttle would be a\nrocket-boosted airplane-like structure that would take off from a regular\nairport runway, fly to orbital speed and altitude, deploy satellites into\norbit, repair or retrieve satellites already in orbit, and, using an\nadditional Space Tug stage, lift manned and unmanned payloads\nthroughout the solar system. The big changes from the earlier Space\nAge would be that the launcher and shuttle would be reusable for up\nto 100 flights, halving the cost per pound in orbit. But subsidiary\nchanges were only slightly less important: satellites could be designed\nfor orbital rigors, not the additional ones of rocket launch. In a\nmanned mission, the Shuttle could handle up to a seven-man crew in\norbit; three of these could be non-pilot scientists who simply went along\nfor the ride to operate their experiments in an unpressurized laboratory\ncarried in the Shuttle cargo bay. Unmanned missions\xe2\x80\x94manned with\na crew only\xe2\x80\x94could deliver 29 500 kilograms of assorted satellites into\norbit and could land on Earth with a returning payload of 14 500\nkilograms.\nThe report of the Space Task Group to the President was submitted on 15 September 1969. It offered three levels of effort: Option I\nwould feature a lunar-orbital station, an Earth-orbital station, and a\nlunar surface base in the 1980s; Option II envisioned a Mars manned\nmission in 1986; Option III included initial development of space\nstation and reusable shuttles but would defer landing on Mars until some\ntime before the end of the century. Eventual peak expenditures on these\noptions were estimated to vary from $ 10 billion down to $5 billion per\nyear. Study and rework went on for more than two years. Paine left\nNASA to return to industry; his successor, James C. Fletcher, took\noffice in April 1971 and immediately reviewed the status of the Space\nShuttle, particularly for its political salability. He became quickly\nconvinced that the Shuttle as then envisioned was too costly to win\napproval. Total costs for its development were estimated at $10.5\nbillion. Fletcher instigated a rigorous restudy and redesign which cut\nthe cost in half, mainly by dropping the plan for unassisted takeoff and\n\n94\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nsubstituting two external, recoverable, reusable solid rockets and an\nexpendable external fuel tank. This proved to be salable; President\nNixon approved the development of the Space Shuttle on 5 January\n1972.\nFirst Paine and then Fletcher had been trying to get a commitment\nfor a major system in the Shuttle from Western European nations. Their\nown joint space program had not been an unqualified success. Western\nEuropean nations had joined to form two international space organizations, ELDO to produce launch vehicles and ESRO to produce spacecraft and collect and interpret results. The technical capability was there,\nbut political liabilities constantly plagued and disrupted\xe2\x80\x94who paid how\nmuch of what, which nations got which contracts, etc.? The boosters\nhad three stages, each developed in a different country. The launch\nrecord was a gloomy history of one kind of stage failure after another.\nAfter years of effort, Western Europe had little to show for its independent space program. A new start was in the air. It was into this\nrestive environment that Paine came to talk about the next generation\nof the U.S. space program and to hold out promise of some discrete\nmajor segment to be developed and produced in Europe\xe2\x80\x94a partnership\nthat would give them a meaningful piece of the action with full pride\nof useful participation. Europe\'s response was warm, though it took a\nwhile to coalesce. Finally the joint decision was made: Western Europe\nwould jointly build the self-contained Spacelab that would fit in the\ncargo bay of the Shuttle spacecraft; a pressurized module would\nprovide a shirtsleeve environment for scientists to operate large-scale\nexperiments; an unpressurized scientific instrument pallet would give\nlarge telescopes and other instruments direct access to the space\nenvironment. The cost\xe2\x80\x94an estimated $370 million. In 1975 Canada\njoined the international effort on the space shuttle, agreeing to foot the\n$30-million research and development bill for the Remote Manipulator\nthat will be used by shuttle astronauts to emplace and retrieve satellites\nin orbit.\nThe Space Shuttle promised a whole new way of spaceflight\xe2\x80\x94\nnonpilots in space, multiple payloads that could be placed where they\nwere wanted or picked up out of orbit; new designs of satellites, free\nfrom the expensive safeguards against the vibrations and shocks of\nlaunch by rocket. Costs of putting a pound of payload in orbit should\ndrop by one half, from $200 to $100. The $5.2-billion program would\nbuy two prototypes for test in 1978 and 1979. Projected flight programs\nfrom 1980 to 1991 identified a total of almost a thousand payloads to\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 1915-1976\n\n95\n\nbe handled by the Shuttle. True space transportation was in the offing.\nIn space science, the big program was Viking. A reduced version\nof the canceled Voyager program, Viking launched two orbiters toward\nMars in August and September 1975; after orbiting Mars and refining\nthe landing data, the orbiters would dispatch the first of two sophisticated landers to the surface of Mars, probably in July 1976. Among a\nnumber of experiments, the landers would search for evidence of life\non that planet.\nRETROSPECT\nWhere has NASA taken us?

It can no more be slammed shut that could the door opened\nby Gutenberg\'s printing press or by gunpowder; by Galileo\'s telescope\nor by the steam engine; by Pasteur\'s discovery of germs or by the\nunleashing of nuclear energy.
