During\nperiods when the light input to the photomultiplier\nis of low intensity, the dc signal to the integrator\nis integrated to provide an increasing stepping voltage\nwhich is applied to the Schmitt trigger circuit. The\noutput from this circuit is fed to the film-drive logic\nr cu il i ,iIucu overman\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

If after a period .of 3 seconds, the integrated\nvoltage is insufficient to trigger the Schmitt circuit,\nan output pulse from the film-drive logic circuit\nactuates relay K I. This action shorts out the integrator\ncapacitor, and initiates a new integration period. At\nthe same time, a voltage pulse is applied through the\nservo amplifier to drive the film through 1/2 inch of\ntravel. This cycle occurs every 3 seconds as long as\nthe integrated output is insufficient to trigger the\nSchmitt circuit.\nAs the light intensity on the photomultiplier increases, the output of the integrator reaches a higher\nvoltage level in a shorter period of time. As a consequence, the Schmitt circuit provides more frequent\noutput pulses through the film-drive logic circuit to\ndrive the film 1/2 inch and to reset the integrator.\nWhen the light intensity is sufficient to trigger the\nSchmitt circuit every 0.2 second or faster, the output\nof the film-drive logic circuit energizes relay K2. When\nthis occurs, the output from the photomultiplier is\nfed through the proportional amplifier to drive the\nfilm at a rate proportional to the light intensity. If\nthe light intensity drops so that the Schmitt circuit is\ntriggered at a rate slower than every 0.2 second, relay\nK2 is deenergized and the film is driven at the pulse\nrate again, with a minimum speed of 1/2 inch every 3\nseconds.\nThe output of the servo amplifier drive system is\napplied to the dc torque motor on the film drive\n\nshaft. A dc tachometer, also connected to this shaft,\nprovides a rate feedback signal to the servo amplifier\ninput when the film is being driven at a proportional\nrate. The tachometer signal is also applied to channel\n2 of the tape recorder as the film-speed indication.\nThe film speed can also be controlled by the\nmanual film-speed control. With the camera control switch SI set to OFF, relay K3 is deenergized.\nThe pushbutton S2 is held down, and a control\npotentiometer is adjusted to vary the control signal to\nthe servo amplifier input.\nNote:\nInquiries concerning this innovation may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nLangley Research Center\nLangley Station\nHampton, Virginia, 23365\nReference: B65-10086\nPatent status: NASA encourages the immediate\ncommercial use of this invention.
