The latter, organizational connectivity systems, can be categorized as intraorganizational and interorganizational systems. Intraorganization systems provide connectivity to function areas within the business, while interorganizational systems support the exchange of business data between independent business units. These system are not confined to a single entity but span organizational boundaries which can be national or international in scope. A series of case studies was undertaken in an effort to better understand the issues and problems associated with providing an increased flow of information within and outside of an organization. Ten issues emerged from this study. In summary, it is necessary for firms to first consider how effective their internal communications systems are before launching projects that tie the organization to external systems.", "title": "The business case for connectivity", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T16:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920003289, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Adams, Dennis"}, "organization": {"name": "Houston Univ.", "location": "TX, United States"}}, "id": "0a460b2fb8394122933db84be29858e0"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920003289, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hirschheim, Rudy"}, "organization": {"name": "Houston Univ.", "location": "TX, United States"}}, "id": "6964c108017540ccb9d5b41e4c2acb04"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920003289, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920003289, "id": "b0aa784e06ef40c692fd81d2a349bf1f", "publicationName": "Research Inst. for Advanced Computer Science, Networking as a Strategic Tool, 1991", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920003289.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920003289/downloads/19920003289.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920003289/downloads/19920003289.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920003289/downloads/19920003289.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
