As a part of this activity, ConSep simulation tool is being developed which is a MATLAB-based front-and-back-end to the commercially available ADAMS(registered Trademark) solver, an industry standard package for solving multi-body dynamic problems. This paper discusses the application of ConSep to the simulation and analysis of staging maneuvers of two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) Bimese reusable launch vehicles, one staging at Mach 3 and the other at Mach 6. The proximity and isolated aerodynamic database were assembled using the data from wind tunnel tests conducted at NASA Langley Research Center. The effects of parametric variations in mass, inertia, flight path angle, altitude from their nominal values at staging were evaluated. Monte Carlo runs were performed for Mach 3 staging to evaluate the sensitivity to uncertainties in aerodynamic coefficients.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Italy", "submissionId": 20050212103, "endDate": "2005-05-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "13th AIAA/CIRA Internatioal Space Planes and Hypersonic Systems Technologies Conference", "location": "Capua", "id": "b12e8a8d82e549588b455d1c7662746c", "startDate": "2005-05-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050212103, "id": "c34ac84f514047b9a6bae1958ad0ebe8", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050212103.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050212103/downloads/20050212103.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050212103/downloads/20050212103.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050212103/downloads/20050212103.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
