Fl&ge\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis report deals with the impact forces in landing gears. Both\nthe landing impact and the taxying impact have been considered, but drag\nforces have been so far excluded. The differential equations are developed and their numerical integration is shown, considering the nonlinear\nproperties of the oleo shock strut. A way is shown how the dimensions\nof the metering pin may be determined from a given load-time diagram.\nA review of German literature on landing-gear impact is also presented.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n.\n\nThe objective of this report is to study the impact forces acting\non the wheels and shock struts of an airplane. For practical reasons\nthe investigation has been limited to the vertical forces and does,not\nconsider the effect of the drag load which acts on the wheels during .\nthe spin-up time. Within the limits drawn by this restriction, an attempt\nhas been made to develop a method for numerical computations which, it\nis hoped, will be useful in practical design work.\nThe oleo-pneumatic shock strut which is now in general use snd\nwhich has attained a high degree.of perfection exhibits-a rather complicated relation between the force, the stroke, and the rate of stroke.\nFor practical work, it is imperative to express this relation in mathematical form and to develop a method for the numerical solution of the\nensuing differential equations.. A detailed discussion of this subject\nwill be found in the section \xe2\x80\x9cIntentional Nonlinearities.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNevertheless it is sometimes useful to consider a highly idealized\ntype of landing gear which has linear differential equations. Although\nsuch a model will never correctly reproduce the details of the real\nlanding impact, it admits of easy mathematical treatment and permits\nstudy of questions of a more general character. This has been done in\nthe section \xe2\x80\x9cLinear Spring-Damper Systems\xe2\x80\x9d and the usefulness of the\nresults obtained there lies in the fact that they do not depend on the\nmore or less incidental details of real landing gears which unavoidably\nenter the computations of the nonlinear theory.\n\n2\n\nNACA TN 2743\n.\n\nThe later sections of the report are devoted to refinements of the\nmethod. Except for the simple mass correctio~., they will not be used\nIn daily routine work, but they may be of particular importance when\nairplanes of unusual design are\xe2\x80\x9dbuilt.\n\xe2\x80\x98-:-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n* __\n\xe2\x80\x94.\n\nThis.work was conducted at StanfordUniversity under the sponsorship\nand with the financial assistance of the National Advisory Committee for\nAeronautics.\nWhile prepari~ this report the author has received valuable\ninformation on curre~t American.practice throw\nMr. J.

The shock strut may be compressed considerably. It opposes\nthis deformation with an elastic force increasing with increasing stroke\nand with a damping force which depends on the rate of stroke and which\n,dissipates mechanical ener~.\nThis shock strut may be represented by a\nspring and a damper arranged in parallel (fig. 1). The tire is for the\npresent purposes a simple spring whose deformation is more or less proportional to the applied force.\nBetween these two deformable elements there is the mass\n\n~\n\nq\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nof\n\nthe wheel, including those parts of the shock strut which participate in\nthe motion of the wheel. On top of the whole landing gear there is the\nairplane mass or, more exactly, that portion ml of the airplane mass\nwhich belongs to the landi~ gear under cons~deration.\nWhen the airplane lands, this system approaches the ground with a\nconsiderable velocity. As long as the spinning up\xe2\x80\x99of the wheels is not\nconsidered, only the vertical component V of this velocity is of\ninterest. The impact begins when the lower end of the landing gear\ntouches the ground. This instant is designated t = 0, and the vibraare studied\xe2\x80\x99\nwhich follow for t > 0\n- tions of the masses -ml \xe2\x80\x98and ~\nwhen the motion of the lower end of\xe2\x80\x99the spring-mass system is suddenQ\nstopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\ndY\n\nNACA TN 2743\n\n5\n\n.\n\nLinear differential equations are obtained when the shock strut is\nreplaced by a simple spring and a viscous damyer (dashpot) and when\nthe tire is assumed to be a linear spring. There might also be a lipear\ndamper coupled with the tire but, compared with the shock-strut damping,\nthe contribution of the tire to damping is so small that it does not\nseem worth while to include it in the equations.\nThe differential equations of the landing-gear tipact will now be\nformulated. Figure 2 shows the mechanical system intwo positions, one\nfor t = O and the other for some later t\xe2\x80\x9ctie.

Then there\nmay occur a time t >0, where F2 = 0. If this hwpem~\nit would\ntermi~te the domain of validity of the formulas. For greater values\nof t, the force F2 would not become negative (i.e., tensile), but\nthe wheel would leave the ground; the airphne Wmld rebomd.\nBecause of the force Wl, the airplane would soon return to the\nground. Meanwhile its horizontal speed or the angle of attack might\nhave decreased and hence W1 @creased. The vertical velocity at the\nsecond impact would be, on the other hand, co~iderably smaller than V.\nThe new impact would therefore be\xe2\x80\x9dless violent, but not necessarily\nuninteresting, because it would find the shock strut in a less favorable\ncondition, with x >() and, perhaps, close to the possible limit.\nWhether rebounding will occux and how Strong the second impact will\nbe can be determined only from detailed numerical computations in each\nparticular case. But one may say quite generally that the probability\nof a zero of F2 .Ss greater the more solutions the homogeneous equations\nhave.

In view of the many arbitrary assumptions which enter the\nanalysis (e.g., the value of V), one may think of neglecting m2 fOr\ndesign purposes, but one should keep an eye on it when evaluating tests.\nThis rule, of course, is derived from the behavior of the undsmped shock\nstrut. How far it is modified by the damping can be seen only from the\nsystematic numerical work which will now be discussed.\n\nDiscussion of Numerical Results\nDimensio?iless\nparameters.- The formulas developed in the precedhg\nsections have been used to compute some typical examples. In order to\ndraw maximum information from this work, it has been done in dimensionless form, and therefore the choice made for the dimensionless quantities\nmust be discussed before the results may be discussed.\nFor the displacements xl\n\n.\n\nand\n\nx2\n\nand the stroke x\n\na reference\n\nlength is needed, and when they sre plotted against time a reference\ntime is needed. Since the deflections start from zero at t = O and\napproach asymptotically definite values, the static deflections, it\nseems reasonable to adopt the static deflection of the mass ml as a\nstandard of length:\n\n*\n\nA simple time standard may be found in the period of the vibrations which\nthe mass ml can make on the springs kl and ~\nin the absence of\ndamping. This period is\ntime standard\n\n2z~;\n\ndrop the factor 2n\n\nand choose as\n\nFor the forces F1 and F2 the load. WI might be used as standard;\nbut, since Wl depends on the horizontal speed of the airplane and on\nthe angle of attack of its wings, it may have rather different values for\ndifferent landing cases of the same airplane. It is therefore better to\nuse mlg as a reference value.\n\n.\n\n22\n\nNACA TN 2743\nb\n\nBesides these variables there is a set of constants which influence\nthe impact. They are the masses ml and ~, the spring constants kl\nand ~, the damping b of the shock strut,~the load W1 (weight minus\nlift), and the vertical velocity V of the airplane. These constants\nmay be combined to the following dimensionless parameters: m2/ml,\nkl\nkl +-~~\nbT/ml~ w~m~g, and vT/8. These parameters must be chosen\n\nk\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\nfor each example.\nInfIuence of ~prung \xe2\x80\x9cilass.-f most interest in a study of the\nO\nlinear spring-damper system is the influence~f the unsprung mass on\nthe impact force: Since this influence is small in the undamped system,\none may hope to find the same result when daai~ingis present. To check\nwhether this is true, a landing gear has been investigated analytically\nfor two extreme values of-the mass parameter,\n\n~/ml\n\n= O\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n\nand\n\nm2/ml = 0.050. Values \xe2\x80\x9dcommon in current practice\xe2\x80\x9dlie approximately\nhalfwsy between, and the choice has been made in order to make the effects\nmore clearly visible.

However, this simplification may not be\nadmissible when the wheel spin-uy must be considered. Figure 3(b) shows\nthe force F2 between the wheel and the ground, and here it appears\nthat in the early stage there is a considerable difference between the\ntwo cases such that F2 and hence the drag load will increase with the\nunsprung mass.\nInfluence of damping.- High damping in the shock strut is desirable\nsince it dissipates the kinetic ener~ of the airplane and thus prevents\nrepeated rebounding. The influence of damping on the landing imyact may\nbe seen in figure 4. Here the force F2 on the wheel and the stroke x\nof the shock strut are plotted against time for the following set of\nparameters:\nm2/m~ = 0.025\nkl\nkl+~\n\n= 0.25\n\nW1/mlg = 0.2\n\nvT/6 = 2.0\nand bT/ml = 0.5 and 1.0. In the initial stage there is not much difference between the two curves {fig. J(a)), since the impact is caught\nby the tire, but then the rise of F2 is much faster for the case of\nhigher demping; the maximum is reached more quickly but it is only\n7 percent higher than that for the case tith half as much dsmping. The\ndevelopment of the stroke (fig. h(b)) is on the whole similar in both\ncases, but the maximun is lower for high damping. The figures show\nthat, apart from its influence on rebounding (which occws much later),\nhigh damping has its pros and cons and that they must be balanced in\neach design.\n\n24\n\nNACA TN 2743\nh\n\nIn\nInfluence of spring co\xe2\x80\x9dnstants.- another example the influence of\nis compared.

This is easily\nunderstood when one considers the maximum displacement xl of the airplane mass. It is 1.655 h the ftrst case and 1.825 in the second,\nwhile the final static deflections will be O and 0.28, respectively.\nIt is therefore essentially the kinetic energy of the airplane mass and\nnot the weight that is responsible for the impact.\n\nq\n\nq\n\nAll the examples given here show the general trend of changes which\na change of one of the parameters will induce. In the details much will\nbe different when real shock struts with their essential nonlinearity\nare considered.\n\nTaxying\nWhen an airplane taxies on the ground, its tires and the shock\nstruts have the same functions as the tires and springs of an automobile.\nWhether they willbe subject to serious dynamic forces depends on the\nsmoothness of the ground. In the investigation of the taxying impact\nit has become customary to assume that the airplane rolls at moderate\nspeed over a bump shaped after a sine curve. On a turf-covered airfield\nsuch a bump may represent a frozen molehill or a similar obstacle, but\non a well-kept concrete runway it is difficult to discover an obstacle\nof this kind from which the length and height of the bump might be\ntaken, and the same is true for the deck of an aircraft carrier.\nIt is preferred therefore to assume as a standard obstacle a step\nin the ground, as it is encountered in the joints between the runway\nslabs or if a wheel should get over the edge of the pavement (fig. 7).\n\nNACA TN 2743\n\n26\n\n.\n\nFor the mathematical formulation of the.problem it is assumed that\nthe airplane is taxying on the left part of the pavement and that the\nlanding gear has the static deflection:\n\nxl = WI\n\n4.\n\nkl + k2\n\xe2\x80\x98lk2\n\nX2 .@\n%2\nSince taxying is done at low speed, W1\nto the total weight\n\nmlg\n\nin these formulas comes close\nto be carried by one shock strut.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x94-\n\nAt t = O the wheel hits the ste~ in the pavement, and for t > 0\nthe term %X2\nin equation (2%), which represents the force in the tire,\nmust be replaced by %(x2 + h).

When ml is set equal to w in an\nequation, this does not mean that the mass really is infinite but only\nthat the inertia is intentionally overrated. Nevertheless, there is a\ncertain weight mlg to which the load (weight minus lift) W1 and tie\nweight\n\n~g\n\nof the wheel may be referred and which will produce a\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n32\n\nNACA TN 2743\nq\n\ncertain static deflection ?3.

They are represented by the broken lines in\n,-.\nfigures 8 and 9,\n\n.\n\nThese curves show the following featuresfi (1) In the domain of\ninterest they are so close to the exact curveE that they can hardly be\ndistinguished. (2) For large values of t they have different\nasymptotes. This is easily explained. When xl = Constant, the springs\nwill find themselves at last more compressed than they were before the\nimpact. The wheel can therefore not rise by the full height h of the\nstep, and the forces F1 = F2 will be higher than W1. However, this\ndeviation between the two solutions is of,no practical importance, not\nso much because of its small magnitude but because ofiits late occurrence.\nIt is of some interest to study the extreme case that ml = m\nand~=O.\nSince the mass m2 is responsible for the difference\nbetween the forces F1 and F2, it is seen from a glance at figure 9\n.\n.\n\n\x11\x14\n\n\x15\n\n\x14\x15\n\nthat this simplification of the problem goes too far to yield results\nof immediate practical value. The formulas therefore will not be\nreproduced, but some yoints computed from them_.have\nbeen entered in the\nforce diagram (fig. 9). This line ofidots which represent both F1\nand F2 shows approximately how the solution will be changed if the\nunsprung mass m2 is substantially decreased: The sudden rise of F2\nis the same, but the following decrease is faster. The force F1 rises\nmore rapidly (in the \xe2\x80\x9climitingcase has the same discontinuous increase\nas F2), and its maximum will be higher the more ~\nis decreased. This\nshows that in taxying it is not advantageous to have the unsprung mass\n.-.\n.\ntoo small.\n\n\x15\n\x15\n\x15\x14\n\n*\n\n.\n\n5C\n\nNACA TN 2743\n\n33\n\nq\n\nINTENTIONAL NONLIMFARITIES\n.\n\nThe kind of shock strut considered in the section \xe2\x80\x9cLinesr SpringDamper Systems\xe2\x80\x9d is the only one which leads to linear differential\nequations. The spring terms in these equations correspond to the action\nof helical or other steel springs, and such springs were used to some\nextent in early shock struts. Modern shock struts use air as an elastic\nmaterial, and air does not show linesr elasticity unless there is time\nenough to dissipate the heat generated by compression. However, the\nnonlinearity introduced by a pneumatic spring is not severe, even in\nthe extreme case of adiabatic compression.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nQuite different is the situation with the dsmping term in equation (lb). Viscous damping is never realized in shock struts, their\ndamping being produced by the acceleration of oil squeezed through\nnarrow orifices or slots. If the cross section of the orifice does not\nvary, one has a veloci@-square damping, and this already presents an\nessential nonlinearity. But more than this, the necessity of making\nthe best use of the structural weight of the landing gear has led to\nthe introduction of a metering pin which changes the width of the\norifice in such a way as to make the impact force increase quickly to\nits peak value and then stay at this value for a considerable time.\nThe nonlinearity which the metering pin introduces into the differential\nequations is intentional and essential, and one has to study the equations of motion with the corresponding dsmping term. This will be done\nin this part of the report and, since there is no additional difficulty\nconnected with it, the nonlinear elastici~ of the air spring will also\nbe included.\n\nDifferential Equation of Oleo Strut\nOleo struts are built in different forms (fig. 10). They all have\nthis in co?mon: A piston moves in a cylinder, and there are two chambers,\nseparated by a diaphragm and connected by an orifice. The lower chamber\nis filled with Oilj\nthe upper one, partly with oil and partly with air.\nWhen the strut is compressed, oil must flow from the lower to the upper\nchamber, and there may or may not be a metering pin which fills part of\nthe orifice and makes the remaining gap depend on the position of the\npiston.\nThe pressure pl\n\ns\n\n.\n\nin the upper chamber depends only on the air\nvolume and hence on the position of the piston. The pressure p2 in\nthe lower chamber is greater by the pressure which is needed to squeeze\noil through the orifice. The difference is proportional to the square\nof the piston velocity and thus produces a damping of the shock-strut\nmotion.\n\n34\n\nNACA TN 2743\n,\n\nThe relation between the force F1\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\ntransmitted through the shock\n\nstrut, the stroke x, and the rate of stroke ~ will now b.eestablished.\nIn addition to the notations explained in figures lo(a) and 10(b), the\nfollowing symbols \xe2\x80\x98forthe different cross-sectional areas are used:\n\nA.\n\ntotal cross section of piston\n\nq\n\n-inner cross section of barrel at oil level\n\nAl\n\n.\n\n%2\n\n_\n\n-innercross section of piston in figure 10(b)\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n.\n.\n,-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nWhen the strut is fully expmded and at rest, there will be a\ncertain pressure p. in both chambers and a force up to the limit\nF. = poA1\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nmay be applied without displacing the piston.\nWhen the piston is displaced, the content of the chambers is\ndecreased by XAl and, since the oil is incompressible, the air ,volume\nmust decrease by this amount:\n.\n\nxl-1~ (20 - z)&\n=\n.\n\nThe collapse of.a shock strut under the landing impact takes less\nthan 1 second, and one might think that this time would be too short to\nallow for much heat transfer. Then the compression of the air would\nfollow the adiabatic law\n\nplzy = pozoy\n\nwith Y = 1.4. There is, however, a very efficient cooling of the air\nthrough the jet of cool oil which is shot vigorously through the orifice\nand scattered on the cylinder walls. It may therefore be justified to\nassume a much lower value for the exponent, say y = 1.1 or even\nisothermal compression with Y = 1. To decide this point, temperature\nmeasurements in the air chamber would be needed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nI n\n\n.\n\n35\n\nNACATN 2743\n.\nq\n\nElimination of z from the last two equations yields the following\nexpression for the pressure in the upper chsziber:\n\nP,=\n\nPO(Z:;;:X)\xe2\x80\x99\n\nWhen the piston is dis~laced, the volume of the lower chamber is\ndecreased and oil must flow through the orifice into the upper chs.mber.\nIn the case of figure 10(a) the rate of the oil flow is Al~; in the\ncase of figure 10(b) it is A2~, and the oil velocity in tie orifice is\n\nor\n\nv_A2~\n-T\n\n.$\n\n.\n\nHere\n\nA3\n\nrepresents essential~ the area of the gap between the\n\nmetering pin and the edge of the orifice, inclusive of an orifice\ncoefficient, if necessary. This gap area depends in a known way on\nthe stroke \xe2\x80\x98x.

To cover this motion, one mq8t at least write pl - P2\ninstead of p2 - pl in equations (24). However, even this will not\n,-really describe the recoil motion, for the following reason: The oil\njet which is shot in the upper chamber during the upstroke is so\nvigorous that air and oil get thoroughly mixed, and this foam is squeezed\nback during the downstroke. It is therefore scarcely possible to calculate the details of the downstroke until exp&rimental information becomes\navailable concerning the degree of mixing &d the density p which should\nbe used in equations (24) for this phase of the motion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n.n\xe2\x80\x9c\n.\n\nIn figure 10(a) the force acting downwar~ on the piston is simply\n\nF1 = A1P2\n\n-\n\n(\n\n= AIP1 + Al P2 - @\nIn figure 10(b) part of the piston prot~des into the upper chaniber\nand is there exposed to the pressure PI.

In this way a separate\nannular space is created between the plunger piston and the wall of\nthe barrel which is usually connected by good-sized holes with the\nupper chamber. The oil flow through these holes may add some damping.\nIt is easily possible to take care of this effect by a correction of\nthe factor of the second term in equation (25).\n\n_ic\n\nEquations for Landing Impact\n\nFor this study it will be assumed that the force in the tire\nfollows a linear law:\n\n\xe2\x80\x982 = %?%\nbut that the force F1\nstroke x\n\n=d\n\nin the shock strut depends nonlinearly on the\n\non the rate of stroke ;:\n\nthe function F1\n\nbeing givenby\n\nequation (25).\n\nThe equations of motion are essentially \xe2\x80\x9dthesame as equations (2)\nexcept that the terms\n\n%\n\n- ~2) + %(.1\n\n-%)=\n\nbi + \xe2\x80\x98lx\n\n38\n\nNACATN 2743\n.\n\nmust be replaced by\n\nF1(~, x).\n\nThe equations are therefore these:\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n.\n\nmlxl +\n\nFl(ij\n\nX)\n\n= W1\n\n(26a)\n\n..\n\nm2x2 - Fl(~j x) + ~X2,=\n\nO\n\n(26b)\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nSince these equations contain three unknown variables, a third equation\nis needed, the relation\n\n(26c)\n\nx.x.x\n\n12-\n\n_\n\nThe initial conditions for these equations will be different from\nthose used with equations (2).

In this case slide-rule\naccuracy will always be sufficient, and this can be obtained by the\ntrapezoid integration without resorting to painfully small steps.\nHowever, the method has the disadvantage that one never knows exactly\nhow large the error is.

Encouraged by this result, the\nstep At has been doubled. me results of the trapezoid integration\nare shown in the table. The polynomial method proved to be extremely\ntedious and was not pursued further when after several hours of computation the first four lines had not yet stabilized. Hcwever, it was found\npractical to start with the small interval and double the step as soon\nas possible. The polynomial method with At = O.01.second was carried\ntot=\n0.08 second, and then the results for t = 0.02, 0.04j 0.06, and\n0.08 second were used to start the polynomial method with the double\ninterval. This computation was carried up to t = 0.20 second and\nyielded results identical with those obtained for the shorter steps.\n\nNuJnericai\nExample\nAs an illustration of the methods just described an example has\nbeen worked out. The data chosen and the metering pin correspond closely\nto those of a recent American airplane.

The low paj% at the left-hand side of\nthe diagram represents the bulbous end of the metering pin.\n\ns\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nThe shock strut is prestressed with the.force\n.\nF. = po~\n\n= 12,350 lb\n\nUntil the impact force has reached this vslue, only the tire is deformed\nand the simple formulas mentioned after equations (26) a~ply. They\nyield to = 0.0088 second, X. = 0.988 inch, and V. = 119.5 inches per\nsecond. These are the initial conditions for the numerical integration\nof equations (25) and (28). This integration was started by the\ntrapezoid method, using equations (29) and (30), and the time step At\nwas so chosetithat at least a few intervals would pass before the first\nbreak in the curve A3 = A3(x) was reached. This-is possible with\nAt = 0.0025 second, and the first lines of this computation are shown\nin tables 3 and k (where t is counted from the beginning of this integration, not from the first contact between tire and runway). When four\nsteps were completed, the polynomial method was started and the results\n. of these steps were improved. The computation was carried on to\nt = 0.0250 second with x = 0.571 inch, xl = 3.907 inches, and\nX2 = 3.336 tithes. This is sufficiently far past the first break in\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\n.-\n\n0\n.\n\nNACA TN 2743\n\nA3(x)\n.\n\n51\n\nthat it was possible to dotile the step. A new integration table\n\nwas started with the results for t = 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, and 0.025 second\nand it was carried on with At = 0.005 second until t = 0.060 second with\nx= 1.939 inches. The next step would have led beyond the second break\nin the curve A3(x) and hence to large values in the difference schemes.\nTherefore, it was necessary to return to the shorter time step\nAt = 0.0025 second. This makes it necessary to interpolate values for\nthe half intervals. To keep up with the accuracy of the integration,\nthis must be done with the help of the same interpolation parabolas from\nwhich equations (31) and (32) are derived. With the notations used the\nfollowing formula holds:\n\nin which the last term is often negligibly small.\nWith the help of this formula a new integration table was started,\nbeginning with t = 0.0450, 0.0475, . . . second. when it c~e to\nt = 0.0775 second, the next and last break in the A3 diagram was\n.\n.\n\nreached and the higher differences rose so high that it becme necessary\nto reduce the step to 0.00125 second. Eight lines beyond the discontinuity the step was increased to At = 0.0025 second and soon thereafter\nto 0.005 second. At t = 0.14 second it was realized that the higher\ndifferences had become so small that the interval could againbe doubled,\nand with At = 0.01 second the computation was carried until\nt = 0.27 second, when * became negative.\nThe example which was chosen here as a test spectien for the\nnumerical integration is one of the most irregular possible. Most of\nthe computation effort was spent on the bulbous end of the metering pin.\nAs soon as the last corner in figure 13 was passed, the work proceeded\nrather quickly to its end. When the pin is shaped more gently, or when\nthere is no pin at all, it will be possible to start, say, with\nAt = 0.005 second and to change after some time to At = 0.01 second,\nwithout the many tedious changes which\xe2\x80\x9dwere necessary in the present case.\nThe results of the computation are shown in figures 14 and 15. There\nis a double time scale in the diagrams, one beginning at the first contact\nand one at the time to when the numerical integration begins.\nFigure 14 shows the stroke x\n\nand the displacement xl\n\nof the\n\nairplane. There is a first, short phase during which only the tire is\n\n52\n\nNACA TN 2743\nb\n\ndeformed and x =\xe2\x80\x9c0. Then the shock strut begins to work but, because\nof the bulbous end of the metering pin, the strut collapses, at first\nrather slowly. Later it catchesup, and the curves x and xl approach . ._\neach other, indicating that the load maximum is passed and that the tire\nexpands.\nFigure 15 shows the load and its breakdown into the damping force\nand the elastic (air) force according to the two terms of equation (25).\nBecause of the bulbous end of the metering pln the damping force builds\nup rapidly, but then the orifice opens up and the increasing air pressure in the shock strut cannot compensate the decline of the damping _\nforce.\n\n-\n\n.-\n\nDimensioning of Metering Pin\nFor reasons OY weight saving it is desirable that the shock-strut\nforce rise quickly to a high value and then remain at this height for a\nsufficient time to bring the mass ml to rest. As a yractical means\nfor this purpose, the metering pin has beenintroduced into the design\nof shock struts. Now, since there is but one metering pin, it will not\nbe possible to obtain ideal results for different impact conditions, but\nit is possible to pick out one landing case of particular importance and\nto shape the metering pin so that in this case a desired load history is\nobtained. The shape of the pin which has been found for this case must,\nof course, be subjected to a critical study in two respects: It must be\nacceptable to the workshop, and it must yield at least tolerable loadtime diagrams under other landing conditions.

In this way the curves marked \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d in figures 16 and 17\nhave been obtained. The corresponding orifice area is shown in figure 13 by-\xe2\x80\x9dtheline.I. To keep the impact fgce at its peak level, the orifice area must be decreased relative to tie original design, and it\ncomes down to zero.when the motion of the airplane is stopped. The\nsteep descent at the end of this curve is, of comse, not acceptable\nfor the design, since it means a complete-plugging of the orifice and\nwould lead to a high load peak in a case of-harder landing; but the\nupper pat of the curve may lead to an improvement of the design.\n\nA\xe2\x80\x94\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\x94.\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nOne might think of another modification.,of\nthe load-time curve,\ncutting away the peak and.keeping F1 as long as feasible on a medium\nlevel, say at F\xe2\x80\x99 = 46,600 pOUlldS. When th~~ is done, the curves\nmarked \xe2\x80\x9cII\xe2\x80\x9d in figures 13, 16, and 17 result. They show that in this\ncase a slightly longer stroke is needed than in the original design,\nbut there is a considerable saving in dynsmic load.\n\nSince the rise of F1 is interrupted in this case, the orifice\n.\xe2\x80\x94\nmust be opened wider, and figure 13 shows that most of the bulbous end\nof the pin must be removed. The transition must, of course, be smoother\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d\nthan that shown in the diagram, and this wo~d lead to a rounding of the\ncorner in the load-time diagram (fig. 17). Except for this nece$sary\nmodification and for the steep end of the A3 curve, the solution seems \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c*\nacceptable, provided that the pin shaped in,.~his\nway proves to be satis-factory in other landing cases.\n.\nBut there is still one essential point that needs discussion.\nFigure 18 shows the velocities *1 and * for all three cases. For\nthe original pin heavier lines have been used and the two modifications\nare marked \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cII.\xe2\x80\x9d The first modification does not show anything\nin particular, but for the second modified pin ~ jumps suddenly from\none value to another and so does ~ = 21 .-;. Now, a sudden change of\nthe velocity ~\n:ill, of\xe2\x80\x99course, meet with the inertia of the unsprung\nmass, and the metering pin II cannot be acc&ted without discussing this\n\xe2\x80\x94.\ninfluence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n.\n\n.-.\n\nstarting from equations (26) and putting F1 = l?\xe2\x80\x99:\n\nml~l = WI ~ F\xe2\x80\x99.=\n\nm&\n\n+ %X2\n\n= F \xe2\x80\x98..\n\n,\n\n-.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n.\n\n55\n\nNACA TN 2743\n\nThe first of these equations is identical with equation (34a), and the\nsecond yields an undamped vibration:\n\n\xe2\x80\x982\n\n=~+Acosu(t-t\xe2\x80\x99)+B\n~\n\nsinu(t-t\xe2\x80\x99)\n\n.=&/m2\nNow, at\n\nt = t\xe2\x80\x99, when this vibration begins,\n\n~\n\n.\n\n&21\n\nand hence\n.\n~=~\xe2\x80\x99+~sinm(t\n\n-t\xe2\x80\x99)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWhen it is assumed in the example that m2/ml = 0.025, the circular\nfrequency of these vibrations is u = 69.5 second\xe2\x80\x981, that is, about\n10 cycles per second.\nThe stroke x\n\nwill show the same undulation as\n\nw\n\nand so will\n\nthe metering pin. Of course, nobody would think of bui;ding a metering\npin of that shape, in particular since the length and location of these\nundulations would depend on the arbitrary choice of the conditions under\nwhich F1 is kept constant. As soon as a streamlined metering pin is\nchosen corresponding to the simplified analysis, the force F1 will\nfluctuate slightly and thus provide the necessary damping for the transient\nvibrations of x2 and x.\nThere is still a better way of handling this last question. Since\nit is not feasible anywsy to make a metering pin with a sudden change of\ncross section, it is better to assume a force diagram on which the corner\nis well-rounded, say by a parabola\nF1 = Cl + c2t + c3t2\nwhich is so chosen that there is no large discontinuity in\n\ndl?~dt.\n\n56\n\nNACA TN 2743\n\nWhen this force-time\xe2\x80\x9drelationis introduced into the equations of\nthe landing gear, they may easily be integrat-ed,\nand the resulting\nexpressions for x and A along with F niay be introduced into equation (35) to find A3 and hence the cross section of the metering pin.\n\n.\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nThe short broken line at the outset of.the horizontal-line msrked\n\xe2\x80\x9cII\xe2\x80\x9d in figure 17 represents such a psrabolic rounding of a corner in\nthe force diagram. The corresponding values of i and A? have been\nindicated by broken lines in figures 18 and\xe2\x80\x9di3. \xe2\x80\x9cOnemay recognize that\nno great change of the metering pin is needed to make the wheel motion\n.\nmuch smoother, and the corner in the force diagram might still be rounded\nmuch more without a substantial loss of deceleration for the airplane.\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n.\n\n.-\n\nADDITIONAL NONLINEARITIES\nTire\n\n-\n\nThe elastic resistance of the tire depends only in small part on\nthe elasticity of the rubber and is essentially due to the compression\nof the enclosed air. During the landing impact this compression is\nnearly adiabatic and therefore the relation between the tfie pressure\nand the deflection x2 is nonlinear. On the other hand, the relation\nbetween the pressure and the force F2\n\nis nonlinear also because the\n\ntire flattens. On the whole, these and some--other\ninfluences seem to \xe2\x80\x9ccompensateto some extent, and load-deflectfi curves from tests may be\nfairly well approximated by a straight line.--This is illustrated by\n\xe2\x80\x9cfigure 19 which shows such a test result.\nFor design purposes it does not seem worth while to replace, under\nthese circumstances, the linear relation (equation (la)) by anything more\ncomplicated. However, for the.evaluation offiests it may be advisable\nto use the lest available information on the behavior of the tire.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94.\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n.\n\n-\n\nThe nonlinearity of the tire becomes sev&re when it comes to\nbottoming.

In general, bottoming should, of\ncourse, be avoided, but when it comes into consideration, then eqwtion (la) can no longer be applied, and it fist be replaced by the general\n.\nrelation\nF2 = Fp (x2)\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n.\n\n.\n\n8C\n\nNACA TN 2743\n\n57\n\n.\n.\n\nwhich represents an empirical function determined from tests. The\nequations of motion are then these:\n\n(36a)\n(36b )\ninstead of equations (26a) and (26b).\nBecause of the prestressing of the oleo strut these equations are\nnot valid until the shock-strut force has reached the prestress value Fo.\nFor this initial phase of the impact the procedure described in the\nparagraph following equation (26c) must be applied. Since it covers\nbut a small part of the whole impact, one may use there the linear\nlaw F2 = k2x2, the spring constant k2 being taken from the initial\ntangent of the load-cleflection curve of the tire:\n\n%=\n\n1-\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\n-IX2*\n\nFor equations (36a) and (36b) then the initial conditions (equations (27)) are the same as those for equations (26). The equations are\nsolved by numerical integration and table 1 may be adopted, changing\nonly the heading of column (9) where F2 is written instead of ~~\nand then using a graph of the function F2(x2)\n\nto fill this column.\n\nInmost cases it will be possible to neglect the mass\n\n~.\n\nThen\n\nequations (36) are rewritten in the form\n..\n\nmlxl = W1 - F2(X2)\n\nF2(%)\n\n(37a)\n\n(37b)\n\nwhich corresponds to equations (28).

For the shock strut, the stroke x is needed. Thus fsr\nit has always been assumed that x is equal to the difference xl - ~.\nHowever, this relation holds only in the simple case, when the upper part\nof the shock strut (usually the barrel) is rigidly connected with the\nairframe and the wheel is atta-cheddirectly to the lower part (piston).\nA correction is already needed when the shotk strut is inclined from\nthe vertical (fig. 20)-. In this case\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nX1-X2\nx=\nCos a\nThe changes which this relation requires in the integration schemes\nare obvious and there is no need to discuss them in detail.\nHowever, there are cases in which the relation between x and\nxl-x\nis nonlinear.

All the\n\xe2\x80\x982\npreceding sections of this report are exclusively concerned with this\nmodel.\nperhaps a small additional mass\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\x94\n--\n\nHowever, the real airplane is a three-dimensional structure, and when\none or more of its wheels hit the grdund, it may receive not only a\nvertical acceleration but also angular accelerations about different\nsxes. These angular accelerations and the rotatory motion resulting\nfrom them will, of coune, influence the landing impact.\nA detailed study of this phenomenon leads into rather lengthy\ncomputations. Their quantitative results will depend on many details\nand may vary widely between different types \xe2\x80\x9cof airplanes. This section\nwill therefore be restricted to some genera~.considerationsconcerning\nthe best method of analysis.\n\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nThere are two principal Troblems, the symmetric case in which both\nwheels of the main landing gesx strike the ground simultaneously and in\nidentical conditions, either earlier or later than the auxiliary gear,\nand the asymmetric case in which the two wheels of the main gear touch\nthe ground one after the other.\n\nb\n\nr\n\nSymmetric Impact ._\nFigure 22 shows the side view\ninterest for the present purposes.\nwhere the mass m is located.

From this time an impact force F1 of increasing magnitude will\nact in each main gear and it will cause both-a deceleration of the\nvertical movement of the center of gravity and a pitching motion about\nthis point.

These formulas show that\nit is perfectly justifiable to study an isolated landing gear, provided\none does not simply use as mass ml one-half of the airplane mass.\nHowever, this procedure is subject to two essential limitations: It\ncan be applied only until the auxiliary gear comes into action and must.\nat least be modified when the rotation of the airplane leads to a substantial change of the angle of incidence of the wing and hence to a\nchange of the load W.\nConsider the second point first. The angular position of the airplane is determined by the angle a between the ground and a reference\nline in the plane of symmetry of the airplane. This reference line is\nso chosen that u = O when all three wheels\xe2\x80\x93of the airplane just touch\nthe ground without pressure. The angle a .wlichis so defined is not\nidentical with the angle of incidence of the wings, but the two differ\n\xe2\x80\x94\nonly by a constant which depends on the design of the airplane.\nSince only small values of a\nasswned that the lift md hence W\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\n.-\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\n~\n\nneed be c\xe2\x80\x9consi.dered, may be\nit\nis a linear function of a, say:\nb\n\nW=wf\n\n+\n\nW\xe2\x80\x99fu\n.\n\nbut since one must use numerical integration methods anyway an arbitrary\nfunction\n\nw =W(a)\nmay be assumed when this appears to be necessary.

Besides the tables\nfor the integration of Yl, *1, and ~, an additional table is now\nneeded to integrate \xe2\x80\x9cd and &. With the results of these integrations\nthe second line may be started.\nOf course, this analysis does not consider the possibility that the\npilot uses the controls to counteract the pitching movement of the airplane. If he does so, a human element comes into play which is not\neasily incorporated in mathematical formulas.

This simplification, commonly\nused in landing-gear analysis, is still more justified by the results\nrepresented in figure 6, which show that the.exact magnitude of the\neffective weight W1 is of secondary importance for the interesting\nportion of the impact.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n.\n\nWhether a simple one-gear analysis is made or the variability ,]f\nWI is taken into account, this computation ends at the moment when the\nauxiliary gear cornesinto action.

There we then again two phases, a\nfirst one while only one wheel is in contact with the ground and a\nsecond one when both wheels are.\nIn the first phase there is only one force Fl, having the\n\n--\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\nb\n\xe2\x80\x94\n.\n\ndistances a and c from the lateral and longitudinal axes, respectively. It produces the following accelerations:\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nVertical at center of gravity:\n\nti=-Fl+W\n\nAngular with respect to lateral axis:\n\n-=\n\nwith respect to longitudinal axis:\n.\n\n!X4X=-FIC\n.\n\n-.\n\n67\n\nNACA TN 2W3\n.\n.\n\nThe resulting acceleration at the upper end of the active landing gear\nis\n\nand when use is made of the preceding equations there is obtained\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cyl\n\n=\n\n\xe2\x80\x981\n.Yl+=f+$\n\n(\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Y\n\nx\n\n)+:\n\nAgain it is useful to introduce the radii of ggcration\nby:\n\n%\xe2\x80\x99=%/\xe2\x80\x9d\nand to write\nq\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\x981=+!+$+5N\nWhen this is compared with the relation\n\n\xe2\x80\x981\n\nW1\n\nq,\n\n~l..\xe2\x80\x94+_\n\nml\n\nused previously, it is seen that one must put\nml\n\nm\n2\nl+++\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n\nC2\n12\nx\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Y\nml\nWl=w=\n\nNACA TN 2743\n\n68\n\n.\nWith these notations the\xe2\x80\x99impact problem is again reduced to a one-gesr\nproblem until the other wheel meets the ground.

During this phase\nof the landing impact the equations of motion (fig. 25) are as follows:\nti\n\n1A\n\n=\n\n-Fl -F3+W\n\n= (-F1 +F3)C\n.\n\n69\n\nNACA TN 2743\n.\n\nBesides there are the kinematic relations\n.\n\nand by combining both sets of equations the following equations are\nobtained which correspond to equations (47):\n\nFl\nyl . -Tl+\n(\n\n$+$)++$\n-$)+:\n\n1\n(48)\n\n\\\n\n%-~)-:~+fi+~)+:\niy\n\nThese equations may be handled exactly in the same way as equations (47),\nwith, however, the restriction that the auxiliary ge& must-still be- \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d\noff the ground. As soon as it makes contact, the relations become more\ninvolved, but it seems at present not necessary to elaborate the details\nof the third phase of the impact which then will follow.\n\nREVIIZWOF GERMAN LITERATURE ON IANDING-GEMR IMPACT\n\nBefore the last war in Germany almost no theoretical work was done\non landing-gear problems, and it seems also that in other countries\ninterest was low.\n\n.\n\nDuring the war in Germany new and unexpected demands could frequently best be met by adapting an existing airplane type, with its\nwell-established mass-production facilities. Such modifications usually\nresulted in an increase of weight without supplying additional space\ninto which a larger wheel could be retracted. Frequent tire troubles\nwere the unavoidable consequence, resulting in a strong impetus to\nlanding-gear research. All but one of the-papers revi~wed-here belong\nto this period of wartime research.\n\n.\n\nWhen studying this German wartime literature, one must keep in\nmind during what period and under what circumstances the work was done.\n\n70\n\nNACA TN 2743\n.\n\nAll of these papers appeared in 1943 and 1944 and were thus the outcome\nof a rather short period of research, They represent an intensive\nattempt to tackle a-long-neglected problem. But before the work had _\nyielded results of-final validity, it was cut off early in 1945 by\nthe national catastrophe. More than 6 years have elapsed and the\nlanding-load problem has undergone changes. ~ome ox the statements\nmade in those papers have lost interest, others are no longer applicable\nwithout modification, and most of the analyt~cal methods are either\noversimplified or too complicated.\n\n. . - :\n. .\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nNevertheless, it is still worth while to survey this literature\nbriefly because it-~ontains\xe2\x80\x9dmany of the ideas and methods which are\nstill the basis of.landing-gear analysis. IiiZie@d, writing this\nfn\nreport the author has drawn much useful information from the German\npublications which.are reviewed on the following pages.\n\n,.\n\xe2\x80\x94\n.\n\nThe goal of the early landing-gear rese~rchwas influenced by the\nattitude of official regulations. They required that a drop test be\nmade in which the upper end of the shock strut was connected with a\nmass ml in the notation of this paper) and the two dropped on an\n(\nanvil. At the instant when the anvil was struck, the weight W1 was\ncompensated by admitting compressed air to two cylinders. The load\xe2\x80\x93\nstroke curve obtained by this test was then considered as \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x9d load- stroke curve of the shock strut and was employed in all landing cases\nwhich had to be considered in the design of the airplane. _Consequently,\nthe effort nf the early research was directed\xe2\x80\x9dtoward the investigation\n.\xe2\x80\x94\nof load-stroke diagrams of shock struts.\n~~\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n.\n\nThe first paper that must be mentioned here, and the only one that\nappeared before the.war, was written by Michael (reference 1). It gives\na detailed analysis of.the linear spring-damper system but pays only\nslight attention to the tire. A special feature of this paper is the\nuse of spring diagrams in which the force is \xe2\x80\x98~lottedeither against the\xe2\x80\x9d\nstroke with the rate of stroke as a parameter or, inversely, against\nthe rate of stroke with the stroke as parameter. These diagrams are\nshown also for shock struts with dry friction or with velocity-square\ndampers, and they are used for a graphical solution of thediffkrential\nequation. Such diagrams are no longer possible when a second spring\n(the tire) is yresent, and therefore they have not been employed again\nin later ~apers.\nThe first papers of the war period were .stillfocused on the loadstroke diagram. Schlaefke (reference 2) criticized the drop-test method\nand suggested replacing the buffered drop test by an unbuffered test,\nthat is, omitting the air cylinders and with them a possible source of\ninaccuracy. His paper usesthe theory of the linear spring-damper system\nto establish some relations between the results of both tests.\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n+\n.\n\nNACA TN 2743\n\n71\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn a later paper (reference 3) the same author realizes that the\ndamping in the oleo strut is far from proportional to the rate of\nstroke. He compares load-stroke curves for linear and for velocitysquare dsmping and arrives at the strange conclusion that the former\nlook more realistic. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99&method used for the analysis of the nonlinear\nproblem is of interest. A balance of kinetic and potential energy is\nestablished and from it, a differential equation between k as dependent\nand x as independent variable. When it is solved, the damping force\n(proportional to k2) is also known in terms of x. However, this\nayproach is not possible in the presence of a tire.\nIn the next group of papers the tire makes its a~pesrance. A\npaper by Kochanowsky (reference 4) gives a very detailed analysis of\nthe oleo-tire combination as shown in figure 1. Kochanows@ finds that\nthe unsprung mass is of no great importance for the landing impact and\nthat the problem may readilybe simplifiedby assuming ~ = O. The\nstudy of this paper (and of many others) is rendered difficult by the\nauthor\xe2\x80\x99s habit of using for all and everything dimensionless quantities\nso that the reader has to learn first a system of not very suggestive\nnotations before he can follow the analysis or read the diagrams.\nAnother paper by Schlaefke (reference ~) covers approximately the\nsame ground.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n-\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAfter having studied the linear oleo-tire system, the next logical\nstep would have been to consider a nonlinear shock strut, but, incidentally, the few papers which did this were older than Kochanows~ts comprehensive paper on the linear system. One of them is by the same author\n(reference 6), and it was not ~hought to be a study of a nonlinear case.\nIt is concerned with a special type of spring which has long been used\nin railroad-car bumpers and was introduced in landing gears. It consists of a pile of ri~s with conical sides (fig. 26). When it is\nsubjected to an axial compression, the hoop stresses in the rings are\nalternatively tensile and compressive. During the elastic deformation,\nthe rings slip on one afiotherand the pile becomes shorter. Because\nof the slip, there is -considerabledry friction, and when the load F\nis decreased, the deformation x is not immediately decreased but\nfollows a law which is described by fi~re 27. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99herea of the tria\nangular loop represents a loss of energy and the ring pile may thus be\nused as a damped spring. Kochanows@\xe2\x80\x99s paper considers a shock-strut\nand tire combination in which the strut has no other elastic or damping\nelement except such a ring-pile spring. During the first upstroke the\nanalysis is extremely simple, since not even damping appears explicitly\nin the eq~tio~j\nbut when the motion is followed beyond the force\nmaximum, it is linear only in sections but nonlinear on the whole. The\npaper is an interesting study, but the ring-pile shock strut is not\nversatile enough to stsmd the competition with the modern oleo strut,\nand the problem is now obsolete.\n\n72\n\nNACA TN 2743\n.\n\nThe other paper %hich considers a nonlinear shock strut is a very\nserious and very detailed study by Marquard and Meyer zur CapelJ.en\n(reference 7). The authors consider velocity-square damping and\npolytropic compression oethe air, formulate differential equations,\nand integrate them numerically. Utiortunately, the authors overestimate\nthe accuracy requirements of the analysis. .-Inheir tables values are\nt\ngiven to six and even seven significant di~~ts, and consequently they\nemploy an exact but very tedious method of-step-by-step integration.\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n.-\n\nIn addition to the detailed treatment o.fthe nonlinear shock strut,\nthe paper is remarkable-for another reason. It not onlyconsiders an\noleo-tire system with a very realistic shock strut,\nbut it also considers\nthe motion of the whole airplane in itsplaneof symmetry. In a second\npaper (reference 8) the same authors extend their investigation to cases\nof unsymmetric landing. But here also the attempt at exactness goes too far when the decrease of horizontal speed dining the short imPact time.\nis taken into consideration. This is pointed out in a paper by Scbmitz\n(reference 9). This author also considers the pitching motion of the\nairplane and includes the ensuing change of:the lift, but he falls back\nto the old idea of \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x9d load-stroke curve fid fails to realize that\nthe cooperation between the elastic reaction of the air and the dam@ng\nforce caused by the orifice depends largely on the conditions of the\nimpact.\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nBesides the landing impact, the taxying of the airplane has always\nmet with interest. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s paper (reference 1) pays attention to it$\nand Kochanowsky\xe2\x80\x99s papers (references 4 and ~) both congider the taxying\nis\nimpact in full d~tiail. In these papers the...statement. made and proved\nthat when the airplane rolls over a sinusoidal ground swell, the mass ml\ntravels ~actically on a level path and tha~ therefore the analysis may\nbe made on the-assumption that ml = m.\nBesides these papers there are two by Schlaefke in which taxying\nis considered. O\xe2\x80\x9cneof them (reference 10) covers the same ground as\n\nI.\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n,.\n*\n\n.-\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\nthe corresponding part of Kochanows@\xe2\x80\x99s paper (reference 4). The second\n(reference 11) is a short noteconcerning the im~ct during the take-off -.\nrun. It seems to.be the only paper devoted..to this subject, and not\n.\xe2\x80\x9c\nmuch information is found in it.\nAdditionally> there are a number of reports on experiments. .Most\nof them were tests made by the airplane manufacturers and served\nessentially the ptipose.of improving new,.qirplane\na\nmodelto the Pint\nwhere it was ready for production. Today, it is difficult, if.not\nimpossible, to draw other than qualitative~@cymation from these reports\nsince the-airplanes; shock struts, and tires used in these tests no\nbe obtained\nlonger exist and details needed-for an anal@is may no longer\nreadily.\n\n,\xe2\x80\x94\n\n-\n\n.\n\n.\n\n10C\n\n.\n\n73\n\nNACATN 2743\n\nHowever, one of the experimental papers must be mentioned in this\nreview, a short report of H?5ke(reference 12) on the experiments he\nHe measured, as\nmade in the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f%r Luftfahrt.\nfunctions of time, the vertical velocity of the airplane immediately\nbefore and during the landing impact and the vertical and lateral forces\non the wheel.
