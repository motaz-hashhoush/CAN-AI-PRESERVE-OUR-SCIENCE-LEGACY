Thus, the\nability to estimate or predict the dem-nd for air cargo in\nvarious markets is an essential first step in planning research\na i development to improve the contributions to be realized from\n,d\ntechnology. This study has reviewed and summarized the various\nforecasting techniques currently in use in the field. The\nliterature in both the air cargo and air passenger fields has\nbeen examined. A general discussion of the fundamentals of the\nvarious forecasting approaches is presented with references to\nspecific studies as appropriate. An evaluation of the effectiveness of c ~ - r c n methods is made and several prospects for\nt\nfuture activities or approaches are suqgested. Appendices contain summary type analyses of about 50 specific publications on\nforecasting, and selected biblioqraphies on air cargo forecasting,\nafr passenger demand forecasting and general demand and modalsplit modeling.\nB.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is no unanimity of opinion about the adequacy of\ncurrent air cargo (or air freiqht) service and capabilities\nOperators and users often have different objectives, purposes,\nand opinions on the nature of the service offered. The type\nof aircraft used is an extremely important factor which touches\non many facets of the service such as costs, delays, loss and\ndamage, and ability to serve a variety of markets.\n\n.\n\nFor example, the use of "belly" space f o r cargo in regularly scheduled passenger aircraft limits the size and weight\nof individual shipments, a ; often makes the handling of these\n.d\nshipments awkward at many airports. On the other hand, the\neconomics of cperating the all-cargo versions of the normal\npassenger aircraft have restricted them to only the highest\ndensity routes at long staye lengths.\nThus it might be suspected that the air cargo industry\nsuffers from the lack of one or more properly designed dedicated- freighter aircraft. Indeed there are many advanced\nconcepts currently under deve1oT)ment which perhaps cclld be\nap?lied to the design of such aircraft. However, in order to\nprofitably initiate such clcsign studies, forecasts from the\nmarket plac5 will have to indicate the need for increased airlift capacity. Also, some indications of the gross design\ncharacteristics such as payload, range, speed, field length\ncapability, etc. will be required.\n\nThe lead time for the development of new aircraft requires\nseveral years. Therefore, the future need f o r capacity and\nvarious operating characteristics must be based upon the forecasts of air-cargo activity during that time frame and beyond.\nThere are several forecasting techniques which are currently\nbeing used and have been used in the recent past. When attemptinq to examine retrospectively the accuracy of the projections\nresulting from these techniques, the performance is not good.\nThus their ability to provide realistic estimates in the future\nmust also be suspect.\nNevertheless, forecasting is essential to decisions on the\ncommitment of resources to new aircraft and soit\'s important to\nachieve the best possible understanding of the powers and limitations of current forecasting techniques. This is an essential\nfirst step to modifying and extending these current techniques\nin order to improve the accuracy of the forecasts necessary for\nsound design decisions.\nThus the present study was undertaken with the basic objectives of reviewing and summarizing the various forecasting techniques currently in use, and to sugqest which techniques might\nbe most suited to predict the future trends for air cargo.\nIn establishing the scope of the study, both near term\n(next five years) and lonq term (199@ - 2000) time periods were\naddressed, but considerations of mail and military freight were\nexcluded. Also because the techniques are usually quite similar,\nforecasting in air passenger markets was also examined.\nC.\n\nApproach\n\nThe obvious initial step in the study was to generate a\nreasonably comprehensive Siblioqraphy for air cargo forecasting,\nand then examine the documents involved, both to gain insight\ninto the techniques and methods used, and to generate additional\nreference sources. It soon became apparent that there are many\nsimilarities between the methods and techniques of forecasting\nair cargo and forecasting air passenger traffic. Thus the work\nwas expanded to include a survey of the latter field. The\nliterature is much more voluminous with regard to passenger\nforecasting, primarily because of the existence of better datz,\nand it was necessary to be quite selective in order to remain\nwithin the resource constraints prescribed fcr t.he study.\n\nIt was also clear from the preliminary literature survey\nthat forecasting the demand for air cargo service was intimately\ninvolved with the nature of t h e service to be offerer? and the\norganizational aspects of providing that service. Thus the\nreview was extended along the following lines\n\nORIGINAL WAGE l&\nOF POOR Q u m\n-2-\n\nthe development and review of a selective bibliography\nof reports and papers relating tr, the entire air\ncargo system;\na review of the more general material contained in\nmonographs and texts, or in conference proceedings,\ne.g., the International Forums for Air Cargo: and\nan examination of the development of the major issues\ni . air cargo from the viewpoint of the trade journals\nr\nin the industry.\nThus, in essence the results, conclusions and recommendations presented later in this report are based on a relatively\nthorough study of selected material relating to the air cargo\nindustry in general, and the forecasting of air cargo demand\nand air passenger traffic.in particular. The many judgements\nrequired have been made within a reasonably extensive familiarity\nwith the general fundamentals of forecasting methods and techniques and with the development and application of models for\ndemand and modal split.\nThe material in the report is presented in the following\nformat: A summary presentation of the present status of air\ncargo forecasting is presented in Section D. The various forecasting techniques are explained briefly z.nd their advantages\nand disadvantages are discussed. Secticn D also contains a\ntabulation of some of the carqo and passenger forecasting work\nwhich is adaptable to this type of presentation. The summary\nis supplemented by Appendix A which contains brief critical\nreviews of a number of F a m r s and reports.\nSection E presents the results and conclusions of the\nevaluation of the current status of air cargo demand forecasting\nand some suggestions for t . future are made in Section F.\nke\nWith the anticipation that they might be of value to some\nof the.readers of this report three additional appendices containing bibliographical material have been included as follows:\nB\nC\nD\n\n-\n\nAir Cargo Forecasting\nAir Passenger Demand Forecasts\nGeneral Demand Models and Modal Split Analysis.\n\nThese are not intended to be complete bibliographies, but\nthey are representative of the t.-ypeof work which has been done.\nD.\n\nReview of Forecastina Methods\n-3-\n\n1.\n\nGeneral Comments on Forecasting\n\nIn this section the current methods and techniques\nused in forecasting will be reviewed and summarized. Forecasting is foretelling of the future and can either be a prediction\nor a projection. Cetron (1) says that prediction is an anticipation of future events without qualification. That is, when\nan event is predicted all if\'s and but\'s are considered. Nevertheless, a projection is made with qualification statements such\nas if this\nthen that or statements of a similar nature that\nsafeguard the forecaster from the complications involved in the\nprophetic nature of a forecast. According to Ayres (2), "most\nof the (forecasting) hazards--the uncertainty and unreliability\nof data, the complexity of "real world" feedback interactions,\nthe temptations of wishful or emotional thinking, the fatal\nattraction of ideology or an idee fixe, the dangers of forcing\nsoft and somewhat pliable "facts" into a preconceived pattern-apply to a l l forms of forecasting."\n\n...\n\nThe presentation is focused on the structure of a variety\nof forecasting techniques that have appeared in the literature\nconcerning forecasting in a variety of areas such as business,\nand economic indicators, stock-market, sales and marketing,\nweather, technology and travel demand, amolig others. These\nareas are typical of the many disciplines where forecasting\ntechniques are being used with varying degrees of success.\nAs will be seen, the various techniques involve a wide\nrange of processes and procedures, but they all have certain\nfundamental factors in common which are important in understanding their ability to be applied successfully.\n\nIn essence they represent extrapolations of some sort\nbased on past experience. These extrapclations may be made\non the basis of personal judgment, graphical or proportional\ntechniques, or mathemGtica1 analysis of varying degrees of\ncomplexity, but in all cases -hey - extrapolations.\nare\nBeing extrapolations, they must depend upon a data base,\nbuilt on already-accomplished experience--past, present or\nboth. These data can be obtained and used in a chronological\nsequence (time series) or by examining a variety of the factors\nwhich seem to exert control over the quantity to be forecast\nduring a realtively brief time period (cross sectional)--or in\nsome cases these techniques can be combined.\nEither the forecasts contain the implicit assumption that\nthe factors that were influential in controlling t r system\nie\nperformace as the data were being obtained will (a: continue to\nbe those that are influential, and exert similar influences in\n-\n\n-4-\n\nthe future, or (b) some method nust be devised for.predicting\nthe changes which will occur - the manner and extent of their\nand\ninfluences.\n2.\n\nClassification of Forecasting Techniques\n\nForecasting techniques may be classified based on two\nschools of thought. According to the first school, a forecasting approach is either teleological (i.e., goal oriented),\ndialectical (i.e., conflict oriented), or phenomenological (i.e.,\nanalogy oriented).\nA teleological approach, also called normative forecasting, is based on goals, purposes, objectives, or needs.\nProgram plans are charted toward the goal, modifications are\nmade as and when necessary, and strategies are planned and\nimplemented as time progresses to achieve the goal. The proponents of this approach assert that the future is to be shaped\naccording to the existing needs and so a forecast has to be\nnormative. A typical technique in this area is the technical\nfeasibility analysis which focuses on costs, benefits, social\nvalues, etc., of choosing various program plans. Once the\nprogram plans are chosen, techniques like PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) and GERT (Graphic Evaluation and\nReview Technique are used in the plan implementation phase.\n\nThe underlying philosophy of the dialectical approach\nis that "both history and the future are a sequence of conflicts,\nand the truth content of a system--or the events in the past and\nfuture--are the results of a highly complicated process".\nSuch a process can be modeled only approximately after an honest\ncorrflict definition and resolution. Well-known techniques like\nthe Delphi technique and scenario methods fall in this category.\nThe phenomenological approach is based on the premise\nthat operational behavior is predictable from ad hoc relationships formed from evidence of natural phenomena. Analogy methods,\nwhere the phenomena are observed in an analogous field, and\nempirical methods, where the phenomena are observed from experience or experimentation in the same field, can be classified\nas belonging to this approach.\nAccorciina to the second schoql of thouqht, forecasting\nin-nature.\napproaches are either subjective or\nObjective methods are further classi\nmethods\nand operational and analytical methods. In this section, forecasting techniques are presented and described according to the\nlatter school of thought, primarily on the basis of intuitive\nappeal when viewed from the perspective of transportation forecasting. As will be seen, subjective and objective approaches\ncan be cornbined.\n\n-5-\n\n3.\n\nForecasting Methods\n\nTable 1 presents a summary of the various methods to\nbe discussed in this section. As indicated earlier, these discussions are concerned with basic structure of the method and\nnot with applications. In Appendix A , almost 50 documents from\nthe literature of transportation forecasting are reviewed briefly. Table 2 contains an outline of some of these in a readyreference format which indicates the methods used. A l s o , in the\ntext which follows references are given whenever possible to\nillustrate how the methods have been applied. In many cases\nthese are in areas outside transportation, but the analogies\nshould be apparent.\nIt should be noted that Ellison and Stafford, in an\nappendix to their book, The Dynamics of the Civil Aviation\nIndustry ( 3 ) offer a presentation somewhat similar to Table 2 .\nMost of their articles are piror to 1970, and include some\nrail forecasting studies for comparison. There is only a\nminimal overlap between the two tables.\na.\n\nSubjective Methods\n\nSubjective forecasting methods consider the value judgments\nof individuals or groups in projecting future events. These\nmethods are the most direct and simplest of all the forecasting\ntechniques. The basic aspect of this approach is that %he final\nconclusions reached 8re the result of the educated "guesses" or\nestimates by one or more individuals familiar with the field.\nThese judgments may be rendered with or without any formal evaluation of economic, social or political forces which might. apply\nto the matter at hand. They may be the work of individuals, or\ngroups of small or m,zdi.umsize. The groups may rieet informally\nor they may use structured techniques. Subjective methods are\ndivided into four major groups, namely (i) genius forecasting,\n(ii) consensus forecasting, (iii) scenario forecasting, and (iv)\ncurve fitting by judgment.\n\n(1) Genius Forecasting\nThe simplest of all forecasting techniques is, as Lenz ( 4 )\ncalls, "genius forecasting." It is an undiluted vision of an\nexpert who is openmided and takes a synoptical view of the area\nin which his/her expertise has direct application.\n(2)\n\nConsensus Methods\n\nThe problem with genius\nopinion of an individual and\nleast averaging out multiple\nthe disadvantage inherent in\n\n-6-\n\nforecasting i s that it is the\nexcludes any review process or at\nopinions.

The idea is that the interaction between\nseveral experts is more likely to insure consideration of\naspects which any single individual might overlook. Furthermore, the chance that a hidden bias of one member will be offset by the counter bias of another member is relatively high.\nThere are three varieties of consensus forecasting, namely (i)\nforecasts from polls, (ii) forecasts from committees in interpersonal interaction, and (iii) forecasts from the group judgements obtained in a structured manner.\na.\nPolls\nForecasting from polls consists of sampling a group of representative persons and drawing conclusions fron the responses.\nHowever, extreme caution is to be exercised in designing "polls"\nas the individual responses might be composed of not only true\nvalues but the so-called "systematic and experimental errors"\nas well, if the polls are poorly designed. Therefore, to avoid\nsystematic errors, it is vital in polling to insure that the\ntarget population is properly represented and the problem of\nnonrcsponse is adequately dealt with. The poll should represent\nthe target population and measures must be taken to collect data\nfrom various strata of the sample size, that is, strata that are\nrepresentative of the nonhomogenity of the entire sample. In a\nmail survey, it is absolutely essential to obtain a high rate of\nreturn (>60%). Otherwise the risk of a bias toward those with\nbeliefs on one or both extremes will be very high.\nExperimental errors arise primarily in the actual process\nof collecting and analyzing data. A principal source of such\nerror is a combination of inadequate understanding of a question\nby the responder and faulty interpretation of the response by the\ninterrogator. To minimize this, all mail surveys should be\npretested with follow-up interviews.\nb,\n\nCommittees\n\nA conmon typn of consensus forecast is that prepared by a\ncommittee of experts in an interpersonal interaction. "Project\nSeabed" of the Navy, and "Project Forecast" of the Air Force are\ntwo successful examples of committee forecasting. In "Project\nForecast," representatives from 30 DOD organizations, 10 nonDOD organizations, 26 universities, 70 industrial corporations,\nand 10 not-for-profit organizations participated in the so-called\n"technology panels" and "capability panels". They met during a\nsix-month period (in 1963) and produced forecasts of U . S . defense\nneeds of the 1970\'s. The committee approach, despite its recognition as a successful forecasting technique, suffers lrom drawbacks which are typical of any interpersonal interactions. For\nexample, the "bandwagon effect," that is, the tendency to joint\nthe majority, is a commonly observed phencmenon in committee\napproaches. Further, there are chances of arriving at a false\n\n-11-\n\nconsensus due to fatigue and psychological factors or because\nof the domineering personalities of one or more of the partipants. Several structured approaches to committee activity\nhave been devised to help overcome these shortcomings.\n(c) Structured Group Interactions\nOne of the most popular of the structured techniques is the\nDelphi method, conceived in 1964 by Olaf Helmer ( 5 ) ( 6 of the Rand\nCorporation. This technique requests independent an anonymous\nopinions on the principal topic and closely related issues by the\nsubmission cf questionnaires to a panel of experts which has been\nselected to participate in the exercise. The returns from the\nquestionnaires are analyzed, and some informational statements\n(not specifically related to the identity of any of the respondents) are prepared and circulated to the group. At the same time\na second questionnaire is distributed seeking additional or\nrevised opinions based upon the individual\'s assessment of the\ninformation presented. Again the responses are anonymous. The\nprocess is repeated until the range of opinions (or forecasts)\nobtained from the respondents tends to stabilize.\n\nbp\n\nThe Delphi method has the disadvantage of requirinq a long\nperiod of time to implement. It also depends upon the judgment\nof the administering team in interpreting the questionnaires\nand formulating the informational feedback. Howwet-, it overcomes one major weakness of a regular committee approach to\nreaching judgmental decisions, v i z . , a bias which might b e intoduced by the persuasiveness o f individual members who may not\nhave valid arcjuments or who are not focused on the key issues\ncomputed from earllcr parts of the prosram. There are a number\nof instances where variations of the Delphi technique were used.\nFor example, the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSJP) used a\nvariation of the DFlphi Technicpie called SEER (Systein for Event\nEvaluation and Review) to produce a foreczst o f the informationprocessing industry. The SEER technique considers a nunber of\nDelphi drawbacks such as excessive consumption of time, possible\nfalse-role playinq, lack o f benchmarks to stop iteration of the\ntechnique, lack of event interrelationships, lack of goal orientation, (7), etc.\nSince this approach has many similarities to the general\narea of product, or service, acceptability, an area which is of\nextreme importance to the air cargo industry, it is appropriate\nto pause briefly to describe it in more detail. SEFP. consisted\nof t M o rounds. In the first round, top-level experts from industry participated in % h e evaluation of a pre-prepared list of\npotential events. This list was developed through n literature\nsearch and a series of interviews of users and producers of information processing equipment. The evaluator is permitted to\ninclude additional events in his area of expertise and then\n\n-1 2 -\n\nevaluate the events based on three primary considerations:\nUser desirability--consider the need to make the results of\na given event available as a usable product. In other words, is\nthe output of the event needed desperately, or desirable, or undesirable?\nProducer feasibility--consider technical, economic, and\ncommercial feasibility of converting the event into a usable\nproduct. IE it highly feasible, or likely, or unlikely but\npossible?\nProbable Timing--project a series of three dates for each\nevent: a date of reasonable chance (probability, p = C.2), a\nmost likely date (p = 0.51, and an almost certain date !p = 0 . 9 ) .\nDuring round 11, a group of cctstanding individuals in the\nfield of informaticn processing was a e\n&d\nto evaluate the round\nI data base to refine and augment the data base, to identify\nevents of importance, and to determine possible interrelationships between events. After receiving the inputs from the panel\nof round I1 experts, a refined list of potential events was\nproduced. This list was used to develop a "menu" of alternative\npotential short-, mid-, and long-range goals: and identify\nsupporting events which might be desirable or even necessary to\nmake these goals achievable.\n(3)\n\nScenario Method\n\n" A scenario is a logical and plausible (but not necessarily\nprobable) set of events, both serial and simultaneous, with careful attention to timing and correlations wherever the latter are\nsalient" (8).Kahn, et al. (9) cite two advantages of the scenario\nmethod:\n\n(i) Scenarios are an effective tool to counteract\n"carry over" thinking, and to force the analyst to look at cases\nother than the straightforward "surprise-free" projections;\n(ii) Scenarios are not amenable to abstracting generalizations overlooking crucial details and dynamics. A notable\nexample of the scenario method is due to Kahn-Wiener (10). The\nauthors, in their The Year 2000 construct a scenario which is\nessentially a sequential plotting of events as they could happen\n(but need not). The sequence of events is a projection of a\n"Standard World" in terms of political and cultural development.\nThey pick three base variables and present projections of high,\nmedium, and low a s alternative scenarios. Kahn-Weiner\'s forecasts are extrapolations of straight-line trends coupled with a\ngreat deal of judgments about alternative scenarios.\n\n-13-\n\n(4)\n\nCurve Fitting by Judgement\n\nThe structure of this method is exemplified by its application to \\&at is kncwn as technological forecasting. The technique is h s e d upon the general observations that the rate of\ninvention diffusion of knowledge, obsolescence, and eventually\nreplacenLr-it a new technology follows a consistent pattern\nby\nwhich ap,ears to be a curve with an S-shaped dependence on time.\nIt is, of course, a sincere attempt to correct for the dependence\nof extnplations on maintaining the status-quo in many of the\npotential controlling factors. Experts are called upon to review\nthe emerging technologies and attempt to establish the basic time\nfrarte for the various events which might affect normal extrapolations\nEither the same group or different groups of experts\ncan then kttempt to develop scenarios which indicate the types\nof Zffects and the extent of each which these new events might\nhave on the system under consideration.\nTechnological forecasting is currently receiving much\nattention and is indeed a promising tool. However, Ayres, in\nhis book on the subject, (11) lists the following difficulties\nas sericns problem-; yet to be overcome:\nlack of imagination (or nerve) on the part of the\nexperts :\nan inherent human tendency to overcompensate;\nfailure to anticipate converging developments and/or\nchanges \'-1, competitive systems:\n\n.\n\nover concentration on specific configurational details\nat the expcnse of adequate consideration of large\nscale effects (macrovariables);\nincorrect calculations; and\nj-ntrinsi.:\n*Ancertaintiesand misinterpretation of\nhistorica: "accidents.\n\nIn the a\\\' 3tion field technological forecasting is often\nused to pre?ict the characteristics of future aircraft performaace char zteristics, size, noise, etc. Such forecasts imply\na relaticqship to demand, although in far too many cases this\nis not \'dentified.\n(5)\n\nAddition71 Comments\n\nThe work C L Roberts (12) and Ellis and Rassam (13) involve\nscenario bi3.i.ling\n\n.-\n\n-14-\n\nOne of the most popular uses of committee judgment is to\napply it at the end of a forecasting methodology to temper and\nadjust the results obtained through extrapolation or more analytical approaches discussed later. These adjustments tend to\ninclude the effects of variables for which accurate data are\nnot available, e.g., frequency of service, aircraft type, forthcoming economic developments in an area, shifting social trends,\nimpending governi.:ent support or restrictions.\nThis latter procedure is used with reasonable success by\nthe Air Transport Association (ATA) (141 Various forecasts made\nby iadividual companies throughout all: sectors of the industry\nare collected and analyzed by a special committee. Ensuing discussions among the committee members attempt to achieve an understanding of why various forecasts of similar activities differ\nand then reach a consensus as to the choices and adjustments\nwhich should be made to establish the official ATA position.\nProfessional judgment 1s also rendered on the basis of\nexperience with certain economic indicators. These can either\nbe individual indicators such as those used for econometric\nmodeling or various measures of the individual indicators.\nFor example, the term diffusion index is given to the process\nof monitoring the percentage of a group of indicators which\nare either going up or down. Another popular approach is the\nuse of "leading" indicators, i.e., a time series of an economic\nactivity whose movement in a given direction precedes the movement of some other time series in the same direction.\nFinally, in reading the literature, one cannot escape the\nfeeling that most authors who have worked in the field of transportation forecasting for some time temper, modify, or in some\nway massage the results of their special techniques, whatever they\nmay be, with their own experience. This would seem to qualify\nas application of "genius" forecasting.\n(b) Empirical Objective Methods\nThe objective methods are quantitative in nature and\nrange from very simple-minded approaches to very complex methods\ninvolvi\'ng a great deal of mathematical and statistical sophistication. These methods are broadly divided into two categories,\nviz., (i) empirical methods, and (ii) operational and analytical\nmethods. Empirical methods are derived from experience and experimqntation. Quantitative analyses developed in statistics,\neconometrics, and related fields are, far the most part, empirical in nature.

A n average link\nrelative is then obtained for each quarter-to-quarter comparison.\nThese four numbers, when adjusted to the total 4 0 0 , constitute\nthe seasonal indices.\n(e) General Commens on Trend Models\nTrend models or extrapolations are often used as checks\non other methods. Any forecast which shows a large deviation\nfrom a trend extrapolation should be examhed to justify the\ncauses for such a deviation.\nThe reverse is alss a common occurrence, i.e., the\nreasonableness of the trend extrapolations in the dependent\nvariable representing s m e measure of air traffic activity is\nchecked by comparing these predictions with the independent\nprojections of various economic indicators (17), (18).\nThere are several problems with trend analysis.\nThe method does not provide any useful information\nas to why growth (or its oppcsite) is taking place,\nor what might be done to influence the trends.\nIt implicitly assumes that the socio-economic factors\nwhich control the initial relationship will remain in\nforce to a similar extent during the forecast period.\nThis, of course, emphasizes the importance of having\nsome understanding of these controlling factors at the\ntime that the initial relationship is developed.\nIt does not allow for market generation or results due\nto changes in product or service. Nutter discusses\nthis problem very succintly in terms of transportation\ndemand as follows. (19)\nSuppose one has determined a demand function for a given\nmode\' kl\' operating between i and j at some timet. If this\nfunction is then used to project into the future, the demand is\nestimated at a future time,t\' i.e., we havea projected value\n\nO R * G ~ A LPAGE Is\nDijklt\'.\nNow, if a new mode, k is introducsd and we use the above pmR QUAf,ITy\n,\nOF relation to estimate th6 portion of the demand that could be\ncaptured by the new mode at the same time t\', we are in effect\nsplitting Dijklt, into two parts. The danger involved is that\nthe service provided by mode k ray be very poor related to\nthat to be offerrd by k2 Xevehtheless, the demand for k2 can\nnever be greater than for k by the abov? formulation. Thus\nthere is no opportunity to allow for market generation by a new\nand appealing (to potential users) mode when the above strategy\n-19-\n\nis used for forecasting demand.\n"half of nothing" problem.\n\nNutter refers to this as the\n\n( 2 ) .",Correlation\nAnalysis\n\n.\n\nb\n\n.\n\nJ\n\n_\n\n\'\n\nCorrelation analysis covers problems d5aling with\nrelationships between two or more variables. Two widely used\ncorrelation techniques in the field of forecasting are (i) curve\nfitting with regression, and (ii) trend correlation analysis.\n(a). Curve Fitting with Regression\nIn this approach a dependent variable is characterized as a function of one or more independent variables and\na random disturbance term, E:\nY = f(X)\n\nf (XI\nor t\n\nUSC\n\n+\n\nE.\n\nn\nlly takes the form a + 1 aiXi.\nO i\nbi\nf(X) = A ll Xi\nJ\n.\n\nwhich becomes linear in its logrithmic form. If n = 1, the\nregression is a simple linear regression. If n> 1, the regression is called multiple linear regression. If f ( X ) takes\nthe form of a second or higher degree polinomial or a geometric\ngrowth function, the regression is called nonlinear regression.\nA widely-used technique to estimate the parameters of a regression equation is the method of least-squares, it is a "best fit"\n* 2\n\nin then sense that the sum of squared deviations, c ( Y - Y ) ,\nwhere Y is the estimated value, is less than it would be for\nany other possible straight line. The minimum condition criterion of calculus is applied to the exp,ression obtained from\nthe least-squares condition to get the so-called "normal equations" from which the expressions for the parameters are obtained.\nThe validity of estimated regression equations is ascertained\nn!\nwith statistics such as t, coefficient of determination, a i\nalso by\'simply observing if the signs of the parameters are in\naccordance with intuition.\nThe regression analysis can be performed quite easily with\nmodern computer capabilities. Standard software packages exist\n(SPSS)) which\n(e.g. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences\nare inexpensive and easy to use. Regression analysis is used\nextensively for forecasting purposes in various disciplines.\nFor example, in macroeconomic literature, a number of authors\nhave used the technique either directly or as a part of a\nsimultaneous equation approach. In business forecasting, the\ntechnique was used to project sales of various industrial\n\n-\n\n-20-\n\nproducts. In travel demand forecasting, regression anqlysiS was\nwidely employed to compute trip generation and trip ahtradtion\n0\nequations.\nAs illustrations of the application of correlation dnalysis,\nreference (201, (21)( 2 2 ) are concerned with correlation studies\nin the domestic 2nd international air cargo markets, while (23)\nexamines the correlation between socio-economic variable and\nair commuter traffic\n\n.\n\n(b)\n\nTrend Correlation Analysis\n\nTrend correlation analysis is used to interpolate or\nextrapolate a time series based on the trend of a related series\nwhose observed values or projections are readily available.\nTrend correlation analysis is sometimes used in estimating zomponents of Gross National Product where annual time series data\nmay have to be converted into quarterly data. In order to use\ntwo or more trends to determine the trend of the variable of\ninterest, the forecaster must establish the relationship between\nthe related series and the variable under consideration. The\ntrends of the independent variables may then be obtained in\norder to compute the forecast of the dependent variable. There\nis a simple version of trend correlation analysis called "precursor events" forecasting. In this case, the progress trends\nbetween two developments, @ne of which leads the other, are\nobserved. Lenz ( 4 ) Gses the precursor events technique to forecast the trend of transport aircraft speed based on combat aircraft speed trends.\n(c)\n\nGeneral Comments on--.Correlation Analysis\n\nThere are several pr-oblems involved with correlation\nanalysis and the regression ttxhniques normally used.\n(i) Choice of variables--One can, of course, exa.mine\nthe effect of an unlimited number of variables (their significance\nis determined by the regression technique) but this requires an\nextensive data base which becomes a costly and time consuming\nproposition. Hence a more restricted selection is usually made\nbased, \'for air transportation work, on such factors as:\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n\npopulation\ndisposable income\neducation level\ngross national product\nemployment\ntime\ncost\n\n-21-\n\n(ii) Accuracy of the data-- As pointed out repeatedly\nby the participants in the 1975 MIT Workshop on Transportation\nDemand, ( 2 4 1 , accurate data, Froperly disaggregated and summarized,\nsimply does not exist to the extent that economic models can be\nderived which are reliable.\n(iii) Variable interdependence--There appears to be\na high degree of interdependence or collinearity between the\nvariables which affect transportation systems. Not only is it\ndifficult to identify these relationships before considerable\ndata analyses has been done, but there is also the risk of overlooking their existence and thus drawing erroneous conclusions\nfrom the derived r,iodels. Techniques are available for overc3ming some of the difficulties, but their success seems to\ndepend on increasing complexity, time and cost, as well as ircreasing demands in the data bank requirements. The sn,aller\nsize of the data bank, the more serious the problem.\n(iv) Transferability--There is not yet any conclusi.,\nindication that model coefficients end exponents derived on the\nbasis of a data bank acquired in some specific locale or s j of\nrt\n"institutional circunstance" are universally applicable with\ndata acquired elsewhere. In fact the evidence is that they are\nnot.\nr\n(v) Estimation o \' the independent variables--Perhaps\nth2 qrentest problem of all, when usinq econometric models for\nforecasting, is that the job of predicfing the future of some\naviation activity is simply shifted to that of predicting the\nfuture trend of several socioeconomic variables which are\nbelieved to control the aviation activity. This implies that,\nas in the case of trend extrapolation, the extent to which\nthese variables control the phenomenon of interest will remain\nconstant with timn--which is certainly questionable. It also\nimplies that the forecaster expects that the future of these\ncontrol variables can bc predicted with much greater accuracy\nthan the phenomeonon of interest--or that 15th a sufficient\nnumber of variables, compensating errors in their future prediction can save the day. When engaging in this latter aspect,\nthe large expenditure in data collection and analyses must be\nquestioned when the results are little more than what might\nbe obtained on the basis of using professional judgmerrt.\n(vi) Serial correlation--This refers to situations\nwhere the value\'of one error term is not independen, of the\nnext. Positive serial correlation occurs when an error term\ntends to be followed by another of the same sign. It may also\noccur when some kind of dynamic adjustment process takes place\nbut the estimat.ion is done in terms of a static model. Serial\ncorrelation may indicate the existence of missing variables\nthat shculd be in the relationship.\n\n-22-\n\nOne of the major values of econometric models seems to be\nthe identification of the socioeconomic variables which in the\npast, under a set of carefully specified circumstances, have\nbeen proven to have a positive or negqtive influence on the\naviation activity. This information is then of great value to\nforecasters who are operating on the basis of professional judgment, either in the direct postulation of forecasts or in the\nchecking of the predictions of other devices such as time-series\nanalysis or ratio methods.\n(3)\n\nTime\n\nSeries Analysis\n\nA time series is a set q f statistical observations\narranged in chronological order. -\'ime series analysis is concerned with data which are not independent, but serially correlated, and where the relations between consecutive observations\nare of interest. Examples of time series of this nature include\nstock prices, in?-strial production, and national income. In\neach of thess series, the level at any point in time depends\nupon the levels achieved in preceding periods. The techniques\nof analyzing a time series may be categorized into three major\nsubdivisions, namely (i) classical time series analysis, (ii)\nexponentid and adaptive smoothing models, and (iii) mathematical time series analysis.\n(a) Classical Time Series Analysis\n\n(25)\n\nThe traditional or classical method of time\nseries analysis i-s descriptive in nature and does not provide\nany statements concerning the future. Essentially, the method\nattempts to break a time seri.es into major components which\nrepresent the effects of the operation of gioups of explanatory\nfactcrs that are the primary determinants of the time series.\n(i) Seculsr Trend\nSecular trend refers to the smooth upward\nor downward movement over a long period of time. Secular trend\nmovements are attributable to factors such as population change,\ntechnological progress, and large-scale shifts in consumer\ndemands. Analytical techniques used with this type are usually\nquite simple ranging from free hand curve sketching to a simple\n"best fit" using regression analysis.\n(ii) Cyclical Fluctuations\nCyclical fluctuations or business cycle\nmovements are recurrent up and down movements arouna seciilar\ntrend levels. In business cyc1.s the period of expa.ision ends\nat the peak, or upper turning point, and then moves inta contraction which terminates at the lower turning point, the\ntrough. These phases repeat themselves, with a different\n\n-23-\n\nduration and amplitude. In this case analysis is usually done\nby what is known as the cyclical relative method (CR), which can\nbe stated tersely as follows: If y is an annual time series\nwith components trend, T, cyclical fluctuations, c, and irregular m~vements, I, and if Yt is the trend value, then\n\n= T x C x I = C x I\n\nCR=Y/\nYt\n\n?\n\n(iii) Seasonal. Variations\nSeasonal variations are periodic patterns\nof movement in a time series. The movement completes itself\nwithin the period of 3 calendar year and continues in a repetition of the basic paLtern. The major factors in producing these\nannually repetitive patterns of seasonal variations are weather\nar.d customs. Three methods are customarily used to determine\nthis component.\n\n. Ratio-to-moving point average:\nIf Y = original quarterly cbservations\nM A = moving average figures (containing trend and cycli-\n\ncal components)\nT = trend components\nC = cvclical components\nS = seasonal components\nt = irregular components\nthen\nY/m\n\n=\n\nTxC x\n\ns\n\nx I/T\n\n=\n\ns x I.\n\naveraging these values of Y/MA accomplishes elimination of the\nirregular mmponent.\nLink relative method (discussed above)\nPercentage of annual averages method\nEach quarter is expressed as a percentage\ncf the a \'erage for the year. The averages\nof these figures for each quarter over all\nyears are then the seasonal indices\n(iv) Irregular Movements\nIrregular movements are ,uctuations in a time\nseries which are erratic in nature, and follow no discernible\npattern. These movements are sometimes referred to as residual\nvariations, since, by definition, they are residuals in a time\nseries after the trend, cyclical, and seasonal components are\naccounted for.\n\\,KLGWAI, PAGE I."\n-24OF POOR QUAUrr\n\nClassical tine series analysis is based on the assumption\nthat various time series components are independent of each\nother. Analyzing the time series after decomposing the same\ninto components, though very useful for descriptive purposes,\nis grossly artificial. This is true especially in the case of\nforecasting. Hence, in forecasting with time series components,\ncombination projections are used to reflect the interactions\nof the components. For instance, in short-term forecasting,\na combined trend-seasonal projection is a common technique. In\na company\'s forecast of next year\'s sales by months, a projection\nof the trend of annual sales might be distributed among months\nusing seasonal indices. A comprehensive forecast might also\ninvolve adjusting with cyclical prediction. Cyclical movements\nare more difficult to forecast than trend and seasonal elements.\nThe cyclical fluctuations in a specific time series are generally\ninfluenced by general business cycle movements characteristic of\nlarge sectors of the overs11 economy. Specifically, any\neconomic series, while exhibiting a certain amount of commonality in business cycle fluctuations, displays differences in\ntiming and amplitude. The National Bureau of Economic Research\nhas studied these differences and classified the time series into\nthree groups, namely, (i) leading series, (ii) coincident series,\nand (iii) lagging series. These statistical indicators are adjusted for seasonal movements and published monthly in "Business\nConditions Digest," by the Bureau of the Census, and in "Economic\nIndicators," by the Council of Economic Advisors. For the most\npart, these indicators are useful in the prediction of cyclical\nturning points. For example, if most of the "leading indicators"\nmove in an opposite direction from the prevailing phase of t l\nie\ncyclical activity of bllsiness interest, this is an indication\nof a possible turning point in the business cycle. A subsequent\nsimilar movement by a majority of "coincident indicators" would\nbe considered a confirmation that a cyclical turn w - in progress.\n~\nA diffusion index is another type of cyclical prediction tool.\nThis index utilizes the ffct that various economic series attain\ntheir peak and trough levels at different points in time. The\nindex is defined as the percentage of seasonally adjusted series\nwhich are expanding at a given point in time. When the percentage drops below 50, it may be taken that a peak has been reached\nand that contraction in the aggregate activity is beginning.\nDiffusion indices are generally regarde2 by economists as effective early warning signals of impending turning points in overall\neconomic activity.\nSeveral of the articles reviewed in Appendix A and included\nin Table 2 are bzsed on classical time series analysis e.g.\nMaio ( 2 6 ) and the two Boeing articles on international and\ndomestic freight ( 2 7 ) ( 2 8 ) .\n\n-25-\n\n(b) Exponential and Adaptive Smoothing Models\n\nExponential smoothing uses a weighted moving average\nof past data as the basis for a forecast. The weights\n( 0 < a < 1) are a geometric progression with smaller weights\nas-srgneato observations in the more distant past. The smoothed\nvalue of X (variable of interest) is given by :\n\nasn\n\n+\n\n=, it can be shown that\n\nThe forecast in time period (t+l) is made equal to the\nlatest smoothed value of X. The above smoothing procedure is\napplicable to series which do not exhibit trend and seasonality.\nThe trend and seasonality adjustments are made with factors\ncomputed as exponentially smoothed estimates. Various types of\nadjustment procedures are described in the literature. For\nexample, Winters (29) presents an exponential forecasting equation which incorporates bath trend and seasonal adjustment\nfactors. The smooth equation is given by\n\nFt-L\n\nwhere Rt\' the trend adjustment factor, is given by\n\nand Ft, the seasona1it.y factor is given by\n\nwhere L is the number of periods in the seasonal cycle, and a,B,\nand y are the forecasting parameters. The estimates of a , S , and\ny are obtained by minimizing the sum of squares of forecast errors\nin an iterative procedure. The forecast errors are cqmputcld for\ncombinations of a,B, and y a3d the combination that g i v e s the\nsmallest error is taken as the estimate. Adam, et al. (30) describe a "grid search" procedure to estimate the value of a parameter in a single parameter equation as a two-step procedure.\nFirst, the smoothing constant is varied by 0.1 increments. Once\nthe minimum error range is located, the saoothinq constant is\n-26\n\n-\n\nvaried by 0.01, The authors allude to a "pattern search\' procedure in the case of two or more parameter estimates. I? contrast to the procedures employed above, if the parameters are\ndynamically updated, the model is termed an adaptive smoothing\nmodel. TLe parameter values are determined each period using a\ntracking signal suggested by Trigg and Leach ( 3 1 ) .

For major changes in the demand, large forecast\nerrors will result as compared to the period immediately before\nthe major change, and the tracking signal reflects this change.\nEstimating the values of the parametersa,B,y,v, K1, and K2 is\na combinatorial problem generally solved by means of simulation.\n(c) Mathematical Time Series Analysis\nLike classical analysis, the formal or mathematical\ntime series analysis is concerned with data which are not independent, but serially correlated. Recently, mathematical\ntime series analysis has r-,:ceivedmuch attention as evidenced\nby research and literature. A notable procedxe of anall-zing\ntime series mathematically is that of Box and Jenkins (32).\nThe Box-Jenkins approach is so involved and complex that it is\nperhaps not fitting to include it in an exposition of basic\nnature. However, an attempt is made below to presert the\nfundamental concepts of the approach and introduce the reader\nto more sophisticated material as presented in references ( 3 2 1 ,\n( 3 3 ) , and ( 3 4 ) .\nFirst Box and Jenkins describe a class of stable linear\nstatistical models.called AX(p) class, MA(q) class, and A M\n( p , q ) class. The general form of the AR(p) class, i.e.,\n\n-27-\n\n"autogressive process of order p," is given by\n\nwhere the current value of the process is zxpressed as a weighted\nsum of past values plus the current shcck. Zi can be considered\nto be regressed on its own previous values, hence the name. The\ngeneral form of the MA(q) class, i.e., "moving average process of\norder q," is given by\nZi = a; + Olai-l\n\ni....+\n0\n\nI\n\nqai-q.\n\nThe general form of the ARMA (p,q) class, which contains both\nclasses is given by\n\nAFtip) as? i\'A(q)\n\nzi -\n\n$lzi-l+....+\n\nz\n\n+....+ 8qai-q.\nP i-P + ai + Olai-l\nBox-Jenkins\' approach then proceeds to describe an identification procedure whereby a given time series can be identified\nas belonging to a certain class. The identification phase consists of computing series mean, variance, autocorrelation function {yk}, a l partial autocorrelation function { $ \' .) to ascerid\nos%rn\nwhere\ntain the\'class of the model. This is done by c n ! e i g\nthe cutoffs, if pny, occur in the {ek}, the population aatocorrelation function and {Q k}, the population partial autocorrelation function, by cokparing the estimated functions with\ntheir large-lag standard errors, and then seeing whether the\nresults fit any of the theoretical patterns. Values of p and q\nare thus obtained. Having identified a tentative model, the next\nstage is to estimate the parameters using the rough values calculated in the identification stage as initial values. Box and\nJenkins describe a nonlinear least squares procedurehto 9btain\nthe vector of parameter estimates ($,;)\n= (,$1\n$\n,I\nel,\n?\n\n...,\n\n...,\n\nh\n\n8 ) which minimizes the error\n\n9\n\nsum of squares\n\n1\nThe next step in the Box-Jenkins approach is to verify the\nestimated model for its adequacy. In the AR(p), MA(q), and\nARMA(p,q) models mentioned above, the order of the operators p\nand q is important as unnecessary increases in the order may\nlead to parameter redundancy and inadequate order may underidentify a model, One approach is to identify and estimate\nvarious models (i.e., models with different orders of operators)\nwhich seem to fit t.he series and apply a x 2 - test. Once the\nmodel is identified, estimated, and verified, it is ready for\nORIGINAL PAGE I\nb\n-28-\n\nOF POOR QUAdsTy\n\nforecasting purposes. Anderson ( 3 3 ) presents two variants of\nthe ARMA model, namely the ARIMA (p,q) (autoregressive integrated\nmoving average) model and the IMA (p,q) (autoregressive integrated\nmoving average) model, and proves that the IMA (1,l) model is the\nsame as the famous exponential smoothing formula used by many\nforecasts in forecasting sales of industrial products (exponential smoothing is described in the preceding pages).\n(d)\n\nGeneral Comments on Time Series Analyses\n\nMost of the advantages and disadvantages of time series\nanalyses have already been discussed. However it is well to emphasize that the major drawbacksare probably the requirements\nfor accurate data, and the assumption that what has happened in\nthe past will continue into the future. The data requirement is\nparticularly severe, especially since historical information is\nneeded. In many cases it simply does not exist in a useful forn;,\nand the reliability is doubtful. This infers that most time\nseries studies are done using data from standard governmentcollection cource:\nHowever, there is no guarantee that these\'data\nrepresent the factors which are most important in controlling the\nphenomenon under study.\n(4)\nCross Seztional Analysis\nGenerically, these models are constructed such that\ncalibration can be based on a mass of data about demand between\ndifferent O-D pairs taken at a single point in time, although\nthey can also be constructed to permit inclusions of time\ndependent projections of zona?.;>roperties (i.e., properties at\n0 or D).\nOne of the major model types included under this category\nis the "gravity model," so named because its form is similar\nto the two-body equation for gravitational attraction. Although\nthere are a variety of gravity models with varying degrses of\nsophisticatign, they all stem from the basic concept that transportation demand depends primarily on two factors: (a) the\ndesire for travel between two points (called a mutual attractiveness term) denotsd as P.P where the P\'s represent some function\n1 i\nof Properties Of the zondS : and (b) a term which represents the\ncapability for travel between i and j which can be expressed\neither as an impedance Iijk or a conductance K ijk (note that they\nare specific to a given mode k).\nHence the demand for travel between i and j on a given mode\n\nk is\n\n-29-\n\nThe f o r e c a s t e r must choose t h e p r o p e r t i e s , P , and t h e mode\nc h a r a c t e r i s t i c s , I.

These are generally related to the fact that\nthe calibration data must depend upon user perception, and when\nnew modes or changes in modal characteristics are introduced, it\ni s difficult to forecast how this will be perceived by the user.\nFinally, one encounters a aniversal-type problem, viz.,\nin trying to "fix" the models to overcome deficiencies like those\nindicated above, one generally risks introducing one or more new\nproblems which are equal to or worse than the one solved.\nThe work of Melvin Brown of Mitre Corp. ( 3 5 ) typifies\nsome of the most advanced work done with gravity models; that\nof Thorsen and Brewer ( 3 6 ) and Wilson and Stevens (37) illustrates how many attercpts at analyzing cross sectional data ultimately end up in the gra~-tyform: and the paper by Brom,and\nWatkins ( 3 8 ) is interesting in that it compares the results of\nforecasting in the same market using both time series and cross\nsectional data. Finally, the Northeast Corridor Transportation\nProject has done extensive work in the modeling and modal split\nanalysis of transportation demand. See for example Mclynn (39)\nSystms Analysis and Research Corporation ( 4 0 ) and National\nAnalysts, Inc. (41)\n(5)\n\nCategory Analysis ( 4 2 )\n\nCategory analysis or cross-classification analysis is\na technique for estimating the characteristics of entities which\nhave been sorted into a number of separate categories. Category\nanalysis is used in travel demand forecasting where the number\nof trips produced by a specific category of travellers in a zone\nis of interest. With reference to travel demand forecasting, the\ncharacteristic is the nunber of trips and the entities are the\nhouseholds who travel. Entities may be categorized by subdividing them into smaller groups such as l-person households, 2\nperson households, etc., and each subdivision of households is\nfurther subdivided accordina to car ownership rates. For example,\nthe 1-, 2-person households mentioned above may be dived accordto l-person, O-car households, l-person, l-car households, etc.\nIn the general case, if p . (c) is the number of characteristics\n(of the same type) obserdd in the category c entity in spatial\nunit i, h. ( c ) is the number of entities in spatial unit i in\ncategory E , and tp(c) is the characteristic observance rate of\nentities in category c, then the characteristic ovservance rate\nduring the base year is given by\n\n-31-\n\nand the forecast for the horizon year is given by\n\n.-\n\n.A\n\n. tp(c) = tp(c)\n\nx Hi(c)\n\nwhere\'H>(cj\' are the number of entities durinb the horizon year.\nThe category models are generally tested for significance by\nmeans of a statistical technique called analysis of variance.\nIn category analysis the characteristic of interest is categorized and subcategorized into various levels which is reminiscent\nof the factorial designs used in statistics. In factorial designs\nboth qualitative and quantitative factors can be used and the\ndesigns do not require linearity of relationship between variables,\nthus eliminating need for any transformation of variables. The\ndata for factorial analysis are presented in matrix form in the\nsame way category models are developed. From the standpoint of\nformat, category models seem to be natural candidates for factorial analysis for significance testing.\nC.\n\nAnalytical Objective Methods\n\n(1) Simultaneous Equation Approach\nContrary to the approach taken in least-squares\nregression where the parameters i n regression equations are\ndetermined independently, the simultaneous equation approach\ndetermines the parameter values of constituent equations from\nwhat are called "reduced-form equations." The essential difference between the least-squares regression method and the simultaneous equation method is illustrated by means of an example\n(43).\nThe example consists of a system of two equations depicting the relationships between disposable income and consumer\nexpenditures:\nYt =\n\net + zt\n\n.. . (1)\n\nwhere\nYt = disposable income per capita\nCt = consumer expenditures per capita\nZt = investment expenditures per capita, autonomous\na\n\n= marginal propensity to consume\n\n6\n\n= C-intercept of the consumption \xe2\x82\xacunction, and\n\nut = the random element in consumers\' behavior.\n\n-32-\n\nIn the least-squares method, regression of consumers\' expenditures (Ct1 on disposable income (, is taken directly. To\ny)\ntake the least-squares regression of C\nt as the true con)\nt On \'\nsumption function, however, is to assume that y is completely\nindependent Of C , i.e., to assume that random Seviations in\nconsumers\' expenhtures about the consumption function can take\nplace independent of the disposable income. However, this is not\npossible as long as Zt in the equation y = C + 2 is considered\nt\nas autonomous. Zt is regarged as autonomous t this example and\nin t\nso yt cannot be completely independent of Ct. The least-squares\napproach, if applied to such an equation system, yields inconsistent estimators. The simultaneous-equation approach draws\nattention to this inconsistency bias of the least-squares approach,\nwhere the independent variable(s) are not completely independent\nof the dependent variable. The first step in the simultaneous\nequation approach is to reduce equations (in this case, equations\n(1) and ( 2 ) to equations showing nothing on the right side but the\nautonomous variable, Zt, as shown below:\nCt = ayt + B\n\n+ ut\n\nCt = a(Ct + Zt) + 8 + ut\nCt (1-a) = aZt\n\n+\n\nR +\n\nU\n\nt\n\nEquations (1.1) and (2.1) are called reduced-form eqcations.\nSince the investment is considered autonomous (i.e., completeiy\nindependent of consumers\' expenditures and disposable income),\nthe least-squares method if applied on (1.1) and ( 2 . 1 ) will\nyield consistent estimators. The simultaneous equation approach\nis extensively used in the forecasting of many areas, especially\nwhere complex interrelationships will have to be portrayed in\nthe form of a systefi of equations. The method is amenable to\nsophisticated statistical techniques and tests, and is taken for\ngranted by many analysts, economists, and other forecasting professionals as a reasonable way of making some probability statements about the future.\n(2)\n\nInput-Output Analysis\n\nInput-output analysis ( 4 4 ) was initially developed\nas a tool for analjrzing the structure of the national economy.\nHowever, by virtue of its specific character, this powerful\ntechnique found a place in such fields as energy, pollution,\ntransportation, etc.\nInput-output analysis, as a forecasting\n-33-\n\nt e c h n i q u e , c a n b e s t be e x p l a i n e d by means of a n example.

Input-output analysis helps\nto quantify changes in general equilibrium in a convenient\nmanner so as to enab7e one to forecast future output once the\nfuture demands are projected.\n(3)\n\nAnalogy Methods\n\nMethods of forecasting which are analogous to biological growth models are developed by a number of authors. A\nmajority of analogy models are dzv2loped to forecast technological progress. According to Lenz, (4) attempts to develop a\ntheory explaining why technological progress should proceed in\nan exponential manner date back to the early twentieth century\nwith the theory advanced b y Henry Adams (45). Adams relates\nthe technological progress to the force of attraction between\nmasses. Derek de Solla Price ( 4 6 ) proposes a logistic growth\ncurve of the form\n\nto explain technological progress.\nbiological growth formula\n\nThis is similar to Pearl\'s(47)\n\nP =\n\n1 + A exp (-kt1\nwhere P is the population at time t, P9 was the population at\nthe beginning of the experiment, and A and k are parameters.\nApart from convenience, logistic functions of the above type\nare preferred by some technological forecasters due to the\nreason that logistic functions exhibit deviations of the actual\ntrend from idealized exgonentials.\nLogistic growth formulae of the type described by Pearl\nand utilized by others in the area of technological forecasting\nare based on the superficial resemblance between the actual\nprocesses involved, i.e., biological growth and teehnological\ngrowth\'processes. Hut the questions are:\na. Is a technological growth process really similar to a\nbiological growth proces,? For example, is an increase\nin knowledge the same as an increase in population?\nb. An exponential growth assumes a constant rate of charge.\nNhy should one assume a constant rate of change, say, in\ntechnological forecasting?\n\nRidenour (48) and a few others tuok a fresh look at\nmechanisms which would explain the behavior of technological\ntrends, rather than accepting a biologicai grawth process as\nan equivalent of the technological growth process. However,\nan exponential increase was accepted as a general "law of\n-35-\n\nsocial change" ( 4 9 ) . Ridenour assumes that the rate of acceptance of a technology is a function of potential users who have\nbeen exposed to such technology. If N is the number of potential\nusers and K is a proportionality constant\n\nHowever, the author suggests that K is a fluxtion of the type\nK = k(1-N 1 where L ;.s the tlpper limit of potential users. Thus\n\nE\n\nt . e rate of change will approach zero as L approaches N. When\n;h\nGhe expression for K is substituted in dN/dt and integrated,\nw have\ne\nN(t) =\n\nL\n1 + h-\n\n0\n\n-\n\nL\n1) exp (-kt)\n\nwhich is equivalent to the logistic growth curve Fresented above.\nThe author, despite his intentions not to accept a biological\ngrowth process, ends up with the same to explain the technological growth process. Furthermore, the link between the author\'c\nformula ard technolo9ical change seems to be quite subtle.\nHartman (50) considers information gain as a prelude to\ntechnologic21 gain and susgests that\ndI(t) = KNI\ndt\nt 1 e e I is the information in bits, N is the number of scientists,\nr;r\nand K is the probability that a scientist encountering a bit of\ninformation will add another bit of information.

Further, the author assumes that no extrar.ectus factors limit the addition t f new knowledge.\nIsenson (51) suggests that the rate of increase of information follows a polynomial treiid of the form\n\n[N\n\ndI (t) = K\ndt\n\n(t) + AN2(t)]\n\nwhere I(t) is the amount cf information at time t and N ( L ) is\nthe ncmber of scientists.

Broadly speaking,\nin the "simulation" approach, we construct a model of ar existr\ning or hypothetical system and examine the behavior of the\nsystem in an artificially created static or dynamic environment.\nDynamic simulation models are of interest in our case as such\nmodels specify the time period explicitly. The advantage of a\nsimulation approach is that it makes no specific attempt to\nisolate the relationships between any particular variables;\ninstead, it observes the way in which vtriables of the model\nvary with time. Once the relationships are derived from the\navailable data, these relationships are projected into the\nfuture. Two commonly employed simulation approaches to forecasting are the simultaneous recursive euuation approach where\na system of equations are interconnected te1nGorarily and the\nIn the ?imulso-called "industrial dynamics" approach (53)\ntaneoiis equation system, a number of dependent variables are\npostulated as autoregressive functions with any number of exogenous variables and the parameters are estimated. The resulting e--:ations are then used recursively for any number of\nfuture time periods, provided the exogenous variables are completely specified over the period of interest.\n\n.\n\nAn industrial dynamics view of a system concentrates on\nthe rates at which various quantities change apd expresses the\nrates as continuous variables. The industrial dynamics framework consists of levels, rates, and rate equations. The levels\nrepresent the accumulation of various entities in the system\nsuch as inventories of goo?s, capital stock, etc. The current\nvalue of a level at any time represents the accumulated difference between the input and output flow f o r that level. Rates\nare definer; to represent the instantaneous flow to or from ii\nlevel. Decision functions or rate equations determine how the\nflow rates depend upon the levels. Decision functions depend\nupon the system\'s prevailing conditions.\nA hiqhly debated example which used the industrial dynamics\napproach to technological forecasting is "The Limits to Growth"\n(54).\nThis project, which aroused worldwide attention, is an\nambitious effort to forecast complex phenomena. It assumed that\nfive variables: population, industrial output, foad production,\n\n-39-\n\ndepletion of non-renewable resources, and . .llution of the environment were the "triggering" variables. The "Limits to\nGrowth" projects the trsnds of these variables into the future\nan a globally-aggregated basis and concludes that a continuation of current trends will lead inevitably to catastrophic malfunctioning of the world system within the next century. The\nmodel consists essentially of a large number of difference\nequations expressing causal links. Projections are based on the\nassumptions on which the equations rest and thus, as in any\nforecasting approach, their credibility is dependent on the\nvalidity of assumptions. Some economists and other professionals\nare critical of "The Limits to Growth" alleging that some of the\nauthors\' assumptions are misrepresentations of reality and so are\ninvalid. In any case, "The Limits to Growth" is a bold venture\ninto the future and simulation as an instrument made that possible.\nGeneral Comments\nSpecific applications of the analytical objective\nmethods to transportation demand forecasting are not numerous undoubtedly because of the complexity involved. Although the\nsimultaneous equation approach is a standard technique for\nhandling expressions containing interdependent variables, the\nuse of such variables is usually avoided by most workers in the\nfield. This may be unfortunate since there is no fundamental\nreason to suspect that demand processes are controlled by\nvariables that are independent. In addition to the reference\ncited above, the subject is also discussed by Eriksen et a1 in\na study of the relationship between air transportation demand\nand level of service ( 5 5 ) .\nSimulation is becoming more popular, but it suffers from\nrequirements f o r extensive computer software and enormous\namounts of data. One interesting study in the air cargo field\nusing simulation was that done by Roberts et al. in analyzing\nthe potential for lighter-than-air vehicles ( 5 6 )\n(d) Combined Methods\n\n(1) Behavioral Modeling\nThe choice of a transport mode is a human\ndecision, regardless of whether it is for the transport of\npassengers or freight. T h u s it seems logical that the factors\nwhich have a major influence on human preferences under a given\nset of circumstances would be expected to exert an important\ndegree of control over this mode selection process. In order\nto approach the subject from this point of view, it is necessary to combine the subjective and objective methods. The important variables must be determined and the data relating to\nthose variables obtained on a subjective basis from those\naffected by the system. Using these data objective methods,\nusually empirical in nature, are applied to develop models from\nwhich forecasts can be obtained.\n-40-\n\nThese factors have received much more attention of late in\nthe forecasting of passenger traffic, but are rarely used in air\ncargo forecasting. There is no questioning the difficulties involved in defining and quantifying the behavioral variables and\nthe situation is probably an order of magnitude worse for cargo\nthan for passengers.\n\nIn the first place it is difficult to define the variables\nwhich are significant. The list of potential candidates is long,\nbut an extensive amount of work is now underway to try to make\norder out of this compl2x problem. To say the least, behavioral\nmodeling is a problem of the first degree in disaggregate analysis.\nGenerally the variables can be classified under four very\nbroad headings:\n\nre--\n\nDemo raphic--Who are the trip originators and where are\nthey ocated? Usually classified here are such things as age,\nsex, race, religion, location, population demity, etc.\nMotivational--To where are the trips going and why are they\nbeing made. Typl\'cal variables involved are: trip purpose, past\nexperiences with modes, impressions formed through advertising\nor comunication with others, etc.\n~~\n\nSocioeconomic--To what extent is the freedom of modal choice\navailable to the trip originator? This is often governed by\neducation, income, type of employment, family size, home ownership, health and Gthers.\nSystem Characteristics--What is it about the system that\nthe trip originator must react to in making a final selection?\nThis category is particularly complex, with major variables\nstxch as: safety, dependability, time, convenience, cost,\ncomfort, aesthetics, ability to use time, etc. Many of these\nhave subsets of descriptors. For example, comfort involves all\npossible degrees of freedom of motion (their rates, accelerations, and changes in accelerations), noise, temperature,\nhumidity, air quality and seat accommodations. Furthermore,\nall of these variables must be applied to a variety of possible\ntrip components which can all be grouped into three major categories: access to the.main vehicle, use of the main vehicle,\nand egress from the main vehicle.\nThe next problem is that of obtaining data. Fortunately\nthe fundamentals of statistical science, are available to assist\nin the planning and analysis and these principles are adhered\nto very carefully by those who have made significant contributions to the field. Nevertheless, execution of the techniques\nis not simple, and this combined with the large number of\nvariables and their many inter-relations makes the tasks difficult and progress slow and relat.ively costly.\n\n-41-\n\n(2)\n\nMarket Research\n-\n\nIn its broadest sense behabiural modeling must be considered as a form of what the business community loosely calls\nmarket research. There are many forms of market research and\nit means different things to different people. Thus care must\nbe used in any discussion of such a universal .topic. Part cf\nthe problem is illustrated by a typical definition of the process\nas presented by Chambers, et a1 ( 5 7 ) : "The systematic formal and\nconscious procedure for evolving and testing hypotheses about real\nmarkets". However, upon examining most of the effort discussed\nin this paper, it is found that the emphasis is on the marketing\nof products. Unfortunately there are significant differences\nbetween product sales and the offering of services such as trensportation. Some of these may be outlined as follows:\nFirst, the process of marketing services has four unique\ncharacteristics when compared to marketing products:\na.\n\nThe service canhot be inventoried to match fluctuations in demand:\n\nb\n.\n\nThe service is personalized--each individual wants\nthe service to match their own perception;\n\nc.\n\nThere is no equivalent of the "replacement of bad\nproduct" concept; and\n\nd.\n\nIt is difficult to check quality prior to the final\nsale.\n\nNext, a i r transportation is different from mGst other\nservice in one or more of the following ways:\na.\n\nIt is a demand derived from a need other than that\nof simply taking a journey for its own sake:\n\nb.\n\nIt is under considerable government control (although\nthis is now being relaxed somewhat, particularly in\nthe air cargo field) ;\n\nc.\n\nDelivery aspects cannot be guaranteed ( e . g . , bad\nweather) ; and\n\nd.\n\nIt is oniy producible in batches, i.e. once a vehicle\nhas been scheduled only a certain amount of space is\navailable, and it is difficult to change this on short\nnotice.\n\nThe implications of these factors in air transportation\nresult in three principal areas. First, constraints are imposed\non the selection of variables which can be used as subjective\nmeasures. Second, the sources of data are mare limited and most\n-4 2-\n\nORIGINAL PAGE k\nOF POOR QUAILIm\n\nof the essential information must be obtained through direct\ncontact with the groups of individuals involved. Finally, care\nmust be exercised in identifying subject populations and sample\ngroups within those populations.\nActually the market research techniques in the transportation field take on several forms depending on the type of transportation service involved. In air transportation, they range\nfrom records of vehicle activities or head counts (e.g. FAA\nstatistics on the number of aircraft operations at various airports ( 5 8 ) , or CAB origin - destination statistics ( 5 9 1 , to\nbehavioral and ettitudinal surveys done by questionnaires or\ninterviews ( 6 0 ) (61), to evaluatiom made by trained test subjects (e.g. as used by the University of Virginia in their work\non the modeling of vehicle ride comfort (61)\nPerhaps the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey can\nbe regarded as the most sophisticated practioner of market\nanalysis in the air transportation field, although most airlines a l s o conduct surveys of their passengers on a regular\nperiodic basis. The PANYNJ work strives to take full advantage\nof disaggregate data and segments its samples into many categories based on one or more variables from each of the four\nmajor groups presented above. There is no doubt that this detailed type of analysis can provide more accurate information\nthan an aggregated approach, but it is certainly more costly\nboth in terms of time and money.\n\nE\n.\n\nEvaluation\n\nIn attempting to conduct an evaluation of the present\nstate of forecasting there are three main aspects to be addressed.\nThe criteria which should be used to select a method for a specific purpose is one concern. Another concern is the ability of\nthe method to produce accurate and reliable forecasts. Intuitively \'this predictive ability should indeed constitute one of\nthe selection criteria. However, when considering air cargo\nforecasting there are not sufficient documented differences\nbetween the accuracy of the various approaches to make this the\nprime criteria. Others are often equally important. Finally,\n\n-43-\n\nthere are several specific issues relating to-the individual\nmethods, or the means for their implementation, which should\nreceive consideration. Each of these aspects will be discugsed\nseparately, preceded by a brief summary of the techniques\ncurrently in use by some of the organizations most actively concerned with air transportation forecasting.\n\n1\n.\n\nTechniques Currently in Use\n\nOver the past ten years there have been three majQr\nreviews of current practices in air travel forecasting by\nCalderone in 1967, (62) b y a m in 1970 (63), and by Haney in\n1975 ( 6 4 ) . These studies are all done from different perspectives, but it is clear that the techniques used by the various\norganizations have remained essentially the same over the years.\nThus the following excerpt taken from Calderone ( 6 2 ) summarizes\nthe practices as concisely as is possible.\n"Airline Companies. Generally, airline companies have\ntaken a relatively simple.approach to forecasting future passenger traffic, employing one or a combination of three methods:\n(1) executive judgment, ( 2 ) trend and cycle analysis, and ( 3 )\ncorrelation analysis. Of these, the first two are used most\nfrequently and, of the two, judgment plays the most prominent\nrole. While the airlines consider a number of factors in preparing their forecasts, they seem to consider that current and\nanticip-ted levels of economic activity are of primary importance. They statistically analyze only a few indices, however,\nand of these the most commonly chosen is GNP.\nGovernment, Trade, and Aircraft Manufacturing Organizations.\nThese organizations usitally employ the following techniques:\n(1) linear or curvilinear projections of historic trends, ( 2 )\nsimple or multiple correlation analysis ( 3 ) executive judgment,\n( 4 ) economic models, ( 5 ) statistical and mathematical formulas,\nand ( 6 ) marketing surveys.\nDemand studies made by airlines or aircraft manufacturers\nfall within distinguishable classifications according to the\nlength of the forecast period.\n(1) Short-range predictions of up to one year periods\nare generally the product of trend projections of\npassenger and/or revenue growth. Such predictions are\nmade either for a segment of the industry, or for the\nentire industry, or for some specific airline.\n(2)\n\nLonger-range predictions always include behavioral\nanalyses of one or a number of general economic\nactivity.indices (most frequently GNP, national income,\ndisposable personal incone, consumer price level,\nretail sales, or industrial production). It is\n\n-44-\n\nassumed that there are some relatively stable relationships between the general economic activity growth and\nthat of transportation (general or air), and therefore\npopulation and employment trends are studied. The\nnumber and relationship of variables vary, but what is\ngenerally used is a combination of traffic trend projections in conjunction with or modified by expected\ntraffic as a function of exogenous n\'ational economic\nindices. The forecasts are usually made for the entire\nnational air travel market. Divisions of total projected traffic among the various airlines are generally\npredicted or anticipated market shares which are assumed\nto be functions of pricing, equipment plans, etc."\n2.\n\nSelection Criteria\n\nAt the outset of the study it was hoped that it would be\npossible to make a clearcut evaluation of various forecasting\ntechniques based on some set of criteria to be determined.\nIdeally these criteria would emerge fron the review of the\nliterature in a clearly defined state of existence, and a potential user could then score each method against the criteria\nds viewed from the particular purpose of that user - much in\nthe same way in which one might reach an objective decision\nabout purchasing a car or home, or locating a plant. Unfortunately, it soon became apparent that such would not be the case.\nThe complexities, options, redundancies, interdependencies, etc.\namong the various techniques as evidenced by the reviews presented in section D, and the lack of definitive experience with\nthe results of their past applicatLons indicated the difficulties\nto be encountered with this approach. While there are undoubtedly\ntechniques of decision analysis which could be applied to achieve\nthe initial objective to some extent,their use would be well\nbeyond the scope and resources of this study.\nOne of the major problems in considering criteria is that\nthe one criterion which might be expected to be foremost on\nalmost any list, viz accuracy, is difficult to deterniine. In\nfact there have been surprisingly few studies that have tried\nto assess accuracy in any detail. This subject will be addressed\nin more detail in subsection 4 . A l s o it is very difficult if\nnot impossible to define criteria which are mutually independent.\nThus perhaps the most useful way to treat criteria at this time\nis to simply list in a terse taxonomical format those items to\nwhich thought should be given by anyone concerned with the\nselection of a forecasting method for air cargo.

This is true not only\nfor air cargo, where there is a paucity of data available, but\nalso for air passenger transportation where the availability of\ndata is perhaps an order of magnitude better. Furthermore, the\nsame statement can be made for modes other than air, and for\nurban transportation. Thus it appears to be 3 "generic" problem,\nand indeed, the literature does provide insight into some of the\nproblems.\nIn his book on airport systems planning, DeNeufville summarizes some of the basic problems so well that they merit\nrepeating (65)\n"Ultimately, all forecasts are in fact themselve8 based on\ntrend extrapolations. The use of a sophisticated statistical\nmodel to develop a formula giving the amount of air travel as\na function of factors such as national product, average income\nand the like does not eliminate judgment from our estimates of\nfuture conditions. The procedure merely shifts it from air\ntravel to those other quantities whose future may be equally\ndifficult to guess".\nSo far there is no compelling evidrnce that sophisticated statistical techniques provide better forecasts of air\ntraffic than simpler approaches. Althpugh the amount of detail\ninvolved in cemputcrized statistical analysis could Fossibly\nprovide us with an accurate estimate (of transportation demand),\nit usually does not. One rea.son is t.hat, in these analyses\ninvolving hundreds of different factors, we lose the ability\nto apply judgrnent and common sense to each element. We must\ninstead alltx the computer to apply mechanical rules to\ndetermine the influence of each factor on future trends."\nI\n\'\n\n" A furthcr difficulty with stztistical ana1ysis.i~\nthat\nthe predictions are sensitive to the form of the mathematical\nmodel used. Analysts who happen to choose to work with different equations may thus obtain quite different results using\nthe same basic statistics and overall procedure. Although\ndifferent specialists are often adamant about the peculiar\nmerits of their particular approach, no compelling logical\ngrounds exist to discriminate between conflicting, often\narrogant cl.aims. This situation puts authorities responsible\nfor making a choice in a difficult situation: as experts do\nnot agree among themselves, the decision-makers cannot rely\nupon a single analysis or develop ij, firm test of which analyses may be best.\nI\'\n\nOne particularly difficult problem is that of preparing\nforecasts for new systems, or systems which are to incorporate\nuntried operational characteristics. This situatim requires\n\n-47-\n\nan estimate of demand at some future time and place for a transportation system for which there is no information available\nconcerning user or community acceptance. All results under these\ncircumstances can be little better than educated guesses.\nCertainly time series projections are not possible unless there\nis prior experience. The only approach is to attempt to draw\nanalogies with other systems in other areas. We have recently\nconcluded a study (as yet unpublished) of a variety of demand\nforecasts used in the development of\nstate airport system\nplans around the ccmtry. We find that in essence the forecasting methods are not applicable outside the region in which they\nwere developed.\nAnother problem with mathematical and econometric forecasting models developed with statistical techniques is that they\nare totally dependent upon the stability of the data trends in\ntime. Thus they are of minimal value in estimating elasticities\nof the causal variables. The statistical variance of such forecasts is also open to question as the simple ordinary least\nsquares regression frequently introduces a downward bias in\nstandard errors when applied to time series.\nBecause of the factors indicated above, the reliability\nof forecasts decreases with the length of time period for which\nthe forecasts are to apply. Beyond 10 years there is little\nvalue in attempting anything more sophirkicated than expert\njudgment.\nAs a final set of comments, Nutter (19) presents a very\nlucid and concise account of the difficulties inherent in\nmodeling air passenger demand. Because it is so well done and\nequally applicable to the air cargo field, the following extract from his article is presented.\n"In tne broad sense, a mathematical model can be any set\nof rules or procedures which represent some significant aspect\nof a real process. A transportation demand forecasting model,\nin particular a passenger demand model, represents the aggreate\nactions of people. Since travel is a voluntary action, each\nindividual presumably makes a rational decision on whether, when,\nwhere and how to g o . based on his perception of the situation. .k\nWe do not know the details of psychological decision process and\ncertainly do not know each individual\'s perception of the real\nsituation. Most efforts at constructing passenger demand models\nare based on the observed actions of people (i.e., the external\nresults of the internal decision process, when that process l e d\nto action) and on the investigator\'s perception of reality.\nTwo points about passenger demand models should be recognized at the cutset: (1) the data base is usually bad and\n( 2 ) the model is frequently applied to sore situation not in\nthe data base. As to the data base, it is extremely difficult\nto run an experiment with all signif!-car.t factors controlled or\n-48-\n\nor even to make measurements without disturbing the system being\nmeasured. Travel data collection efforts are expensive and the\ninvestigator usually finds that past surveys are limited in\nscope and spotty in location. As to the application of the model,\nif it is to be used as part of a planning effort, the concern\nmust be for a new location, a new time, a new service, or a new\nvehicle. The most critical application comes when the new\nsituation requires extrapolation of the model variables to levels\ncompletely beyond the calibration range.\nThe investigator developing a demand model must select a\nmodel "form" (i.e., equations, Frocedures, logic) which he can\ncalibrate against his data base. Because of the scatter of the\ndata, he may be able to get an acceptable fit for several forms.\nFor the application tc the real problem, he mast rely on the\n"behavior" of the model outside the calibration. He can never\ntruly validate his model against the future to test the accuracy\nof his predictions. At best he can test its ability to predict\nthe past and since the past is much more likely to be limited\nto points inside his calibration range, he camot rigorously\ntest the model behavior."\n4.\n\nAccuracy of Forecasts\n\nTo summarize what has been said above is to reiterate\nthe initial statement of the last section, viz. the ability to\nforecast the demand for transportation services is very poor.\nThe summary report of the 1975 multiagency workshop on air\ntransportation demand (24) explains the situation as follows:\n"2ast forecasting methods have become inadequate for at least\ntwo reasons. First, the trend extrapolations method of forecasting is no longer appropriate due to significant changes in both\nthe economic and operating Onvironments in recent years.\nSecond, the more sonhistica-ed econometric forecasting models\nare only as good as our understanding of the total air transportation System on the one hand, and the availability of data\non the other."\nThe results of this state of affairs can be shcwn graphically in Figures 1 through 4, which have been borrowed from\nHaney\'s survey article (64). Figure 1 shows the history of\nFAA forecasting over the years. The solid line is what actually\nhappened and the various dashed lines represent what FAA was\nforecasting at various periods in time. This illustrates\nvery well the problems with simple trend extrapolation. They\ndo reaso?ably well in the short term, buc fail badly at long\nrange. The influence of external factors is clearly cbservable, e.\xc2\xb6., the industry activity seemed relatively easy to\npredict in the period from 1950-1962, but since then the gyrations have been extensive.\nFigure 2 exarines the hlstory of CAB forecast;.

With tongue in\ncheek, one can conclude that we are approaching the state-ofthe-art where some forecast will be correct--but m l y because\nalmost every imaginabie value is being forecast by someone.\nIt is interesting to note that t h trend in forecasts since the\nlate i . S 6 0 \xc2\xb0 s has always been to the high side, This suggests\nthat the best method of forecasting might be to examine all the\nforecasts you can find as done by others and then choose the\nmost pessimistic value.\nCertainly the data-crunching approach has been used to its\nultimate sophistication in several past studies, (13) (21)(22)\n(261.\nSince there does not seem to be anything particularly\nexceptional resulting from these analyses, one must question\nthe value of these relatively expensive methods. The difficulty\nmust be with the data base-- probably both its inadequacy for\ndocumenting what has happened in the past and its inability to\naccount for future shifts in the social and economic factors\nthat exert major controls over the use of air transportation\n(i.e,, those factors which caused the major inflections ncted\nin the preceding figures)\n\n.\n\nF.\n\nRecommendations\n\nOne of the threads that can be picked up from a careful study of the field is that sound judgment is probably as\nimportant an asset as any other tool or technique in making a\nrealistic forecast. Similarly, in attempting to make any\nrecommendations for the future in a field which currently enjoys\nsuch a dcplorable state of affairs, judgment must necessarily\nthe\'predominant factor. Thus what is offered below is the\nresult of our judgment based on Gur past experience in work\nrelated to many aspects of user acceptance of trassportatic\nsystems and our rather detailed review of the literature regarding air cargo. Unfortunately, this judgment indicates\nthat there is no easy way out of the present dilemma. The\nprocess of determining how to produce better forecasts will\nmdoubtedly be slow. It will require the introduction of\nsome new concepts and approaches as well as a marked improvement in items of fundamental importance to any techniques such\nas good data bases. Listed below are a few thoughts which\nseem to merit further consideration by those concern d with\natte.npting to improve forecasting accuracy in the air cargo\ne\n\nVARIATIONS I N\nK!lOXEUDOUfW\nFE T\nO WS\n\nFigure 3 .\n\nHistory of Mc Donrrell Douglas Forecasts\n\n-53-\n\nOF TM VARIATIONS I;{\nFORkCASTS M AT @E TE\nI\n\nu ( k i\n\n49-\n\nI\n\n1\n\n4003511-\n\nI\n\n300-\n\n1\n\nzso-\n\ndi^\n\n1792\n\ny\xe2\x80\x99\n\n20010\n5-\n\n100-\n\nPERCENT THAT HfGH\nFCREUST EXCEEDS\nLOW\n\nfl\n\n15%\n\n1960\n\n~ C L S : ATA, k l m ,\n\n65\n\n75\n\n1970\n\nCAB, COUGUS, FAA, CE,\n\nLocMED, ~ W ~ M ~ C A M\nR\n\nFigure 4 , Comparison of Air\nTransportation Forecasting\n\n-54-\n\n1N\n9J\n\n85\n\n1\n.\n\nMore emphasis should be placed on behav\'oral modeling.\nAs pointed out earlier in this report, the decision as\nto how to move cargo is made by human beings, taking\nmany things into consideration. It is not at all clear\nthat these decisions are controlled by ross economic,\ndemographic and geographical indicators+ ile such\nWi\nfactors do undoubtedly influence the magnitudes of total\ngoods movements, they may be a poor second to the service\nconcepts of the overall systems when the final choice is\nmade as to what goes where by which node. The recent\nsuccesses of such concepts as Federal Express and the\nEmery "Air Force" illustrate the importance of operational\nparameters such as convenience, dependability, special\nhandling, coordinated movements, small community service,\netc.\n\n2.\n\nThere should be a trend toward a more disaggregate\nslpproach to cargo forecasting. Such is indeed implied\nin a behavioral anaiysis. It does not appear that an\naccurate forecast may ever be possible on the basis of\ngross quantities such as tons of cargo, or revenue tonmiles, etc. The disaggregation will probably have to be\ndone both on the basis of product or commodity, and\ngeography, i.e. market segmentation. Research has been\nunderway along these lines for some time now in the passenger demand area. An example is the construction of\nmodels such as the gravity type which can be calibrated\non a zone-to-zone basis. It sliould be possible to extend such a zone concept to include product class or\ntype as one of the zonal descriptors.\n\n3.\n\nThe previous two statements, when taken together, imply\nthat improved market analysis is a primary requirement\nfor better forecasting. A product-by-product examinatioh\nneeds to be undertaken to identi y the transport properties most important to each class of products. With this\nunderstanding, the required properties which an air transportation system must exhibit in order to be competitive\nin each market can be determined. This type of approach\nwas illustrated by the work of Roberts ( 5 6 ) in examining\nthe potential of lighter-than-air vehicles as cargo movers,\nand was also implied in Sletmo\'s studies ( 2 2 ) .\n\n4.\n\nMore attention shmld be paid to the role of modal split\nanalysis in cargo forecasting. This fact is, of course,\nimplied in # 3 above. In pursuing such studies, it is\nimportant to be able to allow for t l introduction of new\nie\nconcepts evolving in any of the modes, and the effect that\nthey might have on the parameters which control the mode\nselection process.\n\n-55-\n\n5.\n\n0r.e possibility, which i done only in the nost primitive\ns\nmanner at the present time, is to introduce probability\nestimates irto the forecasting art. The best that is\noffered at present i to describr a series of scenarios- t\n.\nand then to provide an estimate f L L each of the scenarios.\nThis is extremely crude. Certainly the state-of-the-art\nof probability analysis is such that the large amount of\npast data which exist could provide information for the\nconstruction of probability relationships between the independent and dependent variables. We have been very\nsuccessful in doing this for another type of behavioral\ndecisim issue in transportation, viz., using a given set\nof variables which describe the motion of a vehicle to\npredict che probability of the passengers being satisfied\nwith the performance of the vehicle to the point where\nthey wil! use it (61),an analogy with predicting the probability af a shipper selecting a particular transportation service, given the properties of the service seems\nreasonable.\n\n6.\n\nMore effort needs to be done to select the proper quantities to be used as the independent variables in any forecasting mo6els. As indicated earlier, the key issue in\nforecastins is to predict what the future values of these\nvariables will be. It would seem that thereare ample data\navailable now to examine the accuracy of past performances\nfor predicting what would happen to factors used as independent variables. Perhaps a good bit of this does exist\nin the literature of the general business community.\nHowever, the scope of our effort did not allow us to\npursue this.\n\n7.\n\nFinally, it is recommended that a continuing effort be\nmaintained to examine the validity of all past predictions\nof air cargo forecasting. T h e reviews of Appendix A contain mention of several articles (the latest based on data\nof about 1970) which have done this for air passengers.\nHowever, there is no evidence of any serious studies in the\nair cargo field even though a variety of air cargo forecasts have been made ever since the early 60\'s. To maintain an analysis of the success and failures c \' f air cargo\nforecasts would be a relatively simple thing ; do once the\n3\ninitial backlog is overcome. Furthermore, it should provide insight into the process that could well lead to major\nimprovements. At the least, it will provide estimates of\nthe reliability of the various forecast figures as they\nappear from time to time.\n\n-56-\n\nG.\n\nReferences\n\n*\n\n1 Cetron, Marvin J. , Technological .Forecasting---A\'Practical\n.\nA\n\nroach, Technology Forecasting Institute, Gordon and\nNew York, 1969.\n\n2.

In a few cases the article was\nnot directly obtainable and the review is based on a digest of\na previous review by other authors.\nThe reviews are presented alphabetically by author, either\npersonal or corporate as the case may be. A coding system is\nused for the convenience of the reader. The code consists of\n\n-\n\nC1\na\n\n4 letters\nrepresenting the first four letters\nin the author\'& name\n\n(b)\n\n2 numbers-indicating the year of publication\n\nAIRT-66\nAir Transport Association\n" A i r Transport Facts and Figures"\nWashington, D.C.? 1966\nThese sources, issued annually, for many types of data\nrelative to the a i r transportation industry also include traffic\nforecasts for future years. The 1966 year is referenced here\nfor comparison to several other forecasts prepared about this\ntime. The ATA approach is the most simple-minded kind of extrapolation. They simply presented projections of current levels\nbased on three different possible growth rates: A "low" rate\nof 10.8% per year: and a "high" rate of 16.2% per year: resulting\nin an "averate" growth rate of 13.5% per year. In retrospect\napplying something between the average and high values would give\nthe best comparison against actual fact than any of several other\nmore sophisticated projections done durin,? the same time frame.\n\n\'\n\nPresumably the three rates were determined by an "experienced\njudgment" of what the future held in store for the air tran.sportation industry.\nARIZ-67\nArizona State University\n(National Program for Training Skilled Aviation Personnel)\nA Technical Assistance Project Sponsored by the Economic\nDevelopment Administration of the Dept. of Commerce, 1967\nThe study concluded that the key to employment in the\naviation industry was the number of aircraft to be required and\nthe extent to which they would be operated. Thus they became\ninterested in demand forecasts in the air transportation industry\nand reviewed the work that had been done to date in this area.\nThey focused their attention on several major forecasting studies*,\nadjusted them for comparability, and then formulated a composite\n\nprojection based on a judgmental review of the results,\nPt fs impossible to give any results since at this writing\nthe original report has not been located. The above comments\nwere made from the sirnary report of Kiernan (KIER-70).\nATA\n\nv\n\nBoeing Company\nDouglas Aircraft\nFAR\n\nLockheed Aircraft\nGeneral Electric\nNorth American\n\nCAB\n\nBoeing Company\n"boeing Traffic Forecasts"\nCommercial Airplane Division, Report 6-637, 30 January 1967\nThis summary is taken\' from KIER-70 since it has not been\npossible to obtain a copy of this document thus far.\nThe forecast was divided into U.S. domestic and international\nto arrive at the total civil air carrier traffic. T o projections\nw\nwere made f o r each of these segments on the basis of different\nforecast growth rates. A "probable" forecast used growth rates\nthat start at approximately 15% in 1966 to 1967 and drop to\nabout 6% in the late 1970\'s. A "possiblet\' forecast was based\nupon growth rates that vary from approximately 17% in 1966 to\na little over 8% by 1980. To get the total Free World traffic,\nBoeing added non-U.S. forecasts to these totals. These were\nbased upon growth rates that vary from about 14% to 6 % b r the\n"probable" level and 18% to 8 8 for the "possible" level.\nBoeing checked the consistency of their forecasts with other\neconomic indicators. Specifically, the economic growth rates of\nthe U . S . and those countries represented in the non-G.E. forecasts\nwere evaluated to determine their ability to support the projected\ntraffic growth. A further check on consistency was made by\nevaluating the compatibility of the air carrier forecasts with\nprojections for the transportation sector of the overall economy.\nAlthough demand elasticities were not used directly in the forecasts, an underlying assumption of moderate fare decreases and\ncontinued use of promotional fares was used. They felt that this\nwould be necessary to support even the "possible" level of growth.\nThe potential market population was checked against the\npassengors represented in the forecasts and the results were\ndetermined to be consistent with a continued increase in the\npropensity to travel.\nA- 2\n\nBOEI-73\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplane Company\nCargo Analysis and Development Unit\n"U,S.-Europe Econometric Forecasts o f Trade and Air Freigh,\nto 1980"\nJune 1973\nNote:\n\nEurope consists of 15 Western European nations.\n\nI: regression-type econometric model is used, with the model\nin the exponential form:\n\nb\ny\'\n\n= axi i\n,\n\nb\nj\n\nj\n\n.\n\nThree dependent variables are used:\n\n(1) total trade in dollars:\n(2) air freight tonnage eastbound; 2nd\n( 3 ) air freight tonnaqe westbound.\nFour causative (or independent) variables were studied:\n\n-\n\n( ) Gross Kational Prodrct = GNP;\n1\n(2) per capita income:\n( 3 ) time: and\nyield in cents per ton mile f F.\n(4:\nIn 6eve:oping the actual modei, the following actions or\nassumptions were made:\n\ntransform equation (1) to a l o g form;\nall dollar values are to be constant 1969 values;\nthe independent variables are expressed as indices\nwith the 1962 data assigned the value of 100.\n\nHence, if\n1962 GNP = 679.2 billions\n1963 GNP = 706.4 billions\nthen\n1962+ 100\n1963 = 706.4/679.2 = 1.04 x 100 = 104.\nThe regression studies yielded the following three models:\nTotal Trade : (TT)\nlog (TT) = -1.494 + l.7425 log (composite US + Europe G N P )\nR2 = .98\n\nEastbound A i r F r e i g h t Tons\nl o g (EAFT)= -2.9843\n\n+\n\n5\n\n(EAFT)\n\n3,466 l o g (EGNP)\n\nk \xe2\x80\x99 = ,96\nWestbound A i r r \xe2\x80\x99 r e i g h t T m s : (F?AFT)\n\n-\n\nl o g (WAFT) = , 6 5 5\n\n+\n\n2.73 log (USGNP)\n\n-\n\n- 1,4309\n\nI C J\n\n?\n\n2 . 0 5 loa\n\nR2 = .99\nThe EAFT model h a s t h e h i g h e s t s t a n d a r d error (.068) and t h e\nTT model the l o w e s t (,0111; WAFT h a s s t a n d a r d error o f .034.\nThus t h e p r o c e d u r e f o r f o r e c a s t i n g t h e f u t u r e performance of\nthei.7deperdent v a r i a b l e s becomes t h a t of f o r e c a s t i n g t h e f u t r r e\nvalues of t h e dependent v a r i a b l e s :\n\n-\n\nUSGNP\nBased on t h e s t u d y of t h e reports of a v a r i e t y o f\ne c o n o m m r e c a s t i n g groups s c a t t c i c d t h r o u g h o u t t h e c o u : t r y .\nResults are as follows:\n\nYear\n\n(actual)\n\nGNP *\n\n-\n\n1962\n1972\n1973\n1974\n1975\n1976\n1977\n\n679.2\n1,012.3\n1,073.4\n1,112.9\nlr157.4\n1,206.0\n1,251.8\n\n% Change\n-\n\ni n GNP\n\n-\n\n6.0\n3.7\n4.0\n4.2\n4.0\n\nIndex (1962 = 1 0 0 )\n1no\n\n149\n158\n3 64\n170\n178\n184\n\n___-_----L----------__________C_________~~---------\n\n1980\n\nIr435.0\n\n4.6 ( a v g ) / y r\n\n211\n\n* i n b i l l i o n s o f c o n s t a n t 1969 dollars.\n\n-\n\nEGNP\nThe GNP\xe2\x80\x99s of 1 5 European n a t i o n s ( a l l Western Europe)\nare u a t o form t h i s v a r i a b l e .

Although of a type which might be classified as\na cross-sectional modal split demand mode1 with time dependence\nincorporated as needed, it is not the usual "gravitftype.\nIt was developed in such a way a s to make a conscious attempt\nto avoid the inconsistencies and characteristics of unreasonable\nbehavior that is exhibited by many of the currently used models.\nMany of these problems were analyzed and summarized in an earlier\nMitre report by Nutter (NUTT-72).\nThe model derived is quite complex when used to all of its\npower, and at the time of the report no calibration had yet been\nattempted.

However,\nthe reader interested in forecasting from the point of view of\ntransportation must be careful in interpretation since many of\nthe techniques discussed are apslicable to the marketing of\nphysical products and goods, but not to services. For example,\nthe marketer of goods has types of information available which\nare extremely useful to him for forecasting, but which do not even\nexist in the transportation field, e.g., inventory control, order\nbacklogs, customer reordering cycles, replacement sales, warranty\nreturns, etc.\nNevertheless, this is a very useful document. It is easily\nreadable and indeed should be read subject to the above cautions\nby everyone not thoroughly familiar with forecasting methodology.\nOne of the major features of the article is the presentation in\ntabular fc m of a summary of the principal features of a large\nnumber of techniques.

It talks in terns of long-range\nand short-range (3 months) forecasts.\n\nAll material to be moved is for a strict military market,\nand there are essentially two inputs into the forecasting process:\n(1) the requirements as stated by the overseas base conrmander\nbased on his plans, budgets anti orders; and (2) data on the past\nhistory of activity vs. plans for each base.\nThe report recommends an operations analysis computer-type\nactivity at a central Logistics Control Agency which will process\nthese inputs in conjunction with a Kalman-type smoothing algorithm\nto provide updated forecasts to the MAC and MSC planners as to\nwhat the most likely demands for O-D service might be during the\nshort\nand long-range periods. A manual review and override\nfunction is provided to accommodate or adjust for large-scale\nevents due to unusual circumstances.\n\n-\n\nThe work may be best described as strategic logistics planning. Although the data analysis techniques could perhaps be\nused to advantage in performing the same function for commercial\nair cargo data, the input forecasts from the "market" areas\nwould cause a problem in the commercial arena. The article\ncertainly contributes nothing in this area which is the key\ncommercial problem. In the military version, these forecasts\nare based on operational plans and commitments, and are not\nsubject to the control of the normal demographic, economic and\nsociological forces wkich govern forecasting in civilian markets.\nDEOS-77\nDeosaran, Gerald, Henry Sweezy and Regina Van Duzee\n"Forecast of Commuter Airlines Activity"\nFAA, Report FAA-AVP-77-28, July 1977\n(authors a h b are with SARC; author c with FAA)\nThe approach of ur.ing straightforward regression techniques\non a variety of the usual population and economic explanatory\nvariables with past years\' traffic statistics was rejected.\nThis was because the six-year period (1970-75) for which commuter\nairline statistics are available represents a period of unusual\ngrovth. Thus the basic assumption of time-series modeling, viz.,\nthat the interrelationships between variables will remain stable\nthrough the periods of model formulation and application, does\nnot seem to be valid.\nA-10\n\nAs an alternative it was decided to seek models which would\nrelate commuter traffic to both economic or demographic variables\nand the operational factors which are likely to affect it. This\nled to grouping the potential markets into the following basic\ncategories :\n\n1 Hubs (CAB/FAA classifications wcra used);\n.\n2 Non-hubs (over 1000 emplanements in 1975);\n.\n3 . Special areas (water, mountains, resmts, etc.);\n4.\nSmall points (under 1000 emplanenents).\nA.\n\nTotal EmDlaneinents\n\nThe first step was to forecast the total commuter emplanements\nanticipated in the target forecast year. This was done by tyir,g\nthe forecast directly to that made for emplanements of certificated\ncarriers thzt year. The rationale for this decision was that a\nstudy of the historical development of the comml;ter industry showed\nthat the large majority of commuter passeng2rs connected with\ncertificated carriers. A l s o since the industry seemd to be\nreaching maturity, the present data on the relative emplanements\nof the two types (viz., 25.5/1000) would continue to hold. Thus\nthe actual data is based on the FAA Aviation forecasts for certificated carriers (FAA-76). The result is a forecast of 10 million\n.\nconaputer dmplanercents from certificated points. P separate estimate using a different approach was made for the traffic to be\ngenerated from points not now served (see section entitled\n"Potential Commuter Points"). This added 2 . 2 million-- the actual\nCotal figure being 12,183,600 emplanements.\n\nB.\n\nAllocation to Groups\n\nMethods were next devised to allocate these emplanements to\nthe various basic groups, and then to service areas within the\ngroups. Each of the groups must be examined separately.\n1\n.\n\nHubs\n-\n\nThe hub category was allocated its share of emplanements\nusing total personal income as the indicator (total personal\nincome is representative of popu1a:ion and per capita income which\nhistorically "seem to be the most significant explanatory factors\nin developing a demand forecast for air travel"); the share was\nweighted for the ratio of its percentage share of traffic to incord\nfor the base ye-r. This gives the following relationship:\n\nwhere EJ/N = ratio of emplanements of group to the national figure\n\nA-11\n\nI\n= ratio of total personal income of group to the\ng/N\nnational zigure\nB = base year\n\nF = forecast year\nFrom this expression the forecasted emplanements for the\ngroup could be written as:\nE\' = ENF\nF\nF * (Eg/EN\nI,]\ngl\n\nThe data used to obtain values for I were obtained from the\nDept. o f Commerce BEA area data and projections.\nOnce the total allocation for the hubs as a group was obtained,\ntt was distributed among the individual hubs using the same weighted formula, simply replacing g by the local hub, and N by g.\nOn this basis the forecasts call for 58.1% of the commuter\ntraffic (emplanements) to occur at 84 hub airports.\n2.\n\nNon-hubs (over 1000 emplanements in 1975)\n\nA vide variety af straightforward regressions did not work,\nand so an approach focusing on service characteristics was used.\n\nThe overall group was divided into four sub-groups based\nupon the character of their operations:\nSub-1.\nSub-2.\nSub-3.\nSub-4.\n\nInstitutional:\nAgricultural and Distributive;\nIndustrial and Mining;\nRecreational\n\nA further stratification was effected by dividing each of these\nsub-groups into two classes: (a) those having joint service with\na certified carrier; and (b) those having only commuter service.\n\nEach sub-group was allocated its share of the total projected\ncommuter market using the same proportional basis as for the hubs.\nThen each point (P) in a given sub-group was allocated its\nshare in a similar fashion, but with a major change in the variable.\nInstead of using total income, an index called the Economic/Isolation Unit was used (see below). Thus the allocation f o r s d a f o r\neach point bemme:\n\nA-12\n\nwhere\n\nU = Econcmic/Isolation Units\n\nu\n\n= total personal income x driving time to alternate.\n\nAs before the total personal income comes from Dept. of\nCommerce BEA statistics. The driving time to alternate points\nmust be estimated in each case.\nAfter these projections at each point were computed, it was\npossible to analyze them as a function of U for the various subgroups given above and develop the following regression equations:\nService by Commuters Exclusively\n\n+\n\nInstitutional\n\nEl = - 7 . 4 2 5\n\nAgricultural\n\nEl = -3.615 + 0 . 0 8 1 ~ i .

Their validations of their forecasts invoLved the\nsame economic factors as those used by Boeing (BOEI-67). In\naddition they looked at the U.S. Intercity commom carrier traffic.\nThey compared their forecast for the air share of intercity travel\nwith projections of total common carrier domestic intercity travel\nto check for consistency. They also looked at personal income\nand corporate profits as key factors in the support of continued\ngrow+? of air travel.\nELL1 -70\n\nEllis, Rayrnond H. and Paul R. Rassam\n"National Intercity Travel: Development and Implementation of\na Demand Forecasting Framework"\nPeat, Marwick and Livingston, Washington, D.C., Report T8-542,\nMod. 1, Final Report, PB 192 455, March 1970\n\nThis is a very intense assimilation and computerized analysis\nof large amounts of data done under extreme time pressure (the\nentire job was accomplished in one month). Quite obviously\n(even to the authors of the report) this time pressure detracted\nfrom the a3ility to consider the results as definitive. The\nreason for the time pressure is not clear.\nAll modes were considered, but several strategic decisions\nand constraints were applied. First of all this was for passenger transportation only, The idea was to estimate the demand\nbetween any of a series of zones covering the U . S . At the request\nof DOT, the zonal pattern was one previously established for them\nby the Service Bureau Corporation and which divided the U.S. into\n490 zones. It W ~ Sdecided that rail was only a serious competitor\nbetween those zones which involved major population corridors\n(N.E,,\nCalifornia, etc.) and so the corridor areas were done\nsepzrately from the other zones. Next, it was found that intercity bus data were so sparse that it was impossible to treat bus\nin any analytical way, dnd so tile b u s contribution was forecast\nseparately at the end of the study. Hence, the major portions of\nthe study were concerned w i t h hicjhway and air.\nA-14\n\nThe first task was to prepare current trip tables between\nthe zones using whatever data were available and making projections when necessary. For example, the Bureau o f Public Roads\nhad prepared auto trip tables for 3,076 zones for 1962; this had\nbeen compressed to the 490 zone structure by Service Bureau Corp.\nand it was then extended to the 1967 base year using population\nprojections and a Fratar Model technique: finally it was adjusted\njudgmentally to reflect changes in propelnsity to travel based on\npersonal income, life style, etc. Air travel was based upon the\n1967 CAB Domestic Origin-Destination Survey of Airline Passenger\nTraffic. This information provided airport-to-airport statistics\nthat could be arranged according to the 490 zones. However, it\nwas felt necessary to redistribute these trips to the true origin\nand destination points of the travelers which are often not in the\nsame zone as the airport used.. This was accomplished using a\ngravity model witt the "production" terms being the airport-toairport trip tables, and the "friction" terms based lipoxr time and\ndistance factors obtained from a number of airport access studies.\nIt is interesting to note that about 29% of the trips had final\norigin-destinations in zones different from those in which the\nairports were located. Combining the air and auto data produced\ntotal person-trip tables for all interchanges between the 490\nzones.\n\n-\n\nThe next step is to calculate trip impedances based upon those\nfactors which tend to effect travel. For autc, these were based\non distance in the highway network, casts of operating autos and\novernight times and costs where applicable. Air network impedances\nwere estimated on the basis of distance, time, cost and frequency,\nincluding access and egress times and costs.\nIn the projection phase of the work the air-autc? portion involved a two-step process. The first was tc project the total\ntrip tables. This was done by upgrading the 1967 trip tables\nusing the Fratar Model technique and future population forecasts.\nThe results were again adjusted for the additional growth\n(potentially positive or negative) due to projected changes in\nincome and travel propensity. Total zonal trip tables were prepared for 1975, 1980 and 1950.\nThese trips then had to be distributed between the air and\nauto modes. Initially it had been hoped to accomplish this\nthrough the use of a gravity-type model similar to the McLynn\nmodel developed for the Northeast Corridor project. However, this\ndid not work, probably due to collinearity between the time and\ncost variables used in the friction terms. Instead, an approach\ninvolving a diversion curve between air axl auto based on a\ndecision made on the basis of comparinq cost and time was developed.\nThn resulting equation was similar to that which results from the\ndiscriminant analysis method.\n\nA-15\n\nBus projectiaris were made on the basis of a proportional\nextrapolation of what meager data were available. The projections probably had poor accuracy, but represented an insigr-ificant port.ion c;f the total.\nFinally the projections for high-density corridor travei were\nobtained by adapting the results of travel studies made earl3.er\nby a variety g f investigators for about 20 diffzrent corridors.\nELLf-71\nEllison, A.P.\n\xe2\x80\x9cForecasting Passenger Air Demand\xe2\x80\x9d\nFlight International, July 3 , 1971, p. 58\nEllison is a lecturer in Economics at Queen Mary College at\nthe University of London.\nThe article appears to be a popularized version of another\narticle entitled \xe2\x80\x9cAir Transport Demand Elasticities for U .

This analysis concerns\nthe question of whether or not airlines can anticipate changes\nin passenger traffic by manipulating schedules either through\nchanges in the short-olr the long-run factors.\n\nThe mathematical models =sed to isolate the scheduling factor\nfrom other passenger traffic determinants were composed of the\nability-to-pay factor, scheduling penalties, and a distance\nfzctor.

A three-way classification\nanalysis of variance is then used to breakdown total demand for\nair travel along the lines of the effects of the decisions to be\nmade. The variables proposed are time effect, city effect,\nairline effect, and the cross interactions time/city, time/\nairline, and city/airlind. The time, city, airline, and city/\nairline variables were found to be significant at the 99% level.\nTotal variation in demand explained was 8 8 . 3 % . Regression analysis\nwas then used. to explain the significant variables.\nFrom the results of the regression analysis, the authors\nconclude :\n(1) Time effects are well explained by air travel price,\nproxied I- yield per passenger-mile, and a trend\nvariable, proxied essentially by increased income.\n( 2 ) City effects are explained well by population and income.\n\nDistance between cities was found to show little effect\non demand.

Two of the\nsignificant variables, airline effect and city/airline effect,\nbasically reflect the high levels of service expected in large,\nhighly competitive metropolitan markets. The use of this model\nin analyzing demand in small communities with limited service is\nconsidered inappropriate.\nSUSS-69\n\nSussex House\n"Executive Aviation Report, No. 1807\'\'\nWimbledon, England, March 18, 1969\nThis report reviews the same eight passenger demand forecastIt emphasizes the wide variaing models as Kiernan ( K I E R - 7 0 ) .\ntion in the various methodologies used and the enormous variation\nin results which they produce, and concludes that there is little\nor no meaning or significance that can be attached to forecasting.\nThe wide discrepancy in results is demonstrated by the attached\ntables and figure.

ADPE values were obtained\nfrom the U . S . DOT study Air Service to Small Communities, and\nthe m\ndependent variable 6ata c\na\n0 Census o Eopulation.\nThe SPSS stepwise variable inciusion multiple regression\nprocedure was used. Eleven linear equations were attempted using\ncombinations of the independent variables and stratifications of\nthe data based on level of passenger emplanements and community\npopulations. There were no really satisfactory models obtained\nas all showed one or more of the Characteristics of r3or correlation, poor t value or unreasonable or illogical values of\ncoefficients.\nNext, a nonlinear regression procedure was attem2ted. Six\ndifferent stepwise analyses were condxted resulting in 26\ndifferent nonlinear regression models. Multiple correlations\nbetween the independent variables w r e found to be abundant, with\nthe result that only about f o u r of these nonlinear models were\nuseful. The b e s t one (which was also better than any of the\nlinear models) was:\nADPE = 2.81694 t 0.09372\n\n(ISOLATE) (POPL)\n\nR2 = .401 and t = 6.01,\n\nThe implications of this model bear a str4king resemblance to\na gravity model.

Jr.\n"lrlodels of the Demand for Air Transportation"\nThe Bell Journal of Economics and blanagerncnt Science, Vol. 3 ,\nNo. 2, Autumn 1 9 7 2\nThis paper presents an analysis of three different empirical\napproaches to the analysis oC air transportation demand.\nThe first mode3 discussed is the standard cross-sectional\ngravity type model which has the f o r i of a production function,\nThe variables used in this particul. model inclde: 1) price;\n2 ) product of aggregate income, 3 ) telephone calls between the\ncity pairs; 4 ) distance; and 5) elapsed flying time. Parameters\nfor the model were estimated for 500 city pairs classified on the\nbasis of distance: 0-500 miles, 500-1000 miles, 1000-1500 miles,\n1500-2000 miles, and over 2 0 0 0 miles. R2 values for the six\nclasses ranged from .64 to . 8 3 with the highest value associated\nwith flights reater than 2000 miles. Short haul, 0-500 miles,\nThe estimated values of the coefficient\nobtained an R of 0.72.\nlikewise experienced large variations acrass the models. From\nthis analysis the author concludes that cross-sectional techniques\nare unsuited f o r demand analysis of the entire mdrket. HCwever,\nhe asserts that the gravity type model can Froduce satisfactory\nresults for homogeneous sets of city pairs.\n&\n-\n\ni\n!\n\nThe second model disc;lssed is the aggregate travel model\nwhich treats air travel, as measured in revenue passenger miles,\nas a homogeneous commodity. In this model aggregate demand is\npostulated to be a functicn of same measure of price, a measure\nof average national income and, sometimes, some measure of alternative travel forms. The variables most often used are: 1) per\ncapita disposable income and 2) avcracje revenue per passenger\nmile. The author asserts that the use of average revenue as a\nproxy\n- price prevents the model from b e i n g a true demand\nmodel. The author concludes from t h e an;l.lysj.s of this model that\naggregate equations can predict demand accurat~ly\nonly L f demands\nbstween city pairs remain relatively uniform.\nThe third modei considered is the city pair model of demand\nfor\'air transportation. The purpose of the model is to indicate\nwhether differences in demand exisc across city pairs in order to\ndetermine if cross-sectional OK aqgregate models are theoretically\nfeasible. The model is basically a modification of the gravity\nmodel with the variables b e i n g 1) price, 2 ) di.rtancc, and 3 ) mass\nvariables. The mass variables selected are functions of the po;?ulation and income distributions of the city p a i r s . Results of the\nspecification of the model indicated that \'-ht- specj-a1constriiction\nof the mass variable is sic~ni\nficant. Thc najor cc<nclusi.cn t h e\nof\ncity pair analysis is that larqa dj.ffe-?ncesin air travel demand\nexist between cities because of reqional f luctuntions.

Young\'s apprcach is also designed\nfor such a purpose. The major intent of this articie is to\nformulate an appropriate abstract mode model for forecasting intercity travel in the Northeast Corridor of the United States.\n\nThe general plan of this paper is as follows: an examination\nof the theoretical fomdations of the abstract mode model where\nsuch a model is discussed in terms of the theory of consumer\nbehavior; a formulation of the statistical demand function where\nseveral alternative versions will be proposed; consideration of\nthe appropriate estimation procedures and the forecasting\nformulas; and finally a presentation of the empirical results\nof various formulations of the abstract mode models which have\nbe selected for examination including a summary of the major findings and conclusions.\nWhile Young\'s primary concern is the application of the\nabstract mode approach to the study of travel demand, he is quick\nto point out that a similar approach can be Edopted for much\nwider applications. \'ine advantage of the abstract mode approach\nis of particular importance when the major objective is to forecast future travel tolumes f o r some transportation facility which\nmay be drastically different from the present and past ones. The\nmajor argument of this approach is that tho demand f o r travel,\nlike the demand for any cther commodity, is a function of various\nattributes of the commodity in question. T h e s e attributes include\nvarious modal characteristics. such as money cost, journey time\nm d departure frequency, etc. Therefore, as Young points out,\nthe demand for travel by air, by b u s , or by any other transport\nmode is actually determined by the same demand function. Young\nspends twenty pages doodling with an empirical interpretation of\na nonlinear model to drive this point home.\nYOUN-72\nYoung, Kan Hua\n"A Synthesis of Time-Series and Cross-Section Analyses: Demand\nf o r Air TranqJortation"\nJournal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 67, Sept.\n1972\nThis paper is primarily a comparison of time series and\ncross-sectional analyses with a proposed methodology f o r pooling\nA- 4 8\n\nboth types of data. The author uses the results of the analysis\nto test various hypotheses concerning macro- and microeconomic\nparameters.\n\nThe author has applied the study to an empirical analysis\nof the demand for a i r transportation. It should be nated, however, that the author is not so much concerned with air transportation as he is with economic analysis. The results of the\nanalysis appear to be excellent. In most cases the coefficients\nwhich have been estimated are statistically highly significant.\nThe general case time series model postulates variables: 1)\nticket price, 2 ) journey time, and 3) per capita income. The\ncoefficients of the model are postulated to be indicative of\nshort-run and long-run price and income effects. The explanatory power o f the model was high with R2 = ,9937. The general\ncaje cross-sectional model postulates variables: 1) per capita\ndisposable income of an income group, 2) reference income of the\nother income groups (as measured by a weighted average), and 3)\nreference demand (the avzrage demand of the immediately higher\nand lower income groups). The explanatory power of the model was\nhigh with R2 = - 9 3 4 6 .\nThe author asserts that the general pooled model, which incorporates both time series and cross sectional iata, has the\nbest results of a l l . As might be expected, the complexity of this\nmodel is considerably increased over the other general case models.\nThe author had used time series data from the CAB ana\nCommerce Department from 1337-1966, and cross-sectional data\n(saqe sources) for 1955, 1957, 19S9, 1960, 1963, and 1964 in\ncomputing the parameters of the model. The time series model\ntreats the entire nation as a consumption unit while the crosssectional model treats groups of individuals, e.g., income\nclasses, as consumption units. Sinci no data tables are included\nin the paper, it is not immediately app3rent how either of the\nmodels should be used.\nFinally, the paper is intended to predict demand f o r air\ntransportation from a total demand point of view. The models\nappear to be inappropriate for use in predicting on an intercity\nbasis.\nYU-70\n\nYu, Jason C.\n"Demand Model for Intercity Multimode T r a v e l "\nTransportation Engrg. Journal ( A S C E ) , May 1970, pp. 203-218\nThis article suggests some modification to the abstract mode\nmodels which are tested on data collected from p a i r s of cities in\nWest Virginia.\'\n\nThe results of the study are:\n1.\n\nThe usual exogenous motivations for business travel\n\ndL f fer from those which influence personal travel. Although\nt: ere exist some variables commonly attracting both business\n\ni r d personal travelers, the degree of influence relies, to a\nr,\nreeat extent, on the reasons for travel. Accordingly, in order\n-0 more effectively estimate travel dencpd, it is desirable to\nmalyze business and personal travel separately.\n2\n.\nIn deriving the best predictions of travel demand,\nthe mathematical forms of the variables entering the model\nmist be both logical and meaningful. On the other hand, since\n8tta availability often plays an inportant role in limiting\ntie number of variables that may be modeled, it becomes even\nm x e important to make the best possible use of the available\nvariables in terms of their logical forms.\n3\n.\n\nA travel demand model derived by a time series analy-\n\ns\xe2\x80\x9ds offers superior ability for forecasting purposes, especially\nfur study, dramatic changes of demand eiasticities of relevant\nvariables over two years indicate that the cross-section model\nderived from one single time period will not be appropriate to\npredict the travel demand during another period of time.\n\n4.\nThe frequently used transportation variables, travel\ntime, travel cost, and service frequency, are obviously not the\nall-inclusive determinants which influence the travelers\xe2\x80\x99 modal\nchoices. In this respect, the dummy variable technique is considered derlrable in order to characterize the effect of other\npc?tentia1 Jariables on modal-split. \xe2\x80\x9d\n\nORIGINAL BAGE 15\nOF POOR Q U\nUa\nA-50\n\nAPPENnIX B\nBIBLIOGRAPHY ON AIR CARGO FORECASTING\nThis I ? not intended to be an exhaustive bibliography,\nbut rather a record of the documsnts and references encountered\nduring this study.\n\nAdditional references on forecasting, demand\n\nmodeling, and modal split analysis are contained in Appendices\nC and D\n.\n\nAppendix E contains those citations which are either\n\nexclusively concerned with air cargo (or air freight) or have\na considerable portion of their effort so directed.\n\nThe Bibliography contains 53 entries, arranged in alphabetical order by author, personal when known, otherwise corporate.\n\nB a w l , W.

The emphasis is on fundamentals\nalthough many of the articles are concerned with specific system\nstudies as a means for checkinq the hypotheses or concepts under\nstudy. A conscious effort has been made to avoid the work in\nurban transportation, although this is the most active area.\nNeverthel.ess, some articles in this area are included because\nof their fundamental importance.\nWork which emphasizes applications in air cargo are not\nincluded here, but appear in Appendix R. Similarly, those\narticles which pertain chiefly to air passenger transportation\nare in Appendix C.\nThe bibliography is divided into four sections. Secticn 1\n(51 entries) contains those articles which stress achieving the\nability to przdict demand. Section 2 (55 entries) is comprised\nof citations that particularly address the issues of modal choice\nmalysis. In Section 3 , ( 7 3 entries), the principal concern is\nwith techniaues for model development. Finally, Sect{-on 4 contains a few key references (1s) to technological forecasting\nwhich we have found to be particularly useful.\nIn each section the entries are alFhabctica1 by author,\npersonal when known, other corporate.\n\nS e c t i o n D-1,\n\nDtrnand f o r T r a n s p o r t a t i o n\n\nBaumol, W i l l i a m J. and Margaret E.\n\n,C\n\n" P r e d i c t i o n of t h e Demand f o r Transpc\nASME, 1967, Paper 67-TRAN-27\n\nqgel\n\na t i o n Services"\n\nEeam, Louis Hyman\n"The A r t of F o r e c a s t i n g "\nRandom House, 1970\nPeckman, Martin J.\n"Some A s p e c t s of t h e Demand for I n t e r c i t y Travel"\n2nd I n t e r n a t i o n a l Symposium on t h e Theory o f Traffic Flow,\nLondon, 1963\nEergsman, Joel\n"Comments on Quandt and Baumol\'s Demand Model f o r Abstract\nT r a n s p o r t Modes"\nJournal of Regional S c i e n c e , Vol. 1, N o . 1, Summer 1967\n\nPox, G.
