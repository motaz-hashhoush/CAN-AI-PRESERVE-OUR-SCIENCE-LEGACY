Protecting select areas of\nthe space plane during its fiery dive is Advanced Flexible\nReusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI).\nAFRSI was developed by Ames Research Center\nthen integrated into the Space Shuttle by Rockwe11\nInternational. Production of the AFRSI was transferred\nin 1974 to Hi-Temp Insulation Inc. of Camarilla,\nCalifornia.\nFor over 22 years, Hi-Temp has provided insulation\nblankets for the external leeward surfices of the Space\nShuttle. Hi-Temp created many new technologies to\nmeet the requirements of the Space Shuttle program. A\ncombination of low weight and high thermal efficiency\ndemanded an examination of new materials and\n\nfabrication techniques. Material must resist temperatures\nof some 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes with\nno burn through.\nOn low-temperature areas of a Space Shuttle, the\ncompany made molded fiberglass insulation covered\nwith polyester film. Hydraulic lines and system components are wrapped with this insulation.\nA Shuttle orbiter's payload bay is protected from\nheat by using Hi-Temp's two-blanket insulation system.\nLastly, the Space Shuttle's main engine nozzles feature\nceramic insulation. This insulation is constructed to\nwithstand temperatures to 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit and\nextreme vibration.\nImprovements to the insulation material by HiTemp with the assistance of NASA gives it the ability to\nwithstand heating and cooling cycles; rapid and fluctuat-\n\nInsulation technology based on protecting the Space Shurtle during reenhy has been adopted by the airera# industry\nand other commercial intmsa.

These include: insulation blanket to cover aircraft parts, such as engine\nexhaust ducts; fire barrier material to protect aircraft\nengine cowlings; molded fiberglass insulation blankets\nfor acoustical protection; and in aircraft rescue fire\nfighter suits.\nHi-Temp's Space Shuttle work has nurtured a\nunique proficiency, with many new production techniques now available that can be geared to both aerospace and commercial markets.\nWorking closely with material manufacturers, HiTemp has fabricated blankets using carbon, graphite,\nceramic, and nicalon. To protect and seal sewn insulation blankets, Hi-Temp uses a wide variety of facing\nmaterials including coated fabrics, mylars, and films. In\naddition, using stainless steel thread, foils up to .002\nthick can be sewn to insulation blankets for liquid proof\nprotection at high operating temperatures. This skill has\nbeen applied to such critical programs as the Trident\nmissile, Delta launch vehicle, as well as the Space\nShuttle.\n\nEquipment to fulfd tasks at Hi-Temp include many\nspecial machines such as rigidizing rollers for strengthening metal foils; a special heated platen press for bonding\nstructural components; heat-sealing machines; and\nwelders for stainless steel and inconel.\nA Fire Protection Division of Hi-Temp Insulation\nhas been established, offering the first suit designed\nexclusively by and for aircraft rescue fire fighters.\nOffering great mobility, comfort and flexibility, the fire\nfighting suit uses proprietary insulating materials that\nenable the suit to weigh far less than other heatprotecting apparel. From the inside out, the Hi-Temp\nfire fighting suit retards heat, scalding steam, flammable\nfumes, and molten liquids.\nHi-Temp is a supplier to the Los Angeles City Fire\nDepartment as well as other major U.S. civil and\nmilitary fire departments.\nAt its start in the mid-1970s, Hi-Temp relied\nheavily on government projects, becoming 90 percent\ngovernment dependent. It is now estimated that this\ngrowing concern has become 85 percent commercial\ndependent, with about 15 percent of its work done\nunder government contract.\n\nHi-Temp's i m h t i o n is used on the Boeing\n77% is assembled on a checkfixrure and\nIt\nincludes a quilted imuhtion core.\n\nCommercial BenefitsApinoffs\n\n"
