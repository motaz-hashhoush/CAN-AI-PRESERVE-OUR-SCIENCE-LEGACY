A source\nof balanced alternating electrical energy for energizing\nthe circuit is coupled between the commonly connected plates of the first pair of capacitors and the\ncommonly connected plates of the second pair of capacitors. Due to the operation of the diode bridge, the\nsum of the resultant charges developed on the first\npair of capacitors is proportional to the .relationship\nbetween the respective capacitors of the second pair,\nand consequently, an output voltage taken across the\nfirst pair of capacitors will be proportional to that relationship.\n11 Claims, 14 Drawing Figures\n\n12\n\n20 1\n\n8/1972\n\nPATENTED MAR 4i975\n\n^.869,676\nSHEET 1 OF 3\n\n^\n\nED\n\n30\nN3\n\n\'\n\nFig-J.\n\n\xc2\xa3C4\n\n-\n\nR->\nWV\n\n34\n\n-^EOUT\n\nOUT\n\n-U"C\n\n32\n\nR-\n\nS>\xe2\x80\x94^o"1\xe2\x80\x94 \'\n\n30\n\nR\nE\n\nOUT\n\n/0\n^\xe2\x80\x94f :\n32 -"\n\n^_ DI"^ , I\n\nA/VV\xe2\x80\x94r\xe2\x80\x94o\nC\n\nOUT\n\nL\n\n3-, 4; 4;> ^\xc2\xab"D4\n\nFig..\n\npTJW^\n\nIN\n\nl^C\n\n^,\n\nINVENTORS\nJOHN DIMEFF\n\nro26\nBY\n\nDEAN R.

A first output\nterminal 30 is coupled to bridge terminal 12 and a second output terminal 32 is coupled to bridge terminal\n16.\nThe\'output signal Eoll, developed across terminals 30\nand 32 will be proportional to the difference in the capacitance of capacitors C3 and C4. This can be understood by referring to FIG. 2 of the drawings, which\nshows the excitation waveform E ltt and a positive DC\noutput signal E w - which are present at output terminals\n30 (at output terminal 32 a similar waveform and DC\noutput are developed except that the DC voltage is negative).
