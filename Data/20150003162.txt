The photodiode includes a substrate providing a\nbuffer layer having a metal contact on its bottom portion\nserving as a common cathode for receiving a bias voltage, and\nsuccessive layers deposited on its top portion, the first layer\nbeing drift layer, the second being an absorption layer, the\nthird being a cap layer divided into four quarter pie shaped\nsections spaced apart, with metal contacts being deposited on\noutermost top portions of each section to provide output\nterminals, the top portions being active regions for detecting\nlight. Four transimpedance amplifiers have input terminals\nelectrically connected to individual output terminals of each\np-i-n photodiode.\n\nUSPC ................................... 257/448, 458, E31.062\nSee application file for complete search history.\n\nReferences Cited\n\n(56)\n\nU.S. PATENT DOCUMENTS\n3,714,491 A\n4,366,377 A\n4,403,397 A\n4,857,982 A\n4,906,583 A\n5,053,837 A\n5,214,276 A\n5,332,919 A\n5,714,773 A\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n1/1973\n12/1982\n9/1983\n8/1989\n3/1990\n10/1991\n5/1993\n7/1994\n2/1998\n\nMcIntyre et al . ............. 257/458\nNotthoff et al ................ 257/446\nBottka et al ..................... 438/66\nForrest .......................... 257/186\nKagawa et al . ................. 438/91\nTonai ............................ 257/458\nHimotoetal . ............. 250/214.1\nFujimura ...................... 257/434\nBurrows et al .................. 257/82\n\n37 Claims, 9 Drawing Sheets\n\n60\n\non\n\n1\n\n!1\nL B:\n1\n\nB\n\np+MLIAL\n\nCONTACT\n\n28\n\nUS 8,598,673 B2\nPage 2\n(56)\n\nReferences Cited\n\nOTHER PUBLICATIONS\nV.

The government has\ncertain rights in the invention.\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention relates to semiconductor devices,\nand more particularly, to both photoreceivers, and to p-i-n\nphotodiodes.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nQuad photoreceivers typically include a 2x2 array of p-i-n\nphotodiodes with each photodiode followed by a transimpedance amplifier (TIA). Such quad photoreceivers are used in\nmany applications, such as long baseline interferometry, freespace optical communication, missile guidance, and biomedical imaging and spectroscopy, which rely on free-space\noptical propagation with position and/or direction sensing\ncapability. It is desirable to increase the active area of quad\nphotoreceivers (and photodiodes) to enhance the link gain,\nand therefore sensitivity, of the system. However, the resulting increase in the photodiode capacitance reduces the bandwidth of the photoreceiver and adds to the equivalent input\ncurrent noise, especially at high frequencies, for a given voltage noise level of the TIA.\nIn fact, the capacitance of the photodiode and its excess\ncurrent noise arising therefrom, scales linearly as the device\narea, thereby negating the corresponding increase in the link\ngain. Owing to this contradiction, the front-end quad photoreceiver can limit the sensitivity of the overall system. An\nexample of such an application is the Laser Interferometry\nSpace Antenna (LISA), which proposes to detect gravity\nwaves in space by measuring distance with \xe2\x80\x9410 \xc2\xb5m/ -VHz\naccuracy over a baseline of five million kilometers. The\npresent invention, as described herein relative to quad photoreceivers, is applicable for use in LISA which requires use of\nlow-noise large-area photoreceivers, based on low-capacitance large-area photodiodes, for free space applications.\nIn LISA, the optical local oscillator (LO) power incident on\neach photoreceiver quadrant will be restricted to 100 \xc2\xb5W to\nminimize the power requirements and thermal fluctuations\nfor high pathlength stability. Assuming a photodiode responsivity of 0.7 A/W at 1064-nm wavelength, the desired shot\nnoise-limited system operation requires the photoreceiver to\ndisplay an equivalent input current noise density of <4.7\npA/-VHz per quadrant. For 0.9-A/W photodiode responsivity\nat 1550-nm wavelength, an equivalent input current noise\ndensity of <5.4 pA/-VHz is needed. Currently, LISA\'s sensitivity is restricted by the noise arising from 20- to 25-pF\ncapacitance per quadrant demonstrated by typical 1-mm-diameter InGaAs quad photodiodes.\nAccordingly, there is a need for photoreceivers having\nassociated low capacitance photodiodes to achieve enhanced\nsensitivity. There is also a need for low capacitance photodiodes for many other applications that can be provided individually or in an array. The present inventors urge that such\napplications include systems relying on coherent optical\ndetection, such as LISA, as well as those utilizing direct\ndetection.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nA quad photoreceiver for a first embodiment of the invention includes four p-i-n photodiodes formed on a common n\'\n5 doped InP (100) substrate serving as a buffer layer with a\nbottom metal layer contact providing a common cathode for\nreceiving a bias voltage, a first i-InP drift layer is deposited on\nthe buffer layer, followed by an i-InGaAs absorption layer,\nfollowed by an InP cap layer divided into four spaced apart\n10\np\'-doped sections, with the p\' doping extending into a top\nmost underlying portion of the absorption layer.

In one embodiment of the present\ninvention, there is provided a 1-mm-diameter InGaAs quad\nphotodiode having 2.5-pF capacitance per quadrant. In conjunction with low-noise field effect transistor (FET)-input\noperational amplifiers, the associated low-capacitance quad\nphotodiodes are each designed to provide a quad photoreceiver having an equivalent input current noise density of less\nthan 3.2 pA/-VHz per quadrant up to a 3-dB bandwidth of -20\nMHz. This constitutes up to -17-dB improvement in sensitivity over a quad photodiode having 20-pF capacitance per\nquadrant.\nReferring to FIG. 1, a schematic block diagram of a quad\nphotoreceiver 10 is shown for one embodiment of the present\ninvention. The quad photoreceiver 10 includes four quadrants\nor sections 12, 14, 16, and 18 each having a photodiode 50\nfollowed by a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) 48, and an\noutput terminal (Vout) 52 for supplying an output signal from\neach quadrant 12, 14, 16 or 18, and a common input terminal\n42 for providing a common cathode to supply a bias voltage\nto each of the photodiodes 50. Each of the transimpedance\namplifiers 48 includes individual input terminals electrically\nconnected to the output terminals of each photodiode 50,\nrespectively, via a conductor 51. In one embodiment of the\npresent invention, the photodiodes 50 of the quadrants 12, 14,\n16, or 18 are fabricated from a quad InGaAs photodiode array\n60 (see FIGS. 3A-313) as will be described hereinafter. It is\nnoted that the photoreceiver 10 of the present invention is\nshown having four quadrants for purposes of description and\nis not limited to such a number. Thus, the present invention is\nintended to encompass embodiments of at least one quadrant\nor a plurality of quadrants.\nFIG.1 is also extended to show an array of photodiodes 50\nup to a limit of (value ofn2, 3, 4.... ), coupled individually\nto associated transimpedance amplifiers 48 up to a limit of m\n(value of m=2, 3, 4, ... ), respectively. In this manner an array\nof photoreceivers 10 can be provided. Also, a single photodiode 50 can be provided a bias voltage, and used to drive a\nsingle TIA 48 for providing a photoreceiver (n=1, m=1).\nReferring to FIG. 2, an equivalent circuit of a single quadrant 12, 14, 16, or 18 of the quad photoreceiver 10 of FIG. 1\nis shown with key design parameters useful for calculating\nequivalent current not se in accordance with the present invention. Each quadrant 12, 14, 16, or 18 includes a p-i-n photodiode 50 electrically coupled at its output terminal to the input\nterminal of an associated transimpedance amplifier (TIA) 48.\n\nEach photodiode 50 further includes an input terminal 42 for\nproviding a common cathode to receive a bias voltage, a diode\n44 connected in parallel to a capacitor C D, and a resistor R D\nhaving one end connected to the common connection of the\n5 anode of diode 44 and capacitor C D\nThe TIA 48 includes a 51-k-Q) feedback resistance RPB\nand -0.2 pF of feedback capacitance CPB in conjunction with\nan FET-Input operational amplifier (OpAmp) 47. An output\nend resistor R D is connected to the inverting input of ampli10\nfier 46. A suitable example of the OpAmp 47 is an ADA4817\nFET-input operational amplifier commercially available from\nAnalog Devices, Inc. of Norwood, Mass. The nominal\nOpAmp 47 parameters, relevant for noise calculations,\n15 include input voltage noise density V, =4 nV/-VHz, input\ncurrent noise density I,,A 2.5 fA/ -VHz, and input capacitance\nCA S 1.4 pF. The photodiode 50 of the quadrant 12, 14,16 or\n18 is characterized by its capacitance C D and series resistance R D 1 OQ). The quad photoreceiver 10 was assembled\n20 in a standard TO-3 package for device testing.\nReferring to FIGS. 3A and 313, a quad photodiode array 60\nincluding a quad InGaAs photodiode structure is shown for\none embodiment of the present invention. The quad photodiode array 60 is based on the top-illuminated dual-depletion\n25 region (DDR) design. The quad photodiode array 60 includes\nfour p-i-n photodiodes 50 formed on a common n\' InP (100)\nsubstrate 39 with a buffer layer 38 of thickness H deposited\nthereon. A metal layer contact 40 is deposited on the bottom\nof the substrate 39 to provide a common cathode for receiving\n3o a bias voltage, a first i-InP drift layer 36 of thickness E\ndeposited on the buffer layer 38, followed by an i-InGaAs\nabsorption layer 34 of thickness D, followed by an InP cap\nlayer 28 of thickness C divided into four p\'-doped quarter pie\nsections or quadrants 12, 14, 16, and 18, each with an active\n35 region 64 having p\' doping extending into a top most underlying portion 35 of the absorption layer 34, each serving as a\nphotodiode 50. The combination of the absorption layer 34\nand the drift layer 36 forms a total depletion region of thickness F. Note that the buffer layer 38 can be provided as part of\n40 orintegral with substrate 39, thereby saving a deposition step.\nThe quadrants 12, 14, 16, and 18 are characterized by a\ndiametric size A where each quadrant 12, 14, 16, or 18 is\nspaced from one another by length B.

Other examples of suitable anti-reflection\ncoating include, for example, silicon dioxide.\nEach cap section or quadrant 12, 14, 16, and 18 has a p\'\nmetal contact 20, 22, 24, and 26, respectively, deposited on\n50 top outermost portions thereof to serve as respective output\nterminals. The top portions of each quadrant 12,14,16, or 18\nprovide active regions 64 responsive to light signals. Each of\nthe p-doped active areas 64 of the quadrants 12,14,16, and 18\ntogether with metal contacts 20, 22, 24, and 26, the absorption\n55 layer 34, the drift layer 36, the buffer layer 38, and metal back\ncontact 40, operates as a single p-i-n junction photodiode 50\nshown in FIG. 2. Four transimpedance amplifiers 48 (not\nshown) include individual input terminals electrically connected to the output terminals in the form of the metal con60 tacts 20, 22, 24, and 26, of each cap section or quadrant 12, 14,\n16, or 18, respectively.\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the cap layer\n28 is composed of indium phosphide (InP). The absorption\nlayer 34 is composed of intrinsic (i) In 0 53Gao 47As. The drift\n65 layer 36 is composed of intrinsic indium phosphide (i InP).\nThe buffer layer 38 is composed of n\' doped indium phosphide. The quad active area 64 of the cap layer 28 and the\n.\n\n,\nA\n\n(-\n\nUS 8,598,673 B2\n5\n\n6\n\nupper portion 35 of the absorption layer 34 is p + doped to a\ndesired acceptor concentration through Zn diffusion.\nThe dual-depletion region (DDR) structure provided by the\nabsorption layer 34 and drift layer 36 of a quad prototype\nphotodiode array 60, in this example, provides high-speed 5\n(i.e., low capacitance operation in a top-illuminated geometry by balancing the transit times of electrons and holes with\nthe aid of the InP drift layer 36. The epitaxial growth was\ncarried out in a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition\n(MOCVD) reactor on an n + doped InP substrate 38. Standard io\nplanar processes were used to define diameter A as a 1-mmdiameter quad active area 64 with 20-M separation B\nbetween the adjacent quadrants 12, 14 16, and 18. Note that\nthe present invention is not meant to be limited to an array of\nquad photodiodes but is meant to cover single large area low 15\ncapacitance photodiodes, and arrays of two or more such\nphotodiodes in accordance with the present invention.\nThe DDR structure shown in FIG. 3B contains a 2-\xc2\xb5mthick (thickness D) Ino.53Gao 47 As absorption layer 34, of\nwhich the top 0.5 \xc2\xb5m (depth G) forming the quad active area 20\n64 was p+ doped to an acceptor concentration of about 1 x 10 18\nCM-3 through Zn diffusion. Combined with an 8-\xc2\xb5m-thick\n(thickness E) intrinsic InP drift region 36, a total depletion\nwidth of 9.5 \xc2\xb5m (width F) can be achieved at highreverse bias.\nThe buffer layer 38 thickness H is typically 0.5 \xc2\xb5m and can be 25\notherwise varied in thickness. The n+ metal back contact 40\nthickness I, and the p + metal contacts 20, 22 24, 26 thickness\n7 is typically 0.2 \xc2\xb5m. The anti reflection coating is optimized\nfor the light wavelength of interest, and if silicon nitride, a\nthickness of about 130 mu permits efficient passage of a 30\nwavelength of 1064 mu, for example. Each side of DDR\nstructure 62 has a length L sufficient to accommodate the\ndiameter A of the quad active area 64, in this example.\nThe dimensions given are preferred. However within practical limits the dimensions for large area photodiodes of the 35\npresent invention can range for A from about 0.1 mm to 10\nmm, B from about 5 to 50 \xc2\xb5m, C from about 0.1 to 1.0 \xc2\xb5m, D\nfrom about 1 to 3 \xc2\xb5m, E from about 1 to 10 \xc2\xb5m, and G from\nabout 0.1 to 0.5 \xc2\xb5m. Note that the cross sectional view of the\nquad photodiode of FIG. 313, in this example, was fabricated 40\nusing a standard planar process As would be known to one of\nskill in the art, other processing can be utilized such as mesa\nprocessing to define the photodiode 60.\nThe dark current and the capacitance of each quadrant 12,\n14, 16 18 of the quad photodiode 50 were measured using a 45\nprecision source meter (Keithley 2400) and a capacitancevoltage (CV) meter (HP 4284A), respectively. Each quadrant\n12, 14, 16, 18 of the packaged quad photodiode array 10 was\ncharacterized as follows. The center of the quadrant 12, 14,\n16, 18 was illuminated with a single tone modulated 1550- 50\nmu wavelength optical signal and its conversion gain was\nrecorded using a 50-Q radio frequency RF) spectrum analyzer (Agilent E4440A). To prevent the OpAmp 46 from\noverloading an additional 50-Q series resistor was used\nbetween the photoreceiver quadrant output and the RE spec- 55\ntrum analyzer The same spectrum analyzer was used to mea-\n\n)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n-\n\n.\n\n,\n\n-\n\n-\n\nabsorbing material. However, the low bandgap material in the\nconventional photodiode structure increases the dark current\nof the conventional photodiode by enhancing the band-toband tunneling and generation recombination current. Consequently such a design is not optimal for low noise applications. In the DDR photodiode structure 62, shown in FIG.\n313, the thickness of the intrinsic In 0 53 Gao 47As absorption\nlayer 34 is dictated by the quantum efficiency requirements\nand is restricted to 1.5 \xc2\xb5m thickness D minus thickness G).\nThe majority of the intrinsic region forming the total depletion region F is comprised of the 8 \xc2\xb5m-thick high bandgap\nInP (Eg=1.35 eV) drift layer 36, thereby minimizing the\nphotodiode\'s dark current, in this example.\nIt is also necessary to maintain a low unintentional background doping level to ensure that this intrinsic or depletion\nregion F is depleted at a reasonable photodiode bias. Referring to FIG. 4A, the plot demonstrates that a depletion width\nF of 9.2 \xc2\xb5m can be achieved at 5-V reverse bias for an n-type\nbackground doping concentration of 1x1014 CM-3. Such a\ndepletion width F will result in 2.4-pF capacitance per quadrant (C D) in a 1-mm diameter quad photodiode. Achieving\nthe same depletion width F at elevated levels of background\ndoping will require higher reverse bias voltage Also, with\nfurther reference to FIG. 4A, curve 100 shows capacitance for\none quadrant of photodiode 60 for background doping of\n5x10 14 CM 3 ; curve 102 depletion width for one quadrant of\nphotodiode 60 for background doping of 5x1014 CM-3; curve\n104 shows capacitance for one quadrant of photodiode 60 for\nbackground doping of 2x10 14 CM 3 ; curve 106 shows depletion width for one quadrant of photodiode 60 for background\ndoping of 2x10 14 CM 3 ; curve 108 shows capacitance for one\nquadrant of photodiode 60 for background doping of 1 x10 14\nCM\n3 ; and curve 110 shows depletion width for one quadrant\nof photodiode 60 for background doping of 1 x1014 CM 3 .\nReferring to FIG. 413, the quad photodiode reported here\nhad (CD2.5 pF at 5-V reverse bias, therefore implying an\nn-type background doping of \xe2\x80\x941 x1014 CM 3 in the intrinsic\nregion. Referring to FIG. 4C, each photodiode quadrant demonstrated a dark current, IDARK 140 nA at 5 V reverse bias.\nSuch dark current leads to a shot noise density of 0.2 pA/ -VHz,\nwhich is negligible as compared to other noise sources discussed below.\nThe equivalent input current noise density I, ,FQ of the quad\nphotodiode 50 in each quadrant 12, 14 16, 18 as shown in\nFIG. 2, arises from a combination of the voltage noise and\ncurrent noise of the OpAmp 47, thermal noise from the series\nresistance of the photodiode 50, thermal noise from the feedback resistance Rf,B, and shot noise due to the dark current of\nthe photodiode 50. These noise sources are statistically independent and combine in quadrature and represented by Equation (I) as follows:\n-\n\n,\n\n-\n\n(\n\n-\n\n.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n,\n\n,\n\n(\n\n,\n\n.\n\nsure the output voltage noise density of the photoreceiver\nquadrant. The equivalent input current noise density for each\nphotoreceiver quadrant 12,14,16,18 was computed from the\ncorresponding output noise and conversion gain measure- 60\nments. These measurements were performed at room temperature without any active cooling.\nFor a given active area the capacitance of a p-i-n photodiode 50 can be reduced by increasing the width F of its\ndepletion region see FIG. 313). In a conventional InGaAs\n65\nInP photodiode structure the entire depletion region is usually comprised of low bandgap Ino.53Gao 47As (Eg-0.74 eV)\n,\n\n(\n\n,\n\nVNA~ 1\n2 \\\n\n+4n2f 2 (Cy ~ +CAMy )2 I+INA +\n\n~I~\n\nRFa\nINEQU)\n\n=\n\n[4gf (C yr + CAMr)\n\n2 4kB T\n\nkBTRrD ] + F-e + 2 DARK\nR\n\nwhere T is the absolute temperature, kB is the Boltzman\'s\nconstant, and q is the charge of an electron (see FIG. 1C for\nother definitions). FIG. 5A displays these noise components\nand the resulting Ir FQ for CD2. 5 pF. The values of the other\nparameters used in these calculations have been given above.\nThe equivalent noise for C D-20 pF is also given in FIG. 5B\nfor comparison.
