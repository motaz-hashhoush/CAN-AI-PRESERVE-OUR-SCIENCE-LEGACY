A large number of hydrostatic shells was computed for the usual exponential heating law with constant damping length. The boundary conditions were that on both sides of a shell the conductive flux at chromospheric temperatures is small. The boundary value problem was solved with a shooting technique. The main goal of the calculations was to determine the dependence of the shells on coronal heating flux (F sub Mo) and damping length (L); and in particular, to localize the boundary line in the parameter space (F sub Mo, L) that separates normal extended coronae from coronal shells.", "title": "Overheated Open Coronal Regions", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T13:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850009463, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hammer, R."}, "organization": {"name": "Heidelberg Univ.", "location": "Heidelberg, Germany"}}, "id": "b9ffcf2f4c234d02840149e88a079ca2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-09-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19850009463, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850009463, "id": "3dc61a5319c74ce2ab9572be5ec4b9f8", "publicationName": "NASA.
