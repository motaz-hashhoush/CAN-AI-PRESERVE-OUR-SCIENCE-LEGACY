Thus,\nthe Hall probe remains stationary as the magnet and\nshaft rotate together. With a constant control current\nsupplied to contacts at the ends of the probe, the output voltage (Hall voltage) generated between contacts\non the sides of the probe will be directly proportional\nto the sine of the angular displacement or rotation\nof the meter shaft.\nSince the sine of the angle and its measure in radians\nrapidly approach equality for small angles, the voltage\noutput and meter shaft rotation for angles ranging\nfrom .0 to about 6\xc2\xb0 may be accepted as being directly\nproportional. A voltmeter connected to the Hall transducer output could then be calibrated to give direct\nreadings of meter shaft rotation (corresponding to\ndifferential pressure or other physical magnitude proportional to meter shaft rotation) on a linear scale\nextending over about \xc2\xb1 6\xc2\xb0.\n\nNotes:\nA transducer based on an application of the Hall\nEffect has been designed to produce output voltages\ndirectly proportional to small rotary shaft displacements, such as in mechanical differential-pressure\nmeters. A primary advantage of this electrical output\ntransducer for measuring angular displacements is\nthat it does not introduce frictional contact between\nstationary and moving parts. As in the case of other\n\n1. The principle of this transducer would be generally\napplicable to any meter with a rotary shaft that\nresponds to changes in a physical magnitude.\n2. With appropriate shaping of the magnetic field\nbetween the magnetic poles, or the use of a specially\ndesigned Hall probe, the voltage output linearity\nof the transducer can be extended to a much larger\nrange of shaft rotations (approximately \xc2\xb1 30\xc2\xb0).\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
