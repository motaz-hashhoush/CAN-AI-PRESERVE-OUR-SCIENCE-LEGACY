[yourSky is an upgraded version\nof the software reported in \xe2\x80\x9cSoftware for\nGenerating Mosaics of Astronomical Images\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-21121), NASA Tech Briefs,\nVol. 25, No. 4 (April 2001), page 16a.] A\nrequester no longer has to engage in\nthe tedious process of determining what\nsubset of images is needed, nor even to\nknow how the images are indexed in\nimage archives. Instead, in response to a\nrequester\xe2\x80\x99s specification of the size and\nlocation of the sky area, (and optionally\nof the desired set and type of data, resolution, coordinate system, projection,\nand image format), yourSky automatically retrieves the component image\n\n18\n\ndata from archives totaling tens of terabytes stored on computer tape and\ndisk drives at multiple sites and assembles the component images into a mosaic image by use of a high-performance\nparallel code. yourSky runs on the\nserver computer where the mosaics are\nassembled. Because yourSky includes a\nWeb-interface component, no special\nclient software is needed: ordinary Webbrowser software is sufficient.\nThis program was written by Joseph Jacob\nof Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The FHSRS can also be adapted to\nperform similar functions for other organizations. The FHSRS affords a combination of capabilities, including those\nformerly provided by three separate pro-\n\ngrams in purchasing, inventorying, and\ninspecting hardware. The FHSRS provides a Web-based interface with a server\ncomputer that supports a relational\ndatabase of inventory; electronic routing\nof requests and approvals; and electronic documentation from initial request through implementation of quality criteria, acquisition, receipt,\ninspection, storage, and final issue of\nflight materials and components. The\ndatabase lists both hardware acquired\nfor current projects and residual hardware from previous projects. The increased visibility of residual flight components provided by the FHSRS has\ndramatically improved the re-utilization\nof materials in lieu of new procurements, resulting in a cost savings of over\n$1.7 million. The FHSRS includes subprograms for manipulating the data in\nthe database, informing of the status of a\nrequest or an item of hardware, and\nsearching the database on any physical\nor other technical characteristic of a\ncomponent or material. The software\nstructure forces normalization of the\ndata to facilitate inquiries and searches\nfor which users have entered mixed or\ninconsistent values.\nThis program was designed and written by\nJohn Salisbury, Scott Savage, and Shirman\nThomas of Cortez III for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.
