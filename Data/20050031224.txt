b'A NATURAL WAY TO STAY SWEET\nORIGINATING TECHNOLOGY/\n\nPARTNERSHIP\n\nNASA CONTRIBUTION\n\nThe experiment was one of the earliest projects for\nBiospherics Inc., the company Levin founded in 1967.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s planetary science program provided research and\ndevelopment support to the company, selecting Levin\xe2\x80\x99s\nexperiment for its Viking missions in 1969. After the\nViking 1 lander touched down on Mars to gather data, it\nwould place Martian soil into a container with the radiation-laced nutrients. If microbes were present, they would\neat the nutrients and release radioactive carbon dioxide,\nwhich is detectable by a Geiger counter.\n\nCONS UME R/ HOM E/RECREATION\n\nA revolutionary, low-calorie sugar is now available to the\nfood and beverage market, offering an all-natural alternative to table sugar and artificial sweeteners. Tagatose, a\nsugar that appears in nature in small quantities, began\nits unusual journey to the commercial market nearly 30\nyears ago, when Dr. Gilbert V. Levin invented a life detection experiment to place aboard NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Mars Viking\n1 and Viking 2 landers. The experiment involved using\nradiation-laced nutrients to determine the presence of\nmicrobial life in Martian soil samples.\n\nIn selecting the nutrients for the experiment, Levin first\nexamined the conventional form of glucose, because every\nliving organism on Earth eats this type of sugar. Levin\nthen considered the principle that some complex molecules exist in \xe2\x80\x9cright-handed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cleft-handed\xe2\x80\x9d forms,\nknown as enantiomers. In sugars, these forms are referred\nto as D and L, from the Latin dexter and laevus, and they\nonly differ in the arrangement of their elements. While\ntwo enantiomers of a sugar molecule will respond identically in a chemical reaction, they will not have the same\nreaction in biological systems. Earth\xe2\x80\x99s microbes only eat\nand metabolize D-glucose. Since digestion could differ\nfor the possible Martian microbes, Levin prepared both\nD-glucose and L-glucose for his experiment\xe2\x80\x99s nutrients, so\nthat any possible life on the Red Planet was not missed.\nWhen technical problems prevented the use of glucose,\nhe substituted another sugar, lactose, using both its D\nand L forms.\nThe results of Levin\xe2\x80\x99s experiment came back positive for\nthe radioactive carbon dioxide. While the parameters of\nthe experiment suggested life had been discovered on Mars,\ntwo other life detection experiments came up negative. A\ntest for organic material, the precursor to all life, also was\n\nTagatose, an all-natural alternative to table sugar and artificial sweeteners, has been introduced into 7-Eleven\xe2\x80\x99s Diet\nPepsi Slurpee.\xc2\xae\n\n47\nnegative, leading NASA\xe2\x80\x99s scientists to conclude that Levin\xe2\x80\x99s\ntest had been fooled by oxidants in the soil.\nPRODUCT OUTCOME\nWhile the Viking experiment was not generally accepted\nas proof of life on Mars, Levin\xe2\x80\x99s exploration of the two different forms of sugar led him to realize that if the human\nstomach does not digest L-glucose, the sugar might be\nable to serve as a low-calorie sweetener. The main question was whether or not a left-handed sugar would taste\nas sweet as the right-handed sugar people consume. Levin\nestablished a taste panel at his Beltsville, Maryland-based\ncompany, which he renamed Spherix Incorporated. No\none was able to tell the difference between the L and\nD versions of the sugar. He then patented the use of Lsugars as low-calorie sweeteners.\nWhile L-glucose was an excellent candidate to be a\nlow-calorie sweetener, Levin found that his company could not make it cheaply enough for commercial use. He continued to explore and patent other\nleft-handed sugars for use in foods, such as L-fructose and\nL-gulose, but Spherix continued to find them too expensive\nto be viable. Levin then examined D-tagatose, which\nclosely resembles L-fructose. The right-handed tagatose is similar enough to a left-handed sugar to cause\nthe human stomach to digest only a small percentage of\nit, making it low in calories. More importantly, Spherix\ndeveloped an inexpensive method to make tagatose, and\npatented the method in 1988.\nTagatose quickly proved its advantages as an alternative for\nregular sugar. Since it is 92 percent as sweet at table sugar,\nit can be used as a one-to-one sugar replacement. This gives\ntagatose the benefit of having the same bulk as table sugar,\nmaking it possible to be used in recipes for baked goods\nor any other recipe in which the bulk of the sugar is an\nimportant ingredient. Other low-calorie sweeteners on the\nmarket have high-intensity sweetness, and cannot be used\nfor many recipes, since a tiny pinch achieves the necessary\n\n48\ndeemed tagatose as \xe2\x80\x9cGenerally Recognized As Safe,\xe2\x80\x9d a\nstatus which is required for sales in the United States. This\nFDA action enabled Arla Foods to move forward with\ncommercialization, as the company began building plants\nto manufacture the sugar.\n\nCONSUMER/HOM E/RECREATIO N\n\nIn 2003, Arla Foods began successfully selling tagatose to\nfood and beverage manufacturers under the brand name\nGaio-Tagatose.\xc2\xae The sugar was introduced into 7-Eleven\xe2\x80\x99s\nDiet Pepsi Slurpee,\xc2\xae and diet fruit juices to be sold at WalMart and other chains. Several other prominent food product companies are manufacturing their products with it\nand considering marketing them. These products include\nchocolate candy, soft and hard confectioneries, cereals, ice\ncream, frostings, and chewing gum. Tagatose may also be\napplied to health bars and dietary supplements, creating\nopportunities in the health food markets. Because the\nsugar has no impact on blood sugar levels, it is suitable\nfor inclusion in low-carbohydrate diets. An early study\ncommissioned by Arla Foods indicated tagatose\xe2\x80\x99s potential market in foods as valued at over $1 billion per year,\ndepending on its suitability for a wide variety of products.\nThe additional potential uses in diet sodas and health food\ncould expand the market significantly.\n\nThe natural sugar taste of Naturlose\xe2\x84\xa2 makes it an excellent\nsweetener to improve the taste of non-food products such as\ntoothpastes, throat lozenges, and cough syrup.\n\nlevel of sweetness. Tagatose also browns like regular sugar\nduring baking, and does not have an aftertaste like some of\nthe high-intensity sweeteners. In addition to being low in\ncalories, tagatose does not cause cavities or promote tooth\ndecay. It also provides a safe sweetener for diabetics.\nSpherix continued to develop tagatose until 1996, when\nthe company exclusively licensed the use of the sweetener\nin food and beverages to Arla Foods Ingredients. Five years\nlater, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\n\nWhile Arla Foods explores the food and beverage market\nfor tagatose, Spherix has launched a sales and marketing\ncampaign for Naturlose,\xe2\x84\xa2 the company\xe2\x80\x99s brand name\nfor non-food versions of the sugar. Spherix received its\nfirst shipment of Naturlose from Arla Foods in December\n2003, enabling the company to pursue commercial sales\nfor toothpastes, mouthwashes, and cosmetics. Naturlose\xe2\x80\x99s\nnatural sugar taste and low calories make it an excellent\nsweetener to improve the taste of these products and others\nsuch as throat lozenges and cough syrup.\nLevin recently relinquished his chief executive office position to become Spherix\xe2\x80\x99s executive officer for science. He\nis leading the effort to prove Naturlose\xe2\x80\x99s medicinal value\nto drug manufacturers. The company\xe2\x80\x99s animal studies\nhave indicated the sugar\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enhance fertility and\ntreat anemia. Diabetics may particularly benefit from both\n\nthe food and non-food applications of tagatose. A study\nfunded by Spherix and the State of Maryland, conducted\nat the University of Maryland School of Medicine, showed\nthat not only is tagatose safe for diabetics, but it also blunts\nthe rise in blood sugar from regular glucose consumption.\nMore importantly, it showed that tagatose could potentially be used to treat Type 2 diabetes, as the benefits for\nthis all-natural sugar continue to get sweeter.\nGaio-Tagatose\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Arla Foods Ingredients\nSlurpee\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of 7-Eleven, Inc.\nNaturlose\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of Spherix Incorporated.\n\n'
