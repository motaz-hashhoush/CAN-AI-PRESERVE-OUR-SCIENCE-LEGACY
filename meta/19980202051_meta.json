This is a report on its current status and future plans. Also included are some comments on particular aspects of data analysis concerning dark subtraction, shading, and removal of cosmic rays. At present NICMOS provides excellent images of high scientific content. Most of the observations utilize cameras 1 and 2 which are in excellent focus. Camera 3 is not yet within the range of the focus adjustment mechanism, but its current images are still quite excellent. In this paper we will present the status of various aspects of the NICMOS instrument.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980202051, "id": "fdd31cdc01e146d0a45ad1c68cf10679", "publicationName": "The 1997 HST Calibration Workshop with a New Generation of Instruments", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19980202026, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "The 1997 HST Calibration Workshop with a New Generation of Instruments", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
