Their wide variety is of interest in view of the fact that all nine planets were probably formed at the same time and out of the same chemically homogeneous mixture of gas and dust, i.e., the primitive solar nebula. The most likely explanation for this diversity in composition seems to be that the planetary atmospheres have undergone important evolutionary changes during their history of about 4.5 billion years. The early history of the earth's atmosphere is reviewed, as well as that of Venus and Mars. The most interesting aspect of Jupiter is that its present atmosphere seems to be composed of the same gases, hydrogen, methane, and ammonia, out of which the first living organisms are believed to have been synthesized on the earth.", "title": "Planetary atmospheres.", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-06T20:27:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19720038346, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rasool, S.
