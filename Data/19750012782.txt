b'N75 20854\nGEOTHERMAL DOWN-WELL PUMPING SYSTEM\nHugh B. Matthews and Warren D. McBee\nSperry R e s e a r c h Center\nSudbury, Massachusetts\nA key technical problem in the exploitation of hot water\ngeothermal energy resources is down-well pumping to inhibit\nm i n e r a l precipitation, improve t h e r m a l efficiency, and enhance\nflow. A novel approach to this problem involves the use of a s m a l l\nfraction of the t h e r m a l energy of the well water t o boil and superheat a clean feedwater flow in a down-hole exchanger adjacent to\nthe pump. This s t e a m powers a high-speed turbine-driven pump.\nThe exhaust s t e a m i s brought t o the surface through an exhaust\npipe, condensed, and recirculated. A small fraction of the highp r e s s u r e clean feedwater i s diverted to lubricate the turbine pump\nbearings and prevent leakage of brine into the turbine-pump unit.\nA project demonstrating the feasibility of this approach by means\nof both laboratory and down-well t e s t s has just started under an\nNSF grant. The status and plan of this project a r e presented.\n\nI\n.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe S p e r r y R e s e a r c h Center has been engaged for two years in the\nanalysis and design of a novel type of pumping s y s t e m for geothermal\nliquid-dominated wells. Since July 1974 we have been under a grant from-the\nNational Science Foundation through its Research Applied t o National Needs\n(RANN) p r o g r a m to build and t e s t this system. Field testing in a geothermal\nw e l l is expected t o begin in July 1975, possibly in the Imperial Valley of\nCalifornia.\n\nII.\n\nWELL DYNAMICS\n\nFigure 1 illustrates in a simplified geologic situation what is known as a\nhydrostatic well. The w a t e r table in the s t r a t a surrounding the well is\nessentially at the surface of the ground and the water increases in t e m p e r a t u r e\nas we go deeper in the earth. With the valve closed to prevent flow, the\nwater inside the well casing w i l l a s s u m e virtually the s a m e t h e r m a l gradient\na s the water outside and, therefore, being of the same average density, w i l l\nr i s e .in the casing essentially to the level of the outside water table.\n\nIf the valve in our illustration i s opened (Fig. 2) and the w e l l caused t o\nstart flowing by some means, the hot water flowing up the casing w i l l progressively lower the average density of the water column and the flow velocity\nw i l l inc r e a se a c co r dingly\n\n.\n\n28 1\n\nWhen 2 1 2 \xc2\xb0 F water approaches the surface, a portion of it w i l l flash into\nsteam, lowering the column density even m o r e and again accelerating flow.\nThe level at which this flashing begins w i l l move down the well a s increasingly\nhot water comes to the surface and w i l l stabilize at a level a s determined by:\n\n(1)\n\nThe bottom hole temperature (temperature losses up to the flash\nlevel in a flowing well a r e negligible).\n\n(2)\n\nThe average density of the mixed liquid and vapor column above the\nflash point.\n\n(3)\n\nThe two phase flow l o s s e s from the flash level to the surface.\n\nThe mixture of s t e a m and water will a r r i v e at the surface a t a temperature of\n2 1 2 \xc2\xb0 F and (in a 4 0 0 \xc2\xb0 F well, for example) as approximately 20% saturated steam.\nThe quantity of flow f r o m the well will depend on the v e r y complex\ninterrelation between the t h e r m a l and saline gradients in the water outside the\nwell, flow losses in the s t r a t a feeding the well and i n the well casing, and the\nactual density gradient in the column above the beginning of flashing. When\nthis natural flowing \'method is used to produce a well, a s it i s in a few places\ni n the world for generating electricity, an additional impedence i s inserted in\ns e r i e s at the surface (equivalent to closing down our valve somewhat) so that a\np r e s s u r e drop i s introduced between atmosphere and the Rankine cycle\nconversion equipment. Thus, the water s t e a m mixture w i l l enter the energy\nconversion process at a higher t e m p e r a t u r e than 2 1 2 \xc2\xb0 F (in a 4 0 0 \xc2\xb0 F well, say, at\n3 2 5 " F , 97-psia p r e s s u r e , and 10% steam).\nT h e r e a r e s e v e r a l drawbacks t o such a naturally produced well: among\nthem a r e :\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nGeothermal waters a r e usually considerably contaminated with\ndissolved solids. The process of flashing causes the most\ntroublesome of these compounds to precipitate, which then coat\nt h e well casing (sometimes s e a l it) and, m o r e seriously, foul\nsurface equipment, such a s heat exchangers.\n\n(3)\n\nIII.\n\nW e l l flow i s reduced to below that of open wellhead flow by the\nadded impedence.\n\nThe lowered t e m p e r a t u r e caused by the flashing reduces the\nefficiency of the surface conversion equipment.\n\nWELL PUMPING\n\nIf a pump is introduced into the well below the flash point and sufficient\np r e s s u r e is added t o the water so that it w i l l not flash even on the surface, the\nabove problems a r e largely negated:\n(1)\n\nFlow can b e increased, even above the well\'s natural flow rate, with\na consequent increase in available energy.\n282\n\n(2)\n\nWater is brought t o the surface at o r near bottom hc!c temperature\nwith a consequent increase in surface conversion efficiency.\n\nIf the water remains ur.der pressure, t h e d i s s o h e d cxrbon dioxide\nremains in solution and prevents the most troublescme constituents\n(mainly carbonates) from precipitating. Thus, exGept for silica,\nwhich w i l l precipitate when the water is. cooled, \'the most serious\nproblems are eliminated. The effect of silica remains t o be\n.\ndeiermided, but experiments t o date are somewhat encouraging.\n...\n- ._\n..\n. .\n.\nPUMPWORK\n. ._\n:\n(3)\n\n_%V.\n\nThe following factors determine the amount o work to be Gone b y t h e\nf\npump:\n(1)\n\n.\n\nRequirements. The water must a r r i v e at the surface somewhat\nabove the saturation pressure. In a 400\xc2\xb0F well, this is\napproximately 247 psia, and with a 10% pad, 272 psia, If t h e r e\n-is a pump ti the surface circulating the hot well water, then the--.\nnet positive suction head fNPSH) requirement of this pump must\n.be added. to t h e pressure. . .. .\n.\n-\n\n.\n\n~\n\n(2)\n\nThermal Liit. A s mentioned before, the column of water inside the\nwell, when flowing. will be essentially at bottom hole temperature,\nwhile t h e w a t e r in the s t r a t a oxtside will have some thermal\ngradient f r o m the low surface temperature to the high temperature\nat well bottom. This effect, of course, reduces the amount of pump\nwork and can be of considerable m.agnitude. A 400\xc2\xb0F hydrostatic\nwell of relatively pure water, 5000 feet deep and with a linear\nt e m p e r a t u r e gradient i n the surrounding strzta, will gain\napproximately 150-psi p r e s s u r e due t o its t h e r m a l lift.\n\n(3)\n\nW d l Productivity. Bottom hole p r e s s u r e will, of course, drop as\nflow is increased because of friction in the surrounding s t r a t a , a\n\nproperty described in the oil industry by the t e r m "productivity\nindex, " The pump must make up this p r e s s u r e loss, and the\npractical m a t t e r of energy expenditure would seem tc; limit\nconsideration to wells where this p r e s s u r e loss is no m o r e than\na few hundred psia at acceptable flow rates.\n(4)\n\nCasing Flow Loss. The flaw in the casing will always be turbulent,\nand g r e s s u r e loss will be proportional to flow squared. A 1000-gpm\nflow-in a 8-5/8-in. casing-wiil generate a loss of perhaps 50 to i60\np s i in a 5000-foot-deep well, depending on pipe roughness. A\npractical casing design for such flows might be 8-518 in. up to just\nbelow the pump and 10-318 in. or 13-3/8 in, above.\n\n283\n\n-\n\nV.\n\nCONVENTIONAL PUMPING SYSTEM\n\nFigure 3 shows the\nments of a conventional pumping\nturally flowing rate, then the-pu\nwell is pumped only at th\nin the well a sufficient depth below the natural flash level to\nNPSH f o r the pump, which is the required p r e s s u r e\nof the fluid at its pzirticular temperature to prevent\nIf a g r e a t e r quantity than the natural rate-is pumped, then the\nan additional depth a s determined by the adde? fo\n! w l o s ~ e s the strata and in\nin\nthe well casing-below the pump. it apeea.rs that this depth could well be 1000\nfeet o r m o r e for optimized well production in the general cask.\n..\n\nT h e pump will be driven by energy sent down from the srirface in some\nsort of conduit, an electric cable or a hydraulic tube, fer example, This\nenergy will, i n fact o r in effect, be obtained f r o m the well water itself and\nbefore ending downhoie as p r e s s u r e added t o the well flow be transformed a\nnumber of times, with each transformation resulting in a loss of efficiency.\nF o r example, this can be shown for the hydraulic s\'ystcm:\n(1)\n\nHeat to\n\n(2)\n\nTorque through a l t e k i o r \'to-electricity.\n\n(3)\n\nElectricity through motor to torque.\n\n(4)\n\nTorque through pump t o hydraulic power.\n\n(5)\n\nHydraulic power downhole through hydraulic motor t o torque.\n\n(6)\n\nTorque through pump t o p r e s s u r e and flow in well w a t e r .\n\n.\n.\n\nVI.\n\n-\n\n.\n\n-_.\n\n._\n\nTHE SPERRY PUMPING SYSTEM\n\nIn o r d e r to avoid this multiple-energy conversion probIc3i-with its\nattendant loss in efficiency, the S p e r r y Research Center is constructing a\nsystem which w i l l not bring energy down ft0.m-tbe ?ur_frce tp._ap_rate the pump,\n6,ut will instead &*tract enerky from thG hot.\\vcll water downhole at the s i t e\nof the pump. It will have only two energy conversions--heat to torque and\ntorque to .pressure--rather than several. The principle involved is shown\n,\n\nused t o drive a turbine and a\n\nis used t o lubricate\n\n284\n\nthe turbine and pump bearings. Since this clean w a t e r is at a higher p r e s s u r e\nthan the well water, the contaminated well water is prevented f r o m entering\nthe turbine.\nThe boiler manifold contains a threshold valve, which prevents water f r o m\nentering the boiler unless feedwater p r e s s u r e is above well water p r e s s u r e ,\nand the A P valve (mentioned above), which drops feedwater p r e s s u r e t o permit\nboiling and also to permit changing boiler p r e s s u r e by varying feedwater\np r e s s u r e at the surface. Since m a s s flow t o the turbine is a function of boiler\np r e s s u r e , we can effectively control turbine output f r o m the surface.\nAn additional energy saving a c c r u e s f r o m this system, since the energy\nf o r pumping ultimately comes f r o m the well water anyway. It is better to remove\nthis energy downhole. The temperature is thus lowered somewhat and a r r i v e s\nat the surface with a correspondingly lower saturation p r e s s u r e , requiring l e s s\np r e s s u r e added. In a 400\xc2\xb0F well, this typically could amount t o a n additional\n20% energy saving, A t first glance, this process would s e e m to place an\nundue penalty on the efficiency of the surface conversion system as demonstrated by the Carnot principle. Nevertheless, it is e a s y to show that any pump,\nhowever it operates, w i l l remove just its required portion of the available\nenergy f r o m the water. It does not m a t t e r whether it takes this energy f r o m the\ntop of the cycle (as we do), f r o m the bottom of the cycle, o r f r o m a n infinite\nnumber of points in the cycle ( a s i n the c a s e of a pump which takes its energy\nelectrically f r o m the main conversipn system).\n\nA simplified schematic of the turbine-pump unit for our first t e s t is\nshown i n Fig. 5. It is designed to fit in a n 8-5/8-in. casing, although for\nthe field t e s t it will be adapted into a l a r g e r casing,\nThe bearings a r e hydrodynamic and a r e of tilting pad design. The thrust\nbearing has operated on hot water in the lab at t h r e e t i m e s our design load.\nThe ball bearing operates only during start-up, when the high-pressure well\nwater causes an upward t h r u s t on the shaft until pump t h r u s t builds up and\nt h r u s t s the shaft downward through a 0.015-in. end play.\nThe turbine is a two-stage p r e s s u r e , compounded single-wheel design\nwith its exhaust being redirected upward through its spoked hub.\nIn the expected t e s t situation, the pump and t e s t p a r a m e t e r s will be\napproximately as follows:\nWell t e m p e r a t u r e\n\n400" F\n\nTurbine output, nominal\n\n155 H P\n\nTurbine output, max\n\n220 HP\n\nPump output\n\n1000 gpm at\n200 p s i A P\n\nDepth in well\n\n850 f t\n\n285\n\nNPSH\n\n100 psi\n\nW e l l w a t e r AT, nominal\n\n15 to 2 0 \xc2\xb0 F\n\nr Pm\n\n17,000\n\nSpecific speed\n\n5,400\n\nSuction specific speed\n\n8,000\n\nThis first unit h a s been designed with the objective of a successful t e s t\nr a t h e r than efficient performance o r maximum output. The s y s t e m may remove\nf r o m the well water as much as 1 0 \xc2\xb0 F p e r 100 psia added. (Note that this\np a r a m e t e r is independent of the quantity pumped. ) With an optimized system\nand some amount of development, however, we feel that this w i l l drop to\n5" F/100 p s i added, which is an amount considerably below that of any other\napproach w e a r e aware of. Efficiency i n pumping geothermal fluids is, of\ncourse, of prime importance since they have such a s m a l l amount of available\nenergy to begin with.
