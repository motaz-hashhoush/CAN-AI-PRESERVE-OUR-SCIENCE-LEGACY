Downey\nGoddard Space Flight Center\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis experiment provided a year\'s statistical data for the purpose of refining existing\ncoordination procedures for the sharing of common frequency allocations between terrestrial\nand space services. The measurement program was conducted between October 3, 1970, and\nOctober 2, 1971, to empirically determine the cumulative distributions of scattering cross\nsection per unit volume of hydrometeors at heights up to 9 km above the surface and of rain\nrate at the surface. The measurements were made in southeastern Virginia using a bistatic,\ncontinuous-wave (cw), vertically polarized radar system operating at S- and X-band frequencies and tipping-bucket rain gages. The bistatic radar system was configured to represent an interference situation between a radio-relay system and a space communication system Earth terminal; the results may be interpreted as measured distributions of transmission loss for interference due to rain. This report contains a description of the experiment and equipment; the data analysis is covered in a companion report (ref. 13).\nThe experiment was conducted in two parts: the first (October 3, 1970, to June 3,\n1971) emphasized exploration and the second (June 4, 1971, to October 2, 1971) emphasized high accuracy and reliability. The total measurement year spanned 8760 hr during\nwhich 119 rain-scatter events occurred. An event was defined as the occurrence of a 1-min\naveraged rain rate in excess of 1 mm/hr at the surface or an equivalent reflectivity in excess\nui\n\nof 22 dBZ (163-dB transmission loss, which, for this experiment configuration, corresponds\nto the threshold for interference recommended by the International Radio Consultative\nCommittee (CCIR) for Earth terminal receivers operating in the 3.4- to 4.2-GHz frequency\nband). Rain scatter of sufficient intensity to qualify as an event was measured for at least\n1 min of each of a total of 568 hr of the measurement year for the scattering volume at a\n3-km height and of 128 hr at a 6-km height. During the measurement year, 7 hr of rainscatter data were lost due to system outage and 42 hr of rain-gage data were lost due to\nsnow. The overall measurement accuracy varied throughout the year and was \xc2\xb13 dB for the\nbistatic radar measurements and \xc2\xb110 percent for the rain-rate measurements made during\nthe important summer months.\n\nIV\n\nCONTENTS\nPage\nABSTRACT\n1\n\niii\n1\n\n1.1 Background\n1.2 Experiment Approach\n1.3 Summary of Results and Conclusions\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nEXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION\n\n5\n\n2.1\n2.2\n2.3\n2.4\n2.5\n3\n\nExperiment Design Considerations\nExperiment Configuration\nData Processing\nDiscussion of Errors\nOperation Summary\n\n5\n9\n28\n29\n30\n35\n\n3.1\n3.2\n3.3\n3.4\n3.5\n4\n\nBISTATIC RADAR SYSTEM\n\n35\n47\n59\n59\n61\n\nBistatic Transmit System\nBistatic Receiving System (30-ft Dish Receiver)\nGC Path System\nInstrumentation Changes and Effects\nEquipment Error Analysis\n\n69\n\n4.1\n4.2\n4.3\n4.4\n5\n\nRAIN-GAGE SYSTEM\n\n69\n71\n71\n73\n\nCollection and Measurement\nRecording System\nGage Calibration\nError Analysis\n\nDATA PROCESSING\n\n76\n\n5.1 Bistatic Radar Data Reduction\n5.2 Rain-Gage Data Reduction\n\n76\n82\n\nILLUSTRATIONS\nPage\n2-1\n\nExperiment area map\n\n9\n\n2-2\n\nExperiment configuration\n\n10\n\n2-3\n\nPath geometry.\n\n11\n\n2-4\n\nForeground and horizon at the Eastville transmitter site.\n\n15\n\n2-5\n\nForeground and horizon at the Fort Lee transmitter site\n\n15\n\n2-6\n\nForeground and horizon at the LaRC receiver site\n\n16\n\n2-7\n\nSimplified bistatic and GC system block diagram\n\n18\n\n2-8\n\n10K rain-gage siting\n\n25\n\n2-9\n\nSurveillance radar block diagram.\n\n26\n\n3-1\n\nFort Lee transmitter block diagram.\n\n37\n\n3-2\n\nTransmitting antenna patterns\xe2\x80\x94S-band\n\n43\n\n3-3\n\nTransmitting antenna patterns\xe2\x80\x94X-band\n\n43\n\n3-4\n\nEastville transmitter site\n\n46\n\n3-5\n\nFort Lee transmitter site\n\n47\n\n3-6\n\nReceiving antenna pattern\xe2\x80\x94S-band\n\n48\n\n3-7\n\nReceiving antenna pattern-X-band.\n\n49\n\n3-8\n\nLaRC receiving and calibration systems\n\n51\n\n3-9\n\nF2 crystal filter frequency response.\n\n3-10\n\nF2 receiver transfer function\n\n54\n\n3-11\n\nLaRC recording equipment phase II\n\n56\n\n3-12\n\nThirty-foot dish antenna, LaRC receiver site\n\n59\n\n3-13\n\nLaRC receiver site\n\n59\n\n3-14\n\n10K antenna broadband radiated power measurements\n\n67\n\n.\n\nvn\n\n55\n\nILLUSTRATIONS -continued\nPage\n\n3-15\n\n20K antenna broadband radiated power measurements\n\n68\n\n4-1\n\nType I and III rain gages\n\n70\n\n4-2\n\nCalibration curves for type I gages\n\n72\n\n5-1\n\nData processing flow diagram\n\n76\n\n5-2\n\nSample strip chart recording\xe2\x80\x94phase II, September 11, 1971\n\n77\n\n5-3\n\nSample of processed radio data-Eastville, September 11, 1971.\n\n80\n\n5-4\n\nSample recording of LaRC type I rain gagesSeptember 11, 1971\n\n83\n\nSample recording of type II and III gages - September 2 to October 6, 1971\n\n84\n\nSample of type III processed rain gage data - September 11, 1971.\n(To compare with radio data, add 73 min to correct gage\nrecorder data.)\n\n85\n\n5-5\n5-6\n\nvui\n\nTABLES\nPage\n\n1-1\n\nOperating Performance Summary\n\n4\n\n1-2\n\nEquipment Accuracy Summary\n\n4\n\n2-1\n\nSubsystem Summary3\n\n12\n\n2-2\n\nBistatic Radar System Path Summary\n\n14\n\n2-3\n\nBistatic Radar System Parameter (Nominal)\n\n19\n\n2-4\n\nMinimum Detectable Equivalent Reflectivity for\nPrimary Paths\n\n21\n\n2-5\n\nRain-Gage System Summary\n\n23\n\n2-6\n\nSurveillance Radar Summary\n\n26\n\n2-7\n\nOperating Summary\xe2\x80\x94 Number of Hours of Data\n\n31\n\n2-8\n\nOperating Summary\xe2\x80\x94Number of Hours Systems\nWere Inoperable\n\n32\n\nOperating Summary\xe2\x80\x94 Number of Hours Systems Were Inoperable\nDuring Ram Events\n\n33\n\n3-1\n\nFrequency Operation Summary\n\n39\n\n3-2\n\nEquipment Configuration for Phases I and II\n\n40\n\n3-3\n\nTransmitter Antenna Switching Sequence for\nMinutes 1 to 4\n\n41\n\n3-4\n\nTransmitting Transmission Line Loss\n\n42\n\n3-5\n\nAntenna Pointing Angles and Gain\n\n45\n\n3-6\n\nEastville 10K Path Correction Factors\n\n60\n\n3-7\n\nFort Lee 10K Path Correction Factors\n\n60\n\n3-8\n\nEastville 20K Path Correction Factors\n\n61\n\n3-9\n\nFort Lee 20K Path Correction Factors\n\n61\n\n2-9\n\nIX\n\nTABLES\xe2\x80\x94continued\nPage\n3-10\n\nBistatic Radio Equipment Error Summary\n\n63\n\n3-11\n\nSpectrum Error Summary\n\n64\n\n3-12\n\nPin-Diode Error Summary\n\n64\n\n4-1\n\nRain-Gage, Accuracy and Repeatability Estimates\n\n73\n\n5-1\n\nBistatic Radar Data Processing Summary\n\n78\n\n5-2\n\nRain-Gage Chart Reading Precision Estimates\n\n85\n\nVIRGINIA PRECIPITATION SCATTER EXPERIMENTEXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n1.1 BACKGROUND\nInterference between centimeter- or millimeter-wave communication systems operating\nat the same frequency and beyond each other\'s radio horizon may be caused by one or more\nof several propagation mechanisms: tropospheric scatter, terrain diffraction, ducting, and\nrain scatter. The procedures used to assess the possibility of interference (the coordination\nprocedures in effect prior to the revisions prepared at the 1971 World Administrative Radio\nConference for Space Telecommunications (1971 WARC-ST)) paid little attention to rain\nscatter. Early theoretical work by W. Gordon (ref. 1) predicted that rain scatter would\ncause a higher signal level on a troposcatter path than would atmospheric turbulence for\nfrequencies above 100 MHz and rain rates above 1 mm/hr. Measurements in 1958 by\nDoherty and Stone (ref. 2) showed the prediction to be substantially correct. Doherty continued the investigation of bistatic scattering by rain using a short path with a scattering\nvolume just above the surface. He found (ref. 3) that the scattering cross section could be\nstatistically related to the rain rate at the surface. Under NASA sponsorship, Dennis (ref. 4)\nand the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory (now the Institute for Telecommunication\nSciences (ITS)) (ref. 5) made investigations of forward scatter by rain to assess the importance of this phenomenon in causing interference. More recently, both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) (POPSI experiment, ref. 6) and Comsat (ref. 7) conducted\nlong-duration measurement programs to determine the cumulative distributions of transmission loss due to rain. These programs have shown that rain scatter can cause interference\nin communication systems (ref. 8). In 1967, the Office of Telecommunications Management (now Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP)) requested NASA, with the support\nof the FCC, to begin a study of rain interference with the goal of improving coordination\nand interference prediction techniques.\nThe NASA program to study rain-caused interference included (1) the preparation of\nmethods for the estimation of cumulative distributions of surface rain rates (refs. 9 and 10)\nfor use in estimating interference levels, (2) an experimental investigation of the bistatic\nscattering properties of rain using both monostatic and bistatic radars for the assessment\nof the validity of the approximations used to relate the scattered signal levels to meteorological parameters (ref. 11), and (3) the Virginia Precipitation Scatter Experiment. The common\ntheme of the NASA interference studies is the prediction of transmission loss, hence\n\ninterference levels, using the scattering properties of rain and the prediction of the\nscattering properties using available climatological data. The two-step procedure is used because the transmission loss for a variety of transmitting/receiving antenna configurations\nmay be estimated from a knowledge of the spatial and temporal behavior of the scattering\ncross section per unit volume of rain. If only transmission loss measurements are recorded,\nthe results are applicable only to situations involving identical antenna orientation configurations. Although transmission loss estimation is the ultimate goal of the program, the bistatic\nscattering cross section per unit volume, referred to as equivalent reflectivity, is the basic\nparameter of interest.\n1.2 EXPERIMENT APPROACH\nThe Virginia Precipitation Scatter Experiment had the following goals or objectives:\n(1) Demonstrate that rain scatter may cause interference for terminals sited in accordance with the pre-1971 WARC-ST (ref. 12)\n(2) Provide empirically determined cumulative distributions of transmission loss for\na 1-yr measurement period for transmitter/receiver configurations typical of\nradio-relay space communication system Earth terminal interference problems\n(3) Provide empirically determined cumulative distributions of surface rain rate and\nequivalent reflectivity Zg at several heights for use in assessing the effectiveness\nof estimation procedures established under NASA sponsorship or by other\ninvestigators\nThe first goal was of importance prior to the preparatory meetings for the 1971\nWARC-ST; the last goal was of highest priority afterward. The experiment was conducted\nin three phases: the first or exploratory phase (designated as phase la) was directed at goals\n(1) and (2); the second, transitional phase (phase Ib) covered the time required to reconfigure the experiment for the third phase; and the third or high-accuracy phase (phase II)\nwas directed at goals (2) and (3). Phase la was directed by ITS of the Office of Telecommunications with P. Rice as principal investigator. Phases Ib and II were directed by GSFC\nwith R. Crane of MIT Lincoln Laboratory as principal investigator. This report is primarily\nconcerned with the experiment and equipment description. The analysis of the year\'s results\nwith emphasis on the high-accuracy phase is described in a companion report, Virginia\nPrecipitation Scatter Experiment\xe2\x80\x94Data Analysis (ref. 13). The exploratory work has been\nseparately reported by ITS (ref. 14).\nThe equivalent reflectivity measurements were made with a bistatic radar system operating at frequencies of 3.7 GHz (S-band) and 7.8 GHz (X-band). A 30-ft (9.1-m) vertically\npolarized receiving antenna oriented at an elevation angle of 13.5\xc2\xb0 was used to represent a\ntypical Earth terminal in the fixed satellite communication service. Transmitters were\nlocated at four sites between 30 and 180 km from the receiving antenna. At S-band, 10-ft\n(3.0-m) vertically polarized transmitting antennas were used; at X-band, 6-ft (1.8-m) vertically polarized antennas were used. The transmitting antennas were oriented at elevation\n\nangles between 0.3\xc2\xb0 and 8.4\xc2\xb0 to represent terminals typical of the terrestrial radio-relay\nservice. A total of 24 transmitter/receiver paths were used to investigate scattering from precipitation at heights of 5000, 10 000, 20 000, and 30 000 ft (1.5, 3.0, 6.1, and 9.1 km; hereafter referred to as 5K, 10K, 20K, and 30K) for scattering angles ranging from 15\xc2\xb0 to 171\xc2\xb0.\nAll 24 paths were used only during the exploratory phase and part of the transitional phase.\nData for the measurement year, October 3, 1970, through October 2, 1971, were obtained at\nS-band using only the 3- and 6-km heights and scattering angles near 90\xc2\xb0. Although the\nbistatic radar system was configured to duplicate communication systems in a typical interference problem, the measurement of interest was the equivalent reflectivity because it allows\nthe results to be extrapolated to other path configurations. Because the basic measurement\nwas reflectivity, the measurement system will be referred to as a bistatic radar system throughout this report. Conversion factors will be given to allow the results to be interpreted as\ntransmission loss. Of the 24 paths, only 18 had antenna beam intersections or common\nvolumes. Of these 18 common volumes, only 11 were small enough to be useful in measuring reflectivity. The other paths were used to represent interference problems with sidelobeto-mainlobe coupling or coupling via other propagation mechanisms.\nSurface rain-rate measurements were made at points below the 5K, 10K, 20K, and 30K\nscattering volumes for the entire experiment period\xe2\x80\x94and additional gages were used at the\ntransmitter and receiver sites in the high-accuracy phase of the experiment. The data for the\nentire year and each phase were processed to provide measurements of 1-min averaged rain\nrate. Additional meteorological data for storm alerts, storm tracking during rain events, and\npost-test analysis were obtained from an onsite S-band surveillance radar, a National Weather\nService (NWS) weather radar, NWS rain gages, NWS upper air soundings (radiosondes), and\nsurface observations made at the transmitter and receiver sites.\nData processing and analysis were accomplished during and after the experiment. Sufficient onsite examination of the data, calibration, and testing were performed to assure data\nquality. Computer reduction was used for phase la data and was performed at ITS. Hand\nreduction was used for phase Ib, phase II, and rain-gage data and was performed at GSFC.\nAnalysis of the phase la data was performed by ITS (ref. 14). Analysis of data for the\nmeasurement year and of the auxiliary meteorological support data was performed at MIT\nLincoln Laboratory (ref. 13).\n1.3 SUMMARY OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe experiment and equipment described in this report provided for the measurement of\nequivalent reflectivity and surface rainfall rates for a period of 1 yr. From these measurements\ncumulative distributions were prepared and analyzed (ref. 13). Of the 119 known rain events\n(either scatter level or rain rate above threshold) that occurred during the year, bistatic radar\ndata were recorded and processed for a total of 107 events and rain-gage data for 82 events. A\nsummary of the operating record of the primary measurement systems is given in table 1 -1. Because of equipment and path redundancy, the only bistatic data loss occurred when the receiver\nwas not functioning (with the exception of 1 hr, for the 3-km height, when transmitters malfunctioned simultaneously at the Eastville and Fort Lee sites). This occurred for a total of 7 of\n\nTable 1-1.\xe2\x80\x94Opera ting Performance Summary\n\nMeasurement period\n\nHours with\nmeasurements above\nevent criteria and\nsystem operational\nBistatic\n\nGage\n\nEvent hours with\nequipment not\noperational\n\nHours not\noperational\nBistatic\n\nGage\n\nBistatic\n\nGage\n\n3km\n\nPhase la\nPhase Ib\nPhase II\nEntire measurement year\n\n6 km\n\nSurface\n\n3km\n\n6 km\n\nSurface\n\n3km\n\n6 km\n\nSurface\n\n176\n249\n143\n568\n\n10\n23\n95\n128\n\n154\n192\n121\n467\n\n1\n36\n95\n132\n\n1\n39\n95\n135\n\n12\n30\n0\n42\n\n1\n4\n2\n7\n\n0\n4\n2\n6\n\n12\n30\n0\n42\n\nTotal\nTotal\nduration of\nmeasurementrain events, hr period hours\n\n2904\n2952\n2904\n8760\n\n256\n395\n247\n898\n\nTable 1-2.\xe2\x80\x94Equipment Accuracy Summary\nAccuracy, dBa\nSystem\n\nSite\n\nPath\nPhase I\n\nBistatic radar system\n\nEastville\nFort Lee\nBest composite\n\nRain-gage system\n\n10K\n20K\n10K\n20K\n10K\n20K\n\n5K, 10K, 20K\nLangley, Eastville, Fort\n\n4.0, -5.0\n6.9, -4.9\n9.9, -4.9\n9.9, -4.9\n4.0, -5.0\n6.9, -4.9\n\xc2\xb11.6 b ,\xc2\xb11.8 c\nNot used\n\nPhase II\n\n\xc2\xb13.5\n5.8, -2.8\n8.8, -2.8\n\xc2\xb13.0\n\xc2\xb12.9\n\xc2\xb13.0\n\xc2\xb11.6 b ,\xc2\xb11.7 c\n\xc2\xb10.7 b ,\xc2\xb10.7 c\n\nLee\na\nWhen applied to the rain gage system, dB refers to the maximum value for rate measurements expressed in dBZ\nusing Z = 200fl 1 \' 6 ordBZ = 23+ 16 logR.\nb\n12mm/hr.\nC\n100mm/hr.\n\n898 hr of rain events at the 3-km height (99.2 percent reliability) and for 6 of 898 hr at the\n6.1-km height (99.3 percent reliability). For the rain-gage system, data were lost only when\nsnow and ice prevented operation of all gages simultaneously. This occurred for a total of\n42 of the 898 hr of rain events (95.3 percent reliability). Bistatic radar data were missed\nduring three events because of receiver malfunction. For two of these events, the rain-gage\ndata indicate that only low-level signals were present; therefore, these two events will not\naffect the cumulative distributions. The other event missed was one of 18 events with surface rain rates exceeding 50 mm/hr. Although the event was significant because of the high\nrates, events with higher rain rates were observed and the distribution estimation error\nshould be small. The gage data missed because of snow should have only a small effect on\nthe measured cumulative distributions of surface rain rate because the effective precipitation\nrates in snow are generally quite small.\n\nSystem measurement accuracy varied throughout the year depending upon the monitoring and calibration equipment available and the number of operating personnel in the\nfield. The system accuracy estimates are summarized in table 1-2. As shown in the table,\nthe accuracy for phase II (high-accuracy phase) is \xc2\xb12.9 and \xc2\xb13.0 dB for the measurements\nof equivalent reflectivity for the best composite 1 OK and 20K paths, respectively. The\naccuracy estimate for reflectivity Z based upon surface rain-rate measurements made during\nthe same period is \xc2\xb10.7 dB. The accuracy of the equivalent reflectivity measurements for thu\nbest composite paths used to provide data for 1-yr distributions (phase la) is estimated to be\n+4.0 and -5.0 dB for the 10K and +6.9 and -4.9 dB for the 20K path. The accuracy of the\nreflectivity estimate based upon rain-gage data is \xc2\xb11.8 dB for the measurement year.\n2 EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION\nThis section describes the overall characteristics and operation of the Virginia Precipitation Scatter Experiment. It contains sections on experiment design, experiment configuratio\ndata processing, and errors and an operation summary. Other sections of this report will\ndescribe the bistatic radar and rain-gage systems and data processing in greater detail.\n2. 1 EXPERIMENT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\nThe Virginia Precipitation Scatter Experiment was designed to provide the cumulative\ndistributions of transmission loss for a variety of transmitting/receiving antenna orientations\nand distances for use in preparing methods for the estimation of coordination distance for a\ngiven transmission loss L(p), which must be exceeded for all but p, the percent of the year.\nIn addition, the experiment was designed to demonstrate that the measured transmission\nloss values may be\' less than 162 dB for 0.01 percent of the year or that interference due to\nrain could occur.\nA procedure for the estimation of a coordination distance for rain was incorporated in\nappendix 28 of the Radio Regulations as adopted at the 1971 WARC-ST (ref. 15). This\nprocedure was prepared from the results of computations based upon single scattering\ntheory, the bistatic radar equation, and the statistical properties of an ensemble of randomly\npositioned hydrometeors. The equation for transmission loss or the ratio of\xc2\xb0the interfering\nsignal power transmitted by one system to that received by another used in the preparation\nof coordination procedures is given by equation (1 ) of reference 8:\nPt\n\nr\\\n(1)\n\nPr\nwhere\nL = transmission loss\nPf = transmitter power (mW)\nPr = receiver power (mW)\n\nC R G 2 (r 2 )Z e D\n\nr2 = distance from antenna 2 to the scattering volume (km)\nCR - equipment constant ~6 X 10~ 18 /A 2 , X = wavelength (cm)\nG2 (f 2 ) = gain of antenna 2 in the direction of the scattering volume (Antenna 2 refers\nto the antenna with the broadest beam at the scattering volume for mainlobeto-mainlobe coupling or the antenna whose sidelobes are involved in sidelobeto-mainlobe coupling.)\nZe - equivalent reflectivity; equal to the value of reflectivity as measured by a\nradar when the scattering cross section is formally related to Z using Rayleigh theory and the dielectric properties of liquid water (for rain and frequencies below 10 GHz, Ze = Z) (mm 6 /m 3 )\nZ = reflectivity; equal to the sum of the sixth powers of the raindrop diameters\nin a unit volume and is a meteorological parameter that depends only on\nrain-rate and raindrop-size distribution (mm 6 /m 3 )\nD = extent of the scattering volume along the mainlobe of antenna 1 as defined\nby rain-cell size or, in the case of mainlobe-to-mainlobe coupling, the beamwidth of antenna 2 given by /- 2 0 2 /sin 0, whichever yields the smallest value\n(km)\n02 = beamwidth of antenna 2 (radians)\n0 = scattering angle\nEquation (1) (p. 5) is recommended for use at frequencies below 5 GHz because the effect\nof attenuation has been neglected. For use in estimating coordination distances, the transmission loss required to provide adequate protection against interference must be known.\nWhen the specific system parameters are not known, it is recommended that (ref. 15)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa3(0.01)= 177- 10 log 7^\n\ndB\n\n(2)\n\nbe used for the frequency band 3.4 to 4.2 GHz for the protection of fixed satellite system\nEarth terminals from interference from typical radio-relay systems. In this equation L(0.01)\nis the transmission loss that must be exceeded for all but 0.01 percent of the year and TR\nis the receiver noise temperature in kelvins. For a low-noise receiver system with\nTR = 50 K, Z,(0.01) may not be less than 160 dB. The pre-1971-WARC-ST coordination\nprocedure as given in reference 12 also specifies a minimum basic transmission loss for the\nprotection of fixed satellite system Earth terminals. From section 4 of reference 12,\nL b (O.Ol) = P T - F s - ( P W + B ) - I C + G T + G R\nwhere\nLb (0.01) = basic transmission loss required for all but 0.01 percent of the year (dB)\n= L(O.Ol) + GT + GR\nPT = terrestrial station transmitter power in a 4-kHz band (dBW)\n\n(3)\n\nFS = site shielding (dB)\nPW = carrier power subject to interference in a 4-kHz band at the receiver input\n(dBW)\nB, Ic = parameters relating to the statistical properties of the interfering signal and\nthe susceptibility of the assumed modulation technique to interference\n(dB)(Seeref. 12.)\nGT = radio-relay (terrestrial) antenna gain (dBi)\nGR = Earth station antenna gain (dBi)\nUsing the values for (PT + G T ), PW , B, and Ic for a 12-channel, angle-modulated satellite\ncommunication system and a typical radio-relay system as given in reference 12, and assuming GT = 40 dBi and FS - 0, the transmission loss that must be exceeded for all but 0.01\npercent of the year is 162 dB.\nAn underlying element in the design of the bistatic radar system was to duplicate\ntypical Earth stations and terrestrial microwave radio-relay stations in typical interfering configurations. The frequencies selected were 3.7 and 7.8 GHz, in or near frequency bands\nallocated for shared space and terrestrial communication system use. A total of 24 transmitter antenna orientation, scattering angle, scattering volume height, frequency, and distance\ncombinations or paths were used. The transmitter sites were positioned and antenna pointing angles adjusted so that on 11 of the paths no measurable received signal could be\nobtained by nonprecipitation propagation mechanisms in accordance with pre-1971-WARCST siting criteria. These paths were used for the bistatic scatter cross-section measurement\nbecause they were free of contamination by other propagation modes. For economy, the\nreceiver system multiplexed the 24 combinations into eight receiving recording channels by\nsampling each of the paths for 1 min out of every 4 (except as noted in table 3-3). During\nthe 1-min sampling interval, continuous-wave (cw) transmission was used. The experiment\nwas operated in this mode for the duration of the exploratory phase (phase la, 2904 hr\nfrom October 3, 1970, through January 31, 1971).\nAcceptance and use of equation (1) (p. 5) implies that sufficient information for\ntesting the statistical performance of transmission loss prediction schemes may be obtained\nfrom measurements of Ze at several heights. The rain-cell-size model used in conjunction\nwith equation (1) in preparing the coordination procedure assumed that all cells have a\nuniform horizontal size of 3.5 km at the half scattering intensity points. Using a cell size of\n3.5 km and typical cell translation velocities of 10 to 20 m/s, the cell would pass through\nthe scattering volume in 3 to 6 min. A sampling sequence that observed the equivalent reflectivity of a scattering volume for 1 min out of 4 was not compatible with the requirement of\nreliably measuring the cumulative distribution of the short duration scatter phenomena for\npercentages of the time between 0.001 to 0.01 percent of the year (5 to 53 min) as required for\ninterference prediction. To provide the required measurements and to increase the reliability\nof the bistatic cw radar system by both simplifying the system and providing redundant\nmeasurements, the number of scattering volume heights investigated was reduced to two\n\n(10K and 20K), the number of transmitting sites was reduced to two (Eastville and Fort\nLee), the X-band measurements were eliminated, and the sampling sequence was modified.\nWith this reconfiguration, simultaneous observations of scatter from the volume at 3-km\nheight were made using transmissions from both sites. Continuous observations at the 6-km\nheight were made using alternate 1-min-duration transmission from one site and then the\nother. During the alternate minutes, when the 6-km height was not sampled, the great circle\n(GC) path was sampled to study both sidelobe-to-mainlobe coupling and other propagation\nmechanisms. The reconfigured experiment was operated for the duration of the highaccuracy phase (II), 2904 hr from June 4, 1971, through October 2, 1971. The transitional\nphase (Ib) of the experiment covered the 2952 hr of operation between January 31, 1971,\nand June 4, 1971, during which time the experiment reconfiguration was accomplished.\nA goal of the NASA rain interference study program is the estimation of the statistics of interference levels using available meteorological data. The rain coordination procedure (ref. 15)\naccomplishes this through the use of rain climate zones, each characterized by a specific\ncumulative distribution of surface rain rate and specific values for rain-cell height and width\n(ref. 8). One-min-averaged rain-rate distributions were measured, both under the scattering\nvolumes used in the bistatic radar system and at several of the transmitting and receiving\nsites. The measurements were made to construct reflectivity distributions for comparison\nwith the measured equivalent reflectivity distributions, the distribution used in reference 15\nto characterize the rain climate of southeastern Virginia, and distributions proposed by\nother investigators. The rain-gage measurements were averaged over a 1 -min interval as a\ncompromise between the requirement for a long measurement interval to reduce sampling\nnoise and a short interval to track changes due to cell motion.\nSurface rain accumulation measurements were obtained from the NWS gages located in\nthe general area of the experiment to aid in assessing the measurement accuracy of the\nexperiment gages and to provide a tie between the particular measurement year and the\nclimatology of the area. For storm alerting, to track storms in progress, and as an aid in\nestablishing the general synoptic weather conditions for each rain event, weather radar data\nfrom the NWS station at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland were monitored. An\nonsite S-band radar was also used in this capacity to track rain cells in the vicinity of the\nscattering volumes and to qualitatively indicate the change of equivalent reflectivity with\nheight. Surface and upper air temperature soundings were required to establish the existence\nof rain or snow at the surface during the winter months and to indicate hydrometeor state\nchanges with height. The surface data were obtained using meteorographs (an instrument\nfor measuring temperature, pressure, and relative humidity) located at several of the transmitter and receiver sites. Upper air data were obtained from NWS radiosonde measurements.\nGC path transmissions were monitored throughout the experiment to aid in assessing\nthe possible contamination of the bistatic radar measurements by signals propagated via\nother mechanisms. During phases Ib and II, this system used 10-ft (3.0-m) transmitting\nantennas at both of the transmitter sites and horn antennas at the receiver site. The GC\npath antennas were oriented at elevation angles below 1\xc2\xb0 and pointed at each other along a\ngreat circle. The GC path transmissions were also monitored via the sidelobes of the 30-ft\nreceiving antenna.\n8\n\nDulles \xe2\x80\xa2\nNWS Radiosonde\n\nWEST VIRGINIA\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nWallops Island\nNWS Radiosonde\nPainter\nNWS Rain Gage\n\nLaRC, Hampton\nRadio Rev\nRain Gages\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nGreensboro\nNWS Radiosonde\n\n40\n\n80\nKILOMrTERS\n\n120\n\nCape Hatteras\nNWS Radiosonde\n\n160\n\nFigure 2-1.\xe2\x80\x94Experiment area map.\n\n2.2 EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION\nThe primary measurement systems and auxiliary meteorological support systems were\nlocated in southeastern Virginia as shown on the experiment area map, figure 2-1.

The receiving antenna was directed along the GC toward Quantico at an elevation angle of 13.5\xc2\xb0. Antennas at the transmitter sites were directed towards the 5K, 10K,\n20K, and 30K scatter volumes on the receiver mainlobe as specified in table 2-2. At Quantico, Eastville, and Fort Lee, antennas were also directed along the GC toward LaRC to provide a reference troposcatter path. The paths from Eastville and Fort Lee to the receiver via\nthe 10K and 20K scatter volumes are considered the primary bistatic radar measurement\npaths because of (1) their relatively small scattering volume dimensions (2) the relatively\nlarge angular distance between the GC and mainlobe azimuth directions (which helps suppress contamination via other propagation mechanisms).\nThe general terrain in the experiment area over which the scatter paths pass can be\ncharacterized as low rolling hills with large areas of water. The paths from Fort Lee to\nLaRC and the common volumes of intersection are mainly over land; the paths from Eastville are mainly over water. Obstructions along the path are possible only in the immediate\nforeground of the antennas because of the nature of the terrain and relatively high elevation\nangles. The photographs in figure 2-4 were taken at Eastville from just in front of the\nantennas at approximately the antenna height. The ground in front of the antennas is grass\ncovered to the thin row of trees at a fence line approximately 0.3 km from the antennas.\nBeyond the tree line is cultivated land. To the right under the 30K antenna beam there is a\nheavy grove of trees. The cross marks the top of the tree line at the antenna azimuth and\nthe circle marks the approximate position and size of the antenna main beam. The angular\nseparation between the obstructions and tree line for the 10K, 20K, and 30K paths is large\nand, due to the transmitting antenna patterns, the paths may be considered to be unobstructed or have no site shielding. For these paths the maximum sidelobe level in the direction for specular reflection from the flat field in the foreground is -30 dB with respect to\nthe peak of the mainlobe and, assuming a unity reflection coefficient, the maximum effect\nof surface multipath is to change the signal level at the common volume by less than 0.3 dB.\nThe 5K path has treetops at the center of the mainlobe. The trees are deciduous and in the\nwinter provide a minimum of blockage and attenuation due to scatter. For phase la, the\npath may be considered unobstructed; it was not used during the other phases. The GC path\nis shown as passing through the trees. This path was not used for quantitative measurements\nand any blockage effects were ignored.\nThe foreground of the Fort Lee site is shown in figure 2-5. At this site, the foreground\nout to the grove of trees is mainly asphalt paving and, for the 1 OK and 20K paths, is\nilluminated only by sidelobe levels less than - 15 dB with respect to the peak of the mainlobe. For these paths, the maximum sidelobe level for specular reflection is less than -26\ndB with respect to the peak of the mainlobe resulting in less than a 0.4-dB change in the\nsignal at the common volume due to multipath. The distance to the trees is about 0.7 km.\nBoth the GC and 10K paths show obstructions by rather dense stands of trees. The trees\nare coniferous and their electrical properties should change only slightly with season. Using\nsimple knife-edge diffraction theory to bound the possible effect of the obstruction and for\nthe distance, wavelength, beamwidth, and common volume size that apply to this path, the\n13\n\n^H^H^^--^\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2a\n\nit\n-I\n\nrJ(NfS\n\nrso) r o m O O O\n\ncsrN(NO\n\nN"\n\n\xc2\xab> \'S\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2T3\n\nSSSSSlololoIoSSSlololoSSSSloIoloSS\n\n-J\n\na\no\non\n\nft,\n\n\xc2\xab pa\nS -a\no\n\n^\n\nSSSS\n\n00\n\n- .s c"\nS .s i E\n2\n\nc\n\n< g- "*\n\no\n\n^O c^ v^\nco ON\n"^ ^ *\xe2\x80\xa2H ^^ co\nc\xc2\xabi OO ("*\xe2\x80\xa2 t^~\nOO(S\ni\xe2\x80\x94iro\no\xc2\xbb-\'\'-Hfn^o i\xe2\x80\x94< <N ^H\n\nSSSSS\n\np: p: p: P\n\nr,^r,cn\n\n\xc2\xab\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xbb\n\nso-\n\no^mox^\n\n(U\n\n5\n%-<\n\n0=0^^\n\n-H-HtN<N\n\n\xe2\x80\x94I \xe2\x80\x94I (S\n\nmc^\n\n0)\xc2\xabN^-C~10\n\nfO^-<NVO\n\nra^-r^^\n\n60 C\n\nI\nd>\no\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\n\nr. r~ vo\n\n-\n\nc > E c\n\xe2\x80\x94 \xc2\xa7 2 \xc2\xa3\n2 -\xc2\xb0\n\nO)\n\n\xc2\xa3S\n\nO\n\nto\n\nSO\n\n03\n\nf:f=P:\n\nO\\ ^ vo O\nO \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94i m -^\n\n^\n\nS\n\nI\n\nS\n\nJj" Ml\n&0 3J\n\nS c -o\n\n0>\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94 1 \xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\x941\n\nC/3\n\n*o\n\nvo r^ * os *\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94 1\n\n\'\n\n^ ^ ^ ^\nT\xe2\x80\x941\n\nCQ\n\no\nOH\n\n1\n\nV\n\ns\n\n00\n\nGJ\nl-i\n\n6\nO\nC\nCO\n\nrtr4^Mm\n\nrt(N\n\nrfn\n\nrtMm-,\n\nQJ\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\nrtrlm\n\nO\n\n\'g\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n00\nC\n\no\n\n\xc2\xb0 ^ 5; S\n\nca\n\n\xc2\xb0 \xc2\xa33\n\nfS p\n\nSS5K\xc2\xb0\n\n5S\xc2\xb0?5\n\n\xe2\x80\xa24-J\n\nO\n\nOJ\n\n|\nE\nU\n\nV O - < ^\n\nO m\n\n-HtNOOf^Tl-\n\nOOnT)--H\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2a\n\n-ncokOOv\n\n-Hmo>\n\ncn^o\n\nm^ors^om\n\n<Nvoo\\m\n\nB\n\nc\n\noo\nC\nc w\n.3 <a\n\n0.\n8\n\n_\n\n^\n\n\xc2\xa3\n_E\n\n^\n\nm o l\n\n_ H\n\nC N\n\nI\n^\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2a "\nU\n(U\n== N\n\na\xc2\xab\n\nC\n\nKB,\n\ng\n\nrt\n\n~"\n\nO T3\n\nC "3\nI S\n\n.S \'i\n\xe2\x80\xa2o a,1"\n8 \xe2\x80\x9e\n3\nS\n\n^ O O ^ C O\n\nir\n\n(N\n\n\'\xc2\xa7\n\nO O N < N ^ ) 0 > 0 0 ^ - . t - O C S C S C N O\n\n)\n\nC N 0 1 < N m t -\n\nSsSssSSssRS^^s^^SSS^SSSsi\n\nE\n\nop.\n5\nX\n\n\xc2\xa3\nu.\n\nO.\n\n3\n\nP\n\nt!\nsi\n\nmgagsgSiissgsssgagfcssgn\n-HCscnn-^^f-oocftO-HrqmTr^vot-oooNO-tNmT)73\n\n"5 J\n\nu -a -o\nu u\n\nTS -o\n\n4\nMl\n\xc2\xa7\n\nI\n\n\xc2\xa7\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3\n>\n\nB\nS\nO\n\xc2\xab =E\n10\n\ns 8\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2S \xc2\xa3^ o.\'a\n\xe2\x80\xa2^\n\nB ^\n.SMS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o -s \xc2\xabr\ni^ii-6\nO,\n\n(t> :\n\n11\n\n* -S "\n\nNUS(S3\n\n-\n\nc\n\nj w\n\nu,\n\n^\n\n14\n\na\n\nz\n\nO T3\n\nCJ\n\neffect of the trees is to reduce the size of\nthe common volume by blocking a fraction\nof the beam. From the photograph it appears\nthat for the pointing angles listed in table\n2-2 indicated by the circle, the trees block\nless than one-third of the beam and the\nadditional path loss is estimated to be between 0 and 2 dB.\nThe foreground of the receiving antenna\nis shown in figure 2-6 and is a composite\nphotograph over a 180\xc2\xb0 arc. The approximate azimuth and elevation scales are marked\non the border of the photograph. On the\nGC path toward Eastville, about 57.7\xc2\xb0\nazimuth, there is a small grove of trees with\nmarsh grass and open water beyond; toward\nFort Lee, about 281.7\xc2\xb0 azimuth, there is a\ngrove of trees in the immediate foreground,\nthen a short open space and more trees.\nFor scattering from the 5K, 10K, 20K, and\n30K volumes, no obstructions are evident.\nFor the GC path from Fort Lee, however,\nblockage does occur due to the trees in the\nimmediate foreground for signals received\neither by the horn antennas or the sidelbbes\nof the 30-ft antenna. Receiving antenna\npattern measurements were made using a\nsource on the boresight tower located at\nazimuth and elevation angles of 2.4\xc2\xb0 and\n1.4\xc2\xb0, respectively. A clump of trees may\nbe seen midway between the antenna and\nthe tower. The trees were just below the\nline of sight and using simple knife-edge\ndiffraction theory and the signal level at\ntreetop as determined from the pattern of\nthe 30-ft antenna, an error of 0.5 dB may\noccur in the measurement of antenna gain.\n\nFigure 2-4.\xe2\x80\x94Foreground and horizon at the Eastville transmitter site.\n\n2.2.1.2 System Summary\nThe bistatic scatter measurements were\nmade using vertically polarized cw transmission from switched antennas at the\n\nFigure 2-5.\xe2\x80\x94Foreground and horizon at the Fort\nLee transmitter site.\n\n15\n\n\xe2\x80\x94s\n\nO\nQC\n\nO\nN\n\nC\n\nro\n\nO\n\nI.\nCO\nOJ\nI\n!\nO)\n\nMM\n\nO\n\nID\n\nMil!

A simplified system block\ndiagram is given in figure 2-7. All transmitter sites were similar, the differences being in the\nnumber of antennas, their pointing angles, and the number and frequency of the transmitters\n(described in sec. 3). The rf frequencies were derived independently from a single standard\nfrequency oscillator at each site having a 24-hr stability of five parts in 101 \xc2\xb0. The rf output\nof each transmitter was nominally 10 W and was stabilized by means of an rf leveling loop.\nThe antennas used were 10-ft (3.0-m) parabolic dishes at S-band and 6-ft (1.8-m) dishes at\nX-band. Radiofrequency monitoring equipment was provided along with a telephone line\ntelemetry system to display the operating status of the transmitters at the receiver site.\nAt the receiver site a single 30-ft (9.1-m) parabolic dish with a dual-frequency feed\nhorn was used. After rf amplification in a tunnel diode preamplifier with a noise figure of\napproximately 8 dB, the signals were heterodyned down to 9.6 MHz where they were\nseparated by narrowband crystal filters, each having a nominal bandwidth of 2 kHz. Adjacent channel rejection was approximately 60 dB. Each crystal filter was followed by a loglinear amplifier-detector that had a dc output proportional to the log of the amplitude of\nthe i.f. input signal. The receiver system had a dynamic range in excess of 50 dB. Calibration of the system was automatic and occurred every 2 hr. An override capability was provided for canceling a calibration if desired. This option was exercised on several occasions\nduring periods of strong received scatter signals. Means were provided at the transmitter\nand receiver sites for monitoring and recording critical signal and voltage levels. A summary\nof the bistatic radar system characteristics is given in table 2-3. Data from the receiver systems were recorded on an eight-channel strip chart and a 14-channel analog magnetic tape.\nThe data bandwidth for both recording systems was from dc to approximately 100 Hz.\nDuring phase II, the 1 OK paths from Eastville and Fort Lee were illuminated continuously and an automatic switchover capability was provided so that if the 1 OK transmitter\nfailed, the GC-20K transmitter would automatically be substituted in its place. The GC-20K\npaths were sampled alternately (switched) providing a sample of 1 min of every 2 for each\npath. Timing for the switching cycle was derived independently at each site from the standard oscillator. Temperature stabilization of critical components in both the transmitter and\nreceiver systems was provided to maintain gain stability. The signals received from the 10K\nintersections were integrated (1.5-s time constant) prior to recording on the strip charts.\nSpare data recorders were provided. Calibration was performed on one narrowband receiver\nchannel at a time while the other channels operated to maintain continuity of data.\nDuring phase I the automatic switchover capability was not provided, and the 10K\npaths were switched. The switching sequence provided a sampling of 1 min out of every 4\nwith the exception of four paths as indicated in table 3-3. Timing for the transmitter\nswitching was controlled from the receiver site via the telemetry system for the period listed\nin table 3-2. With this method, synchronization would be lost occasionally because of\ntelephone line "hits" and outages. Also, during phase I, a diplexer was used to separate Sand X-band signals and an X-band receiver was provided. Temperature stabilization was not\nprovided. The calibration system was less accurate and required-more time. The transmitters were not operated during the entire calibration sequence causing a net loss of 15 min of\n\n17\n\nSTANDARD\nFREQUENCY\nOSCILLATOR\n\nANALOG FM\nMAGNETIC TAPE\nRECORDER\n\n_\n\n\'\n\n!|1\n\ntin\n\nI\'M\n|\n\nHi !\n\nLOG\nAMPLIFIERS AND\nDETECTORS\n\n1\n1\nu.\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\'\n\ni\n<\xc2\xa3\n\nI\ni\n\n= K\n3\n3\n\n1\n\n3\n\ni\n\nPOSTDETECTION\n\nQ 3 5\n\n1-\n\n\'\n\n1\n\n1\n\'\n\n\xc2\xa7a\n\n1\n\nsi\ns\n:\n\n1\n\n,.\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\ni\n1\ni\ni\n\nc\n\nI\n1\n\n\xc2\xa3*\n\no2\nS3\n\nI\n\nO uj\n\no>"\n\n1\n\n^1\n\n1\nT:\n\n\'\n\nE\nE\n\ni\n\n\'-5\n\n!\n\n1\n\ni:\n\n1\nI\n\nsS\n\nf\n1\n\xc2\xa7\n55 -^\n1\n\n= i\n^\n\ni\n\nI\n\nij\n1\nlei\n\nf\no:\n\n1\n\nlltl\njjjo\n\n1\n\n[_\n1\n\n1\n\ns\n\ng5\n\nJ\xc2\xa7\n\ni\n\n*\nf\n\nI\n\nI\n\ni\nf\n\n!\n\n:\n1\n\n1\n\ni\n\xc2\xa7\nu\ncc u\no\n\n8\n\n1\n1\n\nf\n\n1\nec\n\ni\n\nI\n\nQ\n\n\'\n\nt\n\ng\n\na\n\no\n\no\n\ni i\nto\n\n1\nu\n\nr>\n\n1\n|\n\n+3\n. <O\n\n11\n\nPs\n\n/\nVN\n\nI1\n\ng\n\nE\nE\n\nec\n\ni "\n4\n\n^^\n\n5 0 - 1\n\n1C\n\nDETECTORS\n\nSTANDARD\nFREQUENCY\n\nPOSTDETECTtON\nFILTERS\n\ni\n\n\\\n\n3 \xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x94\n\n1\n\njj z\n\n\xc2\xa38\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\ny=\n\nSs\n\n>_,\n\n5 oc\n\nT\n\n1\n\n0\n\n^S\n\n!.3\xc2\xa7\n\no\n\n1\n\ni i\n\nJ\n\n/\n\n1\n\ni\n\\\n\n\'\n\n5\n\n51\n\n1\n\nT3\n\n|\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\ng\nS\n\ni\n\n.2\n\n:\n\nE\n\n1\n\nCO\n\nCN\n\n18\n\nTable 2-3.\xe2\x80\x94Bistatic Radar System Parameters (Nominal)\nSystem parameters\n\nS-band\n\n10ft\nVertical\n38.8 dBi\n1.95\xc2\xb0\n-22 dB\n4.4 dB\n10W\n3.672 GHz\n5 X 10-10/day\n\n6ft\nVertical\n4 1.0 dBi\n1.6\xc2\xb0\n-21 dB\n3.6 dB\n10W\n7. 834 GHz\n5 X 10"10/day\n\n30ft\nVertical\n48.0 dBi\n0.68\xc2\xb0\n-21 dB\n8dB\n2kHz\n50 dB\n5 X 10-10/day\n\nTransmitter:\nAntenna diameter\nAntenna polarization\nAntenna gain\nBeamwidth (3 dB)\nSidelobe levels\nTransmission line loss\nTransmitter output power\nFrequency\nFrequency stability\nReceiver:\nAntenna diameter\nAntenna polarization\nAntenna gain\nBeamwidth (3 dB)\nSidelobe levels\nSystem noise figure\nBandwidth\nDynamic range\nFrequency stability\n\nX-band\n\n30ft\nVertical\n50.8 dBi\n0.40\xc2\xb0\n-18 dB\n16 dB\n2kHz\n50 dB\n5 X 10"10/day\n\ndata every 2 hr.

The\nsensitivity of the bistatic radar system for the measurement of equivalent reflectivity may be\ndetermined from this equation and from the nominal transmitter and receiver characteristics\nlisted in table 2-3.

The Sband system has sufficient sensitivity to detect signals corresponding to the interference\nthreshold (162-dB transmission loss) of an Earth terminal receiver system. For optimum\n\n21\n\nreceiver operation, the input signal should, however, be in the range from - 114 to -64\ndBmW corresponding to the region where the receiver output voltage is linearly related to\nthe logarithm of the amplitude of the input signal. At S-band this corresponds to transmission loss values between 154 and 104 dB and equivalent reflectivity values between 30\nand 80 dBZ, respectively.\' Using the "standard" relationship between equivalent reflectivity\nand rain rate (ref. 17),\nZ=200/? 1 \' 6\n(9)\nwhere R is in mm/hr, the measurement range is between 3 and 3700 mm/hr, and the minimum detectable rain rate for S/N= 10 dB corresponds to 0.8 mm/hr. The minimum detectable rain rate for the primary paths is listed in table 2-4.\n2.2.1.4 Operating Procedure\nDuring phase II, all sites were manned during precipitation events and systems were\ncalibrated before and after each event. During clear weather the transmitter systems were\nchecked daily and the antenna pointing positions and radiated power were tested every 2\nweeks. (See sec. 3.5.) The receiver site was manned and checked during the day and spot\nchecked at night. At all times a single individual, the "duty officer of the day," was responsible for monitoring the system and the weather and for calling storm alerts or watches\nwhen rain was possible or likely. When this situation existed the duty officer notified designated operations personnel, who went to the sites and calibrated the systems. Operations\npersonnel lived close to the sites and could normally reach them less than % hr after notification. On occasion, operating personnel notified the duty officer that local conditions were\nsuch that a rain event was likely.\nDuring phase I, the transmitter sites operated unattended. They were checked and\ncalibrated weekly and when the remote status display system indicated transmitter malfunction. The receiving site was manned during the day and all personnel were on standby\n24 hr a day. Storm alerts were called by all operating personnel.\n2.2.2 Rain-Gage Network\n2.2.2.1 System Summary\nThe rain-gage network consisted of a total of seven tipping-bucket gages\xe2\x80\x94three located\nbeneath the 5K, 10K, and 20K scattering volumes, one at Eastville, one at Fort Lee, and two\nat LaRC\xe2\x80\x94and a collecting rain gage at the LaRC receiver site for measuring the total\naccumulation for each event. Three of the four gages used at the sites also had catchment\ncontainers for measuring total accumulation. Two additional gages were part of the original\ninstallation, one beneath the 30K scatter volume and the other at the boresight tower, but\nthese gages were subject to an excessive number of failures and were not used in the data\nanalysis.\nThe tipping-bucket gages were used to measure the 1-min averaged rain rate used in\nconstructing rain-rate distributions. The locations and calibration constants for each gage\n22\n\nand experiment phase are shown in table 2-5. Except for the 1829-cm2-collecting-area gage\n(19-in. diameter) at LaRC, each of the recording gages at the transmitter and receiver sites\nwere adjusted to indicate tips or successive accumulations of approximately 0.25 mm (0.01\nin.) of rain. The gages located near the scattering volumes were adjusted to indicate successive\naccumulations of approximately 0.51 mm (0.02 in.) during phase II and 0.25 mm (0.01 in.)\nduring phase I. The nominal 0.25-mm-per-tip gages had a useful measurement range of between 5 and 100 to 200 mm/hr depending on the gage and the recording system used. The\nlower rate limit was set by the natural variability of rain and the long time interval between\ntips that occurs at low rain rates. The higher limit was set by gage calibration error and the\nrecording system. The gages located in the vicinity of the common volumes used a recording\nsystem with a chart speed of approximately 1 cm/hr. For these gages, the 1 -min averaged\nrate cannot be determined with precision above about 15 mm/hr primarily because of the 2to 3-min averaging time inherent in the reading process. The other gages used higher chart\nspeeds and were calibrated over a range of rain rates to provide better estimates of the higher\nrates. The 19-in. gage was used to extend the measured range down to about 1 mm/hr because\nit tipped more often at a given rain rate. The 1829-cm2 collecting area of the 19-in. gage was\nobtained by masking a portion of a larger 7316-cm2 collecting area (38 in.) on the gage. The\nlarger collection area was not used during the experiment.\n2.2.2.2 Gage Siting\nThe gages were located as shown in figure 2-1 either to provide a measurement in the\nvicinity of the scattering volume or to provide measurements in the experiment area at\n\nTable 2-5.\xe2\x80\x94Rain-Gage System Summary\nGage\nno.\n\nLocation\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n6\n7\n7\n8\n8\n9\n9\n10\n\nL\nL\nL\nE\nF\n5K\n5K\n10K\n10K\n20K\n20K\n30K\n30K\nT\n\n10\n\nT\n\nType"\n\nI, II\nII\nII\nII\nII\nI\nII\nI\nII\nI\nII\nI\nII\n9/1/70 to\n10/20/70\n10/21/70 to\n3/11/71\n\nCollecting area,\ncm2\n\nCalibration,\nmm/ tip\n\nCan\nI (19 in.)\nI (8 in.)\nI\nI\nII\nIII\nII\nIII\nII\nIII\nII\nIII\nII\n\nPhase or period\nof recording\n\n324\n1829\n324\n324\n324\n324\n159\n324\n159\n324 .\n159\n324\n159\n324\n\n0.08\n.27\n.29\n.29\n.25\n.51\n.25\n.51\n.25\n.51\n.25\n.51\n.25\n\n159\n\n.51\n\nIII\n\na\n\nThe type refers toCan = total accumulation measuring gage.\nI = tipping-bucket gage as used at the transmitter and receiver sites.\nII = tipping-bucket gage used in the vicinity of the common volumes of the bistatic radar system.\nHI = same gages as II with the collecting area reduced in size.\n\n23\n\nlocations that were operationally convenient. The gages used near the common volumes\neach had a battery-operated recording system, screens over the sampling orifice to protect\nagainst clogging, and a slow chart speed allowing up to 45 days unattended operation. The\nother gages required power for the recording system, used higher chart speeds, and were not\nequipped with screens to protect against clogging. These gages had to be inspected periodically and visited after each rain event to measure the total accumulation for each event\nstored in the catchment container. Because the sites were manned for each event during\nphase II, these gages were located at the sites.\nThe gages located at each of the transmitter and receiver sites were in open flat areas\nwith either grass or sparse scrubby growth of height less than gage top and no obstructions.\nAny object within 60\xc2\xb0 of the vertical above the gage might shield the gage under adverse\nwind conditions and is considered an obstacle. These obstacles can cause gage measurement\nerrors either by physically diverting the rain or by modifying the vertical component of the\nwind field and of the raindrop fall velocities at the gage. The former effect leads to a low\nestimate of rain rate and total accumulation; the latter effect may either increase or decrease\nthe measured rain rates. At the sites, the closest possible obstructions were either buildings\nor antennas. At LaRC the tops of the 30-ft antennas were greater than 57 m from the gage,\nhence the closest obstruction was more than 78\xc2\xb0 from zenith above the gage. At Eastville a\nbuilding was 21m from the gage with an angle of more than 75\xc2\xb0 from zenith. At Fort Lee\nthe closest possible obstruction was an antenna 12m from the gage that subtended an angle\nmore than 66\xc2\xb0 from zenith. The gages located in the vicinity of the common volumes did\nhave obstructions or other possible siting difficulties. The closest obstructions to the 5K\ngage were coniferous trees located approximately 5 m from the gage with heights of approximately 8 m. The trees provided shielding at zenith angles greater than 30\xc2\xb0 over an azimuth\nsector from 130\xc2\xb0 to 230\xc2\xb0. The 20K gage was located on level terrain near a soybean field\nwith a single deciduous tree about 5 m high at a distance 8 m from the gage. The tree provided shielding for zenith angles larger than about 60\xc2\xb0 at azimuths between 260\xc2\xb0 and 280\xc2\xb0\nand should be important only in extreme wind conditions. The 10K gage was sited on the\nroof of a two-story building within 10 m of the edge as shown in figure 2-8. Strong lowlevel winds may modify the vertical wind field above the gage causing errors in rate measurements. Each of the gages located beneath the common volumes had possible measurement\nerrors due to siting. The magnitude of these errors is estimated in section 4.\n2.2.2.3 Operating Procedures\nThe 5K, 10K, and 20K gages were generally left unattended. The gages were inspected\nonce every 6 weeks prior to January 1971 and every week thereafter; the charts were\nchanged every 6 weeks. The gages, although equipped for winter operation, were not used\nin this mode. As a result they were inoperable in snow or freezing rain and data for these\nevents were discarded.\nThe Eastville, Fort Lee, and LaRC gages were operated only during the phase II portion\nof the experiment. The rain-gage recording systems used with these gages employed chart\nspeeds of 45 in./hr and were designed for unattended operation over a relatively short time\n24\n\n10K RAIN GAGE\n\nFigure 2-8.-10K rain-gage siting.\n\nperiod. The recording systems were designed to turn themselves on with the first tip. A\n"turn on" indication was telemetered to the LaRC site to notify personnel that the gage was\noperating. The chart recorders had to be shut off manually. An operator was also required\nto measure the contents and empty the catchment container after each rain event. The collecting rain gage at LaRC was also read manually and emptied after each rain event. The\ngages were inspected daily in clear weather and calibrated periodically.\n2.2.3 Auxiliary Meteorological Systems\nIn addition to the primary radio and rain-gage systems used in the experiment, the\nfollowing auxiliary systems were used: surveillance radar; meteorographs; and NWS data\nincluding radar weather pictures (facsimile), rain-gage data, and radiosonde data. These are\ndescribed in the following sections.\n2.2.3.1 Surveillance Radar\nAn S-band surveillance radar (VERLORT) was located at the LaRC receiving site and\nwas dedicated to the experiment. Its primary purpose was storm tracking and propagation\nmechanism discrimination. It was equipped with both PPI and RHI displays, which were\nphotographed to provide sequential records of the progress of storms and of anomalous\npropagating situations (extended range, etc.). The radar was operated before, during, and\nafter precipitation scatter events and was capable of providing qualitative information on\nstorm reflectivity.\nA simplified block diagram of the radar is given in figure 2-9. As shown, the system\nused a magnetron transmitter, a pedestal-mounted antenna, and a low-noise traveling-wave25\n\nLOCAL\nOSCILLATOR\n\n1\n35-mm\nCAMERA\n\nREMOTE\n\nPPI\n\nr~ - - j \xe2\x80\x94\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nFILTER\n\nMIXER\n\n\'\n\ni.f.

For phase II, an operator-selectable\nstepped attenuator (HP-33300 programmable attenuator) was provided as an aid in\nthe estimation of cross-section intensity.\nThe characteristics of the radar are summarized in table 2-6.\nThe radar system was located in a separate equipment van approximately 100 ft\nfrom the receiving van. Communications\nbetween vans was via an intercom system.\n\n250-kWpeak, 100-W\naverage\n0.8 MS\n300 to 2000 pps\n\n2.2.3.2 NWS Weather Radar Data\n4dB\n3.0 MHz\n-106 dBmW (measured)\nPPI, RHI, and A-scope\n\nFacsimile recordings of a WSR-57 weather\nradar were received at the LaRC site and\nused for storm alerting and real-time storm\n\n26\n\ntracking. The pictures were transmitted continuously from the Patuxent River Naval Air\nStation located approximately 90 miles north of LaRC and were updated from time to time\ndepending on weather conditions. At the LaRC-site, the facsimile recorder picture update\ninterval was under operator control. During nonstorm periods updating was hourly; during\nstorm periods it was at least every 15 min and occasionally continuously.\n2.2.3.3 NWS Rain-Gage Data\nRain-gage data were obtained from the NWS for the first-order stations at Norfolk and\nRichmond and the second-order stations at Painter and Williamsburg. The data from these\ngages were used for two purposes. First, the occurrence of rain events and the amount of\naccumulated water were checked and compared with the data recorded by the experiment\nrain-gage network. This helped insure that all data were used in calculating the cumulative\ndistributions. Second, the rain-rate statistics were calculated for the Norfolk gage data and\nwere compared with the radio and rain statistics obtained by the measurement systems.\nThese distributions are given in reference 13. In addition to these stations, data were\nexamined from 22 other stations located within 100 km of LaRC as a further check on the\nrecorded data.\n2.2.3.4 Meteorographs\nThree meteorographs, capable of measuring temperature, pressure, and relative humidity,\nwere located at LaRC, Fort Lee, and Eastville. A fourth unit was provided for backup purposes. The units were of the continuously recording type and were inspected, calibrated,\nand had their charts replaced weekly.\n2.2.3.5 NWS Radiosondes\nRadiosonde data were obtained from the NWS stations of Dulles, Wallops Island,\nGreensboro, N. C., and Cape Hatteras, N. C. These data were analyzed to obtain upper air\ntemperature for use in estimating the height of the freezing level.\n2.2.4 GC Path System\nDuring the latter part of phase I, a second S-band antenna/receiver system was installed\nat LaRC to monitor signals arriving along the GC paths. The received signals were used to\naid in separating mechanisms and, during periods of high received-signal strength, the frequency (at i.f.) was measured as a check on the transmitter frequency.\nThe system was made up of three horn antennas, each having a gain of 19 dBi, pointing\nto Eastville, Fort Lee, arid Quantico, which were alternately switched to the receiver. The\nreceiver was identical to the one used in the bistatic radar system. The signals were recorded\non strip chart and magnetic tape.\n\n27\n\nA detailed description of the GC path system is given in section 3.3. The operating\nprocedures for the GC path system were identical to those of the bistatic radar given in\nsection 2.2.1.4.\n2.3 DATA PROCESSING\nThe data obtained from the bistatic radar system and the rain gages were recorded on\nstrip charts and, in the case of the bistatic radar system, on analog magnetic tapes. The\nrecorded data were read and processed preparatory to analysis in several ways. For phases\nIb and II the bistatic radar data were hand-scaled from the strip charts (Z-fold) and manually\naveraged to provide estimates of the 1-min average of the received-signal level. The bistatic\nradar data for phase la were automatically processed using analog-to-digital conversion\nequipment and computer sorting to provide estimates of the 1-min-median received-signal\nlevel. The rain\'gage charts were read by hand-scaling the time of each tip, keypunching the\ntip times for each event, and using a computer to calculate the average rain rate between tips.\nData from the auxiliary meteorological sources were obtained in a form ready for analysis.\nA summary of the data sources and processing techniques is given in table 2-1.\nThe bistatic radar and rain-gage systems were operated continuously. During most of\nthe time the chart records were blank. The gages tipped only when it rained. The bistatic\nradar system was configured so that during periods with no rain, with the exception of the\nGC path from Eastville to LaRC, no signals were recorded. Signals were often received\nfrom Eastville over the GC path by terrain diffraction enhanced by superrefraction conditions\nover the large expanse of water between Eastville and LaRC. The terrain-diffracted signals\nwere not processed. The chart records for both the bistatic radar system and the rain-gage\nsystem were edited or examined for an indication of scattering due to rain or rain measured\nat the surface prior to processing. On the primary measurement paths (10K and 20K, Eastville and Fort Lee), all occurrences of measurable signals were associated with rain events.\nOnly data corresponding to rain events were read either manually or using the analog-todigital converter and computer system. The editing process was accomplished by tabulating\nhourly summaries for each hour of the measurement year. This involved choosing the highest\nof three levels (thresholds) exceeded by a signal recorded in that hour. The threshold levels\nwere chosen so that level 1 approximately corresponded to an averaged signal level equal to\nreceiver noise. Level 2 corresponded to a 10-dB signal-to-noise ratio, which approximates\nthe interference threshold for an S-band Earth terminal receiver system. Level 3 corresponded\nto a - 115-dBmW value, which approximates the minimum useful signal leve-l\'for measurement. The existence of gage tips and equipment status were also tabulated for each hour of\nthe measurement year. The tabulations or hourly summaries were prepared for the gages\nand for the GC, 1 OK, and 20K bistatic scatter paths from Eastville and Fort Lee to LaRC.\nThe hourly summaries were used to generate a rain-event list. All occurrences of a\nreceived signal not obviously due to scatter from an aircraft (a very short duration signal\nlasting for less than 1 min) with a 1-min averaged value that exceeded threshold level 2 or 3\nand all occurrences of a measured rain rate at the 5K, 10K, or 20K gages in excess of\n1 mm/hr were used to establish events. Generally both gage and bistatic radar measurements\n28\n\nwere obtained during an event. The duration of an event was taken as the number of successive hours the event threshold was exceeded. For events consisting of light rain with\noccasional event indications, the duration of the event was increased to span all the hours\nbetween the first and last hour the threshold was exceeded. If the intervals between event\nindications exceeded 6 hr, the event indications were assigned different event numbers or\nconsidered as belonging to different events. For the measurement year, 119 rain events\nwere identified spanning a total of 898 hr.\nData processing techniques and processing precision are considered in section 5. The\ndescription of processing given there is through the stage of determining the 1-min-average\nreceived-signal level or rain-rate values. The final step of constructing the cumulative distributions is described in reference 13 because additional correction must be made to adjust for\nthe effect of signal level fluctuations. Only bistatic radar received-signal level data above a\nthreshold value of -115 dBmW were processed and tabulated for use in constructing the\nfinal cumulative distributions. The -115-dBmW threshold was chosen because the receiver\ncharacteristics were not logarithmic below that threshold level and correction estimates based\nupon an analysis of the statistical fluctuations in the received signal (considered in ref. 13)\nwere incorrect below that level. Below -115 dBmW the reading inaccuracies due to scale\ncompression also became large.\n2.4 DISCUSSION OF ERRORS\nThe accuracy, repeatability, and precision estimates given in this report refer to the behavior of the components of the system. When these component estimates are combined,\nthey represent only a part of the possible sources of error in the estimation of equivalent\nreflectivity. Scatter by rain must be viewed as a statistical process, the scattered signal a\nrandom variable, and the components of the bistatic radar system as devices that modify the\nstatistical properties of the random signal. The errors involved in the estimation of the\nparameters of the random process such as Doppler spread are given in reference 13. Angular\nerrors in antenna alinement are described in section 3.1.4 of this report. The errors in the\nmeasurement of equivalent reflectivity caused by antenna misalinement and the resultant\nchange of the scattering volume parameters are considered in reference 13.\nAccuracy as used in this report refers to the possible difference between the median\nvalue of all the equivalent reflectivity measurements or transmission loss measurements made\nduring the particular time period and the true median value measured with an ideal bistatic\nradar. The accuracy values given in sections 3 and 4 are estimated from the results of\nperiodic calibration measurements, the variations of critical parameters as noted in the site\nlogs throughout the year, and the manufacturers\' specifications on the performance of the\ntest equipment used. The measurement accuracy as quoted is a theoretical estimate because\nit cannot be measured. The accuracy estimates as given for each of the measurement systems\nare maximum values obtained by adding the individual accuracy estimates for each of the\nsystem components.\nRepeatability as used in this report refers to the possible difference between the median\nvalue of all the equivalent reflectivity or transmission loss measurements made during a\n29\n\nsingle rain event and the true median value for that event that may occur in addition to the\ndifference accounted for by the accuracy estimate. The repeatability refers mainly to slow\nchanges or drifts in the components due to, for example, temperature changes that have been\ncompensated for, on average, but that may affect the accuracy of measurements of a single\nevent. The repeatability estimates given in sections 3 and 4 were obtained from the measured variations in parameters observed periodically throughout the year or from measured\nsensitivities of components to changes in parameters such as temperature or voltage level\nsettings and the variations in the parameters as noted in the site logs. The repeatability\nestimates for each system component are reported as maximum values. The estimates for\nparticular measurement systems are obtained from the square root of the sum of the squares\nof the individual component estimates.\nPrecision is defined as the difference between a single 1 -min averaged value of reflectivity and the true value for that minute that may occur in addition to the differences accounted\nfor by the accuracy and repeatability estimates. Precision as used in this report refers to the\npossible errors involved in a single 1-min measurement due to the data processing or chart\nreading process. Accuracy or repeatability estimates for the data processing are not given\nbecause they depend on the precision of the reading process, the way in which the measurements are combined, and the number of measurements to be combined. This is considered\nin reference 13.\nA goal of this experiment is the construction of the measured cumulative distribution of\nequivalent reflectivity for a complete year. The purpose in constructing the measured distribution is to provide an estimate of actual temporal distribution of equivalent reflectivity for\na single location for use in rain interference prediction and comparison with distribution\nestimates obtained in other ways. A discussion of the possible differences between the 1-yr\nmeasured distribution and the true temporal distribution is given in reference 13.\n2.5 OPERATION SUMMARY\nThe operating summaries displaying the number of hours of the measurement year that\ndata were obtained, that the systems were inoperable, and that data were lost because of\nsystem failure are given in tables 2-7 to 2-9. Table 2-7 shows the number of hours during\nwhich the threshold was exceeded for at least 1 min. The event duration refers to the total\nduration of each event as described in section 2.3. The summaries show that significantly\nmore hours of scattering were detected from the 10K scatter volume than from 20K and\nthat the number of hours of scattering from the 1 OK volume was higher than the number of\nhours of rain-rate measurement on the surface. The thresholds for recording data occurrences\ncorrespond to S/N = 10 dB on the bistatic system (level 2 ~1 mm/hr) and 1 to 2 mm/hr on\nthe rain-gage system. The operating summaries are given only for the gages and primary\npaths used throughout the year and for the GO paths that supplied additional information\non other propagation mechanisms. The operation of the other paths is discussed in reference 14.\nThe GC path performance, summarized in the tables, is for reception via the sidelobes\nof the 30-ft antenna. The occurrences on the Fort Lee-GC path are associated with rain\n30\n\n"to "c\n\no s>\n\nH S\n\n2 -o\n: o\n3 \'C\n\nduration\n\nof hours\n\nj<\n\n\\or~-t--r~ sor~r-r--r~-r\xe2\x80\x94\n\nsgs\nr-i CN cs\n\nr-r-\n\n\xc2\xbb\xc2\xbb\xc2\xbb8Ri^8RN\n\ni\n<U\nc \xe2\x80\xa2*-\xe2\x80\xa2\no \'\xc2\xa7\n\nr - ^ - o o w ^ r o v o ^ ^ ^ N * \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xbb o o o o r * o o\n\nOO\n\n\\o 10 r-\n\n00\n\nO\n\nOs\noo\n\nIO OS ^~\nCJ fO Ol\n\nt-\n\n10 OS tN\n\nCJ Q,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\nc\n\no\n\nC/5\n\n<u\na.\n\no\n\nO\n\nfi\n\n1\noo\n\noo ""^ ^J1 **o ^f c^ r*^! c*J ^<o ^o ^f ^^ 0*1os \xe2\x80\x94 r-\n\nrts\nfN\nO\n\n^H\n\n^f\n\nCO C^l CO ^t*\n\nO^ C^ ^O ON ^\xc2\xbbf *^ *^i\n\n^i\n\nf"^\n\nOS (N ^\n\n^55?!^\n\nso\n\nOS\n\nOS\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 10 O O \xe2\x80\x94 00\n\nc-3 o\n\nfN\n\nU\n\noo oo T)- m os 10\n\noo Os\n\xe2\x80\x94 SO\n\noo\n\n^\n\no oo rs r\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\xa2* ro\n\ndi\n\n<O\n\n"i\n3\n\n<u\na.\nH\n\n2:\nui\n03\n\nS\nF\non\n\nUH\n\n00\n\nS\no\n\no\n\n<D\n\nU\n\no\n\no\n\nn,\nU\nl_\nr-\n\nU\n\no\n-a\nUi\n\na,\n\nI\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n(N\n\n<N (N\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nfN\n\nr-\n\nO\n\nS\n\nO to >o\n\noo\n\n^O ON co\nt""** ^f ^*\n\noo\nso\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nfN OS\n\n(N\n\n(N\n\nH\n\n^~* C^l C^l *~H\n\nC*4 CO\n\nc\n\nUi\n\n(U\n\nfN\n\nIO\n\n<*o\n\n3\n\nO fN (N\nOO O 00\n\nI-H ro *\xe2\x80\x94\'\n\n0\nfN\n\nCS\n\n0\n\n------------|\n\n1 \xe2\x80\x94 i\n\n| CN | O\n\nfN\n\n\xe2\x80\x941\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n|f-l|\n\n-H\n\nfN\n\nS\n\nO s l O l O j\n\na\n\n| < N | | fN r- \xe2\x80\x94 CN r- r~- ~^ to f*>\n\xe2\x80\x94 00\n\nSRS55a=SK\xc2\xabSS2\n\nr*") ^f fN\nro so .ro\n\nOs\n\n\xc2\xabK2\xc2\xabS8R35SS8-\n\nro O fN\nt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\xa2 m 10\n\nIO\n\n<L>\n\nrt\n\no\no\n\ntU\n\n||\n\n-< \xe2\x80\x94i r-) (N \xe2\x80\x94i\n\n_0\nO\n\nCO\n\nO\n\nS\n\nfN I\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\xa2 tN r-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2a\n\'^\n\nantenn;\n\n0\n\n1 c^ fN co\n\nON r^* ^f\n\ncd\n\n\xe2\x80\xa24\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xab\n\n\xc2\xa32\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2"\xe2\x80\xa2* ^"\n\n\'.M\n\n0\n\nS 2 3 S S S \xc2\xab g 3 s S S - SO\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nso \xe2\x80\x94\n\nO\n\nlo\nfN\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\'\n\nrt\n\xe2\x80\xa2O\n\no\n\nrt -O \xe2\x80\x94 ,\n\n3 C\nC/l\n\n&\nQ- 0.

Significantly more data were\nobserved on the GC path from Eastville. Less than 10 percent of these data, however, were\nassociated with rain events, the bulk of the data being associated with superrefraction conditions over the large expanses of water between Eastville and Langley. During these conditions, strong stable signals were observed that were monitored to determine the frequency\nof the GC and 20K source at Eastville.\nThe major system changes that occurred throughout the measurement year have been\ndiscussed previously and are detailed later in the bistatic radar and rain-gage system description sections. The changes were instituted to increase the accuracy of estimation of the\ncumulative distribution of equivalent reflectivity. The changes were of two types, one to\nmodify the switching sequences so the paths of interest were continuously sampled rather\nthan sampled for 1 min out of 4. The second type was to increase system reliability. Operating reliability was increased by eliminating switching for the 10K paths; by providing\nredundant transmitter facilities at each site, standby recording systems at the receiver site,\nand simplified operations; and by manning all the sites during events. The 10K path was\nconsidered the highest priority path and automatic transmitter switching was provided to\nmaintain operation on the 10K path if a transmitter failure occurred. Emergency power was\nprovided at each site to protect against power failure. Automatic switchover to emergency\npower was provided at the transmitter sites. Both the power supply and transmitter backup\nswitching systems at Eastville had to be used during two major rain events.

Only involuntary\noutages are shown. The transmitter and receiver subsystems were periodically removed from\noperation for testing and maintenance. This was done when observations and forecasts\nindicated that rain would not occur. The outages indicated in table 2-8 for phase I were predominantly caused by transmitter failures. The significant loss of data for the Eastville 1 OK\npath indicated in table 2-9 is due to a varactor multiplier failure that took 2 weeks to fix.\nThe outages that occurred during phase II were predominantly receiver site malfunction.\nThe data lost in phase Ib occurred because of strip chart recorder failure. These data are\nstored on magnetic tape and are recoverable. The rain-gage and radar data indicate that the\nrains were very light and therefore are not expected to cause scattered signals higher than\n-115 dBmW. Recovery of the dat^ has not been attempted because they do not contribute\nto the final cumulative distributions. The bistatic radar system and LaRC and Fort Lee\nrain-gage outages logged in table 2-8 for July were caused by loss of power at the receiver\nsite. All but 4 hr of the outage were caused by a planned power shutdown at LaRC. During\nthis time emergency power was available from the engine generator. It was not used because rain was neither observed nor forecast. The 2-hr loss of data logged for July in table\n2-9 occurred later in the month and was caused by a failure in the connector supplying\npower to the receiver trailer. This occurred during a thundershower that provided one of the\nmajor events of the year.\nThe operating performance of the rain gages is also shown in tables 2-7 to 2-9. Two of\nthe gages, the 30K and tower gages, had unreliable recording systems and were neither used\nin the tabulations of system performance nor as a source of data. The 1 OK gage lost data\neither because of snow or gage malfunction. The 20K gage lost data because of recorder\nsystem malfunction in December and January, snow, and misplacement of the April recorder\nchart prior to data processing. The 5K gage lost data because of snow and recorder malfunction. The site gages lost data either because of power failures at LaRC, misplaced charts\nprior to processing, or an obstruction in the funnel (Fort Lee, 2 hr in June). Except for the\n42 hr of data lost because of snow events, at least one of the common volume gages and one\nof the site gages were functioning for each rain event.\nThe experiment operations may be summarized using data from tables 2-7 to 2-9. Rain\nevents occurred during 898 hr or 10.2 percent of the hours of the measurement year. Rain\nscatter from the 1 OK common volume (using paths from either Eastville or Fort Lee) was\ndetected for 568 hr or 6.5 percent of the hours of the measurement year and from the 20K\nvolume 128 hr or 1.5 percent of the time. System reliability for each of the 10K and 20K\npaths taken over the entire year ranged from 93.6 to 97.8 percent. Reliability for the common volume rain gages taken over the entire year ranged from 73.0 to 95.6 percent. Because of path redundancy, the overall bistatic radar system reliability was 98.5 percent for\nthe measurement year (table 1-1). During rain events, the bistatic radar system reliability\n34\n\nwas 99.2 percent. Because of the use of several gages, the overall rain-gage system reliability\nwas 99.5 percent for the entire year and 95.3 percent during rain events. The loss of reliability in the rain gages was entirely the result of the occurrence of snow or freezing rain.\n3 BISTATIC RADAR SYSTEM\nThis section describes the equipment used during phases I and II. It includes the bistatic\ntransmit and receive system, the calibration and monitoring systems, the GC path reference\nsystem, a configuration history, and equipment error analysis.\n3.1 BISTATIC TRANSMIT SYSTEM\nThe major items making up the transmit system included a standard frequency oscillator,\nan rf source, a power amplifier and leveling loop, an rf switching matrix, and one or more\nantennas. A block diagram of the Fort Lee transmitter used during phase II is shown in\nfigure 3-1. The installation at Eastville was essentially identical except for operating frequencies given in table 3-1. The differences in the equipment configurations used in phases I and\nII are listed in table 3-2. The antenna switching sequences used in each phase of the experiment are shown in table 3-3. As can be seen in figure 3-1 for phase II, the site used two\ntransmitters, identical except for operating frequency. One transmitter (F2) illuminated the\n10K common volume intersection on a continuous basis while the other (F3) was switched\nbetween the GC and 20K antennas. Both transmitters used a single standard frequency\noscillator as the basic frequency source.\n3.1.1 Radiofrequency Source\nThe output of the standard oscillator, at 5 MHz, was applied to the frequency source\nwhich consisted of a frequency synthesizer (single frequency), a varactor multiplier, and a\nvariable attenuator. In the synthesizer the standard oscillator frequency was translated to\n102.0 MHz using frequency division, multiplication, and heterodyning techniques. Its power\noutput was approximately 10 dBmW. The synthesizer output was routed to a varactor\nmultiplier (X36 for S-band and X80 for X-band) for multiplication to the final operating\nfrequency. The output of the varactor multiplier, at a level of approximately 15 dBmW,\nwas then applied to the power amplifier and leveling section through a variable attenuator\n(used for level set and calibration purposes).\n3.1.2 Power Amplifier and Leveling Loop\nThe rf signal input from the frequency source was applied to the traveling-wave-tube\namplifier (TWTA) through the pin-diode modulator and a 10-dB pad. The pad was provided\nto eliminate the possibility of overdriving the TWTA during turn-on. In the case of the F3\ntransmitter, the input power level and the TWTA gain were too low to permit the use of the\n10-dB pad. The TWTA had a maximum gain of 40 dB and a maximum power output of 20\nW. It was operated near saturation with a gain of approximately 37 dB and a power output\nof 10 W. The isolator was included to provide a constant load impedance for the TWTA.

A dc voltage was obtained\nfrom the output of the power meter which was proportional to the loop rf output. This dc\nsignal was then amplified and used to control the pin-diode modulator level (variable attenuator) to hold the output of the transmitter constant at 10 W.\n3.1.3 Switching Matrix\nThe rf output from the power amplifier and leveling loop was routed to the switching\nmatrix through a directional coupler used for monitoring, calibration, and recording purposes.\nThe switching matrix was designed to switch or connect the transmitter to the appropriate\n\n39\n\nTable 3-2.\xe2\x80\x94Equipment Configuration for Phases I and II\nQuantity at site (unless otherwise noted)\nSystem and equipment\n\nPhase II\n\nPhase I\nE\n\nBistatic radio system:\nTransmit system:\nTotal antennas (= paths)\nS-band antennas (10 ft)\nS-band transmitters\nX-band antennas (6 ft)\nX-band transmitters\n10K transmitter backup\n10K antenna switching\nEmergency power units\nVoltage regulation\nRecording equipment\nAntenna switch timing control\nReceive system (at LaRC):\nDiplexer\nReceivers\nReceiver temperature stabilization\nCalibration systems\nCalibration standard\nReceiver down time during calibration\nMagnetic tape recorder\nStrip chart recorder\nEvent recorder\nTemperature recorder\nStrip chart integration\nPrimary ac power backup\nGC path system\n\nF\n\nQ\n\n9\n5\n2\n4\n1\nNo\nYes\n2b\n1"\n1"\nLocal0\n\n6\n3\n1\n3\n1\nNo\nYes\nlb\nlb\nlb\nLocal0\n\n4\n1\n3\n1\nNo\nYes\nlb\nlb\nlb\nLocal0\n\n7\n\nN\n\n2\n2\n1\n\n3\n3\n2\n\n3\n3\n2a\n\nNo\nYes\nlb\n\nYes\nNo\n3\n2\n2\nLocal\n\nYes\nNo\n2\n1\n\n1"\nLocal0\n\nRemoved 5/27/71\nS- and X-bandd\nInstalled 4/7/71\nS- and X-bandd\nPin-diode attenuator\n15 min, 8 min after 2/24/71\n1\n1\nInstalled 2/6/71\nInstalled 4/7/71\nNone\nNone\nInstalled 2/5/71\n\nF\n\nE\n\n2\nLocal\n\nNone\nS-band\nYes\nS-band\nProgrammable\nattenuator\n2 min\n1 + 1 spare\n1+1 spare\n1\nDigital printer\n10K paths\nEngine\ngenerator6\n1\n\n"Used Norfolk S-band transmitter.\nb\nlnstalled in latter part of phase lb.\nControlled from LaRC via telemetry from Dec. 15, 1970, to Feb. 14,1971.\nd\nX-band removed Apr. 11, 1971.\n"Installed July 1, 1971.\n\nantenna and to a pad during automatic calibration.

The calibration switches were controlled from\nthe receiver site via the phone line telemetry system. Control was such that every 2 hr during\nreceiver calibration the output of the appropriate transmitter was switched into the 20-dB\npad to prevent possible interference at the receiver. A pad was used rather than a termination to provide an additional monitoring point. The antenna switch, located in the F3, GC20K system, was used to switch the F3 transmitter output to the GC or 20K antennas. The\ntiming for the GC-20K antenna switch was derived from the standard frequency oscillator\n(100-kHz output frequency). Stability of the standard oscillator was such that timing inaccuracies were negligible. When it was necessary to reset the timing (for example, after\ntransmitter tests), it was done manually under direction from the receiver site.\n3.1.4 Transmission Line and Antennas\nThe transmission lines used at S-band were either 50- or 100-ft lengths of foam-filled,\n7/8-iri., 50-fi, copper-conductor, coaxial cable. The voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) of\nthe cable was 1.3 or less. The measured insertion loss values are given in table 3-4 (and in\nlater tables) as changes from the nominal value listed in table 2-3. At X-band the transmission line used was a pressurized, air dielectric, elliptical waveguide (Andrews Corp. model\nEW-71).\nThe antennas, 6- and 10-ft parabolic dishes at X- and S-band, respectively, were of\nstandard design using rear-mounted buttonhook sectorial horn feeds guyed to the dish at\nfour points. The VSWR of the antennas was approximately 1.4 or less. Antenna pattern\nand gain measurements were made before the experiment on one 6-ft and one 10-ft antenna\n\n41\n\nTable 3-4.\xe2\x80\x94Transmitting Transmission Line Loss\nPath\n\nSite\n\nNo.\n\nDesignation\n\nTransmission line\n\nFrequency\nU~_ J\nDana\n\nLength,\nft\n\nAdditional loss\nwith respect to\nnominal values,3 dB\nMeasured\n\nE\n\nF\n\nQ\n\nN\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n\nGC\n5K\n10K\n20K\n30K\nGC\n5K\n10K\n30K\nGC\n10K\n20K\nGC\n10K\n20K\nGC\n20K\n30K\nOP\nGC\n20K\n30K\n10K\nOP\n\n100\n50\n50\n100\n50\n50\n50\n50\n50\n50\n50\n50\n50\n50\n50\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n50\n50\n\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nX\nX\nX\nX\nS\nS\nS\nX\nX\nX\nS\nS\nS\nS\nX\nX\nX\nS\nS\n\nEstimated\n\n1.1\n-0.7\n\n-.6\n1.1\n-.7\n.0\n.0\n.0\n.0\n.4\n-.7\n.5\n.0\n.0\n.0\n\n1.1\n1.1\n\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n-.7\n-.7\n\na\n\nNominal values are 4.4 dB at S-band and 3.6 dB at X-band and rtfer to the loss between the output of the power\namplifier and leveling loop section and the antenna.

All the S-band measured patterns were similar. The preexperiment patterns\nare given in figures 3-2 and 3-3 for S- and X-band, respectively. The measurements were\nmade at an outdoor antenna test range at LaRC by NASA personnel. The rotating mount\nhad to be strengthened and modified somewhat for this measurement because it had not been\ndesigned to handle 10-ft-aperture antennas. As a result of the modification, the center of\nrotation of the mount was offset somewhat from the radiating phase center of the antenna.\nThe measurement was made with an antenna separation of approximately D2 /\\ where D is\nthe dish diameter. The correction factor for gain measurements made at D2 /\\ was not included because the accuracy of the measurement was not sufficient to warrant it.

Postexperiment gain measurements for the 10K\nand 20K antennas were all within \xc2\xb10.2 dB of the nominal 38.8-dBi antenna gain and therefore the 38.1-dBi value is believed to be low. For system calculations the gain measurements\nmade upon completion of the experiment were used. The half-power beamwidth was 1.95\xc2\xb0\nin both E and H planes and the maximum sidelobe level was approximately 24 dB below the\npeak gain. For the X-band antenna, the gain was measured to be 40.7 dBi, the half-power\nbeamwidth = 1.6\xc2\xb0, and the maximum side level was approximately 21 dB below the peak\ngain.\nAt the conclusion of the experiment, in situ patterns, gains, and pointing angles were\nmeasured for the 10K and 20K antennas at Eastville and Fort Lee. The measurements\nwere made using a crane (cherrypicker) at distances of approximately D2 /A. The direct\ntransmission loss method of gain measurement was used by which the distance and relative\npower transmitted and received are measured and the gain is calculated. The substitution\nmethod could not be used because of multipath problems. The gain of each antenna was\nmeasured several times and the results averaged. The gain values for these four antennas are\nlisted in table 3-5. Although an attempt was made to measure the cross-polarized pattern,\nit could not be measured with the available equipment under field conditions.\nThe transmit antennas were initially alined to their prescribed pointing angles by\nmechanically positioning the plane of the rim of the antenna. The orientation of this plane\nwas established using surveying techniques referenced to the North Star azimuth (corrected\nvalue) and transit estimates of horizontal. An estimate of the accuracy of mechanically\nalining the antenna is \xc2\xb10.4\xc2\xb0. The feed horns were installed in accordance with the manufacturer\'s instructions. It is estimated that the difference in the electrical and mechanical\npointing angles (boresight offset) is \xc2\xb10.3\xc2\xb0. Therefore, the accuracy of the initial alinement\nvalues is \xc2\xb10.7\xc2\xb0. Electrical pointing angle measurements were made before realinement\n(April 30 to May 5, 1971) and after realinement (May 6, Eastville only) using the broadband\nradiated power probe (par. 3.5.3) and a transit. The accuracy of the measurements\nis estimated to be \xc2\xb10.5\xc2\xb0. Table 3-5 also lists the electrical pointing angle values obtained\nfrom the in situ measurements made at the end of the experiment. These measurements\nhave an estimated accuracy of \xc2\xb10.1\xc2\xb0. The broadband radiated power measurements made\nduring phase II indicated that the antenna pointing angles did not change between May 7\nand November 1, 1971. Periodic antenna pointing measurements were not made prior to\nApril 30, 1971. At the time of the April 30 measurements, it was noted that the Fort Lee\nantenna guys were taut and the Eastville guys were loose. It is expected that the Fort Lee\nantennas did not move prior to April 30 and that the differences between mechanical and\nelectrical pointing positions can be attributed solely to the installation and measurement\ntechnique. The Eastville antennas shifted position, necessitating realinement, and it is\nestimated that the antennas were pointed within 5\xc2\xb0 in azimuth and 1\xc2\xb0 in elevation of their\ninitial values.\n\n44\n\ns"\n\np\noo*\n<^\n\nAzimuth Elevation\n\n\xe2\x80\xa23\n\nO\n\nO\njj\nO)\n\n"ra\no\nC\nC3\n\n_\n\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2b\nO\n\n\\B"\n\nS\n\nm\n\nO\n\xe2\x80\xa2a\nCJ\n\nc\no\n00\n\no\n\xe2\x80\xa2a\n\nu\n\n.5\n\nIs\n\nO\nPH\n\n<u\n\n1\n\nc^\n<\n\nO\n\n<u\nE2\n\nalinement\n\n60\n\n13\na>\n\nAntenna p\n\nCO\n\nr^\nm\n\n|-5r\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 i\\\n\nKJ\nC\nC\n\n- 0\n\n0\n\n^5\n\n2" o\n\xc2\xa3 "-^ \xc2\xabn\nS\n\n1\n0\nrn\n\n^\n\n_u\n\nra\n\nH\n\n*S c\nca <D\n\n\xe2\x80\xa25\nj=\n\nC\n\n\'S\n\n1^\n\xc2\xa3 S g\n\xc2\xa7-\xc2\xb0\ni*i 1\ni.a i!\ns\nj?\n>\n<L>\n\n_e\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\na\n\nc/3\n\nr-; r-;\n06 oo\nrn ro\n\nvD ON\noo od\nfi ro\n\nin\nVn\n\n^O \xc2\xabN\nen vo\n\n\xe2\x80\x94; ^;\n(N ^*\n\n^H\n\n\xc2\xab\n\np NO\n\nro\nro\n\noi m\'\nm ^o\n\nCO\n\nP3\n\n>\n1>\n\n^- ^~\n^ oo\n\nCN i-j\n\nO\n\nCO ^d\n\no\n(N\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\n\nCO\n\np\n\nTf\n\n^\n\nr--\'\nm\n\n<N in\nm xo\n\n^\'\no\\\n\n(N\n\n(N CN\n\noot\nO\n\nro CN\nro -O\n\n^~^\n^\n\nc\\\nr-*\nro\n\nin oq\nCN in\nm so\n\n\xc2\xa3p\n5i^\n\nCS\n\n(N CN\n\n^ ^ P **!

The remote monitoring was accomplished using a telemetry\nsystem that transmitted tones over dedicated phone lines. The presence or absence of rf\npower at the input to each transmission line leading to an antenna was continuously monitored and recorded remotely at LaRC. By this means, one could tell if rf power was being\nfed to the antennas and if timing of the switching was correct. The use of the emergency\npower system was also remotely monitored. The power output of each 10K transmitter was\nmonitored and recorded locally on a continuous basis on strip chart recorders.\nDuring phase II, the reflected rf power, the ac and dc voltages, and the minimum and\nmaximum van temperatures were measured daily and before and after an event. The antenna\nguy cable tension, the power radiated from the dish antennas, and the constancy of antenna\npointing angle were monitored every 2 weeks. The latter measurement is described in detail\nin section 3.5. No significant changes in antenna pointing or radiated power were observed\nduring this period.\nDuring phase I, the following parameters were measured on a weekly basis: rf loop\npower, rf power out of the 20-dB pad monitoring point, dc and ac voltages, and minimum\nand maximum van temperatures.\n3.1.6 Installation\nFigures 3-4 and 3-5 are photographs of the Eastville and Fort Lee sites, respectively.\nAll antennas, except those at Quantico, were mounted on 6.6-in.-diameter steel pipes with\ndish centers approximately 14 ft above ground level. The masts were approximately 21 ft\nhigh and were guyed at four points. The guys to the sides and to the rear were of steel\nwhereas the one to the front was of Dacron to minimize aperture blockage effects. The\n\n,X-BAND ANTENNAS\n\nS-BAND ANTENNAS\n\nFigure 3-4.-Eastville transmitter site.\n\n46\n\nS-BAND ANTENNAS\n\nFigure 3-5.\xe2\x80\x94Fort Lee transmitter site.\n\nmasts were bolted to crossed 6-ft-long by 15-in.-wide C-channel members that formed the\nbase of the mounting structure. The base rested on the ground and was held in place by the\nweight of the antenna and structure and the downward force component from the guys. If\nthe guys became loose through buffeting by the wind, settling, or aging of the Dacron guy,\nthe structure was free to move. This apparently happened at Eastville sometime prior to\nApril 30, 1971, necessitating antenna realinement. Consequently, both the guy tension and\nantenna pointing angle monitoring procedures (wideband radiated power) were required.\nAt Quantico the antennas were mounted on an existing free-standing tower at heights of\napproximately 70 ft above the ground. All antennas were adjustable in elevation angle by\nmeans of a threaded rod and in azimuth by loosening several bolts.\nThe transmitting equipment was housed in portable camper-type trailers (vans), which\nprovided weather protection; the vans were equipped with air conditioning and heating for\ntemperature control. A thermometer was provided, which indicated the minimum and maximum temperatures reached inside the van. Commercial power was normally used; however, an\nemergency power unit with near-instantaneous switchover capability was provided that picked\nup the load when primary power was lost. Voltage regulators were also provided to insure constant voltage to the transmitter components under all conditions.\n\n3.2 BISTATIC RECEIVING SYSTEM (30-FT DISH RECEIVER)\nThe bistatic receiving system consisted of an antenna, rf, if., detection, and data recording and display sections. The receiver used a single stage of conversion and was assembled,\nfor the most part, from commercially available parts.\n\n47\n\n3.2.1 Antenna\nThe receiving antenna was a 30-ft parabolic dish with a dual-frequency prime focus feed\nhorn (S- and X-band) alined for vertical polarization. Antenna pattern and gain measurements were made at S- and X-band before the experiment and at S-band after the experiment.\nThe before and after S-band measurements were identical to within measurement error and\nare given along with the X-band results in figures 3-6 and 3-7. The measured gain of the\nantenna at X-band was approximately 4 dB low and the measured half-power beamwidth\nwas approximately 1.4 times broader than expected for a 30-ft antenna. The departure of\nthe X-band parameters from the expected values may be due to the compromise in feedhorn design needed to achieve simultaneous operation at S- and X-band, defocusing, or\nmeasurement error. The measurements were made using a target transmitter with a horn\nradiator at the top of a tower (boresight tower) 8250 ft from the antenna, which is in the\nfar field (>2D2/X) at S-band and at approximately D2 /\\ at X-band. The gain was determined\nusing the direct transmission loss method where the distance, power transmitted, and power\nreceived are known (measured) and the gain calculated. The response of the receiving\nantenna to a cross-polarized field at S-band was checked. On the mainlobe axis the crosspolarized response was down approximately 40 dB relative to the principally polarized field.\nThe principal lobes of the cross-polarized pattern (as measured in the two planes located at\n\xc2\xb145\xc2\xb0 with respect to the E- or H-plane) were approximately -25 dB with respect to the\nmainlobe peak.\nAt S-band the approximate sidelobe level along the GC path toward Eastville was\n-50 dB with respect to the mainlobe peak. This value was obtained by comparing the levels\nreceived with that of the horn receiving system during periods of high signal strength\n(enhanced terrain diffraction) when both received signals tracked in detail. Sufficient data\nwere not obtained along the GC path toward Fort Lee to make a similar measurement.\nThe antenna pointing angles, as measured with respect to the known position of the\nboresight tower, are given in table 3-5. The antenna was maintained in this position for the\nfull experiment year.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nANGLE, deg\n\nFigure 3-6.-Receiving antenna pattern-S-band.\n\n48\n\nHolf-Power Btomwidth : 0.40\xc2\xb0\n\n_<VO-\n\n*\xe2\x80\x9e\n\nANGLE, deg\n\nFigure 3-7.\xe2\x80\x94Receiving antenna pattern\xe2\x80\x94X-band.\n\n3.2.2 Radiofrequency Section\nA block diagram of the bistatic receiving system used in phase II is shown in figure 3-8.\nDifferences in the phase I and II equipment are given in table 3-2. Incoming signals were\nrouted through the directional coupler (used for calibration) to a low-noise tunnel diode\npreamplifier (IDA). The IDA had a single sideband noise figure of 5 dB, gain of 20 dB, and\na bandwidth of approximately 400 MHz. After amplification, the signal was routed to the\nmixer stage. Because no image rejection filter was used between the TDA and the mixer, the\nresulting system noise figure was 8 dB. As indicated in figure 3-8, these components were\nmounted behind the antenna feed horn in a temperature-stabilized housing. The local\noscillator (LO) signal, which provided the second input to the mixer, was derived from a\nstandard frequency oscillator and a frequency synthesizer (single frequency). The synthesizer, which accepted a 1-MHz input signal, used frequency division, heterodyning, and\nmultiplication to convert the incoming signal to the desired frequency of 91.56 MHz. The\noutput of the synthesizer was then split into two parts (one for the bistatic receiver and the\nother for the GC path receiver) and routed through a pad and approximately 200 ft of\ncoaxial cable to an amplifier located in the antenna-mounted electronics housing. The pad\nwas used to achieve the proper drive level to the amplifier. After amplification (approximately 20 dB) the signal was routed through a varactor multiplier (X 40) and pad to the\nmixer assembly. The pad was used to obtain the LO power level of 1 to 2 mW required for\n\n49\n\nft\n*\'\n\nTHERMOCOUPLE\n\nDIGITAL\nTHERM\nOIGITEK\nSER.900S\n\nI\n|\n\nPRINTER\nDIGITEK\nSER. 858\n\nfc\n\n*\n\n[\n\ni\n\n"\n\n,r^H\n\xe2\x80\x9e 1,\n-*SBl\n\n*\n\nDIG\n\n*\n\nSCANNER\nSER.4360\n\nSen\n\n|\n\nOIGITEK 636 TEMP, ft CLOCK SYSTEM\n\n|\n\nHEATER.\nTHERMOSTAT\n11130041\n\n\xc2\xbbfl DISH\n\nsaw RES.\n\nG-48.0tfB\nDW . 0.7*\nSL--22d8\nNF - 54 dB\nBW XOO MHi\n*\xe2\x80\xa2*><*\n\nL - 0 IdB\nFEED HORN\n\nDIRECTIONAL\n\nITS\n\nNARDA 30*4 30\n\n7\nA\n\n-\n\nTDA\n\nA\n\nL . 3 (JB\n\n<7\nJ\n\nj(\n\nRHG 2-4/4KK\nA\n\n-flS dBmW\n\n\'-M\xc2\xabHi\n\nMIXER\n\nACT 3S7I VXD\n\n-30 dB\n\nBW: TSOkHi-HSMHi\nG - 10 (IB (1 dB COMP * +3 dSmW)\n\nNF \xe2\x80\xa2 7.5 dB\nBW \xe2\x80\xa2 3 MKt\nG\'3"B\n\nA\n\n-45 dBmW\n\nr\n\n^y^\n\nAflVEE 3O7\nA\n\n+7 d\n\n113 dBmW\n\nDYN fl. * Si dB\n\nMH\n\' * 9.6\ni\n\nL..rod8\n\now - 3 MHI\n\nL-.\xc2\xab\n\nLIMITED i.i.\n\nA/\n\n\xc2\xab;\xc2\xab\xc2\xab\n\nZU..XTAI.\n\n/\n\nFXR43D30B\n\nuooi.i."\xc2\xbb-L\n\nrrc\'17ise\'c!\n\nTOSTBIPCXABT\n\nMcCOY MSB\n\n5-WAY POWER\n\nECM-KHBB\n\nC \xe2\x80\xa2 IS MF\n\n(INTEGRATED)\n\n-JOdBmW\n\ni\xc2\xab2V\n\n"200ttRG-55\n\xc2\xbb2d8mW\n3.6624 GH!\n\nJ\n\nG-\xc2\xbbdB\n\nf*\n\nNOTE!\n\nVARACTOR\n\n6-dBCAD\nOMNl^ftCIHA\n\nDRIVER AMPL\nARVEE-307\n\nUULT\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-\n\nFHEO\n\nSOURCES * \'\n\n\'\n\nm\n\n*\n\n1\n*\n\n91.56 MHi\nft\n\'\'\n\nFS-30M (X40)\n* 1 10 dBmW\n\nL\n\n-\n\nFROM\nSTD.OSC.\n\n1 10 dBmW\n\n"7 "BmW\n\n- 10 dBmW\n\nBISTATlC RECEIVING SYSTEM 130-lt DISH)\n\nr\n\nU-MLifcKWI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 1 dBmW\n\nRECORDER\n\n\' \xc2\xb0 MHl\n\nLOFREQ\nsvNTH\nITS\n\n&<1BPAD\nTEXSCAN FP-50\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-.IDdHmW\n\nTO STRIP CHART\nPECOftDER\n\nI\n\nGREAT CIRCLE PATH HECEIV NO SYSTEM (HORNS)\n3.B634GHI\n\nOSM TRANSMISSION\nNOTE 3\n\nLINE * 6 in.\n\n91.56MHI\n\nVARACTO R\n\nOH(VER\n\nFS-30M (X*0)\n\n^\xe2\x80\x94\nSTD.

The unit had a noise figure of\napproximately 7 dB, gain of 32 dB (rf - i.f.), i.f. center frequency of 9.6 MHz, and bandwidth of 3 MHz.\n3.2.3 Intermediate Frequency and Postdetection Section\nThe 9.6-MHz i.f. output of the mixer-preamplifier was further amplified (approximately\n20 dB) and routed through 200 ft of coaxial cable to a five-way power splitter located in the\nequipment van. The power splitter was of the resistive type and had a loss of approximately\n20 dB. The output of the power splitter was routed to five narrowband crystal filters where\nall but the desired signal frequency was attenuated. The filters had a 3-dB bandwidth of\napproximately 2 kHz, a loss of 4 dB, and out-of-band signal rejection of greater than 60 dB.\nThe selected i.f. signals were then applied to the associated log i.f. amplifiers where the\nsignal was amplified and detected. The log i.f. units were similar to those used in radar applications and had a dynamic range of 60 dB with \xc2\xb11.5-dB linearity, an i.f. bandwidth of 3\nMHz, a gain of approximately 65 dB, and an output frequency of approximately dc to 1 MHz\nat a level of 2 V. The output signal, which was proportional to the logarithm of the received\nrf signal amplitude, was then routed through various filtering circuits (of 100 Hz or less) and\nrecorded on strip chart and analog magnetic tape recorders. The characteristics of the filters\nand recorders are described in later sections.\n3.2.4\n\nReceiver Characteristics\n\nA summary of the characteristics of the S- and X-band receiver systems was given in\ntable 2-3. The results of critical receiver subsystem measurements are given in the following\nparagraphs.\n3.2.4.1 Oscillator Stability\nMeasurements made of frequency variations during the year were on the order of tens\nof hertz. The largest offset observed was 22 Hz. This included transmitter offsets, which\nwere measured at the transmitter, as well as receiver offsets (during periods of enhanced\nterrain diffraction when the received signal was of large amplitude and not fading).\n3.2.4.2 Typical Passband Structure\nThe bandpass characteristics of all components of the receiver were broad compared\nto that of the i.f. crystal filter. Therefore, the passband structure of the system was basically\nthat of the i.f. filter. The frequency response of the F2 filter is shown in figure 3-9. The\ncenter frequency of the received signal was 9.60 MHz. As can be seen in the figure, a frequency offset of 10 or 20 Hz (measured frequency stability) would have little or no effect\non the received signal amplitude. The other filters had similar bandpass characteristics with\nvariations of less than \xc2\xb10.4 dB within 400 Hz of their center frequencies.\n\n53\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 WITH POWER DIVIDER\no FILTER ALONE (INSERTION\nLOSS = 3.5 dB)\n\nCENTER FREQUENCY = 9.6 MHz\n\n-1600 -1400\n\n-1200\n\n-1000\n\n-800\n\n-600\n\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nJ\n1400\n\nFREQUENCY, Hz\n\nFigure 3-9.\xe2\x80\x94F2 crystal filter frequency response.\n\n3.2.4.3 Receiver Transfer Function\nThe overall transfer function of the F2 receiver channel is shown in figure 3-10. It is a\nplot of the dc voltage out of the log amplifier-detector as a function of signal level at the\ninput to the TDA. As can be seen in the figure, the system is linear to within \xc2\xb11.0 dB over\na 50-dB range.\n3.2.4.4 Postdetection Filtering\nTwo types of postdetection filters were used: 74-Hz (3-dB bandwidth), low-pass and\n1.5-s RC time constant filters (integrators). As shown in figure 3-11, all bistatic receiver\nchannels recorded on magnetic tape were routed through the 74-Hz filters. Bistatic signals\nrecorded on the strip chart in phase I were not integrated. During phase II the 10K signals\nwere routed through the 1.5-s integrators prior to strip chart recording. In addition, the\nstrip chart recorder itself acted as a low-pass filter. Its frequency response is given in the\nfollowing section.\n54\n\n2.5\n\nMAXIMUM CALIBRATION SIGNAL: -65 dBmW-\n\n2.0\n\n>\nI-"\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nj\n-135\n\n-130\n\n-120\n\n-110\n\nEFFECTIVE DYNAMIC RANGE ~50 dB \xc2\xb1 (1.0 dB) I\nI\nI\nL\n-100\n-90\n-70\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-55\n\nINPUT POWER, dBmW\n\nFigure 3-10.\xe2\x80\x94F2 receiver transfer function.\n\n3.2.5 Data Recording and Display\nThe bistatic radio data and GC path data were recorded on 1-in., 14-channel, analog\nFM magnetic tape and on an eight-channel strip chart. The strip chart records were used for\ndisplay as well as data reduction purposes. A block diagram of the recording system, as configured in phase II, is shown in figure 3-11. The differences between the phase I and II\nconfigurations are given at the end of this section and in table 3-2. As can be seen in the\nfigure, all bistatic channels recorded on magnetic tape were routed through low-pass filters\nprior to recording. The characteristics of the filters (and integrators) were given previously.\nThe 74-Hz filters were used to limit the frequency band of the scattered signal to that of\nthe magnetic recorder. The system used FM recording for all channels at a center frequency\nof 600 Hz with frequency deviation of \xc2\xb140 percent. The linearity (best-fit line) over this\nrange was \xc2\xb11 percent. Second and third harmonic distortion was less than 1 percent. To\nachieve these characteristics the recording speed was 0.6 in./s and wow and flutter compensation was used. A new tape reel was required every 13 hr (2400-ft reels) and a total of\napproximately 795 reels were used during the experiment. The strip chart recorder was of\nthe pressurized ink variety and had two side marker (event) channels in addition to the\neight analog channels. Signals from the 10K common volumes were routed through RC\nintegrating filters prior to recording while data from the 20K paths and GC receiver were not.\nLow-gain dc amplifiers (HP-8820A) were used in each channel to achieve full-scale chart\ndeflections (50 divisions) for a received signal level of -65 dBmW. The frequency response\nas operated was dc to 150 Hz (3 dB down at 10 divisions), rise time was 3 ms (10 to 90 percent of final deflection) with 4 percent overshoot, linearity was \xc2\xb10.25 division, noise and\n\n55\n\nFROM EASTVILLE (VIA TELEMETRY):\n\nFROM FORT LEE (VIA TELEMETRY):\n\nrf POWER STATUS, EMERGENCY POWER\n\nUNIT STATUS; AND RAIN-GAGE STATUS\n\nEVENT\nX1"\nRECORDER\n(20 CHANNEL)\n\nrf POWER STATUS.

The side marker\nchannels were used to record local and Fort Lee timing. Timing for the recording systems\nwas from a time code generator that was driven by the standard frequency oscillator. The\nstandard oscillator provided 1.0-MHz pulses to the time code generator which produced a\n\n56\n\ntime code pattern in IRIG-E format. This format uses a 100-Hz carrier, a code frame length\nof 10 s, and indicates time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. This code was recorded on\nchannel 13 of the magnetic tape recorder.\nIn addition to the data recorders described above, a display panel, a 20-channel event\nrecorder, and a digital printer were used for diagnostic and display purposes. As indicated in\nfigure 3-11, the event recorder was used to indicate the status of equipment at Eastville,\nFort Lee, and LaRC. The following information was obtained via telemetry from Eastville\nand Fort Lee: rf power monitor status, rain-gage status, and the emergency power\nunit status. Also recorded were the status of the LaRC rain gages, LaRC site timing, and\nthe status of the horn antenna switches used in the GC path system. The digital printer\nrecorded the ambient temperature and also the temperature within the antenna-mounted\nelectronics housing as shown in figure 3.8.\nDuring phase I the spare strip chart and magnetic tape recorders shown in figure 3-11\nwere not available and the 1 OK strip chart paths were not integrated prior to recording. Also\nin phase I, the X-band channels were recorded and displayed on the strip chart. The event\nrecorder and digital printer were introduced in the latter part of phase I.\n3.2.6 Calibration System\nA block diagram of the calibration system used in phase II was given in figure 3-8. The\ndifferences between the phase I and II configurations are described at the end of this section\nand summarized in table 3-2. Calibration of the bistatic and GC receivers was fully automatic and occurred every 2 hr. Timing for the calibration was derived from the site standard\nfrequency oscillator. Approximately 1 min was required to calibrate each channel (frequency) of each receiver. When a particular channel was being calibrated, the corresponding\ntransmitter was turned off (routed to an attenuator) via the telemetry system to prevent\nthe possibility of interference. The automatic calibration signal level was controlled in 10dB steps over a 70-dB range, from - 135 to -65 dBmW, by the calibration timer and programmable attenuator.\nThe rf signals used for calibration were generated in the same manner as the transmitter\nfrequencies. A standard frequency oscillator was used to feed a frequency synthesizer which\nin turn fed a varactor multiplier. Because each frequency in the system was calibrated, the\nsynthesizer had a multifrequency capability. The frequencies of the calibration signals were\nwithin 22 Hz of the corresponding transmitter frequencies. The output of the varactor\nmultiplier was routed through a precision variable attenuator and a directional coupler to a\nthermistor and power meter. The precision attenuator served several purposes. It was used\n(1) in conjunction with the power meter for testing and resetting power levels when\nrequired, (2) periodically to check the programmable attenuator, and (3) to provide a finer\ngrained calibration than the 10-dB steps of the programmable attenuator. The other output\nof the directional coupler was routed through a 20-dB pad to the programmable attenuator\nwhich was used as the calibration standard in phase II. The programmable attenuator was\ncalibrated before and after phase II by the Calibration Laboratory of MIT Lincoln Laboratory\n\n57\n\nand was found to be within \xc2\xb10.2 dB over its full range in both accuracy and repeatability.\nThe output of the programmable attenuator was applied sequentially to each receiver via the\nreceiver select switch and directional couplers.\nIn phase I, an X-band calibration system was provided; a pin-diode attenuator of limited\naccuracy and repeatability was used as the calibration standard; and all channels were off\nduring calibration which lasted approximately 15 min.\n3.2.7 Monitoring Capabilities\nThe receiver parameters that were monitored in the summer months are given in the\nfollowing list. Some parameters were monitored before and after radio events and also on\na daily basis, whereas others were monitored periodically. Prior to the summer months many\nof these parameters were measured on an irregular basis.\n(1) Daily or preevent and postevent monitoring:\n(a)\n\nMinimum discernible signal level (cw using calibration system)\n\n(b)\n\nReceiver and calibration system stability\n\n(c) Calibration tone levels\n(d) dc power supply voltages\n(e)\n\nac line voltage\n\n(f)\n\nStrip chart recorder calibration\n\n(g) Minimum and maximum temperatures (van, outside, and antenna-mounted\nelectronics)\n(h) Telemetry system levels\n(2) Periodic monitoring:\n(a)\n\nSystem gain stability (temperature)\n\n(b)\n\nInsertion loss and VSWR of calibration system\n\n(c)\n\nReceiver bandwidth and transfer function\n\n(d) Mixer crystal currents\n(e) Frequency and spectra of calibration tones and LO signal\n(f)\n\nFrequency of the FM oscillators in the magnetic tape recorder\n\n3.2.8 Installation\nAs indicated in figure 3-8, the rf sections and first i.f. amplifier for the bistatic receiver\nwere mounted in a separate housing adjacent to the antenna feed horn. The housing was\nweatherproof and temperature stabilized. All equipment not mounted at the antenna was\n58\n\ninstalled in the equipment van. The van\nwas equipped with air conditioning and\nheating for temperature control. Commercial power was used. During the summer months an engine generator was\nprovided in case of power failure. Figures\n3-12 and 3-13 are photographs of the\nLaRC site.\n\nRECEIVER\nCFRONT END\n\n3.3 GC PATH SYSTEM\nA block diagram of the GC path system is shown in figure 3-8. The system\nFigure 3-12.\xe2\x80\x94Thirty-foot dish antenna, LaRC receiver\nsite.\nused three horn antennas, each having a\ngain of approximately 19 dBi mounted\non a tower approximately 27 ft above\nthe ground. The Eastville and Fort Lee\nHORN ANTENNAS\nhorn antennas were pointed at those\n(RECEIVERS)\nsites at an elevation angle of approximately 0\xc2\xb0; the Quantico horn was\npointed in the same direction as the 30-ft\ndish at an elevation angle of approximately\n10\xc2\xb0. The antennas were connected to\nthe receiver by two rf switches whose\ntiming was derived from the standard\noscillator. After the rf switches, the\nRECEIVER VAN\nreceived signals were routed to the\nmixer-preamplifier through the directional\nFigure 3-13.-LaRC receiver site.\ncoupler which was used for calibration\npurposes. The horn receiving system had\na 10-dB noise figure and was almost identical to that of the 30-ft dish except that a TDA\nwas not used and 20-dB additional i.f. gain was provided as compensation.\nThe recording equipment for this system as used in phase II is shown in figure 3-11.\nAs can be seen in the figure, the Fort Lee and Eastville GC path signals were recorded,\nunintegrated, on channels 8 and 7, respectively, of the strip chart recorder and filtered\n(74-Hz low pass) on tracks 9 and 5, respectively, of the magnetic tape recorder. For phase\nI, a single horn antenna was used directed at Eastville and the data were recorded on a\nsingle-channel strip chart.\n3.4 INSTRUMENTATION CHANGES AND EFFECTS\nAs described in earlier sections, the bistatic radar configuration was changed during the\ntransitional phase. In addition, measurements made on components and subsystems during\nthe year indicated that changes in performance had occurred. These changes are referred to\n59\n\nas "correction factors" and are used to modify the nominal values given in table 2-3. The\nfollowing categories were considered:\n(1) Attenuator incorrectly set in calibration system\n(2) Calibration standard system change\n(3) Transmission line loss variations\n(4) Transmitter spectrum differences\nThe specific changes, their effects, and the period over which the situation existed are summarized in chronological order in tables 3-6 to 3-9 for the Eastville and Fort Lee 1 OK and\n20K paths. Changes resulting in corrections of \xc2\xb10.1 dB or less are not included. The spectrum corrections were empirically derived using the calibration system as reference. The\nantenna gain and pointing angles differed from the values used for the path loss computations. Their changes are documented in section 3.1.4.\n\nTable 3-6.\xe2\x80\x94Eastville 10K Path Correction Factors\nPeriod\n10/3/70 to 5/17/71\n\n12/8/70 to 6/4/71\n\n4/5/71 to 10/2/71\n7/26/71 to 9/1/71\n\nChange or occurrence\nThe transmission line loss was less than the\nreference system because there was no directional coupler and fewer rf switches and\npower monitors in the path.\nAn attenuator (pin diode) with more loss than\nthat of the reference system was used in the\ncalibration system.\nThe setting of the precision attenuator in the\ncalibration system was in error.\nThe F4 and F5 transmitters were interchanged.\nSubsequent tests showed that the F4 transmitter had poorer spectral characteristics.\n\nCorrection\nfactor, dB\n\n-0.6\n\n-1.0\n\n-2.0\n1.7\n\nTable 3-7.-Fort Lee 10K Path Correction Factors\nPeriod\n10/3/70 to 10/2/71\n12/8/70 to 6/4/71\n\n4/5/71 to 10/2/71\n\nChange or occurrence\nThe transmission line loss was more than that\nof the reference system.\nAn attenuator (pin diode) with less loss than\nthat of the reference system was used in the\ncalibration system.\nThe setting of the precision attenuator in the\ncalibration system was in error.\n\n60\n\nCorrection\nfactor, dB\n\n+0.7\n-1.0\n\n-2.0\n\nTable 3-8r-Eastville 20K Path Correction Factors\nPeriod\n\nChange 01 occurrence\n\n10/3/70 to 8/1 5/71\n12/8/70 to 6/4/71\n\n4/6/70 to 10/2/71\n8/9/71 to 10/2/71\n\n8/16/71 to 10/2/71\n\nThe transmission line was twice as long (100 ft)\nas the reference system and had greater loss.\nAn attenuator (pin diode) with more loss than\nthe reference system was used in the calibration system.\nThe setting of the precision attenuator in the\ncalibration system was in error.\nThe Fl transmitter replaced the F5 transmitter\nduring this period; it had poorer spectral\ncharacteristics.\nA directional coupler was inserted into the\ntransmission path; its loss was 0.2 dB.\n\nCorrection\nfactor, dB\n1.1\n\n-1.0\n\n-2.0\n1.5\n\n1.3\n\nTable 3-9.-Fort Lee 20K Path Correction Factors\nPeriod\n10/3/70 to 8/10/71\n12/8/70 to 6/4/71\n\n4/6/71 to 10/2/71\n7/26/71 to 8/24/71\n(except for\n8/18/71)\n8/10/71 to 10/2/71\n8/18/71\n\n8/25/71 to 10/2/71\n\nChange or occurrence\nThe line loss was measured to be 0.5 dB above\nthat of the reference system.\nAn attenuator (pin diode) with more loss than\nthe reference system was used in the calibra. tion system.\nThe setting of a precision attenuator in the\ncalibration system was in error.\nThe F2 and F3 transmitters were interchanged;\nsubsequent tests showed that the F3 transmitter had poorer spectral characteristics.\nA directional coupler was inserted into the transmission path; its loss was 0.2 dB.\nThe frequency synthesizer voltage was missel;\nthis resulted in increased power at the desired\nfrequency.\nThe voltage on the varactor multiplier was\nchanged for improved spectrum.\n\nCorrection\nfactor, dB\n0.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-2.0\n3.0\n\n0.7\n1.8\n\n2.5\n\n3.5 EQUIPMENT ERROR ANALYSIS\nThis section describes the equipment errors as estimated for the bistatic radar system.\nThe tests and results that formed the basis for the estimates are discussed as well as the\ntransmitting antenna broadband radiated power tests made in phase II to insure that the\ntransmitting system parameters did not change. Angular errors in antenna alinement are\nconsidered in reference 13 based on measurements given in section 3.1.4. All test\n\n61\n\nequipment was calibrated, in accordance with the manufacturer\'s specifications, in the\nStandards and Calibration Laboratory at LaRC by qualified NASA or contractor personnel.\nThe basic measuring instruments used for measuring rf power were HP-432A power meters\nand HP-478A temperature-compensated thermistor mounts.\n3.5.1\n\nError Budget Summary\n\nTable 3-10 contains the values of measurement accuracy (ace.) and repeatability (rep.)\nfor the components used in the primary transmitting and receiving systems for phases I and\nII. The definition of measurement accuracy and repeatability as used in this report was\ngiven in section 2.4. As described there, system accuracy estimates are obtained by adding\ncomponent accuracy estimates, whereas repeatability estimates are obtained from the square\nroot of the sum of the squares of the individual component estimates. In general, the\naccuracy and repeatability values given for the period from October 3, 1970, to May 7, 1971,\nwere based on estimates; those covering May 7 to October 2, 1971, were based both on\nestimates and measurements. Table 3-10 is organized into three sections:\n(1) A listing of the errors associated with the equipment for each of the primary paths\n(2) A listing of the most accurate 1 OK and 20K paths for each phase selected by\nusing data from tables 3-11 and 3-12\n(3) The results of the wideband radiated power tests\nThese data are discussed in this section and in sections 3.5.2 and 3.5.3.\nThe most accurate 10K path for the year used the Eastville 10K path (F5) from October 3, 1970, through July 26, 1971, and the Fort Lee 10K path (F2) from July 26 through\nOctober 2, 1971. (See table 3-11.) For this combined 10K path, the errors were 4.0 and\n- 5.0 dB for phase I and \xc2\xb12.9 dB for phase II. Using a similar approach, the most accurate\n20K path had errors of 6.9 and -4.9 dB for phase I and \xc2\xb13.0 dB for phase II. The pin-diode\nerror summary is given in table 3-12.\nThe wideband antenna radiated power tests made during phase II indicated that (1) the\npointing angles of the antennas did not change; (2) the power received on each path as\naveraged over the 10 measurements for each path was within \xc2\xb10.5 dB of the calculated\nvalue; and (3) the variation of the individual measurements around the average was within\n\xc2\xb10.5 dB. These variations were well within the accuracy and repeatability of the measurements themselves and it was therefore concluded that the antenna gain and transmission\nline loss measurements were correct and did not vary during phase II.\n3.5.2 Supportive Data\n3.5.2.1 Transmitting Sites\nAs can be seen in table 3-10, the accuracy of the transmitting systems depended on the\nleveling loop, line losses, antenna gain, and transmitter spectrum.

Transmission line loss was measured several times during the\ncourse of the experiment. Based on the errors associated with these measurements, a value\nof \xc2\xb10.2 dB was believed to be an accurate estimate of error. The accuracy assigned to the\nantenna gain measurement was \xc2\xb10.5 dB and includes multipath effects, uncertainty of gain\nand pointing of the gain standard, and errors of the precision attenuator used in the measurement. The errors associated with the transmitter spectra were the largest source of transmitter error for many of the transmitters. The problem was that the spectral distribution\nof power was voltage sensitive and that this was not known until August 26, 1971. The\nvoltage was not accurately measured until August 9, 1971, at Fort Lee and August 18, 1971,\nat Eastville. Thus, in spite of the fact that the power output of the transmitters was held\nconstant, the power in the 2-kHz receiver bandwidth may have changed. The spectrum\nerrors for the different transmitters are given in table 3-11 and are described in the following paragraph.\n\n6.4\n\nThe spectra of the F2 and F5 transmitters were not voltage sensitive and very little\nerror was ascribed to them. The F3 transmitter output was quite voltage sensitive. Based\non measurements made using the maximum and minimum voltages recorded in site logs and\nnot knowing when the voltage sensitivity problem began, the error was estimated at +6 and\n-0 dB from October 3,1970, to July 26, 1971. From July 26 to August 26,1971, the voltage\nsensitivity problem was assumed to have existed and because the power supply voltages\nwere accurately measured from August 9 to October 2, 1971, the F3 errors could be corrected, resulting in improved measurement accuracy. The F4 transmitter was also frequency\nsensitive but not as much as F3. Based on information and measurements similar to those\ndescribed for F3, the error estimates were lower as shown in table 3-11. There was, however,\nsome uncertainty associated with the basic voltage sensitivity measurements and, because\nof this, an accuracy of \xc2\xb10.7 dB was used from July 26 to September 1. On September 1\nthe F5 transmitter, which was not voltage sensitive, was modified to produce F4 and was\nused for the remainder of the experiment. Because it was not voltage sensitive, the error\nassociated with it was \xc2\xb10.1 dB. The Fl transmitter, although quite voltage sensitive, had its\nvoltage controlled and monitored when it was used. The accuracy ascribed to it was \xc2\xb10.2 dB.\nThe total error estimate for the transmitters is given in table 3-10.\nTemperature and voltage drifts were the major source of repeatability errors. At the\ntransmitter sites, the thermistor mount which was part of the leveling loop was temperature\nsensitive. Based on observations and measurements of this effect, the repeatability estimates\nwere \xc2\xb10.4 dB in phase I and \xc2\xb10.2 dB in phase II. Transmission line loss variations due to\ntemperature changes are estimated at \xc2\xb10.3 dB based on empirical data. A value of \xc2\xb10.1 dB\nwas assigned to spectrum repeatability errors due to voltage uncertainty.\n3.5.2.2 Receiving System\nThe accuracy of the receiving system was a function of the antenna and calibration\nsystem errors (given in table 3-10). The antenna gain measurement required knowledge of\nthe loss of a transmission line system (calibration) containing many components (see fig.\n3-8) whose total loss was approximately 70 dB. Because the dynamic range of the measuring equipment used in the field was limited, the line loss was measured in sections and the\nresults summed. The accuracy estimate was \xc2\xb10.4 dB. The above line loss measurement was\nreferenced to a port of a directional coupler and an error of 0.1 dB is estimated for shifting\nthe reference point. The 30-ft antenna had a beamwidth of approximately 0.7\xc2\xb0, and an\nerror of \xc2\xb10.1 dB is ascribed to pointing it at the target transmitter. The pointing error\nestimate for the transmitting horn was \xc2\xb10.2 dB. This is somewhat higher than one might\nnormally estimate and was due to not using a boresight telescope for pointing. The pointing procedure involved using the strip chart recorder of the receiver to monitor transmission\nloss and relaying instructions for antenna movement, via radio, back to the boresight tower.\nAn error of \xc2\xb10.1 dB is assigned to the target transmitter stability, power meter drift, and\ntransfer of the wideband power reading to a narrowband calibration signal level reading required during the course of the gain measurement. Finally, an error of \xc2\xb10.6 dB was\nestimated for the gain of the transmitting gain standard and multipath effects due to\n\n65\n\ndiffraction by the trees in the foreground as described in section 2.2.1.1. Adding the\nindividual accuracy estimates results in a \xc2\xb11.5-dB accuracy for the gain measurement.\nIn the calibration system the major source of error during phase I was the pin-diode\nattenuator (HP-8733B) that was used as the calibration standard. This attenuator was a\nvoltage- and current-controlled analog device, which was driven from a regulated power\nsupply and a bank of dropping resistor networks. For accuracy it was calibrated against the\nprecision attenuator and adjusted periodically. This was done in early September 1970,\non December 8, 1970, and on January 24, 1971. The error estimates given in table 3-12 are\nbased on the drifts recorded at these times. On January 25, 1971, the regulated power supply was replaced and a daily calibration procedure was instituted. As a result of the\nrecorded calibrations over the period from January 25 to April 5, 1971, a - 1.0-dB correction factor was applied with an estimated error of \xc2\xb10.3 dB. The attenuator was calibrated\ninfrequently between April 5 and June 4, 1971, so that a \xc2\xb1 1.0-dB error estimate was used.\nIn phase II, a programmable stepped attenuator (HP-33300) was used. It was calibrated before and after the experiment and its accuracy and repeatability was \xc2\xb10.2 and \xc2\xb10.1 dB,\nrespectively. The other contribution to calibration system error was the frequency source.\nAlthough it varied \xc2\xb10.4 dB (repeatability) during the experiment, its accuracy was\nestimated to be 0.1 dB.\nThe major causes of large repeatability error values were temperature, voltage drifts,\nand (in phase I) a spurious oscillation in the i.f. amplification stages of the mixerpreamplifier assembly. Measurements and calculations indicated that the calibration transmission line loss variation was \xc2\xb10.8 dB and that it was due to temperature. The high value\nof pin-diode attenuator repeatability error was due to voltage variations. The receiver gain\nchange within the 2-hr calibration interval was caused by temperature variations and the\nspurious oscillation in the antenna-mounted electronics. The spurious oscillation was at\napproximately 500 kHz and of large amplitude. The harmonics of the oscillation varied in\namplitude and frequency with temperature. One of the harmonics often passed through the\nnarrow receiver passbands during periods of temperature change. When a harmonic of the\nspurious oscillation was present in the receiver output it typically had a slowly changing\namplitude with a peak value as high as -95 dBmW. The harmonic of the spurious oscillation\nadded to the signals being detected, thereby masking lower level signals. The spurious\noscillations were also sensitive to power supply voltage level such that changing the voltage\nlevel slightly shifted the frequency of the oscillation out of the narrow channel passband of\nthe receiver. The harmonics had a spacing different from the channel frequency separation\nand only one channel was affected at a time. In data processing, signals were always available from the other channels preventing a loss of data for a particular scattering height. The\nonset of spurious oscillations (or shift of frequency so it could be detected) was generally\naccompanied by a 2- to 3-dB change in receiver gain. This happened in a time interval that\nwas short in comparison with the time between calibrations, and the magnitude of the\neffect is given in table 3-10 as \xc2\xb13 dB. The mixer-preamplifier assembly was modified to stop\nthe spurious oscillation on April 19, 1971. Temperature stabilization for the antennamounted electronics was installed April 7, 1971. After the mixer-preamplifier modifications\n\n66\n\nand temperature stabilization the gain change between calibrations was reduced to \xc2\xb10.1 dB.\nThe spurious oscillations also caused mixing between the harmonics of the oscillations and\nthe signals to be measured resulting in high cross-talk between channels. Cross-talk levels\nas high as -20 dB with respect to the level in the primary channel were observed. Because\nthe spurious oscillation and the attendant mixing operation occurred in a wideband section\nof the i.f. amplifier chain, the calibration tones provide an adequate monitor for receiver\noperations and it is considered unlikely that a single narrowband channel would experience\na loss in gain.\n3.5.3 Broadband Radiated Power\nBroadband radiated power measurements were performed at both the Fort Lee and\nEastville transmitter sites from early May 1971 to the end of the program (October 2, 1971).\nThese measurements were made every 2 weeks and were obtained on the electrical axis of\neach antenna, to the right and left and above and below this axis. Plots of the measurements\nobtained on axis are given in figures 3-14 and 3-15 and for the 10K and 20K paths,\nrespectively. The purpose of these measurements was to insure that the antenna pointing\nangles and radiated power levels remained constant throughout the experiment. The constancy of antenna pointing angle was verified by comparing the on-axis data with the data\n\nT.O\n6.5\n\n6.0\n\n3:\nE\n\nUNCORRECTED AVERAGE = 6.5 \xc2\xb10.2 dBmW\nCALCULATED\nVALUE - 6.7dBmW\nMEASURING DISTANCE = 200 ft\n\nCO\'\nT3\n\nO\n\no\nCM\n\nF4\nLU\nO\n\nEASTVILLE\nUNCORRECTED AVERAGE \xc2\xab5.7 \xc2\xb10.5 dBmW\nCALCULATED VALUE = 6.2 dBmW\nMEASURING DISTANCE = 200 ft\n\nS2\n\nCO 6.0\n\n5.5\n\n5.0\n\n23\nMir\n\n30\n\n13\n\n20\nJUNE\n\nII\n\nIS\n\n18\nJULY\n\n22\n\n27\n\nAUGUST\n\nDATE\n\nFigure 3-14.\xe2\x80\x9410K antenna broadband radiated power measurements.\n\n67\n\n12\n19\nSEPTEMBER\n\n26\n\nUNCORRECTED AVERAGE = 8.6 \xc2\xb1 O.SdBmW\nCALCULATED VALUE = 9.1 d B m W\nMEASURING DISTANCE = 100 ft\n\nE\nm\n\ne>\nco\no\n\nFORT LEE\nUNCORRECTED AVERAGE = 7.4 \xc2\xb10.5 dBmW\nCALCULATED VALUE = 7.7 dBmW\nMEASURING DISTANCE 150 ft\n\no\nLU\n\nCC 8.O\n\n16\n\n\'\n\n23\nMAY\n\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n30\n\n\'\n\n6\n\n13\n2O\nJUNE\n\n\'\n\n27\n\n4\n\n\'\n\nII\n\n18\nJULY\n\n25\n\nDATE\n\nI\n\n8\n\n15\nAUGUST\n\n22\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n29\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n5\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n12 . 19\n26\nSEPTEMBER\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFigure 3-15.\xe2\x80\x9420K antenna broadband radiated power measurements.\n\nobtained off-axis, while constant radiated power was verified by comparing the on-axis\nreadings. It is concluded from these measurements that variations in radiated power levels\nduring the May 7 to September 30 interval were minor and that the pointing angles of the\nantennas remained unchanged during this interval.\nThe measurements were performed at distances between 100 and 200 ft using an\nantenna probe of 12.1-dBi gain, an HP-432A power meter, and an HP-478 thermistor mount.\nThese are broadband measurements, limited by the antenna bandwidth, probably of the\norder of 10 percent of the transmitter frequency.\n3.5.3.1 10K Antennas\nThe measurements were performed at a distance of 200 ft. The received power level\nfor this measurement, based on the parameters of the nominal system, is calculated to be\n6.2 dBmW (includes -0.8-dB quasi-near-field correction). Using the correction factors given\nin section 3.4, the calculated expected values are 6.7 and 6.2 dBmW, respectively, for the\nFort Lee and Eastville sites. Examination of figure 3-14 reveals that the measured average\nlevels at Fort Lee (6.5 \xc2\xb1 0.2 dBmW) and Eastville (5.7 \xc2\xb1 0.5 dBmW) show good agreement\nwith the expected values. The minor discrepancies can be attributed to the accuracy of the\nmeasurement, which is approximately \xc2\xb10.5 dB. This indicates good corroboration between\nthe wideband radiated power measurements and the measurements of transmission line loss\nand antenna gain.\n68\n\n3.5.3.2 20K Antennas\nThe measurements were performed at distances of 100 and 150 ft for Eastville and Fort\nLee, respectively. The received power level for this measurement, based on the parameters\nof the nominal system, is calculated to be 10.3 dBmW and 8.3 dBmW for Eastville and Fort\nLee, respectively. To obtain these figures, 2.7 and 1.2 dB were subtracted from the 10-ft\ndish antenna gain at Eastville and Fort Lee, respectively, because the measurements were\nnot made in the far field of the dish. Using the correction factors given in section 3.4, the\ncalculated expected values are 9.1 and 7.7 dBmW, respectively, for the Eastville and Fort\nLee sites. Examination of figure 3-15 reveals that the measured average levels at Eastville\n(8.6 \xc2\xb1 0.5 dBmW) and Fort Lee (7.4 \xc2\xb1 0.5 dBmW) show good agreement with the expected\nvalues. The discrepancies can be attributed to the accuracy of the measurement, which is\napproximately \xc2\xb10.5 dB. The wideband radiated power measurements thus corroborate the\nmeasurements of transmission line loss and antenna gain.\n4 RAIN-GAGE SYSTEM\nThe rain-gage network, siting, and operating procedures were presented in section 2.2.2.\nIn this section, the equipment, equipment calibration, and equipment measurement accuracy\nare discussed.\n4.1 COLLECTION AND MEASUREMENT\nThe tipping-bucket gages used in the experiment were of the standard type consisting\nof a sampling orifice with a sharp edge and high collar to reduce splashing, a funnel below\nthe sampling orifice to direct the water into the metering cups, and a pair of balanced\nmetering cups mounted below the funnel and on a pivot so one cup emptied while the other\ncup was being filled. The cup size and weight was adjusted so that the cup being filled\nmoved away from the funnel when a prescribed amount of water was collected. The motion\nor tip was electrically sensed and displayed as an event mark or a step on a chart recorder.\nEach tip indicated the accumulation of a fixed volume of water. This is related to rain depth\nby\nAd\n\nv=-\n\n00)\n\nwhere\nV = volume of water per tip (cm 3 /tip)\nA - sampling orifice area (cm 2 )\nd = depth (mm/tip), a calibration constant\nDuring the experiment, the depth corresponding to a tip was changed for the gages located\nnear the common volumes by changing the orifice area as noted in table 2-5. The rain rate\n\n69\n\nwas obtained as an average rate between tips:\nd\nR= t\n\n10K\nAt\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\nR = rain rate (mm/hr)\nt = time between tips (hr)\nThe housings for the gages depended upon the manufacturer. The gages located in the\nvicinity of the common volumes (types II and III, table 2-5) had a conical shape near the\norifice as shown in figure 4-1 and were designed to house heaters for winter operation and\na recorder system. The gages were equipped with heaters but the heaters were not operated.\nThe 324-cm2 (8-in.) gages located at Eastville, Fort Lee, and LaRC (type I) were cylindrical\nin shape and the bottom section was enclosed to collect the water dumped by the measuring cups. The water could be drained for measuring total accumulation using a petcock on\nthe bottom of the housing. The 1829-cm2 (19-in.) gage at LaRC had a funnel shape and\nno enclosure for recording apparatus or storing water. Aerodynamic investigations of gage\n\nBISTATIC RECEIVING\nANTENNA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFigure 4-1.\xe2\x80\x94Type I and III rain gages.\n\n70\n\nshape (ref. 18) have shown that, of the gage shapes used in the experiment, the funnel shape\ncauses the smallest perturbation to the wind field around the gage. The maximum measurement error due to perturbations in air motion over the gage is small and is estimated as less\nthan 3 percent for the cylindrical gages. (See ref. 19 for comparison between gage measurements.) The cone-shaped gages presented a much larger cross section to the wind and the\nerror was estimated to be 5 percent.\n4.2 RECORDING SYSTEM\nThe gages located near the common volumes used portable 45-day chart recorders\npowered by alkaline type-D-cell batteries. The recorders were installed within the rain-gage\nhousing. The chart was pressure sensitive and was fastened to a drum with a total recording\narea of 14 by 24 cm. The recording operation was continuous for the complete 45-day\nperiod using a chart speed of approximately 1 cm/hr and a stylus motion along the axis of\nthe drum of approximately 3 mm/day. The events were recorded by stepping the recorder\nstylus up or down for each tip, five steps in each direction (as in fig. 5-5).\nAt Eastville, a strip chart recorder was used with a chart speed of 45 in./hr (114 cm/hr).\nEach tip was displayed as a single tick or event mark on the chart. (See fig. 5-4.) The tip\nevent indication was displayed whenever it occurred and the chart drive was turned on at\nthe time of the first tip. The gage operation was manually supervised and the chart recorder\nwas turned off manually after an event or during a long interval with no tips during an event.\nThe operator manually logged the date and time on the chart and each first tip event was\nautomatically telemetered to LaRC and recorded on an event recorder.\nThe recording system at Fort Lee was identical to the one at Eastville until June 19,\n1971. After this date, the tip events were telemetered to LaRC and recorded directly on\nthe Z-fold chart used to record\'the bistatic radar data.\nThe recording system at LaRC was similar to that used at Eastville with the exception\nthat two event channels were recorded, one for the 324-cm2 gage and the other for the\n1829-cm2 gage. The larger collecting-area gage was used to turn the recorder on. In addition, the tip events from the 324-cm2 gage were recorded on the Z-fold chart used to\nrecord bistatic radar data after June 19, 1971. (See fig. 5-2.)\n4.3 GAGE CALIBRATION\n4.3.1 Type II and III Gages\nThe gages located in the vicinity of the common volumes were used without extensive\ncalibration. The manufacturer\'s nominal calibration constant or depth accumulation per\ntip was used in the data reduction and is listed in table 2-5. A limited number of calibration checks were performed in the field. These checks were made by measuring the quantity of water required to cause a prescribed number of tips. The flow rate used was typically\nbetween 10 and 20 mm/hr when making the calibration measurements. Field calibration\nmeasurements for the common volume gages were performed using 10 tips for each gage.\n71\n\nThe field calibration indicated that the system was operating as expected. The manufacturer\'s specifications state that the gage calibration constant should be within 0.5 percent of\nthe nominal value at 12 mm/hr and 6 percent at 150 mm/hr. The in situ calibration measurements show that, when the calibration data from each of the gages were averaged, the\nmanufacturer\'s calibration constant resulted. The maximum uncertainty in the measured\ncalibration constant for a single gage was 12 percent. By virtue of similarity in gage construction and the small error stated in the manufacturer\'s specifications, the averaged calibration constant was applied to each of the gages. These calibration values apply as long as the\ntipping measurement cup assembly is maintained in a level state using a bubble spirit level\naffixed to the assembly. Gage level was periodically checked throughout the measurement\nand adjusted if required to maintain operation in accordance with the manufacturer\'s\nrecommendations.\n4.3.2\n\nType I Gages\n\nThe gages located at the sites were calibrated at several rain rates prior to installation\nin the field. Both gages sited at LaRC were calibrated by measuring the average time between two tips for 1000 tips at a fixed flow rate into the gage orifice. The calibration was\nrepeated at a number of flow rates and, knowing the collecting area and using equation (11),\npage 70, the calibration curves shown in figure 4-2 were obtained. Two curves are displayed\n6000\n\n600\n\n1.0\n\n10.0\n\n100.0\n\nRAIN RATE, mm/hr\n\nFigure 4-2.\xe2\x80\x94Calibration curves for type I gages.\n\n72\n\nfor each gage: a linear relationship curve implying a single calibration constant that does\nnot depend upon rain rate and a best-fit curve to the calibration data implying a calibration\nconstant that depends on rain rate. The calibration constants given by the linear relationships are listed in table 2-5. The difference between the best-fit calibration and the linear\nrelationship assumed by using a single calibration constant is typical of tipping-bucket rain\ngages and is responsible for the 6-percent error at 150 mm/hr quoted by the manufacturer\nof the type II and III gages. The 324-cm2 gages located at Eastville and Fort Lee were\nidentical to the LaRC 324-cm2 gages in construction. Their calibrations were checked at\none rain rate prior to installation and found to be within 10 percent of the LaRC 324-cm2\ngage. After installation, the gages were periodically calibrated. The in situ calibrations for\neach gage were made using rates of 10 to 30 mm/hr and 50 tips for each measurement set.\nThe calibration constants derived from the in situ measurements agreed with the preinstallation curve within 9 percent. The estimated accuracy of the in situ measurements is \xc2\xb17 percent. The in situ measurements for the LaRC 324-cm2 gage agreed with the preinstallation\nvalue within 3 percent. Checks for level were made for the site gages during each pre- and\npost-rain-event calibration.\n4.4 ERROR ANALYSIS\nRain-gage measurements are subject to a variety of errors, including calibration, aerodynamic effects, and siting. The errors are listed in summary form in table 4-1. The\naccuracy values are listed both as a percent error for rain-rate measurement and a decibel\nerror in the estimation of dBZ where equation (9), page 22, is used to convert rain rate to Z.\nRepeatability estimates were also made for the gage system but not for the individual elements shown in the table. Measurement accuracy probably changed as a function of surface wind conditions and perhaps other parameters. Comparisons between the accumulations for each event measured with the closely spaced common volume gages showed\ndifferences as large as 47 percent on two occasions under conditions of widespread, longduration rain (where one would expect reasonable agreements). For these events the\naccumulation of the 1 OK gage was 46 or 47 percent low when compared with the averaged\n\nTable 4-1.\xe2\x80\x94Rain-Gage Accuracy and Repeatability Estimates\nType I, 324- and 1829-cm2 area\n\nType II, 324-cm2 area\n\nAccuracy\n\nAccuracy\n\nErrors\n\nPercent\nCalibration\nAerodynamic\nSiting\nTotal\n\nAccuracy\n\nRepeatability\n1 2 mm/hr\n\nType I I I , 159-cm2 area\n\n100 mm/hr\n\n0.5\n.2\n\n7\n3\n\n0.5\n.2\n\n10\n\n.7\n\n10\n\n.7\n\n100 mm/hr\n\n1 2 mm/hr\n\ndB Percent dB Percent dB Percent\n\n7\n3\n\n-\n\n\'\n\n5\n\n.3\n\nRepeatability\n\nRepeatability\n12 mm/hr\n\nlOOmm/hr\n\ndB Percent dB Percent dB Percent dB Percent\n\ndB Percent\n\ndB\n\n-\n\n12\n5\n7\n\n0.8\n.3\n.5\n\n16\n5\n7\n\n1.0\n.3\n.5\n\n25\n\n1.6\n\n29\n\n1.8\n\n47\n\n12\n5\n7\n\n0.8\n.3\n.5\n\n14\n5\n7\n\n0.9\n.3\n.5\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2.7\n\n25\n\n1.6\n\n27\n\n1.7\n\n47\n\n2.7\n\n-\n\nNOTE: All values are \xc2\xb1.

Il6 or dBZ = 2 3 + 1 6 log R.\n\n73\n\naccumulations of both the 5K and 20K gages. The 5K and 20K accumulations agreed with\neach other within 3 percent. Using this difference to estimate repeatability for the type II\nand III gages as sited, a value of \xc2\xb12.7 dB was obtained for the estimate of Z. Measurements\nof the variability of total accumulation were also made using the two LaRC tipping-bucket\nrain gages, counting tips, and the calibration constants for the 10- to 20-mm/hr range. The\nresults show differences ranging between 0 and 5 percent. The maximum deviation of 5\npercent was taken as an estimate of repeatability as shown in the table.\nThe accuracy of gage calibration was determined using the in situ measurements just\ndescribed. The calibration errors for the common volume type II and III gages are shown\nas rain-rate dependent as specified by the manufacturer. The other gages have a change in\ncalibration constant with rain rate as shown in figure 4-2. Data taken with these gages were\nconverted to rain rate using the calibration curve after adjustment to match the in situ calibration values at rates between 20 and 30 mm/hr. The calibration accuracy for type I gages,\ntherefore, is not rate dependent.\nThe aerodynamic errors are due to perturbations in the wind field as caused by the\ngages and were discussed previously. The siting errors were due to obstructions or to the\ngage being sited on and near the edge^of a building as discussed in section 2. The effects of\nsiting cannot be obtained from a description of the area. The siting errors as listed were\nobtained from a comparison of total gage catch with the catch of gages in the nearby area.\nThe LaRC, 5K, and 10K gages were sited along a line toward Quantico. The 5K gage was\n6.4 km from LaRC and the 10K gage was 12.8 km from LaRC. The 20K gage was 12.4 km\nalong the same line from the 1 OK gage. The Williamsburg NWS gage was approximately\n20 km from the 10K and 35 km from the LaRC gages as shown on figure 2-1. For 10\ngenerally widespread rain events between July and October 1971 when all but the 5K gage\nwere in operation and all gages caught measurable quantities of rain, the total accumulation\nfor each gage was calculated and compared with each other. The accumulations for the\ntipping-bucket gages were computed by counting tips and multiplying by the gage calibration constant that was determined for rates between 10 and 20 mm/hr. The LaRC gage\naccumulations were also computed by integrating the rate measurements obtained using the\ncalibration curves. The LaRC 1829- and 324-cm2 gages agreed with each other within 3 percent and the two different accumulation computation techniques agreed with each other\nwithin 2 percent. The LaRC 324-cm2 catch was within 2 percent of the 236-mm catch of\nthe Williamsburg gage. The 10K and 20K gages, although closer to Williamsburg, had\nsignificantly less catch, being about 30 percent low. The Fort Lee, Eastville, and Norfolk\nNWS gages all had catches within 15 percent of the Williamsburg gage.\nThe catch comparisons show that the type II and III gages in the vicinity of the common volume have significantly lower catch than the other gages in the area. Some of the\nvariability may be due to natural changes in the total rainfall. As a second estimate of siting\nerror, the catch of the 1 OK gage was compared with the NWS gages at Norfolk and Richmond.\nData for phase I and the entire year were used. The 10K gage was used because it was the\nonly gage in service for the entire measurement year. The comparison between the 10K gage\ncatch and the average of the catches at the Norfolk and Richmond gages showed the 10K\n\n74\n\ngage accumulation to be 25 percent low for the year and 7 percent low for the winter\nmonths. The total catch comparison includes the effect of siting, aerodynamic gage errors,\nand calibration errors. Because the siting errors will vary over the year due to changes in\nthe prevailing wind conditions for summer and winter storms, it is concluded that the total\nerror for the 10K gage should be 25 percent in agreement both with the year measurements\nand the 10-storm comparison with the Williamsburg gage allowing for local changes in rain\naccumulation. Working the accuracy estimation budget backward, the error for siting is\n7 percent. It is noted that the small siting errors are due to the offsetting effect of the\nrather large gage calibration errors that resulted from the limited field calibration effort for\nthe type II and III gages. The average of the limited number of calibration attempts for these\ngages was within 0.5 percent of the manufacturer\'s specifications; and, if his accuracy\nestimate of 0.5 percent was used, the siting error numbers would be 18 percent, which more\nrealistically describes the severity of the siting problem. In comparing the 10K gage data\nwith the NWS data, it is noted that the year\'s accumulation at Richmond was within 8 percent of the accumulation for Norfolk with Norfolk registering 1099 mm. For the winter\nmonths, the Richmond and Norfolk NWS accumulations were within 6 percent. In making\nthese comparisons and the comparison between their average with the 10K data, data for\nsnow events were not used.\nFor the months of October 1970 through March 1971 both the 5K and 10K gages\nwere operable. During this time period, the accumulation for the 5K gage was 9 percent\nbelow that of the 1 OK gage, presumably because of the additional shielding caused by the\nconiferous trees near the gages. The Richmond and Norfolk gages were within 4 percent of\neach other with Norfolk registering 405 mm. The 5K gage was 20 percent below the average\nof the two NWS gages and the 10K gage 10 percent below. Although the effect of shielding is obvious, the extent to which it degrades measurement accuracy is not. Because of\nthe change in prevailing surface wind during the year, the 5K gage may well register a higher\ncatch than the 10K gage for some period of the year as was observed during several widespread rain events in the summer. The accuracy estimate for the 5K gage is assumed to be\nthe same as for the 1 OK gage as given in the table because better information is not available. Similarly, the 20K gage is assumed to have the same sitirg error. In estimating the\naccuracy error budget, the overall error value obtained from comparison with NWS gages is\nattributed to the 12-mm/hr case because only a very small part of the total accumulation is\ncontributed by rates above this value. No siting error was attributed to the type I gages\nbecause no obstacles were present and the comparisons with nearby gages were within the\nestimated measurement error.\nThe accuracy estimates as given are for the measurement devices as installed in the\nfield. Errors in measurement are also caused by chart reading uncertainties. These errors\nare. particularly large for the type II and III gages. The change in collecting area converting\ntype II to III was made in an attempt to reduce the reading errors. These errors are discussed in the data processing section, section 5.\nThese accuracy estimates assume that the rain rate to be measured does not vary during\nthe time required for a bucket tip. At rates above 15 mm/hr (31 mm/hr for the type III\n\n75\n\ngage and 5 min/hr for the 1829-cm2 type I gage), one of more tips occur within a 1-min\ninterval and changes in rain rate during the time to accumulate the tip do not affect the\nfinal I-min averaged rain rate. At rates below this threshold, the time between tips is larger\nthan the 1-min integration time desired. The 1-min rate values may be in considerable error\nfor rates below 2 to 5 mm/hr (4 to 10 mm/hr for type III and 1 to 2 mm/hr for 1829-cm2\ntype 1) because 3 to 6 min are required to accumulate sufficient rain for a tip; during this\ntime interval a shower may have passed having a rate that is several times the indicated value\nbut a duration that is small compared with the time between tips. The threshold value of\n2 to 5 mm/hr for adequate gage measurements corresponds to Z values between 28 and 34\ndBZ, which is approximately equal to the bistatic radar system measurement threshold imposed by the transfer characteristics of the logarithmic detector.\n5 DATA PROCESSING\nThe types of data and associated processing techniques were summarized in section 2.\nThe data were edited, scaled, and averaged as depicted in figure 5-1. The editing process\nused the hourly summary data as described in sections 2.3 and 2.5. The data sources and\nrecording modes are shown in figure 3-11. This section describes in detail the reading and\naveraging techniques used to handle the bistatic radar and rain-gage data. The precision of\nthe reading and correction factors required to estimate a true average value are also considered. Accuracy and repeatability estimates for data processing are considered in reference\n13.\n5.1 BISTATIC RADAR DATA REDUCTION\nThe bistatic radar system was described in sections 2 and 3. The data provided by this\nsystem were recorded both on magnetic tape and on eight-channel strip charts (Z-fold). As\ndiscussed in section 2.3, the data were edited prior to reading to reduce the amount of data\nto be scaled. Scaling was done only for the primary measurement paths and was accomplished by using a card containing the calibration levels prepared from the periodic calibration data on the Z-fold charts, placing the card on the chart at the selected time for a value\nto be read, estimating the level in dBmW for that time, and listing the value rounded to the\nnearest decibel. The scale card was constructed using a linear interpolation in decibels between each 10-dB calibration step.\nA sample Z-fold recording for phase II from the rain event on September 11, 1971, is\nshown in figure 5-2. The eight channels recorded include two for the 324-cm2 rain gages at\n\nOBTAIN\n.\n\nHtlAjn\'L\xc2\xbbcu\xc2\xbb\n\nDATA\n\nAND SCALE\n\nAVERAGE\n\nFigure 5-1.\xe2\x80\x94Data processing flow diagram.\n\n76\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 . r,. ,,\n\n,-rr-\n\nr03\n\nr\nas\n\n\xe2\x80\xa25\na\n\nI\ncji\nLO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2c\n\n77\n\nLaRC and Fort Lee; two for the GC path system receivers for Eastville Fl and Fort Lee F3;\nand four for the Fl, F2, F3, and F4 frequencies for the bistatic radar system (30-ft antenna).\nTwo of the bistatic radar channels recorded integrated (1.5-s time constant) data from the\nEastville and Fort Lee 10K paths and two recorded switched data (without integration)\nalternately from the 20K and GC paths. The data for each minute for the switched paths are\nlabeled on the sample Z-fold. The two types of bistatic radar data that must be scaled can\nreadily be seen. The integrated 10K data provide a clean trace that may be readily hand\nscaled. The 20K and GC data are not integrated and present a solid smear because of rapid\nfading that is difficult to read. A summary of the reading techniques and their precision is\ngiven in table 5-1. The event pens on the edge of the strip chart were used to indicate time.\nThe event pen above the Fort Lee F3 horn channel alternated position every minute and\nindicated to which antenna the F3 transmitter at Fort Lee was connected. The event pen\nbelow the Fort Lee F3 30-ft channel provided LaRC site timing information by being in one\nstate for 40 s and the other state for 20 s. This timing pattern was inverted every hour to\nmark hours on the chart.

See sec. 5-1.\n\n78\n\nand the GC horn receiver system was synchronized with the Fort Lee 1-min timing marks so\nthe data could be identified with the correct path.\nThe data were read using scales prepared from the calibrations that occurred every 2 hr.\nGenerally, the calibration closest to the data was used. The calibration signal was stepped\nbetween -65 and - 135 dBmW in 10-dB steps. As noted on the calibration sequences on the\nZ-fold, the scale was not linear in decibels and severe compression occurred for signals below\n-115 dBmW. Received signal levels between the 10-dB points were estimated by linear\ninterpolation. For signal levels above -115 dBmW, the maximum deviation of the actual\nscale as determined using 2-dB steps from the scale obtained by linear interpolation was less\nthan 0.8 dB (as shown on fig. 3-10). The degree of curvature changed slightly from calibration to calibration, and 1.5 dB represents the maximum deviation from the piecewise linear\ncalibration scales.\nThe 1 OK integrated data were read in two different ways. For data from rain events\nbetween June 4 and June 22, 1971, the 1-min average was subjectively estimated and the\naverage position was scaled (method B, table 5-1). For data obtained during the rest of phase\nII, the scaling and averaging were accomplished by reading the signal level every 10s, transforming the logarithmic level to a linear value, averaging six successive values, and expressing\nthe result in decibels (method A, table 5-1). A sample of 10-s-sampled and processed data\nfor September 11, 1971, is shown in figure 5-3. The 10-s-sampling rate is below the\nNyquist rate and the errors resulting from processing in this manner must be evaluated\nstatistically (ref. 13). Data for one event were processed both by subjective average estimation\nand the 10-s-sampling methods. A comparison of 1-min estimates of the averaged value\nobtained using both techniques differed by as much as 4-dB maximum and 1-dB rms. In\nthe comparison it was noted that if the signal changed little within the minute, the two\nmethods differed by less than 1 dB; but, under conditions of large change within the minute,\nthe results differed markedly. The data as scaled were rounded to the nearest decibel. The\n10-s-sample and average process had a precision of \xc2\xb10.3 dB using 10-s readings quantized in\n1-dB steps. The result of the averaging was also rounded to the nearest decibel and quantized\nin 1-dB steps with a precision of \xc2\xb11 dB. The subjectively averaged reading also was quantized\nin 1-dB steps and had a precision of \xc2\xb13 dB. The precision estimates as quoted do not include\nthe effects of scale nonlinearity.\nThe rapidly fading 20K data appear as a smear on the strip chart. The data were read\nby subjectively determining the 1-min average position of the upper and lower edges of the\nsmear, scaling the upper and lower edge values, and tabulating both the upper edge value and\nthe average of the upper and lower edge decibel values. The upper and lower edge values were\nestimated using the positions on the chart where the heavy inking stops. Only a few fluctuating signal spikes appear above that apparent level. For a limited period between May 5\nand June 22, 1971, the 10K channels were recorded with and without integration. A\ncomparison of both reading techniques was made using data obtained during this time interval. It was empirically determined that for normal inking or ink flow from the recorder pen\nand the normal 0.1 mm/s chart speed, the average difference between the average of the\nupper and lower edge values (method D, table 5-1) and the integrated, 10-s-sampling and\n\n79\n\n-98\n\nC.

Using this empirically determined\naverage difference as a correction factor, the precision of method D was, after quantization,\n\xc2\xb14 dB. Readings based only on the upper value on the chart (method C), after correction\nby an empirically determined factor of-9.9 \xc2\xb1 0.3 dB, had an estimated precision of \xc2\xb13 dB.\nData for the 10K paths from phase Ib were not integrated, except for the period between May 5 and June 4, 1971. The phase I switching sequence was used prior to April 17,\n1971, so that data for each path were measured for only 1 min out of every 4. Two scaling\nmethods were used during the time period prior to May 5, 1971. The first method consisted\nof estimating the l-min average value by subjectively picking a point physically halfway between the upper and lower edge of the smear on the chart (method E). The second method\nused a point halfway between the upper edge and the bottom edge of the display area for\nthe channel (method F). For signals with estimated average values below about -112 dB,\nboth methods were identical because the bottom edge corresponds to the lowest possible\ndisplay value. For signals above that level the two methods produce different values. Above\n- 100 dBmW, method E is identical to method D because the scales become approximately\nlinear in decibels at higher signal levels. An estimate of the precision of scaling using\nmethod E, including the differences in performance of the personnel reading the charts, and\ncorrecting by the 2.3-dB factor is \xc2\xb15 dB for levels above -100 dBmW. The required correction factor for signal level estimates below -100 dBmW is signal level dependent. Because of\n80\n\ncompression, the correction factor becomes smaller at lower signal levels, being about 1 dB\nat - 1 1 5 dBmW. The precision of the measurement also increases as the signal gets weaker because the bottom edge becomes better defined as a result of scale compression. At signal\nlevels near - 1 1 5 dBmW, the precision is estimated at \xc2\xb14 dB. For ease in data correction, the\ncorrection factor for method E is assumed to be 2 dB for all signal levels above - 1 1 5 dBmW\nand the precision is assumed to be \xc2\xb15 dB.\nThe other reading technique (method F, table 5-1) uses the bottom edge of the display\narea and has a signal level dependent correction factor that continuously increases in magnitude for indicated signal levels above -112 dBmW although the precision of the measurement\nremains constant and at \xc2\xb15 dBmW provided the correction is known. The estimation of the\nmidpoint between the upper edge of the smear and the bottom of the chart used in this reading process requires only an estimate of the position of the upper edge. The correction\nfactor required for this scaling process must include both a factor relating the estimated value\nto an estimate of the position of the upper edge and the -9.9-dB upper edge to average correction factor. The precision of this correction factor, however, depends upon calibration\nstability because the physical distances will vary from calibration to calibration. Calibration\nstability amounted to an additional \xc2\xb11.6 dB during phase Ib. The precision of the resultant\nsignal level correction scheme therefore has a poorer precision value, estimated at \xc2\xb17 dB.\nPhase la data were read using the automatic analog-to-digital converter and computer\nat ITS (method G). The automatic reading system played back the FM analog recording\ntapes at high speed (25 times faster than the recording speed), sampled the data without integration at a rate equivalent to 80 samples per second at the rate as recorded (2000 samples\nper second at the fast playback rate), and recorded the analog-to-digital converted values on\ndigital magnetic tape for computer sorting. The analog magnetic tape system had a low-pass\nprerecording filter with 74-Hz bandwidth, and the analog-to-digital sampling rate was below\nthe Nyquist rate. The computer sorted the data for each channel and minute to provide\ndistributions of analog-to-digital units within the minute. The median and mean values for\neach distribution were selected, scaled from analog-to-digital units to received signal levels\nusing the calibration data, and printed for subsequent use. The calibration records were read\nin a manner similar to data. The median analog-to-digital unit value for each calibration was\nassigned the received signal level value for that calibration minute. Calibration curves were\nconstructed by linear interpolation in decibels between the 10-dB-stepped analog-to-digital\nunit calibration values. For long data runs, the calibration levels were linearly interpolated\nin time between calibrations (to improve accuracy). For short runs close in time to calibrations or long runs with skipped calibration, the set of calibrations closest in time were used.\nThe computer printouts were used to provide 1-min median signal level values. These levels\nwere corrected by subtracting 0.5 dB to provide an estimate of the average value. The\nanalog-to-digital converter and computer-processed data have a precision after correction of\n\xc2\xb11 dB.\nSeveral of the Z-fold charts, for nhase la events were .also hand -seated usifflff method E.\nWith a 2-dB correction factor, the results were within \xc2\xb14 dB of the computer-generated\n\n81\n\nvalues for signal level values (corrected) ranging from - 1 1 5 to - 1 05 dBm W. These results\nare in reasonable agreement with the empirical precision estimates given above (\xc2\xb15 dB).\n5.2 RAIN-GAGE DATA REDUCTION\nThe rain-gage data were recorded as event marks on strip charts as discussed in section 4.\nThe rain rate was determined by reading the time of each tip from the recorded charts, keypunching the times for entry into a computer, and using the computer to calculate the\naverage rain rate between tips and the 1-min averaged rates. The average rate between tips\nwas computed using the calibration curves given in figure 4-2 for type I data or equation (11)\n(p. 70) for type II and III data. The 1-min average rates were computed from the betweentip average rates by\n\n(12)\n\nR = \xe2\x80\x9460\n\nwhere\nR = 1 -min averaged rain rate (mm/hr)\ntk = time interval in seconds within the minute that corresponds to the averaged rate\n*k\nMk = averaged rain rate between tips (mm/hr)\n\nn = number of between-tip averaged rates that exist in the 1-min interval\nThe 1-min averages start with the time in seconds of the first tip and are recorded for successive 60-s intervals.\nThe reading precision for a rain-gage chart is expressed as the error in estimating the time\ninterval between tips. The error in rain rate is related to the error in time interval estimation\nby\n=\n\nMk\n\n(13)\n\n1+\n\nd\n\n\\\n\nd /\n\nwhere\n= rain-rate error (mm/hr)\nA/ = time interval estimation error (hr)\nd = calibration constant (mm/tip)\nFor the 1-min averaged values the rain-rate error AR is estimated by\n\nn(n 82\n\n324 cm2\n\n1829cm2\n\n_L\n1538\n\n1536\n\n1534\n\n1532\n\n1530\n\n1528\n\n1526\n\nLOCAL TIME (EDST)\n\nFigure 5-4.\xe2\x80\x94Sample recording of LaRC type I rain gages\xe2\x80\x94September 11, 1971.\n\nor, if\xc2\xab = l\n\nTwo types of charts were used. For the type I gages, the data were recorded at 45 in./hr\nchart speed with single event marks as shown in figure 5-4 for a sample of data from the rain\nevent on September 11, 1971. Type I gage data were also recorded on the Z-fold charts and\ntip indications were shown in figure 5-2. Type II and III data were recorded on 45-day\ncharts. An entire chart for September 2 through October 6, 1971, is shown in figure 5-5.\nThe tips on the 45-day charts are indicated by step level changes.\nThe time of a tip on the Z-fold chart was read to the nearest second with a position\nuncertainty of \xc2\xb12 s. Time of tips on the other type I Esterline-Angus (EA) strip charts were\nread to the nearest second with a \xc2\xb1l-s precision. For scaling using the Z-fold data, the precision is \xc2\xb12.4 percent at 12 mm/hr and \xc2\xb18.0 percent at 100 mm/hr. Scaling from the type I\nEA strip charts yields a precision for the 324-cm2-gage data of \xc2\xb11.2 percent at 12 mm/hr\nand \xc2\xb14.0 percent at 100 mm/hr and for the 1829-cm2-gage data of \xc2\xb14.0 percent at 12 mm/hr\nand \xc2\xb112 percent at 100 mm/hr. Converting these estimates to decibels using equation (9),\npage 22, the precision is \xc2\xb10.2 dB at 40 dBZ and \xc2\xb10.5 dB at 55 dBZ for the Z-fold charts and\n\xc2\xb10.1 dB at 40 dBZ and \xc2\xb10.3 dB at 55 dBZ for the EA type I 324-cm2-gage charts. The precision estimates are summarized in table 5-2.\nThe times of the tips on the type II and III chart records were read to the nearest 0.01\nhr or 36 s with an accuracy of \xc2\xb10.01 hr for rates below 12 mm/hr. At higher rates the\nmeasurement was made by counting the number of tips in a 60- to 180-s interval, measuring\nthe time between the first and last tip in fhe interval, determining the average interval between tips, and assigning times for each tip so they are uniformly distributed between the\nfirst and last tip. The scaling process for type II data is estimated to have a precision of\n\n83\n\nSTATION: AMOCO 10K\nTOTAL\n\nDATE\n\n24\n\n1\n\n2\n\n34\n\n56\n\nSTART DATE: 9-2-71, 1055\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nEND DATE AND TIME: 10-6-71, 1545\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n21\n\n22 23\n\n9-4\n9>6\n\n90\n\n"\n9-10\n\no,>"\n\n-^u\n\n_J^\n\' "t\n- \' o ^\\^\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2^^\n\n9-14\n\n9-16\n9-199-18\n9-20\n9-21\n9-22\n9 23\n9-24\n0-^\n\ng-299-28\n\n^\n\n9-30\n\n_j-\xc2\xbb\\j l/\n\n\\fs~ \'""\n\n10-3\n\nV\n\n*>_r\n\n1&2\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 i\n\n10-4\n\n10-5\n\nV\n\n1&6 -^\n\n24\n\nH-^1545\n10-6-71\n\n"-.-*\xe2\x80\x94\n\n1\n\n2\n\n34\n\n56\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11 12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15 16\n\n17 18 19\n\n20\n\nFigure 5-5.-Sample recording of type II and III gages-September 2 to October 6,1971.\n\n\xc2\xb117 percent at 5 mm/hr, \xc2\xb132 percent at 12 mm/hr, and \xc2\xb136 percent at 100 mm/hr. These\nprecision estimates apply to the 1-min average values provided by the computer although\nthe reading process averaged the rate over a 1- to 3-min interval. Additional errors may\noccur because the data do not represent a true 1-min average because the effective integration time is larger than 1 min. An analysis of the latter type of error is given in reference 13.\nType III data used a smaller collecting area in an attempt to increase reading precision.\nWith the collecting area halved, the resultant precision is estimated to be \xc2\xb19 percent at\n5 mm/hr, \xc2\xb119 percent at 12 mm/hr, and \xc2\xb130 percent at 100 mm/hr. An example of type\nIII processed data for September 11, 1971, is given in figure 5-6. Both the between-tip\naveraged rates M and the 1-min averaged rates are shown. The effect of quantization of the\ntip duration is evident in the discrete rate value displayed in the between-tip averaged data.\nThe 1- to 3-min averaging between tip intervals is also evident in the several minute constant\nrain-rate estimates at rates above 25 mm/hr.\nThe computer program provided clock 5-min and clock 60-min average rain rates in\naddition to the 1-min averaged data. The clock 5- and 60-min averages were computed in\nthe same manner as the 1-min averages with the exceptions that the averaging period was\n300 to 3600 s, not the 60 s used in equation (12) (p. 82), and the starting time for the 5-min\n\n84\n\nTable 5-2.\xe2\x80\x94Rain-Gage Chart Reading Precision Estimates\nType I\n324-cm2 area\n\n.\n\n324-cm2 area,\n45-day chart\n\n1829-cm2 area, EA chart\n\nEA chart\n\n159-cm2 area,\n45-day chart\n\nZ-fold chart\n\nReadmg\n12 mm/hr\nPercent\n1-min average\nClock 5-min average\nClock 60-min average\n\n1.2\n.6\n.2\n\ndB\n0.1\n.04\n.01\n\n100 mm/hi\nPercent dB\n4.0\n2.0\n.6\n\n12 mm/hr\nPercent\n\n0.3\n.1\n.04\n\n2.4\n1.2\n.4\n\ndB\n0.2\n.1\n.03\n\n12-mm/hr\n\n100 mm/hr\nPercent\n8.0\n4.0\n1.2\n\ndB Percent\n0.5\n.3\n.1\n\n4.0\n2.0\n.6\n\ndB\n0.3\n.1\n.04\n\n100 mm/hr\n\n1 2 mm/hr\n\nPercent dB Percent dB\n12.0\n6.0\n2.0\n\n0.8\n.4\n.1\n\n32.0\n16.0\n4.8\n\n100 mm/hr\nPercent\n\n2.0\n1.0\n.3\n\n36.0\n18.0\n5.4\n\n12 mm/hr\n\ndB Percent\n2.1\n1.2\n.4\n\n19.0\n9.5\n2.9\n\n100 mm/hr\n\ndB Percent\n1.2\n.6\n.2\n\n30.0\n15.0\n4.5\n\ndB\n1.8\n1.0\n.3\n\nNOTE: All data are \xc2\xb1 values.
