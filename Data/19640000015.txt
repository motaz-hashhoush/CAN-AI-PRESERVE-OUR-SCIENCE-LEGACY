b"May 1964\n\n\t\n\nBrief 64-10025\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\nThis NASA Tech Brief is issued by the Technology Utilization Division to acquaint industry\nwith the technical content of an innovation derived from the NASA space program.\n\nImproved Electrode Gives High-Quality Biological Recordings\n\nSeal (Such AsJ\nMicropore Tape)\n\nMystic-Type Taped\n\nElectrode\n\nSilver/S\nChloride Electu\n\nDouble-Sided T\n(Such As Stomasea\n\nSkin\n\nThe problem: Obtaining high-quality waveforms,\nsuch as those registered by electrocardiographs (EKG),\nelectroencephalographs, or impedance pneumographs\nwhen the subject is engaged in considerable physical\nactivity. Researchers making biological recordings\nhave found that the electrode is the weakest link in\nthe recording process and every effort must be made\nto reduce spurious signals. Silver/silver chloride\nelectrodes are the most suitable for biological recording because of their stability, low potential, and\nruggedness. Most electrode attachment systems, however, either permit transient signals through intermittent contact with the skin, or limit the freedom\nof action of the subject.\nThe solution: An improved electrode assembly\nwhich consists of a cup containing an electricallyconductive paste and a silver electrode plate. The paste\nmaintains continuous contact with both the subject's\nskin and the silver electrode plate, and causes much\n\nless skin irritation than other preparations commonly\nused for this purpose.\nHow it's done: The electrode assembly consists of a\nsilicone rubber cap which holds a perforated silver\ndisk that has been prepared as a silver/silver chloride\nreversible sensor. Improvement in the electrical conduction between the electrode and the skin is effected\nby the addition of a paste which is a 10-times\nisotonic concentration of Ringers' physiological solution, thickened with a soluble resin.\nSilver/silver chloride electrodes can be made by\nsoldering a wire to a silver disk and then covering the\nsolder joint with a synthetic-rubber adhesive to prevent electrolytic action. After careful cleaning the\ndisk is anodized in 0.1 N HC for 20 minutes at no\nmore than 3 milliamperes per square centimeter from\na 6-volt battery. A test conducted in I N NaC1 should\nregister a potential between electrode sets of less than\n1 millivolt.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and S p ace Administration.

Care is taken to ensure that the\nelectrode assembly is completely filled with paste and\nproperly sealed.\nNotes:\n1. This innovation is useful to the medical profession or to biological researchers who require\nhigh-quality electrocardiogram waveforms, or\nother kinds of biological recording. It is best\nsuited to tests where the subject must be physically\nactive. This type of electrode assembly has remained in place on a subject for periods as long\nas 96 hours. The subject engaged in normal activities, including baseball and showers during this\ntime.\n\nBrief 64-10025\n\n2.
