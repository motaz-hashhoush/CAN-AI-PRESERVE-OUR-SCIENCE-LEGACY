Orbital debris, or \"space junk\", is composed of the man-made remnants of non-functioning spacecraft still orbiting the Earth. NASA estimates that there are currently over 100,000 orbital debris particles 1 centimeter in diameter or larger that cannot be tracked by existing radar, with the population growing at approximately 4% per year in low earth orbits. With an average velocity of over 8.7 km/sec, these projectiles can penetrate and disable many vulnerable spacecraft systems. Since the likelihood of spacecraft penetration increases with spacecraft surface area, large spacecraft (such as the International Space Station) and communication satellite fleets (such as Iridium) have begun to adopt survivability enhancement strategies similar to those employed by combat aircraft. Collision avoidance maneuvers are commonly practiced by the Space Shuttle and are planned by the International Space Station to decrease their susceptibility to impact by trackable orbital debris; likewise, improved shielding, internal equipment placement, and improved crew operations following penetration can reduce the vulnerability of spacecraft to loss following orbital debris impact. Computer simulations such as the Manned Spacecraft and Crew Survivability (MSCSurv) program at the NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center have recently been developed to quantify and reduce the likelihood of crew or spacecraft loss following orbital debris penetration. The AIAA Survivability Technical Committee is working to enable the transfer of military-developed survivability technologies to help the aerospace industry cope with this growing threat.", "title": "AIAA Survivability Technical Committee Draft", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T08:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990080068, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Shipman, Jim"}, "organization": {"name": "Pratt and Whitney Aircraft", "location": "West Palm Beach, FL United States"}}, "id": "574b323910124786870cd274ce841ae0"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19990080068, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Williamson, Joel"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL United States"}}, "id": "80a8f6a159834ff786b55daaeb61fa4c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990080068, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990080068, "id": "6e73e877c6094a39b240f840b8952855", "publicationName": "Aerospace America", "publicationDate": "1997-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
