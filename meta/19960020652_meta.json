These electrothermal thrusters operate at specific impulse levels of approximately 300 s with heater powers of about 500 W. Low power arcjets (1-3 kW) are currently being investigated as a way to increase specific impulse levels to approximately 500 s. Ion propulsion systems can easily produce specific impulses of 3000 s or greater, but have yet to be applied to communications satellites. The reasons most often given for not using ion propulsion systems are their high level of overall complexity, low thrust with long burn times, and the difficulty of integrating the propulsion system into existing commercial spacecraft busses. The Electrostatic Plasma Accelerator (EPA) is a thruster concept which promises specific impulse levels between low power arcjets and those of the ion engine while retaining the relative simplicity of the arcjet. The EPA thruster produces thrust through the electrostatic acceleration of a moderately dense plasma. No accelerating electrodes are used and the specific impulse is a direct function of the applied discharge voltage and the propellant atomic mass.", "title": "Electrostatic Plasma Accelerator (EPA)", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T09:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960020652, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brophy, John R."}, "organization": {"name": "Center for Advanced Space Propulsion", "location": "Tullahoma, TN United States"}}, "id": "aa9bc2556cec4e3d9d8660de87b4167b"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19960020652, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Aston, Graeme"}, "organization": {"name": "Center for Advanced Space Propulsion", "location": "Tullahoma, TN United States"}}, "id": "df670d12bae043dd9f65da7471e48969"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960020652, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960020652, "id": "5db77d5618e74fed957b0d3e4abd4b22", "publicationName": "Center for Advanced Space Propulsion", "publicationDate": "1995-10-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19960020642, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Center for Advanced Space Propulsion", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
