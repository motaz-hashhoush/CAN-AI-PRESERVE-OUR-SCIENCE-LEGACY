Frosch calls the action\n\n"necessary and proper to achieve the objective of national\ntechnical superiority through joint action with U.S. domestic\nconcerns."\nThe guidelines are intended to facilitate the entry of\nAmerican industry into an area traditionally left to the\nFederal government because of the high technology and high\neconomic risks involved.\n\n\'\n-moreSeptember 17, 1979\n\n-2-\n\nSpace flight has been virtually untapped as a unique\nlaboratory for materials processing.\n\nGround-based research,\n\nhowever, as well as experiments in the Apollo, Skylab and\nApollo-Soyuz flight programs and with sounding rockets, showed\nthat materials in a liquid state behave much differently in\nthe near weightlessness of space than on Earth, and that this\nbehavior in space can be used to advantage in preparing a\nnumber of substances.\n\nFor instance, there are no convection\n\nforces to make differing fluids segregate and no need for\ncontainers to hold materials as they are cast.\n\nAs a result of extensive materials-processing research\nalready conducted on Earth, areas of potential commercial\ninterest in space are:\n\nsemiconductors -- electronics, com-\n\nputers; infrared detectors \xe2\x80\x94 medicine, spacecraft; nuclear\ndetectors \xe2\x80\x94 medicine, spacecraft; solid state lasers \xe2\x80\x94\ncommunications, optics; microwave devices \xe2\x80\x94\n\ncommunications,\n\nsolar power; castings, alloys, composites and metal foams -metallurgy, machine tools; blood fractionation, purified\nhormones, enzymes, vaccines, products of live cells, cell\nculturing \xe2\x80\x94\n\nmedicine.\n\nThe joint venture program envisages a government-industry\nrelationship in which the risk capital and technical know-how\nof industry works in concert with the resource capabilities of\nNASA to develop and enhance U.S. commerical leadership in the\nfield of materials processing.\n-more-\n\n-3-\n\nTo this end, NASA is providing a number of incentives\nto American industry, including:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Flight time on the Space Transportation System;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Technical advice, consultation, data, equipment\nand facilities;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Joint research and demonstration programs;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Proprietary information protection.\n\nAmerican companies desiring more information on NASA\'s\njoint venture program should write to:\n\nDr. John Carruthers,\n\nDirector, Materials Processing in Space, Code EM-7, NASA\nHeadquarters, Washington, D.C. 20546.\n\n-end-\n\n'
