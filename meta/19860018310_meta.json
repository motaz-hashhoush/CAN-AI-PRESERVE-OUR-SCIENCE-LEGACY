A stratosphere balloon launching facility and its capabilities are reviewed. Observations of the stratospheric aerosols with a balloon-borne aerosol computer were made. Long term monitoring of stratospheric aerosols induced by volcanic eruptions are made with a ruby lidar. The main parameters of an ST radar system are given. The ionospheric D region is investigated with the method of ionospheric absorption. And photochemical modeling and radiation parameterization of the middle atmosphere are made.", "title": "MAP-oriented research in the People's Republic of China", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T18:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860018310, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lu, D."}, "organization": {"name": "Academia Sinica", "location": "Beijing, China"}}, "id": "cedfc7e467a6493c8f2cbc6a6190aa5d"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19860018310, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860018310, "id": "c5ee829dd67e4c948476ab9a26e15df3", "publicationName": "International Council of Scientific Unions Handbook for MAP, Vol. 18", "publicationDate": "1985-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
