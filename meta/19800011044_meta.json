Exact analytical results were developed for both the mean and standard deviations in the designated search mode. The mean value is compared to the results of a previously reported simulation. The analytical results are more optimistic than the simulation results, for which no explanation is offered. The normalized standard deviation is shown to be very sensitive to signal-to-noise ratio and very insensitive to the noise correlation present in the range gates of the designated search mode. The substantial variation in the CFAR threshold is dominant at large values of SNR where the normalized standard deviation is greater than 0.3. Whether or not this significantly affects the resulting probability of detection is a matter which deserves additional attention.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800011044, "id": "a0db41144e7e4839b67c300133f88e88", "publicationDate": "1979-01-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19800011044.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19800011044/downloads/19800011044.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19800011044/downloads/19800011044.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19800011044/downloads/19800011044.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
