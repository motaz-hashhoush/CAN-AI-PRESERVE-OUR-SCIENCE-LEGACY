His numerical results were derived by inserting physical conditions at two particular depths beneath the umbral surface. Seven variables must be specified at each point. We have extended Moore's analysis to examine the depth-dependence of overstable oscillations in a recently computed umbral model. Electrical conductivity is evaluated taking full account of partial ionization and magnetic fields. In the surface layers, within 250 km of the top of the umbral convection zone, the conductivity  is so low that Joule dissipation is more rapid than the growth rate of oscillations. In these layers, Moore's results are therefore not applicable. At greater depths, oscillations can grow and we agree with  Moore that both umbral flashes and penumbral waves may be due to overstable oscillations. However, we suggest that both phenomena can arise at the same depth in the spot, and not in two layers, as Moore suggests.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "30", "submissionId": 19730056685, "id": "7092374c831a4421908c1463a9ce0cad", "publicationName": "Solar Physics", "publicationDate": "1973-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
