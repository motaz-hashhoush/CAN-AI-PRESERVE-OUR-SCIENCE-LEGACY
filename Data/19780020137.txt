I h\'TRODUCT I ON\n\nThere are three moving base gravity gradiometers currently under\nt\t\n\ndevelopment. The ins:trumvnt!^ are being developed at Hughes Research\nLabs [Ref. 1], the Bell Aerospace Corp. [2], and the Charles Stark\nDraper Lab. [3, \xe2\x80\xa2 11. The design goal for each of the sensors is 1 Edtvbs.\nFurthermore, 0.1 Ebtvds (E) accuracy should be feasible from an orbiting\ngravity gradiometer 151. The group of instruments includes sensors\ndesigned specifically to measure the gravity gradient, as well as sensors,\nwhich utilize existing accelerometers to provide a gradient estimate.\nThe Hughes and Bell instruments rotate, thus modulating the information.\n\'this rotation transfers the gravity gradient signal to a higher frequency, quieter part of the spectrum, and can separate the signal from\nsome sources of instrument bias, The Draper Lab sensor measures the\ngradient signal at zero frequency and uses a sophisticated flotation\nsuspension system to isolate the sensing element from errors induced\nby rotation and jitter. A system of at least three instruments of any\none type is required in order to provide a complete gravity gradient\ntensor estimate. Often times, however, it is possible to extract all\nthe information that is required from a single one of these instruments.\nThe primary objectivesof this paper, oriented toward the use of a\nworkable gravity gradiometer as a sensing element in several applications, are given below:\n1)\n\nTo develop models for gravity gradient anomalies and gravity\nanomalies,\n\n2)\n\nTo evaluate several methods of on-line instrument bias estimation,\n\n3)\n\nTo determine the performance of a gradiometer in mapping the\nearth\'s gravity field,\n\n4)\n\nTo assess inertial navigation systems augmented with a gravity\ngradiometer.\n\n-1-\n\nThe work under this contract, and the work under a separate contract (Goddard 5FC r- KAS 3-21960) to evalijate the performance\nof a geodesy mission with orbiting gradiometers have some overlap,\nespecially in the groundwork areas of instrument performance and capability, and gravity models. As such, we hope it will be valuable to\n:supply some results from work performed under that contract in this\nFinal Report,\n\n-2-\n\nwhile 1106"\n\nk1l sI p\n\nIIQ\t\n\nVwOnca\nJOVICUM ........................ .......\n\nChapter II\n\n\xc2\xa7MwjjWmL4WTV CM\n\nGRAVITY AND GRAVITY GRADIENT MODELS\n\nIn order to evaluate the capability of gravity gradiometers, or\nsystems in which the gravity hradwmeter is an essential component,\nsome mo del of the type of inputs is required. Several of the models\nare:\n1)\n\ntesseral harmonic models using Kaula\'s rule [7]\n\n2)\n\ntesseral harmonic models using Allan\'s rule [a]\n\n3)\n\npoint mass and line mass models,\n\n4)\n\nexperimentally determined second\xe2\x80\x94order random process models.\n\nOnce a give- model is chosen, the gravitational potential, force,\nand gradient can be ascertained. The choice of which model is to be\nused in a given implementation depends on the dynamic range of interest\nfor a given system (which is in turn dependent on the system\'s speed\nrelative to the earth). This can vary substantially, from fixed base\napplication, to ship speed, airplane speed, and finally, orbital speed.\nThe various models also result in different degrees of complexity.\nThis, too, must be considered for anv mechanization involving gravity\ngradiometers,\nThis chapter contains the expressions for the gravity forces and\ngradients, and their correlation based on various gravity models.\n\nA. TESSERAL HARMONIC MODELS\nThe most general expression of an arbitrary function over the\nsurface of a sphere that satisfies the potential equation is in terms\nof tesseral harmonics. The tesseral harmonic expansion of the earth\'s\ngravitational potential is\n\nI\n(\n\nPtm (sin q)) [ C.(.m\n\ncos mN\n\nnV= I r )\n\n(1)\n+ S (m\n;ice\n\nsin mT]\n\nwhere (r,^,^) is the position of a test point in terms of the spherical\ncoordinates, radius, latitude, and longitude; p . = GM(D; R a) = radius\nof the earth; P (m (x) are normalized associated Legendre polynomials, \t\nand C (m and 5 (m are normalized tesseral harmonic coefficients, which\ngive the amount of e a ch harmonic present; th e perturbation potential\ndue to a particular harmonic is simply\n\nV (m = r^ (r\xe2\x80\x94, P (m (sin cp) J (m\t\n\n(2)\n\nwhe re\n;7\nS\xe2\x80\x94+\n\nJ(m\nand in writing\n\n(\n\n2\n\n(m Ctm\n\n2), the phase information is lost.\n\nEstimates of the magnitudes of the JQm\'s are given by Kaula\nand Allan [8]. Kaula\'s familiar rule of thumb for\n_\t\nJ im ^\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nis\n\n5\n\n2 2\n\t\n\nJ-(m\n\n[7]\n\n( 3)\n\nG\t\n\nwhile Allan\'s more complicated formula is\n\nti\n.(\n\nJ12.2 X 1 0\n\n+ 3/2\n\n(0.93)f\n\t\n\n(4)\n\nm\n(2-f +i)\n\n,/2t\n\n+3\n\nAlthough, different in form, both formulas agree quite closely over\nhuge ranges of the subscript C, and with measured values of the\ntesseral harmonic coefficients,\nWith estimates of the magnitudes of the J (m in (3) and (4), it\nbecomes possible to estimate the magnitude of the perturbation potential\n1\'tm ,\n\nand hence of the force () and gradient (1 ) perturbations, since\n\n\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x93\n\n4\n\n7\t\n\n^_V\t\n\n(5a)\n\nar\n\na nd\nT\n\nr\n\n3\t\n\n(5b)\n\nIf we further assume that the phases of the harmonics are random,\nit becomes possible to obtain closed-form approximate expressions for the\nvariance of the perturbation forces, the variance of the perturbation\n\ngravity gradient, and the covariance of the perturbation forces and\ngradients dui\' to the tesseral harmonics.\nThe total variance of the force is computed for a representative\nforce component (f\n\nt, )\n\na 2\t\n\nvia Kaula\'s rule. It is given by\n\nK(f2) = 3\' ( f ) 2 Q (m sec 2 ) 2\t\nr\t\nrF\nk\'\n\nf\n\n(G)\n\nwhere f r\xc2\xa3 is the radial force perturbation due to the Qth harmonic,\nTile extra j in (6) is due to the fact there are Q distinct harmonica\n(m\t\n\n1 to j) for a particular j,\nf t , is obtained as the radial derivative\n2\n\nIle, ( 11191\nQ\t\n\nso\nf r\t\n\nr\t\n\n(7a)\n\n0 Jim\t\n\nP im (sin\n\nr !}\n\n(R Q+2\nP Qm(sin\n-t g -r \t\nA)\n\nT)\n\n(7b)\n\nJQm\t\n\nsince\n\na2\nr\t\n\n= g(62 )\nr\n\nwhere g is the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the earth.\nSquaring (7), inserting it into (6), using that\n\nP2\n\n(sin\n(sin\t\n\n_\n\nby definition, and using Kaula\'s rule for J\nCm,\n\n-3-\n\nwe obtain\n\ncp), avr -\n\n6\n\n1\n\n8(fr}\t\n\ntYf\t\n\nso\t\nCr\n\ni\'\n\n\'\n\n_\t\n^2\n\n2\n\nx\n\ng\n\n10-10 ^2r R \xc2\xae19 F L ( (D) 24 \t\n`` f ^Lz.\'2\n\n2\n\nK\n\ni0-5\n\nX\n\n2\n\nl"g\t\n\nr !\t\n\n(8g)\n\nr(P\t\n\nR 2\t\n\n(8b)\n\n1 \xe2\x80\x94(7\n\nAn identical Approach leads to closed- - form expression for the gradients.

( 8), (10), (11), and (12) are plotted in Fig. 1.\nIt shows the standard deviation of the force perturbations and gradient\nperturbations at various altitudes. Figure 1 also shows that as the test\npoint approaches the earth \' s surface, the standard deviation of the\ngradient using Kaula\'s rule blows up, a phenomena that physically does not\noccur. Although Kaula\'s rule is in common use. it evidently does not\nattenuate the high frequency components rapidly enough to produce a finite\nstandard deviation at the surface. Allan\'s rule does provide for a more\nrapid attenuation of the high frequency components, due to the presence\nof the ( 0.93)\t\n\nterm in (4), and does result in finite force ar : d gradient\n\nvariances.\nOne useful feature of the closed - form solutions of the standard deviations is the ability to determine what amount of variance is due to\ndifferent portions of the spectrum. A particularly simple example is\nobtained from the force components in (11). The analytical expression\nfor Cr f due to harmonics above some degree k is easily found to be\n-v/T\n1.28 x 1075g\n- where again x = 0.93(R T/r) 2 . Near the sur1 - x\nface of the earth, then, the percent of variance contribution due to\nharmonic degree greater than or equal to k is given as\n\nx\n\nk+2\n\nI - x\t\n2\t\n\n-\n\nx\n1-x\n-7-\n\nx\n\nk\n\n;F\n\nVs\n\n10 \t\n\ng\'s\n10\n\n----- g COLUMN\nE COLUMN\n\t\nKAULA\n\n102\n\nALLAN\n\n101\t10\n\n1\n10\xc2\xb0\n\n11\n11\n\n16-1\n1 m\t\n\n10 m\t\n\n100 m\t\n\n10 km 100 km 1\n\n1 km\t\n\nkm 19000 km\n\n11^\n102\n\nSolid line is Eotvos units column or ordinate.\nDash line is g column or ordinate.\n\nFIG. 1 1 a VALUES FOB FORCE AND GRADIENT PERTURBATIONS.\n\n-8-\n\n\t\n\nwhere x % ( 0, 9:3). In order to account for only 50 % of the noise, a\nmodel of fifth degree (- 30 coefficients!) is required, for 75% of\nthe noise 10th (-110 coefficients) degree, etc, The gradient components\nattenuate even less rapidly requiring an even higher order model. This\ncertainly proves that an improve6 tesseral harmonic model of the earth\nis not the way to go in order to Improve navigator accuracy due to the\nhigh degree of the model required to give even modest improvement.\nIn order to compare results of other models to this model, the correl-\n\nation coufficWts for F rT and g \t\n\nand for Prr\n\n-\t\n\nI{ 7c and g\t\nr\n\nwere\n\nII\n\ncomputed on the basis of the tesseral harmonic model with random phases,\nThese correlation coefficients are given below near the earth\'s surface\n\nF (I\'rT,\n-- \xe2\x80\xa2+ 0.6:3\n\nRCS)\t\nj1.1 ) N E (0)\n\nand\n\n^UEC rr r 49 ]LEN\n\nB, POINT MASS AND LINE MASS MODELS\n\nThe point mass and line mass models approximate local gravity\nanomalies much better than the tesseral harmonic model which has primary\nuse in describing global features.\nA simplified analysis of a point disturbance begins with the assumption of a point mass with mass md\' \xc2\xb5d - Go d , and a local 2_U x, y\ncoordinate frame as is shown in Fig. 2.\n\nFIG. 2 POINT MASS MODEL\n\n-X\n\n\t\n\nM\n\n\'rhe disturbance potential clue to }td at a point (x, y) is simply\n\nV - G1/1\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nVr r + yam.\nW\n\n\xc2\xb5\n\nFxpreasions for the forces and gradients are\n\neasily obtained by taking the respecttve partial derivatives,\n\n1\t x\t\n\nNx\t\nr\t 3\t\n\nf y\t\n\nt\xe2\x80\xa2 3\n(13)\n\n1\'\t xx\t\nwhere t\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n3}1(-X + yL)\t\n\nP\t yy\t\n\nr\t\n\n5\t\n\nXX\n21,\t xy b-k5\n\n\'\t\n\n1.\n\nwF% 4\n\n\'rhe correlation be \xe2\x80\xa2 two,n the tour quantities in (13) can be found\nby assuming each of t .ht \xe2\x80\xa2 ui\n\nis stn\n\nindepu title tit meas tire meitt., and that the\n\nMea:turement y are Obtained along a prescribed path in the x, y plane.\nFor simplicity, the path chosen here is the path y \t\n\nw\n\nconstant, and x\n\ncon stant rate (the path an airplane might\nfollow), \'rite itirormatiott matrix is then Oven by\n\nproceeds from -w to\n\n-i\n\nat\n\nit\n\nI\' x\nf\nI\n\ny\nxx\n\nt\'\t\n\nf ,\t\n1\'\t\n\nI\'\t\n\n-;\'\t\n\nxx y ,y\t\n\nl\'\t\n\nxy\n\n]dx\t\n\n(14)\n\nyy\n\nsy\n\nand the covariance matrix P is simply 1-1, Normalized off-diaKonal\nelements\n\nof\n\n1)\n\ngive\n\nthe\n\ncorrelation coefficients.

To determine if line mass models or\n\npoint mass models result in better performance will require surveying\ndata to discover if local gravity perturbations are more accurately\nmodeled with line amsses or point masses. Surprisingly, the use of\npoint masses vs line masses produces relatively minor differences, The\nline mass model is shown in Fig. 3.\n\n-12-\n\nz\n\nLINE MASS MODEL\n\nF\'IG. 3\t\n\nThe disturbance potential V is simply\nao\t\ndz\t\nV = -2\t\n\n4 (x2+y2+z2)\t\n\n_ -2\n\nj\n\n^4adz\t\nO r\n\n(18)\n\nwhere now a is a mass per unit length.

The identical substitutions are\nmade Here as in the point mass model, the integrations carried out, and\nthe results are that 7\n\nis correlated with f\t\n(and with nothing else)\nxy\t\nx\nwith correlation coefficient OF - 0.71 and that P xx - r\nis\nyy\n\ncorrelated with f y ( and with nothing else) with correlation coefficient\n- 1/^/\'l = -0.71. Although the correlation is not as strong as with the\npoint mass models, it is still quite high. Perhaps it is appropriate\nin the final model, to actually use a correlation coefficient between\nthe values given by line mass models and point mass models. Again,\nscale heights can be derived to relate directly the gradient perturbations with the force perturbations.\n\n--14-\n\nAn obvious advantage of these correlation models over dynamic models\nof the earth\'s gravity gradient perturbations, deflections of the vertical,\nand perturbation force components, is the simplicity. A dynamic model\ninvolves earth surveying to "fit" parameters in the model, which may\nthemselves vary substantially over different regions of the earth.\nAn added advantage is that the correlation models do not involve "augmenting the state" of the system, as do the dynamic models.\n\n-15-\n\nr\n\nChapter III\n\nBIAS ESTIMATION\n\nRegardless of the eventual use of the gravity gradiometer, some type\nof signal processing will be required to minimize the effects of one of\nthe largest gravity gradiometer errors: an unknown instrument bias.\nAs will be discussed in Chapter V, a gradiometer bias has the same\neffect as a gyroscope drift when used in an inertial navigator, i.e.,\nthey both produce unbounded position errors with increasing time. When\nthe gradiometer is used as the sensor to perform geodesy experiments\nfrom orbit, the gradiometer bias produces a bias in the estimate of the\ndominant term of the earth\'s gravity field.\nThis Chapter contains a study of several attempts to eliminate the\ngravity gradiometer bias error.\nOne greatly simplified model of the bias estimation problem is\ngiven below. A single (rotating) gradiometer supplies two pieces of\ninformation of the gravity gradient at a point, the difference of two\nprincipal elements of the gravity gradient tensor and one diagonal component. For example,\n\nZ\n\ny x11 - x22\n(20)\n\nz 2\t\n\nx12\n\nA set of three such gradiometers pointing in orthogonal directions\nalong with Laplace\'s constraint equation (that the sum of the diagonal\nelements equal zero) is sufficient to determine the gravity gradient at\na point; i.e., the problem below:\n\n-17PFiEC=NQ PAM BLANK\n\nz \t\n\n= x 11 - x22\n\nz2\t\n\nz3\t\n\nx12\n\nx22 - x33\n\nz4 = x23\n\nor z = Hx\t\nz5\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n(21)\n\n33 x11\n\nz6 _ x13\n\nz 7 - x11 + x\n\n22 + x 33\t\n\n0\n\nis invertible, and hence solvable for x in terms of z. (It is not\ninvertible without the constraint equation z 7 .) in fact, A = (HTH)-1HTz.\nEven if random noise v i with covariance r\n\nis inserted into each of\n\nthe first six equations in (21), it is possible to obtain a leastsquares estimate for x in terms of z. In fact, x = (H TR 1H)-1 HT R 1z\n-1 .\nand the variance of the estimate error P = (HTR-1 H)\nSince z 7 is\nan "exact" measurement though, either infinitesimal values for the\ncorresponding element of R must be used and a limit process applies\nor else the matrix inversion lemma [10] may be used. The matrix inversion lemma can yield the improved covariance matrix P from the covariance matrix P\'. P\' is the easily computed covariance matrix which\ndoes not include the beneficial effects of the exact constraint equation.\nThe formula relating P to P\' is\n\nP = P\' HT (HP\'HT )" lisp\'\n\nwhere H reflects the constraint equation structure that\n\nx11\n\n+\n\nx22 +\n\n= 0 = Hx\n\nx3\n\nso\nH= [1\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n-18-\n\n0\t\n\n0\t\n\n03 .\n\nL-\n\nThe advantage of the matrix inversion lemma procedure is that it\ncompletely avoids the limiting processes mentioned earlier.\nNow consider the problem of augmenting the state vector with conetant but unknown biases, 1 bias per gradiometer. Now\n\nx11 - x22 +\n\nz\n\nb\n\nz2\n\nx12\n\nz3\n\nx22 - x 33 + b2\n\nz4\n\nx23\n\nz5\n\n_\t\n\nz6\n\nz7\n\n+\n\n+ b2\n\nX1+\n\nx33\n\nx11\n\nx\nz\t =\t H\' --b 3\tb\n\n+ x22 + x 33\t\n\nand although the sum of the biases b\nz\n\n(23)\n\n4 b3\n\nx13\n\n_\t\n\nb\n\n0\n\n+ b 2 + b 3 is obtainable (from\n\n+ z 2 + z 3 - z 7 ), it is impossible to obtain any other combination of\n\nthe biases (in particular, the individual biases) and, therefore, it is\nimpossible to solve for x.\nThe only useful results from (23) are obtained if there is some\na priori estimate of the biases. In this case, the usual Kalman filter\ntechniques will allow for estimates of x to be obtained from noisy\nmeasurements, however the conditioning of the problem is of course dependent on the initial accuracy of b. If I 0\ntion on tho augmented state (P O = I-I ),\n\nis the initial informa-\n\nthen the update equations are\n\nsimply\nxl _ x0 +\n\n(I1)-1 H,TR-lz\n(23)\n\nI, = I D + HITR-1H,\n\nwhere H\' is the measurement matrix for the augmented state vector,\n-19-\n\nand R the covariance of the measurement accuracy.\nThe advantage of the initial information, 1 0 , is evident in the\nsecond equation of (23). Whereas HITR 1 is not invertible, the sum\nH\nI ll + H I T it 1 H\' is invertible and hence the inverses appearing in the estimate update equation are valid.\nMore sophisticated schemes for estimating the biases make use of\ndynamic models of the system, as opposed to the model in which both the\ngradient components and the biases were constants. Of course, since an\na priori model of either the measurement or the state presumes additional\ninformation is available, it should be expected that better results could\nbe obtained at the expense of additional complexity.\nTwo additional bias estimation schemes will be discussed. The first\nmakes use of the fact that the bias is fixed in the instrument frame, while\nwhat tht\xe2\x80\xa2 gradiometer measures will generally be fixed in an inertial frame.\nRotating the spin axis of the gradiometer should then distinguish between\nthe gradient components and the bias terms. The second method again\ndistinguishes between the gradient components and the bias terms but now,\nthe mechanism is via a model of the gradient perturbations. This is where\nmuch of the material from Ch. I can be used.\nBeginning; first with the rotation scheme, an expression for ^, the\ngradient tensor is\nrlI\n\nr12\n\nrl3\n\nr12\n\nr22\n\nr23\n\nr13\n\nr23\n\nr33\n\nAssuming the gravity gradiometer spin axis is rotated about the 1 axis\n\nr\n\n= T\n\n-2d-\n\nC\n\nTT\n\nit\nS!\n\nwhere\nt7\t\n\n1\t\n\n0\n\n0 Cos (Wt \t\n\nand w is\n\nsin(wt)\n\n0 \xe2\x80\x94sin(wt)\t\n\nT\t\n\ncos(wt)\n\nthe rotation frequency.\n\nThen a single i;radiometer, capable of measuring (say, without loss of\ngenerality) the 7\n\n11 \xe2\x80\x94 722 and 712\n\n22\n= 711 \xe2\x80\x94 (r\n\nz\n\ncomponents would output\n\ncos 2wt + 2723 sin wt cos wt + F 33 sin 2Wt)\n\n+ b 1 +v 1 ;\n\nz 2\tP12cos\n\nwhere b\n\nA\n\n+ T\'\n\n13\n\nsin wt + b 2 + v 2\n\nand b 2 are biases, and v 1 and v 2 are random noise.

Note\n\nthat for t z. U, the time\xe2\x80\x94 varying H iii (24) agrees with the H in\n(23).\n\nThe standard test for observability can be performed on the matrix H\nin (24) to determine the maximal rank of the matrix\n\nH^\n\nH\n^\t\n\n=\n\nH\n\nIt turns out that the maximal rank of 0 is 7, so one mode is still\nnot observable. Additional algebra yiel6s the result that the mode\nb1 - r11\n\nis not observable, but that 2/3 b\n\n+ r ll is observable. What\n\nthis says is that it is still not possible to distinguish between \'11 and\nb. This result is easily explainable since the gradiometer spin axis\nnever has a vertical component with the single axis rotation scheme we\nhave considered here. However, if a umo axis rotation scheme where the\nspin axis of the gradiometer spans all directions, all the parameters are\nobservable, and hence the gradient components and individual biases are\nobtainable from 7.\nA problem with the continuous rotation schemes yet to be discussed\nis the i ntroduction of a gradient field due to the kinematics of the rotation itself, The vector formula for this induced gradient field is\nd^\n= "4) - IL" .\t\ndrr [\'W X(W X r) \t\n\n(25)\n\nIn two dimensions the gradient field reduces to simply w 2 . If the spin\naxis rotates as slowly as 2n/50 sec, the required accuracy of this\nrotation rate to obtain full potential of the fixed instrument accuracy\nis - 1 part in 1079 ; Since this accuracy is not feasible, the continuous rotation schemes are ruled out.\n-22-\n\nr\n\ntill, some use can be made of the preceding analysis. The fact that\nall the states and biases are observable with the continuous two axes\nrotation scheme means that with a sufficient number of discrete measurement points, the same information will be available. This can be accomplished in several ways. One scheme is to "calibrate" the gravity gradiometer at a fixed position, in several orientations to obtain the bias. If\nthe bias is truly constant, the unit could then be used at new locations\nwith the predetermined value of the bias. A second scheme is to simply\nrepeat measurements with a moving base gravity gradiometer with the instrument oriented in different directions. For example, in a surveying mission,\neither with an airplane or satellite, it is possible to retrace a groundtrack while making measurements in (three) different orientations. This\ndetermines the bias and states on-line, in which case the effects of bias\ndrift could be minimized.\nThe second scheme for distinguishing the gradient components from the\nbiases is via a dynamic model of the gradient components. A simplification of a model to appear in a later chapter appears below. Again, letting\nx denote the gradient components, a linear dynamic model of x would be\nx = Fx + rw where w is a random process. Since b = 0, there is again\na mechanism for distinguishing x and b.

INTRODUCTION\nInertial navigation is based on the simple principle that position\nis given by the double integration of acceleration. Accelerometers do\nnot measure accelerations themselves but measure specific forces which\nare defined as all forces acting per unit mass with the exception of the\ngravity force. Hence, in order to obtain true accelerations, the specific\nforce due to the gravity must be subtracted from the outputs of the accelerometers, in other words, the gravity acceleration must be added:\n\n(38)\n\na = f + g\t\nwhere\n\nii\n\n= acceleration of the vehicle\n\nf = specific force\ng = gravity acceleration of the earth.\nCurrent inertial navigation systems use a\n\nIt\n\t\n\nellipsoid\n\nmodel" to compute the gravity acceleration of the earth, given the vehicle\nposition. Although the reference ellipsoid model can well approximate\nthe real gravity field of the earth, the difference is becoming a major\nerror source of inertial navigation systems because of rapid hardware\ntechnology advances With accelerometers and gyroscopes [11].\nThe difference between the actual gravity and the reference ellipsoid model may be expressed in terms of gravity anomaly (magnitude)\nand deflections of the vertical (angular deviation), f12].\n\n-31-\n\n\t\n\n;..7\n\nFrom measurements taken at 12.5 nm intervals across the 35th parallel\nin the United States, the standard deviation and the correlation distance\nof the vertical deflection were determined as 5.2 areseconds and 25.1n mi,\nrespectively [Gelb, A.1974]. The worldwide vertical deflection ensemble\nis considered to have 8 aresecond rms and 20 n mi correlation distance [131.\nCompensation for the errors caused by the gravity deflection and anomaly is one of the principal applications of gravity gradiometers currently\nunder development. Gravity gradiometers measure gravity gradients which\nare related to gravity acceleration by the following relation:\n\nr\n\t\n\ndt\n\nv\t\n\n(39)\n\nwhere\n\nr = gravity gradient tensor of the earth\nv = velocity of the vehicle.\nGiven the gravity gradients with the velocity and the initial values\nof the gravity, we can integrate (39) to obtain the gravity. However, as\nis well known, bias errors of the gravity gradiometers may produce unbounded\nposition errors as time increases. This fact is easily seen by the following simple example illustrated in Fig. 5. Assuming that only error source\nis the bias of the gr diometer, the linearized error propagation equation\nfor a single horizontal channel with constant speed may be given by\n\nAl - AV\n\n\t\n\n(40a)\n\nA^ = \xc2\xa9gx\t(40b)\npg\n\nx\t\n\n= vA r + r AV\t\nxx\t\nxx\n\nwhere\nAx.

He obtained a number of numerical results for a single horizontal channel, assuming velocity reference errors, accelerometer errors, and\ngradiometer errors.\nIn the following sections, we try to obtain an analytical solution for\nHeller\'s mechanization, considering the gradiometer error as the only error\nsource. Then, we extend his mechanization to estimate the bias error of the\ngradiometer (the bias error in this case means the difference of the means\nof the outputs of the gradiometer from the gravity deflection model).\n\nH.

Gradiometer measurements are combined with a gravity\ndeflection model to estimate the navigation errors via use of a Kalman filter.

This means that even if the Kalman\nfilter gives a smaller covariance as shown in Fig. 8, it does not give improved information near zero frequency, but worse. Hence, when the power\nspectral density of the gravity deflection error at Schuler frequency is\nlarger than q V the covariances of position and velocity errors are larger with gradiometers than without.\n\nC. BIAS ESTIMATE\nIn this suction, we make an attempt to extend Heller\'s mechanization\nto estimate the bias error of the gradiometer, introducing the bias as an\naugmented state in the Kalman filter discussed in the previous section.\nThe bias error in this case means the difference between the means of the\noutputs of the gradiometers and the gravity deflection model.\nThe measurement equation (44) may be rewritten as\n\n7, = - Pgt\n\n+ P gE\'+ vb + vVg\t\n\n(54)\n\nwhere b is the bias error of the gradiometer and the additional state\nequation is simply\nb - 0\n\n\t\n\n(55)\n\nThe full system consists of equations (42), (54) and (55). Direct application of the Kalman filter theory to this problem fails, however. Since\nthe bins is an undisturbable and neutrally stable mode, the Kalman filter\ngain associated with this mode becomes zero after the initial uncertaintly\ndisappears. This is a typical example of Kalman filter divergence.

As the amount of destabilization increases, the absolute value of\nthe eigenvalue associated with the undisturbed model increases from zero.\nHowever, the covariance of the estimation errors increases too.

Instead\nof equation (39), we use the gradiometer measurement to estimate the mass\ndensity distribution of the earth, then compute the gravity from the density distribution. This approach not only brings up a very interesting\nproblem, i.e., filtering of a distributed system,but also seems to have the\nfollowing practical advantages;\n(a) The bias of the gradtometer does not cause an unbounded position\nerror but, at most, excites the Schuler oscillation. This is\nbecause both the gravity and the gravity gradients are obtained\nby spatial integration of the mass density and time-integration\nof the gradiometer measurement is not needed.\n(b) Since the statistical model of the mass density distribution is\nneeded only at the boundary, the effect of the model error is\nsmall. Furthermore, there is little aifficulty in extending this\napproach to the actual inhomogeneous earth density field.\nOn the other hand, obviously this method requires large computer\ncapacity. However, since the correlation distance of the gravity deflection is about twenty nautical miles, we do not have to estimate the density distribution over large areas for inertial navigation purposes. This\nfact may relax the requirement of the computer capacity.\nSo far, we have derived the partial differential equation for the\ndensity distribution and obtained the filtering algorithm, including distributed Kalman filter gain. Numerical calculation is in progress.\n\n-51-\n\n_.^.,...\xc2\xab,^.\xc2\xbbv.n^.v.Mis\'r^i^\':/1^\'7^^1 \xe2\x96\xbaMIB.^L^\xc2\xb1...7 ,.,.:_.. ..\n\nChapter VII\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY\n\nSeveral gravity models, including\n1)\n\ntesseral harmonic model-,\n\n2)\n\npoint mass and line mass models\n\n3)\n\nsecond order random process models\n\nhave been studieci. As a result of the fact that inertial navigators are\nparticularly sensitive to what happens locally, it could be proved rigorously that.tlu tesseral harmonic model probably could never be implemented\ndue to the large number of parameters needed to obtain a suitably accurate\nlocal gravity description.\nThe second order random process model was studied in detail. We obtained an analytical solution for Heller\'s mechanization (GAEA), using a\nmore simplified problem formulation which still retains the part essential\n\nfor gradiometer study. The solution shows that the covariances of the\nerro rs in position and velocity are larger than those without gradiometer\n\nwhen Schuler frequency fulls within the bandwidth of the estimation error\nin the vertical deflection.\nWe extended Heller\'s Kalman filter to estimate the bias error of the\ngradiomoter, using the modal destabilization method to avoid Kalman filter\n\ndivergence.\nPoint mass and line mass models still should be considered, due to\nthe simplicity with which theta could be implemented. Future work will\ncontain numerical results based on these models.\nRecently, another method of obtaining gravity perturbations has coma\ncinder consideration, the estimation of distributed mass density. At this\npoint, the necessary analytical work has been completed, and future work\nwill include numerical results.\nTho problem of bias estimation of the gravity gradiometer has now\nbeen studied in some detail. After several schemes were considered, the\n\n-53-\n\ni\n\nppxCTi "LjG pga BLANK\n\nmost favorable methods to emerge are\n1) If possible, retrace a given groundtrack with the gradiometer\nin three different orientations.\n2) Calibrate the gravity gradiometer bias at a fixed location in\nmany different orientations to obtain the bias accurately before\n\nthe instrument is used as a system component.\nFinally, the results of using a gravity gradiometer to perform a\ngeodesy mission accurately are compared with competing schemes. A low\norbiting gradiometer appears to be the most effective way of obtaining\nthetesseral harmonics of the earth for order 40 and above, i.e., the high\nfrequency components. In the range below the 40th harmonic, the geodesy\nmission employing counter-orbiting drag free satellites is superior.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9454\xe2\x80\x94\ni\nf\t\n\n4\ni\n\n,3^\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
