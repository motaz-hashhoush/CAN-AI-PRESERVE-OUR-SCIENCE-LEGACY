The biocontainment barriers that protect the sample and the researchers from cross contamination are described. Specifically, the laboratory layout, laboratory equipment, the environmental control and life support system, and containment assurance procedures are discussed. The metal manipulation arm proposed for use within the biocontainment cabinets is described. Sample receipt and processing procedures are outlined.", "title": "The laboratory module", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T18:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19820012356, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820012356, "id": "62ecc24c844941f0a8cb9d7a4f99dc38", "publicationName": "Orbiting Quarantine Facility", "publicationDate": "1981-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19820012351, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Orbiting quarantine facility.
