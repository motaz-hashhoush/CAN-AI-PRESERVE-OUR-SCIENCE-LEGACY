b'ates terrain traversability cost; detects\nlow overhangs and high-density obstacles; and can perform geometry-based\nterrain classification (ground, ground\ncover, unknown).\nA new origin is automatically selected\nfor each single-frame terrain map in\nglobal coordinates such that it coincides\nwith the corner of a world map cell. That\nway, single-frame terrain maps correctly\nline up with the world map, facilitating\nthe merging of map data into the world\nmap. Instead of using 32 bits to store the\nfloating-point elevation for a map cell,\nthe vehicle elevation is assigned to the\nmap origin elevation and reports the\nchange in elevation (from the origin elevation) in terms of the number of discrete steps. The single-frame terrain\nmap elevation resolution is 2 cm. At that\nresolution, terrain elevation from \xe2\x80\x9320.5\nto 20.5 m (with respect to the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s\nelevation) is encoded into 11 bits.\nFor each four-byte map cell, bits are\nassigned to encode elevation, terrain\nroughness, terrain classification, object\nclassification, terrain traversability cost,\nand a confidence value. The vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s\ncurrent position and orientation, the\nmap origin, and the map cell resolution\nare all included in a header for each\nmap. The map is compressed into a vector prior to delivery to another system.\nThis work was done by Arturo L.

To facilitate communications of\nthe information in the Excel files, drawings are often generated. During the design process, the Excel files are updated\noften to reflect new input. The problem\nis that the drawings often lag the updates, often leading to confusion of the\ncurrent state of the design.\nThe use of this program allows visualization of complex data in a format that\nis more easily understandable than\npages of numbers. Because the graphical output can be updated automatically,\nthe manual labor of diagram drawing\ncan be eliminated. The more frequent\nupdate of system diagrams can reduce\nconfusion and reduce errors and is likely\n\n10\n\nto uncover symmetric problems earlier\nin the design cycle, thus reducing rework and redesign.\nThis work was done by Karl F. Strauss, Renaud Goullioud, Brian Cox, and James M.\nGrimes of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The software attempts to satisfy as many observation\nrequests as possible considering each\nagainst spacecraft operation constraints\nsuch as data volume, thermal, pointing\nmaneuvers, and others. More complex\nconstraints such as temperature are approximated to enable efficient reasoning while keeping the spacecraft within\nsafe limits. Other constraints are\nchecked using an external software library. For example, an attitude control\nlibrary is used to determine the feasibility of maneuvering between pairs of observations. This innovation can deal\nwith a wide range of spacecraft constraints and solve large scale scheduling\nproblems like hundreds of observations\nand thousands of combinations of observation sequences.\nThis work was done by Steve A. Chien,\nDaniel Q. Tran, Gregg R. Rabideau, and\nSteven R. Schaffer of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Because\nthe DTN protocols effect automatic, reliable transmission via multiple relays,\nCFDP-ION need only satisfy the requirements for Class 1 (\xe2\x80\x9cunacknowledged\xe2\x80\x9d)\nCFDP. This keeps the implementation\nsmall, but without loss of capability.\n\nThis innovation minimizes processing\nresources by using zero-copy objects for\nfile data transmission. It runs without\nmodification in VxWorks, Linux, Solaris,\nand OS/X. As such, this innovation can\nbe used without modification in both\nflight and ground systems. Integration\nwith DTN enables the CFDP implementation itself to be very simple; therefore,\nvery small. Use of ION infrastructure minimizes consumption of storage and processing resources while maximizing safety.\nThis work was done by Scott C. Burleigh of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nThe software used in this innovation is\navailable for commercial licensing.
