b'PA41C-1338 A Partnership for Global Impact and Resiliency\nRebekke Muench 1,3 , Eliot Levine 2\nSERVIR Science Coordination Office 1 , Mercy Corps 2 , University of Alabama in Huntsville 3\n\nAbstract\nMany researchers, particularly in the development sector, struggle with connecting their work with\non-the-ground users who will benefit from their research. SERVIR, a National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration (NASA)/ United States Agency for International Development (USAID) joint\nprogram strives to \xe2\x80\x9cconnect space to village\xe2\x80\x9d and to reduce through the use of geospatial technology\nand data. Partnerships with organizations, such as Mercy Corps, are important for connecting to the\nvillage level and ensuring that our work is benefiting the most vulnerable communities. Mercy Corps\nis a global non-governmental, humanitarian and development organization operating in transitional\ncontexts that have undergone, or have been undergoing, various forms of economic, environmental,\nsocial and political instabilities. Through the Mercy Corps and SERVIR partnership, we are able to\nbring together the remote sensing and geospatial technology expertise of SERVIR and the on-theground expertise of Mercy Corps.\nIn this talk we will provide additional background of this partnership as well as provide examples of\nhow we have collaborated thus far in the partnership. The partnership spans engagement from\nconnecting one another with our various partners to in-depth collaboration on specific projects.\nAdditionally, we will discuss some of the various goals and outcomes of the partnership that help\nframe our work together in the present and future.\n\nGoals & Objectives\n\xef\x80\xb4Connect Mercy Corps and SERVIR hubs so they are aware of one\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s relevant priorities and engagements\n\xef\x80\xb4Share and utilize one another\xe2\x80\x99s tools, approaches, and networks\nthrough collaboration\n\nHindu Kush Himalaya\n\xef\x80\xb4The SERVIR Hindu-Kush Himalaya located at ICIMOD in\nKathmandu, Nepal has been established since 2010 and has several\nexisting products and services\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Coordinate regional and global efforts and network when strategic\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Mercy Corps is able to provide a local perspective to SERVIR\xe2\x80\x99s\nflood forecasting, landslide susceptibility, and sugarcane coverage\nservices\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Local activities are led by regional Mercy Corps and SERVIR hubs\nwith support from the global partnership team when appropriate\n\n\xef\x80\xb4The SERVIR tools and expertise are able to be expanded to\nspecific locations that Mercy Corps-Nepal is working in\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Increase Mercy Corps\xe2\x80\x99 capacity in using earth observations and create\nlinkages that allow for SERVIR services to reach the local village level\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Mercy Corps is utilizing the current capabilities and tools on\ndeforestation and land use mapping to apply to their work in\nBangladesh with refugees\n\nCredit: DIPTENDU DUTTA/ AFP/\nGetty Images\n\nLower Mekong\n\xef\x80\xb4The SERVIR-Mekong hub, located at the Asian Disaster\nPreparedness Center (ADPC) has several existing data\nsets and tools that can be used to inform current Mercy\nCorps projects\n\nGlobal\n\xef\x80\xb4From a global level, SERVIR and Mercy Corps\ncoordinate activities and identify points of potential\ncollaboration\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Mercy Corps is utilizing the SERVIR-Mekong landslide\ninventory for one of their projects\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Mercy Corps attended the SERVIR Annual meeting\nwhich allowed opportunities to share various Mercy Corps\ntools that can be applied to SERVIR services\n\n\xef\x80\xb4SERVIR Mekong is working with Mercy Corps to\nidentify more ways to incorporate gender considerations\ninto SERVIR services\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Held a joint session at the 2018 Understanding Risk event\nin Mexico City, Mexico\n\nLessons Learned\n\xef\x80\xb4It is important to get everyone to speak the same\nlanguage when working across disciplines and outside of\n\xe2\x80\x9cnormal operating procedures\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nScience to Action\n\nMercy Corps\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Along with the regional examples, through the use of\nEarth observations and the partnership, communities\nwill be able to better respond to future changes\n\nSERVIR activities\nBoth SERVIR &\nMercy Corps\n\n\xef\x80\xb4The partnership allows for SERVIR\xe2\x80\x99s work to better\nconnect to the individuals at a local level\n\xef\x80\xb4Services are able to be better tailored for those who\nwill most benefit from them\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Face-to-face meetings provide value to have less\nstructured conversations and to better understand\nindividuals\n\xef\x80\xb4Regular and open communication is key to successful\nengagement and partnership.\n\nWest Africa\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Regularly scheduled check-ins and updates allow for\ncontinual communication and coordination as new\nopportunities arise\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nEastern & Southern Africa\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Mercy Corps and SERVIR-West Africa consortium

Science Team and the existing\ncapacities at AGRHYMET, SERVIR has expertise in utilizing various\ngroundwater models\n\n\xef\x80\xb4The goal of the collaboration is to improve existing LMS maps and\nensure that issues of livestock mitigation routes, conflicts, and\nhazards are incorporated\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Mercy Corps \xe2\x80\x93 Niger brought together a group of various stakeholders\nfor detailed discussion of the needs and ways to address these needs\n\n\xef\x80\xb4Using SERVIR\xe2\x80\x99s previous skills and expertise in Natural Resource\nManagement mapping and applying these
