b'WHYS AND HOWS OF IN-HOUSE WRITING\nJohn C. Lane\nEthyl Corporation Research Laboratories, Detroit\n\nI regret that I must write my contribution to this panel rather than\nparticipate in person, This is particularly regrettable because I have not\nhad the opportunity to hear the related panel this morning and the present\npanelis other participants this afternoon. Thus, I may overlap or seem to\nignore important points made in both panels. If so, please excuse me\nit\nwill be inadvertent.\n\n--\n\nTo get as much into the spirit of this discussion a s i s possible from\n1200 miles away, I\'ve studied the abstracts submitted by the panel\'s other\nmembers. F r o m time to time, 1\'11 comment on some of their ideas.\n\nI suppose there\'s no maxim that doesn\'t have an invalidating exception. Nevertheless, Iim going to advance one formulated by the late Norman\nShidle years ago, when he was editor of the SAE Journal, The SAE, of course,\ni s the Society of Automotive Engineers\nwhich, although engineers arenit\nsupposed to be able to write, has long managed to be articulate, if not literate.\n\n--\n\nNorm\'s maxim is, and I quote verbatim: "Clear thinking must precede clear writing. " He maintained, and so do I, that the best writer in the\nworld can\'t write clearly about something he doesn\'t clearly understand.\nWe can combine the requisite technical knowledge with the requisite\nwriting ability in only two ways.\n1.\n2.\n\n-\n\nWe can teach engineers to write, o r\nWe can teach writers to engineer.\n\nO the two, I believe it i s easier to teach engineers to write.\nf\nI do.\n\nSo that\'s what\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that in-house courses a r e not the only way to\naccomplish the task. The earlier you catch the little devils, the better the\ntraining will stick. And that, I believe, is part of the reason why so much\nin-house training i s needed today. The job just didn\'t get done earlier.\n\nGrammar-school teachers, years ago, used diagraming and syntax\nto teach coherent sentence building. They also taught their little charges to\n\noutline before starting to write. To some extent, anyway, the outlining step\nprovided the clear thinking that must precede c l e a r writing.\nThen came the progressive, free-expression, e r a that believed one\nway i s a s good a s another. Reading was taught by the look/say, whole-word\nmethod. Students could no longer sound out a written word to determine if\nthey had heard it before. As a r e s e a r c h professor at Georgia Tech in the\ne a r l y 1950s, I had graduate students working f o r me who couldn\'t recognize\nthe names of chemicals that they could step into the lab and synthesize with\nease,\nHigh- school English teachers largely ignored composition, because\nstudy of contemporary writing styles was more fun - and a great deal e a s i e r\n- - t o teach. "Me now, I just wanna be a catcher in the rye o r a l o r d of flies. l1\n\n-\n\nCollege composition courses were taught by English teachers on the\nLiberal A r t s side of the university. Matriculating engineers were given qualas,\nifying t e s t s that might opt them out of such tltime-wastingtl courses\nindeed, I was.\n\n--\n\nIn those days, the saying was: "Writers a r e born, not made. l1 And,\nI submit, that was because few teachers, if any, knew how to make a writer.\nThen, in the 1940s, two curious men asked what makes writing clear\no r unclear? Why do some writers make even simple ideas hard to understand? And why can others make very complex ideas reasonably understandable even to laymen?\nOne of the questioners was an Austrian refugee, Rudolf Flesch, who\ncame to this country not knowing how to speak o r write English. He taught\nhimself how to speak by going to the movies and matching the visual action\nwith the sound track. In other words, he learned the English language the\nby osmosis. He literally absorbed it\nsame way a l l of us h e r e learned it\nwhich i s no small t r i c k when youlre already grown up.\n\n--\n\n--\n\nThe other questioner was Robert Gunning, who went to work for a\nColumbus, Ohio, newspaper after being graduated f r o m Ohio State University.\nAs a r e p o r t e r whose writing was extraordinarily clear, he was asked to contribute items to a most unusual new newspaper. It was named "My Weekly\nReader," and its a i m wasto bringworldwide news to junior-highstudents and,\nthereby, stimulate their desire to read\nin other words, to give them something to read above the Dick-and- Jane o r Bobbsey Twins level.\n\n--\n\nA few newsmel?, like Robert Gunning, could write clearly for teens\nand subteens. But most could not. Gunning wondered why not. In another\n\npart of the country, and f r o m different background and experience, so did\nRudolf Fle s ch.\nWithin a year o r so of each other, both men developed readability\nindexes. They analyzed the parameters that make writing unnecessarily complex. Because of its simplicity and i t s computer-proved relationship to the\nyears of schooling required to read with comprehension, Gunning\'s Fog Index\nformula has been more widely adopted than F l e s c h f s formula. In fact, it has\nbecome a very useful yardstick f o r determining whether a piece of writing i s\nunnecessarily complex.\nDo sentences ramble on and on, without the pause of a comma o r\nperiod, so that the initial idea i s forgotten before the final idea i s proposed?\nTo avoid this, Gunning made average sentence length a prime parameter in\nhis Fog Index.\nThe other prime parameter is use of unfamiliar, complex words.\nWhy, a s Mark Twain said, write "metropolis" when I get paid the same for\ncalling it "city1\'? The same, of course, goes for "approximately" versus\n"aboutu; "characterize" f o r "describe "; "proximate" for "near "; "diminution" for "drop" o r "decrease"\nand any number of other multisyllabic\npomposities for more familiar synonyms.\n\n--\n\nSome people write to i m p r e s s rather than express.\nshows through, and the impression is unimpressive.\n\nUsually, this\n\nOne of Gunning\' s ten principles of clear writing i s "Relate the complex t o the simple. " An example might be electric voltage and current, which\nnobody can s e e , to water pressure and water flow. If one wants t o express\nhow large a "black holew in space may originally have been, he might t r y\ncomparing it with the diameter of the sun, which a l l of us s e e every day.\n0, there a r e many ways of teaching writing. And I maintain that\nmost of them have been ignored in recent years by English teachers trying to\neducate the scientifically oriented people who will develop andguide our technological progress in years to come. That\'s really not the English teachers1\nbag, and they probably shouldn\'t be saddled with it.\n\nSo who should do the job? Lf it hasn\'t been done before the graduates\na r e cast out into r e a l life, then business and industry must supply what the\neducational system has not.\nThat, very briefly, i s the case for in-house training.\nt o r s haven\'t done the job, the employers must.\n\nIf the educa-\n\nOut of my own company\'s need in the early 1950s, I sought out Robert\nGunning a t a hotel symposium he was conducting in Cleveland, Ohio. Hundreds came, one o r two men p e r company, to take Gunning\'s one-day course\ni n major metropolitan a r e a s around the country.\nWhat we wanted at our Laboratories was to t r a i n s c o r e s of r e s e a r c h e r s to report their results clearly and concisely. At two o r three hundred\ndollars a r e s e a r c h e r , in the hotel format, that would have taken y e a r s and\ncost a fortune.\nSo we asked Gunning if he would come to Detroit and give his course\nin-house to a l l of our people who needed to communicate in writing. He\nagreed, and together we s e t up what was either the f i r s t o r one of the f i r s t\nof his in-plant courses.\nOver the years, we came to realize that Fog Index and the Gunning\nten principles of clear writing still left us somewhat short of truly effective\ncommunication.\n\n--\n\nsomething Gunning\nOne major problem was thought organization\ndidn\'t much consider. An important corollary was determining the p r i m a r y\naudience and i t s particular needs and non-needs. To whom a r e you writing\nand why? What do they already know? What more do they need to know?\nHow do I best relate what they nked to know to what they already know? And\nhow do I avoid confusing them by telling them m o r e than they need to know?\nThese a r e questions, I believe, that most college and univer sity people have not asked themselves. Therefore, we employers have been forced\nto a s k ourselves. The results have been in-plant training courses. We don\'t\ndo it to put English teachers out of work. We do it because the job hasn\'t\nbeen getting done.\nOne problem has been that the neophytes never bring the payoff bott o m line up front in the reports of their efforts. I think they got that way because of their education, not despite it. And the fault lies not with the English faculty, but with the technical faculty.\nConsider what a technical-faculty member looks f o r in his students\'\nreports. The prof probably has been assigning the same laboratory experiments to successive classes for years on end. His purpose i s to instill experimental abilities\nnot to obtain an answer he already knows. Therefore,\na s his students soon perceive, the way to get an A i s to report chronologically\nand in detail\nevery manipulative effort and technique employed, stepby-step, in conducting the experiment. At the end\nand only at the end\ndo you divulge the result.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\nThen the students graduate and a r e hired by result-oriented companies. Their abilities to conduct experiments and employ scientific techniques a r e tacitly assumed f r o m their degrees and resume\'s. Now the emphasis\ni s on results. The bottom line of their college reports now i s of top-line importance. Somebody, somewhere, has to convince them that the way t o e a r n\nan A has shifted 180 degrees. Of necessity, this part of their education has\nfallen to the industries and businesses that employ them. You can send them\nout to remedial courses, o r you can do the job in-house. Of the two alternatives, in-house usually i s better, faster, and cheaper.\nVery briefly, that\'s the case for in-house training. It supplies what\nhasn\'t been supplied by academia -- at least up to now. I think it can be supplied in school. But to do so, teachers a r e going to have to consider the r e a l life needs out there\nconsider what employers need and want, not what the\nfaculty h a s been awarding with A\'s.\n\n--\n\nThis leads m e to a s k where the snobbery that Mr. Ransome alludes\nto really lies. Is it in the engineer who i s unwilling to communicate, o r i s it\nin his\'writing mentor who believes the engineer can\'t communicate. Believing that engineers have hairy e a r s and suffer f r o m tunnel vision and intellect u a l snobbery is a g r o s s misinterpretation. Truth i s , they just don\'t suffer\nfools willingly. The savant who comes along and tells them they a r e saying\nit a l l wrong had better be s u r e he knows how to say it right. "Clear thinking\nmust precede clear writing.\nThat is why I believe that the teachers of technical writing should be\ntechnical people, themselves , preferably with working experience in industry\no r business. The training they provide must be user-oriented, need-oriented\nnot theory-oriented.\n\n--\n\nIn the abstract of his talk here today, Dr. Smith said the student\nshould be taught to use words precisely rather than quote "writing like he\ntalkst1unquote. Personally, I fail to s e e how, why, o r where those two techniques a r e mutually exclusive. A per son brought up in a home of reasonably\neducated parents learns to speak well before learning to write at all. And the\nc l e a r thinking that must precede clear writing i s done in the brain, not on\npaper.\nGunning\'s ten principles of clear writing include "Develop your vocabulary. l t The reason i s not so you can use the word "paradigmIt when you\nmean ttexample" o r lrrhinitis\'twhen you mean the common cold. Gunning believes that the more words you know, the more clearly and precisely you can\nthink. When you have completed the clear-thinking step, you then translate\nyour precise thoughts into the simplest, least complex verbiage for the broad-\n\nest, least specialized audience you wish to reach.\ni s , in itself, a kind of intellectual snobbery.\n\n... To do less than that\n\nEinstein once was asked f o r a thumb-nail explanation of the theory\nof relativity. His answer went something like this: "When a man sits on a\nhot stove, a minute seems like an hour. But when he sits on a swing with a\npretty girl, an hour seems like a minute. It all depends on where you are.\nThat1s relativity,\nWith that as an example, and in the interest of keeping things reasonably brief and to the point, I now conclude. I send you greetings and best\nwishes from Detroit, and I sincerely regret that I\'m not able to be with you\ntoday.\n\n'
