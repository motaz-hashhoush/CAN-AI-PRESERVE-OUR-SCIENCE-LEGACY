Technology and mission studies of a permanently manned, evolutionary Space Station have identified the need for automated and eventually some degree of autonomous systems operation. A Space Station power system will have a high degree of interaction with other onboard systems which will act as power loads. By examining the evolution of an operational power system from a systems viewpoint through increasing degrees of automation the system and technology requirements are identified for an evolutionary system.", "title": "Systems view of power systems autonomy", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T11:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850063248, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Anderson, J.
