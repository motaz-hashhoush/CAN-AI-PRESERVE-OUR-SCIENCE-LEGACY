The sequence indicates a successful application of geostationary satellite data for monitoring dynamic hydrologic\nconditions.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe National Environmental Satellite Service\n(NESS) has established five Satellite Field Services\nStations (SPSS) to interface with field users of NESS\nsatellite data. One of the functions of the SFSS is\nto provide environmental satellite data and related\nanalyses, interpretations, and services. The support\nprovided varies by station depending on the interests\nof its regional users. Since January 1975, the SFSS\nin Redwood City, California has participated in the\nNASA sponsored Snow Application Systems Verification\nTest (ASVT) by providing satellite imagery from the\nNOAA and SMS environmental satellites.\nIt seemed a reasonable progression, based on the\neffectiveness of meteorological film loops from SMS,\nto construct a similar registered sequence showing the\ntime-space variations of snowfields. A film "loop"\nconsists of a short piece of film spliced into one continuous movie, thereby allowing the same set of imagery\nto be seen over and over. A meteorological loop may\nshow imagery spanning several hours but a hydrologicaj.\nloop showing snow melt would have to cover a period of\nseveral months.\nThe idea of applying time-lapse techniques to hydrological phenomena is not new. Serebreny et al,\n1974, summarizes past applications of LANDSAT imagery\nto temporal studies.! For example the idea of monitoring snowline recession via sequential satellite imagery is presented. Unique in the hydrologic timelapse sequence presented here however is the source of\n\n187\n\n\\\n\\\n\ndata from which it has been constructed.\nThere are two reasons for constructing the loop.\nThe first is to document and display the capabilities\nof the SMS satellites for hydrologic applications.\nThe second reason is to show the character and rate of\nsnowline recession in the Sierra Nevadas during this\nmost recent snow melt season.\nSATELLITE AND SATELLITE DATA\n\nThe Synchronous Meteorological Satellites (SMS)\nnow in orbit are NASA-sponsored prototypes. Future\nsatellites in this series will be entirely NOAA-funded\nand will be designated Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES).\nThe SMS satellites are geostationary, their position with respect to the earth remains fixed. This\noccurs because the angular velocity of the satellites\nin their orbit is identical to that of the earth. The\nSMS-2 subpoint resides at the equator with a longitude\nof 115\xc2\xb0W; SMS-1 is at 75\xc2\xb0W. Both spacecraft are at an\naltitude of about 35,000 km.\nVisible and infrared data from SMS are provided\nby a Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR).\nImages are created through the horizontal spinning\nmotion (100 rpm) of the satellite and by vertical internal stepping of the scan mirror after each spin.\nEight identical visible sensors (0.55-0.75>um) are\naligned in a linear array so that they generate 8 scan\nlines per satellite rotation. This results in 1 km\nresolution at the satellite subpoint. In order to reduce the data volume, the visible sensor output can\nalso be combined in sets of 2, 4, or all 8 sensors.\nVisible channel imagery can then be selected with 1, 2,\n4, or 8 km resolution, respectively. Two identical\nand redundant infrared sensors (10.5-12.6 Aim) provide\n8 km resolution at nadir. More information on the\nVISSR can be found in references 2 and 3.\nAlthough SMS-2 produces an image of almost an entire hemisphere during each scanning cycle, geographical "sectors" of limited extend are normally extracted for local use. The data stream from the satellite is sectorized by computer and the appropriate\nimages distributed to the SFSS\'s. Sectors with 1 km\nresolution cover an area at nadir of approximately 22\nx 10^ km^ and were chosen for this study because they\ncontain maximum spatial resolution. A sample sector\nis shown in Figure 1.\nSMS viewing geometry produces imagery displayed in\nan unfamiliar cartographic projection. The display,\nsomewhat similar to a standard orthographic meridional\n\n188\n\nREPRODUClBlLnY\nORIGINAL PAGE\n\n189\n\nprojection, is identical to that produced by photographing a world globe. In this case, the camera has\nbeen replaced by the spacecraft. Related to this type\nof projection is a radial decrease in resolution. As\nthe distance from the satellite subpoint increases,\nthe earth is viewed more obliquely, such that the instantaneous field of view covers a larger area. This\npredictable decrease in resolution results in a value\nbetween 1 and 1.5 km for the center of the sector used\nin the film loop.\nThe quality of SMS imagery is affected by the\nmethod of transmission. The data is received from the\nsatellite at the NESS headquarters in Suitland, Maryland. There it is sectorized and transmitted to the\nvarious SPSS\'s over a conditioned C-5 telephone line.\nThere, the data are recorded photographically on 25 x\n25 cm high quality negatives, from which the imagery\nis produced. A qualitative comparison of SMS-2 images\nproduced at Suitland and Redwood City has indicated\nthat a slight loss in sharpness occurs over the line.\nHowever, areal snow cover measurements from these images showed little difference.\nMETHOD\nArea Selection\nSeveral items were considered immediately before\nthe data collection period. First, sector location\nhad to be specified and was subsequently chosen to include three of the four westernmost study areas in the\nASVT project, namely, the Pacific Northwest, the Sierra\nNevadas, and the Salt and Verde River watersheds in\nArizona. The sector chosen is centered at 38\xc2\xb0N, 115\xc2\xb0W\nas shown in Figure 1. Based on other operational requirements , it was decided that one sector per day\ncould be allocated to the effort thus establishing the\nsampling frequency. Also, it was decided to request\nthe sector at about the same time each day, 2200 GMT\n(Table 1). This was done to minimize day-to-day sun\nangle variations and to reduce sector subpoint changes\ndue to diurnal extra-orbital motion.\nIt became apparent that an entire sector would\nprovide too much information when constructing the\nfinal loop. Consequently, one of the three ASVT study\nareas included in the daily sector was selected for\nconstructing the final sequence. Cloud cover during\nthe data collection period made the choice simple. The\nSierra Nevadas were completely or partially cloudfree\nat least 65% of the time (Table 1). Other factors also\ninfluenced our decision. First, the large areal extent\n\n190\n\nof snow in this region made its selection appealing.\nSecond, snow can be viewed directly over much of this\nrange because of the high percentage of unforested\nareas.\nLoop Construction\nIn constructing the loop, images were pin-registered using prepunched plastic strips taped to each\nnegative. Each negative was overlaid on a reference\nnegative (May 11) throughout the sequence; Mono Lake\nwas the primary geographic reference point.\nA number of problems were encountered during the\nconstruction of the loop. Initially two questions\narose. First, should days when clouds obscured the\nSierras be included? Second, what should be done\nabout dates during the sequence when negatives were\nnot obtained? The first question was easily answered\xe2\x80\x94\nyes. If cloud-cover statistics during the data collection period were to be of interest, and it was felt\nthey would, then days with and without clouds should\nbe included. The second problem was not serious inasmuch as only three days out of 60 were missing. It\nwas decided to assemble the loop without the missing\ndates and not to fill the gaps with adjacent negatives.\nThe major problem in loop construction related to\nimage-to-image brightness variations. An attempt has\nbeen made to minimize these brightness variations by\nfirst measuring individual negative densities, and\nthen compensating photographically while explosing the\nnegatives. This was partially successful, but could\nnot correct for differences in contrast.\nA minor problem in loop construction dealt with\nproper animation. Initially each image was exposed on\nfour frames as is customarily done with meteorological\nloops. At a nominal film speed of 16 frames per second, each day was presented on the screen for 1/4 second. This motion, however, was too rapid and 10 frames\nper day were selected for the final construction.\nThe final product is a 16mm film loop containing\n57 images over a period of 60 days. The first and\nlast images are repeated 20 times with the intervening\nimages repeated 10 times each. The entire loop is\nthus 590 frames in length, compressing two months of\nSierra Nevada snow melt into about 37 seconds.\nDISCUSSION\nThe film loop starts on May 10. and terminates on\nJuly 8, 1975. The dates are included in the upper\nrighthand corner of each frame. In viewing the loop,\n\n191\n\nit is recommended that subareas or basins within the\nSierras be selected for scrutiny. Considerable concentration is required. Cloud motion is very distracting and changes in snow cover are often not obvious.\nFigure 2 illustrates major river basins of the\nSierras covering the same area and in the same cartographic projection as the satellite imagery. A film\nloop cannot of course, be included in the text. Figure 3, however contains a selected sequence of eight\nimages taken from the loop and illustrates the pattern of snow melt.\nOver the 60 day period of the loop, a gradual recession of the dendritic snow envelope is apparent.\nHowever, during the period of the loop, significant\nsnow accumulation occurred on at least three separate\noccasions, May 21-22, June 17, and June 24. New snow\nmay be detectable following the June 17 snowfall. Unfortunately, the radiances of snow and cloud tops in\nthe visible band are often almost identical making a\ndistinction between the two nearly impossible. Cloud\ncontamination was especially troublesome following the\nJune 17 snowfall when trying to detect the presence of\nnew snow.\nThe original idea for generating a snow melt film\nloop did not occur until the first week in May. It\nwas indeed fortunate that snow melt was delayed this\nyear by cooler than normal weather throughout April\nand into early May. Field data confirmed that maximum\nsnow accumulation was delayed this year and occurred\naround the first week in May. This date for maximum\naccumulation was at least a month later than usual.4\nThus, more by good fortune than planning, we were able\nto capture that period when maximum snow melt occurred.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe purpose for constructing a film loop of snow\nmelt over the Sierra Nevadas has been to demonstrate\nthe applicability of SMS-2 one kilometer visual-band\nimagery to the study of snow cover dynamics. With\nthis time lapse sequence, the character and rate of\nsnow line recession in the Sierra Nevadas during the\n1975 snow melt season has been shown.\nThe Sierra Nevadas, during spring, are a subject\nwell suited to satellite surveillance.\nStatistics\nfrom Table 1 indicate that the Sierra Nevadas were\ntotally obscured by clouds only seven percent of the\ntime and partially cloud covered one-third of the time.\nCloud cover climatology indicates that this area is\ngenerally favorable for viewing from space during the\nspring season.5\n\n192\n\n193\n\nCM\n\nFIGURE 3 - SEOUENCE OF SNS-2 IMAGES OVER THE SIERRA NEVADAS\n\n194\n\nThe SMS satellites, 1 and 2, have the ability to\nview the earth from a fixed vantage point as well as\nprovide imagery every one-half hour. This combination\nat 1 km resolution provides the hydrologist with a\nunique surveillance capability. Useful applications of\nthis capability are far more numerous than merely constructing a film loop. Several examples follow.\n1. Areas having an early morning fog or mist,\nsuch as the Pacific Northwest, are difficult to snowmap with current NOAA or LANDSAT data. Cloudfree SMS\nimagery, however, can often be obtained in the afternoon (Schneider, 1975).6 In fact, imagery of a particular basin can be obtained if the area is cloudfree\nfor only half an hour per day.\n2. The daily snow melt rate may be computed. In\nareas of rapid snow melt, such as the Southwest, hourly snow melt rates can be determined.\n3. An immediate, daily record of cloud seeding\neffects on both cloud shape and snowfall can be obtained.\n4. Time-lapse analysis on an hourly scale can\nassist in snow/cloud discrimination.\n5. Selection of optimum solar zenith angle for\nindividual watersheds is possible. Basins facing west\nshould be imaged after solar noon, for example, to\nminimize valley wall shadows. Similarly, the solar\nangle could be selected which would minimize forest\nshadows to assist in detecting snow in forested areas.\nHalverson and Smith (1974) have published tables of\nshadow lengths as a function of time which would be\nhelpful.7\n6. Middleton et al (1952) have studied snowpack\nreflection at various zenith angles.8 Their results\nindicate it may be possible to differentiate among\nsnowpack surface conditions in early morning or late\nafternoon imagery.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude\nto Mr. Vince Leech for spending many hours in the\nphotographic lab constructing the film loop.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nSerebreny, S.M., W.E.
