b'Reconstruction of Ares I-X Integrated Vehicle Rollout Loads\nDr. Matthew K. Chamberlain1 and Dr. Steven R. Hahn2\nDynamic Concepts, Inc., Huntsville, AL 35806, USA\n\nThe measurements taken during the Ares I-X test flight provided a unique opportunity to\nassess the accuracy of the models and methods used to analyze the loads and accelerations\npresent in the planned Ares I vehicle. During the rollout of the integrated vehicle from the\nVehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to the launch pad, the vehicle and its supporting structure\nare subjected to wind loads and the vibrations produced by the crawler-transporter (CT)\nthat is carrying it. While the loads induced on the vehicle during this period are generally\nlow relative to those experienced in flight, the rollout is a period of operation of primary\ninterest to those designing both the ground support equipment and the interfaces between\nthe launch vehicle and its supporting structure. In this paper, the methods used for\nreconstructing the loads during the rollout phase are described. The results generated are\ncompared to measured values, leading to insight into the accuracy of the Ares I assessment\ntechniques.\n\nNotice to readers:\nThe predicted performance and certain other features and characteristics of the Ares I and Ares I-X\nlaunch vehicles are defined by the U.S. Government to be Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU).

Introduction & Background\n\nhe Ares I-X developmental test flight on October 28, 2009 was\nmeant as a demonstration of the characteristics and handling of\nthe future Ares I crew launch vehicle (CLV). As a part of the\nConstellation program under development by of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (NASA), the two-stage\nAres I booster would be used to place the Orion spacecraft in orbit\nfor missions to the International Space Station (ISS) as well as the\nlunar surface. The Ares I-X vehicle was heavily instrumented\nduring and prior to its flight, providing invaluable data to the teams\ninvolved in the ongoing design-analysis cycle for Ares I. This\npaper describes how data collected prior to the launch of Ares I-X\nwas used in validating and improving the analysis methods used to\nassess loads during the rollout of future Ares I vehicles.\nPrior to launch from launch complex 39 at the Kennedy Space\nCenter (KSC) in Florida, launch vehicles must be transported from\nthe Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to either of the two launch\npads more than three miles away by a crawler-transporter (CT)\nFigure 1. Ares I-X at End of Rollout.\nvehicle as shown in Fig. 1. The CT picks up both the vehicle and\nthe platform that supports it: either a Multiple Launcher Platform (MLP) in the case of the Space Shuttle and Ares IX or a Multiple Launcher (ML) in the case of Ares I. The as-yet incomplete ML differs from the MLP in that it\nincludes a large tower and two stabilizing arms that would restrain an Ares I vehicle from the point at which it is\nstacked up until launch.\nThe phase of operation from the point at which the CT lifts the vehicle up in the VAB to the point at which it\nlowers them at the launch pad is the focus of this paper. The launch vehicle itself is not expected to experience peak\nloads or moments during the rollout phase of operations, however prior analysis has suggested that attention be paid\nto the points at which the launch vehicle and the ML or MLP are in contact. Of particular concern in the rollout\nanalysis are the following quantities:\n\xef\x82\xb7 The axial loads on the hold-down posts (HDP) on the ML or MLP which support the weight of the launch\nvehicle. To ensure stability and the orientation of the vehicle at launch, it is important to ensure that the\nvehicle never becomes unseated from a HDP.\n\xef\x82\xb7 The loads present in the aft skirt of the first stage of the vehicle where it is in contact with the HDPs.\n\xef\x82\xb7 The loads present in the stabilizer arms that connect the Ares I vehicle to the ML tower. These structures\nwere not present for the rollout of Ares I-X.\nDuring the rollout of Ares I-X, over eight hours of acceleration and strain time histories were recorded at key\npoints on the MLP and the vehicle itself. Many of the same methods utilized in a typical Ares I analysis cycle were\nreused in an attempt to reconstruct the loads measured. The information provided by this exercise has proved\nvaluable in validating the modeling methods, simulation techniques, and conservatism of the typical Ares I rollout\nanalysis procedure. In Section II of this paper, the approach used to model the MLP and Ares I-X during rollout is\ndescribed. In The procedure used to simulate rollout is explained n Section III while the results and the implications\nof those results are discussed in Sections IV and V respectively.\n\nII. Modeling and Boundary Conditions\nThe finite element models of the MLP and Ares I-X used in this reconstruction Craig-Bampton reduced order\nrepresentations produced by NASA. The Ares I-X model had 536 physical and 966 generalized modes while the\nMLP had 363 physical and 966 generalized modes. The vehicle was assumed to be pinned to the MLP at the four\nHDPs. Stiff springs with were applied to all three translational degrees of freedom at the HDPs to serve as a penalty\nfunction for violating the constraint that the vehicle sit still on the HDPs. This stiffness value was specified to\nprovide the minimum stiffness necessary to adequately enforce the constraint while avoiding introducing any illconditioning through loss of precision and round-off error.\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe combined MLP and vehicle model stiffness matrices (already reduced using the Craig-Bampton method)\nwere assembled as follows:\n(1)\n(2)\nPrior to being picked up by the CT inside the VAB for rollout, the Ares I-X vehicle was stacked on top of an\nMLP which itself was supported at six points, as shown in Fig. 2. Supports at the same six points were used at the\nlaunch pad after rollout. While modeling the effects of gravity before and during crawler pickup (see Section III),\nthe combined model was grounded at these six points using very stiff springs. Prior to rollout, the CT was moved\ninto position below the MLP and raised using four sets of jacking, elevation, and lifting (JEL) cylinders. Thus, as it\nwas carried by the CT, the combined structure of the MLP and the launch vehicle were supported at four points (see\nFig. 2). As discussed in Section III, triaxial accelerometers at the top of the JEL cylinders, just below the interface\nbetween the CT and the MLP measured base drive accelerations used in the simulation to drive the combined model.\nLacking sufficient models of the CT and the behavior of the JEL cylinders, the dynamics of the CT were not\nconsidered in this work.\n\nFigure 2. Measurement Locations on MLP and Ares I-X.\n\nIII. Method\nThe methods used for modeling and simulating the rollout of Ares I-X are similar to those used to analyze Ares I\nduring a loads cycle but with one key difference. Whereas in a loads cycle, the combined finite element model of the\nML and Ares I are subjected to worst-on-worst combinations of gravity, crawler base drive, and wind loading, Ares\nI-X is assumed here to be subject to the measured base drive and gravity alone. During the early phases of rollout,\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nwinds were low enough that this was thought to be a safe assumption. Also, during a loads cycle, loads\ntransformation matrices are utilized to derive loads throughout the vehicle. With only a few points on the vehicle\ninstrumented during the Ares I-X rollout, only a few values were derived directly from the dynamic responses of the\nsystem.\nThe key steps in the reconstruction of the Ares I-X rollout thus were the processing of measured data, the\nsimulation of the effects of base drive accelerations, correction for overturning moment in the vehicle, and\nsimulation of the effects of gravity and the changing boundary conditions on the MLP. These steps are described in\nthe three subsections that follow.\nA. Processing of Measured Data\nThree sets of data are utilized in this reconstruction effort. Accelerations in three directions at each of the four\nMLP/CT interface points (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) are used to simulate the base drive from the crawler. Strain readings\non the HDPs and accelerations measured at Station A (see Fig. 2) were used to validate the simulated results.\nWith over eight hours of rollout data available, a subset of time had to be selected for study. Because initial\ninspection of strain readings in the hold-down posts suggested high loads when the crawler slowed down to cross\nroads, it was judged desirable to study a portion of the rollout that included at least one slow-down period and one\nsteady speed period. Previous loads analysis cycles for Ares have shown that when winds are low, their impact on\nthe overall loads on the vehicle and MLP are negligible compared to that of the base drive. This fact made it\ndesirable to study a period of time in which winds were low.\n\nFigure 3. Crawler Transporter Showing JEL Cylinder and MLP/CT Interfaces.\nWind data from the corner of the MLP (measurement and crawler velocity data from GPS readings are plotted in\nFig. 4. Inspection of this figure shows that winds were quite low during much of the first half of the rollout of Ares\nI-X. Winds suddenly began picking up around the 10,000 sec mark. The CT had to slow down twice before this\npoint because two road crossings. For this reason, a time period between 3,500 sec and 10,000 sec was selected for\nstudy in this reconstruction effort. This time period represents over 108 minutes of data \xe2\x80\x93slightly more than the\nlength of time studied in previous Ares I loads analysis cycles.\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 4. Crawler Velocity and Wind Speed During Rollout.\nThe accelerations due to the base drive at the MLP/CT interface for the Ares I-X rollout were measured in G\xe2\x80\x99s at\n100 Hz using a series of twelve accelerometers numbered KSRDG301A through KSRDG312A. Filtering the base\ndrive accelerations for use in driving the finite element models of the structure presented a challenge since the\nnominal noise floor of the accelerometers exceeded the first two bending modes of the structure. This fact is\ndemonstrated in a power spectral density (PSD) plot of the Z-axis accelerations at one of the MLP/CT attach points\nin blue and the extrapolated noise floor for the accelerometer in green in Fig. 5. The interaction of these two lines\nabove the second bending mode throws doubt on the readings for the accelerometer at the values of the first two\nbending modes. Indeed, the general trend of the PSD at frequencies beyond this point can be seen to run parallel to\nthe extrapolated noise floor.\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 5. Measured MLP/CT Interface Z-Acceleration.\nBecause of the importance of the first two modes and the doubt surrounding the accelerometer readings around\nthose frequencies, a scaled Tukey Window1 filtering approach was used on the raw measured data. This approach\nwas meant to allow in some, but not all of the low frequency signals and is computed as follows:\n\nnoise, n \xef\x82\xb5 f\nsignal, s \xef\x82\xb5 f\n\n\xef\x80\xad\xef\x81\xa1\n\n\xef\x81\xa2\n\ngrows with smaller frequencies\n\ndecreases with smaller frequencies\n\xef\x81\xa7\n\n\xef\x83\xa6 f \xef\x83\xb6\n\xef\x83\xb7\n\xef\x83\xa7\n\xef\x81\xa2\n\xef\x83\xa7 f \xef\x83\xb7\ns\nf\n0\xef\x83\xb8\n\xef\x83\xa8\n\xef\x80\xbd\nscale \xef\x80\xbd\n\xef\x82\xb5\n(3)\n\xef\x81\xa2\n\xef\x81\xa7\n\xef\x80\xad\xef\x81\xa1\ns\xef\x80\xabn\n\xef\x80\xab f\nf\n\xef\x83\xa6 f \xef\x83\xb6\n\xef\x83\xb7\n1\xef\x80\xab \xef\x83\xa7\n\xef\x83\xa7 f \xef\x83\xb7\n0\xef\x83\xb8\n\xef\x83\xa8\nwhere \xce\xb3 is the power that controls how quickly the scaling drops off at low frequencies and f0 is the frequency at\nwhich the scaling factor is \xc2\xbd.

Tukey Noise Reduction Factor.\n\nThe noise floor was judged to not be as great of a concern for the accelerometers placed at two points on the\nvehicle during rollout. As seen in Fig. 7, the apparent noise floor of the signal seen at these two locations exceeds\nthe projected noise floor of the accelerometers in the frequency range near the first two bending modes. The\nexample plot shown in Fig. 7 is illustrative of trends seen in the other cardinal directions at both of the accelerometer\nlocations. Because these accelerometer signals seemed clean in the ranges important for modal analysis of the\nsystem, the signals were filtered using a simple high-pass filter.\n\nFigure 7. Measured Z-Direction Acceleration PSD at Station A.\nB. Base Drive Simulation\nBecause of the time period selected for reconstruction the only source of excitation of the combined MLP/Ares IX finite element model are the base drive accelerations applied at the MLP/CT connection points. In order to\nsimulate the effects of the base drive, the measured and filtered accelerations must be integrated twice to create time\nhistories for the displacements and velocities of the connection points.\n\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe next step in the analysis procedure is to identify the degrees of freedom associated with the MLP/CT\ninterface points and separate them in the mass and stiffness matrices. For instance, the stiffness matrix can be\nseparated as follows:\n(4)\nWhere K22 are the DOF\xe2\x80\x99s of the crawler attach points where the base drive acceleration is being applied and K11\nare the remaining un-driven DOF\xe2\x80\x99s in the model. This leads to the equation of motion for rollout:\n(5)\nWhere\nis the known, measured acceleration that is driving the ML/CLV at the crawler attach points.\nare the velocity and displacement at the attach points as calculated from the integration of the\nLikewise,\nis the modal damping matrix, which is discussed in greater detail at the end of this subsection.\nacceleration.\nSince measured accelerations are applied at the crawler attach points, there is no damping at these points\nrendering\n,\n, and\nessentially zero.\nIn previous Ares loads cycles, the equations of motion for the system were solved using an enforced\ndisplacement technique based on the known behavior at the MLP/CT interfaces and a conversion of the equations of\nmotion into modal coordinates. To simplify the solution process, a Craig-Bampton transformation2 was used in the\nAres I-X reconstruction effort. This transformation is used to decouple the known drive points from the rest of the\ndegrees of freedom in the stiffness matrix. The Craig-Bampton transformation is given by,\n(6)\nwhere the Craig-Bampton transformation matrix (\n\n) is given by,\n(7)\n\nwhere are the fixed boundary modes of the system and are the constraint modes of the system. In addition,\nat this point the constraint modes are limited to those under 30 Hz. All of the physical velocities and accelerations\ncan be converted using the Craig-Bampton transformation matrix in the same manner shown in Equation 7.\nRearranging the equations of motion using the Craig-Bampton transformation yields the following:\n(8)\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(9)\nThus the generalized responses can be found using the measured base drive accelerations alone. However, the\naccelerations must be integrated to determine the loads due to the constraint modes. Damping is not shown in\nEquations 8 or 9 but was included in the simulation used for reconstruction of Ares I-X data. The entire system was\nassumed to be critically damped. In previous Ares I load cycles, the critical damping has been assumed to be twice\nwhat was used here but the lower value yielded more accurate reconstructed values for Ares I-X. The equations of\nmotion were integrated using a 4th order Runge Kutta equation to find the modal displacements and velocities.\nPhysical displacements, velocities, and accelerations were calculated based on their modal counterparts.\nC. Overturning Moment Compensation\nAn overturning moment is created on a long, slender vehicle like Ares I-X when the force of gravity is not\ncollinear with the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s longitudinal axis. This effect occurs when the base drive acceleration loadings cause\nlarge lateral bending deflections of the structure, pushing the center of mass out of line and creating a resulting\nmoment. An adjustment to the system stiffness matrix to account for this effect was included in all of the response\ncomputations.\nD. Gravity Effects During Crawler Pickup\n\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is not included in the main rollout base drive reconstruction for Ares I-X on\naccount of the fact that the measured accelerometer data has been adjusted to remove it. A separate study of the\nloading due to gravity during the process of picking up the MLP and Ares I-X up off of the columns in the Vehicle\nAssembly Building (VAB) was carried out. Gravity loads are first found with the MLP/Ares I-X model grounded at\nthe six pad/VAB support columns. The displacements at the column degrees of freedom are then cancelled using\nforces applied in the direction opposite of gravity. Finally, gravity is applied to the combined model when supported\nat the four MLP/CT attach points. The total displacements are added up to yield loads due to gravity. One of the\ninteresting findings of this study of the changes in boundary conditions during pickup is that because of the spacing\nbetween the various support points, the MLP deflects under the weight of Ares I-X in one direction while supported\nin the VAB, then in a different direction when supported by the crawler as shown in Fig. 8.\n\nFigure 8. Exaggerated Changes in Boundary Conditions During Crawler Pickup.\n\nIn a normal analysis cycle for Ares I, wind loads on the vehicle and ML due to ground wind gust, vortex\nshedding, and locked-in wind-induced oscillation are modeled. As mentioned earlier, separate analysis not\ndiscussed here found that the peak winds present during the Ares I-X rollout did produce discernable but very small\nloads on the vehicle. For this reason, the wind loads have not been included in this analysis.\n\nIV. Results\nThe Ares I-X rollout process was simulated for the 6,500 second time period described in Section III-A using the\nanalysis procedures described in III-B. The key metrics for judging the validity of the simulated results come from\nthe measured values of HDP loads as well as accelerations, velocities, and displacements at two points on the\nvehicle where accelerometers were located. As summarized in Table 1, the simulation results agree quite closely\nwith measured data, particularly in the RMS values when the tapered filtering is used on the base drive acceleration\ninputs. The displacements at the higher accelerometer (Station A) are particularly accurate.\n\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nTable 1.

The transducer noise that masks low frequency signals may be responsible for some of the\ndifferences between simulated and measured values. It should be noted that the operational Ares I vehicle should\nless sensitive to low frequency excitation when stabilized through attachment to the new ML tower. Some of the\nlarger features of the axial HDP loads can be seen and the magnitude of the peak response and RMS level are on par\nwith what was measured. In the measured results, there are \xe2\x80\x9cblooms\xe2\x80\x9d of loading around changes in CT speed. These\ncan be seen in slightly lest distinct spikes in the simulated results.\n\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 9. Hold-Down Post 5 Axial HDP Load Time Histories (Y Scales of Plots are Identical).\n\nThe power spectral density for the axial hold-down post loads at Post 5 are plotted in Fig. 10 and show that the\nsimulated results generally closely capture the statistics of the measured values. The primary bending frequencies\nfound using the simulation are a bit lower than their measured values but their magnitudes are similar. The effect of\nhigh-pass tapered filtering on the simulated responses is clearly seen in the lower PSD values at low frequencies.\n\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 10.\n\nHold-Down Post 5 Axial HDP Load Time PSDs.\n\nThe simulated accelerations in the Z-direction at the higher of the two accelerometers are qualitatively very\nsimilar to those that were measured, as seen in Fig. 11. The two responses are similar both in RMS and peak values.\nThe PSD plot in Fig. 12 shows that the frequency content of these two responses is also similar at levels below 7 Hz.\nJust as with the HDP axial loads, the peaks in the PSD plot are lower for simulated values than for measured values\nand the effects of the high-pass filtering can again be clearly seen in the simulated results.\n\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 11.\n\nZ-Acceleration Time Histories at Station A (Y Scales of Plots are Identical).\n\nFigure 12.\n\nZ-Acceleration PSDs at Station A.\n\n13\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe displacements at Station A show less qualitative similarities the accelerations but peak and RMS values are\nin good agreement as seen in Fig 13. Some of the differences between the measured and simulated displacements\nmay be the result of the poor characterization of the low frequency drive accelerations. The displacement PSD plot\nshown in Fig. 14 demonstrates that the simulation captures the magnitude of the primary bending mode well but\nreports a slightly lower frequency once again. The effects of the high-pass filtering are again show clearly.\n\nFigure 13.\n\nZ-Direction Accelerations Time Histories at Station A (Y Scales of Plots are Identical).\n\n14\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 14.\n\nZ-Direction Displacement PSDs at Station A.\n\nV. Discussion\nIt has been shown in this study that the Ares I simulation tools do conservatively estimate rollout loads when\nused to model Ares I-X. While not every detail of the time histories can be exactly produced, the trends and\nmagnitudes of the real loads seen while rolling out Ares I-X were accurately reconstructed with some margin of\nsafety. Hold-down post peak simulated values were roughly 20% higher than those measured while RMS values\nwere roughly 40% higher. Simulated acceleration values at Station A high up on the vehicle had both peak and RMS\nvalues only 5% higher than measured.\nIt is noted that the Ares I-X vehicle was different from the planned Ares I vehicle layout. It lacked a powered\nupper stage, Orion crew capsule, launch abort system (LAS), and the vibration damping systems meant to deal with\nthrust oscillation during flight. The first stage solid rocket booster was made up of four segments with a dummy\nupper fifth segment whereas the Ares I would have five segments filled with propellant. In addition to the\ndifferences in the vehicle itself, the support equipment used during rollout differs from that which will be used with\nAres I. The Ares I-X rollout made use of heritage equipment including a Mobile Launcher Platform (MLP) used in\nthe Space Shuttle program. While the structure of the crawler, MLP, and Ares I-X differs from the planned\noperational structure for Ares I during rollout, it is felt that the lessons learned from reconstructing the loads on a\nvehicle similar to Ares I far outweigh the uncertainties due to its dissimilarities.\nIt is also noted that the base drive accelerations used to drive the finite element models of Ares I-X on the MLP\nwere produced by accelerometers whose noise floors were too high to accurately capture important low-frequency\nsignals. These noise floors exceeded the first two bending modes of the combined Ares I-X/MLP model, meaning\nthat signals in that low range are tainted and likely lead to higher loads. This situation is particularly troublesome for\nAres I-X with its low-frequency modes. It is expected to be of less concern for Ares I as that vehicle will ride on a\nnew ML and will be stabilized at two points to an access tower. With the stabilization provided by the tower and two\narms, the Ares I bending modes will be above the noise floor of the accelerometers.\nThe results of this study have yielded increased confidence in the ability to use Ares I simulation and modeling\ntools to accurately but conservatively model vehicle loads during rollout. The results have also yielded slight\nchanges in both the modeling of critical damping and in the methods for simulating the base drive accelerations. The\nfiltered data gathered during the Ares I-X rollout will continue to be used in simulation of Ares I rollout loads in\nfuture loads cycles.\n15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n1\n\nReferences\n\nTukey, J.
