When the gravitational loading\nof the musculoskeletal system is removed, as in weightlessness,\none of the body\'s responses is muscle atrophy, particularly in the\nlegs and thighs. This is reflected by a reduction of muscle volume, mass, strength, exercise capacity, and neuromuscular coordination. Metabolic manifestations of disturbed protein turnover in\nthe muscles of space travelers include marginal or negative balances of nitrogen and potassium, as well as a persistent rise in\nurinary excretion of nitrogen, ammo acids, and 3-methylhistidine.\nAlthough there are no reports that muscle atrophy associated with space flight has compromised any manned mission to date,\ndecrements in strength, exercise capacity, and locomotor coordination have been observed after most manned space missions. Moreover, muscular deconditioning may have contributed to the tachycardia noted during extravehicular activity in the Gemini, Apollo,\nand Skylab programs and to the cardiac arrhythmias and marked\nfatigue experienced during lunar surface activities and return to\nEarth in the Apollo 15 mission. Full recovery of muscular strength\nfollowing space flights of medium (weeks) to long (months) duration requires from several days to several weeks. Data are not\navailable to show conclusively whether full recovery of muscle\nbulk takes place.\nIn the weightlessness of orbital flight, the functional\nload on the musculoskeletal system is insufficient to maintain\nnormal physiologic status of the musculature. There is no need\nfor muscular opposition to gravity or for maintaining terrestrial\nposture, and the effort needed to move about is greatly reduced.\nThe types of physical performance required of astronauts (except\nfor voluntary physical exercises) and the confined volume of their\nspacecraft contribute to a marked reduction of physical activity.\nWhether the muscle atrophy is caused by zero-G or a combination of\nfactors in the spacecraft environment has not been fully established, but weightlessness seems to be the dominant etiologic factor. Lack of production of customary muscular force in zero-G i^s\nprobably an important contributory factor, and deviations from\nnormal hormonal balances may influence muscle protein turnover.\nDaily regimens of vigorous physical exercises during\nspace missions are used by both U.S. and U.S.S.R. spacecrews as a\nmeans of counteracting muscle atrophy. Inflight diets are formulated to provide all required nutrients to maintain positive nitrogen and energy balance. In addition, Soviet inflight preventive\n\nmeasures include electrostimulation of muscles and wearing a\nmotion-resisting garment. However, despite these measures, skeletal muscle atrophy continues to progress during space flight,\nresulting in progressive loss of muscle and negative nitrogen\nbalance.\nAlthough scientific knowledge about the physiologic and\npathologic effects of use and "disuse" of skeletal muscle is abundant, there is still much to be learned. Lack of data on the\nbasic biologic mechanisms of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy hampers the quest for a solution to the problem of muscle atrophy in\nspace. Consequently, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) supports research on the basic mechanisms of muscle\natrophy and efficient methods of prevention or control. The present report is part of an effort by NASA to identify promising\nlines of research for future program planning. It is based upon a\nreview of available knowledge and the opinions and suggestions of\na group of expert investigators (the LSRO ad hoc Working Group on\nMuscle Atrophy) whose names are listed on page 81.\nThe report includes background information on muscle biology and atrophy, a review of muscle atrophy associated with actual\nand simulated space flight, and the findings of the ad hoc Group\nwith respect to important gaps in knowledge, desirable research\napproaches, and the present NASA research program on muscle atrophy. A majority of the participants concluded that acquisition of\nessential data from inflight measurements of spacecrew personnel\nis important for designing more meaningful ground-based and inflight experiments. Such measurements should be representative of\na typical day\'s activities. They would be practical, designed not\nto interfere with crew duties, and would assess muscle strength,\nvelocity of contraction, levels of electrical activity, and fatigability. The data would be compared with results of measurements\nof the same parameters in the same individuals in a typical day of\nground activity.\nSuggested approaches to determining basic mechanisms of\ndisuse atrophy involve studies of: (1) the effects on muscle protein turnover of altered tissue concentrations of and sensitivities to anabolic hormones such as growth hormone and the somatomedins; (2) promoters of muscle protein synthesis such as leucine,\nother branched chain amino acids, and their metabolites; (3) identification and characterization of the enzymes responsible for\nchanges in rates of muscle protein synthesis and degradation in\nresponse to unloading and relative inactivity; and (4) identification and test of inhibitors of muscle proteases. A major breakthrough would be discovery of the molecular stimuli that lead to\nchanges in rates of muscle protein synthesis and degradation in\nresponse to increased or decreased use of skeletal muscle.\n\nVI\n\nUse of the rat head-down suspension model for inducing\nhypokinesia and hypodynamia of the hind limbs has yielded experimental results on muscle atrophy similar to those derived from\nstudies inflight. While this is a good model for ground-based\nstudies, efforts should continue to develop and improve models for\nsimulating zero-G, including comparative studies of such methods\nas joint pinning, casting, paraplegia, denervation, and pharmacologic nerve block. Human patients with spinal cord injury might\nbe tested ethically to determine the minimum amount of electrically-induced exercise that would prevent muscle atrophy; data\nfrom such tests could be used in designing inflight exercises.\nTo acquire other data for improving inflight exercises,\npre- and postflight measurements of maximal voluntary contractions\nof selected muscle groups such as the flexors and extensors of the\narms and legs should be done on all personnel who participate in\nspace flights. Complementary ground-based studies in a model of\nhypokinesia/hypodynamia such as bed rest should be done with human\nsubjects to determine minimum amounts of strength or endurance\nexercises, or combinations of these, needed to prevent muscle atrophy. The role of eccentric contractions for maintaining muscle\nstrength and bulk in models of hypokinesia/hypodynamia should be\nexplored. Finally, more data are needed to settle questions\nrelated to optimal preflight physical fitness of space flyers.\nExamination of NASA\'s research on muscle atrophy indicates that it is a young, evolving program based on expert guidance received from multiple sources including formal scientific\nadvisory groups. Most studies in the Biomedical Research Program\non Muscle Atrophy are consistent with the governing program documents. However, future program planning should include refinement, if possible, of the research objectives and approaches and\ncloser matching of these with ongoing and planned research. The\nBiomedical Research Program on Muscle Atrophy is complemented by\nother valuable ground-based studies in the Space Biology Program\nand by muscle studies scheduled for Spacelab 4. Finally, the\nad hoc Working Group on Muscle Atrophy concluded that the research\nsuggestions in this report offer opportunities for future planning\nthat would enhance the likelihood of achieving NASA\'s objectives\nin muscle atrophy research.\n\nvii\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nPage\nForeword\nSummary\n\n1\n\nObjectives and Scope of the Study\n\n3\n\nAtrophy of Skeletal Muscle\n\n5\n\nNormal Muscle\n\n5\n\nMuscle function\n\n5\n\n2.\n\nIII.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\n\nII.\n\nv\n\nA.\n\nI.\n\niii\n\nEnergy metabolism in muscle\n\n7\n\nB.\n\n7\n\n1.\n\nDefinition\n\n7\n\n2.\n\nCauses of muscle atrophy\n\n8\n\n3.\n\nPrevention of muscle atrophy\n\n9\n\n4.\nIV.\n\nAtrophic Muscle\n\nRehabilitation\n\n12\n\nMuscle Atrophy Associated With\nManned Space Flight\n\n15\n\nA.\n\nNature and Occurrence\n\n15\n\nB.\n\nCountermeasures\n\n18\n\nIX\n\nPage\nV.\n\nObservations of the LSRO ad hoc Working Group\non Muscle Atrophy\nA.\n\nNature, Causes, and Mechanisms of\nMuscle Atrophy Associated with\nSpace Flight\n1.\n2.\n\nB.\n\n21\n\n21\n\nCauses of muscle atrophy in space\nflight\n\n22\n\nMechanisms\n\n24\n26\n\n1.\n\nNutrition\n\n26\n\n2.\n\nMetabolic changes\n\n26\n\n3.\n\nNeurophysiologic and\nkinesiologic aspects\n\n27\n\n4.\n\nEndocrine changes\n\n29\n\n5.\nC.\n\nSelected Physiologic Factors\n\nResearch suggestions\n\n30\n32\n\n1.\n\nMetabolic capacity\n\n33\n\n2.\nD.\n\nBiochemical Aspects\n\nResearch suggestions\n\n34\n35\n\n1.\n\nExercise\n\n35\n\n2.\n\nElectrical stimulation\n\n38\n\n3.\n\nOther approaches\n\n39\n\n4.\nE.\n\nCountermeasures\n\nResearch suggestions\n\n40\n\nModels\n\n41\n\n2.\n\nMethodology and equipment\n\n43\n\n3.\n\nG.\n\n41\n\n1.\n\nF.\n\nModels, Methodology, and Equipment\n\nResearch suggestions\n\n45\n\nThe NASA Research Program in\nMuscle Atrophy\n\n46\n\nConclusions\n\n52\n\nPage\nVI.\n\nReferences\n\n61\n\nCited References\n\n61\n\nB.\nVIII.\n\n55\n\nA.\n\nVII.\n\nSuggestions for Future Consideration\n\nUncited References\n\n79\n\nStudy Participants\n\n81\n\nXI\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the problems addressed by the Biomedical Research\nProgram of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nis the atrophy of skeletal muscles that occurs during space flight.\nNumerous observations of American and Soviet space travelers, animals flown in space, and subjects exposed to simulated weightlessness have generally demonstrated skeletal muscle atrophy. Associated effects include decreased muscle strength and reduced work\ncapacity (Pestov and Geratewohl, 1975). The biomedical results of\nthe Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs included several features\nin common that were referable directly or indirectly to skeletal\nmuscle effects: minimal to moderate loss of muscle nitrogen,\nweight loss, and postflight decrease in exercise tolerance\n(Dietlein, 1977). Similar effects have been reported by Soviet\nspace medical scientists (Gazenko et al., 1981).\nThe muscle atrophy experienced to date, in missions from\na few weeks to six months, has apparently not compromised crew\neffectiveness inflight and seems to be reversible following mission completion. Daily, vigorous exercises of the major muscle\ngroups appear to retard the muscle deconditioning; however, the\nreliability and effectiveness of exercises have not been adequately demonstrated from a scientific standpoint. In fact, some\nevidence suggests that, despite all measures at intervention that\nhave been attempted, muscle atrophy continues throughout orbital\nflight, featuring progressive loss of muscle mass and negative\nnitrogen balance (Whedon, 1982; Whedon et al., 1977).\nAlthough the muscle atrophy experienced to date by U.S.\nastronauts appears to have been innocuous inflight, it may have\ninterfered to an unknown degree with the physiologic efficiency of\nastronauts engaged in extravehicular activity including exploration of the lunar surface. Postflight, it contributes to a temporarily reduced state of physical fitness and orthostatic intolerance. In addition, leg volumes of astronauts are diminished upon\nreturn to Earth. Thus, space-related muscle atrophy represents a\nsignificant biomedical problem.\nNASA\'s quest for a solution to this problem is hampered\nby a lack of knowledge of the biologic mechanisms of muscle atrophy; hence, in a continuing effort to resolve the problem, NASA\nsupports intra- and extramural research ranging from basic studies\nto applied technology. Part of NASA\'s responsibility in management of research is to review and revise the research program\nperiodically in order to take advantage of new knowledge and\nexpert opinion. In connection with this process, NASA requested\nthat the Life Sciences Research Office (LSRO) of the Federation of\nAmerican Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) review and\n\nevaluate available knowledge and ongoing research and provide\nadditional scientific input for future research programming in\nmuscle atrophy. This has been done with the assistance of an\nad hoc Working Group of outstanding scientists, supplemented by\nother prominent investigators, who are identified in Section VIII\n\nII.\n\nOBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of the LSRO study of the problem of muscle\natrophy associated with space flight are:\n(1)\n\nto review extant knowledge of the subject;\n\n(2)\n\nto examine NASA\'s current and projected research\nprogram;\n\n(3)\n\nto identify all significant gaps in essential\nknowledge;\n\n(4)\n\nto formulate additional suggestions for future\nresearch consideration by NASA; and,\n\n(5)\n\nto produce a documented report of the foregoing\nitems that can be used for NASA research program\nplanning.\n\nWith respect to NASA\'s research and development in muscle\natrophy and methods of coping with the problem, the primary emphasis\nin this report is on the ground-based Biomedical Research Program\non Muscle Atrophy. However, the review includes pertinent information from NASA\'s Space Biology Program and the muscle experiments\nplanned for Spacelab 4. In addition, the report emphasizes the\nessential importance of acquiring as soon as possible, human data\non muscle physiology during all inflight opportunities, and suggests experiments that could be done with minimal encroachment\nupon the schedules of the spacecrews.\nThe scope of topics that were reviewed, as is indicated\nin the Table of Contents, covers the basic biologic disciplines,\ncertain clinical aspects, possible means of intervention, and the\nareas of models, methods, and equipment. The major portion of the\nreport (Section V) is devoted to the observations of the ad hoc\nWorking Group during their meeting at FASEB and their follow-up\ncontributions including critiques of the draft report.\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nATROPHY OF SKELETAL MUSCLE\n\nNORMAL MUSCLE\n\nOnly a small part of the literature in the broad field of\nskeletal muscle biology is cited in the following paragraphs.\nSome\nadditional sources that are not cited in the report are appended\nto the list of references (see p.79). Table 1 is an outline of\ncertain anatomic features of skeletal muscle. The muscles which\nare of primary concern in this study include most of the muscles\nof the lower extremities, the gluteal muscles, the trunk muscles,\nextensors of back and neck, and their antagonists.\n1.\n\nMuscle function\n\nThe sliding filament model is generally accepted as\nthe basic contractile system of striated muscle, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum and transverse tubular system, in concert with\nCa2"1", link neuromuscular excitation and muscle contraction (Fuchs,\n1974). The complex process of muscle contraction was outlined by\nFuchs (1974):\nBriefly, force generation is believed to result\nfrom the cyclic attachment and detachment of crossbridges projecting from the thick (myosin) filaments\nand interacting with the thin (actin) filaments in\nsuch a way as to draw them toward the center of the\nsarcomere. Cross-bridge activity is energetically\ncoupled to the splitting of adenosine triphosphate\n(ATP), catalyzed by the cross-bridges themselves,\nand is regulated by the (free) Ca2"1" concentration in\nthe sarcoplasm. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes contain an ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump which maintains the sarcoplasmic Ca2"1" concentration in resting\nmuscle at a level (<10~7M) below that needed for\nactivation of cross-bridge interaction. Upon stimulation, an electrical signal is transmitted along\nthe transverse tubules (T-tubule) to the terminal\ncisternae of the SR, thereby causing a rapid release\nof Ca2"1" and an elevation of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ concentration to 10-%. Cross-bridge attachment is promoted by the binding of Ca2"1" to the thin filaments.\nThe activating effect of Ca2"1" is mediated by two proteins, tropomyosin and troponin, bound to the thin\nfilaments. In the resting state, cross-bridge\nattachment is inhibited by these two proteins, and\nthis inhibition is overcome only when Ca2+ binds to\nthe troponin. During the relaxation phase, Ca2"1" is\nreaccumulated within the SR, and the cross-bridges\ndetach from the thin filaments.\n\nTable 1.

For brief, intensive activity,\nmuscle can use energy supplied anaerobically via ATP and creatine\nphosphate (CP), and by anaerobic glycolysis, during which the muscle incurs an "oxygen debt".\nExcitation-contraction coupling, the process by which the\nmuscle action potential starts the contraction, derives its energy\nfrom the interaction of ATP with muscle proteins (Young et al. ,\n1983). The anaerobic breakdown of ATP and CP yields energy for\nmuscle contraction, but the stores of ATP and CP in muscle are\nsufficient for only a few seconds of sustained maximal muscle contraction (Guyton, 1981). However, the aerobic reactions that\nfollow decarboxylation of pyruvic acid to acetate and its conversion to acetyl coenzyme A yield the greatest amount of energy.\nAlthough the lactate that is formed during anaerobic muscle contraction may be used in exercise, its fate is difficult to ascertain, and data on adaptations in the glycolytic enzyme system\nconsequent to changes in muscle activity are less certain than\nfor the enzymes involved in end-terminal oxidation (Saltin and\nGollnick, 1983). Small amounts of energy are needed to restore\nthe regulatory calcium ions from the sarcoplasm to the SR and to\npump sodium and potassium ions through the membranes of the muscle\nfibers (Guyton, 1981).\nB.\n\nATROPHIC MUSCLE\n1.\n\nDefinition\n\nAccording to Stewart (1968) atrophy may be considered\nas a decrease in size or wasting away of a body tissue or, in growing\norganisms, as arrested development. In this report, skeletal muscle atrophy associated with space flight is classed as a type of\n"disuse" atrophy, with acknowledgement of the lack of a completely\nsatisfactory definition of the term. Disuse atrophy is widely used\nin the scientific and clinical literature; however, its appropriateness with regard to muscle changes associated with space flight\nis questionable.\nAbramson (1948) noted difficulties in defining the atrophy\nof disuse; he suggested that decrease in size of tissues resulting\nfrom their inability to develop full function might be a general\ndefinition. Robbins and Cotran (1979) list decreased workload as\none of the apparent causes of muscle atrophy, and Saltin and\nGollnick (1983) note that, with disuse or inadequate nutrition,\n\nthere is a loss of muscle mass associated with a decrease in crosssectional area. The LSRO ad hoc Working Group on Muscle Atrophy\nsuggested that an acceptable, basic definition might be a reduction\nin muscle size or mass in contrast to hypertrophy, with implications\nfor associated physiologic and functional effects.\nPathophysiologic features of disuse muscle atrophy include\na shrinkage in the size of muscle cells by partial losses of structural components and organelles such as mitochondria, myofilaments,\nand endoplasmic reticulum (Robbins and Cotran, 1979). Atrophic\ncells are not dead; eventually, however, with marked degrees of\ndisuse, muscle cell death may occur, giving way to replacement by\nfibrous tissue (Crowley, 1976; Robbins, 1967).\nAs noted in Section IV, underuse of the skeletal musculature by space travelers affects mainly the anti-gravity muscles,\nis only a partial or relative type of disuse, and has not resulted\nin marked degrees of atrophy during space missions lasting up to\n6 mo.\n2.\n\nCauses of muscle atrophy\n\nAs mentioned, a decrease or lack of function of\nliving tissues results in their shrinkage or wasting away (Abramson, 1948; Robbins and Cotran, 1979; Stewart, 1968). Atrophy of\nmuscles of the legs and thighs was reported in human volunteers\nkept at strict bed rest while wearing removable lower body plaster\ncasts for 6-7 wk (Deitrick et al., 1948) and in fracture patients\n(Sargeant et al., 1977). Similar effects were reported from other\nmedium- to long-term bed-rest studies (Buznick and Kamforina,\n1973; Kakurin et al., 1966; Krupina et al., 1982; Panov et al.,\n1969; Parin et al., 1971; Petukhov and Purakhin, 1971; Rodahl,\n1969; Triebwasser, 1968).\nMechanical immobilization of joints leads to weakening\nand atrophy of the associated musculature in human subjects\n(Danckwardt-Lilliestrom and Sjogren, 1976; MacDougall et al.,\n1980; Sargeant et al., 1977; Stillwell et al., 1967; Young et al.,\n1980, 1982) and in animals (Booth, 1982; Cooper, 1972; Fournier\net al., 1983; Goldspink, 1977; Herbison et al., 1978; Tabary\net al., 1972; Thomas and Luco, 1944). According to Saltin and\nGollnick (1983), loss of muscle mass associated with joint immobilization results from a decrease in the cross-sectional area of\nthe muscle.\nMuscles of immobilized limbs may decrease in size by 25-50%\nin 30 d (Astrom and Adams, 1981; Guyton, 1981). Denervated muscles\nundergo rapid atrophy, with a loss in bulk of 70-80% in a period\nof 120 d (Astrom and Adams, 1981). Clinical causes of atrophy include: (1) denervation of the musculature as a result of trauma\n\n8\n\nor disease of the spinal cord or motor roots; (2) the spinal muscular atrophies; (3) the peripheral neuropathies; (4) certain stages\nof the progressive muscular dystrophies; (5) the inflammatory myopathies; and, (6) certain myopathies that are associated with metabolic or endocrine disorders (Walton, 1981). Investigative models\nfor study of disuse atrophy in laboratory animals are, for example,\nsurgical denervation or pharmacologic block of nerve conduction;\nchronic tenotomy, spinal cord transection or isolation, joint immobilization, and suspension of rats to produce a head-down body\ntilt with unloading of the hind legs (Fournier et al., 1983; MoreyHolton and Wronsky, 1981; Musacchia et al., 1980, 1983; Steffen\net al., 1981) (see also p.42). Table 2 lists examples of conditions that result in muscle atrophy.\nInterpretation of data on muscle atrophy derived from\nobservation of patients with fractured, immobilized limbs should\ntake into account the evolving knowledge of proteolytic factors\nthat appear to lead to rapid muscle wasting during trauma or sepsis (Baracos et al., 1983a; Beisel, 1983; Clowes et al., 1983a).\nIn this report, primary interest is in the atrophy of the\nanti-gravity muscles, whose customary roles in maintaining body\nposture on Earth are drastically modified in weightless flight.\nThis unloading of the musculoskeletal system in zero-G results in\na unique form of disuse. Available data on muscle atrophy associated with space flight are presented in Sections IV and V.\n3.\n\nPrevention of muscle atrophy\n\nExcept for countermeasures against muscle atrophy in\nsimulated or actual space flight (see p.18, 35), studies of prevention of disuse atrophy have concerned clinical problems that are\ncomplicated by atrophy, such as those mentioned above.\nReinnervation. Reinnervation of denervated muscle following trauma reverses atrophy and restores physiologic function.\nNerve impairment from trauma varies from transient blockage without disruption of the axon to complete division of the nerve.\nWhen axons are damaged, but supporting connective tissue and the\nSchwann cell basement membrane remain intact, regeneration occurs\nat 1-2 mm/d. When damage is more severe, but the perineurium and\nfascicular structures are preserved, regeneration also takes place,\nbut less efficiently than in the preceding example (Bradley, 1981).\nSurgical correction is required when the damage precludes unassisted nerve regeneration. Thus, if it occurs before atrophy\nbecomes irreversible, nerve regeneration is an optimum type of\nprevention of irreversible muscle atrophy following nerve damage.\nNerve regeneration within 3-4 mo of injury may restore muscle\nfunction fully, whereas reinnervation after two years rarely\nrestores any muscle function (Guyton, 1981).\n\no\nJ3\n(0\nu\n0)\n\n2\n\n0)\n\no\n4J\nCO\n0)\nCO\n\n4J\n\ni-l -H\n\ny o\nco o\n\n3 .H\nX 0)\n\no\no.\n00\n0)\n\nas\n\n0)\n\ni-l CU\n\ny y\n\nCD\n\nWl\n\n3 o\n\nS U4\n\nS\nz\n\n*\n\nCO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n4-1\n\nen\n\ny\n\nI 1-1\n\nCS CO\nH C\n0.-H\n3 D\nCA CO\n\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2<\nc\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2a\na>\no\n\nc\no\n\n4-1\n\nCO\n\n3\nCO\n\nO\nco\n\nc\n\n^\nCO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nCO\n\nB\nO\n\n4J\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\ni-H\nCU\n>,\n\nE\nO\n\no\ncj\n\nca\n0)\niH\nO.\nCD\nX\n\nEd\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\ni-l\n\n0\n\na\n^^\nCO\n\ns\n0\n\nu\n3\n01\nC\n0\n\n4J\n\n0\n\ne\n\n\xc2\xa3N\n\n01\n\nca\n\nH\n\n+\n\n<4-l\nO\n\nCO\nCO\n\no\n\npj\n\na\n\nE\n)-i\nO\n\xc2\xa3\n\nCO\n^s\nr-l\n\nO\n\nt-l\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n0.\nCD\nCO\n\nt-i\n\na.\n\n^N\nC\xe2\x80\x94\n\n^^\n\n>\xc2\xbb\nJ=\nc.\no\ntJ\n\n3\n\n4-1\n\nCO\n\nU-l\n\n"O\n\nO)\n\ny\nai\nca\nXI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2<\n\nC\n\nO\n\n>\xc2\xbb\n\nM\n(0\n\nV\n4-1\nCO\n\no\n\n4-1\n\nCO\nCU\n\nCO\n\nf-H\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\n10\n\nXI\n\nO\n\no\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n4-1\n\ny\n\n1-H\n\nc\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\no\n\nCO\nCO\nCU\n\nco\ni-l\n3\n\n3\nO\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xab\n\nCO\nCO\n0)\nr-l\n4-1\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\ng\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n**s\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nCO\n\n^^\n\n>-^\n\nNX\n.\n\nCO\n01\n\nCO\n01\n\ny\n>j\no\n\nu\n\ny\ni*\n\nO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\ncu\ny\n\nT)\nCU\n\nca\no\nj\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\na.\n\n>4-l\n\nCO\n\n01\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\n\nCO\n3\nCO\n\nN\nT-l\n\nU-l\n\ny\n\n3\nS\n\no\n\nU-l\n\no\n\n(0\n\nC\n\n4-1\n\nr-l\n\n3\n\n/^\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2rt\nCO\nB\nCU\n\n4-1\n\noo\n*\n0)\ne\no\nM\n\n>^^\nM7>\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\n3\n0\nI-i\n\nCD\n\n0\n\nP<*^\n/*N\n\n4-1\n\nC\n0\n\nCO\n\n^N\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\n4-1\n\ny\ni-i\n\ne*-.\n\n01\n\ne\no\n\n*H\n\n3\n\xe2\x80\xa2O\n01\n\nas\n\ny\n\n3\n\xe2\x80\xa2W\nCU\n\ncs\n\nc\xe2\x80\x94\n\nB\n\n,c\noo\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\ncu\n\ny T3 i\nco cu T3\n3\n\nco co\n\nCO\nCU\n\nCU\n\xc2\xa3\n\n1-1 IJ\n3 y 4J\ncu 01 CO\n\nE T3 H\n\nElectrical stimulation. Prevention or retardation of\natrophy of denervated muscle by electrical stimulation has been\ndemonstrated in the rat (Fischer, 1939; Grodins et al., 1944a,b;\nHerbison et al., 1971; Kosman, et al., 1947a,b; Shaffer et al. ,\n1954; Stillwell and Wakim 1962; Wehrmacher et al., 1945), the\nrabbit (Gutmann and Guttmann, 1944), and the dog (Kosman et al.,\n1948). Grodins et al. (1944b) also reported preservation of maximum tetanic contraction potential by use of a 25 hertz, 6-7 ma\ncurrent in denervated gastrocnemius-soleus muscles of dogs. It is\nwell established that current intensities must be high enough to\nproduce vigorous muscle contractions to prevent or retard atrophy\nin denervated muscles (Fischer, 1939; Herbison et al., 1971;\nWehrmacher et al., 1945).\nOpinions vary about the utility of electrostimulation in\ntreating neuromuscular disorders (Herbison et al., 1971, 1983;\nLaughman et al., 1983). In disorders involving motor denervation,\nelectrostimulation is the only practical means of inducing muscle\ncontraction (Karpovich, 1968); however, vigorous contraction of\nthe afflicted musculature in such cases requires current intensities that exceed the comfort tolerance of the patient. Basic data\nappear to be too limited to permit rational scientific understanding\nof the effects of electrostimulation on human muscle (Eriksson\net al., 1981; Moreno-Aranda and Seireg, 1981). However, there is\nsome evidence to support the use of electrostimulation in clinical\nsituations with muscle atrophy when the motor innvervation is intact\n(Eriksson and Haggmark, 1979; Gould et al., 1982, 1983; Romero\net al., 1982). Moreover, data from animal studies (Herbison et al.,\n1971) suggest that electrostimulation may prevent or retard atrophy\nof denervated muscle. With regard to muscle atrophy resulting\nfrom weightless flight, the opinion of the ad hoc Group as to the\nuse of electrostimulation is presented in Section V (see p.38).\nEjcercise. Physical exercise by voluntary contraction of\nmuscle groups has long been used to restore atrophied muscle following injury and disease (DeLorme, 1945). To determine the effectiveness of quadriceps-setting exercises in retarding loss of\nstrength in fracture patients with immobilized lower extremities,\nStillwell et al. (1967) studied 22 normal subjects and 21 patients\nwith leg fractures. All 43 persons tested had one lower extremity\nin a long leg cast. The exercises consisted of static contraction\nof the quadriceps in the casted limbs, held for a count of 10 and\nrepeated 10 times per hour (exercised patient group) and a single,\n6-sec maximal isometric contraction of the quadriceps and hamstrings\nfour times per day (normal, casted-exercised group). Another control group consisted of 10 normal subjects who were not in casts\nbut who exercised isometrically at a knee angle of 120\xc2\xb0 or 165\xc2\xb0.\nThe normal, exercised subjects in casts maintained pre-casting isometric tension at a knee angle of 120\xc2\xb0, maintained 10 repetition\nmaximum, and increased isometric tension at a knee angle of 165\xc2\xb0.\n\n11\n\nIn the patients, isometric tension and 10 repetition maximum\ndecreased in both exercised and nonexercised groups; however,\nthe decline in 10 repetition maximum was smaller in the exercised\npatients, suggesting some preventive value in terms of endurance\nstrength.\nOther approaches. Alternative approaches to preventing\nor retarding disuse atrophy have been suggested by certain lines\nof investigation; for instance, the use of aids to muscle protein\nsynthesis such as supplemental leucine (Buse and Reid, 1975; Fulks\net al., 1975; Goldberg and Tischler, 1981), substances that reduce\nmuscle protein degradation in vitro such as leucine and a-ketoisocaproate (Goldberg and Tischler, 1981), and substances that reduce\nmuscle protein degradation in vivo such as mixtures of the branchedchain amino acids (BCAA) (Stewart et al., 1982). The influence of\nanabolic hormones on muscle is also of interest. Goldberg and\nGoodman (1969), for example, reported that growth hormone reduced\nweight loss and induced growth in denervated muscles in hypophysectomized rats. In another study, restoration of muscle weight,\nelectrical activity, contractile capacity, and work performance of\nthe gastrocnemii of immobilized hind limbs of rats treated with\nhuman growth hormone were reported by Apostolakis et al. (1980).\nAnother possible means for preventing or controlling muscle atrophy involves methods of inhibiting the factors that mediate\nmuscle proteolysis. For example, cyclooxygenase inhibitors such\nas aspirin and indomethacin block muscle proteolysis associated\nwith the release of interleukin-1 in patients with sepsis or\ntrauma (Baracos et al., 1983a,b). However, from a clinical point\nof view, this appears somewhat controversial (Clowes et al.,\n1983a,b; Moldawer et al., 1983); nevertheless, if similar proteolytic factors should be discovered in the search for mechanisms of\ndisuse atrophy, the concept may have merit. Further elaboration\nof the roles of the proteases and their inhibitors found in skeletal muscle (Bird et al., 1980) might lead to practical means of\npharmacologic or biochemical intervention. Beneficial effects of\nthe protease inhibitor, pepstatin, in a mouse model of muscular\ndystrophy were reported by Schorr et al. (1978); however, Enomoto\nand Bradley (1977) observed no benefit of treatment with pepstatin,\nantipain, or leupeptin in mice with heredity muscular dystrophy.\n4.\n\nRehabilitation\n\nExperience in rehabilitating atrophic muscles has\nbeen largely in the clinical setting following immobilization of\nlimbs as a result of injury or disease. The basis of muscular\nrehabilitation is voluntary exercise with regimens chosen to suit\nindividual needs (DeLateur et al., 1968; DeLorme, 1945; Karpovich,\n1968; Liberman and Asa, 1959; Miiller, 1970). Restoration of the\nmusculature to its pre-atrophic bulk and power appears to be\n\n12\n\ndifficult in many cases and perhaps impossible in some. Stillwell\nand colleagues (1967) noted that, with the best available techniques , 3-8 wk were required to restore the quadriceps muscle to\nits normal strength, and Karpovich (1968) observed that, often,\ndefinitive treatment ends and rehabilitation starts only after a\nlong period of time. Discussion by the LSRO ad hoc Group suggested that, in patients recovering from disuse atrophy, young\npersons including teenagers, are more likely to recover muscle\nbulk than adults, including young adults (see Section V, p.37).\n\n13\n\nr\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nMUSCLE ATROPHY ASSOCIATED WITH MANNED SPACE FLIGHT\nNATURE AND OCCURRENCE\n\nIn the weightlessness of space flight, the functional load\non the musculoskeletal system is insufficient to maintain normal\nphysiologic status of the musculature. There is no need for active\nopposition to gravity or to maintain customary terrestrial posture,\nand the effort required to move the body and its appendages is\nremarkably reduced (Pestov and Geratewohl, 1975; Smith, 1978).\nNumerous observations of the astronauts and cosmonauts,\nof human and animal subjects of ground-based hypokinetic and limb\nimmobilization studies, and of animals flown in space have demonstrated skeletal muscle atrophy (Berry, 1973; Cherepakhin and\nPervushin, 1971; Deitrick et al., 1948; Dietlein, 1975, 1977;\nGazenko et al., 1980a; Nicogossian and Parker, 1982; Oganov, 1981;\nPestov and Geratewohl, 1975; Sargeant et al., 1977; Thornton and\nRummel, 1977; Whedon, 1982; Whedon et al., 1977; Whittle, 1979).\nSeveral authors reported postflight decreases in human muscle\nvolume and mass, particularly in the lower extremities (Pestov\nand Geratewohl, 1975), and data from the Skylab series of space\nflights showed reduction in muscle strength of the limbs (Thornton\nand Rummel, 1977) and confirmed losses of mass of the leg muscles\n(Whittle, 1979). Associated effects include decreased muscle\nstrength and "tone" and reduced work capacity (Pestov and\nGeratewohl, 1975). The biomedical results of the Gemini, Apollo,\nand Skylab programs included several features in common that were\nreferable directly or indirectly to skeletal muscle effects: minimal to moderate loss of muscle nitrogen, postflight weight loss,\nand postflight decrease in exercise tolerance (Dietlein, 1977).\nOganov et al. (1980) defined the changes in skeletal muscle associated with long-term space flights as "functional atrophy"\nand noted that they included loss of muscle mass, decline of muscle "tone", strength, and endurance, primarily of the muscles of\nthe legs and torso. Increased protein catabolism including breakdown of skeletal muscle has been a consistent finding in space\nflight. A reduction of the volume of the lower extremities and a\npersistent rise in urinary nitrogen, phosphorus, amino acids, and\n3-methylhistidine are some of the typical associated findings\n(Nicogossian and Parker, 1982; Whedon et al. , 1977). Whether\nthese changes are caused by zero-G or other factors in the space\nflight environment has not been fully established, but weightlessness is generally thought to be the main etiologic factor\n(Bricker, 1979; Gazenko et al., 1980b).\nIn the manned Skylab missions (flight durations were 28,\n59, and 84 d), nitrogen and phosphorus balances were negative\nduring the first 2-3 wk, then negative or slightly positive for\n\n15\n\nthe remainder of each mission (Rambaut et al., 1979; Whedon et al.,\n1977). Total caloric intakes of the nine Skylab crew members\nvaried from 35.8-49.7 kcal/kg body wt, having been set at 10%\nbelow preflight values for the 28-d mission and 8-10% above preflight levels for the 56- and 84-d missions (Leonard et al., 1983).\nCompared with preflight values, five of the crew members decreased,\nand four increased their mean caloric intakes during flight. Of\nthe mean inflight total body weight loss of 2.7 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kg (SD) in\nthe nine astronauts, more than half was estimated to be from loss\nof lean body mass (Leonard et al., 1983).\nU.S. astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts have typically\ndeveloped negative potassium balance during flight, manifested\npostflight by decreased values of serum and urinary potassium,\ntotal body content of potassium-40, and exchangeable potassium\n(Gazenko et al., 1980a; Leach and Rambaut, 1977; Leach et al.,\n1975). This negative balance has been ascribed to a reduction of\nthe intracellular potassium depot as a result of a decrease in\ncell mass, particularly in skeletal muscle. The negative potassium balance has persisted for as long as 6 d postflight (Gazenko\net al., 1980a).\nChanges in strength of the arm and leg extensors and\nflexors of each of the three Skylab crews were estimated by preand postflight dynamometry (Thorton and Rummel, 1977). Muscle\nstrength of the crew of Skylab 2, whose sole inflight exercise device was the bicycle ergometer, was measured 5 d postflight. Leg\nextensor strength was about 25% below preflight levels. Decrements\nin arm extensor strength were considerably less than in the legs.\nThere was no loss in arm extensor strength in the Commander, who\nhad pedaled the bicycle by hand as well as by leg (Thornton and\nRummel, 1977). In the Skylab 3 mission (59 d) average loss of\nstrength in the leg flexors was about 18% and about 21% in the leg\nextensors. Again, losses of strength in the arm extensors and\nflexors were generally less than in the lower extremities, which\nprobably reflect the relatively greater workload for the arms during flight. Thornton and Rummel (1977) noted that the legs receive\nvirtually no effective loading.\nSoviet scientists have stated: "The obvious consequences\nof the effects of weightlessness on the motor system included\nslight muscle mass losses, visible atrophy of leg muscles, long\nand wide back muscles and decrease of muscle tone" (Gazenko et al.,\n1981). Kozlovskaya et al. (1981) reported the following muscular\neffects in crew members of the 75-, 140-, 175-, and 185-d Salyut\nmissions:\n(1) "atony" of the calf muscles rear group and atrophy\nof the long muscles of the back; (2) slight "subatrophy" of the\nlatissimus dorsi muscles; (3) slight decrease in strength of the\ngastrocnemius muscles at velocities of 0 and 60\xc2\xb0/sec; (4) a noticeable decrease in strength of the tibialis anticus muscle at all\nvelocities tested except at 180\xc2\xb0/sec; (5) a significant decrease\nin strength/velocity relationship of the neck muscles. Apparently\n16\n\nthese decrements in muscle performance capability persisted for\n6 or more wk postflight (Kozlovskaya et al., 1981). Magnitude of\nthe muscle changes bore no clear relationship to flight duration,\nbut appeared to be inversely proportional to the amount of whole\nbody exercise done inflight.\nAnthropometric measurements of space crews provide additional data on changes in skeletal muscles during flight. The\nrange of reduction of leg volume during the Skylab missions averaged from about 7-11% of the preflight values. More than half the\nloss in leg volume probably resulted from the cephalad shift of\nblood and tissue fluids that accompanies exposure to zero-G; the\nremainder is considered a loss of muscle mass (Thornton and Rummel,\n1977). Similar results have been reported by the Soviet space\nmedical scientists (Gazenko et al., 1981). In the long-term\nflights, decreases in leg volume were pronounced in the first 3 wk,\nthen fluctuated between large decreases, periods of stability, and\npartial recovery (Nicogossian and Parker, 1982).\nPostflight stereometric analysis of the Skylab astronauts\nby means of a stereophotogrammetric method showed major losses in\nvolume of the abdomen, buttocks, and calves, and less pronounced\nlosses in the thighs (Whittle, 1978; Whittle et al., 1977). From\nthese studies, Whittle (1979) estimated that eight of the nine\nSkylab astronauts probably lost muscle from the legs, the largest\namount being 1.43 kg and the average amount, 0.52 kg.\nFinally, integrated electromyograms (IEMG) of the gastrocnemius muscles of the crew of Skylab 3 added further evidence suggestive of muscle atrophy (LaFevers et al., 1975). On the first\npostflight day, the average predominant IEMG frequency was in the\nhigher bands compared with preflight measurements. Similar shifts\nin the patterns of dominant EMG frequencies have been observed in\npatients with nonneurogenic muscular dystrophies (Lenman, 1981),\nsuggesting that such changes in frequency may characterize muscle\nthat is undergoing atrophy from nonneurogenic causes. Postflight\nIEMG analysis of crew members in long-term Soviet missions showed\nmore than a two-fold increase in IEMG value of a standard muscular\neffort (Nicogossian and Parker, 1982; Yegorov, 1980).\nIn summary, exposure to weightlessness as well as hypokinesia/hypodynamia, leads to decreases in muscle "tone", strength,\nand work (exercise) capacity (Pestov and Geratewohl, 1975). Full\nrecovery of muscular strength, especially in the legs, following\nspace flights of medium (weeks) to long (months) duration requires\nfrom several days to several weeks, and data are not available to\nshow conclusively whether full recovery of muscle bulk takes place.\nHowever, the average leg volumes of the Skylab 3 astronauts reached\npreflight values by postflight day 10 (Thornton and Rummel, 1977).\n\n17\n\nStudies in the rat. Rats exposed to zero-G in Cosmos biosatellites for approximately 20 d showed gross and microscopic and\nbiochemical evidence of atrophy and a decline of contractile force\nand work capacity of such antigravity muscles as the soleus and\ntriceps brachii (Gazenko et al., 1980b; Oganov, 1981). The data\nsuggested that an adaptive transformation of the phenotype of the\nmuscle fibers may occur; for instance, slow, antigravitational soleus muscle acquired features of fast muscle. Possible myopathic\neffects of the forces of deceleration during reentry and landing\nand other possible untoward environmental factors on the ground\nprior to recovery were not mentioned (Oganov, 1981). Myofibrillar\nand sarcoplasmic proteins were decreased in the soleus, but not in\nother muscles examined (Gayevskaya et al., 1976). Muscle glycogen\ncontent and activities of glycogen phosphorylase, adenylate cyclase,\nand phosphodiesterase of the space-flown rats did not differ from\ncontrols (Nesterov et al., 1979). Whole muscle demonstrated accelerated rates of contraction (soleus) and a decrease in strength,\nelasticity, and endurance (soleus and extensor digitorum longus).\nThese changes in functional properties were consistent with those\nobserved in intact space-flown rats; for example, a reduced tolerance to static loads (Gazenko et al., 1980b). All observed changes\nin the rats\' musculature disappeared by the 25th postflight day.\nB.\n\nCOUNTERMEASURES\n\nMost evidence suggests that, despite attempts at intervention such as diet and exercise, skeletal muscle atrophy continues\nto some extent throughout orbital flight, manifesting progressive\nmuscle loss and negative nitrogen balance (Leach et al., 1975;\nNicogossian and Parker, 1982; Rambaut et al., 1975; Whedon, 1978;\nWhedon et al., 1977). However, operational experience with the\nastronauts and cosmonauts has strongly suggested that vigorous inflight physical exercise retards the process of physiologic deconditioning of skeletal muscle as well as the cardiovascular system\n(Gazenko et al. , 1981; Nicogossian and Parker, 1982; Thornton,\n1981). Therefore, in view of the lack of alternative preventive\nmethods, daily regimens of physical exercises during flight represent the primary countermeasure against muscle deconditioning.\nExercise devices facilitate the process; for example, NASA has\ndeveloped a compact, teflon-coated panel which can be attached at\nan angle to the deck of the spacecraft which, when used with body\ntiedowns, simulates a treadmill and permits walking, running, and\neven limited jumping. Other exercise devices that have been\ndeveloped and used in the U.S. space flights include the bicycle\nergometer and the "MK-I" (modified Mini Gym") and "MK-II" (chest\nexpander) devices for exercising arms and trunk. NASA scientists\nconcluded that use of the bicycle ergometer is inadequate for maintaining leg strength sufficient for normal walking at 1-G postflight (Thornton and Rummel, 1977). Comparison of the relative\n\n18\n\ndegrees of muscle deconditioning of the three Skylab crews suggested that the greater amounts of exercise used in missions 3 and\n4 may have accounted for the superior postflight muscular condition of the Skylab 3 and, particularly, the Skylab 4 crews.\nBy 1975, the recommended inflight regimen for Soviet\ncosmonauts prescribed three exercise periods daily for a total of\n2.5 h (Dodge, 1976); more recently, Soviet practice has employed\ntwo 40-min periods daily (Kakurin, 1981). Among the estimated\nexercise requirements for inflight use, Thornton (1981) listed:\n(1) for preventing or minimizing loss of strength and muscle mass\nin the legs, walking and running at an equivalent load of 1-G;\n(2) for endurance capacity of the legs, walking for 30 min/d at an\nequivalent velocity of 6-7 mph, 5/d/wk. On the bicycle ergometer,\ninflight exercises at 80 watt-min/d/kg (4.8 kJ/d/kg) lean body\nmass (LBM) (thighs) to 100 watt-min/d/kg (6kJ/d/kg) LBM (calves)\nwere estimated as the levels of effort required to prevent atrophy\nof the thigh and leg muscles (Whittle, 1979). These high levels\nof exercise, equivalent to 30-60 min of hard cycling, support the\nidea (Thornton and Rummel, 1977) that the bicycle ergometer is\ninefficient for maintaining muscle mass and strength.\nCurrent NASA flight schedules include 40 min daily for\nexercise. On the other hand, typical Soviet practice in long-term\nmissions specifies between 1.3 and 2.5 h/d for exercise (Kakurin,\n1981; Yegorov, 1981). In the U.S.S.R., attempts are made to\nselect exercises which involve every muscle group, and they include\nuse of devices such as a rowing machine, bungee cord exercisers,\na treadmill that permits in-place walking, running, and jumping,\nand a bicycle ergometer, all of which are used in each exercise\nperiod.\nOther countermeasures. Electrical stimulation of the leg\nextensors and possibly other muscle groups is a part of the Soviet\napproach to inflight maintenance of muscle. In studies of 18 human\nvolunteers exposed to head-down bed rest of 5\xc2\xb0 for 182 d, electric\nstimulation of various muscle groups for 10 min/d for 10-15 d reportedly was effective as part of a group of methods aimed at preventing or reducing the cardiovascular deconditioning associated\nwith space flight (Kakurin, 1981). In addition, the cosmonauts\nwear an elasticized garment, the "Penguin" suit, which opposes\nbody movement and, to an extent, compensates for the lack of\ngravity on the antigravitational parts of the musculoskeletal\nsystem in the trunk and lower extremities (Gurovskiy et al., 1975;\nNicogossian and Parker, 1982). Electric stimulation and load\nsuits have not been used operationally by the U.S. astronauts.\nIn summary, the primary means of intervention upon which\nboth the U.S. and Soviet space flyers rely for preventing or minimizing muscular deconditioning of space flight is vigorous physical\nexercise, mainly of the dynamic type. Operational experience with\n\n19\n\nlong-term space missions suggests that carefully designed exercise\nregimens scrupulously carried out by spacecrews are effective.\nHowever, studies of nitrogen and mineral balances suggest that muscle atrophy continues to progress during exposure to weightlessness\nregardless of the use of available countermeasures.\n\n20\n\nV.\n\nOBSERVATIONS OF THE LSRO AD HOC WORKING GROUP\nON MUSCLE ATROPHY\n\nThe meeting of the LSRO ad hoc Working Group on Muscle\nAtrophy took place at FASEB Headquarters on July 18 and 19, 1983\n(see p.81 for list of participants). The agenda included presentations on NASA\'s program of research on muscle atrophy by scientists from NASA Headquarters, the Ames Research Center, and the\nJohnson Space Center. A wide scope of topics was discussed, with\nconsiderable emphasis on identifying important gaps in knowledge,\nresearch that should be done, the most suitable models for groundbased and inflight research, and a pressing need for certain\nflight-derived data that would be used for validation of groundbased models and design of meaningful experiments.\nA.\n\nNATURE, CAUSES, AND MECHANISMS OF MUSCLE ATROPHY\nASSOCIATED WITH SPACE FLIGHT\n\nAs noted in Section IV, the skeletal muscle atrophy that\nhas occurred inflight has apparently not compromised crew function\nduring missions [except, possibly, during extravehicular activity\n(EVA) and lunar surface EVA in Apollo 15 (see below)], nor has it\nproved markedly disabling postflight. Nevertheless, recovery of\nnormal muscular strength, bulk, and exercise tolerance has, in\nsome cases, required from several days to several weeks. In\nmissions lasting from about 3 wk to 6 mo, crew members who engaged\nin vigorous leg exercises have demonstrated an ability to maintain\ninflight aerobic exercise capacity as measured by bicycle ergometry,\nHowever, a postflight decrement in muscle strength and endurance\nhas been universally observed, albeit to varying degrees.\nFew instances have been reported of spacecrew exposure to\nextraordinary muscular demands during long-term missions, such as\nstrenuous EVA, in which high muscular efficiency may be at a premium. However, high heart rates accompanied EVA during the Gemini,\nApollo, and Skylab missions. For example, peak rates exceeded 160\nbeats/min in four of the Gemini EVA experiences (Nicogossian and\nParker, 1982). During the lunar surface activities, two of the\nApollo 15 crew developed cardiac arrhythmias and extreme fatigue;\nthe arrhythmias recurred during the return flight to Earth (Berry,\n1974; Pestov and Geratewohl, 1975). Postflight, the Apollo 15\ncrew demonstrated potassium deficiency and had marked difficulty\nin readjusting 1-G (Berry, 1974). Two years after the mission one\nof the crew who had cardiac arrhythmias during the mission suffered\na myocardial infarction (Nicogossian and Parker, 1982). Berry\n(1974) noted that, compared with the other Apollo missions, the\nforegoing untoward responses appeared to be an anomaly.\nSkeletal muscle atrophy was one of several adaptive responses, such as cardiovascular deconditioning, that probably contributed to the tachycardia, arrhythmia, and fatigue mentioned\n21\n\nabove. It is noteworthy that EVA is scheduled in several of the\nSpace Shuttle missions. In view of the fact that crew effectiveness has apparently not been compromised significantly by the\nmuscle atrophy, one might conclude that it is of no practical consequence. However, this position would be fundamentally inconsistent with good preventive medical care of space flyers, the goal\nof which is to take all necessary precautions against any adaptive\nresponses to space flight unless they are shown to be beneficial;\nthat is, to stop the changes before they occur so that weightlessness can be written off as a harmful influence. Thus, muscle\natrophy is a significant biomedical problem of space flight. It\njustifies sufficient investigative effort to determine the exact\ncauses and mechanisms involved, and, ultimately, some practical,\nefficient means of prevention or control that will cause minimum\ninterference with the astronauts\' demanding schedules before,\nduring, and after space missions.\nOpinions of the ad hoc Group varied on the question of\nfull recovery of atrophic muscle following space flight. Some participants were convinced the atrophy is fully reversible; others,\nbased on clinical experience with patients following limb immobilization and other data (Danckwardt-Lilliestrom and Sjogren, 1976;\nSalter, 1957), believed that full recovery of preflight muscle\nbulk may not occur; however, full recovery of muscle strength and\nendurance is likely. There have been reports of persistent decrements in strength and coordination in such activities as tennis in\ncosmonauts following long-term missions, but no quantitative data\nare available.\n1.\n\nCauses of muscle atrophy in space flight\n\nOpinions of the ad hoc Group varied as to the probable cause(s) of muscle atrophy in space flight. Of the several\nprevalent environmental influences such as weightlessness and the\nrelative hypodynamia and hypokinesia imposed by the spacecraft\ndimensions and types of crew activities, all agreed that the unloading of the antigravity parts of the musculoskeletal system is\nthe primary cause. Again, at the level of the whole organism, a\nmajority believed the lack of production of customary muscular\nforce is a key causal factor. Probably related to this are clinical observations that a stimulus for muscle growth is pull across\nthe corresponding joints. Production of muscle force-velocity in\nspace probably requires activation of fewer motor units than are\nneeded for the same level of contraction on Earth. In groundbased studies, care should be taken to simulate the force-velocity\nparameters that prevail in space flight, a factor that emphasizes\nthe need to acquire more data of this sort from astronauts inflight\nHowever, there was some reluctance to accept lack of production of muscle force as an etiologic factor in the absence of\ndata on mechanisms of "nonexercise" atrophy and of exercise hypertrophy. Additional factors such as hormonal imbalance may be\n22\n\ninvolved although it is known that muscle growth occurs both in\nthe skeletal muscle in response to extirpation of a synergist\n(Goldberg, 1967) and cardiac muscle in response to a pressure\noverload (Tipton and Tcheng, 1971) in hypophysectomized rats.\nAn important question related to muscle atrophy that NASA\nshould answer is: What events occur or do not occur in a space\nenvironment that do or do not occur at 1-G that could cause muscle\natrophy? (Table 3).\nTable 3. Comparison of Some Macro-Level Events in Space and on\nEarth That May Be Important Factors in Inducing Muscle Atrophy\n\nResponse*\n\nEarth\n\nSpace\n\nEMG\n\n++++\n\n+++\n\nForce\n\n++++\n\n+\n\nVelocity\n\n+++\n\n++++t\n\nMetabolic\n\n++++\n\n+++\xc2\xa7\n\nNeurohormonal\n\n+++\n\n++++\n\n* normal or optimum = ++++; minimal = +\nt assumed to increase until subject adapts to zero-G\n\xc2\xa7 hypothetically, fewer muscle fibers are activated for limb and\nbody movements in zero-G\nPractical approaches are available for defining the problem of muscle atrophy in astronauts. For example, when muscles\nare activated, varying force and velocity combinations are produced\nby each muscle and muscle group. With very minor adaptations of\nexisting technology, muscle activation (electromyography), forces\n(strain gauges) and velocities (video or potentiometers) can be\nmonitored in astronauts on Earth and during space flight. For\nexample, electrogoniometers and software are commercially available\nwhich record in three planes and are lightweight and easily adaptable for use in spacecraft. The foregoing measurements should,\nand can, be done at least intermittently over a 24-h period. This\ninformation probably will provide the answer to the critical question posed above. Such a direct approach, with both human and animal subjects, probably offers the best likelihood of yielding\npractical data leading to: (1) an understanding of the cause(s)\nof space-related muscle atrophy; (2) identifying the best groundbased models for study; and, (3) designing more meaningful experiments and countermeasures (see also, Research suggestions, p.30-31),\n23\n\n2.\n\nMechanisms\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that the exact biologic\nmechanisms that induce muscle atrophy are unknown and that this is\ntrue of muscle hypertrophy also. Approaches to investigation are\nsuggested by certain established principles of muscle biology and\nsome of the known biologic responses in models of disuse atrophy,\nexamples of which include the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDecreased rates of muscle protein synthesis, appearing\nwithin 6 h in immobilized rat limbs (Booth, 1982) return\nto normal rates within 6 h after remobilization (Booth\net al., 1982).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInsulin responsiveness for 2-deoxyglucose uptake at the\n24th hour decreases in the same model (Booth, 1982;\nSeider et al., 1982).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInsulin appears to be an important hormonal factor for\nshort-term regulation and maintenance of positive protein\nbalance in skeletal muscle (Goldberg et al., 1980a).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPossible retrograde influences of muscle may affect motor\nnerves (Booth, 1982).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMarked differences occur in rates of atrophy of stretched\nimmobilized muscle versus muscle immobilized in the\nresting or shortened positions (Booth, 1977, 1982; Simard\net al., 1982; Specter et al., 1982; Thomas and Luco,\n1944).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn intact, functioning nerve supply is necessary to\nmaintain skeletal muscle in a normal physiologic state\n(Guyton, 1981). When muscle is denervated, strong\nelectrical stimulation may retard atrophy (Karpovich,\n1968).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIn vivo, sarcolemmal resting membrane potentials have\nbeen shown to decrease in denervated muscles (Stanley\nand Drachman, 1980) and, in muscles of immobilized limbs,\nto decrease (Mills et al., 1978) or to remain unchanged\n(Fischbach and Robbins, 1971; Goldberg et al. , 1980b).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nElevated blood cortisone levels have been reported during\nlimb immobilization (Ganong et al., 1955) and space flight\n(Leach and Rambaut, 1977).\n\n24\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAlkaline serine proteinases such as those present in mast\ncells have not been found in muscle cells; however, their\ntissue concentrations increase dramatically in the muscular dystrophies, starvation, and endocrine imbalances\n(Bird et al., 1980). Their possible role in conditions\nthat feature accelerated degradation of myofibrillar proteins may deserve further study.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIntracellular Ca^+-activated proteinases may offer approaches to investigating the regulation of muscle protein turnover (Dayton et al., 1976; Reddy et al., 1975).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCathepsins B, D, H, and L and associated inhibitors such\nas pepstatin and leupeptin may be involved in myofibrillar\nprotein degradation of disuse atrophy (Bird et al.,\n1980).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn apparent increase has been reported in glucocorticoid\nreceptors in the cytosol of immobilized gastrocnemius\nmuscle cells (DuBois and Almon, 1980).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe somatomedins stimulate both proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells in vitro. Insulin is active\nonly at grossly supraphysiological concentrations, and\nprobably cross-reacts with the somatomedin receptors\n(Ewton and Florini, 1981).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPassive tension or repetitive stimulation retards protein\ndegradation in isolated muscle preparations (Goldberg,\n1979; Goldberg et al., 1975).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMuscle protein degradation may be induced by thyroid hormones (Goldberg et al., 1980a). Increased postflight\nlevels of thyroxine in the Apollo (Sheinfeld et al., 1975)\nand Skylab (Leach and Rambaut, 1977) astronauts, suggest\nheightened thyroid gland activity during missions.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIntracellular leucine concentrations may influence the\nrate of protein synthesis in disused muscle (Morgan\net al., 1981).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInactivity of skeletal muscle induced by joint immobilization or by pharmacologic or surgical denervation is\nassociated with an increase in extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors (Fischbach and Robbins, 1971; Lavoie\net al., 1976; Pestronk et al., 1976a).\n\n25\n\nB.\n\nSELECTED PHYSIOLOGIC FACTORS\n1.\n\nNutrition\n\nThe essential importance of adequate nutrition for\nthe maintenance of positive nitrogen balance is well recognized.\nConsequently, a great deal of care goes into the provision of welldesigned meals that offer ample amounts of calories and all the\nmacro- and micronutrients in accordance with modern nutritional\npractice. Data from the U.S. and Soviet manned space program were\ndiscussed by the ad hoc Group. Reports of Soviet missions lasting\nup to 6 mo (Gazenko et al., 1981; Yegorov, 1981) suggest that the\ncosmonauts were able to maintain their body weight with the diets\nprovided and the daily schedule of activities including physical\nexercise. Metabolic studies carried out in the Skylab program led\nto a conclusion that, despite the provision of well balanced, carefully formulated diets, the astronauts experienced a net negative\nnitrogen balance, part of which has been ascribed to loss of muscle mass. Although adequate nutrition is provided for spacecrews,\nthe meals are not always taken systematically or consumed completely, especially during the first few days of a space mission.\nHowever, in the opinion of the ad hoc Group, and with the assumption that the astronauts consumed adequate food during past space\nflights, nutrition was not considered to have been a significant\nfactor in the etiology of muscle atrophy. Consequently, additional\nnutritional intervention, with the possible exception of the BCAA,\nwas not considered a promising investigative approach to the problem of muscle atrophy. However, the possibility that supplemental\nBCAA or their alpha keto analogues might benefit synthesis of muscle protein deserves consideration (Goldberg and Chang, 1978;\nGoldberg and Tischler, 1981; Morgan et al., 1981; Stewart et al.,\n1982). In addition, for maintenance of optimal muscular strength\nand endurance, a well-balanced diet is essential.\n2.\n\nMetabolic changes\n\nThe mineral and nitrogen metabolic study of the\nSkylab astronauts, known as Experiment M 071 (Rambaut et al.,\n1977, 1979; Whedon et al., 1977), was carefully planned and carried out. It involved critical efforts of the investigators and\nextraordinary cooperation of the astronauts to maintain constant\ndietary intake and continuous daily urine and feces collection for\nperiods spanning 3-4 wk preflight, continuously inflight, and\nfinally, about 2.5 wk postflight.\nDiscussion of the results of Experiment M 071 suggested\nthat, despite its excellence, certain shortcomings in specimen\ncollection and analysis may have led to overestimation of the\nreported, inflight, negative nitrogen balance. The nitrogen excretion rates reported were high, much higher than those reported from\n\n26\n\nhuman bed-rest studies. Nevertheless, the available data seem to\nindicate that the nitrogen balance of the Skylab astronauts during\nthe space flights varied from negative to only slightly positive.\nIn addition, other evidence from the Skylab biomedical studies,\nsuch as a negative shift in potassium and phosphorus balances,\npoints toward degradation of skeletal muscle as the main source\nof the negative or marginal nitrogen balances (Leach and Rambaut,\n1977; Thornton and Rummel, 1977; Whedon et al., 1977; Whittle\net al., 1977). Total hydroxylysine excretion also increased,\nsuggesting breakdown of collagen (Leach and Rambaut, 1977).\nSoviet scientists have reported that the inflight physical fitness and nutritional measures used in their long-term missions have succeeded in preventing undue muscle atrophy and have\npreserved body weight (Gazenko et al., 1981; Yegorov, 1981). However, maintenance of the cosmonauts\' body weight may have been, in\npart, at the expense of muscle mass. Soviet investigators have\nreported decreases in blood levels of free amino acids postflight\nin the crews of Salyut missions lasting 21-, 140-, and 185-d\n(Popov and Latskevich, 1983a,b,c). As a result, cosmonauts\' diets\nhave been supplemented with amino acids.\nIn light of the available information, the ad hoc Group\nconsidered that a negative nitrogen balance and some degree of muscle atrophy occur in weightless flight, but that it is possible to\nretard the muscle deconditioning by exercise regimens that have\nalready been demonstrated inflight. In contemplating the gross\ndimensions of muscle atrophy, it is useful to recall that muscle\nis 20% protein; thus, for example, loss of 300 g muscle protein\nwould represent a loss of 1.5 kg of muscle tissue.\n3.\n\nNeurophysiologic and kinesiologic\n\naspects\n\nConsiderable discussion was devoted to neurologic\nand neuromuscular aspects of disuse muscle atrophy such as myoneural junction physiology, neurotrophic factors, motor unit\nrecruitment, and various means of manipulating the motor innervation of muscle to produce study models including models of disuse\natrophy. The latter are treated in Section V-E (p.41).\nSome of the key questions pertaining to neuromuscular\nfunction in relation to space flight include: (1) What level of\nactivation of muscles and what forces, and perhaps velocities of\nmovement occur in a normal day\'s activities of an astronaut on\nEarth and in space? (2) What is the level of neuromuscular potential output prior to, during, and after space flight? (3) Is the\nneuromuscular fatigability of astronauts affected during space\nflight? The atrophy that occurs during space travel is almost\ncertainly muscle mass lost in cross-sectional area and not in the\nlength of fibers as can occur in some immobilization studies. So,\n\n27\n\nchanges in muscle force may reflect changes in the degree of\natrophy. Another possibility, however, is that during prolonged\nflight there will also be a change in the maximum level of neuromuscular excitation that an astronaut can produce. The strength\ntest is the best test for this in that it is functional, simple,\nand can be performed easily. If atrophy occurs without a loss\nin strength, then this too would be useful information. The EMG\nsignal will provide information relative to the level of excitation of the muscle group being tested.\nA good deal of experimental evidence supports the view\nthat one of the key neurotrophic factors influencing muscle function and integrity is the neuromuscular transmitter, acetylcholine\n(Ach), and its associated regulatory processes at the myoneural\njunction (Drachman, 1974; Drachman et al., 1982a,b). Pharmacologic blockade of Ach transmission changes the resting membrane\npotential (RMP) and the number of extrajunctional Ach receptors in\nskeletal muscle in a manner quantitatively equal to that of surgical denervation (Drachman et al., 1982a,b), suggesting to the\ninvestigators that Ach transmission is the neurotrophic factor\nthat regulates the two properties studied. In addition, the data\nsuggest that spontaneous, nonquantal Ach release may regulate\nother properties of skeletal muscle that have been ascribed to nonimpulse-mediated, "forward" neurotrophic factors such as substances\ndelivered to muscle via axonal transport in motor neurons (Guth\nand Albuquerque, 1977; Guth et al., 1981; Gutmann, 1975, 1976).\nMembers of the ad hoc Group noted that, while the term\n"trophic" has acquired different meanings in various branches of\nbiologic science, fundamentally it means nutritional, and the etymology of neurotrophic should indicate whatever the motor nerve\ndoes to maintain the integrity of the muscle. According to Gutmann\n(1976) the term "neurotrophic relations and functions" should be\nrestricted to long-term regulation not mediated by nerve impulses.\nThe question whether such nonimpulse, forward neurotrophic factors\nare involved in skeletal muscle maintenance has been debated for\ndecades and remains unresolved. The ad hoc Group\'s opinion on\nthis was divided; however, the question appears to have little\nrelevance to the etiology of space-related muscle atrophy where\nthe nerve supply remains intact. Nevertheless, it is important in\nterms of the types of animal models that should be used in the\nstudy of disuse atrophy.\nAnother question concerns the effect of hypokinesia, hypodynamia, and limb immobilization on neural activation of muscle.\nThere are only a few published reports in which the quantity of\nneuromuscular electrical activity has been measured in muscles of\nimmobilized limbs over, for instance, a 24-h period (Fischbach and\nRobbins, 1971; Fournier et al., 1983). Integrated EMG values were\nremarkably decreased in some experiments, but not abolished, and\n\n28\n\ninter-study variation in values was substantial. Fischbach and\nBobbins (1971) reported no changes in junctional sensitivity to\nAch and muscle membrane sensitivity in their immobilized rat model,\nand they considered it unlikely that any form of immobilization in\nwhich the innervation remains intact would result in complete synaptic silence. However, the significance of sustained neuromuscular\nelectrical activity in immobilized limbs in terms of muscle atrophy\nis not clear.\nFinally, it was noted that motor nerve denervation does\nnot always result in muscle atrophy. Examples are hypertrophy of\ndenervated diaphragm and anterior latissimus dorsi muscles of\nchickens (Feng et al., 1962, 1963; Sola and Martin, 1953; Sola\net al., 1973). Reasons for the apparent paradox are not known,\nbut muscle stretch was suggested as a possible mechanism.\n4.\n\nEndocrine changes\n\nWith respect to the significance of the hormonal\nchanges that have been reported from manned space flight, the\ndegree of change, as reflected by plasma and urine levels, was\nprobably insufficient to influence muscle integrity and function.\nThis opinion was based on evidence from both animal experiments\nand clinical experience with endocrinological disorders suggesting\nthat substantial deviations from normal levels of circulating hormones are needed to cause muscle wasting. On the other hand, some\nparticipants believed that further investigation of hormonal interactions with skeletal muscle is justified in attempting to advance\nthe quest for mechanisms of muscle growth, hypertrophy, and atrophy as well as metabolic regulation. Although it seems unlikely\nthat alterations in growth hormone and/or somatomedin levels\nduring space flight would cause disuse atrophy, it is possible\nthat these hormones (or agents that cause their secretion) could\nbe very useful in the treatment of the condition.\nIn addition, data from experiments with a rat model of\nhypokinesia (head-down suspension) showed significant changes in\nglucocorticoid levels and density of glucocorticoid receptors in\nhindlimb muscles, which were consistent with increased muscle protein degradation (DuBois and Almon, 1980, 1981; Steffan and\nMusacchia, 1982). However, one member of the ad hoc Group emphasized that circulating hormone levels, not tissue receptor levels,\nusually determine the level of a tissue response.\nThe animal castration model (Hanzlikova and Gutmann, 1978)\nwas not considered appropriate for studies of space-related muscle\natrophy. Finally, the question whether there is a significant central hormonal effect on muscle atrophy associated with disuse or\nweightlessness appears unresolved.\n\n29\n\n5.\n\nResearch suggestions\n\nExperiments should be planned to test the effects of\ndietary supplements of the BCAA, particularly leucine, and the\nketo-analogues of the BCAA in both ground-based and space-flown\nanimal models of disuse atrophy.\nIn view of the limited knowledge about the rates of loss\nof nitrogen during space flight, consideration should be given to\nundertaking additional human metabolic studies in suitable future\nspace missions. Useful data could be derived from such an experiment in the Shuttle program; however, more meaningful data would\nrequire longer-term missions such as those contemplated for the\nspace station.\nTo obtain data on the neuromuscular activity during an\nastronaut\'s typical day, terrestrial as well as inflight measurements are needed. These should include: (1) electromyography,\nwith surface electrodes, of the quadriceps and hamstrings as well\nas the dorsi- and plantarflexers of the feet; (2) forces produced\non the heel and bases of the metatarsals via transducers built\ninto the footwear; and, (3) joint movements by means of sensors on\nthe knee and ankle. Each parameter can be recorded directly on\nsmall units similar to those used for ambulatory electrocardiography. Techniques are available for all the suggested measurements; however, some equipment development may be necessary for\nitem (2).\nIt would appear that these devices can be integrated\nwithout any infringement on the existing planned programs. There\nshould be no significant effects on the astronauts. They should\nnot have to modify their planned programs and there should be\nlittle or no discomfort to them. The experiment is simply to\ndetermine what they do with respect to movement during their normal activities. It will require no additional time inflight or\npreflight once the appropriate sensors are instrumented.\nFor acquiring human data on the level of neuromuscular\npotential output prior to, during, and after space flight, the\nfollowing is suggested: measure the maximum force that can be\nproduced at zero velocity for the knee extensors, knee flexors,\nand the dorsiflexers and plantarflexers of the feet. The necessary tension-recording device can be installed into the existing\nhardware of the spacecraft. The strain gauge could weigh only a\nfew milligrams. The same device used for recording EMGs could be\nused for these maximum force data.\nA more nearly functional assessment of neuromuscular\nactivity would be to test the ability to exert a maximum force at\nsome selected velocity, or better, to produce some target force at\nsome target velocity. This is technically within the state-of-theart, but would require more development for inflight use than the\n30\n\npreviously mentioned test. It would also require some time commitment from the astronauts. These tests would not be useful in\ndetecting muscle atrophy, but they would determine whether there\nis a functional change in movement control that might occur as a\nresult of muscle atrophy. This information would be very important\nbecause of the fine movement control that is presumably needed in\nroutine operations during flight.\nTo investigate the question of neuromuscular fatigability\nduring space flight, measure the maximum force that can be produced\nover a period of 2 min while exerting a maximal effort once every\nsecond, with simultaneous recording of the EMG. This test should\nbe done several times preflight, within a week of launch, and as\nsoon after return as possible (within Id). The muscle group to\nbe tested initially should be perhaps the plantarflexers of the\nfoot. The recording devices could be the same as in the previously described experiment. Other muscle groups should be tested\neventually, e.g., dorsiflexers of the foot and elbow flexors and\nextensors. Also, if an arm exercise is being performed, some venous blood samples could provide an indication of significant\nchanges in the metabolic potential of the muscle group. This\nexperiment is important because there is the general idea that disuse results in a rapid, significant loss of a muscle\'s metabolic\npotential.\nThree properties of skeletal muscle that should be considered for study in the rat model of hypokinesia (e.g., the tailsuspension model) are RMP, extrajunctional Ach receptors, and\nisometric muscle strength. Additional studies are needed to determine whether the decrease in IEMG activity reported from experiments\non immobilized limbs (Fischbach and Robbins, 1969; Fournier et al.,\n1983) influences the degree of associated muscle atrophy.\nConsideration should be given to the extension of studies\nsuch as those of Florini and associates (e.g., Ewton and Florini,\n1981) and Almon et al. (e.g., DuBois and Almon, 1980; 1981) to\ninclude the effects on mature muscle cells, isolated muscle preparations, and intact muscles in vivo, of altered levels of hormones\nand possible changes in their receptors that are known to result\nfrom various models of hypokinesia and hypodynamia including\nactual weightlessness (e.g., Tigranyan et al. , 1982). Studies are\nneeded, as well, on the influence of growth hormone and the somatomedins (e.g. . Florini et al., 1977; Goldberg and Goodman, 1969)\nand anabolic steroids (Powers and Florini, 1975) on muscle protein\nsynthesis and muscle atrophy in animal models of hypokinesia/hypodynamia. However, these studies should be designed with full\nawareness of the whole animal studies done by Florini\'s group in\nthe 1960s.\n\n31\n\nC.\n\nBIOCHEMICAL ASPECTS\n\nDiscussion involved mainly the loss of myofibrillar protein, regulation of protein synthesis and degradation, alterations\nin metabolic potential, and associated enzymatic changes in muscle\natrophy induced by hypokinesia/hypodynamia.\nThe main problem in understanding muscle atrophy is that\nsome basic questions concerning muscle biology still remain unanswered. For instance, although a wealth of information exists\nabout the biochemistry of protein synthesis, the basic mechanisms\nof muscle protein synthesis and degradation in biologic responses\nsuch as muscle atrophy and hypertrophy are not well understood\n(Millward et al., 1980a,b). Conceivably, decreased rates of protein synthesis might reflect specific adaptations to altered\nenergy demands rather than to disuse, per se; however, the availability of energy does not appear to be rate-limiting in protein\nsynthesis (see p.33). Muscle protein degradation was reviewed\nrecently by Millward et al. (1980a). It has been demonstrated\nthat a portion of the cellular protein is degraded within lysosomes (Goldberg and Chang, 1978), and to some extent this portion\nof protein degradation is sensitive to growth factors such as\ninsulin. However, this association is not sufficient to implicate\nthe lysosome in the degradation of normal actin and myosin or in\nthe accelerated degradation seen in disuse atrophy. Little is\nknown about the mechanism of disassembly and degradation of the\ncontractile apparatus. It is equally possible that the lysosome\nis involved in the degradation of membrane receptors and certain\nmacromolecules which require hydrolytic action to release specific\nprecursors or cofactors and not contractile proteins (Stauber\net al., 1981).\nTwo examples illustrate such an alternative role for the\nlysosome in muscle metabolism. The first and best known is the\nuptake and degradation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) by receptormediated endocytosis. Here LDL are delivered to lysosomes where\nthe protein is degraded to amino acids and the cholesteryl esters\nto free cholesterol to be used by the cell for synthesis. The\nsecond is the transport of cobalamin (vitamin 8^2) via a protein\ncarrier, transcobalamin II. Again the lysosome is utilized to\ndigest the carrier to release the active cofactor. Thus, it is\ndesirable to investigate the role of lysosomes in muscle metabolism,\nbut from a broad point of view. Considerable cytochemical information on lysosomes in muscle is available that is pertinent to proteolytic enzymes, pathways, and regulatory mechanisms of protein\ndegradation during disuse atrophy (Trout et al., 1979a,b; 1981),\nbut it has not helped to explain a possible role of lysosomes in\nmuscle atrophy. Two alkaline proteases have recently been identified in muscle, and their possible role in activation of lysosomal\nproteases has been demonstrated (Stauber et al., 1983). It is\nlikely that the list of proteases in or associated with muscle\nwill continue to expand.\n32\n\nTechnical problems in the measurement of rates of protein\ndegradation in skeletal muscle have impeded progress in this area\n(Goldberg and Dice, 1974; Goldberg et al., 1980a). Consequently,\ndata on muscle protein turnover should be interpreted with caution,\nparticularly in terms of quantitative changes. For instance, it\nmay be premature to reach firm conclusions on muscle protein synthesis and degradation from experiments involving prelabeling of\nmuscle and measuring release of phenylalanine in a model of hypokinesia. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that there is a\nloss of myofibrillar protein in muscle atrophy, with a reduction\nin cross-sectional area of the muscle fibers and a change in metabolic potential. A fundamental problem is the lack of an identified mechanism for explaining exercise hypertrophy in muscle, that\nis, to bridge the gap between increased turnover of ATP to increased\nmuscle protein synthesis. An important research goal is to isolate the substance in exercising muscle which stimulates synthesis\nof the myofibrillar proteins (Saltin and Gollnick, 1983). Such a\ndiscovery could lead to more precise experiments on the mechanisms\nof muscle atrophy induced by inactivity.\n1.\n\nMetabolic capacity\n\nMuch information has been generated in recent years\nabout the adaptability of skeletal muscle to various modes of use\nand under-use (Saltin and Gollnick, 1983). Numerous studies in\nrats and other species have shown that endurance training increases\nthe capacity of the citric acid cycle, fat oxidation, and the\nelectron-transport system. However, data on the effect of inactivity on the metabolic capacity of muscle are relatively limited.\nJoint immobilization in experimental animals has been shown to reduce\nthe oxidative capacity of muscle, but to a lesser degree than inactivity produced by denervation (Saltin and Gollnick, 1983). For\nexample, changes in muscle cell mitochondria reflected by reduced\ncapacities to oxidize glucose, pyruvate, palmitate, and 8-hydroxybutyrate have been reported in a rat model of disuse (Rifenberick\nand Max, 1974; Rifenberick et al., 1973). On the other hand,\nrelatively small changes in metabolic capacity have been reported\nafter prolonged immobilization of primate hindlimbs (Edgerton\net al., 1975). From their recent literature review, Saltin and\nGollnick (1983) noted a general concensus that there are no major\nchanges in the contractile characteristics of skeletal muscle as a\nresult of various types of physical training or inactivity.\nIt is known that in normal skeletal muscle, about 99% of\nthe ATP that is hydrolyzed is used for contraction; large changes\nin the amount of available energy in the cell occur without affecting nucleic acid synthesis. Moreover, there is no evidence that\nthe availability of energy is rate-limiting in protein synthesis.\nHowever, the effects of genetic regulation are relatively well\nestablished, and are rate-limiting in situations in which plenty\nof energy is supplied. This appears to be a promising area of\ninvestigation.\n33\n\nThe lowering effect of inactivity on mitochondria! size\nand numbers and on the aerobic capacity of muscle has been shown\nin studies that demonstrated a close correlation among these properties and levels of muscle activity. For example, Saltin and\nGollnick (1983) cite 32 reports from studies in the 1960s and early\n1970s of adaptations of mitochondrial enzymes of human skeletal\nmuscle in response to endurance training. The largest increases\nin muscle mitochondria occur in response to submaximal, prolonged\nexercise where lactate levels rarely rise very high. However,\nwith heavy resistance exercise, high lactate levels are produced\nand muscles increase in mass, but not in numbers of mitochondria.\nIn immobilized limbs of rats, loss of respiratory control and\nmalate dehydrogenase activity in the gastrocnemius and plantaris\nmuscles promptly followed skeletal fixation and there was a reduction in the yield of mitochondrial protein throughout the course\nof atrophy (Rifenberick et al., 1973). Energy metabolism in the\nsame model decreased in the atrophying muscles (Rifenberick and\nMax, 1974), suggesting to the investigators that deficiencies in\nenergy metabolism may be significant in the progression of muscle\natrophy.\nIt is known that, following limb injuries, athletes can\nrestore muscle strength in the affected limb within about 30 d;\nhowever, return of muscle endurance may require 6 mo or longer\n(Sherman et al., 1981). Measurement of mitochondrial enzyme\nmarkers was suggested as an approach to following the responses\nof muscle to reduced activity such as in space flight. However,\nsome participants considered that the mitochondrial response to\ninactivity may be either unrelated to or too variable to provide a\nfirm basis for estimating muscle atrophy. For instance, in crossreinnervation/innervation experiments in cats, there was no muscle\natrophy and the mean tension of motor units in the cross-reinnervated and reinnervated muscles was normal (Chen et al., 1982). In\naddition, the slow-oxidative, fatigue-resistant muscle maintained\na high oxidative capacity as was shown histochemically, and a\nresistance to fatigue even though the muscle was reinnervated by\nfast, low-oxidative, and fatigable motoneurons (Edgerton et al.,\n1980). Thus, some members of the ad hoc Group believed the significance of mitochondrial change in relation to the atrophic\nprocess has not been firmly established.\n2.\n\nResearch suggestions\n\nIn the search for mechanisms of muscle atrophy\nresulting from inactivity or under-use, studies of mechanisms of\nexercise-induced hypertrophy should be considered. Key targets in\nsuch investigations include identification of the specific stimuli\ngenerated by exercise and determination of how such stimuli are\ncommunicated as specific chemical signals to the genes to induce\nthe synthesis of proteins involved in muscle hypertrophy. For\n\n34\n\nexample, a major breakthrough would be to isolate a protein or\nother agent which is secreted by, or found in, exercising muscle,\nwhich stimulates the reading of the DNA of actin and myosin.\nInvestigations of the effects of inactivity or under-use\nof skeletal muscle on the synthesis and degradation of muscle proteins need to be rigorously controlled in order to yield useful\nquantitative data. Results of some experiments appear questionable because of uncontrolled variables such as reutilization of\namino acids of degraded muscle proteins and lack of data on rates\nof synthesis and degradation in the models used.\nD.\n\nCOUNTERMEASURES\n\nDiscussion of methods of intervention to prevent or control muscle atrophy associated with space flight focused on physical exercise, nutrition, pharmacologic or biochemical approaches,\nand electrostimulation.\nRehabilitation of atrophic muscles was\ndiscussed also, although it was recognized that NASA\'s objective\nis to obviate the need for rehabilitation by prevention or control\nof muscle atrophy.\n1.\n\nExercise\n\nAvailable data seem to indicate that daily, vigorous\nphysical exercise inflight such as can be done with the aid of\nvarious devices (see p.18) retards the rate and degree of muscle\natrophy during long-term missions (Gazenko et al., 1981; Nicogossian\nand Parker, 1982; Thornton and Rummel, 1977). However, the available evidence of a continuing negative or marginal nitrogen balance (Leach and Rambaut, 1977; Whedon et al., 1977) as well as the\ndisproportionate amount of time devoted to exercise, such as the\n1.3-2.5 h/d prescribed for Soviet missions, emphasizes the need\nfor improvement in methods of intervention. Thus, further investigations are indicated to determine types and amounts of physical\nexercise that would help to preserve muscle strength, endurance,\nand mass with the least daily expenditure of time and energy. The\nliterature is enormous on exercise and work physiology, physical\nfitness training, strength and endurance training, and muscle\nrehabilitation following injury or disease. However, the limited\ndata on the effects of space flight on muscle strength and endurance suggest a need for additional information that can be obtained\nfrom inflight experiments (see p.30, 31), and ground-based simulation studies. Even without additional data, expert analysis of\navailable knowledge should permit some improvement in recommended\ntypes and amounts of exercise by judicious selection of methods\nbetween the known extremes of one daily isometric contraction of\none second\'s duration at two-thirds of maximum strength to maintain strength (Hettinger and Miiller, 1953) and the 1.3-2.5 h/d\ncombination of exercises used by the cosmonauts.\n35\n\nOne possible reason suggested for the apparent utility of\nthe treadmill-type device as an aid to inflight exercise is that\nit includes eccentric contractions, that is, the lengthening of\nmuscle while it is developing tension (Seliger et al., 1980).\nAccording to unpublished information presented during the ad hoc\nmeeting, recent clinical experience has shown that pure eccentric\nexercises used following hand surgery resulted in dramatic rehabilitation. It has also been shown that creatine kinase (CPK) is\nreleased to a far greater degree during eccentric than concentric\ncontractions (Newham et al., 1983a). However, it appears that\nmuscle damage and muscle soreness are more likely with eccentric\nthan with other forms of exercise (Hikida et al., 1983; Newham\net al., 1983b). Since the question whether eccentric contraction\nis superior to concentric modes for rehabilitation and strength\ntraining and for retarding muscle atrophy in models of inactivity\nhas not been settled, it deserves additional study.\nThe matter of preflight, optimal physical fitness for\nwithstanding the adverse effects of weightless flight appears to\nbe unresolved. In terms of resistance to certain effects of muscle atrophy, some evidence suggests that physical training before\nexperimental immobilization provides a "reserve" of neuromuscular\nfunction that retards loss of voluntary strength and reflex potentiation, compared with untrained control subjects (Sale et al.,\n1982). It has been customary, incidentally, for space flyers to\nkeep themselves in a high state of preflight physical fitness.\nHowever, some investigators believe that a high level of preflight\nfitness based, for example, on endurance training, tends to\nincrease susceptibility to orthostatic intolerance postflight\n(Klein et al., 1977). These investigators suggested postflight\northostatic tolerance depends, in part, on the size of the vascular bed in the leg muscles, which is known to decrease in atrophic\nmuscle. Thus, the hypertrophy of muscle which results from some\ntypes of physical training would appear to be a disadvantage\nduring the immediate postflight period (Whittle, 1978).\nIt has long been known that immobilizing a muscle in a\nstretched mode will markedly retard the rate of disuse atrophy for\na limited number of days or weeks (Booth, 1977, 1982; Summers and\nHines, 1951; Thomas and Luco, 1944; Thompson, 1934). Moreover,\nstretch-induced hypertrophy of skeletal muscle has been reported\nin animal models such as the chicken (Holly et al., 1980; Sola\net al., 1973). Discussion of the possible practical utility of\nthis property of muscle suggested that stretch results in a longer,\nnot a stronger muscle fiber; that is, stretch does not result in\nan increase in cross-sectional area of muscle, which is a key\nparameter in muscle strength. While muscle atrophy may be retarded\nin the stretched muscles, atrophy of their antagonists, placed in\nthe shortened mode, may be accelerated (Fournier et al., 1983;\nSimard et al., 1982; Spector et al., 1982). Stretching of muscles\nwas not considered a practical approach to intervention of muscle\natrophy associated with space flight.\n36\n\nThe time course of recovery of muscle strength following\ninjuries or neurologic disorders appears to differ from that of\nmuscle bulk. Strength frequently returns in a matter of weeks,\nprovided suitable exercise is used. However, when a limb has been\nimmobilized for a short period for orthopedic reasons, it is very\ndifficult to rehabilitate the atrophic muscles to normal bulk\n(Danckwardt-Lilliestrom and Sjogren, 1976; Salter, 1957).\nDocumentation of the degree of decrement in endurance of\nthe leg muscles of astronauts appears to be limited, suggesting\nthat additional pre- and postflight measurements should be made.\nOpinion varied as to whether significant changes in muscle strength\nand endurance would occur during 7-10-d space flights. For example, the estimated rate of muscle protein synthesis in the hind\nlimbs of rats declined 37% after 6 h of limb immobilization, suggesting to the authors that very early changes occur in molecular\nevents that regulate protein synthesis in disused or immobilized\nmuscle (Booth and Seider, 1979). Krieger et al. (1980) reported\nthat immobilization of rat hind limbs for 2 d resulted in a\ndecrease in state III respiration and the respiratory control\nindex of the sarcolemmal, but not the intermyofibrillar, mitochondria of gastrocnemius muscles. However, there are no reports of\nsuch short-term changes in strength and endurance performance of\nimmobilized muscles in the rat. Moreover, it appears that endurance properties of muscles change little after prolonged limb\nimmobilization in such species as the guinea pig (Maier et al.,\n1976), rat (Witzmann et al., 1983), and subhuman primate (Edgerton\net al., 1975). Human subjects exposed to simulated weightlessness\nfor 7 d by means of immersion in water demonstrated a 30-40%\ndecrease in maximum dynamic and isokinetic strength of the leg\nextensors and in the isokinetic strength of the tibial muscles\n(Grigor\'yeva and Kozlovskaya, 1983). The authors regarded these\nrapidly developing changes as reflexive responses to the removal\nof load bearing. Since little is known about the time of onset\nand rate of progression of muscle atrophy in space flight, a majority of the participants favored taking advantage of opportunities\nfor such studies in the Space Shuttle Program (see also p.30, 31).\nReview of the Skylab data indicated that exercise with\nthe bicycle ergometer apparently reduced the amount of leg atrophy\nto be expected, but it was considered an inefficient method compared with other types of exercise made possible by devices such\nas the "treadmill" equipped with elastic tiedowns for the user\n(see p.18). There was general agreement that inflight exercises\nfor astronauts should include types for maintaining both strength\nand endurance. Two-to-three d/wk would probably suffice for\nstrength-building exercises, and another 2-3 d/wk for endurance\ntraining.\n\n37\n\n2.\n\nElectrical stimulation\n\nAnimal and human studies have demonstrated that\nelectrical stimulation of inactive muscle, such as exists in\ndenervation or immobilization, can retard and perhaps prevent\nmuscle atrophy (Fischer, 1939; Grodins et al., 1944a,b; Herbison\net al., 1971; Kosman et al., 1947a,b, 1948; Laughman et al., 1983;\nShaffer et al., 1954; Stillwell and Wakim, 1962; Wehrmacher et al.,\n1945). With regard to space application, Soviet investigators\nreported beneficial effects of electrostimulation of muscles in\nhuman subjects exposed to prolonged simulated weightlessness\n(Kakurin et al., 1973; Georgiyevskiy et al., 1979). Daily electrostimulation of the muscles of the abdomen, back, thighs and legs\nduring a 45-d bed-rest experiment was credited with favorable\neffects on muscle "tone", strength, and static and dynamic endurance. Soleus muscle biopsies showed a "positive effect of electrostimulation ... preventing development of the atrophic process"\n(Kakurin et al., 1973). In a similar study, 8 of 12 healthy volunteers received electrical stimulation of the anterior and posterior\nmuscles of the legs and thighs as well as back and abdomen for\n2 daily 30-min periods, six times/wk while remaining at bed rest\nfor 45 d in a 6.5\xc2\xb0 head-down tilt position (Georgiyevskiy et al.,\n1979). Although all subjects showed decreases in circumferences\nof legs and thighs as measured on day 40 of the experiment, the\nmean change in the stimulated group was significantly less than in\nthe controls. The authors noted that the "general condition and\nendurance ... were better among individuals whose muscles were\nsubmitted to stimulation." It is understood that electrostimulation is used operationally in the Soviet space program as a part\nof their system of countermeasures against the adverse effects of\nspace flight.\nAfter discussion, the ad hoc Group considered that electrostimulation is not a useful technique for prevention of muscle\ndegradation during space flight, for several reasons:\n(1) voluntary contraction of muscle is the most efficient and physiologic\nmeans; (2) the intensity of electric current required to produce a\nmaximum contraction is intolerable in most subjects; and (3) the\nfact that the effectiveness of electrostimulation is dependent\nupon the electric impulse density, which, in muscle, diminishes\nmarkedly only 10 mm from the point of stimulation. The use of\npad electrodes applied to the skin would probably result in stimulation of only the superficial fibers in a muscle.\nHowever, it is possible that electrically-induced muscle\ncontractions employing easily tolerated amounts of current may\noffer some advantage in terms of sensory perception of the associated limb movement, a sort of biofeedback to train individuals to\ncontract their muscles maximally.\n\n38\n\n3.\n\nOther approaches\n\nOther ideas that were mentioned include the possible\nutility of a motion-resistive carapace or exoskeleton for wear by\nspace flyers, and pharmacologic or biochemical means of intervention. Soviet authorities advocate use of a load suit except\nduring hours of relaxation and sleep (Gurovskiy et al., 1975).\nThis garment, which is known as the "Penguin" suit, is said to provide partial compensation for zero-G by opposing body movements\nand simulating a constant gravitational load on the muscles of the\ntrunk and legs (Nicogossian and Parker, 1982).\nLeucine possesses some apparently unique regulatory and\nmetabolic properties in muscle, including the promotion of protein\nsynthesis and inhibition of protein degradation (Goldberg and Chang,\n1978). These properties of leucine and possibly of combinations\nof other BCAA may offer an experimental approach to a dietary or\nbiochemical method of intervention (Goldberg and Chang, 1978;\nGoldberg and Tischler, 1981; Morgan et al., 1981; Stewart et al.,\n1982). Stewart et al. (1982) administered a mixture of branchedchain ketoacids to patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and\nobserved a reduction in the rate of excretion of 3-methylhistidine\n(3-MeH) in the urine. The authors concluded that the mixed ketoacids reduced muscle protein degradation acutely in their patients.\nFinally, pharmacologic intervention by use of inhibitors\nof proteolysis has stimulated interest in laboratory experimentation in disorders such as muscular dystrophy. It has been reported\nthat microbial anti-proteinases such as antipain, leupeptin, and\npepstatin inhibit degradation of denervated pectoralis muscle in\nchickens (Stracher et al., 1979) and chicken dystrophic muscle in\ntissue culture (McGowan et al., 1976). Schorr et al. (1978)\nreported beneficial effects of treatment of dystrophic mice with\npepstatin, starting at 3 wk of age and continuing for 5 wk. However, Enomoto and Bradley (1977) found no evidence of suppression\nof muscle degeneration in dystrophic mice given subcutaneous injections of leupeptin and pepstatin during their remaining life spans\nstarting at age 35 d. On the contrary, there is some suggestive\nevidence that, for example, elevations in lysosomal proteases (for\nwhich a few inhibitors are available) result from muscle regeneration, not muscle degradation (Griggs and Rennie, 1983; Stauber,\n1980). On this basis, administration of an inhibitor could conceivably interfere with the process of muscle protein synthesis,\nan event presumed to be beneficial in recovery from muscle atrophy.\nThus, there is currently little scientific basis for the use of\nprotease inhibitors to prevent disuse atrophy in man; however, the\nsubject deserves further investigation.\n\n39\n\n4.\n\nResearch suggestions\n\nA careful analysis of available data on the effectiveness of eccentric muscular contractions in terms of physical\nfitness training and rehabilitation of atrophic muscle should be\ndone. If eccentric exercise has some advantages over other modes\nfor maintenance of strength and endurance, its use as an inflight\nmode should be investigated, including studies with human subjects\nexposed to simulated space flight. Prospective investigators\nshould be aware of the availability of versatile exercise devices\nwhose operating modes include eccentric exercises. For example,\nsee Knuttgen et al. (1982).\nBiochemical, neurophysiologic, and other properties of\nmuscle during adaptation to eccentric loading should be determined\nin an animal model to complement the human studies suggested above.\nTo acquire data for use in improving inflight exercise\nregimens, pre- and postflight measurements of maximal voluntary\ncontraction of the flexors and extensors of the arms and legs\nshould be done on all personnel who participate in space flights.\nSuch measurements should be made despite the idea that missions\nlasting only 7-10 d probably induce little muscular deconditioning.\nThe importance of matching the test methods to the types of exercises used should be kept in mind.\nSkylab data suggest that exercise with the bicycle ergometer at a level of 80 watt-min/d/kg LBM (4.8 kJ/d/kg LBM) maintained thigh muscle mass, but 100 watt-min (6kJ) was required to\nprevent atrophy of the calf muscles (Whittle, 1979). If possible,\nground-based studies should be devised to determine the reasons\nfor this difference. Hopefully, the derived information could be\napplied to improving inflight exercise devices and regimens.\nA human, ground-based study should be considered for\ndetermining the minimum amounts of strength or endurance exercises, or combinations of these, needed to prevent muscle atrophy\nin a model of hypokinesia.\nPossible modifications of available inflight exercise\nregimens and devices should take into account the need to control\nor prevent all responses to zero-G that might benefit from various\ntypes and amounts of exercise including cardiovascular deconditioning, muscle atrophy, fluid shifts, and, possibly, the space sickness syndrome and bone demineralization. With regard to the\nlatter, the pronounced negative calcium balance of space flight is\nthe subject of a parallel study by LSRO, to be published under the\ntitle, "Research Opportunities in Bone Demineralization", edited\nby S.A. Anderson and S.H. Cohn.\n\n40\n\nHuman as well as animal studies of the possible preventive benefit of supplements of leucine and/or combinations of isoleucine and valine should be done in models of disuse atrophy. A\ncomplementary effort should be considered to determine whether the\neffect of leucine on protein synthesis is sustainable for a prolonged period or is limited to an acute response. Similar data\nshould be sought regarding the effect of metabolites of leucine on\nproteolysis.\nAnimal studies should be expanded to assess the possible\npreventive value against disuse atrophy of administering inhibitors\nof myofibrillar proteases and other proteases involved in muscle\nprotein turnover. Part of such investigations should be identification of untoward side effects, which could be more onerous than\nthe disuse atrophy itself.\nSpeculation about possible reduction of sensory perception\nof muscle contraction during space flight suggested a need for an\nexpert analysis of available data on this subject (see p.38). If\nthis were identified as a significant problem in achieving optimum\nmuscular contraction during inflight exercises, electrical stimulation of muscles could be considered as a method for increasing sensory perception.\nFinally, the report of Sale et al. (1982) that muscle "...\ntraining prior to immobilization provided a reserve of neuromuscular function (reflex potentiation) which attenuated the effect of\nimmobilization in relation to the control conditions" suggests a\nneed for more data on this type of approach. In addition, NASA\nscientists should consider reexamining available data from groundbased and space flight studies to explore relationships among:\n(1) physical fitness training before and during real and simulated\nweightlessness; (2) postexposure exercise capacity, orthostatic\ntolerance, and +GZ acceleration tolerance; (3) the muscle deconditioning response; and, (4) the cardiovascular deconditioning\nresponse. This should include consideration of the data reviewed\nby Klein et al. (1977) and data presented by Goldwater and Sandier\n(1982) suggesting an inverse relationship between aerobic fitness\nand tolerance for gravitational loads. Such an analysis may aid\nin resolving questions about optimal physical fitness and exercise\nregimens for space flyers.\nE.\n\nMODELS, METHODOLOGY, AND EQUIPMENT\n1.\n\nModels\n\nThe question of the most suitable models for investigating muscle atrophy related to space flight received considerable\nemphasis during the ad hoc meeting. This involved techniques of\nsimulating hypokinesia and weightlessness in human and animal\nexperiments, the best animal models, and the lack of acceptability\nof the much-used term "disuse" atrophy.\n41\n\nTrue disuse of motor units typically results from interruption of motor nerve input to the muscle and features electrically silent myoneural junctions. Thus, models of "disuse" based\non such techniques as denervation do not realistically simulate\nthe situation in space flight where the innervation remains\nintact. Again, with the intact neuromuscular system as one criterion, mechanical immobilization cannot truly be a model of disuse in that voluntary contractions of the involved muscles occur\n(Fournier et al., 1983). It is apparent, therefore, that space\nflyers experience a reduction in the amount and force of activity\nof the musculature that probably should be thought of as a type of\n"under-use". For studies with human subjects, the best, currently\navailable, ground-based model appears to be bed rest with physical\nactivity ranging from minimal to specific schedules of exercise or\npostural changes, depending on the experimental objectives.\nTo date, the best animal model for simulating the hypokinesia and hypodynamia of weightlessness appears to be the rat\nmodel in head-down tilt that unloads the hind legs (Feller et al.,\n1981; Morey-Holton and Wronski, 1981; Musacchia et al., 1983).\nThe head-down tilt is achieved by tail suspension or a body harness. According to unpublished information presented during the\nmeeting, comparisons of atrophic effects from experiments with the\nhead-down tilt model, other models of "disuse", and from spaceflown experiments suggest the head-down tilt model produces\nreasonably good simulation of weightlessness in the rat\'s hind\nlegs. The usefulness of this model for studying changes in body\ncomposition has not been validated.\nAlthough mechanical immobilization of joints is widely\nused as a means of producing "disuse" atrophy, it was not considered a good model for simulating the physical conditions of\nspace flight. Nevertheless, its utility was acknowledged as a\nmeans of inducing muscle atrophy for various sorts of investigation in muscle biology including, for example, testing of techniques of intervention. Moreover, when muscle atrophy resulting\nfrom space flight becomes better characterized at both the macroand micro-levels, mechanical immobilization may prove to be a\nvalid research model for studies of space-related muscle atrophy.\nTwo other models were suggested as advantageous for\ncertain types of studies. Human patients or animal models with\nspinal cord damage could provide, during certain intervals after\ninjury, an excellent model of true disuse atrophy which could be\nused for special studies such as determining the minimum amount of\nelectrically-induced exercise needed to prevent atrophy. Data of\nthis sort could then be used in formulating optimum voluntary\nexercises for use in weightless flight.\n\n42\n\nThe other model of a pure disuse atrophy involves pharmacologic blockade of motor nerves with tetrodotoxin, which blocks\nnerve impulses but not fast axonal transport (Drachman et al.,\n1982a,b). Otherwise, the neuronmscular anatomy and physiology\napparently remain unchanged, but the resulting muscle atrophy\nmatches that of denervation. Again, this may prove to be a useful\nanimal model for space-related studies if it can be validated by\ndata from studies with other models including space-flown rats and\nthe rat head-down tilt model.\nTraining muscle groups to a level of hypertrophy, then\nstopping training and measuring various parameters such as rate\nof reversion to pre-training status may roughly simulate the\neffects of under-use of muscles during weightlessness and is applicable for human and animal experiments (Houston et al., 1979). A\nsimilar model could be used to measure changes in muscle groups\ntrained for endurance (Faulkner et al., 1972); however, evidence\nis limited that fatigability of muscle increases during space\nflight or after immobilization.\nOther models that are considered useful for investigation\nof muscle atrophy involve tissue culture, organ culture, and\npartial-body perfusion techniques such as hemiperfusion and isolated, perfused muscle preparations. As is known, experiments based\non tissue culture or perfusion techniques in which the tissues are\nhomogenized and then measured for incorporation or disappearance\nof a marker sometimes yield data of questionable validity because\nof confounding problems such as the reutilization of amino acids\nfrom degradation of muscle proteins in experiments on muscle atrophy. A problem in using isolated, incubated muscle preparations\nis hypoxia or anoxia of the deeper portions if the muscle is too\nthick; insufficient tissue oxygenation for cells beyond those on\nthe surface introduces uncontrolled variables. Nevertheless, certain types of muscle studies involving tissue culture (Ewton and\nFlorini, 1981; Florini et al., 1977), organ culture or hemicorpus\nperfusion (Goldberg and Chang, 1978; Goldberg et al., 1980a;\nJefferson et al., 1972; Li and Jefferson, 1978) have produced\nvaluable data.\nIn summary, although all the models discussed have shortcomings in terms of simulating the environment of space flight and\nother technical flaws, those offering certain investigative advantages are identified in the foregoing. While no model is ideal, a\nbetter understanding of the nature, causes, and mechanisms of\nspace-related muscle atrophy will permit refinement of experimental\nmodels for both ground-based and inflight studies.\n2.\n\nMethodology and equipment\n\nSome methods for measuring muscle strength and endurance fail to take into account the accessory action of all muscle\ngroups involved. For instance, the contribution of the iliopsoas\n43\n\nand trunk muscles to extension and flexion of the knee is often\nincluded with strength values credited solely to the quadriceps\nand hamstrings. Definitions, methods, and apparatus seem to need\nimprovement.\nMuscles that are feasible to study in human subjects in\nterms of relatively isolatable EMG signals include the biceps\nbrachii, triceps brachii, quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anticus,\nand gastrocnemius.\nIn addition, muscles whose customary levels of\nactivity would, presumably, not change significantly in zero-G\noffer useful models for comparison with muscles that are known to\natrophy. Examples suitable for human studies include the masseters\nand temporalis muscles (provided that a normal amount and strength\nof chewing occur inflight), and, for animal studies, the diaphragm,\nanal and bladder sphincters.\nThe practicality of using 3-MeH as a method of following\nmuscle protein degradation was discussed. 3-MeH has been called a\nunique marker because during the breakdown of muscle proteins it\nis released and excreted unchanged and quantitatively in the urine,\nnot being reutilized for protein synthesis or oxidized for energy.\nRecent examples of reports on the method and its advantages and\npossible shortcomings include Afting et al. (1981), Anonymous\n(1983), Elia et al. (1981), Long et al. (1981), Millward et al.\n(1980a,b), Ward and Buttery (1978), Wassner and Li (1982), and\nYoung and Munro (1978). Certain problems call for caution in\ninterpreting 3-MeH excretion data. First, endogenous sources of\n3-MeH other than muscle are becoming better recognized, such as\nskin and gastrointestinal tract (Long et al., 1981). As much as\n40% of 3-MeH excreted in urine may be derived from sources other\nthan skeletal muscle. Second, dietary sources such as meats perturb the normal rates of excretion; and, third, the values for\nnormal rates of excretion may not be as well established as they\nshould be for quantitative use (Long et al., 1981). In addition,\nlittle is known about diurnal variation in 3-MeH excretion and the\ninfluence of exercise.\nThe meeting participants regarded the 3-MeH method as\nuseful in studies of muscle atrophy provided that (1) dietary\nintakes are either excluded or quantified; (2) an allowance is\nmade for other known endogenous sources in the species under\ninvestigation; and (3) other measures of protein breakdown are\nincluded, such as nitrogen balance data (e.g., total nitrogen\nand urea excretion), measures of lean body mass, and creatinine\nexcretion.\nMembers of the Group advised that in ground-based studies, care should be used to simulate the force-velocity parameters\nof muscle function in space flight. The fact that data on this\nare very limited reemphasized the prominent need for inflight\nmeasurements.\n\n44\n\nA method for human studies of interest to short-term\nmissions and having such advantages as simplicity, relatively low\nexpense, and "built in" controls, might involve bed rest with or\nwithout casting of one lower extremity (one-leg model) for 2 wk.\nDuring this period different types and schedules of voluntary exercise would be included for the control (nonimmobilized) leg along\nwith comparative measurement of strength, endurance, and other\nparameters of both legs. For instance, such one-leg models have\nbeen useful in investigating the adaptive responses of human skeletal muscle to exercise (Saltin et al., 1976).\nWith respect to equipment and devices, discussion focused\non: (1) the excellence of currently available miniature electrodes,\nsensors, and recorders for noninvasive acquisition of signals such\nas EMG; (2) means of gross measurement of muscle atrophy, strength,\nand limb motion; and, (3) the increasing numbers and variety of exercise devices that are of interest to biological scientists, clinicians, and specialists in physical training. Devices designed for\nresearch in both concentric and eccentric exercise modes have been\ndescribed by Knuttgen et al. (1982) and Knutsson (1983).\nThe accuracy of assessing muscle atrophy by measuring\nchanges in limb circumference and volume is somewhat limited\nbecause of masking by fat, extramuscular connective tissue, and\nchanges in extracellular fluid volume. While such methods have\ntheir uses, they are inadequate for obtaining precise quantitative\ndata and have been associated with underestimating amounts of muscle atrophy (Young et al., 1980; 1982).\n3.\n\nResearch suggestions\n\nMethods and devices for measuring muscle strength,\nendurance, and velocity in different exercise and test modes\nshould be improved for application to specific research on spacerelated muscle atrophy. Objectives should include simplification,\nease-of-use, and miniaturization. More attention should be given\nto noninvasive means of improving the gross measurement of muscle\natrophy. Promising methods that may aid in measuring muscle mass\nand dimensions include computer-assisted tomographic scanning\n(Ingeman-Hansen and Halkjaer-Kristensen, 1980), ultrasonography\n(Young et al., 1980), and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.\nTo acquire necessary data to be used for identifying the\nmost appropriate research model for investigating the effects of\nweightlessness on muscle, the following parameters should be\nmeasured in normal rats and in the several models of "disuse"\natrophy that have been chosen by investigators: EMG, force, and\nvelocity of movement of the dorsi- and plantarflexers of the feet\nover 24-h periods. The models should include immobilization by\ncasting and by pinning (Fischbach and Robbins, 1969; Fournier\net al., 1983), head-down tilt by tail suspension or body harness\n45\n\n(Feller et al., 1981), paraplegia, specific muscle group denervation, and specific pharmacologic nerve block by tetrodotoxin introduced subperineurally (Drachman et al., 1982a). These studies\nwould be the ideal experiments. They would determine whether any\nof the above models is adequate to help understand space-induced\natrophy by matching these results with those from space-flown\nrats. Comparisons also can be made with the experiments on astronauts. One problem is that not all of the above measures can be\nmade effectively on rats. However, some strategic compromises can\nbe made to make this experiment possible.\nBecause of the unique properties of 3-MeH as a convenient\nmarker for muscle protein degradation, and in view of a scarcity\nof data on its behavior in such situations as heavy resistance\nexercise, endurance exercise, eccentric versus concentric contractions, and possible diurnal effects on its excretion rate, additional studies should be considered.\nWith respect to rehabilitation of atrophic muscles it is\nlikely that the same types of exercise recommended for inflight\nuse should be used for rehabilitation. With regard to choices of\nexercises some variables that should be taken into account are:\n(1) level of neuromuscular activation, (2) frequency of contractions, (3) number of contractions, and (4) the effect of lengthening versus shortening contractions. The suggestive evidence that\neccentric contractions may be advantageous should be investigated\n(see p.59).\nF.\n\nTHE NASA RESEARCH PROGRAM IN MUSCLE ATROPHY\n\nThree documented components of NASA\'s programs of research\nand analysis in muscle atrophy and muscle biology came to the attention of the LSRO ad hoc Working Group on Muscle Atrophy: (1) the\nformally programmed Research and Technology Objectives and Plans\n(RTOP) document, No. 199-20-42, Muscle Atrophy; (2) several university-based studies in NASA\'s Space Biology Program; and, (3) one\nhuman and three rat experiments scheduled for Spacelab 4. Table 4\nlists summary information on the Biomedical Research Program on\nMuscle Atrophy. In addition, as parts of other activities including the flight program of the Space Transportation System (Space\nShuttle), NASA develops and tests exercise devices and regimens,\npersonal protective/life support equipment and suits, and plans\nand conducts space medical tests and observations of the astronauts that yield data of interest to the biomedical problems of\nspace flight, including muscle atrophy.\nThe ad hoc Group was concerned mainly with that part of\nNASA\'s Biomedical Research Program dealing with muscle atrophy.\nHowever, it recognized the potential of the parallel activities\nmentioned above. The overall program appears well conceived to\nembrace the key objectives and research approaches needed for\n46\n\nTable 4.\n\nThe NASA Biomedical Research Program in Muscle Atrophy\n\n1.\n\nProteolysis in muscle atrophy (Task -01).\nThe objective of\nthis task is to define the basic proteolytic enzymes, pathways,\nand regulatory mechanisms involved in disuse atrophy of skeletal\nmuscle. Current emphasis is on the role of specific lysosomal\nand nonlysosomal muscle proteases in muscle atrophy. A future\nstudy will attempt to localize tripeptidyl aminopeptidase (TAP)\nin muscle, relate various prostaglandins to lysosomal behavior\nand control of TAP content, and determine the effect of disuse\natrophy on concentrations of Ca2+_activated proteases.\nPrincipal Investigator: S. Ellis, NASA Ames Research Center.\n\n2.\n\nGrowth factors and muscle atrophy (Task -02).\nThe objective\nis to test the hypothesis that disuse atrophy results from a\ndeficiency of specific growth factors originating in the nerves\nof muscles undergoing atrophy. Current studies examine the\nresponses of cultured chick myoblasts to highly purified neurotrophic factor (NTF) (Popiela and Ellis, 1981), and future\nefforts will: (a) investigate the presence of growth factors\nand inhibitors in normal, hypertrophic, and atrophic muscle;\n(b) determine the effects of rat and rabbit NTF on cultured\nchick myoblasts; and, (c) titrate the sensitivity of protein\nsynthesis and degradation as influenced by insulin in muscle\nundergoing atrophy. Principal Investigator: S. Ellis, NASA\nAmes Research Center.\n\n3.\n\nThe role of bioassayable growth hormone in protein balance\n(Task -03).\nThe objective is to clarify the role of growth\nhormone in protein balance by isolating and characterizing the\nmajor circulating forms and developing a radioimmunoassay (RIA).\nFuture studies will employ the RIA to measure the hormone in\nrats that have been suspended, exercised, centrifuged, proteindepleted, or treated with growth hormone releasing factor.\nPrincipal Investigator: R.E. Grindeland, NASA Ames Research\nCenter.\n\n4.\n\nGonadal steroids and muscle atrophy (Task -06).\nThe objective is to elaborate mechanisms that regulate muscle size by\nmeans of an androgen-sensitive muscle in the rat, the levator\nani. The effects of androgenic or estrogenic hormones, or\ntheir depletion, on the size of the levator muscle and its\ntestosterone receptor concentrations were studied. Future\neffort will be devoted to: (a) the regulation of cytosolic\nandrogen receptors in muscle by sex steroids; (b) hormonal\nregulation of glucose turnover in normal and atrophic muscle;\n(c) oxidative metabolism in muscle following gonadectomy and\nafter hormone replacement; and, (d) the nature of estrogenandrogen synergy in muscle. Principal Investigator: S. Max,\nUniversity of Maryland.\n\n47\n\nTable 4.\n\n(cont.)\n\n5.\n\nMuscle fiber type distribution relative to muscle weakness: a\nnew method (Task -07).\nThe objective is to develop and validate a method for determining fiber types in muscles of subhuman\nprimates. Percentages of fast and slow fibers in five skeletal muscles have been determined in monkeys by the differential\nratio of Sr^+/Ca^+ concentration for activation of tension.\nFuture effort will include analyses of muscle biopsy samples\nfrom chaired and free-moving monkeys for fiber type and rayosin\nheavy and light chain content. Principal Investigator: W.G.\nKerrick, University of Miami.\n\n6.\n\nMechanisms and control of disuse atrophy in skeletal muscle\n(Task -10).\nThe objective is to define the role of stretch in\nthe synthesis and activity of muscle contractile proteins and\nsarcoplasmic reticulum. Organ culture of rat soleus muscle\nwas tested for viability and utility as a model for studying\nvarious factors in muscle atrophy such as the influence on protein degradation, of aspirin or protease inhibitors, changes\nin twitch kinetics, and the effects of stretch on proteolysis.\nThe studies will be continued along similar lines. Principal\nInvestigator: J.D. Etlinger, S.U.N.Y. Downstate Medical\nCenter, Brooklyn.\n\n7.\n\nBiochemical adaptations of antigravity muscle fibers to disuse\natrophy (Task -12). The objective is to investigate the\nmolecular basis of disuse atrophy in the rat soleus muscle,\nwith emphasis on protein and carbohydrate metabolism. Rates\nof synthesis of actin and cytochrome c were determined at the\nsixth hour of limb immobilization; no change was found in the\nlevel or activity of the reputed insulin mediator in the muscle\nafter 24 h of immobilization. Future effort will probe the\ncontent of actin mRNA in the muscle during the first 6 h of\nimmobilization and determine whether a translation of actin\noccurs during the same time period. Principal Investigator:\nF.W. Booth, University of Texas Health Sciences Center, Houston.\n\n8.\n\nAlterations in skeletal muscle with disuse atrophy (Task -13).\nThe objective is to characterize the adaptive responses of rat\nskeletal muscle to moderate and prolonged disuse by hindlimb\nimmobilization, evaluate the role of motor activity in disuse\natrophy, and elucidate factors that influence recovery such as\nthe duration of immobilization, electrical stimulation, and\nexercise. Data have been obtained on: (a) responses of the\nsoleus muscle to casting for 6 wk in the shortest possible\nposition; (b) temporal changes in twitch duration time; (c)\nrates of recovery in terms of isometric twitch duration and\n\n48\n\nTable 4.\n\n(cont.)\n\nhalf-relaxation time; (d) changes in rates of Ca^+ uptake of\nsarcoplasmic reticulum from slow soleus and two types of fast\nvastus lateralis fibers. Future efforts will emphasize in vitro\nstudies of the contractile properties of single-skinned fibers,\nchanges in the light chains and sarcoplasmic reticular proteins,\nand Ca^"*" uptake and release kinetics of sarcoplasmic reticula\nof the three atrophying muscle fiber types. Principal Investigator: R.E. Fitts, Marquette University.\n9.\n\nImmobilization/remobilization and the regulation of muscle mass\n(Task -14).\nThe objective is to determine the role of glucocorticoids in the responses of skeletal muscle to under-use\nand disuse. Baseline data were developed in young, growing\nrats on temporal changes in the sizes of the soleus and extensor\ndigitorum longus and on the following biochemical parameters:\n(a) total protein; (b) total noncollagen protein; (d) total\ncollagen; (d) soluble protein; (e) total myofibrillar protein;\n(f) myofibrillar noncollagen protein; (g) collagen in the myofibrillar fraction; and (h) DNA content. Future studies will\ndetermine glucocorticoid sensitivity of hindlimb muscles\nduring immobilization and recovery and, by in vitro methods,\nanalysis of atrophic muscle for glucose uptake, amino acid uptake and incorporation, ribosomal activity, protein degradation,\nglutamine and alanine production, and proteolytic activity.\nPrincipal Investigator: R.R. Almon, S.U.N.Y. Buffalo.\n\n10. The combined influence of stretch and mobility on muscle atrophy\ncaused by immobilization (Task -15). The objective of this\nnew task is to investigate physical factors that influence the\nresponses of skeletal muscle to immobilization. Factors to be\nstudied include: (a) passive stretch in relation to muscle\nfiber development, physiologic performance, and protein turnover;\n(b) minimum force and number of muscle contractions needed to\nprevent atrophy; (c) effectiveness of negative, positive, and\nisometric contractions in producing hypertrophy and preventing\natrophy of muscle fibers; and, (d) alterations in connective\ntissues of muscles and tendons induced by immobilization and\ninactivity. Principal Investigator: G. Goldspink, Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\n49\n\nultimate solution to the operational problem of muscle atrophy.\nPeriodic review of advancing knowledge in muscle biology and\nclosely related fields and appropriate revision of the program\nwill be an important, continuing activity of NASA management.\nThe Working Group took note of the muscle research in the\nNASA Space Biology Program and the experiments that have been planned for Spacelab 4, all of which appear to increase NASA\'s potential to elucidate the mechanisms and resolve the problem of spacerelated muscle atrophy. These researches are listed in Table 5.\nThe experiments in the Space Biology Program explore the effects\nin rats of simulated weightlessness on: (a) the biochemical\ncharacteristics of changes in fast and slow muscle, regulation of\nacetylcholinesterase and other proteins involved in neuromuscular\ntransmission and their axoplasmic transport (Dettbarn); (b) mechanisms of changes in protein/RNA relationships in hindlimb muscles\nof the rat head-down tilt model, and glucocorticoid receptor levels\nand sensitivities (Musacchia); (c) motor control including muscle,\nmotor neuron, and sensory components (Stuart); (d) histochemical\nchanges during atrophy and recovery, with emphasis on identifying\nthe most sensitive physiologic, histochemical, and biochemical\nresponses (Templeton and Sutko); and (e) the biochemical adaptations of muscle to nonweight-bearing conditions including the fate\nof excess amino acids liberated in muscle during atrophy and\nstudies of methods of preventing muscle atrophy, such as passive\nstretch (Tischler).\nIn Spacelab 4, the human study (Stein) will examine the\neffect of zero-G on whole-body protein metabolism in an effort to\nestablish whether the nitrogen loss is caused principally by\ndecreased uptake and production of protein or by increased mobilization and metabolism of muscle protein. Measurements will include\nrates and levels of incorporation of \xe2\x80\xa2\'\xe2\x80\xa2^N-glycine into various proteins and hemoglobin and rates of urinary excretion of 3-methylhistidine, hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine and their glycosides.\nSimilar studies will be done in rats, but in addition, the animal\nexperiments will include morphologic changes in muscles and nerves\nand biochemical analyses of muscle proteins. The effect of zero-G\non the capacity of both rested and exercised skeletal muscle for\noxidative metabolism will be investigated (Baldwin). Analysis of\nskeletal myosin isoenzymes will facilitate a determination of possible shifts from slow- to fast-twitch muscle fibers (Hoh). Dr.\nEllis\' experiments with rats in Spacelab 4 cover several physiologic, morphologic, biochemical, and histochemical aspects including\nobservation of inflight activity patterns, electromyography, anatomic changes in slow- and fast-twitch muscle, assays of the proteolytic and mitochondrial enzymes in the muscles, and an attempt\nto differentiate the biologic effects in the anti-gravity muscles\nand nerves of launch stress, inflight atrophy, reentry stress, and\nlate postflight recovery.\n\n50\n\nTable 5.

Spacelab 4\n\n51\n\nBaldwin\n\nAs noted during the meeting of the ad hoc Group, the Biomedical Research Program on Muscle Atrophy is young, and the\nefforts of NASA program planners and managers to improve it within\nthe constraints imposed by limitations of budget, manpower, and\nrelative priority are recognized. The research tasks in this program are generally consistent with the recommendations in two of\nthe more recent, formal advisory reports on NASA life sciences\n(Bricker, 1979; Whedon, 1978). Research that was considered by\nsome members of the Working Group to be appropriate to the stated\nobjectives of the program included tasks -01, -10, -12, and -13.\nTasks containing some elements that appear to address the objectives include -03, -06, and -07, and the newly-initiated task -15\nappeared pertinent as outlined. In general, the program seems to\nneed sharper focusing on its stated objectives.\nTo aid in aligning the program in muscle atrophy with\nNASA\'s scientific and technical requirements, research suggestions\nare detailed in the preceding parts of Section V and in Section VI.\nThe suggestions are for the consideration of NASA planners in the\nhope that incorporation of some of the described approaches may\nimprove the program and ultimately assist in resolving the issues\nof space-related atrophy.\nG.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nMuscle atrophy associated with short-term space flights\n(e.g., 7-10 d), is apparently not grossly detectable by currently\navailable methods, nor is it a functional problem. Nevertheless,\nin missions extending beyond approximately 3 wk, muscle atrophy\ntypically progresses to a level that, while nonincapacitating in\nflight, may severely interefere with readaptation to 1-G. In\naddition, it would probably compromise physiologic efficiency for\nstrenuous extravehicular activity.\nDaily vigorous physical exercise inflight appears to\nretard the atrophic process, but, despite this and other preventive measures, nitrogen balance tends to remain negative or only\nslightly positive; the negative nitrogen balance appears to result\nfrom loss of lean body mass.\nUnloading the musculature in weightlessness is generally\naccepted as the cause of the muscle atrophy. However, the exact\nbiologic mechanisms involved in atrophy and hypertrophy of skeletal muscle are unknown even though a great deal of excellent\nresearch has been done on the biology of muscle in the appropriate\ndisciplines. Since development of the optimum means of preventing\nor controlling space-related muscle atrophy will depend on knowledge of the mechanisms involved, NASA supports both intra- and\nextramural research in muscle biology. In the opinion of the LSRO\n\n52\n\nad hoc Working Group on Muscle Atrophy, NASA should continue its\nprogram, but with some changes in emphasis to assure better consistency between ongoing and planned research and the carefully\ncomposed, highly appropriate Research and Technology Objectives\nand Plans on Muscle Atrophy (NASA RTOP 199-20-42).\nAs noted, particularly on pages 30, 31, the Working Group\nstrongly recommends inflight studies of certain muscle functions\nof astronauts as soon as possible in the Space Shuttle Program as\nessential for acquiring data with which to improve the design of\nground-based and inflight experiments and to determine the best\nhuman and animal models of space-related muscle atrophy.\nThe points of emphasis, important gaps in knowledge, and\nresearch suggestions presented in this report are submitted for\nthe consideration of NASA scientists whose responsibilities include\nresearch program planning and management. Section VI summarizes\nthe research in tabular form, in a suggested order of priority.\n\n53\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nVI.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION\n\nThe main objective of NASA\'s Research Program on Muscle\nAtrophy is the acquisition of sufficient knowledge of its etiology, pathogenesis, and underlying biologic mechanisms to enable\nthe development of efficient means of prevention. Consequently,\nthe LSRO ad hoc Working Group on Muscle Atrophy was concerned not\nonly with questions of basic research, but also with identifying\npromising lines of applied research, operational flight testing,\nand associated methodology and equipment.\nNASA\'s current and planned research in this field, perhaps modified and augmented by adoption of some of the suggested\nresearch approaches in this report, should provide the necessary\nknowledge for solution of the problem. However, shortcuts to discovery of the basic mechanisms of space-related muscle atrophy are\nunlikely to emerge. Therefore, muscle atrophy, which is a significant biomedical problem of space flight, justifies a sustained,\nvigorous program of research, including long-term studies, as a\npart of NASA\'s major enterprises in space.\nThe suggestions of the ad hoc Group that are presented in\nSection V are recapitulated in brief in Table 6. In each of the\nfour groups of categories shown in Table 6 (which differ intentionally from the headings used in Section V), the suggested priority is in descending order from the top of each list.\n\n55\n\nTable 6. Proposed Orders* of Priority of Research Suggested by\nthe ad hoc Working Group on Muscle Atrophy\n\nA.\n\nBIOCHEMISTRY, ENDOCRINOLOGY, METABOLISM (see p.21-27; 29; 31-35)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMechanisms that induce muscle hypertrophy in exercise may\nalso be involved in muscle atrophy resulting from inactivity or under-use. Attempts should be made to identify\nspecific stimuli generated by exercise and to determine\nhow they signal the genes to induce protein synthesis.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAs one approach toward discovering basic mechanisms of\nmuscle hypertrophy and atrophy, the role of lysosomes in\nmuscle metabolism should be investigated from a broad\npoint of view.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAdditional studies of the effects on muscle of altered\nlevels of hormones and their receptor sensitivities\ninduced by models of hypokinesia/hypodynamia should be\nencouraged. Test specimens may include incubated muscle\ncells, incubated whole muscles, muscles in perfused\nhemicorpus preparations, and intact muscles in vivo.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAmong substances that have regulatory roles in muscle\nphysiology that should be studied are growth hormones\nand the somatomedins as well as insulin, corticosteroids,\nand anabolic steroids.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAdditional studies are needed on the endocrinologic effects\nof exposure to weightlessness and simulated weightlessness combined with hypokinesia/hypodynamia.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUncertainties about the rate of onset, degree, and duration of negative nitrogen balance in weightless flight\nsuggest a need for additional human metabolic balance\nstudies inflight.\n\n* Listed in order of decreasing priority in each separate category.\nFor convenience of presentation the categories in this table differ\nfrom the headings used in Section V.\n\n56\n\nTable 6.\n\nB.\n\n(cont.)\n\nNEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND KINESIOLOGY (see p.27-31)\nMeasurements of certain physical activities of astronauts\nduring typical days preflight and inflight are needed for\nfurther definition of the nature of space-related muscle\natrophy and for development of suitable models for groundbased and inflight animal studies. Electromyograms of\nquadriceps, hamstrings, dorsi- and plantarflexers of the\nfeet; heel and metatarsal pressures, and movements of\nselected joints such as knee, ankle, and elbow should be\nincluded.\nLevels of neuromuscular output of the astronauts should\nbe determined before, during, and after space flight by\nmeasuring maximum force at zero velocity for the knee\nextensors, knee flexors, and the dorsi- and plantarflexors\nof the foot. This and the immediately preceding experiment\ncan be done with trivial imposition on the astronauts\'\ntime by means of fully developed techniques and equipment.\nA more nearly functional measurement than that in the\nimmediately preceding suggestion would be to test the\nastronaut\'s ability to exert a maximum force at a selected velocity or, better, to produce a target force at a\nselected velocity. However, this would require more of\nthe astronauts\' time and additional development of\nequipment.\nNeuromuscular fatigability during space flight should be\nevaluated for further characterization of muscle atrophy.\nThis can be done by measuring the maximum force that can\nbe produced over a span of 2 min while exerting a maximal\ncontractile effort every second. The electromyogram\nshould be recorded simultaneously. The measures should\nbe made preflight, inflight within a week of launch, and\nas soon as possible postflight.\nThree properties of skeletal muscle that should be considered for study in the rat model of hypokinesia/hypodynamia (e.g., the tail-suspension model) are: resting\nmembrane potential, extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors, and isometric strength in anti-gravity and nonpostural muscles.\n\n57\n\nTable 6.\n\n(cont.)\n\nAnalysis of blood samples obtained during arm exercises\naloft could provide an indication of significant changes\nin metabolic potential of the exercised muscle groups.\nSuch data would help to characterize space-related muscle\natrophy.\nThe influence of neuronal circuits proximal to the motor\nunit on maintenance of muscle integrity and strength\nshould be studied in models of hypokinesia/hypodynamia.\nC.\n\nMODELS, METHODOLOGY, AND EQUIPMENT (see p.41-46)\nThe electromyogram, force, and velocity of the dorsi- and\nplantarflexers of the feet should be evaluated over\nperiods of 24 h in normal rats and in various rat models\nof "disuse" atrophy including limb casting, joint pinning,\nhead-down suspension, paraplegia, denervation of specific\nmuscle groups and nerve block by tetrodotoxin. Results\nof such studies would help to identify an adequate\nresearch model for muscle atrophy.\nAdditional investigations of the utility of 3-rnethylhistidine as a marker of protein degradation in muscle atrophy\nshould be done, including acquisiton of more normative\ndata on urinary excretion rates and the effects of diurnal\ninfluences and exercise on excretion rates.\nHuman patients with spinal cord damage could provide,\nduring certain known intervals after injury, a model of\ndisuse atrophy suitable for special studies such as\ndetermining the minimum amount of electrically-induced\nexercise needed to prevent muscle atrophy. Such data\ncould be used to formulate improved inflight exercise\nregimens.\nAn animal model of pure disuse atrophy that apparently\npreserves the integrity of motor innervation employs\npharmacologic blockade of a motor nerve by subperineural\ninjection of tetrodotoxin. All physiologic and morphologic properties of the nerve apparently remain normal\nexcept for nerve impulse transmission.\n\n58\n\nTable 6.\n\n(cont.)\n\nAnother technique that may offer some advantages in\ninvestigating muscle atrophy involves training muscle\ngroups to a level of hypertrophy, then ceasing training\nand observing various parameters during the period of\nreversion to pre-training status.\nMethods and devices for measuring muscle strength, endurance, and velocity in different exercise and test modes\nshould be improved for application to specific research\non space-related muscle atrophy.\nD.\n\nCOUNTERMEASURES\n\n(see p.35-41)\n\nTo acquire data for use in improving inflight exercise\nregimens, pre- and postflight measurements of maximal\nvoluntary contraction of the flexors and extensors of the\narms and legs should be done on all personnel who participate in space flights.\nA human, ground-based study should be considered for\ndetermining the minimum amounts of strength or endurance\nexercises, or combinations of these, needed to prevent\nmuscle atrophy in a model of hypokinesia/hypodynamia such\nas bed rest.\nHuman and animal experiments should be performed to\ndetermine possible preventive effects of dietary supplements of leucine, combinations of isoleucine and valine,\nor mixtures of the keto-analogues of leucine, valine, and\nisoleucine in models of muscle atrophy induced by hypokinesia/hypodynamia.\nAn expert analysis of available data should be done on\nthe effectiveness of eccentric muscular contractions in\nphysical fitness training and in rehabilitation of\natrophic muscles. If eccentric exercise appears to be\nsuperior to other modes, its possible advantages as an\ninflight mode should be investigated.\nBiochemical, neurophysiologic, and other properties of\nmuscle during adaptation to eccentric loading should be\ndetermined in an animal model to complement the human\nstudies suggested above.\n\n59\n\nTable 6.\n\n(cont.)\n\nAnimal studies should be expanded to assess the possible\npreventive value against disuse atrophy of administering\ninhibitors of myofibrillar proteases and other proteases\ninvolved in muscle protein turnover. Such experiments\nshould include a careful search for untoward side effects.\nAdditional human studies are needed to evaluate the\neffects of preflight physical fitness training on preserving neuromuscular function inflight and retarding muscular deconditioning. Such data would aid in resolving\nthe debate between those who advocate peak physical conditioning preflight and those who are convinced that inflight\nresistance to muscular deconditioning is inversely related\nto physical fitness.\nIf possible, ground-based studies should be devised to\ndetermine the reason for observed differences in maintaining leg muscle strength and preventing leg muscle\natrophy during Skylab missions, of bicycle ergometer\nexercises at a level of 80 watt-min (4.8kJ)/d/kg lean\nbody mass versus 100 watt-min (6kJ)/d/kg lean body mass.\nPossible reduction of sensory perception of voluntary muscle contraction during space flight suggests a need for\nan expert analysis of available data on this topic. If\nthis were identified as a significant problem in achieving\noptimum muscular contractions during inflight exercises,\nmeans of improving such perception could be evaluated,\nsuch as electrostimulation of muscles.\n\n60\n\nVII.\nA.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nCITED REFERENCES\n\nAbramson, A.S.\n29:562-570.\n\n1948.\n\nAtrophy of disuse.\n\nArch.
