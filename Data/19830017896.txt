b'MERGING LANDSAT DERIVED LAND COVERS INTO QUAD-REFERENCED\nGEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\nJames M. White\nRobert M.

Peter Lade\nDepartment of Sociology and Anthropology, Salisbury State College\nSalisbury, Maryland 21801\nThere have been enough successful experiments and field applications to\nconclude that Landsat digital data is sufficiently accurate to define the\nland cover distributions required as inputs to regional planning and resource allocation models. Even though computer aided translation of raw\nLandsat data is extremely efficient, the adoption of this new technology by\ncounties and other regional governements has been limited. A major problem\ncontinues to center on the difficulties of merging Landsat derived land\ncovers into a geographic information system (CIS) that a regional government\nmay have been using for a number of years. Typically, the data stored in\nsuch a CIS is referenced to USGS quadrangle sheets and/or state plane\ncoordinates.\nThe paper describes an approach for merging multi-scene Landsat data\nbases into existing geographic information systems having 5-second or smaller\ncells. The approach uses the output from the State of Maryland\'s UNIVAC\n1180-based Landsat classification program ASTEP (Algorithm Simulation Test\nand Evaluation) developed by NASA. The structure of the technique was\ndesigned to address the problems that emerged as part of the Landsat classification of the 64,000 square mile Chesapeake watershed involving twelve scenes\nthat was conducted by the senior author as part of an EPA study. The paper\ndescribes the removal of overlap among adjacent scenes, the crossreferencing\nof ground control points, and the isolation of the appropriate pixels from the\nLandsat data base for subsequent positioning into a file containing ancillary\ndata referenced to a specific USGS 7% minute quadrangle sheet. Examples\nillustrate the clustering of classified Landsat pixels to define the dominant\nland use for each of 8,J.OO cells within a series of quadrangle sheets\ndistributed over the State of Maryland.\nThe approach uses a hard copy terminal tied to an ASTEP algorithm through\ntelephone lines. A coordinate digitizing board for inputing the position of\nground control points is also valuable, although manual measurements are\npossible. The approach is quite efficient and should be especially attractive\nfor use on regional scale studies.\n\n161\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMany states, counties, public utilities and other organizations concerned\nwith planning and managementon a regional scle have integrated computer-based\ngeographic information systems (CIS) into their decision making processes.\nProperly designed and operated systems allow the decision maker to define the\nspatial distribution of current conditions within the area of interest and, in\nan increasing number of cases, conditions in surrounding areas. Of equal\nimportance, a good CIS also allows the decision maker to better understand how\nthe region evolved to its current state and to interpret trends that indicate\nfuture conditions. When relatively large areas are involved, the use of CIS\nand computer technologies are pivotal in the development of effective planning\nand management strategies.\nCurrent and past land cover distributions are key elements in the CIS.\nUnfortunately, these land cover files are often poorly defined or not up-todate because of the times and costs required to assemble the data, interpret\nit, encode it and then enter into the CIS. Professionals concerned with CIS\nhave long recognized the potential of digital format data from the Landsat\nseries of satellites as a base for maintaining up-to-date land cover files in\ntheir systems. Although there are many successful applications, Landsat has\nremained a "potential" to the typical GIS user because the data format is less\nthan ideal. This is especially true for grid cell based GIS that are referenced\nto USGS or state plane coordinate systems. Individual cells in such systems\ntypically run from north-south vectors and may be 10, 91.8 or 4.5 acres or they\nmay be 5 seconds in size. Although there are a number of programs designed\nto geometrically correct and reformat Landsat data, the time required to learn\nthese systems, the level of effort and often the special equipment required\nlimits the widespread application of many of the techniques and, thereby,\nLandsat continues to be unrealized potential.\n2.\n\nTHE CHESAPEAKE BAY EXPERIMENT\n\nThe development of the land cover distributions of the 64,000 square mile\nChesapeake Bay watershed can be used to illustrate some of the problems that\nregional planning and management organizations encounter when attempting to\nintegrate a Landsat derived data base into their operations. Figure 1 shows\nthe outline of the Chesapeake watershed and the geometry of the 12 scenes used.\nThe objectives of the Chesapeake Bay Project were: 1) produce a Level I land\ncover classification of the Chesapeake Bay watershed; 2) within agriculture\nland cover, determine tillage practices; and 3) tabulate land cover statistics\nby river subbasins. The land cover statistics were required as input to a\nmathematical model to predict the non-point source pollution loads to the\nChesapeake Bay. The classification was conducted by the Northern Virginia\nPlanning District Commission for the Environmental Protection Agency and used\nthe IDIMS (Interactive Digital Image Manipulation System) and GES (Geographic\nEntry System) at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center. The scenes had the\nknown geometric distortions corrected (deskewing, removal of synthetic pixels)\nand procedures were developed to remove the overlap among scenes. The result\nwas a properly registered land cover distribution that, through the use of a\ndigitizer, was summarized for 63 subwatersheds distributed throughout the basin.\n\n162\n\n18\n\n17\n\n16\n\n15\n\nI LI I\n-30\nMEW YORK\n\n-31\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\n-32\n\n-33\n\n-34\n\nCHESAPEAKE BAY BASIN\n\nFIGURE 1\nLandsat Scene Location within Chesapeake Bay Basin\n\n163\n\nThe existence of such a digital data base was, obviously, very attractive\nto organizations within the area that had computer-based CIS. State systems,\nsuch as Maryland\'s MAGI (Maryland Automated Geographic Information System) and\ncounty systems, such as MSDAMP (Multi-Scale Data Analysis Mapping Program) used\nby Montgomery County, Maryland appeard to be the logical recipients of the\ndata derived in the Chesapeake study. While it was straight forward to extract\na relatively large polygon such as a watershed from the Chesapeake Landsat data\nbase, MAGI and MSDAMP require the definition of land covers within individual\ncells referenced to USGS or state plane coordinates. The general concept of\nMSDAMP is illustrated in Figure 2. MSDAMP is a series of 90 x 90 five second\ncells referenced to 19 USGS 7% minute quadrangle sheets. The user obtains\ninformation by entering the name of the quadrangle sheet or sheets of interest\nand then extracts information by defining either polygons or individual cells.\nMaryland\'s MAGI uses either a 91.8 or 4.54 acre cell. Geographical Information\nSystems of the MSDAMP and MAGI types must have one dominant land cover defined\nfor each cell in the data base. A schematic of the definition problem is\nillustrated in Figure 3. The domain of a particular USGS quadrangle sheet must\nbe isolated from the Landsat data base and then a specific five second cell\nmust become computer retrievable to the staff of the user organization. Image\nprocessing capabilities are available to all Maryland state and local governmental organizations through the State\'s UNIVAC 1100 series of computers\nlocated at the University and State College campuses. As potential State and\ncounty users of the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake data base moved toward\nintegrating this additional information into their CIS, it became obvious that\nthe efforts were not going to be widely successful because the needed software\ndid not exist in a form that was compatible with UNIVAC 1100 series computers.\nThere was no parallel software that could: rotate the Landsat coordinate\nsystem; reference the individual cells to USGS coordinates; isolate an array\nof cells defining a USGS 7^ minute quadrangle sheet and then resample the\nindividual pixels to define a single land cover category for a predefined cell\nsize. Without such software, the Chesapeake data base provided an excellent\nsource of qualitative information, but remained inaccessable to the day-to-day\nuser of the established computer-based geographical information systems\noperating within the State.\n3.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nIf the Chesapeake Landsat-derived data base and similar future Landsat\nefforts are to be integrated into the existing geographical information\nsystems, it is necessary to develop additional software to overcome the\nproblems discussed above. To be useable, the additional software has to be\nfully integrated into established computer based approaches that are accessable\nand familiar to the users. Because few of the users in the State of Maryland\nhave access to color CRT-based interactive image processing systems, the\nsoftware had to be designed to run on a standard UNIVAC 1108 mainframe computer\nand require no more than a modem-connected hard copy terminal for operation.\nFurther, because of severe restrictions placed on core storage during the\ndaytime hours, the system had to be designed for minimum core storage\nutilization. With these contraints in mind, system development was undertaken\nto meet the following objectives:\n\n164\n\n391500\n\n390730\n\n390000\n\nFigure 2\nQuad-Sheet Storage Arrangement For\nMontgomery County, Maryland\n\n165\n\no\n\nTOW8ON MD\n\nQUADRANGLE\n\nMARYLAND\n\nFigure 3\nIsolation of a Single Cell from a Landsat Scene\n\n166\n\n1)\n2)\n\nCreate a transformed data base from Landsat imagery compatible with\npreconfigured Geographical Information Systems.\n\n3)\n4.\n\nDevelop interactively an equation which relates a Landsat coordinate\nsystem to a latitude longitude coordinate system.\n\nEnter geographic data from a map surface into ASTEP.\n\nSYSTEM CAPABILITIES\n\nTo meet the objectives listed above, two programs (REGISTER and TRANSFORM)\nwere developed. The program REGISTER was designed to input geographic data\nfrom a map surface and develop a regression relating the Landsat coordinate\nsystem to a latitude, longitude coordinate system. The program TRANSFORM,\nusing the equations developed by the program REGISTER, was designed to create\na geometrically correct data base compatible with preconfigured geographical\ninformation systems.\nThe program REGISTER serves two functions. First, it outputs to a file\nthe longitude and latitude of points digitized from a map surface. Second,\nit provides an equation relating the latitude, longitude of a point to its\nLandsat line and sample coordinate. To complete the first function, a link\n(equation) must be developed relating the position on a map surface to its\nlatitude and longitude. The position on the map surface may be input as\ncoordinates from a digitizing table or measured manually off the map using\nthe upper left corner as the origin. (Note: While manually measuring the\nlocation of points on a topographic map may be tedious, if it is done carefully,\naccuracy on a 1:24000 scale map can be \xc2\xb140 feet.) The user inputs to the\nprogram are the longitude and latitude in degrees.minutes.seconds of the upper\nleft corner of the map, the size of the map in minutes, the distance between\n"tic-marks" on the map in minutes, and the coordinates of the "tic-marks" from\nthe digitizing table or as measured manually by the user. A first order\npolynomial regression equation is then developed relating the coordinate from\nthe map surface to its longitude and latitude coordinate. A list of the\nactual and predicted coordinates, as well as the residuals, is produced for\neach of the "tic-marks" are output. The user has the option of removing any\nof the "tic-marks" from the registration if they were incorreclty digitized.\nThe user also has the option of changing the regression equation to second or\nthird order. (Note: For large scale maps, i.e., 1:24000 there should be no\nneed to go to a^econd or third order ^equation.) Once the map-has been\nregistered to the digitizing table, the location of the ground control points\ncan be digitized from the map. These points are then stored in a file for use\nin developing the transformation equation.\nThe second function that the program REGISTER performs is to allow the\nuser to develop an equation relating the latitude, longitude coordinate\nsystem of the Geographical Information System to the line and sample coordinate of Landsat. The program reads the file containing the ground control\npoints created above and a least-square file is applied to the points to\ndevelop a simple linear transformation of the form:\n\n167\n\nX = C(l) + C(2)Y + C(3)X\nY = C(9) + C(10)Y\n\nwhere X and Y are the estimated sample and line values in the Landsat coordinate system, X and Y are the observed values of longitude and latitude\n(digitized coordinates) in the CIS coordinate system, and C(l), C(2)...C(N)\nare the coefficients fo the transformation equation expressed in the form:\n\n[YX] = [1YX]\n\nC(9)\nC(2) C(10)\nC(3)\n\nAn output table is printed that contains the estimated sample and line value,\nthe observed sample and line value, and the error (observed-estimated) sample\nand line value for each ground control point.\nUpon examination of the ground control points, the user has the option\nof altering the list of ground control points. The user is prompted:\nDO YOU WISH TO EDIT POINTS? Y/N. If the user responds with an upper case\nY he is prompted with: ADD(A) DELETE (D) OR EXIT(E)?. If the user wishes\nto delete a point, he responds with an upper case D. (Note: the development\nof the equation is an iterative process, the user may wish to restore a\nground control point that was previously deleted by responding A.) The user\nis then prompted: INPUT NUMBER(S) TO BE ADDED OR DELETED ZERO (0) TO END.\nThe user then would input the number (s) of the ground control point to be\ndeleted, 0 indicates there are no more points. The user is then prompted:\nADD (A) DELETE (D) OR EXIT ( ) and would respond E. The first order regression\nE?\nequation is then recalculated and the output table is again listed. The\nuser has the option of editing points and recalculating the first order\nregression equation until he is satisfied that all the ground control point\nresiduals have the same order of magnitude. When the prompts to edit points\nare answered N, the user will be prompted with: DO YOU WISH THIS TO BE THE\nHIGHEST ORDER? Y/N. If the response is N, a second order equation is developed\nwith the form:\nX = C(l) + C(2)Y + C(3)X + C(4)Y2 + C(5)X2 + C(6)XY\nY = C(9) + C(10)Y + C(11)X + C(12)Y2 + C(13)X2 + C(14)XY\n\nThe output table is printed and the user is given the option of editing points\nor developing a third order equation. The third order equation has the form:\nX = C(l) + C(2)Y + C(3)X + C 4 Y + C(5)X2 + C(6)XY + C(7)Y3 + C(8)X3\n()2\nY = C(9) + C(10)Y + C(11)X + C(12)Y2 + C(13)X2 + C(14)XY + C(15)Y3 + C(16)X3\n\nWhen the final transformation equation has been calculated, the equation is\nstored in a disc file for use by the program TRANSFORM.\n\n168\n\nThe program TRANSFORM reads the transformation equation developed above\nand prompts the user for information concerning the location and size of the\ntransformed area. The program prompts the user with: INPUT LONGITUDE,\nLATITUDE OF UPPER LEFT CORNER OF STUDY AREA IN DD.MMSS. When the user\nresponds, he is prompted: INPUT THE SIZE OF TRANSFORMED AREA IN MINUTES\nLONGITUDE, LATITUDE. The user is not constrained to having the size of the\ntransformed area the same in both longitude and latitude. The user is then\nprompted for the number of cells in the X and Y directions in the transformed\narea. The program TRANSFORM displays the Landsat sample and line value for the\nfour corners of the transformed area and the minimum subset of the original\ndata needed to transform the area. (Note: This allows the user to redefine\nthe original study area to use the minimum amount of computer storage and CPU\ntime.) The user then has the option of stopping the run to subset the original\ndata, or continuing the run and creating the transformed area.\nFigure 4 is a schematic representation of the procedure to transform a\nstudy and form a Landsat line and sample coordinate system to a latitude,\nlongitude coordinate system. The output from the program TRANSFORM is a\nfile that can be read directly into a geographic information system or reformatted by a program (INASTEP) to be entered back into ASTEP to use its\nstatistical and map generating capabilities.\n5.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nThe procedure to transform a study area from a Landsat referenced coordinate system into a georeferenced coordinate system is as follows:\n1)\n\nOuput lineprint maps of study area\n\n2)\n\nLocate and digitize features that can be found on both lineprint\nmaps and topographic maps.\n\n3)\n\nDevelop regression equation\n\n4)\n\nTransform the data.\n\nThe first step in transforming the data is to output lineprint maps from\nASTEP, such as that illustrated in Figure 5, of the study are for use in\nlocating features (ground control points). The lineprint map generation is\nthe most critical portion of locating ground control points. A lineprint map\nis limited to displaying one channel of data with a practical limit of 20\ngrey levels, therefore, whatever a user can do to combine information from\nmore than one MSS channel of data on a lineprint map is important. There are\nmany ASTEP output products which are useful in the production of lineprint maps.\nA grey level map (density slice) of channel 7 can provide good land/water interface detection; it can also be useful in locating bridges, river boundaries, and\npower line clear cuts. A grey level map of channel 5 is useful in finding\nman-made features such as road intersections and industrial parks.\nThere are three ASTEP routines that allow the user to output information\nfrom more than one MSS channel of data. A map from the norm of all four\nchannels (brightness map) can often be used to agument the output products\n\n169\n\n/TRANSFORMED/\n\\ STUDY AREA I\nPROGRAM\nOIS\n\nINA8TEP\n\nFigure 4\nProcedure to Transform Landsat Data\n\n170\n\n"\'\n\nCLASSIFIED IMAGE\nTOWSON MO.\n\nFIGURE 5\nUnsupervised Classification of Study Area\n\n171\n\nlisted above. An unsupervised classification of the study area using\nrelatively few classes (6-8) provides a quick method of locating forest and\ngrass field boundaries. Figure 5, for example, is an example of an unsupervised classification using only 6 classes.\nOnce the lineprint maps of the study area have been generated, the ground\ncontrol point location can begin. It is important to find ground control\npoints that are uniformly distributed throughout and surrounding the study\narea. A general rule of thumb is that in order to have confidence in the coefficients, there should be at least four ground control points for each of the\ncoefficients of the regression equation. Therefore, a first order equation\nshould have a minimum of 12 ground control points, a second order should\nhave a minimum of 24 ground control points, and a third order should have a\nminimum of 32 ground control points. Depending on the size of the study area,\nthe land cover, and the topography, it may not be feasible to find as many as\n30 ground control points using lineprint maps. The ground control point can\nbe any fixed feature locatable on both the lineprint naps and topographic\nmaps. They may include bridges, islands, road intersections, power line clear\ncuts, and small ponds. It is generally easier to locate ground control point\nform images in early spring or late fall when there are no leaves on the trees\nto obscure ground features. There are some features however, that are easier\nto locate in summer scenes (i.e., power lines, roads).\nWhen all the ground control points have been located, two files are created\nfor each topographic map in the study area. The first file ocntains the\ndigitized coordinates of the "tic-marks" on the topographic map. The second\nfile contains the digitized coordinates and Landsat sample and line coordinates\nfor each of the ground control points.\nAfter the ground control points have been digitized, the process of\ndeveloping the regression equation can begin. Tables I - V are examples from\na program runstream which illustrates the process of developing a regression\nequation. For the sake of simplicity, only control points from one topographic map will be used.

The user will be prompted for the longitude,\nlatitude of the upper left corner of the study area, and the size of study\narea in minutes. The user is not required to have the study area correspond\nto one topographic map, and the study area can have different dimensions in\nthe latitude and longitude direction.

The software\ndescribed in the present paper was designed to provide this group of users with\nsome of the interactive geometric corrections and data manipulation capabilities\nfound on dedicated, color CRT-based image processing systems such as IDIMS. The\nsystem developed is compatible with ASTEP input/output reoutines and the UNIVAC\n1100 series core limitations. It requires only a typewriter type terminal and\nis, therefore, available to Maryland State and local government users.\nThe interactive editing capabilities allow the user to produce a \xc2\xb11 pixel\nregistration accuracy between an image and map referenced position. Flexible\noutput formate routines allow interfacing with preconfigured geographical\ninformation systems. With minor modifications, the system can easily be adapted\nto other geographical formats (i.e., state plane, UTM) and other sensors\n(i.e., RBV). The resulting transformed data bases can be re-entered into the\nASTEP program to allow the user access to ASTEP capabilities such as scaled\nmap production and statistical tabulations.\n\n179\n\nMl !\xc2\xbb [ j\n\n:i\xc2\xab\n\n\'fcKKi* J\n\nliiji llnii!ii!\nI\' \'Ilt4r\'tt44 *4il\xc2\xab:is|U--\n\n! jl: mi i^!3! il^HU iililHil Jiiui ifrjiiir^n} Kl\n! hi5JB!!!!! liii! i^i hU! {:HK :nj\xc2\xab!j!it=rK*bM^ laj^jii^jlTbl\n\nh jf!U;\xc2\xab4^iiifn^^i\xc2\xab;{!j!ir^^^:i^4!^:\nCLASSIFIED IMAGE\nTOWSON MD.
