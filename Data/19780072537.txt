H. Goetz,\nNASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nThis investigation will use a special instrument to\nprovide for testing of various combinations of spectral\nbands and bandwidths in the near-infrared portion of\nthe spectrum.\n\nThis allows continued research to op-\n\ntimize infrared sensor systems for future Earth resources\nsatellites.\n\nOn the OFT-2 mission, this instrument will\n\ntest spectral bands not now used by the Landsat Earth\nresources satellite but which appear to have important\napplications to mineral and oil and gas exploration.\n\nOcean Color Experiment -Principal Investigator - Mr. Hongsuk H. Kim,\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.\nThe bioproductivity of the oceans is an important\nindicator of the biological health of our planet and\nthe impact of man\'s activities.\n\nIt is also of direct\n\ninterest to commercial fisheries for locating and evaluating fishing areas.\n\nThis investigation will attempt\n\nto get bioproductivity data by measuring variations in\nwater color in the open oceans.\n\nThese variations are\n\nexpected to identify concentrations of chlorophyll as\nan indication of the presence of plankton and algae.\n- more -\n\nSuch concentrations are feeding grounds for many commercially sought\n\nfish.\n\nNighttime and Daytime Optical Survey of Thunderstorm Lightning and Convective Behavior -Principal Investigator - Dr. Bernard Vonnegut,\nState University of New York at Albany\nThis investigation will examine the correlation\nbetween lightning and various types of severe storms.\nA standard 16mm movie camera will be used, equipped\nwith a photocell attachment that records lightning\nflashes as signals on the sound track of the film.\n\nThis\n\nis expected to reveal details of convective circulation\nin storms and their relationship to the character, location\n\nand extent of associated lightning discharges.\n\nIt is hoped that this data will lead to the development\nof satellite systems that can identify severe storms day\nor night.\n\n- end -\n\n'
