Good data was received until early February, when signals\nweakened and quit, probably d e to battery exhaustion, at a location near\nu\n135\n\n/\n\ni\n\n58\n\ndegrees west longitude.\n\nTtm other Goddard drifters and one made by Metocean were deployed i the\nn\n\nI\n\nBay of Bengal the last week of March to monitor Bay currents and to provide\n\nI\n\nthe Bangladesh Gowmment scientists with temperatures and barmetric\n\nI\n\npressure.\n\nThis is a feasibility study to prove the capability of small,\n\nhexpensive, drifting buoys to send back data to aid i the early detection\nn\nof monsoon weather.\n\nAt the present time, we are working on the design of an optical drifter\nwith three sensors in the 430 to\n\n575\n\nnm Spectrum to look at Upwelled\n\nn\nradiances and three sensors i the 430 to\nincident Frradiance.\n\nAn\n\n700\n\nnm Spectrum to look at\n\non-board Computer and a photo cell will be used to\n\nt u r n on the transnu\n\'tter for 3 hours either side of local noon to take\n\nadvantage of the higher solar elevation angles. This program will provide\nvalidation/calibration of the SeaWiFS space-hsed ocean color sensor and an\noptical analog to in-situ sea surface temperature obsewation.\n\nOther\n\nbenefits include gaining experience with long-term optical drifters and\nproviding a minimal biolcgical/opticalth series.\nGuidelines for the development and test of optical difthg buoys klude:\nair deployable and expendable, reasonable cost for multiple deployment, 1\nI\nI\n\nyear lifetime, use of existing technology and a minimal validation\nparametes set.\n\nThe attached drawings shuw the construction and ocean track of the Atlantic\no~eanDrifter and the characterization and typical data of the planned\n\noptical drifter.\n\n136\n\n350\n\n400 450 500 550\n\n600 650 700 750\n\nWAVELENGTH (nm)\n\nFigure l a . .Water-Leaving Radiance\n\n\\\n\n--NOM\n\na\n\n9-10\n\n\\\n\n- -#\n\nI /A\n\nm\nFigure l b .\n\nOptical Drifter\n\n137\n\nFigure I C .\n\nSurface D r i f t e r Track\n\n40" TUBE\n(101.5 CM)\n\nFigure I d .\n138\n\n1\nV\n\nAir Launched D r i f t i n g Buoy\n\na\n\n'
