The algorithm for calculating these winds was first developed for the Nimbus-7 scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) in order to investigate scalar winds during the Polar Lows Experiment in February 1984. The coefficients in this algorithm have been tuned to accommodate differences in the SSM/I and SMMR instruments.", "title": "Scalar winds from SSM/I in the Norwegian and Greenland seas during Norcsex", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T06:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910031076, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gloersen, Per"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "d039273c98464a3b833d17c568ca891a"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910031076, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hubanks, Paul"}, "organization": {"name": "Research and Data Systems Corp.", "location": "Lanham, MD, United States"}}, "id": "ca6b36e4892d485a96ace02ad19e6ad5"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910031076, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910031076, "id": "80b25579c4624effa5396f99e81d0e47", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
