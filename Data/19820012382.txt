Kyushu Univ.\n1. Introduction\n\nGreat things are expected of functional membranes. The role\nof functional membranes is expected to increase in fields\nincluding resources, energy and environment in the 19801s.\nExamples include recovery using liquid membranes of wet type\nalloys and precious metals, beginning with uranium, from the sea\nand concentration of uranium 235 by ion exchange membranes in the\nfield of resources, effective utilization of solar energy, highly\nefficient, selective gas-liquid separation in the field of energy\nand highly sensitive sensors in the field of the environment. It\nis difficult to dettermine which of these functional membrane\ntechnologies is directly applicable t) organic synthetic\nchemistry. Thus, we will explain the present circumstances\ninvolving functional membranes and future developmental trends\nwithout dealing with that question.\n2, Functional Polymer Membranes\nFunctional membranes can be classified into three types\nbased on the material (medium). They are polymer membranes\n(solid membranes), liquid membranes and bilayer membranes. We\nwill discuss polymer membranes here. Nakagawa h=s summarized\nfunctional polymer membranes and their fields of application, and\nhas cited the highest values of the various types of functions\n[1]. Table 1 reproduces the majority of the table of Nakagawa.\nAmong these, conductive membranes, photosensitive membranes and\noptical membranes have no direct relation with the details of\n\n* Numbers in the margin indicate pagination in the Japanese text.\n1\n\nit\t\n\n^^^\'^,- ,^,\t\n\n^^\t\n\n^\n\n^ ti ar\t\n\n,tr ^\t\n\n^\t\n\n4^\t\n\nP\n\nthis paper. Water- and solute permeable membranes and others\nbelow those pertain to the organic synthetic chemistry\nindustry. The first water-solute permeable membrane is used in\nreverse osmosis, but this is a technique which has already been\napplied practically. Table 2 illustrates the many examples of\napplication related to the synthetic chemical industry\n\n[\n\n2]. The\n\nrange of application is broad, including production of pure water\nby purification of sea water or brackish water, separationconcentration - refining of products in the food industry,\nfermentation_ industry and drug industry, oil-water separation\naccompanying treatment of waste water in the petrochemical, pulp,\nfiber and food in dustries, recovery of valuable plants and\nreutilization of water etc.. The membranous materials begin with\ncellulose acetate, and in recent years, materials which can be\nused under severe conditions, including high temperatures and\nstrong acidity, such as aromatic polyamides, polysulfonates and\npolybenzoimidazolone have been developed.\nGas permeable membranes are used in separation of gas\nblends. The initial example was the hollow filament module for\nhydrogen separation which was developed by DuPont in 1968. This\nwas Produced to recover the non-reactive fraction of hydrogen\nused in desulfurization of petroleum. The membranous material\nwas polyethylene terephthalate, and the helium recovery device\ndeveloped subsequently in Japan was a hollow filament similarly\nusing polyethylene terephthalate. In addition, PEG-bisphenyl A\ncopolymer membranes have been tested for separation of H 2 S from\nN 2 and S0 2 from N 2 [1].\n/478\n\n2\n\n^ ^\n\n\t\n\n,\xe2\x96\xba\t\n\n,\n\n!^\t\n\nt\t\n\n\'\t\n\n3R\nAr\n\ny\tT\n\n\'^\n4`\'\n\n`_\t\n\n`F\t\n\n_\t\n\ny^\t\n\ndh\n\nTable 1 functional pulynter membranes and their industrial applications".\nMembrane function\n\nIndustrial apphcmien\n\nconductive. senriconductive\t\n\xe2\x80\x94 - ---photoconductive\nphotosensitive .electron scnsitivc,X- ray sensitive\n\nsolar cell, long-life cell, electronic device -- `photocopy, information storage\nintegrated cireuil,metal process irig .photo printing\n\npyroelectric,piezoelecttic\n\nsenser, transducer\n\noptical\nanti- radiation\npermeation of water and other solutes\n\noptoelcct roll ics\n\ninsulating material for reactor, food preservation\ndesalination, industrial water treatment\noxygen enrichment, hydrogen separation\n\ngas E ermeation\npermr ation of organic litioids\ncazyme-\n\nseparation of azeotropic mixtures\nelectrolysis, uranium enrichment\nproduction of amino acids and saccharides, bioreactor\n\nphotochemical\n\nwater decomposition\n\nion exchange\n\nbound\nmicroorganism, antigen-antibody\n\nbiosenser\n\nTable 2 Applications of reverse osmosis".\n,use\n\nSpecific field\n\nwater production\n\npretreatment of industrial water, production of ultra - pure water\n\nseparation, concentration\n\nand purification\n\nseparation and concentration of amino acids\ntreatment of fermentation mixtures\n\nmedical and medicinal\nreclamation from spent water\n\nwater\nproduction, of\t\nrecovery of fi,,,^ a and xylose in pulp industry\ntreatment of alcohol distillate, reagent recovery from photographic\n\nsolutions\nseparation of oil and water\t\n\ntreatment of spent emulsion and pet-ochrmical waste\n\ntextile\t\n\nremoval of dyes surfactants, etc from spe n t water\n\nSeparation of organic liquids using polymer membranes has\nlong been examined on blends of styrene and ethyibenzene as well\nas blends of dienes and alkenes. Subsequently, the recovery of\norganic solvents from blends of organic solvents and water, from\nazeotropic blends and blends of organic liquids near the boiling\npoint has h-en examined from the viewpoint of energy saving. For\ne.:ample, membranes with 92 wt.% of polyvinyl pyrrolidone grafted\nonto porous teflon have been discovered to be very effective in\nseparation of water and dioxane [3].\nResearch into ion exchange membranes began in the 1950\'x,\nand they were developed in Europe and the United States pri;fiarily\nfor desalination and purification of salt water, while in Japan,\nthey were developed for salt production technology through\nelectrodialysis of sea water.\n\n\t\n\nOF POOR Q,^.:.i Y\n\nOF POOR\n3\n\nmay!!\n\np\n9\n\n11\t\n\nA\'4 .\n\nA\n\nThe applicable technology of ion exchange membranes is based\non the following three main principles according to Imoo [4].\nThe first is separation and recovery of solutes by diffusion\ndialysis utilizing the differences in concentrations of solutes.\nThe second is the separation and recovery of solutes by\nelectrodialysis utilizing electrical energy. The third is the\nproduction of oxidation-reduction products by the electrode\nreaction wc.ich occurs subsequently in electrodialysis. Table 3\nsummarizes typical examples of techniques based on those\nprinciples.\nContinuous mass tranafer through separation concentrationdilution diffusion of ions is easily implemented in\nelectrodialysis, and neutral molecules and ions can be separated.\nMutual separation and concentration of anions and cations with\ndifferent signs can be effected simultaneously using a device\nwith a multi-chamber structure which alternately combines cation\nexchange membranes and anion exchange membranes. One example is\nthe case of the metathesis reaction by electrodialysis \t\n\n+\n\nillustrated in figure 1 [5].\nKC1 + NaNO 3 -> KNO 3 + NaCl\t\n\n(1)\n\nIn addition, highly selective permeable membranes capable of\nseparation-concentration of monovalent and polyvalent ions of the\nsame sign have also been perfected. Monovalent anionic selective\nmembranes have been formed from organic electrolyte thin\nmembranes with cation exchange groups on the surface of\nconventional anion exchange membranes, and Cl- (permeable) and\nSO4 3- (non-permeable) could be separated by electrodialysis.\nConversely, separation of Na + , K + (permeable) and Ca t+ , Mg 2+\n(non-permeable) has been possible when organic electrolyte thin\nfilms with anion exchange properties have been formed on the\nsurface of cation exchange membranes [4].\n\n4\n\n\t\n\nIon selective permeability h as been accomplished by \t\n\n/479\n\ncombining ion exchange groups with reverse osmotic membranes,\nleading to the development of new ion selective permeable reverse\nosmotic membranes. Furthermore, the process combining ion\nexchange membrane electrodialysis and reverse osmosis for\ndesalination of various types of salt solutions such as\nregenerated waste liquid of ion exchange resin has recently\nattracted attention.\nApplication of ion-exchange membr arms".\n\nTable\t\n\nTechnology\n\nPrinciple\t\n1.\n\nacid recovery from spent acids containing metal inns\n\ndialysis\t\n\nrecovery of sulfuric acid in the production of caprolactam\nconcent.ation-gradient cell using sea water\nsalt production from sea water \xe2\x80\x94 --- - --desalination\n\n2. electrodialysis\t\n\nmetal recovery from spent electroplating solution\n3. elect r odialysis\t\n\nproduction of adiponitrile by elec trolytic dimerization f\n\nelectrode reaction\t\n\nreduction of uranium\nproduction of alkali and chlorine\n\n---------\t\n\nN.CI - ----\n\nKNO.\t\nA\t\nAA C\t\nr\n\n\xc2\xae\n\nK\'\t\n\nA\n\nNi\n\t\n\n8\n\nCI s---\n\nN0.\t\ni\nt\t\nN.NO.\t\n\nt\t\nKCI\t\n\n}\n1\nKCI\n\nFig. 1 Metathesis reaction by electrodialysis.\n\nC: cation exchange membrne\nA:anion exchange membrane\n\nOne example of the third principle, specifically an example\nof combination of electrodialysis and the electrode reaction, is\nthe production of adiponitrile.\n2 Cff,=CH \xe2\x80\x94\' 2}t NC- Cfi,CH,Cll,CI!,-CN\n1\n\nCN\t\n\n^2^\n\n(2)\n\n5\n\nTwo types of methods have been developed, the Monsanto\nmethod (6] and the method of Asahi Kasei [7], and salts with high\nconductivity and little affinity for oily phases such as ammonium\nsulfate are used as the electrolytic supporting electrolyte in\nthe emulsion method of Asahi Kasei.

Li q uid Membrane and Selective Trans port Membranes\nThe separation and concentration of many neutral molecules\nand of ions are possible through polymer membranes typified by\nreverse osmosis membranes and ion exchange membranes, but the\nseparation mechanism is controlled by physical factors including\nincorporation (dissolution) in the membrane and diffusion.\n\n6\n\nSpecific interactions between the membrane media and the\nchemicals to be separated must arise for specific separation and\ntransport by membranes. Numerous conditions must be fulfilled to\nachieve the objectives of liquid membranes. Here, selective\nseparation of ions by liquid membranes is first explained based\non the explanation [9] summarized by Takagi and Ueno.\nThe solvent extraction method, in which the target ions are\nconverted into a selective neutral chemical form and then\nextractfi in organic solvent to separate ions dissolved in\naqueous solutions, has long been known, but combination of two\nstages of extraction, in which the ions extracted in organic \t\n\n/480\n\nsolvent are converted into water soluble form and then reextracted\nin aqueous solution, is the basic principle in ion separation by\nliquid membranes. Figure 2 illustrates schematically the course\nof separation of pyridinium ions as a simple example of this.\nSpecifically, pyridinium ions of aqueous phase A are neutralized\nby NaOH and incorporated in the organic liquid membrane followed\nby reaction with HC1, forming pyridinium ion which is then\nextracted in aqueous phase B. The net reaction is a \t\n\ni\n\nneutralization reaction of NaOH and HC1, and this is the driving\nforce between ion transport.\n\n.a..o.\xe2\x80\xa2 pF.- A\t\n\n.r,pmr LquiJ\n.yueow yAu\xe2\x80\xa2 B\n\nw.mhnne\t\n\nN.QH\n\n^NIICI\n\n^NIICI\n\n^\t\n\nN.

The types of extraction\nreactions (transport) are categorized as follows.\n3.1 Tranport of Molecules without Charge based on Simple\nDistribution Equilibrium The selectivity in this case is\nnot great since extraction is accomplished only by the ,difference\nin solubility of the aqueous phase in relation to the liquid\nmembrane.\n3.2 Transport by Metal Chelate Formation Metal chelates in\nwhich oxine and s-diketone are the ligands have solubility\nsimilar to that of conventional organic compounds since they have\nno charge and since the covalent bonding of metal ligand bond is\nstrong. Consequently, these ligands are used in extraction of\nmetal ions from the aqueous phase.

Transport of HC1, HC10 4 and H 2 SO4 etc. would be\npossible if amines with long chain alkyl groups such as Amberlite\nLA-1 or trioctylamine were used. That is because even anions\nwith intense hydrophilicity such as Cl - or SO4 2- would be\ndissolved in organic layers in the form of ion pairs since the\nfat solubility of R 3 NH+ cations is great. The transport of\nUO 2 (NO 3 ) 2 by tributyl phosphoric acid is believed to occur by a\nsimilar mechanism.\nCoating or immersion in polymer films or the use of \t\n\n/4$1\n\nemulsified liquid membranes are typical methods when organic\nLiquid membranes are actually used. Figure 3 illustrates this\nschematically. A is the case in which plasticizer containing\n\n9\n\nextraction reagents is coated on filter paper or a net of\nsynthetic fibers. B is the case in which organic liquids are\nimmersed in porous membranes of polymer material rendered more\nreadily dampe,ied by organic: solvents such as polypropylene or\nteflon. The Emulsification liquid membrane is obtained using a\nsuitable surfactant by first producing a water-in-oil emulsion\nfollowed by suspending this in an aqueous phase. This method has\nrapid diffusion of solute since the reaction surface area is\nlarge and the fluidity of the liquid membrane is good. This is\nthe liquid membrane system most promising industrially at\npresent.\nSelective transport of metal ions can be carried out quite\nspecifically by metal chelate or ion pairs, but ionophores can be\ncited as ligands with outstanding development [11). Examples in\nbiological systems include Valinomycin, wh:.ch is a cyclic\noligopeptide, as well as cyclic and non-cyclic polyesterether\nketones such as Nonactin, Monensin and X 537 A. All transport\nmetal ions effectively in vital membranes by large cyclic\nconformations which centripetally incorporate metal ions and\noleophilic outer walls.\nCrown ether presented by C.J. Pedersen in 1967 is a typical\nsynthetic ionophore. For example, since dicyclohexyl-18-crown-6\n\n1 can incorporate K + well, KMnO 4 can be rendered soluble in\nbenzene. The diameter of the internal pores varies with the\nnumber of cyclic members of crown ether, and selective\nincorporation of alkali metal ions (Na + , K + , Tb + , Cs + ) is\npossible.\n(^-o-")\n0\t\n0\nao\n\n10\n\n0^\n\nd\n..z^^\'\n\n^^\t\n\neM.\n:\n\n+\n\naim\t\n\n^^ ^\t\n\na^fl\t\n\n^\t\n\nR.\t\n\n,^++\t\n\nT\n\nM1^^\t\n\n\t\ny\'-\n\nChain like polyethers as well as crowns which are cyclic\n5\n\npolyethers exhibited selectivity toward metal ions. Moreover,\nimplementation of selective incorporation of heavy metal ions due\nto replacement of ether (,xygen by nitrogen or sulfur as well as\nthe development of polycyclic cryptands* have been marked in this\nfield. Here, we will simply discuss saveral examples directly\nconcerning selective tranport.\nVarious types of selective transport have been implemented\nby dissolving crown ethers in liquid membranes or by using\npolymers of them as polymer membranes. Examples of polymerized\ncro wn ethers are illustrated [12, 131.\n1\t\n\n-IIN^\t\n\n^"\t\n\nt\n\n0\t\n\nv\n\nU\t\n\n^^\n\n^NII(Y1. ^CU\n\nZ v\n-\n\nCII,CII\n\n^Iu^\nOo^\n0\t\n\n0\n\n^0J\nCram has conducted optical division of amino :., ids and\nprimary amines through utilization of the fact that crown ethers\nand primary ammonium salts have intense interaction [14].\nSpecifically, q uantitative division of phenyl glycine by 4, in\nwhich crowns are combined with polystyrene gel, is possible.\nConversely, Tabushi has extracted UO 2 2+ from sea water using\nresins combined with hexaketone cyclic structures 5 [15].\n\n* phonetic transliteration\n11\n\nX-\n\n-\n\n1,90\nO\n\nJ\n4\n\nCH,\n\n0\t\n\nUfl\nO\n\n,-Ull\t\nO\t\n\nNO\n\nS\n\nShinkai et al. hG.\xe2\x80\xa2 ^ synthesized crown ethers containing\nazobenzene structures, and have discovered that incorporation of\nalkali :p etal ions differs depenc:ing on cis-trans isomerization of\nthe azobenzene group [16). Thus, acceleration of ionic transport\ncan be implemented by shining light on the incorporation side of\nthe liquid membrane system containing suitable bis crown ether 6,\nproducing the cis form and increasing the bonding with K + , and by\nmaintaining the discharge side in the dark, reducing the \t\nbonding with K+.\n\ncor-,\no-1\n\n0\t\n\n0\n0\n\nIN\t\n\nA\t\n\nO\n\nV_v\n8\n\n12\n\n/482\n\ns\n\nElectron transport via membranes is a very important process\nin conversion of photo energy into chemical energy in\nphotosynthesis.

The rate of electron migration can\nbe determined through changes in the cation migration rate when\ncrown ether is added as the cation carrier. There are many\nexplanations regarding problems in electron migration and photo\nenergy conversion [17).\nFigure 5 illustrates three basic types of membrane\ntransport. Passive transport is migration of the substrate S due\nto simple diffusion, bit the efficiency of this process is good\ndue to conjugation with the external potential, such as the\npotential in electrodialysis, and with the pressure in reverse\nosmotic membranes.

The transport efficiency and ionic\nselectivity vary with the structure of the carrier. The third\ntype is active transport in which concentration contrary to the\nconcentration slope is possible. Some sort of driving force must\nbe provided to the carrier C for this purpose. When the driving\nforce is physical potential, both reverse osmosis and\nelectrodialysis can be considered to be active transport.\nHowever, the driving force is usually chemical potential, and a\ntypical example of that is proton slope in biomembranes. Proton\nslope is the driving force in the case of concentration of metal\nions due to emulsified liquid membranes illustrated in figure 3.\nHowever, the carrier in both facilitated transport and\nactive transport acts to promote movement in the membrane, but\nfixed carrier membranes in which carriers are fixed in the\nmembrane material have the advantage of good carrier retention\nwhile the t-\t\n\nport rate is low. Recently, lactone membranes in\n\nwhich lactot.j or its derivatives are bound to the membrane\nmaterial (polymer) using pure water as the carrier have been\nsynthesized, and active transport of metal ions could be\n\n14\n\n\t\n\nselectively carried out through opening or closing of the lactone\nrings [ 18]. Figure 6 illustrates the mechanism, and the driving\nforce in this case is the proton slope.

Biomembranes and Svnthetic Bilaver Membranes\nBiomembrane function is referred to greatly in designing\nadvanced functional membranes since biomembranes provide the\nideal form of functional membranes. The function of biomembranes\ncan be summarized as illustrated in figure 7 [20].

This includes\nresponses of gustatory cells and olfactory cells as well\nresponses to transmitted substances such as acetylcholine and\nhormones. This corresponds to sensors in table 1. The third\nfunctional group involves the transport of substances, including\nincorporation of living substances, the excretion of metabolic\nproducts, the secretion of biosynthetic products and synthesis.\nSeparation and permeat-ion functions due to various types of\nliquid membranes and functional polymer membranes correspond to\nthis. However, functions one to three cited above in synthetic\nmembranes do not reach the precision attained by cellular\nmembranes.\nHowever, biomembranes are composed of phospholipid bilayer\nmembranes and protein molecules buried therein, as illustrated in\nfigure 8. Generally speaking, lipid bilayer membranes have fixed\n\n16\n\nr\n\ns\ni\n\nORIGINAL RAGE I\'\nOF POOR OU,4-\'-\'V\n\nFig. 8 Schematic illustration or biumembranes.\n\nA.0\n\nand C denote different types of protein nndr. the\n\nsubstrate structures of cellular membranes and the protein\nmolecules act as functional elements. Consequently, synthetic\n\n\t\n\nmembranes containing protein molecules must be combined or the\nbilayer membrane structure must be synthetically produced to\nimplement functions in synthetic membranes which are comparable\nto the functions of biomembranes. The former approach includes\nbiosensors and bioreactors produced by combining synthetic\nmembranes with enzymes, antibodies or microorganisms, while the\nlatter approach involves synthetic bilayer membranes.\nSince bioreactors in the first approach have been introduced\nby Professor Hori in this special edition, we will deal with\nbiosensors here. Highly selective sensors can be produced\nutilizing the great specificity of biofunctional substances such\nas enzymes, antibodies and receptors. As an example, we will\nexplain the principles of enzyme sensors.\nFirst, enzyme molecules are fixed on an appropriate matrix,\nas illustrated in figure 9. The matrix is divided into two\ntypes; the type in which the solid surface of metal electrodes,\nsemi-conductor elements and piezo-electric elements is chemically\nmodified, and the type in which enzymes are combined with\nmembranous supports and then brought into contact with\ntransducers. Enzymal fixation technology has already been\nestablished regarding combination of enzymes and membranous\nsupports. The fixation of biofunctional substances other than\nenzymes - organella, microorganisms, antigens, antibodies - is\n\n17\n\n/484\n\nL--L a ._ ..\t\n\n.--\t\n\n-\t\n\n- --.\n\n\t\n\n__--\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2--\n\nORIGINAL\nOF POOR QUA,\'_t\':7\'.\'\n\nMembranes .ith\n\ni^awbiliud \xe2\x80\xa2n,r1aaa\n\nQ\t\n\nsubstrate\t\n\nrte+red\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2Lrv.ebe.,\t\n\nd.a\xe2\x80\xa21,r\n\nG p\nFig. 9 Principle of enzyme senser.\nTable 4 Biosenscr ott\nBiosenser\n\nReceptor\n\nenzyme senser\n\nenzymeA\n\nTransducer\n\nO, electrode\nHoO, electrode\nH \xe2\x80\xa2 electrode\n\nSubstrate\n\nNFI, electrode\n\nH2O,, uric acid, glucose, sugar\nphospholipid, chol\xe2\x80\xa2,sterol, glucose\nneutral lipid, penicilin\namino acid\nurea\n\norganelle senser\n\nmitochondria\n\nO, electrode\n\nNADI1\t\n\nmicroorganism\ng\n\nmicroorganism\n\nO, electrode\nH, electrode\n\nglucose, acetic acid, methane, BOD\n\nF1\' electrode\n\ncephalosporin, nicotinic acid\n\nCO, electrode\n\nglutamic acid, lysine\n\nCO, electrode\n\nsenser\n\nimmanosenser\n\nantigen antibody Ag/AgCI electrode\n\nAg/AgCI electrode\nA electrode\n\nenzyme\n(chemical amplification)\n\n\'\xe2\x80\x94\n\nBOD, formic acid\n\nVD antibody, blood type\nalbumin\nIgG, lgA, IgM\nalbumin, HCG.

Table 4 illustrates an example of research into\nbiosensors summarized by Aizawa (21]. Organic compounds such as\nglucose, amino acids, urea, cholesterol as well as\nphysiologically active polymers including peptid hormones and\nimmunological globulin can be selectively measured by these\nsensors [22].\nThe lipid bilayers formed in figure 8 are phospholipid\nmolecules, espcially phosphocholine compounds (lecithin).\n\n18\n\n/485\n\nORIGINS \'\xc2\xad\nOF MOE C>!\n\nwe discovered that various types of compounds (7,8,9), including\ntwin long chain alkyl groups, form stable bilayer membranes in\nwater [23].\n8\n\nC-0-CH,\t\n1\t\n\n_0_CI\xe2\x80\xa2I0\t\n\nY\n\nIt\n\n_____10" "\'o\n\n0-\n\n^o/P.0\n\n0\n\nctl,o\'r-o^ii.\n\nt,\n\nC\n\n}\n\n%O\ne\n\nFig. 10\t Electron micrograph of synthetic bilayer\nmembranes.\nB\n\nto\n\nD\n\nFig. 11 Higher-order structures of synthetic\n\nbilayer membrahes.\t\n\nt\n\nA: multi-walled vesicle\nB : globular structure\nC: rod-like structure\nD: disk-like aggregate\n\nFigure 1-0 illustrates an electron micrograph of a typical\nbilayer membrane. A is the endoplasmic reticulum of bilayer\nmembranes obtained from didodecyl dimethylammonium salt. B is\nthe lamella of a dioxtadecyl dimethylammonium bilayer mmembrane.\nThe thickness of a bilayer membrane is 30 to 40 1, and\ncorresponds to two molecular chains. The basic structure of a\nsynthetic bilayer membrane is identical with that of a lipid\nbilayer membrane.\nIn both synthetic and lipid membranes, the constitutent\nmolecules are arranged regularly in the bilayer membrane.\nMembrane fluidity changes due to reversible phase transition\n\n19\n\nbetween gel phase and liquid crystal phase. In addition, phase\nseparation appears in membranes composed of multiple ingredients\ndepending on the compatibility of the various ingredients.\nSpecifically, the basic functions of biomembranes can be\nreproduced even in synthetic systems since physicochemical\ncharacteristics of liipd bilayer membranes are also evident in\nsynthetic bilayer membrai,.s. For example, the physiological\nfunction of cellular membranes are controlled by the membrane\nfluidity, and the rates of various reactions including proton\nwithdrawl, decarboxylation and acyl movement are clearly affected\nby phase transition and phase separation even in the case of\nsynthetic bilayer membranes (ammonium membranes) [24].\nThe fluidity of biomembranes determines the selective\npermeability of materials. Sim^l,\xc2\xb0rly, the phase transition of\nsynthetic bilayer membranes is applied to control of\npermeation. Kajiyama has produced blended membranes of\npolycarbonates, polyvinyl chloride and dialkyl ammonium salts\n[25). In all cases, the permeability increases discc__I.nuously\ndue to phase transition (liquid crystal- crystal).\nSynthetic monolayer membranes or bilayer membranes can be\ncomposed of single chain compounds with a rigid segment, and can\nassume various aggregate forms as illustrated in figure 11\ndepending on the chemical structures of the constitutent\ncompounds. In the future, the development of various functional\nmembranes will be possible based on these forms.\n5. Conclusion\nAbove, we have introduced the present state of research into\nvarious types of functional membranes. Among these are some\nwhich have already been applied industrially and others which ere\nin the stage of basic research. Those which are anticipated to\n\n20\n\nbe applied greatly in membrane technology in organic synthetic\nchemistry in the 1980\'s are various types of selective permeable\nmembranes and sensor membranes. The membrane material is\nexpected to center on polymer membranes and on organic liquid\nmembranes. In the future, functional membranes with even more\nsuperior properties will be developed if membrane structure\nadvances due to application of bilayer membrane structures.\n(received Feb. 23, 1981)\n\n21\n\nREFERENCES\nNagawa, T, Hyomen 18, 475 (1980)\nShimohk\'ra, C, Kagaku Kogaku, 42, 464 (1978)\nP.
