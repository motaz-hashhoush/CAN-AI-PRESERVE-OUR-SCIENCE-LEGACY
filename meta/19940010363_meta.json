Without well understood, well controlled, and well documented test procedures, current and future mission goals will be jeopardized. We should keep in mind that the reason we test is to provide an opportunity to catch errors, oversights, and problems on the ground, where solutions are possible and difficulties can be rectified. Consequently, it is necessary to create tractable test procedures that truly provide a measure of the performance of all optical elements and systems under conditions which are close to those expected in space. Where testing is not feasible, accurate experiments are required in order to perfect models that can exactly predict the optical performance. As we stretch the boundaries of technology to perform more complex space and planetary investigations, we must expand the technology required to test the optical components and systems which we send into space. As we expand the observational wavelength ranges, so must we expand our range of optical sources and detectors. As we increase resolution and sensitivity, our understanding of optical surfaces to accommodate more stringent figure and scatter requirements must expand. Only with research and development in these areas can we hope to achieve success in the ever increasing demands made on optical testing by the highly sophisticated missions anticipated over the next two decades. Technology assessment and development plan for surface figure, surface roughness, alignment, image quality, radiometric quantities, and stray light measurement are presented.", "title": "Optical testing", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940010363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wyant, James"}, "organization": {"name": "WYKO Corp.", "location": "Tucson, AZ., United States"}}, "id": "7c584ffc9b0c456e89919c1e150c3d68"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940010363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hochberg, Eric"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab.", "location": "California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena., United States"}}, "id": "ee119dcbb58a415aa46c45b7e14c46aa"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940010363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Breault, Robert"}, "organization": {"name": "Breault Research Organization", "location": "Tucson, AZ., United States"}}, "id": "ca8fabaa2aaa4aae95664a221278033b"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19940010363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Greivenkamp, John"}, "organization": {"name": "Arizona Univ.", "location": "Tucson., United States"}}, "id": "35c0b1d39e5c42d998483c2844da8350"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19940010363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hunt, Gary"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "dc08df88946d4aaf9f8334c274e176c8"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 19940010363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mason, Pete"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab.", "location": "California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena., United States"}}, "id": "63b06a6e79f34696a00bd81cdcd4f635"}, {"sequence": 6, "submissionId": 19940010363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mcguire, James"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab.", "location": "California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena., United States"}}, "id": "e68ad16709ef4203ae623d772d9f8e0d"}, {"sequence": 7, "submissionId": 19940010363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Meinel, Aden"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab.", "location": "California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena., United States"}}, "id": "efcc7d77a5334fffbb2e05846b0889b8"}, {"sequence": 8, "submissionId": 19940010363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Morris, Mike"}, "organization": {"name": "Rochester Univ.", "location": "NY., United States"}}, "id": "897d2ad99cb64dcaa45ce73c5da6313d"}, {"sequence": 9, "submissionId": 19940010363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Scherr, Larry"}, "organization": {"name": "Aerojet Electrosystems Co.", "location": "Azusa, CA., United States"}}, "id": "0018ea6510d845449c9c5076f3e0b953"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940010363, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940010363, "id": "42ac1942d48a46aea198051b39e43993", "publicationName": "JPL, Workshop Proceedings: Optical Systems Technology for Space Astrophysics in the 21st Century, Volume 3", "publicationDate": "1992-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940010076, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Scattering calculations and confining interactions", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940010363.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940010363/downloads/19940010363.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940010363/downloads/19940010363.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940010363/downloads/19940010363.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
