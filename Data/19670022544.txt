Shawe\nI\n\nA s the number in complexity of satellites continue to increase, the pointwill\nbe reached where stations will be overwhelmed. Double facilities are already\nbeing provided at critical stations such as Rosman and Fairbanks. Some switching techniques are being incorporated to make better use of the equipment. It is\nfelt that by judicious use of automatic equipment to supplement man in some repetitious tasks, station operations may occur more swiftly and passes be handled\nmore e\xe2\x82\xacficiently resulting in greater station capacity with little added manpower.\n\nAutomation as used herein follows Webster\' s definition: \'Automatically\ncontrolled operation of an apparatus o r system by mechanical o r electronic devices that take the place of human organs of observation, effort, and decision."\nThere are a number of possible automated operations listed on the attached\n.\nTable 1\n\nTABLE 1\nAutomated Operations\nStation Switchover (30 see)\nStation Pre-pass Checkout\nSatellite Pass\nTracking\nData Recording\nSpacecraft Status Analysis\nSpacecraft Commanding\nStation Post-Pass Checkout\nStation Input/Output\nScheduling\nEquipment Status\nMission Control (OPPLANS)\nEmergency Control\nData Transmission\nStation Maintenance\n1\n\nStation switchover, presently 15 minutes, might be reduced to 30 seconds.\nAfter the switchover has occured equipment configuration and status can be\nverified by means of a station pre-pass checkout. During the satellite pass\nfunctions such as tracking, data recording, spacecraft status analysis, and\nspacecraft commanding proceed handling large amounts of data, but in many\ncases require a minimum of human intervention. Upon completion of a pass,\nthe station performance may again be evaluated in a post-pass checkout. Many\nof the station input/output functions are perfunctory. Station scheduling needs\nto be communicated and listed; equipment status determined and transmitted\nto OPSCOM; mission control translated to action; emergency control inserted\ninto operation plan; and all types of data transmitted with minimum e r r o r between central and remote stations. Station maintenance can be scheduled and\nperformed using the switching system and siinulators for connection of various\nequipments and generation of standard waveforms.\nIf automation is applied discriminately to STADAN and control centers,\nwhat advantages and disadvantages might accrue? These are listed on Table 2.\nNote the apparent conflict between higher station reliability as an advantage\nan4 lower station reliabiltiy as a disadvantage. Higher station reliability can\no c h r as a result of improved testing techniques, components, maintenance\n\nTABLE 2\nAdvantages\nRapid\nSwitchover via Central Control\nTest and Calibration\nStatus Interrogation & S/C Mission Control\nData Logging\nMultimission Capability & Flexibility\nCombined Functions: Command & R and R tones\nHigher Statjon Reliability?\nLower $ Per P a s s ?\nEvolution from DAF\nDisadvantages\nMultiple Complex Equipments\nAdded Control & Swtiching Devices\nLower Station Reliability?\nIncreased Design and Installation $\n\n2\n\nI\n\n4 1\n\ni\n\n!\n\n1\n\nI\n\nprocedures, and elimination of some duplicate equipments o r functions e.g. tone\ngeneration 1. Command Tones 2. Range & Range Rate Tones 3. P F M Simulator Tones. However, lower station reliability can occur since automated equipment is likely to be more complex. Lower dollars per pass has a question mark\nafter it because this cannot be proven until a reasonable configuration is achieved\nand tested and a cost-analysis study is made of the station configuration. Although the design and installation costs are likely to be higher, it is felt that since\nmore passes can be taken with the same equipment, the dollars per pass will\nbe lower.\nIf station automation is to be applied successfully, an approach must be made\nto assure that sufficient discrimination and judgment is applied in the planning\nphases. Table 3 shows what evolutionary steps must take place. So far a series\nof SRT/ART tasks in the Advanced Development Division are attacking items 1,\n2, and 3. There is a cooperative effort in the Advanced Development Division\nand across division lines being applied to items 1, 2, 3 , and 4. An advanced\nground station study with Operations Research, Inc. is helping with items\n1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 using the mathematical technique of Operations Research.\nThese efforts are only scratching the surface and require a considerable coordinated effort in the Tracking a n r D a t a area before design of a flexible\nconfiguration can proceed.\np\n\nA s a starting point the attached tentative block diagram of an automatic\ntracking station was prepared. This is simply a compilation of equipment, well\nwithin the present state-of-the-art, put together in a form which will automate\na great many operations by the use of an overall time-shared computer. Basically\n\nTABLE 3\nApproach\n1. Examine Present Stations\n2. Examine Hardware Under\nj\n\nI\ni q\n\n3. Examine Mission Requirements\n4 Develop System Philosophy\n.\n5.

The real-time-control loop consists of a receiving antenna receiver, P F M\nor PCM converter, decision element (man and/or computer), command converter,\ntransmitter, transmitting antenna, and the satellite itself. The entire system is\ninterrogated by means of control and display systems o r console where necessary.\nThe main features which allow station automation are the switching system\n(ACESS) which enables connection of various equipment groups into multiple\ntelemetry lines and a multipurpose computer which performs the control and\nbookkeeping necessary for the operation but allowing a man to intervene where\nrequired. The remote inquiry console is the point where intervention may occur.\nThis console is associated with an antenna to retain the present telemetry line\nconcept. A number of the items are in existence o r under procurement, e.g. a\nfirst generation switching system , the universal three-channel receiver, the\nPCM/DHE, the PCM simulator, the programmable command generator, the\nantenna control, and the multipurpose computer. Station automation is close to\na reality! It requires integration of computer control with many existing systems\nalready desjgned with automation in mind.\nThe block diagram will be modified by the constructive criticism of persons\nin the Tracking and Data Area working toward station automation and also by the\nprogress of other programs listed on Table 4. These items particularly demonstrate the interdivision nature of station automation effort.\nTABLE 4\nProgram Problems\n\n!\n\nEffect of:\n1. Data Compression ground/airborne\n2.
