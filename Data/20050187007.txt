b'High-Temperature Solid Lubricants\nDeveloped by NASA Lewis Offer\nVirtually "Unlimited Life" for Oil-Free\nTurbomachinery\nThe NASA Lewis Research Center is capitalizing on breakthroughs in foil air bearing\nperformance, tribological coatings, and computer analyses to formulate the Oil-free\nTurbomachinery Program. The program\xe2\x80\x99s long-term goal is to develop an innovative, yet\npractical, oil-free aeropropulsion gas turbine engine that floats on advanced air bearings.\nThis type of engine would operate at higher speeds and temperatures with lower weight\nand friction than conventional oil-lubricated engines. During startup and shutdown, solid\nlubricant coatings are required to prevent wear in such engines before the self-generating\nair-lubrication film develops.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Tribology Branch has created PS304, a chrome-oxide-based plasma spray\ncoating specifically tailored for shafts run against foil bearings. PS304 contains silver and\nbarium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic (BaF2/CaF2) lubricant additives that, together,\nprovide lubrication from cold start temperatures to over 650 \xc2\xb0C, the maximum use\ntemperature for foil bearings. Recent lab tests show that bearings lubricated with PS304\nsurvive over 100 000 start-stop cycles without experiencing any degradation in\nperformance due to wear. The accompanying photograph shows a test bearing after it was\nrun at 650 \xc2\xb0C. The rubbing process created a "polished" surface that enhances bearing\nload capacity.\n\nPS304-coated bearing after 100 000 cycles at 1000 \xc2\xb0F. This oil-free turbocharger\nfeatures two journal foil bearings, two thrust foil bearings, a NASA PS304 coating, and a\nrigid rotor. All dimensions are in inches.\nThis type of bearing performance suggests virtually unlimited life for foil-bearingsupported, oil-free turbomachinery. By adapting these technologies, future aeropropulsion\nengines can run more efficiently and be maintenance free as well as oil free.\nLewis contacts: Dr. Christopher DellaCorte, (216) 433-6056,\nChristopher.DellaCorte@grc.nasa.gov; and Dr. Mark J.
