To do so we have developed a theoretically understood way of introducing measurable levels of control difficulty using misalignment between display and control axes . We now use this understanding to study the interaction of control difficulty and system latency. We have conducted an experiment to calibrate our imposition of control difficulty using more representative control rotations. We use these levels of difficulty to directly study the interaction of control difficulty with latency. Results suggest a way to generalize latency requirements across control difficulties that should aid establishment of standards for managing latency in teleoperation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130011048, "endDate": "2013-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "ef08a0e670034353a873a7c802f3b768", "id": "21ecea87a27f454281b3cce0fad26856"}], "name": "NASA Human Research Program Investigators Workshop", "location": "Galveston, TX", "id": "ef08a0e670034353a873a7c802f3b768", "startDate": "2013-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130011048, "id": "b7c1b8ec25fd4217a98c2077a3df68e8", "publicationDate": "2013-02-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130011048.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130011048/downloads/20130011048.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130011048/downloads/20130011048.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130011048/downloads/20130011048.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
