Piloted simulation tests were conducted to assess the effectiveness of two novel compensators in comparison to the McFarland predictor and the baseline system with no compensation. Thirteen pilots with heterogeneous flight experience executed straight-in and offset approaches, at various delay configurations, on a flight simulator where different predictors were applied to compensate for transport delay. The glideslope and touchdown errors, power spectral density of the pilot control inputs, NASA Task Load Index, and Cooper-Harper rating of the handling qualities were employed for the analyses. The overall analyses show that the adaptive predictor results in slightly poorer compensation for short added delay (up to 48 ms) and better compensation for long added delay (up to 192 ms) than the McFarland compensator. The analyses also show that the state space predictor is fairly superior for short delay and significantly superior for long delay than the McFarland compensator.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080008838, "id": "def63f4cc90645e299b3f1b0706bf292", "publicationDate": "2007-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080008838.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080008838/downloads/20080008838.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080008838/downloads/20080008838.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080008838/downloads/20080008838.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
