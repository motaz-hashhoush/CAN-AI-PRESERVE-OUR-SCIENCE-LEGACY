The relatively low resolution of this instrument makes it ideal for obtaining a broad view of the ice sheets, while its wide swath allows coverage of areas beyond the reach of high-resolution imagers either currently in orbit or planned. An interpretation is given of the present data, which cover the area of ice streams that drain the interior of the West Antarctic ice sheet into the Ross Ice Shelf.", "title": "AVHRR imagery reveals Antarctic ice dynamics", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T14:36:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920045032, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bindschadler, Robert A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "7cb05a5ba4ab4dd18565484d4e26b778"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920045032, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vornberger, Patricia L."}, "organization": {"name": "STX Corp.", "location": "Lanham, MD, United States"}}, "id": "602a68b629524ad093c5c6ab48c1b6f0"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920045032, "publications": [{"volume": "71", "submissionId": 19920045032, "issn": "0096-3941", "id": "c16ed99c3b6240b18e01abb591d0f3ef", "publicationName": "EOS", "publicationDate": "1990-06-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
