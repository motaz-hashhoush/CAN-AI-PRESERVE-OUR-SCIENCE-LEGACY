As a Class 1E project funded by the International Space Station (ISS) Program, Seeker had a streamlined process to flight certification, but the vehicle had to be designed, developed, tested, and delivered within approximately one year after authority to pro-ceed (ATP) and within a $1.8 million budget. These constraints necessitated an expedited Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) development schedule, development began with a navigation sensor trade study using Linear Covariance (LinCov) analysis and a rapid sensor downselection process, resulting in the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors which could be procured quickly and subjected to in-house environmental testing to qualify them for flight. A neural network was used to enable a COTS camera to provide bearing measurements for visual navigation. The GNC flight software (FSW) algorithms utilized lean development practices and leveraged the Core Flight Software (CFS) architecture to rapidly develop the GNC system, tune the system parameters, and verify performance in simulation. This pace was anchored by several Hardware-Software Integration (HSI) milestones, which forced the Seeker GNC team to develop the interfaces both between hardware and software and between the GNC domains early in the project and to enable a timely delivery.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190000520, "endDate": "2019-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronautical Society", "location": "Breckenridge, CO, United States"}}, "meetingId": "7e18f470f2d04b55a29b8d630962c64c", "id": "e9599ea0c03c4e23926d3ea212ed2708"}], "name": "AAS Guidance and Control Conference", "location": "Breckenridge, CO", "id": "7e18f470f2d04b55a29b8d630962c64c", "startDate": "2019-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190000520, "id": "e8655b84708f4551a931d66317860658", "publicationDate": "2019-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190000520.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190000520/downloads/20190000520.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190000520/downloads/20190000520.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190000520/downloads/20190000520.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
