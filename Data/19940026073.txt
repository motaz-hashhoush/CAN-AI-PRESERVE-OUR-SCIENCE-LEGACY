The user enters their commands\nthrough\nan input device\n(usually\nThe commands\nand sensory\ndata\n\n408\n\nanother\njoystick).\nare processed\nby\n\nbased\n\naround\n\nthe\n\nMothen\nmain\n\njoystick on the chair. The joystick position is read by a\nstandard\nwheelchair\nanalog controller\nwhich generates\nPWM signals to the two drive motors.\nTin Man has five types of sensors:\n* Drive\n\nmotor\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Contact\n\nencoders;\n\nsensors;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 IR proximity\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sonar\n\nsensors;\n\nrangefinders;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fluxgate\n\ncompass;\n\nTin Man is equipped\nwith :encgders on each of its\ndrive m0tor\xc2\xa7. The drive motor encoders,\nafter gearing,\ndeliver a resolution\nof 6.725 tics per inch.\nWith the\nencoder resolution\nand\ntheoretically\nthe robot\'s\n\nthe robot\'s\norientation\n\nwheel separation,\ncan be known to\n\na resolution\nbetter than 0.01 radians.\nUnfortunately,\nbecause of the width of the drive wheels,\nslippage,\nwheel distortion,\netc., it appears that the robot is only\nable to turn within +10% of the commanded\namount.\nAs a result, dead reckoning\nerrors\nThere are eight contact sensors\nsensor is made\nten centimeters\n\ncan grow quickly.\non the robot.\nEach\n\nfrom a resistive\nstrip approximately\nin length.\nAs the strip is bent,\nits\n\nresistance\nchanges,\nand the degree of the bend can\nbe calculated\nfrom the current\nflow through\nthe strip.\nTwo of the strips are mounted\non each side of the\nrobot,\none in front of the wheel and the other in\nfront of the armrest.\nThe remaining\nfour sensors are\nmounted\non the front. These sensors are enclosed by a\nsheet of foam rubber.\nThe foam fills the gaps between\nthe sensors. If the foam contacts\nan obstacle, its shape\nis distorted\ncausing the sensing Strips to bend.\nThere\nare four IR proximity\nsensors\ndistributed\nevenly along the front and sides of the robot.\nThese\nsensors\nobject\n\nConfiguration\n\nmicro-controller\n\ntorola 68HCll\nprocessor.\nThe micro-controller\ncommands\nthe servo motors\nwhich move the\n\nemit a coded\nis nearby,\nthe\n\nbeam\nlight\n\nof infrared\nis reflected\n\nlight.\nback\n\nIf an\nto the\n\nsensor. When a reflection\nis detected\nthe sensor goes\nhigh. These sensors are very albedo sensitive.\nThere are six sonar rangfinders\non Tin Man. Each\nsonar has a resolution\nof one centimeter,\na minimum\nrange of thirty-five\ncentimeters\nand a maximum\nrange\nof five meters. It takes each sensor approximately\ntwohundred\nmilliseconds,\nfrom the time it is activated\nuntil it settles on a reading.\nDue to port limitations,\nall of the sonars are ported into the same timing port.\nThey are sampled\nround robin.\nEach sonar can be\nactivated\nor deactivated\nin software,\nand only the\n\nactivesonars\narepolled.If all thesonars\nareactive,\nit cantakeoveronesecond etweeneadings\nb\nr\nfroma\nspecificonar.\ns\nThefluxgate\ncompass a standardompass\nis\nc\nmeant\nto beusedin anautomobile. hecoilsthat control\nT\nthe display\naredirectlywiredto twoof theanalog\nto\ndigitalportson the micro-controller.\nThecomputer\ncandistinguish\nchanges heading approximately\nin\nof\nten degrees.

The\nmaximum\nsafe speed of the chair is governed\nby this\nsensor refresh rate combined\nwith the deceleration\nrate\nof the chair.\nAll the\nand into\nultrasonic\nfrom the\nstarts,\ntill\nthe timing\n5Hz. Most\n\nsonars are multiplexed\nthrough\na single port\na single timing\nregister.\nIt takes several\npulses to ensure a reliable distance\nreading\nsonar,\nand from the time the first pulse\nthe last echo returns,\na single sonar owns\nregister.\nA single sonar can be read at 3modes of the robot use at least three active\n\nsonars leading to an update rate of approximately\n1Hz.\nIn the manual\noperation\nmode, the operator\ngives\ntheir input through\na joystick.\nThe micro-controller\nreads the joystick and issues servo-motor\ncommands\nto\ncause the chair\'s joystick to copy the movements\nof the\noperators\njoystick.\nThere\nare three semi-automatic\nmodes that Tin Man can run. They are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Human\n\nguided\n\n* Move\n\nforward\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Move\n\nwith\n\noverride;\n\nto X,Y.\n\nIn all three\ntrue:\n\nalong\n\nobstacle\n\nmodes,\n\nthe\n\na heading;\n\nsame\n\npriority\n\n1. If a contact\nsensor reads true,\naway from the point of contact;\n\nscheme\n\nthe\n\nholds\n\nchair\n\nmoves\n\n2. If a proximity\nsensor\nreads\ntrue (and contact\nsensors do not) then the chair turns away from\nthe direction\nof the sensor reading\ntrue (if both\nfront sensors\nread true then the chair will back\nup, if both side sensors\nwill go straight,\nslowly);\n\nread\n\ntrue\n\nthen\n\nthe\n\nchair\n\n3. If a sonar senses an obstacle less than 60cm away\nin front or behind\nthen the chair will not move\nforward or backward.\nIf a sonar senses an obstacle\nless than lm away, then the chair\nfrom the direction\nof the obstacle;\n\nwill turn\n\naway\n\n4. The robot\nfollows\nthe designated\nheading\nor\ntowards\nthe designated\nwaypoint,\nunless\nthis\nconflicts with one of the sensor rules listed above;\n5. The\n\nchair\n\nfollows\n\nthe\n\ncommands\n\ninput device, unless the\none of the rules above.\n\nfrom\n\ncommands\n\nthe\n\nconflict\n\nuser\nwith\n\nWhen operating\nin the obstacle override\nmode, the\nchair follows the user\'s\ninstructions\nexcept\nwhen a\nnearby\nobstacle\nis detected.\nWhen\nan obstacle\nis\ndetected,\nthe chair will modify its heading,\nfollowing\nthe a safe heading that is as close as possible to the\nheading being input by the user. If the user puts in\na stop, the chair will stop. This is probably\nthe most\ncommon mode to run the chair. It is especially\nuseful\nwhen training\nsomeone to use a power chair. It is also\nhelpful when maneuvering\nin tight spaces or through\nnarrow doorways.\nFor an operator\nwith slow reflexes\nor limited perception,\nthis mode allows the chair to be\noperated\nat a speed much faster than would otherwise\nbe safe.\nIn all cases, it greatly\nreduces\nthe risk of\nimpact with an obstacle,\nand the severity of an impact\nshould one occur.\nThe move forward\nis most\namount\n\nalong\n\na heading\n\nuseful for someone\nwho\nof bandwidth\nfor input\n\nis the mode\n\nthat\n\nhas a very limited\nto the chair.\nThe\n\nchair can be spun until the desired heading is reached.\nWhen at the desired heading, the chair moves forward,\navoiding\nor maneuvering\nabout obstacles\nas needed.\nIf the chair is pointed\nin the general\ndirection\nof a\ndoorway,\nit will autonomously\nmaneuver\nthrough\nthe\ndoorway.\nIf pointed\ndown a hallway,\nthe chair will\ncontinue\ndown the hallway\nuntil blocked.\nThe only\ncontrol needed by the user is to: put the chair into\nthis mode; designate\nthe proper heading; tell the chair\nwhen to stop.\nCurrently\nall three\ncommands\nare\nexecuted by pressing a button at the desired time, but\nthey could as easily be commanded\nby monitoring\neye\nblinks or a sip/puff\ncontroller.\nThe move to X,Y position\nmode allows the user to\nspecify a specific position\nin absolute\ncoordinates\nfor\nthe chair to go to. A heading\nto the desired point\nis calculated,\nthe chair turns\nto that\nheading\nand\nthen moves forward much as in the previous\nmode.\nObstacles\nare avoided,\nand after each deviation,\nthe\nchair heads straight\nfor the goal location.\nThis mode\nis meant to be used only in situations\nwhere there is\n\n409\n\na mostlyclearpathtowards\nthegoallocation.Togo\nto locations involve\nthat\ngoingaround\ncorners,\ndowncorridors,\netc.,it is bestto inputa series flocations\no\nrepresenting\nwaypoints\nforthe robotto follow.\n3\nTin Man\n\nhas\n\nFuture\n\ntwo major\n\nWork\n\nshortcomings\n\nthat\n\nprevent\n\nit\n\nfrom being a useful device for the mobility\nimpaired:\nthe current\nuser interface\nand the current handling\nof\nraised obstacles\nsuch as tables and desks.\nThe\n\ncurrent\n\nuser\n\ninterface\n\njoystick\nand menu with\nmicro-controller\nboard.\n\nDocking:\nthe chair\nwould\napproach\nan object\nin\nfront, slow down and stop at first contact.\nIf the\nobject was a table or a desk, the chair would slow\nand then stop when it was a prespecified\ndistance\nunder the object.\n\nis all\n\nrun\n\nthrough\n\na\n\ntwo selector\nbuttons\non the\nIn order to switch between\n\nAutomated\nSating:\nthese functions\nwould prevent\nthe chair from moving too quickly\nover bumpy\nsurfaces\nor going over terrain\nthat might cause\ntipover.\nBoth functions\ncould be implemented\nusing roll and pitch "3-position"\nsensors.\nPath\n\nmodes,\nor set specific\nX,Y positions,\na level of\ndexterity,\nvisual acuity, and flexibility\nis required\nthat\nis inconsistent\nwith the targeted\nuser group.\nThese\nproblems\ncan be easily overcome\nby repositioning\nthe\ncontrol\npanel on the chair\'s\narmrest,\nusing larger\nbuttons\nand a larger, backlit display.\nA more\nserious\nshortcoming\nis that\nthe vast\nmajority\nof obstacle\nsensors are located\nnear to the\nground,\nwhere the vast majority\nof obstacles\nare to\nbe found.\nHowever,\ncommon\nobjects\nsuch as tables\nand desks, which may have clearance\nadequate\nfor the\nchair, do not have adequate\nclearance\nfor the user. We\nbelieve that an upward looking sonar would be able to\ndetect when the chair is starting\nto go under an object\nwithout\nadequate\nclearance\nfor the user. When this\ncondition\nis detected,\nappropriate\naction could then\nbe taken by the micro-controller.\nStairwells\nand other\ndropoff\ncould in principle\nbe detected\nsimilarly\nby\nusing a downward\nlooking sonar or proximity\nsensor.\nWe plan to supplement\nthe chair\'s\ncurrent\ncapabilities\n(obstacle\navoidance\nwhile following\nuser\ncommands,\nfollowing a heading,\nor going to a specific\npoint) with the following:\nBacktracking:\nmovements\nthe user.\n\npoints every time the chair changed\nits heading\nsignificantly\nand then automatically\nperforming\na series of X,Y moves to the list of waypoints,\nin\nreverse order.\nWall\n\nFollowing:\nthe chair\nwall\n(selected\nby the\nthat wall at a constant\n\nwould align itself to the\nuser)\nand move\nalong\ndistance\n(while avoiding\n\nobstacles)\nuntil terminated\nby the user.\nThis\nwould\nbe implemented\nby servoing\n(when\nno\nother obstacles\nwere closer) to a preset distance\non the side sonars.\n\n410\n\nfor an autonomous\nbeen created\n[4,\nthe user would\nsimilar additional\nhooked\ninto the\n\nagent architecture\nthat has\n2, 5, 1, 6]. Under\nthis mode,\ninterface\nthrough\na laptop\nor\ncomputer\ninstalled on the chair,\nchair\'s\nmicro-controller.\nThe\n\nlaptop might have a CAD model of the building.\nThe user would specify where the chair currently\nis, and where the user wants to go. A topologic\npath planner would use the model of the building\nto generate\nwaypoints\nfor the controller.\nIt could\nalso monitor\nsome of the sensors to update\nits\nposition\nduring\nthe traverse\n(e.g., monitor\nthe\nside looking sonars so that it would know when\nit had moved through\ndoors).\nThis way, dead\nreckoning\nerrors could be kept to a minimum.\nIf\nthe chair should\nstray too far due to slippage,\nthe user could\nupdate\ntheir\nposition\non the\nmap.\nThe laptop\ncould\nbe used to drive a\nhost of more sophisticated\ninterfaces\n(than\nthe\njoystick and buttons)\nincluding\nan eye tracker,\na\nspeech interpreter,\nor a menu driven\n"sip/puff"\ncontroller.\n\nthe chair would retrace\nits previous\nup to some limit or till stopped\nby\nThis would allow the user to quickly\n\nand easily return to a previous location\nor room.\nThis would be accomplished\nby recording\nway-\n\nPlanning:\nthe Tin Man micro-controller\ncan\neasily be connected\nto a general\npurpose\ncomputer for carrying\nout more complicated\ntasks.\nThe capabilities\ncurrently\nimplemented\non the\nchair\ncan act as the low-level\nreactive\nskills\n\n4\nWe\n\nhave\n\nconstructed\n\nConclusions\na robotic\n\nwheelchair\n\nthat\n\nis\n\ncapable\nof maneuvering\nthrough\na wide variety\nof\ntypical\nenvironments\nwithout\ncollision.\nThe chair\ntakes direction\nfrom the human\nuser in a variety\nof forms ranging\nfrom direct control\nto destination\nspecification.\nThis type of chair should prove useful to\npersons with mobility impairment\nand limited\nvisual\nacuity,\nspasticity,\ndiminished\nfine motor\ncontrol\nor\nany condition\nthat\nmakes it difficult\nfor them\nto\nindependently\noperate\na normal power wheelchair.\nThe\nproject\n\nmost\nsignificant\nare: the equipment\n\naccomplishments\nand parts are\n\nof this\nall readily\n\navailable\n\nand\n\noff the\n\nshelf;\n\nthe\n\ncost\n\nfor the\n\nmodifi-\n\ncations represent\nonly a 10% increase\nin cost over a\nnormal\npower wheelchair.\nTin Man is an existence\nproof that robotic aides for the mobility impaired\ndo\nnot have to be prohibitively\nexpensive.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe\n\nauthors\n\nwould\n\nlike to thank\n\nMarc\n\nSlack,\n\nAnne\n\nWright,\nMark Westling,\nand Mike Wessler for their\nhelp in developing\nTin Man.
