This study followed previous DGCA research on the topic but\nincluded more airports in much more detail. The main purpose of this new\nbenchmark study was to provide insight into the levels and types of airport\ncharges worldwide and into recent changes in airport charge policy and structure.\nThe 1996 Benchmark Airport Charges study was completed for a selection of\nimportant passenger and freight airports and included a wide variety of aircraft\ntypes. Airport charges as of July 15, 1996, were calculated for each aircraft type\nat each airport 1, based on one landing and one take-off from/to an intemational\nairport by a non-domestic carrier (one intemational tumaround). The calculations were performed using the Airport Charges Model (ACM), which was\ndeveloped for DGCA.\nThe 1996 study does not include handling or fuel charges. DGCA and HCG\nintend to include these charges in a 1997 update.\n01999, Aviation\n\nInstitute~\n\nUniversity of Nebraska at Omaha\n\nJournal ofAir Transportation World Wide\n\n122\n\nThe 1996 Benchmark Airport Charges report was used by DGCA for the following purposes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 gaining insight into the competitive position ofSchiphol in terms of airport\ncharges;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 verification of the findings of other research into Schiphol\'s competitive\nposition, both for parliamentary questions and as input for an international\ncomparison of infrastructure;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 data input for research projects carried out by DGCA and other organisations;\ninsight into the ways in which airports and governments in different countries include the environmental costs of aviation activities in their charging\nsystems; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 background information for the revision of charges at Schiphol.\nThis paper describes the 1996 analysis. More detail regarding input data and\nassumptions, as well as a comparison between 1995 and 1996 daytime airport\ncharges in Europe, may be found in the DGCA publication Benchmark of Airport Charges 1996.1t is intended that this work be repeated every year in order to\nfollow developing trends and provide the most up-to-date information possible.\nBackground\nThe importance of determining and tracking airport charges across different\nairports has been made clear by recent developments in aviation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Due to the stiff competition in the aviation sector, airlines are constantly\nlooking for ways of minimising costs. This includes minimising costs that\nare to a limited extent under the direct control of airlines, such as airport\nturnaround costs. The annual International Civil Aviation Organization\n(ICAO) report, Financial Data, contains information about the cost structure of a number of airlines. According to this source, airport charges make\nup about five percent of the costs of large, international airlines. For\nsmaller, short-haul airlines the percentage can be as much as 15 percent. 2\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The costs of negative externalities related to the environmental impact of\naviation activities are increasingly being quantified and passed through to\nthe airlines. Fees based on aircraft noise levels and night flight surcharges\nare examples of this.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The phasing-out of a large share of duty-free shopping at many European\nairports may affect the structure and level of their airport charges.\nThe airport charges discussed in this report form only one part of the total\nturnaround costs at airports. Including handling costs and fuel costs would make\n\nde Wit and Cohn\n\n123\n\nthe analysis more complete; however, at this time, insufficient data are available\nto DGCA and HCG. Additional research is required in order to include them in\nthe near future. Current information indicates that total handling charges are\napproximately 50 percent as large as total airport charges, and that fuel costs\namount to more than the sum of airport charges and handling costs. 3\nAIRPORT CHARGES\nThe ACM processes several different types of airport charges to complete the\ncomparison of airports and aircraft types. The types of fees included are based\nprimarily on the information published in the lATA Airport and En Route Aviation Charges Manual. While ICAO also compiles airport charge information,\nlATA provides the most recent data. With further research it may be possible to\nexpand the types of fees included in the ACM calculations, but at this time the\nlist is limited to the charges described here.\nBasic landing fees are usually based on the maximum take-off weight\n(MTOW). Some airports charge per tonne while others apply a fixed charge plus\na variable charge based on MTOW. There are a few airports that vary these\ncharges by time of day or season (peak/off-peak) or by the frequency of a given\ncarrier\'s operations. Some airports include lighting or terminal navigation aid in\nthe landing charge.\nNoise charges require special attention because they are sometimes complicated to calculate and are of increasing importance in public and political\ndebates on airport infrastructure. In this paper, a distinction is made between\nnoise-related landing charges and other noise taxes/charges.\nMany airports have higher landing charges for noisier types of aircraft, for\nexample Chapter 2 aircraft. 4 In the ACM, the additional landing charges\nassessed for these aircraft are calculated separately from the basic landing\ncharge. For any given aircraft, the basic landing charge is calculated as the\namount to be paid for the cheapest, most advantageous situation for example,\nChapter 3 aircraft. The noise related landing charge is the difference between\nthis basic landing charge and the actual landing charge that must be paid for the\ngiven aircraft. Several airports charge an extra tax based on aircraft noise levels\nthat is independent of all landing charges. In the ACM, these noise taxes or\ncharges are included as a separate category.\nIn some cases the tariff differentiation is based on airport- or country-specific\naircraft acoustic group classifications (France, Belgium, Switzerland and\nKorea). At other airports the ICAO classification is used (i.e. Chapter 2, Chapter\n3).\n\nPassenger charges are usually levied for services provided to departing passengers, although some airports charge for both departing and arriving passengers, A number of airports charge lower rates for transfer passengers and infants\nthan for other passengers, while others exempt these types of passengers from\ncharges completely. Some passenger charges are paid by the airlines, some by\n\n124\n\nJournal ofAir Transportation World Wide\n\npassengers themselves. For the purposes of this analysis, all passenger charges\nwere included in the calculations as if they are paid by the airlines. This allows\nfor consistent comparison between airports and avoids any second-guessing\nabout how these charges are handled by each airline and each airport.\nSecurity service charges are often calculated per departing passenger. In a\nfew cases they are based on MTOW which is then a proxy for the number of passengers.\nRunway lighting charges usually only apply to night flights, but may be\ncharged incidentally depending on weather conditions. The charges are usually\nmade per landing and several airports included in the study incorporate lighting\ncharges in their landing charges.\nAircraft parking charges are based on the number of hours- an aircraft is\nparked at the airport. In some instances these charges are also related to aircraft\nweight or wingspan. Most airports provide one to four hours of free parking\ntime, which is usually enough to allow for a complete tumaround. Others provide free overnight parking or differentiate parking charges by location at the\nairport (e.g. remote stands).\nTerminal navigation aid charges cover navigational assistance during arrival and departure. They are commonly charged per arrival and/or departure and\nare sometimes based on MTOW.\nAviobridge fees apply to the facilities used for passenger boarding and\nalighting. In some cases this is a bus service instead of an aviobridge. These fees\ncould be considered handling charges, but in this study they were treated as airport charges.\nCargo charges are usually based on the weight of the loaded or unloaded\ncargo. Note that the passenger variants in the ACM do not include any passenger/cargo combi aircraft. The cargo charges are only included in the ACM cargo\nvariants.\nOther Charges\nFuel costs and handling costs are two important types of airport-related costs\nthat are not currently included in the ACM calculations. Details conceming\nthese charges are not reported by airports with any consistency and are rarely\npublished. Such charges are also very difficult to generalise across airports and\naircraft types because of specific contractual agreements that often exist\nbetween airlines, handlers, fuel vendors and airports. The prices agreed upon in\nthese contracts could vary a great deal depending on the supplier and the size of\nthe customer. There are a few other types of charges that are also excluded from\nthe analysis because their interpretation was unclear or because no consistent\ndata were available. These range from fire fighting service, aircraft cleaning,\nstorage facility use and hangar charges to terminal and quarantine surcharges.\n\nde Wit and Cohn\n\n125\n\nAssumptions\nAlthough a good deal of detailed information is available about airport\ncharges, quite a few assumptions are required in order to create a complete and\nconsistent picture of these costs over all airports and aircraft types. These\nassumptions make comparisons between airports possible. An effort was made\nto base these assumptions on the most common or average situation. Three ofthe\nmost important assumptions are given here.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The total number ofpassengers in an aircraft is equal to the number of seats\nin the aircraft multiplied by a load factor of 0.65.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The number of passengers that are transfer passengers d~pends on the\nflight destination and the aircraft type. For example, intercontinental\n(ICA) flights usually contain a higher percentage of passengers that must\ntransfer to reach the final destination airports than intra-European flights.\nThe same is true for larger aircraft used for longer distances between major\nhub airports when compared to smaller aircraft used for shorter distances.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The number of airport parking hours required for a given flight depends on\nthe flight destination and aircraft type (full freighter and passenger aircraft).\nTable I\nTransfer Passengers and Parking Hours\nFlight Destination Group\n\nEurope\nEurope or ICA\nICA\n\nPercent Passengers Tramrfor\n\n20\n\nParking Hours\n\n30\n\nI\n2\n\n40\n\n3\n\nIn each variant, every aircraft type is assigned to a flight destination group.\nTable 1 shows how the flight destination group determines the assumed share of\ntransfer passengers and required parking hours for each aircraft. Only flight\noperations with international origins or destinations are included in this analysis. Domestic operations are not included.\nIn the freight variants, there are two types of freight aircraft which require\nfive parking hours (they are assumed to have longer turnaround times). Also\nimportant for the freight variants is the assumption that the amount of cargo carried is equal to 70 percent of the maximum payload of the given freighter.\nAll airport charges have been calculated in terms of Netherlands Guilders.\nExchange rates have been used from July 15, 1996 5 (for the 1995 variant, July\n15, 1995 6 ).\nIt is important to note that there are significant differences among airports in\nwhich types of charges are levied and in how these charges are calculated Any\ncomparison or analysis requires interpretation and a number of assumptions.\nThe expertise of a number of persons at the DGCA, Schiphol Airport and at\nother airports was essential for the completion of this report.\n\n126\n\nJournal ofAir Transportation World Wide\n\nAIRPORT CHARGES MODEL\nThe Airport Charges Model (ACM), developed for the DGCA, is a flexible\nprogram designed to calculate the airport charges7 to airlines for a turnaround,\nbased on aircraft type. These charges can be calculated for any number of airports, limited only by data availability. This allows for comparison of airport\ncharges among airports and aircraft types. The user can select the airports, aircraft types and fees which are to be included in the model calculations. The\nspecification of the formulas for calculating the airport charges can be made for\neach airport and, if necessary, for each time period.\nThe most important data source for this work was the lATA Airport and En\nRoute Aviation Charges Manual. This source is updated several-times per year\nbecause airports regularly change both the levels of the fees charged as well as\nthe charging formulas. The fees and formulas in the ACM are based largely on\nthe information contained in this publication. The charges valid as of July 15,\n1996 were used except for calculating charges for airports with seasonal peak\nand off-peak periods. In these cases the published rates for each season as of July\n15, 1996 were used. Aside from the lATA manual, many airports and aviation\nauthorities were contacted directly with specific questions and to verifY that the\nlATA information was correct and complete. Additional information was provided by DGCA staff, various airport and civil aviation authorities and the\nTransportation Office of the Royal Netherlands Embassy, Washington, DC. The\nAirport Information Publication (AlP) was also consulted, as were several other\nstudies of airport charges. The most important of these were the following:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Airport Charges in Europe, Andre Wrobel, Institute of Air Transport,\nParis, 1997 and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 User Costs at Airports in Europe, SEAsiaandthe USA, The Air Transport\nGroup, Cranfield College of Aeronautics, February 1998.\nWhile it would obviously be preferable to calculate charges based on, say,\ncurrent 1998 tariffs, the data collection required for the update of the lATA manual is extensive and time consuming. In addition, in many cases it is necessary to\nconsult airports or civil aviation authorities to clarifY specific issues for individual airports, and this feedback process is quite time-consuming.\n\nVARIANTS\nThe variants were designed to provide a picture of the relative competitiveness of airports in each of the following market contexts:\n1. Europe 1995: daytime passenger operations at major European airports\n\n2. Europe 1996: daytime passenger operations at major European airports\n\nde Wit and Cohn\n\n127\n\n3. Europe Night 1996: night-time passenger operations at major European\nairports\n4. Europe Freight 1996: daytime freight operations at major European airports\n5. Europe Night Freight 1996: night-time freight operations at major European airports\n6. Regional 1996: daytime passenger operations at regional airports in the\nNetherlands and a number of surrounding countries\n7. World 1996: daytime passenger operations at major airports around the\nworld.\nA selection of airports and aircraft types was made for each of these variants.\nThe selection criteria for the airports to be included in each variant were the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Europe 1996: European airports with more than 4 million international\npassengers and dominated by scheduled air services;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Europe Night 1996: the same airports as in Europe 1996;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Europe Freight and Night Freight 1996: the same airports as in Europe\n1996 but expanded to include a few other important freight airports;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Regional 1996: a number of medium-sized airports were selected in the\nNetherlands and the five surrounding countries, as well as the main airports in these countries; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 World 1996: this includes the largest airports in the world based on intemational scheduled passenger volumes (an effort was made to include airports on all continents).\nThe selection of aircraft types to be included in the ACM was based on information from the 1996 ABC Guide. The aircraft types most frequently landing at\nand taking off from the selected airports in each variant were chosen. Also\nimportant was obtaining a mix of large and small aircraft types as well as both\nChapter 3 and Chapter 2 aircraft. In the freight variants, a mix of the most commonly used freight aircraft was selected.\nTable 2 and Table 3 list the airports and aircraft types for each of the 1996\nvariants. The Europe 199 5 variant is also shown for comparison purposes and\nbecause it was revised for this report based on more recent data.\nMany airports vary their charges by time of day or by season. Each time period is included in the ACM as a separate airport so that clear comparisons can be\nmade. For example, airport charges at London Gatwick have been calculated\nthree times for the Europe 1996 variant: once for the peak period, once for the\nshoulder period and once for the off-peak period.

Note that peak and off-peak periods can refer to either time of day\nor season. Note also that in the variants Europe Night 1996 and Freight Night\n1996 there are fewer airport entries for which charges are calculated than in the\ncorresponding daytime variants. This is because certain time periods, such as\nAthens airport peak period, are not applicable for night flight charges.\n\nINTERPRETATION ISSUES\nAny review of airport charges between airports has inherent comparison and\ninterpretation problems. While it is clear that there are many common elements\nacross airports in terms of the types of charges they levy and how they calculate\nthese charges, there are more exceptions than consistencies. The analysis completed by HCG and DGCA dealt with as many of these as possible while preserving a comprehensible overview across all the airports and aircraft types\nincluded. However, there are a number of differences between airports that are\nimportant to consider when making international comparisons of charges.\nU.S. Airports\nThe previous section reviewed the types of charges which airlines are\nrequired to pay for airport use. The overall structure of these charges is quite\nsimilar at most of the airports included in this study, but the structure of the airport charges at American airports is quite different. Some of the charges made at\nmany European airports, such as lighting, security and parking, are not made at\nAmerican airports. Likewise, an extra passenger tax is charged for all passengers at American airports (US$6 per international passenger in 1996) which is\nnot levied at most European airports. The question is how to include these airports in a comparative study. Some sources argue that because this passenger tax\nis eventually reinvested in the U.S. airport and airspace system (by way of the\nAirport Improvement Program, or AlP), it should not be included in the calculation of total charges. 8 The reasoning is that the level of airport subsidy in the U.S.\nis such that the airlines eventually obtain benefits approximately equal to the\nadditional passenger tax they pay.\nThere are several other differences between U.S. and European airports that\nmake any comparison even more difficult.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 U.S. airport operators are involved in fewer activities than many of their\nEuropean counterparts, such as handling or air traffic control, and their\nfinancial structures in general are quite different.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Some U.S. airports levy a passenger facility charge (PFC) which goes\ndirectly toward financing improvements at that airport. Airports that levy a\nPFC have their AlP funding reduced.\n\n132\n\nJournal ofAir Transportation World Wide\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 At many U.S. airports, airlines participate directly by participating in the\nfinancing of new facilities or even by building their own terminals. The\nfinancial agreements between airlines and airports vary a great deal among\nthe U.S. airports.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There are many sources of financing for aviation facilities aside from airport bonds, such as state govemments, essential services grants and specific funding for intermodal facilities.\nThe aim of this study is to calculate the nominal (face-value) charges to an\nairline for an intemational turnaround at each airport. The govemment passenger taxes and any PFCs are therefore included in the calculations because they\nare part of the total charges. The analysis of the financial structure of U.S. or\nEuropean airports is beyond the scope of this study. Furthermore, it is not possible to measure the return of this tax to specific airlines at specific airports.\nIn order to provide some indication of the relative importance of the govemment passenger tax, we have calculated the U.S. air transportation tax separately\nfrom other passenger charges. It is included in the ACM totals but shows its relative share of total charges separately from that of other passenger charges.\nSimilar govemment passenger taxes are charged at British, French and Norwegian airports. The U.K. tax is not earmarked for specific investment in aviation facilities, but it is also shown separately in Figure 2. The French tax, which\nis referred to as the air transport cross-subsidization tax,9 is not included in the\n1996 ACM calculations because it was not included in the lATA charges manual. It will be included in the I 997 ACM report. The Norwegian tax is used to\nsubsidize domestic rail operations, but is not applicable in the ACM since Fornebu is only included in the freight variants. Other factors\nThe airport charges contained in this paper are based on published rates from\ndifferent sources, in some cases modified or calculated according to additional\ninterpretation provided by airports and aviation authorities. It is important to\nnote that the actual charges paid by an airline could differ significantly from the\nfigures shown here. Some negotiation takes place between airlines and specific\n(usually smaller) airports that can result in individual agreements and different\ncharges on a case-by-case basis. As discussed in the section above, direct or\nindirect subsidies are not quantified or included in the ACM in any way. Results\nSome notable results of the 1996 analysis are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There are large differences in the composition and calculation of airport\ncharges among the airports (and sometimes even within the countries)\nincluded in this study. Airport charges in the United States show the biggest difference compared with those at other airports.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The charges at Schiphol airport are in some cases different in composition\nthan those at many other airports. The Schiphol charges that are somewhat\ndifferent from those at many other airports include lower passenger\ncharges for transfer passengers, landing surcharges for Chapter 2 aircraft\n\nde Wit and Cohn\n\n133\n\nand a specific noise charge (for financing noise insulation costs).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Approximately one half of the airports included in the ACM variant in\nwhich 1996 European airport charges for daytime passenger operations\nwere calculated have no form of explicit noise charges (noise related landing charges or noise taxes). Of the airports included in the 1996 worldwide variant, two-thirds have no such charges.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tables 4-7 show the five airports with the highest average charges and the\nfive airports with the lowest charges for each variant, for all aircraft types\nand specifically for Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 aircraft. It is evident from\nthese tables that airports in the UK and Germany as well as the Vienna and\nGeneva airports are the most expensive in Europe. The German airports\nare not among the five most expensive when only Chapter 3 aircraft are\nconsidered. Helsinki and Stockholm stand out as very expensive for night\noperations. 10 On a worldwide basis, New York JFK and Tokyo Narita have\nthe highest charges, followed by other U.S. airports, Frankfurt, and\nLondon Heathrow. When passenger taxes are excluded from this comparison, London Heathrow appears much less expensive in both its peak and\noff-peak periods. The lowest airport charges are found in Southem Europe\nand, for non-peak periods, in the UK. The regional airports in Belgium and\nLuxembourg also have relatively low average charges. Also notable is the\nfact that Singapore has low average charges compared to other large airports around the world.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 About half ofthe airports included in the ACM variants have higher airport\ncharges for night-time operations than for daytime operations. In most\ncases, the differences in charges have to do with lighting, noise and navigation aids.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Smaller, regional airports do not always have lower charges than large\nmainports. For example, the regional airports in the UK, such as London\nCity Airport and East Midlands, have higher charges than some of the\nlarge UK airports.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The turnaround costs of a freighter are as little as one-half those for a comparable passenger aircraft at airports which do not explicitly apply cargo\ncharges. This is largely because passenger, security and aviobridge\ncharges do not apply. For airports which do have cargo charges, the total\ntumaround costs ofa freighter are more comparable to those of a passenger\naircraft, depending on aircraft type and the actual cargo rate.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The average change in airport charges between 1995 and 1996 for the airports and aircraft included in the ACM was between +five percent and\n+nine percent.\n\n134\n\nJournal ofAir Transportation World Wide\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The competitive position of Schiphol is just below the ten most expensive\nairports and is comparable with the Paris and Brussels airports (see Table\n7: Schiphol rankings in the ACM variants, below). Schiphol charges for\nChapter 2 aircraft are higher than for Chapter 3 aircraft. Between 199 5 and\n1996 Schiphol became relatively less expensive overall but by a small\nmargin.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The position of the regional airports in the Netherlands is generally in the\nmedium range compared to airport charges at other regional airports.\nFigure 1 shows the charges for a daytime turnaround of a B747-400 at\ntwenty 11 major intemational airports, world-wide. In Figure 2, the same charges\nare shown with the govemment passenger taxes split out of the passenger\nTable4\nAirports With the Highest and Lowest Average Total Charges Across All\nAircraft \'I)rpes Included in the ACM Variants\n\nEurope\nFreight\n\nEurope\nNight\nFreight\n\nEurope\n\nEurope\n\nEurope\nNight\n\nRegional\n\nWorld\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1996\n\n1996\n\n1996\n\n1996\n\n1996\n\nl\n\nHeathrow\nPeak\n\nHeathrow\nPeak\n\nHelsinki\n\nDusseldorf\n\nHelsinki\n\nLondon\nCity peak\n\nJFK\n\n2\n\nManchester\npeak\n\nVienna\n\nFrankfurt\n\nCologne\n\nCologne\n\nLondon\nCity offpeak\n\nTokyo\nNarita\n\nHighest:\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\nLowest:\nI\n\nFrankfurt Manchester Manchester Frankfurt Dusseldorf\nEast\npeak\npeak\nMidlands\npeak\n\nVienna\n\nFrankfurt\n\nDusseldorf Dusseldorf\n\nChicago\n\nDusseldorf\n\nMunich\n\nStockholm\n\nEast\nMidlands\noff-peak\n\nHeathrow\npeak\n\nVienna\n\nGeneva\n\nFrankfurt\n\nBelfast\n\nFrankfurt\n\nRome\n\nRome\n\nMadrid\noff-peak\n\nAthens\n\nAthens\noff-peak\n\n2\n\nMilan\nLinate\n\nMilan\nLin ate\n\nRome\n\nAthens\npeak\n\nAthens\npeak\n\nLiege\n\nSingapore\n\n3\n\nMadrid\n\nMadrid\n\nMilan\nLin ate\n\nGatwick\noff-peak\n\nGatwick\noff-peak\n\nCharleroi\n\nMexico City\n\'B\'\n\n4\n\nMadrid\npeak\n\nMadrid\npeak\n\nDublin\n\nGatwick\nshoulder\n\nGatwick\nshoulder\n\nOstende\n\nJohannesburg\n\n5\n\nDublin\n\nDublin\n\nLisbon low\n\nStansted\noff-peak\n\nStansted\noff-peak\n\nStockholm\n\nSeoul\n\nLuxemburg Mexico City\n\'A\'\n\nde Wit and Cohn\n\n135\n\nTableS\nAirports With the Highest and Lowest Average Total Charges for\nChapter 3 Aircraft Included in the ACM Variants\nEurope\nNight\n1996\n\nEurope\nFreight\n1996\n\nEurope\nNight\nFreight\n1996\n\nEurope\n1995\n\nEurope\n1996\n\nRegional\n1996\n\nWorld\n1996\n\n1\n\nHeathrow\nPeak\n\nHeathrow\nPeak\n\nHelsinki\n\nGeneva\n\nHelsinki\n\nLondon\nCity peak\n\nJFK\n\n2\n\nManchester\npeak\n\nVienna\n\nManchester\npeak\n\nZuirch\n\nStockholm\n\nLondon\nCity\noff-peak\n\nTokyo\n\n3\n\nVienna\n\nManchester\npeak\n\nVienna\n\nVienna\n\nGeneva\n\nEast\nMidlands\npeak\n\nChicago\n\nMunich\n\nZurich\n\n\xc2\xb7East\nMidlands\noff-peak\n\nHeathrow\nPeak\n\nBelfast\n\nLos Angeles\n\nHighest:\n\n4\n\n5\n\nGatwick Manchester Stockholm\npeak\noff-peak\n\nManchester Gatwick Manchester Dusseldorf Cologne\npeak\noff-peak\noff-peak\n\nLowest:\n1\n\nRome\n\nRome\n\nMadrid\n\nAthens\noff-peak\n\nAthens Luxemburg Mexico City\n\xe2\x80\xa2A\'\noff-peak\n\n2\n\nMilan\nLinate\n\nMilan\nLinate\n\nRome\n\nAthens\npeak\n\nAthens\npeak\n\nLiege\n\nSingapore\n\n3\n\nMadrid\n\nMadrid\n\nMilan\nLin ate\n\nGatwick\noff-peak\n\nGatwick\noff-peak\n\nCharleroi\n\nMexico City\n\n4\n\nMadrid\npeak\n\nMadrid\npeak\n\nDublin\n\nGatwick\nshoulder\n\nGatwick\nshoulder\n\nOsten de\n\nJohannesburg\n\n5\n\nDublin\n\nDublin\n\nLisbon\nlow\n\nStansted\noff-peak\n\nStansted\noff-peak\n\nAntwerp\n\nSeoul\n\n\xc2\xb7s\xc2\xb7\n\ncharges for the U.S. and UK airports.

The market\npositions of a wide variety of airports in different contexts can be seen in terms\nof these airport charges. However, an analysis of airport charges alone does not\nprovide a complete picture of either the costs faced by airlines when using a\ngiven airport, or the overall competitive position of that airport. In particular, the\ncosts of fuel and handling are significant and probably at least as important to\nairlines as airport charges. These and possibly other costs should be further\nresearched and in some form included in the ACM in order to provide a more\ncomplete comparison of the costs to airlines of using Schiphol with other airports. This will not be a simple task due to lack of data and the complexity of\ncontracts and agreements between airlines, airports, handling companies and\nfuel companies.\n\n144\n\nJournal ofAir Transportation World Wide\n\nENDNOTES\nl.
