The strong magnetic field and the low\ntemperature combine to prevent the atoms of hydrogen\nfrom recombining to form molecules.\n1 Claim, 1 Drawing Figure\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nMar. 18, 1980\n\n4,193,827\n\n4,193,827\nIh\n\nATOMIC HYDROGEN STORAGE\nORIGIN OF T H E INVENTION\nThe invention described herein was made by an employee of the United States Government and may be\nmanufactured or used by or for the Government without the payment of any royalties.\nThis is a division of application Ser.

Hydrogen atoms, in contrast to hydrogen\nmolecules, are magnetic and the high magnetic field\nIn accordance with the present invention, an imcombines with the very low temperature of the layered\nproved method and apparatus for the storage of atomic\ncompound to create an environment that impedes the\nhydrogen is provided which is practical and effective\nand provides a very high surface to volume ratio for 55 recombination of hydrogen atoms into hydrogen molecules, and hence retains the monolayer of hydrogen free\nhydrogen collection. Generally speaking, the invention\nradicals within the interstices of the exfoliated layered\nconcerns depositing or impregnating atomic hydrogen\ncompound. The atomic hydrogen, which can be proonto or into the surface of an exfoliated or delaminated\nduced by any of several conventional methods, is colbody which is cooled to the temperature of liquid helium and which has a high magnetic field impressed 60 lected (absorbed) on the large number of crystal faces\nthereby providing a high concentration of atomic hythereon. The low temperature and the high mEgnetic\nfield prevent the atoms of hydrogen from recombining\ndrogen in a solid matrix.\nto form hydrogen molecules.\nReferring to the single figure of the drawings, an\nThe exfoliated body is produced from one of a large\napparatus for carrying out the method of the invention\nnumber of a layered cornpounds (also referred to as LC) 65 is illustrated in a highly diagrammatic manner.

An r.f.\ninput is applied to terminals 18a of electrodes 18 to\ncreate the required magnetic field. The output of discharge tube 14 is a flow of atomic and molecular hydrogen as is indicated by arrow 22. The vacuum chamber\n16 includes a very narrow slit 16a therein through\nwhich the hydrogen pass. The exfoliated layers referred\nto above are disposed with the vacuum chamber 16 as\nindicated at 24. The layers 24 are in contact with a\nlower temperature source 26, such as Kelvin "cold\nfinger", which provides the necessary low temperature.\nThe vacuum within the vacuum chamber is from\n10-9mm of Hg to below atmospheric with the averup\nage being generally about 10-6mm. The admission of\natomic and molecular hydrogen will, of course, reduce\nthe vacuum.\nAs noted above, although graphite is used in the\npreferred embodiment discussed hereinbefore, transitional metal dichalogenides of the form TX2 can also be\nused, where T is a transitional metal and X is S,Se or Te.\nThe spacing between the layers should be greater\nthan 5x 10-8cm for some materials and at least\n\n1.7x 10-8 for graphite. In general, a spacing between\nlayers of at least 1 x 10-8cm is required.\nThe strength of the magnetic field used is defined as\nB / T 2 1 Tesla/P Kelvin, that is, the field strength\nshould be equal to or greater than B Telsa per degree\nKelvin.\nWhile a temperature of about 4" K. is preferred, the\napplicable temperature range is between 0 and 14" K.\n(O<T< 14\' K.).\nAlthough the invention has been described relative to\nexemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood\nby those skilled in the art that variations and modifications may be effected in these embodiments without\ndeparting from the scope and spirit of the invention.\nI claim:\nI.
