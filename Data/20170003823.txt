b'Microbial Monitoring from the frontlines to space: A successful validation of a Department of Defense\n(DoD) funded small business innovation research (SBIR) technology on board the International Space\nStation (ISS).\nAuthors:\nCherie Oubre (KBRWyle, JSC)\nChristina Khodadad (KSC)\nVictoria Castro (KBRWyle, JSC)\nMark Ott (JSC)\nLawrence Pollack (Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA)\nMonsi Roman (MSFC)\nThe RAZOR EX, a quantitative PCR instrument, is a portable, ruggedized unit that was designed for the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) with its beginnings traceable to a Small Business Innovation Research\n(SBIR) contract beginning in 2000. The PCR instrument\xe2\x80\x99s primary function post 9/11 was for frontline\ntroops and first responders to detect biological threat agents and bioterrorism activities in remote\nlocations to include field environments. With its success for DoD, the instrument has also been\nemployed by other US Departments to include Homeland Security. The RAZOR EX underwent stringent\ntesting by the vendor as well as the DoD and was certified in 2005.\nThe identification and quantitation of microbial pathogens is necessary both on the ground as well as\nduring spaceflight to maintain the health of astronauts and to prevent biofouling of equipment.\nCurrently, culture-based monitoring technology has been adequate for short-term spaceflight missions\nbut may not provide the robustness required for long duration missions. A NASA sponsored workshop in\n2011 determined that the more traditional culture-based method should be replaced or supplemented\nwith more robust technologies. NASA scientists began researching innovative molecular technologies for\nfuture space exploration and as a result, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was recommended. Shortly\nafter, in 2012, NASA sponsored a project to identify and review current, commercial, cutting edge PCR\ntechnologies for potential applicability to spaceflight operations. Scientists identified and extensively\nevaluated three down-selected candidate technologies with the potential to function in microgravity.\nAfter a thorough Voice of the Customer (VOC) trade study and extensive functional and safety\nevaluations, the RAZOR EX PCR instrument (BioFire Defense, Salt Lake City, UT) was selected as the most\npromising current technology for spaceflight monitoring applications.\nIn 2015, the RAZOR EX hardware was chosen as one of the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) instruments\nincorporated into the Water Monitoring Suite of technologies for rapid development and flight\ndemonstration. The RAZOR EX launched on SpaceX-9 in July 2016 and flight testing initiated the\nvalidation, hardware functionality, and established consistency with ground controls.\nThe DoD funded SBIR project successfully led to the RAZOR EX development and produced a beneficial\nproduct to address multiple customer requirements. The instrumentation has shown it can be used in\nmany environmental scenarios, both land-based as well as space-based. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s inflight testing of the\ntechnology validated its functionality and sensitivity in microgravity. The instrument\xe2\x80\x99s small footprint,\n\nportability, and direct \xe2\x80\x98sample-to-answer\xe2\x80\x99 results provide autonomy to crew members and also provides\na potential viable system for future, long duration spaceflight missions.\nShort Word Abstract.\nThe RAZOR EX\xc2\xae PCR unit was initially developed by the DoD as part of an SBIR project to detect and\nidentify biothreats during field deployment. The system was evaluated by NASA as a commercial\ntechnology for future microbial monitoring requirements and has been successfully demonstrated in\nmicrogravity on-board the International Space Station.\n\n'
