One source is a 6-ft diameter sphere and the other a 4-ft diameter hemisphere. Both are internally coated with multiple layers of barium sulfate and house an array of 12 tungsten filament-quartz iodine lamps that provide a uniform diffuse target of radiance traceable to NBS. The lamps are baffled and arranged so that they are not part of the scene during calibrations. Both systems have a 10-inch viewing aperture. The hemisphere is somewhat more versatile in that the aperture can be changed and the system is movable so calibrations can be done at other sites. Together, these systems have supported numerous GSFC projects and missions during this review period. They are listed.", "title": "Radiance standards", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T00:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890018820, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lester, D.
