The program was directed at the spin-axis bearings of a control moment gyro. The bearings were tested at speeds of 6000 and 8000 rpm, thrust loads from 50 to 1000 pounds, with a wide range of lubrication conditions, with and without a simulated fatigue spall implanted in the inner race ball track. It was concluded that a bearing monitor system based on detection and analysis of modulations of a fault indicating bearing resonance frequency can provide a low threshold of sensitivity.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740020847, "id": "b11b8653fe1046f7b2c9c4a0d38588ff", "publicationDate": "1974-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740020847.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740020847/downloads/19740020847.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740020847/downloads/19740020847.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740020847/downloads/19740020847.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
