For example, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) report 121 concluded there is \"the need for improved and uniform statistical sampling, audit, and certification processes\". Also, re-certification time has been a limiting factor in making changes to Space Shuttle code close to launch time. This is likely to be an even bigger problem with the rapid turnaround required in developing NASA s replacement for the Space Shuttle, the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). Hence, intelligent development processes are needed which place certification at the center of development. If certification tools provide useful information, such as estimated time and effort, they are more likely to be adopted. The ultimate impact of such a tool will be reduced effort and increased reliability.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20060015636, "name": "Software Certificate Management 2005", "location": "Long Beach, CA", "id": "b1781d3c7c67435c88b90c51fac3c92e", "startDate": "2005-11-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060015636, "id": "1413cd67f4fa4935ad9e78185627d387", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060015636.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060015636/downloads/20060015636.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060015636/downloads/20060015636.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060015636/downloads/20060015636.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
