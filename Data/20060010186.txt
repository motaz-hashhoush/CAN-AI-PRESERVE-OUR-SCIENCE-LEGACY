ABSTRACT (Maxbnum 200 words)\n\nIn 2005, over 150 undergraduate students and first-year graduate students participated in a variety of research\nprograms coordinated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Education Office in conjunction with the Caltech StudentFaculty Programs Office. The programs give students the opportunity to conduct research under the guidance of\nan experienced mentor for a 10-week period. Students gain valuable experience while contributing to the ongoing\ngoals of JPL. Students are required to submit progress reports and an abstract, and to give an oral presentation of\ntheir projects to an audience of JPL staff and other students. This set of abstracts provides brief descriptions of the\nprojects that were conducted by these students and their mentors. A schedule of student talks is also included.\n\n15. NUMBER OF PAGES\n\n14.
