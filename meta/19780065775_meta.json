Values are noted for the relative importance of system variables such as time savings, on-time arrival, convenience, comfort, safety, the ability to read and write, and onboard services.", "title": "Model of aircraft passenger acceptance", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T11:36:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780065775, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jacobson, I.
