Research at NASA is now focussed on extending the CTAS software and computer human interfaces to provide more advanced capabilities. The Multi-center TMA (McTMA) is designed to operate at airports where arrival flows originate from two or more centers whose boundaries are in close proximity to the TRACON boundary. McTMA will also include techniques for routing arrival flows away from congested airspace and around airspace reserved for arrivals into other hub airports. NASA is working with FAA and MITRE to build a prototype McTMA for the Philadelphia airport. The active Final Approach Spacing Tool (aFAST) provides speed and heading advisories to help controllers achieve accurate spacing between aircraft on final approach. These advisories will be integrated with those in the existing pFAST to provide a set of comprehensive advisories for controlling arrival traffic from the TRACON boundary to touchdown at complex, high-capacity airports. A research prototype of aFAST, designed for the Dallas-Fort Worth is in an advanced stage of development. The Expedite Departure Path (EDP) and Direct-To tools are designed to help controllers guide departing aircraft out of the TRACON airspace and to climb to cruise altitude along the most efficient routes.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Netherlands", "submissionId": 20050010171, "endDate": "2000-05-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Technical Interchange Meeting", "location": "Amsterdam", "id": "73d7fc67aaaa4336b8e156c7c07959f9", "startDate": "2000-05-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050010171, "id": "f3d96113eeab4831bfefb9150f28134f", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
