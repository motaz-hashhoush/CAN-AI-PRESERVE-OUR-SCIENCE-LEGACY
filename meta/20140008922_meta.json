Fifty-five retired controllers were given an electronic survey where they rated the amount of memorization or specialized skills needed for sixteen generic airspace factors. The results suggested similarities in the pattern of ratings between different areas of the US (East, Central, and West). The average of the ratings for each area also showed some differences between regions, with ratings being generally higher in the East area. All sixteen factors were rated as moderately to highly important and may be useful for future research on generic airspace, air traffic controller workload, etc.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140008922, "endDate": "2013-08-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIAA"}}, "meetingId": "e2c3265bd9274e57a3c76d089352cbd9", "id": "b99edf0b91ed4b01b8a2fd42ec64c64d"}], "name": "AIAA Aviation 2013", "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": "e2c3265bd9274e57a3c76d089352cbd9", "startDate": "2013-08-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140008922, "id": "511755200900488bb9a5533acf821ad1", "publicationDate": "2013-08-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140008922.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140008922/downloads/20140008922.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140008922/downloads/20140008922.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140008922/downloads/20140008922.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
