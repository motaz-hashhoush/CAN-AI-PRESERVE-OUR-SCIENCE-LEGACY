b'PROBABLY OF THE TOUGHEST, MOST GUT-WRENCHING\nONE\ndecisions I have ever witnessed on a project was the one\ninvolving the end-to-end test for the Eking lander. At\nthis point on the project, I was trajectory analysis and\ndesign manager on Eking, so mine was not a small stake\nin the decision.\nThe traditional approach is to test an integrated\nsystem such as the lander or a spacecraft once it\'s been\nassembled. It is a complete system test, and in general it\'s\nthe way to go. But "in general" doesn\'t apply to every\nproject. In almost every case, and certainly in our case,\nthere are limits on your ability to simulate the total set of\nconditions such that the test will be 100% valid. Plus,\nwhen we got down to that point, we were running tight\non time and money-and end-to-end systems tests are\nalways expensive.\nA a project progresses, an effective project team will\ns\ndevelop and maintain a list of possible cost offsets that can\nreduce scope. The Eking project had developed and\nmaintained such a list, which included some fifty items of\ncost or schedule offsets, along with an assessment of their\nassociated risks. We knew it was time to turn to the list\nagain when the NASA administrator sent word to us in\n1974 (one year prior to launch) that Eking had to solve all\nfuture problems without requesting additional funding.\n\nTo test or not to test\nAs the time for the end-to-end test came near, Jim iMartin,\nthe Eking project manager, called us all into a meeting.Jim\nlistened to all the arguments,pro and con, about the value\nof the test. The project team presented data on the smaller\ntests already being conducted, which had verified the\nperformance of various subsystems and interfaces. Then\nwe discussed the known deficiencies of the end-to-end\ntest, as well as the risks associated with canceling it.\nAfter Jim assured himself that every subsystem and\ncomponent involved had been adequately tested, he\nannounced his decision to cancel the end-to-end test. It\nwasn\'t an easy decision; some of the people Jim trusted\nmost didn\'t agree with him. One of them was Israel\nTaback, (affectionately known by all of us as Is) chief\nengineer for Eking and just the best systems engineer I\nhave ever known in my life. That was the only time during\nthe course of the Eking mission that I ever saw Is Taback\nput his body across the track-and Jim Martin ran over it.\nTaback stood up and argued that we couldn\'t afford\nnot to run the test. Jim Martin relied heavily on Taback\nASK 16 FOR PRACTITIONERS BY PRACTITIONERS\n\n21\n\nI\n\nand had the utmost respect for him. But Martin also was a\nguy who had the guts to stand alone and make a decision.\n\nTesting my own commitment\nThe day that Jim decided to cancel the test, I made the\nmistake of walking out of the meeting beside Taback.\nHe turned to me and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know we\xe2\x80\x99ve\ncancelled the test.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI nodded-and that\xe2\x80\x98s when he picked me up, figuratively, by the scuff of my shirt. \xe2\x80\x9cAs of now,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hold you personally responsible that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a\nsign reversal in the control logic for the lander.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTaback had reason to be worried, because we had\ncrashed-not us, but NASA-a spacecraft before due to\ncontrol logic sign reversal. This was part of my responsibility on the project, and so in other words he was\nsaying my career was on the line.\n\nI had a fellow emulating the control logic. The endto-end test would have verified that there was no sign\nreversal. Now, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have that assurance; so, you\ncan bet that my first stop after the meeting was in the\nofice of the lead for the guidance, control, and\nsequencing computer.\nTaback\xe2\x80\x99s response-something that has been born\nout over the years-was that one test was worth a\nthousand opinions. He was a strong believer of \xe2\x80\x9ctest as\nyou fly, and fly as you test.\xe2\x80\x9c We (NASA) had screwed up\nseveral spacecraft because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t obey that very\nsimple rule. His position was that there is no reason\ncompelling enough to delete an overall systems test. \xe2\x80\x9cI\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care what you guys tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d I remember him\nsaying. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no justification.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut Jim did justify it.\n\nAn engineer examines the aeroshell that protected the Viking lander during entry into the Martian atmosphere.\n\n22\n\nAPPL THE NASA ACADEMY OF PROGRAM AND PROJECT LEADERSHIP\n\nThe art of persuasion\nWith all this at stake, it would be easy to second-guess\nJim\xe2\x80\x99s decision, but there was more to the story, of\ncourse. At best, we had hoped to run an overall systems\ntest on the lander that would be ninety-something\npercent valid. To do that, we\xe2\x80\x98d have to fudge a few\nthings. So, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been a perfect test, number\none. Number two. we were able to do a tremendous\n\nJim knew that a negative report would distract our\nteam from the work we needed to do. To address the\nreport, he called in his deputy project manager, Gus\nGuastaferro, and asked him, \xe2\x80\x9dGus, will you handle this?\xe2\x80\x9d\nYou should understand that Gus was known for his\ncreative negotiation techniques.\nOn the day of the meeting with the IG group, Gus\nwent into the room, and shook hands with everyone.\n\namount of testing on the various subsystem levels such\nthat we had a lot of confidence that the system, as a\nwhole, would work.\nIn most of our projects we have to make very\ndifficult decisions with limited knowledge. I like the way\none of our Viking team members, Tom Young, put it.\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s take on a tough decision was to say: \xe2\x80\x9dIf we make\nthis decision, are we prepared to defend it in\nCongressional testimony?\xe2\x80\x9d If the answer is yes, then you\nprobably made the right decision. On Viking, we very\nnearly got the chance to find out.\nAfter Jim cancelled the test, we received a scathing\nreport from the Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s (IG) office that said\nViking had been placed in severe jeopardy because the\nend-to-end systems test had been called off, and they\nfelt it was a totally inappropriate thing for management\nto do. When the IG does something like that, they give\nyou a draft report, and they give you a chance to\nrespond to it before it becomes official.\nJim took a look at the report and didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the\nconclusions. There were no new findings about the risk of\ncanceling the test; it came down to a difference in judgment.\n\nThey were all young, all about 25 to 30 years old. Gus\nsmiled, and started talking.\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very interesting report you\xe2\x80\x99ve\ngot here. We have been very interested reading it. But let\nme ask,just to help me here, what are your backgrounds?\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe looked at the first guy, who told Gus he was a\nbusiness major in college. He went to the next guy. He\nhad an engineering background, but little practical\nexperience. And so on.\nWhen they\xe2\x80\x98d gone around the room, Gus said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, you gentlemen have written this report and\nstated your opinion. You certainly have a right to do\nthat; but you\xe2\x80\x99ve just got to realize that your opinion,\nwhich is based on a total of about thirty years of minimal\ntechnical experience, has to be judged against the\nopinion of about 800 years of engineering experience of\nmore than fifty senior engineers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do pursue this, of course,\nwe will request a Congressional review, and I hope you\nrealize that you will be asking your bosses to defend your\nthirty years of judgment against our 800 years. Some\npeople, I dare say, might question that kind of disparity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWHAT\xe2\x80\x99S\n\nIN A TEST?\n\nThe end-to-endtest would verify the complexsequence of events from lander separationto landing. Due to the large distances involved and\nthe significant delay time in sending a command and receivingverification,the lander needed to operate autonomously after it separated\nfrom the orbiter. It had to sense conditions, make decisions, and act accordingly. We were flying into a relatively unknown set of\nconditions-a Martian atmosphereof unknown pressure, density, and consistencyto land on a surface of unknown altitude, and one which\nhad an unknown bearingstrength.\nIn order to touch down safely on Mars the lander had to orient itself for descent and entry, modulate itself to maintain proper lift, pop a\nparachute, jettison its aeroshell, deploy landing legs and radar, ignite a terminal descent engine, and fly a given trajectory to the surface.\nOnce on the surface, it would determine its orientation,raise the high-gainantenna, perform a sweep to locate Earth, and begintransmitting\ninformation. It was this complicated, autonomous sequence that the end-to-endtest was to simulate.\n\nASK 16 FOR PRACTITIONERS BY PRACTITIONERS\n\n23\n\nThen he left the room. (We later learned that the IG\nhad decided not to publish the report.) That was typical\nGus. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get mad; just get what you need. And typical\nJim, too. Know the strengths of the people working for\nyou. Let them do the jobs they do best-like handing\nover the report to Gus. But also be willing to overrule\nthem, when the overall good of the project demands it.\nJim also believed in making decisions in a\ncompletely open fashion, with everyone who wanted a\nsay involved. And that included his critics-although he\nwas not about to let his critics go unanswered. Jim\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t ignore criticism; he evaluated it.\n\nMoreover, he expected nothing less than absolute\ntruth from his people. The one unforgivable sin was to\nput a spin on something or to hold back needed information. I saw people attempt to do this in a staff meeting\nand that was their last meeting.They were off the project\nthat day.\nAll discussions of major decisions were held in\nopen forum. The decisions were completely open and\nthe reasons and results were made known to the entire\nproject and to NASA management. Jim\xe2\x80\x99s requirement\nfor open communication within and outside of the\nproject permeated the Eking project community. In that\nvein, the decision and the reasons for the end-to-end\ntest cancellation were immediately made known to the\nCenter Director, the Associate Administrator, and the\n\nNASA Administrator. They also knew that it would save\n$1.1 million of additional funds, and they knew the\nrisks associated with it.\n\nAnd in the end\n\n...\n\nAfter that famous decision, we used to say that we were\nstill going to perform the lander end-to-end test-it\nwould just happen on Mars. When this \xe2\x80\x9ctest\xe2\x80\x9d finally\ntook place on July 20, 1976, and the first pictures\nstarted coming back, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there was a dry eye\nin that whole Space Flight Operations Facility.\n0\n\nLESSONS\nTruly good decisions can only be made when there is\nfree and open communication and information\nexchange throughout the project.\nTeam members are more likely to accept decisions,\neven if they do not agree with them, when they understand why and how decisions are made.\nAfter discussing controversial issues with team\nmembers, project managers must have the courage to\nmake unpopular decisions, if necessary-and to take\nresponsibility for those decisions.\nQUESTION\nWhy is it more dzficult today to reb on expertise and knowledge\nwhen exercisingjudgment that challenges accepted noms?\n\nREMEMBERING JIM MARTIN\nJOHN NEWCOMB held several positions on Viking from 1968 to 1977. In addition to being trajectory analysis and\ndesign manager during the phase covered in \xe2\x80\x9cEnd-to-End Commitment,\xe2\x80\x9d he also served as the Viking operations\nanalysis manager and Viking support office manager, and was deputy to Jim Martin for extended mission planning.\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim moved his people around,\xe2\x80\x9d remembers Newcomb. \xe2\x80\x9cHis project organization was a very fluid one.\xe2\x80\x9d If one area of\nthe project needed attention, Martin re-organized his leadership team, and put team members in the positions where he felt they were\nneededthe most. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen things stabilized,\xe2\x80\x9d Newcomb explains,\xe2\x80\x9dhe would often move people again. I went from highly technical assignments such as being responsible for the design of the orbiter and lander trajectories, to one in which I hadto coordinate the entire Viking\nteam to develop the flight operations protocol, to one where I was involved in negotiating contracts for the extended mission worth a\ntotal of $40 million. In that way, Viking was a very broadening experience for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs Viking project manager, Jim Martin led a 750-person team of NASA, industry and university engineers, scientists, and technicians.\nViking 1 and Viking& twin robot landers, launched in 1975 and touched down on Mars a year later, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s first successful missions to\nthe Red Planet.
