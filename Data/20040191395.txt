b'TMO Progress Report 42-141\n\nMay 15, 2000\n\nGround-to-Ground Optical Communications\nDemonstration\nA. Biswas1 and S. Lee1\n\nA bidirectional horizontal-path optical link was demonstrated between Strawberry Peak (SP), Lake Arrowhead, California, and the JPL Table Mountain Facility (TMF), Wrightwood, California, during June and November of 1998. The\n0.6-m telescope at TMF was used to broadcast a 4-beam 780-nm beacon to SP. The\nJPL-patented Optical Communications Demonstrator (OCD) at SP received the\nbeacon, performed \xef\xac\x81ne tracking to compensate for the atmosphere-induced beacon\nmotion and retransmitted a 844-nm communications laser beam modulated at 40 to\n500 Mb/s back to TMF. Characteristics of the horizontal-path atmospheric channel\nas well as performance of the optical communications link were evaluated. The\n2\nnormalized variance of the irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations or scintillation index \xcf\x83I at either\nend was determined. At TMF where a single 844-nm beam was received by a 0.6-m\n2\naperture, the measured \xcf\x83I covered a wide range from 0.07 to 1.08. A single 7802\nnm beam \xcf\x83I measured at SP using a 0.09-m aperture yielded values ranging from\n0.66 to 1.03, while a combination of four beams reduced the scintillation index due\nto incoherent averaging to 0.22 to 0.40. This reduction reduced the dynamic range\nof the \xef\xac\x82uctuations from 17 to 21 dB to 13 to 14 dB as compared with the OCD\ntracking sensor dynamic range of 10 dB. Predictions of these values also were made\nbased on existing theories and are compared. Generally speaking, the theoretical\nbounds were reasonable. Discussions on the probability density function (PDF)\nof the intensity \xef\xac\x82uctuations are presented and compared with the measurements\nmade. The lognormal PDF was found to agree for the weak scintillation regime as\nexpected. The present measurements support evidence presented by earlier measurements made using the same horizontal path, which suggests that the aperture\naveraging e\xef\xac\x80ect is better than theoretically predicted. The temporal power spectral densities (PSDs) of the irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations show nominal agreement with\ntheoretically predicted behavior. The focal-spot sizes of the 844-nm and 780-nm\nbeams received at either end are reported and compared with atmospheric \xe2\x80\x9cseeing\xe2\x80\x9d\npredicted by theory. The limit in which the theories agree with measurements is\ninconsistent with certain assumptions that are made; removing these assumptions\nrenders signi\xef\xac\x81cant di\xef\xac\x80erences between theory and measurement. The measured\npeak-to-peak beam wander at TMF was 4 m as compared with the theoretical prediction of 0.8 m. The received optical power at each end validates the uncertainty\n1 Communications\n\nSystems and Research Section.\n\nThe research described in this publication was carried out by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of\nTechnology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n1\n\npredicted by link analysis. The temporal beacon spot motion on the OCD focalplane array, a charge-coupled device (CCD), caused by atmosphere-induced phase\ntilt was used to determine the PSD. These PSDs were used together with the OCD\ntracking model to predict the uncompensated error and were found to be in agreement with measured values ranging from 4.8 to 9.3 \xc2\xb5rad. The beacon motion PSDs\nalso showed a partial correlation (0.67) with the intensity \xef\xac\x82uctuations sensed by the\nOCD focal-plane array. The best bit-error rates measured at TMF were 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x925\nand were limited mainly by beacon fades, though beam wander of the OCD beam\nalso may have played a role.\n\nI. Introduction\nOptical communications is being developed by the TMOD Technology Program in order to provide\ncost-e\xef\xac\x80ective service to an expanding set of future NASA missions. Optical communications technology\nis capable of higher data rates with lower-mass and -power \xef\xac\x82ight terminals as compared with current rf\ntechnology. Moreover, signi\xef\xac\x81cant bandwidth expansion in an unregulated portion of the electromagnetic\nspectrum may be utilized. The horizontal path demonstrations described in this article are conducted as\na precursor to space-to-ground laser communications demonstrations, the eventual goal being validation\nof optical communications technology for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s deep-space applications. Optical communications links\nfrom spacecraft in deep space to Earth-based ground receiving stations currently are planned because\nthe alternative approach of using orbiting large aperture receivers poses formidable technology and cost\nchallenges. Therefore, optical communications systems design requires a thorough understanding of atmospheric channel e\xef\xac\x80ects on propagating laser beams. Extensive theoretical work with limited experimental\nvalidation [1,2] of atmospheric e\xef\xac\x80ects on laser-beam propagation has been reported. We plan incremental\ndemonstrations using optical communication systems in order to test the extent of agreement with theory,\nthereby gaining the ability to design higher-performance systems.\nAs compared with horizontal-path links exceeding a 10-km range, space-to-ground links for satellite\nlaser communications involve beam propagation through a lower air mass. Consequently, the impact of\natmospheric turbulence e\xef\xac\x80ects is less severe than that encountered on horizontal links. On the other\nhand, space-to ground links usually involve dynamic tracking and pointing strategies in order to maintain\nline of sight and compensate for space platform vibrations and jitter. Ground to geostationary (GEO)\norbiting spacecraft are an exception wherein the line of sight also is static. Other di\xef\xac\x80erences also arise\nbecause both receiver and transmitter are \xe2\x80\x9cimmersed\xe2\x80\x9d in the atmosphere for horizontal links. This is\nequivalent to having a phase screen in front of both receiving and transmitting apertures instead of only\nthe ground-receiving aperture in space-to-ground links. Beam wander of the transmitted laser and focalspot distortions of the received beacon, which would be absent for a space-borne optical transceiver, are\npresent in horizontal optical links. These di\xef\xac\x80erences complicate a direct comparison between horizontal\nand space-to-ground links. With regard to atmospheric e\xef\xac\x80ects, horizontal links provide a worst case of\nspace-to-Earth links, especially when the spacecraft is near the horizon.\nNotwithstanding these important di\xef\xac\x80erences, we believe that horizontal-link demonstrations do provide\na cost-e\xef\xac\x80ective early systems evaluation of optical communications, particularly of the design aspects\nrelated to mitigating atmospheric e\xef\xac\x80ects. With this in mind, a horizontal-path (46-km) bidirectional\noptical link demonstration [3,4] was conducted in June and November of 1998. The link was established\nbetween Strawberry Peak (SP), Lake Arrowhead, California, and the JPL Table Mountain Facility (TMF)\nin Wrightwood, California. A 0.6-m-aperture telescope at TMF was used to broadcast a multibeam\ncontinuous wave (CW) beacon (780 nm) to Strawberry Peak. The Optical Communications Demonstrator\n(OCD) [5,6], a JPL-patented laboratory prototype terminal located at SP, was manually aligned to acquire\nthe beacon on its focal-plane array. The acquired beacon spot was subject to atmospheric turbulenceinduced intensity and position \xef\xac\x82uctuations. The OCD transmitted a communications laser beam back to\nTMF while using the \xef\xac\x81ne-steering control loop to compensate for atmosphere-induced beacon-spot motion.\n2\n\nThe communications laser (840-nm) signal was modulated by a nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) pseudorandom\nbit sequence (PRBS) at 40 to 500 Mb/s.\nThe demonstration objectives were to\n(1) Evaluate received-signal irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations\n(2) Measure and compare the focused spot sizes with those predicted by atmospheric seeing\nand angle-of-arrival \xef\xac\x82uctuation e\xef\xac\x80ects\n(3) Validate link-analysis uncertainties at either end\n(4) Evaluate the \xef\xac\x81ne-tracking performance of the OCD\n(5) Evaluate end-to-end link performance\nA summary of theoretical predictions related to the measurements made in this demonstration along\nwith a review of similar measurements made in previous demonstrations is given in Section II. The\noperational details along with a description of the setups used at either end of the link are described in\nSection III. Results, including comparisons with theoretical predictions, and discussions are in Section IV.\nSection V presents the conclusions and future plans.\n\nII. Theory\nOptical communications links must be designed to accommodate the myriad e\xef\xac\x80ects encountered during\nthe passage of a laser beam through the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s turbulent atmosphere, without su\xef\xac\x80ering outages. The\ndominant atmospheric e\xef\xac\x80ects are optical scintillation, angle-of-arrival \xef\xac\x82uctuations or phase tilt, beam\nwander, and beam spreading. Atmospheric attenuation of the laser beam due to absorption and scattering,\nwhich also results in loss of signal, is not discussed here. These e\xef\xac\x80ects will be addressed in a future article,\nutilizing data gathered from the Atmospheric Visibility Monitoring Stations [7].\nA. Atmospheric Effects [1,2]\nRandom thermal \xef\xac\x82uctuations and wind in the atmosphere give rise to refractive index variations\nperturbing the propagation of a laser beam. The atmospheric channel is comprised of \xe2\x80\x9catmospheric cells\xe2\x80\x9d\nor eddies of continuously varying size. The inner scale, l0 , and outer scale, L0 , set lower and upper\nbounds on these cell sizes. The L0 value represents the size below which turbulent energy is injected\ninto a region, while l0 is associated with the smallest cell size before energy is dissipated into heat.\nCoherent laser beams propagating through the random phase media (atmosphere) undergo di\xef\xac\x80ractive\nand refractive perturbations when interacting with the cells [8]. Qualitatively, cell sizes smaller than a\nbeam diameter cause di\xef\xac\x80ractive or interference e\xef\xac\x80ects, while those larger than a beam diameter cause\nrefractive or focusing e\xef\xac\x80ects. Atmospheric turbulence models describe the power spectrum of refractive\nindex \xef\xac\x82uctuations. Examples of these are the Kolmogorov and Von Karman spectra. A plane, spherical,\nor Gaussian optical wave front together with the choice of an atmospheric turbulence spectrum form the\nbasis of the theoretical formulation of beam-propagation theory.\n1. Optical Scintillation. Optical scintillation, a dominant observable e\xef\xac\x80ect, has a twofold e\xef\xac\x80ect:\n(1) temporal irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations sensed by a point detector receiving the laser beam after its passage\nthrough the atmosphere and (2) spatial intensity variations or speckle on a receiving aperture. Consider\nthe temporal irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations \xef\xac\x81rst. Irradiance measurements of a laser beam, which traverses an\n2\natmospheric path, can be used to determine the normalized variance or scintillation index, \xcf\x83I , given by\n2\n\xcf\x83I =\n\nI2\nI\n3\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\n(1)\n\nwhere I represents the measured irradiance and\ndenotes an ensemble average. This can be related\n2\nto a theoretically derived quantity known as the Rytov variance [Appendix, Eq. (A-1)], \xcf\x83R . The Rytov\nvariance describes irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations experienced by an unbounded plane wave as it propagates\n2\nthrough the atmosphere characterized by the Kolmogorov spectrum. As detailed in the Appendix, \xcf\x83R\n2\ncan be used to characterize the strength of turbulence for an optical link. Thus, \xcf\x83R < 1 corresponds\n2\n2\n1 denotes strong turbulence; and, \xef\xac\x81nally, \xcf\x83R \xe2\x86\x92 \xe2\x88\x9e represents\nto the weak \xef\xac\x82uctuation regime; \xcf\x83R\n2\n2\nsaturation. Exact analytical theories provide relations between \xcf\x83I and \xcf\x83R only in the weak \xef\xac\x82uctuation\n2\n2\nregime; however, asymptotic theories have been derived to extend the \xcf\x83I dependence on \xcf\x83R for diverse\natmospheric conditions. These relations are summarized in the Appendix [Eqs. (A-2) through (A-4)].\n2\nKnowledge of \xcf\x83I allows a determination of the dynamic range desired by the detector/sensor used to\nreceive the laser signal in an optical link. Passage through the random phase media causes random\n\xef\xac\x82uctuations of the laser-beam amplitude; however, what is measured is the intensity. The intensities\nin the weak regime obey a lognormal distribution. Several mathematically complicated theories for the\nprobability distribution function (PDF) universally applicable for weak-to-strong irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations\nhave been reported [9,10]. With knowledge of the PDF, a determination of the fade statistics can be\nmade, i.e., the probability of a fade exceeding a threshold dB level, the mean number of fades, and the\nmean duration of a fade [see Eq. (A-6)]. These quantities can be used to set bounds on the time-averaged\nbit-error and burst-error rates of an optical link. Finally, the temporal power spectral density (PSD)\nthat can be determined by monitoring the irradiance provides knowledge of the frequency content of the\nirradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations.\nThe second optical scintillation e\xef\xac\x80ect related to spatial intensity variations mentioned above is the\natmospheric seeing described as \xce\xbb/r0 , where \xce\xbb is the optical wavelength and r0 is called the Fried parameter or atmospheric coherence length. Equation (A-7) in the Appendix shows estimates of the spatial\ncoherence length, \xcf\x810 , from which r0 is obtained by the simple relation r0 = 2.1 \xc3\x97 \xcf\x810 . The seeing limits the e\xef\xac\x80ective focal-spot size to (2f \xce\xbb/r0 ) rather than the di\xef\xac\x80raction-limited (2f \xce\xbb/D), where D is the\nreceiving-aperture diameter. Typical r0 \xe2\x80\x99s of a few centimeters render the focal-spot size to many times\nlarger than the di\xef\xac\x80raction limit. The random intensity \xef\xac\x82uctuations observed at the focal plane cause \xe2\x80\x9chot\nspots\xe2\x80\x9d to appear randomly in di\xef\xac\x80erent spatial regions so that the e\xef\xac\x80ective centroid of the spot moves. A\nshort-exposure blur circle can be described to enclose all the energy.\n2. Angle-of-Arrival Fluctuations. Angle-of-arrival \xef\xac\x82uctuations (see Eq. (A-8) in the Appendix)\ndue to random atmosphere-induced tilts of the optical wave front at the receiving aperture cause the spot\nto undergo random motion, also called \xe2\x80\x9cimage dancing,\xe2\x80\x9d in the focal plane. The combined spot motion\nand seeing e\xef\xac\x80ects de\xef\xac\x81ne a long-exposure blur circle over which the optical energy is distributed. Optical\ndetectors must be large enough to e\xef\xac\x83ciently gather all the distributed optical energy in the blur circle.\nFor very high data rate communications, this need con\xef\xac\x82icts with low detector capacitance (surface area)\ndesired for high-bandwidth optical\xe2\x80\x93electrical conversion. For optical transceivers like the OCD, which\nrely on beacon tracking, the image dancing and seeing cause beacon centroid motion on the focal plane.\nThe \xef\xac\x81ne pointing of the transmitted laser beam can be corrected so that reciprocity will ensure the arrival\nof the laser to the location from which the beacon originated.\nThe size of the collection aperture (see Eq. (A-9) in the Appendix) used to collect the laser signal after\nits passage through the atmosphere a\xef\xac\x80ects the observed intensity \xef\xac\x82uctuations. The larger the aperture\nsize, the larger the number of speckles over which averaging occurs, with a net reduction of the intensity\n\xef\xac\x82uctuations sensed by a detector at the focal plane of the aperture.\n3. Beam Wander. Beam wander (see Eq. (A-10) of the Appendix), on the other hand, occurs due\nto the presence of atmosphere near the transmitter aperture. Beam diameters smaller than atmospheric\ncell sizes are e\xef\xac\x80ectively de\xef\xac\x82ected (refracted) by the varying refractive index eddies. Thus, when the\nbeam has spread to scales larger than the atmospheric outer scale before encountering the atmosphere,\nsuch as in satellite-to-Earth communications, the beam wander e\xef\xac\x80ects are absent. On the other hand,\nbeams originating from Earth telescopes, transmitted either to space or horizontally, usually have beam\n4\n\ndiameters smaller than the atmospheric cell sizes and are subject to beam wander. Beam wander may give\nrise to additional irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations for a Gaussian intensity-pro\xef\xac\x81le laser beam. This contribution is\neven more signi\xef\xac\x81cant when the beam footprint is of the order of the receiving aperture size.\n\n4. Beam Spreading. Beam spreading (see Eq. (A-11) in the Appendix) by the atmosphere spreads\nthe energy density in the beam and contributes to additional dB loss in the link. The e\xef\xac\x80ective beam\ndiameter can be thought of as a short-term beam diameter with random perturbations due to beam\nwander, so that the beam energy is spatially concentrated within a region of the e\xef\xac\x80ective beam diameter.\n\nB. Previous Demonstrations\nAlthough many horizontal-path optical-link experiments have appeared in the literature, we will discuss\na few that are relevant to the current demonstration. A unidirectional optical-link demonstration was\nconducted jointly by Thermotrex and JPL [11], wherein an 80- to 250-\xc2\xb5rad-divergence 810-nm laser beam\nwas transmitted from SP to TMF in 1994. The received beam footprint at TMF was used to evaluate\nthe e\xef\xac\x80ects of aperture averaging. Scintillation indices of 0.14 to 0.28 were measured for the largest\naperture (28.7-cm diameter) used. The Thermotrex group [12] established a 150-km horizontal-path\noptical link between Mt. Haleakala and Mauna Kea at Hawaii. They reported scintillation indices in the\nrange of 0.22 to 0.34. A group at the University of Central Florida [13] performed a reduced path length\n(183-m to 3-km) optical-link demonstration. They used the Cape Kennedy runway to measure scintillation\nindices well into the saturation regime of atmospheric turbulence and compared the measurements with\ntheoretical models. A group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratories [14]\ndemonstrated multibeam laser propagation using nine 488-nm beams over a 5.4-km range. A scintillation\nindex reduction from 0.4\xe2\x80\x931.5 for a single beam to 0.1\xe2\x80\x930.18 using nine beams was reported.\n\nGround-to-satellite optical links also have been demonstrated. Some of these links used an uplink\nlaser transmitted from the ground and re\xef\xac\x82ected back to the ground from retrore\xef\xac\x82ectors attached to low\n2\nEarth-orbiting (LEO) spacecraft. The measured normalized variance \xcf\x83I was representative of the uplink\nscintillation since the downlink contribution was negligible. The Low Power Atmospheric Compensation\n2\nExperiment (LACE) [15] satellite was used for retrore\xef\xac\x82ected links where \xcf\x83I values ranging between\n0.08 and 0.20 were measured. Furthermore, the temporal power spectral density showed a 30 times smaller\ncontribution at frequencies >100 Hz as compared with 1 Hz. The Relay Mirror Experiment (RME) [16]\nalso used retrore\xef\xac\x82ectors on a near-Earth orbiting satellite to establish optical links. Scintillation indices,\n2\n\xcf\x83I , ranging from 0.09 to 0.67 at frequencies ranging from 25 to 400 Hz were reported. The increase\nin higher-frequency contributions in the latter demonstration is noteworthy, although no space platform\njitter results were provided in either of the two retrore\xef\xac\x82ector space-to-ground links cited. Furthermore, in\n2\nthe RME, evidence was presented supporting the increase in \xcf\x83I with o\xef\xac\x80-axis pointing of the uplink beam\n(see Eq. (A-2) of the Appendix). A geostationary orbit laser communications demonstration (GOLD)\nwas reported jointly by JPL and Communications Research Laboratory of Japan [17,18]. The laser\ncommunications terminal aboard the Japanese ETS-VI satellite was used. Scintillation indices of 0.18 or\nbetter were measured. GOLD used a four-beam 514.5-nm multibeam uplink, demonstrating for the \xef\xac\x81rst\ntime the improvement in scintillation index that is achievable in ground-to-satellite links.\n\nIn the present demonstration, we are using a bidirectional link with laser beams being exchanged\nbetween a telescope and the optical communications terminal. This con\xef\xac\x81guration has not been reported\non previously. In addition to measuring the scintillation index at either end, we report on observed spot\nsizes (in order to evaluate seeing), link analysis, OCD \xef\xac\x81ne-tracking, and, \xef\xac\x81nally, a preliminary evaluation\nof end-to-end performance. Most of the horizontal-path demonstrations described above have been limited\nto scintillation-index measurements.\n5\n\nIII. Demonstration Description\nA. Operational Details\nFigure 1 shows the 46-km-link range with a sectional view of the intervening terrain. The bidirectional\noptical path shown is almost entirely 2-km above sea level, providing relatively favorable atmospheric\nturbulence as compared with a sea-level horizontal link. A sturdy tripod located at SP was used for\nmounting the OCD assembly. The OCD assembly included a gimbal mount that facilitated manual\ncontrol of OCD azimuth and elevation pointing; however, the gimbal was not electronically integrated\nand, therefore, could not be controlled by the OCD control-loop software.\n\n(AT LEAST FOUR TIMES THE AIR MASS FOR EQUIVALENT ZENITH PATH)\n\nSTRAWBERRY PEAK\nOCD 10-cm-aperture transmitter\nALTITUDE = 1875 m\nLATITUDE = 34 deg 13.92 min\nLONGITUDE = 117 deg 14.083 min\n\nTMF\n0.6-m TELESCOPE RECEIVER\nALTITUDE = 2272 m\nLATITUDE = 34 deg 22.9 min\nLONGITUDE = 117 deg 40.897 min\nRANGE = 46.48 km\n\nFig. 1. A sectional view of the intervening terrain between TMF and SP.\n\nThe optical link was initiated by transmitting a multibeam beacon from the 0.6-m-aperture telescope\nat TMF to SP. Pointing relied upon knowledge of the 0.6-m TMF telescope settings required for locating\nSP. A co-bore-sighted 0.15-m spotting telescope with an intensi\xef\xac\x81ed charge-coupled device (CCD) camera\nattachment capable of sensing a \xef\xac\x82ashlight or electric lamp source at SP was used to validate the TMF\ntelescope pointing. Use of the intensi\xef\xac\x81ed camera, however, was restricted to nighttime backgrounds. Once\nthe 0.6-m telescope was pointed to SP, a multibeam beacon (780 nm) comprised of four co-aligned beams\nwas broadcast from TMF to SP. The details of the optical train used to accomplish this are described\nbelow.\nFollowing beacon transmission, the OCD at SP was pointed to TMF by manual adjustments of the\ntripod and gimbal. The co-bore-sighted 0.15-m spotting telescope with an intensi\xef\xac\x81ed camera at TMF\nwas used to guide the OCD laser alignment. After the laser spot was sensed, manual adjustments of\nthe elevation and azimuth of the OCD gimbal were made in order to increase the brightness of the\nlaser spot on the intensi\xef\xac\x81ed camera monitor. This was continued until the power meter located near\nthe TMF coud\xc2\xb4 focus registered the OCD laser signal. The power received at TMF was maximized by\ne\nfurther manual adjustment of the OCD gimbal azimuth and elevation. Finally, the OCD \xef\xac\x81ne-steering\n\n6\n\nmirrors were electronically stepped to achieve \xef\xac\x81ne alignment with TMF. The latter step also resulted in\nacquisition and centering of the beacon spot in the OCD tracking sensor.\nOnce the static bidirectional link was established following the above procedure, several measurements\ncould be performed. Irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations of the individual beacon beams as well as the combination\nof all four beams were recorded with spotting telescopes [see Fig. 2(a)].\nThe CCD camera that served as the OCD tracking sensor recorded images (single frames) of the\nreceived-beacon spot size. These were used to assess the atmospheric seeing e\xef\xac\x80ects on the spot size. The\nPSDs of the beacon spot motion, sensed by the CCD, also were measured using open-loop acquisition.\nThese data sets, each containing 4000 centroid pairs (x- and y-axis at the focal plane) correspond to a\nduration of 2 s, since the 128-by-128 pixel CCD reads out subframes containing the regions of interest at\n2 kHz. The centroids were computed using a 10-by-10 pixel window, where the angular extent of each\npixel is 10 \xc2\xb5rad. PSDs were computed using fast Fourier transform (FFT) operation as follows:\n\nS(f ) = FFT x(t)\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x88\x86t2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \xe2\x88\x86t is the sampling interval, 500 \xc2\xb5s. Finally, the OCD control loop, using a two-axis \xef\xac\x81ne-steering\nmirror (FSM) and the CCD, was activated. A \xef\xac\x81xed o\xef\xac\x80set between the centroid positions of the received\nbeacon and a bore-sighted transmit laser on the CCD was maintained by the control loop, while transmitting the high data rate on\xe2\x80\x93o\xef\xac\x80 key modulated laser signal to TMF. Pseudo-random bit sequences (PRBS)\nrepresented by 2N \xe2\x88\x92 1 (with N = 7 and 23) were used to modulate the OCD laser at 40 to 500 Mb/s.\nWhile in closed-loop operation, the OCD recorded beacon and transmit laser centroids at 1-s intervals.\nAt TMF, power and irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuation measurements of the received communications laser signal\nwere recorded. In addition, pupil images and focal-plane spots of the received 840-nm beam were recorded.\nEye patterns and bit-error rate measurements also were performed on the communications laser signal.\nB. SP Setup\nFigure 2(a) shows a block diagram of the elements that comprised the SP setup. The OCD assembly\nmounted on a gimbal (not shown) had an optical interface with the laser transmitter and an electronic\ninterface to the PC. An 844-nm optical-\xef\xac\x81ber-pigtailed diode capable of high-speed (500-Mb/s) on\xe2\x80\x93o\xef\xac\x80 key\nmodulation provides \xe2\x88\xbc30 mW of average optical power to the OCD. Laser light emitted from the singlemode \xef\xac\x81ber is collimated and re\xef\xac\x82ected o\xef\xac\x80 the FSM before being transmitted from the 10-cm-aperture\ntelescope. A small bore-sighted fraction of the laser is focused on the CCD camera. Approximately\n17 mW of optical power exits the telescope. The PC shown in Fig. 2(a) houses a digital signal-processing\n(DSP) board. The DSP board reads out (2-kHz) subframe CCD images from which relative centroid\npositions of the received beacon and bore-sighted transmit spots are determined. Control signals to the\nFSM ampli\xef\xac\x81er are generated based on updated beacon positions. In Fig. 2(a), the spotting scopes (SS1\nand SS2) are auxiliary Maksutov\xe2\x80\x93Cassegrain telescopes with 90-mm clear apertures and a focal ratio of\nf/13.8. These telescopes were modi\xef\xac\x81ed to accommodate 4-by-4-mm photodiodes that measured intensity\n\xef\xac\x82uctuations of the beacon beam transmitted from TMF. A storage oscilloscope was used to record the\nphotodiode output while sampling at 1- to 2-kHz.\nC.

Layouts: (a) the SP arrangement (spotting telescopes SS1 and SS2 are placed on either side of the OCD and\nused for acquiring beacon scintillation data); (b) the TMF coude room optical panel; and (c) the coude room electronic\nlayout.\n\nThe multibeam beacon-transmit assembly used four thermoelectrically cooled (TEC) 780-nm diode\nlasers with a multimode \xef\xac\x81ber [62.5-\xc2\xb5m diameter; 0.25 numerical aperture (NA)] coupled to the output.\nThe power emitted at the \xef\xac\x81ber end was approximately 20 mW for each of these lasers. The output beams\nfrom each \xef\xac\x81ber were collimated and then guided with the aid of fold mirrors to a combining lens followed\nby a dichroic beam splitter (BS). The beams were brought to focus at the telescope coud\xc2\xb4 focus and\ne\nthen emerged from the TMF telescope primary mirror as four co-propagating 70- to 100-\xc2\xb5rad divergence\n8\n\nbeams. The beam divergence was determined by estimating relative spot sizes at the coud\xc2\xb4 focus and the\ne\nprimary mirrors. Based on a 1-mm uncertainty in the relative positions of the beams at the coud\xc2\xb4 focus,\ne\nthe extent of co-alignment of the four beams was estimated to be 40 \xc2\xb5rad.\nAs shown in the optical train of Fig. 2(b), the received signal at TMF was transmitted through the\ndichroic beam splitter and recollimated by a lens. The collimated beam was split by a 70/30 beam splitter.\nThe re\xef\xac\x82ected (30 percent) portion of the beam was used to record pupil images and perform irradiance\n\xef\xac\x82uctuation measurements. Pupil images were acquired at video frame rates with varying exposure times\n(30, 20, 10, 5, and 1 ms) using a CCD camera and frame grabber. Irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations were measured\nusing a photodiode (4-by-4-mm square), sampled at 1 to 5 kHz by a digitizing oscilloscope. The collimated\nbeam fraction transmitted by the 70/30 beam splitter was guided and focused on an avalanche photodiode\n(APD) integrated with a transimpedance ampli\xef\xac\x81er. The APD active area was 500 \xc2\xb5m, with a bandwidth\nof 450 MHz and a voltage conversion gain of 170 kV/W. The APD maximum noise equivalent power\n(NEP) is 0.6 nW (\xe2\x88\x9261 dBm) at 450 MHz. The APD output is fed to a limiting ampli\xef\xac\x81er requiring a\nminimum 15-mV peak-to-peak signal. The limiting ampli\xef\xac\x81er output is fed to a clock and data-recovery\ncircuit. A \xef\xac\x82ip mirror was used near the APD to periodically record the focal spot received at TMF on\na CCD camera. A power meter near the coud\xc2\xb4 focus was used for measuring power. A retrore\xef\xac\x82ector\ne\nwas used to redirect the beacon laser spots into the receive assembly in order to check receive\xe2\x80\x93transmit\nco-alignment.\nThe electronic interface block diagram [Fig. 2(c)] shows the data acquisition and recording arrangement. The CCD camera output was connected to a frame-grabber card in the PC. The APD output\nwas fed to a clock and data-recovery (CDR) assembly. The resulting CDR outputs were used for viewing\neye patterns on a 12-GHz bandwidth oscilloscope or, alternatively, for performing bit-error rate (BER)\nmeasurements. The bit-error rate tester (BERT), digital oscilloscopes, and power meter are interfaced\nover a general purpose interface bus (GPIB) and allow storage of data on the PC hard drive.\nFigure 3 shows a collage of photographs relevant to the demonstration: Fig. 3(a) is the 0.6-m telescope\ndome at TMF; Fig. 3(b) shows TMF as seen from SP; Fig. 3(c) shows the coud\xc2\xb4 room optical assembly\ne\nused to receive and perform diagnostics on the communications laser signal; and, \xef\xac\x81nally, Fig. 3(d) shows\nthe OCD mounted on the tripod at SP. One of the two spotting telescopes (SS1) also is shown in Fig. 3(d).\n\nIV. Results and Discussions\nA. Atmospheric Scintillation Predictions and Measurements\n2\nEquation (A-1) was used to calculate theoretical \xcf\x83R values for the optical link. The atmospheric\n2\nstructure parameter, Cn , was estimated using the Air Force Geophysical Laboratories (AFGL) CLEAR I\n2\nNight model [6]. For elevations of interest, from 1.8 to 2.3 km (see Fig. 1), the predicted Cn range is\n\xe2\x88\x9216\n\xe2\x88\x9217\n\xe2\x88\x922/3\n2\n2\nto 5.2 \xc3\x97 10\nm\n. Using this range of Cn , theoretical bounds on \xcf\x83R for the beacon\nfrom 1 \xc3\x97 10\nand OCD laser beams were calculated as shown in Table 1. In the Appendix, Eqs. (A-2) through (A-4)\n2\n2\npresent a number of possible relations between \xcf\x83I and \xcf\x83R ; all of these also were calculated in Table 1.\nEquation (A-2) extends the weak \xef\xac\x82uctuation theory to include the case of a Gaussian wave-front beam.\n2\nThis relation also predicts a spatial dependence of \xcf\x83I \xe2\x80\x94in other words, an increase in scintillation index\n2\nwith mispointing. However, this relation is strictly valid for \xcf\x83R < 1. Equations (A-3) and (A-4) are valid\n2\n[8] for 0 < \xcf\x83R < \xe2\x88\x9e, with Eqs. (A-3a) and (A-3b) representing plane and spherical wave fronts when inner\nscale e\xef\xac\x80ects are neglected and Eqs. (A-4a) and (A-4b) representing plane and spherical wave fronts with\nnonzero inner scale e\xef\xac\x80ects. An atmospheric inner scale, l0 = 10 mm, was used in Eq. (A-4). Figure 4\n2\n2\npresents graphs of the predicted relation between \xcf\x83I and \xcf\x83R for parameters relevant to our optical link.\nWhen atmospheric cells of the order l0 do not contribute to scintillation, both plane and spherical wave\n2\n[Eqs. (A-3a) and (A-3b)] \xcf\x83I reach maxima close to 1.2\xe2\x80\x931.4. Including inner-scale e\xef\xac\x80ects and assuming\n2\n2\nl0 = 10 mm, on the other hand, predicts a continued increase in \xcf\x83I as a function of \xcf\x83R over the range\n2\nshown. As l0 decreases, the increase in \xcf\x83I predicted by Eqs. (A-4a) and (A-4b) becomes less steep (not\n\n9\n\n10\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\nOCD\n\nSS1\n\nFig. 3.

From Table 1, one can see that the theoretical bounds on \xcf\x83I are approximately from 0.97 to 1.9\nfor the SP-to-TMF beam (844 nm) and from 0.89 to 3.07 for the TMF-to-SP laser single beams (780 nm).\n2\nHowever, if the \xcf\x83I derived from the Gaussian approximation of weak \xef\xac\x82uctuation theory [Eq. (A-2)] is\nneglected, then these ranges change to from 0.83 to 1.38 and from 0.89 to 1.47.\n\nTable 2 shows the normalized variance measurements made at TMF (SP-to-TMF beam) during June\nand November 1998. The November data were sampled at 5 kHz and gathered for 4-s intervals, while the\n2\nJune data were sampled at 1 kHz and acquired for 50 s. \xcf\x83I is observed to range from 0.07 to 1.08. However,\nprior to comparing this with theory, the aperture-averaging factor discussed below must be accounted\nfor. The data were \xef\xac\x81tted to a lognormal distribution using a polynomial method [17]. Representative\nirradiance distributions along with the \xef\xac\x81t are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). The lognormal distribution\n2\n2\nthat \xef\xac\x81ts the data approaches an exponential for large \xcf\x83I and a Gaussian for small \xcf\x83I . However, Figs. 5(a)\nand 5(b) represent two extreme realizations of irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations. (Fig. 5(c) is discussed below.)\nAn overall assessment of the extent of \xef\xac\x81t observed is performed by comparing higher-order moments\nI n / I n (n being an integer) with those predicted by lognormal theory for many realizations. For the\nTMF measurements, this is shown in Fig. 6(a) for n = 3, 4, and 5 (Fig. 6(b) is discussed below). The\nsolid lines are derived from theory [1] by substituting\n11\n\nTable 2.

Figure 6(a) shows that beyond \xcf\x83I = 0.6, the deviation from lognormal behavior is\napparent for n = 4 and n = 5. This observation agrees well with similar horizontal-path data gathered\n2\nover shorter ranges (from 183 m to 3 km) at sea level, where Cn was in the range of 10\xe2\x88\x9214 m\xe2\x88\x922/3 [13]. It\n2\n2\nis noteworthy that \xcf\x83I = 0.6 also corresponds to \xcf\x83R = 1 for the plane-wave relation given by Eq. (A-3a)\n(plane wave with no inner scale e\xef\xac\x80ects) and shown in Fig. 4. As expected, the deviation from lognormal\nstatistics occurs as the weak \xef\xac\x82uctuation regime of scintillation is exceeded. A few exceptions to this\n2\ngeneral observation are also evident in the data, suggesting that sometimes \xcf\x83I > 1 can also show good\n\xef\xac\x81ts to lognormal statistics.\n2\nA wide range of \xcf\x83I (0.07\xe2\x80\x931.08) was observed, as shown in Table 2. Whether this spread is entirely\ndue to changes in the atmosphere or is modi\xef\xac\x81ed by some artifact of the measurement technique is not\n2\ncertain. On both June 18 and November 13, large changes in \xcf\x83I are apparent in measurements made a\nfew minutes apart. These variations do not correlate with wind-speed changes that also were recorded at\n2\nTMF. Further discussion on the variation of \xcf\x83I observed at TMF is carried out below.\n\nEquation (A-9) of the Appendix shows a number of relations for predicting the aperture-averaging\nfactor, A.

For the current measurements, the average theoretical \xcf\x83R of\n2\n2\nTable 1 was used to infer the \xcf\x83I corresponding to D = 0. The \xcf\x83I measurements in 1998 span a large\nrange but appear consistent with previous measurements and together suggest an aperture-averaging\nfactor better than theory predicts.\n\nAfter correction for the best theoretical aperture-averaging factor of 0.18 [Eq. (A-9b)], the theoretically\n2\ndetermined \xcf\x83I values of 0.97 to 1.38 in Table 1 will decrease to 0.16 to 0.56. However, an apertureaveraging factor of 0.08, as suggested by an imaginary line passing through the experimental points, will\n2\nresult in predicted \xcf\x83I that range approximately from 0.08 to 0.11. The measured values range from 0.07\nto 1.08. The lower range of measured values can be explained by invoking aperture averaging. Later in\n2\nthe text, beam wander is cited as a possible explanation for the higher range of \xcf\x83I values measured.\n\n14\n\nAPERTURE AVERAGING FACTOR A\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\nTHEORY 1\nTHEORY 2\nTHEORY 3\n\n0.01\n\nEXPT1994\nTMF1998\nSP1998\n0.001\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nFRESNEL NUMBER ((kD 2) / (4L ))0.5\nFig. 7. A comparison of alternate theories of\naperture averaging and measurements for optical links made between SP and TMF. The dark\ncircles representing measurements made with\nvarying aperture diameters were made in 1994,\nand the clear circles and dark squares were\nfixed-aperture measurements made in June and\nNovember 1998. The measurements provide\nstrong evidence that theory underpredicts the\nreduction in the scintillation index.\n\nTable 3 shows measurements made on four individual 780-nm beacon laser beams transmitted from\nTMF and received at SP. The normalized variances shown for the single beams (designated B1 through\nB4 and measured through spotting telescope SS1 or SS2) are all for June 18, 1998, between 10:00 and\n11:00 P.M. These are fairly representative of a larger set of measurements made on di\xef\xac\x80erent days in\nJune (not shown). However, the measurements shown represent the most reliable beacon scintillation\nmeasurements. Measurements made on all four beams combined (B1234SS1 and B1234SS2 ) also are\npresented in Table 3. Representative irradiance distributions along with lognormal \xef\xac\x81ts are shown in\nFig. 5(c). At least one of the single-beam PDFs, although shown \xef\xac\x81tted to a lognormal distribution,\nprobably would \xef\xac\x81t a negative exponential better. The PDF of the multibeam beacon also is approximated\nby a lognormal distribution, and the \xef\xac\x81t appears to be good. Figure 6(b) shows the higher moments plotted\nfor the single (\xef\xac\x81lled symbols) and multiple (clear symbols) beam scintillation-index measurements. The\n2\n\xcf\x83I values are higher (>0.6) for the single beam and lower (\xe2\x89\xa40.5) for the multiple beams.\nThe spatially separated measurements of the beacon intensity at SP suggested that all four beams\nwere not perfectly overlapped at SP. It is noteworthy that the combination of the beacon beams, even\n2\nthough determined to be imperfectly overlapping in the far \xef\xac\x81eld, provided a signi\xef\xac\x81cant reduction in \xcf\x83I .\n2\nThe predicted \xcf\x83I for the combination of four beams determined by using Eq. (A-5) from the Appendix\nis 0.35 and 0.18 for the SS2 and SS1, respectively, as compared with the measured 0.34 and 0.22. The\ndynamic range of the irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations reduced from a range of 17 to 21 dB for single beams to a\nrange of 13 to 14 dB for the combination. The larger deviation between measured and calculated values\nfor SS1 is attributed to saturation of the photodetector at the peak irradiances observed in the individual\nbeam measurements.\nThe beacon scintillation data with aperture averaging are shown in Fig. 7 (open circles). These data\nagain reinforce evidence of the aperture-averaging factor being better than predicted by theory, falling\n2\nalong an imaginary curve intersecting the 1994 measurements and low \xcf\x83I measurements made at TMF\nduring the current demonstration.\n15\n\nTable 3.

Theory predicts a more or less \xef\xac\x82at power dependence on frequency until\nit exceeds the quantity V (L \xc3\x97 \xce\xbb)\xe2\x88\x921/2 , following which it drops with a f \xe2\x88\x928/3 dependence, V being the\ncross-wind velocity, L the range, and \xce\xbb the wavelength. In the plots of Fig. 8, the power starts decreasing\naround 10 Hz, corresponding to a V of from 5 to 6 m/s. This value appears a little higher than the\ntypical observed average wind speeds of from 1 to 3 m/s; however, wind gusts as high as 12 to 14 m/s\nalso occurred. The slopes for the four plots shown are \xe2\x88\x922.5, \xe2\x88\x923.3, \xe2\x88\x922.3, and \xe2\x88\x921.5, as compared with the\ntheoretical value of \xe2\x88\x922.66.\nThe beam wander of the laser transmitted by OCD was measured during open-loop operation after the\nlink had been established. The beam footprint was projected on the telescope building wall by stepping\nthe FSM on the OCD. Peak-to-peak beam wander was observed to be approximately 4 m, as compared\nwith the predicted [Eq. (A-10)] maximum peak-to-peak value of 0.8 m. The beam-wander time period\nwas of the order of 1 to 2 s. The beam shape projected on the TMF telescope wall was more elliptical\nthan circular, with the minor axis being oriented vertically with respect to the ground. The measured\nbeam-spot size (major axis times minor axis) was 1.67 \xc3\x97 0.9 m, as compared with the 1.2 m expected\nfrom beam-spreading theory [Eq. (A-11)].\nThe 844-nm beam footprint at TMF is only 1 to 2 times the primary mirror size. Pupil images\nviewed on the CCD camera in the coud\xc2\xb4 room show intermittent display of the pupil image, suggesting\ne\nthat the beam footprint overshoots the primary mirror periodically. When \xef\xac\x81ne tracking of the OCD\nis turned on, the intermittence reduces signi\xef\xac\x81cantly but does not go away. The intermittence of the\npupil image observed at video rates occurred due to beam wander as well as to fades. Beam wander\nwould contribute to additional irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations that could degrade the scintillation index. A distinguishing factor between beam wander and scintillation-related fades is the time scale. So, if beam\nwander were contributing to irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations, a larger low-frequency component would appear in\nthe temporal spectrum. For comparison, the 780-nm beam footprint at SP is 3 to 4 m with respect to a\ncollection aperture of 0.09 to 0.1 m. The beam footprint being many times the aperture size signi\xef\xac\x81cantly\nreduces the contribution of beam-wander-related fades at SP. Therefore, comparing the temporal spectra\nat TMF and SP should show a larger low-frequency component at TMF as compared with SP. This\nis true of the spectra shown in Fig. 8, where the normalized peaks below 10 Hz are from 0.8 to 1 for\n\n16\n\n1\n\nINTENSITY PSD, (optical power)2/Hz\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n\nTMF\nSP\n\n0.00001\n\n0.000001\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nFREQUENCY, Hz\nFig. 8. Representative plots of the temporal PSDs determined using the intensity-fluctuation data recorded at TMF\nand SP.\n\nTMF, as compared with from 0.4 to 0.6 for SP. This observation supports the conjecture that beam\n2\nwander contributed to the observed larger values of \xcf\x83I recorded at TMF but does not provide conclusive\n2\nevidence. The very low \xcf\x83I observations (0.07) at TMF would further suggest that the beam wander did\nnot a\xef\xac\x80ect the irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations all of the time. Atmospheric variations could at times make the beam\nwander more dominant\xe2\x80\x94for example, when there are wind gusts anywhere along the path\xe2\x80\x94consequently\n2\ngiving rise to much larger \xcf\x83I .\nAtmospheric coherence length, r0 , predictions for the OCD beam received at TMF can be made\nassuming a Gaussian or plane wave for the limits where \xcf\x810 is much smaller or much larger than the\natmospheric inner scale, l0 [see Eq. (A-7)]. All these approximations yield r0 values ranging from 3.0\nto 10 cm (a 1-mm atmospheric inner scale was assumed) with corresponding atmospheric seeing from 1.7\nto 5.6 arcsec. The corresponding largest predicted focused spot sizes are 190 \xc2\xb5m. In addition to the\nseeing e\xef\xac\x80ects, the angle-of-arrival \xef\xac\x82uctuations cause motion of the focal spot. The predicted maximum\ndisplacement of the spot center should be contained inside a circle with a diameter of approximately\n100 \xc2\xb5m at the TMF focal spot CCD. Thus, according to theory, the blur circle resulting from the\ncombination of seeing and phase tilt (angle-of-arrival) \xef\xac\x82uctuations should not exceed 300 \xc2\xb5m.\nSpot sizes were measured at the focal plane using a CCD camera. On June 18 and 19, 1998, exposure\ntimes of 33 ms were used, while on November 13, 1998, exposure times of 1 ms were used. The mean\nspot diameter with longer exposure times was approximately 212 \xc2\xb5m, while the shorter exposure yielded\nmean spot sizes of approximately 150 \xc2\xb5m. The centroid motion of the spots never exceeded a maximum\nof 62 \xc2\xb5m. Thus, the blur circle described by spot motion and seeing appeared to be contained at the\nvery worst within a circle of 300 \xc2\xb5m. The seeing estimate based on the measured values ranges from 4.3\nto 6.7 arcsec. For comparison, TMF nighttime seeing typically ranges from 2 to 3 arcsec at zenith [17].\nNote that the worst-case predictions of \xcf\x810 that are obtained by assuming the Cn2 value of 1\xc3\x9710\xe2\x88\x9216 m\xe2\x88\x922/3\nand using a plane-wave approximation in the limit \xcf\x810\nl0 appear to best \xef\xac\x81t the measurements made.\nHowever, this approximation yields a \xcf\x810 that is larger than the assumed l0 of 1 mm. On the other hand,\nif l0 is assumed to be larger, then the spot sizes are under-predicted. This illustrates de\xef\xac\x81ciencies of the\ntheory in predicting measurements.\n17\n\nFor the focal recieved spot on the OCD, the seeing predicts a spot size of from 57 to 93 \xc2\xb5m, whereas\nthe spot observed on the CCD varied from 40 to 100 \xc2\xb5rad. This compares with from 20 to 30 \xc2\xb5rad\nmeasured in the laboratory. Thus, the phase front perturbation contributes in a two to three times larger\nfocal spot size.\nB. Link Analysis\nNominal, best-case, and worst-case predictions of the average power expected at either end of the\noptical link were obtained by analysis. A comparison between measurements and predictions provides an\nassessment of the link uncertainties.\nFigure 9(a) shows the comparison between optical power received through the two spotting scopes\nand the predictions for a single 70-\xc2\xb5rad divergence, 20-mW beam transmitted from TMF. The system\nloss consists of the transmit\xe2\x80\x93receive antenna gains, relay optics losses of the transmitting and receiving\n20\n\n(a)\n\n10\n\nSYSTEM\nLOSS\n\nNOMINAL PREDICTED VALUE\nBEST-CASE PREDICTION\nWORST-CASE PREDICTION\nSS1\nSS2\n\n0\n\ndBm\n\n-10\n\nATMOSPHERIC\nTRANSMISSION LOSS\n\n-20\n\nMISPOINTING LOSS\n\n-30\n-40\n-50\n-60\n15\n10\n\n(b)\n\nSYSTEM\nLOSS\n\nNOMINAL PREDICTED\nVALUE\nBEST-CASE PREDICTION\nWORST-CASE\nPREDICTION\nMEASURED POWER\n\n5\n0\n\ndBm\n\n-5\n-10\n\nATMOSPHERIC\nTRANSMISSION\nLOSS\nBEAM-SPREAD\nLOSS\n\nMISPOINTING\nLOSS\n\n-15\n-20\n-25\n-30\n-35\nFig. 9. Results of the link analysis as compared with measurements for (a) a single 100-mrad, 20-mW, 780-nm laser transmitted\nthrough a subaperture of the TMF telescope and received through\nthe spotting scopes at SP and (b) the 22-mrad, 17-mW, 840-nm laser\ntransmitted from OCD and received at the coude focus of the TMF\ntelescope.\n\n18\n\ntelescope assemblies (the latter was veri\xef\xac\x81ed in the laboratory while the former is based on speci\xef\xac\x81ed\nre\xef\xac\x82ectivity and expected performance degradation of the TMF telescope mirrors), and the space loss.\nThe atmospheric losses are based on FOCAS [19] predictions for varying visibility conditions, while the\npointing losses account for reasonable mispointing limits of the TMF telescope. The measurements agree\nwell with nominal predictions. In general, power through SS2 [see Fig. 2(b)] measured approximately\n5 dB more than SS1. This observation is consistent with the peak-intensity region of the beacon beam\nfootprint being close to the OCD optical axis and SS1 being approximately 2 m away from this peak.\nFigure 9(b) shows a comparison of the 840-nm optical power received at the coud\xc2\xb4 focus of the TMF\ne\ntelescope, with predictions. The system loss, atmospheric transmission loss, and pointing losses were\nobtained in a manner identical to that stated above. A beam-spread loss term is included since the e\xef\xac\x80ect\nof the atmosphere on the low-divergence, near-di\xef\xac\x80raction-limited beam exiting the OCD is non-negligible.\nNighttime observations of the beam footprint received at TMF through an IR viewer supported these\npredictions. In general, the measured powers are lower than the nominal predictions. The largest source\nof uncertainty in this analysis is the TMF telescope throughput e\xef\xac\x83ciency at 840 nm.\nC. OCD Acquisition and Fine-Tracking Performance\nThe beacon-spot sizes observed on the OCD tracking sensor were described in Section IV.A. The motion\nof the spot on the CCD is best described by a determination of the PSDs. Ten data sets were acquired\nthroughout the night of November 13, 1998. FFT operations described by Eq. (2) were performed. Table 4\nshows the root-mean-square (rms) motion determined for each of the data sets. Two PSD plots, which\nrepresent the largest and smallest observed rms beacon motions, are shown in Fig. 10 (data sets 1 and 4\nin Table 4). The PSDs of all the other data sets in Table 4 lie between these two cases. For comparison,\nthe Olympus spacecraft vibration PSD [20] model (dotted lines) also is shown in Fig. 10. The mean\nrms value observed for the OCD beacon-spot motion (approximately 10 \xc2\xb5rad for the x- and y-axes, or a\nroot sum square (rss) of approximately 14 \xc2\xb5rad radial) is slightly smaller than the Olympus spacecraft\nvibration, which has an rms value of 16 \xc2\xb5rad radial. Beacon motion caused by atmospheric turbulence in\nour demonstration is referenced to spacecraft vibrations by this comparison, since the Olympus spacecraft\nvibration model often is used to validate \xef\xac\x81ne-tracking performance for optical communication terminals.\n\nTable 4.

The PSD representing the observed beacon spot motion\non the OCD tracking sensor for the (a) largest and (b) smallest\nobserved rms centroid displacement. The Olympus spacecraft\nPSD is included for reference.\n\nBeacon motion was observed to decrease rapidly at higher frequencies. This was con\xef\xac\x81rmed by the data\nin Table 5, where the cumulative sum at a few frequencies (\xc2\xb5rad2 ) is shown. For example, over 90 percent\nof beacon motion occurs at less than 50 Hz for x-axis beacon motion. The contribution beyond 100 Hz\nis negligible.\n1. OCD Fine-Tracking Performance. The primary function of the OCD \xef\xac\x81ne-tracking control\nloop is to track the beacon position using the CCD and feed this information back to the FSM such that\nit can update the transmit laser \xef\xac\x81ne pointing to preserve a \xef\xac\x81xed o\xef\xac\x80set between beacon and bore-sight\ncentroids. This results in the transmit laser being pointed back to the direction from which the beacon arrived. The important performance parameter for the \xef\xac\x81ne-tracking control loop is the disturbance\nrejection bandwidth that is de\xef\xac\x81ned as a 0-dB bandwidth for disturbance rejection. For the tracking to\nbe e\xef\xac\x80ective, the disturbance rejection bandwidth should be su\xef\xac\x83ciently large to compensate the beacon\nmotion. In the current demonstration, this motion is caused by the atmospheric turbulence; however,\nin a space-borne optical communications terminal, this will be caused by platform vibration and jitter.\n\n20\n\nTable 5.

As is clear from the \xef\xac\x81gure, a 0-dB bandwidth is about 50 Hz for the x-axis and 60 Hz for the\ny-axis. Therefore, vibrations above 60 Hz will not be compensated and will even be ampli\xef\xac\x81ed in a certain\nfrequency range up to several hundred hertz.\nThe uncompensated beacon motion can be computed following [22]\n\n\xce\xb8rms =\n\nS(f ) |R(f )|2 df\n\n(4)\n\nwhere S(f ) is the angular beacon-motion power spectral density and R(f ) is the tracking-control-loop\nrejection in the frequency domain. Equation (4) was applied to the computed beacon-motion PSDs, and\nthe results are shown in Table 4 in the uncompensated motion columns. The average uncompensated\nbeacon motion is about 5 \xc2\xb5rad for both the x- and y-axis, which is approximately half the total rms\nmotion of 10 \xc2\xb5rad. Note that the estimates in Table 1 also include the centroid error of about 1 \xc2\xb5rad due\nto CCD electronic noise and algorithm error [4]. Use of the OLYMPUS spacecraft vibration model with\nEq. (4) resulted in an uncompensated motion of 3 \xc2\xb5rad as compared with 16 \xc2\xb5rad of rms motion. This\nis because beacon motion is relatively larger at higher frequencies, making compensation more di\xef\xac\x83cult.\nFigure 10 shows this to be true above 10 Hz.\nUncompensated motion could be determined from the centroid pairs logged by the OCD PC during\n\xef\xac\x81ne tracking. The centroid pairs are updated at 1 Hz so that power spectral densities of these data cannot\nbe directly compared. When \xef\xac\x81ne tracking was performed, closed-loop operation could be maintained for\nas long as 1000 s. The main cause of loss of track was due to beacon fades. This was consistent with\nthe laboratory-determined OCD CCD dynamic range of 10.5 dB, as compared with the 13- to 14-dB dynamic range of the intensity \xef\xac\x82uctuations. Comparisons of the relative beacon and transmit spot centroid\npairs was made for times when tracking worked without any fades. The sum of the beacon and transmit\nspot excursions should add up to zero for perfect compensation. The actual distribution of this sum was\n\n21\n\nVIBRATION SUPPRESSION, mrad/mrad\n\n101\n\n100\n10-1\n\n10-2\nX-AXIS\nY-AXIS\n\n10-3\n10-4\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\nFREQUENCY, Hz\nFig. 11.

The extent of agreement\nobserved between the predicted OCD loop performance and that indirectly measured is good.\n2. Power Spectral Density of Beacon Intensity Fluctuations. The \xef\xac\x82uctuations in beacon\nintensity directly a\xef\xac\x80ect the beacon centroid uncertainty [23]. Basically, centroid error is proportional\nto the inverse square root of beacon intensity, which implies some correlation between beacon intensity \xef\xac\x82uctuation and motion. The resulting centroid error will appear as beacon motion if not carefully\ndistinguished.\nFigure 12 shows two instances of PSDs of x-axis beacon motion along with corresponding intensity\n\xef\xac\x82uctuations sensed by the CCD. Although not perfectly correlated, these PSDs do show a 0.67 correlation,\nwhich supports the direct relationship between intensity \xef\xac\x82uctuations and beacon motions. The intensity\n\xef\xac\x82uctuations sensed by the CCD sensor shown in Fig. 12 are subject to the dynamic-range limitations\nmentioned above. The actual temporal \xef\xac\x82uctuations are better represented by the spectra shown in\nFig. 8.\n\nTable 6.

End-to-End Link Performance\n2\nIn Section IV.A, it was shown that, for the multibeam beacon, the \xcf\x83I was reduced as compared with\n2\na single beam, and that the irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations yielded a lognormal PDF.

As reported\nin Section IV.A, the received spot size was approximately 200 \xc2\xb5m, which was well contained within the\n500-\xc2\xb5m active area of the APD used. The APD output after clock and data recovery was used to\nrecord the BER. The recorded BERs at TMF are shown in Fig. 13 for 40- and 400-Mb/s data streams.\nThe recorded BERs are updated every second and display a \xef\xac\x82uctuation between two levels bounded by\n\xe2\x88\xbc1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x922 and \xe2\x88\xbc5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x924 .\nThe output of the APD detector also was used for viewing eye patterns. The eye-pattern screen of\nthe oscilloscope was recorded on a video tape and played back later for evaluation. Figure 14 displays\nindividual frames extracted from this video record, showing examples of the best- and worst-case eye\npatterns while transmitting PRBS N = 7 at 325 Mb/s. Similar results (not shown) were obtained at data\nrates up to 500 Mb/s. Qualitatively, the clean eye pattern represented by Fig. 14(a) persisted for several\nseconds, with intermittent glitches that degraded the eye pattern to that displayed in Fig. 14(b). Usually,\nwhen tracking was turned o\xef\xac\x80, the eye pattern degenerated to the appearance shown in Fig. 14(b).\n\nV. Conclusion\nPreliminary results obtained while performing a horizontal-path bidirectional optical-link demonstration were reported. Atmospheric scintillation e\xef\xac\x80ects were measured at either end of the link. The\ntheoretical bounds provide a basis for what to expect in terms of the scintillation index; however, the\nbounds span a wide range, as do the measurements, leaving a larger than desirable uncertainty. The\n2\nlower range of irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuation measurements, \xcf\x83I < 0.6, agreed well with a lognormal PDF. Some\ninconsistencies in theory were also pointed out with the seeing and beam-wander predictions.

Typical eye patterns recorded at TMF on June 19,\n1998: (a) best case and (b) worst case. Typically, best-case\neye patterns persisted for a few seconds, interrupted by the\nworst-case eye patterns. Without tracking, the worst-case\neye patterns were prevalent with occasional appearances of\nthe best case.\n\nmore measurements over extended day and night hours while monitoring meteorological conditions can\nprovide a better empirical assessment of atmospheric e\xef\xac\x80ects. Even though a lower scintillation index\nis expected for ground-to-space lower air-mass atmospheric paths, our demonstration showed values as\nlow as 0.07, which are as low or lower than reported for GEO and LEO space-to-ground demonstrations\ndiscussed in Section II.A.\nSome areas in which the ground-to-ground measurements provide useful systems-level evaluation for\noptical communications need to be emphasized. The characterization of the OCD \xef\xac\x81ne-tracking loop\nis one such system. Nominally, the observed uncompensated errors agreed with theory. However, the\ntracking was sampled only at 1 Hz, while the beacon characterization was not performed simultaneously.\nThis could be improved considerably. Firstly, beacon-irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations must fall within the tracking\nsensor dynamic range. This could potentially be achieved by using a larger number of beacon beams. As\nhas been shown, the four-beam beacon PDF \xef\xac\x81ts the lognormal distribution, and so fade statistics can be\npredicted and the tracking loop can be designed to tolerate a reasonable number and duration of fades.\nHaving the ability to log the beacon and transmit laser centroid positions in real time while performing\ntracking would then provide a self-consistent means of evaluating control-loop performance. The PSD of\natmospheric perturbations on beacon centroid motion has been shown to be comparable to the Olympus\njitter spectrum, so knowing the performance of the control loop for a horizontal link will provide insight\ninto expected \xef\xac\x82ight performance.\n25\n\nGiven the predicted beacon-fade statistics, the observed end-to-end link performance was as expected.\nHowever, this also masked possible contributions from beam wander that could have played a role in\nlimiting link performance. By implementing the improvements suggested above to properly characterize\n\xef\xac\x81ne tracking and then evaluating end-to-end performance, this issue should be clari\xef\xac\x81ed.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank M.

For a plane wave, \xcf\x83I = \xcf\x83R ; for a spherical wave, \xcf\x83I = 0.4\xcf\x83R .\nFor a Gaussian wave front, the following relation approximates the scintillation index:\n\n2\n2\n\xcf\x83I (r, L) \xe2\x88\xbc 4.42\xcf\x83R \xce\x9b5/6\n=\n\n\xef\xa3\xb1\n\xef\xa3\xb4\n\xef\xa3\xb2\n\n2\n\nr\n2\n+ 3.86\xcf\x83R\n\xef\xa3\xb4\nW2\n\xef\xa3\xb3\n\n0.4 (1 + 2\xce\x98)2 + 4\xce\x9b2\nx cos\n\n5\ntan\xe2\x88\x921\n6\n\n1 + 2\xce\x98\n2\xce\x9b\n\n5/12\n\n\xe2\x88\x92\n\n\xef\xa3\xbc\n\xef\xa3\xb4\n\xef\xa3\xbd\n\n11 5/6 \xef\xa3\xb4\n\xce\x9b \xef\xa3\xbe\n16\n\n(A-2)\n\nwhere the scintillation index is given as a function of r, the radial coordinate of a Gaussian pro\xef\xac\x81le; W\nrepresents the 1/e2 Gaussian beam width at the receiver; and \xce\x9b and \xce\x98 are Gaussian beam parameters\ndescribed as \xce\x9b = (2L/kW 2 ) and \xce\x98 = 1 + L/F , where F is the phase front radius of curvature. The above\nrelation suggests that the additive contribution from the \xef\xac\x81rst term for nonzero r (o\xef\xac\x80-axis pointing) will\nincrease the scintillation index given by Eq. (A-1).\n2\nThese derivations are valid for weak \xef\xac\x82uctuations restricted to \xcf\x83R < 1. Weak turbulence represents\nsingle scattering events with passage of the light wave through the atmosphere. However, with an increase\nin the path length or strength of atmospheric turbulence, multiple scattering events must be accounted for,\n2\n1. However, with continued multiple scattering,\ngiving rise to strong turbulence characterized by \xcf\x83R\nthe beam becomes increasingly less coherent, eventually appearing like extended multiple sources with\n2\nthe onset of saturation, characterized by \xcf\x83R \xe2\x86\x92 \xe2\x88\x9e. Recently, a heuristic model [7] has been proposed\n2\nfor 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 \xcf\x83R < \xe2\x88\x9e. Before presenting the expressions derived from this theory, certain parameters are\nintroduced, namely the atmospheric spatial coherence length, \xcf\x810 ; the Fresnel zone size, (L/k)1/2 ; and a\nscattering disk or \xef\xac\x81rst Fresnel zone, L/k\xcf\x810. In the proposed theory, optical scintillation is modeled as\na modulation process in which the small-scale (di\xef\xac\x80ractive) \xef\xac\x82uctuations are multiplicatively modulated\nby large-scale (refractive) \xef\xac\x82uctuations. Moreover, these processes are random and independent. Thus,\nsmall-scale contributions are associated with atmospheric cell sizes smaller than the Fresnel zone or the\ncoherence radius, whichever is smaller, and large scale \xef\xac\x82uctuations are caused by cell sizes larger than\nthe scattering disk. The following expressions were derived:\n\n2\n\xcf\x83I = exp\n\n2\n0.54\xcf\x83R\n2\n1 + 1.22(\xcf\x83R )6/5\n\n7/6\n\n+\n\n7/6\n\n+\n\n2\n0.509\xcf\x83R\n2\n1 + 0.69(\xcf\x83R )6/5\n\n5/6\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\n(A-3a)\n\nfor a plane wave and\n\n2\n\xcf\x83I = exp\n\n2\n0.17\xcf\x83R\n2\n1 + 0.167(\xcf\x83R )6/5\n\n28\n\n2\n0.225\xcf\x83R\n2\n1 + 0.259(\xcf\x83R )6/5\n\n5/6\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\n(A-3b)\n\nfor a spherical wave while neglecting inner scale e\xef\xac\x80ects.\nWith nonzero inner scale e\xef\xac\x80ects,\n2\n0.509\xcf\x83R\n\n2\n2\n\xcf\x83I = exp \xcf\x83x,p (l0) +\n\n2\n1 + 0.69(\xcf\x83R )6/5\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\n5/6\n\n(A-4a)\n\nfor a plane wave and\n2\n0.225\xcf\x83R\n\n2\n2\n\xcf\x83I = exp \xcf\x83ln x,s (l0) +\n\n2\n1 + 0.259(\xcf\x83R )6/5\n\n5/6\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\n(A-4b)\n\nfor a spherical wave, where\n\xce\xb7x,p Ql\n\xce\xb7x,p + Ql\n\n7/6\n\n2\n2\n\xcf\x83ln x,p (l0) = 0.15\xcf\x83R\n\n\xce\xb7x,s Ql\n\xce\xb7x,s + Ql\n\n7/6\n\n2\n2\n\xcf\x83ln x,s (l0) = 0.015\xcf\x83R\n\n\xce\xb7x,p\n\xce\xb7x,p + Ql\n\nx 1 + 7.53\n\n1/2\n\n\xce\xb7x,p\n\xce\xb7x,p + Ql\n\n\xe2\x88\x92 0.252\n\n7/12\n\nand\n\nx 1 + 1.753\n\n1/6\n\n2\nwith Ql = 10.89L/kl02 , \xce\xb7x,p = 3/(1 + 0.50\xcf\x83R Ql\n\n\xce\xb7x,s\n\xce\xb7x,s + Ql\n\n1/2\n\n\xce\xb7x,s\n\xce\xb7x,s + Ql\n\n\xe2\x88\x92 0.252\n\n1/6\n\n2\n), and \xce\xb7x,s = 8/(1 + 0.069\xcf\x83R Ql\n\n7/12\n\n).\n\nA recognized technique to mitigate the e\xef\xac\x80ect of atmospheric-turbulence-induced \xef\xac\x82uctuations on the\nbeacon is to use multiple beams. The beams are mutually incoherent and traverse independent atmospheric paths before overlapping near the receiver aperture. The irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuation sensed by the\nreceiver is an incoherent average of the independent beam \xef\xac\x82uctuations. N beams with measured mean\nand standard deviation represented by \xc2\xb5i and \xcf\x83i will result in a combined normalized variance of\nN\n2\n\xcf\x83Navg\n\ni\n\n=\n\n2\n\xcf\x83i\n2\n\nN\n\n(A-5)\n\n\xcf\x83i\ni\n\nBased on knowledge of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations and\n2\nknowledge of the scintillation index, \xcf\x83I , the fade probability for an optical communications link can be\ndetermined. The probably of a miss below a speci\xef\xac\x81ed dB-fade threshold level is described by Eq. (A-6).\nThis is derived based on the lognormal PDF assumption. Mean fade durations and the frequency of fades\nalso can be determined:\n\xef\xa3\xae\n\n\xef\xa3\xae\n\n\xef\xa3\xb9\xef\xa3\xb9\n2\n\xcf\x83I\n\xe2\x88\x92 0.23 \xc3\x97 fadethreshold\n1\xef\xa3\xaf\n\xef\xa3\xaf\n\xef\xa3\xba\xef\xa3\xba\n2\n\xe2\x88\x9a\nPmiss (\xcf\x83I ) = \xef\xa3\xb01 + erf \xef\xa3\xb0 2\n\xef\xa3\xbb\xef\xa3\xbb\n2\n2\xcf\x83I\n\n29\n\n(A-6a)\n\nmeanfades = \xce\xbd0 exp \xe2\x88\x92\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\xcf\x83I \xe2\x88\x92 0.23 fadethreshold\n2\n2\xcf\x83I\n\n(A-6b)\n\nwhere\n\xe2\x88\x9e 2\n\xcf\x89 S(\xcf\x89)d\xcf\x89\n0\n\xe2\x88\x9e\nS(\xcf\x89)d\xcf\x89\n0\n\n1\n\xce\xbd0 =\n2\xcf\x80\n\n1/2\n\nwith \xcf\x89 being the angular frequency of the temporal irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations and S(\xcf\x89) being the PSD of\nthe temporal irradiance \xef\xac\x82uctuations.\nThe power spectral density of the intensity \xef\xac\x82uctuations also is of interest because it can be easily\nmeasured. Theoretically, it has been derived as the Fourier transform of the temporal covariance function. Complicated mathematical expressions have been presented to describe the power spectral density\nof temporal \xef\xac\x82uctuations; however, these are not shown here. The temporal power spectral density is signi\xef\xac\x81cant because, under the Taylor frozen atmosphere hypothesis, the temporal statistics can be converted\nto spatial statistics with knowledge of local wind speed.\nThe speckle or spatial variations in beam-energy distribution during atmospheric propagation are\ncharacterized by spatial coherence length. Asymptotic relations hold for both weak and strong \xef\xac\x82uctuations\nin the regimes \xcf\x810\nl0 and l0\n\xcf\x810\nL0.
