b'Force-Measuring Clamps\nClamping forces can be measured easily and quickly.\nDryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California\nForce-measuring clamps have been invented to facilitate and simplify the task\nof measuring the forces or pressures applied to clamped parts. There is a critical\nneed to measure clamping forces or\npressures in some applications \xe2\x80\x94 for example, while bonding sensors to substrates or while clamping any sensitive or\ndelicate parts. Many manufacturers of\nadhesives and sensors recommend\nclamping at specific pressures while\nbonding sensors or during adhesive\nbonding between parts in general.\nIn the absence of a force-measuring\nclamp, measurement of clamping force\ncan be cumbersome at best because of the\nneed for additional load sensors and loadindicating equipment. One prior method\nof measuring clamping force involved the\nuse of load washers or miniature load cells\nin combination with external power\nsources and load-indicating equipment.\nCalibrated spring clamps have also been\nused. Load washers and miniature load\ncells constitute additional clamped parts\nin load paths and can add to the destabilizing effects of loading mechanisms.\nSpring clamps can lose calibration quickly\nthrough weakening of the springs and are\nlimited to the maximum forces that the\nsprings can apply.\nThe basic principle of a force-measuring clamp can be implemented on a\nclamp of almost any size and can enable\nmeasurement of a force of almost any\nmagnitude. No external equipment is\n\nneeded because the component(s) for\ntransducing the clamping force and the\ncircuitry for supplying power, conditioning the output of the transducers, and displaying the measurement value are all\nhoused on the clamp. In other words, a\nforce-measuring clamp is a complete\nforce-application and force-measurement\nsystem all in one package. The advantage\nof unitary packaging of such a system is\nthat it becomes possible to apply the desired clamping force or pressure with precision and ease.\nLike many other load-measuring devices, a force-measuring clamp contains\nstrain gauges and exploits the well-known\nproportionality between strain and applied force or pressure. More specifically, a force-measuring clamp contains\nfour strain gauges electrically connected\nin a Wheatstone bridge. The bridge output is fed to zero and span circuitry, the\noutput of which is digitized and displayed. The span and zero circuitry\nmake it possible to calibrate the bridge\noutput to indicate force or pressure in\nany suitable unit of measure.\nThe strain gauges can be installed by\nuse of Measurements Group M-Bond 610\n(or equivalent) epoxy-phenolic adhesive\nor Measurements Group AE 10 (or equivalent) epoxy adhesive. The strain gauges\nare connected to a terminal strip for incorporation into the bridge by wires of 34\nAmerican Wire Gauge [\xe2\x89\x886.3 mils (\xe2\x89\x880.16\nmm) in diameter]. Wires of the same size\n\nare used for connections between the terminal and a printed-circuit board. The\nprinted-circuit board contains a voltageregulation circuit, the span and zero circuits, two watch batteries, and a power\nswitch. The final-stage output of the\nprinted circuit is fed to a digital-display device that is plugged into the printed-circuit board, and is controlled by the zero\nand span circuits. Operation of the forcemeasuring clamp is easy: One simply\nslides the power switch to \xe2\x80\x9con,\xe2\x80\x9d adjusts the\ndisplay to zero if necessary, applies a\nclamping force, and reads the display.\nThe functionality of a \xe2\x80\x9cbreadboard\xe2\x80\x9d\nprototype force-measuring clamp was\ntested in a laboratory by use of the combination of certified weights, a load washer,\na strain indicator, and a voltmeter. Some\nalternate or future embodiments of forcemeasuring clamps may include smaller\nbatteries and/or smaller digital displays\nfor the sake of compactness, more options, and better packaging of all components. Force-measuring clamps and/or\nsimilar devices could also be incorporated\ninto other mechanisms.\nThis work was done by Mark Nunnelee of\nDryden Flight Research Center.\nThis invention has been patented by NASA\n(patent pending).

The specific joint\nfor which the modification is proposed is\na field joint in a reusable solid-fuel\nrocket motor (RSRM), in which the pressurizing fluid is a mixture of hot combustion gases. The proposed modification could also be applicable to other\npressure-actuated joints of similar configuration.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, April 2003\n\nThe RSRM field joint (see figure)\nincludes a pressure-actuated member\ndenoted the J-leg, which is part of a\nbody of insulation. A pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) is used to bond\nthe sealing surface of the J-leg to the\nsealing surface of another body of insulation. The pressure actuation is\nsupposed to push these two sealing\nsurfaces together. However, experience with the joint indicates that it\nmay not behave as a truly pressure-actuated system.\n\nThe modified version of the joint\nwould be the same as the unmodified\nversion, except that pockets of empty\nvolume would be introduced into the\nbody against which the J-leg is pressed.\nThe size, shape, and orientation of the\npockets would be such upon the application of pressure to the hot-gas side of the\nJ-leg, the volumes of the pockets would\nnot change significantly and hence the\npressures in the pockets, would not\nchange significantly; the net result\nwould be that the pockets would support\n\n7\n\n'
