This report\nsummarizes the activities of the Sejong station during 2012. The following are the activities at the\nstation. 1) VLBI test observations were carried out with the Tsukuba 34-m antenna of the GSI in\nJapan. As a result, the Sejong antenna needs to improve its e\xef\xac\x83ciency, which is currently in progress.\n2) A survey to connect the VLBI reference point to GNSS and ground marks was conducted. 3) To see\nthe indirect e\xef\xac\x80ects of RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) at this place, we checked the omni-direction\n(AZ 0\xe2\x97\xa6 to 360\xe2\x97\xa6 , EL \xef\xac\x81xed at 7\xe2\x97\xa6 ) for RFI in\xef\xac\x82uence.\n\n1. General Information\nThe Sejong station is the \xef\xac\x81rst geodetic VLBI station in the Republic of Korea which is dedicated\nto geodetic purposes only. The station is located about 120 km south of Seoul, in the middle of\nSejong City, which serves as a new administrative capital. The Sejong antenna is 22 meters in\ndiameter, and its slew speed is 5\xe2\x97\xa6 /sec in both azimuth and elevation; its speci\xef\xac\x81cations have been\ndesigned for the possible addition of other small antennas in the future.\nThe observatory was constructed on the top of a small mountain in Sejong City, which was\no\xef\xac\x83cially approved as a new town in July 2012. The city is a newly designated administrative\ncapital city planned by the government, and it will be developed in phases over the next 20 years.\nThe Sejong VLBI station was previously called \xe2\x80\x9cKVG\xe2\x80\x9d (Korea VLBI system for Geodesy) which\nwas named after the project purpose in its initial stage. However, now \xe2\x80\x9cSejong Station\xe2\x80\x9d is the\no\xef\xac\x83cial title to prevent possible confusion in addressing the station.\nNational Geographic Information Institute (NGII, http://ngii.go.kr) manages the observatory,\nand Table 1 shows the sta\xef\xac\x80 members of the Sejong station. A newly appointed site director, Mr.\nBaek Dong Hyun, started work in November 2012, and Mr. Joo Hyun Hee, who showed outstanding\nwork in Sejong VLBI construction, was transferred to another group. Sta\xef\xac\x80 at the observatory carry\nout the VLBI observation, baseline analysis, international cooperation including the IVS, antenna\nmaintenance, and management of the observatory.\nTable 1.

Sejong VLBI System\nThe Sejong VLBI con\xef\xac\x81guration is listed in Table 2. The IVS letter codes and the CDP and\nDOMES numbers have been newly registered during this year. The antenna has the Cassegrain\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\n135\n\nSejong Station\n\nNational Geographic Information Institute\n\nFigure 1. VLBI 22-m antenna, monument pillars 1 - 4, GNSS, and UCP (Uni\xef\xac\x81ed Control Point) layout.\n\nshape, and the 22-m main re\xef\xac\x82ector consists of 200 rectangular aluminium panels. Each panel has\nfour elevation adjustments at the edge of the panel, so that the antenna main re\xef\xac\x82ector surface can\nbe properly arranged.\nTechnical parameters of the receiver are presented in Table 3. However, some items are omitted\ndue to the antenna e\xef\xac\x83ciency improvement work. The Sejong station uses the Field System (version\nFS-9.10.4) and a K5 data recorder.\n\n3. Activities in 2012\n3.1. VLBI Observation\nThe Sejong antenna carried out several fringe tests with the Tsukuba 34-m antenna in Japan.\nA few observations failed to get fringes due to a wrong setting for time synchronization. After\nthat we successfully got fringes from all channels in the S and X bands. As a result, the Sejong\nantenna needs to improve its antenna e\xef\xac\x83ciency, which is currently in progress.\n\n3.2. Co-location\nWe performed a ground survey that used four pillars to tie the cross point of the axes of the\nVLBI antenna to the Sejong GNSS monument. Figure 2 shows the local tie layout in the site.\nThe antenna reference position was calculated by a 3D circle \xef\xac\x81tting method, with measurement of\nthe distances from the pillars to the re\xef\xac\x82ection sheet on the antenna surface. Therefore, a ground\nnetwork consisting of VLBI, GNSS, and the pillars was established. Monitoring for the antenna\nreference position and ground subsidence of the new site will regularly be done by local tie survey.\n136\n\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\nNational Geographic Information Institute\n\nSejong Station\n\nTable 2.

RFI Monitoring\nEven at the Sejong site, RFI is unavoidable. We scanned all directions (AZ 0\xe2\x97\xa6 to 360\xe2\x97\xa6 ) at a \xef\xac\x81xed\nelevation of 7\xe2\x97\xa6 to see the maximum values in S band (2.2 \xe2\x88\xbc 2.4GHz). Figure 3 shows the change\nof signal power. It shows that most RFI is detected over 2.3 GHz. It is also direction-dependent.\nIn other words, there was more RFI coming from the north direction.\n\n4. Future Plans\nWe will take on the following activities in 2013: 1) The Sejong station, as a new IVS Network\nStation in 2012, will participate in regular IVS sessions. 2) Antenna e\xef\xac\x83ciency improvement is\ncurrently in progress. 3) After that, we will proceed to join IVS observing as soon as possible by\ncontacting the IVS Coordinating Center. 4) A local tie survey is also planned.\n\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\n137\n\nSejong Station\n\nNational Geographic Information Institute\n\nFigure 2.
