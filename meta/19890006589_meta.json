With a new spacecraft design, three-axis attitude stabilization, new ground support equipment, and improved methods of image navigation and registration that use on board compensation techniques to correct images for satellite motion, NOAA expects improved performance over the current series of dual-spin spacecraft. To meet these expectations, planning is currently underway for providing the complex and intensive operational environment that will meet the challenge of operating the GOES-Next spacecraft. This paper describes that operational environment.", "title": "GOES-next navigation operations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T22:37:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890006589, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fiorello, John L., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "Computer Sciences Corp.", "location": "Silver Spring, MD., United States"}}, "id": "92716a6f521d41fcb25dda0bf131bd4e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19890006589, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Oh, In-Hwan"}, "organization": {"name": "Computer Sciences Corp.", "location": "Silver Spring, MD., United States"}}, "id": "9a10fb14ea474f68894c47daff764050"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19890006589, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ranne, C.
