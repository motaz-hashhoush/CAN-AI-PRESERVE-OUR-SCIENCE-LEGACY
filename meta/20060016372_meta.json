In general, its atmosphere displays major variation on an 11-year cycle. Throughout the cycle, the atmosphere occasionally exhibits large, sudden outbursts of energy. These \"solar eruptions\" manifest themselves in the form of solar flares, filament eruptions, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and energetic particle releases. They are of high interest to scientists both because they represent fundamental processes that occur in various astrophysical context, and because, if directed toward Earth, they can disrupt Earth-based systems and satellites. Research over the last few decades has shown that the source of the eruptions is localized regions of energy-storing magnetic field on the Sun that become destabilized, leading to a release of the stored energy. Solar scientists have (probably) unraveled the basic outline of what happens in these eruptions, but many details are still not understood. In recent years we have been studying what triggers these magnetic eruptions, using ground-based and satellite-based solar observations in combination with predictions from various theoretical models. We will present an overview of solar activity and solar eruptions, give results from some of our own research, and discuss questions that remain to be explored.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Ghana", "submissionId": 20060016372, "endDate": "2006-03-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Total Solar Eclipse: Astronomy and Culture Conference", "location": "Cape Coast", "id": "be27dbdaa3a9412c80545386c8068d4a", "startDate": "2006-03-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060016372, "id": "5d87bf9042bb4aba9ff3e53c8a03df1d", "publicationDate": "2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
