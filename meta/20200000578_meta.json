The term \"cutter\" refers to a Coast Guard vessel 65 feet in length or greater with accommodations for crew to live aboard and the ability to deploy smaller boats including the OTH-IV. A deployment method employed by some cutter class vessels is a davit crane system and specialized hook mechanism to connect the smaller boat. The launch and recovery operation requires several crewmembers, where one is tasked with releasing and connecting the hook to the small boat. Manipulating the hook can pose a risk to the crewmember depending on sea conditions combined with fatigue level or task expertise. Equipment and crewmembers are tested extensively due to the inherent risk of the task, but the sea conditions cannot be controlled. To address the sea condition variable, the U.S. Coast Guard and NASA leveraged the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) as a platform to test new equipment or train crewmembers in varying sea conditions. With 6 degrees of freedom and a vertical displacement of +/- 22ft, the VMS is capable of simulating conditions up to sea-state 5. The proof of concept experiment took place in September 2018 and demonstrated that the VMS can accurately simulate varying sea-states, collect performance data, and design a reliable and safe system for participants. The U.S. Coast Guard provided boat displacement data from the Large Amplitude Motion Program (LAMP). The program generates multi-directional waves with a cosine squared spreading function which produced a time history response of displacement data (surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch, yaw) of the OTH-IV's center of gravity (C.G). The displacement data was differentiated into acceleration evaluated at the crewmember's position at the front (bow) of the boat. Those accelerations were transformed to the VMS coordinate system and used as command inputs to the motion system's washout filters. The VMS uses Interchangeable Cabs (ICab) to perform flight simulations on a variety of aircraft or spacecraft configurations. An ICab typically contains seats, restraints, pilot controls, instrument panel, and out-the-window projectors all enclosed in a familiar cockpit configuration. To replicate the launch and recovery of a small boat, all the conventional features of a flight simulator and canopy were removed to be replaced with a to-scale OTH-IV bow mockup. The bow section was constructed from aluminum, and a connection point known as the davit ring. Additionally, a hook replica was suspended by a cable from the ceiling as if it were hanging from a davit crane aboard a cutter vessel. The last step was providing an auxiliary control to close the distance between suspended hook and the davit ring on the bow mockup. Without control the boat would simulate the wave motion, but with no guarantee that the crewmember will be in reach of the hook. Since the wave motion was repeatable, an additional acceleration command sent to the washout filters to move the simulator in the surge, sway, and heave directions, independently. The commands were rate limited such that the additional movement was not detectable with respect to the wave motion. The results showed that for each wave profile, a unique set of acceleration commands provided opportunities for crewmembers to gain control of the hook and connect it to the davit ring.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20200000578, "endDate": "2020-01-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "4e7f8d2d96e84ebb90b6bfc2b329c7cc", "id": "589c3f61c450474abeed8ee57f3ebe48"}], "name": "SciTech Forum", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "4e7f8d2d96e84ebb90b6bfc2b329c7cc", "startDate": "2020-01-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20200000578, "id": "81e0dcbf0da54456baea88b9255f235b", "publicationDate": "2020-01-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20200000442, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "U.S. Coast Guard Boat Recovery Simulation at NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20200000578.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20200000578/downloads/20200000578.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20200000578/downloads/20200000578.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20200000578/downloads/20200000578.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
