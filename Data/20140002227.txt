We present a Fourier-transform infrared\n(FTIR) spectroscopy analysis of fragments from several\nstones of the meteorite.\nMethods and analysis: Infrared spectra of samples\nSM2 and SM12 were recorded with a Nicolet iN10 MX\nFTIR microscope in the mid-IR range (4000\xe2\x80\x93650 cm-1;\nspectral resolution 4 cm-1), while samples SM20 and SM30\nwere analyzed with a synchrotron-based Nicolet Continuum IR microscope in the same range. Samples were deposited on a clean glass slide, crushed with either a stainless\nsteel roller tool or between 2 slides, and placed directly on\nthe focal plane of the microscopes.\nResults: IR spectra of non-fusion crust samples show\nseveral absorption features associated with minerals such\nas olivines, phyllosilicates, carbonates (calcite and dolomite), and pyroxenes, as well as organics [2]. The carbonates display a main, broad band centered at 1433 cm-1,\nwith additional bands at 2515 cm-1, 1797 cm-1, 882 cm-1,\nand 715 cm-1. Features associated with phyllosilicates include a symmetric Si\xe2\x80\x93O stretching mode band centered at\n1011 cm-1 and several O\xe2\x80\x93H stretching mode bands\xe2\x80\x95a\nbroad band centered at 3415 cm-1 that is probably due to\nadsorbed H2O, and occasionally a much weaker, narrower\nfeature centered near 3680 cm-1 due to structural O\xe2\x80\x93H.\nFeatures observed in the 2985\xe2\x80\x932855 cm-1 range suggest\nthe presence of aliphatic \xe2\x80\x93CH3 and \xe2\x80\x93CH2\xe2\x80\x93 groups. However, some of these bands show unusual relative intensities,\nmainly because of carbonate overtone bands that fall in the\nsame spectral range, which can make the identification of\nC\xe2\x80\x93H stretching bands problematic. The positions and relative strengths of the aliphatic \xe2\x80\x93CH2\xe2\x80\x93 and \xe2\x80\x93CH3 features,\nwhere they can be distinguished from overlapping carbonate bands, are consistent with those in interplanetary\ndust particles (IDPs) and Murchison. Finally, the absence\nof a strong C=O absorption feature near 1700 cm-1 distinguishes the organics in the Sutter\xe2\x80\x99s Mill meteorite from\nthat in most IDPs and in Murchison, but is consistent with\nthe organic matter in Tagish Lake.\nReferences: [1] Jenniskens P. et al. 2012.
