Inherent in the design of these systems is that the horizontal flight path and wind and temperature models be defined and input into the airborne computer before flight. The wind/temperature model and horizontal path are products of the flight planning process. Flight planning consists of generating 3-D reference trajectories through a forecast wind field subject to certain ATC and transport operator constraints. The interrelationships between flight management and flight planning are reviewed, and the steps taken during the flight planning process are summarized.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19850065533, "endDate": "1984-06-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "1984 American Control Conference", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "3c03f16998ea4bcdac911bb59bf6bb87", "startDate": "1984-06-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850065533, "id": "0df95476a19e4e298cf42be9cfde42ce", "publicationDate": "1984-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
