structure. The blue and green\nregions are hot coronal plasma near 10 MK.\nThe launch of a sounding rocket carrying an HSD payload to look at\nparticle and field interactions. HSD uses suborbital experiments to\ndevelop and test instruments as well as to conduct scientific research.\nTechnology development is a key aspect of the work done at HSD.\nThe Plasma Impedance Spectrum Analyzer (PISA) being integrated\nonto the FASTSat spacecraft at GSFC.\nSolar Probe Plus will be the first mission to skim the outermost layers\nof the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere to discover how plasma processes in the\ncorona accelerate the solar wind to speeds from 200 to 2000 km/s.\nComparing model results directly with observations is key to validating the models and understanding of what the observations can reveal. Here a 3D loop simulation has been used to generate the signal\nthat would be seen in Fe IX and X at 171A (~1 MK).\nA spectacular result from the IBEX spacecraft. This is an all-sky map\nof the interaction of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic fields with those of interstellar space.\nSophisticated 3D visualizations have become indispensible tools for\nmodelers in HSD. A magnified view of a model of two vortices in the\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere shows their rotation direction and speed.\nCoronal mass ejections are some of the most violent and spectacular\nphenomena in our solar system. All the complex physical processes\ninvolved can only be truly understood by using 3D MHD simulations\nin conjunction with observations.\nNew materials can lead to advances in instrumentation. A very robust\ntelescope mirror made from simulated lunar regolith materials opens\nthe possibility of producing large optics on the Moon.\nEducation and public outreach is a central theme to the work that we\ndo in HSD. We organize events that illustrate to the public the importance of the work that is done by the heliophysics community.\nThe thermosphere is a layer of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere that absorbs\nthe highly variable solar UV radiation, which can significantly\nchange its temperature structure. The effect of a solar eclipse on the\nthermosphere was captured by TIMED.\n\nv\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis report presents the scientific, technological, and flight project achievements of the\nGoddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Heliophysics Science Division (HSD) for FY09.\nHSD consists of 299 scientists, technologists, engineers, education and public outreach specialists, and administrative personnel dedicated to advancing our knowledge\nand understanding of the Sun and the wide\nvariety of domains influenced by its variability.\n\nHeliophysics is one of the four primary disciplines that form the framework for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Strategic Plan for Earth and Space\nScience.\nGSFC has critical enabling roles in nearly\nall Heliophysics science missions including\nmission formulation and development, instrumentation, data systems, and science\ntheory, analysis, and modeling.\nHSD made important contributions to the\nC/NOFS, STEREO, TWINS, IBEX, Cassini,\nand MESSENGER missions in 2009.\n\nHSD\xe2\x80\x99s Mission is to explore the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s interior and atmosphere, discover the origins\nof its temporal variability, understand its influence over the Earth and the other planets, and determine the nature of the interaction between the heliosphere and the local\ninterstellar medium.\nOur major activities include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Leading science investigations involving flight hardware, theory, modeling, and data\nanalysis that will answer the strategic questions posed in the Heliophysics Roadmap;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Leading the development of new solar and space physics mission concepts and supporting their implementation as Project Scientists;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Providing access to measurements from the Heliophysics Great Observatory (HGO)\nthrough our Science Information Systems;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Communicating science results to the public and inspiring the next generation of\nscientists and explorers.\nOur strategic goals are to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Open the frontier to space environment prediction;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understand the nature of our home in space;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Safeguard the journey of exploration.\nThis year HSD scientists completed and delivered three new flight instruments \xe2\x80\x93 the\nThermospheric Temperature Imager (TTI), the Plasma Impedance Spectrum Analyzer\n(PISA), and the Miniature Imager for Neutral Ionospheric atoms and Magnetospheric\nElectrons (MINI-ME). The Instrument Scientists, J. Sigwarth (670), D. Rowland (674),\nand M. Collier (673), respectively, are to be congratulated on this important milestone.\nThese instruments were developed jointly with the US Naval Academy under the aegis of\nthe Department of Defense\xe2\x80\x99s Space Test Program. They will fly on the MSFC FASTSat\nwhich will be launched in May 2010.\nThe Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission, Project Scientist M. Goldstein (673), is\nnow in Phase C. Critical to its success will be the Fast Plasma Instrument led by T.\nvi\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nMoore (670). The Critical Design Review for MMS and the Fast Plasma Instrument will\nbe held later this year.\nThe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Project Scientist D. Pesnell (671), has completed all environmental tests and is at Cape Canaveral awaiting launch.\nFY09 also saw the selection of HSD scientists and their strategic partners at other institutions for many new flight instrument, sounding rocket, science data system, and theory,\nmodeling, and analysis tasks. Chief among these excellent results was the selection of the\nSpectral Imaging of the Solar Environment (SPICE) instrument for the Solar Orbiter mission. SPICE is the result of strategic partnership between J. Davila and D. Rabin (both\n671) and D. Hassler of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder. When Solar Orbiter\nis on-station later in the next decade, SPICE will provide the first close-up views of the\neffects of the explosive release of magnetic energy in the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere during flares\nand CMEs.\nHSD scientists published 298 papers in refereed scientific journals in FY09 of which\n39% had one of our scientists as first author. We also gave 230 presentations at 74 different conferences (see Appendix 2 for details).\nNoteworthy among the publications are the IBEX and MESSENGER articles in Science\nwhich announced discoveries that are pushing back the frontiers of heliophysics. The\nIBEX team has produced the first all-sky map of the outer limits of our solar system using energetic neutral-atom (ENA) imaging techniques. It shows a bright band of ENA\nemission believed to be caused by the impact of the galactic magnetic field on the heliosphere. These results give the large-scale context to the point measurements recently made\nby Voyager. The MESSENGER mission to Mercury has provided the first observations\nof magnetic reconnection for the extreme solar wind conditions typical of the inner solar\nsystem. Analysis of these new measurements has led to the conclusion that magnetic reconnection at Mercury proceeds at a rate that is nearly an order of magnitude higher than\nat Earth. These results are of particular importance because magnetic reconnection occurs\nthroughout the heliosphere and it is the primary energy source for all of the forms of\nspace weather that are most important for our nation\xe2\x80\x99s space infrastructure.\nOther important science results included the initial published images of the global distribution of precipitating energetic ions in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s upper atmosphere, using the new\nENA cameras flying on the TWINS spacecraft. Cluster scientists also discovered that solar wind turbulence dissipates via kinetic Alfv\xc3\xa9nic waves, a result that may have profound implications for our understanding of how the solar corona is heated. SOHO and\nSTEREO measurements have been used to probe the exciting and perplexing extended\nsolar minimum. The EUV telescopes on these missions provide independent views of the\ninner solar corona from three different vantage points covering (currently) over 300degrees of the solar surface. Similarly their coronagraphs work together to define the\nstructure of the outer corona from just above the solar surface out to beyond the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\norbit. C/NOFS observations of the terrestrial effects of the deepest solar minimum in 100\n\nvii\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nyears have revealed the weakest levels of ionization in the upper layers of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s ionosphere ever measured.\nIndividual scientists and teams from HSD garnered many important professional honors\nin 2009. Keith Ogilvie was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, the highest\nhonor that NASA confers. Tom Moore was elected a fellow of the American Geophysical\nUnion, an honor conferred on not more than 0.1% of AGU members in any year. Roger\nThomas and Doug Rabin received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. HSD personnel\nwere part of a number of teams that received NASA Group Achievement awards, including the C/NOFS VEFI, Cassini Plasma Spectrometer, MESSENGER, EUNIS, and SunEarth Connection Forum teams. Sten Odenwald won the American Astronomical Society\nSolar Physics Division Popular Science Writing Award. Alex Glocer received the Ralph\nBaldwin Award in Astrophysics and Space Science from the University of Michigan for\nhis PhD thesis.\nLast, but certainly not least, we are very pleased to have had seven new civil service\nscientists join HSD in FY09. They are Steven Christe (671), Adrian Daw (671), Errol\nSummerlin (672), John Dorelli (673), Deirdre Wendel (673), Peter Schuck (674), and\nLarry Kepko (674). Of the 299 people in HSD, 61 (20%) are civil servants, 23 (8%) are\nco-located civil servants from other divisions, 116 (39%) are contractors, 18 (6%) are\nemeritus, 12 (4%) are NASA Postdoctoral Fellows, and 66 (22%) are university scientists.\nFurther news and developments regarding our organization and facilities, instruments,\nmissions, and science highlights can be found on our Website (http://hsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/).\nWe thank you for your interest in our programs, and welcome feedback via the website.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94James A. Slavin, Director\nNASA GSFC Heliophysics Science Division\nDecember 2009\n\nviii\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nPREFACE\n\nThis document summarizes the work performed in FY09 by members of HSD who conducted research, developed models, designed and built instruments, managed projects,\nand carried out numerous other activities that have made significant contributions to understanding the domain of the Sun. Unfortunately only a small fraction of these activities\ncan be even briefly highlighted in this report.\nIn the main body of the report we describe the scientific studies that heliophysics encompasses and the components of the HSD program at GSFC that help the heliophysics\ncommunity achieve its goals. As part of the HSD program, we do a great deal of scientific research. This is summarized in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 lists the publications and\npresentations made by members of HSD in FY09. In Appendixes 3 and 4, we give a brief\ndescription of both operational heliophysics missions and planned missions. We use\nmany acronyms throughout the report, which are in common usage and so are not independently defined in each section; acronym definitions are given in Appendix 5.\nThe production of this report was guided by Holly Gilbert, HSD Associate Director for\nScience, who, together with Keith Strong (SP Systems), assembled the contributions and\nchecked the report for accuracy, made suggestions regarding its content, and contributed\nto several sections. Julia Saba (SP Systems) and Yvonne Strong (American Society for\nMicrobiology) helped with the scientific and technical editing, and Elizabeth Serago\n(ADNET Systems Inc) and Keith Feggans (Sigma Space Corp) contributed by compiling\nthe large HSD bibliography. Graphics support was provided by Robert Kilgore (TRAX\nInternational and TIMS). Many others in HSD helped with useful and constructive suggestions concerning the organization of this report and its content.\nHolly Gilbert and Keith Strong\nDecember 2009\n\nix\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nx\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nHSD\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to further our scientific understanding of the nature and origins of the\never-changing physical conditions throughout the vast volume of space controlled by\nthe Sun, and in which humanity will function for the foreseeable future.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nHeliophysics is the study of the domain of the Sun\xe2\x80\x94the heliosphere\xe2\x80\x94from the nuclear\ncore in the center of the Sun where hydrogen is transmuted into helium, producing the\nenergy that drives changes throughout the entire solar system, to the edge of interplanetary space where the solar wind and magnetic fields cede control of the local physical conditions to the interstellar medium. That represents over 108 AU3 suffused with outflowing\nplasma, magnetic fields, and solar radiation, with temperatures ranging from near absolute zero to over 20 MK.\nThe heliosphere is an interconnected network of physical processes driven by a relentless\nbut varying outflow of energy from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation from\n\xce\xb3-rays to radio emissions, ionized and neutral particles, and magnetic fields. All these\nforms of solar emissions interact in different ways in the wide range of environments\nfrom the hot solar interior, through the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s thin surface layers, into the extended solar\ncorona, and throughout interplanetary space to the very edge of the solar system. Along\ntheir tortuous path, these emissions interact with different planetary environments, comets, asteroids, and interstellar gas\xe2\x80\x94each with its unique response to the changing solar\nstimuli. HSD\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to understand this system of systems.\nAccomplishing this goal involves the study of the complex interactions between electromagnetic radiation, plasmas, and magnetic fields, with three principal objectives:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To understand the changing flow of energy and matter throughout the Sun, solar atmosphere, heliosphere, and planetary environments\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To explore the fundamental physical processes that characterize space plasmas\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To define both the origins and the societal impacts of variability in the Sun\xe2\x80\x93Earth system\nThere are four major physical domains that encompass HSD\xe2\x80\x99s mission: the Sun, the inner\nheliosphere, geospace, and the outer heliosphere.\n\nThe Sun\nThe Sun generates not only energy, but also magnetic fields. The solar dynamo, combined with both radial and latitudinal differential rotation, generates magnetic fields and\nstores vast amounts of energy in them. Convection in the outer layers of the Sun and the\nnatural buoyancy of the flux ropes drag these strong fields (>104 G) to the surface, as\nevidenced by the presence of sunspots and faculae, which change the solar spectral irradiance that provides the energy to drive Earth\xe2\x80\x99s weather and climate system. Thus a substantial and persistent change in solar irradiance could significantly affect Earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate.\nEnergy is transported from the solar core region (the inner 20% of the solar radius) by\nphoton radiation out to about 70% of the solar radius. Then convectional transport takes\n1\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nover, carrying most of the energy to the surface of the Sun\xe2\x80\x94the photosphere\xe2\x80\x94where the\noptical depth of the solar plasma drops, so that much of the energy can be radiated away\ninto space. The falling temperature gradient as the energy flows outward seems well understood; however, just above the relatively cooler surface layers, the temperature of the\nplasma rises rapidly again to form a 1-MK corona. The physical processes involved in\ncreating and maintaining the corona are not yet completely understood.\n\nThe anatomy of the Sun\n\nThe energy stored in the solar magnetic fields is often released suddenly by magnetic reconnection to produce flares and CMEs. Flares produce emissions from \xce\xb3-rays to radio\nwavelengths, accelerate solar energetic particles, and transport material from the lower\nlayers of the atmosphere up into the hot corona via chromospheric evaporation, accompanied by ejection of material away from the Sun. CMEs are vast ejection events that can\ngrow to be many times the size of the Sun and at times move with velocities exceeding\n2000 km/s.\nAnother type of mass outflow from the Sun is more continuous but also highly variable:\nthe solar wind, which flows out along the spiraling solar magnetic field with velocities of\nbetween 300 and 700 km/s and having various temperatures, densities, and compositions.\nThe manner of its acceleration is still not completely understood.\n\n2\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nThe Inner Heliosphere\n\nThis is the region between the Sun and Jupiter that is filled with outflowing, supersonic\nsolar wind and frozen-in spiraling magnetic fields\xe2\x80\x94the Parker Spiral. The streams of solar plasma evolve significantly as they pass through this region, where fast streams of solar wind plough into slower-moving streams, forming shocks. Transients, such as CMEs,\nreshape the ambient environment. Some CMEs move faster than the local solar wind,\nbuilding up high-density fronts that form shocks where particles are accelerated to extremely high energies. CMEs can expand as they move outwards, leaving low-density\nregions behind the propagating front.\nElectrons flowing along the\nlarge-scale magnetic field\nlines, thus producing radio\nbursts of various types,\nshow which field lines remain connected back to the\nSun and which ones have\nreconnected.\nBecause of the spiral nature\nof the fields, Earth is better\nconnected to the western\nhemisphere of the Sun;\nthus an event near the west\nlimb of the Sun is more\nlikely to be geoeffective\nA CME propagates through the heliosphere towards Earth\nthan one in the eastern hemisphere. Photons take only eight minutes to arrive at Earth from the Sun, and highenergy protons can be detected a few minutes later, whereas material from a CME event\nseen on the Sun may take up to three days to arrive.\n\nGeospace\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field acts as a barrier\nto most of the harmful particle fluxes\noriginating from the Sun. Much of the\nsolar wind is deflected around the magnetosphere, which forms a teardropshaped shield around Earth. The shape\nand size of the magnetosphere change\nas solar wind conditions vary. Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nmagnetic field is compressed within\nabout 10 Earth radii (RE) on the sunward side of the planet and stretched\nout by many tens of RE on the antisunward side.\n\nStructure of the magnetosphere\n\n3\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nAt the location where the solar wind and Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field collide there is a bow\nshock region. The faster and denser the solar wind is, the more the fields are compressed\nand stretched. The direction of the interplanetary field profoundly influences the effects\nseen; a CME with an oppositely directed magnetic field will more likely reconnect, allowing more energetic particles to enter geospace, and producing a more energetic geomagnetic storm. The fields become weak and disorganized as they interact in the magnetosheath. The surface where Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic pressure is balanced by the solar wind is\ncalled the magnetopause; it often ripples and flaps in the solar wind, and parts constantly\nreconnect magnetically and break away. In the polar region, there is a path where the solar particles have easy access to Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere\xe2\x80\x94this is the cusp region.\n\nSome of the complex physical processes that occur when incoming radiation and\ncharged particles interact with Earth\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic atmosphere\n\nCloser to Earth, a completely different set of closely coupled processes occur. Here, solar\nUV radiation has one of its primary effects. UV light from the Sun, especially when enhanced by flare emissions, heats the neutral atmosphere thus increasing the temperature\nwith height in the thermosphere. Gravity waves are also present in this layer and drive\nchanges in the neutral atmosphere as they propagate up from below. The high-energy Xray and UV photons partly ionize the neutral particles and create another intermittent\nlayer of charged particles \xe2\x80\x93 the ionosphere. At times of high solar activity, these physical\nprocesses of heating and ionization are similarly intensified and cause increased scale\nheight leading to increased satellite drag, interference with HF radio communications,\nand larger GPS errors.\nHigh-energy electrons and protons become trapped in the Van Allen radiation belts. The\nouter belt gathers electrons from the aftermath of geomagnetic storms and substorms, accumulating enough plasma pressure to produce a ring-shaped current around Earth that\nsubstantially inflates the geomagnetic field. The inner belt originates from cosmic rays\n4\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\ninteracting with the upper atmosphere. Charged particles spiral along the field lines, mirroring as they descend into the stronger polar fields.\n\nThe Outer Heliosphere\nThe characteristics of the heliosphere change significantly past the\norbit of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x94this area is called\nthe outer heliosphere. Here, the\nsolar wind and transients interact\nwith the gas-giant planets, which\nare very different from their rocky\ncousins in the inner heliosphere.\nIn this region, the nature of the\noutflowing plasma also changes;\nthe interplanetary magnetic field\nbecomes mostly azimuthal and\nhence is perpendicular to the solar\nwind flow; and solar transients and\nThe boundary between the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s domain and interstellar\ninterplanetary shocks catch up with\nspace\neach other and form large, global\nmerged interaction regions. In addition, a larger portion of the solar wind is composed of\nphotoionized interstellar neutral particles, known as pickup ions.\nWith increasing distance from the Sun, the particle and field pressure of the solar wind\ndecreases until it reaches pressure balance with the local interstellar medium. This boundary is called the heliopause. However, before reaching this boundary, the solar wind\nslows abruptly below its supersonic speed at the termination shock, and starts deflecting\ntowards the heliotail, and continues slowing in the region known as the heliosheath. The\ninteraction of the heliosphere with the interstellar medium is analogous to the deflection\nof the solar wind around Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere. It is postulated that the interstellar plasma could also flow at supersonic speeds, necessitating the existence of an external bow\nshock and a pileup of interstellar particles upstream of the heliosphere, known as the hydrogen wall. In addition to low-energy neutral particles, the extremely high-energy galactic cosmic rays also enter the heliosphere, but not without first being modulated by the\nperiodically varying heliospheric magnetic fields. The termination shock and heliosheath\nare thought to also be the source of an extra, anomalous component of the cosmic rays\nobserved at Earth.\n\n5\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nHSD is an internationally recognized research organization dedicated to the furtherance of scientific understanding of all aspects of heliophysics.\n\nTHE HSD ORGANIZATION\nAt the end of FY09, HSD was composed of 299 scientists, engineers, and other staff supported by a small management and administrative team. Of the 299 people in HSD 61\n(20%) are civil servants, 23 (8%) are co-located civil servants, 116 (39%) are contractors,\n18 (6%) are emeritus, 12 (4%) are NASA Postdoctoral Fellows, and 66 (22%) are university scientists working under cooperative agreements.\nHSD is divided into four Laboratories, each with its own Chief, as shown in the figure\nbelow. HSD is supported primarily by competitively awarded funding from the NASA\nScience Mission Directorate with the remainder made up of assigned NASA tasks, GSFC\nresearch and development investments, and funding provided by other Federal agencies.\n\nThe responsibilities of HSD include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nScientific Research: HSD staff working as principal investigators (PIs), Coinvestigators (Co-Is), instrument scientists, and flight team members have published\n298 papers and given over 230 presentations at 74 different scientific meetings in\n2009 (see Appendixes 1 and 2 for details).\nProject and Mission Scientist Assignments: HSD provides the project and mission\nscientists who manage operating heliophysics missions, as well as missions in development (see the Missions sections, Appendixes 3 and 4, for details).\n6\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nFuture Mission and Instrument Concept Development: HSD provides scientific leadership and technical support for science mission concept development and formulation.\nData and Modeling Centers: HSD scientists lead and operate four major centers that\nprovide critical data services and simulation and modeling services to the heliophysics community. They are the Space Physics Data Facility, the Solar Data Analysis\nCenter, the Heliophysics Data and Modeling Consortium, and the Community Coordinated Modeling Center. These centers are funded directly by NASA and reviewed\nperiodically by NASA Headquarters-appointed external committees.\nEducation and Public Outreach (E/PO): HSD scientists, led by the Associate Director\nfor Science, carry out a variety of E/PO tasks supported by Project and competitively\nawarded funding.\n\nLike many Government, academic, and industrial research laboratories that perform basic\nand applied research in specialized areas, HSD has experienced recruitment challenges in\nreplacing retirees and recruiting new staff to attain its research goals while achieving\ngreater ethnic and gender diversity in the HSD workforce. For this reason, HSD is actively recruiting within the university community to attract new postdoctoral, cooperative\nagreement, and civil service scientists. Seven new civil service scientists joined HSD in\nFY09. They are S. Christe (671), A. Daw (671), E. Summerlin (672), J. Dorelli (673),\nE.D. Wendel (673), P. Schuck (674), and L. Kepko (674). HSD also has other student\ndevelopment programs to attract more young researchers to space science and retain the\nmost promising candidates.\n\n7\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nHSD\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to provide a safe and efficient work environment, consistent with being\na center of excellence for heliophysical research.\n\nFACILITIES\nHSD has people located in several buildings on the GSFC campus, primarily Buildings\n21, 22, and 26. Following the opening of Building 34, plans are in place to consolidate\nthe entire Division into Building 21 next year. Once this is completed, all HSD personnel,\noffices, laboratories, computer rooms, and other facilities will be housed in the same\nbuilding for the first time, which will facilitate more efficient intra-divisional communications, critical for project and mission success.\n\nExamples of the new clean rooms (left) and laboratory facilities (right) that are now installed in Bldg. 21\n\nIn FY09, the renovation of Building 21 continued. Initial design for all building renovations has been completed, and construction projects are scheduled for the next 18 months.\nThe most extensive project is the expansion and rehabilitation of the Space Plasma Instrument Facility. The original laboratory configuration included a 753-square-foot (ft2)\nclean room and a 935 ft2 laboratory space, and housed an electron vacuum chamber and\nan ion vacuum chamber. Once the expansion is completed in late 2009, the Plasma Laboratory will have a 1200 ft2 clean room, a 1000 ft2 laboratory space, and an additional\nelectron chamber. Completed renovation projects included updating two conference\nrooms and upgrading office space.\n\n8\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nWith a strong scientific base, HSD can function effectively to support and promote a\nvital heliophysics program at NASA\n\n2009 SCIENTIFIC HIGHLIGHTS\nWhile it would not be practical to feature, in detail, all the scientific accomplishments of\nthe HSD team in an annual report, a few outstanding examples of work that was successfully completed in FY09 are presented in this section. A short summary of individual\nscientific contributions is given in Appendix 1, and a more extensive list of publications\nand presentations can be found in Appendix 2.\n\nIBEX Discovers Bright Ribbon of ENA Emission\nThe Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft has released the first ever all-sky\nmaps of the interactions occurring at the edge of the solar system, where the Sun\'s influence diminishes and meets with the interstellar medium. Because the region emits no\nlight, IBEX collected ENAs traveling in from the interstellar boundary at velocities from\n150,000 to more than 4 million kph.\n\nThe ribbon of ENAs observed by IBEX mapped to a model heliopause surface. The arrows show the\npostulated orientation of the local interstellar magnetic field lines.\n\n9\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nENAs are created in the heliosheath, where the solar wind interacts with neutral particles\ndrifting in from the interstellar medium. ENAs can be created anywhere, but most come\nfrom this interaction region where the solar wind becomes slower, hotter, and more turbulent.\nIBEX has two large particle detectors that collect ENAs from a range of velocities. As it\nspins, IBEX views an annulus of the sky that sweeps the entire sky in half a year, and\nthen resweeps it during the next 6 months of its 12-month orbit around the Sun.\nThe surprising result is that there appears to be a strong impact of the galactic magnetic\nfield on the heliosphere\xe2\x80\x94in the form of a bright ribbon of ENA emission. The galactic\nmagnetic field drapes around the heliosphere, and, as best as the scientists can tell, the\nbright ribbon is where the magnetic field lies parallel to the boundary.\nThe IBEX all-sky maps also put observations from the Voyager spacecraft in context.\nThe twin Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977, traveled to the outer solar system to explore Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. In 2007, Voyager 2 followed Voyager 1 into\nthe heliosheath. They are now in the midst of the region where the ENAs collected by\nIBEX originate.\nHowever, whereas the Voyagers give two pinpoint "weather station" views of the interstellar boundary region, IBEX provides an all-encompassing "weather satellite" view. The\nIBEX results show that much of the activity is happening away from the two Voyagers\nand would not have been discovered without IBEX.\nIBEX is the latest in NASA\'s series of low-cost, rapidly developed Small Explorer space\nmissions. SWRI developed and leads the mission with a team of national and international partners. GSFC manages the Explorer Program for NASA\'s Science Mission Directorate.\nFor more details about IBEX, see Appendix 3.\n\n10\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nStereo Views of the Ring Current from TWINS\n\nEarly data from the TWINS spacecraft, the first ENA \xe2\x80\x9cstereo\xe2\x80\x9d mission, are showing the\nexciting scientific potential of stereoscopic observations using all-sky ENA imaging to\ncontinuously monitor the 1-60 keV ions in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s ring current. The results of a recent\nanalysis, independently confirmed by another mission, show the quality and utility of\nsuch observations.\nWhen TWINS launched in June 2008, the Sun was in its extended solar minimum state\nbut, on 2008 June 14/15, a small substorm was triggered by a recurring high-speed stream\nin the solar wind. SOHO EIT observed the large trans-equatorial coronal hole near the\ncentral meridian of the Sun that was its source region. A pair of simultaneous 40-minute\nexposures from TWINS 1 and 2 taken on 2008 June 15 starting at 0600 UT show the distribution of 10-keV hydrogen ENAs (the two images on the left side of the figure).\n\nThe parent ion (ring current) distribution is unfolded from the ENA images by forward\nmodeling of the ENA emission. The equatorial ion distribution (upper-right panel) is specified using a 32-parameter model. The parameters are adjusted until the simulated ENA\nimages (middle section of figure) match both of the TWINS 1 and 2 images.\nIn a further illustration of how various components of the HGO can work together,\nTHEMIS-D passed through the ring current region at the time of TWINS observations.\nIts orbit (dotted line) is over-plotted on the ENA images and ion distributions. The graph\n(lower right) shows the excellent agreement between the ion flux profile from the THEMIS nightside passage (red line) with the equivalent profile from the TWINS forwardmodeled data (white line).\n11\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nCluster Spacecraft Discover How Solar Wind Turbulence Dissipates\n\nMeasurements of the solar wind temperature, taken between 0.3 AU and more than 10\nAU from the Sun, have shown that heat is being added continuously to the solar wind. It\nhas been known for decades that the solar wind is turbulent. In turbulent fluids, large turbulent regions produce smaller regions in a cascade that proceeds to very small scales\nwhere the motions finally dissipate and the energy goes into heat.\nThe amount of heat that can be produced by dissipating turbulence in the solar wind is\nabout what is needed to explain the observed decrease in temperature with distance from\nthe Sun. Although there are many theories of how the waves are dissipated, earlier instrumentation was not able to observe the dissipation directly. Solving this problem is of\nfundamental importance to our understanding of how the solar corona is heated. New observations made by experiments on the ESA/NASA Cluster mission have indicated one\nsignificant channel by which the turbulence dissipates.\nThe analysis used several instruments on Cluster, including STAFF (Spatio-Temporal\nAnalysis of Field Fluctuation), designed to measure high-frequency magnetic waves, the\nlow-frequency (fluxgate) magnetometer (FGM), and the electric fields and wave experiment (EFW). Dr Fouad Sahraoui, a NASA Fellow (also LPP), Dr Goldstein (673), Dr\nRobert (LPP), and Dr Khotyaintsev (Institute of Space Physics, Sweden) found that solar\nwind turbulence extends down to scale sizes on the order of the electron gyroradius (from\n105 km to ~2 km) and, that at least for the conditions observed, electrons efficiently\ndamped the fluctuations.\nThe fluctuations were found to be kinetic Alfv\xc3\xa9nic fluctuations that were in a\nstate of strong turbulence. This is the\nfirst direct observation of the dissipation\nof solar wind turbulence at these small\n(electron) scales. The fact that the turbulence consists of kinetic Alfv\xc3\xa9n waves\nrather than, say, ion cyclotron waves\nthat interact predominantly with the\nmagnetic energy in the solar wind, may\nhave profound implications for theories\nof how the solar corona itself is heated.\n\nFirst measured spectrum of magnetic turbulence cascade in the solar wind, from large scale (105 km) down\nto the electron scales (~3 km). It reveals two new\nranges of scales (blue and green curves) never before\nexplored.\n\n12\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nSTEREO and SOHO Monitor Extended Solar Minimum\n\nSince 2007, the Sun has been in the longest period of minimum-activity conditions in 100\nyears. The Sun was spotless for almost three quarters of 2008; magnetic flux and coronal\nactivity levels dropped even further during the early part of 2009, although recently the\nSun has shown signs of returning life with minor new-cycle activity.\nSolar cycles during the first few decades of the Space Age had relatively active minimum\nphases. STEREO and SOHO together offer unprecedented coverage of the current longer,\nlower-level cycle minimum and the transition from solar cycle 23 to cycle 24. SOHO has\nprovided a 13-year-plus baseline for solar coronal and magnetic activity from cycle minimum to minimum from L1. STEREO gives \xe2\x80\x9cbehind the limb\xe2\x80\x9d views of the corona and\nCME activity that are invisible from a near-Earth or L1 perspective. Several GSFC scientists are using STEREO COR1 data to improve our understanding of the solar cycle by\ndeveloping daily 3D tomographic models of the corona, which can be tested before the\ncoronal structure becomes increasingly complex with rising activity. These models allow\nthe unambiguous determination of the region of origin of CMEs in the streamer belt,\nmore accurate computation of CME mass than previously possible, and clearer insight\ninto streamer recovery. CMEs play a key role in determining the mission profiles of LEO\nspacecraft and in planning extended human spaceflight missions beyond the protective\nshield of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere.\n\nTop panel: Two views of coronal structure contrasting the last (1996) and the current\nsolar minima (2009) as observed by SOHO. Note how during this extended minimum\nthe corona has not simplified to a simple dipolar structure as it normally does.

HSD looks at diverse physical processes from magnetic reconnection to\nparticle acceleration, shock formation to convection, and thermal conduction to nonthermal heating. This requires the use of many different observing techniques, both remote\nand in situ, from a variety of vantage points. In recent years, it has become apparent that\nlittle further progress will be made unless these phenomena are studied as a \xe2\x80\x9csystem of\nsystems.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA fleet of spacecraft, referred to in NASA Headquarters parlance as the Heliophysics\nGreat Observatory (HGO), is currently being flown. Each mission is addressing its own\naspect of the problems that HSD is trying to unravel. HSD is the nexus of these projects,\nhaving a management role in all but three of these missions and scientific participation in\nall of them (see the table below).\n\nThe HGO: Currently, heliophysics has three missions observing the ionosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere regions; four missions observing the\nmagnetosphere; six missions sampling the solar wind and heliosphere; and\nsix missions observing the Sun. These make up a powerful combination of in\nsitu and remote-sensing instruments.\n\n17\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nMission\n\nLaunch\nDate\n\nProject/Mission Scientist\n\nHeliophysics Flight Missions\nIBEX\nC/NOFS\nAIM\nTHEMIS\nSTEREO\nHinode\nSORCE\nRHESSI\nTIMED\n\n2008 Oct 19\n2008-Apr-16\n2007-Apr-02\n2007-Feb-17\n2006-Oct-25\n2006-Sep-22\n2003-Jan-25\n2002-Feb-05\n2001-Dec-07\n\nBob MacDowall (GSFC)\nRob Pfaff (GSFC)\nHans Mayr (GSFC)\nDave Sibeck (GSFC)\nJoe Gurman (GSFC)\nJohn Davis (MSFC)\nRobert Callahan (GSFC)\nBrian Dennis (GSFC)\nDick Goldberg (GSFC)\n\nCluster\n\nMel Goldstein (GSFC)\n\nTWINS\nTRACE\nACE\n\n2000-Jul-16\n2000-Aug-09\n2000-Mar-25\n1998-Apr-01\n1997-Aug-25\n\nSOHO\n\n1995-Dec-02\n\nWind\nGeotail\nVoyager 1\nVoyager 2\n\n1994-Nov-01\n1992-Jul-24\n1977-Sep-05\n1977-Aug-20\n\nHeliophysics Programs\nSolar Terrestrial\nProbes\nLiving With\na Star\n\nMei-Ching Fok (GSFC)\nJoe Gurman (GSFC)\nTycho von Rosenvinge\n(GSFC)\nJoe Gurman (GSFC)\nAdam Szabo (GSFC)\nGuan Le (GSFC)\nEd Stone (JPL)\n\nScientific studies of:\n\nOuter heliosphere\nIonospheric scintillations\nMesospheric clouds\nSubstorms\nCMEs\nSolar magnetic fields\nSolar irradiance\nHigh-energy flares\nThermosphere, ionosphere,\nmesosphere\nParticle / magnetic field interactions\nMagnetosphere\nSolar atmosphere\nSolar wind\nSolar interior, magnetic activity cycle, corona, solar wind\nSolar wind\nDynamics of the magnetotail\nHeliosphere\n\nJim Slavin (GSFC)\nChris St. Cyr (GSFC)\n\nThe Ulysses, Polar, and FAST missions completed operations in FY09.\nAppendix 3 briefly outlines (in reverse chronological order) the purpose and status of\neach of the current heliophysics missions and GSFC\xe2\x80\x99s role in them.\n\n18\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best present is a future\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the next-generation instruments and spacecraft will\ngather data in new ways from new vantage points, creating a vibrant future for heliophysics.\n\nDEVELOPING FUTURE HELIOPHYSICS MISSION CONCEPTS\nAt the moment, there are a number of future heliophysics missions in various stages of\ndevelopment. Key to the future of the HGO and the strength of this discipline are vitality\nof its strategic vision and the pipeline of new space missions that are required to realize\nthe vision. These missions always build on past scientific achievements and technical capabilities, but it is essential that they produce more than incremental results and that some\nof the more challenging missions be undertaken not in spite of, but rather because of, the\nchallenges they present to heliophysics and NASA. All of these missions are part of the\nSolar Terrestrial Probe (STP) or the Living With a Star (LWS) program. Heliophysics\nexpects a steady stream of grassroots-developed, PI-led Explorer missions that will\nachieve more focused, nearer-term science objectives. There are mission-of-opportunity\npayloads on other government and commercial spacecraft, and collaborations involving\ninternational missions (as with Hinode and SOHO). GSFC HSD scientists serve as study\nscientists and as members of the Science and Technology Definition Teams of these missions.\n\nThe next-generation HGO elements. Two missions will focus on the ionosphere, mesophere, and thermosphere\nregions; three missions will solve key questions regarding magnetic reconnection and charged-particle acceleration in the magnetosphere; four missions will measure the solar wind, determine its acceleration mechanism in\nthe corona, and its evolution as it moves out into the heliosphere; and four missions will probe the outer layers\nof the Sun, its atmosphere, and the eruption of flares and coronal mass ejections.\n\n19\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nNASA heliophysics missions planned to fly beyond FY09:\nMission\nSDO\nRBSP/ITSP\nMMS\nSolar\nOrbiter\nSP+\n\nPlanned\nLaunch\n2010 Feb\n2012\n2013\n2017\n\nProject/Mission\nScientist\nDean Pesnell (GSFC)\nBarry Mauk (APL)\nMel Goldstein (GSFC)\nChris St. Cyr (GSFC)\n\nScientific Studies of:\n\n2018\n\nRobert Decker (APL)\n\nOrigin of the solar wind\n\nSolar magnetic fields, corona\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s radiation belts\nMagnetosphere\nHigh-resolution solar imaging\n\nThe nature and timing of the missions may change as a result of the NASA Heliophysics\nRoadmap study and the National Research Council (NRC) decadal survey.

Dr Holly Gilbert, Associate Director for Science, leads the effort to coordinate and\npropagate the most effective ventures toward our outreach goals to communicate heliophysics scientific discoveries and advances, raise public understanding of space weather\nimpacts, and inspire the next generation of American space scientists.\nHSD projects and programs also respond directly to NASA Education and SMD E/PO\nrequirements, which include attention to partnerships, sustainability, a focus on customer\nneeds, and diversity. Key to the success of these activities has been the involvement of\nmany enthusiastic HSD scientists, whether directly interfacing with audiences, providing\naccess to data, or simply confirming accuracy of product content.\nThe E/PO Leads for ACE,\nHinode, SDO, SOHO, and\nSTEREO, and the entire\nSun-Earth Day team, reside\nat GSFC. A significant\nchange in the HSD E/PO\nstructure occurred when the\nSun-Earth Connection Education Forum ended in September 2009. This 11-year\npartnership between GSFC\nand UCB facilitated heliophysics E/PO efforts across\nthe country.\nDivision E/PO staff frequently provide presentations and workshops at educational conferences and other venues, sharing the science and interacting with these important audiences to learn how best\nto meet their needs. Coordinating efforts whenever possible, the teams work together as\nwell as with strong partners outside NASA. Along with day-to-day work, the HSD E/PO\ngroup routinely contributes to community service, assisting each other with proposal development, on review panels, and with professional development presentations at community meetings. Several personal, project, and funding awards were received in the last\nyear, including the AAS/SPD Popular Science Writing Award, an HSD Peer Award, and\nNASA grants covering several projects. SECEF received a NASA Group Achievement\nAward.\n21\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nHSD team members staff the GSFC Integrated E/PO Strategy Group, Education Policy\nand Implementation Teams, and their working groups. They regularly interact and coordinate with the GSFC Education Chief and the new Assistant Director for Science Communication. Strategic coordination and collaboration within HSD, with other GSFC programs, throughout NASA, with universities, and with other organizations extend the impact and make optimum use of resources.\nThe following sections provide an overview and sampling of the FY09 HSD E/PO Program.\n\nAdvanced Student Research Programs\nThrough summer intern programs, such as the High School Internship Program and the\nScience and Engineering Student Intern (SESI) program in cooperation with CUA, HSD\nsupported about 20 summer interns (high school and undergraduate), in addition to several graduate students through the Graduate Student Summer Program. HSD supported two\nstudents in the Cooperative Education Program, an important educational link between\ncollege-level academic study and full-time meaningful work experience, through a working agreement between GSFC and several educational institutions. The Graduate Student\nResearchers Program (GSRP) provides qualified graduate students, in residence at their\nhome institutions, with fellowship support on research projects of mutual interest to the\nstudent and the GSFC mentor; in FY09 HSD supported eight GSRP students. The NASA\nPostdoctoral Program (NPP) provides talented postdoctoral scientists and engineers with\nvaluable opportunities to engage in ongoing NASA research programs; HSD currently\nhas 14 NPP staff members and several other postdoctoral scientists funded through\nscience grants.\n\nK-12 E/PO Programs\nSun-Earth Day (SED) has the widest reach of all Division programs. It is a wellcoordinated collection of formal and informal E/PO programs, resources, and events under a unique yearly theme, highlighting the fundamentals of heliophysics, space weather\nresearch, and related missions. Events are hosted by educators, museums, amateur astronomers, community groups, and scientists at schools, parks, and science centers.\nThis year, SED was picked up in 47 countries including the US, with nearly 50,000\nteachers and 1.4 million students participating. Eight NASA Centers including GSFC\nwere involved. The program also develops podcasts and vodcasts, and as of this year provides updates on Facebook and Twitter. The SED website is rich in resources for every\naudience and contains an extensive multimedia section that includes virtual tours of ancient astronomy sites. Featured activities are added each year to enhance the theme and\ntell the interrelated story of the heliophysics missions.\nSeparate from SED, yet a significant component of it is the online Space Weather Action\nCenter (SWAC). SWAC provides students with the opportunity to monitor the progress\nof a solar storm from its eruption on the Sun to the associated changes in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere \xe2\x80\x93 accessing and analyzing NASA satellite data in the process. Over 3000 unique\ndownloads occurred during the first month after its update this year. Dozens of educators\n22\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nand over 100 students, including Native American tribal college staff members and students as well as teachers and administrators from the Bureau of Indian Education, were\ntrained for SWAC, either through NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Distance Learning Network or via video conferencing. One of the program\xe2\x80\x99s developers gave a keynote address at the 9th International Federation for Information Processing World Conference on Computers in Education in Brazil.\nThe Space Weather Media Viewer provides access to near-real-time space weather data\nand contains illustrations and visualizations for classroom or public use. Its value to SED\nand heliophysics outreach in general is obvious. The major upgrade this year \xe2\x80\x93 with higher-resolution images, mission videos, easier downloads, and better descriptions of each\nmultimedia product \xe2\x80\x93 was due to input and funding from Voyager, Ulysses, Hinode,\nTHEMIS, STEREO, SOHO, IBEX, and ACE.\n\nElementary / Secondary Education\nThe SpaceMath@NASA website is a collection of problem sets\nthat teach students about astronomy and space science by using\nmathematics and real-world problems. Problems are developed in\ncollaboration with Hinode, STEREO, THEMIS, and SDO, among\nother missions, using mission science data, press releases and discoveries. The site\xe2\x80\x99s popularity is growing, and it is the top return\non Google for \xe2\x80\x9cNASA + math\xe2\x80\x9d.\nSDO sponsors several formal education programs, including Day\nat GSFC, a field trip exposing students to a range of NASA career\noptions that involves meeting scientists and engineers. The Ambassador in the Classroom\nprogram, a partnership with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Aerospace Education Services Project, brings a\nscientist or E/PO professional into the classroom to share SDO-related science lessons.\nThe AGU and AAS meetings have proved to\nbe good venues for the K-12 Educator Reception, which provides local teachers with\nan invaluable opportunity to collect NASA\nclassroom materials and interact one-on-one\nwith scientists.\n\nInformal Education\nFamily Science Night, a monthly two-hour intensive science program for middle school\nstudents and their families, is an HSD partnership with the Astrophysics Science Division\nand the GSFC Visitor Center. Evaluation after three years shows that participants have a\npositive change in attitude toward science, and that even one session improves the likelihood that families will engage in external science-related activities.\nAn E/PO team member frequently provides training in heliophysics and planetary\nscience, and remote telescope operation to Girl Scouts, their leaders, and their master\ntrainers, both at training sessions and at special events such as star parties, planetarium\n23\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nshows, \xe2\x80\x9cNASA Day,\xe2\x80\x9d and astronomy club meetings. This year, our E/PO representative\npersonally interacted with nearly 1500 scouts, leaders, and family members.\n\nPublic Outreach\nThese projects cover a wide range of activities. As part of the all-volunteer Goddard Ambassador program, Dr Gilbert conducts guided tours of GSFC and gives \xe2\x80\x9cScience on a\nSphere\xe2\x80\x9d presentations to outside groups.\nSDO uses the most popular social networking tools such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,\nFlickr, and Blogger to post mission status and science information to reach a wider, more\ndiverse public and create stronger relationships with attentive audiences. After touring\nmuseums nationally, the Space Weather Center exhibit, developed in 2000 by a team of\nheliophysics E/PO specialists and scientists, was reinstalled at the GSFC Visitor Center\nand is being viewed by hundreds of students and members of the public annually. ACE\xe2\x80\x99s\nhigh-school-level Cosmicopia cosmic ray and heliospheric science website includes over\n400 unique "Ask a Physicist" questions and answers; the last year saw a 10% increase in\nmonthly accesses (averaging over 370K) and a 40% increase in unique users.\nAstroZone (held at AAS), a.k.a. Exploration Station (at AGU), is a science open house to\nshare NASA hands-on activities with local families, alongside local science exhibitors,\nthat encourages involvement beyond the initial event. Co-developed by the SDO E/PO\nLead, the program is a partnership with the Rochester Institute of Technology Center for\nImaging Science Insight Lab with the support of the SDO Project Scientist and scientists\nfrom other divisions and institutions.\n\nPublic Affairs\nSeveral HSD scientists have made appearances on national media, including Discovery,\nNational Geographic, and History channels as well as local news. GSFC also has the\nScientific Visualization Studio (SVS) producing superior quality images, animations, and\ndata visualizations for a wide range of heliophysics communications and science activities, including press releases, live presentations, print publications, television, and video\ndocumentaries. SVS debuted the \xe2\x80\x9cSentinels of the Heliosphere\xe2\x80\x9d film, which highlights\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s HGO fleet, at the SIGGRAPH 2009 International Conference and Exhibition on\nComputer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, where it was nominated for an Academy\nAward \xe2\x80\x93 http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/goto?3595.\nOther successful FY09 heliophysics stories include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSun Often \xe2\x80\x98Tears Out A Wall\xe2\x80\x99 In Earth\'s Solar Storm Shield\xe2\x80\x9d (12/16/08)\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/news/themis_leaky_shield.html\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow Low Can It Go?

These programs were selected because they required more\ntime to complete (such as Whole Heliosphere Interval analysis, and scientific\npublications and sessions presenting IHY results), or because of the importance of\ncontinuing the activity to ensure long-term success. In particular, the instrument\ndeployment and scientific collaboration programs with developing nations must continue\nif there is to be an impact on the researchers\xe2\x80\x99 participating nations.\nA new UN program called the International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI) was\nestablished to continue legacy activities of the IHY UNBSS program. ISWI was initiated\nat the February 2009 IHY closing ceremony at the UN in Vienna. A steering committee\nhas been established, and the first instrument coordination workshop took place on 2009\nNovember 19-20 in Rabat, Morocco. Additionally, an ISWI space science school for\ngraduate students is being planned for Autumn 2010 in Ethiopia.\n\nThe 100-page IHY final report was\npublished and distributed by the\nUN.\n\nA 370-page book on the IHY science, instrument development, outreach and history activities in 78 nations was published in 2009 by\nSpringer Press. The book is available on amazon.com\n\n27\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nThe congruence of expertise and experience in HSD makes it a natural center for leadership in the design and implementation of science information systems.\n\nSCIENCE INFORMATION SYSTEMS\nNASA builds and flies heliophysics spacecraft and instruments to collect observational\ndata and improve understanding of the heliophysical system and its detailed processes in\na classic research wheel.\n\nThe heliophysics science challenge is to understand consistently the physics and coupling\nof this \xe2\x80\x9csystem of systems\xe2\x80\x9d over many spatial and temporal scales. Science information\nsystems are then key to drawing data and science both from individual science investigations and across the boundaries of the individual missions and instruments of the HGO.\nIn addition, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Heliophysics Data Policy (see links on http://hpde.gsfc.nasa.gov)\ndemands open and useful access to NASA data by the broad national and international\nscience research community to ensure full scientific return to the public on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s investment in science missions and investigations.\nThe congruence of instrument design, physics, modeling, data analysis, and information\ntechnology expertise and experience makes HSD a natural center for leadership in the\ndesign and implementation of science information systems (SIS), working in close partnership with the external science and technology communities. Categories for systems\ncurrently defined in the Heliophysics Data Policy include:\n\n28\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\nMission/Investigation Data Facilities\nVirtual Discipline Observatories (VxOs)\nResident and Final Archives\nScience Data and Modeling Centers\nDeep Archive(s)\n\nThe evolving heliophysics data vision is a distributed set of mission and investigation data facilities closely tied to the scientists responsible for active processing of data. When\ncoordinated with active archives and data centers connected by Virtual Discipline Observatory (VxO) data location, retrieval, and user services, it ensures easy consolidated\naccess to usable data with views of the data customized to research discipline needs. In\ngeneral, heliophysicsists expect to leverage existing capabilities and services wherever\npractical but to support the introduction of new technology to enable a more distributed\narchitecture. The first versions of the VxOs are intended to follow a \xe2\x80\x9csmall-box\xe2\x80\x9d model\nfocused on finding fully described data relevant to research needs (e.g., selected by times\nwith parameters in a given data range from a selection of instruments).\nMission and investigation data facilities under HSD direction include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSolar Data Analysis Center (SDAC) support for SOHO, solar instruments on STEREO, and data from TRACE, Hinode, and other missions\nSTEREO Science Center (SSC)\nCritical support for SDO\xe2\x80\x99s distributed science archive and distribution system\nOperation of the Wind-Geotail (Polar-Wind-Geotail) ground data system\nProduction of higher-level Wind (MFI, WAVES), Voyager (MAG and CRS), and\nSTEREO (SWAVES) instrument products\nC/NOFS-CINDI data production\n\nTwo key HSD projects, the Space\nPhysics Data Facility (SPDF) and\nSDAC, are now defined as active\nFinal Archives of non-solar and\nsolar imaging data, respectively,\nfor NASA heliophysics science\nmissions.

In addition, the SPDF\nproject is now supporting the Virtual Space Physics Observatory interface, an effort to\ncomprehensively access heliophysics data holdings across these disciplines, leveraging\nboth the present inventories of the individual VxOs and other information sources.\nThe overall goal is to make better data more readily accessible to and usable by researchers in a given discipline across the boundaries of specific missions, instruments, and\ntimes, using an optimal mix of existing capabilities with appropriate standards and new\ntechnology to improve data access, and using tighter coupling to the data-providing\ncommunity to ensure that data are fully and properly described for correct and independent future research use.

The\nCCMC consortium consists of NASA, NSF, NOAA, the USAF Weather Agency, Directorate of Weather, Space and Missiles System Center, AFRL, the Air Force Office of\nScientific Research, and the ONR. CCMC\xe2\x80\x99s central facility is located at GSFC. The\nCCMC is supported primarily by NASA and NSF. At present, CCMC staff, consisting of\nspace and computer scientists and Information Technology professionals, is 11 FTEs.\nThe first function of the CCMC is to provide a mechanism by which research models can\nbe validated, tested, and improved for eventual use in space weather forecasting, such as\nis needed for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Vision for Space Exploration. Models that have completed their\ndevelopment and passed metrics-based evaluations and science-based validations are being handed off to the NOAA and USAF forecasting centers for space weather applications. In this function, CCMC acts as an unbiased evaluator that bridges the gap between\nspace science research and space weather applications.\n\nOverview of models at the CCMC\n\nAs a second, equally important function, the CCMC provides to space science researchers\nall over the world the use of space science models, even if the researchers are not model\nowners themselves. This service to the research community is implemented through the\nexecution of model \xe2\x80\x9cruns-on-request\xe2\x80\x9d for specific events of interest to space science researchers at no cost to the requestor. Model output is made available to the science customer by means of tailored analysis tools and data dissemination in standard formats.\nThrough this activity and the concurrent development of advanced visualization tools,\n31\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nCCMC provides to the general science community unprecedented access to a large number of state-of-the-art research models. The continuously expanding model set includes\nmodels in all scientific domains from the solar corona to Earth\xe2\x80\x99s upper atmosphere.\n\nScience Support\nCCMC science services are provided through Web access (http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov).\nHere, users can request calculations from more than 25 modern space science models,\nwhich are hosted at the CCMC through very positive collaborations with their owners.\nAfter a run request, the user will be notified via e-mail when the calculation is complete.\nAt this time, the run can be analyzed via tailored visualization tools, again via Web\naccess. These tools have been continuously refined for almost 10 years, primarily in response to user feedback. Recently added capabilities include Poynting flux calculations,\nmodel outputs, field-line tracing along satellite trajectories, movie generation, and time\nline capabilities.\nRuns on Request Cumulative Growth\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\nGlobal Magnetosphere\nIonosphere/Thermosphere\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008 Oct-09\n\nInner Magnetosphere\nSolar and Heliosphere\n\nThe utilization of CCMC Run-on-Request services continues to grow rapidly. CCMC run\nanalysis services are also used heavily. In 2008, an average month saw 4,200 visitors,\n19,200 visits, and 262,000 requests for pages. Similar statistics apply to 2009. Visualization requests from 870 users led to the creation of 34,500 visualization pages each month.\nThese monthly averages continue to increase from year to year.\nFurthermore, the CCMC staff continues to develop new means to support users in their\nscientific studies. In the realm of visualization, OpenDx-based visualization with enhanced 3D capabilities is now available for a number of different model outputs. With\nboth OpenDx and IDL-based 3D visualizations, users can request output in Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) form, which permits real-time, in-depth analysis of\ncomplex 3D structures.\n32\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nFurther science services at the CCMC include the provision of the Model Web, where a\nlarge set of empirical or analytical models, such as the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), are available for interested users for download or execution. CCMC is also\nsupporting space science missions, for example STEREO and THEMIS. Science mission\nsupport includes background science information derived from routine runs and calculations in support of specific campaigns or specific science objectives.\nAs in the past, the future of CCMC services will be shaped by the needs of the science\ncommunity. Community input is solicited formally and informally, through meetings,\ntailored workshops, and personal contacts.\n\nSpace Weather Modeling\nThe second focus of CCMC is bringing modern space science modeling to bear on the\nneeds of space weather forecasting. NASA and forecasting agencies as well as need models of proven forecasting abilities. Operational models must be robust, have accuracies\nthat are well understood, and be packaged in a manner that makes them easy to integrate\ninto existing computational environments. The operational models must also be capable\nof executing reliably in real time. With these objectives in mind, the CCMC tests models\n\nSample plots from SWAN site\n\n33\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nfor accuracy, robustness, performance, and portability. Model accuracy is tested in two\nways: through metric studies and through scientific validation studies. As a result, the\nCCMC can characterize the usefulness of these models for the forecasting role to which\nthey would be applied. By testing how the models behave with a wide range of inputs, the\nCCMC can establish regimes in which the models appear robust and identify regimes that\ncause the models to fail. Through exposure to a range of compilers and hardware platforms, the CCMC improves the portability of these models. Finally, by measuring computational performance, the CCMC establishes the conditions needed for each model simulation to complete in real time or better.\nPerforming these types of analyses on models in a protected academic environment might\nproduce less objective results. It is imperative that the models undergo tests in an environment that stresses them in the same manner as will occur at the operational agencies.\nAccordingly, the CCMC challenges all models by utilizing them in a quasi-operational\nsetting, namely the Run-on-Request facility, as well as through a real-time simulation\nsystem. For the latter purpose, CCMC has established various real-time execution systems, starting with solar and solar wind modeling of photospheric magnetograms, and\nmagnetospheric calculations driven by ACE data. The establishment of these systems has\nled to a wealth of expertise in the design and maintenance of real-time modeling. In collaboration with model owners, CCMC has created robust models of scientific and space\nweather utility.\nAs a byproduct of real-time model execution, the CCMC staff has developed various\nmodel products, or tools, which provide space weather-relevant information to interested\nparties. Driven by a mandate from NASA/HQ, CCMC has begun to provide and collect\ndata sources of relevance to the NASA Exploration Initiative, and to NASA SSMO. This\ninformation is provided to any interested entity on the Space Weather Awareness at\nNASA (SWAN) Web site: http://swan.gsfc.nasa.gov.\nOwing to the diversity of space weather-relevant information sources, space weather\nanalysis and forecasting will increasingly rely on access to distributed information providers. The SWAN site is a first step in the direction of information collection. While it,\nalong with further development activities supported by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Chief Engineer, addresses NASA\xe2\x80\x99s needs primarily, this information can also support other governmental as well as commercial space weather interests. CCMC therefore has ongoing\ncollaborations with USAF, NOAA, international space weather interests, and commercial\nenterprises in the US. An example of the latter is the Electrical Power Research Institute\n(EPRI), a jointly funded agency that collaborates in the evaluation of space weather modeling products for power grid uses.\nMore information about the CCMC and its capabilities may be found at the CCMC Web\nsite http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov.\n\n34\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT\n\nGSFC and NASA support new technology in the HSD through three programs. The main source\nof support at GSFC is the GSFC Internal Research and Development (IRAD) program, which\nfunds the development of new technology to support proposals to be submitted in response to\nfuture announcements of opportunity. The Technical Equipment program provides funding for\npurchases of advanced technology equipment and replacement of outdated equipment needed to\nsupport the development of new instrumentation. The Small Business Innovative Research\n(SBIR) program provides funding to develop new flight hardware and software concepts in the\ncommercial sector in support of future flight opportunities.\nThe GSFC IRAD program runs on an annual basis for each fiscal year. An announcement of opportunity is released in early June describing the requirements of the opportunity for the subsequent fiscal year. Step-1 proposals are submitted in late June. A heliophysics proposal review\npanel led by Dr Sigwarth, the Chief Science Technologist for HSD, with support from Dr Khazanov meets in July to rank the proposals and recommend to the Center-wide integration panel\nthose proposals that should progress to the second phase. Step-2 proposals are submitted in late\nJuly. The review panel meets again in early August to rank the Step-2 proposals and recommend\nfunding to the Center-wide integration panel. Funding approval by the Center-wide integration\npanel is contingent on the available resources and the relative ranking of HSD proposals with\nrespect to other focus areas within GSFC. In FY09, a total of 14 Step-1 proposals were submitted\nresulting in six projects funded by the GSFC IRAD program. An additional two projects were\nadded midway through the year. For these winning projects, the FY09 IRAD program funded a\ntotal of 12.3 FTEs and an additional $570.8K for procurements in support of the selected IRAD\nproposals. In FY10, a total of 18 Step-1 proposals were submitted resulting in 11 projects funded\nby the GSFC IRAD program. For these winning projects, the FY10 IRAD program funded a total of 13.5 FTEs and an additional $528.7K for procurements in support of the selected IRAD\nproposals.\nThe new technologies supported by the GSFC IRAD program cover a broad range of heliophysics topics. These technologies include radiation-tolerant ion mass spectrometers, radiationhardened extreme-environment ASICs; an image slicer for UV integral field spectroscopy; deployable radial imaging for velocity, electric field, and plasma density; a focal plane polarizer for\nsolar and heliospheric imaging; evaluation of new micro-channel plate technologies; ultrathin\nwindows for silicon-solid-state detector telescopes; a low-resource ionospheric sounder; a sparse\nsensor array for wave interferometry; TRL elevation of an advanced ASIC for heliophysics missions and instruments; and high-precision electric gate and miniature ion-mass spectrometers.\n\n35\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nCloseups of TTI, MINI-ME, and PISA integrated on the FASTSat spacecraft.\n\nThe teams working on three of the instruments selected for FY09 IRAD funding have included\nstudents from the US Naval Academy. Because of this cooperation, these three instruments \xe2\x80\x93 the\nThermospheric Temperature Imager (TTI), the Plasma Impedance Spectrum Analyzer (PISA),\nand the Miniature Imager for Neutral Ionospheric atoms and Magnetospheric Electrons (MINIME) \xe2\x80\x93 have been briefed to the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense (DoD)\nSpace Experiment Review Boards (SERB) and selected to be included on the respective SERB\nlists. As a direct consequence of this inclusion on the SERB list, TTI, PISA, and MINI-ME will\nfly on the FASTSat spacecraft of the Department of Defense Space Test Program in May 2010.\n\n36\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nHSD LINE OF BUSINESS\n\nLines of Business (LOB) were established at GSFC in 2008 to enable the Center to integrate\npriorities across all research areas. The leadership team consists of the LOB Manager, E. Park\n(460); Chief Technologist, M. Johnson (550); Chief Scientist, J. Slavin (670); and New Business\nManager, J. Breed (101). Essential scientific and technical support is provided by HSD Division\nSenior Staff (i.e., T. Moore, J. Sigwarth, and J. Davila). The research priorities are developed by\nthe HSD scientists in close communication with the LOB. These priorities then guide the allocation of the available research and development funding. Each LOB establishes yearly goals and\nimplementation plans focused primarily on near-term (3\xe2\x80\x935 years) new-business opportunities and\ntheir associated technology development requirements. The LOB goals and plans are reviewed\nby a Center integration team, then approved by Center management.\nThe HSD LOB has developed instrument roadmaps as a tool for correlating technology development, instrument development, mission development, and future competitive or directed opportunities for flight. The goals, implementation plan, and roadmaps are used in Center funded\nIRAD allocations, identification of technology gaps, and requests for B&P and any other available source funding for advanced work. In its two years of operation, the heliophysics LOB has\nbeen successful in developing a cohesive plan for heliophysics development at GSFC and increasing the funding received by the Division.

Adrian\n\nDr Adrian is a thermospheric-ionospheric-magnetospheric physicist who\njoined the Laboratory for Geospace Physics (Code 673) in November 2004.\nHe serves as Deputy Project Scientist on the Magnetospheric Multiscale\n(MMS) satellite constellation mission and is the Instrument Scientist for the\nDual Electron Spectrometer (DES) component of the MMS Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI). He received his BS (1989) and MS (1993) in physics from\nthe University of Iowa and was awarded a PhD from the University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2000.\n\nDr Adrian supports ongoing research\nefforts in collaboration with MSFC,\nUniversity of Arizona, University of\nIowa, and Southwest Research Institute.\nAdditionally, during FY09 he served on\nseveral NASA and NSF peer review\npanels. Locally, Dr Adrian plays dual\nroles for the Small Business Innovative\nResearch (SBIR) program; both as a\nDeputy Subtopic Manager for Subtopic\nS1.12: Lunar Science Instruments and\nTechnology and as a proposal reviewer.\nDr Adrian also served as a manuscript\nreferee to the Journal of Geophysical\nResearch and Space Science Reviews.\nIn addition to his responsibilities on\nMMS, Dr Adrian continues to pursue a A statistical map of the occurrence and distribution of plas+\nvaried program of advancing both the maspheric He during the recovery phase of a geomagnetic\nstorm. The nightside of\ndata\ndevelopment of novel plasma diagnostic low-probability region sector of the with is the presence of a\nassociated\nthe formation and\ninstrumentation and basic research evolution of an embedded plasmaspheric trough.\nreaching from the thermosphere through\nthe solar wind to the furthest extent of the heliosphere. During FY09 Dr Adrian lead an IRAD\neffort to prototype the Electron Concentration vs. Height from an Orbiting Electromagnetic\nSounder (ECHOES): a simple, low-resource, space-based radio-sounding experiment designed to\ngather measurements of the altitude profile of electron density (Ne) for implementation on future\nheliophysics missions. In addition, he initiated an effort to implement and advance at GSFC a\nminiaturized electron spectrometer originally developed at MSFC. The Goddard Thermal Electron Capped Hemisphere Spectrometer (G-TECHS) is a miniature spectrometer designed specifically to measure the electron distribution of planetary atmospheres. Dr Adrian also conducts research into inner-magnetospheric coupling through efforts to understand the dynamical processes\nthat generate and circulate plasma through Earth\xe2\x80\x99s plasmasphere.\n\n39\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nVladamir Airapetian\nSince 1995, Dr Airapetian has been an astrophysicist at GSFC (currently in\nCode 671) and a Research Associate Professor at George Mason University.\nHe has a broad range of interests including the physics of solar coronal heating, MHD models of coronal streamers, physics of mega aurorae from extrasolar planets around young Sun-like stars, and MHD models of stellar winds\nfrom late-type evolved stars.\nDr Airapetian has been actively working in three major areas. First, he has\ndeveloped a model that calculates 3D synthetic images of solar coronal loops\nobtained by extrapolating an observed photospheric magnetogram into the corona and nanoflaredriven impulsive heating. By determining which set of nanoflare parameters best reproduces actual observations, he hopes to constrain the properties of the heating and ultimately to reveal the\nphysical mechanism. Second, Dr Airapetian has performed semi-empirical MHD simulations of\nan equatorially confined streamer belt by using\nobservational constraints in 2.5D MHD modeling. Third, he has developed a 1D HD model\nof exoplanetary hot and dynamic mega aurorae\ndriven by the collisional heating due to precipitating particles caused by the interaction of\nmassive stellar winds with exoplanetary magnetospheres. Based on the model predictions,\nhe suggests an observational technique to\ndetect and characterize extrasolar giant planets.\nDr Airapetian is currently supporting the "Coronal Heating Origins of Solar Spectral Irradiance" project led by Dr J. Klimchuk and\n"Empirical Determination of Effective Heat\nFlux and Temperature Using Semi-Empirical\n2D MHD Model of the Solar Corona and The\nSolar Wind" led by Dr Sittler.\n\nA 2D MHD simulation of an equatorial streamers\n(above) and a 3D synthetic image in 171\xc3\x85 of the AR\nNOAA 10938 (below)\n\nHis research areas are\n\xe2\x80\xa2 3D modeling of solar coronal loops driven\nby nanoflare heating\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multidimensional MHD simulations of\nthermodynamics and kinematics of solar\ncoronal streamers\n\xe2\x80\xa2 MHD and HD simulations of colliding\nstellar and exoplanetary winds driven by\nthe wind-magnetosphere interactions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 MHD simulations of massive winds from\nevolved giants.\n40\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nSachiko Akiyama\n\nDr Akiyama is a postdoctoral researcher at CUA. She received her PhD in\nastronomical science from the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in\nMarch 2001. Her primary interest is solar eruptive events, such as flares, filament eruptions, and CMEs. She is also interested in the relationship between solar eruptions and related signatures of the interplanetary medium.\n\nDr Akiyama is working with Dr Gopalswamy and his group in solarterrestrial physics. Her main task is data analysis and solar source identification of CMEs, magnetic clouds (MCs), solar energetic particles (SEPs), etc.\nShe also conducts research with Dr Sterling, MSFC, regarding causal mechanisms of filament\neruptions. They perform statistical studies of eruptive prominences in quiescent regions, focusing\non the very slow rise phase before eruption.\nSolar-terrestrial physics is one of the prominent topics for solar and geophysical scientists. Flares\nand CMEs with huge amounts of energy (about 1032 erg) have a great impact on the interplanetary medium and the environment of Earth. When strong geomagnetic disturbances associated with\nlarge CMEs reach the Earth, an aurora or a radio disturbance is sometimes observed at high latitudes.\nFilament eruptions are one of the solar sources of CMEs. Though several theoretical models of\ntheir trigger have been proposed, the prime mechanism is still a matter of debate. In a study of\nthe trajectories of 16 eruptive prominences using theSOHO/EIT data, all events\nshow a slow-rising motion\nover a long time (>12 h) before the fast eruptive motion.\nThe average speeds of the\nslow and fast rise phases are\n1.2 and 46 km/s, respectively. The fast rising speed\nshows a weak correlation\nwith the average magnetic\nfield strength under the filament, but the slow rising\nspeed does not. Of 16\nevents, 3 show several stepwise trajectories during the\nslow rise phase. The duration of the steps decreases Height time-plot of the eruptive filament on 1998 January 3. Blue-dashed\nwith time.\nand red-dotted lines are the start and end time of the flat speed period.\n\n41\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nSpiro Antiochos\n\nDr Antiochos joined GSFC in January 2008 as a Research Astrophysicist in\nthe Space Weather Laboratory. He has been an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences, University of Michigan, where he was the Research Supervisor for two PhD students. He obtained his PhD at Stanford University in applied physics.\n\nDr Antiochos is Chair of the Living with a Star Targeted Research and Technology Steering Committee (TSC). He is responsible for the 2009 TSC report\n(http://lws-trt.gsfc.nasa.gov/trt_sc report09.pdf). He served on the PhD Thesis\nCommittee for Dr Justin Edmondson, U. Michigan. He also served on the External Advisory Committee of the Center for Solar Research and Big Bear Observatory, New\nJersey Institute of Technology and produced the 2009 Advisory Committee report. He also\nserved on the \xe2\x80\x9cRed Team\xe2\x80\x9d that reviewed the Solar Orbiter Phase-A Proposal to ESA.\nHe is the PI of a successful proposal to the LWS TR&T Program that integrates theory work for\nmuch of the Space Weather Lab. He was selected by NASA HQ to be Team Leader of the Focus\nTeam on Kinetic-Global Coupling.\nDr Antiochos\xe2\x80\x99 main research theme is solar/heliospheric theory and modeling, with goals of understanding:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe initiation of CMEs/eruptive flares, the primary\ndrivers of the most destructive space weather. He has\ndemonstrated that the breakout model produces the\nobserved rotation in CMEs.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCoronal jets, one of the most ubiquitous forms of solar activity and a major process coupling the corona\nand wind. He proposed and demonstrated a twist release model for jets and demonstrated that it successfully produces the observed velocities.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe slow solar wind; its origin has long been one of\nthe outstanding problems in solar/heliospheric physics. He proposed a new model for the wind (the Sweb model) based on the topological constraints to\nthe open-closed boundary derived in recent work.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSimulation of twist release model for coronal jets. Open magnetic field lines are\nshown in white, initially closed in blue,\nand enhanced density in light blue.\n\nMagnetic reconnection, the fundamental process\ncoupling plasma and field in the solar atmosphere and\nthe process underlying most solar activity. He demonstrated that interchange reconnection\nmaintains a smooth topology in the coronal field and does not lead to the mixture of open and\nclosed field proposed by a number of heliospheric models.\n\n42\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nManuel Luna Bennasar\n\nDr Bennasar is a solar physicist. He has conducting numerical investigations\nof solar prominences and coronal heating with Dr Karpen at GSFC since\nSeptember 2009.\nDr Bennasar obtained his PhD at the University of Balearic Island, working\non transverse oscillations of flux tube ensembles of the solar corona.\n\nTransverse oscillation of a multi-stranded loop.

He was a scientific member of the first wintering-over party at\nthe Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station (1957), Assistant Prof (teaching) in\nthe Department of Astronomy at the University of Minnesota (1963/64 academic yr), and NASA/NRC Postdoctoral Resident Research Associate at GSFC. He joined\nGSFC as scientific civil servant in October 1965. He reviewed numerous papers for scientific\njournals and books, served on a PhD examining committee, and mentored high-school students\nfrom the National Space Club Scholars program.\nHe directed the GSFC International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies (ISIS) data restoration and\npreservation effort that produced digital topside ionograms from a select subset of the original 7track analog telemetry tapes, which preserved a global sample of ionospheric topside-sounder\ndata covering a time interval of more than one solar cycle. This data preservation effort enabled\nionospheric topside-sounder data, dating back to 1966, to be made available in digital form.\nOne of Dr Benson\xe2\x80\x99s current research goals is to establish links between solar-wind and topsideionospheric parameters based on the earlier demonstration of such a link between variations in\nthe solar-wind quasi-invariant (QI \xe2\x80\x93 the ratio of the\nsolar wind magnetic pressure to the solar wind ram\npressure) and the magnetospheric plasma parameter fpe/fce (ratio of the electron plasma frequency to\nthe electron cyclotron frequency) as illustrated in\nthe figure. Alouette/ISIS topside-sounder data, including recently produced digital ionograms, will\nbe used to determine if solar-wind drivers directly\nmodify the high-latitude topside ionosphere.\nRecent research involving magnetic field line conjunctions between Explorer 45 and ISIS 2 indicated that plasmapause field lines are located near\nthe minimum of the night time main (midlatitude)\nionospheric electron-density trough at low altitudes (~600 km) but at higher altitudes they are\nlocated on the sharp low latitude trough boundary.\n\n44\n\nComparison of solar-wind QI & IMAGE/RPI\npolar-cap fpe/fce variations near 8 RE with a 3-hr\ntime shift [Osherovich et al., JGR, 2007].\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nAnand Bhatia\n\nDr Bhatia has an emeritus appointment to work in atomic physics and solar\nphysics.

He is a Research Professor at\nGeorge Mason University working on the SESDA contract in GSFC\xe2\x80\x99s Heliospheric Physics Laboratory. Dr Bilitza first came to GSFC as an AE GI in\n1979 then returned in 1985, working first at the NSSDC and later at the\nSPDF. He received his Diploma and PhD in physics from the Albert-Ludwigs\nUniversity in Freiburg, Germany.\n\nDr Bilitza is the chief support scientist at the Space Physics Data Facility\n(SPDF) that maintains the CDAWeb, SSCWeb, and OMNIweb services which are widely used\nin the science community. Recent science collaborations involved scientists from\nNASA/Langley, NOAA/NGDC, JHU/APL, Ohio State University, University of Colorado\nBoulder, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Rhodes University in South Africa, Institute of\nAtmospheric Physics in the Czech Republic, and German Geodetic Institute in Germany. Dr Bilitza was a member of the US delegation to the International Standardization Organization meeting in Berlin, Germany (2009 May 18-22).\nDr Bilitza\'s main research efforts in 2009\nwere directed towards improvements of the\nIRI model with special focus on storm-time\neffects on the E-region ionosphere and on\nthe solar cycle variation of topside temperatures and densities.\nHe is working with TIMED GUVI and\nSABER team members and data to develop\na new model that includes the contribution\nof auroral energetic electrons which is now\nbeing prepared for inclusion in IRI.\nDr Bilitza\xe2\x80\x99s modeling of solar cycle effects\nneeds a large data volume and therefore\nrequires the combination of ground and\nspace data. A comprehensive analysis of\nsimultaneous ground and space data for the Difference between simultaneous measurements of topside\nelectron temperature measured by the Millstone Hill radar\ntopside electron temperature showed that and by the DMSP satellites\nthere are still systematic discrepancies between the two techniques at low solar activities (= low electron densities). The figure on the right\nshows differences of up to 1000 K or about 30%.\n\n46\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nStephen Bradshaw\nDr Bradshaw is an astrophysicist in the Solar Physics Group at GSFC and a\nResearch Assistant Professor at George Mason University. Hailing from the\nU.K., he has a PhD from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge, and was a Science and Technology Facilities Council Post-doctoral Research Fellow at Imperial College\nLondon before arriving at GSFC in January 2009.\nDr Bradshaw develops analytical and numerical models for application to\nsolar coronal loops. Through detailed comparisons between the predictions of\ntheoretical models and observations made by satellites such as SOHO, TRACE, RHESSI, Hinode, and the forthcoming SDO, important insights into the physics governing these fundamental\ncomponents of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere can be obtained. The ultimate aim is to understand the mechanisms responsible for heating the corona to million degree temperatures \xe2\x80\x93 one of the outstanding problems in modern astrophysics.\nRecently Dr Bradshaw has developed an extremely efficient numerical solver for the system of\ntime-dependent detailed-balance equations governing the ionization state of astrophysical plasmas. Both the dominant and minor ion populations are accurately treated. Non-equilibrium ionization effects are often neglected from observational and modeling studies due to their significant computational demands. The new code can calculate the ionization state for rapidly evolving plasma in just a few seconds on a standard desktop computer. Dr Bradshaw and others have\nshown that small-scale, impulsive heating events of the type generally thought to heat the solar\ncorona could be entirely missed by observing instruments as a consequence of non-equilibrium\nionization. Instruments must be designed specifically to detect the observable signatures of heating, which appropriate models can help to\nidentify.\nIn ongoing work Dr Bradshaw has shown\nthrough analytical and numerical models that\nthe bulk downflows observed in active regions\nby the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on\nHinode are consistent with a flux of enthalpy\nfrom the corona powering the transition region\nradiation. This marks a significant departure\nfrom previous ideas concerning the energy\nbalance. The agreement between the models\nand observations provides substantial evidence\nin favor of impulsive heating if each coronal\nloop is composed of many sub-resolution\nstrands that are heated and cooled independently.\n\nA theoretical velocity map showing the predicted\ndistribution of bulk downflows and their magnitudes\nin an active region.\n\n47\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nBen Breech\n\nDr Breech joined GSFC in September 2008 as an NPP Fellow after completing PhD degrees in computer science and physics at the University of Delaware. He is currently part of the Laboratory for Geospace Physics.\nDr Breech studies turbulence in the solar wind, in both the super-Alfv\xc3\xa9nic and\nsub-Alfv\xc3\xa9nic coronal regimes. This work leads to and improves understanding\nof how the Sun interacts with the solar system as well as the celestial environment the Earth moves in. His current work focuses on developing models\ndescribing the transport of fluctuations in the corona.\n\nJeff W. Brosius\n\nDr Brosius received his BA in physics from Franklin and Marshall College,\nLancaster, PA, in 1980, and his PhD in physics from the University of Delaware through the Bartol Research Institute, Newark, DE, in 1985. He has been\nwith CUA since 2002.\n\nHis research during FY09 focused on flare dynamics based on rapid cadence\n(9.8 s) EUV spectra from SOHO\xe2\x80\x99s CDS, coordinated when possible with EIT,\nMDI, RHESSI, and/or TRACE. Investigation of a microflare in collaboration\nwith Dr Holman revealed the same properties and behavior shown by larger\nflares undergoing gentle chromospheric evaporation driven by nonthermal electrons. The possibility that magnetic reconnection occurred low in the solar atmosphere, possibly even in the\nchromosphere, was presented for further investigation. A subsequent investigation of a GOES\nM1.5 flare revealed that chromospheric\nevaporation converted from explosive during the event\xe2\x80\x99s first impulsive burst seen in\nO V and Fe XIX emission, to gentle during\nits second. The change was likely due either\nto an increased absorption of beam energy\nduring the gentle event because the beam\npassed through an atmosphere modified by\nthe earlier explosive event, or to a weakening of the coronal magnetic field\xe2\x80\x99s ability to\naccelerate nonthermal particle beams (via\nreconnection) as the flare progressed, or\nboth.

He is a Co-I\non the magnetic field and plasma instruments on Voyager 1 & 2, the SECCHI\ninstrument on STEREO, the magnetic field instrument on ACE, the plasma\ninstrument on WIND, and a theoretical team studying the dynamics of the distant heliosphere. He received his BS from the University of Chicago and MS\nand PhD from the University of Minnesota. He joined GSFC in 1968.\n\nA principal result this year was the determination of the radial variation of the magnetic field\nstrength in the inner heliosheath (the subsonic region beyond the termination shock) based on\nVoyager 1 observations. The magnetic field strength is increasing as Voyager 1 moves through\nthe heliosheath from the termination shock toward the heliopause. In order to derive this result, it\nwas necessary to correct for the decreasing magnetic field as a result of historically weak magnetic fields observed at 1 AU during the approach to the current solar minimum. This correction\nwas possible because we can predict the decreasing magnetic field strength in the solar wind\nfrom observations at the Sun and near 1 AU by using Parker\xe2\x80\x99s spiral field model, which was verified by Voyager 1 between 1 AU and 94 AU.\nDr Burlaga presented an invited talk at the SHINE conference demonstrating the fundamental\nimportance of nonextensive statistical mechanics in the dynamics of the heliosphere.

Understanding how the inner magnetosphere\nevolves is critical for space weather applications; therefore\nher work is important for understanding the effects of solar activity on the Earth and its space environment.\nIn FY09, Dr Buzulukova finished studying one-way\ncoupling between CRCM and BATSRUS. It has been\nshown that inclusion of self-consistent electric field in\nMHD-ring coupled models is critical for ring-current dynamics. With CRCM-BATSRUS, she studied a case with\nidealized substorm and development of injection in the\ninner magnetosphere. For real storms, the model reproduces the main features of storm ring current as seen by\nthe IMAGE/HENA instrument.

His research is focused primarily on measuring and modeling of the solar X-ray and ultraviolet irradiance. Dr Chamberlin leads the continued improvement of the Flare Irradiance Spectral Model (FISM), which not only improved the ability to empirically model the solar cycle and solar rotation irradiance variations in the\nVUV wavelengths (0.1-190 nm), but also added the ability to model the irradiance variations due to solar flares. He also continues to collaborate with researchers from the University of Michigan, NCAR\xe2\x80\x99s High Altitude Observatory, and Boston University to study the impact of solar flares on the atmospheres of Earth and Mars. Dr Chamberlin has also been involved with various tasks on soundingrocket payloads, where the most recent launch in April 2008 led to the definitive measurement of\nthe solar EUV irradiance during solar minimum conditions. He continues to be involved with the\nTIMED SEE data analysis, SDO EVE development, calibrations, and science analysis, as well as\nthe development of the GOES-R EXIS instruments (XRS and EUVS), and is also a Co-I on the\nupcoming MAVEN mission working with the LPW-EUV instrument.

His group has developed a material (\xe2\x80\x9clunar cement\xe2\x80\x9d) that uses lunar regolith simulants to make a substance that is demonstrably harder than concrete. The fabrication process is simple, does not require water, and can take place under lunar conditions of vacuum and radiation. Preliminary tests suggest that the substance may be very stable.\n\nThis leads to a concept of fabricating large telescopes and radio interferometers on the Moon and then either deploying in situ or launching into deep space. On a much\nsmaller scale, work is in progress to use the lunar cement to make replicas of Galileo\xe2\x80\x99s original\ntelescope by using different lunar regolith simulants. One effort, undertaken in collaboration with\ncolleagues at the University of Dallas, makes the Galilean telescopes using JSC-1A simulant. A\nparallel effort in collaboration with colleagues at the Beijing Astronomical Observatory makes\nuse of the CAS-1 simulant developed in China.\nDrs Chen, Rabin and Van Steenberg collaborated on the invention of a two-axis instrument\npointing system using high-temperature superconductor (HTS) bearings. Unlike previous designs, this new configuration is simple and easy to implement. Most importantly, it can be scaled\nto accommodate instruments ranging in size from decimeters (laser communication systems) to\nmeters (solar panels, communication dishes, optical telescopes, optical interferometers) to decameters and beyond (VLA-type radio interferometer elements). A working prototype is currently\nunder construction.\n\nA prototype telescope mirror made using lunar\ncement.

She received both\nher BS and MS in theoretical physics from the University of Puerto Rico at\nMayag\xc3\xbcez, Puerto Rico, in 2004 and 2007 respectively.\nAt GSFC she has been involved in E/PO activities and panels from the Science Exploration Directorate for Undergraduate and High School students to encourage them to pursue and to continue working in the scientific research.\nYari\xe2\x80\x99s current research is based on visualizing vortices caused by instabilities along the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nmagnetopause, using MHD simulations: the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) code and the BATSR-US code. Vortices are thought to be a source of energy and mass transport to the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere, but their mechanisms are not completely understood. The solar wind energetic particles entering the magnetosphere can cause serious damage to our technological systems.\nThe MHD simulations with fixed solar wind conditions yielded many vortices along the magnetopause with only a step function in the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). Comparison of\nthese vortices with those that developed under dynamic solar wind conditions made possible the\nidentification of curious characteristics of the vortices that have\nnever been seen before. These\ncharacteristics can lead to the better understanding of the conditions under which vortices are\nmostly likely to develop, and\nhow the conditions affect vortex\nevolution.\nThese results will be presented at\nthe Fall AGU meeting in San\nFrancisco, CA, and in the 9th International School of Space Simulations at the University\nof Versailles-Saint-Quentin-enYvelines, France.\n\nA 2D visualization of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere using the results of the MHD\nsimulations with an IDL-based tool.

Recently he led a community study group providing input to the NRC Planetary Science Decadal Survey on knowledge and mission applications of space weathering\nprocesses for planetary surfaces exposed to the space environment.\nHis principal research focuses on understanding how the heliospheric and plasma magnetospheric environment of plasma and energetic-particle radiation affect the chemistry and\nstructure of planetary surfaces. This is important for interpretation of remote and in situ\nobservations of these surfaces and for design of instrumentation on present and future\nmissions to further explore these bodies.

His primary interest is in the physics of solar windmagnetosphere coupling, but he has also worked on modeling of the\nsolar corona as well as the physics of collisionless magnetic reconnection. During the last few years, he has used a combination of\nlarge-scale MHD simulations (spanning hundreds of RE) and smallscale Hall MHD simulations (spanning tens of ion inertial lengths) to\nunderstand both the global topology and local geometry of magnetic\nreconnection at Earth\xe2\x80\x99s dayside magnetopause.\n\nMore recently, Dr Dorelli has been studying the topology and generation of flux transfer\nevents (FTEs) to understand their role in triggering geomagnetic activity. In the last several months, he has become involved in analysis of the Cluster PEACE data as well as in\nmodeling the response of the Fast Plasma Instrument (FPI) Dual Electron Spectrometer\n(DES) which is being developed at GSFC as part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Magnetospheric Multiscale\nMission (MMS).\nDr Dorelli received his PhD from the University of Iowa in 1999. While at Iowa, he divided his time between developing and testing in-flight calibration algorithms for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Polar-Hydra instrument (a suite of electrostatic analyzers designed to measure\nthree-dimensional velocity distributions in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere) and modeling nonclassical electron heat flow in the solar corona.\nFor the last several years, Dr Dorelli has been actively involved in the NSF\xe2\x80\x99s Geospace\nEnvironment Modeling program, serving as a Dayside Research Area coordinator as well\nas co-organizer of the Methods and Modules Focus Group. He is currently an Associate\nEditor for the Journal of Geophysical Research.\n\nFlux rope formation appears to play a key role in generating storms on the Sun (solar flares). Recent computer simulations suggest that the same process may be occurring at Earth\xe2\x80\x99s dayside magnetopause and may\nbe responsible for triggering magnetic storms in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere.

Duvall, Jr.\nDr Duvall is an astrophysicist studying the Sun and has been doing so\nin the employ of GSFC for 30 years. His training is mainly in physics\nwith degrees from Johns Hopkins (BA) and Stanford University\n(PhD)\nHe normally works remotely from GSFC at Stanford University with\nthe instrument group that has developed the MDI instrument on SOHO and the HMI instrument for the upcoming SDO mission.\nHe served as co-chair of the NASA Sun-Earth Connection Roadmap Team in 2002 and\non the NSO User\xe2\x80\x99s Committee from 1997 to 2000. He received the NASA Exceptional\nScientific Achievement Medal in 1990. He has made five trips to Antarctica to do helioseismology research. As a reward for this onerous duty, the US Board of Geographic\nNames named Mt. Duvall at 73S22, 162E31 in 1996.\nDr Duvall is one of the pioneers of helioseismology and has been working in this\narea for 30 years. He is at least partly\nresponsible for a number of discoveries,\nincluding the relationship commonly\nknown as Duvall\'s law, the initial measurements of rotation and sound speed\nthroughout much of the solar interior,\nand the asymmetry of solar oscillation\nspectral lines. In recent years he helped\ninvent the technique known as timedistance helioseismology, in which travel times are measured between different\nsurface locations. This new technique\nhas led to interesting results, including\nthe first measurements of meridional circulation in the solar interior and the\nmeasurement of flows and sound speed\ninhomogeneities below sunspots.\nThe figure at right is from a simulation Travel time differences that would be observed from\na jet simulated at a solar interior location r/R=.71.\nof interior flows and waves, in which a\njet is inserted at 30o latitude and at radial location r/Rs = 0.71.

He is a Co-I on the radio and plasma\nwaves experiments on Wind, Ulysses, and STEREO. He has worked\nextensively on direction-finding techniques from both spinning and\nspin-stabilized spacecraft to determine the path and characteristics of\ntype III radio bursts caused by energetic packets of electrons interacting with the decreasing density of the solar wind as they move from\nthe Sun out to 1 AU and beyond. Type III bursts usually occur in\ngroups, with single isolated events found less than 5% of the time.\nThe characteristics of single bursts are usually described in terms of their rise time, their\ndrift rate, and their decay rate. Along with colleagues Dr Osherovich and Dr MacDowall,\nhe has reexamined a particularly important single event (1995 April 7) to see if the normalized amplitude-time observations at different frequencies obeyed a self-similar relation. One way of phrasing this is to ask if there is a parameter composed of time multiplied by a power of frequency such that the different observed frequencies expressed in\nthis parameter will coincide.\nThis was the case for five frequencies of the 1995 April 7 event extending from 388 to\n1040 kHz. The results are shown below with the observations in the first figure as a function of time. The second figure shows these observations after normalization (peak S = 1)\nexpressed in self-similar space; this figure demonstrates that in this self-similar space all\nfive frequencies line up in rise time, peak time, and decay rate. The red line in the second\nfigure is a four-parameter function previously used to fit single type III bursts at individual frequencies but here used to successfully fit all five frequencies simultaneously.\n\n61\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nArtem Feofilov\n\nDr Feofilov is an atmospheric physicist working at GSFC since 2005.\nCurrently he is affiliated with the Department of Physics of CUA at\nGSFC, Code 674.

He has been doing research aimed\nat better understanding fundamental processes governing the energetics, chemistry, dynamics, and transport of the mesosphere/lower thermosphere. He is also involved in work dealing with radiative transfer\nand non-LTE in planetary atmospheres.\n\nIn FY09 Dr Feofilov continued working on improving and validating the H2O non-LTE\nmodel used for interpretation of the broadband 6.6-\xc2\xb5m emission measured by the\nTIMED/SABER satellite radiometer.

Pesnell from GSFC in collaboration with Hampton University of Virginia,\nGATS, Inc., an aerospace company, Atmospheric Physics Department of the Institute for\nPhysics, St. Petersburg State University, Russia, and other institutes. The methodology\nfor model validation was developed and implemented using the overlapping in space and\ntime measurements of H2O vapor by the ACE-FTS occultation instrument. Applied to\nSABER measurements, the updated model provides the H2O VMR profiles that are consistent with other measurements and models.\nThis work has paved the way to processing an extensive SABER H2O database. The retrieved H2O profiles were used in the study performed together with S. Petelina from La\nTrobe University, Victoria, Australia, to establish the relationships between the polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) and the mesospheric area parameters (pressure, temperature,\nwater vapor concentrations) from nearly simultaneous common volume measurements\nperformed by Odin/OSIRIS and TIMED/SABER satellite instruments in both hemispheres in 2002\xe2\x80\x932008.

He\nhas flown more than 85 rockets with instrumentation designed to study\nthe middle atmosphere, thermosphere, and ionosphere to learn how\nthis region is affected by radiations and other energy sources both external and from sources closer to the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. This has produced more than 140 publications. FY09 was spent concentrating on\ninterpreting data from the SABER instrument aboard the TIMED satellite, and from the MaCWAVE Rocket Program. A major breakthrough leading to the extraction of water vapor from SABER has\nbeen made and is in press. He has worked at GSFC for more than 46 years, first for one\nyear as a NAS/NRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow, and for the balance as a NASA employee. During 1989-91, he was on leave as a National Science Foundation Program Director of the Solar-Terrestrial Program. He has a BS (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)\nand a PhD (Pennsylvania State University) in physics.\nAs the GSFC Project Scientist for the TIMED Satellite, and with his activities as a rocket\nPI for many rocket programs, Dr Goldberg has worked with numerous agencies, companies, and universities, both nationally and internationally. He has served on various review panels for NASA and other agencies, and been involved on definition teams and\nstudy groups for various planning activities. He is also an adjunct professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering at Pennsylvania State University.\nDr Goldberg is interested in the mesosphere/lower-thermosphere region (MLT) which\nhas been a difficult region to analyze and understand, largely because of the difficulty in\nmaking in situ measurements there other than with rocket soundings. Yet the MLT is a\nregion of rapid change caused by the atmospheric dynamics coupled with numerous\nsources of highly variable energy sources. Currently scientists are attempting to explain\nthe anomalously warm northern-mesopause region in the summer of 2002 and demonstrate the source for this heating to a warming of the stratosphere in the southern hemisphere using TIMED/SABER data.\nDr Goldberg is also a team member in the successful effort to develop an algorithm to\nextract mesospheric water vapor from SABER data, which is extremely important for understanding mesospheric processes and developing the climatology of the MLT. This\nyear he has produced six publications and given six presentations.\n\n67\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nMelvyn Goldstein\n\nCluster mission.\n\nA space plasma physicist, Dr Goldstein has been at GSFC since 1972,\nfirst as a National Research Council Postdoctoral Associate and, since\n1974, as a member of what is now the Geospace Science Laboratory.\nHis research focuses on a variety of nonlinear plasma processes that\ncan be elucidated using data from the four Cluster spacecraft.

CMEs and shocks are responsible for the two key space weather aspects: acceleration of solar energetic\nparticles and production of geomagnetic storms.\nWhen and where do shocks release\nenergetic particles near the Sun? This\nquestion is related to the formation of\nCME-driven shocks in the corona.\nCombining data on type II radio bursts\n(which indicate the presence of shocks\nnear the Sun) observed from ground\nand space with the white-light CME data, the particle release height is determined.\n\nIllustration of CME deflection by the strong open field\nlines in a coronal hole\n\nDr Gopalswamy discovered EUV transient reflection from a coronal hole, which confirms the wave nature of the transient. CMEs were also found to be deflected by nearby\ncoronal holes such that disk center CMEs behave like limb CMEs.\nHe has authored or co-authored 26 publications (first author in 15 of them) during FY09\nand has presented 11 invited talks.\n69\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\nJoe Gurman\n\nDr Gurman is the US project scientist for SOHO, STEREO project\nscientist, TRACE mission scientist, and SDAC facility scientist.\nDr Gurman has worked at GSFC since 1979 and for NASA since 1985.\nAB in astronomy from Harvard College, 1972, MS in physics, University of Colorado, 1974, and PhD in astrophysics, University of Colorado, 1979.\n\nIn addition to being the US project scientist for SOHO, he leads the\nlocal team that operates and disseminates the data from the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging\nTelescope (EIT) on board.

He leads the RHESSI\ntheory effort at GSFC. He is PI on a NASA Heliophysics GI grant and Co-I on another.\nHe served as Solar Flares Group Leader at the Solar Activity during the Onset of Solar\nCycle 24 Workshop in Napa, California (December 2008), and participated in the 9th\nRHESSI Workshop in Genoa, Italy (September 2009). He also served on the Popular\nWriting Award Committee of the Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical\nSociety and serves as an adviser to the Physics Today book review section. He maintains\nor helps maintain several Websites, including the RHESSI Website and the Solar Flare\nTheory Educational Website. He helped mentor an undergraduate summer student from\nTrinity College in Dublin and is advising graduate student Yang Su from Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing, China.\nDr Holman\xe2\x80\x99s research has focused primarily on the\nphysical processes that affect energetic electrons\naccelerated in solar flares and the X-ray emission\nthey subsequently radiate. He is studying how Xray images and spectra obtained with RHESSI reveal the evolution of these electrons in flares. He is\nalso studying how the evolution of these electrons\nrelates to the evolution of thermal plasma and\nmagnetic fields in flares. He is currently examining\nthe impact of nonuniform plasma ionization and\nreturn-current energy losses on flare hard X-ray\nspectra.

She contributed to detecting the implication of Cluster\xe2\x80\x99s traverse of the electron diffusion region in the\nreconnection site, from the electron distribution function showing a\nnon-gyrotropy during one spin period.\nShe analyzed and reported well-developed KH waves at the flank magnetopause during\nsouthward IMF conditions, which is unusual from the observational point of view. The\nobservation indicates that KH activities under southward IMF might have a more temporal or intermittent nature, which explains the preferential in situ detection of KH waves\nunder northward IMF conditions. Along the boundary of KH waves, evidence for the reconnection phenomenon is also found.\nCluster traverses of a series of\nKHI-generated\nstructures.\nThis observation is unusal in\nthat well-developed KH waves\nare observed under southward IMF conditions, and\nthey show temporally intermittent and irregular signatures within relatively short\ntimescales\n\nShe also investigated a series of the depolarization front passing by Cluster in the nearmidnight central current sheet. These DFs were presumably generated by bursty reconnection occurring tailward of Cluster from the observation of associated earthward fast\nflows. Each DF was followed by local magnetic disturbances that propagate mainly along\nthe -yGSM direction, indicating a magnetic fluctuation generated by the impact of the DF.\nShe will present these studies at 2009 AGU Fall meeting.\n\n73\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nSuzanne Imber\nDr Imber came to GSFC in October 2008 as part of the UMBC/GEST\nprogram having completed her MSc at Imperial College, London, in\n2005 followed by her PhD at the University of Leicester in the UK.\nShe works primarily with Dr Slavin in studying the dynamics of the\nmagnetotail at Earth but is also interested in Earth\'s field-aligned current systems and the location and rate of reconnection in the magnetosphere. Dr Imber has been a member of the Deputy Director\'s\nCouncil for Science since January 2009.\n\nThe primary focus of her research is to better understand the nature of reconnection in the\nmagnetotail using in situ magnetic field and plasma data. She has been using data primarily from the THEMIS mission, which provides unique multi-point measurements of the\nnear-Earth tail enabling the number of reconnection sites as well as the rate, the location\nand the spatial extent of the x-lines to be investigated. These data can then be combined\nwith upstream solar wind data and ground-based auroral imagery and magnetometer data\nto investigate substorm dynamics.\nShe is also interested in the region 1 and 2 field-aligned current systems at Earth, and has\nbeen investigating their spatial variability by using data from the Space Technology 5\nmission. She has also used data from this mission to study the temporal stability of theta\naurora.\n\n74\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nJack Ireland\n\nDr Ireland is a scientist working for ADNET Systems, Inc. He has\nbeen at GSFC since August 2001. He obtained both his degrees, BSc\nin mathematics and physics, and PhD in physics, from the University\nof Glasgow in Scotland.\n\nDr Ireland is PI of the Helioviewer Project, a project to develop\nWeb-based technologies for the browsing dissemination of heterogeneous solar and heliospheric data sets via intuitive interfaces. He was\nchair of LOC and SOC of the Fourth Solar Image Processing Workshop, 2008 October 26 \xe2\x80\x93 30, Baltimore, MD. He is involved in SOHO-EIT and HinodeSOT planning.\nDr Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s work in FY09 lay in four primary areas:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHe helped develop user-friendly Web interfaces for the exploration of solar datasets,\ncatalogs and science, with application to the challenge of making SDO data easily\nbrowsable.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHe applied Bayesian probability\ntechniques to the understanding of\nflare spectra from the RHESSI\nspacecraft. A Bayesian probability analysis allows one to directly\ncalculate the odds that one spectral model explains the data over\nanother, and to quote the probability that the measured value of a\nparameter lies within a given\nrange.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHe has researched the wave propagation in the solar atmosphere,\nfrom which one may deduce the\nphysical conditions of the solar\natmosphere.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nScreenshot of www.helioviewer.org, the Web-browser\nclient of the Helioviewer Project.

Dr Ireland\nalso supervised two summer students this year and undertook SOHO-EIT and HinodeSOT planning duties.

Prior to coming to Maryland she received a BS in Physics from the University of\nFlorida. She has been working with Dr Davila for the past six years.\n\nCurrently she is conducting dissertation research measuring the rotation rate of the corona by using the STEREO COR1 coronagraphs.\nPrevious measurements of rotation rates have indicated that the outer\ncorona appears to rotate much more rigidly than the photospere.\nIf true this would suggest the presence of a region of shear between materials rotating at\ndifferent rates and could have important consequences for both coronal heating and the\ninitiation of CMEs. However, no studies have definitively located such a region and\nproblems have been identified with earlier coronagraph studies of rotation rate.\nShe is attempting to measure rotation rates in the COR1 field of view, using both singleand multi-spacecraft observations. Shaela hopes to quantify the degree of influence of\nprojection effects on coronagraph rotation measurements, and to use the multi-spacecraft\ncapability to address the question of whether smaller, shorter-lived coronal features are\nrotating at a different rate than surrounding large-scale features.\n\n76\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nHyewon Jung\n\nDr Jung is a solar physicist at CUA. She joined Code 671 in January\n2009. She received her PhD degree at Seoul National University,\nSouth Korea, in 2008. Her thesis was about magnetic helicity transfer\nthrough the solar surface.\n\nShe is working with Dr Gopalswamy and his group. In this group, she\nperforms data analysis and interpretation, especially by measuring\nmagnetic helicity. She studies the links between the properties of\nCMEs (or corresponding MCs) and the properties of their source active regions. Also She is interested in studying the characteristics of CME-productive active regions. Her recent study is about the relationship between magnetic helicity and\nCME speed in source active regions.\nDr Jung studied linking the speed of CMEs to the magnetic helicity in the source active\nregions. The motivation comes from the fact that the CME speed may depend on the active-region free magnetic energy, which in turn may be represented by the helicity, a\nproxy for the nonpotentiality. After selecting a set of active regions from solar cycle 23,\nshe measured their helicity. Using EUV and magnetogram data from SOHO, she extrapolated the photospheric magnetic field to the corona to obtain the coronal helicity that fits\na EUV image before each CME eruption. The CME speeds used here correspond to the\naverage speed within the SOHO coronagraph field of view. She found that magnetic helicity is positively correlated with the speed of the CME.\n\nMagnetogram contour (MDI/SOHO) of AR 8027 superposed on the coronal EUV image (EIT/SOHO) (left), and the\nconstructed coronal magnetic structure (right) whose magnetic helicity has been calculated to be 2.54x1042 Mx2\nFrom this active region a CME occurred whose speed was 878 km/s.\n\n77\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\nJudy Karpen\n\nDr Karpen has been a research astrophysicist in the HSD Space\nWeather Laboratory since July 2008.

She is\nalso a member of the LWS TR&T Focused Science Topic team aimed at understanding\nhow flares accelerate particles near the Sun and how they contribute to large SEP events;\nher contribution is to derive estimates of velocity and magnetic fluctuations from 3D\nMHD breakout simulations that will be used as input for existing models of particle acceleration in turbulent regions above and below the flare reconnection site. Most recently,\nshe has begun to explore the effects of finite resistivity on the breakout mechanism for\nCME initiation, with 2.5D MHD modeling.\nDr Karpen is a member of the\nAAS/SPD Prize Committee.

He is interested primarily in magnetospheric substorms, but retains in interest in periodic solar wind number density structures. His current focus is to understand the dynamics\nof the auroral zone around the time of substorm onset. It has been observed for decades that auroral substorm onset begins on the equatorward edge of the nighttime aurora, which maps to the neargeosynchronous region. However, it is thought that magnetic reconnection in the midtail plasma sheet occurs prior to auroral onset, and\nthe lack of any ionospheric signature mapping to this region has been puzzling.\nThis past year Dr Kepko has studied 630.0-nm auroral emissions for a particular event\nduring the THEMIS tail season. He has found in these images a precursor to white-light\nauroral onset, which has been the traditional marker of substorm onset. This observation\nhas the potential to fill an important observational gap and further suggests that the\n630.0-nm emissions may be a sensitive indicator of plasma-sheet dynamics.\nDr Kepko is a member of the NSF Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) steering\ncommittee, a GEM Focus Group leader (Modes of Magnetospheric Transport), IAGA\n2011 Division III.2 Lead Convener (Magnetospheric Substorms and Tail Physics), and\nchair of the NASA Geospace Management Operations Working Group (G/MOWG).\n\nImages from the NORSTAR (630.0 nm) and THEMIS white-light imagers during a magnetospheric substorm.

When this form reached the equatorward edge, auroral onset commenced.\n\n79\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nGeorge Khazanov\nDr Khazanov has a PhD in physics and mathematics from the Irkutsk\nState University, Irkutsk, Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR).\nPrior to joining NASA, Khazanov was Full Tenured Professor of Physics at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

More broadly, he wants to understand\nthe magnetic fields and material in the solar atmosphere, and how it relates to the surface\nbelow and to interplanetary space above.\nThe research is done by directing the observations of ground- and space-based instruments, then intricately analyzing that data and describing the physics behind the trends\nfound in the data. Several instruments are used from observatories, including SOHO,\nSTEREO, Hinode, MLSO, and BBSO. From the past year, we have found that the prominence\xe2\x80\x99s mass and composition changes in relation to activity level and in the build-up to\nprominence eruptions and CMEs.\n\nExample of an eruption on 2003 June 11\n\n81\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nJoe King\n\nDr King supports efforts in heliospheric data accessibility and related\ninformation management.\n\nHe joined GSFC in February 1967 as an NAS/NRC Postdoc in the\nLaboratory for Theoretical Physics.

In 2009, they extended the parameter set in, and the time span of the High\nResolution OMNI data set, we extended the functionality of the interfaces to this and to\nrelated data sets, and created a new interface, called OMNIWeb-Plus, that integrates over\nmultiple, pre-existing interfaces.\nYoji Kondo\n\nDr Kondo is Co-I of the Kepler Mission and is involved in the pipeline processing of the light from some one hundred thousand stars\nwithin the Kepler field.\n\nThe Kepler Mission was launched on March 6 and is performing nominally. According to the current understanding of the planetary formation, we expect to find about 60 Earth-like stars within the habitable zones of the G-type mother stars by the end of the 4-year mission.\nThe Kepler field covers some 100 square degrees of the sky in a region of Cygnus. The detection is based on observing the planetary transits; since the transit must be repeated at least twice to evaluate the distance of the planet from the mother\nstar, the mission period must necessarily cover two or more transits. Planetary detections\nthus far have been based largely on observing the perturbations on the primary star due to\nthe orbital motions of the companion planets, hence it tends to favor detections of massive planets \xe2\x80\x93 i.e., Jupiter-sized or super-Jupiter-sized planets \xe2\x80\x93 orbiting near the primary.\n\n82\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nJim Klimchuk\n\nDr Klimchuk has been an astrophysicist in the Solar Physics Lab at\nGSFC for 2 years, after having spent 14 years at the Naval Research\nLab and 7 years at Stanford University before that.

During 2009, he was President of IAU Commission 10\n(Solar Activity) and Vice-President of Division 2 (Sun and Heliosphere). He was a member of the AAS Solar Physics Division Committee, after having completed terms as Chair\nand Vice-Chair. He served on the AAS Committee on Astronomy and Public Policy, the\nEditorial Board of the journal Solar Physics, the Solar-C Science Definition Team, and\nthe GSFC Deputy Director\xe2\x80\x99s Council on Science. He also led the NASA LWS Focus\nTeam on Solar Origins of Irradiance Variation. Dr Klimchuk is an honorary fellow of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society.\nDr Klimchuk\xe2\x80\x99s research during 2009 was mostly concerned with the heating and thermal\nstructure of the solar corona, especially coronal loops. He used a combination of observations and numerical simulations to infer the fundamental properties of the heating. An\nimportant breakthrough was the detection of extremely hot (> 4 MK) plasma during times\nwhen the Sun was not flaring. The very faint emission is widespread in active regions and\nis the strongest evidence yet that the corona is heated by a myriad of tiny impulsive energy bursts called nanoflares. Dr Klimchuk used MHD simulations to show that the nanoflares are not due to classical turbulence, as many people had proposed, but instead are\nlikely to be caused by the\nsecondary instability of\nelectric current sheets. He\ndiscussed his results in 5\ninvited and 6 contributed\npresentations\nover\nthe\ncourse of the year, including a keynote address at the\nHinode II meeting.

He received a PhD at Charles University in Prague (Czech\nRepublic) in 2006 and BSc and MSc at Sumy State University\n(Ukraine) in 2000 and 2001.\nHis main scientific interests are:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProperties of shock waves in the solar wind and magnetosheath.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDevelopment of an improved technique for shock parameter determination from single-spacecraft measurements by taking into account measurements of temperature\nanisotropy and alpha-particle parameters and by simultaneous determination of shock\nnormal direction and propagation speed.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEstimation of shock global shapes from multi-spacecraft observations to find deviation from the widely used planar assumption.\n\nBased on the introduced new approaches to the shock parameter determination, a program with a graphical user interface was created using Interactive Data Language. The\nprogram serves for fast determination of shock parameters and allows user to investigate\nand compare different methods and approaches in order to determine shock parameters\nmore accurately. It supports measurements of several currently available spacecraft and\nprovides a simple method for adding a new spacecraft.\nDr Koval developed an improved calibration technique for the Wind spacecraft Magnetic\nField Investigation to allow the production of 1122 vector/s high-time-resolution data. In\nthe current stage, the improved technique results in significantly decreased spin noise in\nthe data as compared to the original calibration technique.\n\n84\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nMaxim Kramar\n\nThe pre- and post-CME coronal electron density structure has been\nstudied and compared it with the potential field source surface (PFSS)\nmodels for the corresponded periods. Two CME cases belonging to\ndifferent types have been considered. One case consists of a slow\nCME on 2008 June 1, probably originated relatively high in the corona, and the second case consists of two fast CMEs on 2007 December\n31 and 2008 January 2 having source regions close to the Sun\'s surface\nin the same active region. The reconstructions of the coronal electron\ndensity in the range from 1.5 to 4 Rs were performed using a tomography technique based on COR1/STEREO data.\nFor the first case of slow CME, it was found that:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe potential magnetic field configuration in the CME initiation region before the\nCME does not agree with the coronal density structure while after the CME the\nagreement between the field and density is much better. This could be manifestation\nof that that the field was non-potential before the CME and after the CME the field\nrelaxes towards a more potential state.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe dimming caused by the slow CME is not due to rotation of the corona and a lineof-sight (LOS) effect but a streamer blowout effect took place.\n\n85\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nTherese A.

In the ionosphere,\nRegion 1 (R1) and Region 2 (R2) FACs are closed by Pederson currents flow between the ionospheric footprints of R1 and R2 FACs. The unbalanced portion of R1 and R2 currents are closed by cross-polar cap\nPederson currents. Hall currents are not part of the closure currents for FACs. Also known as auroral\nelectrojets in the auroral zone, they close in the ionosphere by flowing sunward over the polar cap to form\ncurrent loops. ST5, a constellation of three micro-satellites, provides first multi-point magnetic field measurements of field-aligned currents at low-altitudes.

His BSc is from Imperial College, London, and\nhis PhD is from the University of Delaware. Although he is in the Solar Physics Laboratory (Code 671.1), his research interests extend further (both literally and metaphorically) than just the Sun.\n\nHe works primarily in data analysis and observation; the overarching\ntheme of his post-dissertation research career to date has been the correlation of interplanetary phenomena with their solar sources. This is\ntrue on both large scales with CMEs and their interplanetary manifestations, and the\nsmall-scale tracking and forecasting of the quiet solar wind.\nMuch of his work in the past year has been on applications of MRoI. This is a simple realization of the magnetic environment and reflects the radial distance required to balance\nthe magnetic field contained in any pixel in a magnetogram. While it contains no directional information, it can be thought of as a measure of magnetic partitioning of the plasma into open and closed regions. When the MRoI is small, the magnetic field is \xe2\x80\x9cclosed\xe2\x80\x9d\nlocally, while if the MRoI is large, the magnetic field at the center is largely unbalanced\nand the magnetic environment is effectively \xe2\x80\x9copen.\xe2\x80\x9d High MRoI can result from either a\nflux concentration (e.g., an active region), or from a large predominantly unipolar region\n(e.g., a coronal hole). It has implications on small scales (e.g., blue shifted flows as observed at Transition Region heights by SUMER), and also on the largest scales, as in\nwhere the source of Earth-Directed solar wind.\n\nMRoI map for synoptic maps for Carrington Rotations 1955-6 (half of each), showing the motion of the footpoint of earth-directed solar wind does not progress smoothly across the photosphere \xe2\x80\x93 rather, it jumps from\none patch of (relatively) high MRoI to the next. When there is no close region of high MRoI, the foot-point\nstays put for several days, but when there is no real dominant patch, the foot-point moves rapidly. The time\nthat the footpoint jumps into the yellow coronal hole contour matches the start of fast wind observed in situ.\n\n90\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nAlexander S.

He also received a\nPhD in theoretical and mathematical physics (1988) from Space Research Institute (IKI) Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), and the\ntitle "Professor of Space Physics" from the Russian Ministry for Higher Education (1995). He worked in IKI RAS from 1972 as Scientist,\nSenior Scientist, Lead Scientist/Professor and after Jan. 1997 in the Dialogue-Science,\nA.A. Dorodnitsyn Computing Center RAS as a Lead Scientist/Professor. From 1973 he\nalso occupied the Assistant, Dozent, Deputy Head of Basic Speciality (Chair) "Space\nPhysics" (including Space Physics, Astrophysics and Computational Physics), and Professor positions in the Dept. of Problems of Physics and Energetics, Moscow Institute for\nPhysics and Technology.

The results of these simulations will serve as an expert system\nfor SP+ spacecraft design, for a future mission to Europa and for an interpretation of the\nCAPS data during the Cassini mission near Titan.\n\nExample of fluxes of\n\n+\nSO ++ (left) and O2 (right) ions at the surface of Europa\n\n91\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nPeter MacNeice\n\nDr MacNeice works on the development and application of solar and\nheliospheric models, for both research and forecasting applications.\nHe has been studying the accuracy of the models of the coronal and\nheliospheric magnetic fields and plasma, which are run at the CCMC\nand developing specific tests for their validation. He is also leading an\neffort to develop a 3D model for the slow quasi-static evolution of solar active region fields. This effort encompasses potential, nonlinear\nforce-free and MHD codes with adaptive mesh refinement. It will also\ninclude a utility for synthesizing time series of magnetograms for use\nby the models. This suite of models is being developed for use by the research community as an LWS strategic capability. The magnetogram synthesis work is also supported by\nAISRP.

He has been working at GSFC since January 2007. He\nobtained his MSc in physics and PhD in space physics at the University of Turku, Finland. In Finland, he worked at the Space Research Laboratory in the Department of Physics, where he was involved mainly\nin the data analysis of the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron instrument on SOHO.\n\nHe helps with the CDAW Data Center (http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov) that\nmaintains the extensively used SOHO/LASCO CME list and also other CME related data\nsets.\nWhile working here at GSFC with Dr Gopalswamy and the other members of his group,\nDr M\xc3\xa4kel\xc3\xa4 has been able not only to further his experience on SEPs but also to extend it\ninto optical and radio observations of the associated solar events. His main field of research concerns particle acceleration at the Sun. He is therefore working mostly on the\nanalysis of SEP and CME observations by both spaceborne and ground-based instruments. As energetic particles and CMEs transport the effects of solar activity to Earth, the\nsubject of his research is important in the field of space weather, even though he is not\nstudying the effects of space weather itself.\nIn 2009, Dr M\xc3\xa4kel\xc3\xa4 research concerned particle acceleration during\nCME-driven radio-quiet (RQ)\nshocks. The RQ shocks are defined as interplanetary (IP) shocks\nthat are associated with CMEs\nwithout observed type II radio\nburst in the metric or decameterhectometric wavelength range,\ni.e., no coronal shock. The study is\nbased on the observations by SOHO, Wind, and ACE spacecraft\nand ground-based radio observatories, and it extends the previous Radio emission (left) and particle flux (right) associated\nstudies of the group on RQ shocks with the 5 October 2000 radio-quiet shock.\nand CMEs. Results indicate that shock acceleration efficiency of electrons and ions in the\nsolar corona and IP space are not strictly correlated. IP shocks can accelerate particles,\nbut less efficiently, even though they do not produce observable type II radio bursts, as\nevidenced by the Figure showing the lack of type II radio burst in the observations of the\n03:50 UT 2 October 2000 CME by the Learmonth radio observatory and Wind/WAVES\nand the associated proton and electron enhancement observed by the ACE/EPAM instrument during the passage of the 2000 October 5 RQ shock (dotted vertical line).\n\n93\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nLeila Mays\n\nLeila Mays began at GSFC in August 2009 as a NASA Postdoctoral\nProgram (NPP) Fellow working with Dr St. Cyr and Dr Sibeck.

As an undergrad he attended CMU.\nFor RHESSI his work centers around making certain that the software models the real\ninstrument as closely as possible and that the scientists using the data can work in an efficient and intuitive fashion. While much of his work appears to be coding, he is still intensely interested in the detector physics, the details of the instrument/telemetry interface,\nand the nature of the energetic particles we observe from the Sun\nSome of the other instruments that he has helped bring to the community from the past,\npresent and future: SMM/HXRBS, GRS, Yohkoh/HXT, NEAR PIN, MESSENGER PIN,\nCGRO/BATSE, FERMI/LAT, GBM, KORONAS/SPHINX and RHESSI.\nHe continues to be interested in future missions and is hoping to assist at some level with\nthe focusing optics X-ray systems and the advanced \xce\xb3-ray imaging spectrometers.\nThe most visible work this past year was the capture of a 3-year FERMI award to bring\nthe solar data to the community.

He started the\nNASA Postdoctoral Program in August 2009. He completed his major in electrical engineering and minor in physics at the Middle East\nTechnical University in Ankara, Turkey, in 2003. He obtained his MS\nand PhD degrees in electrical engineering from PSU in 2006 and\n2009, respectively.\n\nDr Seker is responsible for the PSU All-sky Imager at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Currently, he is collaborating with researchers at the Pennsylvania State University and Cornell University.\nDr Seker is working with Dr Fung on the irregularities in the night-time mid-latitude Fregion of the ionosphere. His current focus is on the relationship between the geomagnetic state parameters and the occurrence of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDS) and spread-F plumes which are found to occur during low and high\ngeomagnetic activity, respectively. For this study, he uses the PSU All-sky Imager data\nand the geomagnetic state parameters obtained from the Magnetospheric State Query\nSystem (MSQS) created by Dr Fung. The results will be useful for determining the conditions under which these irregularities, which adversely affect satellite communications,\nare triggered, which is currently unknown and is important as it might help forecast these\nevents.\n\nTwo all-sky images from Arecibo Observatory showing an equatorial spread-F plume (left panel) reaching\nmid-latitudes during a geomagnetic storm and MSTIDS bands (right panel) that usually occur when the\ngeomagnetic activity is low.\n\n117\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nAlbert Shih\n\nDr Shih is a NASA Postdoctoral Program fellow who started work at\nGSFC in September 2009. He has a BS in physics and mathematics\nfrom the California Institute of Technology and a PhD in physics from\nthe University of California, Berkeley.\n\nHe studies the acceleration of ions by solar flares using observable\nsignatures, primarily \xce\xb3 rays. Large amounts of stored magnetic energy\ncan be transiently released in flares, and a significant fraction of this\nenergy (tens of percent) goes into energetic electrons and ions. Understanding how solar flares efficiently accelerate particles to high energies improves our\nunderstanding of related energy-release processes occurring throughout the universe.\nThe main observable signature of accelerated ions is \xce\xb3-ray line emission, and Dr Shih\nanalyzes data collected by RHESSI. RHESSI observations show that ions and electrons\nare roughly proportionally accelerated in flares above certain energies, which suggests a\ncommon acceleration mechanism. Also, the temporal variability of \xce\xb3-ray lines can be\nused to probe changes in ambient abundances as a flare progresses.\nDr Shih is a Co-I on the NASA Low-Cost-Access-to-Space balloon mission called the\nGamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS). GRIPS is being developed and\nbuilt primarily at the University of California, Berkeley, and will use \xce\xb3-ray observations\nto address unanswered questions about particle acceleration in flares. GRIPS combines a\nnew germanium detector technology with a\nnovel \xce\xb3 -ray imaging design to provide a nearoptimal combination of high-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of photons\nfrom ~20 keV to >~10 MeV, with an unparalleled \xce\xb3 -ray angular resolution of 12.5 arcseconds. In addition to the direct science return\nfrom balloon flights, the technologies on\nGRIPS will be proven for future space-based\ninstruments.\nHe is also actively participates in designing\nand developing future solar instruments to\nstudy ion acceleration. Advancements can be\nmade in observing \xce\xb3\xe2\x88\x92rays, and accelerated\nions can also produce ENAs which can provide a new window into ion acceleration.\n\n118\n\nThe correlation between ion-associated and\nelectron-associated emissions indicates that\n>0.3 MeV electrons and >30 MeV protons\nare proportionally accelerated in solar flares\nover >3 orders of magnitude in fluence.\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nDave Sibeck\n\nDr Sibeck is a magnetospheric physicist in the Space Weather Laboratory (Code 674) at GSFC.

Sittler, Jr.\nDr Sittler is an astrophysicist in Code 673. He continues a broad spectrum of interests including heliospheric physics, planetary magnetospheres, and astrobiology. He received a BS degree in Physics (magna\ncum laude) at Hofstra University in 1972 and PhD in Physics at MIT\nin 1978. He served on several NASA review panels, and the TSSM\nscience definition panel. He was a member of the SP+ panel but that\nhas been disbanded in preparation for its AO.\nHe is (1) a Co-I on the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) team; (2)\nPI on two Cassini Data Analysis Program (CDAP)-funded efforts to analyze CAPS plasma data within Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s inner magnetosphere and its moon Enceladus and to analyze\nCAPS plasma data at Titan within the context of a hybrid model of Titan\xe2\x80\x99s interaction\nwith Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere; (3) PI of an LWS TR&T funded effort to develop a semiempirical MHD model of the solar corona and solar wind; (4) PI on a funded instrument\ndevelopment effort under the astrobiology instrument development (ASTID) program to\nbuild a 3D ion mass spectrometer (IMS) and 3D Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS)\nfor a mission to Europa, in collaboration with Code 699, headed by Paul Mahaffy; (5) PI\non mid-term IRAD to develop a high precision electric gate (HPEG) for the ASTID developed IMS & INMS; (6) PI on mid-term IRAD to build for the in situ suite of plasma\ninstruments for SP+ with a nadir viewing capability (in collaboration with Lockheed\nMartin); (7) PI of two IRADs that have been selected for FY10 with the first to develop a\nradiation hardened version of the ASTID IMS and INMS for Europa and the other to further develop the HPEG and build miniature IMS. He has also submitted numerous invention disclosures to GSFC\xe2\x80\x99s patent office this past year for which GSFC is in the process\nof patenting his HPEG design. The HPEG has the potential of providing mass resolution\nM/\xe2\x88\x86M > 1000 and with time-of-flight reflectometer M/\xe2\x88\x86M > 10,000. In addition to the\nabove he has written a chapter in the Titan Cassini-Huygens books on energy Deposition\ninto Titan\xe2\x80\x99s upper atmosphere and Titan\xe2\x80\x99s induced magnetosphere. He has written two\npapers on Titan to Planetary and Space Science selected for publication with one of the\ntwo presenting evidence for exobiology at Titan. He has been at GSFC since 1978.\nHis main research questions are: 1) what mechanisms drive the solar wind, 2) what are\nthe physics of Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere and its interaction with Titan and Enceladus, and\n3) what is the astrobiological potential of Titan, Enceladus, and Europa. The nature of the\nmechanisms driving the solar wind has been a long unsolved problem since its prediction\nby Parker. Saturn is a fast-rotating planet which has turned out to be more dynamic than\noriginally thought, with its interaction with Titan and Enceladus of intense scientific interest. Titan, Enceladus, and Europa are observationally thought to have subsurface\noceans, with Titan being of special interest due to observed organic chemistry in its ionosphere and the ethane/methane lakes on its surface.\n\n121\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nJames Slavin\nDr Slavin is the Director of HSD. Space science research and flight\nmissions have been a central focus for him since he joined his first instrument team, the Pioneer Venus magnetic field investigation, in\n1978. He thoroughly enjoys not only the opportunity to make new discoveries and advance scientific understanding, but also the sense of\ncommunity and spirit of team work that pervades space science. However, he also treasures his time with family and friends, enjoy playing\ntennis and jogging, and spend more time than he should reading\nscience fiction and mysteries. He was hired by GSFC in 1987 to take\nover the Dynamics Explorer magnetic fields investigation. All told he has been a Project\nScientist and/or Science Investigator on 20 space flight missions, a few of which were\ncancelled or failed, but most of which were highly successful and wonderful experiences.\nThe vast majority of his time is spent supporting HSD and its highly accomplished and\nalways engaging staff who serve as secretaries, managers, resource analysts, scientists,\ntechnicians, engineers, system administrators, and many other important functions. Our\nDivision leads ~20 flight missions and instrument activities with a broad range of science\ngoals. He mentors two post-doctoral scientists, two NASA Graduate Student Research\nProgram and one Co-operative Program graduate students. He also serves on the NASA\nAdvisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Planetary Science Subcommittee.\nHis research time is limited,\nbut spans a range of topics\nall relating to magnetic reconnection and the solar\nwind interaction with the\nplanets. The most significant\nscientific result for the previous year was the first direct measurements of reconnection at Mercury\xe2\x80\x99s magnetopause.\n\nMESSENGER magnetic field observations from MESSENGER\xe2\x80\x99s\nsecond flyby of the dawn flank magnetopause and a giant flux transfer event (FTE) are shown. Analysis of these measurements has led\nto the conclusion that reconnection at Mercury proceeds at a rate\n10 times that at Earth.\n\n122\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nKeith Strong\n\nDr Strong is solar physicist who has worked in the areas of X-ray\nspectroscopy of active regions and flares, coronal abundance variability, coronal dynamics, and, most recently, solar cycle characterization\nand prediction. He received his BSc from University College London\nin 1971 and his PhD from the Mullard Space Science Laboratory,\nUniversity of London, in 1979. He worked at the Lockheed Martin\nAdvanced Technology Center for 34 years initially as a research assistant and eventually as the senior manager of the Space Science departments before retiring in 2007. He joined the GSFC solar group as\na part-time scientist to get back to analyzing solar data, which is his first love.\nHe is particularly interested in E/PO activities. He has given two public lectures this year:\none to a standing-room only crowd on the solar cycle, organized by a local astronomy\nclub and the other on the potential link between solar variability and climate change, at\nthe Sir Patrick Moore Planetarium.\nDrs Saba and Strong have been working on the analysis and interpretation of solar magnetic data (mainly from SOHO MDI and NSO) and comparing it to coronal activity (data\nfrom Yohkoh, SOHO, and GOES). They are currently looking at asymmetries between\nthe timing and amplitude of flux emergence in the northern and southern hemispheres as\nwell as trying to identify active longitudes. They have given several presentations at various meetings on this subject in FY09.\n\nWe have dubbed this the Tree Trunk plot. It shows the longitudinal distribution of magnetic flux for each\nCarrington rotation of the Sun over the last 30 years (so is the longitudinal equivalent of the butterfly diagram). Time goes from right to left on the abscissa, and solar longitude is plotted on the ordinate. Active\nlongitudes should show up as a steeply positive or negative gradient in the plot and change systematically\nthroughout the cycle as the mean latitude of the emerging active regions reduces as the cycle progresses.\nWe find no strong evidence of any active longitudes for the last three cycles.

He came to GSFC at the end of 2002 as an NRC research associate. Prior to this, he had been at Imperial College, London, where\nhe completed both his PhD in space physics and his undergraduate\nMSc in physics. He has recently joined the Solar System Exploration\nDivision (Code 695).\n\nDr Stubbs is a participating scientist with the Lunar Reconnaissance\nOrbiter (LRO) mission and affiliated with the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of\nRadiation (CRaTER) instrument team. He is also affiliated with the NASA Lunar Science\nInstitute (NLSI) as a Co-I with the Dynamic Response of the Environment At the Moon\n(DREAM) team. He has recently served on the following advisory panels: Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Advisory Group, LADTAG (2005\xe2\x80\x93present); NAC Heliophysics Lunar Subpanel (2006\xe2\x80\x932008); and Deputy Director\xe2\x80\x99s Council on Science, DDCS (2007\xe2\x80\x93\npresent). Tim regularly reviews journal articles and proposals for NASA, NSF, and international research programs.\nDr Stubbs\xe2\x80\x99 main research interest is the dynamic lunar environment and how its various\ncomponents interact with each other (see figure). In particular, he has studied lunar surface charging and the electrostatic transport of charged lunar dust. He is using LRO data\nto model lunar surface electric fields and search for evidence of exospheric dust. Understanding the fundamental processes of\nthe interaction of airless bodies, such as\nthe Moon, with the\nsurrounding\nspace\nenvironment is vital\nfor\nunderstanding\nboth their surface\nevolution and the potential hazards that\nmay be faced by future explorers. He has\npreviously studied the\ninjection, energization, and transport of\nplasma in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nmagnetosphere and An overview of the dynamic lunar environment, showing how the wellauroral dynamics.\nknown planetary processes (examples listed at the bottom) couple with\nexternal drivers (listed at the top) to produce the various interdependent\ncomponents of the lunar environment [Credit NLSI/DREAM].\n\n124\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nErrol Summerlin\n\nDr Summerlin began his secondary education at the Georgia Institute\nof Technology, where he received a BS in physics in 2002. After that\nhe attended Rice University, where he worked under Dr Matthew Baring. His thesis was comprised of results from a Monte-Carlo simulation of first-order Fermi shock acceleration in both heliospheric and\nastrophysical environments. He wrote this simulation during his tenure\nat Rice starting from a blank \xe2\x80\x98.c\xe2\x80\x99 file. He received his MS there in\n2006 and completed all the requirements for his PhD shortly before\ncoming to GSFC. He began work at GSFC in July 2009. His first task\nis to be, essentially, the omega user for VEPO. Since he is an expert in energetic particles, but has no experience in data analysis or instrumentation, he is exactly the type of\nscientist that will typically be using VEPO. In using this data for comparison with his simulation, he will be able to provide feedback on how the VEPO documentation can be\nimproved. In the process of understanding these data sets, he also essentially acts as a\nquality assurance officer for the data set that he is working with (Ulysses HI-SCALE)\nensuring that the documentation on VEPO reflects the caveats and nuances of the data set\nas accurately as possible. In this capacity, he discovered a flaw in the Compton-Getting\ntransformation that was performed 10 years ago and is currently working with the data\nprovider to correct the affected data set.\nHis primary research interests are in the field of shock acceleration physics. Shocks are\nexpected to be the dominant source of energetic particles in the universe. The process is\nubiquitous and powerful. Understanding of this process is a critical but often overlooked\npart of space weather\xe2\x80\x99s predictive capabilities. Many of the largest energetic-particle\nevents observed at Earth are the result of shock acceleration as the shock travels through\nthe interplanetary medium. Understanding this process outside the heliosphere provides\nnew meaning to observed spectral distributions. With some understanding of the emission\nprocess in these distant plasmas, one can infer a particle distribution in these objects.\nThen, with understanding of the acceleration process, one can infer the physical parameters necessary to produce the inferred particle distribution, providing new information\nabout the object in question that cannot be discovered observationally with current technology. Dr Summerlin has been involved in several publications in both contexts.\n\n125\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nAdam Szabo\n\nDr Szabo is the Chief of the Heliospheric Physics Laboratory, Code\n672.

He received his MS and PhD degrees\nfrom the St.-Petersburg State University in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nThe main topic of Dr Usmanov\xe2\x80\x99s research is understanding and quantitatively modeling the evolution of the solar wind on a global scale,\nfrom the coronal base to the boundary of the heliosphere. The focus of\nDr Usmanov\xe2\x80\x99s work over the last year was the development of a global\n3D solar wind model that is based on numerical solutions of largescale Reynolds-averaged magnetohydrodynamic equations coupled with a set of subgridscale equations for turbulence transport and dissipation.\n\nContour plots in the meridional plane of the solar wind parameters: radial velocity, density, temperature, and turbulent energy from 0.3 to10 AU (a-d) and from 10 to 100 AU (e-h). A dipole source field\non the Sun is tilted by 30 degrees.\n\nThe model was used to study (a) properties of the large-scale solar wind, interplanetary\nmagnetic field, and turbulence throughout the heliosphere; (b) the effects of pickup protons in the physical processes of the outer heliosphere; (c) the interaction between the\nlarge-scale solar wind and smaller-scale turbulence; and (d) the role of the turbulence in\nthe large scale heliospheric structure and temperature distribution in the solar wind. Dr\nUsmanov has given scientific presentations at the Solar Wind 12 Conference in St. Malo\nand at the Mini Symposium on Solar Wind, Brussels.\n\n130\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nAdolfo Vi\xc3\xb1as\n\nDr Vi\xc3\xb1as is a space plasma physicist with HSD. He has also served as a\nresearch scientist at other GSFC\xe2\x80\x99s divisions since 1980. He is a Co-I on\nthe Wind/SWE and Cluster/PEACE plasma electron experiments, and\ncurrently is a Co-I with the Fast-Plasma Investigation of the Magnetospheric Multiscale Satellites (MMS) mission. Dr Vi\xc3\xb1as\xe2\x80\x99 research interests include the study of kinetic and MHD processes, plasma instabilities, kinetic turbulence, and shocks and discontinuities in the solar corona, solar wind, and magnetosphere. He is currently involved in the\nsimulation and testing of new analysis techniques for the Fast Plasma\nInvestigation of the MMS mission.\nDr Vi\xc3\xb1as developed a method to describe the geometrical and physical properties of\nshocks and disturbances based on the conservation of physical conditions. It has been implemented in a visualization and analysis tool named SDAT. Recently, he has developed\na new model independent spherical harmonic spectral method for the calculation and\nmodeling of particle velocity distribution functions (VDFs) and the estimation of its moments and anisotropies for fast and high-angular-energy-resolution plasma spectrometers.\nHe is currently supervising a doctoral student/fellow from Brazil.\nHis most recent work uses Cluster/PEACE electron measurements to examine the properties and characteristics of non-thermal three-dimensional velocity distributions of the\nstrahl electrons in the solar wind. An example of such non-thermal distributions, in a\nframe relative to the local magnetic field, in the upstream solar wind region.\n\n131\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nTongjiang Wang\n\nDr Wang, solar physicist, has been a research associate at CUA and\nworking at GSFC, Code 671 since 2007.\nThe objective of his research is to understand dynamics and heating\nof the solar corona based on observations of various wave phenomena\nin coronal loops. These waves carry the signature of the emitting\nsource and can diagnose the physical parameters of highly structured\ncoronal loops. He has been also working on radiometric calibration of\nEUNIS.\n\nIn 2009, Dr Wang and his\ncoauthors detected two longperiod (12 and 25 min) harmonic waves propagating\nalong fanlike coronal loops\nwith observations from the\nEUV Imaging Spectrometer\n(EIS) onboard Hinode. It is\nthe first time that such kinds\nof waves have been simultaneously detected in both intensity and Doppler shift in a\ncoronal emission line, Fe XII.\nTheir amplitude relationship\nprovides convincing evidence\nthat these propagating features are a manifestation of\nslow magnetoacoustic waves.\nDr Wang proposed a new\napplication of coronal seis- The 12 and 25 min upwardly-propagating slow magnetoacoustic\nmology based on this obser- waves in coronal loops observed by the EUV Imaging Spectromevation, which derived the ter (EIS) onboard Hinode..\ntrue sound speed and temperature near the loop\'s footpoint. This work was presented as a talk at the SPD meeting in\nBoulder, Colorado. In addition, Dr Wang has been working on underflight radiometric\ncalibration of Hinode/EIS using EUNIS-07.\n\n132\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nYongli Wang\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDr Wang is a research faculty of UMBC/GEST and is stationed at\nGSFC. He received a PhD in Geophysics and Space Physics from\nUniversity of California Los Angeles in 2003. He joined GSFC in\nJanuary 2006, working on satellite data calibration, support (i.e.,\nSpace Technology 5), as well as NASA and NSF projects in various\ntopics covering the ionosphere, the inner and exterior magnetosphere,\nthe magnetopause and magnetosheath, and the Moon.\n\nCurrently Dr Wang is the PI of two NASA grants:\nAutomating electron density determinations from magnetospheric dynamic spectra\nGeneralized 3D magnetosheath specification model.\n\nHe is also a Co-Investigator of four NASA and NSF grants:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Characterizing the composition of large mid-latitude topside-ionosphericplasmaspheric gradients\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Characteristics of flux transfer events\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Establishing Links between Solar Wind and Topside Ionospheric Parameters\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Magnetospheric electron density\nMeanwhile, Dr Wang is working closely with Dr Timothy J.

He has been a regular reviewer\nfor NASA and NSF proposals, as well as scientific journals including J. Geophys. Res.,\nGeophys. Res. Lett., Adv. Space Res., Annales Geophysicae, and J. of Atmos. and SolarTerr. Phys.\nCurrently he is working on modeling of 3D magnetopause/bow shock/magnetosheath and their dependence on solar wind and geophysical conditions; building the largest flux transfer event database for its generation and dynamics; studying\nmultiple spacecraft dynamic spectrum and ionosonde observations for magnetosphere- ionosphere\ndensity; and building the lunar plasma shadow and\nsurface charging model to understand the lunar\nenvironment. All this work uses the best observations/modeling techniques available to help better\nunderstand the Earth\'s ionosphere-magnetosphere\nsystem and the Moon.\n\n133\n\nAn example of auto fitting of 5 years of\nIMAGE power spectrum with Z-mode\ncorrection to obtain electron density.\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nPeter Williams\n\nDr Williams is a second-year NPP and has continued his work with Dr\nPesnell analyzing Doppler velocity images from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) aboard SOHO. These images can be reduced to extract surface manifestations of internal convection mechanisms, seen\nas either granule or supergranule cells. Supergranules are significant in\nsuch studies as there is clear evidence of magnetic field interactions\nwithin, and at the boundaries of, such cells. The past year has involved\nstudying various characteristics of these features, such as their sizes,\nlifetimes and advection properties; and then comparing our results between the past two minima, using MDI data from 1996 and 2008. Although the supergranule lifetimes tend to be similar for both years, we find that supergranules are smaller and\ntheir flows stronger in 2008 than in 1996.\n\nDoppler velocity images (upper left), that illustrate surface flows toward (blue) and away (red) the observer at\nthe surface of the Sun, are reduced to display only those flows due to surface convection features. A spectrum of\nconvection cell sizes can be derived (lower left), showing a peak corresponding to supergranules. The results\nshow typical sizes of around 35 Mm. Correlation techniques can be applied to pairs of images to estimate the\ntypical lifetime of supergranules (upper right). The derived 1/e lifetime is around 18 hours. The velocity patterns\nmay be decomposed into radial and horizontal components (lower right). Horizontal flows are normally a whole\nmagnitude stronger than radial flows.\n\n134\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nCharles Wolff\nDr Wolff is a member of the Solar Physics Branch. His research aims to explain why the\nSun\xe2\x80\x99s neutrino flux and luminous output at all wavelengths is not constant. He seeks answers deep inside the Sun, which supplements the many other efforts that study detailed\nbehavior at the surface. He received his PhD in physics from the University of Illinois.\nHe has been at GSFC for decades and, in recent years, served on several NSF proposal\nreview panels.\nHe predicted that g-modes (with periods of hours) should couple to form rigidly rotating,\noscillating structures like the one in the accompanying figure. Each structure rotates\nslowly at a different rate, following well-established asymptotic theory. When the highpower regions of several structures overlap (periodically on timescales of months or\nyears), they cause extranuclear burning in the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s core causing more neutrino flux. At\nabout the same time the overlap region feeds extra energy into the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s convective\nenvelope, which can excite a large-scale upflow that will soon cause more solar activity\nat the surface. This would explain previously puzzling reports that solar activity levels\ncorrelate somewhat with changes in neutrino flux.\nWolff has found observational evidence for the g-modes or their structures by two independent methods. The most recent detection is in a paper. It also contains observational\nand theoretical reasons why conventional solar structure models are deficient and need to\nadd a rapidly mixed shell about one sixth of the way from center to surface.\nTemperature fluctuations caused inside\nthe Sun by a set of coupled g-mode\noscillations are concentrated in angle\n(red surface) and at two points along\nthe prime radius (yellow). This pattern\nof oscillatory power is sustained by\nnuclear burning at the inner peak and\nit dE/POsits energy mainly at the outer\npeak, stimulating convection in the\nSun\xe2\x80\x99s envelope.\n\n135\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nHong Xie\n\nDr Xie, a solar physicist with CUA, joined Code 671 in April 2003.\nShe has been working on data analysis of CMEs, CME-driven shocks,\nand associated geomagnetic storms. She is currently maintaining the\nSTEREO COR1 preliminary CME catalog. Her research interests include the origin, 3D structure, and evolution of CMEs. She has developed new analytical CME cone model fitting procedure, and incorporated a geometrical flux-rope model fitting for STEREO/COR coronagraph images.\n\nIn 2009, working with STEREO team, Dr St. Cyr and Dr Gopalswamy, she has studied\nthe origin, 3D structure, and kinematic evolution of CMEs near solar minimum using the\nSTEREO COR1 and COR2 data, flux-rope models, and 3D triangulations. She also improved the shock prediction technique based on the empirical shock arrival (ESA) model,\nwhere CME deceleration is included in the corrected ESA and synthesized with kilometric Type II-derived shock velocities.\nIn addition, working with Dr Holly Gilbert, she investigated the relationship between the\nnature of a prominence eruption including total, partial, failed eruption, the amount of\nmass loss (draining) occurring prior to and/or during an eruption, and the associated CME\nproperties such as speed, mass, and energy.\nFirst direct observations of the X-line structures\n(a well-known location of current sheets and reconnections) in EUVI 171 images, with associated\nPEPs in 304 and flux rope CME in COR1.

In March 2000, he received his PhD\nfrom the University of Tokyo, Japan, on the investigation of the evolution of coronal active regions using Yohkoh data. His thesis supervisor was Prof. Shibata. Since April 2000, He has worked at GSFC\nwith Dr Gopalswamy as a contractor of CUA. His main field has been\nchanged to the CMEs .\n\nHe has maintained the CDAW Data Center which was built to organize CDAW workshops (http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov). One product of the CDAW Data Center is an event list of CMEs which is called the SOHO/LASCO CME Catalog. He has\ncompiled the catalog as a core member of the Catalog Team.\nDr Yashiro\xe2\x80\x99s main research interest is to understand the relationship between solar flares\nand CMEs. The two phenomena are thought to be different manifestations of the same\nprocess.\nIn FY09, he examined the statistical relationship between solar flares and CMEs and\nfound a good correlation between flare fluence and CME kinetic energy. Their energetic\nconnection is tighter for larger events. The kinetic energy of associated CMEs ranges\nover three orders of magnitude for a given C-class flare, while it is under two orders of\nmagnitude for a given X-class flare. The result indicates that the magnetic configuration\nof the C-class flare-CME events could have large variations, while that of the X-class\nevents might be uniform.\n\nScatter plots of CME kinetic energy versus flare peak flux (a), fluence (b), and duration (c).\n\n137\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nC.

It is built up from material released from the stars of the\nMilky Way galaxy through stellar winds, novas, and supernovas. The interstellar medium\nhas considerable structure, and the region where the solar wind interacts with the LISM is\nvery complex. IBEX uses two ENA detectors to map out this interaction region at several\nenergies. One of the first IBEX sky maps, accumulated over six months of scanning, is\nshown above. The bright ribbon of ENA emission is not predicted by any models and is\nstill not understood. IBEX images reveal global properties of the interstellar boundaries\nthat separate the heliosphere from the local interstellar medium. Because IBEX provides\nglobal maps of the interstellar interaction, IBEX observations are highly complementary\nto, and synergistic with, the detailed single-direction measurements provided by the\nVoyager satellites.\nScientific Goals: IBEX\'s sole science objective is to discover the global interaction between the solar wind and the interstellar medium. IBEX achieves this objective by taking\na set of global ENA images that answer four fundamental science questions:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What is the global strength and structure of the termination shock?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How are energetic protons accelerated at the termination shock?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What are the global properties of the solar wind flow beyond the termination shock\nand in the heliotail?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How does the interstellar flow interact with the heliosphere beyond the heliopause?\nGSFC Role: An HSD scientist is a Co-I on IBEX, and the Deputy Mission Scientist is\nalso in HSD.\nStatus: IBEX is in its prime mission and released its first all-sky maps in five papers in\nthe journal Science on 2009 October 15.\n204\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nCommunications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS)\nBackground: The C/NOFS mission includes a\nsatellite designed to investigate and forecast\nscintillations in Earth\'s ionosphere. It was\nlaunched on a Pegasus-XL rocket on 2008 April\n17 into LEO configuration with an inclination\nof 13\xc2\xb0, a perigee of 400 km, and an apogee of\n850 km. The satellite, which is operated by the\nUSAF Space Test Program, will allow the US\nmilitary to predict the effects of ionospheric activity on signals from communication and navigation satellites, outages of which could potentially cause problems in battlefield situations.\n\nC/NOFS makes comprehensive measurements\nof vector DC and wave electric fields, magnetic\nfields, plasma density and temperature, ion\ndrifts, neutral winds, and lightning detector\ncounts, and includes GPS scintillation and radio The C/NOFS Spacecraft\nbeacon experiments. Combined with strong\nmodeling and ground-based observing components, this mission promises to demonstrably advance scientific understanding of Equatorial Spread F (ESF) irregularities and their\nconditions for growth.\nCINDI Instrument on C/NOFS: The Coupled Ion Neutral Dynamic Investigation\n(CINDI) is a Mission of Opportunity investigation on C/NOFS sponsored by NASA and\ndesigned and built by the University of Texas at Dallas. CINDI involves two instruments\nthat measure the concentration and kinetic energy of the ions and neutral particles in\nspace as the satellite passes through them. This information will be used in building models to understand the various structures in the ionosphere, such as plasma depletions and\nassociated turbulence in the nightside, low-latitude ionosphere. These structures can interfere with radio signals between Earth and spacecraft in orbit, thus causing errors in\ntracking and loss of communication.\nGSFC Role on C/NOFS: HSD built the C/NOFS Vector Electric Field Instrument (VEFI), which consists primarily of an electric field detector that utilizes three orthogonal 20m tip-to-tip double-probe antennas. VEFI measures DC electric fields, which cause the\nbulk plasma motion that drives the ionospheric plasma to be unstable. Additionally, it\nmeasures the quasi-DC electric fields within the plasma density depletions to reveal the\nmotions of the depletions relative to the background ionosphere. VEFI also measures the\nvector AC electric field, which characterizes the ionospheric disturbances associated with\nspread-F irregularities. An FGM, an optical lightning detector, and a fixed-bias Langmuir\nprobe are also included in the VEFI instrument package. HSD also manages the MO&DA\nfunding for CINDI, and provides Project Scientist support.\n205\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nSignificant Milestones in FY09: The instruments have been commissioned and are returning excellent data. Among the many initial results revealed by C/NOFS instruments\nis the finding that the nightside, low-latitude ionosphere is highly structured even during\nsolar minimum and that the majority of spread-F depletions observed thus far occur postmidnight.\n\nExample of DC electric fields gathered with GSFC\xe2\x80\x99s electric field detector.\n\n206\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nAeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM)\n\nBackground: The AIM spacecraft was\nlaunched from a Pegasus rocket on 2007\nApril 25 into a 600-km orbit. It has observed three Northern Hemisphere seasons and two Southern Hemisphere seasons already.\nScientific Goals: AIM is the first satellite\nmission dedicated to the study of polar\nmesospheric clouds (PMCs), also known\nas noctilucent clouds, and it makes meaNoctilucent clouds\nsurements that can provide information on\nhow these clouds form and vary. AIM addresses the following questions:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Are there temporal variations in PMCs that can be explained by changes in solar irradiance and particle input?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What changes in mesospheric properties are responsible for north/south differences in\nPMC features?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What controls interannual variability in PMC season duration and latitudinal extent?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What is the mechanism of teleconnection between winter temperatures and summer\nhemisphere PMCs?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What is the global occurrence rate of gravity waves outside the PMC domain?\nDespite a significant increase in PMCs research in recent years, relatively little is known\nabout the basic physics of these clouds at \xe2\x80\x9cthe edge\nof space\xe2\x80\x9d and why they are changing. They have\nincreased in brightness over time, are being seen\nmore often, and appear to be occurring at lower latitudes than ever before. It has been suggested (and\ndebated) that these changes are linked to global\nclimate change.\nGSFC Role: Dr Jackman is the Project Scientist,\nDr Sigworth is the deputy Project Scientist, and Dr\nCuevas is the Mission Director of the AIM mission.\nSignificant Project Milestones in FY09:\nThe Cloud Imaging and Particle Size\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Temperature change has been found to be the (CIPS) experiment shows that clouds are\ndominant factor in controlling season onset, highly variable from orbit to orbit and\nday to day. \xe2\x80\x9cIce voids\xe2\x80\x9d were observed\nvariability during the season, and season end that look like tropospheric features.\nfor the PMCs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Meteoric smoke particles were found to be the most likely source of nucleation sites\nfor ice particles in the PMCs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PMCs are greatly affected by atmospheric waves leading to localized heating and \xe2\x80\x9cice\nvoids\xe2\x80\x9d as shown in the figure above.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 AIM entered its extended mission phase in June 2009.\n207\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nTime History of Events and Macroscale Interactions During Substorms\nBackground: With an array of spacecraft covering the near-Earth solar wind, magnetosheath, and inner and outer magnetosphere, as well as a network of ground observatories\ntracking geomagnetic perturbations and auroral signatures night after night, THEMIS\ncurrently serves as the cornerstone of the HGO, enabling researchers to understand the\nmagnetospheric response to ever-varying solar wind conditions. THEMIS also serves as a\nbridge between the ISTP and MMS/RBSP eras, enabling studies of this response as a\nfunction of solar cycle.\nScientific Goals: The primary objective of the mission is to determine the cause of geomagnetic substorms. The mission employed five identical spacecraft and an array of\nground-based all-sky imagers and magnetometers to pinpoint when and where substorm\nonset occurs in the magnetotail. Secondary and tertiary objectives of the mission include\nunderstanding the processes that accelerate thermal plasmas to form the ring current and\nradiation belts, and obtaining a detailed understanding of the solar wind-magnetosphere\ninteraction via simultaneous measurements of the solar wind, foreshock, magnetosheath,\nand magnetopause.\nGSFC Role: GSFC provides the Project Scientist and participates in scientific analysis.\nSignificant Project Milestones in FY09: The prime phase of the mission concluded in\nSeptember 2009. Press conferences on \xe2\x80\x9cDouble-cusp reconnection\xe2\x80\x9d at the 2008 Fall\nAGU, \xe2\x80\x9cMillion-amp space twisters\xe2\x80\x9d at the 2009 EGS meeting, and \xe2\x80\x9cPinpointing the substorm epicenter with Pc1 waves\xe2\x80\x9d at the 2009 Spring AGU meeting were widely covered,\nas was the publication of \xe2\x80\x9cThe origin of radiation belt hiss\xe2\x80\x9d in Science. GRL highlighted\nfield line resonance results and put dayside chorus results on its cover.\nMission Status: All instruments and spacecraft are fully operational. The same is true for\nthe ground observatories. The apogees of the outermost two spacecraft are currently being raised to lunar distance. Following lunar flybys in December 2009 to February 2010,\nthese two spacecraft will first enter Lissajous orbits paralleling the Moon next fall. They\nwill then enter permanent lunar orbits. The mission involving the two THEMIS spacecraft at the Moon will be named \xe2\x80\x9cARTEMIS\xe2\x80\x9d. The remaining three innermost spacecraft\nwill continue the core THEMIS mission; albeit with slightly different orbits that will enable determination of both meridional and azimuthal gradients. Existing datasets are widely disseminated; this will continue for forthcoming datasets. The THEMIS team holds a\nweekly science teleconference to which all scientists are invited.\n\n208\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nSolar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)\nBackground: The twin STEREO spacecraft \xe2\x80\x93 A and B \xe2\x80\x93 were\nlaunched on 2006 October 26 from Kennedy Space Center\naboard a Delta 7925 launch vehicle.

It was launched on an M-V\nrocket from Uchinoura Space Center, Japan,\non 2006 September 22. The satellite was\nmaneuvered to the quasi-circular Sunsynchronous orbit over the day/night terminator, which allows near-continuous observation of the Sun. Hinode was planned as a\nthree-year mission to explore the magnetic fields of the Sun. It consists of a coordinated\nset of optical, extreme ultraviolet (EUV), and X-ray instruments (the Solar Optical Telescope, the EUV Imaging Spectrometer, and the X-ray Telescope) to investigate the interaction between the Sun\'s magnetic field and its corona. Each of the instruments has the\nhighest angular resolution ever achieved in a solar instrument for its spectral band.\nScientific Goals: Hinode investigates the interaction between the Sun\'s magnetic field\nand the corona. The result will be an improved understanding of the mechanisms that\npower the solar atmosphere and drive solar eruptions. This information will tell how the\nSun generates magnetic disturbances and\nhigh-energy particle storms that propagate\nfrom the Sun to Earth and beyond; in this\nsense, Hinode will help scientists predict\nspace weather. It is using its three instruments together to unravel basic informa- Hinode has obtained high-resolution images of\ntion to understand:\nthe poles of the Sun, which show resolved spicules\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How energy generated by magnetic- approximately 300 km across.\nfield changes in the lower solar atmosphere (photosphere) is transmitted to the upper solar atmosphere (corona)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How that energy influences the dynamics and structure of the upper atmosphere\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How energy transfer and atmospheric dynamics affect on interplanetary space\nGSFC Role: Three members of the Hinode operations team are based at GSFC and several HSD scientists are involved in the analysis of Hinode data. Sten Odenwald and Ravi\nGrant perform Hinode E/PO activities at GSFC. The SDAC/VSO at GSFC serves Hinode\ndata to the solar community. The Hinode project is managed by MSFC.\nMission Status: Hinode\'s X-band transmitter signal began to experience irregularities in\nDecember 2007. Because of increased irregularities in February, the Hinode team is now\nperforming downlink with the backup S-band antenna. Additional JAXA, NASA, and\nNorwegian ground stations now provide more downlink opportunities. New compression\nalgorithms are being used to optimize the data downlink via available telemetry.\n\n210\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nSolar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE)\nBackground: To continue to monitor the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s\nradiative energy output and to better understand\nradiative forcing of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate, NASA\nlaunched the SORCE satellite on 2003 January 25.\nThe satellite flies at an altitude of 640 km in a 40\xc2\xb0\ninclination orbit.

The mission\xe2\x80\x99s uniqueness stems from its use\nof four spacecraft to distinguish the spatial and temporal properties of geospace boundaries. The Cluster spacecraft formation allows 3D snapshots of plasma structures and measurements of gradients in key plasma parameters. The capability to vary inter-spacecraft\nseparations enables magnetospheric investigations on different spatial scales, making it\nan active research tool. Cluster\xe2\x80\x99s multiscale era continued this past year wherein, near\napogee, three spacecraft formed an equilateral triangle 10,000 km on a side. While the\nplane of the triangle could be specified for each target, the fourth spacecraft would be\nplaced at a perpendicular distance of 20 km to 10,000 km, depending on the scientific\nfocus. In 2010, the science focus will be on the auroral acceleration region. ESA has approved another mission extension through 2012 with future scientific focus to be finalized at the Science Operations Working Group meetings.\nScientific Goals: The goals of the extended\nmission include using the four Cluster spacecraft to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Characterize solar wind and plasma sheet\nturbulence\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Study the structure of the bow shock\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determine exterior cusp structure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determine triggering and evolution of the\nauroral acceleration region\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determine the extent of magnetotail bursty bulk flows and the width of reconnection regions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Investigate E-fields in tail dynamics\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Study the plasma environment of radiation\nbelts in the inner plasmasphere\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determine chorus properties during magnetic storms and their effectiveness in accelerating MeV electrons, important for RBSP\nmission planning.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Study solar wind-magnetosphere interaction\nand substorm processes with THEMIS\n\nParallel (black) and perpendicular (red)\nmagnetic spectra from Cluster FGM (f < 33\nHz) and STAFF data (1.5 < f < 225 Hz,\ngreen and blue, correspondingly), showing\nfirst evidence of magnetic turbulence cascade for two decades above f ~ 0.4 Hz. The\nsecond breakpoint at f ~ 35 Hz and a steeper\nspectrum of f -3.9 indicate cascade and dissipation of kinetic Alfv\xc3\xa9n waves at electron\nscales [Sahraoui et al., 2009].\n\nGSFC Role: Since launch, the Project Office led by the US Cluster Project Scientist at\nGSFC manages and coordinates the work of US instrument teams and investigators. HSD\nscientists are involved in the data analysis.\nSignificant Project Milestones in FY09: Cluster achieved the first direct measurement\nof solar wind magnetofluid turbulence down to spatial scales that characterize electron\nkinetic physics.

Earth is in the center of each image, surrounded by dipole magnetic\nfield lines at 4 and 8 RE equatorial crossingpoints.\n\nIts measurement strategy is to use a neutral-atom imager and the Lyman-\xce\xb1 detector, both mounted on a rotating actuator platform to allow 360\xc2\xb0 azimuthal view. The\nTWINS instrumentation is essentially the same as the Medium-Energy Neutral Atom\n(MENA) instrument on the IMAGE mission. This instrumentation consists of a neutralatom imager covering the ~1\xe2\x80\x93100 keV energy range with 4\xc2\xb0 \xc3\x97 4\xc2\xb0 angular resolution, 1min time resolution, and a simple Lyman-\xce\xb1 imager to monitor the geocorona.\nScientific Goals:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Establish the global connectivities and causal relationships between processes in different regions of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determine the structure and evolution of the storm-time magnetosphere\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understand the energization and transport of magnetospheric plasma populations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Characterize the storm-time sources and sinks of energetic magnetospheric plasma\nGSFC Role: The project scientist from HSD participates in weekly science teleconferences, offers advice on achieving TWINS science goals, and assists in interpreting ENA\nimages. HSD scientists participate in the analysis and interpretation of the TWINS data.\nSignificant Project Milestones in FY09:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n2008 November: ENA emissions from low altitude were analyzed and found to have\nsimilar energy spectral properties to precipitating ions observed by DMSP satellites.\n\n215\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nTransition Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE)\nBackground: TRACE is a SMEX mission designed to\nstudy the connections between fine-scale magnetic\nfields and the associated plasma structures on the Sun in\na quantitative way by observing the photosphere, the\ntransition region, and the corona. It was launched by a\nPegasus rocket on 1998 April 1 into a Sun-synchronous\norbit to get near-continuous observations of the Sun.\nWith TRACE, these temperature domains can be observed nearly simultaneously and at high spatial resolution. TRACE operations will be terminated following\nintercalibration with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument on SDO which is manifested for\nlaunch in February 2010.\nScientific Goals: To simultaneously capture high spatial and temporal resolution\nimages of the transition region. The\nTRACE data will provide quantitative observational constraints on the models and\nthus stimulate real advances in understanding the transition region. The data also allow scientists to follow the evolution of\nmagnetic field structures from the solar surface to the corona, investigate the mechanisms of the heating of the outer solar atmosphere, and investigate the triggers and\nonset of solar flares and CMEs.\n\nA new-cycle active region (NOAA\nAR11005) observed by TRACE on\n2008 October 14, in Fe XII 195 \xc3\x85.\n\nTRACE identified one possible source of the\nmagnetic stress that causes flares: sunspots that\nrotate, storing energy in the magnetic field.\n\nGSFC Role: GSFC provides mission management (mission scientist and resource analyst), mission operations, scientific operations, and mirrored archive/data access facilities\nfor the TRACE SMEX mission. Mission operations are carried out in the SMEX MOC in\nBuilding 3, nearby which is the TRACE EOF. TRACE data are served by the PI team and\nvia the VSO.\n\nSignificant Project Milestones in FY09: TRACE science operations were funded only\nthrough mid-FY09 on the assumption that SDO launch and TRACE-AIA intercalibration\ncould occur before the end of the fiscal year. SDO launch delays, however, have led to\nnovel planning and budgeting by the SSMO, PI team, and Mission Scientist to accommodate the current SDO launch schedule. This has resulted in TRACE science operations\nbeing continued but scaled back during lengthening eclipse periods.\n\n216\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nAdvanced Composition Explorer (ACE)\nBackground: ACE was launched in\nAugust 1997 carrying six high-spectralresolution instruments designed to\nmeasure the elemental, isotopic, and\nionic charge-state composition of energetic nuclei from solar wind to cosmic\nray energies, and three instruments to\nprovide the interplanetary context for\nthese studies. Since January 1998, ACE\nhas been in orbit about the L1 point, 1.5\nmillion km sunward of Earth. Data from\nACE are used to study the acceleration\nand transport of solar, interplanetary,\nand galactic particles with unprecedented precision.\n\nScientific Goals: The prime objective of ACE is to measure and compare the composition of several samples of matter, including the solar corona, the solar wind, and other\ninterplanetary particle populations, the local interstellar medium, and galactic matter. The\nscientific questions for the extended mission are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How do the compositions of the Sun, solar wind, solar particles, interstellar medium,\nand cosmic rays differ, and why?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How does the solar wind originate and evolve through the solar system?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What is the structure of CMEs and other transients, and how do they evolve?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How are seed particles fractionated and selected for acceleration to high energies?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How are particles accelerated at the Sun, in the heliosphere, and in the galaxy?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How are energetic particles transported in the heliosphere and the galaxy?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What causes the solar wind, energetic particles, and cosmic rays to vary over the solar\ncycle?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How does the solar wind control the dynamic heliosphere?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How does the heliosphere interact with the interstellar medium?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How do solar wind, energetic particles, and cosmic rays contribute to space weather\nover the solar cycle?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What solar and interplanetary signatures can be used to predict space weather?\nGSFC Role: Mission operations support for ACE is provided by the SSMO Project Office, Code 444. The ACE Deputy Project Scientist is in HSD. An HSD scientist is an instrument scientist for the Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS) and for the Cosmic-Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS).\nMission Status: The objectives of the ACE Mission for FY09 through FY13 were summarized by the ACE Science Working Team in a proposal for a NASA Headquarters Senior Review in the Spring of 2008.\n217\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)\nBackground: SOHO has a white-light coronagraph that provides a Sun\xe2\x80\x93Earth line view\nof both the evolution of, and transient events\nin, the solar corona; helioseismology and\nEUV imaging instruments provide baseline\nintercalibration with SDO analogs before\nSOHO\xe2\x80\x99s end of life in order to extend measurements to a complete, 22-year solar magnetic cycle; spectrometers and particle instruments continued monitoring of the H I\nLyman-\xce\xb1 resonant scattering corona, solar\nwind, and solar energetic particles.\n\nEleven years of EUV observations of the Sun\n\nScientific Goals: There are a number of goals associated with SOHO: in conjunction\nwith SDO and STEREO, understand the causes and mechanisms of CME initiation, and\nthe propagation of CMEs through the heliosphere; continue to monitor the TSI; monitor\nthe H I Lyman-\xce\xb1 corona in order to improve scientific understanding of solar wind acceleration and the distributions of seed particles accelerated as solar energetic particles;\ncontinue the measurement of interstellar winds; continue the search for global solar gmodes; and provide operational predictions of solar energetic particles during manned\nspace missions.\nGSFC Role: GSFC provides project management, mission operations, scientific operations, an analysis facility, and archive/data access facilities for the SOHO mission. The\nSDAC houses, among other data sets, all SOHO data other than the Michelson Doppler\nImager helioseismology archive and serves it to the worldwide scientific community via\nthe Internet, through both the SOHO archive interface and the VSO.

Wind is a\nspin-stabilized spacecraft launched in\n1994 November 1 and placed in a halo\norbit around L1, more than 200 RE upstream of Earth, to observe the unperturbed solar wind that is about to impact\nthe magnetosphere of Earth. Wind, together with ACE and SOHO, provide the\n1-AU baseline for inner and outer heliospheric missions.\n\nWind provides a third point of solar wind observations\nenhancing the science return of the STEREO mission as\nwell as continuing to monitor the solar wind input for\ngeospace studies.\n\nScientific Goals: The primary science\nobjectives of the Wind mission are as\nfollows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide complete plasma, energetic-particle, and magnetic-field measurements for\nmagnetospheric and ionospheric studies\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Investigate basic plasma processes occurring in the near-Earth solar wind\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide baseline, 1-AU, ecliptic-plane observations for inner and outer heliospheric\nmissions\n\nGSFC Role: Three of the still-functioning seven instruments were developed at GSFC,\nnamely the Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI; A.

Knowledge of the physical\nprocesses operating at these boundaries\nis vital to understanding the flow of\nmass and energy from the Sun to\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere. The long-lived\nGeotail spacecraft continues to provide\ncritical and unique geospace measurements essential to fulfilling the key objectives of the HGO at minimal cost.\n\nAdvances in magnetospheric physics often result from\nmulti-spacecraft coordination as shown here. Geotail\nmade measurements of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the low-latitude dusk boundary layer while Cluster simultaneously detected high-latitude reconnection\nnear the noon meridian.\n\nScientific Goals: During the current\nextended mission, the Geotail science\nfocuses are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Providing extensive coverage of the magnetospheric boundary layer to delineate mechanisms controlling the entry and transport of plasma into the magnetosphere that is\nthen energized to produce magnetic storms\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Providing supplementary measurements to THEMIS to reveal the spatial and temporal scales of substorm phenomena in the magnetotail\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Providing near-Earth plasma and magnetic field measurements as Geotail spends\nabout 35% of its time in the solar wind\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Providing an important complementary data source for validation of global simulations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Providing observations that define the location and physics of tail magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determining energetic-particle environments up to, and including, penetrating \xce\xb3-rays\nGSFC Role: GSFC provides ground-data-system support for Geotail. Deep Space Network (DSN) telemetry data are transferred to the GSFC data system, which performs the\ninitial reduction and merging with trajectory data provided by the Japanese.

Voyager 1,\nmore than three times the distance of Pluto, is farther from Earth than any other humanmade object and speeding outward at more than 65,000 km/hr. Both spacecraft are still sending scientific information about their surroundings through the\nDSN.\nScientific Goals: The goals for the Voyager spacecraft are to explore the interaction of\nthe heliosphere with the local interstellar medium and to study the heliosheath. Major\nmysteries remain unresolved, such as the size and shape of the heliosphere and the source\nand acceleration mechanism for the anomalous cosmic rays. The Voyager Interstellar\nMission (VIM), in combination with IBEX, should be able to answer some of these\nquestions. The nature of the turbulence and the dynamics of major solar wind structures\ndownstream of the termination shock will also be examined by the VIM.\nGSFC Role: GSFC\'s principal contribution is through the Magnetometer (MAG)\ninstrument.\nSignificant Project Milestones in FY09: The two Voyager spacecraft have been heading\nout of the solar system for over 30 years. Voyager 2 crossed the termination shock in\n2007 at about 11 billion kilometers from the Sun, and Voyager crossed the termination shock in 2004. The turbulence in the heliosheath is unlike that observed in\nthe supersonic solar wind or anywhere on Earth. It is highly compressive and contains a great variety or coherent structures as well as chaotic variations. Correcting\nfor the decreasing polar magnetic fields near the Sun associated with the unique solar\ncycle 23, it was found that the radial gradient of the magnetic field strength in the inner\nheliosheath is between 0.017 and 0.055 micro-Gauss/AU. This observation is consistent\nwith a recent 3D MHD model of the magnetized flow in the heliosheath.\n221\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nAPPENDIX 4: FUTURE MISSIONS\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)\n\nBackground: SDO is the first LWS mission. It will\nuse telescopes to study the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field, the\ninterior of the Sun, and changes in solar activity.\nSome of the telescopes will take pictures of the Sun,\nwhile others will view the Sun as a star.\nScientific Goals: The primary goal of the SDO\nmission is to understand\xe2\x80\x94driving towards a predictive capability\xe2\x80\x94the solar variations that influence\nlife on Earth and humanity\xe2\x80\x99s technological systems\nby determining:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field is generated and\nstructured\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How this stored magnetic energy is converted\nand released into the heliosphere and geospace\nin the form of solar wind, energetic particles,\nand variations in the solar irradiance\n\nThe SDO spacecraft\n\nThe SDO spacecraft\n\nGSFC Role: GSFC built the spacecraft, designed and built the dedicated ground system,\nand Dean Pesnell (HSD) is the Project Scientist. Several HSD people are part of the\nscience investigation and help with E/PO. After launch, SDO will be managed by GSFC.\nMission Status: In FY09, SDO made ready for its\nlaunch. In August SDO was shipped to the AstroTech\nfacility near the Kennedy Space Center, where testing\nof the observatory continues. Due to delays in the Atlas\nV launch vehicle manifest, SDO remains on the ground\nwaiting for a launch date, now expected in early 2010.\nDuring the hiatus the science teams have worked on\nbuilding the data system required to handle the enormous data flow SDO will generate.\nSDO is built, tested, and ready to launch.\n\nThe EVE experiment will measure solar\nEUV irradiance with unprecedented spectral resolution, temporal cadence, and\nprecision.\n\n222\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nRadiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP)\n\nBackground: Charged particles in the Van Allen radiation\nbelts of the inner magnetosphere have energies sufficient\nto pose a hazard to both astronauts and spacecraft. A host of\nprocesses have been proposed\nto account for the variations in\nstrength of the radiation belts as\na function of time and location.\nThe distances separating the\nRBSP spacecraft will vary over\nthe course of this two-spacecraft mission, enabling researchers to distinguish between\nspatial and temporal effects, determine cause and effect, and identify the spatial extent of\nphenomena relevant to radiation belt physics. Both spacecraft will carry beacons to provide real-time observations of the radiation belts to space weather forecasters.\nScientific Goals: The objectives of the RBSP mission are to determine:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Which physical processes produce radiation belt enhancement events\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What are the dominant mechanisms for relativistic electron loss\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How ring current and other geomagnetic processes affect radiation belt behavior\nGSFC Role: GSFC retains overall technical authority for the mission, but applies \xe2\x80\x9clighttouch\xe2\x80\x9d management over this mission, which has been assigned to JHU/APL. All Project\nScience responsibilities have been assigned to JHU/APL.\nSignificant Project Milestones in FY09: The mission entered Phase C/D on 2009 January 1 following a successful KDP-C review.\nMission Status: Spacecraft and instruments are currently undergoing critical design reviews, preparatory for the mission CDR scheduled for December 2009. The planned\nlaunch date is in May 2012.\n\n223\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nMagnetospheric MultiScale (MMS)\nBackground: The details of how\nnature releases large amounts of\nenergy are not well understood, although the conversion of magnetic\nenergy from reconnection of oppositely directed fields into heated\nplasma and energetic particles appears to play a central role. It has\nnot been possible to replicate the\ntypical conditions in the laboratory,\nor to diagnose the physical\nprocesses that control the release of\nenergy, particularly at the small\nspatial scales where electrons become unmagnetized.\n\nEarth Magnetic\nEarth\nField Lines\nEarth\n\nSolar\nWind\n\nMMS mission\nconcept\n\nMagnetic reconnection at the magnetospheric boundary\n\nScientific Goals: Observations of reconnection require\nthe 3D determination of the magnetic field and plasma\nin the vicinity of the site of particle energization. The\noverall goal of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)\nmission is to understand the microphysics of reconnection by determining the kinetic processes responsible\nfor its initiation and evolution. MMS will determine the\nrole played by electron inertial effects and turbulent\ndissipation in driving magnetic reconnection and will\nalso determine the rate of magnetic reconnection and\nthe parameters that control it.\n\nGSFC Role: MMS is a major GSFC product and involves many resources in HSD.\nOverall, the project is managed at GSFC and the four spacecraft will be built at GSFC.\nThe Project Scientist, Dr Goldstein, and the two Deputy Project Scientists, Dr Adrian and\nDr Le, are members of HSD, as is the Lead Investigator for the Fast Plasma Instrument\n(FPI), Dr Moore. The Dual Electron Sensors will be built and tested at GSFC. The Japanese-built Dual Ion Sensors are the responsibility of HSD. HSD scientists are also members of the Fields, Theory and Modeling, and Interdisciplinary Science Teams.\nMission Status: MMS is now in Phase C and is proceeding with the final design and initial hardware builds. A major renovation and expansion of the HSD laboratory facilities\nis nearing completion. A CDR will be held later this year.\n\n224\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nSolar Orbiter\n\nBackground: The Sun\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere and the heliosphere are\nunique regions of space, where fundamental physical processes common to solar, astrophysical, and laboratory plasmas can be studied in\ndetail and under conditions impossible to reproduce on Earth. The results from SOHO and Ulysses have\nenormously advanced scientific understanding of the solar corona, the\nassociated solar wind, and the 3D\nheliosphere. However, the point has\nbeen reached where in situ measurements much closer to the Sun,\ncombined with high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy at high latitudes, promise to\nbring about major breakthroughs.\nScientific Goals: The broad science objective is to gain a better understanding of solar\nactivity and variability. In practice, it means extending scientific knowledge of the solar\ninterior to higher latitudes and greater depths, beyond what SDO can achieve. Studying\nthe near-surface layers at high latitudes is a prime objective. Probing the deep interior\nwith sufficient accuracy may, however, require longer observation durations than will be\npossible. Demonstrating the concept of stereoscopic helioseismology is also an important\nobjective. SDO and/or ground-based facilities, together with Solar Orbiter, would make a\nmost powerful combination.\nGSFC Role: GSFC is hosting the US Solar Orbiter Project Office and managing four PI\nteams and the launch vehicle. Hardware for two of those US-contributed instruments\n(SPICE and SWA-HIS) are being provided by GSFC Co-I\xe2\x80\x99s.\nMission Status: The Solar Orbiter mission is in Phase A (formulation). It is participating\nin ESA\xe2\x80\x99s Cosmic Visions M-class competition, and a down-select among the competitors\nis to be announced in February 2010.\n\n225\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science Highlights\n\nSolar Probe Plus (SP+)\n\nBackground: SP+ is humanity\xe2\x80\x99s first visit to the Sun to explore the complex and timevarying interplay of the Sun and Earth, which affects human activity. SP+ will determine\nwhere and what physical processes heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind to its\nsupersonic velocity. A combined remote-sensing and in situ sampling from within the\nsolar corona itself will provide a \xe2\x80\x9cground truth\xe2\x80\x9d never before available from astronomical\nmeasurements made from spacecraft in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s orbit or Lagrangian points. SP+ is currently under study as part of NASA\'s SMD.\nThe baseline mission provides for 24 perihelion passes inside 0.16 AU (35 RS), with\n19 passes occurring within 20 RS of the\nSun. The first near-Sun pass occurs 3\nmonths after launch, at a heliocentric distance of 35 RS. Over the next several\nyears, successive Venus gravity assist\n(VGA) maneuvers gradually lower the\nperihelia to ~9.5 RS\xe2\x80\x94by far the closest\nany spacecraft has ever come to the Sun.\nThe spacecraft completes its nominal mission with three passes, separated by 88\ndays, at this distance.\n\nArtist concept of the SP+ spacecraft from\nthe SP+ STDT report.\n\nScientific Goals: Although the SP+\nscience objectives remain the same as\nthose established for Solar Probe in 2005, the new mission design differs dramatically\nfrom the 2005 design (as well as from all previous Solar Probe mission designs since the\n1970s). The 2005, and earlier, missions involved one or two flybys of the Sun at a perihelion distance of 4 RS by a spacecraft placed into a solar polar orbit by means of a Jupiter\ngravity assist. In contrast, SP+ remains nearly in the ecliptic plane and makes many nearSun passes at increasingly lower perihelia.\nGSFC Role: GSFC will provide a mission scientist and will participate in instrument\nproposals.\nMission Status: A NASA Announcement of Opportunity soliciting instrument proposals\nis expected in late 2009.\n\n226\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2009 Science
