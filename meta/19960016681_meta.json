Wake deceleration is known to lead to sudden thickening and the onset of reversed flow; this 'wake bursting' phenomenon can occur while surface flows remain attached. Although known to be important for high-lift systems, few studies of such decelerated wakes exist. In this study, the wake of a flat plate has been subjected to an adverse pressure gradient in a two-dimensional diffuser, whose panels were forced to remain attached by use of slot blowing. Pitot probe surveys, L.D.V. measurements, and flow visualization have been used to investigate the physics of this decelerated wake, through the onset of reversed flow.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19960016681, "name": "13th AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference", "id": "cf21cde3e7cd4c9eb77975f2db56819c", "startDate": "1995-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960016681, "id": "f671c93df2704a48832ddcbcbea5a7ce", "publicationDate": "1996-02-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960016681.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960016681/downloads/19960016681.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960016681/downloads/19960016681.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960016681/downloads/19960016681.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
