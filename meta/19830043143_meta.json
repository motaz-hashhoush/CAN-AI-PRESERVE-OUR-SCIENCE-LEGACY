In structural design terms, space station growth can be achieved by increasing design safety factors, introducing dynamic isolators to prevent loads from reaching the initial components, or preplanning the refurbishment of the original structure with stronger elements. Design tradeoffs will be based on the definition of on-orbit loads, including docking and maneuvering, whose derived load spectra will allow the estimation of fatigue life. Improvements must be made in structural materials selection in order to reduce contamination, slow degradation, and extend the life of coatings. To minimize on-orbit maintenance, long service life lubrication systems with advanced sealing devices must be developed.", "title": "Structures and mechanisms - Streamlining for fuel economy", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T15:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830043143, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Card, M.
