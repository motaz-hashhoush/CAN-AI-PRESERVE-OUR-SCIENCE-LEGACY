The environment on the lunar surface is defined by intense ultraviolet radiation, solar wind radiation (primarily electrons and protons), electrically charged dust layers, and temperatures as low as -200 C. As NASA makes plans to send manned missions to the moon's surface, significant preparation must be undertaken to ensure that the materials and mechanical components used on those missions can survive in the harsh environment. The work presented will detail the development of the Lunar Environment Test System (LETS) at the Marshall Space Flight Center that will allow scientists and engineers the ability to test new materials, mechanical components, and proposed mission hardware in a representative lunar surface environment. The LETS encompasses all the environments of the lunar surface including vacuum, thermal extremes, vacuum ultraviolet radiation, and protons and electrons from the solar wind.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20080015645, "endDate": "2008-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute for Space and Nuclear Power Studies", "location": "Albuquerque, NM, United States"}}, "meetingId": "959da39e0b0347fdb07c27f4e285977e", "id": "c8c094aee4d74b79954f481999f436de"}], "name": "Space Technology and Applications International Forum, STAIF-2008", "location": "Albuquerque, NM", "id": "959da39e0b0347fdb07c27f4e285977e", "startDate": "2008-02-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080015645, "id": "4e7b0cac851e4f6cac7cccd2feb42591", "publicationDate": "2008-02-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
