The increasing interest in GaAs device structures increased steadily during that period. The leading research and development centers and the specific areas of interest were identified. A workshop on GaAs was held in November 1977 to assess the present status of melt-grown GaAs and the existing needs for reliable chemical, structural, and electronic characterization methods. It was concluded that the present available bulk GaAs crystals are of poor quality and that GaAs technology is lagging demonstrated or potentially feasible GaAs devices and systems.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790006021, "id": "33d8964d62ec4fa995400d943b19c681", "publicationDate": "1979-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790006021.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790006021/downloads/19790006021.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790006021/downloads/19790006021.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790006021/downloads/19790006021.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
