The operation of the eight zone furnace is based on a self-tuning temperature\ncontrol system with a DC power supply for optimal thermal stability. We show that the desired thermal profile\nover the entire length of the furnace consists of a functional combination of the fundamental thermal profiles for\neach individual zone obtained by setting the set-point temperature for that zone. The self-tuning system accounts\nfor the zone to zone thermal interactions. The control system operates such that the thermal profile is maintained\nunder thermal load, thus boundary conditions on crystal growth ampoules can be predetermined prior to crystal\ngrowth. Temperature profiles for the growth of crystals via directional solidification, vapor transport techniques,\nand multiple gradient applications are shown to be easily implemented. The unique feature of its transparency\nand ease of programming thermal profiles make the furnace useful for scientific and commercial applications for\nthe determination of process parameters to optimize crystal growth conditions.\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the fundamental variables in crystal growth applications is the tuning of the thermal gradient, we\npresent an innovative multizone transparent furnace design which allows precise control of the thermal field. The\nfeatures of the furnace, from the standpoint of technical merit, which make it attractive are its transparency and\nease of programming the desired thermal profile. The transparency feature of the furnace lends it the commercial\npotential for on-line quality control of crystal growth. The scientific application of the furnace is crystal growth of\nacousto-optic optoelectronic materials such as lead and mercurous halides, nonlinear optics, photonics, low\ntemperature semiconductors and organic crystals, which span the temperature range of 25 \xc2\xb0C to 750 \xc2\xb0C.\nFor applications to the growth of bulk single crystal growth, it has been widely recognized by many\ninvestigators [1-4] that the thermal field affects the crystalline quality. These applications stem primarily from\ncrystals grown by directional solidification for which the macroscopic shape of the solid-liquid interface is used as\nfeedback for quantification of the localized thermal gradient. Though planar interfaces are preferable from the\nstandpoint of minimization of thermal stresses [1], a convex interface may be beneficial for some applications.\nThus, there exists benefits for tailoring the thermal profile to achieve certain desired outcomes.\nTraditionally, crystals are grown in a two zone Bridgrnan furnace which provides two temperature baths, a\nhot and a cold zone, with a thermal gradient between the two zones. Chang and Wilcox [4] showed that the\nsensitivity of the interface shape can be decreased by inserting a layer of insulation between the cold and hot zone.\nThe insulated layer causes the heat transfer to be unidirectional near the solid-liquid interface; this results in a\nnearly flat interface. Although this approach is desirable, the insulation layer blocks the view of the solid-liquid\ninterface, which results in the loss of vital information. We introduce the design of a transparent eight zone\nfurnace which allows the tailoring of thermal gradients. Due to its versatility, multiple gradients can be achieved\nwhereby the heat transfer can be made unidirectional over a segment, without the use of insulation, thus preserving\nthe transparency of the furnace. In addition to directional solidification applications, this furnace is useful for\ncrystal growth by the physical vapor transport process which requires a thermal profile with a "hump" used to\nprevent spontaneous nucleation. This thermal profile has been used by Hartmann and Schonherr [5, 6] to measure\ncrystal growth rates by relaxation. We present the design of the furnace and show thermal profiles of interest for\nboth directional solidification as well as physical vapor transport used in applications to grow crystals.\n\n2.0 EXPERIMENTAL\n2.1 Innovative\n\nDESIGN\n\nFurnace Design\n\nThe basic characteristic of a crystal growth furnace is a device that allows a uniform thermal gradient to\nbe established inside an enclosure with optimum temperature stability. In addition, this device should allow a\nrange of thermal gradients to be set-up in order to allow optimization of crystal growth parameters, an important\nfeature for directional solidification applications [7, 8]. Through several iterations, Batur et. al. [9,10], we have\nconstructed an eight zone furnace, shown in Figure i, that fulfills our objectives. This furnace consists of two\nconcentric quartz cylinders (high optical grade quartz \'GE-214\'), of height 52 cm, inner diameter of 4.3 cm with\nwall thickness 3ram, and outer diameter of outer cylinder of 6.8 cm with wall thickness of 2 ram. A spiral helical\ngroove, of equal depth and width of 1.27 mm, is imbedded on the outer surface of the inner cylinder with constant\npitch. The heating kanthal wires are imbedded as a continuous coil on the outer surface of the inner cylinder. This\nallows the heat flux to be nearly uniform azimuthally; in addition the quartz tube act as a low pass filter to damp\nhigh frequency noise from the power supply. The outer cylinder which acts as an insulator is split axially, thus\nconsists of two sections which allows for ease of instrumentation. The connection from the furnace, approximately\n1.25 to 2 cm from the outer cylinder, to the main power supply requires the joining of the kanthal wire to 99% pure\nnickel by butt welding. The lower resistance of the nickel minimizes heat loss to the ambient environment. The\nheating elements (A-l, Kanthal wire) are placed into the spiral ground groove of the inner cylinder in a manner\nwhich minimizes the gap between heating elements.\nto\nampoule\n\n_\nTran$l\n\nview\n\nf-Detoiled\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n0\xc2\xa2\n\nheoting\n\n_\'_\ny\n\nZonel\n8on\n\n_Type\n\nK\n\nWire\nGroove\n\nDio\n\n=\nDig.\n\n0 tlon:\n\n] Motor\n\nelements\n\nOuar\'t z t\n\ntad\n\nController\n\n.]12cm\n= .127c_\n\nthernocouples\n\nI\n\nI\nmConnect;ons\n\ntO\n\nheating\n\nzone\nheating\nzone\n\nIZone21\n\nI 8or, I\n\n[\n\nI\nI\na l _\ni\nl\nI\n, iZone31\n_1 I 5on\n,\n\n\xc2\xa3rom\n\n\'\n\nTher mocouples\n\nI\nI Llll\nl\n\n!\n\n1\n\n,\n\nlCros_\n\nSectional\n\n.\n\n[nner\nFluter\n\nNotes,\nguortz\n\nt_be\ntube\n\nLength\nLength\n\ntubes\n\nore\n\n:\n=\n\n52Cn,\n52cm.\n\nwoII\nwall\n\nGE-2|4-LD\n\nthickness\nthickness\n\n(high\n\n:\n=\n\noptlcol\n\nZone4\n\n_\n\nI\n\n3On\n2on\n\ngrade)\n\nIB0"-GL-H_\n_\n\'\n\nVlew\n\nm\n\n_-\\._\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n_k: \xc2\xb0 \'\n\nz\n_\nSymmetrical\nww\nbotton\n\nwith\nhal\xc2\xa2\n\nrespect\nnot\n\nshov, to n\n\n"this\nww\n\nline\n\nLeft\n\n_\n\n?r\n\n68Onto\n270"_\n\nFigure 1- Schematic diagram of the furnace with ampoule and its associated\nlocation for wall temperature measurements.\n\nhardware, cross sectional view shows\n\nThe optimum length of the zones is selected to allow maximum power input for a given coil in order to achieve a\ncertain temperature range. Whereas, the optimal pitch of the heater wires for each zone is selected such that\nmaximum visibility is achieved through the heating coils. This feature makes the furnace useful for flow\nvisualization studies as demonstrated by Lan et.al. [1 I]. The heating zone lengths necessary to meet our criteria\nare as follows: top and bottom zones of equal lengths Z_ = _ = Z7 =Z8 = 8.0 cm, and equal lengths of the inner\nfour zones: Z3 = Z4 = Z5 =Z6 = 5.0 cm. This heating arrangement can provide an operating range from 25 \xc2\xb0C to\n750 \xc2\xb0C and thermal gradients from 2 \xc2\xb0C/cm to 45 \xc2\xb0C/cm.\n\n2.2 Temperature\n\nControl --- Hardware Implementation\n\nThe furnace zone temperatures are measured on the outside wall of the inner quartz tube with K type\nthermocouples. The thermocouple beads are of 0.5 mm in diameter and they are housed inside the small blind\nholes which are machined on the outside surface of the quartz tube. The positioning of thermocouples in this\nfashion insures that the beads are at equal distance from the centerline of the furnace. Therefore, the temperatures\nare controlled at equidistant locations with respect to the centerline. The measured temperatures are cold junction\ncompensated and digitized by a Keithley analog to digital converter. The conversion resolution is 12 bits and,\ntherefore, based on 0 - 1000 \xc2\xb0C temperature range the smallest amount of temperature change that the\nmeasurement system can detect is about 0.25 \xc2\xb0C.\nThe power inputs to heating zones are delivered through eight Copley servo power amplifiers. A 12 bit\ndigital to analog (D/A) card from Keithley supplies a control voltage of 0 - I0 V to each servo amplifier. Since\nthe D/A card is of 12 bits, a minimum amount of voltage change that the D/A card can send to the servo\namplifier is about 2.5 mV. This effectively defines the resolution of the control signal. The servo amplifier can\nprovide up to 500 W power to each heating zone. The gain of each amplifier is set to a level such that the (0- 10) V\ninput from the D/A board corresponds to (0 - Vs) Volts where V, is the supply voltage. There are two Hewlett\nPackard regulated DC power supplies, connected in parallel and providing up to 8000 W of power to heating\nzones through power amplifiers. The main advantage of using a DC power supply is the elimination of power\nsupply induced disturbances. These disturbances are inherent to an AC power supplied furnace. This is due to the\nfact that there are basically two different ways that one can use to deliver the power from an AC source to the\nfurnace in a regulated manner. One way is based on changing the power activation point within each cycle of the\nAC voltage. Since this implies a sudden current change to the heater within each cycle, the resulting effect is the\nelectrical noise due to inductive effects. The second type of systems use zero crossing and duty cycle modulation\nwhere the duty cycle is defined as the ratio between the (power on) time to (power on + plus power off) time.\nUnder this system, the heating zone effectively operates under ON-OFF control and if the duty cycle is small this\nON-OFF type power regulation introduces its own disturbance into the thermal dynamics. The DC power supply\ncompletely eliminates the power supply induced disturbances. A schematic that shows the main features of the\nhardware is also given in Figure 1.\n2.3 Temperature\n\nControl --- Software Implementation\n\nand Thermal Model\n\nThe temperature of each zone is controlled by a self-tuning PI (Proportional - Integral) control algorithm.\nThere are two kind of disturbances that require the self-tuning control action. The first group is due to the motion\nof the ampoule and the interface which change the thermal dynamics of the heating zone because of changes of\nthermal inertia within the zone during motion. The second disturbance is caused by the inevitable zone to zone\nheat exchange since the heating zones are not thermally insulated. At each sampling instant the temperature\ncontrol algorithm first updates the thermal model of the zone so that the current input output data fit the model in a\nleast squares sense. We assume the following dynamic model for the purpose of controller design\nT(t) = A.T(t1) +B.u(t1) + e(t) (1)\nWhere u, TeR 8 are the process inputs and the measured zone temperatures respectively and e(t)eR g indicates the\ninevitable zone to zone thermal interaction on the temperatures. The matrices A,BcR 8Xsdefine the thermal\ndynamics of the system. The process input is determined by the temperature controller and it is the energy flow\ninto eight heating zones, i.e., u=(ul,u2 ..... us) r . Once the thermal model is updated, the parameters of the PI\ncontroller is modified in order to take into account the most recent changes in thermal dynamics. The model\nupdating is based on the multivariable Least Squares criterion, i.e., at each sampling instant the model matrices A\nand B are updated such that the residuals are minimum, i.e., the following identification performance index is\nminimum\nt\n\nVID = trace{argLfi\n\nmin[_(k)._r(k)]}\n\n(2),\n\nk=l\n\nwhere the residual of the model is given by\n_(k)\n\n= T(t)-,&.T(t-l)-t3.\n\nu(t-1)\n\n(3) .\n\nThe modification of the PI control parameters is based on the eigenvalue placement whereby the PI control\nparameters are changed such that the control system generates the fastest corrective response to the disturbances\nwithout causing overshoot or undershoot in the zone temperature. The details of the algorithm can be found in\n[12l.\n3.0 ENERGETICS AND MEASUREMENTS\n3,1 Relationshio\n\nOF THERMAL PROFILES\n\nbetween Set-points and Measured Temperatures\n\nA given temperature profile in the furnace is established by setting eight discrete temperatures, T_, T2, T3,\n..... Ts, at the midpoint of each zone on the outer surface of the inner cylinder. Previous designs in which holes\nwere drilled along the axis of the inner tube suffered from significant heat loss which prevented a uniform thermal\nfield inside the furnace. When a given zone, Zt is activated at a temperature Ti, the control system set-up a heat\nflux distribution, q"(O,z) at r = Ro on the outer surface of the inner cylinder. Some of this heat is lost and the\nremaining is transmitted inside the furnace which results in thermal equilibrium due to contributions of the heat\nflow modes, namely, conduction, convection, and thermal radiation. Since the temperature along the inside wall\n(r = Ri) can be readily measured, the imposed boundary condition may be denoted by the temperature distribution\nT = T(r = R,, O, z) instead of the heat flux. In order to ascertain the relationship between set-point temperatures\nand the temperatures inside the furnace, we use a calibrated NIST-Standard type S thermocouple to measure the\nthermal profile. Since we have air inside the furnace, fundamentally the temperature profile is influenced by\nbuoyancy induced flows due to density gradients, this problem may be posed as follows:\nFor a set-point temperature, Ti which establishes a surface temperature\nT=T(0 ,z) at r=R_, (4),\nalong the inside wall of the inner cylinder for a given zone Z_, buoyancy induced flows will ensue inside the\nfurnace when the axial heat loss along the wall creates unstably stratified air layers. This heat loss causes a\ngaussian-like temperature distribution for the individual inner zones of the furnace _-Z7. The density of air, a\nhomogeneous fluid, is a function of temperature and pressure,\n\nWithin first order approximation\n\nthe effect of pressure may be neglected so that,\n1 c\nTo]+ 2t. __2 p (T-\n\np=po+_f(T-\n\nTol 2 + .....\n\n(6).\n\nThe subscript o indicates a mean value, due to small variation of the density with temperature, second order\nderivatives and higher may be neglected. Regions in which the density field becomes unstably stratified, due to an\nadverse density field variation from equation 6, will give rise to a flow field which satisfies the conservation of\nmass, balance of momentum, and conservation of energy as follows:\n\nV \xe2\x80\xa2 I7 = 0\n\n(7)\n\nDr7\nP0\n\nDt\n\n-\n\nVP + \xc2\xa2tV=17 +p\nDT\n-= at V2T\nDt\n\nI"7represents the flow field, _ is the gravitational acceleration,\n\n(8)\n\n(9).\np and a are the dynamic viscosity and thermal\n\ndiffusivity of the fluid. The density field variation equation (6) gives the coupling between the energy equation (9)\nand the momentum equation (8). The solution to this problem can be determined numerically to obtain the\ntemperature field inside the furnace,\nT=T(r, 0, z, t ), (10)\nas a predictive tool for a prescribed boundary condition. Alternatively, the temperature field can be measured to\nobtain the solution. In our case we measured the temperature field and found that azimuthal symmetry, i.e. T(r,z),\nin the gradient region for linear temperature profiles is a good approximation. Even though, there is a slight radial\n\ndependence,\nthetemperature atthecenterline,\nprofile\nT=T(z) tr=0,gives\na\nagood\nindication the\nof\n\ntemperature\n\ngradient.\n\n3.2 The elements of thermal profile\nThe measured centerline thermal profile consists of a functional combination of the profile of individual\nzones. Figure 2, shows the corresponding thermal profile for a set point temperatures ofT=373 \xc2\xb0C applied at each\nzone individually, the origin of the coordinate system is at the top of the furnace. These profiles correspond to one\nzone in operation, while keeping the other zones off. Since zone 1 is near the top, the heat loss near the top of the\nquartz tube is minimal. There is a local temperature maximum in zone 1 which decreases exponentially toward\nthe bottom of the furnace. In contrast, note that heat loss, for all the zones, along the axial direction towards the\ntop of the furnace increases as the zone distance from the top of the furnace increases. This effect of heat loss is\naugmented by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability which occurs due to unstable air density stratification, which is\nshown by the scatter of data near the top region, illustrated more clearly for zone 6. This convective flow situation\ndenoted by 1,7 equation (8) occurs because the air density decreases, above the location of the maximum\nin\ntemperature, for example zone 4; this provides a situation where a heavy air layer lies on top of a lighter layer\nwhich gives rise to a convective flow field. The scatter of the data as shown in zone 6 is attributed to this\nconvective instability. On the other hand, note that toward the bottom of the furnace the temperature profile is\nsmooth; this is because as the temperature decreases the lighter fluid air elements overlays the heavier elements\nwhich provide a stable situation. Thus, there is no convective flow. The gaussian-like wall temperature\ndistribution as shown in our furnace has similar effect on driving buoyancy induced convection as the case of a\nheat source at the bottom of the furnace [13] in which the walls would either have a linear imposed temperature\ngradient or be insulated.\nThe temperature profiles in Figure 2 showed the one dimensional (I-D) behavior of the thermal field at\nthe centerline, however, for a given axial location (z) it is likely that there exists 3-D thermal surfaces in the\n(r, O) plane. In order to investigate this likelihood, in addition to the centerline we also probed the inside wall of\nthe furnace to permit a 3-D reconstruction of the temperature field. In contrast to the measurements in Figure 2\nwhich used an AC based power system (kanthal wire diameter. 125cm), we switched to a DC based system with\ndifferent kanthal heating wire diameter .081cm, hence different resistance. Using the same set-point as before 373\n\xc2\xb0C, we obtained the same trends in zone 4 shown in Figure 3, however, the magnitude of the response temperature\nin the furnace varied. The wall temperatures were measured at the z-plane which corresponds to 0\xc2\xb0 (Right), 90 \xc2\xb0\n\n(Rear),\n\n3715\n\nZ-1,373\nt:\n\n32g\n350\n\n.

Top numerical numbers indicate zone set-point temperatures (\xc2\xb0C), bottom numbers inside\nplot indicate location of boundaries between zones.\n180\xc2\xb0 (Left), 270 \xc2\xb0 (Front), respectively as shown in Figure 1. The results show that maximum deviation from the\ncenterline temperature occurs in the neighborhood of the local maximum z=25 cm of the thermal profile. A 3-D\nreconstruction shows that the thermal surface corresponds to a skewed paraboloid of revolution at z=25 cm. Note\nthat near the top of the furnace z < 19 cm, the centerline temperature becomes higher than the wall temperatures.\nThis trend is attributed to intense convective motion as we had discussed earlier. In contrast for z > 30 cm in\nwhich there is no convective motion, the centerline temperature is approximately the same as the wall\ntemperatures. The isothermal surface for the location z = 35 cm would correspond to a skewed hemisphere, note\nthat the centerline temperature is greater than most of the wall temperatures for this region. Much of the\nskewdness in the 3-D representation stems from the helical path of the heating wire which will inevitably cause\nlocal temperature nonuniformity on the wall of the furnace. Since the majority of practical thermal profiles for\ncrystal growth is obtained by fixing a hot and a cold zone similar to the region z > 30 cm, the centerline\ntemperature profile would give a good representation of the thermal gradient. Though, we have shown the furnace\nresponse when a single zone is activated, the effect of activating two or three zones simultaneously using the same\nset-point is to broaden the peak of the thermal profile such that a flat isothermal region is obtained.\n\n3150\n\nZ-l__\n\nZ-2,0\n\n......\ni\n\ni\n\nZ-3_O\n\ni\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nw5\n\ni\n\nZo6 0\n\ni\n\n_:\n\n_"\n\n_--\n\n0\n\n5\n\n. _\n\n10\n\n._-\n\ni."\n\n:\n\n:\n\n16\n\n20\n\n"\n\ni\n\nZ-7_O\n\ni\n\ni\n\n_ -\n\n_\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nZ-8_O\n\n_\n\n_\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n[.....\n\ni\n\n3o0\n\n_oo\n\nZ-4f373\n\ni\n\ni\n\n::\n\n/\n\n:\n\n:\n\n!\n\ni\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nC._o,\n\ni\n\n25\n\n_ro_,\n\nz, Location\n\n50\n\n65\n\n(cm)\n\nFigure 3 - Comparison of wall and centerline temperatures when only zone 4 is activated for a set-point of 373\xc2\xb0C.\nSet-point temperatures of 0 \xc2\xb0C indicate no power supplied to zones.\nGiven the individual performance of the various zones, operation of all the zones in synchronization\nresults in nearly isothermal conditions over a segment, 25cm< z < 35cm, of the furnace shown in Figure 4. All\nthe zones were set to the same temperature for each case, slight adjustments can be made to achieve the desired\nlevel of isothermality. Crystal growth under practical conditions requires specific thermal profiles, we show\nvarious profiles measured at the centerline as well as the wall to give an indication on how well the furnace\nprojects the imposed thermal boundary conditions. An example of a linear thermal gradient is shown in Figure 5.\nThis thermal gradient is necessary for the growth of crystals via directional solidification. The wall temperature\ngradient in the region of interest 16 cm < z _ 25 cm is approximately the same as that of the centerline (20 \xc2\xb0C/cm)\nThe growth of crystals by physical vapor transport necessitates a thermal profile with a "hump" shown in Figure 6.\nThis case illustrates that maximum deviation of the thermal gradient occurs in the region of the "hump", 20cm <\nz < 28 cm. The centerline temperature gradient for that region is 17\xc2\xb0C/cm, whereas the average wall gradient is\n3l\xc2\xb0C/cm. As we had discussed earlier, some applications necessitate localized heat transfer in one direction, the\nmultiple gradient shown in Figure 7 is an alternative for obtaining the same effect as insulation while preserving\nthe transparency of the furnace.

To show the response of the furnace under load\nconditions, we use the same condition as shown in Figure 5 for the linear thermal gradient.\nNote that the presence\nof an ampoule damps convective flows in the furnace.\nFigure 8 shows the measured thermal profile on the surface\nof an ampoule, 1.7 cm diameter and length 35.0 cm, containing\nlead bromide with a melting point of 373 o C.\nComparison\nof the location of the solid-liquid\ninterface to that indicated by the thermal profile shows reasonable\nagreement.\nThis provides a calibration\npoint for our thermal profile measurements.\nThe result indicates that the\ncontrol system accounts for thermal load conditions.\nThus the thermal gradient projected by the furnace under no\nload conditions\nmeasured at the centerline corresponds to the surface input temperature\nat the ampoule wall. This\nimplies that predetermined\nboundary conditions can be used as input to the furnace to study the dynamics of crystal\ngrowth. The ability of the self-tuning\ncontrol system of the furnace to tailor thermal profiles represents an\ninnovative concept that will find commercial\napplications\nfor optimizing\ncrystal growth conditions.\n\nZ-1f450\n\n600\n\nZ-2q450\n\nZ-3f350\n\nZ-4f245\n\nZ-5,245\n\nZ-8,246\n\nZ-7,246\n\nZ-8,245\n\n676\n66O\n625\n600\n476\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n1-\n\n/\n\n..........\n\nAmp-right\nFurn cent e\xc2\xa2\n\n......\n\nAn_-left\n\n....\n.....\n\n375\n\nAmp- rear\nAn_o- front\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nJ\n\nObserved Inter flee\n\n395\n30O\n275\n250\n225\n\n0\n\ns\n\n_o\n\n_5\n\n20\n\n2s\nz,\n\nLocstion\n\n30\n\n36\n\n40\n\n46\n\n6o\n\n66\n\n[om)\n\nFigure 8 - Comparison of projected temperature\nprofile under load conditions due to presence of ampoule filled\nwith lead bromide, to no load conditions\nrepresented by centerline profile of the solid curve, dT/dz = 20\xc2\xb0C/cm\n16cm < z < 25cm.

The self-tuning control accounts\ncontrol system adjusts for thermal load, thus thermal profiles can be\n\nmultizone furnace which uses a self-tuning\ngrowth. This furnace operates in the\nfor zone to zone thermal interactions.\nThe\ntailored prior to crystal growth and thermal\n\ngradients in the range of 2 \xc2\xb0C/cm to 45\xc2\xb0C/cm\ncan be obtained.\nThe operation of the furnace is based on the set-up\nof eight discrete temperatures\nover eight zones which result in a functional combination\nof heat flux distribution\nwhose response\n\nis quantified\n\nfrom temperature\n\nprofile measurements.\n\n10\n\nThe combination\n\nof the temperature\n\nprofiles\n\nfora given\nset-point\ntemperature\nis shown\ntogivetemperature\nprofiles\n\nfor the growth\n\nof\n\ncrystals.\nThese profiles include a range of thermal gradients for directional solidification\napplications,\ngrowth\nvapor transport techniques,\nas well as multiple gradient applications.\nThe innovation of the multizone crystal\ngrowth furnace is suited for crystal growth of a wide class of materials including, acousto-optic\noptoelectronics,\n\nby\n\nphotonics, low temperature\ntransparency\nand its ability\n\nsemiconductors\nand organic\nmaterials.\nto deliver precise thermal profiles.\n5.0\n\nof technological\n\nThe hallmark\n\ninterest\n\nof this furnace\n\ntechnology\n\nis its\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge\nthe support of the Commercial Technology Office at NASA Lewis Research Center\nthrough Gary A.P.
