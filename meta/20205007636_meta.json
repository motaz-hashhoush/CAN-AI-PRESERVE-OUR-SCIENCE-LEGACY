Both fields focus on understanding the processes which form and sculpt planets through time, yet there has been less scientific exchange between the two communities than is ideal. I will report on our white paper which explores\nsome of the institutional and cultural barriers impeding cross-discipline collaborations. Our suggestions for fostering greater collaboration between the disciplines will be described. Some solutions require structural or policy changes within NASA itself, while others are directed towards other institutions, including academic publishers, that can also facilitate\ngreater interdisciplinarity.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20205007636, "endDate": "2020-10-30T07:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "4a2951f82ac556ae8fbdafdfb8996b78", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronomical Society", "location": "Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "9628fe98f0af42d281471324077069ce", "id": "64107213ab594fd6b3adca174b9bc6a1"}], "name": "DPS2020. 52nd Annual Meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences", "location": "Virtual Meeting", "id": "9628fe98f0af42d281471324077069ce", "url": "https://aas.org/meetings/dps52#:~:text=The%20AAS%20Division%20for%20Planetary,Talks%20and%20Live%20Panel%20Discussions", "startDate": "2020-10-26T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20205007636-Marley-DPS2020-oral presentation-cOASIS, The Online Abstract Submission System.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205007636/downloads/20205007636-Marley-DPS2020-oral%20presentation-cOASIS%2C%20The%20Online%20Abstract%20Submission%20System.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205007636/downloads/20205007636-Marley-DPS2020-oral%20presentation-cOASIS%2C%20The%20Online%20Abstract%20Submission%20System.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205007636/downloads/20205007636-Marley-DPS2020-oral%20presentation-cOASIS%2C%20The%20Online%20Abstract%20Submission%20System.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
