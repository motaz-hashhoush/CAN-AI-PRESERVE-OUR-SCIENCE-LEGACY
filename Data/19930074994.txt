These tasks include selected\nmeasures in de:s.i.gn definition and review, reliability analysis, interfaces with other assurance\nactivities and control of general design practices, and problem correction and prevention.\nThis Chapter describes the reliability engineering task requirements.\n1A301 DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS\n1. The contractor shall generate a design specification for each item of hardware at the\nsystem, subsystem, and component level. Each design specification shall state the\nphysical and functional requirements seen by the envelope of the item being specified;\nand this statement of requirements shall be the best estimate available at the stage of\nproject life at which the specification is generated or revised. These specifications shall\ndescribe requirements for the item in question, as well as its interfaces with other items\n(including GFP) and shall include:\na. Functional (performance) and environmental requirements;\nb. Test requirements, including qualification stress levels requirements and test\nquantities;\nc. Safety margins, derating factors, apportioned reliability goal, and unacceptable failure\neffects (from a criticality standpoint);\nd. Physical parameters and constraints;\ne. Fault tolerance criteria; and\nf. Testability/diagnostic requirements.\nDesign specifications will initially be generated early in the functional design process and\nwill be iteratively updated to reflect refinements and changes during the evolution of the\ndesign. These documents will provide a consistent recorded basis for guiding the design\nof the system and its elements throughout the design evolution process.\n2. The contractor\'s reliability organization, in conjunction with other contractor\norganizations, shall review for concurrence all design specifications or shall ensure that\nthey are independently reviewed prior to their release. This review shall ensure that the\nset of specifications covers all items of hardware and software at the appropriate levels,\ntfiat each is complete in its contents, and that each is functionally and physically\nconsistent with interfacing design specifications, and that the resultant documentation\nchanges from updating comply with the project configuration management requirements.\nThese reviews shall also be conducted whenever individual specifications change; they\nshall be documented individually as they occur and shall be summarized at milestones (or\nperiodically) on an overall basis. The documentation of individual design specification\nreviews shall be used as inputs at design reviews of components and subsystems, and the\n\n3-1\n\noverall summaries shall be used as inputs at subsystems and system level design reviews\nand in program status reporting.\n3. Design specifications and their revisions shall be subject to NASA action as specified in\nthe contract.\n1A302 STANDARDIZATION OF DESIGN PRACTICES\n1. The contractor shall maintain a continuous effort to standardize and control design\n\npractices and fabrication processes. The contractor\'s existing design and process\nstandards and specifications shall be used insofar as practicable, modifying them as\nnecessary to meet the reliability, quality, and other requirements of the contract. To the\nextent prescribed in the contract, NASA design or processing standards shall be\nincorporated in the contractor\'s design standards system and the contractor shall impose a\nsimilar requirement on appropriate suppliers. The contractor\'s reliability or other\nassurance organization shall be responsible for reviewing design and process standards to\nbe used for the contract effort to ascertain their adequacy in meeting assurance\nrequirements of the contract.\n2. The contractor shall review for adequacy the standards and design practices applicable to\nthe contract effort of all suppliers required to utilize a reliability program (see par.\n1A201-2d). All standards and practices (including process specifications) ~shall be\nsubject to action by NASA (e.g., approval or review, and control of changes) as specified\nin the contract.\n1A303 RELIABILITY PREDICITON\n1. DEVELOPMENT OF RELIABILITY PREDICTIONS. Starting in the conceptual design\n\nstage, the contractor shall develop reliability prediction models and predictions for the\nsystem. These models and predictions shall reflect applicable experience from previous\nspace or aeronautical programs and shall be revised as required by design evolution and\nas additional pertinent data become available. Predictions shall be performed in close\ncoordination with failure mode and effects analyses (FMEA~s) on the same system\nelements. The scale of effort and degree of precision in each prediction shall be\nappropriate to the phase of project life in which the prediction is made and to the\nintended use of the results. Individual predictions shall be made and the results reported\nto users within the contractor\'s organization in time for the uses and decisions which\neach prediction is to support. Final predictions, if required, shall utilize data from the\nelectrical, mechanical, and thermal analyses prepared in accordance with pars. 1A305 and\n1A313. Predictions are variously useful as a basis for:\na. Comparing predicted reliability against apportioned reliability goals within the\nsystem and planning a design capable of meeting mission reliability goals.\nb. Timely identification of potential reliability problem areas and guiding design\ntradeoffs and redundancy decisions.\nc. Mission planning, test program planning, and reliability evaluation program planning.\n\n3-2\n\nd.

These diagrams shall be updated with the analyses they support as\nprescribed in Appendix B.\n1A304 FAILURE MODE AND EFFECTS ANALYSES (FMEA\'s)\n1. As an integral part of the early design phase, the contractor shall develop analyses to\ndetermine possible modes of failure and their effects on mission objectives and crew\nsafety. The primary objective of these analyses shall be to identify critical and\ncatastrophic failure modes to enable removal from the system of susceptibility to such\nfailures or their effects. Catastrophic failures are defined as those that result in loss of\nlife or mission or serious injury to personnel. Critical failures are defined as those that\nsignificantly degrade the achievement of mission success. The analysis shall be\nperformed for all mission hardware.\n\n2. The failure mode and effects analyses shall be conducted at the system-to-subsystem,\nsubsystem-to-component, and the system-to-instrument interfaces as well as interfaces\nwith ground test equipment.

Analysis of redundant equipment shall\naddress particularly any single failures that adversely affect the redundant capability of\ncross strapped, alternate path, or other redundant designs. The analysis shall also be\ndirected to identify any single failure that could prevent the successful removal of power\nfrom a payload instrument. All single failure points and potential critical and\ncatastrophic failures that cannot be eliminated from the system shall be itemized on a\nCritical Items List (CIL) for appropriate attention in corrective and risk management\nactivities. Existence of redundancy shall not preclude listing of a critical item on the CIL.\nJustification for the retention of the risk residual in each item on the list shall be included.\nThis list shall be subject to NASA action as required in Appendix B.\n3. FMEA results shall be communicated in a timely manner for prompt action by design\norganizations and project management. They shall be a major consideration in design\nand management reviews and shall provide criteria and data for other types of analysis,\ndesign improvement, testing, and safe operations. Some important applications include:\n3-3\n\na. Determining need for redundancy, fail-safe design features, and/or further derating.\nb. Supporting systems safety analyses and hazard analyses.\nc.

This shall be accomplished by\na project test program conducted in parallel with reliability ~:;s~::;::;ments which will include\nuse of the test results. The reliability evaluation program shall be designed to produce\nobjective data necessary for assessing the degree of system conformance to mission\nrequirements and contractual reliability requirements. Although the contractor\'s reliability\norganization may not have primary responsibility for testing, it shall be responsible for the\noverall reliability evaluation program and for ensuring that the test program provides data\nand visibility in a timely manner for effective reliability evaluation at appropriate levels of\nassembly.\n1A401 RELIABILITY EVALUATION PLAN\n\n1. As a separate section to the Reliability Program Plan, or as a subsidiary document, the\ncontractor shall submit a plan of the reliability evaluation program. This shall include an\noutline and milestone schedule of the project testing program (as defined in the project\ntest plan) shown in relation to the technical requirements for reliability assessment and to\nassessment schedules.\n2.

QUALIFICATION OF HARDWARE.\na. General. All elements of the system hardware in their mission configuration shall be\nqualified at appropriate levels of assembly to ensure the capability of each design to\nperform its required design functions. Qualification shall be accomplished by test\nand/or similarity. However, in cases where specified environments cannot be\nsimulated in test, analysis in combination with test may be used. Qualification\nrequirements shall be established on the basis of specification requirements for_ the\nitem being qualified. Levels of stress appropriate for each environmental and\nperformance parameter shall be selected to characterize the capability of the hardware\ndesign being qualified. Levels of assembly at which qualification testing is required\nand a consistent rationale (project rules) for assigning necessary levels of stress above\nlevels prescribed in the design specifications (see par. 1A301) shall be documented\nin the project test plan and/or the Reliability Evaluation Plan. For any component or\nhigher level item which is not required to undergo qualification testing, the Reliability\nEvaluation Plan (or project test plan) shall document or reference documentation of\ntlte technical justification for eliminating (or relaxing) the qualification test\nrequirements and shall provide a qualitative evaluation of the risks assumed.\nWhile qualification at a higher level of assembly along with other available data may\nbe considered a justifiable project risk-acceptance rationale for omitting qualification\nof some lower level items within that assembly, this does not constitute qualification\nof those lower level items. The contractor shall prepare and maintain a Qualification\n\n4-2\n\nStatus List as required in Appendix B, which states the basis for qualification and the\ncurrent qualification status of each component and subsystem. The contractor shall\nalso maintain appropriate documentation supporting qualification.\nb. Parts and Materials Qualification. Qualification shall be in accordance with the parts\nand materials program requirements referenced in the Statement of Work.\nRequirements shall be based on specifications prepared for each item rather than on\nmi<:~ion application.\nc. Components Qualification. Qualification at this level shall be based on componentlevel specifications responsive to mission requirements, including safety\nmargins/factors.\nd. Subsystems Qualification. Qualification at the subsystem level shall be conducted\nwhere practicable in consideration of the nature of the particular subsystem and the\noverall risk assessment philosophy of the project test plan.\nQualification\nrequirements shall be based on the subsystem specification with appropriate safety\nma:tgins/factors. They shall at least verify the physical and functional adequacy of\ninterfaces between components.\ne. Systems Qualification. Qualification requirements shall be based on the system\nspecification, with appropriate safety margins/factors. Qualification at this level shall\ninclude tests simulating mission environments and conditions, including safety\nmargins/factors, to the degree practicable. Qualification will include application of\ntest results at lower levels of assembly and evaluation of all system operational modes\nand interfaces.\n3. TEST SPECIFICATIONS, PROCEDURES, AND REPORTS. The contractor shall\nprepare a test specification, a test procedure, and a test report for each test (or series of\nidentical tests) in the testing program and shall be responsible for the adequacy of those\ngenerated as a part of test programs of suppliers required to use a reliability program (see\npar. 1A201-2d). All test specifications and procedures shall conform to detailed\nrequirements stated in NHB 5300.4(1B) pars. 1B702, 1B703, and 1B704 and shall be\nsubject to NASA actions as specified in the contract.

Where requiredy life tests at the component and higher levels will be\nconducted as prescribed by the contract and will be specifically described in the\nReliability Evaluation Plan.\n5. CONTROL OF UNSCHEDULED ACTIVITIES DURING TEST. The contractor shall\nestablish a procedure for controlling, documenting, and approving all test activities that\ndeviate from an approved test procedure. Where problems encountered during test make\nsuch changes necessary, the control procedure shall inclqde a requirement for change\napproval from the same organizations that originally had authority to approve the\xc2\xb7 test\nprocedure; NASA approved test procedures require NASA approval of the changes by a\ncontractually defined process. NASA participation in change of test procedures that were\noriginally subject to NASA review shall also be defined contractually. The contractor\nshall be alert to the hazard potential of last-minute changes and shall institute controls at\nappropriate management levels for preventing accident or injury or hardware damage.\nSuch control shall include appropriate real-time decision making mechanisms to expedite\n4-3\n\ncontinuation (or suspension) of testing after malfunction, with documented rationale.\nThe control procedure shall be contained in the Reliability Program Plan or project test\nplan and shall be referenced in each test procedure.\n1A403 RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT\nAt milestones specified in the ~diability Program Plan, the contractor shall assess system\nreliability. These assessments shall utilize test results, mathematical analyses, and\nengineering analyses as appropriate to meet current requirements. Assessments shall\nconsider the qualification status of each component, subsystem, and system as well as\nappropriate revision of failure modes and effects analyses (see par. 1A304) and reliability\npredictions (see par. 1A303) as necessary to provide an adequate current assessment of\nsystem reliability.\n1A404 RELIABILITY INPUTS TO READINESS REVIEWS\nThe reliability organization shall ensure that all pertinent reliability data necessary to support\neach project milestone or readiness review is provided in complete form and in a timely\nmanner. This shall include all pertinent data on supplier-furnished articles which are a part\nof the specific hardware assembly to which the readiness review pertains.\n1A405 RELIABILITY EVALUATION PROGRAM REVIEWS\nAt appropriate milestones scheduled in the Reliability Program Plan, the contractor shall\nreview the reliability evaluation effort (see par. 1A401). This review shall be conducted as a\npart of the contractor\'s overall reliability program review activity prescribed in par. 1A202-2.\nIn these reviews of reliability evaluation effort, pertinent tests results will be examined to\ndetermine the need for revisions to the Reliability Evaluation Plan and/or to confirm that\ncompleted portions of the reliability evaluation effort have adequately accomplished their\nrequired purpose. After each review, the contractor will provide the procuring NASA\ninstallation a written report of results of the review including actions to be taken,\nresponsibility therefor, and revisions to the Reliability Evaluation Plan. Results of these\nreviews will also be considered and acted upon in contractor-NASA reliability program\nmanagement meetings (see par. 1A203-1).\n\n4-4\n\nAPPENDIX A: INTERFACING AREAS OF RELIABILITY PROGRAMS WITH\nOTHER ASSURANCE PROGRAMS FOR NASA CONTRACTS\n\nA number of the provisions in this document overlap those in NHB 5300.4(1B) "Quality\nProgram Provisions for Aeronautical and Space System Contractors," and others require\ncomplementary or interfacing program provisions.

A combination of parts, devices and structure, usually self-contained, _which\nperforms a distinctive function in the c,penuion of the overall equipment. A "black box"\n(e.g., transmitter, encoder, cryogenic pump, star tracker).\nCRITICAL GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. Critical ground support equipment is\ndefined as that mission peculiar ground support equipment that interfaces with the flight\nsystem in any way which, through its malfunction, can damage or functionally impair the\nflight system.\nDESIGN SPECIFICATION. Generic designation for a specification which describes\nfunctional and physical requirements for an article, usually at the component level or higher\nlevels of assembly. In its initial form, the design specification is a statement of functional\nrequirements with only general coverage of physical and test requirements. The design\nspecification evolves through the project life cycle to reflect progressive refinements in\nperformance, design, configuration, and test requirements. In many projects the end item\nspecifications serve all the purposes of design specifications for the contract end-items; for\narticles not designated contractually as end-items, design specifications provide the basis for\ntechnical and engineering management control.\nDESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE. An individual (such as a NASA plant representative), firm (such as an evaluation contractor), DoD plant representative, or other Government\nrepresentative designated and authorized by NASA to perform a specific function(s) for\nNASA. As related to the contractor\'s reliability effort, this might include evaluation,\nassessment, design review participation, and/or approval/review of certain documents or\nactions. (However, NASA approval or review authority will not be delegated to nonGovernment organizations.)\nFAILURE MODE AND EFFECTS ANALYSIS. Study of a system and working\ninterrelationships of its elements to determine ways in which failures can occur (failure\nmodes) and the effects of each potential failure on the system element in which it occurs, on\nother system elements, and on the success of the system\'s mission.\nMAINTAINABILITY. The quality of the combined features of equipment design and\ninstallation which facilitates the accomplishment of inspection, test, checkout, servicing,\nrepair, and overhaul necessary to meet operational objectives with a minimum of time, skill,\nand resources in the planned maintenance environments.\nMILESTONE. Any significant event in the project life cycle or in the associated reliability\nprogram which is used as a control point for measurement of progress and effectiveness or\nfor planning or redirecting future effort.\n\nC-1\n\nMISSION SYSTEM. The mission system comprises the flight hardware and software, the\nflight support equipment, mission unique ground operating equipment, and mission\noperations software.\nNONCONFORMANCE. A condition of any article or material, or service in which one or\nmore characteristics do not conform to requirements. Includes failures, discrepancies,\ndeficiencies, defects, and malfunctions.\nPART. One piece or two or more pieces joined together which are not normally subject to\ndisassembly without destruction of design use.\nQUALIFICATION. Determination that an article or material, with its associated software, is\ncapable of meeting all prescribed design and performance requirements as stated in pertinent\nspecifications.\nOUALIFICATION TEST. A test or series of tests conducted to determine whether an article\nor material, with its associated software, meets qualification requirements.\nREDUNDANCY (OF DESIGN). The use of more than one means of accomplishing a given\nfunction where more than one must fail before the article fails to perform.\nRELIABILITY. A characteristic of a system, or any element thereof, expressed as a\nprobability that it will perform its required functions under defined conditions at designated\ntimes for specified operating periods.\nRELIABILITY APPORTIONMENT. The assignment of reliability subgoals to subsystems\nand elements thereof within a system whfch will result in meeting the overall reliability goal\nfor the system if each of these subgoals is attained.\nRELIABILITY ASSESSMENT. An evaluation of reliability of a system or portion thereof.\nSuch assessments usually employ mathematical_ modeling, directly applicable results of tests\non system hardware, estimated reliability figures, and nonstatistical engineering estimates to\nensure that all known potential sources of unreliability have been evaluated.\nRELIABILITY DEMONSTRATION.\nStatistically designed testing, with specified\nconfidence level, to demonstrate the degree to which a system or element thereof meets the\nestablished reliability requirement.\nRELIABILITY PREDICTION. An analytical prediction of numerical reliability of a system\nor element thereof similar to a reliability assessment except that the prediction is alway\xc2\xb7s\nquantitative and is normally made in the earlier design stages where very little directly\napplicable test data are available.\nSINGLE FAILURE POINT. A single element of hardware, the failure of which would result\nin loss of objectives, hardware, or crew, as defined for the specific application and/or project\nfor which the single failure point analysis is performed.\n\nC-2\n\nSOFrWARE. The computer programs and their governing documents associated with the\ndesign, handling, test, and use of the mission hardware.\nSUBCONTRACT. A contract or purchase order entered into under a Government prime\ncontract by a supplier. May include orders issued to activities or subdivisions within the\ncontractor\'s organization.\nSUPPLIER. A subcontractor, at any tier, performing the contract services or producing the\ncontract articles for the contractor.\n\nSYSTEM. One of the principal functioning entities comprising the project hardware,\nsoftware, and related operational services within a project or flight mission. Ordinarily, a\nsystem is the first major subdivision of project work. Similarly, a subsystem is a major\nfunctioning entity within a system. (A system may also be an organized and disciplined\napproach to accomplish a task, e.g., failure reporting system.)\n\nC-3\n\nAPPENDIX D: REQUIREMENT DETAILS TO BE SPECIFIED IN THE RFP OR\nCONTRACT\n\nIt is intended that individual projects tailor the requirements of this document to justifiable\nproject needs.
