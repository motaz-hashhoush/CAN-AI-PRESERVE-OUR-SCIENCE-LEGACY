If these are due to strongly magnetized neutron stars then we expect them to be associated with the galactic disk with a scale height of about 500 pc as expected for old neutron stars. The simplest way to test this hypothesis would be to test for a concentration along galactic latitude /b/ = 0. We got a marginal indication of such a concentration, and the probability that the 16 events are isotropically distributed is 0.02. We also show that this result is not in conflict with the present BATSE data set.", "title": "A possible galactic association of bursts showing cyclotron lines", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T01:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930056093, "meta": {"author": {"name": "De Jager, O.
