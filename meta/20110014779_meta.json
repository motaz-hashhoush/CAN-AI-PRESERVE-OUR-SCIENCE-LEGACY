The development of this algorithm was prompted by the need, heretofore not satisfied, for a means of entering real-world binary data into a quantum computer. The data format provided by this algorithm is suitable for subsequent ultrafast quantum processing of the entered data. Potential applications lie in disciplines (e.g., genomics) in which one needs to search for matches between parts of very long sequences of data. For example, the algorithm could be used to encode the N-bit-long human genome in only log2N qubits. The resulting log2N-qubit state could then be used for subsequent quantum data processing - for example, to perform rapid comparisons of sequences.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110014779, "id": "dc6d3b7b0d3a4d49b033760c807fa99e", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, March 2005", "publicationDate": "2005-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20110014753, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, March 2005", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110014779.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110014779/downloads/20110014779.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110014779/downloads/20110014779.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110014779/downloads/20110014779.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
