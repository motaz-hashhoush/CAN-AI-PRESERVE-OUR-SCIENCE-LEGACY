The cylinder\nis equipped with a differential pressure transducer (0.034.1 cm or 13.5 in H 2 0 column range), an amplifier\nwith a signal output of 0.0 to 5.0 VDC corresponding\nto the transducer range, and cabling to integrate the\npressure reference cylinder with a signal readout unit\n(with power supply) located outside the compartment\ntested. The signal readout unit provides a 28 VDC\ninput power to the differential pressure transducer\nand millivolt digital readout of the amplifier output.\n\nThe pressure reference cylinder is pressurized to 1.37\nx iO N/rn 2 (5.2 psig), placed within the compartment\nto be tested, and integrated with the signal readout\nunit. An electrical pass-through is provided in the wall\nof the compartment under test (or a test closure assembly\nin some test configurations) to permit integration of the\nsystem. The compartment under test is then closed and\npressurized until the signal output of the pressure reference cylinder transducer indicates 13 cm (5 in) H20\ncolumn differential between cylinder and compartment\npressures. Gas flow to the compartment, at this time, is\nreduced to a specified leakage value. An increase or\ndecrease in compartment pressure, with respect to the\ncylinder reference pressure, serves as an indication of\nwhether the compartment leakage is less than or exceeds,\nrespectively, the maximum allowable specification value.\n(continued overlea')\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration, Neither the United States\t\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States \t\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nThe flow is then varied until signal output indicates a\nstabilized condition of 13 cm H 2 0 column pressure\ndifferential between the cylinder and compartment. The\ndelivery flow rate at this time is a directly readable parameter and is equal to the compartment leak rate.\nSince the gases within the cylinder and compartment\nundergo essentially the same temperature transients,\nthe effects of temperature changes on test result accuracies and on the ease of balancing flows are significantly reduced. Application of this test method has\ndemonstrated a system sensitivity which responds, within 15 minutes, to changes in the delivery flow into a\nvolume of 47.6m 3 (1700 ft. 3 ) that are as small as 150\nstd. cm3/sec.\nNotes:\n1. Information concerning this innovation may be of\ninterest to manufacturers of holding tanks, tank cars,\nprocessing vessels used for handling hazardous materials and aircraft and ship pressurized compartments.\n\nB72-10576\t\n\n2.
