b'Engineering Challenges for Active Debris Removal\nJ.-C.

A 2009 analysis by the NASA Orbital\nDebris Program Office shows that, in order to maintain the LEO debris population at a\nconstant level for the next 200 years, an active debris removal of about five objects per\nyear is needed. The targets identified for removal are those with the highest mass and\ncollision probability products in the environment. Many of these objects are spent upper\nstages with masses ranging from 1 to more than 8 metric tons, residing in several\naltitude regions and concentrated in about 10 inclination bands. To remove five of those\nobjects on a yearly basis, in a cost-effective manner, represents many challenges in\nengineering, technology development, and operations. This paper outlines a conceptual\nend-to-end debris removal operation, including launch, precision tracking, rendezvous,\nstabilization (of the tumbling targets), capture, and deorbit of the targets; and highlights\nmajor challenges associated with the operations. Pros and cons of several proposed\nremoval techniques are also evaluated.\n\n'
