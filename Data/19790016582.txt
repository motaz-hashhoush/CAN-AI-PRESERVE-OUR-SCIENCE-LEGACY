Simple examples are given to illustrate the effect of\nrelativity on measurements of time and frequency in the near-earth\nenvironment.\n\nI.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs almost everybody knows, next Brch 14th is the 100th\nArmiversary of the birth of Albert Einstein, and so many\ncelebrations and symposia are planned for 1979 that I fear\nall will become violently ill from an overdose of relativity\nwell before mid year. For now, I would like to distill some\nof the salient aspects of both the special and the general\ntheories of relativity and to relate them to clocks and\nfrequency standards. After describing the basic concepts\nof special and general relativity, I\'ll discuss the size of\nthe relativistic effects near the earth and the level 0 5\ntheir experimental verification to indicate how well one\nmight be able to rely cn general relativity.\n11.\n\nSpecial Relativity\n\nSpecial relativity is partly concerned with the perceptions of observers viewing rods and clocks in uniform motion\nnot accelerating with respect\nrelative to one another ( a d\nto some "absolute" inertial frame which we won\'t worry about\nhere). A key idea in Eins din\'s development of this theory\ninvolves the concept of simultaneity. If, as Newton assumed,\nthere was a universal time coordinate that applied throughout all space, then there is no problem in our agreeing on\na definition of the simultaneity of two events: We simply\ncompare the readings of our "universal" clock. If the readings are the same at each event place, we agree that those\nevents took place simultaneously.\nIf there is a spatial coincidence between two points,\nthen there\'s again no problem agreeing on\na de _nition\nof simultaneity because the points are co-located. We can\nuse the s a w watch at the same place to see whether the\nevents o;cur at the same time. That\'s no problem, with or\nwithout a universal time.\nIf there were spatial separation between two events,\nand if we could communicate between those two separate spatial points with infinite speed, then again, we\'d all agree\nthere w m l d be no problem in deciding whether or not the\nevents were simultaneous.\n\nHowever, if we have spatial separation and the communication speed is limited by the speed of light, as Einstein\nthought, then, thexe is a problem. The definition of simultaneity is no longer intuitively obvious. In fact, as a\nsimple, down to earth, exainple can show, even with a rea-\n\nsonable definition, there is not necessarily agreement on\nsimultaneity among observers moving relative to one another.\nNow, let us define simultaneity for events at spatially\nseparated points with communication between them possible\nvia light signals. Concentrate for a moment on some given\nframe (Figure 1)\n\n.\n\nFi q*fle 1\nAkj\n\nf;f;*jiQ\n\nfrbb,e\nP\nC\n\nWe\'re concerned about whether or not events that occur at\npoints A and B in this frame are simultaneous. We can go\nto the midpoint between these two points, a distance L from\nA and B, and we can say that when an observer at point A\nsees an event hc or she (hereafter "he" for economy) immediately transmits a light signal toward 0 and when the observer at pcint B sees an event he also immediately transmits\na light signal to 0. If these two light signals arrive at\n0 simulraneously, then we say that the events A and B occurred simultaneously. That\'s a reasonable definition of\nsimultaneity.\nNow suppose we have two frames in relative motion.\nConsider, in particular, a down to earth example: the\nground and a train (Figure 2).\n\n(Any who know m f l y i n g h a b i t s , know t h a t I have a s p e c i a l\ny\ns p o t i n m h e a r t f o r t r a i n s even though t h e y d o t e n d t o r u n\ny\na b i t l a t e . ) L e t u s s i n g l e o u t two p o i n t s , A and B , on t h e\nground, and s e t an o b s e r v e r halfway between.

The ratio of\nthe two intervals is given by the Lorentz factor:\n\nSimiis7:ly, since these are symmetric situations, if the clock\nk*l b t e h in S f and the observer in S* were to measure the interval between two ticks, L similar relation would be obtained:\n\nThe point is that, with the clock in S*, one is actually comparing it to a series of (identical) clocks distributed in\nS which the clock in S* passes as it moves with respect to\nS; similarly, with the clock in S: it moves with respect\nto the fixed (identical) clocks in S*. There is no paradox\nin the relationship being symmetric. One may conclude from\nthis analysis that a clock always appears to run fastest in\nits own frame. When an observer is at rest with respect to\nthe clock, he thinks the clock is running faster than when\nduiom\nmotion with respect to that clock. This efhe i : n f r\nfect has been verified very well in the measurement of the\nlifetime of unstable elementary particles. Such particles\nin cosmic rays, and in accelerators, often move with velocities v very close to c, and this lifetime enhancement factor\ncan tEen be very large because the Lorentz factor tends to\nzero and its inverse to infinity. Studies of mu-mesons have\nverified this effect with very high accuracy.\n111.\n\nGeneral Relativity\n\nThe theory of relativity we just $.iscussed is special\nin the sense of being restricted. It is silent on the subject of gravitation, it is concerned primarily with physics\nin (inertial) frames moving unifomly with respect to one\nanother. Einstein felt that concern was not sufficient; he\n\nwanted to introduce gravitation. Einstein was unhappy with\n::awtonls theory of gravitation which had existed unchallenged\nfor about two centuries. Newton\'s theory did, of course,\nhave one small problem. There was a minute, but annoying,\ndiscrepancy between the observations and the theory which became noticeable in the late 1850\'s and was quite well established by the gerly 1900\'s. Einstein was not upset about\nNewton\'s theory,because of a mere disagreement with observations; his concern was a matter of principle.\nEinstein did not accept Newton\'s theory because it implied action at a distance. In this theory, the force felt\nby body A due to body B depended on the location of body B\nat the very instant that body A felt the force. But if no\nsignal can travel faster than the speed of light, how is\nbody A to know where body B was located at that instant?\nThis aspect was a severe drawback to Newton\'s theory in Einstein\'s mind and he set about the development of an alternaLive. The process took about a decade. The main principle\nupon which he based this general theory of relativity is the\nso-called "principle of equivalence".\nOne can state this principle in various ways. A usual\nway is to state that the effect of a gravitational field\nlocally is indistinguishable from an inertial acceleration.\nThe example usually given is that of an "Einstein elevator".\nSuppose a laboratory is enclosed in an opaque small elevator\nand placed in a gzavitational field, such as on the surface\nof the earth. The scientists inside feel the force of gravity but cannot unequivocally identify it as such. They may\ndo any physics experiments and obtain numerical results.\nHowever, suppose now the laboratory were taken away from the\nearth and accelerated uniformly with a rocket. If the scientists in the laboratory were to repeat all their experiments,\nthe principle of equivalence states that they will get exactly the same numerical answers, provided that the inertial\nacceleration is exactly equal to the gravitational acceleration.\nAnothcr statemer.t of the principle of equivalence can\nbe given in terms of the ratio of gravitational to inertial\ninass. Gravitational mass is the mass that appears on the\nright hand side of the equation that expresses Newton\'s law\nof gravity:\nGm P\nI\n~ = 3\n(6)\nr2\n\nwhere G is Newton\'s constant of gravitation, m is the\n(gravitational) mass of the body being acted ugon, M is the\n(gravitational) mass of the body attracting m , and 9 is the\ndistance between them. The inertial mass is qhe coeFficient\nof the acceleration,a, in Newton\'s law of motion:\n-\n\nThe ratio of these two masses, according to the principle, is\nindependerk of the composition of the bodies and independent\nof the mass of the bodies. It is a universal constant. This\nprinc\'?le, although not so named, was also accepted by Newton. In fact, he was the first to verify it quantitatively,\nachieving an accuracy of approximately 1 part in 1,000.\nWhat can we infer from this principle of equivalence?\nOne of the things Einstein inferred was that the trajectory\nof a particle could depend only on the geometry of space and\ntime. By the principle, the trajectory did not depend on the\nparticle itself, on its composition, or on its mass (except\nfor the "back reaction" which I ignore here). It doesn\'t\nmatter whether we have a pea, a flashlight, or whatever; it\nwill move on the same trajectory because it will be affected\nin the same way as any other mass. Thus, Einstein reasoned\nthat one could talk about the trajectories being mere1 a\nprcperty of the geometry, and having nothing to do wit{ the\nparticular object that was moving along the path.\nWhat determines the geometry? Einstein felt that the\ngeometry should be determined solely by the mass, or, more\nprecisely, the mass-energy, distribution in the universe.\nBut isn\'t it contradictory to say that the path of the particle doesn\'t depend on the particlz, only on the geometry,\nand that the geometry depends only on the mass distribution?\nCertainly the particle is part of the mass distribution.\nYes, but if one ccnsiders the particle to have an infinitesimally sma1.l mass, it won\'t affect the geometry, and to\nthat extent, these statements are consistent. But this\n"closed loop" aspect is a k e y to E i e ~ t ~ l n \'t 5 c c r f .\nh\nEinstein may have been guided in developing his "field\ntheory" for gravitation by analogy with Newtonian physics.\nIn Newtonian physics, one obtains the gravitational potential from the mass distribution. In other words, the gravitational potential everywhere in space is determined by the\nmass distribution. In fact, the potential, @, is determined\nby Poisson\'s Equation:\n\nwhere p is the mass density. Only the gravitational potential appears on the left side and only the mass (density) on\nthe right side. This equation is a linear, second-order,\npartial differential equation for @.Einstein in effect\ngeneralized this purely spatial expression, to an analogous\nspace-time expression that also allcwed the geometry to be\nnon-Euclidean. He used Riemannian geometry and developed\nan analogous equatior, where, on the right side, the mass density is replaced by the energy-momentum tensor:\n\nAs in the Newtonian case, only the right side contains the\n"mass" terms; only the left. side contzins the "geometry"\ndependence. Thz geometry here is defined in a metric space.\nThe so-called "metric tensor" g\nin essence expresses the\n"connection" between neighborin& points in this space-time:\n\nThe interval ds is the "distance" between two infinitesimally separated points in the space-time. To evaluate ds2, one\nsums over all values of the two indices p and v which run\nfrom 1 to 4 and correspond to the three spatial and the one\ntemporal dimension. In Cartesian coordinates, in Euclidean\nthree-dimensional space, ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2; Equation\n(10) is the generalization for a Riemannian metric space.\nEinstein made other ass-mptions,namely that this\nenergy-momentum tensor is a conserved quantity in a sense\nanalogous to the conservation of energy and momentum in Newtonian physics. Further, he limited the derivatives on the\nleft side to second-order derivatives of g , in analogy to\nthe second-order derivatives on the left sY8e of the Newtonian equation (8). With those assumptions, one can uniquely\ndetermine the left side up to a term proportional to the\nmetric tensor. The coefficient of this term, the so-called\ncosmological constant, Einstein first took to be zero, a\nposition he deviated from later when he thought the universe\nwas static; still later, he greatly regretted this temporary\ndeviation. (It is now generally assumed that the cosmological constant is zero.)\n\nBecause of symmetry (T = T U ) , Equation (9) represents\nonly 10 independent equatioHY, nog 16. These .are Einstein I s\nfield equations which he used as the basis for calculations.\nIn Newtonian Physics, the field equations were not enough.\nEquation ( 8 ) indicates how the gr-vitational potential can\nbe determined, but it doesn\'t tell one how to calculate the\npaths of light rays and particles. In fact, Newton never\nsaid anything, as far as I know, ahout the effect of gravity\non light rays. As for the effect of gravity on massive objects,Newton had a separate assunption, his equally wellk : w law of motion, given in Equation (7). In relativity,\n!on\nthe corresponding equations are the equations for geodesics\nin four-dimensional space-time. A very intriguing aspect of\nthe general relativistic formulation is that a separate assumption for the equations of motion does not seem to be\nneeded; the equations of motion follow from the field equations therselves. The basic reason that makes this result\npossible, Zhough by no means guaranteed, is that the field\nequations of general relativity are non-linear. The Newtonian field equation, by contrast, is linear. The terns\nhidden in G\nin Equation (9) are, in fact, non-linear expressions iNvterms of the metric tensor g\nPV\n\n.\n\nMagnitude of Relativistic Effects\nWhat of the magnitude of the relativistic effects we\nmight expect? We know, as Einstein also knew, that Newtonian physics is a very good approximation, at least in our\nneighborhood. So the Newtonian equations must be, in some\nsense, the first approximation for the solution to the relativistic equations. Deviations from Newtonian physics \'appear in terms proportional to v2/c2 as we saw from the\nLorentz Transformation; in the general theory of relativity,\ndeviations appear in terms proportional to the factor,\nGM/c\'~. The quantity GM/C~ has the dimensions of length and\nis often denoted by r and called the gravitational radius\nof the body. We can gvaluate r near the sun, say, to de!\ntermine tkorder of magnitude o ? the relativistic effects\nthere that are due to gravitation. We find that, for the\n1.5 km; by contrast, the radius of the sun is\nsun, r\nabout ?00,000 km. Thus, we can expect relativistic effects\nto appear at the level of two parts per million.\n\n-\n\nWhat about effects near the earth, which are of more\nh\ndirect concern for us? We find that : e gravitational radius of the earth is near half a centimeter. In other words,\nthe earth would have to be compressed down to half a centimeter bef~reit would turn into a black hole. The radius of\nthe earth is about 6 x 10\' centimeters, so relativistic\n\neffects near the surface of the earth could be expected to\nbe on the order of eight parts per billion, not terribly\nlarge.\nLet us now try to describe the relativistic effects\nquantitatively. To solve the field equations to determine\nthe metric tensor g , is no easy job. There are very few\ncan be deterproblems that have BYen formulated where g\nmined in closed form. The most famous onevvsolved by\nSchwarzschild very shortly after Einstein published his\ntheory, is for a spherically-symmetric, static mass distribution. The solution exterior to that mass can be written\nas :\n\nwhere, as stated above, ds2 is the infinitesimal space-time\ninterval and where the non-vanishing components of the metric tensor are the coefficients -f dt2, dr2, etc. These\ncoeffic\'ents, as here, are often v.:rltten as a power series\nin GM/c 3r. In general relativity, the parameters, a, B , and\ny, don\'t appear; they are identically one. The higher-order\nterms, indicated by\ndo not appear either; they are\nidentically zero in general relativity. The reason for\nwriting the metric in this "generalized" form is to facilitate the testing of the theory. By a least-squares match\nof the predictions of the theory to the results of observations made, say, in the solar system, one can estimate the\nvalues of these parameters. If the estimates turn out to\nbe unity to within experimental uncertainty, we conclud\'e\nthat the observations are consistent with general relativity.\nIf they aren\'t, then general relativity is in trouble.\n\n"...",\n\nGiven the metric tensor and the equations of motion, one\ncan then calculate explicitly the paths of test particles and\nlight signals. The calculations are a bit intricate; one\ncannot in general obtain "closed-form" solutions. One often\nuses a perturbation expansion in powers of r /r where the\nfirst approximation repxesents the ~ewtonian~solution\nand\nthe next higher approximation, the so-called post-Newtonian\nsolution.\n\nV.\n\nSimple Examples of Relativistic Effects on\nFreauencv and Time\n\nLet us, finally, turn to the predicted relativistic\neffects on the frequency of light signals andonclocks. We\nwill treat first a very simple example to show how one can\nuse elementary reasoning to obtain an answer, without employing the full armamentarium of general relativity. We\'ll need\nonly to apply the principle of equivalence. Thus,.suppose we\nhave a transmitter and a receiver that are stationary but\nseparated. Let the receiver, or observer, be on the surface\nof the earth; let the transmitter, at an altitude H above\nthe observer, transmit a signal with frequency f (see Figure\n3 ) . The question is, "What frequency does the Ebserver measure?"\n\nAn easy way to answer this question is to use the\nprinciple of equivalence. The system, or laboratory, we set\nup is equivalent to another where we replace gravity by an\nacceleration: We accelerate the laboratory at a value a,\nequal in magnitude to the acceleration g of the earth\'sgravity. We keep the observer and transmitter separated by\nthe same distance H. At some instant, the transmitter sends\na signal which the observer receives a short time, At, later.\nLet the velocity of the observer, at the instant of reception of the signal, relative to his and the transmitter\'s\nvelocity, at the instant of transmission of the signal, be\ndv. The value of dv will be equal to the acceleration of the\nlaboratory multiplied by the time interval between transmission and reception. Thus, using the principle of equivalence,\n\nwhere At is just the time taken by light to travel the distance H (At = H/c), and where a = g. These are all approximate relations, valid to the first order in the small quantities. The frequency shift, A f 2 fO-f, of the observed\nf,\nfrequency relative to the transmitted frequency, - is like\na first-order Doppler shift and is given by\n\nwhere we have substituted from Equation (12). This change\nin frequency represents, in fact, a violet shift.\nThus, the transmitter, at altitude H, sends\nat frequency f and the observer receives a signal\nquency,greater by Af. We note that the change in\ntional potential between transmitter and receiver\nthe change in-GMe/Re, the gravitational potential\nearth:\n\na signal\nwith a fregravitais just\nfor-the\n\nwhere M and Rt are the mass and rai\'ius, respectively, of\nthe earfh; and BARe is equal to H. The fractional change,\nAf/f, in frequency and the accumulated difference, AT, in\napparent clock readings after elapsed time T are given by:\n\nIn other words, if the observer had a clock identical in construction to that governing the transmitter, avd if the observer knew the value of the transr\'tted frequency, as determined at the transmitter, by the clock there, the observer would infer that his clocli was losing time relative to\nthe clczk in the lower gravitational potential of the transmitter. Of course, this "relativistic" loss can easily be\ntaken into account in any comparison.\nLet us consider another example. Suppose a frequency\nstandard were in a circular orbit about the earth, and sup-\n\npose, i n c o r r e c t l y , t h a t t h e f i r s t - o r d e r Doppler s h i f t and\nt h e e a r t h \' s r o t a t i o n were n e g l i g i b l e .

With t h e\ncombination of t h e motion and\ngravitational potential\n\neffects, we would measure either a violet shift or a red\nshift, depending simply on the altitude of the satellite.\nWere we to observe from a lower potential, that is, from a\nposition higher above the earth than the satellite, we would\nshift.

It is clear in\nprinciple that at .\nsome level general relativity must "break\n_\ndown", because it is incompatible with quantum mechanics.\nNo one has yet been able to formulate a satisfactory quantum\ntheory of gravity, although there are some good ideas currently being explored. As one makes observations on a more\nmicroscopic scale, quantum mechanics plays an increasingly\nimportant role. At what length scale will quantum gravity\nactually be important? One answer is based on the evaluation of the "fundamental1\' length that can be formed from\nthe gravitational constant, the speed of light, and Planck\'s\nh,\nconstant, - which is a measure of the importance of quantum\nphenomena. This length is called the Pla~~ck\nlength and is\ngiven by:\n\nwhere,in accordance with convention, the "slash" on h denotes division by 2n. It is clear for present PTTI purposes\nthat one nee2 not worry about such length scales. It will\nbe a long time before anyone will conceive of practical experimental proc.=dures that will expose what happens at these\nlength scales. Quantum theories of gravity currently under\nstudy center on so-called "super gravity", which tries to\nunite general relativity and quantum mechanics in a "higher\nlevel" theory for which general relativity will be the appropriate macroscopic limit. Testing the validity of these\nideas is hopelessly beyond present experimental capabilities.\nIn the macroscopic world of the solar system, relativistic effects are very small. In addition, they have been\nverified by measurements to one percent or better. The relativistic effects of motion and gravity on clock rates, in\nparticular, have been verified to approximately one hundredth of one percent already. A relativistic effect on\ntrajectories, the prediciton of a non-Newtonian advance of\n\nt h e p e r i h e l i o n p o s i t i o n of Mercury\'s o r b i t , h a s been v e r i f i e d\nt o a b o u t h a l f a p e r c e n t , The p r e d i c t e d d e f l e c t i o n o f l i g h t\nr a y s , and t h e p r e d i c t e d i n c r e a s e i n echo d e l a y s , have been\nv e r i f i e d t o t h e o r d e r of one p e r c e n t , and a few t e n t h s of one\npercent, r e s ~ e c t i v e l y .\nT h e r e i s no problem, i n p r i n c i p l e , i n a p p l y i n g t h e gene r a l t h e o r y of r e l a t i v i t y t o t h e s o l a r s y s t e m , a n d , i n p a r t i c u l a r , t o t h e e a r t h environment a t a u s e f u l l e v e l of a c c u r acy.
