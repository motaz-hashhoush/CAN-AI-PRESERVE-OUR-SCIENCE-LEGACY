Variable capacity cycles including single-shaft and free-turbine engine configurations were analyzed to define an optimum engine design configuration. Parametric optimizations were made on cooled and uncooled rotor configurations. A detailed structural and heat transfer analysis was conducted to provide a 4000-hour life HP turbine with material properties of the 1988 time frame. A pivoted vane and a moveable sidewall geometry were analyzed. Cooling and variable geometry penalties were included in the cycle analysis. A variable geometry free-turbine engine configuration with a design 1477K (2200 F) inlet temperature and a compressor pressure ratio of 16:1 was selected. An uncooled HP radial turbine rotor with a moveable sidewall nozzle showed the highest performance potential for a time weighted duty cycle.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820021447, "id": "6ceb0acd3ffa40148b1903cce808e268", "publicationDate": "1981-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19820021447.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19820021447/downloads/19820021447.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19820021447/downloads/19820021447.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19820021447/downloads/19820021447.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
