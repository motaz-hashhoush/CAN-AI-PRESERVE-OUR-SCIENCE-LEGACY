Howes\nSUMMARY\n\n\'-\'>\n\'-\'>\nN\nI\n\nUJ\n\nMethods are discussed for distinguishing icebergs from ships utilizing airborne radar and microwave radiometry. Side-looking radar is\nappropriate for targets off the flight path whereas radiometry may be\nappropriate for targets along the flight path. The radar methods are\nclassified according to whether the target is resolved. Since targets\nof interest may be near or below the resolution threshold, methods\nwhich do not require target resolution are preferred. Among these methods, polarization techniques appear most feasible. Specifically, these\ninclude identification using the relatively greater depolarization by\nnatural targets (icebergs) relative to that by man-made targets (ships),\nand identification by means of doubly-reversed circular polarization\nproduced by reflecting surfaces intersecting at right angles.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following report was stimulated by a U. S. Coast Guard requirement for an all-weather remote sensing system for iceberg surveillance\nby the International Ice Patrol and especially by work undertaken at the\nNASA Lewis Research Center to implement that system (ref. 1).\nThe objective is to determine the simplest method for locating and\ndistinguishing icebergs from ships by means of airborne remote sensors.\nA combination of methods may be necessary. For precisely locating and\ndistinguishing these targets, the selected radiation wavelength should be\nas short as possible consistent with the requirement for cloud and precipitation penetration. Light must be excluded because of its inability to\npenetrate clouds. Longer wavelength microwave radiation will penetrate\nclouds and precipitation and is, therefore, appropriate for sensing.\nMicrowave sensing systems may be active (radar) or passive (microwave radiometer). Radar incorporates a microwave transmitter as the\nsource of radiation to be detected by a receiver after reflection from\nthe target (iceberg or ship) and extraneous objects (the sea). The simpler microwave radiometer does not include a transmitter, but rather detects radiation emitted from or reflected by the target and extraneous\nobjects.\n\n2\n\nRadar is essentially a range measuring device, whereas the microwave radiometer is primarily an energy measuring device. However,\nradar can be used to measure reflected electromagnetic energy, whereas\ndistance can be measured by radiometric mapping. An important advantage of radar is controllability of the amplitude and waveform of the\ntransmitted signal allowing more freedom in methods of identifying complex targets.\nResolution is an important limitation of remote sensors in distinguishing small targets. The horizontal range resolution of airborne\nradar for earthbound targets is best for targets toward the horizon and\npoorest for targets near nadir (because the range is then essentially\nconstant). Contrariwise, the horizontal range resolution of the microwave radiometer is best near nadir and worst toward the horizon (because of the incl ination of the target-to-sensor propagation vector to\nthe horizontal). Thus, radar is more generally used for detecting targets at depression angles (below horizontal) less than 45 degrees.\nTargets beneath the aircraft are not surveyed. The radiometer scans\nbest beneath the aircraft where radar is not appropriate. Thus, the\ntwo methods are complementary.\nThe abil ity to locate and distinguish targets using radar depends\nupon signal characteristics and target characteristics.\nSignificant signal characteristics include:\n1.\n\nampl itude\n\n2.\n\nfrequency\n\n3.\n\nphase\n\n4.\n\npolarization\n\nThere are two categories of target characteristics; namely, those\nwhich serve to locate it and those which identify it. The target is\nlocated from antenna orientation and signal propagation-time measurements, which yield azimuth and slant range, respectively. Possible significant characteristics which may be used to identify a target include\'\nI.\n\nsize\n\n2.\n\nshape\n\n3.\n\nroughness\n\n3\n4.\n\nmater i a I\na.\nb.\n\n5.\n\nreflectivity\ntransparency\n\nmovement\na.\n\nvelocity\n\nb.\n\nacceleration\n\nIt would be most desirable to select the best target identification method by a calculation which would compare the probability of\ntarget detection and some numerical measure of target identification\nfor different methods. Unfortunately, the variety of identification\nmethods, the complexity of the targets, the difficulty of defining a\nsingle measure of identification common to all methods, and the lack\nof experimental data presently preclude this possibility. Rather, for\nthe present, the "best" method (or methods) will be selected using\nqual itative arguments and a few elementary calculations.\nMost of the methods to be discussed have been previously reported\nin declassified reports, many of which are not readily obtainable.\nThus, the present report may serve to collate these methods.\nRADARS, RADIOMETERS AND RESOLUTION\nThe desired information consists of the location and identification\nof the target.\nAt least two types of monostatic (transmitter and receiver at same\nlocation) airborne radar have been used for iceberg surveillance or to\ndistinguish icebergs from ships. These two types are side-looking aircraft radar (SLAR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SLAR transmits\na fan-shaped microwave beam in a vertical plane perpendicular to the aircraft track and, hence, senses targets to the side of the aircraft. SAR\nrecords similar information by transmitting a beam with a much broader\nhorizontal component and utilizing the translation of the antenna and\ninterference of the return wave with a copy of the transmitted waveform\nto effectively synthesize a much larger horizontal aperture. This provides much greater along-track (linear azimuthal) resolution of targets,\nbut at much greater cost. SAR is called focused, or unfocused, depending\non whether or not the interference of the reflected and transmitted waveforms takes account of the variable delay of the return wavefront over\nthe synthetic aperture.\n\nThe basic radiometer utilizes a highly directional antenna and\nmechanical scanning for surveillance. The scanning need not be restricted to the across-track direction.\nUsing radar, range and amplitude information may be recorded\neither in a time format or space format.\nIn the time format the return signal may be recorded on magnetic\ntape, or by some comparable means, as a function of time. In the\nspace format, the return signal is translated into the form of a map\nof the region being surveyed. The spatial format not only provides a\npicture of the shape of the target but also includes much extraneous\ninformation about the region surrounding the target. If the target is\nclearly resolved, then it may be identifiable. If the target is not\nclearly resolved, then the spatial format may indicate the location of\nthe target, but not necessarily its identity. Thus, for identification\npurposes, spatial mapping may require too much handling of extraneous\ndata. If the temporal data contain information for identifying targets\nby means other than target shape, then the time format may be preferable.\nIf a spatial format is to be effective, the spatial resolution\nof the radar should be much less than the target size. The spatial\nresolution is the minimum separation at which two points can just be\ndistinguished. The spatial resolution can be decomposed into two components; namely, the cross-track component, or range resolution, and\nthe along-track component, or linear azimuthal resolution. For SLAR\nand SAR the range resolution is, at best, about 3 meters (ref. 2),\nindependent of range. For SLAR, along-track resolution is determined\nby the angular resolution of the antenna and is, at best, about 3\nmeters/kilometer range (ref. 3). At a range of 2 kilometers, corresponding along-track values are claimed to be 3 meters for unfocused\nSAR and I meter for focused SAR (ref. 4). The unfocused SAR resolution along track increases in proportion to the square root of the\nrange, whereas the focused SAR resolution along track is, in principle,\nindependent of range.\nIt is evident that resolution may be a serious limitation in distinguishing all except the larger ships and icebergs by using airborne\nradar imagery.\nSince radiometer scanning need not be across track, the radiometer\nresolution may more generally be decomposed into horizontal range and\nlinear azimuthal components. Both components are determined by the\nangular resolution of the antenna and the range. However, because of\nthe inclination of the target-to-receiver propagation vector with respect to the vertical, the horizontal range resolution decreases as\nthe square of the range.\n\n5\nThe radiometer must generally respond to much weaker signals than\nradar. Thus, the radiometer operates best at shorter ranges where signals are stronger and atmospheric attenuation is minimal.\nTARGETS\nThe problem is to identify the nature of a target which has been\nlocated in range and azimuth. First, each identifying characteristic\nis discussed separately.\nSize\nDetermination of target size alone is sufficient for target identification only if the size exceeds that of the largest ships and, then,\nonly if it also greatly exceeds the microwave resolution. If these conditions are satisfied, the target is assumed to be an iceberg.\nActually, there are several possible sizes which may be of interest,\ndepending upon what is known about the target geometry. These include:\n1.\n\nplanform area\n\n2.\n\nbeam interception cross-section\n\n3.\n\nimage cross-sect ion\n\n4.\n\nradar cross-section\n\nAl I except the radar cross-section are geometric cross-sections. The\nplanform area is the area of the target at nadir. The beam interception\ncross-section is defined as the target cross-sectional area measured\nnormal to a radar beam from any given direction. The image cross-section\nis the target area indicated by mapping the amplitude of the target return signal as a function of the horizontal range and linear azimuth.\nThe radar cross-section is a target area derived from microwave intensity\nmeasurements.\nOnly the image cross-section and radar cross-section can be determined by remote sensing of unidentified targets. However, in selecting\na target identification method the planform area or beam interception\ncross-section, obtainable from photographs of known targets, may be acceptable substitutes for the image cross-section determined operationally.\nFor a flat target in the plane of the earth\'s surface the image crosssection should equal the planform area.\n\n6\n\nAssume that the radiated power incident on a target is scattered\nisotropically and without loss. Then, the total scattered power received at range R large compared with the wavelength and target size\nequals the total power incident on the target; that is,\nI a\n\no\n\n= 4IIR21 s\n\nwhere\nis the radiation Intensity incident on the target, I\nis\nthe inte~sity of the isotropically scattered radiation at range sR ,\nand a is the illuminated cross-sectional area, or radar cross-section,\nof the target. Thus,\n\na\n\n= 4l1R2 (I / I )\n\ns\n\n0\n\nMost targets are not isotropic scatterers, so that a is a function of\nthe direction of view. Also, I\nis measured only at the one location\ns\nof the receiver antenna. As a result, the calculated radar cross-section\na may differ greatly from and may not be simply related to any of the\npreviously defined geometric cross-sections of the target (ref. 5, chap.\n27, p. 3). Because I ~ R- 2 ,the radar cross-section a is independent of range. For a \xc2\xa7iven range, a is a measure of the relative intensity of radiation refJected from the target to the receiver. Thus,\nthe reflected intensity bf radiation from ships and icebergs may be compared by calculating their radar cross-sections. With additional knowledge of one of the geometric cross-sections of the target it may be\npossible to distinguish ships from icebergs, as will be discussed.\nOccasionally. an icet~fg may be high enough to produce a radar shadow\non surroundina sea ice. This shadow may be detected in radar imagery\n(refs. 6 and 2). It is not-likely to be detectable if the iceberg is surrounded by sea water because of the lack of image contrast between the sea\nwater and shadow (ref. 6).\nShape\nThe shape of an object with dimensions near the threshold of resolution cannot be readily determined. The radar across-track resolution of\nat least 3 meters implies that the characteristic dimensions of the target must be much greater than 3 meters if its shape is to be determined.\nThe results of one mathematical analysis (ref. 7) showed that a simple\ntarget (a cross) was identifiable from its shape only when the target\ndimensions exceeded approximately 10 times the resolution. Thus, shape\nalone is not a good means for distinguishing icebergs from ships ur,less\nthe target minimum dimension at least exceeds 10 meters. Even then, to\ndifferentiate these targets it must be assumed that the iceberg is not\nshaped 1 ike a ship.\n\n7\nSAR imagery has been used to identify some icebergs by their\nshape (ref. 2). However, an iceberg with radar cross-section comparable to that of surrounding ice clutter may not be identifiable\nin this manner because of lack of contrast (ref. 2).\nCoherence is a factor in radar imagery, but not in radiometer\nimagery. Because of coherence between radar reflections from adjacent areas of a target, the resulting interference of the reflected\nwaves at the antenna may yield a target image which is both space\nand time dependent. Thus, the image planforms of targets with dimensions exceeding the resolution limit may appear deformed (ref. 7).\nIn contrast, all target points represent incoherent sources for radiometry. Hence, the interference phenomenon and the consequent image\ndeformation does not occur. As a result, all other things being\nequal, target shape may be better determined using radiometry.\nRoughness\nFor targets at ranges greatly exceeding the target size and\ndimensions of the radar antenna, the microwave radiation appears to\nbe emitted from a point source and is, therefore, spatially coherent.\nBecause the illumination of each point on the target is then effectively undirectional, the target1s back-reflected intensity will\ndepend on its roughness. Here "roughness" means any irregularity of\nthe target configuration which affects reflection. The principal\ntypes of reflections are specular reflections, diffuse scattering,\nscattering by sharp discontinuities and internal reflections (ref. 8).\nThe reflection is specular if the roughness dimensions are much greater\nthan the radar wavelength and diffuse if the roughness dimensions are\na fraction of the wavelength. The scattering at discontinuities is\nspecular if the radius of the discontinuity exceeds the wavelength and\nis diffuse otherwise. Internal reflections may occur if the target is\na dielectric so that radiation penetrates it. This possibility depends on the material and will be discussed under "Materia1. "\nMan-made targets tend to consist of or include structures with\nsimple geometric shapes. Assuming that the surfaces of these structures are smooth at radar wavelengths, reflections therefrom are specular if the structure dimensions ~re at least 10 times the wavelength.\nThis is the optical region (ref. 5, chap. 27, p. 21). If the structure dimensions are greater than the wavelength, resonances may occur\nin which the reflected intensity relative to the geometrical crosssection may be several times the optical value. This is the Mie, or\nresonance, region. If the structure dimensions are less than half the\nwavelength, then diffuse scattering occurs. The relative reflected\nintensity becomes only a fraction of the specular value and tends to\nzero with decreasing structure size.\n\n8\n\nRadar wavelengths \xc2\xab1m.) are much less than overall dimensions\nof ships and icebergs. However, the roughness of ships and icebergs\nmay possess any value less than the overall target dimensions, so that\nthe backscattered radiation may include specular, resonant, and diffuse components. The reflection from a ship may occasionally result\nprimarily from specular reflection, or glint, off a broad flat surface.\nHowever, because most ship surfaces are curved at most aspects, it is\nmore reasonable to expect specular reflections from surface areas small\ncompared with the overall dimensions. Resonance reflections from small\nstructures may occur because of the simple geometry of ship structures.\nThe intensity of diffuse reflections is expected to be much less than\nthat of specular reflections because of the smoothness of ship surfaces.\nPossibly this expectation is confirmed by large fluctuations (30 dB) of\nindividual pulse amplitudes as a function of the viewing aspect.\nThe expectation of glint and resonance reflections may be less from\nicebergs than from ships because of the random structure of icebergs.\nHowever, specular reflections may be expected from icebergs, especially\nfrom those surfaces which have been smoothed by washing with sea water.\nThe ratio of diffuse to specular reflection may be greater for icebergs,\nespecially the larger ones, than for ships. Not only may unwashed iceberg surfaces be rough, but also internal inhomogeneities may scatter\nradiation which penetrates the surface.\nSpecular reflecting areas contributing to the received signal are\ngenerally separated by distances large compared with the wavelength of\nthe radiation. (Otherwise the reflection would be diffuse and associated with surface roughness.) Thus, the reflecting ship, and probably\nthe iceberg, consists mainly of a collection of separated specular reflecting centers (ref. 9). If the extent of the ship does not exceed\na resolution cell, then the net received radiation amplitude is determined by the sum of the instantaneous amplitudes of signals received\nfrom all reflecting centers within the limits of the resolution cell.\nThe resulting coherent intensity is determined by interference between\nthe signal contributions from each reflecting center. If the extent of\nthe ship exceeds the resolution cell then the intensity from each resolution unit will be as just described so that the "instantaneous image" of\nthe entire ship will be comprised of cells of varying intensity. The\nship m~v, in fact, appear to consist of several targets rather than one\n(refs. 7 and 10). Hence, the ship may not be identifiable as such from\nits imagery. On the other hand, if the ship were a diffuse reflector,\nnearly all points would contribute to its image. Then, it would likely\nbe identifiable.\nSince coherence is not a factor in radiometry, each point of a\ntarget radiates\' independentlY in all directions. The variation of target radiation from adjacent areas results from temperature differences,\n\n9\nbut more predominantly, from emissivity variations and reflections from\nother emitters. For these reasons the measured radiometric intensity\nfrom any target may vary widely as a function of the viewing aspect and\ntime of day.\nBecause of the nonsphericity of most targets, their radar image\nintensities are strongly dependent on orientation. This results from\nthe relative shift and exchange of reflecting centers as the direction\nof observation changes.\nThe complexity of ship and iceberg geometries makes theoretical\nidentification of target configuration from its roughness characteristics\nmost difficult.\nMaterial\nDepending on its transparency to microwaves, the target material may\ncontribute to distinguishing icebergs from ships. The transparency is\ndetermined primarily by the conductivity of the material and the radiation frequency. In the present problem the material may be a significant\nfactor because ice and water are poor conductors relative to metals.\nIn Table I, conductivity a c \' refractive index n, skin depth d,\nattenuation A, and attenuation index K are listed for the appropriate\nmaterials, steel (St), salt water (SW), salt-water ice (SWI), aresh water\n(FW) and fresh-water ice (FWI) at the frequency v = 1.59 x 10 Hz (159\nMHz) in the VHF band, a very low radar frequency. A low frequency was\nchosen to provide an estimate of the maximum penetration of the material\nthat could be expected. Generally, calculated and experimental results\nare in good agreement, except in the case of salt-water ice where the experimental attenuation in decibels is about 10 times the theoretical value.\n(The listed theoretical skin depth would be too large, hence, would be\nmuch greater than the experimental value.)\nIt is evident from Table I that the microwave transmittance of steel\nand salt water is negligible, is poor in salt-water ice, but is good in\nfresh water and fresh-water ice. Thus, microwave penetration might be\nused to distinguish ships from fresh-water ice, but possibly not from\nsalt-water ice. Icebergs, which originate from glaciers, consist of\nfresh-water ice, but might be at least partially coated with sea water\nor sea-water ice as a result of the wave action of sea water in which\nthey are partly immersed.\nIn radiometry, the emissivity, which influences the thermal radiation, is determined partly by the material, as well as its roughness.\n\n10\nReflectivity\nThe microwave reflectivity characteristics of ships and icebergs\nare so different that reflectivity might contribute in distinguishing\ntargets by radar.\nThe normal reflectivity ~ at air-water, air-ice, and ice-water\nboundaries is given in Table I I for the low radar frequency 159 MHz.\nThe normal reflectivity of an air-steel or air-water interface is high,\nwhereas that at an air-ice interface Is low. However, the reflectivity\nat an ice-salt water interface is also high. Thus, airborne microwaves\nwill be strongly reflected off a steel or salt water surface, but will\npenetrate fresh-water ice and may be more strongly reflected off the\nback (ice-salt water) interface (ref. 11). Of course, the relative intensity of the front and back surface reflections depends upon the\nthickness and absorption of the ice.\nIn general, reflectivity is a function of\ntion. However, for normal incidence, as often\ntion using a monostatic radar, reflectivity is\nif the reflector dimensions greatly exceed the\npolarization may be a significant effect.\n\npolarization of the radiamay be required for recepindependent of polarization\nwavelength. Otherwise,\n\nRadar cross-sect i on measurements of both sh ips (ref. 12) and ice\nblocks (ref. 13) have been found to be independent of the plane of polarization for HH and VV polarization*. For ships at 45 degrees illumination depression angle, the VH cross-polarization cross-section\nwas about 10 to 20 dB less than the VV cross-section. For ice blocks\nat normal incidence, the HV cross-section was about 10 dB less than\nthe VV or HH cross-sections. Thus, the cross-polarized return\ntended to be less than the parallel-polarized return. It has been found\nthat the ratio of parallel-polarized return to cross-polarized return\ntends to be greater for man-made targets than for natural targets (ref.\n14). This difference has been used to detect submarine periscopes and\nsnorkels in the presence of sea clutter (ref. 14). Possibly, it can\nalso be used to distinguish icebergs from ships.\n\n*\n\nH means polarization plane parallel to the earth\'s surface. V\nmeans polarization plane perpendicular to the earth\'s surface. Given\nVV, HH, HV or VH. The first letter represents the polarization\nplane of the transmitted wave. The second letter represents the polarization plane of the receiver antenna.\n\n11\nFor circularly polarized radiation both same and reversed polarization signals have been intermittently received from the same ship\n(ref. 15). This impl ies that both double and single reflections, respectively, have occurred. The effect may not be the same for icebergs. Thus, polarization reversal might be used to distinguish ships\nfrom icebergs.\nBecause icebergs tend to be more irregular than ships, there\nexists the possibility that the two targets might be distinguished by\ndifferences in their spectral reflectance at wavelengths corresponding\nto target subdimensions. Specifically, the reflectance spectrum of an\niceberg may be smoother than that of a ship, which might exhibit relatively intense discrete frequency lines (associated with discrete subdimensions of the target) on an otherwise smooth spectrum.\nMovement\nSometimes icebergs and ships may be distinguished by their\nmovements. The mode of detecting radial movement is Doppler frequency\nshift. Using SLAR and spatial format, visible wakes may disclose movement. Both ships and icebergs may possess a wake. However, ships in\nmotion generally display a well-defined wake with apex at the target,\nwhereas icebergs will only occasionally exhibit a wake of near constant\nwidth and with no defined apex (ref. 6).\nUsing SAR, movement of the target during the observation period\nmay result in various forms of defocusing, attenuation and image shift,\nincluding:\n1.\n\n"blur ll due to radial acceleration and cross-range target\n\nvelocity.\n2.\n\nIlsmearll due to relative radial velocity.\n\n3. attenuation due to blur and Doppler-frequency shift beyond\nthe azimuth passband of the radar, and\n4.\n\ncross-range image shift due to radial velocity (refs. 16,2).\n\nAlthough these image defects might appear to make SAR useless for identifying targets which move during observation, in principle, spatial filtering of the image might, on the contrary, not only be used to detect\nmoving targets but also be used to identify them by virtue of their\nvelocity and shape.\n\n12\n\nMETHODS OF IDENTIFYING TARGETS\nIndividual characteristics or combinations of the cited characteristics of a target might be used for target identification. Whatever\nthe choice, the signal (target) must be detectable in a noise (sea clutter) background. The signal may be recorded as a function of spatial\ndimensions or time, or their respective Fourier transforms, spatial frequency and frequency. The spatial format is most useful if the target\nis resolved. If the target is sufficiently resolved, its image crosssection may be measurable. This cross-section constitutes a potentially\nuseful variable in identifying the target. The "roughness l l of the target relative to the radar wavelength affects the reflection characteristics of the target. The reflectance is, in general, specular, resonant,\nor diffuse depending, respectively, upon whether the wavelength is less\nthan, approximately equal to, or greater than the surface roughness of\nthe target. If the incident radiation is plane polarized, then backscattered radiation will also be plane polarized if the reflectance is specular. However, if the reflectance is diffuse, then depolarization of\nthe backscattered radiation will occur (ref. 17). This and the preceding\ncharacteristics may all be useful in categorizing methods of target identifi cat ion.\nAmong the ways of classifying target-identification schemes, classification according to the ability of the method to resolve targets seems appropriate because targets of interest are likely to be detected near the\nthreshold of resolution. Using this classification scheme, some possible\nmethods for distinguishing icebergs from ships are listed as follows:\nA.\n\nGeometric cross-section determinable\n1\n\nI.\n\nB.\n\nRadar cross-section differences\n\nTarget resolved, but shape indeterminate\n1.\n2.\n\nC.\n\nTwo-frequency differential penetration\nSpatial spectrum difference\n\nTarget not resolved\n1.\n\nDiscrete components in frequency spectrum\n\n2.\n\nDoppler spectrum difference\nI\n\n3.\n\nDepolarization difference\n\n4.\n\nDoubly reversed, circular-polarization difference\n\n13\n\nEach of the listed methods is applicable to targets larger than\nthose for which it is listed. Methods listed under A and B involve\nmeasurements of the target geometry, whereas those under C do not.\nThe first two methods under C are spectral methods, whereas the other\ntwo are polarization methods. Whereas all other methods require one\nreceiver antenna, the polarization methods in C may ~require more than\none antenna. Each of the listed possibilities is now discussed in\nmore detai 1\nAI.\n\nRadar Cross-Section as Function of Geometric Cross-Section\n\nIn this method it is assumed that because ice, especially freshwater ice, reflects microwaves poorly relative to the steel in ships,\nthe radar cross-section of an iceberg should be less that that of a\nsteel ship having the same geometric cross-section (ref. 1).\nMicrowave reflections from ships are more intense and steadier\nthan those from ice (ref. 18). It has been reported (ref. 15) that\nice typical of that in icebergs on the Grand Banks has a reflection\ncoefficient of approximately 0.33 and reflects microwaves 60 times\nless than a steel ship of equivalent cross-sectional area. Thus, differences in reflected microwave intensities from targets with known\ngeometric cross-sections should be sufficient to distinguish between\nships and icebergs. Unfortunately, it may not be possible to determine\nwith sufficient accuracy the geometric cross-section of the target using\nradar if the target dimensions are not at least an order of magnitude\ngreater than the spatial resolution of the radar.\nRadar cross-sections of ships are listed in Table II I.\nthe size of a two-man raft, or larger,\n\nFor ships\n\n-12 < vdbsm < 80\n2\nwhere the cross-section a\nis in decibels (re. 1 m. ). These are\ndbsm\nmedian values obtained from many reflected pulses. For a given ship\nthe median value as a function of azimuth may vary by 20 dB., the minimum being obtained for bow illumination and the maximum for broadside\nillumination. The median value may also decrease 5 to 20 dB. as the\ndepression angle of illumination is increased. "Instantaneous" (single\npulse) values of radar cross-section may deviate from the medians by\n!15 dB .\xe2\x80\xa2 or more.\nIn Table I I I, radar cross-sections for ships included in reference\n19 were computed from near-field cross-sections a\nby using the relan\ntion 0" = 0" /4 (ref. 20).\nn\n\n14\nRadar cross-sections of ships are usually, but not always, independent of polarization and radiation frequency (ref. 12).\nIf ships are to be unmistakably distinguished from icebergs on\nthe basis of radar cross-section, the radar cross-sections of the two\ntargets must not overlap; that is, for the same geometric cross-section\nthe radar cross-sections of all ships must exceed those of all icebergs.\nRadar cross-section data for blocks of ice and icebergs are available\nfor testing this hypothesis. The ice-block data is "laboratoryi\' data,\nwhereas the iceberg data was obtained under operational conditions.\nThe data for blocks of ice indicate that the radar cross-sections\nof ships and ice may overlap. For a block of ice (geometric crosssection, 44 in. x 22 in.) resting on a snow surface, it was found that\n0d bsm\n\n=-\n\n16\n\nor more, at normal incidence with 10 G Hz (X-band) radiation and VV\npolarization (ref. 13). For other angles of incidence adbsm was as\nmuch as 50 dB below this maximum value although values within 10 dB\nof the maximum were not uncommon at other angles of incidence. Crosssections were essentially the same for both fresh-water ice and saltwater ice and were also independent of polarization. Nor was wavelength\nsignificant unless the surface roughness was comparable. However, it\nwas found that a ~ A2 when the reflection was specular ( A much less\nthan surface roughness = smooth block) and 0 00 A when the reflection\nwas diffuse ( A comparable to surface roughness), where A is the\ngeometric cross-section of the ice surface normal to the radar beam.\nFor 10 G Hz radiation frequency the reflection was specular.\nTo calculate the radar cross-section for normal incidence and other\nvalues of geometric cross-section\n0(2)\n\ndbsm\n\n= o(1)\n\ndbsm\n\n+\n\nwhere the superscript denotes the target. Thus, if the geometric crosssection of the iceblock mentioned above were increased to equal the planform area of the picket shig )listed in Table I I I, the maximum radar crosssection of the ice block, 0d~sm\' would be\n\nO~~~m\n\n=\n\n16\n\n~\n\n20 log\n\n0~~~~5\n\n=\n\n87\n\n15\nwhereas the maximum radar cross-section of the picket ship was crdbsm =\n47. Thus, the ice cross-section exceeds that of the picket ship by 40\ndB. To see whether this is a reasonable number, the radar cross-section\nof the ice block may be compared with that of a perfectly conducting\ndisk with the same geometric cross-section illuminated at normal incidence. The radar cross-section of a perfectly conducting disk at normal\nincidence is given by\n\nwhere a is the radius of the dis~0(2ef. 21, p. 513).\nand v = 10 G Hz; cr = 7.6388 x 10 m.; that is,\ncr\n\n( d)\n\ndbsm\n\n=\n\nFor\n\nIIa\n\n2\n\n= 2339\n\n2\nm\n\n109\n\nfor the disk, which exceeds that for the equivalent ice block by 22 dB.\nHence, relative to a perfect conductor, the power reflection coefficient\nfor the ice block is 0.0068, which is a reasonable, if not slightly low,\nvalue for ice.\nThe preceding results show that the radar cross-section of the ice\nmay exceed that of a ship by 40 dB, or so. If the smooth ice is not illuminated by a monostatic radar at normal incidence, its radar crosssection may be as much as 50 dB below the value at normal incidence. However, if the ice roughness is comparable to the radiation wavelength, then\nthe radar cross-section may be much closer to the maximum value for smooth\nice at normal incidence (ref. 22). Thus, laboratory data indicate that\nships may not always be distinguished from icebergs on the basis of reflected intensity (radar cross-section), range and geometric cross-section\ndeterm i na t ions.\nThe preceding case of normal incidence on a large, smooth, flat\nblock of ice likely possesses low probability of occurrence. Radar crosssections of icebergs are expected to be much lower generally.\nMeasurements on icebergs at near-zero depression angle have shown\nthat, for equal echo amplitudes, the ratio of the beam interception\ncross-section to that calculated for a perfectly conducting sphere\nranges from 10 to 400 with an aver(age)of(67, independent of range (ref.\n23). Thus, on the average, if I sph II b) = 1,\n\n16\nwhere A is the beam interception cross-section, and the superscripts\nband sph refer to iceberg and sphere, respectively.

The data previously discussed were related to calculations for a perfectly conducting disk, rather\nthan a sphere. The radar cross-section of a sphere with radius a is\ngiven by\n\nso that, for a disk with the same radius,\n\nTherefore, relative to a disk at normal incidence,\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\nadbsm\n\nadbsm\n\nfor an iceberg, where\n\n10 log (ka) 2\n\nk = 2IT/A.\n\nFor an iceberg having a beam interception cross-section equal to\nthe planform area of the picket ship, the preceding formulas and data\nindicate that\na(b)\ndbsm\n\n=\n\n109 - 75.1 - 36.5\n\n= -2.6\non the average, with lower and upper limits of -18.1 dbsm and 13.9 dbsm,\nrespectively. These values for icebergs are considerably less than (-73\ndbsm) those interpolated from the ice-block data, and are more realistic.\nThe minimum median value for the picket ship is approximately 47-20 = 27\ndbsm for bow illumination. The minimum instantaneous value for bow illumination would be approximately 12 dbsm. Therefore, the iceberg data\n\n17\nindicate that, as long as ship planform area is not much less than\nits beam interception cross-section, then there is little likelihood that icebergs and ships having the same interception crosssection would be confused. However, to be accurately measured, the\ngeometric cross-section must exceed the spatial resolution of the\nrad-ar by at least two ord-ers o-f magn-ituae. This implies that-the 2\ngeometric cross-section of the target must exceed 900 m /km. range\n2\nwhen using SLAR, or 300 m , independent of range, when using SAR.\nSince the mass of an iceberg is primarily submerged, these crosssections may be associated with objects hazardous to navigation.\nThe accuracy requirements in measuring geometric cross-section\nmay not be severe. Since 6A% ~ 2 6A/A, where 6 denotes error,\nand 6A denotes error due to the error of A, the error of 0 is\nrelatively sensitive to the error of A. For example, if 6A/A = 1,\nthen ~Aodbsm = 3; whereas, if ~A/A = 5, then 6Aodbsm = 10. This\nlarger error is quite plausible for target sizes near the resolution\nlimit. However, the corresponding error of\nis only comparable\nto other variations due to aspect and signal averaging. Therefore,\neven these large errors in measuring geometric cross-section may\nstill permit icebergs to be distinguished from ships.\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nIf the target cannot be resolved but its radar image dimensions\nexceed those of a point, it may still be possible to estimate the\nimage cross-section of the target. The excess breadth, ~e\' of the\nimage indicates the target dimensions along track, and the excess\nduration, t e , of the target return yields the target dimension re\nacross track according to the relation r~ = cte/2, where c is the\nspeed of light. The geometric cross-section of the target is given by\n\nIf the target is effectively a point or a line, then this cross-section\ntechnique cannot be used. The target is a point if its dimensions are\nsmall compared with the dimensions of a resolution cell. The resolution in range, or\' is given by\n\nOr = (c/2)Ot = c/2B\nwhere 8 t is the time resolution, and B is the modulation bandwidth\nof the radiation (ref. 24)~ The linear azimuthal resolution, as\' for\nSLAR is given by\n\n85 = ARID\n\n18\n\nr\n\nwhere D is the horizontal aperture of the antenna (ref. 4). If the\ncorresponding target dimensions are small in comparison with these\ncomponents of resolution, then the target is effectively a point.\nConsider a pulse modulated radar with A = 3.2 cm.~ pulse width\n~t = 2 x 10-7s ., D = 5 m. The bandwidth is approximated by B ~ l/~t =\n-1\n5 x 10 6s . . At range R = 5 x 10 3m., or = Os ~ 30 m. For target\ndimensions much less than this, say 5 m., or so, the target appears to\nbe a point. These dimensions correspond to targets of appreciable size.\nAt best, relative to the preceding data, an order of magnitude improvement in linear azimuthal resolution is practically attainable using\nSlAR. Note that, in the above example, Os > 30 m. if R > 1 km. Thus,\nalthough the resolution may be sufficient to distinguish ships from icebergs at close range, say 1 km., it is not likely to be sufficient at\nlong range, say 10 km., or more.\nIt seems worthwhile to search for other radar methods which might\nwork better for barely resolved or unresolved targets.\nFor radiometer imagery near nadir the angular resolution should be\nsimilar to the azimuthal resolution of SlAR with the same antenna beamwidth and operating at the same wavelength.\nHowever, because the radiometer image is for the area beneath the\naircraft, on the same mission the target ranges for the radiometer are\nless than for the radar. Thus, the linear resolution of the radiometer\nmay be better than the linear azimuthal resolution of the SLAR.\nRadar cross-section is not a factor with radiometry. Rather, the\nradiometer senses the brightness temperature of the area scanned. The\ncontrast in brightness temperature exposes targets. Because of the\nmany factors (temperature, emissivity, roughness, extraneous sources)\nwhich affect brightness temperature, there is no guarantee that brightness temperature of ships and icebergs will not overlap on occasion so\nthat the two targets may be identified. For example, can an Ice-covered\nship be distinguished from an iceberg?\nIf radiometry were to prove unsatisfactory, then forward looking\nradar might provide an alternative for coverage along the flight path.\n\n19\n\n61.\n\nTwo-Frequency Diffe rentia l Penet ration\n\nThis method util izes the differ ence in microwave penet ration\ndistin guish\nof ice and metal s as a funct ion of freque ncy in order to\nration of metal s by\nicebe rgs from ships .

(This formula is\neasily derived from the optical problem of the spacing of extrema\nin Fraunhofer diffraction by a rectangular aperture.)

The major dimensions of the ship are determined by the minimum spacing of selected\norders of diffraction extrema along and normal to the symmetry ax(s~\nAssuming that the radar image of a ship is axially symmetric,\nthe potentiality of the method can be tested by optical means. Although the radar return from a target contains information on both\namplitude and phase, in determining symmetry of the image crosssection of the target, intensity information is sufficient. Thus,\nradar images of targets can be photographed on film, so that the\ntarget is represented by a transparent aperture on an opaque background. Each aper~ure may be illuminatedby a_collimated_Jaser beam\nto obtain the spatial Fourier transform (spatial spectrum) of the\naperture at the back focus of a lens placed behind the aperture\n(fig. 1). The target may then be identified by observing whether the\nthe transform is spatially symmetric about an axis (ref. 26).\nAlthough it may be easy to identify the nature of the target\nby visual inspection of its spatial spectrum, the identification may\nbe more difficult to accomplish by automatic means. One possibility\nis to orient the target major axis perpendicular to a split slit\nlocated at the transform plane (fig. 1) and centered on the target\naxis. Two equal photocells, one behind each slit, detect all illumination transmitted through the slits. The split slit scans the\nentire spectrum by moving parallel to the target major axis. If the\noutput voltages of the two photocells are equal throughout the entire\nscan, then the spectrum and associated target must be symmetrical\nabout the translational axis. Hence, the target must be a ship. If\nthe photocell outputs do not remain equal throughout the scan, then\nthe target is asymmetrical and is presumed to be an iceberg.\n\n23\nCl.\n\nDiscr ete Components in Frequency Spectrum\n\nthe\nThis and the follow ing methods are intend ed to apply when\ntarge t appea rs to be a point .\netric\nMan-made targe ts such as ships are gener ally simpl e geom\ns.

An iceberg1s motion, except for the propulsion\ncomponent, will be similarly affected, although not by the same magnitude,\nso its Doppler shift may be different. Finally, the ocean1s reflected return, called "clutter,11 results from its own motions; that is, currents,\nswells, waves, and also wind-induced spray.

However, for any plane\nof polarization of the incident radiation a certain portion of the radiation reflected from most targets may generally have components of polarization in other planes; that is, will be depolarized. For singly-reflected\nbackscatter this depolarization of plane polarized incident ragia~ion\nwill not occur if any of the following conditions apply (ref. 17):\n1.\n\nThe radiation is imposed at grazing incidence.\n\n2. The plane of polarization of the incident radiation lies in,\nor is perpendicular to, the local plane of incidence.\n3.\n\nThe target is a perfect conductor.\n\n4.\n\nThe incident radiation is normal to the target surface.\n\nThe specular components add coherently, whereas the diffuse components\nadd incoherently. Only the diffuse components contribute to depolarization (ref. 17). Thus, if the surface roughness exceeds the radiation\nwavelength, depolarization may be minimal. Since the surface roughness\nof man-made targets tends to be less than for natural targets, relative\ndepolarization of backscattered radiation tends to be less for man-made\ntargets (ref. 14).\nRelatively little depolarization is produced by ships (about 10 dB,\nor 10 percent, for transmitted horizontally polarized radiatIon qnd\nslightly greater for vertically polarized radiation) (refs. 33 and 34).\nIn addition to depolarization by diffuse scattering, specular backreflection off mutually perpendicular surfaces may produce depolarization. In particular, depolarization occurs if the plane of polarization\nis neither parallel to nor perpendicular to the line of intersection of\nthe reflecting planes. If this line of intersection is rotated-through\nan angle 8 about the axis of propagation of the incident radiation,\nthen the plane of polarization of the reflected radiation will be rotated\nthrough an angle 28 (ref. 33). Rotation of the plane of polarization\nof reflected radiation might occur in this manner from a ship as a result\nof its pitch and roll.\nThe depolarization by icebergs may be somewhat greater that that by\nships. Plane polarized, ultra-high frequency (440 MHz), pulse-modulated\nradiation penetrating glacier ice has displayed polarization rotation\nup to 85 degrees and a polarization ellipticity ratio as great as 6 dB\n\n27\n(ref. 35). The latter implies ratios of depolarized to polarized\npower as great as 25 percent, although most values were lower than\nI percent. Nevertheless, the possibility of obtaining relatively\nlarge values of depolarization and/or large values of rotation of\nthe plane of polarization by icebergs indicates that they may, in\nthis manner, be distinguishable from ships.\nAs a possible way to detect and identify a target, a planepolarized wave is transmitted, whereas both parallel- (to the transmitted wave) and cross-polarized waves are received. All return\nsignals whose parallel-polarized amplitude or whose ratio of crossto parallel-polarized amplitude exceeds preset values determined to,\nat least, exclude clutter are recorded. Any signal which exceeds\nthese preselected thresholds is assumed to be from a target. Any\nsignal which exceeds the polarization ratio threshold is assumed to\nbe from an iceberg since this threshold has presumably been preselected to exclude man-made targets, as well as clutter. All noniceberg targets are assumed to be ships.\nThe radar wavelength may be optimized by evaluating roughness\nspectra of ships, icebergs and the sea. It is to be expected that\nthe roughness spectrum of a ship will be a maximum at low discrete\nspatial frequencies corresponding to ship structure dimensions.\nThe iceberg roughness spectrum should not include discrete components. The sea roughness spectrum may be broader and more uniform\nthan the other two. By choosing a radar wavelength which is shorter\nthan the wavelength range of the dominant part of the ship roughness spectrum but is located well within the dominant part of the\niceberg and sea roughness spectra, the depolarization of the iceberg\nand sea returns relative to that from ships will be maximized.\nAs noted under "Reflectivity," the polarization ratio technique\nhas been used successfully to detect periscopes and snorkels. For\ncalm sea and grazing incidence, vertically-polarized transmitted\nradiation gave a stronger return, whereas if the sea were rough,\nhorizontally-polarized transmitted radiation gave a stronger return\n(ref. 14). In general, horizontally-polarized transmitted radiation\nwas preferred.\nC4.\n\nDoubly Reversed Circular Polarization Difference\n\nWhen a circularly polarized wave is specularly reflected by a\nsimple plane surface, the sense of rotation of the reflected wave\nis the reverse of that of the incident wave. If the incident wave\nis doubly reflected off two plane, mutually perpendicular surfaces,\n\n28\nthen the back reflected wave is circularly polarized in the same sense\nas the originally incident wave. If the incident wave undergoes three\nreflections, as in a right-angled corner, then the sense of rotation\nis reversed again and is the same as that for one reflection. Thus,\nthe sense of rotation of back reflected radiation is the reverse of that\nof the incident wave for odd numbers of reflections and is the same for\neven numbers of reflections.\nIn the far field, single reflections cover a solid angle of measure zero and, hence, are detectable only at isolated points. For a\nmonostatic radar, back reflection occurs only if the reflecting plane\nis perpendicular to the propagation direction of the incident radiation.\nDouble reflections off two mutually perpendicular planes yield back reflection along an arc lying in a plane perpendicular to the line of\nintersection of the reflecting planes and bounded by the reflecting planes.\nTriple reflections off three mutually perpendicular planes produce back\nreflection over a solid angle bounded by the planes themselves.\nSince man-made targets tend to be smooth, whereas natural targets\ngenerally are not, the double polarization reversal might be used to\ndistinguish ships from icebergs.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nSince the objective is to distinguish between ships and icebergs in\nthe simplest manner and since some of the methods cited herein may prove\nsatisfactory, more complex possibilities involving tests of statistical\nquantities (ref. 36), symmetry considerations affecting polarization\n{ref. 37}, target reconstruction from Doppler spectrum recordings (ref.\n38) or interferometry (ref. 39) have not been considered.\nAmong all possible methods for target identification, those which\ndo not require resolution of the target are preferred be ca_u..se, in practice, many targets of interest, especially those off-the flight path,\nare likely to be near or beyond the limits of resolution of radar (and\nradiometers). The polarization methods utilizing radar may require more\nthan one antenna. However, the depolarization method has already been\nfound effective for detecting small targets in a sea clutter background.\nTherefore, this method is preferred among those listed. The method of\ndoubly reversed circular polarization may also prove satisfactory. The\n\n29\nDoppler spectrum method has also been used to detect targets in a sea\nclutter background. However, there is a question as to whether Doppler\nspectra of ships and icebergs would always be sufficiently different to\npermit target identification. Among the methods for unresolved targets, the frequency-spectrum method appears least satisfactory because\nresonance reflections are not likely to be sufficiently intense to be\nclearly distinguished from the background continuous spectrum of the target.\nBecause of the wide variety of geometries possessed by ships, and\nespecially by icebergs, little attempt has been made to predict the usefulness of any of the methods by computations. The possible situations\nare too varied and the computations too difficult to reach any general\nconclusions as to which, if any, method proposed will work and is best.\nIt appears that the most desirable course of action is to select one of\nthe methods, preferably one of the polarization methods first, and to try\nit experimentally while simultaneously proceeding with detailed calculations to optimize the system.\nMicrowave radiometry may be used for target surveillance beneath\nthe aircraft, where radar resolution is poorest; whereas, elsewhere,\nradar may be used for scanning out to the horizon.\nREFERENCES\n1.
