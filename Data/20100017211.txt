An oddly\ntextured, radar-bright flow is also mapped in\nthe Sedna plains, which appears to have\noriginated from a several hundred kilometer\nlong fissure. The six coronae within V-19\nhave a total of eighteen associated flow units.\nSeveral edifice fields are also mapped, in\nwhich the small volcanic edifices both predate and postdate the other units. In addition,\nimpact crater materials and tessera materials\nare mapped.\nMultiple episodes of plains formation\nand wrinkle ridge formation dominate the\ngeologic history of the V-19 quadrangle, interspersed in time and space with edifice- and\ncorona-related volcanism. The formation of\nEistla Regio postdates most plains units,\ncausing them to be deformed by wrinkle\nridges and overlaid by corona and volcano\nflow units.\n\nIntroduction:\nA geologic map of the Sedna Planitia\n(V-19) quadrangle is being completed at the\n1:5,000,000 scale as part of the NASA Planetary Geologic Mapping Program, and will be\nsubmitted for review by September 2009.\nOverview:\nThe Sedna Planitia Quadrangle (V-19)\nextends from 25\xc2\xb0N - 50\xc2\xb0N latitude, 330\xc2\xb0 - 0\xc2\xb0\nlongitude. The quadrangle contains the northernmost portion of western Eistla Regio and\nthe Sedna Planitia lowlands.\nSeven plains materials units have been\nmapped in V-19: Sedna deformed plains material (unit pdS), Sedna patchy plains material\n(unit ppS), Sedna composite-flow plains material (unit pcS), Sedna homogeneous plains\nmaterial (unit phS), Sedna uniform plains material (unit puS), Sedna mottled plains material (unit pmS) and Sedna lobate plains material (unit plS). These seven units range from\nrelatively localized, limited extent units (e.g.\nunit pdS) to more regional plains units (e.g.\nunit phS). Similarly to other mapped quadrangles on Venus [1, 2], the quadrangle has a\nsingle regional-scale plains unit (unit phS),\nwhich dominates the northeastern half of the\nmap; the southwestern half of the map is\ndominated by the composite plains material\n(unit pcS). Each of the plains units are composed of many smaller plains units of varying\nage, which we group together to form a mappable unit. These smaller plains units have\nbeen grouped owing to their similarity in appearance and stratigraphic position relative to\nother plains units. The remaining plains units,\nunits pdS, ppS, puS, pmS and plS, tend to\ncrop out as isolated patches of materials.\n\nConclusions:\nV-19 is comparable with two of our\npreviously mapped quadrangles, V-39 and V46, in terms of the number of plains units [3,\n4]. More plains materials units have been\nmapped in our other two previously mapped\nquadrangles, V-28 and V-53, than in V-19,\nV-39 and V-46 [5, 6]. However, V-19 is also\ncomparable with V-28 and V-53, in that the\nformation of small volcanic edifices in these\nthree quadrangles is not confined to any specific time period. In addition, all three quadrangles (V-19, V-28 and V-53) have very\nhorizontal stratigraphic columns, as limited\ncontact between units prevents clear age de-\n\n11\n\nterminations. While this results in the appearance that all units formed at the same time,\nthe use of hachured columns for each unit\nillustrates the limited nature of our stratigraphic knowledge in these quadrangles, allowing for numerous possible geologic histories. The scale of resurfacing in these quadrangles is on the scale of 100s of kilometers,\nconsistent with the fact that they lie in the\nmost volcanic region of Venus.\nReferences:\n[1] Bender, K.
