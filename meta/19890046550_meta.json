While the Space Shuttle will suffice for the launch of crews to a LEO Space Station, in support of such exploration missions, cargo transport will require 500-1000 tonne annual payload capacity launchers. As a first step toward satisfaction of such requirements, NASA has undertaken the development of the Shuttle-C unmanned Space Shuttle derivative. This will be followed by the Shuttle-Z derivative-family, aimed at meeting the needs of Mars missions. Joint USAF/NASA Advanced Launch System development will allow a given launch to place 91 tonnes in LEO.", "title": "Infrastructure considerations", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T01:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890046550, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lovelace, Uriel"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Office of Exploration", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "597852a0591f4b938f127b7197c68337"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19890046550, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sumrall, Phil"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "bb6dfde521ab416495deee70de263f3d"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19890046550, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pritchard, Brian"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "ffee928f1f584749a67040ebf8513493"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890046550, "publications": [{"volume": "27", "submissionId": 19890046550, "issn": "0740-722X", "id": "9733bb8631b94fbf829fb00f34fc5046", "publicationName": "Aerospace America", "publicationDate": "1989-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
