b'New modeling approaches to investigate cell signaling in radiation response\nby\nIanik Plante and Francis A Cucinotta\n\nIonizing radiation damages individual cells and tissues leading to harmful biological effects. Among many\nradiation-induced lesions, DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are considered the key precursors of most\nearly and late effects [1] leading to direct mutation or aberrant signal transduction processes. In\nresponse to damage, a flow of information is communicated to cells not directly hit by the radiation\nthrough signal transduction pathways [2]. Non-targeted effects (NTE), which includes bystander effects\nand genomic instability in the progeny of irradiated cells and tissues, may be particularly important for\nspace radiation risk assessment [1], because astronauts are exposed to a low fluence of heavy ions and\nonly a small fraction of cells are traversed by an ion. NTE may also have important consequences clinical\nradiotherapy [3]. In the recent years, new simulation tools and modeling approaches have become\navailable to study the tissue response to radiation. The simulation of signal transduction pathways\nrequire many elements such as detailed track structure calculations, a tissue or cell culture model,\nknowledge of biochemical pathways and Brownian Dynamics (BD) propagators of the signaling\nmolecules in their micro-environment. Recently, the Monte-Carlo simulation code of radiation track\nstructure RITRACKS was used for micro and nano-dosimetry calculations [4]. RITRACKS will be used to\ncalculate the fraction of cells traversed by an ion and delta-rays and the energy deposited in cells in a\ntissue model. RITRACKS also simulates the formation of chemical species by the radiolysis of water [5],\nnotably the .OH radical. This molecule is implicated in DNA damage and in the activation of the\ntransforming growth factor beta (TGF\xce\xb2), a signaling molecule involved in NTE. BD algorithms for a\nparticle near a membrane comprising receptors were also developed and will be used to simulate\ntrajectories of signaling molecules in the micro-environment and characterize autocrine and paracrine\ncell communication and signal transduction.\nReferences:\n[1] Durante M and Cucinotta FA (2008) Nat Rev Cancer 8, 465-472.\n[2] Barcellos-Hoff MH (2005) Br J Radiol Suppl 27, 123-127.\n[3] Snyder AR (2004) Hum Exp Toxicol 23, 87-89.\n[4] Plante I et al.
