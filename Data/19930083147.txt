Warner...,\n\nThe end of the war saw every belligerent with vast stocks\nof aircraft and aircraft supplies in all stages of usefulness,\nmuch of the material being absolutely new.\n\nThe question of the\n\nbest method of getting rid of this accumulation is one which has\n\xe2\x80\x9cOeenagitattng those responsible for its disposal for more tlxm\nthree years now, but no wholly satisfactory solution has yet beeu\nreached.\nWhile the problem of the disposal of surplus material is i.,\nsome degree a technical one to be settled by experts, at the sane\nit is of such vital impoziance to the future development of\ncivil aviation wxi to the airplane industry that no one who is\nconcerned about that development can escape being interested in\ndisposal poiicies.\n\nIndeed, in a still broader sense the question\n\nis one of interest to every citizen, for the efficient and profitable disposal of $1OO,OOO,OOO worth, more or less, of aeronauti.ca.l\nmaterial is no small item in governmental economy.\nThe disposal of military airc~aft is vital to the industry\nbecause; if the Governments aircraft are to be cleared out .by\nany other mean~ than by using them to feed a bonfire, they must\nbe sold at prices with which it is impossible for the constructors\nof new equipment to compete. Unless$ then, the new airplanes are\nof such superior qualities that price is virtually no object to\nthe purchaser it will be impossible to sell them for any\n*\n\nwork\n\nTaken from the (hristian Science Monitor, August 21, 1922,\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 .\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x98r\n\n1\n.,\ni\n*\n\n-24\nwhich can be done by an adapted war pvoduct.

Great Britain has\n\n.: chosen the former plan in its most extreme form, disposal aircraft\nbeing sold there only after overhauling and then being eoSd almost\nentirely ,toforeign governments at prices only slightly below\nthose of new,aircraft. The United States, after tentative experiments with rather high prices, has thrown a Large part of what material remains.on the market for sale\n\nto\n\nthe highest bidder regard-\n\nless of price, thus going directl~-to the second of the alternatik;es\nmentioned above,\nIt is the writerls belief that the second plan is the bette~.\nSale regardless of price will save the Government money in the\nlong run, money whidi would be spent in years of storage and ca:e\nfor material some of which would ultimately prove itself unsalable\n\n-3at any price except as juxIk. It will have the merit, \xe2\x80\x9ctoo, of\n-\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x98gettingalraraft out into the hands of the public who would like\n,.,.,..\nto use them but .~re now prevented from doing so by expense.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThereare a great number of men who flew duzing the war ~.:.d\nwho would like to continue to fly$ but who are unable to pay the\ncost of a new airplane.
