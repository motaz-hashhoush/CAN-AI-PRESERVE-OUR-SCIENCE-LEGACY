With the burner configuration used in this investigation, having a mixing length of only 8 inches between the fuel manifold and the flame holder, the low-vapor-pressure fuel gave lower combustion efficiency at a given tail-pipe fuel-air ratio. Because the exhaust-nozzle area was fixed, the lower efficiency resulted in lower thrust and higher specific fuel consumption. The maximum altitude at which the burner would operate was practically unaffected by the change in fuel volatility.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930086502, "id": "9ab264fac1e94d01bdee5af217d592d8", "publicationDate": "1951-04-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930086502.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930086502/downloads/19930086502.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930086502/downloads/19930086502.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930086502/downloads/19930086502.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
