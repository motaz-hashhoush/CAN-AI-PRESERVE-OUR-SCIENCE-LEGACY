Spacecraft Commander\nThomas P. Stafford , lunar Module pilot Eugene\nCern an and Command Module Pilot John W. Young\n-flying the Command Module (CM), code-named\nCharlie Brown *-thus rang down the curtain on the\ndress rehearsal mission for the lunar landing\nwhich, if all goes well , will be made in July.\nThere were a few chilling moments when the\nlunar Module (lM), code-named Snoopy, gyrated\nwildly as the descent stage was cast off about 12\nnautical miles above the surface of the moon , but,\nnevertheless, it was a nearly flawless flight. The lM\n* The code names of Charlie Brown for the CM and Snoopy for the\nLM are taken from the popu la r com ic strip by Charles L.

The cone at bo ttom is the nozzle of the\nService Propulsion System engine.\n\ndescended to within 8.4 nautical miles of the moon\nfor a close-up inspection of the preferred landing\nsite for Apollo 11 in the Sea of Tranquility. In two\ncircuits of the moon , t he landing radar received a\nthorough checkout and the crew did extensive\nsurface photography and landmark tracking.\nOnce their low-altitude tasks were done, Stafford\nand Cernan jettisoned the descent stage, fired the\nascent engine , and flew up to join Young and the\nCommand and Service Mod ule (CSM) . The latter\nhad been monitoring the wo rk of the lM from a\nnearly circula r parking orbit of approximately 60\nnm up from the moon during the eight hours that\nthe lM had been separated from the mother ship.\nThe vital docking was smoothly executed. Although\nweary from a work-filled day, the crew did not seem\nready for sleep. They were given clearance to sleep\nlate the following day, but perhaps because of\nexcitement or the stimulus of their mission , slept\non ly five hours.\nAccomplishments\nIn swoop ing low over the moon and then executing a complicated set of orb ital maneuvers to rejoin the mother ship, the lM did everything required for a lunar landing except the actual landing\nitself. The lM demonstrat ed convinc ingly its\noperating capabilities in cislunar space and validated the two pro puls ion systems in the moon\'s\nenvironment. These are vital to the lunar landing\nmissions.\nThe first stage of the gia nt Saturn rocket. The five engines,\nred nozzles showing at bottom, produce 1.5 million\npounds of thrust each.\n\n2\n\nt\n\nOther major accomplishments included the determination that the preferred landing site is\nsmooth but that the pilots of Apollo 11\'s LM will\nhave to be accurate in touching down at the right\nspot. It was also dramatically demonstrated tha t\nmen can overcome problems in space and save a\nmission from possible disaster where instruments\nalone would fail.\nThe TV Spectacular\n\nFor the more than a billion viewers all over the\nworld, the high points of an exciting flight were the\nlive colorcasts from space. The IS-pound color TV\ncamera, specially developed for this flight, performed beyond expectations. It recorded the initial\ndocking maneuver after the Apollo and the Saturn\nthird stage had entered the lunar flight path. It\nphotographed earth from various points in space.\nIt relayed some crew activity inside the cabin of\nthe Command Module. It transmitted shots of the\nlunar surface from various angles and distances.\nIt photographed the LM in lunar orbit and generally\nmade a pictorial documentary of the flight. All\nthings considered, the images that came through\non the home receiving sets were remarkable for\ncolor fidelity and definition.\nThanks to Apollo 10, the remaining obstacles to\nachieving the national objective set 8 years ago by\nthe late President John F. Kennedy-a manned\nlunar landing before the end of the decade-have\n\nbeen cleared away. Some scientists have noted\nthat the epochal moment when an astronaut scoops\nsome moon dirt into the palm of his glove wi-ll signal a new era in the history of man.\n\nLIFTOFF AND INTO THE LUNAR TRA ECTOR\nSaturn-Apollo 10 rose-deliberately, majestically\n-from its pad on Complex 39B at precisely 12:45.5\np.m. EDT Sunday May 18. It was half a second late\naccording to the pre-launch schedule-a "delay"\nwhich occasioned some tongue-in-cheek comment\nfrom media observers. The events of the pre-orbit\nflight-the roll sequence, jettisoning the launch\nescape tower, first stage cut-off and second stage\nburn, second stage cut-off and third stage burnticked off like clockwork.\nAs the flight approached 40 nautical miles altitude, Stafford , a seasoned veteran of two Gemini\nflights, was exclaiming "What a ride!" and his crewmate Cernan , co-pilot of Gemini 9 repeated "Fantastic." Ground controllers concurred .\nAfter 11 minutes 52.8 seconds of flight, the third\nstage of the Saturn inserted the spacecraft into a\nnearly circular orbit approximately 103 nm in altitude at its high point and 100 nm at perigee. Its\n250,000-pound-thrust engine was then shut down\nand the astronauts spent two earth orbits conduct-\n\nOn the return course to Earth , the crew photographs\nthe receding Moon.\n\nEarthrise from lunar orbit.

Save\nfor a few very minor difficulties-a primary evaporator dried out, so backup equipment was switched\non to replace it-everything was working well. The\nground communications link was remarkably clear.\nOver Australia , in the 2nd orbit, the crew was\ngiven " Go" for translunar injection (TLI). The thirdstage J-2 engine was restarted and fired for 5\nminutes 42 seconds to increase the spacecraft\'s\nvelocity from its earth-orbital speed of roughly\n17,400 mph to the 24,250 mph required to put it on\na lunar course.\nOnce in a lunar trajectory, Young changed places\nwith Stafford-who had been in the middle couch\nfor the opening phase of the flight-and began the\nfinal preparatory maneuvers for the outward leg.\nYou ng separated the CSM from the adapter\nwhich houses the LM in a protective shroud atop\nthe third stage, and flew to a point 50 feet ahead\nof the still-joined LM and third stage. He then\npitched the CSM 180\xc2\xb0, in effect a half-somersault,\nso that the cone end of the CM, with its docking\npro be, pointed toward the LM. Using the CSM\nthrusters, Young flew slowly back toward the LM\nand third stage with a closing rate of three inches\na second-about 1.6 mph. Keeping the two craft\naligned, Young eased the docking probe into the\nLM\'s docking collar and the ten locking latches\nclicked into place , firmly linking the LM with the\nCM. A check of the locking latches showed that\nthey were well in place. The umbilical cords that\nconnected the LM systems with the CSM power\nsource were plugged in.\nYo ung maneuvered the linked spacecraft safely\nclear of the third stage. The latter\'s residue of fuel\nwas dumped, imparting enough additional velocity\nto the stage to put it into a different trajectory in\nwhich it would loop around the back of the moon\nand be slung into a solar orbit where it may remain until ,the end of time.\n\nfreeways. He described Alaska as being "socked\nin" with cloud cover and pointed out a low-pressure\nweather system over New England.\n\nThe Lunar Coast\nAs Apollo 10 approached the midway point on its\nlong outward coast to the moon, the astronauts\ntook advantage of a regimen confined mostly to\nroutine duties. Refreshed by what Stafford termed\n"a great night\'s sleep" and feeling "just tremendous," the spacecraft commander played a tape\nof Andy Williams singing " . . . In My Beautiful\nBalloon."\nThe mid-afternoon TV "spectacular" featured a\nvariety show interspersed with color TV of the receding earth and the astronauts inside the cabin. A\nFrank Sinatra tape of "Fly Me To The Moon" came\nover the radio, the rendition evidently suffering\nfrom having to span 130,000 miles to reach earth.\nWhen the camera was turned on Cernan, he displayed drawings of Charlie Brown in space coveralls, and his beagle Snoopy wearing the scarf of\nthe World War I fly ing ace. Next camera subject\nshowed Stafford and Young side by side-except\nthat Young was upside down. The latter appeared\nentirely at ease in his inverted position. Stafford\ndemonstrated the strange effect of weightlessness\nby moving Young up and down with little more\nthan a touch of the hand. Young quipped, "I do\neverything he tells me."\nCernan provided another weather report from\n100,000 miles in space. He noted that most of\nEurope was under a cloud cover; Portugal , Italy\n(south of Rome) and Bulgaria had clear skies as\nhad Arabia , Israel and Jordan. Most of the eastern\ncoast of the United States was cloudy.\nMore palatable food may have contributed to the\ncrew\'s high spirits. The freeze-dried diet, now\nstandard for manned flight, was supplemented by\nindividually wrapped commercial bread and the\nmakings for ham , chicken and tuna salad. But the\nThe First Color TV\nTV performance suggested t hat all the ham wasn\'t\nThe docking maneuver was highlighted with the\nin the sa lad ma ki ngs. The on Iy sour note struck by\nfirst of a series of colorcasts from space.

At Variable Speeds\nPi cture resolution was good and the color a techApollo 10\'s outward journey proceeded almost\nnological and an aesthetic triumph. Cernan identi- exactly as expected. The 24,250-mile-an-hour velocfied the Rocky Mountains, Baja California, and ity at which it entered the lunar corridor was\nasserted that he could almost see the Los Angeles steadily reduced by the gravitational drag of earth\n\nJ\n\nAt left: A westward view across Apollo Landing Site 3.\nLeft below: Mare Crisium in the highlands east of Site 2.\n\nBelow: A relatively young crater as evidenced by\nwhite ejecta .\nBelow: A large unnamed crater on the lunar backside.\n\n_ 5\n\nI\n\nto approximately 2,000 mph. Then , as the spacecraft ~ ntered the moon \'s gravitational field , the pull\nof t he moon overcame th e braking effect of the\nearth and the spacecraft picked up speed to a\npeak of 5,500 mph (relative to the moon) just before ente ri ng lunar orbit. To achieve orbit, it was\nnecessary to use the CSM Service Propulsion System- a 16,000-pound-thrust engine-i n a retro-fire\nmode, to slow the spacecraft\'s speed to roughly\n3,600 mph and permit its capture by the moon\'s\ngravitational field. Testament to the precision of\nth e fl ight out was the need fOr only one of several\nplanned mid-course corrections.\nIN LUNAR ORBIT\n\nOn May 21, Apollo 10 swept into an ell iptical\nlunar orbit with a high point D 170 and a low of 60\n\xc2\xb7\nf\nnm. Subsequently, the orbit was circularized to\napproximately 60 nm. (Ground control reported its\ndimensions as 63 by 59 nm .) Not more than 20\nmi nutes into their first orbit, the crew began vivid\ndescriptions of the lunar features over which they\nwere passing. The first comment came from Stafford who noted that they were moving out of the\nhighlands into the mare area-the so-called dry\nseas. He reported a "couple of real good volcanoes" ; an observation of considerable interest to\nastronomers because of the until-now unresolved\ncontroversy as to whether the moon had seen volcani c action at some previous time. Young described the volcanoes as " . . .. all white on the outside but defin itely black inside."\nThe first landmark the crew spotted was the Sea\nof Crisis, bathed in lunar sunrise. Young observed\nthat it really stood out and that he had no trouble\nrecognizing it. Stafford said the sides of the ridges\ncrossing the mare floor went " straight down just\nlike the Canyon Diablo in New Mexico. "\nThe crew found the " da rk" side of the moon surprisingly well lighted by earthshine and had no\ntro uble picking out landmarks. Cernan commented\nthat t he side away from the earth was "lit up like\na Christmas tree," and Stafford found the details\n" phenomenal."\nAs the spacecraft swung out from behind the\nmoon on its th ird orbi t, the crew operated the TV\ncamera for ~he sixth time and showed earth viewers\nhistoric first pictures of the moon in color. The\ncolorcast opened with views of the Sea of Smyth\non th e dark side of the moon. The initial images on\nt he TV screen were somewhat washed out, a\nphe nom en on previously noted when the sun angle\nrelat ive to the landmark was vertical. But as the\nspa cecraft moved west toward an area where the\n\nI\n\nl\n\n6\n\nLarge cra ter Firmicus at to p, with Sea of Waves\nin foreground.\n\nsun angle was oblique, surface features were\nsharply, even sta rkly, defined. As Stafford turned\nthe camera on the Sea of Fertility and the large\ncrater Langrenus, Ast ronaut Joe Engel of the support team at the Manned Space Center in Houston\ncalled the picture detail "fantastic-abso lutely unbelievable. " The crater\'s two\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7mile-high walls and\nthe 7,DDO-foot peak in its center stood out in all\nthe ir ruggedness.\nMuch of the moon \'s surface was shown to be\nroughly struct ured , grey-white and , under certain\nlighting cond itio ns, having a brownish tint. There\nwere areas of huge boulders; some of them black\nand others black and grey. The preferred landing\nsite was revealed to be free of boulders and pocked\nwith a scattering of small shallow craters, but with\nenough smooth areas for a landing. Shots of the\nearth showed its apparent si ze as somewhere between that of a golf and tennis ball.\nThursday, The Big Day\n\nMay 22nd was scheduled as a work-filled, actionpacked day for the crew. If a ything the events of\nthe day wen t beyond the plan. It began with a\nproblem . Insulation in the docking tunnel had come\nloose earlier in t he flight and clogged a vent; the\n\n_J\n\n,\nincident had let t he LM slip about 3.5\xc2\xb0 out of line\nwith the CSM in its joined posi tion. Ground contro l\nadvised the crew not to undock if the angle exceeded 7\xc2\xb0. Ground control feared that if the angle\nbecame too large, the locking latches in the docking collar would be damaged and the LM, on its return from its solo flight, would be unable to make\na sec ure hook-up with the mother ship. This would\ncreate difficulties for Stafford and Cernan\'s return\nto the CSM-the on ly component of the Apollo\nspacecraft able to return to earth and withstand\nt he extreme temperatures of re-entry.\nAs this instructi on was acknowledged, the spacecraft passed behind the moon, which ended all\ncommunication with the ground for the period it\nwas on the far side. A tension-filled 36 minutes\nfollowed, relieved only when the Apollo and the LM\nre-esta bished radio links with the ground and advised that they had successfully separated and\nwere flyin g formation-"station keeping" -some\nfifty feet apart.\nAs Stafford and Cernan readied the LM for its\ndescent to a low point only 50,000 feet from the\nmoon\'s surface, the levity and gaiety that had\ncharacterized the outward leg from earth vanished.\nThe exchange s with the ground were brief and\nworkmanlike as ,the two struggled to complete\ncertain tasks within the time allotted. Cernan sum-\n\nmarized in edgy tones, "There are so many things\nto do in such a short time."\nIt was mid-afternoon before they were ready for\nt he descent. Young in the CS M experienced momentary difficu lty getting current into the homing\nreceiver tha t wa s essential to the relay of the LM\'s\nrendezvous radar signals. He overcame the problem by recycling a power switch and reported receipt of the signals to the two pleased crewmen in\nthe LM.\nAt 4:35 p.m., EDT, the LM descent engine was\nfired in a braking mode and the LM moved toward\nan orbit the low point of which would take man\ncloser to the moon\'s surface than ever before.\nYoung kept a lonely vigil in the CSM , ready to undertake the delicate and extremely complex rescue\nmission if something went wrong with the LM.\nAmost an hour later, Cernan excitedly commented , " Hello Houston, we is down among it!"\nThe LM had reach ed a point 8.4 nm above the Sea\nof Tranquility where Apollo 11 is intended to land.\nThe two crewmen alternated with rapid-fire descriptions of the lunar surface that was passing\nbeneath them.\nWhat they saw appeared to stretch their vocabularies. The la nding site was "pretty smooth,\nlike wet clay, like a dry river bed in New Mexico or\nArizona.

Stafford took manual contro l of the\nLM and restored the proper orientation . Then the\ndescent sta ge was jetti soned , as planned , and the\nLM stabilized. Th e ep isode took some eight seconds .\n\n8\n\nAn alysis indicates t hat the problem was caused by\na malfunction in the backup guidance system . When\nthe trouble began , t he LM was under the control of\nthi s system. The system shifted its control modes\nwhich produced the LM \'s erratic beh avior. Once free\nof the descent st age , t he astronauts shifted the ascent stage to th e prim ary guidance system control\nand there were no further difficulties.\nDuring the period that the CSM and the LM were\nseparated , some communications problems arose.\nBut the astronauts and Ground Control at Houston\nworked around them and they had no adverse effect\non the fl ight.\nThe Final Rendezvous\n\nWith the LM back on its good behavior and the\njettisoning of the LM lower stage accomplished ,\nStafford and Cernan fired the ascent engine at 7:44\n\np.m., May 22nd . A 15-second-burn sent the LM into\na looping orbit above and behind the CSM . From a\nmaximum separation of 320 nm , by 10.07 p.m. they\nhad closed to within 38 nm. A sequence of three\nburns of the LM\'s small reaction -control thrusters\nbrought the LM within docking range . During the\ndocking maneuver, the LM played a passive role\nand Young linked the two spacecraft. The docking\nwas complete at 11:11 p.m. and 14 minutes later\nStafford and Cernan came through the tunnel into\nthe CSM. As Cernan emerged, he declared, "Man,\nI\'m glad I\'m getting out."\nThe LM had flown independently eight hours\nwith Stafford and Cernan standing all the while as\nif they were driving a bread truck. They were maintained in their position by a web of belts and\nharness.\n\nWhen advised of the docking, Houston control\nbroke out a large cartoon showing Snoopy kissing\nCharlie Brown . The accompanying balloon read,\n"Smack. You\'re right on target, Charlie Brown."\nWith the tunnel locked up, the LM was cast loose\nand a firing of its engine drove it into an orbit\naround the sun.\n\nA Day\'s Orbit and Return Home\nFriday, May 23, was a day of relaxation in lunar\norbit. The crew did some landmark tracking and\nworked on the lunar photography that ha~ been\nwritten into the mission. There were more colorcasts; one at 1:00 a.m. Saturday morning was\nthe best up to that point of the flight. The astronaut crew reported some minor discomfort. Fibre\nparticles floating around the cabin got under the\nspace suits and caused the astronauts to itch. It\nalso got into the crew\'s noses and throats, irritating\ntheir respiratory tracts. Stafford was uneasy for a\n\n9\n\n- _.,\n\nJust before splashdown . The Apollo spacecraft drops toward\nthe ocean surface with a Pacific sunrise as a backdrop.\n\n10\n\nThe end of the voyage.

It appeared above and in front of the CSM\n-an unwelcome companion in its dead state-then\ndropped behind.\nAt 6:25 a.m., while on the far side of the moon,\nthe crew fired the SPS to gain the velocity needed\nto escape from lunar orbit and enter the narrow\ncorridor that would take them back to the good\nearth . So exact was the burn that the speed\nachieved was only .4 mph less than planned. Houston told the crew that they "were coming right\ndown the fairway." The mid-course corrections that\nhad been written into the flight plan were eliminated as unnecessary.\nThe return leg of the flight featured more colorcasts. A few hundred miles from the moon, the\ncamera zoomed in on the huge crater Tsiolkovsky,\nnamed by the Soviets after the Russian theorist on\nrocketry. The pictures disclosed that the crater is\nfractured almost symmetrically into a number of\npie-shaped pieces. Its outside walls look chalkwhite; the inner, tan. The color of the floor is a\nchocolate brown and a pair of mountain peaks at\nthe center are white.\nThe final colorcast showed a brilliant half-disc of\nearth resplendent in blues, greens, and browns,\n\nthrough swirls of white clouds.\nWhen the camera focused on the crew, they had\nshaved. This had not been done before in space\nbecause of concern that shorn hair might escape\nin the cabin and cause difficulties with the instruments. The crew avoided this by using tube shaving cream and capturing the scrapings in swabs.\n\nAn Applauding Press\nThe U. S. press, as well as the press in other\nnations, was lavish in its flight coverage and lauded\nthe performance of the astronauts. Moscow Radio\nprovided the contrast by qualifying its wishes of\nsuccess to the crew "whose members were prepared to make up with their courage for any insufficient reliability of their aircraft."\nRecovery\nAs the Apollo 10 moved out of lunar orbH, the\nprime recovery ship, the carrier Princeton, took up\nits station 450 miles ea~ : of Samoa. The Governor\nof Samoa gave the crew a reception.\nIn the Houston control center, where the astronauts will be flown for de-briefing, a large sign\nhad been put up. It reads "51 days to launch " :a reminder (if one is needed) to all hands that the\nlunar mission is near.\n\n11\n\nCrew (:eft to right) Cernan, Young, and Stafford\n\nTHE APOLLO 10 CREW\nCo lonel Thomas P. Stafford, USAF was flying his\nthi rd mission on Apollo 10. His first mission was the\nhistory-making Gemini 6 which accomplished the\nfirst successful rendezvous of two manned,\nmaneuverable spacecraft with Gemini 7. In June\nof 1966, he flew again as command pilot of Gemini\n9 and performed three different types of rendezvo us with the unmanned Augmented Target Docking Adapte r.
