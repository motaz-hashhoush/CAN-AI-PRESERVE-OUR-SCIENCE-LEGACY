The mission of the NML is to support current government user data storage needs and assist them in getting the most efficient 'commercial' solutions in the future. The motivation for a National Media Laboratory is as follows: recording systems are the major government image and data exploitation bottleneck; government data recording performance and storage requirements lead commercial practice by 3-5 years; the supporting commercial recorder industry is large but principally focused on video not data formats; lack of standards; and lack of transfer of commercial knowledge base to program offices and operational sites.", "title": "National Media Laboratory", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:14:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930021528, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Clark, Robert"}, "organization": {"name": "National Media Lab.", "location": "Saint Paul, MN, United States"}}, "id": "64f47edfe9fe49508f0c3e872673057f"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930021528, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930021528, "id": "a9072489185946269bc224e10cfbb07e", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Technology Transfer and the Civil Space Program.
