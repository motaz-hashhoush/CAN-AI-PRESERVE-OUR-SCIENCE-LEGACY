After the capture of the spacecraft by the planet and the adjustment into a low, sun-synchronous, polar-mapping orbit in late 1993, observations will continue for a Mars year (687 days). The scientific mission centers around global geoscience and climatology observations of the Mars atmosphere, surface, and interior. The seven experiments carried by the spacecraft involve gamma-ray spectroscopy, magnetometry, surface and atmospheric imaging, atmospheric sounding, laser altimetry, gravity mapping, and thermal emission spectroscopy. All experiments contain microprocessors, which will be controlled remotely from the investigator's home institution. The long planned period of continuous 24 h/day observation promises a rich harvest of global and seasonal information. Mars Observer stands between the initial exploration of Mars and the more intensive explorations, possibly involving human beings, that are only now being planned.", "title": "Mars Observer - The next Mars mission", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T13:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920027829, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Albee, Arden L."}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology", "location": "Pasadena, United States"}}, "id": "70cb73f57a4f459b8b70c6250877b401"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920027829, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Palluconi, Frank D."}, "organization": {"name": "JPL", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "ea53fb8f49294e0d91130f1b3b24736b"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920027829, "publications": [{"volume": "28", "submissionId": 19920027829, "issn": "0022-4650", "id": "0ceceff391614e8085af2c9469a36d8e", "publicationName": "Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets", "publicationDate": "1991-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
