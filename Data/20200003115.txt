A brief overview of the Small Spacecraft Systems Virtual Institute (S3VI) and its\ncurrent activities performed in conjunction with SSTP is also provided.\nKeywords: small spacecraft missions, technology development, capability demonstrations, CubeSats\n1.0\n\nNASA SMALL SPACECRAFT TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\nAll efforts focus on small spacecraft capabilities that are relevant to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s missions in science and exploration,\nincluding those with crosscutting applications to the needs of the broader small spacecraft community in industry,\nacademia, and other government agencies. The program\xe2\x80\x99s current focus is systems for communications, propulsion,\npointing, power, and autonomous operations.\nThe program consists of four elements intended to encompass the development and demonstration of a range of\ntechnologies and capabilities and to engage the talents of the broad community of researchers and technologists from\ngovernment, industry, and academia.\nFocused Technology Development and Demonstrations: full and open solicitations for projects in development and\nflight demonstrations in focused small spacecraft technology areas such as communications and propulsion, among\nothers.\nMission Capability Demonstrations: flight demonstration projects for new mission capabilities involving both\n1\n\nAdditional information on SSTP including details of funded technology development projects and flight missions\nare available on the program\xe2\x80\x99s website: https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/small_spacecraft/index.html\n\nCEAS \xe2\x80\x93 R. Hunter\n\n1\n\ncompetitive contracts and directed NASA efforts.\nLeveraged Investments: continuation of selected projects from SBIR or other programs as well as prize challenges and\nother initiatives.\nSmallsat Technology Partnerships: a portfolio of small spacecraft technology development projects conducted by\nuniversities in collaboration with NASA centers.\nAdditionally, the Small Spacecraft Systems Virtual Institute (S3VI) provides the SSTP with expertise and support for\nstudies and workshops. Established in 2017, the S3VI advances clear communications, coordination, and consistent\nguidance regarding small spacecraft activities across NASA. The S3VI also provides the US small spacecraft research\ncommunity with access to mission enabling information and maintains engagement with small spacecraft stakeholders\nin industry and academia. Current SSTP studies supported by the S3VI are focused on communications and\npropulsion.\n2.0\n\nSMALLSAT TECHNOLOGY PARTNERSHIPS\n\nThe STP projects are principal investigator-lead collaborations between a US-based university and a partnered NASA\ncenter focused on developing transformative technologies for small spacecraft. Recurring STP partnerships are\nsolicited approximately annually and engage the unique talents and fresh perspectives of the university community\nwhile sharing NASA\xe2\x80\x99s experience and expertise to develop new technologies and capabilities for small spacecraft.\nThese STP collaborations engage NASA personnel in the rapid, agile and cost-conscious small spacecraft approaches\ncommon in academia, support university efforts, and foster a new generation of innovators for NASA and the nation.\nEach STP solicitation cycle focuses on a set of technical topics specified by NASA to increase the utility of small\nspacecraft for near-term missions and to benefit the commercial small spacecraft community. Successful proposals\nare awarded for a duration of two years with a continuation review after the first year. Typical award values are $200k\nper year for the university and a half-time position for the NASA partner, along with $25k for material procurement\nin the second year. To date, 37 STP projects have been awarded over a series of 4 solicitations.\nCompleting its fourth solicitation cycle, the STP awards cooperative agreements to spur innovations in such technical\nareas as advanced data communications, navigation, propulsion, power, thermal management, science capabilities,\nadvanced manufacturing, integrated power and thermal management systems, advanced propulsion, and de-orbit\nsystems for small spacecraft.\nThe 2018 STP solicitation specified technical topics oriented toward technologies that enable cooperative swarms and\ndeep space operations of small spacecraft. Proposals were requested in three topic areas: instrument technologies for\nsmall spacecraft; technologies that enable large swarms of small spacecraft; and technologies that enable deep space\nsmall spacecraft missions. Proposers were required to cite a relevant design reference mission; establish quantitative\ntechnical performance measures that would be required to conduct the mission; contrast the state-of-the-art for those\nperformance measures versus values targeted by their proposal; and specify how the proposed investigation would\nincrease the technical performance values toward the goal of accomplishing the referenced mission. For the 2018\nsolicitation, 111 proposals were received and 9 selected for award. The 2018 efforts are currently in their second year\nof progress.\nThe 2020 STP solicitation is currently under way. The theme chosen for the current cycle is expected to increase the\ncapabilities of small spacecraft for near-term lunar precursor and exploration missions. NASA will return humans to\nthe Moon by 2024 and thereafter establish a sustainable presence. Precursor missions of small spacecraft will blaze\nthe trail for lunar exploration and will establish infrastructure such as communications and navigation networks;\nperform on-orbit inspections; and serve to support the assembly and repair services for larger structures and lunar\nhabitats. For the 2020 STP solicitation, prospective university and NASA partners must propose development efforts\nwithin one of these 3 technology topics relevant to lunar exploration:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLunar Communications and Navigation Network: capabilities enabling small spacecraft to operate as\ncommunications or navigational nodes that are compatible with, or extend the performance of, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s planned\n\nCEAS \xe2\x80\x93 R. Hunter\n\n2\n\nSpace Communications and Navigation (SCaN) and lunar Gateway network architecture.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSmallsat Propulsion for Lunar Missions: radical improvements to propulsion systems that enable lunar orbit\nstation keeping, plane changes, or return to Earth trajectories that are compatible with secondary payload\nconstraints typical of small spacecraft.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAdvanced Electrical Power Subsystem and Thermal Management Technology: advanced power and thermal\nmanagement subsystems that solve problems for small spacecraft - typically designed for low-Earth orbit (LEO)\noperations and constrained by their small surface area for solar power collection and heat dissipation, to\nsuccessfully operate in the cislunar environment.\n\nSelection and award for the 2020 STP cycle are planned for early calendar year 2020.\n3.0 MISSION CAPABILITY DEMONSTRATIONS\n3.1 Recently Completed Missions\nNodes was a technology demonstration mission that launched to the International Space Station on December 6, 2015.\nThe two Nodes satellites that comprised the mission subsequently deployed from the station on May 16, 2016 to\ndemonstrate new network capabilities critical to the operation of swarms of spacecraft. The Nodes satellites\naccomplished all of their planned mission objectives including three technology \xe2\x80\x98firsts\xe2\x80\x99 for small spacecraft:\ncommanding a spacecraft not in direct contact with the ground by crosslinking commands through a space network;\ncrosslinking science data from one Nodes satellite to the second satellite before sending it to the ground; and\nautonomous reconfiguration of the space communications network using the capability of Nodes to automatically\nselect which satellite is best suited to serve as the ground relay each day.\nThe Optical Communications and Sensor Demonstration (OCSD) mission, a pair of CubeSats, each 1.5-units (U) in\nsize, was completed in 2019. The OCSD mission addressed two cross-cutting capabilities of value to many future\nsmall spacecraft missions: high-speed optical transmission of data and small spacecraft proximity operations. The\ndemonstration was a complete success as the technology demonstration showed data rates from the OCSD pair\nreaching up to 200 megabits per second (Mb/s), a factor of 100 increase over current high-end CubeSat\ncommunications systems. The proximity sensors developed for this mission enable relative position measurement\nbetween two small satellites - a capability not previously demonstrated.\nThe OCSD mission was launch to the station on an Orbital-ATK Crew Resupply Mission (OA-8E) in November 2017.\nThe OCSD satellites remained attached to the Crew Resupply Mission capsule until the resupply mission to the station\nwas completed in December 2017. After detaching from the station, the capsule moved to an orbit approximately 100\nkm higher than the station and deployed the OCSD technology demonstration. The OCSD pair entered systems\ncheckout after deployment with the demonstrations of the laser communications experiment continuing throughout\n2018 and into 2019.\nSimilar to the OCSD launch and deployment, the Integrated Solar Array and Reflectarray Antenna (ISARA)\ntechnology demonstration was launched to the station alongside OSCD in November 2017, and subsequently deployed\nfrom the Orbital ATK Crew Resupply capsule in December 2017. The ISARA mission demonstrated a reflectarray\nantenna that increases downlink data rates for CubeSats from the existing baseline rate of 9.6 kilobits per second (kb/s)\nto more than 100 megabits per second (Mb/s).\nThe reflectarray antenna consists of three panels, electrically tied together through hinges, which have an array of\nprinted circuit board patches on them. The patch size is adjusted so that the phase of the reflected feed illumination\ncollimates the radiation in much the same way a parabolic dish reflector would. Unlike a parabolic dish, however, the\nreflectarray panels are flat, which enabled them to be folded down against the CubeSat. On the opposite side of the\nprinted reflectarray antenna, solar cells were added. This makes the overall antenna/solar array panel assembly slightly\nthicker, but the cells are stowed in the \xe2\x80\x9cdead space\xe2\x80\x9d between the launch rails that would have otherwise been left\nempty. This combination of antenna and solar cells makes for a very efficient use of CubeSat volume, leaving plenty\nof room for payloads such as science instruments or imaging systems. Like OCSD, the technology demonstration\n\nCEAS \xe2\x80\x93 R. Hunter\n\n3\n\ncontinued through summer 2018 ending in the successful completion of experiment objectives. Within five months of\nspacecraft checkout functions, the ISARA spaceflight demonstration verified antenna performance to technology\nreadiness level 7 and 100 Mb/s data rate capability [3]. When the ISARA technology demonstration mission completed\nin summer 2018, the hosted payload mission began.\n3.2 Hosted-Payload on ISARA\nThe ISARA CubeSat mission, managed by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), operated by The Aerospace\nCorporation (Aerospace), and sponsored by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s SSTP, was the first successful in space technology demonstration\nof a reflectarray antenna. The antenna\xe2\x80\x99s space-saving, flat-panel design allowed for the CubeSat Multispectral\nObserving System (CUMULOS) to fly as a secondary payload [4], as detailed in the following:\nAn Aerospace-developed technology, CUMULOS is the first infrared sensor flown as part of Aerospace\xe2\x80\x99s\nAeroCube program which allows infrared weather imagery to be studied by a small satellite. Made of three\ncompact cameras with lenses an inch or less in diameter, CUMULOS has a visible wavelength camera, a shortwavelength infrared camera, and a long-wavelength infrared, microbolometer camera [4].\nThe CUMULOS payload was a late-addition to the ISARA mission and is an example of the agility of the SSTP to\naccept rideshare payloads late-in-the-development of the main CubeSat mission.\nAn impromptu demonstration of opportunity was realized in April 2019 when the OCSD-B flight vehicle was used in\nconjunction with the CUMULOS payload aboard the ISARA flight vehicle. The demonstration of opportunity showed\nthat the OCSD-B flight vehicle could accurately point and lase the CUMULOS payload, onboard ISARA, at a distance\nof over 2200 km. This is believed to be a first in which a CubeSat, with a laser communications capability, was able\nto point with sufficient accuracy at another CubeSat from a great distance [5].\n3.3 Upcoming Missions\nUpcoming SSTP missions include the CubeSat Proximity Operations Demonstrations (CPOD) mission, notionally\nplanned for launch in 2020. During this mission, SSTP will conduct an in-orbit demonstration of rendezvous,\nproximity operations, and docking (RPOD) of two 3U CubeSats. Each CubeSat is a satellite with the dimensions 4 x\n4 x 13 in. (10 x 10 x 33 cm) and weighing approximately 11 pounds (5 kg). This flight demonstration will validate\nand characterize many new miniature low-power proximity operations technologies applicable to future missions. The\nmission will advance the state of the art in nanosatellite attitude determination, navigation and control systems, in\naddition to demonstrating relative navigation capabilities. CPOD will demonstrate the ability of the two spacecraft to\nremain at determined points relative to each other, which is known as relative station keeping. CPOD will also\ndemonstrate precision circumnavigation and docking. Docking will employ the use of a novel universal docking\ndevice, imaging sensors, and a multi-thruster cold gas propulsion system. The two CPOD satellites are scheduled to\nbe launched together to low-Earth orbit in the first half of calendar year 2020.\nMany of CPOD\xe2\x80\x99s proximity operations test scenarios will be performed autonomously using high-performance, onboard processors and flight software. The satellite design leverages existing and next-generation, high-performance\nsystems, including sensors and flight software for guidance, navigation and control. The CPOD satellites have 3-axis\nattitude determination and control, and large power charging capacity and storage. The system also contains a halfduplex (one-way communication) ultra-high frequency communications system with a high-speed, S-band downlink\nfor payload data transfer.\nThe two CPOD satellites will be deployed into orbit simultaneously while attached side-by-side and will initially\nundergo a series of checkout steps to ensure proper operation and maneuvering capability. Once the initial checkout\nis complete, the two spacecraft will then release from each other and will begin the proximity operations maneuvers.\nThe space-to-ground data link from each satellite will enable transmission of images of the other satellite. The two\nspacecraft will use an inter-satellite link to share GPS and other data.\nUsing on-board navigation systems, one satellite will perform a series of circumnavigation maneuvers relative to the\nsecond satellite in order to validate and characterize performance of the new miniature sensors. After the sensors have\nbeen characterized, the chaser satellite will begin closing the distance to the first satellite during a series of planned\n\nCEAS \xe2\x80\x93 R. Hunter\n\n4\n\nmaneuvers. Finally, when they have reached a close relative range, they will conduct the last portion of the mission\nby engaging the docking mechanism and performing a full docking of the two spacecraft.\nAnother upcoming mission is the Lunar Flashlight (LF) mission planned to launch on the Space Launch System\xe2\x80\x99s\nExploration Mission-1 (EM-1) flight, now referred to as Artemis-1. Lunar Flashlight is an exciting new mission\nconcept, originally selected by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Advanced Exploration Systems (AES), and now sponsored by SSTP. The LF\nmission is led by a team from JPL and the Marshall Space Flight Center. This innovative, low-cost secondary payload\nconcept will map the lunar south pole for volatiles and will demonstrate several technological firsts, including being\nthe first CubeSat to reach the Moon; the first planetary CubeSat mission to use green propulsion; and the first mission\nto use lasers to look for water ice [6]. Figure 1 depicts an artist's concept showing the Lunar Flashlight spacecraft at\nthe Moon.\n\nFig. 1 This artist's concept shows the Lunar Flashlight spacecraft, a 6-unit CubeSat designed to search for ice on the\nMoon's surface using special lasers. The spacecraft will use its near-infrared lasers to shine light into shaded polar\nregions on the Moon, while an onboard reflectometer will measure surface reflection and composition.\nImage credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nThe Advanced Composite Solar Sail System (ACS3), another technology demonstration mission scheduled in the\nnear-term, will serve as a pathfinder for a future large solar sail (approximately 500 square meters). The ACS3 mission\nwill demonstrate a first use of composite booms as well as sail packing and deployment systems for a solar sail in\norbit. Also developed for ACS3 is an innovative tape-spool boom extraction system to minimize blossoming, or\njamming, of the coiled booms during deployment. NASA anticipates flying ACS3, in LEO, in the 2021-2022\ntimeframe.\n4.0 NASA SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM and SMALL BUSINESS\nTECHNOLOGY TRANSFER\nThe NASA SBIR and STTR programs fund the research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologies\nthat fulfill NASA needs as described in the annual solicitations and have significant potential for successful\ncommercialization. Definitions related to SBIR and STTR, as pertains to NASA, are available on the programs\xe2\x80\x99\nwebsite [7] and subtopics examples from an earlier solicitation are offered for reference [8].\n\nCEAS \xe2\x80\x93 R. Hunter\n\n5\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s technology, science, exploration, and space operations organizations periodically identify a growing number\nof potential applications for very small spacecraft. Such spacecraft can accomplish missions at a fraction of the cost\nof larger conventional spacecraft and can be developed quickly and more responsively. In some cases, their small size\nand ability to be delivered in relatively large numbers may enable mission applications not possible with larger\nsatellites. A small spacecraft can also serve as a low-cost platform for spaceflight testing of new technologies that are\nappropriate for spacecraft of any size.\nSome of the features that are desirable for small spacecraft technologies across all system areas are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSimple design\nHigh reliability\nLow cost or short time to develop\nLow cost to procure flight hardware when technology is mature\nSmall system volume or low mass\nLow power consumption in operation\nSuitable for rideshare launch opportunities or storage in habitable volumes (minimum hazards)\nTolerant of extreme thermal and/or radiation environments\nAble to be stored in space for several years prior to use\nHigh performance relative to existing system technology [8]\n\nFor additional reference, the following website discusses some of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s small spacecraft technology activities:\nwww.nasa.gov/smallsats [9]\nAnother useful reference is the Small Spacecraft Technology State of the Art Report available at:\nhttps://sst-soa.arc.nasa.gov [10]\nTable 1, below, provides a list of the 2018 Phase II Awardees for Small Business Innovative Research for a NASA\nsolicitation for small-satellite technologies [11].\n\nTable 1 Small Business Innovative Research 2018 Phase II Awardees\nAWARDEE\n\nTECHNOLOGY TITLE\nHigh-Impulse, Scalable, Metal Plasma Thruster for CubeSat Missions\n\n2\n\nAlameda Applied Sciences\nCorporation\nBlink Astro, LLC\n\n3\n\nBusek Company, Inc.\n\nLow Impulse Bit Electrospray Thruster Control\n\n4\n\nExoTerra Resource, LLC.\n\nModular Xenon Micro Electric Propulsion System\n\n5\n\nFibertek, Inc.\n\nTechnologies Enabling Distributed Spacecraft Missions (DSM)\n\n6\n\nMasten Space Systems, Inc.\n\nPermiAM; Engineered Porosity In-Situ with Fully Dense AM Structure\n\n1\n\nDelay-Tolerant Radio for Cooperative Groups of Small Spacecraft\n\n5.0 REFERENCES\n1\n2\n3\n\nNASA Small Spacecraft Technology Program.
