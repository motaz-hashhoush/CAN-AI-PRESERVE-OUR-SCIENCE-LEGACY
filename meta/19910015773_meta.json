A significant concern to the spacecraft designer is the possibility of metal to metal coldwelding or significant increases in friction. Coldwelding can occur between atomically clean metal surfaces when carefully prepared in a vacuum chamber on earth. The question is whether coldwelding occurs in orbit service conditions. The results of the System Special Investigation Group's (SIG's) investigation into whether coldwelding had occurred on any Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) hardware are presented. The results of a literature search into previous ground based anomalies is also presented. Results show that even though there have been no documented on-orbit coldwelding related failures, precautions should be taken to ensure that coldwelding does not occur in the space environment and that seizure does not occur in the prelaunch or launch environment.", "title": "On-orbit coldwelding", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:37:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910015773, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dursch, Harry"}, "organization": {"name": "Boeing Aerospace and Electronics Co.", "location": "Seattle, WA, United States"}}, "id": "45d90d08b81f4206979ddfe4f105c851"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910015773, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Spear, Steve"}, "organization": {"name": "Boeing Aerospace and Electronics Co.", "location": "Seattle, WA, United States"}}, "id": "7be731e74e8044a69f9923a070ca83c9"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910015773, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910015773, "id": "b2f864f7df364479aaa133e3dd171620", "publicationName": "NASA, Langley Research Center, First LDEF Post-Retrieval Symposium Abstracts", "publicationDate": "1991-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19910015658, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "First LDEF Post-Retrieval Symposium abstracts", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
