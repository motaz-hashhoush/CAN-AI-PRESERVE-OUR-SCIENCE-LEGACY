The addition of a data warehouse as a strategic component to the PRMS is investigated through the analysis design and implementation processes of a data warehouse prototype. As a proof of concept, a demonstration of the prototype with its OLAP's technology for multidimensional data analysis is made. The results of the data analysis and the design constraints are discussed. The prototype can be used to motivate interest and support for an operational data warehouse.", "title": "PRMS Data Warehousing Prototype", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T09:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20010110013, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Guruvadoo, Eranna K."}, "organization": {"name": "Bethune-Cookman Coll.", "location": "Daytona Beach, FL United States"}}, "id": "d9d4ac0679874cea9c3cef2586bd07d3"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20010110013, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010110013, "id": "0d0fa2cf0e474b9f9d3d47891dd81a48", "publicationName": "2000 Research Reports: NASA/ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program", "publicationDate": "2001-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20010110007, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "2000 Research Reports: NASA/ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
