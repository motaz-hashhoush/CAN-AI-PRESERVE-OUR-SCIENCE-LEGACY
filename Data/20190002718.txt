Most wind measurements come from atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs)\nby tracking the displacement of cloud or water vapor features. These AMVs generally rely on thermal\ninfrared (IR) techniques for their height assignments, which are subject to large uncertainties in the\npresence of weak or reversed vertical temperature gradients near the planetary boundary layer (PBL)\nand tropopause folds. Stereo imaging can overcome the height assignment problem using geometric\nparallax for feature height determination. In this study we develop a stereo 3D-Wind algorithm\nto simultaneously retrieve AMV and height from geostationary (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO)\nsatellite imagery and apply it to collocated Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)\nand Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) imagery. The new algorithm improves AMV and\nheight relative to products from GOES or MISR alone, with an estimated accuracy of <0.5 m/s in AMV\nand <200 m in height with 2.2 km sampling. The algorithm can be generalized to other LEO-GEO\nor LEO-LEO combinations for greater spatiotemporal coverage. The technique demonstrated with\nMISR and GOES has important implications for future high-quality AMV observations, for which a\nlow-cost constellation of CubeSats can play a vital role.\nKeywords: 3D-Winds; atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs); MISR; GOES-R; planetary boundary\nlayer (PBL); stereo imaging; parallax; CubeSats\n\n1. Introduction\nAtmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) derived by tracking cloud and water vapor features in\nsatellite imagery have been one of the key observations used in numerical weather prediction\n(NWP) systems [1,2]. The impact of AMVs on forecasts is the greatest in the tropics, Southern\nHemisphere, and regions where data are otherwise sparse. In addition to the tropics, Gelaro and\nZhu [3] identi\xef\xac\x81ed other regions where forecast error is most sensitive in observing system experiments\n(OSEs). These regions are often associated with strong atmospheric energetics and baroclinic instability\nwhere radiosonde data are sparse and NWP must depend heavily on satellite AMVs. One of the main\nuncertainties associated with the AMV measurements is the height assignment, which can prevent\nAMVs from being assimilated into NWP systems, especially in the presence of a strong vertical wind\nshear and complex thermal structures (e.g., tropopause folding, boundary layer inversion). Accuracy\nof height assignment was assessed in a number of studies by comparing Moderate Resolution Imaging\nSpectroradiometer (MODIS) and geostationary satellite cloud top heights (CTHs) with CTHs from\nthe Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument and other independent\nmeasurements [4\xe2\x80\x937].\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1885; doi:10.3390/rs10121885\n\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1885\n\n2 of 36\n\nThe AMV technique has several key assumptions and limitations regarding tracked atmospheric\nfeatures (e.g., clouds, water vapor) and the interpretation of their evolution as winds. Fundamentally,\nfeatures are assumed to be traveling together with the wind so that feature motion is equal to air\nmotion and therefore such features are assumed to be passive tracers [8]. This assumption can break\ndown in the case of standing waves, such as orographic waves, where clouds anchor on the top of\nmountains. Feature patterns that are tracked must be distinctive, neither uniform nor periodic, so that\nthey can be uniquely identi\xef\xac\x81ed from one location to another. A uniform feature will lead to no solution\nin pattern matching whereas a wavy pattern can lead to multiple solutions. To be considered the same\nfeature, no major distortion in feature patterns should occur over consecutive images. Clouds may\nchange shape or grow over the period of consecutive images but must not change shape so much as to\nbe unrecognizable as the previous pattern. This requirement may be limited by latitude-dependent\ncloud spatiotemporal variability. Generally, vertical motion is neglected; although atmospheric features\ncan grow vertically during a several-minute tracking interval, the resulting motion from tracking\nfeatures in consecutive images is assumed to be due to horizontal motion only. Finally, each AMV\nis generally assigned one height in the atmosphere that would represent where the pattern becomes\noptically thick. The assigned height can be considered the cloud top if tracking a cloud pattern. In the\ncase of multiple cloud layers and particularly when the top layer is semitransparent as with cirrus\nclouds, the pattern matcher picks the layer offering the strongest contrast as the pattern height.\nIn this paper, we show the bene\xef\xac\x81t of data fusion from geostationary (GEO) and low-earth orbit\n(LEO) satellites for producing high quality three-dimensional (3D) AMVs with a multi-platform,\nmulti-angle stereoscopic technique. We use the term \xe2\x80\x9c3D Winds\xe2\x80\x9d primarily to signify the positioning\nof horizontal AMVs three-dimensionally in the atmosphere, but we also examine relaxation of\nthe horizontal constraint in our retrieval algorithm. We demonstrate the bene\xef\xac\x81ts of our 3D-Winds\nalgorithm using data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument and the new\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite series-R (GOES-R) satellites over the Contiguous\nUnited States (CONUS). The AMVs jointly retrieved from MISR and GOES-16/17 show signi\xef\xac\x81cant\nimprovements in AMV and height measurement quality relative to AMVs from GOES or MISR alone.\nThe results from this study highlight the potential of synergistic observations between advanced GEO\nimagers and a LEO constellation of CubeSat multi-angle sensors for future 3D global wind observations.\n2. AMVs and Height Assignments\nThe primary infrared (IR) methods used for AMV height assignment are the IR window [9],\nCO2 slicing [10,11], and H2 O intercept [12,13] techniques. One approach to the IR-window method\nassumes that the mean of the lowest 20% (coldest) brightness temperature values in the target sample\nis the temperature at the cloud top. This temperature is compared to a numerical forecast of the\nvertical temperature pro\xef\xac\x81le to determine the cloud height. The cross-correlation contribution (CCC)\nmethod is a variation on the IR-window method. CCC assigns the height using temperatures of pixels\nranked according the importance of their contribution to the pattern-matching solution [14]. In the\ncase of opaque clouds, the sensed temperature used by the IR-window method will be representative\nof the modeled temperature at the pressure level (or height) of the tracked cloud top; however,\nthe IR-window method is known to be challenged in the presence of semitransparent clouds for which\nthis is not necessarily true [15]. The CO2 -slicing method is intended to work well for both opaque and\nsemitransparent clouds. Cloudy and clear radiance differences in one or more carbon dioxide bands\n(e.g., 13.3, 13.6, 13.9, or 14.2 \xc2\xb5m on MODIS) and infrared window bands are ratioed and compared\nto the theoretical ratio of the same quantities for a range of cloud pressures. The cloud pressure that\ngives the best match between the observed and theoretical ratios is chosen. Zhang and Menzel [16]\nproposed an improved CO2 -slicing method by taking into account cloud emissivity. The H2 O-intercept\nmethod of height determination can be used as an additional metric or in the absence of a CO2 band.\nThis method examines the relationship between clusters of clear and cloudy pixel values in water\nvapor-infrared window brightness temperature space, predicated on the fact that radiances from a\n\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1885\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\n3 of 36\n3 of 37\n\nfrom a single cloud two spectral bands bands vary linearly with cloud fraction a pixel.

For example, the height determination from the stereo technique is insensitive to atmospheric\ntemperatures and is therefore not limited by atmospheric thermal structures or complex surface types\nas with thermal IR techniques. However, the height assignment from stereo-photogrammetry is\nsensitive to image registration errors. Improvements in registration accuracy have been made with\nthe new generation of GEO imagers represented by GOES-16 and Himawari-8, which assures that\nstereo-photogrammetry will be a valuable technique.\nThe MISR instrument (2000-present) offers nine viewing angles (Nadir, \xc2\xb126\xe2\x97\xa6 , \xc2\xb146\xe2\x97\xa6 , \xc2\xb160\xe2\x97\xa6 , \xc2\xb170\xe2\x97\xa6 ),\neach designated by a letter (An, Aa, Af, Ba, Bf, Ca, Cf, Da, Df), in four spectral bands (446, 558,\n672, 866 nm) and with global coverage in swaths of ~350 km [26\xe2\x80\x9329]. LEO stereo-photogrammetry\nusing MISR produces winds and cloud heights from disparities (i.e., apparent relative shifts of\nfeatures) between camera pairs, speci\xef\xac\x81cally Bf-to-An, Bf-to-Df, Ba-to-An and Ba-to-Da. MISR measures\nwind and cloud heights using all the disparities (i.e., apparent relative shifts of features) from\nits nine angular views. The disparities from the oblique angles, bene\xef\xac\x81ting from the curvature of\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s surface along track, break the degeneracy between along-track wind and cloud height\nin MISR wind retrievals [27]. However, the independence of the two retrieved quantities is not\nperfect, which produces correlated errors in the along-track wind and its height assignment [26,28].\nThe retrieved height error is proportional to the along-track wind error by a factor of 75\xe2\x80\x9393 m for every\n1 m/s [30].\nAdding independent views from another satellite also helps to remove the degeneracy between\nalong-track wind and height, which is inherent in multi-angle observations from a single LEO platform,\nbut also introduces problems of working with data from systems that have different characteristics\nand spatial resolutions. This paper shows that such problems can be solved in our newly-developed\n3D-Wind algorithm. Here we demonstrate joint AMV and height retrieval with collocated MISR\nand GOES imagery, to show that the resulting products are more accurate than those derived from\neither MISR or GOES alone. This LEO-GEO matching has become attractive in light of the advanced\nhigh-resolution imaging sensors and high-accuracy pointing from GEO as represented by GOES-16\nand Himawari-8. This study is the \xef\xac\x81rst attempt to use high-quality LEO-GEO retrievals to characterize\nthe quality of current LEO and GEO AMV products.\n3. Multi-Angle and Multi-Platform Methods and Results\nObservation of the parallax of a feature when observed from two different vantage points (or\nstereo) provides direct information about its height independent of atmospheric models and thermal\nstructures. The stereo technique has advantages over the passive thermal IR approach in determining\na feature\xe2\x80\x99s height. It avoids any dependence on atmospheric thermal structure, and thus avoids the\npotential for large errors in height assignment at mid-to-high latitudes or in the boundary layer where\nthe temperature lapse rate is small or reversed (e.g., [5,7]).\nWe \xef\xac\x81rst discuss GEO-GEO combinations considering the GOES constellation and then explore\nLEO-GEO combinations with MISR and GOES in some detail in the following subsections. LEO-LEO\ncombinations can also be used to perform stereo imaging. For example, MODIS on Terra and Aqua\ncan obtain a triplet of imagery in ~1.5 h to produce AMV measurements at latitudes poleward of\n70\xe2\x97\xa6 . There is an existing MODIS-MODIS polar AMV algorithm that is fully automated, and the\nproduct, available since September 2002, has been used operationally for weather forecasting [31].\nHowever, the algorithm uses a priori height assignments to correct for parallax to improve wind\nvectors instead of using the parallax to solve for height. This polar AMV dataset has been especially\nvaluable because it provides coverage outside the range of coverage by the GEO constellation. There is\na ~10\xe2\x97\xa6 gap in latitude coverage between GEO and polar AMVs, since the spatial coverage is generally\nequatorward of 60\xe2\x97\xa6 latitude for GEO satellites and poleward of 70\xe2\x97\xa6 latitude for the polar satellites.\nWithin this latitudinal gap, the dynamically active polar jet stream can often be found, and the lack of\nobservations can lead to poor model initialization and rapidly growing errors in the forecasts. Research\n\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1885\n\n5 of 36\n\nhas shown that the addition of the polar winds can be especially important in the active polar jet stream\nregion [32,33]. To \xef\xac\x81ll this gap, a GEO-LEO algorithm was developed, which requires an advanced\nimage compositing technique to blend the data from a variety of satellites: GEO (GOES, Meteosat,\nMTSAT) and LEO satellites (NOAA-15 through NOAA-19 and Metop-A; NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Terra and Aqua).\nThe GEO-LEO AMVs can be produced at the best spatial resolution from composite images of different\nsatellites that vary in sampling time and viewing angle [34]. These satellite image composites are\nbeing routinely generated every 15 min for infrared window channels at 4 km resolution in polar\nstereographic projection over each pole. Like other AMVs, the GEO-LEO AMVs are derived from\ntracking a triplet of images separated by 30\xe2\x80\x9345 min from these composites.\nOther sensor combinations can be exploited to augment the polar 3D-Wind capability as well,\nincluding MODIS with the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) [35] and paired Advanced Very High\nResolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments on the Metop series [36].\n3.1. GEO-GEO Multi-Platform Winds\nThe idea of using stereo imaging to observe clouds in 3D where there is simultaneous and\noverlapping coverage by two GEO spacecraft was described by Hasler [21]. We continued with this\nconcept to make quantitative retrievals of CTH from the legacy GOES constellation as an internal\nresearch and development (IR&D) project at Carr Astronautics [37] using archival imagery from\nGOES-13, -14, and -15 of Hurricane Sandy. The motivation for our work was to demonstrate that a\nstereo CTH product could be suf\xef\xac\x81ciently accurate to be useful as an operational product, particularly\nwith the advanced capabilities expected from GOES-R. At the time of Sandy, GOES-13 and -15 were\nbeing operated as the eastern and western satellites, respectively, and GOES-14, in a storage orbit\nover a central longitude, was taken out and put in operation for a test campaign. This con\xef\xac\x81guration\nprovided coverage across much of the northern hemisphere by two satellites and much of the CONUS\nby three satellites. We developed a linear cloud height retrieval algorithm that derived CTH from\nsingle or paired parallax measurements made by matching templates from GOES-14 against GOES-13\nand -15 imagery.\nThe key enabling parameters for high-quality stereo-CTH retrievals from two GEO satellites are\nthe spatial resolution and Image Navigation and Registration (INR), which permit accurate positioning\nof features with respect to absolute geographic coordinates. The results using the GOES visible\nchannel across the northern hemisphere are promising after applying corrections for some INR-related\nsystematic errors so that the measured height over clear-sky terrain matched a terrain model.\nThis provided a necessary validation of the INR performance over the legacy GOES constellation [38],\nfor which both INR and spatial resolution are improved in the GOES-R series [39]. We compared\nthe CTH retrievals from GOES stereo imaging against CALIOP laser altimetry [40] when CALIOP\ntraversed nearly coincident GOES scenes (Figure 2).\nThe stereo method for CTH retrievals was further extended to include tracking pattern motions\nbetween consecutive images using the same pattern-matching algorithm. We modeled pixel times and\nsimultaneously solved for both AMVs and height from the observed disparities in the cloud patterns.\nThe new capability yielded \xef\xac\x81rst CONUS and later full-disk 3D-Wind products [41]. This version is the\npredecessor of the 3D-Winds algorithm that we will discuss in depth in Section 3.2. Figure 3 shows\nan example of a two-satellite full-disk product using GOES-13 (75\xe2\x97\xa6 W) and GOES-16 when it was\npositioned at 89.5\xe2\x97\xa6 W for testing. A large part of the full disk is covered in their overlap since the two\nsatellites are only 15\xe2\x97\xa6 apart. For two GEO AMVs, there always is a tradeoff between the accuracy of\nheight retrievals and breadth of coverage.\n\nvisible channel across the northern hemisphere are promising after applying corrections for some\nINR-related systematic errors so that the measured height over clear-sky terrain matched a terrain\nmodel.

This is the foundation of the approach to operational MISR\n\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1885\n\n8 of 36\n\nthe different cameras of MISR and the ABI when projected onto the ellipsoid, as is the case with\nellipsoid-recti\xef\xac\x81ed imagery, are assigned different geographic coordinates. Therefore, an object will\nappear to be displaced relative to a reference camera. In general, this apparent displacement or\ndisparity, can be attributed to motion of the object during the time between looks, 3D parallax, or a\ncombination thereof. This is the foundation of the approach to operational MISR cloud heights and\nwinds [43]. Here, we designate the MISR nadir-looking (An) camera to be our reference and pattern\nmatch to the other MISR cameras and three repetitions of an ABI CONUS scene. MISR brings excellent\nobservability of cloud height with some mixing between along-track winds and height, and GOES\nbrings excellent observability of cloud motion; together, the full 3D geometry of clouds and their\nmotion are well observed.\nThe MISR GRP_ELLIPSOID imagery is rendered over the Space Oblique Mercator (SOM)\nprojection [44]. Before attempting pattern matching with ABI, we \xef\xac\x81rst remap a relevant subset of\nABI imagery from its native ABI \xef\xac\x81xed grid into the MISR SOM projection with the resolution of the\nMISR red band. ABI B02 imagery has a nadir resolution of 500 m in comparison with the 275 m\nresolution of the MISR red band, which means that patterns appear somewhat blurry in the remapped\nABI imagery as compared to the MISR red band; however, they can still be matched. We are using\nan optimized Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) algorithm [45] to identify matches and measure\ndisparities. Subpixel resolution is achieved by modeling the correlation surface in the neighborhood\nof its maximum as a quadratic surface and interpolating [46]. We cover each 512 \xc3\x97 2048 block of\nAn-camera imagery with a uniform mesh using an 8-pixel sampling (2.2 km). Templates of 40 \xc3\x97\n40 pixels are matched to measure disparities. This simple approach provides ample matches from\nwhich to retrieve 111,894 3D-Wind vectors in Figure 4b, although more sophisticated means of feature\nselection, template sizing, and matching may have advantages and potentially measure atmospheric\nmotion at different spatial scales.\nThe algorithm nominally measures disparities from the MISR aft- and forward-looking cameras\nto nadir (Aa-to-An, Af-to-An), and between each of a triplet of sequential GOES CONUS scenes and\nAn for which the middle of the GOES temporal triplet is as close to a simultaneous match to An as\npossible, but it is possible to match with the MISR B, C, and D cameras as well. Modeling the time\nassociated with each template and its match is critical to a successful 3D-Wind retrieval. Since we\nwork with resampled products, times for pixels have only an approximate meaning. The centers of\nMISR blocks are time tagged within the MISR GRP_ELLIPSOID product and we can therefore deduce\ntheir approximate pixel times by assuming a nearly linear advance of time between block centers\nalong the ground track. Assigning times to GOES pixels is slightly more complicated and requires\ndetailed knowledge of the operation of ABI as it follows its timeline. ABI L1b product times always\nreference the start of each scene for B02. We know the pattern of coverage by swaths and the release of\nfragments from the pipelined resampling process within the ABI Ground System [47] and can therefore\ngenerally assign a swath number to each product row with some con\xef\xac\x81dence. This allows for reliable\ntime assignments except near swath seams where there is in general some ambiguity about which\nswath a product pixel belongs. Despite this complication, a substantial majority of GOES product\npixels can be time tagged with an accuracy that is adequate for LEO-GEO AMV retrievals as we will\nshow. Since there is no synchronization between MISR and GOES, the An-camera block can be out of\nphase with the GOES scene nearest in time by as much as \xc2\xb1 1 of the GOES refresh period and will vary\n2\nfrom one block to the next.\nA geometric retrieval is the \xef\xac\x81nal step in the 3D-Winds algorithm. Each template yielding a\nmatch across the intended subset of MISR cameras and the GOES triplet quali\xef\xac\x81es as a site for a\nretrieval. A prescreening is performed for data quality before the retrieval and screening after retrieval\nto verify that the model adequately explains the set of measured disparities at each site. The \xef\xac\x81rst\nprescreening is an autocorrelation test of the template being matched with the An-camera image from\nwhich it came. This test helps to eliminate featureless areas such as those over water under clear skies\nwhere an autocorrelation can show a large nonsensical disparity. The next screening is performed on\n\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1885\n\n9 of 36\n\npeak correlation coef\xef\xac\x81cient relative to threshold values. In rare cases, the NCC correlation surface\ninterpolation algorithm may fail because the modeled quadratic surface is a saddle surface and such\ncases are screened out as interpolation is impossible. Finally, a consistency check is carried out for the\ndisparities between those measured with forward and aft-looking camera pairs and between forward\nand backward temporal differences in the GOES imagery. The prescreening in the 3D-Wind algorithm\n\xef\xac\x81lters out most disparities for which no sensible interpretation can be derived and enables statistical\noutlier testing on the residuals after retrieval to be effective in removing the rest.

Table 1 summarizes\nthe clear-sky statistics for retrievals over P024 and P040 using either GOES-16 or -17. P008 is not\nconsidered as it is mostly over water while passing over the GOES CONUS scene and therefore its\nclear-sky terrain statistics are sparse. All paths traverse land with terrain heights ranging from zero\nto ~3 km, therefore, sampling retrieved heights up to ~3 km but necessarily only stationary targets.\nThe clear-sky terrain data for P024O098797 are shown in Figure 9. This path traverses the Great Plains,\nGulf of Mexico, and a small mountainous portion of Central America as can be seen in Figure 4a.\nAll retrievals below ~5 km and not over water have been plotted versus the underlying terrain height.\n\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1885\n\n13 of 36\n\nThe separation of the clear-sky class from the other data is rather obvious in Figure 9b and the clear-sky\nclass falls cleanly on a regression line with slope ~1. Errors in the height retrievals are estimated from\nthis class by simply differencing the retrieved height from the terrain height. The difference histogram\nresembles a normal distribution (Figure 9a). For the velocity error statistics (Figure 9c,d), the class\nheight limit is adjusted to be 3\xcf\x83 above the mean height error (apparent true ground level) and apparent\nvelocity bounds are relaxed from 0.3 m/s to 2 m/s to admit to the sample retrievals with larger errors\nin the relevant variable. There are generally small but statistically signi\xef\xac\x81cant biases in the heights and\nvelocities retrieved for these apparently stationary ground sites from which we can estimate that the\npattern height and velocity errors for A-camera plus GOES-16/17 retrievals are respectively less than\nabout 200 m and 0.5 m/s. Retrievals using cloud patterns instead of terrain may possess additional\nuncertainties, which is a point made by Lonitz and Horv\xc3\xa1th [53] in their analysis of MISR winds.\nP024 has better height retrieval statistics than P040. The latter is exclusively over mountains, and it is\nquite possible that the height-retrieval accuracy assessment has some dependence on the background\ntype.

It is a simple\nmatter to demonstrate observability of all states from simulated data under similar assumptions used\nto make Figure 8. Whether the W-component is interpreted as an updraft/downdraft, growth/collapse\nof a cloud, or is an artifact of matching between imagery of vertically extended objects looking down\non them and obliquely is a separate question that deserves careful attention in further research. Table 6\npresents several simulation cases, each a variation on that of Figure 8. Case 1a is our baseline (exactly\nFigure 8) with two-component AMV retrievals and truth winds that are strictly horizontal. Case 1b\nadds a 2 m/s W-component to all truth winds to show that, if unmodeled, both the retrieved height\nand UV-components become biased. This bias is effectively removed when a W-component is retrieved\n(Case 1c) but uncertainties grow in the other retrieved states, particularly in the AMVs. This shows\nfrom a strictly theoretical perspective that solving for three-component AMVs is not bene\xef\xac\x81cial when\nthe W-components are truly nearly zero in nature, which is thought to be the majority of the time\nin nature. On the other hand, situations where the W-component is large (~2 m/s [56]) may be of\nmeteorological signi\xef\xac\x81cance and therefore should not be ignored. Adding additional MISR cameras\nadds to the observability of the W-component as shown in Cases 2, at least with the simplistic error\nmodel used in our simulation, and uncertainties in all AMV components approach baseline values\nwhen using the ABC and ABCD cameras.

A third point is that the optical depth associated with the contrast\nfor the pattern (estimated ~0.3 [57]) should be typically larger than that of the \xef\xac\x81rst LiDAR return;\ntherefore, LiDAR assignments of cloud heights should be biased high with respect to stereo methods,\nwhich can be seen in Figure 2.\n4. Discussions\nWe now consider the meaning of a wind height assignment and implications for future work,\nincluding low-cost systems for 3D-Wind retrievals that take advantage of the techniques just described.\n4.1. Stereo Height vs. IR Height\nStereo height is perhaps the most consistent and accurate vertical registration of a cloud pattern\nsince both stereo height and AMV can use the same pattern matcher to determine the feature\xe2\x80\x99s\ndisparities in spatially and temporally separated images. A caveat would be that an AMV can\nbe determined from two nadir images, whereas stereo height needs the nadir and slant views.\nCloud features are assumed to be similar from different viewing angles, which should be valid\nfor the majority of cloudy scenes. However, this assumption can break down sometimes in multi-layer\ncloud situations where the upper level cloud is transparent at the nadir view but opaque at the\nslant view.\nTo better understand the connection between the stereo height and the IR height derived from\nbrightness temperature, we carry out a set of radiative transfer calculations from simulated cloud\n\xef\xac\x81elds. We use the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) community radiative transfer\nmodel (CRTM) to compute both cloudy and clear-sky radiances at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) at the\n11 \xc2\xb5m band. CRTM includes scattering calculations for cloud, aerosol, gas molecular and the surface\nas speci\xef\xac\x81ed, and has been the key backbone in DA systems [58].\nIn the simulation we use a cloudy atmosphere generated by a 3D cloud-resolving model (CRM)\nin a 512 \xc3\x97 512 km region over the Eastern Paci\xef\xac\x81c that includes cloud ice, liquid, snow, rain, graupel,\nand meteorological variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, and humidity). The simulated atmosphere\nhas 1 km resolution with a realistic synoptic forcing from MERRA-2 reanalysis data [59]. The CRTM\nwas used to produce the 11 \xc2\xb5m radiances at the TOA for two viewing angles, 0\xe2\x97\xa6 and 45\xe2\x97\xa6 , as shown in\nFigure 18. The simulated 3-D cloud variables are \xef\xac\x81rst interpolated to a vertical grid with 250 m spacing,\nto match the horizontal resolution (1 km) in a 1:4 ratio. For the 45\xe2\x97\xa6 slant path calculation, we used\nthe staggered shift method that was employed before in Gong et al. [60] and V\xc3\xa1rnai and Davies [61],\nto select the cloud pro\xef\xac\x81le indices and pick every 4th vertical index for each horizontal index shift.\nThese staggered shift pro\xef\xac\x81les, starting from the model top (~25 km) to the surface, are input to CRTM\nto create the cloud images at 45\xe2\x97\xa6 view. The 45\xe2\x97\xa6 cloud image is further used for pattern matching with\nthe nadir-view image simulated using a vertical pro\xef\xac\x81le at every 4th vertical index. All the simulated\nimages have effective vertical and horizontal resolutions of 1 km. CRTM\xe2\x80\x99s K-matrix mode outputs the\nJacobians of the simulated radiances with respect to atmospheric and cloud variable.\nA 20 \xc3\x97 20-km domain is used for stereo pattern matching, and the retrieved stereo height is\ncompared with cloud heights from various de\xef\xac\x81nitions. Figure 19 compares the stereo height with three\ngeometric CTHs: domain average, domain maximum, and domain top-20% average. The domain-mean\nCTHs are consistently lower than the stereo heights except for a few high clouds, while domain-max\nand domain-top-20% average are generally higher except for some low clouds.

Future Global AMVs with CubeSat Constellations\nThe signi\xef\xac\x81cantly improved AMV and height retrievals from MISR+GOES demonstrate the\npower of multi-platform wind observations for atmospheric research and future operational weather\nmonitoring. Multi-platform stereo techniques can be applied across a constellation of operational GEO\nsatellites and in LEO-GEO combinations. Figure 21 presents a concept for a constellation of multi-angle\nimaging systems hosted on CubeSats that are now available at a relatively low cost. This concept is\nsimilar to some previous proposals for similar observing systems [62\xe2\x80\x9365]. Coupling LEO CubeSat\nobservations with operational GEO satellites (i.e., GOES, Himawari, and Meteosat) has the bene\xef\xac\x81t of\nboth providing an additional vantage point and serving as a standard reference for geo-registration\nthat can be used to calibrate registration biases and enable accurate 3D retrievals. High performance\nINR is not necessarily required of all components of the LEO-GEO combination since, as we have\nshown, systematic errors can be calibrated and compensated using the bundle-adjustment technique.\nNeither is synchronization of observations required between platforms as there is none between MISR\nand GOES. These observations point to the feasibility of deploying compact imaging systems on\nlow-cost CubeSats. High-precision absolute pointing is not required as long as errors remain correlated\nover the collection time.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n27 of 37\n\nFigure 21.

Compact Midwave Imaging System (CMIS)\nThe great potential for CubeSat cloud imaging provides a strong motivation for developing the\nCompact Midwave Imaging System (CMIS). CMIS is an ongoing project funded by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Earth\nScience Technology Of\xef\xac\x81ce to advance the technical readiness level of a low size, weight, power and\ncost (SWaP-C) imager for a LEO mission to retrieve 3D-Wind AMVs and heights.\nThe CMIS instrument consists of three bands at 2.25, 3.75, and 4.05 \xc2\xb5m for sensing clouds,\naerosols, and atmospheric particulates. The 3.75-\xc2\xb5m channel provides aft, nadir, and fore views\nfor stereo sensing. CMIS employs push broom imaging with a butcher block stripe \xef\xac\x81lter installed\nimmediately above the Type-2 Superlattice focal plane array (FPA) [66]. This type of detector operates at\nrelatively high temperatures (150 K), while permitting CMIS to approach the sensitivity and radiometric\nperformance of exquisite instruments such as ABI, MODIS and VIIRS. The system avoids the use\nof scanning mechanisms and requires only modest cooling to maintain the detector temperature\nat 150 K, which keeps the instrument volume small and power draw low. The SWaP-C of CMIS\nis compatible with CubeSats and therefore offers the potential of a CubeSat constellation in LEO\nto provide high-quality, AMVs using the aforementioned techniques to provide rapidly revisited,\nglobal-scale observations. Such a constellation could provide good coverage at the poles provided that\nat least a few of the satellites are in highly inclined orbits.\nThe wavelength bands chosen for CMIS in the shortwave/mid-wave infrared (SWIR/MWIR)\nprovide several distinct advantages.

MISR imagery from its fore, aft and nadir cameras are used along with GOES Full\nDisk (FD), CONUS, or Mesoscale (MESO) imagery from T0 \xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x88\x86T, T0 , and T0 + \xe2\x88\x86T, where T0 is a GOES\nproduct time closest to the time of the selected MISR nadir-camera data block and \xe2\x88\x86T is the GOES\nproduct refresh period. The MISR dataset used has already been recti\xef\xac\x81ed to the WGS84 ellipsoid and\nmapped into a Space Oblique Mercator (SOM) projection. The GOES dataset has also already been\nrecti\xef\xac\x81ed to the GOES \xef\xac\x81xed-grid which is similarly a projection over the WGS84 ellipsoid. Using the\nMISR An camera as a common reference, we measure disparities in the MISR fore and aft cameras and\nthe triplet of GOES images. Each disparity locates an object O , represented by a template centered at a\ntie point in the MISR An camera image, in any of the \xef\xac\x81ve (or more) other images. From the disparities,\nwe calculate the geographic coordinates for each object O as it would appear if it were to rest on\nthe ellipsoid. The lack of simultaneity between images means the motion of O must be explicitly\nformulated in the model, which is obviously necessary for wind vector estimation but is confounding\nfor parallax height assignments.\nA.1.

Bundle Adjustment.\nSystematic errors may be seen in the disparity measurements because of small geo-registration\nerrors. The important consideration is the relative error. If this is nearly constant and uniform for\na short time across the MISR blocks, then the relative bias can be built into the retrieval process by\nintroducing states to model it that will be estimated simultaneously with the 3D-wind retrieval states\nXm at each individual site m. This approach is called a bundle adjustment [69]. Suppose that six\ndisparity measurements are made from the MISR An camera to the Aa, An (self), Af, and three GOES\nmultitemporal images corresponding to indices n = 1, . . . , 6. We use all but the self (n = 2) case in the\n3D-wind retrieval.
