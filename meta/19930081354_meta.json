By the use of suitable approximations, the differential equation of motion of the rotor during this maneuver is reduced to a form that can be solved. Only the vertical jump was studied; the effect of a forward motion during the jump is discussed briefly. The results of model tests of the jump take-off have been incorporated in the paper and used to establish the relative accuracy of the results predicted from the analysis. Good agreement between calculation and experiment was obtained by making justifiable allowances.", "title": "Analysis and Model Tests of Autogiro Jump Take-off", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930081354, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wheatley, John B"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "2506bd04ecee4c60a5ffd58d5a1454ba"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930081354, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bioletti, Carlton"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "40d4b038d55f4db283994e3ae351f2f3"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-06-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930081354, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930081354, "id": "d3d5ddedfa8b44bb82a98cd7b76651c2", "publicationDate": "1936-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930081354.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930081354/downloads/19930081354.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930081354/downloads/19930081354.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930081354/downloads/19930081354.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
