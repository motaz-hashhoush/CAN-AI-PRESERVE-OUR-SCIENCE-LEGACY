The Glasair III, is an advanced technology homebuilt, constructed of a fiberglass and graphite fiber composite material, and equipped with digital instruments. Both technologies make the airplane more susceptible to lightning effects. When Glasair manufacturer, Stoddard-Hamilton, decided that lightning protection would enable more extensive instrument flight and make the plane more marketable, they proposed a joint development program to NASA Langley Research Center (LAR). Under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract, Langley contractors designed and tested a lightning protection system, and the Glasair III-LP became the first kit-built composite aircraft to be lightning tested and protection-verified under FAA guidelines for general aviation aircraft.", "title": "Lightning Protection", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080124, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080124, "isbn": "0-16-045368-2", "id": "c3f45da0787b44c78e4677c487a99e7a", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1994", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080124.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080124/downloads/20020080124.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080124/downloads/20020080124.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080124/downloads/20020080124.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
