Such ices are thought to make up at least half, by mass, of all condensed material in the outer solar system. The surfaces and interiors of these icy satellites have undergone considerable geologic evolution, and in some cases may still be active today. So that these processes can be understood, certain critical data on the behavior of water and other ices at low (ca. 100 K) temperatures and high (ca. 10 kbar) pressures are needed. Given such data, various techniques for modeling planetary interiors can be tested to see which models best describe the conditions observed on these bodies; such models may then be used to study larger, terrestrial planets.", "title": "Ice-rich moons and the physical properties of ice", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T01:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840034921, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Consolmagno, G.
