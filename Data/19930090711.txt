b'AIRCRAFT CIRCTJLARS\nATIONAL ADVISORY OOMflTTEE FOR AZRONAUTICS\n\nNo. 96\n\nTHE "POTEZ 33t\n\nMILITARY AIRPLANE (FRENcH)\n\nWashington\nJun 1929\n\nNATIONAL ADVISORY COITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS.\nAIRCRAFT CIRCULAR NO. 96.\nTHE "POTEZ 33" MILITARY AIRPLANE (FRENCH).*\nThe t potez 33!t has a very complete military equipment so\nthat it caxi be used. in peace times as a school airplane for\ntraining pilots and observers, and in warfare as a messenger\nairplane, due to its maneuverability and low landing speed,\nwhich enable it to land. on improvised fields. Its characteristics are the same. as those of the commercial 32 type, the\nfirst French airplane of medium power actually in use on\nFrench and foreign air lines (Figs. 1 and 4).\nThe two enclosed pilot seats with dual control are placed\nabreast in the front end of the fuselage, thus affording perfect visibility.\nAll the control instruments (revolution counter, o-il thermometer, gasoline gauge, air-speed indicator, altimeter,., turn\nindicator, etc.) are convenienily arranged on the instrument\nboard in front of the pilot. A compass and a drift indicator,\nmounted in the axis of the airplane can be observed at .thesame\ntime by the pilot and by the navigator. Another drift indicator in the cabin serves for the instruction of the student observers.\nThis airplane has a complete electric outfit for night\nflying.\n*From Bulletin Technique des Avions H. Potez, January, i929.\n\n\t\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 96\n\n2\n\nAn O.P.L. camera gun, operated by the pilot, is installed\nabove the instrument board over the axis of the airplane (Figs.\n2, 3 and 5). A T.0.7 balanced Scarff mount in the upper rear\npart of the cabin is fitted for twin machine guns, which have\na very small dead angle due to the elevated position of the wing\n(Fig. 6).. The bombing equipment consists of a vertical bomb\nrack for twelve 10-kilogram (22-pound) bombs inside the cabin\nand a S.T.I.A. bomb sight.\nA hatch in the cabin floor is used for taking vertical\nphotographs, while an orifice in the left wall of the cabin\nserves for oblique views. Specialsupports enable the use of\nall types of army camera.\nA radio receiving set is installed in the upper front\npart of the cabin and a sending set in the lower part. Two keys\nenable the sending of messages, either from the cabin or from\nthe navigator\'s seat (Fig. ?). There is a box of eight signal\nrockets which can be easily dumped and a rocket discharging\ntube which can also be dumped.\nThe size (5.5 m 3 = 194 cu.ft.) of the cabiit makes it posible to accomplish all tasks under conditions of comfort quite\nsuperior to those found on airplanes now in service. The pilots are protected from the inclemencies of the weather. The\nseats for the crew are folding. There is a table for writing\nreports during flight. Long flights can therefore be made\nwithout fatiguing the crew. The very complete equipment, more-\n\n/\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 96 \t\n\n3\n\nover, is not limitative, the available space rendering it capable of being mOdified at the will of the users."\nThe "Potez 3311 can be used\n1.\n\nFor the advanced training of pilots.-. The seats for\n\nthe pilots have dual controls and are placed abreast, thus enabling the student pilot to observe the gestures of the instructor and to hear the advice given by him.\n2.\n\nFor teaching observers.- There are places for two stu-\n\ndent observers and. their instructor in the cabin, an arrangement which has never before been realized on an airplane of medium power. The large windows furnish excellent visibility.\nThe itoise of the engine is greatly deadened by the wooden walls\nof the cabin, so that the instructor can readily be heard by\nthe students during flight. Communication between the cabin\'\nand the pilot room is easily made through a door, rendering it\npossible to train pilots and observers simultaneously and thus\neducate homogeneous crews.\n3.\n\nAs a messenger airplane.- The ttPotez 33t constitutes\n\na fine type of swift and maneuverable messenger plane, able,\nin case of war, to perform all kinds of special missions, such\nas communications between the staffs, swift and comfortable\ntransportatiom of important officials, etc.\n\nN.AC.AS Aircraft Circular No. 96\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n4. As an ambulance airplane.- Special fittings in the\ncabin enable the "potez 331t to be converted quickly into a\nlight ambulance plane capable of carrying two wounded persons\nreclining, one wounded person sitting, and an attendant. Its\nlow landing speed enables it to land on small fields near the\nfighting line.\nCharacteristics and performances\n14.50\n\nm\n\n(47.57 ft.)\n\nLength\n\n9.82\n\n"\n\n(32.22\n\nHeight\n\n3.28\n\n"\n\n(10.76\n\nTrack gauge\n\n2.37\n\nU\n\nSpan\n\n36\n\nArea of aileron\nvertical empennage\n\nU\t\nII\t\n\nft\t\n\nhorizontal\t\n\nII\n\nFull load\nWing loading\nPower\t\n\n"\n\n7.78\n\n)\n\n"\t )\nt\'\n\n(67.5 sq.ft.)\n\nin2\n\n4\n\nWing area\n\n(\t\n\nt\t\n\nm2\n\n(43,06 sq.ft.)\n\n1.855 m 2\n\n(19.97\n\n"\t\n\n)\n\n4.637\n\n(49.91\n\n"\t\n\n)\n\n1600\n44.4\n6.4\n\nMaximum horizontal speed\nnear ground\n\n188\n\nMinimum, horizontal speed\nnear ground\n\nn\ni2\n\n(3527.4\n\nkg\n\nlb.)\n\nkg/m e\n\n(\t 9.09 lb./sq,ft.)\n\nkg/\n\n(13.92 lb./HP.)\n\nkm/h\n\n(116.82 mi./hr.)\n\n80\n\n"\n\nClimbing time t-, 1000 in ( 3,280.83.ft.)\n"\t "\t 4000\t \'\t (13,123.00 ." )\n5500 "\t (18,045.00 I\'\t )\nCeiling,\t\nTranslation by Dwight M.
