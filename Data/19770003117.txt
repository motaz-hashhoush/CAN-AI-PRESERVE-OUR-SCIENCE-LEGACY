The cngine/airplane\nstudies described here were, therefore, intended to identify pronlising VCE concepts, simplify their designs and identify the\npotential benefits in terms of aircraft performance. This\nincludes range, noise, emissions, and the time and effort it may\nrequire to ensure technical readiness of sufficient depth to\nsatisfy reasonable economic, performance, and environmental\nconstraints.\t A brier overview of closely-related, on-going technology programs in aeousticS and exhaust enliSSions is also\npresented.\t it is shown that realistic technology adva r xlnents\n,\nill critical areas combined with well matched, aircraft and\nselected VCE concepts call\n\t to significantly improved\neconomic and environmental performance relative to firstgeneration SST predictions:\n\n-:\ne\n\n#t\n5\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n{\n\n:I\nl-\n\nIntroduction\nSince the early I970\'s, NASA With support froin induStry\ncontractors has been conducting StUdics of advtnlced variable <\nCycle engines (VCI \'S) and supersonic aircraft as part of the\nSupersonic Cruise Aircraft Research (SCAR)\' program, This\npaper reviews the evolution andcurrent Status o1` recent engine)\naircraft Study work; conducted jointly by Pratt & Whitney and\nBoeing under NASA contracts, and describes how the engine\nconcepts have beeninflllenCCCI b y airplane t l;quircnlcnts.\nFuture civil or military supersonic cruising aircraft must\nsimultaneously meet severe, essentially contradictory perform\xe2\x80\xa2\nance, economic and environmental requirements. These, in turll,\ncreate difficulties for the propulsion system.\t In modern multimission fighters, for example, the engine size and Cycle that are\n"right" for SllperS011iC combat are very likely to be "wrong" for\nextended 5Ubsonic cruising, and. vice-versa. The problem is compounded in civil supersonic airplanes by the need to -observe\'\nenvironmental criteria,\t It is well-relnenlbered that the noiseSST\nversus-engine size dil.nulla contributed heavily to the 1970\nprogram cancellation,\nSTAR Cat. 07\n\n,\nL\xe2\x80\x94k-\n\nHow shall we resolve these con flirts? When we examine the\nengines available today there are a suprisingly small number when\nwe consider U.S. supersonic combat capabilities and the recent \t\nadvent of foreign SST aircraft, i.e., TU-144 and Concorde. The\nJ58, altllougll capable of sustaining cruise at Mach 3 or above, is\na relatively old design, and is not considered suitable when all of\n\t generation civil aircraft are taken\nthe constraints placed oil\ninto account. Modern U.S. military engines were essentially\ndesigned for sustained subsonic cruise efficiency, with only a\nhigh Mach tuunber clash capability; their performance and service\nlife characteristics for supersoni-cruise aircraft would be tlnsatisfactory.\t Both the British and the RUSsians-at least have current \t\ndevelopmental experience to build upon. The R. R. Olympus593, for example, could be significantly upgraded by the steps\ndescribed in Reference 1.\t In its present form; however, it is subject to many of the same objections that destroyed the U. S. SST\nprogram in 1970. It is apparent that we cannot turn to contemporary western engines as powerplants for advanced supersonic\ncruising aircraft. We evidently need an entirely new class of\nengines to simultaneously inert the anticipated, conflicting needs.\n\'faking these factors into account, the NASA Supersonic\nCruise Aircraft Research (SCAR) program was instituted in the\nearly 1970\'s.\t In contrast to the earlier SST project, the SCAR\nwork is not aimed toward a production airplane, but rather, it is\nintended to establish a data base of advanced technology to be\navailable for the design of future supersonic cruise aircraft if and\nwhen the nation determines it is desirable to build them. The\nprogram\'s elements are relevant in varving degrees to both potential civil and military applications and apply both to the airplane\nStructure and aerodynamics and to the propulsion system; but\nonly the civil-propulsion related aspects will be discussed here,\nSCAR is a comparatively small program, but it was designed\nto cause innovation and it may grow larger,\t Its leading feature\nin the propulsion area has been a series of contracted engine\nstudies by General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, with a, major\nSubcontract between Pratt & Whitney and Boeing. In this paper\nwe will review only the joint Boeing and Pratt & . Whitney activities as .ill example of the total engine study effort. \t In so doing\nwe will trace the evolution of one group of VCE concepts from\nearly ideas (Reference 2) to two well-defined and apparentlyattractive Pratt .&. Whitney engines. (A parallel discussion of\nVCE eVO\nILlt1011 at General Electric is being presented in a com, panion . paper, Reference: 3).

These requirements have become\nincreasingly emphasized in view of increasing fuel price and the\nimposition of severe noise and emission requirements.

The technology needs of these engines are reviewed and a brief discussion.\nof related on-going programs and potential future options is also\npresented.\n\nREQUIRED RANGE\n\nLessons Learned in the SST Program\n2000\n\nIn 1970, the American SST had been penalized by propulsion\nrelated environmental and technical/economic difficulties as\nsuggested in Figure 1. The environmental problems centered\naround noise and emissions, both of which needed to be technically examined in great depth. The takeoff noise problem\ncould be only partially alleviated at the time by using a dry turbojet engine (larger than necessary for best performance)\nthrottled back for takeoff. The resulting effect was increased\npropulsion pod weight, associated increased drag, and aggravated\nsubsonic fuel consumption due to a larger throttle-back at subsonic Cruise. Other technical and economic difficulties were\nincreased by the constraint of noise which introduced poorer\nthan expected specific fuel consumption.\n\n1970\t\nTECHNOLOGY\nOET-HON\n\nNY\n\ni\nHON CHI\xe2\x80\xa2\nCHI ROME\n\nSUBSONIC\nLEG, NMI\nDET-ROME\n1000\nDET PARIS\nNY-ROME,\n\nn\n\nNY-LONDON\t\n3000\t\n\nNY-PARIS\t\nHON SYA\n4000\t\n\nSF-TOKYO\n50(\n\nTOTAL RANGE, NMI\n\nFigure 2. Performance of 2707-300 Relative to Requirement\nWhat have we learned from this experience? The one unmistakable lesson is that any future U. S. civil supersonic airplane\nwill be required to meet stringent and essentially contradictory\nperformance and environmental goals, or else it will never "get\noff the ground," There may be similar difficulties with future\nmilitary airplanes also, and we suggested earlier that a new class\nof engines would be needed to deal effectively with these\nproblems.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS \t\n\nTECHNICAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NOISE\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 EXCESSIVE WEIGHT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HIGH FUEL CONSUMPTION\n\xe2\x80\xa2 INADEQUATE RANGE\n\no POLLUTION\t\n\n.\n\nThere are malty ways to build a VCE and some of the early.\nideas were described in Reference 2. For this discussion, however, a. VCE Is best defined by what It does rather than how it is\nbuilt. -Functionally, it is an engine which accommodates at least\ntwo distinct modes of operation: (1) a high airflow, low jetvelocity mode for low noise takeoff and/or efficient subsonic\ncruise; and (2) a turbojet-like, higher jet velocity, lower airflow\nmode for good supersonic cruise.\n\nFigure 1. The 1970 U.S. SST Program\nThe emission characteristics were not examined in great\ndepth at that time, but (as will be discussed later)they would\nHave been unacceptable by current standards.\n\na\nE\n\nt\n\niZ;;3\n\n0\n\nSubsonic fuel consumption became an important economic\nissue for several reasons. Because of sonic boom restrictions the\nSST was limited to over-water supersonic flight, yet many\ndesirable routes include subsonic legs. In addition, the SST was\nrequired to fly subsonically to an alternate airfield, when unex-pettedly diverted from its original destination by weather or an\nengine inflight shutdown. It was also required to fly subsonically\nfor one-half hour at the end of the "divert" to represent atypical\nwait in the holding pattern prior to landing (so as to not require\nspecial air traffic control handling). The resulting dry turbojet\npowered SST required 50,000 lb of fuel for these contingencies\nin addition to the normal reserve quantity of 6 percent of trip\nfuel. The poor subsonic performance of the turbojet caused a\ndegradation in total range when the SST was flown subsonically,\nas shown in Figure 2. Under these conditions, nonstop routes\nsuch as New York to Rome or any Pacific routes were not possible to achieve without oversizing the 1970 airplane to an unacceptable degree. It is clear from an economic standpoint that it\nwould be desirable to expand the performance of a second generation commercial transport to encompass more of the city \t\npairs and hence increase the operational options for the using \t\nairlines as shown by the dashed area in Figure 2, To obtain air-\t\ncraft range as depicted in the dashed area with a reasonably- \t\n-\t\n\nIn more technical terms, the motivation for this "turbofanconvertible-to-turbojet" definition may be understood by reference to Figure 3. There, weight and cruise SFC trends for conventional supersonic engines are presented in terms of bypass\nratio. Clearly, both weight and subsonic fuel economy favorer\nfairly high bypass ratio, about 1;5 (turbofan mode). Supersonic\ncruise on the other hand calls for a low bypass engine, 0.3 or\nbelow when fuel economy is considered, but this is tempered\nsomewhat by the adverse weight trend. With a conventional\nengine, a compromise bypass ratio (usually in the 0.5 to 1.5\nrange, depending on the subsonic/supersonic mission mix) must\nbe chosen, which is not really optimum for either requirement.\nThe rationale for a VCE, then, is its potential ability to give us a\nbetter compromise, In quantitative terms, Figure 4 illustrates\nthat a 35% subsonic SFC savings was not only highly desirable,\nbut also at least conceptually possible using a once-favored\nBoeing VCE approach. A significant supersonic SFC savings\nwas also forecast as a realistic goal.\nTherefore, according to our definition, a VCE is ail\nthat does the right things. The many attempts that have been\nmade to actually design one may be broadly classified into two\ngeneric approaches, One would rely upon valves or equivalent\n2\n\nI\n\n3\n\nF\n\n\t\n7\n\nsub-programs. The studies define the objectives and directions\nof research for the technology sub-programs; results from the\nlatter feed back into the engine studies and regenerate them. The\nengine studies have been conducted primarily by means of a con\ntinuing series of contracts to the Pratt & Whitney Company (Ref.\n4 and 5) and the General Electric Company (Ref. 6 and 7).\nwith a major sub-contract between P&W and Tile Boeing Coinpany (described in Ref. 5 and 8-10). Technology sub-programs\ninvolving these contractors as well as others have been launched\nin the areas of noise abatement (Ref. 11-14), pollution reduction (Ref. 15-17), inlet stability (Ref. 18), and-supporting component and material programs (e.g., Ref. 9). Reference 20 provides an overview of the technology programs and Ref. 21\nsurveys parallel; airplane-related studies and technology programs\nadministered by the NASA Langley Research Center.\n\nmeans to create two or more discrete flowpaths upon demand\nwithin the same engine structure. The alternative would rely\nprimarily upon component variability and spool speed variations\nto achieve similar results, The joint Pratt & Whitney/Boeing\nefforts included examples of both of these approaches; We will \t - !\ndiscuss in the next several sections how the actual VICE concepts\nhave evolved during the NASA SCAR program, driven in part by\nairplane requirements, in part by practical design simplification,\nand in part by the in fklence of major technology results.\n:..\n\n-\n\nE\nI\t1.0\n\n-\n\n^,f1FCN2\n\nENGINE STUDIES\nP&W CONTRACTS\nGE CONTRACTS\nP&W/BOEING SUBCONTRACT\n\n4\n\nO\nJy\n\n-\n\n-\t\n\n-\n\nTECHNOLOGY SUBPROGRAMS \t\nNOISE REDUCTION\nPOLLUTION REDUCTION\nINLETSTABILITY\t\nCOMPONENTS\n\n-\n\nFigure 5.\t\n\nCr\n\n-\n\nThe SCAR Propulsion Program\n\',\n\nzQ\nE.\n\nBecause of environmental concerns, results from the noise\nabatement and pollution reduction technology programs can\nhave an exceptionally large impact on the engine studies.

In view of the similarity between this\nand some of the early Pratt & Whitney concepts and the potential applicability of the novel Boeing valve design, the abovementioned P&W/Boeing subcontract work was instituted in\nearly 1974. Its objective was to combine the two companies\'\t\nrespective areas of expertise to define an engine concept that\nwould be more useful in the airplane.\n\nno .reasonable candidate engines were excluded from considers- \t\ntfon. Many engines were studied optimistically but in little\t\ndepth, References 4 and 6. Only those engines which were\t\nobviously unacceptable under the most optimistic assumptions - \t\nwere excluded from further consideration. The deliberate intent\t\nwas to establish whether any variable cycle engines could stand\t\nthe test of all the constraints in a closed loop engine/airplane\' \t\nstudy. After the least promising concepts had been screened\t\nout, a smaller number of "survivors" received a more refined\t\nanalysis in Phase 2 (Ref. 5 and 7). Phase 3 has just recently\nbeen completed and is as-yet unpublished. In this phase a\ngreater depth of analysis was accomplished including the start of\t\nengine preliminary design activities. Based on the results, we\nhave now identified the two engines which appear to be most\npromising within file scope of the Pratt & Whitney,Boeing\ng\t\nP\t\nP\t\nactivities addressed in this paper. In Phase 4 we are initiating\nairframe integration activities, continuing with preliminary \t\ndesign and developing a series of technology recommendations\nrelative to the favored engines. These provide the engine manufacturers with an opportunity to define, for NASA\'s consideration, what is needed in terms of future technology programs in \t\norder to bring these paper engines into being:\n\nf\n\n!\n\nf^.\n\nt\n1\n\n_\t\n\n-\n\n.......o\t\nfigure Z\t\n\nEvolution of Valved VCE\'s \t\n\nTask Xlll Baseline Airplane\n\nin the early phases of the joint Pratt & Whitney/Boeing\nefforts, many engine schemes were evaluated in terms of their \t\n"\'\n1\t\nperformance on a baseline Boeing\n-\'\nC\ttvj SST design (Figure 7). These \t\nwere centered around two fundamental and at the outset seem-/\nj\t\ningly different concepts. The first was a duct burning turbofan\nwith considerable component and nozzle variability.

One of the earliest and most obvious was simply to\n^:\t d+ \'^\t\ninsert the AIV between the fan and compressor of ail\nconventional 2-shaft machine. in the "turbojet" mode, the\nvalve is set in its straight-through position. The fan and conr^j Q pressor flow in series, resulting in a two-spool, high overall\nFi (^ pressure-ratio (OPR) turbojet.

Fan air supplied by the normal inlet is by\n\t bypass duct.\npassed around the compressor and into ail\nMeanwhile; additional air from an auxiliary inlet is drawn\nThrough a second set of channels in the valve, into the compressor, and hence, through the combustor and turbines.

For the same reason a variable (and probably\nmulti-stage) low-pressure turbine may be needed to provide high\nrelative work extraction in the turbofan mode, and lower extraction in the turbojet mode. From the airframe point of view it\nwas observed that the high-airflow mode for takeoff and subsonic\n4\n\n1\n\nI\n\ncruise led to a requirement for an efficient auxiliary inlet. This\nimplied a major design and development task and a significant\nadditional installed-weight penalty (above that required to\nenclose the engine\'s greater length and diameter).i The closed-off\nbypass duct also would entail a sizable base or boattail drag\npenalty during supersonic cruise.\n\n`\t\n\nSubsequent efforts were aimed at removing or minimizing\nsonic o,\xc2\xb0 these complications. Many alternatives involving front\nvalves, rear valves, front and rear valves, and improved valve con-\t cepts were evaluated iteratively by Pratt & Whitney and Boeing.\nTheir detailed descriptions may be found in Reference 5 and will\nnot be repeated here.\t Let it suffice to say that these intermediate\nconcepts, examples of which are illustrated in Figure 9, were\ngenerally quite complex. While at first appearing attractive, they\ngenerally gave disappointing performance when installed on the\nbaseline SST airplane.. _Inlet problems and unanticipated engine\nweight or performance penalties caused reduced aircraft performance relative to a conventional power plant.\n\n`\n\nI\n\n--_\n\nr I\t\n\n-\n\np\nL\ni\n\n(^\n\nT\t ".\n\nr\n\n-\t\n\n"_ `_\n\n-\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\n,.a\nw\nV\n\xe2\x96\xba\n\na\n^i g\n;,,4\nO\n\n\'r\nI/\n\nit was at this juncture in the studies that two major design\nand technology developments entered the analysis with a\ndecisive impact. These were the invention by Pratt & Whitney of\nthe unique "inverted thin tle schedule" (ITS), and the so-called\n"Co annuh!;r noise benefit"\' effect\nThe ITS technique allowed the engines to maintain a very\nsatisfactory inlet match over almost the entire subsonic to supersonic Flight regime. It also resulted in significant supersonic-SFC\nimprovements. In brief, the primary combustor exit temperature,\nand hence the core\'s power level, is scheduled to increase significantly as the airplane accelerates from takeoff to supersonic\ncruise. This combined with appropriate fan and nozzle geometry variations allows the core to speed up while the fan spool\nmaintains a nearly constant corrected airflow. Consequently\nthe core swallows a larger fraction of the fail\n\t i.e. the bypass\nratio is decreased. This in turn decreases the need for augmentation and significantly improves the supersonic SFC\'s\xe2\x80\x94to the\npoint that the goals of Figure 4 were finally met.\n\n.halved VCE Schemes\n\nTo summarize Figure 10, the early duct-burners and VCE\'s\nwere no better than competitive with the GE4, and some of them\nin fact were worse. The evolutionary process we have described\namounted to "fixing" each problem as it was identified.

If sized for supersonic cruise it\nwould starve the engine during its high airflow mode and negate\none Of its major advantages.\n\nj\n\ni\n\nThis technique is applicable both to the rear valve engine and\nalso to engines of more conventional appearance. In the case of\nthe duct-burner, the supersonic SFC improvement was dramatic\nand resulted in the two engines finally having very nearly the\nsame cruise performance. Combined with moderate increases in\ncycle temperatures (made possible by improved cooling techniques).

At its end-point, both the rear-valve VCE (RV VCE) \t\nand the duct-burner (by now termed the Variable Stream Con- \t\ntrol Engine or VSCE) showed significant improvements over the \t\nGE4 baseline. When sized for maximum range, these two engines\t\nprovide competitive performance levels in the Boeing airplane, \t\nessentially within the noise band of the estimating procedures \t\nused. This method of sizing however did not consider noise, and\t\nthe airplanes represented by the two end-points would not neces-\t\nsarily have met FAR 36 without the aid of some form of noise \t\nsuppression.\n\nj\t\n\n\'\t\n\nThe benefit illustrated in Figure 1 I was in the beginning\ndescribed in such terms as "black magic" or "something-fornothing." We believe however that the test programs, mentioned\nabove have been conducted in a sound and scientific manlier, \t\nNevertheless, several caveats must be mentioned. Most -finda-\t\nmental is that the results illustrated in Figure l I were taken at\nsmall scale and (lid not include forward4clocity effects. Testing\nplanned for the fairly near future willrernedy these gaps in our\nknowledge and we are optimistic about the outcome. But 10070\nconfidence is not justified until t1he tests are complete,\nAnother caution to be observed is that the benefit does not\t\napply equally or without penalty to all engines. As described in\t\nReferences I 1 through 14, the nozzle and engine must meet\nsome very definite conditions involving radius ratios, stream\nvelocities and flow areas. As will be seen later, it is in this area\nthat we finally differentiate between the VSCE and the RVVCE.\n\nTile necessary relief was provided by the SCAR noise reduc \t\ntion technology program. This research has led to the "Co-annu-\t\nlar Noise Benefit" effect which is considered to be a major \t\n"break-through," as illustrated in Figure 11. ht brief, small-scale \t\nstatic model test results indicate that: (a) if a two stream coaxial \t\nnozzle is so arranged that the high velocity stream is on the Outside and the low velocity stream is on the inside; and (b) if in \t\naddition the outer nozzle has a high annular radius ratio; then\nthejet noise is significantly lower than would be classically pre \t\ndieted for an equivalent pair of conventional conical nozzles \t\n(having the same individual airflows and velocities as the coaxial \t\nstreams). This effect was first noted by Pratt & Whitney and \t\nwas later confirmed by parallel, independent testing at General \t\nElectric. it is of the utmost significance for the present VCE \t\nconcepts since they inherently have a coaxial, high radius ratio \t\ntwo stream nozzle flow configuration. \t\nr\t\ng\t\n\no\t\n\nw\n\nj\n\nj\nj\n\n#\n\nappearance.

Two\nbands are shown, the upper one for conventional nozzles and\nthe lower one for co-annular nozzles. The 1970 turbojet operated at a relatively high jet velocity and created a noise signature\n12 to 15 dB above the FAR`36 requirement. But when a\nco-annular nozzle is used, the noise signature is immediately\ndecreased by 8 to 10 dB, If this is combined with a variable\n1264 cycle engine which is capable of taking-off at reduced jet \t\nvelocities (without otherwise penalizing the airplane), a noise \t\n0 signature well below FAR 36 can be anticipated. The combingtion of the two concepts, namely, the co-annular nozzle and the\ntwo-stream VCE, results in perhaps a 10 to 12 dB lower noise \t\nthan that Of a turbojet with a conventional nozzle\'. We believe \t\nthat this will have a decisive impact on the environmental \t\nacceptability of any future SST, \t\n\n\'^\nI\n\na\n\n1\n\nfigure i3. Real Valve Variable Cycle Engine\n\nUnder subsonic cruise conditions the duct burner is not lit.\nThe engine then is precisely a conventional separate flow medium\nbypass turbofan engine (bypass 1,5) and it provides relatively\ngood subsonic cruise performance.\n\n6\n\nFor takeoff, acceleration and supersonic cruise, however,\nadditional thrust is required. This is obtained by lighting the\nduct burner. During supersonic cruise operation the corel is\nspeeded up by increasing the temperature in the main combustor_\nj\t\nand by manipulating the component variaLle geometry features.\nThereby, the bypass ratio is decreased and the need for aUgmen\nj\ttation is decreased, resulting in specific fuel consumption\napproaching that of a well designed turbojet engine. For takeoff,\nthe additional noise implied by the duct-burner being lit is offset\nby the co-annular benefit. As will be seen, this permits us to\nsize the engine for optimum supersonic cruise while still meeting\nj\t\nFAR 36 takeoff noise requirements.\n-\t The second VCE is the Pratt & Whitney rear-valve engine\n(RVVCE) depicted in Figure 13. it is an attractive example of\nthe "changing-flow-path" VCE approach, although probably \'!not\nthe end-point of that approach. The engine\'s flowpath is similar\nto the VSCE\'s with ttte addition of a valve and an additional\nturbine stage downstream of the normal LPT. The valve is a\nPratt and Whitney refinement of the inverting valve which uses\nflaps rather than a rotating, assembly to either infix or cross-over\nf\t\nthe two flow streams.\t Depending on the valve\'s position, either\nof two distinct flowpaths may be selected.\n-\'\n\nSince the aft turbine then extracts relatively little power, the\nengine behaves as if it were a conventional mixed flow turbofan\nwith a bypass of about 2.5.\nAirplane Performance Evaluation\nTh4 two engine concepts that evolved from the study had, in\nthe limit, essentially equal performance and met the goals we\nestablished earlier. By the end of the study, both engines had\nbeen integrated into efficiently-shaped low drag pods. A comparisonof their installed thrust/SFC characteristics is shown in\nFigure 14. The supersonic cruise SFC\'s of 1.35 to 1.4 are very\nclose to what can be attained by an optimum, turbojet of equal\ntechnology and a substantial improvement over the CE4 (recall\nFigure 4).

The major\nhope for the future, therefore, is in the area of advanced combustor technology. Pre-mix and catalytic combustors (e.g.\nReference 17) have demonstrated, values as low as 1 gin./kg. in\nsmall scale, idealized laboratory experiments. But it is clear that\n_.\na large, lengthy ^\t\n^,\t\nb\t y and\t probably expensive program, including both\nfundamental research work-and applied development, will be\nrequired to translate these promising concepts into reality.\nAssuming that the necessary programs will be forthcoming, we\nanticipate that values on the order of 25% or the conventionalcombustor levels may eventually be attainable in practical\nengines. It should be recognized, however, that this involves our\nentering a new and relatively unknown area of technology, and\nthis has yet to be done in a serious way. The above estimates are\ntherefore uncertain, as are the projected requirements; either or\nboth may change significantly in the future.\n\nPREMIX CATALYTIC\nCOMBUSTOR ETC\n\n-1100\t\n1150\t\n1050\t\nCOMBUSTOR INLET AIR TEMPERATURE (\xc2\xb0F,\n\n1200\n\nClearly required are Quiet coannular nozzles, underlined on\nthe figure because they are not only critically needed but are\nunique to this class of engines and not likely to be developed\nunder other programs.

The, improvement sho vn is\nattributable both to general technology advances in the airg\'\t\n8y\np\t\ny-p\nplane and engines, coupled with theemergence_of viable VCE\nconcepts. Clearly, a\' major improvement in the airplane\'s;ability\nto serve attractive market areas has been identified on paper,\n\nI\n\n\'\n\n7.

But we believe that as the testbed programs are vigorously\npursued to their successful conclusions, the logical next steps will\nbe forthcoming.
