b'The present compact windscreen is\nbased on an entirely different principle:\nthat infrasound at sufficiently large wavelength can penetrate any barrier of practical thickness. Thus, a windscreen having\nsolid, non-porous walls can block convected pressure fluctuations from the\nwind while transmitting infrasonic\nacoustic waves. The transmission coefficient depends strongly upon the ratio between the acoustic impedance of the\nwindscreen and that of air. Several materials have been found to have impedance\nratios that render them suitable for use in\nconstructing walls that have practical\nthicknesses and are capable of high transmission of infrasound. These materials\n(with their impedance ratios in parentheses) are polyurethane foam (222), spaceshuttle tile material (332), balsa (323),\ncedar (3,151), and pine (4,713).\nA small wind tunnel was built to test the\nacoustical properties of a variety of windscreen materials. A fan generated wind at\nspeeds up to 21 mph (9.4 m/s) across an\ninfrasonic microphone. Tests were conducted with and without the windscreen;\nthe difference in the noises detected in\n\nthe presence and absence of the windscreen was used as a measure of the attenuation of wind noise by the windscreen.\nThe windscreen that performed best\nin the wind-tunnel tests was a cylinder\nmade of polyurethane foam of a type\nknown in the industry as \xe2\x80\x9ceightpounder,\xe2\x80\x9d having an inside diameter of\n3 in. (7.62 cm), a wall thickness of 0.5 in.\n(1.27 cm), and a length of 12 in. (30.48\ncm). The attenuation of wind-generated\nnoise was quantified as the ratio between\nthe wind noises measured without and\nwith this windscreen. The results, plotted in the upper part of Figure 1, show\nthat this windscreen attenuated wind\nnoise by amounts ranging from 12 to 20\ndB at frequencies ranging from 0.7 to 20\nHz. The large spikes in the spectrum\nrepresent aeolian tones generated by\nthe wind passing over the windscreen,\nbut these lie above the infrasonic range.\nFor measurements of the infrasoundtransmission coefficient of this windscreen, a subwoofer was placed at an end\nof the wind tunnel and used to generate\na tone that was swept over the frequency\nband from 10 to 200 Hz. In this case, the\n\nratio between detected sounds, with and\nwithout the windscreen, was taken as a\nmeasure of the transmission through the\nwindscreen. The results for the portion\nof the spectrum from 10 to 100 Hz, plotted in the lower part of Figure 1, show\nthat this windscreen had a large transmission coefficient at frequencies below\n25 Hz, even exhibiting a gain as high as\n8 dB at 10 Hz, but then attenuated\nsound at higher frequencies. Finally, a\nsoak test revealed that the water absorbed by the polyurethane windscreen\nmaterial amounted to only 2.1 percent\nby weight.\nFigure 2 shows a windscreen installed\nover a microphone mounted on a pole\nin the field. The windscreen has proved\nrobust in weather conditions of all seasons and it survived Hurricane Isabel\nwith wind gusts up to 67 mph (30 m/s).\nThis work was done by Allan J. Zuckerwar,\nQamar A.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA broadband external-cavity diode\nlaser (ECDL) has been invented for use\nin spectroscopic surveys preparatory to\noptical detection of gases. Heretofore,\ncommercially available ECDLs have\nbeen designed, in conjunction with sophisticated tuning assemblies, for narrow-band (and, typically, single-frequency) operation, as needed for high\nsensitivity and high spectral resolution\nin some gas-detection applications. However, for preparatory spectroscopic surveys, high sensitivity and narrow-band\noperation are not needed; in such cases,\nthe present broadband ECDL offers a\nsimpler, less-expensive, more-compact\nalternative to a commercial narrowband\nECDL.\nTo be precise, the output of the tunable, broadband ECDL consists of many\nnarrow spectral peaks spaced at narrow\nwavelength intervals that, taken together, span a broad wavelength band.\nThe broadband ECDL can, therefore, be\nlikened to a light-emitting diode except\nthat the spectrum incorporates the external-cavity mode structure. Unlike\n\n28\n\nlight-emitting diodes, the ECDL offers\nthe greater brightness, simpler fiber\ncoupling, and superior spatial propagation properties of a laser. For example,\nthe broadband ECDL is easily coupled\ninto multiple-pass optical-path-length-\n\nenhancement cells. A tunable filter \xe2\x80\x94\npreferably, a monochromator or a spectrometer \xe2\x80\x94 is used to select a portion of\nthe output spectrum.\nThe optical configuration of the\nbroadband ECDL (see figure) is based\nDiffraction\nGrating\n\nDiode Laser\nCollection Optic\n\nOutput\nFeedback\nMirror\n\nThe Feedback Mirror Is Made Curved (in contradistinction to flat) to make it select a range of wavelengths (in contradistinction to a single wavelength).\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, September 2005\n\non, but differs from, a standard configuration known in the art as that of the\nLittman-Metcalf\ndesign.\nWhereas\nheretofore, a flat feedback mirror would\nbe used to select a single laser output\nwavelength, in the present case, a curved\nfeedback mirror is used to select multiple wavelengths. Preferably, the feedback mirror is cylindrical or spherical\nand is positioned with its center of curvature at the point of diffraction (the intersection of the laser beam with the diffraction grating).\nIn this configuration, each wavelength component diffracted from the\n\ngrating is reflected from the mirror\nback to the point of diffraction. Thus,\nmany wavelength components are simultaneously oscillating in the external\ncavity. The wavelength range is determined by the range of angles intercepted by the mirror; hence, the wavelength range can be adjusted by moving\nthe mirror to a different position on the\ndiffraction circle. The zeroth-order output of the diffraction grating is used as\nthe laser output.\nThe length of the external cavity (including the mirror radius) determines\nthe longitudinal mode spacing. It is\n\npreferable to make this spacing smaller\nthan the wavelength resolution of tunable filter, so that for the purpose of filtering, the ECDL spectrum can be regarded as continuous.\nThis work was done by Jeffrey S. Pilgrim of\nSouthwest Sciences, Inc. for Glenn Research\nCenter.

Whereas the energy-conversion efficiencies of currently available\nsolar cells are typically less than 30 percent, it has been estimated that the energy-conversion efficiencies of the proposed cells could be about 50 percent or\npossibly even greater.\nThe primary source of inefficiency of\na currently available solar cell is the mismatch between the narrow wavelength\nband associated with the semiconductor\nenergy gap (the bandgap) and the\nbroad wavelength band of solar radiation. This mismatch results in loss of\npower from both (1) long-wavelength\nphotons, defined here as photons that\ndo not have enough energy to excite\nelectron-hole pairs across the bandgap,\nand (2) short-wavelength photons, defined here as photons that excite electron-hole pairs with energies much\nabove the bandgap. It follows that a\nlarge increase in efficiency could be obtained if a large portion of the incident\nsolar energy could be funneled into a\nnarrow wavelength band corresponding\nto the bandgap. In the proposed approach, such funneling would be effected by use of PBG materials as intermediaries between the Sun and\nphotovoltaic cells.\nThe approach involves a thermophotovoltaic principle in addition to the use\nof PBG materials. The basic idea is to tailor the wavelength- and direction-dependent emissivity of one or more PBG\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, September 2005\n\nmaterial(s) such that as much as possible\nof the wavelength-mismatched portion\nof the incident broad-band solar power\nwould be absorbed \xe2\x80\x94 the absorbed\npower would cause heating, and the resulting thermal radiation would be funneled into a narrow band corresponding\nto the bandgap of the semiconductor\nAbsorber\n\nmaterial of a solar cell. Recent experiments unrelated to the development of\nsolar cells have shown that as much as\nhalf of the thermal power could be thus\nre-routed into the bandgap.\nThe figure depicts two of many conceivable configurations for implementing the proposal. In one configuration,\n\nEmitter\n\nSolar Cell\n\nMirror\n\nSunlight\n\nPBG Filter\nPBG Absorber/Emitter/Filter\n\nSolar Cell\n\nPBG Mirror\n\nSunlight\n\nPBG Materials Could Be Utilized in these and other configurations to increase the energy-conversion\nefficiencies of solar cells.\n\n29\n\n'
