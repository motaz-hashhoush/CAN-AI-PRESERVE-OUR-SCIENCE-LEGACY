Attention is then given to radar signal absorption by the various atmospheric gases, rain drop size distribution and wind velocity determinations, and the characteristics of clouds, as well as the range of available estimation methods for backscattering, single- and dual-wavelength attenuation, and polarimetric and climatological characteristics.", "title": "Spaceborne weather radar", "stiType": "BOOK", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T07:43:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910039489, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Meneghini, Robert"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "aac4f9f313154b29aeaee9eab962153f"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910039489, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kozu, Toshiaki"}, "organization": {"name": "Communications Research Laboratory", "location": "Koganei, Japan"}}, "id": "ab7d41ad2314414089310da3bf38a3a8"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Book", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910039489, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910039489, "id": "f3b95a4680b24d1e917b2cc3b1b7978b", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
