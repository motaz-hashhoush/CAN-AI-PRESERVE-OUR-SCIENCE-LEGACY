These computational\nsimulations will be utilized to gain understanding of\nprocesses and materials behavior to accelerate process\ndevelopment and certification to more efficiently integrate new materials in existing NASA projects and to\nlead to the design of new materials for improved performance. This NASA effort looks to collaborate with\nefforts at other government agencies and universities\nworking under the national MGI.\nMGI plans to develop integrated computational/experimental/processing methodologies for accelerating discovery and insertion of materials to satisfy NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nunique mission demands.\nThe challenges include validated design tools that\nincorporate materials properties, processes, and design\nrequirements; and materials process control to rapidly\nmature emerging manufacturing methods and develop\ncertified manufacturing processes.\nThe approach includes physics-based modeling to\nguide material design (e.g., composition, grain size, and\ntexture); fiber layup; multiscale modeling to predict the\ninfluence of materials design on mechanical properties\nand durability; process modeling to determine optimal\nprocessing parameters to reliably produce as-designed\nmaterial nano-/micro-structures and enable advanced\nmanufacturing methods; and material data management\nto support robust material design methodology.\n\n96\n\nCapabilities provided by this technology include:\n(1) Develop reliable process control and certification\nmethods for the manufacture of engine components for\nthe Space Launch System (SLS) by selective laser manufacturing (SLM), (2) Computational tools to enable\nprocess control with a reduced reliance on trial-anderror approaches will accelerate the development cycle,\n(3) Simulation of the behavior of components manufactured through the SLM process will be used to inform\nthe certification process to reduce the testing burden\nand the associated time and cost for future additively\nmanufactured components, and (4) Evaluate optimal\nmaterial configurations for advanced woven thermal\nprotection systems (TPS) concepts. These highly tailorable material architectures allow for TPS to be designed\nfor specific mission requirements. However, with this\nability to tailor the material architecture creates a large\ndesign space that is impractical to explore through fabrication, as these systems are costly to build and test.\nConsequently, computationally assisted design is being\nimplemented to assist the design process. Additionally,\nthese design tools will be evaluated for use in predicting\nthe response of these materials to operational regimes\nthat cannot be examined in the laboratory.\n\nAnticipated Benefits\nSynergistic efforts in multiscale modeling, information\nmanagement, experimental characterization, and materials processing will accelerate design, development,\nand sustainment of ultra-durable material systems.\nThe quantitative impact includes the reduced time\nbetween discovery and technology insertion by at least\nhalf relative to current practice; shorter maturation and\ninsertion period can translate to lower costs, greater\naffordability, and lower risk of failure; and integration\nof materials certification within a comprehensive computational approach will reduce time and cost to certify\nnew flight hardware.\n\nPotential Applications\nComputational materials tools will be developed in\nclose collaboration with existing projects. These tools\nwill be applied to improve manufacturing processes and\n\nmaterials performance while also reducing the cost and\ntime to insert new materials and processes into NASA\napplications. For the SLS project, computational tools\nwill focus on reducing manufacturing variability, and\npart certification to reduce cost and time to infuse new\nparts. For the conformal TPS project, trade studies for\ncomponent architecture will be developed to virtually examine multiple configurations, as manufacturing multiple configurations is not financially viable to\ndownselect potential systems.\n\nHybrid weave concept of a 3D conformal TPS\nto be analyzed for thermomechanical behavior.\n\nNotable Accomplishments\t\n\nPhysics-based model of powder bed heating\nfor selective laser melting.\n\nA near-infrared camera system has been developed and\ncalibrated to monitor the melt pool for metallic additive manufacturing systems. Thermal maps of the melt\npool and semi-solidus areas have been analyzed to\ndevelop algorithms to track and quantify the melt pool\narea. These algorithms have been used to create closed\nloop control for an additive manufacturing system to\nimprove manufacturing quality and to demonstrate\nimproved process reliability.\nMicromechanical simulations of 2D TPS weaves have\nbeen developed to assist in initial downselect of novel\nwoven TPS designs.\n\nMultiscale simulation utilizing aggregate dislocation behavior\nfor crack growth in a material formed\nby additive manufacturing.\n\nGCD\n97\n\n'
