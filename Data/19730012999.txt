Wavelength range\n2. Resolution:\n5. Sensitivity:\n\n1 <_ A < 1 0 i\n0|\n\n500-1,000 = AA/A\nAs high as possible, preferably photon\nnoise limited.\n\n4. Ease of Operation:\n\nThe spectrometer is to be used on a\n\nground based telescope.\n\nIt should be\n\ncapable of operating with the C-l4l\nairborne telescope.\n5. Date Reduction:\xe2\x80\xa2 Preference should be given to systems\nrequiring only limited data analysis.\nAt the time the proposal was written, a Michelson interferometer seemed to be the best choice,,\n\nHowever, extended\n\ndiscussions with Michelson users convinced us that the problems\nof mechanical stability at A \xc2\xab 1 | are very severe.\n0i\n\nAt the time\n\nthe proposal was accepted by NASA, a type of compact Littrow\ngrating monochromator had been designed.\nshown in Figure !\xe2\x80\x9e\n\nThe optical layout is\n\nThe instrument consists of a small Cassegrain\n\ncollimator-telescope and a standard Bausch and Lomb diffraction\ngrating.\n\nBy operating the grating in the Littrow mode and using\n\nCassegrain optics, a very compact unit results.\nhas been fabricated and is shown in Figure 2.\n\nThe spectrometer\nIt is 10" long,\n\n5" diameter and weighs 4 pounds including optics and detector0\n\nThe sensitivity of the system is limited only by the photon\nnoise in the input beam since the entire spectrometer is designed\nto operate at 4\xc2\xb0K0\n\nIn this mode of operation, the sensitivity\n\nof the system will be fully equal to that of a Michelson interferometer,,\n\nThe spectrometer accepts all of the light in a 3 mm\n\ndiameter aperture in the focal plane of the telescope.\n\nThis\n\ncorresponds to 15-30" for most ground based telescopes and is\nadequate for most observational programs.\nAfter completion of the building phase, the spectrometer\nwas modified by Dr. Carl Frederick to be used on the NASA Leased\nLear Jet. His first series of field tests, 4-22 September 1972\nshowed that the instrument functioned well although difficulties\nwith the aircraft prevented a full test of its sensitivity,,\n\nIIo\n\nLiquid Helium Cooled Ebert Spectrometer\nMany observations require less resolving power than is\n\nproduced by the long focus Cassegrain system.\n\nThese observations\n\ninclude observation of planetary atmospheres (where pressure\nbroadening considerably broadens emission and absorption lines)\nand faint sources which are inexcessible to the high resolution\ninstrument.\nA drawing of the spectrometer is shown in Figure 2C\n\nAs\n\nshown two detectors are used.\n\nDetector #1 is sensitive to\n\nradiation in the l6-28p. band.\n\nDetector #2 covers the 20-40|i\n\nband.\n\nIn this configurattion Detector #1 (Ge:Cu) operates\n\nin first order.\nin second order,,\n\nDetector #2 (GerZn) simultaneously operates\nOrder separation is accomplished by an\n\ninterference filter operating in conjunction with a reststrahlen\nmirror.\n\nIn this configuration the spectrometer will be used to\n\nmake measurements of the atmosphere of Jupiter in the l6-40nband.\n\nAs shown by J. B. Pollack emission measurements made\n\nin this band can be used to determine the mass ratio of Hp/He\nin the planetary atmosphere,,\nThe spectrometer can also be operated with two Ge:Cu\ndetectors both operating in first order.\n\nBy using two detectors\n\nthe observation time can be cut in half.\n\nMore detectors could\n\nbe used, however, the signal processing becomes increasingly\ncomplex.\n. Figure 5 shows a spectral scan of a 500\xc2\xb0C blackbody with\nand without an 0.002" Mylar film in the beam.\n\nThe entrance\n\naperture was 5.5 mm i-n diameter so the spectral resolution is\ndegraded by approximately a factor of 3.\nFigure 4- shows a spectral scan of the Orion Nebula taken\nwith a 3-5 mm entrance aperture.\n\nThe data shown has not been\n\nnormalized for the instrumental response (Figure 3).\n\nAll of\n\nthe data was collected on a single Lear Jet flight on 16\nNovember 1972.\nThe spectra in Figures 3 and 4 were taken using a single\nGe:Cu detector which was made here at Cornell.\n\nFIGURE CAPTIONS\n\nFigure 1.\n\nA schematic view of the liquid helium cooled\nCassegrain spectrometer is shown.\n\nThe spectrometer\n\nhas a resolution A/AA = 500 at 10(JL\xc2\xab\nFigure 2.\n\nA schematic, view of the liquid helium cooled\nEbert spectrometer is shown.\n\nThe spectrometer has\n\na resolution A/AA = 100 at 15 M-.\nFigure 3.\n\nA spectral scan of a 500\xc2\xb0C blackbody with and\nwithout.a 0.002" Mylar film.\n\n\' \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe scan was\n\nmade with the instrument shown in Figure 2.\n\nA 3.5\n\nmillimeter entrance aperture was used which degraded\nthe instruments resolution to ~ 30.\nFigure 4.\n\nA spectral scan of the Orion Nebula taken with\na 3.5 mm entrance aperture and a resolution of\n\n-30.\n\n.\n\n0>\n\nI\n\nCO\n\nDetector\n\nDetector\nPrimary\nMirror\n\nGrating\n\nEntrance Aperture\n\nRgure 2.\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nLiquid Helium Cooled Spectrometer\n125mm Focal Length f 15\n\n10\n-^.\n/ \\ Gain x 2\n\n9\n8\n\n500\xc2\xb0C Black Body\n7\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\nI\n0\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n\xc2\xbb \xc2\xbb i i iVivrTM\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\nWavelength C/o\n\nFigure 3.\n\nI\n8\n\nn\n\nI\n\nI\n\n\' I\n\nOrion Nebula\nNASA Lear Jet\n12" /7 Telescope\n16 November 1972\n\no\no> 5\n<7>\n0)\n\n^>\no 4\no>\nCC\n\n14\n\n16\n\n. 1 , 1 . 1 , 1\n18\n\n20\n22\n24\nWavelength (>J\n\n, 1 , 1 , I\n26\n\n28\n\n3O\n\nFigure 4.\n\n'
