b'JSC/EC5 U.S. Spacesuit Knowledge Capture Series Synopsis\nTopic: Kosmo\xe2\x80\x99s Farewell Advice\nDate: December 6, 2011\n\nLocation: Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, TX\n\nPresenter: Joe Kosmo interviewed by Amy J. Ross\nSynopsis: Joe Kosmo shared some final words and advice for his teammates in the Spacesuit and Crew\nSurvival Systems Branch (EC5) and the Crew and Thermal Systems Division (CTSD (EC)) upon his\nretirement. He knew nothing about spacesuits when he started working for NASA in 1961, but neither\ndid anyone else. He summed up the best lessons learned during his 50 years of developing U.S.\nspacesuits and encouraged the next generation\xe2\x80\x99s space industry workers to challenge what they hear\nand decide what is right.\nBiography: Joseph Kosmo was graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 1961 with a bachelor of\nscience in aeronautical engineering. In 1978, he earned a master of science in environmental\nmanagement from the University of Houston \xe2\x80\x93 Clear Lake. In 1961, Kosmo began his career with the\nNASA Space Task Group at Langley, Virginia, in the Crew Systems Division, working on the Mercury\nProgram spacesuit. During the past 45 years, he has participated in the design, development, and testing\nof Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and Space Shuttle spacesuits, as well as numerous advanced\ntechnology configuration spacesuits and EVA gloves for future mission applications. Kosmo received the\nAmerican Astronautical Society\xe2\x80\x99s Victor A. Prather Award, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, and the\nAstronaut Silver Snoopy Award. The United States Space Foundation Space Technology Hall of Fame\nrecognized him for his work on the development of the liquid cooling garment for spacesuit and medical\napplications. He has pursued the development of advanced spacesuits, gloves, and ancillary EVAsupporting hardware concepts for future planetary surface exploration. For about 10 years, Kosmo has\norganized and led a team of engineers in a series of remote field site test activities of prototype\nextravehicular hardware, advanced communications systems, spacesuit mobility studies, and human\nand robot assistant interactive capabilities in a variety of locations, including Death Valley, the Mojave\nDesert, and northern Arizona. In 2011, he retired from NASA after a 50-year career in the space industry.\nVideo Length and Size: 1:27:32 (3.074 GB)\n\nNASA Johnson Space Center\nCrew and Thermal Systems Division\nEC5 Space Suit and Crew Survival Systems Branch\n2101 NASA Parkway\nHouston, TX, 77058\njsc-us-s pacesuit-knowledgecapture@m ail.nasa.gov\n\nJoe Kosmo referenced or read from several files during his interview and\nthey have been provided below in the following order.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nRichard S.

The interviewer is Summer Chick Bergen. Camera is Carol Butler, audio\nis Shannon Rinde.\nMr. Johnston, thank you for being with us and giving us the honor of doing this oral\nhistory interview.\n\nWe appreciate it.\n\nLet\'s start, basically, at the beginning of your\n\ninvolvement with NASA. How did you get involved with working at NASA?\n\nJOHNSTON: Well, I was working at Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C., and I heard\nthey were setting up NASA, a thing called the Space Task Group [STG]. I submitted an\napplication to NASA headquarters. About two weeks went by, and I called a guy named\nGeorge [M.] Low and said, "I haven\'t heard anything from you."\nHe said, "I can\'t understand that. You\'ll hear from somebody this afternoon."\nI got a call from a guy named Bob [Robert R.] Gilruth, who was the director. He said,\n"You haven\'t heard from Max [Maxime A.] Faget yet?"\nI said, "No." [Laughter]\nSo he said, "Well, Max will call you this afternoon."\nSo Max called and we talked a few minutes. Max, by the way, probably one of the\nsmartest guys that worked at NASA. Anyhow, he said, "Yes, we want to hire you. We\'d like\nyou to come to work tomorrow." [Laughter]\nSo I said, "Wait a minute. I\'m living in Washington, D.C., and you\'re down in\nVirginia." I said, "Why don\'t I drive down tomorrow and meet you and find out what you\nreally want me to do."\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-1\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nSo I drove down by myself and I met with Max. Max is a very smart guy, but he\'s\nhard to understand. He really is. Anyhow, I talked to him for about an hour, and then I drove\naround looking at housing.\nMy wife and I just bought a new home up outside of Washington, D.C. So I drove\nback home and we were sitting in front of the fireplace, and I said, "You know, I met this guy\nnamed Max Faget." I said, "I really didn\'t understand what he wanted me to do. I know he\'s\nsmarter than hell, but I don\'t know what he wants."\nSo my wife says, "Why don\'t we drive back down tomorrow."\nSo I drove back down the next day and I met a guy named Bob [Robert O.] Piland.\nBob made a lot more sense and whatever. Anyhow, within two weeks I moved. We put the\nhouse that we just bought, we rented it, because we thought we were coming back up to\nwhere the Goddard Space Center is.\nAnyhow, we moved down there and we rented a house. I went in primarily to worry\nabout the environmental control system for the Mercury spacecraft. I was there a month or\nso, and nobody was really taking care of the spacesuits.\n\nI knew something about the\n\nspacesuits, because I\'d worked at the Bureau of Aeronautics and was involved with\nunderstanding that sort of thing. So I went to Max and said, "Max, who\'s taking care of the\nspacesuits?"\nHe said, "Well, really no one. Why don\'t go out to Rayfield [phonetic] and talk to\nthem."\nSo I went out there. Then I came back and I went in and talked to Max again. I said,\n"Max, you know what? The Air Force, they\'re forcing you all to take their suit. It isn\'t the\nright suit."\nSo he said, "Well, why don\'t you go back out there and set up an evaluation program."\nHe said, "One of those suits, you think?"\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-2\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nI said, "Well, you ought to look at the Navy suit. You ought look at a suit that\nInternational Latex [Corporation] built."\nSo I went back out there and talked to them. I was in a big circle, and told these Air\nForce people, I said, "We\'re going to evaluate three suits." I said, "We\'ll do it here." Well,\nboy, they jumped all over me. I said, "Well, I\'m going to tell you something, if the people I\nwork for don\'t want to support me, I\'m going to resign, but I\'m not going to take this kind of\nstuff from you people."\nSo anyhow, we did the evaluation there. You would know that they came in and said\nthey ought to pick the David Clark [Company] suit, which was the wrong suit. So we ended\nup picking the B. F. Goodrich suit. So that was how I got started in the spacesuit business. I\nhired a guy to handle the ECS [Environmental Control System] and I hired a guy to handle\nthe suits.\nThen there was an animal program, and there\'s a guy named Jim [James P.] Henry\nwas going to run it, a colonel in the Air Force. He wasn\'t coming in until summer. I went to\na meeting and somebody said, "Did anybody take any notes?"\nI said, "I did." So I wrote the minutes of that meeting.\nSo a guy named Charlie [Charles J.] Donlan, who was a deputy director, he said,\n"These notes are wonderful. Why don\'t you run the animal program."\nI said, "Okay." So I took over the animal program. So I had the ECS, the suits, the\nanimal program, and the bioinstrumentation. I got three or four people working for me. One\nday they called me and they said, "You know, we\'ve got these doctors and no one\'s paying\nany attention to them. They do what they want. We\'re going to put them altogether in a\nbranch. Stan [Stanley C.] White will be the branch head and you\'ll be the assistant branch\nhead. You run the place."\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-3\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nSo that\'s how I got started. I don\'t know, it was a whole bunch of things. Working in\nthe Mercury Program was like going into a candy shop. There was so many things you could\ndo. You just had to say, "I\'ll do them."\nBut anyhow, I didn\'t mean to tell you the whole story of my life. But they were\nexciting days. I got to know all the original seven astronauts.\nI\'ll tell, you know, Alan [B.] Shepard [Jr.] just died two weeks ago. I had a meeting\nwith all the seven astronauts and I said, "I\'m going to tell you what we\'re going to do. We\'re\ngoing to buy you a training suit, a flight suit, and a back-up suit."\nAlan Shepard said, "If I were Bob Gilruth, I\'d fire you."\nI said, "Oh, really?" I said, "Why don\'t you sit there and be quiet and let me explain\nthis to you." So I went through, I said, "Do you need a training suit? Do you want to fly with\nit?"\nHe said, "No."\nOkay. I said, "You\'re down at the Cape [Canaveral, Florida], you\'re ready to go, and\nthe zipper on your flight suit breaks. Would you like a back-up?"\nHe said, "Yes."\nI said, "Well, then what I just told you makes sense." And we were friends from then\non. [Laughter]\nSo anyhow, they were good days. Working in the Space Task Group with Gilruth and\nCharlie Donlan and Max Faget. I can\'t remember other people. But I just loved my job. I\nwent to work every day, I got up in the morning and I was really ready to go. My whole\ncareer with NASA was that way.\nWe finally, they started Gemini, and by that time I probably had, I don\'t know, maybe\nthirty or forty people in that branch. They announced that we were going to move to\nHouston. In fact, I came down here and picked a building out up on Wayside Drive that was\nwhere our crew systems was located. Actually, it was called life systems then. We got\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-4\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\ninvolved with\xe2\x80\x94well, in fact, we\'d bought the first altitude chamber that the center had and\nput in the old Lane Wells Building up on Wayside Drive. They were just great days. Just\ngreat days. We ended up with all the medical people working in the division for a long time,\nuntil Chuck [Charles A.] Berry decided we ought to move them out and he should have them.\nBut I really enjoyed running that division. We just did a lot of stuff.\nThen Gemini came along and we needed a new suit. So we actually went to the Air\nForce suit and used it for all the flights in Gemini.\n\nWe ended up making an EVA\n\n[Extravehicular Activity] suit. We had a fourteen-day mission and we even made a soft suit\nthat the guys could put on and take off.\nI\'m trying to think what else I could tell you about the spacesuits. The suit business\nwas, I think, one of the most interesting parts of the job I had. The environmental control\nsystem was being built by Air Research. I had a branch that managed that and we had\nanother branch and handled the medical instrumentation and whatever. I really had a group\nof people working for me in crew systems that were just great people. We all respected each\nother. We didn\'t have any fights or arguments. Once in a while, I had to fire somebody, but\nnot often. I just loved running crew systems. It was probably the best job I ever had at\nNASA.\nAnyhow, we did all the things we had to do for Gemini. You know, I could probably,\nI guess if I really reach back in my mind, could tell you stories of things we did. Our first\nEVA, George Low came back from the Cape and about a week before the first Gemini\nlaunch, the Russians had gone EVA. So he called me and Chuck [Charles W.] Matthews,\nDeke [Donald K.] Slayton, and Warren [J.] North over to his office. He said, "Could we go\nEVA on the next mission?"\nI said, "George, I don\'t know."\nThis is on a Thursday. He said, "Why don\'t you go over and I want your division to\nhandle all of it, including that zip gun, and you handle getting that hardware built."\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-5\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nI said, "Okay."\nHe said, "I don\'t want anybody to know we\'re doing this."\nI said, "All right."\nSo I went back to my office, I told my secretary, I said, "I want you to cancel all my\nappointments tomorrow. There\'s a group of guys I want to have in the office tomorrow and\nwe\'re going to design a chest pack for that mission and the zip gun."\nAnd I walked into Low\'s office the following Tuesday with a mock-up of all these\nequipment. We built it in less than two and a half months and flew it. In fact, I have a\npicture of Ed [Edward H.] White [II] at home on my wall with that thing on. It was a great\nexperience. That\'s the only crew that came by my office on the way to the Cape to thank me\nand the people who worked for me, for what we did for them.\nI went to an IEF meeting in Paris about, I don\'t know, a month or so after this. Ed\nWhite and Jim [James A.] McDivitt came over with, I guess, Lyndon [B.] Johnson. I got a\ncall saying I should meet them out at the Paris Air Show. Well, I gave my paper. I didn\'t\nhave any money, but I figured how I\'d get out there. I went out and I watched the gate. One\ngate would open for people to go through. So I stood there and I thought, "Oh, hell, I\'m going\nto get my NASA badge out. I\'ll just hold it and walk on in." So I did. [Laughter]\nI walked on over to a building where there was a big press conference going on.\nThere were a lot of people there, just a lot of people. Anyhow, I walked into that thing and I\ndidn\'t get up on the stage and I didn\'t do any talking, but as we were getting ready to leave,\nsomebody said, "Would you like us to fly you back in the center of Paris on a helicopter?"\nI said, "Sure, I\'d love it."\nSo anyhow, I did, and they invited me to a party they were having that night. Funny\nthing is, we left the NASA administrator sitting out at the airport.\n\nHe was talking.\n\n[Laughter]\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-6\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nBut anyhow, I\'ve had a lot of good experiences like that. In fact, I\'d spent so little\ntime with my family, we were going to up to a ranch up in the hill country as soon as I got\nback. Mr. [James E.] Webb told me, I was in the car with him and he said, "You want to fly\nback on the Air Force One with us?"\nI said, "Hell, I\'d love to."\nHe said, "Well, be at the airport Sunday morning and you\'ll be on board." He said,\n"Call this guy."\nSo I called some guy that worked for him. I said, "You know, Mr. Webb invited me\nto ride back on Air Force One with you all."\nHe said, "I don\'t know if we\'re going to have room for you. Why don\'t you just bring\nyour bags and come out to the airport and if we\'ve got room, we\'ll let you get on board. If\nnot, I don\'t know what you\'re going to do."\nI said, "I\'m going to tell you something, fellow. I\'ve worked my butt off the last two\nmonths to get Ed White EVA going and I\'m not coming out there and wasting my time. If\nyou can\'t tell me I don\'t have a seat on the airplane, I\'m not going." So I went on, I had a firstclass seat on a flight back to New York.\nAbout a month later, Webb came through with some visitors and he said, "Boy, where\nwere you on that airplane?"\nI said, "Mr. Webb, I shouldn\'t say this, but I\'m going to. You\'ve got a bunch of jerks\nworking for you."\nHe said, "Really?"\nI said, "Yes." I said, "I talked to them on the phone like you told me to, and they told\nme to come out to the airport. They didn\'t know if there\'d be room." I said, "I worked night\nand day for a couple of months getting this thing done, and, frankly, I\'ve neglected my family.\nI wasn\'t going out to the airport and sit around and watch you all take off and then I got to go\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-7\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nfigure out how I\'m going to get back home." I said, "I had a first-class seat on an airplane and\nif the guys working for you don\'t any more about me than that, I wasn\'t worried about it."\nWell, Gilruth was standing there, he didn\'t know what to say. [Laughter] But I\ntreated people like that. I mean, you got to be willing to say what you feel like. I got along\nwell with Mr. Webb.\nI don\'t know what else I could tell you about Gemini. Gemini was a very interesting\nprogram. We built a special suit for the fourteen-day mission, which was a soft suit that the\nguys could take off. I don\'t know really what else I could tell you about the program. Well,\nwe had a lot of medical experiments. I still had the medical people working for me, that we\ndid in the Gemini Program.\nWhile I was over on a flight, I went into England and I went out to Fornborough\n[phonetic] to give a paper. There was a guy named John Billingham, who was a flight\nsurgeon. He was interested in coming over here to work. So I went by his house and spent\nthe evening with he and his wife. We brought John over. John, he stayed with us quite a\nwhile, but he ended up going out to the Ames Research Center. His wife is a physician, also.\nHe was a great addition to our staff. He really was. But the Fornborough thing was, it was\nfun giving the paper. I don\'t know where I went from there. But anyhow, I guess, I went on\nover into Paris. I don\'t know. I used to go to Europe quite a bit. But John Billingham was a\ngreat find.\nLet\'s see. What else can I tell you about Gemini? The Gemini Program was a very\ninteresting spacecraft and the systems and everything you built into it.\n\nWe had some\n\nproblems with some of the stuff at times, but, by and large, it was a good program. Some of\nthe astronauts got into problems when they were EVA. I think that we learned a lot about\nEVA from that program. I really don\'t know what else I could say about Gemini. I think we\nlearned an awful lot about the medical aspects of space flight from Gemini. We did a lot of\nexperiments.\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-8\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nI had a guy named Larry Dietman [phonetic]. He\'s still out there. He was a Public\nHealth physician. But we had quite a group of medical experiments that we carried on. The\nbiggest flights that we did those on was, I think, Gemini VII was the biggest one. We really\nhad a pile of stuff that we did with those guys. I don\'t know what else I can say about the\nmedical aspects of Gemini. I think we did learn an awful lot. We published some good\nreports from that mission. I don\'t know what else I can say about Gemini. We had good\nsuits.\nI had two branches in the division. One took care of the Apollo stuff and then another\ngroup took care of the Gemini stuff. They were a great group of people. Several of them\nhave died, which is unfortunate.\n\nTed Hayes [phonetic], Jim Corrielli [phonetic], Matt\n\n[Matthew I.] Radnofsky they all had worked for the Navy and I had gotten to know them\nwhen I was in the Bureau of Aeronautics.\nThen we got some people from the Air Force. Charlie Lutz [phonetic]. I\'m trying to\nthink who else. But anyhow, we had a very good group of people that were loyal to each\nother and took care of each other. We just had a good group of people who relied on each\nother. Nobody took offense when somebody called them down on something or whatever.\nWe all trusted each other, and that\'s how that division succeeded.\nIn fact, I won\'t get into the Apollo fire right now, but it was right after the Apollo fire,\nI was working for Max. Max had a habit of never showing up for George Low\'s change\nboards, and it really infuriated Low that Max would show up late to these meetings. He\nwould lock the door. [Laughter] He would do all sorts of things.\nI got worried that Low was going to move the spacesuits out of my division. So I\ncalled Max and I said, "Max, what the hell\'s going on? Why is Low going to move the suits\nout of my division? There isn\'t anything he\'s ever asked us to do that we haven\'t done and\nwe\'ve done it well."\nHe said, "What do you want me to do?"\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-9\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nI said, "Get him over to your office."\nSo I went over and George came in and I said, "George, why are you moving the suits\nout of crew systems?" I said, "If you\'ve got a problem with Max, take it out on Max, but\ndon\'t take it out on me."\nWell, we talked for a while and he said, "Okay. I won\'t do it." So we kept the\nspacesuits.\nGeorge Low, he\'s dead now. He got cancer and he died. But George was really one\nof the strongest people that I ever met. After the Apollo fire, he was the deputy director, but\nhe took over the management of the Apollo Program. I never went in my office that there\nwasn\'t a memo on my desk that George Low had written, every morning. There are people in\nthe program that were exceptional people. George Low was one of them, Max Faget was one\nof them, Bob Gilruth was one of them. But George Low was just a superb person.\nIt\'s sad he got cancer and died. In fact, he was down at M. D. Anderson [Hospital],\nand I got a call from one of the secretaries out there saying that George had called and wanted\nme to drop in and see him. I left NASA in about 1980 and I was working at the Medical\nCenter. So I went over to M. D. Anderson and stopped in to talk to George. His wife was\nthere. I spent about five minutes, ten minutes, and I started to leave. He said, "Don\'t leave.\nStay and talk to me a while." So I must have stayed there for an hour. He died about a week\nlater. He was an exceptional man. An exceptional man. He really was. He was a good\nleader. He was devoted to what he was doing. He was an extraordinary person. He really\nwas. But he\'s gone. In fact, a lot of people like him are gone.\nOkay. What do you want me to cover now? Apollo?\n\nBERGEN: Well, we can go to Apollo, if you\'d like.\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-10\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nJOHNSTON: I don\'t know what else I can tell you about Gemini. The Gemini Program was a\nvery interesting program. There were, I think, twelve flights. The longest one was fourteen\ndays long and we had several others. There were some great guys that flew in that program.\nMike [Michael] Collins was one. John [W.] Young was a great guy. Ed White was probably\none of the best astronauts that I ever knew. He\'d do anything in the world for you. When he\nwas burned to death in that fire, that was a tragic thing. In fact, I went home, I was having\nsomebody to dinner and the guy couldn\'t come. I was sitting there and I got a phone call and\nthey said, "Dick, you\'d better come out here. We\'ve got a problem in the spacecraft."\nSo I went out to the Center. Then I found out they\'d had this fire and those three guys\nhad burned to death. Joe [Joseph F.] Shea was running the Apollo Program Office then and\nhe called me, and he said, "Gulf Stream is going to leave in about an hour to Cape." He said,\n"I\'d like you to go down there with us."\nSo I said, "Okay."\nSo we flew down. There was a guy named Frank [H.] Samonski, who worked for me,\nwho went with me. They put us up in the crew quarters, which I hated. But I spent about ten\ndays down there looking at the spacesuits and whatever. I think really, as a result of that,\nmost of us came back with a renewed feeling that we needed to do more to make that thing\nsafer.\nI was invited\xe2\x80\x94not invited, I was directed to go up and testify before the Senate Space\nCommittee, which I did. Funny thing is, on the way back we landed up at Hobby [Airport]\nand a big ball of flame busted out of the wing right up in the window by where I was sitting,\nwhich scared me to death. It was a tough time in my life, it really was.\nBut I think everybody who worked for me, and I had a lot of very devoted people, we\ntrusted each other. We worked well together. We all got together and said, "Look, we\'re\ngoing to get this straightened out," and we did. But they were tough times. For Gus [Virgil\nI.] Grissom and Ed White and Roger [B.] Chaffee that died in that fire, it was just something\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-11\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nthat shouldn\'t have happened. Part of the reason that happened was there was a lack of\ndiscipline in what they put in the spacecraft. Now, we got blamed for having 100 percent\noxygen, and that was a contributing factor, but that thing was just full of all sorts of stuff and\nwhen it went off, it went off like a bomb.\nThat was a tough period in my life, I\'ll tell you. It really was. I really had kind of a\nrededication to doing what I thought was right for the program. I got all the people working\nfor me together in our conference room and we went over and talked about it. Consequently,\nwe did an awful lot of things. We come up with new materials that wouldn\'t burn. We just\ndid a lot of stuff. We also changed the atmosphere, so that it was not 100 percent oxygen on\nthe pad, which was not a good thing. In retrospect, I understand that now.\nThere was a guy in headquarters that was trying to get me fired because we had that.\nHe blamed it on me, which is okay. But it wasn\'t my fault, any more than it was anybody\nelse\'s, because we had 100 percent oxygen in Mercury, 100 percent oxygen in Gemini. The\nproblem was the lack of discipline in what they had in the spacecraft. I don\'t know where the\nspark came from that started it, but it was just like a bomb when it went off.\nI\'ll always remember, I was down there, I went out on the airplane when they loaded\nthose caskets on board the plane. That was just almost more than I could take to watch them\nload those guys on. But I came back with a new dedication to doing what I thought was right\nand we did. We did. I don\'t know why I\'m telling you the story of my life, but they were\ntough days.\nWhere do you want to go from here? Do you want to talk more about Apollo or\nGemini, Skylab, what?\n\nBERGEN: We can talk some more about Apollo if you\'d like to talk some more about Apollo.\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-12\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nJOHNSTON: Okay. Well, it was funny. I got pretty close to Dr. Gilruth as a result of that fire.\nHe called me one day and he said, "Dick, would you come over here? I want to talk to you\nabout something." He said, "Would you mind coming over as my special assistant?"\nI said, "Gosh, I don\'t know. I love the job I have. I\'ve got to think about it overnight."\nHe said, "Sure."\nSo I went home and talked to my wife and I said, "You know, the old man wants me\nto come over there. I hate leaving crew systems, but if he wants me, I better do it."\nSo I called him the next day and he said, "Come on up."\nSo I said, "Yes, I\'ll come over."\nThere\'d been a guy named Paul [E.] Purser there. That\'s whose job I took. He walked\nout and left everything in his office. So I go over and his secretary\'s there and I said, "Would\nyou go get some boxes?"\nShe said, "Why?"\nI said, "I want to box all this junk up." I said, "I got all the stuff in my office I\'m\ngoing to bring over here and I don\'t want Purser\'s stuff around." So I took over the office.\nI was about four or five months into that job, maybe even six, and Gilruth called me\nin and he said, "The lunar receiving lab is in terrible trouble." He said, "If we don\'t get it\nstraightened out, it\'s probably going to delay us going for Apollo 11." He said, "Could you\ngo there and straighten it out?"\nI said, "If you want me to, I\'ll be happy to."\nSo I went over. I got everybody together in a big conference room there. I said,\n"Look, I\'ve been asked to come over here to straighten this place out. This place is a mess\nand you know it. We\'re going to get it done and we\'re going to get it done in time for the\nApollo launch, so stand by."\nI got a couple of guys that I knew well, had them come over with me, and we\nstraightened that place out. There was a sign that was from\xe2\x80\x94I can\'t think of his name now.\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-13\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nAnyhow, I had a bright sport coat on and he made some smart remark about my sport coat. I\nlooked down and this guy\'s got sandals on and no socks. [Laughter] So I said, "Hey, look,\nany son of a bitch that doesn\'t have enough sense to wear socks, why are you picking on my\nsport coat?" Well, he and a couple other guys went over to Gilruth\'s office and protested him\nsending me over there. When the mission was over, they went over and said it was the\nsmartest thing he ever did, because we got the thing on line and it all worked. And I worked\nmy butt off on that thing.\nIn fact, I was invited to go out to Hawaii, take my wife, and I told Jean, "Jean, I really\ndon\'t feel like going to Hawaii. If you want to go, I\'ll go, but I don\'t want to do it." I said, "I\nhaven\'t been around you and the kids for so long, that I\'d just as soon take a week off and let\'s\ngo someplace on vacation by ourselves."\nSo I called the people back from Litman [phonetic]. Women couldn\'t understand why\nI wouldn\'t do it. I said, "Well, I\'ve been working eighteen hours a day for the last two months\nor three months. I\'ve never been to Hawaii, but as much as I would like to go, I think I owe\nmy family more than going to Hawaii."\nSo she said, "Okay." So they got somebody else to go. But we would have had a\ngrand trip. They were first-class seats and whatever.\nAfter that mission was over, I\'ll tell you what I did. Jean and I got invited to the\npresidential dinner that [President Richard M.] Nixon flew out in California after that. We\nflew out there and stayed in the Century Plaza Hotel. It was a glorious night. I met more\npeople that I never, ever thought I would meet. [Laughter]\nBut anyhow, I stayed there as Gilruth\'s special assistant for the better part of a year.\nThen one day Jim McDivitt called me. He was running the Apollo Program Office. He said,\n"Would you mind coming down and talking to me for a minute?"\nI said, "No, Jim. What do you want?"\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-14\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nHe said, "I need somebody to handle the government-furnished equipment and\ndevelop the experiments for the next three missions."\nI said, "Well, I\'ll tell you the truth, you know, I like the job working for Gilruth, but\nI\'m not really involved in hardware and stuff. I\'m a hardware-oriented person. I don\'t want to\nmake a career out of that job up there. It\'s not going to lead me to anything." So I said,\n"Look, I\'ll go up and tell the old man you want me to come down there and, yes, I\'ll come\ndown."\nSo I went down and went to work for him. Well, I took my family to the Cape to see\na launch. They wouldn\'t let my son into the viewing area, which really just irritated me. So\nwe went out on the island and Apollo 13 was launched. That\'s the one that had the big\nproblem.\nSo we drove on out to the island and were starting back, and we heard that they\'d had\nthis problem in flight. So I said to Jean, "Jean, I think I\'d better get on back to the [Johnston\nSpace] Center as quick as I can."\nSo we stopped somewhere, I don\'t know where it was, someplace in Florida and then\nwe drove all the way on in. What a mess that was. It really was a terrible mess. I got\ninvolved with the accident investigation and a lot of other stuff. That should never have\nhappened. The sad thing about it, after the Apollo fire, I think everything in the spacecraft\nhad been looked at, except the wiring in that oxygen tank. It was a spark, and when that\nspark went off, it blew that tank off, which blew the side of the spacecraft or the service\nmodule off. We were lucky we ever got those guys back.\nAnyhow, after that was over, I\'m sitting in my office one day and Dr. [Christopher C.]\nKraft [Jr.] and Dr. Gilruth\xe2\x80\x94and Chris Kraft called me. I go up and sit down and talk, and\nthey talk and they talk and they talk about Chuck Berry and the medical stuff and blah, blah,\nblah, blah. I finally said, "What are you guys driving at? Are you asking me if I\'ll go to work\nfor Chuck Berry?"\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-15\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nThey said, "Yes."\nI said, "Look, you know, I like Chuck personally. I don\'t think he\'s any manager. I\ndon\'t think you do. But if you want me to go there, I will." But I said, "I got one request, that\nI\'m going to run the hardware. I don\'t want him butting into it."\nThey said, "Well, if that\'s the way you want to do it, do it."\nSo I went to work for Berry. I went and hired three or four guys that worked for me in\ncrew systems and I hired a guy named John [C.] Stonesifer. Anyhow, I redid that branch and\nwe picked up and we took over and got all that hardware straightened out. In fact, we had a\nfifty\xe2\x80\x94oh, I don\'t know how long the thing was, a fifty-six-day chamber run with all this\nhardware and it all worked perfect. We had some problems which we corrected, but we\ndidn\'t have one problem in flight.\nThe Skylab Program was a very interesting program, especially from a medical\nviewpoint, because we flew, I don\'t know, twenty-eight or twenty-six days, and then a fiftytwo, and then, I think, an eighty-six-day mission. It was a great program. It really was.\nI remember after the second Skylab mission, Berry was up in headquarters and he had\nthis group of outside doctors. We went and briefed them, and the next thing we know, we get\na directive that we\'re going to have to put all the astronauts through, when they get back,\ninto\xe2\x80\x94I can\'t remember now what the hell they called it. They sent us a written directive that\nwe would do this. So I went up and talked to Gilruth. I guess Kraft was running the place by\nthen. I said, "Chris, I don\'t want to do this, but if we\'re going to do it, we\'re going to dry-run\non this before we go."\nSo the hospital, which is across the street, was not really occupied then, so we moved\nall of our gear over there. I had two doctors, one was a German, one was a British doctor. I\ngot the idea we ought to try to get some involvement of people from Europe. The guy\'s name\nis Ed Bachard [phonetic] and he was in excellent shape. He was the first guy we were going\nto put through these tests. We stopped his heart. Now, he survived. Well, they called me\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-16\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nand he said we just about killed him. I said, "Well, I\'m going to tell you what you do. I want\nyou to pack all that equipment up, move it back across the street."\nSo I went up to Kraft, and I said, "Chris, we just about killed somebody. I don\'t think\nwe ought to be doing this. If you\'ll back me, I\'m going to send a telegram to Berry and tell\nhim." In fact, Berry was going to be one of the subjects. I said, "I don\'t think we ought to do\nit, and if the management of the agency wants to do it, they can do it. But they\'re going to be\nresponsible for it, I\'m not." So Chuck came by my office and I said, "Chuck, you know, we\njust about killed Ed Bachard."\nHe said, "Yes. Well, what about it?"\nI said, "Well, we\'re not going to do the test after the mission. We\'ve sent a telegram\nup to the administrator and a copy of it to you. So you guys can do what you want. If you\nwant to direct us to do it, we\'ll do it, but we\'ll do it reluctantly." We never heard another\nword from them.\nThe administrator then was a guy named\xe2\x80\x94I can\'t even think of his name. He really\nwasn\'t much of an administrator. So anyway, we flew that last mission.\nI remember I went over and had dinner with the last Skylab crew. We had them in\nquarantine. I said, "Look, I want to tell you guys something. Chuck Berry\'s insisted we do\nthis. We don\'t want to do it. If any of you don\'t want to do it, then get your back-up to take\nyour place." But I said, "We\'re going to try not to do it."\nSo they said, "Okay." So they flew. I guess they were about two weeks into the\nmission when we had this problem. Somehow we got word to them not to worry about it,\nthey weren\'t going to have to do this. It was really kind of stupid for practitioners to be\ntelling us what to do for people who have been weightless for\xe2\x80\x94they were going to be\nweightless for eighty days and then bring them down and put them in a test like that. We\ncould have killed them.\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-17\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nSo anyhow, Skylab was a very interesting program. I guess the one thing I did when I\ntook over the directorate after Berry left, the astronauts always complained to me that the\nmedical people never, ever put a book out. So Apollo was just about over and I got all the\ndoctors together and all the Ph.D.s and whatever, and I said, "I want to tell you guys\nsomething. When the last thing\'s down, you guys stand by because we\'re going to write a\nbook about the medical results of Apollo," which we did and published it.\nThen after Skylab, we also published those results and we got the first publication out.\nWe had a big conference over in the Gilruth Center. Well, I don\'t think it\'s called the Gilruth\nCenter. But went through all the results. We got that done probably within two or three\nmonths after the last mission. It\'s a big, fat book, so big.\nI don\'t know what else I could tell you about Skylab. Skylab was a very interesting\nprogram to work on. It\'s too bad we didn\'t have something to keep the lab up there so we\ncould have gone back and revisited, but it burned up and came in in Australia, I think.\nThen after that was over, we tied up with the Russians for a mission with the ApolloSoyuz. Deke Slayton was one of the guys who was going to go. Deke, by the way, well, he\'s\njust like Al Shepard. Al never was able to fly in Gemini. He had some kind of an ear\nproblem. That was taken care of and he flew on Apollo 14.\nAnyhow, it was really not so much of an important scientific mission so much as it\nwas trying to do something with the Russians.\n\nThey rendezvoused and docked and\n\nexchanged stuff and so on, but when they came back in, somebody popped the relief valve\nand it let in some poisonous gas. We got word of that right after they landed. So I called\nChris and I said, "Chris, you know, we\'ve got a problem."\nHe said, "Well, I\'ll meet you out at the Center."\nSo we went out to the Center. It was late at night. We started calling around. We\nfound some quarters in Hawaii that we could take them to. We had to kick some generals\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-18\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nout, but we did. We brought the guys back and they spent probably ten days over there until\nwe were sure they were okay. Then we brought them on home.\nDeke Slayton, by the way, was a great guy. He did not like, particularly, Berry. Not\nmany of the astronauts did. When I took it over, I went up to his office and I said, "Deke, I\ndidn\'t ask for this job; I got it. I\'m willing to sit down and talk to you about anything we\'re\ngoing to do. If you don\'t like it, then we can talk about whether we\'re going to change it or\nwhatever." But I said, "I think it would be better if you and just decided that what we\'re\ngoing to do and do it." So that\'s the kind of way I dealt with him.\n\nJOHNSTON: He only went to the director on one thing, and the director supported me and not\nhim. Unfortunately, he got\xe2\x80\x94I don\'t know what he had, but he had some kind of cancer that\ntook him away. But he was a great guy. In fact, that whole original seven, it was just a good\ngroup of people. Well, the best one was John H. Glenn [Jr.]. The next was Al Shepard. The\nnext one was Deke Slayton. From there on it kind of went downhill. Wally [Walter M.]\nSchirra [Jr.], when he flew his Apollo mission, he decided he didn\'t want the cameras on and\nhe didn\'t want this on and he didn\'t want that, and he pulled all his plugs up there. Well, that\ninfuriated Chris Kraft, and Wally never flew again. Neither did the two guys that were with\nhim. But the rest of the guys, they were okay, but they weren\'t the quality of people that\nGlenn and Al Shepard and Deke were.\nWhat else can I tell you? You know, I could go back into a lot of stuff with you all. I\ndon\'t if that\'s what you really want.\n\nBERGEN: We\'d love for you to.\n\nJOHNSTON: Really?\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-19\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nBERGEN: Yes. If you want to do another interview another day to go more in-depth into\nthings, we can do that, too.\n\nJOHNSTON: Well, I don\'t mind coming back over here another day. I\'ll get some notes\ntogether and talk about some of the things that I think would be interesting.\n\nBERGEN: Okay.\n\nJOHNSTON: You know, you have a tendency when you\'re doing something like this, to talk\nabout the people and whatever went on. That\'s interesting, but I think a lot of things that\nhave to do with the hardware and how it all fit together. Let me think about it. Maybe I\'ll run\nover next week.\n\nBERGEN: Okay. That would be wonderful. That would be wonderful. We can do that. We\ncan talk more in-depth and we can talk about specifics, if you want to go into about Mercury\nand then maybe about Gemini. Or however you would like to do it. Whatever you\'re\ncomfortable doing. We would love to hear about it.\n\nJOHNSTON: Let me go over and look through my notes and stuff on the Mercury, Gemini and\nApollo Program, and really, Skylab. Skylab was a hell of a program. I mean, really. We\nflew guys for eighty-two days, I guess. We learned an awful lot about the medical aspects of\ngoing into space from the Skylab Program. Yes, let me think about it. I\'ll put some notes\ntogether. I\'ll come back over and talk to you.\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-20\n\nJohnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nRichard S. Johnston\n\nBERGEN: Wonderful. That ought to be great. We\'d appreciate it.\n[End of interview]\n\n11 August 1998\n\n12-21\n\n'
