Extremely high spectral purity, and short-term stability of less than 1.5 x 10 to the -13th have been achieved. A brief description on using CO2 isotope lasers as secondary frequency standards and in optical radar is given. The design and output characteristics of a single frequency, TEM00q mode, variable pulse width, hybrid TE CO2 laser system is also described. The frequency chirp in the output has been measured and almost completely eliminated by means of a novel technique.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19910056756, "endDate": "1989-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Conference", "location": "New Orleans, LA", "id": "1c35231f7f62498a86d5373f66b0ccb5", "startDate": "1989-12-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910056756, "id": "ef64c0ad52344ee89e8d5c7086a4070d", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
