b'White Paper: NASA Senior Design: Systems Engineering and Reusable Avionics\nJames M. Conrad - Fall 2009 - Spring 2010\nAbstract\nOne concept for future space flights is to construct building blocks for a wide variety of avionics\nsystems. Once a unit has served its original purpose, it can be removed from the original vehicle\nand reused in a similar or dissimilar function, depending on the function blocks the unit contains.\nFor example: Once a lunar lander has reached the moon\'s surface, an engine controller for the\nLunar Decent Module would be removed and used for a lunar rover motor control unit or for a\nEnvironmental Control Unit for a Lunar Habitat.\nThis senior design project included the investigation of a wide range of functions of space\nvehicles and possible uses. Specifically, this includes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determining and specifying the basic functioning blocks of space vehicles.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Building and demonstrating a concept model.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Showing high reliability is maintained.\n\nThe specific implementation of this senior design project included a large project team made up\nof Systems, Electrical, Computer, and Mechanical Engineers/Technologists. The efforts were\nmade up of several sub-groups that each worked on a part of the entire project. The large size\nand complexity made this project one of the more difficult to manage and advise. Typical\nprojects only have 3-4 students, but this project had 10 students from five different disciplines.\nThis paper describes the difference of this large project compared to typical projects, and the\nchallenges encountered. It also describes how the systems engineering approach was\nsuccessfully implemented so that the students were able to meet nearly all of the project\nrequirements.\nNASA Faculty Fellow Program\nIn early 2009, NASA\'s Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) solicited involvement\nfor a summer 2009 higher education opportunity for faculty. The purpose of their program was to\nprepare faculty to enable their students to complete senior design projects with the potential for\ncontribution to NASA ESMD objectives. The goal of this program was to select five faculty who\nwould work for several weeks at a NASA field center on a specific ESMD project and\nincorporate the ESMD project into an existing senior design course or capstone course at their\nuniversity in the 2009/2010 academic year. The course could have all students involved in a\nsingle project, or allow a subset of the enrolled students to work on a project.\n\nDuring the six weeks at the NASA center, faculty fellows worked closely with NASA engineers.\nThe objective of this NASA site assignment was so the faculty could gain extensive knowledge\non the specific selected NASA project, including the requirements, interfaces and issues\naffecting the design and potential solutions. During the summer the faculty also developed\nmaterials for use at their university during the academic year in support of the completion of the\nsenior design project using a systems engineering approach.\nSystems Engineeringi\nSystems engineering is a methodical, disciplined approach for the design, realization, technical\nmanagement, operations, and retirement of a system. The senior design project teams were\nencouraged to review the NASA systems engineering handbook\' in the early stages of their\nprojects. They were provided with supplemental systems engineering educational materials.\nThe senior design teams were required to focus on the following systems engineering facets and\nto control their projects:\n\n/\t\n\nSYSTEMS ENGINEERING\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 System Design\n- Requirements Definition\n-Technical Solution Definition\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Product Realization\n- Design Realization\n- Evaluation\n- Product Transition\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Technical Management\n-Technical Planning\n-Technical Control\n-Technical Assessment\n-Technical Decision Analysis\n\nPR OJECT CONTROL\t\n\n\' Planning\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Risk Management\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Configuration\nManagement\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Data Management\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Assessment\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Decision Analysis\n\n\\\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Management Planning\n.

Documentation and Data\nManagement\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Acquisition Management\ni\n\nThe system engineering design concepts crucial for project success are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Successfully understanding and defining the mission objectives and operational concepts are\nkeys to capturing the stakeholder expectations, which will translate into quality requirements\nover the life cycle of the project.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Complete and thorough requirements traceability is a critical factor in successful validation\nof requirements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Clear and unambiguous requirements will help avoid misunderstanding when developing the\noverall system and when making major or minor changes.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Document all decisions made during the development of the original design concept in the\ntechnical data package. This will make the original design philosophy and negotiation results\navailable to assess future proposed changes and modifications against.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The design solution verification occurs when an acceptable design solution has been selected\nand documented in a technical data package. The design solution is verified against the\nsystem requirements and constraints. However, the validation of a design solution is a\ncontinuing recursive and iterative process during which the design solution is evaluated\nagainst stakeholder expectations.\nThese key areas should be monitored and assessed during the design project implementation. It\nshould be noted that the UNC Charlotte Senior Design Program included many of these concepts\nin their existing program 14 \' 5 b\nNASA Reusable Avionics Project\nThe initial proposal for this activity was to develop a General Purpose Measurement Tool for use\non the lunar surface. However, the need for hardware/software for the Johnson Space Center\nElectronics (JSC-EV) branch had changed quite a bit since the original proposal was written in\nJanuary 2009. There were more immediate needs than the measurement tool (specific) that can\nhelp NASA, specifically proof-of-concept technologies (general). The general technology\nactivities could help guide the development of specific devices. Therefore, this original proposal\nwas changed.\nWith his technical manager (Greg Hall), Dr. Conrad discussed the technical areas of interest to\nJSC-EV, including wireless sensor networks, RFID sensing, system engineering, middleware\nnetworking, lunar vehicle, and measurement tools projects. There is an underlying technology\nquestion about reusing hardware between all of the lunar assets. For example, the lunar descent\nvehicle, the lunar habitat, and the lunar electric rover will all need electronic interfaces and\ncomputer controller boards. Rather than have three separate sets of electronics (and the spares\nthat might be needed), a good design would reuse the one-use only lunar descent vehicle\'s\ncomputer controller board so that it could be used in the habitat or rover. The new project\ninvestigated the feasibility of this concept.\nDr. Conrad investigated in more detail the avionics planned and already in the Constellation\nvehicles (Orion, Altair, habitat, Lunar Electric Rover). Many documents arc in the public\ndomain, but many are also contractor designs and are thus not accessible. Dr. Conrad is\ncontinued with a "generic" design of the different avionics vehicles and approximated, as best\npossible, the hardware and software design. An additional area of investigation was Real-time\nEthernet, or Time-triggered Ethernet.\nOne concept for future space flights is to construct building blocks for a wide variety of avionics\nsystems. Once a unit has served its original purpose, it can be removed from the original vehicle\nand reused in a similar or dissimilar function, depending on the function blocks the unit contains.\n\nFor example: Once a lunar lander has reached the moon\'s surface, an engine controller for the\nLunar Decent Module would be removed and used for a lunar rover motor control unit or for a\nEnvironmental Control Unit for a Lunar Hab.\nThis final identified project was to include the investigation of a wide range of functions of space\nvehicles and possible uses. Specifically, this included:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determining and specifying the basic functioning blocks of space vehicles.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Building and demonstrating a concept model.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Showing high reliability is maintained.\n\nThe specific implementation of this project will required a large project team made up of\nSystems, Electrical, Computer, and Mechanical Engineers/Technologists. The efforts were to be\nmade up of several sub-groups that each worked on a part of the entire project.\nGeneral support (4): Systems\nEngineering, FPGA Engineer/\nTechnologist, FPAA Engineer/\nMechanical\nTechnologist,\t\nEngineer/ Technologist\n\nSystems Engineer\n\nMechanical\nEngineorf\nTechnologist\n\nTeam Load\nRobotics\n(Sfwr or Hdwr Eng)\n\nSoftware or\nHardware\nEngineer\n\nFPAA\nEngineer/\nTechnologist\n\nTeam Lead\nHabitat\n(Sfwr or Hdwr Eng)\n\nSoftware or\nHardware\nEngineer\n\nFPGA\nEngineod\nTechnologist\n\nTeam Lead\nSpace Vohlclo\n(Sfwr or Hdwr Eng)\n\nSoftware or\nHardware\nEngineer\n\nProject 1 (2-3):\t Robotic Sensing,\nControl, and Communications\nLunar Habitat\nProject 2 (2-3):\t\nControl,\t\nand\nSensing,\t\nCommunications\nProject 3 (2-3):\t\nSpace Vehicle\nControl,\t\nand\nSensing,\t\nCommunications\nFPGA = Field Programmable Gate\nArray, FPAA = Field Programmable\nAnalog Array\n\nThis was one of the most complex projects offered by the University of North Carolina at\nCharlotte for the senior design program. Students working on this project were be given the\nexperience of working on a typical industry effort, with respect to size and scope.\nThe project had four subprojects. The main objective was to demonstrate that the same FPGA\nand FPAA board can be moved between three different systems. Each of the Systems were to\nhave some basic functionality, i.e. the Robotic Vehicle could move in its environment and avoid\nobstacles. There were to be four deliverable products from this project:\n\n\t\n\n1. A robotic vehicle that uses the common FPGA and FPAA boards\n2. A simulated lunar habitat that uses the common FPGA and FPAA boards\n3. A simulated space vehicle that uses the common FPGA and FPAA boards\n4. A programming and test fixture for the FPGA and FPAA boards\nResults - Student Involvement\nThis project was implemented in the UNC Charlotte College of Engineering Industrial Senior\nDesign Course. It was offered as one of several projects that students could choose to work on\nover the course of the fall 2009 and spring 2010 semesters.\nStudents were invited to apply to participate in this project before fall courses even started. The\nobjective of this early advertising was to ensure enough students would select this project as their\nfirst choice. Apparently our advertising approach and the allure of working on a NASA project\nwas VERY successful. Twenty-five students applied early for the ten project positions,\nincluding four for the coveted Systems Engineer position. One half of the students were\nencouraged to apply for the project on selection day (two weeks into the course). Sixteen\napplications were submitted on selection day, and ten were assigned to the project. Several\nstudents were turned away so that they could work on other industry projects.\nOne of the first things that the team did was to organize themselves into different teams than had\nbeen initially formulated by the faculty advisor. This was necessary since three fewer electrical\nand computer engineering students were allocated to the project as first proposed. The final\nassigned number of students also necessitated that the "deliverables" be reduced to three - the\nsimulated space vehicle was removed from the requirements.\n\nSystems\nEngineer\nJett R\n\nFPGA/FPAA\nTeam Lead:\n\n\t\n\nSean H\n\nabitat\n\t\n\nSteve C\nPhu P\nSteohen P\n\nTeam lead:\n\nMechanical\n\t\n\nGary G\n\nCharles P\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nvenlcle\nJacob S\nCurtis A\nAndrew H\n\nTears Leid:\n\nThe student selected as the Systems Engineer has an extensive background in industry and had a\nstrong interest in project management.\nResults - Project Implementation\nStudents who were selected for this project completed the requirements document, built a work\nbreakdown structure of the effort, planned the project activities and designed the devices and\nvehicles in the fall, as described in the UNC Charlotte Senior Design publications"""\'. Students\nimplemented the designs in the spring semester (which was not complete at the time of\npublication of this paper). The Faculty Advisor, Dr. Conrad, worked closely with all team\nmembers to ensure success.\nDue to the size of team, it was necessary for the sub-teams to have separate meetings, with an\noccasional "all-hands meeting" of the entire team when needed. The Systems Engineer and\nTeam Leads also meet with the faculty advisor on a regular basis. The team leads were\nresponsible for gathering all requirements and designs for their sub-project, then forwarding\nthese requirements and designs to the Systems Engineer. Any technology interfaces between\nteams were directly handled by team members - they did not go through the team leads for such\ndetailed efforts.\nThe team had the same problems and successes that typical large industry teams encounter,\nincluding the well know forming-storming-norming-performing team behavior. All storming\nbehavior was resolved by the end of the first semester.\nThis team, using Systems Engineering approaches at a more pronounced level than other senior\ndesign teams, was able to outperform nearly all other teams in first semester performance.\nReferences\n1.\n\nGhanashyam Joshi, Jiang Guo, James Conrad, Alak Bandyopadhyay, William M.

Students\nworking on this project will be given the experience of working on a typical industry effort, with\nrespect to size and scope. The Faculty Advisor, Dr. Conrad, will work closely with all team\nmembers to ensure success. Students who participate in this project will also be co-authors on\nseveral technical papers which will be written to describe the effort and results. This effort will\ntruly be a bright spot on anyone\'s resume.\nStudents working on this project will have the opportunity to work at NASA\'s Johnson Space\nCenter as an intern in the summer of 2010. Interested students will need to apply for the\ninternship in the fall of 2009. Summer employment is not guaranteed, but working on this\nproject will provide proof of a strong commitment to NASA\'s goals.\n\nExpectations of Students\nIt is expected that any skills not yet learned but required for the job will be either taken as a\ncourse during the first semester of this project, or will be learned on the students own time. In\nany case, the student must have a "Practitioner" level of knowledge by December.\nThe entire project team will meet once a week to report progress. Other one-on-one meetings\nwill be needed to discuss and work on technical matters. Students are encouraged to seek\n\nassistance if technology poses a specific problem. Nonetheless, this is NOT a project for\nstudents who expect to coast during their project. You will work, but not for excessive amounts\nof time. It is expected that student effort will be consistent during the semesters and not with a\nlarge peak at the end of the semesters.\n\nJob Descriptions\nEach position below lists certain skills needed for the project.
