Consideration is given to the importance of workload for safety, crew size, automation, and certification; the definition and measurement of workload, physical vs mental workloads, subjective ratings, secondary tasks, biocybernetic measures, and attention and workload. Recent studies of pilot and ATC workloads are reviewed, and typical data are presented in graphs. Future trends are discussed, and it is predicted that increased cockpit automation will eventually require new methods to maintain operator attention rather than reduce workload.", "title": "Human workload in aviation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T01:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890047066, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kantowitz, Barry H."}, "organization": {"name": "Battelle Memorial Institute", "location": "Seattle, WA, United States"}}, "id": "6c848df493884a6d98f1f031e90e8d48"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19890047066, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Casper, Patricia A."}, "organization": {"name": "Purdue University", "location": "West Lafayette, IN, United States"}}, "id": "02fe5c49381d4707b88ea3620bcc7063"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890047066, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890047066, "id": "7f428d43723644489c84981735f5f38b", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
