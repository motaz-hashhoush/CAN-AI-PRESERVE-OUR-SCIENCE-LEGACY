In structures the ad hoc compatibility conditions through virtual \"cuts\" and closing \"gaps\" are not parallel to the strain formulation in elasticity. This deficiency in the compatibility conditions has prevented the development of a direct stress determination method in structures and in elasticity. We have addressed this deficiency and attempted to unify the theory of compatibility. This work has led to the development of the integrated force method for structures and the completed Beltrami-Michell formulation for elasticity. The improved accuracy observed in the solution of numerical examples by the integrated force method can be attributed to the compliance of the compatibility conditions. Using the compatibility conditions allows mapping of variables and facile movement among different structural analysis formulations. This paper reviews and illustrates the requirement of compatibility in structures and in elasticity. It also describes the generation of the conditions and quantifies the benefits of their use. The traditional analysis methods and available solutions (which have been obtained bypassing the missed conditions) should be verified for compliance of the compatibility conditions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000000252, "id": "db214968bb5f41348fb4e8acfaa9ad69", "publicationDate": "1999-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000000252.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000000252/downloads/20000000252.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000000252/downloads/20000000252.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000000252/downloads/20000000252.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
