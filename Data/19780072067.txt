Studies\nwill range from planets in our own solar s ystem to some of\nthe most distant objects in the universe, including quasars,\npulsars and black holes in space.\n\nIUE will be examining the spectral region which lies\nin the ultraviolet (UV) between 1150 Angstroms and 3200\nAngstroms, a region inaccessible from the ground. This\nregion includes the fundamental emissions of many of the\ncommon elements in the universe (hydrogen, helium, carbon,\nnitrogen, oxygen).\n\nData returned by IUE are expected to shed more light\non the nature of the different kinds of stars that populate\nour galaxy; on the material between the stars from which\nstars are formed; on many of the objects that are emitting\nradio waves or x-rays; and on nearby galaxies such as the\nlittle-understood Seyfert galaxies (see glossary).\n\nQuasars are among the most puzzling objects in the\nuniverse. They are estimated to be less than 10 light years\nin diameter, compared with the 100,000-light-year diameter\nof a typical galaxy of 100 billion stars; yet, quasars pour\nout ba times more ener9y.\n-more-\n\nThey are the most powerful emitters of energy known.\nHow this enormous energy is generated is a mystery. There\nis no known physical process to account for it.\n\nIt is expected that new knowledge may be obtained by\nexamining in detail relatively nearby quasars in the ultraviolet, and then comparing these data with those from the\nmore distant quasars seen by ground observatories in visible\nlight.\n\nIn our own galaxy, the spacecraft will look at hot\nstars and the outer atmospheres of "cool" stars. Cool\nstars are Etars similar to our own Sun. They are relatively\ncool at their surfaces but have extremely rarefied outer\natmospheres, or coronas, with temperatures of about 555,000\ndegrees Celsius Cone million degrees Fahrenheit). Ground\nobservatories can\'t study these coronas effectively, but IUE\ninstrumentation will be able to examine them to determine\ntheir temperatures, density and chemical composition. The\nworkings of our own Sun are expected to be better understood\nas a result of these investigations.\n\nThe interstellar medium of our galaxy and even the\nplanets of our own solar system will also come in for\nintensive study.\n-more-\n\n-4-.\nThe gas and dust of the interstellar medium are\nbelieved to be the product of exploding stars and the\nmaterial out of which new stars are born. Scientists\nare interested in the composition of the "grains t\' floating\nin the space between the stars to learn more about them\nand how our own star was born.\n\nAnother target of IUE will be Jupiter and other planets\nin the solar system. Even though we have taken closeup\npictures of the planets and some of their moons, we have\nlittle information concerning their emissions in the ultraviolet. Jupiter\'s giant red spot is of special interest,\nalong with the four larger Jovian moons, 10, Europa, Ganymede\nand Callisto, and their atmospheres.\n\nIUE will complement and extend observations made by\nthe two NASA Orbiting Astronomical Observatories, OAO-2 and\nCopernicus, and ESA\'s TD-1 satellite. IUE will be followed\nby the 10-ton Space Telescope (ST) which will be launched\nby the Space Shuttle in 1983.\n\nIUE will provide a rehearsal for one of the most important objectives of the ST -- a system for observing by\nastronomers of all nations.\n\n-more-\n\n-5The first facilities for such observations have been\nestablished for IUE by NASA at the Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, Greenbelt, Md., and by ESA near Madrid, Spain.\n\nWith very little spacecraft operations background,\nastronomers from different countries will be able to use\nthe IUE observatories without undergoing tedious training\ncourses in specialized techniques, will be able to go into\nthe IUE Scientific Control Center at Goddard, for example,\nidentify their targets and begin collecting data much as\nthey would in a ground-based observatory.\n\nBecause of IUE\'s geosynchronous orbit, the astronomers\nwill be able to observe a wide variety of objects repeatedly\nover long periods of time. Repetition of observations using\nground-based equipment has demonstrated that the spectra of\nmany stars vary with time.\n\nThe spacecraft is an octagonal structure with the\ntelescope protruding from the top and a fixed solar array\non two opposite sides. The spacecraft, when stabilized, is\ndesigned to always maintain one side of the two arrays\ntoward the Sun.\n\n-more-\n\n-6Spacecraft structure is of a modular design, allowing\neasy installation or removal of its various assemblies and\ncomponents. Total weight is 671 kilograms (1,479 pounds)\nincluding the apogee boost motor. It stands 4.3 meters\n(14 feet) tall and is 1.3 m (4.3 ft.,) in diameter at launch.\nWhen the solar arrays are unfolded in space, it is 4.3 in\n(14 ft.) wide. An apogee boost motor propellant places the\nspacecraft in its eccentric synchronous Earth orbit, 46,000\nkm (28,800 mi.) by 25,000 km (15,700 mi.).\n\nAt that altitude, the spacecraft will appear to drift\nback and forth over the equator during its expected threeyear lifetime, ranging to about 29 degrees North and South\nlatitudes. It will be in constant view from the Goddard\nstation and in view at least 10 hours a day from the Madrid\nstation. Onboard, hydrazine gasjjets will keep the spacecraft\non station with a mean longitude of 71 degrees West.\n\nThe Goddard Space Flight Center is responsible for the\ndesign, integration and testing of IUE, and provides the\nU.S. ground support facilities. ESA built the solar array\nand the Madrid ground facilities. Britain\'s SRC, in collaboration with University College, London, provided the\nfour television camera detectors for transforming the spectral\ndisplays into video signals for transmission to the ground.\n\n-7In accordance with agreements among the three participating agencies, viewing time will be allocated on a\none-third, two-thirds basis. NASA will have 16 hours of\nviewing time and then will turn over the spacecraft to ESA\nfor an eight-hour viewing block which will be shared equally\nby ESA and the United Kingdom.\n\nGoddard manages the Delta rocket program for NASA.\nMcDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., Huntington Beach, Calif.,\nis the prime contractor.\n\n(END OF GENERAL RELEASE. BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOLLOWS.).\n\n-more\'-\n\nTHE SPACECRAFT\nThe IUE is an octagonal structure with the telescope\nprotruding from the top and a fixed solar array on two\nopposite sides. It is designed to maintain one face of\nthe array toward the Sun when stabilized. Thermal control is provided by a set of thermal louvers on the dark\nside of the spacecraft which regulate the heat loss to\nspace.\nMost of the electronic equipment is mounted on a honeycomb platform adjacent to the louvers where the temperature\nwill be maintained between 0 degrees and 40 degrees C. A\nsolid propellant kick motor is used to accelerate the spacecraft to near synchronous velocity at the apogee of the transfer orbit. An auxiliary propulsion system utilizing hydrazine\nmonopropellant occupies the lower portion of the octagonal\nbody. The hydrazine auxiliary propulsion system (RAPS) will\nprovide active nutation control, attitude control, spin-despin\nfunctions, east-west station keeping, momentum unloading and\ntrajectory error correction.\n\nThe spacecraft structure is of modular design allowing\neasy installation or removal of its various assemblies or\nthe components that it supports. The primary structural\nelements are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Strong Ring\n\xe2\x80\xa2 IRA Frame\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Upper Body Structure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Main Platform\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Upper Cone Structure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Propulsion Bay Structure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ap oq ee Motor Ada p ter Rinq\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lower Cofle Structure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Upper Platforms\n-more-\n\n-9-\n\nSOLAR ARRAY\nINST RUM ( NT\n\nASSY\n\nNM\n\nPC TU RE\n\nDL PLO\n\n)LJVE RS\n\nIFORM\n\nCTURE\n\nTANKS\n)N BAY\n\nRUST ER\nO1OR\nRING\n\nTUR(\n\nExploded View of Spacecraft.\n-more-\n\n-10Poer\nThe power system is a direct energy transfer (DET)\nsystem by which power from the solar array is transferred\ndirectly to the spacecraft bus at near 100 per cent\nefficiency. Elipse power and daytime power exceeding the\nsolar array output are obtained from two nickel-cadmium\nbatteries through a boost regulator operating at 90\nper cent minimum efficiency. A control unit monitors\nthe spacecraft bus voltage and generates signals to\ndrive the solar array shunt regulator, battery charge\ncontroller, and battery discharge regulator in the proper\nsequence such that the spacecraft power system is operated\nat maximum efficiency during all modes of operation.\nCommunications\nThe communication system transmits telemetry data,\nreceives ground generated commands, and provides range and\nrange rate (R&RR) measurement capability for orbit determination. This system consists of redundant S-Band transmitters with four selectable power amrlifiers, four S-Band\nantennas, redundant VHF transponders, and a four-element\nVHF antenna system.\nCommand System\nThe command system consists of a pair of redundant\ncommand decoders and a command relay unit. Ground commands\ncan be processed by either decoder through the VHF receiver\nsystem. Additionally, all commands can be issued by the\nonboard computer (OBC) and processed with either decoder.\nCommand conflict or priority establishment between ground\ngenerated or computer generated commands will be avoided\nby use of time-shared control of the decoder execution\nlogic.\nScientific Instrument Systems\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reflecting telescope for gathering light from\ncelestial objects.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Echelle spectrograph for forming the ultraviolet\nlight into spectral displays.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Television camera detectors for transforming the\nspectral displays into video signals suitable for\ntelemetering.\n- more -\n\n-11-\n\nTelescope\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\nThe telescope is a 45 cm (17.5 in.) diameter f/15\nCassegrain design, the function of which is to collect optical radiation from astonomical sources and present it to\nthe spectrographs. The telescope will provide point-source\nimages of about 1 arc-sec on-axis at its focal plane. The\nuseful field of view of the telescope, 16 minutes of arc\nin diameter, is used to identify the desired target\nstar for fine pointing.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Clear aperture\n\n45 cm (17.5 in.) diameter\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Length\n\n130 cm (46 in.)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Effective focal length\n\n675 cm (263 in.)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Effective focal ratio\n\nf/i 5\n\nSpe ctrographs\nLight from the telescope may be directed into either\nof two spectrographs which are able to analyze ultraviolet\nradiation with a resolution about 0.lA. The short wavelength spectrograph is a three element Echelle system,\ncontaining an off-axis paraboloid as collimator, an Echelle\ngrating, and a spherical first order grating that is used to\nseparate the Echelle orders and to focus the resulting\nspectral display on the television camera. The long wavelength spectograph is identical, except that two 45 degree\nflats are inserted to shift the light rays diverging from\nthe entrance aperture so that they will not interfere with\nthe rays falling on the short wavelength collimator. Either\nspectrograph may be converted to a low dispersion instrument\nby inserting a flat in front of the . Echelle grating so that\nthe only dispersion is provided by the spherical grating.\nTarget Acquisition and Fine Error Sensing\nTwo redundant\nmode operation, ac\ntarget recognition\nfor pointing error\nvides the observer\nimage is displayed\nguide star and the\n\nfine error sensors, each capable of multicomplish the dual role of a field camera,\nand acquisition, and of an error sensor\ngeneration. The field camera mode prowith an image of the star field. This\non the ground in real time so that a\ntarget star can be identified.\n- "or -\n\n-12-\n\nThe Fine Error Sensor is then commanded to track the\nguide star and provide offset data so that the target star\ncan be placed in the spectrograph aperture by the control\nsystem.\nUV Spectrum Detectors\nEach of the two spectrographs incorporates two tillsensitive television cameras which are used respectively as\nprime and back-up spectrum detectors, either camera being\nselectable on command.\nThe uV spectrum, which the spectrograph optics focuses\nat the faceplate of the selected camera, is converted in wavelength to visible light and, at the same time, increased in\nlight intensity, by means of a proximity focused wavelength\nconverterdiode.. The .fiberoptic output .window.of..this.. converter\nis optically coupled to the fIberoptic input window of a\nlight-sensitive secondary emission conduction (SEC) vIdIcon\ntube. In a manner analogous to a photographic emulsion, the\ntarget of the SEC tube can "accumulate" an image of the spectrum. The exposure time can be varied to suit the intensity\nof the spectral features of the target star -- for a faint\nstar, exposures up to a few hours may be required. When the\nexposure is terminated, the integrated image is "read out."\nUnlike normal broadcast TV cameras, the IUE cameras are\noperated in a digital (rather than analog) mode, using a 256\nlevel gray scale, permitting accurate measurement of intensity\nof each of more than 1/2 million picture elements. Following\nread-out, the video data are transmitted to ground where they\nprocessed by computer using image processing software jointly\nproduced by the U.K. and Goddard Center. This software is an\nadvanced development of NASA\'s JPL VICAR computer program and\nthe IUE software enables correction of effects such as photocathode and target non-uniformities and geometric distortions\nwhich are inherent in the SEC tubes. This software also permits the image, either "raw" as seen by the camera, or corrected to be reconstituted in the form of a "photograph" or\nto be plotted in terms of intensity as a function of wavelength.\nDevelopment and space qualification of the camera system\ninvolved U.K. and U.S. industry in the solution of a number of\ndifficult technological problems which included production of\nlight-weight, low-volume, high-stability, high-voltage supplies\nwith output commandable up to 14KV and the development of extremely high quality UV-to-visible converters.\n\n-more-\n\n-13-\n\nThe rrna 1\nThe thermal system is designed to maintain proper\ntemperature control of all onboard systems in sunlight for all\nsolar aspect angles of from 00 (Sun on aft end of spacecraft)\nto 135\xc2\xb0 in the X-Z plane, and to withstand eclipse periods\nup to 74 minutes. To achieve the desired temperature control the thermal design employs a combination of passive\nand active thermal control. Three sets of thermal louvers\nlocated on the anti-sun side of the middle portion of the\nstructure provide active thermal control for most onboard\nsubsystems. These louvers are supplemented with black\npassive radiators. The remaining portions of the spacecraft surfaces are covered with a combination of multilayer insulation and special thermal coatings. Circular\nheat pipes mounted concentrically to the bottom of the main\nequipment shelf will minimize thermal gradients.\n\n-more-\n\n-14-\n\nGROUND SYSTEM\nThe spacecraft and ground system together comprise an\nobservatory, the facilities of which--both orbiting and on\nthe ground--will be made available to selected guest\nobservers. Most of these observers will need to have\nonly a limited, superficial knowledge of the technical\ndetails and use of software systems for processing of\nscientific data. Instead, as astronomers, they will\nuse the observatory in much the same manner as they\nwould use, for example, Palomar or Lick Observatories.\nBecause the IUE spacecraft will be in a synchronous\norbit, it will be in continuous contact with the ground\nsystems and, therefore, the ground system can be designed\nto function much like a typical ground-based observatory.\nResident astronomers and other trained personnel will\nassist the observer with all aspects of his observing\nprogram. The guest observer will leave the facility with\nfinal processed data in a form suitable for detailed\ninterpretation and analysis.\nMission Operations\nOrbiting with a geosynchronous period at a mean\nlongitude of 71 degrees W., the spacecraft will be in\ncontinuous contact with the U.S. ground observatory. A\nsecond site--the European ground observatory Madrid,\noperated by ESA--will be capable of viewing the spacecraft\nfor extended periods of at least 10 hours each day. In\naccordance with the international agreements, NASA will\nconduct observations for 16 hours per day and the\nEuropean ground observatory will conduct 10 hours of\nobservations per day on the average. Health and safety\nof the spacecraft is the responsibility of NASA and will\nbe monitored from Goddard Center 24 hours per day.\nBecause the total IUE system is conceived to\nfunctionally resemble a typical ground-based astronomical\nobservatory with operations conducted in real time 24\nhours per day, a unique dedicated ground system is an\nintegral part of the total system. The IUE includes both\nthe IUE flight system and the IUE ground system. The IUE\nGround System is defined to include both a U.S. ground\nobservatory and a European ground observatory. The U.S.\ng round observatory includes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ground station (This is the dedicated IUE\ntelemetry/command station at the Goddard Center\nNetwork Test and Training Facility.)\n- more -\n\n-15-\n\nS Scientific Operations Center,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Operation Control Center\nTwo Xerox Data Systems (XDS) "Sigma Series" computers\nwill be used to support all functions of the U.S. ground\nobservatory. One, a Sigma 5 will support real-time command\nand control of the spacecraft and real-time image display\nfor the observing programs. The second, a Sigma 9 will\nfulfill two roles: that of backup to the Sigma 5 on an\n"as needed" basis and as the central computer for "near\nreal-time" image processing. Physically, both will be\nlocated within the 0CC. Remote terminals to the SOC are\nprovided.\nScientific Operations Center (SOC)\nHere, the planning, administrative, and management\naspects of the observatory will be conducted. Space for\nresid\xc3\xa8\xc3\xb1t astronomers and guest observers is provided.\nRouting real time observing programs will be conducted\nfrom the Telescope Observing Center (TOC) within this\nfacility. Image processing will be performed by the\nImage Processing Center (IPC), also within this facility,\nby means of communication lines to/from the Sigma 9\ncomputer located in the 0CC.\nOperations Control Center (0CC)\nThe 0CC is the nerve center of the observatory\nBoth computers are installed here. Either can process\ndata, format command sequences, and generate real time\ndisplays of images in support of the real time operations\nconducted in the Mission Control Room (MCR), also a\npart of the 0CC.\nIn the MCR, spacecraft controllers will monitor the\nstatus of the spacecraft and its subsystems, initial\ncheckout of the scientific instrument as well as special\nobserving programs will be performed from the MCR. The\nMCR will "hand off" the spacecraft to the European Ground\nobservatory, and during the eighthour ESA/SRC period of\ncontrol and observing, will maintain a monitoring and\nstandby control capability should the need arise.\n\n- more -\n\n-16-\n\nIUE SPACECRAFT\n\n1\n\n/\n\nNETWORK TEST\r\n& TRAINING\r\nFACILITY\nU.S. GROUND OBSERVATORY\nGSFC.

Main differences\nstem from the fact that in the ESA case the IUE operations\nare conducted from a single building where the 0CC and\nSoc are located side by side. Another important difference\nis that a single Sigma 9 computer is used. For eight hours\na day it will be dedicated to spacecraft control while for\nthe remaining time it will be devoted to image processing\nactivities.\nGuest Observers\nThe IUE is an international facility which is\nopen to both U.S. and foreign guest observers. U.S.-based\nguest observers will come to Goddard Center and perform\ntheir programs at the IUE Scientific Operations Center\nwhich will accommodate six to eight guest observers at\none time. It is anticipated that a typical visit will\nlast about one week and that each astronomer will have\none or two observing sessions per day. At the conclusion of\nthis visit the guest observer will have all of his data\nin final reduced form. Observational data will be made\navailable to the National Space Science Data Center at\nGoddard after the observer has had an appropriate time\nfor analysis and interpretation. The ESA ground observatory\nis similarly an international facility where guest\nastronomers from the ESA member states plus other European\nand non-European countries will conduct their observations.\nDELTA LAUNCH VEHICLE\nDelta 138 with its IUE spacecraft payload will be\nlaunched from Pad A, northernmost of the two launch pads\nat Complex 17, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla.\nThe second stage of Delta 138 arrived at Cape Canaveral\nAir Force Station in September 1977. The first stage and\ninterstage arrived in November 1977.\nThe Delta first stage and interstage were erected on\nPad A Nov. 29. The nine solid strap-on rocket motors were\nmounted in place around the base of the first stage Nov. 30.\nThe second stage was erected Dec. 1.\nThe IUE spacecraft was received by the Kennedy Space \r\nCenter Dec. 20 and underwent initial processing in Hangar AE.\nIt was moved to Explosive Safe Area 60 Jan. 12 for\nfuel loading and apogee boost motor installation. The\nspacecraft was mated with the Delta third stage Jan. 18.\n- more -\n\n\', 8\nThe third stage spacecraft assembly was moved to\nPad A and mated with Delta 138 Jan. 19. The payload\nfairing, to protect the spacecraft on its flight through\nthe atmosphere, will be put in place Jan. 24.\nAll launch vehicle and pad operations during the\nlaunch countdown are conducted from the blockhouse at\nComplex 17 by a joint government-industry team.\nFirst Stage\nThe first stage is a McDonnell Douglas modified Thor\nbooster incorporating nine Castor II strap-on Thiokol\nsolid fuel rocket motors. The booster is powered by a\nRocketdyne engine using liquid oxygen and liquid\nhydrocarbon propellants. The main engine is gimbal-mounted\nto provide pitch and yaw control from liftoff to main\nengine cutoff (IvIECO).\nSecond Stage\nThe second stage is powered by the TRW-built TR2O1\nliquid fuel, pressure fed engine that also is gimbal\nmounted to provide pitch and yaw control during powered\nflight. A cold gas system provides pitch, yaw and roll\ncontrol during coast and after second stage cutoffs. The\nengine is capable of multiple restarts. The second stage\nalso houses the Delta inertial guidance system which\nprovides guidance control and sequencing of the vehicle\nfrom liftoff through third stage spinup.\nThird Stage\nThe third stage is the Thiokol TE-364-4 spin stabilized\nsolid propellant Thiokol motor. It is secured in the spin\ntable mounted to the second stage. The firing of the eight\nsolid propellant rockets fixed to the spin table accomplishes\nspinup of the third stage spacecraft assembly.\nIniection Into Transfer Orbit\nThe Delta vehicle will inject IUE into a transfer\norbit having an apogee of 46,342 km (28,784 ml.) a perigee\nof 167 km (104 mi.) and an inclination of 28.7 degrees.\nNASA\'s Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network will provide\ntelemetry, tracking and ranging support until the spacecraft\nis placed in its final synchronous orbit.\n- more -\n\n-19-\n\nIUE LAUNCH PROFILE\nThe first two stages of the Delta 2914 place the\nspacecraft into a low altitude parking orbit 167 km\n(104 mi.) near the first equatorial crossings. Spinup\nto 60 rpm, followed by injection into a transfer orbit\nusing the Delta third stage, occurs after approximately\n30 minutes in parking orbit.\nFollowing burnout of the Delta third stage and\nspacecraft separation, IUE will be in transfer orbit.\nIpogee Boost Motor\nAt apogee, the motor is commanded to ignite by\nground command from Goddard Center. A backup command\nsequence is provided by the onboard computer to perform\nthe burn sequence if something should happen to the\nground command link. With an ABM firing at apogee,\nthe spacecraft will be placed at the desired station\npoint, a geographic longitude of the ascending node\nof 44 degrees west, and the orbit will be targeted\nfor zero drift. If some drift does occur, the hydrazine\npropulsion system will be used to place the spacecraft\n"on station."\n\n- more -\n\n\t\n\n-20-\n\ni-i N\t\n\n.-..\t\n\nm\t\n\nN aD\n\'\t\n\'\t\n\n\xc2\xbcD\t\nU)\n\nLI) N H LI)\r\n(\'fl\t\ni-I\t\n\'\nC\t\nC)\n\'\t\n-\t\n-\n\nN\t\nO\t\nOD N\t\nN\t\n\'..P\t\n\nH N N -\t \'\n-\t\n-\t\n\nC\t\nH\t\n\nH\n\nH H N\n\nCO\t\nN\t\n\nC\'\n\nN\nN\n\nN\n\no\t\n\n-\t\n>1 I\t\n\n\'J\'\t\n\n\'\n\no\'\t\n\no\n\nC\n\nU)\n\nN\nC\n\no\nOD\n\nN\na\n\nH\n\nN\n\nU)\n\nU)\n\n.j\n\n\'\n\nLI)\n\nU)\n\nU)\n\nU)\n\nU)\n\nU)\n\nU)\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n)\n\nN\n\n\'t\'\n\nLI)\nO\n\n\'\n\nN\n\nN\n\n\'.C)\n\n(fl\n\nU)\n0)\n-\n\nLI)\n\n0)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nN\n\nN\n\ncfl\nN\n\nco\n\nN\n\n4-)\n0\n0\n\n(Y)\n\ncL\n\nH\n\nLI)\n\ntr,\n\nH\na)\n\nit,\n\nH\n\n\'.D\n\nIf)\n\nW\nC\'\n\nN\n\nco\n\n-\n\nN\nr-1\n\nN\n\nC\n\n-\n\nN\nH\n\nU)\n\nD\n\nU)\n\nC\'\n-\n\nN\n,-1\n\nV\n-\n\nN\nH\n\n\xc2\xbcC\n\n-\n\n-\n\nN\n\nN\n\nH\n\nH\n\nI!)\n0)\n\n-\n\nN\n\nH\n\n-\n\nN\n\nH\n\ni-I\n\nN\n\n(N\n\nN\n\nH\nN\n\n0)\t\n\nH\n\nH\n\nN\n\nC\'\n\nLI)\n\nU)\n\nN N C CD c\t\nN\t\n\'o\t\n\'\nC \xc2\xbcL m U) C\' N \'D N N N N N N C)\nN (N 0) 0) H H i-4 i\xe2\x80\x94I H H H H H N\n\nH\n\n(N\n\nU)\n)-1\na)\n.4)\n\na)\n\nE\n\'H\n.;)\n\nU)\n\nH Ha)\n\t\n0\n\n\'H\nz\n\nLI) LI)\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\nC)\n\nN\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nN\n\n(N\n\n\'\n\nCO H (fl\n\n(I) C) H H LI) C) \\\t\n\nIII\nC)\nz\n\nN N\t\n\nD IC, N C) N\n\nU) CD C C\' C\' C) C\' C\' N\nN H H H H H r-4 H iH\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\nI\t\n0\t\nC.)\t\n0\t\n0\t\n0\t\no o 0 0 0 0 0 (I) a) a) U) 0 a)\nU)\t\n0)\t\nU)\t\nU)\t\nU)\t\na)\t\nCI)\t\n(1)\t\na)\t\nU)\t\na)\t\nCI)\t\na)\t\n\n0\n\nU)\t\n\nU)\n\nCl)\t\n\nN N\n\nH\t\n\nU\nz\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\no\t\n\nC.L\t\nCI)\t\n\nN\t\n\n.\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nCl)\t\n\n(N\n\'\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nU)\t\n\nCl)\t\n\nU)\t\n\nCl)\t\n\nC) U) () N\n\'\t\n\nLI)\t\n\nC\')\t\n\n\'\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nI\n\na)\t\n\nU)\nN\n\nC\'\n\nH C\')\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r-\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r-I\t\n\nC N\t\nN\n\nN\n\n\'H\t\n\n-1\t\n\nC\')\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r-J\t\n\n0\r\na)\n\nU)\n\nN C)\ni\' LI)\n\n\'H\t\n\n-H\n\na)\n\n-I\n\nH\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\t\n\n4)\t\n\n-\t\no 4)\t\ni\t\nr4\t\n0\t\n0\t\n4i 4) 0 U) U\n\n-H\t\n\nI-i\t\n\no\t\n\n-i\t\n\n\xc3\xa7\t\n\nH\t\nI-i\t\no o\t\n4\t\n\n.l\t\no\t\n\n4.)\no\t\n\n4-)\t\n0\t\n\n4.)\t\n0\n\nZ Z\n\n-i\t\n0\t\n\na)\n\n4-4\t\n<\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2H -H\t\nU)\t\ne-\t\n\na)\t\n\na)\t\n\n0\n\n4.)\t\n\nU)\t\n\na)\t\n-H\t\nb\t\n\n4)\n\nU\t\nCl)\n\nCI)\t\n\nH\t\na)\t\n\n(U\t\n\n4)\t\n\n)-4\t\nC\t\n\nC\t\nH\t\n\n-H\t\n-4\t\n(U -H\t\n\nE\t\n\nE-\t\n\nZ\t\n\nZ\t\n\n0\t\n\nU)\t\n\n\'-I\t\n\n4.)\t\n\nCI)\t\n\n0\t\n\n0\t\nCI)\t\n\nU)\t\n\n4.)\t\nU)\t\n\n4-I\t\n\na)\t\n\nP\t\n\nb\n\nH\t\nH\t\n\n(U\t\n\n4)\t\nU)\t\n\na)\t\n\nt7\t\n\n4-I\n\n(U\t\n\n4-\t\nCl)\t\n\n0\t\n\xe2\x80\xa21.)\t\n\nU\n\n4- U\n\na)\n(I)\t\n\n0\n\n(U\t\n4.)\t\n\n\'-I\t\n\n$-1\t\n\n4.)\t\nU)\t\n\n4\t\n-H\t\n\nU)\t\n\n(U\n\na)\n\n\xc3\xa7\t\n\na)\t\n\nQ\t\n-H\t\n4.)\t\n\n(U\n\n- \'-1\t\n\nO.\t\n\n)\t\n\n4.)\t\n-d\t\nQ U)\t\nU)\t\n\n4-I\t\n\n-1-)\t\n\n-4.)\t\n\n-H\t\n\n-P\t\n\n-1\t\nC\t\n\na)\t\n(U\n\n)\t\n\na) U)\t\nU)\t\n\nU)\t\n\nH\t\nH\t\n\nr4\t\n\n(U\t\n\n0\t\n0\t\n\nH\t\nH\t\n\n0\t\n\n-H\t\n4-\t\n\n4.)\t\nr7j\t\n\n(U\n\n-\t\n\nrj\n\nC\t\n\n0\n(U\n\n(U\t\n\nCl)\t\n\n0 U\t\n\n-H -H \' j\t\nH\t\nH\t\n-\t\n-H\t\n0 H\t\n0\t\n4-I H U) U) 0\t\n(4-4\t\nC/)\t\n0\t\nU)\t\nCI)\t\na)\t\no\t\n4.)\t\n\n4-i\t\n4-4\t\n\n4.)\t\n\nZ\t\n\n4-)\n\nU\t\nC))\t\n\n(1)\t\n4-\t\n4) \'-\' U)\t\n\nU)\t\n\nI\t\n0\n\n(U\t\n\n-H\n\nI-)\t\n\nN\n\nI\t\n0\t\n\no\t\n\na)\nb\t\n\n(U\t\n\n(U\t\n\nU)\t\n\n(I)\no\n(U\n\na)\t\nb\t\n\n4.)

For\ngeosynchronous orbit operations, Goddard will provid.e command, telemetry acquisition and realtime data transmission\nfrom the Network Test and Training Facility (NTTF) station\nat Goddard. Additional STDN stations will he scheduled to\nbackup NTTF as needed. They will use existing standard equipment and communication links. V}TF range and range-rate\ntracking is required of a STDN station for station keeping.\nThe STDN station at Merritt Island, Fla., will provide prelaunch preparation and checkout support for the launch vehicle\nand the spacecraft. For the launch and transfer orbit phases,\nall STDN stations that view the spacecraft will support IUE.\nThe primary STDN station supporting the IUE mission will be\nthe NTTF at Goddard. Daily, the NTTF will provide 16-hour\ncontinuous support for all command and data acquisition\nfunctions for the realtime operations conducted in the SOC\nand/or 0CC. Backup support to ESA will be provided during\nthe remaining eight hours when the spacecraft is under the\ncontrol of the European ground observatory.\nIUE/DELTA TEAM\nNASA Headquarters\nDr. Noel W.
