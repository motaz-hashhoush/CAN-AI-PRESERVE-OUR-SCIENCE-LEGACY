Captive\nflights can be used to detect any flutter tendencies at\ntransonic speeds even though such flights are only\npartially representative of free flights due to support\ncharacteristics. This can be done simply as visual\ninspection of the missile after a captive flight or more\nthoroughly with the use of strain gauges, recorders,\no r telemetry. Using conventional methods of airplane\nflutter flight testing, one can also add shakers or\nimpulse devices and measure the decay rates. This\nphase of flight testing for flutter can be carried out\nat relatively low cost and yields spot checks of the\nanalytic work early enough to add confidence in the\nstructural design.\nInstrumented Programmed Flight\nNormally, the missile structure and its control\nsystem are available long in advance of the aircraft\nwhich is to carry the missile as a part of the weapon\nsystem. Flutter flight testing can then be carried\nout either in the speed and altitude capabilities of an\nexisting aircraft which may not meet the critical design conditions of tactical use, or it has to be delayed\nuntil the availability of tactical aircraft. In order to\nbridge this gap, we, in cooperation with the Lockheed\nAircraft Corporation, have developed a booster technique for our missiles which has proved very successful.\n\nA number of experimental missiles are equipped\nwith special instrumentation for monitoring performance and flutter data, and their guidance units are\nreplaced by program control timers. The instrumentation can thereby be optimized to measure the response of predetermined missile maneuvers at prescribed launch altitudes and speeds. The missilebooster combination is carried aloft by a suitable\naircraft and released by it when the attitude, speed,\nand altitude of the aircraft a r e such that after\nbooster rocket-engine burnout the combination would\nbe at the desired flight angle and the maximum\ncritical design launch speed, or slightly in excess of\nit. Timers and acceleration switches carried in the\nbooster delay its ignition by a preselected drop time\nand ignite the missile rocket-engine after booster\nburnout. The missile then carries aut programmed\nmaneuvers.\nThree types of flutter instrumentation have\nbeen used successfully in flight tests using the\nbooster technique. They are as follows:\nThe f i r s t consists of a p a i r of aft-looking 16 mm.\nmodified GSAP* Fairchild cameras mounted in a\nspecial recoverable nose section. These cameras\nhave all four control surfaces in their view (see\nFigure 1) and photograph them in flight. This optical\ninstrumentation was used in early flight tests of\nmissiles ground launched with a booster to observe\ncontrol-surface flutter, if any, and separation of\nbooster from the missile.\n\n*Gun Sight Aiming Point\n\nFigure 1.\n\n156\n\n1\n\nMAGNETIC\n\nPICKUP\n\nX 160081 - MAGNET\n16-801TRANSDUCER\n\nFigure 2.\n\nThe second type of instrumentation isa motional\npickup developed at Hughes.\nThis consists of a small\nhorseshoe permanent\nmagnet installed in the foot of\nthe control-surface and a coil wound on a horseshoe\ncore mounted opposite this magnet and in the foot of\nthe stabilizer or wing (see Figure 2). Relative motion\ncaused by vibrations generates an AC signal whose\nmagnitude depends on the frequency and amplitude of\nvibration, and control-surface deflection. This signal\nis suitably filtered to flatten itsfrequency response\nand is fed into the coder of a telemeter unit having\n2000 sample per second pulse duration modulation.\nThe frequency, the amplitude, and the rate of subsidence or divergence of any buzz or vibration can be\nobtained by this type of instrumentation.\nThe\n\nthird\n\ntype\n\nof\n\ninstrumentation\n\ngenerating\ntype\nvibration\npickup\nend of the missile.\nThe output\ninto the same\ntype\nof telemeter\nabove.\nDestructive\nflutter\ncan\nsimply\nlooping\na wire\ninto the\nseries\nwith the pickup.\nLoss of\nthen\nindicated\nby a step\nchange\nFurther\nverification\nof flutter\nof\n\nis\n\na self-\n\nmounted\nin the aft\nof this pickup is fed\nunit as mentioned\nalso be detected\nby\ncontrol-surface\nin\na control-surface\nis\nin telemeter\nlevel.\na destructive\nnature\n\nabsence\nof flutter\nof a missile.\n\nin the\n\nMonitored Guided\n\nFlight\n\nspeed-altitudeprofile\n\nFor\nmissiles\ndesigned\nwith\nvery\nlow flutter\nmargins,\na continuous\nmonitoring\nof experimental,\nprototype,\nand production\nmissiles\nis necessary\nin\norder\nto maintain\na check\non manufacturing\ntolerances\nand fabrication\ntechniques.\nThis\ncan be accomplished\nby regular\ntelemetering\nof control-surface\nposition\nand the three\nbody angular\nrates.\nAddition\nof pitch and yaw accelerometers\nis useful\nin determining\nproper\naerodynamic\nperformance,\nthereby\nassuring\nthe\nabsence\nof instabilities\nwhich\nmight\nimpair\nthe guided\nflight\nof a missile\nand reduce\nthe\noverall\nweapon\nrealiability\nconsiderably.\nIn closing,\nwe are happy to say, in all humility,\nthat all the Falcon\nseries\nair-to-air\nguided\nmissiles\ndesigned\nso far have not experienced\na single\ncase\nof flutter,\nthem that\n\ncan\nbe\nmade\nby\nregular\n30 sample\nper\nsecond\ntelemetering\nof control-surface\nposition\nand missile\nresponse\nin body angular\nvelocities\nand accelerations.\nThe above three types of instrumentation have\nbeen used successfully by us at Hughes to confirm the\n\ntactical\n\nand hope\nway.\n\nthat\n\nwe\n\nshall\n\ncontinue\n\nto design\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
