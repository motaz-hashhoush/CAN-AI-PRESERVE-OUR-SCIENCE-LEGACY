The results of the original study tasks have already been described in the f n l report\nia\nfor that phase (reference 1)and will not be repeated here.\nThe tasks for the extended study were;\nDefine an interface between the Electrodynamic Tether System (ETS) and the\nSpace Station (SS).\nIdentify growth paths for the 100 k ETS defined in the original study to a 200\nW\nk level of performance.\nW\nQuantify orbit perturbations caused by cyclic day/night operations of a Plasma\nMotor/Generator (PMG) on the SS and explore methods of minimizing these\neffects.\nDefine the analyses, precursor technology, ground tests, and precursor\ndemonstrations leading up to a demonstration mission for an electrodynamic\ntether system that would be capable of producing maneuvering thrust levels of\n25 newtons.\nPropose a development schedule for the demonstration mission and preliminary cost estimates.\nand the results are documented in this report.\nThis report begins by defining the mission objectives for a 25 newton Plasma Motor and the\nnecessary analyses, precursor technology, ground tests, and precursor demonstrations that will\nlead up to a full scale demonstration. A preliminary development schedule and cost estimates\nare also included.\nA simplified interface between a PMG and the SS is presented in the next section. This concept is based on the latest design information for the Space Station Electrical Power System\n(EPS) and replaces the concept developed in the first phase of this study.\n\na\n\nThe last sections present discussions of the orbit perturbation analysis results and preliminary\nconcepts for IxB phasing libration control approaches for electrodynamic tethers.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-1-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\nIntroduction\n\nMembers of the BSSD study team were:\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

McCoy of NASA JSC was the\nTechnical Officer for this contract and provided valuable guidance and assistance during the\nstudy.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-2\n\n-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n1 Demonstration Mission Obiectives\nThe proof-of-concept demonstration mission, outlined in this report, is based on several assumptions about available hardware and mission scenarios. These assumptions were made to\nallow the definition of mission objectives, establishment of a tentative development schedule,\nand preliminary cost estimates.\nThe tether system is assumed to be attached to a low earth orbit (LEO)\nplatform or satellite\nthat will be referred to as the "test b e d in this report. The test bed has a power system capable\nof providing at least 200 kilowatts of energy to the tether for maximum thrust. In addition, a\nmeans of dissipating tether generated energy during libration control cycles, if required, is assumed to be available. The LeRC Spacecraft 2000 concept2might be ideal as a tether thruster\ntest bed, if sufficient power capability is available.\n\n0\n\nThe demonstration mission must be capable of fulfilling all mission objectives which include:\nan OMV-assisted tether deployment, libration control of a massive tether, production of 25\nnewtons maximum thrust, orbital maneuvers using the tether thrust generation capabilities,\nand long-term tether operations.\nConsiderations in the definition of the development mission were simplicity, low cost, maximum use of available hardware with minimum modifications, and minimum development time\nconsistent with low cost.\n\n1.1 OMV-assisted Tether Deployment Demonstration\nThe tether deployment is one of the more challenging portions of the mission. The\nelectrodynamic tether\'s metallic conductor will make the tether much harder to maneuver\nduring the deployment than lighter weight tethers. Tether packaging and construction is critical to minimize tether preset and twisting during deployment.\nDeployment of a high power electrodynamictether (ET)with a reeling mechanism would complicate the design and add significant weight penalty to the entire system. Therefore, an OMV\nassisted deployment of the tether, or tethers, is assumed as the baseline approach. The details\nof this approach are covered in an earlier report\'. The O W is also assumed to provide servicing, if required, for the end-mass consumables (i.e. plasma contactor gas supply) and orbital replacement units (ORU\'s).\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-3\n\n-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n1 Demonstration Mission Objectives\n\n1.4 Orbit Maneuvers Using Plasma Motor\n\n1.2 Dual Tether Operation\nThe demonstration flight could be accomplished as a dual or single tether mission. However,\nmany proposed tether applications would require the disturbing torques, applied by the tether\nto the spacecraft or platform, to be minimized. Consequently, a dual tether demonstration\nmission would provide more data and is assumed as the baseline. The dual tether approach\ncomplicates the mission, increases costs, and lengthens the development schedule. Therefore,\nthe costbenefit trades of this choice should be further evaluated in the Phase A studies for\nthis project.\nA phased approach to the demonstration may be desireable from a funding viewpoint. In this\napproach a single tether would be demonstrated first, and a second tether would be added to\nthe system after preliminary testing was completed with the single tether. This would allow\ncharacterization of the ETS under both single and dual tether operation. The major design impact would be the addition of hollow cathodes and their support subsystem to the test bed end\nof each tether. This approach also assumes in orbit installation of the ETS on the test bed.\n\nThe baseline approach will allow the operation of dual tethers to be explored over the entire\nLOE operation regime. The combined effects on the test bed, tethers, and end masses can be\nfully explored with this configuration.\n\n1.3 Twenty-Five Newton Thrust Level\nThe primary purpose of this demonstration of electrodynamic tethers is to provide a long-term\nreliable source of maneuvering thrust for platforms and/or satellites to a peak of 25 newtons\n(5.6 lbf).\n\n1.4 Orbit Maneuvers Using Plasma Motor\n\n0\n\nThrust levels and timing will be varied during the flight to evaluate the orbital maneuvering\ncapabilities of the ETS.The orbit maneuvers will be designed to verify the capability of this\nsystem throughout its operating envelope. The types of maneuvers that can be demonstrated\ninclude: changes in semi-major axis, orbit phasing, eccentricity,line of apsides, inclination, and\nascending node. Thrustldrag control algorithms will be developed to simultaneously control\norbit maneuvers and tether librations. The controller hardware will be designed to allow control system software modifications after launch. This is necessary to permit on-obit testing of\ndistinct current control schemes that are a function of the type of maneuver being attempted.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-4\n\n-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n2 HardwadSoTtware Requirements\n\n2.1 Tether\n\n1.5 Extended High Power Tether Operations\nThe effects of extended orbital operations on tether materials and operating efficiency are important since the advantage of using this system for propulsion accrues over prolonged periods\nof time. In addition, this information will allow a better assessment of the repair and maintenance requirements for the tether and related hardware. Initial selection of tether materials\nwill be based on results from ground simulations of the orbital environments on candidate\ntether materials. However, the full evaluation of synergistic effects and orbital debris damage\nwill only be possible by studying the prolonged operations of tethers in orbit.\nMeasurements of EMI/EMC levels at the test bed, over time, will help evaluate the effectiveness of design measures taken to limit this potential problem.\n\n0\n\nA project the size of a 25N Electrodynamic Tether Plasma Motor will require a variety of\nprecursor tasks and developments in the areas of analysis, technology, ground testing, and\nproof-of-concept demonstrations leading up to the actual demonstration mission. Table 2- 1is\na preliminary listing of some major items that must be included in this precursory work. Many\nof these items would be included in the Phase AD3 portions of the demonstration mission\ndefinition, and others would be the result of technology fall out from other NASA and industry\nR&D projects. For instance, many of the items listed under "Electrical Components/Hardware" will be covered by R&D efforts related to development of the electrical\npower system for Space Station. The purpose of Table 2-1 is to highlight those areas were current technology needs to be augmented with further study and or development.\n\nFigure 1-1 illustrates how many current and proposed NASA projects will benefit the ETS\ndevelopment. This figure also provides a tentative time line for those areas where specific\ndevelopments are required prior to starting the Phase C D project for the 25N thruster\ndemonstration mission.\n\n2.1 Tether\nThe tether is the primary component of the electrodynamic tether system (ETS) repreand\nsents a single point failure in most designs. Therefore, careful analysis, design and testing will\nbe required for this component.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-5-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n2 HardwaWSoftware Requirements\n\n2.1 Tether\n\nTechnology\n\nAnalysis\nUpgndo to GTOSS umlysb pgm.\n\nGround Tests\n\n.

Current analysis tools\ndo not allow cost effective long-term simulations of the tether motion under the influence of\nall external forces and disturbances. In addition, these tools will have to be upgraded to allow\nthe modeling of thrust and libration control algorithms.\nMany of the orbit manuevers that a low thrust ET could perform occur over a period of several\ndays or weeks. These maneuvers will be simulated many times during the design and operational phases of the program to facilitate control algorithm development and mission planning\noperations. It is recommended that an engineering design software tool be developed to allow\nrapid evaluation of variations in tether current on orbital motion. This computer program\nwould be used in the preliminary design phase, possibly on a personal computer, and allow\nrapid evaluation of current control algorithms. The larger analysis programs would then be\nused to do detailed evaluation of the tether and system orbital motion based on the preliminary control algorithms developed. This detailed analysis would then be used to "tune"the algorithms as necessary.\nThe safety issues surrounding the use of a tether involve the presence of high voltages and the\nrecoil from a broken tether. Analysis of failure modes for the tether will be required during\nthe definition and preliminary design phases. This will include failures in the tether insulation\nas well as complete mechanical failure of the tether due to impact or fatigue. Analysis of the\nbroken tether will require many simulations to completely envelope the possible initial and\nboundary conditions for the failure.\nThe high voltages and currents developed in the tether and operation of the plasma contac-\n\ntors could present EMI/EMC problems for electronic equipment on the primary vehicle.\nElectrical simulations to assess the magnitude of these effects should be carried out early in\nthe preliminary design phase.\n2.1.2 Precursor Technology\n\nNo precursor technology developments are necessary since several viable tether designs have\nbeen proposed33495\nbased on current materials and technology. However, continued developments in materials technology in the areas of insulators, conductors, and coatings should be\nmonitored for application to the tether design.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-7-\n\nContract NM9-17666\n\n2 Hardware/Software Requirements\n\n2.1 Tether\n\nMethods of fabricating electrodynamic tethers will have to be developed. Commercial cable\nfabrication techniques may need to be modified to accommodate space quality construction.\nMethods will be developed to apply the appropriate thermal control and environmental\nprotection coatings to the cable insulation.\nOn orbit failure of a tether will require either a complete replacement of the tether or repair\nof the tether to restore complete functionality. Replacement of the tether is not a cost effective alternative if robotic servicing and maintenance facilities are available.\n\nPreliminary on-orbit repair devices and procedures will have to be developed to assure extended life operation for the tether. Some of this technology may be developed and tested as\na result of the demonstration flight. However, basic repair and maintenance concepts should\nalready be in place when this system flies. Smaller systems can be used to develope and\ndemonstrate the repair techniques and devices. It is anticipated that repair, inspection, and\nmaintenance of the tether will need to be accomplished using robotic devices that can perform\ntheir tasks without significant human intervention. This type of technology is currently being\npursued by the US and Italians under a letter of agreement with NASA6.\n\na\n\n2.13 Ground Tests\n\nEMIEMC testing will be accomplished on the tether components in combination with the\nconverters and control electronics to verify and improve on analytical results. This testing will\ninvolve high power levels and can make use of the new test facilities at LeRc that are being\ndeveloped for Space Station. Evaluation of the EMVEMC impact of the tether itself will be a\ngoal of the demonstration flight.\nMaterials testing for UV, AO, and high energy particle degradation can be accomplished i\nn\nground facilities. These tests will be completed under the Space Station Advanced Development Program7 and should not have to be repeated for the tether development.\nThermal cycling of the tether will be accomplished to evaluate the effect of differential expansion between the insulation and the conductor on tether performance and life. A means of\nthermal cycling a 10to 20 kilometer long tether over its expected operating temperature range\nwill have to be devised.\nGround tests of robotic devices to repair and maintain the tether insulation and conductor can\nbe accomplished prior to the need for flight testing. Tether crawlers are a candidate for the\ntether inspection and repair tasks and should be initially tested using ground facilities.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-8-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n2 HardwadSoftware Requirements\n\n2 2 Electrical Components/Hardware\n\n2.1.4 Precursor Demonstrations\n\nOn-orbit inspection and repair of electrodynamic tethers will be demonstrated prior to this\nflight. Work in this area is being pursued by the US and Italy. It is anticipated that a crawlertype device will be developed and demonstrated that will affect autonomous on-orbit inspection and repair of electrodynamic tethers. The Tether Elevator/Crawler System (TECS) is a\njoint USfltalian demonstration that is being proposed6as a possible new start in the next 4 to\n7 years.\n\n2.2 Electrical Components/Hardware\nThe electrical devices to regulate, convert, and conduct the ET current will need a greater\npower handling capacity than present space qualified equipment provides. Most of the electrical components needed to assemble the ET control devices are currently under development\nin support of the Space Station power system (see Figure 2-1). These components and the associated design methodology should be very mature by the time it is needed for constructing\nan ETS.\nThe primary component that is unique to the tether application is the hollow cathode plasma\ncontactor and it is the subject of current research and development activities by NASA and\nothers899910911\n221 Analvsis\n..\nCircuit simulations of the tether converter stack, control electronics, and safety devices will\nbe required. These computer simulations will evaluate the performance of the system under\n\nvarious operating load profiles and control procedures. The simulations should be performed\nbefore actual construction of the converters to assure the feasibility of the design approach.\nThis type of simulation is currently being performed at NASA LeRC in support of the Space\nStation Power Management and Distribution System performance and design in the EASY5\nmodeling project12. LeRC is using EASY5 to develop a library of component simulation\nmodels that will be applicable to the ETS converter and controller designs with little or no\nmodification. Analysis of system response to various failure modes will also be accomplished\nusing this simulation methodology.\nThe purpose of these simulations would be to improve the design and assure long-term operation of the system without extensive maintenance requirements. Secondary benefits of the\nanalysis would include development of better control algorithms and improved knowledge\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-9-\n\nContract NM9-17666\n\n2 HardwadSoftware Requirements\n\n2 2 Electrical ComponentsMardware\n\nabout the expected performance of individual components, which will be needed i other\nn\ndesign areas such as thermal control, packaging and EMVEMC.\n22.2 Precursor Technoloa\n\nComponent technology developments will be necessary to support the high power and voltage requirements of the ETS. Commercial and DOD interests in this technology promises to\nproduce many of the solid-state components required for the ETS under other programs. Advanced development is also proceeding in the areas of magnetics and capacitor capabilities.\nTherefore, precursor technology programs for these components that are specific to the ETS\nshould not be necessary.\nHollow cathodes are used to complete the circuit between the tether and the space plasma.\nDevelopment in this area will need to continue in order to reach reliable operation at the current levels needed for high power tether systems.\n2.23 Ground Tests\n\nPreliminary testing of the hollow cathode devices is being accomplished in ground facilities.\nHowever, testing of the higher power devices, at full power, will probably not be possible in\nground facilities. Full power characterization and extended operation of the hollow cathodes\nwill need to be accomplished in space.\nThe converter stack design and operation can be tested using ground facilities, although operation at full power (200 kW) may not be feasible. Reduced power testing of the stack will still\nprovide valuable performance information on the control electronics, control algorithms, and\nconfiguration of the converter stack during normal and simulated failure conditions. The\nLeRC test facilitieswill be required for most of the converter and controller testing acth ties.\nEMI/EMC testing of the individual converters, complete converter stack, and the tether tself\ncan be completed, possibly at reduced power levels, in ground test facilities.\n2.2.4 Precursor Demonstrations\n\nDemonstration of the converters, both individually and in series, will be a demonstration milestone during the early development phase. The converters proposed for the ETS are identical\nto the ones being used in the Space Station Power System. The development test demonstrations of these systems will be a milestone for further ETS development activities. If the Space\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-10-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n2 Hardware/Sofhvare Requirements\n\n2 3 System Measurements and Monitors\n\nStation design is changed the ETS design should be re-evaluated. If the resonant converter\ntechnology is retained for the ETS, then a separate demonstration of the converter operation\nwould have to be made part of the development cycle.\nSuccessful operation of the hollow cathodes is required before proceedingwith the demonstration flight. Hollow cathode operation, at a low power level, will be demonstrated during the\nTethered Satellite (TSS-1) mission with the Hollow Cathode Plasma Bridge (HCPB) experiment. Another experiment in development is the Plasma MotodGenerator-Proof Of Function (PMG-POF) Hitch-Hiker G payload that will fly on the STS in a few years. Dr. Jim McCoy\nof NASA JSC is the principal investigator for both of these experiments. Several other\ndemonstrations of these devices have either been completed\xe2\x80\x99 or are in the advanced development phases710.Results of these experiments will help in the characterization of the hollow\ncathode performance.\n\n2 3 System Measurements and Monitors\n\n@\n\nRequirements for ETS measurements and monitors have not been clearly defined yet, but they\nwill at least include current, voltage, magnetic field vector, and tether position. During the\ndeployment phase a means of monitoring the position of the tether and end-mass will be required for safety reasons and to implement IxB phasing libration control algorithms. It is not\nanticipated that advances in the state-of-the-art will be required to implement ETS measurement and monitoring requirements.\n\n23.1 Analysis\nDefinition of the measurement accuracies, ranges, and bandwidths need to be established by\ndetailed analysis of the ETS requirements. These requirements will be driven by the libration\ncontrol system, current control specifications, and any constraints of the test bed. The main\nfocus of the analysis should be a technology trade that will result in the performance requirements being met at the lowest cost.\nControl and dynamic simulations of the deployed tether will refine the requirements for equipment to determine the end-mass state vector and tether position. This analysis could be performed with a version of GTOSS that has been updated to include the control algorithm\nsimulation.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-11-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n24 Software\n.\n\n2 Hardware/So!\xe2\x80\x99tware Requirements\n\n23.2 Precursor Technolorn\n\nTechnology development is not anticipated for the sensor and measurement hardware since\nall required measurements can be made with currently available equipment (Le. radar, magnetometers, voltage and current sensors, etc...).However, software simulationand analysis improvements will be needed to fully define the requirements for the state vector and tether\nposition determination hardware.\n2 3 3 Ground Tests\n\nGround testing and evaluation of the sensor and measurement hardware is possible, but onorbit evaluation of the end-mass state vector determination system will be required.\n23.4 Precursor Demonstrations\nAn orbital demonstration of the ability to monitor, sense, and predict tether position and end-\n\nmass state vector is recommended.This demonstrationcould probably be combined with other\nexperiments that are being planned for STS or ELV launch over the next few years. TSS-1 will\nprovide valuable information about tether dynamics and sensing end-mass state vector.\n\n0\n\n2.4 Software\nSoftware requirements for the ETS will be concentrated in three areas: libration control, orbit\nmaneuvers, and converter operation and sequencing.The libration control and orbit maneuver\nalgorithms will need to be closely coupled and, therefore, developed simultaneously.The control of the resonant converter operation is a separate task and much of the algorithm development will be identical to the Space Station system. Maximum use will be made of the software\nand hardware from this advanced development work.\n2.4.1 Analysis\n\n0\n\nEquations of motion for the tether system will be developed and a set of control laws established. The highly complex and non-linear behavior of the tether system will require considerable simplification in the equations of motion for control law development. Therefore,\nextensive coupled non-linear computer simulations of the tethers under the control laws will\nbe needed to verify performance. The attitude control and converter control software will be\ncoupled to the tether dynamics software (possibly GTOSS)to perform fully coupled simulations of the ETS system.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n- 12 -\n\nContract NAs9-17666\n\n2 HardwadSofbvare Requirements\n\n2 5 Logistics\n\n2.42 Precursor Technology\n\nNone.\n2.43 Ground Tests\n\nGround testing will not be possible for the libration and maneuver software. However, the\nresonant converter control software and its interface with the control software can be tested\nin facilities at LeRC.\n2.4.4 Precursor Demonstrations\nA small scale demonstration of the converter and control techniques would be feasible. A low\npower (1to 5 kW) system could be placed in operation very quickly using available hardware\nand technology. Possibly, the TSS-1 hardware could be modified to perform a demonstration\nof series resonant converter operation and tether libration control using IxB techniques. A\nlower cost approach may be to develop a dedicated tether payload for ELV launch that could\ndemonstrate operation of the converters and all software.\n\n2.5 Logistics\nThe design areas that need the greatest effort over the next few years will be in the repair,\nmaintenance, and retirement of tethers. The deployed tether presents a large area to orbital\ndebris and is constantly exposed to the near earth space environment. In order for the benefits\nof tether systems to be realized and to meet the expected mission requirements of many host\nvehicles the tether must have a relatively long operational lifetime. A broken tether presents\na potential safety problem for the host vehicle and for other orbiting objects. An obsolete\ntether system must be removed from orbit or I\'safed\'\' in some other manner or it will become\na source of orbital debris.\nNASA and Italy are both studying the problem of tether repair and maintenance and have suggested designs and concepts for devices to repair and maintain orbiting tethers. A broken or\nsevered tether will be very difficult to repair and additional study will be needed in this area.\nThe hollow cathodes require a gas supply, so a means of servicing these supplies must be\ndeveloped for long-term applications. The OMV fluid servicing facility is a likely candidate\nfor this task, but methods of docking the OMV with the moving end-mass must be developed.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n- 13 -\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n2 Hardware/Software Requirements\n\n2 5 Logistics\n\n2.5.1 Deployment\n\nOne of the most technically challenging aspects of the ETS is the design and development of\na system to deploy the tether. The deployment will require the use of automated systems and\nprocedures. The techniques and designs arrived at during this study need additional analytical evaluation and precursor demonstrationsbefore development can proceed on the baseline\n25 newton plasma thruster.\n2511 Analysis\n...\n\nThree methods of deploying tethers are currently being evaluated for various tether applications. These methods are reel5, SEDS-type\', and OMV-assisted2. Extensive analysis has been\ncompleted and is in progress for the first two methods. The reel and SEDS-type deployments\ncan be simulated using a variety of currently available software tools. However, the OMV-assisted deploymentswill require additional capabilities in the analysis tools to simulate the control algorithm for the OMV thrusters. If reel and SEDS-type deployments are determined to\nbe inappropriate for the ETS system, then additional enhancements to the tether simulation\nsoftware will be required. It is possible that the tether deployment simulation tools used for\nthe TSS-1mission analysis may be able to handle this type of deployment with minor modifications.\nAnalysis of an OMV-assisted deployment should include evaluation of normal deployment\nand failure modes. Failure modes will include tether binding, OMV attitude control failure,\nand tether mechanical failure. Appropriate procedures will have to be developed for each of\nthese failure modes and any others identified during the design phase.\nThe baseline design arrived at during this study assumes that the OMV will be capable of servicing the plasma cathode gas supply on the end-mass. Therefore, analysis of and procedures\nfor an OMV rendezvous with the tether tip m s will be required. Preliminary control algoas\nrithms and analysis of this scenario has been publishedu for an actively controlled end-mass.\nThis analysis should be extended to evaluate the performance with a passive end-mass.\n2.5.12 Precursor Technology\nPackaging techniques for a massive tether will have to be developed. The deployment forces\nand rates will have to be kept low so any preset or permanent warping of the tether must be\navoided. Gravitational and acceleration forces could cause settling of the tether during ground\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-34-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n2 5 Logistics\n\n2 HardwaWSofhvare Requirements\n\nand launch operations. This settling could lead to binding of the tether during the deployment\nstage. Methods of packing the tether to avoid this must be developed.\nIt may be necessary to pre-twist the tether during the process of putting the tether in its container for launch. The pre-twist will keep the tether from twisting during the deployment phase.\nPre-twisting a tether of this size may require the development of new hardware.\n2.5.13 Ground Tests\n\nGround testing and simulation of a tether deployment is very desirable. However, it may not\nbe practical for a tether of this size. A study to determine the feasibility and cost benefit of\nground testing versus the risk of flying the mission without a test should be accomplished.\nThe ground tests that are possible for the tether deployment system will be quite limited. This\nis because of the system size, gravitational effects, and complexity a full-up simulated tether\ndeployment test. It may be possible to simulated portions of the deployment, like start up, with\nsimplified test procedures and fixtures. The range of ground tests that are possible and useful\nshould be the subject of early system trades.\n\n0\n\n2.5.1.4 Precursor Demonstrations\n\nFlights of SEDS-type deployers are currentlyplanned for early in the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s.These demonstration missions will provide valuable data for the OMV-assisted deployments. One possible\nscenario for the OMV-assisted deployment is for the OMV to simply provide the initial separation and attitude control. At a certain point the deployment would transition to a SEDS-type\ndeployment with the O M V simply providing velocity and attitude control. Near the end of the\ndeployment the OMV would arrest the excess velocity of the end-mass. The early demonstrations of SEDS-type deployments will provide needed information to refine the ET deployment scenario.\nThe OMV should be operational for several years before the ETS demonstration so its abilities\nto assist in deployments will already have been established. The response of the O W , while\nattached to other payloads, will provide valuable input to the overall deployment strategy for\nthe ETS. It is likely that the OMV can be used to deliver the ETS to the test bed, install it on\nthe test bed, and then deploy the tether.\n2.52 Maintenance\n\n- 15 -\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~-\n\n~\n\n~~\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n~\n\n2 5 Logistics\n\n2 HardwaxdSoftware Requirements\n\nShort duration (one year or less) ETS missions would probably not require servicing and maintenance requirements should be minimal. However, for the longer duration missions a number of maintenance and servicing items have been identified including; hollow cathode gas\nre-supply, converter replacement, end-mass servicing, and tether repair. Many of these maintenance tasks can be accomplished by the OMV using planned servicing facility attachments.\nOthers may require the development of ETS unique robotic devices, procedures, and\nmaterials.\n2.5.2.1 Analysis\n\nThe tether maintenance requirements will be a function of the orbital environment. Orbital\ndebris will be the greatest threat to a deployed tether. Preliminary assessment of this threat\nhas already been completed14.However, detailed analysis of the debris environment will be\nrequired to determine the appropriate maintenance scheduling for the tether. This analysis\nwill also yield information on the configuration of the tethers. For instance, if the debris hazard\nis too great, a multiple tether approach may have to be re-evaluated to meet minimum lifetime\nand reliability requirements.\n\n0\n\n2.5.2.2 Precursor Technology\n\nMaintenance for the tether system will require the development of advanced robotic technology. The OMV and tether crawler technology will be required for ETS maintenance functions.\nThe OMV technology is being developed to support other NASA programs and the tether\ncrawler technology is being pursued by current and planned future technology development\nefforts.\n\n2 5 2 Ground Tests\n..3\nEnvironmental effects on candidate tether material can be tested in ground facilities. These\neffects include UV, AO, high energy particles, contamination and temperature. It will also be\npossible to do impact studies on samples of tether construction to quantify impact damage\nfrom orbital debris.\nSimulated OMV servicing missions will probably be accomplished in ground simulators that\nwill be available for OMV mission planning. These simulated mission will be used to verify interfaces and procedures before the maintenance mission is flown by the OMV.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-16-\n\nContract NM9-17666\n\n2 HardwadSoftware Requirements\n\n2 5 Logistics\n\nDevelopment testing on the hollow cathodes will yield information about gas flow rates that\ncan be used to size the gas supply and predict the required servicing interval. Servicing of the\nend-mass gas supply may require the OMV to dock with a librating tethered object. Hopefully, the procedures and algorithms required for this function can be developed and tested using\nground simulators.\n2.5.2.4 Precursor Demonstrations\n\nDemonstrations of tether crawlers, OMV remote docking operations, and OMV servicing\nfunctions will be required prior to the ETS demonstration mission. If a short term demonstration mission is decided on the crawler and OMV servicing demonstration would not be necessary. Docking of the OMVwith a tethered end-mass could either be a precursor demonstration\nrequirement, or be made a part of the ETS demonstration mission.\n2.53 Retirement\n\nWhen the demonstration ETS system has fulfilled its mission objectives or otherwise becomes\nunproductive the systemwill have to be "retired". This will mean stowing the tether and probably removing the ETS from the test bed. Since the baseline design provides for no reel-in\ncapability an alternate means of stowing the tether needs to be developed.\n2.53.1 Analysis\n\nPlanning for the retirement of the ETS will require an analysis of mission requirements and a\nprediction of the expected lifetime of the tether system. At least two different retirement\nscenarios need to be investigated. One involves normal retirement due to completion of mission objectives or deteriorated ETS performance. The second type of retirement is for an ETS\nthat has suffered irreparable damage or failure. This second type could be the result of a broken\ntether, in which case the recovery of the end-mass and attached tether segment needs to be\nconsidered.\nAnalysis of the orbital behavior of the end-mass will be required to predict its orbital decay\nrate or to facilitate a rendezvous with the OMV for recovery.\nFinal disposal of the ETS could be by forced re-entry and bum up in the atmosphere, STS\nrecovery to earth, or simply wound onto a container that would remain in orbit on the test bed.\nEach of these scenarios will need to be analyzed to determine the most cost effective alterna-\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n- 17 -\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n2 HardwaxdSoftware Requirements\n\n2.5 Logistics\n\ntive. There may also be other alternatives to be considered, such as using the ETS equipment\nas raw material for orbital construction.\n2.532 Precursor Technolopy\n\nNone.\n2.533 Ground Tests\n\nGround testing of tether retrieval devices will be required. It is anticipated that these devices\nwill be simplified reelers to temporarily store the tether until it can be de-orbited or permanently stored on orbit. Existing facilities used for the ETS construction and test should be\nsufficient for these tests.\n2.53.4 Precursor Demonstrations\n\nNone.\n\n0\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-18-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n3 Preliminary Development Schedule & Costs\n\n0\n\n3 Preliminary Development Schedule & Costs\nA development schedule for a 25 Newton Plasma Motor is presented in Figure 3-1. This\nschedule is based on the design presented in reference 1with the electrical interface modifications presented latter in this report (see section 4). The physical description of the system is\npresented in Figure 3-2. It basically consists of two Integrated Carrier Assemblies (ICA) that\nare connected together, on orbit, to form the Plasma Motor.\n\nw\n\nn\n\n-\n\n5\n\nHamhuoDniin\nCormrter Deaign\nTether w\nn\n\nSOclmnDaiinlDmkpnnnt\nFabrication\n\n1ntegnt.d Canier Assembly I 1\nIntegrated Cmkf Assembly 12\nCmvwlen\ncontrol EWrOnicr\nTether\nTesting phw\nSlNctunl Testing\nVibmlmn Testing\nTh.nnal VW\n\nEMVEMC\nP o w r Syatem Operations\nLaunchO p e r a t i i s\nDelhry to Launch Faclllty\nIntogratlon and Check out\nLaunch\nOpe~ions\nphw\nTethr D.plqmnnt by OMV\nInYal Checkout Period\n-In 0n.orbit OpoRliQM\n\n0\n1\n\nFigure 3-1 Preliminary Development Schedule\n\n0\n\nEach of the ICA\'s consist of a Fixed Carrier Assembly (FCA) and a Deployed Carrier Assembly (DCA). The FCA is joined to the DCA during launch by a Deck-to-Deck Interface Structure (DDIS). The FCA remains attached to the test bed after the tether is deployed, and the\nDCA is deployed with the tether. The tether provides the physical connection between the\nFCA and DCA after tether deployment. This design has no reeling mechanism since the tether\nis deployed by the O W off a specially designed spool. Both carrier assemblies are constructed\nof honeycomb decks with trunnions for attachment to the STS for launch and/or recovery. A\nstandard grapple fixture is attached to each ICA to allow the STS Remote Manipulator System to be used for moving the ICA\'s out of the STS Bay for attachment to either an OMV or\ndirectly to the test bed vehicle. The ICA\'s are designed so that they can be brought to orbit\nand deployed individually.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n- 19 -\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n3 Preliminary Development Schedule & Costs\n\nFigure 3-2 Electrodynamic Tether Design Concept\nThe FCA provides support for the equipment that remains wt the test bed. This includes the\nih\nconverter modules, transformers, converter controllers, tether communications and state vector determinationequipment, tether guillotine, and converter thermal control coldplates.The\nDCA becomes the end m s for the electrodynamic tether and provides a structural support\nas\nfor the end-mass equipment including; gas supply, hollow cathodes, power supply, batteries,\nsolar arrays, control electronics, and equipment for communicating with the FCA. The FCA\nand DCA both have interface devices to allow attachment to the test bed and OMV respectively. The FCA is designed to have a Space Station type electrical, data and thermal interface\nto the test bed. The DCA needs only a mechanical interface and possibly a high pressure gas\ninterface if the end-mass requires servicing of its hollow cathode gas supply over the mission\nlifetime.\nThe development schedule for this system is shown in Figure 3-1. The three main phases design, fabrication, and testing - each last approximately 18 months. However, the fabrication\nand test phases overlap because the construction of the converters and one ICA is completed\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-20\n\n-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n3 Preliminary Development Schedule & Costs\n\nwhile the production of the second ICA and its converters continue. The converters and first\nICA will be started through their test programs while work continues on the second ICA. This\nscheduling results in a duration of about four years from contract start to launch. This schedule\nassumes that both ICA\xe2\x80\x99s will be launched on the same STS flight. If they are launched on\nseparate flights the first ICA could be ready for launch three to six months before the second\nICA.\nA test bed with 200 kW power capacity will probably not be available until early in the 21st\n\ncentury. At that time significant progress will have been made in many of the technology areas\n(see Figure 2-1) important to the development of this system. Each phase of the demonstartion mission has some key technology issues that will be pacing items. In the design phase it\nwill be the converters, and deployment spool. In the fabrication phase it will be the tether.\nDuring the testing phase the full scale testing of the converters and tether for operating characteristics and EMYEMCwillbe pacing items. In the orbital operations phase the remote deployments, servicing, and repair will be key technology requirements.\n\n@\n\nA preliminary cost estimate of this program from Phase C/D contract award through launch\nhas been completed. This cost estimate is based on work completed earlier (reference 1)that\nwas modified to include the results of the extended study tasks. The primary impact of the extended study was in the converter costs (increased to 6 per ICA) and the addition of an interface transformer between the test bed electrical power system (assumed to be identical to the\nproposed Space Station EPS) and the tether converter modules (see Figure 4-2). Table 3-1\nsummarizes the preliminary cost estimates for the hardware to support a demonstration mission of this size.\nThe converter estimates are based on a bi-directional design suitable for a Plasma\nMotor/Generator (PMG) system. Technically the Plasma Motor design only needs to operate\nin one direction (thrust). However, it is very likely that even a system whose primary function\nis thrust generation will require bi-directional operation for libration control and possibly, to\nallow for reduction in orbit altitude. Also, the technology that is being used for their design is\nbased on the Space Station PMAD system which is bi-directional. Therefore, the converter\ndesign was assumed to be bi-directional.\nThe non-recurring engineering costs are estimated to be $25M and the recurring costs are\n$9.8M per Integrated Carrier Assembly.

These\nORU\'s include the standard ORU package housing, selected portions of the RBI (Remote\nBus Isolator), power distribution cabling, a modified version of the Main Inverter Units\n(MIU), and a modified version of the TU (Transformer Unit). In addition the PMAD\ncontrol bus will be utilized for control and switching of the tether converter (CV) units.\nFigure 4-1 shows a simplified overview of one-half of the PMAD system.\n\n- --e\nBETA\n\nD.C.\n\nc\n\nAc-\n\nMIU\n\nD.C.\n\nMIU\n\nD.C.\n\nD.C.\n46kw\n\n48kw\n\nSAME AS TOP SEC.

This is accomplished by means of phasor control (as used in the PMAD\nMIU\xe2\x80\x99s) - the vector sum of the two CV outputs in each TCU is matched in phase and\nmagnitude with the PMAD system 44OVAC bus and fed to each XFMR coupled to the\nbus.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n- 24 -\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n.\n\n4 Electrodynamic Tether Electrical Interfaces\n\nIn the motor mode, each TCU has AC fed through the bus coupling XFMR to each CV in\nparallel, and in phase. Now, each CV acts as a full-wave rectifier providing DC to the\ntether. Since regulation by phasor control is not possible in this mode of operation, a\nmethod known as "pulse population controltts will be used. This technique simply provides\nmore or less of the half-sine rectified AC pulses to the tether (through an averaging filter)\nto give the desired DC output. The "pulse population control" is achieved by using\nreverse-connected thyristors (instead of the usual rectifiers) in the resonant converter\ncircuit and gating these on and off using an algorithm designed to achieve the desired DC\noutput level. Not shown are any PMAD bus disconnects which may be required to satisfy\nSS safety requirements.\n\n0\n-\n\nFigure 4-3 shows the basic power flow between one TCU and the prime power source for\nthe PMAD system, together with the basic switching required for generator/motor\ntransition. The bus coupling transformer is a. modified version of the TU in the PMAD\nsystem. The tether transformer is modified to have a tapped winding on the tether side in\norder to supply a motor mode AC voltage higher than the generator mode AC (this is\nrequired to overcome the tether back EMF). Load switching uses hybrid switches\nconsisting of double-pole, double-throw (DPDT) contacts shunted by bi-directional\nthyristors. The bi-directional thyristors provide arc-free switching, and minimum\nconduction loss with the mechanical contacts. Transformer ratios and power ratings for\nboth a lOOkW and a 200kW system are shown.\nFigure 4-4 shows the voltage ratios required in each transformer for both generator and\nmotor modes. The 208V and 520V windings are combined into a single 520V winding with\na tap at 208V, as shown in Figure 4-3.\nFigure 4-5 shows the basic CV unit having the identical topology as those used in the\nPMAD MIU\'s. This is basically a bi-directional H-bridge 20 lcHz resonant converter as\nshown in the original design. However, the circuit has now been coupled with appropriate\nfiltering (shown as a basic filter), and includes provisions to optimize the filter for each\nmode of operation.\nThe basic filter circuit requires either an inboard or an outboard storage capacitor\ndepending on the mode of operation. In the generator mode a storage capacitor on the\ninboard side of the filter inductor is required, however in the motor mode an outboard\ncapacitor is required. By placing an isolation resistor in series with the inboard storage\ncapacitor, it can effectively be removed from the circuit in the motor mode. For generator\nmode operation the relay shorts out the resistor and allows the inboard storage capacitor\nto operate properly. The outboard capacitor does not effect generator mode operation.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-25\n\n-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n4 2 Revised Estimates of System Parameters\n\n4 Electrodynamic Tether Electrical interfaces\n\nI\n\nl W -TETHERCONVERSION UNIT (2 - TEMER CONMRTERS.

Therefore, it is recommended that the\nsystem be designed with 25kW CV units, rather than trying to parallel two of the original\n12.5kW units. This results in only about a 25% increase in weight vs. double the weight of\ntwo 12.5kW units.\nDue to the higher motor mode voltages (compared to the lOOkW system) necessary to\novercome the increased tether power losses, the total number of CV\'s has been increased\nfrom 8 to 12 in order that individual CV voltage levels stay within reasonable limits.\nTwelve converters also allow for a 300kW peak power capability for short times.\nFigure 4-6 shows a simplified 200kW interface which is identical in concept to the original\nlOOkW interface. Only the number of TCU\'s and voltages are different. Refer to Figure 43 for the appropriate transformer voltages in the 200 kW design concept.\nFigure 4-7 shows the electrical equivalent of the 200kW tether system operating in the\ngenerator mode.

For instance, the duration of the daytime\nthrusting scenario had to be made variable in duration and start time. It was also necessary\nto add an "energy monitor" to assure that the various operations schemes did not\nsignificantly alter the orbital average system energy and introduce orbital perturbations in\nexcess of those attributable to the basic electrodynamic tether operation.\nA change was also made to DTOSS. The parameters of interest for orbit perturbation\nanalysis were not available on any of the standard page formats supplied (version Dl).\nTherefore, an additional page format was added to output only the information considered\ncritical to evaluating solution stability and orbit perturbation effects.\n\nThe following routines were effected by these changes:\nProgram\n\nModule\n\nModification\n\nGTOSS\n\nTOSSFQ\n\nChanged\n\nGTOSS\n\nTOSSH3\n\nDTOSS\n\nXPGDEF\n\nChanged\n\nDTOSS\n\nXPGHD\n\nChanged\n\nDTOSS\n\nXPGLN\n\nChanged\n\nDTOSS\n\nYPDF55\n\nAdded\n\nDTOSS\n\nYPDFELl\n\nAdded\n\nDTOSS\n\nYPHD55\n\nAdded\n\nDTOSS\n\nYPLN55\n\nAdded\n\n,\n\nAdded\n\nThe modification to the standard day/night power generation option was made by allowing\na third type of power generation scenario. The type "3" scenario was implemented by\nmaking code changes to routine TOSSFQ and adding routine TOSSJB. This latter routine\nis modeled after the standard TOSS routine TOSSH2. The major changes involve the\ninterpretation of the scenario input blocks and the addition of orbital state monitors for\nenergy and time from orbital sunrise.\nThe scenario input for type "3"dayhight operations are just like the standard type "2"\ninputs except the "Ending Power Level" parameter is used to specify how many seconds to\ndelay after orbit sunrise before starting motor mode operations. Motor operations are\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n- 34 -\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n5 Orbit Perturbation Analysis\n\n53 Analysis Results\n\nterminated when the energy monitor (explained below) crosses zero or orbit sunset is\nreached.\nThe energy monitor is zeroed at the beginning of a run and constantly updates the changes\nin orbital energy during the generator/motor operations. The change in orbital energy is\napproximated by the trapezoidal integration of power (in or out of tether) with respect to\ntime. The monitor is programmed to stop motor operations when the system energy\ncrosses zero. Motodgenerator operations are inhibited until the first orbital sunset. This\nguarantees that the first changes in orbital energy will be due to generator operation and\neliminates the need to account for partial orbit effects in the energy monitor.\nIn order to establish the proper time in the orbit to start motor operations a special "event\ntimer" was programmed into the system. This event timer is reset to the current integration\ntime at each orbit sunrise. It is then used in the motor operations code to determine if the\nproper delay time has been reached to start operations. The delay time, as specified in the\ntype "3" scenario input, is compared to the difference between the current GTOSS\nintegration time and the time stored in the event timer. When the proper delay time is\nreached motor operations begin.\n5.2 Analysis Results\n\nUsing the modified GTOSSDTOSS programs several different simulations were run. The\npurpose of these simulations was to assess the relationship between day/night cycling\nperiods and the perturbations introduced into the SS orbit. It was hoped that this\ninformation would provide insight into generator/motor scenarios that would minimize\norbit perturbations while still allowing efficient use of the electrodynamic tether system for\nenergy storage functions.\nFigure 5-1 illustrates how the generator/motor simulations were setup. The generator\nmode was always assumed to last throughout the shadowed portion of the orbit at a\nconstant 200 k W level. The power level, duration, and start time of the motor operations\nwere allowed to vary in each run. The time between orbital sunrise and the beginning of\nmotor operations is referred to as "delay". The delay is input to the program through the\ntype "3"generation options added to GTOSS.\nThe initial orbital scenarios analyzed have served to bracket the expected response of\nother possible scenarios for day/night operations. That is all other motodgenerator\nscenarios that are strictly dependent on day/night operation should fall within the\nperformance envelope of the scenarios analyzed. This envelope does not include those\nscenarios that allow power generation during daylight periods or motor mode operations\nduring shadowed conditions. The assumed electrodynamic tether system configuration\nconsists of two 10 km tethers attached to a 100,000 kg SS. One tether is deployed upward\nand one downward from the SS. Each tether has an end-mass of 1200 kg. The initial SS\norbit is assumed to be 500 km in altitude at an inclination of 28.5 degrees.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-35\n\n-\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n-5 Orbit Perturbation Analysis\n\n5 2 Analysis Results\n\nStari\n\nGensratu\n\nMod.\n\nstart\n\nFigure 5-1 Daymight Scenario for Orbit Analysis\nThe standard GTOSS-type day/night cycle is used as the reference operation scenario. The\nmotor mode power level is set just high enough to allow the recovery of all the energy\n"lost" in generator mode operation in the available daylight portion of one orbit. This\nconfiguration wl allow the SS power system to be sized for minimum "excess" power.\nil\nExcess power is defined as that power available during daylight periods after all SS load\nrequirements and conversion losses have been met. The current through the\nelectrodynamic tether system is limited to 40 amperes for all cases.\nComparison analyses were then done using orbits that allowed the motor mode tether\ncurrents to run at maximum levels (40 amperes) to regain the "lost" energy in a minimum\ntime. After the energy is regained the system is shutdown until the start of the next eclipse\nperiod. Variations on this theme were analyzed by delaying the start of the motor mode\noperations after orbit sunrise.\nFigures 5-2 and 5-3 present a summary of eccentricity and apogee/perigee perturbations\nproduced by the various dayhight scenarios. Three delay simulations plus the reference\nscenario are presented. The three delay times are zero, 500, 1500 seconds. This represents\nmaximum thrusting (limited by the 40 ampere maximum current) starting at orbit dawn,\n500 seconds after orbit dawn, and 1500 seconds after dawn. This latter delay results in\nmaximum thrusting occurring as late i the orbit as possible to allow all energy to be\nn\nrecovered just prior to entering the Earth\'s shadow for the next generator cycle.\nThese figures indicate that the minimum level of orbit perturbations correspond to the\ncontinuous daylight thrusting mode. The maximum perturbation roughly corresponds to\nthrusting opposite the generator drag cycle, and the d a d d u s k thrusting modes produce\napproximately the same level of variations in the orbit parameters.\n\n0\n\nIt should be noted that while these simulations only cover 10 hours, longer simulations\nhave produced similar results16.

This type of gravity model will\nproduce rotation in the line-of-apsides and over an extended period (several weeks) the\norbit geometry should change enough to start returning the orbit to its original shape.\nHowever, the orbit may be severely distorted before this can happen.\n\n5 3 Discussion of Perturbation Control Techniques\nThe analysis results discussed above allow some conclusions to be drawn about control\nstrategies for electrodynamic tether systems (ETS) being employed as energy storage\ndevices on the Space Station.\nThe basic problem with the generator/motor mode operations is that drag is produced at\napogee (which lowers perigee) and thrust is produced at perigee (which raises apogee) for\nmany orbits, at least to a first approximation. This results in an orbit with a constantly\nincreasing eccentricity, decreasing perigee altitude, and increasing apogee altitude. The\nrotation of the line-of-apsides should eventually moderate this condition, but not until\nsignificant orbital perturbations have occurred.\nModifications to the standard, constant power, scenario will produce even larger\nperturbations if the ETS is limited to generator modes during eclipses and motor modes at\nother times (this limitation seems reasonable from an efficiency standpoint).\n\n0\n\nOne approach to controlling the orbit parameters would be to introduce a generation\nperiod into the normal motor (daylight) operation time line. This would produce a drag\nforce at perigee and lower the apogee. The solar arrays would have to provide the\nrequired additional energy for this maneuver, and the tether converters may need to be\nredesigned to handle larger current flows during motor operations.\n5.4 Needed Modifications to GTOSS\n\nEarly attempts to simulate various orbit operations scenarios with GTOSS pointed out\nseveral limitations in the current version (Dl) that will need to be eliminated if this\nprogram is to be used for this type of analysis in the future. This program is amazingly\nversatile and well documented, so the changes should be relatively easy to incorporate.\nThe following is a brief list of the recommended modifications and added features.\n0\n\nAllow the environment models (gravitymagnetic fields...) to be updated at a\nfrequency other than the integration interval. It is very desireable to use the highest\nfidelity models available, but the values may not needed to be updated every\nintegration step.\n\n0\n\nLong term simulations of dayhight operations will require the position of the Sun to\nbe updated as a function of time.\n\n0\n\nA useful utility for use with GTOSS would be a program to return appropriate initial\nconditions for the reference point based on the input of classical orbital parameters.\nAnother possibilitywould be to change GTOSS to accept classical orbital\nparameters (i.e. inclination, altitude...) for initializingthe reference point.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n- 38 -\n\nContract NM9-17666\n\n5.4 Needed Modifications to GTOSS\n\n5 Orbit Perturbation Analysis\n\n0\n\nThe power generation scenarios need to be made much more general. Real orbiil\noperations simulation will need the ability to input system power requirements as a\nfunction of time and/or specific events. Event flag and/or timers will be required to\nrecord specific happenings such as; entering the Earths shadow, exiting the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nshadow, passing a certain longitudeand/or latitude on the Earth, passing a certain\norbit altitude, etc...The motor mode scenarios need to allow for non-continuous\noperation, and their duration needs to be coupled to orbiil energy changes. The\npower available for motor operations needs to be related to subsystem power\nrequirements and solar array operational parameters.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n- 39 -\n\nContract NAS9-17666\n\n6.1 IxB Control Overview\n\n6 L B Phasing for Libration Control\nU\n\n6 IxB Phasing for Libration Control\n\n0\n6.1 IxB Control Overview\n\nThe IXB control problem involves the position control of an electrodynamictether by varying\nthe current in a conducting tether.

A more fruitful approach is to use\na state variable (modem control) formulation since it permits easier examination of multivariable (multi-input, multi-output) control systems. The state vector should include the following variables which represent sensor measurements:\n(1) In-plane libration position.\n(2) In-plane libration velocity.\n(3) Out-of-plane libration position.\n(4) Out-of-plane libration velocity.\n\n( 5 ) In-orbit position of satellite.\n(6) Magnetic field strength.\nA candidate control system approach is to use a Kalman filter which provides both closed loop\nand adaptive processor compensation. The adaptive processor involves the comparison of the\nerror signal of a process model of the tether dynamics and the actual system measured\nparameters in order to adjust the control system parameters.\n\n6.4 Kalman Filter Description.\nA Kalman filter is a reasonable choice since it can be employed i a number of different modes.\nn\n\nIt can perform prediction, filtering, and smoothing of data as well as being used to solve the\nestimation, identification, and optimization control system problems. A Kalman filter\nproduces the best estimate ("best" in a minimum variance sense) of the state vector by using\nsensor measurement information. A "mean"state estimate is obtained by using "a-priori"(prior\nto available measurement) and "a- posteriori" (after a measurement is available) state\ncovariances to produce a Kalman gain. This gain is then used to weight the subsequent state\nestimates so that the difference of the predicted measurement of the process model and the\nactual system measurement data is reduced. In other words, the model begins to accurately\npredict the output measurement. In this fashion the Kalman filter permits estimation prediction) based upon measured data resulting in an optimal control strategy. Figure 6-3 illustrates\nthe basic Kalman control process.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-42\n\n-\n\nContract NM9-17666\n\n6.5 An Approach to IxB Control Studies\n\n6 IxB Phasing for Libration Control\n\n\'-4\n\nProcess\nModel\n\nEatlnu(ed Stlmulus\n\nEdlnu(.d wnnmt\n\nProcssrrNoir\nMasurennnl Noiw\n\nRocaror Enor\n\nc\n\n-f\n\nPhysical\n\nI\n\nI\n\nt\n\nI\n\nAdaptive\nProcess\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFigure 6-3 Overview of Adaptive Control Process\nSome desirable features of the Kalman filter are:\n(1) Stochastic state equation - This permits the state equation to include a random part that allows for modeling uncertainties.\n\n(2) Stochastic measurement equation - This permits the measurement equation\nto include a random part that allows for measurement accuracies or uncertainties.\n\n(3) Easily implemented into software - This permits flexibility to change algorithms and allows easy incorporation into other computer software, e.g. GTOSS,\nRTOSS.\n\n6.5 An Approach to IxB Control Studies\nWhen the control system and the tether satellite system dynamics have been incorporated into\na mathematical simulation, there are two main aspects to be studied; stability of the controlled tether system, and the efficiency of the controlled tether system.\nStability is always of concern in the development of a control system as it is an essential requirement. Because some of the dynamics of the tether system are at low frequency it may be\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n- 43 -\n\nContract NM9-17666\n\n6 IxB Phasing for Libration Control\n\n6.5 An Approach to IxB Control Studies\n\ndifficult to ascertain slow growing instabilities from short computer simulation rum. Ldnger\ncomputer rum may be necessary which are both time consuming and costly.\nOne alternative would be to use Lyapunov function analysis to examine the energy of the system for stability. However, there is always the possibility that the Lyapunov analysis may be\ninconclusive if a Lyapunov function cannot be found.\nThe effect of the control system on the useful maneuvering thrust produced by the system is\nalso of concern. An analysis needs to be performed to see how much degradation (if any) of\nthrusting results from the inclusion of a control system. The "efficiency" of the controlled system could be defined in any number of ways. One useful definition would be the ratio of the\npower used to accomplish a given maneuver using the Kalman controller and the power used\nby an uncontrolled tether.\n\nExtended Study Final Report\n\n-44-\n\nContract NM9-17666\n\nReferences\n1.
