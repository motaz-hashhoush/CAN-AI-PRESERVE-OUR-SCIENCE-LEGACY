Estimates of deforestation rates and trends are examined for different management units within the reserve and buffer zones. The satellite imagery was used to quantify and monitor rates, patterns, and trends of forest clearing during a time period corresponding to new road construction and significant human migration into the newly accessible forest region. Satellite imagery is appropriate technology in a vast and remote tropical region where aerial photography and extensive field-based methods are not cost-effective and current, timely data is essential for establishing conservation priorities.", "title": "Human Migration and Agricultural Expansion: An Impending Threat to the Maya Biosphere Reserve", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T04:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990064334, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sader, Steven"}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama A & M Univ.", "location": "Normal, AL United States"}}, "id": "29aadd669e8e4ec6b300dd9dcdbbc9bb"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19990064334, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reining, Conard"}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama A & M Univ.", "location": "Normal, AL United States"}}, "id": "3bc289681fd446ccb8aa0a77eb897f24"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19990064334, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sever, Thomas L."}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama A & M Univ.", "location": "Normal, AL United States"}}, "id": "024aa4b306fa4bb3ac7414818d8f96e2"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19990064334, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Soza, Carlos"}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama A & M Univ.", "location": "Normal, AL United States"}}, "id": "b8da00b434ab43ca8b51c7876ae61ad8"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990064334, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990064334, "id": "e221e902168145a7ba42b957869d6398", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
