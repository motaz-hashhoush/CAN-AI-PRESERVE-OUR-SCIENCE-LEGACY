When a\nRF voltage is applied to the electrodes sufficient to generate\na discharge plasma (e.g., a one-atmosphere uniform glow\ndischarge plasma) in the gas adjacent to the substrate, the\nasymmetry in the electrode configuration results in force\nbeing applied to the active species in the plasma and in turn\nto the neutral background gas. Depending on the relative\norientation of the electrodes to the gas, the present invention\ncan be used to accelerate or decelerate the gas. The present\ninvention has many potential applications, including\nincreasing or decreasing aerodynamic drag or turbulence,\nand controlling the flow of active andlor neutral species for\nsuch uses as flow separation, altering heat flow, plasma\ncleaning, sterilization, deposition, etching, or alteration in\nwettability, printability, andlor adhesion.\n\n40 Claims, 21 Drawing Sheets\n\nAIRFLOW\n\n-\\\n\n/\n\n. ..\n..\n\n/;ORWARD\nFILLER 108\nPLATE\nOAUGDP112\nPANEL\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nLINEAR AIR\nBEARING\n\nCIRCUIT BOAR\n\n110 AFT FILLER\nPLATE\n114 LEVELING SCREWS(4)\n\n,20d\nCOPPER ELECTRODE\n\nU S Patent\n\nMar. 13,2001\n\nUS 6,200,539 B1\n\nSheet 1 of 21\n\nTUNNEL\n\n106 -7\n\nCONTRACTION\n\\\n\n\\\n\n102\n\nb 1 2 4\n\n/\n\nTUNNEL\nDIFFUSER\n/\n\nAIRFLOW\n\n/\n\n-\n\n/-FORWARD FILLER 108'\nPLAT E\nOAUGDP 1 12\nPANEL\nINSU LATl NG 1\n!\nl\nSUPPORTS -8\n\n/\n\n<@\n;\n+\n\nAI\n\n'16\n\nI/\n\n'\n\n'110 AFT FILLER\n\n114 LEVELING SCREWS(4)\n122 PIEZOELECTRIC\n\nqpw\n\nLINEAR AIR 120\nBEARING\n\nFIG.

A relation among these variables is given by Equation\nBefore introducing the OAUGD plasma and the EHD\n(1) as follows:\nflow control of the present invention, however, some addi-\n\nUS 6,200,539 B1\n\n6\n\n5\nyo\n\nEKPd)\n\n(1)\n\nfor the case of a parallel-plate geometry. A planar-strip\ngeometry will have a similar but more complicated relation\ndue to the arched field lines, but the Same qualitative\nfunctional dependencies would be expected to prevail. The\nelectric field E in Equation (1) may be approximated by the\nelectrode potential (V), with E=V/d. Provided the operating\nparameters are in accordance with Equation (I), the\nOAUGD Plasma Will function at one atmosphere and Proa stable, SteadY-State glow discharge. A Plasma thickness of one or two millimeters at power densities well below\none watt Per cubic centimeter is typical for experiments\nrelated to the present invention.\nEquation ( l ) does not represent a\ntuned phenomenon and the parameters can vary over a useful range while\nmaintaining the existence and uniformity of the plasma. If\nany of the parameters deviate significantly from Equation\n(I), however, either the OAUGD plasma will cease to\nfunction, or its uniformity will degrade into a filamentary\ndischarge.\nnemagnitudes of the parameters in Equation (1) for\nbench-top demonstration of the OAUGD plasma are easily\nattainable. For instance, a frequency of several kilohertz, an\nrms voltage of several kilovolts, and a planar strip separation\ndistance of 5 or 10 mm are adequate to initiate the plasma\nat atmospheric pressure. The OAUGD plasma is not hardstarting, and does not require external initiation with a Tesla\ncoil or spark gap. While the dissipative (or plasma) current\nin the OAUGD plasma is small (about 0.030 amp rms in\nthese experiments), without special impedance matching,\nthe reactive, non-dissipative current can be large\n(approximately 0.4 amp rms) and the power source should\nbe sized accordingly.\nThe absence of any large dissipative currents due to\nfilamentary breakdown or arcing in the OAUGD plasma\nallows it to operate at low power levels, consistent with the\npossibility of net energy savings in flight boundary layer\nflow control or drag reduction applications. For example, a\ncharacteristic boundary layer viscous dissipation value for a\nlong-range commercial transport has been estimated to be\nroughly 5000 watts per square meter (Boeing 737-class\nairplane at cruise conditions). By comparison, in bench-top\ntests, the OAUGD plasma can operate with a power of 320\nW/m2 or less based on the measured, non-reactive power\nand the surface area covered by the plasma. While such a\nlow power level might not be able to effectively control a\nturbulent boundary flow at relatively high Reynolds number\nflight conditions, the energy cost of sustaining a uniform\nlayer of glow discharge plasma over a large area is nonetheless very low.\nThis low energy cost occurs for a fundamental reason: the\nOAUGD plasma is a glow discharge, created twice during\neach RF cycle. As a glow discharge, the ionization process\nin the instantaneous cathode region occurs at the Stoletow\npoint, which is about 81 electron-volts (eV) per ion-electron\npair for air. This is, in principle, the lowest possible energy\ncost of producing an ion-electron pair in a plasma source,\nand compares very favorably with the energy cost of other\natmospheric plasma sources, such as plasma torches or\narc-jets, for which the energy cost is about 10,000 eV/ionelectron pair.\nRegarding applications, the OAUGD plasma is quenched\nby liquid water, although it recovers rapidly from a water\nspray. As such, it can be used for applications in the usual\nranges of atmospheric, climatic humidity conditions, and is\nespecially applicable to dry, high-altitude applications.\nThe OAUGD plasma is fundamentally different from ion\nwind concepts that rely on a corona discharge as an ion\n\n5\n\nio\n\nis\n\n20\n\nzs\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nSO\n\nss\n\n60\n\n65\n\nsource.

This research was later abandoned, however, due to\ninability to scale the operation of the hardware to flight\nconditions. More recently, El-Khabiry and Colver were able\nto produce up to 50% or more viscous drag reduction in very\nlow Reynolds number flows (on the order of ~OO,OOO)\nusing\na corona discharge between span-wise wires on a flat surface\nfor both DC and low-frequency (60 Hz) AC excitation.

Fluids, Vol.\n9, No. (1997), PP.587-599. Each Of these techniques is\nprobably limited to low\nnumber\ndue\nto limitations on scaling the corona discharge effect to higher\nflow velocities. The OAUGD plasma, however, is more\nreadily scalable and has the potential to function at much\nhigher Reynolds numbers.\nWith an eficient Source of surface plasma, the challenge\nbecomes how to effect a useful EHD flow control mechanism in a boundary layer, particularly a turbulent boundary\nlayer. Initial investigations were aimed at understanding the\nbasic response of a boundary layer to several simple, planar\nelectrode configurations that can be used to produce the\nOAUGD plasma. These consist of stream-wise and spanwise arrays of flush-mounted strip electrodes on a flat panel,\nall at the same RF potential and phase with respect to a\nground plane or electrode on the opposite side of the panel.\nExperimental Apparatus\nLow-speed wind tunnel tests of panels with the OAUGD\nplasma were conducted in the NASA Langley 7x11 Inch\nLow Speed Wind Tunnel to determine the basic response of\nboundary layer flow to the plasma for a few simple panel\nconfigurations. The 7x11 wind tunnel is a closed return,\nunpressurized air facility with a test section 178Hx279Wx\n914L millimeters. A305x279 millimeter central portio of the\nlower test section wall was used for testing. Tests included\nthe directly measured viscous drag of flat plate panels with\nthe OAUGD plasma generated on the surface, vertical\n(wall-normal) boundary layer pitot pressure profiles measured a short distance downstream of the panels, and smoke\nflow visualization tests.\nFIG. 1 shows a cross-sectional schematic view of the test\nsection of the 7x11 wind tunnel, with its air-bearing drag\nbalance. As shown in FIG. 1, the test section is located\nbetween the tunnel contraction 102 and the tunnel diffuser\n104 with airflow from left to right. The test section is defined\nbetween an upper plate 106 ,on the top, and forward and aft\nfiller plates 108 and 110 separated by the OAUGD plasma\npanel 112, on the bottom.

They consist of brass-ball\nutility chains (commonly used for light switch pull chains,\netc.) and were chosen for their extreme flexibility, electrical\nconductivity, and lack of any sharp, corona-producing features. By exerting equal and opposite horizontal forces on\nthe drag balance, the forces due to the power leads approximately cancel out.

The data reported here are for unoptimized electrode geometries. It is anticipated that with additional modeling studies, geometrical optimization will\nincrease the magnitude of the effects reported at a given set\nof plasma operating parameters. In addition, the electrodes\nin this study were energized with a single phase of RF\nexcitation. This produces EHD body forces which are the\nresult of averaging attractive and repulsive forces over the\nRF cycle, a second-order effect. Much stronger effects\nshould be possible when adjacent electrodes are excited with\npolyphase RF power, providing a DC electric field parallel\nto the surface, a first-order EHD effect.\nIn this patent application, data are presented for three\nprincipal cases: (a) laminar data for which the wind tunnel\nflow was laminar before encountering the panel; (b) transitional data corresponding to about 75% intermittency at the\nupstream edge of the model; and (c) fully turbulent data.\nSince the boundary layer flow was tripped upstream of the\npanel, there was actually no case of completely undisturbed\nlaminar flow. At low tunnel velocities, however, the flow\nwas laminar (but with occasional unsteady oscillations) as\nevidenced by smoke-wire path-line visualization and the\nabsence of any turbulent breakdown in diagnostic hot-wire\nsignals.\nRepresentative results from a panel with symmetric\nelectrodes, each electrode a copper strip 0.5 mm wide with\ncenters spaced 10.5 mm apart, are shown in FIG. 5a for the\nstream-wise electrode orientation (Panel C7-A), and in FIG.\n5b for the span-wise electrode orientation (Panel C7-C).\nEach of these shows the expected power-law Reynolds\nnumber dependence for the \xe2\x80\x9cplasma off\xe2\x80\x99 condition. Note the\nchange in slope of the \xe2\x80\x9cplasma off\xe2\x80\x99 curve in FIG. 5a or 5b\nin the range of 7-8 mis, corresponding to transition from\nlaminar to turbulent flow. For the \xe2\x80\x9cplasma on\xe2\x80\x9d stream-wise\nelectrode case of FIG. 5a (with an electrode voltage of about\n4 kV rms and frequency of about 3 kHz), a substantial\nincrease in drag is observed. This is due to several factors.\nAs will be shown, the plasma excitation for velocities below\nabout 7 mis (laminar region) trips the flow to full turbulence,\npartially explaining the drag increase in that region. The\ndrag increase persists, however, to the highest attainable\nvelocity of the wind tunnel indicating that more than just\nflow tripping is involved. For the \xe2\x80\x9cplasma on\xe2\x80\x9d span-wise\nelectrode case of FIG. 5b (with an electrode voltage of about\n4 kV rms and frequency of about 3 kHz), a smaller drag\nincrease is produced and only in the laminaritransitional\nregion. The difference in behavior between the two cases\nalong with evidence presented later in this specification\nsuggests the formation of strong, EHD-driven, stream-wise\nvertical structures in the boundary layer for the stream-wiseoriented electrode case of FIG. 5a.\nThe very small differences in surface configuration among\ndifferent panels did not measurably affect (beyond the intrinsic precision of the data) the drag for the unenergized panels\nreported in this specification. Despite the small roughness\nintroduced by the copper electrodes on the panel surfaces,\nrelative to the energized cases, the unenergized models\nbehaved as smooth flat plates.\nIt was observed that when the panels with electrode\norientations parallel to the flow were energized, the presence\n\nof the OAUGD plasma was a strong promoter of full\nboundary layer turbulence. If the flow was laminar at the\npanel leading edge, energizing the plasma for either the\nspan-wise or stream-wise electrode case would trip the flow.\nThis is illustrated in FIGS. 6a and 6b, smoke-wire visualizations at a height of 5 mm of the flow over Panel C7-A(the\nstream-wise electrode counterpart of Panel C7-C shown in\nFIGS. 2 and 4). FIG. 6a shows the smoke-wire path-lines for\na stream velocity ( U ) of 4 mis at a height of 5 mm above\nthe surface (uiU -0.65). The panel is energized at about 3\nkHz and about 3 kV rms. The convergence of the smoke\npath-lines toward the electrodes, the apparent subsequent\nformation of vertical structures, and the breakdown into\nturbulence are all clearly evident. FIG. 6b shows the same\nconditions as FIG. 6 4 but at a higher electrode voltage of 5\nkV rms. Because of the higher electric field at this voltage,\nthe vortical structures develop sooner, are more compact,\nand break down sooner. The presence of the plasma generated by the symmetric electrode configuration constitutes a\nvery strong tripping mechanism.\nFIG. 6c shows the smoke path-lines for the case of a\nsingle, isolated stream-wise electrode above a planar lower\nelectrode. The electrode strip is 0.5 mm wide. The velocity\nis 4 mis and the wire height in this case is 2 mm. Near the\nleading tip of the electrode, the smoke path-lines appear\ninitially to symmetrically converge towards the electrode,\nforming counter-rotating vortical structures which quickly\nbecome turbulent. This process occurs along the length of\nthe electrode, giving rise to the spreading effect observed.\nFIG. 6c is further evidence of strong EHD forces in play.\n(Also observed in FIG. 6c are quasi-two-dimensional wave\ncrests upstream and to the sides of the vortical structures.\nThese waves were also present without the plasma, and are\npresumed to be laminar instability waves (TS waves) associated with other flow disturbances, e.g., the disturbances\ninput by the boundary layer trip upstream of the test section\nor even the smoke wire itself. They have no significant\nrelation to the EHD forcing or stream-wise vortical structure\nformation.) For each of the early plasma panels, it was\nobserved that a small electrostatic drag (by comparison with\nthe viscous drag usually measured) was observed, which is\nunrelated to the flow. This drag is induced by electric field\nlines terminating on the panels with or without a plasma\npresent, and is present even in the absence of a flow. This\nelectrostatic drag arises from the electrodynamic stress\ntensor, in which the electric field lines can be visualized as\nacting in tension between the panel electrodes and the\ngrounded surroundings, producing an electrostatic pressure\nand an rms average force on the panel. The measured drag\nshould be (and was) corrected for this electrostatic, nonflow-related drag. The electrostatic drag (or electrostatic\npressure) follows a quadratic relationship between the\napplied rms excitation voltage and measured drag.\nFIG. 7 is a representative plot of the electrostatic drag\nforce for Panel C1-B as a function of electrode voltage for\na frequency of 1.5 kHz and U =O. By replacing metallic\nwith non-metallic surfaces near the panel and drag balance,\nthe magnitude of the electrostatic drag shown in FIG. 7 was\nreduced to insignificant levels in the more recent data. All\ndrag data presented in this specification were corrected for\nelectrostatic drag when it was above the resolution of drag\nmeasurements (about 10 milligrams).\nVertical boundary layer velocity profiles were also measured with a total pressure probe on several panels with\nsymmetric as well as asymmetric electrode configurations.\nFIGS.

The probe tip was\nlocated approximately one boundary layer thickness downstream of the model over the smooth aft filler plate of the\nlower wall (i.e., 28 mm downstream of the panel aligned\ndirectly between two adjacent electrodes). A metallic aft\nplate was used for the profile measurements to aid probe\ninitial height determination; for drag measurements, a nonmetallic plate was used to minimize electrostatic drag error.\nFIGS. 9a-c present similar data, also from the stream-wise\nelectrode configuration, with the pitot probe directly behind\none of the stream-wise electrodes (i.e., 28 mm downstream\nof the panel aligned directly behind an electrode). FIGS.\nloa-c show the profiles downstream of span-wise oriented\nelectrodes on Panel C7-C, at 3 kHz and 5.0 kV rms with the\npitot tube located 28 mm downstream of the last electrode.\nThe profiles for the stream-wise case (FIGS. Sa-c and\n9a-c) show a dramatic alteration of the flow due to interaction with the alasma that diminishes with increasing\na\nvelocity. There is a large acceleration of the flow near the\nwall and a retardation farther out. The cases of the probe\nbetween and behind the electrodes are qualitatively similar,\nbut differ in magnitude. Smoke-wire (e.g., FIGS. 6a-b) and\nhot-wire diagnostics show that the energized, stream-wise\nelectrode patterns effectively trip the flow, and that any\nbetween-electrode/behind-electrode differences are largely\nmixed out at the end of the panel. For the span-wise case in\nFIGS. lOa-c, the effect is largely limited to the laminar flow\ncondition, with little effect in the transitional case and\nvirtually no discernible effect in the turbulent case. (The\nstep-wise appearance of the data in FIG. 10a is an error due\nto a mismatch between the pressure sensor and A/D converter ranges. The trend of the data is valid.)\nThe profiles corroborate the drag and smoke-wire data.\nFor the stream-wise electrode case, there is a substantial\nretardation of the profile affecting the entire boundary layer.\nThis increases the boundary layer momentum deficit and\nqualitatively corresponds to the large increase observed in\nthe drag in FIG. 5a. For the span-wise electrode configuration shown in FIGS. lOa-c, a significant effect is evident\nonly in the laminar regime, with a similar effect on the drag\n(FIG. 5b). For the smoke-wire flow visualization, the eruption of vortical structures observed in FIGS. 6a and 6b\nappears to be consistent with the flow retardation observed\nin the velocity profiles of FIGS. Sa-c and 9a-c.\nFIG. 11 shows the instantaneous RF voltage and current\nfor Panel C1-C operated at an rms voltage of 1.4 kilovolts\nand a frequency of 2.5 kilohertz. The voltage was measured\nat the power supply output with a high-voltage probe having\nthe requisite frequency response. The current through the\nhigh-voltage power cable was measured with a highbandwidth, toroidal current transformer with a sensitivity of\n1 voltiamp. The noisy region at the positive peaks of the\ncurrent waveform represents the plasma initiation, during\nwhich a classical, \xe2\x80\x9cDC,\xe2\x80\x9d normal glow discharge briefly\nexists between the electrodes. The plasma ignition appears\nonly once per cycle for the model and conditions portrayed\nin FIG. 11. For most models studied during these tests,\nhowever, plasma ignition occurred twice per cycle. There\nwas a noticeable variability in the current waveforms for the\nvarious panels and excitation voltages.\nA final observation applicable to all of the current\nOAUGD plasma flat panels relates to acoustics. Each panel\nexhibited a strong audible tone at the RF excitation frequency. The tone was present in unconfined bench-top\ntesting of the panels as well as in the enclosed wind tunnel\n\ntest section, ruling out any resonant chamber effects. It was\ninitially suspected that the OAUGD plasma might be exciting a panel resonance. However, monolithic mounting of the\npanel to its baseplate did not appreciably change the pitch or\nintensity of the tone. The emitted sound therefore must be\nconsidered a direct coupling of the OAUGD plasma formation mechanism into radiated acoustic energy, a further\nindication of strong plasma-neutral gas coupling.\nDrag Reduction Data\nProbably the most interesting data taken during this study\nwere those from the asymmetric panels which were designed\nto unidirectionally accelerate the flow. The smoke-flow\nvisualization of FIGS. 6a and 6b with symmetric electrodes\nindicate an attraction of the flow toward the electrodes. If the\nelectrodes are fabricated in an asymmetric manner, such as\nthe geometry illustrated in FIG. 3b, an unbalanced paraelectric EHD body force is exerted on the plasmaiflow field, and\na corresponding force is exerted on the panel on which the\nelectrodes are mounted. (The term \xe2\x80\x9cparaelectric\xe2\x80\x9d refers to\nthe fact that the observed attraction of the smoke towards the\nelectrode is independent of the instantaneous electric polarity of the electrode. It is used in the same sense as the more\nfamiliar phenomenon of paramagnetism). The resultant\nforce can be in the direction of the airflow (co-flow) or\nopposite the free stream flow (counter-flow), depending on\nthe orientation of the electrode asymmetry.\nFIG. 12 illustrates the production of a force (thrust in this\ncase) by Panel E6-C mounted on the wind tunnel drag\nbalance, but with no flow. Due to previously mentioned\nwind tunnel modifications, the electrostatic drag correction\nis insignificant. The plasma was operated at 3.0 kilohertz and\nthe electrode spacing was 8.5 mm between the centers of\nspan-wise electrode strips each 0.5 mm wide. The asymmetric strips on the bottom of the panel were located at only\none side (downstream) of the top electrode strips. These\nbottom strips were 3.0 mm wide, and separated stream-wise\nfrom the top strip by about 0.25 mm. This is not necessarily\n(and is probably not) an optimum geometrical configuration\nto produce thrust, but nonetheless illustrates the asymmetrical force effect.\nFIG. 13 presents the drag on Panel E6-C (the same model\nused in FIG. 12) over the usual laminar, transitional, and\nturbulent velocity ranges. The plasma was operated at 3.0\nkilohertz and 4.0 kilovolts rms. The two curves corresponding to the unenergized cases are virtually coincident, and\nrepresent the smooth flat-plate reference drag data. The\nlower co-flow curve shows an (unoptimized) reduction in\ndrag comparable to the plasma-generated thrust, where the\nbottom electrode strips are located downstream of the top\nelectrode strips. The upper counter-flow curve was taken\nwith the same panel rotated 180 degrees (i.e., so that the\nbottom electrode strips are located upstream of the top\nelectrode strips) to generate a plasma-induced drag on the\nplate.\nFIG. 14 shows the difference between the plasma-on (4\nkV, 3 kHz) and plasma-off drag for the asymmetric Panel\nE6-C in both the co-flow and counter-flow velocity fields.\nNote that the ordinate of FIG. 14 is the absolute value of the\ndrag difference. For the counter-flow case, the 0.9+0.05gram drag increase is approximately constant across the\nspeed range of the tunnel. This indicates that the plasmainduced, counter-flow EHD force is additive and the effect\nis primarily propulsive. For the case of the co-flow\norientation, however, a trend exists below 10 mis indicating\na clear Reynolds number dependence. The plasma has been\nnoted in all cases to trip the boundary layer so the Reynolds\nnumber dependency shown in FIG. 14 could be more\n\ns\n\nio\n\nis\n\n20\n\nzs\n\n30\n\n3s\n\n40\n\n4s\n\nSO\n\nss\n\n60\n\n65\n\nUS 6,200,539 B3\n\n13\n\n14\n\nboundary layer trip related than turbulence modification\nrelated. Nonetheless, this finding along with other data\npresented in this specification point to the possibility of\nusing the newly discovered EHD forcing to target and\ncontrol boundary layer turbulence.\nPanel E6-C was not optimized for the EHD force. While\nthe predominant plasma forms on the upper surface over the\nlower surface electrode, flow visualization has shown that a\nsmall amount of plasma forms on the opposite edge of the\nupper surface electrode due to field lines wrapping around to\nthe lower electrode. The net effect is to have a large EHD\nforce in one direction (downstream in the co-flow case) and\na smaller force in the opposite direction.\nThe asymmetric Panel E6-C was mounted in the wind\ntunnel without flow, but with the pitot tube positioned at the\nsame location used in FIGS. 8-10, The resulting blowing\nvelocity profiles are shown in FIG. 15 for electrode voltages\nof 3, 4,and 5 kV rms (all at 3 kHz). Maximum plasmainduced velocities up to 4.0 meters/sec were observed.\nParticularly interesting were the induced velocities of up to\n0.5 meters/sec at distances at least 3 cm from the wall, which\noccurred for all driving voltages.\nFIGS. 16a and 16b show the influence of the OAUGD\nplasma on a laminarjet of smoke injected in still air above a\nsingle, asymmetric electrode arrangement in which the panel\nhas a single 0.5-mm wide electrode on the upper surface and\na 3-mm wide lower electrode to the left. In FIG. 16a, the\nplasma is off, while, in FIG. 16b, the plasma is on with\nelectrode voltages about 4.5 kV rms and frequency 3 kHz.\nThe test was conducted in a still air chamber. The \xe2\x80\x9csmoke\xe2\x80\x9d\nin this case was actually titanium tetrachloride (a commonly\nused white flow marker chemical) injected manually in a\nslow, steady stream from a plastic squeeze bottle with a jet\nexit velocity estimated to be in the range of 1 to 2 m/s. The\nplasma is not visible in FIG. 16 due to the strong illumination required for the smoke. FIG. 16b shows the paraelectric\nforcing causing the jet to deflect towards the electrode.\nIn terms of a phenomenology, the flow of the smoke and\nthe air which it marks responds to paraelectric EHD effects\nin the following way. In FIG. 16b, the flow is drawn\ndownward by a low pressure above the low electric field\ngradient region of the plasma, entrained in the ion-driven\nplasma flow toward the region of high electric field gradient,\nand forced outward by the region of high (plasma\nstagnation) pressure along the surface of the panel. The flow\nis rapidly accelerated away from the region of high gas\npressure and high electric field gradient (primarily to the left\nof the electrode due to the asymmetry but also to a lesser\ndegree to the right as well). This effect is responsible for the\nblowing velocity profiles illustrated in FIG. 15.\nThe behavior shown in FIG. 16b is consistent with a pure\nparaelectric effect on the plasma and on the flow which it\nentrains. It is not a classical case of dielectrophoresis,\nalthough similarities exist. Dielectrophoresis refers to the\nforces on neutral, polarizable, dielectric material when subjected to a spatially non-uniform or a time-varying electric\nfield. In the current case, no smoke or air movement is\nobserved until sufficient voltage is reached for the plasma to\ninitiate. This indicates a different phenomenon than dielectrophoretic behavior alone.\nAccuracv of Experimental Data\nThe primary experimental data measured during this\ninvestigation were pressure (for velocity) and force (for\ndrag). Pressures were measured with capacitive or piezoelectric transducers with better than 0.1% accuracy and read\non 5% digit digital voltmeters with an order of magnitude or\nbetter accuracy than the pressure transducers. Given addi-\n\ntional sources of error such as the data reduction model,\nprobe alignment and position, probe viscous effects, and\nelectronic voltage offsets and noise, the overall accuracy is\nstill estimated to be within no more than 22% of the actual\nvalue, which was adequate for the current tests. The force on\nthe drag balance was measured with an elastic piezoresistive\nforce sensor with two active resistor elements. Two passive\nresistors were added to complete a bridge circuit. The bridge\noffset was amplified, filtered with a 4th-order Butterworth\nlow-pass filter at 0.5 Hz, and calibrated against an applied\nstream-wise force. The resultant resolution was about 10\nmilligrams. The absolute, systematic error is estimated to be\nless than 5% of the actual value and much better for\ncomparative measurements.\nDiscussion\nThe goals of the study leading to the present invention, as\ndiscussed in the introduction, were to demonstrate that EHD\nforces could be generated of sufficient magnitude to alter\nwall turbulence and drag, and to demonstrate that such\nforces can lead to a useful control mechanism. The first goal\nwas clearly met, and was limited only by the voltage of the\npower supply. The latter must also be considered a success,\nsince it has been demonstrated that EHD forcing can generate significant body forces on the neutral gas flow. The\nusefulness of the flow forcing demonstrated thus far will of\ncourse depend upon application-specific studies. Also, the\nlikelihood that the observed paraelectric behavior is a\nsecond-order effect compared to polyphase electrode excitation holds further hope for useful engineering applications.\nSeveral key questions were addressed by the diagnostics\nconducted during this study. The cause of the dramatic drag\nincrease which occurs for the symmetric stream-wise electrode arrays (FIG. 5a) is clearly associated with formation of\nthe symmetric stream-wise vortical structures evidenced by\nboth the smoke wire flow visualization (FIG. 7)and the pitot\ntube velocity profiles (FIGS. 8 and 9). Conversely, the much\nsmaller drag increase associated with the symmetric, spanwise arrays (FIG. 5b) results from the lack of stream-wise\nvortex formation and advance tripping of the turbulent\nboundary layer on the panel. For the case of the asymmetric\nspan-wise electrode panels (e.g., Panel E6-C), the directed\nthrust leading to a drag increase or decrease results from the\nsame mechanism that causes the vortex formation in the\nstream-wise, symmetric case. This is clear from the still air\nsmoke flow visualization (FIG. 16) and the no-flow blowing\nprofiles (FIG. 15).\nThe possibility of a local wall-heating mechanism\ndeserves closer attention, but is not a primary mechanism\nresponsible for the observed model behavior. The OAUGD\nplasma is not a high-energy density plasma, and does not\ngenerate a great deal of heat. Power input levels to the\nplasma were no more than about 100 mW/cm2, based on the\nelectrode array area. After several minutes of operation the\npanels become sensibly warm to the touch but certainly not\nenough to explain any of the dramatic changes in drag,\nvelocity profiles, or smoke flow patterns. A cursory measurement of boundary layer temperature downstream of an\nenergized model showed only a small temperature rise of\nseveral degrees Celsius. A more pertinent question would be\nthe magnitude of the localized electron temperature within\nthe plasma and its impact on the observed phenomena.\nFIGS. 8 and 9 show that the effect on the plasma is spread\nacross the entire boundary layer for the stream-wise symmetric electrode case. It seems clear that a major vortexdominated mechanism is in play. This is evidenced by direct\nmanipulation of the stream-wise flow by EHD forces in the\n(initially) laminar smoke wire data shown in FIG. 6.\n\ns\n\nio\n\nis\n\n20\n\nzs\n\n30\n\n3s\n\n40\n\n4s\n\nSO\n\nss\n\n60\n\n65\n\nUS 6,200,539 B3\n\n15\n\n16\n\nA strong paraelectric EHD effect on boundary layer flow\nhas been demonstrated, and opens the way to refinements\nand new configurations which may lead to useful applications. Specific active control includes either accelerating the\nflow in a steady fashion, or oscillating the flow in the\nspan-wise direction. Oscillating a turbulent boundary layer\nin the span-wise direction can have a dramatic effect on\nreducing turbulence intensity and drag. While control of\nwall turbulence and drag was the subject of the current\nstudy, other possibilities in areas such as heat transfer, lift\nenhancement, and flow separation control are also of interest. The EHD approach of the present invention has the\nability to move a neutral gas with EHD forcing to reduce or\nenhance drag, or significantly alter the velocity profile of the\nboundary layer.\nParaelectric Gas Flow Accelerator\nThe above-described research has led to the development\nof a conceptual understanding of, and an analytical theory\nfor, an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) method of neutral gas\nflow control. This paraelectric EHD body force arises when\nthe applied RF electric fields act on the net charge density of\nthe OAUGD or other plasma, to provide a body force on the\nplasma capable of accelerating the neutral gas to velocities\nup to, for example, 10 meters per second. The theory of this\nmethod is outlined below. It may be used to provide\nlightweight, robust, and laminar flow pumping by electrohydrodynamically manipulating atmospheric plasmas and\ntheir neutral background gas. This electrohydrodynamic\nflow control mechanism has been demonstrated to work at\none atmosphere using the OAUGD plasma for its\nimplementation, although other types of plasmas and other\npressures might also work.\nThe EHD effects are best studied with an individual\nparticle rather than a continuous fluid formalism. One theoretical approach to understanding the EHD effects required\nfor flow control is the Lorentzian formalism, in which each\ncollision of the ions or electrons gives up to the neutral\nbackground gas all the momentum and energy which they\ngained, on the average, from the electric field since their last\ncollision. Another conceptual aid to understanding EHD\nphenomena is to utilize the fact that electric field lines\nterminate on free charges, or on charged conductors, and that\nthese electric field lines act like rubber bands in tension to\npull charges of opposite sign together.\nIn plasmas, including the OAUGD plasmas, that give rise\nto flow control effects, this polarization electric field causes\nthe charges, the plasma, and the background gas to move\ntoward regions with shorter electric field lines and stronger\nelectric fields, i.e., the plasma will move paraelectrically\ntoward increasing electric field gradients, and drag the\nneutral gas along with it as a result of the very frequent\nion-neutral and electron-neutral collisions. In such atmospheric Lorentzian plasmas as the OAUGD plasma, the large\nratio of neutrals to ions does not \xe2\x80\x9cdilute\xe2\x80\x9d the momentum lost\nby the ions, because the large number of collisions per\nsecond compensates for the small ionization fraction.\nIn atmospheric air, the ion collision frequency is about 7\nGHz; that of electrons about 5 THz. These high collision\nfrequencies are why the electric fields are well coupled to the\nneutral gas through the ionielectron populations, and why\nthe induced neutral gas velocities can be comparable to the\nion mobility drift velocity.\nParaelectric Gas Flow Control\nThe paraelectric EHD body force arises when the applied\nelectric fields act on the net charge density of the OAUGD\nplasma, to provide a body force on the plasma capable of\naccelerating the neutral gas to velocities up to, for example,\n\n10 meters per second. A derivation of this mechanism is\npresented in the following.\nThe electrostatic body force F, on a plasma with a net\ncharge density pu is given by Equation (2) as follows:\nS\nF,=p,E\n\nnewtons/m3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E is the electric field strength in volts per meter. The\nnet charge density pu is given by Equation (3) as follows:\n10\n\npU=e(Zn,-n,)\n\ncoulombs/m3\n\n(3)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge of an electron, Z is the\naverage charge state of the ions, nt is the ionic number\ndensity, and n, is the electron number density. The net\n1s charge density pu, which is expressed in coulombs per cubic\nmeter of plasma, is the difference between the ionic and\nelectron number densities, and is a term that is usually\nignored in quasineutral theoretical formulations. This net\ncharge density is related to the electric field in the plasma\n20 through Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s equation, which is presented in Equation\n(4) as follows:\n(4)\n\n2s\n\n30\n\n3s\n\nwhere et is the electrical permittivity of free space.\nIf Equation (4) is substituted into Equation (2), the\nelectrostatic body force F, is given by Equation (5) as\nfollows:\n\nThe last two terms in Equation (5) are an equality for the\none-dimensional formulation of interest in the present application. The expression in the parentheses in the last term of\nEquation (5) is the electrostatic pressure p given by Equa,\ntion (6) as follows:\n\n40\n\n1\np - -&,E\xe2\x80\x9d newtons/m2\n\xe2\x80\x9c-2\n\n4s\n\nso\n\n()\n6\n\nwhich is numerically and dimensionally the energy density,\nas well having the units of newtons per square meter, or\npressure. In the present formulation, it is more useful to\nregard PE as a pressure, because of its influence on the\nneutral gas flow. Using Equation (6), Equation (5) may be\nwritten as Equation (7) as follows:\nd\nFE = - ( p ~ ) newtons/m2\n\n(7)\n\ndX\n\n5s\n\n60\n\n65\n\nThe body force represented by Equation (7) results because\nthe electrostatic pressure is transmitted to the ions and\nelectrons by acceleration in the electric field, and the\nmomentum acquired by the ionielectrons is then transmitted\nin turn to the neutral gas by Lorentzian collisions.\nThe physical processes responsible for making the electrostatic pressure effective can be visualized with the aid of\nFIG. 17, which shows a slab plasma confined between\nparallel plates. This slab plasma will polarize in the manner\nindicated, resulting in a polarization electric field in the bulk\nof the plasma in which the electric field lines terminate on\nthe charges at the plasma boundary.

By using PGFGs to\ncreate stream-wise oriented vortices close to the flow\nboundary, high-speed fluid outside of the boundary layer is\nbrought close to the wall to accelerate flow in that region.\nThe effect of this on a retarded flow close to the wall under\nadverse pressure gradient conditions is to reduce the tendency of the flow to separate or prevent flow separation\naltogether.\nFlow separation control on airfoils (including airplane\nwings, propeller blades, and compressor vanes) and gas\ncompressor or engine nacelle inlets or other aerodynamic\nbodies by turbulent tripping of an initially laminar boundary\nlayer. A turbulent boundary layer is known to be more\nresistant to flow separation than a laminar boundary layer\nunder otherwise equivalent mean flow conditions. PGFGs\nare very effective in tripping boundary layer flow. The effect\nof this on a retarded flow close to the wall under adverse\npressure gradient conditions is to reduce the tendency of the\nflow to separate or prevent flow separation altogether.\nFlow mixing augmentation by stream-wise vortex creation. Many industrial processes including combustion rely\non the mixing of different gas streams. Stream-wise vortices\nintroduced into such streams using devices based on the\nOAUGD plasma would effectively promote mixing.\nFlow mixing augmentation by turbulent tripping of an\ninitially laminar boundary layer. Many industrial processes\nincluding combustion rely on the mixing of different gas\nstreams. Tripping initially laminar streams to turbulence\nusing devices based on the OAUGD plasma would effectively promote mixing.\nHeat transfer augmentation by stream-wise vortex creation. Heat transfer from solid boundaries to a gas is highly\ndependent upon nature of the boundary layer flow. By\nintroducing stream-wise vortices into the flow with PGFGs,\nhotter (or colder) fluid in the stream away from the wall is\nbrought close to the colder (or hotter) surface thereby\npromoting more heat transfer.\nHeat transfer augmentation by turbulent tripping of an\ninitially laminar boundary layer. Heat transfer from solid\nboundaries to a gas is highly dependent upon nature of the\nboundary layer flow. By tripping of an initially laminar\nboundary layer to turbulence with PGFGs, hotter (or colder)\nfluid in the stream away from the wall is brought close to the\ncolder (or hotter) surface thereby promoting more heat\ntransfer.\nInput of any arbitrary frequency, amplitude, or shape fluid\ndisturbances into flows for the purpose of exciting specific\nfluid instability modes. Certain flows, particularly laminar\nflows, are known to exhibit various flow instabilities when\nexcited by the proper external disturbances. Such disturbances can promote flow vortices and/or turbulence.
