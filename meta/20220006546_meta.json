Because they are remotely piloted, these aircraft are expected to utilize increasing aircraft automation and autonomy, require special infrastructure accommodations for navigation, communication, command and control and potentially need special treatment from air traffic control. In order to assess the accessibility and impacts of these operations across the national airspace, this preliminary study investigates current and estimated future demand for air cargo operations in the continental United States. Air cargo demand is broken down by aircraft type and airport categories to produce a rough nation-wide classification of cargo operations. Then, the state of Texas is investigated as a focus region, where the impacts of regional cargo unmanned aircraft systems on the airspace are investigated in further detail. The potential technologies that can assist in regional cargo unmanned aircraft system accessibility are defined at airports across the focus region. A single airport, Fort Worth Alliance, is highlighted to discuss airport-level statistics. Finally, a qualitative classification of airports by the type of cargo operations is suggested.
