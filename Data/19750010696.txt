Lamar, Technical Monitor\n\n2\n\n6hn R.VBrrfikmann, Chief\nPhotographic Technology Division\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAt the request of the Photographic Technology Division chief, Mr.\nJohn R. Brinkmann, an investigation was undertaken to identify\nthose Photographic Laboratory by-products which can produce harmful reactions if released untreated.\n\nAfter identification of these\n\nby-products, specific monitoring systems for each of the offending\nions were investigated and recommendations for implementation have\nbeen made.\n\nAppropriate monitoring systems have been discussed\n\nand commercial suppliers of monitoring equipment have been contacted for further information.\n\ni\n\nSECTION I\n\nIdentification of Harmful Chemicals\n\nIn the mixed effluent from a processing laboratory, the following\nchemicals may occur and produce harmful results.\n\nFerrocyanide-\n\nBleach by-products produced by\nthe reduction of ferricyanide in\ncolor bleaches.\n\nIn the presence\n\nof sunlight and oxygen, free,\ncyanide is produced from ferrocyanide.\n\nDichromate Compounds- Hexavalent chromium is present\nwhen dichromate bleaches are\nutilized.\n\nThis ion is harmful\n\nto fish in small concentrations.\n\nSilver-\n\nThe free silver ion is\nmmicro-organisms.\n\ntoxic to\n\nMost silver in\n\nphotographic processing waste is\nin the form of a silver thiosulfate which can be readily\nrecovered or converted to silver\nsulfide.\n\nPhosphates and\nNitrates-\n\nThese chemicals are plant nutrients\nwhich contribute to algae and weed\ngrowth.\n\n.4\n\nBoron-\n\nIn high concentration, boron\ncan be toxic to plants.\n\nSECTION II\n\nMeasurement and Monitoring Methods\n\nFerrocyanide -\n\nFerricyanide and ferrocyanide which are the main\nions present in the effluent are not themselves\nespecially toxic.\n\nIt is the cyanide which is\n\nreleased when they decompose that is toxic.\n\nTo\n\nmonitor the cyanide on a continuous basis, a\ncomplicated and ingenious procedure and equipment\nhave been devised. First, it is necessary to pretreat the effluent to release the metal-cyanide\nbonds before measurement.\n\nAfter a double-stage\n\npretreatment, the free cyanide in the sample can\nbe measured using a specific monitoring electrode\nfor the cyanide ion.\nThis entire sampling procedure can be performed\non a continuous basis by using commercially\navailable monitoring devices such as the one\ndescribed in the attached brochure.\n\nSuch devices\n\nincorporate continuous strip chart recorders and\nalarm systems to signal when a preset level of\ncyanide is exceeded.\n\nSilver -\n\nThe measurement of silver can be complicated by\nhypo and other interferring ions.\n\nIt may be\n\npossible to make the measurement directly or it\nmay be necessary to pretreat with some reagent\nHowever, these are both standard\nsuch as KA (NO 3 ).\ng\nchemical procedures used for silver measurement and\ncan be performed easily by the type of monitoring\ngear described in the attached brochure.\n\n3\n\nPhosphate -\n\nA possible method may be to treat the sample with\nlanthanum nitrate and then sodium fluoride.\n\nThe\n\nmeasurement is then made on the remaining fluoride\nions using a specific fluoride monitor.\nNitrate -\n\nnitrate is expected in the effluent,\n\nVery little\nbut it\n\ncan be measured after pretreatment with\n\nsilver sulfate to remove interferring ions.\nSpecific electrodes for nitrate can then be used.\nBoron -\n\nThis will be the most difficult ion to measure.\nbest method is to treat with\n\nThe\n\nhydrofluoric acid to\n\nform tetrofluoroborate, for which specific ion\nelectrodes exist.\nChromates -\n\nNot much trouble is to be expected from the chromates,\nas they would quite likely be reduced to a less\ntoxic form by the hypo, sulfate, and developing\nagent present. It is not expected that chromate\n-monitoring will be required.\n\nMonitoring of all of these ions is possible utilizing chemical pretreatment and specific ion sensors.\n\nIn practice, a small portion\n\nof the Building 8 effluent would be continuously diverted to run\nthrough a set of specific monitors to analyze and record the levels\nof the harmful chemicals.\n\nIntegral alarm systems can be set to\n\nsignal excessive ion levels,\n\nThese same alarm systems could be\n\nutilized to trigger electronic circuits which could divert the flow\ninto holding tanks or treatment facilities,\n\n4.\n4i\n\nSECTION III\n\nACTION TAKEN\n\nArrangements are being made with Eastman Kodak Company\nto discuss monitoring equipment requirements, ion levels and\n1.\n\n1.\n\nmonitoring techniques.\n\n2.\n\nContact has been made with the representatives of monitor-\n\ning equipment manufacturers for discussions about available equipment,\ncosts and effectiveness. Orion and Leeds and Northrup have both\nbeen contacted.\n\nThey are working on the problem and will send\n\npepresentatives to visit our facility.\n\n3.\nspecific\n\nAfter the above requested information has been analyzed,\ncontainrecommendations for monitoring systems and automatic\n\nment systems will be made.\n\n5\n\nORION RESEARCH\n\nmonitoring\nsystems\n(. -:-\'-\n\ni: - :\n\nSERIES 1000 MONITORS\na major technical breakthrough\n\nin continuous measurement of chemical parameters\n\nimpedance\namplifier\n\nautonjtic\n\nec\n\nstandad\nSizatlon\n\nronic\n\ntereratu\n1cot(ol\n\nJstrip\nchart\nrecorder\n\n-\n\n-\n\nSeries 1000 monitors are single parameter continuous\nanalyzers built to perform in the rigorous environment of the\nindustrial plant. The system is housed in a rugged NEMA 12\ncase, and the critical sensing assembly is electronically\nthermostatted to allow the actual measurement to be made\nunder "laboratory conditions".\nasysten sample for the monitor is provided by a by-pass\nfiltration\nsystem which requires a minimum of attention,\nReduced operating costs result from low in-operation reagent\nconsumption, and a stand-by mode keeps the monitor in\ncomplete operational readiness whenever the process stream\n\nlarrm\ncircul\n\nI 5A SPD1\n\nconverter\n- board\n\nEach day the electronic package automatically checks\nthe system calibration on a standard solution, corrects any\nerror, and indicates proper operation.\nThe electronics package includes a 4-inch strip chart recorder.\nand a dual set-point indicating meter for establishing high\nand low alarm limits. (The meter allows the level measured\nto be read at a glance, and shows where the limits\nhave been\nset.) An optional current converter board can be\nplugged\ninto the electronics package to interface the monitor to\nprocess control apparatus.\n\nis shut down.\nThe electronic and mechanical design is simple and modular\n- so that reliability is maximized and servicing can be\ndone\nwith little more than a screwdriver.\n\nORIGAL PAGE\nOF PUOPR QTJALrjj IS\n\nrugged, reliable hardware\n\nelectronics that do\n\na lot more than Just measure\n\nparameter\nmeasured\n\nlimit of\ndetection\n(ppm)\n\nammonia\n\n0.02\n\nbromide\ncadmium\nchloride\nchlorine\ncopper\n\n0.05\n0.02\n1.00\n0.05\n0.05\n0.05\n0.06\n0.05\n0.01\n0.05\n0.10\n0.20\n0.60\n0.05\n0.05\n0.05\n\ncyanate\n% cyanide\nfluoride\nhardness\nhypochlorite\niodide\nlead\nnitrate\nnitrite\noxidizing agents\nreducing agents\nBecause of their many advantages over older analytical techniques, methods using\nOrion chemical sensing electrodes are in daily use in thousands of laboratories\nthroughout the world. These proven electrode methods are automated in\nSeries 1000 monitors, making possible precision and sensitivity never before\navailable in continuous monitoring systems. The logarithmically-responding electrodes are both sensitive and accurate over a tremendous concentration\nrange - important information need not be lost because of off-scale readings.\nTime response is excellent, sample color and turbidity do not interfere,\nand fouling is less of a problem than with other types of detection.\n\nsodium\n\n<0.01\n\nsilver\n\n0.20\n\n%sulfide\n\n0.10\n\ntotal acid\ntotal base\n\nThe electrode methods employed in the Series 1000 monitors are easily run\nin parallel on the bench-top, greatly simplifying the verification of results.\n\nThe block diagram above shows the chemistry section of the Model 1206 cyanide\nmonitor; two reagents are used in the sample pre-treatment.Acidified EDTA is added\nto the sample (A).
