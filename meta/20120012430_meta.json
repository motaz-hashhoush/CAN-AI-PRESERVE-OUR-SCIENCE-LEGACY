Many of these glaciers over the region have been retreating, while some are advancing and stable. Other studies report that some glaciers in the Himalayas show acceleration on their shrinkage. However, the causes of the glacier meltings are still difficult to grasp because of the complexity of climatic change and its influence on glacier issues. However, it is vital that we pursue further study to enable the future prediction on glacier changes.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120012430, "id": "d7e95b995d6c48fdb4a54894bc832a29", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120012430.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120012430/downloads/20120012430.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120012430/downloads/20120012430.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120012430/downloads/20120012430.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
