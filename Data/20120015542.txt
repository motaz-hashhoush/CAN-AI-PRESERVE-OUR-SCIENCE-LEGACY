After only three releases of the initiative, a total of 66 CubeSats now await launch\nopportunities.\nSo, how is this challenge being resolved? NASA \' s Launch Services Program (LSP) has studied how to integrate PPODs on Athena, Atlas V, and Delta IV launch vehicles and has been instrumental in developing several carrier\nsystems to support CubeSats as rideshares on NASA missions. In support of the first two ELaNa missions the\nPoly-Picosatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD) was adapted for use on a Taurus XL (ELaNa I) and a Delta n (ELaNa\nIII). Four P-PODs, which contained a total eight CubeSats, were used on these first ELaNa missions. Next up is\nELaNa VI, which will launch on an Atlas V in August 2012. The four ELaNa VI CubeSats, in three P-PODs, are\nawaiting launch, having been integrated in the NPSCuLite. To increase rideshare capabilities, the Launch Services\nProgram (LSP) is working to integrate P-PODs on Falcon 9 missions. The proposed Falcon 9 manifest will provide\ngreater opportunities for the CubeSat community.\nFor years, the standard CubeSat size was 1U to 3U. As the desire to include more science in each cube grows, so\ndoes the standard CubeSat size. No longer is a 1U, 1.5U, 2U or 3U CubeSat the only option available; the new\nCubeSat standard will include 6U and possibly even 12U. With each increase in CubeSat size, the CubeSat\ncommunity is pushing the capability of the current P-POD design. Not only is the carrier system affected, but\nintegration to the Launch Vehicle is also a concern. The development of a system to accommodate not only the 3U\nP-POD but also carriers for larger CubeSats is ongoing.\nLSP considers payloads in the lkg to 180 kg range rideshare or small/secondary payloads. As new and emerging\nsmall payloads are developed, rideshare opportunities and carrier systems need to be identified and secured. The\ndevelopment of a rideshare carrier system is not always cost effective. Sometimes a launch vehicle with an excellent\nperformance record appears to be a great rideshare candidate however, after completing a feasibility study, LSP may\ndetermine that the cost of the rideshare carrier system is too great and, due to budget constraints, the development\ncannot go forward. With the current budget environment, one cost effective way to secure rideshare opportunities is\nto look for synergy with other government organizations that share the same interest.\n\nSkrobot\n\n..____\n\n--\n\n1\n\n261h Annual AIAAIUSU\nConference on Small Satellites\n\nSSC12-V-5\nA Brief History\nSince 2008 , NASA has generated an initiative which\nprovides sustainable launch opportunities for\nCubeSats. The initiative does not guarantee specific\nlaunch time frames , but does offer CubeSats the\nchance to launch . At this time, there have been two\nELaNa missions flown with three more scheduled to\nlaunch by the end of Fiscal Year 2013. Each of these\nmissions will carry anywhere from three to six PPODs. It is a tremendous accomplishment that NASA\nhas been able to open up an average of two launch\nopportunities per year to the CubeSat community\nwhere previously there had been none.\n\nThe CubeSat Initiative\nNASA \' s CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) provides\nlaunch opportunities for small satellite payloads.\nThese CubeSats are flown as auxiliary payloads on\npreviously planned missions. CubeSats are a class of\nresearch spacecraft called nanosatellites. The cubeshaped satellites are approximately four inches long,\nhave a volume of about one quart and weigh about 3\npounds .\nTo participate in the CSLI program ,\nCubeSat investigations should be consistent with\nNASA\'s Strategic Plan and the Education Strategic\nCoordination Framework . The research must address\naspects\nof science, exploration,\ntechnology\ndevelopment, education or operations. The call for\nCubeSat proposals is released each August and the\nselection process is completed in February ofthe next\nyear.\n\n#of P\nrops\nS\nubmitted\n\n#of P\nrops #M\nanWested #La\nunched\nSelected\n\nFigure I NASA CubeSat Initiative Proposals\nThe data collected can be used to help clarify where\nLSP should direct its efforts in launching CubeSats.\nThe figures show that Universities, NASA, DoD and\nthe private sector are all developing CubeSats, and\nlooking to NASA to help them launch their satellites.\nIt was anticipated that Universities would be the\nlargest responders to the CSLI because the ELaNa\nprogram is aimed at students and education .\nHowever, we are seeing an increase in the number of\nCubeSats in the both Civil and Military space. With\nthe increasing popularly of the ELaN a program, even\nthe non-profit private sector is joining the team .\n\nThe ELaNa initiative helps NASA in its pursuit of\nthree major education goals: Strengthening NASA\nand the Nation\'s future workforce; Attracting and\nretaining students in science, technology, engineering\nand mathematics (STEM) disciplines ; and Engaging\nAmericans in NASA\'s mission .\n\n#of Un tv\n\n#of NASA\n\n#of DoD\n\nt1 of Pnvate\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n12\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n9\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n\n20\n\n4\n\n7\n\n2\n\n45\n\n9\n\n13\n\n2\n\nWho is looking for a Launch?\nWith the completion of three CubeSat initiative calls,\nthere is now data which shows who is looking for a\nride and what orbit they would like to be in . From the\nthree calls, 97 proposals were received, 68 were\nselected, and , as of today, 23 have been manifested\nand 8 CubeSats have flown .\n\n45\n\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 3rd\nInitiative\n\xe2\x80\xa2 2nd\nInitiative\n\n15\n\n10 r\n5\n0 l\n# of Univ\n\n# of NASA\n\n# of DoD\n\n# of Privale\n\nFigure 2 NASA CubeSat Initiative Proposers\nThe current P-POD is designed to hold a 3U\nCubeSat, which allows a single 3U or multiple I Us,\n1.5Us or 2Us to be integrated together in one P-POD.\nLSP must take the CubeSat size into account when\nmanifesting upcoming mission s. An equal number of\n\nSkrobot\n\n2\n\n26\'h Annual AIAAIUSU\nConference on Small Satellites\n\nSSC12-V-5\nI U and 3U CubeSats were selected as a result of the\nfirst and second CSLI ca lls. The response to the third\nca ll indicates that 3Us have now become the\ndominant size for CubeSat missions. The third call\nalso produced three 6U candidates. Mapping the\ntrend, this seems to indi cate that future CSLI calls\nwil l result in more 6U CubeSat proposa ls; therefore\nthe standard 3U P-POD needs to be modified into a\nsystem that can hold twice the current vo lume of the\nCubeSats.\n1U\n\n1 SU\n\n2U\n\n3U\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n.\n9\n\n5\n\n3\n\n.\n\n20\n\n9\n\n7\n\n33\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\n0\n\n4\n\n12\n\n4\n\n15\n\n12\n\n33\n\n2\n\n35\n30\n25\n\n~\n\n\xc2\xb7 ~\n\n15\n\nlnilialive\n\n10\n5\n0\n51 degree at\n325km\n\n3\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n\n0\n\n21\n\n3\n\n23\n\n4\n\n13\n\n0\n\n4\n\nGTO\n\n3\n\n0\n\n6\n\nLEOSNon-Sun\nync\n\n5\n\n0\n\n7\n\nLEO Sun Sync\n\n0\n\nGU\n\n.\n\n51 \xe2\x80\xa2 at 325km\n\nLEO Sun\nSync\n\nLEO Non-Sun\nSync\n\nGTO\n\nFigure 4 NASA CubeSat Initiative CubeSats by\nOrbit\nOur First Success- ELaNa Ill\nAfter the loss of ELaNa I on the G lory mission the\nteam rebounded in a professional manner to focus on\nELaNa Ill. Even though telemetry showed that the\nELaNa I P-POD had functioned correctly, the ELaNa\nteam knew that the next ELaNa mission had to be a\nsuccess. ELaNa Ill was the first flight on a Delta II\nlaunch vehicle which meant that the team had to\nperform the Non-recurring engineering for the\ndevelopment of a carrier system to be mounted to the\nstruts of the second stage of the Delta II launch\nvehicle.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 3rd\n\nlnitlattve\n\xe2\x80\xa2 2nd\nlnitiatfve\n\n1U\n\n1.5U\n\n2U\n\n3U\n\n6U\n\nFigure 3 NASA CubeSat Initiative CubeSat Sizes\nOne of the most important of pieces of data col lected\nis the CubeSats requested orbit in order to perform\ntheir science. Currently the P-PODs we launch are\nauxi li ary payloads dependent upon the orbit of the\nprimary mission ; the CubeSats are restricted to the\nprimary payload \' s orbit. CubeSat teams do not have\nto change their orbit requirements in order to be\nmanifested ; however there is a better chance to fly\nsooner if they can accomp li sh their mission in a\nvariety of orbits.\n\nRAX II (University of Michigan/SR I), DICE (Utah\nState University), AubieSat-1 (Auburn University),\nExplore- ! [Prime} F2 (Montana State University) and\nMcubed/COVE (University of Michigan) were the\nfive CubeSats selected and flown in three P-PODs on\nELaNa III. After the successfu l placement of the\nprimary mission , the Delta II second stage released\nthe CubeSats in an orbit of 420kmx81 Okm at I 02\ndegrees of inclination. Once the CubeSats had been\nreleased, each of them started their system power-up\nin order to begin their mission .\nOn a typical LSP primary mission the Integration\nEngineer must manage roughly 125 to 150 lCD\nrequirements verifications.\nELaNa Ill had five\nCubeSats in three P-PODs and so the number of\nverifications required grew to we ll over 500, each of\nwhich had to be verified before the Certification of\nFli ght Readiness could be provided.\nA month before the CubeSat-integrated P-PODs were\nto be delivered to the launch provider for integration\nwith NPP , one of the universities encountered several\n\nSkrobot\n\n3\n\n26 1h Annual AIAA/USU\nConference on Small Satellites\n\nSSC12-V-5\nissues with their CubeSat, jeopardizing their place on\nthe mission . The ELaNa Ill team worked closely with\nthe CubeSat team , assisting them with anomaly\nresolution and providing rapid turnaround on lCD\nrequirements verifications. The CubeSat was verified\nready for integration and was able to remain part of\nthe ELaNa Ill mission . Just days before launch ,\nanother university determined that they had not\ncompleted all necessary licensing requirements.\nAgain, the ELaNa team was called upon and was able\nto complete the required paperwork and secure\nlicensing approval for the university . Had the\nlicensing approval not been granted, the P-POD\ncontaining that university \' s CubeSat would have\nbeen pu lied from N PP and not been part of the\nmission .\n\nFigure 5:\nDelivery\n\nOUTSat and GEMSat\n\nThe eleven CubeSats were tested and delivered to Cal\nPoly in January 2012 and final integration and testing\nof the entire OUTSat spacecraft was completed in\nFebruary 2012 . The extremely short timeline proved\nto be difficult, but was made possible by the close\nworking relationship of all the OUTSat/ ELaNa team\nmembers .\nMost of the P-POD and NPSCuL\nhardware was built by full time students taking\nclasses. As with all ELaNa missions, students are\nheavily involved in all aspects of the mission from\ndeveloping, assembling, and testing CubeSats\npayloads to working with NASA and the launch\nvehicle integration teams.\n\nELaNa VI is currently integrated on an Atlas V\nlaunch vehicle scheduled to launch in August of 2012\nand is a subset of a larger CubeSat mission called\nOUTSat. ELaNa VI consists of 4 CubeSats; CSSWE\nfrom the University of Colorado at Boulder,\nCINEMA from the University of California at\nBerkeley, CXBN from Morehead State University,\nand CPS from California Polytechnic State\nUniversity, San Luis Obispo.\nThere are seven\nadditional CubeSats from various U.S. organizations,\nwhich completes the OUTSat complement. All eight\nP-PODs are mounted into the NPSCuL structure built\nby the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey CA\nand attached to United Launch Alliance \' s Aft\nBulkhead Carrier (ABC) on the aft end of the Centaur\nupper stage.\nCal Poly and SRI International\npartnered together to lead the overall integration\neffort as the Auxiliary Payload Integrating Contractor\n(APIC). LSP partnered with the National Science\nFoundation to fly their space weather experiments,\nCSSWE and CINEMA . By leveraging partnerships\nwith other US Government agencies, NASA LSP is\nable to increase flight opportunities for educational\nCubeSats and create a unified payload rideshare\neffort within the government.\n\nGEMSat/ELaNa II , the follow on mission to\nOUTSat/ELaNa VI , will carry an additional eight PPODs worth of CubeSats on another Atlas V launch\nvehicle. The mission kicked off in the summer of\n2012.\n\nORS-3\nThe ORS-3 mtsston is unique because will carry\nsome 19 small payloads into orbit. NASA is fortunate\nto be apart of such an exciting opportunity ; LSP \' s\nELaNa IV will launch eight more educational\nCubeSat missions. The ELaNa IV CubeSats were\noriginally manifest on the Falcon CRS-2 flight. When\nNASA received word that the P-PODs on CRS-2\nneeded to be de-manifested LSP immediately started\nlooking for other opportunities to launch this\ncomplement of CubeSats as soon as possible. When\nthree additional P-POD slots became available on the\nORS-3 mission, we were able to place eight of the\nthirteen CubeSats from the de-manifested CRS-2\nflight. The other five CubeSats wi ll be placed on\nCRS-3.\n\nELaNa VI and OUTSat is the first CubeSat flight\nopportunity on an Atlas V launch vehicle and, as\nsuch , has proven to be the most challenging CubeSat\nmission thus far. OUTSat and the ELaNa VI mission\nkicked off in April of 20 II , with flight hardware\ndelivery to the launch vehicle in March 2012 .\n\nSkrobot\n\n4\n\n261h Annual AIAA/USU\nConference on Small Satellites\n\nSSC12-V-5\nCargo Resupply Services Missions\nWith the success of the first Falcon 9 Dragon flight to\nthe International Space Station, additional CubeSat\nopportunities are available.\nELaNa P-PODs are\nslated to launch on the upcoming NASA CRS\nmissions . The first mission to be manifested on a\nFalcon 9 CRS flight will be ELaNa V on CRS-3 . The\nplan is to carry up to five P-PODs per CRS mission\nto an orbit of approximately 325km circular at 51.6\ndegrees inclination . While this is not a high orbit for\na CubeSat and their life on orbit will be relatively\nshort, it will allow routine access to space for\nCubeSats. After the Dragon is released, the second\nstage will reorient and then release the CubeSats. The\ncurrent estimate for the life on orbit is roughly 30\ndays during the solar maximum period.\n\nFY14\n\nFigu re 6 Manifested Missions\nFigure 7 shows primany missions for which a launch\nvehicle has not yet been selected but which have a\nhigh probablility of supporting CubeSat-integrated PPODs. After a launch vehicle is selected, the mission\nwill then be considered for potentail CubeSat\nmissions .\n\nThe current schedule has SpaceX launching a least\ntwo CRS mission per year with the possibility of\nmore if necessary. This provides the opportunity for\nten P-PODs of CubeSats to be launched to the lower\norbit on a routine basis. This is great for CubeSat\nmissions that only need the 30 days on orbit to verify\nor demonstrate a new technology.\n\nFY12\n\nManifesting\n\nFY14\n\nIn\n\nSince the beginning of the the iniative, the\nmanifesting process for CubeSat missions has been\nvery successful. The success of the ELaNa program\nis due in large part to NASA \' s parnership with the\nDoD and NRO. These relationships have produced\n16 CubeSat missions on three different non-NASA\nsponsered primary missions.\n\nFY15\n\nAPote\n\nFY16\n\nFY17\n\ntial CRS li ghts\n\n"" ,,\n\n41td 10 14\n1 ....\n\nt\xe2\x80\xa2"lOH\n\n111/S\n\n.\n\nThe CLSI results in a list of seclected CubeSat\nmissions in priority order. LSP uses this list during\ntheir nominal manifest process. Using the priority list\nas a guide, and dependent upon the readiness date\nand orbit requirements gathered from proposals, LSP\nmanifests CubeSats on missions as opportunities\nbecome availible. Once manifested, the CubeSat\nteam is notified to determine if the selected orbit will\nmeet the requirements of the CubeSat mission. If it is\ndetermined that the orbit is not acceptible or the\nCubeSat mission will not be ready in time to support\nintegration the next mission on the list is then\ncontacted.\n\n"\n\n..\n\nFigu re 7 Mission ofOpportumttes\nThere can be Launch Delays\nBecause the CubeSat mission is a part of a primary\nmission any delays to the primary results in a delay\nfor the CubeSats. LSP discusses this with the\nCubeSat teams during their first meeting to ensure\nthat they understand the possibility of delays to the\noriginal launch date. The ELaNa I CubeSat teams\nexperienced this first hand with the Glory . Due to the\nfailure of the OCO Taurus flight, the Taurus vehicle\nhad to be evaluated to determine the cause of the\nfailure. These evaluations caused a 12 month delay in\nthe Glory mission.\n\nFrom Figure 6 you can see the CubeSat missions that\nare currently manifested and in the integration\nprocess. This is a huge accomplishment compared to\njust two years ago. CubeSat missions have become\nalmost routine and are accepted within the areospace\ncommunity, including NASA, NRO and DoD, not\nonly because they are an instrument for education but\nalso for having their own uses within each agency .\n\nSkrobot\n\nFY13\n\nAnother issue that CubeSat mtss10ns face is, as\nsecondary missions, they are the first to be removed\n\n5\n\n26 1h Annual AIAAIUSU\nConference on Small Satellites\n\n----------------------- - - - -- - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -- --\n\n- -- - - - --\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --\n\nSSC12-V-5\npath to CubeSat growth since it would have the least\namount of impact on existing CubeSat launch\nopportunities. The 6U volume cannot be supported\nby some of the current CubeSat launch capabilities,\nbut efforts like the ABC/NPSCuL, CRS, and\nORS/CubeStack launches provide opportunities to fly\n6U CubeSats. The drawback of the 6U CubeSat will\nbe an increase in the overall cost of the project,\nincluding integration to the LV and launch. NASA\nLSP and Cal Poly are currently working to integrate\nthese new 6U CubeSat Deployers onto future\nmissions, one of which is built by Planetary Systems\nCorporation. The 6U CubeSat standard is not meant\nto replace the already existing and successful I U-3U\nCubeSat standard, but to increase options for\ndevelopers IF they need extra mass and volume.\n\nif there is a mass concern. The primary mission of\nCRS flights is to deliver cargo to the ISS. If\nadditional mass is required for the cargo, the P-PODs\nmay be removed from the mission, as happened on\nCRS-2.\nHow Does the Future Look?\nWhile NASA has primarily used government launch\nvehicles to provide rides for its selected CubeSats, it\nmay be time to explore the possibility of placing\nNASA CubeSats on commercial missions. In order to\nfly on a Government Launch Vehicle, the CubeSat\nand P-POD must not increase the baseline risk to the\nprimary spacecraft or launch vehicle. To prove that\nthe CubeSats meet this requirement a tremendous\namount of extra work is required by all parties.\nAdditionally, the CubeSats are limited to orbit of the\nprimary mission; often the CubeSat teams would\nprefer a different orbit, if available. The growing\nmarket of commercial U.S. launch vehicles may give\nCubeSats an additional flight options. Also being\nconsidered is the possibility of a dedicated Nano\nLaunch system for CubeSats.\n\nSummary\nOne of NASA\'s key goals and VISions is\nstrengthening the Science, Technology, Engineering,\nand Mathematic disciplines. The CubeSat Initiative\nand the ELaN a mission are a testament to how STEM\ncan be increased within the U.S. educational system.\nFor years students were building CubeSat without the\npotential of launching. However, because of the lack\nof flight opportunities, the rate at which CubeSats\nwere being developed dramatically diminished until\nCubeSats almost vanished. When the first request for\nCubeSats, for the Glory mission, was sent out only\nsix responses were received. In the 20 II CubeSat\nInitiative Call, NASA received 43 proposals\nrequesting an opportunity to fly.\n\nSo how does ELaNa move forward? How do we fly\nCubeSats with unique requirements and orbits? How\ndo we remove the \' do no harm to the primary/launch\nvehicle\' requirement?\nHave our own Nano-Launcher. That\'s right, have\nour own dedicated launch vehicle where CubeSats\nare primary. The CubeSats would no longer have to\nabide by the restrictions levied by a primary\nrideshare. CubeSats could be placed in an orbit where\nthey can meet their science requirements sooner and\ncomplete their mission earlier, thus reducing orbital\nlife requirements. Development of a Nano Launcher\nsystem is currently underway and is expected to be\ncompleted in FY 14.\n\nWith the emergence of ELaN a, CubeSat teams know\nthat launches will be available on a routine basis to\nsupport their development efforts. Educational\nCubeSats have flown on Taurus XL and Delta II\nlaunch vehicles and are manifested to launch on Atlas\nV and Falcon 9 in the near future. This is quite an\nachievement for a community that just a few years\nago had no flight opportunities in the United States.\n\n6U CubeSat Carrier\nThe CubeSat Standard was started in 1999 by\nProfessor Bob Twiggs and Dr. Jordi Puig-Suari and\nprimarily focused on allowing academic institutions\nthe ability to build a satellite within the 2-4 year\nacademic career using available COTS components.\nWith the advancement in CubeSat complexity over\nthe past decade and the growing number of CubeSats\nperforming "real operational and scientific" missions,\nthere is the need to look at a new CubeSat form\nfactor. This added volume and mass would allow for\na much needed increase in power and propulsion\ncapability, as well as payload volume. The new 6U\nCubeSat essentially combines two 3U CubeSats side\nby side, creating an approximate I Ocm x 20cm x\n30cm volume.
