Cotter\'s m o d e l of the startup\nprocess is reassessed i n the l i g h t of these observations. The m o d e l is modified by moving the sonic\npoint t o the end of the hot zone and including the\nopposing effects of w a l l f r i c t i o n and Condensation on\nthe flow. \'Pransient measurements have been made on a\nlithium heat pipe f o r startup t o temperatures i n the\nrange 1000 t o 140O0 C. As predicted by the theory,\nthe temperature of the hot zone is f a i r l y independent\nof the power input t o the evaporator u n t i l the hot\nzone reaches the end of the pipe. The hot zone\ntemperature predicted by the theory is 50 t o 8 \xc2\xb0 C\n0\nhigher than the lneasured value with up t o 30\' C of the\ndiscrepancy attributable t o the mei?wurement\na\n\nIntroduction\nM s of the interest i n heat pipe startup is\not\nlimited t o the conditions under which a pipe can or\ncannot be started. Nevertheless, when the heat pipe\nis part of a structure designed t o operate a t a high\ntemperature and composed of materials with different\ncoefficients of expansion, it may be necessary t o have\ndetailed information about the performance of the pipe\nduring startup. In the case of a heat-pipe-cooled\nf a s t reactor, where the reactivity is dependent on the\ntemperature of the materials, the performance of the\nheat pipes during startup is especially important.\n\nre Re is the evaporator length, .R is the lingth\nof the hot portion of the condensor, Q is the heat\ninput t o t h e evaporator, and q is the radiation per\nunit b n g t h from the hot zone.\nEnergy balances on the evaporator and condensor\ngive\n\nw\n\nC l e &(T-\n\n:\nQ\n\n-\n\n- we h,,\n\ng ~ l p\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we i s the mass flm.rate of vapor leaving the\nevaporator, hfg the heat of vaporization, and C the\nheat capacity per unit length of the wall, liquid\nand wick. The heat capacity of the vapor is negligible, despite the large heat of vaporization,\nbecause the vapor density i s very small. In addition\nthe heat of fusion is neglected even though t h i s\nproduces a noticeable effect f o r values of T i below\nthe melting point.\nWhen the hot zone f i l l s the. pi*\nEqs. (1)and (2) give\n\nand\n\nk = kc,\n\nThis describes the f i n a l approach t o the steady\nstate.\n\nIn evaluating the flow rate we it is assumed\nthat the vapor velocity becomes sonic a t the end of\nthe hot zone. In the condensing portion of t h e hot\nzone wall f r i c t i o n increases-the Wch number and\ncondensation decreases i t . 3 Hence, the above\nassumption requires t h a t the effects of wall f r i c t i o n\npredominate. This is probable if most of t h e condensation occurs just d a m stream of the sonic point\nwhere the wall i s cold. As T is approximately\nconstant w h i l e the temperature front moves d a m the\npipe, the condensation rate per unit length m is\ngiven by p/hfg. From Eq. (1)with T constant\nThus, the present model imposes\nwe hfg = Q p e e\nthe requirement that QZA \xc2\xb6(&e\nfor ,&<E ;\nt h i s is true when the steady s t a t e temperature is\nwell above the intermediate value of T during the\nmotion of the front.

Under these conditions the stagnation temperature\nTemperature v8 t i m e histories were recorded a t equally\ni s approximately constant.

With t h e quartz tube\nevacuated t o the range of 2 x 10-7 t o r r , the induction\nheater is switched on t o a constant power level\n(e.g. 1 kw).

Since the curves are p a r a l l e l\n.\nt o each other, it can be inferred that the shape o f\nthe front is constant and that a point moving with the\nfront remains a t the same temperature. Hence, a t a\nfixed boint x on the surface of the pipe,\nb T/ 3 t + % 3 T/ 3 x = 0, and the curves of figure 3\ncan be used t o construct the temperature profile of\nthe front.
