Significant performance and efficiency improvements can be obtained through reducing internal flow system leakage, but seal environment requirements continue to become more extreme as the engine thermodynamic cycles advance towards these IHPTET goals. Brush seal technology continues to be pursued by the Air Force to reduce leakage at the required conditions. Likewise, challenges in engine mainshaft air/oil seals are also being addressed. Counter-rotating intershaft applications within the IHPTET initiative involve very high rubbing velocities. This viewgraph presentation briefly describes past and current seal research and development programs and gives a summary of seal applications in demonstrator and developmental engine testing.", "title": "Air Force seal activities", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T22:20:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950007187, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mayhew, Ellen R."}, "organization": {"name": "Wright Lab.", "location": "Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, United States"}}, "id": "6b168f610a4f412a80827cf66992ce5b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950007187, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950007187, "id": "632447f207894433a7b4cb0db1a772d1", "publicationName": "NASA.
