Chapman and C. Stone\nNovember, 1972\n\'Missions to the asteroid belt and to specific asteroids\nwere identified as scientifically important very early in the\nspace program and flyby opportunities to one or more of the\nlarger asteroids have appeared in NASA long range plans for a\nnumber of years. These opportunities have largely been selected\non the basis of launch opportunity and mission energy requirements. More recently it has become apparent through rapid advances in our limited knowledge of the asteroids that the major\nquestions which relate to solar system minor bodies will not be\nsatisfactorily answered, even in the first order, by a mission\nor missions to a single asteroid. Concurrently, advanced propulsion systems are being developed or planned which expand the\nmission possibilities for minor bodies. Solar electric propulsion (SEP) and nuclear electric systems (NEP), when available,\nare capable of performing rendezvous and orbit, multiple asteroid\nflybys, and lander missions.\nThis preliminary study was undertaken to assess the\npresent state of knowledge of asteroids as well as the rate of\nchange of that knowledge to better identify the mission and\ntarget priorities for the advanced planning of asteroidal flights\nin the 1980\'s and beyond. It was apparent at the outset that\nthere was not a unique set of asteroids representing maximum\npriority. Equally important, ground based observations and\nstudies will undoubtedly alter priorities assigned to specific\nasteroids as our knowledge increases. Thus this report presents\na review of current knowledge and derives a categorical set of\npriorities which can be applied to asteroid selection or evaluation by the reader. A preliminary selection has been made\nNT\n\nRESEARCH\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nboth to illustrate the process and to provide the basis for\nearly mission analysis but this selection should not be construed as representing the only choice nor even the "best" one.\nThe report discusses the present state of asteroid knowledge, the scientific goals and priorities attached to asteroid\nexploration, the anticipated advances in knowledge over the\ncurrent decade, asteroid mission consideration and, finally,\nasteroid selection. To summarize, in selecting priority targets\nthe highest .weight should be given to characteristics :of spectral\nreflectivity variations with rotation. High weight should be\ngiven to albedo, especially extreme values. Medium weight should\nbe given to albedo variations with rotation, large light-curve\namplitudes, and, family membership. Low weight should be given\nto extreme (especially rapid) rotations. Little or no weight\nshould be given to other parameters.\nIt is most important to observe the asteroids with these\nimportant compositional characteristics as a function of semimajor axis (highest priority), diameter (high priority), and\nproper e and proper i (especially as related to probably extreme\nvalues of a/in the early solar system, or large distances above\nthe ecliptic). Therefore we want a variety of asteroids which\nspan important ranges of both distance from the sun and diameter\nwhich hopefully also have a variety of implied compositions and\nmany of which have evidence for having exposed their interiors\nas a result of catastrophic collisions. Asteroids should be\nobserved over at least the range of 40 to 350 km diameter.\nIt is important also to span the asteroid belt; the sample should\ninclude an asteroid inside of a = 2.4 and an asteroid with\naphelion distance beyond 3.5 AU.\n\nNT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n4\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nThus, from the point of view of current knowledge about\nthe asteroids, we believe that the major emphasis should be to\nget close to as many asteroids as possible, constrained by two\ncriteria: 1) At least one major asteroid should be visited,\nthe surface characteristics of which suggests possible differentiation; 2) A reasonably wide range of semi-major axes should\nbe explored, particularly including at least one asteroid\n(preferably of bluish color) in an orbit reaching aphelion\nbeyond 3.5 AU. Even these criteria should not be regarded as\nstrict. One would probably not wish to give up the opportunity\nto visit six different asteroids on the same mission if meeting\nthe above criteria reduced the number of targets to only two\nor three.\nTable 1 and Table 2 illustrate the comparative ratings\ndeveloped from this study. The characteristics of asteroids\nwere assigned relative ratings based on the current level of\nknowledge and the known data. The values of individual parameters\nwere then assigned a secondary interest rating. The data for\nthe 118 asteroids were then used together with the rating system\nto classify the asteroids. The groupings of higher interest\nasteroids which results is shown in Table 1. The system was\nused to rate several three asteroid missions as an example.\nThe process is outlined in Table 2.\nA compilation of all reliably known physical data about\nthe asteroids is contained in the appendix (separately bound).\nThere is a data sheet for each of 118 asteroids for which information, in addition to orbital parameters and magnitude,\nis available. Data that is considered unreliable (primarily\nold data such as results of photographic photometery) have been\nomitted. The information is up to date as of June, 1972 and\nincludes the following parameters: the absolute B magnitude;\nB-V and U-B colors observed as a function of phase angle, also\n\nNT\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \' \xe2\x80\xa2 \' \xe2\x80\xa2 \' \' . \'\n\nRESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n5\n\nO\n\nO\n\nCM 00\n\nf-- UN in\n\nCO\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n*\\\n\n\xc2\xabCM\n\nON\n\ni-4\n\nCM\n\nQN\n\n\xc2\xab vo O\n\n<f CM\n\nr-^vr>ooom<fOi\xe2\x80\x94i\nCM\nco co m r-^\n**\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2> vj in\n\n"\n\n*\xc2\xbb CM\n\nSf\nCM\n\nm\n\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2> \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb \xc2\xab f*.,\n\nVj" OO\n\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2> r4 O- S\xc2\xb1 00\nCM <)\xe2\x80\xa2 i-4 1^ CM\n\xe2\x80\xa2>\n\xe2\x80\xa2< vO CO m\nVO r4\n- \xc2\xbb CM O T-l\nOO\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n"\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb\n\nr-<\n\xe2\x80\xa2> r^ 1-4 oo ON\n" \xc2\xab o co oo m r^\n\xe2\x80\xa2> oo oo r-i co -<t vo r~\n1-4 co - i\xe2\x80\x94i \xe2\x80\xa2. .\xe2\x80\xa2* \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb *\\ *\\\nr<\ni\xe2\x80\x94i\n\xc2\xab \xc2\xab \'\xe2\x80\xa2> oo O <!" co\n. \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb. r^. r-~ co vo oo in m\n\nVO\n.\nVO\n\xc2\xab\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb OO\n00 O r4 <f\n\n\xc2\xab CM vo\n\xc2\xabj"\nCO\n"CM\nCM\n^-1\n>>\nCM\n\xc2\xab CM\nr4\n\nco\n\no\n\nm\n\xc2\xabco m\n\n" *\xc2\xa3>\nr4 r-l\n\xe2\x80\xa2>\nin i\xe2\x80\x94l ON r4 CM\n<t r4 VO\n\xc2\xbb\n\xc2\xab oo\nm CM\n\xc2\xab\n"\n<T OO\n\xe2\x80\xa2>\n\nin r-i\n\ntn\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2> O\nCO OO\n4 CM -J- >JD\n\nON\n\nON <t\nO CO\n\ni-l\n\nWO\nCO\n\nO\nUJ\n\nm\no\nz\nO\n{.\n\xc2\xa3\nO\n\n<f\nCM\nVD\n\n\xc2\xab\nCM\n\n"~ co\n\xc2\xab CM m\n\nUJ V)\n\ncc. o\n\n<N\nCO\n\xe2\x80\xa2> CO\nO\n\n" <t\nCO\n\nNt\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 DC.\n\n" vO\n\xc2\xab <t v\xc2\xa3)\n\n\xc2\xab in CM m\nCM\n\n3\nV)\n\n..\xc2\xab o\n\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2>\nVO\n\nCD\n\no:\n\nCO\nV\xc2\xa3>\n\n" CM\n\nr-i\n* CM\nOO CO\nr-l\n\no\no.\n2\no\no\nLJ\nO\n<\nU.\n\nCM\nVO\ni\xe2\x80\x94I\n\nZ\nO\n\nCM\n\nCO\n\nr-T\n\n^K\n> O\n*- <\n\n< o:\n_j <\n\nUJ X\n\na: o\n\nm r\xc2\xbb\nl-l\n\nCO\n\nm\nCO\n\nUJ\n\n_i\nm\n\n1\n\nCO\nCM\nCM\n\n|\n\nr-l\nCM\n\nO\n\n0^\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCO\n\ni\xe2\x80\x941\n*\n\nf^\n\n<f\n\nVO\n\n^\n\nr-l\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCO\n\nco\n\nCO\n%^\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nr-l\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nr-l\n\n1\n\n^O\n\nCO ^O\n1\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCO\n\nvO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 T^\n\noo y\na .\n\nJlj\n\nCM\n\no-\n\n1\nvO\nlO\nr-l\nr-l\n\n1\n1\n\ni\ni\n\nVO\nCM\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nCM\n\nCO\nCM\nCM\n\n1\n1\n\ni\ni\n^^\no\n\nON\n0\n\n1\nvO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2sj"\n\n0\n\n^\nCM\nr-4\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nm\nr^\xc2\xbb\n\'f^\xc2\xbb.\n\nr--\n\nON\n\xe2\x80\xa2\ni\xe2\x80\x94 1\n\n-.\n\nr-l\n\n00 O \'\n\xe2\x80\xa2r-l\nCOJ\n\n<f\n\nvO\n\nrH\n\nCO\n\n00\nCO\nr-4\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nr-4\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCM\n\n.

Sullivan and D. Klopp\nJanuary, 1973\nMissions to asteroids and comets have an important and\nplanned role in the exploration of the solar system. Present\nspacecraft and propulsion systems are adequate for some preliminary missions and the advent of SEP/NEP capabilities will\npermit a variety of minor body flyby and rendezvous missions\nin the 1980\'s. The scientific objectives associated with\nminor body exploration are similar to those for planetary exploration; however, some specific differences in objectives do\nexist. These differences together with the size of these bodies\nand the characteristic miss distances projected have generated\nquestions about the adequacy of scientific instruments for\nthese missions.\nThis study derived measurement specifications for the\nscientific objectives which have been established for flyby\nand rendezvous missions to comets and asteroids. These measurement specifications were then combined with typical spacecraft target separations and target size to estimate instrument requirements such as sensitivity, resolution, response\ntime, spectral range, etc. Table 3 lists the spacecraft/target\nseparations which were used. These were based on ephermeris\nerrors and projected S/C capabilities but were chosen conservatively to place maximum demand upon the scientific instruments. The instrument requirements were then compared with the\n\nNT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nTable 3:\n\nTypical Encounter Speeds and Probable Miss Distances\n\nFlybys;\nAsteroids\n\nComets\n\nRendezvous:\n\nEncounter Speed\n\nProbable Miss Distance\n\n5 - 12 km s-1\n\n~ 100 km\n\n12 km s -1\n\n~ 1000 km\n\nEncounter Speed\n\nProbable Miss Distance\n\nAsteroids\n\n0\n\n10 km\n\nComets\n\n0\n\n10 km\n\nIII RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n10\n\n(orbit?)\n\ncharacteristics of presently available flight rated hardware.\nWhen the requirements for minor body exploration exceeded those\npresently available, expert opinion was obtained on the nature\nof the R & D required. Based on these inputs the instruments\nwere classified in one of three categories:\n1. Adequate flight instruments exist which require\nonly engineering and integration.\n2.\n\nThe basic technology for the instrumentation is\navailable and the normal 3-5 year R & D cycle\nfollowing mission approval should provide flight\nhardware.\n\n3.\n\nThe requirements are sufficiently stringent to\nwarrant R & D expenditures in advance of mission\napproval to ensure the availability of adequate\nflight instrumentation.\n\nThe judgements involved in the classification were,\nof course, subjective and it was occasionally difficult to\nestablish a firm "minimum" capability against which to make\ndecisions. Obviously, increases in sensitivity, resolution,\netc. will yield better data and the scientific community will\nalways desire continued instrument development. However, based\non what we feel are reasonable objectives, the available instruments satisfy most projected needs. Table 4 summarizes\nthe results.

Wells and R. Sullivan\n.January, 1973\n. This report provides a preliminary analysis of the important\naspects of missions orbiting the planet Saturn. Orbital missions\nto the outer planets can be given serious consideration in the\n1980\'s or after fiybys by Pioneer 10/G and Mariner Jupiter-Saturn \'77,\nPrevious studies (by IITRI/Astro Sciences, JPL and NASA/Ames)have\nlooked at Jupiter or biters. This effort, attempts to characterize\nSaturn orbiters in similar detail so that comparisons with Jupiter\nmissions can be made.;\nBroadly speaking, the scientific objectives of Saturn exploration can be grouped under four topics: 1) the atmosphere,\n2) the magnetosphere, 3) the rings and 4) satellites. Like\nJupiter, Saturn has an atmosphere consisting of belts and zones\nwhose global circulation pattern and local features can be studied\nby long term monitoring (imagery) from an orbiting spacecraft.\nThe vertical profiles of temperature, pressure, etc. can be deduced from spectroscopic and occultation measurements. Saturn\'s\nmagnetic field and radiation belts, for which only upper limits\ncan be given, could be very similar to Jupiter\'s and can be investigated using standard fields and particles measurement\ntechniques. The rings are the truly unique feature of the Saturn\nsystem and the primary objective is to describe their photometric\nproperties from which the sizes, shapes and composition of\nparticles can be infered. Saturn has ten satellites including\nTitan, the largest, which has an atmosphere; lapetus, known for\nits large amplitude light curve, and Janus which is so small and\nclose to the rings that it has been seen only four times. Imagery\nis the most useful technique for studying the satellites.\nNT\n\nRESEARCH INSTITUTE\n15\n\nA suggested visual imaging instrument has been designed\naround the standard Mariner vidicon. Two identical 30 cm focal\nlength lenses are used, similar to the arrangement for MVM \'73.\nSaturn fills the field of view at a range of 60 R, a typical\napoapse distance, where the surface resolution is 330 km per line\npair. However, if the spacecraft is spin stabilized, a multidetector spin scan camera should be used. Its resolution at\nthe same distance is 700 km per line pair. The weight of each\ncandidate instrument and an example of a similar one are given\nin Table 5.\nFor accurate photometric measurements a separate photopolarimeter with five or more spectral bands is needed. It and\nthe selected infrared ;(IR) radiometer have a 0.5\xc2\xb0 field of view\nor a resolution of 3000 km at 6 R0. The radiometer has a signal\ns\nto noise ratio of at least 100 in two bands, 20-35|am and 60-100|am,\nRadio occultation and radio tracking data are derived from an\nanalysis of the dual frequency radio signal received at the earth.\nA microwave radiometer channel at 13 cm can and should be added\nto the spacecraft command receiver.\nAn ultraviolet (UV) spectrometer, which has fixed detectors\nfor measureing specific emission and absorption lines of H, Ho,\nHe and other less abundant species, is easily constructed with\n20 A spectral resolution, A 1/3 x 3\xc2\xb0 field of view is appropriate even though an atmospheric scale height is not resolved\nduring airglow measurements of Saturn\'s limb. It is very difficult to get both good spectral and spatial resolution in the IR,\neven with an interferometer. The best option is to measure ab=\nsorbed solar radiation between about 1 and 5nm. The magnetosphere, its ^interaction with the solar wind and its trapped\nparticles are measured with a complementary set of instruments\nincluding a magnetometer, charged particle detectors and radio\nreceivers to record plasma waves and planetary emissions.\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n16\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nTable\n\n5\n\nINSTRUMENTS FOR SATURN ORBITERS\n\nf\n\ni\n\n.\'\n\n.-.\n\n- \'\n\n-\n\nWeight Payload Similar Instruments\n#1 #2\nX\nMariner 9\n30\n-\n\nInstrument\n\n;\xe2\x80\xa2 . ; \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\'.\' .\xe2\x80\xa2 - . \'\' \'.\xe2\x80\xa2 . - \' \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 . \xe2\x80\xa2;\n|\n\nTV System\n\n\'.\n\n12\n\n-\n\nX\n\nATS\n\nPhotopolarimeter\n\n4\n\nx\n\nX\n\nPioneer 10\n\nIR Radiometer\n\n4\n\nX\n\nX\n\nPioneer 10\n\nRadio Science\n\n; - \'.\n\nX\n\nx\n\nViking\n\nX\n\na\n\nMariner \'73\nMariner 9\n\nSpin Scan\n\nUV Spectrometer\n\n4\n\nIR Spectrometer\n\n15\n\nX\n\n-\n\n3\n\nX\n\nX\n\nPioneer 10\n\na\n\n\'\nX\n\nPioneer 10\n\nMagnetometer\n\n;\n\n;. \'5.;\n\nCharged Particles\nPlasma Wave\n\n4\n\na\n\nX\n\nOGO\n\nRadio Astronomy\n\n3\n\na\n\nX\n\nRAE\n\n5\n\na\n\nX\n\nHelios\n\nMicrometebroid Detector\n\n:\n\nTotal Pay load #1\n\n60\n\nPay load #2\n\n36\n\nx = -selected\na = alternate\n\nNT\n\nRESEARCH\n17\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nFinally, there is a micrometeroid composition detector which\ndetermines the mass of ions formed by hypervelocity impacts.\nTwo payloads have been selected from these candidate instruments. The first emphasizes atmospheric measurements and is\nintended for a Mariner spacecraft which has inertial stabilization and a science payload capacity of 60 kg. The fields and\nparticles instruments are well represented in the second payload\nwhich is made up of experiments which can work well on the spin\nstabilized Pioneer spacecraft. The pointing requirements of the\nTV system and IR spectrometer prevent them from being alternate\ninstruments for the Pioneer payload. Their weight is also a\nproblem.\nThe rings of Saturn are a hazard to an orbiting spacecraft\nwhich crosses the equatorial plane at a radius of less than 2.3 Re\nBecause of uncertainties about the full spatial extent of the\nrings a nodal radius of 3.0 R s was selected for nominal missions\nand 4.0 R S for a worst case analysis. Microwave observations of\nSaturn have not established the presence of radiation belts, but\nthe upper limits are consistent with the nominal model for\nJupiter\'s trapped particles. A spacecraft with a periapse of\n3.0 R_ or more can survive for at least ten orbits in the nominal\n.S\n\nenvironment. Because the rings cut off the belts at 2.3 R0, a\nS\nperiapse of 1.6 R S can also be used. For a worst case analysis\na periapse of four Saturn radii is appropriate.\nThere are three types of orbits that are useful for Saturn\norbiter missions. The first maximizes the phase angle coverage\nfor atmospheric and ring system measurements by using an orbit\nplane that passes very near the subsolar point. Figure la shows\nthat the spacecraft\'s motion, as typically seen from the sun,\npasses in front of the rings and Saturn\'s disc so that 0\xc2\xb0 phase\nangle data is obtained over the full radial extent of the rings.\n\nI/T\n\nRESEARCH\n\n18\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nUJ\n\nto\n\nUJ\nV)\n0.\n\nQ.\n\n<\no\n\n8\n\no.\n\nQ.\n\n.2\nO\n\no\n\nz.\ncc.\n\noc\nu.\nz\na:\n\nCO\n\nU.\n\nU.\n\nUJ\n\nUJ\n\nUJ\n\n<r\nu.\n\nor\no\n\n_i\no\n\no\n\no\n>\n\nO\nQ\nZ\n\n<\no\nUJ\n\na:\no\nu.\n\nI\n\nQ.\n\nto\n\nz\no\n\no\nu\n\nUJ\n\n>\nUJ\n\na:\no\no\n\n5\n\nO\no:\n\nO\n\noc\n\nCO\nDC\nO\n\nm\na:\no\nu.\no\n\nU.\nO\n\xc2\xa3\nUJ\n\nUJ\n\n19\n\nThen the spacecraft passes behind the rings and both solar extinction and radio occultation measurements can be made. Such\nan orbit should have a periapse radius of 3.0 R s and a period of\n15 to 30 days. During the long periods of time near apoapse the\nspacecraft is well positioned to observe the global atmospheric\ncirculation pattern (see Figure lb). Close passes of Titan, the\nlargest satellite, can often be arranged in conjunction with\nthis orbit.\nTaking the periapse as 1.6 R0 minimizes the energy reS\nquirement for orbit capture. But the orbit plane is then restricted so that the node is at 3.0 R_.. Typically this type of\nS\n. .\norbit does not have complete phase angle coverage. The view\nfrom the sun in Figure lc shows that no 0\xc2\xb0 coverage is acquired.\nFrom apoapse the view is about the same as the previous case.\nA particular advantage of this orbit is the fact that it penetrates the magnetic field to the 2.15 R S shell and can observe\nthe effects of the rings on the trapped particles. Close encounters with the larger satellites are not possible.\nFinally for maximizing the number of close encounters\nwith satellites, an elliptical orbit is essential. This requires two additional impulses to first change the plane and\nthen reduce the orbit period to about 16 days which is an integer\nmultiple of the period of five satellites. The equatorial orbit\nalso has a view of the atmosphere unobstructed by the rings but\nwith the polar regions always forshortened.\nThe first payload option could be used on each of the\nthree candidate orbits although it might be profitable to include\nthe fields and particles instruments on the minimum periapse\nradius orbit.

The larger propulsion system\nwould require structural changes.similar to the difference between 1969 Mars flyby and the 1971 orbiter. A proposed MJS \'77\nrevision of the radio system was assumed which would improve its\nscientific capabilities and decrease its weight.\nThe second payload option belongs on a Pioneer spacecraft\nin the minimum periapse or maximum phase angle coverage orbit.\nSignificant changes to the current Pioneer 10/G spacecraft are\nrequired to convert it to a Saturn orbiter. A maximum data rate\nof 12 Kbps is provided by a new 10 w X-band transmitter and\nstorage .is increased to 3 x 10 bits. Two MHW RTG\'s are employed\nto achieve 230 w of spacecraft power at end of mission. Structural changes caused by the larger power source and orbit capture\npropulsion system bring the net mass in orbit to an estimated\n312 kg (excluding propulsion).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 .\n. \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 .\n\\\n.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\nThe optimum year for direct ballistic trajectories to\nSaturn is 1985. Launch vehicle performance for this opportunity\nand the spacecraft requirement are both plotted in Figure 2 as\napproach mass versus approach speed.

Spadoni\nJuly,;1972\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2 ^\nCurrent analysis of advanced unmanned planetary missions\nin the 1980\'s and beyond indicate the need for propulsion systems\nwith performance capabilities beyond those of current and near\nstate-of-art. One propulsion system concept being considered\nto fill this need is nuclear electric low thrust propulsion (NEP).\nThe only on-going NEP development program is the internally-fueled\nthermionic reactor. The major development effort is concentrated\non design proof and testing of the thermionic fuel element and\noverall reactor design. Technology forecasts indicate that an\ninternally-fueled thermionic NEP system capable of 20,000 hour\noperating thrust time could be available for mission application\nby late 1983.\nTwo different NEP system power levels are considered for\nperformance analysis: 100 kw and 250 kw. The 100 kw NEP system\nUses a Centaur (D\xc2\xb0IT) chemical stage for injection to an interplanetary transfer and the 250 kw system uses a spiral escape\nmaneuver. Advanced chemical systems used for ballistic performance comparison are the Centaur (GT)/Kick, Centaur (GT)/VUS\nand Centaur (GT)/Centaur (GT)/VUS. All systems are launched to\na 270 n.mi. parking orbit via the space shuttle with a payload\ncapability of 50000 Ibs.\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH INSTITUTE\n25\n\nThe set pf missions selected for performance analysis\nrfincludes loose elliptical orbiters and close circular orbiters\nof the outer planets, satellite orbiter/landers, a Saturn-UranusNeptune flyby, Halley rendezvous, and Ceres sample return.\nPerformance comparison is in general made on the basis of net\npayload at the target as a function of flight time. NEP performance is shown for unconstrained and constrained (20,000 hours)\nthrusting time. Specific impulse is optimized and ranges from\n4000 sec to 7000 sec.\nIn general, results show that both NEP systems are\ncapable of performing all the missions considered but that the\nballistic systems could perform only those missions requiring\na moderate expenditure of energy at the target (loose elliptical\norbiters, satellite orbiter/landers, and multi-planet flyby).\nFor these missions, the NEP systems are found to yield as high\nas:30% (100 kw) to 50% (250 kw) reduction in flight time for a\ngiven payload over the chemical ballistic systems.

The NEP data are for systems constrained to a maximum operating thrust time of 20000 hours.\nFor the payload levels indicated, the 250 kw system out-performs\nthe 100 kw system only in those missions requiring relatively\nhigh energy expenditure. For moderate energy levels, the two\nsystems are comparable.\nA detailed analysis of the Ceres sample return mission\nshowed that the 100 kw NEP system has the capability to return\nas much as 120 kgs of surface sample plus a photographic coverage\nat 1 meter resolution of 100% of the asteroids\' surface.\n\nIll\n\nRESEARCH\n\n26\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nON\nrH\n\ncj\nis\n\nw\n52\n\nin\nm\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\no\n\nO\n\no\no\nrH\n\ni\n\nO\nCO\n\nI-l\n\n|\n^D\n\no\n\nO\n\nvO\n\n^ *\nJ\n\nr-l\n\n\'T\n^\nCM\n\nr-l\n\n1\n\nm\ni***.\n\no\n\nO\n|\n\nVO\nCM\n\ni\n\ni\n\n>\n^\n\n-d-\n\nI\nCO\n\nCM\n\nW\nO\n\nCO\n\n\xc2\xa7\nCO\nCO\n\nH\nOS\n\n< co\n\nP ^\n\nPH\n\n^o\n\nin\n\nPQ\n\nW CM\n\nH\n\nH PL,\n\nO o\nO m\nin CO\n\nO\n\n"">\n\nO 0\n\nCO\n\nr-l\nt-H\n\nON\n\nrH\n\nO\nCJ\n\no\n\nm i~\xc2\xbb\nin\nr-4\n\n0\nO\n*H^\n\nr-l\n\no\n\nCM\n\nin\nr^*\n\nvO\n\nrH\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2f\n^\n\nCM\n\n0\nCO\n1\nvO\nCM\n\n^J\n\n0\nm \xe2\x80\xa2^3\nON\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2I;\n\nPQ S\nc*J S\nO O\n\nO O\nin CM\nm\n\nO\nr-l\n\nON\n\nrH\n\n\xe2\x80\xa23\n\n>\xe2\x80\xa2\nCO\n\nO\nvO\n\xc2\xbbjr-l\n\nO O\nON vO\n\nO\nvO\n\nr-t\n\nr-l\n\no\n\nO\n\nm O\n\n00 vO\nrH CM\n\n0 O\n\nm sjI-l\n\n00\nCM\n\nxf\n\nO\nO\n\n\xc2\xbb^JCM\n\nO\nm\nON\n\nO\n\nm\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nrH\n\nf-J CO\n\n|\n\nQ\n\nPH\n\no/\'-x\npj <5 1^\n\nEH fd\nM PH\n\nCM\n\nV\n\nH\nCO\n\nCM\n\nO\n\no\n0\n\nCO\n\no\no\n\nS CO\nO CO\n\nCO\n\nPH\n\nP\nPd\nO\nO\n\nrH\n\n\xc2\xa7\nPH\n\nO\n\nr-t PH\n2 ^\n\no O\n0 0\no rH\no\nrH\n\n,_! r-l\nO O\n^\nj\n^\n^\nr-l\n\nCO\n00\n\nI-l\n\nr-l\n\nO 0 0\nO O\n0 0 CO\nr-l\n\nrH\n\nr-l\n\n0O\no O\no O\nrH\n\nrH\n\no o o\no o o\no rH rH\no o\nrH\n\nO\n0\nO\n\n<J\n\nJ3\n\nrH\n\nO\nrJ\n^\n\nH\nD\n2\n\nH EH\nCO CO\n\nII\ns:\nQ\n\nS\n\n\xc2\xb0H\nW\n\n3a\nPH\nPH\n\nH\nCO\n\nH\nO\n\ng\n\np5 W\ns\n\nH\n\nPQ\ng\n\no\nr-l\nCO\nCO\n\nO\n\nP\nI g.\n\xc2\xa3>H\n\nO\nCO\n\nCO\n\nM\n\nOS\n\nOS\n\nw w\n\ns\n\n55\nH\nPQ\nOS\n\n0\n\nw\nH\n\na\nO5\n\no\n\nOS\n[]\nV\nEH OS\nH\nPQ\n\nH\n\nOS\n\nOS OS\n\nQ\n\nEH\nH\n\n& \xc2\xa7\nW O\nH\n\nS\n\nPQ\n\nI\nI-l\n\no\n\n1 s\n\xc2\xa7\no\n\n\xc2\xa7\nH\n\nS\n\n.P\nP\n1 g.

The payload data for both flybys and orbiters is presented graphically as a function of flight time for various\nlaunch years, launch vehicles, and orbit sizes. All the relevant parameters have been combined to produce useful data on\na single graph to make advanced planning much easier.\nTable 7 presents the mission mode/flight mode combinations\nused in the first edition of the Handbook. The three target\nplanets are Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, with launch opportunities\nranging from 1974 to 1986. Table 8 shows the various fixed\nparameters assumed in generating the payload curves. Three\ntechnology advancements are assumed available in 1980: 20 kw\nsolar electric propulsion, shuttle-based launch systems9 and\nspace-stbrable retro propulsion for orbiter missions.\nFigure 3 presents a typical set of payload curves for\nflyby-type missions: Jupiter flyby in 1977\xe2\x80\x9e The kink in the\ncurves is due to the constraint in launch declination.\nFigure 4 presents a set of payload curves typical of orbiter\nmissions: a 30 orbiter mission to Jupiter in 1983.\nIn all, the Handbook contains 80 graphs with almost\n400 performance curves.

Niehoff and A. Friedlander\nOctober, 1972\nBasic performance trade-offs between mission flight time\nand net useful payload are analyzed for advanced propulsion\nsystems applied to unmanned planetary missions. The results\nare part of the much larger Advanced Propulsion Comparisons\n(APC) study undertaken by NASA and the AEG during 1972 and 1973.\nA total of 26 different propulsion options encompassing chemical\nrocket propulsion (CRP), nuclear rocket propulsion (NRP), solar\nelectric propulsion (SEP), and nuclear electric propulsion (NEP)\nare analyzed. These options are applied to the APC Planetary\nMission Model, consisting of 21 missions launched in the period\n1981-1994 (Table 9).\xe2\x80\xa2 A total of almost 300 propulsion/mission\ncombinations are analyzed. Payload versus time trade-offs are\npresented for each combination in tabular and graphical form.\nIn addition, basic assumptions, stage performance graphs, and\ntabular trajectory data are included in the report. The results\nare summarized using propulsion-ready scenarios to illustrate\nperformance conclusions. It is shown that all of the competing\nadvanced propulsion systems, almost irregardless of technology\nbase restrictions, provide about the same performance improvement\ncompared to that available with only Shuttle-based Centaur and\nTug stages. This conclusion applies to mission payloads increased up to 50% of baseline weights developed by JPL. It\nappears, based on this conclusion, that selection of advanced\npropulsion systems should emphasize cost and development factors,\nas well as geocentric mission applications perhaps, rather than\nbasic planetary performance capability. These, and other considerations including an economics analysis, are the subject of\nthe final report of the APC Committee.\n\nNT\n\nRESEARCH\n35\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nTABLE 9\nAPC PLANETARY MISSION MODEL\n\nNO.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n. 6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n\nLAUNCH\nYEAR\n\nMISSION\nEncke Slow Flybya\n\n1979\n1981/82\n1983\n\nEncke Rendezvous\nVenus Radar Mapper\n\n1984\n1984\n1984-85\n1985\n1985\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1989\n1989\n1990\n1990\n1990\n\nMars Semi -Autonomous Rover\nMercury Orbiter\nSaturn Orbiter (W/Probe)\nVesta Rendezvous\nHalley Flyby\n\nJupiter Orbiter\nU/N Swingby (W/U-Probe)\n\nUranus Orbiter (W/Probe)\nVenus Large Lander\nNeptune Orbiter (W/Probe)\nJ/P Swingby\nGanymede Or biter /Lander\n\nMars Surface Sample Return\nHalley Rendezvous\nS/U/N Swingby (S/U-Probe)\n\n0.1 AU Solar Probe\nSaturn Ring Probe\nCeres Sample Return\nDeimos Recon/Phobos Sample Return\n\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1988\n1993\n1994\n\nTARGET ORBIT SIZE\n\nV\n\nV\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1.08\n1.08\n1.44\n1.41\n3.00\n\n4.00\n1.20\n1.08\n\n1.20\n\n1,04\n1.30\n_\n1.20\n\n1.10\n\n-\n\nor\n\n3.25\n1.08\n10.63\n1.41\n58.65\n\n45.14\n=\n36.61\n1.08\n41.80\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n1.04\n1.30\n\n=\n2.30\n1.10\n\na.

Dunkin, P. Pekar, D. Spadoni and C. Stone\nJanuary, 1973\n.\nA basic model is presented for estimating the cost of unmanned lunar and planetary programs. The level of input parameters\nrequired by the model and its accuracy in predicting cost are\nconsistent with pre-Phase A type mission analysis.\nCost data was collected and analyzed for eight lunar and\nplanetary programs; Total cost was separated into the following\ncomponents: labor, overhead, materials, and technical support.\nThis study determined, with surprising consistency, that direct\nlabor cost of unmanned lunar and planetary programs comprises\n30 percent of the total program cost.\nTwelve program categories were defined for modeling: six\nspacecraft subsystem categories (science, structure, propulsion,\nelectrical power, communications, and guidance and control);\nand six support function categories (assembly and integration,\ntest and quality assurance, launch and flight operations, ground\nequipment, systems analysis and engineering, and program management) . An analysis, by category, showed that on a percentage\nbasis, direct labor cost and direct labor manhours compare on a\none-to-one ratio. Therefore, direct labor hours is used as the\nparameter for predicting cost. This has the advantage of\neliminating the effect of inflation on the analysis.\nFigure 5\nis a flow diagram of the use of the cost model\nin forecasting. The boxes in the upper left involve the mission\ndependent information. Scaling laws, physical and mathematical\nrelationships, and synthesis guidelines, provide the basic\nestimate of manhours. The remainder of the model deals with\nconverting the basic cost element, direct labor hours, into cost.\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH \' INSTITUTE\n\n37\n\nU\n\nt<\n5\n\nLJ\n\ni\no\n\n\xc2\xa7\nO\no\n\n38\n\nThis requires two additional steps. First, the average pay scale\n($/hr) must be determined for the period of the program. If desired, the selected pay scale could include inflation between\nthe time of the estimate and program execution. The final step\ninvolves converting direct labor cost into total program cost.\nTotal program cost can be determined by dividing direct labor\ncost by its fraction of total cost. The relationship used\nthroughput this study is:\nTotal Program Dollars -Direct Labor Hours x Average Hourly Rate\n\n:\n\n;\n\nv.;:-;:;V/;:;:\'- .;\xe2\x80\xa2; v \xe2\x80\xa2\':\xe2\x80\xa2-\'.\'\'.\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\'\xe2\x80\xa2 \'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2: .\'\xe2\x80\xa2-\xe2\x80\xa2\'\xe2\x80\xa2.\'. /; \' . \'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 .3\n\nTab/le io presents cost estimates and errors for the programs used in developing the cost model. The Surveyor program\ndid hot follow clearly established trends of the other seven\nprograms, and was subsequently not used in the development of\nthe model. As an example, the model was used to predict the\ncost of the Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 program. The model predicted a program cost of $120 Million, which is approximately\n20 percent higher than current estimates.\nRecommendations for further effort include: update the\ncurrent data base by obtaining the latest Mariner 1971, Viking\nOrbiter and Viking Lander cost data; expand the data base by\nobtaining cost data for such programs as Mariner Venus 1967,\nMariner Venus/Mercury 1973, and interplanetary and cis-lunar\nPioneer and Explorer programs; and develop cost models for\nplanetary atmospheric entry probes.\n\nNT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n39\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nJ-l\no\n\nw\n\nCO\n\nCM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.o\n\nCM\n\nI\n\nCO\n\n-3-\n\nCO\n\nCM\n\nCO\n\nr^\n\n<f\n\nr^\n\nt-<\n\nI\n\n:\n\nCM\n\ni-l\n\n1\n\nCM\n\nCM\n\nr-l\n\nO\n\nCM\nCM\n\n1\n\no\no\nvo\n\n1\n\nr-l\n\ns.\n\no\nn\n^\nw\n4-1\nO\n\nQ)\nI)\n\n0 4->0\n\xe2\x80\xa2H to O\nT3 O O\n\no*^\n\nvO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ^\xc2\xbbo \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCM\n\n00\n\nCM\n\n00\n\nlO\n\nUrH\n\n</>\n\nCM\nvo\n\no\no\n\no\nm\n\nr-l\n\n<1)\n\n}-l\n\nCM\n\nr^"^\n\n00\n\n\'\n\n00\n\nr-t\n\n<f\n\nCM\n\nON\n\nO\n\nr-l\n\no^\n\n**^\n\n\'\n\nr\xe2\x80\xa2 m\n\xe2\x80\xa2 r\xc2\xbb- . \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xabtf\n\nCM\n\no^\n\nco\n\noo\n\no\nON\nON\n\noo\noo\n\n<f\nvo\n\nVO\n\nCM\n\nrH\n\nr-t\n\nO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2I-I\n\n4->\n\n<u\n\nI\n^1\nCL>\n\n4J\nCO\nO\n\nOJ 4J O\n\nS\n\nCO O\n00\n\n<\n\n-co-\n\n<f\no\n\nCM\nr^\nm\n. \xe2\x80\xa2 st\n\nO\nCM\nCM\n\nvo\nO\nCM\n\ni-J\n\nO\n\nt-\xc2\xbb\n00\nr>.\n\noo\nin\n\nf-4\n\no\ni^\n\n<f\nCM\n\n<f\noo\n\nCM\n\nOO\nCO\noo\n\nCO\n\nT-l\n\n00\nCM\n<j-\n\nON\n^\nCM\n\nm\n<f\nco\n\nm\n\nON\nr-l\nCO\nCM\n\n<U\n\n0)\n\n\'a\no\n\ne\n\n0)\nCO\n\nr-<\nJQ\n\nE\n\n03\n\nM\nO\n\n<f\n\nvo\n^s\n\nON\n\nvo\n\\*~t\n\n40\n\ni-l\n\nr>^\n\n\\J_^1\n\no\n\nM\n\no\n\n^^\n\niJ\n\nt^\n\no\n\n^^\n\nj^\n\'*\n|\xe2\x80\x94 >\n\n4J\nO\n\nc\n\n3.\n\nSPECIAL STUDIES AND ACTIVITIES\n\nNT\n\nRESEARCH\n\nINSTITUTE\n\n3.1 ADVANCED PLANNING ACTIVITIES\n\nWithin the Long-Range Planning Contract approximately\none man year of effort is set aside for fast-response technical\nsupport to the Planetary Programs Office.
