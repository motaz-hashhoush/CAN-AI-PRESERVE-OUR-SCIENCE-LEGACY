Brajnikoff and Arthur W. Rogers\nSUMMARY\nThe pressure recovery, mass flOW, and axial force of four bodies\nwith nose inlets were measured at Mach numbers between 1.4 and 2.0 and\nangles of attack of 0 0 , 30 , 60 , and 90 . The Reynolds number based on\nthe model inlet diameters varied between 0.4 and 0.8 million. Schlieren\nphotographs of models at 0 0 angle of attack were used for calculation of\nthe external wave drag resulting from the bow shock waves.\nThe drag coefficients of axially symmetric diffusers operating at\nthe maximum mass-flow rates were calculated from schlieren photographs\nof the head shock waves and frictional drag considerations. The calculations showed good agreement with the measured values. At reduced massflow ratios the agreement was only fair. The results also show that the\nexternal drag of axially symmetric ducted bodies at 0 0 angle of attack\ncan be predicted to a good degree of accuracy from theoretical considerations alone, if the entrance flow is supersonic and the point of transitio~ of the boundary layer is known.\nIn general, it was found that the minimum axial-force coefficient\noccurred with maximum mass flow through the diffuser, and a small\nreduction in the mass flow resulted in a large increase in the axialforce coefficient. At reduced mass flows the effect of mass flow on the\ntotal-pressure recovery of a diffuser with a subsonic or a supersonic\n0\nentrance was small. Changes in the a Il\xe2\x82\xac"\n~f attack from 0 0 to 9 generally caused small decreases in the total-pressure recovery. In all\ncases when the maximum mass-flow decreased with increasing angle of\nattack the minimum axial-force coeffic; ~t increased by a considerable\namount.\n\n... \xc2\xb7m\n\nI\n\nI\nNACA RM A51C12\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe total drag of a s upersonic aircraft propelled by a turbojet or\na ramjet engine may be increased appreciably by an improperly designed\ninduction system, part icularly in view of the large size of the r equired\nair inlet in relation to the fuselage. Simultaneously, a low eff i ciency of the sys tem in recovering the ram pressure reduces the thrust\navailable from the engine. To avoid such consequences , a de signer must\nbe able to estimate the charac teri sti cs of inlet configurations likely\nto satisfy his design requirements.\nFor the cas es of entirely supersonic flow around axially symmetric\ncowlings the external pressure or wave drag due to inlets can be determined theoretically (references 1 and 2). When such inlets operate at a\nreduced mass flow, a transonic flow region exists around the lip of the\ninle~ and an entirely theoretical solution becomes extremely difficult .\nIn such cases it is most practical to resort to experimental measurements of the drag for ce or to shadowgraph or s chlieren pictures . Once\nthe shape and location of the bow wave are known, it is possible to\ndetermine the pressure drag by the methods of references 3 and 4. A\nfair estimate of the fri ctional drag of a cowling at supersonic Mach\nnumbers may be obtained through application of the present theories for\nvarious types of boundary layers (references 5 to 8), provided that the\nlocation of the transition r egion is known and there are no strong\nadverse pressure fields a cting on the boundary layer . The pressure\nrecovery at super sonic speeds can be estimated in cases of twodimensional or axially symmetri c inlets receiving little or no boundary\nlayer by the methods of reference 9.\nFour axially symmetric nose inlets have been tested in the Ames Sby S-inch supersonic wind tunnel in order to provide a basis for comparison with scoop inlets. It is the purpose of this report to present the\ncharac~eristics of these nose inlets as determined by force and pressure\nmeasurements and to compare them with values calculated by various\nmethods . Since forces were measured in the direction of the model axis\nonly, the axial- force coefficients are presented instead of drag coef ficients . Although axial and drag coefficients are synonymous only at\nzero angle of attack, drag symbols were used for axial forces for the\nsake of simplicity .\nSYMBOLS\nA\n\narea, square feet\n\na\n\nspeed of sound, feet per second\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\n3\n\nadditive drag coefficient (due to diffusion ahead of entrance),\ndimensionless\nfore-drag coefficient (\n\n~\n\n) , dimensionless\n\'lo ef\nexternal axial-force coefficient measured along model axis\n\nL\n\nC\n\nDw\n\nDe _\'\\, dimensionless\n\\\'laAref)\nwave-drag coefficient (De-Dr ) , dimensionless\n\n\\~aAref\n\nexternal force acting along model axis (does not include internal\nflow drag or base drag), pounds\nforce acting along model axis (does not include base drag),\npounds\nDf\n\nforce acting along model axis due to friction on external model\nsurface, pounds\n\nd\n\ninlet diameter of cowling, feet\n\nH\n\ntotal pressure) pounds per square foot\n\nHS\n\naverage total pressure at survey station weighted on area basis)\npounds per square foot\n\n2\n\nlength of subsonic diffuser) feet\n\nM\n\nMach number\n\nm\n\nmass-flow rate\n\np\n\nmass-flow ratio (ratio of mass flowing through the diffuser\nto that flowing in the free stream through an area e~ual\nto that of the flow area at the inlet station,\np l VlAl) dimensionless\nPoVaAl \'\nstatic-pressure coefficient (~:o), dimensionless\n\np\n\nstatic pressure, pounds per square foot\n\nq\n\ndynamic pressure\n\nR\n\nbody ordinate, inches\n\n(~))\n\ndimensionless\n\n(pVA)) slugs per second\n\n(~pV2),\n\npounds per square foot\n\n4\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\n(v:) ~\n\nRe\n\nReynolds nUDlber\n\nV\n\nvelocity, feet per se cond\n\nx\n\ndistance from inlet station along model axis, feet\n\n~\n\nangle of attack, degrees\n\nr\n\nratio of specific heats for air\n\nV\n\n\' -;\n\np\n\ndimensionless\n\n= 1.40, dimensionless\n\nnematic viscosity, feet squared per second\n\nmas s density, slugs per cubic f oot\nSubscripts\n\no\n\nfree stream\n\n1\n\ninlet station\n\n2\n\ndiffuser exit\n\n3\n\nsettling chamber (rake station)\n\n4\n\noutlet station (choked flow)\n\nbase\n\nplane surface normal to model axis and constituting the rear\nboundary of the model\n\nref\n\nreference area (frontal area of body exposed to stream), square\nfeet\n\nAPPARATUS\n\nWind-Tunnel and Drag Balance\nThe tes ts of t hi s invest igation were performed in the Ames 8- by\n8-in ch supers onic wi nd tunnel in the range of Mach numbers be t ween 1.40\nand 2 .01.

As shown, a mOQel is mounteQ on a steel shell that\nfloats on three rows of bearing balls insiQe a stationary shell supported by two struts. The fore and aft motion of the inner shell is\nrestricteQ onlY by the strain gage used for measuring axial forces.\nShrouQs having somewhat smaller forward diameters than the bases of\nmodels provide fairing between the bases of the models and the outer\nshell. The shrouds and the stationary shell have orifices for measuring\nstatic pressures acting on the base of the moQel and the ends of the\nfloating shell so that corrections for these pressures being other than\nthe free-stream static pressure can be maQe \xe2\x80\xa2 . InsiQe the inner shell,\nwhich serves as a settling chamber, is a survey rake consisting of four\ntotal and three static pressure tubes; this rake can be rotated from\noutsiQe the winQ tunnel through 360 0 by means of a Bear Qrive. The mass\nflow through the mOQel is controlleQ by a variable area outlet consisting of a stationary ring and an adjustable plug operated by a wedgedrive system. The ring is mounted rigiQly on the survey-rake shaft so\nthat there is a clearance of 0.005 inch between its outer periphery and\nthe inner shell. Though such an arrangement does not allow reduction of\nmass flow to zero, it provides a means for varying the flow rate without\nexerting additional pressure forces on the inner shell. Measurements\nwith a mOQel at angles to the stream Qirection can be made at angles of\n30 , 60 , anQ 90 by attaching the balance at the proper angle in relation\nto the horizontal strut as shown in figure 1.\nj\n\nMODEL DESCRIPl\'ION\n\nFigure 2 shows the models tested and gives their pertinent dimensions. The first model, which was used to determine the accuracy of\nforce measurement, was a cone of 20 0 incluQeQ angle; it haQ eight orifices which were useQ to obtain the pressures acting on the surface of\nthe cone at the time of the drag-force measurement at 0 0 angle of attack.\nThe two open-nose inlet modelS, Qesignated A anQ B, haQ the same external\nshape. The entrance section of mOQel A was cylinQrical for a length of\n1.5 diameters and was followeQ by a diffuser of constant divergence\nangle. Model B had a contracting entrance Qesigned so that supersonic\nflow through the inlet coulQ be established at Mo=l.60, according to the\nrelations for an invisciQ, one-Qimensional flow. The contraction was\nfolloweQ by a short constant-area section, the purpose of which was to\nstabilize a swallowed normal shock wave. This section was located so\nthat at a free stream Mach number of 1.70 the obli~ue conical-ehock wave\nfrom the cowling lip woulQ be neutralized, if the flow were twodimenSional, by the expansion wave originating at the forward end of the\nstraight section. Subsonic Qiffusion was accomplisheQ by a passage of\nconstant Qivergence angle.\n\n6\n\nNACA EM A51C12\n\nModel C was a conical-ehock diffuser designed to handle approximately the same mass of air per second at a Mach number of 2.01 as the\nopen-nose diffuser A at its maximum flow-rate condition. Model C had a\n25\xc2\xb0-semiangle cone and a cowling with a rounded lip located so that a\nline joining the apex of the cone and the leading edge of the cowl made\na 45 0 angle with the model axis. The variation of the diffuser-area\nratio normal to the mean-flow direction is shown in figure 3. At the\ndesign Mach number of 1.8 the diffuser was to operate with an external\nnormal shock wave. This model was about one-eighth the size of and\ns imilar to a conical-ehock diffuser tested at the NACA Lewis Laboratory\nin the 8- by 6-foot supersonic wind tunnel.\nModel D had a 30\xc2\xb0-eemiangle cone and a cowling with a sharp lip\nlocated on a line originating at the apex of the cone and making a 46 0\nangle with the model axis. The maximum frontal areas of modelS C and D\nwere the same, but model D was designed to handle approximately 0.7 of\nthe mass flow of model C in the test range of Mach numbers. The external\nsurface area and length of cowling D were 55 and 62.6 percent of those\nof model C, respectively, ~nd model D had steeper angles between the\nexternal surface and the model axis. The 20 0 cone, the central bodies\n(inlet cones), and the cowlings were highly polished to ensure the longest run of laminar boundary layer possible under the existing test\nconditions.\nTEST MEI\'HODS\n\nInstrumentation\nThe tunnel total pressure, the survey-rake pressures, and the base\npressures were measured on a multiple-tube mercury manometer. Dibutyl\nphthalate was used to measure the differences between total and static\npressures registered by the survey rake at low-mass flow rates. The\ntotal temperature of the flow and the temperature of the strain gage\n(used for correcting the gage readings for thermal shift) were measured\nby thermo couples registering the temperature on an indicating potentio~\neter. Measurements of the axial force acting on the strain gage were\nobtained in terms of deflection of a dynamically balanced galvanometer\ncalibrated for the gage in use. The flow about the model was observed\nand photographed through a schlieren apparatus having a knife edge parallel to the direction of the free stream.\nProcedure\nThe wind tunnel was calibrated with the aid of a rake of five\nstatic-pressure probes to determine the static-pressure gradients\n\n7\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\nexisting in the test se ction at the nominal Mach number settings of\n1.40) 1 . 50 ) 1.70) 1.90) and 2.01. During the calibration and the subsequent tes ts) the tunnel total pressure was maintained by manual contrel, within \xc2\xb1O.l inch of mercury of the preassigned value. In general )\nthe test procedure was simi lar to that of reference 10.\nThe numb er of pressure and force readings at a fixed mass-flow rate\nand different angular positions of the survey rake varied from 5 to 10)\ndepending on the uniformity of the total-pressure distribution in the\ndiffuser . The pressure recovery and the axial force were measured for\nsix mass-flow ratios at a given Mach number and angle of attack; the\n\nmass- flow settings were decided upon during the test after a preliminary\nobservation of the rate of axial force and pressure-recovery variation\nwith the outlet-area changes.\nReduction of Data\nThe t ot al-pres sure ratio H3/Ho) as shown on the graphs) is based\non a value of pitot pressure weighted according to area . This average\nvalue of H3/HO was used in all calculations involving total pressure.\nThe ma ss-flow ratio was calculated from the following relation:\n\nThis equation was derived on the assumption that the flow was inviscid\nand one-dimensional in nature ; with the exception of a correction factor\nC) this relation is identi cal to that given in reference 10. This factor was obtained by testing open-nose inlets of various inlet diameters\noperating with swallowed head shock waves. The factor C was found to\nbe independent of small changes in the velocity profile at the surveyrake station.\nThe external axial force was determined by subtracting from the\nforce measured by the balance the sum of the forces due to (1) the\nchange of momentum and static pressure of the internal flow from the free\nstream to the rake station) (2) the base drag) and (3) the force due to\nbuoyancy. The base drag forces were caused by pressures other than the\nfree-stream static pressure acting on the base of the model and the\nfloating shell. The buoyancy force was considered to equal the integrated product of the local increment in the tunnel static pressure\n(existing between the local and the reference stations in the absence of\na model) and the local differential element of external surface area\nnormal to the model axis. Since the force normal to the model axis was\nnot measured) only the axial-force coefficients are presented. At 0 0\n\nI\n\n8\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\nangle of attack the external axial-force coefficients are equal to the\nexternal drag coefficients which include the cowl drag and drag due to\ndiffusion ahead of the duct entrance.\nAccuracy of Re sults\nThe accuracy of the test results depended principally on the time\ncorrelation as well as the precision of the pressure and force measurements since in many cases the flow through the model was unsteady.\nAlthough the force readings and the photographs of the manometer board\nwere taken simultaneously, the difference in response of the measuring\napparatus to changes in the measured quantities introduced errors of\nmagnitudes determined by the frequency and the amplitude of the variati on. The inaccuracies due to the various causes, together with their\nmaximum cumulative magnitudes estimated in terms of the external axialfor ce coefficient of the model tested, are tabulated as follows:\nI.\n\nSteady-flow conditions (very small and slow variation in Ho)\nA. 20 0 cone\nSource of error:\n\n\xc2\xb1t:.Cn\n\ne\n\n1.

At unsteady flow conditions the accuracy of axial-force measurements was poor.\nFigure 4 shows the results of force measurements made with a 100 _\nsemiangle cone set at 00 angle of attack. This figure also shows the\ntheoretically predicted values of the s hock-wave, or pressure, drag taken\ndirectly from the tables of reference 11 and the frictional d.rag as\nestimated on the basis of the low-epeed skin-friction coefficients given\nIThe ma ss-flow ratio estimates are believed correct t o \xc2\xb11-1/2 percent .\n\nI\n\n2\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\n9\n\nin reference 5, corrected for compressibility by the method of reference\n\n8, and modified for the three-dimensional flow effect as suggested in\nreference 12. All the turbulent skin-friction coefficients were corrected for compressibility using the properties of a ir at the model surface as suggested in reference 7. It is evident that the experimental\nand theoretical pressure-drag coefficients agreed very well, and that\nthe total fore drag of the cone as measured by the balance also agreed\nwithin the expected accuracy with the predicted values of total drag\nbased on the assumption that the boundary layer on the model was laminar.\nThe repeatability and consistency of the results of drag-force measurements indicate that the drag balance performed satisfactorily.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nOpen-Nose Diffusers\nThe variation of the total-pressure ratio and the external axialforce coefficient with mass-flow ratio of model A is shown in figure 5\nfor 0 0 angle of attack at three free-stream Mach numbers. With supersonic flow through the inlet (ml/mo=l.O), the maximum total-pressure\nratios in the settling chamber of model A were 0 . 93 to 0.95 of the theoretical recovery through a normal shock wave. Large transverse pressure\ngradients as a result of transitory separation of flow occurred in the\ndiffuser when the area ratio between the exit and the inlet was increased\nmore than necessary for the entrance of the normal shock wave into the\ninlet. This condition was manifested by the large erratic variations in\nthe readings of the survey rake and was responsible for considerable\nscatter of the for ce data at large area ratios.\nThe external axial- force coefficient of model A increased rapidly at\nall Mach numbers with the emergence of the normal shock to a position\nahead of the inlet; as the mass- flow ratio was reduced to 0.9 from 1.0,\nthe coefficient approximately doubled in magnitude. Unfortunately, the\nwave drag of models A and B operating at mass-flow ratios below 1.0 could\nnot be calculated from the schlieren pictures because the photographs did\nnot cover a sufficiently large part of the head wave (see appendix).\nAt mass- flow ratios less t han the maximum, the portion of the drag\ndue to diffusion (the additive drag) can be obt ained by the method of\nreference 13 . This additive drag is accompanied by a change in the pressures on the external surface of the diffuser (reference 14). In the\npresent tests, these pressures were not measured and the theoretical\nadditive drag coefficients vere simply added to the minimtnn drag coefficients . Thus, the difference betveen the measured and the estimated\ndrag- rise curves is the result of neglecting the change in pressure on\nthe cowl i ng, of experiment al and theoretical inaccura cies, and possibl y\nDENTIAL\n\n10\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\nof a change in the location of the boundary-layer transition region.\nHowever, figure 5 shows that the major portion of the drag rise can be\npredi cted even if these factors are ignored.\nFigure 6 shows the total-pressure ratio and the external axialfor ce-coefficient variation with mass-flow ratio, angle of attack, and\nMach number for model B. The maximum mass-flow ratio at the Mach number\nof 1.4 was only 0.97 because the contraction of the entrance section was\ntoo great to permit the normal shock wave to enter the inlet at that\nspeed or to remain inside the diffuser at Mo = 1.4 after entry at a\nhigher Mach number . The total-pressure ratio and the axial-force coefficient of model B at the Mach number of 1.4 were nearly the same as\nthos e of model A for equal mass-flow ratios. At a Mach number of 1.7\nand higher, the head shock wave entered the inlet. Its position depended\nentirely on the static pressure in the settling chamber of the model,\nand a hysteretic variation of the total-pressure ratio with the mass-flow\nratio was observed. This is indi cated in figure 6 by a peak in the\npressure-recovery curves at m~/ffio=l.O. The maximum total-pressure\nratios of model B were 0.02 to 0.04 higher than those of model A or\napproximately 0.95 to 0.98 of recovery through a normal shock wave. At\nequal mass-flow ratios the external axial-force coefficients of models A\nand B were nearly the same .\nThe effects of the angle of attack on the characteristics of model\nB, as shown in figure 6, were generally small. The external axial-force\ncoefficient seemed to increase wi\nan increase in the angle, but the\ndata were inconclusive because the magnitudes of the measured effects\nwere comparable to experimental scatter.\nFigure 7 shoW13 the variation of the minimum. external axial-force\ncoefficients of models A and B with Mach number at 00 angle of attack;\nit also presents the values of the pressure drag, as predicted by the\nmethod of reference 1, and the laminar and turbulent friction drag calculated from the low-speed skin- friction coeffi cients of reference 5. A\ncompressibility correction to the turbulent skin-fri ction coefficients\nhas been applied as suggested in reference 7J using the properties of air\nat the cowling surface. The laminar fri ction coefficients were corrected\nfor compressibility using the method of reference 8. The calculations\nwere made on the assumption that the frictional force on the external\nsurface of each model (A and B) was equal to that on a flat plate of\nlength and area equal to those of the cowlings.\nThe minimum external axial- force coefficients of model A show good\nagreement with the predi cted values of drag coefficients at all Mach\nnumbers except 2 . 01. A plausible explanation for the high value of the\nexperimental coefficient at Mo=2.01 is provided by the schlieren photographs of figure 8. A mild pressure disturbance may be seen originating\n\nI\n\nL\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\n11\n\non the model at a station located approximately 0.4 of the model length\nfrom the entrance at the higher Mach number. Since this phenomenon\nexisted only at the highest Reynolds number, it is reasonable to assume\nthat it was caused by boundary-layer transition. 2 The drag coefficient\ncalculated on the assumption of laminar boundary layer existing on the\nmodel up to 40 percent of the cowl length, and fully turbulent layer\nfrom there on, agrees fairly well with the measured value. (See fig. 7.)\nBetter agreement would be obtained if the additional wave drag due to\nthe pressure disturbance were not neglected. It should be noted that\nthe Reynolds number based on the length of the laminar portion of the\nboundary layer is quite low for natural transition (Re=1.14 million).\nAs shown in figure 7, the minimum external axial-force coefficient\nof model B at a ~ch number of 1.4 was almost one and one-half times that\nof model A. The increase apparently was due to the spillage around the\ncowling lip caused by the external normal shock wave. At a Mach number\nof 1.5, the higher value of the minimum axial-force coefficient prevailed\nwhen overspeeding (approaching the test Mach number from a higher value)\nwas not used to establish supersonic flow through the inlet. The lower\ncoefficient was obtained for the diffuser when the entrance velocity was\nsupersonic. At ~ch numbers in excess of 1.5 the head shock wave entered\nthe diffuser without overspeeding, and the min~ axial-force coefficients of model B were comparable to those of model A. Schlieren\nphotographs of model B reveal that at the free-stream Mach number of 2.01\ntransition of the boundary layer appears to have occurred at the same\nlocation as that of model A and apparently caused a similar increase in\nthe measured axial-force coefficient.\n\nConical-8hock Diffusers\nThe characteristics of model C are shown in figure 9. It was found\nnecessary to increase the lowest test Mach number to 1.5 in order to\n0\navoid choking the tunnel when the model was set at 9 angle of attack;\nhowever, no difficulty was encountered at Mo=1.4 for a=00.\nThe general characteristics of flow through model C were similar to\nthose through the open-nose diffusers with the exception that a region\nof flow instability was encountered when the mass-flow ratio of model C\nwas reduced below about three-quarters of the maximum possible at the\ngiven Mach number. This condition was caused possibly by the interaction\n2\n\nUnpublished data of tests conducted in the NACA Ames 1- by 3-foot supersonic wind tunnel and the supersonic free-flight tunnel show that mild\npressure waves are generated by the boundary layer undergoing natural\ntransi tion.\n\n12\n\n&1mRIDENTI\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\nbetween the boundary layer and the shock waves on the cone and the back\npressure in the subsonic diffuser (see reference 10)~ or by internal\nflow separation a t the cowling wall resulting from the entrance of a\nvelocity discontinuity sheet as suggested in reference 15.\nThe total-pressure recovery at the Mach number of 1.50 was 0.95 of\nthat through a normal shock wave; at Mo=2.01 it was 10 percent higher\nthan the normal wave recovery. The maximum total pressure measured in\nthe settling chamber of this model at Mo=1. 90 was only 3 percent less\nthan that of the similar model tested at the Lewis Laboratory (MQ=1.85)\nat Reynolds numbers four and one-half times that of model C. These\nmaxima occurred at the same mass-flow ratio. 8\nThe values of the external axial-force coefficient at 0 0 angle of\nattack of model C were about one and a half to two times those of\nmodel A~ probably because of the additive drag due to diffusion ahead\nof the entrance, as discus sed in reference 13. Figure 9 also shows the\nexternal drag coefficients calculated from the schlieren photographs by\nthe method of reference 3~ using an approximation suggested by Nucci of\nthe Langley Laboratory to estimate the drag due to the outer portion of\nthe bow shock wave. (See reference 16 or appendix.) The values shown\nwere calculated using K=l.O and include the drag due to laminar\nfriction calculated on the basis of low-speed skin-friction coefficients\n(reference 5 ) corrected for compressibility (reference 8).\nIn general~ the assumption of laminar boundary-layer flow resulted\nin a fair estimate of the external drag (axial-force coefficient at\n0.,=00 ) through the range of test Mach numbers at maximum mass-flow ratios.\nThe drag coefficients, as calculated from wave photographs~ of the inlet\noperating at a reduced mass flow were low in all cases. The discrepancy\nis probably due to the inaccuracy of calculation caused by insufficient\nlength of the head shock wave visible in the photographs, as discussed\nin the appendix. At a Mach number of 2.01, where transition of the\nboundary layer is most likely to occur (see discussion of models A and\nB)~ and at a reduced mass-flow ratio the difference in drag coefficients\namounts to that which would be caused by transition at 0.6 of the\ncowling length. (See fig. 9(c).) The sum of the minimuJn external axialforce coefficient and the additive drag coefficient, as calculated using\nreference 13, is also shown in figure 9. This approximation apparently\ngives a fair estimate of the external axial-force coefficient at\nmoderately reduced mass-flow rati os.\n3Since the mass-flow ratios as used by the Lewis Laboratory are based on\nthe area fixed by the inle t diame ter and not flow area, the numerical\nvalues of IDl/mo are not identical unless adjusted to a common reference area .\n\nl\nNACA RM A51C12\nThe minimum external axial-force\nin figure 10, increased from 0.047 at\nat MQ=1.7 and then decreased to 0.083\nsistent with that stated in reference\nconstitutes the major portion of wave\nbelow are considered:\n\n13\ncoefficient of model C, as shown\nthe Mach number of 1.4 to 0.097\nat Mo~2.01. This trend is con13 for the additive drag (which\ndrag) when the observations listed\n\n1. At the Mach numbers below 1.9, the normal shock wave remained\noutside the inlet at all mass-flow ratios.\n2. At and above a Mach number of 1.9, the normal shock wave was\ninside the inlet at the maximum flow condition.\nFigure 10 also shows the minimum external-drag or axial-force coefficients at ~Oo of the model tested at the Lewis Laboratory. It is\nevident that a fair agreement exists between the values of external wave\ndrag coefficients of the two models after the frictional drag was subtracted. (See fig. 10.) The discrepancies may be due to the experimental inaccuracies and due to probable slight differences in the lip\nradIi of the two cowlings. Because of the small size of model C, a\nsmall error in the lip shape due to machining may be responsible for a\nlarge portion of the observed difference in the minimum wave-drag coefficients at Mo=2.01. The effects of lip shape are greatest when the\nshape affects the position of the entrance shock wave as is the case at\nmaximum mass-flow ratios when the free-stream Mach number is sufficiently\nhigh.\nVariations in the angle of attack (see fig. 9) showed small effects\non the characteristics of model C at lower Mach numbers. It should be\nnoted that in this case the maximum mass-flow ratio was not affected\nappreciably. However, when the mass-flow ratio decreased 5 percent for\na=9\xc2\xb0 at M =2.01, the total-pressure ratio decreased approximately 6\no\npercent and the minimum axial-force coefficient increased about 60 percent.\nThe characteristics of model D are presented in figure 11. The maximum mass-flow ratio of this model was larger than that of model C\nbecause of a larger cone angle, a larger angle between the model axis\nand the line joining the cone apex and the leading edge of the cowl, and\na sharp lip. The total-pressure ratios of models D and C were nearly the\nsame at the lower Mach numbers; at Mo=2.01 the maximum recovery of\nmodel D was about 5 percent greater .\nThe drag coefficients calculated from schlieren photographs using\nthe same methods as those used in the case of model C also are shown in\nfigure 11. At large mass flows the calculated drag coefficients are in\nfair agreement with the measured values. At all Mach numbers the\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\n14\n\nphotographs showed a smaller portion of the head shock wave than with\nmOdel C, and thus the calculated values of drag were subject to greater\nerror. The drag coefficient (minimQrn plus additive) as calculated using\nreference 13 seems to give a fair estimate of axial-force coefficient at\nreduced mass-flow ratios.\nThe effects of angle of attack on the performance of model D were\nlarge throughout the range of test Mach numbers. The largest effects on\nthe minimum axial-force coefficient were observed at Mo=2.0l. For an\nangle of attack change from 00 to 90 , the max~ mass-flow ratio\ndecreased about 8 percent and caused the minimum force coefficient to\nincrease approximately 20 percent and the max~ total-pressure ratio\nto decrease 8 percent. The reason for the large difference in the external axial-force coefficients at reduced mass-flow ratios (see MQ=1.70\ncurve, fig. 11) is not clearly evident.\nThe variation of the minimum external axial-force coefficient of\nmodel D with the Mach number is shown in figure 12. The trend is\nsimilar to that of model C.\nIn comparing the axial-force coefficients of the various models,\nconsideration should be given to the effects of boundary-layer transiti on. Transition, as indicated by schlieren photographs, is known to\nhave occurred on models A and B at certain test conditions. However,\nthis method of detecting transition is not extremely sensitive and therefore it is possible that transition could have occurred on the rear portion of any of the models tested without being detected. Since the\nfrictional drag constituted a significant portion of the measured axial\nforce, a change in location of transition would have had a pronounced\neffect on the measured force. The frictional drag was not measured\ndirectly and, therefore, the shown variations of the external axialforce coefficients with mass-flow ratio include the effects of changes\nin the boundary layer. This fact may be responsible for at least part\nof the difference between the measured values of external axial-force\ncoefficient at reduced mass-flow ratios and those calculated from\nschlieren photographs, since the boundary layer was assumed to be\nlaminar .\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe performance characteristics of four nose inlets were measured\nin the NACA Ames 8- by 8-inch supersonic wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers\nbetween 0.4 and 0.8 million based on the inlet diameters. The investigation was conducted in the range of Mach numbers between 1.40 and 2.01\nand led to the following conclusions:\n\nNACA\n\nRM A51C12\n\n.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n.. .. ......\n\n_.\n\n15\n\n-\n\nl.

The external axial-force coefficients of the conical-ahock\ninlets using all-external supersonic compression were about one and a\nhalf to two times those of the open-nose inlets with supersonic\nentrances.\n\n3.

The sum of the minimum external axial-force coefficients and\nthe theoretical additive-drag coefficients gave a fair estimate of drag\ncoefficients of inlets tested at reduced mass-flow ratios.\n5. The effects of angles of attack on the pressure recovery were\ngenerally small. The external axial-force coefficients increased\nmeasurably with the angle of attack only in cases where the maximum\nmass-flow ratio decreased with increasing angle.\nAmes Aeronautical Laboratory~\nNational Advisory Committee for\nMoffett Field, Calif.\n\nAeronautics~\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_ __\n\nc\n\n_ __\n\n16\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\nAPPENDIX\nEVALUATION OF DRAG OF AXIALLY SYMMETRIC BODIES\nFROM SHOCK-WAVE PHOTOGRAPHS\n\nWhen the speed of the flow around a body changes from a supersonic\nvelocity in the free stream to a subsonic velocity and then accelerates\nto a supersonic speed again, the mathematical equations that describe\nthe flow behavior change in nature from hyperbolic to elliptic and back\nt o hyperbolic. Since no known analytical methods exist for simultaneously\nsolving hyperbolic and elliptic differential equations with incomplete\nboundary conditions, a laborious method of matching individual solutions\nmust be used. If a photograph of the bow wave ahead of an axially symmetric body at 0 0 angle of attack is available, the wave drag can be\ndetermined through use of any of the following three methods:\n1.\n\nIntegration of the momentum and pressure change between two\ninfinite control planes as in figure 13\n\n2.\n\nIntegration of the entropy rise across the bow shock wave\n\n3.\n\nIntegration of the momentum and pressure change within a closed\nflow region adjacent to the body, the conditions within this\nregion being calculated by the method of characteristics\n\nThese three methods have been proposed i n the references cited\nbelow. It is the purpose of this appendix to review and further clarify\nthe procedures involved by presenting derivations and detailed comments\nnot given previously.\nThe f irst two methods require knowledge of the shape of the wave out\nto the point where its strength is zero, while the third method requires\nonly the portion of the wave bounding the characteristics net ending at\nthe rear of the body. Since in practi ce the entire wave cannot be\nphotographed due to physical limitations, an approximation must be used\nto account for the drag contribution of the unavailable portion of the\nwave in the first two methods; thus the accuracy depends on the exactness\nN th which the decay of the bow wave may be predicted.\ni\nMethod 1: This method was proposed and used in reference 3. A\nschematic drawing of a body and its head shock wave is shown in figure\n13 . The body is assumed to have a blunt nose followed by an infinitely\nlong cylindrical afterbody, so that, neglecting friction, the entire\nbody drag appear s in the detached bow wave.

Although very laborious, this method re~uires a\npicture of the shock wave only extensive enough to complete the characteristics net to the body surface . With such a photograph, this\nmethod is more accurate than the firs t two .\nOf the three methods , t he first two have presupposed a picture of\nthe entire shock wave, or at least that portion of the wave across which\nthe entropy changes significantly. In practice, however, such an extensive picture of a shock wave is generally unobtainable. An approximation is therefore re~uired t o account for the drag contribution of the\nunavailable portion of the wave.\nReferences 18 and 19 suggest a lOOthod for finding the pressure drag\ndue to the portion of the head shock wave bordering the subsonic region\nat the nose of a blunt body. This method approximates the head shock\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\n20\n\nwave by a hyperbola a symptotic to a free-etream Mach wave. In order to\ndetermine if a close estimate of drag due to a complete head shock waVe\ncould be obtained through this method by extrapolation of the hyperbola\nto infinity, the head wave drag of a sphere at three Mach numbers was\ncomput ed. The results shown in figure 14 indicate poor agreement with\nmeasurements of the actual fore drag of spheres. The discrepancy is\nprobably due to the fact that a hyperbola approximates the shape of the\nshock wave well enough only in the section bordering the subsonic region,\nwhile the shape of the outer part of the shock wave depends largely on\nthe shape of the body. Since in the case of a sphere the shock-wave\ncurvature changes continuously, the use of a hyperbola to obtain the\nent ire pr essure drag seemed reasonable. The curvature of a shock wave\nproduce d by a diffuser with a subsonic entrance usually does not change\ncontinuou sly all along its length; therefore the application of a hyperbolic curve is invalid for determination of drag due to a complete wave.\n\nAn approximation, outlined in reference 16, is valuable since it\nobviates need for knowledge of the outermost portion of the wave or the\nconstruction of the characteristics net.

Hence the average pressure ratio K\nlies between (p/Po)G and 1.0. The choice of K = (p/Po)G generally\nresults in an overestimated drag coefficient, while the choice of\nK =\n\n~\n\n[\n\n1+ (p/Po)G ]\n\ngenerally yields an underestimated value of\n\nCUw.\n\nThe fraction of the total drag taken into account by the approximation\nshould be small if good accuracy is desirahle. Thus the value of\n(Cnw)o must be calculated for a maximum span of the bow wave for best\naccuracy .\nBefore applying the above methods to the calculation of the drag of\ndiffuser s , it was decided to test the procedure on spheres, for which an\nexperimental fore-drag curve and excellent wave photographs were available. Figure 14 shows the experimental data from reference 20 and the\ncalculated values of drag. It is evident that the portions of the head\nsho ck waves contained in the photographs from which the wave drag was\ncalculated were insufficient for accurate determination of the drag\ncoefficients. Since the photographs showed the wave shapes up to 15\nsphere radii from the axis of symmetry, it may be concluded that the\nvisible part of the\xc2\xb7 wave must be definitely in excess of this figure.\nThe indicated differences between the drag coefficients calculated by\nthe momentum method (equation (A3)) and the entropy method (equation\n(A5)) are due solely to inaccuracies in calculations and mechanical\nintegrations. The approximation outlined in reference 16, when applied\nto the drag curve of figure 14 as calculated by the momentum method,\nyields a much better estimate of the drag coefficients. However, to\nobtain this agreement it was necessary to use for K the full value of\npressure ratio a cross the oblique shock wave at the extreme y/r visible\non the photograph.\nApplication of the method of characteristics, as outlined in refe~\nence 4, to the flow around a l-inch-diameter sphere at a Mach number of\n3, proved unsuccessful. The characteristics net could not be completed\nfrom the shock wave to the sphere because of extremely slow convergence\nof the Mach net toward the sphere. The schlieren photographs of spheres\nused for drag calculations were taken in the Ames 1- by 3-foot supersonic\nwind tunnels No. 1 and No.2.\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\nThe experience of calculating drag from wave photographs led to a\nfew observations which may aid in future work:\n1. The photograph of the wave must be clear, accurate, and extensive , in excess of 15 maximum body radii if possible. Shadowgraph\n\n23\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\npictures are preferable to schlieren photographs because of better definition of the head-wave curvature near the leading edges of cowlings;\na small error in the apparent curvature of the wave innnediately adjacent\nto the lip of a cowling of small angle may result in a large error in\nthe calculated drag.\n2.\n\nsphere at\n\nThe\n\nfre~tream\n\nMo = 1.520\n\nMach number must be accurately known (for a\n\xc2\xb10.004, 6 CD = \xc2\xb10.01).\nw\n\n3. The position of the body should be such that the head wave it\ncreates does not intersect any other pressure disturbances which may be\npresent in the tunnel (e.g., shock or expansion waves created by tunnelwall imperfections, model support, etc.).\n\n4. The methods are not applicable to the calculation of drag of a\nbody the cross-\xc2\xa3ection of which continually increases within the field\nof view. In this case, a large portion of the drag would have to be\nestimated by meahs of the approximation sugges ted by Nucci, and the\nerror in calculated drag coefficient would be large.\n5. A body of revolution may yaw slightly without disturbing the\nsymmetry of the detached head shock wave; consequently, the wave axis of\nsymmetry rather than the body axis should be used as the x axis. The\ncalculated drag coefficient must be resolved in such cases in the direction of the body axis t o obtain the axial-force coefficient.\n\nNACA RM A51C12\n\n24\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nBrown, Clinton E. , and Parker, Hermon M.: A M3thod for the\nCalculation of External Lift, Moment, and Pressure Drag of\nSlender Open-Nose Bodies of Revolution at Supersonic Speeds.\nNACA Rep. 808, 1945.\n\n2.\n\nFerri, Antonio: Application of the Method of Characteristics to\nSupersonic Rotational Flow.
