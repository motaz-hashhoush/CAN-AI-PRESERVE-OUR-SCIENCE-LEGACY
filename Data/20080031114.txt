Human perception of rattle can be\nnegative that is a motivating factor of the current research effort to study sonic boom induced\nwindow rattle. A rattle study has been conducted on residential houses containing windows of\ndifferent construction at a variety of geographic locations within the United States. Windows in\nthese houses were excited by a portable, high-powered loudspeaker and enclosure specifically\ndesigned to be mounted on the house exterior to cover an entire window. Window vibration was\nmeasured with accelerometers placed on different window components. Reference microphones\nwere also placed inside the house and inside of the loudspeaker box. Swept sine excitation was\nused to identify the vibration threshold at which the response of the structure becomes non-linear\nand begins to rattle. Initial results from this study are presented and discussed. Future efforts will\ncontinue to explore the rattle occurrence in windows of residential houses exposed to sonic\nbooms.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nCurrent Federal Aviation Administration regulations prohibit commercial supersonic flights over\nUS land and restrict military flights to high altitudes or specially designated airspaces. Such\nregulations are required because sonic booms from existing aircraft are found to be unacceptable\nby the public. Shaping an airframe can reduce the loudness of booms heard outdoors1. There are,\nhowever, additional effects inside of the house that contribute to overall disturbance. According\nto past surveys2, rattle is one of the most annoying factors for people experiencing sonic booms\nindoors.\na\n\nEmail address:\nEmail address:\nc\nEmail address:\nd\nEmail address:\nb\n\nnatalia.sizov@wyle.com\ntroy.schultz@wyle.com\nchris.hobbs@wyle.com\nj.klos@nasa.gov\n\nThis current effort expands upon related rattle studies conducted in the mid 1960\xe2\x80\x99s3. During\npast studies the threshold excitation level was found in terms of the exterior sound pressure\nlevel3, 4, or the acceleration levels of walls and other building elements5. During an experimental\nstudy of the rattle of wall-hung mirror carried out by Carden and Mayes 6 a sinusoidal excitation\nwas applied at wall resonance frequency of 15 Hz. Several past rattle studies have utilized\ndifferent acoustical excitation sources such as steady state sound7 or vibration, aircraft noise,\nblast noise and other impulsive noises, which are dominated by low-frequency content8. The\ndevelopment of rattle prediction models based on these data was initially attempted to model the\nacceleration level for the threshold of rattle of wall-hung objects and objects on horizontal\nsurfaces9. Early publications found a wide range of rattle threshold values which varied between\n0.01g4 to 1g9 depending on material, sizes, age, outdoor overpressure, frequency and method of\nstudy.\nThe current paper presents initial results of a NASA sponsored project to study window\nrattle mechanisms, and to model the rattle occurrence caused by sonic boom excitation. The\nfoundation of this research is the collection of vibroacoustic response data on a wide variety of\nwindows in existing residential houses. A focus of this work to date was the experimental\ndetermination of rattle threshold of the different windows. This paper describes the methods used\nand some initial findings.\n2. RATTLE THRESHOLD MESUREMENTS\nMore than 40 windows were tested for their response to airborne low-frequency sound. These\nincluded windows of different types, material, and sizes in houses of different constructions.\nWindows were located in houses near airports in New Hampshire, Virginia and Pennsylvania.\nThe owners of these houses were participating in FAA sponsored sound insulation program.\nWyle\xe2\x80\x99s involvement with this sound insulation program made these windows available for the\nresearch that is the focus of this paper. Shortly after the rattle experiments reported in this paper\nthe tested windows were removed and replaced with new windows. Some of the removed\nwindows were retained for future laboratory tests.\nA new portable sonic boom simulator was built to study the vibration of windows exposed\nto sonic booms and other types of acoustic excitations (Figure 1). It consists of two connected\nmodules, a small 0.9x0.3x0.6 m module and a large 1.4x1.2x0.5 m module. The small module\nhas an open back and contains two 15\xe2\x80\x9d full rage JBL 2226 speakers. The simulator was made of\n12 mm-thick Baltic birch and weights less than 200 pounds. The simulator was placed outside of\nthe house, covering the tested window and was pressed firmly against the wall. When in position\nthe large module forms an enclosed acoustic cavity between the speakers and the exterior surface\nof the window. The large module is lined with poly-foam to damp the acoustic resonances of the\nair cavity and increase the spatial uniformity of the sound field acting on the window. The\nsimulator is capable of generating a sound level above 140 dB (4 psf). Transient and steady state\nexcitations were studied, and results for sinusoidal excitations are presented here.\nAccelerometers were mounted to the windows and house walls at various locations.\nLightweight PCB model 353B17 and Endevco model 2250A-10 accelerometers, with 10 mV/g\nsensitivities, were used on structural elements where mass loading was a concern. For structural\nelements where mass loading was not a concern, PCB model 356A27 accelerometers with\n100mV/g sensitivity were used. Accelerometers were placed on the interior glass, sash, and\nframe of all tested windows. As an example, Figure 2 shows accelerometer mounting positions\nfor one of the double-hung wooden frame window. Accelerometers were placed on the:\nlow corner of upper glass panel (channel 3),\nmiddle of upper glass panel (channel 4),\n\ncenter of upper glass panel, low level (channel 5),\nupper frame middle (channel 6),\nupper corner of upper sash (channel 7),\ncenter of upper horizontal sash of the low panel (channel 8), and\nmiddle of left vertical sash of upper panel (channel 9).\nTo measure the acoustic excitation and response, Br\xc3\xbcel and Kj\xc3\xa6r Type 4193 low frequency\nmicrophones were placed at the three locations:\ninside the large module of the simulator (channel 10),\ninside the house in the room where the window was located (channel 11), and\noutside the house behind the speaker (channel 12).\nResponse data were recorded on a National Instruments 24-bit digital recording system at a\nsample rate of 96 kHz.\nThe rattle threshold of the windows was determined by exciting them acoustically using\namplitude swept sinusoidal signals at discrete frequencies ranging from 10 to 500 Hz. The\nexcitation was produced using a signal generator, the output of which was passed through an\namplifier to drive the speakers of the simulator. To create the amplitude sweep the signal\ngenerator\xe2\x80\x99s output voltage was gradually increased by an operator. Figure 3 shows an example of\nthe sound pressure measured inside the simulator for a manual amplitude sweep of a 50 Hz tone.\nAs the test was performed the sound pressure level measured by a microphone placed inside the\nsimulator varied from low level to a maximum level of 189 Pa (140 dB, or 4 psf), then back to\nlow level. For improved repeatability, the procedure was eventually improved to use computergenerated signals instead of manual manipulation of a signal generator\xe2\x80\x99s output level.\n\nFigure 1: Sonic boom simulator\n\nFigure 2: Accelerometer position inside the house\n(house #226, window W6)\n\n3. RESULTS\nFigures 4 through 6 and 8 show portions of the recorded time history of an accelerometer,\nchannel 8, which is located at the center of the upper horizontal sash of the lower windowpane\n(Figure 2). These data are for window W6 in a house # 226. During this test rattle first occurred\nat 3.4 seconds at an acceleration level of about 1.5 m/s2. On Figure 4 points were rattle first\noccurred are marked by arrows. The rattle continued as the amplitude was increased. The sound\npressure level reached the maximum 19 seconds into the test (Figure 3), which produced very\nhigh acceleration levels and significant rattle (Figure 5). As the excitation amplitude was\ndecreased, rattle subsided 34 seconds into the test at an acceleration level of approximately 1.5\nm/s2 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 3: Outside pressure amplitude\n(50 Hz , channel 10, house # 226, window W6)\n\nFigure 4: Time history of acceleration, rattle onset\n(50 Hz, channel 8, house # 226, window W6)\n\nFigure 5: Acceleration time history, at the maximum\nexcitation (50 Hz, channel 8, house # 226, window W6)\n\nFigure 6: Time history of acceleration, rattle cessation\n(50 Hz, channel 8, house # 226, window W6)\n\nThese test demonstrate that contact induced vibration is not present at low excitation levels\nand the window responds sinusoidally to a sinusoidal excitation. As the excitation level increases\nand rattle begins, the window response begins to exhibits non-linear behavior. The excitation\nlevel first causing contact induced vibration is defined as the rattle onset threshold. Once this\nthreshold is exceeded, contact induced vibration became evident in the measured responses and\nthe rattle noise became audible indoors. The point when rattle cased- rattle offset- was also\nidentified from time domain responses.\n\nInspection of the time domain responses is labor intensive. Given the large number of\nwindows that must be analyzed, other methods to quickly identify rattle onset and offset were\nsought. When contact induced vibration is present in the window the response of the window to a\nsinusoidal input is not sinusoidal. In the spectral domain, these nonlinearities in the window\nresponse will appear as harmonics of the fundamental excitation tone. Mapping the amplitude of\nthe fundamental and the harmonics has proven useful in identifying the onset and offset of rattle.\nThe spectrogram of the time history from channel 8 is shown in Figure 7. Fundamental and\nhigher order harmonics are distinguishable. Changes in the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of\nhigher order harmonics are visible as the vertical lines occurring at about 3, 8, 12, 30 and 34\nseconds. The effects associated with these times are best understood by examining the time\nhistories. As it was noted above, the time of 3.4 seconds corresponds to rattle onset, and the time\nof 34 seconds corresponds to rattle offset. There are multiple thresholds of the window, for\nexample, figure 8 illustrates how the rattle increases in intensity as the excitation level increases\n12 seconds into the test.\n\nFigure 7: Spectrogram\n(50 Hz, channel 8, house # 226, window W6)\n\nFigure 8: Time history of acceleration, at 12 seconds\n(50 Hz, channel 8, house # 226, window W6)\n\nThe increase in the amplitude of the power spectrum at the fundamental frequency as test\nprogressed is shown in Figure 9. On Figures 10 through 12 the amplitude of the fundamental\nharmonic is shown on the abscissas, and the amplitude ratio of higher order harmonics to the\nfundamental is shown on the ordinates. Two curves are presented, one for the case when the\nexcitation level was increasing and one for the case when it was decreasing. When the\nfundamental reached a certain level the relative amplitude of higher order harmonics began to\nincrease rapidly (Figure 10 and 12). Nonlinear vibration causes this rapid increase in the\namplitude ratio, and this rapid increase can be used as an indicator of rattle onset. For example,\nin Figures 10, 11 and 12 a rapid increase began when the fundamental PSD amplitude was\napproximately 0.3 m2/(s4-Hz). Referring back to Figure 9, the time at which the fundamental\nharmonic reached an amplitude of 0.3 m2/(s4-Hz) was between 3 and 4 seconds into the test. This\ntime was previously identified as the moment of rattle onset based on the time history shown in\nFigure 4 and the spectrogram shown in Figure 7. Thus, a quantitative measure of rattle onset can\n\nbe developed from the experimental data by comparing the relative amplitude of the higher order\nharmonics to the amplitude of the fundamental.\n\nFigure 9: Fundamental harmonic time history,\n(50 Hz, channel 8, house # 226, window W6)\n\nFigure 10: Ratio of first harmonic PSD vs fundamental\nharmonic PSD, (channel 8, house # 226, window W6)\n\nFigure 11: Ratio of third harmonic PSD vs fundamental\nharmonic PSD, (channel 8, house # 226, window W6)\n\nFigure 12: Ratio of forth harmonic PSD vs fundamental\nharmonic PSD, (channel 8, house # 226, window W6)\n\nFrom Figures 10 and 11 it is seen that another dramatic increase in the amplitude of the\nhigher order harmonics relative to the fundamental occurred when the fundamental reaches an\namplitude of 1 m 2/(s4-Hz). This corresponds to a time of 12 seconds in Figure 9, and also appears\nas vertical line in the spectrogram (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 13: Rattle threshold for different window elements (house # 226, window W6)\n\nFrom Figures 10, 11, and 12 that the excitation amplitude which induces a change in the\nstate of rattle is different depending on whether the excitation amplitude is increasing or\ndecreasing. For example, the moment of rattle onset corresponded to an excitation level of\napproximately 36 Pa (125 dB, or 0.77 psf). As the amplitude of the excitation was decreasing,\nthe rattle offset corresponded to an excitation pressure in the enclosure of 27 Pa (123 dB, or 0.57\npsf). There are two possible causes of this behavior. It is possible that less energy is required to\nsustain rattle when the excitation amplitude is decreasing. Another possible cause of this is the\nwindow components that are rattling may have displaced to a new position which has a different\nrattle threshold.\nThe rattle threshold, or the excitation level which causes the onset of rattle, varied\ndepending on which window element was analyzed. The resulting temporal acceleration\nresponses also had different patterns depending on the locations of the accelerometer. For\nexample, the middle of the glass panel tended to exhibit a clear sinusoidal response and contact\nwas not detected until very high excitation levels. For some windows rattle was not detected at\nall in the windowpane. For other parts of the window contact was detected at much lower\nexcitation levels. In window corner non-liner response was recorded during the entire\nmeasurement duration starting immediately at the beginning. Figure 13 shows the threshold\nestimates for different window parts from house # 226. Here and in Figure 14 the ordinate\nindicates the acceleration level when rattle was first detected during each amplitude swept sine\ntest and the abscissa indicates the fundamental excitation frequency. No measurements were\ntaken at 70 or 80 Hz for this window. The channels indicated in the legend of Figure 13\ncorrespond to the accelerometer locations shown in Figure 2. At low frequencies, below 45 Hz,\nrattle was present when test just initiated and threshold estimates at these frequencies are\nindicated here by zeros (Figure 13 and 14). It can be seen from these data that the threshold at\nwhich rattle detected varied significantly from element to element.\n\nA database of responses from more than 40 windows was collected. Some windows had\nstorm windows and some had screens. The presence of those affected the measured vibration\nresponse. It was found that when window has a storm or a screen its rattle threshold is higher.\nIt should be noted that rattle threshold also varied from house to house. Figure 14 gives\nexamples of threshold acceleration level for three double hung windows located in two different\nhouses and variations in the threshold can be seen. At the house # 208, the window was tested\nwith and without storm window in place. At the house #226 the window was tested with and\nwithout the screen in place. Channel 8 was always located in the position illustrated in Figure 2.\nChannel 5 was positioned just above it on the windowpane (Figure 2). The threshold is frequency\ndependent at low frequencies small acceleration levels induced rattle. A local maximum is found\naround 60-100 Hz, which is consistent with other earlier findings9. This would indicate that\nhigher acceleration levels are required to induce rattle at these frequencies.\n\nFigure 14: Rattle threshold for different houses, measured on frames (Channel 8)\nand glass (Channel 5).\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper describes an experimental methodology that was used to determine the rattle\nthreshold of residential house windows by subjecting them to sinusoidal acoustic excitation. For\nthis testing a portable excitation device was built that mounts to the outside of the house. The\nmethod is based on experimentally detecting the onset of rattle while gradually increasing\namplitude of a pure tone excitation. The technique was used on many windows located in houses\nthat are part of an FAA sponsored noise insulation program. Inspection of the time domain and\nspectral analysis are used to predict rattle onset and offset. From the analyses of the large\nnumbers of windows tested, it was demonstrated that different threshold levels are found in\ndifferent houses, different windows at the same house and the same window with and without\nscreen or storm windows. It was also shown how different window parts exhibit different\n\nthreshold levels. These conclusions illustrate that a range of rattle thresholds can be expected\nover the variety of houses that may be exposed to sonic booms if supersonic overland flight were\nallowed.\nResults of this study will be used in further investigation of rattle mechanisms and the\ndevelopment of tools for predicting rattle response of windows exposed to sonic booms.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was funded by NASA Langley Research Center, Contract number NNL05AA04Z.\nREFERENCES\n1\n\nBuehrle, R.D., Klos, J., Sullivan, B.M., and Haering, E.A..
