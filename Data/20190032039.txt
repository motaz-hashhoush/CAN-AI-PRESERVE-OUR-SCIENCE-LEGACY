It includes all the rocks, gravel, and dust \xe2\x80\x93 from large\nboulders to tiny particles. It exists on Earth, other planets,\nmoons, and asteroids.\nSwamp Works is exploring ways to exploit the regolith for as\nmany uses as possible. We take one of two approaches:\n1. Extracting resources out of the regolith, usually with\nchemical processes\n2. Using the regolith as a raw material for building structures\n\nNASA Photo\n\nBasalt Granular Material =\nConstruction Aggregate\nAPOLLO 16\n\nAPOLLO 12\n\nNASA Image / MSFC\n\nJPL ATHLETE Robot\n\nSolar Power\nConcentrators\n\nNASA Innovative Advanced Concept (NIAC), Contour Crafting Image\n\nKSC Print Head\n& Regolith Feed\nSystem\n\nNASA Image\n\nNASA Innovative Advanced Concept (NIAC), Contour Crafting Image\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 3D Printing (or Additive\nManufacturing) is the process of\nconstructing a 3D object by\ndepositing material layer by layer\nbased on a digital part file\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Advantages of 3D Automated\nAdditive Construction (3DAAC):\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Removes design constraints\n(\xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing for design\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Enables building and testing\nearlier in project lifecycle\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ability to work with new\nmaterial formulations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maximize use of in situ\nresources (planetary surface)\n\nPhoto by Mike Jazdyk,\nU.S. Army Engineer\nResearch and\nDevelopment Center\n\nAdditive Construction with Mobile Emplacement\n(ACME)\nThe USACE had the following objectives for construction of a Barracks B-hut in a\nforward base:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reduce construction time from 4-5 days to 1 day per structure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reduce construction personnel requirements from 8 to 3 per structure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reduced logistics impacts associated with materials shipped, personnel, and\nresources to sustain the structures and personnel\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Decrease material shipped from out of theater from 5 tons to less than 2.5 tons\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Improved energy performance of the envelope from less than R1 to greater\nthan R15\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reduced sustainment (logistics) and operations/maintenance personnel\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reduce construction waste from 1 ton to less than 500 pounds\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Improved security during construction\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Improved local population acceptance by mimicking local construction\n\nAdditive Construction with Mobile Emplacement\n(ACME)\n\nDry Good Storage Subsystem\n\nLiquid Storage Subsystem\n\nContinuous Feedstock Mixing Delivery Subsystem (CFDMS)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAccumulator\nPump Trolley\nGantry\nHose Management\nNozzle\nElectrical & Software\n\nDry Goods &\nLiquid Goods\nparked on side\nand mix in trolley\n\nDry Goods Delivery System\nAutomated Dispensing of Gravel, Coarse Sand, Fine Sand & Cements\n\nLiquid Goods Delivery System\nAutomated Dispensing of Water & Additives\n\nDry & Liquid Goods Automated Dispensing\n\n5 Liquid\nDischarge Pipes\nDry Goods in Weigh Hopper\n\nDry Materials Discharge\n\nRobotic Gantry Positioning Mechanism\nGantry 3D Printer Concept\n\nRobotic Gantry Positioning Mechanism\nRobotic Gantry 3D Printer: As Built\n\nNASA /Army Photo\n\nRobotic Gantry 3D Printer: As Built\n\nNASA/Army Photo\n\n32\xe2\x80\x99 x 18\xe2\x80\x99 x 8.5\xe2\x80\x99\n\nUS Army Photo\n\nVideo of Automated Construction\n26\n\nNASA Photos\n\nNASA Photo\n\nhttp://basalt.today/2017/11/13571/\n\nhttp://slideplayer.com/slide/10453626/\n\n3D PRINTING : REGOLITH &POLYMERS\n\nNASA Photos\n\nNASA Photos\n\nNASA Video\n\nNASA Photo\n\nPLASTIC TRASH\n\nLOCAL SOIL\n\n3D PRINTED\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nFig 1.
