This process was developed by\nresearchers at NASA Langley to specifically address needs for aerospace applications. Additive\nmanufacturing technologies like EBF3 enable efficient design of materials and structures by tailoring\nmicrostructures and chemistries at the local level to improve performance at the global level. Additive\nmanufacturing also facilitates design freedom by integrating assemblies into complex single-piece\ncomponents, eliminating flanges, fasteners and joints, resulting in reduced size and mass. These same\nefficiencies that permit new design paradigms also lend themselves to supportability and sustainability.\nLong duration space missions will require a high degree of self-sustainability. EBF3 is a candidate\ntechnology being developed to allow astronauts to conduct repairs and fabricate new components and\ntools on demand, with efficient use of feedstock materials and energy.\n\n'
