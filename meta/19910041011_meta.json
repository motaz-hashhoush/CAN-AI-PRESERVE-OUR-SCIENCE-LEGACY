Liquidus temperatures for chondrules from unequilibrated chondrites are calculated using Herzberg's (1979) method. The paper then infers whether each chondrule formed above, at, or below its liquidus based on textures produced in experiments. A range of temperatures to which chondrules may have been initially heated is then derived from the texture-composition-temperature relationships. Finally, the role of dust seeding, or external heterogeneous nucleation, in producing chondrule textures is examined.", "title": "Temperature conditions for chondrule formation", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T18:41:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910041011, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hewins, Roger H."}, "organization": {"name": "Rutgers Univ.", "location": "New Brunswick, NJ, United States"}}, "id": "99f316fbec4e4fa3b94b8f4da45bc021"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910041011, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Radomsky, Patrick M."}, "organization": {"name": "Rutgers University", "location": "New Brunswick, NJ, United States"}}, "id": "e50c0bb1acc744a9bf38655478de1512"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910041011, "publications": [{"volume": "25", "submissionId": 19910041011, "issn": "0026-1114", "id": "c93238e4579d476799168c2c5ecea8a0", "publicationName": "Meteoritics", "publicationDate": "1990-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
