With the first flight\nof the Space Shuttle a few months hence, we will cross a major\nthreshold in the space program . In its operational lifetime, which\nwill span the 1980s, the Shuttle will introduce revolutionary changes :\nroutine access to the space environment for experimenters as well as\nfor spacecraft and sensors; a minimum-g flight profile, notably\nreducing stress during launch and ascent and thereby reducing the\nspecial preparation formerly required for both people and hardware; and the potential for servicing expensive payloads in orbit or\nretrieving them for overhaul on the ground.\nMore subtle, and yet perhaps more important in the long run,\nare the changes in attitude that will accompany the new freedom of\naccess to the space environment. Our present concept of space is\nforbidding: machines and humans are surrounded by hostile conditions that constantly threaten catastrophe, limiting many space\nactivities to brief, one-shot excursions. The Space Transportation\nSystem will alter this concept through the confidence that comes\nfrom repetition and familiarity. Consider, for example, our altered\nconcept of the moon . Before the Apollo landings , the moon was for\nus much the same image that humans had shared since antiquity-a\nremote, cold, somewhat romantic body. Our intellect told us it was\nintimately linked with the earth, but our emotions felt it was distant\nand unattainable. The first "giant step for mankind" was in the\ncategory of exciting derring-do. We were proud of the achievement;\nhumans had done what they had never been able to do before. But it\nwas the landings that followed, with extensive televised explorations\nof the lunar surface, that made the moon a familiar place, there for us\nto return to whenever we wished.\nSuch a familiarity with the space environment is what the Space\n\nI\n\nl\n\nvii\n\nVIII\n\nORDERS OF MAG\n\nITUDE\n\nTransportation System will confer upon the human race. Frequent,\nroutine flights; crews performing normal jobs in security and comfort; flight vehicles that are refueled, reloaded, and flown again many\ntimes-all these are comfortable analogs to transportation modes\nand operations that we are familiar with in our daily lives.\nAccess and familiarity will make space useful in much the ame\nway that Conestoga wagons and the railroads made possible the\nmass settlement of the American continent, and as transport aircraft\nin only a few years made mass air travel a fact of everyday life.\nReliable transportation negates or minimizes the liabilities of the\nenvironment; having done this, it opens up the way for use of the\nunique aspects of that environment.\nWhich brings us to the third, or serendipity, level of change that\nthe Space Transportation System will generate. Once the system is in\noperation, I have confidence that uses will materialize that were\nnever seriously considered-perhaps not even envisioned-by the\nplanners and designers. These may be the real building blocks of\nprogress.\nBecause this sequence of radical changes is in the offing, it is well\nto pause at the threshold and reflect on what went before and how we\ncarne to be at this juncture.\nNovember 1980\n\nRobert A. Frosch\nAdministrator\n\nPreface\nFor some years the NASA History Office was embarrassed by a\nthin but steady stream of requests for copies of a brief history of\nNASA. Again and again we had to say that none existed. There had\nbeen one once, back in 1965, when Eugene M. Emme, NASA historian, wrote a Historical Sketch of NASA (EP-29). But it had been\nout of print for several years and by now was outdated enough to discourage a reprint. The project of a new short history kept nagging at\nour collective conscience, but we were busy with other things. It was\nnot hard to convince ourselves that we just couldn\'t stretch our staff\nresources that much.\nThen in 1974 that persuasive imperative, necessity, tookahand.\nThe American Public Works Association, armed with the blessing of\na joint congressional re olution, was preparing a bicentennial\nvolume of the history of 200 year of public works in the United\nStates. Association officers asked NASA Administrator James C.\nFletcher to have a chapter prepared on the aeronautics and space\nprograms. Dr. Fletcher agreed; the project was assigned to our office.\nSo now it would be done; the only question was whether someone in\nthe office would do it or whether we would contract for a manuscript. Mindful of our long-felt need for a similar manuscript, I\nvolunteered. The bicentennial volume got its chapter and here,\nrevised and somewhat enlarged, is the NASA version. Now, since the\nfirst two printings seem to have found a rather diverse audience and\nour stock of copies has been exhausted, it seems useful to bring it up\nto date .\nBecause of the purpose for which it was originally written, it\ncontains no reference notes and only a generalized bibliography. So\nI cannot blame the sources for errors or deficiencies; they are of my\nown cobbling.\nOctober 1980\n\nF.W.A.\n\nix\n\n1\n\nRise of Aeronautics\nIn 1913 the clouds of war were gathering over Europe and casting their shadows on America. The European powers were racing to\narm themselves against each other, not only with conventional land\nand sea armaments, but also with the new weapon of the 20th century, the airplane. In their race they overcame the U.S. lead established by the Wright brothers and left this country in a technological\nbackwash. Particularly disturbing to American observers was our\nprimitive and unorganized aeronautical establishment-a frail\nshadow of the research facilities and government-subsidized industries arising in Europe.\nMost active among the small group of concerned men in the\nUnited States was the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,\nCharles D. Walcott. Convinced that the situation called for federal\nsponsorship of an aviation organization, he worked hard selling the\nidea both inside and outside the government. After several false\nstarts, he succeeded. On 3 March 1915, President Woodrow Wilson\nsigned into law a Navy appropriations bill with a rider establishing an\nindependent Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The munificent\nsum of $5000 was appropriated for the committee\'s first year\'s\noperations .\nThe new committee was unique in organizational structure,\nthough in years to come it was to serve as a model for several others.\nTwelve presidentially appointed members, serving without pay,\ndrawn from the military and scientific sides of government and from\nthe scientific community at large, were charged "to supervise and\ndirect the scientific study of the problems offlight, with a view to their\npractical solution" and to "direct and conduct research and experiments in aeronautics ."\nFirst among the tasks of the committee was to find the dimensions of the problem. The members set out to survey the state of\naeronautics in the United States. If their purpose had been to justifY\ntheir existence, they would have found the results amply rewarding.\nAviation was generally regarded as a daredevil sport practiced by a\n\n2\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nhandful of wealthy young men. Aeronautical research was virtually\nnonexistent. Only two American universities offered courses in\naeronautical engineering. Research facilities such as wind tunnels\nwere pitifully few in number and unsystematized in use. The\naviation "industry" was a scattered collection of small handicraft\nshops. The military services had bought only a few dozen airplanes\nin the brief history of aviation, and nearly all of them were fatally\nobsolete by current European standards. And finally, none of the\nwork in aeronautics within the government (located in the Weather\nBureau, the Bureau of Standards, and the military services) and in the\ncivil sector was coordinated. Clearly a federal laboratory for aeronautical research was urgently needed.\nArmy, Navy, and the committee considered establishing ajoint\nresearch center. Since the War Department had funds for acquiring\nreal estate, it bought a tract ofland on the Back River near Hampton,\nVirginia. The intent was to colocate the aeronautical research facilities of the two military services and the committee. Realities of war\nintervened, however; the War Department left its research at\nMcCook Field in Dayton, Ohio (later Wright Field, now WrightPatterson Air Force Base); the Navy located its facility in Norfolk,\nVirginia. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics already acronymed NACA-went ahead with construction. Even so\nit was too late for the laboratory to assist the war effort. Not until\n11 June 1920 was the three-building complex-one of them a wind\ntunnel with a 1.5-meter test section-formally dedicated as the\nLangley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory (named for Samuel P.\nLangley, aeronautical pioneer).\nFROM WAR TO WAR\n\nDuring the 1920s the new laboratory took form and substance.\nThe needed theoretical base for scientific study of aeronautics was\nimported from Europe, and NACA staffed the laboratory slowly and\ncarefully. A conscious decision was made to concentrate on the systematic study of aerodynamics - the interactions between the threedimensional airspace and the shape and characteristics of a body\nmoving through it-as the most needed of the many areas of\nresearch in aeronautics. Additional research facilities were built,\ncarefully tailored to that purpose. Most of the credit for this hard\nfocus and foresight should go to two dedicated members of the\ncommittee, Joseph S. Ames of Johns Hopkins University and\nJerome C. Hunsaker of the Navy\'s Bureau of Aeronautics.\n\n~~~--\n\n- --\n\n- --\n\n-~-\n\n--\n\n-- --\n\nA H [STO RY OF N ACA A\n\nD\n\nASA, [ 9 [5- 198 0\n\n3\n\nBy the end of the d ecade the fledgling NACA had achieved\nimpressive results , recognized at hom e and abroad . In 1929 a distinguished British engineer d eclared: "The only people so far who\nhave been able to get at something like accurate res ults from wind\ntunnel experiments are the workers at the experim ental station at\nLangley Field ." In the same year a British engineering journal went\nfurth er:\nThey [th e Langley group] were rhe firsr ro esrab lish , and indeed ro visualize, a\nvariable-densi ry runn el; they have led again with rhe co n [rucri o n of the\ntwenty-foot pro peller research tunnel; and sreps are now being ra ken ro provide a " fu ll -scal e" runnel in which co mpl ete aeropl ane up to Lhirty- llve-foor\nspan can be tesred.

Much of this sure rise to ascendency in U.S. aeronautical research derived from the selection of\nGeorge W. Lewis, professor of m echanical engineering at Swarthmore College, as director of aeronautical research .Joining NACA in\n1919, Dr. Lewis for the next 26 years planned the research program,\napportioned th e money, and hired and trained the peo ple in\nNACA.\nThe great d epression that swept the United States in 1929\nproved a boon to NACA in at least two senses. First, additional\nresearch facilities could be constructed at low depression prices\n(mostly with pump-priming money from th e Public Works Administration ); second, government salaries and the up-to-date research\nfacilities suddenly were very attractive to promising young engineers. Thus, in 193 1, the 9- by I8-meter " full scale" wind tunnel ,\nthen the largest in the world, was co mpleted at a cost of$900 000; the\nThe Jull-scale wind tunnel at Langley, completed in 1931.\n\nA HI STORY OF NACA A\n\n0 NASA , 19 15- 1980\n\n5\n\n61 O-meter-Iong towing tunnel was also finish ed that year. More wind\ntunnels were added in the mid-30s, and from a total staff of 181\npeople in 1930, NACA grew to 523 by 1939. Painstakingly and systematically the researchers charted out the family of NACA wing\nshapes that would shortly lift military an d civil aircraft allover the\nworld. As aircraft speeds rose, new aerodynamic problems had to be\nsolved. Stalls and sp in s, treacherous problems that had caus ed a\nfourth of all aircraft accidents, were explored, und erstood, and\nlargely co untered.\nBy 1936 NACA officials became aware of two interconnected\nproblems looming on the hori zon: (1) European nations were again\nrapidly building new research facilities; (2) room for growth was\nlimited at Langley. Once more American leadership in aeronauti cs\nwas challenged to expand its research base . As more evidence came\nin, the concern became alarm. In 1938, a special comm ittee on\nexpanded faciliti es was form ed, and it recommended the immediate\ncreation of a second aeronautical research center, this one in California. The new laboratory was authorized by Congress in 1939 . Less\nthan a month later, on 14 September, ground was broken at Moffett\nField, aN avy airfield 64 kilometers south of San Francisco, for what\nPart of the extensive facilities\n\nof the Langley Research\n\nCenter, 196 7.\n\n6\n\nORDERS OF MAG ITUDE\n\nwou ld become the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory (named after\nJoseph S. Ames, president of Johns Hopkins University, charter\nmember and from 1927 to 1939 the dedicated chairman ofNACA).\nThe most impressive physical structure was the huge 12- by 24-meter\nwind tunnel, which dwarfed its parent "full-scale" tunnel at Langley.\nAlso a beginning was made on an impressive array of high-speed\nresearch facilities.\nBut this was not enough; the war had begun in Europe on 1 September. On 19 October 1939, a second special committee, this one\nheaded by Charles A. Lindbergh who had annually surveyed\nEuropean aviation progress for the Army Air Corps, urgently recommended the building of a third laboratory, this one to specialize\nin research on aircraft power plants. InJune 1940 Congress agreed.\nA site was made available at the Cleveland municipal airport, and\nconstruction began on facilities to develop and test aircraft piston\nengines and their components, study fuels and combustion, and\nperform research in fundamental physics, chemistry, and metallurgy of power plants. In 1943 research would belatedly begin on jet\nAmes Research Center, 19 70.

After Dr. Lewis\'s death in 1948, the new facility was named\nthe Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory. Wartime expansion came to\nLangley too; the War Department bought more acreage and NACA\nexpanded into a west area with additional facilities that doubled the\nresearch capabili ty.\nWorld War II dramatically changed NACA-and aviation. For\nNACA it meant a shift in both the nature and the size of its workload. For aviation it meant a surge in speed and altitude of combat\naircraft. NACA turned its attention to the short-term urgencies of\nfinding practical fixes for problems in military aircraft already in\nproduction or on the drawing boards. The rapid increase in\nperformance and the punishing demands of combat flying had also\ngenerated or exaggerated a host of aerodynamic and structural\nproblems. The workload was overwhelmi ng. From 1941 through\n1944 the NACA laboratories worked on 115 different airplane types.\nBut results were quietly spectacular; fighter aircraft speeds and\naltitudes were increased, buffeting and stalls were cured, the tail\ndesign of the B-29 was saved from a dangerous weakness.

The laboratory is on the near side of the Cleveland\nAirport.\n\n8\n\nORD ERS OF MA GN ITU D E\n\nnumber of NACA personnel rose 13-fold from the 1939 figure, to\n6800, and cadres from the Langley mother laboratory served as the\nadministrative and research cores at the two new laboratories.\nIn the midst of expanding from one to three laboratories,\nNACA\'s work was effective. "The Navy\'s famous fighters-the\nCorsair, Wildcat, and Hellcat- are possible only because they were\nbased on fundamentals developed by the NACA," Secretary of the\nNavy Frank Knox volunteered in 1943. "All of them use NACA wing\nsections, NACA cooling methods, NACA high-lift devices. The great\nsea victories that have broken Japan \'s expanding grip in the Pacific\nwould not have been possible without the contributions of the\nNACA."\nNEW HORIZONS\n\nTo the scientific community, the most exciting legacy of World\nWar II was a glittering array of new technologies spawned by the\nmassive war effort. Atomic energy, radar, antibiotics, the large\nrocket, radio telemetry, the computer, and the jet engine were war\nbabies, lustily crying for expanded roles in the postwar world. The\natomic age, the jet age, and the space age were at hand. They would\nshape the world\'s destiny in the next three decades and heavily\ninfluence the rest of the century.\nThe world\'s political order had been drastically altered by the\nwar. Much of Europe and Asia was in ashes. Old empires had\ncrumbled; national economies were tottering perilously. Astride\nopposite sides of the world, towering like colossi, stood the United\nStates and the Soviet Union, newly made into superpowers. It soon\nbecame apparent that they would test each other\'s mettle many times\nbefore a balance of power stabilized. And each nation moved quickly\nto exploit the new technologies.\nThe atomic bomb was the most obvious and most immediately\nthreatening technological change from World War II. Both superpowers sought the best strategic systems that could deliver the bomb\nacross the intercontinental dista.n:ces that separated them. J etpowered bombers were an obvious extension of the wartime B-17\nand B-29, and both nations began designing and building them. The\nintercontinental rocket held great theoretical promise, but seemed\nmuch further down the technological road. Atomic bombs were\nbulky and heavy; a rocket to lift such a payload would be enormous\nin size and expense. The Soviet Union doggedly went ahead with\nattempts to build such rockets. The American military temporarily\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nL_\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA A\n\n0\n\nASA, 191 5- 1980\n\n9\n\nsettled upon jet aircraft and smaller research and battlefield rockets.\nThe Army imported Wernher von Braun and the German engineers\nwho had created the wartime V-I and V-2 rockets and set them to\noverseeing the refurbishing and launching ofV-2s at White Sands,\nNew Mexico. With its contractor theJet Propulsion Laboratory, the\nArmy developed a series of battlefield missiles known as Corporal,\nSergeant, and Redstone. The Navy designed and built the Viking\nresearch rockets. The freshly independent Air Force started a family\nof cruise missiles, from the jet Bomarc and Matador battlefield missiles to Snark and the ambitious rocket-propelled Navaho, which\nwere intended as intercontinental weapons .\nBy 1951 progress on a thermonuclear bomb revived interest in\nthe long-range ballistic missile. Two months before President\nTruman announced that the United States would develop the thermonuclear bomb, the Air Force contracted with Consolidated\nVultee Aircraft Corporation (later Convair) to resume study, and\nthen to develop, the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile, a project\nthat had been dormant for four years. During the next four years\nthree intermediate range missiles, the Army\'s Jupiter, the Navy\'s\nPolaris , and the Air Force\'s Thor, and asecond generation ICBM, the\nAir Force\'s Titan, had been added to the list of American rocket\nprojects. All were accorded top national priority. Fiscal 1953 saw the\nDepartment of Defense for the first time spend more than $1 million\non missile research, development, and procurement. Fiscal 1957 saw\nthe amount go over the $1 billion mark.\nThe new postwar technologies were also having a dramatic\neffect on NACA. The swift rise of aircraft speeds and altitudes during\nthe war had consumed the technological data base that NACA had so\nlaboriously created in the 1930s. And now the jet engine, still in its\ninfancy, portended another big surge in aircraft speed. Ahead lay the\nmysteries of the sound barrier, where strange things happened to\nfighter planes. Planes had crashed, men had died; by 1945 the need\nfor information was urgent. In that year study began on a series of\nnew wind tunnels; after many ups and downs the Unitary Plan was\npassed by Congress in 1949. It allotted $75 million to NACA for new\nwind tunnels and started a wind-tunnel center (Arnold Engineering\nDevelopment Center) for the Air Force.\nBut aerodynamic research faced serious physical obstacles. The\nwind tunnel, NACA\'s principal tool for aerodynamic research,\nyielded accurate data for subsonic and supersonic speeds but at\ntransonic speeds (mach 0.9 to 1.1 ) suffered a "choking" effect that\ngarbled the data. Until this problem was remedied-if it could be\n\n10\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nremedied-other means had to be devised. In 1943 NACA took\nsteps to meet the challenge.\nThe short-term effort involved carrying test models to high\naltitudes in aircraft and dropping them, gathering flight data during\ntheir ballistic fall. This was only partially successful, since radar and\ntelemetry were too primitive to return sophisticated data. Also, the\nobjects seldom exceeded mach 1. The next step in this direction was\nto use rockets as motive power to launch models to transonic and\nsupersonic speeds. Langley acquired a surplus naval station on\nWallops Island, Virginia, for this purpose. It was called the Pilotless\nAircraft Research Division. Later it became the Wallops Flight\nCenter.\nThe long-term measure was to plan and operate, in concert with\nthe Air Corps and the Navy, the first of what was to become a highly\nsuccessful series of special research aircraft. NACA\'s High-Speed\nFlight Research Station was established at Edwards, California, on\nMuroc Dry Lake. On 14 October 1947, Air Force Capt. Charles E.\nYeager flew the X-I aircraft faster than the speed of sound. The\ndreaded barrier was breached. On 20 November 1953, NACA\'s\nScott Crossfield in the 0-558-2 reached mach 2. The X-IA, the X-2,\nthe X-15-faster and higher they flew , peaking at mach 6 (7272\n"Little missile row" at Wallops Flight Center, Virginia.

Over a\nspan of 22 years and more than 700 flights, the specially built\nresearch aircraft perilously, meticulously filled in the flight envelope\nfor tran onic and supersonic flight and provided the design data for\ngenerations of post-World War II military aircraft.\nMeanwhile researchers at Langley had worked away at the\nintransigent transonic wind tunnel and by late 1950 John Stack and\nhis team had come up with the answer-the "slotted throat," which\neliminated the choking at dr near the speed of sound and made the\ntransonic tunnel an effective research tool. Within a year it had\nproved its worth; Richard Whitcomb discovered the "area rule," a\nsubtle balancing of the volume of fuselage and wings which produced the minimum-drag aircraft at transonic speeds. Quickly\napplied to military fighters already in design and construction, it\nenabled them to be the first fighters to break the sound barrier in\nlevel flight.\nBy the mid-1950s NACA had modern research facilities that\nhad cost a total of $300 million, a staff totaling 7200. With each\npassing year it was enlarging its missile research in proportion to the\nold mission of aerodynamic research. Major NACA contributions to\nthe military missile programs came in 1955-1957. Materials research\nled by Robert R. Cilruth at Langley confirmed ablation as a means of\ncontrolling the intense heat generated by warheads and other bodies\nreentering the earth\'s atmosphere; H. Julian Allen at Ames demonstrated the blunt-body shape as the most effective design for reen-\n\nA HI STORY OF NACA A 0\n\nASA, 191 5- 1980\n\n13\n\ntering bodies; and Alfred J. Eggers at Ames did significant work on\nthe m chanics of balli tic reentry.\nThe mid-1950s saw America\'s infant space program burgeoning with promise and projects. As part of the U.S. participation in the\nforthcoming International Ceophy ical Year, it was proposed to\nlaunch a small satellite into orbit around the earth. After a spirited\ndesign competition between the National Academy of Sciencesavy proposal (Vanguard) and the Army-Jet Propulsion Laboratory candidate (Explorer), the Navy design was chosen in September\n1955 as not interfering with the high-priority military missile\nprograms , since it would use a new booster based on the Viking\nresearch rocket, and having a better tracking system and more scientific growth potential. By 1957 Vanguard was readying its first test\nvehicles for firing. The USSR had also announced it would have an\nICY satellite; the space race was extending beyond boosters to\npayloads.\nOn the military front, space activity was almost bewildering.\nThe missiles were moving toward the critical flight-test phase. Satellite ideas were proliferating, though mostly on a ub-rosa planning\nbasi ; after Sputnik these would become Tiros , weather satellite ;\nTransit, navigation satellite; Samos, reconnaissance satellite; Midas,\nmissile early-warning satellite; Pioneer lunar probes ; Discoverer\nre earch satellites. Payload size and weight were constant problems\nin all these concepts, with the limited thrust of the early rocket\nengines. Here the rapid advances in solid-state electronics came to\nthe rescue by reducing volume and weight; with new techniques such\nas printed circuitry and transistors, the design engineers could\xc2\xb7\nachieve new levels of miniaturization of equipment. Even so, heavier\npayloads were obviously in the offing; more powerful engines had to\nbe developed. So design was begun for several larger engines, topped\nby the monster F-1 engine, intended to produce 4450 kilonewtons of\nthrust-eight times the power of the engines that lifted the Atlas,\nThor, and Jupiter missiles .\nAll this activity, however, was still on the drawing board, work\nbench , or test stand on 4 October 1957, when the " beep, beep"\nsignal from Sputnik 1 was heard around the world. The Soviet Union\nhad orbited the world \'s first artificial satellite.\nTh e American publi c\'s res pon e was swift and wides pread. It\nseemed equally compounded of alarm and chagrin. Our complacent certainty that this nation was always number one in technology\nhad been rudely shattered. Not only had the Russ ians been first-\n\n14\n\nORDERS OF MAGNIT DE\n\nalthough that was bad enough-but Sputnik weighed an impressive\n83 kilograms against Vanguard\'s intended start at 1A kilograms and\nworking up to 10 kilograms in later satellites. In a cold war environment, the contrast suggested undefined but ominous military\nimplications.\nFuel for such apprehensions added up rapidly. Less than a\nmonth after Sputnik 1 the Russians launched Sputnik 2, weighing a\nhefty 500 kilograms and carrying a dog as passenger. President\nEisenhower, trying to dampen the growing concern, assured the\npublic of our as-yet-undemonstrated progress and denied there was\nany military threat in the Soviet space achievements. As a counter the\nWhite Hou e announced the impending launch in December of the\nfirst Vanguard test vehicle capable of OTbit and belatedly authorized\nvon Braun\'s Army research team in Huntsville to try to launch their\nExplorer-Jupiter comb ination. But pressures for dramatic action\ngathered rapidly. The media ballyhooed the carefully qualified\nannouncement on Vanguard into great expectations of America\'s\nvindication. On 25 November Lyndon B.Johnson, Senate majority\nleader, chaired the first meeting of the Preparedness Investigation\nSubcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The hearings wou ld review the whole spectrum of American defense and\nspace programs.\nStill the toboggan careened downhill. On 6 December 1957, the\nmuch-touted Vanguard test veh icle rose one meter from the launch\nplatform, shuddered, and collapsed in flames. Its tiny lA-kilogram\npayload broke away and lay at the edge of the inferno, beeping\nimpotently.\nClouds of gloom deepened into the new year. Then, finally, a\nsmall rift. On 31 January 1958, an American satelli te at last went into\norbit. Not Vanguard but the ABMA-JPL Explorer had redeemed\nAmerican honor. True, the payload weighed only 14 kilograms\nagainst the 500 of Sputnik 2. But there was a scientific first; an\nexperiment aboard the satellite reported mysterious saturation of its\nradiation counters at 965 kilometers altitude. Prof. J ames A. Van\nAllen, the scientist who had built the experiment, thought this\nsuggested the existence of a dense belt of radiation around the earth\nat that altitude. And American confidence perked up on 17 March\nwhen Vanguard 1 joined Explorer 1 in orbit.\nMeanwhile, in these same tense months, both consensus and\ncompetition had been forming on the political front: consensus that\na national augmented space program was essential; competition as to\n\n, ------\n\nA ball offire and flying debris mark the explosivefailure ofthe first A merican attempt to\nlaunch a satellite on Vanguard, 6 December 1957.\n\nwho would run such a program, in what form, with what priorities.\nThe Department of Defense, with its component military services,\nwas an obvious front runner. The Atomic Energy Commission,\nalready working with nuclear warheads and nuclear propulsion, had\nsome congressional support, particularly in theJoint Committee on\nAtomic Energy. And there was NACA.\nNACA had devoted more and more of its facilities, budget, and\nexpertise to missile research in the mid and late 1950s.

Doolittle, chairman, and Hugh L.\nDryden, director, the strong NACA research team had come up with\na solid, long-term, scientifically based proposal for a blend of aeronautic and space research. Its concept for manned spaceflight, for\n\n___ J\n\nI~-\n\nA HISTORY Of\n\nACA A\n\n0\n\nA A , 191 5- 1980\n\n17\n\nexample, envisioned a ballistic-shaped spacecraft with a blunt\nreentry shape, backed by a world-encircling tracking system, and\nequ ipped with dual a utomatic and manual controls that would\nenable the astronaut gradually to take over more and more of the\nflying of his spacecraft. Also NACA offered reassuring experience of\nlong, close working relationships with the military services in so lving their research problems, while at the same time translating the\nresearch into civi l applications. But NACA\'s greatest political asset\nwas its peaceful, research-oriented image. President Eisenhower and\nSenator Johnson and others in Congress were united in wanting\nabove all to avoid projecting cold-war tensions into the new arena of\nouter space.\nBy March 1958 the consensus in Washington had jelled. The\nadministration position-largely credited to James R. Killian in the\nnew post of president\'S special assistant for science and technologythe findings of J ohnson\'s Senate subcommittee, and the NACA\nproposal converged. America needed a national space program . The\nmilitary component would of course be under DoD. But a civil\ncomponent, lodged in a new agency, techno logically and scientifically based, would pick up certain of the existing space projects\nand forge an expanded program of space exploration in close\nconcert with the military. All these concepts fed into draft legislation.\nOn 2 April 1958, the administration bill for establishing a national\naeronautics and space agency was submitted to Congress; both\nhouses had already established select space committees; debate\nensued; a number of refinements were introduced; and on 29 July\n1958 President Eisenhower signed into law P.L. 85-568, the National\nAeronautics and Space Act of 1958.\nThe act established a broad charter for civilian aeronautical and\nspace research, with unique requirements for dissemination of\ninformation; absorbed the existing NACA into the new organization\nas its nucleus; and empowered broad transfers from other government programs. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration came into being on 1 October 1958 .\nAll this made for a very busy spring and summer for the people\nin the small NACA Headquarters in Washington. Once the general\noutlines of the new organization were clear, both a space program\nand a new organization had to be charted. In April Dryden brought\nAbe Silverstein, assistant director of Lewis Laboratory, to Washington to head the program planning. Ira Abbott, NACA assistant\ndirector for aerodynamic research, headed a committee to plan the\n\nNA SA\'s first high command. Hugh L.

In August President Eisenhower nominated\nT. Keith Glennan, president of Case Institute of Technology and\nformer commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission, to be the\nfirst administrator of the new organization, NASA, and Dryden to be\ndeputy administrator. QuickJy confirmed by the Senate, they were\nsworn in on 19 August. Glennan reviewed the planning efforts,\napproved most. Talks with the Advanced Research Projects Agency\nidentified the military space programs that were space-science\noriented and obvious transfers to the new agency. Plans were formulated for building a new center for space science research, satellite\ndevelopment, flight operations, and tracking. A site was chosen, two\nsquare kilometers ofthe Department of Agriculture\'s research center\nin Beltsville, Maryland. In March 1961 the Robert H. Goddard Space\nFlight Center (named for America\'s rocket pioneer) was dedicated .\n\n2\nThe New Space Program\nOn 1 October 1958, the 170 people in Headquarters gathered in\nthe courtyard of their building, the Dolley Madison House, to hear\nClennan proclaim the end of the 43-year-old NACA and the\nbeginning of NASA. The 8000 people, three laboratories (now\nrenamed research centers) and two stations, with a total facilities\nvalue of $300 million, and the annual budget of $100 million were\ntransferred intact to NASA. On the same day, by executive order the\npresident transferred to NASA Project Vanguard, its ISO-person\nstaff, and remaining budget from the Naval Research Laboratory;\nlunar probes from the Army; lunar probes and rocket engine\nprograms, including the F-I, from the Air Force; and a total of over\n$100 million of unexpended funds. NASA immediately delegated\noperational control of these projects back to the DoD agencies while\nit put its own house in order.\nThere followed an intense two-year period of organization,\nbuild-up, fill-in, planning, and general catch-up. Only one week\nafter NASA was formed, Clennan gave the go-ahead to Project\nMercury, America\'s first manned spaceflight program. The Space\nTask Croup, headed by Robert R. Cilruth, was established at Langley\nto get the job done. The new programs brought into the organization\nwere slowly integrated into the NACA nucleus. Many space-minded\nspecialists were drawn into NASA, attracted by the exciting new\nvistas. Long-range planning was accelerated; the first NASA 10-year\nplan was presented to Congress in February 1960. It called for an\nexpanding program on a broad front: manned flight, first orbital,\nthen circumlunar; scientific satellites to measure radiation and\nother features of the near-space environment; lunar probes to\nmeasure the lunar space environment and to photograph the moon;\nplanetary probes to measure and to photograph Mars and Venus;\nweather satellites to improve our knowledge of Earth\'s broad\nweather patterns; continued aeronautical research; and development oflarger launch vehicles for lifting heavier payloads. Cost of the\n20\n\nA HISTORY OF\n\nACA A D\n\nA A, 19 15- 1980\n\n21\n\nprogram was expected to vary between $1 billion and $1.5 billion a\nyear over the 10-year period.\nTo conduct such a program, NASA obviously needed capabilities it did not have. To that end Glennan sought to acquire the\nsuccessful Army team that had launched America\'s first satellite, the\nArmy Ballistic Missile Agency at Huntsville, Alabama, and its\ncontractor, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nThe Army balked at losing the Huntsville group, claiming it was\nindispensable to the Army\'s military rocket program. Glennan for\nthe time being had to compromise: ABMA would work on NASA\nprograms as requested. The Army grudgingly gave up jPL. On 3\nDecember 1958, an executive order transferred, effective 31 December, the government-owned plant ofjPL and the Army contract with\nthe California Institute of Technology, under whichjPL was staffed\nand operated. Glennan renewed his bid for ABMA in 1959;\nprotracted Army resistance was finally overcome and on 15 March\n1960 ABMA\'s 4000-man Development Operations Division, headed\n\nj et Propulsion Laboratory, 1963.

NASA was going to be markedly\ndifferent from NACA in two important ways . First, it was going to be\noperational as well as do research. So, it would not only design and\nbuild launch vehicles and satellite but it would launch them,\noperate them, track them , acquire data from them, and interpret the\ndata. Second, it would do the greater part of its work by contract\n\nA HISTORY OF NA CA A 0 NASA, 19 15- 198 0\n\nI\n\\\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\\\n\nI\nI\n\n23\n\nrather than in house as NACA had done. The first of these required\ntracking sites in many countries around the world, as well as\nconstruction of facilities: antennas, telemetry equipment, computers, radio and landline communications networks, etc. The second\nrequired the development of a larger and more sophisticated\ncontracting operation than NACA had needed. In the first years,\nNASA leaned heavily on DoD for contracting assistance. Since its\nindustrial contractors would be the same aerospace firms who were\nalready doing extensive business with DoD, this was practical and\nworkable, especially since NASA adopted most of the DoD procurement system.\nThe problem of launch vehicles occupied much attention in\nthese first years. A family of existing and future launch vehicles had\nto be structured for the kinds of missions and spacecraft enumerated\nin the plan. In addition to the existing Redstone, Thor, and Atlas\nvehicles, NASA would develop:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nScout, a low-budget solid-propellant booster that could put\nsmall payloads in orbit;\nCentaur, a liquid-hydrogen-fueled upper stage, transferred\nfrom DoD, that promised higher thrust and bigger payloads\nfor lunar and planetary missions;\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nThe worldwide satellite tracking network, 19 74.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nl\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nLegend:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network\n[STDN] Facilities\n..

By December 1959 the United States had attempted 3 7\nsatellite launches; less than one-third attained orbit. Electrical\ncomponents, valves, turbopumps, welds, materials, structuresvirtually everything that went into the intricate mechanism called a\nbooster- had to be redesigned or strengthened or improved to\nwithstand the stresses of launch. A new order of perfection in\nmanufacturing and assembly had to be instilled in workmen and\nmanagers. Rigorous, repeated testing had to verify each component,\nthen subassembly, then total vehicle. That bugaboo of the engineering profession, constant fiddling and changing in search of perfection, had to be constrained in the interest of reliability. And since the\nexisting vehicles were DoD products, NASA had to persuade DoD to\nenforce these rigorous standards on its contractors.\nThat was only one of the areas in which close coordination\nbetween NASA and DoD was essential and effective. In manned\nspaceflight, for example, there were essentially four approaches to\nputting man into space:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 the research airplane-the Air Force and NASA were already\nwell into this program, leading to the X-15;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 the ballistic vehicle-NASA\'s Project Mercury embodied\nthis approach, with Air Force launch vehicles and DoD\nsupport throughout;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 the boost-glider-the Air Force had inaugurated the DynaSoar project (later renamed the X-20) in November 1957. A\nmanned glider would be boosted into shallow Earth orbit,\nbounce in and out of the top of the atmosphere for part or all\nof a revolution of the planet, and land like an airplane. In\nMay 1958 NACA had agreed to help with the technical side\nof the project. NASA continued that support;\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nJ\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nA HI STORY OF NAC A A 0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nASA, 19 15- 1980\n\n25\n\nthe lifting body-a bathtub-like shape proposed by Alfred J.\nEggers of Ames Laboratory; as a reentry shape it would be\nmidway between an airplane configuration and the ballistic\nshape, developing moderate lift during reentry and landing\nlike an airplane. This approach would be deferred for a few\nyears before being explored by the Air Force and NASA.\n\nIn another area, communications satellites, DoD had its\nCourier program, a low-altitude, militarily secure communications\nsatellite; it also had Advent, intended to be put into equatorial\nsynchronous orbit by the Atlas-Centaur booster and provide global\ncommunications for the military. NASA had a passive communications satellite, Echo, a 30-meter inflatable sphere from which to\nbounce radar signals as a limited communications relay and, over a\nperiod of time and with accurate tracking, to plot the variations in air\ndensity at the top of the atmosphere by following the vagaries of its\norbit. It had been agreed that NASA would leave active communications satellites (those that picked up, amplified, and rebroadcast\nradio signals from one point on Earth to another) to DoD. But this\ndid not answer for long. By 1960 the American Telephone and\nTelegraph Company was asking NASA to launch its low-level, active\ncommunications satellite, Telstar. NASA also had another proposal\nfor medium-altitude (roughly 17 900-kilometer orbit) communications satellites.\nThe AT&T proposal raised a fundamental problem: would\nindustry develop communications satellites entirely with its own\nmoney or would the government fund such research? NASA sought\nand received presidential approval to go both ways-to provide\nreimbursable launches to industry and to do its own communications satellite research. First there was Relay, the medium-altitude\nrepeater satellite. Beyond lay the imaginative proposal from Hughes\nAircraft Company for Syncom, a synchronous-orbit satellite-one\nthat would fly at 35 OOO-kilometer altitude, where distance, gravity,\nand velocity combined to place a satellite permanently over the same\nspot on Earth ; by virtue of the lofty orbit, three of these satellites\ncould cover the entire planet and require only a handful of ground\nstations.\nBy the time of the presidential election of 1960 the worst pangs\nof reorganization, redefinition, and planning were over. Programs\nwere meshing with each other; contracting for large projects was\nbecoming routine; the initial absorption of DoD programs had been\ncompleted; and a viable organization was in business.\n\n26\n\nORDERS OF MAG !TUDE\n\n!here were operational bright spots as well. True, launch\nvehicles were still fickle and unpredictable-7 out of 17 launches\nfailed in 1959. But finally in August 1959, NASA launched its first\nsatellite that functioned in all respects (Explorer 6). Pioneer 5, launched\non 11 March 1960 and intended to explore interplanetary space\nbetween Earth and Venus, communicated out to a new distance\nrecord, 35.7 million kilometers. The first of the prototype weather\nsatellites, Tiros 1, launched on 1 April 1960, produced 22500 photos\nof Earth\'s weather. Echo 1, the first passive communications satellite,\nwas launched 12 August 1960, inflated in orbit, and provided a\npassive target for bouncing long-range communications from one\npoint on Earth to another. Perhaps as important, millions of people\nsaw the moving pinpoint of light in the night sky and were awed by\nthe experience.\nIn late 1960 politics bemused the space program. Although not\na direct campaign issue in the presidential campaign, the space\nprogram found little reassurance of its priority as an expensive new\nitem in the federal budget. After John F. Kennedy was narrowly\nAn early Tiros photo of the Great Lakes area on a wintry day.\n\nA HISTORY OF\n\nACA AND\n\nASA , 191 5- 1980\n\n27\n\nelected, the uncertainty deepened. Jerome B. Wiesner, the presidentelect\'s science adviser, chaired a committee which produced a report\nboth critical of the space program\'s progress to date and skeptical of\nits future. Who would be the new administrator? What, if any,\npriority would the fledgling space program have in a new, on-recordhostile administration?\nThen, once again, challenge and response. On 12 April 1961,\nSoviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin rode Vostok 1 into a 30 1-by-17 4kilometer orbit of the earth. After one orbit he reentered the\natmosphere and landed safely. Man had flown in space. Gagarin\njoined that elite pantheon of men who were the first to do the\nundoable-the Wright brothers, Lindbergh, now Gagarin. There\nwas faint consolation on 5 May 1961, when Mercury essayed its first\nmanned spaceflight. Astronaut Alan B. Shepard,jr., rodea Redstone\nbooster in his Freedom 7 Mercury spacecraft for a I5-minute\nsuborbital flight and was picked out of the water 487 kilometers\ndownrange. Success, yes; a good beginning, yes. But Gagarin had\nflown around the earth, 40 000 kilometers against Shepard\'s 487. His\nVostok weighed 4730 kilograms in orbit, contrasting with Mercury\'s\n953 kilograms in suborbit. Gagarin had had about 89 minutes in\nweighdessness, the mysterious zero-gravity condition that had\nsupplanted the sound barrier as the great unknown. Shepard\nexperienced 5 minutes of weighdessness. By any unit of measurement, the United States was clearly still behind, especially in the\nindispensable prerequisite of rocket power. As the new president\nhad said, gloomily: "We are behind .... the news will be worse before\nit is better, and it will be some time before we catch up."\nThe public reaction was less emphatic than after Sputnik 1 but\ncongressional concern was strong. Robert C . Seamans,jr., NASA\'s\nassociate administrator and general manager, was hard put to\nrestrain Congress from forcing more money on NASA than could be\neffectively used.\nPresident Kennedy was especially concerned. His inaugural\naddress in January had rung with an eloquent promise of bold new\ninitiatives that would "get this country moving again." The succeeding three months had been distinguished by crushing setbacksthe Bay of Pigs invasion fiasco and the Gagarin flight. As one of\nseveral searches for new initiatives, the president asked his vice\npresident, Lyndon B. Johnson, to head a study of what would be\nrequired in the space program to convincingly surpass the Soviets .\njohnson, the only senior White House figure in the new administra-\n\n28\n\nORD E RS OF MAGN ITU DE\n\ntion with prior commitment to the space program, found strong\nsupport waiting in the wings. James E. Webb, new administrator of\nNASA, had an established reputation as an aggressive manager of\nlarge enterprises, both in industry and in the Truman administration as director of the Bureau of the Budget and undersecretary of\nstate. Backed by the seasoned technical judgment of Dryden, his\ndeputy, and Seamans, his general manager, Webb moved vigorously\nto accelerate and expand the central elements of the NASA lO-year\nplan.\nThe largest single concept in that plan had been manned circumlunar flight. Now the question became: could this country rally\nquickly enough to beat the Soviets to that circumlunar goal? The\nconsidered technical estimate was: not for sure. But if we went one\nlarge step further and escalated the commitment to manned lunar\nlanding and return, it became a new ball game. Both nations would\nhave to design and construct a whole new family of boosters and\nspacecraft; this would be an equalizer in terms of challenge to both\nnations and the experts were confident that the depth and competence of the American government-industry-university team would\nprove superior. In this judgment they found a strong ally in the new\nsecretary of defense, Robert S. McNamara.\nBut Webb and his advisers were not content with a one-shot\nobjective. The goal, they said, was a major space advance on a broad\nfront-manned spaceflight, yes, but also boosters, communications\nsatellites, meteorological satellites, scientific satellites, planetary\nexploration.\nThis was the combined proposal presented to the vice president\nand approved and transmitted by him to the president. It was the\nbest new initiative the president had seen. So it was that on 25 May\n1961 the president stood before a joint session of Congress and\nproposed a historic national goal:\nNow it is time co rake lo nger stride - time fo r a great new Am eri can\nenterprise-time fo r thi s nati on to rake a clearly leading role in space\nachievem ent, which in many ways may ho ld th e key to o ur future o n earth . . .\n. . .

Editorial\nsupport was widespread. Congressional debate was perfunctory,\n\nPresidentJohnF.

The decision\nmoon was endorsed virtually without dissent.\n\nto\n\nland a man on the\n\nTHE LUNAR COMMITMENT\n\nNASA was exhilarated but awed. Dryden had returned from a\nWhite House m eeting to tell his staff that " this man" (Web b) had sold\nthe president on landing a man on the moon. Cilruth, immersed in\nwhat seemed to be big enough problems in the relatively modest\nProject Mercury, was temporarily aghast. But the die was cast. The\nnation had accepted the challenge to its largest technological\nenterprise, dwarfing even the wartime Manhattan Proj ect for developing the atomic bomb and the postwar crash develo pment of\nstrategic missiles.\nThe blank check was there; the way to use it was far from clear.\nSince 1958, studies had been under way on a circumlunar manned\nflight. Since 1959, George M. Low, head of the manned spaceflight\noffice in Headquarters, had ramrodded a series of progressively\nmore detailed studies on the requirements for a manned landing on\n\n30\n\nORDERS OF M A GNITUDE\n\nthe moon. Those studies had established a broad confidence that no\nmajor technological or scientific breakthroughs were needed to get a\nman to the moon or even to land and return him. But there were\nsome operational unknowns; the blank check caused them suddenly\nto loom larger. The assumption had been that one simply built a big\nenough booster, flew directly to the moon, landed a large vehicle,\nand returned some part of it directly to Earth. But there were wide\nscientific disagreements as to the nature of the lunar surface. Was it\nsolid "ground," strong enough to support such a load? Or was it\nmany feet of dust, in which a spacecraft would disappear without a\ntrace? Or was it something in between? There were operational\nproblems too: could the crew and ground control possibly handle\nthe enormous peak of work that would bunch together in the landing\nphase of a direct-ascent mission? The alternative seemed to be that\none boosted pieces of a lunar vehicle into Earth orbit, assembled and\nrefueled them there, and took off for a direct landing on the moon.\nThis too was fraught with hazards: could payloads rendezvous in\nEarth orbit? Could men assemble complex equipment in the\ndemanding environment of space? Could such operations as refueling with volatile fuels-hazardous enough on Earth-be safely\nperformed in space?\nSome points were clear. The very massiveness of the effort\nwould make this program different in kind from anything NASA had\nattempted. New organizational modes were essential; no one center\ncould handle this program. A much stronger Headquarters team\nwould be needed, coordinating the effous of several centers and\nriding herd on an enormous mobilization of American industry and\nuniversity effort.\nAlso, there were long-lead-time problems that needed to be\nworked on irrespective of later decisions. One of these was three\nyears under way-a big engine. Work on the 4400-kilonewton-thrust\nF-l engine would be accelerated. Another was a navigation system;\naccurate vectoring of a spacecraft from Earth to a precise point on a\nrapidly moving moon 370000 kilometers away was a formidable\nproblem in celestial mechanics. Therefore the first large Apollo\ncontract was let to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its\nInstrumentation Laboratory, headed by C. Stark Draper, to begin\nstudy of this inscrutable problem and to develop the requisite\nnavigational system.\nThe basic spacecraft could be delineated-the one in which a\ncrew would depart the earth, travel to the moon, and return. It\n\n-\n\n~\n\n-\n\n-\n\n~\n\n--~~~\n\n--\n\n-----~~\n\n---~-~----~\n\nA HISTORY OF\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\\\n\n!\n(\n\nI\n\nI\n\nACA AND\n\nASA , 19 15- 1980\n\n31\n\nshould have a baggage car, a jettisonable service module housing the\npropulsion, expendable oxygen, etc. The Space Task Group was\nhard at work on these with its left hand, while its main effort on\nMercury went forward. That left hand had to be strengthened.\nA whole new logistics system was needed; from factory to\nlaunch, everything had outstripped normal sizes and normal transportation. There would have to be new factories, mammoth test\nstands, huge launch complexes. Railroads and highways could not\nhandle the larger components. Ship transportation seemed the only\nanswer. A massive facility design and site location program had to\nbegin even before the final configuration of the vehicle was decided.\nLimited in the facilities and construction area, NASA decided to call\non the tested resources of the Army Corps of Engineers. It proved to\nbe one of the wiser decisions in this hectic period.\nAs planning went forward in 1961 and 1962, order gradually\nemerged. A new concept for how to get to the moon painfully\nsurfaced: lunar-orbit rendezvous. A small group at Langley, headed\nby John C. Houbolt, had studied the trade-offs of direct ascent,\nEarth-orbit rendezvous, and other possibilities. They had been\nincreasingly struck with the vehicle and fuel economics of this\nmission profile: after stabilizing in Earth orbit, a set of spacecraft\nwent to orbit around the moon, and, leaving the mother spacecraft in\nlunar orbit, dispatched a smaller craft to land on the lunar surface,\nreconnoiter, and rejoin the mother craft in lunar orbit for the return\nto Earth. Over a period of two years they refined their complex\nmathematics and argued their case. As time b~came critical for\ndefinition of the launch vehicle, they argued their case before one\nNASA audience after another. Finally Houbolt, in a bold move, went\noutside of "channels" and got the personal attention of Seamans.\nThis was a decision of such importance to the total program that\nimposed decision was not enough; the major elements of NASA had\nto be won over and concur in the final technical judgment.\nDismissed at first as risky and very literally " far out," lunar orbit\nrendezvous gradually won adherents. In July 1962 D. Brainerd\nHolmes, NASA director of manned spaceflight, briefed the House\nspace committee on lunar orbit rendezvous, the chosen method of\ngoing to the moon.\nOnce made, this decision permitted rapid definition of the\nApollo spacecraft combination. Launch vehicle configuration had\nbeen arrived at seven months earlier. The objective would be to put a\npayload of nearly 136000 kilograms in Earth orbit and 45000\n\n32\n\nORDERS OF MAG\n\nIT U DE\n\nkilograms in orbit around the moon. To do this required a threestage vehicle, the first stage employing the F-l engine in a cluster of\nfive, to provide 33000 kilonewtons of thrust at launch. The second\nstage would cluster five of a new 890-kilonewton-thrust liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen engine (the J-2). The third stage,\npowered by a singleJ-2 engine, would boost the Apollo three-man\nspacecraft out of Earth orbit and into the lunar gravitational field. At\nthat point the residual three-spacecraft combination would take\nover: a command module housing the astronauts, a service module\nproviding propulsion for maneuvers, and a two-man lunar module\nfor landing on the moon. The engine on the service module would\nignite to slow the spacecraft enough to be captured into lunar orbit;\nthe fragile lunar mod ule would leave the mother craft and descend to\nland its two passengers on the moon. After lunar reconnaissance, the\nastronauts would blast off in the top half of the lunar module to\nrejoin the mother craft in lunar orbit, and the service module would\nfire up for return to Earth.\nA smaller launch vehicle, which would later be dubbed the\nSaturn IB, would be built first and used to test the Apollo spacecraft\nin Earth orbit. Even this partial fulfillment of the Apollo mission\nwould require a first stage of 7300 kilonewtons of thrust and a highenergy liquid oxygen-liquid hydrogen second stage.\nThe grand design was now complete. But in the articulating of it,\nvast gaps in experience and technology were revealed. At three\ncritical points the master plan depended on successful rendezvous\nand docking of spacecraft. Although theoretically feasible, it had\nnever been done and was not within the scope of Project Mercury.\nHow could practical experience be gained with rendezvous and\ndocking short of an intricate, hideously expensive, and possibly\ndisastrous series of experiments with Apollo hardware? Men would,\nhopefully, land and walk upon the moon. But could men and their\nequipment function in space outside the artificial and confining\nenvironment of their spacecraft? Other systems and other questions\ncould be engineered to solution on Earth, but the ultimate questions\nhere could only be answered in space. We had bitten off more than\nwe could chew. Clearly somethingwas needed between the first steps\nof Mercury and the grand design of Apollo. The gap was too great to\njump when men\'s lives were at stake.\nEven Mercury sometimes seemed a very big mouthful to chew.\nBut slowly, stubborn problem after stubborn problem yielded. The\nsecond suborbital flight, Liberty Bell 7, was launched on 21 July 1961;\nits 16-minute flight went well, though on landing the hatch blew off\n\nAstronautJohn H.

In September\nthe unmanned Mercury-Atlas combination was orbited successfully\nand landed where it was supposed to, east of Bermuda. On 29\nNovember the final test flight took chimpanzee Enos on a two-orbit\nride and landed him in good health. The system was qualified for\nmanned orbital flight. And on 20 February 1962, AstronautJohn H.\n\n34\n\nORDERS OF MAG\n\nITUDE\n\nGlenn, Jr., became the first American to orbit the earth in space.\nFriendship 7 circled the earth three times; Glenn flew parts of the last\ntwo orbits manually because of trouble with his autopilot.\nThe United States took its astronaut heroes to its heart with an\nenthusiasm that bewildered them and startled NASA. Their mail was\nenormous; hundreds of requests for personal appearances poured\nin. Glenn had a rainy parade in Washington and addressed a joint\nsession of Congress. On 1 March four million people in New York\nshowered confetti and ticker tape on him and fellow astronauts\nShepard and Grissom. Nor was the event unnoticed by the competition. President Kennedy announced the day after the Glenn flight\nthat Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev had congratulated the nation\non its achievement and had suggested the two nations "could work\ntogether in the exploration of space." The results of this exchange\nwere a series of talks between Dryden of NASA and Anatoliy A.\nBlagonravov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. By the end of the\nyear they had agreed to exchanges of meteorological and magneticfield data and some communications experiments.\nA big year for the young American space program, 1962. Two\nmore Mercury flights, Carpenter for three orbits, then Schirra for six.\nThe powerful Saturn booster made its first two test flights, both\nsuccessful. The first active communications satellite, Telstar 1, was\nlaunched for AT&T by NASA; later NASA\'s own Relay communications\nsatellite was orbited; and the first international satellite, Britain\'s Ariel 1,\nwas launched by NASA to take scientific measurements of the\nionosphere. Mariner 2 became the first satellite to fly by another\nplanet; on 14 December it passed within 34400 kilometers of Venus\nand scanned the surface of that cloud-shrouded body, measuring its\ntemperatures. Then it continued into orbit about the sun, eventually\nsetting a new communications distance record of 89 million kilometers. The fifth and sixth Tiros meteorological satellites were\nplaced in orbit and continued to report the world\'s weather. So\nsuccessful had Tiros been that the R&D program had quickly\nbecome semioperational. The Weather Bureau was regularly integrating Tiros data into its operational forecasting and was busy\nplanning a full-scale weather satellite system which it would operate.\nAnd the hard work on booster reliability began to pay off-18\nsuccesses to 9 failures or partial successes.\nNot that all was sweetness and light. The Ranger, designed to\nphotograph the moon while falling to impact the lunar surface, was\nin deep trouble.

The crater in the upper left corner measured\nabout 91 meters in diameter and had an angular rock mass in its center which might\nhave been the cause oj the crater.\n\n36\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITU DE\n\nAs the dimensions of Apollo began to dawn on Congress and\nthe scientific community, there were rumbles: Apollo would preempt too much of the scientific manpower of the nation; Apollo was\nan "other worldly" stunt, directed at the moon instead of at pressing\nproblems on Earth. Administrator Webb met both of these caveats\nwith positive programs.\nIn acknowledgment of the drain on scientific manpower, Webb\nwon White House su pport for a broad program by NASA to augment\nthe scientific manpower pool. Thousands offellowships were offered\nfor graduate study in space-related disciplines, intended to replace\nor at least supplement the kinds of talent engulfed by the space\nprogram. Complementing the fellowships was an even more innovative program, government-financed buildings and facilities on\nuniversity campuses for the new kinds of interdisciplinary training\nthat the space program required.\nFrom a modest beginning in 1962, by the end of the program in\n1970 NASA had footed the bill for the graduate education of 5000\nscientists and engineers at a cost of over $100 million, had spent\nsome $32 million in construction of new laboratory facilities on 32\nuniversity campuses, and had given multidisciplinary grants to some\n50 universities that totaled more than $50 million. The program\nmarked a new direction in the government\'s recognition of its\nresponsibility for impact of its program on the civilian economy and\na new dimension of cooperation between the university and the\ngovernment. In part as a result of these new capabilities in the\nuniversities, NASA contracts and grants for research by universities\nrose from $21 million in 1962 to $101 million in 1968. The NASA\nuniversity program proved very effective: on the political side it\nreduced tensions between NASA and the scientific-engineering\ncommunity; on the score of national technology capability it\nenlarged and focused a large segment of the research capabilities of\nthe universities.\nTo refute the other charge-that Apollo would serve only its\nown ends and not the broader needs of the nation\'s economyWebb created the NASA technology utilization program in 1962. Its\nbasic purpose was to identify and hold up to the light the many items\nof space technology that could be or had been adapted for uses in the\ncivilian economy. By 1973 some 30000 such uses had been\nidentified and new ones were rolling in at the rate of 2000 a year.\nBut the program went beyond that. A concerted effort was made\nin every NASA center not only to identify possible transfers of space\n\nI-\n\nI\n\nThis synchrocyclotron in the Space Radiation Effects Laboratory is operated jor NASA by\nthe College of William and Mary, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Polytechnic\nInstitute.

NASA publications described all these potential applications\nto researchers and industry; seven regional dissemination centers\nwere established to work directly with industry on technical problems in the adaptation of space technology; in 1973 some 2000\ncompanies received direct help and another 57000 queries were\nanswered. New products ranged from quieter aircraft engines to\nmicrominiaturized and solid-state electronics that revolutionized\n1V sets, radios, and small electronic calculators. NASA\'s computer\nsoftware programs enabled a wide range of manufacturers to test the\nlife history of new systems- see predictions of problems that could\ndevelop, how the systems would perform, how long they would last,\netc. Many other facets of the space program were important to the\nquality and sustenance oflife for citizens of the United States and the\nworld:\nCommunications. Within a decade the communications satellite\n\n38\n\nORDERS OF MA G\n\nITU D E\n\nproved to be a reliable, flexible, cost-effective addition to long-range\ncommunications. The Communications Satellite Corporation became a solid financial success, with 114 000 stockholders. As\nmanager of the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium, it shared access to the global satellite system with 82 other\nnations who had become members of the consortium. Its array of\nsophisticated Intelsat communications satellites bracketed the world\nfrom synchronous orbit. Before these satellites existed, the total\ncapability for transoceanic telephone calls had been 500 circuits; in\n1973 the Intelsat satellites alone offered more than 4000 transoceanic circuits. Real-time TV coverage of events anywhere in the\nworld-whether Olympics, wars, or coronations-had become a\ncommonplace in the world\'s living rooms. Satellite data transmission enabled industries to control far-flung production and inventories, airlines to have instantaneous coast-to-coast reservation\nsystems, large banks to have nationwide data networks. And this\ncommunications revolution was only beginning. The next generation of communications satellite, Intelsat 5, started operations in\n1976 with five times the capacity of its predecessor Intelsat 4 and a life\nexpectancy of 10 years in orbit. In 1976 the Maritime Administration embarked on a global ship-control system operated by means of\nsatellites. Experiments with ATS satellites would continue to refine\nthe life-saving biomedical communication network which links\nmedical personnel and medical centers across the nation. Especially\nvaluable to isolated and rural areas, the network would afford them\nreal-time access to expert diagnosis and prescription of treatment.\nWeatherforecasting. Like its brother the communications satellite,\nthe weather satellite had in less than a decade become an established\nfriend of people around the world. Potentially disastrous hurricanes\nsuch as Camille in August 1969 and Agnes in June 1972 were\nspotted, tracked, and measured by the operational weather satellite\nnetwork of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThe real-time knowledge of the storm\'s position , intensity, and track\nmade possible accurate early warning and emergency evacuation\nthat saved hundreds of lives and millions of dollars in property\ndamage. Near-global rainfall maps were being produced by 1973\nfrom data acquired by NASA\'s Nimbus 5. Not only did the heatrelease information contained in such data markedly improve longrange weather forecasting, but the data were of immediate value in\nagriculture, flood control, etc. Ice-movement charts for the Arctic\nand Antarctic regions were extending shipping schedules in these\nareas by several months each year.\n\nI\n\nL\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 19 15- 1980\n\n39\n\nMedicine. NASA\'s experience in microminiaturized electronics\nand in protecting and monitoring the health of astronauts during\nspaceflight generated hundreds of medical devices and techniques\nthat could save lives and improve health care. Multidisciplinary\nteams of space technicians and medical researchers were successful\nin developing long-duration heart pacers, for instance. Implanted in\nthe patient\'s body but rechargeable from outside, the tiny pacer\nwould regulate the heartbeat for decades without replacement,\nwhereas the previous model required surgical replacement every two\nyears. Space-derived automatic patient monitoring systems were\nbeing used in more and more hospitals. Tiny sensors on the patient\'s\nbody would trigger an alarm when there was significant change in\ntemperature, heartbeat, blood pressure, or even in the oxygencarbon dioxide levels in the blood, a signal of the onset of shock. For\nresearchers living inside space simulators for long periods of time,\nthe Ames Research Center developed an aspirin-sized transmitter\npill. In general medical practice, the transmitter pill was swallowed\n\nThis laminar flow clean room and special clothing are used at St. Luke\'s Hospital,\nDenver, to lower risk ofinfection in hip10int replacements and other surgical procedures.\nBoth the room and the clothing were based on space-program experience and were\ndeveloped under NASA contract by the Martin Marietta Corp.\n\n40\n\nORD ERS OF MA G\n\nITU D E\n\nby the patient; as it moved through the digestive system it radioed to\nthe doctor diagnostic measurements of any of several kinds of deepbody conditions-temperatures, stomach acid levels, etc.\nEnergy. The nation\'s stepped-up program of energy research\nthat began in 1973 found NASA with broad experience and an inbeing program of research in devices that collect, store, transmit, and\napply solar, nuclear, and chemical energy for production of mechanical and electrical power. Solar cells had produced the electric power\nfor several generations of spacecraft; when arrays of them were\nexperimentally mounted on houses they supplied as much as threequarters of the energy needed to heat and cool the house. But solar\ncells were too expensive to be competitive with other systems; work\nwas continuing on improving their efficiency and on new manufacturing techniques that would cut their cost in half. A long-standing\nproblem with the efficient use of electrical energy has been the\ninability to store significant amounts of it for future use. NASA had\ndone much work on developing more compact, higher-storagecapacity, longer-life batteries. Nickel-cadmium batteries developed\nfor the space program were already in general use; they could be\nrecharged in 6 to 20 minutes instead of the 16 to 24 hours required\nfor conventional batteries. Silver-zinc batteries used in spacecraft\nwere too expensive for commercial use, but their unique separator\nmaterial could double the capacity of conventional nickel-zinc\nbatteries. An extensive trial of this adaptation was begun with the\nfleet of Postal Service electric trucks. Batteries with 5 to 20 times the\nstorage capacity of conventional mass-produced automobile batteries could have a wide range of uses: low-pollution automobile\npropulsion; storage of excess electrical power generated during lowdemand hours and release at times of peak demand, etc. Fuel cells\nhad been developed by NASA to provide the longer duration Gemini\nand Apollo flights with electrical power; on Earth they could be used\neither for energy storage or energy conversion. One of the ingredients used in fuel cells was hydrogen; in this application hydrogen\nwas broken down and combined with oxygen in a complex chemical\nprocess that produced water and electrical energy. But hydrogen is\nalso a superb high-performance, low-pollutant fuel whose source is\ninexhaustible. Liquid hydrogen had propelled men to and from the\nmoon. With its years of work with hydrogen as a rocket fuel, NASA\nhad more experience thaIl anyone else in the production, transportation, storage, pumping, and use of hydrogen. One possible use of\nhydrogen was as compact, clean energy that could be transported\n\nI\n\nA HISTORY Of\n\nACA A 0\n\nASA , 19 15- 198 0\n\n41\n\ninto large urban areas. Many kinds of Earth-based power plants\ncould burn hydrogen, alone or in various combinations, to produce\nenergy with low pollution side effects.\nAPOLLO IMPACT\n\nThe creation of NASA\'s university and technology transfer\nprograms in the early 1960s could be considered a side effect of\nApollo. There were others. All lunar reconnaissance programs had\nbeen impacted by Apollo. The latter part of Ranger had been\nreoriented; Surveyor, the first lunar softlander, was reconfigured to\nsupport Apollo. If Surveyor worked, it would provide on-the-lunarsurface photography plus televised digging in the surface of the\nmoon for a better sense of soil composition. The remaining problem\nfor Apollo was the need for detailed mapping photography of the\nmoon. So by the end of 1963 a third program was initiated - Lunar\nOrbiter, a state-of-the-art mapping satellite that would go into orbit\naround the moon and photograph potential landing zones for\nApollo.\nThe vexing questions of rendezvous and extravehicular activity\nstill had to be answered. So on 3 January 1962 NASA announced a\nnew manned spaceflight project, Gemini . Using the basic configuration of the Mercury capsule enlarged to hold a two-man crew,\nGemini was to fit between Mercury and Apollo and provide early\nanswers to assist the design work on Apollo. The launch vehicle\nwould be the Titan II missile being developed by the Air Force. More\npowerful than Atlas and Titan I, it would have the thrust to put the\nlarger spacecraft into Earth orbit. For a target vehicle with which\nGemini could rendezvous, NASA chose the Air Force\'s Agena;\nlaunched by an Atlas, the second-stage Agena had a restartable\nengine that enabled it to have both passive and active roles. Gemini\nwould be managed by the same Space Task Group that was operating\nMercury; the project director would be James A. Chamberlin, an\nearly advocate of an enlarged Mercury capsule.\nGemini began as a Mark II Mercury, a " quick and dirty"\nprogram. The only major engineering change aside from scale-up\nwas to modularize the various electrical and control assemblies and\nplace them outside the inner shell of the spacecraft to simplify\nmaintenance. But perhaps not an engineer alive could have left it at\nthat. After all, Gemini was supposed to bridge to Apollo, wasn\'t it?\nHere was a chance to try out ideas. If they worked, they would be\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n-.J\n\n42\n\nORDERS OF MAG\n\nITUDE\n\navailable for Apollo. There was the paraglider, for example, that\nFrancis Rogallo had been experimenting with at Langley. If that\nworked, Gemini could forget parachutes and water landings with\nhalf the Navy out there; with a paraglider Gemini could land\nroutinely on land. And the spacecraft should be designed to have\nmore aerodynamic lift than Mercury, so the pilot would have more\nlanding control. And fuel cells instead of batteries; with enough\nelectric power you could have longer duration fhghts. And fighterplane-type ejection seats for crew abort, superseding the launch\nescape rocket that perched on top of Mercury.\nAll these innovations were cranked into the program, and\ncontracts and subcontracts were let for their design and fabrication.\nSoon the monthly bills for Gemini were running far beyond what\nhad been budgeted. In every area, it seemed, there were costly\nproblems. The paraglider and ejection seats wouldn\'t stabilize in\nflight; the fuel cell leaked; Titan II had longitudinal oscillations-the\n\nManned Spacecraft Center, 1970. RenamedJohnson Space Center in 1973, this has\nbeen the lead center Jor the design and development of manned spacecraft and Jor the\noperational control of manned spaceflights.\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nL\n\n________________ J\n\nA HISTORY OF\n\nACA AND\n\nASA , 19 15- 198 0\n\n43\n\ndreaded "pogo" effect-too severe for manned flights; Agena had\nreconfiguration problems. Cost overruns had become severe by late\n1962; by March 1963 they were critical. The original program cost of\n$350 million had zoomed to over $1 billion -$200 million higher\nthan the figures Associate Administrator Seamans had used in\nCongress a few days before! Charles W. Mathews, the new program\nmanager, cracked down. Flight schedules were stretched out; the\nparaglider gradually slid out of the program. By early 1964 most of\nthe engineering problems were responding to treatment.\nWith the Mercury program, the spacecraft design role in Apollo,\nand now Gemini, it was clear that the Space Task Group needed a\nhome of its own and some growing room. On 19 September 1961 ,\nAdministrator Webb announced that a new Manned Spacecraft\nCenter would be built on the outskirts of Houston. It would house\nthe enlarged Space Task Group, now upgraded to a center, and\nwould have operational control of all manned missions as well as be\nthe developer of manned spacecraft. Water access to the Gulf of\nMexico was provided by the ship canal to Galveston .\n\nMichoud Operations, 1965.\n\nThe Mississippi Test Facility headquarters building, 1966. It is now the National Space\nTechnology Laboratories.\n\nWater access played a role in all site selection for new Apollo\nfacilities. The big Michoud Ordnance Plant outside New Orleans,\nwhere the 10-meter-diameter Saturn V first stage would be fabricated, was on the Mississippi River; the Mississippi Test Facility, with\nits huge test stands for static firing tests of the booster stages, was just\noff the Gulf of Mexico, in Pearl River County, Mississippi.\nAll this effort would come together at the launch site at Cape\nCanaveral, Florida, where NASA had a small Launch Operations\nCenter, headed by Kurt H. Debus. NASA had been a tenant there,\nusing Air Force launch facilities and tracking range. Now Apollo\nloomed. Apollo would require physical facilities much too large to fit\non the crowded Cape. For safety\'s sake there would have to be large\nbuffer zones of land around the launch pads; if a catastrophic\naccident occurred , where all stages of the huge launch vehicle\nexploded at once, the force of the detonation would approach that of\na small atomic bomb. So NASA sought and received congressional\napproval to purchase 450 square kilometers of Merritt Island, just\nnorthwest of the Air Force facilities. Lying between the Banana River\nand the Atlantic and populated mostly by orange growers, Merritt\nIsland had the requisite water access and safety factors.\nPlanners struggled through 1961 with a wide range of concepts\nand possibilities for the best launch system for Apollo, hampered by\nhaving only a gross knowledge of how the vehicle would be\n\n[\nA HI TORY OF\n\nACA A D\n\nASA , 19 15- 1980\n\n45\n\nconfigured, what the missions would involve, and how frequent the\nlaunches would be. Finally on 21 July 1962 NASA announced its\nchoice: the Advanced Saturn (later Saturn V) launch vehicle would be\ntransported to the new Launch Operations Center on Merritt Island\nstage by stage; the stages would be erected and checked out in an\nenormous vehicle assembly building; the vehicle would be transported to one of the four launch pads several miles away by a huge\ntractor crawler. This system was a major departure from previous\npractice at the Cape; launch vehicles had usually been erected on the\nlaunch pad and checked out there. Under the new concept the\nvehicle would be on the launch pad a much shorter time, allowing for\na higher launch rate and better protection against weather and salt\nspray. As with the other new Apollo facilities, the Corps of Engineers\nwould supervise the vast construction project.\nThe simultaneous building of facilities and hardware was going\nto take a great deal of money and a great many skilled people. The\nNASA budget, $966.7 million in fiscal 1961 , was $1.825 billion in FY\n1962. It hit $3.674 billion the next year and by FY 1964 was $5.1\n\nKennedy Space Center, 1966. A I11 -meter-tall Saturn V launch vehicle has emerged\nfrom the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building on its 1820-metric-ton crawler and\nbegun its stately processional to the launch complex five kilometers away.\n\n46\n\nORDERS OF MAG\n\nITUDE\n\nbillion. It would remain near that level for three more years. In\npersonnel, NASA grew in those same years from 17 471 to 35 860.\nAnd of course this was small potatoes compared to the mushrooming contractor and university force where 90 percent of NASA\'s\nmoney was spent. When the Apollo production line peaked in 1967,\nmore than 400000 people were working on some aspect of Apollo.\nIndeed, as the large bills began to come in, there was some\nwincing in the political system. President Kennedy wondered briefly\nif the goal was worth the cost; in 1963 Congress had its first real\nadversary debate on Apollo. Administrator Webb had to point out\nagain and again that this was not a one-shot trip to the moon but the\nbuilding of a national space capability that would have many uses.\nHe also needled congressmen with the fact that the Soviets were still\nahead; in 1963 they were orbiting two-man spacecraft, flying a 208kilometer-orbit tandem mission, and orbiting an unmanned prototype of a new spacecraft. Support rallied. The Senate rejected an\namendment that would have cut the FY 1964 space budget by $500\nmillion. The speech that President Kennedy was driving through\nDallas to deliver on that fateful 22 November 1963 would have\ndefended the expenditures for the space program:\nThis effo rt is expensive- but it pays its own way, fo r freedo m and fo r Ameri ca . .\n. . Th ere is no longer any doubt abo ut the strength and skill of American\nscience, American industry, American educatio n and th e American free\nenterprise system. In short, our national space effort represents a great gain in ,\nand a great reso urce of, o ur national strength.\n\nAs 1963 drew to a close, NASA could feel that it was on top of its\njob. The master plan for Apollo was drawn; the organization and the\nkey men were in place. Mercury had ended with L. Gordon Cooper\'s\n22-orbit flight, far beyond the design limits of the spacecraft. For\nthose Americans old enough to have thrilled to Lindbergh\'s historic\ntransatlantic flight 36 years earlier, it was awesome that in only 50\nminutes more flight time, Cooper had flown 955000 kilometers to\nLindbergh\'s 5000. Of 13 NASA launches during the year, 11 were\nsuccessful. In addition to improved performance from the established launch vehicles, Saturn I had another successful test flight, as\ndid the troublesome Centaur. The Syncom 2 communications satelljte achieved synchronous orbit and from that lofty perch transmitted voice and teletype communications between North America,\nSouth America, and Africa. The Explorer 18 scientific satellite sailed\nout in a long elliptical orbit to measure radiation most of the way to\nthe moon.\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n3\nTortoise Becomes Hare\nAs 1964 dawned, the worst of Gemini\'s troubles were behind.\nThe spacecraft for the first flight was already at the Kennedy Space\nCenter (Launch Operations Center, renamed in November 1963 by\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson), being minutely checked out for the\nflight. Too minutely, too time-consumingly. Not until 8 April did\nGemini 1 lift off unmanned into an orbit which confirmed the launch\nvehicle-spacecraft combination in the rigors of launch. The excessive checkout time of Gemini 1 generated a new procedure. Beginning\nwith the next spacecraft, a contingent from the launch crew would\nwork at the factory (McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis) to check out the\nspacecraft there. When it arrived at the Cape, it would be ready to be\nmated with its Titan II, have the pyrotechnics installed, and be\nlaunched. Only in this way could one hope to achieve the threemonth launch cycle planned for Gemini.\nThe new system delayed the arrival of the second Gemini\nspacecraft at the Cape. There the curse set in. Once on the pad the\nspacecraft was struck by lightning, threatened by not one but two\nhurricanes, and forced to undergo check after check. And when\nlaunch day finally came in December, the engines ignited and then\nshut down. More rework. Finally on 19 January 1965, Gemini 2 rose\nfrom the launch pad on the tail of almost colorless flame from Titan\nII\'s hypergolic propellants, and in a 19-minute flight confirmed the\nreadiness of a fully equipp~d Gemini spacecraft and the integrity of\nthe heatshield during reentry. Gemini was man-rated.\nThe final test flight, a manned, three-orbit qualification flight,\nwas conducted on 23 March without incident. Now the diversified\nflight program could continue. One program objective was to orbit\nmen in space for at least the week that it would take an Apollo flight to\ngo to the moon, land, and return. Gemini 4 (3-7 June) stayed aloft four\ndays; Gemini 5 (21-29 August) doubled that time and surpassed the\nSoviet long-duration record; Gemini 7 (4- 18 December) provided the\nclincher with 14 days (330 hours 35 minutes). Of more lasting\nimportance than the durability of the equipment was the encouraging medical news that no long-term harmful effects were found from\n47\n\n48\n\nORD ERS OF MAGN IT UD E\n\nextended exposure to weightlessness. There were temporary effects,\nof course: heartbeat slowed down, blood tended to pool in the legs,\nthe bones lost calcium, etc., but these conditions tended to stabilize\nafter a few days in weightlessness and to return to normal after a few\ndays back on Earth. So far there seemed to be no physiological time\nlimit for man living in space.\nA crucial question for Apollo was whether the three rendezvous\nand docking maneuvers planned for every lunar flight were feasible .\nGemini 3 made the tentative beginning by testing the new thruster\nrockets with short-burst firings that changed the height and shape of\norbit, and one maneuver that for the first time shifted the plane of the\nflight path of a spacecraft. Gemini 4 tried to rejoin its discarded\nsecond-stage booster but faulty techniques burned up too much\nmaneuvering fuel and the pursuit had to be abandoned-a valuable\nlesson; back to the computers for better techniques! Gemini 5 tested\nout the techniques and verified the performance of the rendezvous\nradar and rendezvous display in the cockpit.\nThen carne what is still referred to by NASA control room\npeople with pride but also with slight shudders as "Gemini 76." The\noriginal mission plan called for a target Agena stage to be placed in\norbit and for Gemini to launch in pursuit of it. But the Agena fell\nshort of orbit and splashed into the Atlantic. The Gemini spacecraft\nsuddenly had no mission. Round-the-clock debate and recomputation produced a seemingly bizarre solution, which within three days\nof the Agena failure was approved by Administrator Webb and\nPresident Johnson: remove the Gemini 6 spacecraft-launch vehicle\ncombination intact from the launch pad and store it carefuUy to\npreserve the integrity of checkout; erect Gemini 7 on the launch pad,\ncheck it out and launch it; bring Gemini 6 out and launch it to\nrendezvous with the long-duration Gemini 7. And it happened.\nGemini 7 was launched 4 December 1965; Gemini 6 was back on the\npad for launch by 12 December. On launch day the engines ignited,\nburned for four seconds, shut off automatically when a trouble light\nlit up . On top of the fueled booster Astronaut Walter M. Schirra,Jr.,\nsat with his hand on the lanyard of the ejection seat while the control\nroom checked out the condition of the fueled booster. But the\npotential bomb did not explode. On 15 December Gemini 6 lifted off\nto join its sister ship in orbit. On his fourth orbit Schirra caught up to\nGemini 7 and maneuvered to within 10 meters; in subsequent\nmaneuvers he moved to within 30 centimeters. Rendezvous was\nfeasible. Was docking?\n\nA HI STORY O F NACA AN D NASA , 19 15- 1980\n\n49\n\nOn 16 March 1966, Gemini 8 on its third orbit docked with ltS\nAgena target. Docking too was feasible, though in this case not for\nlong. Less than half an hour after docking for an intended full night\nin the docked position, the two spacecraft unaccountably began to\nspin, faster and faster. Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong could not\nstabilize the joined spacecraft, so he fired his Gemini thrusters to\nundock and maneuver away from the Agena. Still he could not\ncontrol his single spacecraft with the thrusters; lives seemed in\njeopardy. Finally he fired the reentry rockets, which did the job. By\nthen ground control had figured out that one thruster had stuck in\nthe firing position. Armstrong made an emergency landing off\nOkinawa. Despite hardware problems, docking had been established as feasible.\nRendezvous was new and difficult, so experimentation continued. Gemini 9 (3- 6 June 1966) tried three kinds of rendezvous\nmaneuvers with a special target stage as its passive partner, but\ndocking was not possible because the shroud covering the target\'s\ndocking mechanism had not separated. The shroud did not prevent\nsimulation of an Apollo lunar orbit rendezvous. Gemini 10 (18-21\nJuly 1966) did dock with its Agena target and used the powerful\nAgena engine to soar to a height of 766 kilometers, the highest in\nspace man had ventured. It rendezvoused with the derelict Agena\nleft in orbit by Gemini 8 four months earlier, using only optical\nmethods and thereby demonstrating the feasibility of rendezvous\nwith passive satellites for purposes of repairing them. On the next\nflight Gemini 11 caught up with its target in its first orbit, demonstrating the possibility of quick rendezvous if necessary for rescue or\nother reasons. Each astronaut practiced docking twice. Using Agena\npropulsion, they rocketed Out to 1372 kilometers above the earth,\nanother record. The final Gemini flight, Gemini 12 (11 November\n1966) rendezvoused with its target Agena on the third orbit and kept\nstation with it.\nWould astronauts be able to perform useful work outside their\nspacecraft when in orbit or on the moon? This was the question\nextravehicular activity (EVA) was designed to answer. The answers\nproved to be various and more difficult than had been envisioned.\nGemini 4 began EVA when Edward H. White II floated outside\nhis spacecraft for 23 minutes. Protected by his spacesuit and attached\nto Gemini by an eight-meter umbilical cord, White used a hand-held\nmaneuvering unit to move about, took photographs, and in general\nhad such an exhilarating experience that he had to be ordered back\n\nThis photo looks out Gemini II \'s window at the Agena rocket with which the Gemini\ncrew is practicing rendezvous and tethered stationkeeping.\n\ninto the spacecraft. Because he had no specific work tasks to perform,\nhis EVA seemed deceptively easy.\nThat illusion was rudely shattered by the experience of Gemini 9,\nwhen Eugene A. Cernan spent two hours in EVA; he had tasks to\nperform in several areas on the spacecraft. His major assignment was\nto go behind the spacecraft into the adapter area, put on the 75kilogram astronaut maneuvering unit-a more powerful individual\nflight propulsion system the Air Force had built-and try it out. The\neffort to get the unit harnessed to his back was so intense that\nexcessive perspiration within his spacesuit overtaxed the system and\nfogged his visor. The experiment was abandoned and he was\nordered back into the spacecraft.\nMuch more pleasant was the experience of Michael Collins on\nGemini 10. He tried two kinds of EVA: the first time he stood in the\nopen hatch for 45 minutes and made visual observations and took\npictures; the second time he went out on a lO-meter tether,\nmaneuvered for 55 minutes with the hand-held maneuvering unit\nand even propelled himself over to the station-keeping Agena\nand removed a micrometeoroid-impact experiment which had been\nin space for four months.\n\nL_________________ _\n\nAmerica\'s first space walk.. Astronaut Edward H. White II fired short bursts with his\nhand-held maneuvering gun to move around in the zero g ofspace before returning to the\nGemini 4 spacecraft.\n\nBut reality raised its ugly head again during Gemini 11 when\nRichard F. Gordon, Jr., was assigned a full schedule of work tasks\nalong the spacecraft but had to terminate after 33 minutes because of\nfatigue . He had battled himself to exhaustion trying to control his\nbodily movements and fight against the opposite torque that any\nsimple motion set in train. It was Isaac Newton\'s Third Law of\nMotion in pure form.\nNASA had learned its lesson. When Gemini 12 went up, many\nadditional body restraints and hand- and footholds had been added.\nAstronauts had trained for the strange floating sensation by doing\nthe same assignments in water tanks on Earth. Results were\ngratifying; in a 2-hour 6-minute tethered EVA (aside from two\nstandup EVAs) Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., successfully performed 19\n\n52\n\nORDERS OF MAG\n\n[T U D E\n\nseparate tasks. Total EVA on this flight added up to 5 hours 28\nminutes.\nOn the last seven flights, Gemini experimented with the\naerodynamic lift of the spacecraft to ensure pinpoint landings on the\nearth\'s surface; with the dispersions possible when Apollo came in\nfrom 370000 kilometers away, tired astronauts would need this. The\ninertial guidance system provided inputs to the computer, which\nsolved the guidance equations. On flights 6-10 the reentry was\ncontrolled by the crew. On the last two flights the data were fed into\nthe automatic system. Results were promising. The average navigational accuracy of the seven flights was within 3 kilometers of the\naiming point, much better than previous flights .\nGemini was primarily a technological learning experience. So it\nis not surprising that of the 52 experiments in the program, more\nthan half-27 -were technological, exploring the limits of the\nequipment. But there were also 17 scientific experiments and 8\nmedical ones. An important one was the 1400 color photographs\ntaken of Earth from various altitudes. This provided the investigators\nthe first large corpus of color photographs from which to learn more\nabout the planet we live on.\nProbably the most valuable management payoff from Gemini\nwas the operational one: how to live and maneuver in space; next was\nhow to handle a variety of situations in space by exploiting the\nversatility and depth of the vast NASA-contractor team that stood by\nduring flights. Finally there were valuable fiscal lessons: an advanced\ntechnology program had a "best path" between too slow and too fast.\nDeviation on either side, as had occurred in the early days of Gemini,\ncould cost appalling amounts of money. But once on track, even\neconomies were possible. Once Gemini flights were on track, for\nexample, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight George\nE. Mueller (successor to Holmes) had won agreement from his\nprincipal contractors to cut the three-month period between launches\nto two months. This was primarily to get Gemini out of the way\nbefore Apollo launches started, but it paid off financially, too; where\ntotal program costs for Gemini were estimated in FY 1964 to be $1.35\nbillion, the actual cost closed out at $1.29 billion.\nThis, then, was Gemini, a versatile, flexible spacecraft system\nthat wound up exploring many more nooks and crannies of\nspaceflight than its originators ever foresaw-which is as it should be.\nMtY0r lessons were transmitted to Apollo: rendezvous, yes; docking,\nyes; EVA, yes; manned flights up to two weeks in duration, yes .\n\nA HI STORY OF NACA AND NASA , 19 15- 198 0\n\n53\n\nEqually important, there was now a big experience factor for the\nastronauts and for the people on the ground, in the control room,\naround the tracking network, in industry. The system had proved\nitself in the pit; it had evolved a total team that had solved real-time\nproblems in space with men\'s lives at stake. This was no mean legacy\nto Apollo.\nSome of the technological payoff had come too late. With the\nincreasing sophistication of Gemini and the consequent slippage of\nboth financial and engineering schedules, the Apollo designers and\nengineers sometimes had to invent their own wheel. But the state of\nthe art had been advanced: thrusters, fuel cells, environmental\ncontrol systems, space navigation, spacesuits, etc. In the development stage of Apollo the bank of knowledge from Gemini paid off in\nhundreds of subtle ways. The bridge had been built.\nThroughout Gemini\'s operational period, Apollo was slogging\nalong toward completed stages and completed spacecraft. Saturn I,\nthe booster almost overtaken by events, finished its 10-flight\nprogram in 1964 and 1965 with six launches featuring a liquidhydrogen second stage. Not only was it proved out; the clusteredengine concept was demonstrated and an early form of Apollo\nguidance was tested. The last four flights were considered operational; one (18 September 1964) tested a boilerplate Apollo spacecraft. The Last three carried Pegasus meteoroid-detection satellites\ninto orbit. The last two Saturn Is were fabricated entirely by industry,\nmarking a transition from the Army-arsenal in-house concept that\nhad previously characterized the Marshall Space Flight Center. Ten\nLaunches, ten successes.\nMeanwhile the larger brother, the Saturn lB, was being born . Its\nfirst stage was to generate 7100 kilonewtons of thrust, from eight of\nthe H-1 engines that had powered Atlas and Saturn I, but up rated to\n890 kilonewtons each. The second stage was to feature the new J-2\nliquid hydrogen engine, generating 890 kilonewtons of thrust. It was\na crucial element of the forthcoming Saturn V vehicle, since in a fiveengine cluster it would power the second stage and a single J-2 would\npower the third stage.\nSaturn lB was the first launch vehicle to be affected by a new\nconcept, "all-up" testing. Associate Administrator Mueller, pressed\nby budgetary constraints and relying on his industry experience in\nthe Air Force\'s Minuteman ballistic missile program, pressed NASA\nto abandon its stage-by-stage testing. With intensive ground testing\nof components, he argued, NASA could with reasonable confidence\n\n54\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\ntest the entire stack of stages in flight from the beginning, at great\nsavings to budget and schedule. Marshall engineers had built their\nsplendid success record by being conservative; they vigorously\nopposed the new concept. But eventually Mueller triumphed. On 26\nFebruary 1966, the complete Saturn IB flew with the Apollo\ncommand and service module in suborbital flight; the payload was\nrecovered in good condition. On 5 July the IB second stage, the\ninstrument unit-which would house the electronic and guidance\nbrains of the Saturn V-and the nose cone were propelled into orbit.\nThe total payload was 28 332 kilograms, the heaviest the U.S. had yet\norbited. On 26 August a suborbital launch qualified the Apollo\ncommand module for manned flight; the attached service module\nfired its engine four times; and an accelerated reentry trajectory\ntested the Apollo heatsh ield at the 40 000-kilometer-per-hour velocity of a spacecraft returning from lunar distance.\nThe largest brother, Saturn V, was still being pieced together.\nDeveloped by three different contractors, the three stages of Saturn V\nhad individual histories and problems. The first stage, although the\nlargest, had a long lead time and was on schedule. The third stage,\nthough enlarged and sophisticated from the version flown on Saturn\nIB, had a previous history. It was the second stage that was the newest\nbeast-five J-2 engines burning liquid hydrogen. It became the\npacing item of the Saturn V and would remain so almost until the first\nlaunch.\nOf the three spacecraft, the lunar module was, early and late, the\nproblem child. For one thing, it was begun late-a whole year late.\nFor another, it differed radically from previous spacecraft. There\nwere two discrete spacecraft within the lunar module; one would\ndescend to the lunar surface from lunar orbit; the other would\nseparate from the descent stage and leap off the lunar surface into\nlunar orbit and rendezvous with the command module. The engine\nfor each stage would have to work perfectly for that one time it fired.\nBoth had teething troubles. The descent engine was particularly\ntroublesome, to the point that a second contract was let for a backup\nengine of different design. Weight was a never-ending problem with\nthe LM. Each small change in a system, each substitution of one\nmaterial for another, had to be considered as much in terms of\nkilograms added or saved as in any gain in system efficiency.\nBy the end of 1966, the Saturn IB and the block I Apollo\ncommand and service module were considered man-rated.\nOn 27 January 1967, AS-204, to be the first manned spaceflight,\n\nA HISTORY OF\n\nACA A D\n\nASA , 19 15- \\ 980\n\n55\n\nwas on the launch pad at Cape Kennedy, moving through preflight\ntests. Astronauts Virgil!. Grissom, Edward H . White II, and Roger B.\nChaffee were suited up in the command module, moving through\nthe countdown toward a simulated launch. At T-minus-lO minutes\ntragedy struck without warning. As Maj. Gen . Samuel C. Phillips,\nApollo program director, described it the next day: "The facts briefly\nare: at 6:31 p.m. (EST) the observers heard a report which originated\nThe seared Apollo command module in which three astronauts lost their lives stands in\nmute desolation at Cape Canaveral.\n\n"\n--7 .....;..- - -\n\n56\n\nORDERS OF MAG ITUDE\n\nfrom one of the crewmen that there was a fire aboard the spacecraft ..\n. ." Ground crew members saw a flash fire break through the\nspacecraft shell and envelop the spacecraft in smoke, Phillips said.\nRescue attempts failed. It took a tortuous five minutes to get the\nhatch open from the outside. Long before that the three astronauts\nwere dead from asphyxiation. It was the first fatal accident in the\nAmerican spaceflight program.\nShock swept across the nation and the world. In the White\nHouse, President Johnson had just presided over the signing of an\ninternational space law treaty when Administrator Webb phoned\nwith the crushing news. Webb said the next day: "We\'ve always\nknown that something like this would happen sooner or later ... who\nwould have thought the first tragedy would be on the ground?"\nWho, indeed? What had happened? How had it happened?\nCould it happen again? Was someone at fault? If so, who? There\nwere many questions, few answers. The day following the fire,\nDeputy Administrator Seamans appointed an eight-member review\nboard to investigate the accident. As chairman he chose Floyd L.\nThompson, the veteran director of the Langley Research Center. For\nmonths the board probed the evidence, heard witnesses, studied\ndocumentation. On 10 April Webb, Seamans, Mueller, and Thompson briefed the House space committee on the findings: the fire had\napparently been started by an electrical short circuit which ignited\nthe oxygen-rich atmosphere and fed on combustible materials in the\nspacecraft. The precise wire at fault could probably never be\ndetermined. Like most accidents it should not have happened. There\nhad been errors in design, faults in testing procedures. But the basic\nspacecraft design was sound. A thorough review of spacecraft design,\nwiring, combustible materials, test procedures, etc., was under way.\nCongress was not satisfied. Hearings in both houses continued,\ngradually eroding Webb\'s support on Capitol Hill.\nThe block I spacecraft would not be used for any manned\nflights. The hatch on the block II spacecraft would be redesigned for\nquick opening. The hundreds of miles of wiring in the spacecraft were\nchecked for fire-proofing, protection against damage, etc. An\nintensive materials research program devised substitute materials\nfor combustible ones. In effect the block II spacecraft was completely\nredesigned and rebuilt. The cost: 18 months delay in the manned\nflight schedule and at least $50 million. The gain: a sounder, safer\nspacecraft.\nWell before men flew in Apollo spacecraft the question had\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nA HI STORY OF NA CA A 0 NASA , 19 15- 1980\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n[\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\\\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n57\n\nbeen raised as to what, if anything, NASA proposed to do with men\nin space after Apollo was over. With the long lead times and heavy\ncosts inherent in manned space programs, advance planning was\nessential. President Johnson proposed the question to Webb in a\nletter on 30 January 1964. NASA\'s first-look answer surfaced in\ncongressional hearings on the FY 1965 budget. Funds were requested\nfor study contracts that would investigate a variety of ideas for doing\nnew things in space with the expensively acquired Apollo hardware.\nPossibilities: long-duration Earth-orbital operations, lunar surface\nexploration operating out of an unmanned Apollo lunar module\nlanded on the moon, long-duration lunar orbital missions to survey\nand map the moon, Earth-orbital operations leading to space\nstations.\nThrough 1965 and 1966 the studies intensified and options\nwere fleshed out. The Woods Hole conference in the summer of\n1965 brought together a broad spectrum of the American science\ncommunity and identified some 150 scientific experiments that were\ncandidates for such missions. By 1966 there was a sense of urgency in\nNASA planning; the Apollo production line was peaking and would\nbegin to decline in a year or two. Unless firm requirements for\nadditional boosters, spacecraft, and other systems could be delineated and funded soon, the production lines would shut down and the\nhard-won Apollo skills dispersed. In the FY 1967 congressional\nhearings, NASA presented further details and fixed the next fiscal\nyear as the latest that hardware commitments could be deferred if the\nApollo production line was to be used.\nNASA went into the FY 1968 budget cycle with a fairly ambitious\nApollo Applications proposal. It asked for an FY 1968 appropriation\nof $626 million as the down payment on six Saturn IBs, six Saturn Vs,\nand eight Apollo spacecraft per year. The Bureau of the Budget\napproved a budget request of $454 million. This cut the program by\none-third. Congress appropriated only $253 million, so by mid1968 the plan was down to only two additional Saturn IBs and one\norbital workshop, with it and its Apollo telescope mount being\ndeferred to 1971.\nManned spaceflight, with its overwhelming priority, had had\nboth direct and indirect impact on the NASA space science program.\nFrom 1958 to 1963, scientific satellites had made impressive\ndiscoveries: the Van Allen radiation belts, Earth\'s magnetosphere,\nthe existence of the solar wind. Much of the space science effort in the\nnext four years had been directed toward finding more detailed data\n\n58\n\nORDERS OF MAG\n\nITUDE\n\non these extensive phenomena. The radiation belts were found to be\nindeed plural, with definite if shifting altitudes. The magnetosphere\nwas found to have an elongated tail reaching out beyond the moon\nand through which the moon periodically passes. The solar wind was\nshown to vary greatly in intensity with solar activity.\nAll of these were momentous discoveries about our nearby\nspace environment. The first wave of discoveries said one thing to\nNASA: if you put up bigger, more sophisticated, more versatile\nsatellites than those of the first generation, you will find many other\nunsuspected phenomena that might help unravel the history of the\nsolar system, the universe, and the cosmic mystery of how it all\nworks. So a second generation of spacecraft was planned and\ndeveloped; they were called observatory class - five to ten times as\nheavy as early satellites, built around a standard bus instrumented\nfor a specific scientific discipline, but designed to support up to 20\ndiscrete experimental instruments that could be varied from one\n\nI\nI\n\nSurveyor 7, perched on the lunar surface in the highlands about 29 kilometers north of\nthe big crater Tycho, took the photographs in this panoramic mosaic ofthe area around its\nlanding site.

As these complex spacecraft were developed and launched in the mid-1960s, the first results were on the\nwhole disappointing. The promise was confirmed by fleeting results,\nbut their very complexity inflicted them with short lifetimes and\nelectrical failures. There were solid expectations that these could be\nworked out for subsequent launches. But by the late 1960s the\nimpingement of manned spaceflight budgets on space science\nbudgets reduced or eliminated many of these promising starts.\nSmaller satellites, such as the Pioneer series, survived and made\nvaluable observations, measuring the solar wind, solar plasma\ntongues, and the interplanetary magnetic field .\nLunar programs fared somewhat better but did not come away\nunscathed. The lunar missions were now in support of Apollo, so\nthey were allowed to run their course. Surveyor softlanded six out of\nits seven spacecraft on the moon from 1966 through 1968. Its\ntelevision cameras gave Earthlings their first limited previews of\nLunar Orbiter 2 appears in this telephoto shot to be inside the huge lunar crater\nCopernicus.

Distance across this part of the crater is about 27 kilometers.\n\nMariner 4, at a slant range of 1250 kilometers, took this photo ofMare Cimmerium on\nMars. With craters pockmarked try newer craters, Mars looked depressingly like the moon.\n\nghostly lunar landscapes seen from the surface level. Its instruments\nshowed that lunar soil was the consistency of wet sand, firm enough\nto support lunar landings by the LM. Lunar Orbiter put mapping\ncameras in orbit around the moon in all of its five missions,\nphotographed over 90% of the lunar surface, including the invisible\nback side, and surveyed potential Apollo landing sites.\nPlanetary programs suffered heavy cuts. The Mariner series was\ncut back, but its two flights provided exciting new glimpses into the\nhistory of the solar system. Mariner 4 flew past Mars on 14 July 1965\nand gave man his first close-up view of Earth\'s fabled neighbor. At\nfirst glance the view was disappointing. Mars was battered by meteor\nimpacts almost as much as the moon. While there were no magnetic\nfields or radiation belts, there was a thin atmosphere. Mariner 5 flew\npast Venus on 19 October 1967; this second pass at mysterious\nVenus found no magnetic field but an ionosphere that deflected the\nsolar wind . The atmosphere was dense and very hot; temperatures\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA, 19 15- 19 80\n\n61\n\nwere recorded as high as 700 K, with 80% of the atmosphere being\ncarbon dioxide. But the immediate future of more sophisticated\nplanetary exploration seemed bleak. The ambitious Voyager program was curtailed in FY 1966, fiqally dropped in FY 1968; it\nenvisioned large planetary spacecraft launched on Saturn V which\nwould deploy Mars entry capsules weighing 2270 to 3180 kilograms.\nThe applications satellites had been a crowning achievement for\nNASA in the early 1960s. The NASA policy of bringing a satellite\nsystem along through the research and development stages to flight\ndemonstration of the system and then turning it over to someone\nelse to convert into an operational system received its acid test in\n1962. With the demonstration of Syncom performance, the commercial potential of communications satellites became obvious and\nimmediate. NASA\'s R&D role seemed over, but how should the\nvaluable potential be transferred to private ownership without\nfavoritism? The Kennedy administration\'s answer was the Communications Satellite Corporation, a unique government-industryinternational combination. The board of directors would be made\nup of six named by the communications industry, six by public\nstockholders, and three named by the President of the United States.\nThe corporation would be empowered to invite other nations to\nshare the investment, the services, and the profits. This precedentsetting proposal stirred strong political emotions, especially in the\nSenate. A 20-day debate ensued, including a filibuster, the timehonored last resort in cases of deeply divisive issues , before the\nadministration proposal was approved . On 3 1 August 1962, President Kennedy signed the bill into law. ComSatCorp , as it came to be\ncalled, set up in business. On 6 April 1965, its first satellite, Early Bird\n1, was launched into synchronous orbit by NASA on a reimbursable\nbasis. By the end of 1968 , there was an Intelsat network of five\ncommunications satellites in synchronous orbits, some 20 of an\nexpected 40 ground stations in operation, and 48 member nations\nparticipating. The Soviets had mounted a competitive system of\nMolniya satellites with first launch in 1965. They\xc2\xb7 too had sought\ninternational partnership, but only France outside of the Iron\nCurtain countries signed up. By 1968 they had launched 10 Molniya\nsatellites into their standard elliptical orbit. On the American side,\nthe question of government-sponsored research on communications\nsatellites was not completely solved by the creation of ComSatCorp.\nCongress continued to worry over the thorny question of whether\nthe government should carry on advanced research on communica-\n\n62\n\nORD ERS O F M AGN ITU D E\n\ntions satellites versus the prospect that a government-sponsored\nmonopoly would profit from the results .\nWeather satellites were simpler in the sense that the relationship\nwas confined to two government agencies. The highly successful\nTiros was seized on by the Weather Bureau as the model for its\noperational satellite series. NASA had high hopes for its follow-on\nNimbus satellite, bigger, with more instruments measuring more\nparameters. The Weather Bureau, however, felt that unless NASA\ncould guarantee a long operational lifetime for Nimbus, it was too\nexpensive for routine use. So NASA continued Nimbus as a test bed\nfor advanced sensors that could provide better measurements of the\nvertical structure of the atmosphere and global collection of weather\ndata.\nNavigational satellites, one of the early bright possibilities of\nspace, continued to be intractable. But there was a new entry, the\nEarth resources satellite. Impressed by the Tiros photographs and\neven more by the Gemini photographs, the Department of Interior\nsuggested an Earth resources satellite program in 1966. Early NASA\ninvestigation envisioned a small, low-altitude satellite in sunsynchronous orbit. What could be effectively measured with existing\nsensors, to what degree, with what frequency, in what priority? These\nquestions involved an increasing number of government agencies.\nThen there was the complex question of what trade-off was best\nbetween aircraft-borne sensors and satellite-borne ones . It was a new\nkind of program for NASA, involving many more government\nagencies and many more political sensitivities than the uncluttered\nresearches in space.\nThe advanced research activities of NASA also became more\nsubtle and difficult to track. An interlocking network of basic\nresearch and applied research, advanced research was designed to\nfeed new ideas and options into the planning process. The most\nvisible portion was flight research. The X-15 had culminated the\nseries of Air Force-NASA research aircraft with a glittering series of\nspeed and altitude records and a very solid base of aerodynamic data.\nThe prototype B-70 had been turned over to NASA for research in\nlarge aircraft flying at supersonic speeds.\nWhen the political question arose as to whether the United\nStates should enter the international competition for a supersonic\ncommercial transport aircraft-a sweepstakes already entered by\nGreat Britain and France jointly with their Concorde and by the\nSoviet Union with its TU-J44-NASA already had a solid data base\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA A D\n\nASA , 19 15- 1980\n\n63\n\nto contribute. It also had the laboratories and the contracting base to\nmanage the program. But wise counsel from Deputy Administrator\nDryden led to NASA\'s retreat into a supportive R&D role; he argued\nthat with Apollo under way, NASA could not politically sponsor\nanother high-technology, enormously expensive program in the\nsame budget years without one of them being sacrificed to the other\nor killing each other off in competition for funds. The subsequent\nhistory of the supersonic transport program, including its eventual\ndemise, was eloquent testimonial to the wisdom of his judgment. His\ndeath in December 1965 was a loss to the nation.\nAnother visible area of advanced research was the study of\nhydroplaning, the dangerous tendency of aircraft, when landing, to\nlose braking control on wet or slushy runways. Research done at\nLangley indicated that the wheels tended to float on top of the water\nsurface; grooving the concrete would drain water and provide much\ngreater traction. Quickly and successfully applied to runways, the\nsame technique soon spread to the national highway system.\nOther research efforts paid big dividends within the space\nprogram. Lewis Research Center had become involved in the use of\nliquid hydrogen as a rocket fuel in 1955. Although liquid hydrogen\noffered very attractive increases in thrust per kilogram as compared\nto previous fuels, hydrogen had a bad reputation left over from\ndirigible days and the Hindenburg disaster. But by 1957 Lewis was\nsuccessfully and routinely firing an 89-kilonewton-thrust engine\nusing liquid hydrogen as fuel. It was these tests that gave NASA the\nconfidence in 1959 to decide that the upper stages of the lunar rocket\nshould be fueled with liquid hydrogen. Without this additional\nrocket power, it might have been impossible- or at least much more\nexpensive- to put men on the moon.\nThe quiet-engine program for commercial aircraft grew out of\nwidespread public protest against noise levels around city airports.\nAgain Lewis was the lead center; laborious research into all aspects of\nthe jet engine (air inlets, turbine blades, exhaust characteristics) led\nto new possibilities that in combination would dramatically lower\nthe level of noise generated by jet aircraft.\nLong-range prospects of manned planetary exploration depended heavily on more efficient thrust-per-pound-of-fuel propulsion. To this end NASA had continued the long-range program inherited from the Air Force to develop a nuclear-propelled upper\nstage for a rocket. Engineering down to a compact package the\nenormous weight, size, and shielding of the kind of reactor used in\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n(\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nOn.3 February 1966 the AEC-NASA Nuclear Rocket Development Station atJackass\nFlats, Nevada, fired the first complete "breadboard" nuclear rocket engine to be tested by\nthe United States. It made two successful 1 5-minute test runs that day at partial power.\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nnuclear electric-power plants was a severe challenge. The inevitable\nintensification of radiation density and temperatures defeated existing materials that would contain and transmit the heat to an engine.\nTime after time over the years, test firings of promising configurations had to be stopped prematurely when radiation corrosion took\nits toll. Finally in December 1967 the NRX-A6 reactor ran for one\nhour at full power, twice the time achieved before. Improvements in\nreactor fuel elements cut radiation control in half. The Snap\nprogram of radioisotope thermoelectric generators also progressed.\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA A 0 NASA , 19 15- 1980\n\n65\n\nThe Snap-27 was the long-life power source for the Apollo science\nexperiments to be left on the lunar surface.\nThe flight-test program on lifting-body shapes for possible reentry configurations of future manned spacecraft got under way at\nFlight Research Center in 1964. The M-2 lifting body designed at\nAmes Research Center made 100 flights. Results indicated that a\nman could reenter the atmosphere and land safely on a runway in a\nlightweight lifting-body aircraft. Encouraged by the basic data,\nNASA ordered two more lifting bodies with different configurationsthe M-2/F-2 and the HL-I0. The M-2/F-2 made 15 successful flights\nin 1966-1967. The HL-10, after modification, made 13 flights in\n1968, 3 of them rocket powered.\nAlthough the tragic fire of January 1967 delayed plans for\nmanned spaceflight in Apollo hardware for something like 18\nmonths, the versatility of the system came to the rescue. The burden\nof checking out the major components of the system was quickly\nshifted to unmanned flights while a quick-opening hatch was\ndesigned and tested, combustibles were sought out and replaced,\nand the wiring design was completely reworked. After a nine-month\ndelay, flight tests resumed. On 9 November 1967 , Apollo 4 became\nthe first unmanned launch of the awesome Saturn V. A 110-meterhigh stack of three-stage launch vehicle and spacecraft, weighing\nThree lifting-body configurations grouped on the dry lake bed at Flight Research\nCenter-left to right, the X-24, M-2, and HL- JO.\n\n66\n\nI\nI\nI\ni\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nORD E RS OF MAG ITU DE\n\n2824 tons, slowly lifted off Launch Complex 39, propelled by a firststage thrust of 33800 kilonewtons. A record 126529 kilograms of\npayload and upper stage were put into Earth orbit. Later the third\nstage fired to simulate lunar trajectory, lifting the spacecraft combination to 17 335 kilometers. With the third stage discarded, the\nservice module fired its engine to raise the apogee to 18 204\nkilometers, then burned again to propel the spacecraft toward Earth\nreentry at the 40000-kilometer-per-hour return speed from the\nmoon. All systems performed well ; the third stage could restart in the\nvacuum of space; the automated Launch Complex 39 functioned\nbeautifully. The once-controversial concept of "all-up" testing had\nbeen vindicated.\nNext came the unmanned flight test of the laggard lunar module.\nOn 22 January 1968, a Saturn IB launched a 14 392-kilogram lunar\nmodule into Earth orbit. It separated, tested its ascent and descent\nengines. The lunar module passed its first flight test.\nNow to man-rate the huge Saturn V. Apollo 6, on 4 April 1968,\nput the launch vehicle through its paces-the stages, the guidance\nsystem, the electrical systems. Four of five test objectives were met;\nSaturn V was man-rated. The stage was set for the first manned spaceflight in Apollo since the tragic fire. Apollo 7 would test the crew and\ncommand module for the 10 days in space that would later be\nneeded to fly to the moon, land, and return .\nBut beyond Apollo 7, the schedule was in real difficulty. It was the\nsummer of 1968; only a year and a half remained of the decade\nwithin which this nation had committed itself to land m en on the\nmoon . Somehow the flight schedule ought to be accelerated.\nGemini\'s answer had been to launch missions closer together, but\nthe size and complexity of Apollo hardware severely limited that\noption . The only other possibility was to get more done on each\nflight. For a time, however, it seemed that th e next flight, Apollo 8,\nwould accomplish even less than had been planned. It had been\nscheduled as the first manned test of the lunar module in Earth orbit,\nbut the LM had a lengthy test-and-fix roadblock ahead of it and\ncould not be ready before the end of the year, and perhaps not then.\nSo a repeat of Apollo 7 was considered, another test of the command\nmodule in Earth orbit without the tardy LM but this time on the giant\nSaturn V. Eight years earlier that would have been considered a big\nbite; now, was it big enough, given Apollo\'s gargantuan task?\nIn Houston, George Low didn\'t think it was. After all, he reasoned, even this test-flight hardware was built to go to the moon; why\n\nA HISTORY OF\n\nACA A D NASA , 19 15- 1980\n\n67\n\nnot use it that way? The advantages of early experience at lunar\ndistances would be enormous. On 9 August he brqached the idea to\nGilruth, who was enthusiastic. Within days the senior managers of\nthe program had been polled and had checked for problems that\nmight inhibit a circumlunar flight. All problems proved to be\nfixab le, assuming that ApoLLo 7 went well. The trick then became to\nbuild enough flexibility into the Apollo 8 mission so that it could go\neither way, Earth-~rbital or lunar-orbital.\nApollo 7 was launched on 11 October 1968. A Saturn IB put three\nastronauts into Earth orbit, where they stayed for eleven days, testing\nparticularly the command module-environmental system, fuel\ncells, communications. All came through with flying colors. On 12\nNovember, NASA announced that Apollo 8 had been reconfigured to\nfocus on lunar orbit. It was a bold jump.\nOn 21 December a Saturn V lifted the manned Apollo 8 off\nLaunch Complex 39 at the Cape. The familiar phases were repeated:\nEarth orbit, circularizing the orbit, etc. But then the Saturn third\nstage fired again and added the speed necessary for the spacecraft to\nescape Earth\'s gravity on a trajectory to the moon. All the rehearsed\nor simulated steps went well. On 23 December the three-man crew\nbecame the first human beings to pass out of Earth\'s gravitational\ncontrol and into that of another body in the solar system. No longer\nwas man shackled to the near environs of Earth . The TV camera\nlooked back at a small, round, rapidly receding ball, warmly laced\nwith a mix of blue oceans, brown continents, and white clouds that\nwas startling against the blackness of space.\nOn Christmas Eve Apollo 8 disappeared behind the moon and\nout of radio communication with Earth. Not only were the astronauts\nthe first humans to see the mysterious back side of the moon; while\nthere they had to fire the service module engine to reduce their speed\nenough to be captured into lunar orbit-irrevocably, unless the\nengine would restart later and boost them back toward Earth.\nAnother engine burn regularized their lunar orbit at 113 kilometers above the surface. TV shared the breathtaking bird\'s-eye view\nof the battered lunar landscape with hundreds of millions on Earth.\nThe crew members read the creation story from Genesis and wished\nviewers a Merry Christmas. On Christmas Day they fired the service\nmodule engine once again, acquired the 1OOO-meter-per-second ad ditional speed needed to escape lunar gravity, and triumphantly\nheaded back to Earth. They had at close range verified the lunar\nlanding sites as feasible and proved out the hardware and com-\n\nAs Apollo 8 came around the backside ofthe moon after going into lunar orbit, the crew\nwas greeted with this haunting view ofthe earth rising above the desolate lunar horizon.\n\nmunications at lunar distance-except for the all-important last link,\nthe lunar module.\nThat last link, the lunar module, was still of major concern to\nNASA. Two more flights were expended to confirm its readiness for\nlunar landing. The Apollo 9 flight (3-13 March 1969) was the first\nmanned test of the lunar module. The big Saturn V boosted the\nspacecraft combination into Earth orbit. The lunar-flight drill was\ncarefully rehearsed; the command and service modules separated\nfrom the third stage of the Saturn V, turned around, and docked with\nthe lunar module. The lunar module fired up and moved away to\n183 kilometers; then the spacecraft rendezvoused and docked.\nA final test-was anything different at lunar distance? On 18\nMay 1969, Apollo 10 took off on a Saturn V to find out. The entire\n\nA HISTORY OF , ACA AND NASA , 191 5- 1980\n\n69\n\nlunar landing combination blasted out to lunar distance. Once in\nlunar orbit, the crew separated the lunar module from the command\nmodule, descended to within 14 kilometers of the surface, fired the\nascent system, and docked with the command module. Now all\nsystems were "gO."\nOn 16 July 1969, ApoLLo 11 lifted off for the ultimate mission of\nApollo. Saturn V performed beautifully. The spacecraft combination got off to the moon.

On 20 July the LM\nseparated and descended to the lunar surface. At 4: 18 p.m. (EST)\ncame the word from Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong: " HoustonTranquility Base here-the Eagle has landed." After checkout,\nArmstrong set foot on the lunar surface-"one small step for a\nman -one giant leap for mankind. " The eight-year national commitment had been fulfilled; man was on the moon. Armstrong set up the\nTV camera and watched his fellow astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr.,\njoin him on the lunar surface, as Michael Collins circled the moon in\nthe Columbia command module overhead. More than one-fifth of the\nearth\'s population watched ghostly TV pictures of two space-suited\nmen plodding around gingerly in an unlikely world of gray surface,\nboulders, and rounded hills in the background. The astronauts implanted the U.S . flag, deployed the scientific experiments to be left\non the moon, collected their rock samples, and clambered back into\nthe lunar module. The next day they blasted off in the ascent module\nand rendezvoused with the command module.\nThe astronauts returned to an ecstatic reception. For a brief\nmoment, man\'s day-to-day divisions had been suspended; the world\nwatched and took joint pride in man\'s latest achievement in exploration. Astronauts and their families made a triumphant world tour\nwhich restated mankind\'s pride in this new plateau of man\'s\nconquest of the cosmos.\n\nI\n\n--~\n\n4\n\nExploitation of Apollo\nThe worldwide euphoria over mankind\'s greatest voyage of exploration did not rescue the NASA budget. At its moment of greatest triumph, the space program was being drastically cut back from\nthe $5-billion budgets that had characterized the mid-1960s. Part of\nthe reduction was expected; the peak of Apollo production-line\nexpenses was past. But the depth of the cut stemmed from emotional changes in the political climate, mosdy centering on the unpopular\nVietnam war-its sapping expenses in lives and money, the debilitating protests at home. As Congress read the public pulse, the cosmos\ncould wait; the Soviet threat had for the moment been put to rest; the\nnew political reality lay in domestic problems. NASA\'s fiscal 1970\nbudget was reduced to $3.7 billion. Something had to give. The basic\nApollo mission was continued, but the last three flights had to be\ndeleted. Space science projections were hit hard. The ambitious $2billion Voyager program for planetary exploration dwindled into\noblivion; it would later resurface as the much more modest Viking.\nThe new Electronics Research Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\nunder construction since 1964, was sacrificed -transferred to the\nDepartment of Transportation intact, a $40-million facility and 399\nof 745 skilled employees.\nBut the bought-and-paid-for projects continued to earn dividends. An Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO 2) was launched\n7 December 1968. It was the heaviest and most complex automated\nspacecraft yet in the space science program. It took the first ultraviolet photographs of the stars. The results were portentous: first hard\nevidence of the existence of "black holes" in space. Manner 6 and 7,\nlaunched in early 1969,journeyed to Mars, flew past as close as 3200\nkilometers, took 198 high-quality TV photos of the planet, 2000\nultraviolet spectra, and 400 infrared spectra of the atmosphere and\nsurface.\nOther programs continued with prepaid momentum. The fifth\nand sixth Orbiting Solar Observatories were launched in 1969, as\n71\n\nOAO 2, the orbiting astronomical obseroatory, was the largest, heaviest, and most\ncomplex scientifu spacecraft NASA had developed. With its solar panels deployed, as\nshown here, OAO 2 was 6.4 meters wide, weighed 2000 kilograms, and carried 11\nultraviolet telescopes into space.\n\nwas the sixth Orbiting Geophysical Observatory. The supercritical\nwing, product of four years of wind-tunnel research by Richard T.\nWhitcomb at Langley, was committed to fabrication for test at Flight\nResearch Center. The flight tests confirmed the theoretical data; the\ncurrent generation of transport aircraft could fly up to 160 kilometers\nper hour faster, promising significant operating economies.\n1970 saw the launch of UhUTU, which scanned 95% of the celestial sphere for sources of x-rays. It discovered three new pulsar stars\nin addition to the one previously identified. In 1971 Mariner 9 was\nlaunched; on 10 November, the first American spacecraft went into\norbit around another planet. The early months in orbit were discouraging; a gigantic dust storm covered most of the Martian surface for\ntwo months. But the dust gradually cleared; photographs in 1972\nshowed startling detail. Mapping 85% of the Martian surface, Mariner 9\nphotographs depicted higher mountains and deeper valleys than any\non Earth. The rocky Martian moons, Deimos and Phobos, were also\nphotographed. OSO 7, launched on 29 September 1971, was the first\nsatellite to catch on film the beginning of a solar flare and the consequent streamers of hot gases that extended out 10.6 million kilometers; it would also discover " polar ice caps" on the sun - dark\nareas several million degrees cooler than the normal surface temper-\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA A 0\n\nASA, 1915- 1980\n\n73\n\natures. With the confirmation of black holes, the enigmatic collapsed\nstar remnants so dense in mass and gravity that even light cannot\nescape, and the previous discoveries of quasars and pulsars, these\nfindings added up to the most exciting decade in modern astronomy.\nPlanetary exploration opened further vistas of other worlds .\nPioneer 10, launched 2 March 1972, left the vicinity of Earth at the\nhighest velocity ever achieved by a spacecraft (5 1 200 kilometers per\nhour) and took off on an epic voyage to the huge, misty planet\nJupiter. Giant of the solar system, swathed with clouds, encircled by a\ncluster of moons, Jupiter was an inescapable target if one hoped to\nunderstand the composition of the solar system. Out from the sun,\nout from Earth, Pioneer 10 ventured for a year and a half, through the\nunexplored Asteroid Belt and far beyond. After a 992-millionkilometer journey, on 3 December 1973 the tiny spacecraft flew past\nJupiter. It survived the fierce magnetic field and sent back photographs of the huge planet and several of its moons, measured temperatures and radiation and the magnetic field. Steadily sailing past\nAs the great dust storm on Mars cleared, the circling Mariner 9 photographed this giant\nmountain.

On 3 December 1974 it passedJupiter at the\nperilously close distance of 42 000 kilometers-as \'opposed to\n129000 kilometers for Pioneer 1O-and returned data. The composite\npicture from the reports of the two spacecraft depicted an enormous\nball of hydrogen, with no fixed surface, emitting much more\nradiation than it received from the sun, shrouded with a turbulent\natmosphere in which massive storms such as the Great Red Spot\n(40000 kilometers in length) had raged for at least the 400 years since\nGalileo first trained a telescope atJupiter. Pioneer 11 swung around\nthe planet and, taking advantage of Jupiter\'s gravitational field, accelerated outward at 106 000 kilometers per hour toward the distant\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA A D\n\nASA , 191 5- 1980\n\n75\n\nplanet Saturn, where in 1979 it would observe at close range this\nlightest of the planets (it could float on water), its mysterious rings,\nand its 4800-kilometer-diameter moon Titan.\nGoing in the other direction, Mariner 10 left Earth on 3 November 1973, headed inward toward the sun. In February 1974 it passed\nVenus, gathering information that confirmed the inhospitable\ncharacter of that planet. Then, using Venus\'s gravitational force as\npropulsion, it charged on toward the innermost planet, Mercury. On\n29 March 1974, Mariner 10 flew past Mercury, providing man a 5000times closer look at this desolate, crater-pocked, sun-seared planet\nthan had been possi ble from Earth. Using the gravitational field of its\nVenus was photographed from 720000 kilometers by Mariner 10.\n\nA large, .fresh impact crater on Mercury was photographed by Mariner 10.from 34 000\nkiLometers.

The cumulative evidence\npictured a planet essentially unchanged since its creation some 4.5\nbillion years ago, except for heavy bombardment by meteors, with\nan iron core similar to Earth\'s, a thin atmosphere composed mostly\nof helium, and a weak magnetic field.\nFascinating as was the information on our fellow-voyagers in the\nsolar system and as important as the long-range scientific import\nmight be, Congress and many government agencies were much\nmore intrigued with the tangible, immediate-return, Earth-oriented\nprogram that began operations in 1972. On 23 July ERTS 1 (Earth\nResources Technology Satellite) was launched into polar orbit. From\nthat orbit it would cover three-quarters of the earth\'s land surface\nevery 18 days, at the same time of day (and therefore with the same\nsun angle for photography), affording virtually global real-time\ninformation on developing events such as crop inventory and health,\nwater storage, air and water pollution, forest fires and diseases, and\n\nL\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA A\n\n0 NASA , 19 15- 1980\n\n77\n\nrecent urban population changes . In addition it depicted the broadarea- and therefore undetectable by ground surveyor aircraft\nreconnaissance-geologic patterns and coastal and oceanic movements. ERTS 1 also interrogated hundreds of ground sensors\nmonitoring air and water pollution, water temperature and currents,\nsnow depth, etc., and relayed information to central collection\ncenters in near real-time. The response was instantaneous and\nwidespread; foreign governments, states, local governments, universities, and a broad range of industrial concerns quickly became\ninvolved in both the exploration of techniques to exploit these new\n\nERTS (Earth Resources Technology Satellite) photograph ofthe Washington-Baltimore\narea in October 19 72.

Some 300 national and\ninternational research teams pored over the imagery. For the first\ntime accurate estimates were possible of the total planting and\ngrowth status of wheat, barley, corn, and rice crops at various times\nduring the growing season; real-time maps versus ones based on data\nthat would have been collected over a period of years; timber cutting\npatterns; accurate prediction of snow run-offforwater management;\naccurate, real-time flood damage reports. Mid-term data included\nindications that the encroachments of the Sahara Desert in Africa\ncould be reversed by controlled grazing on the sparse vegetation in\nthe fringe areas; longer range returns suggested promise in monitoring strip mining and subsequent reclamation and in identification of\npreviously unknown extensions of Earth faults and fractures important to detection of potential earthquake zones and of associated\nmineral deposits.\nLike the experimental communications satellites of the early\n1960s, the Earth-resources satellites found an immediate clientele of\ngovernmental and commercial customers clamoring for a continuing inflow of data. The pressure made itselffelt in Congress; on 22January 1975, Landsat 2 (formerly ERTS 2) was orbited ahead of schedule\nto ensure continuation of the data that ERTS I (renamed Landsat 1)\nhad provided for two and a half years, and a third satellite was\nprogrammed for launch in 1977. This would give confidence to\nexperimental users of the new system that they could securely plan\nfor continued information from the satellite system.\nThe Earth-resources program had another important meaning.\nIt was a visible sign that the nature and objectives of the space\nprogram were undergoing a quiet but dramatic shift. Where the\nmoon had been the big target during the 1960s and large and\nexpensive programs had been the name of the game, it became\nincreasingly clear to NASA management as the decade ended that\nthe political climate would no longer support that kind of a space\nprogram. The key question now was, "What will this project contribute to solving everyday problems of the man-in-the-street?" One by\none the 60s-type daydreams of big, away-from-Earth projects were\nreluctantly put aside: a manned lunar base, a manned landing on\nMars, an unmanned "Grand Tour" of several of the planets. When\nthe Space Shuttle finally won approval, it was because of its heavy\ndedication to studies of our Earth and its convincing economies in\noperation.\nAnother sign of the times was that NASA was increasingly\n\nA HISTORY OF\n\nACA A D NASA, 191 5- 1980\n\n79\n\nbecoming a service agency. In 1970 NASA for the first time launched\nmore satellites for others (ComSatCorp, NOAA, DoD, foreign\ngovernments) than for itself. Five years before only 20f24 launches\nhad been for others. Clearly this trend would continue for some years.\nMeanwhile Apollo was running its impressive course. Apollo 12\n(14-24 November 1969) repeated the ApoLLo 11 adventure at another\nsite on the moon, the Ocean of Storms. One attraction of that site was\nthat Surveyor 3 had been squatting there for two and a half years . A\npin-point landing put the LM within 183 meters of the Surveyor\nspacecraft. In addition to deploying scientific instruments and\ncollecting rock samples from the immediate surroundings, Astronauts\nConrad and Bean cut off pieces from Surveyor 3, including the TV\ncamera, for return to Earth and analysis after 30 months of exposure\nto the lunar environment.\nApollo 13 was launched 11 April 1970, to continue lunar exploration. But 56 hours into the flight, well on the way to the moon, there\nwas a thump back in the service module behind the astronauts. An\noxygen tank had ruptured. Pressure dropped alarmingly. What was\nthe total damage? Had other systems been affected? How crippled\nwas the spacecraft combination? The backup analysis system on\nEarth sprang into action . Using the meager data available, crews at\ncontractor plants allover the country simulated, calculated, and\nreported. The verdict: Apollo 13 was seriously, perhaps mortally,\nwounded. There was not air or water or electricity to sustain three\nmen on the shortest possible return path to Earth. But, ground crews\nand astronauts asked simultaneously, what about the lunar module,\na self-contained spacecraft unaffected by the disaster? The lunar\nlanding was out of the question anyway; the lifesaving question was\nhow to get three men around the moon and back to Earth before\ntheir life-supporting consumables ran out. Could the LM substitute\nfor the command module, supplying propulsion and oxygen and\nwater for an austere return trip? The simulations said yes. Apollo 13\nwas reprogrammed to loop around the moon and set an emergency\ncourse for Earth return. The descent engine for the LM responded\nnobly; off they went back to Earth. It was a near thing- powered\ndown to the point of minimum heating and communication,\nlimiting activity to the least possible to save oxygen. Again the\nflexibility and depth of the system came to the rescue; when reentry\nwas safely within the limited capabilities of the crippled Apollo, the\n"lifeboat" LM was fondly jettisoned along with the wounded service\nmodule. Apollo 13 reentered safely.\nThe next flight was delayed while the causes and fixes for the\n\nL\n\n80\n\nORDERS OF MAG\n\n[TU D E\n\nnear-tragedy on Apollo 13 were soned out. On 3 1January 1971, Apollo 14\nlifted off, the beginning of the scientific exploration of the moon.\nThe major new system was a transporter, a cart on which to load\nequipment and bring back rock samples. A major target of the Apollo\n14 mission to Fra Mauro was to climb the walls of the Cone Crater;\nthe attempt failed near the top when the walls turned out to be\nsteeper than anticipated.\nApollo 15 introduced the moon car, the lunar rover. With this\nele.c tric-powered, four-wheel drive vehicle developed at Marshall at a\ncost of $60 million, the astronauts roamed beyond the narrow\nconfines of their landing site and explored the area. Astronauts on\nthis flight covered 28 kilometers oflunar surface, visited a number of\ncraters in the Hadley-Apennines area, and photographed the ghostly\nravine Hadley Rille. Thanks to the lowered exertion level because of\nthe lunar rover, exploration time was doubled.\nThe remaining Apollo missions now had all the equipment\n\nApollo 15 AstroMut David R.

ApoLLo 17, launched 7 December 1972, ended\nthe Apollo program with the most productive scientific mission of\nthe lunar exploration program. The site, Taurus-Littrow, had been\nselected on the basis of previous flights. Objectives were to seek out\nboth oldest and youngest rocks to fill in the geologic history of the\nmoon. For the first time a trained geologist, Harrison H. Schmitt,\nwas on a crew, adding his professional observations.

From beginning to end, it had lasted 11 ~\nyears, cost $23.5 billion, landed 12 men on the moon, and produced\nan unassessable amount of evidence and knowledge. Technologically\nit had produced hardware systems several orders of magnitude more\ncapable than their predecessors. In various combinations, the\ncomponents of this technology could be used for a wider variety of\nexplorations than the nation could possibly afford. The luxury of\nchoice was, which of a half dozen possible missions?\nScientific answers were going to be returned over several\ndecades. The Lunar Receiving Laboratory had been constructed in\nHouston to be the "archive" of the 382 kilograms of physical lunar\nsamples that had been returned from various parts of the moon by\nsix lunar-landing crews. Scientists in this country and 54 foreign\ncountries were analyzing the samples with an impressive variety of\ninstruments and the expertise of many scientific disciplines. Gross\nresults had already established that the moon was a separate entity\nfrom Earth, formed at the same time as Earth some 4.5 billion years\nago; that it had its own volcanic history; that with no protective\natmosphere it had been bombarded by eons of meteors from outer\nspace, which had plowed up the surface and in larger impacts had\ntriggered secondary lava flows from the lunar interior. Refinement of\ndata would go on for decades.\nApollo had proved many other things: the ability of our diversified system of government, industry, and universities to mobilize\nbehind a common national purpose and produce on schedule an\nimmense and diverse system directed to a common purpose. It not\nonly argued that man could do many things in space, whether\nextended lunar exploration from permanent lunar bases or manned\nexcursions to Mars, but argued that solutions to many of man\'s\nmajor problems on Earth-pollution, food supply, natural disasters\nsuch as earthquakes and hurricanes, etc.-could be ameliorated or\n\n82\n\nORDERS O F MAC ITUDE\n\ncontrolled by the combination of space technology and the largescale management techniques applied to it.\nNext in manned spaceflight carne SLylab. Trimmed back to one\norbital wDrkshop and three astronaut flights, Skylab had had a hectic\nfinancial and planning career, the converse of Apollo . The revised\nplan called for an S-IVB stage of the Saturn V to be outfitted as a twostory orbiting laboratory, one floor being living quarters and the\nother working room . The major objective of Skylab was to determine\nwhether men could physically withstand extended stays in space and\ncontinue to do useful work. Medical data from the Gemini and\nApollo flights had not completely answered the question. Since there\nwould be far more room in the 27 -meter-long orbital workshop than\nin any previous spacecraft, William C. Schneider, Skylab program\ndirector, devised a more extensive experiment schedule than all\nprevious spaceflights combined. Most ambitious in terms of hardware was the Apollo telescope mount; five major experiments would\ncover the entire range of solar physics and make it the most powerful\nastronomical observatory ever put in orbit. The other major areas of\nexperimentation were Earth-resources observations and medical\nexperiments involving the three-man crew. There were important\nsubcategories of experiments: the electric furnace, for example,\nwould explore possibilities of using the weightless environment to\nperform industrial processes that were impossible or less effective on\nI-g Earth, such as forming perfectly round ball bearings or growing\nlarger crystals, much in demand in the electronics industry.\nOn 14 May 1973 a giant Saturn V lifted off from Kennedy Space\nCenter to place the unmdJlned 7491 O-kilogram orbital workshop in\nEarth orbit. Within minutes after launch, disquieting news filtered\nthrough the telemetry reports from the Saturn V. The large, delicate\nmeteoroid shade on the outside of the workshop had apparently\nbeen torn offby the vibrations oflaunch. In tearing offit had caused\nserious damage to the two wings of solar cells that were to supply\nmost of the electric power to the workshop; one of them had sheared\noff, the other was snagged in the folded position. Once the workshop\nwas in orbit, the news worsened. The loss of the big shade exposed\nthe metal skin of the wGrkshop to the hot sunshine; internal\ntemperatures soared to 325 K. This heat not only threatened its\nhabitation by astronauts, but if prolonged might fog sensitive film\nand generate poisonous gases.\nThe launch of the first crew was twice postponed, while the farflung ground support team worked around the clock for 10 frantic\n\nMission accomplished, the Skylab orbital worksfwp sails serenely above cloud-shrouded\nEarth in this pfwto taken by the last crew as they leave to return to Earth.

With only partial knowledge of the precise degree and\nnature of the damage, engineers had to work out fixes that met the\nknown problems, yet were versatile enough to cope with unknown\nones . There were two major efforts: first, to devise a deployable\nshade that the astronauts could spread over the metal surface of the\nworkshop; the other was to devise a versatile tool kit of cutters and\nsnippers to release the undeployed solar wing from whatever\nprevented it from unfolding.\nOn 25 May 1973, an Apollo command and service module\ncombination was lifted into orbit by a Saturn lB. Apollo docked with\nthe workshop on the 25th. The crew entered it the next day and\ndeployed a makeshift parasol through the solar airlock. The effect\nwas immediate; internal temperature began to drop. On 7 June\nAstronauts Conrad and Kerwin clambered outside the workshop\nand after a tense struggle succeeded in cutting the metal straps that\nensnared the remaining solar wing; it slowly deployed and electrical\npower poured into the storage batteries. Human ingenuity and\ncourage had made the workshop operational again.\nThe remaining Skylab missions were almost anticlimactic after\nthe.dramatic rescue of the workshop. With only minor problems, the\nmissions ticked off their complicated schedules of experiment. In\nspite of the initial diversion, the first crew obtained 80% of the solar\ndata planned; 12 of 15 Earth-resources runs were completed; and all\n\nThis color-density rendition oja solar eruption was taken by Skylab\'s spectroheliograph.\nOne ojthe 10 kinds ojtelescope in the Apollo telescope mount, it covered the wavelengths\nin the extreme ultraviolet, a part oj the spectrum never seen from Earth.\n\nof the 16 medical experiments went as planned.

All the medical\nexperiments were performed. The third crew (launched 16 November 1973) completed an 84-day flight with all experiments performed,\nas well as the additional observations of the surprise cosmic visitor,\ncomet Kohoutek.\nThe vast mass of astronomical and Earth-resources data from\nthe Skylab program would take years to analyze. A more immediate\nresult was apparent in the medical data and the industrial experiments.\nWith the corrective exercises available on Skylab, there was no\nphysiological barrier to the length of time man could survive and\nfunction in space. Man\'s biological functions did indeed stabilize\nafter several weeks in zero-g. The industrial experiments gave strong\nevidence that the melting and solidification process was promisingly\ndifferent in weightlessness; single crystals grew five times as large as\nthose producible on Earth . Some high-cost industrial processes\napparently had new potential in space.\n\n--\n\n~~\n\n--\n\n-\n\n~~ ---\n\n- --- - - -\n\n--\'\n\n5\nOn the Eve of Shuttle\nWhile Skylab was being built, other events significant to the\nfuture of space exploration were taking place. The initiatives bore the\nimprint of Thomas O. Paine, acting administrator after Webb\'s\nresignation in 1968 and administrator of NASA from March 1969\nuntil he returned to industry in September 1970. One was a broad\napproach to increased cooperation in space exploration. As had so\nmany of our international space initiatives in the postwar period,\nthis effort offered separate proposals to the Soviet Union and to\nWestern European countries. The approach to the Soviet Union\nbegan in 1968, with suggestions for advanced cooperation, especially\nin the expensive arena of manned spaceflight. One area of Soviet\nvulnerability might be rescue of astronauts and cosmonauts. By now\nthe Soviet Union had lost four cosmonauts in flight, three in one\naccident, one in another. They had always evidenced a singular\nconcern for cosmonaut safety. Perhaps some joint program co uld\ndevelop a system of international space rescue. The dynamics\nseemed right; by 1969 the evidence was clear that, whether the Soviet\nUnion had in fact been in a moon-landing race with the United\nStates, the United States was ahead. Secrecy in space was virtually\nnonexistent; size of payloads, destinations of missions, performance-all were detectable by tracking systems.\nPaine\'s first offer was for Soviet linkup with the Skylab orbital\nworkshop. But the very hardware implied inequity. The Soviets were\nnot interested . Further explorations found lively Soviet interest in a\ncompletely new project to develop compatible docking and rescue\nsystems for manned spaceflight. Negotiations proceeded rapidly.\nCompleted by George M. Low, acting administrator after Paine\'s\ndeparture, the grand plan for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP)\ncalled for a mutual docking and crew exchange mission that could\ndevelop the necessary equipment for international rescue and\nestablish such criteria for future manned systems from both nations.\nA Soyuz spacecraft would lift off from the Soviet Union and establish\nitself in orbit. Then an Apollo spacecraft would be launched to\n85\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n86\n\nORDER\n\nOF MAG ITUDE\n\nrendezvous and dock with the Soviet craft. Using a specially\ndeveloped docking unit between the two spacecraft, they would\nadjust pressurization differences of the two spacecraft and spend twO\ndays docked together, exchanging crews and conducting experiments.\nAll of this was agreed to and rapidly became a significant test for the\nvalidity of the detente agreements which President Richard M.\nNixon had negotiated with the Soviet Union.\nAn unprecedented detailed cooperation between the two superpowers ensued. A series of joint working groups of Soviet and\nAmerican specialists met over several years to work out the various\nhardware details and operational procedures. At the Nixon-Brezhnev\nsummit in 1973, the prospective launch date was narrowed to July\n1975. The most concrete example of U.S.-USSR cooperation in\nspace proceeded with good faith on both sides. The mission flew as\nscheduled on 15 July and smoothly fulfilled all objectives.\nThe other major initiative of Paine\'s began on the domestic\nfront and then expanded to the international front. Skylab having\nbeen narrowed to the point that it would be a limited answer to the\nfuture of manned spaceflight, President ixon appointed a task\ngroup to recommend broad outlines for the next 10 years of space\nASTP (Apollo-Soyuz Test Project) hardware on view at the Paris A irshow in May 197J.\nThe Apollo command and service modules are on the left, Soyuz on the right; the darker\ncylinder between them is the newly designed docking module.\n\nL _\n\n_\n\nA HISTORY OF\n\nACA AND NASA , 19 15- 198 0\n\n87\n\nexploration . Within this group, chaired by Vice President Spiro T.\nAgnew, Paine won acceptance forthe conceprofthe Space Shuttle. In\nits original conception, the Space Shuttle would have been a rocketboosted airplane-like structure that would take off from a regular\nairport runway, fly to orbital speed and altitude, deploy satellites into\norbit, repair or retrieve satellites already in orbit, and, using an\nadditional Space Tug stage, lift manned and unmann d payloads\nthroughout the solar system. Compared to earlier methods, the big\nchanges would be that the launcher and Shuttle would be reusable\nfor up to 100 flights, halving the cost per pound in orbit. But\nsubsidiary changes were only slightly less important: satellites could\nbe designed for orbital rigors, not the additional ones of rocket\nlaunch . In a manned mission, the Shuttle could handle up to a sevenman crew in orbit; three of these could be non-pilot scientists who\nwent along to operate their experiments in an unpressurized\nlaboratory carried in the Shuttle cargo bay. The flight crew alone\ncould deliver 29500 kilograms of assorted satellites into orbit and\ncould land on Earth with a returning payload of 14500 kilograms.\nThe task group submitted its repon to the president on 15\nSeptember 1969. It offered three levels of effort: option I would\nfeature a lunar-orbital station, an Earth-orbital station, and a lunar\nsurface base in the 1980s; option 2 envisioned a Mars manned\nmission in 1986; option 3 included initial development of space\nstation and reusable shuttles but would defer landing on Mars. until\nsome time before the end of the century . Eventual peak expenditures on these options were estimated to vary from $10 billion down\nto $5 billion per year. Study and rework went on for more than two\nyears. Paine left NASA to return to industry; his successor, James C.\nFletcher, took office in April 1971 and immediately reviewed the\nstatus of the Space Shuttle, particularly for its political salability. He\nbecame quickly convinced that the Shuttle as then envisioned was\ntoo costly to win approval. Total costs for its development were\nestimated at $10.5 billion. Fletcher instigated a rigorous restudy and\nredesign which cut the cost in half, mainly by dropping the plan for\nunassisted takeoff and substituting two external, recoverable, reusable solid rockets and an expendable external fuel tank. This proved\nto be salable; President Nixon approved the development of the\nSpace Shuttle on 5 January 1972.\nFirst Paine and then Fletcher had been trying to get a commitment for a major system in the Shuttle from Western European\nnations. Their own joint space program had not been an unqualified\n\n88\n\nORDERS OF MAG\n\nITUDE\n\nsuccess. Western European nations had joined to form two international space organizations, ELDO to produce launch vehicles and\nESRO to produce spacecraft and collect and interpret results . The\ntechnical capability was there, but political liabilities constantly\nplagued and disrupted -who paid how much of what, which nations\ngot which contracts, etc.? The boosters had three stages, each\ndeveloped in a different country. The launch record was a gloomy\nhistory of one kind of failure after another. After years of effort,\nWestern Europe had little to show for its independent space\nprogram. A new start was in the air. It was into this restive\nenvironment that Paine came to talk about the next generation of the\nU.S . space program and to hold out promise of some discrete major\nsegment to be developed and produced in Europe-a partnership\nthat would give them a meaningful piece of the action with full pride\nof useful participation. Europe\'s response was warm, though it took\na while to coalesce. Finally the joint decision was made: Western\nEurope would build the self-contained Spacelab that would fit in the\ncargo bay of the Shuttle spacecraft; a pressurized module would provide a shirtsleeve environment for scientists to operate large-scale\nunpressurized scientific instrument pallet would\nexperiments;\ngive large telescopes and other instruments direct access to the space\nenvironment. The cost, an estimated $370 million. In 1975 Canada\njoined the international effort, agreeing to foot the $30-million\nresearch and development bill for the remote manipulator that will\nbe used to emplace and retrieve satellites in orbit.\nThe Space Shuttle promised a whole new way of spaceflight:\nnonpilots in space; multiple payloads that could be placed where\nthey were wanted or picked up out of orbit; new designs of satellites,\nfree from the expensive safeguards against the vibrations and shocks\nof launch by rocket. The $5.2-billion program would buy two\nprototypes for test in 1978 and 1979. Projected flight programs from\n1980 to 1991 identified a total of almost a thousand payloads to be\nhandled by the Shuttle. True space transportation was in the offing.\nIn space science the big program was Viking, which represented\nthe first major fruit of a decision NASA had made some years before:\nto focus the space science program on the planets. Apollo, the\nreasoning went, would keep scientists busy for years analyzing the\nmass of data and samples that had been returned from the moon.\nNot until that information had been assimilated would there be a\nneed to consider whether more information was needed from the\nmoon and, if so, what kind .\nMeanwhile space science, while not neglecting the study of the\n\nan\n\n__ J\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA AND NASA , 191 5- 1980\n\n89\n\nsun and the universe, would concentrate on the inner planets of our\nsolar system and begin an assault on the enigmatic outer planets.\nApollo had shown, and the early planetary flights had confirmed,\nthat every celestial body has worthwhile lessons to teach-lessons\nthat are important in their own right as science as well as lessons that\nilluminate problems on Earth. Why does Earth have the kinds and\nproportions of minerals that it has? Why tectonic plates and\nvolcanism? Why oceans and the kind of atmosphere it has ? Why does\nour atmosphere circulate and transfer heat the way it does? Every\nnew body we study represents a new laboratory and a different data\nset.\nSo it was that Mars, the most likely of the inner planets, became\nthe first target of the more ambitious planetary program . In two\nlaunches the Viking program proposed to dep loy four spacecraft in\nthe vicinity of Mars; two orbiters would photograph the surface and\nserve as communications relays, while two landers would descend to\nthe Martian surface and photograph the terrain, measure and\nmonitor the atmosphere and climate, and conduct chemical and\nbiological tests on the soil for evidence of rudimentary life forms. It\nwas very ambitious technology and complex science to be operated\nfrom 65000000 kilometers distance. But perform Viking did, in a\ntechnological triumph equal to-and in some ways greater than the Apollo landings on the moon. Arriving in the vicinity of Mars in\nmid-1976, the spacecraft went into orbit around the planet. Subsequently the two landers arced down to the rock-strewn surface where\neach landed safely. The twO orbiters circled the planet, mapping\nmost of the surface. That surface depicted by the orbiters, plus the\nweather and seismic reports from the landers, told a story of a planet\nwith a quiescent present but a very different, active past. Volcanoes\nhalf again as high as any on Earth and great eroded canyo ns deeper\nand longer than any on Earth spoke of times, probably three billion\nyears ago, when Mars was very active volcan.ically, with widespread\nliquid flows. Trace gases in the present thin atmosphere indicate a\nmuch denser atmosphere in the past. There is water, frozen in the\npolar ice caps; there are occasional dust storms; there are seasonal as\nwell as diurnal variations in temperature; there is only a trace of\nseismic activity now. Viking\'s elaborate biology instruments detected\nno evidence of life forms. When the intensive one-year study of the\nplanet ended, the spacecraft continued observations and reporting at\nintervals, providing further data on surface features, climate, and\nweather.\nEarth\'s nearest planetary neighbor, Venus, was also probed\n\nI\n\n.\n\nViking orbiter montage oj 102 pfwtos oj\nMars in February 1980 (left) sfwws the\nValles Marineris bisecting the planet, a\ngorge that would stretch from coast to coast\nof North America; to its left, three large\nvolcanoes poke up through the unusual\ncloud cover.

Two Pioneer spacecraft were\nlaunched toward Venus in the summer of 1978. Studying Venus\npresents a notably different problem than Mars or Earth. Its thick,\nheavy, hot atmosphere is impervious to normal photography and\ncan be "seen" through only by means of radar. The first spacecraft\narriving at Venus in December 1978, therefore, was an orbiter\nequipped with mapping radar to delineate the major features on the\nsurface. The second spacecraft was a bus which released four probes\nin a broad pattern; these parachuted slowly through the atmosphere,\nsending back measurements until they crashed. The Venusian\natmosphere, they reported, is remarkably similar in composition\nand temperature on the day and night sides. There is a heavy sulfur\ncontent, with oxygen and water vapor at lower levels. By 1980 the\norbiter had mapped over 80% of the Venusian surface. Major\nfeatures resemble two continents and a massive island chain-except\nthere is no ocean. Instead a rolling plain envelops the planet. One\ncontinent and the island chain are in the northern hemisphere. The\ncontinent is the size of Australia and has mountains taller than\nEverest; the island chain is apparently composed of two massive\nshield volcanoes more extensive than the Hawaii-Midway complex.\nThe continent in the southern hemisphere is about half the size of\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA A 0\n\nASA , 19 15- 1980\n\n91\n\nAfrica and exposes the lowest elevations on Venus in the Great Rift\nValley, a huge trench 280 kilometers wide and 2250 long, with a\ndepth similar to that of the great rift on Mars.\nStudy of the outer planets using more sophisticated spacecraft\nbegan in 1977 with the launch of Voyager 1 and 2 on 18-month flights\nto Jupiter. The Voyager system, Science magazine reported, was\nimproved "by a factor of 150,000 times" over the Mariner 4 system,\nwhich flew to Mars in 1965. Voyager 1 made its closest approach to\nJupiter in March 1979, with Voyager 2 following in July. The sensors\nrecorded in fine-grain detail the intricate weather patterns on\nJupiter and detected massive lightning bolts in the cloud tops. Passes\nby the Galilean moons revealed startling differences: active volcanoes\non 10, ancient rings on Callisto marking the edges of huge impact\ncraters, Europa\'s surface laced with cracks from crustal movement,\nand Ganymede with a varying grooved and cratered surface.\nWith a boost from Jupiter\'s gravitational field, the Voyagers set\ncourse for distant, beringed Saturn, where Voyager 1 arrived in\nNovember 1980. Voyager 2 was scheduled to arrive in August 1981,\nafter which, if sufficient control gas remains, the mission may be\nextended to far-away Uranus. The venerable Pioneer 11 had visited\nSaturn in September 1979, discovering faint rings outside those\ndiscernible from Earth and demonstrating a safe flight path for\nVoyager 2 to follow, if it goes on to Uranus.\n.\nIn the study of the sun and its interrelationships with Earth,\nNASA continued analysis of the mass of data acquired by Skylab\'s\nApollo telescope mount. OSO 8, launched in 1975 to make a detailed\nstudy of the minimum phase of the II-year solar cycle, returned data\nuntil 1978. HeLios 2, part of ajoint program with the Federal Republic\nof Germany to study the basic solar processes, was launched in 1976.\nAs the solar cycle moved toward its maximum phase, the Solar\nMaximum Mission was launched in 1980 to study solar flares in the\nwavelengths in which the sun releases most of its energy.\nTo study the effects of solar radiation on Earth \'s magnetosphere\nand atmosphere, NASA launched InternationaL Sun-Earth ExpLorer 1\nand 2 in 1977. Positioned some distance apart but in similar elliptical\norbits, the two satellites (one provided by NASA, the other by the\nEuropean Space Agency) monitored the complex interactions of\nEarth\'s magnetosphere with incoming solar radiation. In 1978 ISEE\n3 was added to the system. Positioned much farther out from Earth,\nthe spacecraft receives the solar wind and flares about an hour\nearlier, when they are unaffected by the magnetosphere.\n\nVoyager I and 2 photographs ofjupiter and its moon 10.

HEAO 2, following the next year, studied in detail the most\npromising of those sources. HEAO 3, launched in 1979, surveyed the\nsky for gamma-ray sources and cosmic-ray flux. The other satellite\norbited for study of the universe was the International Ultraviolet\nExplorer. Carrying instruments from NASA, the United Kingdom,\nand the European Space Agency, IUE recorded ultraviolet emissions\nusing two ground control centers from which the experimenters\ncould direct the observations of the satellite mu ch as is done with\ntelescopes in observatories on Earth.\nAn intensified activity for NASA in the latter half of the 1970s\nwas the congressionally mandated study of Earth\'s upper atmosphere,\nto learn more about the effects of gases such as freon on the ozone\nlayer. A continuous measuring program resulted; several agencies\nprovided data from which a detailed model of the complex processes\ncould be constructed.\nThe space applications program was active in the late 1970s.\nCommunications research continued with the launch in 1976 of\nCommunications Technology Satellite I. A joint project with Canada, CTS\nI investigated the possibilities of high-powered satellites transmitting\npublic service information to small, inexpensive antennas in remote\nlocations.\nLandsat 3 was launched in 1978, providing continuity for the\nflow of data to a growing number of users of Earth-resources\ninformation. The most ambitious new Earth-resources program was\nin agriculture. Encouraged by the results of the experimental Large\nArea Crop Inventory Experiment that ended in 1978 after demonstrating 90% accuracy in predicting the wheat production in the U.S.\nSouthern Great Plains and USSR, the Department of Agriculture,\nwith technical assistance from NASA and NOAA, began AgRISTARS\n(Agriculture and Resources Inventory Surveys Through Aerospace\nRemote Sensing).\nA new form of resources surveying was attempted in 1978 with\nthe launch of Seasat I. Intended to report on such variables as sea\ntemperature, wave heights, surface-wind speeds and direction, sea\nice, and storms, Seasat I was an instant success. Unfortunately its life\nwas cut short after three months in orbit by electrical power failure.\nEnough data had been recorded, however, to verify the effectiveness\n\nj\n\n94\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nof the instrumentation and the existence of a group of potential users\nin the weather, maritime, and fisheries communities.\nIn environmental research, NASA launched Nimbus 7 in 1978,\nthe last of the series oflarge, experimental weather satellites. One of\nits instruments, together with one on Nimbus 4 and the observations\nof SAGE (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment, launched in\n1979), provided a profile and model of the ozone layer. The nation\'s\nweather satellite system was augmented in 1978 by the launch of\nTiros-N and NOAA 6, the first two of a new generation of improved\nweather satellites in near-polar orbit. Tiros-N was a principal U.S\ncontributor to the international Global Atmospheric Research\nProgram.\nIn geophysical research, a small experimental Heat Capacity\nMapping Mission satellite was launched in 1978 to derive day and night\ntemperatures of rock formations as a possible means of locating\nmineral-bearing strata. In 1979 another small satellite, Magsat, went\ninto low orbit to take finer scale readings of anomalies in Earth\'s\nmagnetic field that are directly related to crustal structure and\ntherefore to possible mineral deposits. In earthquake research\nNASA completed in 1979 the fourth phase of data gathering along\nthe San Andreas Fault in California. By means of satellite ranging\nfrom specified points along both sides of the fault, experimenters\nestimated that the tectonic plates were moving 6 to 12 centimeters\nper year.\nThe largest consumer of the NASA budget and of management\nattention during the late 1970s was the Space Shuttle. Since its\nbeginnings in the early 1970s, the development story for the Space\nShuttle had been quite different from that of Apollo in the 1960s. The\noriginal projected costs had been halved to win the necessary\npolitical approval of the program; this cut was only achieved by\nmaking severe compromises in the original design-from a system\nthat would take off from a runway like an airplane, fly into orbit, and\nreturn to land on a\xc2\xb7runway like an airplane, to a system that would\ntake off vertically like a rocket, jettison the boosters and fuel tanks,\nand return to land on a runway like an airplane. This initial\ncompromise was not to be the last, as the budget continued to Qe lean\nyear after year. Potential development problems were worked\naround because the money was not available to investigate them. The\nconsequences of this insufficient level of research during the\ndevelopment cycle were not apparent in the years when the Shuttle\nwas bei\xc2\xb7ng designed and the components fabricated. As late as 1977,\n\nl\n\nA HISTORY OF\n\nACA AND\n\n95\n\nA A, 1915- 1980\n\n.J)/i\n\nwhen the orbiter Enterprise was carried to altitude by\n!d\ndropped to make approach and landing flights at Dryden Flight\nResearch Center, progress was seen to be sure, if a little slow .\nBy 1978 it became obvious that serious problems were dogging\nthe main engines. A cluster of three of these high-pressure liquidhydrogen-fueled engines would propel the orbiter into orbit, aided\nby twO solid-rocket boosters . ot only were the main engines\nexpected to produce the highest specific impulse of any rocket\nengine yet flown, but they also had to be throttleable and reusableto fire again and again for many flights before being replaced. When\nby 1979 a series of painstaking component-by-component analyses\nhad identified and fixed most of the problems and individual\nengines were experiencing better test runs, the first firings of the\nclustered engines generated a new set of problems . Grudgingly these\ntoo yielded to concentrated engineering rework; by the end of 1980\nthe total requirement of 80000 seconds of test firing was at hand.\nThe other pacing item on the orbiter was the thermal protection\ntiling that would shield most of the orbiter surface from the searing\nheat of reentry. Manufacture and application of the 33 000 tiles\nlagged so badly that early in 1979 NASA decided to ferry the orbiter\nfrom the manufacturer\'s plant in California to Kennedy Space\nCenter so that the remainder of the tiles could be applied there while\nother work and system checks were being done. But problems\ncontinued. The tiles were brittle and easily damaged; they did not\nbond to the metal properly and thousands had to be reapplied; they\nwere too fragile and more thousands had to be removed, made more\ndense, and reapplied. Between the tiles and the engines, the Space\nShuttle budget overran for several years and the date for the first\nflight slipped two painful years, with serious consequences for many\ngovernment, domestic, and international customers. By the end of\n1980, however, first flight in the spring of 1981 seemed truly\npossible. Operational flights were solidly booked out to the middle\nof the 1980s and the other three orbiters were moving through\nmanufacturing.\nNASA\'s advanced research examined a range of improvements\nfor space, energy, and aeronautical systems. Research on space\nsystems included new kinds of thermal coatings for portions of the\nSpace Shuttle orbiter, lighter weight and more heat-resistant structural\ncomponents made from composite materials for use in spacecraft, a\ncharge-coupled sensor for exploring the near-infrared portion of the\nspectrum, a small liquid-oxygen-fueled engine for orbital transfer,\n\n"\n., dStates\nUnlle\n\nThe Space Shuttle had its successes and problems. Above, the orbiter Enterprise is\ntouching down at Dryden Flight Research Center in October 1977 as it nears the end oj\nits successful descent and landing tests. Below, in July 1980 some 8000 thermal\nprotection tiles were still to be installed on the orbiter.\n\nion thrusters for long-distance spaceflight or station keeping, and\nsolar cells five times lighter and thinner than previous ones.\nThe late 1970s witnessed a substantial increase in energy\nresearch in NASA as the nation reacted to the oil shortages of 1973\nand 1978. Mosdy funded by the Department of Energy, the research\nhas employed many of NASA\'s traditional skills: in propulsion,\n\nA HISTORY OF\n\nACA A 0 NASA, 19 15- 1980\n\n97\n\ndevelopment of automotive and industrial gas turbines; in energy\ngeneration, development of improved and cheaper solar cells, longlife fu el celis, and large, more efficient wind turbines.\nIn aeronautical research, the focus in these years was on making\naircraft more efficient in use of energy, making engines quieter, and\nreducing poliution. One approach to energy conservation was\nreduction of aircraft weight through the use of composite materials\nin structural components. Another was in systematic improvement\nof engine components for better fuel and emission performance and\nfor durability. Another was improved aerodynamic performance,\nfirst with the supercritical wing and then with the oblique wing,\nwhich by altering its angle of attack vis-a.-vis the fuselage could tailor\nlift to speed; use of winglets, which promise a 6-8% reduction in\ndrag; slotted panels on the wings to restore laminar flow of air over\nthe wing, thereby reducing drag. Emission control was improved by\n25-30% for large turbine engines in 1976-1977 and extended to\nsmall turbines in 1978 and 1979.\nLOO KI NG AHEAD\n\nNASA budgets of the late 1970s permitted few new starts. By\n1979, for example, launches for NASA\'s own program-as opposed\nto those NASA launched for others-were down to three, by 1980 to\none . The planetary missions that were the most exciting part of the\nspace program in the last half of the 1970s have been reduced to one\nmission in the first half of the 1980s: Calileo will send an orbiter and\nan atmospheric probe to Jupiter, beginning in 1984. In space\nastronomy, the Space Telescope is the central mission. In orbit, it will\nextend man\'s vision almost to the edge of the universe, exceeding the\ncapability of the best ground-based telescope by seven times the\ndistance that can be penetrated and by 50 times the faintness of\nobjects that can be detected. In solar physics, the International Solar\nPolar Mission, to launch in 1983, will use the gravity assist ofJupiter to\napproach the sun out of the ecliptic plane and view directly its polar\nareas. In applications, Landsat D, equipped with new-generation\nsensors, is to be launched in 1982.\nOf all programs coming into flight status in the first half of the\n1980s, the most promising in possibilities for innovation and\nunforeseen opportunities is the Space Shuttle. Designed to be a\n"space truck" that places into orbit all United States satellites as well\nas corporate and international satellites, designed to operate with the\nSpacelab that offers scientists shirtsleeve-comfort access to the space\n\n98\n\nORDERS OF MAGNITUDE\n\nenvironment, the Space Shuttle will much enlarge the possibilities of\nexploitation of the space environment. From its first few flights, it\nshould unveil other aptitudes and unexpected potential, challenging\nthe human imagination to continue to explore the largest laboratory\nman will ever have-the universe.\nRETROSPECT\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nWhere has NASA taken us? From the thin ribbon of Earth\'s\natmosphere out to the edge of the solar system in two decades. The\nmoon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Saturn being explored.\nPulsars, quasars, black holes, all stunning clues to the life cycle of the\nuniverse. Solar flares, the corona, the internal structure of the sun, all\nof which have illuminated research to harness fusion energy on\nEarth. Quiet aircraft engines, the supercritical wing, economies in\nfuel consumption in aircraft. Vast improvements in worldwide\ncommunications, weather prediction, crop inventories, in knowledge\nof oceanic ice movements, offish migrations, or urban development,\nof broad patterns of geological formations relating to earthquakes\nand mineral deposits. An expanded industrial and university capability for high-caliber research and development, for ultraprecision,\nhigh-performance workmanship. Thousands of new products in the\ncommercial marketplace. These were some of the more immediate\nreturns from the $79-billion investment this nation had made in civil\naeronautics and space research through 1980.\nBeyond these immediate returns, which are most noteworthy of\nthe less tangible but nonetheless real returns on investment? The\ninternational space program, with more than 80 nations involved in\nmutually beneficial space projects? The joint Soviet-American\nmanned spaceflight, which straightened at least momentarily the\ntortuous path of superpower competition by its irrefutable need for,\nand achievement of, significant cooperation? The longer term\nimport of new insights from space sciences on origins of our\nspacecraft Earth, its mineral and energy resources, the fragility of its\nthin atmospheric envelope?\nAnd beyond the present and near future, what of the historical\nlessons? Where else in the 20th-century history of our nation is more\nclearly encapsulated our dangerous national trait of international\nroulette, of a deep-seated complacency that can be penetrated only\nby extreme challenge: World War I and the too-late founding of\nNACA; World War II and the belated threefold expansion ofNACA;\n\'the Cold War and scrambling from behind to NASA and Apollo?\n\nI\n\nI\n\nL\n\nI\n\n__ J\n\nr--\n\nI\nI\n\nA HISTORY OF NACA A D NASA , 19 15- 1980\n\n99\n\nThe course of history tells us that new truths, once exposed, defy\nturning back the clock. The door to aeronautics and space has been\nopened. It can no more be slammed shut than could the door\nopened by Gutenberg\'s printing press or by gunpowder; by Galileo\'s\ntelescope or by the steam engine; by Pasteur\'s discovery of germs or\nby the unleashing of nuclear energy. History impartially muses: who\nwill have the vision and steadfastness of purpose to make the most of\nthis newly opened door?\nFinally, what of long-term questions ? Will peaceful space\ncompetition prove to be a constructive alternative to war on Earth?\nWill space colonization be the eventual answer to overpopulation\nand depletion of the fragile planet Earth? Are there super-civilizations\nsomewhere in the universe that can teach Earthlings how to resolve\ntheir self-centered conflicts?\nAt this stage in our excursion into the vastness of space, it is of\ncourse too early to venture answers. We are presumptuous even to\nformulate questions. In all humility, only one finding is certain: our\nfirst faltering steps into space have reaped incalculable, unforeseen\nrewards. Future possibilities are as limitless as man\'s enterprise\nchooses to venture.\n\n_J\n\n1\n\nBibliography\nThe history of aeronautics, and even more so the history of\nastronautics, is fertile territory for the researcher, simply because it is\na big field in which little serious work has been done.\nThe most ready access to NASA history is probably through the\nexisting and forthcoming volumes of history and chronology produced\nin the NASA historical program . A list of such publications is\navailable on request from the NASA History Office, NASA Hq.,\nWashington, D. C. 20546 . The archives of the History Office are open\nto researchers. Each of the NASA installations maintains record files\non its portion of the NASA program and accession lists as a guide to\nrecords retired to the regional Federal Record Centers. The computerized information system RECON offers quick access to the technical\nliterature.\nThe following titles will be helpful to those interested in the\nhistory of aeronautical research and the space program:\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nl\n\nBenson, Charles D., and William Barnaby Faherty.
