INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Objectives\n\nBoth the military and civilian segments of aviation are placing an increasing reliance on flight simulators for\naircraft research and development and for pilot training and proficiency maintenance. Because of the increasing\nsophistication and associated costs of available simulation devices, issues relating to trade-offs between simulation\nfidelity and costs have risen to highly visible levels. When determining the simulator configuration to meet a\nspecific goals, the designer must consider the need for particular cueing devices as well as the requisite level of\nfidelity, and he should understand the constraints placed upon man-machine system performance (including\nperformance/workload trade-offs), as well as costs, imposed by that level of simulation fidelity.\n\nTo address these issues, NASA-LaRC undenook a combined experimental and analytical program to develop\ndata and methodologies for the evaluation and specification of simulator validity and fidelity. The experimental\nprogram involved ground-based simulator experiments at NASA-LaRC facilities and in-flight tests, using an "F-14"\naircraft, performed at Edwards Air Force Base. BBN\'s role in this effon was to first analyze the simulator results\nwith the aid of the optimal control model (OCM) for pilot-vehicle systems for the purposes of (1) "calibrating" the\nmodel as required for the subject pool and task environment, and (2) providing an analytic explanation for\nperformance differences, if any, among the cuing conditions explored in the simulation. This analysis was to be\nfollowed by an analysis of the in-flight tests, again with the goal of using the model to provide an analytic\nframework for whatever performance differences might be found between ground-based and in-flight performance.\n\nA substantial portion of BBN\'s effon was devoted to obtaining an accurate and workable linear model of the\nsimulated air-to-air combat task. The plan of attack described above was not completed because of difficulties\nencountered in the production of the NASA data base, panicularly with respect to the in-flight tests. During the\ncontract performance period, however, the Calspan Corporation provided BBN with a data base obtained from a\ncombined ground-based and in-flight simulation study of simulator fidelity using an NT-33A\n\nv~able-stability\n\naircraft. I Given this situation, the best available course of action in suppon of the goals of the contract was to\nperform model analysis of the NT-33A data base.\n\nICalspan Corporation, Air Force Contract No. F3361S-83-C-3606\n\n--------------------------------~----------------------------------------------------------------~\n\nIn effect, BBN\'s effort under the NASA contract was condilcted in two phases: (1) model development and\ndata analysis relevant to the NASA simulation study, and (2) analysis of the NT-33A data base. The Phase I effort\nhas been described in an interim report (Levison and Baron, 1984) and in subsequent progress reports. The results\nof this phase are summarized briefly below; the bulk of this report is devoted to a summary of the Phase 2 effort.\n\n1.2 Review of the Phase 1 Effort\nThe task explored in the NASA simulation and in-flight tests involved an "F-14" aircraft tracking a target\naircraft executing a 3g wind-up tum.\n\nOnce steady-state undisturbed tracking was achieved, the vertical\n\ndisplacement of the reticle (sight) of the pursuing aircraft was disturbed by a random appearing signal. The\nsimulator experiments duplicated this task under a variety of cuing conditions. Data were obtained using two\nground-based simulators: the moving-base Visual Motion Simulator (VMS) and the fixed-base Differential\nManeuvering Simulator (OMS). Four experimental conditions were explored in each simulator: with and without\n"motion", and with and without g-seat cuing. The "motion" condition represented whole-body motion cuing in the\nVMS and helmet-loading in the OMS. The same subjects performed in both simulators as well as in the "F-14".\nAs noted above, much of the Phase 1 BBN effort was devoted to formulating a model of the air-to-air tracking\n\ntask. including (l) modeling the target kinematics. (2) developing the linearized line-of- sight equations, (3)\nreducing the dimensionality of the overall model. (4) validating the math model against the NASA simulation, and\n(5) performing a sensitivity analysis with the model to explore the effects of assumptions concerning the simulator\nand/or the pilot. These results have been summarized by Levison and Baron (1984).\nStatistical analysis of the tracking scores obtained in the NASA simulation studies revealed the following\ngeneral trends.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Effects of non-visual cuing ("motion" or "g-seat") were neither large nor statistically significant.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Differences across subjects were relatively large and statistically significant.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Although not found to be statistically significant, the VMS/DMS differences in lateral-axis LOS errors\nwere relatively large.\nThe lack of differences across cuing conditions is consistent with post-experiment model analysis which\n\nshowed a predicted lack of sensitivity of line-of-sight tracking error to the presence of motion cues (Baron and\nLevison, 1984).\n\n2\n\nI:\n\n1.3 The NT -33A Study\n\nThe major objective of the NT-33A study was to explore the effects of control system delays on closed-loop\nperformance in ground-based and in-flight simulations of an attitude tracking task. Pre-experiment model analysis\nwas performed by BBN to help specify certain experimental variables: primarily, parameters of the external forcing\nfunctions to be used in the steady-state tracking segments of the NT-33A simulations. The pre-experiment analysis\nhas been documented by Levison and Papazian( 1986): major predictions yielded by this analysis were:\n1. modest increases in tracking error score with increasing delay,\n\n2. larger delay effects for the generic high-performance fighter flown aggressively ("F-16") than for the\n\ngeneric heavy transport ("C-141") flown in a more relaxed manner,\n3. relatively small differences (less than 10%) between performance in-flight and in the ground-based\nsimulations, and\n4. similar relative effects of experimental variable on performance in the pitch and roll axes.\n\nAs shown in this report, these pre-experiment predictions were largely confirmed by the manned simulation\nexperiments.\n\nPost-experiment analysis included statistical analysis of steady-state tracking performance metrics and model\nanalysis using the same optimal control model (OCM) employed earlier in the study. The reader is assumed to be\nfamiliar with the structure and application of this model. The major objectives of the model analysis were to help\nexplain any differences that might arise between experimental results and the results predicted by pre-experiment\nanalysis, and to explore the utility of the OCM as a potential tool for interpolating the results of simulation\nexperiments designed to explore time delay effects.\n\nA subset of the NT-33A experimental conditions was analyzed by BBN. Pitch- and roll-axis performance in\nsingle-axis target-tracking tasks was analyzed for the following combinations of experimental variables: (a) "F-16"\nand "C-141" aircraft dynamics, (b) zero and 180 msec simulation delay added to the irreducible simulation delay of\nabout 100 msec, and (c) ground-based and in-flight simulations. In addition, the combined-axis performance in roll\nand pitch were analyzed for the following combination of experimental variables: (a) "F-16" and "C-141" dynamics,\n(b) zero and 180 msec added delay, and (c) target and disturbance inputs. In-flight performance for combined-axis\ntasks was not analyzed by BBN because data were not available for all test pilots.\n\n3\n\n______________--__________~~--------------------------------------------------------r\n\n"Single-axis" tasks were tasks in which an external forcing function was applied to either the roll or the pitch\naxis, but not both. Forcing functions were applied to both axes in the "combined-axis" tasks. In all cases, the pilot\nwas required to control both the pitch and roll axes.\n\n1.4 Organization of this Report\nThe remainder of this report presents the results of the analysis performed by BBN on the NT-33A data.\n\nProcedures used in performing both statistical analysis and model analysis on the experimental data are reviewed in\nChapter 2. Major results are presented in Chapter 3, and the discussion provided in Chapter summarizes these\nresults, outlines a procedure for a combined analytical and experimental approach to studying simulator fidelity\nissues, and suggests areas of further study aimed toward development and validation of this approach.\n\n4\n\n"\n\n2. ANALYSIS PROCEDURES\n\n2.1 Statistical Analysis of Tracking Performance\nMeans and standard errors were obtained for closed-loop perfonnance metrics and for pilot frequency\nresponse measures as described below.\n\n2.1.1 Closed-Loop Performance Metrics\nPrimary data reduction was perfonned by Cal span; BBN perfonned the subsequent averaging across\nreplications and across subjects. Within-trial mean and standard-deviation (SD) scores were first computed for all\nimportant problem variables.\n\nThese scores were then averaged across the two replications/subject to provide\n\naverage perfonnance measures for each subject for each of the experimental conditions considered in the BBN\nanalysis. Finally, popUlation means and estimated standard errors of the population means were computed for each\ncondition of interest. The summary statistics reported later in this report are the means and standard errors of the SD\nscores for tracking error, control force, and control force-rate.\n\n2.1.2 Frequency-Response Metrics\nPilot frequency-response metrics consisted of the describing function -- shown as "gain" (more properly,\n"amplitude-ratio") and phase-shift" curves, and curves of the pilot\'S "remnant" (the spectral density of that portion of\nthe pilot\'s control or "stick" force that is not linearly correlated with the external forcing function).\n\nIt was originally intended that analysis techniques appropriate to sum-of-sines (SOS) inputs would be\nemployed (Zacharias and Levison, 1979). Because the nominal SOS input used in this study had significant power\nat off-nominal input frequencies (Le. "sideband power"), the analysis technique was modified to be appropriate to\ninputs continuous in frequency. Specifically, the pilot\'s describing function was estimated at each nominal SOS\nfrequency as:\n\n5\n//\n\n//\n\n------------------------------~----------------------------------------------------~--------------~\n\nH =\n\nwhere H is the describing function expressed as a complex number, and I,E. and U are the Fourier coefficients of the\nexternal input, the tracking error, and pilot\'s control response, respectively, obtained from fast-Fourier analysis. The\noverstrike signifies averaging of the cross-power terms over a frequency range of approximately 1/4 octave centered\nabout the nominal SOS frequency.\n\nThe remnant power was computed in the. vicinity of each SOS input frequency as:\n\nRemnant\n\n= IUl 2\n\nBecause of the significant amount of pilot remnant. intra- and inter-subject averaging of the describing\nfunctions was performed using techniques recently developed to maximize the reliability of the averaging process\n(Levison, 1985).\n\nIndividual describing function as defined above were not averaged; instead, averaging was\n\nperformed on the cross-power quantities, first across replications and then across subjects. The inter-subject average\ndescribing function was then computed as shown in Equation 1, where the numerator and denominator terms now\nrepresent inter-subject averages. The resulting complex number H was the converted to equivalent gain and phase\nshift.\n\nBecause phase shift is defined only within a cycle, the OeM was used to generate a theoretical reference\ncurve to "unwrap" the phase curve. This unwrapping procedure has been described by Levison, Junker, and Kenner\n(1985).\nEstimated standard errors of the mean gain and phase shift were computed from the variability of the\ncross-power spectral measures as described by Levison (1985). Inter-subject statistics on the remnant estimates\nwere obtained via the same procedures adopted for the closed-loop performance metrics.\n\n6\n\nI:\n\n2.2 Model Analysis\n\nA major objective of the model analysis was to explore the potential of the OeM as a tool for interpolating the\nresults of manned simulations, rather than to obtain the best curve fit possible. Therefore, independent "pilotrelated" model parameters were not subjected to the type of unrestricted gradient search identification procedure that\nhas been used appropriately in the past for quantifying operator capabilities (Levison, 1981).\n\nInstead. model\n\nanalysis was initiated with parameters selected from previous laboratory studies, and subsequent parameter changes\nwere made only as required to provide an acceptable subjective match to the data for certain baseline conditions.\nPredictions were then obtained for other experimental conditions with no further changes in pilot-related parameters.\nIn order to maximize computational efficiency, most of the model analysis was conducted to provide\ncomparisons with the average performance of the three test pilots. There were substantial inter-subject differences\nhowever, and some analysis was conducted to explore these differences.\nIn this section of the memo we describe the procedure by which independent model parameters were selected.\nInterpretation of the specific values selected is provided in Chapter 4.\nNon-zero values were assigned to the following pilot-related model parameters:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Motor Time Constant. This parameter reflects bandwidth limitations imposed by the pilot/stick\ninterface. Values on the order of 0.09 to 0.13 seconds are typical for force sticks and optimal control\ngains. Larger values have been found for sticks having significant displacement characteristics\n(Repperger and Levison, 1984).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Operator Delay. A pure transport delay is associated with the operator\'s response characteristics. This\nOeM independent parameter is generally not influenced by the tracking task; a value of 0.2 seconds is\ntypical. When the tracking task contains display-related delays that show up in the computation of the\npilot describing function, such delays should be included in the "operator delay" to allow a meaningful\ncomparison of measured and predicted operator phase shift. For this study, operator delay was fixed at\n0.22 seconds -- 0.20 for the operator and 0.02 for display delay.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Penalty on Control Force. For tasks in which the control gain is optimal. there is generally no need to\nassign a performance penalty (i.e., a non-zero "cost coefficient" in the quadratic performance index) to\ncontrol force or displacement Where significant forces are required, however, a specific penalty\nassociated with control force (or possibly control rate) improves the match to operator performance\n(Levison, 1984). The control penalty is expressed here as the numerical value of the control SD score\nthat contributes one unit of cost to the performance index. (Note: one unit of cost is assigned to an SD\nscore of 1 degree for roll or pitch tracking error.)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Residual Noise on Error Perception. The OeM allows the user to specify a "residual noise" standard\n\n7\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_/\n\ndeviation for each of the perceptual variables used by the pilot to reflect the effects of threshold-like\nphenomena such as perceptual resolution limitations and "indifference thresholds". Residual noise is\nusually set to zero for laboratory tracking tasks that use symbolic displays with optimal display gains.\nIn general, however, nonzero residual noise should be specified for non-ideal perceptual environments\nsuch as real-world visual scene cues (Levison and Warren, 1984), or when the operator is indifferent to\nerrors below a certain level.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Observation Noise Ratio. Pilot remnant is modeled largely as an observation (perceptual) noise\nprocess. Except for the residual noise term, observation noise is assumed to scale with the rms value of\nthe perceived variable. An "observation noise ratio" of around -20 dB is typical for laboratory\nexperiments. Based on the results of a recent laboratory study of time-delay effects (Levison and\nHuggins, 1986), this parameter was fixed at -19 dB for this analysis.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Motor Noise Ratio. Except for tasks using very large control sensitivities, or human operators with\nsubstantial neurological "tremor", this term is negligible. It was fixed at -90 dB for this analysis.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Internal Motor Noise Ratio. To reflect certain limitations on the operator\'s ability to predict the effects\nof his control input on vehicle response, we assign a small but non-negligible value to the "internal"\nmotor noise (i.e .. the pilot\'s perception of his motor noise variance). This parameter was fixed at -44\ndB based on the Levison and Huggins study.\n\nThree pilot-related parameters were varied during the course of this analysis: motor time constant, the control\npenalty, and residual noise on tracking error. The remaining parameters were kept fixed as described above.\n\nFor the purposes of model analysis, the "baseline" condition was defined as single-variable tracking, target\n\ninput. ground-based simulation. zero added delay. There were thus four experimental baseline tracking tasks: pitch\nand roll, "F-16" and "C-141".\n\nThe approach to model analysis was to first obtain two "calibration" sets of\n\nindependent model parameters -- one providing the best joint match to "F-16" and "C-141" performance in roll, and\none providing a joint match to pitch-axis performance for the baseline conditions. With parameters held fixed at the\nappropriate baseline values. predictions were then obtained for (1) the effects of additional delay on performance,\nand (2) performance differences between ground and in-flight simulation.\n\nValues used in the pre-experiment analysis -- shown in the first column of Table 2-1 -- were used in an initial\nattempt to match the roll-axis data.\n\nThese values proved to be too optimistic in terms of predicting average\n\nperformance. In particular, the experimental tracking errors scores were substantially larger than predicted. the\ncontrol scores were lower than predicted. and the remnant was greater than predicted.\nTable 2\xc2\xb71: Independent Parameters Adjusted During the Model analysis\n\nParameter\n\nInitial\n\nRoll\n\n0.12\n\n0.20\n\nO.\nO.\n\nMOtor Time Constant, sec\nControl for Unit Cost, pounds\nRms Residual Noise, degrees\n\nO.\n75.\n\nPitch\n0.15\n20.\n2.25\n\nThe predicted control and control-rate scores were brought into general agreement with the data by increasing\n\n8\n\nIi\n\nthe motor time constant to 0.20 seconds. This action had the additional effect of increasing the predicted tracking\nerror score, but not by the amount needed to match experimental results.\nExamination of the performance of individual test pilots showed substantial inter-subject differences. Pilot A\nwas the best performer in terms of minimizing the roll-error SD score; his performance could be matched with\nvalues near those initially selected. As noted above, considerations of efficiency dictated that the bulk of the\nanalysis be performed on average performance, and the discussion here is relevant to average performance. Later in\nthis report we document some of the inter-subject differences.\nOne or more model parameters related to pilot remnant had to be modified to provide better matches to\nexperimental tracking error scores and remnant spectra. Increasing the observation noise tended to provide a better\nmatch to the remnant at mid and high frequencies, whereas including the residual noise improved the match at low\nfrequencies. Both methods were initially explored, but the residual-noise adjustment seemed to provide slightly\nbetter predictive capabilities and is therefore the method that was pursued.\nA residual noise of around 75 degrees was required to provide an acceptable match to the baseline data (i.e.,\npredicted SD scores within 10-15% of the experimental scores) for the roll axis. lbis value was much larger than\nwould be needed to accommodate an indifference threshold of 5 degrees that one might infer from the instructions to\nthe test pilots. As we show later in this report, this large value might reflect, in part, significant nonlinearities in the\n\npilot\'s response behavior.\nThe pitch-axis baseline tasks were then modeled. The motor time constant of 0.2 seconds obtained in the\n\nroll-axis match was reduced to 0.15 to provide a better match to the control and control-rate scores, and the residual\nnoise was readjusted to match tracking error. Introduction of the control penalty for the pitch-axis task provided a\nsomewhat better match to the "F-16"f\'C-141" performance differences. (A subsequent re-analysis of the roll-axis\ntask showed that the same control penalty had negligible effect on predicted roll-axis performance.)\nOnce calibrated for the baseline tasks, the pilot-related model parameters considered above were held fixed as\nthe effects of experimental variables were predicted. Changes in experimental conditions were modeled as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Vehicle delay. The addition of delay to the simulated vehicle\'s control-system delay was modeled by\nsimply incrementing the "vehicle delay" parameter of the OCM by the same amount. (A baseline\nvehicle delay of 0.08 seconds was included to reflect irreducible simulator delays exclusive of displayrelated delay.)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ground/flight differences. The parameterization defined above pertains to the ground-based simulation.\nTo account for the effects of in-flight simulation, display variables associated with perception of whole-\n\n9\n\n--------------------~--------------------------------------------~/\n\nbody motion cues were assigned fractional attentions of unity. These variables were vehicle roll rate\nand roll acceleration for roll-axis tracking, and vehicle pitch rate, pitch acceleration, and normal\n\nacceleration for pitch-axis tracking.\nCombined-axis tracking. Implicit in the parameterization defined above is the assumption that the\npilots could devote nearly full attention to the control axis containing the external forcing-function for\nthe single-axis tasks. For combined-axis tracking, we assume that the pilot\'s must allocate attention in\nroughly equal proportions to the pitch- and roll-axis tracking tasks.\xc2\xb7 Combined-axis tracking was\ntherefore modeled by increasing the observation noise ratio by 3 dB (equivalent to assigning fractional\nattentions of 0.5 to all perceived variables).\n\n10\n\nIi\n\n3. Principal Results\nThe results of the statistical and model analysis are presented together in this chapter. Results are organized\nas follows: (1) closed-loop performance metrics. (2) frequency-response measures, and (3) nonlinear analysis of\nselected time histories.\n\n3.1 Closed-Loop Performance Measures\nMeans and standard errors for tracking error. stick force, and stick force rate SO scores are tabulated in the\nappendix for the conditions analyzed by BBN. Also tabulated are the corresponding model predictions.\n\nEffects of added delay and simulator mode on measured and predicted SO scores are shown in Figure 3-1 for\nthe roll-axis task and in Figure 3-2 for the pitch-axis task. These results pertain to single-axis target-following tasks.\n\nThe trends of the tracking error scores were generally as predicted by the pre-experiment model analysis (and\nconfirmed by the post-experiment model analysis shown in the figures):\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Addition of 180 msec delay produced a modest increase in the SO score.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Delay effects are relatively greater for the "F-16" dynamics than for the "e-141".\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ground-base simulation produced somewhat larger error scores than in- flight simulation, but the\neffects of simulator mode on performance were less than the effects of control-system delay for the\ndelays considered in this analysis.\n\nAs in a previous study of time-delay effects (Levison and Huggins, 1986), the mOdel tended to slightly\n\nunderestimate the relative increase in error due to added delay. Model/data discrepancies of this sort were, however,\nwithin the experimental standard error and cannot be considered statistically significant.\n\nThe largest model-data discrepancy concerning tracking error scores -- the only difference likely to be\nstatistically significant -- occurred for "F-16" pitch-axis tracking (Figure 3-2a), where the model underestimated\ndifferences between in-flight and ground simulator performance.\n\nThis trend has been seen in some previous\n\nexperiments in which the benefits of whole-body motion cuing have not been fully accounted for by the kind of\nsimple informational treatment conducted here (Levison, Lancraft, and Junker, 1979). Ground/flight differences for\n\nthe remaining error scores ("e-141" pitch. "F-16" and "e-141" roll), however, are predicted rather closely.\n\n11\n\nb) "C-141", ROLL ERROR\n\na) "F-16", ROLL ERROR\n\n15\n\n15\n\n-;;\n\nil\n\ne\n\n10\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n-i\n\n~\n\n0\n\n10\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\nw\n\n(5\n\na:\n\n5\n\xc2\xb7DATA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0\nMode\nDelay\n\nG F\n0\n\n8~\n\nMODEL\n0 Ground\n0\nFlight\n0\nMode\nDelay\n\nG F\n180\n\nc) "F-16", STICK FORCE\n\nG F\n0\n\nG F\n180\n\nd) "C-141", STICK FORCE\n\n5\n\n-\n\ni~\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\nlit\n\n"C\nC\n\n:::I\n\n!\n\nQ)\n(J\n~\n\n0\n\nu.\n~\n\n(J\n\n8i\n\n~\n\n~~\n\n~\n\n1\n\n1\n0\nMode\nDelay\n\ne\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nO~\n\nG F\n0\n\n0\nMode\nDelay\n\nG F\n180\n\nG F\n0\n\nFigure 3-1: Effects of Delay and Simulator Mode on SO Performance Scores, Roll Axis\nTarget-tracking task.\nAverage of 3 subjects, 2 replications/subject.\nG = ground-base,\nr = in-flight.\n\n12\n\nG F\n180\n\na) "F\xc2\xb716", PITCH ERROR\n\nb) "C\xc2\xb7141", PITCH ERROR\n\n.5\n\n.5\n\ne~\n\n.4\n\n-;\n~\n\n.\n:9..\n\n.4\n\nio\n\ng\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.3\n\n0\n\nw\n\n.3\n\n.2\n\n~I!!I\n\n.2\n\n~\n\n...\nu\n\nDATA\n\nMODEL\nGround\n0 Flight\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xb0\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nii:\n\n.1\n0\nMode\nDelay\n\nG F\n0\n\n.1\n0\nMode\nDelay\n\nG F\n180\n\nc) "F\xc2\xb716", STICK FORCE\n\nd) "C\xc2\xb7141", STICK FORCE\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n~~\n\n"C\nC\n\n:::l\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n4\n\n-;\n\n!\n\ne~\n\n1.5\n\nu. 1.0\n~\n\nG F\n0\n\nG F\n180\n\n3\n\nQ)\n\nu\n0\n\n\xc2\xb00\n\nel!!l\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n00\n\n2\n\nu\n\n~\n\n.5\n0\nMode\nDelay\n\n1\n\nG F\n0\n\n0\nMode\nDelay\n\nG F\n180\n\nFigure 3-2: Effects of Delay and Simulator Mode on SD Performance Scores, Pitch Axis\n\nTarget-tracking task.\nAverage of 3 subjects, 2 replications/subject.\nG\nground-base, r\nin-flight.\n\n=\n\n=\n\n13\n\nFigure 3-1 c and 3-2c show little measured or predicted effects of experimental variables on the stick SD score\nfor "F-16" tasks. Effects of both delay and simulator mode are apparent in the "C-141" experimental data (Figures\n3-ld and 3-2d). The model mimicked the noticeable mode difference for the "C-141", zero-delay roll-axis task, but\nit did not predict the observed effects of delay on the "C-141" stick score.\n\nTable 3-1 provides a quantitative summary of the relative effects of the experimental factors of control-system\ndelay and simulator mode. Entries under the "delay" heading were obtained by taking the ratio of the populationaverage error SD score for the ISO-msec condition to the average error score for the zero-delay condition. Each\nentry in the table is the average of four such ratios (pitch and roll, ground and flight). Similarly, entries under the\n"simulator mode" heading were obtained by averaging the rations of the "ground" error scores to the "flight" error\nscores, averaged over the two axes and the two delay conditions. All data in this table pertain to the single-axis,\ntarget-tracking tasks.\nTable 3-1: Effects of Experimental Factors on Average Performance Ratios\nDelay\nSimulator Mode\n"1\'-16"\n"C-141"\n"1\'-16"\n"C-141"\nData\nModel\n\n1.25\n1.19\n\n1.21\n1.15\n\n1.18\n1.06\n\n1.03\n1.06\n\nAveraged over single-axis, target-tracking tasks.\nThree subjects, two replications/subject.\nTable 3-1 confinns the qualitative impressions obtained from Figure 3-1 and 3-2. In terms of the proportional\nincrease in tracking error scores, the addition of 180 msec delay had a greater effect than the transition from flight to\nground, and the effects of delay were slightly greater for the "F-16" than for the "C-141". The model replicated\nthese trends. although it did not predict the full extent of the delay effects.\n\nComparisons of experimental single- and combined-task performance for the zero and ISO-msec delay\nconditions are provided by Figures 3-3 and 3-4 for roll and pitch performance, respectively. Also shown are model\npredictions for the 2-axis, zero-delay conditions.\nCombined-task performance scores for the roll-axis were nearly identical to the single-task scores. Inspection\nof the standard errors provided in Table A-I of the Appendix suggests that the small differences shown in Figure 3-3\nwere not statistically significant.\n\nTaskloading had a more pronounced effect on pitch-axis performance.

Effects of\ntaskloading on pitch error was less consistent. The error scores for the zero-delay conditions were the same for the\n1- and 2-axis tasks, but the addition of 180 msec delay caused larger performance degradations for the combinedaxis tasks.\n\nThe horizontal bars in Figure 3-3 and 3-4 show that the model overestimated the differences between\ncombined-task and single-task performance, predicting differences in the error SD score on the order of 20% to 30%\nwhen, in fact, experimental differences were negligible. Because of the clear discrepancy between model and data\nwith regard to taskloading effects, model analysis was not performed for the 180-msec delay condition.\n\nThe tendency of the model to predict taskloading effects on tracking error when none were found\nexperimentally does not signify a structural defect of the OCM, but it does suggest a slight revision in the procedure\nfor selecting pilot parameters. Discussion of this issue is deferred to Chapter 4.\n\nEffects of system delay on combined-task disturbance-regulation scores are shown in Figures 3-5 and 3-6 for\nroll and pitch, respectively.\n\nAlthough contract resources did not allow modeling of the disturbance tasks,\n\ncomparisons of experimental results can be made to the pre-experiment model predictions documented by Levison\nand Huggins (1986).\n\nAs predicted by the model, the effect of delay on- "C-141" tracking error was about the same for the\n\ndisturbance-regulation task as for the target-following task. The trend of the "F-16" results was the reverse of that\npredicted, however. Pre-experiment model analysis indicted that delay would have a substantially smaller effect on\npitch-axis performance than on roll-axis, whereas the experimental data showed the opposite trend. Two factors may\n\naccount for this model/data discrepancy: (1) the pre-experiment model analysis was not conducted with independent\nparameters that provided the best match to the baseline data, and (2) the forcing functions applied experimentally\ndiffered in certain respect from those assumed for the initial model analysis. Additional model analysis of the\ndisturbance-trncking results would be needed to resolve this apparent discrepancy for the "F-16" task.\nDiscussion of the model has concentrated largely on the effects of delay and taskloading. It should also be\nnoted that the OCM accounted for performance differences between the two simulated aircraft that were considered\n\nin the BBN analysis.\n\n17\n\na)\n\nF-16, Roll Error\n\nC-14l, Roll Error\n\nb)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n\'""\'\nUl\nQ)\nQ)\n\nJ.<\n00\nQ)\n\n"tI\n\n\'-"\nJ.<\n0\nJ.<\nJ.<\nr:LI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.-l\n.-l\n\n~\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n180\nDelay (msec)\n\nc)\n\nF-16, Stick Force\n\n\'""\'\nUl\n"tI\n\n~\n\n::I\n\n0\n\n0.\n\'-"\n\n~ 0.5\n\nJ.<\n0\n\n180\nDelay (msec)\n\nd)\n\nC-14l, Stick Force\n\n4\n\n1.0\n.\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n2\n\n~\n\n..lI::\n\n1\n\ncJ\n..-I\n~\ntI)\n\n0\n0\n\no\n\n180\nDelay (msec)\n\n180\nDelay (msec)\n\nFigure 3-5: Effects of Delay on SD Perfonnance Scores for DistUJbance Regulation, Roll Axis\nAverage of 3 subjects, 2 rep1ications/subject\n\n18\n\na)\n\nF-16.

Discrete symbols and smooth curves indicate experimental data and model\n\nresults, respectively. A gain of 0 dB represents one pound control force per degree display error, and a remnant\nlevel of 0 dB represents a control power density level of one pound 2 per radian/second. All results pertain to\nsingle-axis, target-tracking tasks.\n\nAll frequency-response measurements are shown, regardless of the the standard error.\nfrequency measurements below 8 rad/sec are "reliable" in terms of a low standard error.\n\nIn general, all\n\nThe reliability of\n\nmeasurements at higher frequencies fluctuated quite a bit from one condition to the next. In general, measurements\nat the highest SOS frequency should be regarded with caution.\n\nFigure 3-7 shows that plant dynamics influenced primarily the pilot\'s response gain. the phase shift at mid\nfrequencies, and the remnant spectrum in the roll axis. The gain and remnant differences reflect. for the most part,\nthe different control gains provided for the two simulated aircraft. The pitch-axis data provided in Figure 3-8 show\ndifferent frequency dependencies for the two vehicles as well as differences in overall gain and remnant levels. In\nparticular, the "F-16" dynamics showed a more pronounced high-frequency peak in the gain response and a flatter\nphase response up to about 10 rad/sec than the "C-141" dynamics. Differences in pilot response across simulated\nvehicle and across axes of control were mimicked by the model.\n\nAs might be expected from the preceding discussion of closed-loop performance metrics, the effects of delay\nand simulation mode on pilot frequency response were substantially less than the effects of simulated aircraft\n\ndynamics. Figures 3\xc2\xb79 and 3\xc2\xb710 show that the qualitative effects of adding delay, in either axis. were to (1) slightly\ndecrease pilot gain at low and mid frequencies, (2) decrease the frequency at which the gain curve peaks, (3)\ndecrease phase lag (or increase phase lead) at mid frequencies, and (4) increase pilot remnant.\n\nAs correctly\n\npredicted by the model, the effects of delay on gain and phase shift were more pronounced for the pitch axis\nresponse.\n\nFigures 3-11 and 3-12 show some reduction in remnant and phase lag with the transition from ground to\nflight. The remnant curve may be interpreted as indicating a slightly wider response bandwidth for the in-flight\ntasks.

Examination of the individual performance of the three test pilots\nshowed considerable differences between the best-performing pilot (in terms of minimizing rms roll error) and the\nother two pilots. These results prompted the suspicion that the response strategies of the two less-well-performing\npilots might have contained significant nonlinearities, and that these nonlinearities might have resulted in the\napparent reduced bandwidth and larger tracking error characteristic of these pilots.\nNonlinear analysis consisted of visual inspection of time histories, and statistical analysis of the probability\ndensities, of one trial each for each of the three test pilots. The experimental condition represented by these trials\nwas roll-axis tracking, ground-based simulation, "F-16" dynamics without additional time delay, with an external\nsum-of-sines target-command signal active in the roll axis only.\n\n3.3.1 Visual Inspection of Time Histories\nInitial visual inspection of the pilot\'s output response ("stick") revealed substantial noise at the sampling\nfrequency (50 Hz), which was felt to be due largely to the quantization of the stick amplitu:1e imposed by the\nrecording technique. In order to prevent this noise from masking important response trends, the stick signal was\ndigitally filtered with a rectangular time window of 0.08 seconds. That is, each data point was replaced by the\nlocally-averaged stick amplitude.\n\nThis filtering operation significantly reduced high-frequency noise without\n\napparent distortion to signal components within the bandwidth of man/machine response.\nTime histories generated by the best-performing (Pilot A) and worst-performing (Pilot B) were inspected.\nNumerical printouts of the stick time histories were initially scanned for the appearances of intervals of little or no\nstick motion ("flat spots"). Five-second intervals containing these occurrences were then plotted for inspection.\nIn order to provide references against which to compare the experimental time histories, the following model\n\n27\n\nanalysis was perfonned. First, the various perfonnance metrics obtained from the two experimental trials were\nmatched with the steady-state optimal control model (OeM).\n\nThe simulation implementation of the OCM\n\n(Kleirunan, Baron, and Berliner, 1977) was then used to generate stick time histories for the 5-second time segments\nof interest, using the appropriate Cal span experimental forcing function as the driving function. If the model were to\nmatch the pilot\'S linear characteristics perfectly, and if the effects of pilot remnant remnant were negligible, the\nmodel and experimental stick time histories would be identical. Given the existence of remnant and the difficulty of\na perfect match, the model-generated time histories are intended more as a qualitative reference. Specifically, one\ncan detennine whether or not the model predicts the response trends exhibited by the data.\nTable 3-2 shows the independent "pilot-related" model parameters that were found to provide an acceptable\nmatch to the data Parameters shown for pilot A were initially selected on the basis of a recent BBN laboratory\nstudy on time-delay effects (Levison and Huggins. 1986). Only the motor time constant needed adjustment to\nprovide a qualitatively acceptable match to the perfonnance of Pilot A. To match the data of Pilot B, however,\nsignificant changes were made to remnant-related parameters, and the motor time constant was further increased to\nreflect the lower response bandwidth of this subject. The observation noise/signal ratio was increased by 4 dB, and a\nresidual noise of 15 degrees -- representative of a visual or "indifference" threshold of 5 degrees -- was included.\nThis residual noise value was consistent with the instructions given to the pilots, from which the pilots could infer\nthat it was not necessary to maintain roll errors below 5 degrees. Residual noise was not needed to match the\nperfonnance of Pilot A, however.\nTable 3-2: Independent Model Parameters\nParameter\n\nPilot A\n\nMotor Time Constant, sec\nOperator Delay, sec\nResidual Noise, Roll Angle, deg\nObservation Noise/Signal Ratio, dB\nInternal Motor H/S Ratio, dB\n\nPilot B\n\n0.16\n0.200\n0.0\n-19.0\n-44.0\n\n0.30\n0.225\n15.0\n-15.0\n-44.0\n\nTime histories for Pilot A are shown in Figure 3-13.

As noted above, these waveforms cannot be\nexpected to overlap exactly because of the stochastic response components (remnant) in both the experimental and\npredicted time histories. Nevertheless, one expects to see some correlation between the two because the same\nexternal forcing-function waveform has driven both the experimental and modeled systems.\nThe experimental stick response appears to show a tendency to remain relatively flat for an interval of about\n\n0.5 seconds beginning around 3l.5 seconds into the run. The model prediction does not support this tendency,\nsuggesting evidence of a response nonlinearity. Note, however, that the experimental error time history (Figure\n3-13c) also shows a relative flat spot over the same interval. If the pilot\'s response strategy were to act largely as a\ngain on roll error, this apparent pause in the pilot\'s response could be interpreted as a linear response to the error\nsignal.\nStronger evidence of nonlinear response behavior is revealed by the time histories of Pilot B in Figure 3-14.\nFigure 3-14a shows a relative pause in response activity of about 1 second, beginning around 43.5 seconds into the\nrun. The error signal plotted below does not reveal a similar flat spot, but rather a local maximum as the error\nreverses direction and heads toward zero. Furthermore, the model shows a more peaked response pattern (Figure\n3-13b) in response to the same type of error pattern (Figure 3-13d) as found in the data. In this case, the pilofs\nresponse is less indicative of a linear response strategy and more suggestive of a "move-and-wait" strategy in which\nthe pilot maintains a relatively constant control force that is sufficient to cause the error to begin to decrease. Other\n\nsegments of this pilot\'s response time history (not shown here) revealed qualitatively similar patterns.\n\n3.3.2 Statistical Analysis of Stick-Rate Amplitude\nObjective analysis of selected time histories was performed to explore quantitative manifestations of the\nmove-and-wait episodes subjectively found from visual inspection. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the\nstick rate would spend a larger fraction of time in the vicinity of zero than would a noisy but linearly responding\nsystem and that, therefore, the probability density of the stick rate amplitude would be significantly non-normal and\nwould show a larger peak in the vicinity of zero amplitude than a Gaussian density function. Time histories from\nthe three Calspan subjects were subjected to this type of analysis.\n\nComputation of time-history statistics proceeded as follows:\n\n30\n\na)\n\n..\n.\n\nb)\n\nStick (data)\n\n.\n\n"0\n\nc:\n\n.0\n\n;::.\n\nStick (model)\n\n::>\n0\n\n0\n\n~\n\n.,.\n\n~\n\n.\n\n~\n~\n\n,\n\n0\n\n]\n\n.~\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\n44\n\n-5\n\n45\n\n40\n\nTIME (seconds)\n\nC)\n\n41\n\n42\n\n45\n\nTIME (seconds)\n\nError (data)\n\nd)\n\n..\n\n45\n\nError (model)\n\n20\n\n-20\n\n15\n\n-15\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n\'Oi"\nII\n\n.\n\n~\n\n..\n\'"\n~\n\n0;\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n:I:\n\n,\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n]\n\n~\n\nIJ..\n\ne\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-15\n\n15\n\n-20\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\nTIME (seconds)\n\nFigure 3-14:\n\n..\n\n20\n\n40\n\n45\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\nTIME (seconds)\n\nTime Histories for Pilot B\n31\n\n..\n\n45\n\n1. A stick-rate time history was constructed by computing. at each simulation sample interval. the\nfirst-difference of the stick time history divided by the simulation interval.\n\n2. The stick-rate time history was smoothed with a rectangular window of 0.16 seconds. This smoothing\nwindow was increased from the 0.08 seconds used previously for plotting to minimize the effects of\namplitude quantization on the recorded stick signal.\n3. The smoothed signal was adjusted for the estimated mean and was normalized with respect to the\nestimated standard deviation to produce a normalized" z" variate. To minimize the effects of potential\n"outliers", the median was used as the estimated mean, and the standard deviation was estimated from\nthe first and third quartile boundaries.\n4. The amplitude distribution function was computed for the z variate at intervals of 0.2 for z values\nbetween -2.0 and 2.0.\n5. A Kolgomorov-Smimov (K-S) test was performed to determine the significance of the difference\nbetween the computed and theoretical normal distribution functions.\n6. The probability density function was estimated from the distribution function as follows:\nPDENS(Z)\n\n= CORR(Z)*(PDIST(Z+.2)-PDIST(Z-.2\xc2\xbb/O.4\n\nwhere PDIST is the cumulative distribution computed at Z intervals of 0.2 between -2.0 and 2.0, and\nCORR(Z) is the correction factor, computed as the ratio of the probability density of the normal curve\ndivided by the density estimated from the normal distribution function according to the rule shown\nabove. Because of "end effects", the probability density function was computed for z values between\n-1.8 and +1.8.\n7. The rms difference between the computed probability density and the theoretically normal probability\ndensity was computed to provide a quantitative measure the deviation of the computed probability\ndensity from normality.\nThe above computations were performed on three time time histories, one for each of the test pilots. To\n\nprovide a basis for comparison, identical analysis was performed on time histories obtained from the simulation\nmodel using the experimental forcing functions tracked by Pilots A and B.\nFigure 3-15 shows that the simulated stick-rare time histories are nearly Gaussian. This subjective conclusion\nis confinned by the first two rows of Table 3-3, which show no statistically significant deviation (Le., alpha level>\n0.05) from normality for the curve in Figure 3-15a and a marginally significant difference for the curve of Figure\n3-15b. Thus, if the test pilots are linear but noisy responders as assumed in the OCM, we would expect the\nexperimental stick-rate time histories to be nearly Gaussian.\nFigure 3-16 shows that probability densities computed from the experimental results were less Gaussian than\nthose computed from the model results. Furthermore, the deviation from normality was substantially less for the\nbest-performing pilot (Pilot A) than for the other two pilots; this observation is confirmed by the rms deviations\nshown in the bottom three rows of Table 3-3.\n\n32\n\nTable 3-3: Amplitude Statistics for Stick Rate\nPilot\nA (simulated)\nB (simulated)\nA (experimental)\nB (experi.mental)\nC (experi.mental)\n\nAlpha Level.\n\n0.017\n0.022\n0.028\n0.058\n0.054\n\n0.05\n0.05\n0.01\n0.01\n\nAlpha significance level determined from K-s test.\nRMS indicates deviation of the probability density from the normal\ncurve.\n\nFigures 3-16a and 3-16c show trends consistent with a move-and-wait tendency in that the probability density\nis more peaked than the normal curve. This trend is particularly pronounced for Pilot C. The interpretation of the\nresults for Pilot B is less clear; the curve suggests that this pilot tended to let his control input slowly drift during the\nintervals between significant control movements.\n\nBecause of the limited database explored. conclusions drawn from the foregoing analysis must be considered\ntentative at this stage. The results suggest the following trends:\n1. Better-performing subjects. in terms of rms error minimization, tend to adopt a response strategy that\n\nis more nearly linear than subjects who perform less well.\n2. Nonlinearities present in the operator\'s response strategy include move-and-wait episodes during\nwhich the operator maintains a relatively constant control force.\nAdditional study is needed to determine the extent to which these tentative conclusions can be generalized.\n\n33\n\nPilot A\n\na)\n\nPilot B\n\nb)\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\n~\n\nen\nZ\nw\n\n0\n\n~\n\n:J\n\nCD\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\n~\nU5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nZ\n\nw\n\n0.4\n\n..,\n\n0.3\n\nCD\n0 0.2\n\n:J\n\n~\n\n.....\n\n"0\n\n0.4\n\nCD\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.3\n\n8\nc:\n\nu\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n<C\n\n0\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.2\n\n<C\n\nc:\na.\n\na.\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n-2\n\n-I\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n-2\n\nZ\n\n-I\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nFigure 3-15: Probability Densities for Simulated Stick Rate\n\n34\n\n2\n\n~)\n\nPilot A\n\nb)\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n~\n\n~\n\nCi5\nZ\n\n0.5\n\n~\n:::;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.4\n\nCD\n\n0.3\n\nc:(\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOJ\n\n0\n\na:\na.\n\nCi5\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nW\n\n0\n\nPilot B\n\nZ\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n~\n:::;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\n"0\nu\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.4\n\nCD\n\n...\n\'"\n\n0.3\n\nc:(\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOJ\n\n0\n\na:\na.\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.0\n-1\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n2\n\nPilot C\n0.7\n0.6\n\n~\n\n0.5\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.4\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nZ\n\nW\n\n0\n\n~\n\n:::;\nCD\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nca\n\na:\na.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n...\n...\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n"\nu\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.0\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nCi5\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-2\n\nc)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nW\n\n2\n\nZ\n\nFigure 3-16: Probability Densities for Experimental Stick Rate\n\n35\n\n2\n\n36\n\n4. Discussion\nTo the extent that tracking error was analyzed by BBN, the trends predicted by pre-experiment model analysis\nwere largely confinned by the experimental study and replicated by post-experiment model analysis. Specifically,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Addition of 180 msec delay to the flight-control system caused a modest increase (around 22%) in rms\ntracking error.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Delay had a larger effect on perfonnance with the simulated "F-16" than with the simulated "C-141".\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Error scores were, on the average, larger in the ground-based simulations than in the in-flight\nsimUlations, but ground/flight differences were relatively small (about 10% on the average).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Perfonnance trends were similar for the pitch and roll axes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The model, "calibrated" for the reference conditions in pitch and roll, replicated the important\nperfonnance trends, but tended to somewhat underestimate the quantitative effects of delay and\nsimulator mode.\nThe reader should note that all model results shown in this report were obtained with but two sets of model\n\nparameters: one set adjusted to jointly match roll-axis performance for the "F-16" and "C-141" in the single-axis,\nground-based, zero-delay, target-tracking task, and one set adjusted to match pitCh-axis perfonnance.\n\nThe major discrepancy between experimental and model results concerned the differences between single-task\n\nand combined-task perfonnance, where the predicted differences were substantially greater than those observed in\nmost cases. As suggested earlier, we suspect this discrepancy was due largely to an error in modeling strategy.\nRecall that the "single-axis" tasks required the pilot to control the airplane in both pitCh and roll in response to an\nexternal target input in only one axis.\n\nWe modeled this situation by selecting observation noise parameters\n\nappropri:ite to true single-axis tracking (i.e., aircraft motion allowed in only one axis), and then accommodating the\ncombined-axis task by doubling the observation noise/signal ratio to reflect an even split of attention between the\ntwo axes. With the advantage of hindsight, a better strategy would seem to be to assume that the pilot must share\nattention in a near-equal manner between the two axes whenever the two axes must be controlled, even if there is an\nexplicit input in only one axis, as the cross-coupling induced by the pilot and/or the vehicle dynamics will\neffectively provide inputs in both axes.\nIt seems clear that selecting observation noise/signal ratios appropriate to combined-axis tracking for the\nso-called "single-axis" tasks would have allowed us to match the experimental results with "residual nose" levels\ncloser to what would be associated with reasonable indifference thresholds. (Contract resources did not pennit a\nrepeat of the model analysis to test this hypothesis.)\n\n37\n\nOn the basis of the results to date, we tentatively conclude that the OCM, properly calibrated, has the potential\nfor interpolating the results of manned simulation studies for the type of steady-state flight tasks explored in the\nNT-33A experimental study. Although we have found the OCM to forecast performance trends with independent\nparameters selected entirely on the basis of previous results, we expect model application to be most reliable when\nthe model is applied in conjunction with a manned simulation study, with parameters selected to match key\nreference conditions. Calibration against the specific data base will allow consideration factors specific to the\nsimulation study, such as (1) the performance goals, motivation levels, and general piloting techniques of the\nspecific test pilots; (2) the nature and amount of task-specific training received by the test pilots, and (3) other\nfactors that account for the difference between laboratory tracking studies using over-trained college or high-school\nstudents and simulation studies using actual pilots performing representative flight tasks under constraints often\navoided in the laboratory.\nTentative rules for calibrating the model are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Calibrate the model against the extreme conditions explored in the simulation study (e.g., widest- and\nnarrowest-band vehicle dynamics, smallest and largest delay common to all vehicles, etc.).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Adopt attention-related parameters appropriate to the number of axes controlled -- not to the number of\naxes containing external inputs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Where control-gains are not optimized for aggressive operations, test for the need of a specific penalty\non control force to model the pilot\'s reluctance to generate large average control forces.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Select residual noise parameters to reflect, at a minimum, perceptual resolution limitations and the\npilot\'s lack of concern about reducing errors below some acceptable minimum.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In general, follow the model-matching procedure described in Section 2.2 of this report.\nThe following areas of further study are suggested to develop and validate an integrated experimental and\n\nanalyti:al method for determining simulator delay requirements:\n1. Validate the Interpolative Capabilities of the Model. If the OCM is to be the analytic component of an\nexperimental/analytic technique for exploring delay requirements, it must be shown capable of reliably\ninterpolating between the conditions for which it is calibrated. The recent NT-33A simulation study\nhas provided a data base suitable for a first test of model interpolation, as it contains data from two\nadditional sets of aircraft dynamics (the "C-IT\' and "C-2I" data), plus three additional time delays for\neach of these configurations. In addition, extrapolation from the target-tracking to the gust-disturbance\ntasks remains to be accomplished. This task, then, would not require additional manned simulations.\n2. Extend OCM to Handling Qualities Predictions. Although this report has dealt entirely with objective\nperformance metrics, the NT-33A data base also includes the traditional Cooper-Harper handling\nqualities metrics for each experimental condition. To the extent that pilot opinion will be considered\nan important indicator of simulator effectiveness, the utility of the OCM will be enhanced if it can\ninterpolate handling qualities as well as performance data. We therefore suggest that an effort be made\nto explore a consistent method of model application that will mimic the NT-33A handling qualities\ndata. This effort would build upon previous model applications in this area (Levison and Rickard,\n1981).\n\n38\n\n3. Validate Experimental/Analytic Methodology. TItis task provides a demonstration of the combined\nexperimental and analytic methods for exploring time delay requirements. We suggest that the\nextrapolative capabilities of the method be tested via model analysis and manned simulation studies of\ntasks other than the attitude-tracking tasks explored in the recent Calspan program. Future studies\nshould include tasks that require path as well as attitude regulation: landing approach, in-flight\nrefueling, and terrain-following are potential candidates.\n4. Explore Criteria for Temporal\xc2\xb7 Fidelity Requirements. The discussion so far has dealt with\nmeasurement and prediction of the influence of delay on objective and subjective performance. but it\nhas not directly addressed the central issue of how much simulator delay (more generally, temporal\ndistortion) can be tolerated in a given simulator application. This study area would most likely involve\na significant manned simulation component, particularly if training transfer were to be explored;\ninnovative modeling approaches might also be required. One possible approach to this task would be\nto develop a backward chaining of requirements, where we proceed from requirements in terms of the\nsimulator application (e.g., the tolerable increments in training time), to requirements in terms of\nobjective performance measures and pilot ratings, to requirements in terms of allowable delays.\n\n39\n\n40\n\n1.

Abstract\n\nThis study explored application of a closed-loop pilot/simulator model to the\nanalysis of some simulator fidelity issues. The model was applied to two data\nbases (1) a NASA ground-based simulation of an air-to-air tracking task in which\nnon-visual cuing devices were explored, and (2) a ground-based and in-flight\nstudy performed by the Cal span Corporation to explore the effects of simulator\ndelay on attitude-tracking performance. The model predicted the major performance\ntrends obtained in both studies. A combined analytical and experimental procedure\nfor exploring simulator fidelity issues is outlined.\n\n17.
