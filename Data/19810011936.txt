Study of both the response\nand the input identification problems led to the development of a\ncomputer program which requires as input only the modal parameters\nof the structure (natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damning\nratius)-and appropriate excitation or response spectra. This\napproach is ideally suited to be coupled with a finite element\nprogram.\nThis study included both analytical and experimental work,\nand it is useful to emphasize the inherent contrast between these\ntwo approaches. In the theory-based analytical phase of this\nstudy, questions were first posed and then answered by the analyst,\n\n1\n\nK.\n\nwhereas in the experimental phase, the questions were posed by the\nexperimental data itself. The experimenter was then challenged to\nfind answers to questions which were often unanticipated. The reporting of this study has fallen naturally into two parts, one\nwhich describes the theory based approach and the other which describes the experimental reality.\n\n2\n\n2.0 Symbol List\nEnglish\n\nGreek\n\na\t\n\nFourier transformed input\nacceleration vector\n\nS\t\n\nA\t\n\ncross section area of\nacoustic transmission line\n\nc\t\n\nspeed of sound in I.ir\n\nC\t\n\ndamping matrix\n\ny 2\t\nr\t\n\nfrequency ratio w/w ;

The\ninherent computational complexity of dealing with many variables\nwhich are both dynamically and statistically coupled often means\nthat for real engineering structures the level of detail is\nlimited by cost.\nAt present solutions to the response problem use either the\nclassic transfer function approach or the non-classical method\nof statistical energy analysis (SEA), I Broadly speaking, classical methods which use continuous system models\n\noffer excellent\n\nspatial and frequency resolution but are limited to highly idealized\nstructures with simplified boundary conditions. Classical methods\nbased nn finite system models can handle more realistic engineering\nstructures but the cost limit on the number of degrees of freedom\nin turn limits spatial resolution and frequency bandwidth.\nFinally, the SEA method offers wide-band frequency estimates at\nthe expense of reduced spatial detail caused by the crude averaging\nof the spatial modes of response.\nThis study uses the classical approach on a finite system\nmodel. It is assumed treat the system is known in terms of its\nnatural modes znd frequencies from either existing analytical solutions or\n\n8\n\n\t\n\nfrom a finite element program. Dampit \xe2\x96\xba g ratio assumptions are\nmade separately based on ex-crimentai data. An efficient computational strateny called Pro g ram RAND is then developed to\nperform both dynamic response an d input identification calculations for a multi-degree-of-free^ci.; (MDOF) structure subjected\nto statistically coupled pressure and base excitation.\n4.2 Development of Program RAND\n4.2.1 Analysis\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two steps. First, it is necessary\n\ntc perform a. signal anal:\'sis, i.e., to trace the ef\';, ct of the\ninput vector through the structure to the resulting output response vector. Next, a stjO stical analysis is made to determine\nthe spice and time correlations between the input and ,output\nvectors.\nConsider first the case of a continuous structure excited\n\nby a force process which is random +y distributed in space and\n;,iine. The structur\'L is divided into n di:,crete elements.

Such a reduction is warranted, for instance, whenever a mode does not significantly contribute energy\nto the ovt ., response. So the matrices M, C, and K are of order\n(m x m), and U is of order (n x m).\nSince each mode is governed by a scalar equivalent to the\nmatrix equation (4-2), a modal transfer function can be obtained by\nFourier transformation for each modal coordinate. For instance,\nfor the p th mode\n\t\nqp =\nwhere Q s\'p =\n\nQP\n\n(4-3)\nQ S IP HP(W)\n\n/MP is the specific modal force. When all the mode\n\nresponse amplitudes are known the modal response vector q must be\ntransformed back to the physical space vector y by the transformation (4-1).\nAll of the preceding signal operations that are required to\nrelate the vectors f and y can be summarized in the signal vector\nblock diagram shown in Figure 4-1.\n\nf\t\n\nC\n\nFig. 4-1\t\n\n\t\nUHM U\n__-\n\nY\n\nForcc. input Transfer Hatr\xe2\x80\xa2ix\n\ni\n\n10\n\nThis diagram uses the convention that the output vector is obtained\nby premultiplying the input vector by the transfer matrix. The\nmatrix RI(w) is a diagonal modal transfer function matrix consisting\nof the individual transfer functions H p (w). The physical-space\ntransfer matrix H\n\nis seen to be related to the modal-space transfer\n\nmatrix by the equation\nH\n\n= U H M U T\t(4-4)\n\nNext the statistical relations which correspond to the signal\nvector block diagram can be determined by Fourier transforming\nrelated time domain correlation matrices. For instance, to the\nreal coordinate transformation y = Uq there corresponds the frequency domain power spectrum relation\nGy (w) = UG q (w) U T\t(4-5)\nand where the elements of G refer to the one-sided spectra customarily used in engineering calculations, and the sin\n\ng le subscripts\n\ny and q refer to the y and q vector processes, respectively. This\nsimple notation has been used rather than the more customary\ndouble subscript notation in order to avoid confusion later when\nmore than one input vector process contribute to the overall response. For the complex transformation q = H(w) Q s the statistical\nrelation is\nGg(w) = 11\t\n\nG\n\n(w) HT (W)\t\n\n(4-6)\n\ns\n\nwhere the (*) denotes the complex conjugate. All the other transfo rnrations implied by the matrix products in equation (4-4) are\nreal, and they will each have a power spectrum relation similar\n\nto equation (4-5) . The over^il l power spectrur,i relation bet,ti , een the\n\n11\n\ninput vector process f and the output process vector % is then\n-1\n*= 1\t\nGy = U H M U\'G fU M H U T\t(4-7)\nwhere the indication of the dependence on the freq , jency w has been\ndropped and the substitutions M -T = M-1 and H T = N have been\nmade. From an operational point of view the response spectrum\nmatrix in equation (4-7) is obtained in the same manner as in equation (4-6): that is, by premultiplying the input spectrum matrix\nby the conjugate transfer matrix H\n\nand post-multiplying by the\n\ntransposed transfer matrix 11 TT.\nThe above procedure of first developing the vector signal\nblock diagram and then drawing out the corresponding power relations provides a powerful and convenient operational tool for\nmore complicated processes. As a second example, consider the\nresponse of a continuous :structure to a base input which is uniform\nspatially but random in time. The vector signal relation between\na, the Fourier transform of the base input acceleration vector\nx(t),and the Fourier transformed absolute displacement response\nvector Y has the block diagram representation shown in Figure 4-2.\nTaken as a whole, the transformations in Figure 4-2 constitute\n\n-U (H + - - I) M U T M\t\nw2\n\nFig. 4-2\t\n\nCase In ,ut Transfer Matrix\n\n12\n\nY\n\nthe physical-space transfer matrix\n-1\nT\nN 1\tU(H + ^ I) M \t u M\t\nW\n\n(4-8)\n\nto draw out the power relations for this process the same operational approach used in the previous example is followed:\nG y\t\n\nLI(R* +\t 1\n\n-I\t\n\t\nI) M\n\n-1\nU T M G a M LI M (II + 1 ^ I )LI T\t(4-9)\n\nw\t\n\nw^\n\nwhore again matrix transposition has been omitted for the syr \xe2\x96\xba metric\n-1\nmatrices M, M\t\nN.\nAs a third exawplc, the previous two examples are combined\n\n^,y asS.kvinq that the farce excitation and base excitation processes\nact simultaneously oil\n\n\t structure, and further, that they are\n\nstdtiSti;3ll -V coupled. The vector signal block diagram for this\ncase is shown in figure 4-3.\n\nFill. 4-3 Combined Input Vector Processes\n\nTo draw cut the power relations for the process tihown in\n\nf i q ure 4-? the savie operational approach i\' t-ol lowed\npreviou s e,,^m; les.\t\n0011 of\n\nThere is. hoWever,\n\nth the\n\na new flock di,101 , 3m oPeI\'d-\n\nSr1n111111g StAt j StiC all .V Cou p led vectors\t\n\n13\n\na^ wi\n\nroilkilres .l\n\n\t\n\ncorresponding new power relation.

The compact relation of equation (4-10) is more easily\ninterpreted in the expanded form:\n\nGy . = Hf*Gf H f T - H\n\nf* Gfa\n\nHa T - H\n\na * Gaf\n\nH f T + Ha * G H a T\t\n\n(4-11)\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side of equation (4-11) is given by\nequation (4-7); the last term is given by equation (4-9). Each of the\nmiddle two terms, because they represent cross power terms between\ntwo separate vector processes, are non-symmetr y : matrices. They\nare, however, conjugate transpozcs\n\nof\n\neach other, so that their\n\nsum yields a matrix with the Hermitian symmetry required for Gy.\nAs a final example, consider the input identification problem\nf\n\nassociated with the system shown in Figure 4-3. It is assumed that\nt\n\nthe output process and only one of the two statistically coupled\ninput processes are known. For example, imagine that the signal\nvectors y(t) and f(t) are known and are available for statistical\nprocessing but that the spectral matrices G a and G fa associated\nwith the base input process are not known. If the cross process\n\n14\n\nmatrix G fa were known, it would in principle be possible to rearrange\nequation (4-11) and to reconstruct the unknown matrix Ga . As an alternative, since y(t) and f(t) are available, it is possible to compute\nanother cross power matrix G fy .\n\nThe additional information provided\n\nby G fy makes possible the deduction of both G a and G fa .\n\nWe consider\n\nhere only the reconstruction of G a . The strategy for this approach\nis based on the following partitioned cross power relation for the\nsystem shown in Figure 4-3:\n\nGfY = _ f_\n\nGfa\t\n\naf; Ga\t\n\nay\t\n\nT\nHfT\t\n\n(4-12)\n\n-Ha\n\nThe upper matrix equation of equation (4-12) is\n\nGfy = G\n\nH fT - Gfa\n\nHaT\t\n\n( 4 -13)\n\nPremultiply equation (4-13) by Hf and substitute into equation (4-11)\nto obtain\n\nHa* G\n\nH a T = G\n\n+ Hf* G\n\nH fT - (H f* G fy + Gyf HfT )\t\n\nThis equation can be used to determine G\n\n(4-14)\n\nin terms of spectrum\n\nmatrices derivable from the input processes f(t) and the output\nprocess y(t).\nHf*\nIn a similar fashion an equation for\n\nS f H f T can be\n\nobtained:\n\nHf* G\n\nH fT = G\n\n+ Ha* G\n\nHa T + (Ha * G ay Gya Ha T )\t\n\n(4-15)\n\nThis equation can be used to determine G f in terms of spectrum\nmatrices derivable from the input process x and the output process y.\n15\n\nResponse estimation by the use of equation (4-11) and input\nidentification by the use of equations (4-14) and (4-15) appears\n\'\t\n\ndeceptively simple. In fact, the amount of computation and\nmeasurement effort implied by these equations can be quite large.\nThe questions of computational strategy and efficiency are taken\nup in the next section.\n4.2.2 Computational Strategies and Efficiency:\nProgram RAND is designed to efficiently compute power\nspectral density (PSD) and intearated power spectral density\n(IPSD) for two modes of operation: a forward (i.e., response)\nanalysis and a backward (i.e., input identification) analysis.\nA basic, program strategy is that the major portion of the computations are performed in a reduced modal space. The modal space\nis determined by examining the modal power participation\nmatrices (described below) and selecting only those modes which\nactively generate significant response power. In general, the\nnumber of active modes m is less than the number of original\nphysical degrees of freedom n, and the original system equations\nare reduced to a smaller and simpler uncoupled set.\nFurther program efficiency is obtained by segregating the\nreal and imaginary parts of complex matrices in such a way that\ncomplex matrix multiplication is replaced by a real dyadic\noperation called an overlay multiplication. Another program\neff4-iency is provided which allows the user to spatially window\na specific node in the system and to determine the power spectrum\nor integrated power spectrum for that node alone in all forward\nor backward modes of operation, thereby reducing computation as\nwell as printout.\n16\n\n4.2.3 tlethod of Response Computation;\nEquation (4-11) can be recast into a compact notation as\n\t\n\n(4-i6)\n\nG r = G r/f + G r/a - Gr/fa\n\nwhere the "r" subscript implies the response variable which can\nbe displacement (y), velocity (, ), and acceleration (y). The "/"\nsymbol denotes "the response with respect to"; f implies force\ninput, a the acceleration input, and fa, the cross power between\nthe force and base inputs. Therefore, G r/f is the partial response PSD due to a force input only; G r/a is the partial response\nPSD for base acceleration only, and\n\nGr/fa\n\nis the partial response\n\ndue to the cross PSD between the two random input processes. G\n\t\nis the total response power and could be written as\n\n^a\n\n:I\n\t\n\n(4-17)\n\nG = G r/f, a, fa\n\nAs indicated earlier, the majority of the operations are performed\nin modal space. The transformation from modal space to the physical\ndomain is performed by the operation\n\nGr, = uGru T\t(4-18)\nwhere the tsar over the response PSD denotes a modal quantity.\nTherefore, equation (4-16) can be reformed into a nodal expression\nas\nGr, - G\n\n\t\nr/f + Ur/a - ^ /fa\n\n(4-19)\n\nThe input power spectra are assumed to be separable in time and\nspace; therefore, the partial power spectra become\n\t\n\n(4-20)\n\nG = G \t D\n\n17\n\nwhere D is a matrix which describes the spatial correlation between\nthe response degrees of freedom or the two random input processes.\nThe modal partial PSO in equation (4-19) can be written as\n\n*6r/t = G f (w) Rf* Df AfT\n\n\t\n\n(4-21)\n\n*\xe2\x80\x94\n\t\na T\n^ /a = G a (w) H a Da 2)\n(4-2\n\n-6r/fa = ( Cfa(w)\n\n+ JQ fa ( w)) (y\n\n(lyfa + 151a) HT )\t\n\n(4 - 23)\n\nwhere C fa and Q fa are the coincident and quadrature components of\nthe cross PSD of the force and base inputs, H f = H is the modal\ntransfer function relating modal force to displacement, and\nHa =\n\n11\n\n+ (1/w 2 ) I is the base acceleration modal transfer function.\n\nThe D matrices are modal power participation matrices which\nare used in the response analysis to identify modes which actively\ngenerate significant power. The modal distribution matrices can\nbe expressed as\n\n-1 T\t\n\n-1\n\nD f = R U D f Utt\t\n-1\t\nD a =t1\t\n\nwhere the unbarred\n\n-1\nU T III D a MU 11\t\n\n-1\t\nDfa =\t\n\n(4-24)\n\n-1\nU D fa M U Ff\t\n\n(4-25)\n\n(4-26)\n\nD\'s represent the spatial distribution matrices\n\nin the physical domain. Note that the modal power participation\nmatrices need only be computed once and that they remain constant\nthroughout the problem solution. Also, the complex operations in\nthe above equations are performed using the special overlay\nmultiplications.\n\n18\n\nThe.complete output information for every degree of freedom\nis not always needed. In that case the response matrix can be\nspatially winJowed at a selected node i. This process will produce\nonly the real co-power term since the quad-power term for a main\ndiagonal element is always zero. A row matrix can be formed by\npartitioning the i\n\nth\n\nrow from the modal matrix and designating\n\nit as pi. The scalar power at node i then becomes\n\nG\n\n= p i Gr p i\t(4-21)\n\nwhere the su p erscript i indicates that a windowing process has\nbeen imposed on the physical PSD matrix.\nThe integrated PSD is obtained by an Euler integration process applied to matrices in modal space. This scheme was selected\nsince it only requires the PSD matrices at step w k , thereby avoiding\nthe difficulties of saving previously evaluated matrices for inte-\n\nyratiun. Therefore, the integrated PSD is\n\nG(wk) -\n\nG(w k- 1 )\n\n+ G(_ IAw k\n\n(4 - 28)\n\n+ ^"\'k - 11\t\n\nMILTe ( \' ) sYmbol denotes a modal integrated PSD and where\nAW^ = 4\'i:Yl - ^,^ is the new step, and aw\n\nulv\n\nk-\n\n1\n\n- wk\n\n-\n\nwk -\n\n1 is the\n\nstep.\n\nThe rat ` at which the program steps through frequency solution is detervined automatically by the program which uses\nthe half po^vvr width of the nearest mode as its basic step in\n\n1"\n\nfrequency. In order to ensure convergence or to improve accuracy,\nthe program allows for subdividing steps and/or concentrating\ncomputations at selected modes of importance.\n4.2.4 Method of Input Identification Computations:\nThe general problem of identifying a spatially non-uniform\ninput process is very complex both computationally and experimentally. A reasonable level of complexity can be obtained by\nassuming both force and base acceleration input distributions\nare spatially uniform. Therefore, D\n\nand D a are set to a one\n\nmatrix and the input identification process is performed at a\nsingle nodal point on the structure which would correspond to\nan experimental accelerometer output.\nTo estimate the base acceleration input PSD, equation (4-14)\ncan be written as\n\nGr/a - Gr/f,a,fa + Gr/f - Gfr/f,a,fa\t\n\n(4-29)\n\nwhere Gr,/a is the partial power response due to the input base\n\nacceleration, to be identified,\nGfa is the total response of the system due to\nall effects,\nG r, / , is the partial response due to the uniform force\ninput PSD,\nGfr/f,a,fa i\n\nn s the cross power between the input force\n\n(SD and the response of the system due all\n\neffects.\n\nAs discussed previously, it is not reasonable to require an experiment to produce all the data required to specify equation (4-29)\n\n^G\n\ncompletely. Therefore, the windowing process must be applied to\nreduce equation (4-29) to\ni\t\nGr\n\ni\t\nGr J l\n\ni\t\ni\t\nG\n+ r/f - Gfr\n\n(4-30)\n\nNote that the subscripts to the first and third terms have been\n\ndropped since they are the responses due to all effects. Equation\n(4-30) implies the following:\n\nG\n\n\t the accelerometer response at nodal position 1\n\nGr/f is the input force PSD at nodal position i which\nby assumption is the same at any node\nGis the cross PSD information between the input\nfr force PSD and the output accelerometer at node i.\nThis PSD contains a coincident and quadrature component.\n\nTo deLer;rnine an estimate of the input base acceleration PSD,\nthe program applies a white noise PSD to the base in order to\ncharacterize the system power response, denoted as G rua ,. Then\n\nthe base input to node i can be written as\ni\t\n\ni\t\n\ni\n\nG rua = G\' (w) G rCa ,\n\n(4-31)\n\nwhere G;(w) is the identified base input acceleration PSD obtained\nd\n\nfrow information at node i. Solving for Ga using equations (4-30)\nand (4-\'31) produces\ni\nUa (wl\n\n- i \xe2\x80\x94 ( G r\xe2\x80\xa2 + G\n- Gfr)\nr/f\n\n(4-32)\n\nGrad,\n\nIn a similar fash-;on, equation (4-15) can be windowed at node\nt\ni as\n\ni\t\n\nL`1\n\nii\t\n\nf = C;r,\t\n\nGr\xe2\x80\xa2r\'a\nv\n\n1\n\nd\n\ni\nGar\n\nt4-33)\n\nwhere Ga r is the cross PSO between the base acceleration and\naccelerometer output as node i.

Originally the exact analytical solution for this case was\ndeveloped to rigorously check the program logic of RAND. However,\nsince the simple oscillator is a prototype for each of\nthe modes of a MDOF system, the analytical solution gives valuable\ninsight into the convergence and resolution properties of the\ndiscrete frequency operations of RAND.\nFor example, consider the acceleration response of a one DOF\nsystem of mass m, natural f-equency w n , and damping ratio c. For\nthe combined force and base excitations characterized by the\nspectra\n\nG f (w),\n\nG ( . ,I), and\n\nGy (^) =\t\n\nC fa 11w) +\n\nRfa(w) the response is\n\nl\n(1-^ 2 ) + (2cti)2\nG\t\n\n2 C\t\n\nQfa\t\n\n2 t -TF - Z \xe2\x80\x94\n\nX v4\nt^\n\n+ (1 + 4^ 2 b2 ) Ga(w)\n\n(4-35)\n\nwhere s = w/w n . The term which contains C fa , the coincident\n\ncw"-\n\nnent of the cross power, appears with a rcgative sign. This reflects\nthe fact that the separate responses to the force and to the base\ninputs are in opposi*inn to each other. In contrast, the term\nwhich contains Q fal t he quadrature component of the cross power,\n\nappears with a positive sign and has a smaller magnitude than the\nCfa term, at least for 2{a < 1. For the case where the input spectra\nare constant with frequency the integrated mean squared acceleration\n\nresponse is\n\t\n\n4;2\n+ n l\t\n\t\nty2> = 1 im Gfwn\t\n--^ 10l0-0.m\n\n2C fa\n\nJ\n\n\t\n\n* 2^ Qma\n`^\t n Rn(1-2(1-2^2)^,^2)_1 +\n\nwn R\nm\n\n,\xe2\x96\xba (\t 1-2 ; )\n\n2r.- 1-^2\n+ G awn\t\n\n^r(1+4c2\n;\n\n(4-36)\n\nThe terms involving A represent the overall output power contributed\nby the resonant portion of the transfer functions. Additional terms\ninvolving o are non-resonant contributions to the output which continue to grow with frequency. Since the resonant contributions\noccur just in the narrow band of frequency at w n , a good estimate\nof the integrated response over a finite bandwidth which includes\nthe resonance can be obtained by dropping the limiting operation\na-,- in equation (4-36;.\nAn idea of the extreme range of the input coupling effect can\nbe obtained by examining the special case where Qfa\nGa\n\n= G\n\nf/m2 = Cfa/m = G\n\n\'g\n\nand\n\n0 . This corresponds to the case where the\n\nforce and base inputs are fully coherent and the resonant contri23\n\nbutions of the two input spectra are nearly equal. Substitution into\nequation.(4-36) yields, for the finite upper frequency ratio R,\n\n< Y2>\n\nx\n\nGOY\n\n\t\n\n(4-37)\n\nThus the resonant contributions cancel each other and only the\nnon-resonant response remains. By changing the phase . of the copower term, C fa/m = -G0 , the overall response becomes\n\n< Y2 > = G Oan (s +)\t\n\n(4-38)\n\nwhere the power contribution due to resonance is four times that\ncaused by G\n\nor Ga alone. Figure 4-4 shows the results of a RAND\n\ncomputation for a related extreme case where Q fa t 0. The phase\nbetween the base and force input is described by the phase angle\n^ = tan 1 (Qfa/Cfa)\'\nIn summary, the resonant power response ranges from near zero\n(coherent signals cancel), up through a factor of two (simple sum\nof ancorrelated powers) to a maximum of four (coherent signals add\nfor a signal factor of two, a power factor of four). Note that\nthis range will be reduced whenever the inputs are not equal or\nare not fully coherent. It is clear that the effect of coherence\nand phase of the cross power can be very significant. Similar\neffec- are apparent in t1DOF system responses, to be discussed later.\nts\n4.3.2 Acoustic Excitation of a Beam\nA simple ten degree-of-freedom beam was chosen to investigate\nthe effects of the spatial correlation of the acoustic input and\nthe effects of the beam boundary conditions.

All inputs are constant with.frequency (white noise) and no correlation exists\nbetween the base or acoustic inputs. It is evident that the\nasymetric modes (every other mode) do not participate in the\nresponse when the pressure is spatially correlated. Participation is strong for these modes, however, when the pressure is\nspatially uncorrelated. The area under the uncorrelated curve\nis, therefore, larger than that under the uncorrelated curve,\nresulting in a higher integrated response for the uncorrelated\ncase.\nFigure 4-6 shows the effect of boundary conditions on the integrated acceleration power response. The solid line represents\nsimple supports while the dashed line represents clamped supports.\nThe discrete jumps in the curves occur every time that a participating mode is passed. Since the simply supported beam has the\nlowest natural frequency, its response starts to build first.\nThe two curves then alternate in height for a time until the\nclamped curve finally begins to maintain a higher integrated\nvalue than the simply supported curve. These results indicate\nthat stiffer boundary conditions will give a somewhat higher\nintegrated response, but it is felt that this will not be a major\nvariable in response or input prediction.\nFigure 4-7 shows a family of backbone curves for integrated\nresponse of the beam center node versus phase angle\t\n\ntan- 1(Co/Qd)\n\nof the cross power between the base and spatially uniform acoustic\n\n27\n\n10 3\n\nSIMPLE SUPPORTS\nCLAMPED\n1d\n\na r\n\nN 10,\n\n--^M\nN\nN\n\n103\nat\n\nW\n\nP\nW\nH\nQ\nc7 102\n\nW\nH\nZ\n\ntot\n\n100\n\nJu\t\n\nFREQUENCY, (rad/sec)\n\n100\n\nFig. 4-6 Effect of Boundary Conditions on Integrated\nResponse Power of Beam\n\n28\n\n1000\n\nCOHERENCE - 1.0 : \'\n10,000\n\n.75\n\nSIMPLE SUPPORTS\n--CLAMPED\n.5\n\n9000\n\n.25\n\n8000\n\nC\'-\n\nN\n\n1.0\n\n7000\n\n.75\nc\ncc\n\n.5\n\n3 6000\n\n2\nZ\n\n.25\n\nO\n\nd 5000\nQ\n\nW\nJ\nW\n\nU\n\nU\n\nd\n\np\n\nW\n\nl^\n\n4000\n\nd\ncc\nC7\n\nW\nz 3000\n\n2000\n\nNOTE: BACKBONE CURVES\nARE SHOWN ONLY\n\n1000\n\n0\n0\t\n\n20\t\n\n4U\t\n\n60\t\n\n80\t\n\n100\t\n\n120\t\n\n140\t\n\n160\t\n\ni\n\nPHASE ANGLE, #, degrees\n\nFig. 4-7 Integrated Response Power of Beam vs.\nCross PSD Phase and Coherence\n29\n\n180\n\ninputs, for two support conditions.

Figure 4-1 demonstrates the substantial\neffect that statistical coupling between base and acoustic inputs\ncan have on the random response of structures. Similar effects\nwill be demonstrated for a plate (Section 4.3.4).\n4.3.3 Single Point Force Excitation of a Plate\nDuring the development of RAND a number of solutions were\nrun and comparisons made with existing analytical solutions in\norder to verify Program RAND. For example, RAND results were\ncompared with an analytical solution by Wittig f3) for the mean\nsquare velocity of a rectangular, simply supported plate subjected\nto a random point force having a white noise input spectrum. The\nresults of this comparison are shown in Figure 4-8. The RAND\nsolution utilizes only sixteen degrees of freedom and therefore\naccounts for a very small portion of the.modes included in the\nanalytical solution. Still, however, convergence is rapid and\nthe two solutions are in good agreement. The question of convergence i.s discussed further in the next section.\n4.3.4 Combined Base and Acoustic Excitation of a Plate\nNext we consider in more detail a plate response problem\nwhere the excitation is more realistic than in the previous\nexample. For this example an aluminum plate is chosen which measures\n4 ft. by 3 ft., with a thickness of 0.2 in. This thickness is\nchosen to insure a fundamental frequency low enough to be affected\nby the low end of the input spectra. she plate is assumed to be\n\nsimply supported on all four edges. hodal damping is assigned a\n3U\n\n\t\n\n+\n\nr so\t\n\n+ 143 + 142 + 97\n\n87\t\n+ 55\t\n52\n\n36\xe2\x80\x9e\t\n\ni48\t\n+\n\n73\n\n\t\n\n^5\n, -\n\n50\t\n+ 52\t\n}\n\n80\t\n87\t\n\n\'^\xe2\x80\xa24\t\n\n148\t\n+\n\n78\n\n97\n+\n\n47\n\n78\t\n\n75\t\n+\n\n82\n\n52\n\n77\t\n*\n\n78\n\n55\n+\n\n52\n\n+ 144 } 143 + 97\n146\t\n\n0 RAND PROGRAM\n\n146\t\n\n97\n\nSEPARABLE SUM SOLUTION\n\nLOCATION OF RANDOM\nPOINT LOAD\n+ LOCATIONS OF MEAN SQUARE\nVELOCITY RESPONSE\n\n48"\n\nFig. 4-8 Integrated Velocity Power of Rectangular\nPlate Driven by Random Point Load Input\n\n31\n\n1\n\nvalue of z = .05 for the first mode and assumed to decrease for\nhigher modes so that the product cw n remains constant. Such\na plate has-sixty-four natural frequencies below 1000 Hz. Only\neighteen of these modes participate when Pxcited by either a\nuniform pressure or a base input. The input spectra ranges in\nfrequency from 30 to 1000 Hz as shown in Figure 4-9.\nAt first the base and pressure inputs are assumed to be\nstatistically independent. The integrated displacement responses\nfor these independent inputs, computed separately by RAND, are\nshown in Figure 4-10. Evident from this figure is the fact that\nthe displacement response converges rapidly for both inputs, and\nis almost entirely determined by the first few participating\nmodes. One can conclude from this that any instrumentation (such\nas a strain gage) that relies solely on displacement response for\ninput identification would be completely ineffective at mid and\nhigh frequencies. Because both inputs are spatially uniform,\nthe response is symmetric and the largest response occurs at\nthe center of the plate. The magnitude of the integrated RMS\nresponse due to both inputs is 0.115 in., or approximately onehalf of the plate thickness,\nThe integrated acceleration responses for independent pressure\nand base inputs are shown in Figure 4-11. They exhibit an entirely\ndifferent character than the displacement responses in that convergence is not evident. The integrated response increases a\ntittle as each participating mode is encountered. Acceleration\nresponse data is clearly preferable to displacement response data\n\n32\n\n10\'5\n\n0.1\n\n(psi)2/Hz\n\nq2/Hz\n\n10\'8\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n100\n\n10\n\n\t\n\n10\'7\n1000\n\nFREQUENCY, Hz\n\nFig. 4-9 Combined Base and Acoustic Excitations for Plate\n\n33\n\nC 4is C\n\nN\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-\n\nO^ W O\t\nax IL aC\n^!j^ x\nt0 W ul\nO Co d O\n\nL ^\n\n1\n\n^ N\n7\nd O\nAa\na42\n\n1\nO A\n\nV\n2\nW\n\nL N\n\nO\nW\n\nN M\nC\n\nQ\nW\n\nti A\n\np\nO^\n\n\' C\nCL ^-+\n_N\n\nOr\n^\nA\n\nI\n\ni O\n\nI\n\na) 4J\n4J b\n\nCh"\n\nC 4^\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\nO\nr\n\n1\n\n^\t\np\n\nN\n\n^\t\nO\n\nM\n\nb\t\n\n\'o\n\nZ ( u!) -1N3 MVIdSl0 3wvnOS NV3W\n\n34\n\nBASE INPUT\n00 .-- (42092)\n\nN_\n\nPRESSURENPUT\n(250 g^l\n\n1\nC\n\n9\n\nH\nQ\nQ\nW\n\nUj\n\n8\n\n107\n\nQ\n\nW\nQ\nQ\n2\nQ\nW\n2\n\n106\n\t\n20\n\n\t\n100\t\n\n1000\n\n10.000\n\nFREQUENCY, N:\n\nFig. 4-11 Integrated Acceleration Power of Plate for\nStatistically Independent Base and Acoustic Inputs\n\n35\n\nfor the identification of inputs over a wide frequency range. The\nspatial distribution of acceleratioq over the plate (not shown\nhere) is again symmetric, and indicates that the center of the\nplate has a higher response by a factor of almost two over any\nother plate location. This suggests that the center of the plate\nacts as a collector of energy and is, therefore, the best site for\nthe location of an accelerometer.\nThe effect of statistical coupling between the base and\npressure inputs can be investigated using the same plate model\ndescribed above. The base and pressure PSO characteristics\nare chosen to be white noise, their respective power amplitudes\nsized to cause a roughly comparable response of the plate if\napplied separately. Fig. 4-12 shows the integrated acceleration\nresponse at the center node of the plate for several variations\nin cross power phase angle * and for two values of the coherence\nratio (all assumed constant with frequency). Note that the integrated response can range from a low value of 4 g\'s RMS to a high\nof 30 g\'s\'RMS depending on the phase between the base and acoustic\ninputs, a result consistent with the simple oscillator study\ndiscussed earlier in Section 4.3.1 For a phase angle of 90 0 the\nresponse is equal to 22 g\'s RMS. This value is nearly equal to\nthe response that would occur if the two inputs were uncorrelated.\nThis large range of possible responses is directly attributable to\nthe statistical coupling between the base and pressure inputs,\nsince these inputs have remained unchanged in this plate response\nexample. This emphasizes the need to assess the magnitude and\nphase characteristics cf any statistical coupling\n36\n\nbetween inputs.\n\n100\n\nCOHERENCE - 1.0\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\nCOHERENCE - 0.5\nDi = 1.1 x 10\'5 (p6i)2.Ms\nDo n 3.14x 10\'2g2ft\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6 -180 (30 g\'s R.M.S.)\n180 (28 y\'s R.M.S.)\n\n108\n\ncc\nW\n\n90 (22 y\'s R.M.& )\n\n/\nf\n\nz\n2\n\n0 = 0 (12 s R.M.S.)\n\nIII\t\n\ns ^^\n\nQ\nQ\nW\n\nt\n\nJ\nW 107\n\nV\nV\n\n^I\n\n/\t\n\nQ\n\nr\n\n0 = 0 (4 R.M.S.)\n\n106\n20\t\n\n100\t\n\n1000\n\nFREQUENCY, Hs\n\nFig. 4-12 Integrated Acceleration Power of Plate for\nCombined Inputs with Varied Statistical Coupling\n\n37\n\n4.4 Parametric Design Guidelines for Plates Subjected\nto Random Excitation\n\nParametric relationships for plates subjected to random excitation are developed separately for a pressure input and for a\nbase input.

Consider next that the effect of\ns\ndamping and modal participation factor are held constant, and only\nthe plate mass and its natural mode frequencies are varied. The \t\n\nt;\n\nplate mass m is simply\n\nm = pabt\t\n\n(4-41)\n\nwhere a = mass density\n!H\n\na,b = plate length and width\nt = plate thickness\nThe fundamental frequency of the plate is\nwn2 = D\n\t\nx\n\nIV\n\n\t\n\n1 2\nf(a)\n2 + (a)\n\t(4-42)\n2J\nL\n38\n\n3\nwhere D - plate bending stiffness - E tV2).\n\nAs the mass and fundamental frequency of the plate is varied\nso will the mass and the frequency of each higher mode be varied\naccordingly. The total response to all the modes will then be a\nsummation of modal responses, each similar to eqn (4-39) for displacement, or eqn (4-40) for acceleration. Parametric relations\nfor the RMS response of the plate are obtained by substituting\neqns (4-41) and (4-42) into eqns (4-39) and (4-40), and then taking\nthe square root of the resulting expression. These relations are\nshown in Table 4-1. The parameters can be divided into three\ngroups representing the effects of plate geometry, plate material,\nand plate thickness. (n refers to the material loss factor).\nThese groups are represented by the symbols D and A for the displacement and acceleration response respectively, and with the subscripts\nG, M, and t to denote geometry, material and thickness. Figures\n4-13 through 4-17 present plots of the effects of geometry, material\nand thickness on plate response.\nFigures 4-13 and 4-14 show the dependence of the geometric parameters AG and DG on the aspect ratio B of the plate for several\nvalues of the plate width b. Displacement parameter D G decreases\nmonotonically with increasing a. In contrast, acceleration parameter AG reaches a maximum at a = 1.33 and then slowly decays.\nThe effect of material selection on displacement and acceleration\nresponse is shown in Figure 4-15. The displacement and acceleration\nparameters DM and A. each shows a dependence on modulus E and\ndensity p which differs greatly from the modulus-to-density ratio\ncommonly used in the design of precision aerospace instruments.\nAs a result such inexpensive metals as steel and brass\n39\n\n\t\n\nTable 4-1 Parametric Relationships for\nRMS Response of\na e,\n\na2\nAisp.\n\nDG Dm Ot\n\nb2\t\n\n.TI I_\n\nE 3/4 p1/4 t5/2 n\n1/2\t\n\n(a2+b2\t )\t\nPressure\nut\nAcc. \xe2\x80\x94\t\n\n+b2\nE 1/4 a 2\n1/2\t\n2\nn /\t\np\t\na .b\nt\t\n\n_\n\na 2 b2 p3/4\nDisp. -.\nE3/4 t3/2 n1/2\n\n(a 2+b 2 \t\n)\nBase\nInput\n\nAcc.\n\nE1\na\n\n/4 ( a 2 +b 2 1/2\nb\n\np\n\nt1/2\n\nn/2\xe2\x80\x94\n\n40\n\nAG\n\nAM\n1/2\n\nAt\n\n10.0\n\n1 (1 +\nAG `\n\nb3\n\np211/2\n\nP2\n\nT\nb\n\n1.0\n\nb-1\'\n\nAG\n\n10" 1\n\nb=2\'\n\nb=3\'\n\n10-2\n\n0\t\n\n0.5\t\n\n1.0\t\n\n1.5\t\n\n2.0\t\n\n2.5\n\na = alb\n\nFig. 4-13 Effect of Geometry on RMS Plate Displacement\n(Pressure Input)\n41\n\nI\n\ni\nbP2\n\nG (1 \xe2\x99\xa6 p2)3/2\t\n\nT\nb\n\n1.6\n\n1\n^.--- a\t\n\nI\n\n1.4\nb=4\'\n1.2\n\n1. 0\t\n\nb=3\'\n\nOG\n\n0. 8\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 4\n\n0 .2\n\nn\n0.5\t\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\t\n\na\n\'\n\n=b\n\nFig. 4-14 Effect of Geometry on RMS Plate Acceleration\n(Pressure Input)\n42\n\n6.0\nO\t\n\nMa\n\n1\t\n\n.\n\n(E3p)1!4\n\n4.0\nx\n\n2\n\n7\n\n2.0\n\nd\n>\t\n\nJ\nJ\t\n\nz\t\n\nJ\t\nW\t\nW\t\n\niQ\t\n\na\t\n\n0.0\n\nm\t\n\n_>\nZ\n\nc\t\nW\t\nco\n\nH\n\n^.\n\nc\n0\n\nCL\n\nw\n4J\nb\na\n\nN\n\n1.8\nC\nO\n\n)1/4\n\n1.6\n\nAM \'( P5\nE\n4J Q.\n\nc\n\n1.4\nv-\n\n0^\n4JLn\n\n1.2\n\nU {/1\nQ! 0J\n\n4- L\nV- d\nW\n\nto\n\n\xc2\xb0 1.0\nr\nx\n2\n\nLn\nr\ni\n\nv\n\nQ 0.8\n\nrn\n\xe2\x80\xa2r\nLl.\n\n0.6\n0.4\nD\t\n_\n\n0.2\n\nJ\n\n?\t\t\n\nW\t\nN\t\n\nQ\t\nJcr\t\nm\t\nQ\t\n\n0.0\n\n43\n\nD_\n\nJ\n}\t\n\nz\nQ\n\nm\t\n\n~\nH\n\nv\n\nf\n\ncompare favorably with the expensive metal beryllium as far as\nrandom response is concerned.\nFigures 4-16 and 4-17 show the effect of thickness on response.\nThe effect of thickness on displacement response is very pronounced. In contrast, the effect of thickness on the acceleration response is relatively mild.\nAll of the parameter effects described above have been verified by RAND. Typically the response of a particular plate can\nbe determined for a given input. The geometry, thickness and maerial properties can then be changed arbitrarily and the new\nresponse predicted to within a few percent by using the parametric\nrelationships.\nThe development of corresponding parametric relationships\nfor base excitation follow the same approach as for the pressure\ncase. In this development there is one major difference: it\nbecomes evident that one can address either the relative or the\nabsolute plate response. RAND studies show that the majority of\nthe response of a plate to a base input is produced by motion of\nthe plate relative to its supports. Using D\'ALembert\'s Principle,\nthe forcing function for this relative response is proportional\nto the mass per unit area pt. This suggests that the parameters\nfor base response can be obtained from the pressure response\nparameters simply by multiplication of the latter by the factor\nPt, as shown in the bottom half of Table 4-1. Note that only\nthe geometry parameter is unchanged.

As before, the accuracy of these base response\nparameters have been verified by Program RAND.\nThe purpose of this parametric study was to develop the\nr\t\n\nability to predict changes in response due to changes in structural configuration and as a result to be able to predict the\nresponse of a newly designed plate by comparing its physical\ncharacteristics to a plate with a known response. The above\nt\nparametric relationships accomplish this goal.\n4.5 Conclusion to Part I\nProgram RAND is a practical and useful tool for making response and input identification estimates for any multi-degreeof-freedom structure subjected to botn base and acoustic inputs.\nDisplacement response computations, suitable for stress and sway\nspace estimates, converge quickly and require only a low frequency\nrepresentation of the structure. On the other hand, acceleration response computations, suitable for the estimation of g loads\nand for designing subassembly tests, do not converge quickly.\nIn the latter case, the structural model must have good fidelity\nover a bandwidth which includes all frequencies of significant\nexcitation. In the case of an acoustic input this bandwidth may\nextent to 10 KHz.\nPractical limitations to the RAND estimation procedure do\nnot relate to the program itself, but rather to the program inputs.\nThe limited fidelity of the finite element model used to characterize the structure has already been mentioned. A second input\nlimitation, looking ahead to Part II of this study, results from\na\n\n1\t\n\n47\n\nthe difficulty of accurately measuring the random base or acoustic\nexcitations. As far as model fidelity is concerned, perhaps a\nreasonable approach is to use Program RAND for low frequency displacement studies, and for acceleration studies up to mid frequency\nrange. Truly high frequency problems will probably best be studied\nusing the technique of Statistical Energy Analysis. Input accuracy\nlimitations are discussed in part II.\n\n48\n\n5.0 Part II: Ex eriment-Bas\nand InPuten\t\nca o\n5.1 Introduction to Part II\nIn describing the experimental portion of this study a distinction has been wade between low resolution and high resolution experiments. This distinction reflects the historical fact that\noriginally only a low resolution Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyzer was available for use in this study. Subsequently a high\nresolution capability was added to the analyzer. Although the low\nresolution results are in some respects inferior in quality to the\nhigh resolution results, there are advantages and disadvantages\nassociated with both types of measurements. Consequently there\nis much to be learned by contrasting the low and high resolution\nmeasurements, and they have been given equal emphasis in this\nreport.\n5.2 Laboratory Test Description\nA simple schematic of the test set up for combined base and\nacoustic inputs is shown in Figure 5-1. The corresponding instrumentation layout is shown in a more detailed fashion in Figure\n5-2. With this equipment it was possible to excite the plate\nby a base input, by an acoustic input, or by combined base and\nacoustic inputs. Note that in the combined input case both the\nbase and acoustic excitation are caused by the same source,\nnamely the MBT495 Random Noise Generator. This means, of course,\nthat th., base and acoustic inputs are fully correlated statistically, and the nature of the cross power spectral density between\nthese excitations is wholly determined by the frequency transfer\ncharacteristics of the base and acoustic channels which exist\nbetween the noise source and the aluminum plate.\n49\n\n^. rte.\n\n/\n\nSUSPENDED ACOUSTIC CEILING\nRFORATED SHEET METAL)\n0+ %\n\n15" DIAMETER\n\n\'ONSE ACCELEROMETER\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\n\nFIXTURE MOUNTED SHAKER INPUT\nMICROPHONE\n\nACCELEROMETER\n\nALUMINUM PLATE (8" x 12" x.0625")\nPLATE FIXTURE\n\nSHAKER\n\nFig. 5-1 Test Set Up: Combined Base and Acoustic Input\n\n50\n\nQ\n\nW Q\nZ NS\nZ\t\n\n; R\n\nJ^\n\nW\n\nQ\n\nH\n\nIL\n\nW\t\n^\t\n\nt\n\nyQ\nJ\n<\n\nCQ\n\nZm^\n\nW\n\nx\n\n*1\n\nH\n\n^\nJ\n\nW\nd\n\nC$\nQ\n\nW\n\nJQ,\n\nO\n1\n.o\n\nJ\nC\n\nJ\n\nW\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r\n\n^ W\n\nx\n\nJ\t\n\nC\n\nIl\n\n< s\n\nt\n\nN\nC\nN\nQ\nW\nY\nW <\n\ntV\n\nQ\nW\nY\n2\nb\n\nJ iA\nr\n\nQ\nW\n6\n<13\nO z 1\n\nQ\nW\nQ\n\nLij\nK\n\nF H\n\n2\n\nW\n\nN\n\ncc\n\nO\n\nQ\nJW\n\nz^^\nde\ncr\n\n51\n\nLA\n\np1\n\nIn the experiments the procedure was to measure input and response spectra under various conditions of excitation and then to\ncompare these spectra with those predicted by Program RAND. In\norder for RAND to be executed it is necessary to specify the dynamic\nmodal parameters of the plate. The required parameters are the\nmodal damping ratio vector ^, the modal frequency vector f\xe2\x80\xa2and the\nmode shape matrix U. Modal damping ratios can only be determined by\nexperiment, and much effort was expended in this study attempting\nto obtain reliable damping estimates. On the other hand, frequency\nand mode shape estimates can either be made experimentally or by\nthe use of a computer-aided finite element analysis. Probably the\npreferred approach is to determine these parameters wholly by\n\nW\nexperiment, since no idealized assumptions are required as with\nthe finite element modelling process. And with the availability\nof computer-based modal analysis systems the experimental approach\nmay also be easier. Unfortunately in this study no such modal\nana l ysis system was available. Mode shape estimates were therefore\nbased on a finite element analysis using Program SAP IV. Damping\nand frequency data was obtained experimentally.\nThe question of boundary conditions requires special attention.\nThe analytical approach embodied in Program RAND utilizes the principle of linear superposition, and the ideal assumption is made that\na base input, of infinite source impedance, acts independently of\nthe acoustic input, which has zero source impedance. The experimental reality is rather more complex. As will be detailed below\nin the treatment of input loading effects, both the shaker and the\n\n52\n\nloudspeaker possess a finite source impedance. Further, these\ninputs are dynamically coupled: for instance, the base input level,\nas measured by the plate fixture accelerometer will be caused to\nchange merely by turning on the acoustic input. The RAND assumptions\nare still valid and the RAND predictive procedure is still applicable to real structures; it is Just that particular care must be\ntaken concerning boundary conditions in a test situation. Consider\nfor example that we want to compare RAND predictions with experiment\nfor the case of acoustic input only. Since the analytical approach\nassumes infinite source impedance for the base input and, in this\ncase, the base input amplitude is assumed to be zero, the proper\nexperimental procedure is clearly to mechanically block the shaker\ninput. Alternatively, a pure base input test, without any acoustic\ninteraction, would require removing the loudspeaker, or, better yet,\nto remove any acoustic effects by operating in a vacuum. The difficulty with boundary conditions occurs only when it is desired to\ntest one input at a time. Practically speaking, there will always\nbe combined inputs in a field situation, and the RAND procedure\nwill rigorously apply.\nFinally, we consider the question of data averaging. Whereas\nthe analytically derived spectra produced by the RAND predictive\nprocedure have in effect already been averaged mathematically, the\nexperimental data produced by the base input and plate response\naccelerometers and by the microphone vary randomly, and must be\nsufficiently averaged to reduce the amount of statistical variation\nto acceptably small levels. A figure of merit for the adequacy of\n\n53\n\nthis averaging is the confidence level as measured by the equivalent\ndegrees of freedom of the chi-square distribution model of the\nsampling process. Although the question of confidence level was\naddressed in these experiments it was not systematically monitored\nand is not reported on here. A second figure of merit which indicates the quality of data estimates is the coherence ratio. This\nparameter is related to the signal -to-noise ratio of the data, and\nis conveniently available on the FFT Analyzer. It was consistently\nmonitored during all tests. A brief review of the coherence ratio\nfollows.\nA common situation which arises in structural vibration measurement, which we shall refer to as output noise contamination, is\nshown in Figure 5-3.\n\nN(w)\nX(W)\n\n\t\n\nH(w)\t\n\nw(w) +\nY(W)\n\nFigure 5-3 Output Noise Contamination\n\nIn the Fourier domain, a linear dynamical structure, characterized by its transfer function H(w), receives an excitation\n\nX(w)\n\nand responds at a level W(w).

The nominal\nfrequency resolution of the analyzer is then the base bandwidth\n55\n\ndivided by the number of spectral lines provided by the particular\nanalyzer configuration. Nominal resolution for the 400 spectral\nline analyzer (in base band operation) is given in Table 5-1 as\na function of base bandwidth setting.\n\nBase Bandwidth\t\nSetting\t\n\nNominal\nFrequency\nResolution\n\n0 - 500 Hz\t\n\n1.25 Hz\n\n0 - 1000 Hz\t\n\n2.5 Hz\n\n0 - 2000 Hz\t\n\n5\t\n\nHz\n\nTable 5-1 Frequeng Resolution for Baseband Operation\n\n.\nAs an example, low resolution estimates of the quality factor Ql\nof the first plate mode (f1 =240 Hz) varied from 25<Q1<100 depending\non base band setting. The actual Q of the first mode, determined\nlater by using an analyzer with a uigital frequency expansion (Zoom)\ncapability, was about 109. The actual half power bandwidth of the\nfirst mode is therefore about\n\n,U = 2.2 Hz. Clearly none of the\n\nabove base bandwidth settings (Table 5-1) can adequately resolve\nthe sharp resonance peak of the first plate mode.\nTime domain estimates of damping ratio were also attempted.\nThe log decrement of the transient decay envelop of the plate were\nmeasured after passing the plate response signal through a band\npass filter centered at the particular mode frequency of interest.\nDamping estimates were improved by this technique. For example,\nthe first mode quality factor ranged from 76<Q<89. The method\nproved, however, to be tedious and inconvenient. It was also suspect\n56\nu\n\nfrom a theoretical point of view: the plate dynamic characteristics\nwere being windowed by the electronic filter which possessed its\nown dynamic characteristics.\nThe proper estimation of damping is crucial to the success of\nany scheme of structural response or input identification estimation. And proper estimation of damping requires the use of instrumentation which has adequate resolution. It will be shown below\nin this report that there are certain advantages to making low\nresolution measurements of the input and output spectra in structural\ndynamic studies. The requirement of high resolution measurements\nfor damping, however, remains unchanged.\n5.3.2 Excitation and Response Spectra\nTypical examples of low resolution excitation and response\nspectra for the plate are shown in Figure 5-5, for the case of\nbase input, and in Figure 5-6, for the case of acoustic input.\nIn both cases a broad band input excitation extends from nearly\nzero to 2000 Hertz.

Note\nthat a spurious small response peak occurs at approximately 1200\nHz. This was not predicted by the combined SAP/RAND analysis and\nwan not included as a transfer characteristic of the plate in any\nsubsequent RAND response predictions or input identifications.\nAgain, were modal analysis equipment available, this response\ndetail would be routinely incorporated in the plate model representation of Program RAND.\nWe turn now to the question of the quality of these spectra\nestimates. As stated above, the spectra have been sufficiently\naveraged timewise to the point of negligible statistical variation.\nHowever, a plot of the coherence ratio, shown in Figure 6-7, indicates that the signal-to-noise ratio is sharply reduced at a number\nof critical frequencies. In this Figure the base excited plate\nresponse is presented as a semi log plot to allow study of regions\nof very large resonant response as well as regions of very low\nar.tiresonant response. Resonant and antiresonant responses are\nmost easily described analytically in terms of the poles and zeros\nof the transfer function, which can in general be written in the\nform\nH(s) - k(s-zI)(s-z2)--- :\n\ns-pl s-p 2 ---\t\n60\n\nWs)\t\ns\n\nr\n(5-4)\n\n,M\n\nd\n\naJ\n\nb\nra\n\nL\n\nr\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nO\n4b\n\nL\n\nII\n\nu\n\nn\n\nw\n\nc\n0\n\na\na^\n\nN\nr\n\nC\nb\n}\n\nU\n2\n_\n\nW\n\n^O\n\nW\nQ\nLL\n\nCL\nC\n\xe2\x96\xba-r\nGJ\nN\nro\n\nm\n\nC\n\nr\n\nO N\n\xe2\x80\xa24j rrO\n:3\nr-\n\n0 v+\n\nr\n\n^n 0\n41\n\n3 ^E\nO d\nN\nJ .\nto\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r\nLl^\n\n\t\nL\n\nA, 33N3H3H00\n\nindNI 3SV8\n\n\t\n901\n\n\t\nk\n\n{\n\n61\n\n0\n\n\t\n3SNOdS38\n\n31V1d 001\n\nwhere the transfer function zeros z l , z 2 --- are roots of the equation\nZ(s) = 0, and the transfer function poles p l , P2--- are roots of the\ncharacteristic equation P(s) - 0. For very lightly damped structures\nthese poles and zeros occur in conjugate complex pairs which are\nlocated very near to the imaginary axis. The plate response spectrum PSD Gp ( w) is related to the base input spectrum G b (w) by the\nequation\n\nGp(w) - Gb (w) (H(w)i 2\t(5-5)\nwhere H(jw) is the frequency response function obtained from the\ntransfer function H(s) simply by setting s -jw. A resonance occurs\nwhen\n\nIH(jw)l 2\n\nis maximum. This in turn occurs when the value s-jw\n\nis very close to (effectively is equal to the imaginary part of) a\ntransfer function pole p l , P 2 --- etc. Similarly an antiresonance\noccurs when\n\nIH(jw)l 2\n\nis a minimum. This in turn occurs when the\n\nvalue S = jw passes very close to (again, effectively equals the\nimaginary part of) a transfer function zero z l , z 2 --- etc. A\nresonance is a global characteristic of the structure and exists\nindependently of the spacewise nature of the input. An antiresonance,\non the pother hand, is a local characteristic of the structure; that\nis, it applies to a particular location only. Further, the location\nof the antiresonance, both spatially and in frequency, depends on\nthe spatial distribution of the input excitation.\nConsider now the two antiresonant responses which occur approximately at 825 Hz and at 1350 1Iz as shown in Figure 5-7. Since\nthe damping of the structure is very small, the antiresonant response is also very small (zero damping would result in truly a zero\n\n62\n\nresponse). Clearly such a small signal will be corrupted by ever\npresent backgrc...id noise. Hence a sharply reduced value of the\ncoherence ratio. Since this noise contamination occurs at the\noutput (response) of the transfer function\n\nH(w) we\n\nhave an example\n\nof output noise contamination as shown in Figure 5-3.\nSignificant reduction in the coherence ratio also occurs at\nthe resonant frequencies. However, the mechanism for this - an\ninput noise contamination caused by input loading effects - is\nobscured in this data because of inadequate resolution of the FFT.\nThe details of the input loading phenomenon will be taken up later\nduring the discussion of the high resolution experiments.\n5.3.3 Response Prediction Using Program RAND\nAt this point an attempt was made to compare the\n\nplate\n\n:,*:tense\n\nlevel obtained experimentally with the same response level predicted\nby Program RAND. The RAND model of the plate used damping ratios\ndetermined by free vibration decay measurements, natural frequencies\nobtained by FFT measurement, and mode shapes obtained by finite\nelement analysis. Four separate experiments were conducted using\nbase input excitation only. The base input and plate response\nspectra-were measured using the low resolution FFT analyzer. Because the FFT analyzer could not resolve the sharp response peaks\nadequately, there was little hope that experimentally measured\nresponse spectra would agree with the corresponding spectra preF\ndicted by RAND. However, FF T measurements of the rather slowly\nvarying broad band input spectra could be expected to be fairly\ngood. And the integrated area of the response peaks, that is, the\n\n63\n\noverall power of each resonance, would also be fairly accurate\nbecause the FFT algorithm accurately computes the correct power of\nthe time windowed signal, independent of resolution adequacy. The\nresults of these four runs are given in Table 5-3. The agreement\nbetween experiment and Program RAND is rather satisfactory, particularly when it is remembered that the excitation data input to\nRAND suffered from noise contamination and tie input spectrum was\npoorly resolved. Reasons for the relative success of the prediction procedure in the presence of these error producing effects\nwill be discussed later after the high resolution results have\nbeen presented.\n\nPun\nNo.\n\nTotal Overall Response\nExperimentil\nProgram RAND\n\nError\n\n1\n\n40.4 92\n\n44.8 g 2\n\n+.45 dB\n\n2\n\n41.1\n\n35.2\n\n-.67\n\n3\n\n54.3\n\n40-9\n\n-1.2\n\n4\n\n48.1\n\n37.3\n\n-1.1\n\nTable 5.3 Plate Response Estimates: Base Input, low Resolution Spect-a\n\n5.3.4 Input Identification Using Program RAND\nThe input identification mode of Program RAND takes as input\ndata the response spectrum of a structure, accounts for the transfer\ncharacteristics of the structure. and then computes the spectrum\nof the excitation applied to the structure. The use of a low\nresolution FFT analyzer for input identification mode measurements\nwill not be satisfactory since the analyzer must resolve th- details\nof a response spectrum\n\nwhich consists\n64\n\nof many sharp resonant peaks.\n\nNevertheless, it is instructive to look at an early example of an\ninput spectrum identification provided by the RAND procedure using\ndata obtained by the low resolution FFT analyzer, shown in Figure\n5-8. A comparison with the actual input spectrum (not shown)\nshows that the input spectrum estimate is of poor quality as\nanticipated, particularly near the resonant frequencies at 250 Hz,\n505 liz, 1105 Hz, 1310 Hz and 1445 Hz. But the most important aspect\nof this spectrum estimate is that it is dominated by three peaks\nwhich are very obviously in error, since the actual spectrum was\nrelatively flat with frequency. The presence of these peaks has\nnothing to do with the low resolution of the FFT analyzer. The\nfirst two peaKS, at 825 liz and at 1350 Hz, are caused by the poor\nsignal-to-noise ratio at the two antiresonances described above\nin Section 5.3.2. At an antiresonant frequency the transfer\ncharacteristic of the structure decreases nearly to zero. The\nstructural response, as measured by an accelerometer and estimated\nby an FFT analyzer, does not decrease nearly to zero ( as it should\ntheoretically, and as Program RAND expects) because of the presence\nof noise. The only explanation for this non-vanishing response,\nas far as Program RAND is concerned, is that the input must have\na very sharp peak. Thus erroneous peaks will always appear in\nthe input identification estimate at each antiresonant frequency\nof the structure. From a practical point of view the antiresonanceinduced error can be avoided by simply instructing Program RAND to\nset the input ident i fication estimate to zero for a small band of\nfrequency about each antiresonance, a process called blanking.\n\n65\n\nN\n\n()\ni--)\n\nb\n\n8\nLO\n\nO\n\n.-\t\n\n4-)\n\nO\t\n\nO\n\na\nC\nH\n\nLO\t\nP7\t\n\nai\nN\n(a\n\nm\nN\nZ\n\n4-O\n^\n\xe2\x80\xa2r\n\nU\t\n\nRs\n\n2 v\nr\n\nLL\'\t\nZ)\t\n\nLL\t\n\nl4\xe2\x80\xa2r\ny\nL^\nH\n\nC\nO\nr\nO\nu;\nQJ\n\n3\nG\nJ\nco\n\nL\n\nv\n\nS\'N8b NOilb8313DOV 3SVS (131311N301\n\n66\n\nThe implication of this phenomenon is that the transfer characteristic.of the structure which is stored in RAND must explicitly\ninclude antiresonant frequencies as well as resonant frequencies.\nIt is also clear that the input identification procedure will\nbreak down in the region of an antiresonance, and that a portion\nof the input spectra will be lost because of an inadequate signalto-noise ratio.\nThe third large source of error in Figure 5-8 extends over a\nband of frequency 1800<f<2000 Hz. This is caused by the fact that\nthe transfer characteristic stored in Program RAND includes only\nfive modes and is therefore only representative of the structure\nout to a frequency of, say, 1600 Hz. The error can be removed by\nsimply including an additional . (sixth) mode, thereby extending\nthe fidelity of the transfer characteristic to 2000 Hz.\nThe problems described in this section were discovered during\nearly low resolution input identification runs, and they called\nattention to the importance of assuring adequate bandwidth for\nthe structural transfer characteristic and to the value of antiresonant frequency blanking. These refinements were routinely\nincorporated in all subsequent low and high resolution studies.\n5.4 High Resolution Experiments\n5.4.1 Improved Estimates of Damping Ratio and Frequency\nThe addition of high resolution capability to the FFT analyzer\nquickly led to damping ratio and resonant frequency estimates which\nwere reproducible and also independent of any further reduction of\nthe resolution bandwidth setting of the analyzer. With this capa-\n\n67\n\nbility for precision it soon became apparent that the damping ratios\nand resonant frequencies were affected by subtleties in the boundary\nconditions of a particular test: for instance, whether or not the\nshaker fixture was blocked, what type of excitation was used, and\nwhether or not the loudspeaker was in position over the plate. The\nvariation in frequency with changes in boundary condition were\ntypically less than 1%. Unfortunately, due to input loading effects,\nsuch small variations in frequency are still significant as far as\nstructural response and input identification estimates were concerned. Discussion of the effect of boundary conditions will be\npostponed until after an examination of input loading models has\nbeen made.\nRepresentative results for high resolution frequency and\ndamping ratio are given in Table 5-4. The tabulated values are\nbased on the base input transfer function obtained by dividing the\nplate response (at center node) by the base input (at plate fixture).\nTheoretically (and experimentally) these results are the same as\nfor the boundary condition case in which the fixture motion is\nblocked.\n\nResonant\nFrequency\n\nDamping\nRatio\n\nQ\n\n1\n\n239.2 Hz\n\n.0046\n\n109\n\n2\n\n575.5 Hz\n\n.0022\n\n227\n\n3\n\n1050.3 Hz\n\n.0024\n\n208\n\n4\n\n1260.5 Hz\n\n.0015\n\n333\n\nMode\nNumber\n\nTable 5-4 High Resolution Mode Frequencies and Damping Ratios\n\n68\n\nThese damping ratios are significantly lower (and the corresponding\nQ va1ues.higher) than values obtained previously by low resolution\nFFT analysis or by the time domain transient decay technique.\nOnce more we emphasize that adequate frequency resolution is essential to the attainment of realistic damping estimates.\n5.4.2 Input Loading Effects: Base Excitation\n5.4.2.1 First ;lode Input and Response Characteristics\nHigh resolution dynamic characteristics of the first mode\nobtained from a random base excitation test are shown in Figure\n5-9. Several features are of interest. First, the base input\n(curve a) shows a sharp decrease and subsequent increase in level\nas the plate response peak (curve b) is passed. The input minimum\nis substantial enough to cause the coherence ratio (curve c) to\ndecrease, showing that the input minimum is contaminated by noise.\nCurve d shows the phase characteristic of the transfer function\nH(w): specifically, the phase of the plate response lags behind\nthe base input phase by 900 at a frequency of 238 Hz. Finally,\nthe magnitude of the transfer function (curve e) reaches a maximum\nat the same frequency. Note that this frequency differs from the\nfrequency at which the plate response magnitude is a maximum.\nThis pattern, or a similar pattern, rather generally occurred at\neach structural resonance under both base excitation or acoustic\nexcitation. The pattern consists of a decrease in the input level\nattended by a decrease in the coherence ratio, also an increase in\nthe input level, and a response maximum which occurs at a frequency\nwhich differs from the frequency of maximum transfer function\nmagnitude.\n69\n\nla)\nBASE\n\n+\t\n\nINPUT\n9RMS\n\n238 Hz\t\n\nFREQUENCY. f\n\nW\nPLATE\n\nRESPONSE\n9RMS\n\n239 Hz\t\n\nf\n\nW\nCQHERENCI\ny\n\n238 Hz\t\n\nf\n\n0a\n\nId) .900 ----------------^\n\nII\nI\n238 Hz\n\nt\n\n238 Hz\t\n\nMlw) -180\xc2\xb0\t\n\nf\n\nI\n\n(a)\nI H(w)l\n\n0\n\nFig. 5-9 High Resolution Spectra: Plate Response\nto Base Input ( First Mode)\n\n70\n\nThis input loading effect is not a new phenomenon. Much\nattention was given to input loading in the early-days of vibration\ntesting by the designers of electrodynamic shaker systems 4 . In\nfact, since the loading phenomenon was considered an undesirable\nfeature of vibration testing, electronic compensators called peaknotch filters were developed to render the vibration input spectrum flat with frequency. More extensive need for input spectrum\nadjustment led to the development of manual and finally automatic\ncompensation devices known as equalizers.\nOur interest here in the input loading phenomenon stems from\nthe expectation that input loading should be a relatively common\noccurrence in field studies of real structures. The value of analyzing the details of the input loading phenomenon in the relatively simple laboratory set up of this study is the insight that\nit provides for the more complicated field system.\n5.4.2.2 Model Development for Input loading Analysis\nAs stated earlier, the input loading is caused by the fact\nthat the base and the acoustic inputs possess finite source impedance. Consequently, the base input model must include a real\ndisplacement source of finite impedance rather than an ideal displacement source with infinite impedance. Similarly, the acoustic\ninput must be modelled as a real force source of finite impedance\nrather than an ideal force source of zero impedance. A simple\nmodel which adequately explains the input loading effects experimentally observed at the first plate resonance is shown in Fig.\n5-10. Parameters used in Fig. 5-10 are defined as follows:\n\n71\n\nf\n\nYa\t\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\'\n\n\xe2\x80\x94j\nka, ba\n\nACOUSTIC\nTRANSMISSION\nLINE\npoll!\nv\n\n\xe2\x80\x94j Yb\nPLATE\'\n\nkp, by\n\nSHAKER\'\nks, bs\n\n\'FIRST MODE REPRESENTATION ONLY\n\nFig. 5-10 Model for Input Loading Analysis\n\n72\n\nfa\tmagnetic force applied to speaker cone (zero\ninput impedance)\nma\tmass of rigid speaker cone and exciter coil\nka ,ba\tstiffness, damping coefficients for cone suspension\nZa\timpedance of acoustic trwrs^ission line\n\t\n\nm\n\nk ,b\t\np p\t\n\t\n\nf\nms\t\n\nplate mass associated with first plate mode\nstiffness, damping coefficients .associated with\nfirst plate mode\nmagnetic force applied to shaker armature (zero\ninput impedance)\nrigid body mass of shaker armature and plate\nfixture\n\nks ,bs\tstiffness, damping coefficients of shaker armature\nsuspension\nThe analysis of the input loading phenomenon is most easily\npresented as two special cases: base excitation of the plate, ignoring the acoustic elements, and the acoustic excitation of the\nplate with the shaker input set to zero (blocked). These cases are\nconsidered below in sections 5.4.2.3 and 5.4.3.2.\n5.4.2.3 Base Input Loading Analysis\nAn example of high resolution excitation and response spectra\nfor a base input run was given in Section 5.4.2.1, as well as a\nbroad description of the main features of the input loading effect.\nWe proceed now to study the base input case in more detail.\nConsider the case of base input only. The acoustic elements\nare assumed to be absent. The model of Fig. 5-10 simplifies to a\ntwo degree of freedom representation of the plate and shaker system.\nThe plate system, by itself, has a natural frequency w\n\n73\n\nand damping\n\nratio c p .\n\nThe shaker system, by itself, has a natural frequency\n\nWS and damping ratio c s .\n\nIf the resonant frequencies of the\n\nshaker anui of the plate are widely separated (w p\xc2\xbbws ), the fourth\ndegree characteristic function which determines the coupled\nresonant frequencies of the combined system can be factored into\ntwo quadratic terms as follows:\n\ncharacteristic function = (-W2\n\n+W12)(\n+j2c1Wk\n\n-W2+j2chwh+wh)2\t\n\n(5-6)\n\nthat is, the characteristic frequencies of the combined systems can\nbe described by a lower resonant frequency w t <w s , and a higher\nresonant frequency w h >w p .\n\nThe damping ratios of the separate \t\n\nf\n\nsystems, the shaker damping ratio c s and the plate damping ratio cp,\nare also affected when the shaker and plate are coupled. A first\napproximation to the relation between the separate and the coupled\nsystems are:\nm\nw\nW)\ns\n1\nw k 2 ^ ws ( \t- m 4cscp p\nS\nW\n\nc R\t\n\ncs\n\n1\t\nwh2 ti wp (\n\nc h\tcp\n\n1 -\n\n2\t\n\nb\n\ns\nW\np\n\nb\ns\n\nms -\n\n4c c p w )\ns\np\n\n+ s\n\n(5-7)\n\n(5-8)\n\n(5-9)\n\n2\n1 -\t\n\nws\np\n\n(5-10)\ns\n\nThe transfer functions for the base input and plate response accelerations can then be written as:\n\n74\n\n-w2 f\n\nS /m s (-w 2 + j2{ w w + w 2)\n\ny s -\t\n\n(5-11)\n\n(-w\n\ny\t\n\n=\t\nP\t\n\n-\n\n+J 2 4\n\nJNW +w R )(-w +j2Shwh\n\n/m\nw 2 fs s\t\n\n(-w\n\n( j 2Z w w+w\n\nw+w h\n\n)\n\n2)\n\n(5-12)\n\n+j2 ; R w R\n) ( \xe2\x80\x94w +j24 hwhw +w h )\nw+W k\n\nIf now we evaluate these transfer functions near the plate resonant\nfrequency wp ;z: wh\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xc2\xbbw tl the following block diagram is o b taine d:\n\nw 2 + j2^ p w 4 , + wp2\n\n\t\n\nyS\n\nj2tpwpw + w p 2\t\n\nVp\n\nfs/ms\n\xe2\x80\x94 w 2 + j24w h w + wh2\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 w 2 + j2^ p w p w + wp2\n\nFigure 5-11 Base Excitation Block Diagram\n\nSeveral aspects of this diagram are of particular importance. First,\nthe transfer function on the left co+isists of a conjugate pair of\nzeros and a conjugate pair of poles. On the complex plane, these\nroots are very close to each other and also very close to the imaginary axis, since w h and w\n\ndiffer only by very small quantities\n\nand the-damping ratios ^h and\n\nare \xc2\xabl. The corresponding freC\n\nquency response function has precisely the same antiresonant and\nresonant shape as base input curve (a) shown in Fig. 5-9. A second\nimportant aspect of the diagram is that the right hand transfer\nfunction precisely corresponds to the transfer function H(w) shown\nas curves ( d) and ( e) on Fig. 5-9. The final and perhaps most\nimportant aspect of the diagram is the fact that if these two\n\n75\n\ntransfer functions are cascaded to form a single transfer function\nbetween the shaker input force and the plate response acceleration,\nthere will be a pole-Zero cancellation associated with the plate\nfrequency w\n\nas shown in Fig. 5-12. This leads to the simple,\n\nand perhaps surprising result: since w\n\nst\n\nN,\n\nthe transfer func-\n\ntion shown in Fig. 5-12 is nearly that of a simple oscillator\nexcited by a constant input acceleration fs/ms.\n\nj2^ P w p w + wp2\nf s /m s --\xe2\x96\xba\t\n\nY\n\xe2\x80\x94w 2 +jn h w h w + wh2\t\n\nA\n\nFigure 5-12 Shaker Force to Plate Acceleration Transfer Function\n\nThis particular input acceleration level is the value that would\noccur if the plate were to cause no loading effect at all. In\nessence, then, the net effect of the input loading effect on the\nplate resonance is to shift it slightly upwards in frequency from\nto %. The magnitude of the plate resonance is virtually unchanged from the value it would have in response to an unloaded input\nfs /ms which is constant with frequency. So the effect of the input\nloading phenomenon on the plate response is rather minimal. However, the effect of the input loading phen omenon on the input to\nthe plate remains problematic. As we have seen, the input loading\neffect suppresses the input sufficiently to allow the signal to be\n\n76\n\nFR\nd\n4\n\ncontaminated by noise. It also Complicates the problem of input\nidentification because it is necessary to accurately resolve all\nthe details of an input which varies very rapidly with frequency,\nand to match the peak and notch frequencies of the input curve\nvery accurately with the plate response peak frequency.\n\n5.4.2.4 Response and Input Aentification Estimates for\nBase Excitation\nThe use of more accurate mode damping ratios and frequencies\nled to modest improvements in response estimates and substantial\nimprovement in input identification estimates. The results of\nplate response experiments with base excitation are shown in\nTables 5-5 and 5-6.\nTable 5-5 High Resolution Base Input Test: Response PSD at Resonance\n\nMode\nNo.\n\nes onse PSD at Resonance\nProgram RAND\nExperimental\n\nError\n\ng /Hz\n\n+1.5 dB\n\n1\n\n3.6\t\n\n2\n\n9.18\n\n7.14\n\n-1.1\n\n3\n\n4.69\n\n3.43\n\n-1.4\n\n4\n\n4.19\n\n3.02\n\n-1.4\n\ng /Hz\n\n5.13\t\n\nTable 5-6 High Resolution Base Input Test: Modal Response Power\n\nMode\nNo.\n\nesponse Power\nrogram RAND\nExperimental\n26.3\t\n\ng\n\n+ .96 dB\n\n1\n\n21.1\t\n\n2\n\n46.9\n\n38.7\n\n-\t .83\n\n3\n\n39.9\n\n29.1\n\n-1.4\n\n4\n\n39.3\n\n21.5\n\n-2.6\n\n155.4\n\n127.9\n\n-\t .85\n\nOverall\n\ng\n\nError\n\n77\n\nTable 5-5 shows the peak response PSO obtained by experiment and\nby RAPID. These results represent an improv ,%nent over the results\nattainable by low resolution experiments (low resolution, measurements of the sharply peaked power response spectra were typically\nin error by 12 to 16 dB). On the other hand, discrepancies between\nthe theoretical and experimental modal power estimates (Table 5-6)\nare approximately the same as for the low resolution estimates\n(Table 5-3). As mentioned before, this is because the FFT algorithm computes the correct power of a signal independent of the\ndegree of frequency resolution.\nSubstantial improvement in input identification accuracy is\nobtained by using high resolution FFT measurements. This improvement in accuracy is particularly evident at the plate resonant\nfrequencies where large errors had previously existed due to\ninadequate resolution of input loading effects. In Figure 5-13,\nthe RAPID estimation of the base input in the region near each of\nthe four plate resonances is compared with the measured input data.\nThe plot is semi logarithmic. By comparing both the measured and\nidentified base input power spectra to an arbitrary reference\nvalue, the ordinate can be scaled in dB as shown. The difference\nbetween the two curves can then be interpreted directly as an\nerror expressed in dB. The rather coarse sampling of these two\ndurves reflects the fact that the data link between the FFT analyzer\nand Program RAPID was not automated and input/output data taking was\ndone by hand. The accuracy of the input identification procedure,\nhowever, is satisfactory.

Broadly speaking, the acoustic loading effect is\nsimilar in pattern to the base input loading effect, although a\ncloser study will reveal differences in detail. The actual shape\nof the loaded acoustic input, for instance, is different from the\nshape of the loaded base input curve. This is because the dynamics\nof the acoustic excitation differs from the base input dynamics.\nDynamic models for the acoustic excitation of the plate are discussed in the next section and in the Appendix. An interesting\ncontrast also exists between Figures 5-14 and 5-15.

The explanation for this difference is that the method of fixture\nrestraint used in the blocked fixture test caused the damping\nlevel to be larger than that for the unblocked fixture test.\nThis emphasizes the fact that the input loading phenomenon becomes\nmore evident as the structural damping level decreases.\n5.4.3.2 Acoustic Input Loading Analysis\nAlthough the basic physical explanation for the acoustic input\nloading and the base input loading cases is similar, the acoustic\nand mechanical models required for the acoustic loading analysis\nis too complex to include in this section. These models are presented in some detail in Appendix A. Two acoustic excitation\ncases are of interest: excitation from a distant sound source\nwhich is not loaded by the plate generated sound waves, and excitation from a nearby sound source which is affected by the presence\nof the plate. The later case represents the experimental set up\nused in this study.\nThe results of the distant sound source analysis are presented\nin block diagram form, Fig. 5-16 (a). An incident pressure wive pi\nemanates from the distant sound source. It is partially reflected\nby the moving plate. The resulting total pressure at the plate\nsurface, po , is the sum of the incident and reflected wave pressures.\n\n83\n\nPi\t\n\n2 (\xe2\x80\x94w2 +j2^ PWP w + wP21\n\nA\t\n\nPo\n\nM\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 w 2 +j2t P I w P w + wP2)\n\nw2\nYP\n\n(\xe2\x80\x94 w 2\n\n+j2^\n\nWW\n\n+ wP2)\n\n(a)\n\nPi\t\n\nw2\t\n\n2A\t\nM\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 w2\n\nYP\n\n+j2^ P - w Pw +wP2\n(b)\n\nFigure 5-16 Acoustic Input Loading: Distant Source\n\nThe transfer function on the left again consists of a conjugate\npole-zero pair. Although the undamped.resonant frequency of the\npole and the zero pairs are the same, the pole pair is more\nheavily damped. Specifically, the pole damping ratio\n- b y + pcA\n(5-13)\n\np\n\n2 V kpmp\n\nincludes both the material damping coefficient b y of the plate and\nthe acoustic radiation damping effect pcA. The zero pair damping,\non the other hand, includes only the plate material damping coefficient b p .\n\nThe frequency response characteristic of the left\n\nhand transfer function is a gain of 2 (perfect reflection) at all\nfrequencies except at resonance, when it drops sharply down to\nt\',a value 2bp/(b p +pcA). Thus an input loading effect exists\n\n84\n\n\t\n\neven though the distant acoustic source is not affected by the\nreflected wave from the plate. Such a frequency response characteristic does not cause a shift in frequency of the plate acceleration response peak. The transfer function on the right is again\nsimply the transfer, function for the plate under acoustic excitation. When cascaded, as in Fig. 5-16 (b), the plate acceleration\nresponse exhibits a single resonance, with the same amplitude it\nwould have if excited by the incident pressure p i without loading\neffect.\nNext we consider the case of\'a nearby sound source (See\nAppendix for details). In Fig. 5-17 (a), a magnetic force f a acts\nupon the loudspeaker cone, causing a pressure po to act upon the\n\nf\t\na\n\n\xe2\x80\x94w2mP + ji.:b P + kP Po\t\n\nw2A\t\n\n_ W 2M P\n\nA\t\n\nY\n\n+ jwbP + k\n\n(a)\n\nfa\t\n\nw2A\n.1\t\n\ny\n\nP\n\nM\n\nFigure 5-17 Acoustic Input Loadinq: Near Source\nplate.

Note, however, that again the left hand transfer\nfunction which defines the pressure input to the plate consists of\na conjugate pole-zero pair, and that again a pole-zero cancellation\n\noccurs when the two transfer functions are cascaded as shown in\nFig. 5-17 (b). Our conclusion is again the same: although there\nis a complicated input loading interaction between the plate and\nthe acoustically coupled loudspeaker system, the plate response\nis nearly the same as it would be if there were no input loading\neffect at all. The actual resonant frequency of the acoustically\ncoupled plate differs slightly from the plate frequency which is\nexcited by a distant pressure source. And again, the estimation\nof details of the acoustic input p\n\nremain problematic for reasons\n\nalready stated above: the difficulties of estimating and measuring\nof high resolution narrow band spectra which vary rapidly with\nfregv. ncy.\n5.4.3.3 Response Estimates for Acoustic Excitation\nThe acoustic input and the acceleration response of the plate\nwere measured and compared with the plate response predictions\nof Program RAND. Table 5-7 shows the resonant peak PSD estimate\ncomparisons for the first four plate resonances.

In both the base input and\nthe acoustic input tests very close agreement between theory and\nexperiment is possible. Yet it is also possible for substantial\ndiscrepancy to occur (up to 6 dB in one acoustic input case),\neven in spite of the fact that measurements were made with a high\nresolution analyzer. These large errors result mostly from imperfect characterizations of the sharply varying loaded inputs.\nIn an attempt to avoid the difficulties of measuring the\nsharply varying acoustic input spectra, an alternative method of\ncharacterizing the input was introduced: the taking of a simple\naverage of the input PSC over a frequency bandwidth centered at\nthe plate resonance. This approach requires less effort than the\npoint-by-point characterization of the input, since the average\nis simply the ratio of the integrated power (obtained from the FFT\nanalyzer by either a high resolution or a low resolution measurement) divided by the bandwidth. The approach also yields better\nresults, as shown in Tables 5-9 and 5-10. A theoretical basis\nfor the relative success of the bandwidth average approach has\nalready been developed in the input loading studies in Sections\n5.4.2.3 and 5.4.3.2. In both these analyses it was found that\na sharply varying loaded input causes only a slight shift in the\nplate response resonance and does not significantly affect the\nresponse amplitude. It is reasonable that the loaded input can\njust as well be replaced by an equivalent input which is constant\n\n38\n\nTable 5-9 High Resolution Acoustic In Rut Test: Resonant Peak\nPSD stimatior, Using Bandwidth AveraLed\n\nMode\nNo.\n\nnpu\n\nResponse PSD at Resonance\nProgram RAND\n\nExperimental\n\nError\n\n1\n\n.00748 g 2 /Hz\n\n.00743 g 2/Hz\n\n-.03 dB\n\n2\n\n.0283\n\n.0285\n\n+.03\n\n3\n\n.0299\n\n.0302\n\n+.04\n\n4\n\n.0240\n\n.0474\n\n+2.95\n\nTable 5-10 High Resolution Acoustic In ut Test: Modal Power\nEstimation Using Bandwidth veraged Input\n\nMode\nNo.\n\nResponse Power\nProgram RAND\n\nExperimental\n\nError\n\n1\n\n.025 92\n\n.0257 g 2\n\n+.12\n\n2\n\n.084\n\n.113\n\n+1.29\n\n3\n\n.234\n\n.236\n\n+.04\n\n4\n\n.123\n\n.279\n\n+3.5\n\n89\n\nwith frequency. The easiest equivalent is a simple bandwidth\naveraged. input. Further discussion of this simplified approach\nis presented below in Section 5.6.\n5.5 Combined Base and Acoustic Excitation Experiments\nThe base excitation and the acoustic excitation were simultaneously applied to the plate at amplitudes which would each\nseparately cau r\nze comparable response levels. Low resolution\n\nmeasurements were made of the pressure input PSD, the base acceleration PSD, the coincident and quadratu:e ( gnponents of the cross\nPSD for the pressure and base inputs, and the integrated response\npower of the plate. These spectra are shown in Figures 5-18 through\n5-20. No corresponding response estimates have been made using\nProgram P.M.\nTwo aspects of these spectra are of interest. First, each\nof these inputs, applied separately, would cause comparable responses of the second, third and fourth modes. When these inputs\nare combined, however, the plate response shows a relatively enhanced second mode and a relatively attenuated third mode. This\neffect is caused by the phase relationship between the two inputs.\nAnalysis of the response of a simple harmonic oscillator to\nstatistically coupled inputs (Section 4.3.1) showed that the two\ninputs can either work together or work against each other, depending mostly on the sign and magnitude of the coincident component of the input cross power spectral density. A large negative\ncoincident component will cause reinforcement of the inputs, whereas\na large positive coincident component will tend to cause input\ncancellation. On this basis, the first mode should be suppressed,\nthe second mode enhanced, the third mode unaffected, and the\n90\n\ni\n\nN\nT\n\nN\nT\ni\n\nb\n41\nG\n\nv\n\nE\nO\nU\n\ni\nO\nU\n^o\nsy:.\nU\ncd\nLz\n\ny^\n.3\n\nC1\n\nU 4J\nV1 LL\n\nU ^:J b\n\n(V 11\n\nV\n\nr\n\nU :`\nLL L.L.!\nt\nL.!\xe2\x80\xa2f\n\nN\n\nC"\n\xe2\x80\xa2r\n\n(V\n\n8\nz\n\nL\n\n0\n\nO\n\nUJd 11ldNl :lJdU3\nN\nC%\n\nQi\n\n\'^7\nY\n\n91\n\nQSd indNI NOUV831300V 3SV8\n\nN\n\nN\n\nO\n\nN\n7\nd\nC\n4\n\nu\n++\n\nN\n7\nO\n\nu\n\nc\n^o\nd\n\nu\ni\nO\nLL-\n\nU\n\n0\n\ni\n\n0\n\nv-\n\n^c\n\ni\nu\n\na\n\nn.\nu^\nV1\n\nO\n\ni\nU\n01\nu^\n\nv,\n.r\nLa.\n\nN\n\n1\n\n1\n\na\n\nlz\nd\nO\t\n\nO\nasd SSOUD 3an1VUCVnO\n\n4Sd SSObJ IN3QIONIOJ \t\n\ng ^,\n\nN\n\nN\n7\n0.\nC\nV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r\nH\n\nV\nQ\nC\n\nH\n\n4I\n\nvi\nro\n\nG1\nC\n.r.\n\ncn\n\nE\n0\n\nv\n\n0\nY\nU\nZ\nr.\nD\n\n0\n\n0\nw\n\nv\n\nLL\n\nN\nd\'\n\nG.\n\nG1\n\nN\nw\n\nro\n\n(D\n>ti\nI\n\nLL^\n\nO\n\nAe \'J Qsd 35NOdS3d 31VId\n\n93\n\nfourth mode strongly enhanced, each relative to the superposition\nof the response to the acoustic and base inputs applied separately.\nRoughly speaking, these effects appear consistent with the experimentally measured responses shown in Figure 5-20.\nA second feature of the combined excitation spectra is the\nt\t\n\nobvious presence of input loading effects at the resonant frequencies of the plate. This is particularly noticeable on the\ncoincident and quadrature components of the input cross power\n(Figure 5-19) even though the low resolution FFT analysis would\ngenerally tend to obscure such effects.\nIt has already been established that it is difficult to\nobtain good response estimates when they are based on measured\ninput spectra which experience input loading effects. The case\nwill be no different as.far as the input loaded cross power\nspectra are concerned. Although a bandwidth averaging technique\noffers some improvement for the case of individual input spectra,\nit remains to be demonstrated whether or not a similar procedure\nwill be successful when cross input spectra are concerned.\n5.6 Simplified Treatment of Input Loading Effects\nWe have already seen the effectiveness of using a simple\nbandwidth averaging technique when dealing with input loaded\nspectra. This technique simplifies the measurement procedure\nana leads to a better structural response estimate. Some questions remain, however. Analysis of the input loading phenomenon\n\nr\n\nsuggests that a constant, equivalent input spectrum can replace\nthe sharply varying input loaded spectrum. The analysis does\n\n94\t\n\n-^\n\nnot suggest, however, that the bandwidth average is the correct\nestimate . of the constant, equivalent input. As damping decreases,\nfor instance, the bandwidth average increases, whereas the theoretical value of the constant, equivalent input remains unchanged.\nThere is also the practical question of determining a suitable\nbandwidth for the average. A larger bandwidth lessens whatever\nerror may apply because the technique itself is not theoretically\ncorrect. On the other hand, a large bandwidth will tend to obscure\ninput spectrum variations which have nothing to do with the input\nloading phenomenon. The answers to these questions will require\nfurther study. In the mean time, the bandwidth averaging technique\noffers a distinct improvement over precise point-by-point measurement of the input loaded spectrum.\n\nWhat procedure should be followed when input identification\nestimates are to be made? Not only is such an identification of\nan input loaded spectrum difficult, but it would seem that it is\nalso undesirable. It is of much more practical interest to identify the constant, equivalent input spectrum which will yield the\nsame measured resonant response. In this case a theoretical guideline is^available. For an isolated resonant mode excited by a\nwhite noise the acceleration response power is given by\n\nmode response power = n r 2\tGo fn Q\t\n\n(5-15)\n\n-7-\n\nwhere r is the modal participation factor. In the input identification situation, the white noise input Go , equivalent to the input\nloaded spectrum near the resonant mode, is to be estimated.\n\n95\n\n........_\n\nt\n\nRearrange eqn (5-15):\nMode response power\n\nGo\n\n2r2\n\n(5-16)\nfnQ\n\nOn the right hand side of eqn (5-16), the node response power is\nmeasured, fn and Q are known, and r is computed by Program RAND.\nSo a theoretically correct constant equivalent input spectrum can\nbe identified in simple fashion near the resonant mode. At nonresonant regions the problem of input loaded spectra does not\nexist and input identification can proceed in standard fashion\nusing the input identification mode of Program RAND.\n5.7 Conclusion to Part II\nImplementation of the RAND procedure in an experimental\nsituation brings in a wnole new set of problems: measurement\naccuracy, resolution, input loading effects, noise contamination\nof signals, and statistical averaging. Data show that given\nsufficient care and effort it is possible to obtain useful and\nmeaningful response and input identification estimates.\nThe phenomenon of input loading proved to be significant\nexperimentally and of definite interest theoretically. The\nsimple analytical treatment of this phenomenon reflects the\nsimple structures which comprised the laboratory set up. Work\nremains to be done to study the extent to which the present input\nloading models apply to complex field situations, for it is easy\nto speculate that input loading can have considerable practical\nt\t\n\t\n\nsignificance. Imagine that a structural component undergoes\nvibration testing and then it is placed in a spacecraft for\n\ni\ndevelopmental flight testing or undergoes further vibration\ntesting at a high structural integration level. In either case,\n\n96\n\ninstrumentation is provided to characterize the base input level\nto the component. The results of this study have shown that a\nsharp peak can occur in the input spectrum due to an input loading\neffect, and that this peak, being slightly but critically detuned\nto the measured resonant frequency of the component, will have\nonly a second order effect on the component resonant response.\nNow consider that the sharp input peak is discovered by an environmental specification writer, who routinely draws an envelope\nover\n\nit.\n\nAn erroneous coincidence between the input peak and the\n\ncomponent resonance is thereby guaranteed, and the resulting specification is substantially overestimated.\nFinally, two considerations are added to give prospective to\nthe experimental study described in Part II. First, we note that\nall of the experimental work was done without the benefit of a\nmodern modal analysis system and without automatic data acquisition\nequipment. The former tool would have greatly improved the accuracy\nof the dynamical modelling of the structure. The latter tool,\nutilized to interface the FFT analyzer output directly to the\ncomputer, would have greatly increased the speed and ease of I/O\noperations with Program RAND, thereby making possible the use of\nthe full resolution capabilities of the FFT analyzer. The second\nconsideration is simply the recognition that it is important to\ndistinguish between experimental work done in the laboratory, and\nexperimental work done on much more complicated structures under\nfield conditions. Obviously success in the laboratory does not\nguarantee success in the field.\n\n97\n\nJ\n\n_\n\nHopefully the techniques developed and knowledge gained in\nthis study, coupled with improved hardware tools, will add to\nthe success with which structural response and input identification estimates are made under real field conditions.\n\n98\n\nt\n6.0 Summary\nThis study has focused on the problem of the response and\ninput identification of a structure subjected to combined base\n\t\n\nand acoustic excitation. The study has included both theoretical\n\nr\n\t\nf\n\nand experimental approaches. Specific accomplishments are:\n1.\n\nThe development of a computer program RAND to make\nresponse and input identification estimates for a\nstructure subjected to combined base and acoustic\nexcitations.\n\n2.\n\nThe development of parametric design guidelines\nfor plates subjected to random base or acoustic\nexcitation.\n\n3.\n\nThrough a combination of analysis and experimentation, the evaluation of the applicability of the\nRAND procedure to a laboratory test situation,\nand the identification of the crucial considerations\nwhich affect the quality of structural input and\nresponse estimates.\n\n99\n\nAppendix A\n\nA.l Acoustic Input Loading Analysis\nA.1.1 Case 1: Distant Sound Source\nRefer to Figure 5-10: Model for Input Loading Analysis.
