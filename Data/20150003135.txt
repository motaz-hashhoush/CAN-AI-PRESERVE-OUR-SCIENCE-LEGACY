The\nAdvisor performs pair-wise comparisons of current position\nand projected path of each vehicle with other surface vehicles\nto detect conflicts, determine critical sections, and provide\nhold advisories to traffic controllers recommending vehicles\nstop at entry points to protected zones around identified critical sections. A critical section defines a segment of the vertexedge graph where vehicles are in crossing or merging or\nopposite direction gridlock contention. The Advisor detects\ncritical sections without reference to scheduled, projected or\nrequired times along assigned vehicle paths, and generates\nhold advisories to prevent conflicts without requiring network\npath direction-of-movement rules and without requiring\nrerouting, rescheduling or other network optimization solutions.\n\nNov. 17, 2011\n\nRelated U.S. Application Data\n(60) Provisional application No. 61/334,288, filed on May\n13, 2010.\n\n(51)\n\nInt.

A new set of hold advisories\nis generated at each automatic update cycle. In one embodiment, the new set of hold advisories is automatically updated\nat least once per second. In another embodiment, the new set\nof hold advisories is automatically updated at least once every 5\nthirty seconds. In yet another embodiment, the new set of hold\nadvisories is automatically updated at a rate of at least thirty\nhertz.\nThe Advisor provides recommended instructions (hold\nadvisories) for stopping aircraft and other vehicles traversing io\nan airport surface. The Advisor methodology processes input\ndata describing vehicle positions and assigned/planned route\npaths through the airport surface traffic network, and generates hold advisories. The airport surface traffic network\nresources (i.e., taxiway and ramp segments) are single-lanes 15\nwhere vehicles can move in either direction but cannot\nreverse direction and cannot pass each other. The Advisor\nperforms pair-wise comparisons of the projected path of each\nvehicle with that of other surface vehicles. Where the Advisor\ndetermines a conflict for use of a segment of the airport 20\nsurface traffic network exists, the Advisor identifies the segment of the airport surface traffic network as a critical section.\nA critical section defines a portion of the surface network\nwhere two vehicles are in contention with respect to crossing\nor merging conflicts or approach a segment from opposite 25\ndirections, creating gridlock. The Advisor then defines a protected zone around each identified critical section. The protected zone includes entry points where a vehicle can be held\nbefore reaching the identified conflict. The Advisor determines which vehicle or vehicles to hold at an entry point to the 30\nprotected zone for the critical section (i.e., stop at the entry\npoint to the protected zone for the critical section) and which\nvehicle to allow to proceed through the critical zone. The\nAdvisor than issues advisories to the traffic controllers defining the vehicles to hold and where to hold them to prevent the 35\nconflict. These advisories prevent network gridlock and\nresolve crossing and merging conflicts at intersections. The\nAdvisor does not monitor and prevent potential conflicts as\nvehicles move through identified critical sections.\nThe advisory enables a traffic controller to issue a hold 40\ninstruction prior to a vehicle reaching the hold point on the\nentry boundary to the protected area for the critical section.\nThe Advisor continually reassesses the state of the airport\ntraffic network and issues or discontinues hold advisories. A\ndiscontinuance of a hold advisory allows a vehicle to continue 45\nwithout stopping or restart forward movement after stopping\nat a hold point.\nThe present invention has several embodiments in which\nthe methodology is a modular component of a basic automated surface traffic control system, an advanced automated 50\nsurface traffic control system and fast-time or real-time computer simulations of automated surface traffic control systems. FIG. 1 illustrates the integration of the Advisor as a\nhardware/software component of a generic automated surface traffic control system. Such automated systems include 55\nthe Tower Fight Data Manager (TFDM), Advanced Surface\nMovement Guidance and Control Systems (A-SMGCS) and\nAerobahn. TFDM and A-SMGCS support air traffic controller operations and Aerobahn supports airline ramp traffic\ncontroller operations. The surface automated traffic control 60\nsystems are supported by or include auxiliary systems or\nsub-systems that provide surveillance, fight plan, meteorological, traffic flow constraints and associated data. For\nexample, Airport Surface Detection Equipment Version X\n(ASDE-X) provides surface vehicle surveillance data.\n65\nIn some embodiments, the present invention is a hardware/\nsoftware decision support tool (DST) operating as a sub-\n\n10\nsystem within the automated surface traffic control system. In\nthis embodiment, the Advisor includes software running on a\ncomputer 10 having at least a 32-bit architecture with a minimum speed of 1.8 GHz. having access to at least 2 GB of\nmemory. In some of these embodiments, the computer 10\nreceives data from airport surface surveillance systems 20,\nsuch as ASDE-X, automated airport surface traffic control\nsystems 30, which may include other decision support tools\n(DSTs), and other airport operations systems, such as flight\noperations data 35, weather data 36, and local operations\nadaptation data repository 37, as shown in FIG. 1.\nThe Advisor processes vehicle state inputs provided by\nairport surveillance systems, route assignment inputs provided by automated airport surface traffic control systems or\nother DSTs, airport infrastructure inputs maintained by the\nautomated system defining the airport surface traffic network\nand parameters for analyzing potential traffic conflicts, and\ngenerates hold advisories to surface air traffic controllers\nand/or ramp controllers 12, as shown in FIG. 1. The automated airport surface traffic control systems include interfacing sub-systems that provide the hold advisories to traffic\ncontrollers. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, input data\ndescribes the current position of vehicles and assigned/\nplanned paths and airport specific infrastructure components\n(network structure, operating parameters). The Advisor processes the input data and generates hold advisories for\nvehicles operating on the airport surface that are provided to\ntraffic controllers.\nFIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of theAdvisor that is part\nof a basic automated surface traffic control system comprising surveillance and communication equipment and software/hardware components. In this embodiment, the computer 10 running the Advisor software receives data from\nairport surface surveillance systems 20, basic airport surface\ntraffic control systems 31, such as Tower Flight Data Manager\n(TDFM) andAerobahn, and other airport operations systems,\nsuch as local operations adaptation data repository 37, as\nshown in FIG. 2. The basic automated surface traffic control\nsystem 31 also includes other DSTs that monitor vehicle\nstates, define optimized route paths and schedules but continues to use autonomous pilot/operator control of vehicles to\nprovide self-separation in-trail between vehicles to prevent\nvehicles overtaking one another on the single-lane taxiway\nand ramp segments of the airport surface traffic network.\nSurface vehicles conduct self-separation subject to the\nrequirement that that the surface vehicles shall stop within\nand block an intersection. As part of the self-separation operating concept, the basic automated surface traffic control\nsystem requires the vehicle pilot/operator to not stop within a\ntaxiway intersection so as to not block transit of that intersection for use by crossing vehicles. The Advisor generates hold\nadvisories to prevent gridlock and crossing and merging conflicts subject to the understanding that vehicles will not enter\nan intersection when following a preceding vehicle unless\nsufficient spacing is guaranteed to be available to completely\nexit the intersection.\nFIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment of theAdvisor that is part\nof an advanced automated surface traffic control system. In\nthis embodiment, the computer 10 running the Advisor software receives data from airport surface surveillance systems\n20, advanced airport surface traffic control systems 32, and\nother airport operations systems, such as local operations\nadaptation data repository 37, as shown in FIG. 3.

In these situations,\nthe Advisor will continually reassess the situation and determine the sequence of the vehicles for proceeding through the\ncritical section in order. In some of these cases, the Advisor 5\ndetermines the sequence of vehicles to proceed through the\ncritical section based on user-defined prioritization criteria\n(which are part of the operating rules input data shown in\nFIGS. 2-4). For example, a first-come first served prioritization would allow the vehicle closest to the critical section to io\nproceed through the critical section without holding. Alternatively, the vehicle with the earlier network entry time or\nrequested exit time would be allowed to proceed through the\ncritical section without holding while hold advisories are\nissued for the other competing vehicles.\n15\nFIG. 17 illustrates a case in which a protected zone for an\nunoccupied gridlock critical section is identified for two\nvehicles that is currently located at a considerable distance\nfrom the protected zone. In this situation, the present invention will not internally generate a hold due to blockage for thi s 20\nsituation.\nIn some embodiment, the Advisor determines the distance\nof each vehicle from the protected zone of the identified\ncritical section and using a closest-distance priority, issues a\nhold advisory for the vehicle the furthest distance from the 25\nprotected zone to stop upon reaching an entry point to the\nprotected zone, as illustrated in FIG. 18. In FIG. 18, the\nAdvisor issues a hold advisory for Vehicle B based on the\nclosest-distance priority, to stop because Vehicle A is closest\nto the protected zone of the gridlock critical section. FIG. 18 30\nshows the current positions of Vehicles A and B and the\nprojected hold position of Vehicle B resulting from the issuance of a hold advisory. The intent of the hold advisory is for\nthe held vehicle to proceed along its assigned path unhindered\nto the entry point to the critical section, subject to the condi- 35\ntion that it stops at the entry point unless otherwise notified.\nThe other vehicle is not issued a hold advisory. In another\nembodiment, the order priority is based on the earliest\nrequested, estimated or required entry time into a critical\nsection. Other prioritization schemes are based on externally- 40\nderived scheduled entry and/or exit times (e.g., for aircraft,\ngate and/or runway times), impact on delay or throughput,\nowner\'s vehicle ranking (e.g., airline bid value of a flight), or\nrandom assignment. The above prioritization schemes or\nother prioritization alternatives may be used individually or in 45\nsuccession to prioritization assignments.\nAt each invocation, the Advisor identifies holds at critical\nsections without reissuing hold advisories previously issued\nto vehicles if their potential conflict condition is no longer\nprojected. The Advisor will issue a set of hold advisories that 50\ndoes not include the previous hold advisory to thereby discontinue the previous hold advisory when the potential conflict condition is no longer valid. The discontinuance of a hold\nadvisory essentially revokes the advisory. Given a sufficiently\nlong look-ahead span over the forward path, the hold discon- 55\ntinuance will often occur well before the vehicle has reached\na downstream critical section. In this case, the vehicle would\nnot stop, and can enter and traverse the critical section without\ndelay.\nFIG. 19 illustrates the case in which a previously deter- 60\nmined gridlock critical section is no longer valid because the\ncurrent position of Vehicle shows that Vehicle has exited\nfrom the gridlock critical section. Therefore, the previously\nissued hold advisory for Vehicle B is discontinued (i.e., not\nreissued) at this instant, essentially revoking this advisory. 65\nVehicle B continues on its path without any stoppage due to\nthe now discontinued hold advisory. The previously held\n\n18\nvehicle, Vehicle B, is no longer subject to a hold advisory and\ncontinues transiting toward and through the critical section\nwithout experiencing stoppage along its path.\nUpon determining all potential conflicts and protected\nzones, the Advisor issues hold advisories to traffic controllers\nfor the vehicles to be held. Generally, only the first/earliest\nhold along any one vehicle\'s path need be issued at the current\ninstant. Couluris, Davis et al. describes critical sections as\nobjects of hold solutions in a fast time simulation, but does not\nincorporate protection zones to resolve blockages, resolution\nof holds due to externally generated holds, prioritized resolution of holds and resolution of induced blockages.\nFunctional Description of the Advisor\nThe Advisor process is continually and automatically\ninvoked, and comprises the following functional components:\nDetection of Critical Sections;\nInternal Generation of Holds due to Blockage;\nResolution of Externally Generated Holds;\nPrioritized Resolution of Unassigned Holds; and\nResolution of Induced Potential Blockages.\nWhile blockage prevention is a prime function of the Advisor, it is only one component of the overall Advisor process in\nthis embodiment. The disclosed embodiment of the Advisor\nis applicable to aircraft and other vehicles (service trucks,\nemergency vehicles, etc) on an airport surface, that are moving or taxiing in the airport surface traffic network (graph)\ncomposed of edges (taxiway and ramp segments) and vertexes (intersections and terminal gates) under traffic control.\nEach of the above functional components is discus sed in more\ndetail in the following paragraphs.\nDetection of Critical Sections To start each assessment,\nthe Advisor examines all vertexes along each searchpath. The\nsearch path starts at and includes the most recent vertex the\nvehicle has crossed and proceeds along the sequence of\nremaining vertexes on the planned/assigned forward path.\nThis examination is conducted for all vehicles active on the\nsurface as well as pending entries (e.g., departure aircraft\nwaiting at gates) to determine critical sections on the airport\nsurface traffic network (e.g., airport surface). These detections use position and path data without reference to scheduled, projected or required times along assigned vehicle\npaths.\nInternal Generation of Holds due to Blockage Once all of\nthe critical sections on the airport surface traffic network are\ndetected, the Advisor examines each vehicle pair competing\nfor the use of each critical section and determines which of\nthese vehicles (one, both or none) to hold outside the critical\nsection. These determinations use position and path data\nwithout reference to scheduled, projected or required times\nalong assigned vehicle paths. The Advisor conducts Resolution of Induced Potential Blockages, described below, to\nresolve induced potential blockages.\nResolution of Externally Generated Holds The Advisor\nprocesses hold advisories generated by external functions,\nand resolves any externally induced blockage by issuing hold\nadvisories that reset the hold position inducing the blockage.\nHowever, in some situations the reset hold position itself may\ninduce a new blockage, which the Advisor resolves by conducting Resolution of Induced Potential Blockages,\ndescribed below.\nPrioritized Resolution of Unassigned Holds A critical\nsection is considered to be resolved when either no vehicle or\none vehicle is not subject to being held in accordance with an\nissued hold advisory. For each critical section still unresolved\nat this point in the Advisor solution process (i.e., a critical\nsection for which more than one competing vehicle has not\n\nUS 8,566,016 B2\n19\nbeen subject to a hold in a hold advisory), theAdvisor selects\none of these vehicles for entry into the identified critical\nsection and issues a hold advisory to hold the other vehicles\nthat conflict for the identified critical section. The selection is\nbased on user-defined prioritization criteria specific to the\nenvironment under assessment. In one embodiment, the order\npriority is based on closest path distance to the critical section\nentry vertex. In another embodiment, the order priority is\nbased on estimated vertex crossing times where the crossing\ntimes can be provided by functions external to theAdvisor. In\nother embodiments, the Advisor uses one or more of the\nprioritization alternatives in succession to determine vehicle\nprioritization assignments. The Advisor conducts Resolution\nof Induced Potential Blockages, described below, to resolve\nany induced potential blockages due to prioritized hold advisories.\nResolution of Induced Potential Blockages The generation of a hold advisory from one or more of Internal Generation of Holds due to Blockage, Resolution of Externally Generated Holds or Prioritized Resolution of Unassigned Holds\ncan result in a projected intrusion into a protected zone. An\nintrusion occurs if the vehicle\'s projected hold position\ninfringes the protected zone of a critical section. For each\nintruded protected zone, the Advisor applies Resolution of\nInduced Potential Blockages as appropriate to evaluate the\nintrusion and determine a new hold advisory assignment that\neliminates the intrusion. The new hold advisory repositions\nthe vehicle whose hold position intrudes into a protected zone\nto the entry point to the protected zone of the critical section\nin which the vehicle potentially intruded. If this revised hold\nposition induces a new potential blockage at the next\nupstream vertex back along the intruder\'s path, the advisor\niterates the Resolution of Induced Potential Blockages solution. The iteration could examine a series of new hold positions along the intruder\'s path subject to the limit of the\nintruder\'s current position (i.e., the final hold position cannot\nbe upstream/behind the intruder\'s current position).\nFIG. 30 shows the process for resolving externally induced\nblockage of a critical section in one embodiment of the\npresent invention. In this embodiment, the Advisor determines whether the externally-assigned hold position places\nany portion of the vehicle within the protected zone of an\nidentified critical section. Where the externally-assigned hold\nposition places any portion of the vehicle is within the protected zone of another identified critical section, the Advisor\nissues a new hold advisory that moves the externally-assigned\nhold position to an entry point to the other identified critical\nsection to prevent the vehicle blocking the other identified\ncritical section. The Advisor reviews the repositioned hold\nposition to determine whether the repositioned hold point\nblocks another identified critical section until the repositioned hold point does not induce blockage of any identified\ncritical section.\nAlternative Embodiments\nThe Advisor includes a modular software component that\nruns on either dedicated or shared computer system\nresources. In various embodiments, the Advisor is a modular\ncomponent of the following systems:\na basic automated surface traffic control system;\nan advanced automated surface traffic control system;\na real-time computer simulation system; and\na fast-time computer simulation system.\nEach of the above embodiments is discussed in the following sections. In another derived embodiment, which is based\n\n20\non modifications of any one of the above four embodiments,\ntheAdvisor is used as a decision support tool to generate hold\nadvisories.\nBasic Automated Surface Traffic Control System Embodi5 ment\nIn this embodiment, the Advisor is a hardware/software\ndecision support tool within a basic automated surface traffic\ncontrol system, as shown in FIG. 1. The Advisor generates\nhold advisories by applying the solution process shown in\n10\nFIG. 20 at each invocation. In this embodiment, the methodology of the Advisor comprises the following steps:\nDetection of Critical Sections\nFor each pair of vehicles on the airport surface, theAdvisor\ndetermines if their projected paths share any vertexes on the\n15\ngraph. The search paths start at each vehicle\'s most recently\ncrossed vertex and proceed along the planned/assigned forward path. The process for detecting crossing, merging and\ngridlock critical sections includes the following steps.\n20\nCrossing Critical Section Detection The Advisor selects\neach vertex along the path of one of the selected vehicles and\ndetermines whether the other vehicle shares this vertex, as\nshown in FIG. 21. If the two aircraft share any surface graph\nvertex along their paths and the aircraft enter the shared vertex\n25 from directions that are different but not opposite to one\nanother, then each shared vertex is a unique crossing critical\nsection for this aircraft pair. However, the Advisor will eliminate the vertex as a potential crossing critical section if the\nvertex is the most recently crossed vertex of one of the\n30 vehicles and neither of the two vehicles occupies any part of\nthe vertex polygon at the current instant. This process is\nrepeated for each vertex along the projected path of the\nselected vehicle. This process is repeated for each vehicle in\nthe airport surface traffic network using pair-wise compari35\nsons.\nMerging Critical Section Detection When the Advisor\ndetermines that the projected paths for two vehicles share a\ncontiguous set of multiple vertexes on the graph, the direction\n40 of travel of the vehicles through the contiguous set of multiple\nvertexes is the same, and the aircraft enter the first shared\nvertex from different directions, then the sequence of shared\ncontiguous vertexes and enclosed edges is a merging critical\nsection for this aircraft pair, as shown in FIG. 22. However,\n45 theAdvisor will eliminate the sequence of shared contiguous\nvertexes and enclosed edges as a potential merging critical\nsection if the entry vertex is the most recently crossed vertex\nby one of the vehicles and neither of the two vehicles occupies\nany part of the entry vertex at the current instant, as shown in\n5o FIG. 22. If the sequence of shared contiguous vertexes and\nenclosed edges are determined to be a merging critical section\nfor this aircraft pair, the Advisor then removes each of the\nshred contiguous vertexes from further consideration for this\nvehicle pair.\n55\nGridlock Critical Section Detection When the Advisor\ndetermines that the projected paths for two vehicles share a\ncontiguous set of multiple vertexes on the graph, the direction\nof travel of the vehicles through the contiguous set of multiple\nvertexes is opposite, then each sequence of shared contiguous\n60 vertexes and enclosed edges is a gridlock critical section for\nthis aircraft pair, as shown in FIG. 23. However, the Advisor\nwill eliminate the sequence of shared contiguous vertexes and\nenclosed edges as a potential gridlock critical section if one of\nthe vehicles aircraft does not occupy any part of the exit vertex\n65 at the current instant and the exit vertex for this vehicle is the\nmost recently crossed vertex by that vehicle (i.e., vehicle has\nexited from protected zone of critical section).\n\nUS 8,566,016 B2\n21\nIf none of the above critical section detections apply, the\nAdvisor determines that there are no critical sections between\nthese two vehicles.\nInternal Generation of Holds Due to Blockage\nThe process for detecting internal generation of holds due 5\nto blockage includes the following steps.\nCrossing Critical Section Hold Generation due to Blockage For each identified crossing critical section for a pair of\nvehicles where the Advisor has not previously issued a hold\nadvisory assigning a hold position for one of the vehicles as io\npart of a previous pair-wise comparison, The Advisor will\nissue a hold advisory for the vehicle that is not occupying any\npart of the protected zone for the identified crossing critical\nsection when any part of the other vehicle occupies any part of\nthe protected zone for the identified crossing critical section 15\n(vertex polygon) at the current instant, as shown in FIG. 24.\nThe hold advisory will hold the vehicle at the applicable entry\npoint to the protected zone for this crossing critical section.\nThe Advisor will also designate the aircraft being held in the\nissued hold advisory to be held in any other aircraft pair that 20\nhas a conflict for this crossing critical section. Note the held\naircraft may be in numerous pairs that are conflicting for one\nor multiple critical sections. This step eliminates subsequent\nredundant assessments and prevents potentially contradictory\nhold assignments.\n25\nMerging Critical Section Hold Generation due to Blockage For each identified merging critical section for a pair of\nvehicles where the Advisor has not previously issued a hold\nadvisory assigning a hold position for one of the vehicles as\npart of a previous pair-wise comparison, The Advisor will 30\nissue a hold advisory for the vehicle that is not occupying any\npart of the protected zone for the identified crossing critical\nsection when any part of the other vehicle occupies any part of\nthe protected zone for the identified crossing critical section\n(vertex polygon) at the current instant, as shown in FIG. 25. 35\nThe hold advisory will hold the vehicle at the applicable entry\npoint to the protected zone for this merging critical section.\nThe Advisor will also designate the aircraft being held in the\nissued hold advisory to be held in any other aircraft pair that\nhas a conflict for this merging critical section. Note the held 40\naircraft may be in numerous pairs that are conflicting for one\nor multiple critical sections. This step eliminates subsequent\nredundant assessments and prevents potentially contradictory\nhold assignments.\nGridlock Critical Section Hold Generation due to Block- 45\nage For each identified gridlock critical section and for each\npair of opposite-direction aircraft competing for that critical\nsection where the Advisor has not previously issued a hold\nadvisory assigning a hold position for one of the vehicles as\npart of a previous pair-wise comparison, The Advisor will 50\nissue a hold advisory for the vehicle that is not occupying any\npart of the protected zone for the identified crossing critical\nsection when any part of the other vehicle occupies any part of\nthe protected zone for the identified crossing critical section\n(vertex polygon) at the current instant, as shown in FIG. 26. 55\nThe hold advisory will hold the vehicle at the applicable entry\npoint to the protected zone for this merging critical section.\nThe Advisor will also designate the aircraft being held in the\nissued hold advisory to be held in any other aircraft pair that\nhas a conflict for this gridlock critical section. Note the held 60\naircraft may be in numerous pairs that are conflicting for one\nor multiple critical sections. This step eliminates subsequent\nredundant assessments and prevents potentially contradictory\nhold assignments.\nResolution of Induced Potential Blockages\n65\nThe process for resolving induced potential blockages for\neach vehicle having a newly-assigned hold position in a hold\n\n22\nadvisory, the Advisor determines whether the hold position\nplaces any part of this vehicle in any part of a protected zone\n(i.e., the hold position causes intrusion of a protected zone),\nand where the newly-assigned hold position intrudes into\nanother protected zone and is at or forward of this vehicle\'s\ncurrent position, The Advisor issues a new hold advisory that\nreassigns the hold position for this vehicle to the vehicle\'s\nentry point into the intruded protected zone, as shown in FIG.\n27. The Advisor will also designate the aircraft being held in\nthe issued hold advisory to be held in any other aircraft pair\nthat has a conflict for the intruded critical section. Note the\nheld aircraft may be in numerous pairs that are conflicting for\none or multiple critical sections. This step eliminates subsequent redundant assessments and prevents potentially contradictory hold assignments. The Advisor repeats this step in the\nprocess until all induced potential blockages are eliminated\nfor this aircraft. Note this step resolves any propagation of a\nsuccession of induced blockages originating from a single\ninduced blockage.\nPrioritized Resolution of Unassigned Holds\nAt this point, if neither vehicle in the pair having an identified critical section has been assigned a hold position in a\nhold advisory in the Advisor processing, then neither vehicle\nis subject to blockage and neither vehicle has priority over the\nother. In this situation, both vehicles are potentially eligible to\nenter the critical section, which would lead to conflict if not\nresolved. For each identified critical section in which neither\nvehicle is being held at this point in current assessment session, the Advisor selects the vehicle with the highest priority\nby applying one or a series of user-defined prioritization\ncriteria (e.g., the closest aircraft to the critical section or the\naircraft having the earliest critical section estimated entry\ntime or combinations of selection criteria) and lets this\nvehicle proceed to or through the critical section without a\nhold as shown in FIG. 28. For all of the other vehicles having\na conflict for the use of the critical section, the Advisor issues\na hold advisory to hold the each of the other vehicles at the\nappropriate entry point to the protected zone for the identified\ncritical section.\nResolution of Induced Potential Blockages\nThe Advisor repeats the process for resolving induced\npotential blockages step shown in FIG. 27 for each aircraft\nhaving a newly-assigned hold until all induced potential\nblockages related to the newly-assigned holds are eliminated.\nIssue Hold Advisories\nUpon determining that all conflicts for critical sections are\nresolved (i.e., each section has zero or one un-held aircraft),\nthe Advisor issues hold advisories to traffic controllers. For\neach aircraft with at least one hold advisory, the Advisor\nissues only the first/earliest hold advisory along the aircraft\'s\npath.\nAdvanced Automated Surface Traffic Control System\nEmbodiment\nIn this embodiment, the Advisor is a hardware/software\ndecision support tool within an advanced automated surface\ntraffic control system.
