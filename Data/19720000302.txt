Unlike the thicker diamond-edged blades\nused for cutting hard materials, thin blades are more\nsensitive to cutting pressure and heat; as a result, the\nthin blades must be provided with better lubrication\nand operated at less cutting pressure, especially when\nthe blades cut into plastic embedments at 6500 rpm.\nFor use with thin blades, the machine was modified\nas follows: (1) A regulated water supply to the wheel\nwas installed and provision was made to recirculate\nthe water; (2) The water trough under the blade was\nenlarged and made of thicker plastic; (3) The rate of\ntable advance was halved by increasing the size of\nthe drive pulley; (4) The table support was changed\nto include grid markings and better clamps.\nConstant water pressure and abundant flow of\ncoolant water to prevent undue heating and blade\noscillation while cutting was supplied by a water tank\n\nsupported above the machine table; the water level\nin the tank was maintained constant by a float valve.\nThe water flow to the diamond wheel was further\nregulated by a second valve and then split by a forked\nstainless steel tube to provide three fine jets of water\non each side of the cutting blade; the water pressure\nwas regulated so as to assure equal and full runs of\nwater onto each side of the blade. (Water carried by\ncentrifugal force around the blade cools and lubricates\nthe specimen.)\nOrdinarily, the plastic-embedded bone specimen is\nmounted on a glass slide. The table support was\nmodified to provide secure clamping of the specimens;\na slide support, 5.08 cm by 15.24 cm with 0.538-cm\ngrid markings, was installed to permit alignment of\nthe . glass slide parallel to the cutting blade. Clamps\nwere made of slotted plastic with large-headed\nknurled-and-slotted clamping screws. A plastic wall\nwas attached to the edge of the water trough and the\noriginal splash guard was removed to provide access\nto the blade, to ease handling of the mounted specimens, and to permit retrieval of floating sections.\n\nNote:\nRequests for additional information may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nAmes Research Center\nMoffett Field, California 94035\nReference: TSP 72-10303\n\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: William W.
