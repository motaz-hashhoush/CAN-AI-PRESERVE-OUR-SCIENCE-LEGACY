The rHEALTH sensor is compact and portable, and it employs cutting-edge fluorescence detection optics, innovative microfluidics, and nanostrip reagents to perform a suite of hematology, chemistry, and biomarker assays from a single drop of blood. A handful of current portable POC devices provide generalized blood analysis, but they perform only a few tests at a time. These devices also rely on disposable components and depend on diverse detection technologies to complete routine tests-all ill-suited for space travelers on extended missions. In contrast, the rHEALTH sensor integrates sample introduction, processing, and detection with a compact, resource-conscious, and efficient design. Developed to monitor astronaut health on the International Space Station and during long-term space flight, this microscale lab analysis tool also has terrestrial applications that include POC diagnostics conducted at a patient's bedside, in a doctor's office, and in a hospital.", "title": "The Reusable Handheld Electrolyte and Lab Technology for Humans (rHEALTH) Sensor", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2016-04-26T17:30:50.0770000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20160005383, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chan, Eugene"}, "organization": {"name": "DNA Medicine Institute, Inc.", "location": "Boston, MA, United States"}}, "id": "19c18f301afe4e37b7b04e2f5e81cb03"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20160005383, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160005383, "id": "0241797a5d404ab49dd943cf40c342d7", "publicationName": "An Overview of SBIR Phase 2 Physical Sciences and Biomedical Technologies in Space", "publicationDate": "2015-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20150018401, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "An Overview of SBIR Phase 2 Physical Sciences and Biomedical Technologies in Space", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160005383.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160005383/downloads/20160005383.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160005383/downloads/20160005383.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160005383/downloads/20160005383.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
