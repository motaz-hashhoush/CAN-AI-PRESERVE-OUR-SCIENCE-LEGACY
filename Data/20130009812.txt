NPO47306\n\nAdaptive Phase Delay Generator\nTest facilities that need to synchronize test equipment with rotating machinery\ncould make use of this device.\nJohn H. Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThere are several experimental setups\ninvolving rotating machinery that require some form of synchronization.\nThe adaptive phase delay generator\n(APDG) \xe2\x80\x94 the Bencic-1000 \xe2\x80\x94 is a flexible instrument that allows the user to\ngenerate pulses synchronized to the rising edge of a tachometer signal from\nany piece of rotating machinery. These\nsynchronized pulses can vary by the\ndelay angle, pulse width, number of\npulses per period, number of skipped\npulses, and total number of pulses. Due\nto the design of the pulse generator,\nany and all of these parameters can be\nchanged independently, yielding an unparalleled level of versatility.\nThere are two user interfaces to the\nAPDG. The first is a LabVIEW program\nthat has the advantage of displaying all of\nthe pulse parameters and input signal\ndata within one neatly organized window\non the PC monitor. Furthermore, the\nLabVIEW interface plots the rpm of the\ntwo input signal channels in real time.\nThe second user interface is a handheld\nportable device that goes anywhere a\ncomputer is not accessible. It consists of\na liquid-crystal display and keypad, which\nenable the user to control the unit by\nscrolling through a host of command\nmenus and parameter listings.\nThe APDG combines all of the desired\nsynchronization control into one unit.\nThe experimenter can adjust the delay,\npulse width, pulse count, number of\nskipped pulses, and produce a specified\nnumber of pulses per revolution. Each\nof these parameters can be changed independently, providing an unparalleled\nlevel of versatility when synchronizing\n\n12\n\nThe construction of the Adaptive Phase Delay Generator allows for inclusion of multi-pulse functions\nby adding an expansion board to each channel.\n\nhardware to a host of rotating machinery. The APDG allows experimenters to\nset up quickly and generate a host of synchronizing configurations using a simple user interface, which hopefully leads\nto faster results.\nThe heart of the Bencic-1000 is a reconfigurable pulse-generating state machine that cycles through three to four\nprimary states, depending on the mode\nof operation. A second state machine\ntracks the period of the input signal by\nincorporating a latching synchronous\n32-bit counter and a microcontroller.\nThese hardware state machines make\n\nuse of high-speed CMOS technology,\nprimarily from the HC family of parts,\nand have no problem operating with the\n10-MHz master clock. The microcontroller is a 50-MHz 8051 derivative optimized to run at 50 MIPS.\nThis work was done by Lawrence Greer of\nGlenn Research Center.
