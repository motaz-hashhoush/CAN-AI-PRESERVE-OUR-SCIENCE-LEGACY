We present Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR) spectra of fragments from\nseveral stones of the meteorite.\nMethods and analysis: Infrared spectra of the\nsamples were recorded with a Nicolet iN10 MX FTIR\nmicroscope in the mid-IR range (4000\xe2\x80\x93675 cm-1; spectral\nresolution 4 cm-1). All samples were deposited on a clean\nglass slide, crushed with a stainless steel roller tool, and\nplaced directly on the focal plane of the microscope. IR\nspectra were collected by averaging 128 scans.\nResults: Preliminary IR spectra of the non-fusion\ncrust samples show mineral compositions that are\ndominated by phyllosilicates, carbonates, or mixtures of\nboth [2]. The carbonates display a dominant, broad band\ncentered at 1433 cm-1, with additional bands at 2515 cm-1,\n1797 cm-1, 882 cm-1, and 715 cm-1). Features associated\nwith phyllosilicates include a symmetric Si-O stretching\nmode band centered at 1011 cm-1 and several O-H\nstretching mode bands. The O-H shows up in two forms a broadband centered at 3415 cm-1 that is probably largely\ndue to adsorbed H2O and a much weaker, narrower feature\ncentered near 3680 cm-1 due to structural -OH.\nFeatures observed in the 2985\xe2\x80\x932855 cm-1 range\nsuggest the presence of aliphatic -CH3 and -CH2- groups.\nThe relative intensities of the bands in this range are\nsomewhat unusual. Typically, the asymmetric aliphatic CH stretching bands are stronger than the symmetric\nstretching bands, but in this case the reverse is true. This\nunusual pattern is well matched by the aliphatic features\nseen in the spectrum of a terrestrial calcite (CaCO3)\nstandard. This observation, and the fact that the strength\nof the carbonate and aliphatic bands seem to correlate,\nsuggest the organics are associated with the carbonates.\nConclusions: IR spectra of samples from the Sutter\xe2\x80\x99s\nMill meteorite show absorption features associated with\ncarbonates, phyllosilicates, and organics. Both the unusual\nband profile of the aliphatic C-H stretching mode bands\nand their correlation with the strength of the carbonate\nbands suggests the organics and the carbonates are\nassociated in some manner.\nReferences: [1] Jenniskens, P. et al.
