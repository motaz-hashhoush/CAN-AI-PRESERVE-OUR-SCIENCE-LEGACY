The primary goal of China-MAP was to assess the effects of economic development and the regional environmental changes it engenders upon agriculture in China. The project was carried out as part of the Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Protocol in the Atmospheric Sciences, an official government-to-government agreement that establishes the parameters for joint research projects between the two nations in the atmospheric sciences. The NASA-funded portion of the project focused on the development and application of a regional coupled climate/chemical transport model for East Asia (i.e., RegChem-CM). The funds provided under the subject 1-year project were used to: (1) complete specific investigations undertaken by the China-MAP Science Team using the Reg-Chem-CM expended; and (2) document the results of these and other China-MAP investigations in the peer-reviewed literature.
