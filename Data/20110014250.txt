b'SpaceX Dragon Air Circulation System\nBrenda J. Hernandez1 and Siarhei Piatrovich2\nSpace Exploration Technologies, Hawthorne, CA, 90250\nMauro Prina3\nSpace Exploration Technologies, Hawthorne, CA, 90250\n\nThe Dragon capsule is a reusable vehicle being developed by Space Exploration\nTechnologies (SpaceX) that will provide commercial cargo transportation to the\nInternational Space Station (ISS). Dragon is designed to be a habitable module while it is\nberthed to ISS. As such, the Dragon Environmental Control System (ECS) consists of\npressure control and pressure equalization, air sampling, fire detection, illumination, and an\nair circulation system. The air circulation system prevents pockets of stagnant air in Dragon\nthat can be hazardous to the ISS crew. In addition, through the inter-module duct, the air\ncirculation system provides fresh air from ISS into Dragon. To utilize the maximum volume\nof Dragon for cargo packaging, the Dragon ECS air circulation system is designed around\ncargo rack optimization. At the same time, the air circulation system is designed to meet the\nNational Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) inter-module and intra-module\nventilation requirements and acoustic requirements. A flight like configuration of the\nDragon capsule including the air circulation system was recently assembled for testing to\nassess the design for inter-module and intra-module ventilation and acoustics. The testing\nincluded the Dragon capsule, and flight configuration in the pressure section with cargo\nracks, lockers, all of the air circulation components, and acoustic treatment. The air\ncirculation test was also used to verify the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of\nthe Dragon capsule. The CFD model included the same Dragon internal geometry that was\nassembled for the test. This paper will describe the Dragon air circulation system design\nwhich has been verified by testing the system and with CFD analysis.\n\nNomenclature\nECS\nISS\nCFD\nCOTS\nTPS\nIMV\nSPL\nNC\nPFE\n\n1\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nEnvironmental Control System\nInternational Space Station\nComputational Fluid Dynamics\nCommercial Orbital Transportation Services\nThermal Protection System\nInter-Module Ventilation Duct\nSound Pressure Limit\nNoise Criterion\nPortable Fire Extinguisher\n\nECS Environmental Control System Engineer, Thermal, 1 Rocket Road Hawthorn, CA, and AIAA Member Grade\nfor first author.\n2\nEnvironmental Control System Engineer, Thermal, 1 Rocket Road Hawthorn, CA, and AIAA Member Grade for\nsecond author.\n3\nThermal Dynamics Manager, 1 Rocket Road Hawthorn, CA, and AIAA Member Grade for third author.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nI. Introduction\n\nD\n\nragon is a commercially developed reusable capsule developed by\nSpaceX under NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services\n(COTS) to deliver cargo to and from the International Space Station. Dragon\nconsists of a capsule with pressurized section and an unpressurized service\nsection for cargo and avionics, a trunk with a radiator and deploying solar\narray, and a nose cone to protect the ISS berthing ring during ascent. Figure 1\nshows the 1st demonstration Dragon that flew in a low Earth orbit in\nDecember 2010. The service section has the Dragon propulsion system and\navionics. The pressurized section contains avionics boxes, powered cargo and\nunpowered cargo. The entire pressure section and service section is covered\nwith thermal protection system (TPS) for insulation. The\nDragon\nair\ncirculation system includes a fan, ducting, inlet and outlet vents, air to liquid\nheat exchanger, accommodation for powered cargo and smoke detectors.\nAdditionally, the air circulation system was designed with consideration for\nnoise and includes acoustic treatment to reduce air borne noise. The air\ncirculation system test and CFD correlation and the acoustics testing are\ndiscussed herein.\nFigure 1.Dragon\n\nII. Dragon Pressure Section\nAs a cargo carrying vehicle, Dragon is capable of delivering 6000 kg of cargo to ISS and bring back 3000 kg to\nearth. For this reason the pressure section is mainly occupied by racks to hold cargo. There are a total of 9 cargo\nracks in Dragon. These include the floor deck that has lockers for storage, the aft rack, the starboard rack, the port\nrack, and the 4 late load racks. Figure 2 shows the interior of dragon with all the cargo rack except the port rack for\nclarity.\n\nFigure 2. Dragon Pressure Section Cargo Racks.\n\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAs is seen from figure 2, it is necessary to have an air circulation system that not only meets all the necessary\nrequirements, but is also capable of providing enough pressure given the allotted volume for the air duct and in\nconsideration of the fact that the capsule will be filled with avionics boxes, cargo and cargo racks that constrain air\nflow. The air circulation system consists of a fan, an air duct with inlet\nvents, an inter-module ventilation duct to provide fresh air to Dragon\nfrom ISS, air outlets on the floor rack, and a suite of sensors.\nAdditionally, recommendations were given for the cargo racks to have\nholes for air circulation purposes. Figure 3 shows the starboard rack with\nventilation holes and each rack also has large ventilations holes that\nmatch the outlet vents on the floor in order to have air move from the\nfloor vent to the inside of the cargo rack and to the center of the cabin.\nUltimately, the air circulation system was designed to provide a quiet\nand fresh air environment to the working crew inside the module. The\nderived requirements are captured in SSP 50808 COTS-ISS Interface\nRequirement Document for intra-module ventilation and inter-module\nventilation1. Air moving through the duct and air being pushed by the fan\nblades, naturally create noise that can be fairly loud. To maintain\nreasonable sound levels in the cabin, the environmental control system Figure 3. Starboard Cargo Rack\nwas treated with acoustics insulation to meet the NASA noise\nrequirements.\nA. Air Circulation Requirements & Habitability\nDragon is a cargo carrying capsule that requires ISS crew to be able to load and unload cargo comfortably. For\nthis reason, there are habitability requirements for air circulation inside Dragon, inter-module ventilation to provide\nfresh air from ISS and to limit noise (SSP 50808 COTS-ISS Interface Requirement Document1).\n1. Air Flow\nThere are inter and intra vehicle atmosphere requirements that were verified with testing and analysis. The air\nflow requirements ensure that the crew has ventilation that is comfortable while they unload and load cargo and also\nthat they are provided with sufficient fresh air from the ISS. Dragon does not have CO 2 removal equipment such as\nLiOH and therefore relies on ISS for CO2 scrubbing. The Inter-module Ventilation duct (IMV) connects from\nDragon to ISS to provide fresh air in Dragon. The specific requirements that ensure adequate ventilation and\ndelivery of fresh air are described below\n\na.\n\nAtmosphere Circulation\n\nFor cargo variants of Dragon, the air velocity through 2/3 of\nthe internal cabin habitable volume excluding the layer 6\ninches from the cabin aisle way surfaces shall be between\n10feet/min and 40 feet/min. To avoid pockets of stagnant air,\nair velocities outside the layer 6 inches from the cabin aisle\nway surfaces averaging less than 7feet/min shall not sum to\nequal a volume larger than 5% of the total internal cabin\nvolume (schematic representation in Figure 4).\n\nb.\n\nInter-module Atmosphere Receive Rate\n\nThe IMV volumetric flow shall be maintained between 135 and\n210 cubic feet/min for normal operation with the COTS vehicle\nhatch open.\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFlow: 10 \xe2\x80\x93 40 ft/min\n67 % of\nVolume\nDragon Spacecraft\nInternal Volume\n\n> 6 inches from\nCabin Isle way\nSurfaces\n\n~ 28 % of\nVolume\n\n5 % of\nVolume\n\n7 < Flow < 10 ft/min\nFlow > 40 ft/min\n\nFlow < 7 ft/min\n\nFigure 4. Intra-Vehicle Circulation Requirement\n2. Acoustics Requirements\nThe acoustics environment was evaluated with testing to show the ISS crew is able to hear each other while\ninside Dragon as well as the ISS alarms in case of an emergency. Additionally, the acoustic noise at the IMV duct\nwas evaluated to ensure that the noise in Node 2 and in the proximity to where the ISS crew sleeping quarters are\nlocated was acceptable. Inside Dragon the noise criterion is NC-50 which is comparable to the noise down an office\nhallway. The noise outside Dragon in Node 2 due to the inter-module ventilation duct must be at or below NC-40\nwhich is comparable to noise in a library. These requirements allow for adequate habitability while working inside\nDragon.\n\nFigure 5. Air Circulation Fan\n\nB. Air Circulation System Accommodation in the Pressure Section\nThe air circulation system in Dragon is provided by a fan (Figure 5) that can delivers over 400 CFM to maintain\nthe required air speeds inside the capsule while sucking sufficient air from the IMV duct. The fan can be power at\ndifferent speeds to provide up to 1800 CFM at relatively low noise levels. Having the option of varying the fan\nspeed allows the freedom to tune in air flow and noise levels on the system to keep the system within the reasonable\nboundaries set by the constrains aforementioned.\nThe fan is mounted to the Dragon forward wall structure above the floor rack and has a shroud that surrounds its\noutlet and an inlet. The duct leading to the floor opens up into a larger area where a suite of sensors reside. Figure 6\nshows Dragon capsule model with structure removed to show the cargo racks, floor, and duct. Figure 7 shows\nDragon capsule model with the racks removed to show the duct and the floor with outlet vents more clearly.\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 6. Dragon capsule model with the\nStructure removed.\n\nFigure 7. Dragon capsule with Structure &\nCargo Removed\n\nThe plenum under the floor is defined by the perimeter of the basement lockers, the floor, and the cylindrical\nDragon walls underneath the floor. Air from the plenum is then pushed up to the cabin through air circulation vents\non the floor (Figure 7).\nThe floor has a total of eight outlet vents. Four outlet vents are located along the perimeter of the floor, with one\noutlet vent underneath the structure of each main rack (Aft, Forward, Starboard, and Port) and four additional vents\nare located in the center of the floor (Figure 8). For the ISS crew comfort, the air is pushed up to the floor vents in\npotential locations where the crew can be loading and unloading cargo.\nIn the cabin, as the air moves upward, some of the air returns to the main duct through inlet vents (Figure 9) that\nthen takes the air back to the fan. The rest of the air mixes with Node 2 air through the open hatch. There are 3inches\n\nFigure 8. Outlet Vents on the Floor\ninlet diameter vents along the main duct. Also, the main duct is connected to the powered cargo adapter plate\nthrough a 4 inches diameter duct. When powered cargo is removed the inlets on the adapter plate suck air from the\npressure section into the main duct. The main duct inlet vents and the powered cargo inlet vents are lined with a fine\nwire mesh. In addition to this fine wire mesh, the inlet vents have a rock catching screen with wide screen holes\n(Figure 9).\nThe IMV duct is connected to the Dragon main duct and to the ISS air circulation system to provide fresh air in\nDragon. Connecting the IMV will be one of the 1st steps done during ingress. This duct will be provided by SpaceX\nand is a 5\xe2\x80\x9d diameter duct that connects to the Aft side of the main duct and in close proximity to the fan. Figure 9\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nshows a picture of the IMV. On the Node 2 side it will be\nmated using a V-band clamp and on the Dragon side, it is\nmated with a quick connection. The aft side of the main duct\nhas a latching door that can be simply opened with the tabs at\nthe end of the IMV.\nIn case of a fire while berthed to ISS, the crew will\nextinguish the fire with a portable fire extinguisher (PFE).\nTwo sources of fire are the fan and the powered cargo. Both\nof these are along the air circulation duct and as such, there is\na PFE port placed on the duct and approximately a foot away\nfrom the fan so that when the PFE is fired the CO2 goes\ndirectly to these fire sources. CFD analysis has shown that it\nwould take 10 seconds to extinguish a fire at the powered\ncargo and less than that to extinguish a fire at the fan.\nFigure 9. View of Duct with Inlet Vents Inside\nThe Dragon ECS also has a suite of sensors . The sensors\nDragon Pressure Section\nthat pertain to the air\ncirculation system\nare temperature sensors, humidity sensors and smoke detectors. These are\nall within the duct or in close proximity to the duct to make sure they are in\nthe air flow stream. Using CFD, it was verified that downstream from the\nfan and before reaching the plenum below the floor, there is a good air flow\nstream. Therefore, the 2 smoke detectors and 2 humidity & temperature\nsensors reside at this location and an additional humidity sensor and\ntemperature sensor was placed upstream of the fan.\nThe smoke detector is functional in natural-convection since it is a\nphotoelectric device that uses light scattering effect to determine if there is\nsmoke. When a beam of light passes through a space occupied by the\nsmoke particles, the incident light (generated by the smoke detector) will be\nscattered off from the axis of the projected light beam. The intensity of this Figure 10. Dragon Smoke Detector\nlight scatter will trigger a smoke alarm. In addition to having the ability to Unit\ndetect smoke, the detector also does a self-health check and reports health\nand whether smoke has been detected. A fire alarm will be announced when a detector is healthy and has detected\nsmoke. Figure 10 shows the two smoke detectors in one box going through flight qualification.\n\nC. Acoustics Considerations\nThe air circulation system that provides the required atmosphere inherently creates an acoustic environment and\nconsideration of this was included in the design to allow the crew to work continuously in a safe and quiet\nenvironment, as captured by the NASA acoustic requirements1. The acoustics environment established by the\nrequired air flow has been evaluated inside Dragon and at the IMV inlet.\nThe primary item taken into consideration from an acoustics standpoint was the fan. The Dragon fan generates\nmaximum sound at lower frequencies and is quieter at higher frequencies (69 dBA when operating at maximum\npower and providing 1800 CFM). The fan is mounted on isolators to reduce vibration. Since it is not required that\nthe fan be used at its maximum power because the necessary volumetric flow rate is less than the capability of this\nfan, the noise level is naturally lower but not sufficient to meet the required specification. Therefore, the air duct has\nbeen acoustically treated, as well as the floor, and the capsule walls. The part that received more attention is the fan\nshroud, where the source of noise is located.\n\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAssessment of Foam for Fan Shroud\n25\n\nAttenuation, dB\n\nThe acoustic treatment design on the shroud &\ninlet was done using a material with high\ntransmission loss and also good absorption. The\n20\nsizing of the acoustic treatment was accomplished\nusing a VAOne component level model to assess the\nattenuation of different materials. The VAOne model\n15\nconsisted of a source cavity and a receiver cavity\n1" Polyimide\nseparated by a partition. The partition could be varied\n0.1" Bisco\nin material properties, thickness and even a layup of\n10\nseveral different types of materials could also be\n0.1" Bisco & 1" Polyimide\ncreated. Prior to running the VAOne model, sound\npressure level measurements were taken with a sound\n5\nlevel meter at the fan and these measurements were\nused at the source cavity in the VAOne model. This\nmodel was not used to assess the absolute noise of the\nfan but to assess how the acoustic treatment of the\n0\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\nshroud could be selected and sized. The materials\nFrequency, Hz\nassessed were Bisco sound blocker and polyimide\nFigure 11. Assessment of Various Acoustic Foam Layup open-cell foam as have been evaluated in past studies\non Fan Shroud/Inlet\nfor the ISS crew sleeping quarters2. Several\nthicknesses of the Bisco and polyimide foam were\ncompared taking into consideration the space around\nthe shroud for foam. The plot in Figure 11 shows three of the\nmany configurations that were considered. This plot shows that\nconsidering the available space around the fan shroud, the\noptimal solution is to have 1" of Polyimide foam and at least 0.1"\nof Bisco on the exterior of the fan shroud. The sound blocking\nBisco reduces transmissibility of the noise generated by the fan,\nand the open cell foam was used for absorption. The sound\nblocker and open cell foam were placed on the exterior of the\nshroud and fan inlet cover Polycarbonate Bisco\nPolyimide\nNomex\nin order to not interfere\nwith the air flow inside. Figure 12. Foam Layers on Fan Shroud and\nThe exterior of the rest of Inlet Cover\nthe duct was lined with 1"\nof polyimide foam to reduce air born noise inside the duct. Figure 12 shows\nthe layers of the Bisco and polyimide foam on the fan shroud and inlet that\nwill be used for flight.\nIn addition to treating the fan shroud and inlet acoustically, there is an\nacoustic blanket placed over the inlet cover (the area between the fan inlet &\nFigure 13. Fan Acoustic Blanket\nshroud). For testing, the blanket was made with Bisco (1.0 psf) and\npolyimide foam, and Kevlar was used to encapsulate the polyimide foam, as\nshown in Figure 13. For flight, the Kevlar will be replaced with Nomex for materials & processing purposes.\nAs discussed previously, the air pushed by the fan creates a plenum underneath the floor. The bottom side of the\nfloor was lined with 1" thick polyimide foam to absorb noise coming from the air flow in the plenum. The flight unit\nconsists of an aluminum honeycomb floor and any gaps between the floor and the Dragon structure will be sealed\nwith polyimide foam as well.\nAdditionally, the Dragon walls were lined with 1" thick polyimide foam to increase the reverberation time in\norder to reduce echo inside the capsule. Polyimide foam was selected due to its absorptive acoustic properties and\nsince it is acceptable by NASA material standards.\nD. Air Circulation System Development Testing\nThe ventilation and acoustics testing of the air circulation system were done with the same test set up and\nconfiguration. The set up was done inside the Dragon qualification unit that has the same structure as the Dragon\nthat will go to ISS and included all the flight like interior components necessary for these tests. The Dragon pressure\nsection was fitted with flight like cargo racks, an aluminum honeycomb panel floor with basement lockers and outlet\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nvents, an air duct with inlet vents, a fan, accommodation for the powered cargo and the stowed forward hatch. As in\nthe flight configuration, the fan was mounted above the floor with a shroud at the outlet, the duct leading to the floor\nopens up into a larger area. Figure 6 previously discussed shows Dragon with structure removed to show the cargo\nracks, floor, and duct.\nThe floor included the eight flight-like outlet vents and was supported by beams that were connected to the\nisogrid structure underneath the floor. Foam was placed in the gaps between the floor and the Dragon structure to\nprevent air and noise from leaking out from underneath the floor as in the flight unit. Foam was also placed\nunderneath the floor surface. The side hatch was closed and included the powered cargo adaptor plate. The test setup simulated an empty Dragon case with the powered cargo removed.\nThis test configuration also included the IMV prototype duct and latching door to simulate inter-module\nventilation from ISS Node 2.\n3. CFD Model\nThe CFD model includes all of the items that are part of the Dragon capsule, such as the Dragon structure, floor\nwith outlet vents, main air duct with inlet vents, fan, plenum, all of the cargo racks, and the powered cargo adapter\nduct. The purpose of the Air Circulation CFD model is to analyze the Dragon capsule air circulation with all\nappropriate hardware. The CFD model was correlated against the test air speed spot checks using the same\nconfiguration. Additionally, the CFD model results are used as a method of choosing locations for air speed spot\nchecks on the vehicle. Now that the CFD model is correlated, the model is used for verification of the air circulation\nrequirements and for air flow predictions of the Dragon capsule air circulation system with additional hardware,\nsuch as cold plates with avionics boxes, various passive cargo configurations, etc. The description of the air\ncirculation CFD model that was used to correlate with testing is provided below.\nThe CFD model geometry represents Dragon capsule test configuration and includes flow-critical elements, such\nas cabin interior surfaces, cabin floor with 8 outlet vents, cargo racks, forward hatch opening, main duct with inlet\nvents, powered cargo adapter plate, IMV duct and forward hatch\n(Figure 6). The duct inlet vents are modeled as openings in the duct,\nand the floor vents are modeled as openings in the floor (Figure 14).\nIt is ensured that there are no air leaks between the plenum under the\nfloor and the interior Figure 15. Floor Vent Model\nDragon volume, other\nthan through the floor vents.\nIn order to verify the results of the CFD model against air speed\nrequirements inside the Dragon internal volume, a volume within the\nDragon model was created to represent the volume 6" away from all\ninternal surfaces (Figure 15). This volume was later used to create a\nhistogram showing the volume percent at different speeds.\nThe CFD model geometry creates an enclosed volume of air. This\nvolume was used for the\nCFD\nmeshing\nand\nsimulation using ANSYS\nCFX. The air volume\nmesh contains\nover a\nmillion elements, with\nmaximum\nelement\nFigure 14. Internal Volume 6" Away\ncharacteristic length of\nfrom Surfaces\n0.10m, and minimum\ncharacteristic length of .003m (Figure 16), with an average mesh\nquality greater than 0.8 and a standard deviation lower than 0.1.\nIncreased mesh resolution was used near internal surfaces and in highspeed flow regions where large velocity gradients are expected. The\nturbulence model used is k-epsilon, with scalable wall function. The\nformulation does not require resolution of viscous sub-layer, and is\ncapable of properly handling flow separation regions. The boundary Figure 16. Air Volume Mesh\nconditions were specified on the surfaces shown in Figure 17 at the\nfan, open hatch and IMV. The fan outlet was set to provide 465 CFM\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nvolumetric flow by specifying the tangential and normal velocity. The volumetric flow rate set was the value\nobserved during testing. The volumetric flow rate at the fan inlet is set to be equal to volumetric flow rate at the fan\noutlet. The total pressure at the IMV inlet and the environmental pressure\nat the hatch opening are set to 1 atm. Second order double precision\nturbulence solver with automatic pseudo time stepping was used to obtain\nthe numerical solution. During the run, normalized residuals were\nmonitored to measure local imbalances of the linearized system of\nequations at each control volume. The model was set to run for up to 1200\niterations, with a minimum convergence criterion. In addition, the static\npressures at both fan inlet and outlet were monitored, and the run was\nstopped when the flow pressures on fan boundaries were stabilized.\nFigure 17. CFD Model Boundaries\n4. Air Circulation Test\nThe purpose of testing the air circulation system was to correlate the CFD model. In order to correlate the model,\nair speed measurements were taken at specific locations. First, a volumetric flow balance was verified. Air speed\nand volumetric flow measurements were taken at all the outlets on the floor and all the inlets on the duct and IMV\nand at the inlet of the fan with two anemometers. For air speeds above 500 ft/min, a 0-6000 ft/min anemometer was\nused and for air speeds below 500 ft/min an omnidirectional air speed transducer was used. Pressure was also taken\nat the fan inlet and the IMV with a 0 to 1 inch of water pressure gauge.\nAfter the air balance was completed for a fan speed of 1200 rpm, it was determined that 465 CFM was delivered\nby the fan. The testing then involved taking air speeds spot checks in locations inside the cabin where the CFD\nindicated stability, in order to increase the chances of having precise measurements. The air speed spot checks were\ntaken with the omnidirectional anemometer that read speeds between 0-100 ft/min and has an accuracy of +/-3.0%\nof reading & +/-1.0% selected scale range.\nThe results of the CFD model simulation were compared to test measurements in the same Dragon capsule\nconfiguration. First, the volumetric flow rates were verified by performing air spot velocity measurements next to\nthe floor outlet vents and main duct vents, respectively. The velocity measurements for each vent were averaged and\nmultiplied by the vent area. The results of test-based volumetric flow rate calculation and their comparison to the\nCFD model predictions is shown in Table 1. As can be seen, the CFD model volumetric flow rate agrees well with\nthe test measurements. This is to be expected, since the CFD model was ran at 465CFM based on preliminary test\ndata.\nThe next step was to compare the volumetric flow rate predicted by CFD model through each of the floor outlets\nand each of the main duct inlets to the test measurements. The results of the comparison are shown in Table 2 for\nfloor outlets and Table 3 for main duct inlets. The comparison shows that the CFD model gives at most a +14%/15% error for the floor outlet vents compared to test data, and +17%/-16% error for the main duct inlets. It should be\nTable 1.

These were compared to air spot measurement data\ntaken at the same altitudes. Figure 19, Figure 20, Figure 21 and\nFigure 22 show contour plots of air velocities at different altitudes\nalong with the test measurements. The points where velocity\ncomparisons were made are labeled, and both CFD and\nmeasurements results along with standard deviation are shown.\nMost of the velocities from CFD results are within standard\ndeviation of test measurements, except points 1B, 3D, 5A, 5C and\n6A, which are within two standard deviations.\nFigure 18.

Figure 23 shows the histogram of volumetric air velocity distribution inside the 6\xe2\x80\x9d interior volume. The\nregions of velocity in the range 0-7ft/min occupy only 1% of internal flow, thus eliminating threat of pockets of\nstagnant air inside the capsule. Most of the volume (74%) has velocities between 10 and 70ft/min which is\nacceptable because according to the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers\n(ASHRAE) standards for human comfort, the majority of humans are comfortable up to 250 ft/min.\nCFD Dragon Air Speed\n60\n\n56\n\n50\n\n% Volume\n\n40\n\n30\n\n18\n\n20\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n0\nFlow < 7\n\n7 < Flow < 10\n\n10 < Flow < 40\n\n40 < Flow < 70\n\n70 < Flow < 100\n\n100 < Flow < 150\n\n150 < Flow < 200\n\nAir Speed, ft/min\n\nFigure 23.Volumetric air velocity distribution histogram\n\nF.

The acoustic\ntreatment that was previously mentioned around the fan\nshroud and inlet was also included. The acoustic testing\ninvolved taking noise measurement inside the capsule with the\nfan on at the nominal speed. A sound level meter was used to\nmeasure noise at 6 locations: inside the port, aft, starboard,\nlate load rack and at the center of the capsule at 3 ft above the\nfloor and one measurement at the center of the capsule at 5 ft\nabove the floor. These were all deemed location were an ISS\ncrew could potentially be while unloading cargo. One octave\nmeasurements were taken at each of these locations and the\naverage of these was taken to assess if the continuous noise\nrequirement was met. Figure 24 shows the resultant average\nnoise measurement. The measurements showed that the class\n1 alarm for emergencies would be heard and although the NC-\n\nFigure 24.

The noise measured at 0.6 m from the IMV is required to be at or below NC40. In order to have a valid test the background noise needs to be at least 3 dB below NC-40. It would essentially\nrequire moving Dragon to a quite environment like a library or an anechoic chamber.\nTo perform a test like this in an\nanechoic chamber would be very\nexpensive and for this reason an anechoic\nlike box was built to take this\nmeasurement locally at the IMV. The 3 ft\nx 2 ft x 2 ft box made of 0.5" wood and\nlined internally with 2" of SoundCoat\nfoam on the inside was used to reduce the\nbackground noise at the location that the\nIMV noise measurements were taken.\nSoundCoat foam was preferred to\npolyimide foam because it is 3 times\nFigure 25. Anechoic Box to Take IMV Noise Measurements\ndenser. Additionally, to get reduced\nstanding waves, 4" wedges of foam were\nadded on top of the SoundCoat foam. The box has a hole for the IMV at the bottom of the box and forty 1\xe2\x80\x9d holes at\nthe top of the box for air flow to the IMV and to insert the microphone and measure sound pressure level with the\nsound level meter. Figure 25 shows the interior & exterior of the anechoic like box.\nFigure 26 shows a plot of\nthe background noise outside\nBackground Noise Measurements\n80\nof the box and the\nNC-30\nbackground noise inside the\nNC-40\nNC-50\nbox.

The 2dB uncertainty includes\ninstrumentation, repeatability, and human error (positioning).\n\n14\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nIMV Noise with Fan On at 5.5 V (Oct 31, 2010)\n80\nNC40\nNC50\n\n70\n\n1200 rpm\n60\n\nSLP (dB)\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n60\n\n600\nFrequency (Hz) - Octave\n\n6000\n\nFigure 27.

Conclusion\nThe air circulation test and CFD results show that the ECS air circulation design meets the inter-vehicle\nrequirements. The air speed spot checks show that the results predicted by the CFD model are comparable when\ntaken in the same locations. Additionally, since the spot check and CFD are comparable, there is confidence in the\nCFD predictions and the model is considered correlated to the test data. The CFD model is now used for verification\nof air circulation inter and intra vehicle requirements.\nUpon verification of the intra-vehicle circulation using the CFD, it was confirmed that atmosphere circulation\nrequirement is met at low air speeds of < 7 ft/min since these make up only 3 % of the cabin volume and the\nrequirement is to have < 5% low air speeds ( < 7 ft/min) of the cabin volume. The air speeds between 10 ft/min and\n40 ft/min make up 58 % of the cabin volume, as opposed to the 67 % requirement. However, this is due to the fact\nthat the air speeds in the cabin are higher than required. Since the majority of the air speeds that are higher than 40\nft/min are lower than 70 ft/min (20 %), it is considered to be acceptable for crew comfort while at the same time\nprovides plenty of air mixing to decrease the chances of stagnation pockets that could be hazardous to the crew. As\nmention previously, the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)\nstandards for human comfort, the majority of humans are comfortable up to 250 ft/min\nDevelopment acoustics testing showed that the IMV noise was acceptable at the nominal fan speed of 1200 rpm\nsince the significant exceedance to the NC-40 requirement was at 125 Hz. In discussions with NASA, it was deemed\nacceptable because at this frequency there are no significant additional noises in Node 2 of ISS that would aggregate\nto this exceedance. A lower fan speed was assessed during the acoustics test to reduce continuous noise. The CFD\nwas run at lower fan speeds as well for comparison at a fan speed of 1150 rpm and 1100 rpm. The CFD results\nshowed that by lowering the fan speed, the IMV and Powered Cargo air flow requirements would be marginally\nmet. Since the alarms are still expected to be audible with the nominal fan speed of 1200 rpm, and lowering the fan\nspeed would only lower the noise by 1dB to 2 dB, the fan speed of 1200 rpm will be kept. The development tests\nshowed that the air circulation design is acceptable from an acoustics stand point and provides sufficient air\ncirculation.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe Dragon air circulation design, testing and development described in this paper was accomplished by the\nwork and effort of many SpaceX engineers, designers, analysts, and technicians and by the knowledge and\nexperiences that NASA ECLS shared about the ISS air circulation system.\n\nReferences\n1\n\nFrancis, D., and Cox, B., \xe2\x80\x9cInternational Space Station Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Interface Document,\xe2\x80\x9d\nNASA SSP 50808, 2009.\n2\nBroyan, J., \xe2\x80\x9cInternational Space Station Crew Quarters Ventilation and Acoustic Design Implementation,\xe2\x80\x9d AIAA\nInternational Conference on Environmental Control Systems, AIAA, Barcelona, Spain, 2010-6018.\n\n16\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n'
