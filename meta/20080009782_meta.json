Human capabilities, skills, and needs must be considered early in the design and development process, and must be continuously considered throughout the development lifecycle. This integration of human needs within system design is typically formalized through a Human-Systems Integration (HSI) program. By having an HSI program, an institution or organization can reduce lifecycle costs and increase the efficiency, usability, and quality of its products because human needs have been considered from the beginning.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20080009782, "endDate": "2008-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Human Research Program Investigators'' Workshop", "location": "League City, TX", "id": "d5c599225fc048f09e5f676d3ef9688d", "startDate": "2008-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080009782, "id": "a6cc2836c9f947ecb19d1ac5dbfeb886", "publicationDate": "2008-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080009782.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080009782/downloads/20080009782.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080009782/downloads/20080009782.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080009782/downloads/20080009782.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
