b'Acoustic Liquid Manipulation Used to\nEnhance Electrochemical Processes\nWorking in concert with the NASA Technology Transfer and Partnership Office, the\nGreat Lakes Industrial Technology Center, and Alchemitron Corporation of Elgin,\nIllinois, the NASA Glenn Research Center has applied nonlinear acoustic principles to\nindustrial applications.\nHigh-intensity ultrasonic beam techniques employ the effects of acoustic radiation\npressure and acoustic streaming to manipulate the behavior of liquids. This includes\npropelling liquids, moving bubbles, and ejecting liquids as droplets and fountains. Since\nthese effects can be accomplished without mechanical pumps or moving parts, we are\nexploring how these techniques could be used to manipulate liquids in space applications.\nSome of these acoustic techniques could be used both in normal Earth gravity and in the\nmicrogravity of space.\nThe electroplating process is one Earth-based industry that benefits from the\nmanipulation of liquids. Collaborating with Alchemitron Corporation, we adapted an\nacoustic transducer to create acoustic streaming in a tank of gold electroplating\nelectrolyte typically used in the manufacture of electronic circuit boards.\nNormally, the selective plating process uses masking tapes or coatings to distinguish the\nsurface areas selected to be plated and to protect nonselected areas. Masking is the most\nlabor- and tooling-intensive aspect of the plating process, and the subsequent removal\nand disposal of masking materials often becomes a source of toxic waste. The substantial\ncost, health, and environmental issues motivate us to eliminate the masking process.\nIn a normal electroplating process, the depletion of the electrolyte in the immediate\nvicinity of the part impedes the process, so agitation is typically used to keep fresh\nelectrolyte in contact with the part. In contrast, the acoustically enhanced process treats\nthis depleted electrolyte envelope as a virtual mask and uses an acoustically driven liquid\njet to penetrate the envelope with fresh electrolyte. The plating rate in the area defined by\nthe acoustic beam is dramatically higher, and it appears that further refinement of the\nprocess may yield a mask-free process.\nIn our most recent work, we sought to improve the efficiency of acoustic streaming,\nwhich was believed to be the main mechanism for the enhanced plating. This was done\nby increasing the acoustic frequency from 2 to 45 MHz. In addition, we employed a\nSchlieren imaging system to observe the streaming process. As shown in the photograph,\nacoustic streaming can form a distinct and unusually long laminar flow. Surprisingly, the\nenhanced streaming did not improve the deposition. Further study revealed that the beam\nreflection observed at lower frequencies contributes to defining a distinct plating area.\nThis finding also implies that acoustic phased arrays (common in medical ultrasound)\ncould now be employed to dramatically improve the process by providing dynamic beam\n\nsteering and focusing. Future development will involve flexible beam control to perform\nselective plating by scanning the acoustic beam and \xe2\x80\x9cpainting\xe2\x80\x9d preprogrammed plating\npatterns without masks. This development is covered by U.S. Patent 6,368,982 and is\navailable for licensing by commercial users.\n\nSchlieren image of an acoustic transducer producing acoustic streaming.\nLong description of figure.
