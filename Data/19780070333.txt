Telescope, astronomers should be able to\nobserve some 350 times the volume of space that can be seen\nnow with the largest ground-based telescope.\n\nOnce placed in orbit, the telescope will be operated\nremotely from the ground.\n\nHowever, it will be designed to\n\npermit maintenance and the change of instruments by a spacesuited astronaut and to be retrievable by the Space Shuttle\nfor return to Earth for extensive overhaul and subsequent\nrelaunch.\n\nThese features should allow the Space Telescope\n\nto serve as an in-space astronomical observatory for more\nthan a decade.\n\nThe 2.4-meter\n\n(8-foot)-diameter Space Telescope will be\n\ncapable of accommodating five different instruments at its\nfocal plane.\n\nThe observatory will weigh 9,100 kilograms\n\n(10 tons) and will orbit the Earth at an altitude of approximately 500 kilometers (310 miles), above the obscuring\neffects of the atmosphere.\n\nIt will thus be available to\n\nall astronomers for observations which cannot br made from\nthe surface of the Earth.\n\nScientists have been chosen to head teams to participate\nindividually in a variety of categories as follows:\n-more-^\n\n-3-\n\nInvestigatlons Definition Teams;\n\nThese teams consist of\n\nprincipal investigators, co-investigators and supporting\nstaffs who will design and develop the focal plane scientific\ninstruments.\n\nThey will also carry out major scientific\n\ninvestigations.\n\nIndividual Co-Investigators;\n\nThese are scientists who\n\nhad not been affiliated with an investigation definition team\nprior to selection but who will be assigned to a team now.\n\nAstrometry Science Team;\n\nThis team will be responsible\n\nfor assuring that the fine guidance system will adequately\nperform astrometric functions as required.\n\nU.S. Members of European Space Agency Faint Object Camera\nInstrument Science Team; The two U.S. members chosen will\nrepresent the American astronomical community.\n\nTelescope Scientists;\n\nTwo scientists have been chosen\n\nwith strong backgrounds in optical instrumentation.\n\nThey\n\nwill be responsible for interpreting the scientific performance requirements in terms of telescope design specifications.\n\n-more-\n\n-4Data and Operations Team Leader;\n\nWill lead a team of\n\nrepresentatives appointed by each principal investigator to\nreview or establish requirements and specifications for\ninstrument control systems, flight operations and ground\ndata handling systems.\n\nInterdisciplinary Scientists;\n\nDesigned to give breadth\n\nto the guidance of the Space Telescope Project beyond the\nconcerns of the individual principal investigators and the\ntechnical specialists.\n\nThe four chosen will be responsible\n\nfor a broad scientific overview of the observatory's\ndevelopment.\n\nInvestigators selected by NASA, their respective institutions and their areas are:\n\nPrincipal Investigators\n\nInstitution\n\nArea or Team\n\nDr. James Westphal\n\nCalifornia Institute\nof Technology\n\nWide Field Camera\nTeam\n\nDr. Richard Harms\n\nUniversity of\nFaint Object SpectroCalifornia, San Diego scopy Team Leader\n\nDr. John Brandt\n\nGoddard Space\nFlight Center\n\nHigh Resolution Spectroscopy Team Leader\n\nDr. Robert Bless\n\nUniversity of\nWisconsin\n\nHigh Speed Photometry Team Leader\n\n-more-\n\n- 5 Principal Investigators\n\nInstitutions\n\nArea or Team\n\nDr. William H.
