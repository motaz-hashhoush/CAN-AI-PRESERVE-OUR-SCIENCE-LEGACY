b'Submission for DASC 2010\nOperational Dynamic Configuration Analysis\nChok Fung Lai and Shannon Zelinski\n\nAbstract\nSectors may combine or split within areas of specialization in response to changing\ntraffic patterns. This method of managing capacity and controller workload could be\nmade more flexible by dynamically modifying sector boundaries. Much work has been\ndone on methods for dynamically creating new sector boundaries [1-5]. Many\nassessments of dynamic configuration methods assume the current day baseline\nconfiguration remains fixed [6-7]. A challenging question is how to select a dynamic\nconfiguration baseline to assess potential benefits of proposed dynamic configuration\nconcepts.\nBloem used operational sector reconfigurations as a baseline [8]. The main difficulty is\nthat operational reconfiguration data is noisy. Reconfigurations often occur frequently to\naccommodate staff training or breaks, or to complete a more complicated reconfiguration\nthrough a rapid sequence of simpler reconfigurations. Gupta quantified a few aspects of\nairspace boundary changes from this data [9]. Most of these metrics are unique to sector\ncombining operations and not applicable to more flexible dynamic configuration\nconcepts. To better understand what sort of reconfigurations are acceptable or beneficial,\nmore configuration change metrics should be developed and their distribution in current\npractice should be computed.\nThis paper proposes a method to select a simple sequence of configurations among\noperational configurations to serve as a dynamic configuration baseline for future\ndynamic configuration concept assessments. New configuration change metrics are\napplied to the operational data to establish current day thresholds for these metrics. These\nthresholds are then corroborated, refined, or dismissed based on airspace practitioner\nfeedback.\nThe dynamic configuration baseline selection method uses a k-means clustering\nalgorithm to select the sequence of configurations and trigger times from a given day of\noperational sector combination data. The clustering algorithm selects a simplified\nschedule containing k configurations based on stability score of the sector combinations\namong the raw operational configurations. In addition, the number of the selected\nconfigurations is determined based on balance between accuracy and assessment\ncomplexity.\n\nThis method was used to select a dynamic configuration baseline for Kansas City Center\n(ZKC) for a good weather, high volume day. A total of 78 configurations were used at\nsome time in Kansas City Center on February 8, 2007. The clustering algorithm was\napplied to the 78 configuration schedule with k ranging from one to six. Preliminary\nresults show that the overall stability score improves rapidly until the three-configuration\nschedule. For this day, the three-configuration schedule yields the best accuracy for the\nincreased scenario complexity, and the two configuration triggering times are 2007/02/08\n12:19:21 UTC and 2007/02/09 00:58:07 UTC.\nThe final version of this paper will include an analysis of reconfiguration metrics applied\nto operational configurations. These metrics include quantities of airspace volume and\naircraft changing ownership during the change, number of sector pairs affected by the\nchange, and resulting change in airspace complexity metrics.\nIt is impractical to assume a single sector configuration can balance controller workload\nand accommodate dynamic air traffic demand. By providing the most representative set\nof configurations and allowing multiple configurations to be triggered during a\nsimulation, it has the potential to improve benefit assessment accuracy for new dynamic\nairspace designs.\nReferences\n[1] Hoffman, R., Yousefi, A., Mitchell, J., Sabhnani, G., and Krozel, J.

A method is used to select a sequence\nof configurations and trigger times from the\noperational sector combination data. The selection\nprocess considers two key characteristics of sector\ncombining and splitting operations: controller\nfamiliarity and sector continuity. Based on a distance\nscore, the method selects three representative\nconfigurations. Configurations selected from the\nclustering algorithm were compared with the actual\noperational configurations. The main findings of the\nstudy were: 1) on average 2.8 sectors were changed\nat each reconfiguration event, 2) on average, after a\nreconfiguration about two aircraft were handed-off,\ntwo aircraft were received, and five aircraft remained\nin the sector, and 3) aircraft density change is the best\nsector change metric to access new dynamic airspace\ndesigns using a simplified reconfiguration.\n\nI. Introduction\nAir traffic managers and controllers combine or\nsplit air traffic sectors in response to changing traffic\npatterns. This method of managing capacity and\ncontroller workload could be made more flexible by\ndynamically modifying sector boundaries. Prior work\nhas developed methods for dynamically creating new\nsector boundaries [1-5].\nMany assessments of\ndynamic configuration methods assume the currentday baseline configuration remains fixed [6-7], even\nthough in actual operations it changes. To improve\nbenefit assessment accuracy, baseline simulations\nshould use multiple configurations triggered at\nrealistic reconfiguration times. However, the large\nnumber of daily operational reconfigurations creates\na complicated baseline for the current stage of\ndynamic airspace research. A challenging research\nquestion is how to select a representative, simplified\nset of configurations to assess potential benefits of\nproposed dynamic configuration concepts.\n\nBloem used operational sector reconfigurations\nas a baseline for evaluating benefits of combining\nand splitting sectors [8]. However, a difficulty with\nthis approach is that operational reconfiguration data\nis noisy. Reconfigurations often occur frequently to\naccommodate staff training or breaks, or to complete\na more complicated reconfiguration through a rapid\nsequence of simpler reconfigurations. Gupta\nquantified a few features of airspace boundary\nchanges from this data [9]. Most of the metrics being\nused in the above literature are unique to sector\ncombining operations and not applicable to more\nflexible dynamic configuration concepts. To better\nunderstand what sort of reconfigurations are\nacceptable or beneficial, configuration metrics more\nsuitable for flexible boundaries should be developed,\nand their distribution in current practice should be\ncomputed.\nThis paper applies new configuration change\nmetrics to operational data to establish current day\nthresholds for these metrics. A method is developed\nto select a simple sequence of configurations among\noperational configurations to serve as a dynamic\nconfiguration\nbaseline\nfor\nfuture\ndynamic\nconfiguration concept assessments. Configuration\nchange metrics are compared between the operational\nand simplified configuration sets to determine which\nmetrics are relevant to assess proposed dynamic\nconfiguration concepts.\nCurrent-day sector combining practices and the\noperational data analysis are presented in Section II.\nSection III describes the clustering algorithm. An\nanalysis of clustered vs. operational reconfiguration\nmetrics is discussed in Section IV. Finally,\nconclusions are presented in Section V.\n\nII. Operational Data Analysis\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s\noperational\ndynamic\nairspace\nconfigurations are accomplished by combining and\nsplitting sectors. In Bloem et al [8], feedback from\nsubject matter experts indicated that there are\nmultiple considerations when making decisions to\ncombine or split sectors such as sector workload and\n\nThe\nfollowing\nsubsections\nanalyze\nconfigurations, stored sector combinations, recorded\nin operational data for Kansas City Air Route Traffic\nControl Center (ZKC) on February 8, 2007.\n\n1. Reconfiguration Patterns\nThis subsection analyzes patterns within the\nreconfiguration schedule. This includes analysis of\nreconfiguration frequency and the relationship\nbetween number of sectors and traffic volume.\nA. Reconfiguration Frequency\nReconfiguration events occur frequently, with\nfew sectors affected in any one reconfiguration. For\nexample, there were 78 reconfiguration events\nbetween 74 unique configurations recorded in\noperational data for ZKC on the test day.\nOperational reconfigurations often occur\nfrequently to accommodate staff training or breaks,\nor to complete a more complicated reconfiguration\nthrough a rapid sequence of simpler reconfigurations.\nThe following assumptions are used to filter noisy\noperational data:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDo not consider any configuration lasting less\nthan two minutes, as it is considered an\nintermediate configuration.\nAfter performing the above step, when\nconsecutive reconfigurations are the same, retain\nonly the last reconfiguration.\n\nBy removing the noisy data described above, the\ntest data was reduced to 55 configuration events\nbetween 53 unique configurations. All remaining\nanalysis within this section used this filtered\nconfiguration schedule.\n\n60\n\nConfiguration Number\n\nstaff availability. Sectors are split to reduce the\nworkload in the resulting sectors, thereby increasing\nsafety. Sectors are combined when traffic volumes\nare low.\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0:00\n\n4:00\n\n8:00\n\n12:00 16:00\nTime (CST)\n\n20:00\n\n0:00\n\nFigure 1. Reconfiguration Schedule\nFigure 1 shows the filtered reconfiguration\nschedule throughout the day. The vertical green lines\nare reconfiguration trigger times. Most configurations\nwere unique; however, the same configuration may\nbe used more than once. For example, configuration\n25 was used in two periods on the test day: (a) from\n12:09 CST to 13:12 CST, and (b) from 14:56 CST to\n18:08 CST.\nFigure 1 also shows that the reconfiguration\ntrigger times are not uniformly distributed throughout\nthe day. There are four observed periods.\n1. Few\nreconfigurations\nhappened\nbetween\nnighttime (02:00 CST) and the morning (08:00\nCST).\n2. A series of reconfigurations happened rapidly\nfrom the morning (08:00 CST) to the afternoon\n(13:00 CST).\n3. Few reconfigurations happened from the\nafternoon (13:00 CST) to the evening (19:00\nCST).\n4. A series of reconfigurations happened gradually\nfrom the evening (19:00 CST) to nighttime\n(02:00 CST).\nAn area of specialization (AOS) is a group of\nsectors on which all controllers working those sectors\nmust be trained. Reconfiguration may occur only\nwithin an AOS, ensuring that an AOS controller will\nbe familiar with the resulting airspace. There are six\nAOSs, or Areas, in Kansas City Center, namely, Flint\nHills, Gateway, Ozark, Prairie, Rivers, and Trails.\nFigure 2 shows the reconfiguration schedule of\nindividual AOSs. The number of reconfigurations in\neach AOS is between 9 and 16 on that day.\nReconfigurations are less frequent within AOSs than\n\nwithin the Center as a whole because reconfiguration\nevents are not coordinated across AOSs.\n\n12\n10\n8\n\nFlint Hills\nGateway\nOzark\nPrairie\nRivers\nTrails\n\n2.

Traffic Volume and Sector Count\nAirspace configurations are directly related to\ntraffic volume and staff availability. The number of\nsectors is increased and decreased to accommodate\nthe fluctuating traffic load. Moreover, each controller\ncan handle only a certain number of aircraft at the\nsame time, and thus the overall traffic volume in a\ncenter depends on the number of staff available.\nFigure 3 shows aircraft and sector counts in\nKansas City Center on February 8, 2007. The number\nof sectors on that day was between 7 and 35. The\ncorrelation between aircraft count and sector count is\nover 0.95, indicating a strong relationship between\ntraffic volume and number of sectors, as expected.\nSector Count\n\nAircraft Count\n300\n\n30\n200\n\n20\n100\n\nAircraft Count\n\nNumber of Sectors\n\n40\n\n10\n\n0\n0:00\n\n0\n\n4:00\n\n8:00\n\n12:00 16:00 20:00\nTime (CST)\n\n0:00\n\nFigure 3.

The metrics\nanalyzed in this subsection were designed to quantify\nthese key characteristics. The hours of operation\nmetric was used to quantify familiarity and the sector\nchange metric was used to quantify continuity.\nA. Hours of Operation\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of operational\nsector hours on the test day. A total of 36 sectors\nwere defined in the operational data. These sectors\nwere active for some duration throughout the day.\nSeven sectors were active for the entire 24 hours, 9\n(25%) were operating for 16 to 18 hours, and 33\n(91.7%) were active for at least 10 hours. On\naverage, sectors were active for 15 hours and 33\nminutes.\n10\n\nNumber of Sectors\n\nConfiguration Number\n\n14\n\nreconfiguration frequency noted in the previous\nsubsection with periods of rapid increase or decrease\nin traffic volume corresponding to periods of high\nreconfiguration frequency.\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n16\nHours of Operation\n\n20\n\n24\n\nFigure 4. Sector Hours\nB. Sector Change\nFigure 5 depicts a breakdown of the numbers of\nsectors into two categories, sectors that changed and\nstayed the same, after each reconfiguration. A sector\nis changed when part of its associated airspace is\nreassigned during a reconfiguration. As illustrated in\nthe figure, most sectors remained the same, while few\nsectors change at each reconfiguration.\n\n35\n30\n25\n\nA. Aircraft Ownership Change\nFor simplicity, this study assumed a controller\nowned all aircraft that were in the sector. This\nassumes that aircraft were transferred at the sector\nboundary during stable configuration periods or when\nthe airspace they occupied transferred to another\nsector during a reconfiguration.\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0:00\n\n4:00\n\n8:00\n\n12:00 16:00\nTime (EST)\n\n20:00\n\n0:00\n\nFigure 5. Sectors Changed in Reconfiguration\nFigure 6 shows the histogram of the number of\nsectors changed in each reconfiguration on the test\nday. The majority (34 of 54, or 63%) of the\nreconfigurations involve two sectors changing. On\naverage, 2.8 sectors are changed at each\nreconfiguration event. The few sectors affected at\neach reconfiguration suggest that current operations\nprefer to incrementally combine or split sectors, and\nthus, sector configuration continuity is preserved.\n\nNumber of Reconfigurations\n\n35\n30\n25\n\nDuring a reconfiguration, sector controllers\nhandle aircraft from one of the three categories \xe2\x80\x93\naircraft remaining within their current sectors, aircraft\ntransferring from adjacent sectors, and aircraft\ntransferring to adjacent sectors. Hereafter, these are\nreferred to as remaining, inbound, and outbound\naircraft. A hand-off action is required for inbound\nand outbound aircraft, but not for remaining aircraft.\nFigure 7 shows the average number of aircraft\nownership changes per sector, which is defined by\ndividing the total number of aircraft ownership\nchanges by the number of sectors after a\nreconfiguration. The figure shows that in Kansas City\nCenter, on average, 1.8 aircraft were handed-off to a\nsector, as well as 1.8 from a sector. Five aircraft, on\naverage, remained in the same sector after a\nreconfiguration.\n\n20\n8\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n6\n8\nNumber of Sectors Changed\n\n10\n\nFigure 6. Histogram of Number of Sectors\nChanged in Reconfiguration\n\n3. Detailed Sector Change Metrics\nThe airspace change metrics in the previous\nsubsection counted total numbers of sectors that\nchanged. Metrics analyzed in this subsection quantify\nthe sector change in more detail. In addition to being\napplicable to sector combinations, these metrics may\nbe applied to the finer boundary adjustments\nproposed in future airspace concepts. Jung et al [10]\nidentified changes in aircraft ownership, sector\nvolume, and sector shape to be significant\n\nAverage Aircraft Count\n\nNumber of Sectors\n\ncontributors to increased controller workload during\nunplanned sector boundary changes.

Average Aircraft Ownership Change\nThe maximum number of remaining, inbound,\nand outbound aircraft ownership changes share\nsimilar trends as those shown in Figure 7. The largest\nmaximum aircraft ownership changes (no more than\n15 inbound and 10 outbound) are found in the early\nmorning and late evening hours. Maximum aircraft\nownership changes remained low (no more than 5\n\ninbound or outbound) between 12:00 CST and 19:00\nCST, the peak traffic volume period.\n\nSector Count\n40\n\n30\n\n10\n8\n\n20\n6\n4\n\nSector Count\n\nAirspace Volume\n\n12\nChange (x105 nmi3)\n\nB. Airspace Volume Change\nThe total airspace volume change metric\ncaptures the amount of change in sector volume\nduring a reconfiguration event. Assume there are w\nsectors changed after a reconfiguration. The total\nairspace volume change is the sum of the absolute\nchange in volume of all of the sectors,\n\nVolume Change\n14\n\n10\n\n2\n\nw\n\n# V (i,t) " V (i,t "1) ,\n\n0\n0:00\n\ni=1\n\nFigure 8 shows the total airspace volume change\nand sector count at each reconfiguration. A majority\n(35 of 54, or 64.8%) of the reconfigurations had total\nairspace volume change less than 3!105 nmi3. On\naverage, 2.9!105 nmi3 total airspace volume was\naffected after a reconfiguration.\nThe total airspace volume change has an inverse\n!\nrelationship to the number of sectors. The more\nsectors in the center, the less airspace volume\nchanged after a reconfiguration. This follows from\nthe fact that for a fixed airspace volume, increasing\nthe number of sectors decreases the volume of each\nsector. Therefore, when the number of sectors is high\nand a sector is combined with another one, or a sector\nis split, the affected airspace volume is limited.\nAdditionally,\ncurrent\npractice\nprefers\nincrementally combining and splitting sectors. A\nlarge sector during a low traffic period results from\nmerging small sectors progressively, and small\nsectors during a high traffic period result from\nsplitting sectors progressively.\n\n8:00 12:00 16:00 20:00 0:00\nTime (CST)\n\nFigure 8. Total Airspace Volume Change and\nNumber of Sectors\nFigure 9 shows the cumulative frequency of\naverage airspace volume change per sector as a\npercentage. The average percentage change is defined\nas\nw\n\n1 $i=1 V (i,t) # V (i,t #1)\n"\n"100% ,\nw\nw\n$ V (i,t #1)\ni=1\n\nwhere V(i, t) is the volume of sector i at time t.\nThe figure shows that the 25th percentile of the\nreconfigurations had 26.5% average airspace volume\nchange. The median of the average airspace volume\nchange was 38%. The 75th percentile of the\nreconfigurations had 48.9% average airspace volume\nchange.\n100\n\nCumulative Frequency (%)\n\n!\n\nwhere V(i, t) is the volume of sector i at time t. If a\nnew sector is created after a reconfiguration, its\nvolume is considered zero before the reconfiguration.\nSimilarly, when an existing sector is deleted after a\nreconfiguration, its volume is considered zero after\nthe reconfiguration.\n\n0\n4:00\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nAverage Airspace Volume Change (%)\n\nFigure 9.

Hausdorff Distance Metric\nThe last metric being analyzed is the Hausdorff\ndistance metric [11]. The Hausdorff distance\nmeasures how much similarity two shapes have,\nconsidering that each shape can be described by a set\nof vertex points. Because the Hausdorff distance\nbetween two identical point sets is zero, two identical\nconfigurations will always have zero metric value.\nLess similar sectorization pairs have larger metric\nvalue.\nFigure 11 shows the Hausdorff distance metric\nbetween\nconfigurations\nbefore\nand\nafter\nreconfiguration trigger times. The majority (30 of 54,\nor 55.6%) of the reconfigurations had metric values\nbetween 100 and 200 nmi. On average, the metric\nvalue was 156.9 nmi.\nTable 1 lists the average and maximum\nmeasurements, in nautical miles, of changed sectors\nbefore reconfigurations. This indicates that the\nmajority of the reconfigurations had Hausdorff\ndistance metric values between the average width and\nthe average length of changed sectors.\n\nTable 1.

Clustering Configurations\nFuture airspace reconfiguration concepts should\nbe evaluated against a current-day baseline to assess\npotential benefits. Many assessments assume the\ncurrent-day baseline configuration remains fixed,\neven though in practice, it changes. By providing a\nrepresentative, simplified set of configurations and\nallowing multiple configurations to be triggered\nduring a baseline simulation, there is the potential to\nimprove benefit assessment accuracy for new\nconcepts.\nIn this section, a method is proposed using kmeans clustering to select a sequence of\nconfigurations and trigger times from operational\nsector combination data. The selection process\nconsiders controller familiarity and sector continuity.\nK-means is a process for partitioning multidimensional observations into k sets such that each\nobservation is closest to its assigned cluster [12]. The\nprocess has four steps:\n(1) Guess initial means of the clusters,\n(2) Calculate distance score between\nobservation and the means of the clusters,\n\neach\n\n(3) Assign each observation to the cluster with the\nnearest mean based on the distance score, and\n\n(4) Recalculate the means of individual clusters\nbased on the assignments in (3).\nAfter performing step (4), the process repeats\nuntil all the recalculated means of the clusters remain\nunchanged.\nConfigurations are stored assignments of\ndifferent Fix Posting Areas (FPAs) to sectors. An\nFPA is a region containing at least one fix, a threedimensional location for guidance. For a single\nconfiguration, each FPA may be assigned to only one\nsector. In operational data, each FPA is a right prism,\nin which vertical rectangular sides connect the top\nand bottom polygons. This is described by twodimensional coordinates of vertices of the base\npolygon, and a pair of minimum and maximum\naltitudes.\nGiven a sequence of configurations in a center,\nthe goal is to cluster all configurations into k clusters\nsuch that the sectors have the most stability with\nrespect to duration of combination.\nA matrix representation to detect FPA-pairwise\ncombinations in a single configuration is presented in\nSubsection 1. Subsection 2 presents a matrix\nrepresentation that describes FPA-pairwise stability\nin a sequence of configurations. Subsection 3\nexplains how to guess initial means of the clusters.\nSimilarity scores between each observation and the\nmeans of the clusters are explained in Subsection 4.\nCluster assignment and the final configuration\nselection process are detailed in Subsection 5.\nFinally, Subsection 6 presents the clustering results.\n\n1. FPA-Pairwise Combination\nIn a given configuration, two distinct FPAs are\npairwise combined when they are assigned to the\nsame sector. It is not necessary that the two FPAs are\n!\nadjacent. For example, when three FPAs are\ncombined from left to right horizontally, the leftmost\nand rightmost FPAs are considered pairwise\ncombined.\nAssume a total of n FPAs are available for the\nsector assignment in a configuration. An FPApairwise combination matrix F, an n-by-n binary\nsquare matrix, is constructed such that\n\n#1 if FPAs i and j (i " j) are combined,\nFi, j = $\n%0 otherwise,\n\n!\n\nwhere subscripts i and j denote the i-th row and j-th\ncolumn, respectively, of the matrix. The matrix F has\ntwo properties:\ni.\n\nIts elements on the main diagonal are zeros, as an\nFPA may not combine with itself. It follows that\nF1,1=F2,2=\xe2\x80\xa6=Fn,n=0.\n\nii. It is symmetric. That means F equals its\ntranspose (F=FT). When FPAs i and j are\ncombined, so are the FPAs j and i; when FPAs i\nand j are not combined, neither are the FPAs j\nand i. Thus, Fi,j=Fj,i.\n\n2. FPA-Pairwise Stability\nOperational sector combination data consists of\na sequence of triggered configurations of varying\nduration. Configuration duration relates directly to\ncontroller familiarity with sector combinations. The\nlonger the configuration duration, the greater\nfamiliarity a controller has with it. The duration of a\nconfiguration can be calculated by subtracting the\ntrigger time of the configuration from the trigger time\nof the next configuration.\nThe stability of a pair of FPAs relates directly to\nits combination duration. To measure stability of a\npair of FPAs in the sequence of configurations, an\nFPA-pairwise stability matrix M, an n-by-n square\nmatrix, is defined such that the (i, j)-th element is a\ntime-weighted sum of all (i, j)-th elements of\nindividual FPA-pairwise combination matrices. Thus,\n\nM i, j\n\n#\n=\n\nm\n\nt " [Fc ] i, j\n\nc=1 c\nm\n\n#\n\nc=1\n\n,\n\ntc\n\nwhere subscript c represents the m configurations in\nthe sequence, tc is the duration of configuration c, and\nFc is the FPA-pairwise combination matrix for\nconfiguration c. The time-weighted function scales\nthe total duration of an FPA-pairwise combination in\nthe sequence of configurations to a value between\nzero and one. A value of zero in M indicates that the\ntwo corresponding FPAs are never combined among\nall the configurations. A value of one in M indicates\nthat the two FPAs are always combined. Note that the\nmatrix M has the same properties mentioned above\nfor F: all its elements on the main diagonal are zeros,\nand it is symmetric.\nElements in the FPA-pairwise stability matrix\ndetermine the fraction of time that two FPAs are\n\ncombined in a sequence of configurations. For\nexample, an (i, j)-th element with a value of 0.8\nmeans the FPAs at the i-th row and j-th column are\ncombined 80% of the time in the sequence of\nconfigurations. This matrix can be used to represent\nthe controller familiarity with sector combinations.\n\n3. Initial Means of Clusters\nA cluster contains a sequence of configurations,\nand its mean can be determined by selecting a\nconfiguration that has the most FPA-pairwise\n!\nstability. The stability is computed as follows:\n(1) For each configuration c in the sequence,\nconstruct the FPA-pairwise combination matrix,\nF c.\n(2) Given a sequence of configurations, construct the\nFPA-pairwise stability matrix, M, which defines\nthe time-weighted stability among all the\npairwise FPAs.\n\nconfiguration and the means of the clusters. Let r and\nc be the mean of a cluster and a configuration in the\ncluster, respectively. The similarity score between r\nand c is defined as\nn\n\nn\n\ndist(r,c) = # # [M r " Fc ] i, j ,\ni=1 j=1\n\nwhere Mr is the FPA-pairwise stability matrix of the\nconfigurations in the cluster, and Fc is the FPApairwise combination matrix for configuration c.\nConfiguration c will be assigned to the cluster that\nhas the minimum similarity score.\nThe above similarity score is a distance metric\nbetween a mean of the cluster and a configuration.\nThe distance metric measures the similarity and\nstability. The lower the score, the more similarity the\ntwo configurations have.\n\n5. Configuration Selection\n\n(3) Compute the matrix difference between Fc and\nM. The difference score is obtained by summing\nabsolute values of all the elements in the\ndifference matrix. The absolute values are used\nbecause stability comparison is considered a\nsymmetric operation, which means two\nconfigurations have the same level of stability\nregardless of their comparison order.\n\nGiven a sequence of configurations, the\nobjective is to produce k clusters and a representative\nconfiguration for each cluster such that the total\nsimilarity score between this configuration and the\nothers is minimal. The combination of the FPAs in\nthe representative configuration will have both\nstability and similarity to the other configurations in\nthe same cluster.\n\n(4) Select the configuration that has the least\ndifference score.\n\nMathematically, for m configurations, the kmeans algorithm divides them into k clusters (k < m)\nsuch that the sum of the clusters\xe2\x80\x99 similarity scores is\nminimal, thus,\n\nStep (4) repeats until k configurations are\nselected. Thus, the initial cluster means are the\nconfigurations that minimize the scoring function\nn\n\nn\n\n# # [F\n\nc\n\n" M] i, j ,\n\ni=1 j=1\n\n!\n\nwhere subscript c represents the sequence of\n!\nconfigurations. Recall that the elements of Fc are\neither zero or one, and the elements of M are between\nzero and one. Therefore, the mean of the cluster is\nselected based on the FPA-pairwise duration.\n\n4. Similarity Score\nAfter defining the initial means of the clusters,\nthe next step is to calculate a similarity score between\neach configuration and the means of the clusters. The\nscoring function in the previous subsection is applied\nto compute the similarity score between a\n\nk\n\narg min #\nS\n\n# dist(r ,c )\nx\n\ny\n\nx=1 c y "S x\n\nwhere \xe2\x80\x9carg min\xe2\x80\x9d stands for the argument of the\nminimum operator, S is the set of k clusters, rx is the\nrepresentative configurations in Sx, cy is the\nconfiguration in Sx, and dist(rx, cy) is a function of\nsimilarity score between two specified configurations\nrx and cy. When the k-means algorithm halts, the\nmeans of the clusters indicate the most similar and\nstable configuration among other configurations in\nthe same cluster. Thus, the means are the\nrepresentative configurations in the dynamic\nconfiguration baseline. The cluster boundaries define\nthe trigger times for configuration change.\n\n6. Clustering Results\nThe k-means algorithm is applied to both the\nraw and processed data sets of operational sector\ncombinations in Kansas City Center on February 8,\n2007. The raw set contains all the 78 operational\nconfigurations; the processed set contains the 55\noperational configurations without noise. Figure 12\nshows the total similarity scores for k equals one\nthrough seven applied to the 55 operational\nconfigurations. The score improves (decreases)\nrapidly until the three-configuration schedule. For\nthis day, the three-configuration schedule yields the\nbest accuracy for the increased scenario complexity.\nThis is consistent with Chatterji\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that two\nto three sector configurations are adequate for a good\nweather day from safety and resource utilization\nperspectives [13].\n\nTotal Similarity Score\n\n250\n\nConfiguration Number\n\n60\n50\n\nConfiguration\nRepresentative\nTrigger Time\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0:00\n\n4:00\n\n8:00\n\n12:00 16:00\nTime (CST)\n\n20:00\n\n0:00\n\nFigure 13.

Total Similarity Scores\nThe three-configuration clustering results\n(selected configurations and reconfiguration trigger\ntimes) were identical between raw and processed data\nsets. The clustering results indicate that by using the\nsimilarity score, the algorithm is capable of filtering\nout operational noise.\n\nIn this section, the metrics used to analyze the\noperational data are modified to analyze the threeconfiguration cluster result presented in the previous\nsection. Metrics that are directly related to frequency\nor expressed as a total or sum per reconfiguration\nwould be significantly affected by representing\nmultiple instances with a single reconfiguration.\nInstead, metrics were modified to be sector-centric\nrather than reconfiguration-centric so that metrics\ncould be expressed as averages per sector for each\nreconfiguration.\n\n1. Reconfiguration Patterns\nA. Reconfiguration Frequency\nThe three representative reconfigurations had\nonly two reconfiguration trigger times indicated by\nthe vertical dashed purple lines in Figure 13. The first\nreconfiguration event occurred in the morning (8:19\nCST), at the beginning of a rapid series of operational\nsector splitting. The second reconfiguration event\noccurred in the evening (20:58 CST), about two\nhours after a gradual series of operational sector\ncombining. The two trigger times divided the day\ninto two periods, daytime and nighttime. One\nconfiguration was assigned to the daytime, while two\nconfigurations were assigned to the nighttime.\n\nActual\n\nClustered\n\n200\n20\n100\n10\n\n0\n4:00\n\n8:00\n\n16\n12\n8\n4\n0\n0\n\n12:00 16:00 20:00\nTime (CST)\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n16\nHours of Operation\n\n20\n\n24\n\nFigure 15.

Traffic Volume and Sector Count\nFigure 14 shows the numbers of sectors in the\nactual and clustered reconfigurations, as well as the\naircraft count in Kansas City Center. The numbers of\nsectors\namong\nthe\nthree\nrepresentative\nreconfigurations are 7, 34, and 26, respectively. The\ncorrelation between traffic volume and the number of\nsectors in the clustered reconfigurations is over 0.86.\nThe high correlation indicates that the sector count\ncorrelates with the trend of the traffic volume almost\nas well as the operational reconfigurations.\n\n0:00\n\nFigure 14. Number of Sectors and Aircraft Count\n\n2. Familiarity and Continuity\nA. Hours of Operation\nThe durations of the three representative\nreconfigurations are approximately 7, 13, and 4\nhours. Figure 15 shows the distribution of sector\nhours of operation based on the actual and clustered\nreconfigurations.\nOf the 36 sectors defined in the operational data,\nthe same seven sectors were active for the entire 24\nhours in both data sets. Two sectors having less than\nfour sector hours in the actual operation were inactive\nin the clustered data.\nOf the 34 sectors in the clustered data, all were\noperating for over 12 hours and the majority (19, or\n55.9%) of them were operating for 16 to 18 hours.\nOn average, the sectors were active for 17 hours and\n43 minutes. This is roughly two hours longer than the\nactual operational average.\n\nB. Sector Change\nTable 2 lists the number of sector changes based\non the actual and clustered reconfigurations. The\naverage and cumulative number of sector changes in\nthe actual operation is calculated between two\nadjacent cluster means in the clustered operation. The\ncumulative number of sector changes in the actual\noperation was 74+36=110, while the number of\nsector changes in the clustered operation was\n34+23=57, about half of the cumulative number of\nsector changes in actual operation. The number of\nsector changes in the clustered operation was about\nten times the average number of sector changes in\nactual operation. This comparison indicates that the\nnumber of sector changes is not a good metric to\naccess new dynamic airspace designs using a\nsimplified reconfiguration.\nTable 2.

Aircraft Ownership Change\nFigure 16 shows the average numbers (dark\ncolors) and maximum numbers (light colors) of\nremaining, inbound, and outbound aircraft in Kansas\nCity Center at the two clustered trigger times, 8:19\nCST and 20:58 CST on February 8, 2007. The\nnumbers of ownership change in the actual operation\nwere computed based on data between two adjacent\ncluster means in the clustered operation.\n\nIn the actual operation between two adjacent\ncluster means, on average, most (54.4% and 64.6%)\nof the aircraft remained in the same sector after\nreconfiguration. In addition, the number of inbound\naircraft matched the number of outbound aircraft.\nMore aircraft remained in the same sector, while the\nhand-off actions were distributed equally among the\ninbound and outbound aircraft.\nOn the other hand, in the clustered operation, the\naverage number of outbound aircraft was about triple\nof that of remaining and inbound aircraft during the\nfirst reconfiguration at 8:19 CST, while the numbers\nof remaining, inbound, and outbound aircraft were\ndistributed fairly evenly during the second\nreconfiguration at 20:58 CST.\nRegarding the maximum aircraft ownership\nchange, most aircraft remained in the same sector\nafter reconfiguration in the actual operation, while\nmost aircraft were transferring to adjacent sectors in\nthe clustered operation.\nMaximum:\nAverage:\n\nRemaining\nRemaining\n\nInbound\nInbound\n\nOutbound\nOutbound\n\n16\n\nThis comparison indicates that the aircraft\nownership change is not a good metric to access new\ndynamic airspace designs using a simplified\nreconfiguration.\nTable 3.

Aircraft Ownership Change\nB. Airspace Volume Change\nTable 3 lists total airspace volume change based\non actual and clustered operations. During the first\nreconfiguration at 8:19 CST, the airspace volume\nchange in the clustered operation was about half of\nthe cumulative total airspace volume change in the\nactual operation between the first and second cluster\nmeans.\nDuring the second reconfiguration at 20:58 CST,\nthe airspace volume change in the clustered operation\nmatched the cumulative total airspace volume change\nin the actual operation between the second and third\ncluster means.\n\n0\nActual\n\nClustered\n8:19\n\nActual\n\nClustered\n20:58\n\nFigure 17. Aircraft Density Change\nC. Hausdorff Distance Metric\nTable 4 lists the Hausdorff distance metric\nvalues based on the actual and clustered operational\ndata. When reconfiguration occurred progressively in\nthe actual operation, the average metric values were\n154.3 nmi and 128 nmi at the two trigger times\nrespectively. However, in the clustered operation, the\nmetric values increased to 4,328.55 nmi and 994.73\nnmi respectively.\n\nThe large difference of the Hausdorff distance\nmetric values is due to progressively evolved\nsectorizations in the actual operation. Actual\nreconfiguration events changed few pairs of sectors,\nand thus, many sectors remained the same. Recall\nthat the metric is a sum of Hausdorff distances of\nsectors between two sectorizations, since the\nHausdorff distance of unchanged sectors is zero, the\nmetric value is relatively small for progressively\nevolved sectors. On the other hand, when sectors are\ncompletely changed from one sectorization to another\nsectorization, as in the clustered operation, the metric\nvalue becomes large because the Hausdorff distance\nof changed sectors is great than zero.\nTable 4.

On the\nother hand, the metric value during the second\nreconfiguration in the clustered operation was about\n61% of the cumulative metric value between the\nsecond and third means of the clusters in the actual\noperation.\n\nV. Conclusions\nData from 78 sector configurations recorded\nfrom Kansas City Air Route Traffic Control Center\noperational data on February 8, 2007 were analyzed\nusing seven metrics in three categories: (1) pattern\nwithin reconfiguration schedule, (2) metrics specific\nto controller familiarity and sector combination\ncontinuity, and (3) detailed sector change metrics.\nOperational reconfigurations happened rapidly\nin the morning and happened gradually in the\nevening. Current practice prefers incrementally\ncombining and splitting sectors, and there were 9 to\n16 reconfigurations in each of six areas of\nspecialization. Center-wide reconfigurations were\nuncoordinated. There is a strong relationship between\ntraffic volume and number of sectors. On average,\nsectors were active for 15 hours and 33 minutes and\n2.8 sectors were changed at each reconfiguration\n\nevent. During reconfiguration, the number of aircraft\ntransferred from adjacent sectors matched the number\nof aircraft transferred to adjacent sectors. On average,\nafter a reconfiguration about five aircraft remained in\nthe same sector, and two aircraft were handed-off to a\nsector, and two were received from a sector.\nA method using k-means clustering was\nproposed to select a simplified sequence of\nconfigurations and trigger times from operational\nsector combination data. The selection process\nconsidered the two key characteristics of sector\ncombining and splitting operations: controller\nfamiliarity with sector combination and continuity in\nsector combination. Based on the similarity score, the\nmethod selected three representative configurations.\nThe clustered configurations were compared with the\nactual operational configurations. On average,\nclustered sectors were active for about two hours\nlonger than actual operations. There were significant\ndifferences in most detailed sector change metrics\nbetween actual and clustered operations. However,\nthe average remaining, inbound, and outbound\naircraft density change from the actual operation\nmatched that of the clustered operation. Therefore, of\nthe sector change metrics presented in this paper,\naircraft density change is the best sector change\nmetric to assess new dynamic airspace designs using\na simplified reconfiguration schedule.\n\nReferences\n[1] Hoffman, R., A.
