Special emphasis was placed on the developing country market, but the developed countries and the communist group were also included in the forecasts. Aircraft needs were projected to the year 2000 by a method which accounted for field size, crop production, treated area, productivity, and attrition of the fleet. A special scenario involving a significant shift toward aerial fertilization was also considered. An operations analysis was conducted to compare the relative application costs of various existing and hypothetical future aircraft. A case study was made of Colombia as an example of a developing country in which aviation is emerging as an important industry.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790012829, "id": "d28953ffce954572adf300531bc30927", "publicationDate": "1979-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790012829.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790012829/downloads/19790012829.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790012829/downloads/19790012829.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790012829/downloads/19790012829.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
