Each module was comprised of four separate submodules which were parallel connected. The submodules contained 45 EFG cells which were series interconnected by a shingle or overlapping design. The inherent rectangular shape of the cells allowed a high packing factor to be achieved. The average efficiency of the six modules, corrected to AM1 at 28 C was 8.7%, which indicates that the average encapsulated cell efficiency was 10.0%.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790006379, "id": "328fc6202cef4f28b35f3f63ff0faeec", "publicationDate": "1978-09-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790006379.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790006379/downloads/19790006379.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790006379/downloads/19790006379.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790006379/downloads/19790006379.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
