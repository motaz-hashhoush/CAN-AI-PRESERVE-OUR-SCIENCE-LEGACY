Some of these stones were collected at\nSutter\xe2\x80\x99s Mill, in the historic site where the California\ngold rush was initiated, giving the name to this meteorite. Thus far, 77 pieces of the meteorite have been\ncollected, for a total mass of 943 g, with the biggest\nstone weighing 205 g [1].\nSample selection:\nThis work presents a\npreliminary Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)\nspectroscopy study of small fragments from two stones\nof the Sutter\xe2\x80\x99s Mill meteorite, SM2 (4.0 g, collected\nApril 24th at coordinates 38.8029\xc2\xb0N, 120.9086\xc2\xb0W by\nP. Jenniskens) and SM12 (17.5 g, collected April 27th\nat coordinates 38.7857\xc2\xb0N, 120.9091\xc2\xb0W by M.\nWaiblinger) [1]. We had only a small amount of SM2\nand much of this material subsequently proved to\ncontain fusion crust. For SM12, we had enough\nmaterial to select among available fragments (both\nwith naked eyes and under a microscope) and obtain\nsamples of both fusion crust and non-fusion crust\nmaterials.\nMethods and analysis:\nInfrared spectra of\nfragments from these Sutter\xe2\x80\x99s Mill meteoritic samples\nwere recorded with a Nicolet iN10 MX FTIR\nmicroscope in the mid-infrared range (2.5\xe2\x80\x9314.8 \xc2\xb5m,\n4000\xe2\x80\x93675 cm-1). This microscope is capable of\nanalyzing small samples of down to 10 \xc2\xb5m in size, and\nis equipped with a liquid N2-cooled MCT detector,\nproviding a 4 cm-1 resolution. All samples (inner\nmaterial of the meteorite or fusion crust) were\ndeposited on a clean glass slide, crushed with a\nstainless steel roller tool, and placed directly on the\nfocal plane of the microscope. IR spectra were\ncollected with the OMNIC software in the reflection\nmode by averaging 128 scans. Finally, for one\nfragment of stone SM12, an entire 150-\xc2\xb5m size\nparticle was mapped as a mosaic of overlapping 20-\xc2\xb5m\nsize windows with a spectral resolution of 4 cm-1.\nResults: Preliminary IR spectra of fragments of\nboth stones SM2 and SM12 (non-fusion crust material)\nshow that the mineral composition of those particles is\neither dominated by silicates or carbonates, or consists\nof a mixture of both [2,3].\nThe silicates are\ncharacterized by an fairly symmetric feature centered\nnear 1000 cm-1 that is characteristic of phyllosilicates.\n\nThe carbonates display a number of bands, the\nstrongest of which is a broad, intense absorption\nfeature centered near 1450 cm-1. The exact nature of\nthe silicates and carbonates present in this particular\nstone has yet to be identified, although further analysis\nmay provide information about their elemental\ncompositions.\nFigure 1 shows a representative IR spectrum of the\ninner material of a particle chosen from SM2, in which\nmost of the features are associated with carbonates\n(2515 cm-1, 1797 cm-1, a broad band centered at 1433\ncm-1, 882 cm-1, and 715 cm-1). Features associated\nwith phyllosilicates include a symmetric Si-O\nstretching mode band centered at 1011 cm-1 and\nseveral O-H stretching mode bands. The O-H shows\nup in two forms - a broadband centered at 3415 cm-1\nthat is probably largely due to adsorbed H2O and a\nmuch weaker, narrower feature centered near 3680 cm1\ndue to structural -OH. SM2 was collected before it\nrained in the collection area, so its H2O is original\nand/or due to atmospheric absorption (note that SM12\nwas exposed to rain, so its H2O component must be at\nleast partially terrestrial). Additional features observed\nin the 2985\xe2\x80\x932855 cm-1 range are due to the symmetric\nand asymmetric stretching modes of aliphatic -CH3 and\n-CH2- groups, suggesting the presence of organics.\nThe relative intensities of these bands are somewhat\nunusual. Typically, the asymmetric aliphatic C-H\nstretching bands are stronger than the symmetric\n\nFigure 1. IR spectrum of a representative fragment of\nSM2 showing absorption features associated with\ncarbonates and phyllosilicates.\n\nstretching bands, but in this case the reverse is true (the\nblended symmetric modes near 2860 cm-1 are stronger\nthan the asymmetric bands near 2970 and 2925 cm-1).\nIt is interesting to note that this unusual pattern is well\nmatched by the aliphatic features seen in the spectrum\nof a terrestrial calcite (CaCO3) standard. Both this\nobservation, and the fact that the strength of the\ncarbonate and aliphatic organic bands seem to correlate\nbetween different spectra, suggest the organics are\nsomehow associated with the carbonates.\nSamples of the fusion crust of both stones SM2 and\nSM12 display much simpler spectra that are dominated\nby a strong silicate feature around 1000 cm-1, much\nweaker features associated with water, and no bands\nassociated with organics, as expected for a heated\nmaterial (Fig. 2).\n\nFigure 2. IR spectrum of a sample of the fusion crust\nof stone SM12, showing a much simpler spectrum than\nthe inner material of the meteorite.\nAs a cautionary point, we note that the spectrum of\none particle from SM2 showed a complex IR spectrum\nindicative of organics, but one very different from\nnormal meteoritic organics or meteoritic IOM. Since\nSM2 was found in a parking lot where it had been\nbroken into bits after being run over by a car, and since\nmost of the SM2 particles we received were dominated\nby fusion crust, we suspect this organic material is\nfrom a car tire. Not having a sample of the relevant car\ntire, however, this is currently only a supposition.\nIR spectra of samples from stone SM12 show\nstrong similarities with samples from SM2, with bands\nassociated with carbonates, phyllosilicates, and both\nadsorbed H2O and structural -OH. Since SM12 was\nexposed to rain, its H2O is likely to be at least partially\nof terrestrial origin. Also, similarly to SM2, some\nparticles are clearly dominated by silicates, while\nothers are clearly dominated by carbonates.\n\nFigure 3. Average IR spectra obtained by combining\nthe 182 individual mosaic spectra of a ~150 \xc2\xb5m grain\nfrom SM12 that largely consists of carbonates.\nOne of the particles dominated by carbonates from\nstone SM12 was analyzed by collecting a mosaic of\n182 spectra covering the area of the whole particle.\nThese spectra do show some variation from one spot to\nanother, but they are mostly dominated by strong\ncarbonate features near 2515, 1796, ~1455, 879, and\n711 cm-1. They also all display an absorbed H2O band\nnear 3420 cm-1, a weak structural \xe2\x80\x93OH band near 3680\ncm-1, and a weak band near 990 cm-1 that could be due\nto phyllosilicates. Features in this particle that are\nassociated with potential phyllosilicates vary in\nintensity from spectrum to spectrum relative to the\ncarbonate bands, but are always significantly weaker\nthan what is observed in SM2 (Fig. 1). Figure 3 shows\nthe spectrum obtained from averaging all the spectra in\nthe mosaic of this particle and clearly confirms that its\ncomposition is dominated by carbonates.\nConclusions: IR spectra of both SM2 and SM12\nstones from the Sutter\xe2\x80\x99s Mill meteorite show a number\nof absorption features associated with the presence of\ncarbonates, phyllosilicates, and organics. Though the\ncomposition of different particles vary even within a\ngiven stone, the composition of our samples of SM2\nand SM12 are clearly dominated by carbonates,\npossibly calcite, with a significant contribution of\nphyllosilicates. Both the unusual band profile of the\naliphatic C-H stretching mode bands and their general\ncorrelation with the strength of the carbonate bands\nsuggests the organics and the carbonates are associated\nin some manner.\nReferences:\n[1] Jenniskens, P. et al.
