One of the ideas being explored is to\nproduce aviation fuels from carbon monoxide given off by\nindustrial waste gases that would otherwise add to\natmospheric pollution. Another idea is to explore the\nconversion from cellulosic and conventional plant sugars to\nfuels. Others involve the development of catalysts to convert\ndifferent carbon sources into fuels in small-scale reactors to\nserve as distributed fuel production sources. Currently, the\nbiofuels used by the U.S. Navy cost about $26/gal ($6.87/L)\n(Ref. 2). The money that the FAA is funneling into these\nprojects could boost the production of cost-effective fuels\nfrom biomass and waste feedstocks to enable the affordability\nfor commercial and military aviation fueling. Yet to date, the\nalternate fuels industry competitive costs and productivity\nhave not responded to feedstock restraints, incentives,\nsubsides, or mandates, and compliance taxes are passed to\nconsumers (Ref. 3).\n\nSummary\nIn order to realize alternative fueling for military and\ncommercial use, the industry has set forth guidelines that must\nbe met by each fuel. These aviation fueling requirements are\noutlined in MIL\xe2\x80\x93DTL\xe2\x80\x9383133F(2008) or ASTM D 7566\nAnnex (2011) standards, and are classified as \xe2\x80\x9cdrop-in\xe2\x80\x9d fuel\nreplacements. This report provides combustor performance\ndata for synthetic-paraffinic-kerosene- (SPK-) type (FischerTropsch (FT)) fuel and blends with JP\xe2\x80\x938+100, relative to JP\xe2\x80\x93\n8+100 as baseline fueling. Data were taken at various nominal\ninlet conditions: 75 psia (0.52 MPa) at 500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K),\n125 psia (0.86 MPa) at 625 \xef\x82\xb0F (603 K), 175 psia (1.21 MPa) at\n725 \xef\x82\xb0F (658 K), and 225 psia (1.55 MPa) at 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K).\nCombustor performance analysis assessments were made for\nthe change in flame temperatures, combustor efficiency, wall\ntemperatures, and exhaust plane temperatures at 3, 4, and\n5 percent combustor pressure drop (\xef\x81\x84P) for fuel:air ratios\n(F/As) ranging from 0.010 to 0.025. Significant general trends\nshow lower liner temperatures and higher flame and\ncombustor outlet temperatures with increases in FT fueling\nrelative to JP\xe2\x80\x938+100 fueling. The latter affects both turbine\nefficiency and blade and vane lives.\n\nIntroduction\nFinding an alternative fuel for aviation application requires\na fuel feedstock with sustainable supply at a low cost with low\nor no negative environmental impact. The requirements for\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217735\n\n1\n\nAdopting alternate fuels and fuel blends requires the use of\nfuel-flexible systems (combustors and engines) without\nsacrificing performance requirements. For military aviation,\nan alternative for traditional fuel for gas turbine and diesel\nsystems is required. However, in many proposed alternates,\nthe lack of sufficient amounts of aromatics that swell some\nfuel system seals and sulfur, which provides fuel injection\npump lubricity, have the potential to reduce design component\nuseful life (Ref. 4). For these fuels, additives are needed to\nincrease useful component life while maintaining the\nperformance. It is thought that Fischer-Tropsch- (FT)-type\nfuels can support gas turbine engines at similar levels as well\nas have potential use for diesel systems.\nThis report provides preliminary combustor performance\ndata for SPK-type FT fuel and blends relative to pure JP\xe2\x80\x93\n8+100 (herein referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cJP\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x9d), the currently used\naviation fuel. Data for \xe2\x80\x9cCombustor A,\xe2\x80\x9d a three-cup sector\nrepresentative of current engine combustor technology (see\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) images, Ref. 6,\nproprietary details withheld), were taken at 0, 50, and\n100 percent FT fueling (denoted as JP\xe2\x80\x938, 50:50, and FT,\nrespectively) with varied parameters of fuel:air ratio (F/A),\npercent combustor pressure drop (%\xce\x94P), and absolute\npressure. The data collected show that higher combustor\noperating temperatures have the potential to enhance system\nefficiency, but also take a toll on component life, as they have\na greater impact on the oxidation and failure of the materials\nwithin the combustor and turbine. A small temperature\ndifference of combustor gas entering the turbine can both be\ncritical to turbine life and affect efficiency; there is a need for\na good balance. \xe2\x80\x9cBleed air,\xe2\x80\x9d used to cool the combustor, case,\nturbine blades, vanes, and nozzles, could be increased to\ncompensate for the enhanced turbine inlet temperature; this\nparasitic air decreases the system efficiency but helps to\nmaintain a reasonable turbine life.\nFuel specifications; the test facility conditions, operations,\nschematic, and fueling system; estimates of measurement\nerrors; and combustor thermal data and postprocessing\nparameters of Combustor A are given in the Shouse et al.\npaper presented at ISROMAC 13 (Ref. 5). The CFD analysis\nand figures of combustor geometry and flow are in the Ryder\net al. paper (Ref. 6), also presented there. Compositional\nexamination of the synthetic-paraffinic kerosene with the\ncompositional-explicit distillation curve method is discussed in\nthe Bruno and Bailbourine article (Ref. 7), who makes a useful\ncomparison for heats of combustion based on molecular weight,\nvolume, and mass.\n\n(1.55-MPa) inlet condition, for three fueling compositions and\nthree F/A values at 3 percent \xce\x94P, and this report continues to\nanalyze all four inlet combustor conditions at all three\ncombustor \xce\x94P values tested for the FT fuel blends of 0, 50,\nand 100 percent with JP\xe2\x80\x938 fueling. Data were taken at various\nnominal inlet conditions as follows:\n(1) FT fuel composition: 0, 50 (\xc2\xb15 percent), and 100 percent\n(2) Pressure (P) and temperature (T):\n\xef\x82\xb7 75 psia (0.52 MPa) and 500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K)\n\xef\x82\xb7 125 psia (0.86 MPa) and 625 \xef\x82\xb0F (603 K)\n\xef\x82\xb7 175 psia (1.21 MPa) and 725 \xef\x82\xb0F (658 K)\n\xef\x82\xb7 225 psia (1.55 MPa) and 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K)\n(3) Combustor pressure drop (\xce\x94P): 3, 4, and 5 percent\n(4) F/A: 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, and 0.025\nCombustor performance analysis assessments were made\nfor the change in flame temperatures (Tflame), combustor\nefficiency, wall temperatures, and exhaust plane temperatures\n(Tplane).\nThe combustion efficiencies do not provide enough insight\nfor determining significant combustor changes, yet they do\nshow a trend to decrease with increased %\xce\x94P; thus, other\naforementioned (Tflame and Tplane) parameters will also be\ninvestigated. At 75 psia (0.52 MPa) the combustion efficiency\nof all fuel blends are outlined in Table I (Ref. 5).\n\nSurface Thermal Measurements\nThermocouples and pressure taps were placed throughout\nthe combustion chamber to record temperature and pressure.\nThe details of pressure drop measurements will not be\npresented in this paper, but it should be noted that no\ninconsistent pressure measurements were found. The\nconvection-cooled liner and wall surface temperature\nmeasurements are noted as either \xe2\x80\x9csidewall\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cliner\xe2\x80\x9d (which\nhas inside and outside faces).\n\nCombustor Thermal Performance\nThe proprietary-geometry combustor, Combustor A, used\nfor data collection represents a three-cup sector of a current\nengine combustor technology. Figure 1 shows a numerical\nmodel representation of Combustor A (Ref. 6).

As the F/A increases, the\n50:50 blend and the FT fuel temperatures decrease, ending\nwith cooler operating temperatures relative to JP\xe2\x80\x938 at the\n0.020 ratio. With respect to the increasing F/A, there is a\n\nUsing Figure 3, it is difficult to differentiate between the\ntemperature differences of the varied fuel blends. By\ncalculating the difference in temperatures read by the\nthermocouples at each location on the combustor for the blend\nand the 100 percent FT fuel relative to those recorded for\nJP\xe2\x80\x938, \xef\x81\x84T = Tfuel blend \xe2\x80\x93 TJP\xe2\x80\x938 (where \xe2\x80\x9cfuel blend\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a 0 to\n100 percent FT fuel blend with JP\xe2\x80\x938), a better sense for each\nfuel\xe2\x80\x99s performance may be obtained. Figure 4 illustrates the\ntrends seen for the average temperature differences in relation\nto F/A at (P,T)inlet = [125 psia (0.86 MPa), 625 \xef\x82\xb0F (603 K)] and\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217735\n\n5\n\nlarger deviation in the temperature performance of the FT and\n50:50 fuels. At the higher F/A, the FT fuel runs at\ntemperatures cooler than both the JP\xe2\x80\x938 and the blend,\nillustrating that at these higher F/A values, the impact of the\nFT performance within the blend decreases and JP\xe2\x80\x938\nperformance dominates. This would mean that at high F/A,\nthe FT fuel would decrease liner temperatures relative to the\nJP\xe2\x80\x938 and the 50:50 blend and could increase component life\nwithin the combustor and yet not the turbine. Also, greater\ntemperature differences are shown for higher inlet pressures\nand temperatures.\n\nPerforming the same analysis for all %\xef\x81\x84P conditions for\nboth the 100 percent and 50:50 FT fuel temperature difference\ndata, it is clear that increasing the inlet pressure increases the\ntemperature differences of the FT fuel compared to JP\xe2\x80\x938.\nThere also appears to be a peak in performance around 3 to\n4 percent \xef\x81\x84P for the alternate fuel in relation to the\nperformance of JP\xe2\x80\x938 (illustrated in Fig. 7).\nCalculated flame temperature data are outlined in Figure 8\nfor 225 psia (1.55 MPa) at 3 percent \xef\x81\x84P. As the inlet pressure\nand temperature is increased, there is a small increase in the\nflame temperature. The same trend is displayed with\nincreasing %\xef\x81\x84P, although %\xef\x81\x84P does not seem to affect the\ntemperature differences between the fuels to a significant\nextent. The %\xce\x94P trend is more pronounced than that of the\nchanging inlet pressure and temperature, especially when\nincreasing F/A. At higher F/A, there is a greater difference in\nflame temperatures between the fuels. The FT generally had\nhigher flame temperatures than the JP\xe2\x80\x938, and the 50:50 blend\ntemperatures fell to temperatures between the FT and the JP\xe2\x80\x938\nfuel. These trends are also displayed in Table IV, which\ncontains the flame temperature differences between JP\xe2\x80\x938 and\nthe FT fuels. No significant trend determining whether the FT\nor JP\xe2\x80\x938 performance had the dominant role in the flame\ntemperature performance of the 50:50 blend was found.\nBester and Yates (Ref. 8) compared SPK to Jet-A1 fueling\nin an RR-Allison T63\xe2\x80\x93A\xe2\x80\x93700 Model 250\xe2\x80\x93C18 B gas turbine\nengine and also cite approved FT-blended fuel use in civil\naviation flying from South Africa based on UK Ministry of\nDefense DEFSTAN 91\xe2\x80\x9391, Issue 3, 1999. It is gratifying to\nnote that using a modified combustor engine system similar to\nthat of Corporan et al. (Ref. 9), they found a 1.2-percent gain\nin turbine efficiency with SPK fueling over that of JetA-1\nalong with more favorable emissions. Although the present\nreport provides a more comprehensive and complete\ncomparisons of SPK to JetA-1 combustor performance for\ncurrent commercial aircraft (Fig. 1), it lacks the turbine engine\nperformance afforded by Bester and Yates including the cited\nincrease in turbine efficiency.\n\nCombustion Exhaust Rake Temperature\nThe exhaust plane temperature trends are illustrated in\nFigure 5. These temperature profiles represent data-averaged\ntemperature values collected through use of a temperature\nprobe (rake) placed in the exhaust plane of the combustor. In\nthese data, the signal from the top thermocouple was lost. For\nall data sets, there is a monotonic increase in the exhaust plane\ntemperature as F/A is increased. The increase in %\xef\x81\x84P also\ncreates an increase in the temperature. At higher %\xef\x81\x84P and F/A\nvalues, the FT fuel tends to run at higher exhaust temperatures\ncompared to JP\xe2\x80\x938 and the blend, which also gives slightly\nhigher temperatures. Upon further analysis, as F/A increases,\nthe FT fuel at higher exhaust plane temperature generally has\nless effect on the performance of the blend compared to that of\nJP\xe2\x80\x938. There is not a large temperature difference between the\nfuels at the higher %\xef\x81\x84P and F/A (\xef\x81\x84T = Tfuel blend \xe2\x80\x93 TJP\xe2\x80\x938 = \xef\x82\xbb20 to\n50 \xc2\xb0F (11 to 27 \xc2\xb0C)) where there are larger differences at higher\ninlet temperatures and pressures; however, a small change in\ntemperature can have major impact on the turbine life and\nefficiency, so these effects must be taken into consideration\nwhen selecting an alternative turbine engine fuel.\nPlotting the combustor exhaust rake temperature differences\nversus the inlet pressure and F/A (Fig. 6) displays a minimum,\nabove which the variables have a positive effect on the\ncombustor performance of alternate fuels over JP\xe2\x80\x938 fuels.\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217735\n\n6\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217735\n\n7\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217735\n\n8\n\nTABLE IV.\xe2\x80\x94FLAME TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCES \xef\x81\x84T FOR FT FUEL AND\n50:50 BLEND WITH RESPECT TO JP\xe2\x80\x938+100\n[Combustion at (P,T)inlet = [225 psia (1.55 MPa), 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K)].]\n%\xef\x81\x84P,\n\xef\x81\x84T = Tfuel blend \xe2\x80\x93 TJP\xe2\x80\x938,\npercent\n\xef\x82\xb0F (K)\nF/A = 0.010\nF/A = 0.010\nF/A = 0.010\nFuel blend\nFuel blend\nFuel blend\nFT\n50:50\nFT\n50:50\nFT\n50:50\n3\n73 (41)\n55 (31)\n94 (52)\n43 (24)\n34 (19)\n\xe2\x80\x933 (\xe2\x80\x932)\n4\n107 (59)\n90 (50)\n84 (47)\n41 (23)\n105 (58)\n42 (23)\n5\n71 (39)\n33 (18)\n63 (35)\n52 (29)\n90 (50)\n70 (39)\n\nabove ~0.015. At the higher F/A values the FT fuel\ntemperature differs more so from the JP\xe2\x80\x938 than the blend.\nPeak liner temperatures also increase with increasing F/A and\n%\xef\x81\x84P but seem unaffected by the type of fuel blend to a\nsignificant extent. Lower liner temperatures result from\ndecreased radiative heat transfer from reduced aromatic\ncontent.\nThe 100 percent FT fuel tends to run at higher exhaust\ntemperatures compared to the JP\xe2\x80\x938 and 50:50 blend fuels,\nwith a similar trend for flame temperature. Overall, increasing\nF/A and %\xef\x81\x84P increases the thermal performance of the\ncombustor, which will almost always occur unless there is a\ndecrease in the efficiency of combustion.\n\nConclusions\nThe data and analysis of combustor sector alternate fuel\nperformance of Combustor A show lower average liner\ntemperatures and higher flame and average combustor outlet\ntemperatures with increasing Fischer-Tropsch (FT) relative to\nJP\xe2\x80\x938+100 fueling. The combustor outlet temperature affects\nturbine efficiency and blade and vane lives and may be due to\nthe higher heat of combustion of the FT fuel per unit mass.\nThus, the engine would not be running at higher fuel:air ratio\n(F/A). A more accurate way to assess how these outlet\ntemperatures will affect the turbine life would be to look at the\npattern factor of the exhaust temperatures.\nSidewall temperatures depend mainly on F/A for\nperformance decreasing in temperature from the FWD to MID\nand increasing in temperature from the MID to AFT. The\nunwrapped liner temperature data show that the blend and the\nFT fuel run hotter than JP\xe2\x80\x938 at lower F/A, but cooler at F/A\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217735\n\nGlenn Research Center\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nCleveland, Ohio, September 10, 2013.\n\n9\n\n6.\n\nReferences\n1.\n\n2.\n3.\n\n4.\n5.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration: Press Release\xe2\x80\x94FAA\nAnnounces Alternative Energy Investments For Cleaner, More\nSustainable Jet Fuel. 2011.\nhttp://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=\n13254 Accessed Sept. 24, 2012.\nDiMascio, Jen: U.S. Navy Buys 450,000 Gallons Of Biofuel.\nAerospace Daily & Defense Report, McGraw-Hill Companies\nInc., New York, NY, 2011.\nWall Street Journal: The Cellulosic Ethanol Debacle.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES\n\n14. ABSTRACT\n\nIn order to realize alternative fueling for military and commercial use, the industry has set forth guidelines that must be met by each fuel.\nThese aviation fueling requirements are outlined in MIL-DTL-83133F(2008) or ASTM D 7566 Annex (2011) standards, and are classified\nas \xe2\x80\x9cdrop-in\xe2\x80\x9d fuel replacements. This report provides combustor performance data for synthetic-paraffinic-kerosene- (SPK-) type (FischerTropsch (FT)) fuel and blends with JP-8+100, relative to JP-8+100 as baseline fueling. Data were taken at various nominal inlet conditions:\n75 psia (0.52 MPa) at 500 \xc2\xb0F (533 K), 125 psia (0.86 MPa) at 625 \xc2\xb0F (603 K), 175 psia (1.21 MPa) at 725 \xc2\xb0F (658 K), and 225 psia (1.55\nMPa) at 790 \xc2\xb0F (694 K). Combustor performance analysis assessments were made for the change in flame temperatures, combustor\nefficiency, wall temperatures, and exhaust plane temperatures at 3, 4, and 5 percent combustor pressure drop (DP) for fuel:air ratios (F/A)\nranging from 0.010 to 0.025. Significant general trends show lower liner temperatures and higher flame and combustor outlet temperatures\nwith increases in FT fueling relative to JP-8+100 fueling. The latter affects both turbine efficiency and blade and vane lives.\n15.
