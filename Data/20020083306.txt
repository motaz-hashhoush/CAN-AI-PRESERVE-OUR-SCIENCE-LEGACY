The unit generates silver ions in the Orbiter\'s water system\nin concentrations of 50 to 100 parts in a\nbillion; the ions serve as bactericides and\ndeodorizers.\n\nThis technology has spawned a number of spinoff applications, the latest among\nthem the Ambassador line of bacteriostatic\nwater treatment systems exemplified above;\nthe mother pictured is demonstrating to an\ninterested tot the Space Saver 5000 unit,\ndesigned for compact kitchens with little\ncounter space.\nOther members of the new\nAmbassador line, shown at right, include the\nMagnum Pressure Unit, a Travel Unit, the\nIce Maker unit for refrigerators and the\nInvisible unit used under the kitchen\ncounter. All of the units employ high grade,\n\nhigh absorption media to inhibit bacteria\ngrowth and remove the medicinal taste and\nodor of chlorine.\nThe Ambassador bacteriostatic water\ndevices are marketed by Ambassador\nMarketing, Lebanon, Oregon, a new company formed by inventor Ray Ward, who was\namong the first to commercialize the Shuttle\nwater purification technology. In 1976, Ward\n\nsought to develop a water kilter for t l ~ own\ns\npersonal use to remove the "rusty" taste of\nhis local water supply. He learned of the\nNASA technology and requested a technical\ninformation package from NASA\'s Center\nfor Aerospace Information, Baltimore,\nMaryland. Using that information as a\ndeparture point, Ward invested $27 and\ndeveloped his own homemade device.\nl\nThe unit was so s ~ c e s s f uhe\nDel line of\nbegan marketing it as the\nwater filters, which boomed into a $50 million a year business. The new Ambassador\nline employs the same basic NASA-derived\ntechnology, but Ward has substantially\nrefined it and introduced new production\ntechnology for the smaller, highly efficient\nAmbassador units.\n\non\n\n'
