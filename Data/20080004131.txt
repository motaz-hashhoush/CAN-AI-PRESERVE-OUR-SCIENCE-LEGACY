The lower door 6 is connected with the\naperture\nl4 On One end, and moves freely in an\nUpWard and downward direction on tracks 15 on the other\nend. similarly, upper door 4 is connected to aperture assemblY l4 On One end while moving\nin an aPward and\ndownward direction on tracks 11 on the other end for the\nSame. purpose. The ability to move in unison allows the door\nassembly 2 to have a range of motion for positioning the\naperture assembly 14.\nReferring to FIG. 7, there is shown a portion of the\nfuselage 1 of an aircraft or other vehicle containing aperture\n17. Tracks 11 are mounted to the fuselage 1 above aperture\n17, while tracks 15 are mounted to the fuselage 1 below\naperture 17. Mounted to the fuselage 1 within the interior\ncompartment are rack gears 21 and guides 25. Rack gears 21\nengage aperture assembly drive pinion gears 20 (FIG. 5) to\nprovide a means for driving the aperture assembly 14\nupward and downward within aperture 17. Guides 25\nengage follower wheels 24 (FIG. 5) of the aperture assembly\n14 to provide a means for support for the aperture assembly\n14 as it travels upward and downward when driven by drive\nassembly 52 (FIG. 6).\nReferring now to FIG. 4, there is illustrated an exterior\nview of the aperture assembly 14. The aperture assembly 14\ndefines an a p e m e 36, Inner door pinions 18 engage racks\n34 (FIG. 8) on the interior surface of the inner door 8. Inner\ndoor tracks 22 (only one shown in FIG. 4) are located on\nboth the upstream and downstream sides of the a p e m e\nassembly 14 and though which lip (FIG. 2) of the inner\ndoor 8 travels when the inner door 8 is moved in an upward\nor downward direction. The upstream edge 46 of aperture 36\nis at nearly continuous ninety degree angles from any\ntangential point selected along the upstream edge 46 of the\nexterior surface of the aperture assembly 14. Intersecting the\nedge 46 is shear layer recovery surface 16. Shear\nlayer recovery surface 16 is a curved structure curving down\ninto the vehicle cavity and is convexly shaped in relation to\nthe airstream. The shear layer recovery surface 16 provides\na reattachment for the airstream detached at upstream edge\n46 of aperture 36 and promotes smooth reattachment of the\nairstream to the external surface of the vehicle. AS the\nairstream passes in the direction depicted by m o w s 38 and\n40 (FIG. l),the airstream detaches from the aperture assembly 14 at the upstream edge 46 of aperture 36 and then\ntravels over the aperture 36 toward the interior of the vehicle\ncavity. Smooth shear layer flow over aperture 36 is provided\nby the shear layer recovery surface 16 catching the airstream\nas it reattaches on the downstream edge 42 of aperture 36\nand reattaching the airstream from the aperture 36 to the\ndownstream vehicle surface.\n\n,\n\n5\n\nlo\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nReferring now to FIG. 5, there is illustrated an interior\nview of the aperture assembly 14.

As a drive\nmotor 28 drives shaft 30 so as to rotate aperture\ndrive pinion gears 20, the gears engage the fuselagemounted rack gears 21 (FIG. 7) to drive the aperture\nassembly 14\nor downward. Follower wheels 24 are\nprovided at the bottom of the interior surface of the aperture\nassembly 14 to engage guides 25 to assist the aperture\nassembly 14 as it travels along the fuselage-mounted rack\ngears 21 as the apeflue assembly 14 is driven Upwardly and\nby the drive\n52 (FIG. 6).\nRefemng now to FIG. 6, there is illustrated the drive\n52 which Operates to both \xe2\x80\x98pen and \xe2\x80\x98lose the\naperture 36, and to drive the aperture assembly 14 on\nfuselage-mounted rack gears 21 (FIG. 7). The drive assembly 52 is mounted on the interior surface of the a p e ~ e\nassembly 14 (FIG. 5), and includes the drive motor 28\ndriving parallel shafts 30 and 54 through a common transmission 26. Shaft 54 drives inner door pinion gears 18 (FIG.\n5) mounted on the exterior surface of the aperture assembly\n14. m e inner door pinion gears 18, in turn, engage racks 34\n(FIG. 8) on the interior surface of the inner door 8 for\nrevealing or concealing the aperture 36 with the inner door\n8.
