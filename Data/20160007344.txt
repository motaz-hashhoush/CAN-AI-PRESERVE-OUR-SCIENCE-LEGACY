b'ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND WE GO: BEHAVIOR OF ADULT FEMALE MICE ON THE ISS\nApril E. Ronca\nSpace Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA,\nObstetric & Gynecology, Program in Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine & Translational Science,\nWake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC\nThe NASA Decadal Survey (2011) emphasized the importance of long duration rodent experiments on the\nInternational Space Station (ISS). To accomplish this objective, flight hardware and science capabilities supporting\nmouse studies in space were developed at Ames Research Center. Here we present a video-based behavioral analysis\nof ten C57BL/6 female adult mice exposed to a total of 37 days in space compared with identically housed Ground\nControls. Flight and Control mice exhibited the same range of behaviors, including feeding, drinking, exploratory\nbehavior, grooming, and social interactions. Mice propelled themselves freely and actively throughout the Habitat\nusing their forelimbs to push off or by floating from one cage area to another. Overall activity was greater in Flt as\ncompared to GC mice. Spontaneous, organized \xe2\x80\x98circling\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98race-tracking\xe2\x80\x99 behavior emerged within the first few\ndays of flight and encompassed the primary dark cycle activity for the remainder of the experiment. I will\nsummarize qualitative observations and quantitative comparisons of mice in microgravity and 1g conditions.\nBehavioral phenotyping revealed important insights into the overall health and adaptation of mice to the space\nenvironment, and identified unique behaviors that can guide future habitat development and research on rodents in\nspace.\nSupported by the NASA Space Biology Program and Rodent Research Project.\n\n'
