Love3 and Scott Zink4\nLockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, Fort Worth, TX, 76108\nand\nTerrence A. Weisshaar5\nPurdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907\nThe Morphing Aircraft Structures (MAS) program is a Defense Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (DARPA) led effort to develop morphing flight vehicles capable of radical shape change in\nflight. Two performance parameters of interest are loiter time and dash speed as these define the\npersistence and responsiveness of an aircraft. The geometrical characteristics that optimize loiter\ntime and dash speed require different geometrical planforms. Therefore, radical shape change \xe2\x80\x93\nusually involving wing area and sweep \xe2\x80\x93 allows vehicle optimization across many flight regimes. The\nsecond phase of the MAS program consisted of wind tunnel tests conducted at the NASA Langley\nTransonic Dynamics Tunnel to demonstrate two morphing concepts and their enabling technologies\nwith large-scale semi-span models. This paper will focus upon one of those wind tunnel tests that\nutilized a model developed by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LM). Wind tunnel success\ncriteria were developed by NASA to support the DARPA program objectives. The primary focus of\nthis paper will be the demonstration of the DARPA objectives by systematic evaluation of the wind\ntunnel model performance relative to the defined success criteria. This paper will also provide a\ndescription of the LM model and instrumentation, and document pertinent lessons learned. Finally,\nas part of the success criteria, aeroelastic characteristics of the LM derived MAS vehicle are also\naddressed. Evaluation of aeroelastic characteristics is the most detailed criterion investigated in this\npaper. While no aeroelastic instabilities were encountered as a direct result of the morphing design\nor components, several interesting and unexpected aeroelastic phenomenon arose during testing.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nP\n\nHASE II of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Morphing Aircraft Structures (MAS)\nprogram is an effort to develop and evaluate morphing concepts in a wind tunnel environment to enable\ntechnologies for a future unmanned flight demonstrator program. As part of the DARPA Phase II program,\ncontracts were awarded to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LM) and NextGen Aeronautics Inc., for the\ndesign, fabrication, and testing of a wind tunnel MAS model. This paper will focus upon the LM variant of the\nMAS Phase II wind tunnel programs.\nFour entities were involved in the phase II testing of the LM MAS vehicle: DARPA, Lockheed Martin, the Air\nForce Research Laboratory (AFRL), and NASA. DARPA initiated the MAS program, funded the research and\ntesting, and guided the program by directing the test objectives. Lockheed Martin was the contractor tasked to\ndesign, fabricate, test, and analyze an operational MAS wind tunnel model. The role of AFRL was to serve as a\nprogram technical monitor and advisor to DARPA. The primary role of NASA was to supply and operate the wind\n1\n\nAerospace Engineer, Aeroelasticity Branch, MS 340, AIAA Member.\nSenior Aerospace Engineer, Aeroelasticity Branch, MS 340, AIAA Associate Fellow.\n3\nSenior Staff Engineer, AIAA Associate Fellow.\n4\nSenior Engineer, AIAA Associate Fellow.\n5\nProfessor, Former DARPA Program Manager, School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, AIAA Fellow.\n2\n\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ntunnel facility. Additionally, NASA acted as an agent to DARPA evaluating the model design process, assisting in\nthe development of the test plan, and evaluating the success of the wind tunnel test. As a result, NASA developed\nmeasurable wind tunnel success criteria to support the DARPA directed program objectives.\nThis paper is divided into four sections: definition of program objectives and test success criteria, model and\nwind tunnel description, results that satisfy the wind tunnel test success criteria, and lessons learned. Included in the\nmodel description section are the identified critical enabling technologies. The most detailed item of the test success\ncriteria section is an identification of the aeroelastic characteristics of the morphing concept. Included in this section\nis a background of the analysis, a comparison of the theoretical flutter boundary and experimental encounters, a\ndiscussion about the effects of morphing motion on dynamic vehicle response, and details regarding observed\ndynamics of the flexible skin.\nLockheed Martin researchers are writing a parallel paper for presentation at this conference providing more\ninformation about the model design, fabrication, and validation of their analytical design tools.1 Detailed\ncomparisons of analytical and experimental pressure and structural load data is provided in reference 1 in addition to\ncorrelation of the model with an envisioned flight demonstrator vehicle. Similarly, DARPA representatives are\nauthoring a paper detailing the MAS program and the significance of the Phase II results.2\n\nII. Definition of Program Objectives and Test Success Criteria\nA. Program Objectives\nThe MAS Phase II wind tunnel test program objectives, as identified by DARPA, were:\n1)\nDemonstrate morphing wing operability under realistic aerodynamic loads;\n2)\nObtain test data to validate analytical prediction methods for morphing aircraft;\n3)\nMinimize the departure of the wind tunnel model design and test conditions from those of the\nenvisioned flight demonstrator aircraft.\nB. Test Success Criteria\nIn order to achieve these program objectives, Lockheed Martin was tasked to design a wind tunnel model that\nallows for a radical shape change under aerodynamic loads representative of a steady state 1g flight condition and to\ncapture data for the validation of analytical prediction methods. The use of actual flight hardware was encouraged.\nConsidering these aspects of the program objectives, the following seven wind tunnel success criteria were\nidentified by NASA and endorsed by DARPA:\n1)\nDemonstrate actuation of the morphing structure with approximately 1g of aerodynamic load, without\nstructural failure or binding;\n[1g was determined from the envisioned flight vehicle gross weight and then scaled to match the\ndimensions of the wind tunnel model. At the TDT model scale, this equates to a full-span vehicle\ngross weight of 5400 lbs, and a semi-span model load of 2700 lbs.]\n2)\n\nDemonstrate model integrity and stability for varying configurations throughout a Mach range of 0.2 to\n0.9 and representative altitudes from 10,000 to 50,000 feet;\n[Facility capabilities, combined with the envisioned flight envelope, dictated the wind tunnel test\nmatrix.]\n\n3)\n\nIdentify aeroelastic characteristics associated with morphing structures and transition under air loads;\n[One of the unknowns prior to testing was the effect of the flexible morphing components and wing\nmotion on the aeroelastic characteristics of the model. The complex structure needs to demonstrate\nadequate static stiffness. Also, the wing motion associated with morphing transition and the actuator\nsystems must not induce an instability.]\n\n4)\n\nDemonstrate flexible skins and the resilience of those skins to air loads and actuation;\n[Morphing concepts often require large amounts of flexible skin on the wing surface. Significant and\nuncontrolled skin deformation may comprise the aerodynamic shape and alter vehicle performance.\nThis criterion was dictated to demonstrate the ability to withstand high velocity airflows and lift\ngenerated suction without significant skin deformation.]\n\n5)\n\nDemonstrate successful use of flight representative hardware to operate the actuation systems;\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n[This and the following two criteria were specified as measurable enabling features required for the\ndevelopment of a future flight demonstrator vehicle.]\n6)\n7)\n\nDemonstrate successful mating of the morphing structures and seamless gap closures;\nAcquire specified sets of wind tunnel data to correlate with design analysis.\n\nIII. Model and Wind Tunnel Description\nA. General Model Characteristics\nLockheed Martin developed a double-hinged folding-wing concept of a flying-wing vehicle. The wind tunnel\nmodel was a semi-span half-scale representation of this vehicle concept. A multiple-exposure photograph of the\nmodel mounted in the wind tunnel is shown in figure 1. Figure 1 captures the morphing motion at different stages of\nactuation from a loiter configuration, in which the wing is fully extended, to the dash configuration, in which the\nwing is fully folded. To operate the wing fold system, the wind tunnel model used two electrically slaved motors\nand a drive train system. In order to close the gap between the inboard wing and fuselage in the dash configuration,\na thermopolymer actuator was developed to drive a leading edge flap. Flexible skin material was utilized across the\nwing fold and flap regions. The inclusion of these skins was necessary to maintain a clean outer mold line while\nstill permitting radical wing shape change. To minimize skin deformation, a vacuum system was developed to\nmaintain suction on the seamless skins and hold them against the wing internal structure.\n\nFigure 1. Multiple Exposure Photograph of Lockheed Martin MAS Wind Tunnel Model During a Morphing\nSequence\nLockheed Martin is writing a parallel conference paper which presents significantly more details about the model\ndesign, components, and fabrication.1 To summarize, the semi-span wind tunnel model dimensions were1,3:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wing area (loiter) = 62.5 ft2\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Span (loiter) = 9.3 ft\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Length = 13.6 ft\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Model weight ~ 1700 lbs\nBy actuating the wing fold system from the dash to the loiter position, the model experienced the following\nplanform changes1,3:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 2.8x wing area increase\n\xe2\x80\xa2 1.7x span increase\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1.3x increase in wetted area\n30 deg wing sweep change of the \xc2\xbd chord\n\nThis large model dimension was driven by the DARPA requirement to use actuation and structural concepts\nrepresentative of a future flight demonstrator. Unfortunately, this large size resulted in unanticipated coupling with\nthe wind tunnel support system flexibility. Also, because of its size, the model extended outside of the region of the\ntest section in which flow conditions are constant, making it more difficult to validate CFD predictions.\nCritical enabling technologies for satisfying the wind tunnel success criteria and preparing for a future flight\ndemonstrator vehicle were identified by Lockheed Martin and briefly described here.\n1. Seamless Skin Material\nTwo skin materials were investigated: re-enforced silicone elastomeric for use in the wind tunnel model, and\nshape memory polymers envisioned for the flight vehicle. The shape memory polymer material was not adequately\ndeveloped within the schedule allotted for the wind tunnel model entry. Further development will result in a stiffer\nmaterial and a better airfoil outer mold line across the wing fold areas. Also, shape memory material may eliminate\nthe need for a vacuum otherwise required to stabilize the silicone elastomeric material when exposed to airflow.\n2. Seamless Skin Support Structure\nDue to the flexibility of the seamless skins, a complex substructure was developed in the wing fold regions\nhousing wing structure, actuation components, instrumentation, and vacuum tubes. This structure also had to\nprovide the basis for an airfoil shape and allow for 130 degrees of wing fold while withstanding load deformation.\nPerhaps a preferred technology would be the development of a more rigid skin eliminating the need for a\nsubstructure to support it under aerodynamic loads. This would also allow for better distribution of load through the\nfold regions and possibly a reduction in structural weight.\n3. Thermopolymer Actuators\nFor the leading edge flap actuator, an increase in reliability and a reduction in weight, complexity, and operating\ntime of the thermopolymer actuator are required for application to a flight vehicle. Also, further development of the\nenvisioned wing fold actuators is needed if desired for flight vehicle use.\n4. Wing Fold Control\nIn order to reliably change shape in a flight vehicle, precise, repeatable, stable, and symmetrical wing actuation\nis required. The wind tunnel model accomplished morphing actuation using two commercial off-the-shelf\nelectrically slaved drive motors with a position feedback control system developed by Minarik Automation and\nControl.\nB. Model Instrumentation and Data Acquisition\nThe wind tunnel model was mounted to a five component strain gauge balance that measured normal and axial\nforces, and pitch, roll, and yaw moments. Connected to the balance was a standard TDT supporting strut which is\ndriven in rotation about the pitch axis to control angle of attack. Lift and drag were calculated from the balance\nforce components and corrected for model angle of attack. Model angle of attack was measured with a Q-flex\naccelerometer mounted in the fuselage near the balance. Wing fold angles were measured with potentiometers, and\nthe wing fold drive train position was measured with drive motor position counters. Additional instrumentation\nincluded 37 steady pressure taps, 14 high response unsteady pressure transducers, eight accelerometers, and strain\ngauges. Strain gauge measurements were used to calculate wing-fold-line hinge moments at seven different\nlocations and axial load on the leading edge flap actuator rod.\nData was sampled at a rate of 500 Hz and low-pass filtered at 200 Hz. Nominal data samples were five seconds\nin length and morphing sequences were extended to 75 second records.\nC. Wind Tunnel Facility\nWind tunnel testing was conducted in the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) because of the\nfacility\xe2\x80\x99s large test section, Mach number range, and variable pressure capabilities. Also, the TDT is a dedicated\naeroelastic test facility designed for high risk dynamic testing and has built-in safety features such as a rapid flow\nspeed reduction capability, observation windows, and a model catch screen. The TDT has a 16 x 16 feet test section\nand can produce continuous flow speeds from near zero to a Mach number of 1.2 in either air or R134a heavy gas.\nTotal pressure within the tunnel can be varied from a near vacuum to sea level. Maximum Reynolds number is\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nnearly 10 million per foot in heavy gas. Reference 4 describes the wind tunnel in detail and includes operational\nenvelopes and tunnel characteristics.\n\nIV. Results\nThe results from the test and analysis of the LM MAS model are presented in the context of the seven success\ncriteria enumerated earlier in this paper.\nA. Success Criterion 1: Demonstrate actuation of morphing structure with approximately 1g of aerodynamic\nload, without structural failure or binding.\nFigure 2 shows a 75 second data record acquired during a morphing sequence under a constant 1g aerodynamic\nload. Presented in figure 2 are the wing fold angles, model angle of attack (AOA), lift, and inboard and outboard\nmotor torques.\n\nFigure 2. Constant 1g Morphing Sequence at Mach 0.6\nDuring this actuation sequence, the wing was folded from the loiter (0 deg wing fold) to the dash (130 deg wing\nfold) position. The motor torque presented is in percent of the maximum continuous rated torque for each drive\nmotor. One can see that the inboard motor is under very little load since the aerodynamic loads act in the direction\nof wing motion until the final phases of folding. The outboard motor torque, however, is much larger since it is\nmoving in a direction opposing the aerodynamic load. The sign of the motor torque indicates the direction that the\nmotor torque is being applied.\nAlso shown is the AOA which was manually controlled in an attempt to maintain a constant lift. The wandering\nof the mean lift value was caused by an inexact manual control of AOA. The significant increase in AOA required\nto maintain a constant lift is an indicator of the drastic wing area change achieved by this vehicle. With the wing in\nthe loiter configuration, an AOA of approximately 4.3 degrees generated 1g of lift. By comparison, the wing in the\ndash configuration required an AOA of 11.2 degrees to produce the same lift.\nUnplanned asymmetric wing morphing would be a catastrophic occurrence on an actual flight vehicle. In order\nto project the ability to morph in controlled flight with a semi-span model demonstration, one must analyze the\nprecision and repeatability of the wing actuation. These data show smooth wing operation without ratcheting,\nbinding, or controller feedback instabilities. Equally important is that the same wing fold drive train position was\nachieved for a given command position regardless of aerodynamic load.\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nUnfolding the wing from the dash to loiter configuration presented a unique problem under high aerodynamic\nloads. Motor current from the more critically loaded outboard motor was fed back into the control system to\nmonitor drive motor limits. During an unfolding sequence, the aerodynamic loads acted in the direction of outboard\nwing motion. At 1g lift conditions, the outboard motor became a generator at wing fold angles between 100 to 120\ndegrees. As a result, the controller detected a motor current error and halted the wing motion. For lift conditions\nless than 1g, this current feedback was not an issue during the unfolding sequence. Also, morphing in the opposite\ndirection, where the motion of the outboard wing opposed the aerodynamic loads, did not cause an error. Minarik,\nthe developer of the wing fold controller, had identified a solution by implementing a resistor into the control\nsystem. However, it was determined that this modification was unnecessary since the morphing concept had already\nmet the test objectives.\nA series of three 1g unfolding data sequences were taken with the wing motion restarted after resetting the\ncontroller error. A compilation of these data sequences is shown in figure 3.\nData\nData\nSequence 1 Sequence 2\n\nData\nSequence 3\n\nFigure 3. Constant 1g Morphing Sequence at Mach 0.6\nFor comparison, a smooth actuation sequence from the Dash to Loiter configuration is shown in figure 4 for a\nload of approximately 0.7g.\n\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 4. Constant 0.7g Morphing Sequence at Mach 0.6\nB. Success Criterion 2: Demonstrate model integrity and stability for varying configurations throughout a\nMach range of 0.2 to 0.9 and representative altitudes from 10,000 to 50,000 feet.\nThe test conditions varied from Mach numbers of 0.2 to 0.9, and total pressures corresponding to altitudes from\n8,000 to 70,000 feet. Not all configurations were tested at all conditions. Most morphing sequences were conducted\nat 0.6 Mach number and a representative altitude of approximately 30,000 feet.\nIn addition to morphing the wing and maintaining a constant lift condition, angle of attack sweeps were\nperformed for many static wing fold angles and tunnel conditions. At several wind tunnel conditions, the model was\ntaken beyond stall to a max angle of attack of 17 degrees in order to develop high angle data sets. Also, the static\naerodynamic load was carried out to a maximum of approximately 1.5g to verify structural integrity of the actuation\nsystem. Integrity was demonstrated by the drive system\xe2\x80\x99s ability to maintain position under loads in excess of 1g\nwithout slippage. Shown in figure 5 is measured wing fold angle as a function of lift for three different nominal\nwing fold angles. The departures from nominal are indicative of the elastic deformation of the supporting structure.\nThese elastic deflections are indicative of the flexibility expected in a flight vehicle, and therefore demonstrate the\nobjective of providing a wind tunnel model with structures representative of a flight vehicle in the presence of\nmorphing. During all of these wind tunnel conditions, the drive train system maintained a fixed commanded\nposition.\n\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 5. Measured Wing Fold Angles at Varying Load Conditions, Mach=0.6.\n\nC. Success Criterion 3: Identify aeroelastic characteristics associated with morphing structures and\ntransition under air loads.\n1. Background\nFlutter and divergence analyses were conducted by Lockheed Martin using NASTRAN finite element models\ncoupled with doublet lattice aerodynamics. Validation of the flutter prediction methods was not an intentional goal\nof the wind tunnel test. Original LM predictions showed flutter dynamic pressures in the thousands of psf for all\n\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nintended Mach numbers. The expected wind tunnel test boundary was limited to 200 psf in dynamic pressure.\nTherefore, flutter was considered a non-issue throughout model design and fabrication.\nAfter balance selection, LM updated the flutter analysis to include balance flexibility. The results showed that\nthe predicted flutter boundary dropped to approximately 550 psf for the 65 deg wing fold configuration. These\nflutter analyses, with a soft-in-pitch balance, showed significant coupling between pitch and wing bending modeshapes of the model. The predicted flutter mode was a pitch motion of the model about the balance. Additional\nanalyses with parameter variations revealed a significant sensitivity to pitch stiffness. Concern then arose regarding\nthe stiffness of the TDT supporting strut that connects the model to the wind tunnel wall.\nAn initial estimate of the stiffness of the TDT supporting strut was conducted by NASA. This initial estimate\nshowed the pitch stiffness of the supporting strut to be orders of magnitude greater than the balance. Therefore, the\nflutter analysis of the model and balance on a rigid backstop was considered to be an accurate prediction.\nA detailed Ground Vibration Test (GVT) was conducted of the model with the flexible balance integrated and\nthe system mounted on a nearly rigid backstop. Modes and frequencies correlated well the structural finite element\nmodel. Upon installing the model in the tunnel, however, it was discovered through an abbreviated GVT that the\nsupporting strut was considerably more flexible in pitch than anticipated. (Details regarding the overestimated strut\nstiffness, and post-test flutter analyses using updated stiffness are provided in the lessons learned section.)\nSince the 65 deg wing fold configuration produced the lowest flutter dynamic pressure in previous analyses, new\nflutter analyses were conducted on this configuration with the reduced stiffness. While this flutter analysis was\nbeing done, wind tunnel testing began with configurations thought to be less flutter critical, specifically the zero\ndegree wing fold configuration. Unexpectedly, flutter was encountered with this configuration. After\nexperimentally reaching the flutter condition, LM analytically determined that the critical flutter configuration with\nthe more flexible strut was indeed zero degrees wing fold.\nFigure 6 shows the analytical flutter boundaries for a rigid backstop and the updated boundaries with the flexible\nsupporting strut for Mach numbers 0.6 and 0.8.\n\nFigure 6. Analytical Flutter Boundaries with Flexible Balance.\n\n2. Comparison of Analytical and Experimental Flutter Results\nCorrelations of the predicted flutter dynamic pressures, with the flexible strut modeled, and experimental trends\nat a Mach number of 0.6 were good. Although an experimental flutter condition was not experienced at a Mach\nnumber of 0.6, numerous test conditions that were close to the predicted flutter boundary produced high dynamic\nresponses that were indicative of a pending flutter condition. To avoid model and facility damage, testing was\nhalted short of an actual flutter encounter. Additionally, the dynamic response of the model was greatly reduced at\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nhigh wing fold angles commensurate with the prediction trends. Test experience and observed model behavior\nprovide confidence in the flutter prediction values at a Mach number of 0.6.\nAnalytical flutter predictions for a Mach number of 0.8 were not as accurate as the 0.6 Mach number results and\nwere non-conservative by comparison to the experimental results. Understandably, the flutter condition is not\nexpected to be predicted well with doublet lattice aerodynamics for a thick airfoil at high transonic speeds where\nviscous effects become important. An experimental flutter condition was encountered at a dynamic pressure of 138\npsf for the zero degree wing fold configuration, compared to a value of 153 psf predicted in the analysis.\nFor the 45 deg wing fold configuration and a Mach number of 0.8, however, flutter experimentally occurred\nsignificantly below the predicted dynamic pressure value shown in figure 6. As shown in figure 6, the analysis\npredicts a flutter dynamic pressure of approximately 275 psf, whereas the model experimentally encountered flutter\nat approximately 155 psf.\nAfter further investigation, LM discovered that the critical flutter mode for wing fold angles in the vicinity of 45\nand 65 degrees is a different mechanism than the zero degree fold angle. In these intermediate fold configurations, a\nmode with fore-aft motion on the outboard panel couples with a torsion motion of the inboard wing and a full-body\npitch/yaw motion about the balance and supporting strut, as illustrated by figure 7, and becomes the critical flutter\nmode shape. A v-g analysis shows this second flutter mode to be a \xe2\x80\x9chump mode\xe2\x80\x9d characterized by a shallow\ncrossing and a shallow return over a small range of velocities. The value of damping for this mode was near zero\nover the entire range of velocities and the crossing was initially overlooked during the flutter boundary analysis.\nBoth analytical flutter modes are strong functions of wing fold angle. Figure 8 shows these modes identified as\n\xe2\x80\x9canalysis mode 1\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9canalysis mode 2\xe2\x80\x9d vs. fold angle. Predicted flutter dynamic pressure at 0.8 Mach number and\n45 degrees of wing fold is approximately 170 psf for the second mode, which is significantly closer to the\nexperimental result. Figure 8 also includes the experimental flutter conditions encountered at a Mach number of 0.8.\n\nFigure 7. Critical Flutter Mode Shape for 45 Degree Wing Fold\n\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 8. Flutter Dynamic Pressure as a Function of Wing Fold Angle. Flexible Strut. Mach = 0.8\n\n3. Dynamic Response During Morphing Sequences\nWing morphing operation was conducted near the expected flutter boundary at a Mach number of 0.6. As the\nwing moved through all fold positions, the dynamic response of the wing while moving was similar to the dynamic\nresponse of the wing at each fold position while stationary. Therefore, no additional dynamics or instabilities were\nattributed to the motion of the wing or the actuation components.\nD. Success Criterion 4: Demonstrate flexible skins and the resilience of those skins to air loads and actuation.\nFigure 9 is an underside view of the model in the loiter configuration. Easily visible in this photograph are the\nflexible seamless skins positioned along the wing fold hinge lines and the leading edge flap. Throughout testing, the\nskins proved to be generally robust and also easily repairable when tears occurred around a stress concentration area.\nAdditionally, the wind tunnel test exposed the flexible skins to transonic flow and lift loads in excess of 1g. Cavity\nvacuum pressures were recorded at each test condition, and minimum required pressures were determined. During\nalmost all of the test conditions, the flexible skins demonstrated resilience to the air loads, maintained the desired\nshape, and did not exhibit any \xe2\x80\x9cflag waving\xe2\x80\x9d or other visible dynamics. There were three conditions out of the\nthousands tested, however, where significant skin motion was observed by the test team. Although these\noccurrences of skin dynamics were rare, the characteristics are interesting and are therefore discussed in detail\nbelow.\n\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 9. Lockheed Martin MAS Model Mounted in TDT\nDuring testing at 0.8 Mach number and 45 degrees wing fold angle, the first condition exhibiting skin dynamics\nwas encountered. This incident has direct application to any full-scale flight vehicle that would employ this type of\ndesign and reveals the importance of understanding and being able to predict the dynamics of the flexible skin used\nin the wing fold regions of the model. At this test condition the following events occurred in rapid sequence:\nsealant tape that bonds the inboard flexible skin to the fuselage was seen to depart the wind tunnel model;\nimmediately following tape departure, traveling waves developed in the flexible skin; shortly after the establishment\nof traveling waves, the model experienced flutter that led test engineers to rapidly terminate testing.\nSubsequent data examination revealed that following the departure of the sealant tape, the pressure in the wing\ncavity beneath the flexible skin dropped to about the level of the suction pressure on the wing upper surface, thereby\ninciting the traveling wave. Also, the frequency of the sustained traveling wave is approximately half that of the\nflutter mode. It is not believed that the oscillation of the flexible skin caused the model to flutter since the revised\nflutter analysis reveals the existence of the second mode instability at this condition. However, it is believed that the\nmotion of the flexible skin may have helped trigger the flutter incident.\nFigure 10 contains a plot of the unsteady pressure data from a high response total pressure transducer located on\nthe upper surface near the inboard skin leading edge. The unsteady values plotted in figure 10 are the measured total\npressure data with the free stream static pressure value subtracted. Also, the flexible skin cavity pressure is plotted\nas measured by a steady pressure system referenced to free stream static.\nOne can see a relatively constant cavity pressure at the beginning of the data record. The cavity pressure then\nundergoes an excursion, corresponding to a loss of sealant tape, followed by a rise in cavity pressure. As the cavity\npressure rises to approximately -0.45 psi, the first traveling wave of the skin is observed. As the wave passes the\nunsteady pressure transducer, a pressure impulse is recorded from what is believed to be a local shock wave moving\nwith the traveling wave on the flexible skin. As the cavity pressure continues to rise, the traveling waves become\nmore frequent as recorded by additional impulses in the unsteady pressure measurement. At approximately 56\nseconds, the traveling waves become regular in frequency followed by model flutter onset at approximately 58\nseconds. The sharp rise in pressure seen at approximately 60 seconds is the result of an emergency reduction of\nflow velocity, referred to as a \xe2\x80\x9ctunnel bypass.\xe2\x80\x9d Finally, one can also notice that the cavity pressure values fluctuate\nerratically during the traveling wave occurrences. Pressure fluctuations within the cavity would be expected due to\nthe changes in cavity volume caused by the lifting and falling of the flexible skin. The cavity pressures presented in\nfigure 10 were measured with a steady pressure system that requires settling time for accurate measurements. Thus,\nwhile the trends are believed to be captured, the values are not accurate.\n\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 10. Pressure Data Acquired During Sustained Traveling Waves, 45 deg Wing Fold.\nThe observed motion of the flexible skin exhibits some of the characteristics of traveling wave panel flutter that\ncan occur during transonic speeds.5 One such characteristic is the speed of the traveling wave. Figure 11 is a plot of\ndata from two high response unsteady pressure transducers located on the upper surface near the inboard skin. This\ndata record was acquired during sustained traveling wave oscillations at 0.8 Mach number and the time sequence is a\nsubset of the data presented in figure 10. Physical separation between the upstream and downstream pressure\ntransducers was 56.29 inches. Temporal separation between pulses observed by each transducer was a consistent\n0.193 seconds. Combining the physical and temporal separations revealed a traveling wave speed of 292 inches per\nsecond (24.3 feet per second). If one employs the equations for predicting traveling wave speed contained in\nreference 5 and uses rough estimates for the density and tension of the flexible skins, the resulting speed is in\nreasonable agreement with 24.3 feet per second. This result adds confidence to the suspicion that this observed\ntraveling wave was indeed panel flutter.\n\n13\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 11. Unsteady Pressures Near Inner Wing Fold Line,\nMach 0.8, 45 deg Wing Fold, During Sustained Traveling Wave Motion.\nA similar sequence of events, vacuum pressure loss \xe2\x80\x93 traveling wave motion of the skin \xe2\x80\x93 model dynamics, also\noccurred at a Mach number of 0.9. In this second event, the model angle of attack was at 4.5 degrees and the\noccurrence was sensitive to model angle of attack. The model dynamic motion observed during this second\noccurrence was more representative of a limit cycle oscillation rather than a divergent flutter oscillation.\nFinally, a different type of skin motion was observed, representative of a standing wave, on the outboard skin\nnear the leading edge at 0.8 Mach number and angles of attack in the vicinity of 9 degrees. In this third encounter,\nthe tunnel dynamic pressure was low and no significant vibrations of the model were measured. Once again the skin\nvacuum pressure was at a reduced value due to system leakages that were later corrected.\nSince these three observed occurrences were rare and precipitated by vacuum system leakages or improper\npressures, it was determined that the flexible skin successfully met criterion 4.\nE. Success Criterion 5. Demonstrate successful use of flight representative hardware to operate the actuation\nsystems.\nDetailed in references 1 and 3 is the structural design of the model incorporating realistic flight hardware. An\nexample of this is the use of F-16 leading edge flap actuators to carry the loads through the hinge lines and operate\nthe wing fold motion. Additionally, the vehicle skin and spar design mimicked that of a semi-monocoque flight\nvehicle including critically loaded composite parts. All components performed well allowing the model to be tested\nto the maximum anticipated loads.\nF. Success Criterion 6: Demonstrate successful mating of the morphing structures and seamless gap closures.\nThis criterion was developed as a result of lessons learned from the swing-wing wind tunnel tests conducted\nduring the development of the F-111 and the F-14.6 The intent was to demonstrate the ability of the wind tunnel\nmodel to obtain a seamless mating of the moving wing surface and the fuselage. To address this criterion, Lockheed\nMartin designed the leading edge flap with the purpose of closing the gap between the inboard wing and fuselage\nwhen the model was in the dash configuration. However, the elastic deflection of the wing under aerodynamic load\nwas not known prior to testing. Therefore, the motion of the wing and leading edge flap was intentionally stopped\nshort of making contact with the fuselage. While the incorporation of this flap was a novel approach to this\nrequirement, a tighter tolerance in closing the gap would be required in order to fully meet this criterion.\n\n14\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nG. Success Criterion 7: Acquire specified sets of wind tunnel data to correlate with design analysis.\nA multitude of wind tunnel data was acquired including balance data, steady and unsteady pressure data,\nstructural loads, and accelerations. Lockheed Martin conducted detailed comparisons of the wind tunnel data with\nCFD analyses and finite element model structural load predictions. Comparisons of the wind tunnel data with the\nLockheed Martin predictions are presented in reference 1.\n\nV. Lessons Learned\nIn an effort to aid future wind tunnel tests of morphing aircraft, several lessons learned during this wind tunnel test\nare documented below.\nA. Support Strut Stiffness\nThe LM MAS wind tunnel model was the heaviest sidewall-mounted model ever tested in the forty-seven year\nhistory of the TDT. Upon model installation, the support strut was found to be significantly more flexible in pitch\nthan anticipated. This unexpected loss of stiffness lowered the flutter dynamic pressure of the model to within the\ndesired wind tunnel test envelope. A better understanding of the wind tunnel support strut stiffness would have\nprevented the unexpected flutter encounters. Experimental data now exists documenting the current stiffness of the\nTDT sidewall strut. Future wind tunnel tests of large sidewall-mounted models need to consider the support strut\nstiffness in order to properly understand possible coupling of model and support system dynamics.\nAfter post-test inspection of the strut assembly and further analysis, the difference in expected vs. actual pitch\nstiffness can be attributed to the following:\n1) The pitch stiffness of the strut is less than anticipated due to a calculation error committed by NASA.\nThis error accounts for about 5% of the loss in stiffness.\n2) Undersized bolts were discovered on the pitch drive mechanism. These bolts would loosen with changes\nin AOA causing a loss in stiffness and introducing free play. Incorrect shoulder bolts were also\ndiscovered on a connecting arm that failed to engage the bolt shoulders across the pitch drive mechanism.\nThe incorrect bolts account for approximately 35% of the loss in stiffness.\n3) The pitch drive system attachment, electric motor drive system, and bearings are difficult to analytically\nmodel and consist of large components. Due to the size of these components, they were originally\nmodeled as rigid connections to the support strut. Calculations were done of the drive system jackscrew\nconnection and other hardware components which predicted high stiffness. The source of this additional\nflexibility is not entirely understood. Experimental results, however, indicate that the remainder of the\nloss in stiffness is attributed to these components.\nFollowing the Lockheed Martin MAS test, correct bolts were installed (item 2) on the support strut system that\nincreased its stiffness and eliminated free play. NASA conducted new flutter analyses with this increased pitch\nstiffness by making slight modifications to the boundary conditions in the NASTRAN finite element model. The\nanalysis shows that the flutter boundary is extremely sensitive to pitch stiffness, and results indicate that the test\ncould now be run without encountering flutter within the desired test envelope.\nB. Lowered Flutter Dynamic Pressure at Moderate Fold Angles\nThe LM MAS wind tunnel model accomplished morphing by a novel mechanization of out-of-plane wing\nfolding. Through analysis and test, the flutter dynamic pressure was found to be a strong function of wing fold\nangle. It was learned through post-test flutter analyses that the critical flutter mode changes as fold angle varies.\nFor fold angles between approximately zero and 20 degrees, and between 80 and 130 degrees the flutter mode is\ncharacterized by a full-body pitch motion about the balance and supporting strut. However, fold angles between\napproximately 20 and 80 degrees, the critical flutter mode is characterized by an in-plane motion of the outboard\nwing coupled with a torsion motion of the inboard wing and a full-body pitch/yaw motion about the balance and\nsupporting strut. Additionally, ongoing research at NASA indicates that a coupling between in-plane motion and\npitch can induce flutter at a lower dynamic pressure when there is a vertical offset in center of gravity. Moderate\nwing fold angles in the vicinity of 45 degrees can aggravate such a coupling.\nThe lesson learned is that close attention must be paid to this mode of vibration during flutter analyses with\nmoderate fold angles. The small damping magnitude combined with the instability only existing for a select range\nof velocities makes this an easy mode to overlook. LM is applying this lesson in the analysis of a similarly designed\nunmanned flight demonstrator aircraft.\n\n15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nC. Wing Fold Control\nAs the drive motor power was turned off, brakes were engaged to hold wing position. As actuation system\npower was cycled off and on, a slight amount of brake slippage allowed a small drive train slippage undetected by\nthe wing fold controller. Continuous power cycles would lead to a slight offset in desired vs. actual wing position\nover time. During the wind tunnel test, the wing position was re-zeroed at the beginning of each day and checked at\nthe end of each wind-on period. Wing position was found to remain within acceptable levels for all test conditions,\nand position error was slightly larger than the threshold of detection after hours of continuous cycles. However, a\nflight vehicle should employ a method to retain the drive train position measurement without power applied in order\nto eliminate the need to re-zero wing position readings on a daily basis.\nD. Effects of Wing Fold Motion on Balance Data\nTypical TDT data acquisition system routines involve an angle of attack correction applied to balance loads.\nAdjustments in balance orientation change the internal loadings due to gravity, which must be subtracted to correctly\nobtain the externally applied aerodynamic loads. The LM morphing aircraft, however, creates an additional problem\ndue to the shift in CG associated with wing motion. Therefore, a two-dimensional weight tare routine was\ndeveloped by the TDT data system team to support this test. Balance check loads confirmed that the actual external\nload could be measured to within one percent accuracy in all components regardless of the angle of attack or wing\nfold position. Anticipation of this requirement and the experimental trials prior to wind tunnel entry made this\ndevelopment possible. Therefore, this requirement must also be anticipated for future morphing designs to permit\nproper weight-tare corrections.\nE. Seamless Skin Characteristics\nThe seamless skins produced an unexpected amount of \xe2\x80\x9cstiction\xe2\x80\x9d with the underlying finger skin structure. This\ncaused unpredictable and unusual readings on wing fold hinge moments during actuation. Additionally, this created\na large amount of hysteresis since the stiction would stress the skin differently depending upon the direction of\nmotion. This unusual loading required a complicated skin-tare data routine to determine the aerodynamic hinge\nmoments from the total measured loads. Extensive post-test data reduction was required of the TDT data system\nteam to extract the aerodynamic loads for each test condition.\nAdditionally, to maintain their shape the flexible skins required a vacuum system when exposed to aerodynamic\nloads. This system worked well throughout most of the test, however, loss of suction during some conditions\nresulted in significant skin dynamics. As a result of the wind tunnel test, the minimum required vacuum pressures\nwere determined for the varying conditions.\nF. Motor Current Feedback Problem\nAs discussed in the section detailing success criterion 1, the wing actuation system experienced a current\nfeedback problem associated with morphing from dash to loiter configurations under 1g load. The actuation system\ndesign did not anticipate the aerodynamic load acting in the direction of desired motion. As previously mentioned, a\nsolution was identified but deemed unnecessary to accomplish the test objectives. Therefore, future actuation\nsystems need to consider aerodynamic loads that act in the desired direction of wing morphing and not only the\nloads that oppose the wing morphing motion.\n\nVI. Conclusion\nThe Lockheed Martin Variant of the MAS phase II wind tunnel program successfully met all DARPA directed\nobjectives. The validity of the morphing design was quantified by the wind tunnel test success criteria. The model\nwas able to morph under a 1g load and maintained a constant structural position under loads in excess of 1g. Wing\nfold position was accurately controlled and was predictable and repeatable lending confidence about the ability to\ncontrol a full-span flight vehicle. Data presented here documents the loading encountered for varying wing fold\nangles at different angles of attack. Many structural components utilized realistic aircraft design features and actual\ncomponents.\nThe data acquired during different morphing configurations can be used to study fuselage/wing interactions and\ndynamic response due to wing motion. Furthermore, the presented lessons learned and difficulties that were\nencountered will aid future wind tunnel programs of morphing vehicles.\nNo aeroelastic instabilities were encountered due to the wing actuation or morphing systems. However, due to\nthe unexpected support strut flexibility, aeroelastic instabilities were observed. One occurrence in particular brought\nattention to a mode-switching characteristic that may impact the analysis of a future flight demonstrator.\n16\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAdditionally, after a vacuum failure the model encountered a flutter condition immediately following significant\nflexible skin dynamics. It cannot be concluded that the flexible skin dynamics played a role in the vehicle dynamics,\nhowever, the occurrence prior to a flutter onset is interesting to note. Finally, post-test modifications to the wind\ntunnel support strut have increased its pitch stiffness. Recent flutter analyses, that include the increased stiffness,\npredict that the LM MAS model could test within its entire desired envelope without experiencing flutter.\n\nAcknowledgments\nMany organizations contributed to the development and completion of the MAS wind tunnel test program.
