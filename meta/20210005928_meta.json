The discipline covers such topics as speci\ufb01cation-based monitoring, where single executions are checked against formal speci\ufb01cations; predictive runtime analysis, where properties about a system are predicted/inferred from single (good) executions; speci\ufb01cation mining from execution traces; visualization of execution traces; and to be fully general: computation of any interesting information from execution traces. Finally, runtime veri\ufb01cation also includes fault protection, where monitors actively protect a running system against errors. The paper is written as a response to the \u2018Test of Time Award\u2019 attributed to the authors for their 2001 paper [45]. The present paper provides a brief overview of what lead to that paper, what has happened since, and some perspectives on the future of the \ufb01eld.", "title": "Runtime Verification - 17 Years Later", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210005928, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rosu, Grigore"}}, "id": "ccd029c8e63a43dda0ac2b5856df7753"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210005928, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Havelund, Klaus"}}, "id": "20b23328d87e4d528da20f3f14a42b88"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T04:57:26.7309200+00:00", "id": 20210005928, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/48804", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210005928, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2018", "id": "48a4018f72d3411987bf12f5afb0f97b", "publicationDate": "2018-10-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
