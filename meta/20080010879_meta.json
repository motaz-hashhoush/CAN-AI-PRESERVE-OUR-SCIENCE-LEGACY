These limitations may be based on strength, mobility, dexterity, cognitive ability, etc. and combinations thereof. Data collected in an isolated environment to determine, for example, maximal strength or maximal range of motion would indeed be adequate for establishing not-to-exceed type design limitations, however these restraints on the system may be excessive over what is basally needed. Resources may potentially be saved by having a technique to determine the minimum measurements a system must accommodate. This paper specifically deals with the creation of a novel methodology for establishing mobility requirements for a new generation of space suit design concepts. Historically, the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station vehicle and space hardware design requirements documents such as the Man-Systems Integration Standards and International Space Station Flight Crew Integration Standard explicitly stated that the designers should strive to provide the maximum joint range of motion capabilities exhibited by a minimally clothed human subject. In the course of developing the Human-Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR) for the new space exploration initiative (Constellation), an effort was made to redefine the mobility requirements in the interest of safety and cost. Systems designed for manned space exploration can receive compounded gains from simplified designs that are both initially less expensive to produce and lighter, thereby, cheaper to launch.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20080010879, "endDate": "2008-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "bf53c51418f3484aa3a292aa10c74279", "id": "ad072b65f3194e0d8677c8627ad60a80"}], "name": "2008 Summer Bioengineering Conference", "location": "Marco Island, FL", "id": "bf53c51418f3484aa3a292aa10c74279", "startDate": "2008-06-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080010879, "id": "95bda9aa7a494a4aa058723188a16d21", "publicationDate": "2008-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080010879.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080010879/downloads/20080010879.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080010879/downloads/20080010879.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080010879/downloads/20080010879.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
