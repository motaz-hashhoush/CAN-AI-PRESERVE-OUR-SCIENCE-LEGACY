Members of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and ESA's ESTEC staff have been appointed to leadership positions within the project and ultimate control of the project rests with the Joint Working Group consisting of two project managers and two project scientists, equally representing both organizations. Coordination of time scales and overall mission design is discussed, including launch cooperation, public relations, and funding of scientific investigations such as Ulysses. Practical difficulties of managing an international project are discussed such as differing documentation requirements and communication techniques, and assurance of equality on projects.", "title": "Ulysses - An ESA/NASA cooperative programme", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T12:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900065081, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Meeks, W."}, "organization": {"name": "JPL", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "af55a0a47e924092b4072a8d4f5a9126"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900065081, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Eaton, D."}, "organization": {"name": "ESTEC", "location": "Noordwijk, Netherlands"}}, "id": "9c454a26610542f0b217a2c61ab850cc"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900065081, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900065081, "issue": "63, A", "issn": "0376-4265", "id": "63f58f1d43a74253979585eeda5652ec", "publicationName": "ESA Bulletin", "publicationDate": "1990-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
