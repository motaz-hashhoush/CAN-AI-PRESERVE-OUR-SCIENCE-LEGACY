The purpose of the\nTechnology Reference Studies is to provide a focus for\nthe\ndevelopment\nof\nstrategically\nimportant\ntechnologies that are of likely relevance for future\nscientific missions. The aim of the Venus Entry Probe\nTRS is to study approaches for low cost in-situ\nexploration of Venus and other planetary bodies with a\nsignificant atmosphere. In this paper, the mission\nobjectives and an outline of the mission concept of the\nVenus Entry Probe TRS are presented.\n\n3.\n1.\n\nThe objective of the Venus Entry Probe Technology\nReference Study is to establish a feasible mission\nprofile for a low-cost in-situ exploration of the\natmosphere of Venus. An extensive literature survey\nhas been performed in order to identify a typical set of\nscientific objectives for such a mission. From this\nsurvey, the following set of key issues has been derived\n(with references to review articles):\n\nThe Venus Entry Probe is an ESA Technology\nReference Study (TRS) [1]. Technology reference\nstudies are model science-driven mission studies that\nare, although not part of the ESA science programme,\nable to provide a focus for future technology\nrequirements. This is accomplished through the study\nof several technologically demanding and scientifically\nmeaningful mission concepts, which have been\nstrategically chosen to address diverse technological\nissues.\n\n[SR1]\n\nOrigin and evolution of the atmosphere\n\nA major question is to understand why and how the\natmosphere has evolved so differently compared to\nEarth. This can only be investigated by in-situ\nmeasurements of the isotopic ratios of the noble gases\n[4, 5].\n\nKey technological objectives for future planetary\nexploration include the use of small orbiters and in-situ\nprobes with highly miniaturized and highly integrated\npayload suites. The low resource, and therefore low\ncost, spacecraft allow for a phased strategic approach\nto planetary exploration, thus reducing mission risks\ncompared to a single heavy resource mission.\n2.\n\nMISSION OBJECTIVES\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[SR2]\n\nVENUS EXPLORATION IN CONTEXT\n\nComposition and chemistry of the lower\natmosphere\n\nAccurate measurements of minor atmospheric\nconstituents, particularly water vapour, sulphur dioxide\nand other sulphur compounds, will improve our\nknowledge of the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus,\natmospheric chemical processes and atmospheresurface chemistry, and will address the issue of the\npossible existence of volcanism [4, 5].\n\nMore than twenty missions have been flown to Venus\nso far, including fly-bys, orbiters, and in-situ probes.\nThese past missions have provided a basic description\nof the planet, its atmosphere and ionosphere as well as\na complete mapping of the surface by radar. The\n\n201\n\n[SR3]\n\nthe Venus Entry Probe TRS:\n\nAtmospheric dynamics\n\n[MR1] In-situ scientific exploration at an altitude\nbetween 40 and 57 km at all longitudes by\nmeans of an aerobot [SR1-4].\n\nVenus has a very complicated atmospheric dynamical\nsystem. The driving force behind the zonal\nsupperrotation, the dynamics of the polar vortices and\nthe meridional circulation as well as the cause of\ntemporal and spatial variations of the cloud layer\nopacity are all rather poorly understood [4, 5, 6].\n[SR4]\n\n[MR2] Vertical profiles of a few physical properties\nof the lower atmosphere at varying locations\nacross the planet by means of atmospheric\nmicroprobes [SR3].\n\nAerosols in the cloud layers\n\n[MR3] Remote atmospheric sensing to provide a\nregional and global context of the in-situ\natmospheric measurements (also concurrent\nwith the aerobot operational phase) [SR2-4].\n\nMeasurements of the size distribution, temporal and\nspatial variability as well as the chemical composition\nof the cloud particles is of interest for better\nunderstanding the thermal balance as well as the\natmospheric chemistry [4]. Furthermore, it has been\nsuggested that the unidentified large (~ 7 \xc2\xb5m diameter)\ncloud particles might contain microbial life [7, 8].\n[SR5]\n\n[MR4] Remote sensing of the polar vortices with a\nlarge field of view and a repeat frequency less\nthan 5 hours [SR3].\n\nGeology and tectonics\n\n[MR5] Remote sensing of the Venus atmosphere at all\nlongitudes and latitudes [SR2-4].\n\nKey outstanding questions on the surface of Venus are\nthe mineralogy, the history of resurfacing as well as of\nvolcanism [5]. Resolving the global tectonic structure\nand (improved) topographical mapping will improve\nour understanding on these issues.\n\n[MR6] Remote sensing of the Venus surface by\nmeans of a ground penetrating radar and radar\naltimeter [SR5].\n\n4.\n\nMISSION DESIGN\n\n4.2\n\n4.1\n\nMission requirements\n\nThe mission concept that is able to fulfil all\nrequirements consists of a pair of small-sats and an\naerobot, which drops active ballast probes. A twosatellite configuration is required in order to commence\n\nIn order to address the science objectives, the\nfollowing mission requirements have been imposed on\n\nMission concept\n\nTable 1.

The Earth departure phase can be\noptimized by launching the Soyuz-Fregat into a highly\nelliptical Earth orbit, with the spacecraft providing the\ndelta-V for Earth escape [12].\n\nthe remote sensing atmospheric investigations prior to\nthe aerobot deployment (MR3).\nOne satellite will be in a polar Venus orbit. The Venus\nPolar Orbiter (VPO) contains a remote sensing payload\nsuite primarily dedicated to support the in-situ\natmospheric measurements by the aerobot and to\naddress the global atmospheric science objectives. The\nsecond satellite enters a highly elliptical orbit, deploys\nthe aerobot and subsequently operates as a data relay\nsatellite, while it also performs limited science\ninvestigations of the ionosphere and the surface (after\nlowering the apoapse).\n\nA standard high thrust heliocentric transfer from Earth\nto Venus is envisaged, because this is the most costefficient and flexible option for a mission to Venus.\nThe launch opportunities are primarily driven by the\nEarth-Venus synodic period of 1.6 years. The 3.4\xc2\xba\ninclination of Venus\xe2\x80\x99 orbit to ecliptic causes a variation\nin the Earth-Venus distance, so that the delta-V\nrequirements vary at successive optimum launch\nwindows.\n\nThe aerobot consists of a long-duration balloon, which\nwill analyse the scientifically interesting Venusian\nmiddle cloud layer. During flight, the balloon deploys a\nswarm of active ballast probes, which determine\nvertical profiles of pressure, temperature, flux levels\nand wind velocity in the lower atmosphere.\n\nThe typical transfer time for a half solar revolution\ntransfer is between 120 and 160 days, with a delta-V\nrequirement for Venus orbit insertion (250 km \xc3\x97\n66,000 km) typically less than 1.4 km/s [12].\nDepending on Earth departure strategy and planetary\ngeometry, a high-thrust chemical propulsion system\ncan typically bring into Venus orbit a spacecraft mass\nbetween 900 kg and 1150 kg.\n\nThe concept of a long-duration balloon with ballast\nprobes is not new and has been proposed before, see\ne.g. [9, 10, 11]. The focus of the Venus Entry Probe\nstudy is to identify the critical technologies associated\nwith such a concept with the aim to successfully\nsupport the technology development of a miniaturized\naerobot system with atmospheric microprobes.\n\nThe VPO and VEO spacecraft can travel as a\ncomposite or individually. As the composite\nconfiguration is more mass and cost-efficient (mission\noperations), this is currently selected as the baseline,\nwith the VEO providing the propellant for departure\nand Venus orbit insertion.\n\nTable 1 gives an overview of the mission baseline\nscenario, including a strawman payload suite. Because\natmospheric science investigations (large field of view\nand high polar revisit frequency, see MR4) and surface\nradar investigations (low periapse) pose different\nrequirements on the operational orbit, the Venus Polar\nOrbiter will carry the atmospheric remote sensing\ninstrumentation and the Venus Elliptical Orbiter the\nradar instrumentation. The tentative operational orbits\nfor both spacecraft are listed in Table 2.\n4.3\n\n4.4\n\nVenus Polar Orbiter spacecraft\n\nThe 3-axis stabilized Venus Polar Orbiter spacecraft is\nbased on a thrust tube structural concept, because of its\nlow mass and simplicity of design. The propulsion\nsystem consists of a conventional dual mode\nbipropellant system, using Hydrazine and Nitrogen\nTetroxide for high thrust manoeuvres and Hydrazine\nmonopropellant thrusters for low thrust.\n\nLaunch and transfer to Venus\n\nA Soyuz-Fregat 2-1B launch from Kourou has been\nselected as the baseline for the Venus Entry Probe TRS\nbecause it is a cost-efficient and highly reliable launch\nvehicle.

A mass budget of 30 kg (including\nmargins) has been allocated for the remote sensing\natmospheric science instruments (see Table 1). The\npayload instruments will be integrated into a highly\nintegrated payload suite. By merging individual\ninstruments onto one platform and sharing resources on\na system architecture level, considerable mass and\npower reductions can be achieved without sacrificing\nthe scientific performance. The science data obtained\nby the Venus Polar Orbiter will be relayed to the Venus\nElliptical Orbiter through an X-band link.\n4.5\n\nmass reduction are viable routes towards a lower\napoapse, and consequently a larger surface coverage. A\nmass of 20 kg has been reserved for a ground\npenetrating radar and a radar altimeter. Possibly a wide\nfield camera will be included as well.\n4.6\n\nEntry vehicle\n\nFig. 1 shows a conceptual drawing of the entry vehicle.\nThe aeroshell has a 45\xc2\xba sphere-cone geometry, which\nprovides a good packaging shape and aerodynamical\nstability. Most of the volume of the entry probe is\ntaken up by the spherical gas storage tank, which is\nsurrounded by the ring-shaped gondola. For storage of\nthe balloon inflation gas, a conventional gas tank has\nbeen baselined, though alternatives such as cold gas\ngenerators or chemical storage of hydrogen are being\nconsidered.\n\nVenus Elliptical Orbiter spacecraft\n\nTable 4 lists the top-level mass budget for the Venus\nElliptical Orbiter. For cost reduction purposes, the\ncommonality of platform and subsystems between the\nVPO and VEO will be exploited as much as possible.\nAs a consequence, the VEO spacecraft also uses a\nsimilar thrust tube concept and a dual mode propulsion\nsystem.\n\nIn Table 5 the tentative top-level mass budget for the\nVenus entry vehicle is summarized. Because the design\nstudy is still in an early phase, a 25% design maturity\nmargin has been added.\n\nThe Venus Elliptical Orbiter will stay in a highly\nelliptical orbit until deployment of the entry probe,\nwhich is initiated after the VPO has reached its final\norbit and the instrument calibration phase has been\ncompleted. During this first phase, the VEO primarily\nacts as a relay station to Earth for data from the VPO as\nwell as from the aerobot, possibly via the VPO. The\nKa-band has been selected for communications to\nEarth, whereas X-band communication is the baseline\nfor the inter-satellite communications.\n\n4.6.1\n\nProbe release\n\nThe entry probe will be released from the VEO\nspacecraft, while it is in a highly elliptical orbit with an\norbital period in excess of 24 hours. To keep the entry\nvehicle design simple, the VEO spacecraft will provide\nthe required velocity and orientation for the probe\nentry. After release of the probe, the spacecraft will\nperform a re-orbit burn.\n\nAfter the operational phase of the aerobot has ended,\nthe VEO will progress to its final low elliptical orbit\n(250 km \xc3\x97 7,500 \xe2\x80\x93 20,000 km) in order to start the\ndetailed (sub)surface radar investigations. The current\npreliminary mass budgets allow for an apoapse of\n20,000 km using chemical propulsion. Further work is\nin progress to assess whether aerobraking or spacecraft\n\nDeployment from orbit has been chosen as the baseline\nbecause direct entry from the interplanetary transfer\nhyperbola would require a complicated interplanetary\ntransfer trajectory or orbit insertion scenario in order to\nfulfil the requirement of starting the remote sensing\natmospheric science investigations with the VPO prior\nto aerobot deployment (MR3).\n\nTable 4.

Conceptual drawing of the entry probe.\n\n204\n\n4.6.2\n\nkm, the balloon will be deployed. The parachute and\nrear aeroshell are released and the inflation of the\nballoon is started. The parachute will be designed with\na small amount of glide to ensure lateral separation\nbetween the parachute and the balloon. The inflation\ntime of the balloon is a trade between the minimum\naltitude and the aerodynamic loads on the balloon.\nCurrently, an inflation duration of 20 seconds and a\nminimum altitude of 54 km is foreseen. The gas\nstorage system will be released after inflation of the\nballoon, and the aerobot will gradually rise to cruise\naltitude.\n\nEntry, descent and deployment\n\nThe probe will enter the dense Venus atmosphere with\na velocity of 9.8 km/s and a flight path angle between\n30\xcb\x9a and 40\xcb\x9a, as this scenario yields the best overall\nsystem mass. A steep entry angle will cause the probe\nto penetrate deep within the atmosphere quickly,\nleading to high accelerations and heat fluxes. However,\nsince the deceleration to subsonic velocities occurs\nvery quickly, the total absorbed heat is relatively low.\nAdditionally, the short entry duration enables a quick\nrelease of the aeroshell (~20 seconds), thus minimizing\nthe time for the absorbed heat to soak through the heat\nshield.\n\n4.6.3\n\nThe balloon will stabilize at an altitude of 55 km. At\nthis altitude all the scientific objectives outlined in\nsection 3 can be addressed, while the environment is\nrelatively benign (30 \xc2\xb0C and 0.5 bars [13]).\n\nThe heat shield material consists of Carbon-Phenolic,\nwhich is capable of withstanding very high heat fluxes\n(~ 300 MW/m2), much higher than the peak heat flux\nof ~20 MW/m2 for a 40\xcb\x9a entry angle. The maximum\nentry flight path angle is set by the 200 g acceleration\ncapability of the payload.\n\nThe goal for the aerobot operational mission duration is\nto travel at least twice around Venus. Taking the\naverage speed of 67.5 m/s from the VEGA balloons\nthat flew at a similar altitude [14], one obtains a\nminimum flight duration of 14 days.\n\nThe deployment sequence is depicted in figure 2. The\n45\xcb\x9a sphere-cone entry probe is designed to be stable in\nthe hypersonic and supersonic regimes, so that no\nactive control is required. Just above Mach 1.5, a diskgap-band or a ribbon parachute will be deployed by a\npyrotechnic mortar. The parachute stabilizes the probe\nas it decelerates through the transonic regime. The\nfront aeroshell will be released a few seconds after\nparachute deployment when the subsonic regime has\nbeen reached. To prevent heating from the back cover,\nthe rear aeroshell will be distanced from the aerobot by\na tether. At a velocity of ~20 m/s and altitude of ~55\n\nA light gas balloon with slight overpressure is\nconsidered the most suitable candidate for the Venus\naerobot, because such a balloon complies best with the\noperational requirements for a long duration mission.\nAs the gas leaks out of the super pressure balloon, the\nfloat altitude will increase until there is insufficient gas\nfor positive buoyancy (and the balloon sinks to the\nsurface). A carefully selected microprobe drop scenario\ncould partially compensate for the loss of balloon gas\nand thus maximize the operational lifetime. Gas release\nmechanisms and gas replenishment systems are also\nbeing considered in order to compensate for\n\nTable 5.

A schematic of the Venus aerobot deployment.\n\n205\n\nDuring the night, primary or secondary batteries will\nbe used.\n\ntemperature changes in the balloon gas due to gradients\nin solar radiation at the day/night and night/day\nterminators.\n\nCurrently, Lithium-thionylchloride primary batteries\nhave been selected as the baseline, as this is the most\nmass-efficient solution due to their high energy density\n(~590 Wh/kg). The important drawback of soluble\ncathode lithium cells is that they are less safe than the\nmore common solid electrolyte Lithium cells. As an\nalternative, Li-polymer secondary batteries are\nconsidered which can be recharged during the day. As\nthe energy density is significantly lower (~170 Wh/kg),\nthe mass penalty for using rechargeable batteries is\nabout 4 kg.\n\nHydrogen has been selected as the baseline for the\nballoon inflation gas, with helium as a backup option.\nThough the mass of gas storage systems for hydrogen\nand helium are similar, the main advantage of\nhydrogen is that it generally has a lower gas leakage\nrate compared to helium, which is a monatomic gas.\nThe main disadvantage of using hydrogen is its\nhazardousness.\nThe balloon envelope material should have an\nextremely low leakage rate, possibly requiring welded\nseams. Additionally, the deployment will have to be\ncarried out in a controlled manner to avoid the slightest\ndamage to the envelope.\n4.6.4\n\nIn order to save mass, the payload and communication\nduty cycles will be substantially lower during the night,\nresulting in an average night-time power consumption\nof 5 W, compared to 11 W during the day.\n\nGondola\n4.6.5\n\nFigure 3 shows a conceptual drawing of the gondola\nlayout. A strawman payload suite has been defined,\nwhich can fulfil the mission objectives. It consists of a\ngas chromatograph/gas spectrometer (with aerosol\ninlet), a nephelometer, solar and IR flux radiometers, a\nmeteorological package, a radar altimeter and the\natmospheric microprobe system. An assessment study\nis currently in progress to integrate all instruments,\nexcept the atmospheric microprobe system, into two\nhighly integrated payload suites with a total mass of 4\nkg and an average power consumption of 5 W.\n\nThe fifteen atmospheric microprobes on board of the\naerobot serve a twofold purpose:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNephelometer GCMS\n\nPower\nElectronics\n\nDPU\n\nAerosol Analysis\nPackage\nMicroprobe\ncomms and\nlocalization\n\nIn order to investigate both the local weather patterns\non Venus as well the global atmospheric dynamics, the\n15 microprobes will be dropped in 5 separate drop\ncampaigns, spaced equally over the mission lifetime.\nThe three probes in a drop campaign will be released\nwith an interval of 5 minutes.\n\n\xe2\x88\x85524mm\n\nRadar\nAltimeter\n\nOverall\ngondola\nshape\n\nSolar/IR Flux\nRadiometer\nRotatable\nExtension Shaft\n\nTransponder\n\nPerform scientific meaningful measurements\nDrop ballast in order to increase the\noperational lifetime of the aerobot\n\nThe atmospheric microprobes measure in-situ vertical\nprofiles of selected properties of the lower atmosphere\nfrom the aerobot float altitude down to at least 10 km\naltitude. Due to the stringent mass limitations of the\naerobot, they should be as low-weight as possible. This\nlimits the choice of sensors that can be carried with the\nmicroprobes. Currently, the following measurements\nare foreseen: pressure, temperature, and solar flux\nlevels. The horizontal wind velocity will be deduced\nfrom the trajectory of the microprobes. This set of\nmeasurements, performed at different longitudes, will\nprovide new insights in the atmospheric dynamics and\nthe heat balance on Venus (see MR2).\n\nElectrical power will be provided by amorphoussilicon solar cells, which are mounted on the gondola\nsurfaces, yielding sufficient power during the day.\nMeteorological\nPackage\nInertial\nPackage\n\nAtmospheric microprobes\n\nVolume for\nbattery\n3 sets of 5 microprobes\n\nLocalization and communication of the small\nmicroprobes is a challenging task and is therefore\nsubject of a separate technology development activity\n[15].
