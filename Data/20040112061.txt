Pinatubo, Philippines\xe2\x80\x9d\n1. Introduction\nOur project focused on the investigation of the post-eruption hazards at Mt.\nPinatubo (Philippines) using remote sensing data, and field observations of the 1991\neruption deposits. Through the use of multiple satellite images, field work, and the\n1996/2000 PacRim data sets, we conducted studies of the co- and post-eruption hazards\nof the volcano due to erosion and re-deposition of the extensive pyroclastic flow deposits.\nDuring our project, volcanic hazards continue to persist at Mt. Pinatubo, more than\na decade after the 1991 climactic eruption. Most obvious of these hazards are those\ninvolving the re-deposition of pyroclastic flow and fall deposits as lahars, deposit-derived\npyroclastic flows and phreatic ash fallout. Many of these processes go unobserved when\nthey occur in river valleys that have been inaccessible for several years after the eruption.\nIn particular, these events occur in volumetric magnitudes, and at temporal frequencies,\nthat make it difficult to identify in the field all of the changes that take place in many of\nthe more remote pyroclastic deposits on the volcano.\nA major part of this project was the assembly and analysis of a database of over 50\nhigh resolution (1 - 50 dpixel) images that will facilitate this study. We collected\nIkonos, SPOT, SIR-CK-SAR, Landsat, ERS, RADARSAT, and ASTER images of the\narea around Mt. Pinatubo. An example of the changes that could be seen in these data is\nshown in Figure 1. Our investigation focused on a retrospective analysis of the erosion,\nredeposition, and re-vegetation of the 1991 pyroclastic flow deposits of Mt. Pinatubo.\nThe primary geologic goal of our work was the analysis of the spatial distribution and\nvolume change of the sources and sinks of materials associated with mudflow (\xe2\x80\x9clahar\xe2\x80\x9d)\nevents. This included the measurement of river valley gradients and cross-sections using\nTOPSAR digital elevation data, as we are participating in the PacRim 2000 deployment\nto the Philippines specifically so that we can collect a second set of TOPSAR data that\ncan then be used to create a topographic difference image of the volcano. The main\nresults from this multi-sensor study have been published as Torres et al. (2004). A\ndiscussion of the methodology that we used to assemble an appropriate database was\nincluded in Mouginis-Mark and Domergue-Schmidt (2000).\nAs part of an educational outreach effort, we also helped the Philippine Institute of\nVolcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) in the Philippines to use NASA data to study\nMt. Pinatubo and other Filipino volcanoes. To help them, we conducted preliminary\nstudies of other Filipino volcanoes, including Taal and Mayon. Ronnie Torres, who was\ninitially a graduate student, and then a post-doc, supported under this grant, has been in\nthe Philippines for almost the entire 12-month period. He has been working at\nPHIVOLCS, and has served a crucial point of contact between our NASA investigation\nand the on-going needs of local Filipino volcanologists.\n\n2. Results\n2.1 Volcanolow: Since the end of detailed field observations at Mt. Pinatubo in\n1995, no field-based intensive monitoring and mapping efforts have been conducted and\nprojections of lahar volume per year have been based on model predictions. Thus our\n\nFinal Report: NAG5-7578\n\nPage 2\n\nremote sensing observations have served as a valuable temporal extension of the field\ndata (Torres et al., 2004). For the first half of our decade of coverage, there was ample\nground truth, but in the last five years (1996 - 2001) the remote sensing data provide\nunique insights into surface processes and the engineering intervention in Pasig-Potrero\nalluvial fan. We used SPOT data to map the extent of lahar deposits acquired in\nDecember 1991, which represents up to that point the accumulated deposit during that\nyear\'s rainy season. We noted that the thickness of the 1991 lahar succession would not\nexceed 5 m since the deposit did not completely cover the 5-7 m high dike structure.\nMost of the thicker and drier portion of the fan corresponds to pixels with high DN values\n(i.e., bright pixels). These are clustered near the deeply entrenched active channel or\nhave elongated distribution that suggests the features are artifacts of abandoned channels.\nThe low DN regions were characterized in the field by a muddy marshland or areas with\nveneer of lahar deposits. We assigned thicknesses of <1 m for lahar deposits in these\nregions. Using 20 x 20 m pixel dimension (i.e., spatial resolution of SPOT images), we\nestimated a total area of 44.6 x lo6 m2 and a total volume of 49 x lo6 m3 from the\nassumed isopach thicknesses.\n\nFigure 1: Segments of four SPOT scenes for the NW flank of Mt. Pinatubo, obtained December 18, 1991\n(top left), December 1 1,1994 (top right), February 12", 1996 (bottom left) and December 5\'h, 1998 (bottom\nright). The summit caldera of the volcano is at bottom right in each image.\n\nFinal Report: NAG5-7578\n\nPage 3\n\nAnalysis of sequential ERS scenes enables the progression of engineering\nintervention to be monitored by multi-temporal ERS- 1 data acquisition from mid-1 993 to\nearly 1998. Large lahar events in 1994 and 1995 gave convincing proof of the\ninadequacy of earlier dike designs to control lahars and had shown that the brunt of lahar\nmitigation lies primarily in the depositional rather than fluid transport and erosional\nhazards of lahars. The major changes in the scale of engineering intervention at PasigPotrero kept abreast with the magnitude of lahar hazards and culminated with the\ncompletion of the outer dike system in 1996. The top of the dike structure stands\nbetween 5 to 15 meters high from the base and shows prominently in the radar scenes.\nBased on the map of Pasig-Potrero produced by the Philippine Department of Public\nWorks and Highways, the outer dike (locally called the Mega-dike) was conceived as a\nmulti-stage sediment catchment area, which was designed to hold about 200 x lo6 m3\nbulk sediment volume. The outer dike system encloses most of Bacolor, a portion of\nStation Rita, and large part of Porac. Its eastern alignment nearly follows the municipal\nboundary of Bacolor and San Fernando, while the western alignment extends along the\nGuagua-Bacolor and Station Rita-Bacolor boundary. Transverse dikes and the elevated\nGapan-Olongapo Highway were constructed across the general flow direction so as to\ntrigger deposition and store the sediments, while allowing the muddy streamflows to exit\nthrough spillways. Concrete armoring of the outer dike rendered the structure more\nresilient and gave it a more pronounced definition in the May 1996 ERS scene compared\nto that of the April 1995 scene.\nThe changes in the distribution of the lahar deposits on the alluvial fan between\nR\ndifferent acquisition times were quite pronounced in the visible and near I wavelengths\nof the SPOT, LANDSAT and ASTER data sets. The surface of lahar deposits that were\nnot overgrown with vegetation cannot be mapped with the visible bands of the above\nsatellite data sets, but will not provide an indication of the sequential deposition. For\ninstance, old and new lahar deposits exhibited similar image characteristics in the\nabsence of some other factors, such as vegetation, water saturation, distribution pattern,\nor proximity to the active channel. The inability of the visible bands to unequivocally\ndiscriminate young and old deposits can be seen in the map of the alluvial fan using the\nFebruary 1996 SPOT scene as compared to the field-derived map of the alluvial fan in\n1995. Moreover, these indicators are not unequivocal since vegetation flourish much\nfaster on thin lahar deposits than thicker ones (rooting to sub lahar soils is easier). As\nsuch, the vegetation-covered surface may not be included in the area and volume\nestimates of the alluvial fan, yet its correlative near-channel facies and the older thicker\ndeposits may be lumped together in deposit mapping. Although we were unable to\ndistinguish young lahar deposits from older ones using visible wavelengths, we were able\nto employ some assumptions to assign thickness of lahar deposits at several locations and\nestimate the cumulative volume.\nThe 1996 El Niiio phenomenon brought widespread drought to the region, and thus a\nremarkable drop in the frequency and magnitude of lahar events occurred at Pinatubo.\nAs such, the ERS scene taken in September 1996 showed the alluvial fan is almost the\nsame, i.e., entirely the product of the 1995 lahar deposition. There was no indication of\nnew areas encroached outside the extent of the 1995 alluvial fan, while in the 1996 scene\nthe fan loses contrast with surrounding areas as vegetation starts to colonize its margins.\nA normal wet season returned in 1997, but lahar generation did not exceed the intensity\n\nFinal Report: NAG5-7578\n\nPage 4\n\nof the previous years and appeared to be on the decline. Lahar deposits were mostly\nconfined within the catchment basin enclosed by the outer dike and the 3-km-long\ntransverse dike. The RADARSAT scene acquired in December 1997 shows the extent of\nrenewed lahar deposition and the configuration of the active channel during the 1997\nrainy season. In succeeding years, lahar generation declined as there were very few lahar\nevents and very little new lahar deposits that were being added on the Pasig-Potrero\nalluvial fan. The SPOT, LANDSAT and ASTER images still showed a large area of the\ndepositional basin that were covered with pre- 1996 lahar deposits.\nLahar events fiom 1998 to 2001 seasons were mostly channel-confined and the\noverall channel configuration of the Pasig-Potrero River system did not change\ndramatically from 1997. Figure 2 shows a summary of our image-derived map of lahar\ndeposits during the ten-year remote sensing observation period which extended up until\nan ASTER acquisition in November 1, 2001. Evidently, the chronological sequence of\ndeposition that was derived from multi-temporal remote sensing monitoring of the\nalluvial fan evolution provides important clues for the interpretation of more recent data\nsets.\n\nDcc 1997\n\nSPOT\nDec 1998\n\nLANDSAT\n\noct 1999\n\n\'\n\nLANDSAT\n\noct2uM\n\n\'\n\nNov 2001\n\nFigure 2: Outlines of each successive new lahar deposit along the lower part of the Pasig-Potrero River, as\ninferred fiom our satellite observation.\n\n2.2 Field Work Our NASA-funded field trip to Mt. Pinatubo was conducted November\n16* - 28* 1999 (note that we made two other trips to Mt. Pinatubo under separate\nfunding to J. Bailey and S. Self). You can see a selection of the field sites that we visited\nby looking at our web site (htto://w.him.hawaii.edu/-~mm/Pinatubo.htd). The\n\nFinal Report: NAG5-7578\n\nPage 5\n\nprimary objective of this trip was to establish baseline data for the degree of dissection of\nthe Marella and Mauraunot Rivers (see Figure 3 for the striking changes that took place\nover the last decade). We used laser ranging devices as well as more conventional\nphotography and surveying equipment to measure valley width, depth and slope. GPS\ncontrol points were obtained so that we can locate these positions on high-resolution\nsatellite images (e.g., Ikonos or QuickBird 1). Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain\nthe appropriate data from the Space Imaging Corporation to see vertical cliffs.\n\nFigure 3: An example in Marella Valley (a drainage channel to SW of Mt. Pinatubo) of the volumes and\npatterns of erosion over time from before, to just after, to 3 years later to present day. The distinctive\n\xe2\x80\x9cbump\xe2\x80\x9d outlined in each photograph identifies the same location (1991 and 1994 photographs from\nPunongbayan et al., 1996).\n\n2.3 Interactions with PHIVOLCS: Mainly through the efforts of Ronnie Torres, we\ncarried out a significant amount of work with PHIVOLCS in Manila as part of an\noutreach effort that was encouraged by Eamie Paylor at NASA Headquarters. This\nincluded collaboration on the identification of new flight lines for the PacRim 2\ndeployment, in which Pete Mouginis-Mark was also involved. During our field trip in\n1999, we gave several talks at PHIVOLCS on the uses of remote sensing data for the\nanalysis of volcanoes in the Philippines. We also studied the area to the south and west\nof Manila and north of Lake Taal. This area is prone to large earthquakes, and there is\nconcern that not all of the fault lines have been identified on the ground (due to heavy\nvegetation cover and steep slopes). Thus we were better able to define the TOPSAR\n\nFinal Report: NAG5-7578\n\nPage 6\n\nflight lines. We have continued working with investigators at PHNOLCS up until the\npresent time (summer 2004) on a variety of Pinatubo-related, as well as general remote\nsensing, topics as can be seen from the numerous abstracts that we have jointly published\nwith them (Torres et al., 1999,2001,2002, and 2004).\n2.4 Students: We had two graduate students working on this grant. Ronnie Torres was\nsupported fiom March 1999 until he gained his PhD in 2001. Ronnie focused on the\nevolution of the lahar deposits on the SE flank of Pinatubo, and continued this study of\nPinatubo as a postdoc on this grant after he graduated. Ronnie also worked at\nPHIVOLCS, and has had a strong interest in helping them gain more experience in\nremote sensing techniques in order to enhance the local remote sensing capabilities. We\nalso supported Mr. John Bailey, who concentrated on the analysis of the down-stream\nerosion of the pyroclastic deposits produced by the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruptions. John\nreceived his Masters degree in 2001, and then continued his studies (under a NASA\nGlobal Change Fellowship). John subsequently continued some work on Mt. Pinatubo as\npart of his Ph.D. degree, which he defended in May 2004.\n2.5: Suvvort ofPacRim 2000 Devlovment\nUnder this h d i n g , we also played a major role in the design and implementation of\nthe NASA DC-8 aircraft for the PacRirn 2000 deployment to Hawaii, the Philippines, and\nseveral islands in the S.W. Pacific. In addition to our primary volcano targets, we\nexplored the potential of the TOPSAR data to provide insight into the structure and\neruptive history of the island of Savai\'i, Samoa (13"20\'S, 171O30\'E). To this end, we\nassembled a mosaic of the nine TOPSAR swaths covers 1,538 km2 (89%) of the island,\nincluding the main east-west rift zone and the most recent (1905 - 1911) lava flow field.\nThe derived digital elevation model (gridded at 4.75 m spacing) enabled numerous\nfeatures of volcanological interest on and around this basaltic shield volcano to be\nstudied. We developed a slope map of Savai\'i and investigated the distribution of cinder\ncones, listing their relevant parameters (height, basal elevation, etc.). A TOPSARderived shaded relief image w s used in conjunction with the lower-resolution (15\na\nmeter/pixel) ETM+ panchromatic band to map lava flow fields and volcanic deposits,\nthereby permitting the identification of lava channels and the extent of individual lava\nflows. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, calculated fiom Landsat\'s red and\nnear-infrared wavelength bands, yielded information about vegetation patterns on other\nrecently erupted flows. These remote-sensing data were of value for mapping the\neruptive characteristics of this infrequently studied volcanic island, and could serve as a\nbasis for hazard mitigation planning. Some details of the challenges involved in\nmosaicking multiple TOPSAR swaths were also explored.\nResults fiom this\ninvestigation were presented at the Spring 2002 meeting of the American Geophysical\nUnion (Kallianpur and Mouginis-Mark, 2002).\n\n3.

Future Implications of Satellite Remote Sensing at Mt. Pinatubo and Elsewhere\nAround the World\nWe have been able to use our experience from this project to identify strategies for\nmonitoring other explosive volcanoes (e.g., Mouginis-Mark, 2001). Extensive field\nmonitoring of the lahar flow events, and the subsequent mapping of the deposits were\nonly conducted during the height of the lahar crisis in the first few years aRer the\n\nFinal Report: NAG5-7578\n\nPage 8\n\nPinatubo eruption up until the end of 1995. The field-monitored parameters included\nsediment concentration, flow duration, peak discharge, area of deposition, channel\ndegradation and thickness of deposits. These parameters yielded important variables in\nanalysis of channel evolution, lahar generation, and direction of alluvial fan\nencroachment, which were utilized for disaster mitigation. However, this exercise\nrequired huge manpower and resources and involved the manning of several field stations\nalong active channels and tributaries and the coverage of the entire fan area. As the\nmanpower committed to lahar monitoring and observation dwindled to a smaller team in\nmid-1990s due to other pressing concerns (e.g., the 1993 Mayon eruption and 1994\nMindoro Earthquake), we found that monitoring the same critical areas using remote\nsensing data is an effective way to extend the time series observations and provide the\ninformation needed for hazard assessment and risk analysis. Indeed, some of the field\nobjectives can be more thoroughly covered by properly exploiting the information from\nremote sensing data. For instance, the depositional area of recent lahar deposits can be\ndetermined by image analysis of high-resolution remote sensing data set in a shorter time\nthan it takes to map the deposit in the field.\nOur ten-year remote sensing analysis of the Pasig-Potrero alluvial fan (Torres et al.,\n2004) revealed the progressive encroachment of lahar deposit and the changing pattern of\nlahar conveyance system. Although the distribution of lahar deposits may have been\nconstrained at some portions by the construction of the dike system, the sequential\nimages also show that the design and alignment of the dike system had evolved with the\nspatial and temporal changes in lahar deposition. Thickness of the deposits may be\ngleaned, albeit subtly, from the disappearance of known man-made structures and\ntopographic features. Apparently, the evolution of the lahar deposit fan is a predictable\nresponse of the Pasig-Potrero alluvial fan to a parallel landscape changes in the source\nregion. The major geomorphic event of October 5, 1993, when the upstream watershed\nof the Sacobia River was routed into the Pasig-Potrero drainage system, was reflected in\nthe dramatic increase in lahar deposition on the Pasig-Potrero that peaked during the\n1995 lahar season.\nQualitatively, the rate of lahar deposition has been rapidly decreasing since the 1995.\nWe observed from sequential remote sensing images that the active channel in the PasigPotrero alluvial fan maintained the same drainage pattern that was established in 1995.\nAt similar condition of dynamic equilibrium has also been observed in 1995 in the\nMarella and Bucao drainage systems on the west side of Pinatubo (Bailey et al., 2001).\nMoreover, the downstream channel of the Pasig-Potrero has become wider and more\nentrenched with better-defmed meander loops at the end of the 1998 rainy season,\nsuggesting that a near steady-state condition has already been attained earlier. To date,\nthe Pasig-Potrero River conveys muddy stream flows on to the alluvial fan, while its\nupstream portion has already been cutting into the pre-emption lahar and pyroclastic flow\ndeposits below the 1991 ignimbrite sections.\nRadar data were important in our study because of their ability to provide information\nat any given weather and time of the day. Although radar was useful for studying the\nlarge-scale changes in the Pasig-Potrero alluvial fan, we recognized some limitations in\nthe application of these data to hazard mapping. For instance, the tonal contrast on the\nPasig-Potrero alluvial fan has decreased as shown in the series of ERS radar scenes taken\nduring the 1996 dry season (see also Chorowicz et al. (1997) for a comparison of two\n\nFinal Report: NAG5-7578\n\nPage 9\n\nERS radar scenes of lahars). During this period, no major lahar events were expected to\nhave resurfaced the fan so that the radar backscatter of the fan is either controlled by the\nwater content of the surface layers (making the surface dark) or by the increasing\ncolonization and growth of vegetation. By early 1996, the alluvial fan exhibits an overall\ndark tonal quality, but lost tonal contrast along the margins and on the downstream side\nof the transverse dike. The poor contrast with surrounding areas suggested that\nvegetation growth had started to affect these areas, albeit the rest of the fan remained\nwater saturated. Under tropical conditions, coarse grass and wild cane spread rapidly on\nlahar deposits. Vegetation growth increases surface roughness and moisture retention,\nthereby increasing the backscatter potential of the targeted land surface. Since cultivated\ncrops such as rice, corn and sugarcane, and wild vegetation in the surrounding areas, are\nof similar plant morphology, re-vegetation of the alluvial fans resulted in similar\nbackscatter response between lahar and non-lahar surfaces. The deterioration of tonal\ncontrast is even more remarkable in the 1996 data, which normally is one of the wettest\nmonths of the year in this region. However, the 1996 rainy season had far less rainfall\ndue to the prevailing drought. Therefore, the radar backscatter characteristics of the\nalluvial fan suggest a surface that has not had significant resurfacing by lahar and been\nsubstantially modified by the vegetation. Some improvements in the tonal contrast in\nlater scenes were artifacts of the construction of outer dike alignments and maintenance\nof inner dike segments, which redefined the boundaries of the alluvial fan.\nThe radar data were particularly useful in monitoring the evolution of the dike\nsystem, as well as the distribution of human settlements. During the 1991 to 1994 period,\nwe observed the strategy of engineering intervention at Pasig-Potrero alluvial fan was to\ncontain the lahar delivery along the pre-eruption drainage course and confine the bulk of\nfan aggradation within the inner dike system. The sequential ERS data acquisition had\nshown that the engineering strategy evolved into a mammoth dike system between 1994\nto 1996, not in anticipation of larger lahars but because the lahars have already broken\nout of the inner dikes and encroached into densely populated settlements. All of the\nsegments of outer dike system had been completed by the end of 1996. Although most\ndike structures are recognizable in the radar scene, some structures are more conspicuous\nbecause of their large size and the fact that they are armored with concrete. A\ncomparison of the field and remote sensing data showed that we missed some segments\nin the ERS scene since the same materials that are found in the alluvial fan were used to\ncover the unarmored dikes. In other cases, the dikes were partially eroded or nearly\nburied by previous lahar events that radar spatial resolution was unable to resolve their\na\nfeatures. Radar lookdirection, which w s constant in our study, may also have been\nimportant as it was easiest to identify dike segments oriented perpendicular to the radar\nlook-direction.\nWe also recognize that the single wavelengtWpolarization radar systems such as ERS\nand RADARSAT are not ideal for this type of mapping even before the potential high\ncommercial cost of these data is considered. A comparison between ERS and SIR-C\nSAR scenes that were both obtained in April 1994 shows the lahar deposit that is barely\ndistinguishable in the ERS scene, which suggested that the SIR-C radar can also\ndistinguish recent lahars from old lahar deposits. Evidently, the SIR-C scene shows the\nlahar deposits that accumulated mostly during the previous 1993 rainy season as it\nsignificantly differ with the alluvial fan that was observed in November 1991 SPOT\n\nFinal Report: NAG5-7578\n\nPage 10\n\nimage. Much of the improvement in tonal contrast between the alluvial fan and\nsurrounding areas was probably attributed to SIR-C system\xe2\x80\x99s ability to acquire data in the\nmulti-wavelength and multi-polarized modes. The enhanced contrast can also be\nobserved, albeit more subtly, between old and new lahar deposits. Figure 4 shows a\ncomparison between ERS data and SIR-C data that were collected within 9 days of each\nother, highlighting the difficulty in using single wavelengthkingle polarization data for\nstudying lahars at Pinatubo. Neutral gray tone defines the regions in the image difference\nwhere zero and near-zero DN values are clustered.\n\nFigure 4: Comparison of ERS scene (0\nESA 1994) acquired on April 23, 1994 (left) and SIR-C scene\nacquired on April 14, 1994 (right). ERS imaged the surface using C-band (wavelength 5.6 cm) with\nvertical transmit and receive polarization, while the SIR-C image was generated using C-band horizontal\ntransmit and receive, C-band horizontal transmit-vertical receive, and L-band horizontal transmit-vertical\nreceive. The extent of lahar deposits is barely recognizable in ERS scene as it blends with the surrounding\narea. Lahar deposits are more readily mappable in the SIR-C scene which employs C and L bands and\ncross-polarization of transmitted radar and backscatter signals. Unfortunately, we only had two time\nperiods (April and October 1994) when such multi-parameter radar data were available, and so we could\nnot use this data type for the majority of our investigations.\n\nIt is also important to note some remote sensing techniques that were not appropriate\nfor the analysis of Pinatubo. Much progress has been made in the analysis of volcano\ndeformation and surface change via radar interferometry techniques using both ERS and\nRADARSAT (Massonnet et al., 1995; Lu et al., 1997; Amelung et al., 2000). However,\nthese spacecraft have site revisit intervals of 24 and 35 days, respectively, and we have\nfound that atmospheric water vapor andor changes in the distribution of surface\nscatterers (e.g., wind moving the leaves on vegetation) precludes the construction of\nacceptable radar interferograms. This means that we are unable to develop DEMs over\nthe period of radar observations, so that it has not been possible to calculate the rate of\nchange of lahar volume over time. Although radar coherence maps have been used to\ndetect changes on Kilauea volcano (Zebker et al., 1996), the formation of new lahar\n\nFinal Report: NAG5-7578\n\nPage 11\n\ndeposits is most clearly seen in optical data such as SPOT and Landsat 7, so that there is\nless need to study radar interferograms for the small areas of Pinatubo where coherence is\nhigh. Potentially, the use of time-series DEMs from the TOPSAR system could also be\nused to study the changing volume of the Pinatubo lahars. Rowland et al. (1999) used\nTOPSAR and a second high resolution DEM for Kilauea volcano to estimate the rate of\nlava emplacement over a decade of activity of the volcano. Although two DEMs have\nbeen collected of Pinatubo by TOPSAR, in 1996 and 2000, we have found that the\nvertical accuracy of the TOPSAR system (-2 m) is insufficient to confidently map\nchanges in thickness of the lahars in the lower Pasig-Potrero system. Moreover,\nTOPSAR data acquisition on steep terrain are usually affected by large number of data\ndropouts and radar \xe2\x80\x9cshadows\xe2\x80\x9d that prevent the wholesale volume estimates by DEM\ndifference method. Targeted inspection of the \xe2\x80\x9ccleaner\xe2\x80\x9d TOPSAR data indicated that\nchanges in topography can be detected upslope where significant topographic changes in\nthe ignimbrite are taking place.\nFinally, we recognize the value in starting the collection of targeted high-resolution\nremote sensing data as soon after the eruption as is possible, which has implications for\nmonitoring future eruptions. Thus our work has been of great value in developing a\nstrategy for studying other explosive volcanoes around the world when they start to\nbecome active. When cloud-free conditions permit, the acquisition of LANDSAT 7 or\nASTER data should be a high priority. To extend this coverage throughout the year,\nmulti-polarization radar data for ENVISAT would be expected to be of greater value\nprovided that the viewing geometry is held constant. In this way, we believe that satellite\nremote sensing will provide important additional information relevant to hazard\nmitigation in a timely manner and will augment field observations in areas where\npersonal safety andor cost are important.\n5.
