However, shallower trajectories are not ideal for\ncommunications. Further concept development is required to achieve a closed Neptune design.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Based on stagnation point heating, simplified sizing was performed. Carbon Phenolic (CP) is twice as heavy compared to HEEET.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Feasible mission design has to protect the probe and\nsimultaneously allow sufficient time for communications\n\xe2\x80\xa2 We have a feasible design for Uranus entry. However,\nNeptune studies are incomplete and further work is needed to\nclose the design\n\xe2\x80\xa2 While CP has flown at extreme conditions, heritage CP is no\nlonger available. HEEET, a more efficient TPS is under\ndevelopment. It is anticipated that we will have extended\nperformance envelope for HEEET in the next decade\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Design trades for EFPA, need to be performed early in the study\nto ensure proper communication and viable entry solution from\nTPS perspective\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The peak heating environments likely to change with higher\nfidelity CFD analysis. It is recommended as part of the next phase\nof the study\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Current ground test facility does not encompass relevant (H2/He)\ntesting. Investment in ground test capability at flight relevant\nconditions is recommended as part of future development\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: We acknowledge the support of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Science Mission Directorate and Jet Propulsion Laboratory for funding this study.\n\n'
