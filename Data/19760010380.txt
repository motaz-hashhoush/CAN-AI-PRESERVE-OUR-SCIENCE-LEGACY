It is\na continuation of the Semi-Annual Progress Report, dated, March 1, 1975,\nwhich covered the period June 1, 1973 to May 31, 1974 and emphasized\nwork in the later part of this period. It has not been possible to report\nseparately and coherently on work accomplished in parts of this reporting\nperiod so the report should. be considered as a unit-account for the full\n1974-1975 grant year.\n\n2\n\nA C K N O W L E D G E M E N T S\nThe investigations described in this report were made possible by the\nfinancial support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nthrough the Office of University Affairs, under NASA Grant Number NGL 23004-083. Joseph A. Vitale, Chief, Engineering Design Branch, Office of\nUniversity Affairs, served as the Technical Officer.\nThe Michigan State University investigative team consisted of the following\nmembers:\nFaculty Investigators:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Myles Boylan (Principal Investigator), Professor, School of Urban\nPlanning and Landscape Architecture.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Raymond D.

Ac\'--ion programs are required for remedying accumulated\nabuses and mismanagements; for preserving and conserving the environmental resource qualities remaining. Effective programs can only be formulated by a\nbroad community of scientific disciplines and by the energies and actions of\nmany public and private institutions. A prerequisite to the formulation and\nacceptance of any effective action program is the ready availability of accurate\nand timely information for the formulation of policies which can be quickly\ntranslated into combinations of short-term and long-range remedial and preventative programs. Remote sensing is now becoming recognized and acknowledged\nas a major technological means for providing this kind of information. This\nProject has played a major role in bringing this change about in Michigan.\nThe original proposal submitted in 1971 to the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration for financial support in research of uses of remote sensing\nimagery was based on a general objective of exploring and evaluating the capability and reliability of all kinds of imagery for improving decision making\non issues of land use at all scales of governmental administration.\nThis original objective has continued to remain as the central focus of\nthe investigators\' endeavors, even though the operational emphases have been\npredominantly on applications to solving immediate problems confronting public\nagencies and private organizations.\nThe collective activities have resulted in widespread application of\nremote sensing use by public agencies, public organization.., , and related\nprivate corporations. They have fostered a new level of demand for imagery\nand technical or interpretative skills required to effect their use. In\naddition, they have developed in Michigan State University a new capability\nwhich, when joined with the problems-research and extension education of "Land\nGrant" policies and programs, can multiply on-land impacts throughout the State.\n\nF\t --i\n\n4\n\nThe following presentation describes in summary fashion the principal\nactivities engaged during the June 1, 1974 to May 31, 1975 grant year. For\nreporting purposes, this array of activities has been grouped under four\nbroad headings, namely (A) application activities; (B) research activities;\n(C) service activities; and (D) contract activities.\n\na.\n\nPR MW\nO\n\n5\n\nA. A P P L I C A T I O N A C T I V I T I E S\n\nE\t\n\nSynopsis: This section reports on applications which produced methodologies for selected natural resource situations that have, in turn, produced\nderivations of information and/or recommendations for remedial, or preventative\nactions. The applications during this reporting period were mainly concerned\nwith local implementation of Michigan legislation and land-use programs.\nSome of these applications demanded considerable Project input initially;\n\t\n\nthen, when rendered operational, were gradually transferred to appropriate\n\t\n\nagencies for continuing the applications or escalating them to advanced stages\n\n1\nt\n\n\' which would lead to ultimate actions. Others are expected to return to command\nProject attention from time to time when new information might be determinable\nor when decisio^.s will need to be made.\n\nW\n\n6\n\nAl. Michigan Land Cover/Use Classification System and Operational Testing\nOffice of Land Use\nDepartment of Natural Resources\nSteven T. Mason Bldg.\nLansing, Michigan 48926\n\nWest Michigan Regional Planning\nCommission (WMPC)\n1204 People\'s Building\nMonroe at Ionia\nGrand Rapids, Michigan 49502\n\nAs previously reported the MSU Remote Sensing Project was involved with\nthe Office of Land Use (OLU) within the Department of Natural Resources, and\nthe Westera Michigan Regional Planning Commission in extensive testing of a\nworking draft of a land cover/use classification system for the State of\nMichigan prepared by the Classification and Referencing Advisory Committee.\nThe findings of the combined field test and review activities resulted in the\nrecommendation of certain changes to the system. Several categories were\ndropped and others sharpened. These changes were incorporated in a widely\ndistributed draft of\'the classification scheme, which was subsequently\npublished by the OLU, without further modification, in July 1975.\n\nr\n\n\xe2\x96\xba2. Implementation of the Michigan Farmland and Open Space Preservation Act\nWayne County Planning Commission (WCPC)\n730 City-County Building\n2, Woodward Avenue\nDetroit, Michigan 48226\n\t\nMSU Remote Sensing staff worked with Wayne County Planning Commission\npersonnel to generate an inventory of land uses for the county as an essential\nprerequisite to implementation of the Michigan Farmland and Open Space Preservation Act (P.A.-116, 1974). This activity has been reported at an earlier\ndate.\nTo be fully implemented, however, the zoning ordinance of any local\ngovernment unit agreeing to participate in this program must be amended to\nincorporate provisions which will accommodate the special features of land\nreservation provided for in this State Act. In addition, the local zoning\nordinance must also incorporate revised land use district configurations to\nmesh with the county comprehensive development plan. The local unit must\nalso formally express concurrence with the policies of the county. These\nprocedures represent a complex political process and throughout, the ohotography served to focus discussions on the environmental issues at hand. Since\nlast reporting, five townships in Wayne County have progressively decided\nto join in this open space preservation program, by amending the appropriate\nzoning ordinances.\n\nr\n\n8\n\nA3. Implementation of Michigan Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act\nAntrim County Planning Department\nCounty Courthouse\nBellaire, Michigan 49615\nThe Antrim County Planning Department (ACPD) through the auspices of the\nMSU Project has used remote sensing in a direct manner to implement the State\nof Michigan Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act (P.A.-347, 1972).\nColor infrared photography provided an expeditious, legally acceptable means\nfor both evaluating site construction plans required for earth-change operations\nand for detecting potential viclations of codes and ordinances.\nThe Act requires that a site plan be approved and an "Earth Change"\npermit be obtained for any operation which will change the configuration of\nthe ground form........ i.e., an "earth change ......... if that activity is\nlocated within 500 feet of a lake or stream. Photography provides the means\nto evaluate both site plans and potential violations if the legislation.\nTwo examples indicate how this is applied in practice. In the first instance\nthe construction of a road was halted because the distance criteria had been\nviolated, and the stop-work order that was issued withstood legal challenge\nto the photographic evidence. Another exam p le related to the length and\npositioning of a lake groin wall. Here an original site plan was modified in\nrelation to erosion and sediment transport forces evident from the photography.\nThe Antrim County Planning Department now uses these methods on a continuing\nbasis.\n\nE\n\n9\nW,\n\nA. Land Value Appraisal - Charlevoix County, Michigan.\nCharlevoix County Equalization Department\nCounty Courthouse\nCharlevoix, Michigan 49720\nThe Charlevoix County Equalization Department is using color infrared\nphotography (CIR) to reassess more accurately land values, particularly for\nremote and isolated properties. Beaver Island, located 12 miles off the coast\ninto Lake Michigan provided the County with an especially difficult assessment\nproblem. Large scale black and white photography were available for the\nisland; but this imagery did not permit adequate identification of swamp and\nhigher ground which are the two basic criteria for property evaluation in such\nterrain. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of the terrain, usual ground\ninspection methods were deemed unfeasible. Land value appraisal and consequent property taxes levied for the Island, using such limited information,\nwere inevitably approximate and most imprecise. Using rudimentary intepretation and projection techniques, the Equalization Department personnel,\nwith CIR imagery provided by the MSU Program and MSU interpretative assistance,\nwere able to produce a simple land characteristics map of Beaver Island as\nwell as of several other islands in the County. All property valuations for\nthe islands have been reassessed and changed where appropriate on the basis\nof these mapped data backed up with photographic evidence.\nAppraisal of land value is becoming an increasingly complex and detailed\nprocess. Color infrared photography, used here without sophisticated equipment\nprovided an accurate and time-saving method which facilitated new value appraisal\nand assessment methods and achievements.\n\n.\t\n\n10\n\nA5. Grand Traverse Count+ Special Environments Inventory\ne -\n\nTraverse Bay Regional Planning Commission\nSuite 401, National Bank Building\nTraverse City, Michigan 49684\nThis study was a combination of a general land cover inventory and a\nspecial environments analysis conducted in collaboration with a group of public\nagencies. Grand Traverse County, located in the northwest corner of Michigan\'s\nLower Peninsula, urgently needed a network of land and other resource information\nfor multiple purposes. At the request of the Grand Traverse Bay Regional\nPlanning Commission ( GTBRPC), the Michigan State University Remote Sensing\nProgram joined in the collaborative endeavors of the County Planning Commission,\nthe Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation, and the Office\nof Land Use within the Michigan Department of Natural Resources ( DNR) in\ndeveloping a general 24 category land cover inventory together with the identification and "flagging" of a series of special environments.\nThe inventory data was derived from 1 : 36,000 color infrared imagery using\na four hectare grid and were recorded on specially - designed computer coding\nforms. These forms were constructed so that up to six land cover and seven\nspecial environment codes could be recorded for each four hectare cell.\nWith the raw data in this form, a specific locational indicator for each\ncell was assigned which then offered the possibility of analysis, evaluation\nand presentation of the generated information by computer methods. Real world\nconstraints and priority weightings can thereby be established as operating\nrules for information retrieval by which means information can be made accessible\nand useful for a variety of disparate uses.\nImmediately upon completion of the inventory the data were put to use\nas a resource base for County planning decisions. For example, the optimum\nlocation for a potential industrial park was derived by ider^ifying those cells\nwhich met the required sire criteria of isolation from residential areas, adequate transportation facilities, sufficient contiguous areas for expansion, etc.\nIn addition to these kinds of uses, the inventory information is being applied\nto locate optimal low environmental impact corridors, using weighted values\nfor each land use according to specific geographical areas, primarily the\n\nF.\n\n11\nr\n\nunincorporated territories of townships. The land cover inventory and particularly the special environments identification allow a tremendous variety\nof corridor options to be derived and made available for comprehensive and\ncoherent local discussion and evaluation ....... indispensable processes for\nfacilitating improved decisions for identification and selection of an o p\n-timu higwaycoridor.At heStaelve,theDpartmen ofStaeHighways\nand Transportation is closely monitoring the utility of special environments\ninformation. If experimental applications can demonstrate that this additional\nmethod fulfills an adequate function in assisting with highway corridor selection, the procedure can become a required element for future corridor studies.\n\nh\n\nW\n\n12\n\nB. R w S E A R C H A C T I V I T I E S\n\nSynopsis: This section outlines three projects in which remote sensing\ntechniques were applied to on-going research activities in an effort to improve\napplied research design. These research activities are directed at developing\nand testing a "method" or "system" which could detect, evaluate and analyze\nenvironmental features and relationships whereby effective policies could\nbe formulated for the appropriate control of land development and the preservation of basic ecological qualities.\n\n1 .\n\n13\n\nB1. Natural Resource Carrying Capacity\nUpon receipt of the NASA RB-57 color infrared photography in the fall\nof 1974, a special study was programmed for the 1974-75 grant year which would\ninitiate evaluation of the natural resource carrying capacity of a selected\ntest site for supporting various categories and intensities of human (cultural)\nactivities. By interpretive analysis of this regional area portrayed on the\ncolor infrared photography (1:56,500 and 1:113,000), a specific site was\nselected which consisted of a corridor 9.7 km. - wide by 39 km. long (380 km.\n\n2)JO\n\nrunning north-south up through the full length of Allegan County, Michigan.\nSelection was made from progressive evaluations of a series of alternative\npossibilities. This strip, mid-way between Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids, is\nvery lightly settled and comprises 17.4 percent of the total land area of\nAllegan County. A major controlled-access highway, U.S. 131, connects these\ntwo major cities and traverses north-south through the middle length of the\ntest strip.\nThis particular site was selected because of the low density of current\nland use, the existence of extensive "fragile" natural resource conditions\nand the high potential for intensive development occuring over the next two\ndecades at first along both sides of the connecting highway corridor, and then,\ninevitably,as lateral accretive extensions to varying depths.\nDuring this reporting period, the better known methods of inventory\nanalysis were evaluated and tentative models were derived and tested. Inventories were initiated for soils, vegetation, water characteristics, human\nsettlement patterns, land use, transportation routes, and other specific\nphysical features. Work on these inventories was not completed in the reporting\nperiod; but it is being held in readiness for resumption during periods when\nprogram priorities will accommodate.\nThe next phase will involve the testing of the nature and magnitudes of\nthese natural and cultural characteristics as to suitability and potential for\neither supporting or supplementing a variety of possible categories of use and\nnon-use of terrain. For example: human habitat, urban type settlement, agriculture, silvaculture, mining, sand-gravel extraction, biotic regeneration areas,\n\n14\n\nflood plans and stream low-flow augumentation, water quality, recreation,,\'\ntransportation, and land reserves for singular/multiple functions.\nThis preliminary series of endeavors achieved important results: (a) procurement of the essential imagery, (b) selection of a test site, (c) initiation\nof inventories of natural and cultural characteristics, and (d) derivation of\nmethods for analysis. From the inventory stage alone, it is intended that\nspin-offs of some short-term, second generational applications will adduce\nlocal decisions and actions of significance.\n\n_.\n\nr\n\n\t\n\n15\n\n! .\n\nB2. Soil Mapping\n\nThe extensive use of aerial photographs in soil survey practice suggested\nthat other (newer) types of aerial imagery might also prove useful. Currently\naerial photographs serve as base maps for field mapping and publication. Interpretation of aerial photographs aided by field observation, largely determines the location of soil boundaries mapped in the field. Seldom does a\nsurveyor explore and probe the entire length of a boundary between two different\nsoil mapping units. Rather, he allows his eyes to predict the boundary--both\nfrom his oblique view of the surrounding terrain and from the plan view afforded\nby the vertical aerial photograph at hand. The more distant his gaze, the more\nhe must rely on the photograph to obtain a geometrically accurate representation of the scene. Buildings, road intersections, distinctive shrubs and trees,\nand fencelines help the surveyor locate himself on his photograph, but irregular,\nand often subtle tone (grey scale) changes on the photograph are used to identify\nsoil patterns, some may conform to differences in land use, stages of cultivation, or sun-angle and slope.\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the use of image tone changes and\ntheir relation to soil patterns, and equally important, how these sometimes\nsubtle image tones may be reliably identified and emphasized. For this purpose\nmultispectral scanner (MSS) data were used and compared with the photographic\nfilm format. Multispectral data provides a flexible format which can be used\nto closely simulate many different types of films (including standard panchromatic photography). It also provides scene information in an image format\nfrom spectral regions outside the range of photographic films. Thus, MSS\nimagery might provide new Ond potentially useful terrain information.\nMultispectral and photographic data were collected on April 3 and 10, 1974\nfrom an east-west flight line across the northern portion of Jackson County,\nMichigan where a soil survey was in progress. These data were collected at\na flight altitude of almost 8,000 feet above terrain, rendering a photographic\nscale of approximately 1:15,840 and a multispectral image resolution of 24 feet\nby 24 feet. The multispectral data covered a swath 3 miles wide and 28 miles\nlong. Contact prints of the imagery were made and the April 3rd multispectral\n\n16\n\ndata were processed using an analog image processing unit known as the\nSPARC (Spectral Analysis and Recognition Computer). The processed images\nwere then enlarged to be comparable to the photographic prints and were taken\ninto the field to be tested under actual soil survey conditions and procedures.\nAs a result of two weeks of both general reconnaissance and detailed soil\nmapping using these images, the following conclusions were made:\n(1) The aerial photography was more useful than the multispectral imagery.\nIt provided greater detail and better geometric precision.\n(2) The color photography was slightly better than the panchromatic\nY:Lotography in that types and densities of vegetation were more easily\nidentified.\n(3) The multispectral imagery was useful in conjunction with and as a\ncomplement to the aerial photography, but the lack of detail and\n.slightly skewed image geometry limited its usefulness.\n(4) In the detailed survey of an 800 acre area, the thermal infrared\nimage provided useful information concerning the distribution of\norganic and mineral soils.\n(5) Processed images provided accurate identification and area determination of surface water, green vegetation (conifers and winter\nwheat), woodlands and brush, roads and buildings, and bare surfaces;\nbut these did not contribute greatly to the task of soil surveying.\n(6)\n\nImage collection in early April provided distinctive contrasts related\nto vegetation and drainage which were absent in the June field sheet.\nHowever, no information from cultivated fields was evident in the\nApril imagery.\n\n17\n\nB3. Augusta Creek Drainage Analysis\nThe Kellogg Biological Station research group is presently engaged in a\ncomprehensive ecological survey of the Augusta Creek Drainage Basin in Barry\nand Kalamazoo Counties. Their objective involves the welding of land use and\nbiological information to allow for valid conclusions relating watershed activities to in-stream ecological effects. An important part of this survey\ninvolves the delineation of basic land use practices in the watershed. Relative to this need, the Project has provided a land use map which was prepared\nmainly from data collected during the Western Kalamazoo Land Use Inventory\nProject.\nColor infrared photography, as well as other types of imagery acquired by\nNASA\'s RB-57 aircraft were jointly evaluated relative to the following investigative research areas: 1) locating unknown water, soil and waste inputs into\nthe stream such as groundwater (springs), county drains, logging, agricultural\npractical, etc; 2) determining forest cover for the drainage basin in order to\nestimate natural organic inputs; 3) quantifying submerged and emergent aquatic\nvascular plants along the stream; and 4) estimating the size and volume of the\nchannel. The results of the study will provide planners with a much clearer\nindication of the ecological consequences of alternate watershed and stream\nuse strategies.\n\nr\n\nis\n\nC.\t\n\nS E R V I C E A C T I V I T I E S\n\nSynopsis: The following group of remote sensing applications are those\noriented to consultation on the use of imagery, educational activities not\na part of other user applications, and the development of support materials to\nfoster additional remote sensing applications by new prospective users.\nThe MSU Project team has acted as a service bureau for an increasing\nnumber of potential users by providing a variety of kinds oftechnical assistance.\nBy Executive order of the Governor, the State of Michigan is divided into\n14 separate official planning regions (Figure 1), for the purpose of coordinating\nlocal planning and development actions, and integrating them with State policies\nand programs whereby overall State development may be orchestrated as systematically and effectively as possible. To facilitate these regional operations\nin making additions to their data bases, the MSU Project has provided general\ntechnical asaistance, NASA produced imagery, and training in the use of equipment to a number of these regional planning commissions and many county plannning\ncommissions.\nThe types and amounts of assistance provided varied between agencies;\nbut included varying degrees of the following activities:\n(1) Problem identification;\n(2) Data source identification;\n(3) Data classification procedures;\n(4) Identification of decisions that need to be made (policy and action\nchoices);\n(5) Determining data efficiencies to get at the policy and action choices;\n(6) Assistance in reviewing available imagery;\n(7) Assistance in acquiring available imagery and equipment;\n(8)\n\nImagery interpretation training.\n\nThe extent and duration of these technical assistance activities also\nvari.\t\n\nIn some cases, all that was necessary was to have the Project serve\n\nas consultants to arrange for the availability of appropriate imagery with a\nminimum of interpretation training. In others, almost a complete process was\nprovided, including extensive training.

At an\nappropriate stage in each agency\'s program, remote sensing may be the most\neconomical tool to accomplish program objectives.\nThe technical assistance element of the research will depend on expansion\nof the service bureau capabilities. An important part of this is the equipment\nand imagery available for use and loan to local and regional agencies. The\nextension of the local service bureau function is expected to result in increased\nuse by local agencies of the imagery available, as well as to create an interest\nin more detailed imagery of their local area. Information available from the\nimagery can serve several functions, not only in planning, but also in improved\ncapital improvement programs of the agencies involved.\nCurrently, efforts are being made to improve the accessibility of the\nholdings, the expertise, and the research findings of the Project for use by\nboth on-campus and off-campus users.\n\nj\n\n21\n\n}\n\nCl. Northwest Michigan Region Training Session\nN.W. Michigan Regional Planning Commission\n120 W. State Street\nTraverse City, Michigan 49684\nA special training session in the use of remote sensing techniques was\nconducted in Traverse City on September 10, and 11, 1974 by members of the\n14SU Remote Sensing Project. This was the first major step in assisting the\nNorthwest Michigan Regional Planning Commission in provision of a service\nbureau function in the Traverse City area to facilitate use of available NASA\nand Michigan Department of State Highways (MDSH) color infrared imagey by\nagencies in that area.\nIn attendance were 25 public officials from 8 of the 10 counties in this\nregional planning area. This group consisted of equalization directors, road\ncommissioners and local planners.\nThe training session started with an introduction to interpretation procedures which included lectures and exercises on: 1) an introduction to remote\nsensing, 2) a brief history of the Michigan Department of State Highways color\ninfrared imagery of this area, 3) stereo-vision, 4) metric measures, 5) the\ninterpretation process and 6) the use of oblique and ground level photography.\nDuring the second session the participants worked on land use interpretation\nexercises using the MASH photography, the proposed Department of Natural Resources\nstatewide land cover/use classification system, and intepretation keys furnished\nby the Remote Sensing Project. Employing this information they actually delineated land uses on the photography and then field checked their results.\nSession 3 consisted of concurrent group discussions related to special\nresource analysis applications of remote sensing e.g. detailed land use mapping,\ninventorying forest lands, wetland and shorelands assessment, agricultural\ninventories, and the evaluation of special environments. The last session\ndealt with techniques for evaluating remote sensing\'s role in resource analysis\nprograms which included a discussion of the interacting components that should\nbe considered when planning for resource analysis programs utilizing remote sensing technology.\nThe applications in Antrim and Charlevoix Counties described in this report,\nwere the first spin-off benefits from this training session.\n\nt_\n\n22\n\nC2. Self-Trainin g Modules\nThe primary focus of Project training activities to date has been through\ndemonstration and direct training of individuals and relatively small groups\nby the Project\'s personnel. The number of potential users which can be reached\nin thi\xe2\x82\xac way is necessarily limited by the staff and funds available. Further\t\n\nmore, many of these training activities are becoming quite repetitive. \t\n\nEfforts\n\nhave been directed toward circumventing this problem through the development\nof a series of self-training slide modules, which can be distributed to potential\nusers.\nIf basic techniques can be mastered by users through these modules, more\ntime will be available to Project staff for developing new applications or\nresolving particular difficulties which individual users may encounter.\nTwo modules have been prepared and are currently in the review stage.\nThe modules deal with basic techniques of photo interpretation and basic photo\nmeasurement and stereoscopic viewing.\n\nsgi\n\n23\n\nC3. Users Guide to Aerial Imagery of Michigan\nPreparation of the guide has beat. a continuing effort through the year\nand what started as a simple revision of an existing guide has developed into\nan undertaking of considerable magnitude. Major progress was mods in the reporting period. A computer retrieval system for IANbSAT imagery of Michigan\nhas been developed which organized the frames by appropriate nominal centers,\nthus facilitating the creation of an efficient indexing procedure for the\nframes and the production of tabular and map information for the guide. In\naddition the format for future additions is now established. The section\npertaining to NASA High Altitude Photography has now been compiled in presentation format and is currently under review.\nWork on the guide and image storage and retrieval is a continuing Project\nactivity.\n\ny\n\n{\n\n24\n\nD.\t\n\nC O N T R A C T A C T I V I T I E S\n\nSynopsis: Due to Project demonstration activities, there has been are\nincreasing need by public and private agencies within the State for the utilisation of remote sensing technology on a periodic project basis. In most cases,\nhowever, they lack the appropriate equipment and the photo interpretative skill\nto meet the need. Agencies usually do not intend to hire individuals with photo\ninterpretation expertise because their services are not headed on a continual\nbasis, but most agencies would like to have a means of acquiring such skills\nfor limited periods to complete specific projects. HSU now has the capability\nto meet this need through either a contractual or student support basis due\nto the development of on-campus faculty and student remote sensing expertise\nby Project personnel.\nAll of the agencies that have contracted with HSU came to the Project\nrequesting photo interpretation services. The Project has never actively\nengaged in the pursui\': of contracts. All of the contract activities have\noccurred as a direct spin-off from Project demonstration activities and thus\nhave been included in this report in order to substantiate the repetitive\nneed for phcto-derived Information and the o p erational capability of previously\ndemonstrated remote sensing procedures for specific data acquisition needs.\n\n25\n\nD1. Lower Kalamazoo River Basin Inventory\nRiver Basin Planning Croup\nSoil Conservation Service\n1405 S. Harrison Road\nEast Lansing, Michigan 46624\nThe MSU Project has had a continuing involvement with the River Basin\nPlanning Group of the Soil Conservation service (RBPG) and the other agencies\nworking with then. in a resource planninb effort for the Kalamazoo River basin.\nOur last report detailed a study by the Project which demonstrated the scope\nand efficiency of color infrared photography in providing land characteristics\ndata required by the RBPG. An inventory of the Uppir Kalamazoo watershed, an\narea of 2,600 square kilometers was completed. Subsequently the Project has\ncompleted on a contract basis a 22 category land cover inventory for the remainder of the Kalamazoo Basin. The contract price was $25,000 for the 5,800\nsquare kilometers of the Lower Basin, and ;11,000 of this cost went in the\nacquisition of color infrared imagery at a scale of 1:36,000 : copies of which\nwere retained by the Project. The output product of this work was presented\non mylar copies of U.S.G.S. topographic sheets at a scale of 1:61,360. This\nformat proved to be of great utility and the REPO initiated another contract\nworth $2,000 for the re-formating of the data gathered in the initial demonstration project.\n\nV\n\nr\nA land use inventory has been completed for Antrim County, Michigan..\nThis project provides an interesting example of the way in which applications\nof remote sensing can spread from one agency to another through the movement\nof trained personnel. One of the first activities under the Remote Sensing\nProject involved development of applications to highway impact assessment in\ncooperation with the Michigan Department of State Highways. A Highway Depart-_\t\n\nwent employee who was involved in that early effort has since taken. a position\nas County Planner for Antrim County.\nAs County Planner in Antrim, he has obtained pervission to use CIR imagery\noriginally collected by the Highway Department as a basis for preparation of\nland use maps for the.County. He has drawn up the specifications for the mapping\njob on the basis of experience gained in the earlier effort. A Michigan State\nUniversity student was hired to do the interpretation, and necessary space and\nequipment was provided by the Remote Sensing Project. Thus, the original\neffort with the Highway Department has in turn generated a subsequent application by an entirel; different agency. Furthermore, this second application\nhas required little direct effort on the part of Project personnel since the\nintepreter was paid by P.m. trim County.\n\n27\n\nD3. SEMCOG Land Use Inventory\nJohnson, Johnson and Roy\n303 N. Main Street\nAnn Arbor, Michigan 48104\nThe Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) requested the\nconsulting firm of Johnson, Johnson and Roy (JJ&R) to submit a proposal to\ncreate a land use inventory for their seven county area. Subsequently, JJ&R\nrequested separate contract bids from the Remote Sensing Project at MU and\nthe Department of Natural Resources at the University of Michigan to create\ndesignated portions of the land use inventory by means of photographic interpretation. The responsibility of the Remote Sensing Project was to prepare\nan eight category land use inventory base for four counties: Livingston,\nMacomb, Monroe and St. Clair. The final product was in the form of tally\nsheets indicating the area of each land use category per designated management\ndata zone. These were subsequently coded on computer records to create a\nmachine readable data file.\nAn integral part of this project was the development and testing of a\ndifferent set of procedures for land use data acquisition which included:\na)\n\nphotographic interpretation as part of a wider inventory process,\nwhereas in the past it has been the sole procedure employed;\n\nb)\n\ndevelopment of interpretive skills for a different area of Michigan;\n\nc)\n\ndevelopment of interpretive skills for a different type and scale of\nimagery (black and white Panchromatic, 1:24,000);\n\nd)\n\nemployment of a different classification system (a general 8 category\nscheme relative to past utilization of over 10 categories);\n\ne)\n\nmapping of land uses with a minimum type size of 1 acre as compared\nto a smallest mapped unit of 10 acres employed in past inventorying\nprojects;\n\nf) development and testing of different mensuration processes.\nThe contract was worth $8,000 and involved the acquisition of black and\nwhite imagery for St. Clair County.\n\n:\n\n^3\n+\t\n\nten.\n\n28\n\nA p p e n d i x\nP U B L I C A T I O N S a n d P R E S E N T A T I O N S\n. . . . . . . . . . of the Michigan State University Project\n\n1.
