These expanding frontiers\ninspire large numbers of our youth to consider careers in science,\nand thoughtful persons of all ages seek a .better understanding\nof the scientific-technological society in which we live. As a result, there is an insatiable demand for current, accurate scientific information. To fill this pressing need, the National Science\nTeachers Association has conceived and developed the VISTAS\nOF SCIENCE series. In so doing, NSTA advances its own central\npurpose: improvement of the teaching of science. In addition,\nVISTAS books provide scientific background for those who\nwould be well-informed, responsible citizens.\nDesigned at the request of students and teachers, the series\nis produced under the guidance of an experienced Advisory\nBoard (see facing page). Each book is concerned with a specific\nscience area, such as spacecraft, oceanography, astronomy, the\ncell, genetics, measurement.\nThree types of information characterize VISTAS OF SCIENCE books: presentation of subject matter; research frontiers\nand methods, and student activities. VISTAS are science resource and enrichment literature that is sound and challenging.\nWritten for junior and senior high school students, the VISTAS\nare of interest and value to teachers and other adults as well.\nSponsors of VISTAS books include governmental agencies,\nprofessional societies, and individual organizations. These groups\n\nhelp to support the program financially and cooperate to insure\nthat the manuscripts are developed as objective, authentic explorations of particular science areas.\nThe authors are scientists, science writers, and classroom\nteachers of outstanding experience, background, and communicative skills. Often a combination of authors develops the manu script - a scientist or science writer prepares the main text, and\na classroom teacher prepares the student activity section.\nAn advisory group, composed of a research scientist, a science\neducator, and a science teacher, assist in the planning and reviewing of each manuscript. These advisers represent three.\ngroups vitally concerned with providing sound education in\nscience.\nThe VISTAS OF SCIENCE books are made available by the\npublisher through its schoolbook club programs and by individual purchase. One copy of each VISTA is provided free\nto all school science clubs enrolled in NSTA\'s Future Scientists\nof America organization.\nThe VISTAS program, through the cooperative efforts of\nauthors, advisory groups, sponsors, NSTA, and the publisher,\nmakes possible low-cost, versatile science libraries in the science\nclassrooms of the nation\'s schools and encourages individual\nstudents to plan home science libraries as well.\nThe suggestions and comments of students, teachers, and\nother readers of VISTAS OF SCIENCE books will be welcome.\nRobert H.

Scores\nof man-made objects have been thrust into space, some of\nthem to roam the solar system forever.\nBehind each space mission are years of patient research,\nthousands of man-hours of labor, and large sums of money.\nBecause the sums involved are so enormous, the question is\nfrequently asked, "Is it worth it?" Many people want to know\nwhat return this huge investment will bring to mankind.\nThe return on the investment is knowledge. The accumulation of knowledge over the centuries has made possible our\nadvanced way of life. As we unlock more and more of the\nsecrets of the universe through space exploration, we add new\nvolumes to the encyclopedia of man\'s knowledge. This will\nbe applied to the benefit of mankind.\nFor the practical-minded, there are concrete benefits to\nour way of life. Although we are still in the Stone Age of\nspace exploration, a number of immediate applications of\nspace technology are already apparent.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nFor instance, imagine the benefits of an absolutely perfect\nsystem of predicting the weather. Or, going a step further, even\nchanging the weather. And wouldn\'t it be fascinating to watch\nthe next Olympic games, telecast from Tokyo, on your TV set?\nThese are just a few of the practical benefits made possible by\nspace technology.\nThe Meteorological Satellite\n\nLet us consider the weather satellite. The weatherman\nhas been the butt of many a joke about faulty predictions.\nBut it is not his ability to predict weather which has been\nat. fault; rather, it is lack of sufficient information upon which\nto base his predictions. Regular weather observations cover\nonly about one fifth of the Earth\'s surface. Too frequently the\nforecaster is unaware of changing conditions which might\ncompletely alter his prediction.\nAn Earth satellite equipped with television can provide\na precise picture of cloud and storm patterns around the globe.\nIt can circle the Earth every ninety minutes and transmit\nimages of the clouds which forecasters can analyze and interpret for more accurate weather predictions. Think of the\nadvantages of precise weather information to people engaged\nin air transportation or agriculture, to the sponsors of outdoor\nevents, and to homeowners in the paths of destructive storms.\nAnd, once accurate forecasting is available, we may be able\nto "do something about the weather."\nThe Communications Satellite\n\nAnother type of spacecraft which offers great potential\nbenefit is the communications satellite. Signals can be directed\nto the satellite from one point on Earth and rebroadcast to\nanother point or to another satellite.\nThe possibilities of communications satellites are vast,\nparticularly in the field of transoceanic messages, a good por8\n\nSOLAR\nRECEIVING ANTENNA\n\nTRANSMITTI\nANTEN\n\nBATTERIES\n\n-ANGLE TV CAMERA\n\nADAP\'\n\n"Applied" satellite; TIROS meteorological spacecraft. Its\ntelevision cameras survey Earth\'s cloud cover.\'\ntion of which are now handled by cable. Because the quantity\nof transoceanic messages has increased almost to the limitations of the present cable system, even a projected expansion\nof the system may not be adequate in a few years. The communications satellite may replace the cable and microwave\ndevices, and solve a major problem by opening up more\nchannels, permitting less expensive and more rapid message\ntransmissions. This will have great impact on foreign trade.\nThe communications satellite is also the answer to long-awaited\ninternational television, which might never come to pass if\nwe had to rely on cable systems of insufficient capacity.\nSpacecraft as Navigation Aids\n\nThe spacecraft also offers potential in the field of navigation, as an absolutely reliable means of fixing the position\nof a surface ship, a submarine, or an airplane. Accurately placed\nin a predetermined orbit and equipped with radio transmitters,\n9\n\nsatellites would become artificial "stars" by which vessels or\naircraft could navigate. Ships and planes would receive signals\nfrom satellites. Since the satellites would always be in a\nknown position, a navigator could easily determine his craft\'s\nposition in relation to that of the man-made "stars." The navigation satellite, efficient even on the darkest of nights, probably\nwill replace most of the navigation aids used today.\nThe science of geodesy - the study of the curvature, shape,\nand dimensions of the Earth - offers still another application\nfor spacecraft. A satellite could provide a base point in space\nfrom which we on Earth could measure precise distances between land masses and pinpoint exact locations of tiny islands.\nEven with today\'s advanced techniques, highly accurate measurements of this type are not possible.\nThese are just some examples of practical applications of\nspace technology. Others will become apparent as the science\n\n\r\n\nof space exploration advances. It must be stressed, however,\nthat the primary reason for exploring space is to gain knowledge. These practical applications are by-products of basic\nresearch, the goal of which is to add to man\'s knowledge without immediate regard for the manner in which the knowledge\nmay be employed.\nObservatories in Orbit\n\nOf profound importance from the scientific standpoint is\r\naccurate information on our solar system - its history and its\r\nplace in our galaxy. Spacecraft provide, for the first time, precise \r\ntools for acquiring such information. Examples of various spacecraft will soon be at work in this field, for it is planned to send\r\na series of observatories into space within the next few years. \r\nThese spacecraft observatories, equipped with a wide variety of scientific instruments, will orbit the Earth, collecting\n\nSatellites can provide an absolutely reliable navigation\nsystem, useful by day or night in any weather. This\nis because a satellite is an artificial "star."\nIts motion through the sky does not matter,\n\'s\t\nsince its position at any moment can be\nknown if its orbit has been precisely\ndetermined. A navigator can take a\ns\t\nradio direction finder "fix" on\nthe satellite\'s signals, measuring the time of day carefully,\nand thus know where he is\nin relation to satellite,\nas he normally does\nwith stars. U.S.\nhas launched\nnavigation\nsatellites.\nII\n\n11\n\ndata about the solar system. There are three basic types of\norbiting observatories: the orbiting geophysical observatory,\nthe orbiting astronomical observatory, and the orbiting solar\nobservatory.\nThe orbiting geophysical observatory, as it orbits around our\nplanet, will study the characteristics of Earth and near-space.\nOn one type of mission, it will go into an eccentric orbit which\nwill take it at times 70,000 miles from Earth and at other times\nas close as 175 miles, permitting collection of a wide range\nof data. On another mission, it will orbit about the North and\nSouth Poles, at altitudes of 175 to 700 miles, collecting other\ndata and studying, in particular, the unexplored regions of\nEarth\'s atmosphere above the poles.\nThe orbiting astronomical observatory will study the sun,\nstars, and planets. Equipped with large telescopes and other\nscientific instruments, it will orbit the Earth at about 500 miles\naltitude, high above the dense lower layers of atmosphere\nwhich distort observations made from the surface \'Of the\nEarth.\nThe orbiting solar observatory will orbit at about 300\nmiles altitude. Its battery of instruments will study the sun\nand its phenomena, in particular the various forms of solar\nradiation.\nThese orbiting observatories and other, more specialized,\nscientific spacecraft will contribute in great measure to our\nknowledge of the solar system. How will that benefit mankind?\nThere may be no immediate practical application for the\nknowledge we gain about our Earth\'s origins, but enlightenmerit is a goal in itself.\n\n12\n\nHistory\nof\nSpace Flight\nN October 4, 1957, the world was electrified by the news\nQ that the Soviet Union had succeeded in placing a manmade object in orbit about the Earth. Although that date is\naccepted as the formal beginning of space flight, a complete\nhistory of the subject starts at a much earlier date.\nThe exploration of space began long before man had\nthe means to send objects into space. It started when man\nfirst realized that the planet he inhabited was not the only\nbody in space. The first such recorded belief can be found in\nthe writings of Plutarch, who lived in the first century A.D.\nThe first major step in theoretical space exploration\noccurred in the sixteenth century with the invention of the\ntelescope. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, astronomers such as Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo\ncharted the motion of celestial bodies and laid the groundwork\nfor modern space research.\nBefore man could explore space itself, he needed a means\nfor thrusting his instruments beyond Earth\'s atmosphere. It\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nPrime problem of space exploration is getting "up" there.\nFirst step was made by U.S.\nscientist Dr. Robert Goddard,\nwho fired first liquid-fueled\nrocket, on March 16, 1926.\n\nhad to be a type of propulsion which did not need air for its\noperation, since in space there is little or no air. This was a\ncharacteristic of the rocket engine. Rockets existed centuries\nbefore the first spacecraft went into orbit, but in a primitive\nform hardly adaptable to space exploration.\nAs early as A.D. 1232 the Chinese had used rockets, or\n"arrows of flying fire," against invading Mongols. Rockets\nwere used as weapons for centuries thereafter, until the latter\npart of the nineteenth century, when the accuracy of conventional artillery put the erratic rocket on the shelf. Over the\ncenturies, the rocket went through several stages of development, but it never became more than a short-range method of\npropulsion.\n14\n\nDr. Goddard and the Rocket\n\nNot until the twentieth century were the first steps taken\ntoward developing the rocket as a\xe2\x80\xa2 means of space propulsion. The honor fell to an American physicist, Dr. Robert\nH. Goddard, who is generally acknowledged as the father of\nmodern rocketry.\nDr. Goddard started theoretical work on rocket propulsion as early as 1915, in order to study the upper atmosphere\nand the region beyond. He built and ground-tested a number\nof small rockets powered by liquid fuel and made his first\nsuccessful rocket launching on March 16, 1926. This was the\nactual start of the development of space "hardware."\nShortly after Dr. Goddard\'s initial success, Germany and\nRussia became interested in rocket development. By the mid1930\'s, scientists in all three\'countries were firing rockets more\nthan a mile into the air. According to one report, in 1936 the\nRussians reached an altitude of twelve miles.\nAt this point, however, the Russians apparently lost interest in rocketry and dropped their developmental program until\nafter World War H. In the United States, Dr. Goddard was\nunable to find the financial support he needed to build the\nlarger rockets he had planned. It remained for Germany, aware\nof the military potential of the rocket, to carry forth its development. Throughout World War II, the Germans conducted\nextensive rocket research at the experimental station of Peenem\xc3\xbcnde. The research culminated in the development of the\nhuge, deadly V-2 rocket, used against England in the closing\nmonths of the war.\nThe V-2 served as the forerunner of our modern space\nboosters. After the defeat of Germany, both the United States\nand the Soviet Union took quantities of V-2\'s and used them\nas a basis for developing long-range missiles, which in turn\nbecame boosters for early space launchings. Modified versions\nof the V-2 were also used in the United States to boost instru15\n\nNew sight among the stars\xe2\x80\x94the flash of sunlight off tumbling body of a satellite\'s carrier rocket.\n\nmented packages more than a hundred miles above the Earth\nin research programs aimed at exploring the upper atmosphere.\nAlthough they did not go into orbit, these "sounding" rockets\nmight be considered the first spacecraft.\nBut these rockets were able to record upper-atmosphere\ndata for only a few minutes. The next logical step was to\nattempt to put a vehicle into orbit around the Earth, so that it\ncould send back continuous information on air densities, solar\nradiations, magnetic fields, and other conditions in space.\nEarly Satellites\n\nOn July 29, 1955, the United States announced plans to\ndevelop such an orbiting vehicle under a program called Project\nVanguard. On October 4, 1957, months before Vanguard was\nready for launching, Scientists of the U.S.S.R. sent Sputnik\nI into orbit, followed in thirty days by Sputnik II. A second\nAmerican program, called Explorer, resulted in the successful\nlaunching of the first U. S. satellite on January 31, 1958. Almost\n16\n\nthirty-two years to the day from\nthe time of Dr. Goddard\'s first\nlaunching, Vanguard was placed\nin orbit on March 17, 1958. It\nis still circling the Earth and\ntransmitting information. Estimates of its orbiting life vary from 200 to 2,000 years!\nSince Sputnik I was\nboosted into orbit, the spaceexploration programs of both\nthe United States and the Soviet Union have yielded exceptional results. One of the most\nspectacular accomplishments of\nthe early years of the Space Age\ncame on April 12, 1961, when\nthe Soviet spacecraft Vostok\ncarried cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin\nthrough a single orbit and returned him safely to Earth. A\nmonth later, the first U.S.\nmanned spacecraft, a bellshaped capsule named Freedom\n7, carried astronaut Alan Shepard more than a hundred miles\nfrom Earth. On August 6, 1961,\nthe Soviet spacecraft Vostok II\ncarried cosmonaut Gherman S.\nTitov through seventeen orbits.\nIn the three and one-half\nyears of space exploration between Sputnik I and Vostok\nII, the most notable achievements were these:\n\nUS ARMY\n\nFirst U.S. satellite, Explorer I, was\nput in orbit by Jupiter-C rocket.\nLaunch was from Cape Canaveral,\nJanuary 31, 1958.\n\nI\n\nFour spacecraft escaped Earth\'s gravity and went into\norbit around the sun, where they will remain for millions of\nyears. One of them, the U.S. Pioneer V, transmitted data on\nthe interplanetary environment by radio, more than 22,500,000\nmiles to Earth.\nOne Soviet spacecraft crashed on the moon on September\n13, 1959.\nOn August 10, 1960, a U. S. spacecraft became the first\nobject ever recovered from Earth orbit.\nThe first animals to survive Earth orbit were recovered\non August 20, 1960, in a Soviet experiment.\nAs fascinating as are these achievements of the early years,\nthey are only small steps compared with what is to come. Those\nof us who are alive in these latter years of the twentieth century will witness the greatest adventures of all time, as man\nmoves farther and farther into space. In the following chapters, you will learn about the vehicles man will use to explore\nthe void beyond our atmosphere, the spacecraft which will\nhelp us learn the secrets of the mysterious universe.\n\nloop\n\nO\n\n---.--rMOKNERM\n\nMonkeys preceded men into space. This is rhesus monkey "Able," after\nhis 1,500-mile ride in nose cone of a U.S. Jupiter rocket.\n18\n\n\r\n\nTypes\nof\nSpacecraft\nHERE are a number of types of spacecraft. They differ\nT in size, kinds of instruments, and manner of performance.\nEach type and its instruments are designed to accomplish certain specific tasks.\nThe Sounding Rocket\n\nThe simplest type of spacecraft is the sounding rocket,\r\nwhich carries a package of instruments to record data. Sounding rockets do not have sufficient velocity to go into orbit. \r\nWhen they have exhausted their rocket power, sounding \r\nrockets fall back to Earth. They are a simple, relatively inexpensive method of collecting scientific information, and are\r\nused in experiments requiring only a brief exposure to space.\r\nIn some cases, the entire sounding rocket is the spacecraft.\r\nIt contains (1) a set of instruments designed to obtain specific \r\ninformation and (2) equipment to transmit the information\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nback to Earth for later analysis. In other cases, a rocket is used\nto boost a payload into space. The payload is usually a capsule\ncontaining instruments, cameras, and other devices with which\nto conduct an experiment. This capsule can be separated or\nejected from the main rocket to return to Earth by parachute.\nGenerally, the sounding rockets in use carry small payloads\nweighing up to 150 pounds. Most of the sounding rockets fired\nto date have been launched to altitudes of less than 200 miles.\nHowever, sounding rockets may go as high as 4,000 miles.\nBeyond that altitude, they are no longer considered sounding\nrockets but "geospace probes."\nThe Earth Satellite\n\nThe typ\' f spacecraft we hear about most often is the\nEarth satellite. This, type of craft moves in an orbit around\nEarth.\nIn the past few years, the word "orbit" has become very\nfamiliar; but for a better understanding of the operation of an\nEarth satellite we should take a closer look at this word. The\ndictionary defines the noun "orbit" as "The path in space along\nwhich a heavenly body moves about its center of attraction."\nOrbit is also used as a verb, meaning, to move along a path\ncentered on some body in space.\nOur planet Earth is itself in orbit. Its "center of attraction"\nis the star we call the sun, and there are eight other planets\norbiting around the sun. At this very moment, Earth is hurtling\nthrough space at the rate of almost twenty miles per second in\nits path around the sun; at that rate, it takes approximately 365\ndays to complete a revolution around the sun.\nWhat keeps the Earth moving in a near-circular path\naround the sun? It is the sun\'s gravity, the force which pulls\nthe Earth toward the sun.\nThe Earth is always falling toward the sun. Why doesn\'t\nthe Earth fall into the sun? Some basic laws of physics give\nus the answer. The Earth is a moving body, and like any other\n20\n\nIii\nI-J\n\nLU\ncm\n\n\xe2\x80\x94I\nw\n\n0\ncc\nIL\n\nU)\n\nlU\n\'-3\nU)\n\n/\n/\n\nSt\nSt\n\n/\n/\n\n\'I\nU)\nz\n0\n\nI\n\nI\'\n\nI\nI\n\nSt\n\\\n\n/\n/\n\nU)\n\nI-\n\nUC.)\nw\n\nC.)\nIL\nco\nC.)\nU)\nco\n\n0\nLi-\n\nLu\nI-J\n-J\nIii\nI-\n\n4\n\n4=\n\nU)\n\nJbb\n\nLii\n\nn\n>\xe2\x80\x94..\n\nLu\nz\nz\n\n4\n\n2\n\nmoving body the Earth tends to continue its motion in a\nstraight line. Thus the Earth would move off into space if there\nwere no solar gravity. Since the sun pulls on the Earth with\na constant force, the path followed by the Earth becomes circular. It is the result of two equal forces interacting at right\nangles. When an object is moving in a circular path (as the\nEarth is moving around the sun), the force pulling the object\ntoward the center of the circle is called "centripetal force." The\nEarth seems to exert an equal, but opposite, force against the\nsun\'s gravitational force. This reaction force is called "centrifugal force." It is extremely useful in explaining circular motion.\nEarth has a gravitational force of its own and it also has a\nnatural satellite, the moon. The same interacting forces which\nkeep the Earth in orbit about the sun also keep the moon in\norbit around the Earth.\nTry this experiment for a better understanding of the rela-\n\nT\n\nADAPTED FROM PHYSICS IN THE SPACE AGE, BY SHULZ AND LAGEMANN, LIPPINCOTT. Igel\n\n"Orbit" results from the interaction of forces. Here, acceleration in\nline tangent to circle is opposed by centripetal force of string.\n22\n\ntion between the so-called centrifugal force and the force of\ngravity: Tie a weight to a piece of string about a yard long.\nHold the string between your thumb and forefinger and whirl\nthe weight rapidly. The weight represents a satellite in motion\naround a "body." Your thumb and forefinger take the place of\nan imaginary celestial body. The piece of string, then, represents the force of gravity. As long as the weight at the end of\nthe string has sufficient velocity, the string will remain taut and\nthe weight will "orbit" in a perfect circle. The weight tends to\npull away from your hands in a straight line, tangent to its\ncircular path, but the string restrains it, and the interaction\nbetween the two forces maintains the circular motion.\nNow, gradually slow the weight down. The string becomes\nslack and the weight tumbles toward the ground. Having lost\nits velocity, the weight "falls out of orbit."\nMon-made "Moon"\n\nKeeping this illustration in mind, let us consider the Earth\nsatellite. In launching a satellite into orbit around the Earth,\nwe are creating a man-made moon. In order for the satellite to\ngo into orbit and remain in orbit, it must be provided with\nvery high speed. The speed will create a force which tends to\npull the satellite away from Earth, but gravity restrains it. At\nexactly the right speed the satellite will orbit. Scientists can\ncompute this speed mathematically. The speed varies, depending on the desired altitude of orbit. At a hundred miles altitude,\nit is about five miles per second, or 18,000 miles per hour.\nFarther from Earth, the orbital speed is lower, because Earth\'s\ngravitational pull decreases with distance.\nThe first requirement for an orbiting satellite, then, is\nspeed. This speed is provided by a "booster," a high-powered\nrocket which carries the satellite up to its orbital altitude,\ngradually accelerating until it reaches the required speed. The\nsecond requirement is a method of guidance. The satellite must\nbe aimed into the desired orbital path around Earth. We will\n23\n\nESCAPE\nmi/Se\n\nI\t\n\nI\n\'I\n\n1\t\n\nCIRCULAR\nORBIT\t\n\nProjectiles, planets, manmade satellites conform\nto same laws. Below "escape velocity," satellites\nmove in elliptical orbits.\nAt escape velocity a satellite has no orbit with\nrespect to the Earth, and\nmust move into "outer\nspace."\n\nELLIPTICAL\n\nORBIT\n\nADAPTED FROM PHYSICS IN THE SPACE AGE, BY SHULZ AND LAGENANN, LIPPINCOYT, 1961\n\ndiscuss boosters and guidance in the following chapter.\nLet us assume that the satellite has been "injected" into\na precise circular orbit around Earth at a speed of 18,000 miles\nper hour. Gravity has been canceled out by the satellite\'s speed,\nso the satellite has no weight. It is "floating" in space, but it\nis floating at terrific speed; in fact, the same speed at which it\nentered orbit. It needs no additional power to maintain its\nspeed, because there is nothing to slow it down. An airplane\nflying a few miles from the Earth\'s surface needs constant power\nto overcome the resistance of the air. In space there is no air\nto provide resistance, so the satellite continues at its original\nspeed. (Actually, air molecules exist far into space, but in\nsuch minute quantities that we can disregard them for purposes\nof this discussion, since their effect on satellite operation is\nnegligible.)\nWhat if we wanted to bring the satellite back to Earth\nafter a period in orbit? Satellites can be designed to be brought\nback. They can be fitted with small rockets which are ignited\n24\n\nby a radio signal from Earth. These rockets are called "retro\nrockets." They fire in reverse direction to slow the satellite\ndown. When the satellite slows, its speed can no longer cancel\nout the centripetal force of Earth\'s gravity. Gravity takes over\nand draws the satellite back toward Earth. Still circling, the\nsatellite falls lower and lower on. each revolution until it enters\nthe layer of atmosphere surrounding Earth, where air resistance slows it still more.\nAlthough the satellite has slowed considerably, it is still\nmoving at a very high rate of speed, thousands of miles per\nhour. As it hurtles into the thicker layer of atmosphere at this\ngreat speed, the friction of the air particles moving over its surface builds up an intense heat. The temperature rises higher\nthan that of a blast furnace. How can we prevent the satellite\nfrom melting under this intense heat?\nThere are a number of ways to approach this problem of\nre-entry heating. One method is to build into the satellite a\n"heat shield," a layer of heavy material which absorbs the\nfriction heat as the satellite plunges through the atmosphere and\ndelays the build-up of temperature on the satellite itself. Protection must be provided if the satellite is to carry humans.\nIn the majority of cases, however, there is no need to bring the\nsatellite back to Earth intact, and it is permitted to burn up\nin the atmosphere.\nAll Shapes and Sizes\n\nWhat does a satellite look like? Actually, there is no single\nanswer. Among the satellites launched to date, some have been\nspherical, some cylindrical, some bell-shaped. Since the satellite does not have to combat air resistance as it courses through\nspace, the design is flexible. The shape of an airplane is dictated\nlargely by the fact that it must move through the atmosphere.\nIt must have wings, over which the air flows to provide lift,\nand it must have "streamlining" to minimize the effect of air\nresistance. But this is not the case with the satellite. It needs\n25\n\nno wings or streamlining. It is simply a shell to encase the\nequipment which is to be sent into space. The type, amount,\nand size of the equipment determine the shape of the satellite.\nA paramount factor in satellite design is weight. In order\nto go into orbit, the satellite must be boosted to a speed of\napproximately 18,000 miles per hour. The heavier the satellite,\nthe greater the amount of rocket thrust needed to reach this\nspeed. Because there are limits as to the amount of rocket\npower presently available, there are also limits as to how heavy\na satellite maybe.\nThe path of a satellite around the Earth is more likely to\nbe elliptical than circular. With very precise guidance and\nspeed control, it is possible to place a spacecraft in a circular\norbit. But even the slightest deviation in the velocity or in the\nangle at which the spacecraft is injected into orbit will produce\nan ellipse. In addition, Earth satellites are usually placed in\nelliptical orbit deliberately to cover a range of altitudes and\nhence obtain varied data.\nA spacecraft is normally injected into orbit close to Earth,\nat an altitude of a few hundred miles, but in following its orbit\nit may reach a point several thousand miles from Earth. The\npoint in orbit closest to the Earth is called the "perigee"; the\nmost distant point is called the "apogee."\nLunar, Planetary, and Interplanetary Spacecraft\n\nIn addition to sounding rockets and Earth satellites, a\nthird category of spacecraft includes lunar, planetary, and\ninterplanetary spacecraft. A planetary spacecraft is one designed to explore a specific planet, either by landing on it or\norbiting around it. Spacecraft of this type will have aerodynamic design features to help them penetrate the atmosphere\nof the target planet, if the assigned mission calls for a planetary\nlanding. Interplanetary spacecraft are those which acquire information from the areas between the orbits of the planets.\nLike the Earth satellites, they need no streamlining or lift\n26\n\ndevices unless their missions require a return tc) Earth. Lunar\nspacecraft, of course, are planned for trips to or near the\nmoon.\t\nThese three types of spacecraft have a requirement beyond\nthat of. the Earth satellite. Where the Earth satellite remains in\na state of balance between Earth\'s gravity and its own centrifugal force, these farther-traveling craft must completely escape from the pull of Earth\'s gravity in order to move farther\ninto space.\nEscape from Earth\n\nLet us go back to our experiment of the weight on the\nend of the string. At a certain rotational speed, imparted by\nyour hand, the weight stays in a precise circular orbit. Now,\nsuppose you could continue to . increase the rotational speed\nby moving your hand ever faster. What would happen? Eventually, the weight would reach a speed at which the string could\nno longer hold it. The string would break and the weight\nwould go hurtling off into space.\nThis illustrates the technique of launching probes to the\nmoon or to the planets. They must escape Earth\'s gravity, and\nthis is accomplished by providing them with more speed. At a\nspeed of seven miles a second, or about 25,000 miles per hour,\nthe force developed is greater than the opposing pull of gravity.\nSo Earth\'s gravity becomes the broken string in our illustration\nand the probe moves off into space.\nThe path of a planetary or interplanetary spacecraft is an\nellipse around the sun. For a better understanding of this\npath, draw this rough picture of the solar system: Make a\npoint on a piece of paper. This represents the sun. Using the\npoint as the center, draw nine concentric circles. Each circle\nrepresents the orbit of one of the planets as it travels around\nthe sun. The third circle is the orbit of Earth, the starting point\nfor all spacecraft. Now draw a curved line from the Earth\ncircle to the fourth circle, which represents the orbit of Mars.\n27\n\nTo reach an outer planet, such as Mars, space probe must be launched\nin the same direction as the Earth\'s orbital motion (eastward) and given\na higher velocity, so that it will take a larger orbit. When probe is\nlaunched in direction opposite to Earth\'s orbit, probe falls into smaller\norbit taking it on course toward inner planets.\n.- 4cc\n\'-\n\n-,\t\n\nN\nSPACECR4\n\n- of\n\n/\t\n\n$\n\n\\\'\n\\\n\nEARTH\'S\t\nORBIT\t\n\n,\'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2___\t\n\nI\nI\n\nEARTH\t\n\nVENUS\n\n/\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\nMARS\n\n04^*^^^\nk:04 0\xe2\x80\x94l uorlolv\n^j\nThis is the path of the spacecraft, and, of course, the length \r\nof the curved line depends on where the planet Mars lies in \r\nrelation to the Earth. At times Mars is close to Earth; at other\r\ntimes it is on the opposite side of the sun. Curiously, the most\r\nfavorable time for a Mars launch is not when Mars is nearest \r\nEarth, but when it is on the opposite side of the sun. The best \r\nEarth-to-Mars path, then, is a half ellipse around the sun which \r\nmeets Mars\' orbit when the sun is between Earth and Mars.\r\nNow draw a curved line out to the ninth circle, the orbit \r\nof Pluto. You can see that, because of the distance, the space28\n\ncraft would need a much higher initial speed to travel to Pluto\nthan to Mars.\nA spacecraft can escape from Earth\'s gravity at a speed\nof 25,000 miles per hour, but that speed is not sufficient to take\nit to Mars. For the Mars mission, a speed of more than 26,000\nmiles per hour would be required. A trip to Jupiter would require an initial velocity of more than 32,000 miles per hour,\nand the voyage to distant Pluto would require a speed of about\n88,000 miles per hour.\nKeeping these factors in mind, we will now move on to a\ndiscussion of how the initial velocity is obtained through the\nuse of the launch vehicle.\nFROM HOUSE DOCUMENT 86, 81ST CONGRESS, 151 SESSION\n\nPLANET\t\nMERCURY .........................................................................\nVENUS ................................................................................\nMARS .................\nJUPITER ............................................................................\nSATURN .............................................................................\nURANUS ............................................................................\nNEPTUNE .........................................................................\nPLUTO .................................................................................\n\nMinimum\nlaunching\n\nvelocity Transit time\n(feet per\nsecond)\n\n44,000\n38,000\n38,000\n46,000\n49,000\n51,000\n52,000\n53,000\n\n110 days\n,J\n150 days\t\n260 days 1:\n2.7 years\n6 years\n16 years\n31 years\n46 years\n\nMINIMUM LAUNCH VELOCITIES TO PLANETS\n\n29\n\nThe\nLaunch\nVehicle\nSPACECRAFT can be defined as a vehicle that performs\nA an experiment in space. To perform its experiment, it\nmust first be thrust into space through the layer of atmosphere\nsurrounding the Earth. This is the job of the launch vehicle.\nThe launch vehicle resembles a guided missile, and, in\nfact, most of the early launch vehicles actually were guided\nmissiles. There are now - in being or in development - a\nnumber of more advanced launch vehicles especially designed\nfor boosting payloads into space.\nLaunch vehicles differ considerably in size and in payloadboosting capability, but in general all launch vehicles have\nthree major elements. These are an airframe, a power plant,\nincluding a method of propulsion and a supply of propellants,\nand a system of guidance.\nThe airframe is simply the structure that encases the other\nmajor components of the vehicle, protecting them from damage,\neither on the ground or in flight.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\no\nt\n\nREACTION\n\nNewton\'s Third Law: For every action, there is an equal\nand opposite reaction. Firing a projectile, or throwing\nbricks off a wagon, causes cannon or wagon to recoil.\nRocket recoils from escaping gases.\n\nThe Power Plant\n\nSince the rocket engine can operate outside the atmosphere, it is the method of propulsion used for launch vehicles.\nIn simplest terms, a rocket engine is a furnace in which fuel\nis burned to create a gas. The burning process causes the gas\nto expand and exert pressure against the outlet provided by\nthe exhaust nozzle of the rocket, through which the gases\nescape at high speed.\n31\n\nIt is this high-speed outrushing of the gas stream which\nprovides the power to move the launch vehicle. The source\nof momentum is expressed by Sir Isaac Newton\'s Third Law\nof Motion, which states that for every action there is an equal\nand opposite reaction. The rapid movement of the gas through\nthe exhaust nozzle is the action. As the gas escapes, it creates a\nreaction, or a push in the opposite direction. More specifically,\nat the start of a space launch, the gas escapes downward creating an upward push.\nThe magnitude of the force created by the reaction depends on how much substance is burned and expanded (mass),\nand how rapidly it passes through the exhaust nozzle (velocity). The force is measured in pounds of thrust. To boost a\nspacecraft into orbit requires a thrust of about one and onehalf times the total weight of the launch vehicle and the spacecraft. For instance, if the launch vehicle - including the weight\nof the rocket engines, their propellants and tankage, the guidance system, the structure of the airframe, and the spacecraft\nitself - weighs 100,000 pounds, it would take about 150,000\npounds of thrust to place the spacecraft in orbit. Since the huge\nlaunch vehicles are extremely heavy, it can readily be seen\nthat tremendous amounts of rocket thrust are required to send\neven a moderate-size spacecraft beyond the atmosphere.\nBy far the greatest portion of weight and volume of th\xe2\x82\xac\nlaunch vehicle is taken up by the rocket propellants. The\nstandard type of rocket power plant is the chemical rocket,\nwhich uses two different types of propellants called "fuel" and\n"oxidizer." In an automobile, power is obtained by burning a\nmixture of gasoline and oxygen, the latter being extracted from\nthe air. The rocket engine operates on a similar principle, except that it does not draw in oxygen from the atmosphere.\nHowever, oxygen or a substitute is required for the burning\nprocess. Thus the launch vehicle must carry along a supply of\noxidizer which is mixed with the fuel for combustion.\nA rocket may use either liquid or solid propellants. Practi32\n\ncally all of the rockets launched\nin space programs to date have\nbeen liquid-propelled. From the\ntime of Dr. Goddard\'s experiments, greatest emphasis has\nbeen placed on developing this\ntype of power plant, and the\nfirst generation of guided missiles used liquid propellants exclusively. In the liquid-fuel\nrocket, the fuel and oxidizer are\nstored in separate tanks within\nthe airframe and fed into a\ncombustion chamber. There\nthey are ignited, creating the\npropulsive gas which escapes\nat high velocity to provide\nthrust. Typical fuels include\nkerosene, alcohol, and liquid\nhydrogen. Oxidizers in use include liquid oxygen, nitric acid,\nand nitrogen tetroxide.\nIn a solid-fuel rocket, the\nfuel and oxidizer are contained\nin a single solid mass. The solid\npropellant is stored within the\nrocket combustion chamber,\nwhere it is ignited to produce\nthe propulsive gas. The advantages of the solid-fuel rocket\nare these: it is simpler to handle,\nbecause there is no need for the\ncomplicated system of tanks,\npumps, and valves used in the\nliquid-fuel rocket. Also the solid-\n\nOXI\nT\n\nTANK\n\nJRBINE\n\nPUMI\n\nPUMP\n\nVALVE\n\nTflP\n\nTHRUST\nCHAMBER\n\nDiagram of liquid-fueled rocket.\n\nfuel rocket can be fueled well in advance of a launch, because\nthe solid fuel can be stored safely for long periods, whereas a\nliquid oxidizer tends to evaporate rapidly.\nCertain combinations of fuel and oxidizer, whether liquid\nor solid, perform better than others; that is, they develop more\nthrust per given weight of propellant. Propellant performance\nis measured by the number of pounds of thrust produced by\neach pound of propellant in a single second. This is called the\n"specific impulse" and it is listed in seconds. For instance, when\nscientists say a typical fuel-oxidizer combination has a specific\nimpulse of 250 seconds, that means it produces 250 pounds of\nthrust for each pound of propellant burned in one second. Specific impulse is a very important factor in space research. As\npropellants with higher specific impulses are developed it becomes possible to send larger payloads into space and to accelerate them to higher velocities. For this reason, there is a great\ndeal of propellant research under way on both liquid- and solidfuel rockets.\nNuclear-fueled Rockets\n\nIn addition to the chemical-fueled rocket now used as a\npower plant for the launch vehicle, there is the nuclear-fueled\nrocket, still in an early stage of development. In this type of\nengine, there is no burning process such as that described for\nthe chemical rocket. Instead of the fuel plus oxidizer, a single\n"working fluid" (liquid hydrogen is the propellant considered\nmost likely) is stored in a tank within the airframe. This fluid\nis passed through a nuclear reactor which heats it to very high\ntemperatures, creating the exhaust gas which provides thrust.\nNuclear-fueled rockets, when fully developed, will yield very\nhigh specific impulses. For instance, where current chemicalfueled rockets have specific impulses of from 200 to 300 seconds, it is estimated that the nuclear-fueled rocket will produce\na specific impulse of 1,200 seconds. This will enable us to ac34\n\ncomplish more advanced space missions, such as sending large\npayloads to the other planets.\nThe Guidance System\n\nThe final major component of the launch vehicle is the\nsystem of guiding and controlling the vehicle to a predetermined\npoint in space. There the payload, or spacecraft, is released from\nthe launch vehicle to go into orbit around the Earth, to probe\nspace and return to Earth, or to escape from Earth\'s gravity and\nstart a course to another planet.\nThere are a number of types of guidance systems. The\nchoice of guidance system depends on the mission assigned to\nNUCLEAR ROCKET COMPONENTS\nPAYLOAD\nGUIDANCE\n\nHYDROGEN TANK\n\nSHIELD\nTU BI NE P\nREACTOR\nHYDROGEN-COOLED NOZZLE\n\nC\nz\n0\nC\nU\nC\nC\n\nA nuclear rocket promises high specific impulse (pounds of thrust per\npound of fuel per second). Instead of burning, fuel vaporizes and\nexpands as reactor heats it, escapes through nozzle to provide thrust.\n35\n\nthe spacecraft. A sounding rocket, for instance, might be hurled\nto an altitude of 1,000 miles to perform an experiment and then\nfall back into the atmosphere. The guidance requirement would\nbe minimal; the rocket need be aimed only toward a planned\nrecovery area, so that it could be retrieved after its brief journey\ninto space.\nTo place a spacecraft in Earth orbit, however, requires\nmuch more precise aiming. At the point of injection into orbit\xe2\x80\x94\nthe point at which the spacecraft usually separates from the\nlaunch vehicle\xe2\x80\x94the spacecraft must be in the right position and\nmust be moving at the proper velocity for the desired orbit.\nA launch vehicle carrying an Earth satellite is guided only\nto the point of injection. There are two basic guidance systems\nwhich lend themselves to space launches: inertial guidance and\nradar guidance.\n"Brains" for Guidance\n\nIn the most simplified terms, the inertial guidance system\nhas an electronic "brain" which is programed to "know" where\nthe launch vehicle should be at all times en route to the point\nof injection. Another set of instruments measures the side-toside and fore-and-aft movements of the launch vehicle in flight.\nThis information is relayed to the electronic brain or computer, which continuously computes the speed of the vehicle,\nits course, and the distance traveled. The brain compares the\nactual position of the vehicle with the position it "knows" the\nvehicle should maintain. If the vehicle is off its proper course,\nthe brain actuates controls which correct the course. Course\ncorrections are made by rockets. The launch vehicle may have\nsmall auxiliary rockets for this purpose, or the main rocket\nengine may be caused to swivel. Sometimes the main rocket\nmay have vanes within the exhaust nozzle which can be moved\nto deflect the flow of gas and thus change the direction of the\nrocket\'s course.\nThe brain also "knows" the exact distance from launch\n36\n\npoint to the point of injection, and throughout the flight it measures how far the vehicle has moved along that path. At the\nprecise point of injection, it shuts off the power in the launch\nvehicle and sets off the mechanism which separates the spacecraft from its carrier. In a liquid-fuel rocket, the brain "orders"\nthe propellant valves to shut, cutting off power immediately. In\na solid-fuel rocket, the brain may direct the opening of vents\nin the walls of the rocket. This causes the pressure to drop and\nthus extinguishes the flame.\nIn the radar method of guidance, the launch vehicle carries\na radar beacon which continuously sends signals to the ground\ntelling its position. The brain in this case is a computer on the\nground. The ground computer compares the actual position of\nthe launch vehicle with the planned position, and sends radio\nimpulses to the vehicle\'s rockets to correct the position if the\nvehicle is off course.\nMid-Course Guidance\n\nThe inertial and radar systems are called "initial" guidance\nsystems, because they operate only to the point of injection. If\nthe spacecraft is on a planetary mission, it will need further\ncontrol en route to its destination. This is called "mid-course"\nguidance. For security reasons, some of the advanced methods\nof mid-course guidance cannot be discussed, but one important\nmethod is a system of automatic celestial navigation. This involves "shooting the stars" to determine position, in the manner\nthat a ship\'s captain navigates on the high seas. With very precise initial guidance, it is theoretically possible for a spacecraft\nto land, say, on Mars or Venus without mid-course guidance,\nbut even the slightest error in position or velocity would cause\na wide miss. For example, if the speed of the launch vehicle at\nthe point of injection was off by only one foot per second, the\nspacecraft would miss Venus by 25,000 miles. And one foot per\nsecond is a very tiny error when you consider that escape from\nEarth to Venus requires a speed of 38,000 feet per second.\n37\n\n0)\n\n00\n(0\nU)\n\n00\nC\n\nz\n0I\xe2\x80\x94\n\nW\n\n0)\nC\n-I LQ Z\nIL&JO\n\nEE\n\n/\n\n/\t\n\nON\r\nU) O(\\I\r\nUi m N\n\n(\n\nI\n\nw\n\nI\t\n\n<I.- ....-4\n- I\n\n4-.\nC\n\n10\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\xa2.c\nia-Z\t\na\n2E\nI <\nLU\nCf) Lo\n\n0)\n4-\n\n>\n\n0)\n4(0\n(I)\n\n>\nU)\nCM\n\n\xe2\x80\x942\n0 z\':\ncr 2\nD( E E\r\nco cli\r\nuJrZ\n0\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLO\nw\nto\ntn\t\n\n00\n\nU(.\n\nU) C\')\ni.\ncm\n\ncq\n\ntic\n\nU,\t\n\n00\n0\nU\n\nw 1,Oc\nzc\'\n\n0\nLL\ncr\t\n\nbe\n\nM\n\nt? >\n\nER\nI\n\nU)2\n- c.,J\n\nCL\n\nN\ncm\n\nU-J\t\n\nUi\n\n< co\no\n\nI(0\nU\n\n(0\n0.\n4\nU)\n(0\n0\nU\nU)\n\n0)\n00\n(0\n4U)\n\nU)\n0\n0\n.0\n\nI\n0\n\nq\n\n00\nC\n\nI0)\n4-.\n\nWL\n\n8\n\ncr\n\nE\n\nU\nC\n(0\n\nU\n\n2\n\n0)\n\nUi\n\n00\n(0\n\nUi\nIn -\n\nin\n\nI\n\n38\n\n2\n\n4..\nU,\n\n0 <>\n0\n2\n(U\n\n0)\n0)\nI4..\n(0\n\nco\n\n00\nC\n\nThe Launch Vehicle in Operation\n\nTo summarize the operation of the launch vehicle, let us\nreview what happens when a spacecraft is successfully placed\nin an orbit around the Earth at an altitude of one hundred miles.\nAt "lift-off," the start of the flight, the launch vehicle at first\nmoves "straight up," but gradually swings into a curved or parabolic flight path toward the point of injection. The gas escaping\nat high velocity from the rocket\'s exhaust nozzle provides the\nthrust, which accelerates the launch vehicle, moving it faster\nand faster along its path toward the point of injection. Meanwhile, the guidance system is constantly checking the position\nof the vehicle against the preplanned position, changing course\nwhen necessary by applying rocket thrust in the desired direction.\nSuppose that the point of injection is planned for an altitude of one hundred miles. As it approaches the hundred-mile\nlevel, the launch vehicle is moving at close to 18,000 miles per\nhour. Acting according to its program, the brain "decides" the\nvehicle has reached the proper altitude and the proper speed.\nIt shuts off the rocket power and actuates the mechanism which\nseparates the spacecraft from the launch vehicle. This separation can be accomplished in a number of ways. In the method\nmost often employed to date, small explosive charges shear the\nconnecting bolts that hold spacecraft and launch vehicle together and a series of springs push the spacecraft free. The\nspacecraft - now above the atmosphere which could slow it\ndown, and with Earth\'s gravity counterbalanced - continues in\norbit around the Earth. Depending on its own speed at the\npoint of separation, the launch vehicle may either follow the\nspacecraft into orbit or it may fall back toward Earth to burn\nup in the atmosphere.\nRocket Stages\n\nSo far, we have discussed the launch vehicle as a single\nrocket. In practice, it is customary to use more than one rocket\n39\n\nor stage. Since very high velocities are required for space\nflight, one rocket may not be able to boost the launch vehicle\nto required speed, so multistage vehicles are employed. In a\ntwo-stage rocket, for instance, one rocket is mounted atop\nanother, piggyback fashion. The first rocket fires for perhaps a\nminute, accelerating the entire vehicle to 10,000 feet per second. Having exhausted its fuel, it separates and falls back to\nEarth. The second rocket, ignited automatically, takes over and\nboosts the remaining portion of the vehicle an additional 10,000\nfeet per second. Since the vehicle started out at 10,000 feet per\nsecond, the net velocity is 20,000 feet per second. For greater\nspeeds, more stages can be added.\nThere is, however, a practical limit to the number of stages\nthat can be employed in one launch vehicle. Remember, each\nstage has an airframe, structure, and fuel tanks. These add up\nto a lot of weight. If too many stages were added, the first\nrocket would not have sufficient power to lift the total weight.\nA happy compromise is reached by making the upper stages\nprogressively smaller and lighter. Then the basic rocket starts\nthe vehicle moving and each successive stage makes its contribution to the over-all speed. The big advantage is in weight\nloss en route to space. As each rocket stage exhausts its fuel,\nit drops off, thus reducing the total weight of the launch vehicle and making the job easier for the succeeding rockets.\nMost launch vehicles have two, three, or four stages. In one\nspace launch made in April, 1961, a seven-stage vehicle was\nemployed!\nThrust can also be increased by using more than one\nrocket engine per stage, a technique called "clustering." If one\nrocket engine can deliver 50,000 pounds of thrust, three engines of the same type can deliver 150,000 pounds. The drawback, of course, is the need for additional tanks and propellants. These increase the weight of the launch vehicle, and in\nturn increase the amount of thrust required to boost it to the,\ndesired speed. Here again space-vehicle designers make the\n40\n\ncompromise between weight and thrust, selecting the combination of rocket engines and propellant weight which will produce maximum results in terms of launch-vehicle speed and\npayload. They may learn that for some space missions a single\nrocket engine is most efficient, while for other missions as many\nas eight engines may be clustered for greatest efficiency.\nThe launch vehicle is the carrier which thrusts the spacecraft into space. Next, we will see how the spacecraft accomplishes the mission for which it was designed - providing information to unlock the mysteries of the universe.\n\n41\n\nSpacecraft\n\nThe moment of lift-off! A Juno II,\nits body frosted because of cold\nliquid oxygen in its tanks, rises to\nplace a 90-pound ionosphere direct\nmeasuring satellite, Explorer VIII,\ninto orbit. Predawn launch was\nmade November 3, 1960.\n\nat Work\nNY spacecraft has a purpose. It is not merely a scientist\'s\ntoy, to be hurled into space for the sheer joy of proving\nit can be done. To send any object into space, manned or unmanned, requires large expenditures of time, effort, and money;\nand these expenditures would not be sanctioned if we didn\'t\nhope to derive some concrete benefits from the experiment.\nThe basic benefit, we have said, is knowledge. The knowledge gained may be used immediately to better man\'s way of\nlife in some manner.\nSpacecraft Categories\n\nSpacecraft may be broken down into two general categories: applied spacecraft and scientific spacecraft.\nApplied spacecraft are those in which space technology\nis put to work to provide immediate improvements in our\neveryday living. We have already discussed some examples weather and communications spacecraft, for instance.\nScientific spacecraft are those which seek purely scientific\ndata, which might be of great interest to the scientific corn-\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nmunity but which may not be applied immediately to a "better\nway of life." However, such data may be applicable at some\nfuture date in a manner not currently predictable. An example\nof a scientific spacecraft is an Earth satellite whose assignment\nis to study the density of the atmosphere.\nIn between these two general categories, there is a "gray\narea" embracing spacecraft which fit both categories. One example is a satellite which studies meteorites. This is basically\na scientific study, but it is also immediately applicable to problems of manned space flight. For example, a meteorite can\npuncture the hull of a spacecraft and endanger the lives of the\nastronauts. Thus, knowledge of the size, speed, and frequency\nof meteorites in space permits scientists to devise methods of\nprotection against them, so the scientific data can be applied\nto the design of spacecraft. In this example, scientific data is\napplied in the search for additional scientific data.\nTo understand the function of a spacecraft as a research\ntool, let us take a close look at how the spacecraft goes about\ncollecting information.\nFirst, let us consider a spacecraft of the sounding-rocket\nvariety, one which simply penetrates space for a brief period\nand returns to Earth.\nProject NERV\n\nIn September, 1960, scientists launched a sounding-rocket\nexperiment called NERV (Nuclear Emulsion Recovery Vehicle). Its mission was to study details of the mysterious cosmic radiation which originates in space. This radiation consists\nof billions of tiny charged particles which form into great radiation "belts" surrounding the Earth. Where the radiation level\nis intense, these particles can cause illness or even death to an\nunshielded human being moving through the radiation belts\nin a spacecraft. The existence of the radiation belts and some general information on their levels of intensity had been discovered by early U.S. Earth satellites.\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\nCutaway drawing of a NERV capsule, designed to be recovered after a space-probe mission. NERV investigates\ncosmic ray activity.\nHowever, scientists wanted more detailed information on\nthe number of these particles, the amount of charge, how fast\nthey move, and in what direction. This information is valuable\nin determining the amount of shielding necessary for manned\nspacecraft.\nTo get the information, they designed a bell-shaped capsule about sixteen inches long and nineteen inches in diameter,\n45\n\nweighing slightly more than eighty pounds. In it they placed\ntwenty-five sheets of nuclear emulsion, a thick photographic\nfilm coated with an emulsion sensitive to charged particles.\nThe goal was to take "pictures" of the particles by recording\ntheir tracks across the sensitive emulsion. Analysis of the pictures would reveal the desired information about the number\nof particles, their speed, direction, and amount of charge.\nRecording Radiation\n\nThe capsule was the spacecraft. Its launch vehicle was a\nfour-stage sounding rocket called Argo D-8. Each of the four\nstages was propelled by a solid-fuel rocket. The launch vehicle\nboosted the small NERV capsule to an altitude of 1,260 miles.\nThen the launch vehicle and capsule together dropped to the\ntop of the atmosphere, where the capsule was ejected. As it\npassed through the radiation belts on the way up and again on\nthe way down, the spacecraft trapped the charged particles\nthrough a porthole in the capsule, and the photographic emulsion made a precise record of the amount of radiation.\nThe film had to be processed. in order to develop the\nidentifying tracks made by the particles - the clues for scientific\nstudy. Thus, completion of the experiment required recovery\nof the spacecraft. The capsule was provided with an automatic\nparachute, which opened at the proper time to lower the spacecraft to Earth. To assist its recovery, the capsule also had a\nradio beacon that sent out signals to trackers on the ground as\nit descended from space. The capsule and its valuable film\nwere recovered and sent to the laboratories for detailed\nanalysis.\nNERV is typical of a great many experiments performed\nby spacecraft of the sounding-rocket type. In these experiments,\nthe spacecraft is not aIways recovered; sometimes the information is radioed back to Earth during the period of time that the\nvehicle is in space.\nThe Earth-orbiting satellite is usually a more complex\n46\n\nspacecraft than the payload of a sounding rocket. Most scientific satellites are designed to perform, not one, but a number\nof experiments as the spacecraft circles the Earth. Each experiment requires a different instrument or set of instruments, so\nthe number of experiments which can be made depends on the\namount of payload which can be sent aloft. This in turn is dependent upon the amount of thrust available in the launching\nvehicle.\nEven some of the smaller satellites, however, are capable\nof handling several different experiments. American scientists\nhave made considerable progress in "miniaturizing" the datarecording instruments that go into a satellite. In this manner,\ninstruments are made smaller without impairing their reliability. For example, a relatively small satellite called Explorer VII\nweighs only 91.5 pounds. Shaped like two cones joined together\nat their bases, it is thirty inches in diameter. Yet, within this\nsmall space, it contains instruments to carry out seven different\nexperiments, together with other equipment to collect the data\nand transmit it back to Earth.\nLet\'s examine Explorer VII as an illustration of how an\nEarth satellite performs its assignment.\nExplorer VII was boosted into space by a four-stage launch\nvehicle called Juno II. It went into an elliptical orbit with a\nperigee (point closest to Earth) of 344 miles altitude and an\napogee (point most distant from Earth) of 678 miles altitude.\nIt will remain in orbit for about twenty years.\nExplorer Vii\'s experiments were concerned primarily with\nradiation, so before discussing how the satellite acquired information, let us first discuss radiation.\nElectromagnetic Radiation\n\nIn the vacuum of space, there are many different types of\nradiation. Generally, they are banded together under the heading "electromagnetic radiation." Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation; as are radiated heat, radio and radar waves,\n47\n\nX rays and gamma rays. What is the difference among them?\nRadiation is classified by "wave length," ranging from very\nlong waves to very short waves. The total range is called the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. Take an ordinary twelve-inch ruler\nand imagine it is the electromagnetic spectrum. At the lefthand side of the ruler are the long-wave radiations. Roughly\nhalf of the ruler, or spectrum, is taken up by various types of\nradio waves - such as the radio used in aircraft or satellites,\nyour standard home radio, television, and radar.\nAs we progress toward the other end of the ruler, the wave\nlengths become shorter. After radar comes infrared radiation.\nThen, at about the seven-inch mark on the ruler, comes visible\nlight. Visible light is a very tiny portion of the total spectrum;\nif we assume the ruler to be the total spectrum, visible light\nwould occupy only about one sixteenth of an inch. Still moving\ntoward the shorter wave lengths, after visible light we come to\nultraviolet rays, X rays, and gamma rays. All of this radiation\nmoves through space at approximately the speed of light, which\nis now computed to be 186,300 miles per second.\nCosmic rays are a different type of radiation, in that they\nconsist of very tiny particles, actually nuclei of some of the\nlighter elements such as hydrogen.\nOnly a very small portion of the total electromagnetic\nspectrum penetrates the layer of atmosphere which surrounds\nthe Earth; visible light does, of course, and so do certain portions of the radio part of the spectrum. When cosmic radiation\nenters our atmosphere, its character changes; so to study it\nproperly we must study it in space, its native habitat.\nScientists are very much interested in every type of radiation present in space - its amount, its energy, its source, and\nother details which are tiny parts of the jigsaw puzzle of the\nuniverse and its origins. With spacecraft, scientists now have\ntools with which to explore these phenomena.\nSince the experiments in Explorer VII were concerned with\nradiation of one type or another, let\'s see how the satellite went\n48\n\nAn engineer makes a final inspection of the 91.5-pound Explorer VII\nEarth satellite. Even a very small satellite is complex, as the inset\nview of Explorer\'s main electronic chassis indicates.\n\nabout collecting the information scientists needed to have.\nExperiment Number One was concerned with the thermal\nradiation balance, or "heat budget" of our Earth. The sun is i\ngigantic nuclear reactor pouring energy throughout the solar\nsystem. Only two billionths of the sun\'s total energy output\nreaches Earth. Some of this energy is absorbed as heat; some\nOf it is reflected, or bounced back, into space. The Earth receives the greatest amount of heat from the sun at the Equator,\nand correspondingly less toward the North and South Poles.\nHowever, scientists have determined that at the poles the Earth\nreflects and radiates more heat than is received there. This\nmeans that some of the heat being received at the middle latitudes is being transferred to the poles by the atmosphere and\nby ocean currents. This transfer of heat has great influence on\nour weather, and scientists want to know more about it. The\nquestions "asked" of Explorer VII were these:\n1) How much heat radiation from the sun fails on the\n"top" of our atmosphere?\n2) How much of it is reflected back into space?\n3) How much of it is absorbed by the Earth, its clouds, and\nits atmosphere?\nBy comparing the respective data, scientists can chart the\namount of "heat transfer" on Earth.\nSensing Elements\n\nTo measure the various factors, Explorer VII was equipped\nwith a number of "sensing elements." The sensors were hemispherical in shape and about the size of half a golf ball. They\nwere located on the outer surface of the satellite, where they\nwould encounter the different types of radiation from the sun\nand from the Earth. Some were painted black; these were\nequally sensitive to radiation from the sun and to radiation\nfrom the Earth. Others were painted white; these were more\nsensitive to radiation from Earth than that from the sun.\nAnother, with a polished gold surface, was more sensitive to\n50\n\nradiation from the sun than to the radiation "bounced" back\nfrom Earth.\nEach of the sensors was equipped with a small electric\nthermometer, and the temperature recorded was an indication\nof the amount of radiation present. In a very complicated series\nof calculations comparing the data recorded by each of the\nsensors, scientists- can get the answers to the questions asked\nof Explorer VII.\nMeasuring the Sun\'s Radiation\n\nExperiment Number Two was concerned with measuring\nsome of the electromagnetic radiation we just discussed, in this\ncase radiation coming from the sun. Specifically, Explorer VII\nwas "asked" to measure X rays and ultraviolet rays, short-wave\nportions of the spectrum.\nThe satellite was equipped with two small cylinders, each\nabout the size of a three-inch flashlight battery. The cylinders\nwere filled with special gases that can detect the presence of\nradiation. One cylinder was designed to measure X rays and\nthe other to measure solar ultraviolet radiation, the invisible\nlight that can cause sunburn. Each cylinder had a window,\nmounted in the outer shell of the satellite. The radiation entered the window and was trapped by the gas. The amount of\nradiation present was then measured by the change in the\nelectrical properties of the gas.\nExperiment Number Three was a measurement of heavy\nprimary cosmic rays, which are atoms stripped of their electrons so that just the nuclei are left. They are tiny particles\nrather than rays, with tremendously high amounts of energy. A\ngiant atom smasher, such as is used in scientific work, may have\nthe power of one billion electron volts; but these heavy primary cosmic rays have energies as high as a billion billion electron volts. To measure their intensity, another gas-filled cylinder similar to that used for X-ray and ultraviolet radiation\nwas employed.\n51\n\nExperiment Number Four involved measurement of some\nof the less energetic particles in the great radiation belts\naround Earth. These particles can be harmful to human life;\nand since manned spacecraft will have to pass through the radiation zone, measurement of the intensity and energy of these\nis important. The measurements were made by equipment similar in principle to, but slightly different from, the cylindrical\nchambers used in Experiment Number Three.\nSolar Cells\n\nThe performance of the solar cell was the subject of Experiment Number Five in Explorer VII. This solar cell was a\nspecially fabricated crystal window coated with silicon, which\ntraps radiation from the sun. All radiation is a form of energy,\nand this energy can be trapped and put to work. In advanced\nspacecraft, solar energy may be used to power the spacecraft.\nIn current satellites, it is used to provide power for the radiosending equipment, which transmits the information back to\nEarth. The solar cell or window catches radiant energy from\nthe sun and converts it into electrical potential or voltage to\npower the satellite\'s radio transmitter.\nMost of the surface of Explorer VII was covered with these\nsmall windows to obtain power. For Experiment Number Five,\none cell had special equipment to measure the variations in\nvoltage over a long period. The object was to study the performance of the cell to see how long and how well it functioned\nin the presence of radiation.\nMicrometeorites\t\n\nS\t\n\n-\n\nExperiment Number Six dealt with micrometeorites which,\nas their name implies, are very tiny meteors or particles of cosmic dust smaller than grains of sand. Of unknown origin, micrometeorites hurtle through space at speeds from 25,000 to\nmore than 150,000 miles per hour. They are of interest scientifically because of the mystery of their origin. They are also of\n52\n\npractical interest, since, traveling at such speeds, they could\ndevelop enough momentum to puncture the hull of a manned\nspacecraft.\nIn this experiment, scientists "asked" Explorer VII to find\nout how often micrometeorites are encountered in spate. Some\nindication can be obtained by measuring how many times they\nstruck the satellite. The satellite was equipped with three\n"photoconductors" covered by film shutters of extremely thin\naluminum. The photoconductor and shutter work like a camera - a micrometeorite punctures the film shutter, letting in\nlight, and the photoconductor records the impact of the\nparticle.\nExperiment Number Seven, the final experiment of Explorer VII, was simply a measurement of the temperature on\nthe surface of the satellite. As Explorer VII moved in orbit\naround the Earth, it was sometimes in direct sunlight unfiltered\nby the atmosphere, at other times it was in cosmic darkness as\nit moved behind the Earth. Temperatures were measured by\nelectric thermometers. Explorer VII reported that satellite\ntemperatures ranged between 32 degrees Fahrenheit, when\nEarth was between the satellite and the sun, and 140 degrees\nFahrenheit when Explorer VII was in direct sunlight.\nSending Space Data to Earth\n\nSuch were the experiments and the equipment in Explorer VII. Now, how did the satellite send the information\nback to Earth?\nIt is possible to design unmanned spacecraft which can\nreturn to Earth, their instruments and records intact. Explorer\nVII, however, was not one of this type. It will circle the Earth\nfor another two decades, gradually slowing down as it makes\ncontact with the few atmospheric particles which are found\nin its orbit When it slows down sufficiently, gravity will take\nover and the spacecraft will plunge into the heavier atmosphere, where it will burn up as a result of atmospheric friction.\n53\n\nExplorer VII must send its information from space. The system\n\nby which this is accomplished is called telemetry.\nTelemetry is simply radio communication from the spacecraft to a receiving station on Earth. It requires one or more\ntransmitters in the satellite and a source of transmitter power.\nTelemetry might be compared to a radio broadcast. An\nannouncer talks into a microphone. The microphone converts\nthe sound waves generated by his voice into electrical impulses\nwhich are beamed through the-air on a certain frequency. By\ntuning your home radio to that frequency, you pick up these\nsignals, and the receiver in your radio converts the signals back\nto audible sound.\nTo describe telemetry from a spacecraft, let us take a\nspecific example, such as the micrometeorite experiment in\nExplorer VII. A micrometeorite punctures the aluminum-covered window on the surface. of the spacecraft and the impact is\nregistered. An electrical system "tells" the transmitter of the\nimpact, and the transmitter immediately sends a signal to the\nreceiving station on Earth, which is tuned to the special frequency assigned to Explorer VII.\n- At the station, this signal is recorded on a reel of magnetic.\ntape. Each different type of experiment - cosmic rays, heat balance, temperature, X rays, and so forth - makes a different type\nof coded mark on the tape. The times at which these marks\nare made are also recorded on the tape. Later, scientists can\ntake the tapes and decode them. They relate the information\nreceived to the known position of the satellite at the time it was\nrecorded, and make the calculations and measurements which\nproduce the desired scientific information. The scientists are\naided in this painstaking analysis of the tapes by electronic\ncomputers, which handle in seconds the calculations it might\ntake men months to make. Even so, analysis of a taped satellitedata record is a long process, sometimes requiring many\nmonths.\nTo send the signals, the transmitter needs power. In Ex54\n\nplorer VII, a combination of batteries and solar cells were employed. The solar cells converted radiant energy from the sun\ninto electric power for the transmitter. However, Explorer VII\nwas not always in sunlight; as it passed behind the Earth, it\ncould not pick up solar radiation. So, to permit sending data\nduring this dark period, the transmitter was provided with a\npair of storage batteries for power. Alternately, solar energy\ntook over again. The solar cells charged the batteries during the\ndaylight sector of its orbit.\nThat is the basic system of telemetry used for Explorer\nVII. There are several variations of the system, however. One\nof the drawbacks of the Explorer VII equipment was that the\nsatellite could send information only when it was over or near\na receiving station. These stations are located at various points\non the Earth\'s surface, but even so there were times when the\nsatellite was "out of sight" of all stations. .Thus, some of the information transmitted was never recorded.\nAdvanced Telemetry\n\nTo overcome this deficiency, a more advanced system was\ndeveloped. In this system, the spacecraft itself can be equipped\nwith one or more tape recorders. As data from each of the experiments is obtained, it is recorded on tape and stored until\nthe satellite i within range of a receiving station. At that time,\noperators in the station can "ask" the satellite for all or any\nspecific part of its stored information by sending a radio signal.\nThe tape recorder then plays back its stored information, which\nis relayed to Earth by the transmitter.\nTelevision is also used in spacecraft-to-Earth communications when a photographic record is desirable, such as a photo\nof the cloud cover of the Earth. The image recorded by the\nspace camera is converted to electrical impulses, relayed to\nEarth by the transmitter, and "unscrambled" into a picture at\nthe receiving station.\nWe have discussed the methods of operation of two types\n55\n\nof spacecraft, the sounding rocket and the Earth satellite. The\nthird type is the space probe, a spacecraft which goes to the\nvicinity of a specific planet, or moves in an orbit between planets. There have not been, many interplanetary probes to date,\nbut one of the most successful and most fascinating was Pio-\n\nneer V.\n\nAn Interplanetary Spacecraft in Operation\n\nPioneer V was designed to orbit around the sun between\nthe orbits of Venus and Earth. To get an idea of the path of\nthe spacecraft, mark a dot on a piece of paper and draw two\nconcentric circles around it. The dot is the sun. The circle\nclosest to the dot is the orbit of Venus. The outer circle is\nEarth\'s orbit. Draw an ellipse lying between the two circles\nand that, roughly, is the path of Pioneer V. It is in orbit around\nthe sun, a tiny man-made planet, making one orbit of 514,000,000 miles every 312 days.\nIn order to go into solar orbit, Pioneer V first had to escape\nfrom Earth\'s gravity. This was accomplished by a powerful\nthree-stage Thor-Able launch vehicle, which boosted the spacecraft to a speed of about 25,000 miles per hour. At this speed,\nthe outward push was greater than the pull of Earth\'s gravity,\nso Pioneer V left Earth forever: As it escaped Earth, it came\nunder the influence of the sun\'s gravity, which accelerated the\nspacecraft to a speed of 78,000 miles per hour. This speed is\nsufficient to keep Pioneer V in solar orbit forever, in the same\nmanner that Earth itself remains in solar orbit.\nPioneer V is a beach-ball-size sphere, twenty-six inches in\ndiameter, weighing ninety-five pounds. From its "equator"\xe2\x80\x94\nthe centerline of the sphere - extend four large paddles. Each\nof these paddles contains 1,200 solar cells, a total of 4,800 cells\nwhich continuously charge fourteen small batteries. The batteries power two transmitters. The telemetry system is of the\ncommand type; that is, the spacecraft sends signals in response\nto command signals from Earth. Pioneer V sent back informa56\n\ntion from a point 22,500,000 miles from Earth, which was an\nextraordinary accomplishment. Then, since its transmitter did\nnot have sufficient power to send signals over the greater distances involved, it was heard no more.\nPioneer V\'s Experiments\n\nThe equipment aboard Pioneer V was designed to make\nfour experiments. The experiments were similar to those in\nExplorer VII and performed in similar manner, but of course\nthe data were different because Pioneer V is operating in interplanetary space, millions of miles from Earth, while Explorer\nVII is orbiting close to Earth.\n\nSOME\nNOMMEMME\n\n0910MMMM\n_1111\n\xe2\x80\xa2w rnrnuun\nMOMMMOMMAM\nMMWMMMMH\nrnirnrnu\nThe initial path of interplanetary probe Pioneer V between the orbits\nof Earth and Venus. Radio contact with Pioneer V lasted until probe\nwas more than 22,500,000 miles from Earth, setting a record.\n57\n\nPioneer V had a counter to measure solar radiation. This\n\nconsisted of seven gas-filled chambers such as those described\nfor Explorer VII. It also had two chambers to measure the distribution of cosmic rays in deep space. It had a device called\na "magnetometer," which measured the magnetic force in the\ngreat magnetic fields surrounding Earth and in interplanetary\nspace. Finally, it had a micrometeorite counter. It is interesting\nto note that, although Pioneer V had moved a million miles into\nspace in the first seven days of its endless journey, it had recorded only eighty-seven micrometeorite hits.\nThese three spacecraft - NERV, the sounding rocket, Explorer VII, the Earth satellite, and Pioneer V, the interplanetary\nprobe - are representative of their various classes. However, it\nmust be remembered that they are relatively crude products\nof the "Stone Age" of space exploration. Already, much more\nadvanced spacecraft are ready for use. Instruments of greater\ncapability, or "sophistication" as scientists term it, are being\ndeveloped. They will be capable of collecting and transmitting\nback to Earth a much wider variety of space data. As more\npowerful launch vehicles become available, the spacecraft will\nbecome much larger and will take on different shapes, depending on their assigned missions. Communications systems will be\ndeveloped to permit receipt of information from greater distances which will make even Pioneer V\'s 22,500,000-mile transmission seem insignificant. Spacecraft will be designed to\nmaneuver in space, to change their speed or orbit, to circle or\nland on other planets. It is even possible that someday we may\nsend a spacecraft to retrieve Pioneer V from its lonely orbit for\nscientific study.\nIn later chapters we will discuss these advanced spacecraft. First, however, let us examine the manned spacecraft,\nwhat it can do and what new designs and equipment are\nneeded to permit man to survive and operate in the alien environment of space.\n58\n\nMail\n\nin\nSpace\nHE real conquest of space demands that man himself\nT venture out into the void beyond our atmosphere. The\nautomatic instruments in unmanned spacecraft are masterpieces of modern technology, but they are no match for nature\'s masterpiece, the human brain.\nOccasionally, the argument is advanced that instrumented\nspacecraft can obtain all the desired information about space.\nMost experts concerned with space exploration will disagree.\nAs sophisticated as the most advanced instruments are, they\ncan only report; they cannot evaluate what they "see." In the\nquest for scientific knowledge, the best possible combination\nof research tools is man and the instruments.\nFinally, there is the philosophical aspect of space exploration. After dreaming for countless centuries of leaving his\nplanet to explore the universe, can man now forego the opportunity presented by modern technology simply because it\nis expensive and dangerous? It will be expensive, certainly,\nbut the potential result justifies the expense. And danger has\n\nCHAPTER ii\n\nnever been a deterrent to pioneers, from Columbus to the\nWright brothers.\nMan will venture farther into space. He has already\ndemonstrated his ability to survive in space if provided with\nthe proper protection. True, the first maimed space flights\nwere of relatively brief duration. Nevertheless, they proved\nthat man has already solved at least some of the basic problems of human survival in the alien environment of space. The\nproblem will increase in proportion to the distance man moves\nfrom Earth and the time he spends in space. However, clear\nlines of solution are already evident.\nProtection for Man in Space\n\nThe manned spacecraft is necessarily a more complex\nvehicle than its unmanned counterpart. The basic mechanics\nof thrusting the craft into space are the same. The types of\nspacecraft\xe2\x80\x94sounding rockets, Earth satellites, and space probes\nof the lunar, planetary, and interplanetary varieties\xe2\x80\x94are the\nsame. The complexity stems from the efforts to provide protection so that man can exist in a totally unfamiliar and challenging environment.\nThe best available illustration of what is involved in the\nconstruction of a manned spacecraft can be had by examining\nthe systems and equipment in the Project Mercury capsule\nwhich took the first U.S. astronauts into space. Compared with\ntomorrow\'s spacecraft, the Mercury capsule is a "Model T" of\nthe Space Age, yet it contains the basic systems for human\nsurvival and it has proved that they work. The Mercury capsule, shaped like a large bell, is about six feet wide at its\nbottom and about ten feet long. Although tiny by comparison\nwith spacecraft to come, it is considerably larger than most of\nthe early U.S. satellites and space probe payloads. The Mercury\ncapsule weighs about two tons and the major portion of its\nweight is taken up by equipment designed to protect its occupant.\n60\n\nAS\n\nROM SUIT\n\nTO SUIT\n\nER\nBER\n\nHEAT EXCHANGER\n\nA cutaway drawing of the "life support" system used with an\nastronaut\'s space suit. It provides him with purified, pressurized air, and can function for up to 28 hours. The space\ncapsule\'s cabin has still another system.\n\nThe cabin is designed, as nearly as possible, to duplicate\nenvironmental conditions of the surface of the Earth, to which\nman is adapted. First, the astronaut must have oxygen to\nbreathe. He must also be provided with an atmospheric pressure close to that of Earth; otherwise at the very low pressures\nof space his blood would boil. Beneath the couch on which the\nastronaut lies during flight are two tanks, each containing\nfour pounds of oxygen. A pump forces the oxygen into the\n61\n\ncabin, in much the same manner that airliners are "pressurized"\nso that the passengers can breathe normally at altitudes where\noutside air is much too thin for normal breathing.\nThe Mercury Space Suit\n\nTo permit the astronaut to perform his functions in comfort, the temperature in the cabin is carefully controlled by a\ntype of air conditioner called a "heat exchanger." Hot air from\nthe cabin is drawn into this heat exchanger by a fan, cooled by\nwater, and directed back into the cabin. This system keeps the\nMercury capsule comfortable even during the "hot" period\nwhen the capsule re-enters the dense atmosphere and air friction builds up enormously high. temperatures on the outside of\nthe capsule.\nBesides being protected by the cabin pressure system, the\nFinding a heat shield for Project Mercury\'s\n\n62\n\nastronaut wears a space suit. This is no ordinary flying suit; it\nis actually a compact version of the cabin. A hose leads from\nthe oxygen tanks to the waist of the space suit. Should something go wrong with the cabin pressure, an automatic device\nimmediately starts pumping air into the suit to provide breath ing air and adequate pressure. The suit also has its own airconditioning system similar to the one which cools the cabin.\nAs he breathes, the astronaut exhales carbon dioxide,\nwhich can be poisonous if sufficient quantities are allowed to\naccumulate. Also, he perspires and gives off body odors. The\noxygen stream entering the suit picks up the carbon dioxide,\nwater vapor from perspiration, and body odors and exhausts\nthem through an exit hose in the helmet of the suit. They pass\nthrough a chemical canister which removes the carbon dioxide\nand body odors, then through a "water evaporator," a spongecapsule: a Fiberglas and plastic model takes blast of 5,000\xc2\xb0F. air stream.\n\nAstronaut\'s space suit provides an\nenvironment approaching that of\nEarth. He is protected against low\npressure, heat. Body reactions can\nbe measured and monitored.\n\n64\n\nlike device that absorbs the water. The purified oxygen stream\nis directed back into the suit for\nre-use.\nAll of these systems work\nautomatically, and each system\nhas a "back-up" system - if one\nsystem fails the other automatically starts operating. The astronaut\'s instrument panel tells\nhim how each part of the system is working. All of this intricate equipment is located under\nthe foam-rubber couch on\nwhich the astronaut lies during\nflights. Despite its complexity, it\ntakes up little more space than\nthe simple system which operates your family refrigerator.\nIn addition to these protective devices, the capsule also has\na two-way radio, permitting\nconversation between the astronaut and the ground stations.\nTelemetering equipment transnuts data on the astronaut\'s\nphysical condition to a physician at the ground station. Wires\nare affixed to various parts of the\nastronaut\'s body and connected\nto the telemetry transmitter. In\nthis way, his heart beat, breathing rate, pulse, body temperature, and other important physiologic details are observed.\n\nTo keep the spacecraft from spinning or going end over\nend, small jets are mounted on the capsule. The astronaut fires\nthese jets by moving a control handle. The jet blast moves\nthe capsule up and down or from side to side. The tiny jets produce only a few pounds of thrust, but that is all that is required in space where there is no air resistance to overcome.\nReturning the Manned Spacecraft to Earth\n\nUnlike the unmanned satellite, which can be permitted to\nburn up in the atmosphere when its usefulness is ended, the\nmanned spacecraft must be brought safely back to Earth. This\nrequires a new set of devices. Here again we will use the Mercury capsule as an illustration.\nThe first requirement is to slow down the spacecraft to\nbring it out of orbit. This is accomplished by small "retro\nrockets," located at the bottom of the capsule (actually the\nfront end as the capsule moves in orbit, because the capsule\nchanges position after launch). When these rockets are fired\ntoward the line of ffight, they act like the brakes in an automobile and produce a force opposite to the directionof movement. The retro rockets may be triggered either by the astronaut or by the ground station.\nAs the retro rockets slow down the capsule, the balance\nbetween velocity and gravity is destroyed and the spacecraft\ndrops Earthward. Now comes the critical "re-entry." Although\nthe capsule has lost some of its orbital velocity, it is still moving at a terrific rate - 10,000 to 15,000 miles per hour. At this\nspeed contact between capsule and even very thin air builds\nup great friction which would destroy the capsule if protection\nwere not provided. The protection is a "heat shield," a heavy\nlayer of Fiberglas on the bottom of the capsule, which strikes\nthe atmosphere first. A part of this shield actually melts from\nthe friction heat. Melting is a change of state requiring large\namounts of heat. Thus, the heat energy is absorbed so that it\ndoes not spread to the other parts of the capsule.\n65\n\nAfter re-entry, the capsule slows down more and more\nfrom air resistance. When it drops to about 10,000 feet altitude,\nit still is moving at a few hundred miles per hour - much too\nfast for a landing impact. To slow the spacecraft further, a large\nparachute pops from the top of the capsule. To cushion the\nlanding impact even more, there is a large rubber cushion between the heat shield and the cabin. This automatically inflates\nlike a balloon and permits a gentle "touch-down."\nSuch, in brief, are the major systems in the Project Mercury spacecraft. It is apparent that there are a great many\nfactors to be considered in the design of a manned spacecraft,\neven a "Model T" spacecraft like the Mercury capsule. Remember, the Mercury system is designed to put only one man\nin space for a period of not more than twenty-eight hours. The\ndesign problems and survival requirements are compounded\nmany times for manned spacecraft capable of performing advanced space missions, such as a landing on the moon or a visit\nto another planet.\nLet us consider some of the design requirements for more\nadvanced manned space missions.\nManned Spacecraft after Mercury\n\nNext step after Mercury is the "multi-man" spacecraft,\ncapable of orbiting the Earth as a space laboratory for periods\nof about fourteen days, or of making a trip around the moon\nwithout landing. In this type of spacecraft, all of the protection\nbuilt into the Mercury capsule must be applied on a larger\nscale. These spacecraft will have a crew of three, so the cabin\nwill have to have provision for pressurization, breathing oxygen,\ntemperature control, and waste elimination for three men for\nfourteen days instead of one man for one day. This can be\naccomplished by "recycling" the various materials, using them\nover and over. Take oxygen for instance. In the body, inhaled\noxygen is converted to carbon dioxide; the exhaled carbon dioxide can be reconverted to oxygen and carbon by a chemical\n66\n\nsystem. The oxygen can then be recycled for breathing.\nIn order to eliminate the large fleet needed for sea-search\nand recovery, the Mefcury system of landing in the ocean will\nbe scrapped in favor of landing at a preselected site on land.\nThis means that the craft will have to have some form of aerodynamic lift built into its design, together with controls for\nmaneuvering in the atmosphere, like an airplane. The single\nMercury landing parachute will not suffice for the heavier\nmulti-man spacecraft. It must have at least two parachutes,\nor a vertical descent system such as a helicopter\'s rotor blades.\nThere must be provision for storing food, which takes up\nspace and weight even in the most condensed form. The spacecraft also must carry equipment for emergency repairs, since\nthe chance of an emergency increases with the duration of the\nvoyage.\nObviously, a major requirement is greatly increased thrust\nin the launch vehicle, due to the heavier weight of the spacecraft.\nLunar Spacecraft\n\nAs we progress to the next step, manned landing on the\nmoon, we encounter a new set of design problems. All of the\nprevious considerations apply, but there are additional requirements.\nFirst, there must be an extremely powerful launch vehicle\nto start the spacecraft on its trip to the moon. Then, the spacecraft must have an advanced guidance system to reach the\nmoon and maneuver into position for a landing. It must have\npowerful retro rockets to cushion the landing on the moon.\nIf the astronauts will venture out of their spacecraft onto\nthe atmosphereless surface of the moon, a very advanced type\nof space suit will be required. All of the protection provided by\nthe complicated equipment in the spacecraft must be built\ninto the suit itself.\nTo leave the moon and return to Earth, more rocket power\n67\n\nIon engines may provide power for deep-space exploration.\nIn prototype, above, nitrogen atoms, ionized in 3,000 volt arc,\nare "pinched" in magnetic field and expelled at 100,000 mph.\nThrust is low, but if applied over long periods produces high\nvelocities. Engine may work for years.\n68\n\nis needed. Escape from the moon is easier than escape from\nEarth, since the moon\'s gravitational force is only one-sixth\nas great as Earth\'s. Nonetheless, to propel a large spacecraft\naway from the moon, powerful rockets and large quantities of\nfuel are needed, as well as a very precise guidance system to\nplace the spacecraft in the proper path for a return to Earth.\nRe-entry into Earth\'s atmosphere from a moon trip requires\ngreater heat shielding, because of higher re-entry speed.\nInterplanetary Spacecraft\n\nWhen we think of interplanetary travel even to the nearest\nplanets, the problems become enormous. Once again we need\npressurization, breathing oxygen, temperature control, waste\nelimination systems, and recycling systems; but they must\nfunction perfectly for much longer periods of time. At escape\nvelocity of 26,000 miles an hour, a round trip to Venus, our\nnearest neighbor, will take about three months. Almost four\nmonths are required for a round trip to Mars, and more than\nfive months for a round trip to Mercury. Thus, every component of the spacecraft must operate reliably for months, and\nnumerous "back-up" systems will be required to take over, in\nthe event of failure.\nIn discussing lunar voyages, we passed lightly over the\nradiation problem. From data produced by the early spacecraft,\nscientists are charting radiation space maps which show where\nthe danger areas lie. In Earth-orbiting missions, it will be possible to avoid these radiation belts or to pass quickly through\nthem at the point of their weakest intensity. For lunar or interplanetary missions, however, radiation protection will have\nto be built into the spacecraft, because of the long duration of\nthe voyage and the probability of encountering a solar storm,\nduring which radiation reaches its highest levels.\nSimilarly, there must be protection against the possibility\nof a hull puncture by a meteorite, since long periods in space\nincrease the chance of a strike.\n69\n\nEarly manned space flights have indicated that periods of\nweightlessness are not a problem for short periods. No one yet\nknows whether weightlessness is a problem when the condition\nexists for months. It could, for instance, cause astronauts to become disoriented so that they could not perform jobs. It may\neven cause them to become ill. The interplanetary spacecraft\nwill probably have to have its own artificial gravity to combat\nthis problem. Artificial gravity can be induced by rotating the\ncraft in flight, but this poses still more design problems.\nCommunications with Earth are very important and they\nbecome a problem because of the distances involved. Radio sets\nhave been developed which can operate up to 50,000,000 miles\nfrom Earth, but this is a trifling distance if we are ever to explore space in the region of the outer planets. Jupiter, for instance, is about 387,000,000 miles from Earth; Uranus, more\nthan 1.6 billion miles; Neptune and Pluto, more than three billion miles!\nThese are just some of the basic problem areas connected\nwith the development of manned spacecraft. There are a great\nmany more specific problems. Even the briefest r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 of the\nareas of difficulty serves to illustrate why manned space exploration will take a long time, a great deal of research and\nlarge sums of money.\nNonetheless, manned exploration of the solar system will\ncome, in time. For some of the problems, solutions are already\nin development; for others, solutions appear possible. In a later\nchapter, we will discuss advanced space missions and the lines\nof approach toward solving these problems.\n\n70\n\nLaunch Vehicles\nfor\nFuture\nSpace Missions\nHROUGHOUT the early chapters of this book, there has\nT been one recurrent fact: The weight of the spacecraft\nis limited by the power available in the launch vehicle. To\nreach space, the spacecraft must be blasted through the layer\nof atmosphere which rings Earth, fighting the drag of the billions of tiny air molecules which tend to retard the progress of\nthe space vehicle. At the same time, the space vehicle must\ndevelop sufficient velocity so that it overpowers the force of\nEarth\'s gravity which tends to pull any object toward the center of Earth.\nThis takes power, or rocket thrust. The amount of thrust\nrequired to put a payload in space cannot be stated in a simple\nequation. It depends upon a number of factors. In every\nlaunch - regardless of mission - the weight of the spacecraft\nand the size and weight of the launch vehicle must be considered. If the spacecraft is an Earth-orbiting vehicle, the desired\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nC\n\nLII\n\nM-1\n\naltitude of orbit is a factor, as is\nthe distance from Earth, if it is\na deep space probe. Generally,\nit can be stated that the farther\nthe spacecraft is to move from\nEarth, the greater the propulsion requirement, since longdistance spacecraft are necessarily larger and heavier.\nAssuming that any space\nexperiment starts from Earth\n(later we will cover another\npossibility), the types of missions that can be performed\nhinge largely on the power\navailable in the launch vehicles.\nInitially, all launch vehicles\nwere modified guided missiles.\nLater, launch vehicles especially designed for space work were\ndeveloped Now there is a largescale U S effort to develop a series of space launchers of everincreasing power. These vehicles cannot be developed overnight. They require intense\n\nReady to go: just before launch,\nthe Echo satellite\'s Delta rocket\nvents a cloud of excess liquid oxygen. Echo, a 100-foot aluminized\nMylar plastic sphere, was the first\npassive communications satellite.\nIt was orbited August 12, 1960.\n\n0\n\nsearch and engineering effort,\nlong periods of test, modifications based on tests, great expenditures of labor and money.\nAlthough lunar and interplanetary exploration, particularly in manned spacecraft, hold\nthe most fascination for the lay\nobserver, there is still a need to\nboost smaller payloads into\nEarth orbit or near-space. The\napplied satellites in the fields of\ncommunication, weather forecasting, navigation, and military\nsurveillance must still be perfected. In addition, there is still\nmuch to learn about our own\nEarth and close-in space.\nFor these closer missions, a\nseries of relatively small launch\nvehicles has been developed.\nThese vehicles have been given\nnames by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\nwhich directs the U.S. space\nprogram\n\nFOLDED\nLECHO\n- 1 SATELLITE\nSOLIDPROPELLANT\nMOTOR\n\nGUIDANCE I\nANTENNA\n\n9 1\t\n\n2ND-STAGE\nFUEL TANKS\n\nENGINE\n\n1ST-STAGE\nFUEL TANK\n\nCutaway shows 92-foot, three-stage\nDelta launch vehicle for Echo\nsatellite.

It has\n115,000 pounds of thrust in its first, or bottom, stage; 55,000\npounds in the second stage; about 14,000 pounds in the third\nstage; and 8,000 pounds in the fourth, or top, stage. Although it\nis the smallest of the modern launch vehicles, Scout is seventytwo feet high - about as tall as a seven-story building. Scout is\nused for launching Earth satellites or sounding rockets.\nDELTA\n\nNext is Delta, which has three stages. Its first stage is a\nliquid-fuel Thor missile with 150,000 pounds of thrust. The\nsecond stage is a liquid-fuel rocket; the top stage is a solid-fuel\nrocket. Ninety-two feet high, Delta is used for medium-size\nEarth satellites and very small space probes. It can boost a 480pound spacecraft into a 300-mile orbit or provide sufficient velocity to permit a 65-pound spacecraft to escape Earth\'s gravity.\nTHOR-AGENA B\n\nMoving up the ladder, there is Thor-Agena B. This is a\ntwo-stage launch vehicle, eighty feet high. The lower stage is\nagain the Thor missile, a booster which has demonstrated a high\ndegree of reliability. Atop the Thor is Agena B, a liquid-fuel\nrocket with 15,000 pounds of thrust. Designed for boosting\nmedium-sized Earth satellites, Thor-Agena B can send a 1,600pound spacecraft into a 300-mile orbit.\nATLAS-AGENA B\n\nFor still larger payloads, there is Atlas-Agena B. The Agena\nB is again the second stage, but the first stage is the powerful\n74\n\nAtlas missile, which develops\n360,000 pounds of thrust.\nNinety-eight feet high, it can\nblast a two and one-half ton\nspacecraft into a 300-mile orbit,\nor it can push a smaller payload\nof 800 pounds beyond Earth\'s\ngravity into deep space.\n\n!\n\nT\n\n4\n\nCENTAUR\n\nOne step further up the ladder is Centaur. Centaur has two\npowerful rocket stages, the lower one being the Atlas. The second stage has two liquid-fuel\nrockets using a new type of fueloxidizer combination, liquid hydrogen and\t liquid\t oxygen. The\nhydrogen replaces the kerosenetype fuel used in earlier launch\nvehicles. This hydrogen-oxygen\ncombination produces a higher\nspecific impulse, hence greater\npower. The two rockets produce\n30,000 pounds of thrust in a fairly small second stage. Despite\n\nAn experimental Centaur upperstage vehicle rests atop modified\nAtlas in a gantry crane. Centaur will\nbe first liquid hydrogen-powered\nspacecraft. It is designed to launch\ninterplanetary probes, and "softland" instruments on moon.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nI\n\nits increased power, Centaur is only eight feet taller than AflasAgena B.\nWith Centaur, scientists will be able to perform some of\nthe more advanced unmanned space missions. Centaur can provide escape velocity for a 1,450-pound spacecraft, and it has a\nvery precise guidance system. It can send instrument packages\nto the moon, either for landing or for orbiting, and it can send\na spacecraft to the vicinity of the closer planets.\nSATURN\n\nEven Centaur, with all its thrust, is not adequate for the\nnext steps in manned space exploration. Remember, the smallest and least complex multi-man spacecraft now contemplated\nwill weigh about ten tons. This requires a still larger launch vehicle. Such a vehicle, called Saturn, is already being developed.\nWork was started on Saturn in 1958, but it will not be\nready until the mid-sixties, an example of how long it takes to\nbuild one of these mighty new launch vehicles. The basic Saturn\nwill have either two or three stages. The first stage will have\n1,500,000 pounds of thrust, more than four times the thrust in\nthe huge Atlas missile. Saturn\'s thrust is obtained by "clustering"; that is, grouping together eight individual engines, each\nproducing 188,000 pounds of thrust. These engines use liquid\npropellants, burning liquid oxygen and a type of purified rocket\npropellant.\nThe cluster system. of multiple engines is also used in the\nsecond stage. The engines are the same as those used in the\nsecond stage of Centaur. Saturn has six of them producing\n90,000 pounds thrust. If the third stage is used, it will consist\nof two additional engines developing 30,000 pounds of thrust.\nSaturn is enormous. It is 185 feet high, taller than an 18story building! It is so large that even its first stage alone cannot\nbe moved over rail or highway. A special barge had to be built\nto move it from its construction place in Alabama to its launching pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n76\n\n0\n\nWith its great thrust Saturn\nwill launch a number of important space missions. The most interesting is the multi-man space\nobservatory. Saturn can also\nsend a number of large-payload,\nunmanned experiments to the\nvicinity of the moon. It can also\nthrust a three-ton instrumented\nspacecraft to Mars or Venus.\nYet for manned flight\naround the moon, still more\npower will be needed. Thus an\nadvanced model of Saturn is being planned. For this version, a\nhuge rocket engine is now under\ndevelopment. In a single chamber, this engine will produce as\nmuch thrust as all eight engines\nof the basic Saturn - 1,500,000\npounds. The advanced Saturn\nwill employ two such engines in\nthe lower stage, for a total thrust\noutput of 3,000,000 pounds. In\nthe second stage, four of the\n200,000-pound-thrust hydrogen\n\nRanger I, first in family of unmanned\nspacecraft designed for exploration\nof moon and planets, was launched\nby this Atlas-Agena B two-stage\nrocket August 23, 1961. Later\nRangers are to "hard-land" instrument packages on the moon.\n\na\nC\n\n0\n\nengines will be clustered for an additional 800,000 pounds of\nthrust. The third stage will have six engines with a total thrust\nof 90,000 pounds. The advanced Saturn is being d6signed to\nhurl fifty tons into Earth orbit or send twelve tons on a one-way\ntrip to Mars.\nThe advanced Saturn launch vehicle will make possible a\ntrip around the moon in a multi-man spacecraft by about 1965.\nHowever, the spacecraft will not be able to land on the moon.\nTo do so would require much more payload in terms of rocket\npropellant for braking on the descent to the moon\'s surface and\nfor the all-important return trip, including more braking power\nfor re-entry into Earth\'s atmosphere.\nYou can see how demanding are the power requirements\nfor space exploration, when even a huge launcher like the advanced Saturn is not capable of handling the man-on-the-moon\nassignment. And this is only an early step to real space conquest. For the manned lunar landing, and for long-distance\nspace probes, a vehicle which dwarfs even mighty Saturn is\nplanned.\nNOVA\nThis super-launch vehicle bears the tentative code name\nof Nova. It may be either liquid- or solid-fueled. In one version,\nthe first stage is powered by eight of the large 1,500,000-poundthrust liquid-fuel rockets used in the advanced Saturn. Clustering eight of these engines would provide Nova with 12,000,000\npounds of thrust in the bottom stage alone. Nova would also\nhave one or more upper stages. In fact, the entire advanced\nSaturn may become just an upper stage for Nova.\nNova might also employ large solid-fuel rockets, which\nhave certain advantages over liquid-fuel rockets. However, although the 1;500,000-pound-thrust single-chamber liquid-fuel\nrocket is already well along in development, research in such\nvery powerful solid-fuel rockets is not as far along. Final decision as to form of propulsion and number of stages has not been\n78\n\nreached. Many experiments are needed to obtain the necessary\ndata.\nIn any event, Nova will be a king-sized launch vehicle. In\na three-stage liquid-fuel rocket form, it would stretch nearly\n300 feet into the air, almost the length of a football field. With\n12,000,000 pounds of thrust in the lower stage, it could launch\nthe manned lunar-landing spacecraft and send large unmanned\nprobes far into the solar system.\nThe Nuclear Launch Vehicle\n\nIt would seem that the incredible Nova would have to be\nthe ultimate in launch vehicles, but it is not. There is a further\nstep - using nuclear propulsion, a priority area of current space\npropulsion research.\nIn a nuclear rocket, a "working fluid" such as liquid hydrogen is passed through a nuclear reactor, which provides the\nsource of heat instead of the combustion process which occurs\nin present rockets. The liquid hydrogen, superheated by the\nreactor, is changed into a gas and exhausted through a nozzle\nto produce thrust. This system provides far greater performance than the conventional rocket - it could increase the payload capabilities of Nova or Saturn by two to three times, opening up a whole new range of possible space missions.\nBut what of the real "space ships," huge craft capable of\nhurtling to the far reaches of our solar system, remaining in\nspace for months or even years? Is it possible to build launch\nvehicles capable of blasting such spacecraft through the atmosphere and beyond the pull of gravity, when even a monstrous\nbooster like the nuclear Nova cannot send a crew to Mars?\nTheoretically, it is possible, but the mind recoils at the\npower, size, and cost of such a launcher. There is an alternative:\nthe space station. Hitherto a dream of the science fiction writers,\nthe space station is now a practical consideration in space\nplanning.\nRemember, all of the mighty power we have been discus79\n\nNATONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADINSTRATC\n\n11^\n\nva^\n\nr.\n\n.1.i\nThe "nozzles" of giant Saturn Booster-82 feet long, 22\nin diameter\xe2\x80\x94fairly shout "thrust." Booster, which is most\nof Saturn Rocket\'s power plant, will be capable of placing\nten tons in low Earth orbit.\n80\n\nsing is needed primarily to boost the spacecraft through the\natmosphere and to overcome gravity. What if the spacecraft\ncould start its voyage beyond the atmosphere, with gravity already neutralized? The possibilities are obviously enormous.\nWith no air resistance to combat, arelatively small amount\nof rocket thrust could accelerate a very heavy spacecraft to\ngreat speeds. The huge weight of launch vehicles could be\neliminated or translated into useful payload - oxygen supplies,\nfood and water, protective equipment, space for living quarters,\nand large amounts of fuel for controlling and braking the spacecraft. Such a vehicle could change course at will instead of\ncoasting on momentum in a prearranged path.\nAll this would be possible if there were available a station\nin space. And it is possible to build such a station. It will be,\nin effect, a very large manned Earth-orbiting satellite, a miniature moon.\nThe Space Station\n\nA permanent space station will require a crew of many\nmen, perhaps twenty, plus the necessary artificial environment,\nprotective equipment, and supplies for an indefinite stay in\nspace. Thus, it will be extremely heavy and cannot be launched\nintact from Earth. However, it can be assembled in space by a\ntechnique known as "orbital rendezvous."\nThe design most frequently proposed for the permanent\nspace station is a wheel- or doughnut-shaped structure with a\nhub, or core, in the center. The various sections of the station\nwould be built on Earth, like a prefabricated house, then assembled in orbit. In the rendezvous technique, the core, or\ncenter section, would first be sent into orbit at an altitude of\nfrom 1,000 to 2,000 miles. This core would be a spacecraft similar to the observation satellites discussed in Chapter I, weighing about ten tons and containing three or four men. Then, one\nat a time, the other sections would be brought up to the core\nby a shuttle-spacecraft, operating between an Earth base and\n81\n\nthe space station. Assembling the space station in an Earth orbit\nrequires extraordinarily precise guidance, since the shuttling\nspacecraft must enter the same orbit as the core of the space\nstation and meet the core in space. It is something like throwing\na ball into the air and then trying to hit it with another ball.\nIf the shuttle-craft misses its target by a few hundred yards,\nit can be maneuvered into contact with the core by a short\nburst of rocket power.\nTo assemble the prefabricated sections, the astronauts will,\nof course, have to leave the core. They will need advanced\ntypes of space suits with a built-in pressurization and breathing\nsystem. Oxygen will be supplied by tanks strapped to the space\nsuit, much like those used for underwater exploration. Small\njets built into the suit will permit maneuvering.\nThe idea of constructing a large structure in space, while\nwhirling about the Earth at a speed of about 17,000 miles an\nhour, is difficult to grasp. Remember, though, that there is\npractically no impression of speed. If you fly in a jet airliner\nsix miles above the Earth, and look out the window, it seems\nas if you are almost standing still, in spite of the fact that you\nare moving at 600 miles an hour. The spacemen would have\neven less of a sensation of motion. After all, this very minute\nyou are hurtling through space at twenty miles per second, but\nyou are not aware of this motion because it is relative to a reference point, the sun, ninety-three million miles away. In addition, the spacemen would not have to contend with air resistance, which also causes a sensation of speed.\nThe huge sections of the space station, which might weigh\na ton or more on Earth, weigh nothing in orbit, since gravity is\ncounterbalanced by orbital velocity. Thus they can be nudged\ninto position by short blasts from the space-suit jets.\nIn this manner, each of the prefabricated sections will be\nbrought up from Earth and bolted into place until the space\nstation is completely assembled. Once it is completed, shuttlecraft will continue to bring up supplies.\n82\n\nto\n\no\n= U)\n\ncE\n.2 ut\n4-.\n\na,\n\n(I) -\n\n- G) 0\n\n/\n\n.\t\n\n\'II\n\nD >\n\nE\n\nF;\n\n(...\n\nIn this artist\'s conception,\na proposed "flexible-wing\nparaglider" takes spent\nSaturn first-stage rocket\nsafely back to the Earth,\nfor possible re-use.\nSaturn is to develop\n1,500,000 pounds thrust.\nThe Re-Usable Launch Vehicle\n\nFor continuous resupply of the space station, another major\ndevelopment is required. This is the re-usable launch vehicle.\nThe current practice of letting a multimillion-dollar launch vehicle drop into the ocean after it has boosted a spacecraft into\norbit would be prohibitively expensive. It is feasible, however,\nto build a manned launch vehicle with wings, aerodynamic\ncontrols, and re-entry protection. A vehicle of this design could\nlaunch a spacecraft toward the permanent space station, then\nreturn to Earth to be used again.\nThe space station will serve as a "filling station in the sky."\nSince fuel is by far the major portion of any space payload, the\nspacecraft can take off from Earth "light," with just enough\nrocket fuel for maneuvering into contact with the space station.\nThere it can take on a full load of fuel and proceed to its final\ndestination - the moon or other planets. And, of course, the\namount of fuel needed for even a very long trip is minimized,\nsince the spacecraft starts its voyage outside the atmosphere\nand 2,000 miles from Earth\'s center of gravity.\n84\n\nElectrical Propulsion\n\nThere is still another step which cuts fuel requirements for\nspacecraft to almost nothing and makes possible even the most\ndistant voyage within the solar system. This power system is\ncalled electrical propulsion.\nThe most advanced rockets can fire for only a few minutes.\nIn that time, they consume all their fuel, but they produce tremendous thrust which permits the spacecraft to "coast" on\nmomentum after the fuel burns up. If a spacecraft could start\nits journey from a permanent space station, a few pounds of\nthrust would suffice to get it moving.\nElectrical propulsion makes possible low thrust for indefinite periods. In one design for electrical propulsion, a device\nsuch as a nuclear reactor breaks down atoms of a given substance into electrically charged particles. These charged particles can in turn be accelerated to high velocity and ejected from\nthe vehicle by an electrostatic pumping device. Escaping at\nvery high velocities, these particles perform the same function\nas the stream of hot gas in a rocket engine. They produce an\naction, and the resulting reaction produces thrust. Research on\nelectrical power plants is already under way and, although it is\nstill in its infancy, this type of propulsion appears promising;\n\n85\n\nLM\n\n- S\n\nlk\nA\n\ngaw\n\nr\n\nHE intriguing question about space exploration is Where!\nTdo we go from\n? here?"\nP It is possible to predict, with a high probability of accuracy, 44\nthe events of the next ten years in space flight, because the program for the coming decade of U. S. space exploration has already been laid out. The Soviet Union has not confided in us its\n-S.\n\'\t\nplans for the next ten years, but it is most likely that the Russian\n.\t\nprogram will proceed along lines similar to ours.\nTo start with, throughout the decade there will be a long-IN\nsuccession of sounding rockets and unmanned Earth satellites\ndesigned to acquire specific information and to perfect some of\nthe applied space systems discussed earlier. We will omit detailed discussion of these programs in order to devote the space\navailable to the more exciting lunar and interplanetary prod\ngrams.\n\n1\n\n1\'\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2f\xe2\x80\xa2 ,\n\nAN SN ILAN N UDSU WflIUSN rLRNL I IIIU\n\nxpIoration of the Moon\', fl\n\nij\n\nA\t\n\nA 4r\n\n,\n\n.\t v\n\n7\t\n\nV ti\'\n\n/\n\nThroughout the decade of the sixties, the moon will be\nTarget Number One. From the scientific standpoint, the moon\nis a treasure house of information, a perfect laboratory for discoveries relating to such intriguing problems as the origin of\nour solar system, the development of the stars, and the formation of matter.\nOn Earth, the surface haschanged constantly over the centuries, the result of erosion caused by rivers and oceans, winds,\nrain, and other types of weather. In the solar system the moon,\nhowever, is still in a "mint" condition. It has existed, at best\nestimates, for four and one-half billion years. It is believed to\nhave no atmosphere, no eroding waters, and no winds. Thus,\nit is probably unworn. Except for the peppering of its surface\nby meteors, the moon has remained virtually unchanged for\nmillions of centuries.\nAside from the knowledge to be gained by intense investigation of the moon, it has a tremendous value for deep space\nexploration. It is a natural "space station" much larger than\nanything man can build in space. It offers a potential base for\ndeep penetration of the solar system. The absence of both atmospheric drag and strong gravitational force permits a very\nlow escape velocity. A spacecraft can leave the moon\'s surface\nwith minimal thrust requirements. It is even possible that,\nafter establishment of a lunar base, man may discover materials which will permit manufacture of rocket fuel on the moon,\neliminating the need to transport fuel from Earth.\nThe moon is a natural target because it is our nearest neighbor in space; its average distance from Earth is about 240,000\nmiles. It has a diameter of 2,160 miles, approximately one-fourth\nthat of Earth. Its gravity is about one-sixth that of Earth, and\nthe escape velocity needed is only slightly more than 5,000\nmiles per hour.\nThe first steps in lunar exploration will be unmanned. The\nunmanned portion of the moon program will be carried out in\nthree stages, each bearing a code name. These steps have been\n88\n\nin preparation for some time and the first unmanned U. S. spacecraft is scheduled to land on the moon in 1962 or early 1963.\nThe Ranger Program\n\nThis first lunar probe is called Ranger. The spacecraft is\ndifficult to describe, since it is nothing more than a collection\nof carefully arranged equipment. Remember, once the spacecraft leaves Earth\'s atmosphere, it encounters no air resistance\nall the way to the moon\'s surface. There is no need for the\nstreamlining traditionally associated with science-fiction spacecraft.\nThe Ranger spacecraft consists of a six-sided "barrel" containing the scientific equipment and controls. Protruding from\ntwo sides of the barrel are long solar paddles, each ten square\nfeet in area, covered with solar cells which trap radiant energy\nfrom the sun and convert it to power for the various items of\nequipment.\nOn the top . and bottom of the spacecraft are antenna\n"dishes." The lower antenna is pointed at Earth so that signals\ncan be sent from a ground station to the spacecraft. The upper\nantenna points at the sun, so that the paddles will catch the\nsun\'s energy. The spacecraft is equipped with "sensors," which\n"study" the position of Ranger relative to the Earth and sun.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If the spacecraft deviates from the proper position, the sensors\nsend signals to small steering jets, which fire briefly and bring\n-the spacecraft back into position so that the antennas are always pointed properly.\nThe lunar-landing Ranger is actually two spacecraft in one\npackage. The main spacecraft is called the "bus." Inside the\nbus is a second spacecraft, a thirty-inch sphere containing scientific instruments, with a small rocket attached to it. The main\nspacecraft is designed to make a "hard" landing on the moon.\nIt will crash onto the lunar surface at high speed, so the experiments it will make must be conducted swiftly as it approaches\nthe moon.\n89\n\nThe spherical second spacecraft will separate from the\nmain spacecraft prior to landing and make a "semihard" landing. The rockets of the second spacecraft will brake the fall as\nit hurtles toward the surface, and the instruments within the\nsphere will be protected by padding and a wall of liquid to\ncushion the shock. The instruments are designed to operate\nafter landing.\n\nThe basic Ranger spacecraft, designed for\nhard lunar landing. Extended "wings" contain\nhundreds of solar cells, which intercept energy from the sun and convert it to electric\npower for instruments. An advanced version\nincorporates second small spacecraft, as a\nseparate "back-down" rocket for a semihard\nlanding.\n\n90\n\nThe entire main spacecraft is about twelve feet tall and\nweighs about 800 pounds. It is equipped with telemetering devices to send back information to Earth on "command." That\nis, a signal from Earth can start the scientific equipment working.\nThe semihard landing sphere also has telemetering equipment.\nRanger will conduct a number of experiments. The initial\nRangers, launched in 1961 and 1962, will not land on the moon.\nIntended primarily to test the basic design, they explore interplanetary space and the region between Earth and the moon.\nThese first Rangers do not have the spherical auxiliary spacecraft. Instead, they have instruments to send back data on\nradiation, on the Earth\'s magnetic field, and on the hydrogen\nlayer which encircles the Earth.\nThe advanced Rangers, which will impact the moon in\n"hard landing," contain a television camera which will take\nclose-up pictures of the lunar surface as the spacecraft approaches the moon. They also have a gamma ray spectrometer\nto determine whether the moon\'s crust has a high concentration\nof radioisotopes. The auxiliary spacecraft, or spherical landing\ncapsule, contains a seismometer, a device such as is used on\nEarth to record earthquake tremors. It will send back data on\nlunar quakes, volcanoes, or other disturbances within the crust\nof the moon.\nThe Ranger spacecraft will be launched \xe2\x80\xa2 by the AtlasAgena B launch vehicle described in the preceding chapter. The\ninitial velocity, as the spacecraft leaves Earth, will be just under\n25,000 miles per hour. This is considered the best speed for a\nlunar mission; if the spacecraft started out at a higher speed,\nit would be going too fast when it reached the moon. At a lower\nspeed, of course, it could not escape from Earth and hence\nwould not reach the moon. Ranger will take sixty-five hours to\nreach the moon. Since the moon is moving around the Earth,\nthe spacecraft is not aimed directly at the moon, but rather at\na point in space where the moon will be sixty-five hours after\nthe time of launch.\n91\n\nA Typical Ranger Flight\n\nHere is the flight sequence for a Ranger lunar mission.\nThe Atlas-Agena B.boosts the spacecraft to an altitude of\n350 miles and a speed of close to 25,000 miles per hour. On the\nway through the atmosphere, the spacecraft is covered by a\nstreamlined metal shroud to minimize the effects of air resistance. In space, the shroud falls off automatically, the launch\nvehicle separates, and the spacecraft starts on its path toward.\nthe moon rendezvous.\nAfter the launch, Ranger will coast on momentum. On a\nsignal from Earth, the solar paddles (which were folded into\nthe barrel at launch) are lowered into position. On another signal, the sensors go into action and line up the spacecraft so that\nits Earth antenna and its solar antenna are properly aligned.\nMeanwhile, ground stations track the flight of the Ranger\nby radio telescopes. At about the halfway mark, controllers on\nEarth compare the path of the spacecraft with the actual moon\ntrajectory to see if Ranger is on course. If it is not, they send a\nsignal which fires the spacecraft\'s steering rockets and corrects\nits course. At this point, the gamma ray spectrometer. starts\noperating.\nAll this time the spacecraft is gradually losing speed, because it is still in Earth\'s gravitational field. The farther it moves\nfrom Earth, the weaker the pull of Earth gravity. Sixty hours\nfromEarth, it will reach a point about 24,000 miles from the\nmoon - nine t\xc3\xaanths of the total distance from Earth to the\nmoon. At this point; the spacecraft has slowed down to slightly\nmore than 1,000 miles per hour.;But now the moon\'s gravity\ncaptures the spacecraft and starts to pull-the Ranger toward the\nsurface of the moon, accelerating it once again..\t\nNow the controllers on Earth send another series ofCommands. First, the Ranger must be turned around so that the\nbraking rocket in the landing capsule is pointed at the surface\nof the moon. This is accomplished by firing short bursts on the\ncontrol jets. Another signal sets the television camera in action.\n92\n\n\'U\nLU\n0\nlz\n\'U\n0\n\nE\nIs,\n\n0\nIC.)\nLu\n\nI.-\n\nI-\n\nz\n\n0\n\nLu\n\nIL\n\nz\nAir\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 4\xe2\x80\x94a\n\nWci\n\nO4-.\r\n\xe2\x80\xa2c\n\nbO Q\n\n.E o\n\nX . 0\nCL\n-\n\n4-.\n\nWC\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94cr E\nNATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADNINISTRATIO\n\nUnder the influence of lunar gravity, the spacecraft hurtles\nmoonward, its telemetry equipment sending back television\nimages of the moon\'s surface as it "rushes up" to meet the spacecraft. Within the Ranger is a radio altimeter, which measures\nthe height of the spacecraft above the moon\'s surface. When\nthe spacecraft reaches the desired altitude (about 100 miles),\nthe altimeter in the spacecraft sends a signal which sets off the\nrocket in the landing capsule and ejects the capsule from the\nmain spacecraft. After the ejection, the TV camera ceases operation.\nThe main spacecraft, its job done, crashes onto the surface\nof the moon. The second spacecraft (landing sphere), its reverse rocket thrust slowing it up, makes a more gradual descent\nand hits the moon with a jarring but not destructive impact.\nIts seismometer starts to send back data, and continues to do\nso for about three months.\nThe Surveyor Program\n\nThere will be six or seven Ranger impact missions before\nthe next step in lunar exploration is undertaken. Step Two is\nthe more difficult "soft" landing with delicate and much more\ncomplex instruments, to be accomplished by a spacecraft called\nSurveyor.\nThough larger and much heavier than Ranger, the Surveyor spacecraft is similar to Rangei in shape, or rather in lack\nof definable shape. It is simply a structure containing a battery\nof instruments, sensors, control jets, and other equipment. Surveyor contains many more instruments than Ranger, and its\ninstruments are more sophisticated, or "intelligent;"\nSurveyor is thirteen feet tall and weighs about 2,600\npounds. To boost this weight to the moon, the Centaur launch\nvehicle, more powerful than the Atlas-Agena B, is needed.\nThe center section of the Surveyor contains a large rocket\nengine and its fuel tanks. This is the rocket which permits the\n"soft" landing. It fires continuously throughout the descent to\n94\n\nI\n\nModel Surveyor shows instruments to take samples on moon.\n\nthe moon, its braking thrust permitting the spacecraft to "back\ndown" to a gentle landing. Protruding from the structure are\nthree "landing legs," each equipped with a shock-absorbing\nsystem such as those used on the wheel struts of an airliner.\nThese legs take up the landing shock and also allow the spacecraft to remain upright after landing.\nSurveyor will perform a number of experiments on the\nsurface of the moon. It is instrumented to take radiation readings, record data about magnetism on the moon, record temperatures, and collect information on the internal structure of\n95\n\n\r\n\nthe moon. Special instruments, propelled by a gas jet, can be \r\nprojected about fifteen feet away from the main structure so \r\nthat they will not interfere with other experiments and will not \r\nrecord any possible contamination of the lunar surface by the \r\nbraking rocket\'s gas. Fifteen feet is considered an adequate distance because of lack of atmosphere to spread the contamination. \r\nFor a complete look at the moon\'s surface in the landing\r\narea, Surveyor has a very advanced television system. There \r\nare four separate television cameras, one directly beneath the \r\nspacecraft as it stands upright and three others located adjacent\r\nto each of the landing legs. Instead of pointing at the moon\'s\n\nThe "soft-landing" technique for unmanned lunar\nspacecraft is shown in\nthis artist\'s conception.\nAs spacecraft nears the\nmoon, signals from Earth\norient it so that its rocket\nthrust is directed downward\xe2\x80\x94toward moon\'s surface.

The mirrors can be turned in any direction by a\nsignal from Earth, permitting 360-degree coverage of the lunar\nlanding area. Like Ranger, Surveyor will also take pictures as\nit descends to the moon\'s surface, but better images are expected since it will be descending slowly.\nThe Lunar Drill\n\nThe most fascinating of Surveyor\'s many experiments is\nthe "lunar drill," an instrument which will permit the very important examination of the surface and subsurface composition\nof the moon. This will provide a number of vital scientific clues.\nIs the moon composed of the same material as Earth? Does it\nhave the elements necessary for the manufacture of rocket fuel?\nWhat is its internal temperature? Does it have a molten core\nlike Earth? What is its internal structure?\nThe lunar drill is one of the most ingenious instruments\never devised. The drill itself, built something like an oil drill,\nis sixty inches long. Mounted on a retractable arm, it extends\nseveral feet away from the spacecraft. It makes a hole one and\nthree-quarter inches in diameter and five feet deep. The surface\nmaterial extracted from the moon\'s surface is forced by pressure\nup a chute and into a pulverizer, which grinds it into a fine\npowder. The material then passes through a set of four instruments, each of which makes a specific test to determine the\npresence or absence of certain elements. The findings of each\ninstrument are translated into a coded signal which is telemetered back to Earth for analysis. Power for the drill, and for\nall the other instruments and the telemetry equipment, is provided by a combination of solar cells and batteries.\nThe flight sequence for a Surveyor mission is similar to that\nOf Ranger, except for the use of the Centaur vehicle as the\nlauncher. Nine tenths of the way to the moon, the spacecraft is\n"oriented," or turned around, so that the thrust blast of the\nrocket engine is pointed toward the surface\' of the moon. Again,\nurfac\n97\n\nNATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION\n\nW-9\ni-0\n/\n\n\\\n\n-\t Artist\'s conception of one possible Prospector spacecraft design: a roving vehicle or "moon crawler." After\nsoft landing, instrumented, tool-equipped craft would\nmove about on large balloon tires, perform experiments\n"commanded" by radio from Earth.\n\nthe radio altimeter ignites the rocket, but this time there is no\ncapsule separation, as in Ranger. The rocket continues to fire\nall the way to the lunar surface. Its thrust is carefully precalculated so that it is slightly lower than the amount needed to balance lunar gravity. The rocket thrust would normally force the\nspacecraft upward, but lunar gravity is exerting a slightly\nstronger downward force. The net result is a slow backingdown action. The spacecraft will bump the surface at a descent\nspeed of only five miles an hour, and even this slight jolt is\ncushioned by the shock-absorbing landing legs. Then Surveyor\'s fascinating instruments go to work exploring the moon\n98\n\n\r\n\nwithout any help from man, other than the radio signals coming\n240,000 miles through space from Earth.\nThe Moon-Orbiting Surveyor\n\nThere are certain experiments which need to be performed\nabove the moon, rather than on the surface; for instance, de-\n\ntailed mapping of the lunar surface to discover terrain features\nwhich cannot be seen by Earth telescopes. For this and other\nexperiments in connection with the moon\'s magnetic field and\nradiation in the space above the moon, there is an alternate\nversion of Surveyor. This does not land on the lunar surface but\ninstead goes into orbit around the moon.\nIn this version, the lunar drill and other surface instruments are replaced by a different instrumentation and the landing legs are eliminated. The flight sequence is the same until\nit comes time to orient the spacecraft. At this point, signals\nfrom Earth will turn the spacecraft to the proper position for\na lunar orbit and the rocket will be ignited. Surveyor will be\ntraveling too fast to go into orbit, since a lunar orbit requires\na much lower speed (less than 5,000 miles per hour) than an\nEarth orbit. The job of the rocket, then, is to fire in reverse direction and slow the spacecraft to orbital speed. Target dates\nfor Surveyor missions are 1963-65.\nThe Prospector Program\n\nAfter Surveyor comes a still more advanced unmanned\nlunar-exploration spacecraft called Prospector.\nActually, Prospector is the name of a project given a whole \r\nseries of spacecraft rather than one specific design. It is impossible to describe any one of these spacecraft, since the designs have not yet been completed. However, space scientists \r\nhave mapped out the types of missions Prospector will perform. \r\nThe first type of Prospector spacecraft is designed for a\r\nvery detailed photographic survey of the moon, taken at a very\r\nlow altitude. Such a vehicle can answer a lot of questions that\n99\n\nhave puzzled astronomers for years. For instance, telescope observers occasionally notice slight blurs in the bottoms of moon\ncraters. Can these blurs be carbon dioxide clouds, as has been\ntheorized? There are also dark streaks radiating from certain\ncraters. Can they be due to some primitive form of plant life?\nThe low-altitude-survey spacecraft can send back pictorial\ndata to unlock these and a number of other lunar mysteries.\nFor this mission, the Prospector spacecraft will be a "hovercraft," that is, it will be able to hover over the moon like a hell\xe2\x80\xa2 copter and skip about from one location to another. It will have\n\xe2\x80\xa2 a number of powerful rocket engines to enable it to back down\nto the moon like Surveyor, but when it reaches photographic\n\xe2\x80\xa2 altitude (perhaps fifty or a hundred feet), the thrust will be\nadjusted so that it drops no lower. It will hang in space, supported by its rockets, as a helicopter hangs on its rotor blades.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Its battery of television cameras will go into action, photographing the surface from every angle. Then, on a signal from Earth,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 control jets will move the spacecraft to another position. When\n\xe2\x80\xa2 the rocket fuel is \'nearly exhausted, the spacecraft will be permitted to land on the surface; where a separate battery of instruments will start transmitting surface \xe2\x80\xa2 data.\n- Another Prospector version is the "roving vehicle," which\ncrawls about the surface of the moon recording and transmitting data as it goes.\' The vehicle\' will have large balloon tires\nor tank treads for moving over the lunar terrain and it will \'have\n\'a separate. engine for "moon crawling." Its instruments will be\n\xe2\x80\xa2 similar to those in Surveyor, and the roving vehicle can be\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 stopped and started \'by\' a signal from Earth, permitting samplings from many different parts of the lunar surface.\nReturnable Unmanned Lunar Spacecraft\n\nThe third type of Prospector will contain "returnable capsules," that is; small spacecraft which can return to Earth from\nthe moon; carrying -samples of surface material for detailed\nanalysis in Earth laboratories. In this version, the main space100\n\ncraft will back down to the moon on rocket thrust as in the\nother missions. A lunar drill will extract a surface-sample and\nconvey it to a capsule. The capsule is equipped with a large\nrocket engine, powerful enough to escape from the moon\'s\ngravity and enter a trajectory back to Earth.\nOnce the capsule is loaded with moon material, a sensor\n"tells" the ground station back on Earth. Earth controllers then\nsend a signal which ignites the rocket and sends the capsule\ninto its homeward path. The capsule will be a miniature spacecraft with its own control jets, power supply, and transmitting\nequipment. It will send out a continuous signal during its long\nvoyage home. Thus, the ground controllers can track it and\ncorrect its course if necessary. After it plunges through the\nupper atmosphere, protected by a heat shield, it will be lowered to Earth by parachute. The main Prospector spacecraft\nwill carry at least two - possibly three or four - of these returnable capsules.\nThe final mission planned for Prospector is that of cargo\ncarrier, to be used in conjunction with manned landings. After\nman has developed the capability of staying on the moon for\nextended periods, Prospector "space trucks" can bring up additional supplies which could not be carried in the manned spacecraft.\nWhatever their final designs, the various types of Prospectors will be large spacecraft, weighing up to ten tons when\nthey start their trips to the moon and three or four Earth tons\non the surface of the moon, after they have consumed most of\ntheir rocket fuel. Neither Atlas-Agena B nor Centaur can launch\na payload of that size, so that Prospector spacecraft will have\nto wait for final development of the Saturn launch vehicle or\nperhaps, in some of the more complex missions, the advanced\nSaturn. No specific timetable has been set for Prospector, but\nthe best estimate is 1967-69. During that period, space scientists\nwill be paving the way for the spectacular, exciting manned\nlunar landing, expected to come at the end of this decade.\n101\n\n\t\n!iFThThTiIii1fl\n\ni\n\nof the\n\n4\t\n\nMoon\n\nHIS nation has underLckcn to attempt to put man on the\nT moon by the end of this decade, or b y December 31, 1969.\nIt is possible that this target date may be bettered by a year or\nmore, but the program cannot be speeded up appreciahly because of the massive technological problems involved in a lunar\nlanding and return to Earth.\nBefore the lunar landing can be attempted, scientists must\nlearn more about the space between Earth and its moon. In\nparticular, they must know more about the various types of\nradiation aiict hw dangerouitiiey may be, and the frequency\nof micrometeorites and the chances of their puncturing the\nspacecraft hull. Scientists must also leani more about the moon\nitself and study in detail the hazards to human life on the moon.\nThey must even select a lunar landing field.\nIn addition, there is still much to be learned about the\nphysiology of man during space flight. And from the te\xc3\xa8hnological standpoint - the actual construction of the spacecraft\n\nand its launching vehicle - a simple listing of the problems to\nbe solved would take up several pages of this book.\nThe lunar-landing mission will be preceded by a long succession of manned space flights. Under Project Mercury, manned\nEarth-orbital flights will continue for two to three years. In the\nMercury capsule, astronauts will venture into orbits farther and\nfarther from Earth and remain in space up to Mercury\'s maximum capability of twenty-eight hours. These flights will provide much, but not all, of the required physiological data.\nDyna-Soar\n\nA separate manned space-flight program, called Dyna-Soar,\nwill get under way about 1964. Dyna-Soar is what is known as\na "boost-glide" spacecraft. A small, one-man craft, it is boosted\ninto space by a launch vehicle to a speed just short of orbital\nvelocity. This speed is sufficient to allow the Dyna-Soar to coast\naround the Earth several times, then spiral down to the surface.\nThe Dyna-Soar spacecraft has wings and control jets and resembles a small airplane. Unlike the Mercury capsule, which is\nlowered to Earth by parachute, the Dyna-Soar can be flown\ndown to a controlled landing. This type of spacecraft will contribute information in the vital area of re-entry into the Earth\'s\natmosphere.\nProject Apollo\n\nThe manned lunar-landing program is known as Project\nApollo. It consists of three distinct steps:\nFirst, there will be a series of Earth-orbital flights in the\nthree-man Apollo spacecraft with flight durations up to fourteen days. These flights will serve a number of purposes. They\nwill permit the training of space crews; the many complex systems within the spacecraft will be thoroughly tested; and information on the behavior of the human body over extended\nperiods in space will be obtained. During the Earth-orbital\nflights, techniques of controlling the spacecraft will be fully\n104\n\ndeveloped and the spacecraft will be used as a laboratory for\nastronomical observations above Earth\'s layer of atmosphere,\nwhich distorts observations made from the surface.\nIn the second phase of the Apollo program, the spacecraft\nwill be flown to greater and greater distances from Earth, culminating in a "circumlunar" flight, or a trip around the moon.\nOn this flight, the crew will be able to study the moon up close.\nThey will also perform many of the vital guidance and control\ntasks that will be needed on the moon-landing mission, including the high-speed re-entry into Earth\'s atmosphere and the\nsubsequent landing.\nPhase Three will be the greatest adventure of all time, the\nmanned lunar landing.\nMajor- Considerations for Manned Lunar Landing\n\nBefore discussing the Apollo spacecraft, let us consider\nsome of the major problems of the manned lunar-landing mission.\nFirst, there is the launch-vehicle requirement. The spacecraft will weigh, on departure from Earth, between sixty and\nseventy-five tons. The launch vehicle will have to hurl that\ngreat weight into space, and also accelerate the spacecraft to\nescape velocity, about 25,000 miles per hour. This requires use\nof the Nova super-booster, either liquid- or solid-fueled.\nNavigation, which is a problem even in Earth orbit, will\nbe a vital consideration in the lunar-landing mission. The spacecraft will not just "hit the moon"; it must land in a precise spot\nselected in advance. An unmanned spacecraft like Surveyor will\npave the way. With its lunar drill it will find a site hard enough\nto sustain a manned landing, and with its multiple television\ncameras it will make sure the site is free of obstacles which\nmight damage the manned spacecraft on landing. Surveyor will\nalso leave a radio beacon on the lunar landing field, so that the\nApollo navigator can "home" on its radio signals.\nStarting with an initial velocity of 25,000 miles per hour,\nthe Apollo spacecraft must follow a very accurate course to the\n105\n\nEARTH-OR\nCONFIGU R1\n\nI\nCUMLUNAR\nN FIG U RAT! C N\n\nlunar landing field. By taking\nstar fixes, the navigator will be\nable to determine how close he\nis to the preplanned path. Midway to the moon a correction\ncan be made by firing control\nrockets.\nHowever, the amount of\ncorrection which can be made is\nlimited, because the supply of\nrocket fuel is limited. The spacecraft must carry fuel for correction, fuel for slowing the craft as\nit approaches the moon, fuel for\na controlled landing, fuel for a\nlunar take-off, and fuel for braking again as it returns to Earth.\nWith this fuel limitation, the\nnavigator cannot make very\nlarge course corrections, nor can\nhe make frequent corrections.\nThus, the manned lunar-landing\nmission will call for extremely\nexact navigation techniques that\nminimize error.\nRe-entry into the Atmosphere\n\nAt top, a possible design for a\nmanned Earth-orbiting Apollo\nspacecraft, with conical "command"\nsection and cylindrical observatory\nand living quarters. Moon-circling\nversion, below, omits observatory\nand substitutes a rocket system for\ncourse-correction power.\n\nRe-entry into Earth\'s atmosphere is critical. As the spacecraft returns from the moon,\nEarth\'s gravity will cause it to\naccelerate until it reaches the\nsame speed at which it escaped\nfrom Earth, 25,000 miles per\nhour. The re-entry heat encoun-\n\ntered at this speed is much more\nsevere than that encountered on\na satellite landing. To combat it\neffectively, the spacecraft must\nreturn to Earth in a narrow "corridor." This corridor might be\ncompared with the landing path\nof an airplane as it approaches\na runway. If the plane comes in\ntoo low, it will land short of the\nrunway; too high and it will\novershoot the runway. In the\ncase of the lunar spacecraft, the\n"landing path" is a corridor approximately one hundred miles\nwide approaching Earth\'s atmosphere at an angle of about\nforty-five degrees. If the spacecraft re-enters on the low side\nof this corridor, it will strike the\natmosphere at too severe an angle, causing excessive heating as\na result of friction and probable\ndisintegration. If it comes in too\nhigh, on the upper side of the\ncorridor, it will only skim the\natmosphere and will not slow\ndown sufficiently for a re-entry.\nIt would, instead, "bounce" off\nthe top of the atmosphere and\nhurtle back into space on a wide\nelliptical path. So, again, there\nis the requirement for highly accurate navigation and control\nbefore a lunar landing is made.\n\n/\n\n0\n0\n\ncomplete lunar-landing Apollo\nmight look like this. Men live in the\ncone-shaped section. Escape rockets for return to Earth are in next\nsection below. Bottom section has\nlarge rocket motor for soft "backdown" landing on moon. If enough\nthrust is available, observatory may\nbe added.\nA\n\nThe Solar Flare\n\nRadiation is a minor problem on Earth-orbital missions,\nbecause the spacecraft can stay below the radiation belts surrounding the Earth. On the moon voyage, the spacecraft must\npass through these belts. Protection can be provided for this\ntype of radiation, but there is an even greater problem in the\nsolar flare.\nThe solar flare is a storm on the surface of the sun, which\nsends out radiation for hundreds of millions of miles. These\nstorms occur frequently, but fortunately nearly all of them are\nminor flares, and protection for the astronauts can be built into\nthe spacecraft.\nOccasionally, however, there is a giant solar flare, which\nsends out radiation so intense that the weight of shielding material would be prohibitive in the Apollo spacecraft. The only\napparent solution to this problem is to develop a technique for\npredicting the build-up of a giant flare, then postpone the lunar\nflight. In the past ten years, only seven giant solar flares have\nbeen observed, but an unexpected super "sun storm "could be\ndisastrous to a lunar mission.\nWeightlessness\n\nThe phenomenon of weightlessness which occurs during\nspace flight is still an enigma to space scientists. In early manned\nflights, it has proved to be no problem, but rather a pleasant\nsensation. However, these flights were of short duration. There\nis still the question of whether prolonged weightlessness, for\nmore than two days en route to the moon and two more days\non the way back, might not bring on nausea, disorientation, or\nother illness. Such illness could be so severe that the astronauts\nwould not be able to perform the intricate navigation and control functions required of them.\nThe answer to this question will be found either in the\ncontinuing series of Mercury flights or the first phase of Project\n108\n\nApollo. If it appears that weightlessness is a problem, the solution lies in providing the spacecraft with an artificial "gravity,"\nso that the astronauts will have at least a portion of their normal\nEarth weight. This can be accomplished by a mechanical device\nwhich spins the spacecraft around its axis slowly, at about one\nrevolution per minute.\nGeneral Features of the Apollo Spacecraft\n\nThe final design of the Apollo spacecraft has not yet been\ndetermined. While unmanned spacecraft and manned Mercury\ncapsules are performing the preliminary research, the Apollo\ndesign will be changed and refined many times. When the best\npossible configuration is agreed upon, the "go-ahead" will be\ngiven for the start of construction.\nIt is however, possible to describe the Apollo spacecraft\nin general terms. Because of its three-phase assignment, Apollo\nis designed on the "building-block" concept, meaning that there\nare four separate major sections which can be used in any combination. The central building block is called the "command\ncenter." This is the main capsule which houses the crew during\nlaunch and landing.\nIn one design under study, this command center is bellshaped, resembling a larger version of the Mercury capsule. It\nwill have retractable stub wings, or flaps, for control within\nEarth\'s atmosphere after the return from the moon or from\norbit, because, unlike Mercury, the Apollo spacecraft will be\nable to land at a preselected site. It will have a heat shield of\nan advanced type, for protection against very high re-entry\ntemperatures. For the slow descent to the surface after the reentry phase, the capsule will be lowered either by two large\nparachutes (it is too heavy for a single chute) or by a powerdriven rotor, such as the rotary wing of a helicopter.\nThe command center will be about the size of a small room.\nIt will have flight stations for each of the three astronauts, plus\n109\n\n0\n0\n\nDiagram of a launching sequence for an Apollo moonlanding mission, using a Nova launch vehicle. Nova\'s\nfirst two stages would fall back to Earth after burnout.\nThird stage would escape Earth with Apollo capsule, but\nwould not be guided to moon along with Apollo.\n\nlimited room in which to move about. It will weigh between\n15,000 and 20,000 pounds.\nA remarkable aspect of the Apollo spacecraft is the fact\nthat the crew will not wear space suits. Space suits such as those\nused in Project Mercury become uncomfortable after a time.\nFor one thing, the pressure provided in the Mercury suit is only\nslightly more than one-third normal Earth-surface pressure,\nadequate for one-day missions in space but not for two-week\nmissions such as Apollo will perform. The Apollo command center will be pressurized at about two-thirds normal sea-level\npressure, permitting the crew to operate in "shirtsleeve environment" for as long as fourteen days.\n110\n\nThe systems within the capsules will generally be similar\nto those in the Mercury capsule, but of much more advanced\ndesign. In addition to the pressurization and the breathing oxygen system, the capsule will have air conditioning, equipment to\nremove exhaled carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other wastes,\nplus food and water supplies. The protective equipment will\nnecessarily be much more complex than that of Mercury, because (1) it must provide an artificial environment for three\nmen instead of one, and (2) it must operate flawlessly for fourteen days. The capsule will be completely sealed. Its oxygen\nand water must be used over and over in a "recycling" process.\nThe Moon Suit\n\nAlthough space suits will not be used in flight, they will be\non board for emergency use and for the lunar landing. Again,\nthe suit will be far more complex than the Mercury suit. It will\nhave to operate independently of the systems in the command\ncenter, since the astronauts will have to leave the capsule to\nexplore the moon. The suit will have external tanks of oxygen\nfor breathing and pressure, and its own compression and pumping system to force the oxygen into the suit. It will also have\nbuilt-in communications equipment, so that the astronauts can\ntalk to each other or to the Earth control station.\nThe command center will have all the controls for guiding\nand maneuvering the spacecraft, and, of course, a very accurate\nnavigation system augmented by an electronic computer to\nhelp the navigator make the necessary calculations.\nProtection Against Radiation\n\nRadiation protection will be provided in a number of ways.\nFirst, all of the spacecraft\'s complicated equipment will be\ncompactly grouped around the crew stations, so that the metal\nin these systems will afford a degree of protection. Secondly, the\nspacecraft must carry large supplies of water for drinking, cooling, and other purposes. These water tanks can also be ar111\n\nranged around the crew stations, since water can reflect some\nradiation. The crew will also wear water-filled jackets, like life\nvests. Finally, there will be one or more layers of metal shielding all around the capsule, sufficient to provide protection\nagainst all radiation except giant solar flares.\nThe second of the four building blocks is the basic propulsion unit, a cluster of two or more fairly large rocket engines\nwith the necessary fuel and oxidizer tanks, valves, and pumping\nequipment. For Apollo Phase One, the Earth--orbiting training\nmissions, this unit provides the braking force for re-entry into\nthe atmosphere and it is also used for maneuvering in orbit. For\nPhase Two, the trip around the moon, this same unit will be\nused to make course corrections. It can also provide the braking\nthrust to allow the spacecraft to enter moon orbit, and the extra\nthrust required for leaving the lunar orbit to return to Earth.\nIn the case of the lunar-landing mission, this rocket build-\n\n[\nThe drawing, left, depicts Nova launch vehicle, planned for\nexpeditions to moon, Mars, or other planets. Capable of putting\n70-ton load into escape orbit (90 tons into Earth orbit), the\nNova system could put three men on the moon and return them\nto Earth. At the same time, it could leave 20 tons of supplies\nand equipment on the moon to support a later manned station.\nThe first or booster stage of Nova may actually be a cluster\nof eight F-i kerosene rockets. Developed originally for Saturn\nbooster, each F-i produces 1,500,000 pounds of thrust. The\nsecond stage would use either two F-i engines, or eight hydrogen-fueled types of 200,000 pounds thrust each. Two hydrogen\nengines would make up the third stage. Using a nuclear-powered final stage, a Nova-launched probe could circle Mars and\nreturn to Earth. At right, the artist has shown Nova third-stage\nlanding on the moon, "backing down" on its rocket thrust. This\nstage would carry men and their observatory.\n\n112\n\nOVA LAUNCH VEHICLE\n\ning block is the most important component of the whole spacecraft. It will provide the thrust to blast the spacecraft away\nfrom the moon. Obviously, it must be the most reliable engine\nthat can possibly be built, complete with a number of emergency systems in case of failure of any part. Should it malfunction, the crew would be stranded on the moon.\nThe third building block is another propulsion stage, a\nlarge and powerful rocket cluster to be used only on the lunarlanding mission. This is the power plant which will slow down\nthe spacecraft as it approaches the moon and lower it gently\nto the lunar surface. This section alone, with at least four engines and tankage, will be about sixty feet long. Again, performance must be completely reliable, since failure would result in a lunar crash.\nThe fourth building block is a complete space observatory,\ncontaining optical and radio telescopes and instruments for\nmaking\' a variety of human-directed measurements in space.\nThis section, large enough to contain the equipment and at\nleast one crew member, will be an extension of the basic section,\nthe command center. For the long, tedious moon mission, this\nsection provides extra "stretching room" and sleeping area.\nThus, depending on the mission, either two, three, or four\nof these building blocks can be joined together. The command\ncenter and the propulsion unit will be used on all missions. The\nobservatory will be added for special scientific Earth-orbital\nmissions and for the lunar mission, and the large auxiliary propulsion unit will be attached for the lunar landing.\nObviously, the total weight of the complete spacecraft will\nvary, depending on which sections are joined, so that the\nlaunch-vehicle requirements differ. For the Earth-orbiting mission, the launch vehicle will be the basic Saturn. For the circumlunar flight, the advanced Saturn will be employed. And\nfor the lunar landing, the huge three-stage Nova will be the\nlaunch vehicle.\n114\n\nThe Manned Lunar Landing\n\nSometime in the next ten years, three men will leave Earth\non the most dramatic flight in history, the lunar landing. Some\nof the details may be changed as a result of continuing research,\nbut here, in general, is what it will be like.\nAs it rests on its launch pad, the tremendous space vehicle\n- mighty Nova and its payload, the lunar spacecraft - will\nstretch higher into the sky than a thirty-story skyscraper. On\nthe very top, looking tiny by comparison, is the command center containing the three astronauts with the smaller "back\nroom," the observatory, attached. Immediately below it is the\nbasic propulsion unit. Next, proceeding downward, is the long,\ncylindrical multi-rocket power section for the lunar backdown,\nand below it the third, second, and first stages of Nova.\nThe multiple engines of Nova\'s lower stage will ignite with\nan incredible roar. Slowly, the huge vehicle will lift spaceward,\npicking up speed rapidly. Acceleration forces will push the\nastronauts deep into their foam-rubber couches; they will\nweigh, for a brief period, several times their normal poundage.\nNow the lower stage has exhausted its fuel. It automatically\ndisconnects and falls toward the Earth. For a short time, the\nremaining vehicle coasts upward on momentum, then the\nsecond-stage rockets ignite, pushing the vehicle still faster.\nMore than one hundred miles up, the second stage burns out,\ndisconnects, tumbles Earthward. Another brief coasting period\nand the third stage goes into action, thrusting the vehicle ever\nfaster - 20,000, 21,000, 22,000 miles per hour!\nThe guidance system, which has functioned since launch,\nhas directed the spacecraft into a very precise path. Now the\nthird stage of the launch vehicle, its work done, separates; because its velocity is too great, it will not return to Earth but\nwill follow the spacecraft into space. The spacecraft is on its\nown, coasting on momentum at 25,000 miles per hour. The\nastronauts are weightless; the momentous voyage has begun.\n115\n\nEn Route to the Moon\n\nThe spacemen take their stations and immediately start\nwork on the complicated navigation problem and their scientific\nobservations. The spacecraft continues to coast without power,\ngradually losing speed but still moving at a very high velocity\ntoward its rendezvous with the moon.\nFor more than a day the spacecraft coasts toward the\nmoon. The crewmen, in constant touch with Earth, describe\nevery detail of the great flight. The navigator is constantly\nmeasuring the altitudes of the various stars, feeding the information into his computer, carefully plotting the course. On\nEarth, tracking stations are following the spacecraft.\nDuring the long voyage, the astronauts take turns sleeping, strapped to their couches, so they will not float around the\nspacecraft, because they will be weightless all the way to the\nmoon. Food and water are also weightless, so they will eat and\ndrink from squeeze containers.\nIt is now time for the mid-course correction. The control\nrockets are ignited, the correction made, and the rockets shut off.\nAlmost two days from Earth, it is time for the final correction. The spacecraft radio picks up the beam from the beacon\nat the moon landing site, deposited there a few days earlier by\nan unmanned spacecraft. Another blast on the control jets and\nthe spacecraft is on "terminal approach."\nNow the spacecraft must be oriented. By precise manipulation of the controls, it is turned around so that the lunar landing rockets are pointed downward. The spacecraft has slowed\nconsiderably during its two-day trip; but it is still moving at\nmore than 2,000 miles per hour, and lunar gravity is now starting to take over, pulling Apollo moonward.\nThe rockets of the lunar landing stage blast out their powerful thrust. The spacecraft slows gradually, backing down to\nits landing site. The craggy, "pock-marked" surface of the moon\ncomes closer, closer. The astronauts are manipulating the con116\n\n^_i\t\n\nAi\n\ntrol jets to insure a stable descent. The main descent rockets\nare still blasting, overcoming the\nlunar gravity. The shock-absorbing landing legs are extended.\nWith a slight jolt, the spacecraft\ntouches down.\nMan on the Moon\n\nWith awe and wonder difficult to imagine, the astronauts\ndon moon suits and descend to\nthe grim, forbidding, airless terrain of Earth\'s natural satellite.\nThe astronauts, either pilots\ntrained as scientists or scientists\ntrained as spacemen, will proceed with a series of observations.\nThey will venture as far as\nthey dare from the spacecraft,\nexploring the ancient terrain.\nThey will weigh only one-sixth\ntheir normal weight, because .of\nthe lower lunar gravity, so even\nin the bulky moon suit they will\nbe able to cover several yards in\na single step. They will map the\nterrain features in the vicinity of\ntheir landing site and probe beneath the lunar surface. They\nwill analyze samples of surface\nminerals. They will set up telescopes and study the sun and\n\nI.,. &lI:fltCWIVlt.r\n\nAn experimental "moon suit," designed to protect its wearer against\nheat, cold, and radiation. It carries\nself-contained atmosphere and\ncommunications system.

All of their findings\nwill be relayed continuously to Earth.\nThe length of the astronauts\' stay on the moon on this first\nmission has not been finally determined. Theoretically, their\nspacecraft and moon suits will provide a livable environment\nfor almost ten days, but the possibility of a failure in some part\nof the system increases with the duration of the visit, so it\nappears advisable to cut the visit short. On the other hand, the\nlunar landing site will not always be visible to Earth radio and\noptical telescopes, since the moon is moving around the Earth\nand the Earth is itself rotating. It is important that the launch\ncenter or other Earth tracking stations watch the lunar take-off,\nso that Earth assistance can be provided for navigation on the\nreturn voyage. Several days might elapse before the moon is in\nthe proper position for such tracking, so, barring emergency,\nthe first lunar visit will probably be five days to a week.\nThe Homeward Voyage\n\nThen comes the crucial return.\nOn the launching from Earth, there were hundreds of people on the launch pad and in the control center, checking every\nitem to insure absolute perfection. Now there are but three.\nThey must examine every component to insure perfect working\norder and plot the course for moon escape.\nAs it sits on the surface of the moon, the spacecraft consists of the four building blocks. On top is the command capsule,\nbelow it the observatory, next the basic propulsion unit, finally\nthe lunar landing stage. This latter stage has done its work; it\nis no longer needed. It is uncoupled, to remain forever on the\nmoon, a monument to the first U.S. manned lunar landing.\nEverything checked and double-checked, the escape\nrockets are ignited. The spacecraft - now considerably lighter,\nwith no atmosphere to combat, and with only one sixth of Earth\'s\n118\n\ngravity to overcome - hurtles into space toward Earth.\nAgain there is the two-day journey with mid-course corrections, as the spacecraft is directed into the narrow corridor for\nthe Earth landing. This time, however, instead of slowing\ngradually, it picks up speed all the way home, from slightly\nmore than 5,000 miles per hour as it leaves the moon to 25,000\nmiles per hour as it reaches Earth.\nA few hundred miles from Earth, the spacecraft is again\noriented so that the rockets are pointed toward Earth. They are\nignited, braking the spacecraft with a sudden jolt. The astronauts are again pushed down into their couches by the force of\ndeceleration, similar to that experienced during acceleration on\nthe Earth launch.\nThe propulsion unit has exhausted its fuel; it falls off,\nleaving only the man-carrying capsule, which plummets into\nthe atmosphere, slowed considerably by the braking rockets\nbut still moving at tremendous speed. The re-entry heat mounts\nto high intensity, but the heat shield absorbs it. Air resistance\nslows the capsule, until, at about 10,000 feet, it is traveling\nonly a few hundred miles per hour. Parachutes are released,\nthere is a slight jolt, then the capsule drops gently to the surface.\nDoes it sound too fantastic for belief? A few years ago, this\nflight would have been labeled "sheer nonsense." Today, the\nfull-time efforts of thousands of people are being directed\ntoward early fulfillment of this great dream. It will happen and it will happen before you are ten years older!\n\n119\n\nExploration\nof the\nSolar\nSystem\nMERCURY\n\nJUPITER\nSUN\t\n\nMARS\n\t\n\nI)\nSATURN \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nASTEROIDS \\\nEARTH\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nI\n\nUCH is the inquisitive nature of the human mind, that even\nS before the manned lunar landing becomes a reality, people\nwill be looking beyond it to see what is next on the space\nagenda.\nThe follow-on goals are easily defined; the methods of\naccomplishing them are considerably less clear.\nUnder consideration as the next step after the initial lunar\nlandings is construction of a permanent space station in Earth\norbit. Such a station would greatly simplify the first lunar landing, by eliminating the requirement for tremendous launch\nvehicles like Nova and permitting a larger payload to be sent\n\n\\\\\nPLUTO\n\n\\\\\t\n\nURANUS\n\nI\t\n\n/\n\nNEPTUNE\n\nMan knows only his home planet, Earth. Will he ever reach the others?\n\nto the moon. However, starting from the point of current knowledge and technical developments, it is less difficult to launch the\ninitial manned lunar spacecraft from Earth than it is to develop the techniques of orbital rendezvous necessary for construction of the space station. It will also take time to build the\ntype of re-usable space truck needed to ferry the various parts\ninto position.\nDuring the years of preparation for the manned lunar\nlanding, research in these areas will progress. It is possible that\nthe large, permanent space station can be built shortly after the\nstart of the next decade.\nThe Lunar Base\n\nThere is, of course, a permanent space station already available - the moon. Although space scientists have not yet determined whether the utility of a base on the moon justifies the\ngreat effort required to build it, the lunar base might prove\ndesirable for a number of reasons. First, it may have potential\nas a platform for deep space penetrations by manned spacecraft.\nSecond, a permanent moon station may have military potential\nin defense of our nation. Third, a thorough scientific examination of the moon can be accomplished in a relatively short time\nfrom a lunar base. To accomplish the same task by individual\nexpeditions would take many, many years and trips.\nThe lunar base, then, may become the next step after the\nEarth-orbiting space station. With current and foreseeable technology, it should be feasible to build such a base. There are,\nhowever, many problems, chiefly the task of hauling to the\nmoon-all materials and supplies needed to create and sustain\nan artificial Earth environment for a great many people. Obviously, before a program of this magnitude can be started, we\nneed a great deal more information about the moon and its\nenvirons. Such information will be obtained through the long\nseries of manned and unmanned missions.\n122\n\nThe Mariner spacecraft, designed for a\n"close" (16,000 miles) fly-by of the\nplanet Venus. Its instruments will send\nback data on the magnetism, radiation,\nand atmospheric composition of Venus.\nSun and Earth sensors combined with a\ncold gas jet system will keep Mariner\noriented so that its solar cell paddles are\nalways turned toward the sun and its\ndirectional antenna toward Earth. A\nliquid-fueled rocket motor, fired on command from Earth, will enable course\ncorrections to be made for a close fly-by.\n\n123\n\nTomorrow\'s Space Goals\n\nAfter the lunar base, the next goals are manned and unmanned investigations of our sun and of space outside the\necliptic, the plane in which Earth revolves in its orbit around\nthe sun. The most distant space goals currently foreseeable are\nexplorations of the other planets within the solar system, in\nthe order of their distance from Earth: first, Venus and Mars;\nnext, Mercury; after that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and\nPluto. Also of great scientific interest are the asteroids, chunks\nof space matter largely concentrated between the orbit of Mars\nand Jupiter. Most of these asteroids are afew miles in diameter,\nbut some are a hundred miles in diameter. The largest, known\nas Ceres, has a diameter of 500 miles. Since they are believed to\nbe the remains of one or more exploded planets, they may provide important information on the origin of the solar system.\nThe problems of manned visits to these planets should be\napparent from the foregoing discussions. They stem largely\nfrom the incredible distances involved. Thus, sending manned\nspacecraft to the planets will require \'a whole new order of\ntechnology. If we applied the lunar-mission technique (launching the spacecraft to escape velocity and permitting it to coast)\nto a Pluto trip, the minimum launching velocity would be\n88,000 miles per hour and it would take the spacecraft fortysix years to reach the distant planet. Therefore, for practical\nexploration of the distant planets, the basic requirement is a\npropulsion system (such as electrical propulsion) capable of\nsustained operation over a long period and also capable of\naccelerating the spacecraft to such staggering speeds as a million miles or more per hour.\nAs for the spacecraft itself, we need not dwell on the incredible requirements. From our discussions of the relatively\nsimple manned lunar spacecraft, you can imagine the complexity of the systems needed to sustain a crew of spacemen for\nvoyages requiring several months, and to protect them from\n124\n\nmeteorite hits, giant solar flares and other radiation, and possible new hazards of space flight not yet discovered.\nEven after the problems of interplanetary-spacecraft design and propulsion have been solved, there remain other problems. With the possible exception of Mars, the planets themselves are environments hostile to manned exploration. Mercury,\nnearest the sun, has surface temperatures as high as 750 degrees\nFahrenheit on its "hot" side, while the other side, in perpetual\ndarkness, has temperatures several hundred degrees below zero.\nVenus, next closest to the sun, has temperatures estimated at\nabout 500 degrees and the evidence now available indicates\nthat its atmosphere is poisonous to human beings. Massive\nJupiter, more than 1,300 times the size of Earth, has an escape\nvelocity of more than five times that of Earth, making a landing\nextremely hazardous and a take-off all but impossible. In addition, its tremendous gravity would crush a human being without some form of protection not yet foreseeable. The other\nPlanets offer similar natural problems, in addition to the problems of reaching them.\nIt is obvious, then, that even the space within our solar\nsystem will not submit readily to conquest. There are few who.\ndoubt, however, that man will eventually penetrate to the\nlimits of our solar system. The first requirement is a greater\nknowledge of the planets, the space between the orbits of the\nplanets, the sun, and the cosmic matter that comes from beyond\nour solar system.\nThe lunar-exploration program will provide considerable\ninformation in these areas. But long before the lunar landing,\nunmanned exploration of the planets will get under way.\nThe Mariner Spacecraft\n\nThe first step is a series of unmanned planetary spacecraft\nidentified by the code name Mariner. Mariner is similar in design to the lunar Ranger, although it is larger and heavier (it\nwill weigh slightly more than half a ton).\n125\n\nMariner\'s initial target, in 1962, will be the planet Venus,\nEarth\'s nearest neighbor except for the moon. Because Venus\nis veiled by a dense cloud cover, its surface has never been\nseen. The surface temperature, the composition of the cloud\ncover, and the planet\'s rate of rotation about its axis - about\nwhich we can only guess - are of great scientific interest.\nBoosted into space by the Centaur launch vehicle, Mariner\nwill attain sufficient speed to escape from Earth and coast to\nthe vicinity of Venus. It will not impact on the planet, but will\nmake a "fly-by," passing within 27,000 miles.\nOne of the major instruments in the Mariner spacecraft\nwill be a spectroscope, to examine the mysterious cloudy atmosphere of Venus and transmit data\' on what elements are\ncontained in this atmosphere and in what ratio. The spectroscope will also search the Venusian atmosphere for the presence\nof oxygen and water vapor. Mariner will also contain a magnetometer to determine the strength of Venus\' magnetic field,\ninstruments to sample the radiation surrounding the planet and\na radiometer for surface temperature readings.\nAfter Venus, Mariner\'s next target is Mars. The primary\nquestion is whether life exists on the "red planet." The spacecraft will carry instrumentation similar to that for the Venus\nmission, with additional instruments designed to find out\nwhether the Mars surface contains organic molecules that\nwould indicate the presence of life. Since the Martian atmosphere is clear, like Earth\'s, the Mariner spacecraft will -also\ncarry television cameras to "look at" the surface of the planet.\nThese data, when telemetered back to Earth, will provide photographic details not obtainable by Earth telescopes.\nThe Voyager Spacecraft\n\nAfter a series of Venus and Mars missions with the Mariner\nspacecraft, to take place during 1962-66, a new type of spacecraft called Voyager will take over. Voyager, considerably\nlarger and much more advanced than Mariner, will be launched\n126\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\nI\n\nU)\n\nF\t\n\nC\nW\n>\nI0\n\nLi\n-J\nC\')\naC-)\n\nU)\n\nC\n0\n\n/a\n\nU)\n\n4-.\n\nC\na,\nE\n\nz\n0\nz\n\n/\n\n4U)\n\nC\n\n"U\nI/U\nV.\n\nU)\n\nC\n4-.\n\n0\n\nU)\n\nw\n>-\n\nV\nC\n\nI-\n\nU)\n4-.\n\nC.,\na,\na,\na,\n\n.0\n0\naCu\na,\nC\n\n4-.\n\nCu\n\naa,\nC\n\n4-.\n\nV\na,\nC\nC\nCu\n\nE\nC\n\n0\n\n2\n4\n\nUi\nz\n\n-J\n\nby the big Saturn booster. Its targets, in the years 1964-67, will\nalso be Venus and Mars, but Voyager will be capable of acquiring more detailed information by orbiting the planets for long\nperiods of time and continuously relaying information to Earth.\nVoyager will also carry a secondary spacecraft, a capsule designed to make soft landings on the planet. It will telemeter\ninformation about the lower atmospheres of the planets as it\ndescends to a landing, and about surface conditions after\nlanding.\nWork is already proceeding on the Voyager concept, but\nspace planners have not yet decided on the step to follow. It\nappears likely, however, that Venus and Mars exploration will\nfollow the lunar pattern. If so, the follow-on program would\nbe a large planetary spacecraft like the lunar Prospector, capable of hovering over or moving about the surfaces of Venus\nand Mars to add new volumes of data about our neighbor\nplanets. Since both Venus and Mars have atmosphere, spacecraft of this type would need aerodynamic lift features and\nentry-heating protection. In design they would more closely resemble manned spacecraft like Apollo than unmanned vehicles\nsuch as Surveyor and Mariner.\nDeep Space Probes\n\nIn the latter part of the decade of the sixties, we can expect the start of a similar series of missions to Mercury and\nJupiter, the next nearest planets to Earth. Here again the stepby-step procedure, employing spacecraft of increasing sophistication, will be followed.\nAnd, after Mercury and Jupiter, space scientists will turn\ntheir attention to the sun, space outside of the ecliptic, and then\nto the more distant planets - Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and\nPluto. Little can be said today of what form these unmanned\nspacecraft will take, since they will come in a new decade\nwhich may also bring the permanent space station and electrical\npropulsion. These achievements will result in changes of most\n128\n\nof the components of the spacecraft. The type of information\nneeded about these planets, however, is similar to that sought\nfrom Venus and Mars.\nFinally, when new forms of propulsion have been developed, tested, and proved reliable, and when all the problems\nof keeping man in space for extended periods have been resolved, manned exploration of the solar system will get under\nway. It is difficult to estimate with accuracy the date for the\nfirst planetary expedition. We must first await accumulation of\nall the data from the lunar exploration program and its attendant preliminary steps, and from the unmanned planetary\nand interplanetary probes. On the basis of current knowledge,\nit appears that a manned mission to Venus could not be undertaken before 1975, but "breakthroughs" in propulsion and other\nareas of intense research effort could change the estimate.\n\n129\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n-M Aip\n\'\n\n-\n\n$4\n\nN\n"S.:.\n\n4\n\n4\n\n,\n\n-\n\nYA\nI\n\n\'\n\n\'\'w \xe2\x80\xa2:\n\nd\n\t\n\nEWIIM\n\n4\n\n-\n\n4\'\t\n4.\t\n\n-\n\n\t\n\nHE accomplishments of the early sears of the Space Ago\nT may have given an exaggerated impression of man\'s ability\nto"conquer" space.

Yet, even with the\ngreatest predictable advances in space-flight techniques, the\ntask appears all but insurmountable.\nThe Speed of Light\n\nThe barrier to exploration of the universe lies in the distances to the stars, distances so great that it is difficult for the\nhuman mind to grasp them. Even a billion miles is too puny\na measure of distance in outer space; we must employ the lightyear, or the distance light travels in one Earth calendar year.\nLight moves at a velocity of 186,300 miles per second, so a lightyear is 186,300 times sixty seconds, times sixty minutes, times\ntwenty-four hours, times 365 days, or almost six trillion (6,000,000,000,000) miles.\nAt the speed of light, distant Pluto, the farthest planet in\nour solar system, is only six hours and forty-five minutes away.\n132\n\nOur star, sun, is but one of a hundred billion or more stars that\nmake up our galaxy, the Milky Way.\nFrom edge to edge, the Milky Way\nis thought to measure 100,000\nlight-years. At the center, it is\n10,000 light-years thick.\nWILLIAM MEVERRIECKS\n\nTo get an idea of the distances involved in universal space, take\na look at the familiar North Star, Polaris. Polaris is 300 lightyears distant. The light you see left Polaris 300 years ago. Yet\nPolaris is practically a next-door neighbor.\nThe Milky Way\n\nAs a portion of the universe, our entire solar system is infinitesimally minute. Proxima Centauri, the star nearest our sun,\nis four and one-quarter light-years away. These two stars - our\nsun and Proxima Centauri - are members of a galaxy we call\nthe "Milky Way," a grouping of an estimated hundred billion\nstars. The Milky Way is so immense that it would take a spacecraft moving at the speed of light 100,000 years to traverse its\nlength.\nThe Milky Way galaxy itself is but one of about two dozen\ngalaxies in what is called the "local" group. We can see the\n133\n\nlight from the Andromeda galaxy, another member of the local\ngroup - this light has been traveling through space for 700,000\nyears! And in the universe there are uncountable groups of galaxies, at distances so vast that even the light-year becomes an\ninadequate measurement.\nThe Barrier to Interstellar Exploration\n\nYet, according to currently accepted scientific theory, the\nspeed of light is a limit beyond which no particle can be accelerated. Even if such a velocity were possible, it would take\nalmost nine years to make a round trip to Proxima Centauri, the\nnearest star. If a particle of matter traveling at nearly the speed\nof light had started at one end of the Milky Way on the day\nChrist was born, it would not yet be one fiftieth of the way across\nthe galaxy.\nIn the area of deep-universe travel, any speculation at this\ntime is meaningless. Man simply does not have the knowledge\nto consider methods for real penetration of the universe.\nWhether we can ever achieve exploration of the universe must\nremain for the time being a suspended question. It will, most\nlikely, take a new order of human intelligence even to contemplate the solutions to such an awesome problem, and no one can\npredict when man can reach that level of intelligence.\nYet, to the optimist, the feeling that interstellar and intergalactic travel will come is inescapable, scientific barriers aside.\nOne has only to ponder all the "impossibles" which have already occurred. In discovering the New World, Columbus\nachieved the impossible, although some "scientific" opinion held\nthat he would sail off the end of the Earth. Only a hundred\nyears ago, ffight itself was "impossible." As recently as 1945, in\nthe enlightened twentieth century, a number of persons in\npositionsto "know" stated authoritative opinions that the speed\nof sound - a mere 760 miles per hour - was an absolute limit\nto aircraft velocity. Today, twice the speed of sound is routine\nfor military aircraft and within the decade airline passengers\n134\n\nL1\n\nAnd beyond our galaxy\xe2\x80\x94there are others extending to the\nvery edge of the visible universe, to the edge of imagination. Still, they beckon us.\n\nwill be flying at these speeds. And what of space flight itself how recently was it "impossible"? Who knows what "impossibles" tomorrow\'s science will make routine?\nSmall as it is in terms of universal distance, our own solar\nsystem holds myriad secrets, the unlocking of which will provide a source of fascination and countless benefits to the generations privileged to live in this great age of science and technology. We have front row seats to witness the most dramatic\nadventure of all time, the exploration of solar space, and we\nmay be alive to witness the sequel.\n135\n\nInvitation\n\nIdeas\nfor\nProjects\nand\n11v9eriments\n\nES, it\'s true you can\'t build your own Apollo or Explorer\nY spacecraft. If you are wise, you will wait until you are an\nengineer to try to launch your own explosive-propelled rocket.\nBut there are things you can do to join the teams of creative\nand inventive people who are having the fun and excitement\nof getting ready for space travel.\nBegin now to look into the things which make space travel\npossible. Take some steps toward understanding the problems\nthat must be solved to get a spacecraft through the Earth\'s\natmosphere and back again without burning up. Find out what\nit really takes to have a spacecraft pull away from - or develop\nforces equal to - the Earthward attraction of gravity. Learn\nhow difficult it is to balance forces acting on an object in such\na way that it will move in a curved path.\n\nYou can learn to recognize some of the signposts that space\nnavigators use to keep track of objects moving in space. Get to\nknow the kind of curved paths that spacecraft are likely to\ntravel.\nThe activities which follow have been developed by people\nwho like to use their hands as well as their heads - by people\nwho like to have the satisfaction of knowing they can build\nthings that really work. And so can you!\nGetting Through the Earth\'s Atmosphere\n\nIt is not easy for a man to leave the Earth\'s surface and\n\nB\n\n\t SHOULD FIT TIGHTLY\nBALSA WOOD MODEL\r\nN UNDERGOING DRAG TEST\n\nPULL MADE STOP-\\\n\t\nFROM SPOOL\t\n\nSCALE USED\nTO COMPARE\nRESULTS OF\nDIFFERENT\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nFLEXIBLE SUPPORT\nMADE OF STEEL STRAP\nPLACE WEIGHTS IN PAN OR SPRING\nTO MEASURE DRAG\nDRAWINGS IN THIS SECTION BY HORACE GILMORE\n\nFigure 1.

The problems to be solved\nare almost as difficult as those a fish would encounter if it were\nto leave its water habitat and try to climb or fly into the air to\nlive with the birds. Since it has neither wings for flying nor\nfeet for crawling, a fish would have to propel itself while still\nin the water to such a great speed that its momentum would\ncarry it through - for at least a brief visit into the air.\nThe faster an object moves through any fluid - such as air\nor water - the greater the resistance or drag effect the object\nencounters. In addition to speed, the drag on an object moving\nthrough a fluid depends upon the density of the fluid and the\nsize, shape, smoothness, and other features of the object itself.\nFigure 1 shows a device that you can build and use to study\nthe effects of various factors on the drag of model spacecraft\nhulls of your own design.\nExperiments can be planned using different shapes of test\nmodels, all of which have the same weight, or models of the\nsame shape and dimensions but having different weights.\nModels that are identical except for the condition of their surfaces can be compared. The effects of different shapes of nose\ncones can be determined. You may try filling the balloon with\ncarbon dioxide or some other gas to see if the density of the\nfluid makes any difference in the amount of drag it causes .on\none or more different spacecraft models.\nIf you want to specialize in the study of drag, the formula\nis D = C d p V2 A. In words, the drag (D) of an object is equal\nto the drag coefficient (C d ) times one-half the fluid density (p)\ntimes the square of the velocity of the fluid (V2 ) times the\nfrontal area (A).\n138\n\nPulling Away from the Earth\'s Gravity\n\nWhen we think about the scientific problems of space\ntravel, many things we take for granted here on Earth assume\na new importance. Gravity is a good example. Can you imagine\nwhat a chaotic place the world would be if gravity could no\nlonger be relied upon to keep things where they have been put?\nAlthough gravity seems at times to be a handicap, it has its\ndesirable effects. Even the pole vaulter or high jumper is better\noff with gravity acting on him. He may have to give a mighty\neffort to get off the ground, but he would be in worse trouble\nclawing space madly to get down again if gravitational forces\nwere to disappear.\nEach time we step on a scale to see how much we weigh,\nwe are measuring the pull Earth\'s gravity exerts on the mass of\nour bodies. But the true nature of gravitational force can be\nbetter described than explained. It is known that all objects in\nthe universe are attracted to one another by a force that decreases as the objects become farther apart and increases if the\ntotal mass of the objects increases.\nA change of distance between the center of Earth and the\ncenter of an object will result in a change of weight of the\nobject. For example, an object that weighs 240 pounds on the\nsurface of the Earth might weigh only sixty pounds if it were\nto be shot into space so far that it would be twice the distance\nfrom Earth\'s center. An object on Earth\'s surface is about 3,960\nmiles from the center of Earth. Using the previous example, can\nyou calculate the weight of the object at 11,880 miles from\nEarth\'s surface?\nAlthough airplanes travel through the atmosphere because\nof both the resistance and lift provided by the pressure of the\n139\n\nair, spacecraft must be propelled by forces that act even where\nthere is no air. Propulsion can be achieved by harnessing the\nso-called action-reaction principle. This is the same kind of\naction that causes a boat to be kicked away from you if you try\nto step away from it to shore without first securing it to a dock.\nThe action-reaction principle can be seen in the skittering\nof an inflated balloon when it is released. Try carving different\nshapes of "exit nozzles" to insert in the neck of a balloon to see\nif one shape is better than another in keeping the balloon moving longer or farther. Figure 2 suggests two shapes. The 15-45degree nozzle is the shape that seems to be the best for actual\nrocket motors.\n\nFigure 2. Carve different shapes of "exit nozzles" from\nbalsa wood or plastic. Attach to balloons to determine\neffect of nozzle on gas release velocity, thrust.\nThe moon orbits constantly around the Earth; in a sense, it\nhas pulled away from the Earth\'s gravity. As long as the gravitational attraction between the moon and Earth is balanced by\nthe moon\'s orbital velocity, the moon neither falls toward the\nEarth nor wanders farther from it. The moon\'s orbit has re-\n\n140\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 mained nearly constant for centuries.\nTo study the forces which act on an object that is moving\nin a \'circular path, drive a roundhead screw into a golf ball or\nhard rubber sponge ball. Tie strong twine or fishing line to the\n\xe2\x80\xa2 screw. Grasp the twine twelve inches from the ball. Whirl the\nball fast enough to keep the ball "in orbit," that is, so that it\nwill not fall toward your fingers when it reaches the top of its\npath. Count the number of circles it makes at the minimum\nspeed during one minute.\nLet go of the string while the ball is in orbit. Notice that\nthe ball does not continue to circle but flies off in a straightline tangent to the circle.\nNow grasp the twine twenty-four inches from the center\nof the ball. Again whirl the ball at the slowest speed that will\nkeep the ball in orbit and count the number of circles per minute. Make the same kind of count when the twine is thirty-six\nor forty-eight inches long. You will notice several things. about\nthe action of the ball, including the changing pull on your\nfinger. Calculate the velocity for each orbit. Do you suppose\nthe weight of the ball has anything to do with the number of\ncircles per minute required to keep the ball in orbit?\nTry the same experiment with the.twine running through\na spool. Attach a small weight to the end opposite the ball.\nEstimate the number of rotations per minute required to support the weight at various radii.\nIt is this balancing of gravitational force and the velocity\nof the ball that keeps objects in space from falling toward or\n\xe2\x80\xa2 away from other planets, the sun, or other stars.\nTo see how .this works, cut a plywood\' disc the size of \xe2\x80\xa2a\ntwelve-inch phonograph record. In the center of this disc, drill\n141\n\nWOODEN DOWEL\nBALLS OF DIFFERENT\r\nHOLE IN DOWEL\t\n__.IIIIf1I...SIZES ARE CONNECTED\nFITS CENTER PIN\n______\t\nWITH STRING\nON TURNTABLE\n\n12 Is PLYWOOD DISC\n\nFigure 3. Here is device to explore relation between orbital velocity and gravity. Spin on turntable.\na hole large enough to take a three-inch length of half-inch\ndowel (Figure 3). Drill a horizontal hole through the upper\nend of the dowel. Before gluing the dowel to the plywood\n"record," drill a hole up through the center of the dowel so that\nthe record can be placed over the pin on a record player and\n"played." Find two wooden, rubber, or plastic balls of different\nsizes. Pass a string through one ball, then through the horizontal\nhole at the top of the dowel, and through the second ball. Start\nthe record player and see if you can balance one ball against the\nother so that the string moves neither way through the dowel.\n(These experiments will not work on a record changer, only on\na turntable.)\nYou can use the plywood record for two more investigations. Fasten a rubber band to a golf ball or other small rubber\nor wooden ball. Change the speed of the record player, and\nsee if there is a change in the distance the ball stretches the\nrubber band while it is turning.\nFasten a post near the edge of the disc (Figure 4). Hang\na small ball from the top of the post. Observe the ball when the\nrecord is turning at various speeds. You will see that when gravi 142\n\nDOWEL\n12" PLYWOOD DISC\t\n\nBALL\nSUPPORTED BY\nSTRING\n\nFigure 4. Plywood record is modified for more experiments.\n\ntational forces alone act on the ball it simply hangs at the end\nof the string but when the proper speed of rotation is reached,\nthe ball is kept suspended in "space."\nSpeed and Distance\n\nAn object moving over the surface of the Earth at about\n25,000 miles per hour develops enough velocity to prevent it\nfrom falling to the Earth. Indeed, at this speed, the force\ndeveloped is of sufficient magnitude so that the object can\n"escape" from the gravitational pull exerted by the Earth.\nIt is interesting to see how the speed of an object is related\nto the horizontal distance it covers before falling to the Earth\'s\nsurface. Figure 5 shows a device that lets you study this relationship.\nOne of the most interesting things to see with your rocket\nlauncher is the relationship between distance traveled by a\nmodel and the amount of force used to launch it. Measure the\ndistance traveled by a model after it has been launched with\nvarious amounts of force. If you can devise a way to estimate\nthe length of time the model spent in flight, you can divide the\n143\n\ntotal distance by the time and obtain the average velocity or\nspeed of the model. This may give you a good idea of what an\nescape velocity of 25,000 miles per hour really means.\n\nCARDBOARD MAILING TUBE OR\nALUMINUM TUBE WITH SLIT\t\nALONG ENTIRE LENGTH\n\nMODEL ROCKET\nIN TUBE READY\nFOR FIRING\t\n\nr RUBBER BAND\r\n\nSCALE\nPER\n\t COMPARISON\r\nOF VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS\n\nFigure 5. This device permits you to explore relation\nbetween flight distance and force at launch. With strobe\nlight and camera you can also study ballistic paths. Can\nyou figure out method to determine velocity?\n\nObjects Moving In Curved Paths\n\nThe curved path or trajectories of spacecraft are likely to\nbe more apparent to us than the curved paths of objects moving\non or near the Earth\'s surface. In fact, such words as circles,\nellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas will be common words to\nspace travelers. Figure 6 shows the shape of each of these\ncurves.\nIt is interesting to see how each of these curves can be\n44\n\nproduced by cutting a cone as shown in Figures 7 through 10.\nA cone can be made from modeling clay, balsa wood, or plaster\nof Paris. If clay or plaster is used, make a form by folding heavy\npaper into a cone and securing the edges with transparent tape.\nIf the cone is filled with some material that "sets," remove the\npaper form just before it becomes hard, then cut the cone with\na fine.wire along the planes as indicated in the figures. By sawing the wire back and forth carefully, a smooth, clean cut can\nbe made.\nIt is interesting to see what combinations of forces and\n\nFigure 6. Path of space vehicle depends upon the velocity\nimparted by rockets through time last stage is fired. If\nvelocity equals or exceeds escape velocity, path is openended parabola or hyperbola. Lower velocities result in\nelliptical or circular paths.\n145\n\ncircumstances are required to cause an object to move in each\nof the different kinds of curved paths. To follow a circular path,\nfor example, the forces acting on a moving object must act in\nsuch a way as to keep the object always the same distance from\na point.\nBut what about the ellipse? How does an object manage\nto stay in that kind of path? You can answer this question if\nyou simply draw an ellipse. Figure 11 shows how.\nWhen you draw an ellipse you can see that the sum of the\ndistances from a point (the moving pencil point) to two fixed\npoints (the two pins) always remains the same because the\ncircumference of the loop of string always remains the same\nlength.\n\nCIRCLE\t\n\nELLIPSE\t\n\nPARABOLA HYPERBOLA\n\nFigures 7-10 .The form and mathematical relationships of\nthe curved paths of spacecraft can be studied in models\ncut from a cone. An analytical geometry text will give you\nformula for the curves.\n146\n\nSTRING LOOPED\nAROUND PINS\nPINS\n\nFigure 11. In drawing ellipse, sum of distances from moving pencil to two fixed pins remains constant.\n\nThe parabola is as easily described but is more difficult to\ndraw. By description, an object will move in a parabolic path\nif it moves in such a way as to remain equidistant from a point\nand a fixed straight line.\nIf you draw a parabola by the method shown in Figure 12,\nyou will see that the length of the string from the moving point\n(pencil) to a fixed point (pin) is always equal to the distance\nfrom the moving point to a fixed line (straight edge).\nTo understand how a spacecraft manages to stay in a circular, elliptical, or parabolic path, you must recognize that\nforces act on the moving spacecraft and create the same over-all\neffect as that which caused your pencil to follow a similar\ncurved path when you drew these same curves. Of course, it\ntakes better imagination to see fixed points and fixed lines in\nspace than it takes to see pins or straight edges fixed to a drawing board.\n147\n\nSTRING IS FASTENED\nTO TIP OF TRIANGLE\nAND TO PIN\n\nFigure 12. If you draw a parabola by the method shown\nabove, you must take care to keep the string taut as the\ntriangle is moved up and down straight edge.\n\nTo Find One\'s Way in Space\nTo find your way in any situation you need familiar landmarks or guideposts that are either always in the same place,\nor have predictable, regular movements. In space, directions\nand locations are established by using planets, the sun, or other\nstars as the "landmarks" and guideposts.\nTo be able to find and recognize the stars important for\nspace navigation is not only necessary for anyone who hopes\nto find his way in space, but it is also fun for those who will\nspend all of their lives here on Earth. Astronomers have very\naccurate ways of locating a star at any instant in space. Because\n148\n\n\t\n\nthe apparent position of any star in the sky depends on where\nthe observer is, the date, and the time the star is being observed, the methods used to locate a star are a bit complicated.\nHere is a device (Figure 13) you can build that will let you pin-\n\n90 0 ANGLE BETWEEN\nCENTER LINE OF SIGHTING\nTUBE AND CENTER LINE\nOF SUPPORT\n\nCENTER LINE OF SIGHTING\nTUBE SHOULD BE DIRECTLY\nABOVE POINTER\n-\n\nFINE WIRE ACROSS OPENING\nCOMPASS\nPERMITS SCALE TO BE Rj\nACCURATELY\n\nI[\n\n.7i\n\nBOLT WITH WING N\n^\n\niu"c\t\n\n\t 1\t\n\n7\n\nf\t\n\nBUBBLE LEVEL IS FLUSH I J\t\nSO THAT MOVABLE SIGHTING\t\nBLOCK MOVES FREELY\n\ni\n\nc-\n\n360\xc2\xb0 SCALE\n\nTRIPOD WITH\n\nA\' ADJUSTABLE LEGS\nW\n\nFERRULE WITH SPIKE\n\nFigure 13. Star finder requires two basic parts: one\nmeasures angle between horizon and star; the other\nmeasures angular displacement from true north. Note\n\nthat 3600 scale is fixed.\n\n149\n\npoint any star that is normally visible from your own spot on the\nEarth\'s surface.\nOne of the easiest and most valuable things to do with\nyour star finder is to measure the altitude of the North Star.\nThis not only tells you the latitude of your location but also\nlets you line your star finder toward true north. You can then\nset the zero degree mark of the full circle scale on true north\nand swing the viewing tube around to mark the location of any\nother star. Here are some questions you can answer with the\nhelp of your star finder:\nIs there any other star in the sky that stays at the same\naltitude and direction the way the North Star does? Suppose\na star is exactly east of you at an altitude of 400 (angular elevation above the horizon) at 8:00 P.M. Where will this star be at\n9:00 P.M.?\nWhen you locate the position of a star one night at a particular time, will the star be in exactly the same spot the next\nnight at the same time? How long does it take for a star that\nappears to be in a position directly overhead to move around\nthe sky and return to the same position?\nYou may find it interesting to team up with other people\nwho live in other parts of the country and compare what you\ncan find out about the stars with your star finder. You can explore such questions as: What is the altitude of a star as observed by someone in California when its altitude as observed\nin. New York is 65 degrees? How far south of you is a person\nwho observes the altitude of the North Star to be 10 degrees\nless than it is where you observe it?\nHere\'s another question: Two people who live several\nmiles apart, but at the same latitude, observe the same star\n150\n\nat the same instant. Can the observed difference in altitude be\nused to determine how far the two observers were from each\nother at the time of the observation?\nYour star finder can be used to make interesting observations about the movement of the moon and the planets. There\nis, of course, much more to be learned before you will be able\nto use the positions of the stars as guideposts for travel in space.\nBut finding the answers to easy questions is the best way to get\nready for the difficult ones.\nYou will very probably make your first acquaintance with\nthe stars by learning to recognize the constellations and then\nassociating the important stars with their constellations. One\nof the best ways to become familiar with star constellations is to prepare two-inch by two-inch photographic slides of the constellations. Project the slides on a wall or ceiling, and observe\nthem until they are quite familiar. Here is a way to make a set\nof constellation slides.\nLoad a camera with the fastest film available. Films such\nas Ansco Hypan or Agfa Isopan Record require exposures of\nabout fifteen seconds. Attach the camera to a tripod and aim it\nat the constellation you want to have for your slide. Focus at\ninfinity and with the shutter set on "bulb" or "time," expose for\nabout fifteen seconds. Longer exposure times yield streaks\nrather than sharp points.\nAfter your film has been returned from the processor,\npunch very small holes through the film at the points where\nthe stars appear. Try to match the brightness of the star with\nthe size of the hole. When you project the constellations, these\nholes will let light come through. When you make slides, record\nthe date, time, altitude, and azimuth for each constellation.\n151\n\nMore Things to Do\n\nUntil you can see familiar objects removed from the effects\nof atmospheric pressure, humidity, gravity, and the other environmental factors on Earth, you will probably never realize\nhow much these factors affect their.properties. You may not\nrealize, for example, that many things retain, their shape because they are being constantly bombarded by air particles, or\nthat a liquid evaporates slowly because its molecules only occasionally find room among the other molecules above the surface\nof the liquid. If there were an absence of air above the liquid,\nmight not the liquid evaporate almost instantly?\nPerhaps you have already seen what will happen to a syrup\nor varnish can if it is filled with steam, closed tightly, and then\nthe steam is suddenly condensed to water. With only a little\nwater in the can and air under very low pressure, pressure on\nthe outside completely crushes the can. The next time you see\nthis demonstration, slip a small air-filled rubber or plastic ball\ninto the can and see what happens.\nBecause people need continuous supplies of oxygen-rich air\nto breathe, water to drink, food to eat, and heat to keep them\nwarm, life in space holds many problems. In addition, waste\nmaterials must be eliminated and most people seem to need\nfamiliar sights and company if they expect to stay in good\nmental health. To bring all of these problems into the open,\nperhaps you can design a large poster or chart to show how\nmany of the things we have in a modern home to maintain our\nhealth and comfort that would not work at all in a space environment that lacks air pressure, gravity, and humidity. Are\nthere some things that would work even better in space than\n152\n\nthey do here on Earth? How about mercury vapor or fluorescent\nlights?\nThe first efforts to place spacecraft in orbit and to make\nmanned explorations in space are among the important events\nof the twentieth century. You may want to keep an event-byevent chart showing the date of each satellite and space probe\nas it was shot into space.\nOne type of a chart could be made by using aluminum\nclothesline wire that can be easily cut and bent to form the\norbital paths of spacecraft. Don\'t expect, however, to show the\nwhole path followed by those objects which apparently went\ninto orbit around the sun.\nSince so many people know how much fun it is to make\nscale models of interesting and famous aircraft, all we will do\nhere is to mention the similar fun you can have in making\nauthentic scale models of the Explorers, Pioneers, Atlases,\nSaturns, and all of the other rockets and spacecraft that are\nhelping man add space to his conquered frontiers.\nAs you look forward to travel in space, you doubtlessly\nthink about the meteors and meteorites which whizz constantly\nthrough space. Meteors are interplanetary debris that enter\nEarth\'s gravitational field and are drawn toward its surface.\nThey sometimes become visible when heated to incandescence\nby the friction of the atmosphere. Meteorites are large or small\nmasses which. survive their fiery trip through the atmosphere\nand land on the Earth\'s surface. Astronomers estimate that approximately 185,000,000 meteors large enough to leave visible\ntrails streak across the skies each twenty-four-hour period. Most\nof the meteorites which reach the Earth are mere specks but the\nweight of a day\'s catch has been estimated at over one ton.\n133\n\nYou may combine meteor hunting with practice in identifying the constellations or watching for the passage of a new\nsatellite. Or, you can combine your photographing of star constellations with an attempt to catch a "falling star" on film. If\nyou try to photograph a meteor, load your camera with fast film.\nFind a spot where stray lights from houses, cars, or aircraft\nwon\'t fog your film, then point your camera toward the sky.\nSecure the camera firmly to a tripod or other support, open\nthe shutter, and leave it open for several hours. When the film\nis developed, you may find a meteor\'s trail cutting across the\ncircular star trails. Be patient; you can expect only about one\nmeteor to appear on your photograph for each hundred hours\nof exposure time. You may have somewhat better luck during\nthe Perseid meteor showers that are visible in the northern\nhemisphere during late summer.\n\n154\n\nSELECTED READINGS\nBerkner, Lloyd V., and Odishaw, Hugh, editors, Science in Space.
