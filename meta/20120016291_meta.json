The iPhone app (Satellite Insight) was created for the GOES-R Program. The app describes in simple terms the types of data products that can be produced from GOES-R measurements. The game is easy to learn, yet challenging for all audiences. It includes educational content and a path to further information about GOESR, its technology, and the benefits of the data it collects. The game features action-puzzle game play in which the player must prevent an overflow of data by matching falling blocks that represent different types of GOES-R data. The game adds more different types of data blocks over time, as long as the player can prevent a data overflow condition. Points are awarded for matches, and players can compete with themselves to beat their highest score.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120016291, "id": "3e12a00e13d844baab283d2ba29e8a0e", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, October 2012", "publicationDate": "2012-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20120016252, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, October 2012", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120016291.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120016291/downloads/20120016291.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120016291/downloads/20120016291.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120016291/downloads/20120016291.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
