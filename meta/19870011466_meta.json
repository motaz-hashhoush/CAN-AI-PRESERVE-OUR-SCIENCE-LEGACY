Access to this database can be gained through the SMM Vax 750 computer at Goddard Space Flight Center. One useful way to do this is with a program called USEARCH. This program allows one to make a listing of different types of UVSP experiments. It is evident that this program is useful to those who would wish to make use of UVSP data, but who don't know what data is available. Therefore it was decided to include a short description of how to make use of the USEARCH program. Also described, but not included, is a listing of all UVSP experiments showing mass motions in prominences and filaments. This list was made with the aid of the USEARCH program.", "title": "Searching the UVSP database and a list of experiments showing mass motions", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T09:21:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870011466, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Thompson, William"}, "organization": {"name": "Applied Research Corp.", "location": "Landover, MD, United States"}}, "id": "c3e2d1dea6b3496f813a73de170700fd"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870011466, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870011466, "id": "ba2f4292d4a44013bc4d6e79c197b86a", "publicationName": "NASA.
