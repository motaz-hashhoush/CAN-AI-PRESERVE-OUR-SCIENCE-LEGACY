The pole housing 16 contains a telescopically arranged and arcuately shaped primary pole member (22) and extension pole member (23) which are guided by roller assemblies (30,35). The extension pole member (23) is slidable and extendable relative to the primary pole member (22). For actuation, a spring actuated system includes a spring (52) in the pole housing. A locking member (90) engages both pole members (22,23) through notch portions (85,86) in the pole members. The locking member selectively releases the extension pole member (23) and the primary pole member (22). An internal one-way clutch or anti-return mechanism prevents retraction of the extension pole member from an extended position. Shock absorbers (54)(150,152) are for absoring the energy of the springs. A manual backup deployment system is provided which includes a canted ring (104) biased by a spring member (108). A lever member (100) with a slot and pin connection (102) permits the mechanical manipulation of the canted ring to move the primary pole member. The ring (104) also prevents retraction of the main pole. The crew escape mechanism includes a magazine (60) and a number of lanyards (62), each lanyard being mounted by a roller loop (68) over the primary pole member (22). The strap on the roller loop has stitching for controlled release, a protection sheath (74) to prevent tangling and a hook member (69) for attachment to a crew harness.", "title": "Orbiter escape pole", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080008810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Goodrich, Winston D."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "e7e048f8d77c4071827343304171f78a"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20080008810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wesselski, Clarence J."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "744d694497984ec6aa5a12075a244a5c"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20080008810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pelischek, Timothy E."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "429cb4bef3bb4d82bf723dd546791b75"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 20080008810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Becker, Bruce H."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "160c0128137942dfb028b966020efe9f"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 20080008810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kahn, Jon B."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "ac6d446fe19f49e68854f9cb54e808c6"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 20080008810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Grimaldi, Margaret E."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "419c87ac3c07408f9354e5283512a2b9"}, {"sequence": 6, "submissionId": 20080008810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "McManamen, John P."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "62a41e0f38414590b08bceff66a47604"}, {"sequence": 7, "submissionId": 20080008810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Castro, Edgar O."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "3d266cbf21a942b3b68c23dadd6fa8e0"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080008810, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080008810, "id": "ca7a16f3fd314f29b0c5c88e11dd53f1", "publicationDate": "1989-12-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080008810.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080008810/downloads/20080008810.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080008810/downloads/20080008810.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080008810/downloads/20080008810.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
