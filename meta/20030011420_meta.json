The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate the capability to perform a manually controlled landing in the presence of a crosswind. Changes in gastrointestinal function and physiology as a result of spaceflight affect drug absorption and the bioavailability of oral medications, which can compromise therapeutic effectiveness. This DSO will lead to the design and development of effective pharmocological countermeasures and therapeutic adjustments for spaceflight. A previous observation suggested that discordant sensory stimuli caused by an unusual motion environment disrupted spatial orientation and balance control in a returning crewmember by triggering a state change in central vestibular processing. The findings of the current investigation are expected to demonstrate the degree to which challenging motion environments may affect post-flight (re)adaptation to gravity.", "title": "Detailed Test Objectives (DTOs) and Detailed Supplementary Objectives (DSOs)", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T01:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030011420, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030011420, "id": "f821008b89df4832b6c9049f42b02f02", "publicationName": "STS 107 Shuttle Press Kit: Providing 24/7 Space Science Research", "publicationDate": "2002-12-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20030011376, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "STS 107 Shuttle Press Kit: Providing 24/7 Space Science Research", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
