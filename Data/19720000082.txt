Explosives\nare ordinarily used as an energy source to produce\nhigh velocities, but since detonation rates are of the\norder of 9 km/sec, some method must be found to\nincrease the effective detonation rate.\n\nThe solution:\nSheet explosive and a metal tube are fitted to the\ninner periphery of a cam-shaped chamber.\n\nHow it's done:\nA cam-shaped cavity is machined in a heavy block\nof metal, as indicated in the diagram; a heavy metal\ncover is fabricated to fit over the cavity block. The\n(continued overleaf)\n\n-.\t\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\t\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States \t\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\ncover must be capable of being tightly fastened to\nthe cavity block with strong bolts. The depth of the\ncavity is sufficient to accommodate the outer diameter of a thin metal tube that is closed at one end\nand made to conform with the shape of the cam.\nA hole at the position shown in the diagram is bored\nthrough the cover so that the bottom end of a small\ncylindrical detonator (a blasting cap) can come into\ncontact with the surface of the sheet explosive. In\norder to assure detonation, a metal backing plate is\nlocated below the explosive and in line with the axis\nof the blasting cap.\nA thin sheet of commercially available explosive is\ncut to fit the inner contour of the metal tube and\nthe exposed sides of the cam-shaped cavity, as indicated in the diagram. Two spacers of the same shape\nare cut; the spacers may be made of any convenient\nmaterial, e.g., cardboard, which has a thickness such\nthat a sandwich of the two spacers plus the sheet\nexplosive equals the outside diameter of the metal\ntube. The spacers locate the sheet explosive in approximately the same plane as the center-line of\nthe metal tube.\nWhen the detonator is energized, the detonation\nwave initiated in the explosive begins to travel radially outward. During each unit of time, the wave\ntravels a uniform distance d as indicated in the diagram. The closed end of the metal tube will receive\nthe detonation wave first; then each part of the tube\n\nwill receive the wave front in succession with the\nopen end receiving it last. The action resembles the\nextrusion of toothpaste from a tube. Note, however,\nthat during time interval 11, the detonation wave\nhas compressed the metal tube along a length K in\nthe same time interval that the detonation wave\ntraveled radially the distance d; clearly, the rate of\ncollapse of the tube is much greater than the detonation rate.\nThe contour of the cam-shaped surface can be\nvaried so as to give a desired rate of collapse which\nis controllable between wide limits.\n\nn\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nNASA Pasadena Office\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, California 91103\nReference: TSP72-10082\n\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: Abraham H.
