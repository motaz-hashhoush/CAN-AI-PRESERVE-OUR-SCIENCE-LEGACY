Rice is an important food worldwide. Worthwhile goals, particularly for developing nations, are the capability to recognize from satellite imagery: (1) areas where rice is grown, and (2) growth status (irrigation, vigor, yield). A two-step procedure to achieve this is being investigated. Ground truth, and ERTS-1 imagery (four passes) covering 80% of a rice growth cycle for some Philippine sites, have been analyzed. One-D and three-D signature extraction, and synthesis of an initial site recognition/status algorithm have been performed. Results are encouraging. but additional passes and sites must be analyzed. Good position information for extracted data is a must.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730020525, "id": "f9111848dcda4dc98636ee7ed92d5a45", "publicationDate": "1973-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19730020525.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19730020525/downloads/19730020525.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19730020525/downloads/19730020525.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19730020525/downloads/19730020525.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
