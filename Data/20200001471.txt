Whether it holds a record\nof ancient life, is the food for extant life, or\nhas existed in the absence of life, organic\nmatter in martian materials holds chemical clues\nto planetary conditions and processes.\nPrior reports of organic matter indigenous to\nmartian sediments include 150 to 300 parts per\nbillion (ppb) of chlorobenzene, with lesser amounts\nof C2 to C4 dichloroalkanes, detected in Sheepbed\nmudstone upon heating to <400\xc2\xb0C by the Sample\nAnalysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite of the\nMars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission (1). Martian organic carbon may have also contributed to\nCO and CO2 pyrolysis and combustion products\nevolved below 700\xc2\xb0C from various sediments by\nSAM (2, 3). Chloromethanes detected in Viking\xe2\x80\x99s\npyrolysis gas chromatography\xe2\x80\x93mass spectrometry\n(GC-MS) analysis of martian regolith have been\nreinterpreted as having a martian origin (4). Additionally, indigenous organic matter in martian\nmeteorites [e.g., (5)] is related to a deep igneous\ndomain excavated by impact events. Although\nthese reports indicate the presence of martian\norganic matter, they do not constrain our understanding of ancient organic matter in sediments.\nExploration of the lowermost exposed sedimentary rocks at the base of Aeolis Mons in Gale\ncrater by the Curiosity rover has led to the discovery of a finely laminated mudstone succession,\nthe Murray formation, that is interpreted to record deposition in a long-lived ancient circumneutral to alkaline lake fed by a fluviodeltaic\nsedimentary system (6\xe2\x80\x938). Mudstones are composed of basaltic minerals mixed with phyllosilicate, sulfate, iron oxide, and x-ray amorphous\nEigenbrode et al., Science 360, 1096\xe2\x80\x931101 (2018)\n\ncomponents (7). The ~3.5-billion-year-old Gale\nlake environment(s) are expected to have been\nideal settings for concentrating and preserving organic matter (9).\nDrilled samples delivered to SAM were heated\nat ~35\xc2\xb0C/min to ~860\xc2\xb0C. Evolved gas analysis\n(EGA) continuously and directly measured bulk\ngas composition during heating with the mass\nspectrometer. A portion of the evolved gas from\nthe same sample was trapped and analyzed by\nGC-MS for molecular identifications (10, 11). Here\nwe report the analysis of gases evolved at high\ntemperatures (>500\xc2\xb0C) from the Mojave and Confidence Hills sites. We also make comparisons\nwith Sheepbed and other Murray mudstones.\nFigure 1, A and B, shows mass-to-charge ratio\n(m/z) profiles for the release of organic sulfur\ncompounds from Mojave samples. The profiles,\nwhich are indicative of particular compounds or\nfragments of similar structures, reached their\npeak between 500\xc2\xb0 and 820\xc2\xb0C, consistent with\nthe presence of thiophene (C4H4S), 2- and 3methylthiophenes (C5H6S), methanethiol (CH4S),\nand dimethylsulfide (C2H6S). The presence of\nbenzothiophene (C8H6S), a bicyclic thiophene\nthat usually co-occurs with thiophenes, is also\nsuggested by a weak peak in both Mojave (Fig.\n1A) and Confidence Hills (fig. S1F) EGA data.\nOther volatiles\xe2\x80\x94carbonyl sulfide (COS), CS2 ,\nH2S, SO2, O2, CO, and CO2 but not H2\xe2\x80\x94evolved\nconcurrently (Fig. 1, C to E). A similar release of\norganic sulfur compounds and related volatiles\nwas observed for Confidence Hills (fig. S1).\nOther, nonthiophenic, aromatic compounds\nwere also detected in EGA of Mojave (Fig. 2B)\nand Confidence Hills (fig. S2F) samples. The temperatures of peak release and the correspond-\n\n8 June 2018\n\n1 of 5\n\nDownloaded from http://science.sciencemag.org/ on December 18, 2019\n\nEstablishing the presence and state of organic matter, including its possible biosignatures,\nin martian materials has been an elusive quest, despite limited reports of the existence\nof organic matter on Mars. We report the in situ detection of organic matter preserved in\nlacustrine mudstones at the base of the ~3.5-billion-year-old Murray formation at Pahrump\nHills, Gale crater, by the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite onboard the Curiosity\nrover. Diverse pyrolysis products, including thiophenic, aromatic, and aliphatic compounds\nreleased at high temperatures (500\xc2\xb0 to 820\xc2\xb0C), were directly detected by evolved gas\nanalysis. Thiophenes were also observed by gas chromatography\xe2\x80\x93mass spectrometry. Their\npresence suggests that sulfurization aided organic matter preservation.\nAt least 50 nanomoles of organic carbon persists, probably as macromolecules containing\n5% carbon as organic sulfur molecules.\n\ning representative molecular groups are ~800\xc2\xb0C\nfor benzene (C6H6) and ~750\xc2\xb0C for toluene (or\ntropylium ion C7H7+), with two peaks at 625\xc2\xb0 and\n790\xc2\xb0 to 820\xc2\xb0C for alkylbenzenes (C8H9 or benzoate ion C7H5O\xe2\x88\x92) and possible chlorobenzene\n(C6H5Cl) (supplementary text). A peak near detection limits in the Mojave data suggests that\nnaphthalene (C10H8) may also be present, assuming that the Confidence Hills blank (fig. S2E) is\nrepresentative of noise levels.\nEGA mass profiles for m/z 15, 26, 27, 29c [where\n\xe2\x80\x9cc\xe2\x80\x9d indicates a profile correction to remove contributions from other volatiles (11)], 30, 41 to 43,\n55 to 57, and 69 to 71 from Mojave (Fig. 2A) and\nConfidence Hills (fig. S2B) samples are consistent\nwith a 550\xc2\xb0 to 820\xc2\xb0C evolution of aliphatic compound products composed of C1 to C5 chains or\ntheir branched moieties. Correlation and relative\nintensities of peaks suggest molecular structures\nthat differ by single carbon additions (\xe2\x80\x93CH\xe2\x80\x93,\n\xe2\x80\x93CH2\xe2\x80\x93, and \xe2\x80\x93CH3 additions), which are characteristic of an array of aliphatic fragments from\nlarger molecules (12) and commonly observed in\nhigh-temperature pyrolysis products of terrestrial kerogens and coals (13) and carbonaceous\nchondrites (14). Some structures may contain\nN- and O-bearing groups, such as amides or carboxyl or carbonyl groups, but these cannot be\nclearly identified in EGA because mass spectra\nare not resolvable in EGA and other molecules\nshare the diagnostic m/z values.\nThree temperatures or ranges characterize the\npeaks of the aliphatic compound signals in the\nMojave data (Fig. 2A): 625\xc2\xb0C (square), 750\xc2\xb0C\n(circles), and 790\xc2\xb0 to 820\xc2\xb0C (triangles). Immediately preceding the 750\xc2\xb0C peak set is a notable O2 release from sulfate decomposition (3),\nwith an increase in CO2 (Fig. 1E) suggesting that\ncombustion limited to the most ignitable volatiles (12) occurred in parallel with pyrolysis. It\nis also possible that portions of the CO2 and CO\n(Fig. 2A) were derived from the decarboxylation\n(2, 3) and decarbonylation of larger organic compounds, which have been observed for Murchison\nmacromolecular isolates (15). The same three\npeaks are present but less discernable in Confidence Hills data, where the 750\xc2\xb0C O2 peak is\nlower, suggesting that combustion was less influential on hydrocarbon evolution (fig. S1 and S2).\nAbundance estimates for thiophenes, C1 and\nC2 sulfur, and aromatic and aliphatic compounds\nin Mojave and Confidence Hills samples are in the\nnanomolar C range (Table 1) (11). The total organic\ncarbon (TOC) abundance in these samples (10 to\n100 nmol of C) reflects only the portion detected in\nEGA and does not account for any char remaining\nin the samples after heating. Calculated TOC\nabundances are considered lower limits for the\nactual amounts of organic carbon in the samples.\nOrganic sulfur and aromatic and aliphatic\ncomponents evolve between 550\xc2\xb0 and 820\xc2\xb0C\nand share peak maxima (noted by symbols in\nFigs. 1 and 2 and figs. S1 and S2). This matching indicates the presence of diverse molecular\nstructures in organic matter of the Mojave and\nConfidence Hills samples. Peaks for aromatic or\nthiophenic volatiles in the Sheepbed and other\n\nR ES E A RC H | R E PO R T\n\nular identifications for the small amounts of\naromatic compounds indicated by the EGA data.\nAliphatic compound identifications in GC-MS\ndata for Mojave and Confidence Hills do not\nreflect those observed in EGA. Generally, the\nstrongest m/z values in mass spectra of aliphatic\ncompounds are from the C2 to C5 fragments of\nparent molecules with larger carbon structures.\nThus, the disparity between EGA and GC-MS\ndata is largely attributable to C2 to C5 fragment\ncontributions from a large molecular pool in\nEGA, which renders identification of any one\nmolecule below detection limits by GC-MS, as\npreviously described for aromatic compounds.\nThe SAM EGA instrument background is not\nthe source of the molecular diversity observed at\nhigh temperatures (supplementary text). Sample\nsignals are significantly greater than blanks. Laboratory tests demonstrate that in the presence\nof silicates and perchlorates, instrument background has little effect on signals above 550\xc2\xb0C\n\n(fig. S7). Other possible but unlikely contamination sources cannot account for the temperature\nbreadth and the molecular diversity observed.\nLastly, C5 structures suggested by m/z profiles\ncannot be explained by SAM\xe2\x80\x99s instrument background, which is limited to C1 to C4 backbones.\nThe diversity, composition, and temperatures\nof coevolving volatiles observed in the Mojave\nand Confidence Hills analyses above 500\xc2\xb0C are\nconsistent with the pyrolysis of geologically refractory organic macromolecules that are typically found in carbonaceous chondrites (14, 15),\nkerogens (17), and coals (18, 19). The more stable\nthese macromolecules are, the higher the temperature needed to thermally cleave fragments\nfrom them. Pyrolysis of organic matter-laden sediments with co-occurring inorganic materials\nthat also decompose or act as catalysts can result in a complex array of chemical reactions\nduring heating, including sulfurization, addition, cyclization, and condensation (Diels-Alder\nFig. 1.

S1 to S6) are weaker and\nless defined and have inconsistent temperatures,\ndespite a clear indication of aliphatic compound\npresence. Thiophenic and aromatic compound\nabundances for these mudstones are less than\n50%, as observed for Mojave and Confidence\nHills samples (table S1). In the Cumberland sample of the Sheepbed mudstone, thiophene abundances are equivalent to or less than values for\nblanks, indicating their absence.\nGC-MS analysis of the 226\xc2\xb0 to 860\xc2\xb0C cut of\ngases released from Mojave (Fig. 3) confirms the\npresence of thiophene, 2-methylthiophene, and\n3-methylthiophene. Dimethylsulfide was observed\nin all GC-MS analyses (table S2). The abundance\nof thiophenes detected in Mojave by GC-MS is\n20 (\xc2\xb15) pmol of molecules (table S2), which is\nequivalent to ~100 pmol of C, indicating 10 times\nless thiophenic C than in EGA. The difference\nreflects a combination of contributions from\nother unknown molecules [e.g., for the m/z 84c\nprofile (Fig. 1A), other thiophenic or sulfur aromatic compounds and C6H12 fragments from\naliphatic chains with fewer than six carbons, and\nfor the m/z 97 profile, C7H13 fragments or HSO4\xe2\x88\x92\ncleaved from aliphatic and aromatic sulfates]\n(12, 16) in EGA, leading to inflation of calculated\nEGA abundances; incomplete hydrocarbon trapping by the SAM hydrocarbon and injection traps\nof the GC system because of interference from\nother volatiles; and incomplete release from\nflash heating of the injection trap.\nGC-MS confirmations of molecular identities\nassigned to EGA aromatic signals are limited.\nBenzene, alkylbenzenes, naphthalene, and chlorobenzene are observed in GC-MS data for Mojave and Confidence Hills, but molecules from\nthe GC instrument background contribute to\nthese signals, and the GC detections likely include contributions evolved at low temperatures\n(<500\xc2\xb0C) because of the broad GC cut (table S2).\nSample-to-sample carryover is also known to\naffect low GC-MS signals (1). Together, these\nissues make distinction among small amounts\nof high-temperature, sample-derived aromatic\nmolecules difficult. Moreover, because peaks in\nEGA profiles reflect the sum of hydrocarbon\nfragments with a characteristic structure that\nare contributed by numerous, low-abundance\npyrolysis products, signals of individual molecules can be significantly lower in GC-MS. Such\ndiverse molecular contributions are consistent\nwith the complex chemistry of meteoritic and geological organic matter and the interactions that\noccur during pyrolysis of sediments (12). The\nMojave and Confidence Hills GC-MS data do not\nand are not expected to provide unequivocal molec-\n\nR ES E A RC H | R E PO R T\n\ntype) reactions that may produce cyclic structures (thiophenes and other aromatics). Sufficient\nHe flow mitigates these secondary reactions. In\nspite of this complexity, larger molecular fragments can maintain structural information regarding the parent organic matter (12, 13). In\nMojave, CO, COS, CS2, CH4S, and C2H6S likely\nreflect cleavage directly from the precursor organic structures and reaction products. Similarly, CO2, H2S, H2, and H2O may be derived\npartly from organic matter in addition to mineral decomposition (3, 20). However, under\nSAM oven conditions at high temperatures and\nlow pressure under flowing He, entropic factors\ngovern reactions (12, 21, 22), and the formation of thiophenic and other aromatic volatiles in\nthe oven is not favored. This conclusion is supported by EGA blank analyses that indicate\nthe absence of cyclic structures (fig. S2) despite\n\navailable reactants from the background organic molecules (fig. S7) and by the absence of\nthiophenes in EGA data for the sulfide-bearing\nCumberland sample of the Sheepbed mudstone,\nindicating that no cyclization occurred (table\nS1). Thus, the thiophenic and aromatic volatiles\nlikely reflect compounds directly released from\norganic matter in the Murray mudstones. It is\nvery plausible that aliphatics and some portion\nof the C1 and C2 sulfur compounds also reflect\nthe in situ sample chemistry. Even if some portion of these compounds are not direct pyrolysis products from sediments, their carbon must\nlargely be derived from organic matter indigenous to martian sediments.\nThe weaker and less diverse organic signals\nof the Sheepbed and other Murray mudstones\nindicate that the sediments had less organic input at the time of deposition or that the organic\n\nEigenbrode et al., Science 360, 1096\xe2\x80\x931101 (2018)\n\n8 June 2018\n\n3 of 5\n\nDownloaded from http://science.sciencemag.org/ on December 18, 2019\n\nFig. 2.

Profiles in\n(A) are grouped by carbon\nnumber and shifted\nalong the y axis for clarity.\nProfiles for aromatic\ncompounds in (B) are\nsimilarly shifted. Plotting\ndetails are as described\nin the legend to Fig. 1 (11).\n\ninputs were more substantially degraded over\ngeological time. Organic materials in the lacustrine mudstones at Yellowknife Bay and in the\nlower Mount Sharp group strata have survived\nmultiple aqueous diagenetic events (6\xe2\x80\x938), though\nthe number and extent of these are difficult to\nconstrain. Further, direct and indirect reactions\ninduced by ionizing cosmic rays degrade organic\nmatter (23), and SAM measurements of noble\ngas isotopes in the Sheepbed mudstones indicate that the sediments have been irradiated for\n~80 million years, implying substantial degradation (24). It is possible that the Murray mudstones experienced less exposure.\nWithin the lower Murray mudstones at Pahrump\nHills, sulfide minerals were likely altered to jarosite\n(1 to 3% in Mojave and Confidence Hills) by acidic\ndiagenetic fluids (pH 2 to 6) ~2.1 billion years ago\n(25), though it is unclear whether these fluids\nwere localized to sediment grains (8) or were more\npervasive in the strata, leaching mafic minerals\nof metals and increasing in pH as they passed\ndownward through the section (7). In either case,\nthe exposure must have been limited in time and\nspace, as pH-sensitive minerals such as apatite\nand olivine persist. Acidic fluids can effectively\noxidize exposed organics; however, acidic diagenesis in the lower Murray may have had a small\neffect on organics, as it did on pH-sensitive minerals. If these fluids moved downward through\nthe Pahrump Hills section as proposed by Rampe\net al. (7), Confidence Hills and Mojave would\nhave been exposed to only mildly acidic fluids\n(pH 6), resulting in milder organic degradation\nthan that of overlying Murray mudstones. Alternatively, variations in organic matter abundance\nand composition in Murray mudstones may reflect geological inputs from transported detritus that was already in a refractory state, which\nwould support the survival of organic detritus\nexposed to varied lake redox conditions (8). Ultimately, the fate of organic matter is determined\nby both degradation and preservation mechanisms. Both are likely important to the mudstones\nin Gale crater. By what preservation mechanisms\ndid the martian organic matter survive?\nMacromolecules on their own are self-preserving\nbecause surface organics shield interior organics\nfrom oxidation and stabilize the bulk organic mass\n(26). Ancient biomacromolecules deposited in lake\nsediments may have been transformed into geomacromolecules (kerogen) over time. Other possible sources of recalcitrant macromolecules include\ninterplanetary dust particles (IDPs) (27) and abiotic organic materials from igneous rocks (5). In\nan effort to better constrain the composition and\npossible origin of organic matter in the mudstones, we conducted SAM test bed EGA of the\nMurchison meteorite, a proxy for IDP composition, and laboratory EGA of the Tissint martian\nmeteorite, which hosts igneous rock\xe2\x80\x93related organics. Both show the evolution of C1-C2 sulfur\nvolatiles and aliphatic, aromatic, and thiophenic\npyrolysis products during EGA above 500\xc2\xb0C (fig.\nS9 and S10), but the profiles related to these\nmolecular groups are distinctive for each sample\ntype. These results are consistent with the known\n\nR ES E A RC H | R E PO R T\n\npresence of refractory organic matter in each\nmeteorite but indicate differences in the organic\nchemistry and mineral associations of the meteorites. The supplemental EGAs do not provide\nconstraints on organic matter origin. However,\nthey do support the interpretation that the mudstones host refractory organic matter that is most\nlikely macromolecular.\nMinerals can further aid preservation by several mechanisms: occlusion by minerals, organicmineral interactions (e.g., organic binding to\nphyllosilicate and Al-Fe oxyhydroxide surfaces),\nand the establishment of chemically reducing\nmicroenvironments that host organics (28). If\norganic matter entering sediments was labile,\nsuch as autochthonous biomolecules (e.g., carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids), then\nreactions with mineral surfaces or sedimentary\nchemicals would have been favored. Phyllosilicate,\niron oxyhydroxide, and amorphous materials are\nprevalent in all of the studied mudstones (7, 8).\nFurther, iron sulfides detected in the Sheepbed\nmudstone (29) and suspected in the original\nMurray mudstone detritus (7, 8) may have aided\norganic matter preservation by providing an\nadditional oxygen sink during diagenesis.\nReduced permeability limits the exposure of\norganics to migrating fluids and gas. Permeability is generally reduced by abundant fine-grained\nEigenbrode et al., Science 360, 1096\xe2\x80\x931101 (2018)\n\n(C) Chromatograms from GC run in the laboratory. Chromatograms were\nsmoothed, and the off-nominal GC run from Mojave resulted in the 20-s\noffset for the thiophene retention time as observed in (B) (11). The 2,2,2trifluoro-N-methyl-acetamide peak in (B) is a derivatization reaction\nproduct that is part of the instrument background (11). GC-MS identifications\nare based on both SAM and laboratory retention times (table S3)\ncompared to standards and mass spectra in a reference database (33).\nAxis breaks denote a change in the x-axis scale.\n\nsediments and precipitates (e.g., sulfate cement,\nvein fill, and nodules). All mudstones studied\nexhibit indications of groundwater alteration\n(6\xe2\x80\x938, 30); however, the timing of cementation\nand postdepositional aqueous alteration is not\nwell constrained, so the extent of organic exposure to these fluids is unknown.\nMacromolecules, mineral interactions, and\npermeability factors were all likely contributors\nto organic matter preservation in the Murray\nmudstone, but sulfurization of organic molecules\nwas probably the principal preservation mechanism responsible for the distinct record in Mojave\nand Confidence Hills given the presence of 3 to\n10 times as much thiophenic and total organic\nsulfur in these samples as in the other mudstones\n(tables S1 and S4). Natural vulcanization results\nin an enhanced refractory state for organic materials. The addition of sulfur structurally links the\norganic components into a macromolecular form\nand provides an additional oxidative sink for degradation reactions. On Earth, sulfurization enhances initial preservation while also imparting\nlong-term recalcitrance to structural transformations and oxidation, such as during acidic diagenesis. Sulfurization probably occurred during\nearly diagenesis in the presence of reduced sulfur\n(HS\xe2\x88\x92 or H2S) gas (31) more than 3 billion years\nago. The large sulfur isotopic fractionation ob-\n\n8 June 2018\n\nserved in the SO2 evolved via EGA from the\nmudstones indicates that sulfide was transported\nvia hydrothermal groundwater to the Gale lake\nbasin (32). Alternatively, organic sulfur was native to the detritus deposited in the lake.\nSAM\xe2\x80\x99s molecular observations do not clearly\nreveal the source of the organic matter in the\nMurray formation. Biological, geological, and\nmeteoritic sources are all possible. Certainly, if\nancient life was the organic source, then despite\nsulfur incorporation, the material has been altered sufficiently, such as by diagenesis or ionizing radiation (23), to obscure original molecular\nfeatures more consistent with life (e.g., a greater\ndiversity of molecules or patterns of limited\nstructural variation within compound classes,\nsuch as hydrocarbon chains), or an insufficient\namount of organic matter was deposited to allow\ndetection by pyrolysis\xe2\x80\x93GC-MS.\nPast habitability interpreted for the Sheepbed\nlacustrine mudstones focused on chemolithoautotrophy (8, 30), but observations of geologically\nrefractory organic matter in Murray lacustrine\nmudstones opens the door for past and present\nhabitability for heterotrophy as well. Organic\nmatter can directly or indirectly fuel both energy\nand carbon metabolisms and in doing so can\nsupport carbon cycling at the microbial community level.\n4 of 5\n\nDownloaded from http://science.sciencemag.org/ on December 18, 2019\n\nFig. 3.

Even if life\nwas not a key contributor, meteoritic and igneous\nor hydrothermal sources have a strong potential\nto be broadly emplaced. Our detection of organic\nmatter at the martian surface, where ionizing and\noxidizing conditions are extreme, suggests that\nbetter-preserved molecular records may be present\nbelow the surface, where the effects of radiation\nare small, or in materials exposed in the last several thousand years.\n\nOrganic matter preserved in 3-billion-year-old mudstones at Gale crater, Mars\nJennifer L.

Heating the sediments released an array of organics and volatiles reminiscent\nof organic-rich sedimentary rock found on Earth. Most methane on Earth is produced by biological sources, but\nnumerous abiotic processes have been proposed to explain martian methane. Webster et al. report atmospheric\nmeasurements of methane covering 3 martian years and found that the background level varies with the local seasons.\nThe seasonal variation provides an important clue for determining the origin of martian methane.\nScience, this issue p. 1096, p. 1093; see also p. 1068\n\n'
