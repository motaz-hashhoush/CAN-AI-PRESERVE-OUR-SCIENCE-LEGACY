b'Oil Industry Aids\n\nThe accompanying photos show two\ntypes of offshore oil platforms used\nby Exxon Corporation. In the upper\nphoto is a leg-supported gravity platform; the other structure is a "jackettype" platform, built in sections,\ntowed to sea and assembled on-site.\nIn construction of platforms like\nthese, Exxon Production Research\nCompany, Houston, Texas, conducts\nextensive structural investigations of\ndecks, supporting members and other\nplatform components, making use of\nthe NASTRAN (NASA Structural\nAnalysis) computer program.\nNASTRAN is a predictive tool which\nanalyzes a computerized design and\nr$tports how the structure will react to\na\'great many conditions it will encounter in its o~erational\nenvironment; in this case, NASTRAN studies\nthe effects of waves, winds, ocean\nstorms and other stress-inducing\nfactors. NASTRAN allows Exxon\nProduction Research to perform more\ncomplex and more detailed analysis\nthan was possible with previous programs. The same program has also\nbeen used by Exxon Research and\nEngineering Company, Florham Park,\nNew Jersey, in analysis of pressure\nvessels, turbine components and\ncomposite building boards.\n@\n\nNASTRAN is made available to the\nExxon companies through NASA\'s\nComputer Software Management and\nInformation Center (COSMIC), which\nroutinely supplies computer programs\ndeveloped by. NASA and other g&ernment aaencies to interested industrial firms.jn addition to NASTRAN,\nseveral other COSMIC programs have\nfound use among Exxon subsidiaries\nand affiliates. For example, Exxon\nProduction Research has used the\nShip Hull Characteristics Program\n(SHCP) to evaluate the stability and\nstrength of drillships and barges, aiding company selection of vessels to\nbe leased. The same comDanv has\nalso used a program called SMIPS\n(Small Interactive Image Processing\nSystem) to study the potential of satellite imagery in exploring for mineral\nand hydrocarbon deposits. Exxon Research and Engineering Company has\nincorporated a COSMIC subroutine\ninto its Steam Network Program,\nemployed in analyzing energy re-\n\nL\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nquirements for production of petrochemicals. Exxon Company, U.S.A.,\nHouston, Texas, has used COSMIC\'S\nSUPERMON to monitor and help\nimprove the performance of the company\'s computing systems. Collec-\n\ntively, use of COSMIC programs has\nresulted in savings to the Exxon\ngroup running into millions of dollars.\n@ NASTRAN IS a reg~stered\ntrademark of the Nat~onal\nAeronautlcsandSpaceAdrn~nlstrat~on\n\n'
