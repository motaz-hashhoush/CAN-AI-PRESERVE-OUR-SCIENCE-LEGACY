b'NARROW PASSBAND IMAGERY OF COMETS\n\nT. R. Gull\nLaboratory for Astronomy and Solar Physics\nNASA-Goddard Space Flight Center\nGreenbelt, MD 20771\nAbstract\nDuring an emission-line survey of the Milky Way, Comet West was accidently imaged through\nfour different narrow passbands with a wide-field, image-intensified camera. Three passbands\nrecorded very similar head plus tail structure. The fourth passband shows an additional\nlarge, diffuse component around the head. It was serendipitous that such was recorded as the\nfilters, being selected for studies of emission nebulae, are not particularly suited for\nstudies of comets. However the imagery, plus subsequent studies, encourages us to suggest\nthat much can be learned about the structure of comets using narrow passband imagery\nsimultaneously with long slit spectroscopy.\nIntroduction\nImaging through narrow passband filters is certainly not a new concept in astronomy.\nMonochromatic photographs in astronomy of bright planetary nebulae and bright H II regions were\nrecorded nearly thirty years ago. Moreover wide-field imaging and image-intensified photography\nare used often. However, we have recently combined all three concepts into one instrument that\nhas been used to produce an emission line survey of the galactic plane. This nearly uniform\nsample is being used to study a variety of problems concerning the structure of the interstellar\nmedium. Just as this Wide Field Camera (WFC) has proven to be very useful in the studies of very\nfaint galactic emission nebulae, it also has the potential of providing new information on the\nlarge-scale structure of comets.\nIn this paper we describe the instrument and its capabilities. The WFC and/or its filters can\nbe used with other instruments. We have tried simultaneous spectroscopy and direct imagery and\nfind the combination to be a powerful diagnostic. We are able to use the large interference\nfilters with large format image intensifiers on longer focal length telescopes. With a set of\nfilters optimally selected for cometary studies, much new and exciting information should be\nobtainable on dusty structures, plus neutral and ionic distributions.\nThe Instrument\nNarrow passband imagery is normally done at the Cassegrain focus of telescopes, as moderately\nnarrow passbands will not be significantly detuned in slow f-ratio optical beams (f. R. Gull,\nOptical and Infrared Telescopes for the 1990\'s, p. 373). Moreover most optically-flat\ninterference filters are limited to five centimeters in diameter due to manufacturing difficulties\nand the associated costs. Until recently, the observer was limited to small field of view\n(< 15\'), to low flux rates (\xc2\xab 1 photon/sec/resolution element), and with insufficient telescope\ntime, to small areas of the sky.\nWhile such small fields are reasonable for small, bright, well-defined objects (such as most\nplanetary nebulae), many galactic nebulae are very large (degrees in extent) and their boundaries\nmay not be well defined. A wide field-of-view, narrow passband, fast-focal-ratio telescope is\nneeded to image the ionization structure of such nebulae. Moreover, as most currently available\ninformation of such nebulae came from radio surveys, arcminute angular resolution was considered\nto be very adequate for survey work. Narrow passband photography suddenly became possible when it\nwas realized that a very small aperture, fast focal ratio telescope would be provided for\nsub-arcminute angular resolution even when matched with image-intensifier resolution. The major\nlimitations then became finding the largest optically flat interference filters commercially\n\n185\n\navailable and finding the largest aperture, fastest focal ratio camera lens that fitted behind the\nfilters. (The radiation passed by the filter is indeed well collimated and the incident angle is\nsmall.) The final solution proved to be 125 mm aperture interference filters matched to a Nikon\n300 mm f.l., f/2.8 lens. The intensifier was the 2-stage, magnetically focussed (CIT Direct)\nsystem as supplied by Kitt Peak National Observatory or by Cerro Tololo Inter-American\nObservatory. Photographic plates with IHaJ emulsion were hypersensitized to maximum sensitivity\nby baking in forming gas (2 percent H2\xc2\xbb 98 percent N2). The imaging properties are listed in\nTable I.\n\nTable I.\nProperties of the Wide Field Camera\n7.3 degrees field of view\n15 to 30 arcseconds angular resolution\nGain over photographic plates ~ 50 to 100 at a transfer lens setting of f/2.0\nExposure times: AX = 28A at SOloA to Dsky ~ 0.5 to 0.8 in 20 minutes\n\nThe Wide Field Camera has been used at Kitt Peak or Cerro Tololo since 1976 and over 3000\nplates have been recorded by it. Much of the plate material is published as an Atlas (An Emission\nLine Survey of the Milky Way. NASA SP 434, R. A. R. Parker, T. R. Gull and R. P. Kirshner, 1979).\nWith the camera, three supernova remnants have been identified optically, many interstellar\nbubbles and bowshocks have been noted, and many superbubble structures have been traced throughout\nthe galactic plane. Moreover, the ionization structure of these nebulae has been studied by\npassbands isolating continuum, emission lines of neutrals, and emission lines of singly-, doubly-,\nand triply-ionized elements. The currently available filters are summarized in Table II.\n\nTable II.\nInterference Filters Used by the Wide Field Camera\nxc\n\nAX\n\nBandpass of Interest\n\n4224\n4770\n4860\n5010\n6300\n\n60A\n25A\n28A\n28A\n10A\n\nContinuum\nContinuum\nH6 4816A\n[0 III] 5007A\n[0 I] 6300A\n\n6570\n6736\n\n75A\n50A\n\nHa 6563A and [N III] 6548A and 6584A\n[S II] 6717A and 6731A\n\nAn additional lens (135 mm focal length, F/2.0) has also been used with the filters and\nintensifier.

Indeed the cometary structure was not identified as such until it was noticed\nthat the nebulosity appeared to be moving on successive nights. The plates of interest are\nreproduced in Figure 1.

However, the\n5007A plate shows a very diffuse structure around the head.\nThe source of the diffuse structure is uncertain. Time variability cannot be entirely ruled\nout. However, the structure is several hundred thousands kilometers in size. It is doubtful that\na disturbance could be dissipated in 10^ seconds, the approximate interval between exposures\nthrough the 5000A the 4770A filters. Moreover there is no evidence of solar wind disturbances\nthat would correlate with such a disturbance (M. Niedner, private communication).\nThere are no bright cometary emission features known within the 5010 (/u = 28A) passband.\nComet West did have exceptionally bright, extended C0+ (S. Larson, private communication), and\nthere are two C0+ lines at 5040A and 5068A. However, the filter is a 3-period stack; +\nits\nrejection of both lines should be at least 100 times the peak transmission. Little C0 emission\nshould leak through the side of the filter profile. Comet West may have extended emission thought\nto be molecular in nature at or about 5000A (S. Wyckoff, private communication). Such might be\nthe origin of the extended feature.\nWe point out that the dimension of this structure is ~ 2 x 10^ km. In discussions with Ip\n(1980, Ap_. J. 238, 388) and Combi and Delsemme (1980, Ap. J..238, 38), this is approximately the\ndimension oT the bow shock separation from the nucleus""^- To^ to 10^ km). The detected\nemission indeed may be originating from the volume bounded by the shock interface between the\nsolar wind and evaporated material from the comet nucleus.\nThat shock phenomena might be revealed by narrow passband imagery is not too surprising. The\nmany interstellar bubbles discovered in this survey (T. R. Gull and S. Sophia, 1979, Ap. J. 230,\n782; F. C. Bruhweiler, T. R. Gull, K. G. Henize and R. Cannon, 1981, submitted to Ap.~J.;~~J.~C7\nHeckathorn and T. R. Gull, 1980, BAAS 12, 458; and J. C. Heckatnorn, T. R. Gull ancTF. C.\nBruhweiler, in preparation) are noted primarily by increased [0 III] emission at the shock\ninterface, i.e., emission lines that are sensitive to density changes.\nMore recent studies were attempted on Comet Bradfield this year. NO strong, extended\nnebulosity was noted, but simultaneous spectroscopy by Steve Larson suggested few ions were\npresent. We did, however, develop a valuable addition to the WFC capabilities. The WFC system is\nstrapped upon a 40 cm telescope at KPNO or at CTIO much as a finder telescope is ordinarily\nmounted with the optical axes co-aligned. The spectrograph used by S. Larson (see his\naccompanying paper for description) was mounted at the Cas\'segrain focus of the No. 3 40 cm\ntelescope permitting simultaneous, long-slit spectrophotometry and direct imagery.\nWe now have the capability of monitoring structural changes along with spectral changes. With\nproper choices of cometary passbands, we hope to monitor ions, neutrals and dust by this\napproach. We request advice and suggestions from the community on what filters should be added to\nthose listed in Table II.\nThe currently available filters are now being used on larger telescopes with large-format\nimage intensifiers. Two single-stage fiber-optics-output 144 mm diameter image intensifies are\nbeing used at facilities located on the mountain at Kitt Peak. One intensifier, owned by Steward\nObservatory, is being used by Eric Craine with a 24-inch F/5 bent Cassegrain telescope. He and\ncolleagues have nearly completed a near-infrared survey of the northern hemisphere. The same\n188\n\nintensifier is occasionally used at the F/9 Cassegrain focus of the 90-inch telescope. An\nidentical 144 mm intensifier, on loan from KPNO, is being used with the McGraw-Hill telescope\n(1.3 m, F/7.5) and is also mountable on the KPNO 2.1 meter telescope. Both systems have been\nsuccessfully used with the 125 mm clear aperture interference filters to study supernova remnants\nand interstellar bubbles.\nFinal Remarks\nIn summary, interference filter photography of comets is possible and, coupled with extended\nslit spectroscopy, offers a very useful source of information on studies of various cometary\nconstituents. We should include such in any major program to study Comet Hal ley.\n\n189\n\n'
