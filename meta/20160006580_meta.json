A recent internal NASA study of a High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) led to the development of an evolutionary program for the exploration of Venus, with focus on the mission architecture and vehicle concept for a 30-day crewed mission into Venus's atmosphere at 50 kilometers. Key technical challenges for the mission include performing the aerocapture maneuvers at Venus and Earth, inserting and inflating the airship at Venus during the entry sequence, and protecting the solar panels and structure from the sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Two proofs of concept were identified that would aid in addressing some of the key technical challenges. To mitigate the threat posed by the sulfuric acid ambient in the atmosphere of Venus, a material was needed that could protect the systems while being lightweight and not inhibiting the performance of the solar panels. The first proof of concept identified candidate materials and evaluated them, finding FEP-Teflon (Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene-Teflon) to maintain 90 percent transmittance to relevant spectra even after 30 days of immersion in concentrated sulfuric acid. The second proof of concept developed and verified a packaging algorithm for the airship envelope to inform the entry, descent, and inflation analysis.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160006580, "endDate": "2015-09-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "a0ee286e116f420d96a9b03f7b3db61b", "id": "ddee2c03ddbb43a699c99016ffc74748"}], "name": "AIAA Space and Astronautics Forum and Exposition (AIAA Space 2016)", "location": "Pasadena, CA", "id": "a0ee286e116f420d96a9b03f7b3db61b", "startDate": "2015-08-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160006580, "id": "3c507ce0925e4dedbc873f736349ce98", "publicationDate": "2015-08-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160006580.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160006580/downloads/20160006580.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160006580/downloads/20160006580.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160006580/downloads/20160006580.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
