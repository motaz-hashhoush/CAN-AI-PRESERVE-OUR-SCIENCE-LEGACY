Largely because of the inadequacy of existing analytic techniques. however, oscillatory bursts and their role in cortical processing remains poorly understood. To study oscillatory bursts effectively one must be able to isolate them and characterize them in the single trial. We describe a series of straightforward analysis techniques that produce useful indices of burst characteristics. First, stimulus-evoked responses are estimated using Differentially Variable Component Analysis (dVCA), and are subtracted from the single-trial. The single-trial characteristics of the evoked responses are stored to identify possible correlations with burst activity. Time-frequency (T-F), or wavelet, analyses are then applied to the single trial residuals. While T-F plots have been used in recent studies to identify and isolate bursts, we go further by fitting each burst in the T-F plot with a two-dimensional Gaussian. This provides a set of burst characteristics, such as, center time. burst duration, center frequency. frequency dispersion. and amplitude, all of which contribute to the accurate characterization of the individual burst. The burst phase can also be estimated. Burst characteristics can be quantified with several standard techniques (e.g.. histogramming and clustering), as well as Bayesian techniques (e.g., blocking) to allow a more parametric description analysis of the characteristics of oscillatory bursts, and the relationships of specific parameters to cortical excitability and stimulus integration.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20050082122, "endDate": "2004-10-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society for Neuroscience", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "b41f349a778a41598d44e7250b46c49e", "id": "7dad9ddaea764e27a23c21e3e5146f54"}], "name": "Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting 2004", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "b41f349a778a41598d44e7250b46c49e", "startDate": "2004-10-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050082122, "id": "7544894c0e714724af48efc626ea1628", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
