It traces the history of the recently patented ion- exchange material (IEM) from the accidental discovery that this polymer, a battery separator of marginal performance, picked up copper from distilled water passing through corroded copper tubing in the laboratory, to a point where five organizations and one individual have applied for licenses to manufacture and market it or to use it in a wide variety of applications. This story discusses in detail the problems of converting an immature technology into a mature and eventually commercialized technology, without dedicated resources. Readers will develop an appreciation for how the obstacles to maturation and licensing of the technology were faced and overcome. The lessons learned will be discussed, with the hope of enhancing the technology transfer process.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980233247, "id": "377c8eb61652420eb972474d91747832", "publicationDate": "1998-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980233247.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980233247/downloads/19980233247.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980233247/downloads/19980233247.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980233247/downloads/19980233247.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
