The full set of equations are used, retaining the coupling between the pressure, temperature and velocity fields. This permits modeling He II flow over the full range of conditions, from strongly or weakly driven flow through large pipes, narrow channels and porous media. The system may include most of the components used in modern superfluid flow systems: non-ideal thermomechanical pumps, tapered sections, constrictions, lines with heated side walls and heat exchangers. The model is validated by comparison with published experimental data. It is applied to a complex system to show some of the non-intuitive feedback effects that can occur. This code is ready to be used as a design tool for practical applications of He II. It can also be used for the design of He II experiments and as a tool for comparison of experimental data with the standard two-fluid model.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "32", "submissionId": 19920044653, "issue": "3 19", "issn": "0011-2275", "id": "b304ab2304b24e65b5df550fbc2e2f64", "publicationName": "Cryogenics", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
