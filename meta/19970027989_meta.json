The SeaWiFS bands, however, have nominal spectral bandwidths of 20 and 40 nm. These bandwidths effect the SeaWiFS measurements on orbit. The effects are also linked to the manner in which the instrument was calibrated and to the spectral shape of the radiance that SeaWiFS views. The spectral shape of that radiance will not be well known on orbit. In this technical memorandum, two source spectra are examined. The first is a 12,000 K Planck function, and the second is based on the modeling results of H. Gordon at the University of Miami. By comparing these spectra, the best available corrections to the SeaWiFS measurements for source spectral shape, plus estimates of the uncertainties in these corrections, can be tabulated.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970027989, "id": "2d14ca2ae1a44826b5ca6c449a1cf97b", "publicationDate": "1997-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970027989.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970027989/downloads/19970027989.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970027989/downloads/19970027989.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970027989/downloads/19970027989.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
