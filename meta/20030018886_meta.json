This method is very expensive and requires a lot of fuel, which limits the feasibility of space stations, interplanetary space ships, and probes. Sometimes space probes use the gravity field of a planet However, there am only nine planets in the Solar System, all separated by great distances. There are tons of millions of asteroids in outer space. This paper offers a revolutionary method for changing the trajectory of space probes. The method uses the kinetic or rotary energy of asteroids, comet nuclei, meteorites or other space bodies (small planets, natural planetary satellites, space debris, etc.) to increase (to decrease) ship (probe) speed up to 1000 m/sec (or more) and to achieve any new direction in outer space. The flight possibilities of space ships and probes are increased by a factor of millions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030018886, "endDate": "2002-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "World Space Congress 2002", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "58a2aec2131c40648c06beafdef257f1", "startDate": "2002-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"volume": "56", "submissionId": 20030018886, "id": "f388fc4ae97544b981f3cb5202e753a3", "publicationName": "JBIS", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030018886.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030018886/downloads/20030018886.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030018886/downloads/20030018886.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030018886/downloads/20030018886.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
