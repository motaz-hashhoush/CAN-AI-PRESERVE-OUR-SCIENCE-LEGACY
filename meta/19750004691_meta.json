The system consists of a ground-based encoder and a balloon-borne decoder, both built using low-current drain, high reliability CMOS logic elements. Commands are normally issued by a simple switch closure to +5VDC on the appropriate input line, however as a backup mode, the 8-bit command may be entered manually on 8 toggle switches and executed via a SEND button. In any case, the command is then serialized into a PCM bit stream and sent via a P-Band radio link to the DECODER aloft. All 256 outputs from the DECODER are buffered through drivers and thus may be used to drive CMOS, TTL, or DTL logic.", "title": "Airoscope command system", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T06:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750004691, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Barrows, W."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "8b05c0ba56c14163be6d535cff9f937a"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19750004691, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750004691, "id": "ffb0446ad2d84add8dd314d3c2dfeda2", "publicationName": "Telescope Systems for Balloon-Borne Res.", "publicationDate": "1974-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19750004663, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Telescope Systems for Balloon-Borne Research", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19750004691.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19750004691/downloads/19750004691.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19750004691/downloads/19750004691.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19750004691/downloads/19750004691.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
