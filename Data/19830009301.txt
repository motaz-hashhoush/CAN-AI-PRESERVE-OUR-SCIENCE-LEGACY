The Payload\nAssist Module (PAM-D), which is part of the payload, also performed\nnominally. The synchronous transfer orbital elements achieved by\nDelta/PAM, compared with the nominal expected, are as follows:\nEXPECTED\n\n36,420\nX85\n24.5\n\nApogee\t (km)\t\nPerigee (km)\t\nInclination (degrees)\t\n\nI\n\nMEASURED\n\n36,358\n185\n24.5\n\nThe satellite performed satisfactorily during the transfer orbit, and\nthe ABM was fired successfully at 5:29 p.m., EDT, on August 29, 1982.\nThe satellite was maneuvered to a position 104 degrees West Longitude\nabove the equator.
