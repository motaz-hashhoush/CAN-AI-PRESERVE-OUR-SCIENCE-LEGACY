Each user has its own time slot\nwithin which to transmit voice and data. Continuous Phase Frequency Shift Keying\n(CPFSK) carrier modulation with a burst data rate of 695 kbps and a frequency deviation\nof 486.5 kHz is employed by the system. Reed-Solomon (R-S) coding is also adopted to\nensure data quality.\nIn this paper, the SSCS system requirements, operational scenario, detailed system\narchitecture and parameters, link acquisition strategy, and link performance analysis will\ne presented and discussed.\n\n'
