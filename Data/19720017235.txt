Philpotts, C. C. Schnetzler, David F; Nava,\n*Michael L. Bottino, *Paul D. Fullagar, Herman H. Thomas,\nShuford Schuhmann, and Charles W. Kouns\n\nPlanetology Branch\nGoddard Space Flight Center\nGreenbelt, Maryland 20771\n\n*Presently at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina\n\nAbstract\nChemical analyses have been obtained for five samples of Apollo 14 regolithl\nfines, three 14230 core samples, soil clod 14049, breccias 14305 and 14319, 14310\nbasalt, and some separated phases. The chemical uniformity of these Apollo 14\nsamples indicates thorough mixing and/or uniform source rocks. Basalt 14310 can\nbe matched well in composition by a four to one mixture of soil and plagioclase.\n3 +\nEu2+/Eu\n\nratios calculated for 14310 pigeonite and plagioclase are similar to those\n\nfor Apollo 12 and 15 mare-type basalt phases; this indicates similar redox conditions.\nOur Apollo 14 samples are chemically similar to Apollo 12 and 15 KREEP as\ndistinct from Apollo 11. 12 and 15 and Luna 16 mare-type basalts. A relationship,\nrelating the two types of basalt and in which mare-basalts would represent fused\ncumulates, is suggested.\nINTRODUCTION\nApollo 14 was the first mission to visit an uplands (i. e., non-mare) region\nof the moon. The Fra Mauro Formation, which underlies the landing site, is\nthought to represent throwout produced during an impact that formed the Imbrium\nbasin (LSPET, 1971).\n\nThus the Apollo 14 returned lunar samples were expected to\n\nrepresent material sampled at some depth within the moon and to be older than most\nmare-basalts, at least those at the surface. Subsequent dating of these samples\n(Turner et al., 1971; Papanastassiou and Wasserburg, 1971; Compston et al., 1971)\nbore out this expected age relationship. Preliminary chemical studies of the Apollo\n14 samples, almost all of which are fragmental, revealed affinities to the dark\ncomponent of 12013 breccia and the exotic component in the Apollo 12 soils rather than\n\n1\n\nto the Apollo 11 and 12 mare-basalts (LSPET, 1971).\n\nThe purpose of the present\n\npaper is to report chemical data we have obtained to date on Apollo 14 samples and\nto discuss briefly some of the implications. Data obtained in this laboratory for\ntwo Apollo 14 soils have been discussed previously (Schnetzler and Nava, 1971).\nSamples\nSoils:\n\n14003,32 < 1 mm (901 of total mass), Contingency Fines\n14148,29 < 1 mm (934 of total mass), Surface of Trench Fines,\nStation G.\n14149,45 < 1 mm (72~ of total mass), Bottom of Trench Fines,\nStation G.\n14156, 29 < 1 mm (914 of total mass), Middle of Trench Fines,\nStation G.\n14421,24 < 10 mm, Reserve from unsieved bulk fines.\n\nCore:\n\n14230, 105 Fines 12 cm below top of drive-tube liner, Station G.\n14230,114 Fines 18 cm below top of liner, Station G.\n14230, 123 Fines 22 cm below top of liner, Station G.\n\nSoil Clod:\n\n14049, 32 Extremely friable breccia (coherent soil), 80 m east of\nStation B.\n\nThis sample was separated into 4 sieve\n\nfractions: > 100, < 100, < 200, and < 325 mesh.\nBreccias:\n\n14305,121 fine sawdust, 40 m west of the Comprehensive Sample site.\n14319, 8 Station H.\n\nSample received as chip and subsequently\n\nseparated on the basis of colour and mineralogy. Fraction\nC represents dark breccia clasts and fraction E, light coloured\nbreccia.\n\nCrystalline:\n\n14310, 131 basalt, Station G. Sample received as chips.\n\n430 mg were\n\ntaken for a whole-rock sample. Mineral separates of the\nremainder yielded 370 mg of pyroxene and 200 mg of\nplagioclase.\nPhase separations were carried out utilizing heavy-liquid, electromagnetic\nand hand-picking techniques. Any sieving of samples was through nylon mesh. Any\ngrinding of samples was on boron carbide.\nAnalytical Procedures and Results\nDetermination of most major (> 1V) and minor elements (0. 01 - 1V) in\ncosmochemical materials by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) using\nsamples as small as 0. 05 g has been demonstrated (Nava, 1970; Maxwell et al., 1970;\nNava et al., 1971; and Schnetzler and Nava, 1971) to yield analytical results having\nprecisions and accuracies equal to, or better, than those obtained with classical\nchemical methods, owing to the main atomic absorption features of high analytical\nsensitivity and relative freedom from chemical interferences. Due to the limited\nquantities available, a combined semi-micro analytical scheme of atomic absorption\nand colorimetric spectrophotometry was devised to provide accurate bulk chemical\nanalysis for all of the major (Si, Ti, Al, Mg, Ca, Fe) and most of the minor (Na,\nK, Mn, P, Cr) constituents of these Apollo 14 samples.\nPrior to undertaking the elemental analyses, each Apollo 14 sample was\noptically examined to check for obvious contaminants from grinding, sawing, and/or\npackaging (plastic or aluminum vial particles).\n\nAll samples appeared to be\n\nacceptable and aliquants of approximately 50 mg (duplicates when available, as listed\n\n3\n\nin Table 1) were weighed on a precision microbalance and prepared without further\ngrinding (either as received from MSC or as yielded by the mineral and grain size\nfraction separations in our laboratory) by the teflon decomposition, HF - H3BO 3\nmatrix procedure described by Bernas (1968). All samples were quantitatively\ndiluted to a volume of 100 ml, which included 0. 5 ml aqua regia, 3 ml HF, and\n2.8 g H3BO .3\n\nThe AAS analysis method (Bernas, 1968) was modified, however, in\n\nthe following ways in order to maximize accuracy. Close bracketing sets of\nsynthetically prepared (from Matthey Specpure and Spex Industries spectrographic\ngrade metals and reagent compounds and J. T. Baker acids) composite analytical\nstandards, containing the equivalent fluoborate acid matrix concentration, were\nused for calibration of the double beam atomic absorption and colorimetric spectrophotometers. All of the AAS determinations were made on the original sample\nsolution volume, without further dilution, by means of appropriate selection of\nburner heads and rotations. Samples were analyzed in small-numbered sets, each\nwith their own set of composite analytical standards, in order. to minimize instrumental variables such as drift. The solution matrix of fluoborate, in addition to\nproviding a common interference suppressant matrix for AAS determination of Si,\nAl and Ca (acetylene-nitrous oxide flame) and of Fe (total), Mg, Na, K, Mn, and\nCr (acetylene - air flame), served as a complexing agent to eliminate iron interference in colorimetric determinations of Ti by H2 02 . Another aliquot of the AAS\nsolution was taken for colorimetric P via molybdivanado - phosphoric acid complex.\nDue to limited sample availability and anticipated low concentrations in these lunar\nmaterials, H20 and H 0\n2\n2\n\nwere not determined.\n\n4\n\nSamnple analysis sets consisted of: a) 14003, 14148, 14149, 14156, 14421,\nand 14310 whole rock; b) 14305, 14049 sized fractions, 14230 cores, and 14319 light\nand dark fractions; c) 14310 feldspar; and d) 14310 pyroxene. Reagent blanks were\nmonitored during all analyses. Accuracy of this combined semi-micro analytical\nscheme was monitored by simultaneous analyses of U. S. Geological Survey reference\nsilicates V- 1, BCR-1, and AGV-1, and can be assessed from the results listed in\nTable 1, along with recent recommended literature values for comparison. Relative\ntotal precision (decomposition, volumetric, plus instrumental) of this method for\nthe Apollo 14 duplicates and USGS reference replicates was + 14,, or better, for\nmost elements.\nSample 14305, a breccia sawdust, which by optical observation appeared to\nbe clean, was analyzed for copper by AAS (and found to be <0. 01a) because some\nsawdust samples were known to include segments from a copper-wire saw (Rose,\npersonal communication, 1972).\nThe trace-element results given in Table 2 were obtained by mass-spectrometric stable-isotope dilution. Chemical procedures utilized for the soil samples\nwere those used previously in our Apollo 11 and 12 work (Philpotts and Schnetzler,\n1970; Schnetzler and Philpotts, 1971).\n\n14310 and its separates underwent the\n\nslightly modified chemistry utilized in the analysis of Luna 16 soils. and 14305 that\nwere used for the Luna 16 rock chips (Philpotts et al., 1972).\nalong with the Apollo 14 samples have not yet been analyzed.\n\nBlanks prepared\nHowever, blank values\n\nobtained using each of the chemical techniques indicate generally negligible corrections;\nthe largest corrections (using the previously determined blank values) were for\n\n5\n\nZr (,\n\n2V), Lu (- 1. 41), and K (. 1%) values for the plagioclase separated from\n\n14310. All the values reported in Table 2 are for single determinations. Precision\nand accuracy of previous analyses (Philpotts et al., 1972) of standard rock monitors\nindicate that all the Apollo 14 data are probably good to within less than \xc2\xb1 3% relative.\nHomogeneity of Apollo 14 Samples\nIt is apparent from the data in Tables 1 and 2 and those for 14163 and 14259\n(Schnetzler and Nava, 1971), that the Apollo 14 soil samples analyzed in this laboratory\nare quite homogeneous in chemical composition. For these surficial fines, trench\nand core samples, and the soil clod, the largest ranges in element concentrations,\nexpressed in terms of the percent deviations from the mean of the extreme values,\nwere: Na 12; P 11; K 9; Ti, Mn, Cr 8; Zr 7; Al, Li 6; Mg, Rb 5 and Fe 4. Ranges\nfor other elements were smaller and close to the expected precisions of the analytical\ntechniques. The apparent ranges for Mn and Cr may be analytical, in part, because\nof the low concentrations. The variations of Na and K are thought to be largely real.\nNa and K tend to vary sympathetically. The fact that Zr also appears to be positively\ncorrelated with Na and K (as does Li) suggests that selective volatility is not the\ncause of these variations. Ti shows some positive correlation with Na and K but\nthere appear to be other factors (ilmenite?) influencing its concentration. P variations\nappear to be relatively random and may reflect somewhat heterogeneous distribution\nof phosphates. Al is low in the soil clod samples 14049, two of which have relatively\nhigh Mg and Fe; this might reflect a somewhat lower plagioclase/mafics ratio for\nthese samples. The sympathetic variations in alkalis and Zr most probably reflect\nsomewhat heterogeneous distribution of a phase rich in these elements, possibly\n\n6\n\nresembling the mesostasis material of lunar basalts. Our data do not indicate any\ndefinite general variations in soil composition correlated either with grain size or\nwith collection depth. Na and K (and correlated elements) are lowest in 14259\n(Schnetzler and Nava, 1971), and highest in 14149 and 14049 (100-200 mesh fraction).\n14259 is the finest grained and 14149 the coarsest grained of the soil samples (LSPET,\n1971) and this suggests a possible correlation of alkalis with grain size. However,\n14421 a coarser grained sample from the same site as 14259 is also low in K. The\ndata indicate a possible geographic variation in alkalis, inasmuch as 14259 was\ncollected farthest away from Cone Crater, and except for 14049, 14149 was the\nclosest. However, with the limited number of samples, and lacking material from\nthe ridge Fra Mauro Formation and Cone Crater throwout, firm conclusions are\nnot possible at this time.\nAlthough there is some heterogeneity as discussed above, the most interesting\nconclusion resulting from inter-comparison of Apollo 14 soil samples is that they\nare, in fact, remarkably homogeneous. This uniformity is brought out in Figure 1\nfor the trace elements; concentrations have been normalized to the chondritic values\ngiven in the last column of Table 2. The situation is in marked contrast to that\nholding for the Apollo 12 soils (eg. Schnetzler and Philpotts, 1971).\n\nThe homogeneity\n\nof Apollo 14 soils indicates thorough mixing of the regolith at this site, and /or\nrelatively homogeneous source rocks with chemical composition very similar to that\nof the soils.\n14305 breccia sawdust is similar in many respects in chemical composition\nto the soils (Table 1). However, Al203 is distinctly lower and MgO distinctly higher\n\n7\n\nin the breccia. Also most of the trace elements are enriched in the breccia although\ntheir relative concentrations are not much affected (Table 2; Fig. 1).\n\nThese differences\n\nrelative to the soil could be accounted for in terms of a deficiency of feldspar and\nthe presence of an accessory phase(s) rich in trace elements. For breccia 14319\nwe have at present only the major element analyses of light and dark portions reported\nin Table 1. In terms of Al20 3 and MgO, 14319 is intermediate between 14305 breccia\nand the soils. The high P 2 0 5 , Na20 and K20 of the 14319 materials indicate that\nother trace elements might also be relatively enriched. The light and dark portions\nof 14319 show some chemical differences, particularly for SiO 2 and TiO2; it appears\nlikely, however, that the bulk concentrations of these oxides in 14319 might be close\nto those for 14305 breccia. The variations in composition within and between these\nbreccias tempt the speculation that the average chemical composition of the Fra\nMauro breccias might be very similar to the soil composition (except for solar wind\ncomponents, etc. ).\n14310 Basalt\n14310 is the only Apollo 14 basalt that we have studied. It is apparent from\nTables 1 and 2 and Figure 1 that 14310 is similar in chemical composition to the\nApollo 14 soils. However, the composition of 14310 is not within our soil range.\nWhereas the major element data for the breccias indicate an excess of mafic phases\nrelative to the soil, the 14310 data indicate an excess of plagioclase. Caution is\nwarranted, of course, in comparing 4 b. y. old rocks (Turner et al., 1971;\nPapanastassiou and Wasserburg, 1971; Compston et al., 1971) with soil samples\nthat were evolving up to the time of their collection. Nevertheless, the fact that the\n\n8\n\n14310 and breccia compositions bracket those of the soils suggests that any addition\nof foreign components to the soils may not have greatly affected the concentrations\nof the elements we have determined. The 14310 composition is matched remarkably\nwell by a mixture of soil and feldspar; the data appear to preclude addition or subtraction of significant amounts of other components. These points are well illustrated\nin Figure 2 in which the compositions of the soil average. 14310 separated plagioclase\n(Tables 1 and 2), and a 4:1 soil-feldspar mixture are plotted, all data being normalized\nto the composition of 14310 whole-rock. As can be seen, the concentrations in the\nmixture are within + 10,\' of those in 14310 for almost all of the 25 elements.\nmajor discrepancy is for Eu which is 25-\n\nhigher in the mixture than in 14310.\n\nThe\nThe\n\nagreement among the soil Eu values indicates that this discrepancy is not due to error\nin the average soil value.\n\nIt is possible, however, that the soils contain. as a\n\nforeign component, plagioclase (anorthosite?) with a very large positive Eu anomaly.\nIf this is the explanation of the discrepancy then the amount of feldspar needed in a\nmixture with uncontaminated soil to match the 14310 composition would be greater than\nthe indicated 204.\n\nAnalytical error is possible in the determination of the 14310\n\nwhole-rock and plagioclase Eu concentrations but we see no reason at the present time\nto doubt these values. Helmke and Haskin (1972) report a 14310 whole-rock Eu concentration of 2. 08 ppm and Hubbard et al. (1972) one of 2. 15 ppm, in good agreement\nwith our value of 2. 09 ppm. The Eu discrepancy would be reduced if feldspar with\nless Eu than 14310 plagioclase were used in the mixture. A lower feldspar Eu concentration could be explained by one or both of two possibilities, Feldspar from a\nmore rapidly cooled chemical equivalent of 14310 would be expected to have a smaller\n\n9\n\nEu anomaly because of kinetics, inherent contamination, etc. However, if this were\nthe explanation Sr would be expected to show a discrepancy similar to that for Eu,\nand it does not. The second possibility entails having in the mixture a feldspar with\nlower Eu/Sr than 14310 plagioclase. Eu/Sr in lunar basalts and constituent feldspars\ntends to increase with increasing overall trace element concentration which presumably\nreflects extent of differentiation. The lowest Eu/Sr yet reported for a lunar plagioclase is for 15415 anorthosite (Hubbard et al., 1971); use of this material in the 20O\nplagioclase-soil mixture would result in a Eu excess of only 74.\nThe second largest discrepancy in modeling 14310 in terms of a soil-feldspar\nmixture is for Zr. This discrepancy is probably not due to analytical error; the soil\ndata are internally consistent, and 14310 whole-rock has a reasonably Zr/Hf ratio.\nIt could well be due to the presence in the 14310 sample analyzed of an excess of an\naccessory phase rich in Zr. A deficiency in 14310 of ilmenite etc. could similarly\nexplain the Ti discrepancy.\nAlthough there are some discrepancies, the overall compositional match of\n14310 whole-rock and the 4:1 soil-plagioclase mixture is good. It seems entirely\npossible that the soils come close to representing the average composition of Apollo\n14 rocks, at least for the elements we have studied, and that 14310 deviates from this\ntypical composition in containing an excess of plagioclase. If 14310 represents a fused\nsoil or breccia as has been suggested on the basis of its "meteoritic" component\n(Morgan et al., 1972) then the feldspar excess indicates local heterogeneity in\nsurficial fragmental material at that time. If 14310 represents an igneous rock then\nboth the excess feldspar and the "meteoritic" component may have been added by\n\n10\n\nassimilation and/or by mechanical incorporation of xenolithic material in accord with\nthe suggestion of Ridley et al. (1972).\nAnalytical data for feldspar (An8 4 ) and pyroxene (pigeonite) separated from\n14310 are given in Tables 1 and 2. The phases were separated utilizing heavy liquid,\nelectromagnetic, and hand-picking techniques; microscopic examination indicated that\nthe feldspar separate was about 99K pure whereas the pyroxene separate contained\nabout 10\xe2\x80\xa2 contaminants. Except for Li, Sr and Eu, which are largely accounted for,\nthe whole-rock, plagioclase, and pyroxene data indicate that about half of\nthe whole-rock trace-element content is concentrated in accessory phases; this is in\naccord with previous observations (Philpotts and Schnetzler, 1970; Schnetzler and\nPhilpotts, 1971; Schnetzler et al., 1972).\n3\nThe Eu2+/Eu\n\n+\n\nvalues reported for 14310\'feldspar and pyroxene in Table 2\n\nwere calculated according to the method of Philpotts (1970).\n\nEu\n\n/Eu\n\nratios\n\ncalculated using the whole-rock data are within 204 of these mineral-mineral values.\nThe plagioclase ratio is very similar to those calculated for plagioclases from two\nApollo 11 basalts (Philpotts, 1970) and lower than those for 12035, 12040 (Schnetzler.\nand Philpotts, 1971), and 15555 (Schnetzler et al., 1972) plagioclases. The pyroxene\nEu\n\n/Eu\n\nratio is higher than any previously determined for this mineral in lunar\n\nsamples. The difference between the 14310 pyroxene and feldspar ratios is smaller\nthan any previously determined for lunar samples with the exception of that for 12021\nwhich shows a similar spread.\n\nThe spread in pyroxene-feldspar ratios tends to be\n\nsmaller in finer grained rocks and may be due to kinetics, inherent contamination of\nphases, or other factors. Taking this effect into account and assuming (a) equilibrium\n\n11\n\nin all cases, (b) the validity of the calculation, and (c) that Eu\n\n/Eu\n\nreflects redox\n\nconditions, then it appears that 14310 crystallized under conditions slightly more\nreducing than those holding for the Apollo 11 basalts and perhaps similar to those\nholding for 12035, 12040 and 15555.\n\nThese relationships appear to be in accord with\n\npetrographic observations (Ridley et al., 1972).\nPetrogenesis\nThe Apollo 14 materials appear to be identical in composition to the exotic\nfragments in the Apollo 12 regolith that were termed KREEP (Hubbard and Gast, 1971).\nKREEP-type material also appears to be abundant in the Apollo 15 soils judging from\ntheir chemistry (LSPET, 1972; Schnetzler et al., 1972; our unpublished data). In\ncontrast, the compositions of the soils from Apollo 11 (Philpotts and Schnetzler, 1970)\nand Luna 16 (Philpotts et al., 1972) indicate very little KREEP component. These\nbulk chemistry conclusions are in accord with the studies by Reid et al. (1972) of\nregolith glasses. The abundance of KREEP at the Apollo 12, 14 and 15 sites and its\npaucity at the Apollo 11 and Luna 16 sites, suggest that this material may be related\nto the Imbrium basin or its throwout. The Apollo 15 y-ray experiment is of interest\nin this respect in that it indicated high Th, U, and K concentrations (as in KREEP) in\nMare Imbrium and Oceanus Procellarum and a smooth decrease in concentration away\nfrom these regions (Metzger et al., 1972). It appears, therefore, that Apollo 14\ntype material may have a restricted geographical distribution.\n\n12\n\nApollo 14 material shares with the mare basalts certain lunar characteristics such as low volatile content. However, relative to the mare basalts, Apollo 14\nmaterial has higher concentrations of large-ion lithophile trace elements and Al.\nhigher Mg/Fe, and lower Fe. Some of the difficulties encountered in attempting to\nrelate these two types of material have been touched upon by Hubbard and Gast\n(1971).\n\nIt appears most unlikely that they are directly related to each other in terms\n\nof various degrees of partial fusion or fractional crystallization of the same source\nmaterial. If they were so related it is difficult to explain\'the equivalent concentrations of Mg considering the distinctly different Al, Fe, and trace-element concentrations, for example. It appears that different source materials are required. There\nappears to be general agreement among experimental petrologists that Apollo 14\nmaterial probably resulted from partial fusion of an olivine-plagioclase-pyroxene\nassemblage (Biggar et al. ,1972a; Ford et al.. 1972; Kushiro, 1972; Ringwood et al.,\n\n1972; Walker et al., 1972).\n\nThe miare-basalts are of less certain origin (Biggar et al.,\n\n1972b).\n\nIt has been suggested that the different source materials of the Fra Mauro and\nthe mare basalts reflect primary accretion layering of the moon, with the more refractory source of the (older) Fra Mauro basalts being at shallower depths than the source\nof the mare basalts (Hubbard and Gast, 1971; Gast and McConnell, 1972; Ringwood\net al., 1972).\n\nOne possible problem with this hypothesis is that it requires material\n\nbeing added during the later stages of accretion to be more refractory than the earlier\nmaterials, whereas if any heterogeneity in accretion is expected at all. it might generally\nbe expected in the reverse direction. Further, ratios of volatile to involatile elements\nfor both the high alumina and the mare basalts do not appear to support this hypothesis.\n\n13\n\nK and Ba may be the best pair to consider in that they show good geochemical coherence\nin igneous processes (hence K/Ba for a basalt is expected to be quite similar to K/Ba\nof its source rock) but have quite different volatilities. K/Ba ratios of 8. 4 and 4. 5\nfor trace element enriched and depleted Apollo 11 mare-type basalts, respectively\n(Philpotts and Schnetzler, 1970), bracket the ratios for all other bulk lunar samples\nthat we have analyzed. The Apollo 14 samples have K/Ba ratios from 4.9 to 6.4\n(Table 2); 12013 samples have ratios from 4. 6 to 6. 6 (Schnetzler et al., 1970). Ratios\nfor Apollo 11 enriched-type, normal Apollo 12 (Schnetzler and Philpotts, 1971), and\nApollo 15555 (Schnetzler et al., 1972) mare-type basalts are higher than those for the\nKREEP-type materials. But ratios for Apollo 11 depleted-type, Apollo 12038, and\nLuna 16 (Philpotts et al., 1972) mare-type basalts are at or below the lower values of\nthe KREEP-type material. Thus no good case can be made for K/Ba being distinctly\ndifferent in the source materials of the two basalt types. On the contrary, the evidence\ntends to indicate that K/Ba may have been identical, initially, in both source materials.\nThis appears to be difficult to reconcile with a simple model of volatility dependent,\nheterogeneous accretion. Any simple volatility related process sufficient to effect\nsizable increases in the concentrations of refractory elements such as Al might be\nexpected to effect very extensive depletion of volatile elements such as K. It is\npossible, of course, that all of the accreting material was depleted in volatile elements\nto the extent that they were at essentially equilibrium values prohibiting further loss.\nHowever, before giving exhaustive consideration to such possibilities, homogeneous\naccretions models merit appraisal.\nO\'Hara and colleagues (Biggar et al., 1972a; Ford et al., 1972) have suggested that Apollo 14 type aluminous liquids might be produced by partial melting in\n14\n\nsystems rich in alkalis and/or water, and that these volatiles have subsequently been\nlost. The mare-type basalts might then be produced by partial melting of the\nvolatile and feldspar depleted residue. However, as far as alkali loss is concerned\nthere is first the problem of the mechanism whereby significant loss could be\neffected and secondly the fact that the K/Ba (etc.) data and the Rb-Sr data show no\nevidence that any significant alkali loss has taken place. Similarly, the available\ndata on aluminous lunar rocks show no evidence (such as hydrous phases, deuteric\nalteration, etc.) of significant concentrations of water in their evolution. At the\npresent time these ideas, therefore, appear to be interesting but unsupported\nspeculations.\nAn apparently more attractive homogeneous accretion model is one in which\nApollo 14 and other aluminous lunar materials represent primary aluminous liquid\nand plagioclase rich cumulates in various proportions formed in an igneous event\ntaking place during the first few hundred million years of lunar evolution, whereas\nmare-type basalts result from later fusion of mafic-rich cumulates formed during\nthe initial event(s). This model seems to fit adequately the chemical and geochronologic\nconstraints. Detailed thermal calculations for this model have not yet been made but\nit appears that modifications of Hays\' (1972) third model would suffice.\nAcknowledgements\nWe express our most profound gratitude to our respective families, present\nand future, for their patience during the course of this work.
