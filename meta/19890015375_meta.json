This arrangement is designed to simulate the on-orbit effects of contamination and degradation of optical surfaces. This simulation is accomplished through the use of non-coherent VUV sources illuminating optical surfaces located in a high vacuum chamber. Several sources of contamination are employed. The reflectivity is measured both at the specular reflection as well as at two scattered positions, forward and reverse. The system components are described and an operating procedure is given.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890015375, "id": "f35532b674a8481b8a38bdaa31804810", "publicationDate": "1988-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890015375.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890015375/downloads/19890015375.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890015375/downloads/19890015375.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890015375/downloads/19890015375.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
