Both forms of energy can be utilized if such cells are deployed in close proximity to the consumer (rooftop). CdS/Cu2S solar cells are an example of cells which may be produced inexpensively enough to become economically attractive. Cell parameters relevant for combined solar conversion are presented. Critical issues, such as production yield, life expectancy, stability of performance, are discussed. Systems design parameters related to operating temperatures are analyzed. First results obtained on Solar One,  the experimental solar house of the University of Delaware, are given. Economic aspects are discussed.", "title": "Solar house system interfaced with the power utility grid", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T11:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19760028733, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Boeer, K.
