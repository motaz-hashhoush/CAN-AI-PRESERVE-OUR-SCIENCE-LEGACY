Rom and Charles C. Masser\n\nLewis Research Center\nS UMh4ARY\nLarge subsonic aircraft, greater than 905 metric tons (1000 tons) gross weight,\nhave the potential for hauling transoceanic cargo at rates in the range of $0.006 to\n$0.036 per metric ton-kilometer ($0.01 to $0. O6/ton-n mi) at speeds of 740 to 925\nkilometers per hour (400 to 500 knots). It theoretically wouldtake a fleet of 500 such aircraft to handle 1 percent of the forecast world ocean trade in 1980. For gross weights\nof 3620 metric tons (4000 tons) the cargo rate would be reduced to less than $0.012 per\nmetric ton-kilometer ($O.O2/ton-n mi). It theoretically would take a fleet of over 1000\nsuch aircraft to carry 8 percent of the world transoceanic trade projected f o r 1980 o r\n4 percent of the projected trade in 1995. Aircraft with a gross weight of 3620 metric\ntons (4000 tons) using compact lightweight nuclear reactors show better performance\nthan chemical aircraft for ranges greater than 5565 kilometers (3000 n mi). Nuclear\naircraft performance is less sensitive than that of chemical aircraft to the operating and\ncost assumptions used. Relatively large variations in any of the important assumptions\nhave a relatively small effect on nuclear aircraft performance.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe world is currently experiencing a major expansion in transoceanic trade. The\nDepartment of Transportation predicts that world ocean trade will almost double by\n1980 (ref. 1); see figure 1. In 1980, world ocean trade is forecast to be about 4 billion\nmetric tons. This represents about 12 trillion metric ton-kilometers (20 trillion tonn mi) of ocean commerce per year.\nIn 1968, about 11. 5 percent of all U. S. foreign trade was liner tonnage that had an\naverage value of $0.626 per kilogram or $0.284 per pound (ref. 2). Assume that 10 to\n15 percent of the cargo value i s a reasonable cost for its transportation and that 7420 to\n11 130 kilometers (4000 to 6000 n mi) i s an average transoceanic range. This yields an\nallowable charge of $0.006 to $0.012 per metric ton-kilometer ($0.01 to $0.02/ton-n mi)\n\n8-\n\n.V\n\nc\nL\n\nE\n\nc\n0\n\n6-\n\n4-\n\n77\nL\n\nE\n1950\n\n1960\n\n1970\n\n1980\nYear\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\nFigure 1. - Department of transportation w o r l d oceanborne\ntrade forecast.\n\nfor cargo whose value is $0. 55 to $0.66 per kilogram ($0. 25 to $0. 30/lbm). In other\nwords, there may be more than 1.2 trillion metric ton-kilometers (2 trillion ton-n mi)\nof cargo traffic suitable for hauling at $0.006 to $0.012 per metric ton-kilometer ($0.01\nto $0.02/ton-n mi) in 1980. This cost for transoceanic commerce is comparable to\nrailroad cost for overland movement of cargo.\nIf aircraft could be developed to c a r r y cargo at this cost at a speed of 740 to\n925 kilometers per hour (400 to 500 knots), it theoretically would take a fleet of more\nthan 2000 such aircraft with cargo capacity of 1360 metric tons (1500 tons) each to handle the 1980 traffic at a utilization rate of 0.6. These figures do not take into account\nthe additional traffic that would be attracted by the large reduction in transit time r e sulting from the 740- to 925-kilometer-per-hour (400-to 500-knot) speed. There is,\ntherefore, clearly an incentive to determine whether aircraft can be developed to c a r r y\ncargo at a rate of $0.006 to $0.012 per metric ton-kilometer ($0.01 to $0.02/ton-n mi).\nNASA has been conducting a low-level study to determine the feasibility of large\nnuclear-powered-air-cushionvehicles and aircraft (refs. 3 and 4 . The objectives of\n)\nthe study a r e (1) to determine the feasibility of practical, safe, and economical nuclear\npowerplants for air-cushion vehicles and aircraft; (2) to define the key problems requiring research and development; and (3) to demonstrate or develop key technology that\nis required for feasibility assessment.\nThis report presents the results of a simplified preliminary study to determine the\npotential of large subsonic aircraft for achieving cargo rates of $0.006 to $0.012 per\nmetric ton-kilometer ($0.01 to $0.02/ton-n mi). Both chemical and nuclear power are\nconsidered. The nuclear-powered aircraft use the propulsion technology that is de-\n\n2\n\nscribed in reference 5. Chemical aircraft use gas turbine technology forecast for 1980.\nAssumptions must be made for a large number of performance and cost variables.\nThe results must be carefully considered in light of these assumptions. To evaluate the\nsensitivity of the results to the assumptions, each major assumption is independently\nvaried and the effect on operating cost presented.\n\nVEHICLE DESC RI PTION\nThe aircraft considered in this study are characterized by their lift-drag ratios and\nweight breakdowns. The propulsion system studied is the turbofan system. The-energy\nsources considered are chemical (jet fuel) and nuclear.\n\nVehicle Characteristics\nThe fact that 320- to 360-metric ton (350- to 400-ton) aircraft are now in operation\nis used as a basis for extrapolation to the large subsonic aircraft studied in this report.\nThe Lockheed C-5A (fig. 2) is now in active military service for hauling large equipment and cargo. The Boeing 747 (fig. 3) is in commercial passenger service. Aircraft\nof much larger size (two to three times the gross weight of the 747 and C-5A) are now\non the drawing boards of the major aircraft companies. One company has even made a\npreliminary conceptual study of an aircraft 15 times the g r o s s weight of the 747 and\nC-5A (ref. 6). A three-view drawing of this aircraft is shown in figure 4. It has a wing\nspan of over 335 meters (1100 ft) and can c a r r y a cargo of about 40 percent of its gross\nweight. It is powered by turbofan engines that utilize heat energy from a nuclear reactor. In addition, chemical lift engines can be installed in the wings and near the fuselage nose to provide a V/STOL capability. Although a wheeled landing gear is shown in\nthe drawing, an air-cushion landing gear would probably be lighter and provide better\noperational flexibility. The aircraft could then land on and take off from land o r water.\nLand surfaces could be relatively unprepared surfaces, such as sod o r earth, if aircushion landing gear is used. The structure weight fraction of this large aircraft is in\nthe same range as all other transport aircraft (about 25 to 30 percent of the gross\nweight). This low structure weight fraction for such a large aircraft has been achieved\n(even though conventional aircraft materials a r e used) by more efficient utilization of\nstructure materials made possible by the large dimensions of the aircraft.\n1\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. - Lockheed C-5A aircraft.

Greatly simplified performance data\na r e used in t h i s study to facilitate parametric analysis.\nIn the case of nuclear power, it was assumed that the reactor was of the highpressure helium type shown in figure 5. The helium is heated as it flows between the\nhot reactor fuel elements. The hot helium is then ducted to a heat exchanger that is\nlocated between the compressor and combustor of a turbofan engine. The air flowing\nfrom the compressor is heated by the heat exchanger before it enters the combustor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98 U02 pebble bed\nL\n\n/ /\xe2\x80\x99\n\nImpact energy absorbing\nand gamma and n e u t r o n s h i e l d\n\nt\n\\\n\n+\n\nc\n\nFan\n\nC D-10961-22\nNuclear a i r c r a f t powerplant\nFigure 5.\n\n- Schematic drawing of a compact helium-cooled\n\nreactor for aircraft applications.\n\n5\n\nThe engine can, therefore, operate on either nuclear or chemical power. Shielding and\na containment vessel a r e shown surrounding the reactor. The shielding is complete\n(unit or 47 shielding) s o that dose levels a r e the same in all directions from the reactor\n2\nshield. The design dose levels used a r e such that a dose level of 0 . 2 5 millirem per\nhour at 9 . 1 5 meters (30 ft) from the reactor centerline is less than the dose due to cosmic radiation at 10. 7 kilometers (35 000 ft) altitude (about 0. 35 millirem/hr). Beyond\n9 . 1 5 meters (30 ft) from the reactor centerline the dose decreases approximately as\nthe square of the distance. At 30. 5 meters (100 ft), for example, the dose rate is\n0 . 0 2 5 millirem per hour. In actual practice the dose levels will be even less than the\nvalues used here because other materials such as structure, cargo, and equipment, that\nmay be located between the shield and the dose-measuring point, provide shielding but\nare not included in the calculation.\nAn important feature of the reactor design is that a containment vessel is provided.\nThe containment vessel is designed to prevent the escape of fission products in the worst\naircraft impact accident and also in the event of a reactor meltdown that follows a major\naccident. Descriptions and results of experiments on the principles used to achieve fission product containment a r e discussed in references 3 and 7 to 10. A brief description\nof the principles involved is included here because this represents a departure from\ncommonly used concepts of fission product containment.\nThe particular system shown in figure 5 w a s specifically designed for subsonic aircraft where impact speeds could be as high as 305 meters (1000 ft) per second. The\ncontainment vessel and reactor vessel a r e designed to prevent rupture at high impact\nspeeds. This is accomplished by several design features. First of all, the containment\nand reactor vessels are fabricated of a ductile high-strength material such as stainless or\nmaraging steel. High-strength, very ductile materials are desirable so that the kinetic\nenergy of impact is absorbed by plastic deformation without rupture. Secondly, the\nouter and inner shields a r e fabricated of shield materials such as honeycomb structure\nor small spheres that absorb energy by their deformation during impact. The neutron\nshield external to the containment vessel is fabricated of a material like plastic honeycomb. The gamma shielding required in addition to the shielding provided by the reactor and containment vessels is fabricated of small deformable pieces of depleted uranium\nmetal. The small pieces a r e designed to provide the proper volume fraction required\nf o r minimum shield weight and also to provide energy absorption capability when they\nare deformed during impact. The void remaining when the shielding space is filled with\nthe uranium metal pieces is filled with water for neutron shielding. The water may also\nserve as an aid for absorbing kinetic energy. The high water pressures that would be\ngenerated during impact could serve to expand or stretch the containment vessel so that\na greater portion of the vessel is used to absorb energy. The basic feature of the reactor system design is that it utilizes as much of the system materials as possible to\nserve multiple functions. For example, the containment vessel and reactor vessel serve\n6\n\nas shield, structure, and energy absorber besides providing the basic containment\nfunctions.\nTo provide for retention of fission products during a reactor meltdown, two situations must be considered: meltdown without impact and meltdown after impact. To\nprovide for the case of meltdown without impact (such as a loss-of-coolant accident), a\nlayer of U 0 2 pebbles is located just inside the reactor vessel. The U 0 2 bed is a refractory insulating layer that will reduce the heat flow through the containment vessel. This\ncauses the reactor materials and fission products to reach high temperatures without\nmelting through to the reactor vessel. Because the reactor materials (including the\nwide variety of fission product compounds that are generating heat by their decay) are\nforced to high temperatures by the insulating effect of the U 0 2 pebbles, vapors are\nformed. These vapors will diffuse or flow into the UOz pebble bed. As the vapors flow\ndown the temperature gradient in the pebble bed, they will condense at the appropriate\ncondensation temperature for each vapor. The net effect is that the heat-generating fission products will tend to condense in relatively uniform concentric layers at each appropriate condensing temperature. This results in a relatively uniform heat flux leaving the\nreactor vessel. The reactor vessel is immersed in shield water which serves to cool\nthe vessel. The heat causes steam to form which is released to the atmosphere when\nthe desired shield water pressure has been achieved.\nIn the case of reactor meltdown after impact, the shield water may o r may not remain in the system. If it does, meltdown is handled as just described. For the event\nwhere no water is present in the shield, another layer of U 0 2 pebbles is provided on\nthe inside surface of the containment vessel. When the reactor melts down, the vapors\nthat a r e formed flow out into the U 0 2 layer and a r e condensed in concentric shells just\nas discussed previously. The insulating U 0 2 provides the means for achieving as uniform a heat flux as possible around the entire containment vessel. The only means of\ncooling the containment vessel now, however, is thermal radiation and free convection\nto the air. This requirement determines the minimum containment vessel size. For a\n600-megawatt reactor this corresponds to a diameter of about 6 . 1 meters (20 ft) if the\n10\'\ncontainment vessel is not to exceed 1030 K ( 4 0 F).\nExperimental and analytical studies are underway to determine the feasibility of\nthe principles outlined here. The results to date a r e given in references 4 and 8 to 10.\nInasmuch as the application studied herein is for transoceanic commerce, nuclear\nsafety problems a r e eased. As indicated in references 3, 5, and 7, the design of postimpact reactor meltdown protection systems is much simpler in this case because the\ncontainment vessel would be submerged in water following an accident. The containment\nvessel diameter need b e only about one-half the diameter of the air-cooled case. In\naddition, even if containment vessel rupture occurs, only the least radioactive materials,\nthe noble (inert) fission product gases, w i l l escape because the other fission products\nare dissolved o r trapped in the water.\n7\n\nANA LYS I S\nThe analysis h a s two main subdivisions. The first deals with performance estimation in terms of weight, speed, power, and payload. The second deals with a simplified\ncost analysis used to estimate the operating cost as a function of the operating variables.\nThe analysis presents only the equations and relations used. The specific values of the\nvariables used are presented in the following section, ASSUMPTIONS.

The dose rate is 0.25 millirem per hour at 9.15 meters (30 ft)\n)\nfrom the reactor centerline. The dose rate decreases approximately as the inverse of\nthe square of the distance from the reactor. At 30. 5 meters (100 ft), for example, the\ndose r a t e is about 0.025 millirem per hour. The shield is composed of optimumthickness spherical layers of depleted uranium, mixtures of depleted uranium and water,\nand water. The reactor is assumed to be a sphere whose size is determined by reactor\npower density and reactor power. The calculated data points have been generalized and\nare expressed by the following equations (private communication with M.

It\ndoes, however, give cost estimates that are representative, even if not precise. The\nparticular figure of merit used in the analysis is the cost of carrying cargo expressed in\n11\n\ndollars per metric ton-kilometer (dollars/ton-n mi). It is intended that the analysis\nyield the total cost to the consumer for hauling cargo on the vehicle. It does not include\nin-port handling. It does account for vehicle utilization and load factor.\nVehicle cost. - The vehicle capital cost is composed of structure cost CST, engine\ncost CE, reactor cost CR, and shield cost CSH. All costs a r e in dollars. Any other\ncapital costs must be included in at least one of these four costs. The total cost is given\nby\nC~~~ = C~~ + C E + CR +CSH\n\nThe cost of the structure in dollars is given by\nCST(dollar s) = 1000 KST(dollar s/kilogram) W ST(metri c tons)\n\nor,\nCST(dollar s ) = 2000 KsT( dollar s/pound mas s)W ST(ton s)\nwhere KST is the unit structure cost and WST is the structure weight.\nThe cost of the engine in dollars is given by\nCE (dollar s) = KE(dollar s/kilogram) WE (kilograms)\n\nor,\nCE (dollars) = KE (dollar s/p Ound mass)WE (pound mas s)\nwhere KE is the unit engine cost and WE is the engine weight.\n.The cost of the reactor in dollars is given by\nCR(dollar s) = KR(dollar s/m egawatt)Pth(m egawatts)\nwhere KR is the unit reactor cost and Pth is the required reactor thermal power.\nThe shield cost in dollars is given by\nCSH(dollars) = 1000 KSH(dollars/kilogram)WSH(metric tons)\n\nor,\ntons)\nCSH(dollars) = 2000 KSH(dollars/pound mass)W SH(\nwhere KSH is the unit shield cost and WSH is the shield weight.\n\n12\n\n(14)\n\nOperating cost. - The total operating cost CkoT is the sum of the following costs\nexpressed in dollars per operating hour:\nC\xe2\x80\x99FC\n\nchemical fuel\n\nC;FN\n%R\n\nshield depreciation\n\nnuclear fuel\n\ncSH\nCh\n\nmaintenance\n\ncrew\n\nCiNT\n\ninterest\n\nstructure depreciation\n\nCiNS\n\ninsurance\n\nCk\n\nmachinery depreciation\n\nCbR\n\nprofit\n\nCk\n\nreactor core depreciation\n\nST\n\nFuel cost. - The chemical fuel cost per operating hour Ckc is found from the following expression, where CFc is the cost of chemical fuel:\nC&(dollars/hour)\n\n= C FC (dollar s/kilogram) S((kilograms/hr)/newton) F(newtons)\n\n(164\nC kC(dollars/hour) = CFC(dollars/pound mass)S((pounds mass/hr)/pounds force)\n\nx F(pounds force)\n\n(16b)\n\nThe nuclear fuel cost per operating hour C b N is given by\n\xe2\x80\x98kN= CF N Pth\n\n(17)\n\nwhere C F N is the cost of nuclear fuel per thermal megawatt-hour produced by fission.\nThe nuclear fuel cost includes nuclear fuel burnup cost, fuel element manufacturing cost,\nfuel reprocessing and shipping costs, and interest charges on unburned nuclear fuel. It\nis intended that CFN covers all costs associated with the nuclear fuel cycle. The reactor cost given by equation (14) therefore does not include fuel element costs because it\nis included in equation (17).\nCrew cost. - The cost of the crew per operating hour CbR is assumed to be a constant. In other words, the number of crew members is independent of vehicle size and\nall other variables.\nDepreciation costs. - The structure depreciation cost per operating hour C i T is\nthe hourly depreciation of the value of the structure. The relation used to determine\nthis cost is\n\n13\n\nwhere CST is the structure cost in dollars and TST is the life of the structure in operating hours. This relation is a crude approximation to the rate at which funds must be\ns e t aside s o that at the end of life enough funds exist to replace the item in question. It\nassumes that the interest accrued by the funds set aside for depreciation doubles the\nactual funds set aside.\nSimilarly, the machinery depreciation cost Ck, the reactor depreciation cost Ck,\nand the shield depreciation cost CkH are given by\n\nMaintenance cost. - The maintenance cost of the entire vehicle per operating hour\nC b is assumed to be proportional to the cost of the vehicle. It is given by\n\xe2\x80\x98M= KMC TOT\n\n(22)\n\nwhere KM is a maintenance cost factor that depends on vehicle type and CTOT is the\ntotal vehicle cost in dollars.\nInterest cost. - The interest cost per operating hour CiNT is given by\n\nc:,,\n\n=K\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\nC\n\nwhere KINT is an interest cost factor which is equal to one-half the interest rate, U is\nthe utilization factor that is the fraction of the total hours in a year that the vehicle operates, and 8760 is the total number of hours in a year.\n\n14\n\n~\n\nInsurance cost.\n\n- The insurance cost per operating hour CiNs is given by\n\nwhere KINs is an insurance cost factor and CTOT is the total vehicle cost in dollars.\nProfit cost. - The profit cost per operating hour CbR is given by\n\nwhere KpR i s a profit cost factor that is equal to the ratio of cost charged to the customer to the total operating cost without a profit margin. The profit, in other words,\nis assumed to be a fraction of the actual cost of providing the transportation service.\nTotal operating cost.\nis given by\n\n- The total operating cost in dollars per operating hour CkOT\n\nThe total operating cost (TOC) i s given by\nCkOT(dollars/hour)\nTOC(dollars/metric ton-kilometer) =\n\npWpAy(metric tons)V(kilometers/hour)\n\n(274\nCkOT(dollar s/hour)\nTOC (dollars/ton-nautical mile) =\n\npWpAy(tons)V(nautical miles/hour)\n\n(27b)\n\nwhere p is the payload factor (ratio of average payload carried to the full payloadcarrying capacity of the vehicle).\n\nASS UM PTI ONS\nThe specific assumptions maL2 and the range for wILL:h each assumption w a s independently investigated are given in this section. This study i s preliminary in nature and\nis intended to indicate performance potential rather than to make precise weight-andcost determinations. It is, therefore, useful and necessary to show sensitivity to each\n\n15\n\nassumption by varying it independently over a wide range of values to lend credibility to\nthe analysis.\n\nPerformance Assumptions\nThe assumptions associated with weight, speed, and power a r e given in this section.\nLift-drag ratio. - The lift-drag ratio L/D for 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) aircraft,\nboth chemical and nuclear, w a s assumed to be 17. It was further assumed to b e independent of the flight speed for the range of flight speeds considered. This is a value that\nis typical of today\xe2\x80\x99s subsonic jet transports. For 3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) aircraft the\nlift-drag ratio w a s assumed to be 20 for both chemical and nuclear aircraft. The higher\nL/D is assumed for two reasons: First, this aircraft is assumed to represent later\ntechnology. Secondly, the authors believe that larger aircraft will resemble flying\nwings, because the space within the wings w i l l have the volumetric capacity to hold the\ncargo, making large fuselages unnecessary.\nStructure weight. - The ratio of structure to gross weight for aircraft used in the\nanalysis is 0.30. It is typical for large subsonic aircraft and is assumed t o be independent of all vehicle and operating variables for the purpose of this analysis. The structure\nfraction is varied from 0. 15 to 0.40 for the reference case to determine sensitivity to\nstructure f r a c tion.\nFuel consumption and efficiency. - The fuel consumption S for chemical turbofan\nengines assumed for this analysis is shown in table I. To determine sensitivity to S,\nit is varied at 925 kilometers per hour (500 knots) from 0.069 to 0.116 kilogram per\nhour per newton (0.68 to 1.14 (lbm/hr)/lbf). For nuclear turbofan engines the overall\nthermal efficiency is assumed to be 0.25.

The efficiency is varied from 0.15 to 0.35 to\ndetermine sensitivity to this assumption.\nEngine weight. - The weight per unit thrust of turbofan engines used in this analysis\nis given in figure 6. Sea-level, zero-flight-speed data from reference 11 were used\nfor 10.7 kilometers (36 000 ft) altitude by applying air-density corrections. The specific engine weight in kilograms per newton and pounds m a s s per pound thrust is plotted\nas a function of flight speed. For nuclear turbofan engines the weight w a s assumed to be\n50 percent greater than for chemical engines to account for the heat exchanger and ducting required for nuclear engines, and also to account for the lower turbine inlet temperature that is typical for nuclear engines. This assumption was varied from 0 to 250 percent.\nReactor weight. - The reactor weight density pR required to calculate reactor\nweight (eq. (5)) is assumed to be 4.8 grams per cubic centimeter (300 lbm/ft 3). The\ndensity is the average of all materials and parts enclosed within the volume formed by\nthe inner diameter of the shield. This density corresponds to a reactor such as shown\nin figure 5. The reactor power density pp is assumed to be 106 watts per cubic centimeter (3.0 NIWth/ft 3). As in the case of the reactor weight density, the volume used to\ncompute power density includes the entire volume enclosed by the inner diameter of the\nshield.\nShield weight. - The shield weight is given by equation (7). The shield is a 4a optimized unit shield composed of optimum-thickness layers of depleted uranium metal and\nwater. As previously mentioned, it is designed to reduce the dose level at 9.15 meters\n(30 ft) from the reactor center to 0.25 millirem per hour. At 30. 5 meters (100 ft) from\nthe reactor centerline, the dose level is about 0.025 millirem per hour. It actually\ncould be less than this depending on how much structure, cargo, o r other material is\nlocated between the measuring station and the reactor. The value of the constant B\nused in equation (7) is 1.0. To obtain a degree of pessimism in the shield weight, any\ndesired value of the constant may be assumed. Shield weight is plotted as a function of\nreactor power in figure 8.\nFuel and range. - The range for chemically powered aircraft is assumed to be 3710,\n7420, and 11 130 kilometers (2000, 4000, and 6000 n mi). For nuclear aircraft, enough\nchemical fuel is carried to give an emergency chemical range of 925 kilometers\n(500 n mi) for the 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) aircraft and 2790 kilometers (1500 n mi)\nfor the 3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) gross weight aircraft at design speed. The emergency chemical range is varied from 0 to 5570 kilometers (0 to 3000 n mi) to determine\nsensitivity to this parameter.\n\n17\n\nPower densit\n~/cm3\n(MWM )\n\n?\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI l l l l\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI IIII\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI Ill\n\nReactor power, MW\nFigure 8. - Shield weight for optimized depleted u r a n i u m and water shield.

The value of\nKST, the structure cost in dollars per pound, assumed for 905-metric-ton (1000-ton)\naircraft is $110 per kilogram ($50/lbm). For the 3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) aircraft,\nKST is $55 per kilogram ($25/lbm). It i s assumed that the need for lower structure\ncost and the potential for reducing cost in larger vehicles will result in a factor-of-2\nreduction in unit structure cost for the larger aircraft. This assumption is varied from\n$22 to $165 per kilogram ($10 to $75/lbm) to determine sensitivity.\nInitial engine cost. - The engine cost is given by equation (13). The value of KE\nassumed for this analysis i s $132 per kilogram ($60/lbm) for chemical engines. For\nnuclear engines the cost i s assumed to be 1.25 times the corresponding chemical engine\ncost. The nuclear engine cost does not include the cost of the reactor shield or the nuclear fuel. These costs a r e considered separately.\nInitial reactor cost. - The reactor cost is given by equation (14). The value of the\n\n18\n\nconstant KR(dollars/MWth) used for this analysis is 3500. The cost includes only the\ncost of the reactor vessel, the core structure, in-core control equipment, and other\nitems within the shield. It does not include the fuel element cost. The fuel element cost\nis included in the nuclear fuel cost. The reactor cost is varied from $1500 to $10 000\nper megawatt thermal to determine sensitivity to this parameter.\nInitial shield cost. - The initial shield cost i s given by equation (15). The value of\nISSH used for this analysis is $11 per kilogram ($5/lbm). This is based on a water and\ndepleted-uranium shield with a stainless-steel containment vessel included in the shield.\nThe shield cost i s varied from $4.4 to $55 per kilogram ($2 to $20/lbm) to determine\nsensitivity.\nFuel cost. - Fuel cost is given by equation (16) for chemically fueled vehicles. The\nunit fuel cost CFc assumed i s $0.0264 per kilogram ($0.012/lbm). This corresponds\nto a cost of about 8 cents per gallon of jet fuel. Nuclear fuel cost is found by use of\nequation (17). The unit nuclear fuel cost CFN assumed for this analysis is $0.50 per\nmegawatt thermal-hour. This corresponds to $12 per gram of uranium-235, or is equivalent to about 1.7 mils per kilowatt-hour of electrical energy for a nuclear electric\npowerplant with a thermal efficiency of 30 percent. The fuel cost includes manufacturing\nfuel elements, reprocessing and shipping, interest on unburned fuel, and all other\ncharges normally credited to fuel cost. The value of fuel cost i s varied from $4 to $24\nper gram to indicate sensitivity of the results to fuel cost assumption.\nCrew cost. - The crew cost is assumed to be $250 per operating hour for all vehicles studied in this analysis. This corresponds to the cost of crewing an aircraft like\nthe Boeing 747 (ref. 12). This assumption is justified on the basis that an all-cargo\noperation does not -require a large crew. It is further assumed that all vehicles are\nautomated to the extent of a large aircraft s o that only a small operating crew is required.\nDepreciation cost. - The depreciation costs a r e calculated by equations (18) to (21).\nThe life assumed for each depreciation cost is as follows:\nStructure life, TST, operating hours . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nMachinery life, TE, operating hours . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nReactor structure life, TR, operating hours . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nShield life, TSH, operating hours . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n75 000\n50 000\n50 000\n75 000\n\nThe structure life w a s varied from 25 000 to 100 000 hours to determine sensitivity.\nMaintenance cost. - Maintenance cost i s given by equation (22). The maintenance\ncost factor KM is assumed to b e 15X10-6. This corresponds to the maintenance cost\nof Boeing 747 operation (ref. 12), which is varied from 4X10-6 to 3OX1Om6to determine\nsensitivity.\nInterest cost. - Interest cost is given by equation (23).

The insurance cost factor KINs is assumed to be 3.5. This corresponds to the experience f o r the Boeing 747\n(ref. 12).\nProfit cost. - The profit cost is given by equation (25). The profit factor KpR\nthat is assumed for this analysis is 1.20. This assumes that the cost of the transportation service to the customer is 20 percent greater than the actual cost of providing the\nservice. This assumption is varied from 10 to 30 percent to determine the sensitivity\nof the results to this assumption.\nAll the assumptions used in this analysis and the range over which each is varied\nare presented in table II.\nAll the results are plotted to show only the effect on total operating cost, which is\nused as the figure of merit. More complete tabular data of all calculated quantities\nare presented for only a few representative costs because of the large volume of calculations. This information is presented in appendix B.\n\nRESULTS\nCalculations of estimated total operating cost as a function of speed were made for\n905- and 3620-metric-ton (1000- and 4000-ton) aircraft. The assumptions made in the\nanalysis a r e intended to reflect attainable performance in the post-1980 time period.\nThe corresponding. weight breakdowns are also presented to indicate the magnitude of\nthe important weight factors. In addition, the sensitivity of performance to most of the\nassumptions used is presented. The total operating cost is plotted against each varying\nassumption while the remaining assumptions a r e fixed. This is done for a speed of\n925 kilometers per hour (500 knots).\nThe total operating cost that is used in this analysis is to be contrasted to the direct\noperating cost that i s normally used in transportation studies. For example, the usual\ndirect operating cost does not include profit, which is included in the total operating\ncost as used herein. The total operating cost is intended to be the cost charged to the\nconsumer for transportation. It does not, however, include the cost of handling, storing, or shipping the cargo in the originating or destination port. These charges can be\nmajor items and must be considered in evaluating a total transportation system. It is\nalso recognized that serious attention must be given to the design, operation, and geographical location of port facilities to properly evaluate a total system. A study of this\ntype is beyond the scope of this analysis.\n\n21\n\nThe 905-Metric-Ton (1000-Ton) Aircraft\nThe 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) aircraft is intended to be representative of the next\ngeneration of aircraft beyond the jumbo jets of today. It is assumed that the structure\nweight fraction is 0.30 and lift-drag ratio is 17 that is typical of today\'s technology. It\nis assumed that the cost of the aircraft structure is $110 per kilogram ($50/lbm) and\nthat the engine cost per pound is about the same as today. Nuclear-powered aircraft\nare assumed to have complete 4n shielding, with dose levels from reactor radiation\nless than cosmic radiation doses at 10.7 kilometers (35 000 ft). The 905-metricton (1000-ton) nuclear aircraft has an emergency chemical fuel supply sufficient for\n925 kilometers (500 n mi) flight at design\'conditions with the nuclear reactor shut down.\nA complete list of assumptions made to carry out the analysis is given in the section ASSUMPTIONS.\nThe total operating cost for nuclear- and chemical-powered aircraft is presented in\nfigure 9. The chemical aircraft data a r e plotted for ranges of 3710, 7420, and 11 130\nkilometers (2000, 4000, and 6000 n mi). For a range of about 9275 kilometers (5000\nn mi) or greater, the 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) nuclear aircraft costs l e s s to operate\nthan chemical aircraft of equal size. The total operating cost for chemical aircraft with\ntransoceanic ranges of 7420 and 11 130 kilometers (4000 and 6000 n mi) is about $0.024\nand $0.036 per metric ton-kilometer ($0.040 and $0.060 ton-n mi), respectively, for\nspeeds of 740 kilometers per hour (400 knots). The nuclear aircraft total operating cost\nis about $0.027 per metric ton-kilometer ($0.045 ton-n mi) at 740 kilometers per hour\nRange,\nkm (n mi)\n11 I30 (6000)\n\nChemical aircraft\nNuclear aircraft\n\n-/-e\n-\n\n.\n\n0\n\n300\n\n3\n\nt\n\n7420 (4000)\n\nL\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nFlight speed, knots\nFigure 9. -Total operating cost as function of speed for chemical- and nuclearpowered aircraft.

The premium the consumer is\nwilling to pay for the speed advantage offered by cargo aircraft and the degree of cost\nsaving due to high-speed cargo movement w i l l determine the fraction of the total cargo\nmarket that the 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) aircraft will capture.\nIt is beyond the scope of the report to make a detailed analysis of the effect of flight\nspeed. For example, careful variation of engine performance with flight speed w a s not\nattempted: the aircraft L/D w a s not varied with speed, structure weight was not varied\nwith speed, etc. With the limitations imposed by these qualifications, the sensitivity to\nspeed does not appear to be of first-order importance. There does appear to be an\noptimum speed in the range of 650 to 740 kilometers per hour (350 to 400 knots) for nuclear aircraft and for chemical aircraft with flight ranges of 7420 to ll 130 kilometers\n(4000 to 6000 n mi).\nThe corresponding weight breakdowns for the 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) aircraft\na r e shown in figures lO(a) to (d). The payload fraction for the nuclear aircraft is about\n0.23 for a speed of 740 kilometers per hour (400 knots). The reactor, shield, and engines constitute about 42 percent of the g r o s s weight for this speed. The emergency\nchemical fuel supply for 925 kilometers (500 n mi) range at design conditions is about\n4.5 percent of the g r o s s weight.\nFor chemical aircraft the fuel weight is 18, 32, and 44 percent of the gross weight\nfor ranges of 3710, 7420, and 11 130 kilometers (2000, 4000, and 6000 n mi), respectively, for a speed of 925 kilometers per hour (500 knots). The payload fraction varies\nfrom 47 to 32 to 21 percent of the gross weight for ranges of 3770, 7420, and 11 130\nkilometers (2000, 4000, and 6000 n mi), respectively. The payload fraction for the\n11 130-kilometer (6000-n mi) range chemical aircraft is almost the same as the payload\nfraction for the nuclear aircraft. The nuclear aircraft indicates a lower total operating\ncost, however, because of the much lower nuclear fuel cost. Even though the initial\ncost of the nuclear aircraft is greater than that of the chemical aircraft, the effect of\nthe lower fuel cost dominates. Thus, the nuclear aircraft appears attractive for transoceanic commerce if the gross weight is about 905 metric tons (1000 tons). It theoretically would take a fleet of 500 of these nuclear aircraft t o carry 1 percent of the transoceanic commerce predicted for 1980. Whether this fraction of the ocean commerce is\nof sufficient value t o warrant shipment with transportation rates of about $0.027 per\nmetric ton-kilometer ($0.045/ton-n mi) would help determine whether the large nuclear\naircraft would be economically feasible. This point is certainly worth investigating\nfurther, but is beyond the scope of this report.\n\n23\n\n.H\nS\nm\n.E\n0\n\n(b) Chemical aircraft; range, 3710 kilometers ( X I 0 n mi).\n\n(a) Nuclear aircraft.\n\nL\nc\n\nc\n\n550\n\n650\n\n750\n\n350\n\n400\n\n850\n\n950\n\nFlight speed, k m l h r\n\nJ\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n1\n\n500\n\n300\n\nFlight speed, knots\n\n(c) Chemical aircraft; range, 7420 kilometers (4000 n mi).\n\n450\n\n500\n\n(d) Chemical aircraft; range, 11 130 kilometers (6ooo n mi).\n\nFigure 10. - W e i g h t breakdown as f u n c t i o n of speed for chemical- and nuclear-powered aircraft of 905 metric t o n s\nS t r u c t u r e weight fraction, 0.30.\n\n( O -tons) gross weight.\n1IN\n\nThe 3620-Metric-Ton (4000-Ton) Aircraft\nThe 3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) aircraft represents anticipated performance beyond\n1980. The major difference between the 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) aircraft and the\n3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) aircraft is that the assumed structure cost is reduced from\n$110 to $55 per kilogram ($50 to $25/lbm) and the lift-drag ratio is increased from\n17 to 20 due to advances in technology and effects of larger scale. The emergency chemical cruising range is increased from 925 kilometer (500 n mi) to 2775 kilometers (1500\nn mi) for the 3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) nuclear aircraft.\n24\n\n. 0 6 y\n\nChemical aircraft\n\n0\n\n550\n\n650\n\n300\n\n350\n\n750\nFlight speed, k m l h r\n\n950\n\n850\n\nI\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nFlight speed, knots\n\n1\nFigure 1 . -Total operating cost as function of speed f o r chemical- and nuclearpowered aircraft.

The chemical aircraft data a r e plotted for ranges\nof 3710, 7420, and 11 130 kilometers (2000, 4000, and 6000 n mi). For a range of\n4565 kilometers (3000 n mi) or greater, the nuclear aircraft costs less to operate than\ndo chemical aircraft. For transoceanic flights, which require ranges of the order of\n7420 to 11 130 kilometers (4000 to 6000 n mi), the total operating cost for chemical aircraft varies from about $0.014 to $0.022 per metric ton-kilometer ($0.024 to $0.037/\nton-n mi) at a speed of 925 kilometers per hour (500 knots). The total operating cost\nfor nuclear aircraft is about $0.012 per metric ton kilometer ($0.02O/ton-n mi) at\n925 kilometers per hour (500 knots). The operating costs can be reduced only slightly\nby reducing speed. The minimum operating cost shown for nuclear aircraft occurs at\nspeeds of about 700 to 790 kilometers per hour (375 t o 425 knots) and is about $0.0107\nper metric ton-kilometer ($0.018/ton-n mi). A feature of nuclear aircraft is that the\ntotal operating cost is independent of range.\nThe corresponding weight breakdowns for the nuclear- and chemical-powered 3620metric-ton (4000-ton) aircraft a r e presented in figures 12(a) to (d). For the nuclear\naircraft the payload varies from about 40 percent to 30 percent of the gross weight for\nspeeds ranging from 740 to 925 kilometers per hour (300 to 500 knots), respectively.\nThe reactor, shield, and engines constitute about 20 to 27 percent of the gross weight\nfor this same speed range. The emergency chemical fuel supply that will give a 2775kilometer (1500-n mi) range at design flight conditions i s about 12 percent of the gross\nweight.\n25\n\n1\n\nJ\n\nr\n.u\n\n0\nc\n\n2\n\n(b) Chemical aircraft; range, 3710 kilometers (XKN)n mi).\n\n(a) Nuclear aircraft.\n\nL\n\ni\n\nv,\n.-\n\n5\n\n6\n%\n\n750\n\n1\n\n850\n\n950\n\n550\n\n650\n\n750\n\n350\n\n400\n\n850\n\n950\n\nFlight speed, k m l h r\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n300\n\n500\n\n450\n\nFlight speed, knots\n(c) Chemical aircraft; range, 74M kilometers (4000 n mi).\n\n(d) Chemical aircraft; range, 1 UO kilometers ( 6 w O\n1\n\nn\n\nmil.\n\nFigure 12. - W e i g h t breakdown as function of speed for chemical- and nuclear-powered aircraft of 36M metric tons (4000 tons) gross weight.\nS t r u c t u r e weight fraction, 0.30.\n\nFor chemical aircraft the fuel weight fraction becomes dominant as range is increased to 11 130 kilometers (6000 n mi). The fuel fractions for transoceanic ranges\nof 7420 and 11 130 kilometers (4000 and 6000 n mi) are about 30 and 40 percent, respectively, at speeds in the range of 550 to 925 kilometers per hour (300 to 500 knots). The\nchemical aircraft payload fractions for 7420- and 11 130-kilometer (4000-and 6000n mi) ranges are about 35 and 25 percent, respectively, for the same speed range. The\npayload fractions a r e not greatly different from those for nuclear aircraft. The superior performance of the nuclear aircraft on a cost basis is chiefly due to the lower cost\nof nuclear fuel. The greatly reduced fuel cost more than compensate for the higher\n26\n\ncapital cost of the nuclear aircraft.\nThe payload delivery capability of a 3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) nuclear aircraft is\nabout 0. 95 billion metric ton-kilometers (1.6 billion ton-n mi) per year, including the\nassumption of a load factor of 0.6 and utilization of 0. 5. A fleet of 1000 of these aircraft theoretically could haul 8 percent of the world transoceanic cargo trade predicted\nfor 1980 or 4 percent of that predicted for 1995. These predictions do not take into account any increase in trade that would probably be attracted by the high-speed of\nair transportation. Lower inventory costs and the possibility of shipping perishable\ngoods are examples of the factors that will determine the amount of additional trade attracted by the high speed.\n\nSensitivity to Assumptions\nIn a broad analysis of the kind presented in this study many assumptions must be\nmade to arrive at specific numbers such as total operating cost. To completely justify\neach assumption so that no one would question any of them would be at best an impossible dream. Therefore, the authors have taken the liberty, first of all, to greatly simplify the analysis s o as to minimize the number of variables that a r e considered and,\nsecondly, to select reference values for each of the variables considered. It was the\nintent to select what a r e thought to be reasonable projected values for each of the variables. However, recognizing that there is a great possibility that the reference values\nmay be questioned, almost every variable was independently varied to determine the\nsensitivity of the results to the particular assumed value. The effect on total operating\ncost caused by varying each of the major variables is plotted in the next series of figures.\nParts (a) to (t) of figures 13 and 14 show the effect of varying the following variables\non the total operating cost for 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) and 3620-metric-ton (4000-ton)\naircraft , respectively:\n(1) Lift-drag ratio\nSpecific fuel consumption\nThermal efficiency\n(2) Structure weight fraction\nChemical range for nuclear aircraft\n(3) Structure cost\nRatio of nuclear to chemical engine\n(4) Gross weight\nweight\n(5) Load factor\nUranium fuel cost\n(6) Utilization factor\nReactor cost\n(7) Maintenance cost factor\nShield cost\n(8) Interest rate\nRatio of nuclear to chemical engine\n(9) Profit rate\ncost\n(10) Structure life\nReactor power density\n(11)Chemical fuel cost\n27\n\nChemical aircraft\n\n-\n\n16\n\n0\n\n0\n\n40\n\n36\n\n(bl Structure weight fraction.\n\n(a1 Lift-drag ratio.,\n\ni\n\n24\n28\n32\nStructure weight fraction\n\n20\n\n-\n\nI Reference\n\nReference\n\n80\n120\nUnit structure cost, dollarslkg\n\n200\n\n10\n6\n\nI\n\n20\n40\n60\nUnit structure costt, dollarsllbm\n\n80\n\n(c) Unit structure cost.\n\n. 10\n\n-\n\n._\n\nz .oe\n\n.06r\nE\nY\n\n-\n\n-\n\n& .05\n\n0\nc\n\n0\nc\n\n+\n\nm\nL\n\n.06 -\n\n.-B\nD\n\nF\n._\n\n.01\n\n-\n\ng\n\n+\n\n0\nv1\n\n.c\nP\n\nP\n\n8\n\ni\n\n.02\n\n.o; - 8\n\nI Reference\nc -\n\n0\n.3\n\n.4\n\n.5\n\n.6\n.7\nLoad factor\n\nI\n\n.8\n\n.9\n\n1.0\n\n( e ) Load factor.\nFigure 13. - Effect of variation of major assumptions on total operating cost for chemical- and nuclear-powered aircraft of 905 metric tons (loo0 tons)\ngross weight.\n\n28\n\nJ\n\n40\n\nChemical aircraft\nNuclear aircraft\n\nr\n\nRange,\nkm (n mi)\n\n1 I30 (6000)\n1\n\n.03\n\n-\n\n.02\n\n-\n\nI\n\n-\n\nI\n\nI\n7420 (4000)\n\nI\n\nOol\n\n0\n\n.4\n\n3710 (MOO)\n\nF\n\nReference\n\nI\n\n.5\n\nReference\n\nI\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\n.6\n\n.7\n.8\n.9\nUtilization, yearly operating hours/8760\n\n6\n\n.O6r\n-\n\n.04\n\n24\n\n~OXIO-~\n\n(g) Maintenance cost factor.\n\nr\n\n-\n\n.03\n\n18\n\nMaintenance cost factor\n\n(f) Utilization factor.\n\n.05\n\n12\n\n-\n\n1 l30 ~6OOo)\n1\n\n----+----I\n\n.02\n\n-rr\n\n3710 (MOO)\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x991 1\n0\n.06\n\n.07\n\nReference\n\nReference\n\n.W\n\n.08\n\n.IO\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nInterest rate\n\n(h) Interest rate.\n\n--\n\n.02\n\nI\n\n.03\n\nS\n\nn\n\n30\n\nti) Profit rate.\n\nV\n0\n\nW\n\n25\n\nPercent profit\n\n7 4 M (4000)\n\n=\n\n3710 (MOO)\n\n1\n\n0\n\ni\n\n.010\n25\n\n50\n\nReference\n100?103\n\n75\nStructure life, hr\n\n(j) Structure life.\nFigure\n\nU. - Continued.\n\n29\n\n--_\n\nRange,\nkm (n mi)\n\n.10\n\nChemical aircraft\nNuclear aircraft\n\n.06\n\n.04\n.02\n\n-\n\n.-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nc\nL\n\n-\n\n.015\n\'\n\n.OM\n\n.025\n.030\n.035\nChemical fuel cost, dollarslkg\n\n.040\n\n.06\n\n.07\n\nL\nm\n\n-\n\nu\n0\n\nI\n\nu\n0\n\nc\n0\n\nu\nm\n\n.010\n.012\n.014\n.016\nChemical fuel cost, dollars/lbm\n\n.008\n\nc\n-\n\n0"\n\n.08\n.09\n.10\nFuel consumption, (kg/hr)lN\n\n.12\n\n.8\n.9\n1.0\n1.1\nFuel consumption, (Ibmlhrlllbf\n\n.7\n\n.OH\n\n. 11\n\n1.2\n\n(k) Chemical fuel cost.\n\n(Z) Fuel consumption.\n\nr\n\n.02\n0\n\nI-:f\n10\n\nI\n\n15\n\n!\n\n3710 (2000)\n\n3710 (2000)\n\n, , ,\n\nReference\n\nI\n\nReference\n\n40\n\n20\n25\n30\n35\nNuclear thermal efficiency, percent\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(m) Nuclear thermal efficiency.\n\n400\n800\n1Mo\n1600\nChemical range for nuclear aircraft, km\n\n2w\n400\n600\n800\n1000\nChemical range for nuclear aircraft, n mi\n(n) Emergency chemical range.\n\n.06/\n\n/\n\n/\n\'\n\nllUO(6000)\n\n.\'-\n\nI\n\n/\n\'\n\n</\n\n.\n\'\n\n.06\n\n3710 (2000)\n\nc\n\nP\n\nI\n0\n1.0\n\nReference\n\nu\n\n1.5\n2.0\nRatio of nuclear to chemical engine weight\n\n(01 Ratio of nuclear to chemical engine weight.\nFigure 13.\n\n30\n\n-\n\nContinued.\n\n2000\n\n2.5\n\nRanse\nkm (n. m. 1\n\n\'lor . 0 6 r\n\nI\n\n- e -\n\n.02\n\n.O1\n\nt\n\n0\n\nI\n\n7420(4000)\n\n3710 (2000)\n\n-\n\nI\n\n3710 (20001\n\n-\n\n[Reference\n4\n\n11 UO (6000)\n\nI----------\n\n-\n\n7420 (4000)\n\nI\n\nt\n\nI\n\n-\n\nI\n\n.04\n\n-\n\n11 UO(6000)\n_/---\n\n.04\n\nChemical aircrafl\nNuclear aircrafl\n\n--_\n\nReference\n\n8\n12\n16\nUranium fuel cost, dollarslg\n\n20\n\n24\n\n(p) Uranium fuel cost.\n\n11 130 (6030)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nI\nI\n\n3710 (20001\n\nIRef e re m\n\n.\' O l 2 L\n0\n\n0\n\nI\nO\n\n0\n\n4\n\n20\n30\nUnit shield cost, dollarslkg\n\n8\n12\n16\nUnit shield cost, dollarsllbm\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0\n\n3710 (2000)\n\nI\n\n1.25\n1.

However, with the exception of g r o s s weight, variations of these parameters do not affect significantly the relative merit of chemical and nuclear aircraft.\nFor the ranges of these variables presenfed, the 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) nuclear aircraft gives better performance than the chemical aircraft for ranges of 9275 kilometers\n(5000 n mi) o r greater. Significant improvement can b e obtained by increasing gross\nweight of the nuclear aircraft.\nIncreasing the lift-drag ratio from 17 to 20 causes an important reduction in total\noperating cost of nuclear and chemical vehicles, especially for the longest ranges.\nThe longer range chemical aircraft a r e more sensitive to structure weight fraction\nthan lower range chemical or nuclear aircraft because the payload fraction is smaller\nfor the longer range chemical aircraft.\nThe structure cost is one of the more important fractions of t h e total cost. Variations in it, therefore, cause marked effects on the total operating cost. Increasing the\nstructure cost to $165 per kilogram ($75/lbm) increases the total operating cost by about\n20 percent for both nuclear and chemical aircraft.\nThe gross weight has a more important effect on nuclear aircraft performance than\non chemical aircraft performance. This is because the shield weight of the nuclear aircraft does not change in direct proportion with aircraft size. The shield weight varies\napproximately as the 0.4 or 0.5 exponent of the reactor power (hence, gross weight).\nTherefore, reducing gross weight has the effect of increasing the fraction of the gross\nweight that i s shield weight. This reduces the payload fraction. As shown in figure\n13(d) for gross weights of less than 905 metric tons (1000 tons), the operating cost of\nthe nuclear aircraft increases rapidly. Conversely, as gross weight is increased, the\nshield weight fraction reduces and the operating cost decreases.\nThe load factor affects performance strongly because it directly affects the efficiency of operation. Reducing the load factor by one-third increases the total operating\ncost by 50 percent for all aircraft, nuclear o r chemical, regardless of range.\nOf l e s s importance to the cost performance for both nuclear and chemical aircraft\nis utilization factor, maintenance factor, interest rate, profit rate, and structure life\n(figs. 13(f) to (j)).\nThe chemical fuel cost and fuel consumption (figs. 13(k) and ( 1 ) ) are important especially for chemical aircraft. These factors also affect somewhat the relative cost\nperformance of chemical and nuclear aircraft.\nFor nuclear aircraft, thermal efficiency, emergency chemical range, and the ratio\nof nuclear engine weight to chemical engine weight (figs. 13 (m), (n), and (0))\nare of\n32\n\nc\n\n-\n\nChemical aircraft\nNuclear aircraft\n\nI\n\n\' Reference\n1\n\n16\n\n18\n\n130 (6000)\n\n1\n,1\n\nReference\n\n20\n22\nLift-drag ratio\n\n24\n\n.24\n\n,213\n\n26\n\n.28\n.32\n.36\nStructure weight fraction\n\nJ\n\n.44\n\n.40\n\n(b) Structure weight fraction.\n\n(a) Lift-drag ratio.\n\n-\n\n-\'\\.\n\n1 l30 (moo)\n1\n\n-\n\nI\n\nMoo\n\nReference\n\n4000\n\n7420 (4000)\n\n3710 (2000)\n\n8000\n\n6000\n\n10 000\n\nGross weight, metric tons\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n6000\nGross weight, tons\n\n8000\n\n10 000\n\n(d) Gross weight.\n\nr\n\n.04-\n\n-\n\n1 l30 (6000)\n1\n\n-\n\n.02\n.02\n\n0\n\n11 l30 (6000)\n\n7420 (4000)\n\n.01\n0\n\n.4\n\nReference\n\n3710 (2000)\n\n.5\n\n.7\nLoad factor\n\n.6\n\n---.\n-\n\n-----_\n.8\n\n.9\n\nJ\n1.0\n\n-----------____\n3710 (2000)\nReferenc\n\nJ\n\n(e) Load factor.\n\n.-\n\n.04r\n\nE\n\n----- __---k\n\n7420 (4000)\n\nc\n-\n\nr\n\n5 .01-\n\nr\n\n3710 (2000)\n\nReference\n\nP\n\n0\n\n2\n!\n1\'8\ni4\nMaintenance cost factor\n\n~OX!O-~\n\n(g) Maintenance cost factor.\nFigure 14. - Effect of variation of major assumptions on total operating cost for chemical- and nuclear-powered aircraft of 3620 metric tons (4000 tons) gross\nweight.\n\n33\n\n.06\n\n-\n\nr\n\n-Chemicalaircraft\naircraft\nNuclear\n\nr\n\nRange,\n\ni\n-\n\nkm (n mi)\n\n11 DO (6000)\n\n11 D Im)\nO\n\n7420 (4000)\n\n7420 (4053)\n3710 ( M O O )\n\n.01\n\n3710 (2000)\n\nReference\n\nO.06\n\n.07\n\n.OX\nInterest rate\n\n(Reference\n\n.09\n\n.10\n\n10\n\nM\n\n15\n\n25\nPercent profit\n\n1\n\n35\n\n(i)\nProfit rate.\n\n(h) Interest rate.\n\nE\n\n-Y\n\n30\n\n.04-\n\n.03-\n\n--\n\n11 D (6000)\nO\n.02-\n\n7420\n--------------_---(4000)\n\n0\n\n.01-\n\n3710 (2wo)\nReference\n\n1\n\nCj) Structure life.\n\nr\n\n.04r\n\n7420 ~4000)\n3710 (2000)\n0\n.06\n\n.07\n\n.OX\n.09\n.l0\n.ll\nFuel consumption, (kg/hr)/N\n\n.12\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\n30\nThermal efficiency, percent\n\n( I I\nI (\nI\n(\n\n.6\n\n.7\n\n.8\n.9\n1.0\n1.1\nFuel consumption, (Ibm/hr)/lbf\n\n1.2\n\n(U Fuel consumption.\n\n(ml Nuclear thermal efficiency.\n\n7420 t4000) _/I-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4wO\nMO\nO\nChemical range for nuclear aircraft, km\n\nI\n\n500\n1000\n1500\nMOO\n2500\nChemical range for nuclear aircraft, n mi\n(n) Emergency chemical range.\n\nFigure 14.\n\n34\n\n-\n\nContinued.\n\n6000\n\n3wo\n\n35\n\n40\n\n---\n\nc\n\nNuclear aircraft\nkm (n mi)\n1 D (6000)\n1 O\n\n.04\n\n1 D (6000)\n1 O\n\n-\n\n.02\n\n_---- ___--- (2000)\n3710\n7420 (4ooo)\n\n0\n\nI Reference\n\nL\n\n[Reference\n\n1.5\n2.0\nRatio of nuclear to chemical engine weight\n(0)Ratio of\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2.5\n\nI\n\nI.\n\nnuclear to chemical engine weight.\n\n.04.06\n\n$\n\n7420\n___------(4000)\nReference\n\nm\n\n0\n.\n\nE?\n\nm\n\nO\n\nL\n\n+-\n\n3710 (MOO)\n\n3710 (2000)\n\nMoo\n4000\n6000\n8000\nUnit reactor core cost, dollars/MWt\n\nReference\n10000\n\n0\n\n10\n\nM\n\n20\n30\n40\nUnit shield cost, dollarslkg\n\nm\n\nI\n-\n\n4\n\nI\n-\n\n0\n\n( q ) Unit reactor cost.\n\n4\n\n8\n12\n16\nUnit shield cost, dollarsllbm\n\n20\n\n(r)Unit shield cost.\n\n.04-\n\n.0311 130 (6000)\n\n7420 (4000)\n.02\n\n3710 (MOO)\nReference\n0\n\n0\n1.00\n\n1.25\n1 50\n.\n1.75\nRatio of nuclear to chemical engine cost\n\nReference\n\n2 00\n\n0\n\nI\n400\n\n100\n200\n300\nReactor power density, Wlcm3\n\n1\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n\n0\n\nReactor power density, MW/ff3\n\n(s) Ratio of nuclear t o chemical engine cost.\n\n(t) Reactor power density.\n\nFigure 14. - Concluded.\n\n35\n\nimportance.

Increasing emergency chemical range from\n925 to 1850 kilometers (500 to 1000 n mi) would cause an increase of 50 percent in\noperating cost.\nUranium fuel cost, reactor\'cost, shield cost, and the ratio of nuclear engine cost\nto chemical engine cost (figs. 13(p) to (s))appear to have little effect on operating cost\nbecause they a r e not large items in the overall cost. Reactor power density (fig. 13(t))\nis an important parameter for the 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) nuclear aircraft. Values\nl e s s than 106 watts per cubic centimeter (3 MW/ft 3) lead to large increases in operating\ncost. An increase to 247 or 283 watts per cubic centimeter (7 or 8 MW/ft 3) could reduce\noperational cost by a factor of 2.\n3620-Metric-ton (4000-ton) aircraft. - Examination of figures 14(a) to (t) shows that\nthe variables that could affect the total operating cost most a r e lift-drag ratio, structure\nweight fraction, unit structure cost, load factor (figs. 14(a) to (e) and (e)) for both\nchemical and nuclear aircraft and reactor power density. Variations of these parameters, however, do not affect relative performance between nuclear and chemical aircraft, except in the case of gross weight. As previously explained, the nondirect variation of shield weight with reactor power causes a rapid increase in operating cost at low\ngross weights. For the ranges shown for each of these variables, the nuclear aircraft\nshows superior performance for flight ranges above 4565 kilometers (3000 n mi). For\na range of 11 130 kilometers (6000 n mi) the nuclear aircraft should weigh 1500 tons or\nmore to economically outperform the chemical aircraft for the set of assumptions made\nfor the more advanced and larger aircraft.\nOf less importance are utilization factor, maintenance cost factor, interest rate,\nprofit rate, and structure life (figs. 14(f) to (j)).\nFor chemical aircraft the chemical fuel cost and fuel consumption (figs. 14(k)\nand (I)) are important and affect the relative standing of nuclear and chemical aircraft\nperformance somewhat. For example, if the fuel consumption could be reduced from\n0.093 kilogram per hour per newton to 0.073 kilogram per hour per newton (0.91 (lbm/\nhr)/lbf to 0.73 (lbm/hr)/lbf), the break-even range would be about 7420 kilometers\n(4000 n mi) instead of about 4565 kilometers (3000 n mi).\nFor nuclear aircraft, thermal efficiency, emergency chemical range, and reactor\npower density (figs. 14(m), (n), and (0))a r e of importance. Decreasing the thermal\nefficiency from 25 percent to 15 percent increases total operating cost from about $0.012\nto $0.018 per metric ton-kilometer ($0.020 to $0.030/ton-n mi). The reactor power\ndensity is not important as long as it is 106 watts per cubic centimeter (3 MW/ft 3) or\ngreater. Reducing the power density to 35 watts per cubic centimeter from 106 watts\nper cubic centimeter (to 1 MW/ft 3 from 3 MW/ft 3) increases the total operating cost to\nabout $0.024 per metric ton-kilometer from $0.012 per metric ton-kilometer (to $0.040/\nton-n mi from $0.02O/tsn-n mi).\n36\n\nIncreasing emergency chemical range from 2780 kilometers to 5560 kilometers\n(1500 n mi to 3000 n mi) has a similar effect on operating cost. Uranium fuel cost, reactor cost, shield cost, ratio of nuclear to chemical engine weight, and ratio of nuclear\nto chemical engine cost (figs. 14(p) to (t)), have little effect on the 3620-metric-ton\n(4000-ton) nuclear aircraft performance.\n\nSUMMARY O RESULTS\nF\nA simplified performance and cost study of large subsonic chemical- and nuclearpowered aircraft has been carried out to determine the potential for transoceanic commerce. The study indicates that aircraft with a g r o s s weight of 905 metric tons\n(1000 tons) yield a total operating cost of about $0.024 to $0.036 per metric tonkilometer ($0.040 to $0.06O/ton-n mi), including a load factor of 0.6 and utilization of\n0.5. For ranges above 9275 kilometers (5000 n mi) the 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) nuclear aircraft shows better performance than 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) chemical aircraft. At a speed of 740 kilometers per hour (400 knots) the 905-metric-ton (1000-ton)\nnuclear aircraft shows a total operating cost of $0.027 per metric ton-kilometer\n($0.045/ton-n mi). The payload is 23 percent of the gross weight. A fleet of 500 such\naircraft would theoretically be capable of handling 1 percent of the forecast world ocean\ntrade in 1980. What fraction of the total ocean trade and what further increase in trade\nwould be stimulated by high-speed air transportation is worthy of further study, but is\nbeyond the scope of this report.\nOperating cast can be substantially reduced by increasing the gross weight from\n905 metric tons to 3620 metric tons (1000 tons to 4000 tons). The total operating cost\nfor 3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) nuclear aircraft i s less than $0.012 per metric tonkilometer ($0.02/ton-n mi) at speeds of 925 kilometers per hour (500 knots). This\nlow cost comes about for two reasons. The first is that it is assumed that the unit cost\nof aircraft structure is reduced from $110 per kilogram to $55 per kilogram ($50/lbm\nto $25/lbm) because of an assumed favorable effect of vehicle size and advanced technology on construction cost. Secondly, the lift-drag ratio is increased from 17 to 20 to\nreflect aerodynamic improvements. In the case of the nuclear aircraft, increasing size\nhas an additional benefit. The shield becomes a smaller fraction of the gross weight,\nwhich results in a direct increase in payload fraction. The payload fraction of 3620metric-ton (4000-ton) nuclear aircraft is about 30 to 40 percent of the gross weight,\nmore than 50 percent greater than for the 905-metric-ton (1000-ton) nuclear aircraft.\nThe reduction in nuclear powerplant weight yields a further gain relative to chemical\naircraft. The break-even range between chemical and nuclear aircraft is l e s s than\n4565 kilometers (3000 n mi) for the 3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) aircraft. A fleet of 1000\n37\n\n3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) nuclear aircraft would theoretically handle 8 percent of the\nforecast world trade in 1980 and only 4 percent of the trade in 1995.\nSensitivity of all the major assumptions was determined by varying each one while\nholding the remainder constant. The most important assumptions a r e lift -drag ratio,\nstructure weight fraction, unit structure cost, gross weight, and load factor. Simultaneous improvement in two or three of these factors might lead to total operating costs\nof less than $0.012 per metric ton-kilometer ($0. Ol/ton-n mi). For example, for the\n3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) nuclear aircraft, if lift-drag ratio would b e increased to 24,\nstructure weight fraction reduced to 0.25, structure cost reduced to $33 per kilogram\n($15/lbm), and load factor increased to 0.8, the total operating cost would be about\n$0.005 per metric ton-kilometer ($0.0085/ton-n mi).\nFor nuclear aircraft the reactor power density should be 106 watts per cubic centimeter (3 MW/ft 3) or greater to yield cost performance superior to chemical aircraft\nfor gross weights of 905 metric tons (1000 tons). The gross weight of the nuclear aircraft should be greater than about 800 metric tons to show cost performance better than\nthat of chemical aircraft for ranges of l e s s than 11 130 kilometers (6000 n mi). For\n3620-metric-ton (4000-ton) gross weights, the nuclear aircraft reactor power density\n3\ncan be as low as 71 watts per cubic centimeter (2 MW/ft ) and show superior cost performance for ranges l e s s than 7420 kilometers (4000 n mi).\nLewis Research Center,\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration,\nCleveland, Ohio, June 25, 1971,\n- 126-15.\n\n38\n\nAPPENDIX A\nSYMBOLS\nB\n\nshield weight constant\n\nCE\n\nengine cost, dollars\n\n\xe2\x80\x98FC\n\nchemical fuel cost, dollars/@; dollars/lbm\n\nC~~\n\nnuclear fuel cost, dollars/g\n\ncR\n\nreactor cost, dollars\n\nSH\n\nshield cost, dollars\n\nST\n\nstructure cost, dollars\n\nC~~~\n\ntotal vehicle cost, dollars\n\nCkR\n\ncrew cost per operating hour, dollars/hr\n\nCk\n\nmachinery depreciation cost per operating hour, dollars/hr\n\n%N\n\nnuclear fuel cost per operating hour, dollars/hr\n\nCiNS\n\ninsurance cost per operating hour, dollars/hr\n\nCiwr\n\ninterest cost per operating hour, dollars/hr\n\nc;vr\n\nmaintenance cost per operating hour, dollars/hr\n\nCbR\n\nprofit cpst per operating hour, dollars/hr\n\nCk\n\nreactor depreciation cost per operating hour, dollars/hr\n\nCkH\n\nshield depreciation cost per operating hour, dollars/hr\n\n%T\n\nstructure depreciation cost per operating hour, dollars/hr\n\nF\n\nthrust, N lbf\n,\n\nKE\n\nspecific engine cost, dollars/@; dollars/lbm\n\nK~~~\n\ninsurance cost factor\n\nK~~~\n\ninterest cost factor\n\nKM\n\nmaintenance cost factor\n\nKPR\n\nprofit cost factor\n\nKR\n\nspecific reactor cost, dollars/MWth\n\nKSH\n\nspecific shield cost, dollars/@; dollars/lbm\n\n39\n\nKST\n\nspec ific structure cost, dollar s/kg ; dollar s/lbm\n\nL/D\n\nlift-drag ratio\n\n\'th\n\nthermal power, MW\n\nP\n\npayload factor\n\nR\n\nrange, km; n m i\n\nS\n\nfuel consumption, (kg/hr)/N; (Em/hr)/lbf\n\nTE\n\nmachinery life, hr\n\nTR\n\nreactor life, h r\n\nTSH\n\nshield life, h r\n\nTST\n\nstructure life, h r\n\nU\n\nutilization factor, yearly operating hours\n\nV\n\nspeed, km/hr; knots\n\nf\n\n8760\n\nengine weight, metric tons; tons\n\nwF\n\nfuel weight, metric tons; tons\n\nwG\n\ngross weight, metric tons; tons\n\nwPAY\n\npayload weight, metric tons; tons\n\nwR\n\nreactor weight, metric tons; tons\n\nSH\nST\nrl\n\nPP\nPR\n\n40\n\nshield weight, metric tons; tons\n\nstructure weight, metric tons; tons\noverall thermal efficient\npower density of reactor, W/cm3; MW/ft 3\nreactor average weight density, g/cm 3 ; lbm/ft 3\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nWEIGHT AND COST B\nThe complete cost breakdown is given for chemical- and nuclear-powered aircraft\nwith gross weights of 1000 and 4000 tons.
