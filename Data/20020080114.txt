b"B\n\nelow is a Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometer, an\noceanographic instrument being marketed by\nEnvironmental Monitoring Systems (EMS) division\nof MillWest Corporation, Dumas, Texas. The first commercial units were shipped in 1994 to Germany's Alfred\nWegener Institute.\nDeveloped under NASA contract, the FRR fluorometer is a computer-controlled instrument for measuring the\nfluorescence of phytoplankton, the microscopic plant\nforms that are the major sources of sustenance for animal\nlife in the oceans; such measurements provide scientific\ninformation on ocean activity and productivity. The\ninstrument measures the chlorophyll biomass (the total\namount of phytoplankton in a water sample) and the parameters of photosynthesis in phytoplankton (photosynthesis is the process by which plant cells produce\ncarbohydrates by absorbing carbon dioxide and water in\nthe presence of chlorophyll and light, and release oxygen\na s a byproduct). At right, Dr. Zbignew Kolber works\nwith data collected by the sensor, which was lowered into\nthe ocean and towed by ship through an area being simul-\n\ntaneously investigated by satellite instruments; test printouts of FRR fluorometer and satellite data are compared.\nAmong advantages cited for the Fast Repetition Rate\nFluorometer,it is non-destructive and does not harm the\nmicroplants, and it can be used in situ,eliminating the\nneed to remove a sample from its natural surroundings.\nThe instrument is equipped with a powerful microcomputer, a data logger, an internal battery pack and a flexible\ncommunications channel.\nThe fluorometer was originally designed at\nBrookhaven National Laboratory, Long Island, New York.\nDevelopment was begun in 1990 by G. Miller Machine\nCompany. Dumas, Texas, parent company of EMS. In\n1992, Jet Propulsion Laboratory awarded the company a\nNASA Small Business Innovation Research contract to\ncomplete the development. Although the fluorometer is\ntechnically commercialized, EMS is continuing work on\nthe SBIR contract, refining the electrical components and\nwriting software for incorporation in later versions of the\ninstrument.\n\n"
