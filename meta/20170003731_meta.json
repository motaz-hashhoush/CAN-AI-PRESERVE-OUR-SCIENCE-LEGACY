This paper is divided into two parts: (1) a description of the Single Particle Melting Model (SPMM), a heuristic melting simulation for ice-phase precipitation particles of any shape or size (SPMM is applied to two simulated aggregate snow particles, simulating melting up to 0.15 melt fraction by mass), and (2) the computation of the single-particle microwave scattering and extinction properties of these hydrometeors, using the discrete dipole approximation (via DDSCAT), at the following selected frequencies: 13.4, 35.6, and 94.0GHz for radar applications and 89, 165.0, and 183.31GHz for radiometer applications. These selected frequencies are consistent with current microwave remote-sensing platforms, such as CloudSat and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. Comparisons with calculations using variable-density spheres indicate significant deviations in scattering and extinction properties throughout the initial range of melting (liquid volume fractions less than 0.15). Integration of the single-particle properties over an exponential particle size distribution provides additional insight into idealized radar reflectivity and passive microwave brightness temperature sensitivity to variations in size/mass, shape, melt fraction, and particle orientation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"volume": "9", "submissionId": 20170003731, "issue": "1", "issn": "1867-1381", "publisher": "European Geosciences Union", "eissn": "1867-8548", "id": "fc40df7034d24e33b16684239adcaca4", "publicationName": "Atmospheric Measurement Techniques", "publicationDate": "2016-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170003731.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170003731/downloads/20170003731.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170003731/downloads/20170003731.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170003731/downloads/20170003731.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
