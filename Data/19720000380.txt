No refinement of current\nquality control laboratory procedures, equipment, or\noperator skills is required. The standard technique,\nhelium bombardment leak testing, is accomplished by\nsubjecting the parts to be tested to "bombing" in a\nhelium atmosphere at specified pressure for a specified\ntime period. Within some limited time following the\nhelium\n\xe2\x80\xa2 bombardment the parts are examined with a\nmass spectrometer leak detector to determine the rate\nat which helium gas, forced into the part during bombardment, is leaking back out through the seals. Parts which\nexhibit post-bombardment helium leak rates greater than\na specified criterion limit are rejected.\nIn the new method, at least two post-bombardment\nleak rate measurements are made, and the acceptance/\nrejection decision is based upon the rate at which the\nmeasured leak rate decays, rather than upon leak rate\nmagnitude. The new method stems from an analysis of\ngas flow into and out of the sealed volume which is rigorously correct only for the laws of exponential decay\nwhich apply to molecular permeation, or gaseous diffusion flow. The method is conservative, however, in its\ndeterminations of seal quality for those parts which,\nwhile having seals capable of permitting viscous flow,\nyet have hermetic requirements determined by prolonged\natmospheric storage periods during which gas transport\nthrough viscous flow is negligible.\nThe new technique provides a more precise and repeatable measure of seal quality and reduces or eliminates\nthe requirement for precisely controlled tracer gas bom-\n\nbardment pressures and durations. It eases the tight\ntime constraint on leak rate measurement following\nbombardment, and reduces error arising from externally\nadsorbed tracer gas.\nThe technique eliminates errors in seal quality determinations resulting from absolute error in the reference\nleak standard and also from previous tracer gas fills\nintroduced either in manufacturing or during previous\nbombardment. The method is excellent for performing\nprecise leak tests or for checking the quality of hermetic seals.\t\nNotes:\n1. Information concerning this innovation may be of\ninterest to seal manufacturers and of substantial\ninterest to all industry in general.\n2.
