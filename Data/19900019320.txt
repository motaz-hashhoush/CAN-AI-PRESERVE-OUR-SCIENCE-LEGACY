Recovery and refurbishment of SRB\'s\nhave resulted in expensive "crash and salvage" operations.\nVehicle system designers are encouraged to be acutely aware of these cost drivers and to\nincorporate solutions -- beginning with the design concepts -- to avoid "business as usual" and\n"costs as usual".\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nCOST\n\nDRIVERS\n\nFor several decades, the Free World launch vehicles have been designed for _,\nwith\nvery little attention given to considerations for _UDDOrtability and/or maintainability.\nAs a result,\nrecurring cost of operations over the lite of a program has been an inordinately large contibutor to\nLife Cycle Costs (LCC) - see Figure 1.\n\n414\n\nLife Cycle\nFigure\n\nCosts\nI\n\n&\nDEVELOPMENT \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\n73%\n\nOPERATIONS \xe2\x80\xa2"\ni\n\n*\n\nMANUFACTURING\nR& D\nOPERATIONS\n\n1.65 B$ (1965) escalated using NASA Headquarters\n\nfactor of 4.199 for 1965 - 1985\n\n** 2189.4 M$ (1985) - Data supplied by NASA to the Congressional\n\nBudget Office\n\nExtrapolation of current operational costs (using actuals from the 8 FY85 Space Shuttle Program\nlaunches) indicates that total Operations Costs exceeded 73% of the LCC, whereas Design and\nManufacturing\nwere approximately 27%. This exorbitant Operations cost drives the LCC for one\n100-flight Orbiter to $33.9 billion (in \'85 dollars). Our best performance for the fleet of four orbiters\nto date is the 8 launches in FY 85. The cost per pound to LEO exceeded $5,000! Obviously, in\nfuture worldwide price competition, the "business as usual" approach for our Space Program will be\nsuicidal and must be changed.\nFigure 2 describes the elements that contribute to LCC, and here we see that the process starts\nwith development of the Request for Proposal (RFP). Traditionally, the RFP is overburdened with\nminute specifications. Many of these are necessary -- but are they looked at in light of what costs\nthey impose on the program vs the _\nthey provide? The RFP usually describes, in great\ndetail, "how to do it"; whereas the RFP should be primarily devoted to a generic description of the\nproduct. Between the RFP and the delivered product, there are many contributors to Operations\ncosts. This discussion will address various "engine system" contributions to those operational\nCOSTS.\n\nFortunately, opportunity exists today to significantly improve the process of considering system\nsupportability requirements while designing a system that meets performance criteria. To make the\nmost of these opportunities requires two major changes in our way of doing business:\n(1) Change the "mind set" of all of us in the space program to make (or accept) compromises\nin performance if they contribute to a reduction in LCC.\n(2)\n\nProvide more effort (dollars) upfront in the early design phase to provide for operational\nefficiencies -- suoDortable and maintainable, robust systems.\n\n415\n\nCost\n\nContributors\nFigure\n\neMkJOR\n\nIMPACT\n\nFACTORS\n\n2\n\n|\n\n/\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 _O..SrRA_ON\n_\n\n_\n\nOperations\n\nCosts\n\nMANAGEMENT\n//(B OTHER\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n/\n\n/\n\nI\n\nIMPACT\n\nC4.16"TOMER/U_ER\n\nFACTORS\n\nPROCESSING\n\n/\n\nI "_\xc2\xb0_""_\n\n,\n\n/\n\nREOMI\'S\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 _o_co_s\n\n;\n\n/\n\n_\n\nI\n\nTIME\n\n_\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n____ ....\n\nI\n\nco.\n\nI\n_\nMANAGEMENT\nI\n\nCONTRACTOR\n\nI\n\nI\nj\n\n-I\nI\n\nSYSTEMS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n*TEGRAT,ON\n\n!/\'_\'II\n\nI\n\nC\xc2\xb0ST I\n\n)\n\n_o\n\n\\\n\n_\n\nTo\n\no_o.\n\n_\'_\n\n)--_4\n\n--_.--\n\n[\n\n_\n\nI\n\n*OTNER\xc2\xa2OST\n,.CTO.I.\n\nFACILITIES\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCONTRACT\n\nRESEARCHDE\nD T \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_FUGt_rTOPF_RA_ON_S\nNE.r_VOR_ _U_pORT\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nB\n\n.I\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nI\n\nI\n\nTO\n\nI\nI\n\n=c\n\nI\n\ni\n\nADMINISTRATION\n\nand\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nI\n\nLIFEcosTsCYCLE\n\n1\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nAs noted earlier,\n\noperations\n\ncosts constitute\n\n73% of LCC,\n\n(see Figure\n\n3).\n\nThe original goal for shuttle turnaround was 160 hours. However, it soon became apparent that 160\nhours\nwas not achievable\nwith the hardware\ndesigned\nand built within Congressional\nbudget and\nManagement\nschedule\nconstraints.\nPrior to 51-L, the goal of 680 hours had been established\nby\nKSC as the "shortest processing\ntime that KSC could achieve".\nWhile this was much greater than the\noriginal\n"spec value", it was\na justifiable\ngoal considering\nthe best composite\nprocessing\ntime\nachieved (1040 hours)\nconsisted\nof 624 hours in the OPF by STS 8, 96 hours in the VAB by 41-C,\nand 320 hours\non the Pad by 51-G!\nThis "best\ncomposite"\nconsiders\nthe 25 vehicle\nprocessing/launch\noperations\nof the Shuttle Program to date.\nDue to the very significant changes as a result of 51-L,\nprocessing\ntime at the end of the second\noperational\nyear (in the 1990-93 time period) is projected\nto be1992 hours for each of the four Shuttle\nvehicles.\nSubsequently,\nthe flow is projected to decrease\nto 1704 hours after the end of the fourth\noperational\nyear and is then expected to level off at that figure. Obviously,\nthe Shuttle,\nnot designed\nfor supportability\nand maintainability,\nwill require a very significant\namount of additional\nprocessing\nactivities tor the forseeable\nfuture.\n\n416\n\nShuttle\n\nGround\n\nLife Cycle\n\nOperations\nCosts\n\n(Pre\n\nFigure\n\nP_OCTE0\n\nProcessing\n/ Post\n\n51-L)\n\n3\n\nKOW\n\nIECO_ D\nJU_*I**O\n\n}\n\n/\n\nSHUTTLE\nPAD\n\nPROCESSING\n\nTIME\nI*I-L TOTAL\n\nCOMPARISONS\n\n1_0\n\n1040 HWS\n_ST\n\nCOv_sn_\n\n,:.:,_\n\nPA_\n\n_WCrS\n2_ _\n\n_/3\ni/3\n\n14.\nSO\'*\n\n_s_4\n\n7--\n\n\'\n\n\xc2\xa2.\n\nV_\n\n_i:\n\ni!ii_\n,g\n\ni\n\n_\n$14.\n\nTOTAL\n\nII_SO - lot3\n\n1002 - tlPI)G\n\nOF\n417\n\nPOOR\n\nQUALITY\n\nWhat can be done? Each of the design disciplines, including propulsion, can develop many cost\neffective solutions which will contribute to the required reduction in LCC.\nThe following are some criteria for the propulsion system (engines, propellants, propellant supply,\ntankage, pressurization, TVC, etc.) that can provide a significant reduction to the propulsion\ncontribution to operational costs of a Program. The basic objective is to _,\n_I_DJJIY.,and/or\neliminate functions or components. While a system may be very complex internally, the interlaces that\nit presents for launch servicing and support should be as simple as possible. The less care, handling,\nand support required at the launch site, the smaller the number of support people, equipment (GSE),\nand/or facilities will be required. Only in this fashion can over-all launch costs be reduced. Not just the\nvehicle must be simplified, the total infrastructure, and the requirements for vehicle processing\noperation, must be evaluated and minimized as well.\n\nSIMPLIFIED\n\nLAUNCH\n\nSYSTEM\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nCRITERIA\n\nPropulsion\n\nINTEGRATED PROPULSION SYSTEM\nSimplified\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nrobust\n\npropulsion\n\nsystem\n\nFully throttleable\nengines\nSoft engine start\nTVC by delta thrust and/or\nOne oxidizer / one fuel\n\n(multi-phase)\nRCS / or aero\n\nELIMINATE\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\n\nSeparate OMS and RCS\nHigh maintenance turbopumps\nHydraulics\nHypergols\nGNo/He\non-board purges\nGNU/He\npressure systems\nGimballed engines\nExtensive recovery &\nrefurbishment\n\nSelected topics from the above list will be addressed in the following discussions.\n\n418\n\nSimplified\n\nRobust\n\nPropulsion\n\nSystem\n\nOperations\nSolution:\nSimplified, integrated, robust propulsion system that, using the same oxidizer and\nfuel, provides the essential elements of:\nMain Propulsion\nOrbit Insertion / deorbit\nAttitude / Rendezvous Control\nRationale:\nCurrent propulsion systems started with an engine design,\nvehicle built around it.\n\nwith the MPS\n\nand\n\nThere is a necessity to simplify and integrate all propulsion systems to\nminimize the ground operations and maintenance.\n\nOne\n\nOxidizer\n\n/ One\n\nFuel\n\nOperations\nSolution:\nDesign vehicles using only one oxidizer and one fuel; simplifying propellant\nprocurement, transport, storage, pumping, safety equipment and procedures, and\nheadcount.\n\nRationale:\nEach individual propellant ground system requires expensive, hazardous facilities /\nGSE, and its own little army of engineers, technicians, and safety.\nSTS has five propellant components, each of which require separate procurement,\ntransport, storage, pumping, GSE, safety, operational procedures, engineers,\ntechnicians, etc.\n\nEliminate\n\nSeDarate\n\nOMS\n\nand\n\nRCS\n\nOperations\nSolution:\nDelete OMS and RCS as separate systems from MPS.\nRationale:\nIf MPS can be utilized as the hot gas source for OMS and RCS, it may significantly\nlighten vehicle and will simplify ground support operations.\n\n419\n\nEliminate\n\nHiqh-Malntenance\n\nTurbo\n\nDUm_DS\n\nOperations\nSolution:\nThe ideal solution is to _\nhigh maintenance turbopumps. If turbopumps\nremain in the system, they must be made more robust to reduce refurbishment and\nmaintenance requirements for recoverable stages.\nRationale:\nTurbopumps are costly to develop and manufacture, heavy, run at very high RPM\nand pressures, and are cavitation-sensitive.\nRocket engine cost, refurbishment frequency, refurbishment\ncheckout time are largely driven by turbopump sensitivity.\n\ncost, and test &\n\nPressure-fed engines with plug nozzles are a viable prospect as specific impulse is\nrelatively insensitive to chamber pressure p.P,j..,_. Chamber pressures on the order\nof 200 psia should be investigated to lighten the tank structure and pressurization\nsystem. Multiple clustered stages may be necessary to achieve the required\nbase/nozzle exit area.\n\nNo\n\nHvdraulics\n\nOperations\nSolution:\nProvide high thrust actuators for vehicle systems using some system other than\nhydraulic.\nRationale:\nHydraulic systems are heavy, complex, and plagued with O&M and GSE activities.\nThey require extensive facility hydraulic systems to provide a source of hydraulic\npower for ground checkout of flight systems, and a separate little army of\nengineer-specialists, technicians, etc.\n\nNo\n\nHyDerqols\n\nOperations\nSolution:\nAvoid use of hypergols for launch, orbital propulsion, or APU systems.\nRationale:\nA very significant quantity of non-productive manhours occurs during each flow for\nthe "area clear" required during hazardous "opening\', entry, or operation of orbiter\nOMS and RCS systems. There is a snowballing effect in facilities and O&M\nrequirements for special ventilation, scrubbers and a multitude of safety equipment,\nincluding a small army specially trained to do their job in SCAPE (self-contained\natmospheric protective ensemble) suits. Further, a pound of hypergol costs about\n$8, whereas, a LOX/H 2 mix costs less than $0.22/Ib; a LOX/CH 4 mix costs less\nthan $0.15/Ib; and a LOX/C3H 8 costs less than $0.08/Ib.\n\n420\n\nNO GN2/HQ\n\nOn-board\n\nPuraes\n\nOperations\nSolution:\nDelete launch vehicle on-board GN 2 and He purge systems.\nRationale:\nSubject systems add weight to vehicle and the associated electro / mechanical /\npneumatic subsystems require special small O&M army and much time for ground\nprocessing and launch.\nElimination of GN2 and HE storage bottles, supply valves, manifolds, plumbing, and\nmultiple test and checkout, will significantly lighten the vehicle, and simplify and\nspeed-up ground support operations.\n\nNO\n\nGimballed\n\nEnaines\n\nOperations\nSolution:\nDevise thrust vector or vehicle attitude control systems which eliminate need for\ngimballed engines and associated hydraulics, seals, pivots, bellows, etc.\nRationale:\nGimballed systems are expensive, heavy, and add a severe burden of O&M, and test\nand checkout to ground support operations.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA direct frontal attack on Life Cycle Cost reduction is of prime importance to realize the potential of any\nconceptual future launch system.\nThe propulsion community is laced with a major challenge in reducing Life Cycle Costs. As engineers\nand managers, we are prone to look for the "elegant solution". For instance, a turbopump designer is\nalways looking for that additional few feet of head rise while reducing the weight.\nIt will require a major change in "mind set" by everyone to back-off on performance requirements,\nthereby seeking the goal of significantly reduced ground support operations. Compromising with the\n"elegant solution" holds the promise of acquiring a launch system that can do the required job, is\nrelatively cheap to operate, requires very little inspection / test, and provides a robust long useful life.\nIf we are to be successful in the future, the battle cry must be :\n\nDESIGN THE SUPPORT\nnot\nSupport the Design H\n\n421\n\n'
