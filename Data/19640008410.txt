Then, by varying the launch date and the time out, the\ntrajectories with a minimum propulsive velocity increment\nwere located. The trajectory data were generated by the\n"patch-conic, impulsive AV" computer program of Ref. 1.\nwhich accounts for both the eccentririty and the inclinations\nof the Earth and the Mars orbitq.\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe minimum propulsive velocity increment for each miasion time, AV, in miles per second is plotted against the\nmission time in days for launch years of 1971 and 1980 in\nFigs. 3 and 4, respectively. In all cases, the mission starts\nfrom an Earth parking orbit of 1.1 Earth radii, and atmospheric braking is used at Earth return. The lowest\nperiapsis of the Mars pass considered for the gravity and the\npropulsive-gravity-turn trajectories is 1.1 Mars radii. For\nreferences, the total AT\' required for a comparable direct\nlunar landing and return mission (5.3 mps) and the minimum\nAV for a one-way fly-by transfer to Mars (about 2.2 mps) are\nindicated on the ordinate.\nMany of the Mars round trips require a AV substantially\nless than that for the lunar landing. The Mars trip times,\nhowever, are considerably longer than the lunar trip time,\nwhich is of the order of a week.\nGravity-turn trajectories are possible only a t total trip\ntimes of approximately I year and again at trip times greater\nthan about 18 years. If 1980 is the launch year, the lowest\nAV for a gravity turn occurs for a trip time of 540 days.\nBy admitting the use of thrusting near Mars, the propulsivegravity-turn type of trajectory, round trips become possible\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nTRANSFER\n\nI\n\nI\n\nLL\nd\n\nI\n\n420\n460\n500\nTOTAL TRIP TIME, DAYS\n\n540\n\n580\n\nFig. 3 Round-trip nonstop missions in 1971.\n\nF\n\nvelocity vector is turned through an angle @a by the vehicle\nlift and is also decreased in magnitude because of aerodynamic\ndrag.

For 1980, the minimum AT\' is\nslightly less than that for the best gravity turn and occurs at a\nshorter trip time, about 500 days. Also, in both 1971 and\n1980, there is only a slow increase in A V wit\'h decreasing trip\ntime for trip times down to about 400 days.\nEven further reductions in AV occur when an aerodynamic\nturn is used at Mars. Values only slightly greater than that\nfor a one-way transfer occur for a vehicle with a liftdrag ratio\nof 4. Significant reductions in AV below that for the propulsive-gravity turn exist also for the more practical lift-drag\nvalues of 1.5 and 2.0. The trip times for low AV are between\nabout 380 and 420 days for this case.\nThe effect of launch year on the required AV may be seen\nby comparing the values in Figs. 3 and 4. For the gravit?\nand the propulsive-gravity turns, the values of AV are greater\nin 1980 than in 1971. This effect is due to the eccentricity of\nthe MEUS\norbit. The trips in 1971 pass Mars when Mars is\nnear its perihelion, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The trips in 1980,\nhowever, pass Mars when Mars is near its aphelion. A comparison of the atmospheric turns in 1971 and 1980 shows that\nthe required propulsive velocity increment for this type of\ntrajectory is least sensitive to the launch year.\nSeveral factors not discussed in this note are also important\nin the case of atmospheric turns: g loads, heat loads, and\nfeasible lift-drag ratios. In most cases, the g loads during the\natmospheric turns are less than 10 Earth g\'s, which is about\nthe limit of human tolerance. The vehicle must be capable of\nabsorbing both the heat load associated with the aerodynamic\nturn at Mars and the Earth atmospheric entry. The lowest\nAV available will depend on the practically realizable liftdrag ratios, which may be of the order of 2.0. The heat loads\nalso depend on the vehicle lift-drag ratio. The atmosphericturn trajectories pose challenging but not unfeasible aerodynamic and heat-protection problems, which require further\nstudy.\nConclusions\n\nThe following conclusions can be drawn from the present\nstudy of Mars nonstop round-trip trajectories using gravity,\npropulsive-gravity, and atmospheric turns a t Mars :\n1) When compared with gravity turns, the use of small\namounts of propulsion near Mars markedly expands the range\n"\n\nLIFT-DRAG\n\nRATIO\n\nt\n\n\\.--/. 1 -----\n\nGRAVITY\nPROPULSIVE-GRAVITY\nATMOSPHERIC\n\nI\n\nFig. 2 Types of nonstop round-trip trajectories: a) gravity turn and propulsive-gravity turn; b) atmospheric\n\n%E FILE COPY\n!\n\n340\n\n380\n\n~\n\n1-\n\n420\n460\n500\nTOTAL TRIP TIME, DAYS\n\nI\n\nI\n\n540\n\nI~\n\n1-\n\n580\n\nFig. 4 Round-trip nonstop missions in 1980.\n\nAIAA JOURNAL\n\nc\n\nVOL. 2, NO. 2\n\no possible trip times and in some\nf\npropulsive velocity increment.\n$ The use of an atmospheric turn at Mar an reduce the\nrequired propulsive velocity increment to a va ue approaching\nthat for a one-way transfer to Mars, depending on the feasible\nvehicle lift-drag ratios.
