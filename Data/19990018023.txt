Four USMP-4 science\nexperiments were installed on two carriers in the cargo\nbay of the Shuttle. The Confined Helium Experiment\n(CHeX), located on the aft carrier, was particularly\nsusceptible to vibrations in several frequency ranges due\nto structural resonances of the CHeX apparatus and the\nextreme sensitivity of the sample to vibrations. Shortly\nafter activation of the USMP-4 payload, a strong\nvibratory disturbance within the susceptibility region of\nthe CHeX apparatus was detected. After investigating\nthe characteristics of the disturbance and the time at\nwhich it first appeared, it was deduced that the vibration\nwas generated by cooling fans in the Isothermal\nDendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE). This paper will\nsummarize the development of the conflict, briefly\ndescribe the disturbance source, and the susceptibility of\nthe CHeX apparatus, and summarize the results of postmission tests of IDGE.\n\nACRONYMS & ABBREVIATIONS\nCHeX\ng\nIDGE\nISS\nJPL\n\xc2\xb5g\nmg\n\nConfined Helium Experiment\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity level (nominally 9.81 m/s2)\nIsothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment\nInternational Space Station\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n10-6times nominal Earth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity level\n10-3times nominal Earth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity level\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa91999 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and\nAstronautics, Inc.

With the free-fall\nconditions of an orbiting spacecraft, apparent\nweightlessness is achieved allowing more subtle effects\nto be observed, such as the surface tension of liquids,\nsolidification of materials without buoyant settling, and\nconvection-free combustion.\nThe effects of gravity are seen in Earth-bound\nlaboratories due to restraining forces exerted by\ncontainers, such as ampoules, test tubes, or anything that\nstops a sample from falling. In a condition of free fall, the\nsample and associated containers do not have a relative\nforce between them since they are both experiencing the\nsame acceleration. A drop tower attains this free fall\ncondition by vertically dropping an experiment sample\nin a carriage. An aircraft accomplishes a free fall by\nflying a parabolic trajectory. An Earth-orbiting vehicle\nattains this free fall condition by balancing the\ngravitational attraction with a centripetal acceleration\nobtained by a circular (or nearly circular) orbit. Using\nthese three methods of achieving reduced gravity\nconditions, scientists have conducted numerous\nexperiments to investigate basic phenomena which are\nunobservable in the presence of the normal gravitational\nforces.\n\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAIAA-99-0576\nGravity is not the only acceleration that disturbs\nexperiments on the ground. Ground-based laboratories\nhave other vibrational disturbances such as elevators, air\nconditioners, earthquakes, and actions of people. In a\nsimilar way, the microgravity environment of the Shuttle\nhas vibrational disturbances, such as pumps, machines,\nfans, and crew motions.\n\nFOURTH UNITED STATES\nMICROGRAVITY PAYLOAD\nThe STS-87 Shuttle mission from 19 November\n1997 to 5 December 1997 carried the Fourth United\nStates Microgravity Payload (USMP-4) as one of the\nprimary payloads. Four USMP-4 science experiments\nwere installed on two Mission Peculiar Equipment\nSupport Structure (MPESS) carriers in the cargo bay of\nthe Shuttle as shown in Figure 1. The Advanced\nAutomated Directional Solidification Furnace and the\nFrench-built furnace MEPHISTO were mounted on the\nforward MPESS carrier. The Confined Helium\nExperiment (CHeX) and Isothermal Dendritic Growth\nExperiment (IDGE) were mounted on the aft carrier.\nTwo Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS)\nunits were included in the USMP-4 complement, one\nmounted on each of the two MPESS carriers.\nSpace Acceleration Measurement System\nThe SAMS units measured the microgravity\nacceleration environment during the on-orbit operations\nof USMP-4 to record and characterize the conditions\nunder which the experiments were operated.1 The\nPrincipal Investigator Microgravity Services (PIMS)\nproject team monitored the SAMS data available in realtime during the mission and provided interpretation of\nthe microgravity environment to the Principal\nInvestigator (PI) teams, mission cadre, and other mission\nparticipants.\nA SAMS unit is comprised of up to three remote\ntriaxial acceleration sensor heads and a main unit which\ncontrols the system, records the data, and makes the data\navailable to be transmitted to operations facilities on the\nground. Each of the remote sensor heads may be\nconfigured with a low-pass filter so as to measure the\naccelerations in the frequency band of interest to the\nexperiment supported by that sensor head. The standard\n\nfilter cutoff frequencies available are 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50,\nand 100 Hz. Once configured for a Shuttle mission, these\nfrequencies are fixed for that mission.\nConfined Helium Experiment\nThe Confined Helium Experiment (CHeX)2, 3\nmade\nspecific heat measurements on a sample of liquid helium\nas the sample was heated through its superfluid/fluid\ntransition. The sample was confined to a twodimensional state by silicon plates.\nLaboratory experiments to date have yielded\ninconclusive results about theories of the behavior of\nconfined matter. CHEX made use of high-resolution\nthermometers and the microgravity environment of the\nspace shuttle to investigate theoretical predictions with\naccuracy impossible in ground-based experiments.\nThe core of the experiment is a cylindrical copper\ncalorimeter containing a liquid helium sample. The\nsample is confined in a two-dimensional state by a stack\nof 408 parallel silicon wafers. The confined sample is\ncontained in 50 micrometer gaps between the 50\nmicrometer thick wafers. Heat capacity is measured in a\nstep-wise fashion by injecting heat into the sample and\nmeasuring the resultant temperature change using\nthermometers with temperature resolution on the order\nof nano-Kelvins. The temperature was approximately 2\nKelvin and the energy input into the sample for each step\nwas measured in pico-watts.\nAccurate thermal control of the calorimeter is\nprovided by an apparatus developed for the Lambda\nPoint Experiment, a previous microgravity experiment.\nThe thermal control apparatus, including the calorimeter,\nis housed in a cryogenic dewar mounted on the MPESS\ncarrier in the Shuttle payload bay.\nDue to the sample temperature sensitivity to small\nenergy changes, the structural susceptibility to vibrations\nwas measured in a series of tests. The test results showed\nthat CHeX was particularly susceptible to vibrations in\nseveral frequency ranges due to structural resonances of\nthe CHeX apparatus, with one such region centered at\n55 Hz. As a result, concern was expressed prior to the\nmission regarding the magnitude of the third harmonic at\n51 Hz of the Shuttle antenna vibration at 17 Hz. Tests to\ninvestigate the possible effects from the Ku-band\nantenna were planned for early in the mission.\n\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAIAA-99-0576\nIsothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment\nThe IDGE scientific objective is to test fundamental\nassumptions concerning dendritic solidification of\nmolten materials.3, 4 Dendrites are tiny branching\nstructures that form inside molten metal alloys when they\nsolidify. The size, shape, and orientation of the dendrites\nhave a major effect on the strength, ductility, and\nusefulness of an alloy. Ultimately, information from\nIDGE may result in improved industrial manufacturing\nof steel, aluminum, superalloys, and other metals that are\nused on Earth every day.\nThe basic IDGE apparatus consists of a thermostat\ncontaining a growth chamber, cameras, two slow-scan\ntelevisions, an active internal temperature control\nsystem, and computer systems. Air fans are used for\ncooling electronics subassemblies and for ensuring\nuniformity in the sample temperature. IDGE was flown\non USMP-2, USMP-3, and USMP-4.\n\nEXPERIMENT-TO-EXPERIMENT\nDISTURBANCE\nThe Problem\nDue to the known CHeX susceptibility to vibrations\naround 55 Hz, tests were planned early in the STS-87\nmission to investigate the effect of the Ku band antenna\ndither frequency. Early in the mission, though, a stronger\ndisturbance was noticed primarily around 56 Hertz\nwhich was within the susceptibility region of the CHeX\napparatus. This disturbance first appeared about Mission\nElapsed Time (MET) 000/03:25 as shown in Figure 2.\nThe CHeX PI requested that the source of the\ndisturbance be identified with the possibility that it be\ndisabled during critical CHeX operations.\nThe Investigation\nThe unexpected 56 Hz vibrations were first noticed\nusing real-time acceleration data downlinked from\nSAMS. Analyses of the SAMS data were conducted by\nthe PIMS project team over several days to characterize\nthis disturbance according to the expressed needs of the\nCHeX PI. The CHeX team needed to assess the impact\nof these vibrations on their operations. In order to\ndevelop a compensation or mitigation method, the CHeX\nPI needed the frequency and magnitude characteristics of\n\nthe disturbance. A series of data plots was requested by\nthe CHeX PI so the frequency spread and magnitude\nvariation of the disturbance could be examined.\nA typical power spectral density (PSD) plot with\nhigh frequency resolution representative of the set\nprepared for the CHeX PI is shown in Figure 3. The\nstrength of this disturbance may be seen from the\nmagnitude height of the peaks around 56 Hz and the\nfrequency width of the disturbance, especially compared\nwith the signal from the third harmonic of the Ku-band\nantenna dither frequency. The result of the\ncharacterization of this disturbance was that the\nvibrations in the 56 Hertz region were a combination of\nseveral sources at slightly different frequencies, with\neach source at a relatively constant frequency and\nmagnitude. The mission scientist consulted with the\nvarious experiment teams, Spacelab support staff, and\nOrbiter subsystem personnel to ascertain the source of\nthese disturbances.\nAfter investigating the characteristics of the\n56 Hertz disturbance and, in particular, the time at which\nit first appeared, the PIMS team deduced that the\nvibration may have been introduced by the IDGE\napparatus. In discussions with IDGE personnel, it was\nfound that within the IDGE apparatus there were six\ncooling fans and a fan whose speed was controlled by a\nmeasured internal IDGE temperature.\nThe generation of vibrations at these frequencies by\nthe IDGE apparatus was not noticed in SAMS data from\nthe USMP-2 and USMP-3 payloads because lower\nfrequency sensor heads were utilized for those missions.\nLower frequency SAMS sensor heads were chosen\nbecause the experiments on those missions (including\nIDGE) were susceptible only to lower frequency\ndisturbances. Data plots were prepared from SAMS data\nfrom USMP-2 and USMP-3 but were rather inconclusive\ndue to the severe attenuation at the higher frequencies.\nDuring testing at NASA Kennedy Space Center,\nCHeX had observed an effect to their experiment from\nboth SAMS and IDGE. To confirm that SAMS was not\ncontributing to the 56 Hz disturbance, one of the SAMS\nunits was turned off for several minutes during USMP-4.\nNo significant effect was found from this de-activation\nof SAMS. It was decided that the IDGE would not be\n\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAIAA-99-0576\nturned off due to the risks to IDGE science operations if\nthere were problems with re-activating IDGE.\n\nIDGE temperature-controlled fan. These post-mission\ntest characteristics match well with the observed\ncharacteristics of the disturbances during the mission.\n\nThe Resolution\nThe resolution of the potential problem during the\nmission was for CHeX to compensate their data for this\n56 Hz disturbance. Compensation was possible in part\ndue to the constant frequency and reasonably constant\namplitude nature of the disturbance. If the disturbance\nhad been of a variable frequency or variable magnitude,\nthe compensation would have been more difficult, if not\nimpossible. That situation may have resulted in major\nconflict of operations between IDGE and CHeX.\nEnd-of-mission Test\nIn an effort to gain final confirmation of the source\nof the 56 Hz disturbances, the deactivation of the USMP4 experiments was conducted sequentially with call\ndowns from the crew as to the times of each step. The\nSAMS data around the IDGE deactivation time on MET\nday 015 are shown as a spectrogram in Figure 4. In\naddition to the 56 Hz traces, the variable trace between\n35 and 40 Hz, and a 74 Hz disturbance cease at the time\nof the IDGE power-off at about MET 015/09:47.\nPost-mission Tests\nAfter the experiments were de-integrated from the\ncarriers at the end of the mission, a test was performed at\nLeRC with the SAMS flight instrument and the IDGE\nflight apparatus. The intent of this test was to confirm or\ndisprove the deduction formed during the mission that\nthe IDGE apparatus was responsible for these vibrations.\nThe SAMS data for this ground test are shown as a\nspectrogram in Figure 5 with the major activities\nindicated. The fans causing the disturbance around\n56 Hz begin operation as soon as IDGE power is turned\non at about 8 minutes and turn off when the IDGE power\nis turned off at about 90 minutes. Notice that the\nfrequency varies slightly when the fans first begin, but\nthen the frequency remains essentially stable. The 74 Hz\ndisturbance turns on and off with the IDGE computer\npower on and off. The source of the variable frequency\ndisturbance at around 80 Hz is unknown. The variable\nfrequency disturbance between 30 and 50 Hz appears to\nbe related (as suspected during the mission) with the\n\nLESSONS LEARNED\nAND RE-EMPHASIZED\nAnalysis and test of an experiment\xe2\x80\x99s susceptibility\nto vibrations is important when the experiment is being\ndesigned and constructed. In this case, the CHeX team\nwas prepared at the beginning of their operations to\nexamine the microgravity acceleration environment to\ndetermine if it met their requirements.\nIn mission planning, adjacent or nearby experiments\nneed to critically examine their \xe2\x80\x98neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 for possible\nsources of vibrations that may be disturbances. CHeX\nmade measurements during ground testing at NASA\nKennedy Space Center to ascertain the effect of SAMS\nand IDGE on their operations.\nAcceleration measurements need to be made with\nbandwidth that includes the susceptibility regions of an\nexperiment. The disturbance around 56 Hz was not\napparent in the SAMS data from two previous missions\nbecause lower frequency sensor heads were used in those\nmissions. Even by examining that data processed out to\nthe Nyquist frequency, the disturbance was not apparent.\nMeasurement with a sensor head of sufficient bandwidth\non USMP-4 made the disturbance very clear.\nThe acceleration environment data needs to be\nexamined as soon as it is available even if the experiment\nappears to be operating satisfactorily. The CHeX data\nfrom USMP-4 appeared nominal during initial\noperations, but the disturbance was noticed in the SAMS\ndata. There would have been serious impact on the\nCHeX data if the disturbance had been unnoticed and the\nmagnitude and/or frequency had not stayed steady.\nIt should be noted that there were no vibration limit\nrequirements imposed by NASA Johnson Space Center\non the USMP-4 payload nor by the USMP-4 payload on\nthe individual experiments. Thus, in this situation, there\nwas no experiment at fault. Rather it was fortunate that\nthe acceleration data was available in real-time, the\nproblem was recognized, and a resolution was obtained\nearly in the mission.\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAIAA-99-0576\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis experiment-to-experiment disturbance episode\nillustrates a potential problem for microgravity science\nexperiment operations on the International Space\nStation. In the design of the experiment, the hardware\ndesign team must consider not only vibrations caused by\nthe experiment itself and by the vehicle, but must also\nconsider vibrations caused by other experiments.\nA PI\xe2\x80\x99s familiarity with the microgravity\nenvironment, their experiment\xe2\x80\x99s susceptibility, and\nvibration isolation systems may help to alleviate some of\nthe problems of experiment-to-experiment disturbances.\nThe PI team must assess the susceptibility of their\nexperiment to accelerations, considering steady, slowly\nvarying, oscillatory, and transient accelerations.\nAppropriate measures should then be taken for the\nmeasurement of the environment during the experiment\noperations. The environment should be examined as\nsoon as practical relative to the experiment operations\nand data analysis.\n\nwe dealt before the mission, during the mission and after\nthe mission.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)\n\nThe STS-87 Shuttle mission carried the Fourth United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-4) as one of the primary\npayloads. Four USMP-4 science experiments were installed on two carriers in the cargo bay of the Shuttle. The Confined\nHelium Experiment (CHeX), located on the aft carrier, was particularly susceptible to vibrations in several frequency\nranges due to structural resonances of the CHeX apparatus and the extreme sensitivity of the sample to vibrations. Shortly\nafter activation of the USMP-4 payload, a strong vibratory disturbance within the susceptibility region of the CHeX\napparatus was detected. After investigating the characteristics of the disturbance and the time at which it first appeared, it\nwas deduced that the vibration was generated by cooling fans in the Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE).\nThis paper will summarize the development of the conflict, briefly describe the disturbance source, and the susceptibility\nof the CHeX apparatus, and summarize the results of post-mission tests of IDGE.\n\n14.
