However, the private\nsector is free to ultimately\nselect the operational\nRLV\nconfiguration\nto be flown in the post-2000\ntime frame.\nThe RLV Technology\nprogram has several major\nelements that together support its objectives.

Re-\n\nThe first flight of the DC-XA took place on May 20.\n1996 at White Sands, New Mexico. The flight lasted one\nminute with a climb to 800 feet, a translation\nof 350 feet\n\nand descent\na\n\nto a prepared\n\nlanding\n\npad. This marked\n\nthe\n\nfirst flight test of a composite\nliquid hydrogen tank on a\nrocket. On June 7, the DC-XA was renamed the "Clipper Graham" in honor of the late Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham who championed\nthe promise of fully reusable\nsingle-stage-to-orbit\nlaunch vehicles. On the same day,\nthe Clipper Graham\nflew a successful\n63-second\ntest\nflight. Just 26 hours later, on June 8, the rocket successfully flew a 142-second\nflight reaching an altitude of\n10,300 feet and landing on a concrete pad 350-ft from its\nlaunch pad. This rapid reflight fulfilled\nnal objectives of the DC-X program.\n\none of the origi-\n\nvehicle. An incident investigation\nboard was convened\nin early August, 1996 to determine\nthe cause of the accident with a final report due in within two months.\nAlthough the DC-XA program ended prematurely,\na number of key technologies\nfor reusable launch vehicles were successfully\nflight tested and rapid vehicle\nturnaround was demonstrated.\nWhile these flights highlight the value of X-vehicles in a development\nprogram,\nthey also suggest the reliability challenge that exists for\nfuture demonstrators\nand full-scale operational\nvehicles.\nX -33\n\nOn July 29, 1996 the Clipper Graham rocket flew a\n140-second fourth test flight reaching an altitude of 4,100\nfeet. Traveling laterally, the rocket pitched its nose up to\n60 degrees back and forth along the flight path to demonstrate maneuvers\nsuch a vehicle would need to make\nupon reentry. During the vertical landing phase, however, one of the four landing gear failed to deploy. Without support of the fourth gear, the vehicle tipped over\nafter landing, as shown in figure 4, and both of the propellant\n\ntanks\n\nruptured\n\nwith fire destroying\n\nmost of the\n\nThe objective of the X-33 NASA Cooperative Agreement Notice issued in January\n1995 was "to stimulate\nthe joint industry/Government\nfunded concept definition/\ndesign of a technology\ndemonstrator\nvehicle, the X-33,\nfollowed by the design/demonstration\nof competitively\nselected concept(s)."\nThe three phases of the program\nleading to an operational\nRLV are shown in Figure 5.\nCalendarYears\n\nI-I-I.,I-I-Wo01\nNe, xl -Gl_\'etlon\nPhase\nI\nX-33 Concept\n\nRLV\n\nD )ciolon\n\n0eflnltlon/Oesi_n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Buelnels plan\n\xe2\x80\xa2 O_er_toflo _rt\n\xe2\x80\xa2 C_nplemem_y\nllchnoloW\nd*monstralon0\n\nDownulecl\n\'\n\nII\n\nl[el\n\nIII\nPhase\nIII\nOperational\nDtveto,pmertl\nOperations\n\nPhase\nII\nx-33 Developmenb\'Operations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Demot_trlltt\nClttlr, al Techhol(_llel\n\xe2\x80\xa2 r-_,,l\non Olwxatkm*l\nissues\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SIgnlflmmlly Fledtme RLV Developme*_l\n\nIndustry/Government\n\nFigure 5.

X-33 Concepts\n\nDeveloped\n\nDuring\n\nPhase I.\n\nOn April 1, 1996 a Cooperative\nAgreement\nNotice 4\nwas issued calling for proposals for Phase II of the RLV\nTechnology\nprogram, specifically,\nthe design and demonstration of the X-33. On July 2, 1996 the Vice President of the United States announced\nthat the LockheedMartin Skunk Works had been selected to build and fly\nthe X-33 Advanced Technology\nDemonstrator.\nThe selected team consists of Lockheed-Martin\n(led by the\nSkunk Works in Palmdale,\nCA, Rocketdyne\n(Engines),\nRohr (Thermal\n\nProtection\n\nSystems),\n\nAllied Signal (Sub-\n\nsystems),\nand Sverdrup (Ground Support Equipment),\nand various NASA and DoD laboratories.\nNASA issued\na Cooperative\nAgreement\nto Lockheed-Martin\nworth\napproximately\n$1 billion over 42 months to build and\nthen conduct 15 unmanned, suborbital test flights between\nMarch and December\n1999, This cooperative\nagreement\nis a partnership mechanism\nbetween the Government\nand\nindustry which allows both parties to contribute resources\ntowards a common goal - low cost space access in this\ncase. No profit is made by industry. Lockheed-Martin\ncost sharing over $200 million on the X-33 program.\n\nis\n\nweights ascent/reentry\nenvironments,\nfabrication\nmethods and testing approaches.\nThe X-33 is scheduled\nto\ncomplete its first flight by March of 1999. The X-33 will\nlaunch from Edwards Air Force Base in California and\nland at one of three test sites. The vehicle is processed\nhorizontally\nwithin a translating\nshelter, rotated to the\nvertical position, and then launched. Upon landing the\nX-33 is returned to the launch site via the NASA-747\nShuttle Carrier Aircraft.\nBased\n\non the experiences\n\nof X-33\n\nmanufacture,\n\nground and flight testing, decisions will be made by the\nprivate sector and Government\nas to the development\nof\nan operational,\nnext-generation\nreusable launch system\nat the start of Phase III. The selection of the current X-33\ndesign does not imply what such a future RLV system\nwill look like or preclude any other industry company\nfrom pursuing\nsuch a system. The Lockheed-Martin\nSkunk Works proposal for an RLV dubbed "Venture\nStar" is depicted on the launch pad in Figure 8. This particular design features a 45-foot-long\npayload bay that\nwould house removable cargo canisters designed to speed\nlaunch processing.\n\nchanges associated\nwith commercial\ninterests. Also, all\nteaming agreements\namong industry need to be in place\nbefore NASA signs cooperative agreements.\nThe agreements should include details regarding\nauthorities,\nresponsibilities\nand decision processes.\nIn the X-34 case,\nsignificant\nschedule time was lost due to negotiations\nbetween industry partners while the program was in process. Disagreements\nbetween partners led to configuration changes and missed milestones. A number of technical\nissues arose during the process including reaching viable\nvehicle mass fractions, delayed engine selection, and thermal protection\n\nFigure\n\n8. Lockheed-Martin\n\nRLV "Venture\n\nStar".\n\nX-34\nThe X-34 effort was initiated as part of the overall\nReusable Launch Vehicle Technology\nprogram in early\n1995. The NASA objectives were to provide a flight demonstration\nvehicle between DC-XA and X-33, provide\nearly technology\ndemonstration\nof advanced operations\ntechnologies,\nprovide a pathfinder for the more advanced\nX-33 program and to demonstrate\ncost reduction benefits of "new ways of doing business". The initial X-34\neffort combined\nthese government\nobjectives\nwith\nindustry\'s need for a commercially\nviable small launcher\ncapable of placing small payloads ( 1,000 to 2,000-pound\nclass) into low Earth orbit with a factor of three reduction in launch costs.\nThe original X-34 contract was awarded in April\n1995 to an Orbital Sciences Corporation-Rockwell\nteam.\nThe $70 M cooperative\nagreement called for an equivalent amount of cost sharing by the industry team. Based\non OSC\'s experience\nwith the Pegasus air-launch small\npayload launcher, the OSC-Rockwell\nteam proposed an\nair-launched\nX-34 booster configuration.\nHowever, the\nprogram was terminated in March 1996 when the industry partners determined\nthat the economic viability of an\noperational X-34 payload launcher could not justify their\ninvestment.\nA number\neffort.\n\nof lessons\n\nFirst, combining\n\nwere learned\na technology\n\nsystem cost and schedule\n\nissues.\n\nAlthough the initial X-34 effort was unsuccessful\nin\nleading to a flight test vehicle, NASA\'s objectives\nremained and the program was redefined as a pure booster\ntechnology demonstrator\nwithout the commercial\ngoals\nof the earlier program. On March 27, 1996 a NASA Research Announcement\n5 (NRA) was released soliciting\nproposals for a restructured\nX-34 effort to meet NASA\nobjectives of demonstrating\ntechnologies\napplicable\nto\nfuture reusable\nlaunch vehicle systems.\nOn June 10,\nNASA selected Orbital Sciences Corp., Dulles, Virginia,\nfor final negotiations\nleading to the award of a contract\nto build the X-34 demonstrator.\nThe contract negotiations were finalized on August 30. The 30-month contract includes the first two X-34 flight tests and covers a\nprogram valued at approximately\n$50 million with an\nadditional\n$10 million to be spent by NASA in direct\nsupport of the X-34 by NASA Centers and other government agencies.\nThe fast-track X-34 program calls for demonstrating a vehicle that will be capable of flying up to 25 times\na year at a cost of 500,000 dollars or less per flight, attaining altitudes of at least 250,000 feet, and flying at\nspeeds of up to eight times the speed of sound. Flight\ntesting is to begin in the fall of 1998. Other specifications for the vehicle include use of advanced\nthermal\nprotection\nsystems and demonstration\nof the ability to\nfly subsonically through rain and fog. Flights of the X-34\nwill involve testing of new technologies\nsuch as composite material structures, composite\ntanks and new, integrated avionics, as well as demonstrations\nof safe abort\nand autonomous\nlanding techniques,\nin cross winds up\nto 20 knots, using advanced landing systems.\n\nin the initial X-34\ndemonstrator\n\npro-\n\ngram with a commercial\ndevelopment\nprogram results in\nmixed objectives which can be mutually exclusive at times.\nThe primary example from the X-34 program was the\nneed to fly by 1998 in order to support overall RLV needs.\nThis requirement\nseverely limited schedule margin and\nthe program could not accommodate\nmajor configuration\n\nCurrently under study is a design shown in Figure 9.\nThe X-34 is a single-engine\nrocket with short wings and\na small tail surface. The vehicle is 58.3 feet long, 27.7\nfeet wide at wing tip and 11.5 feet tall from the bottom\nof the fuselage to the top of the tail. The X-34 will be\ncarried aloft and launched from an Orbital Sciences L1011 aircraft\n\nat the White\n\nSands Missile\n\nRange\n\nin New\n\na rocket and weighed 2,020 pounds1,200 pounds lighter\nthan the tank used on the DC-X. Yet, the composite\ntank\nprovided the same strength of an aluminum tank. The\nDC-XA aluminum-lithium\noxygen tank weighed nearly\n600 pounds less than its DC-X aluminum\ncounterpart.\nMaterial and structure options development\nwill continue\nas the RLV program matures. Another key area of research and testing by the contractors\ninclude material\ncharacterization,\nprocess development,\nintegration\nand\ntest of both internal and external types of cryogenic tank\ninsulation.

While there\nis considerable\ndiscussion of the merits of one configuration\n\nover another,\n\nthe fact is that any SSTO\n\nmust in-\n\ncorporate a number of newer technologies\nwith many of\nthem common to any configuration.\nSome technologies\nare necessary\nto enable the concept of SSTO (to meet\nthe feasibility\nchallenge),\nwhile others are required to\nmake the system cost-effective,\nreliable, and safe (to meet\nthe practicality\nchallenge).\nSome technologies\nspan the\nfeasibility and practicality\nchallenges\nin SSTO design.\nThe specific technologies\nfor the DC-XA test vehicle has been described in a previous section. The core\ntechnology\nprogram, however, includes additional technology developments\naimed at the X-33, X-34, and operational\nRLV vehicles and is enhanced by contractor\ntechnology\n\ndemonstrations\n\nrelative\n\nto their specific\n\nve-\n\nhicle configurations.\nReusable\n\nCryogenic\n\nTanks\n\nThe design and manufacture\nof large-scale,\nflightweight reusable cryogenic tanks using suitable tank and\ninsulation materials has been considered\nthe most challenging aspect of reusable vehicle design. Multi-use cycling\nand\napplication\nof flight\nloads\non the\naluminum-lithium\nliquid oxygen and graphite composite liquid hydrogen tanks in the Clipper Graham DC-XA\nwere a step towards meeting this challenge. In particular, the composite liquid hydrogen tank, shown in Figure\n10 as it arrived at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center\nfor testing,\n\nwas the first reusable\n\nsuch structure\n\nto fly on\n\nFigure\n\n10. DC-XA\n\nComposite\n\nLiquid\n\nHydrogen\n\nTank.\n\nA documented\nanalysis will be performed\nto demonstrate that selected materials and tank subsystems\nare\nscalable to a full-scale RLV and can be adequately demonstrated by an X-33 vehicle. Correlations\nbetween analytical predictions\nand experimental\ntest results must be\nat a high level of confidence\nto ensure analytical\ntools\nare valid for purposes of full-scale vehicle design.\nComposite\n\nPrimary_ Structures\n\nComposite\nstructures\noffer the potential\nof large\nweight\nsavings\nfor RLVs.

Figure 12 shows a number of TPS panels\non a test fixture that was flown through rain on an F-15\nfighter to examine TPS durability. Also, fail-safe attachment options for metallic and ceramic TPS panels will\nbe examined. New thermal seal designs based on lessons\nlearned form the STS and NASP programs will be tested.\nTest objectives\nare to develop thermal protection\nsystems capable of a 100-mission\nminimum lifetime and\nan order-of-magnitude\nreduction in maintenance\nand inspection requirements\nas compared\nto existing Shuttle\nTPS.\n\nconfiguration\nwhich uses an aerospike engine, emphasis\nin propulsion\nwill be placed on understanding\nthe performance and operations\nof aerospike engines such as\nthe J-2-based aerospike for the X-33, and a new RS-2200\naerospike engine by Rocketdyne for the RLV configuration using liquid oxygen/liquid\nhydrogen propellants.\nA comprehensive\neffort has been underway for the\npast year and a half to characterize\nthe aerodynamics\nof\nthe integrated\nlifting\nbody/aerospike.\nNASA and\nLockheed have tested a 5-percent scale model of the lifting body configuration\nin the supersonic wind tunnel at\nthe Arnold Engineering\nDevelopment\nCenter to characterize the engine exhaust/vehicle\naerodynamic\ninteraction. In the spring of 1996, an individual thrust chamber\n(one of 14) for the LockheedMartin X-33 engine was\ntested at NASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center.\nIt is planned to have the aerospike engine undergo\nearly flight testing to determine\nvehicle aerodynamic/\naerospike engine interactions during flight. These relate\ndirectly to the basic understanding\nof overall engine performance.

The X-34 experience\ndemonstrated\nthe ability to\nstop and restructure\na program quickly when program\nobjectives\n\nwere not met.\n\nIn concert with the fast-track management\napproach\nis the use of X-vehicle demonstrators\nto reduce technical\nrisk and demonstrate\ntechnologies\nand operational\napproaches. Flight demonstrators\nadd confidence to ground\ntest and analytical results that address the technical feasibility and cost advantages to operational reusable launch\nvehicles.

Thirteen test flights will duplicate the\ntrajectory\nof an RLV between flight Mach numbers of\n0.6 through 3.2. The tests will be used to measure installed thrust, demonstrate\nengine operation,\nand validate analysis methods,\nincluding\ncomputational\nfluid\ndynamics (CFD), for use on full scale system design.\n\nprogram,\n\nlooking\n\nto SSTO as\n\nthe goal for low-cost access to space, has been redefining\nthe working relationship between Government\nand industry as well as commercial\nusers and foreign involvement.\nSignificant reductions in development and operations costs\nrequire the streamlining\nof management\nmethods that\noversee technology development\nand demonstrations,\ni.e.\n"new ways of doing business".\nThe National Research\nAgreements (NRAs), and Cooperative Agreement Notices\n(CANs) have been successfully used to quickly set up work\nrelationships\n\nbetween\n\nthe Government\n\nvehicle will engage the primary issues of mass fraction,\npropulsion performance,\nflyability, structures, TPS, and\noperations (both ground and flight).\nSUMMARY\nA fully-reusable,\norbit launch vehicle\n\nrocket-powered\nsingle-stage-tois, at present, considered\nto be the\n\nlikely means of achieving\nNASA Reusable Launch\n\nMANAGEMENT\n& OPERATIONAL\nAPPROACHES\nThe RLV Technology\n\ninitial steps towards these goals, but had limited capabilities in investigating\nthe harsh flight environments,\nmass fraction requirements,and\nmore complex operations\nof operational\nsystems. Issues of reliability and risks of\nflight test provide insight into implementing\nfuture program structure. The X-33 Advanced Technology\nDemonstrator and X-34 Testbed Technology\nDemonstration\n\nand industry.\n\nThe use of small, efficient project offices is critical\nto demonstrating\nlow-cost developments,\nstreamlining\nacquisition\nprocedures,\nminimizing\nGovernment\noversight and providing for the "cultural changes" needed to\nmeet cost reduction goals. The RLV program management office, for example, is staffed with no more than 20\npeople. The DC-XA program demonstrated\nthat a small\nGovernment/industry\nproject team could design, develop,\nand integrate advanced technology\ncomponents\ninto an\nexperimental\nflight system within budget and schedule\n\naffordable access to space. The\nVehicle Technology\nProgram\n\nis working the challenges\nof SSTO by addressing\nboth\nthe technical and programmatic\naspects of new vehicle\ndevelopment.\nIndustry/Government\npartnerships\nhave\nbeen established with the Clipper Graham DC-XA, X-33,\nand X-34 elements of the RLV program. Technologies\nrequired for SSTO including reusable cryogenic\ntanks,\ncomposite primary structures, durable thermal protection,\nand operable main propulsion systems are under development. The DC-XA, X-33 and X-34 flight vehicles have\nand are demonstrating\nthese technologies\nto a degree so\nas to lend confidence to the decision to proceed with fullscale RLV development.\nUnderstanding\nof risks involved\nin program execution and flight tests are being factored\ninto the ongoing program elements.\nThe technology\n\nand flight demonstration\n\nprograms\n\nunderway will support Government\nand industry decisions at the end of the decade relating to an RLV operational vehicle. This decision will take into account the\nDoD progress in the Evolved Expendable\nLaunch Vehicle program, the evolution and outlook for commercial markets,\nbudget limitations,\nand national\nneeds.\nTogether, these factors will determine\nwhat form a feasible, practical future launch system will take.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nNASA, "Reusable\n\nLaunch Vehicle\n\n(RLV), Advanced\n\nTechnology Demonstrator, X-33", Cooperative\nNotice CAN 8-1, Jan. 12, 1995.\n\nAgreement\n\n2.\nNASA, "Reusable\nLaunch Vehicle (RLV), Small\nReusable Booster, X-34",\nCooperative Agreement Notice CAN 8-2, Jan. 12, 1995.\n3.\nGaubatz, W.
