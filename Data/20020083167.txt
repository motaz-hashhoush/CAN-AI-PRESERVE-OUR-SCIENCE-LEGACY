b'Health and Medicine\n\nFood Service System\n\nn a hospital that\nmust serve a thousand or more meals\na day, food must be\ncooked well in advance,\nstored hot until mealtime, then delivered to\npatients some distance\nfrom the central\nkitchen. In the process,\nmeals can lose heat,\nmoisture, flavor and\nnutrients.\nA recentlvintroduced answer to\nthat problem is the 3M\nFood Service System 2,\na system whose origin is rooted in space\ntechnology. Developed by 3M Health Care,\nSt. Paul, Minnesota, the system employs a\n"cook/chill" concept for plating, storing,\nheating and serving daily meals on a volume\nbasis. It allows hospital and food service\nstaffs to prepare food well in advance,\nseparating the food preparation function\nfrom the meal schedule, while maintaining\nmeal quality.\nThe advantages to the patient, says\n3M, are foods that are still hot at serving\ntime, look more appealing, taste better and\nsuffer no loss of nutritional value, because\nthe cook/chill technology helps retain nutrients. The advantages to hospital administrators and food service directors are scheduling flexibility, labor costs estimated at 10-15\npercent lower than traditional hot food\nsytems, and reduction of total operating\ncosts by as much as 20 percent.\nThe key to the cook/chill approach\nis the technology of integral heating, in\nwhich each 3M plate and bowl heats independently, so that hot foods stay hot and\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\ncold foods stay cold. This integral heating\nmethod was developed by 3M under NASA\ncontract in 196667 for meal service aboard\nthe Apollo lunar spacecraft.\nThe main component of the Apollo\ndevelopment was a unique, electrically heated, insulated dish that served as both plate\nand oven when slipped into a control module. The module provided electrical contact\nand a resistive coating on the bottom of the\ndish-oven converted electrical energy to\nheat. In the 1970s, 3M developed a commercial version of the Apollo system that was\nused by a large number of hospitals and\nnursing homes. That system, shown at left,\nserved as the cornerstone for the Food\nService System 2 introduced in 1991.\nIn the new 3M process, the hot portions of meals are cooked a day or more in\nadvance and chilled in bulk containers.\nOn serving day, the meals - still cold - are\nportioned and plated (above), then assembled on trays in 3M Thermalization Carts.\nThe fully-loaded carts are stored in a\nrefrigerator unit.\n\nAt mealtime,\nthe carts are removed\nfrom the refrigerator\nand plugged into a\npower source in the\ncentral kitchen or in\nseparate pantries on\neach floor. The cart\'s\npower module supplies electricity to the\n3M dishes which, like\ntheir Apollo predecessors, convert electrical energy to heat.\nEach plate has builtin sensors that monitor and control the\nheat to maintain each\ndish at ideal serving\ntemperature.\nIn just 24 minutes, the thermalization process is completed. The trays are\nremoved from the\nthermalization cart\n(right) and served to\nthe patient (below);\nthe double-walled dish\nis insulated so that the outside is cool to the\ntouch. According to 3M, patients have\nexpressed high satisfaction with cook/chill\nmeals and with the trayware, round dishes\nand bowls in an array of contemporary colors, designed to resemble more closely the\ndishes used at home.\n\n'
