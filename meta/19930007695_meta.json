Because of the very long travel times to the main asteroid belt, attention has shifted to the asteroids whose orbits bring them fairly close to the Earth. In these schemes, the asteroids would be bagged and then processed during the return trip, with the asteroid itself providing the reaction mass to propel the mission homeward. A mission to one of these near-Earth asteroids would be shorter, involve less weight, and require a somewhat lower change in velocity. Since these asteroids apparently contain a wide range of potentially useful materials, our study group considered only them. The topics covered include asteroid materials and properties, asteroid mission selection, manned versus automated missions, mining in zero gravity, and a conceptual mining method.", "title": "Asteroid mining", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930007695, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gertsch, Richard E."}, "organization": {"name": "Colorado School of Mines", "location": "Golden, CO, United States"}}, "id": "7d30975a53f0469faaf28bc6cdd1f998"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930007695, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930007695, "id": "8406b4faa8c44d6484376bdb5cf1c0f6", "publicationName": "NASA.
