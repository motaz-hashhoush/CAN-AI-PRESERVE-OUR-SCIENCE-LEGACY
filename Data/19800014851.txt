The operational ground facilities\nincluding the Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations, the Satellite Control\nCenter, and the data processing facilities ( with the exception of the Data Collection\nSystem (DCS) processing facility) will be operated by NOAA. The United Kingdom\nprovided a Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU), one of three sounding instruments for\neach satellite. The Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) of France provided\nthe DCS instrument for each satellite and will provide the facilities necessary to\nprocess and make available to users the data obtained from this system. The Centre\nd'Etudes de la Meteorologie Spatiale ( CEMES) of France will provide ground facilities\nfor receipt of sounder data during the blind orbit periods.\nThe NOAA - B satellite is an integrated spacecraft system designed to provide for,\nand control injection into, the required orbit after separation from the Atlas-F launch\n} vehicle. The spacecraft, including the apogee kick motor (AKM), in the launch\nconfiguration is 371 cm high and 188 cm in diameter and weighs nominally 1405 kg.\nOn-orbit, with the AI{M and reaction-controlled equipment expendables consumed,\nthe satellite has a nominal weight of 723 kg.\n+.\t\nThe primary environmental sensors are:\no\t\n\nA TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). The TOVS is a three instrument\nsystem consisting of:\n\n- The Stratospheric Sounding Unit ( SSU) - employing a selective absorption\ntechnique to make measurements in three channels.\nt\n\n- The Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) - a four - channel Dicke radiometer,\n\nmaking passive measurements in the 5.5 mm oxygen band.\nData from the TOVS will be available locally as a part of the HRP T transmission\nand on the spacecraft beacon transmission.\no The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). A four-channel (5\nchannels on later satellites of this series) scanning radiometer sensitive in the\nvisible, near infrared, and infrared window regions.\no The Space Environment Monitor ( SEM). The SEM consists of three separate\ninstruments and a data processing unit. The components are:\n\n4\t\n\nThe Total Energy Detector (TED) - measures a broad range of energetic\nparticles from 0 . 3 keV to 20 keV in 11 bands.\n\n^r\n\nf\n\n4/30/ 80\t\n\nPage 2\n\n\t\n\nE\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2615-80-02\n\nI +^\n\n- The Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector ( MEPED) - senses\nprotons, electrons, and ions with energies from 30 keV to several tens of\nMeV.\n- The High Energy Proton and Alpha Detector (HEPAD) - senses protons\nand alphas from a few hundred MeV up through relativistic particles above\n840 MeV.\no The Data Collection System ( DCS). The DCS is a random access system to\nacquire data from fixed and free -floating terrestrial and atmospheric platforms.\nLAUNCH PECULIARS\nNOAA-B will be launched from the Western Test Range (WTR) by an Atlas-F type\nlaunch vehicle. The second stage, which is integral to the spacecraft, is a TE -364-15\nsolid motor and will be used as an injection motor.\nThe Atlas-F/satellite ascent trajectory is a direct ascent, ballistic type trajectory\nfrom Pad SLC-3W. The booster state vector at satellite separation produces an\napogee altitude of 470 nm at which time the apogee kick motor (AKM) circularizing\nburn is accomplished. After AKM burnout the orbit is trimmed, the satellite is\noriented parallel to ^e orbit normal, and handover to satellite is accomplished.\nFLIGHT SE UENCE OF EVENTS\nseconds\n\nn4\n\nLiftoff\nBooster Engine Cutoff\nJettison Booster Engines\nJettison Fairing\nSustainer Engine Cutoff\n\n0\n121.0\n124.1\n144.0\n324.5\n343.5\n349.5\n456.9\n626.9\n670.4\n675.4\n698.2\n703.0\n758.0\n850.0\n990.0\n1055.0\n1260.0\n1420.0\n1690.0\n1710.0\n2040.0\n\nVernier Engine Cutoff\nSpacecraft Separation\n\nt Main Ignition Attitude\n1, -M-364-15 Ignition\nAKM Burnout\nVelocity Trim\nEnd LTV Trim\n90 Deg Yaw\nStart Roll Rate\nHydrazine Blowdown Start\nHydrazine Blowdown Stop\nDeploy Solar Array\nBoom Deployment\nArray Cant\nVRA Deployment\nUDA Deployment\nHandover\n\n4/30/80\t\n\nPage 3\n\nr\nE-615-80-O'.,\n\nMISSION SUPPORT\nrl\n\nA principal operating feature of the NOAA-B system will be the centralized remote\ncontrol of the satellite, through the CDA stations by the NOAA Environmental Satellite\nService (NESS) Satellite Operation Control Center (SOCC).\nThe primary command and data acquisition stations are GFOM, located at Fairbanks,\nAlaska, and WOMS, located at Wallops Station, Virginia. In addition there will be a\nreduced capability (no command capability) station, located in Lannion, France, to\nreceive tape recorded TIP data from the satellite.\nThe CDA stations will transmit command programs to the satellite, acquire and record\nmeteorological and engineering data from the satellite. All data will be transmitted\nbetween CDA and Suitland via commercial communications links. Commands will be\ntransmitted between SOCC and CDA via commercial communications links.\nThe ground communication links for NOAA-B are provided by SATCOM and NASCOh1.\nNASCOM will provide any launch unique communications links for the NOAH-B launch.\nSATCOM will provide all voice and data links between the SOCC and the CDA station,\nLifter launch. SATcom is provided and operated by NIsSS.\nThe USAF Space and Missile Test Command at VAFB will provide telemetry, tracking,\nand discrete event times for the Atlas vehicle until Loss of Signal (LOS) and will\nprovide radio commanded guidance to the Atlas.\nARIA aircraft have been requested to support telemetry from the integrated spacecraft\nafter LOS from WTR.\nRoutine tracking and orbit determination support will be provided by the USAF. GSFC\nwill be responsible for providing the orbital information to NOAA to satisfy NOAA\nrequirements. All data acquisition will be performed through NOAA CDA stations and\ndata 'Links. During launch and early orbit limited Spacecraft Tracking and Data Network\n(STDN) support for telemetry reception will be required. After launch the NOAA CDA\nstations will handle all telemetry reception. There is no requirement for STDN to\ncommand the spacecraft. There is a requirement requested through the SIRD to have\nbackup use of the ULASKA antenna by GILMORE, on a non-interference basis.\nGSFC will be responsible for providing the orbital information, based on USAF informatic;, routinely supplied to the NOAA/SOCC. Prelaunch nominal orbital information and\nspecial support for initial orbit estimation will be required.\nLifetime trend development and performance monitoring will be a continuous operation\nduring the life of the satellite. It will consist of automatic and manual monitoring\nof data, conditions, and operations together with data analysis, record keeping, and\nreport generation. Data from these operations will be available for retrieval on demand\nas well as appearing in periodic reports. Occasionally NASA will request special\nretrieval or processing of this data by the NOAH operations personnel.\n\nr\n\nr '.\n\n4/30/80\t\n\nPage 4\n\nx\nE-615-80-02\nNOAA-A THROUGH G PROJECT COSTS\n0\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe funding for NOAA-A through G (including spacecraft, sensors, and ground support)\nis provided in the following table.\n(Millions of Dollars)*\nFY 79 & P\t\n\nFY 80\n\nFY 81\n\nT.C.\n\nTotal\n\nSpacecraft\n(7 ea)\nInstruments\n(7 sets)\nGround Operations\nIMS\n\n5.9\n\n3.9\n\n3.4\n\n78.8\n\n221.4\t\n\n.4\n\n2.2\n\n2.0\n\n27.0\n\n.8\t\n.5\t\n\n.3\n.2\n\n.3\n.2\n\nTOTALS\n\nI !,\t\n\n65.6\t\n\n89.3\t\n\n6.8\n\n6.6\n\n.5\n\n1.4\nt.4\n\n5.9\n\n108.6\n\n*NOAH Reimbursable\nA more detailed description of the NOAA-B mission may be found in the\nMission Operation Report, No. E-615-80-02.\n\n`r\t\nk\n\nr\n\n4/30/80\t\n\nPage 5\n\n1:\n4\nII\n\nh -I) i 6-80\xe2\x80\x9e01\n\nNASA MISSION OBJECTIVES FOR NOAA-B\n\nNASA's primary objectives for the NOAA-B Mission are to launch the spacecraft\ninto a Sun-synchronous orbit of sufficient accuracy to enable the spacecraft\n\nto accomplish its operational mission requirements, conduct an in -orbit evaluation\nand checkout of the spacecraft and, upon completion of this evaluation, turn the\noperational control of the spacecraft over to NOAA/NESS. The orbit will have a\nlocal equator crossing time of approximately 2:30a . m. northbound and 2:30 p.m.\nsouthbound to permit regular and dependable daytime and nighttime meteorological\nobservations in both direct readout and stored modes of operation in support of the\n\nnational operational environmental satellite system and the GARP Global Experiment.\n\n1'1\n\n)V\nL.
