Hamed\n.Jordan University of Science and Technology\nlrbid, .Jordan\nABSTRACT\nAirlines\' revenue generated from scheduled services account for the major share in the total revenue. As such, predicting airlines\' total scheduled services revenue is of great importance both to the\ngovernments (in case of national airlines) and private airlines. This importance stems from the need\nto formulate future airline strategic management policies, determine government subsidy levels, and\nformulate governmental air transportation policies. The prediction of the airlines\' total scheduled\nservices revenue is dealt with in this paper. Four key components of airline\'s scheduled services are\nconsidered. These include revenues generated from passenger, cargo, mail, and excess baggage. By\naddressing the revenue generated from each schedule service separately, air transportation planners\nand designers are able to enhance their ability to formulate specific strategies for each component.\nEstimation results clearly indicate that the four stochastic processes (scheduled services components) are represented by different Box-Jenkins ARIMAmodels. The results demonstrate the appropriateness ofthe developed models and their ability to provide air transportation planners with future\ninformation vital to the planning and design processes.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAirlines are under tremendous pressure to generate more revenues to lessen\ngovernment provided subsidies (in case of national airlines). An airline\'s total\nrevenue basically consists of two major segments. The first segment comprises\nrevenue generated from scheduled services such as passenger, cargo, mail, and\nexcess baggage. The second segment comprises revenue generated from chartering and other non-scheduled services and activities. The revenue generated\nfrom scheduled services accounts for the major bulk of the total airline revenue.\nThe basic difference between the two segments is that the first segment consists of services that are scheduled. As such, revenue generated from these services can be studied over a period of time and for the most part are predictable.\nThe revenue generated from the second segment however can be categorized as\nbeing uncertain (fluctuates widefy over time). The importance of future scheduled services revenue stems from the need to formulate future strategic management policies, determine government subsidy levels, and formulate govemmental transportation policies.\nC1999~\n\nAviation\n\nInstitute~\n\nUniversity of Nebraska at Omaha\n\nHamed\n\n33\n\nBy far, air passenger revenue constitutes the major bulk of the total revenue.\nBecause of fierce competition, airlines are on the move to capture more passengers partly by means of opening new efficient routes and by improving their\nquality of service. It is therefore not surprising to see air passenger demand forecasting evoking the attention of many researchers.\nDifferent techniques have been applied in the literature to predict future airline passenger traffic demand. Waheed, McCullough, and Crawford (1985)\nimplemented the Box-Jenkins methodology to forecast airline passenger\ndemand and assess future airport needs. An aggregate oriented data set was used\nfor that purpose. Ashford and Benchemam on the other hand, developed an airport choice model on the basis of a disaggregate data set (1987). The estimated\nmodel highlighted the major factors that influence airline passenger decisions to\nchoose a particular airport. Although the developed model was not intended to\nforecast airline passenger traffic demand, it nevertheless has the ability to predict air traffic demand. Recently, Rengaraju and Arasan developed a city-pair\nmodel to estimate domestic air travel demand. The specified model was calibrated with a cross-sectional aggregate data taken from 40 city pairs (1992).\nOther studies in this area include the work by Moore and Soliman ( 1981 ), Skinner (1976), Ozoka and Ashford (1988), and Harvey (1987).\nNearly most of the previous work done in this area was geared toward the prediction of air passenger traffic. Recognizing air passenger revenue as being the\nmajor contributor to the total airline revenue, it is also equally important to consider other sources of revenues in proper future strategic planning. Since each\nrevenue component is affected by different external factors it is expected that\neach component will have its own characteristics and structure. Furthermore,\naddressing each component separately enhances air transportation planners,\ndesigners, as well as airlines to formulate specific strategies for each component.\nTo this end, no attempts were made to model the revenue generated from the\nairlines\' scheduled services. This paper will explicitly address the total revenue\ngenerated from scheduled services, namely passenger, cargo, mail, and excess\nbaggage. These stochastic processes will be represented by time-series models.\nThe specified models will be estimated with the use of data obtained from the\nRoyal Jordanian Airlines (RJA).\n\nMODEL DEVELOPMENT\nA number of mathematical techniques can be used to model the airline\'s total\nscheduled services revenue. These include multiple regression, econometric,\nand time-series analysis. Both multiple regression (special case of econometric\nmodels) and econometric models require variations in a number of economic\nfactors to forecast the revenue generated from each airline\'s scheduled services.\nTime series models on the other hand require only the time-lagged values of\neach scheduled service revenue (past behavior of each revenue). Furthermore,\n\n34\n\nJournal ofAir Transportation World Wide\n\nutilizing time series models would explicitly account for patterns in the past\nvariations of the scheduled services revenues, thus making them more widely\nused particularly in circumstances where information on variations in economic\nfactors is lacking or unavailable.\nLet Yi(t) represent the yearly generated revenue from the ith scheduled airline service (passenger, cargo, mail, or excess baggage). Since the collection of\nactivities in each service is ordered in time, the process is called a stochastic\nprocess. A number ofstochastic processes can be used to model the revenue generated from the aforementioned services. These processes include; Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), pure Autoregressive (AR), pure\nMoving Average (MA), and random walk. When the mean, variance, and the\ncovariance of the process is time invariant, then this process is considered as a\nstationary stochastic process. This implies that the fluctuation of revenue is stable over time. However, most encountered time series are nonstationary in\nnature, particularly those that deal with a passenger\'s choice of an airline and\ndemand for air travel. Hence techniques are sought to overcome the nonstationarity. Of particular interest is the Box-Jenkins (1976) ARIMA models.\nThe success of this method can be attributed to the fact that this methodology\nis capable of dealing with different forms oftime series (stationary, nonstationary, with or without seasonal elements). Furthermore, many computer packages\navailable on the market have full documentation of this method.\nThe general polynomial representation of the Box-Jenkins Integrated model\nfor nonstationary scheduled service revenue time series with seasonality\nARIMA (p,d,q) x (P,D,Q)s can be written as,\n\n<j>p(B)8 p(B)(I-Bf(l-B"fYi(tJ =pq(B}xQ(B)-c,+o\nwhere 8p(B) and pq(B) are polynomials representing regular autoregressive and\nmoving average of order p and q respectively. <j>P(B) and xQ(B) are polynomials\nrepresenting seasonal autoregressive and moving average of order P and Q\nrespective! y, -rt is the random error component, and o is the trend parameter. The\ntrend parameter should be included in the model if the differenced series has a\nsignificantly large mean value. The Box-Jenkins methodology is used to convert\nthe nonstationary time series into a stationary one. This conversion can be\nachieved partly by differencing the time series. The order of differencing is\ndetermined by studying the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and the Partial\nAutocorrelation Function (PACF) of the original and of each of the differenced\ntime series derived from it. In some cases however, a power transformation\nmight be needed to stationarize a time series. Once stationarity has been\nachieved, identification of the stationary time series is sought. This is done by\nstudying the ACF and PACF of the converted series.\nIn terms of the original time series which represent the revenue generated\nfrom scheduled services, the models below are called integrated models; ARI\n(p,d,O), IMA (O,d,q), ARIMA (p,d,q) respectively,\n\n35\n\nHamed\nW;rtJ =ljiJW.(t-IJ\n\n+ 4J2Wt(t-2) + ... + ljlpW;rr-PJ =\n\nw,r,1 =e1-r:,r,-JJ\n\n+\n\n"r:t(t)\n\ne2.i(t-2J- . .. - eq.i(t-q) = \'\'r\';\n\nW.r9 =(<jl 1 Wtfl-1) +ljl2 W;rr-2) + ... +cpp W;rt-P;)-(B l"tt(t-IJ +9 2-r: t(t-2} + \xc2\xb7\n\n\xc2\xb7 \xc2\xb7 +9q"t;(t-ql=-r:;(t-q!}\n\nwhere\nfort= 2,3, ... ,N\nwhere ljl1, ... , \xc2\xabJ>p denote autoregressive coefficients, 91, ... ,9q denote moving\naverage coefficients, and -r:t is the disturbance term.\nThe idea then is to specify and estimate all univariate time-series model for\nrevenue generated by each of the four scheduled services.\nDATA DESCRIPTION\n\nRoyal Jordanian Airlines (RIA) is the only national carrier in Jordan. Established in 1963, then under the name of Alia, RIA made great strides over the\nyears. The airline started with three aircraft and\nscheduled flights to three\ndestinations Beirut, Kuwait, and Cairo. Now RIA has a fleet consisting of 19 aircraft (mainly Airbus and Boeing), with 39 destinations in total, and around 117\nflights per week. Furthermore, RIA\'s route network has expanded rapidly over\nthe years. Although, the RIA provide domestic air services (Amman-Aqaba\nroute), international services dominate the RIA operations. Figure 1 shows the\nRIA route map. The total RIA revenue has registered a somewhat continuous\ngrowth.\nThe data set was obtained from the Royal Jordanian Airlines. The data consists of four stochastic processes. The data set represents the components of the\nscheduled services revenue, namely passenger revenue, cargo revenue, mail\nrevenue, and excess baggage revenue. The data set represents the time period\nfrom 1964 until 1993 inclusive.\nFigure 2 shows the evolution of RIA total scheduled services revenue over\ntime. Figure 3 on the other hand shows the contribution of each component of\nthe schedule services to RIA\'s total revenue. The figure clearly shows that on the\naverage passenger revenue constitutes over 70 percent of the total revenue. Both\nmail and excess baggage revenues seem to be relatively uniform over time. The\navailability of air cargo aircraft that were capable of handling various types of\nproducts have positively influenced the revenue generated from cargo traffic.\nFigure 4 shows the contribution ofboth chartering and other non-scheduled\nservices to the RIA\'s total revenue. Unlike the scheduled services revenue both\nrevenues have pronounced peaking and fluctuate widely over time. For :xample, in 1990 revenue generated from both chartered services and other nonscheduled services amounted to 16.3 percent and 21 percent from the total RIA\'s\ntotal revenue respectively. However, such contributions fell to 5.6 percent and\n7.2 percent respectively in 1992. This specific fluctuation can be attributed to\n\nmade\n\nUJ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAJntordam\n\n"\n\n"\'\n\nMoscow\n\nBolgrado\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMontreal\n\n/)<\n\nNew York\n\n;:\n\n~\n\n\xc2\xa3L\n~\n:...\n::;\xc2\xb7\n!:;l\n\n\xc2\xa7\nTunis\n\nCasablanca t\n\nDharan\n\nJeddah\n\nl~Hh\nSanaa\n\nFigure 1.

Even prior to 1990, Figure 4\nclearly shows significant fluctuations in these two revenues.\n\nEMPIRICAL RESULTS\nThe ACF and PACF for each schedule services revenue are shown in Figures\n5 through 8. Without exception, all ACFs of the original series show slowly\ndeclining sinusoidal (slow damping off) with a large spike at lag 1. In fact, Figure 5 shows a large spike approaching unity at lag 1. The PACF plots for all time\nseries show a similar pattern. In that a large spike approaching unity in some\ncases is present at lag l. The ACF and PACF patterns clearly indicate all time\nseries are nonstationary in the mean. A number of regular differencing of the\noriginal series has been carried out. It was found that for all time series, one regular differencing {d = 1) was enough to produce a stationary time series. Figures\n5-8 show time-series plots for each of the above measures. All plots show strong\nevidence ofnonstationarity in the mean. Generally, time series representing all\nthe four schedule services revenue appear to have an upward trend. The decline\nin revenue in some years {e.g. 1967, 1970, and 1988) can be attributed to\nregional instability as a whole, the unprecedented low growth of Jordan\'s economy and the Gulf Crisis.\n\nHamed\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n04-~-y~~-y~nn.n~~~~~~~~~\n\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.8\n-1~----------------------------------------~\n-~~v~~~~~o-~~v~~~~~o-N~~\n\n----------~(\'"""1(\'"\'.1(""\'-..j("",\'\n\nLag\nAutocorrefations\n\n0.9\n\n0.7\n0.5\n0.3\n0.1\n-0.1\n\n-0.3\n-O.Sd---------------------------------------~\n12\n4\n!0\n11\n9\n2\n3\n6\n5\n7\n8\nLag\nPartial Autocorrelations\nFigure 5.

A number of models were considered for each timeseries in an attempt to avoid overfitting or underfitting. The selected model estimation results are shown in Table L The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),\nwhich is a measure of the precision of the estimate and the degree of parsimony\nin the parameterization of the stochastic model, was used to determine the best\ncoefficient values. After considering several models, the model that provided\nthe lowest AIC value was chosen (see Table 2).\nTable I\nScheduled Services Revenue Models Estimation Results, t-statistics in Parentheses\nBest Coefficient\nvalue\n\nScheduled Services\nRevenue Component\n\nModel Structure\n\n1.

For example, passenger revenue\nturned out to be best represented by the ARIMA model (0, I, 1) with no trend,\ncargo revenue by the ARIMA model (1, 1 ,0) with no trend, mail revenue by the\nARIMA model (1,1,1) with a trend, and the excess baggage revenue by the\nmodel (1,1,0) with no trend.\nWith the exception of the mail revenue time series, the remaining time series\ndid not incorporate a constant trend. The trend constant in the mail revenue\nseries turned out to be significantly different from zero at the 5 percent leveL\nFurthermore, the t-statistics show that all parameter estimates are statistically\nsignificant at the five percent level.

Four key components of the airlines\' schedule services were considered. These are passenger\nrevenue, cargo revenue, mail revenue, and excess baggage revenue.\nResults showed that the four stochastic processes are represented by different\nBox-Jenkins ARIMA models. This clearly suggests that each component has its\nown characteristics and structure and as such should be considered separately.\nThe yearly forecasts from each scheduled services revenue component were\nadded up to produce the airline\'s total scheduled services revenue. The generated forecasts turned out to be reasonable and efficient in terms of both the magnitude and direction of forecasts. With the use of such forecasts, airlines can plan\ntheir operations and expenditure according to the expected scheduled services\nrevenue. Furthermore, since forecasts are available for each service, air transportation planners and designers can enhance their skills to evaluate future\ncapacity expansions, predict changes in airline\'s equipment, and formulate\nfuture strategies conceming each service.\n\n48\n\nJournal ofAir Transportation World Wide\n\nREFERENCES\nAshford N. and M.
