b"WEATHER\nINFORMATION SYSTEM\n\nw\n\nI\n\neather is a critical factor in aircraft operations.\nIt is the largest single\ncontributor to flight delays\nand a major cause of\naircraft accidents.\nA study conducted for\nNASA by Ohio State University reported that the principal\ndifficulties in making proper\nflight decisions are the timeliness and clarity of weather\ndata dissemination. Properly\nequipped aircraft can get\nprinted weather reports, but\nthe most common means of\ngetting weather information\nis by voice communication\nwith ground sources. Word\nof mouth reporting over congested radio channels is at\nbest inefficient and at times\nextremely difficult - for\nexample, in critical weather\nwhen a large number of airmen are working the radio.\nTo advance the technology of in-flight weather reporting, Langley Research Center\ndeveloped - in the early\n1990s - a cockpit weather\ninformation system known as\nCWIN (Cockpit Weather\nInformation). The system\ndraws on several commercial\ndata sensors to create radar\nmaps of storms and lightning, together with reports\nof surface observations.\n\n-.\n\nNY4ENT\n\nAND RESOURCES\nMANAGEMENT\n\n!\n\nI\nShown above is a CWIN display in the simulation cockpit\nof Langley's Transport Systems Research Vehicle\n(TSRV), a modified jetliner\nused to test advanced technologies. The CWIN display is\nthe lower right screen among\nthe four center panel\nscreens; in this instance it\nshows color-coded categorical weather at airports\nthroughout the U.S. By pushing a button, the pilot may\nselect from a menu of\nseveral displays, such as a\nceiling/visibility map, radar\nstorm map, or lightning strike\nmap (right above).\nIn simulation tests during\n1993, pilots from several airlines and aerospace manufacturing companies flew the\nCWIN-equipped TSRV. A consensus indicated that CWIN\noffered improved safety, better weather monitoring and\nsubstantial fuel savings, due\nto fewer miles detouring\n\naround storms. Principal\nCWIN developer Charles H.\nScanlon, Langley aerospace\ntechnologist, estimated that\na typical U.S. airline could\ncut its operating costs by\n$5.9 million annually with a\nsystem like CWIN.\nThis NASA technology has\nbeen adapted to commercial\nuse by ARNAV Systems, Inc.,\nPuyallup, Washington. Now\nin service aboard general aviation aircraft is the company's System 6, a key feature\nof which is a weather\ndatalink known as WxLinkTM.\nARNAV's WxLink employs\nseveral CWIN features,\namong them are the lightning\ngraphics and ground-based\nradar summaries.\nWxLink is an aviation\nweather system based on\nadvanced airborne sensors,\nprecise positioning available\nfrom the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS),\ncockpit graphics and a low-\n\ncost datalink. It is a two-way\nsystem that uplinks weather\ninformation to the aircraft\nand downlinks automatic\npilot reports of weather\nconditions aloft.\nPanAm Weather Services,\nMinneapolis, Minnesota,\nwhich operates 312 WeatherMation sites in 38 states, provides the weather data input,\nregularly updated, for the\nuplink from ground to cockpit. ARNAV airborne equipment transmits PIREPS\nweather reports via satellite\nback into the National Weather System for dissemination\nto other users.\nARNAV's System 6 is not\none product but a family of\nproducts designed for integration into a complete application. The cockpit display\nincludes, in addition to the\nweather information, moving\nmap navigation, engine and\nenvironment monitoring, a\nchecklist library, condition\nalerts and digital messaging.\nThe key unit is the MFD\nMulti-Function Display (MFD\n5000 in monochrome, MFD\n5100 in color), which packs\nthe performance of several\nsystems into a single display.\n\nAt right, the MFD 5100 is\nshown on the instrument\npanel of a demonstrator light\ntwin; below is a closeup of\nthe weather and other informational displays available\nto the pilot. The MFD performs health checks on 70\nonboard systems and alerts\nthe crew to difficulties; it is\n\nfully integrated to deliver\ncrew advisories on navigation, fuel management,\nenvironment, air data, engine\nand airframe condition; and\nit watches for off-altitude and\naltitude clearance situations.\nTMWxLink a trademark of ARNAV\nis\nSystems, Inc.\n\nENVIRONMENT\nAND RESOURCES\nMANAGEMENT\n\n"
