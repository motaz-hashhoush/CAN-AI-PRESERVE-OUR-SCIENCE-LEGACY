This was 1.69\nmillion km2 greater than the record minimum set in 2012, but was still the sixth smallest\nice extent of the satellite record (1979-2013).\nThe amount of first year sea ice continues to increase, accounting for 78% of the ice\ncover in March 2013.\nA satellite-derived, Arctic Ocean-wide decrease in sea ice freeboard, from 0.23 m in\nMarch 2011 to 0.19 m in March 2013, implies a 0.32 m decrease in ice thickness, from\n2.26 m to 1.94 m.\n\nSea Ice Extent\nSea ice extent is used as the basic description of the state of the Arctic sea ice cover. Satellitebased passive microwave instruments have been used to determine sea ice extent since 1979.\nThere are two months each year that are of particular interest: September, at the end of\nsummer, when the sea ice reaches its annual minimum extent, and March, at the end of winter,\nwhen the ice is at its maximum extent. The sea ice extent in March 2013 and September 2013\nare presented in Fig. 19.\n\n38\n\nFig. 19. Sea ice extent in March 2013 (left) and September 2013 (right), illustrating the respective monthly\naverages during the winter maximum and summer minimum extents. The magenta lines indicate the\nmedian ice extents in March and September, respectively, during the period 1981-2010. Note that the\nmedian ice extents are computed over a different time interval than the one (1979-2000) used in previous\nArctic Report Cards, as explained by NSIDC at http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/baseline-change.html.\nMaps are from NSIDC at nsidc.org/data/seaice_index.\n\nBased on estimates produced by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) the sea ice\ncover reached a minimum annual extent of 5.10 million km2 on September 13, 2013. This was\nsubstantially higher (1.69 million km2) than the record minimum of 3.41 million km2 set in 2012\n(Fig. 20), making it the largest September minimum ice extent since 2006. However, the 2013\nsummer minimum extent was still 1.12 million km2 below the 1981-2010 average minimum ice\nextent. In March 2013 ice extent reached a maximum value of 15.04 million km2 (Fig. 20), 3%\nbelow the 1981-2010 average. This was slightly less than the March 2012 value, but was typical\nof the past decade.\n\nFig. 20. Time series of ice extent anomalies in March (the month of maximum ice extent) and\nSeptember (the month of minimum ice extent). The anomaly value for each year is the difference\n(in %) in ice extent relative to the mean values for the period 1981-2010. The black and red lines\nare least squares linear regression lines. The slopes of these lines indicate ice losses of -2.6% and\n-13.7% per decade in March and September, respectively.\n\n39\n\nSea ice extent has decreasing trends in all months and virtually all regions (the exception being\nthe Bering Sea during winter). As of 2013, the September monthly average trend is -13.7% per\ndecade relative to the 1981-2010 average (Fig. 20). This is slightly lower than the trend (-14%\nper decade relative to the 1981-2010 average) in 2012, which was the twelfth consecutive year\nof progressively larger trends of summer ice retreat. Trends are smaller during March (-2.4%\nper decade, Fig. 20), but are still decreasing and statistically significant.\nThere was a loss of 9.69 million km2 of sea ice between the March and September extents. This\nis the smallest seasonal decline since 2006. After reaching the March maximum extent, the\nseasonal decline began at a rate comparable to the 30-year average (not shown). Through the\nend of June the 2013 ice extent was just slightly less than the 30-year average values. For a\nfew weeks in late-June and early-July the decrease in ice extent was greater than average.\nSubsequently, the 2013 ice extent tracked the shape of the average ice extent curve for the\nremainder of the summer melt season, but at a value about one million km2 less than the\naverage curve.\n\nAge of The Ice\nThe age of the sea ice is another key descriptor of the state of the sea ice cover. The age of the\nice is an indicator for its physical properties including surface roughness, melt pond coverage,\nand ice thickness. Older ice tends to be thicker and thus more resilient to changes in\natmospheric and oceanic forcing than younger ice. The age of the ice can be determined using\nsatellite observations and drifting buoy records to track ice parcels over several years (Tschudi\net al. 2010). This method has been used to provide a record of ice age since the early 1980s\n(Fig. 21). The distribution of ice of different ages illustrates the extensive loss in recent years of\nthe older ice types (Maslanik et al. 2011).\n\n40\n\nFig. 21. Sea ice age in March 1988, 2011, 2012 and 2013, determined using satellite\nobservations and drifting buoy records to track the movement of ice floes.\n\nAlthough the minimum sea ice extent rebounded somewhat in 2013, the distribution of ice age\ncontinued to favor first-year ice (FYI, ice that has not survived a melt season), which is the\nthinnest ice type (e.g., Maslanik et al. 2007). In March 2013, FYI comprised 78% of the ice, up\nslightly from 75% in 2012. In March 1988, 58% of the ice pack was composed of first-year ice.\nMeanwhile, the trends continue for the recent loss of the oldest ice types, which accelerated\nstarting in 2005 (Maslanik et al. 2011). For the month of March, the oldest ice (4 years and\nolder) has decreased from 26% of the ice cover in 1988 to 19% in 2005 and to 7% in 2013.\nAt the end of winter 2013 little multiyear ice was detected in much of the Beaufort Sea (Fig. 21,\nlower right; and Richter-Menge and Farrell 2013). There is no precedent in the satellite-derived\nrecord of ice age for the near-absence of old ice in this region, which appears to have been due\nto a combination of the previous year's record sea ice retreat and a lack of subsequent transport\nof multiyear ice into the Beaufort Sea during winter 2012-2013. Negligible multiyear ice transport\ninto the Beaufort Sea continued during summer 2013. Nor did multiyear ice drift into Siberian\nArctic waters, which is also very rare. Multiyear ice remained confined to the region north of\nGreenland and northernmost Canada during 2013.\n\n41\n\nIce Thickness\nThe key state variable for the Arctic sea ice cover is ice thickness. In recent years, ice thickness\nhas been estimated over limited regions by aircraft, e.g., the NASA Operation IceBridge\n(Richter-Menge and Farrell 2013), and over large regions by satellite. The CryoSat-2 satellite,\noperated since 2011 by the European Space Agency, measures ice freeboard, the height of ice\nfloes above the water line. Preliminary analysis indicates that the Cryosat-2 freeboard estimates\nare comparable to in situ field measurements, with a level of uncertainty that is comparable to\nother airborne and satellite-based observations. A more detailed error analysis of the freeboard\nestimates is currently in progress. Calculation of the actual sea-ice thickness from freeboard\nrequires knowledge of snow depth, but in general higher freeboard indicates thicker sea ice.\nTherefore, freeboard maps in spring in the period from 2011 to 2013 are a proxy for sea ice\nthickness at the time of maximum ice extent (Fig. 22). During the three years of observation by\nCryosat-2, the average freeboard has decreased by 0.04 m, from 0.23 m in 2011 to 0.19 m in\n2013 (Laxon et al. 2013). Assuming no significant change in snow depth, the decline in\nfreeboard amounts to a mean sea ice thinning of 0.32 m, from 2.26 m in 2011 to 1.94 m in 2013.\nAs with the ice age maps (Fig. 21), the Cryosat-2 freeboard maps indicate that most of the\nthickest and oldest ice occurs to the north of Greenland and northernmost Canada, and it is a\nsmall proportion of the total sea ice cover at the end of winter (Fig. 22).\n\nFig. 22.
