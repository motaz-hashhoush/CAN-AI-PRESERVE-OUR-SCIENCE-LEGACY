Psyche\u2019s electric propulsion system relies heavily on Maxar\u2019s heritage EP-140 subsystem centered on the SPT-140. The evolution to the EP-140DS demonstrates an expanded thruster discharge capability from 0.9kW through 4.5kW and includes the addition of a constant keeper current function. This system, with development support from industry experts at JPL, will serve as the primary propulsion on board the Psyche spacecraft through the 3.6 year cruise to the Psyche asteroid. Subsystem level testing to validate the first EP-140DS design is complete. Major findings from system testing including xenon flow control loop timing, noise hardening, and constant keeper current and test activities are now being implemented in hardware and the status and plans are discussed.", "title": "Maxar Electric Propulsion Development for Deep Space", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001492, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chaplin, Vernon"}}, "id": "b41d652df49446b286264b3ad5d83d25"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001492, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Snyder, John Steven"}}, "id": "1251e24fafde457ba889413c5a6738b4"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001492, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Malone, Shane"}}, "id": "a21136dd11834efa80da99357a44b29e"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001492, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lenguito, Giovanni"}}, "id": "cb4bb613c2be4d549bd41f5a8f26dbe5"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001492, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Aghazadeh, Faraz"}}, "id": "811993af242d4354b406b91c845c296e"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001492, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kerl, Taylor"}}, "id": "7494225c4fca4200afc91593185ff1e9"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001492, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Snyder, Steve"}}, "id": "07589ef6e83a405d9da3707b976bfe23"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:50:38.5595720+00:00", "id": 20220001492, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/53201", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20220001492, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2020", "id": "26955115538c4d28a6d7d14b075a8436", "publicationDate": "2020-08-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
