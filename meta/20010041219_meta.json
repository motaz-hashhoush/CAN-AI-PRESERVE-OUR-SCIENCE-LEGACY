These events include the Galileo data suggesting subsurface oceans in the Jovian system, ever stronger suggestions of near-surface water on Mars, as well as the complex structure observed for the Mars polar caps. And, of course, interest in icy cometary bodies is as old as humankind. Finally, the Mars north polar cap may conceivably cover and protect an ancient ocean floor, an obvious candidate ancient or extant habitat. In short, our interest in searching for life embraced early on the search for liquid water, and that has led us to an additional appreciation for water ice as both a commonplace partner with liquid water and as an issue to be addressed in the exploration of a host of interesting sites. In general, the spectrum of specialized technology for space exploration has not yet been broadened to include the requirements brought about by exploration of icy sites. We argue that technologies for access, operations, and science in icy solar system sites must be examined and their prioritized development initiated in order to successfully plan missions to these compelling sites over the next two decades.
