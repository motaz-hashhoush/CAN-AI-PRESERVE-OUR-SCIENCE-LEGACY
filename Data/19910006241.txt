The Laboratory\nTelerobotic Manipulator (LTM) is a highly advanced 7 degrees-offreedom (DOF) telerobotic/robotic manipulator. It was developed\nand built for the Automation Technology Branch at NASA\'s\nLangley Research Center (LaRC) for work in research and to\ndemonstrate ground-based telerobotic manipulator system\nhardware and software system,, for future NASA applications in\nthe hazardous environment of space. The LTM manipulator uses\nan embedded wiring design with all electronics, motor power, and\ncontrol and communication cables passing through the pitch-yaw\ndifferential joints. This design requires the number of cables\npassing through the pitch/yaw joint to be kept to a minimum. To\neliminate the cables needed to carry each pitch-yaw joint\'s sensor\ndata to the VME control computers, a custom-embe ided.\nelectronics package for each manipulator joint was developed. The\nelectronics package collects and sends the joint\'s sensor data to the\nVME control computers over a fiber optic cable. The electronics\npackage consist of five individual subsystems: the VME Link\nProcessor, the Joint Processor and the Joint Processor power\nsupply in the joint module, the fiber optics communications\nsystem, and the electronics and motor power cabling.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe NASA Space Station Program presents new opportunities for the\napplication of telerobotic and robotic systems in the hazardous environment of\nspace. The Space Station Program will require a significant increase in\nextravehicular activity and the hazards associated with such activities. To reduce the\nextravehicular activity by humans during the construction and the maintenance of\nthe space station, new research and development emphasis is being placed on\nteleoperation and robotic systems for space applications. The LTM was developed\nand built by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for the Automation\nTechnology Branch at NASA\'s Langley Research Center (LaRC). LTM is being\nused at LaRC for research and to demonstrate ground-based telerobotic\n* Research sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\nLangley Research Center\n"Former Employee\n+ Managed by Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc., for the U.S. Department of\nEnergy under contract DE-ACO5-84OR21404\n\nmanipulator system hardware and software systems for future NASA applications in\nthe hazardous environment of space,\nLTM is a highly advanced, 7-DOF telerobotic/robotic manipulator system.\nLTM incorporates force transmission traction drives, joint modularity, redundant\nkinematics, state-of-the-art hardware, and software hierarchical control techniques.\nThe LTM manipulators allow for robust, high-dexterity teleoperations and\nautonomous robotic operation [1].\nLABORATORY TELEROBOTIC MANIPULATOR SYSTEM\nThe LTM system is designed for teleoperation and robotic operation with\ncapabilities for future enhancements of both the hardware and the software systems.\nFor teleoperation, the LTM system consists of right and left master/slave parrs of\nredundant kinematic manipulators. For robotic operation, the slave manipulators\noperate independently of the master manipulators and function as a single pair of\nrobot manipulators with redundant kinematics.\nEach manipulator consists of three 2-DOF (pitch-yaw) modules (shoulder,\nupper arm, forearm) connected together with "L" brackets to form a 6-DOF\nmanipulator. The manipulator\'s seventh DOF is the wrist roll module attached to\nthe forearm m.^dule. Attached to the master manipulator wrist roll module is the\noperator hand controller and attached to the slave manipulator wrist roll module is a\nmotor-driven gripper.\nThe LTM computer system consists of two separated commercial, modular,\nmultiprocessor VMEbus computer systems. One computer system controls the\nmaster manipulator pair. The second computer system controls the slave\nmanipulator pair in either teleoperation or robotic operation (FIG. 1). Each\ncomputer system consisted of three Motorola single-board 68020 computers\noperating in parallel with a 16.67-MHz clock. A 1-MB global memory board is\nused for the shared data base. One computer board is used for system control and\ndata communication between the VME computers and to and from the manipulators.\nThe other two computer boards, one for each manipulator, run the manipulator\ncontrol algorithms, safety checks, robotics, and electronic counterbalancing. The\ntwo VME computer systems swap the manipulators\' data and system data at 250 IIz\nover a 10-Mbaud high-speed, serial fiber optics link [2].\nThe computer interface to the manipulator hardware is provided by an 1/0\nboard, A/D board, and D/A boards, and two link processor motherboards. The\ndigital I/O board is used to monitor and control the pulse width modulation (PWM)\nmotor drives. The A/D boards, one per manipulator pair, are for monitoring the\nsystem voltages and the manipulator motor current sensors. The D/A boards, one\nper manipulator, send the control signals to the joint motor PWM amplifiers. The\nlink processor motherboards collect the joint module data (FIG. 2).\nThe LTM manipulator utilizes an embedded wiring design with all of the\nelectronics power, motor power, and control and communication cables passing\nthrough each of the joint module pitch-yaw differential joints (FIG. 3). The cable\ndesign eliminates cables and connectors outside the manipulator framework.\nBecause of the limited mechanical size of the joint module, the LTM design requires\nthat the number of cables passing through each of the pitch/yaw joints of the module\nbe minimized. To eliminate thove cables required to carry the pitch-yaw joint sensor\nand control data to the VME control computer system, a custom-embedded\nelectronics data collection package for the manipulator joint modules was developed.\n\n\t\n\nMM\t\nMac \t\n\nSLAVE\nVME\nSYSTEM\n\nVME\t R\t\nSYSTEM\t\n\nLEFT ARM\t\nSHOULDER\t\nJP1\t\n\nRIGHTARM\n\n.J\t\n\nRIGHTARM\t\n\nLEFT ARM\t\n\nI SHOULDER\t\nJP1\t\n\nI I I I I I\t\n\nSHOULDER\t\nJP1\t\n\nSHOULDER\nJP1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1\t\n\nELBOW\t\nJP2\t\n\nELBOW\t\nJP2\t\n\nELBOW\t\nJP2\t\n\nELBOW\nJP2\n\nWRIST\t\nJP3\t\n\nWRIST\t\n\nWRIST\t\n\nWRIST\n\nJP3\t\n\nJP3\t\n\nJP3\n\nFIG. 1. The LTM block diagram.\nThe electronics package collects and packages the joint module sensor data and\nsends the data packet to the VME control computer over a single, fiber optic \'line.\nThe electronic package also sends command packets from the computer system to\nthe joint module over the same fiber optic line. The electronics package for the joint\nmodules consists of five individual subsystems: the Link Processor (LP) on a VME\nmotherboard, the Joint Processor logic (JPI) and the Joint Processor power supply\n(JPp) in the joint module, the fiber optic communications system, and the\nelectronics and motor power cabling.\nThe LTM manipulator consists of two types of joint module sizes: a large\njoint module for the shoulder and elbow on the slave manipulator, and a smaller size\nfor the other joint modules used in the master and slave manipulators. The\nelectronics packages are identical for each of the joint modules of the manipulators\nexcept in one detail. The velocity filters for the resolver-to-digital convertors for the\nJPls in the the large joint module differ from the filter circuits in the small joint\nmodules. The reason for this difference is the lower geardrive ratio for the large\njoint module. The filters consist of discrete resistors and capacitors for the\nconverters and can be easily changed. Therefore, any component of the electronics\npackage, except the JPI, can be moved to any location within the manipulator\nsystem, and any JPI may be moved to any joint module that has the same converter\nfilters.\nLINK PROCESSOR\nThe LP is the interface between the VME computer system and a joint\nmodule. The LP is a single-circuit module that plugs into a VMEbus motherboard\nwith an 80--pin connector. The motherboard provides the address decoding and the\ndata bus between the VMEbus and each of the three LP modules, one LP for each of\nthe manipulator joint modules. There is a separate motherboard for each of the\nmanipulator arms.\n\n\t\n\nPWM AMPS\t\n\n68020DISK\nCONTROLLER\t\nSYSTEM\t\nPR(CPSOR\t\nMa-Aer Rack\n\nAA)\t\n\nPIQ\t\n\nPWM AMPS\n\nDIA\t\n\nMAC 11\t\n\nD/A\n\nVMEbus\n\nLINK\t\nSYSTEM68020\t\nARM\t\nPROCESSOR\t\nINTROLLE\t\nPROCESSOR BASEBOARD \t\n(SC)\t\n(AP2)\nr - - - -\t\nLEFT\t\n\nLINK\t\nPROCESSOR\t\nBASEBOARD\t\n\t\n\n--\n\n68020\t\nARM\t\nPROCESSOR\n(API)\t\n\nE-_,\nRIGHT\t\n\nI\t\n\nJP1\t\n\nJPt\t\n\nJP2\t\n\nl\t\n\nCOMM.\nPROCESSI\n\nJP3\t\n\nSlane\n\nJP2\n\nJP3\t\n\nI\t\nI\n\nProteon\n\nI\n\nI\nL \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 LOCATED IN LT ARM . \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 J\nFIG. 2. The LTM board level block diagram.\nThe LP module is a 2- by 4-in., 4-layer, double-sided printed circuit board\nwith 15 surface-mounted device (SMD) chips and a pin gate array (PGA) dual-port\nRAM chip. The VME computer system communicates with the LP through the 4\nKB of memory-mapped dual-port RAM, IDT71331,70G. The microprocessor used\non the LP is the Intel N80C196KA microcontroller operating with a 10-MHz clock.\nThe microcontroller has a 16-bit multiplexed data and address bus, high-speed I/O\npins, and an RS-232 port. The LP system has 16 KB of PROM, N27C64, which\ncontains the startup and the communication code. There are 16 KB of SRAM,\nIDT7164L, which holds the application code that is downloaded from the VME\nsystem at LP startup or restart. The LP board address decoding is provided with an\nAltera EP60OLC programmable logic array chip. Communication with the JPI via\nthe fiber optics link is controlled by an Intel N82588, a 2-Mbaud local area network\ncontroller chip, using a 16-MHz crystal. Using the Maxim MAX232 chip and the\nmicroprocessor RS-232 port, the LP is provided with RS -232 for direct serial\ncommunications for debugging the LP independently of the VME interface. Other\nsupport chips on the LP include the data and address line buffers, 74HC373 and\n74HC245, and the system reset circuit with a reset button on the front of the LP\nmotherboard.\nThe startup and communication code is the same on the LP as that on the JPI\n[3]. The startup code is used to bring the LP on-line with the VME computer, then\nthe LP is used to bootstrap the JPI. The LP application program is downloaded to\nthe LP from the VME system after LP startup or reset. The application program can\nbe changed at any time to meet any new requirements for LP. The LP application\nprogram is used to request, collect, sort, store, and perform safety checks on the\ndata from the JPI. To collect the joint module data, the LP sends a request to the JPI\nfor joint data and after receiving and sorting the joint data, the LP passes the data to\nthe VME system via the memory-mapped dual-port RANI. The LP sends the data\n\nM.\t\n\nr\t\n\nws\n^\t\n\no\t\n\n1\t\n1\n\n^\n\nr\n\nw\t\n\n^r\n\nfar.\n\nr\n\nr\t\n\n^\n\na\n\n^\n\n1\nn\t\n\nn\n\nr.\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3. The LTM electronics and placement.\nrequest commands every 1.6 ms asynchronous to the VME system operation of\n4 ms. The LP also passes commands from the VME system to the JPI.\nThe LP fiber optic transceiver module is mounted on a separate circuit board\nand is connected to each of the LPs with a cable. The cable connects the\ncommunications chip, the Intel N82588, directly to the differential driver and\nreceiver chip, SN75179BD. \'The differential driver output is connected to the\ncurrent driver circuit, which powers the LED transmitter in the transceiver module.\nThe transceiver optical receiver detector is connected to the differential receiver. A\ndetailed discussion of the complete transceiver is given later in this paper.\nJOINT PROCESSOR\nThe data acquisition module in each joint module consists of two circuit\nboards. One board, the JPI, contains the computer and 1/0 systems, and the other\nboard is the JPI power supply, JPp. Each board is mounted in the joint module\ninside its own metal container with a removable cover for access. The containers\nare used to shield the circuit boards from electromagnetic noise of the motor power\nduring joint operation. The two containers are mounted in spaces next to the drive\nmotors of the joint module.\nThe JPI is the data collection board for the LP-JPI pair for each joint module.\nThe JPI basic computer and communication systems are the same as that on the LP.\nThe JPI uses the same chip devices for the following functions: 16-bit\nmicroprocessor, 16 KB of PROM and SRAM, buffer and RS-232 chips, and the\nfiber optic communication chips. The PROM contains the same startup and\ncommunication code as the LP. The SRAM holds the JPI application program,\nwhich is downloaded from the VME system via the LP at system startup or reset.\nThe communication system for the JPI is the same as that on the LP system. The\nJPI collects the joint module data and sends these data to the LP when requested by\nthe LP. The data collected by the JPI consist of the joint module pitch and yaw\nposition and velocity, and the velocity, torque, position, and temperatures of the\nmotors. The JPI for the wrist joint also collects data from the wrist roll position.\nFor the master manipulator, the wrist JPI collects the master grip commands. The\n\nJP1 also carries out commands from the VME system, such as locking and\nunlocking the brakes.\nThe JPl is a 2- by 7-in., 8-plane double-sided printed circuit board with a\ntotal of 39 SMD chips mounted on both sides of the board. The JPl uses the\nequivalent cpu, RAM, PROM, PAL, communication chips, and startup software as\nthe LP, Five of the eight circuit board planes carry for the digital signals between\nthe JPl devices. Two planes are dedicated for power, one for the +5 VDC and\nanother for the +/-12 VDC, Between the two power planes, the digital and the\nanalog ground plane is sandwiched. The two grounds are tied together at the two\nanalog-to-digital converter ground connection pins. The power and ground planes\nare not solid planes but are configured in a grid pattern to allow the printed circuit\nboard to flex. The analog signals to the analog-to-digital converters are embedded\nwithin the ground plane to shield the analog signals from the noisy digital lines.\nThe JPl has five resolver-to-digital (R/D), 16-bit, type-11 tracking converter\nchips, Analog Devices AD2S82JP, with analog velocity outputs. Two R/Ds are\nused for each of the pitch and yaw resolvers and one R/D is used for the wrist roll\nresolver. The pitch and yaw resolvers are two-speed (XI and X16) resolvers from\nVernitron Corporation. The reference frequency to the primary winding is 2-KHz\n7.5-Vrms signals and is supplied by the JPp board. The upper 4 bits from the 16bit word of the X1 winding R/D are used to give the correct sector out of the 16\nsectors that the resolver rotor can be located. The upper 12-bits from the 16-bit\nword of the X16 winding R/D are combined with the 4 bits of the X1 to give an\naccurate 16-bit position of the joint. Each R/D is tuned for its resolver and resolver\nwinding. The tuning circuits are discrete resistors and capacitors, not SMD devices,\nto allow rapid and easy retuning of the R/D circuits.\nThe JPl has two encoder chips, THCT2000FN from Texas Instruments, one\nfor each motor encoder. The two quadrature phase signals, A and B, from the\nmotor encoder controls the count direction of the 16-bit counter. The motor encoder\ngenerates 512 A and B pulse pairs per motor revolution, but the encoder chip will\ngenerate 4 counts per pulse pair for 2048 counts per motor revolution.\nThe joint module contains a torque sensor between the output of the motor\ngear reducer and the input preload mechanisms for each motor. The torque sensor\nreference voltage is +/-5VDC and is supplied from the JPp board. There is a highgain instrumentation amplifier for each of the torque sensors. The amplifiers are\nAnalog Devices AD524CE instrumentation amplifiers and are set to a fixed gain\nvalue with a single resistor. The amplifier output voltage can be nulled to zero\noutput voltage for a zero input voltage with a potentiometer.\nThe JPl has two high-speed 12-bit, 5 gs conversion analog-to-digital (A/D)\nconverters, Analog Devices AD7672KP05, with an input voltage range of +1-5\nVDC. A high-speed precision sample-and-hold amplifier, Analog Devices\nAD585JP, is on each A/D input. The inputs to both of the sample-and-hold\namplifiers are from a dual four-channel analog multiplexer, Analog Devices\nAD7502SE. The multiplexer inputs are a torque signal, a motor velocity from the\nmotor tachometer, and a joint velocity (either pitch or yaw) from an R/D. The\nfourth input to each of the dual analog multiplexer channels is from an eight-channel\nfault-protected analog multiplexer, Maxim MAX358CWE. One eight channel\nmultiplexer inputs can be the wrist roll velocity from the wrist roll R/D or the joint\nmodule temperatures or motor temperatures. The other eight channel multiplexer\nhas as its inputs the master manipulator hand controller signals. On each scan of the\njoint module data, only one channel of the eight-channel multiplexer is collected, or\n\non eight scans of collecting joint module data, a complete sct of the eight-channel\nmultiplexer data will be collected.\nThe JPI miscellaneous controls include the brake relay control, RS-232\ninterface, and JPI reset. The JPI controls the motor brakes with commands from the\nLP or, as a safety measure, locks the brakes upon loss of communication with the\nLP. The motor brake power is controlled by solid-state relays that are located on the\nJPp board. The JPI has an RS -232 interface similar to that on the LP to allow direct\ncommunications with the JPI for stand alone debugging purposes. The reset circuit\non the JPI also performs the same function as on the LP.\nThe JPI uses ten Du Pont Minitek connectors to connect the JPI to the\nsensors and to the JPp board. The connectors are located on the top side of the JPI\nand have crimp-to-wire contact on a 0.079 center and a very low profile to allow\nthe JPI to fit within the joint module. To allow testing of the JPI without removal\nfrom the joint module, test and caiibration signals that are only available on the\nunderside of the JPI are connected to unused pins on the connectors. This\nconfiguration allows the test and calibration signals to be available on the top of the\nJPI\nJOINT PROCESSOR POWER SUPPLY\nThe JPp is the power circuit for the JPI. It is a 2- by 7-in., double-sided\nprinted circuit board. 7 a JPp is supplied with +24 VDC from a power supply in\nthe cable breakout cabinet located at the base of the manipulator. The JPp uses three\nDC-DC 5-W converters to supply +5, +/-12 VDC onboard and to the JPI. The JPp\nalso supplies the 2-KHz resolver reference drive to the resolvers primary, and the\n+1-5 VDC reference signal to the two torque sensors. The fiber optic transceiver is\nmounted on the JPp . The motor brake\'s solid-state relays are located on the JPp\nbut are controlled by the JP1. The JPp is connected to the JPI and the resolver and\ntorque sensors with interface cables using Molex connectors.\nSURFACE - MOUNTED DEVICES\nSurface-mounted devices (SMDs) were used because of the space\nconstraints on the JPls and :LPs. SMDs included both IC chips and discrete\ncomponents, resistors and capacitors. The size of a SMD chip is approximately\none-fourth the size of a standard iC chip. SMD discrete components required only a\nsmall fraction of the circuit board area compared than would standard discrete\ncomponents. The soldering of SMD requires special soldering techniques. Three\ndifferent soldering techniques were used: hot air, vapor phase, and infrared.\nInfrared soldering was the most suczessful and was performed by an outside\ncontractor. The Instrumentation and Controls Division at ORNL performed any\nneeded repairs to the boards by using a hot air desoldering and soldering station.\nThe largest chip that had to be removed and replaced was a 68-pin microcontroller\nchip that had a bad I/O pin. There was no damage to either the circuit board or any\nnearby components.\nFIBER OPTIC SYSTEM\nThe Fiber Optic system consists of two full-duplex bidirectional transceivers\nand a single high-strength fiber for each Link and JPI pair. The LP transceiver is\nlocated in the VME computer system. rack and the JPI transceiver is located on its\n\npower supply board. The transceivers used are the CAF model manufactured by\nADC Telecommunications, Inc.. The transceiver use bidirectional, full-duplex\nsignal transmission over a single optic fiber. The transceiver is a self-contained,\ncircuit-board-mountable device that contains the transmitting LED, the receiving\nphotodetcctor, and the beam splitter. The transceivers are a matched pair which\nutilize two different light frequencies for receiving and transm\',tting. This\nconfiguration allows for full-duplex and bidirectional operation over a single fiber\noptic line. The optic fiber connects to the transceivers with SMA-type connectors.\nThe optic fiber used is the Ensign-Bickford Optics Company\'s "Avioptics"\ncable. The fiber is a 200/230-\xc2\xb5m hard clad, silica type with a proof test of 200 ksi\nand a numerical aperture of 0.37. The complete optic cable has a temperature range\nof -65 to 125 \' C, 10-mm-bend radius, and a tensile strength of 100 kg. This optic\ncable was selected because of the large fiber diameter for optic coupling and ease of\nworking with a high-proof test and a tight cable bend radius.\nThe fiber optic connectors that were used were manufactured by ITT\nCannon. The connectors used at the transceivers are of the SMA-type. Those used\nfrom the computers to the manipulators were Cannon\'s fiber optic multi-channel\nconnector (FOMC), and the connections between the joint modules were sprin gloaded connectors that fit within a coaxial "D" subminiature connector. he\nconnectors were selected because of their jewel alignment of the fiber. The jewel\nallows for very accurate fiber alignment between connectors that reduces the dB loss\nper connector. The connector loss is very important for LTM because there are\nseven connectors between the wrist JPl board and its LP board. Each connector end\nhas a precisely aligned jewel with a hole sized for the fiber/cladding diameter; for\nLTM, this diameter is 230 gm. The fiber is inserted into the jewel, epoxied, and the\nend is polished. The fiber optic system worked without problems, even though the\nsystem had many connectors, and continually flexing optic lines.\nELECTRICAL CABLING SYSTEM\nThe cabling of the manipulator system passes internally through both the\njoint module and the pitch-yaw differential ,joint of the module. Power cables are\nrequired for each manipulator motor PWM power, for the 24 VDC power to the JPp\nboard, and for separate 24 VDC power for the motor brakes. Power and signal\ncables are required for the hardwired deadman switch on the master hand controller.\nBecause of the small size of the joint differential and the number of cables still\nrequired to provide all of the signal and power -requirements of the manipulator, a\ncustom cable was designed and used. W. L. Gore manufactured a custom ribbon\ncable with 20 shielded, twisted, color-coded wire pairs. The diameter of one\nshielded, twisted wire pair is 0.10 in. The cable is designed for an excess of 1.\nmillion flexing operations inside the joint differential. The cables where terminated\nto high-density 52-pin "D" connectors. The connector size is that of a 25-pin "D"\nstandard connector. A system design requirement was that any joint module could\nbe used anywhere within the manipulator system. To meet this design requirement\nand to keep the cables to the minimutn number required, the cable design used offset\nconnector termination for the joint motor power and communications. This is a\ntechnique where the cables passing through the joint are not connected to the same\njoint bottom connector terminations as those used in the top connector, but the\nterminations are offset at the bottom connector to the same terminations to the next\njoint module\'s top connector terminations for motor power and communication.\nThis technique allows any joint module to serve as any manipulator joint without\nany change to the computer system.\n\nSAFETY INTERLOCK SYSTEM\nTo ensure personal and equipment safety, there is an interlock board in each\nmaster and slave computer system. The deadman switches on the master hand\ncontrollers are wired directly to the safety interlock b-:,ard and the operator must hold\nthe master hand controller grip to allow for system operation. Holding the hand\ncontroller enables the release of the motor brakes and enables the motor PWM\namplifiers in the master and slave manipulator pair. The computer system monitors\nthe deadman lines for system status and for commands to operate the brakes and\nPWM with the interlock board acting as a watchdog to the computer system. This\ndesign ensures a separate level of protection for personal and equipment safety\nindependent of the computer system. The safety interlock boards also monitor the\nsystem power supplies, and can lock the manipulators if any power supply fails.\nCONCLUSION\nThe solution to reducing the number of embedded cables for the LTM was\nsolved by using the custom-design data collection system. The electronics, optic,\nand power cabling hTve performed well since delivery to NASA. The rate of data\ncollection by the L P ,-,,nd JPl for each joint module for the LTM has been more than\nadequate for the control algorithms used. Future expansion of the LTM or new\nmanipulator designs could be improved with the use of Very Large Scale Integration\ndevices. The electronics packaging would be smaller, and reliability could improve\nbecause of the decreased number of components required.\nThe design of the electronics for the LP and JPI system could be used in\nmost modular manipulator designs or by designs that necessitate acquiring, sending,\nand collecting remote data by a VME-based computer system.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n1.
