An electrode array includes a number of electrodes which are arranged in pair, with the electrodes in each pair being spaced a particular distance apart. The array is driven by a balanced line system which is electromagnetically coupled to each pair of electrodes and which is shielded by a ground coaxial shield which itself is ground to the body of the patient. Each electrode is embedded in a Teflon stand-off in order to move the region of strong field, from the body, produced by rapidly changing potentials. The two pairs of electrodes forming a cross-like geometry are used with the balanced line systems. The electrical power is either multiplexed among the electrodes or the second pair is driven by a potential which is sinusoidal and which is 90% out of phase with the first balanced line system which is also sinusoidal.", "title": "Hyperthermia heating apparatus", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-04T15:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820026120, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gammell, P.
