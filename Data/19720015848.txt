During the time available the astronauts processed ii samples.\nThe evaluation of the demonstration samples w a s accomplished by comparing space\nprocessed (flight) samples with ( control) samples processed on the ground under otherwise\nsimilar conditions. In the low-g environment of space flight the dispersions of particles,\nfibers, and gases in a liquid metal matrix were maintained during solidification. Dispersions\nof normally immiscible liquids were also maintained during solidification.\n\n20.\n\nC L A S S I F . (of this report)\n\nUnclassified\nL\nMSFC\n\n.

The segregated structure may then be seen in the resolidified material. It has been postulated that such mixtures, in the very low-g\nenvironment of space flight, would remain stable in the liquid state and during\nfreezing so that novel material structures can be made.\n\nTo demonstrate this effect a composite casting demonstration was\nperformed on the Apollo 14 mission during the translunar and transearth\ncoast periods. The apparatus was simple and light, It consisted of an electric\nheater with a controlled maximum internal temperature of 385.93OK (235OF)\nand of a heat sink device for cooling. The I 1 samples were contained in\nstandard sealed cartridges and were processed sequentially by the astronauts.\nSome of the materials in the cartridges had been premixed, others had to be\nmixed after melting by a prescribed method of manual shaking. The materials\nwere carefully chosen after extended studies; they were intended to model the\nreduced gravity effects which would be expected to occur in other more directly\nuseful materials. The choice of these materials and the heater design were\ndictated primarily by considerations of simplicity of operation, weight, power\nconsumption, maximum touch temperature, toxicity, flammability, availability\nof prior applicable knowledge about the metal system, and simplicity of preparation as a flight sample.\nOwing to the weight and astronaut time limitations, only one sample\nof each composition was flown.\nThe evaluation of the demonstration samples was performed by\ncomparing space processed (flight) samples with (control) samples processed\non the ground under otherwise similar conditions. The evaluations were performed using radiography, macroscopic and microscopic analysip of the\n\nsurface features and of sections, analysis of fractures, density determination,\nand other customary laboratory techniques as w e l l as statistical and theoretical analyses. The evaluation procedures as well as the processing methods\nwere developed on early lldevelopment samples".\nThe results obtained from the. evaluation of three sets of samples may\nbe summarized as follows:\nI. Premixed Samples. The samples were precompressed metal\npowder compacts containing 30 percent (vol) of dispersed non-melting particles.\nIn one pair (flight and control samples) a more uniform distribution of particles w a s observed in the flight sample. The results from the second pair of\nsamples proved inconclusive because only partial melting had taken place in\nthe flight sample. In both pairs, distinct differences in surface features were\nobserved between control and flight samples apparently owing to the predominant influence of surface tension effects under reduced gravity.\n2. Samples with Fibers o r Particles and/or Gas Added to Matrix.\nThese samples were hand-shaken for mixing. From a comparison of the\ncontrol and the flight samples the following conclusions were reached:\n\nThe flight samples had markedly enhanced dispersion and uniformity\no distribution of gases and non-melting dispersants even though, in some\nf\ninstances, the dispersant had non-wetting characteristics; the use of a dispersant appears to enhance the retention of gases; there were marked differences in surface features between control and flight samples - apparently the\nflight samples tended to "free float" within the capsules and hence assume\nshapes dictated by surface tension effects.\n3. Samples with Two and Three Phase Immiscible Mixtures. (The\nthird phase, when present, w a s gas o r tungsten spheres.) These samples\nwere mixed by manual shaking after melting. The following results were\nobserved when comparing the flight with the control samples:\n\na. Stable dispersions exist in all three flight samples.\nb. The dispersions range from very fine to relatively coarse.\nc. A l l such dispersions are unstable on earth and hence are not\nobserved in the control samples.\nd. The dispersions were not homogeneous: this is attributed to the\nrelatively primitive mixing procedure by hand shaking and to the thermal\ngradients existing during solidification.\n\n2\n\n4. General Observations on A l l Demonstrations: Owing to the "free\nfloat" condition under low-g conditions, the thermal contact of the melt with the\ncontainer was intermittent and uncontrolled. Hence the melting and particularly the solidification processes were not the same for the flight and the\ncontrol samples. This is evidenced by unusual metallographic structures in\nseveral flight samples.\nIn the detailed reports from the investigators, recommendations for new\no r improved experiments are made to answer questions raised by the present\ndemonstrations. Conclusions are also drawn as to the significance of these\ndemonstrations for the Space Manufacturing program.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe use of the weightless environment of space flight for manufacturing\nunique materials and products was suggested several years ago\'.\nPresuming the absence of buoyancy and of thermal convection in zero g\nit was postulated that materials of different densities mixed in the liquid state\nwould not segregate and that such a dispersion could be maintained during\ncooling and solidification2. This report describes demonstrations of this effect\nusing simple apparatus, and materials which are intended as models only.\nThe purpose of the composite casting demonstration was to obtain p r e liminary data on the processes of melting, mixing, and solidification of composite materials. Composite casting is defined as the casting of a material\nfrom a mixture of a liquid matrix and solid reinforcements such as whiskers,\nparticles, o r fibers. A variation of composite casting is obtained when gas\nis added to form foam material (which may also be reinforced by whiskers,\netc., if desired) . Another variation is obtained when normally immiscible\nliquid materials are dispersad one in the other and solidified.\nL\n\nThe composite casting process had been identified in a previous study\n[I] a process which made the most direct application of the presumed\nas\nzero-g phenomena and one where an early demonstration could be performed.\nI National Aeronautics and Space Administration , Mimufactwing Tech.\nnology Unique to Zero-Gravity Environment, Marshall Space Flight Center\nMeeting, Huntsville, Alabama, November 1968.\n2.\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, Space Processing and\nManufacturing, Marshall Space Flight Center Meeting, Huntsville, Alabama,\nOctober 21, 1969.\n\n3\n\nThe data presented in this report were derived from a comparison of\nsamples processed in space with those processed on earth under otherwise\nsimilar conditions.\nThe extended zero g available during the transearth coasting phase\nof an Apollo mission was seen as an opportunity to give an early demonstration\nof the postulated effects on materials processing in an environment where\ngravity is reduced to a very small value.\nApproval was given in September 1970 to proceed with the design and\ndevelopment of an in-flight demonstration of composite casting and analysis\nfor compatibility with Apollo 1 .\n4\nThe demonstration apparatus was designed and developed by the\nProcess Engineering Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) ,\nwith consulting help on selection of sample materials provided by General\nDynamics Convair Division and A. D. Little, Inc,, under contracts NAS8-24979\nand NAS8-26637 respectively. Other contributors to the selection of samples\nwere Astronautics Laboratory, Space Sciences Laboratory, and Research\nPlanning Office at MSFC, and Cornel1 Aeronautical Laboratory and TRW\nSystems Group. The Quality and Reliability Laboratory performed all qualification and acceptance tests with the support of Astronautics Laboratory for\nflammability and shock tests. All required reviews, plans, and documentation\nwere accomplished and approved and the hardware fabricated and delivered\nto Kennedy Space Center by December 10, 1970.\n\nDEMONSTRAT ION APPARATUS AND PROCEDURES\nThe apparatus consisted of an electrical heater, a storage box for the\nheater which also served as a heat sink for cooling the samples to touch\ntemperature before removal, and 18 samples contained in hermetically sealed\nmetal capsules. A beta cloth bag resembling a cartridge belt was used to\nstore the 18 sample capsules.\nProcedures called for inserting each capsule into the heater as shown\nin Figure I, heating for a prescribed time to melt the capsule contents,\nshaking in some cases to mix the materials, and cooling by placing the heater\nand capsule onto the heat sink as shown in Figure 2 . The right half of the\naluminum storage box was a massive section of aluminum with an integrally\nmachined heat sink pin which made contact with the specimen capsule.

Composite casting heater on heat sink.\n\n6\n\nbetter view of the heat sink pin is seen in Figure I A bayonet type connection\n.\nwas made between the heater and the pin; the spring in the upper cap held the\ncapsule tightly against the heat sink.\nThe heater operated on 27.5 V, DC from the Command Module power\nbus using the Data Acquisition Camera power cable. Connection was made\nat a utility receptacle, and a switch on the panel was used to switch the heater\non and off. Nominal power consumption for the heater was 34 W. A cross\nsection of the heater with a sample capsule inside is shown in Figure 3.\nRedundant thermal switches were installed to insure that the outside surfaces\nof the heater did not exceed 313.65"K (105\xc2\xb0F) The maximum temperature\nreached by the capsule after 10 min of heating was approximately 385.95"K\n(235\xc2\xb0F) . Cooling times of no less than 30 min on the heat sink reduced the\ntemperature of the capsules to less than 310.95\'K (100" F) .\n\n.\n\nAn abbreviated form of the procedures followed by the astronauts is\nshown in Figure 4. Where applicable, the shaking procedure was as follows:\nThe shaking procedure used after melting the samples involved bumping\neach end of the heater against the heel of the hand 4 times to dislodge any\nparticles trapped in the ends of the capsule; 3 cycles of alternately shaking\nthe heater axially 10 times, oscillating in a rotary motion 15 times; and\nfinishing by oscillating 10 times going from a vigorous motion to very slow.\nTests with model systems in transparent models showed this to be the best\nmixing procedure under the circumstances. A mechanical device would have\nbeen preferred to obtain a more vigorous, controlled mixing; however, the\ndevelopment and integration of such a device into the demonstration was not\npossible in the time available.\n\nL\n\nDuring translunar and transearth coasts, 11 of the 18 samples were\nprocessed. Sample No. 10 was heated at least twice because Reaction\nControl System (RCS) firings occurred during the first cooling cycle, Several\nRCS firings occurred at approximately 15 min into the cooling cycle on Sample\nNo. 12; however, the sample was not reheated because of mission constraints.\nThe astronauts reported that the heater performed well and that there were\nno problems with the procedures. Postflight tests of the heater showed that\nits performance was still within specifications.\nThe sample capsules and heater were held in quarantine with the\nCommand Module until April 5, 1971, when they were removed and returned\nto MSFC for evaluation.\n\n7\n\nL\n\nFigure 3 .

All sample\nmaterials were required to meet Apollo specifications for toxicity, odor,\nand flammability although they were sealed in metal capsules.\nTwo types of matrix materials were considered for the demonstration:\n( I a metal o r alloy and (2) a transparent o r translucent inorganic o r\n)\norganic material which would serve as a model for a crystalline metal\nmatrix. Both types of matrix material were required to have a melting\ntemperature below 349.85" K ( 170" F) and above 313.65" K ( 105\xc2\xb0F) Evaluation of a variety of matrix materials and reinforcements was carried out\nconcurrently inhouse and by contractors. A. D. Little, Inc. was engaged for\nthe evaluation of candidate nonmetallic materials, and General Dynamics/\nConvair for the evaluation of candidate metallic materials. Inhouse investigations using primarily metallic materials were directed mainly towards the\ndevelopment of processing techniques.\n\n.\n\nEvaluation of Candidate Nonmetallic Matrix Materials\nA . D. Little considered several types of materials as candidates for\nthe matrix including inorganic salt hydrates, salt eutectics, fluorocarbons,\norganic phosphates and silicates, and low-melting organics. The principal\ncriteria for selection of materials were:\n\na. Mdting point below 349.85OK (170OF)e\nb.\n\nLow toxicity.\n\nc.\n\nLow flammability.\n\nd.\n\nLow vapor pressure.\n\ne. Readily available ( preferably flight approved materials) ,\nf.\n\nGood model for crystalline metal matrix.\n\ng. Transparent, if possible.\n\n10\n\nh. Significant density difference between matrix and reinforcing\nmaterials.\ni. Wetting of reinforcing materials by matrix.\nj\n\n.\n\nChemical and physical compatibility of matrix material, reinforcing\nmaterial and container.\n\nAfter an initial screening of the candidate matrix materials, A. D.\nLittle selected cobalt nitrate, tri-p-tolylphosphate, decafluorobiphenyl, and\nbenzophenone for laboratory screening tests. A list of the materials screened\nand the details of the screening tests performed on the four candidates are\nreported in Reference 2. On the basis of their screening tests, cobalt nitrate\nwas selected as the most acceptable material and decafluorobiphenyl as the\nnext most promising. The melting points of cobalt nitrate and decafluorobiphenyl are 330.35OK ( 135O F ) and 341.45OK ( 155" F ) respectively.\n\nIn addition to their investigations of metallic matrix materials, General\nDynamics/Convair also considered nonmetallic materinls for a transparent\nmatrix. They screened a number of candidate materials and recommended\nBurton& 44, a saccharide, as a candidate. Details of their evaluation are\nreported in Reference 5 . A solution of I. 5 percent Burtonite 44 in water has\na melting temperature of 319.25OK ( 1 1 5 \xc2\xb0 F ) and a density of I. 0 g/cm3. It is\ntransparent as a solid and a liquid. The primary disadvantage of the Burtonite\nsolution was the danger of boiling and hence of increased pressure within the\nspecimen capsule when the temperature reaches 373.15OK ( 2 1 2 O F ) .\n\nI the final selection of a nonmetallic matrix material, cobalt nitrate\nn\nand decafluorobiphenyl were ruled out because of lack of time to complete\ntoxicity and flammability tests. Burtonite 44 was ruled out because of its\nlow boiling temperature and the difficulty in handling the jelly-like material.\nParaf\xe2\x82\xacin, which had been recommended for the immiscible materials demonstrations, was finally selected although it did not satisfy the criteria of transparency and has a high rate of shrinkage upon solidification. It is translucent\nand provides more visibility of the dispersed reinforcing materials than the\nmetallic matrix materials.\n\nEva I uat ion of Ca ndidate Meta I Iic Matr ix Mater ia I s\nInitially investigations were limited to a group of bismuth-based\neutectic alloys made by Cerro Copper and Brass Company.

Subsequently Cerrobend was eliminated as a matrix material\nbecause of the toxicity of the cadmium it contains. A 66 percent indium, 34\npercent bismuth eutectic alloy was substituted. In-Bi has a density of 8 . 0 g/cm3\nand a melting point of 345.15"K (162\xc2\xb0F) . In-Bi has characteristics similar\nto those of Cerrobend except for its strength.

Limited investigations\nof reinforcement materials were made by A . D. Little. The candidate materials included:\n\na. Chopped metal wires.\nb. Chopped glass filaments.\nc.\n\n12\n\nChopped boron filaments.\n\nd. Whiskers.\n\ne. Metallic particles.\nf . Oxide particles.\nThe criteria for selection of reinforcement materials and surface\ntreatments were:\n\na. Chemical compatibility with matrix.\nb. Wetting by the liquid matrix.\nc. Adherence of the solid matrix to the reinforcement.\nd. High bond strength between reinforcement and solidified matrix.\ne. High reinforcement material strength relative to matrix.\nf. Significant density difference between matrix and reinforcement.\n\nInitially experiments were conducted with the Cerrobend matrix and a\nselection of most reinforcements was a result of those experiments. After\nthe matrix was changed to In-Bi, additional tests were made to verify the\nselections.\nThe metallic wires tested were copper, stainless steel, carbon steel,\ngalvanized steel, music wire, beryllium-copper. No chemical compatibility\nproblems were found except with galvanized wires. Various surface treatments, including coatings of various metals and use of fluxes, were evaluated\nto determine the combination of wire and surface treatment which would give\ngood wetting and adherence. The copper and beryllium-copper wires proved\nto give the best wetting and adherence with the least surface treatment. Singlefiber bond strength tests were carried out by casting single filaments into the\nmatrix at various depths. Copper and beryllium-copper wires gave the best\nresults and coating with Cerrobend improved the shear strength considerably.\nBeryllium-copper wire was chosen because of the high strength, good wetting,\nand high bond strength with the matrix.\nChopped glass filaments were eliminated because of their poor wetting\nand bonding characteristics.\n\n13\n\nBoron filaments showed good single filament shear strengths with\nthe matrix, probably due to the rough surface of the filament; however, wetting\nwas poor and could not be improved by surface treatment. Coating of the\nboron filament with copper promoted wetting and adherence; however, a\nreliable process could not be worked out in the time available to coat adequate\nquantities of the chopped filaments.\nSapphire and silicon carbide whiskers proved to be satisfactory when\ncoated with copper.\nThe use of oxide microparticles such as aluminum oxide to improve\ncreep resistance and to control grain growth, size, and structure was\nabandoned because problems which were encountered when attempting to\ndisperse the fine powders into the metal matrix could not be solved in time.\nMetallic microparticles of tungsten and boron carbide were acceptable\nprovided they were coated with bright copper.\n\nFinal Selection of Sample Materials\nThe research performed inhouse and by the contractors was reviewed\nand a final selection of the sample materials made in late November 1970.\nThe composite materials samples selected for the Apollo 14 inflight\ndemonstration were divided into four general classifications:\na. Precompressed metal powder compacts with dispersed nonmelting particles.\nb. Matrix materials in combination with various non-melting particles, fibers, whiskers and/or gas.\ne. Dispersions of immiscible materials (both melting) ,\n\nd. Solidification and casting demonstrations.\nBecause of lack of time during the flight, none of the samples in the\ngroup D was processed. Only I 1 of the 18 flight samples were processed.\nA list of these 11 samples is shown in Table I A more detailed description\n.\nfollows.\n\n14\n\n__\nh\n\nh\n\nP\n\nP\n\nM\n\nc\n\n.r(\n\nm\nm\n\na\n,\n0\n\nE\n\nPI\n\nu\n\ni\n!\n0\nh\n\n3\n\na,\n\nE!\n\n2\n\nP\n\nR\n\nB\n8\n0\nk\n\na\n\na\n\na\n,\n0\n\n..\n\nP\n\nM\n\nm\n\nk\n\nc)\n\nc\na,\n\nc)\n\ng\nV\n\n2\n\nd\n\n0\n\na,\n0\nM\n\nIEi\nc)\n\nc\n\ng\nk\n\na\n,\n\na\n0\n\nc-\n\na\n,\n\na\n\nm\n\n.\n\nN\n\nk\n\na\n,\n\na\n\nE PI\nE\nPI\ni$\n\nk\n\nd\n\nm\n\nN\n\ns\n\nu\n\n8\n0\nk\n\na\n,\n\nP\n\n0\n\nc-\n\nk\n\n;a\n\nm\n\nB\n\nY\n\n\\\n\n3\n\n%\n\n\\\n\ny q .q\nc\nH\n\n2\nu\n8\n0\n\nfi\n\nc\nH\n\nc)\n\nU\n\nc\na\n,\n\nG\n\nk\na\n,\n\na\n,\n0\nk\na,\n\nm\n\nm\n\n0\n\na\n\nc-\n\na\n\nc-\n\na,\n\na\n\n8\nu\n8\n0\nk\n\na\n,\n\na\n\nm\n\nN\n\ns\n\n\\\n\ni\n3\n\ni$ F5.\'\n.r(\n\ng\nk\n\n0\n\na\n\nk\n\na\n,\n\na\n\n0\n\nm\n\nc-\n\na\nm\n\nc-\n\n3\n\na\n\nd\n\n0\n\n0\n\nm\n\n*\n\nd\n4\n$\n\nc\na,\n0\n\na\n,\n\na\n\n*\n0\n\n(4"\n\nc)\n\nu\n\na,\n\nk\na,\n\nk\n\nk\n\n0\n\nm\n\nk\n\na,\n\n\\\n\na,\n\nU\n\nu\n\nk\n\na\n\ni\n\n0\nk\n\n0\n:\na,\n0\nk\n\nu\n\nu\n\na\n,\n\nd\n\nc\n\n.a,\n\n3\nR\n\nk\n\nU\n\nk\n\nN\n\nc)\n\nPI\n\nIEi\n\nU\n\n8\n0\n\nu\n\nR\n\nPI\n\n$\n\nfi\n\n8\n\n3 i\n\nm\n\n.\n\na\n\nd\ns\n1\n\nm\n\nIEi\n0\n\n0\nN\n\nN\n\na\n,\n\nB\nu\n8\n0\n\nk\n\na\n,\n\na\n\nc\n\n2\n\nc)\n\n8\n0\n\na\n,\n\nP\nu\n\n2 u\n8 u c\n8 8\nk\nk\n0\n\nU\n\n24\n\n8\n0\na\n\nc-\n\nc\n\ng\n\ncd\nk\ncd\n\nPi\n\n8\n0\n\ne\nc-\n\nd\n\ncd\n\n8\n0\n\na\n,\n\na\n\n0\n\nm\n\ncd\n\n8\n0\n\nc\n\na\n,\n0\n\nk\n\na\n,\n\na,\n\n*\n\n0\n\na\n\n0\n\na\n\n*\n\nl-l\n\nm\n\nk\na\n,\n\n3\na\n\nI\n\nok\na\n\na,\n\n4\n\na\n\nE\n\ncd\nrn\n\n15\n\nPreparation of Samples\nA ground control, flight, and spare for each of the samples was\nprepared. All were prepared at MSFC with the exception of the powder\ncompacts. The procedures followed in preparing the I 1 samples are given\nblow.\nPrecompressed Powder Compacts. The powder compacts for these\nsamples were prepared by Cornel1 Aeronautical Laboratory. The detailed\nprocedures for preparing these samples is given in Reference 4 A brief\n.\ndescription of these procedures follows.\n:\nSample I 70 Percent In-Bi Powder, 30 Percent Tungsten Particles (by\nVolume) . A mixture of 30 vol percent spherical copper-coated tungsten\nparticles and 70 vol percent In-Bi eutectic powders was compressed to form a\npowder compact. The In-Bi powders and tungsten particles were of the same\nsize, -325 mesh. The In-Bi powders were leached in a 3-percent solution\nof hydrochloric acid to remove oxides. The copper-coated tungsten pa&icles\nwere heated in a hydrogen atmosphere to reduce oxides. The powders were\nweighed out, placed in a sealed container, and mixed for 4 h r to obtain a\nrandom distribution. The mixed powders were then compressed in a double\n.\nn\nacting die to form a powder compact I74 cm i diameter and 7.6 c m long\nwith a theoretical density of 96 percent.\n\nSample 2: 70 Percent In-Bi Powder, 30 Percent Boron Carbide Particles (by Volume) A mixture of 30 vol percent spherical copper-coated boron\ncarbide ( B4C) particles and 70 vol percent In-Bi eutectic powders w a s compressed to form a powder compact. The B4C particles and In-Bi powders were\nof the same size, -325 mesh. The particles and powders were processed in\nthe same manner as the contents of Sample I. The mixed powders were compressed to form a compact 1.74 cm in diameter and 2.5 c m long with a theoretical density of 89 percent. In trying to compress compact to this lower density,\ni t w a s impossible to make one long enough to f i l l the capsule. Therefore, three\ncompacts of the stated size were used in each eapsule.\n\n.\n\nNote: Each sample w a s inserted into standard aluminum capsule which w a s\nthen sealed by electron beam welding.\n\n16\n\nlVIatrix Materials with Fibers, Particles, Whiskers and/or G a s\n\nSample 4: 71 Percent In-Bi, 4 Percent S i c Whiskers, 25 Percent\nArgon (by Volume) Approximately 1.5 g of copper-coated S i c whiskers\n(1-10 p &am. x 20-400 p long) and 90 g of liquid In-Bi were premixed,\npoured into a heated aluminum capsule, and allowed to solidi%. The actual\nwhisker content amounted to approximately 4.0 percent by volume.\n\n.\n\n1\n\nSample. 5: 68 Percent In-Bi, 7 Percent BeCu Fibers, 25 Percent\nArgon (by Volume). The sample was prepared by placing approximately\n7 g of Cerrobend coated beryllium-copper fibers (. 13 mm diam. x 2.5 mm\nlong) into a heated aluminum capsule and then pouring in approximately 97 g\nof In-Bi eutectic. The actual fiber content amounted to approximately 6. 6\npercent by volume.\nSample 7: 75 Percent In-Bi, 25 Percent Argon (by Volume). The\nsamples consisted of 75 vol percent In-Bi and 25 vol percent argon gas. The\nsample was prepared by pouring approximately 100 g of molten In-Bi into a\npreheated capsule and inserting a preheated stainless steel mixing screen\nwhile the In-Bi was molten.\nSample 8: 67 Percent In-Bi, 8 Percent Tungsten Particles, 25 Percent\nArgon (by Volume). The sample was prepared by pouring approximately\n21 g of copper-coated spherical tungsten particles (approximately 100 p d i m . )\ninto a preheated aluminum capsule and then adding approximately 99 g of\nmolten In-Bi eutectic. The actual particle content amounted to approximately\n8. 2 percent by volume.\nSample 10: 70 Percent In-Bi, 30 Percent Tungsten Particles (by\nVolume). Approximately 105 g of copper-coated spherical tungsten particles\n( 100 p diam. ) were placed in a preheated capsule, a tungsten mixing pellet\nadded, and then 100 g of In-Bi eutectic poured into the capsule. The actual\nparticle content mounted to approximately 30. 4 percent by volume.\nSample 11: 68 Percent Paraffin, 7 Percent BeCu Fibers, 25 Percent\nArgon (by Volume). Approximately 7 g of Cerrobend-coated BeCu fibers were\nplaced in a preheated capsule, and 10 g of paraffin were then poured into the\ncapsule. The actual fiber content was approximately 6 . 7 percent by volume.\nNote: After cooling and solidification of the sample, each capsule was\nevacuated, backfilled with argon, if required, and sealed by electron beam\nwelding.\n\n17\n\nImmiscible Mate rials\nSample 6: 50 Percent Paraffin, 50 Percent Sodium Acetate (by Volume) ,\nSample 9 40 Percent Paraffin, 40 Percent Sodium Acetate, 20 Percent\n:\nArgon (by Volume).\nSample 12: 40 Percent Paraffin, 40 Percent Acetate, 20 Percent\nTungsten Spheres (by Volume).\nPreparation w a s similar in all cases except for the addition of argon\nin Sample 9 and the 100-pm spherical tungsten particles in Sample 12. The\nprocedures used were as follows:\nThe sodium acetate trihydrate w a s prepared by melting at 341.15" K\nThe melted,\nfiltered sodium acetate trihydrate w a s then poured into a preheated capsule\nto the desired level and the tungsten mixing pellet added. In Sample 12, the\ntungsten particles w e r e added at this point. Then melted paraffin w a s added\nto the desired level and allowed to solidify, A needle w a s used to puncture\nthe paraffin to admit air for equalization of pressure to insure solidification\nof the sodium acetate. It w a s discovered that sodium acetate has a tendency\nto supercool at lowered vapor pressures caused by the solidification shrinkage\nin a sealed container. This phenomenon deserves further explanation, which\nshould be given before future use of this material as a model matrix is\nrecommended. A t this point Sample 9 w a s backfilled with argon.\n( 154.4OF) and then filtering to remove any unmelted crystals.\n\nNote: A l l capsules were sealed by electron beam welding.\n\nSAMPLE EVALUATION AND RESULTS\nThe evaluation plans provided that one half of each sample, flight and\nground processed control, would be delivered to a contractor investigator and\nthe other half retained at MSFC for evaluation. Contractor participation in\nthe evaluation w a s as follows:\nCornel1 Aeronautical Laboratory\n\nSamples I 2 , and 10 [41\n,\n\nArthur D. Little, Inc.\n\nSamples 4, 7, and 8 [ 21\n\nGeneral Dynamic s-C onvair\n\nSamples 5 and I 1 [ 31\n\nTRW Systems\n\nSamples 6, 9, and 12 [ 51\n\nL\n\nPreliminary evaluation of all samples w a s conducted a t MSFC with the\ncontractors present during evaluation of the samples assigned to them. Preliminary evaluation included:\n\na. Radiography of the unopened capsules to show the distribution of\nsample materials within the capsule.\nb. Opening of the capsules.\n\n.\n\nc Documentation (photography, weighing, measuring, etc. ) and\nidentification of the sample.\nd. Longitudinal halving of the samples.\ne. Additional photographs of the halved samples.\nAdditionally for those samples containing argon gas, the capsules\nwere accurately weighed to 0. I before opening; the capsules were then\nmg\npierced and reweighed. By comparing weights before and after piercing, it\nwas determined whether the gas had been retained during the welding process.\nA summary of the results of the detailed evaluation of the samples\nfollows :\n\nPrecompressed Powder Compacts Containing Dispersed Particles\nThe primary objective for processing this group of samples was to\nobserve the redistribution of particles in a powder metal matrix melted and\nsolidified in a weightless environment. The density of the non-melting\nSigniparticles differed significantly from that of the matrix (approx. 1/2.5)\nficant segregation of particles had been expected when the samples were\nmelted under gravity.\n\n.\n\nProcessing of specimens in this group was accomplished by placing\nthe sample capsule in the heater, heating for 10 min to melt the In-Bi matrix,\nand cooling on the heat sink for 30 min. The ground control samples were\nheated in the horizontal position and cooled in the vertical position. A temperature profile, Figure 5, taken during processing of ground control Sample I\nshows that the matrix was molten after about 6 min and was solidified after\nabout 20 min. None of these samples was shaken.\n\n19\n\n20\n\nA comprehensive report on characterization of the samples in this\n.\ngroup is given in Reference 4 Only a summary of those studies and results\nis given here.\n\nSample I: 70 Percent In-Bi, 30 Percent Tungsten Powder Compact.\nTungsten particle distributions were investigated in three sample half sections\nidentified as:\nDevelopmental Sample, ID-A-00, in the as-pressed condition.\nControl Sample, IC-A-00, melted and solidified under gravity.\nFlight Sample, IF-A-00, melted and solidified under near zero g.\nProcedure for Determining Tungsten Particle Distribution. The\ndistribution of tungsten particles w a s determined by the following procedure:\na. The exposed planes were mechanically polished to produce a\nsurface of particles and matrix.\nb. Photomicrographs (IOOX) of the prepared surfaces were taken\nat intervals in both the directional ( longitudinal) and cross-directional ( radial)\ndirections. Figure 6 shows the typical method used in documenting the particle\ndistributions.\nc. The IOOX photomicrographs were enlarged 2.5 times to produce\nlarge negatives [ 22.23 x 28. 58 cm (8.75 x 11.25 in.)]\nParticle distribution w a s determined by superimposing a I-cm-ruled grid on vellum over\nthe negative and marking with a pencil each grid point occupied by a particle.\nThe total number of occupied points divided by the total number of points gave\nthe volume percent of particles for the particular area.\n\n.\n\nd. The data w a s then plotted to show particle distribution in both\ndirectional ( longitudinal) and cross directional ( transverse) directions for\neach sample.\nTungsten Particle Distribution. The directional display of tungsten\nparticle distribution in the three samples is shown in Figure 7. Because of\nthe method of compaction, the tungsten particle distribution in the "as-pressed"\nsample w a s not uniform. There w a s a noticeable decrease in particle density\nat the ends of the developmental sample (Fig. 8) In the cross-directional\n( transverse) direction distribution shows the particle content to be consistently\nlower at the edges than a t the center. Data taken along the center axis compared very well with the directional data.\n\n.\n\n21\n\nC\n\nQ\n\nz\n\nW\n\nI\n-\n\na\n\nW\n\nI\n\nK\n\nQ\n\nCn\n\n4\na09\nmc!\n\nY\n\nz\n\n\xe2\x82\xac0\n\nI\n-\n\na\nr\nW\n\nE\n0\n\nz\n2\n\n-\n\n0\n\nh\n\nr\n\nY\n2\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\noz\n\n23\n\nFigure 8. Developmental Sample 1 ( 1D-A-00) directional display,\nphotomicrograph, (lOOX).\nIn the control sample there w a s an increase in particle density toward\nthe center of the sample and toward the heat sink (gravity direction) Abrupt\nand large changes in volume percent tungsten indicate that some particle\nsettling started but complete segregation did not occur. It w a s thought that\nthis w a s due to the limited time above the melting temperature while in the\nvertical position. However, subsequent tests performed at MSFC (Appendix)\nhave shown that complete segregation does not occur after prolonged heating\nin the vertical position. The mechanisms which prevent segregation are not\nunderstood. The method of processing the ground control sample may have\nfurther disturbed the distribution. It w a s melted in the horizontal position\nand then moved to the vertical position for cooling. Therefore a settling\npattern as shown in Figure 9 may have occurred. The orientation of the sample\nduring heating with respect to the cutting plane is not known.\n\n.\n\nIn the flight sample, a more homogeneous distribution of particles w a s\nseen in the longitudinal display. This display w a s the result of an actual count\n\n24\n\n0\n\n5\n1\na\n\n0\n\nL;;\nY\n\n0\n\nr!\nm\n2\n\n0\nc\nz\n\nW\n\nfn\nW\n\ne\nW\n\nK\n\nfn\nW\n1\n\n0\nc\nK\n\na\n4\n\nE\n\nfn\nl\n-\n\nc)\n\nz\nI2\n~\n\n..\n\nz\n0\nX\n\n25\n\ntaken at 15 different locations along the axis. A s seen in Figure 7, the concentration of tungsten particles was very nearly constant at 30 vol percent which\nwas the initial concentration. Good correlation was obtained between the cross\ndirectional data at the intersection of the center axis and that taken in the\ndirectional display along the axis.\nSurface Features. In comparing the surfaces of the samples in contact\nwith the capsule wall, some interesting differences were noted between the\nappearance of the control sample and the flight sample. Surface distortions\no r depressed regions were seen in the flight samples and not in the control\nsamples (Figs. 10 and 11) It was postulated that these depressed regions\nwere the result of bubbles or voids moving to the surface of the sample and the\ninteraction between the tungsten particles and associated void volumes.\n\n.\n\nSample 2: 70 Percent In-Bi, 30 Percent B4C Powder Compact. Three\nsamples were again evaluated:\nDevelopmental Sample, 2D-A-00, as pressed.\nControl Sample , 2C-A-00,\n\nmelted and\' solidified under gravity.\n\nFlight Sample, 2F-A-00, melted and solidified under near zero g.\nThese samples were evaluated in the same manner as Sample I.\nThe control and flight samples consist of three individual segments. Upon\nremoval from the capusles , the three segments remained separate indicating\nthat complete melting had not occurred. Some melting was evident in the\nsegment at the bottom or heat sink end of the samples in that some metal had\nflowed from the compact. More metal had flowed from the flight sample than\nfrom the control sample. The distribution of the B4C particles in two segments\nof the flight samples was different from the developmental sample indicating\nthat some melting had occurred (Fig. 12).\nS u m m a n of Group A Results. The distribution of tungsten particles\nin Sample I was determined quantitatively using a point-intercept method.\nThe results obtained indicate the following:\na. When compared with the development sample, it was found that\na redistribution of tungsten particles had occurred after melting in both the\ncontrol and flight samples.\n\n26\n\nL\n\nFigure I O .

The distribution obtained in flight Sample 1was more uniform than\nthat obtained in control Sample I. This indicates that there are advantages to\nbe gained in liquid-phase sintering in the absence of gravity forces. This also\nhas implications for the composite casting processes.\nThe distinct differences in surface features of the control and flight\nsample indicate differences in bubble/void motion and interaction between\nbubbles/voids and particles in zero g compared with gravity conditions.\nAdditional experiments may be warranted to determine what mechanisms are\nat work and the implications f o r space manufacturing.\nThe quantitative data on Sample 2 are obscured by the evidence of\nincomplete melting; however, it seems that in those segments which had\npartially melted, the distribution of B,C particles tended towards greater\nuniformity.\n\nMatrix Material w i t h Fibers, Particles, Whiskers andlor Gas.\nThe primary objectives in processing this group of samples w a s to\ndemonstrate the dispersion of high and low-density solid reinforcements and/\no r gases in a liquid phase matrix and the stability of such mixtures during\nsolidification in a near weightless environment.\nProcessing of the flight and ground control samples in this group w a s\naccomplished by placing the capsule containing the sample in the heater,\nheating for 10 min to melt the matrix, shaking by hand to disperse the solids\nand gases in the liquid, and cooling on the heat sink for 30 min.\nSample 4: 71 Percent In-Bi, 4 Percent Sic Whiskers, 25 Percent\nArgon. The objective w a s to achieve a stable dispersion of nonmetallic\nwhiskers and gas bubbles in a metal matrix through processing in a weightless\nenvironment.\nRadiographs of the unopened control and flight samples are shown in\nFigure 13. The down direction for the control sample, and the heat sink\nposition in both cases, is at the bottom of the picture. The solid is in contact\nwith the capsule walls and bottom in the control sample. The flight sample\nis in contact with both ends of the capsule. There is a minor neck near the\nheat sink end and a major neck at the opposite end where there is no contact\nwith the capsule walls. This w a s verified upon removal of the sample from\nthe capsule (Fig. 14) . Both ends of the flight sample and one end of the\ncontrol sample were shiny, indicating contact with the capsule.\n\n30\n\nControl\n4c\n\nFlight\n4F\n\nFigure 13. X-ray radiographs, Samples 4C and 4F.\nThe sample w a s sectioned longitudinally and metallographically\nprepared. The most significant difference between the flight and control\nsamples is seen in Figure 15. Approximately the bottom fifth of the control\nsample was fully dense with no Sic whiskers o r argon bubbles. In contrast,\nthe flight sample w a s uniform throughout, both in microstructure and in\ndistribution of gas pores.\nPore density and pore-size distribution measurements were performed\nto evaluate differences between the flight and control samples. The flight\nsample had a pore density approximately twice that of the control sample.\nFurthermore, the pore density of the flight sample w a s rather uniform, varying\nfrom 16 percent near the bottom to 19 percent a t the top. In contrast, the\ncontrol sample varies from 13 percent near the bottom of the pore containing\nregion to 5 percent at the top.\n\n31\n\nFigure 14.

There w a s no alignment of the whiskers with\nthe eutectic lamellae.\n\n33\n\nSample 5: 68 Percent In-Bi, 7 Percent BeCu Fibers, 25 Percent Argon.\nThe objective was to achieve a stable dispersion of metallic fibers and gas\nbubbles in a metal matrix through processing in a weightless environment.\n\nIt w a s determined that the argon gas had leaked from these samples\nduring electron beam welding of the capsules.\nSince the sample occupied only 75 percent of the capsule volume, it\nw a s allowed to move freely within the capsule. Radiographs of the unopened\ncapsules (Fig. 16) show that the control sample, as was to be expected,\nsettled to the bottom. The flight sample w a s free floating upon solidification,\nwith contact only at the walls and slightly at one end. Note the spherical\nshape of the free end of the flight sample. Examination of the surfaces of the\nsamples after opening shows that the flight sample was not in complete contact\nwith the walls of the capsule (Fig. 17)\n\n.\n\nControl\n5c\n\nFlight\n5F\n\nFigure 1 . X-ray radiographs, Samples 5C and 5F.\n6\n\n34\n\nThe fiber dispersion was quite different in the flight sample, as seen\nin the cross section in Figure 18, and the neutron radiograph of an .318 cm\n( 0 . 1 2 5 in.) thick section in Figure 19. Gravity induced segregation was evident\nin the control sample even though the density difference between the fibers and\nmatrix w a s only I\npercent. The bulk of the fibers settled to the bottom with\na small number carried to the top by rising bubbles and surface tension. The\nfibers were dispersed over the entire cross section of the flight sample. The\ndifference in dispersion is seen in the plot of fiber count over the length of the\nspecimen (Fig. 2 0 ) .\nThe surface features of the flight sample were quite different from the\ncontrol sample. There were numerous depressions and pocket formations in\nthe surface of the flight sample, and there w a s a tendency of fiber alignment,\nparticularly on the free end. Within the flight sample there w a s some\ntendency for fibers to coagulate at void interfaces.\nSample 7: 75 Percent In-Bi, 25 Percent Argon. The objective w a s to\nachieve a stable dispersion of gas bubbles in a metal matrix through processing\nin a weightless environment in order to demonstrate to what extent the presence\nof bubble stabilizing dispersion of particles, fibers, whiskers are to be considered for further process development.\nThe radiographs (Fig. 21) show the position of the samples within the\ncapsules. The flight sample w a s touching at isolated points along the capsule\nwalls whereas the control sample had settled to the bottom and w a s in contact\nalong the walls. The supports for the stainless steel mixing screen are also\nseen. The differences are further illustrated in the photographs made after\nremoval from the capsules (Fig. 22).\nThe samples were sectioned longitudinally and prepared for metallo.graphy. Photomacrographs ( Fig. 23) show the differences in solidification\npatterns. Solidification in the control sample progressed from the heat sink\nend, the walls, and the screen. In contrast, solidification in the flight sample\nw a s initiated from the different points at which the melt w a s in contact with\nthe walls. It is believed that this is the cause of the lfrosettell-like structure\nseen in Figure 24.\nThere w a s no observable foam o r gas porosity in the control sample.\nIn contrast, the flight sample retained approximately 3 percent in the bottom\nhalf and 5 percent in the top half. Scanning electron beam photographs of the\nfractured surface of the flight sample adjacent to the mixing screen (Fig. 25)\nrevealed the presence of many pores.\n\n35\n\n+\n0\n\nk\n\n22\nc>\n\nccl\n\n0\n\nr\nn\nQ)\n\n0\n\ncd\n\nccl\n\nk\n\n5\n\nM\n\n36\n\nPLUG END\n(TOP)\n\nHEAT SINK END\n(BOTTOM)\n\nControl\n5c\n\nFlight\n5F\n\nFigure 19.

The objective of this demonstration w a s to achieve a stable dispersion\nof dense spheres and argon gas bubbles in the metal matrix.\nRadiographs of the unopened capsules (Fig. 26) show the differences\nin contact with the container. The flight sample w a s not in good contact with\nthe w a l l s of the container. The convex shape of the top surface of the control\nsample is misleading. This w a s probably due to loose tungsten spheres. The\ntrue solid surface w a s nearly flat.\nIt w a s determined that the argon gas had leaked from these samples\nduring electron beam welding of the capsules.\nUpon opening of the capsules many of the tungsten spheres fell out. The\nsurfaces of both samples were covered with tungsten spheres.\nThe samples were sectioned longitudinally and metallurgically prepared.\nThe macrostructures (Fig. 27) show that there were f e w particles retained\nin the bulk of the control sample and a considerable number retained i n the\nflight sample. Several "rosette" structures are also seen in the flight sample.\nSample 10: 70 Percent In-Bi, 30 Percent Tungsten Particles. The\nobjective of this demonstration w a s to achieve a stable dispersion of the dense\nparticles in the metal matrix.\nWhen the capsules were opened, large quantities of tungsten particles\nfell out of the container. Figure 28 shows the control sample capsule partially\nopened. The holes in the sample contained large quantities of loose particles\nbefore opening. The surfaces of both control and flight samples were covered\nwith particles.\nThe samples were sectioned longitudinally and prepared for metallography. The macrostructures (Fig. 29) show that there were f e w particles\nretained i n the bulk of the control sample and a considerable number retained\nin the flight sample.\nA photomicrograph, (Fig. 30) of the upper section of the flight sample\nshows the number of particles retained within the flight sample.

The objective of this demonstration w a s to obtain a stable dispersion\nof fibers and gas i n the matrix. Paraffin w a s chosen to give a visual display\nof the dispersion.\nThe sectioned flight and control samples are shown in Figure 31.\nThere is practically no difference between the configuration of the flight and\ncontrol sample. It is assumed that there w a s some acceleration applied to\nthe flight sample after mixing which shifted the mass of fibers to one end of the\ncapsule.\nA t the time of sample preparation, only Cerrobend-coated fibers were\navailable. The coating melted during processing causing the fibers to solder\nthemselves together. Consequently the objective of demonstrating fiber dispersion and fiber-bubble interaction w a s not achieved.\n\n47\n\nFlight\nIIF\n\n(Heat Sink End)\n\nControl\nI IC\n\nFigure 3 1. Photomacrographs of longitudinal\nsections, Samples 1I F and I IC.\n\n48\n\nOne significant difference w a s the retention of gas bubbles in the paraffin\nin the flight sample in Figure 32. It w a s determined before opening the samples\nthat most of the argon had leaked from the capsules and there w a s only a limited\namount present. Therefore, only a low bubble density w a s obtained, and the\nproblems of bubble coalescence and surface stabilization were eliminated. The\nstability of bubbles in liquid matrix under low-g solidification was, however,\ndemonstrated.\nSummary of Group B Results. Stable dispersions of particles and fibers\nwere demonstrated in the flight samples even though some had non-wetting\ncharacteristics. A stable dispersion of gas bubbles was maintained in the\nwhisker-reinforced flight Sample 4 and some dispersion of gas w a s maintained\nin flight Samples 7 and 11. The effectiveness of surface tension forces is\nevident in the rounded surface features of the flight samples which did not f i l l\nthe capsules. This tendency to pull away from the container walls and hence to\nchange the heat flow paths produced some unusual metallographic structures\nand suggests that free floating solidification experiments may be important to\nthe understanding of the solidification process under low-g conditions.\n\nImmiscible Materials Dispersions\nThe primary objective of this group of samples w a s to determine the\neffect of a low-g environment on the dispersion of immiscible materials.\nThree samples were prepared: one containing the immiscibles, sodium acetate\ntrihydrate and paraffin only; one containing the irnmiscibles and an inert gas;\nand one containing the immiscibles and dense solid particles.\nProcessing of the samples w a s identical to that used for group B.\nA comprehensive report on the characterization of the samples in this\ngroup and a comparison of the results with calculated data are given in\nReference 5. Only a summary of those studies and results is given here.\n\n*\n\nEach of the samples w a s sectioned longitudinally and polished. The\nentire surface w a s photographed at 1X and IOX and selected areas at 50X.\nThe sample halves were then sectioned, mounted, and polished, and additional\nphotographs were taken of selected areas up to IOOOX. Figure 33 is a schematic\nof the photographic documentation procedure.\nSample 6: 50 Percent Paraf\xe2\x82\xacin, 50 Percent Sodium Acetate.

Longitudinal sections, Samples 6C and 6F.\nExamination of the control sample at higher magnification determined\nthat the paraffin was free of sodium acetate except for the filled shrinkage tube\nand that there was no paraffin dispersed in the sodium acetate. In the flight\nsample there were numerous paraffin inclusions dispersed throughout the sodium\nacetate and vice versa (Fig. 3 5 ) . Photomicrographs at 500X and 100OX show\n\n52\n\nFigure 35a.\n\nFlight Specimen 6F-A-00 (ctr) , sodium acetate\ndispersed in paraffin (50X)\n\n.\n\nFigure 35b.

Duplex dispersions\n(Fig. 38), consisting of a thin shell of paraffin surrounding a sphere of sodium\nacetate, were seen at various locations in the flight sample. Known also as the\n"grapeskin effect" such dispersions have been observed in oil-water mixtures\nand in w e t jet fuel being pumped through pipelines. However, the effect has\nnot been "frozen in" before. More complex dispersions of paraffin which\nsurrounds the sodium acetate; which in turn surrounds paraffin, and the\nreverse, were also seen.\nExamination of the control sample at higher magnifications determined\nthat the sodium acetate and paraffin were completely segregated. In contrast,\neach sample surface of the flight sample showed dispersions of sodium acetate\nin paraffin o r vice versa. The majority of the surfaces contained duplex and\ncomplex dispersions of sodium acetate and paraffin. Photomicrographs show\ndispersions of l p o r less (Fig. 39) .\nSample 12: 40 Percent Paraffin, 40 Percent Sodium Acetate, 20 Percent Tungsten Microspheres. The paraffin, sodium acetate, and tungsten\nmicrospheres were segregated i n the control sample (Fig. 40) with the\nexception of a small cap of sodium acetate with a few tungsten microspheres\nover the top of the shrinkage tube. The cap w a s probably formed in the same\nmanner as in control Sample 6.\nIn the flight samples there were three types of dispersions: a dispersion\nof paraffin (containing 90 percent of the microspheres) into sodium acetate;\nsodium acetate dispersed into paraffin; and a tungsten microsphere blend with\na dispersion of sodium acetate. The tungsten microspheres were preferentially\nwetted by the paraffin; therefore, the continuous phase w a s paraffin with sodium\nacetate dispersed into it.\nExamination of the control sample at higher magnification determined\nthat the paraffin, sodium acetate, and tungsten microspheres were segregated\nexcept for slight dispersion at the interfaces.\n\n54\n\nFlight Specimen 6F-A-05, lp dispersion primarily sodium\nacetate in paraffin (lOO@X).\n\nFlight Specimen 6F-A-02, 1p dispersion of sodium acetate in\nparaffin, surrounded by sodium acetate (IOOOX) .\nFigure 36.

Several areas containing dispersions of 1-p-size particles were found\nalthough not as many as in flight Samples 6 and 9. This may have been due to\nthe influence of the tungsten microspheres.\nComparison of Calculated Data with Demonstration Results. Theoretical\nanalysis w a s performed by TRW to gain insight into the dominating phenomena,\nto predict various aspects of the thermal and mechanical histories of the\nsamples, and to compare these data with the demonstration results. Details\nof their analysis and comparison are given in Reference 5. The general conclusions from these studies were:\na. From the contact angle between the paraffin and the capsule w a l l\non flight Samples 6 and 12, the acceleration level at solidification w a s approximately 10-3g or 0.0098 M/sec2.\ne\nb. Initial mixing w a s insufficient to thoroughly disperse the molten\nsodium acetate and paraffin.\n\nc . The body force exerted on the specimens when they were inserted\non the cooling pin had little or no effect on the distribution of the materials.\n\nd. Since the cooling w a s essentially unidirectional, the surface-tensiondriven convection forces w e r e probably more predominant in causing fluid\nmovement and droplet size and distribution differentiation than the acceleration\nforces present.\ne. There is a possibility that some of the segregation of the materials\nin flight Sample 12 w a s caused by the Reaction Control System firings during\ncapsule cool down.\nFrom the calculated limiting velocity and sedimentation curves, the\ncritical droplet diameter is approximately loop. Droplets less than this size\ntend to be stable in a thermal- o r low-g gradient. This was partially corroborated by the droplet distribution measurements for paraffin.\nf.\n\nSummary of Group C Results. Stable dispersions of immiscible materials processed in a low-g environment were demonstrated. The majority of\nthe dispersions were between 25 pm and I mm in size, although areas containing\ndispersions of I pm or less and droplets up to I c m w e r e observed in three\nflight samples. No droplets were observed in any of the control samples.\nThus droplet formation is associated with mixing and solidification in low g.\n\n60\n\nFour stable types of dispersions were observed in the flight sample:\nsodium acetate in paraffin, paraffin in sodium acetate, a paraffin-tungsten\nmicrosphere blend in sodium acetate, and sodium acetate in a paraffin-tungsten\nmic rosphe re blend.\nStable duplex dispersions and more complex forms of either sodium\n\nacetate in paraffin or vice versa w e r e observed in all flight samples. Since\nthis type of dispersion is unstable on earth, this w a s a direct demonstration\nof the unique potential for processing immiscible materials in a low-g environment.\nNone of the flight samples exhibited a homogeneous density distribution\nwhich would indicate complete dispersion. However, the axial gradation in\ndensity w a s more gradual in the flight samples.and there were areas in each\nof relatively good dispersion. Flight Sample 9 exhibited the best dispersion.\nThe droplet size and distribution did not vary significantly in the radial\ndirection, but droplet size did increase with distance longitudinally from the\nheat sink.\nThe comparison of observed properties with the theoretical analyses\nfurther established the feasibility of processing immiscible materials. These\nresults can be applied to the design of improved experiments for development\nof technology applicable to processing immiscible materials in low g.\n\nConclusions\nDetailed conclusions are given in each of the evaluation reports.\nGenerally, it can be said that the low-g composite casting demonstrations\nserved their purpose in that material structures were produced that cannot\nbe duplicated on earth.\nWhere dispersants, such as fibers, particles, o r gases had been added\nto the matrix, enhanced dispersion and distribution were found in the space\nprocessed samples.\nNormally immiscible mixtures showed stable dispersions unattainable\non earth.\nPremixed samples made from 70 percent metal powders and 30 percent\ndispersed non-melting particles showed no really conclusive differences of\n\n61\n\nparticle distribution between the flight and the control samples. Later investigations showed that the behavior on the ground of such dispersions is not well\nunderstood either.\nThe demonstration showed qualitative results in a very limited range\nof materials and under processing conditions which were not instrumented or\nhighly controlled. Even so, the demonstrations were encouraging in that:\n\na. Unique material structures were produced.\nb. New problems were raised which can be solved by future ground\nand flight experiments.\n\nc. The importance of several factors which must be considered for\nprocess and experiment design were brought to light. These factors included\nthe control of heating and cooling in low g when contact with heaters and heat\nsinks may be intermittent; control of nucleation and of mixing; and control of\ngases for distribution in the melt, o r for removal from the melt and others\nmentioned in the text.\n\n62\n\nAPPENDIX\nINVESTIGATION OF GRAVITY INDUCED SEGREGATION\nEFFECTS IN PARTICLE DISPERSED COMPOSITES\nParticle dispersed composite powder compacts of the type of Specimens\nI\nand 2 were kept in liquid state over long periods of time in order to investigate segregation effects.\n\nDescription of Specimens\nSpecimen V, available from the cancelled Apollo 15 demonstration,\nwas utilized for this investigation. Three identical specimens were available,\ncontrol Specimen V-C, flight Specimen V-F, and Spare V-S. Each specimen\nconsisted of four segments which were separated by copper-coated aluminum\ndiscs. From top to bottom, segment Icontained 20 percent B,C particles in\nn\nIn-Bi powder matrix; segment 2, 10 percent B,C i In-Bi powder matrix; segment 3 , 20 percent W in In-Bi powder matrix; and segment 4, 10 percent W in\nIn-Bi powder matrix.\nAll the powder compacts were prepared similarly to Specimens Iand 2.\n\nTest Procedure\nThe specimens were processed as follows:\nSpecimen V-C was processed in a vertical position in the laboratory\nusing the Apollo 14 heater. The procedure was changed versus the original\nApollo 14 operation insofar that the specimen was not melted in a horizontal\nposition first and then put on the heat sink in a vertical position, but maintained\nin the vertical position in the heater during the cooling phase as well without\nusing the heat sink. This extended the liquid phase of the sample to a total\nof 26 min. A portion of this specimen was reprocessed in the "Blue M" Mechanical Convection Oven through an additional 18-hr liquid phase. In order to\nestablish the original condition a s close as possible, the unused half segments\nwere put back into a specimen container which was refilled with liquid In-Bi.\n\n63\n\nSpecimen V-F was processed in vertical position in the Blue M Oven and\nheld liquid for seven days.\nSpecimen V-S w a s processed as above and held liquid for seven days\nbut in an upside down position.\n\nEva 1 uat ion\nThe Specimens were opened and cut lengthwise similarly to the Apollo\n14 specimens. One half of each segment w a s polished. The extreme difference\nin hardness between particles and matrix required careful selection of silicon\ncarbide grinding papers in order to avoid particle relocation.\nIt is assumed that the visibility of the undisturbed matrix structure\nin (Figs. A-I and A-2) indicates that relocation of particles did not occur\nduring polishing.\n\nThe particle distribution w a s established through visual counting of\nsample areas on photographic enlargements of about 18X of the polished segment cross-sections.\nThe enlarged sample cross section w a s divided by a grid overlay into\n2091 squares. Particle counts w e r e made in 9 sample areas consisting of\n36 squares each. Three areas; each in the top, center, and bottom sections,\nwere counted. Thus an area of 324 grid squares out of a total of 2091 squares,\nor approximately 15.5 percent of the area, w a s evaluated.\nFigure A-3 shows the average distributions of the top, center, and\nbottom areas of each of the four segments after different lengths of liquid\nprocessing time. Assuming that a variation of f 15 percent from the average\ndispersion is typical for the powder compacting processes, it can be stated\nthat no trend of change in distribution because of gravity-induced segregation\ncan be observed.\nThe segments at the top and at the bottom showed the formation of a\nmatrix area free from particles. In order to establish whether this is a gravity\nor a directional cooling effect, Specimen V-S w a s subjected to a seven-day\n\n64\n\n65\n\n3\n\nI\n\nAverage Deviation\nof 3 Top Areas\n\nAverage Deviation\nof 3 Center Areas\n\nAverage Deviation\nof 3 Bottom Areas\n\n30\n\n20\n\n1\n0\n\nI\n\n1\n0\n\n- 100%\n\n20\n\n30\n\n+\n\nDeviation from Average Distribution\n26 min Liquid\n18 h r Liquid\n7 days Liquid\n\n---------\n\n--\n\nSegments I 2, 3 and 4 are shown\n,\nby numbers.\nFigure A-3.\n66\n\nAverage particle distribution.\n\nliquid-phase processing in an upside down position. Figure A-4 shows the\nsamples of segment i processed from left to right for 26 min, and 7 days in\nupright position and 7 days in upside down position. The result is that the\nparticle-free areas appear independent of the duration of the liquid phase and\nalways in the direction toward the top side of the capsule, from which obviously\nthe solidification progresses toward the center of the sample. This rules out\ngravity segregation playing a role in the formation of particle free zones. It\nproves, on the other hand, that the matrix metal is able to move in between\nparticles and that the boundaries of the original matrix powder do not form\noxide barriers to the extent of preventing particle motion. If this would be the\ncase, particles would have to be carried with the metal out-flow o r , vice versa,\ncould not have been carried with the progression of the solidification front. On\nthe other hand, the latter is not verified by a higher particle distribution close\nto the clear metal zone.\nFigure A-4 shows also that the porosity has been carried by the solidification front downward in the left and center sample. This means the gas\ntransport occurred against the direction of gravity segregation. In the right\nsample, which w a s processed in upside down position, the porosity in the upper\nportion is more pronounced, which shows that the gas transport coincides with\nthe direction of gravity segregation. The gas motion does not seem to influence\nthe pafticle distribution, meaning no floatation effect has been observed.\n\nConclusion and Recommendation\nThe tests indicate that only minor gravity induced segregation could\nhave occurred in the particle dispersed composites a s used in Apollo 14 Specimens Iand 2. This contradicts theoretical predictions stating that the tungsten\nparticles, which a r e more than 2 . 5 times heavier than the matrix, should sink,\nand B,C particles, which a r e more than 2 . 5 times lighter than the matrix,\nshould rise. The viscosity of the In-Bi eutectic matrix metal at approx. 20\xc2\xb0\nabove melting temperature was experimentally verified by General Dynamics\nto be comparable to that of water.\nParticles of similar size and shape and comparable density differential\nshow gravity segregation in water under perfect wetting condition. The segregation-preventing mechanism, which must be present in the Specimen type i\nand 2 composites, is presently not known. One factor could be the presence of\nresidual gas at the particle surface which causes the formation of free liquid\nsurfaces which counteract particle motion. In order to investigate this factor,\n\n67\n\n.\n\n-c,\n\n8\n0\nk\na,\n\na\n0\nN\nn\n\nrl\n\n68\n\nsimilar particle dispersions should be produced in a hard vacuum. Additional\ncleaning of the particle surfaces by ion bombardment or R F treatment in order\nto remove residual gas molecules is recommended. Subsequent segregation\ntests over extended liquid-phase processing time would show whether the\nabove situation w a s caused by liquid-solid wetting imperfection because of the\npresence of gas.\n\n69\n\nREFERENCES\n\nSteurer, W.
