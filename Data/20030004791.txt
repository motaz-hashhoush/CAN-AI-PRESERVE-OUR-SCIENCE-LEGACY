b'Noise Protection\nThere is increasing effort in the U.S. todevelop\nways\nof controlling noise, particularly\nin industrial\nenvironments,\ndue to federal and state laws, labor\nunion insistence and new findings relative to noise\npollution impact on human health. Among various\nnoise protection\ntechniques and systems being\nemployed is a line of highly effective acoustic\nmaterials known as SMART Products, whose\ndevelopment\nstemmed from space research. SMART\nis an acronym for Sound Modification\nand Regulated\nTemperature;\nthe products are manufactured\nby\nEnvironmental\nHealth Systems, Framingham,\nMassachusetts.\n\n88\n\nThe basis of all SMART products is SMART\ncompound,\na liquid plastic mixture with exceptional\nenergy/sound\nabsorbing qualities. The basic compound-later\nrefined for noise protection\nuse--was\ndiscovered by Arthur Metzger, a former NASA\nemployee once engaged in work on the guidance\nsystem for the Apollo spacecraft.\nAn early version of\nthe guidance system developed severe vibration\nproblems which were traced to the plastic compound\nencapsulating\nthe system\'s electronics;\nthe compound\ndid not absorb sufficient energy to dampen vibrations.\nIn a search for a better compound,\nMetzger found a\nvery elastic type of plastic which literally soaked up\nenergy. Metzger recognized its potential for noise\nprotection\nand, after he retired from NASA, he\nfounded Environmental\nHealth Systems, of which he\nis president, to develop and market the compound\nand\nassociated\nproducts--noise-deadening\nadhesives,\nsheets and enclosures.\nThe photos illustrate two examples of SMART\napplications.\nAbove, the noise-blocking\ngreen\nwall encloses a manufacturing\noperation at General\nElectric Company\'s Providence,\nRhode Island plant\nwhere 60-ton automatic presses stamp out light\nsockets at extremely high noise levels. Testimony to\nthe noise-reducing\neffectiveness\nof the SMART\nenclosure is the fact that GE had to install a warning\nlight to indicate that a press has malfunctioned\nand\nstopped operating; it is uniformly quiet outside the\nenclosure, so plant workers could not tell that a press\nwas not operating without the light signal. At left,\nSMART screens atop a Polaroid Company building\nin Waltham, Massachusetts\nblock noise from rooftop\nmachinery so that it does not carry to a nearby\nresidential area. In addition to industrial use,\nexamples of SMART applications\ninclude soundproofing for discotheques\nin Hilton hotels and a\nhospital "quiet room" for audiological\ntests.\nEnvironmental\nHealth Systems is working on\nformulations\nfor aircraft cabins, subways, tunnels,\nfarm machinery and a variety of other applications.\n\n'
