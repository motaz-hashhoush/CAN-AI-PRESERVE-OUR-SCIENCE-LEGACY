b'1. HELICOPTER SIMULATOR STANDARDS\nEDWARD M. BOOTHE\n\nI will reiterate some of the things that Jim Erickson\nsaid, but my main purpose is to discuss the work that has\nbeen done on the Helicopter Simulator Advisory Circular,\n120-XX.\nFirst I would like to thank all of you for being here\nand for supporting this activity. I know it is quite an effort\nfor you, and not without expense. But, as Jim said, we in\nthe regulatory business certainly need your support and\ninput; in fact, we can\'t do our job without it.\nI would also like to recognize that we have a good\ndeal of international support. We have friends and representatives here today from New Zealand, the United\nKingdom, Canada, and France. That is a fine representation, and it is appreciated. If I failed to mention a country\nthat is represented it is only because I didn\'t meet that\nrepresentative this morning.\nI want to briefly describe where we are on helicopter\nsimulator standards. As Jim said, the advantages of simulation have long been enjoyed by the airplane community,\nand the use of simulators has expanded steadily. Since\n1980 there has been an average annual increase of 14% in\nthe inventory of airplane simulators used by the entire\nU.S. Air carrier and corporate aviation industry. I think\nthat is pretty remarkable: there were about 88 simulators\nin 1980, which were, by today\'s standards, not very\nsophisticated, and just a month or so ago we exceeded\n300 simulators that are in service to U.S. industry. But\nthat capability has not been available to the civil helicopter community. I know a good deal of simulation\ncapability has been available to the military services but\nnot to the civilian community.\nThe need has been pointed out in previous meetings\nand workshops, and I think it is becoming obvious. In fact\nI just read on the way out here that some people are referring to aircraft as part-task trainers. And I think that is\ntrue. As Jim mentioned, there are so many things that one\ncan do in simulator training and checking that simply\ncannot be done in aircraft. At a recent meeting, a paper\nfrom Norway described an incident in a Super Puma.\n\nThere was a tail-rotor failure at hover, but the crew recognized the failure immediately, recovered with no damage\nto the aircraft and no injuries to the crew. Complete credit\nfor that quick failure recognition and quick recovery was\ngiven to the crew\'s practice of that precise failure in the\nsimulator. It is this kind of event that causes the aircraft to\nbe called a part-task trainer. You cannot do the whole job\nof training in the aircraft. Moreover, there is a big and\nfavorable cost factor involvei ; , I simulator training.\nBut getting on with this, the history of trying to establish some civil standards for helicopter simulators goes\nback at least to the meeting we had in Atlanta in 1984, at\nwhich time we had a fairly general review of the state of\nthe technology. The following year we had a working\ngroup that did produce a draft advisory circular for helicopter simulator standards, but it never progressed. One of\nthe reasons, I think, was because the federal regulations\nthat control training and checking for airmen do not recognize any credits for helicopter simulators.\nThen just last year the Royal Aeronautical Society\nhad a seminar on helicopter simulation and again the\ninterest and the need were indicated and the use of simulation at that time in North Sea oil operations was pointed\nout. Of course that is more of interest, you might say, to\nthe United Kingdom and, in this case, Norway, where a\nnumber of simulators are in use. But there are only two\ncivilian helicopter simulators in use in the United States,\nand I think that is because the FAA permitted use of helicopter simulators for pilot certification only by exemption. So there is no general credit. Consequently there are\nno current standards, which is why we are here.\nThose two simulators, although being limited in their\napplications, still are quite valuable in their use. The\nBell 222 has no hover credits, and it was qualified by\nusing an old interim standard that we were working on.\nWhat we really did was have four expert pilots (I think\nJim Erickson might have been one of them) who flew the\naircraft for a few minutes and then performed the same\n\ntask in the simulator. They then went back to the aircraft\nand then back to the simulator.\nThose of you who have in the past been involved in\nhandling-qualities work understand, I am sure, that after\n20 minutes you might as well get out of that device and\ninto the next one since pilot adaptation time is usually\nquite short.\nThe next one was the S-76. At that time we did have\nthe interim draft standard that was produced in 1985. But\nbecause nobody expected that, there really were no data\nfor the aircraft, at least not to the extent that we needed\nthem, so we used what data were available. We did the\nsame routine that I just mentioned with some expert\npilots, and we qualified the simulator and developed an\nexemption through a petition from Flightsafety for credits\nfor that simulator. And in fact, you can do most of an ATP\ncertification check in that helicopter simulator with only\nabout three or four follow-up maneuvers for validation in\nthe aircraft. So we know it can be done.\nSo why try again now? We still only have two simulators. I think in the last five years we have certainly\nincreased our knowledge and our experience. Some of the\nquestions we had about standards five or six years ago, we\nnow have answers to. One small example is control loading. Six years ago when we said you have to simulate the\nbreak-out forces in a helicopter control system, most people in the business said we couldn\'t do that. But I know\nfor a fact that today we can do that and that we can do it\nquite well. And it will stay constant, not changing as each\nperson uses the machine.\nI think here today we are going to follow up on these\npast issues. But another very important thing is happening: the FARs are being revised. There is a new draft\nPart 142 that primarily addresses training centers. The\nnotice of proposed rule-making for that effort will be\navailable this summer with, we hope, a rule by some time\nin late 1992. It will permit training and checking credits\nfor helicopter simulators. I think that is primarily going to\nbe started at the higher levels of pilot certification. But at\nleast that is really where we are in airplane simulation.\nThere are not many simulator credits for the lower levels\nof pilot certification; they are all pretty much at the upper\nlevels.\nOne objective of our efforts this week is to form a\nworking group of experts who will meet as necessary to\naddress these issues and to establish standards and guidance. This process has worked exceptionally well,\nalthough slowly, with airplane simulators. And the development process for airplane simulator standards is cer-\n\ntainly applicable to helicopter simulators. Over the past\n15 years the standards for helicopter simulators have progressed such that they are almost as remarkable as the\ntechnology, but the idea has been to keep them in step\nwith the technology.\nIn 1978 we did the first crude landing approval in a\nsimulator. And now we are doing total pilot training and\nchecking in simulators, and the standards have been\nrevised to reflect that. The working group process has\nworked; in fact it worked to the extent on the lastest airplane standard that that standard has been accepted as the\ncore of international standards for airplane simulators. We\nhope that will become an International Civil Aviation\nOrganization (ICAO) policy or handbook for international\nuse for commonality and qualification of airplane simulators. The point is the process should be equally applied to\nhelicopter simulators.\nIt is hoped that the working group membership we\nseek will represent a broad range of the community of aircraft and simulator manufacturers, users, and operators.\nAnd, of course, the final customers, the training experts,\nthe technical societies, and the regulatory authorities must\nbe represented. We would like the group to be limited to\nabout 30 members; our experience shows that with more\nthan that, it is very difficult to make progress. In fact, on\nthe international working group, Brian Hampson, who is\nthe chairman for the Royal Aeronautical Society, has\nmade a special effort to limit the size of the group. I thank\nhim for that, and I think a great deal of the progress that\nhas been made is a result of keeping the same members\nmeeting after meeting and because we have limited the\ngroup to those same members. Even so, we still rehashed\na lot of stuff.\nAs Harry Reasoner once put it, helicopters are different. Some pilot tasks are more demanding in the helicopter simulator than they are in helicopters. We have\nnoticed that the hover and low-speed tasks have been the\nmost challenging to simulate. That is one reason the\nBell 222 is not qualified for that, although it probably\ncould be with some updates. Progress was made in that\narea, however, so that the S-76 is so qualified. Not all\npilots agree that that should be true, by the way, but that is\nthe nature of these kinds of activities, I think.\nNot all simulators need to be qualified for all tasks, so\nwe will be looking at a number of levels of simulators.\nWe have tried to keep those levels aligned with what has\nbeen successful for airplanes, mainly so we can keep the\nrecord straight. And v oe working later in this\n"\n\nWorkshop to form the group that will follow through with\nthis effort.\nSo, if you would be kind enough, then, please review\nthe draft document. It is modeled, in terms of general\npolicy and structure, on the airplane document. But that is\na matter of style, not content. And we would like to\n\npursue that approach because we have spent years actually\nfinalizing that format and structure. Nevertheless, the\ntechnical content is certainly something that needs to be\naddressed, and addressed in fine detail. I will look forward to hearing from you on Thursday when we form the\nstandards working group. Thank you.\n\nEdward M.
