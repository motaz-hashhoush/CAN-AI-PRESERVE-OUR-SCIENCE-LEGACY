The basic scientific goals of NASA's Planetary Program are to increase  man's understanding of the origin and evolution of the solar system,  the origin and evolution of life, and the earth, through a comparative study of the other planets. Studies of the planets will be continued during the second decade. Aspects of manned space flights are discussed, giving attention to the Skylab workshop, and the Space Shuttle. The applications program is divided into four major areas including  meteorology, communications and navigation, geodesy, and earth resources. Areas of aeronautical research are also examined.", "title": "NASA'S second decade in space.", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-06T17:36:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19720053608, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Manganiello, E.
