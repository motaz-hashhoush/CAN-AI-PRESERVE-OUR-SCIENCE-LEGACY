In one embodiment, where the input impedance is reduced in essence, to solely a capacitive reactance, an operational amplifier in a follower configuration is driven at its non-inverting input and a resistor with a predetermined magnitude is connected between the inverting and non-inverting inputs. A second embodiment eliminates the capacitance from the input by adding a second stage to the first embodiment. The second stage is a second operational amplifier in a non-inverting gain-stage configuration where the output of the first follower stage drives the non-inverting input of the second stage and the output of the second stage is fed back to the non-inverting input of the first stage through a capacitor of a predetermined magnitude. These amplifiers, while generally useful, are very useful as sensor buffer amplifiers that may eliminate significant sources of error.", "title": "High input impedance amplifier", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T20:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950019618, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kleinberg, Leonard L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "898a9ea693d74c02aa9d2b9296eed88f"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950019618, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950019618, "id": "7806119aca80442e9702a1a00cbb4697", "publicationDate": "1995-03-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19950019618.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19950019618/downloads/19950019618.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19950019618/downloads/19950019618.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19950019618/downloads/19950019618.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
