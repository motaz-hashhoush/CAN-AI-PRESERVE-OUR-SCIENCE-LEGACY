An artery configuration which is self-priming in one-g was emphasized. Two artery modifications were evolved as candidates to achieve one-g priming and will provide the very high performance: the four artery and the eight artery configurations. These were each evaluated analytically for performance and priming capability. The eight artery configuration was found to be inadequate from a performance standpoint. The four artery showed promise of working. A five-inch long priming element test article was fabricated using the four artery design. Plexiglas viewing windows were made on each end of the heat pipe to permit viewing of the priming activity. The five-inch primary element would not successfully prime in one-g. Difficulties on priming in one-g raised questions about zero-g priming. Therefore a small test element heat pipe for verifying that the proposed configuration will self-prime in zero-g was fabricated and delivered.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840009463, "id": "9f479c1caef7496fa8cb549f9c62006a", "publicationDate": "1983-12-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840009463.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840009463/downloads/19840009463.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840009463/downloads/19840009463.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840009463/downloads/19840009463.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
