b'Aviation Weather Services\nCharles H. Sprinkle\nNational Weather Service\nWashington, D. C ,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has a vast\nW\noperating program. N S personnel are found a t\nover 400 f a c i l i t i e s i n the 50 s t a t e s and elseW\nwhere. Altogether, N S has about 5,000 people\nworking in meteorological, hydrological and\noceanographic operations. In one year, about\n3.5 million forecasts and warnings are issued,\nIn addition, countless individual briefings and\nservices are provided on a routine b u t unscheduled basis.\n\nProvide weather support for:\na.\n\nProduction of food and f i b e r ;\n\nb.\n\nManagement of water resources;\n\nc.\n\nProduction, distribution and use\nof energy; and\n\nd.\n\nThe provision of forecasts and weather warnings\nt o the general public and to specialized users\nW\ni s the heart of the N S operations. The offices\nmost involved in the production of forecasts are\nthe Weather Service Forecast Offices (WSFOs) ,\nwhile warnings are issued by both WSFOs and the\nmore localized Weather Service Offices (WSOs).\nIn general, WSFOs \' areas o f responsi b i 1 i ty conform t o s t a t e boundaries. However, larger and\nmore populous s t a t e s (Texas, California, Nw York,\ne\netc.) contain more than one WSFO, while some\nsmaller s t a t e s are within the area of responsib i l i t y of WSFOs of neighboring s t a t e s (Connecticut and Rhode Island a r e within WSFO Boston\'s\nSs\narea of responsi bl i t y ) W O general l y serve\nthe urban areas of the nation by providing a more\nlocalized and tailored service. Usually, several\nW O l i e within the area of responsibility of a\nSs\nWSFO. Forecasts issued by the WSFOs go t o the\ngeneral public as well as t o specialized users.\nA sizable e f f o r t of a WSFO i s concerned w i t h\nmeteorological support t o the aviation industry.\nThe National Meteorological Center (NMC) , located\nnear Washington, DC, provides the WSFOs with guidance material used in developing forecasts.\n\nEfficient and safe a i r operations.\n\nThe principle r o l e of the NblS i s to issue severe\nweather warnings t o save lives and t o minimize\nproperty loss. The United States has a greater\nvariety of severe weather than any other nation\ni n the world. Hurri canes , tornadoes , f 1oods ,\nflash floods, thunderstorms and severe weather\ntake an inordinate number of lives and cause\nthousands of injuries each year, despite advances\nin technology and s k i l l s i n forecastinq and\nwarnings. I t i s estimated t h a t the cost t o the\nnation i s well over $2 billion per year from\nthese extreme weather events,\n\n.\n\nN other industry i s more sensitive t o weather\no\nthan aviation, There are more than 825,000 cert i f i e d pilots operating over 230,000 a i r c r a f t\nfrom an excess of 15,000 landing places in the\nUnited States, The l a s t decade has been a period\nof rapid change. The aviation community expanded\na t a rate unprecedented in our Nation\'s history,\nA more mobile, safety conscious, and energy conscious society has become more demanding of\nsophisticated weather information. The N S has\nW\nbeen working t o meet the challenge of getting\ntimely and accurate weather information to the\nend user --- the p i l o t ,\n\nhrarnings from both WSFOs and WSOs are issued f o r\nsevere weather such as hurricanes, tornadoes ,\nsevere thunderstorms, flash floods and extreme\nwinter weather. The National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) i n Kansas City, and the\nNational Hurricane Center ( N H C ) i n Miami, provide\nthe main s u p p o r t f o r the warnings program.\n\nProviding weather service t o aviation i s a j o i n t\ne f f o r t of the NWS, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) , the mi 7 i tary weather services and\nother aviation oriented groups and individuals,\nBecause of international f l i g h t s and a need f o r\nworldwide weather, foreign weather services also\nhave a v i t a l input into our service.\n\nAnother important aspect of N S operations i s the\nW\nacquisition of meteorological data. Such data\nare collected from the land, the sea and the\nupper atmosphere by peoDle from many countries.\nAdditionally, s a t e l l i t e information i s sent to\nmany receiving stations on the ground.\n\nThe cooperation between the FAA and NWS for the\nprovision of aviation weather services and communications i s described i n a 1977 Memorandum\nof Agreement between the two agencies. One of\nthe major responsibilities of the N S i s t o proW\nduce the forecasts and warnings i n support of the\naviation community. The dissemination of this\nweather information t o p i l o t s i s the responsibZlity of the FAA and of the a i r c a r r i e r s ,\nthemselves. The NWS\'s responsibility i n t h i s\narea stems from the Federal Aviation Act of\n1958 (Section 101: T i t l e 49, Section 1301,\nUnited States Code) as amended, and the NWS\'s\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe primary responsibilities of the N S are to:\nW\n1.\n\nProvide public forecasts f o r land and\nadjacent ocean areas f o r planning and\noperati on;\n\nProvide warnings of severe weather and\nflooding for the protection of l i f e and\nproperty;\n\n14\n\norganic authority contained i n T i t l e 15 of the\nUnited States Code.\n\n(CFCF) i n Washington of any weather changes\nt h a t may affect the safe and e f f i c i e n t flow of\na i r t r a f f i c . They also coordinate w i t h the\nN S O t o ensure the most accurate terminal\nWF s\nand area forecasts and in-flight advisories\npossible with the existing s t a t e of the science.\nWhen such coordination i s n o t possible, they\nmodify and update those forecasts f o r the i n ternal guidance of the ARTCC\'s control1 ers.\n\nNATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE BASIC SERVICES\nToday, the N S provides a broad range of proW\nducts to the aviation community. Fifty-two\nWSFOs prepare airport terminal forecasts three\ntimes per day with amendments as needed f o r\nnearly 500 airports in the 50 s t a t e s and in the\nCaribbean., Our offices also produce about 300\nindividual route-oriented forecasts three times\nper day f o r the 48 contigious s t a t e s . Thirteen\nof these offices prepare area forecasts twice a\nday of general weather conditions over the\ne n t i r e country. These same offices issue inf l i g h t advisories of hazardous weather conditions due t o turbulence, icing, strong low-level\nwinds and/or broad areas of low clouds o r res t r i c t e d v i s i b i l i t i e s . In-flight advisories\nof dangerous conditions associated with thunderstorms are issued each hour by a dedicated aviation unit a t the NSSFC i n Kansas City.\n\nThe CWSU meteorologists have the following\nspecific responsibilities:\n1.\n\n2.\n\nThey work closely with the FAA o f f i c i a l s\nhaving responsibilities and/or interests\ni n aviation safety f o r t h e i r Center area.\n\n3.\n\nThey provide detailed briefings of current\nand forecast weather several times per day\nf o r the ARTCC\'s area,\n\n4,\n\nThey serve as consultants t o the ARTCC\ncontrollers, t o en route f l i g h t advisory\nservice s p e c i a l i s t s and t o central flow\nmeteorologists in situations where hazardous weather impedes the normal flow of\na i r t r a f f i c requiring an alternate t r a f f i c\nrouting t o be determined.\n\n5,\n\nThey use weather radar and s a t e l l i t e receiving equipment, along with other available data sources, t o forecast and a l e r t\nARTCC controllers to weather conditions\naffecting o r expected t o affect a i r routes\nwithin t h e i r area of responsibility.\n\n6,\n\nThey concern themselves w i t h the e f f i c i e n t\ncollection of Pilot Reports (PIREPS)\nreceived a t the ARTCC and t h e i r distribution to the weather communications network.\nWorking with the weather coordinator, they\nobtain specific PIREPS from t h e i r areas of\nconcern\n\n7.\n\nThey participate in special programs involving localized meteorological phenomena\nwhich could a f f e c t a i r c r a f t operations a t\nspecific airports,\n\n8.\n\nThe question of how t h i s information can best\nbe conveyed t o those w i t h "a need t o know",\nincluding FAA specialists and controllers and\nusers of the National Airspace System, in the\nmost timely and e f f i c i e n t manner possible has\nbeen of concern for some time. W have been\ne\nworking with the FAA to a l l e v i a t e this problem.\nThe problem i s especially c r i t i c a l when hazardous\nweather i s involved. To i l l u s t r a t e t h i s point,\none merely has t o look a t the s t a t i s t i c s on\na i r c r a f t accidents; they don\'t change much from\nf\nyear t o year. O the 4,000 to 5,000 general\naviation accidents occurring annually, 20 t o 25\npercent of a l l f a t a l accidents are weatherrelated, In many cases, these weather-related\naccidents involve the loss of a large number of\nlives. The most recent examples are the accie\ndents t h a t occurred a t Nw Orleans and in\nWashington e a r l i e r t h i s year.\n\nThey monitor a l l weather reports, forecasts\nand warnings issued by responsible WSOs in\nand near the Center\'s area of responsibility\nand remain aware of any weather conditions\nwhich m i g h t adversely a f f e c t a i r t r a f f i c\noperations.\n\nThey conduct weather training sessions f o r\na i r t r a f f i c controllers and specialists\nand are, themselves, involved in various\nN S training programs aimed a t up-grading\nW\nt h e i r use of s a t e l l i t e and radar information as i t affects a i r c r a f t operations.\n\nMany things have been done and a r e being done\nto improve the flow of the most v i t a l real -time\nweather information t o the users of the National\nAirspace System.\n\nThe Center Weather Service Unit (CWSU) program\nbegan i n 1978, This cooperative e f f o r t with\nthe FAA represents a major e f f o r t t o improve\nthe dissemination of real-time weather information by controllers t o the p i l o t i n f l i g h t . The\nprogram expanded from 13 t o 21 Air Route Traffic\nControl Centers ( ARTCCs) and was completed early\nt h i s year w i t h the addition of a fourth meteorologist position in each center. The program\nuses N S meteorologists located i n ARTCCs t o\nW\nprovide meteorological consul tation and advisories t o a i r t r a f f i c personnel\nThe CIJSU meteorologists\nterminals and routes of\narea of responsibility.\ncontroller, the weather\nologists a t the Central\n\nSeveral improvements are currently being implemented i n ARTCCs t o improve the flow of v i t a l\nweather information. Namely, the FAA\'s new\nhigh-speed communications system, the Leased\nService A System, i s being installed t o aid in\nmore rapid accumulation of weather intelligence\nfrom places outside the Center. Also, color\n\nmonitor major a i r t r a f f i c\nf l i g h t in the ARTCC\'s\nThey inform the flow\ncoordinator and meteorFlow Control Facility\n1\n\n15\n\nradar monitors to aid i n the identification of\nhazardous weather phenomena, especially thunderstorms, are being installed f o r the use of CWSU\nmeteorologists. The program i s expected to be\ncompleted in the Spring of 1983.\n\narea-type aviation weather forecasts, however,\na r e currently not i n a format readily adaptable\nt o t h i s new technology, This indicates a need\nfor new methods of describing area-type aviation\nW\nweather phenomena. N S proposed a new grid data\nbase concept, the Aviation Route Forecast (ARF).\nDevelopment of a working ARF prototype has been\nundertaken by the MITRE Corporation in McLean,\nVirginia, f o r the FAA and NWS. A graphical\nforecasting system has been developed in which\nW\nthe N S forecaster inputs geographic contours\nt o a computer t o describe the effective areas\nof meteorological parameters. Overlayed on the\nforecaster\'s multi-state forecast area i s a\n22 x 22 mm grid. As each weather contour i s\ncompleted, the computer determines the affected\ng r i d squares and s e t s them accordingly i n the\ndata base, Subsequently, the g r i d s surrounding\na p i l o t \' s requested route are retrieved and a\nbriefing i s assembled.\n\nThe main area of concern i s the communications\ncapabilities from the CWSU meteorologists w i t h i n\nthe Center and t o appropriate control faci 1i t i e s\nwithin the Center\'s area of responsibility\nincluding, b u t not limited to, Terminal Radar\nApproach Control (TRAC) faci 1i t i e s , towers ,\nEn route Flight Advisory Service (EFAS) and\nFlight Service Station (FSS) f a c i l i t i e s . A t\nthe present time, in most centers, t h i s i s done\nmanually, by telephone. I t is hoped t h a t a t\nWU\nsome time in the future, the C S meteorologists\nwill be able t o automatically communicate\nweather intelligence (by u t i l i z i n g the LeasedService A System, t o appropriate locations both\ninside and outside the ARTCC.\n\nThe ARF input workstation and o u t p u t briefing\ninformation package underwent an operational\nevaluation t h i s summer, Recommended software\nand/or hardware changes from t h i s operational\nt e s t will be considered t h i s f a l l , and refinements to the equipment and procedures made.\n\nNEXT GENERATION WEATHER RADAR PRQGRAM\nThe Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) i s\nthe new weather radar system being developed\nby the Department of Defense, the FAA and the\nN S to replace the current aging weather radars;\nW\nand a t the same time, improve the detection of\nhazardous weather. NEXRAD w i 11 have Doppler\ncapability, The Joint Doppler Operational\nProject (JDOP) demonstrated the feasi bi 1i t y of\nDoppler technology in f i e l d t e s t s a t NOAA\'s\nNational Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) in\nNorman, Oklahoma, d u r i n g the period 1976-1979.\n\nWHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?\nA number of technological p o s s i b i l i t i e s for\ndetecting severe weather, f o r communicating,\nintegrating and displaying the data, and f o r\ndisseminating weather forecasts and warnings\ncan be foreseen, The geostationary s a t e l l i t e ,\nthe Doppler radar, automated weather observing\nsystems and a whole range of ground-based remote\nsensing systems will permit far better detection\nof severe weather than currently possible, This\nnew capacity t o observe the small-scale atmospheric circulation will improve severe weather\ndetection and subsequent warnings, Low-cost\nmini- and micro-computers now make i t possible\nfor our forecasters to assimilate the information and make decisions quickly.\n\nSince radial velocities of raindrops in a storm\ncan be measured, Doppler radar offers marked\nimprovements over conventional radar f o r early\nand accurate identification of thunderstorm\nhazards , especially tornadoes and squall 1 ines,\nThe NEXRAD System will also allow f o r a more\ncomplete geographical coverage than the present\nradar network. I n i t i a l f i e l d i n s t a l l a t i o n i s\nexpected t o begin i n 1987 and be completed by\n1990.\n\nThe automation of surface observations and of\narea, route and terminal forecasts will play an\nimportant role in the NWS\'s aviation weather\nservices program in the eighties. The primary\nemphasis of the aviation program will s h i f t\ntowards preparing detailed terminal forecasts\nf o r a s i x or eight-hour period and f o r providing\nsevere weather information i n a timely way to the\na i r t r a f f i c control system.\n\nJOINT AIRPOR~WEATHER STUDIES\nThe Joint Airport Weather Studies (JAWS) Project\nf i e l d experiment was conducted from My 15 t h i s\na\nyear in and near Denver, Colorado. T h i s proj e c t , under the auspices of the National Center\nf o r Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder,\nColorado, and the University of Chicago, i s\nsponsored by the National Science Foundation\n(NSF), the FAA, NOAA and NASA. Three groundbased Doppler radars and several research a i r A S\nc r a f t participated i n the J W program. An\nexamination of the data collected i s currently\n/ongoing and i s expected t o g i v e new i n s i g h t\ninto the nature and behavior of thunderstorms\nand t h e i r inherent threat to aviation,\n\nCONCLUSION\nI t i s recognized t h a t more than any other transportation system, aviation i s affected by weather.\nThe transitory and often short-lived nature of\nhazardous weather phenomena mandates the need for\nthe l a t e s t weather information t o be i n the hands\nof aircrews, a i r t r a f f i c controllers, dispatchQrs\nand others concerned w i t h the safe and e f f i c i e n t\nuse of the NAS. Achieving a firm and comprehensive physical understanding of the processes t h a t\ndetermine the character of thunderstorms i s w i t h out question one of the most important challenges\nfacing the atmospheric sciences community today,\n\nAUTOMATED AVIATION ROUTE FORECAST\nAn objective of the FAA\'s Flight Service Automation Program (FSA) i s the capability f o r a\np i l o t to obtain a self-briefing through d i r e c t\naccess terminals or voice-response systems. The\nI\n\n16\n\nThere will be s c i e n t i f i c and technological opportunities that will enable us to make significant\nimprovements to the services w provide the avie\nation community. The NWS, the FAA and other\n\nNASA\'s Aviation Safety\n\nFederal agencies a s well as the academic community have j o i n e d i n a comprehensive, cooperative\ne f f o r t to meet the challenge before us today.\n\n- Meteorology Research Programs\n\nRoger L. Winblade\nNASA Headquarters\nWashington, DC\ne\nby experiencing the event. That i s , w are\nattempting t o find the microstructure of the\ng u s t environment.\n\nOne of the research areas included i n NASA\'s\nsubsonic a i r c r a f t programs i s t h a t o f aviation\nsafety. A major element i n that aviation safety\nresearch program addresses meteorological\nhazards to flight. The various research programs in meteorological hazards have been underway for a number of years; some are phasing out;\nsome are j u s t starting. I\'d l i k e t o go through\nw h a t w now have currently underway, what we\'ve\ne\ndone recently, and some of the ideas on where\nw think we\'re going.\ne\n\nThrough the use of a specially instrumented B-57\na i r c r a f t , w are flying into turbulence and\ne\nmeasuring the l a t e r a l g u s t gradients over the\nspan\nthe airplane.\nThis program i s thus a t\ntempting to identify the e f f e c t on the airplane\nof gust gradients of the s i z e of the a i r c r a f t .\nThis program will be discussed l a t e r i n detail\nby Warren Campbell of NASA/Marshall Space F1 i g h t\nCenter.\n~f\n\nIn general, the areas that w have in the\ne\nmeteorological hazards program are: severe\nstorms and the hazards t o f l i g h t generated by\nsevere storms; clear a i r turbulence, an area\nt h a t \' s been w i t h us a long time; icing; warm fog\ndissipation; and landing systems. Landing systems are included since once you make your way\nthrough what may be a hazardous atmosphere and\nend u p on the ground, you are landing in what\ni s a very large, heavy, f a s t tricycle; and the\ninterface a t that point becomes a rather c r i t i c a l\narea. W have also recently completed some\ne\nexperiments (one of the few areas in which\ns a t e l l i t e s have been used as a source of d a t a\nfor us) relative t o remote sensing of ozone.\nA l s o using s a t e l l i t e s i n a s l i g h t l y different\ne\nmode, as a d a t a relay system, w have looked\na t the possible benefits to be derived from\nusing essentially real-time wind data f o r f l i g h t\nplanning\n\nNASA i s also a participant i n the Joint Airport\nWeather Studies (JAWS) program which i s delving\ninto the physical properties and generation of\nlow-level wind shears. In addition t o providing\ne\nf l i g h t support via our 8-57 a i r c r a f t , w a r e\nalso involved i n certain areas of data analysis.\nDr, John McCarthy of NCAR will speak on t h i s\nprogram in detail l a t e r in the Workshop.\n\nClear a i r turbulence (CAT) has been a hazard and\nan annoyance throughout the years as airplanes\nhave changed in character from propellers to j e t s .\nThe drag to mass r a t i o has changed. The upsets\nexperienced by the large transports represent a\nsevere hazard in a i r travel, I n i t i a l l y , as w\ne\nlearned t o cope with the upsets, flying procedures\nwere implemented t o a l l e v i a t e the e f f e c t s d u r i n g\nthe turbulence encounters ; the hazard was 1essened significantly. Yet, w are continually\ne\nreminded t h a t the problem has n o t been solved.\nThe l a s t encounter I can recall d i r e c t l y was a\nDC-10 encountering severe CAT over Denver, and\nthere were a number of people h u r t in the\nairplane. N severe damage was sustained by the\no\na i r c r a f t ; b u t i t was an unanticipated encounter\nwith turbulence. NASA has undertaken a long-term\nstudy of devices t h a t may have potential for remote detection and early warning of CAT. The\nLaser-Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) , the infra-red\nradiometer and the microwave radiometer a1 1\nhave potential , b u t they a l l have shortcomings,\nW are, however, continuing t o explore methods\ne\nof overcoming these shortcomings.\n\n.\n\nIn the severe storms research, started in 1977,\nw are attempting t o identify what, i n f a c t , i s\ne\nthe makeup and the structure of severe storms,\nprincipally thunderstorms. Ideally, one would\nlike t o do t h i s kind of work with remote\nsensing; b u t in many areas, i t i s impossible t o\nremotely sense the kind of information t h a t i s\nneeded. One such program that has become very\nsuccessful, and i s hardly a remote sensing program, i s the F-106 that i s used t o f l y into\nthunderstorms i n an attempt t o obtain d i r e c t\nlightning strikes. One hundred seventy-six (176)\ns t r i k e s have been obtained i n three ( 3 ) years.\nI t i s a highly instrumented airplane, T h i s instrumentation i s now allowing us t o identify or\ncharacterize lightning s t r i k e s in f l i g h t and\nidentify and hopefully predict the effects of\nlightning on a i r c r a f t systems and structures.\n\nDr. Joe Shaw of Lewis Research Center will be\ngiving a detailed discussion on our a i r c r a f t\nicing research program. T h i s area has re-emerged\nas an area of concentration f o r NASA, centered\ndirectly about the icing research tunnel f a c i l i t i e s a t the Lewis Research Center. In addition,\nw have found that w need data on atmospheric\ne\ne\n\nA second area where remote sensing may be used\ni n the future will be t o sense g u s t environments.\nCurrently, i t i s a matter of obtaining the data\n17\n\n'
