Marshall Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, Huntsville, Alabama.\nThe report presents a brief synopsis of the early parts of the program\nwhich were reported to NASA/MSFC \'in previously issued MTI technical reports:\n1.\n\nMTI\n\n71TR1 - "Design and Fabrication of Prototype System for Early\n\xe2\x80\xa2Warning and Impending Bearing Failure", January, 1972\n\n2.\n\nMTI 73TR33 - "Review of Mechanical Vibration Tests Conducted on\n^Control Moment Gyros and Life Test Fixture", August, 1973\n\nIt also presents in detail the results of additional experimental work which\nwas specified in contract modification No. 12, and which have not been previously reported to NASA/MSFC.\n\nV\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nA test program was conducted with the objective of developing a method and\nequipment for on-line monitoring of installed ball-bearings to detect deterioration or impending failure of these bearings.\n\nThe program was aimed specifi-\n\ncally at the spin-axis bearings of the Bendix ATM Control Moment Gyro (CMC).\nThese were similar in internal geometry to Barden 107H angular contact ball\nbearings, 35 mm bore diameter.\nBearings were tested at speeds of 6000 rpm and 8000 rpm, thrust loads from\n50 to 1000 Ibs., with a wide range of lubrication conditions, with and without\na simulated fatigue spall implanted on the inner-race ball track.\n\nAn accelero-\n\nmeter (frequency response to 50 KHz) mounted on the outer-race housing was used\nand proved to be an effective primary sensor for a bearing health-monitoring\nsystem.\nIt was concluded that a bearing monitor system based on detection and analysis\nof modulations of a fault-indicating bearing resonance frequency can provide a\nlow threshold of sensitivity.\n\nVery slight faults producing no detectable sig-\n\nnal by conventional methods can be detected by such a system.\n\nTest results\n\nand observations leading to this conclusion were as follows.\n1.\n\nThe passage of each ball over a pit or fault in the race surface produced\nan impact.\n\nA structural resonance of one of the bearing components was\n\nexcited to "ring" by these repetitive impacts.\n\nFor the standard-race 107H\n\nbearing, this was apparently the third-mode resonance of the inner race,\nat a frequency of 28 KHz.\n2.\n\nA faulted bearing produced bursts of 28 KHz signal at a rate equal to the\nball-passing frequency for the inner race, giving the signal the appearance\nof amplitude modulation.\n\n3.\n\nThe raw signal from the faulted bearing contained no detectable component\nat inner-race ball-passing frequency.\n\nThis frequency could be detected by\n\nspectrum analysis after the 28 KHz signal had been "demodulated" or\nenvelope-detected.\n\nVI\n\n4.\n\nThe frequency of the fault-indicating signal was essentially unaffected\nby changes of load and speed.\n\nIn the unfaulted bearing, the amplitude\n\ndid not vary with load and increased slightly with speed.\n5.\n\nThe average amplitude at 28 KHz in a faulted bearing was from 12 to 50\ntimes greater than in the unfaulted bearing.\n\n6.\n\nDifferences in ball-track surface condition of standard-race bearings\ncould be inferred by comparing peak and average levels of the envelopedetected 24 KHz resonant frequency.\n\n7.\n\nLong operating life caused increased amplitude at high frequency.\n\nHowever,\n\nthis was of uniform amplitude characteristic of general wear and roughness,\nnot the modulated amplitude expected from discrete faults.\nFurther conclusions resulting from the test program are as follows.\n1.\n\nA "heavy-race" bearing designed specifically for the CMC application had\ndifferent resonant frequencies.\n\nThe dominant frequency produced by heavy-\n\nrace bearings was dependent on thrust load, varying from 34 KHz to 58 KHz.\nThe load-independent resonant frequency of the heavy-race bearing was 15 KHz,\n2.\n\nIndications were seen that the fault-indicating resonance frequency of a\nbearing race will vary when different mounting or installation means are\nemployed.\n\n3.\n\nEvidence was encountered that nonuniform signal attenuation over the\nfrequency-range of interest may result when an accelerometer must be installed on the exterior of large, complex structure wherein the monitored\nbearing is installed.\n\n4.\n\nA qualitative indication of lubricant starvation was noted in that\nvibration amplitudes at all prominent frequencies increased notably when\na minimal oil flow was interrupted.\n\nA system to detect the presence of fatigue spalls, brinelling and general\nroughness of balls and races at a very low threshold level was successfully\ndeveloped.\n\nFurther development and expansion of the system is still required\n\nto detect and provide early warning of inadequate lubrication and ball-retainer\ndistress.\n\nv if\n\n1\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRolling-element bearings have been in use for many years, and have proven to\nbe reliable and long-lived when properly applied and installed.\n\nThis excellent\n\nrecord of service, together with continued improvement in materials, design,\nand lubrication technology, have led to more and more stringent application\nrequirements.\n\nThese requirements include higher loads, higher rotational\n\nspeeds, longer operating life, and, in some applications, restricted lubrication in high vacuum environments.\n\nThese\n\nrequirements are uniquely\n\nstringent for spin-axis bearings of gyroscopes aboard long-life space vehicles.\n\nThe space-vehicle gyroscope application has resulted in demands for very long\nlife under conditions where only minimal lubrication can be provided, and\nservicing or re-lubrication cannot be performed.\n\nIn addition, continued proper\n\noperation of the bearings is vital to the mission of the entire vehicle.\n\nUnder\n\nthese conditions, some accounting must be made for the possibility of failure\nof an individual bearing prior to mission completion, despite the excellent\nservice record of rolling-element bearings as a group.\n\nOne approach to this\n\nsituation is to provide a back-up gyroscope aboard the vehicle with the intent\nof starting it and shutting down the primary unit if the bearings show signs of\ndistress.\n\nImplementation of this plan requires a device or system which can detect\nimpending failure of a bearing, prior to the point where the bearing can no\nlonger meet its design operating requirements.\n\nFor many industrial applications,\n\nthese requirements are rather loose, and admit relatively severe deterioration\nof a bearing from the initial "new" condition.\n\nGyroscope applications, however,\n\nare more demanding and little degradation can occur before a faulty spin-axis\nbearing could jeopardize the function of the gyroscope.\n\nA fault-detection\n\nsystem with sensitivity meeting these demands was not available at the inception\nof the work reported herein.\n\nThis work was aimed at developing such a system.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nA test program was conducted with the objective of developing a method and\nequipment for on-line monitoring of installed ball-bearings to detect deterioration or impending failure of these bearings.\nThe program was aimed specifically at the spin-axis bearings of the Bendix ATM\nControl Moment Gyro (CMC) installed on the NASA Sky Lab Vehicle.\n\nThis was stated\n\nto be similar in internal geometry to a Harden 107H angular contact ball bearing,\n35 mm bore diameter.\nTarget criteria for the monitoring sensor and system were:\n1.\n\nSensor installation must not restrict normal operation of the bearing;\n\n2.\n\nThe sensor and system should produce positive indications of a bearing\nfault or deterioration well before the bearing ceases to perform its\ndesign function;\n\n3.\n\nThe system output or indicating signal should vary with the state of\nbearing deterioration to permit predictions of remaining operational life;\n\n4.\n\nThe sensor and system should ideally be unaffected by bearing operating\nvariables such as load, speed, temperature, etc.\n\nIt was desired that the system recognize and indicate the following specific\nconditions:\n1.\n\nBeginning of fatigue failure;\n\n2.\n\nBrinelling of bearing surfaces;\n\n3.\n\nFlooding or starving of lubricant;\n\n4.\n\nChange in the lubrication process from an elasto-hydrodynamic film to a\ncondition of intermittent contact at surface asperities.\n\nII-\n\nSUMMARY. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nA test program was conducted with the objective of developing a method and\nequipment for on-line monitoring of installed ball-bearings to detect deterioration or impending failure of these bearings.\n\nThe program was aimed specifi-\n\ncally at the spin-axis bearings of the Bendix ATM Control Moment Gyro\ninstalled on the NASA Sky Lab vehicle.\n\n(CMC)\n\nThese were essentially Barden 107H\n\nangular contact ball bearings, 35 mm bore diameter.\nThree standard class 7, 107H bearings were tested at speeds of 6000 rpm and\n8000 rpm, thrust loads from 50 to 1000 Ibs., with a wide range of lubrication\nconditions.\n\nOne of the test bearings had a simulated fatigue spall implanted\n\non the inner-race ball track.\na wide diversity of sensors.\n\nDuring tests, data signals were recorded from\nAnalyses of these data revealed that ultrasonic\n\nvibrations were the only means by which the implanted fault could be reliably\ndetected.\n\nA high-frequency response accelerometer mounted on the outer-race\n\nhousing provided the most informative signal of all sensors used.\n\nResults\n\nfrom these tests were as follows.\n1.\n\nThe 107H bearing produced an ultrasonic vibration frequency of 28 KHz\nwhich was an effective fault indicator.\n\n2.\n\nThe frequency of the fault-indicating signal remained relatively constant\nwhen load and speed were changed.\n\nIn the unfaulted bearing, the amplitude\n\ndid not vary with load and increased only slightly with speed.\n3.\n\nThe average amplitude at 28 KHz in a faulted bearing was from 12 to 50\ntimes greater than in the unfaulted bearing.\n\n4.\n\nThe faulted bearing produced bursts of 28 KHz signal at a rate equal to\nthe ball-passing frequency for the inner race, giving the signal the appearance of amplitude modulation.\n\n5.\n\nThe raw signal from the faulted bearing contained no detectable component\nat inner-race ball-passing frequency.\n\nThis frequency could be detected by\n\nspectrum analysis only after the 28 KHz signal had been "demodulated" or\nenvelope-detected.\n6.\n\nIt was concluded that the passage of each ball over the implanted pit or\nfault produced an impact.\n\nThe 28 KHz was a structural resonance of one of\n\nthe bearing components which was excited to "ring" by these repetitive impacts.\n\n7.\n\nIt was also concluded that a bearing monitor system based on detection and\nanalysis of modulations of the fault-indicating resonance frequency would\nprovide a very low threshold of sensitivity.\n\nVery slight faults producing\n\nno detectable raw signal at ball-pass frequency can be readily detected by\nsuch a system.\nA Bearing Fault Detector based on the above concept and the 28 KHz frequency\nwas built and delivered to NASA for use with the 107H bearing.\n\nField measure-\n\nments of vibration were made on 6 CMC flight units, 2 Inner Gimbal Rotor Assemblies, and 6 Life Test Fixtures.\n\nThe data were used to establish a qualitative\n\nranking of these units, which is included in Appendix B of this report.\n\nFurther\n\nconclusions from these tests were:\n8.\n\nLong operating life caused an increased vibration amplitude at high\nfrequency.\n\nHowever, it was a uniform amplitude, characteristic of general\n\nwear and roughness, and not the modulated amplitude expected from discrete\nfaults.\n9.\n\nSome of the CMC bearings exhibited a "squeal" phenomenon associated with\nthe phenolic ball retainer.\n\nThe squeal frequencies of 900 Hz and 3100 Hz\n\nwere believed to be symptoms of retainer distress.\nA series of resonance tests were made on the balls and races of the 107H\nbearing in an attempt to identify the source of the 28 KHz frequency.\n\nCon-\n\nclusions from these tests were:\n10.\n\nThe third-mode resonance of the inner race was the most probable source\nof the 28 KHz.\n\n11.\n\nThe ball-contact resonance was not the source of 28 KHz;ball-contact\nresonant frequency increased markedly with load, from 30 KHz to 37 KHz.\n\n12.\n\nBoth inner and outer races exhibited several other resonant frequencies\nin the range from 13 KHz to 47 KHz.\n\n13.\n\nResonant vibration of the inner race was apparently transmitted through\nthe balls, the outer race, and the outer-race housing to the sensing\nnccelerometer during tests on the rotating spindle.\n\nBearings were mounted on a different test spindle ("endurance rig") and run at\n4000 rpm under high thrust load with intent to produce fatigue failure, and\n\nobserve the change of 28 KHz vibration during the progress of the failure.\nResults and conclusions were as follows:\n14.\n\nThe fault-indicating frequency of the 107H bearing shifted from 28KHz\nto 24 KHz when installed on the "endurance" test rig.\n\n15.\n\nEvaluation of the monitoring technique and its ability to provide early\nwarning of failure was inconclusive due to the shift of fault-indicating\nfrequency.\n\nThere is partial evidence that the technique would have suc-\n\nceeded had 24 KHz been monitored.\n16.\n\nThe more probable failure mode for the 107H CMC bearing is ball-retainer\nfailure due to inadequate lubrication.\n\nFatigue failure producing discrete\n\nspalls or faults is less likely under marginal lubrication conditions.\nFurther tests were performed in the endurance rig to identify the fault-indicating\nfrequency and signal levels of several bearings, including the special "heavyrace" bearings built specifically for the CMC.\n\nQualitative ranking of these\n\nbearings was formulated and included herein, based on data from these endurancerig tests.\n\nThe additional endurance-rig tests produced the following results\n\nand conclusions.\n17.\n\nThe fault-indicating resonant frequency of the standard-race bearing\ndefinitely shifted from 28 KHz to 24 KHz when installed in the endurance\nrig.\n\nThe shift was apparently caused by some aspect of the inner-race\n\nmounting on the test-rig spindle.\n18.\n\nDifferences in ball-track surface condition of standard-race bearings\ncould be inferred by comparing peak and average levels of the envelopedetected 24 KHz resonant frequency.\n\n19.\n\nThe dominant frequency produced by heavy-race bearings on the endurance\nrig was strongly dependent on thrust load, varying from 34 KHz at 50 Ib.\nload up to 58 KHz at 1000 Ib. load.\n\n20.\n\nThe load-independent resonant frequency of the heavy-race bearing on the\nendurance rig was 15 KHz.\n\nFinal te?ts consisted of running four heavy-race bearings in a Life. Test Fixture,\nand comparing the data with that from the same four bearings run on the endurance\nrig.\n\nResults and conclusions were as follows:\n\n21.\n\nThe massive bearing-housing structure of the LTF acted as a high-pass filter.\nThis caused severe attenuation of the load-independent 15 KHz fault-indicating\nfrequency of the heavy-race bearing compared to endurance-rig results.\n\nThe\n\nload-dependent component (34 KHz to 58 KHz) was attenuated much less.\nRecommendations\nThe objectives of the program have been partially achieved; a means of detecting\nsurface defects such as fatigue spalls or Brinell marks was developed.\n\nA course of\n\naction to achieve the remaining objectives is discussed below.\nAttention must be concentrated on the mode of bearing failure in which the ball\nretainer is apparently the key element.\n\nField measurements on CMC\'s conducted\n\nduring this program indicate that the ball retainer encounters distress; the testto-failure resulted in a large increase in bearing torque apparently due to retainer\nfailure.\n\nThis increase in torque apparently has been the prevalent failure mode\n\nplaguing the CMC units aboard the Skylab.\n\nThe tests reported herein indicate that\n\nretainer failure is caused by or related to marginal lubricant supply.\n\nTherefore,\n\nthe following work is recommended.\n1.\n\nDetermine which type of bearing is most widely used in CMC units, the standardrace or the heavy-race bearing.\n\nConfine further testing to the more prevalent\n\ntype of bearing.\n2.\n\nConduct further operational bearing tests to accurately define the nature of the\nchange in vibration behavior which occurs during the course of retainer deterioration.\n\nThe number of variables must be minimized to insure positive achievement\n\nwithin the constraints of a realistic budget and schedule.\n\nTests should be run\n\nat constant load and speed identical to those of the CMC application. (Thrust load\nis probably not a determining variable affecting retainer failure, whereas speed\nand the consequent rubbing velocities and inertial forces within the bearing undoubtedly are determining factors in retainer failure.)\n\nThe single operating\n\nvariable should be the lubrication condition.\n3.\n\nA definition of "bearing failure" must be formulated:\n\na key performance variable\n\nmust be identified and a quantitative threshold of acceptance established which\nrepresents the boundary of a "failure" condition.\ncertainly be bearing torque.\nthe recommended tests.\nchanges in torque.\n\nFor the CMC bearing, this must\n\nConsequently, this variable should be measured during\n\nChanges in vibration behavior must then be correlated with\n\nWhen this is accomplished, a "yardstick" of bearing accepta-\n\nbility and/or future life can be defined in terms of the measured vibration\nbehavior.\n\nA diagnostic system to implement this measuring scheme can then be\n\nfabricated.\n\nIII.\n\nINITIAL ROTATING SPINDLE TESTS\n\nThe work reported herein evolved through four phases:\nPhase\n\nI\n\n-\n\nfirst rotating spindle tests and construction of a\nprototype failure-detection and diagnostic system\n\nPhase\n\nII\n\n-\n\nfield tests of gyroscope units\n\nPhase III\n\n-\n\ninvestigation of resonances of bearing races and balls\n\nPhase\n\n-\n\ncontinued tests and development of diagnostic technique\n\nIV\n\nThe first tests were run on a spindle previously installed at MTI as part of\na Hybrid Boost Bearing test rig.\n\nThis spindle could be operated at speeds\n\nequal to that of the gyroscope wheel, and under thrust loads greater than\nthat experienced by the gyroscope bearings.\n\nActual gyroscope bearings were\n\nnot immediately available for testing, so the closest commercial equivalent\nbearings were obtained for these first tests.\nABEC grade 7.\n\nThese were Barden 107H bearings,\n\nThe characteristics of this test bearing are tabulated in\n\nAppendix A-l.\n\nNo effort was made during these first tests to produce actual fatigue failure.\nIt was assumed that the onset of fatigue failure would be embodied in a first\ndiscrete fatigue spall or pit.\n\nThis could be simulated by implanting a dis-\n\ncontinuity in the surface of the ball track of the inner race, where fatigue\nfailure would probably first occur.\n\nThis would also approximate a single\n\nBrinell mark.\n\nTest Conditions\nThree new, standard 107H bearings were tested sequentially on a laboratory test\nspindle under varied operating conditions.\n\nAppendix A-2 is an assembly drawing\n\nof the spindle, and Appendix A-3 is a photograph of the spindle.\n\nOne of the\n\n107H bearings was tested both before and after a simulated fatigue spall was\nimplanted on the ball track of the inner race.\nof the implanted fault.\n\nAppendix A-4 shows the nature\n\nThe test conditions consisted of combinations of the following values:\nRadial Load\nIbs.\n\nThrust Load\nIbs.\n\nShaft\nLubrication Conditions\n\n50\n\n250\n\n15\n\n(constant)\n\n6000\n8000\n\n1000\n\n(Esso 2389 Turbo Oil, MIL-L-7808)\na.\nb.\nc.\n\nfull flow ( . gpm)\n01\nno flow\ndry, washed in solvent\n\nMeasured Variables and Sensors\nIn order to identify sensors capable of detecting bearing condition, all of\nthe measurement sensors listed below were employed during all tests.\n\nVariable\n\n1.

Wyle Laboratories, Huntsville, Alabama\n3.\n\nBendix Corporation, Teterboro, New Jersey\n\nMeasuring Sensors\nThe following measuring sensors were employed during these tests:\n1.\n\nHigh-frequency accelerometer - Bruel and Kjaer Model 4344 (newly\navailable, to replace the previously used Wilcoxon sensor);\n\n2.\n\nLow-frequency accelerometers - for measuring vibration at rotational\nand twice-rotational\n\n3.\n\nfrequencies;\n\nMicrophone - inserted inside the port in the CMC cover.\n\nResults and Conclusions\nTwo significant facts emerged from these tests and the resulting data.\n1.\n\nThose gyro bearings which had experienced many hours of operation did\nshow relatively higher vibration amplitudes in the high frequency\nrange.\n\nHowever, it was a uniform high amplitude, characteristic of\n\ngeneral wear, and not the modulated amplitude expected from discrete\nfaults.\n2.\n\nDeterioration of the phenolic ball retainer appeared to be a more\ncommon failure mode for the CMC bearings.\n\nSymptoms of this failure\n\nwere noted in several of the units tested.\n\nThe symptoms were signi-\n\nficant responses at 900 Hz and 3100 Hz in the vibration spectrum and\nin the audible airborne-noise spectrum.\n\nThese symptoms could not be\n\ndetected by the Bearing Fault Detector, which responded only to\n28 KHz.\n\n12\n\nA qualitative ranking of performance was established for all of the tested\nunits, based on the amplitudes of the following components of the measured\nnoise and vibration data.\n1.\n\nRotational frequency - rotor balance;\n\n2.\n\nTwice rotational frequency - bearing misalignment, possibly due to\ngimbal supports;\n\n3.\n\n900 Hz and 3100 Hz - ball-retainer\n\ncondition;\n\n4.\n\n20 KHz to 30 KHz - condition of ball-track

August,\n\n1973.\n\n13\n\nV.\n\nBALL AND RACE RESONANCE TESTS\n\nThe work of Phase III consisted of laboratory tests aimed at identifying the\nsource of the 28 KHz fault-indicating signal observed during Phase I bearing\ntests.\n\nIt had been surmised during Phase I that this frequency was related\n\nto the mass of a ball and the stiffness of the supporting contact between the\nball and races.\n\nA test program was devised to examine the validity of this\n\npremise.\n\nResonance Test Fixture\nA ball was to be clamped between two surfaces under a controlled compressive\nforce, and subjected to vibratory excitation by a piezoelectric crystal.\nexcitation frequency would be swept through a range up to 100 KHz.\n\nThe\n\nThe rela-\n\ntive response amplitude would be measured with

cell.\n\nThe load was mea-\n\nThis test fixture is shown assembled in\n\nFigure 6, and disassembled in Figure 7.\n\nAfter testing the ball for resonant\n\nfrequencies, the inner and outer races of the 107H bearing were tested in a\nsimilar manner, as indicated in Figure 8.\nThe intent of these tests was two-fold:\n1.\n\nto identify resonant frequencies inherent to the specific bearing\ncomponents;\n\n2.\n\nto determine whether or not these frequencies varied with bearing\nload.\n\nThe load imposed on the ball by the test fixture was very similar to that\nwhich the ball experiences in the assembled bearing.\n\nHowever, the diametral\n\nload imposed on the races by the fixture was not truly representative of the\nload conditions which arise from a thrust load in an assembled bearing.\n\nThe\n\nfrequency-load relationships indicated by the tests on the races are therefore\nnot conclusively definitive.\n\n14\n\nResults\nThe results from these resonance tests are shown in Figure 9 as plots of\nresonant frequency versus load.\n\nThe resonant frequency of the ball increased\n\nwith load from 30 KHz up to 37 KHz.\n\nThis did not agree with the load-invariant\n\n28 KHz frequency observed during bearing tests.\n\nIt was concluded that the fault-\n\nindicating 28 KHz was not due to ball resonance.\n\nSeveral resonances were identi-\n\nfied in both the inner and outer races, as shown in Figures 10 and 11.\n\nThe third\n\nmode of the inner race and the fifth mode of the outer race both occurred between\n26 KHz and 27 KHz and appeared to be possible sources of the 28 KHz signal of\ninterest.\nThe race resonances were further explored by a method illustrated in Figures 10\nand 11.\n\nThe bearing outer race was mounted in the housing of the bearing test\n\nrig, as shown in Figure 10.\n\nOne accelerometer was mounted on the I.D. of the\n\nrace as a "driver" and excited with a signal generator.\nwas mounted on the O.D. of the housing as a sensor.\n\nA second accelerometer\n\nThe driver frequency was\n\nthen swept through the range of interest, and the relative response amplitude at\nthe sensor was recorded.\n\nA similar procedure was performed on the inner race,\n\nwhen mounted on the bearing-test-rig fixture shown in Figure 8.\nbearing was also tested in this manner.\n\nAn assembled\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 12.\n\nConclusions\nIt is apparent in the data of Figure 12 that the resonances of the separate\nraces are somewhat altered when assembled in the bearing.\n\nThis introduced some\n\nconfusion in the results, and positive conclusions could not be drawn.\n\nHowever,\n\nit was tentatively concluded that the 28 KHz fault-indicating frequency was a\nresonance of the inner race.\n\nNo explanation could be conceived as to why that\n\nparticular resonant frequency had dominated the vibration spectrum of the bearing when operated under load on the test spindle.\nThe results of Phase III work can be summarized in the following conclusions.\n1.\n\nThe .310 inch diameter ball of the 107H bearing has a contact resonance\nwhich varies in frequency from 30 KHz to 37 KHz, depending on the compressive load.\n\n15-\n\n2.\n\nThe ball-contact resonance was not the source of the fault-indicating\n28 KHz signal observed during rotating bearing tests.\n\n3.\n\nThe outer race of the 107H standard bearing exhibited several resonant\nfrequencies in the range from 13 KHz to 45 KHz, which varied only slightly\nwith load, but none of which appeared to be the source of the 28 KHz in the\nassembled bearing.\n\n4.\n\nThe inner race also exhibited several resonances, the third mode resonance\nappearing to be the most likely source of the 28 KHz noted during rotating\ntests.\n\n5.\n\nResonant vibration of the inner race was apparently transmitted through\nthe balls, the outer race, and the outer-race housing to the sensing accelerometer during tests on the rotating spindle.\n\n16\n\nVI.\n\nTESTS-TO-FAILURE\n\nIN ENDURANCE RIG\n\nPhase IV included three activities listed below.\n1.\n\nRotating tests-to-failure of three standard-race 107H bearings, sequentially\nmounted on an "endurance" rig;\n\n2.\n\nRotating tests of four standard-race bearings and four "heavy-race" bearings\nin the endurance rig, to identify the fault-indicating frequency and signal\nlevel at these frequencies;\n\n3.\n\nRotating tests in a Bendix LTF (Life Test Fixture) of four heavy-race\nbearings, and comparison with similar tests in the "endurance" rig, to\nassess signal attenuation caused by LTF structure.\n\nEndurance Test Rig\nThe tests-to-failure were run on the "endurance" rig, which was a different test\nspindle than that used for the initial Phase I tests.\n\nThe spindle is shown sche-\n\nmatically in Figure 13, and Figure 14 is a close-up photo of the active spindle.\nThe test instrumentation for the endurance tests-to-failure is shown in Figure 15,\nThe rig contained three spindles, only one of which was used.\n\nThe spindle was\n\nlimited to a maximum speed of 5000 rpm, and the tests were run at about 4000 rpm.\n\nInstrumentation\nA Bruel and Kjaer Model 4344 miniature accelerometer was stud-mounted to the\nouter-race housing of the test bearing, as shown in Figures 13 and 14.\n\nThe\n\noutput signal was routed to the following processors:\n\nProcessor\nPeak Meter\n\nPeak amplitude of raw signal\n\n28 KHz band-pass filter to\npeak meter and rms meter\n\nPeak and average amplitudes of filtered\nsignal\n\nEnvelope

Figure 16.\n\nThe raw signal total peak-to-peak amplitude displayed the same characteristic\nhistory and was equally as informative as any of the band-pass filtered or\nenvelope-detected signals.\n\n2.\n\nNone of the recorded signals provided an identifiable "early warning" of the\n"seizures" which occurred during this test.\n\nThird Test\nA third test bearing was installed on the spindle directly from its sealed\npackage.\n\nNo lubrication was added.\n\nThis bearing "seized" almost immediately.\n\nExamination revealed stripes of phenolic retainer material on balls and races.\n\nDiscussion of Results of Second Test\nFrequency spectrum plots of the raw accelerometer signal were made periodically\nduring the test-to-failure of bearing S/N 6.\n\nFour of these are shown in Figure 17,\n\nIt is apparent from these plots that the fault-indicating frequency during this\ntest was between 23 KHz and 25 KHz, and not at 28 KHz.\n\nThe shape of the 28 KHz\n\nfilter was such that a 24 KHz signal would be attenuated to about one-fifth of\nits initial amplitude.\n\nConsequently, the results of this test were inconclusive,\n\nso far as providing data for evaluating the condition-monitoring technique.\n\nA\n\n19\nreview of all the frequency spectrum plots taken during the test does lead to\nthe tentative conclusion that a more rapid rise in amplitude at 24 KHz did\noccur near the end of the test.\n\nThis might have provided an "early warning"\n\nof failure if this frequency had been continuously monitored.\n\nThe shift of\n\nthe fault-indicating frequency during the tests-to-failure will be further\ndiscussed in the next section.\n\nConclusions from Tests-to-Failure\nIn summary, the following conclusions were drawn from the results of the\ntests-to-failure of the 107H CMC ball bearing.\n1.\n\nThe fault-indicating frequency of the 107H bearing was shifted from\n28 KHz to 24 KHz when installed on the "endurance" test rig.\n\n2.\n\nEvaluation of the condition monitoring technique and its ability to provide\nearly warning of failure was inconclusive, since the wrong frequency was\nmonitored.\n\nThere is partial evidence that the technique would have suc-\n\nceeded if 24 KHz had been monitored.\n3.\n\nThe more probable failure mode for the 107H CMC bearing is ball-retainer\nfailure due to inadequate lubrication.\n\nThis will cause wear of the phenolic\n\nretainer, build-up of phenolic debris in the ball tracks, excessive bearing\ntorque, and general roughening of ball and race surfaces.\n\nFatigue failure\n\nproducing discrete spalls or faults will probably not occur unless very\nlong operation occurs under conditions of good lubrication.\n\n20\n\nVII.\n\nFURTHER TESTS IN THE "ENDURANCE" RIG\n\nFour samples of the 107H "standard-race" bearing were tested on the endurance\nrig to identify the fault-indicating frequency.\n\nIn addition, four special\n\n"heavy-race" bearings were similarly tested.\n\nTest Procedure\nThe test procedure was as follows.\n1.\n\nMount the accelerometer (B & K 4344) radially on the bearing outer-race\nadaptor, with a mounting stud.\n\n2.\n\nLubricate the test bearing with several drops of TURBO-S-OIL No. 15.\nApply thrust load to the bearing and run the spindle to the desired speed\n( 0 0 rpm or 5000 rpm). Wait for warm-up and steady operation.\n40\n\n3.\n\nUsing the transient recorder and real-time analyzer, plot the frequency\nspectrum of the raw signal.\n\nThe spectrum will indicate the predominant\n\nfault generated resonance frequency.\n4.\n\nMeasure the raw signal amplitude with a peak meter.\n\n5. = Set the center frequency of a band-pass filter at the fault-generated\nresonance frequency as indicated by the spectrum.\n\nMeasure the filtered\n\noutput peak value and average value.\n6.\n\nFeed the filtered high frequency signal into an envelope detector.\n\nUse\n\nthe real-time analyzer to plot the frequency spectrum of the envelope signal.\nMeasure the peak value and DC level of the envelope.\n7.\n\nPass the envelope signal through a low frequency band-pass filter.\ncenter frequency at the precalculated ball pass frequency.\n\nSet the\n\nMeasure the\n\nfiltered output peak value and average value.\nThe installation for these tests was identical to that for the tests-to-failure,\nshown in Figure 14.\n\n21\n\nTests of Standard-Race Bearings\nThe signal levels recorded during these tests of standard-race bearings are\npresented in Tables I thoough IV.\n\nFrequency spectrum plots of the raw and\n\nenvelope-detected signals from bearing serial number 3 are shown in Figure 18.\nThis was the identical faulted bearing which was used during Phase I tests\nand which produced the 28 KHz fault-indicating frequency.\n\nIt is apparent in\n\nFigure 18 that the load-independent, fault-indicating frequency was 24 KHz.\n\nA\n\ncomponent at 36 KHz was prominent at 50 Ib. load, but this frequency appeared\nto shift upward as the load was increased.\n\nFrequency spectrum plots for bear-\n\nings S/N 4, S/N 9, and S/N 10 were similar in frequency content, though much\nlower in amplitude since they were not faulted as was S/N 3.\n\nShift of Fault-Indicating Frequency from 28 KHz to 24 KHz\nResonance tests were run on the outer-race housing used on the endurance rig\nin an effort to identify the cause or source of the new 24 KHz resonant frequency.\n\nThe bearing outer race installed in the endurance-rig housing did\n\nnot display a resonant frequency in the range 23 KHz to 26 KHz.\n\nBearing S/N 3\n\nwas operated on another small test spindle and again produced 28 KHz, but not\n24 KHz.\n\nIt can be noted in Table I that the amplitude of the 24 KHz component decreased\nconsistently with increasing thrust load.\n\nOn the Phase I test spindle, the\n\n28 KHz amplitude from a faulted bearing increased with load.\n\nThere was one\n\naspect of the endurance rig which could account for this different behavior;\nthe inner-race mounting adapter was secured to the spindle on a taper, as shown\nin Figure 13.\n\nIncreased thrust load therefore tended to tighten the fit of the\n\nadapter in the inner race and onto the spindle, also.\n\nThe Phase I test spindle\n\nhad no taper fits, so that radial fits were unaffected by thrust load.\n\nIt was\n\ntherefore concluded that some aspect of the inner-race mounting on the endurancerig spindle shifted the inner-race resonance from 28 KHz to 24 KHz, and caused\nthe differeiit behavior under increasing thrust load.\n\nRanking of Standard-Race Bearings\nThe data from Tables I through IV were used to rank the condition of the four\nstandard-race bearings as follows.\n\n22\n1.\n\nS/N 10 -- best\n\nslight roughness, trace indication of\ndiscrete faults\n\n2.\n\nS/N 9 \xe2\x80\x94\n\nsame surface characteristic as S/N 10\n\n3.\n\nS/N 4 \xe2\x80\x94 poorer\n\ngeneral roughness about the same as S/N\'s 9\nand 10; indication of discrete faults definitely stronger\n\n4.\n\nS/N 3 \xe2\x80\x94 bad\n\ndominant indication of discrete fault;\n(this was the faulted test bearing)\n\nslight margin\nbelow S/N 10\n\nThe above statements concerning surface condition of the test bearings are\nbased solely on the peak, average, and DC values given in Tables I through IV.\nGenerally speaking, for diagnostic purposes, the peak and average values of a\nfiltered signal at the resonance frequency are adequate to discriminate a bad\nbearing from a good one.\n\nHigh peak value is an indication of discrete fatigue\n\nspalls or large-particle retainer debris on the contact surfaces.\n\nHigh average\n\nvalue is an indication of distributed roughness of contact surfaces due to\ngeneral wear or small-size debris accumulation.\n\nThe peak and DC levels of the\n\nenvelope-detected signal are redundant information.\n\nThe filtered envelope peak\n\nvalue at different ball-pass frequencies can be used to identify the location\nof faults in the bearing.\n\nAs mentioned before, for the 107 bearings, the ball-pass\n\nfrequency for a discrete spall on the inner race is 8.7 times inner-race rotational speed.\na ball;\n\nIt is 6 times inner-race rotational frequency if the fault is on\n\nit is 6.3 times rotational frequency if the fault is on the outer race.\n\nHeavy-Race Bearings\nThe CMC was designed to use a special version of the 107H bearing which had\nlarger inner and outer races, and is designated here as the "heavy-race" bearing.\n\nSection drawings of the standard and heavy-race configurations are shown\n\nin Figure 19 for comparison.\n\nIt is apparent therein that the race structures\n\nare sufficiently different that the resonant behavior and frequencies would be\ndissimilar.\nTwo heavy-race bearings were tested on the endurance rig to identify the faultindicating frequency; bearing S/N 3 was deliberately faulted on the inner race\nin a similar fashion as was the standard bearing of Phase I.\ndure was identical to that employed for standard bearings.\n\nThe test proce-\n\nThe recorded signal\n\n23\n\nlevels are tabulated in Tables V through VIII.\n\nTwo additional heavy-race\n\nbearings were removed from Life Test Fixture unit number 5 and tested on the\nendurance rig as part of the LTF test series.\n\nResults of these tests are pre-\n\nsented in the next section.\n\nFault-Indicating Frequencies of Heavy-Race Bearings\nFrequency spectrum plots of the raw signal from the faulted bearing (S/N 3)\nand the used bearing (S/N 4) at speeds of 4000 rpm and 5000 rpm at five different loads are shown in Figure 20.\nThree resonant peaks are prominent in these plots:\na.\n\n7 KHz - considered too low for diagnostic use, since it is within\nthe range of much machinery noise;\n\nb.\n\n14-16 KHz - frequency varies slightly with thrust load, amplitude\nincreases with speed; appears to be the best fault indicator;\n\nc.\n\n35 KHz - frequency increases significantly with thrust load, goes\nup to 58 KHz at 1000 Ib. load.\n\nA band-pass filter and the envelope-detector were utilized to assess the\nmodulation of these frequencies.\n\nFrequency spectrum plots of the envelope-\n\ndetected signal at 4000 rpm at 15 \xc2\xb1 1 KHz and at the load-dependent frequency\n(35 KHz to 58 KHz) are shown in Figure 21.\n\nThe inner-race ball-pass frequency\n\nis clearly evident in the envelope-detected 15 KHz component from the faulted\nbearing, and is not evident in the comparable signal from the "used" bearing.\nModulation of the 35 to 58 KHz frequency apparently becomes stronger with increasing thrust load for the faulted bearing, but is relatively weak__in the\nused bearing.\nTables V and VI are the recorded signal levels from the faulted and used\nbearings, based on the 15 KHz fault-indicating frequency.\n\nTables VII and VIII\n\nare similar data based on the load-dependent frequency, wherein the filter center frequency was shifted with load to follow this frequency.\n\nIn both sets of\n\ndata the faulted bearing produces much higher levels than the used bearing in\nall types of signal.\n\nThe ratios of peak-to-average signal are roughly comparable\n\nfor both the used and faulted bearings.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that what-\n\never faults exist in the used bearing have the nature of discrete faults.\n\n24\n\nConclusions\nThe additional tests in the endurance rig lead to the following conclusions.\n1.\n\nThe fault-indicating resonant frequency of the standard-race bearing\ndefinitely shifts from 28 KHz to 24 KHz when installed in this rig, since\nfour different bearings gave similar results.\n\n2.\n\nThe shift in frequency is apparently produced by some aspect of the innerrace mounting on the test-rig spindle.\n\n3.\n\nDifferences in ball-track surface condition of standard-race bearings can\nbe inferred by comparing peak and avearge levels of the envelope-detected\n24 KHz resonant frequency.\n\n4.\n\nThe dominant frequency produced by heavy-race bearings on the endurance\nrig was strongly dependent on thrust load, varying from 34 KHz at 50 Ib.\nload up to 58 KHz at 1000 Ib. load.\n\n5.\n\nThe load-independent resonant frequency of the heavy-race bearing on the\nendurance rig was 15 KHz.\n\nThe amplitude at this frequency was an effective\n\nindicator of an implanted discrete fault.\n\n25\n\nVIII.\n\nTESTS IN THE LIFE-TEST FIXTURE\n\nThe final tests of the program were run on a Bendix CMC Life Test Fixture,\nP/N 2123570, provided by NASA.\n\nThis LTF unit incorporates the CMC bearings,\n\na shaft, and spin motor in an enclosure which can be evacuated for high-speed\noperation.\n\nThe bearings are mounted in six-sided aluminum plates, 2 inches\n\nthick, 14 inches maximum length.\n\nAn accelerometer for sensing bearing vibra-\n\ntion could only be mounted on the outer edge of these large plates.\n\nThe vi-\n\nbration would therefore have to traverse several interfaces at mounting fits\nand then the radial length of the heavy mounting plates.\n\nIt was anticipated\n\nthat this signal transmission path would impose significant impedance and\ncause some attenuation.\n\nIt was proposed that these effects be assessed by\n\ncomparative tests of identical bearings in the LTF and in the endurance rig.\n\nTest Procedure\nThe LTF incorporated heavy-race bearings S/N 003 and S/N 012 when received at\nMil.\n\nProvision for mounting the sensing accelerometer was made on the edge\n\nsurface of the bearing housing plate at each end of the rig. Small aluminum\nplates 3/4 inch square by 1/4 inch thick were drilled and tapped for the accelerometer mounting stud.\n\nThese were then bonded to the LTF bearing housing\n\nplate at the desired location with cyano-acrylate adhesive.\n\nThe accelerometer\n\ncould then be stud-mounted on these plates, which were left in place throughout\nall LTF tests, so that no variability was introduced by re-cementing the plates.\nThe LTF was run at speeds of 4000 rpm and 9100 rpm. This provided data for\ncomparison with endurance-rig tests at 4000 rpm, and for comparison with data\nfrom CMC units, which are intended to run at about 9000 rpm. The spin motor\nwas energized with a CML MACARR Model T500B three-phase variable frequency\nconverter.\n\nThe LTF housing was evacuated during test runs to reduce windage\n\nlosses.\nAfter data were taken from the LTF with the original bearings (S/N 003 and\nS/N 012), these bearings were removed and replaced with heavy-race bearings\nS/N 3 and S/N 4, which had previously been tested on the endurance rig. The\noriginal LTF heavy-race bearings were subsequently tested on the endurance rig.\n\n26\n\nResults\nFrequency spectrum plots of the raw signal from one of the original bearings\n(S/N 003) of the LTF are shown in Figure 22, for operation in the LTF and in\nthe endurance rig.\n\nIt is apparent from these plots that the strong resonances\n\nbelow 20 KHz in the endurance rig are very greatly attenuated in the LTF.\n\nThe\n\nresonance between 32 KHz and 36 KHz becomes the dominant frequency in the LTF\nby a wide margin.\n\nIt appeared that the signal transmission path in the LTF\n\nstructure acted as a high-pass filter, and selectively attenuated frequencies\nbelow 20 KHz.\n\nSimilar frequency spectrum plots for the faulted bearing (S/N 3) are shown in\nFigure 23.\n\nThe same apparent high-pass filtering phenomenon is evident therein.\n\nTable IX presents a comparison of amplitudes of signals from endurance-rig and\nLTF tests of four heavy-race bearings at a speed of 4000 rpm.\n\nThese include\n\nthe two original LTF bearings (S/N 003 and S/N 012), plus the faulted and used\nalternates (S/N 3 and S/N 4).\n\nIt is clearly evident from this tabulation that\n\nthe signal is attenuated in the LTF, except for the faulted bearing.\n\nThis\n\nexception is an anomaly that could not be explained.\n\nTable X presents similar data for all four heavy-race bearings tested in the\nLTF at 9100 rpm.\n\nComparison with Table IX data for LTF tests indicates that\n\nall amplitudes increase with speed.\n\nThe data of Table X can also be used to\n\nrank the heavy-race bearings in the same manner that standard-race bearings\nwere ranked in the previous section.\n1.\n\nS/N 012\n\nbest condition (from "side 2" of the LTF)\n\n2.\n\nS/N 4\n\nslightly poorer (the "used" alternate bearing)\n\n3.\n\nS/N 003\n\nnotably poorer than 012 (from "side 1" of the LTF)\n\n4. S/N 3\n\npoorest (faulted with similated fatigue spall)\n\nThe same ranking could be inferred from the raw signal, the filtered signal,\nthe envelope-detected signal or the ball-pass frequency component of the envelope-detected signal.\n\nIt might be concluded from this fact that filtering\n\nand envelope detection were unnecessary signal processing.\n\nHowever, in many\n\nmonitoring situations, other machine components might be creating large-\n\n27\namplitude signals at several frequencies.\n\nFiltering to exclude all but a\n\npreferred frequency would certainly be necessary.\n\nIf unrelated components\n\nproduced frequencies within the pass-band of the filter, modulation on the\nenvelope-detected signal would allow positive identification of that vibration component and amplitude contributed by the bearing.\n\n28\n\nLIST OF TABLES\n\nTABLE\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nV\n\nVI\n\nVII\n\nVIII\n\nIX\n\nX\n\nPage\nEndurance Rig Test Data, Standard-Race Faulted
