The scientific objectives of the program are the planetological investigation of the moon and the use of the moon as a base for astronomical observations. It is argued that the development of a lunar base will assist in the advancement of science, the development of lunar resources to support space activities, and the development of a permanently, self-supported human colony away from the earth. The technological and operational capabilities needed in order to establish a lunar base are discussed.", "title": "Lunar base objectives and open questions", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T14:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880028878, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Duke, Michael B."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "305b8c1f107842d29a77bac40748ef70"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880028878, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880028878, "id": "cc317cf3879849b4b52b421c618ce3e4", "publicationDate": "1987-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
