The semi-autonomous paint removal\nsystem attaches itself magnetically to the hull of a\nship, with a vacuum hose running from it. A\ncontroller helps navigate the robot along the\nsurface of the ship with 360 degrees of movement.\nThe M-2000\xe2\x80\x99s high-pressure water jet generates\n40,000 pounds per square inch of pressure to blast\naway the paint right down to the ship\xe2\x80\x99s steel\nsubstrate.\nThe resulting by-product is nothing more than\nwater and dried paint chips, both of which are\ncaptured by the powerful vacuum system so no\ntoxic residues escape to pollute the environment.\nThe waste products are passed through a filtering\nsystem in a closed loop, extracting the paint from\nthe water into a container, and recycling the water.\nUsing robotics to remove paint is a major\nadvancement from the traditional method of paint\nstripping. Traditional grit blasting techniques\n\nrelease environmental contaminants via the toxic\ndust produced, placing workers at risk for injury. It\nis also more expensive, which is an important\nconsideration given the frequency ships need to be\nrepainted. By using recycled water, water usage is\nreduced and there is no costly grit removal to\nlandfills.\nOther benefits of UltraStrip\xe2\x80\x99s M-2000 extend\nbeyond preserving the environment. The robotic\nsystem is able to strip paint faster and remove\nmore contaminants from the paint surface, all at a\ncost savings over grit blasting. The M-2000\nremoves salt and surface contaminants at a rate\n200 percent greater than grit blasting. The result is\nimproved paint coat adhesion, extending the\ncoating life and reducing the need for constant\nrepainting. The shorter time spent in dry dock\nincreases profits for companies in the shipping\nindustry. The M-2000 requires as few as four\noperators to remove the six to twelve acres of paint\nsurface found on a typical supertanker, which also\nreduces the cost of labor and contributes to the\nreduced risk of injury.\nWhile this technology is going to market,\nimprovements are underway at JPL that will\nenhance the performance and reduce the time to\nremove the paint by at least 50 percent, using\nultrasound to blast the paint off while the water\n\nENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES MANAGEMENT\nCOMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFF\n\nThe diagram demonstrates the high-pressure water jet\nand vacuum pump that make UltraStrip Systems\xe2\x80\x99\nrobotic paint stripping system environmentally safe.\n\nremoves it. A brush sensor is also being developed\nto sense any paint residue, which will optimize the\nspeed of the operation while improving the quality\nof the paint removal.\nUltraStrip is currently working with shipyards\nfrom around the world to transition them to the M2000 system. The company is also already\nlooking into a second-generation of the\ntechnology to include computer vision,\nallowing the robot to adjust its course.\nSensors are also being developed to detect\nsurface quality, paint thickness, and\namounts of paint remaining on the hull.\n\nJean-Michel Cousteau, president of a non-profit\norganization dedicated to preserving the global\nwater system, seen here with the M-2000 has\npartnered with UltraStrip Systems to keep the\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s water ecosystems clean.\n\nNASA SPINOFF 2000\n\n51\n\n'
