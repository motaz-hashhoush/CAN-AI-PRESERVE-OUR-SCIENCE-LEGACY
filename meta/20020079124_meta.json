United Technology spun off a new company, Waterjet Systems, to commercialize and market the technology. The resulting ARMS (Automated Robotic Maintenance Systems), employ waterblasts at 55,000 pounds per square inch controlled by target-sensitive robots. The systems are used on aircraft and engine parts, and the newest application is on ships, where it not only strips but catches the ensuing wastewater. This innovation results in faster, cheaper stripping with less clean-up and reduced environmental impact.", "title": "Robotic Waterjet System", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020079124, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020079124, "id": "176afd0a57e54e11bcb4873bc07140a9", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1996", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020079124.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020079124/downloads/20020079124.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020079124/downloads/20020079124.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020079124/downloads/20020079124.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
