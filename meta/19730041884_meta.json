There are at least 14 different curve types. Common types are:  (a) reddish curves with 10% absorptions near 0.95 micron or beyond 1.0 micron, due to Fe(2+) in minerals such as pyroxenes; (b) flat curves in the visible and near-IR with sharp decreases in the UV and (c) flat curves even into the UV. Several asteroids show probable color variations with rotation, especially 6 Hebe. A sample of 102 asteroids  with reliably known colors is derived from the reflectivities and from earlier colorimetry. Several correlations of colors and spectral curve types with orbital and physical parameters are examined: (1) asteroids with large aphelia have flat reflectivities while those with small perihelia are mostly reddish, (2) curve types show evidence for clustering on an a vs e plot, with 0.95 micron bands occuring mainly for Mars-approaching  asteroids, (3) no strong correlation exists between color and either proper eccentricity or proper inclination.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "78", "submissionId": 19730041884, "id": "84395278af164e35ac3179b2c2c8d8e2", "publicationName": "Astronomical Journal", "publicationDate": "1973-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
