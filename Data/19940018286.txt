Before considering integration\nan understanding\nof the concept of interworking\nand how it can be\nachieved is necessary. The interworking\nin\nthis chapter is described on the ability of\nGSM network to interwork\nwith non-ISDN\nnetworks.\nThe concept of Bearer services was developed for the ISDN and has been extended to\nthe GSM.

Three areas of interworking\nwere\nidentified and thoroughly\ninvestigated:\n\nsystem. This, in no way, means that these\nare the only services which Standard-M\nsystem is capable of supporting.\n\n1.

Such messages\nwill be needed to\nindicate things like service nature (i.e simple\nor duplex), service type (i.e short message\nservice) etc. These signals can be accommodated since both MESs and LESs will be\nequipped\nwith software expansion\ncapabilities\nto accommodate\nnew signalling\n133\n\ncodes\n\nfor future\n\nInmarsat\n\nservice\n\noffer-\n\nings[3].

Appropriate\ninterfaces at the MSSC are\nrequired to support GSM services within\nStandard-M network e.g X.30 and X.31 to\nsupport packet data services.\n4. The MSSC must support all of GSM\nsupplementary\nservices.\n5. Additional\ninterworking\nfunctions (IWFs)\nwill be required to support various GSM\nservices. The IWFs will be in the following\nform:\ni) Echo\n\ncontrol\n\ndevices\n\nmode\n\nterminals\n\nfor both non-ISDN\n\nand\n\nISDN services are shown in figures 5 and 6\nrespectively.\nIn ISDN compatible\nterminal,\nthe GSM Mobile Termination\n1 (MT1) was\nconsidered,\nas MT1 is designed\nto support\nISDN user interface,\ni.e "S" reference\npoint,\nallowing\nTEl to be connected\ndirectly to\nMT1.
