There\nare also many reports of rocket measurements of plasma densities from which large particle fluxes have been inferred,\nseveral rocket flights in which significant fluxes of particles were measured directly, and several more rocket flights\nin which particle fluxes were inferred from the background\ncounts in instruments designed for other purposes.\nTheorists have proposed alternative mechanisms to explain\nexcess plasma densities and, of course, various experimenters\nhave proposed various mechanisms which would lead to incorrect flux measurements. Several of the investigators in this\nproject have been involved in these earlier efforts made at\ndifferent times and different locations.\nAt a meeting of the International Union of Geodesy and\nGeophysics in Grenoble in 1975, U.S. and Soviet scientists\nagreed that the first question to be resolved was instrument\ncredibility. Therefore, a joint measurement of the fluxes\nat the same time and place was the first step necessary to\nunderstand the apparently conflicting results in the scientific literature. Future steps could involve identification\nof location and conditions leading to precipitation and\nidentification of mechanisms to be tested.\nSCIENTIFIC CONSIDERATIONS AND COMPARISON CRITERIA\nObjectives\nThe primary objective of this intercalibration experiment is to establish the credibility of the following U.S.\nand Soviet instruments and designs used in the past to\ndirectly determine the existence of particles (electrons\nand/or protons) which would be responsible for ionizing the\nlower regions of the ionosphere at night.\n-more-\n\n-5\xe2\x80\xa2 Phosphor (a thermoluminescent dosimeter);\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Magnetic electron spectrometer ;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Solid state integral detectors ;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Electrostatic analyzer ; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Geiger counters .\nThis objective will be attained by:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Simultaneously measuring energetic particle fluxes\nwhich would be capable of causing ionization in the nighttime ionosphere between 100 and 180 kilometers (62 and 112\nmiles) with each of the instruments listed above;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Making confirmatory measurements of the effects of\nthese particles, i.e., ionization levels and optical\nemissionsj\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Making a latitudinal survey of any optical emissions\ncaused by particles;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Making an all-sky survey for any "patchiness" in the\nemissions caused by nonuniform precipitation of the particles\nin the vicinity of Wallops Center;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Measuring the ionization level at both Wallops Center\nand Arecibo, Puerto Rico, to determine the latitude variation\nof particle flux levels; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determining the particle fluxes on the same L shells\nat higher altitudes by utilizing data from satellites.\nSatellite data may also provide a means to observe the\nfluxes and their latitudinal changes of pitch angle distributions which occur during the time the vertical probe\n(rocket) data is obtained. From satellite data the changes\nin particle populations before and after the rocket launches\ncan also be followed. Additionally, the rockets will be\nlaunched over a two or three day interval to follow the time\ndevelopment at low altitudes not accessible to satellite.\n\n-more-\n\n-6-\n\nf\nScientific Considerations\n\nThis project represents a coordinated effort to bring\nU.S. and Soviet scientists and techniques together which\nheretofore have made disparate measurements from several\nlocations at separate times. This plan details the coordinated measurements required to overcome such deficiencies as:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Instrument malfunctions or imprecise understanding\nof instrument behavior and calibrations ;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Geographic differences ;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Differences owing to changing conditions with time ; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of ancillary measurements to help analyze results\nobtained airglow which must accompany particle fluxes\nwill be measured at Wallops Center and other locations\nin order to obtain an understanding of particle flux\nchanges with latitude and their spatial uniformity.\nPlasma densities will be measured along each of the\nrocket trajectories together with energetic particle fluxes.\nIon densities will also be obtained between the E and F\nregions. The possibility that observed "excess" ionization\nis not the result of particle impact, but due to dynamics\nof the wind systems, will be determined by both the in-situ\nparticle measurements and by observations of a trimethyl\naluminum (TMA) trail.\nThis material reacts with atomic oxygen to create a\nchemilumines-cence which can be seen at any time during a\nmoonless, clear night. This trail deforms if wind shears\nare present. Knowledge of the deformation rate permits\nwind speeds to be calculated. These data are also vital\nto our understanding of the intermediate layer.\nEach of the various particle instruments being flown\nwas selected for its part in the historical record. Some\ndesigns have previously been on spacecraft, others have\nbeen rocket borne. The rocket carrying the TMA will also\nrelease barium at apogee, permitting electric field strengths\nto be determined.\nSpecific launch times will be determined after the ship\narrives on site from a daily analysis of magnetometer data\nand ionosonde data. It is also expected that real time data\nfrom other locations will be available on occasion and they\nwill also be used in the decision-making process as available.\n-more-\n\n-7-\n\nThe solar forecast center at Boulder will make data\nfrom its worldwide net of observation stations available\nin real time and will provide forecasts for the geomagnetic\nactivity.\nThe scientific literature records a flux dependence\non level of disturbance of the Earth\'s magnetic field resulting from solar flares. The forecast center will assist\nin selecting the period in June 1978 having the greatest\nlikelihood of an intense magnetic storm and make the magnetic data available for the scientists to use in selecting\nthe appropriate launch times.\nSummarizing\nEnergetic particles will be measured directly. However, since these measurements can be spurious if contaminated by ambient dense plasma, ultraviolet light, insufficient outgassing of detectors, high voltage, intermittent\nbreakdown or by the existence of large fluxes of particles\nat energies or charge not expected, different types of particle sensors having different susceptibilities to masking\nby supurious effects will be used. The atmospheric effects\nproduced by particles will also be measured with a variety\nof techniques in flight and from the ground.\nComparison Criteria\nA total of nine sounding rockets will be launched during\nJASPIC. Five of these will be the Soviet MR-12 rocket system,\neach equipped with a variety of instruments designed to measure the required parameters. The NASA portion of the total\nmeasurements scheme will be conducted using four sounding\nrocket systems, complemented by ground-based and airborne\nmeasurements.\nThe proposed sequence of launches and supporting\nrationale follows: One MR-12 system will be launched during\na quiet time to obtain background data for payload instruments and to provide a reference set of data. After sunset\non the day of a magnetic disturbance, a set of three rockets\nwill be launched approximately within a few minutes of one\nanother. This set will consist of one NASA TMA (trimethyl\naluminum) payload, and one Nike Apache diagnostic payload\nand one MR-12.\n\n-more-\n\n-8-\n\nAbout three hours later, a second group of launches\nis planned: one MR-12, a second NASA Nike Apache and the\nNASA Nike Tomahawk. The nightglow will be monitored from\nthe ground prior to the first set of launchings until after\nthe second set. These airglow measurements will be made\nfrom the ground at Wallops Island, from Arecibo, Puerto\nRico and from Huancayo, Peru, in order to obtain the lati- *\ntudinal variation in the airglow produced by the particle\nfluxes.\nAirborne measurements of airglow and of ionospheric\ndensity around the Wallops vicinity will also be made in\norder to ascertain the extent of local "patchiness" and\nprovide data in the event that clouds cover the ground\nobservation sites. The data from these sets of launches,\ntogether with the airborne and ground-based measurements,\ncomprise the prime data comparison set.\nIt should be noted that it is necessary to make measurements of particles during a moderate geomagnetic disturbance for verification of literature results since there\nis little,question that auroral type precipitation should\nbe seen at Wallops Center under extreme conditions when the\naurora is pushed far to the south. A very large event is\ncertainly useful for intercomparison. If there is reason\nto expect a "giant storm" event, the operation will be modified accordingly,\nThe final phase of this intercomparison is to monitor\nthe effects of the magnetic storm with time. This will be\neffected by use of the Soviet rockets remaining following\nthe flights during the disturbance. Of these two Soviet\ntime dependence flights, the exact time chosen will be determined on-site by the U.S.S.R. side and will depend upon results obtained on previous launches and will be coordinated\nwith U.S. satellite overflights if feasible, all within two\nor three days after the disturbance.\nThe decision regarding exact launch time will be made at\nthe site utilizing solar forecast center data on immiment solar\nand geomagnetic activity. For example, a new, large flare\nwould lead to a few days delay in launching one or more of the\nSoviet time dependence payloads in order to monitor the effect\nof the new magnetic storm near its peak.\nThe three MR-12 launches which are planned to occur outside the period of disturbance, together with satellite and\nground-based data, comprise an important comparison of Soviet\nin-situ measurements with U.S. ground-based measurements and\nare important to the understanding of the physics of the\nmagnetosphere-ionospheric interactions over time and latitude.\n-more-\n\n-9-\n\nPROJECT OFFICIALS\nNASA\nDr. Erwin R.
