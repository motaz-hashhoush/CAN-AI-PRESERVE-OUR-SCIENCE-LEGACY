b'Space Grant Research Launches Rehabilitation Chair\nNASA Technology\n\nA\n\nstay on the International Space Station is no\nvacation. During a visit to the orbiting National\nLaboratory, astronauts divide their time among\na variety of tasks. For one, they look after a multitude of\nspace-based science experiments. For another, they clean\nand check the station\xe2\x80\x99s equipment\xe2\x80\x94inside and out. They\nalso spend a significant amount of time doing something\nyou might not expect: exercising.\nIn microgravity, astronauts\xe2\x80\x99 bodies do not have to\nwork like they do on Earth to move and accomplish\nnormal daily tasks. Without the force of gravity acting\non their bodies every moment of the day, astronauts\xe2\x80\x99\nbones lose density in space at a rate 10 times faster than\nthose who suffer from osteoporosis. To stay healthy and\nkeep their bones strong, astronauts spend a considerable\namount of time working out while in orbit.\n\nTechnology Transfer\nIn 2000, a biomedical engineering student at\nMichigan Technological University, Jeff Leismer,\nbecame particularly interested in this issue of bone loss\nin microgravity. He was taking a class called Aerospace\nPhysiology and Bone Remodeling, taught by Dr.\nWilliam Harold Cooke.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe skeleton loses about 1 percent of bone mass per\nmonth in space,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cooke, now in the Department of\nHealth and Kinesiology at the University of Texas at San\nAntonio. \xe2\x80\x9cAt Michigan Tech, we had an idea to develop\nsomething to simulate impact to the body so the bone\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t decrease as much in space.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLeismer says he began looking closely at mechanical\nvibration as a possible solution. At the time, a study had\nfound that vibration could stimulate bone growth in animals. The researchers suggested that vibration fooled the\nbones into thinking they were working hard, resulting in\nthe retention and growth of bone.\n34\t\n\nHealth and Medicine\t\n\nJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Koichi\nWakata, Expedition 38 flight engineer, gets a workout on the\nadvanced Resistive Exercise Device in the Tranquility node of\nthe International Space Station. Intense exercise regimens are\na necessary part of life in microgravity to maintain bone and\nmuscle mass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow then, do we apply vibration to the weight-bearing components of the human body, which are the ones\nmost affected by bone disuse atrophy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Leismer.\nTo begin answering his question, Leismer began his\ngraduate thesis research, with Cooke serving as advisor.\nCooke had received funding from the Michigan Space\n\nGrant Consortium, part of the National Space Grant\nCollege and Fellowship Program, which was implemented\nby NASA in 1989 to fund research, education, and public\nservice projects through a network of university-based\nSpace Grant consortia.\nWorking with Space Grant funding under Cooke\xe2\x80\x99s\npurview, Leismer built a prototype vibration-based system\nthat could apply compressive loads from the heel to knee,\nheel to the waist, and heel to the shoulders to strengthen\nbone, just like a weight-bearing exercise would.\nWhen it came time to test the system, Leismer decided\nto try it out. After about 10 minutes on the device, he\nattempted to stand, but nearly fell down. \xe2\x80\x9cIt felt like I\ndid about 1,000 leg presses. I realized then that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\njust affecting bone; it was affecting muscle as well. That\nwas my \xe2\x80\x98Ah-ha\xe2\x80\x99 moment, and I knew I\xe2\x80\x99d better apply for\na patent,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technology was something much\nbigger than I\xe2\x80\x99d thought it was going to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFrom Michigan Tech, Leismer went to the University\nof Florida to work with other bone researchers and to\nmake sure his treatment device wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to create any\nsafety concerns. After completing his doctoral work, he\nreceived funding from the National Institutes of Health\nand, three years later, started selling the device.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe work under Cooke was the inspiration for this\nproduct,\xe2\x80\x9d says Leismer, now the founder and chief technology officer of Sheboygan, Wisconsin-based VibeTech.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI started this over 10 years ago, and now we are making\nit a commercial product.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBenefits\nNamed VibeTech One, Leismer\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation chair\nuses a biomimetic approach to therapy, meaning it uses\nhuman-made means to mimic something that happens\nnaturally. In this case, the chair uses vibration to simulate\nload-bearing exercise, which elicits muscle contractions in\nthe body. The body then responds in a manner similar\nto the way it would respond to weight-bearing physical\nactivity, and the bones and muscles are strengthened.\nSpinoff 2015\n\n\t\nExercise is the number-one thing you\nshould do, but patients don\xe2\x80\x99t do it because\nof barriers including exertion, pain, and\nflexibility. I am hoping this will help people\nlead a much higher quality of life\xe2\x80\x94and\nhopefully live longer as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Jeff Leismer, VibeTech\nAccording to the company, the treatment has two\nparts: partial bodyweight loading and muscle vibration.\nThe adjustable partial bodyweight loading simulates\nforces acting on the legs during standing and walking\nwhile also preparing the legs for the muscle vibration,\nwhich is recommended for up to 10 minutes at a time,\nthree to five times a week.\nOne of the main advantages of the VibeTech One is\nthat it does not require any physical exertion. As a rehabilitation chair, it can be used by people who have little or\nno physical strength or function from their heels to their\nlower back. They can simply sit and relax as the therapy\ntakes place.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are providing treatment to put the mechanical\nsignals into the body that it needs to stay strong\xe2\x80\x94even\nduring a period of inactivity. It\xe2\x80\x99s for anyone suffering\nfrom disuse atrophy and functional decline due to age,\ndisability, illness, injury, or surgery,\xe2\x80\x9d says Leismer. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a\nrehabilitation environment, our goal is to get people up\nand out of wheelchairs and walking independently.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAfter a patient becomes strong enough, a setting on\nthe device can be adjusted to require more effort from the\npatient. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can choose anywhere from 0 to 100 percent\neffort from the user. They can do leg presses against the\nmachine if they want, or the device itself can provide all\nof the work,\xe2\x80\x9d says Leismer.\nThe first commercial application of the technology\nwill be in the rehabilitation department of a skilled\nnursing facility. Another place where the product will\nlikely find beneficial applications, however, is sports\nSpinoff 2015\t\n\nmedicine, where the chair can be used to reduce muscle\natrophy while keeping the joints limber after an injury\nor surgery. Already, a prototype in a hospital has shown\nsuccess in treating patients with ankle sprains, hamstring\nsprains, and pelvic fractures. Anecdotal evidence reports\nthat the technology has provided the added benefit of\nreducing pain for these patients as well.\nCurrently designed for the lower extremities, the\ndevice could potentially be used on any part of the body,\nexplains Leismer. \xe2\x80\x9cOur treatment provides dynamic\nmotion in a form that replicates natural biomechanical\n\nsignaling in the body. Although we haven\xe2\x80\x99t tested all\nof these areas yet, we fully anticipate that they will be\npositively influenced by treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWith high hopes for the future, Leismer suggests the\ntechnology could be a new solution for getting people to\nexercise. \xe2\x80\x9cExercise is the number-one thing you should\ndo, but patients don\xe2\x80\x99t do it because of barriers including\nexertion, pain, and flexibility,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI am hoping this\nwill help people lead a much higher quality of life\xe2\x80\x94and\nhopefully live longer as well.\xe2\x80\x9d v\n\nThe VibeTech One rehabilitation chair can be used by people who have little or no physical strength or function in their lower body.\nUsers can sit and relax as the therapy progresses.\n\nHealth and Medicine \t 35\n\n'
