The Department of Energy (DOE), NASA, and academic and private-sector scientists are collaborating to build a\nrobot called Pioneer a four-foot-tall, half-ton cross\nbetween a tractor and a tank. Pioneer will inspect the\ninterior of the reactor capturing hundreds of images\nthat will be used to build a "virtual world" of the\ndamaged reactor.

Impact forces are transmitted through actual\ncontact between the teeth during gear acceleration.\n\nIn traditional linear static stress analysis, you begin by\nbuilding an FEA model. Then you set up boundary\nconditions to anchor the model in three-dimensional\nspace.\nIf the boundary conditions fail to stop the model from\nmoving in all six primary directions (three degrees of\nfreedom in translation and three in rotation), the static\nFEA process cannot work. After setting up the boundary conditions, you then apply the moment (M) or\ntorque, which could be generated by an electric motor,\nand an assumed force (F) or pressure to simulate the\nreaction of the second gear. After analysis you will\nhave a stress contour for one point in time.\nBecause the gear teeth are constantly clashing in a\nrandom way, the impact forces cannot be known with\nany precision.\n\nNew\n\nWhen the analysis runs, you will\nknow it\'s set up\nproperly when\nyou see the gears\naccelerating and\nstresses changing\nas you view the\nlive on-screen\n"monitor pro-\t\n\nPlot of acceleration vs. time shows\n\nhigh-frequency impacts.\ngram."\t\nAt the end, you see the stresses on all the gear teeth\nat every point in time.\nAnd, you can make an analysis replay to see the\nresults in real time or slow motion. In addition, you\ncan run a Fast Fourier Transform on the displacement\ndata to highlight any dangers from resonance.\n\nIn Algor\'s Mechanical Event\nSimulation, you begin the same\nway by building an FEA model.\nHowever, this time you include the\nsecond gear.\nYou place boundary conditions at\nthe pivots. The big gear is free to\nrotate when forced by the driving\ngear.

In the late 1960s, an agricultural engineering student at Colorado\nState University came up with what\n\nmight be called a "percolator pump" to\ntransfer insecticides and other fluids which might be either toxic or corrosive\n- from a 55-gallon drum.\nBasically, it consists of a fairly small\n(perhaps 314" ID) plastic tube which is\nplaced vertically in the barrel with a\n\nsmaller air hose supplying a simple bubbler at the base of the tube. As the air\nrises through the tube, it carries with it\na surprising amount of fluid. The top of\nthe tube has a U-bend through which\nthe fluid exits into a collector leading to\na hose (gravity feed to the implement\ntank) and the air is vented.\nI don\'t know if such a device will work\nfor Mr. Horkheimer\'s application. If venting the air to the atmosphere presents\na problem, it would not be difficult to\ndesign a closed air recirculating system\nwhich would have the additional benefit\nof being able to work at an elevated system pressure.\nStephen Robert Snook\nChief Engineer\nSystems Research Services\nPort Hueneme, CA\n\nWeighing as little is\n0.08 grams, rugged\nEndevco sensors excel in\n\nThe lightweight, high-performance\nthermal insulation developed for the\nspace shuttle and described in NASA\nTech Briefs has a direct application as a\nheat barrier around the hot sections of\njet engines.

Stoltzfus\nand Subhasish Sircar,\nJohnson Space Center\n\nMetal oxide powders are used in chemical laboratories and in manufacturing\nprocesses, but existing methods for producing them involve multistep processes\nrequiring elaborate apparatus that are\nrelatively time-consuming, cumbersome,\nand expensive. The present invention\nprovides a technique for producing large\namounts of oxide powders utilizing combustion with a minimal number of\nprocess steps. A material, which may be a\nmetal or metal alloy, is provided in the\nform of a rod and put in a combustion\nchamber housing. An igniter is applied\nto it, and it is then exposed to an oxygen\natmosphere, or an atmosphere enriched\nwith oxygen. The igniter causes combustion of the material to produce powdered\noxide. In one embodiment of the invention a feeder is provided so that the material can be advanced into the combustion\nchamber continuously via rollers, moving\nthrough a seal so that the chamber\'s ability to contain the combustion reaction is\npreserved.\n\nConnect powerful\nnumerical analysis\nand interactive data\nvisualization to your\nother software tools\nusing HiQ 4.0\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Embed interactive H1Q 3D\ngraphs in Microsoft Word\nor PowerPoint\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Drag-and-drop Excel data\ninto HIQ for easy analysis\nand visualization\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Automate the power of HiQ\nanalysis from other\napplications using ActiveX\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Leverage your existing\n\nEncyclopedia of\nSoftware Components\n(U.S. Patent No. 5,632,022)\n\nMATLAB programs\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Connect to real-time\n\nAke\nfor\n\ndata acquisition\n\nInventors: Lloyd V.

The security system consists\nof a light source, a receptacle, a key, and\na decoder. The source provides light\nalong a predetermined path. The receptacle has a passageway with entrance and\nexit portions located to intercept the\nlight. The key consists of a carrier and a\nfiber optic, which is located in the carrier to intercept the light at the exit portion of the passageway. This fiber optic\nhas one or more Bragg gratings that\nreflect the intercepted light into a predetermined spectral pattern. The decoder\nhas means for receiving and decoding\nthe pattern, by comparing it with a preselected pattern and generating an electrical signal when the two match. The signal operates the lock or lights a display of\nan authentication panel.\n\nFor more information on the inventions described here, contact the appropriate NASA Field \r\nCenter\'s Commercial Technology Office.

The spacecraft was essentially an enormous balloon, its diameter roughl y equivalent to\nthe height of a 10-story building. NASA needed a high!\', reflective material for Echos skin so that it could bounce back radio\nsignals. And, because Echo inflated univ when ii i umlwd (it bit-in altitude it had to\naltitude,\nbe lightweight and\nthin enough to travel\ninside a beach-ballsized canister.\nNASA selected it\nMylar polyester coated\nwith a reflective layer of\naluminum particles so\nfine that Echo\'s skin\nwas half the thickness of\nthe cellophane wrapper\non a cigarette pack.\nThis process of metallization - treating materials with a superfine\nmist of vacuum-vaporized metal to create it An employee inspects vacuum-metallized\nfoil-like effect - origi- plastic film.\nnated in the 19th century. But the technology developed sloNvIN y the late 1950s, metallized plastics were being produced primarily for decorative pur-B\nposes, but the demand was small.\nNASA\'s requirements helped build metallization into a flourishing industry, prompting extensive research and development\nof metallization techniques for applications such as thermal radiation insulation. Metallizecl film has been used on virtually every\nU.S. spacecraft since the early 1960s.\nThe Metallized Products Division of King-Seeley Thermos\n(KST), Winchester, MA, helped commercialize the NASA-sponsored technology. KST further developed the technology ofvacuum-metallizing plastic films, expanding the process to include\ngold, silver, copper, and zinc. Metallized materials have a variety\nof commercial applications, including outdoor clothing, foodpackaging materials, wall coverings, aircraft covers, and reflective\nblankets. While the technology existed before NASA\'s use of it,\nspace use led to greater commercial applicability\n\nThe Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO), developed b y NASA\nin the early 1960s, was a solar-astronom y spacecraft. NASA\'s contractor for the satellite - Ball Aerospace S ystems Division of\nBoulder, CO - found that conventional lubricating materials\nwould be unsuitable for long-term exposure to the vacuum of\n24\t\n\nspace. To meet NASA\'s requirements, Ball developed a new family of dry lubricants specifically formulated for long life in space.\nResearchers also devised processes for appl ying the lubricants to\nspacecraft components in microscopicall y thin coatings.\nThe dry lubricants worked successfully on seven OSO flights,\nand Ball scientists began exploring possible non-aerospace applications. The compan y developed hundreds of variations on the\noriginal OSO technolog-v, improving the quality and efficienc y of\na wide range of commercial products and industrial processes.\nApplications include solar-energy collection s ystems, protective\ncoatings for motion-picture film, preservative coating to protect\nthe sound fidelity of phonograph records, lubricants designed to\nwithstand "cold room" conditions in the meat-packing industrt\nand treating electric motor and generator brushes to reduce\nbrush icar.\n\nJILOS\nHIW iorces\nIn 1837, a blacksmith named John Deere perfected the steel\nplow. The company he founded to manufacture and sell farming\nequipment has grown into one of the world\'s largest manufacturing businesses - Deere & Compan y, based in Moline, IL.\nDeere now employs 35,500 people worldwide and manufactures\nhundreds of products, including agricultural tractors, harvesters,\nindustrial and construction equipment, and lawn-and-garden\ntractors.

It is an excellent thermal\nconductor and electrical insulator. The mineral is transparent\nnot only to visible light, but also to infrared and ultraviolet. Were\nit not for their high cost, diamonds would be the ideal material\nfor a wide range of industrial applications. But advances in materials technology offer a lower-cost alternative by coating and\nchemically bonding an inexpensive substrate with a thin film of\ndiamond-like carbon (DLC).\nDiamond films have great potential as chemically inert protective coatings that make machine tools and parts last ten\ntimes longer. Other applications include optical instruments,\nmedical equipment, watch crystals, and eyeglasses. Among the\nAmerican companies involved in DLC commercialization is\nDiamonex, a spinoff company of Air Products and Chemicals\nof Allentown, PA, which is using, tinder exclusive license,\nNASA technology for depositing DLCs on a substrate.\nFor more than a decade, NASA\'s Lewis Research Center has\n26\t\n\ninvestigated the\naerospace potential\nof synthetic di\nmond coating,\nLewis developed\nmethod called (l\nrect ion-beam dep\nsition for applyinl\nDLCs to a substrate.

This low-pressure, low-temperature process\nallows use of plastics and other substrates that cannot withstand the high pressures and temperatures normall y used to\nsynthesize diamonds.\nDiamonex has received assistance from Lewis in developing\nscratch-resistant coatings for plastic prescription eyeglasses.\nOther commercial DLC applications include coatings for magnetic data-storage discs, surgical needles, and a diamond-coated\nball for an artificial hip joint.\n\nLong-Term Protection\nThe location of NASA\'s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on\nFlorida\'s Atlantic Coast exposes the launch facilit y\'s steel structures to a corrosive onslaught of salt spray and fog. NASA\nrequired a protective coating that would reduce maintenance\ncost for the gantries - steel frameworks that pro vide multi-level\naccess to launch vehicles and other KSC facilities.\nResearchers at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center improved \r\non existing water-based zinc silicate coatings by boosting the ratio \r\nof potassium to silicate The resulting breakthrough in inorganic \r\nchemistry provided KSC\r\nwith an easy-to-use, zincitch coating that provided\r\nlong-term protection with\r\nnile application. In 1981,\r\nNASA granted a license\r\nfor the coating process to\r\nShane Associates of\r\nWynnewood, PA. The following year, Inorganic\r\nCoatings (IC) of Malvern,\r\nRA became sole manufacturer and sales agent\r\nunder the Shane license.\r\nIC now markets the product under the name IC\n531 . O ver several years of\nThe Interior structure of Hong Kong\'s Po\t\ncommercial use, IC 531\nLin Buddha was coated with IC 531, \t\noriginally developed by NASA.\t\nhas shown exceptional\nperformance in singlecoat applications and as a primer in multi-coat systems. This\nwater-based coating is non-toxic, non-flammable, and generates no hazardous wastes. IC estimates that the coating will protect steel structures for "well be yond 25 years." It has been used\non a variety of outdoor structures, military vehicles, dock\nequipment, power stations, bridges, and tractor-trailer frames.\nIn 1984, IC 531 was selected by the National Park Service and\nthe Statue of Liberty Foundation as the best coating for protecting Miss Liberty well into the 21st centur y. More recently, it\nwas applied to the interior framework of Hong Kong\'s enormous Po Lin Buddha.\n\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nNASA Tech Briefs,June 1998\n\nELISHA GRAY,\nINVENTOR OF THE TELEPHONE.\n\nPOOR ELISHA GRAY.\nFILED FOR A PATENT ON HIS TELEPHONE PROTOTYPE JUST \r\nTHREE HOURS AFTER ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL FILED FOR HIS.\n\nTHERE\'S NO AWARD FOR SECOND PLACE.\n\nFINISH FIRST!\nIMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND GET YOUR PRODUCT TO \r\nMARKET FASTER FOR LESS MONEY WITH HP AND ANSYS.\nINTRODUCING THE\r\n\nHP/ANSYS HARDWARE/ SOFTWARE BUNDLE.\n\n00*40 ,000\xc2\xb00\nA fully optimized engineering solution at an unbeatable price.*\n\nAWSYS/Mechanical\xc2\xb0 M Software:\nThe most widely used design\nanalysis tool in the world, capable of solving diverse\nanalyses, including\n-\n\n-\n\nlinear and nonlinear\nstructural, steady-state and\ntransient thermal, and coupled-\n\nHPC200 Technical Workstation Specifications:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Base system with 200MHz PA-RISC 8200 CPU\n\xe2\x80\xa2 512MB High-Density ECC Memory\n\xe2\x80\xa2 9GB Ultra SCSI Internal Hard Disk Drive\n\xe2\x80\xa2 12x CD-ROM Internal Disk Drive\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Color Quartz Monitor, 1280 x 1024 resolution\nVISUALIZE-FX2 3D Solid Graphics Accelerator. 24-bit frame\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nbuffer with 8 overlay planes.\n\nfield analysis.

HITEC now provides strain-gage\nservices in creating transducers out of such components as Indy\nracing-car suspension pushrods, NASCAR suspension components, and components used in motion control. HITEC generally supplies sensors to measure strain, stress, and loads on automotive, gas turbine, and structural components. The first U.S.made bobsled for the U.S. Bobsled Team also has benefited from\nthe company \'s technology - HITEC installed sensors on the\nfour skate runner shoes to measure vibration forces.\n\n4\t\n\nSurviving the Shakes\nAlong with 400,000 pounds of thrust, each of the Space\nShuttle\'s three main engines generates enough vibration to\nshake itself to pieces. In developing the engines, NASA required\nfasteners that could withstand the shock and vibration without\nloosening. This was a tall order, hut NASA wanted even more:\nThe fastener had to have a 15-cycle reuse capability.\nSpiralock Corporation of Madison Heights, MI, exceeded\nNASA\'s requirements with the Spiralock internal-thread fastener. NASA tests indicated that this "super fastener" held tight even\nwhen subjected to vibration ten times greater than the shuttle\nrequirement. And Spiralock maintained its clamping power after\n50 cycles. Every shuttle engine built incorporates more than 750\nSpiralock fasteners.\nSpiralock\'s key component is a 30-degree wedge ramp. When\nclamp load is applied during assembly, the Spiralock thread form\nlocks the standard male fastener in place by drawing the crests of\nthe male thread tightly against the wedge lamp. This wedge-locking makes Spiralock exceptionally resistant to transverse vibration - the major cause of thread loosening - and substantially\nreduces the risk of fatigue failure.\n\nA 111gb Adventure\nMount Spurr - an active volcano in Alaska - erupted three\ntimes in 1992.

The pseudo16385.185-Hz signal is used in conjunction with counters to generate the 32-Hz\nsignal with high resolution in the following way: A 37-bit counter toggles the\nupper 32 bits of spacecraft time, giving\nresolution of 1/32 s. Another counter of\n9 bits toggles a 14-bit subsecond time\nword.\nThe bus arbiter is the only unrelated\nblock inside the RSDL ASIC. It contains\ncircuitry to arbitrate the ISB between\nfour possible bus masters.\nThe ISB I/F contains the logic circuitry that serves as an interface between the\nRSDL ASIC and an external bus arbiter\nor an engineering flight computer via\nthe ISB. Software that resides in\nan external computer reads from and\n\nwrites to internal registers in the ASIC\nvia the ISB I/F. This block indicates\nwhether data are stable and whether\ndata written by the ASIC are captured\ncorrectly.\nNotable features of the RSDL ASIC\n(in addition to those mentioned above)\ninclude the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It provides a spacecraft clock to keep\ntrack of time from 0 to 136 years in\n61.03-ms intervals;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There is a correlation between spacecraft time and the first bit of a defined\ntransfer frame;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It is easy to reconfigure the RSDL\nASIC to other applications: The\nlength of the transfer frame is programmable, software defines the time\nof the resynchronization of the transfer frames, and the RS encoder can be\nturned on and off; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Software that resides in the flight\ncomputer can read and write status\nand interrupt signals generated by the\nRSDL ASIC.\nThis work was done by James A.

When the\nPROMEDAC finds an uncorrectable\nerror. it gives notice to that effect by\nsending out a "bad" parity signal on the\ndata-bus portion of the ISB.\nThe FDU includes a watchdog timer\nand provides interrupt-control support,\nreset control, and eight discrete outputs\nthat facilitate the exchange of information on the integrity and operational\ncondition of the system.\nThe ASIC receives a serial, digital\ndata stream as well as a clock signal and\na "lock" signal from the uplink data\nreceiver. Two parallel-processing algorithms are used in the HCD block,\nwhere traditionally a serial process has\nbeen used. "Start" detection is performed by checking the 32 most recent\nbits of data with the acquisition\nsequence followed by the "start" sequence. EDAC is also performed by\nusing Perlrnan\'s (1980) serial algorithm\nin a parallel process. A search of uplink\ndata is performed, depending on the\n"active" or "inactive" state of the I-lCD.\nWhenever the "lock" signal is not present, the ASIC goes into the "inactive"\nstate and ignores the uplink. When the\n"lock" signal appears, the ASIC goes\ninto the "search" state and starts searching uplink data for the "start" sequence.\nIt then goes into the "decode" state and\nstarts decoding code blocks.\nEDAC is performed on each code\nblock, and the code block is placed in a\ndata buffer accessible via software. A\n"tail" sequence forces the ASIC hack\ninto the "search" state. Software must\nfetch a code block from the data buffers\n(described below) and perform the format checks and interpretation of data,\nThe ASIC presents code blocks to software that pieces them together to form\nlarger frames.\nThe ASIC contains two data buffers\nthat are used to pass each uplink code\nblock to the software. Each buffer consists of four 16-bit registers and can hold\none 64-hit code block. These two data\nbuffers enable the software to rc:ul wic\nbuffer while the hardware lou I ii\nother buffer.\nThe CRC block communicate\' di c\nIv with the HCD block.

The CRC\nblock includes an EFC/CRC interface\nthat comprises three registers that store\n24 volatile CRC hits. These bits are readable and writable through the ISB. An\nHCD/CRC interface also provides\nNASA-lo-di Iriets.uiie 1998\n\nnonvolatile control of relays. Relay state\nmay be changed ahead through the ISB.\nThe ISB interface connects the ASIC\nto the outside world through the ISB\nbus.

Because of\ntheir superior mechanical properties,\nthese composites have been replacing\nmetals, such as aluminum alloys, in\nmany applications. The replacement of\nmetals has been slow, however, when\nhigh electrical conductivity is needed\nbecause of the relatively poor electrical\nconductivity (< 0.1 percent of metals)\nof composite materials. Designers have\nalso shied away from graphite-polymer\ncomposites in applications where\nshielding from ionizing radiation is\nimportant, because of the poor performance of these composites.\n\nThese shortcomings of graphite-fiber\npolymer composites can be addressed\nby intercalating the fibers before fabricating the composites. Intercalation is\nthe insertion of guest atoms or molecules (intercalates) in between the carbon layers of the fibers. If the intercalate is chosen carefully, the electrical\nconductivity of the composite can be\nincreased nearly an order of magnitude, and the specific radiation shielding can surpass low density metals.\nTwo intercalates, bromine and\niodine monobromide, have been\nshown to have the right combination of\nproperties to make them commercially\nviable options. They combine the\nvirtues of high electrical conductivity,\nhigh thermal conductivity, and good\n\nPr\n\nradiation shielding with excellent stability and easy processibility.\nBromine has been shown to intercalate a wide variety of pitch-based and\nvapor-grown graphite fibers. Most of\nthe research has centered around\nAmoco\'s Thornal fibers. Bromine has\nbeen shown to enhance the conductivity of P-55, P-75, P0-100, P-120, and K1100 fibers by a factor of three to six.\nThe resulting material has an electrical\nconductivity surpassing that of stainless\nsteel. Furthermore, these intercalation\ncompounds are stable to temperature\nwell above the processing temperature\nfor most resins, and are impervious to\nmoisture and ultra-high vacuum.\nFabrication of composites from intercalated fibers does not degrade their\n\nSPS6000 is the ideal analog front end for your\nPC-based data acquisition.

Although intercalation\ndoes not enhance either the mechanical properties or the thermal conductivity of graphite fiber composites, neither does it degrade them. The\nmechanical properties are virtually\nidentical with those of pristine fibers,\nexcept that there is an enhancement in\nthe interlamirxar shear properties. The\nthermal conductivities of these fibers\nare among the highest of all materials,\nexceeding such metals as aluminum\nand copper. Also, because of the high\nthermal absorption and emissivity of\ngraphite fibers, radiant heat is rejected\nmuch more efficiently from electrical\ncomponents than when they are\nencased in highly reflective metals. The\nmass absorption coefficient for ionizing radiation by composites made from\nintercalated fibers is enhanced by a factor of four, to a value exceeding that\nof aluminum.\nIodine monobromide has not been\nstudied as extensivel y as bromine has as\nan intercalate for graphite fibers.\nThose studies that have been done\nreveal intercalation compounds nearly\nidentical with those utilizing bromine.\nThe exception is in the mass absorption coefficient for ionizing radiation,\nwhich is nearly twice that of bromine\nintercalation compounds, and three\ntimes that of aluminum. The implication is that iodine monobromide intercalated fiber composites can provide\nradiation shielding equal to that of aluminum with one-third the mass.\nThe primary application envisioned\nfor this technology is electromagnetic\ninterference (EM!) shielding of electronics. Calculations indicate that the\nshielding effectiveness of these composites, while not as high as that of aluminum, is higher than the requirements for many applications, and higher than that of joints and penetrations\nthrough metallic boxes. Experimental\nstudies confirm the high shielding\neffectiveness calculations. The surface\nconductivity, while not as high as that\nof metals, is high enough that no special surface treatments (sanding off the\nsurface poly mer layer, etc.) are\nrequired. These materials can be used\neffectively with conventional EM!\nshielding gasketing strategies.\nThe total achievable mass savings\ndepends on the particular requirements of the shield. If the limiting factor is shielding from high-energy radiation, a mass savings of 66 percent is\nachievable. If the limit is strength, 86\npercent of the mass can be saved.\nFinally, if the limit is stiffness (moduNASA Tech Briefs.

Typical installations in\nwhich the instruments could prove beneficial include outdoor sensing equipment, computer rooms, broadcasting stations, and powerplant-control rooms.\nThe present instrument (see figure) includes three orthogonal antennas on an electrically conductive sphere. Each\nantenna senses one of the three orthogonal components of the\ntransient electric field. The current i(t) induced in each antenna is proportional to the rate of change of the electric-field\ncomponent E(t), and is given by\ni(t)= kAE dE\ndt\nwhere I is time, A is the area of the antenna, e is the permittivity of air (very close to \xc2\xa30, the permittivity of the vacuum), and\nk is a constant that expresses the concentration of the electric\nfield in the vicinity of the antenna or a similar electrically conductive object. The spherical shape was chosen because k for a\nsphere is easily determined and is found to equal 3.\nIn the instrument, the currents are measured to determine\nthe rates of change of the components of the electric field. The\ncurrent signals are also integrated to obtain signals proportional to the electric-field components.\nThe instrument includes a microprocessor that controls its\noverall operation. It also includes an analog-to-digital converter and a sampling clock. Under control by the microprocessor,\nthe analog-to-digital converter samples the waveform of one\ncomponent of the electric field at a rate of 10 MHz for a duration of 50 ps. (The reason for not sampling all three waveform\ncomponents is simply that doing so would consume too much\npower.) Also under control by the microprocessor, the peak\nvalues of all three components of the electric field and their\ntime derivatives are sampled and compared with specified\nthreshold levels during intervals of 1 ms. The electric-field\nwaveform sample values and their times are stored in a nonvolatile random-access memory (NVRAM). The peak electricfield and derivative sample values that exceed the threshold\nlevels, and their times, are also stored in the NYRAM.\nThe stored values are subsequently read out by use of a\nportable computer. The instrument is powered by batteries\nand can operate unattended for as long as two weeks. The\ninclusion of the NVRAM prevents the loss of data in the event\nof a power failure. The batteries can be changed in the field,\nso that the instrument can remain in place and continue to\nmeasure the electric field without interruption.\nWith their 10-MHz sampling rate, both this instrument and\nthe previously reported magnetic-field instrument measure\nelectromagnetic fields generated by lightning more accurately\nthan do portable commercial magnetic-field meters. Lightning\nwaveforms typically include frequencies up to tens of megahertz, while the commercial meters, which are designed to\nmeasure magnetic fields of high-voltage power lines, are usually limited in frequency response to a few hundred hertz.\nThis work was done by Pedro J.

The coarse estimate is not\nsuitable for fine-attitude applications\nlike aiming a telescope or a laser\nbeam, but it can be used, for example,\nto guide the orientation of a broadbeam communication antenna, to aim\na solar panel, or to initialize a fine attitude-determination algorithm or instrument.\nThe technique is most easily practiced in the case of an antenna with a\nbroad radiation pattern in which the\ngain decreases monotonically with\nincreasing angle off boresight. The\nGPS receiver used in this technique\nmust be one that generates data on the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal received from each GPS satellite\nthat it tracks. Once the GPS receiver\nhas computed its position from the\nreceived GPS signals, the direction to\neach tracked UPS satellite is known as\na byproduct.\nThe SNR of the signal received from\neach tracked GPS satellite is taken as a\ncrude measure of the relative strength\nof the signal and, as such, is used as a\nweighting value to obtain a vector sum:\nThe unit vector in the known direction\nto each tracked satellite is multiplied\nby the SNR for that satellite. The sum\nof such scalar-vector products for all\nthe tracked satellites is a vector, the\ndirection of which is taken to be the\nestimated antenna boresight direction.\nThe length of the vector also constitutes ancillary information about the\ngeometric properties of the constellation of tracked GPS satellites.\nIf only one UPS satellite is being\ntracked, then the estimated boresight\npoints directly at that satellite; such an\nestimate is usually erroneous, but it\ncould be helpful in finding other satellites to track and thus obtain a better\nestimate. When six to eight UPS satellites are being tracked, the estimated\nboresight differs from the actual boresight by no more than about 15\xc2\xb0.\nThis work was (lone by Charles Dunn\nand Courtney Duncan of Caliech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, access the Technical Support Package (TSP) free on-line\nat www.nasatech.com under the Electronic\nSystems category, or circle no. 107 on the\nTSP Order Card in this issue to receive a\ncopy by mail ($5 charge).\nNPO-20323\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1998\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 POWER BATT\t\n\nSON\'Y\n1JVQU IWJ\n\nA\n\n-\t\n\nIntelligent\nTape\n\nWHEN IT COMES \'Fa\nCRITICAL RECORDING,\nWE\'RE INSTRUMENTAL\n\n95\n\nQuality is easy to detect.

A typical coating material\nis mullite (Al 6 Si9O 1 ), which can protect\nsilicon-based substrates against water-free\noxidizing and corrosive environments.\nMullite can also be applied as interinediate coating layers to relax stresses and\nenhance the adhesion of overlying protective layers of zirconia (Zr0 2 ) or nonstoichiometric anorthite (stoichiometric\ncomposition CaAl2Si2 0 5 ). The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of\nmullite and of some other typical oxide\ncoating materials are greater than the\nCTEs of silicon-based substrates and, as\na result, the coatings tend to crack\nthrough their thicknesses. The cracks\nbecome pathways for the entry of the\nchemical species from which one seeks\nto protect the substrates.\nIn one proposed technique, one or\nmore lower-GTE phase(s) would be\nincorporated into a mullite coating to\nreduce the GTE of the coating for a\nbetter GTE match with the substrate.\nSuitable lower-GTE compounds include\ncordierite (2MgO.2Al 2O5 .5SiO2 ) and\nfused silica (see Figure 1). Mullite,\ncordierite, and fused silica would be\nchemically compatible with the substrate,\nwith each other, and with typical other\noxide coating materials. A composite\ncoating of rnullite with cordierite and/or\nfused silica could be applied by plasma\nspraying or by a wet chemical process.\nThe GTE of a polycrystalline material\nlike a mullite/cordierite/fused silica\ncomposite can be approximated by a\nrule of mixtures: a, = a, V,, where a, is\nthe GTE of the composite, a, is the GTE\nof the ith constituent, and V, is the volume fraction of the ith constituent.\nInitially, the proportions of cordierite\nand/or fused silica could be chosen to\n66\t\n\nobtain a desired value of a according\nto this rule. However, because of the\ncomplexity of the phase composition of\nthe mullite/cordierite/fused silica system, a process of trial and error would\nlikely be necessary to establish the optimum composition.\n1.0\n\nIn the second proposed technique,\nzircon (ZrSiO4 ) would be applied as an\nintermediate layer between a substrate\nand an overlying protective coating.\nOptionally, if a dense, crack-free zircon\ncoating could be produced, then it could\nhe used, instead of mullite, as a protec-\n\n1111\nMullite\n\nsic\n\nca\n\nSi\n\nCD\nCL\n\nCD\t\n\n0\n\n400\t\n\n600\t\n\n800\t\n\n1,000\t\n\n1,200\t\n\n1,400\t\n\n1,600\t\n\n1,800\t\n\n2,000\n\nTemperature, Kelvins\nMullite\n\nCL\n\nFused Silica\n\n400\t\n\n600\t\n\n800\t\n\n1,000\t\n\n1,200\t\n\n1,400\t\n\n1,600\t\n\n1,800\t\n\n2,000\n\nTemperature, Kelvins\nFigure 1.

Thus far, the\nMFUD has been developed for trusses,\nwith cross-sectional areas of truss members as design variables. Like nonlinear\noptimization methods, the MFUD\nmethod is iterative, but in comparison\nwith those methods, the MFUD method\ninvolves less and simpler computation.\nThe MFUD method is derived from\nthe fully stressed design (FSD) and\nfully utilized design (FUD) methods.\nThe FSD method, based on a simple\nstress-ratio approach, is popular in\ncivil, mechanical, and aerospace engineering. The FSD method is an elegant\nconceptual tool for arriving at stresslimited designs, but does not provide\nfor displacement constraints, which are\nimposed with increasing frequency in\ndesigning modern structures.\n\nAn extension of the FSD method\nthrough provision for displacement\nconstraints in addition to stress constraints yields the FUD method. The\nterm "full y utilized design" signifies a\ndesign in which the number of active\nconstraints equals or exceeds the number of design variables. One obtains\nthe FUD of a structure by the following\nprocedure:\n1. Using the stress constraints only,\ngenerate the FSD.\n2. Uniformly prorate the FSD to obtain\nthe FUD, using a constant proration\nfactor that satisfies the single most\ninfeasible displacement constraint.\nFor a truss structure, this entails multiplying the cross-sectional areas of\nall truss members by the same factor\nto strengthen all the members\nenough to limit the displacement, as\nrequired.\nThe FUD thus obtained is feasible but\ncan be an overdesign; the weight of the\nFUD structure can be greater than that\nof an optimally designed structure.\n\nThe MFUD method accommodates\nboth stress and displacement constraints simultaneously. The steps of\nthis method applied to a simple truss\nstructure are the following:\n1. Identify the design variables to initiate iterations. Optionally, one can\nbegin iterations from the FSD. For\nsubsequent iterations, the stress constraints are expressed in terms of\ncross-sectional areas, given by\nA, = (F,) ,,,ax/iO,\n\nwhere Ai is the area in question for\nthe ith member, (F,). _ is the maximum force in ith member under all\nloading conditions, and cy o is the\nmaximum allowable stress in the ith\nmember.\n2. Identify the displacement constraints violated by the design\nobtained in step 1.\n3. For each displacement constraint\nidentified in step 2, update the\ndesign independently to satisfy the\nconstraint. The update process comprises two subprocesses: (1) identifi-\n\n,\n\nYou push the limits...\nMetrum-Datatape is the leader in\nrecording, reproducing and storage\n\nI\n\nproducts and systems.

The\nequations used in these subprocesses\nare derived from the integrated\nforce method, which was described\nin "Constructing Finite Elements for\nthe Integrated Force Method" (LEW16421), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 21,No.\n7 (July 1997), page 70.\n4. Obtain the design update for the structure as the union of all of the designs\nupdated for the constraints in step 3. If\nany member is affected by more than\none of the constraint-updated designs\nin the union process, the cross-sectional area selected for that member\nshould be the maximum one.\n5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until the\ndesign converges. The converged\ndesign will satisfy both stress and displacement constraints.\nFor More Information Circle No. 430\n\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nDespite its relative simplicity, and\neven though it does not incorporate an\nexplicit minimum-weight condition,\nthe MFUD method can yield solutions\ncomparable to those obtained b y nonlinear optimization techniques (for\nexample, see figure). Even if one still\nprefers a full optimization, the MFUD\nmethod could be used to generate initial designs for subsequent optimization iterations, thereby alleviating\nsome of the computational burden of\noptimization.\nThis work was done b\' Laszlo Berke and\nDale Hopkins of Lewis Research Center,\nSurya Patnaik of Ohio Aerospace Institute,\nand Atef Gendy of the National Research\nCouncil.

These devices\ncould be designed, for example, as color\nhigh-definition television displays, as\nlarger flat-panel displays for indoor and\noutdoor entertainment and advertising,\nas filter arrays for spectroscopy, and as\nmodulator arrays for optical computing\nand switching. In comparison with stateof-the-art flat-panel display devices based\non liquid crystals, plasmas, and electroluminescence, the present devices offer\npotential advantages of high speed,\ninsensitivity to changes in temperature,\nlow power consumption, wide viewing\nangle, scalability, light weight, and\nlong life.\nA related concept of using two-stage,\nmicromachined, electrostatically adjustable Fal)ry-Perot interferometers as\nrapidly tunable color filters and shutters was presented in "Micromachined\nOpto / Electro /Mechanical Systems"\n(NPO-19467), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 21,\nNo. 3 (March 1997), page 50, and\n"Micromachined Tunable Optical Interference Filters" (NPO-19456), NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 21, No. 3 (March 1997),\npage 111. The devices being developed\naccording to the present concept are\nbased on the same physical principles\nbut differ in significant details of design\nand modes of operation.\nIn a three-color television display\ndevice according to the present concept,\neach pixel would contain three micromachined, electrostatically adjustable\nFabry-Perot interferometers, each serving as a modulator for light of one of\nthree wavelengths (see figure). Each\nmicromachined interferometer would\ncontain two parallel, fiat, partially transparent mirrors - one on a springy silicon nitride membrane and the other on\na stationary glass substrate. The mirrors\nand the gap between them would constitute an optical cavity with resonant transmission peaks at wavelengths equal to\ninteger submultiples of twice the size of\nthe gap; that is, the interferometer\nwould transmit most of the light at these\nwavelengths and reflect most of the light\nat other wavelengths.\nThe nominal size of the gap in each\nmicromachined interferometer would\nbe selected so that its resonant wavelength in the visible part of the spectrum\nwas that of the desired color. The display\npanel would be illuminated with white\nlOa\t\n\nTransmitted\nRed Light (X 1 )\n\nTransmitted\t\nGreen Light (Ag)\t\n\nTransmitted\nBlue Light (Xe)\nSi3N4\nMembrane\n\nj2\t\n\nd3\n\n1 ii\t H\t\n\nII\n\n- Color Filter\n(Optional)\n\nNormally Incident White Light\nMODULATORS IN "ON" STATE\n\n3\t 4\nMembrane\nMirrors\n\nReflected\nLight\n\n________________\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Color Filter\n(Optional)\n\nI\nNormally Incident White Light\nMODULATORS IN "OFF" STATE\nEach of Three Micromachined Interferometers in a pixel would either transmit light at a resonant\nwavelength 2J when relaxed at gap d,, or else would not transmit when its mirrors were pulled together by voltage applied to electrostatic-deflection electrodes.\n\nlight from its back side (the lower side in\nthe figure). Optionall y, color filters\ncould be formed on the back side registered with the corresponding interferometers to provide additional selectivity\nfor greater purity of the colors.\nWhen voltage was not applied to the\nelectrostatic-deflection electrodes, the\nspringy silicon nitride membrane in each\ninterferometer would maintain the nominal gap and therefore light of the nominal wavelength would pass through to the\nfront (top in the figure) side, where it\nwould be seen. When voltage was applied\nto the electrostatic-deflection electrodes\nof a given color interferometer in a given\npixel, the spring force would be overcome and the two mirrors drawn together; this would eliminate the resonant gap,\ncausing the two mirrors to act as ordinary\nmirrors so that light would not pass\nthrough to the front. The net effect\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nwould be that each interferometer would\nact as a light valve or modulator for its\nassigned color. Thus, by opening each\nlight valve for a specified fraction of each\nimage-repetition cycle, one could mix\nspecified proportions of each color. Since\nthe viewer\'s eye could not spatially resolve\nthe individual interferometers or temporally resolve the individual flashes of\nlight, the viewer would get the impression\nof a desired composite color emanating\nfrom the pixel.\nThis work was done by Ton\' K T Tang,\nLinda M.

The double-core Bragg\ngrating fiber optic sensor consists of a\nfiber optic designed to transmit different wavelengths of light. Bragg gratings\nat two wavelengths are written at the\nsame location on the fiber optic. The\nresponse from these gratings can be\nused to simultaneously determine both\nthe strain and temperature on the fiber\noptic. The multiple overlapping grating method further enhances the separation of variables by allowing separation of x-axis strain, y-axis strain, z-axis\nstrain, and temperature from one sensing location.\nHigh-speed sensor signal readout is\nimproved via an additional pending\npatent that allows efficient integration\nof multiple strings of sensors and the\nuse of less expensive sources at the same\ntime. This technique could readily be\nadapted to telecom applications to\nreduce cost.\nBragg gratings represent a relatively\nsimple, compact, and low-cost approach to measuring strain or temperature in carbon and glass composite\nembedding applications. The simplicity arises because there is no need to\nmeasure optical phase, and hence no\nneed for a coherent light source. Light\ndemodulation instruments are difficult\nand costly to manufacture; thus the use\nof Bragg gratings results in a significant\ncost savings. Since these gratings can\nbe written at different wavelength,.\nmany individual sensors can be\nlength-division-multiplexed and \twgrated onto a single fiber optic strand.\nJune 1998\t\n\nLooking for outstanding quality, unique laser diode products,\nand excellent service?

Typical fiber diameters have\nranged from 100 to 250 pm.\nPreparation of a feed rod begins with mixing of metallic or\nceramic powders with an organic hinder. The powders are\nformulated with a modified stoichiometric composition; that\nis, the composition is chosen to obtain the desired fiber crystal composition, taking account of anticipated losses of various constituents through differential vaporization from the\nmelt. The mixture of powders and organic binder is extruded to produce the feed rod. The organic binder is typically a\ncommercial water-soluble cellulose ether product formulated\nto obtain the desired extrusion properties and to vaporize\nduring subsequent laser heating, leaving behind little or no\nresidue.\nThe feed rod is mounted vertically on a vertical-translation\nmechanism inside the vacuum chamber. A seed crystal\n(which could be a piece of previously grown fiber) is placed\nin the desired orientation by use of x-ray diffraction for measurement and a goniometem- for adjustment. The oriented\nseed crystal is mounted in the desired orientation on the tip\nof a pull rod that is collinear with the feed rod and is connected to another, independently controllable vertical-translation mechanism inside the vacuum chamber.\nThe laser beam is split into two beams aimed at the floating-zone melt location from opposite sides. The tip of the\nfeed rod and the seed crystal on the tip of the pull rod are\nslowly brought toward each other and into the laser-heated\nfloating zone, causing them to begin to melt (see Figure 2).\nEventuall y, the molten tips touch and wet each other. Once a\nstable molten zone with a relatively uniform temperature profile has been established, growth of a single-crystal fiber can\nbegin.\nTo effect this growth, the feed rod is translated toward the\nlaser-heated zone at one speed while the pull rod is translated away from the laser-heated zone at a different speed. The\nratio between the speeds is chosen to obtain the desired\nchange from the diameter of the feed rod to the diameter of\nthe fiber. Ordinarily, one seeks to produce a fiber narrower\nthan the feed rod, so that the pull rod must he translated\nJune 1998\n\n(Q)\n\nWescon(@)1@@\n\nNorth America\'s Largest\nElectronics Technology Event\nfor the OEM Marketplace\n\nSeptember 15 - 17, 1998\r\nAnaheim Convention Center, Anaheim, California\nfeaturing\n\nIC EXPO\xc2\xae\nIntegrating Semiconductor & EDA Technologies\nwith a special focus on \'Systems-on-a-Chip\'\nVisit\r\nwww.wescon.com\r\nfor information and registration!\n- --- t_ - - --- - - -m - .\n\nU\n\nFeed\nRod\nLaser\nBeam\n\nLaser\t\nBeam\t\nMelt\n\n-.----Seed Crystal\n---- Pull Rod\n\n_J\nMELTING BEGINS WHEN \t\nFEED ROD INTERCEPTS\t\nLASER BEAM\t\n\nCRYSTAL GROWTH BEGINS\t\nAFTER SEED CRYSTAL\t\nTOUCHES MOLTEN TIP OF\nFEED ROD\n\nSINGLE-CRYSTAL FIBER\nPULLED FROM MELT\n\nFigure 2. The Seed Crystal and Feed Rod are brought together in the laser-heated zone. Once a stable melt has been established, the feed rod is slowly fed into the laser-heated zone while the pull rod\nis withdrawn to pull out the growing fiber.\nmore rapidly. The translation can be\neither downward as in Figure 2, or else\nupward.\nA technique called "melt modulation" is used to maintain stability and\n\nsymmetry in the molten zone. Melt\nmodulation is effected by optomechanically scanning the opposing laser\nbeams back and forth across the feedrod/fiber axis to obtain more nearly\n\neven heating. Melt modulation gives\nrise to small vibrations that help to stabilize the molten zone. The vibrations\nalso increase thermal agitation and\nmixing, thereby helping to make the\ntemperature more nearly uniform\nthroughout the melt. The vibrations\nalso help to shake bubbles out of the\nmelt; without the vibrations, small bubbles tend to coalesce into one large\nbubble in the molten zone, with consequent disruption of crystal growth. The\nfrequency of vibration can he adjusted\nto avoid mechanical resonances and\nminimize vibration of the growing crystal. Typically, the optimum frequency\nlies between 30 and 50 Hz.\nThis work was done ly Frank Ritzert and\nLeonard Wesifall of Lewis Research\nCenter.

These lasers provide a combination of\nextremely narrow linewidth, broad tunability, and ease of\nuse, making them some of the most versatile lasers available.\nUntil recently, the accessible wavelengths have been limited to\nthe 0.6-1.6-pm region where commercial laser diodes are available.

Schematic of a Modified Littman-Metcalf Laser Cavity.\n\nTo develop this technology, researchers designed and fabricated a new strained-layer InGaAs/InP quantum-well ridgewaveguide semiconductor laser. Tensile strain was then added\nin the barrier region to extend the operating wavelength\nbeyond 2.0 pm. To suppress laser oscillation between the facets\nof the diode, an antireflection coating was deposited onto the\noutput facet. The quality of the antireflection coating is critical\nto achieving single-mode operation with narrow linewidths and\nwide tuning ranges, as oscillations between the facets will interfere with the effectiveness of the external cavity.\nThe laser is then placed in an external cavity with a grating\nin a Littman-Metcalf grazing incidence configuration, as illustrated in Figure 1, The grating serves as the wavelength-selective Output coupler. The narrow linewidth is a result of the\nhighly dispersive nature of the grating, which forces the laser\nto oscillate in a single longitudinal mode at any given setting.\nAdjusting the angle of the feedback mirror (or retroreflector)\nwith respect to the grating tunes the output wavelength. There\nare two methods of doing this: a DC motor provides rapid (>10\nnm/s) coarse tuning over the entire tuning range of greater\nthati 70 nm.

Pulse-tube Refrigerators use helium as the working\nfluid, which is nontoxic to humans and\nharmless to the environment.\nPulse-tube Refrigerators can be operated over a wide range of temperatures.\nThese units can be used in numerous\nspace and commercial refrigeration\napplications, including food refrigerator/freezers, laboratory freezers, and\nfreeze dryers. Pulse-tube Refrigerators\ncan also be used to cool detectors and\nelectronic devices.\nPulse-tube Refrigeration, a variation of\nthe Stirling cycle, is a relative newcomer\ncompared to other refrigeration cycles.\nThe Pulse-tube Refrigerator is the first\nunit applied to the temperature range\nand load level needed for typical food\nfreezers and laboratory freezers.\nThe design of the Pulse-tube Refrigerator unit was based on the Orifice\nPulse-tube concept. First, the gas is compressed in the compressor. Next, it flows\nthrough the compressor aftercooler,\nwhere heat is rejected to a water-cooling\nloop. Then the gas flows through the\nregenerator, which is basically an economizer, conserving cooling from one cycle\nto the next. The gas then enters the coldend heat exchanger where heat is added\nto the gas from the surroundings.\n\nThe gas finall y enters the Pulse Tube,\norifice, and reservoir. These three components produce the phase shift of the mass\nflow and pressure, which is necessary for\ncooling. The gas shuttles back and forth\nbetween the hot and cold ends rather\nthan circulating continuously around a\nloop, as in some refrigeration cycles. Heat\nis lifted against the temperature gradient\nand rejected at the hot-end heat exchanger, which is also water-cooled.\nThe compressor designed and built\nfor this unit is a dual-opposed-piston\ntype. The displacement of these two pistons is 180 out of phase, to reduce vibrations. The compressor, which can be\noperated over a wide range of frequencies, is designed for operation at a nominal 60 Hz.\nThe compressor pistons are supported by helical mechanical springs which\nassist in producing harmonic motion\nand return the pistons to the needed\nnull positions before startup. The pistons are supported inside the cylinders\non dry lubricated, low-friction sleeve\nbearings. Each piston is attached to a\nseparate moving coil, which is formed by\nwrapping copper wire around the end of\na spool. When voltage is applied to a\ncoil, the resulting current produces a\nforce on the coil.\nOptical encoders provide real-time\nreadout of all piston positions. These\nencoders use a noncontacting interrupter scale between a light-emitting-\n\ndiode source and sensors to detect\nmotion. A tachometer pulse and direction signal are generated.\nThe cold-end and hot-end heat exchangers consist of fine mesh copper\nscreens, fabricated in-house using proprietary techniques.\nAfter design and fabrication, the Pulsetube Refrigerator unit was subjected to\nnumerous tests. A temperature of \xe2\x80\x9445 \xc2\xb0C\nwas reached, which is well below the temperature required for food freezers.\nPulse-tube Refrigerators offer increased reliability, fewer moving parts,\nand much lower cold-end vibration than\nother spacecraft or commercial refrigeration concepts.\nThis work was done by W G.

By maintaining vacuum through all processing\nsteps, one prevents the formation of surface oxides, which interfere with cold\nwelding. Maintaining vacuum also prevents the formation of pockets of trapped\ngas, which render the bond nonuniform.\nIn the original application for which\nthe apparatus was designed, the objects\nto be joined are components of an ultrasonic transducer: namely, a piezoelectric\n(e.g., lithium niobate) wafer as thin as\n0.001 in. (25 pm) and a round sapphire\nrod with a flat surface (to mate with the\nwafer) at one end and a concave focusing surface at the other end. The faying\nsurfaces of the rod and disk must be\ncoated with thin layers of chromium,\nthen gold, then indium, by sputtering or\nvapor deposition in a vacuum. Then the\nwafer is pressed onto the end of the rod\nwith a pressure of about 300 kg/cm2\n(about 0.1 MPa) to cold-weld the rod\nand disk together at the indium surface\nlayers. Thinness and uniformity of the\nbond layers and uniformity of the coldweld joint are necessary for propel\nacoustic performance.\nThe apparatus includes a collet that\nholds the sapphire rod and a rotating\narm that contains a swivel disk, on which\nthe wafer is held by a layer of wax. The\narm enables the initial pickup of the prealigned wafer, the orientation of the\nwafer facing a metal-deposition source,\nand the repositioning of the wafer for\nsubsequent bonding to the rod. During\ncoating with metal, both the rod and the\nwafer are oriented with the bonding surfaces to be coated facing the source of\nthe metal. The chromium, gold, and\nindium layers are deposited from three\ndifferent sources. The apparatus\nincludes a turntable so that the rod and\nwafer can be positioned below each of\nthe three sources in sequence.\nThe collet is mounted in a springloaded holder, the springs of which are\npreadjtmsted to provide the appropriate\nbonding force. The springs are compressed and restrained by a cam-actuated lever. The cam is driven by a linearand-rotary vacuum feedthrough that\nenables actuation without breaking vacuum. The feedthrough can be made to\nengage a cam socket when the angular\nposition of the rotary table is such that\nthe cam socket and the feedthroitgh arc\naligned with each other.\nA similar feedthrough and cam-actuation mechanism is provided for the positioning arm.

The laboratory equipment includes a controlled-temperature bath, two\ndigital multimeters for processing the outputs of two temperature transducers at a time, and standard interface bus circuitry\nfor controlling and monitoring the bath and the multimeters.\nThe operation of the laboratory equipment is controlled by\nequipment-specific software on a computer that runs Windows\n95 and is equipped with a standard general-purpose interface\nbus circuit card. A technician specifies data points for calibration, and thereafter the software controls the calibration\nprocess. The process includes timed advances to subsequent\ntemperatures and holding periods for stabilization at calibration temperatures, with a sampling period of 1 second. The\ntechnician can leave the system unattended during the calibration process. Using manual techniques, it usually takes\nabout half a day to calibrate two temperature transducers at\nthree data points; using this system, it takes about two hours.\nThis work was done by Timothy Joe Ragain of United Space Alliance\nfor Kennedy Space Center.

These two devices must then\nbe linked together using hard-wiring, a\nserial interface, or some other communication interface. The resulting system\nis frequently difficult to program and\nmaintain, and may suffer performance\nproblems as well. For example, users\nmust write separate application programs for both controls, typically with\ntwo different programming packages.\nRockwell Automation\'s new modular\napproach involves a controller and one\nor more motion modules, all residing in\nthe same hardware chassis as the controller. The controller plays an expanded role, to include motion instructions\nembedded in firmware. The generalpurpose programming software provides\nfull motion programming and configuration support for the controller.\n\nUN I RUL\n\nCOMPONENTS\nThe three components of this new\napproach are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Controller(s).

As\nthe heart of this approach, the controller performs all of the high-level\nmotion command execution and\nmotion trajectory planner functions,\nin addition to the traditional sequential control (counting, timing, shifting) functions. The 27 motion commands embedded on the controller\nsupport a range of motion functions\nfrom simple point-to-point moves to\nmore complex ratioing moves. These\nmotion commands are based on\nthose found in other commonl y used\nmotion controllers. Up to eight servo\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nmodules (or 16 axes) can he controlled by a single controller.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Motion modules. The motion modtile is the 2-axis servo module for\nthe ControlLogix system (Figure 1).\nIt provides two channels of 16-bit\nanalog output, and two channels\nof quadrature encoder input. This\nallows it to connect to a wide variety\nof servo drives. All needed configuration parameters are sent to the\nmotion module by the controller. As\na result, the motion module does not\nrequire separate configuration or\nprogramming. The module contains\na digital signal processor (DSP) that\nprovides very fast 100-ps fine trajectory planner, position loop, and velocity loop closure.\t\nContinued\nJune 1998\n\nMiniature DC Servo\nActuators Mini RH Series\nHD Systems offers a line of miniature DC ser\nactuators for use in applications such as robotic\ninstrumentation, and factory automation who\nprecise motion control is required.

These motors\ncould be used to make tine position\nadjustments in diverse scientific and\nindustrial instruments that operate at\ntemperatures ranging from near absolute zero to room temperature; for\nexample, they could be used to drive\ntranslation stages in scanning tunneling\nmicroscopes that operate at liquid-helium temperature (4 K), or to move cryogenic-temperature optical elements that\nmust be located at long but precise distances from each other (as in interfer-\n\nlinear actuator is mounted on the platform, and a substantial mass (the inertial-reaction mass) is attached to the\nother end. The actuator can be made to\nmove the mass, rapidly or slowly, along a\nshort range parallel to the track. If the\nmass is driven with sufficient acceleration that the reaction force overcomes\nthe friction between the platform and\nthe track, then the platform moves a\nshort distance along the track. If, following a rapid stroke in the forward direction, the mass is driven relatively slowly\nin the reverse direction, then the reaction force is insufficient to overcome\nfriction, and thus the platform remains\n\nThis Magnetostrictive inertial .

[These motors should not be\nconfused with proposed magnetostrictive motors that would move in "inchworm" fashion and would be used for\nsimilar purposes, described in "Magnetostrictive Actuators for Cryogenic\nApplications," NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 20,\nNo. 3 (March 1996), page 84.]\nAn inertial-reaction motor includes a\nplatform that slides along a pair of\ntracks.

By driving the actuator with a sawtooth waveform at the\nappropriate amplitude and frequency,\none can cause the actuator to repeat this\naction and thus move the platform in a\nsuccession of small steps. The total distance traveled can range from a single\nstep to the length of the tracks, which\ncould be as much as I m or more in\nsome instruments. The motion can be\n\nreversed by inverting the waveform driving the actuator.\nThe principle of operation as described thus far does not call for any particular type of linear actuator. Heretofore, inertial-reaction motors have\nbeen constructed with piezoelectric\nactuators. However, piezoelectric actuators exhibit diminished performance as\ntemperature decreases into the cryogenic range; at liquid-helium temperatures (about 4 K), piezoelectric actuators perform poorly.\nUnlike piezoelectric actuators, magnetostrictive actuators perform well at\ntemperatures from ambient down to 4 K\nand below; indeed, magnetostrictive\nactuators reach their performance peaks\nat cryogenic temperatures, while at\nroom temperature, they produce strokes\nabout 7 times as large as those of comparable piezoelectric actuators. Moreover, if the magnetostrictive linear actuators for cryogenic inertial-reaction motors are constructed with superconducting solenoids, then the conversion of\nelectrical to mechanical energy could be\nmore efficient.\nThe feasibility of magnetostrictive\ninertial-reaction motors has been demonstrated in tests of such a motor built\nwith a commercial room-temperature\nmagnetostrictive actuator (see figure).\nIncremental motions as small as 100 nm\nhave been achieved. With further development, it should be possible to achieve\nincrements as small as 10 nm.\nThis work was done fr Christian Lindensmith and Robert Chave of Caltech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The end of the\nscrew is secured on a plate, which slides\non four posts to provide counterrotation. This plate also prevents any axial\nmisalignment of the screw and houses\nthe load cell. The four posts provide a\nframe that attaches to a top plate to support the motor and a bottom plate to\nsupport the cylinder of the piston\nextruder. These elements form a very\nstiff mechanical linkage with very low lag\nor backlash and produce very precise\n\nvolumetric displacement of material.\nThe cylindrical pancake motors for\nthis invention were designed to eliminate gear reductions and avoid backlash\nin direct- drive equipment. Because the\nstator has been moved to the outside of\nthe rotor, these motors produce very\nhigh torque at extremely low and controlled angular velocities. The increased\nradius and mass of the rotor translate to\nvery high torque and rotor inertia. Also,\nthe cylindrical motor is hollow, which\nallows the ball nut to fit inside the\nmotor.

The navigation system\nprovides information allowing the\nmachine to cut to a predetermined\nmine plan. Many different navigation\ndevices were evaluated in an effort to\nidentify the best one for use on the\nmachine. The Honeywell ring laser\ngyro known as HORTA was selected as\nthe best navigation device for the application. The data provided by the gyro\nincludes position of the machine in\nstate plane coordinates (feet); position\nof the appendages of the mining\nmachine in state plane coordinates;\nheading of the mining machine\n(degrees); pitch, roll, and yaw of the\nmachine (degrees); altitude above sea\nlevel, cross-track and along track.\nInvestigators developed a fieldbus\nstyle of control network based on BITBUS standards that allows non-line-ofsight control of all the mining\nmachine\'s moving parts. The control\nnetwork consists of a microcontroller\nboard in a 19-in, rack in the control\ncenter that attaches to a single-board\nPC plugged into a passive PC backplane. The two ends of the control network are connected with a twisted cable\npair. The network uses a second fieldbus network to provide data collection\nof the positions of all the moving parts\nof the mining machine, as well as the\nstatus of the machine\'s critical parameters, such as motor currents, hydraulics,\npressures, temperatures, and other relevant parameters. This network consists\nof sensors, signal conditioning modules, and a microcontroller board on\nthe continuous miner, and a PC card\nthat plugs into a passive PC backplane\nin the 19-in, rack. The two ends of the\ndata network are connected with a twisted-pair cable. The third connection\nbetween the machine and the 19-in.\nrack is two twisted-pair cables that connect the machine-mounted gyro to a PC\nJune 1998\n\ncard that is plugged into the PC passive\nbackplane. The controller software is\nthe key element for providing advanced\nmining operations. By using the data\ncollected from all the continuous\nminer\'s sensors and the gyro and by\nexecuting commands on the miner, the\ncontroller is able to do complete coalcutting scenarios.\nMany modules can and have been\nadded to the design. Each module adds\nanother level of sophistication to the\nsystem. Using this method, the technology is capable of adapting to the most\nprimitive or most sophisticated application, simply by adding the modules\nrequired for the application.

They would\nachieve motion by use of simple electronically or photonically\ncontrolled, flexible advanced actuators instead of conventional motors with complex drive trains. The robots would carry\nadvanced microsensors for measuring or detecting specific\nobjects or substances. Animallike combinations of mobility,\nadaptability, fault tolerance and a limited capability for "learning" would be achieved by integrating the actuators with verylarge-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits that would implement\nneural-network and/or genetic algorithms.\nThe proposed earthwormlike robots would be flexible in the\nsense that they would be foldable in segments. The first several\nsegments at one or both end(s) of each robot would generate\nmotion. These segments would be covered with hinged plates\nconnected to interior actuators (see figure on page 12b). Upon\ncommand, the interior actuator in each segment would shorten\nor lengthen the segment, causing the plates to buckle outward\nor to move inward to straighten, respectively. A wave of shortening/buckling versus lengthening/straightening, resembling\nthe peristaltic motion of an earthworm, could be generated by\nsending coordinated, sequential contraction and expansion\ncommands to the actuators in the segments. By this action, the\nrobot could move along the surface or burrow beneath the surface of terrain. The direction of travel could be reversed by\nreversing the sequence of buckling and straightening.\nSpecial-purpose microsensors could be housed in one or\nmore end or middle segment(s). The tips on the end segments\ncould be sharpened to facilitate penetration of soil. Alternatively or in addition, the tips could contain sensors and/or\nmechanisms to collect samples.\nThe design of the robot, including the details of the mobility features and the choice of sensors, would be specific to the\nintended application. For example, an earthwormlike robot\nmight be designed to probe earthquake rubble to find missing\npersons and animals.

The components would be fab-\n\nricated by micromachining.\nMb\t\n\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nJune 1998\n\nHowever, whereas typical transmission components are\nmachined individuall y and then assembled, this device would\nhe made using silicon batch-fsbrication techniques, similar to\nthose used to manufacture integrated circuits and sensors.\nUntil now, onl y fixed-ratio gear trains have been available for\nminirnotors, affording no opportunity to change gears in operation to optimize for varying external conditions, or varying\nspeed, torque, and power requirements. This is because conventional multispeed gear-train geometries and actuation techniques do not lend themselves to cost-effective miniaturization.\nIn recent years, the advent of microelectromechanical systems\n(MEMS) and of microinachining techniques for making small\nactuators and gears has created the potential for economical\nmass production of multispeed transmissions for minimotors.\nIn addition, it should he possible to integrate these mechanisms\nwith sensors, such as tachometers and load cells, as well as circuits, to create integrated silicon systems, which could perform\nclosed-loop speed or torque control under a variety of conditions. In comparison with a conventional motor/transmission\nassembly, such a package would he smaller and lighter, contain\nfewer parts, consume less power, and impose less of a computational burden on an external central processing unit (CPU).\nLike conventional multispeed transmissions for larger\nmotors, miniature multispeed transmissions would contain\ngears, clutches, and brakes. However, the designs would be\nmore amenable to micromachining and batch fabrication. Gear\nstages would he nestled one inside the other (see figure on\npage 14b), rather than stacked one over the other, creating a\nmore planar device. Actuators and the housing would be fabricated on separate layers. The complex mechanical linkages and\nbearings used to shift gears in conventional transmissions\nwould not be practical at the small scales of interest here.\nPromising alternatives might include electrostatic-friction locks\nor piezoelectric actuators. For example, in the transmission\ndepicted in the figure, piezoelectric clamps would serve as actuators in clutches and brakes.\nThe structures would he aligned and bonded, followed b y a\nfinal etch to release the moving parts. The entire fabrication\nprocess can he automated, making it both precise and relatively inexpensive. The end product is a "gearbox on a chip\' which\ncan he "dropped \' onto a compatible motor to make an integrated drive system.\n\nVisit the NEW\nNASA Tech Briefs\n\nThis work was done by Indrani Chakrahorty and Linda Miller of\nCaliech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The scheme is\nused to compensate for inadequate\npath planning, problems such as joint\nlimiting, joint freezing, or even obstacle avoidance, where a desired position and orientation are not attainable due to an unrealizable joint command. Once a joint encounters a\nlimit, supplemental commands are\nsent to other joints to best track,\naccording to a selected criterion, the\ndesired trajectory.\nA standard six-degree-of-freedom\nmanipulator has six independently\ncontrolled joints. The position and\norientation of the end effector, each\nof which is described in three dimensions, are fully determined by the\nangles of the joints. As long as the\nappropriate joint angles are achievable, the desired position and orientation can be obtained. However, when\nthe specified joint trajectories cannot\nbe followed due to a command beyond the range of the actuator, positions and orientations downstream\nfrom the limited joint will all be affected, causing in some cases extreme\ndeviations from the expected values.\nThis new scheme is an ideal solution\ncandidate for this problem. It was\ndesigned to compensate for actuator\nsaturation in a multivariahie system by\nsupplementing the commands to the\nremaining actuators to produce the\ndesired effect on the output, in this\ncase the gripper position and orientation. For each joint which saturates, a\ndegree of freedom is lost, but the\nremaining joints can be used to track\nthe desired path within the physical\nlimits of the manipulator.\nThe matrix known as the Jacobian,f,\ndescribes how a small change in the\njoint positions, dq, affects the gripper.\nThe resulting position and orientation\nchange of the end effector, D, is corn-\n\njune 1998\n\nputed as D =Jdq. When a joint is commanded to move beyond its limit, a\nportion of the command cannot be\nachieved. This unmet demand, Aq,\nrepresents the amount the joints\nshould move but cannot. The resulting error in position and orientation\nof the end effector can be approximated by D=Jtq. The objective of this\nnew scheme is to duplicate D as closely as possible using joints with authority remaining.\nThe figure shows the scheme with\nthe optimal gains in the feedback\nloop. The commands, q, are checked\nto verify that they will not drive any of\nthe joints to a rate or position limit.\nAny portion of a command which\nwould cause a joint to saturate corresponds to unmet demand and is truncated and redirected to the feedback\ngains. The gains take this unmet\ndemand, iq, and produce some supplemental commands to unsaturated\njoints, q*, such that JAq and fq*are as\nclose as possible. These supplemental\ncommands allow the end effector to\noptimally track its desired trajectory,\neven in the face of joint position and\nrate limits. Since the algorithm acts\nupon the joint commands only, there\nis never the possibility of an unstable\nsystem resulting from the use of this\nalgorithm.\nThe optimal feedback gains are\ncomputed using a quadratic objective\nfunction with task-dependent weights\nassigned to the components of the\nposition and orientation vector of the\nend effector. The gains adapt to\nchanges in the Jacobian as the manipulator moves through its workspace,\nand the computations are robust to\nsingularities arising from particular\nmanipulator configurations. This provides smooth, continuous variation of\nthe optimal gains for as long as A q is\nnonzero.\nThis work was done by Ten-Huci Guo of\nLewis Research Center, Jonathan Litt\nof the Vehicle Technology Center of the U.S.\nArmy Research Laboratory, and Andr\xc3\xa9\nHickman of Morehouse College.

In a hybrid rocket engine, a solid\nfuel is burned by use of a liquid or\ngaseous oxidizer, the flow of which can\nbe throttled to control the engine.\nUnlike conventional solid rocket propellants, a solid rocket fuel can be\nmade relativel y inert in the absence of\n\nthe oxidizer and therefore presents little hazard of explosion or inadvertent\nignition. Unlike conventional (and relatively expensive) liquid rocket propellants, a solid rocket fuel is not corrosive\nor susceptible to leakage. The solid fuel\nin the proposed system would be in\ngranular form, packed into the rocket\nmotor. Oxygen or another suitable oxidizer could be transported from Earth\ntogether with this solid fuel. Alter-\n\nnatively, oxygen could be generated\nfrom CO2 in the Martian atmosphere\nby use of in-situ resource utilization\n(ISRU) equipment. Inasmuch as ISRU\nis not yet a mature technological discipline, some research on ISRU would be\nnecessary to estimate the reduction in\ncost achieved by not having to carry the\noxidizer to Mars.\nThis work was done by Kumar Ramohalli\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The rotation of the motor is transmitted to the main shaft of the spindle.\nThe main shaft supports a fixture that\nholds the tool to effect the desired\noperation. The main shaft is supported\nby a series of bearings that withstand\naxial and radial loads encountered during use. The pressure and flow rate can\nhe adjusted manually or controlled by a\ncomputer. This system includes a\nhydraulic subsystem that supplies pressurized fluid to drive the spindle.\nPressurized fluid is fed into the\nFor More Information Circle No. 668\n\nJulie 1998\n\nhydraulicall y driven spindle for machining, milling, drilling, tapping, facing, and joining. Hydraulic fluid volumetric flow rate, fluid pressure, gear\nsize, and geometry of the hydraulic\nmotor are variables which govern spindle torque and rotational speed, ranging from 5,000 to 6,000 rpm and operating at 1,000- to 6,000-psi (6.9- to 4MPa) pressures.\nThe bearing system for this hydraulically driven spindle can he made of\nrecently developed fluid bearings or of\nroller element type bearings. The balls\nin the hearings in this system can be\nmade of standard steel or of newlydeveloped ceramics for increased rigidity, accuracy, and longer life. Bearings\nthat are designed for use at lower\nspeeds with air/oil or air/mist lubrication can he used at higher speeds, provided they are lubricated with grease.\nHigh-speed machining allows for\nthe production of thin wall Sections\nwith minimal deformation. High-speed\nmachining can make it possible to\nreduce the number of parts, sometimes\neven making it possible to fabricate, as\nunitary parts, objects that would ordinarily have to he assembled from multiple pieces. Therefore, production and\nassembl y times are reduced.\nFor the purpose of fabricating complex and thin-walled parts, high-speed\nmachining of solid stock can he an\nalternative to casting and to the more\nexpensive use of composite materials.\nUse of this h y draulicall y driven spindle\nsystem for high-speed machining reduces times and cost of the manufacturing process and helps to ensure\ndefect-free finished parts.\nAnother significant advantage of\nhigh-speed machining is minimization\nof effects of heat on machined parts.\nMost of the cutting heat is removed,\nreducing thermal warping and increasing the life of the cutting tool. In many\ncases, the need for a cooling fluid is\neliminated. Also, elimination of cutting\nfluids reduces subsequent contributions to pollution and aids in the recovery and recycling of such expensive\nmaterials as aluminum-lithium alloys.\nThis work was done In A1o1,d K.

The procedure\nis intended for use in processing data\nfrom aircraft flight tests.\nSome background information is prerequisite to an explanation of this development. Deterministic nonstationary\ninput test signals are often essential for\nextracting aeroelastic-stability trends from\nnoisy measurements. The analysis of flight\ndata is improved by discrimination among\nareas of low signal-to-noise ratio, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances.\nWavelet signal processing has shown\npromise for identification of the conceptual structures, operators, and parameters\nof mathematical models (hereafter called\n"system identification") of aeroservoelastic systems for these purposes.\nNonparametric wavelet filtering\nremoves aspects of signal responses detrimental to linear system-identification\nmethods to improve stability tracking.\nWavelet transforms are also used to directly supply information on time-dependent\nmodal decay rates and phases for estimation of parameters of mathematical models of time-varying systems. Without any\napproximation of the range of parameters of a system, natural frequencies and\ndamping ratios are extracted from the\nresponse of the system. Damping and frequency trends are useful for noting\nchanges in system dynamics as functions\nof flight conditions.\nModel validation is a critical procedure\nin the computation of robust stability margins. The margins are adversely affected\nby poor characterizations of uncertainty\nsize and structure, which are determined\nby the magnitudes of perturbations, locations of perturbations within the system,\nand the types (real or complex) of perturbations. This completes the background information.\nIn the present wavelet-based modalparameter-extraction procedure, both\ncomplex, nonparametric and real, parametric perturbations are decreased to\ngenerate reduced-norm uncertainty sets,\nNASA Tech Bnefs,June 1998\t\n\nFor More Information Circle No. 409 \t\n\n81\n\n\t\n\nModel\n\nData\t\n4,x(t)\t\nWavelet\t\nTransform\t\n\nI\nI\n\nI P(s)\n\nX(tu)\n\nFilter\nModel\t\nEstimation\n\nI\t\n\nX(r cc)\t\nInverse Wavelet I \t\nTransform\t\n\nLowest Cost\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nData Acquisition\nI\n\nast Fourie\n\n\t\n\nADAC\'s new Value-Line has\n\nodel\t\nLVM\n\nIdation I F(P,)\t\n\nLIII---"-\n\nr\n\nuncompromising design features\nand high quality components at\nprices below the low cost guys!\n\nThe Flows of Information represented graphically here are those that occur when the p method is\ncoupled with wavelet processing for robust stability-margin analysis of an aeroservoelastic system.\n\nPlus drivers for Windows NT,\nWindows 95, 3.1 and DOS.\nJust check the specs:\n\nLowest Cost\n5500MF\n\n8 channels 12-bit A/D,\n16 digital I/O, Counter/Timer\n\nHigh Speed\n5508LC\t\n\nST 416\n\n8 channels 12-bit AID,\n100KHz, DMA\n\nMulti-I/O, 01144\n5516DMA\n\n16 channels 12-bit AID,\nDMA, 16 digital I/O\n\nHigh Resolution\n5500HR\n\n16 channels 16-bit A/D,\nDMA, 8 digital I/O\n\nHigh Performance Data\nAcquisition Since 1974\n\nvoice\t\n\n800-648-6589\n\nfax\t\n\n181-938-6553\n\nweb\t\n\nwww.adac.com\n\nemail\t\n\ninfo@adac.com\n\nADAC\nAmerican Data Acquisition Corporation\n70 Tower Office Park, Woburn MA 01801\nFor More Information Circle No. 432\n\nwhich result in models with less conservatism. The models are used in a robust\nstability-boundary-prediction method\ncalled the "p method" because it is based\non a structured singular value called "p."\n[This method was described in\n"Characterizing Worst-Case Flutter\nMargins From Flight Data" (DRC-97-03).\nNASA Tech Beiefi, Vol. 21, No. 4 (April\n1997), page 62.1\nWithin the p conceptual framework, a\nsystem is represented as an operator,\nF(P4), which, in turn, represents a feedback interconnection of a plant P and\nuncertainty A. Flight data can be incorporated into the p method by formulating a\ndescription of uncertainty that accounts\nfor observed variations and errors. A\nmodel-validation analysis is performed on\nthe plant model to ensure that the range\nof dynamics admitted by the uncertainty is\nsufficient to cover the range of dynamics\nobserved with the flight data.\nThe p method can he coupled with\nwavelet processing for parametric and\nnonparametric estimation. This coupling is achieved by introducing, into\nthe basic process, several time-frequency\noperations based on wavelet filtering\n(see figure). Wavelet transform operations are introduced to process timedomain data, x(t), before computation\nof a frequency-domain representation.\nK ((o). These operations map the timedomain data into the time-frequency\ndomain via a wavelet transform, then\nmap them back to the time domain via\nan inverse wavelet transform. A time-frequency filtering operation is performed\nbetween the wavelet transform and the\ninverse wavelet transform to remove\nunwanted features before the inverse\n\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nwavelet transform yields a time-domain\nsignal, x (t).\nA modal-parameter-estimation algorithm is introduced by use of the wavelet\nalgorithm. The estimated parameters\nare used to update the elements of a\nnominal plant model, P, and a new plant\nmodel, P, is used to represent the\ndynamics of the ae rose rvoelastic system.\nThe final operations of the p method\nare traditional robust-stability operations on frequency-domain data. The\neffect of the wavelet filtering is to introduce filtered versions of the data and\nthe plant model for model validation.\nThus, a new uncertainty operator, A, is\nassociated with the parameter-updated\nplant, P, to account for errors observed\nfrom the filtered data, (t). There is\ncomputed a robust stability margin, F,\nthat describes the largest change in\ndynamic pressure for which Pis robustly\nstable to the errors, A.\nNominal stability margins are computed for the plant model by use of the original theoretical modal parameters and are\ncomputed for the updated model by use\nof parameters estimated from wavelet filtering. These margins are computed from\na p analysis with respect to variation in dynamic pressure, q, but ignoring the modal\nand complex uncertainty operators.\nThis tooth was done by Martin].

Muscle wires\nare commercially available in kit form\nin the hobby market, and have been\ndescribed (though not explicitly called\n"muscle wires") in previous articles in\nNASA Tech Briefs. A muscle wire is made\nof a shape-memory alloy. By sending a\nsufficient electric current along the\nwire, one can heat the wire above its\ntransition temperature, causing it to\nchange length. When the current is\nturned off, the wire cools, returning to\nits original length. The aspects of muscle wires that make them attractive for\nplane tary-explora t ion robots are low\nmass, simplicity, and the ability to exert\nlarge tensile forces (thousands of times\ntheir own weights); in these aspects,\nmuscle wires are superior to conventional electric motors. Moreover,\nbecause of their low thermal masses,\nmuscle wires would respond to turn-on\nand turn-off of currents rapidly enough\nfor the actuation frequencies needed in\nplanetary-exploration robots.\nThis work was done by Kumar Ra7nohai1i\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The people at\nThe Aerospace Corporation know that. So they rely on a\npowerful data analysis and visualization software package\nclled-IDL to make it a little easier.\nThe Aerospace Corporation\'s business involves designing\nand testing the most powerful, safest and environmentally sound propulsion systems for satellite launches.\nA special team, led by Dr. And y Mcllroy, uses IDL, the\nInteractive Data Language, for combustion data analysis.\nIDL allows them to quickly manipulate and display data.\nIt allows them to test ignition methods and develop combustion formulas with minimal environmental impact.\nAnd they can share their work between Windows. Unix\nand Power Macintosh machines heL.suse of IDUs unique\ncross-platform design.\n\nI\t\n\nlIthe color images\r\n7e,rerated by I\'larsar\r\nLoser Induced\r\n\nI\n\ncIur,-escence (PLIF)\n\n? z -;o 01)\n\nit\n\nrocket\'s\n\niQ U1\xc2\xb0\nCl) u\n\nscience\n\nr\n\n5\xe2\x80\x94"\n\n"At The Aerospace Corporacion, we use IDL software\nbecause of its flexibility and abilit y to run on lots of\ndifferent devices in our lab. The data processing capabilities let me see what\'s happening in ways I need to," Dr.\nMcllroy says.\nThousands of other people also use IDL to turn their\ndata into useful information. People like Dr. Amir\nNajmi, of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics\nLab, who is developing optimal processing methods for\nelectromagnetic and acoustic data. "Once I have an\nidea," says Najmi, "I can quickly prototype that idea and\nsee the results almost instantly."\n\nAll^\t\n\nor\n\nFind out how IDL can help you improve your analysis\nand make better decisions from your data.
