An important motivation for our investigations is to aid in the interpretation of pick-up ion (PUI) and anomalous cosmic ray (ACR) observations which depends on knowledge of the flux of neutral atoms of various elements into the heliosphere. This flux depends on the ionization and elemental abundances of the gas of the Local Cloud. We have made substantial progress in our program to understand the ionization of the Local Cloud. Our steady state photoionization models are remarkably successful in accounting for the ionization observed both by line of sight (column density) observations towards nearby stars and in situ measurements. By lifting some of the simplifying assumptions in our earlier modeling we hope to make further progress in this understanding. In future work on this project we will continue our exploration of photoionization models, focusing on making sense of the differences between the LIC and the BC. In addition we will explore the effects of altered abundances in the hot gas on the ionization and thermal balance in the LIC.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030063904, "id": "63da0e5963b24e8a9f1d4c64d7e2271e", "publicationDate": "2003-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
