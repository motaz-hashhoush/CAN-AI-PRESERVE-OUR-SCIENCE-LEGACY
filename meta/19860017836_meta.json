In other words, it was the objective of our experiments in the Space to observe the  surface tension of liquid by means of making a solid collide with a liquid. Place a small volume of water between 2 glass sheets to make a thin water membrane: the 2 ass sheets cannot be separated unless an enormous force is applied. \n\nAlso, fill a cup with water to the brim, place a sheet of  paper on top of it, and turn the cup upside down gently: the water inside the cup does not spill out. It is obvious from these phenomena that the surface tension of water is far greater than presumed. On the earth, however, it is impossible in most cases to observe only the surface tension of liquid, because gravity always acts on the  surface tension", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 19860017836, "endDate": "1985-10-09T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "e081fcbdcd5059fa8fa7b6c5c6a2c483", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, Maryland, United States"}}, "meetingId": "7ca6a2c4afd845d88bb30ab2cb982cf4", "id": "38bf6e6a3bfd41319f07976d30e35f73"}], "name": "Get Away Special Experimenter's Symposium", "location": "Greenbelt, MD", "id": "7ca6a2c4afd845d88bb30ab2cb982cf4", "startDate": "1985-10-08T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860017836, "publisher": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "id": "55c581bfff764ec7a5febbf9a3a06c46", "publicationName": "1985 Get Away Special Experimenter's Symposium", "publicationDate": "1985-10-08T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "issuePublicationDate": "1986-01-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19860017825, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "The 1985 Get Away Special Experimenter's Symposium", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19860017836.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19860017836/downloads/19860017836.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19860017836/downloads/19860017836.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19860017836/downloads/19860017836.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
