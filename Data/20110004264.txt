Flick your wrist and\nsuddenly you are transformed into a\nsingle molecule speeding through the\nhuman circulatory system.\nWelcome to the brave new world of\nvirtual reality (VR) , where you can be\nanything and anywhere you\nwant to be-given the right\nsoftware program.

Sensors lining the\nglove communicate hand\nmovements to a graphics\ncomputer.\nPhoto courtesy VPL Research tnc\n\nthe display via cable . A sensor on the\ngoggles tracks head position and orientation , allowing the computer to shift the\nimage in correlation with your head movements. Headphones provide three-dimensional audio, enhancing the illusion\nof being inside the display.\nNASA and the Department of Defense developed the first VR systems\nfor specialized applications such as flight\nsimulation . Now the technology is moving from the research laboratories into\nthe private sector, with uses ranging\nfrom computer-aided design and communications to education and entertainment. "We\'re just beginning to scratch\nthe surface in terms of commercial\ndevelopment," said NASA scientist Dr.\nMichael McGreevy, who designed the\nVirtual Workstation (NTB Vol. 12, Num.\n7), considered the first practical VR\nsystem .\nOne of the leading purveyors of virtual reality products is VPL Research\nInc. of Redwood City, CA. With NASA\'s\nassistance, VPL developed the DataGlove , a sensor-lined Iycra glove that\nconverts hand gestures and positions\ninto computer-readable form , enabling\nthe wearer to interact with simulated\nenvironments and control the action. "It\nlets you pick up and handle objects in\nthe virtual world as if they are real," said\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\nAnn Lasko , director of product design at\nVPL. "If you hold your hand in front of\nyour face you see a virtual version of\nyour hand. You can wiggle your virtual\nfingers."\nTested extensively as part of the\nVirtual Workstation , the DataGlove incorporates fiber optic sensors that\nmeasure flexion and extension of the\nfingers, and a Polhemus magnetic tracking device that determines the hand\'s\nposition and orientation. A microprocessor-based control unit transmits data\nfrom the glove to the host computer.\nIn addition to its role as an interface\nfor VR systems, the DataGlove can be\nused to control conventional computer\nscreens, replacing mice and joysticks.\n"It provides a natural, intuitive way to\ninteract with your computer," said Ms.\nLasko. Mattei Inc. has introduced a plastic\nglove based on VPL\'s technology as an\naccessory for Nintendo video games.\nThe "Power Glove" allows players to\ndirectly manipulate onscreen graphics.\n"You can use hand motions to throw a\nbailor battle a villian, " she explained.\nThe VPL glove also offers applications in telerobotics and biomedicine.\nNew York University researchers use\nthe device to control a dexterous robot\nhand, while Greenleaf Medical Systems\nof Palo Alto , CA, employs the glove in a\nsystem that measures how much the\ndifferent joints of the human hand can\nbend , enabling doctors to accurately\ndetermine hand impairment. Greenleaf\nrecently hooked up a speech synthesizer to the DataGlove to demonstrate\nthe capability for turning hand gestures\ninto audible words . They hope to develop a low-cost system that would translate sign language into speech.\nVPL has incorporated DataGlove\nprinciples into a suit that covers the\nentire human frame. This "DataSuit"\npermits full-body participation in virtual\nreality. Presently, the suit\'s main use is\nPlaying a game of "virtual" racquetball\nPhoto courtesy Autocesk Inc\n\nEyePhone wearer sees a 3D image of his hand while the same image is\ndisplayed on the monitor.\n\nA~\n\nto lend realistic motion to characters in\ncomputer-generated special effects. "An\nactor wears the suit, and every body\nmovement can be fed into the computer, " said Ms. Lasko.\n\nShared Realities\nThe company recently introduced a\nsystem called Reality Built for Two , or\nRB2, that enables multiple users to share\na virtual space and interact with one\nanother. The forms and behaviors of\nRB2\'s virtual worlds are specified graphically , so that non-programmers can\ndesign them. "You decide what you want\nyour virtual body to look like," said Ms.\nLasko. "The experience is like being at a\ncostume party except that the external\nenvironment can also be changed ."\nRB2\'s primary user input devices are\nthe DataGlove and a head-tracking\nPolhemus sensor attached to the 3D\ngoggles, or EyePhone. The design and\ncontrol workstation is a Mac II running a\nsolid modeling application called RB2\nSwivel and a real-time animation control\npackage known as Body Electric. Position and orientation data are translated\nby Body Electric into graphics commands\nfor the rendering software, Isaac, which\nruns on Silicon Graphics IRIS POWERSeries workstations. In order to maintain high frame rates, one IRIS is used\nfor each eye. The configuration utilizes\nEthernet and NTSC cables.\nVPL is now laying the groundwork for\na project called RealityNet which will\nconnect the company with RB2 users at\nthe University of North Carolina, MIT,\n\nand the Washington Technology Center\nin Seattle by way of modems and ordinary telephone lines. It could pave the\nway for a variety of mUlti-user applications of VR systems. In coming years,\nengineers separated by thousands of\nmiles may share a virtual workspace\nwhere they can collaborate on the design of aircraft or automobile components; they would be able to rotate a\npart or change its size and shape using\nsimple hand gestures such as pointing\nor waving. Similarly, a group of medical\nstudents may perform surgery on a virtual patient in a computer-generated\noperating room.\n\nVirtual Audio\nRB2 incorporates a three-dimensional\nsound reproduction system originally\ndeveloped for the Virtual Workstation by\nDr. Elizabeth Wenzel of NASA\'s Ames\nResearch Center and Scott Foster of\nCrystal River Engineering (CRE) Inc. , a\nCalifornia-based start-up company.\nCalled the Convolvotron, it is a digital\nsignal processing (DSP) system that\nenables the listener, using standard\nheadphones, to locate in space up to\nfour independent and simultaneous sound\nsources. At the heart of the Convolvotron is its exceptional processing\ncapacity-128 parallel multiply/accumulate/shift processors make the system\nmore than 20 times faster than conventionalDSPs.\nThe Convolvotron\'s utility extends\nbeyond virtual reality to fields such as\nhearing research, telecommunications,\n11\n\nand architectural acoustics, according\nto Mr. Foster, whose company markets\nthe system nationwide. Current customers include MIT, which is using the\nsystem as part of an effort to develop\nbinaural hearing aids, and Bellcore, which\nis studying ways to improve teleconferencing systems .\nCRE has developed a single-source\nsystem called the Microtron for basic\naudio research, and an advanced prototype system with four times the Convolvotron\'s throughput. This system is\ncapable of over one billion multiplyaccumulate operations per second. Under\ncontract to NASA, the company is designing a workstation-level software\npackage for the Convolvotron that will\nallow researchers to quickly devise and\nrun experiments involving human subjects.\n\nVR On A PC\nCurrent head-mounted VR systems\nare too expensive for widespread use;\nthey rely on customized graphics workstations and can cost over $200 ,000\neach . Autodesk Inc., a major supplier of\ncomputer-aided design software, is developing a PC-based virtual reality software package called Cyberspace that\n\nshould dramatically slash the cost of\ncreating artificial worlds. Expected on\nthe market next year, Cyberspace will\nbe a generic program adaptable to almost\nany type of graphics or design work.\n"Our goal is to produce a simulation\nkernel that will be small and fast and run\nunder a variety of ope rating systems :\nsaid Chris Allis , public relations director\nfor the Cyberspace project. "We\'ll license it to third-party developers who\nwill then build customized applications."\n\nBring ing Mars Down To Earth\nMeanwhile, NASA is refining its pioneering VR machine for advanced applications such as space telerobotics\nand virtual solar system exploration. Dr.\nMcGreevy\'s team is developing a flightqualifiable system for possible use on\nspace station Freedom . Astronauts\naboard the orbiting facility may eventually use the Virtual Workstation to guide\nrobots repairing satellites in space. The\nastronaut would see what the robot sees\nand , by wearing a glove embedded with\nforce reflectors, wou ld feel the tightness\nof the robot\'s grip on a tool or spacecraft\npart.\nAnother project looks to bring the\nplanets and moons virtually down to\n\nEarth by recreating interactive digital\nmodels from pictorial data. "Using personal simulators , we could all participate in the exploration of the planets ,"\nsaid Dr. McGreevy. "It would democratize space exploration."\n\nFor further information about the\ntechnologies described in this\narticle, contact:\nLaurance Milov\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nAmes Research Center\nMail Code 223-3\nMoffett Field, CA 94035\nAnn Lasko\nVPL Research Inc.\n656 Bair Island Road\nSuite 304\nRedwood City, CA 94063\nScott Foster\nCrystal River Engineering Inc.\n12350 Wards Ferry Road\nGroveland, CA 95321\nChris Allis\nAutodesk Inc.\n2320 Marinship Way\nSausalito, CA 94965\n\nANNOUNCING: A TOUGB FORMABLE\nINSULATION TBAT CAN GO TO BELL ...\nPYROPEL1&: a new concept\nin structural insulation.\nPyropel is a new lightweight, high temperature, non-woven insulation material that can\nbe used in flat sheets or formed into a variety\nof shapes.

The\n\nAnalog Signal\n\ncost of the COfTlXlI1ents is less than $150.00\n(1988 prices), and the circuit can be installed without any permanent change to\nthe SWR meter. The additional capability\nprovided by the auto-range circuit makes\nthe SWR meter an ideal instrument for use\nin applications involving computercontrolled monitoring of power when large\nchanges in signal level are expected.\nWhen the automatic rang~hanging circuit is engaged, the modified SWR meter\naccomplishes all changing of ranges internally, independently of any external con-\n\ntroller. In most applications, a computer will\nbe used to log data, and data are transferred through the recorder output lines of\nthe SWR meter with appropriate buffering.\nThe input signal power is derived from the\nanalog meter circuitry, which, although it\ndisplays only 10 dB, actually has a range of\n13 dB. These extra 3 dB are used as headroom during a range-changing operation.\nThe analog-to-digital conversion is not performed in the SWR meter and must be effected by the controller.

The self-alignment concept was developed for silicide\nSchottky-barrier diodes in which platinum\nsilicide or iridium silicide Schottky-contacts\nprovide cutoff wavelengths of about 6 or 10\nflm, respectively.\nSilicide diodes have been built into focal\nplane arrays of 512 by 512 elements for infrared imaging. Usually, each diode element must be surrounded and overlapped\nby an n-type guard ring to disperse electricfield lines at the edge of the silicide layer in\norder to suppress the leakage current.\nSelf-alignment eliminates the need for\nmuch of the overlap between the guard\nring and the silicide contact. Ordinarily, an\noverlap of 2 ~ is necessary to allow for\nmisalignment of the ring mask and lateral\ndiffusion and straggling of dopant ions during the fabrication of the guard rings. In a\ndiode of 30 by 48 flm, for example, the\noverlap reduces the effective area by\nabout 20 percent. Inasmuch as the overlap\narea is not sensitive to infrared, the result is\na significant loss of output.\nTo begin the fabrication of a self-aligned\narray of diodes, a layer of silicon dioxide\ndoped with phosphorus would be deposited on a silicon substrate. This layer would\nbe etched to form a grid defining the elements of the array (see figure). The phosphorus in the grid would be diffused into the\nsilicon to form a grid of n-type guard rings.\nThus, self-alignment would make fabrication simpler by eliminating the masking\n\nstep for diffusion of the n-type guard ring.\nFinally, the desired metal would be deposited on the exposed silicon surface, and\nthe silicide layer would be formed by annealing. The only overlap of a guard ring\nwith the silicide layer of a cell would be that\ncaused by sideways diffusion of the phosphorus, which can be kept quite low by adjusting the time and temperature of the diffusion process.\n\nThis work was done by True-Lon Un of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, For further information, Orc/e 138\non the TSP Request Card.\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.

The starting circuit operates only during such intervals of\nhigh demand for current and has little effect\nat any other time.\nAn EPLD is an integrated circuit in which\ncells erasable by ultraviolet radiation are\nused to configure elements that perform\nlogical functions. Typically, an EPLD is intended to operate from a regulated 5-Vdc\npower supply, drawing about 3 mA when at\n20\n\nfull power with a slow (100 kHz) clock. This\nlow power is an advantage where power\nmust be supplied by a battery.\nBecause of certain voltage-dependent\ndesign features in the portion of the EPLD\ncircuitry that affects the current drawn in\nthe operating mode, the EPLD draws a relatively high current when the supply voltage, Vee, is first turned on. This current\nrises to a peak of about 40 mA as Vee rises\nto 3 V. As Vee goes higher, the current\nabruptly drops to the full operating level. If\nVee subsequently falls below 2.5 V, the\n\ndevice abruptly returns to the high-current\nmode (see Figure 1).\nThe 4G-mA peak starting current is more\nthan can be supplied by a typical voltage\nregulator designed for operation with lowpower circuitry. Therefore, if no provision\nwere made to bypass the voltage regulator\nduring startup, the EPLD would continue to\ndraw the maximum current that the regulator could supply, and Vee could not be\nmade to reach or exceed 3 V.\nThe starting circuit (see Figure 2) performs the needed bypass, acting as a current-dependent shunt that connects the\nbattery or other source of power more\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\nMATLABHI\nHigh-Performance\nNumeric Computation\nand Data Analysis\n\n"MATLAB\nis the\nundisputed\nchoice for\ncomputationintensive\nengineering\nwork."\n\nM\n\nATLAB has rapidly become an\nindustry standard for engineering and scientific research.

For OCO imagers there are three\nmain sources of dark current: (1) thermal\ngeneration and diffusion in the neutral bulk,\n(2) thermal generation in the depletion region,\nand (3) thermal generation due to surface\nstates at the Si/Si0 2 interface. Of these\nsources, the contribution from the surface\nstates is the dominant factor for muttiphase\nOCO\'s. Oark<:urrent generation at this interface depends on two factors: (1) the density\nof interface states, and (2) the density of free\ncarriers (holes or electrons) that populate the\ninterface.\nThree\xc2\xb7Pha \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 MPP/CCD\n\nImplant\n\n22\n\nElectrons that thermally "hop" from the\nvalence band to an interface state (s0metimes referred to as a midoand state) and to\nthe conduction band produce a dark<:urrent\nelectron-hole pair. The presence of free carriers will fill the interface states, inhibiting the\nhcpping conduction process and in tum substantially reducing dark current to the bulk\ndark level.\nConventional OCO q:)eration depletes the\nsignal channel and interface of free carriers,\nmaximizing dark<:urrent generation. Under\ndepleted conditions, dark current is determined by the quality of the SilSi0 2 interface\nor the density of mictland states, which varies\nwidely among OCO manufacturers.\nOlannel inversion is easily promoted for a\nceo by biasing the array clocks sufficiently\nFigure 1. The MPP\xc2\xb7\nCCO is made with\npositive doping (in this\ncase, boron) implants\nthat define barrier\nphases . When all\nphases are biased together into inversion,\ndark current is reduced. and the potential of the charge-collecting wells is the difference between the\npotentials of the barrier\nand collection phases.\n\n"pin" the surface potential beneath each\nphase to substrate potential (hence the name\nmuttiilinnediXlase). Biasing the array clocks\nin this manner causes holes from the p +\nchannel stops to migrate and populate the\nSilSi0 2 interface, eliminating surface darkcurrent generation. Unfortunately when conventional OCO\'s are inverted, the full well\ncapacity of the sensor is destrOfed because\nthe potential wells \'Nithin a pixel all assume\nthe same level. This condition results in\nsevere blooming up and down the signalcarrying channel because there is no preferential potential well for charge to collect. To\ncircumvent this difficuny, in MPP OCO technology, a weak implant is employed beneath\none or more phases during the fabrication of\nthe sensor. The extra dopant creates a potential difference between phases, allowing\ncharge to accumulate in collecting sites\nwhen biased into inversion (see Rgure 1).\nOther advantages of the MPP OCO Include COf\'TlJIete elimination of residual image\neffects during integration and readout, low\npixel nonuniformity, and an increase in quantum efficiency in the near infrared because\nhigher operating temperatures can be used.\n.AJso, MPP OCO\'s are more tolerant to ionizing radiation environments. For example,\nFigure 2 shows dark levels measured under\ninverted and non inverted conditions before\nand after the sensor was exposed to 20 kilorads of eo.ro (a source of 1.2-MeV gamma\nrays).

When operating in the receiving mode, each antenna\nacts as part of the detector for one picture\nelement in a millimeter- or submillimeterwavelength imaging radar system (see\nFigure 1). A millimeter-wave imaging\nsystem can be used to view objects\nthrough fog, smoke, or smog with resolution intermediate between that of microwave and visible-light imaging systems.\nEach element of the array includes a\nreflecting pyramidal horn and a dipole\nantenna suspended on a membrane in the\nhorn (see Figure 2). The pyramidal holes\nfor the horns are made by anisotropic etching along the <111> crystal planes of the\nfront and back silicon substrates. The reflecting surfaces are made by depositing\ngold or other suitable metal on the sides of\nthe pyramidal holes.\nThe membrane is a layer of silicon nitride or other suitable material that is trans-\n\nparent at the millimeter or submillimeter\nwavelength of interest. About 1 ~ thick, it\nis made by depositing the membrane material on the back side of the front silicon\nsubstrate before etching the horns. Portions of the membrane layer between the\npyramidal cavities and around the edges of\nthe front substrate are etched away to\nmake room for detecting and processing\nelectronic circuitry.\nThe antennas are either mounted or fabricated lithographically on the back side of\nthe membrane. Thus, the antennas can radiate as though they were suspended in\nfree space within the horns, unencumbered by auxiliary supporting structures.\nElectrical contact to the antennas and processing electronics is made via bonding\npads around the edge of the back side of\nthe front substrate.

The OEIC (see figure) is\npotentially useful in any system in which\ndigital data must be transmitted serially at\nhigh rates, then decoded into and used in\nparallel format at the destination. Examples of applications include the transmission and decoding of control signals to\nphase shifters in phased-array antennas\nand also the communication of data between computers and peripheral equipment in local-area networks.\nAll of the electronic functions of the\nOEIC are performed by components that\nare monolithically integrated on a GaAs\nsubstrate. The input optical fiber, which has\na core of 50 IffT1 in diameter, is mounted in\na ceramic V-groove block. The end of the\nfiber is beveled to couple the signal into a\nphotodetector, which converts the input\noptical signal into an electrical Signal of\nidentical format. This signal is fed to a\nthree-stage amplifier.\nThe input signal is in the form of sequential 1&bit words. The amplified input Signal\nis fed to a 1:16 demultiplexer (decoder),\nwhich assigns parts of the stream of data\nto each of the 16 parallel output channels\naccording to a code contained in the input\nsignal.\nThe OEIC contains a total of 2,000 transistors. It is sealed in a package 0.5 in.\n(12.7 mm) wide and 1 in. (25.4 mm) long. It\nconsumes 150 mW of power. In comparison with similar demultiplexers made byassembling hybrid or discrete components,\nthis unit has about one-fifth the size, onetenth the power consumption, and t\'hoflfths\nthe weight. In addition, the new unit can be\nintegrated monolithically with other GaAs\ndevices.\nThis INOrk was done by Kul B.

The mcx:lified device is a photovoltaicdriven multiple-quantum-well light modulator similar to the one described previously, but with added features to increase its\nsensitivity and its utility as a spatial light\nmcx:lulator.\nAs shown in Figure 1, antireflection\ncoating is applied to the front surface, and\na reflective metal layer, to the back surface. These layers provide for two passes\nof the read signal (the signal to be mcx:lulated), thus doubling the effective modulation depth. Alternatively, the device could\nbe fabricated into an etalon structure for\nmultiple passes ofthe read signal and a further increase in the modulation depth.\nAlso, as shown in Figure 1, grooves could\nbe etched to divide the device into an array\nof picture elements. Each element could\nbe made in the desired size (e.g., 10 IffTl\nsquare) for use in a large-array spatial light\nmodulator.\nThe modified device exploits the quantum well equivalant of the Moss-Burnstein\nshift, denoted by llE in Figure 2. This is a\nshift in the energy of the quantum-well absorption edge caused by the filling of twodimensional quantum states in the multiple\nquantum wells, and which results in high\nmodulation sensitivity in the quantum\nwells. This shift is given by\nllE = h2n/nm*\nwhere h is Planck\'s constant, ns is the number of occupied two-dimensional quantum\nstates per unit area,and m * is the effective\nelectron mass in the InAs or InGaAs. The\nterm ns is related to the electric field, F \' at\ns\nthe boundaries of the quantum well through\nGauss\'s law; namely, Fs = en/f., where e\nis the electrical charge and f. is the electrical permittivity of the material.\nThe interleaved negatively-doped GaAs\nlayers provide the electrons and the spacecharge barriers that separate the electron/hole pairs generated by the writing\n(modulating) light beam of photon energy\ngreater than the semiconductor energyband gap (E ) of GaAs for strong absorption (or greafer than the quantum well absorption edge for weaker absorption). The\nphoto holes drift to the quantum wells and\nrecombine there with electrons, thereby\ndepleting ns by an amount lln s that\ndepends on the flux of photons.

It can accommodate a variety\nof PCM formats (e.g., different bit rates)\nand modes of display.\nThe TOPius system (see figure) includes\na custom-built set of four circuit cards that\nplug into any personal computer compatible with the Industry Standard Architecture\n(ISA) bus. Its extensive operating-system\nsoftware provides for "pop<lown windows"\nto enable the user to edit, examine, and display telemetry data in various forms, including binary, hexadecimal, decimal, and\nengineering units; bar charts; and elapsedtime and XY formats. This software is written in \'C\', is very user-friendly, and enables\nanyone who has basic knowledgeoftelemetry to use the system without an instruction manual.\nThe TOPius system can handle words of\nany size from 4 to 16 bits, and up to 8,192\nwords in a major frame. The maximum\ndata rate is now 3.3 Mbits per second, and\na new prototype board to handle 5.5 Mbits\nper second has been built.\nThe TDPlus system contains 32 digitalto-analog converters (OAC\'s), two 16-bit\nparallel output ports, a cathode-ray-tube\n(CRT) display, a keyboard, a floppy-<1isk\ndrive, and the software to generate, edit,\n\nand record PCM telemetry data. Optionally,\na PCM bit synchronizer, a PCM simulator, a\nreal time display, and a printer can be in\xc2\xb7\ncluded to make the TO Plus a stand-alone\nPCM decommutator and data-reduction\nsystem.\nThe memory and input/output (1/0) of the\nTOPius are allocated such that there is no\nconflict with existing memory and 1/0 of\nstandard ISA personal computers. The\nTOPius system has its own bus in addition\nto the computer bus. This bus enables the\ndistribution of incoming data to the set of\nTOPius circuit cards.\nThe frame-synchronizing card is the first\ncard in the TOPlus system. It uses verylarge-scale-integ ration (VLSI) and erasable\nprogrammable logic devices (EPLO\'s) to\ngenerate all synchronization signals (Le.,\nbit clock, frame clock, and subframe\nclock). It also provides the addresses for\nthe parallel telemetry (TM) data matrix 10cated on the card described next.\nThe TM-memory/parallel-port card has\ntwo major functions: it writes all incoming\ndata to a dual-port, eight-kiloword randomaccess-memory (RAM) section and provides tagged data to be sent to either of the\ntwo 16-bit parallel ports or 32 digital-to-analog converters. If the data are designated\nfor display, access to them is gained by the\ncomputer through the dual-port RAM. If the\n\nr - - - - - - - "Fr;m;;:d I\nI\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nincoming data are tagged to be sent to\neither of the parallel ports, they are picked\nfrom the stream of incoming data and sent\nto the selected port in real time for further\nreduction by the user. If the incoming data\nare tagged to be sent to one of the 32\nOAC\'s, the data, along with the selected\nOAC address, is sent to the card described\nnext.\nThe OACcontrolier card decodes the\nOAC addresses for tagged TM data and\ncomputer-generated calibration points.\nThese selected data are sent to the OAC\ncard (described below) to be converted into an analog Signal. The OAC\'s can have\neither &bit or 12-bit resolution.\nThe OAC card contains 32 voltagemode digital-to-analog converters with output-buffer amplifiers to provide drive to external recording devices. Several types of\nOAC\'s are compatible with the OAC controller. These range from a unipolar output\nto a selectable bipolar output. All OAC\'s\nare monotonic and use no external trim. All\noutput amplifiers are internally compensated to provide stable operation over a\nwide range of loads.\nThis work was done by David Massey\nand Brian Corbin of Goddard Space\nAight Center.

The probe is\nmanipulated with conventional integratedcircuit-wafer-probing equipment and is\noperated without any special preparation\nof the integrated circuits.\nThe tip of the probe is a small electrooptical crystal that serves as a proximity\nelectric\xc2\xb7field sensor. Typically, it is used to\nmeasure the fringing or guided electric\nfield between, say, two parallel conductor\nlines to determine the signal potential between them. The tip is brought close to (but\nnot touching) the conductors (see figure)\nso that the fringing field can induce\nchanges in the index of refraction of the\nelectro-optical material. These changes\nmodulate a pulsed laser beam reflected\nfrom the tip. The modulation, proportional\nto the electric field, is displayed on a sampling oscilloscope. The temporal resolution\nof this technique is determined by the duration of the pulses (typically, 80 fs), which act\nas the sampling-gate signals for the oscilloscope.\nThe electro-optical material of the tip is\nchosen according to the orientation of the\nelectric field to be measured.

Because\na transverse field is ordinarily measured\nwhen the axis of the probe is aimed between two parallel conductors, it is usually\nnecessary in this case to use a mirror coat\non the tip to reflect the laser beam. Because a longitudinal field is ordinarily\nmeasured when the axis of the probe is\naimed at a conductor, the beam can be reflected from the conductor, and a mirror\ncoat is not needed.\nThe transverse version of the probe typically gives a measurement of voltage only\nover a small range of positions between\ntwo conductors. The longitudinal version,\non the other hand, can sense the electric\nfield over a range of positions across a conductor and, therefore, gives a measure of\nsignal voltage more quickly and accurately.\nThe longitudinal version gives a more accurate measure of a broadband signal voltage.\nThis work was done by K.

The frequency-tracking-error detector is part of a system of\nelectronic equipment used to measure vibrations in bearings in rotating machinery.\nIn this system, measurements of the\nspeed of rotation of a shaft and estimates\nof the ratio between the speed of rotation\nof a bearing cage and the speed of rotation\nof the shaft that turns in the bearing are\nused to set fo at a harmonic of the frequency of rotation of the bearing cage. The frequency-tracking-error detector is needed\nbecause the ratio between the speeds is\nnot constant, and yet it is necessary to\nkeep the frequency-tracking error as close\nto zero as possible to maximize the accuracy and reliability of measurements.\nThe output of the frequency-tracking error\ndetector is used as an error signal to tune fo\nmanually or automatically to the desired\nbearing-cage harmonic. In effect, it gives a\ncontino us measurement of the ratio between the speeds.\nA signal from a bearing sensor is amplified and passed through the tracking bandpass filter in question (see figure). The output\nof the filter is passed through a zero-cross-\n\ning detector.

The output of the subsystem is a binary signal at the frequency\nof rotation of the shaft. The subsystem is\npart of an assembly of electronic equipment that measures vibrations in rotating\nmachinery. Some of the other equipment is\ndescribed in the two preceding articles and\nthe following article. The other equipment\nuses the binary shaft-speed signal as a\nphase and frequency reference in the\nanalysis of other vibration signals.\nThe accelerometer is mounted in such a\nway as to be sensitive to vibrations of the\nshaft perpendicular to its axis. The output\nof the accelerometer includes noise and\ncomponents of vibration at frequencies\nhigher than the rotational frequency of the\nshaft. The shaft-rotation-detector subsystem extracts the fundamental-frequency\ncomponent of the vibration of the shaft\n(which is presumed to be synchronized\nwith the rotation of the shaft) by acting as a\ntracking low-pass filter, the cutoff frequency of which is determined iteratively by the\nmeasurement itself.\nAs shown in the figure, the output of the\naccelerometer is processed through a zero-\n\nOutpu1 :\n\nSha ft\xc2\xb7Rotation\nSignal\n\nClock Signal\n50 MHz\n\ncrossing detector into a delay logic circuit,\nwhich recognizes a zero crossing only\nwhen it appears to be stable for the equivalent of 1/160fthe current measured period.\nFor this purpose, the period is the period of\nthe binary output of the delay logic circuit,\nas measured by a counter. The measured\nperiod, divided by 16, is loaded into a preset\ncounter to generate the required delay. The\nbinary output of the delay logic circuit is\ntaken to be the shaft-rotation reference\nsignal.\nThe basic measurement performed by the\nsubsystem - the period corresponding to\nthe rotation of the shaft - is made with a\nprecision of 28 bits. To suppress random\nerrors yet still be able to track changes in\nspeed, the measurements of the 16 most\nrecent periods are averaged exponentially.\nThe shaft-rotation-detector subsystem\n\nThe Shaft- Rotation\nDetector finds a fu ndamental -frequency\ncomponent of lateral\nvibration of a rotati ng\nshaft in the output\nof an accelerometer\nmounted on the housing of a bearing that\nsupports the shaft.

Its\nprecision, response time, frequency range,\nand resolution can all be extended, inasmuch as they are all determined by parameters of the digital circuits within it.\nThis work was done by Richard L.

The frequency synthesizer is part of an assembly of electronic\nequipment used to measure vibrations in\nbearings in rotating machinery.

The frequency synthesizer was designed to meet the requirements for tracking the narrow-band cagerotation and ball-pass components of\nvibrations, as discussed in the first two articles, "Frequency-Tracking Error Detector" (MFS-29538) and " Ball-Pass CageModulation Detector" (MF&29539).\nThe digital frequency synthesizer uses\nbinary logarithm and antilogarithm lookup\ntables in programmable read-only memories (PROM\'s) to compute filter-control frequencies from 20-bit binary measurements of the period of rotation (T), the ratio\nbetween the speed of rotation of the cage\nand the speed of rotation of the shaft (CSR),\nand the number of balls (N) in the bearing to\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1000\n\nThe Digital Freq uency Synthesizer responds rapidly, computing and\ngenerating filter-control signals from input\nmeasurements.\n\nControl Signal for Gage Fil ter:\n\nFreq uency = 100 x CSRfT\n\nbe analyzed.

The update rate, the precision of the output frequency, and the dynamic range are limited\nonly by the selected clock frequencies and\n33\n\nby the number of bits used to process the\ninput variables.

This condition is equivalent to the condition that no direction in the\nstate space at any time is orthogonal to all\nthe past observations. It is also shown to be\nequivalent to the reachability of a certain\npair of matrices, related to the covariance\nfunction 01 the observations process. The\nnotion of estimability is independent of that\nof observability in the sense that one does\nnot imply the other.\nWhen a system is not estimable, the corresponding Kalman filter can be reduced to\nabNer-order estimator of the state process.\nA Iinear-state-space system driven by white\nnoise is stlO\'M1 to be a minimal-order realization of its output process if and only if it Is\nobservable and estimable. These results\napply to time-variant and time-invariant\nlinear systems in discrete and continuous\ntime. In the stationary case, the estimability\ncondition leads directly to conditions for\nminimality of the Kalman filter.\nA linear system is said to be regulable If,\nfor any nonzero Initial condition, the quadratic cost in applying optimal control is\nstrictly smaller than the cost when no control is applied. This means that when a system is not regulable, the feedback signal\nmay be eliminated for some nonzero initial\ncondition without increasing the cost. Necessary and sufficient conditions for regulability are obtained for time-variant and\ntime\xc2\xb7invariant systems. The regulability\ncondition is the same as the condition for\nthe complete dependence of the regulation problem, which in turn has been\nshown previously to be equivalent to the irreducibility of the optimal linear quadratic\nregulator.\nIt is shoNn that the estimability condition\nand the regulabllity condition, which involve the Lyapunov equation and the timereversed Lyapunov equation, respectively,\nare Similar, modulo time reversal. Such\nsimilarity, which has also been shown to\nexist between the Riccati equations associated with the estimation and the regulation problems, has been termed "duality"\nin the literature. The duality between the\nestimabllity and the regulabllity properties\nis then shown to be consistent with the one\nbetween the Lyapunov and the Rlccati\nequations corresponding to the estimation\nand the regulation problems. Next, by use\nof this duality, the regulability condition is\nobtained from the estimability condition.\nThis work was done by Yoram Baram of\nArne.

The\nfacility is used to develop heat-flux gauges\nfor turbine blades and to test materials for\ndurability under rapidly changing temperatures.\nThe facility includes a commercial arclamp system, a heat exchanger, and a\nhigh-speed three-axis positioning system.\nMicrocomputers in the lamp system and\nthe positioning system control their functions. The main computer commands the\nmicrocomputers and controls the overall\ntesting and acquisition of data. The lamp\nsystem focuses thermal radiation from an\narc onto a 1-by-4-cm test area about 4 cm\naway. The heat exchanger cools the water\ncirculated through the lamp. The positioning system is programmed to immerse a\nheat-flux gauge in liquid nitrogen at the\nstart of a test, then place the gauge in the\ntest area where the lamp heats it (see figure), and finally return the gauge to the liquid nitrogen.\nThroughout the test, a main computer\ngathers data from the gauge under test,\nfrom thermocouples on the gauge, and\nfrom a current sensor in the lamp system.\nIn a representative test, the lamp current is\ninitially 30 A. When the test gauge has\nbeen in position in the test area for 0.3 s,\nthe current is suddenly increased to 400 A\nThe increase in radiant heat increases the\nheat-flux density to about 5.2 MW/m 2, 0.4 s\nlater. This corresponds to a transient\nheating rate of 12.6 MW/m2s , typical of\nrates that can occur in some kinds of turbomachinery.\n\nTwo types of heat-flux gauges were\nused to evaluate the facility. Commercial\nwater-cooled Gardon gauges yielded\nhighly correlated data, suggesting that the\ninstrument makes repeatable measurements as the current in the arc lamp is increased from 30 to 400 A. Gardon gauges\nare limited to temperatures between 280\nand 360 K.\nFor use over the full temperature range\nof the facility, durable miniature plug-type\ngauges were fabricated from a nickel-base\nalloy. Data from the new gauges generally\nagree with those from the Gardon gauges\nduring the initial transient and into the\n\nsteady-state period of heating until about\n2.6 s into the test. After that, the data from\nthe two types differ by more than 20 percent, probably because of heat leaks and\nbecause data on the temperature<lependent specific heat and thermal conductMty of the nickel alloy are inaccurate.\nThis work was done by Curt H. Uebert\nand Donald H. Weikle of lewis Research\nCenter. Further information may be found\nin NASA TM-101428 [N89-14418].

Cooling water\nflows through the lamp to the heat exchanger.\n\nMeasuring Irradiance Over Large Areas\nThe map of temperature on a thin reradiating sheet yields data on the thermal irradiance.\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA relatively simple experimental technique yields data that can be processed,\nvia a straightforward mathematical model,\ninto a map of the thermal irradiance over a\nlarge area. The technique can be used to\n42\n\nobtain rapid measurements of the incidentflux distribution over a broad spectral\nrange at specific locations relative to such\nheat sources as infrared heat lamps or\nlasers. The technique was originally de-\n\nveloped to verify efficiently the uniformity\nof irradiance that would be produced by a\ncomplex array of quartz-tube heat lamps\nand reflector elements over a large spacecraft solar panel during thermal vacuumNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\nchamber tests.\nA thin, opaque sheet of material having\nknown solar absorptance and emittance is\nplaced at the distance and orientation relative to the heat sources where the irradiance is to be evaluated. The heat sources\nare turned on, and the sheet is allowed to\ncome to thermal equilibrium with the environment (which could be a suitable laboratory room or an evacuated chamber). An\nimaging infrared radiometer is used to map\nthe temperature distribution on the sheet\n(see figure).\nThe sheet is extremely thin and has a\nvery low thermal conductivity, so that the\nlateral diffusion of heat within it is negligible. The steady-state energy balance at\nany point on the sheet can therefore be\ndescribed by a mathematical model that\nincludes only the radiative and convective\nheat losses, plus absorbed irradiance. Only such parameters as the solar absorptance and emittance of the sheet, the\ntemperatures of the sheet and the environment, and the convective film coefficients\n(if air is present) are required for a complete solution. The equation can be\nmanipulated to solve directly for the local\nirradiance as a function of the local\nmeasured sheet temperature and the\nother parameters.\nThe equation is valid provided that the\nfollOWing additional conditions are satisfied:\n1. The sheet is opaque and diffuse and has\nhigh emittance over a broad spectral\nrange.\n\n2. The heat sources are far enough away\nfrom the sheet that they do not significantly block the total view to the surroundings.\n3. In air, the test should be conducted under\n\nThe Imaging Infrared\nRadio m eter makes a\ntemperature map of\nthe sheet.

Local variations in convective film coefficients are small.\n5. Local variations in radiative properties of\nthe sheet (solar absorptance, emmance,\ndiffuseness, and the like) are negligible.\n6. The facility in which the test is performed\nis large w~h respect to the sheet.\n7. The chamber in which the test is performed is at a known, uniform temperature. In air, it is convenient (but not necessary) to assume the chamber is at the\nambient air temperature.\nThe mathematical model and radiometric flux-density mapping technique have\nbeen validated by comparison with calorimetrically obtained irradiance measurements for a complex heat\xc2\xb7source geometry. The flux level was predicted with an\naccuracy of 15 percent or better, and the\nshape of the two-dimensional irradiance\ndistribution matched the measured profile\n\nvery closely. Modern commercial imaging\ninfrared radiometers detect temperature\ndifferences sufficiently small to resolve irradiance differences of less than 1 percent, using this method.The technique can\nprovide useful data on irradiance distribution at levels up to approximately 6 kW/m 2\nin near real time over very large areas. It is\nespecially useful in cases where accurate\nmathematical modeling is not practical because of the geometric complexity of the\nheat sources or of the targets, or where\nheat-source power outputs are not accurately known, or vary with time. The quick\nresponse also facilitates rapid adjustments\nto the heat-source geometry to obtain\ndesired flux patterns.\nThis Work was done by Stuart D. Glazer\nand Georg Siebes of Caltech for NASA\'s\nJet Propulsion laboratory.

The modified source is\nused with the 88-in. Cyclotron at the University of California at Berkeley to simulate\nheavy-ion cosmic rays in studies of the effects of these rays on solid-state electronic\ncircuits. The addition of the capability to\nproduce and separate krypton ions at kinetic energies of 150 to 400 MeV is necessary for simulation of the worst-case ions\nthat occur in outer space.\nAn electron cyclotron resonance (ECR)\nsource can be tuned to emit a beam containing ions of several different species simultaneously, provided that each species\nhas a similar ratio of atomic mass (A) to\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\ncharge (0). However, the A/O ratios of the\nspecies must differ sufficiently to enable\nthe separation of the species by use of the\nslight differences between their cyclotron\nfrequencies. The advantage of such a mul-\n\ntip Ie-species ion source is that it takes only\na few minutes to retune the cyclotron from\none species to another.\nPreviously, The ERC source had been\nused to provide 4oAr+ 8, 2oNe+ 4, and\n15f-.1 +3. The NO ratios of these ions differ\nenough that they can be separated by\ntuning (see table).

The reason is that the\nresonant frequency for 8Ot<r + 16 is only\n1.486 kHz away from that of 40Ar +8, and\nwell within the resonance width of the\ncyclotron (3 kHz, full width at half maximum).\nThis difficulty is surmounted by use of\n\nthe single ion isotope 86Kr + 17, the tuning\npoint of which differs by 163.250 kHz. Tests\nhave confirmed that the EGR source can\nproduce all four ion species simultaneously when its magnetic field is tuned to an intermediate AlO value of 5.025. The source\nhas performed flawlessly with the new\nfour-ion mixture, with changeovers to and\nfrom the krypton ion in minutes. There was\nfound to be no detectable krypton contamination that would affect the results of\n\nexperiments with ions of lower atomic\nnumbers and lower degrees of ionization.\nThis new beam capabil ity saves many\nhours of expensive tuning time and greatly\nfacilitates the scheduling and use of the ion\nsource.\nThis work was done by George A. Soli\nand Donald K. Nichols of Caltech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. For\nfurther information, Circle 28 on the TSP\nRequest Card. NPO-17766\n\n~~ Silicon Detectors for Helium Liquid and Vapor\nLiquid cools more than vapor does, resulting in greater electrical resistance .\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nSimple electrical-resistance devices\nmade of silicon indicate whether helium liquid or helium vapor is present. Although the\ndevices were designed primarily for use in\nouter space, they have been tested and\nfound to operate in normal Earth gravity.\nSuch helium-liquidlvapor detectors can be\nincorporated into ducts or containers of\nlaboratory equipment, for example, and\nused to infer locations of liquidlvapor interfaces in order to measure quantities of liquid and vapor or to control refill operations.\nThe devices are 0.2S-mm cubes of silicon doped with antimony and boron.\nOhmic contacts are formed on opposite\nfaces by implantation of arsenic at 150 keV\nand coating with gOld. One gold face of\neach cube is soldered or bonded with silver\nepoxy to a gold-plated, 0.05-mm.oiameter\n304 stainless-steel wire that serves as a\nsupport and as a common electrical conductor for all the devices in a string of them\n(see figure). The other face of each cube is\nsoldered or silver epoxied to a O\n.05-mm.oiameter manganin wire. The cubes, wires,\nand solder or epoxy lumps are made small\nto make their heat capacities low to promote rapid thermal response.\nThe electrical resistance of each device\ndepends strongly on its temperature. A\nsmall, fixed electrical current is passed\nthrough each device, heating it above the\ntemperature ofthe surrounding helium and\ndecreasing its resistance. Because the liquid helium cools the device more than\ndoes helium vapor at the same temperature, the device has a higher resistance in\nliquid than in vapor. Therefore, the voltage\nacross the device is higher in the presence\nof liquid, and this voltage is measured to\ndetermine whether liquid or vapor is present.\nThe level of doping is selected so that\nthe "liquid" reading is ~ Vand the "vapor"\n\nStainless-Steel Strip Support\nfor Stainless-Steel Wire\nStainless-Steel Wire\n(Common Electrical Lead)\n\nVapor\nHelium\n\nliquid\nHelium\n\nDETAIL A\n\nSilicon Cubes are supported by stainless-steel wires and strips. The voltage across each\n\ncube at a fixed current indicates whether it is immersed in helium liquid or vapor.\n\nreading is <0.5 V over a wide range of current. Each device is operated at a power\n(typically ~0 . 3 mW) sufficient to boil away\nany liquid-helium film that remains on the\ndevice when it is immersed in vapor, but\nnot so large a power as to cause boiling\nwhen the device is immersed in the bulk liquid. The doping level can be optimized for\noperation at a specified temperature. However, the operating characteristics of a\ntypical device are nearly independent of its\noperating temperature over a relatively\nwide (for cryogenic practice) temperature\n\n~~ Isothermal Calorimeter\nA pressure-feedback signal indicates the rate of heating.\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nAn improved isothermal calorimeter\nmeasures the rate of heating in an object\n44\n\nManganln Wire.\n(Sensing Lead)\n\nunder test. It is called "isothermal " because the chamber that holds the object\n\nrange, e.g., < 1.4 K to > 4.2 K.\nThe detectors respond rapidly to changes in the surrounding medium. For example,\nin one set of tests in which thick superfluid\nhelium films were boiled off the detectors,\nthe transitions from "liquid" signals (rv1.8\nV) to "vapor" signals (rv 0.3 V) upon completion of boiloff took ~ 5 ms.\nThis work was done by M. J. Di Pirro and\nA. T. Serlemitsos of Goddard Space\nAight Center.

Unlike in other types of calorimeters, the rate\nof heating is, therefore, not measured in\nterms of the rate of increase of temperaNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\nture. Instead, it is measured in terms of the\nrate of boiling of a liquid.\nAs shown schematically in the figure,\nthe calorimeter includes an insulated inner\ntest chamber and an outer chamber, both\npartially filled with the liquid, which is usually trichloromonofluoromethane (CCI 3 F).\nThe object is immersed in the liquid in the\ninner chamber. A small hole in the bottom\nof the inner chamber allows the liquid to\nflow between the two chambers. The liquid\nin both chambers is kept at a low boil by\nheaters so that both liquids remain at or\nnear the boiling temperature, and the\nspace above the liquid in both chambers is\nfilled with vapor. A condenser limits the\nheight of the vapor space in the outer\nchamber.\nA differential-pressure gauge at the top\nof the inner chamber measures the difference between the vapor pressures in\nthe two chambers. A control circuit responds to the differential-pressure signal\nby applying a control voltage to a servovalve at the top of the inner chamber\nnear the gauge. The control circuit adjusts\nthe opening of the valve to maintain the\nvapor pressure in the inner chamber 0.1 psi\n(0.7 kPa) above that in the outer chamber.\nWhen the item under test generates\nheat, the rate of boiling and the pressure in\nthe inner chamber increase.

The system is sensitive to\nacoustical frequencies above the audible\nrange and is especially suited for monitoring leaks of high-pressure steam from\nboilers or chemical vapors from processing equipment. The system does not re. quire the placement of delicate equipment\nin the harsh environment to be monitored,\nand there need be no contact with the\nboiler or other unit being monitored.\nIn the latest (dual-beam) version of the\nsystem (see figure), light from a heliuml\nneon laser is split into two beams that are\naimed at a point on a retroreflective target.\nThe angle between the beams is set so that\nthe spatial period of the interference fringes formed by the intersecting beams\nequals the pitch of a moire pattem printed\non the target.

The\noutput of the photocell is amplified and\nsent to a spectrum analyzer.\nThe components are arranged so that\nthe laser beams pass by the equipment to\nbe monitored. Sound emanating from this\nequipment causes fluctuations in the index\nof refraction of the atmosphere. These\nfluctuations bend the laser beams back\nand forth slightly, causing the interference\nfringes to move across the moire pattern\n\nand modulate the reftected light. The spectrum of the modulation is analyzed in the\neffort to diagnose a leak.\nThe dual-beam version of the system is\nmore sensitive than the single-beam version. The single-beam version operates on\na similar principle, but the target is illuminated by only a single spot of light. If the\nsystem is to be used in the presence of\nsoot, an infrared laser may be preferred\nbecause of its greater penetrating power.\nThis work was done by Parthasarathy P.\n\nShakkottai and A Vijayaragavan AJwar of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion laboratory.

A\nsilicone ring seals the door to the chamber.\nA cooling coil extends through the door\nand holds a copper block, which supports\nthe specimen . Water at 23\xc2\xb0C flows\nthrough the cooling coil. A thermoelectric\nmodule on the block cools or heats the\nspecimen. A glass plate on the specimen\nholds it firmly against a thermocouple and\nthe thermoelectric module. A hole in the\nplate exposes the specimen to the plasma.\nThe thermocouple, spring~oaded so that\nit presses against the specimen, monitors\nits temperature. The thermocouple is connected through the door to an external\ncontrol circuit that adjusts the electric current in the thermoelectric module to maintain the specimen at a steady temperature.\nAfter a specimen has been loaded and\nsealed, the chamber is evacuated, then\nbackfilled with oxygen to a pressure of 600\nto 900 mtorr (80 to 120 Pa). The temperature and pressure in the chamber are\nallowed to stabilize for about 15 minutes.\nTo dissociate the oxygen into a plasma, the\nchamber is then excited by up to 100 W of\npower at a frequency of 13.56 MHz. The\nspecimen is exposed to the plasma for 30\nminutes at a temperature of 10, 45, or\n75 \xc2\xb0C. The specimen is then removed from\nthe chamber and examined.

Background nOise, or "dark noise;\' in well-out\xc2\xb7\ngassed MCP\'s that are free of hotspots is\ndue largely to ~ radiation emitted by isotopes of constituents of glass. Although\nconsiderable research has been performed\nduring the last several years and improved\nMCP\'s have been produced, background\nnoise is still present, even in the best com\xc2\xb7\nmercially available MCP\'s. Consequently,\nwork was undertaken to produce a glass\nthat has minimal intrinsic radioactivity and\ncan be used to manufacture MCP\'s with\nelectron gain, strip current, lifetime, and\noperating characteristics equivalent to\nthose of the best commercially available\nMCP\'s.\nThis objective was accomplished by the\nformulation of glasses that have the following range of compositions, in weight percent:\nSi0 2\nPbO\n\nCS20\n\n30 to 35\n50 to 57\n2 to 10\n\nI[MgO + CaO + SrO + BaO]\n\nr[AI 2 0 3 + Zr02 + Ti0 2 + Nb2 0 s]\n\n0 to 5\n0.1 to 1\n\nwhere the mole ratio of Si0 2 to PbO is 2.0\nto 2.4.\nThe ranges of proportions of Si02> PbO,\nand CSfJ were chosen on the basis of\nestimates of the influences of these components on the properties of glasses.\nThese ranges provide desired levels of\nglass-transition temperature, coefficient of\nthermal expansion, durability in acid, surface resistivity, softening point, and glass\nconductivity. These properties influence\nsuch factors as dimensional control and\nacceptable stress levels during production\nof the MCP, and attainment of appropriately high and stable strip currents for proper\noperation of the MCP. Alkaline earth\nelements, in the form of MgO and Cao, are\nincorporated to control forming viscosities\nand chemical durability.

However, this figure may\nalso include reSidual radioactivity from\nnon-MCP components in the test detector.\nReplacement of ceramic hardware, which\nis known to contain radioisotopes, is currently underway.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nOimethylethoxysllane (OMES) has been\nfound to rewaterproof tiles and composite\npanels internally without harming the\nmaterials that underlie them. OMES replaces hexamethyldlsilazane (HMOS) as\nthe postmission rewaterproofing agent for\nthe tiles of the thermal-protection system\non the Space Shuttle. Much of the original\nwaterproofing is lost during the rigors of\nlaunch and reentry. Potential terrestrial application may include composite materials\nin such structures as bridges and submarines.\nAlthough HMOS rewaterproofed effectively, it released reaction products that\nturned the silicone substrate Into a soft,\ngummy layer. Uke HMOS, OMES is an internal agent, injected into the tiles. Internal\nagents are more reliable than are extemal\nwaterproof coatings, which form only surface barriers that water can breach if the\ncoverage is not complete or the force drivNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\ning the water is great enough.\nOMES was selected from among 45 silicon-based candidate materials from 3\nmanufacturers. The materials were rated\non how well they rewaterproofed tiles and\non their chemical compatibility with the\nmaterials under the tiles. Two candidates\nshowed the greatest promise: OMES and\nisobutyttriethoxysilane (I BTES). OMES was\nchosen for further tests because it is more\nreadily available. OMES was then tested\nfor its ability to rewaterproof adequately\nwithout adversely affecting the substrate\nmaterials. Its performance with thermal\nblankets as well as with tiles was studied. It\nwas also subjected to environmental tests\n(humidity, rain, and wind, and heating in a\nvacuum).\nOM ES does not attack substrate materials as HMOS does because it does not give\noff harmful vap:lrs as it cures. HMOS reacts\nwith moisture in the tile to produce aml\'Tl(}\n\nnia, which breaks up supporting polymers\nin the substrate. The broken molecules\nbecome end-capped with trimethylsiloxy\ngroups that prevent them from rejoining.\nMoreover, HMOS vapor causes the polymers to swell and release their tin-based\ncatalyst, which in turn breaks up and caps\npolymers in the silicone adhesive.\nOMES, on the other hand, reacts to produce ethanol, hydrogen gas, and tetramethylsiloxane, none of which attacks the\nsubstrate materials. The hydrogen gas is In\nlow concentrations and quickly diSSipates\nand thus does not create a stress-corrcr\nslon problem for the titanium structure\nunder the substrate.\nThis \'NOrk was done by William L Hili,\nShirley M.

These polyimidazoles have good mechanical properties that make them suitable for use as\nfilms, moldings, and adhesives.\nIn each of the experiments a polyimidazole was prepared from the reaction of\nstoichiometric quantities of 4,5-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl}-2-phenylimidazole and an activated aromatic difluoro compound in the\npresence of potassium carbonate in N,Ndirnethylacetamide (DMAc) (see figure) at\na solids content of 15 to 20 percent. Toluene was used as an azeotroping agent to\nremove the water formed in the reaction,\nand the mixture was stirred at a temperature of rv 155 "C overnight under a nitrogen\natmosphere. The resulting viscous solution\nwas diluted with DMAc and precipitated into water containing acetic acid, to obtain\nthe polymer at a yield of more than 95 percent.\nDMAc solutions of the experimental polyimidazoles were cast onto glass and dried\nto make film specimens. Powders of the\npolymers were compression-molded and\ncut to make tension and fracture-toughness specimens. One of the polymers was\nprocessed into an adhesive-tape specimen by multiple steps of coating from\nDMAc solution followed by drying, and\nused to make tensile shear specimens.\nThe inherent viscosities of the experimental polyimidazoles ranged from 0.24 to\n0.89 dUg, and the glass-transition temperatures ranged from 230 to 318 "C. The\npolyimidazoles were amorphous, as evidenced by differential scanning calorimetry and wide-angle x-ray diffraction\nanalysis. Thermogravimetric analysis\nshowed no loss of weight below a temperature of 300 "C in air or nitrogen, and a loss\nof 5 percent of weight at a temperature of\nrv 400 "C in air and rv 495"C in nitrogen.\nThe melt viscosities of the new compounds\nwere found to be comparable to those of\npoly(arylene ethers) of similar molecular\nweights. The tensile strengths and tensile\nmoduli of thin-film specimens at 25\xc2\xb0C\nranged from 12.0 to 14.2 ksi (82.7 to 97.9\nMPa) and from 362 to 407 ksi (2.50 to 2.81\nGPa), respectively.

A rtfNoI process makes aromatic condensation polyimide films and coatings with dielectric\nconstants that have been lO\'Nered by the\nincorporation of diamic acid adcmives.\nPolyimides are being exploned for four\nprimary applications in microelectronics:\n(1) as fabrication aids, including photoresists, planarizatlon layers, and ion-implant\nmasks; (2) as passivant overcoats and interlevel insulators; (3) as adhesives; and (4)\nas substrate components. To be useful,\nparticularly as a passivant or protective\novercoat, the material must be an excellent insulator. The dielectric constants of\nconventional polyimides currently used as\nstate-of-the-art materials for passivants\nand interlevel dielectrics range from approximately 3 to 4.0. Recent studies at\nNASA Langley Research Center have produced poIyImides with dielectric constants\nin the range of 2.4 to 2.8.\nIn the new process, the adcmives are incorporated into IO\'N-dielectric-constant polyimides to lower the dielectric constants\nfurther. The preparation of a polyimide film\nor coating involves the room-temperature\nreaction of an aromatic diamine in a solvent wnh an aromatic dianhydride to yield a\npoiyamic acid. This polymer resin is then\ncast as a film and thermally cured at 250 to\n300 OC to obtain a poIylmide film.

Studies of the relationship between structures and properties have\nshoym that these are effective means of\nlO\'Nering the dielectric constants of polyimides.\nIn experiments, the additives were incorporated into two polymers, BDSDN4BDAF and 6FDAl4-BDAF. As shown in the\ntable, the 6FDA-An additive 10000red the\ndielectric constant of 6FDAl4-BDAF from\n2.53 to 2.43.

Neural networks are a\nclass of systems modeled after the human\nbrain. Artificial neural networks are famed\nfrom hundreds or thousands of simulated\nneurons, connected to each other in a\nmanner similar to that of neurons in the\nbrain. Problems that involve the matching\nof patterns readily fit the class of problems\nthat NETS is designed to solve.\nNETS uses the back-propagation method of learning for all of the networks that it\ncreates. Typically, the nodes of a network\nare grouped together into clumps called\n"layers." Generally, a network has an input\nlayer through which the various environmental stimuli are presented to the network, and an output layer for determining\nthe response of the network. The number\nof nodes in these two layers is usually tied\nto some features of the problem being\nsolved . Other layers, which form intermediate stops between the input and output layers, are called " hidden layers."\nNETS enables the user to customize the\npatterns of connections between layers of\na network. NETS also provides features for\nsaving the weight values of a network,\nthereby providing for more precise control\nover the learning process.\nNETS is an interpreter. Its method of execution is the familiar " read-evaluateprint" loop found in such interpreted\nlanguages as BASIC and LISP. The user is\npresented with a prompt, which is the simulator\'s way of asking for input. After a\ncommand is issued, NETS attempts to\nevaluate the command. The attempt may\nproduce more prompts that request specific information or may produce an error\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\nsignal if the command is not understooti.\nThe typical process involved when using\nNETS consists of translating the problem\ninto a format that uses input/output pairs,\ndesigning a netvvork configuration for the\nproblem, and finally training the network\nwith input/output pairs until an acceptable\nerror is reached.\nNETS is written in C and can be executed on a variety of machines with no code\nchanges. To date, NETS has been implemented on IBM personal computers and\non .Apple Macintosh, VIV<, SUN, and HP\n9000 computers.

In addition, AFmRAPH\ndefines a metafile format that contains\ndevice-independent graphical data. This\nfile format is used with various computergraphics-manipulation and -animation software packages at Ames, including SURF\n(COSMIC Program ARC-12381) and GAS\n(COSMIC Program ARC-12379).\nIn its full configuration, the ARCGRAPH\nSoftware System consists of a two-stage\n" pipeline" that can be used to put out\ngraphical primitives. Stage one is associated with the graphical primitives (I.e.,\nmoves, draws, color, and the like) along\nwith the creation and manipulation of the\nmetafiles. Five distinct data filters make\nup stage one. They are as follows: (1) PLO,\nwhich handles all two-dimensional vector\nprimitives, (2) POL, which handles all threedimensional polygonal primitives, (3) RAS,\nwhich handles all two-dimensional raster\nprimitives, (4) VEC, which handles all threedimensional raster primitives, and (5) P02,\nwhich handles all two-dimensional polygonal primitives.\nStage two is associated with the process of displaying graphical primitives on\na device. To generate the various graphical\nprimitives, create and reprocess ARCGRAPH metafiles, and obtain access to\nthe device drivers in the VDI (Virtual Device Interface) software library, users link\ntheir application programs to GRAFIX library routines in ARCGRAPH. Both FORTRAN- and C-Ianguage versions of the\nGRAFIX and VDI libraries exist for enhanced portability within these respective\nprogramming environments.\nThe ARCGRAPH libraries were developed on a Vp.;x computer running VMS.\nMinor documented modification of various\nroutines, however, enables the system to\nrun on the following computers: Cray XNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\nMP running COS (no C version), Cray 2\nrunning UNICOS, DEC VAX running BSD\n4.3 UNIX or Ultrix, SGIIRIS Turbo running\nGL2-W3.5 and GL2W3.6, Convex C1 running UNIX, Amhdahl 5840 running UTS,\nAlliant FX8 running UNIX, Sun 3/160 running UNIX (no native device driver), Stellar\nGS1000 running Stellex (no native device\ndriver), and an SGI IRIS 4D running IRIX\n(no native device driver). Currently with version 7.0 of ARCGRAPH, the VDllibrary supports the following output devices: VT100\nterminal with RETRo-GRAPHICS board installed, VT240 using the Tektronix 4010\nemulation capability, SGI IRIS Turbo using\nthe native GL2 library, Tektronix 4010,\nTektronix 4105, ana Tektronix 4014. ARCGRAPH can be purchased separately or\nin a package (COSMIC Program COS10020) containing GAS, ARCGRAPH, and\nSURF.

Both programs, NEWTPOIS (NPO-17715) and\nCUMPOIS (NPO-17714), can be used independently of one another. NEWTPOIS\ndetermines the Poisson parameter for a\ngiven cumulative probability, from which\none can also obtain percentiles for r distributions with integer shape parameters and\npercentiles for x? distributions with even\n\ndegrees of freedom. It can be used by statisticians and others concerned with probabilities of independent events that occur\nover specific units of time, area, or volume.\nNEWTPOIS determines the Poisson parameter (A): that is, the mean (or expected)\nnumber of events occurring in a given unit\nof time, area, or space. Direct calculation\nof the Poisson parameter becomes difficult\nfor small positive values of the number of\noccurrences (n) and unmanageable for\nlarge values. NEWTPOIS uses Newton\'s\niteration method to extract .1., taking successive estimations until some error term\n(\xc2\xa3) specified by the user is reached.\nThe NEWTPOIS program is written in C.\nIt was developed on an IBM AT computer\nwith a numeric coprocessor using Microsoft C 5.0. Because the source code is written using standard C structures and functions, it should compile correctly on most\nC compilers. The program format is interactive, accepting \xc2\xa3, n, and the cumulative\nprobability of the occurrence of n as inputs.\nIt has been implemented under OOS 3.2\nand has a memory requirement of 3OK.\nNEWTPOIS was developed in 1988.\nThis program was written by Paul N.\nBowerman and Ernest M.

The unit controls and monitors the flows of nitrogen and\nhydrogen gases. The unit is designed for\nconnection via a fluid-interface manifold\nplate, reducing the number of mechanical\nfluid-interface connections from 18 to 1,\nand reducing the time required for maintenance.\nCompared to the original system, the\nunit provides the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A reduction in mass of 78 percent, from\n29.8 to 6.5 Ib (13.5 to 2.9 kg);\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A reduction in volume of 77 percent, from\n440 to 100 in.3 (7,210 to 1,640 cm3); and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A reduction in power consumption of 91\npercent, from 21 to 2 W.\nThis redesign is an engineering case\nstudy in techniques for increasing reliability, safety, and ease of maintenance, and\nfor reducing weight, volume, and power\n\nconsumption.\nThe unit performs valving, restriction of\nflow, and sensing of pressure during\nsteady-state operation and intermode transitions. It controls reference and purge\nflows of nitrogen, production flow of nitrogen, vacuum, and vent flows. Operating\ngas pressures range up to 300 psia\n(2 MPa); the proof pressure is 750 psia (5\nMPa).\nThe unit includes six two-state (open or\nclosed) valves. Two motor-<1riven rotary\ncamshafts operate the valves and provide\nthe 14 desired combinations of valve\nstates (out of the 64 possible combinations). Valve transitions take approximately\n2 s. Positive-action valve lifters are used instead of return springs. Both visual and\nelectronic valve-position indicators are\nprovided. The valve-position indicator\npotentiometers are driven by gears to\neliminate exposed electrical contacts.\nA computerized process controller conCover\n\nI\n\ntrOis all functions. A manual override and a\nredundant battery power supply enable actuation of the valves when primary power is\nlost.\nIn 30 days of cyclic testing, which included 2,244 operating cycles and tankfilling sequences, the unit demonstrated\nconsistent and accurate valve positioning,\nexhibited no forward valve leakage at operating pressures, and demonstrated the\nsensitivity, accuracy, and reliability of sensors of pressure and flow.\nThis work was done by B.

The system provides the\nstability against tipping of a four-point rectangular base, without the rocking contact\nto which a rigid four-wheel frame is susceptible. The new four-wheel suspension\nsystem is similar to the six-wheel suspension system described in "Articulated\nSuspension Without Springs" (Nffi-17354),\nNASA Tech Briefs Vol. 14, No.1, p. 60.\nThe elevation of each of the three body\npoints from which the chassis is suspended is determined by the average of the\nelevations of two of the wheels. Thus, the\nsuspension averages over the roughness\nof the terrain to some degree, and provides\na smoother ride than would be obtained if\nthe body were directly supported on three\nwheels located at the suspension points.\nThe four-wheel suspension provides a\ngreater moment arm to resist overturning\nthan does a three-wheel suspension of the\nsame overall length and width. If a wheel\nsinks into a low spot in the terrain, the corresponding corner of the chassis sinks by a\nlesser amount.

The flO\'N fields are usually\ncharacterized by large wakes and periodic\nvortex shedding. Substantial amounts of\nenergy can be required to overcome the\nhigh drag forces associated with such flO\'N\npatterns.\n\nThe Reynolds number associated with\nsmall- and medium-size road vehicles usually falls in the subcritical (1.0 to 2.0 x 10~\nrange. A popular conventional method of\nreducing the aerodynamic drag of noncircular bluff bodies at subcritical Reynolds\nnumbers is the rounding of sharp corners,\nwhich can reduce drag by as much as\nabout 50 percent. The new method consists of the installation of thin, flat panels on\n\nthe forward side of the body, facing the\nairstream (see figure). This concept was\ndeveloped using two-dimensional windand water-tunnel tests on a typical noncircular cytinder.\nPanels of various sizes were employed,\nand their locations on the windward side\nwere varied systematically. Detailed pressure measurements with Reynolds numbers in the subcritical range were performed in a IO\'N-speed, open-circuit wind\ntunnel having a maximum velocity of 115\nft/s (35 mls). Measured surface pressures\nwere integrated to obtain drag coeffiCients,\nand the test results were corrected for\nblockage effects. Systematic water-tunnel\nflO\'N-visualization tests (Reynolds number\n6,000) were also carried out. Both the\nheight and the locations of the panels have\na strong influence on the drag coefficient.\nThe maximum reduction of drag obtained\nin this investigation was 81.5 percent.\nThe panels produce a streamlining effect over the body. The width of the wake is\nreduced, and vortex shedding is greatly\nsuppressed, as evidenced by flO\'N-visualization photographs. This effect is caused\nby the transition in the flO\'N consequent to\nseparation at the panels and subsequent\nsmooth reattachment to the body. The\nreattached flO\'N continues along the surface but eventually separates. This type of\nflO\'N pattern is typical of flO\'N around bluff\nbodies at supercritical Reynolds numbers,\nand the associated drag coefficient is well\n\n=\n\nTo get some tracking, positioning and\ncontrol applications moving the right\nway, the best way is an MSI trackball.\nYou get fast, precise positioning with\nuniform force and no tracking bias in any\ndireaion. Choose from 1" up to 3.5"\ndiameter sizes with push button switches,\n2 or 3 axis capability, with pulse,\nquadrature or serial output, for surface,\npanel or keyboard installation.\nMSI trackballs are found in applications ranging from air traffic control\n\nradar displays to CAD/CAM/CAE\nsystems. For any environment or any\napplication that demands the ultimate\nin hands on technology, specify and\ninsist on MSI controls.

Thus, the\npanels have made supercritical flow possible at subcritical Reynolds numbers.\nA novel feature \'of this technique is the\ngeneration of significant suction over the\nwindward face. Wrth panels on the windward face, the positive pressures are confined to the region bounded by the panels.\nBetween the panels and the windward corners, high suction is produced by the sharp\nturning of the flow. These negative pres-\n\nsures contribute significantly to the reduction of drag and are responsible for the\ndrastic fall in the drag coefficient.\nThe installation of flat panels is quite\nsimple and should not require a major\nmodification of the shape and size of the\nbody to which they are attached.

By plotting the load against the reduced displacement or against the increase in slope, the\nload at which the crack is really open can\nbe determined. One of the main disadvantages of these methods is that the signals\nfrom strain sensors, such as extensiometers, are noisy. Because of this, there is\nuncertainty in the determination of the\ncrack-opening load.\nThe fl9ure shows a compact tension specimen with a transmitting and a receMng\ntransducer mounted so that the acoustic\nsignal passes through the cracked region.\nA signal generator sends out a burst of a\nspecific frequency. This signal is amplified\nand sent to the transmitting transducer,\nwhere it excites acoustic waves in the\nspecimen. These waves propagate toward\nthe cracked region. When the crack is\nclosed, the acoustic signal is transmitted\n\nacross the cracked region by the portions\nof the two surfaces that are in intimate contact. As the surfaces of the crack begin to\nseparate, the signal propagates only during a portion of the cycle, giving rise to a\nmechanical "rectification" of the acoustic\nsignal. The action of a barely opened crack\nis to enrich the relative proportion of the\nsecond harmonic of the signal.\nThe acoustic signal, as a~ered by the\ncrack, travels to the receMng transducer,\nthe output of which is processed by a receiver. The frequency is selected by tuning\nthe receiver. The output of the receiver is\nmonitored by an oscilloscope. The process\nis repeated at different loads while holding\nthe received fundamental-frequency output fixed. The harmonic output is measured and plotted as a function of load.\nOne advantage of this technique is a\ndefinite improvement in signal-to-noise\n\nratio. The process also possesses substantial immunity from the noise that is caused\nby the operation of the load frame and its\nassociated parts. In addition to applications for the aerospace community, this\nmonitor and concept clearly have general\nutility in the testing of materials and potentially in nondestructive evaluation of solid\nparts.\nThis vvork was done by William T. Yost of\nlangley Research Center. For further information, Circle 150 on the TSP Request\nCard.\nThis invention has been patented by\nNASA (US. Patent No. 4,823,609).

At the\nsame time, users can avoid the cost of premature, unnecessary maintenance.\nThe probe is inserted through a port directly into the combustion gas stream. The\ninstrument includes a conventional calorimeter apparatus and a heat-flux meter\nin a cylindrical probe (see figure). The\ncalorimeter yields data on the average\nfouling in the system, and the heat-flux\nmeter yields data on the fouling at its location. Both parts measure, in real time, the\nflow of heat through the wall of the probe;\nwhen the flow falls below a predetermined\nlevel, fouling has become excessive.\nProducts of combustion include, in addition to noncondensing gases, a variety of\nimpurities - particles, drops of liquid, and\ncondensible gases. As hot combustion\nproducts cool in a heat exchanger, some of\nthe impurities deposit on the heat-transfer\nsurface. The deposits - fouling - gradually accumulate and eventually seriously impair the transfer of heat. Users of fossil\nfuels have long recognized a need for a\nstandardized gas-side fouling measuring\ndevice like that embodied in the new instrument.\nThe heat-flux meter is electron-beamwelded in a window cut into the probe and\nis in direct contact with the stream of gas. It\nconsists of a sandwich of Chromel layers\non an alloy, with electrical leads insulated\nwith alumina tubes and sleeves of woven\nceramic fiber. The electrical output of this\n58\n\nthermopile represents the rate of flow of\nheat through the meter.\nThe calorimeter includes an inner airfeeding tube within the hollow cylindrical\nprobe. Cool air enters through the inner\ntube and flows out through the annular gap\nbetween the inner tube and inner wall of\nthe outer probe tube, absorbing heat from\nthe wall as it does. A control system varies\nthe rate of flow of air to maintain the inside\ntemperature of the probe wall at a constant\nvalue. The average heat flux is calculated\nfrom the temperatures of the air at the inlet\n\nand outlet and the mass-flow rate of air.\nMade of 304 stainless steel for strength\nand resistance to corrOSion, the probe tube\nwithstands severe thermal-shock and wideranging temperature cycles. In tests, the instrument operated over a wide range of\nconditions, including gas temperatures\nfrom 745 to 2,214 OF (396 to 1,212\xc2\xb0G),\nvelocities from 9.91 to 27.7 ftIs (3.02 to 8.44\nm/s), and heat fluxes from 3,440 to 40,800\nBtu/(heft2) (10.84 to 128.6 kW/m2).\nThis vvork was done by Wilbur J.

The outputs of the probes are\nsent to a relatively simple electronic control subsystem that includes only differentiators, filters, and amplifiers. The output of\nthe control subsystem is fed to amplifiers\nthat drive the piezoelectric actuators. If the\ncontrol subsystem is designed properly\nwith respect to electronic and mechanical\nstability and the vibrational modes and\ndamping of the rotor, actuators, and supports, then the amplitudes and phases of\nthe signals applied to the actuators should\nbe such as to oppose the vibrations. Figure 2 shows the results of an experiment in which one end of a rotor was suspended by a system like that of Rgure 1.\nThe rotor was deliberately unbalanced and\noperated at various speeds, including the\ncritical speeds for the onset of instability\ncaused by resonant coupling between rotations and vibrations. The plots show that\nwith sufficient feedback gain, the amplitudes of vibrations at the critical frequency\nare reduced by factors of about 5. The\nplots also show that the increase in feedback gain increases the critical frequencies for instability. This suggests that one\nmight vary the feedback gain during runup\nor coastdown to avoid instability as the\nspeed passes through the critical range.\nThis \'NOrk was done by Albert F.

These systems\nare intended primarily to enhance safety\nand prevent damage in rotating machinery\nby sensing and counteracting vibrations.\nThe new systems should be particularly\nuseful in suppressing unpredictable vibrations caused by changes in loads, losses of\nrotating components (e.g., turbine blades)\nand the consequent imbalances in rotors,\nand the ingestion of foreign objects into turbines.\nThe new systems offer several advantages over other active and passive vibration-suppressing systems. The piezoelectric actuators are compact , light in weight,\nand capable of operation at temperatures\n\nfrom cryogenic to above ambient. Unlike\nsqueeze-film dampers, they do not require\nheavy, bulky lubrication systems. In contrast with active magnetic suspension systems, the piezoelectric systems require\nmuch simpler electronic control subsystems and do not require large electromagnet coils. Also unlike magnetic systems,\npiezoelectric systems continue to provide\nsupport and some passive damping even\nwhen electronic control subsystems or\npower supplies fail.\nIn a representative system (see Rgure\n1), the housing of a ball bearing that supports one end of a rotor shaft is supported\nby horizontal and vertical piezoelectric\nactuators.

Measurements of both steady\nand fluctuating pressures were taken at\nvarious locations on the diffuser vanes of\nthe vaned diffuser and on the shroud walls\nof both the vaned and vaneless diffusers.\nThe measurements were taken at various\nflow coefficients, shaft speeds, and radial\ngaps between the blades and vanes.\nThe fluctuations In pressure were found\nto be larger on the suction side than on the\npressure side of a vane. The maximum fluctuations occurred in the vicinity of the\nleading edge and were of the order of magnitude of the total rise In pressure through\nthe pump. For a radial gap of 1.5 percent of\nthe radius of the Impeller at the discharge\nend, the pressure on the suction side of a\nvane was found to fall locally below the\nupstream pressure immediately after the\ntrailing edge of an Impeller blade has\npassed the leading edge of the vane. The\nlarge fluctuations In pressure on the front\nhalf of the suction side of a vane decreased\nby about 50 percent when the radial gap\nwas Increased from 1.5 to 4.5 percent.\nThe steady and unsteady components\nof lift on a vane were computed from the\npressure measurements at its mid height.\nThe magnitude of the fluctuating compcr\nnent was found to be greater than that of\nthe steady component, indicating that the\nvane is subject to a large periodic load. The\nmagnitude of the fluctuating component\nand the ratio of magnitude of the fluctuating component to that of the steady\ncomponent were found to decrease strongIy when the gap was increased from 1.5 to\n4.5 percent.\nThe fluctuations in pressure near the\nhub were found to be considerably larger\nthan were those near the shroud.

Ozone Is at least as effective as other chemicals in controlling\nthe growth of microbiota in the tower and in\nthe recirculation system and in inhibiting\nthe deposition of scale in heat-exchanger\ntubes and water boxes.\nOperating and maintenance costs with\nthe ozone treatment are about 30 percent\nof those of treatment by other chemicals.\nCorrosion rates with ozone are no greater\nthan those with other chemicals - 3 to 5\nmils (0.08 to 0.13 mm) per year. Moreover,\nozone, unlike other chemicals, does not\ncontaminate the environment.\nA further advantage of ozone is that,\neven though it is poisonous, it can be quickIy detected by smell in very low concentrations. The U.S. Government has set a maximum-continuous-exposure level of 0.1\nppm, but ozone has a perceptible odor at\n0.01 to 0.02 ppm. Coughing and eyewatering occur long before dangerous\nconcentrations are reached.\nThe ozone treatment was tested in a\ntower that had a recirculating flow of 1,700\ngallmin (107 Us) and a total volume of\n6,000 gal (22,700 L). An ozone generator\nproduced 4.75 IbId or 90 g/h. The ozone\nwas introduced into the Circulating water\nby all in-line contactor. Air was prepared\nfor the generator by an oilless compressor\nand a dual heatless air dryer. The dryer\nreduced the cJev.Ipoint of the air to - 60 DF\n(- 51 DC) at a pressure of 15 psi (0.1 MPa).\nA previous study had shown that dry air\nwas necessary for the efficient production\nof ozone; as the moisture in the source air\nincreases, the concentration of Nps increases, and that of ozone decreases.\nBefore the ozone treatment, the average bacteria count on the cooling tower\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\nwas 3 X 106. Wrthin 3 weeks of the start of\nozone treatment, the count had dropped to\n200 to 300. The bacterial growth and scale\non the slats of the tower became soft and\nloose, and much of it fell off. Furthermore,\nthe treatment removed scale and prevented further deposition by reversing the\ncalcium carbonate equilibrium toward the\nbicarbonate salt; by precipitating calcium\nIons and other metal ions as a fine, sandy\ndeposit in the tower basin; or by a combination of these two effects.\nThis work was done by Rick Blackwelder\nof Kennedy Space Center and Leroy V.\nBaldwin and Bien S.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nFIRST HALF\nAlgorithms may distribute the load of\nmany identical, short computations among\nmultiple parallel digital data processors,\neach of which has its own (local) memory.\nEach processor operates on a distinct and\nindependent set of data in a larger shared\nmemory. As an integral part of the loadbalancing scheme, the total amount of\nspace used in the shared memory is minimized. Fbssible applications include artificial\nneural networks or image processors for\nwhich the "pipeline" and vector methods\nof load balancing may be inappropriate.\nTERMS: A process is a computation\nand/or other operation upon total memory,\nwhich is the sum of all shared memory, both\nsource (read but not changed) and target\n[changed by some process(es)]. A memory\npartition is a disjoint subset of either source\nor target memory (but not both) sharing no\nmembers with any other subset. A partition threshold is some number of partitions\nthat represent the current maximum memory size allowed for a processing set, or\ncollection of processes. Load is a number\nproportional to the time it takes to complete\nthe process. The desired load is the balance\nload, equal to the sum of all loads divided\nby the number of processing units.\nThe first half of the algorithm (see figure)\ncollects processes into processing sets.\nFirst, a two-dimensional array or "grid" of\nthe shared memory is created, with source\nmemory on one axis and target memory on\nthe other. Next, values are placed at each\nintersection of source/target-memory pairs\nto represent the load (or section of load) of\nthe process that operates upon that source/\ntarget pair. Then source and target memo-\n\nries are divided on the grid, creating rectangular regions with one source and one\ntarget partition, so that no process is spread\nacross two regions. Regions are then sorted\nin terms of the sum of the loads included\nwithin their bounds. Any regions exceeding\nthe balance load are split into equal parts,\neach with the same source/target-partition\npair and no more than the desired balance\nload.\nThe second half of the algorithm performs\nmergers of processing sets by combining\none processing set at a time with another\nset that can take on some or all of the load.\nThis is repeated until the total number of sets\nequals the number of processing units. First,\nthe smallest processing set,S, is chosen.\n"Merge candidates" are found among all\nother processing sets that have loads smaller than the balance load. My merge that\nwould exceed the partition threshold is discarded. Of the remaining candidates, the\none that has the most partitions in common\nwith 5 is chosen as the target for merge.\nExecution of the algorithm is very quick\nwhen a small number of partitions is used\n(the first half of the algorithm runs in linear\ntime; the second half runs in constant time).\nThus the second half of the process can\nbe repeated several times, each with a different starting partition threshold, and the\n"best" (or lowest threshold) solution chosen.\nBecause the algorithm uses such a simple\nmerging heuristic, it is not possible to generalize an ideal starting partition threshold.\nMaking multiple runs of the algorithm is the\nonly way to obtain the best result.\nThis oork was done by Paul Thomas\nBaffes of Johnson Space Center.

The result of the iteration is a balancing of computational load (including memory) among the processors of a\nparallel multiprocessor system.\n\nther information, Circle 55 on the TSP Request Card.\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.

The criterion of performance is based upon the mean-square\nerror of the difference between the sampled and reconstructed functions . The\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\nanalysis is applicable to reconstruction\nalgorithms used in the processing of\nsignals and images and to many of the\ntypes of interpolants used in numerical\nanalysis, computer-aided design, and\ncomputer graphics. When formulated in\nthe frequency domain, the mean-square\n\nerror clearly separates the contribution of\nthe interpolation method from that of the\nsampled data and provides a rational basis\nfor selecting an "optimal" interpolant; i.e.,\none that will minimize the mean-square error.\nThe method has been applied to a selec67\n\ntion of frequently used interpolants: parametric cubic and quintic Hermite splines,\nexponential and v splines Qncluding the\nspecial case of the cubic spline), parametric cubic convolution (PCC), Keys\nfourth-order cubic, and a cubic with a\ndiscontinuous first derivative. The method\nis applicable to band-limited data sampled\nat fixed intervals in which the sampling rate\nexceeds the Nyquist frequency and the reconstruction is linearly dependent on the\nsample values. The performances of these\ntechniques have been analyzed for the\ncase in which no a priori knowledge of the\nfrequency spectrum of the sampled func-\n\ntion is assumed other than that of bandlimited sufficient sampling.\nIt was found that with proper identification of parameters, interpolation with parametric cubic Hermtte splines (developed\nfor computer graphics and curve fitting) is\nidentical to reconstruction with parametriC\ncubic convolution (a family of algorithms\nfor the reconstruction of signals and images). Of all the interpolants investigated,\nthe cubic spline provides the best performance. In general, the addition of tension to\na cubic spline. in the form of either an exponential or v spline, increases the meansquare error. Rfth-degree Hermite splines\n\nshCMled no advantage over third-degree\nHermite splines. However, a parametric\nquintic spline possesses two parameters\nthat might be selected to tailor an optimal\ninterpolant for a specific application. Of the\nreconstruction algorithms studied, Keys\ncubic exhibited the best performance, as\nexpected, followed by the very similar\ncubic Hermite/PCC with a\nV2, and a\ncubic with a discontinuous first derivative.\nThis work was done by Dona/d L.\nLanSing and Stephen K.

The truncated images would be\nprocessed by image-correlating algorithms to extract information; for example,\nto recognize features and to track the\ndisplacements of features in subsequent\nimage frames to determine velocities. The\nprincipal advantage of the truncated images is that they would entail the correlation of far fewer data than the original images would. Thus, correlations could be\nperformed on relatively small computers\nor, alternatively, much more rapidly on\nlarger computers.\nThe image recorded on a charge<X)Upleddevice or other suitable camera during a\nframe period would first be subjected to a\nthresholding operation so that up to three\nsalient features could be selected for further processing.

This development has significance for the reorientation, pointing, and\nslewing of airplanes, helicopters, spacecraft, and rigid oojects held by single or\nmultiple robot arms.\nIn most approaches that have prevailed\nheretofore, attitude dynamics are linearized, and a three-parameter local representation of orientations is used. However,\nbecause there are no globally nonsingular\nthree-parameter.representations of orientation, planning of paths becomes complicated, and admissible attitudes can be\nseriously constrained. This undesirably\nlimits the allowable motions for purely\nmathematical reasons that have nothing to\ndo with what is physically possible. In contrast, the new approach involves the use of\nthe globally nonsingular four-parameter\nunit-quaternion (Euler-parameter) representation. The attitude dynamics are described by the nonlinear Euler equation\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\ntogether with the nonlinear kinematic\nequations, which relate a representation of\nattitude to the angular velocity of the body.\nA second unique feature of the new approach is the use of a suitable energy-motivated Lyapunov function to analyze stability.\nIn the case of nonadaptive tracking control,\nthe candidate Lyapunov functions consist\nof three basic terms: the kinetic energy of\nthe error (the kinetic energy with the angular-velocity error substituted for the angular\nvelocity), the desired potential energy, and\na product term of angular momentum and\nsome measure of the position error. An\nanalysis based on the use of this Lyapunov\nfunction results in global convergence of\nthe error to zero. The product term is\nchosen small enough that the Lyapunov\nfunction is positive definite. The sole purpose of this term is to establish local exponential convergence of the error to zero\nand facilitate generalizations to adaptive\ncontrol.

Though the\ntechnique was devised to detect faults in\nthe Space Shuttle main engine, the underlying concept could prove useful in\nmonitoring automotive engines, chemicalprocessing plants, powerplants, and other\nsystems in which the outputs of sensors\ncontain noise or other fluctuations in the\nmeasured quantities.\nThe output of each sensor is sampled\nperiodically (e.g., every few milliseconds),\nand an average is computed from samples\ntaken during an averaging period of, say,\n80 to 100 ms. This sampling-and-averaging\nprocedure is repeated during subsequent\nsampling periods, providing a sequence\nof averages. One can also multiply each\naverage by the averaging period to obtain\nthe integral average, which is an approximation of the integral of the signal during\nthe averaging period. In the average or integral average, noise and other short-term\nfluctuations are suppressed more than are\nthe more-smoothly-varying components of\nthe signal. In effect, the sequence of averages or integral averages is a sequence\nof samples of a smoothed or low-pass-filtered version of the signal.\nThe sequence of averages or integral\naverages is recorded. The standard deviation of all the averages or integral averages\nin the sequence from the beginning of operation up to the present moment is computed. At the beginning of a nominallysteady-state operating condition, "a safety band" of three standard deviations computed from past measurements is placed\naround the average of the averages in the\nsequence from past measurements. This\nprecomputed "safety band" is used for a\nspecified period (e.g., 2 seconds). Thereafter, the integral average is updated every .\naveraging period to incorporate the latest\naverage or integral average. If the most recent average or integral average(s) from\na given sensor falls outside its most-recently-computed safety band during a specified number of consecutive averaging\nperiods (or if this occurs for all sensors in\na specified group during one or more consecutive averaging periods), then an alarm\ncan be given.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1990\n\nMacsyma\xc2\xae\n...\nthe most powerful\nmath software\nin the world of\nworkstations,\nmainframes,\nandPCs*\n\nWhen it comes to solving\ncomplex symbolic and numerical\nmath problems , there\'s no substitute\nfor power.

The methodology uses a top-down approach. In a\nseries of steps, it makes connections between the high-level mission requirements\nand the lower-level functional performance\nrequirements. The steps include the following:\n1. Identification of system actMties,\n2. Identification of the actMty-derived statevector elements associated with each ac-\n\ntMty,\n\n3. Definition of state-maintenance functions, and\n4. Affirmation of the need for performance\nrequirements for each state-vector-maintenance action.\nBecause the methodology follows a tOJF\ndown structure in a sequence of branch\npoints - that is, a tree - traceability is a\nbuilt~n feature. Connections between components and mission requirements are\nestablished in the process of laying out requirements. For a given system, a preliminary layout of performance requirements\ncould be established in a set of data. Automation would then enable a computer to\nscan the data and answer questions about\nwhich component will limit the performance of the system or which mission actMty will impose the most<lifficult design requirements on a given component.\nThe tOJFdown structure provides for a\nsystematic delineation of elements that\nmight accommodate design compromises. Trades at the component level can be\nidentified by systematic pairings of components. Generally, a potential trade will exist\n\nThis work was done by Hagop V.\nPanossian of Rockwell International Corp.\nfor Marshall Space Flight Center.

At the\nsubsystem-function level, trades can be\nmade among the requirements for each\nfunction. Trades also exist between levels,\nbetween components and subsystems,\nand between subsystems and missions.\nThe methodology aids the evolution of a\nsystem design. After the first complete set\nof requirements has been established, design-trade studies can be done, and components can be specified. The specified\nsystem can then be mapped upward by\nsimulation from components to the performance of the mission, in a process that\nis essentially a mirror image of the decomposition of the complete system requirements.\nThis work was done by Harvey L.\nMalchow and Steven R.

The\nmodel, which includes electronic and me\xc2\xb7\nchanical elements, is based on published\nexperimental studies of nerve/muscle interactions. It is homeomorphic at the level\nof its three major building blocks, which\nrepresent the motoneuron, the dynamics\nof activation of muscle, and the mechanics\nof the muscle, respectively.\nThe motoneuron block is a highly sim\xc2\xb7\nplified submodel that reproduces the important short\xc2\xb7term dynamical phenomena.\nThis block consists of a trans resistance\namplifier, high-pass filter, and voltage-tofrequency converter (see figure). Its output\nis a series of unit-value action-potential impulses that exhibit a decline in firing rate\n(adaptation) with constant-current input.\nThe activation.(jynamics block, which is\nnot homeomorphic in its details, includes a\npulse-frequency-to-voltage converter, a\nunit that implements a piecewise\'linear\ngain-versus-voltage function, a nonlinear\nresistor-and-capacitor low-pass filter, and a\nmultiplier. This block multiplies the effects\nof the action-potential impulses to produce\nan increase, dependent upon the intervals\nbetween the impulses, in the force produced by the muscle in response to each\nimpulse in the sequence. This interval<1ependent enhancement of force is known to\nworkers in the field as the "catch-like effect."\nThe muscle\xc2\xb7mechanics block represents a second-order nonlinear model of a\nsingle muscle removed from a sixth-order\nnonlinear model of a joint movement. This\nblock contains a subblock that represents\na first-order model of activation and deactivation. The output of the subblock represents a tension proportional to a Iow-pass\xc2\xb7\nfiltered version of the input. The muscle\nforce is coupled to the load through a\nseries elastic element, represented by a\nspring, which may be nonlinear. The internal viscosity of the muscle, which diminish\xc2\xb7\nes the force it can apply, is represented by\n\nNASA Tec h Brie fs , Aug ust 1990\n\na nonlinear dashpot.\nThe PEA model was developed to extend a previously successful modeling\nstrategy to "early" dynamics; that is, those\ninvolving times less than one\xc2\xb7hundred milli\xc2\xb7\nseconds. The addition of the motoneuron\nand "catch-effect" blocks is intended to\n\nhelp develop an understanding of the control of the fastest voluntary movements.\nThis work was done by Blake Hannaford\nof Ca/tech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The electrode is intended to provide electrical stimuli to\nmuscles that have become inactive through\naccident or disease. The stimuli can help\nparaplegics and others to exercise voluntary control over arms and legs.\nThe electrode is covered with fuzzy material like Velcro (or equivalent) loops of\nplastic thread. For insertion, the electrode\nis housed in a sheath. A release tube within\nthe sheath surrounds the electrode wire.\nOnce the electrode is inserted, its position\ncan be finely adjusted to produce maximum muscle response.\nAfter the electrode has been finely positioned in the tissue, the sheath is retracted\nto expose the fuzzy surface. Encouraged\nby a coating of collagen on the surface, the\ntissue should grow into the fuzzy material\xc2\xb7\nin several days, thereby securing the electrode in place. To keep the tissue from attaching to it, the sheath is covered with polytetrafluoroethylene.\nWhile the new tissue is grovving, the\nelectrode is held in place by fingers on the\nrelease tube, which engage an annular\ngroove on the electrode. The electrode\nmay be repositioned as required during the\ngrovvth period. When grovvth is complete,\nthe sheath is retracted farther, exposing\nthe fingers so that they spring away and\nrelease the electrode.\nThe wire to the electrode is momentarily\ndetached from the embedded electrode so\nthat the release tube and sheath can be\nremoved. Alternatively, if it Is necessary not\nto disturb the electrical connection, the\ntube and sheath can be fabricated in\nhalves. Held together by tape during the\n\ngrowth of the tissue, the halves would be\nseparated from around the wire after withdrawal from the body.\nThis work was done by Earl R. Collins,\nJr., of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nAn emergency breathing apparatus\nstores air as a cryogenic liquid instead of\nthe usual compressed gas. The liquid-air\npack can supply air for 60 minutes or\nmore - longer than the previous compressed-air version does. It is also more\ncompact than the previous apparatus is an important advantage in rescue operations.\nThe pack is worn on the user\'s back. It\nweighs approximately 28 Ib (12.7 kg) when\nfull and 221b (1 0 kg) when empty. It supplies\ngaseous air at regulated pressure at a rate\n74\n\nof 50 liters per minute. The apparatus is\ncharged with liquefied air just before use. It\nis intended for firefighting or rescue operations that may become necessary during\nplanned potentially hazardous procedures.\nIt holds liquid air in a 3.5-liter Dewar tank\nand employs tubing and an accumulator to\nconvert the liquid into gas. A series of\nvalves regulates the pressure of the air\nsupplied to the user. A backup pressurecontrol system is included.\nAfter 2 years of testing, no malfunctions\nhave occurred in the liquid-air pack. The\n\nonly major disadvantage is that the unit is\nnot designed to work for long intervais\nwhile the user is lying down.\nThis work was done by Robert D. Mills of\nEG&G Florida, Inc., for Kennedy Space\nCenter.
