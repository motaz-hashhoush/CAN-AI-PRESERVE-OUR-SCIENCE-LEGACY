They are also being applied to the study of cratering histories. The surfaces are generated in steps which attempt to mimic geologic episodes. Surface roughness is realized fractally, while craters and other specific features have shapes and distributions dictated by observation. Surface materials are assigned appropriate albedos, making the images more realistic. With the inclusion of correlations between crater and rock distributions, the simulations are beginning to acquire a predictive capability.", "title": "Martian surface simulations", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T02:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930060277, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gaskell, Robert W."}, "organization": {"name": "JPL", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "bd517f6b455c4ab69c9b2094d9982940"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930060277, "publications": [{"volume": "98", "submissionId": 19930060277, "issue": "E6", "issn": "0148-0227", "id": "af5508255e724d86a1fa7ed2f1448579", "publicationName": "Journal of Geophysical Research", "publicationDate": "1993-06-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
