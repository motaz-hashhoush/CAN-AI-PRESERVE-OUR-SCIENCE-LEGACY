b'Abstract for 47th International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES)\n\nUS Navy Submarine Sea Trial of NASA developed Multi-Gas Monitor\nPaul D.

Pilgrim\nVista Photonics Inc\nLas Cruces, NM\nDuring a successful 2 year technology demonstration of the tunable diode laser\nspectroscopy (TDLS) based Multi-Gas Monitor (MGM) on the International Space\nStation (ISS), we began discussing with the US Navy the possibility of conducting a sea\ntrial of an MGM on a submarine. The sea trial would also include a gas\nchromatography/differential mobility spectrometer based Air Quality Monitor (AQM),\nwhich is used operationally on ISS for select volatile organic compounds. AQM results\nwill be the subject of a separate paper. The Navy\xe2\x80\x99s interest in testing NASA equipment\nis in a planned update to the environmental monitoring equipment used aboard\nsubmarines. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s goal is studying submarines as closed environment analogs to\nspacecraft. MGM\xe2\x80\x99s core technology was developed by Vista Photonics Inc using Small\nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) grants and expanded for various applications using\nNASA program funding. The MGM measures oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and\nwater vapor in ambient air, displays concentrations with temperature and pressure, and\nstores 30 second moving averages. The sea trial involves colocating the instrument with\nthe Central Air Monitor (CAM) and connecting it to rack power prior to departure, and\nletting it run during the entire sea trial of a few months duration. All data stored is inside\nMGM, with no connection to the vessel data bus. Crew intervention is limited to\nchecking MGM periodically to see that it is working and power cycling if the display is\nOFF. After the trial is over, the unit with its data will be retrieved. Post sea trial\ncalibration check and data analysis are planned and results will be compared with both\nCAM data and results from MGM\xe2\x80\x99s ISS technology demonstration.\n\n'
