Normally only time-average temperature is measured.\nFluctuations in gas temperature are, however, of great concern for hot section durability and combustor modeling activities. In this measuring system\n(Elmore et al., 1983, 1984, 1986a, and 1986b; and Stocks and Elmore, 19861, a\nprobe with two wire thermocouples of different diameters provides dynamic signals with limited frequency response. Comparing these signals over a range of\nfrequencies makes it possible to generate a compensation spectrum sufficient\nto provide compensated temperature data at frequencies up to 1000 Hz.\n\nMEASURES GAS TEMPERATURE\nFLUCTUATIONS AT THE EXIT OF A\nTURBINE ENGINE COMBUSTOR\n\nA TWO-ELEMENT PROBE PROVIDES\nDATA TO PERMIT ACCURATE\nFREQUENCY COMPENSATION\n\nCD-87-29397\n\n3-325\n\nDYNAMIC GAS TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT\nThis figure shows dynamic gas temperature data obtained from a probe at the\nturbine inlet of a PWA F-100 engine operating at an intermediate power setting\nwith an average turbine inlet gas temperature of 1700 O F . The plot on the left\nis the dynamic signal from a 0.003-in.-diameter wire thermocouple with no frequency compensation. The rms value of the temperature fluctuation is 74 OF.\nThe plot on the right is the compensated signal from the same thermocouple.\nThe rms value of the temperature fluctuation is 390 OF and the peak-to-peak\nfluctuation is 2900 O F . Such a large temperature fluctuation implies that\nthere are filaments of primary combustion gas and dilution gas within the combustor exhaust stream.\n\nTEMPERATURE AT TURBINE INLET\nTEMPERATURE,\n"F\n\n400\n\nTEMPERATURE,\n\n"F\n\nr\n\n1500\n\n74 "F rms\n\n200\n\n390 "F rms\n\n1000\n\n0\n\nr\n\n0\n\n- 200\n- 1000\n\n-1500\n\n-400\n\n0\n\n250\n\n500\n\n0\n\n250\n\n500\n\nTIME, msec\n\ncn on\n\n3-326\n\n37747\n\nORIGINAL PEiGE\nCOMBUSTOR VIEWING SYSTEM\n\n1s\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nThe Combustor Viewing System (Morey, 1984 and 1985) was designed to provide\nrecorded images of the interior of a combustor during operation; the objective\nwas to produce a visual record of some of the causes of premature hot section\nfailure. The system consists of a water-cooled optical probe (shown below), a\nprobe actuator, an optical interface unit that couples the probe to cameras\nand to an illumination source, and system controls. The probe is 0 . 5 in. in\ndiameter, small enough to fit into an igniter port. The actuator provides\n+180\xc2\xb0 of rotation and radial insertion of up to 3 in. Both wide and narrow\nfields of view and different viewing axes are provided from two different\nprobes. The probes are water cooled and gas purged and can operate within the\nprimary combustion zone of a combustor.\n\nCD-88-32748\n\n3-327\n\nHEATFLUXSENSORS\nAn environmental parameter of interest for hot section durability is heat flux.\nWehave developed miniature heat flux sensors which can be welded into combustor liners (Atkinson and Strange, 1982; and Atkinson et al., 1983) and built\ninto cooled turbine airfoils\n(Atkinson et al., 1984). This figure shows one\nsensor configuration based on the Gardon gage design. An innovation in these\nsensors is the use of the burner liner or airfoil\nmaterial as part of a differential thermocouple circuit.\nCalibration tests (Atkinson and Strange, 1982;\nand Holanda, 1984) on these materials showedthat this technique could provide\nacceptable signals.\nThe differential\nthermocouple simplifies construction and\npermits a direct measurementof the differential\ntemperature proportional to\nheat flux.\nThese miniature heat flux sensors must be calibrated over the\ntemperature range in which they will be used.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 MEASURE HEAT FLUX ON BURNER\nLINERS AND TURBINE AIRFOILS\n\nHIGH-TEMPERATURE HEAT FLUX SENSOR\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 MINIATURE WIRE THERMOCOUPLE\nSENSOR:\n\n\\\\\n\\\n\nWELD INTO BURNER LINERS\nBUILD INTO AIRFOILS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SENSOR BODY PART OF\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.:.\',\'.\'.v."...:\n\nTHERMOCOUPLE CIRCUIT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CALIBRATION SYSTEM REQUIRED\n\n\'-CHROMEL\n\ni!iii!iii!!i\n\n:_\n.....\n"\n_\'- BLADE WALL\n\n!iiiiii!ii!i\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2_\n\nCD- 88\n\n3-328\n\n32749\n\nCOMBUSTOR SEGMENT INSTRUMENTED WITH HEAT FLUX SENSORS\nThis photograph shows a segment of a combustor liner which has been instrumented with six heat flux sensors. The sensors are 0.3-in.-diameter disks with\nthermocouple leads radiating from the edge of the disk. The actual sensor part\nof the unit is at the center of the disk and is only 0.06 in. in diameter.\nThe sensors are individually calibrated and then welded into holes cut in the\nliner. Tests on combustors such as this one have produced useful heat flux\ndata over a range of combustor operating conditions (Atkinson et al., 1985a).\nSimilar sensors built into turbine airfoils have been less successful because\nof the sensitivity of these sensors to temperature or heat flux gradients,\nwhich are more prevalent in turbine airfoils (Atkinson et al., 1985b). Sensor\ndesigns that are less sensitive to gradients have been examined but have not\nyet been put into use.\n\nCD-88-32750\n\n3-329\n\nTHIN-FILM THERMOCOUPLES\nLewis has been the major advocate and sponsor for development of thin-film\nsensors for turbine engine applications. Sensors applicable to turbine\nengines include temperature sensors, strain gages, and heat flux sensors.\nThin-film thermocouples for measuring the surface temperature of a cooled turbine airfoil are shown here. The surface of the vane is covered with A1203\nthermally grown from an anticorrosion coating and augmented with sputtered\nAl2O3. Platinum and Pt-Rh films are sputter deposited with thermocouple junctions formed by overlapping the two films at the desired spot. The films\nextend to the base of the vane where leadwires are connected. The sensor is\nless than 0.001 in. thick. The advantage of this technique over the previous\ntechnology, which required swaged thermocouple wires to be buried into grooves\ncut into the surface, should be obvious. This technology has been developed\n(Grant and Przybyszewski, 1980, and Grant et al., 1981 and 1982) for turbine\nairfoil temperature measurement. Further work has been directed at other sensor types, other sensor and substrate materials, and maturing the technology\n(Grant et al., 1983; Kreider et al., 1984; Kreider and Semancik, 1985; Prakash\net al., 1985; and Budhani et al., 1986a and 1986b).\n\nMEASURE SURFACE TEMPERATURE\nOF COOLED TURBINE AIRFOILS\nFABRICATION: SPUTTER ALLOY\nFILM LEADS OVER INSULATING\nCOATING ON AIRFOIL SURFACE\nSENSOR THICKNESS, <0.001 in.\n\nCO-88-32751\n\n3-330\n\nHIGH-TEMPERATURE\n\nSTRAIN\n\nMEASURING\n\nSYSTEMS\n\nThe most ambitious\ngoal of the research\nsensor\nprogram\nis development\nof hightemperature\n(1800 \xc2\xb0F) strain\nmeasuring\nsystems.\nApproaches\nbeing\nfollowed\nin\nthis work include\nboth wire and thin-film\nresistance\nstrain\ngages and remote\nmeasuring\nsystems.\nOur resistance\nstrain\ngage work has included\nwork on new\nstrain\ngage materials\n(Hulse\net al., 1985 and 1987a;\nand Lei, 1987) and testing of available\nstrain\ngages,\nincluding\nthe Chinese\n700 \xc2\xb0C gages\n(Hobart,\n1985;\nStetson,\n1984; and Hulse et al., 1987b).\nWork on remote\nstrain\n,leasuring\nsystems\nhas involved\nthree different\nsystem\nconcepts\nbased\non laser speckle\npatterns\n(Stetson,\n1983; and Lant and Qaqish,\n1987a and 1987b).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GOAL:\nMEASURE STATIC STRAIN ON TEST SAMPLES AND TURBINE ENGINE COMPONENTS AT\nTEMPERATURES UP TO 1800 \xc2\xb0F\n\xe2\x80\xa2 APPROACHES:\nRESISTANCE STRAIN GAGES-WIRE GAGES\nTHINFILM GAGES\nREMOTE STRAIN MEASURING SYSTEM-LASER SPECKLE BASED SYSTEM\n\n3-331\n\nFUTURE\nTHRUSTS RESEARCH\nIN\nSENSORS\nFuture work in research sensors will be strongly influenced by new materials\nbeing developed for turbine engine components. These materials are expected\nto be in the forms of metal and ceramic matrix composites. Both the nature of\nthe materials and the significantly\nhigher hot section temperatures that these\nmaterials are expected to make possible will influence our sensor work. If\nthin-film sensors are to be applied to these materials, methods for producing\nsuitable insulating films must be developed. As surface temperatures rise,\nthe temperature limits of available sensor materials will force more emphasis\non remote, noncontact sensing techniques. In addition, we will continue to\nsearch for new sensor materials with higher temperature capabilities.\nWork\nhas already started in these directions relative to surface temperature,\nstrain, and heat flux measurementson ceramic and ceramic matrix composite\nmaterials.\n\nMAJOR DRIVER:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PROGRAM TO DEVELOP MATERIALS TO OPERATE AT SIGNIFICANTLY\nSECTION TEMPERATURES--METAL\n\nAND CERAMICMATRIX\n\nHIGHER HOT\n\nCOMPOSITES\n\nEFFECT ON SENSOR PROGRAMS:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY FOR THINFILM\n\nSENSORS ON NEW SUBSTRATE MATERIALS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DEVELOP SENSOR MATERIALS FOR HIGHER TEMPERATURE RANGES\n\xe2\x80\xa2 IMPROVE REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES\n\n3-332\n\nREFERENCES\nAtkinson,\nW.H.,\nTemperature\n\nand Strange,\nR.R.,\nHeat Flux Sensors,"\n\n1982,\nNASA\n\n"Development\nCR-165618.\n\nof Advanced\n\nHigh-\n\nAtkinson,\nW.H.,\nHobart,\nH.F., and Strange,\nR.R.,\n1983, "Advanced\nHigh Temperature Heat Flux Sensors,"\nProceedings\nof the 38th Instrument\nSociety\nof\nAmerica\nConference_\nAdvances\nin Instrumentation,\nVol.\n38, Part 2,_ Instrument Society\nof America,\npp. 1457-1479.\nAtkinson,\nHeat\nAtkinson,\n\nW.H., Cyr,\nFlux Sensor\n\nAtkinson,\nHeat\n\nR.R.,\n1984, "Turbine\nBlade and Vane\nI - Final Report,"\nNASA CR-168297.\n\nCyr,\n\nM.A.,\n\nR.R.,\n\nHeat\n\nW.H.,\n\nTemperature\nCR-174973.\n\nM.A., and Strange,\nDevelopment,\nPhase\n\nFlux\n\nW.H., Cyr,\nFlux Sensor\n\nand\n\nStrange,\n\nSensors,\n\nPhase\n\nM.A., and Strange,\nDevelopment,\nPhase\n\nII\n\n1985a,\n\n"Development\n\n- Verification\n\nof High-\n\nTesting,"\n\nNASA\n\nR.R.,\n1985b,\n"Turbine\nBlade and Vane\nII - Final Report,"\nNASA CR-].74995.\n\nBudhani,\nR.C., Prakash,\nS., and Bunshah,\nR.F.,\nSensors\nfor Gas Turbine\nEngines:\nProblems\nand Tech.
