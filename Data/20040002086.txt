b'Oh, Develop\nStories in ASK Magazine demonstrdte that career development is rarely\nsomething successjid project managers consider just a phase of their career\n\nIN A MATURE VIEW OF THE SUBJECT, CAREER DEVELOPMENT\n\nis not simply four years of college or a week at training,\nculminating in a diploma or a certificate to hang on an\noffice wall. That\xe2\x80\x98s why we wanted to take a broad look\nat career development in this issue of ASK. Take for\nexample, Dr. Gerald Mulenburg\xe2\x80\x99s contribution, \xe2\x80\x9dFly on\nthe Wall.\xe2\x80\x9d When Mulenburg and other members of a\nknowledge-sharing group at Ames were invited to\nobserve an upcoming project review, Mulenburg\nthought it would be interesting to learn how another\nproject does its reviews.\nNote that Mulenburg is no \xe2\x80\x9dfresh out\xe2\x80\x9d who\xe2\x80\x99s never\nattended a NASA project review. Not only has he been\nthrough a fair share of them as the reviewed, he has also\nbeen on the other side of the table as a reviewer. This\nexperienced project manager recognizes that at any\nstage of ;1 career there is room to grow and develop\none\xe2\x80\x99s repertoire.\nToo often people associate career development with\ntextbooks and rote classroom training, far removed from\nproject life. But classroom training need not be like this,\nas you\xe2\x80\x99ll find in our Special Feature, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Enterprise\nProject\xe2\x80\x9d by Wendy Dolci, which sprung out of an APPL\nAdvanced Project Management class in July 2003 at\nAmes Research Center.\nIn addition to Dolci, some of her classmates\ncontribute to the story. Mike Sander of the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory, project manager for the Mars\nScience Laboratory mission, who provided the assignment on which the story is based, also has a cameo in\nthe story. We think Dolci\xe2\x80\x99s story is an inspiring example\nof what classroom training can be if it\xe2\x80\x99s approached\nimaginatively and made to serve a practical purpose.\nAnother story from Ames, by Frank Larsen, takes a\ndifferent twist on career development. At the annual\n\nExperimental Aircraft Association Fly-in in Oshkosh,\nWisconsin, Larsen represented Ames at a NASA booth.\nWhile there, Larsen met a colleague from Glenn\nResearch Center.\nMonths later on a project with a quick turnaround,\nhe remembered his colleague from Glenn who had\nequipment that might help Larsen save time and money\non his project. Although they had never worked together\nand they had to unravel a lot of red tape before they could\ncollaborate, they managed a way to get the job done.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the fun part of the story, but we think\n\xe2\x80\x9cStaying o n the Lookout\xe2\x80\x9d also depicts the unassuming\nrelationship between serendipity and career development. Much the way it does in Tom Young\xe2\x80\x99s story,\n\xe2\x80\x9cClass Act,\xe2\x80\x9d when the opportunity to go back to school\ncoincided with Young\xe2\x80\x99s working for a manager enlightened enough to value the personal development of\nteam members.\nThere are other stories in this issue that deal\ndirectly with this theme of career development. Then\nthere are others in which it is less explicit. But if you\ntake the view that career development happens all the\ntime, and is as necessary to your survival as breathing,\nthen you can read almost any story in ASK with your\ncareer development in mind. In that case, all the best,\nand so then-start developing.\n0\n\nASK 15 FOR PRACTITIONERS BY PRACTITIONERS\n\n3\n\n'
