b'3}N9O- 18463\nTRANSIENT PRESSURE TEST ARTICLE TEST PROGRAM \r\nBy: Charles M. Vibbart, NASA/MSFC\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Transient Pressure Test Article (TPTA) test program is being conducted at a new test facility\nlocated in the East Test Area at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\'s (NASA\'s) Marshall\nSpace Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama.\nThis facility, along with the special test equipment\n(STE) required for facility support, was constructed\nspecifically to test and verify the sealing capability of the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM)\nfield, igniter, and nozzle joints. The test article\nconsists of full scale RSRN hardware loaded with\ninert propellant and assembled in a short stack configuration. The TPTA is pressurized by igniting a\npropellant cartridge capable of inducing a pressure\nrise rate which simulates the ignition transient\nthat occurs during launch. Dynamic loads are\napplied during the pressure cycle to simulate external tank attach (ETA) Strut loads present on the ETA\nring. Sealing ability of the redesigned joints is\nevaluated under joint movement conditions produced\nby these combined loads since joint sealing ability\ndepends on seal resilience velocity being greater\nthan gap opening velocity. Also, maximum flight\ndynamic loads are applied to the test article which\nis either pressurized to 600 psia using gaseous\nnitrogen (GN 2 ) or applied to the test article as the\npressure decays inside the test article on the down\ncycle after the ignition transient cycle. This\npaper will present the uniqueness of this new test\nfacility with respect to Its capabilities. In addition, the paper will also touch on both the topic of\ntest effectiveness versus space vehicle flight performance and new aerospace test techniques, as well\nas presenting a comparison between the old SRM\ndesign and the RSRM.\n\nprogram, but some of the test programs mentioned\nabove will be discussed briefly, as required, when\nused in a comparison with TPTA.\nJoint Redesign Task\nFollowing the Challenger accident, the redesign\neffort on the SRM joints became extensive. An SRN\nRedesign Team, identified as RAO1, was formed consisting of NA,SA MSFC personnel from several disciplines involved in the SRM project to obtain the\nneeded expertise. This MSFC team worked closely with\nMTI to develop concepts of improving joint sealing\nperformance of the SRM. After consideration of many\nconcepts, the final design was baselined. This\ndesign implements a capture feature hook which produces an interference fit to stiffen the joint and\nalso incorporates a third 0-ring to enhance joint\nsealing ability. A comparison between the old\ndesign and the redesigned joint is presented in\nFigure 1. The redesign of the nozzle-to-case joint\nincorporates the addition of a third 0-ring known\nas the wiper 0-ring, the addition of radial bolts,\nand aft dome structural modifications to strengthen\nthe joint. Figure 2 shows a comparison between the\nredesign and the previous design.\nThe insulation configuration was also changed to\nprevent hot gases from reaching the field joints.\nThe new design in the field joints is known as the\nJ-seal as shown in Figure 1. Pressurization of the\nJ-seal closes the bondline between the insulation of\ntwo segments during motor operation. The insulation\ndesign in the nozzle-to-case joint has elongated\nvent slots which allow air trapped during the mating\nof the joint to escape without creating blow holes.\nThe insulation in the joint provides an interference\nfit for a tighter bondline.\n\nIntroduction\nAs a result of the Space Shuttle Challenger accident\nin late January of 1986, changes were required in\nthe Space Shuttle Transportation System to enable\nthe resumption of safe space flight. One of the\nmain components requiring extensive, redesign by\nNASA was the Solid Rocket Motor (SRN) joint sealing\nsystem. The Challenger accident resulted from the\nescape of hot gases and flames from the SRM which\nignited the external fuel tank of the Shuttle. The\nSRN is developed and manufactured by Morton Thiokol\nIncorporated (MTI) located in Utah.\nTesting of the redesigned joints is essential to\nverify the performance of the SRN under conditions\nthat simulate a portion of the flight environment.\nA major test \'program was initiated to prove the\noverall integrity of the RSRM which includes full\nscale hardware test programs such as the Joint\nEvaluation Simulator (JES tests, Nozzle Joint\nEvaluation Simulator (NJES) tests, Referee tests,\nfull duration horizontal firing motor tests, Assembly Test Article (ATA) tests, Structural Test\nArticle (STA-3) tests, and the Transient Pressure\nTest Article (TPTA) tests. Several subscale test\nprograms, such as the 70-lb motor tests and 0-ring\nfixture testing, were also initiated to obtain data\nutilizing both a quicker and a lower cost test process. This paper will address the TPTA test\n\nMSFC worked closely with USBI on several components\nof the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). The two of main\nconcern to the TPTA test program are the external\ntank attach (ETA) ring and the aft skirt. The ETA\nring has been changed from a 270-deg design to a\n360-deg design. This full circle design eliminates\nthe ovality of the motor case in the vicinity of the\nETA ring.which was caused by the 270-deg design and\nalso provides additional strength in this area.\nThe new ring has been fully instrumented to obtain\ndata during the strut loading applications of\' TPTA.\nThe aft skirt has also been modified to provide\nadditional strength. Limited data on an unmodified\naft skirt was obtained during TPTA testing; however,\nmost aft skirt evaluation was accomplished in other\ntesting. The STA-3 test program, also conducted at\nMSFC, tested this redesigned aft skirt and the 360deg ETA ring to 140-percent design loads to obtain\ndata to verify the redesign.\nTest Objectives\nThe main objective of the TPTA test program is to\nprovide data to verify the sealing capability of the\nRSRM field joints, the nozzle-to-case joint, and the\nigniter joint. Test data is also obtained for the\nnew 360-deg ETA ring and limited data on the unmodified aft skirt as stated previously. Instrumented\nstuds secure the test article to the four flight\n\nApproved for public release; distribution is unlimited.\n35\n\n1RECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT\n\nFILMED\n\nFluorocarbon\nSecondary\n0-ring\n\n0-ring\nSize and Groove\nChanged\n\nFluorocarbon\nPrimary\n0-ring\n\nCustom\nShims\t\nAdded\n\nGrease\nBead\nShim\t\n\nThird 0-ring Added\nInterference Fit\nCapture Latch Added\nJ-Seal\nDeflection\nRelief Flap\nin\nInsulation\nAdded\n\nFilled\nInsulation Gap\n\n-\n\nLonger\nPins and\nNew Retention\nBand Added\n\nSealed\nInsulation\nIntroduced\n\nzinc Chromate\nPutty\nRedesign\n\nSTS 51 -L Design\t\nFigure 1.

The TPTA test program also\nallows for the demonstration of . the assembly/\ndisassembly and reusability of the redesigned joints\nalong with demonstrating the adequacy of assembly/\ndisassembly tooling, procedures, and inspections.\nTraining of personnel for the stacking of flight\nhardware is also accomplished during this test program. The test program is a joint effort between\nMTI, USBI, Wyle Laboratories and MSFC, along with\nvarious subcontractors required for specific tasks.\nMSFC has primary responsibility for test implementation.\n\n36\n\nTest Article Configuration\nThe TPTA consists of full-scale RSRN hardware\nassembled in a short-stack configuration as shown\nin Figure 3. The hardware is comprised of two baseline capture feature cylinder segments, forward and\naft domes, ETA stiffener segment, nozzle fixed\nhousing, and a modified flight igniter. Inert propellant is used in lieu of live propellant and is\nprotected from burning with insulation. The aft\nskirt, the 360-deg ETA ring, and the holddown studs\nare also a part of the test configuration. Four\nflight holddown posts support the test article\nduring testing.\n\nThe TPTA test provides for a short duration, hotf ire test with dynamic loads application during an\nignition transient condition and a maximum flight\ndynamic load condition. Figure 4 shows a comparison\nbetween a complete SRM and the short stack test\narticle used in this test program. In order to\nsimulate the weight associated with the other shuttle\ncomponents and provide appropriate dynamic boundary\nconditions, a one million pound dead weight is\nattached on top of the test article using a simulated forward skirt. The test joints associated\nwith the test article include two field joints, the\nnozzle-to-case joint, and the igniter joint. The\nfactory joints and non-test joints are also monitored during testing and their performance is\nevaluated following testing. All joints can be\nthermally conditioned prior to initiation of the\ntest.\n\nJOINT\n\ncOsioll\ntTYP 3\n\nA field joint enables the mating of two casting\nsegments with the assembly being accomplished in the\nfield. A factory joint provides the mated connection of two segments to form a casting segment which\nis assembled at the factory prior to propellant\ncasting. Potential leak paths are more likely to\noccur in field joints since the insulation and propellant in two segments mated in the field are not\ncontinuous across the joint bond as is the case with\nthe factory joint. Therefore, gap movements in the\nRSRM have a worse effect on field joints than factory joints due to the potential of the joint bond\nopening during motor operation and allowing\' hot gas\nto reach the joint.\n\np1\nETA\nSTRUT\nLOADS\n\npa\n\nFigure 3.

"Full Up" SRE and TPTA Comparison\n\n37\n\npropellant cartridge, consisting of a multiple fin\ndesign, as shown in Figure 5, is used to induce the\npressure rise rate and magnitude inside the test\narticle which closely simulates the ignition transient that occurs during launch. Propellant strips\nare bonded around the two field joints which\nassures hot gas flow to these joints. The pressure\nrise rate is a function of the surface area of the\nexposed propellant on the cartridge. The design\nincorporates 45 fins with propellant bonded to each\nside of the fins to obtain the required surface area\nneeded to produce the ignition transient rise rate.\nThe total propellant weight inside the test article\ndetermines the maximum expected operating pressure\n(MEOP). The propellant strips bonded at the field\njoints are designed in conjunction with the propellant cartridge to provide the desired MEOP for each\ntest.\nA\n\nand provides movable platforms to access specific levels associated with the joints on the SRM. The\nload tower, located next to the access tower, reacts\nthe dynamic loading induced on the test article\nthrough the three hydraulically operated load lines\nwhich are shown in Figure 7. The hydraulic system\nIs mounted on the top of the load tower. Existing\nbuildings are used for test facility support such as\ninstrumentation and test control.\nrefurbishment facility, located adjacent to the\ntest stand, provides capability for test article preparation and insulation repair during recycle\nbetween tests. The test article is disassembled and\ncarefully inspected prior to and after the segments\nare moved to the refurbishment facility. Segments\nare loaded into the facility, which has removable\nroof panels, using the special facility crane which\nis capable of destacking the test article. The test\narticle is cleaned of material such as charred insulation and is then repaired for the next test. Instrumentation and propellant layup are other functions\nperformed in this facility. The facility is environmentally controlled for application of adhesives and\nother materials.\nA\n\nThe TPTA test facility contains several systems\nwhich perform various functions in support of testing. These systems, which are referred to as STE,\ninclude the GN 2 quench/purge system, the missile\ngrade air system, the hydraulic system, the joint\nconditioning system, the sequencer system, the\nignition system, the camera system, the instrumentation/data acquisition system, the firex system, and\nother small systems.\nThe GN 2 quench/purge system provides a means of\nquenching the TPTA and purging the hot gases from\ninside the test article immediately following the\nhot-fire test. This reduces the amount of work\nneeded to refurbish the test article and thus\nenhances the test turnaround time.\nThe missile grade air system is used to pressurize\nthe SRN for leak check operations when intentional\nflaws do not allow performance of the standard flight\nmotor leak check. This system is also used to purge\nthe test article of any inert gases prior to testing.\n\nFigure 5. Finned Propellant Cartridge\nTest Facility\nThe TPTA facility was constructed with the capability\nof inducing prelaunch, ignition, and flight type\ndynamic, structural, and limited thermal environments\non the test article to evaluate the redesigned joint\nperformance. The TPTA facility, depicted in Figure\n6, is located at NASA MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama,\nand consists of the foundation, access and load\ntowers, support structures, facility crane, support\nbuildings, test stand utilities, a refurbishment\nfacility, and individual systems needed for specific\ntest functions. Four fiight holddown posts, which\nsecure the test article using instrumented studs,\nare attached to a cruciform support structure. The\ncruciform Is a reaction structure comprised of\nwelded steel plate which transfers the loads from\nthe TPTA into the concrete foundation. An access\ntower, which has no structural connection with the\ntest article or the load tower, surrounds the TPTA\n\n38\n\nThe hydraulic system provides power for dynamic loading of the test article through three load lines.\nA programmable Cyber controller is used for the\napplication of selected static and dynamic loading\nprofiles.\nThe facility provides the capability for conditioning\nthe joints to various temperatures. This system is\ncomprised of heating and cooling devices with programmable controllers to maintain the joint temperatures within specified tolerances. Temporary\nshrouds enclose the two field joints and are removable prior to testing for camera viewing. A shroud\n-also encloses the igniter joint which uses expanded\nmissile grade air to cool the joint or heated missile\ngrade air to heat the joint. The nozzle-to-case\njoint incorporates a heating, ventilation, and air\nconditioning (EVAC) system to condition the joint to\nthe desired temperature. Strip heaters are used to\nmaintain the minimum required temperature, usually\n60 degrees, for all nontest joints.\n\nFigure 6. TPTA Test Facility\n\nETA RIW\n\n,1\n\nFigure 7. Hydraulic Load Lines\n\n39\n\nThe facility is also equipped with a programmable\ncontroller used to assure that critical pretest conditions are present and to provide sequencing and\nlogic for orderly control of the test. This controller is known as the sequencer and serves as the\nbrain for the tests.\nThe ignition system interf aces with the sequencer\nand the test stand safe and arm (S&A) device to\nprovide safe/arm and fire/abort commands to the TPTA\ngas generator initiator. The system uses a flight\ntype initiator with the S&A device to initiate the\nfiring process of the propellant cartridge.\nTwelve high speed motion picture \'and several documentary movie cameras are positioned around the test\nstand and at various levels to view and document the\ntest operation. The test article and facility is\nhighly instrumented to obtain the necessary data for\nboth RSRM performance and control system feedback.\nInstrumentation data is processed by the instrumentation/data acquisition system which consists\nbriefly of microprocessors, static input units\n(SIUs), data selector units (DSUs), and multiplex\ncabling.\nFire protection is provided by both an on-stand\nfirex system and a remotely-controlled monitor nozzle\nwhich enables the operator to concentrate a stream\nof water on selected targets.\nTest Implementation\nTesting of the TPTA consists of igniting the propellant cartridge, using a flight type igniter, which\ninduces the simulated SRM ignition transient pressure. The required target pressure rise rate differs\nfrom test to test but 141 psi/i0 ms is a typical\nvalue. This rise rate is expected to produce a\nMEOP of approximately 957 psia in 0.6 sec. Dynamic\nloads are initiated by the sequencer during this\npressure cycle. Maximum flight dynamic loads\n(Max Q) are applied at approximately 34 sec following ignition when the pressure inside the test\narticle drops to about 600 psi. Max Q loads are the\nloads present on the ETA struts at the time of\nmaximum dynamic pressure occurring during flight.\nThe Max Q loads can also be applied to the test\narticle following a hot-fire test by pressurizing\nthe TPTA to 600 psi using the facility GN 2 system.\nThe hot gas and pressure are held inside the TPTA\nfor 120 sec to allow the joints to experience the\nsevere heating environment for an extended period of\ntime. At the end of 120 sec, the hot gas is vented\nto the atmosphere through a specially designed vent\npipe for this environment.\nTest Effectiveness\nCurrently, four out of ten scheduled tests have been\ncompleted in the TPTA test program, each test having\nvarious requirements for dynamic loading and joint\nconditioning. Temporary shrouds enclose each test\njoint, including the igniter joint, which allow the\nconditioned medium to either heat or cool the joint\nto the required temperature environment. This capability enables the redesigned joints to be tested\nin a range of environments that a flight motor might\nexperience during launch. Sealing ability of the\nredesigned joints is evaluated under joint movement\nconditions produced by these combined loads since\njoint sealing ability depends on seal resilience\n\n40\n\nvelocity being greater than gap opening velocity.\nThe 0-ring seal resilience is greatly dependent on\ntemperature, thus the capability to condition the\njoints to different temperatures is a key element of\ntest program effectiveness. In the same context,\nvarious dynamic load profiles can be applied to the\ntest article through the ETA ring to verify the\nintegrity of RSRN joint sealing under different\nloading conditions that have been experienced during\nprevious SRN flights.\nSeveral tests have and will be planned in which seals\nand/or insulation layup in the test joints are intentionally flawed so that engineers can evaluate the\nreliability of the redesigned joints under different\nsealing conditions. In some cases the. motor is\nflawed all the way to the secondary 0-ring, thus\ntesting the joint with no redundant seals. Grooved\nflaws are precisely Cut through the insulation to\nthe joint and 0-rings are flawed by reduction in\n0-ring diameter at the flaw location. In cases\nwhere the motor has multiple flaws, the induced\ndefects are purposely aligned to siimilate a worst\ncase situation.\nThe TPTA test facility is unique in its ability to\nsimulate a realistic flight type environment on the\nRSBN test article. Unlike the full duration horizontal motor firings at MTI in Utah, the TPTA test\nfacility tests the redesign in a vertical launch\nposition. This capability, along with the capability\nto add weights to simulate the axial force of missing\nshuttle components, greatly enhance test authenticity. These two loading sources (strut and axial)\nare loads that have not been addressed in either the\nprevious JES tests or in full-duration horizontal\nRSRM testing. The design of the facility incorporates a thrust relief piston which enables the test\narticle to experience an upward thrust similar to\nthat occurring at ignition on the mobile launch\nplatform (MLP) during launch. This thrust applies\nrealistic stresses to the motor case and SItS Components, especially the aft skirt. These loads,\ncoupled with the strut loads applied to the ETA ring,\nprovide a very authentic test configuration.\nTest Results\nFour hot-fire tests have currently been performed at\nthe TPTA test facility. The successful completion\nof these four tests were required prior to the\nresumption of Shuttle flights. The tests were performed utilizing two sets of RSRN hardware in order\nto complete these required tests in the shortest\ntime frame possible. Tests completed thus far\ninclude TPTA Test 1.1 (first hardware set, first\ntest), 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2. A brief summary of the\ntest results found to date will be presented in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\nIn late August through early October of 1987, initial\ntests were performed with a Pathfinder test article\nof non-redesign configuration. The primary objective\nof the Pathfinder tests was to conduct functional\nand procedural tests for verification of the TPTA\ntest facility with respect to the facility/test\narticle interfaces, dynamic strut load application\nand control, GN2 presurization system, joint conditioning system, data acquisition system, and other\nsystem operations. The series of testing did not\ninclude a hot-fire test, but verified the ignition\ncircuit for TPTA Test 1.1. The Pathfinder tests\n\npioved to be very beneficial in preparing the facility for the first test during fabrication and\ndelivery of the first set of redesigned hardware.\nSeveral improvements were made to most systems as a\nresult of this test which ensured that the facility\nwas ready to accept the first RSRM test article for\na hot-fire test. Transportation and handling operations were performed which iestilted in ref inement of\nhandling procedures prior to TPTA Test 1.1. Data\nobtained during static and dynamic load tests were\ncompared to analytical models to better understand\nthe response of the test article in the test\nfacility.\n\nThe cold-gas Max Q test was designated as TPTA test\n1.IA. This test consisted of pressurizing the test\narticle to 612 psia using the facility GM2 system\nand applying the Max Q strut loads to the test\narticle. The load system performed as intended,\napplying the specified load profile with no anomalies. Figure 8 shows the conunanded load profile for\nload line P-8 and the actual profile that was applied\nto the test article. The capture feature primary\n0-rings sealed and did not show any leakage during\nthe cold-gas test. Post-test inspections revealed\nno joint anomalies other than a leak path through\nthe polysulfide adhesive to the wiper 0-ring in the\nnozzle-to-case joint.\n\nTPTA Test 1.1 consisted of a hot-fire test and a\n\ncold-gas Max . Q test. The hot-fire test was conducted on November 19, 1987, with the cold-gas Max Q\ntest following on November 24, 1987. During the\nhot-fire test, strut loads were not applied to the\ntest article due to a malfunction in the loading\nsystem. This malfunction was caused by a broken\nwire supplying critical information back to the\nsequencer which inadvertently resulted in aborted\nloads while ignition of the propellant cartridge was\nnot aborted. This problem was corrected, and a more\nstringent checkout was initiated for systems that\nprovide feedback for critical control of the test\nAnother anomaly experienced during this test was the\nquench injector plug blocking the vent pipe nozzle\nwhich caused the motor to experience a more severe\ntest. The venting of the test article ceased 12 sec\nafter ignition and remained pressurized at approximately 420 psia for roughly 11 mm before an\nauxiliary vent valve was opened. In this static\nhot-firing test, all joint measurements were within.\nthe range of similar tests performed without strut\nloads (JES tests) and were close to .the predicted\nvalues. Hot gases did not get past the J-seal insulation. This test did not have any intentional\nflaws in the joints. The test article performed\nnominally, achieving a maximum pressure of 913.3\npsia at 0.609 sec.\n\nTPTA test 1.2 was successfully tested on February 11,\n\n1988. Two field joints and the nozzle-to-case joint\nhad intentional flaws through the insulation to the\nprimary 0-ring. The flaws through the insulation\nwere purposely aligned with the 0-ring flaws to\nsimulate a worst case situation. Prior to test, the\ntest article was leak tested by pressurizing the\nmotor to 100 psia with GN 2 . All the test joints\nwere conditioned within the required temperature\nrange of 70 to 95\xc2\xb0F, while the nontest joints were\nconditioned to 60\xc2\xb0F minimum for test. Upon ignition\nof the propellant cartridge, representative launch\nloads were applied to the RSRM during the ignition\ntransient period as designed. During this test, hot\ngases were contained inside the test article for 120\nsec providing extended exposure to the joints and\nthen released through the vent pipe.\nThe performance of the RSRN hardware for TPTA test\n1.2 was excellent and all objectives for test were\nmet. The ballistic performance was good and fulfilled its function of creating an accurate pressure\ntransient. Upon the successful application of\ndynamic loading, predictions were confirmed that the\nstrut loads have minimal effects on joint gap deflections.. This supports the findings of TPTA Test 1.IA,\nwhich show that the chamber pressure is the driver\n\n-300\n\n-200\n\n-100\n\n\'C\n\n200\n\n300\n8.6\t\n\n8.8\t\n\n9.0\t\n\n9.2\t\n\n9.4\t\n\n9.6\t\n\n9.8\t\n\n10.0\t\n\n10.2\t\n\n10.4\n\nTINE (SEC)\nFigure 8.

There was no leakage past the\nprimary 0-ring on any joint, and intentional flaws\nperformed as expected as indicated by pressurization\nof the . primary 0-rings in all test joints.\nThe third hot-fire test, TPTA Test 2.1, was conducted\non March 21, 1988. As the test number indicates,\nthis was the first test on the second set of RSRM\nhardware. The test article was intentionally flawed\nin one of the field joints and the nozzle-to-case\njoint allowing the primary 0-rings to be pressurized\nand their sealing ability to be tested. The other\nfield joint consisted of the baseline design with no\nintentional defects. A vent port plug was intentionally flawed to verify the sealing capability of\nthe plug. Field joints were conditioned to 120\n+151-0\xc2\xb0F and the nozzle-to-case joint was conditioned\nto 110 +151-0\xc2\xb0F. All nontest joints were conditioned\nto 75\xc2\xb0F minimum at the time of the test. Ignition\nand presurizatlon performance for this test was\nnominal. Dynamic loads were applied to the test\narticle during the ignition transient period, and\nrepresentative Max Q dynamic loads were applied at\napproximately 34 sec after ignition when the pressure inside the test article decreased to about 600\npsia. Hot gas and pressure were held inside the\nTPTA for 120 sec prior to venting.\nThe RSRM hardware performed flawlessly during TPTA\ntest 2.1 and all the objectives of the test were met.\nThe maximum chamber pressure and pressure rise rate\nwere 8% lower than expected due to GN2 present in\nthe motor chamber prior to test. As a result of\nthis, plans were made to purge the motor of inert\ngas prior to testing in future tests. The test\nsequence was executed as intended, producing both a\nsimulated launch and Max Q loading condition. All\nthe intentional flaws performed as designed, allowing the pressurization of the primary 0-rings in the\nfield joint and the nozzle-to-case joint with no\nleakage. The intentionally flawed vent port plug\nalso maintained a seal during the test. Joint gap\ndeflections were as expected and were similar to\nthose experienced during other short-stack tests,\nthus establishing further confidence In the predictability and repeatability of RSBM joint hardware.\nThe final test completed to date was TPTA Test 2.2\nwhich was successfully fired on May 17, 1988. This\ntest was the worst flawed test of the RSRN performed\nto date in the test program. All test joints were\nintentionally flawed to the last seal, thus testing\nthe RSRM with no redundant seals. These additional\ndefects made leak checking the motor very critical.\nA method of leak checking the motor similar to flight\nmotors was not readily available due to the induced\nflaws. The test article was presurized to 200 psia\nand ultrasound equipment was used to detect any\nleaks. Also, the motor was pressurized to 900 psia\nand grease beads, placed around potential leak paths,\nwere examined for indications of any leakage. These\ntwo tests gave engineers confidence to proceed with\nthe test. New vent port plugs were installed on\nTPTA which involved using a new tool to accurately\nmeasure the plug toles for the installation of these\ncustom vent plugs. The test joints were conditioned\nto 70+151-0\xc2\xb0F prior to the initiation of the test.\nA bead of grease was applied around the potential\nleak paths of the test joints in order to detect any\ngross leaks which might occur during the test. After\nthe initiation of the test, the dynamic launch loads\nwere applied to the test article, and the hot gas\n\n42\n\nand pressure were.contained inside the motor for\n120 sec prior to venting, as in most of the other\nTPTA tests.\n\'All the joints maintained a seal during this test\nwhich verified the capability of the RSRN to seal\nwith no redundant seals. During the test the intentional flaw in the nozzle-to-case joint closed up\nduring the hot-fire test, resulting in this joint\nnot experiencing full motor pressure to the secondary 0-ring. The ballistics and dynamic loading\nsystem performed as designed. Joint deflection data\ncompared well to other tests as was expected.\nTPTA Test Facility Future\nA series of 10 tests were planned for the TPTA test\nfacility to provide the data required to adequately\nverify the integrity of the new redesign. Four of\nthese planned tests, which have been successfully\ncompleted, were required prior to resuming Space\nShuttle flights. Areas of concern for future testing\ninclude additional flaw testing, igniter testing,\nmargin testing, vented joint\' testing, verification\ntesting, and sensitivity testing which are aimed at\nbetter understanding the performance of the RSRM.\nAlso, different ballistic performance is planned to\ntest the effect of various ignition burn rates.\nTPTA Test 1.3, which is the third test on the first\nset of hardware, is scheduled for early August 1988,\nand will include the removal of the metal interference fit on one of the field joints to determine the\nresponse of the test article with this type of\ndefect.\nIn addition to other suggested areas of testing, the\nTPTA test facility, because of its excellent capabilities, has been selected as the facility to test\nand verify the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM).\nThe ASRM will have the capability to lift a heavier\npayload. The contractor selected to design and\nbuild the ASRM will be responsible for modifying the\nfacility for ASRM testing, and also for implementing\nthe tests.\nConclusion\nThe TPTA test program has played a vital role in\nverifying the sealing capability of the redesigned\nSEM. The test facility made it possible to test the\nRSRM under conditions which more realistically simulate prelaunch environments. Unlike the JES tests\nin Utah, the TPTA test program incorporates an aft\nskirt and ETA ring which enables dynamic loading to\nbe applied to the test article to evaluate the effect\nof this loading, along with the axial loads, on both\nthe RSEM and the SRB components. From this testing,\nit was confirmed that the strut loading has minimal\neffect on gap movement which is basically driven by\nthe internal pressure of the motor. This minimal\neffect of strut loading on gap deflection was predicted by developing detailed models for analyzing\nthe RSRM which are compared to the test results.\nTesting greatly enhances the ability to accurately\nbuild analytical models by comparing what was predicted to actual results and then refining the model\nto better understand the performance of the RSRN.\nMeasurement techniques and instrumentation have also\nbeen better understood as a result of this test program. Many lessons on instrumentation placement,\nlimits, installation, and environments have been\n\nlearned which will not only aid in this test program\nbut the expertise will greatly aid other test programs.\nTesting to date has revealed that the RSRM joints do\nseal and maintain the seal during the duration of the\ntest. Since the main objective of .the test program\nwas to obtain test data to verify the sealing capability of the RSRM field, nozzle-to-case, and\nigniter joints, the TPTA program is meeting the\nobjectives. By purposely inducing defects into the\nmotor, engineers have developed greater confidence\nin the sealing ability of the RSRM. The results\nobtained during this test program, combined with\nresults obtained from other redesign test programs,\nhave culminated in qualification of the RSRM sealing\nsystem and paved the way for resumption of safe\nShuttle flights.\n\n43\n\n'
