Image interpretation and automatic digital processing information from LANDSAT data are employed to classify and map the coniferous forests. Radiant temperature data from GOES were compared to temperature readings from the climatological station network. Digital data from LANDSAT is being used to develop techniques for detecting, monitoring, and modeling land surface change. Improved reflectance signatures through spectroradiometry aided in the detection of viral diseases in blueberry fields and vineyards. Soil survey maps from aerial reconnaissance are included as well as information on education, conferences, and awards.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840015909, "id": "d66b3762914f436fa60f21c6df2b0e93", "publicationDate": "1983-05-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840015909.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840015909/downloads/19840015909.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840015909/downloads/19840015909.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840015909/downloads/19840015909.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
