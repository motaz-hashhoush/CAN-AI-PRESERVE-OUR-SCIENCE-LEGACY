This high\nspeed gas source is preferably one which supplies gas\nat supersonic speed and in the preferred embodiment\nconstitutes a small rocket motor. The small rocket\nmotor is located between the fuel storage tank and the\ncombustion chamber with its nozzle directed toward\nthe latter. The high speed exhaust from the small\nrocket motor creates a pressure differential between ,5\nthe storage tanks and the exhaust stream which draws\nthe fuel components from the storage tanks into the\ncombustion chamber.\n\n*"\nFIG. 3 illustrates a third embodiment of this invention in which a single small rocket motor is used to inject separate streams of fuel and oxidizer into the mixing chamber.\nINSCRIPTION OF THF PRFFFRRFn\nFMROniliFNT?\nUMBUUlMtN 1 5>\nFIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of this invention\nwhich can be used for hypergolic or nonhypergolic propellants. The supersonic rocket motor includes the\nbasic rocket motor elements, to wit, an exhaust nozzle\n1, a combustion chamber 2, propellant storage tanks 3\nand 4, and a fuel injection means 5. The injection\nmeans comprises the heart of the invention and ineludes a mixing conduit 6 and a source of high velocity\ngas, such as the small rocket motor 7 illustrated.\nIn operation the exhaust from the small rocket motor\ncreates a pressure differential between the storage\ntanks and the exhaust stream in the mixing conduit 7\nwhich causes the liquid fuel and liquid oxidant to flow\nfrom their respective storage tanks into the mixing conduit where they are entrained in the exhaust gases and\nthen propelled into the combustion chamber at super-\n\n3\n\n3,777,490\n\n4\n\nsonic speeds.
