Its origin is enigmatic, ranging from a major impact event to endogenous processes, either igneous or tectonic. A unique melt rock, the 'Bronzite' Granophyr, occurs in the Vredefort structure as vertical ring dikes along the contact between sedimentary collar and core of Archaean granites, and as vertical dikes extending northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest in the granitic core. The granophyre rocks have an unusual composition and high content of recrystallized sedimentary inclusions compared to common intrusive igneous rocks with similar SiO2 content (61 to 70 percent by weight). The unique nature of the granophyre has been underlined in previous studies and origin hypotheses as an impact melt or as a highly contaminated intrusive mafic magma have also been discussed. We present new results obtained from a recent detailed petrographic and geochemical study of a very large and texturally diverse suite of 'Bronzite' Granophyre, representing all dikes occurring at Vredefort.", "title": "Bronzite Granophyre: New insight on Vredefort", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930000998, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Therriault, A.
