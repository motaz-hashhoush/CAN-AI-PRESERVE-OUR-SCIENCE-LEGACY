b'December 1968\t\n\nBrief 68-10549\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\nNASA Tech Briefs are issued to summarize specific innovations derived from the U.S. space program,\nto encourage their commercial application. Copies are available to the public at 15 cents each\nfrom the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information Springfield, Virginia 22151.\n\nHigh-Torque Precision Stepping Drive\nCam\t\n\nGear\n\nRI U\n\nSwitc\n\nA stepping drive has been designed for precise incremental angular positioning of scale models of spacecraft about a horizontal axis in order to accurately\nmeasure antenna receiving and transmitting characteristics. It replaces an ordinary gearhead drive which\nhas proven inadequate in precision and torque output\nfor the intended purpose.\nIn operation the stepping drive functions in the following manner. The base is attached to the model\nstructure. Throughout 180 0 , the assembly shown\n\nabove operates in 60\xc2\xb0 increments as shown in the four\nsketches shown overleaf. At starting position, the gear\nis locked and held in precise position by plunger 2.\nThe cam now begins a 180\xc2\xb0 clockwise rotation. During the first 60\xc2\xb0 , the cam shifts plunger I to the left,\nhalfway into the space between two teeth as shown\nin 2. During the second 60 1 , the cam withdraws plunger 2 completely from the gear. The final 60\xc2\xb0 rotation\nmoves plunger I all the way to the left, which, in turn,\nby wedge action rotates the gear about the angle ct/2.\n(continued overleal)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nUpon completion of 1800 rotation, the cam is stopped\nby the limit switch. Plunger I is now the gear in precise position after travel of exactly 2 0 . Thus, it is seen\nthat a 1800 cam movement results in 2\xc2\xb0=a/2 of gear\nmovement.\nNotes:\nI. Precise positioning of the gear is assurred by\nspring-loaded plungers and, due to the small wedge\nangle of 24\xc2\xb0, the plungers are self-locking.\n2.
