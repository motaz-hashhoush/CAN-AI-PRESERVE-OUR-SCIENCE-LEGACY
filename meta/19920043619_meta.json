Recently, limited experimental data has become available from an experiment with a generic nozzle/afterbody model in a hypersonic wind tunnel. The present paper presents full three-dimensional solutions obtained with the implicit Navier-Stokes solver, FL3D, for the baseline model and a version of the model with side extensions. Analysis of the computed flow clearly shows the complex 3-D nature of the flow, critical flow features, and the effect of side extensions on the plume flow development. Flow schematics appropriate for the conditions tested are presented for the baseline model and the model with side extensions. The computed results show excellent agreement with experimental shadowgraph and with surface pressure measurements. The computed and experimental surface oil-flows show the same features but may be improved by appropriate turbulence modeling.", "title": "Single expansion ramp nozzle simulations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T14:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920043619, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ruffin, Stephen M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "736906c9257f4a8ca853a8c62ee529a2"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920043619, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Venkatapathy, Ethiraj"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "1780e34a3c9c45f289fa18e238e0edb8"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920043619, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lee, Seung-Ho"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "eecfd0f583fc4539a8f67eaa569dc221"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19920043619, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Keener, Earl R."}, "organization": {"name": "Eloret Institute", "location": "Palo Alto, CA, United States"}}, "id": "cb0990253c21403e9d45a925d1368b34"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19920043619, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Spaid, Frank W."}, "organization": {"name": "McDonnell Douglas Research Laboratories", "location": "Saint Louis, MO, United States"}}, "id": "f9c4c09562d94271a0f9b7a22b9212c2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920043619, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920043619, "id": "b2fd3a3529854a71af986815709f6a4b", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
