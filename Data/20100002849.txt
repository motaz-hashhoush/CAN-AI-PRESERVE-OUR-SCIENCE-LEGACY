b'Technology Focus: Sensors\nMiniature Intelligent Sensor Module\nThis unit performs signal-conditioning, data-processing, and health-monitoring functions.\nStennis Space Center, Mississippi\nAn electronic unit denoted the Miniature Intelligent Sensor Module performs sensor-signal-conditioning functions and local processing of sensor\ndata. The unit includes four channels of\nanalog input/output circuitry, a processor, volatile and nonvolatile memory,\nand two Ethernet communication ports,\nall housed in a weathertight enclosure.\nThe unit accepts AC or DC power. The\nanalog inputs provide programmable\ngain, offset, and filtering as well as shunt\ncalibration and auto-zeroing. Analog\noutputs include sine, square, and triangular waves having programmable frequencies and amplitudes, as well as programmable amplitude DC.\nOne innovative aspect of the design of\nthis unit is the integration of a relatively\npowerful processor and large amount of\nmemory along with the sensor-signal-\n\nconditioning circuitry so that sophisticated computer programs can be used\nto acquire and analyze sensor data and\nestimate and track the \xe2\x80\x9chealth\xe2\x80\x9d of the\noverall sensor-data-acquisition system of\nwhich the unit is a part. The unit includes calibration, zeroing, and signalfeedback circuitry to facilitate health\nmonitoring. The processor is also integrated with programmable logic circuitry in such a manner as to simplify\nand enhance acquisition of data and\ngeneration of analog outputs.\nA notable unique feature of the unit is\na cold-junction compensation circuit in\nthe back shell of a sensor connector.\nThis circuit makes it possible to use Ktype thermocouples without compromising a housing seal.\nReplicas of this unit may prove useful\nin industrial and manufacturing settings\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 especially in such large outdoor facilities as refineries. Two features can be\nexpected to simplify installation: the\nweathertight housings should make it\npossible to mount the units near sensors,\nand the Ethernet communication capability of the units should facilitate establishment of communication connections\nfor the units.\nThis work was done by Russell S.

Although these modules are now being designed specifically for use on rocket-engine test stands, it is anticipated that\nthey could also readily be designed to be\nincorporated into health-monitoring\nsubsystems of such diverse engineering\nsystems as spacecraft, aircraft, land vehicles, bridges, buildings, power plants,\noilrigs, and defense installations.\nThe figure is a simplified block diagram of the \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d sensor module. The\nanalog sensor readout signal is\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, July 2007\n\nprocessed by the ADC, the digital output\nof which is fed to the microprocessor. By\nmeans of a standard RS-232 cable, the\nmicroprocessor is connected to a local\n\nSensor\n\nADC\n\npersonal computer (PC), from which\nsoftware is downloaded into a randomaccess memory in the microprocessor.\nThe local PC is also used to debug the\n\nMicroprocessor\n\nRemote\nPC\n\nModule\n\nLocal PC\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cSmart\xe2\x80\x9d Sensor Module is programmed by use of the local PC and thereafter operated by the remote PC. In addition to preprocessed sensory data, the module generates an indication of the reliability of the data (and, hence, of the health of the sensor).\n\n5\n\nsoftware. Once the software is running,\nthe local PC is disconnected and the\nmodule is controlled by, and all output\ndata from the module are collected by, a\nremote PC via an Ethernet bus. Several\n\xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d sensor modules like this one\ncould be connected to the same Ethernet bus and controlled by the single remote PC.\nThe software running in the microprocessor includes driver programs for\noperation of the sensor, programs that\nimplement self-assessment algorithms,\nprograms that implement protocols for\ncommunication with the external computer(s), and programs that implement\nevolutionary methodologies to enable\nthe module to improve its performance\n\nover time. The design of the module and\nof the health-monitoring system of which\nit is a part reflects the understanding that\nthe main purpose of a health-monitoring\nsystem is to detect damage and, therefore, the health-monitoring system must\nbe able to function effectively in the presence of damage and should be capable of\ndistinguishing between damage to itself\nand damage to the system being monitored. A major benefit afforded by the\nself-assessment algorithms is that in the\noutput of the module, the sensor data indicative of the health of the engineering\nsystem being monitored are coupled with\na confidence factor that quantifies the degree of reliability of the data. Hence, the\noutput includes information on the\n\nhealth of the sensor module itself in addition to information on the health of the\nengineering system being monitored.\nThis work was done by Ajay Mahajan of\nSouthern Illinois University for Stennis Space\nCenter.\nInquiries concerning rights for its commercial use should be addressed to:\nSouthern Illinois University at Carbondale\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering\nand Energy Processes\nCarbondale, IL 62901\nAttn: Dr. Ajay Mahajan\n(618)453-7007\nmahajan@engr.siu.edu\nRefer to SSC-00242, volume and number\nof this NASA Tech Briefs issue, and the\npage number.\n\nPortable Apparatus for Electrochemical Sensing of Ethylene\nConcentrations between 5 and 5,000 ppb can be measured.\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA small, lightweight, portable apparatus based on an electrochemical sensing\nprinciple has been developed for monitoring low concentrations of ethylene in\nair. Ethylene has long been known to be\nproduced by plants and to stimulate the\ngrowth and other aspects of the development of plants (including, notably,\nripening of fruits and vegetables), even\nat concentrations as low as tens of parts\nper billion (ppb). The effects are magni-\n\n(A)\n\nfied in plant-growth and -storage chambers wherein ethylene can accumulate.\nThere is increasing recognition in agriculture and related industries that it is\ndesirable to monitor and control ethylene concentrations in order to optimize\nthe growth, storage, and ripening of\nplant products. Hence, there are numerous potential uses for the present apparatus in conjunction with equipment for\ncontrolling ethylene concentrations.\n\n(B)\n\nThe ethylene sensor is of a thick-film\ntype with a design optimized for a low\ndetection limit. The sensor includes a\nnoble metal sensing electrode on a chip\nand a hydrated solid-electrolyte membrane that is held in contact with the\nchip. Also located on the sensor chip are\na counter electrode and a reference\nelectrode. The sensing electrode is held\nat a fixed potential versus the reference\nelectrode. Detection takes place at ac-\n\n(C)\n\nThe Sensor Chip and Solid-Electrolyte Membrane are packaged together in a housing that contains airflow channels and a reservoir for water to keep the\nmembrane wet. In the illustrated design, (A) the sensor chip is shown in its holder with its three electrical lead pins and (B) the upper portion of the sensor housing is shown with the water reservoir and slots to hydrate Nafion (or equivalent) membrane, which is placed over the sensor chip. The assembled\nsensor ready for installation in the ethylene monitor is shown in (C). It measures 4 by 4 by 2.2 cm.\n\n6\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, July 2007\n\n'
