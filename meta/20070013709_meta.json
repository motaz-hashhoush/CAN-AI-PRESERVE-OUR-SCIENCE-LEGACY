Simulation results show that the presence of a magnetic field may change the properties of the shock interface between the tenuous, overpressured jet (V(sub j) (sup z)) flowing tangentially to a dense external medium. Magnetic fields can lead to more efficient acceleration of the jet, in comparison to the pure-hydrodynamic case. A poloidal magnetic field (B(sup z)), tangent to the interface and parallel to the jet flow, produces both a stronger outward moving shock and inward moving rarefaction wave. This leads to a large velocity component normal to the interface in addition to acceleration tangent to the interface, and the jet is thus accelerated to a larger Lorentz factors than those obtained in the pure-hydrodynamic case. In contrast, a strong toroidal magnetic field (B(sup y)), tangent to the interface but perpendicular to the jet flow, also leads to stronger acceleration tangent to the shock interface relative to the pure-hydrodynamic case, but to a lesser extent than found for the poloidal case due to the fact that the velocity component normal to the shock interface is now much smaller. Overall, the acceleration efficiency in the toroidal case is less than that of the poloidal case but both geometries still result in higher Lorentz factors than the pure-hydrodynamic case. Thus, the presence and relative orientation of a magnetic field in relativistic jets can have a significant influence on the hydrodynamic boost mechanism studied by Aloy & Rezzolla (2006).", "title": "A Magnetohydrodynamic Boost for Relativistic Jets", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T22:32:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20070013709, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mizuno, Yosuke"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "775d0819c7414495b25e1c228943e99f"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20070013709, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hardee, Philip"}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama Univ.", "location": "Tuscaloosa, AL, United States"}}, "id": "6438b9eb20744bf599a9fab25395ee3c"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20070013709, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hartmann, dieter"}, "organization": {"name": "Clemson Univ.", "location": "SC, United States"}}, "id": "c6512960fd1a46f3a5c77cf580b9e0f4"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 20070013709, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nishikwa, Ken-Ichi"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "af5b9dec3a284906a715a39f56d57cff"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 20070013709, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Zhang, Bing"}, "organization": {"name": "Nevada Univ.", "location": "Las Vegas, NV, United States"}}, "id": "2b0577915ff14ae2a8cde57f93ffd0f6"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070013709, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070013709, "id": "0175cf5abc1c450584d5a91156654114", "publicationDate": "2006-12-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
