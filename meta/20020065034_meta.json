Through the SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research) program, ACR developed a high pressure and temperature fused deposition system, a prototyping system that is known as extrusion freeform fabrication. This system is useful in manufacturing prosthetics. ACR also developed a three-dimensional rapid prototyping process in which physical models are quickly created directly from computer generated models. Marshall Space Flight Center also contracted ACR to fabricate a set of ceramic engines to be appraised for a solar thermal rocket engine test program.", "title": "Prototyping the Future", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020065034, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020065034, "isbn": "0-16-049737-X", "id": "aefdd068387647af8ec201fc1c5b433a", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1998", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020065034.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020065034/downloads/20020065034.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020065034/downloads/20020065034.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020065034/downloads/20020065034.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
