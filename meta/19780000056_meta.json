With technique, spectrum of main bank of lamps is measured and stored in computer memory along with emission characteristics of commonly available phosphors. Computer then calculates ratio of green and blue intensities for each phosphor according to manufacturer's specifications and plots them as coordinates on graph. Same ratios are calculated for measured spectrum. Once proper mix is determined, it is applied as coating to fluorescent tubing.", "title": "Custom blending of lamp phosphors", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T13:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780000056, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Klemm, R.
