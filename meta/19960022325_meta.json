The magnitude and complexity of low-level details is often enough to discourage many users of turbulence data wishing to study more important, higher-level fluid dynamical questions. These same complexities are often a practical barrier to simulation experts who develop, verify and maintain the codes which generate this data. Future fluids codes, with high resolution and complex geometries, are likely to involve far more coding complexity. The research--the design and implementation of the Tensoral computer language--aims to greatly ease the coding of today's simulation and post-processing codes and at the same time provide a general computational tool for future simulations.", "title": "Tensoral Present and Future", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:42:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960022325, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dresselhaus, Eliot"}, "organization": {"name": "Stanford Univ.", "location": "CA United States"}}, "id": "745ca08deb3145529a7c510c8e5516c2"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960022325, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960022325, "id": "06884f0ffeda4a6d89d29201aeef058f", "publicationName": "Center for Turbulence Research Annual Research Briefs: 1995", "publicationDate": "1995-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19960022293, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Annual Research Briefs: 1995", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960022325.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960022325/downloads/19960022325.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960022325/downloads/19960022325.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960022325/downloads/19960022325.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
