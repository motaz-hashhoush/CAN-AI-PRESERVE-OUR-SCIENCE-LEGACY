A SpiderBot at the present\nstage of development is designed\nprimarily to demonstrate that it\ncan crawl on a flexible rectangular mesh (in micro-gravity) and\nsecondarily that it can walk on\nflat surfaces and assemble simple\nstructures.

This system was developed for\noriginal use in measuring the thrust exerted by a rocket engine mounted on\nthe floating frame, but can just as well\nbe used in other force-measurement\napplications.\nThis system offers several advantages\nover prior thrust-measurement systems\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, September 2008\n\nbased on mechanical support by flexures and/or load cells:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The system includes multiple active\nmagnetic bearings for each degree of\nfreedom, so that by selective use of\none, some, or all of these bearings, it\nis possible to test a given article over\na wide force range in the same fixture, eliminating the need to transfer the article to different test fixtures to obtain the benefit of\nfull-scale accuracy of different forcemeasurement devices for different\nforce ranges.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Like other active magnetic bearings,\nthe active magnetic bearings of this system include closed-loop control subsystems, through which the stiffness\nand damping characteristics of the\nmagnetic bearings can be modified\nelectronically.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The design of the system minimizes or\neliminates cross-axis force-measurement errors.
