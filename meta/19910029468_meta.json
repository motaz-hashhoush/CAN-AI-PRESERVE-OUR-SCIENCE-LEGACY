Schemes for the automated production of low-technology products that are likely to be desired in large quantities in the early stages of any large-scale space activity are identified and developed. This paper summarizes the research program, concentrating upon the production of (1) propellants, both cryogenic and storable, (2) volatiles such as water, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide for use in life-support systems (3) structural metals, and (4) refractories for use in aerobrakes and furnace linings.", "title": "Extraterrestrial resource utilization for economy in space missions", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T20:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910029468, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lewis, J.
