NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is\nresponsible for design and development of the spacecraft, vehicle, and ground systems, for\nlaunch operations, for initial spacecraft checkor;t in orbit, for spacecraft evaluatiop, and\nfor interferometer tracking. ESSA is responsible for the operational phase of each spacecraft, including determination of need for replacement; for operation of the CDA stations\nand ESSA communication lines; and for acquiring, handling, and processing spacecraftacquired data. ESSA is responsible for all funding and for overall system evaluation and\nmanagement\n\n.\n\nThis Mission Operations Plan describes the execution of NASA responsibilities and the\nnecessary interfaces with ESSA. The ESSA plan for its TOS activities will be published\nseparately by ESSA.\nT o meet ESSA\'s requirements for obtaining meteorological data from the entire globe on\na daily basis, TOS will have two operational spacecraft in circular 750-nm sun-synchronous, near-polar orbits, with launches at intervals of approximately 3 months. The orbit\nwill be 78.84 degrees retrograde with an orbital period of 113.5 minutes. The spacecraft\nwill be spin-stabilized and magnetically torqued t o a wheel attitude, so that the spin axis\nwill be normal t o the plane of the orbit and the radially mounted cameras will view the\nearth once each spacecraft revolution. The orbital plane will precess easterly about 1\ndegree a day at the same rate as the earth-sun line.\nThe first TOS spacecraft, weighing about 285 lbs., carried two automatic picture transmission (APT) cameras and was launched on February 28, 1966, into an 0900 hour (descending node) orbit. The second spacecraft, weighing about 316 lbs., will have two\nsystem and will be launched\nadvanced vidicon camera systems (AVCS) and an infrared (IR)\ninto a 1500 hour (ascending node) orbit. The 750-nm altitude allows full global coverage\nwith one camera; therefore, two cameras provide full system redundancy.\nThe first launch was from the Eastern Test Range (ETR); the second and following\nlaunches will be from the Western Test Range (WTR). The launch vehicle is the Improved Delta, DSV-3E.\nBased conservatively upon the average lifetime of the TIROS spacecraft, the life expectancy of TOS spacecraft is 6 months, with a minimum of 3 months. Therefore, alternate\nconfigurations of the TOS spacecraft (APT, AVCS, APT, AVCS) will be made available\nby the contractor every 3 months. The objective, however, is t o launch a replacement\nspacecraft within approximately a month after ESSA\'s decision to launch.\nThe spacecraft will be commanded and meteorological and spacecraft data will be acquired\nstations in Fairbanks, Alaska (GILMOR), and\nby Command and Data Acquisition (CDA)\nWallops Station, Va. (WALOMS). The combination of WALOMS and GILMOR provides\ncomplete global coverage each day. All spacecraft data will be sent by data link and teletype to ESSA\'s National Environmental Satellite Center (NESC) at Suitland, Md., for\nengineering evaluation and for analysis and dissemination of meteorological data to the\nmeteorological community. Data will also be sent to GSFC for spacecraft checkout and\nevaluation.

TEC is responsible for the checkout and evaluation of newly launched spacecraft. TEC may also be requested by TOC to take control\nof ailing spacecraft and may resume control of spacecraft which TOC considers no longer\noperatid.\n\nTOC is responsible for spacecraft operation after successful completion of checkout and\nfor operation of the CDA stations and ESSA communications equipment and links. The\ncomplementary functions of the two centers require coordination of their operations and\na reliable mutual reporting system.\nAn outline of TOC and TEC responsibilities and TOC/TEC interfaces are given here;\ndetailed responsibilities are described in Parts III and V.\n1.1 TOC RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nTOC, the central operations control center for "OS, is an element o the Satellite Operaf\ntions Division at NESC. TOC equipment and layout are described in Appendix F. TOC\nwill be responsible for operational control o the entire system, on a 24-hour-a-day,\nf\n\'I-day-a-week basis.

The launch and checkout operation will be accomplished by\nthe GSFC/TEC staff,supplemented by one key TOC individual per shift and by the TOS\nevaluation team.\n\nSystem performance will be evaluated by the TOS Evaluation Engineer, assisted by two\nevaluation engineers and a data clerk.\n1.2.1 PRELAUNCH OPERATIONS\nBefore each launch TEC will conduct engineering tests to check the CDA stations, simulated command programs, a 5-day activation plan, and a coordinated readiness countdown,\nas detailed elsewhere in this plan.\n1.2.2 LAUNCH, INITIAL MANEWER, AND CHECKOUT\nTEC will operate as the spacecraft control center for the checkout of each new TOS as\ndescribed in Part III. Specifically, TEC will:\n1.2.2.1 Assess and evaluate TOS performance on a realtime basis.\n1.2.2.2 Direct t o the appropriate system manager or the Project Manager all information\no r summary of data relative to the malfunction or nonroutine operation of the system.\n1.2.2.3 Determine the spacecraft attitude from V-head horizon sensor data and the digital\nsolar aspect indicator (DSAI).\n1.2.2.4 Coordinate with TOC a long-term schedule of station readouts based on operation\nof spacecraft in orbit. This schedule will be used as a guide for CDA station operations.\n1.2.2.5 Prepare and transmit t o TOC a weekly prediction of all possible CDA satellite\ncontacts.\n1.2.2.6 Originate and transmit to TOC the specific command programs and station\ninterrogation schedules for daily operations, based on:\n0\n\nAnalyses of predictions processed from the computing center as to locations of\nsuitable photographic areas and times of passes over CDA stations\n\n0\n\nAnalyses of programming requests from NESC o r other agencies\n\n0\n\nAnalyses of attitude tracking requirements\n\n0\n\nAnalyses of spacecraft power\n\n0\n\nAnalyses of CDA station status\n\nII- 2\n\n1.2.2.7 Program the magnetic attitude and spin control subsystems based upon all available attitude and spin information. Information of the effects of changes in the spacecraft\nattitude and spin because of programming will normally be transmitted t o Toc at least\ntwo days in advance of the proposed change.\n1.2.2.8 Transmit changes to the program and operating instructions to TOC;program\nand operating instructions changes may be communicated to the CDA stations via telephone if there are less than two hours before implementation.\n1.2.2.9\n\nEnsure the acquisition and timely transmission of all usable data to TQC.\n\n1.2.2.10 Provide TOC the following data, updated as required, to be used as a guide in the\npreparation of requests for TOS television coverage (with an information copy to GNET):\n0\n\nAttitude world map (ATMAPW), magnetic attitude prediction (MGAPW) data, and\nequator crossings\n\n0\n\nLimiting factors that apply to interrogation of the spacecraft and acquisition of data:\nSlant range or look angles from the CDA station antenna to the spacecraft\nCDA station antenna elevation\nSeparation of spacecraft between interrogations\nCommand sequencing\nSpacecraft engineering limitations\n\n0\n\nPredicted power available to the spacecraft for programming purposes\n\na Weekly predicted schedule o\nf\n\nCDA station contacts required for engineering\n\ncheckout\n1.2.2.11 Catalog a l reports and data coming into and leaving TEC into the permanent\nl\nTOS file.\n1.2.2.12 Prepare and transmit, in cooperation with TOC, a daily report on the progress\nof engineering checkout.\n1.2.2.13 TEC will make manual measurements of the analog V-head horizon sensor s t r i p\nchart recorder data for determination of instantaneous roll errors, and will produce the\nattitude for each orbit. TEC, with the assistance of the DSD Theory and Analysis Office,\nwill produce the daily definitive attitude for each day. The daily definitive attitude, plus\nan attitude prediction, w i l l be transmitted daily to Toc for input to the gridding program;\nthe data will also be used by TEC in programming f o r spacecraft command and control.\n1.2.2.14 Beacon data received from the CDA station will be recorded on analog strii,\nchart recorder charts and manual measurements will be made. The data will also be\nreccrded on a multichannel magnetic tape recorder. An analog-to-digital converter will\ndigitize the data and it will be formatted and recorded for computer processing and reduction. Ihe normal mode of spacecraft housekeeping telemetry processing will be a\nquick look of analog records at TEC and a daily computer printout of a l engineering units.\nl\nThe deflection levels beyond tolerance levels will be known and w i l l be checked as the\norbits occur. On a daily basis, the digitized telemetry data will be computer processed\nand a page print and card file of the actual data measurements will be made. Once each\n\nII-3\n\nweek the card file will be input to one Of the GSFC plotters for a historical record plot of\nthe telemetry parameters. These plots will become part of the permanent TOS files and\nwill be used for spacecraft assessment as required.\n1.3 TOC/TEC COORDINATION AND REPORTS\n\nThe close relationship and interaction of the TOC and TEC operations will require close\ncoordination of their activities and mutual reporting.\n1.3.1 CONFLICTS DURING LAUNCH AND CHECKOUT\n\nDuring the launch and checkout period, TEC will originate the command programs for a\nnew spacecraft. Simultaneously, TOC will have requirements to command existing TOS\nspacecraft. Scheduling conflicts in the use of CDA facilities and the communications\nnetwork can arise. The following procedures will be used to prevent o r resolve such\nconflicts.\nLaunch windows will be set to minimize conflicts. Replacement spacecraft will be\nlaunched into orbits nearly identical to those of the spacecraft replaced. However, injection time w i l l be planned so that the new spacecraft will be half an orbital period\nahead of or behind the old one.\nBefore launch, DSD Theory and Analysis will study potential acquisition conflicts and\ndevelop a plan to avoid conflicts in the postlaunch checkout of the whole TOS system.\nThe detailed plan will be issued before the launch of each new spacecraft. The predicted\nacquisition times for the replaced and the replacement TOS as well as the remaining\noperational TOS will be considered. bystem usage will be planned to allow both TEC\ncheckout and TOC operational responsibilities to be satisfied to the greatest extent\npossible.\nThe Director of the NESC Office of Operations and the TOS Project Manager will approve\nthis plan. Immediately after launch, the plan will be reviewed in light of the orbit\nachieved; changes will be made as required and approved by the manager and director.\nIf unanticipated conflicts develop during launch and checkout, the responsible persons at\nTEC and TOC will be required to work out solutions. (One possibility is that the\nnoninterference-basis mutual backup agreements may be exercised to relieve CDA\nantenna-loading conflicts.) If agreement cannot be reached, an appeal will be made to\nthe TOS Project Manager and to the NESC Office of Operations Director. In the event\nthat time does not permit resolution of a conflict through the appeal channel, a decision\nmust be made: during the two days immediately following launch, the new spacecraft will\nhave priority and the TEC decision will prevail; at all other times TOC will make the\nfinal decision. If an arbitrary decision is made in this way, a report of the circumstances\nmust be made to the appeal channel by those involved before leaving their duty posts for\nthe day.\n\n1.3.2 REPORTS AND OTHER COORDINATION ACTIVITIES\nAll reports and data generated in the normal operation of TOS will be collected by TOC\n\nand made available to TEC, including the processed telemetry data produced by DAPAF.\nThe objective will be to provide processed data for both daily operations a d the evaluation task. To help achieve this, GSFC TOS project personnel will participate with\nmembers of NESC in working out specifications for data processing programs as well as\nfor reports and other data.\n\n11-4\n\ne-\n\nCDA-TEC-TOC MISSION SIMULATION EXERCISE\n\n2\n.\n\nOn a daily basis beginning seven days before launch, sample data will be transmitted from\nthe CDA stations to TEC and TOC. The sample data will consist of video and beacon\nmagnetic training tapes that will resemble as closely as possible the passes of telemetry\nand video from an actual spacecraft in orbit. Video simulator outputs w i l l also be used\nfor video checks. The sample transmissions will be made on call by TEC via TOC at\nt i m e s that will not interfere with the missions of operational satellites. TEC will coor&natc all schedules m d programs with TOC, which will \'e monitoring all transmissions.\nb\nIn addition t o the daily tape transmissions, the CDA stations will compose and transmit\nappropriate teletype messages associated with the data. Just before the message text,\neach message w i l l read, "SAMPLE - - - - SAMPLE.\'\'\nExercise initiation will begin at T-0 when TEC will transmit a sample TOS program to\nthe CDA stations through TOC. Each CDA station will run the program tape through the\nCDA programmer and t o the long line equipment for relay to TOC/TEC. TEC and TOC\nwill process the received data and coordinate the timing and results. The simulation\nexercise results will be transmitted t o the CDA stations.\n\n21 WALOMS SCHEDULE\n.\n\n- WALOMS will transmit\n\ncalibration signals t o TEC\n\n0\n\nT plus 15 minutes\n\n0\n\nT plus 20 minutes WALOMS will transmit the beacon training tape, monitor\nhorizon sensor and DSAI recorded at the station, and report observations to TEC\nand TOC.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-\n\nT plus 40 minutes - WALOMS will send the video data tape and selected video simulator outputs at 7-1/2 ips to TEC and TOC.\nT plus 50 minutes - WALOMS will reduce the housekeeping telemetry and prepare\nthe sample telemetry and pass summary messages.\nT plus 60 minutes\nand TOC.\n\n- WALOMS will transmit pass\n\nsummary message, etc., to TEC\n\nGILMOR SCHEDULE\n\n22\n.\n0\n0\n\nT plus 55 minutes\n\n- GILMOR will transmit calibration signals t o TEC.\n\nT plus 60 minutes - GILMOR will transmit the beacon training tape, monitor\nhorizon sensor and DSAI data recorded at the CDA stations, and report observations\nto TEC and TOC.\n\n0\n\nT plus 80 minutes - GILMOR will send video data tape at 7-1/2 ips and selected\nvideo simulator outputs to TEC and TOC.\n\n0\n\nT plus 90 minutes - GILMOR will reduce the housekeeping telemetry and prepare\nthe sample telemetry and pass summary messages.\n\n0\n\nT plus 100 minutes\nand TOC.\n\n- GILMOR will transmit pass\n\nII- 5\n\nsummary messages, etc., to TEC\n\n3.\n\nFIVE-DAY ACTNATION P L A N\n\nA complete interrogation and telemetry tracking schedule, identical to that to be followed\non launch day and the succeeding four days, will be originated by TOC and disseminated\nt o all participating groups approximately two weeks before launch.

TEC\nTEC, operated by the TOS project, is responsible for spacecraft control during the launch\nand checkout phases until TOC acceptance of the operational spacecraft.\n\nBefore that time, TEC will analyze and evaluate all spacecraft data, review ground station and TOC reports, and forward a summary o findings and recommendations to the\nf\nProject Manager and TOC each day; when the spacecraft is Operational, a report on the\ncheckout phase will be filed. The reports will include comments on ground stations and\ncommunications performance.\nDuring spacecraft checkout, TEC personnel will evaluate spacecraft performance on a\nrealtime basis. Special attention will be given to attitude during the turnaround maneuver.\nThe performance of the communication and electrical systems used during the turnaround will be recorded and observed for engineering purposes, along with careful checks\nof the various units of the power system.\nPrelaunch Operations. For a two-week period preceding a TOS launch, TEC will prepare\nfor the launch and postlaunch operations. Simulated launch operations will be conducted,\nwith T&DS and TOC coordination. All shifts of the TOS ground system will participate:\nWALOMS, GILMOR, TEC, TOC, RCA-AED. TEC will transmit simulated command prog r a m s to the CDA stations via TOC and supplement the programs with direct voice contact\nduring the scheduled operation. Video and beacon data, either simulated or obtained from\nan operational TOS, will be received and processed at TEC. Engineering tests will be run\nto prove out the CDA stations. Normally, TEC 24-hour prelaunch operations will be conducted only during the last few days before launch.\n\n.\n\nLaunch and Initial Maneuver. TEC will operate as the spacecraft control center for the\nlaunch and checkout of the TOS. TEC will generate command programs and ground system schedules. TOC will include the TEC requirements in their weekly schedule. TEC\nwill transmit the program to the action and information addresses. TOC will transmit\ntheir weekly schedule to GFOM. NETCON w i l l transmit the NETCON schedules t o\nULASKA. At Fairbanks, the DAF shift supervisor integrates the two schedules. TEC\nwill have voice contacts with GILMOR, WALOMS, RCA-AED, and the launch net on lines\nmonitored by TOC. The CDA stations will transmit data from the APT and AVCS TOS\nvia TOSCOM to TEC and TOC for processing as required. Later system review may indicate the need for additional narrow bandwidth facilities; existing GSFC lines may be\nused. The initial maneuver commands will be generated at TEC to place the satellite in\nan operational position. Once the operational position has been achieved, the checkout\nand performance evaluation of the satellite w i l l proceed.\n\nnr- 1\n\nCheckout Plan and Performance Evaluation. The TOS project will prepare a checkout plan\nfor each spacecraft and submit it to ESSA for review and approval. During the checkout\nperiod, TOC w i l l monitor all operations of the new TOS. When the Director of the NESC\nOffice of Operations and the TOS Project Manager agree that the spacecraft is operational,\nTOC will assume responsibility. The plan will list in detail the operational tests that must\nbe successfully completed to check out a newly launched TOS.\nOperational Mode. After control of the spacecraft has been assumed by TOC, the GSFC\nTOS evaluation team will conduct long-term analyses of the spacecraft data. The evaluation team will normally use raw data recorded at TOC and operational analysis produced\nby DAPAF. Occasionally, TEC will be used to obtain special TOS data.\nWhen a s e r i o u s problem a r i s e s in the operation of the spacecraft, TOC may request TEC\nto assume responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the problems, and to\ndetermine if there are means of bypassing the difficulty.\n1.1 SYSTEMS OPERATIONS - LAUNCH AND CHECKOUT PLAN\nSystems operations for TEC will include:\n0\n\nRealtime systems assessment and evaluation\n\n0\n\nNear-real-time systems evaluation\n\n0\n\nAttitude determination and maneuvering\n\n0\n\nScheduling and programming\n\n0\n\nEngineering documentation and reporting\n\n0\n\nEquipment maintenance, operation, and calibration\n\nI\n\n1.1.1 REALTIME SYSTEMS ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION\n\n1.1.1.1 Prepass Functions\n0\n\nReview program of pass to be interrogated\n\n0\n\nReview spacecraft subsystem status, based on previous orbit program and telemetry\n\n0\n\nEstablish voice and data contact with CDA station interrogating spacecraft\n\n1.1.1.2\n\nFunctions During: a Pass\n\n0\n\nCheck quality of recorder data\n\n0\n\nV e r i f y spacecraft status from preinterrogation telemetry data; issue command\nprogram additions as required\n\n0\n\nVerify normal systems operations during readout; issue operational changes as\nrequired\n\n1.1.1.3\n0\n\nPostpass Functions\nEvaluate data quality of recordings\n\nReduce status housekeeping telemetry from s t r i p chart recorder data; maintain\ndaily history of selected data\nVerify all spacecraft subsystems status and update spacecraft status board\nEvaluate station events records and pass summaries\nComplete operations log, including a summary o all events relevant t o the interrof\ngated orbit\n\nPrepare data relative to next interrogation\n1.1.1.4 Engineering Data\nTEC will use engineering data from the APT and AVCS spacecraft and ground systems for\n\nassessment and realtime and near-real-time evaluation as ioiiows:\nAn 8-channel s t r i p chart recorder will record the return to zero (RZ) digital commands,\nthe satellite and ground e r r o r signals, and the time-shared telemetries from SCO 3 of\nthe spacecraft\'s beacon (which is displayed on channel 8 of the chart recorder), as shown\nin Table III-1. Channel 8 of the chart recorder contains important spacecraft data such\nas DSAI and the housekeeping telemetry, which is given a quick-look evaluation onpass as\nthe data is received in real time at TEC from the spacecraft; between passes the data will\nbe checked for out-of-tolerance levels. An analog-to-digital data conversion enables the\ndata to be processed by computer for printout of engineering values for the telemetry\npoints. Channel 8 also contains the command confirm verification which is received in\nreal time to enable TEC t o keep a close correlation check with status telemetry and events\ndata on spacecraft response to command. A 20-bit satellite picture time code and a frame\nof housekeeping telemetry appear with each AVCS frame on both record and playback of\neach AVCS picture.\nA two-channel s t r i p chart recorder will be used at 50 mm/sec to display the two channels\nof vee-head horizon sensor data which will be analyzed at TEC for determination of spacecraft attitude.

ORBIT AND ATTITUDE DETERMINATION\nThe GSFC Data Systems Division (DSD) will be responsible for systems readiness for\n\nlo\n\nearly orbit determination and for checkout of the automatic attitude determination system. DSD will determine the TOS orbit, prepare World Map and Satellite Acquisition\nData (WMSAD\'s) and STADAN and CDA station predictions, determine spacecraft attitude using the Automatic Attitude Determination Program System (AADPS), provide\nattitude predictions, and furnish associated orbit and attitude data as required by\nthe TOS project. When the new TOS is accepted by NESC, DSD support requirements\nare reduced t o TOS orbit determination, minute vector tape production, and provision\nof STADAN station predictions.\nThe Orbit and Attitude Computations Engineer, R. D. Werking of the Theory and Analysis\nf\nOffice, has the responsibility for coordination o the early orbit and automatic attitude\ndetermination plans. The Orbit and Attitude Computations Engineer will assist NESC by\nproviding orbital data to be used at TOC. He will also provide assistance to TEC in the\ndetermination of the best attitude for each orbit of the day and will prepare reports and\ndocuments as may be necessary, including a postflight analysis.\nThe Orbit and Attitude Computations Engineer will be responsible for conducting the orbit\ndetermination; including the differential correction, i.e., for the selection, evaluation, and\ninterpretation of the data; the selection of the orbit and attitude theories and the differential\ncorrection theory; the analysis and interpretation of the results, the use of the results for\npredictions, and releasing the results for other operational purposes; and the determination as t o when the operation has been completed.\n\n.\n\nThe Advanced Orbital Programming Branch is responsible for programming support as\nmay be needed because of special project demands. The Branch will arrange for representation from the programming staff during the orbit determination period to provide,\nin an emergency, detailed information on the capabilities of the entire orbit determination\nprogram library, as well as guidance in the u s e of such programs.\nThe Orbit Determination Section, Operational Computing Branch, is responsible for the\npreparation and prompt machine computation of world maps and station predictions and\nfor any special computations that may be required.

The data will be supplied to TEC after each orbit until the wheel orientation is\nachieved, at which time the data will be supplied on a daily basis o r upon special request.\nTwo modes of attitude determination are employed in AADPS. One mode uses a leastsquares-fit of roll observations, while the other mode uses a smoothed-roll observation/\nsun observation pair to compute spin vector orientation.\nA plan for attitude determination using sun and roll observations will be devised f o r the\ninitial maneuver, given nominal orbit and attitude maneuvers for each TOS spacecraft.\nThis data will be contained in "Prelaunch Analysis for TOS" report to be provided before\neach launch,\nRoll observations obtained from the V-head horizon scanner sensor and sun observations\nobtained from the digital solar aspect indicator are transmitted to TEC as an analog\nsignal.

They will be proce s s e d by means of a launch phase program. This program uses trajectory parameters\nof the second stage of the Delta vehicle and computes the orbit and attitude to be expected if the third-stage performance is nominal. This part of the launch phase operation will be the responsibility of the Theory and Analysis Office. The initial estimate\nof the orbit and attitude obtained from this launch phase program will normally be used\nin place of the nominal estimate t o begin the differential corrections. It will also be used\nto provide preliminary predictions to the tracking and telemetry stations and for other\npurposes if necessary.\nThe STADAN will take interferometer data as scheduled by NETCON on the basis of the\nnominal station predictions. Under normal conditions, the data from each tracking pass\nwill have been received from the Communications Division by the Minitrack Section within about 30 minutes after the tracking pass has been completed. The Minitrack Section\nwill be responsible for utilizing the CDC-16OA and peripheral equipment t o process the\ninterferometer data and to indicate which data points may be spurious o r questionable on\nthe basis of ambiguity resolution, consistency, etc. Data on IBM punched cards, together\nIII-18\n\n.\n\nI\n\n--\n\n(Please insert Figure III-6, TOS APT and AVCS\nSubsatellite Tracks from page III-20 of the original TOS Mission Operations Plan.)\n\nIn-1 9\n\nwith indications of the potential usefulness, will be handcarried t o the Orbit Determination Section representative. Under normal conditions the data will have been processed\nand evaluated by the Minitrack Section and made available for use in the IBM 7094 within about 15 minutes after they have been received f r o m the Communications Division.\nThe Orbit Determination Section representative will be responsible for processing the\ninterferometer data in the general orbit determination input program and for preparing\nthe data tape for use in the general orbit determination differential correction program.\nDuring the early orbit determination phase, the interferometer data will not be smoothed.\nUnder normal conditions, the data will have been processed by means of the general\norbit determination input program within about five minutes after being received at the\nIBM 7094.\nData from the normal T&DS support agencies will be received by the Minitrack Section\nwhere they will be transferred to punched c a r d s and made available for use in the IBM\n7094. These tracking data cards will be received and processed by means of the general\norbit determination program within about 50 minutes after receipt at GSFC.\nThe general orbit determination programs, including the input program, the differential\ncorrection program, the station prediction programs, and such other programs as may\nbe needed, will be operated by personnel of the Orbit Determination Section and the\nComputer Services Section under the direction of the Orbit and Attitude Computations\nEngineer. When a satisfactory orbit has been obtained on the basis of data from at least\nthree interferometer passes spanning an interval of at least one orbit, preliminary\norbital information will be provided to TEC, TOC, and NETCON/OPSCON. These results\nwill be confirmed by carrying out a differential correction with respect t o the interferome t e r data from four o r more interferometer tracking passes. When this has been done,\nand a satisfactory result has been achieved, the early orbit determination can be considered to have been completed. However, for the first 24 hours o r until otherwise advised, the interferometer data should be available for processing by the Minitrack Section no later than one hour after each pass has been completed. This requirement is\nplaced upon OPSCON to ensure that data is transmitted from the stations t o COMPUT\nt o be made available to the Orbit Determination Section when attempts are made to update the TOS orbit. The Orbit and Attitude Computations Engineer will notify OPSCON\nwhen this service i s no longer needed.\nImproved orbital elements and predictions based upon additional tracking observations\nwill then be released. The Orbit and Attitude Computations Engineer and the Orbit Determination Section representative will be responsible for providing world maps and\nprinted versions of the station predictions and a l e r t s to TEC, OPSCON, and NETCON.\nThey will also be responsible for furnishing prediction magnetic tapes to the Minitrack\nSection and a position vector tape t o TOC. The Minitrack Section will be responsible\nfor transmitting the teletype versions of the station predictions to the Communications\nDivision.\n2.2.2 ATTITUDE\n\nTOS will be placed in orbit with a spin axis orientation similar to the conventional\nTIROS satellites. The spacecraft spin axis will be in o r very near the orbital plane and\nin the general direction of the velocity vector at injection. The operational orientation\nis to keep the spin axis perpendicular t o the orbital plane which requires the initial\nwheel maneuver. The orientation maneuver should begin on the first orbit and continue\nfor about 18 orbits. It is important, therefore, to determine the orbit as soon as possible.\nTo assist in making the determination, two sources of data will be used. All available\ninjection data will be studied and attitude data in the form of horizon scanner and sun\n\nIII- 2 0\n\naspect data obtained from the satellite will be processed. Tne injeciiuii & z iviZ zct iis a\nt\nstarting point f o r the rest of the work which will follow.\nThe attitude data will be received at TEC via the telephone lines from the ground station.\nAfter this data is received, digitized, and recorded in TEC, it is processed by AADPS\non an IBM 7094. The results are then given to TEC with suggested attitude correction\ncommands. Also supplied to TEC is the status data which was processed through AADPS.\nAll cif L%s support will be supplied on a pass-by-pass basis until the initial maneuver\nh a s been completed or until the Orbit and Attitude Computations Engineer determines\nthat the need f o r pass-by-pass coverage no longer exists.\nDuring the launch and checkout phase of a TOS mission, orbit and attitude data will be\nsupplied by DSD t o various groups. Following is a list of data to be supplied t o OPSCON,\nTEC, and TOC. OPSCON will receive the world map and sTAuAiU predictions, equator\ncrossings, and orbital elements. This information will be supplied every seven days,\nusing the latest orbital information available.\nFor the f i r s t month after launch, TEC will be provided with printouts predicting orbital\nand picture data and attitude data at the intervals listed:\n\n- available two weeks before f i r s t\n\n0\n\nA 28-day WMSAD listing GILMOR and WALOMS\ndate of data\n\n0\n\n14-day ATMAPW\n\n0\n\nA 28-day COSSAK\n\n0\n\n1-day definitive and 3-day predictive Magnetic Attitude Prediction Wheel-Attitude\nSmoothing Program (MGAPW-ASP) available each day\n\n0\n\n- available four\n\ndays before the first date of the data\n\n- available two weeks before first date of data\n\n-\n\nStatus Data Extraction, Evaluation, Reduction (STADEE) - available each day\n\nBoth MGAPW and STADEE will be supplied on an orbit-by-orbit basis until the reorientation maneuver has been completed.\nThe data to be supplied by-DSD during the checkout phase is centered around the generation of the position vector tape. The first of these tapes will be made available at the end\nof the early orbit determination phase. Also t o be made available will be the computation of CDA station prediction data. In general this will consist of ENV data which are\nused to produce drive tapes for the 85-foot dish antennas.\nThe second position vector tape will be provided approximately three days after launch.\nTracking data will be generated and made available t o TOC and to ULASKA. This will\nthen become an operational procedure.\nAttitude and status data will be provided at regular intervals depending upon the needs\nof TEC.\n3.\n\nGSFC OPERATIONS CONTROL\n\n3.1 OPSCON\nThe T&DS Operations Director in the GSFC Operations Control Center (OPSCON) is\nresponsible f o r control of the GSFC ground support facilities used during launch.

The countdown is divided into tasks, such as spacecraft preparation,\nengine checks, electrical system checks, loading of fuel, and loading of liquid oxygen.\nEach task is assigned to a special crew under the direction of a task leader; several tasks\ncan be accomplished simultaneously. Each task leader must request permission from the\nTest Conductor before h e starts his task, must execute the task in accordance with the\nCountdown Manual, and must report to the Test Conductor when his task is completed.\nThe task leader must consult the Test Conductor on any problems, and determine a course\nof action jointly within him.\nTasks involving spacecraft preparation are directed by the Spacecraft Systems Manager,\nwho reports to the Test Conductor. The Spacecraft Systems Manager submits the final\nspacecraft task events to the Test Conductor prior to R-10 day for integration into the\nCountdown Manual. Typical R-1 day and R-0 day countdown milestones a r e listed in\nTables IV-2 and IV-3.\n\n7.\n\nVEHICLE HANDLING\n\nThe Improved Delta vehicle will be stored and checked out at the DAC Santa Monica mission checkout a r e a as shown in Figure IV-11. Each stage will be stored until it is committed to a flight. The first and second stages will then be brought to the grid area and\nplaced in a mission-peculiar configuration. Component, subsystem, system, and all systems tests will be conducted on the vehicle to assure i t s flight readiness. Each subsystem\nwill be assembled, tested and certified for flight. Only if anomalies or failures are encountered will a subsystem be disassembled while on the launch pad. For example, flight\nBTL 600 missile-borne guidance equipment (MBGE) will be installed and checked out at\nSantaMonica. Figure IV-12 is a typical schedule for vehicle preparation at the launch site.\nThird- stage/spacecraft assembly and alignment will initially be done at Building 34.\n8.\n\nSPACECRAFT HANDLING\n\n8.1 SHIPMENT OF SPACECRAFT AND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT\nThe TOS-AVCS spacecraft will be transported from RCA/AED to WTR in an airtight\nshipping container pressurized with dry-nitrogen at a positive pressure of approximately\n2 psig. The shipping container, including the spacecraft, weighs approximately 900\npounds, and is 58 inches in diameter and 53 inches high. Both the transmitting antenna\nand the receiving antenna will be removed from the spacecraft and shipped in a separate\npackage. Four spinup rockets will be installed on the spacecraft, but the rocket terminals\nwill be shorted by means of jumper leads before shipment. These leads will remain in\nplace until just before installation of the third-stage fairing.\n8.2 SPACECRAFT HANDLING AT BUILDING 34\nIf the spacecraft is airlifted to Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) ULO will provide a\ntractor to haul the spacecraft in i t s container to the NASA/ULO spacecraft laboratory in\nBuilding 34. The spacecraft assembly areas in Building 34 will be used for the operational\nchecks and tests of the spacecraft. Overhead cranes, forklift trucks, and other powerhandling equipment will be provided by NASA. In general, this equipment will be manned\nby NASA operators. At all times that the spacecraft is moved a t WTR it will be escorted\nby AFSSD guards.\nIV- 14\n\n.-\n\nTzble IV-2\nTypical R-1 Day Milestones\n\nTime\nBefore\nLiftoff\n\nT-495\n\nEvent*\nCountdown initiation\n\n(0800)\n\n--\n\nT-490\n(0805)\n\nHigh pressure nitrogen m d helium storage bottle: on line\nEngine checks begin\n\nT-360\n(1115)\n\nEngine checks complete\nRange countdown initiation\nElectrical systems checks begin\nSpacerraft checks begin\n\nT-350\n(1025)\n\nAll systems on external power\nC -band beacon\nTelemetry\nCommand destruct receiver\nWECO guidance\nRange readouts required\nC-band beacon\nTelemetry\nRange command destruct checks\nSystems off as readouts complete\n\nT-320\n\nAll s y s t e m s off\n\n(1055)\n\nCool-off period begins\n\nT-290\n\n(1125)\n\nAll systems on external power for range go report\nAll systems on internal power for range go report\n\nT-270\n(1225)\n\nSpacecraft checks complete\n\nT-265\n(1140)\n\nAll systems on external power\n\nT-260\n(1155)\n\nAll s y s t e m s o f\nf\n\nT-250\n(1205)\n\nElectrical systems data review\n\nT-240\n(1215)\n\nElectrical systems checks complete\nRange countdown complete\nSecond-stage propellants on station\nComDlex fire water pressure to 125 psig\nFire-and medical support required (fire support\non station suited up)\nSecond stage propellant servicing begins\n\nT-30\n(1545)\n\nSecond stage propellant servicing complete\n(Complex fire water will be maintained at 125 psig until\nsecond stage propellants are unloaded or launch test is\nterminated.)\nSecond stage retrorocket pressurization begins\n\nT-0\n(1615)\n\nSecond stage retrorocket pressurization complete\nR-day countdown complete\nLaunch camera set UP\n\n*Functions and s e r v i c e s that r e q u i r e range support a r e underlined.\n\nIV-15\n\nTable IV-3\nTypical R -

The area will be closed\noff by all practical means, and only personnel associated with the TOS project will be\npermitted access.\nThe launch support van will arrive two weeks before the spacecraft and will be parked\nalongside Building 34. After launch, the van will bz stored and checkedmt periodicallyby\nRC4.\n\n-.\n\n8.3 SEPET AND INTERFERENCE TESTS\nA standard electrical performance test (SEPET) will be conducted. Concurrent with mrformance of the SEPET, and depending upon availability of support personnel and schedule\nb.s+??ed with a &imixy Lkiid-Siw:e veilicie ai the\nof events, t h e prototype m d d will ?x\nSpin Test Facility. The third-stage/prototype combination will be taken to t h e launch pad,\nusing the ground handling fixture. Douglas Aircraft Company (DAC) personnel will be\nresponsible (with RCA assistance) for mating the spacecraft to the third stage.\n\nDAC will perform all subsequent handling and installation of the dummy third-stage/\nprototype combination to t h e second stage of the launch vehicle. When the installation is\nCompleted, RCA will conduct an open-loop transmission test and will support the WTRdirected RF interference tests. When the RF interference tests are completed, the dummy\nthird-stage/prototype combination will be returned to the Spin Test Facility for disassembly. No other tests shwald be performed with the prototype model. It will be crated\nin its shipping container and returned to Building 34. After the launch, RCA will ship it\nto the RCA/AED facility.\n\na\n\n8.4 SPIN TEST FACILITY\nThe spacecraft will be physically turned over to NASA in its shipping container, and\ntransported by NASA truck to the Spin Test Facility.\n\nUpon removal from the shipping container, the spacecraft will be weighed to confirm\nweight measurements made at RCA/AED before shipment. After the weighing procedures,\nDAC will mate the spacecraft to the live third-stage vehicle, using standard handling\nprocedures. A weighting ring (approximately 85 pounds) attached to the three hat lugs\nwill provide sufficient force to compress the separation ejection spring. Only personnel\nimmediately concerned u7ith the operations will be permitted in the area; all others will\nremain in a safe protective area. From the time the spacecraft is mated to the third-stage\nuntil launch, the spacecraft will be grounded by means of a grounding lug on the underside\nof the baseplate.\n8.5 SERVICE TOWER\nThe third-stage/spacecraft combination will be mated to the second-stage launch vehicle\nin accordance with standard DAC procedures. The launch pad crane will lift the spacecraft handling fixture o f its flat-bed truck and hoist it to the eight level. Another crane\nf\nwill lift the third-stage/spacecraft combination from the eight to the ninth level, and the\ncombination will be mated to the second stage of the launch vehicle. The spacecraft optics\nwill then be uncovered, a visual examination will be made, and the charging plug fed from\nblockhouse will be installed. The spacecraft will be checked out in accordance with Task IV\ncheckout procedures and cameras will be checked. A special test will determine proper\noptical focus of the TV cameras. In the optical-focus portion of this test, each T V camera\nwill view a 2-foot square light box mounted on a tripod located at least 5 feet from the\nedge of the spacecraft. A switch at least 10 feet away will control power to the light box.\n\nThe third-stage fairing will be installed after the spacecraft has successfully passed the\nTask IV checkout and after the spinup rocket mufflers and shorting leads a r e removed.\n\nIv-19\n\n8.6 SUMMARY O F WTR OPERATIONS SCHEDULE\nThe following paragraphs describe the major spacecraft events that will occur during the\ncheckout and launch preparations at WTR. R days refer to 8-hour working days before\nlaunch; R - 0 refers to the day on which the actual launch occurs. The outlined schedules\nshould be considered as guide lines only, to be adjusted as required and directed by the\nMission and Spacecraft Directors.\nR-25\n\nThe spare ordnance items will be shipped to WTR for storage until required o r\nuntil the launch effort is completed.\n\nR-22\n\nThe launch support van will a r r i v e at WTR. It will enter the SAFB gate and\nproceed to Building 34 where it will be parked. After the launch, the launch\nsupport van will be stored by NASA until R-22 of the next launch. RCA will provide periodic checkouts.\n\nR- 14\n\nThe prototype spacecraft and the flight spacecraft will be transported from\nRCA/AED to WTR in sealed shipping containers which have been purged and\npressurized to approximately 2 psig with dry air o r nitrogen before sealing.\nThe flight spacecraft will be shipped with the spinup rockets mounted and\nwired, and with the shorting leads in place. The rocket mufflers will not be\ninstalled. The prototype model will not have ordnance items. No battery\npower can be applied to the rockets because of the open circuits caused by the\ndisabled liftoff switches and the absence of the spacecraft power plug. The required test equipment, spacecraft spares, handling gear, and miscellaneous\nsupplies will be shipped with the spacecraft.\n\nR-13\n\nWhen the spacecraft and associated equipment arrive at WTR, they will be\nunloaded by RCA with assistance from WTR personnel as required. If they\na r e shipped to VAFG, ULO will provide transportation as required to haul\nthem t o the Spacecraft Lab in Building 34.\n\nR- 12\n\nThe units will be unpacked and stored as required. The flight spacecraft will\nbe removed from the shipping container and the rocket mufflers will be installed. NASA and RCA representatives will make a quick-look inspection for\nobvious damage. The flight s p a r e s will be unpacked, given quick-look inspections, and stored. The prototype model will be prepared for electrical checks.\nThe launch-support van will be given a standard calibration test.\n\nR- 11\n\nMechanical inspection of the flight spacecraft will be performed. The flight\nspacecraft SEPET will begin.\n\nR- 10\n\nThe prototype model will be given a functional electrical check, following the\npretest calibration of the launch-support van, and a final mechanical inspection. Following completion of this test and inspection, the prototype model will\nbe delivered in a shipping container to the NASA Spin Test Facility to be mated\nwith the dummy third stage. After mating with the third stage, the assembly\nwill be delivered in a special shipping container to SLC-BE for mating with the\nbooster. The spacecraft functional test will continue on the flight spacecraft.\n\nR- 9\n\nThe R F compatibility tests with the vehicle will be performed using the prototype spacecraft.\n\nR- 8\n\nThe flight spacecraft electrical performance test will be completed. The dummy\nthird stage prototype model combination will be removed from the booster and\nreturned, in its special shipping container, to the Spin Test Facility. Removal\nof the prototype model from the dummy third stage will be completed, and the\nprototype model will be returned, in its shipping container, to Building 34 f o r\nstorage. A final mechanical inspection will be made on the flight spacecraft.\nIV-20\n\na-\n\nR- 7\n\nA spacecraft electrical check, with closed-loop RF conditions, will be run to\ncheck the proper operation of a l subsystems before movement of the spacel\ncraft. The spacecraft will then be placed in its shipping container and transferred by NASA vehicle to the NASA Spin Test Facility. The spacecraft will\nbe given to DAC for mating with the third stage. Weigh-in and alignment will\nbe completed. The spinup rocket mufflers, shorting leads, and protective\ncovers will remain in place at all times except as required for tare weight\ndetermination. During the weighing and alignment activities, a minimum number of RCA/AED support personnel will be in the area.\n\nR-6\n\nThe alignment activity will be completed. The third-stage/spacecraft assembly\nwill be prepared for transportation to SLC-2E. After the installation of the\nassembly on the booster, a spacecraft functional check will be performed to\ndetermine the operation status of the spacecraft. During the spacecraft functional check, all ordnance protective devices will be in place. Following the\nspacecraft functional check, the air-conditioning shrouds w i l l be put in place,\nand battery charging will take place for a period of approximately 4 hours.\n\nR-5\n\nThe standard All-Systems Checks will be performed. At the completion of\nthese checks, spacecraft functional checks will be performed. Spacecraft batteries will be charged for a period of 4 hours at the completion of the spacecraft functional checks.\n\nR- 4\n\nSpacecraft functional tests to be run nonconcurrent with ordnance installation.\n\nR-3\n\nSpacecraft functional tests to be run nonconcurrent with ordnance installation.\n\nR- 2\n\nSpacecraft functional checks will be performed to check the spacecraft status.\nSpacecraft batteries will be charged for a period of 4 hours following completion of the test. During the battery-charging times, the solar array will be\ncleaned using liquid freon, paper towels, cotton swabs, and a venturi-effect airpowered vacuum cleaner.\n\nR-1\n\nR-1 day tasks will be performed. Final mechanical inspection of the spacecraft\n\n-\n\nand vacuuming of the solar array will be completed during the &hour batterycharging cycle. The spacecraft will be prepared for fairing installation. All\nordnance protection will be removed at this time. Following fairing installation, a short Task IV will be performed.\nR-0\n\nR-0 Day tasks will be performed. Charging of the spacecraft batteries will be\ncontinuous throughout the R-0 activities until launch.\n\n9\n.\n\nLAUNCH CONSTRAINTS\n\n9 1 COUNTDOWN HOLD CRITERIA\n.\nThe TOS Project determines whether the countdown will be held, based on the criteria\nlisted below.\n9 2 SPACECRAFT HOLD\n.\n\nT miniis 1 day\n\n: Any malfunction is cause for spacecraft hold.\n\nT minus 7 hours : A complete go/no-go program is run. Any malfunction causes a hold.\nT minus 3 hours : A go/no-go check is performed after the rocket fueling operation. The\nTV subsystem is reprogrammed for operation. Any malfunction in the\nspacecraft causes a hold.\n\nIv-21\n\nT minus 1 hour\n\n: A hold is called as needed to bring the spacecraft batteries to at\nleast 90 percent of full charge before the umbilical is dropped.\n\n9.3 VEHICLE HOLD\nAll vehicle in-line subsystems must be operational as specified in the Countdown Manual.\nIf more than one telemetry channel becomes inoperative during the countdown, a hold may\nbe called to review the implications to postflight malfunction analysis.\n9.4 DATA STATIONS\nA hold is called for nonreadiness of the data communications net or for nonreadiness of\nany CDA station but not for nonreadiness of RCA/AED o r TOC.\n10. LAUNCH EVENTS\nThe nominal sequence of events from T-0 through separation of the spacecraft from the\nthird-stage motor is listed in Table IV-4. Note that these events are typical for a TOS\nlaunch and do not apply to a specific launch.\nDuring launch and early orbit, data from the range and launch support facilities is transmitted to DSD computing center where the launch trajectory is computed. The data collecting functions of this net a r e completed when the vehicle passes beyond the range of\nWTR on the launch trajectory. Trajectory and orbit injection parameters a r e transmitted\nto DSD computing center for use in the succeeding orbit-refinement computations.\nFrequency versus time data is relayed by data phone to OPSCON on a realtime basis.\nThe Mission Director in MDC o r his representative will have relayed to TEC, by telephone o r teletype, all other pertinent launch data and information. OPSCON/NETCON\nand TEC receive the results of initial orbit calculations and trajectory data. From these\ndata, the orbit is refined and ephemeris predictions will be given to TEC.\n\n11. TRACKING\nDuring the launch and early orbit phase, the spacecraft is tracked by the NASA Telemetry\nStation, a down range ship, and by STADAN, NORAD, and SAO.\n11.1 DOWN RANGE SHIP\nA Down Range Ship will provide second/third stage spinup and separation. Doppler equipment aboard ship will b e used to confirm time of third stage ignition and burnout.\n11.2 NASA TELEMETRY STATION\nThe NASA Telemetry station tracks the spacecraft signal from lift-o\xe2\x82\xacf until loss of signal.\nDoppler information is relayed to OPSCON via data phone and t h e same information is\ndisplayed i n t h e MDC, Building 32. Realtime records also provide vehicle functions such\nas ignition, burnout, and stage separations.\n11.3 STADAN\nAll STADAN interferometer tracking stations are required to track as scheduled by\nOPSCON/NETCON during this phase and forward the tracking information to GPUT.\nDuring this phase, control of STADAN is exercised by the GSFC Operations Director in\nOPSCON. Additional personnel a r e appointed as required by the Operations Director and\nas dictated b project requirements. This phase s t a r t s at T-240 minutes and continues\ny\nu n t i l terminated by the Operations Director. The Operations Controller notifies the stations at the end of the phase.\nIV-22\n\n--\n\n0 *\n\nTable N - 4\nTypical Launch Events\nTime\n(sec. after\nliftoff)\n\nInitiated by\n\n-50switch\n\nT+O\n\n-.\n\nStart stage I programmer\n\nT+2\n\nLO switch\n\nStart roll program (plus 6.00944\n\nStage I programmer\n\n.deg/sec;

Before\ndespin the spacecraft spins at approximately 126 rpm; after despin it spins at about 10\nrpm. Separation occurs about 1274 seconds after liftoff; despin occurs approximately\n9 i. 5 minutes after separation. The stations responsible for receiving V-scan data during\nthis phase are WALCOMS, GILMOR, JOBURG, MADGAR, and WNKFLD. Figure 1V-13\nshows the telemetry system equipment setup f o r TOS.

The PM-detected output of the\ntelemetry receiver tuned to 136.700 Mc is fed to the tunable discriminators tuned to a\ncenter frequency of 2300 and 3000 cps w i t h a *7.5% deviation\nThe output of the discriminator is displayed in red time on a Sanborn recorder, which is\n~\nI atI a chart speed of 25 mm/sec.\nThe spin rate is determined by observing the frequency of the V-head horizon sensor (Figure N-14) and subtracting the time of pulse two\nfrom the time of pulse one to get the time for one complete revolution and then dividing\n60 by the time of one revolution. These stat i m ~ iiiciriitor for separation and despin.\nabsc\nSeparation is indicated by the 2300 cps SCO\nchanging from 2473 cps where it is biased at\nlaunch back to 2300 cps.\nThe tracking ship also records and displays\nsecond-stage vehicle telemetry in real time.\nA 234.00-Mc transmitter is F M modulated\nwith the required telemetry aboard the Delta\nsecond stage. The tape is shipped as soon as\npossible after the telemetry has been recorded\'\nto the following address:\n\n-\n\nGoddard Space Flight Center (NASA)\nAttention: Code 470, Mr. W. A. Beck\nDelta Project Office\nGreenbelt, Maryland, U.S.A\n\nFigure IV-14\nSample Horizon\nSensor Signal\n\nThe equipment setup for recording is as follows: The detected output of the receiver\ntuned to 234 Mc is fed to the bandswitching subcarrier discriminator tuned to IEUG\nchannel 9 with a rt 7-1/2% deviation and displayed in real time on a Sanborn recorder.\nThe tape recorder track assignments a r e listed in Table IV-6.\nThe telemetry is PDM/FM/FM, with 45 channels being transmitted at 20 frames per second, to give an approximately 900 cps bit rate. Channel 1 is the zero-volt calibration\nchannel and channel 24 a 5-volt calibration channel. Channels 44 and 45 are suppressed\nto provide the synchronization channels. The carrier drift is less than 10 kc with a maximum bandwidth of c 150 kc.\nThe receiver bandwidth is 500 kc. The recording time is from acquisition until loss of\nsignal. Trajectory predictions are furnished 7 days before launch\nThe tracking ship requirements are:\ne Magnetic tape recording (at 30 ips); requires 90 kc response:\n\n234.0-MC signal\n136.770-Mc spacecraft signal\n136.770-MC AGC\nTiming - NASA 36 bit\nRaw doppler data\n(Note: 234.0-Mc signal to be recorded on a direct record amplifier).\n\nIV-31\n\nTrack\n\nRecord Module\n\nSource\n\nSignal\n\nDirect\n\nHallamore Multiplex\n\n234 Mc receiver AGC\'s\n\nDirect\n\nControl track gen.\nand time STD\nsystem\n\n18.24 kc modulated with\n60 cps and combined\nwith BCD time\n\nDirect\n\n234 Mc receiver\n\nComposite signal\n\nFM\n\nTime STD system\n\nSerial decimal time code\n\nDirect\n\nAudio amplifier\n\nWWV audio o r voice\ncommentary\n\n(No requirements\nfor recording on\nthis track)\n\nSpacecraft Telemetry\nDirect\n\nHallamore Multiplex\n\n136.770 receiver AGC\'s\n\nDirect\n\nDoppler station\n\nf Signal\n\nDirect\n\n136.770 Mc receiver\n\nComposite signal\n\nDirect\n\nDoppler station\n\n10.0 kc\n\nDirect\n\n136.770 Mc receiver\n\nComposite signal\n\nFM\n\nTime STD system\n\nSerial decimal time code\n\nDirect\n\nAudio Amplifier\n\nWWV audio or voice\ncommentary\n\n0\n\nStrip chart AGC recording, 136.770 and 234.0-Mc on same chart\n\n0\n\nStrip chart, discriminated 3.9 kc SCO on 234.0-Mc link\n\n0\n\nRealtime reports as follows: (from 2300 cps and 3.0 kc SCO)\n"Spinup received"\n"Separation received" (from 2300 cps only)\n"Spinup RPM is\ncycles per second" (this is obtained from either 2.3\nkc o r 3.0 kc SCO)\n\n0\n\nStrip chart, discriminated 2.3 kc and 3.0 kc from 136.770 Mc\n\n0\n\nSCDT time STD\n\nIV- 32\n\na-\n\nThe vehicle tapes are to be shipped to:\nUnmanned Launch Operations\nP.O. Box 186,\nCape Canaveral, Florida\nU.S.A.\nAttention: A. J. Mackey\n\n-\n\nCopies are provided TEC as soon as possible. The realtime reports are made to hangar\nAE, Cape Kennedy (GCPN) and OPSCON (GOPS) via existing cpmmunications means.\nThe following is a description of the data to be read, and how to read it.\nIn order to assist in the determination o success or failure of a mission, and to assist\nf\nin prediction of preliminary orbital parameters, the verification and time of Occurrence\nof third-stage spinup and separation a r e desired. This data is displayed on the IRIG\nchannel 9 (3.9 kc) on the second-stage telemetry system (234.0 Mc). The data is recorder on magnetic tape and on a direct-write recorder for immediate readout by ship\npersonnel.\nFour items of information a r e desired: occurrence of the events; time of spinup indication; time of separation indication; and spinup RPM.\nThese times of spinup and separation are reported as accurately as possible, but at least\nto within f 1 second (preferably 0.1 second) in Zulu time. Any realtime recordings run\nfor this purpose are not stopped, but continue to run to preclude any possiblilty o stopping\nf\non an erroneous indication and missing the real events. Expected wave shapes are shown\nin Figure lV-15.\nAt spinup, which occurs at Time A, the voltage level increases from 40% to 95%, and\nbegins cycling at approximately 6 cps. The elapsed time from A to B is 2 seconds.\nActual separation occurs at time B, at which time the rate of cycling abruptly decreases\nand continues to slow down. At time C the cycling stops, and the channel may come to\nrest at either a 40% or 95% level. This level is not measured. Prior to the spinup time\nthis channel has other steps, all of which are complete by SECO + 1 second. These other\nevents are not reported.\nThere should be a small loss of signal, 0 3 seconds duration, at spinup + 6 seconds. This\n.\nis stage-three ignition, and may be reported i f observed, but only as a drop in AGC-not\nas a confirmed ignition event.\nSpinup RPM is measured during the time interval from D to B. In this example it is\n2.5 cycles per second. It may vary from 2 cycles per second to 6 cycles per second.\nExactly 1 second of time is not required, but only this portion of the wavetrain is used.\nf\nSpin rate can be determined by counting the number o cycles to the nearest tenth, from\nD to B (1 second interval) to obtain cycles per second. Then spin rate (RPM) equals CPS\ndivided by 2, multiplied by 60.\n12.2 JOBURG, MADGAR, AND WINKFIELD\nJOBURG. MADGAR. and WINKFIELD are responsible for determining if separation and\ndespin did occur. Procedures for determining separation are as follows:\nThe normal 2300-cps subcarrier, which phase modulates the 136.770-Mc beacon with\nV-head horizon sensor information, is biased to 2473 cps from launch until separation of\nthe spacecraft from the third stage. At separation, the bias is removed and the subcarrier\nfrequency returns to 2300 cps.\nIV- 33\n\nSPINUP\n\n95%-\n\nSEPARATION\n\n1\'\nI\n\n4%\n0-\n\nI\nI\n\n--\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nA\n\nI\n\nD\n\n0% !LOW FREQUENCY\nI BAND EDGE\n\nI\n\n0\n\nI\nI c l S E C - cI\nl\n\nI\n\nSEC-\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nRead Spin Rate Between Times D and B\nFigure IV-15\n\n- Spinup Wavetrain for TOS 3.9-Kc\n\nC\n\nVCO on 234.0-Mc Carrier\n\nThe equipment setup is shown in Fig. W-27. Separation is determined by observing the\ncenter frequency o the 2300 cps subcarrier on the 136.770-Mc beacon. If the center fref\nquency is closer to the 2473-cps side of the record, separation did not occur. If it is\ncloser to the middle of the record, then the separation did occur. This information is forwarded to OPSCON/TEC via SCAMA via TTY.\nProcedures for determining spin rate are covered in 12.1, paragraph 2.\n12.3 DSAI STADAN SUPPORT\nThe following STADAN stations record 136.770-Mc telemetry digital solar aspect indicator (DSAI) data for the first 20 orbits as scheduled by TEC through NETCON: SNTAGO,\nWNKFLD, ORORAL, and JOBURG. SNTAGO is not required for quick look on pass one\nbut report on playback a s soon as possible.\nThe procedure for recording and reporting DSAI is as follows:\nTo supplement attitude determination data DSAI must be obtained from the 136.77 Mc\nFM/PM beacon. The Electrac phase demodulator is used to demodulate the carrier.\nThis beacon uses three subcarriers, 2.3, 3.0, and 3.9 kc. The s t r i p chart is operated at\n25 mm/sec. The data to be monitored is on the 3.9 kc subcarrier.\nThe DSAI provides the data indicating the angle between the spin axis and the sun. The\nDSAI uses a form of gray code binary. The code consists of 8 bits, each having a return\nto center frequency square wave characteristic. A deflection in the direction of a lower\nbit,\nfrequency represents a 11111 while a deflection in the opposite direction (higher\nfrequency) represents a "0" bit. As a further check, the eighth bit should be a "1."\n\nIV-34\n\nBefore dcspin the DSAI code is unusable. After despin the DSAI rode i s repeated every\n5 to 6 seconds.\nThe data i s reported to GOPS GOSI as ;I series of "ones" (1\'s) and "zeroes\'\' (0\'s) along\nwith the time at which thc reading w a s made. For exmiple: 1129202, 11100111. Six\nconsecutive readings are to be reported. It is possible Cor various types of data to be\ntransmitted on the 3.9 kc SCO, so it is important to look only for data in t h e fnrm of &bit\nrctiirn \'cii center Prequelicy format. If no data of this type is received, GOPS and GOSI\nshould be notified after the pass is completed.\nAll DSAI quick-look data is teletyped to GOPS and GOSI immediately after the pass is\ncompleted.\n13.\n\nCDA STATION ACTIVITIES\n\nThe CDA stations are r e s p n s i b l e for acquisition, commanding and disseminating the\nTOS spacecraft data. The stations are Wallops Station, Virginia (WALOMS) and at\nFairbanks, Alaska (GILMOR). During the launch and checkout phase, commands <encrated by TEC and relayed through TOC are received a t the stations and used for spacecr\'aft command as described i n Appendix D. Activities during the opcrational phase are\ncovered under NESC SOP\'S.\n13.1 HANDLING O F SPACECRAFT DATA\nAll data transmitted from the satellite during the pass over the CDA station is recorded\n011 a tape recorder. This will be the station tape. When AVCS video data are received\na second tape recorder also records the video data.\nTelemetry data from the 136.770-Mc beacon is recorded on Brush record charts and both\nmagnetic tape recorders. Extracts of these recordings are teletyped to TOC/TEC if directed by TOC. Telemetry is transmitted to TOC/TEC i n real time and also with video\nsignals over the broadband line in slightly delayed time. Daily and prepass telemetry\ncalibrations are performed, using the procedures established in the Prelaunch Operational Analysis Handbook. The paper tapes and magnetic tapes are mailed to TOC as\ndirected by TOC.\nThe AVCS video data i s played over the broadband link to DAPAF as directed by TOC.\nAll recorded data is properly marked and held for degaussing, destruction, o r mailing\nas instructed by TOC.\nDuring the checkout phase, Polaroid pictures are made as specified by TOC. Rem\'arks\nwill be made on the pass summary describing the quality of t h e s e polaroids, which may\nbe destroyed aiter completion of the report.\n13.2 STATION EVENTS\nEach CDA station has a 20-channel events recorder that monitors station performance\nand some of the spacecraft responses to CDA command. T h e events recorder is used for\npostpass reconstruction of the type and timing o commands sent and data received. The\nf\nevents recorder data includes:\n0\n\nGMT time markers\n\n0\n\nCommand modes used during the pass\n\n0\n\nTV and other signal occurrence and loss\nxv-35\n\n13.3 ATTITUDE DETERMINATION\nDuring spacecraft checkout, TEC d e t e r m i n e s attitude. TOC p e r f o r m s this function during\nthe operational life of a satellite.\n13.4 GRIDDING\nNo picture gridding is performed a t CDA stations.\n13.5 OPERATION& REPORTING\nEach station reports to TOC/TEC a summary of all events which o c c u r r e d during and\nrelative to the interrogation and readout. This is teletyped to TOC/TEC in a p a s s summary message within 30 minutes after the interrogation. If t h e r e are details which\ndelay the message longer than this, they are provided in a n addendum which r e a c h e s\nTOC/TEC before the end of the orbital day. C u r r e n t information is passed immediately\nto TOC/TEC by voice.

It is an 18-sided right polyhedron, 22.5\ninches high and 42 inches in diameter, consisting of a reinforced baseplate carrying most\nsubsystems and a cover assembly (hat) with solar cells mounted on the outer top and\nsides; dynamics control coils and nutation dampers are mounted inside the hat (Figure A-1).\nOperings in the hat are provided f o r the various sensors mounted on the baseplate. A\ncrossed-dipole antenna projects f r o m the bottom of the baseplate and a monopole antenna\nprojects vertically from the top center of the hat.\nThe entire assembly is strengthened to accommodate the severe launch vibration environment and to provide margin for future growth.\n\n2.\n\nAPT SUBSYSTEM\n\nThe APT configuration is the basic spacecraft carrying two redundant APT camera subsystems. Figure A-2 shows the baseplate layout; Figure A-3 is a spacecraft block diagram. The APT subsystem is a camera and transmitter combination (Figure A-4) designed to transmit slow-scan television pictures of the cloudcover below the spacecraft.\nTransmission is automatic and in real time.\n\nThe APT subsystem consists of three major elements: the camera assembly, containing\nlens, shutter, vidicon, deflection coils, focus coils, and video amplifier; the electronics\nmodule, containing video processing circuits, sweep generators, shutter drive, switching\nand timing circuits, and power converters; and the FM transmitter. Major control and\ntiming functions are provided by the spacecraft programmer and command distribution\nunit (CDU).\nA Tegea Kinoptic, 108-degree, wide-angle lens is used with an electromagnetically controlled focal plane type shutter. Exposure time will nominally be 1.5 milliseconds, reducing smear because of the spacecraft\'s spin to the order of 1 TV line. The camera\nhousing is magnetically shielded to protect against adverse effects of both earth and\nspacecraft magnetic fields.\n\nA-1\n\nHOR IZON\nCROSSING INDICATORS\n\n(2)\n\nMAGNETIC BIAS AND\n\n.\n\nMASC\nCOIL\n\nMECHAN I SM\nMASC COIL\n\n2 CHANNEL\nAllITUDE HORIZON\nDIGITAL\nSOLAR-ASPECT\nSENSOR\nINDICATOR\nSENSOR\nFigure A-1\n\nCROSSING\nINDICATORS ( 2 )\n\n- Structure and Controls Mounting\n\nThe 1-inch diameter vidicon operates on a basis of long-term image retention by the\nphotoconductor. To obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio under the very slow readout\nconditions characteristic of the APT, a pulsed-beam readout method is used. The video\nis converted from an amplitude-modulated pulse stream to an analog format after\namplification.\nThe faceplate of the vidicon has reticle marks which appear in the video format. These\nmarks aid in relating the picture to an actual position on the earth\'s surface.\nThe 208-second picture readout cycle is divided into two basic periods. During the first\n8 seconds, a "start" tone horizontal phasing pulses are generated while the vidicon is\nprepared and exposed. During the 200 seconds which follow, the vidicon is read out at a\n4-lines-per-second rate, producing an 800-line picture with scan lines perpendicular to\nthe orbit track.\nThe video baseband signal amplitude modulates a 2400-cps subcarrier producing a double\nsideband signal with a spectrum from 800 cps to 4000 cps. This subcarrier signal modulates the FM transmitter. A video coupler provides redundancy cross-strapping between\ncameras and transmitters.\nThe FM transmitter is deviated it10 kc maximum and produces a minimum 5 watts output\nat a c a r r i e r frequency of 137.500 Mc. Transmission bandwidth will be less than 30 kc.\nFour o r eight APT pictures per orbit may be programmed at 64-spin intervals (nominally\n352 seconds apart).\n\nA- 2\n\na-\n\na\n\nFigure A-2\n\n- Baseplate Layout\n\n.\n\na\n\nA-3\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nT\nFigure A-3\n\n- APT Spacecraft\n\nA- 4\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\nELECTRODE VOLTAGES.

There will be approximately 30 percent overlap between\npictures taken along the track. Pictures on successive orbits will be contiguGus at the\nequator with a growing overlap as the latitude increases and the successive orbit tracks\nconverge.\n\nDepending on their latitude, APT stations will receive pictures from two o r three consecutive passes each day. It is expected that these stations will have a 10- to 15-minute\ncontact time for approximately 50 to 75 percent of the orbits during which the spacecraft\nis in view of the station. Since at least one complete picture may be received in 10 minutes,\neach station has an excellent opportunity to obtain a picture of the local daytime cloudcover\neach day.\nThe location o the center of the picture can be determined at the APT station with a\nf\nknowledge of spacecraft ephemeris and time of picture receipt. With known fixed deviation\nbeing considered, the station should be able to locate the picture center to within 15 miles\non the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\n\n.\n\nFigure A-5\n\n- Typical APT Camera Coverage\nA-6\n\n3.\n\nATTITUDE AND DYNAMICS\n\nThe TOS spacecraft incorporates techniques to provide precise attitude control, camera\npointing, spin-rate control, and timing functions.\n3.1 ATTITUDE CONTROL\nThe pictures must be taken when the camera optical axis is collinear to within 1 degree\nd the local vertical, i.e., looking straight down, anywhere in the sunlit portion of the\norbit.\nThe spacecraft spin axis, in orbit, will be maintained normal to the orbital plane to within\n1 degree. The view axes of the two cameras are mounted normal to the spin axis; there~ E P , IC Lhe spacecrzft rotztes &u?iit itis axis, each camera alternately looks toward and\naway from the earth. The wheel attitude w i l l be established and accurately maintained\nwith the quarter-orbit magnetic attitude control (QOMAC), magnetic bias control (MBC),\nand nutation dampers.\nQOMAC uses a current-carrying coil t o generate a controlled magnetic field which interacts with the earth\'s magnetic field to torque the spinning spacecraft. The programmer,\nafter instructions from the ground station, reverses the direction of the current in the\ncoil each quarter orbit. The phasing o these switching points will be controlled so that\nf\nfor over half an orbit the nominal average torque axis position and direction of torque are\ncontrollable.\n\nMJ3C will be used to eliminate any unwanted spin axis drift in orbit; MBC will null the\nspacecraft\'s residual dipole moment and compensate for the effects of the regressing\norbit, thereby reducing the number of QOMAC cycles required for station keeping. The\nmagnitude and polarity of the dipole compensations afforded by MBC is controlled from\nthe ground by command.\n\nAn effective nutation damping system will be provided to rapidly reduce any imparted\nnutation to a negligible value. Two tuned energy-absorbing mass (TEAM) dampers will\nrapidly reduce any nutation cone half angle to a value below 0.7 degree. A liquid damper\nwill maintain the nutation angle at a level o the order of 0.2 degree. A low nutation angle\nf\nis desired for accuracy of camera aiming and for facilitating the processing of data from\nthe V-head horizon sensor.\n3.2 ATTITUDE DETERMINATION AND CAMERA TRIGGER\n\n.\n\n3.2.1 V-HEAD HORIZON SENSORS\nFor satisfactory picture taking, the spin axis must be maintained normal to the orbit\nplane and the camera shutter must be triggered at the desired instant in the rotation.\nSpin axis attitude is determined from telemetry of outputs from both channels of the attitude horizon sensor (AHS)and from a telemetered digital solar aspect (DSAI) sensor\noutput. Telemetered data from the horizon crossing indicator (HCI) may also be used to\nderive attitude data. The solar aspect sensor is most useful in initial maneuvers when\nboth channels of the V-head sensor do not intersect the earth, or in the event of failure of\none of the V-head elements. When the V-head scanner data is used and nutation is allowed\nfor, the uncertainty in roll and yaw at time of shutter should be less than 0.5 degree.\nThe A H S contains two infrared bolometers with optical axes in a V-configuration (Figure A-6). The optical paths of the sensors may intersect with the earth as the spacecraft\nspins; measurement of the earth- sky time ratios between the pulses is used to determine\nspin axis attitude. The digital solar aspect indicator produces a code indicative o the\nf\nsolar aspect angle once each rotation of the spacecraft. Resolution is 1 degree over a\n128-degree range.\nA-7\n\nSPIN AXIS\n\nr\n\nA H S - 1 OPTICS LINE OF SIGHT\n\n7\n\nA H S - 2 OPTICS LINE OF SIGHT\n\n-ORBIT\n\nPLANE\n\nEARTH\'S CURVATURE\n\n( A ) NO ROLL ERROR\n\n( B ) ROLL ERROR\n\nEARTH I R\nHORIZON\n\nAHS NO. 2 TRACK\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nHOR I ZON\nTRANSITIONS\n\nI\nI\n\nHORIZON\nTRANS ITIONS\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nSENSOR\nNO 1\nOUTPUT\n\nSENSOR\nNO 2\nOUTPUT\n\nHORIZON\nTRANSITIONS\n\nFigure A-6\n\n- Attitude Horizon Sensor Geometry\n\nA- a\n\nHOR I ZON\nTRANSITIONS\n\ne-\n\nData from the AHS will be transmitted continuously, in real time, on two of the three\nSCO\'s of the telemetry transmitter, each channel of the AHS on its own SCO. DSAI will\nbe timeshared on the third SCO with the HCI and other functions.\n\n3.2.2 HORIZON CROSSING INDICATORS (HCI)\nSeparate infrared horizon crossing indicator (HCI) sensors a r e used to trigger t h e camera\nshutter (Figure A-7). The HCI\'s have view axes normal to the spin axis; a pair is mounted\nwith view axes 180 degrees apart and interconnected so that only the :exling edge Qf t!\n!e\nsky-earth transition is controlling.\nA pair, in conjunction with a horizon synchronized counter device, afford phasing of camera\nfunction with spin, where necessary, including the shutter action. Because the redundant\ncameras are ais0 mmmteci 18C degxes apart, 2 sensor p i r may be used with either camera\nby command control of the phasing between camera and sensor pair. The angle between\nthe sensor view axis and camera view axis (angle a , Figure A-7) is adjusted to be equivalent to half the angle subtended by the earth at the nominal altitude (750 nm) of the\nspacecraft. This reduces the signal processing required, because the camera will be\nlooking straight down at the instant the sensor passes through the sky-earth transition\npoint. Therefore, the triggering of the shutter will occur simultaneously with the transition\npulse. The random deviation of this pulse from nominal w i l l be of the order of k0.5 degree\nat 750 nm.\nIf nominal altitude is not achieved, pictures will not be taken when the camera is looking\nvertical. For orbits varying 50 nm from nominal, this "pitch" error will be of the order\nof 1 degree. It will be a known factor, therefore correctable in data processing.\n\na\n\n3.3 SPIN RATE CONTROL\nThe spin period of the spacecraft is 5.50 f 0.025 seconds, which is the prepare period of\nthe APT camera. The spin rate is controlled by the MASC device. The spin decay is\nnominally 0.1 rpm per week (approximately 0.060 seconds in period) which can be counteracted with 15 minutes of MASC operation per week. Therefore short bursts of MASC\noperation on a once-a-day basis can hold the spin period within the k0.025-second tolerance.\nHC I\nSET NO. 1\n\nLINE OF\n\nSlGtiT\nFOR CAMERAS\n\nHCI\n\nSET NO. 2\nFigure A-7\n\n- Orthogonal Horizon Sensors\nA-9\n\nThe MASC device is a current-carrying coil mounted in the hat assembly, with the nornialto-the coil plane perpendicular to the spin axis; the HCI p a i r s commutate the coil current\nabout the local vertical.\nThe MASC operation is command controllable to afford either spinup or spindown. Average\nspin period over a 5-minute interval may be determined to within less than 1 millisecond\nby use of the telemetered output of the HCI, the AHS sensor output, o r the DSAI output.\n3.4 TIMING FUNCTIONS\n\nSpin rate is used to control picturetaking time, orbit counting, and other programmer\nfunctions to within a half-spin per orbit. Therefore, operational programming will be\nbased on spin count from a given point in the orbit. Flexibility in the programmer affords\nproper picturetaking and orbit timing well beyond the spin-rate variation within which the\nc a m e r a s will perform satisfactorily.\n\n3.5 INITIAL ACQUISITION O F ATTITUDE AND SPIN\nThe spacecraft and the vehicle third stage spin at a nominal 126 rpm during third-stage\nburn and before separation. After separation the nutation dampers a r e released to reduce\nspacecraft wobble and a yo-yo despin mechanism is released to reduce the spin rate to\napproximately 10.9 rpm. Spinup rockets or MASC may be used to increase the spin rate,\nif necessary.\nAfter orbital injection, a maneuver to orient the spin axis to orbit normal will be initiated\non orbit 0001, using the high-torque QOMAC mode of 10-degrees precession per orbit\n(Figure A-8). A maximum of four orbits of QOMAC can be programmed on the f i r s t\nacquisition.\n\nORIENTATION\nAT SEPARATION\n\nI-{:\n\n-\n\nx\nI\n\nATTITUDE\nTORQUING\nPHASE\n\n6 TH ORBIT\n\n/-\n\n-\\-\n\n-1OTH\n\nORBIT\n\ni,\n\nWHEEL O R I E N T A T I O N\n\nFigure A-8-\n\nTypical Wheel Orientation Maneuver (Orbit numbers are approximate)\n\nA-10\n\nOnce the spacecraft precesses to wit\'hin 10 degrees of orbit normal, the QOMAC device\nwill be switched to the low-torque mode, 2 degrees per orbit, and the MASC will be\nactuated to adjust the spin period. Low and high speed modes are available for MASC.\nAfter attitude and spin-rate acquisition, the spin axis will be permitted to drift for a day,\nDuring this period, the precession direction and rate will be monitored to determine the\nresidual magnetic bias of t h e spacecraft. MBC will then be energized and adjusted to\nestablish a new dipole moment, which will induce an approximately 1-degree-a-day\nprecession rate.\n4.\n\nPROGRAMMER\n\nThe programmer is a small computer incorporating digital micrologic modules in a\nf\nclock logic arrangement (Figure A-9). It will be turned on and o f and programmed by a\nCDA station through the command subsystem.

Both functions may be accomplished simultaneously with both programm e r s operating,\nThe programmer has the capability of:\n0\n\n0\n\nControlling the number of pictures to be taken on each orbit and the interval between\npictures. Either a 4- or 8-picture sequence may be programmed at an interval of\n352 seconds (64 spins) between pictures.\n\n0\n\nTurning camera power off at the end of a sequence, and restarting the cycle in the\nnext orbit. Therefore, the orbit period becomes a basic timing cycle. Orbit periods\nwhich may be accommodated with nominal spin-rates will be from approximately\n94 minutes to 188 minutes (1024 to 2048 spins). The programmer will repeat the\nsequence each orbit until turned off o r reprogrammed by ground command.\n\n0\n\nProviding synchronization of spacecraft operations with the spacecraft spin-rate,\nautomatically rephasing if synchronization is disturbed, and providing backup\nhorizon crossing pulses if the HCI output pulses a r e interrupted, thereby permitting\nthe satellite spin-rate to be a timing source. A horizon sync counter is synchronized\nto the sky-earth transition pulse output of the orthogonal horizon sensor. It discriminates against earth noise pulses which may follow this leading edge pulse by means of\na gating operation using outputs from the HCI. The output is one pulse per spin of\nthe spacecraft, generated in phase with the output of the HCI associated with the\ncamera being used. Perfect synchronization will be afforded with spin periods\nvarying from 5.12 seconds up to 100 milliseconds longer than the nominal 5.5seconds spin period.\n\n0\n\nProviding quarter-orbit timing and control of number of cycles for @MAC operation. In the QOMAC mode the programmer is not synchronized to horizon pulses,\nbecause the horizon sync counter is programmed to operate in a f r e e running mode\nat the nominal spin rate. This is necessary because in the initial orientation maneuvers immediately after launch the orthogonal horizon sensors do not s e e the\nearth. Quarter-orbit periods which may be accommodated a r e from 24 to 47 minutes.\n\n0\n\nProviding synchronized control of the camera subsystems. The outputs of the programmer supply power control of camera and transmitter, initiation of prepare\ncycle, shutter trigger, and gated timing.\n\n0\n\n5.\n\nInitiating picturetaking and attitude-correction cycles at a point remote from the\nCDA station. The delay is derived from spin count and will be a maximum of about\n188 minutes.\n\nProviding the precise frequencies required.

After enabling, a digital spacecraft address is\ntransmitted, followed by the digital command. The outputs of the redundant decoders appear on matrices which are ORed in the CDU before distribution. When a load programmer command is received and is followed by a normal bit stream, the system stays\nopen until the programmer is completely filled.\nIf the signal drops out for a short period, o r if a suitable spacecraft address is not re-\n\nceived within a given period, the decoder power is removed and the subsystem reverts to\na standby condition. Receipt of an improper code causes the decoder registers to reset.\nData is transmitted by a single FSK tone on an amplitude-modulated c a r r i e r using returnto-zero (RZ) binary code. N o synchronism is required between ground station and spacecraft except in timing program commands to ensure proper start time of program. The\nsatellite\'s spin period is used as the basic timing at the ground station.\n\n6.\n\nCOMMAND DISTRIBUTION UNIT (CDU)\n\nThe outputs of the redundant command decoder matrices are ORed in the CDU (Figure\nA-10) for redundancy selection, power control for subsystems, attitude and spin control\nswitching, and many other functions. Programmer sequenced signals are routed to the\ncamera subsystem through this unit. The satellite\'s spin period is used for basic CDU\ntiming along with onboard time generators.\n7.\n\nTELEMETRY SUBSYSTEM\n\nThe telemetry subsystem (Figure A-11) transmits attitude sensor data, command verification, and operating condition (housekeeping) data f o r all subsystems.

After 6 months in orbit this\nfigure is expected to drop to 1.4 amps due to radiation damage.\nThe solar array consists of approximately 10,000 1x2 cm, N-on-P solar cells mounted\non the outer surface of the hat, with a nominal efficiency of 9 percent, air mass zero.\nThe cells are assembled in s e r i e s parallel; the number of cells in a s e r i e s string\nvaries over the spacecraft surface to provide optimum power match, particularly after\ndegradation.\nThe battery packs consist of 4-amp-hour, rectangular, nickel-cadmium cells connected\nin s e r i e s strings of 21 cells. Three a r e used on the TOS APT to permit loss of one\nbattery pack without sacrificing the mission.\nProtection is afforded by shunt limiters on the array output and charge-rate controllers,\nwhich maintain the array output voltage below a safe level of -33 volts. A charge-rate\ncontroller associated with each battery pack, commandable to a normal charge rate of\n400-milliamp per battery pack o r to a 50 percent higher charge rate.\nA regulated output bus is provided at 24.5 f 0.5 volts. Redundant regulators a r e provided,\nswitchable upon command. The regulator receives its input from the regulated bus and\nhas a 5-amp output capability.\nA separate unregulated bus will also be used for high, momentary loads, such as for\nshutters, isolating these transient loads. Current for the unregulated bus is supplied by\nthe solar array and batteries in a parallel arrangement. In orbit daytime, the solar array\nfurnishes power for both battery charging and system loads. The batteries supply additional power for high peak loads and orbit nighttime.\n9.\n\nSPACECRAFT COMMUNICATIONS\n\nThree spacecraft/ground station communication links a r e used in TOS APT. Commands\na r e transmitted by means of a 250-w minimum output AM transmitter and a 9-db minimum\ngain, circularly polarized, tracking antenna at the CDA station. The spacecraft command\nreception antenna is the crossed dipole mounted below the spacecraft baseplate. The\nsame command radio frequency and modulation tones ,will be used for all spacecraft since\neach will have a unique address code. With nominal attitude and altitude and 5-degree\ntracking antenna elevation, this system will have an operating margin of the order of 9 db.\nThe crossed-dipole antenna used for telemetry transmissions and as a tracking beacon is\nomnidirectional to within nominally +6 db. It transmits a 136.770-Mc, 250-mw, P M signal\ncontinuously, but may be turned on and off by command.\nThe FM transmitter generates 5 w at 137.500 Mc, using the monopole antenna on the hat.\nAt nominal attitude and altitude, the worst case spacecraft antenna gain is approximately\n-4 db. Transmission bandwidth will be of the order of 30 kc.\n\nA-16\n\nAppendix B\n\nAVCS SPACECRAFT\n1.

It is an 18-sided right polyhedron, 22.5\ninches high and 42 inches in diameter, consisting o a reinforced baseplate carrying most\nf\nsubsystems and a cover assembly (hat) with solar cells mounted on the outer top and\nsides; dynamics control coils and nutation dampers are mounted inside the hat (Figure\nB-1). Openings in the hat are provided for the various sensors mounted on the baseplate.\nHORIZON\n\n.-.\n\nMAGNETIC BIAS AND\n\nMASC\nCOIL\n\nATTITUDE HORIZON\nDIG1\nSDUR-ASPfCT\nSENSOR\nINDICATOR\nSENSOR\nFigure B-1\n\nINDICATORS (21\n\n- Structure and Controls Mounting\nB- 1\n\nFigure 8-2\n\n- AVCS\n\nkseplate Layout\n\nA crossed-dipole antenna projects from the bottom of the baseplate and a monopole\nantenna projects vertically from the top center of the hat.\n\nThe entire assembly is strengthened to accommodate the severe launch vibration environment and to provide margin for future growth.\nBecause it is spin-stabilized, the spacecraft is carefully balanced to ensure proper orientation of the spin axis with respect to the sensor view axis.\nThe AVCS configuration is the basic spacecraft carrying two redundant AVCS equipments.\nFigure B-2 is the baseplate layout; Figure B-3 is a spacecraft block diagram. The AVCS\nis a camera, tape recorder, transmitter combination designed to record a series of\nremote, daytime cloudcover pictures for subsequent playback to a large data acquisition\nfacility. The camera and tape recorder a r e essentially the same as those employed in\nNimbus. A s configured for TOS, the major elements of the subsystem are the camera\nassembly, camera electronics, camera controller, tape recorder, and transmitter.\nMajor control and timing functions a r e provided by the spacecraft programmer and command distribution unit.\nB-2\n\nE\n\nE\nm\n\n.:\n:\nm\n0\n\nn\n\nY\n\nY\nc\n\n3\n0\n\nu\n\n7\n\nE\n0\n0\n\ni\n\ntn\ntn\n\nU\n\n>\nQ\nI\n\n0\n\nm\nP)\n3\n\nL\n\nm\n.-\n\nLL\n\nB-3\n\nThe IR subsystem consists of a flat plate radiometer, an incremental recorder, and\nassociated record/playback electronics.\n2.

The camera housing will be magnetically shielded to negate the adverse effects of\nuncontrolled magnetic fields.\nThe 1-inch vidicon h a s an inherent storage property which permits a nominal 6.5-second\nframe scan time. Concurrent with shutter actuation, a flash tube of known intensity exposes a 16-increment gray scale on each frame for picture calibration.\n?he camera electronics comprise video amplifiers, deflection generators, power converters, a n d other ancillary circuits. The composite video output from the electronics is\nproduced at a 133-1/3-line-per-second rate with a video bandwidth of 60 kc and a dynamic\nrange o f 50 to 1. Horizontal sync pulses are provided at all times.\nB-4\n\nA nominal frame of video comprises 0.25 seconds of blanked video followed by 6.25 seconds of vidicon scan video (833 lines) and a final 0.25-period of blanked video.\nA precise flutter and wow correction tone is generated to permit compensation for the\nvagaries of the tape recorders in the system when the final picture presentation is made.\nThis flutter and wow tone is gated so as to appear only during the nominal frame time,\nthereby acting as a "vertical sync."\n\nUpon command to playback, the tape recorder runs in the opposite direction from recording. A s a result, the first picture recorded in the CDA station is the last picture\ntaken by the camera.\n\nTwo tape recorders will be carried; to afford cross-strapped redundancy the track assignments on both are the same, with inputs paralleled. Track 1 records camera 1 output;\ntrack 2 records camera 2 output; track 3 records flutter and wow tone; and track 4 records a frame of picture time code and commutated telemetry.\nF M recording of video is accomplished by applying the 60-kc video baseband to the input\nof a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) with center frequency at 192 kc, maximum deviation *48 kc. Since it is inefficient to record this high a frequency spectrum, the VCO\noutput is divided by two before recording. On playback the video modulated F M signal\nwith spectrum limited to a maximum of 120 kc is not doubled to its original state until it\nreaches the ground station. This not only conserves RF spectrum on transmission, but\nik\naffords a more efficient communications ln.\n\nThe flutter and wow tone is recorded as a 38.4-kc unmodulated signal. On playback it is\ndivided by four to 9.6 kc to permit multiplexing with the video for transmission.\nTo record a frame of time and telemetry, the output of the appropriate telemetry subc a r r i e r oscillator (SCO) is recorded in a manner similar to that of the picture data recording. Upon playback, the tape recorder output is demodulated onboard, thus recovering the original SCO signal. This signal is then transmitted to ground via the telemetry\ntransmitter simultaneously with transmission of video data via the AVCS transmitter.\n\nThe camera controller accepts power and timing inputs from the programmer and CDU,\nprocessing them for distribution throughout the AVCS. The controller also processes\ntelemetry signals before they are fed to the telemetry commutator. A video combiner\npermits cross-strapping redundant camera/tape recorders with the redundant transmitters.\nThe AVCS transmitter accepts multiplexed video subcarrier and flutter and wow tone\nfrom the video tape recorder and radiometric data from the IR recorder. It is deviated\na maximum o *125 kc at a carrier frequency of 235.000 Mc. Transmission bandwidth\nf\nwill be a maximum of 500 kc. Including the between-picture gap, a nominal transmission time of 10 seconds for each recorded picture will be required. On interrogation\nafter a blind orbit, 24 pictures will be recorded, requiring a 4-minute playback. The\ntape recorder can be read out between picturetaking cycles without losing a picture or\ninterrupting a sequence.\nDirect pictures (recorder VCO output before recording) may be obtained for diagnostic\npurposes through this transmitter link also.\nSix or twelve AVCS pictures per orbit may be programmed at 40 spin (260 second) intervals. The 833-line pictures at nominal altitude and attitude will cover an area o 1700 nm\nf\nB- 5\n\non a side (Figure B-5). There will be 50 percent picture overlap along the track, and the\npictures from successive orbits will be contiguous at the equator with a growing overlap\nas the latitude increases and the orbit tracks converge; complete coverage is thereby\nensured. Playback of the radiometer data is ground controlled.\n\nFigure B-5\n\n- AVCS\n\nCamera Coverage\n\n3. ATTITUDE AND DYNAMICS\nThe TOS spacecraft incorporates techniques to provide precise attitude control, camera\npointing, spin-rate control, and timing functions.\n3.1 ATTITUDE CONTROL\nThe pictures must be taken when the camera optical axis is colinear to within 1 degree\nof the local vertical, i.e., looking straight down, anywhere in the sunlit portion of the\norbit.\nThe spacecraft spin axis, in orbit, will be maintained normal to the orbital plane to\nwithin 1 degree. The view axes of the two cameras are mounted normal to the spin axis;\ntherefore, as the spacecraft rotates about its axis, each camera alternately looks toward\nand away from the earth. The wheel attitude will be established and accurately maintained\n\nB-6\n\nwith the quarter-orbit magnetic attitude control (QOMAC), magnetic bias control (MBC),\nand nutation dampers.\n\n.\n\nQOMAC uses a current-carrying coil to generate a controlled magnetic field which interacts with the earth\'s magnetic field to torque the spinning spacecraft. The programmer,\nf\nafter instructions from the ground station, r e v e r s e s the direction o the current of the\ncurrent in the coil each quarter orbit. The phasing of these switching points w i l l be controlled so that for over half an orbit the nominal average torque axis position and direction of torque are controllable.\n\nMBC will be used to eliminate any unwanted spin axis drift in orbit; MBC will null the\nspacecraft\'s residuai dipoie moment am?corr?pe~satp the effects of the regressing\nfor\norbit, thereby reducing the number o QOMAC cycles required for station keeping. The\nf\nmagnitude and polarity of the dipole compensations afforded by Ml3C is controlled from\nthe ground by command.\nAn effective nutation damping system will be provided to rapidly reduce any imparted\nnutation to a negligible value. Two tuned energy-absorbing mass (TEAM)\ndampers will\nrapidly reduce any nutation cone half angle to a value below 0.7 degree. A liquid damper\nwill maintain the nutation angle at a level of the order of 0.2 degree. A low nutation angle\nis desired for accuracy of camera aiming and for facilitating the processing of data from\nthe V-head horizon sensor.\n\n3.2 ATTITUDE DETERMINATION AND CAMERA TRIGGER\n3.2.1 V-HEAD HORIZON SENSORS\nFor satisfactory picture taking, the spin axis must be maintained normal to the orbit\nplane and the camera shutter must be triggered at the desired instant in the rotation.\nSpin axis attitude is determined from telemetry of outputs from both channels of the\nattitude horizon sensor ( A B ) and from a telemetered digital solar aspect indicator (DSAI)\noutput. Telemetered data from the horizon crossing indicator (HCI) may also be used to\nderive attitude data. The solar aspect sensor is most useful in initial maneuvers when\nboth channels of the V-head sensor do not intersect the earth, or in the event of failure Of\none of the V-head elements. When the V-head scanner data is used and nutation is allowed\nfor, the uncertainty in roll and yaw at t i m e of shutter should be less than 05 degree.\n.\nThe AHS contains two infrared bolometers with optical axes in a V-configuration (Figure\nB-6). The optical paths of the sensors may intersect with the earth as the spacecraft\nspins; measurement of the earth-sky time ratios between the pulses is used to determine\nspin axis attitude. The digital solar aspect indicator produces a code indicative of the\nsolar aspect angle once each rotation o the spacecraft. Resolution is 1 degree over a\nf\n128-degree range.\nData from the AHS will be transmitted continuously, in real time, on two o the three\nf\nSCO\'s o the telemetry transmitter, each channel of the AHS on its own SCO. DSAI will\nf\nbe timeshared on the third SCO with the HCI and other functions.\n3.2.2 HORIZON CROSSING INDICATORS (HCI)\nSeparate infrared horizon crossing indicator (HCI) sensors are used to trigger the c a m e r a\nshutter (Figure B-7). The HCI\'s have view axes normal t o the spin axis; a pair is mounted\nwith view axes 180 degrees apart and interconnected so that only the leading edge of the\nsky-earth transition is controlling.\n\nB-7\n\nSPIN AXIS\n\nTL\n\n\':=\n**\n\nA H S - 2 OPTICS LINE OF SIGHT\n\n-\n\nORBIT PLANE\n\nEARTH\'S CURVATURE\'\n\n( A ) NO ROLL ERROR\n\n(B\n\nROLL ERROR\n\nEARTH I R\nHORIZON\n\nEARTH I R\nHORIZON\n\nAHS NO. 2 TRACK\nHS NO. 2 TRAC\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nA\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nSENSOR\nNO 1\nOUTPUT\nI\n\nNOISE\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nSENSOR\nNO 2\nOUTPUT\n\nHORIZON\nTRANSITIONS\n\nHOR I ZON\nTRANSITIONS\n\nFigure\n\nHOR I ZON\nTRANSITIONS\n\n8-6 -Attitude\n\nSensor Geometry\n\nB-8\n\nHORIZON\nTRANSITIONS\n\nORTHOGONAL\nHORIZON SENSOR\nSET NO. 1\n\n1\n\n,LINE\nO SIGHT\nF\nFOa C M R S\nA EA\n\nHORIZON SENSOR\\\nSET NO. 2\n\nFigure 8-7\n\n- Orthogonal Horizon Sensor\n\nThe pair, in conjunction with a horizon synchronized counter device, affords phasing o\nf\ncamera function with spin, where necessary, including the shutter action. Because the\nredundant cameras are also mounted 180 degrees apart, a sensor pair may be used with\neither camera by command control of the phasing between camera and sensor pair. The\nangle between the sensor view axis and camera view axis (angle a , Figure B-7) is adjusted\nto be equivalent to half the angle subtended by the earth at the nominal altitude (750 nm)\nof the spacecraft. This reduces the signal processing required, because the camera will\nbe looking straight down at the instant the sensor passes through the sky-earth transition\npoint. Therefore, the triggering of the shutter will occur simulataneously with the transition pulse. The random deviation of this pulse from nominal will be of the order of & 0.5\ndegree at 750 nm. (Sensor pair A will provide pictures looking straight down, sensor\npair B will provide pictures looking 15 degrees offset from vertical along the track.)\nIf nominal altitude is not achieved, pictures will not be taken when the camera is looking\nvertical. For orbits varying 50 nm from nominal, this "pitch" e r r o r will be of the order\nof 1 degree. It will be a known factor, therefore correctable in data processing.\n\n3.3 SPIN RATE CONTROL\nThe spin period of the spacecraft is 6.50 +0.025 seconds, the period of one AVCS picture\nreadout. The spin rate is controlled by a MASC device. The spin decay can be counteracted with MASC operation. Short bursts of MASC operation on a once-a-day basis can\nhold the spin period within the lt0.025-second tolerance.\n\nThe MASC device is a current-carrying coil mounted in the hat assembly, with the\nnormal-to-the coil plane perpendicular to the spin axis; the HCI pairs commutate the\ncoil current about the local vertical.\nThe MASC operation is command controllable to afford either spinup or spindown.\nAverage spin period over a 5-minute interval may be determined to within less than 1\nmillisecond by use of the telemetered output of the HCI,and AHS sensor output, or the\nDSAI output.\nB- 9\n\n3.4 TIMING FUNCTIONS\nSpin rate is used to control picturetaking time, orbit counting, and other programmer\nfunctions to within a half-spin per orbit. Therefore, operational programming will be\nbased on spin count from a given point in the orbit. Flexibility in the programmer affords\nproper picturetaking and orbit timing well beyond the spin-rate variation within which the\ncameras will perform satisfactorily.\n3.5 INITIAL ACQUISITION OF ATTITUDE AND SPIN\nThe spacecraft and the vehicle third stage spin at a nominal 126 rpm during third-stage\nburn and before separation. After separation the nutation dampers a r e released to reduce\nspacecraft wobble and a yo-yo despin mechanism is released to reduce the spin r a t e to\napproximately 10.9 rpm. Spinup rockets o r MASC may be used to increase the spin rate,\nif necessary.\n\nAfter orbital injection, a maneuver to orient the spin axis to orbit normal will be initiated\non orbit 0001, using the high-torque QOMAC mode of 10-degrees precession per orbit\n(Figure B-8). A maximum of four orbits of QOMAC can be programmed on the f i r s t\nacquisition.\nOnce the spacecraft precesses to within 10 degrees of orbit normal, the QOMAC device\nwill be switched to the low-torque mode, 2 degrees per orbit, and the MASC will be\nactuated to adjust the spin period. Low and high speed modes a r e available for MASC.;\n\n/\n\nORIENTATION\nAT SEPARATION\n\n-\n\n6TH ORBIT\n\n/-\n\nx\\i\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\\\nATTITUDE\nTORQUING\nPHASE\n\nI\n\n/\n\nI\nI\nL---\n\nWHEEL ORIENTATION\n\nFigure 8-8 -Wheel\n\nOrientation Maneuver\n\nB- 10\n\n/\n\nA f t e r attitude and spin-rate acquisition, the spin axis will be permitted to drift for a day.\nDuring this period, the precession direction and r a t e will be monitored to determine the\nf\nresidual magnetic bias o the spacecraft. MBC will then be energized and adjusted to\nestablish a new dipole moment, which will induce an approximately 1-degree-a-day precession rate.\n\n4.\n\nPROGRAMMER\n\nThe programmer is a small computer incorporating digital micrologic modules in a\nclock logic arrangement (Figure B-9). It will be turned on and off and programmed by a\nCDA station through the command subsystem.

The delay is derived from s p h count and w i l l be a maximum of about\n222 minutes.\n\n0\n\nControlling the number of pictures to be taken on each orbit and the interval\nbetween pictures. Either a 6- or 12-picture sequence may be programmed at an\ninterval of 260 seconds (40 spins) between pictures.\n\n0\n\nTurning camera power off at the end of a sequence, and restarting the cycle in the\nnext orbit. Therefore, the orbit period becomes a basic timing cycle. Orbit\nperiods which may be accommodated with nominal spin-rates will be from approximately 69 minutes to 180 minutes (641 to 1684 spins). The programmer will repeat\nthe sequence each orbit until turned off o r reprogrammed by ground command.\nProviding synchronization of spacecraft operations with the spacecraft spin-rate,\nautomatically rephasing if synchronization is disturbed, and providing backup\nhorizon crossing pulses if the HCI output pulses a r e interrupted, thereby permitting the satellite spin-rate to be a timing source. A horizon sync counter is\nsynchronized to the sky-earth transition pulse output of the orthogonal horizon\nsensor. It discriminates against earth noise pulses which may follow this leading\nedge pulse by means of a gating operation using outputs from the HCI. The output\nis one pulse per spin of the spacecraft, generated in phase with the output of the\nHCI associated with the camera being used. Perfect synchronization will be afforded\nwith spin periods varying from 5.12 seconds up to 100 milliseconds longer than the\nnominal 6.5-seconds spin.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5.\n\na\n\nProviding quarter-orbit timing and control of number of cycles for QOMAC operation. In the QOMAC mode the programmer is not synchronized to horizon pulses,\nbecause the horizon sync counter is programmed to operate in a free running mode\na t the nominal spin rate. This is necessary because in the initial orientation maneuv e r s immediately after launch the orthogonal horizon sensors do not s e e the earth.\nQuarter-orbit periods which may be accommodated a r e from 28 to 56 minutes.\nProviding synchronized control of the camera subsystems. The outputs of the\nprogrammer supply the camera with horizontal sync, vertical sync, power control,\nshutter and flash tube trigger pulses, gated timing signals, and tape recorder\ncontrol.\nCOMMAND SUBSYSTEM\n\nThe command subsystem comprises two redundant fixed-tuned AM receivers/tone detect o r s and decoder units. The receiver and tone detectors operate continuously, while the\ndecoder is powered upon receipt of a particular enable tone, different f o r each of the\nredundant decoders. After enabling, a digital spacecraft address is transmitted, followed\nby the digital command. The outputs of the redundant decoders appear on matrices which\na r e ORed in the CDU before distribution. When a load programmer command is received\nand is followed by a normal bit stream, the system stays open until the programmer is\ncompletely filled.\nIf the signal drops out for a short period, o r if a suitable spacecrak address is not received within a given period, the decoder power is removed and the subsystem reverts\nto a standby condition. Receipt of an improper code causes the decoder registers to reset.\n\nB- 1 2\n\n\'\n\nl\n\nData is transmitted by a single FSK tone on an amplitude-modulated carrier using returnto-zero (RZ) binary code. No synchronism is required between ground station and spacecraft except i n timing program commands to ensure proper start time of program. The\nsatellite\'s spin period is used as the basic timing a the ground station.\nt\n6.\n\n..\n\nCOMMAND DISTRIBUTION UNIT (CDU)\n\nThe outputs of the redundant command decoder matrices are ORed in the CDU (Figure B-10)\nfor redundancy selection, power control for subsystems, attitude and spin control switching, and many other functions. Programmer sequenced signals are routed to the camera\nsubsystem through this unit. The satellite\'s spin period is used for basic CDU timing along\nwit! mbeccd time generators.\n\nRECEIVER\nDECODER\nNO. 1\n\nMCARRIERw m ~AND\noDu\n\nI\n\n1\n\nDATA\n\nI\n\n4\n\nPROGRAMMER\nNo. 1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nHCI-1\n\nI\n\nREAL-TIME COMMANDS\nQOMAC AND CAMERA COMMANDS\n\nI\n\nMODULATED\nCARRIER\n\nH:$z\nII\n\nOUTPUTS\nMATRIX\n\nS\nE\nS I GNALS\n\ni\n\n4 1 4u\n1\nI\n\n- -\n\nCOMMAND\nRECEIVER\nAND DECODER\nNO. 2\n\nDATA\n\n1\n\nFigure B-10\n\n7.\n\nMASC COMMANDS\n\nPROGRAMMER\nNo. 2\n\nY\n\n~\n\nl HORIZON\nPULSES\n\nHCI -2\n\n- Command Distribution Unit\n\nTELEMETRY SUBSYSTEM\n\nThe telemetry subsystem (Figure B-11) transmits attitude sensor data, command verification, and operating condition (housekeeping) data for all subsystems. A phase modulated\ntransmitter at 136.770 Mc (which also serves as a tracking beacon) drives the crosseddipole antenna with 250 milliwatts nominal RF output. The transmitter is modulated by\nthree standard B I G F M subcarriers, which will carry the following on a time-shared\nbasis in the priority listed:\n0\n\nTimecode\n\n0\n\nHousekeeping data\n\n0\n\nCommand data verification\n\n0\n\nSolar aspect sensor\n\n0\n\nCamera trigger sensor (summed HCI), shutter actuation marker, and spin-control\noperation summed together\nB- 13\n\nI\n\nI UICMIM I\n\n01 I O\nHCI\nOIlA\n\nFigure B-11\n\n- Telemetry Subsystem\n\nA single commutated frame of telemetry will be produced upon receipt of a normal command o r receipt of a long-tone backup command and each time an AVCS picture is taken.\nIf the transmitters are powered, the frame is transmitted. The commutator is turned off\nat the end of each frame, and the system reverts to the next priority mode. Just before\nthe start of each frame of telemetry time code data is transmitted.\n\nWhenever coded command is being received, t h e data bits are automatically transmitted\nover the telemetry transmitter (provided a frame of commutated telemetry is not being\ngenerated). This verification begins immediately after receipt of valid command sync\nand automatically ceases when the last bit of a valid command is received in the registers.\nIf neither commutated telemetry nor command verification is transmitted, either digital\nsolar aspect data or a summed output is produced continuously, selectable by command.\n\nThe following appear as summed signals:\n0\n\nThe outputs of the HCI sensors, useful for spin-rate measurements and diagnostic\npurposes\n\n0\n\nThe shutter marker, again useful for diagnostic purposes because it indicates the\npoint on the sloping leading edge of the HCI output where the shutter was actuated\n\n0\n\nLevels indicating the MASC operating status\n\nB- 14\n\n8.\n\nPOWER SUPPLY SUBSYSTEM\n\nThe power supply subsystem comprises solar cells for source of all power, batteries to\ncarry peak and spacecraft night loads, protective circuits such as the charge rate controller and shunt limiters, output regulators, and the required fusing (Figure \xe2\x82\xac3-12). Power\noutput is available on both regulated and unregulated buses.\n\nI\n\n- c\n\nWith nominal orbital parameters and full mission operation, the array current output requirement is of the order of 0.8 amps. At nominal orbit beginning of life, the solar array\noutput is expected to be of the order o 2.4 amps. After 6 months in orbit this figure is\nf\nexpected to drop to 1.4 amps due to radiation damage.\n-24.5 VOLT\nREGULATOR\n\nNO.\n\n1\n\nHI-LEVEL\n\nCHARGf\nCOMMAND\n\nTO DECODER NO. 1\n\nTO CAMERA NO. 1\n\nSHUTTER cmcum\n\nTO CAMEU NO. 2 SHUTTER ClRCUll\nT C W FOR MAG-MAS SWITCH\nO\nSOLENOID DUNE CRCLJK\n\n1L\n4*\n\nSEPARATION- EVENT\nCiRCUllRY AND UIT-OFF BIAS\n\nFigure B-12-Power\n\nSubsystem\n\nThe solar array consists of approximately 10,000 1x2 cm, N-on-P solar cells mounted on\nthe outer surface of the hat, with a nominal efficiency of 9 percent, air mass zero. The\ncells are assembled in series parallel; the number of cells in a series string varies over\nthe spacecraft surface to provide optimum power match, particularly after degradation.\n\nTwo standard battery packs are used; each consists of 4-amphour, rectangular, nickelcadmium cells connected in series strings of 21 cells.\n\nB- 15\n\n,\nProtection is afforded by shunt limiters on the array output and charge-rate controllers,\nwhich maintain the a r r a y output voltage below a safe level of -33 volts.

Current f o r the unregulated bus is supplied by\nthe solar array and batteries in a parallel arrangement. In orbit daytime, the solar a r r a y\nfurnishes power for both battery charging and system loads. The batteries supply additional power for high peak loads and orbit nighttime.\n\n9.\nI\n\nI\n\nSPACECRAFT COMMUNICATIONS\n\nThree spacecraft/ground station communication links are used in TOS APT. Commands\na r e transmitted by means of a 250-w minimum output AM transmitter and a 9-db minimum\ngain, circularly polarized, tracking antenna at the CDA station. The spacecraft command\nreception antenna is the monopole at the top of the hat. The same command radio frequency\nand modulation tones will be used for all spacecraft since each will have a unique address\ncode. With nominal attitude and altitude and 5-degree tracking antenna elevation, this\nsystem will have an operating margin of the order of 9 db.\n\nI\n\nThe crossed-dipole antenna used for telemetry transmissions and as a tracking beacon is\nomnidirectional t o within nominally f 6 db. It transmits 136.770- MC 250-mw PM signal\ncontinuously, but may be turned on and off by command.\n\nI\n\nAll TOS AVCS spacecraft will use 5-w F M transmitters at 235.000 Mc. Transmission\nbandwidth will be of the order of 500 kc. Sleeves on the crossed-dipole antennas will\nafford transmission capability at this frequency. The pattern is omnidirectional to within\n56 db. The transmitter will be radiating only during AVCS tape recorder playback and\nwhen requesting a direct picture, nominally 2 to 4 minutes each orbit.\n\nB-16\n\nAppendix C\nVEHICLE\nThe TOS spacecraft will be launched by the improved Delta vehicle, DSV-3E, A s shown\nin Figure C-1. The Delta vehicles, built by Doublas Aircraft Company (DAC), are described in detail in the Delta project PDP. Specific vehicles and launching procedures\nfor each spacecraft will be described i n the Detailed Test Objectives (DTO) and Program\nRequirement Document (PRD).\nThe improved Delta is a three-stage vehicle with an overall length of approximately 91\nfeet and 2 F ~ ~ Y L Ek d. \'~dkiji&ei=oi 8 feet. Nommal launch weight is 136,000 pounds.\nYq\nThe first stage is a Douglas Aircraft Company (DAC) modified Thor missile (Rocketdyne\nMB-3 Block III)with three strap-on Thiokol TX 33-52 solid-rocket motors producing\n346,000 pounds of thrust. The second stage is an Aerojet General AJ10-118-E with\nliquid-propellant engine producing 6,000 to 7,800 pounds of thrust. A forward equipment\nand guidance compartment houses the WECO 600 radio-guidance system, the flight-vehicle\ncontroller, and other instrumentation. A spin table which supports the third stage is\nmounted at the forward end of the second stage. The third stage is an Allegany Ballistic\nLaboratory (ABL) X-258 solid-propellant rocket.\n1\nThe main propulsion system is Rocketdyne MB-3 Block 11 engine using LOX and RJ-1\npropellants. The main engine is gimballed for pitch and yaw attitude control from liftoff\nto main engine cutoff. Two 1,000-pound-thrust liquid propellant vernier engines provide\nroll control during main engine burning as well as picth, yaw, and roll attitude control\nfrom main engine cutoff t o first-to-second stage separation. A fire-in-the-hole technique is utilized in the first-to-second stage separation, which is initiated 4 seconds\nafter main engine cutoff.\n\nThe second stage is powered by an Aerojet General Corporation AJ10-118-E. The tankage diameter of the AJ10-118-E is 54.7 inches. The aft skirt attaches to the larger\ndiameter tankage. The guidance compartment structure is tapered from 54.7 inches at\nthe aft end to 60 inches at the forward end. The structure has the capability of supporting\na 1,200-pound payload on the spin-table support adapter o r a 2,000-pound payload at the\nperiphery of the 60-inch diameter. The liquid-propellant engine uses inhibited red\nfuming nitric acid (IRFNAJand unsymmetric dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) propellants.\nThe engine is gimballed for pitch and yaw attitude control. A cold gas system utilizing\nnitrogen gas and six fixed nozzles provides roll control during second-stage burning as\nwell as pitch, yaw, and roll control during the coast period and after second-stage engine\ncutoff. Two fixed nozzles fed by the propellant tank helium pressurization system bottles\nprovide retro thrust during second-to-third stage separation.\nThe third stage solid-propellant ABL X-258 is spin stabilized before separation from\nthe second stage. The third stage/spacecraft fairing attaches to the forward face of the\nguidance compartment structure and protects the third-stage motor and spacecraft from\naerodynamic heating during the boost flight. A spring is contained in the payload attach\nstructure for third-stage to spacecraft separation. A shroud is attached to the second\nstage for protection of the third stage and spacecraft during flight through the atmosphere.\nThe second-to-third stage connection consists of a spin table and petal arrangement fixed\nto the second stage and a band containing explosive bolts which hold the third stage on the\npetals. Spinup is accomplished by a set of rockets fixed to the spin table.\nFirst and second stage preprogrammed autopilots control the vehicle and sequence operations from liftoff to second-to-third stage separation.

The\ncoast phase rates are limited between 0.1 and 1.0 degrees per second.\n\nThe improved Delta separation schematic is shown in Figure C-2. At first-stage main\nengine shutdown, the blast bands covering the exhaust ports on both the First-stage transition section and adapter section are jettisoned. Approximately 4 seconds later, the firstto-second-stage explosive separation bolts are fired and second-stage ignition occurs.\nThe third-stage/spacecraft fairing is jettisoned approximately 10 seconds after secondstage ignition.

The ESSA CDA\nstations are at Fairbanks, Alaska (GILMOR), and Wallops Station, Va. (WALOMS). A\nground station at RCA-AED, Highstown, N. J. (RCAHNF), can receive transmissions from\nthe spacecraft but cannot command. This station is not part of the ground communications system. The GSFC R&D station antenna at Fairbanks, ULASKA, may be available\nupon request for GILMOR backup on a noninterference basis, according t o a reciprocal\nagreement between NASA and ESSA. A similar agreement exists with respect t o Wallops\nStation facilities. The CDA stations receive station schedules and spacecraft command\nprograms from TOC.\nNormally, beacon data and timing signals are transmitted from the CDA stations in real\ntime as they a r e received from the spacecraft. Video data are transmitted by playing the\ntape recorder back at 7-1/2 ips, 1/8th the recording speed. This reduces the subcarrier\ninstantaneous frequency range t o 18 t o 30 kc and the baseland to 7-1/2 kc. The flutter and\nwow subcarrier is, then, 6.25 kc. A slow-time demodulator is used for monitoring.\n1. GILMORE CREEK, ALASKA (GILMOR)\nEquipment at each CDA station includes an R F section, video section, spacecraft command and control equipment, beacon telemetry processing section, and tape recorders and\ncommunications terminals.

The surface, consisting of double-curved aluminum sheet panels, is\nseparate from the reflector structure t o permit independent adjustment. At 136 Mc,\nthe antenna has a gain of approximately 27 db with a 6-degree beamwidth; at 235 Mc, the\ngain is 30 db. Figure D-3 shows the GILMOR antenna keyhole pattern.\nThe antenna has five operational modes:\nWill automatically track the 136-Mc signal transmitted from the spacecraft\nCan be operated manually\nCan be driven by an antenna programmer\nCan be slaved to an acquisition antenna which may be added later\n\nCan be operated in various search modes for initial acquisition\n\nD- 2\n\n30"\n\n200\n\nFigure\n\n10"\n\nNORTH\n0"\n\nD-3 - GILMOR\n\n350"\n\n340"\n\n10\n"\n\n20"\n\nAntenna Keyhole Pattern\n\nD-3\n\n330"\n30"\n\nThe antenna reflector is mounted on an X-Y mount designed specifically for tracking\nspacecraft, with the advantage that there are no gimbal-lock positions in the sky area\nabove the horizon. This permits optimum tracking of spacecraft without requiring excessive shaft velocities from the antenna-drive system.\nAntenna feeds will have a monopulse autotrack capability on 136 Mc and 1700 Mc. The\nmultifrequency antenna-feed cluster consists of two separate systems; a set of four\ncrossed dipoles for the 136-Mc to 137-Mc band, and a set of four crossed dipoles for\nthe 1700-Mc band. Standard monopulse circuitry with coaxial hybrids obtains the sumchannel and tracking-channel outputs from the a r r a y of four dipoles.\nThe feed system permits the antenna control operator to switch-select any of four polarization senses for reception of 136-Mc signals (two linear and two orthogonal circular).\nAntenna polarization will be righthand circular. The best circular should be selected for\ntracking, but only when data is not being transmitted.\n1.2 R F SECTION\nR F equipment includes receiving, combining, and demodulating equipment for beacon,\nAVCg and APT signals, and command transmitting equipment.\n\nI\n\n,\n\nDuring the prelaunch phase, T&DS will conduct engineering tests of the TOS ground station\nequipment. These tests will be the basis for the prepass t e s t s that will be run at the stations during postlaunch operations. The purpose of these tests is to provide prelaunch\nassurance that all TOS and DAF subsystems a r e compatible and that the integration between subsystems has been completed.\nThe tests will consist of R F loop tests where calibration signal generators a r e modulated\nwith information from either satellite simulators o r magnetic tapes. Input signal levels\nto the R F preamplifiers will be varied in order to obtain dynamic range and threshhold\ndata, The demodulated data will be recorded and played over the microwave links to\nGSFC where appropriate.\nThe R F equipment includes low-noise preamplifiers and down convertors. All tracking\nand data signals a r e translated down to the 130 to 140 Mc band. General Dynamics/\nElectronics Diversity, (GD/E) telemetry receivers a r e used for all data reception. A\npost-detection diversity combiner provides a combining action for either the two linear\no r two orthogonal circular polarization. The diversity receiver has selectable IF bandwidths of 10, 30, 100, 500, 1000, and 3000 kc. The 500 kc bandwidth has replaced the\nstandard 3 0 0 kc bandwidth. An Electrac phase demodulator provides coherent place demodulation for the beacon telemetry signal. A predetection diversity combiner provides\npolarization diversity. Table D-1 lists the setup procedure for the Electrac phase demodulation.\nThe setup procedures for beacon telemetry a r e as follows:\n1. Use standard station procedure to check meter calibration for phase modulation.\n\n2. Set the modulation sensitivity control on the CSG-1 for a peak deviation of 23\ndegrees using only one subcarrier. Remove this subcarrier.\n3. Set the modulation for a peak deviation of 23 degrees by varying the level of the\nsecond subcarrier. Remove this subcarrier.\n\n4.

The signal generator R F output will be fed through the test injection system\ninto the receiving system.

The output of the diversity combiner is a frequency-modulated\nsubcarrier which is deviated between 72 kc and 120 kc at a rate up to 60 kc, and a 9.6-kc\nsubcarrier containing the flutter and wow information. The two bandpass filters separate\nthe video signal from the flutter and wow frequency, and the video subcarrier frequency\nis then doubled without affecting the video baseband (60 kc). The video can be processed\nat the CDA stations to provide back-up to NESC for engineering analysis and to permit\nequipment checks and alignment. The station equipment includes a Polaroid camera to\nprovide the capability of reading out selected frames.\n\nFrequency\nSelectro\nSwitch\nBandwidth\nSwitch\nMode\nSelector\n\nBeacon Telemetry\n136.77 Mc\n\nAVCS- TV\n135 Mc\n\n30 kc\n\n500 kc\n\n---\n\nFM\n\nAnalog Tuning\nSelector Switch\n\nSTD\n\nSTD\n\nGain Control\nMode\n\nAGC\n\nAGC\n\nAGC Speed\n\n300 m sec\n\n300 m sec\n\nSignal\nCalibrator\n\nOFF\n\nOFF\n\nBFO function\n\nOFF\n\nOFF\n\nD-6\n\nTable D-3\nMOD I Telemetry Receiver, Lima\n\n136.77 Mc\n\n=Q.\n\n30 kc\n\nI BW\nF\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIF MODE\nSwitch\n\n10 CPS\n\nFunction\nSwitch\nBFO\n\nOFF\n\nThe AVCS camera and its associated electronics provide a baseband signal which has a\nbandwidth of approximately 0 to 60 kc. This signal frequency-modulates a 96-kc subc a r r i e r (peak deviation of 24 kc) (Figure D-5). The spacecraft transmitted signal consists of a 96-kc subcarrier along with a 9.6 kc flutter-and-wow correction tone that, in\nturn, frequency-modulates the 235 Mc T V transmitter.\nTo simulate this condition, a magnetic tape and a video simulator have been provided\nwhich contains a composite signal consisting of both the modulated 96-kc subcarrier and\nthe flutter-and-wow correction tone.\nThe video information recorded on the magnetic tape will be used to modulate a Booton\n202-5 FM signal generator. The R F output of the signal generator is fed through the 235\nMc test injection network into the receiver system. The FM demodulated output of the\nGD/E receiver is recorded and then played down the microwave link to GSFC at 1/8\nspeed followed by a direct transmission from the Video Simulator.\n\nt\n202-J\n\nSIGNAL\nGENE RATOR\n\n235-Mc\n+ PRE-AMP\nDOWN-CONV\n\n- .\n-)\n\nGDIE\nDIVERSITY\nRCVR\nCHAN A\n\nFM\nVIDEO\nOUT\nDIV\nCOME.\n\n235-Mc\n\n+\n\na\n\nPRE-AMP\nDOWN-CONV\n\nFigure D-5\n\nGD/E\nDIVERSITY\nRCVR\nCHANB\n\n- AVCS Block Diagram\nD-7\n\nFM\nVIDEO*\nOUT\n\nThere a r e four TOS/AVCS video simulators, one for each CDA station, another at NESC\nand the fourth unit at RCA for spacecraft testing. The TOS/AVCS video simulator is a\nprecision piece of test equipment and has been designed and will be operated as a device\nfor testing the video handling portion of the TOS ground stations including the long lines.\nThe signals generated will correspond to those normally present at the inputs to and the\noutputs from the video processor and flutter and wow processor; the output of the video\ndemodulator; and the outputs of the Grand tape recorder when replayed at speeds correand 30 inches/second. A separate channel will provide a signal to simusponding to 7\nlate the inputs to the spacecraft transmitter.\nThe outputs from the simulator will be in the form of an analog video signal, a frequency\nmodulated video carrier, a flutter and wow modulated c a r r i e r and a combined video and\nflutter and wow channel. It will be possible to inject noise into the signal channels and to\ninsert flutter and wow modulation from an external source.\nThere a r e four selectable test patterns as simulator output.

The digital command\nprogrammer generates the digital codes determined by the tape and by other inputs. The\nf\noutputs o the digital command programmer are a frequency shift keyed (FSK) command\ntone and a spacecraft enable tone, which is suitable for driving the command transmitter.\nThe transmitted commands and the verification data (decoded commands retransmitted by\nthe spacecraft on a beacon channel) are compared automatically. Performance of the\ncommand section is checked and verified by a spacecraft-type receiver-decoder combination, which receives the R F signal from the command antenna and provides decoded commands to the comparator. Successful comparison with the output of the digital command\nprogrammer ensures proper ground station operation.\n\nCommands are received at the CDA station by means of a teletypewriter which provides\na punched tape (each station can also make a command tape with its own teletype equipment). The tape uses a 5-level code; the complete command-sequence tape is inserted\nf\nin the tape reader. The tape reader begins t o advance the tape and reads upon receipt o\na pulse from the alarm timer. Upon reading a command, the tape reader causes the digital\ncommand programmer to generate a sync pulse, an address, and the command. After an\ninterval determined by internal electronics, the entire message is transmitted, and the\ntape advances to read the next command.\n\n1\n\nl\n\nThe command systems tests are used to check the interfaces between the TOS CDA station and the command transmitter in the DAF ground station. A test of command transmitter interference on the beacon telemetry will also be made. Arrangements will be\nD-9\n\nI\n\nmade to radiate into space while the telemetry signals a r e being simulated in a system\nloop test. Figure D-6 is a block diagram of the command transmitter interference test.\nThe command transmitter test is conducted as follows:\nSet up the beacon telemetry system as in part 1 through 7 of the Setup\nProcedure, Beacon Telemetry\nModulate the command transmitter.

WALLOPS STATION, VA. (WALOMS)\nThe WALOMS antenna w a s bought by ESSA and is being erected by GSFC T&DS. T&DS\nh a s contracted for design and installation of the entire facility, including site development\nand construction, additional instrumentation, test equipment, spares, and engineering\nservices, using ESSA funds, T&DS will supervise training of ESSA maintenance and operating (M&O) personnel; ESSA will operate the station.\n\nTarget date for beginning WALOMS system checkout is March 1, 1966. Existing antenna\nfacilities at Wallops Station may be used for interim operations. ESSA-supplied M&O\npersonnel, backed up by on-site GSFC and other personnel, will operate the station after\nANTENNA\n\nI\n\nI\nFigure D-6\n\nVERIFICATION LINE\n\n- Command Transmitter\n\nI\n\nInterference Test, Block Diagram\n\nD-10\n\na\n\nMarch 1, 1966. Four weeks of final acceptance testing will begin that same date on a\nnoninterference basis with critical TOS orbits. GSFC contractor will assist in training\nof ESSA staffas agreed by separate negotiations. NASA will supply to ESSA all plans, a\nreproducible copy and one additional copy of "as-built" drawings, system and equipment\nmanuals, wiring diagrams, and specifications used by NASA in the design and construction of the facility.\nA detailed description of WALOMS is given in the GSFC Data System Development P a\nln\n(DSDP), titled TOS US Antenna CDA Station, dated December 30, 1964. WALOMS in..\ncludes:\nA solid-surfacehydraulically driven 85-foot-diameter parabolic antenna with an\nX-Y gimbaling mechanism, having an overall height of approximately 120 feet, a\nfocal length of 36 feet, and weighing approximately 350 tons\n\nElectronic equipment, consisting of receiving systems for both tracking and data\nacquisition, antenna data systems, servo-hydraulic drive and control system, collimation system including optical system, and TOS unique equipment interface\nterminals\nCommunications equipments and facilities, including data-transmission systems\nAn emergency power plant\n\nA single-story operations building with basement, having a ground-level floor area\nof approximately 4500 square feet; a single-story building with an area of approximately 2000 square feet to house the emergency power plant equipments and miscellaneous utilities.\nDriveway, aprons, parking area, sanitary facilities, etc.\nFigure D-7 indicates the extent of the keyhole for a standard pedestal orientation\nin which the X (lower) axis is aligned north-south. A spacecraft in the direction of N\n0"E at an angle above the horizon of less than 12.3 degrees cannot be acquired\nalong the centerline o the major lobe of the antenna. In the direction of N 90"E, a\nf\nspacecraft must be at least 3 degrees above the horizon to allow signal acquisition.\nThe minimum look-angle above the horizontal plane at other azimuth angles can also\nbe determined. Based on the site location at Wallops and the critical TOS orbits, an\noptimum orientation of the X axis has been determined to be N O"E, and the antenna\nwill be installed with that alignment.\n\nThe antenna is capable of tracking at rates up to 3 degrees per second, with an acceleration not exceeding 5 degrees per second squared. The design of the antenna provides for\nbraking and for five operational modes:\nAutomatic trackona spacecraft signal; the severity of the multipath transmission\neffects which will be present during the critical orbits of TOS is expected to preclude\nthe use of this operational mode when the spacecraft is less than approximately 1 0\ndegrees above the horizontal plane\nProgram track, using teletype drive-tape input derived from orbital predictions\nfurnished the station via TOC\nManual position and manual velocity modes, in which the rate and motion of the antenna are controlled by the ball-tracker device.\n\nD-11\n\nNORTH\n\nSOUTH\nFigure\n\nD-7 - WALOMS Antenna Keyhole\nD-12\n\nPattern\n\nSlaved drive, in conjunction with an acquisition aid system which supplies synchro\ninformation generated by the acquisition aid antenna equipments\nSearch mode, which can be superimposed over all modes of operation except the\nmanual velocity mode\nIn the programming function a perforated tape containing precomputed orbital information\ntransmitted from TOC is applied to a tape reader. Antenna position and timing commands\nread from the tape are used t o generate, by interpolation, 1-second drive points, which are\nconverted into analog voltages used to drive the antenna along the predicted orbital path.\n\nThe TOS unique equipment is identical to that for GILMOR.\n\nD-13\n\nAppendix E\nAPT STATIONS\nThe APT ground stations acquire cloud picture data from TOS A F T satellites and reproduce them as photographic images on facsimile recorders o r other suitable devices.\nA P T ground stations have been installed at ESSA, Navy, Army, and Air Force installations as well as at many international locations and at some private agencies.\n\nI\n\n--\n\nTOC will be responsible for producing and distributing APT daily alert and ephemeris\nprediction messages, which will include the minimum predictive data required by the\nground stations to determine the antenna tracking angles to acquire the data from the\nspacecraft and to geographically orient the acquired pictures. The daily messages w l\nil\nbe distributed over national and international meteorological teletypewriter circuits.\nThe format of the daily message and the description of its use is contained in the APT\nUser\'s Guide.\nDetailed instructions on determining the antenna look angle for acquiring data from the\nspacecraft as well as procedures for geographic orientation of the pictures are also\ncontained in the APT U s e r \' s Guide.\nOperational evaluation of the APT system by selected A P T ground stations wiH be requested during the checkout of the system by TEC and later during the lifetime of the\nsatellite as deemed necessary by TOC. These later requests will be initiated by TOC\nthrough the national and international meteorological teletypewriter networks. The APT\nPass Summary and Evaluation Report (Table IV-8) will be completed as requested by\nTOS whenever the A P T TOS satellite is programmed for pictures in range of the APT\nstation.\nThe APT U s e r \' s Guide will be distributed to World Meteorological Organization members\nand will be available from the Government Printing Office, Washington 20025, D. C.\n\nE- 1\n\nAppendix F\nTOS EQUIPMENT\n\nTOC has the capability of receiving and tape recording data from both ground stations\ns i n i l l t a r e c i l y , however the display of data, on Brush recorders can only be performed\none station a a time.

The AVCS\nvideo signal will be processed and displayed in the kinescope rack complex. Polaroid\npictures will enable an analysis of picture quality, timing, interference, etc., by TEC\npersonnel. The APT video signal can be obtained by the CDA stations and transmitted to\nTEC in the same m e r , however, normal test procedures at TEC will be to use the\ninstalled A P T ground station to obtain pictures for analysis.\nThe beacon information will also be processed by an analog to digital converter and the\ndigital signals recorded on magnetic tape. This digital tape is then fed directly into a\ncomputer for a complete tabulation of telemetry information, attitude determination and\npredictions, and other spacecraft criteria which are used by TEC in their evaluation of\nTOS spacecraft.\nAdditional TEC equipment includes:\n0\n\nData processing equipment\nTelemetry calibrator\nBalanced line amplifiers\nDiscriminators\nScanner receivers\nSwitching unit\n\n0\n\nTest equipment.
