The switch is a novel circuit placed in\nthe signal path of a closed-loop receiver to modulate\ntelemetered data in the 10-MHz spectrum. This novel\nsystem. includes meansfordemodulation:of the telemL\netered signals when the phase switch is driven by\na video signal, the spectrum of which corresponds to\nthat of the original modulating signal. This causes\nthe output of the signal-phase switch to be an unmod-\n\nS.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nL_CR11\n\n(\n\naance\nRing\nModul\n\n5th\n\n\'\\CR7\n\n-\t\nQ9\n2k\n7502\t Symmetry 511\nAdjust\n1200pF\n\t\n\nQ4\n\n1.5k g\n\n-iCRB\n\n)CR6\n\n560\n\nCR3\n180l\nCR2-\n\n-l5Vdc 1w\t\n\n_L\t\nQ8\n\n51\t\nQ6\n\nVideo\nInput\n5th\n1/2w\xe2\x80\x94\n\n2k\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

This carrier signal can\nnow be narrow-banded and thus remove the added\nnoise caused by the i.f. "image." The switch operates\nwith considerable stability and linearity over power\nlevels up. to 3 dbm, with minimum carrier suppression\nof 50 db below unmodulated carriers.\nOriginally developed for telemetry from space, the\nsystem is applicable to terrestrial radio-communication systems in which phase-locking techniques are\n(continued overleaf)\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\n. information contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately ownedrights.\n\nrequired for demodulation of telemetered or other\ndata signals with great fidelity; it can be applied to any\nscheme having binary modulation, to measure correlation of modulation with local code. The switch\ncan be used in a commercial receiver to reduce the\neffect of image-noise folding.\nWith the binary-modulator scheme just described,\nthe signal-phase switch can be used in military receivers to reduce the effect of image-noise folding.\nBecause thus far the equipment has been developed for\ndigital modulation, secure military communications,\nusing pseudorandom codes, seem to provide an excellent application for signal-phase switches.\nThus the signal-phase switch has two advantages:\n(1) it enables reduction of subsequent bandwidth and\nso improves the SN ratio by 3 db by rejection of image\nnoise; and (2) by this reduction of bandwidth the\nnoise overload on the following stages is reduced, so\nthat the system has a greater dynamic range.\n\nBrief 70-10393\t\n\nNote:\nThe following documentation is available from:\nClearinghouse for Federal Scientific\nand Technical Information\nSpringfield, Virginia 22151\nSingle document price $3.00\n(or microfiche $0.65)\nReference: NASA-CR-90 199 (N68-11006),\nDevelopment of 10-MHz Phase Switches\n\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: R.B.
