The general focus of all studies was on a phase 11 lunar base, or a lunar\nbase during the period after the first return of a crew to the Moon, but before permanent occupancy. The software effort produced a series of trajectory programs covering low Earth orbit\n(LEO) to various node locations, the node locations to the lunar surface and then back to LEO.\nThe surface operations study took a lunar scenario defined in the Civil Needs Data Base (CNDB)\nand attempted to estimate the amount of space-suit work or extra-vehicular activity (EVA)\nrequired on the lunar surface to set up the base. More EVA and crew time was predicted to be\nneeded to set up this base than was easily available. The proposed solution was teleoperation\nfrom the lunar surface and from Earth.\nThe maintenance and supply options study was a first look at the problems of supplying and\nmaintaining a lunar base. Maintenance and supportability must take a higher profde in a lunar\nbase than in any previous program. Spares and consumables are small numbers for short\ninissions (less than 30 days) but dedicated logistics landings may be required for 180 day stays.\nA conceptual design for a multi-purpose, single stage lunar lander was produced. The lander\nwas to be returned to LEO for refurbishing and propellant loading after each mission. Numerous\ntrades were examined and Apollo data was collected.\nA lunar surface launch and landing facility was conceptually designed, consisting of transponder\nnavigation devices and lighting, surface power and thermal control carts, and a pressurized\ningresdegress concept. Ejecta from engine blast was found to be a serious problem requirhg the\nlanding area to be some kilometers from the base.\nAfter careful comparison of thirteen different processes, two processes were chosen as candidates for a lunar oxygen pilot plant and plants were conceptually designed, The ilmenite\nreduction process plant had a landed mass of 25 m tons and required 146 kwe of solar power.\nThe thermal recovery of oxygen and solar wind hydrogen process required 60 m tons landed\nmass and a 1.7 MWe nuclear source.\nThe lunar storm shelter study examined the problems of radiation protection on the lunar surface.\nDose limits were proposed for various missions and a range of shelter concepts weighed and\nsized.\nThe LEO Transportation Node Assumptions and Requirements study attempted to document the\nassumptions and requirements needed to define a LEO space station supporting a lunar transportation system consisting of orbital transfer vehicles ( O m s ) and landers. Requirements were\nderived based on the assumed activities needed.\nA LEO transportation node space station was then conceptually designed to maintain and\nrefurbish two lunar.lander/OTV stacks. The station was designed to support eight flights to the\nMoon per year. The station\xe2\x80\x99s maximum loaded weight (with two stacks) is around 1,000 metric\ntons. The dry weight is around 400 m tons.\n\n1\n\nThree concepts for lunar surface transportation were examined. An unpressurized rover with a\n50 km range weighed 550 kgm empty and required 2.15 h e of power. A pressurized rover, fuel\ncell powered, in a train configuration weighed 18 m tons and used 25 kwe peak power to travel\n3,000 km in 42 days. A hopper, based on the surface and using the prcviously designed lander,\ncould travel only 1,OOO km from the base. For this reason, descent from orbit was recommended\nfor ranges over 1,500 km.\nThe Lunar Surface Construction and Equipment Assembly study defined twenty surface\nconstruction and assembly tasks in detail. Terrestrial equipment was then surveyed and a variety\nof different concepts for performing the tasks were identified and compared.\nCost estimates for the develapmnt and production of a number of the previously discussed lunar\nprogram elements were produced wing a widely accepted costing program.\n\nThree applications of superconductivity to a lunar surface base wen examined; electrical energy\nstorage, electromagnetic launchers, and magnetic radiation shields.\nThe initial product of the lunar software effort was a short book with weights of all previous\nspacecraft and subsystems of interest to aid in spacecraft and subsystem mass estimation.\nSeven programs wen produced to estimate delta Vs and trans-lunar trajectories:\nThe first program (LLOFX) calculates in-plane trajectories from a LEO space station to low\nlunar orbit (LLO) using only two burns. LEO orbit altitude, lunar orbit altitude, and flight time\nare the inputs to t i patched conic style program. The two delta Vs are the output.\nhs\nThe second program (PLANECHG) also calculates LEO to LLO and back trajectories using\npatched conic methods. It uses three bums however and allows the choice of any altitude,\ninclination, and longitude of the ascending node for LEO and LLO deparhm or arrival orbits.\nCISLUNAR calculates trajectories from LEO to LLO and back for low thrust vehicles using an\nintegrator. The low-thrust vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s characteristicsmust be supplied and guidance schemes must\nbe manually adjusted. All trajectories must be in the plane of the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s orbit.\n\nLANDER calculates ascent and descent trajectories between LLO and the lunar surface using an\nintegrator. Vehicle characteristics must be input.\nLIBRATE calculates delta Vs for trajectories from LEO to four of the five Earth-Moon libration\npoints. The libration point on the farside of the Moon (Ll) is excluded. LIBRATE also runs\ntrajectories from LLO to L1 and L2. L1 and L2 are the libration points on the Earth-Moon line\non the far and near sides of the Moon respectively. Inputs include departure orbit altitude and\ninclination and flight time.\nLP1 calculates trajectories from LEO to and from L1 on the far side of the Moon. Lunar flybys\nare used.\n\nA short report documents delta Vs f o U O to LA and L5 and back as a function of flight time.\nrm\n.\nTransfers from LEO to LLO by way of LA of L5 require on the order of 760 m/scc more total\ndelta V than dircct LEO to LLO transfers.\n2\n\nFigure 1.0-1 shows a base moving into the permanent occupancy (phase I I state. A "lunar\nI)\nshack" or single module is first placed on the surface to serves as a construction habitat. A large\ninflatable habitat is installed later, as well a a lunar oxygen pilot plant, a 100 kw continuous\ns\nsolar power plant, and other systems discussed in later sections. The inflatable is being covered\nwith regolith with a continuous bagging machine. Permanent landing pads are visible in the\ndistance and a small vehicle carrying cryogenic propellants is returning from the landing pad\narea.\n\n3\n\n2.0\n\nLunar Surface Operations Study Summary\n\nThe purpose of this study was to perform an analysis of the surface operations associated with a\nhuman-tended lunar base. Specifically, the study (1) defined surface elements and developed\nmission manifests for a selected base scenario, (2) determined the nature of surface operations\nassociated with this scenario, (3) generated a preliminary crew extravehicular and intravehicular\nactivity (EVA/IVA) time resource schedule for conducting the missions, and (4)proposed\nconcepts for utilizing remotely operated equipment to perform repetitious or hazardous surface\ntasks. The operations analysis was performed on a 6-year period of human-tended lunar base\noperation prior to permanent occupancy. The baseline scenario was derived from a modified\nversion of the civil needs database (CNDB) scenario. The scenario emphasizes achievement of a\nlimited set of science and exploration objectives while emplacing the minimum habitability\nelements required for a permanent base.\nGroundrules defined for the study included: (1) lunar manned and unmanned cargo flight rates\nwere assumed to build from 2 to a maximum of 8 per year in the human-tended base period, (2)\ninitial surface operations used a crew module on top of a lunar lander for habitation and were\ntherefore limited in surface stay times to the life support capability of the lander\xe2\x80\x99s crew module,\npresumed in this case to be 8 days for 4 crew, (3) the operations center shifted to the base and\nstay times were increased to 24 days after the following surface elements become operational:\nsolar flare radiation shelter, habitation module, interface node, airlock, power system, thermal\ncontrol system, and communications relay station.\nLunar base crew shift schedules were formulated f o Shuttle guidelines and Space Station crew\nrm\nplans, and from them, time allocations for operational tasks were determined. For instance, of\nthe 768 person-hours available on 4 crew, 8-day surface stay missions, only approximately 228\nhours were actually available for surface operations after accounting for sleep, meals and\npersonal time, spacecraft housekeeping and systems monitoring, arrival and departure spacecraft\nchecks and preparation activities. Out of this 228 hr. surface operations resource, 6 two person\nEVA\xe2\x80\x99Swere planned to provide 72 hrs. of EVA operations. N A maintenance/refurbishment and\ningress/egress activities required to support these EVA\xe2\x80\x99S consumed 49 hrs., yielding 107 hrs. for\nother IVA activities, such as teleoperation of base site surface preparation and construction\nequipment.\nSpecific surface operations addressed in this report included IVA support activities for EVA,\nlanding/launch site preparation, cargo handling equipment and activities, radiation shelter\nemplacement, exposed (non-buried or covered) module emplacement construction equipment\nand operations, science operations, resource utilization operations, logistics and maintenance\nactivities, manual/telerobotic division of labor, and contingency operations. For instance, the\npossible methods to provide 700 g/cm2 of radiation protection (approximately 4 m of regolith\noverburden) for a solar flare shelter were surveyed, and the E V m A time required for the\nbaseline concept utilizing a bulkhead arrangement was determined.\n\nA major conclusion of the study was that 4 person crews on approximately 1 month missions can\naccomplish significant science and resource development objectives while constructing a\npermanent base, but that teleoperation of soil moving and construction equipment from the lunar\nlander, lunar base, and Earth is required to leverage limited EVA time resources. Teleoperation\nis particularly important during short duration early missions for site preparation and solar flare\nshelter emplacement. Figure 2.0-1 illustrates this concept. Technology development in automa5\n\ntion and robotics (A&R) applications to surface construction vehicles is considered essential,\nespecially to allow lunar teleoperations from Earth with the imposed communications delay. It\nwas also concluded, after estimating EVA/IVA time requirements for various surface activities,\nthat providing radiation protection for all modules (by burying or covering with soil) should wait\nuntil the base is permanently occupied, when sufficient time resources axe available. In addition,\na concept for a lunar surface telerobotic servicer was proposed to perform inspection and\nmaintenance activities.\n\n6\n\nFigure 2.0-1, Teleoperation on the Lunar Surface\n\n.\n\n7\n\n, *-\n\n3.0\n\nMaintenance and Supply Options Study Summary\n\nThe purpose of this task was to define the maintenance and supply requirements for a lunar base.\nTrade studies performed concerned the size of the crew, the impact of lunar stay time intervals,\nand the options for packaging and shipping of spares and consumables. Design requirements for\na logistics supply module were also produced. To accomplish the above, the CNDB Lunar Base\nScenario (Ref. 1) was reviewed and a modified version used as a baseline. High level maintenance and supply functions were defined. Some of the design and operational approaches\ndeveloped for the Space Station were either retained where commonality was desired or modified and applied to the Lunar Base.\nThe requirement to design for maintainability must play a much larger role in this program than\nhas been the case in the past. A very complex system must be maintained at a great distance by\na handful of people. This is without precedent in space work.\n\nA phased approach was taken for both maintenance and logistics operations to support the Lunar\nBase. Maintenance and logistics operations were minimized during the early phase of the base\nbuild up and gradually increased as the equipment and crew complement allowed.\nIn the first period of 8 day surface stay times, the mode of operation is similar to that of the\nApollo missions where the crew operated out of the lander and depended on subsystem redundancy instead of planned maintenance. Logistic activities during this period are primarily\nlimited to delivery of items to the lunar surface and temporary storage of spares and consumables. The next period of 24 day surface stay time missions allowed operation from a pressurized habitat module which enabled lunar base crew interaction with onboard systems which\ntracked maintenance and logistic activities and hardware. A minimum level of maintenance\nactivities was envisioned for this period with the availability of limited spares and maintenance\ncapabilities. In the final period of 180 day surface stays and permanent occupancy of the lunar\nbase, scheduled maintenance and routine logistics are incorporated into the daily activities.\nThe crew size trade led to a baseline crew size of 4 which permitted the minimum weight and\nvolume impact to the transportation system but limited the amount of crew time available to\ni\nperform lunar surface operations. Comparisons between crew skill and specialty m x to surface\noperational activities led to a preference for a larger crew size to provide the necessary specialty\nm x and crew hours available to perform the tasks envisioned to suppoxt lunar base buildup and\ni\noperation. A crew size of 6 provided maximum operational flexibility (3 shifts) with a minimum\nof weight penalty.\nInvestigations into extending the crew surface stay times showed that stay times for both short\nand medium duration missions could be increased with a small delta weight impact for consumables. These impacts amounted to 52 kg. (113 lbs.) to extend the surface stay time from 8 days\nto 11 days, and 307 kg. (675 lbs.) to extend the surface stay time from 24 days to 42 days for a\ncrew of 4. In both cases, the impacts are small when bompared to performing an additional\nmission to gain the operational crew time for lunar surface operations. Factors not considered in\nthe stay time extension study were the effeqts of crew fatigue and limitations due to Earth/Moon\norbital mechanics. Optimum launch windows to and from the Moon occur at intervals of\napproximately 9 days for low latitude bases. The issue of surface stay time should be reevaluated after a detailed study of launch windows and abort opportunities i performed.\ns\n8\n\nThe study on packaging and supply options indicated that for the earlier missions of 8 and 24\nday surface stay times, the consumables could be carried with the manned missions. The\nbaseline scenario did not include provisions for spares for equipment delivered to the lunar\nsurface. Spares will make up a large fraction of the maintenance and supply mass delivered to\nthe lunar base. M s estimates indicate that dedicated cargo flights carrying only spares may be\nas\nrequired. For the later manned missions where permanent Lunar Base occupancy in considered,\nlogistic modules should be developed to deliver spares and consumables to the lunar surface. A\nconceptual design for the logistic supply module evolved to three modules, a pressurized supply\nmodule, a tank module, and pallet modules. These concepts are shown in Figure 3.0-1.\nAdditionally, a need for a facility to temporarily store spares and disposed reusable materials\nwas identified.\n\n9\n\nFigure 3.0,\n\nLogistics Modules\n\nLogistics Supply Module\n+3.7m\n\nrModule Length\n\nStt-uctureand\n\n+\n\nSubsystems\n\nPayload\n\n528Kg\n1,165 Ibs\n\n10,838Kg\n23,894 Ibs\n\nHardware Mass\n3,525 Kg\n7 , n l Ibs\n\n5.7 rn\n18.6 ft\n\n12.2 n\n\nTotal Mass\n\nI\n\n32,830 Ibs\n141891Kg\n\nI\n\nFluid Shipping Module\n,\n\nCyrogenic Tanks\n(Typical 4 Places)\nLiquid Tanks\n(Typical 8 Places)\n\n4.42m\n14.5 ft\n\n1\n\nF2.2rn\n\n\'\n\ncf\n\nInterface Connectors\n\ne 4 . 4 2 r n4\n14.5 ft\n\nModule Length Struct.

The initial idea was to build a reusable lander, suitable for minimizing the\ntransportation cost to a permanent base, and use it from the first manned mission on, taking some\npenalty and perhaps expending expensive vehicles early in the program in order to avoid\nbuilding multiple types of landers and focusing the effort on a space maintainable, single-stage,\nreusable vehicle.\n\nA single stage lander is feasible from low lunar orbit. Initial calculations do not show large\nweight penalties (15-3096) over two-stage vehicles. A lander capable of multiple roles, such as\nlanding cargo one way or taking crew modules round trip is possible with some penalty ( 5 to\n10%) over dedicated designs. The size of payload (lander plus cargo) delivered from Earth to\nlunar orbit may vary by as much as a factor of two however, complicating orbital transfer vehicle\n( O W )design.\nA single type of engine usable for several different size landers appears to be possible. Different\nsize landers and radically different payloads may require multiple trips with the O W delivery\nvehicle(s) and storage of the first payload in lunar orbit, or a performance penalty due to\nadditional tankage mass carried for small payload missions.\nA four engine design for a multi-purpose vehicle, with total thrust in the range of 35-40,000 lbf\n(12 to 13,000 lbf per engine) and a throttling ratio in the 13:l to 20:l range is proposed. Initial\nwork indicates a regeneratively cooled, pump-fed engine will be required due to difficulties with\nregenerative cooling over wide throttling ranges with pressure-fed systems. The engine is the\nsingle most important technical development item. Reuse and space maintainability requirements make it near or beyond the current state of the art. Study and simulation work should\ncontinue until this engine is defined well enough such that long lead development can start.\nInitial calculations indicate low lunar orbit offers the lowest low Ea~th\norbit (LEO) stack mass.\nLow altitude lunar orbits are unstable for long periods of time. The instability limit may set the\nparking orbit altitude.\nLEO basing for the lander appears possible, with some penalty in LEO stack mass (10-25%)\nover a scheme that bases the lander in low lunar orbit (LLO) or expends it. The lander will\nrequire a special OTV to aerobrake it into LEO however. Loading all propellants from Earth on\nthe lunar surface does not appear to be practical because of the additional propellant needed to\nland this propellant on the lunar surface. An additional lander mission is needed to land the\npropellant on the lunar surface. This may change when propellant can be produced on the lunar\nsurface.\nThe lander must be designed from the start for ease of maintenance, and simplicity. Design\nfeatures, such as special pressurized volumes will be needed to make the vehicle maintainable in\nspace. Space maintainability and reusability must be made a priority.\nLiquid oxygedliquid hydrogen propellants show the best performance, but hydrogen may be\ndifficult to store for long periods of time in the lander on the surface. Earth storable and space\nstorable propellants are not ruled out. Liquid hydrogen storage over a 180 day period on the\n\n11\n\nlunar surface at the equator needs study. A point design of a liquid oxygen/liq. hydrogen lander\n\nneeds to be done in order to have a good inert mass data point that shows the performance gain is\nreal.\nFigure 4.0-1 shows this lander in lunar orbit, about to dock with a large (single stage) O W . The\nOTV is designed to return the lander to the Space Station for servicing. The O W delivers the\nlander to low lunar orbit, single stage, and waits in orbit for it to return. The O W tanks are\nsized to hold 118 m tons of LOJLH, propellants.\nImportant features of this lander include:\nI)\n\nAirlock/servicing tunnel down center of lander to allow easy access on surface and\npressurized volume for LRUs. Many engine connections can be made and broken inside\nthe pressurized volume.\n\n2)\n\nRemovable crew module. The lander is flyable without the crew module.\n\n3)\n\nLander fits in 30 foot heavy lift vehicle shroud with landing gear stowed.\n\n4)\n\nElectro-mechanical shock absorbers on landing gear.\n\n5)\n\nEmergency ascent with one or two crew possible without crew module.

The emphasis of\nthis study is on the facilities needed from the first manned landing until permanent occupancy.\nSurface characteristics and flight vehicle interactions are described, and various facility operations are related. Specific recommendations for equipment, facilities, and evolutionary planning\nare made, and effects of different aspects of lunar development scenarios on facilities and\noperations are detailed. Finally, for a given scenario, a specific conceptual design is developed\nand presented.\nLaunch and landing facilities and their growth rate depend on the base development scenario.\nThe major emphasis of the base, the rate of emplacement of facilities, and the design of the flight\nvehicle will all play major roles in the requirements for facilities. Resource utilization bases will\nrequire more and different landing facilities than will science or habitation bases. The more\nrapidly some base capabilities are achieved, the more rapidly landing facility capabilities are\nrequired. Vehicles that require extensive surface-based servicing will require leveled permanent\nlanding areas. These permanent reusable landing pads are not needed or desired before major\nresource export of vehicle servicing activities take place. For some lunar base scenarios,\npermanent landing pads may never be needed.\nBased on the calculations done during this study, the effects of engine blast are significant.\nWhile they are not critical or life threatening, they must be considered. Equipment within 50\nmeters of a landing may experience severe damage due to the impact of fairly large grains of\nlunar soil. Equipment over 400 meters away will require only minimal protection. At 1 to 2\nkilometers blast effects are very small. Figure 5.0-1 shows representatives particle trajectories.\nFigure 5.0-2 shows the estimated number of impacts as a function of distance.\nLanding pads can be designed without general regard to the specific landing site because overall\nsurface conditions are fairly uniform across the entire lunar surface. Landing pads, whether\nprepared or not, should be about 100 meters across. The area just outside this circle to 200\nmeters across should not include any major obstructions such as boulders or expended landers.\nLunar derived gravel may be used to stabilize prepared landing pads.\nWith few exceptions, lunar landing facilities and equipment are present on the lunar surface for\nother reasons before they are needed for landing operations. Landing equipment and facilities\nwill probably not be major drivers of delivery schedules and missions plans.\nMore work is needed concerning blast effects, vehicle servicing on the surface, site planning and\ndevelopment, and safety and rescue operations. More design definition is needed for surface\nstabilization methods, cryogen storage and transfer facilities, servicing and maintenance\nequipment, and other items.\nThe launch and landing facilities of a permanently occupied base need to be defined. This study\nwas limited to the initial lunar base, and the facilities needed for extensive permanently occupied\nor Phase III bases have only been reviewed in a cursory fashion.\n\n16\n\nFigure 5.0-1, Lofted Particle Trajectories\n\n60\n\nm\nW\n\n50\n\nd\n\nu\n\n2\n\nY\n\nW\n0\n\nm\n\n40\n\nc\nL\n\na\nm\n\nE\n\n30\n\nE\n\nc\nV\n\nC\n\na\n\n20\n\n4\n\nm\n.-\n\nP\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\nI .2\n\n0.8\n\nI .6\n\n2\n\nDistance from Lander (Kilometers)\n\nFigure 5.0-2, Impacts as a Function of Distance\n\n0\n\n02\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\nDistance from Lander Nozzle (Kilometers)\n\n17\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nFigure 5.0-3 is an illustration of some of the landing facilities as they might appear near the end\nof the Phase I1 Lunar Base. The landing has taken place just after the lunar dawn. Earth appears\nover the Rook Mountains in the east across the bed of the Lake of Spring (Lacus Vexis).\nThroughout the next month it will dip below the horizon, only to appear again after a few days.\nAbove Earth,the Sun moves slowly higher in the lunar sky. The lander sits in the middle of the\n100-meter diameter gravel landing pad where it is being readied for its stay on the lunar surface.\nInside, crewinembers are shutting down the flight systems and configuring the lander for its\nlayover.\nThe pressurized vehicle in the foreground is connected to the lander, waiting to take the crew\nback to the lunar base. The transfer tunnel has been connected between the lander and the\nvehicle to allow the crew easy access in and out.\nBeneath the lander an astronaut begins the process of changing an engine by removing and\nrelocating an old engine with a mounting rig. Changing modular line replaceable units is the\nfirst form of flight vehicle servicing to take place at the lunar base.\nTo the right of the lander, a Propellant Refill Vehicle is being used to scavenge hydrogen\nremaining in the tanks. This might be done as quickly as possible before the Sun heats the tanks\nand boils away the fuel. Still further, a supplemental cooling cart has been connected to the\nlander\xe2\x80\x99s thermal control system. The radiator on this cart will help keep the lander and its\nsystems cool during the lunar day.\nA crane removes a small canister containing the personal items of the arriving crew along with\nsome small experiments and supplies.\nTo provide electrical power to the lander while it is on the pad, a power cart has been moved\nbetween the lander legs on the left. Using the fuel cells and the solar panel on top, the power\ncart will support the lander for the next month.\nDraped around the back legs of the lander, a thermal and meteoroid blanket is ready to be lifted\nover the lander. When all other preparations have been finished the blanket will be pulled over\nthe lander to protect it from the bombardment of micrometeoroids. It will shield the lander from\nthe Sun during the lunar day and help keep it warm during the night.\nAt the edge of the pad, an astronaut inspects one of the three landing pad markers for damage.\nEjecta from repeated landings may have damaged the reflector, the light, or the radar transponder mounted on the marker. The transponders are vital in guiding the lander to an accurate\nlanding. The reflector appears translucent in the intense sunlight. The mesh surface decreases\nthe pressure effects of the engine exhaust as the lander passes over.\nThe landing pad is surfaced with packed gravel which is a bi-product of the mining operations\ntaking place on the lunar surface. Roads and other smooth level surfaces can also be surfaced\nwith this gravel.\n\n18\n\nFigure 5.0-3, Lunar Lander on Surface\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\n\nORIGlNAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\n19\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n6.0\n\nLunar Oxygen Pilot Plant Conceptual Design Summary\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to develop conceptual designs of two pilot plants to\nproduce oxygen from lunar materials. A lunar pilot plant will be used to generate engineering\ndata necessary to support an optimum design of a large scale production plant. Lunar oxygen\nwould be of primary value as spacecraft propellant oxidizer. In addition, lunar oxygen would be\nuseful for servicing non-regenerative fuel cell power systems, providing requirements for life\nsupport, and to makeup oxygen losses from leakage and airlock cycling.\nNumerous processes to produce oxygen from lunar materials have been proposed. Thirteen\ndifferent lunar oxygen production methods are described in this report. Comparisons are\ncomplicated because many variations of each process exist, and some produce multiple byproducts with potential uses at a later stage of lunar base development. Based on process simplicity\nand well understood reaction chemistry, hydrogen reduction of ilmenite was selected for\nconceptual design studies. Based on recovery of an important "byproduct", a second process\npathway to oxygen, extraction of solar-wind hydrogen from bulk lunar soil, was also selected for\nconceptual design. Thermal recovery of solar-wind hydrogen liberates water, which is subsequently electrolyzed to produce oxygen (water is a reaction product of hydrogen and ilmenite\ncontained in the soil), as well as hydrogen. Thus, hydrogen recovery offers a process that\nproduces both oxidizer and fuel propellants for lunar landers and other spacecraft.\nComputer models of both processes were prepared that utilize equipment scaling relations, m s\nas\nand energy balances, and thermodynamic relationships to estimate mass and power requirements\nfor oxygen production plants. Trades and sensitivity analyses were performed with these\nmodels. Studies on the hydrogen reduction of ilmenite process included:\n.\nI\n.\nI\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nEvaluation of feedstock alternatives: high-titanium mare soil or basalt\nEffect of solar and nuclear-electric power sources.\nEffect on pilot plant mass/power to simply vent the product oxygen gas instead of\nliquefying and storing it (since the pilot plant is a research tool).\nComparison between delivering a series of small self-contained, modular production\nplants to increase oxygen production versus constructing a single, large plant.\nDifference between using unbeneficiated feedstock or using magnetic or electrostatic\nseparation to feed an ilmenite concentrate to the reactor.\nSensitivity of process mass and power to oxygen production rate.\nSensitivity of process mass and power to feedstock conditions such as ilmenite abundance in soil or ilmenite grain size in basalt.\n\nFigure 6.0-1 shows a 2 metric ton/month LOX pilot plant conceptual design, employing hydrogen reduction of ilmenite. Figure 6.0-2 defines the pieces in Figure 6.0-1. Plant mass is 24.7\nmetric tons (54,400 lb,) including a power system that uses solar photovoltaic arrays to provide\n146 kwe for the process and for regenerating fuel cell reactants. Baseline plant operating\nstrategy is mining and continuous processing during the lunar day, and no mining with processing units on hot standby during the lunar night. Figure 6.0-3 shows a schematic of the process.\nThe major process equipment is delivered to the lunar surface in an integrated package that\nmanifests easily into a Shuttle payload pallet with outside dimensions of 14\' diameter x 45\' long.\nHowever, additional volume is required to deliver the power systems. Since it is assumed that\nthe purpose of the pilot plant is to provide long-term, 1/6-g equipment performance data, the\nplant will be operated for continuous periods without on-site human attention. Thus, extensive\n\n20\n\nautomation and robotics applications are anticipated for the pilot plant, such as teleoperated\nmining vehicles and equipment servicers. These would have numerous applications in other\nareas of lunar base operations.\nStudies of the optimum temperature for solar-wind hydrogen extraction and the sensitivity of\nplant mass/power to production rates were also completed. Mass of a pilot plant designed to\nproduce 2 metric ton/month LOX and 1.2 metric ton/month LH, is 60 metric tons (132,200 IbJ.\nThe mass estimate includes a nuclear power plant providing 1.7 MWe for the process\n\n21\n\nI\n\'D\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nFigure 6.0-1, Ilmenite Reduction Process Lunar Oxygen Pilot Plant\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n22\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\n~\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n~_____\n\n~\n\n~~~~\n\n~\n\nFigure 6.0-2, Explanation of Oxygen Pilot Plant\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n1\nI\nI\n\n23\n\nO R W A L PAGE IS\n\nOF POOR OUALITY\nFigure 6.0-3, Schematic of Proposed Ilmenite Reduction Process\n\nI\n\n;i\n\n24\n\n7.0\n\nLunar Storm Shelter Conceptual Design Summary\n\nExtended occupancy on the lunar surface will require redefinition of the allowed radiation\nexposure of crewmen performing lunar missions, It is proposed that the radiation dose be\ndivided into three parts as follows:\n1)\n\nExtra-Vehicular Activitv (EVA) ExDosure during auiescent solar periods (no solar flare\nactivity) While performing EVA type operations and while in transit to and from the\nlunar surface, or other unprotected conditions. A period of continuous low level of\nknown radiation exposure will occur. It is proposed that the dose limit for these exposure\nbe set at 5 REM.\n\n2)\n\nEmergency exposure While on an extended EVA mission, or during other unprotected\nconditions, in the event a solar flare occurs and the crewman cannot return to the main\nsolar base where more complete radiation protection is provided, a short period of high\nlevel exposure will occur. For this emergency exposure a dose limit of 20 REM is\nproposed, delivered in a period of 24 hours or less.\n\n3)\n\nExDosure within the Dermanent lunar shelter While within a well shielded habitat,\nradiation exposure corresponds to the natural radiation background on Earth. It is\nproposed that this limit level be set at 0 REM.\n\nUnder the worst possible conditions the total dose received by any crewman is limited to the sum\nof the quiescent and emergency doses or 25 REM. To accomplish this level of dose control,\nquiescent EVA exposure must be limited to 5 REM by measurement and control of individual\nexposures. Sufficient shielding must be provided for the case where a solar flare is encountered\nwhile on an EVA operation to limit the dose in that period to 20 REM, and the main lunar shelter\nmust be shielded to a level that produces an Earth equivalent background radiation level during\nall periods that a crewman is not performing an EVA operation. Note that the main shelter is not\nmerely a storm shelter, but that it also eliminates the quiescent radiation dose in order to\nmaximize the allowable dose received during EVA operations.\nIn this paper no attempt is made to correlate with any specific lunar program or mission. Instead,\n\nsome of the options that should cover the range of possible missions are considered. The lunar\nmissions could have durations of a week, a month, or six months and periods of occupancy up to\nyears. Solar flare protection is the primary consideration for the shorter missions up to a month.\ns\nFor the longer missions, the requirement to reduce the constant galactic cosmic ray dose i the\nprimary radiation protection consideration resulting in a heavily shielded habitat. The unshielded galactic cosmic ray dose is on the order of 20 to 50 REM/year. Exploration of the lunar\nsurface, and the establishment of remote scientific stations adds additional complications to the\nradiation problem. Several options to cover the range of missions have evolved as follows:\nBuried Lunar Base This base provides a radiation environment equivalent to the background\nradiation encountered on Earth, and is required for missions of six months or more. A four man\nbase is estimated to require 4,000 cu.ft. interior volume. The resupply time is taken as 180 days.\nThe minimum shielding requirement is 785 grams/cm2, which provides a dose from galactic\ncosmic rays similar to that on Earth for people living at an altitude of 9000 ft. above sea level.\nThe thickness of the shielding requires that the density of the lunar material as placed upon the\nshelter be known. Because of tamping problems on the lunar surface the density might be as low\n25\n\nas 1 gdcm\'. This density would require a shield thickness of 7.85 meters. If the upper estimated density of lunar material, 3 gm/cm\' is used, the shield thickness is 2.62 meters. Actual\nthickness will be determined by on site measurements, while burying is underway. The construction of a buried shelter assumes that construction equipment is on the lunar surface, and\nshould require a number of flights to implement. Thus it is not a candidate for early lunar\nmissions.\n\nEarth Fabricated Solar Flare Storm Shelter This type of shelter is considered applicable for\nmissions of up to about 30 days duration. It is considered capable of supporting four men for a\nperiod of up to 10 days, while a solar flare is in progress. Because the total exposure time to\nGalactic Cosmic Rays is for not more than 30 days, the total dose from these rays will be less\nthan 5 REM under the most pessimistic assumptions. The storm shelter needs only to protect\nagainst a worst case solar flare by reducing the dose to 20 REM. Such a shelter would require a\nshield thickness of 59 gm/cm2of aluminum or a wall of thickness of 8.70" (22 cm). The mass of\nsuch a shelter is estimated at 14.7 tons. No provision in this estimate has been made other than\ninterface connections for power, air, communications and control. A small, self-contained waste\ndisposal device is needed. The capability to deliver this shelter to the Moon and to offload, level\nand connect to the life support, power, and other systems was not addressed.\nAn alternate to the thick walled, 4 man storm shelter would be to deliver a thin walled shelter\n\nand a small earth moving device. Assuming that the average wall thickness is 3/16", the weight\nof the storm cellar module delivered from Earth should be -500-600 lbs (225-275 kg) including\n\nonly the aluminum shell. For solar flare protection only, covering with lunar soil could be\naccomplished with a small teleoperated earth mover. Assuming loosely packed lunar soil with a\ndensity of 1 gm/cm\' , a soil cover of about 2 feet (61 cm) would be required. This would require\nmoving 815 to 850 ft3of soil depending on burial depth.\nShould neither of the above solutions prove feasible, then the mission should be planned for\nperiods of low solar activity. The available solar flare data indicate that no major and very few\nsmall flares (which would not impact dose limits) are encountered when the sunspot number i\ns\nless than about 35. The sunspot activity is below this level for about 4 years as one cycle ends\nand the next cycle begins.\nLightly Shielded Vehicles on the Lunar Surface These vehicles consist of a pressurized flyer or\nlunar rover, which are operated under shirt sleeve conditions. In the event of a solar flare, the\ntime needed to return to either of the previously discussed shelters may equal the time to deliver\nin excess of 90% of the total dose from a solar flare (i.e. 6 to 8 hours). These vehicles are\nassumed to carry a crew of one or two. The mass of shielding to produce a dose of not more\nthan 20 REM for a two man arrangement is -6 tons of aluminum. The mass is noted as a guide\nfor vehicle design. Since incorporating this amount of mass may not be feasible an inflatable\nstructure which can be buried by a backhoe blade on the surface vehicle should be investigated.\nThe required burial depth is on the order of 2 feet as discussed above.\nPartial Protection Garment For operations performed in the spacesuit and also in an unpressurized lunar rover, the return time to a safe shelter is estimated not to exceed 3 hours. Vital\nrepairs may require exposure to high radiation fields. For these conditions a concept for a partial\nprotection garment is described. This garment weighs 375 Ibs. (170 kgms). On the lunar surface\nit is equivalent to carrying 63 lbs (29 kgms) on Earth. It is capable of reducing the radiation\nlevel from 5 to 7 times. A trade study is needed between mobility and weight, and detailed work\n\n26\n\nmay eliminate unneeded shielding around the back pack area. Figure 7.0-1 illustrates the partial\nprotection garment.\n\n27\n\nI\nI\n1\n1\n\nFigure 7.0-1, Partial Protection Garment\n\nBack Lighter Than Front\nBack Pack Shielding Taken In Account\n\nI\n1\n1\n1\n1\nI\nI\nI\n1\n1\ni\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n28\n\n8.0\n\nSpace Transportation Nodes Assumptions and Requirements\n\nThis study was an effort to document upper level Space Transportation Node (STN)assumptions\nand requirements. The STN is an LEO space station supporting the transportation system for an\nearly lunar base.\nAssumptions are one category of design guidance provided to an engineering design team. They\nare those guidelines that are conceived through supposition and legislated by policy because\ninsufficient information or time is available for explicit verification. Requirements are the other\ndesign guidance category. They are derived by analysis of the functional task of interest or\nknown by prior experience. The assumptions and requirements of interest to this task are the\nupper level specifications which bound the architectural concepts and state the functional\nperformance demands on the systems. While numerous conceptual configurations for space\ntransportation nodes can be found in the literature, the intent of this task was to develop and\ndocument STN assumptions and requirements without any preconceived model of a design\nconfiguration. A later, related study (see section 9.0) was tasked to develop an STN design\nconcept which satisfied the upper level assumptions and requirements of this study task.\nThe task activities were planned to produce results which were relatable to space station\ndevelopment, responsive to the synthesized models for the initial years of the lunar base, and\norganized to accommodate continued development.\nIn the Space Station Program, the requirements documentation tree begins with JSC 30000, JSC\n3 1000 and the Architectural Control Documents (ACD\'s). Therefore, the STN requirements\ndocumentation is patterned after the JSC 3 1000, Space Station Projects Requirements Document.\nDocuments with detail such as the Space Station Interface Control Documents and Contract End\nItem Specifications are not appropriate at this phase of program planning.\nThe assumptions and requirements are obtained from discussions with appropriate personnel and\nby analysis of a space transportation reference baseline. Essentially, the requirements analyst is\nperforming the earliest stage of system engineering design. The task is to determine, thinking as\na designer, what data must be known to perform specific engineering designs at this level of\ndetail. The assumptions and requirements are identified in the thought process of considering\nwhat activities the STN must perform for each particular mission and vehicle passing through\nthe node.\nThe Civil Needs Data Base Option 3, Phase 2 initial years was used for the lunar missions\nscenario. Due to the fluid nature of a space program definition at this early planning stage and\nthe probable change in detail data, the requirements were formulated based on generalized\nmissions and flight schedules synthesized from three representative years of this lunar missions\nscenario.\nThe documentation of results is organized into the three sections of Source References, Assumptions and Groundrules, and STN Requirements. Data base methods were chosen as the medium\nfor recording the results. The use of data bases allows the identification of links between\nreferences, assumptions, and requirements. The data bases also enable flexibility and ease in\nreviewing and analyzing the results. Table 8.0-1 shows an example section of the requirements\ndatabase.\n29\n\nTable 8.0-1,\nWBS No.:\nSTN Element:\n\nLEO Space Transportation Node List of Requirements\n\n1.01\nMgthtegr\n\nRequirement ID:\nAssumptions:\n\n1\n\nRef:\n\nThe General Requirements in Section 2.1 of JSC 31000 also apply to the LEO STN; except for\nthe induced environment restrictions due to user accommodation.\nRationale:\n\nThe JSC 31000 general Space Station requirements appear to be appropriate\nfor the STN and represent more planning and analysis effort than is available\nfor derivation of similar requirements in this study.

Figure 9.0-1 illustrates the overall concept showing a departing stack\nand arriving heavy lift tanker. Figure 9.0-2 shows a three view. T i Space Transportation\nhs\nNode (STN) station is oriented exclusively toward the assembly, refurbishment, maintenance,\npropellant loading, checkout, and repeated reuse and launch of cargo and piloted vehicles going\nto the lunar surface.\nUp to eight flights per year to the lunar surface are to be supported. The transportation system\nconsists of a large single-stage reusable OTV that delivers a single-stage reusable\nlanderbauncher to low lunar orbit (LLO). The OTV waits in orbit for the lander to return. Both\nthen aerobrake back to the low Earth orbit (LEO) station using separate aerobrakes. Both\nvehicles are reloaded with propellant and refurbished at the LEO station. Though a specific\ntransportation system is used, a range of different transportation system (vehicle) options can be\naccommodated. The emphasis however, is on reusability for space-maintainable vehicles.\nThe station supports two stacks, each consisting of an OTV, lunar landerbauncher, and a payload. The single stage reusable landerbauncher delivers 25 m tons one way to the lunar surface\nor a 6 m ton crew capsule round trip fiom low lunar orbit (LLO). A stack departing LEO weighs\non the order of 200 m tons, including 158 m tons of cryogenic propellant.\nThe dry weight of the station, without propellants or OTVs and landers is approximately 400\nmetric tons. 182 m tons of cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen propellant is stored in four tanks.\nThe storage uses liquid acquisition devices to acquire the propellant for transfer to the OTVs and\nlanders. Passive thermal control is used and boil-off is used for orbital make-up propellant.\nWith two stacks fully loaded with propellant, and the storage tanks full, the station has a\nmaximum weight of approximately 1,000 m tons. Table 9.0-1 shows a summary weight\nstatement.\n75 kilowatts of continuous power is provided by a Phase 1 Space Station photo-voltaic system.\n75 kw of heat is rejected via a Space Station thermal control system. The station subsystems are\nin general taken directly from or derived from the Freedom Space Station design.\n\nThe two stacks can be assembled or serviced in parallel. Each stack is docked to a rotating\nfixture that turns to allow 360" access to the entire stack from a manipulator running up and\ndown the truss. The rotating fixture also allows pressurized access to the lunar crew module or\ncargo from the STN interior.\nThe two major assumptions of the design are; 1 ) the fully reusable, space-maintainable OTV and\nlander, and 2) the high maximum flight rate @/year). These assumptions require careful\nexamination in future work.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of a low lunar orbit station were also examined as part of this\neffort. A LLO STN in lunar equatorial orbit would allow the OTV and landers to always deliver\nmaximum payload which may be required in some lunar oxygen schemes to achieve reasonable\nmass efficiency. These scenarios generally assume a lunar based and maintained reusable\nlanderbauncher however and are probably not practical until well after a permanent lunar base is\nestablished. As the inclination of the lunar orbit goes up, the number of opportunities to arrive\n31\n\nI\n1\n\nI\n\nand depart the Moon without excessive delta-V penalties goes down. For these higher inclination lunar orbits an LLO STN adds another constraint that further complicates the window\nproblem. Delta V plots were generated that indicated inclinations of 10" and less can be made\nessentially equal to equatorial in their accessibility for a 15%penalty in LEO stack mass.\n\nI\nI\n\ni\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\n\nI\nI\n1\n32\n\nFigure 9.0-2, LEO Transportation Node Space Station for Lunar Base Support (three view)\n\nFront\n\n34\n\nISide\n\nTable 9.0-1,\n\nLEO Transportation Node Space Station Summary Weight Statement\n\nElements\nHangar\nPropellant Storage (4 Tanks, dry)\nTransfer lines, Interfaces, Other prop. related (wet)\nRemote Manipulator System with Transporter (2)\nTruss\nPower Supply\nHabitation Module 1 (Active)\nHabitation Module 2 (Quiet)\nWorkshop Module\nWorkshop Module\nPressurized Logistics Module\nNode 1 (forward starboard)\nNode 2 (forward port)\nNode 3 (starboard)\nNode 4 (port)\nNode 5 (for vert. with rotating fixture)\nNode 6 (starboard)\nNode 7 (port)\nNode 8 (Hangar Control)\nNode 9 (Aft)\nNode 10 (Aft Vert. with rotating fixture)\nAirlock 1 (Hyperbaric)\nAirlock 2\nCETAs\nThermal Control (Rad. & Pallets)\nCupola 1\nCupola 2\nCupola 3\nTunnel\nGN&C Pallets (2)\nRCS Tank Pallets (2)\nUtility Trays\nAntennas\nLander OTV Propellant Boom\nRCMs (6)\n\nlbs\n48,257\n122,652\n37,975\n7,200\n14,963\n57,059\n45,838\n4 1,260\n127,640\n227,640\n16,845\n34,283\n34,283\n34,283\n34,283\n34,283\n34,283\n34,283\n34,283\n34,283\n34,283\n8,254\n8,254\n4,209\n8,092\n3,000\n3,OOo\n3\n3,058\n\n1,782\n\n(15 3 5 1)\n(15,551)\n(1535 1)\n(15 3 5 1)\n(3,744)\n(3,744)\n(1,913)\n(3,678)\n( 1,364)\n(1,364)\n(1,364)\n(1,390)\n(4,385)\n(4,055)\n(13,550)\n(613)\n(909)\n(810)\n\nTotal (Dry)\nStored Cryogenic Propellant\n\n884,604\n400,000\n\n(401,686)\n(182,000)\n\nTotal (Wet)\nLoaded O W Stacks (2)\n\n1,284,604\n877,684\n\n(583,686)\n(398,947)\n\nTotal (Gross)\n\n2,162,288\n\n(982,633)\n\n35\n\n9,648\n8,922\n\n29,878\n1,348\n2,Ooo\n\nkgms\n(21,935)\n(55,751)\n( 17,222)\n(3,273)\n(6,801)\n(25,936)\n(20,835)\n(18,755)\n(12,564)\n(12,564)\n(7,657)\n(15,551)\n( 15351)\n( 15351)\n(15,551)\n(15,551)\n( 15,55 1)\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n10.0\n\nLunar Surface Transportation Systems Conceptual Design Summary\n\nConceptual designs for transportation vehicles to perfom three different baseline mission types\nwere produced.\nTo transport crews of two to four, unpressurized, on trips of up to 50 km, a six-wheeled,\narticulated vehicle was chosen. This vehicle, shown in Figure 10-1, has an unloaded mass of\n550 kg and is powered by four lithium metal sulfide batteries with 196 kg total mass and storing\n21 kwh. The maximum power requirement for this vehicle is predicted to be 2.15 kw, with 1.6\nkw required for locomotion.\nTo transport crews of four on traverses of up to 1,500 km from the base, a pressurized vehicle\nshown in Figure 1 is proposed. The vehicle is powered by shuttle-type hydrogerdoxygen fuel\ncells storing up to 7,000 kwh of energy. configured for a 3,000 k m traverse, the total train\nweighs 17,600 kg and requires 25 kw peak power. Environmental control is essentially open\nloop with used consumables retumed to the base for regeneration. The 1,500 km mission would\ninvolve numerous stops and crew excursions in suits. A trip time of 42 days is planned.\n\nTo transport crews beyond 1,500 km to the opposite side of the moon, the baseline lunar lander\n(see Figure 4.0-2) descending from orbit is proposed. A ballistic flyer, which would fly from the\nbase to the opposite side of the Moon and return was also studied, but high Delta V requirements\n(essentially twice that required to descend and ascend to low lunar orbit) make this vehicle large\nand impractical for near term scenarios. The difference is that the ballistic flyer must carry\nsufficient propellant for the trip out and the trip back, whereas the lunar lander is assumed to\nrefuel in lunar orbit between each trip to the surface. If the baseline lander was used as a\nballistic transport from the base to points on the surface and back, tank size would limit its range\nto less than 1,000 km from the base.\nA variety of subsystems were reviewed for each of these vehicles, including: power, propulsion,\n\nlocomotion, thermal control, pressure vessels, airlocks, extra-vehicular activity (EVA) systems,\nlife support, lighting, communication, radiation protection, and emergency breakdown. Selection criteria were developed. Numerous useful d e s of thumb were recorded.\nFuture work should concentrate on refining the conceptual design of the vehicles in terms of\npractical and operational considerations. For example, both vehicles need more improvements\nto accommodate the rugged "off-road\' service. The unpressurized vehicle steering, articulation,\nand suspensions need more conceptual design work. The pressurized vehicle design which is\nactually a train of vehicles requires more study to confirm the locomotion performance on lunar\nterrain. Finally, the subsystems for the pressurized vehicle al need a second iteration of design\nl\nstudy to achieve proper vehicle integration.\n\n36\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n1\nI\n1\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n11.0\n\nConceptual Design of a Lunar Base Solar Power Plant Summary\n\nThe objective of this study was to determine the viability of a solar powered lunar base. Study\nguidelines required that power plant growth occur incrementally with an ultimate capacity of\n100 k W continuously. The latitude of the base was given as 18" South based upon criteria other\nthan power systems siting.\nThe study required selection of the most rational static and dynamic conversion systems for\ncomparison. Based upon trade-off analyses, one of these was to be selected for a more in-depth\nanalysis of the impacts of a solar power system on a lunar base development.\nSeveral photovoltaic cell technologies were investigated in several configurations of fmed and\ntracked arrays. From these trade studies, a fixed flat array of gallium arsenide cells was selected\nfor comparison with a solar dynamic system. Lunar night energy is supplied from a Regenera,\npsi).\ntive Fuel Cell (RFC) system with H and 0, stored at pressures up to 20,673kpa (3,000\nRankine, Brayton and Stirling cycle engines were considered as dynamic candidates. Operation\nof any of these engines during the Lunar night with thermal energy storage was determined to be\nimpractical if the storage media is required to be transpo~ted\nfrom the earth. As a result, energy\nstorage is based on the use of an RFC which would be identical to that required for the photovoltaic system. Alternator output would be required to be converted to DC for the RFC. Based\nprimarily on weight, the Stirling cycle was selected for comparison with the photovoltaic system.\nThe primary obstacle to the successful use of solar power systems on the lunar surface is the\nextremely long period in each cycle in which solar energy is unavailable. As a result, the energy\nstorage system constitutes over 90 percent of the photovoltaic and over 50 percent of the\ndynamic system weights. The photovoltaic power generation portion of the system would weigh\napproximately one-eighth that of the corresponding Stirling generation equivalent, and is therefofe the logical candidate for the initial Lunar Solar Power Plant.\n\n,\nThe fust power plant module to be deployed would carry a portion of the reactants as gaseous H\nand 0,. The amount that would be necessary would be determined after operational timelines\nwere developed. The total mass to be transported would remain constant and the fs 25 k W\nut\nmodule would only require 1 . MT and 60 m3 of payload capacity. Landed mass for a 100 k W\n25\ncontinuous power system is 50 MT. The most difficult part of the power plant installation\nappears to be the placement and burial of the reactant tanks which is required for thermal and\nmicrometeorite protection. Equipment handling and trenching machinexy must be landed prior\nto the first power plant module.\nFigure 11.0-1 depicts a roll-out, flat-plate solar array configuration for a 100 kW (net) system.\nThe fuel/electrolysis cell modules and associated tanks are sized for 25 kW each, a size well\nsuited for logistics and incremental power plant buildup. A f~ segment is shown being\ndeployed illustrating power plant growth. There are no known limitations to the size of a power\nplant so constructed. Being modularized allows for flexibility in siting individual segments so\nthat "mini"power plants may be located closer to the users. Thus it seems reasonable to\nconsider the photovoltaic/regenerative fuel cell power system for lunar surface applications into\nthe multi-megawatt power range or until nuclear sources becomes available.\n\n38\n\nI\nFigure 11.0-1, Lunar Base 100 kwe Solar Power Plant\n\n39\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nBLACK PtNO WHlTE PHOTOGRAPH\n\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\n1\n1\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\n\nI\nI\n1\n\n1.\n20\n\nSurface Construction and Assembly Equipment Summary\n\nThis study was initiated to develop requirements for equipment to be used in constructing and\nassembling a permanently manned lunar base. A survey of lunar construction and assembly\ntasks was made and the requirements that these tasks place on construction equipment were\nidentified. Major construction tasks that are most likely to occur during construction of a lunar\nbase primarily involve cargo and soil handling operations such as:\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nUnloading cargo from lunar landers.\nTransporting loads.\nLifting and positioning loads.\nPreparing the lunar surface for a base site, landing pads, and roads.\nProviding quantities of lunar soil for habitat radiation protection.\nAssembling large structures.\n\nCargo handling system requirements include maximum cargo size and weight that must be\nmanaged, transportation distance to be traversed, and maximum lift and reach that these systems\nmust have to unload and position the cargo. The maximum weight that cargo unloading and\ntransporting equipment must be able to handle is fixed by the payload capability of the lunar\nlander which, for a lander concept recently studied (3), is on the order of 25,000 kg. Cargo size\ninfluences transporter size as well as road width. Sizes of a number of potential cargo elements\nfor a lunar base are reviewed in this report. Cargo size has generally been constrained to the\nShuttle payload bay envelope and the maximum cargo dimension identified was 4.5 m x 14 m.\nHowever, availability of heavy lift launch vehicles could allow delivery of payloads with greater\ndiameter. Required lift and reach is dictated by lunar lander dimensions and cargo manifesting\nconfiguration.\nSoil handling system requirements include the quantity of soil needed for radiation protection,\nand the required grade or slope and the amount of soil to be moved to prepare the base site,\nlanding pads, and roads. Lunar terrain and crater density as well as the size of the base elements\neffects the magnitude of these jobs and the type of equipment needed. For instance, a partially\nburied inflatable spherical habitat would require such a large excavation that blasting will\nprobably be necessary which means a mobile drill unit will be needed. A base constructed of\nburied modules would not require excavating or blasting.\nAn important element missing from the ,requirements is the amount of time allowed in the\nschedule for completing the various construction tasks and the quantity of crew time (extra- and\nhtravehicular activity time) available to support the activities. Timing has a direct bearing on\nthe required size and number of equipment, and can influence the type of construction equipment\nselected. More study is required to better define both task and timing requirements.\n\nThe severity of the lunar environment (dust, vacuum, deep thermal and long diurnal cycles) and\nits remoteness dictates that lunar construction aquipment concepts should have the following\ngoals:\n0\n\nVersatility: The systems can be made capable of performing multiple tasks by attaching\ndifferent implements.\n\n40\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nCommonality: A modular design and common subsystem approach should be pursued\nwhere practical to reduce spares and maintenance requirements.\nReliability: Dust-control, lubrication, and maintenance will be important design considerations.\nLow Weight: Although the equipment must be rugged for reliability, lunar materials\n(soil or rocks) could be used as counterweights and/or ballast to improve the stability\nand/or traction of the equipment and to reduce the machine\xe2\x80\x99s E r h launch weight.\nat\nTelerobotics: The systems should be capable of both manual and teleoperated operation\nto potentially reduce JWA requirements.\n\nTerrestrial construction equipment functions and capability are described. Several versatile\nmachine combinations are commonly used on E r h construction sites, such as a backhoe frontat\nend loader machine and a boom crane with multiple attachments for hoisting, grappling, and\nexcavating.\n\nII\n1\n\nm\n\nA preliminary comparison was made of equipment options to perform the lunar construction/assembly task set. More work is needed before an optimum set of equipment can be selected\nwith confidence. Figures 12.0-1 and 12.0-2 show representative concepts. The comparison did\nindicate that one possible set of equipment that could perform the lunar tasks would consist of\nthe following major equipment elements:\n0\n\nI\n0\n\nI\n1\n1\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\n0\n\nMobile boom crane. The boom crane would be used to hoist cargo off landers and\nsurface transporters, place soil over habitation elements for radiation protection, and\nprovide a backup to the soil excavator. Crane attachments needed for these operations\ninclude a hoisting hook and cargo sling, dumpable soil transfer bucket, and a pile-driving\nram to emplace anchors.\nSoil excavator and surface graderfleveler. Capability for excavatinggrading could be\nprovided by a front-end loader using a multi-application bucket which can be used as a\nshovel, bulldozer blade, or scraper. For deeper excavations, a front-end loader and a\nbackhoe machine mounted on a single prime mover tractor is a possibility. A compactor\nroll attachment can be provided for the prime mover tractor, and pulled to compact the\nlunar surface. Other excavators, such as a bucket wheel excavator, should also be\nexamined in more detail.\nHaulers. Several flatbed cargo transporters are required with mounting cradles for constraining large cargo elements. Soil transport trucks will be required if large soil volumes\nmust be moved in short time periods.\nAuxiliary Equipment. Miscellaneous equipment needed for the job set includes a ramp\nor chute for contingency lander unloading operations, jacks for lifting a lander (in the\nevent a lander needs to be moved), a local transportation vehicle (LOTRAN) for crew\ntransport, and rock and soil drills for blasting large boulders or large excavations if\nneeded. Requirements for blasting need more definition. A small drill rig could be\nattached to a prime mover to provide mobility. A drill device used for scientific coring\ncould double as a construction tool.\n41\n\ni\n\nIt is recommended that conceptual designs be developed for several construction equipment\nelements to accomplish a well defined set of tasks within a preliminary schedule. Trade studies\nare required to better define the primary power source, propulsion means (wheels vs. tracks), and\nactuator/control systems (hydraulic, electric, mechanical linkage). M r detailed study of\noe\nrequirements for teleoperation of these vehicles from a lunar base and from E r h is also needed.\nat\n\n42\n\nORlGIMAL PAf>E\nEjLACK MJlI \'/VkjJTE P I - Q \' T W R ~\n\nFigure 12.0-1, Crane with Bucket, Front-End Loader, and Hauler\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nFigure 12.0-2, Crane Unloads Module on to Transporter\n\n44\n\n!-)e, I;<>, p;?&r,\nc;\nBLACK AND WHITE PtiO I-IJGRAPH\n\n13.0\n\nLunar Application of SuperconductivityStudy Summary\n\nSuperconductors are materials that exhibit zero electrical resistance when cooled to temperatures\nbelow a critical value characteristic of the material. Until recently, these temperatures have been\nin the 1-40\xc2\xb0K range, which requires that the material be cooled using expensive liquid helium.\nThe past two years have seen advances in the development of high-temperature superconductors\nthat have led to a resurgent interest in their potential applications. Materials are being discovered that achieve superconducting characteristics at temperatures over 100\xc2\xb0K,allowing cooling\nwith relatively inexpensive liquid nitrogen. Research is continuing to find a room-temperature\nsuperconductor that will require no refrigeration.\nMagnets constructed of superconducting materials are fmding many applications because of their\nability to store large amounts of energy in their coils in the form of electrical current with\nvirtually no energy loss. They have the added advantage of being dischargeable i durations\nn\nranging from a fraction of a second to many hours or days. Three applications of superconductor\nmagnet technology at a lunar base are discussed in this report: magnetic energy storage during\nthe lunar day for usage during the night; electromagnetic rail launchers to propel lunar-derived\noxygen or raw materials into lunar orbit; and magnetic shielding to protect lunar inhabitants\nfrom radiation.\nThe practical usage of superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) devices to store large\namounts of energy has been proven through the development of prototypes by several research\ninstitutes and utility companies. Current technology makes them competitive with capacitor\nstorage but not yet with fuel cells. SMES devices are practical as energy storage units only at\nstored levels above 500 MWH (1.5 MW delivered for 14 days), which corresponds to lunar\nenergy storage requirements at the early settlement phase (100 person) or perhaps for propellant\nplants.\nSeveral geometries are considered for the coil, and a toroid shape is recommended to eliminate\nfringe fields. Such a device would be about 200 meters in diameter and 30 meters high to store\n500 MWH.\nCurrent terrestrial designs require cooling of the coil w t liquid helium or liquid nitrogen in\nih\n\norder for the devices to achieve their superconducting characteristics. Low temperature on the\nMoon may eliminate this need, though, making SMES even more competitive. Devices situated\nabove the surface can be shaded with artificial shadows, producing operating temperatures of\nabout 110\xc2\xb0K. Superconducting materials already exist that work at this temperature, but higher\ncurrent densities than those experimentally achieved are necessary before these can be used for\npractical energy storage. An above-ground SMES device would require strong containment,\nprobably with steel, to withstand the large hoop stresses generated by the coil. The device could\nbe buried in lunar bedrock to contain these forces, but a subsurface temperature of 2 0 K would\n3\xc2\xb0\nrequire the discovery of a new superconductor material with a critical temperature higher than\nthis.\nSome advantages of SMES over other technologies include high efficiency, high reliability, and\nhigh energy density.\nSuperconductor technology has made possible the development of electromagnetic launchers\n(EML), which require the delivery of high energy in short bursts of power. EML designs have\n45\n\nbeen proposed that are capable of accelerating 1,000 kgs at 1,OOO gravities to 12.3 km/s. These\ndevices offer several advantages over rocket launch systems, including a higher payload fraction,\ngreater launch rate, lower launch unit cost, and greater reliability.\nTwo families of EML are discussed: railgun and coaxial. Railgun devices consist of two\nparallel rails connected to a pulsed direct current with a projectile propelled between the rails by\nLorentz forces generated in the projectile\xe2\x80\x99s armature. Coaxial devices use a linear synchronous\nmotor to accelerate payload buckets containing energized coils along an assembly of fixed\ncoaxial coils several kilometers in length. Coaxial EML\xe2\x80\x99s offer several advantages over railguns,\na including larger bore diameters for the projectiles, greater efficiency, longer life span, and the\nability to operate well at moderate accelerations. A problem with coaxial EML\xe2\x80\x99s is the generation of large internal voltages that could cause arcing.\nThe development of high temperature superconductors has led to the application of quenching\nmethods to a lunar electromagnetic launcher. This method uses successive switching on and off\n(quenching) of adjacent coils to propel the projectile. Problems with this approach that need\nfurther attention include the requirement to withstand high magnetic induction, high current\ndensities, and large stresses. The advantage over other coaxial designs is the elimination of the\nneed for superconducting switches. Quenchguns may be able to accelerate lo00 kg payloads to\n1.7 km/s. Figure 13.0-1 shows a concept for an EML, on the lunar surface inside a shielded,\npressurized volume.\nFurther study needs to be performed to determine the tradeoffs of electromagnetic launchers\nversus reusable landers for oxygen and raw material transport.\n\nA major concern of lunar mission planners is the exposure of astronauts to high levels of cosmic\nradiation, and occasional high-radiation dosages from solar flares. To safeguard the astronauts,\nradiation shielding must be considered for lunar habitats. The large magnetic fields generated in\nsuperconducting magnets may be beneficial for trapping charge particles away from the habitats.\nTwo approaches are considered here: toroidal magnetic shielding and plasma core shielding.\nThe cosmic ray spectrum must be cut off at 10-15 GeV/nncleon to achieve an acceptable dosage\nrate of 5 r d y e a r . It is estimated that on the order of 4.5 metric tons/m2 of passive shielding is\nrequited to provide this protection. If active magnetic shielding is used, current densities of lo\xe2\x80\x99\namps/mz are required to achieve ti cutoff, a value approachable only with the use of superconhs\nducting coil materials.\nThree configurations are considered for magnetic shielding:\n0\n\nAn unconfined field dipole, which is toroidal in shape producing a shield outside the\n\ntorus,\ne\n\nA confined field double torus, which places one toroid inside another and traps the\nparticles between them, and\n\ne\n\nA hybrid of the two in which a deformed toroidal winding is used to produce a spherical\nshape.\n\n46\n\nThe hybrid magnetic shield is the most attractive configuration because it leads to the lowest\ndosage rate and has the lowest system mass.\n\nA plasma core shield creates a huge electric field around the habitat that deflects positively\ncharged cosmic rays back into space. The attraction of surrounding electrons could neutralize\nthe device, but superconducting magnets are arranged to create an electron well that traps these\nelectrons. The advantage of a plasma core shield over a magnetic shield is that no electrons\noccur near the exterior surfaces of the habitat. The major disadvantage is the extremely high\nvoltages required, which may cause arcing between the habitat and ground. To overcome the\narcing problem, a system that combines passive mass shielding and low-power magnetic\nshielding may be desireable.\n\n47\n\nFigure 13.0-1,Electromagnetic Launcher on the Lunar Surface\n\nBLACK A N D WEITE PHOTOGRAPH\n\n48\n\n14.0\n\nLunar Base Scenario Cost Estimates\n\nThis report describes the estimated development and production costs, in constant 1988 dollars,\nof each of the systems conceptually designed under the Advanced Space Transportation Support\nContract. In addition, estimates were derived for a unit cost (dollars per kilogram) to transport\nthe systems from Earth to the Lunar surface and for a unit cost (dollars per EVA and WA hour)\nto set up the systems on the Lunar surface. These estimates do not include the cost of spares,\nconsumables, new facilities for system development and production, or ongoing operations on\nthe lunar surface.\nThe ASTS contract did not include provisions for designing crew habitation and laboratory\nmodules, nor for costing them. However, a price tag for the entire lunar system would not be\ncomplete without their inclusion. Solely for the purpose of providing a more complete picture of\nlunar system costs, gross cost estimates were made for these modules, using a cost estimating\nrelationship developed for estimating space station module costs [1 1 The projected pressurized\n4.\nvolume is 658.17m3, and includes two habitation modules, one laboratory, one node, and two\nairlocks. The projected cost for pressurized volume is $4028/m3, $2,651,000,000 the\nor\nfor\n:\nentire system. The development to production cost ratio was assumed to be 3l for these\nmodules.\nTable 14.0-1summarizes the total system hardware costs, and Table 14.0-2\nsummarizes the unit\ncosts for transport and setup.\nTable 14.0-1, Summary of Lunar Base Scenario Estimated Costs ($Millions)\nSystem\nLunar Lander\nLunar Oxygen Pilot Plant\nUnpressurized Lunar Rover\nPressurized Lunar Rover\nSolar Power Plant\nLogistics Module\nStom Shelter\nTransportation Node\nSurface Construction Equipment\nFuel Cell Cart\nSupplemental Cooling Cart\nOrbital Transfer Vehicle\nLow Earth Orbit Launcher\nLunar Landing Pad\nSurface Habitatsbabs\nTotal\n\nDevelopment\n\n$1,415\n732\n140\n474\n314\n242\n241\n7,219\n350\n70\n45\n1,464\n4,162\n581\n1,988\n\nProduction\n$ 649\n\nTotal\n\n122\n47\n184\n118\n108\n70\n\n9,580\n429\n82\n52\n2,523\n17,328\n685\n2,651\n\n$18,750\n\n49\n\n31 1\n\n2,361\n79\n13\n7\n1,059\n13,166\n104\n663\n\n$19,437\n\n$2,064\n854\n187\n658\n432\n350\n\n$38,186\n\nTable 14.0-2, Summary of Lunar Base Scenario Transport and Setup Costs\nODeration\nTransport\nEarth-Lunar Surface\n\nu i cost\nnt\n\n$ 23,732bg\n\nSetup\nEVA\nIVA\n\n$84,237/hour\n$29,483/hour\n\nn\nAs a point of comparison, the Apollo program cost $93 Billion i 1988 dollars.\n\n50\n\n15.0\n\nSpacecraft M s Estimation, Relationships, and Engine Data Summary\nas\n\nAt the first of the software task a variety of information was collected to aid in weight estimation. The book produced contains a collection of scaling equations, weight statements, scaling\nfactors, etc., useful to someone doing conceptual design of translunar spacecraft. It provides\nrules of thumb and methods for calculating quantities of interest. Basic relationships for\nconventional--and several non-conventional--propulsion\nsystems (nuclear and solar electric, and\nsolar thermal) are included. The equations and other data have been taken from a number of\nsources and are not all consistent with each other in level of detail or method, but provide useful\nreferences for early estimation purposes. Table 15.0-1 exemplifies the data collected.\nScaling equations are presented on two levels: overall vehicle sizing and subsystem sizing. The\nequations for overall vehicle sizing are quick and simple. They should be used when extreme\naccuracy is not a prerequisite. When higher fidelity is required, and time is not an overriding\nconcern, the vehicle can be sized by subsystem, using the subsystem sizing equations and\nrelationships.\nVehicle subsystems can be broken down in any number of ways. To prevent confusion, a list of\ngeneral subsystems discussed throughout this book is presented here:\nPropellant\nEngines\nAvionics\nStructures\nAerobrakes and Heatshields\nEnvironmental Control and Life Support\nCrew\nPower and Electrical\nLanding and Docking\nPropellant T n s\nak\nInsulation and Thermal Protection\nAttitude Control\nThe relationships and other numbers collected here are primarily for Orbital Transfer Vehicles\n( O n \xe2\x80\x99 s )operating between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Low Lunar Orbit (LLO), and for lunar\nsurface 1anderAaunchers.\n\n51\n\n.B\n\nM\n\na\n\na^\n\nQ\nn\nk\n\nW\n\n3\n\ni\ni\n\nvl\n\n8\n\ncd\n\n31\n\n&\n3\n1\n\n3\ncd\n\nY\n\n8\nu\n\n.B\n\nLs"\n3\n8\nn\n\n0\n\n&\n\nv\n\n16.0\n\nEarth to Low Lunar Orbit and Back (all in plane) Trajectory Program (LLOFX)\n\nThe program LLOFX calculates in-plane trajectories from an Earth-orbiting space station to\nLunar orbit in such a way that the journey requires only two delta-v bums (one to leave Earth\ncircular orbit and one to circularize into lunar orbit). The program requires the user to supply the\nspace station altitude and lunar orbit altitude (in kilometers above the surface), and the desired\ntime of flight for the transfer (in hours). It then determines and displays the Trans-Lunar\nInjection (TLI)\ndelta-v required to achieve the transfer, the Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) delta-v\nrequired to circularize the orbit around the Moon, the actual time of flight, and whether the\ntransfer orbit is elliptical or hyperbolic. Return information is also displayed. Finally, a plot of\nthe transfer orbit is displayed.\nCalculation of the trajectory takes advantage of the fact that the Moon travels at great velocity in\norbit around the Earth (1.02 kilometers per second). The vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s circular orbit about the Earth\nis turned into an elliptical transfer orbit that intercepts the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. This transfer orbit is\nrotated ahead of the Earth-Moon line in such a way that, as the vehicle enters the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s Sphere\nof Action (SOA)\nahead of the Moon, the high velocity of the Moon in the direction of the vehicle\ncauses the vehicle to appear to be headed back toward the Moon (from a Lunar point of view).\nThis program identifies the eccentricity, size, and rotation of the transfer ellipse or hyperbola\nthat causes the velocity vector of the vehicle (in Lunar coordinates) to correspond to an orbit\npassing in front of the Moon with a perigee at the Lunar orbit altitude supplied by the user.\n\n53\n\n17.0\n\nEarth to Low Lunar Orbit and Back (Variable Geometry) Trajectory Program (PLANECHG)\n\nThe program PLANECHG calculates velocities for Earth-to-Moon or Moon-to-Earth trajectories. The flight to be analyzed originates in a circular orbit of any inclination and altitude about\none of the bodies, and culminates in a circular orbit of any inclination and altitude about the\nother body. An intermediate AV and plane change occurs at the lunar sphere of influence (SOI),\nthe region where the vehicle is near its lowest velocity in the trajectory, and therefore where it is\nable to make the plane change with the lowest AV. This results in a three-burn trajectory.\n\nA given flight may penetrate the SO1 at a number of points. Each point has associated with it a\nunique set of AV\xe2\x80\x99s and total velocity. This program displays the velocities, in matrix form, for a\nrepresentative set of SO1 penetration points. An SO1 point is identified by projecting Lunar\nlatitude and longitude onto the SOI. The points reported for a given flight are defined by the\nuser, who provides a starting longitude and latitude, and an increment for each. A matrix is built\nwith ten longitudes forming the columns and 19 latitudes forming the rows. This matrix is\npresented in six different reports, each report containing different velocity or node information in\nthe body of the matrix.\nThe technical and user documentation describes the inputs provided by the user to defme the\nflight profile and the contents of the six reports that are produced as outputs. Instructions to\nexecute this program, and a look at the structure and details of the program code are also\nincluded.

It is a three degree-of-freedom simulation which is used to analyze the\ntranslational motion of the vehicle during descent. Attitude dynamics and rotational motion are\nnot considered.\nThe program can be used to simulate either an ascent from the Moon or a descent to the Moon.\nFor an ascent, the spacecraft is initialized at the lunar Surface and accelerates vertically away\nfrom the ground at f l thrust. When the local velocity becomes 30 ft/s, the vehicle turns\nul\ndownrange with a pitch-over maneuver and proceeds to fly a gravity turn until Main Engine\nCutoff (MECO). The spacecraft then coasts until it reaches the requested holding orbit where it\nperforms an orbital insertion bum. Figure 18.0-1 is an example of ascent output.\nDuring a descent simulation, the lander begins in the holding orbit and performs a deorbit bum.\nIt then coasts to periapsis, where it reignites its engines and begins a gravity turn descent. When\nthe local horizontal velocity becomes zero, the lander pitches up to a vertical orientation and\nbegins to hover in search of a landing site. The lander hovers for a period of time specified by\nthe user, and then lands.\nNewton-Raphson iteration techniques are used to optimize the pitch-over maneuver and the\nMECO time for proper orbit insertion. Integration is performed using a Runge-Kutta fourth\norder integrator. This integrator has been verified with launch simulations of the Titan and\nConestoga launch vehicles. LANDER receives input, presents output, and does a l calculations\nl\nin English units. The basic coordinate system is spherical. The Moon is modelled as a spherical\nbody of uniform gravity having no atmosphere and no gravitational harmonics.\nEven though the output for a descent simulation appears to start at orbit and end at the surface,\nthe mathematical calculations are performed in reverse. The program actually initializes the\nlander at the lunar Surface and proceeds to simulate an ascent using negative mass flow. After\nthe proper orbit has been achieved the data is recognized and printed in the proper chronological\nsequence for a descent. Note: that t i "reversed flight" is only characteristic of the descent\nhs\nsimulations. Apollo descent simulations used this same "reversed" technique to decrease the\nrequired number of iterations needed to find a satisfactory trajectory.\n\n56\n\nFigure 18.0-1, LANDER Example Output\n\n1\n\nOUTPUT:\nT\n\nb\n\n<\n>\n.\n\n0.\n\n5.\n10.\n15.\n20.\n25.\n\n30.\n35.\n\n40.\n4s.\n50.\n\n55.\n60.\n65.\n70.\n75.\n\n80.\n85.\n\nUt i t u d a\n<it>\n\n9\n.\n<run>\n\nVdocity\n<t.\ni/>\n\n0.\n71.\n267.\n590.\n1038.\n1612.\n2310.\n3129.\n4067.\n5120.\n6286.\n7559.\n8936.\n10412.\n11981.\n13639.\n15380.\n17199.\n\n0.\n\n2.\n27.\n52.\n78.\n104.\n131.\n159.\n187.\n216.\n246.\n276.\n308.\n340.\n373.\n407.\n\n0.\n0.\n0.\n0.\n0.\n0.\n0.\n\n0.\n0.\n\n0.\n1.\n1.\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n2.\n\n2.\n\n443.\n\n479.\n516.\n\n0\n-\n\n<dog>\n90.00\n\n90.00\n84.34\n81.47\n70 .58\n75.71\n72.87\n70.08\n67.35\n64.68\n62.07\n59. 55\n57.09\n54.72\n52.42\n50.21\n48.08\n46.02\n\nHmadinq\n<dag>\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n81.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n\nThn2.t\n\n<lbf>\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n\n3SOO.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n\n3500.\n3500.\n\nUaight\n(110015.\n10858.\n10803.\n10743.\n10686.\n10629.\n10572.\n10515.\n10457.\n10400.\n10343.\n10286.\n10229.\n10172.\n10114.\n10057.\n10000.\n9943.\n\n0\n\ns\na\n\n325.\n330.\n335.\n340.\n\nI\nI\n\n345.\n\n350.\n\n355.\n\nHOLLXNG ORBITO\n-N\n\nI\nI\n\n-\n\n5\n\n* M\nN ,\n\n0\n\nNGHTPATHANGLEATPIICH-OVER?\nAmswcc\n\n85\n\nHOLDING ORBIT INcLINAnoN 7 (0 TO 360)\nhuwec\n\n26.2\n\nDO YOU WISH To SEE THE TRAJECI\xe2\x80\x99ORY OF EACH IlEftATION 7\nh m e c N\n\n360.\n365.\n370.\n375.\n380.\n385.\n390.\n395.\n400.\n405.\n\n410.\n415.\n420.\n425.\n430.\n435.\n440.\n445.\n\n109036.\n109926.\n110758.\n111532.\n112250.\n112912.\n113S20.\n114075.\n114S79.\n115032.\n115438.\n115797.\n116111.\n116384.\n116616.\n116012.\n116973.\n117102.\n117203.\n117278.\n117931.\n117365.\n117984.\n117393.\n117395.\n\n75.\n78.\n81.\n85.\n88.\n91.\n95.\n98.\n101.\n105.\n109.\n112.\n116.\n120.\n124.\n128.\n132.\n137.\n141.\n145.\n150.\n154.\n159.\n164.\n168.\n\n3315.\n3392.\n3470.\n3549.\n3628.\n3708.\n3789.\n3871.\n3953.\n4036.\n4120.\n4205.\n4291.\n4377.\n4464.\n4s53.\n4641.\n4731.\n4822.\n4913.\n5006.\n5099.\n\n3.18\n2.91\n2.65\n2.41\n2.18\n1.96\n1.76\n1.57\n1.39\n1.22\n1.06\n0.92\n0.78\n0.66\n0.55\n0.45\n0.36\n0.28\n0.21\n0.15\n0.10\n0.06\n\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n87.63\n\n1193.\n\n0.03\n\nB7.63\n\n3500.\n\n5288.\n5384.\n\n0.01\n\n87.63\n87.63\n\n3500.\n3500.\n\n0.00\n\nApocynthion\nPmricynthion\nInCliXl8tiOn\nLongitude of the Asceding Node\nkgurm+ o f P e r i c y n t h i o n\nEccentricity\n\n-------\n\n36.6000\n19.3000\n26.2500\n283.0000\n91.2600\n0.0089\n\nVmlocity Rmquirod at Apocynthion t o Achieve\n\n57\n\n3SOO.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n3500.\n\n-\n\n6254.70 <it/.>\n\nIdeal Performance D e l t a V d o c i t y i a :\nDooat Orbit:\n\n3500.\n3500.\n\n<nnv\n<deg>\n<dog>\n\n<dmg>\n< e\nn\n\n7198.\n7140.\n7083.\n7026.\n6969.\n6912.\n6855.\n6797.\n6740.\n6683.\n6626.\n6569.\n6511.\n6454.\n6397.\n6340.\n6283.\n6225.\n6168.\n6111.\n6054.\n5997.\n5940.\n5882.\n5825.\n\n19.0\n\nEarth to Low Lunar Orbit and Back (all in-plane) Low Thrust Program (CISLUNAR)\n\nCISLUNAR is a stand alone program designed to generate the trajectory of a low-thrust\nspacecraft travelling in Earth-Moon space. The program allows the creation of functional\ntrajectories dependent upon the supplied spacecraft characteristics. The trajectory generation is a\nuser interactive process. The program user must modify the necessary control values to create a\nsatisfactory trajectory. Figure 19.0-1illustrates example output.\nInitial screen display information shows the spacecraft\'s default characteristics. These characteristics can be modified by the user at the beginning of each run. The program prompts the user\nfor the direction of the trajectory generation by asking whether the initial orbit is about the Earth\nor the Moon. This sets the direction flags for the rest of the program. Initial altitude, velocity,\nand orbital position of the spacecraft must be entered. The altitude must be input for the\nil\nprogram to continue. The velocity wl default to the circular velocity at the input altitude.\nFour guidance controls are specified, Jacl, Jac2, Jac3, and Range. These four values govern the\nthrusting of the spacecraft during the h a l escape and translunar portions of the trajectory. Jac 1\nindicates the spacecraft is nearing the end of its spiral escape from the initial orbit; the engines\nshut down, and thrusting ceases unless the spacecraft is in the proper quadrant for transfer\ninjection. Jac 2 is the control that determines whether the spacecraft can achieve a cislunar\nt\ntrajectory. Ideally the Jacobian Constant a Jac 2 has a value of 3 & .2 km/s. After reaching Jac\n2, the spacecraft thrusts continuously. Jac 3 is the final constraint on the amount energy for the\nspacecraft to have during transfer. Following Jac 3, the spacecraft does not thrust. Range is the\ncontrol that determines the distance from the initial planet that the capture guidance to the target\nplanet is begun. This is the point at which reverse thrusting begins.\nMarkers for these four controls show up on the trajectory as each of them is passed. For Jac 1 Jac 3, a small circle will indicate that t i control has been reached. The passage of Range is\nhs\nindicated by a small vertical line. The visual representation of the controls is helpful to\nunderstand and plan a modification of the controls. The markers do not appear in FORTRAN\nversions of the program.\nIn the development of trajectories for low-thrust cislunar O m s , little attention has been directed\n\nat the guidance and control of the spacecraft. The premise that the guidance of the vehicle and\nthe determination of the appropriate trajectory are unrelated is false. Rather guidance and\ntrajectory determination are closely related problems which by necessity must be treated with\nequal importance.\n\n58\n\n@E pc%lR\n\nFigure 19.0-1, CISLUNAR Example Output\n\nQL0PtLITY\n\nCISLUNAR Output BASIC V d o n\n\n%Yh\nto loon Irdectory\nInit, k s : 688881 FN , k s :18388,031 ky Dist, Earth :3799#,98 k\nIiH elapsed : W , 6 8\nel :111Bs6 Ws\nDist, loon : 5 5 , k\n8 8g\nJacobian : 2 531678175551726\nI\n\nR :Restart Q:quit\n\nf :Pause C :60\n\n?\n\nCISLUNAR Output: FORTRAN Version\nEarth\n\nI\n\nE\n\n-1.oQoo\n\nMoon\n\nTrajectory\n\nn\n\n.\n\n-zoo00\n\nto\n\n.\n\'--f.000d-2.0000\'-1 .OOO&.oooO\n\n-$\n\n.OOOO \'2.0000 .3.0000 \'4.0000 .5.0000\n\nOiatomce w i t h roapoct to baycmntor\n\n59\n\n.lo.\n\n20.0\n\nEarth to L2, L3, LA and L5 and LLO to L1 and L2 and Back Trajectory Program\n(LIBRATE)\n\nThe program LIBRATE calculates velocities for trajectories from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to four\nof the five known libration points (L2,L3, LA, L5), and from Low Lunar Orbit (LLO) to\nlibration points L1 and L2. Libration Points (LP) are defined as locations in space that orbit the\nEarth such that they are always stationary with respect to the Earth-Moon line. Libration point\n#2 (L2) is located between the E r h and Moon where the gravitational attraction from both\nat\nbodies are equal. L1 and L3 are located behind the Moon and Earth, respectively, such that the\npull of the Earth and Moon together just cancel the centrifugal acceleration associated with the\nlibration point\'s orbit. LA and L5 are located half-way between the Earth and the Moon and 60"\noff the Earth-Moon line to the left and right, respectively. Hence, the Earth, Moon, and all\nlibration points, lie in the same plane.\n\nrm\nThe flight to be analyzed departs f o a circular orbit of any altitude and inclination about the\nEarth or Moon and finished in a circular orbit about the Earth at the desired libration point within\na specified flight time. First, the departure orbit is made into a more eccentric orbit (ellipse or\nhyperbola) with an initial AV in order to reach the libration point while meeting the flight time\nconstraint. The less the desired flight time, the more eccentric the orbit, and the larger the initial\nAV required. The least eccentric elliptic orbit would require the minimum AV and the maximum\nflight time. A second AV is then needed once the elliptic or hyperbolic flight path has reached\nthe libration point in order to change the velocity vector of the eccentric trajectory to that of the\nlibration point\'s orbit (circularize). So, the more eccentric the orbit, the larger the velocity\nchange. This second bum must also account for the inclination of the eccentric trajectory with\nrespect to the Earth-Moon-LP plane.\nThis program produces a matrix of the AV\'s needed to complete the desired flight. The user\nspecifies the departure orbit (location and altitude), and the maximum flight time. A matrix is\nthen developed with 10 inclinations (with respect to the Earth-Moon-LP plane), ranging from 0"\nto 90\xc2\xb0, forming the columns, and 19 possible flight times, ranging from the flight t h e (input) to\n36 hours less than the input value, in decrements of 2 hours, fonning the rows. This matrix is\npresented in three different reports including the total AV\'s and both of the AV components\ndiscussed above. Table 20.0-1 shows example output.\nLIBRATE was derived in part from the PLANECHG program, discussed in a different, more\ndetailed documentation report. Therefore, for a more in-depth look at many of the equations,\nvariables, and conventions used in LJBRATE, PLANECHG documentation may be consulted.\n\n60\n\nTable 20.0-1, LIBRATE Example Output\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\nm\n\n0\n\n0\n\na\n0\n0\n\nr\n0\n0\nW\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\nm\n\n0\n0\n\nw\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nm\n\n0\n0\n\nCJ\n\nE\nt\n\n0\n\n0\n\nd\n\n0\n0\n\nB\n61\n\n2.\n10\n\nEarth to L1 and Return Trajectory Program (LP1)\n\nThe program LP1 calculates outbound and return trajectories between low earth orbit (LEO) and\nlibration point #1 (Ll). Libration points (LP) are defined as locations in space that orbit the\nEarth such that they are always stationary with respect to the Earth-Moon line. L1 is located\nbehind the Moon such that the pull of the Earth and Moon together just cancel the centrifugal\nacceleration associated with the libration point\'s orbit.\nThe outbound flights depart from a circular orbit of any altitude and inclination about the Earth\nand culminate in a circular orbit about the Earth at libration point #I within a specified flight\ntime. The flight involves three bums.\nFirst, the departure orbit is made into a more eccentric orbit (ellipse or hyperbola) with an initial\nAV in order to reach the lunar sphere of influence ( O ) a region where the vehicle is near its\nSI,\nlowest velocity in the trajectory. The SO1 is a spherical region whose surface normally includes\nall the points at a distance of 11% of the Earth-Moon distance from the Moon\'s center. However, in order to simplQ the calculations t i radius was increased to include L1, enlarging the\nhs\nsphere radius to 15% of the Earth-Moon distance. This change in SO1 radius should not change\nt\nthe results significantly. A given flight may penetrate the SO1 a a number of points identified\nby projecting lunar latitude and longitude onto the SOI. For each flight the program will\ncalculate a set of possible trajectories associated with a set of SO1penetration points--a matrix of\nlongitudes and latitudes.\nNext, a second burn is calculated involving a "flyby" of the Moon from the SO1 point above the\nfront side of the Moon to L1 behind the back side. The SO1 penetration point and L1 will always\nbe the same distance from the center of the Moon. From the geometry of the trajectory it is\napparent that the Lunar "flyby" perigee altitude, supplied by the user, wiU occur midway\nbetween the SO1 point and L1. Consequently, the geometry of the orbit will force true anomaly,\nflight path angle, and absolute time to or from perigee passage to be the same for both the SO1\nand L1 points. There are two paths between these points, posigrade and retrograde. LP1\ncalculates only posigrade "flyby" trajectories since retrograde orbits that pass through the\nperigee altitude are not always possible while there is always a posigrade solution. The\nretrograde trajectories w r a t more study in future work. Since L1 is constantly rotating with\narn\nthe Moon, t i trajectory is iterated until L1 is reached.\nhs\nThe t i d burn is simply a circularization of the trajectory at L1 about the Earth. The velocity\nhr\nvector i s corrected to that of L1. Once the SO1 to L1 trajectory has been established, the EarthSO1 flight is iterated until the total transfer time, including the transfers from LEO to the SOI,\nand SO1 to L1, match the user\'s fight time constraint (an input value). This is done for a matrix\nof SO1penetration points, as mentioned earlier.\nThe return trajectories, which start at L1 and a s h in the specified LEO orbit within the\nspecified flight time, are calculated similarly. For instance, the "flyby" trajectory is calculated\nfirst, starting at L1 and finishing at the SO1 via a posigrade orbit calculated using the same\ngeometric simplifications described above.\nAfter the user has defined the trajectory as outbound or return, the Earth orbit altitude and\ninclination, and the total flight time, LP1 produces matrices which display the total AVs, the\nthree component AVs (described above), the "flyby" trajectory inclinations, and the "flyby"\n62\n\nazimuth angle at the SO1 for the resulting flight from Earth to Ll for a representative set of SO1\npoints. These points are defined by the user, who provides a starting longitude and latitude, and\nan increment for each. The matrix i s built with 10 longitudes forming the columns and 19\nlatitudes forming the rows.\nThe documentation describes the input required from the user to define the flight and the\ncontents of the six reports that are produced as outputs. Table 21.0-1 shows an example report.\n\nLP1 was derived from the PLANECHG program (also produced under this contract) with the\nmajor addition of the FLYBY subroutine. Therefore, the documentation for PLANECHG may\nbe used as a reference for many of the equations, variables, and conventions used in LP1 (except\nin the FLYBY routine).\n\n63\n\nTable 21.0-1, LP1 Example Report\n\n0\n*\n\nm\nw\nI\n\n0\n\n0\n\nw\nI\n\nO\n\n0\n\nm\n\n0\n\nI\n0\n0\n\nm\nI\n\n0\n\nE\n\nm\n(v\n\nI\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n(v\n\nI\n0\n\nm\n\nd\n\nI\n0\n\n0\nd\n\nI\n0\n\nm\nI\n\n0\n\n0\n\n64\n\nd\n\n.\n\nI\n\nR\nI\n3\n\nt\n\n22.0\n\nTrajectory Analysis of Transfers from LA and L5 to LLO\n\nLibration Points 4 and 5 are, respectively, locations in space 60" behind and ahead of the Moon\nin its orbit. Theoretically, there is no tendency for an object to leave these locations relative to\nthe Earth and Moon, and if displaced, the gravitational stability tends to return the object to the\nlibration point.\n\nA Full Orbit Hohmann Transfer provides the most economical method of travelling between the\nMoon and these libration points. The flight time for this transfer is 395 hours (16.5 days) for\n\'ye\nflight from LA to the Moon and from the Moon to L5 ( T p1" flights). For flights from L5 to\nthe Moon or from the Moon to LA ("Type 2" flights), the flight time is 565 hours (23.5 days).\nThe total velocity change required by the spacecraft is 757 m/s for the "Type 1" flights and 737\nm/s for "Type2" flights. For "Type 1" flights a 677 m/s velocity change is required at the Moon\nand a 80 m/s velocity change is necessary at the libration point. "Type 2" flights require 677 m/s\nat the Moon and 60 m/s at the Libration Point.\nFor short flight times Gauss\' solution to Lambert\'s Problem is sufficiently accurate to predict the\nflight time and Delta V\'s. Figure 22.0-1 shows delta V plots for these shorter transfers. But for\nflight times approaching the period of a lunar orbit, the errors in the flight time make it necessary\nto use other solution techniques such as those presented by Broucke in his analysis of the\nRestricted Three Body Problem.\nIt is estimated that to fly to the Moon by way of LA and L5 requires 758 m/s more Delta V than\nby direct transfer to LLO. Consequently, it appears unlikely that LA and W will be used as\ntransportation nodes for a lunar base.\nIf a program is to be written to perform this analysis, it is recommended that a Lambert Problem\nsolution be used as the "driver" for converging an "N"\nBody Problem integration which would\ntake into account the mass of the Moon and the perturbations of the Sun.\n\n65\n\nFigure 22.0-1, Delta Vs for Short night Times\n\n-\n\n2.8\n2.6\nA\n\n6\nV\n\ni\nQ\nb\n\n21\n\n;\nb\na\n\nr\n\n-\n\n2.4\n2.2\n\n2-\n\n1.6 1.8\n\n-\n\n1.4\n\n-\n\n1.2\n\n1-\n\n-\n\n0.8\n\n-\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n02\n\n0\n\n4-00\n\n200\n\n600\n\nTruufa tkp.<harm >\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n2s .\n2.4 2.2 2.8\n\n2 -\n\n1.6 1.4 12 .\n1.8\n\nLam# Path\n\n10.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n-\n\n0\n\n800\n\nI\n+\n\n1\nI\n\n66\n\nIibrrtion Point\n\n~~~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~~\n\n-\n\n2.\n30\n\nList of All ASTS Contract Deliverables\n\n1.\n\nAdvanced Space Transportation System (ASTS) Support Contract, Summary Final\nReport, NASA Contract No. NAS 9-17878, Eagle Rep.
