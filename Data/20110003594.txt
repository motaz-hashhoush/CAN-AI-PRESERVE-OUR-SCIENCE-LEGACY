Mea-os\n\nI\n\n.\n\n,\n\nQp1l0n.\n\nA major overhaul of the user interface, the introduction of an integrated\nprogramming language and new option\nmodules highlight Ver. 4.0 of DADiSP. ..\nBesides adopting a complete\nWindows look and feel, the overall interface scheme has gained a more streamlined look .. [W]ith the flattened hierarchy\non this upgrade, the software always\nstarts up in a worksheet; indeed, when\nloaded, the software returns to the setup\nthat was on the screen when the user\nlast exited the program. Although you\ndon\'t have to go through a hierarchy,\nthe package still maintains labbooks,\ndatasets and worksheets to provide\na simple method of organizing large\ncomplex datafiles and projects.\nAs part of the Wmdows implementation, Ver. 4.0 adds support for DDE as\na client or server either with functions\nat the command line or with Copy/\nPaste Link for the pulldown menu. It\nperforms both warm and hot DDE links\nwith either ASCII or binary datatypes ...\n\nHelp\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVer. 4.0 also gives users the ability\nto define their own operations and\nfunctions to a far greater extent than\nthe macros found in the previous version. Specifically, the upgrade marks\nthe introduction of a programming\nlanguage called SPL (series processing\nlanguage). Modeled on C, it provides\nall the expected facilities including\nuser-defined functions, looping and\niteration, conditional statements,\narray references and variables.\nVariables can be global to a session\nor local to a function.\nAn interesting feature is the hot\nvariable, which can contain real or\ncomplex numbers, strings, data series\nand matrices. A hot variable links\na formula to a variable so that when\na dependent element of a formula\nchanges, the hot variable automatically reevaluates. For example, the\nSPL code fragment\nsize:= 10\nW2: Movavg(Wl, size)\n\nFor a Free TRiAL\nCall today: 1-800-777\xc2\xb75151\nFor More Infonnatlon write In No. 541\n\nperforms a 10-point moving average on\nthe waveform in Wmdow 1 and displays\nthe results in Wmdow 2. The:= operator establishes the hot variable. You\ncan explore the effects of changing\nthe moving-average length simply by\nreassigning size := 20 so that W2 automatically updates and shows a plot\nbased on that new parameter.\nAlso improved is the package\'s\nhardcopy facility. Plot titles, legends,\nmultiple scales, selectable fonts and\na Preview mode help users produce\npublication-quality output...\n[T]wo more modules... address\nadvanced DSP and control applications.\nThe AdvDSP module performs Chirp-Z\ntransforms, N-point FFTs independent\nof series length and zoom FFTs. It\nalso handles multiple forms of PSD\nestimation (classical, autoregressive\nparametric, moving-average parametric,\nautoregressive moving-average parametric), transfer-function estimates,\nCepstrum analysis and digital interpolation. The controls module allows you\nto execute command line or pulldown\nmenus, and it addresses the design,\nanalysis and simulation of digital and\ncontinuous open- and closed-loop controllers for linear single-input/singleoutput dynamic systems. Among its\nalgorithms are those that handle PID\nloops as well as lead and lag controllers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Personal Engineering & Instrumentation News 1/95\n\nDSP\nDevelopment\nCorporation\nOne Ke ndall Square, Cambridge, MA 02139\n617-577-1133, FAX: 617-577-8211\n\n~\n\n~@n@9 lli\xc2\xaeIT@ ~c]l~lli2\nG buys the\nwed,\nt-model\nequipment\n\'re not\nanymore.\n\n,\n\n~\n\n. . .

Hartley, Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory\nUsing acoustic methods to detect leaks in\npipes, or any structure supporting standingwave propagation, runs into problems when\nthere are overwhelming levels of background\nnoise. To overcome such noise, Mr. Hartley\'s\ndetection device employs a very large scale integration (VLSI) circuit constituting the travelingwave structure of the human cochlea to derive\nspatial and spectral information in a 2-D plane,\nand calculates several representations of these\nplanes to render a 3-D stereausis representation.\nFor More Infonnatlon Write In No. 741\n\nParticle Fallout!Activity Sensor\n(u.s.

In\nOklahoma City, the new tool drew the\nattention of Federal Emergency Management Agency officials. After rescue workers in Oklahoma City used it to penetrate\nbuilding materials and rescue trapped victims, FEMA officials ordered 36 cutlers\nand 6400 power units and trained rescue\nteams in the tool\'s use. FEMA has also\nrecommended its use by all Urban Search\nand Rescue groups across the nation.\nWhat raises this cutler above its predecessor is the power unit, based on NASAdeveloped pyrotechnics. Called initiators,\nthey look like a shell, or cartridge, and are\nloaded into the tool like a shell into a gun.\nThe power unit generates hot gases that\ndrive the blade through the target, whereas\nthe earlier extractors employed expensive,\ngasoline-powered hydraulic pumps and\nhoses that were heavier and less efficient.\n\nAlthough NASA is considering using\nthe cutter for emergencies in space, its\nprincipal purpose in developing it lay in\nleveraging the cost of the power unit by\nmeans of dual-use: by making the power\nunit a commercially viable product, NASA\nand the Department of Defense can bolster their own use of the technology.\n"These initiators are the same as those\nused in mUlti-stage rockets and in explosive bolts,\' explained Carl Ray, who is a\ntechnology programs operations manager and the TRP point of contact at NASA\nHeadquarters. \'NASA and the military\nuse these initiators for different spaceborne projects, as in separating the first\nand second stages on small rockets,\nwhich must be explosively separated."\nBecause of the small number of such\nrockets, the manufacturer made only a\nlimited amount of the initiators, and so\nthe cost was high. \'But now with the\nadvent of these initiators in the commercial market," Ray said, "you\'ve expanded\nthe production and the use of these\nitems-the supply and demand goes\nup-so the price goes down.\'\nUsing only a nine-gram power unit,\nUfeshear is compact-only 22 to 26 inches long-and lightweight,\nmaking it easily transportable to remote\nareas.

It has supplied\nthese items to nearly all of NASA\'s major\ndeep space missions over the past 23\nyears. The company has demonstrated it\nintends to make a good return on the\n1.6 million dollar investment in Lifeshear,\nhalf of which was supplied by TRP. By\nJune 1995, Hi-Shear was finishing 100\nunits per month, with 1000 LS100s and\n1000 LS200s in production. The effort\nsupports seven machine shops and has\ncreated approximately 40 jobs in the Los\nAngeles area. Hi-Shear has deployed 60\ndistributors to market the tool to the\nnation\'s 40,000 fire departments. The\ncutter is listed below $2,000 (about 70\npercent less than competing rescue\nequipment) to make it affordable for\ncommunity rescue groups throughout\nthe United States. The company also\nplans to expand the tool to other markets, such as military and civilian search\nand rescue operations, mining excavations, and cable- and wire-cutting operations. "We\'ve shown it to sheriffs, highway patrol , ambulance groups, and\nthere\'s a sizeable amount of interest from\neach one of them," said Hi-Shear VicePresident Walt Smith.\n"We\'re working on a similar cutter for\npower companies," Smith added. "It\'s\nslightly more [advanced] than the unit we\nderived from the TRP program, but this\ndevice can cut a high-voltage power line.\nWe\'re talking about 84 conductors of\naluminum with 19 steel cords on the\ninside. It\'s very difficult to cut that even\nwith a hydraulic unit."\nThe February 1994 TRP award to HiShear represented the first TRP cooperative agreement with a contractor. Within\nsix months, the company had Lifeshear\nin full production, making it the first contractor to complete a TRP design and\ndevelopment program. Announced by\nPresident Clinton in March 1993, the\nTRP program is part of a $1 .7 billion\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1995\n\nDefense Reinvestment and Conversion\nAct passed by Congress. TRP projects\nare structured to reduce the cost of\nproducts made by the federal government while enhancing US competitiveness in the world market-which falls in\nline with NASA\'s mission to transfer technology to the private sector. The agency\n\nprojects the TRP with Hi-Shear will generate millions in cost-savings for federal,\nstate, and local rescue services.\nFor more information, contact Walt\nSmith, Hi-Shear Technology Corp., 24225\nGamier Street, Torrance, CA 90505-5323;\nTel: (310) 784-2101; Fax: (310) 325-5354.\n\nRescue workers in Oklahoma City learn use of the Lifeshear cutter.\n\n21\n\nResource Report\n\nJohn F. Kennedy\nSpace Center\nn 1962, NASA began acquiring property for a space center to serve as a\nlaunch operations base for the Manned\nLunar Landing program. Approximately\n140,000 acres of state-owned land were\npurchased adjacent to Cape Canaveral, FL\non Merritt Island, which became the home\nof John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC).\nKSC is the major NASA installation for\npreflight, launch, and landing operations\nand related programs supporting the\nspace shuttle. Its activities include assembly, integration, and preflight preparation\nof the shuttle and its payloads; ground\nsupport equipment design and development; tracking and data acquisition;\nlaunch operations; recovery of the shuttle\'s solid rocket boosters; landing operations; refurbishment of the orbiter; flight\noperations support; and design,\nconstruction, operation, and\nmaintenance of launch facilities.\nAlthough\nthese activities\nrequire extensive support facilities, only 5945 acres of KSC land\nhave been developed or designated for NASA operations.\nBecause Merritt Island is inhabited by endangered and potentially endangered wildlife, NASA\nentered into an agreement with\nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\nto establish the Merritt Island\nNational Wildlife Refuge within\nKSC boundaries. In addition,\nmost of the Canaveral National\nSeashore falls within KSC. An\nEnvironmental Resources Document was created to forge an\nunderstanding of conditions and\noperations at the center-especially space shuttle launches-that\nmay have an influence on the\narea\'s environment.\n\nI\n\nGetting the Message Out\nKSC performs mainly appliednot basic-research, to support\nthe space shuttle program. Bill\nSheehan, chief of KSC\'s Technology Programs and Commercialization Office, explains that this\noperations focus brings the center more in alignment with industrial activity. The KSC research\nstaff continually seeks to solve\n\n22\n\nproblems similar to those encountered in\ncommercial applications.\n"The fact that we do more applied\nresearch means that we probably are\ngoing to have a better opportunity to\nmatch up with commercial partners and\ntransfer the technology we develop,"\nSheehan said. "When we develop a technology, we\'re advancing the state of the art\nin an area that has significant commercial\napplications. Our focus on new technology\nhelps us improve the operations process."\nIn order to consolidate and expedite the\ntransfer of that technology, in 1991 KSC\nbecame the first NASA center to combine\nits technology transfer and patent offices. A\nyear-and-a-half later, technology development activities were brought in, combining\nTechnology TransferICommercialization,\n\nPatent Counsel, Dual-Use, University\nActivity, Technology Inreach/Outreach,\nSBIR, and Advance Technology Development programs in one office. This provides single-point oversight of all technology development and research functions,\nreducing conflict between projects, eliminating duplication of research efforts, and\nresu~ing in a more efficient utilization of limited funds and personnel.\nA unique aspect of technology transfer\nat KSC is the Dual-Use Program. Dualuse projects are research and development projects jointly pursued by NASA\nand industry where the results are\nplanned to have both NASA and industry\napplications. Commercial partners and\nNASA co-fund dual-use projects; NASA\nalso may provide funding for university or\nnonprofit organization projects.\nFlorida\'s Technology Research\nand\nDevelopment Authority\n(TRDA) joined with KSC in 1993 in\na technology transfer partnership\nto "co-fund projects of mutual\ninterest that have dual-use capability within the state," according\nto Sheehan. The agreement\nseeks to develop relationships\nwith local economic development\nagencies as a means to reach\nbusinesses across Florida to\ncommercialize new technologies,\nproduce new products, and bring\nthem to the marketplace. KSC\njoined with Marshall Space Flight\nCenter and Stennis Space Center\nin the Southeast Regional\nOutreach Alliance to transfer benefits of NASA expertise to industries in the southeast U.S. The\nKSC program expands on this\nconcept by utilizing Economic\nDevelopment Councils in Florida\nas ambassadors of NASA technologies, providing an open and\ncontinuous information flow\nthroughout the state.\nIn 1994, a dual-use project\ninstituted to develop the\n\nThe Space Shuttle Endeavour, weighing more than 19 million pounds\nits support and transport hardware, is loaded aboard a crawler-transporter\nfor its trip from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Pad 39A.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nSORT (Simulation and Optimization of\nRocket Trajectories) is a general-purpose three-degree-of-freedom with\nthree axis static moment balance simulation of the flight dynamiCS of an arbitrary aerospace vehicle. It has been\nused extensively by the Missions\nOperation Directorate (MOD) of the\nJohnson Space Center (JSC) in the\ndevelopment of data-initialization loads\nfor space shuttle missions as well as by\nJSC\'s Engineering Directorate for\nascent and entry trajectory optimization\nof advanced launch vehicle and spacecraft concepts. Simulations created by\nthis program have been compared rigorously to a number of other simulations\nthroughout the years to certify its overall\nfidelity. SORT numerically models vehicle subsystems such as propulsion,\nguidance, steering, and static moment\nbalance. It also contains numerous\nmodels for environmental effects including atmosphere, drag, gravity, and\nwinds for a rotating oblate planet.\nSORT has a well-designed modular\nstructure that enables its application to\na wide range of trajectory-analysis\nproblems without need for minor modifications. The program includes iteration\nlogic and discrete-event-simulation\nlogic that are completely independent of\nthe mathematical-model logic. The discrete-event-simulation logic provides\nthe user with the capability to simulate a\nlimitless number of flight profiles. With\nthe generalized targeting and optimization capability, iterations can be performed upon input parameters to minimize a cost function subject to constraints. The input parameters, cost\nfunction, and constraints are specified\nby the user. The constraints can be of\nthe equality or inequality type.\nSORT contains a math model of\naerodynamics that is completely generalized. It computes both longitudinal\nand lateral forces and moments. In\naddition to the fore-body coefficients,\nit computes the longitudinal base\neffect aerodynamic forces and\nmoments. A simplified ballistic-coefficient model is also available for analysis of ballistic entry.\n24\n\nSORT includes a math model of\npropulsion that is highly generalized but\nsimple to use. In this model, the vehicle\ncan be represented as containing as\nmany as 15 engines. Each engine can\nbe specified as either liquid- or solidfueled. A liquid-fueled engine can be\nfurther specified as being of either the\nmonopropellant or the bipropellant\ntype. The solid-fuel-engine submodel\ncan adjust the thrust, rate of flow, and\nChamber-pressure tables to compensate for the effects of ambient temperature and changes in the rate of burning. The program provides numerous\noptions for specifying angles of deflection of engines as well as a thrustdeformation model for simulations of\nhigher fidelity. Each of the engines can\nbe specified to be either throttleable or\nnonthrottleable. For static moment\ncontrol, individual engines can be specified to be controllable or noncontrollable. The degrees of controllability of\nindividual engines can also be specified\nvia gain tables.\nSORT also includes a mass-properties math model; this is a composite\nmodel that enables the user to represent the vehicle as a system that contains as many as fifteen mass subsystems. Each mass subsystem can be\nspecified to be either inert mass or propellant. For higher fidelity, a center-ofmass history is attributed to each mass\nsubsystem. The composite center of\nmass of the vehicle is computed by use\nof the parallel-axis theorem. The mass\nhistory of the vehicle is computed by\nintegrating the propellant-depletion history via one of the three available\nnumerical-integration schemes. In addition to expressing vehicle weights\ndirectly, SORT contains weight-estimation algorithms for use in analyses\ndirected toward sizing two-stage\nlaunch vehicles.\nSORT contains four stored atmosphere models as well as two generalized table-lookup models. The first generalized table-lookup algorithm provides the capability to input speed-ofsound data as well as to compute\nspeed of sound by use of the perfect-\n\ngas law. The second table-lookup algorithm provides the capability to gain\naccess to data from a binary direct\naccess file.\nThe parameter optimization logic of\nSORT is unique in that it provides the\nflexibility to solve difficult trajectorydesign problems via a multilevel\napproach. The program provides the\ncapability to break a trajectory design\ninto as many as seven levels. Each of\nthe levels can be nested either\nsequentially or recursively.

MSC-22496/97/98\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Software for Real-Time Simulation of Subsystems\nThis program provides a practical method of understanding small systems\nintegrated into larger ones.\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe Real-Time Software Simulation\nof a Small Imbedded System (SSO)\ncomputer program was developed\nfor use in Simulating anyone of a\nnumber of systems and subsystems\nof the space shuttle Columbia. These\nsystems and subsystems include the\nsystem control module (SCM), its\nground support eqUipment and test\nassembly (GSElTA), and the support\nsystem for orbiter experiments (OEX).\nThe support system consists of the\nSCM, the orbiter experiments tape\nrecorder, and the orbiter experiments\npulse-code-modulation (PCM) data\nsystem. Some of the apparatuses\nthat implement the experiments are\nthe Shuttle Entry Air Data System,\nthe Shuttle Upper Atmosphere Mass\nSpectrometer, the Shuttle Infrared\nLeeside\nTemperature\nSensing\nSystem, the Aerodynamic Coefficient\nIdentification Package, and the High\nResolution Accelerometer Package.\nSSO includes subprograms called\nthe "GSE/TA simulator" and the\n"SCM simulator." The GSEITA simulator determines the integrity of the\nSCM in a pre- and in a post- flight\nconfiguration. With the help of SSO,\nthe time spent in cross training will\nbe significantly less than that spent\nin cross training by the present\nmethod. SSO also provides a\npractical method of understanding\nsmall systems imbedded in an integrated environment like that of the\nspace shuttle Columbia without\nhaving to turn on the real GSE/TA\nand flight hardware.\n26\n\nThe SCM and GSEITA simulators\nprovide an extremely flexible means\nof controlling the OEX tape\nrecorder, the PCM system, and the\nexperiment.\nThese\nsimulators\nreceive and send commands from\nsimulated ground stations at\nKennedy Space Center, Edwards\nAir Force Base , and the Johnson\nSpace Center via a simulated multiplexer/demultiplexer\ncomputer.\nThese commands provide on/off discrete outputs to control the tape\nrecorder and as many as 31 other\nfunctions of the experimental apparatuses and the data system.\nSSO also provides for simulation of\nan analog subsystem in which one\ncan switch anyone of 32 simulated\nanalog inputs to anyone of 28 taperecorder tracks and 4 simulated\nground-support data channels. All of\nthe traditional tape-recorder controls\nare also provided, with the addition of\nseveral functions, including track\nsequence, mark, go to mark, snapshot, and log. SSO also provides the\ncapability to store sequences or commands for later execution. The commands can be sent from the simulated ground station or stored in a simulated program memory before flight.\nThe execution delays for the valid\ncommands can be modified during all\nsimulated missions, enabling adaptation to contingencies.\nThe most complex parts of SSO\ninvolve the real-time operations.\nThese operations include the command input/output (1/0), the imple-\n\nmentation of the internal clock, and\ncontrol of the OEX tape recorder, with\ncommands and arguments to be\nreceived asynchronously on an interrupt basis. The timing between command words can vary between mil liseconds and hours. Consequently,\nall operations are performed with\ninterrupts enabled because disabling\ninterrupts can cause a command to\nbe missed entirely.\nThe ultimate real-time function of\nSSO is the control of the OEX tape\nrecorder. Apart from the expected\nspeed and direction settings, SSO\nprovides a number of high-level functions that enable the recorder to be\npositioned automatically at the\nbeginning or end of the tape or at a\nposition previously set by a special\n"mark" command. SSO maintains a\ntable, by means of which a "mark"\nnumber is issued at the end of a\nrecording sequence. The simulator\nplaces a 9,000-ft (,.,2,700-m) tape\nwithin 7 in. (>=18 cm) of the marked\nposition at a later time. SSO provides\nfor reversal of the direction of travel\nof the tape, redirecting data from\nsources to unused tracks, and\nrestarting a recording sequence\nautomatically when either end of the\ntape is reached. The GSEITA simulator provides 17 self-tests that determine the health of the SCM simulator\nwhile using a switch-setting function\non the control page (an interactive\ndisplay) of the GSEITA simulator. All\ncontrol pages were designed to be\nuser-friendly.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1995\n\nImmediately gain insight from your data\nwith IOL, the pioneering software for interactive analysis and application development\nIf you analyze data from tests, experiments,\nsimulations, or images - or write applications\nfor others to use - IDL will give you clear\nresults faster.\nDramatically improve your productivity\nusing IOL for visual data analysis, rapid\nprototyping, or application development.\nNothing else provides the speed, flexibility,\nand breadth of built-in functions for access,\nmanipulation, and display of scientific and\nengineering data.\nSee results "on the fly" with integrated\n\ngraphics, image processing, mathematics,\nand statistics.

Johnson Space Center,\nHouston, Texas\nThe Failure Environment Analysis Tool (FEAl) computer program enables people to see and better understand the effects\nof failures in a system. FEAT uses digraph models to determine\nwhat will happen to a system if a set of failure events occurs\nand to identify the possible causes of a selected set of failures.\nThe user can select failures from graphical displays in either\nengineering schematic form or digraph model form, and the\neffects or potential causes of the failures will be highlighted in\ncolor on the same schematic or model graph.\nAs a design software tool, FEAT helps design reviewers\nunderstand exactly what redundancies have been built into a\nsystem and where it is necessary to protect or design out\nweak parts. A properly developed digraph can reflect how a\nsystem functionally degrades as failures accumulate. FEAT can\nalso be used in operations to help identify causes of failures\nafter they occur. Finally, FEAT is valuable both in conceptual\ndevelopment and as a training aid, inasmuch as digraphs can\nidentify weaknesses in scenarios as well as hardware.\nDigraph models for use with FEAT are generally built with the\nhelp of the Digraph Editor - a Macintosh-based application\nprogram that is distributed with FEAT. The Digraph Editor was\ndeveloped specifically with the needs of FEAT users in mind\nand offers several timesaving features. It includes an icon software toolbox of components needed in a digraph model and\na menu of functions for manipulating these components. It\nalso offers the FEAT user a convenient way to attach a formatted textual description to each digraph node. These node\ndescriptions are necessary to enable FEAT to recognize nodes\nand propagate failures within a digraph.\nThe FEAT user stores node descriptions in modeling tables\nby use of any word-processing or spreadsheet software package capable of saving data to ASCII text files. From within the\nDigraph Editor, the user can then interactively attach a properly formatted textual description to each node in a digraph.\nOnce descriptions are attached to them, a selected set of\nnodes can be saved as a library file that represents a generic\ndigraph structure for a class of components.

This subprogram implements a multistep algorithm that builds a\nseries of phantom bridges, or gates, that\nenable accurate bidirectional processing\nof digraphs. In the cases of extremely\nlarge models, this preprocessing can\nconsume substantial time, but once preprocessing is complete, queries can be\nanswered and displayed within seconds.\nA UNIX X-Windows port of version 3.5 of\nFEAT, called "XFEAT," is also available,\nand can speed the processing of digraph\nmodels. These models are created on a\nMacintosh computer. FEAT v3.6, which is\navailable for the Macintosh only, provides\nsome report -generation capabilities that\nare not available in XFEAT.\nFor very large integrated systems,\nFEAT can reduce the costs of evaluation of designs, training , and capturing\nknowledge. Because it is possible to\nload multiple digraphs and schematics\n\ninto FEAT, modelers can use FEAT to\norganize models of systems into smaller, more focused digraphs. Typically,\neach digraph file represents only a portion of a larger failure scenario. FEAT\ncombines these files and digraphs to\nform a continuous mathematical model\nof the failure logic of a system .\nInasmuch as multiple digraphs can be\ncumbersome to use, FEAT ties propagation results to schematic drawings\nproduced by use of MacDraw " (version\n1.1v2 or later) or Mac Draw Pro. This\nmakes it easier to identify single- and\ndouble-point failures that may have to\ncross several system boundaries and\nmultiple engineering diSCiplines before\ncreating a hazardous condition .\nFEAT v3.6 for the Macintosh computer\nis written in C language by use of\nMacintosh Programmer\'s Workshop C\nv3.2. It requires at least a Mac II-series\ncomputer running System 7 or System\n6.0.8 and 32-Bit QuickDraw. It also\nrequires a math coprocessor or\ncoprocessor emulator and a color monitor (or one with 256-gray-scale capability). A minimum of 4MB of free randomaccess memory (RAM) is highly recommended. The UNIX version of FEAT\n\nincludes both FEAT v3 .6 for the\nMacintosh and XFEAT. XFEAT is written\nin C language for Sun-series workstations running SunOS, SGI workstations\nrunning IRIX, DECstations running\nULTRIX, and Intergraph workstations\nrunning CLIX version 6. It requires the\nMIT X Window System, Version 11 ,\nRevision 4, with OSF/Motif 1.1.3, and\n16MB of RAM.\nThe standard medium for distribution\nof FEAT 3.6 (Macintosh version) is a set\nof three 3.5-in.

MSC-22446\n\ntj Program Aids Visualization of Data\nThis program eliminates the need for custom graphical-display software\nfor application programs.\nLewis Research Center; Cleveland, Ohio\nThe Living Color Frame System\n(LCFS) computer program was developed to solve some of the problems\nthat arise in connection with the generation of real -time graphical displays of\nnumerical data and of the statuses of\nsystems. The need for a program like\nLCFS arises because computer graphics are often applied for better understanding and interpretation of data\nunder observation and these graphics\nbecome more complicated when\nanimation is required during run time, as\nin many typical modern artificial-intelligence and expert systems.\nLCFS includes a software tool for the\ngeneration and management of graphics, provides a user-friendly graphical\ninterface with mouse-driven controls,\nand provides extensive on-line instructions. Regarded as a system, LCFS\nconsists of a number of modules that\ncan be used to create graphics\nscreens (frames), receive and record\ndata from a hardware or software\nsource, and update screen information\nto reflect changes in incoming data.\n30\n\nThe modules also make it possible for\nthe graphics screens to be logically\nlinked (through frame objects), and\nthen dynamically recalled (unique\nobject-oriented zooming technique) for\ndisplay in real time by use of mouse\ncommands. Run-time software for the\ninclusion of custom video and sound\neffects on these frames is also provided (complete demonstration programs). Support for such functions as\ndisplay of monitored data, manipulation of graphical images, and sounding\nof the computer buzzer is included.\nIn some applications, the generated\ngraphical frames can be visual aids for\nmanaging systems. LCFS is suitable\nfor integration into a wide range of\nreal -time application programs in\nwhich graphical displays are needed.\nFor example, for purposes of monitoring, diagnosis, and/ or control, circuit\nor system diagrams can be brought to\nlife by use of designated video colors\nand intensities to symbolize the status\n(real-time feedback from sensors, calculated values, etc.) of systems, sub-\n\nsystems, and components of hardware. LCFS eliminates the need for\ncustom programming of computer\ngraphics, enabling software developers to focus on the functionalities of\ntheir application programs.\nLCFS is written in Turbo C++ for IBM\nPC-series and compatible computers\nrunning MS-DOS v3.3 or later. The program requires at least 88K of randor\'naccess memory, a color display (CGA,\nEGA, VGA) , and a two-button mouse.\nThe distribution medium includes an\nelectronic copy of the documentation\nin WordPerfect format, a sample executable code, and a demonstration file.\nThe standard medium for distribution\nof LCFS is a 3.5-in.

Grid\nand simulation data files in PLOT3D format are required for\ninput. This program is able to unwrap the volumetric data cone\nassociated with a centrifugal compressor and display results in\neasy-to-understand two- or three-dimensional plots. IDDS\nprovides the majority of the visualization and analysis capability for the Integrated Computational Fluid Dynamics and\nExperiment (ICE) system. In the ICE computing environment,\nIDDS can be invoked from any subsystem, or it can be used\nas a stand-alone package of display software.\nIDDS offers five different plotting styles: contour, vector,\nshaded, x-y, and carpet. All of these styles are available for\nboth two-dimensional and three-dimensional data. For threedimensional plotting, IDDS automatically combines the i, j, k\nindices and predetermines views. These views are cross-channel, blade-to-blade, and meridional. The cross-channel view is\nformed by combining all i and j indices, and is intended to\nshow secondary flow characteristics . A blade-to-blade view is\ndeveloped by combining all i and k indices, and is intended to\nshow streamwise flow characteristics on a plane parallel to the\nhub from inlet to outlet. The meridional view is constructed by\ncombining all j and k indices. This view is also intended to\nshow streamwise characteristics, but in a plane parallel to a\nblade surface from inlet to outlet.\nIDDS enables the user to select up to four windows and\nplots to be displayed on the computer video screen. A unique\nfile can be associated with each window for comparison of\nplotted data. Options for customization of plots include: the\nvariable for display, orientations of slices through the data, type\nof plot, numerical and color ranges for color bars, contour levels, and vector levels.\nGeometric coordinates are taken directly from a grid file\nspecified by the user. IDDS enables the user to display the\ngeometry, orient it as desired, and then overlay the desired plot\non top of the geometry. After selection of the desired plot(s)\nand geometry, the display is built. The user has the option to\ndisplay the grid, the plot, and/or the geometry individually or in\nany combination . After the picture is rendered, the user can\nrotate, translate, or zoom on the display.\nIDDS is written in C language for Silicon Graphics IRIS- and\nIndigo-series workstations running IRIX. IDDS requires a minimum of 16MB of random-access memory and a display capable of 24-bit Z-buffering . A sample executable code is included. The input file format used by IDDS is that of PLOT3D\n(COSMIC item ARC-127B2) . The creation of these input files is\nfully detailed in the documentation.

In this technique, the\nscan is effected by one of the relatively\nsmall beam-waveguide reflectors or mirrors (see figure) that couple signals\nbetween the antenna and its distant transmitting and/or receMng electronic circuits.\nIn the original application, the antenna is\none of the Deep Space Network (DSN)\nantennas, with a paraboloidal reflector 34\nm in diameter, operating at a frequency of\n32 GHz. The required half-cone angle for\nscanning at 0.1 dB below the beam peak\ngain is 0.0016\xc2\xb0. It would be very difficult to\nachieve such a fine conical scan by tilting\nthe entire massive antenna structure as in\nprevious\nDSN\nconscan\nsystems.\nHowever, it is relatively easy to tilt one of\nthe far smaller beam-waveguide mirrors.\nArry of the beam-waveguide mirrors could\nbe used for this purpose. The one dlosen in\nthe original application is located at the elevation axis of the antenna. A geometric analysis\nshows that the required 0.0016\xc2\xb0 conical scan\nof the beam peak of the antenna can be\nachieved by a 0.0375\xc2\xb0 conical scan of this\nmirror, labeled "M1" in the figure.\nNote that this scan is much larger than\nis the required scan of the beam peak;\nthis indicates that the aim of the antenna\nis relatively insensitive to an error in the tilt\n\nFixed\nParaboloidal\nReflector\n\nOne of the Flat Mirrors Is Tilted through a small angle, eM, to obtain an even smaller beampeak deviation, e, of the line of sight of the antenna. Although M1 is tilted in this example, any\nof the other mirrors M2 through M6 could be tilted instead.\n\nof this mirror, and consequently the scanning mechanism can be less precise than\nthat needed for equivalent scanning of the\nentire antenna. The loss of beam peak\ngain directly attributable to the conical\nscan of this mirror is only about 0.01 dB.\n\nThis work was done by Watt Veruttipong\nand Dan A.

A\nmechanical controller of the type in question is designed to maintain the temperature of a heater at a preset value by turning power fully on or fully off when the\ntemperature falls below or rises above\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1995\n\nthat value, respectively. This results in an\noscillating on/off mode of operation characterized by excessive consumption of\nenergy and by frequent failures caused\nby (1) overpowering of the heater, (2)\nsurging of power to the heater, (3) excessive temperature overshoot, (4) excessive\non/off cycling of the temperature controller, (5) excessive expansion and contraction of the heater element, and (6)\n\nthermal shock to the heater element.\nIn contrast, an electronic proportional\ncontroller supplies only the power needed to maintain the temperature of the\nheater nearly constant at the preset\nvalue, eliminating the large cyclic stresses\nof on/off operation (see figure). The result\nis increased effiCiency and reduction of the\nincidence of failures.

To recapitulate: A reflector of\nthis type is constructed as a unitary sandwich panel with a rigid dielectric core and\nfrequency-selective front and back surfaces, which are implemented as periodic arrays of double-square-Ioop electrically conductive patches on thin dielectric\nsheets. The front surface is highly reflective in the K. band and highly transmissive\nin the S, X, and Ku bands; the back surface is highly reflective in the X band and\nhighly transmissive in the Sand Ku bands\n(see Figure 1). (In another design called\n"integrated," only one dielectric face\nsheet supports an array of double-loop\n\nconductive elements that satisfies the\nbasic frequency-selective transmission\nand reflection requirement. The add-on\ndesign was selected over the integrated\ndesign on the basis of manufacturing and\nmechanical considerations.)\nThe prototype dichroic reflectors that\nwere built and tested previously were flat\napproximations of the required curved\nones. Figure 2 is a flow diagram of the\nprocess for fabrication of a curved one\nwith a dielectric honeycomb core. The\nunique aspect of this process is that the\nconductive loop elements are formed\nphotolithographically on the face sheets\nby direct laser imaging.\nThis work was done by Gregory S.\nHickey and Te-Kao Wu of Caltech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, write in 137 on\nthe TSP Request Card.

The basic concept of this\nprocessor was described in "Optical-Input,\nOptical-Output Morphological Processor"\n(NPO-18174), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 16,\nNo. 11 (November 1992), page 52.\nThis processor performs binary operations on binary (black and white) images.\nEach processing element corresponds to\none picture element of an image and is\nlocated at that picture element. Each processing element includes an input-plane\nphotodetector in the form of a parasitic\nphototransistor that is part of a processing circuit (see figure). The output of each\nprocessing circuit would be used to modulate one picture element in an outputplane liquid-crystal display device, which\nhad not yet been built when the information for this article was reported.\n\nThis processor is intended to implement morphological processing algorithms that transform an image into a set\nof features suitable for high-level processing; e.g., recognition. Morphological\nprocessing has been shown to be capable of removing noise and clutter and of\nediting an image on the basis of the sizes\nand shapes of objects of interest.\nMorphological operations do not\ninvolve global communication of image\ndata among all picture elements; only\nlocal data connections between adjacent picture elements are needed. Consequently, rapid morphological processing is readily implementable in a parallel\noptoelectronic architecture like that of\nthis processor. In contrast, morphological image-processing algorithms, when\nexecuted on general-purpose computers, are extremely computationally intensive, and it is, therefore, difficult to execute them at video frame rates.\nThe processor includes a control circuit\nthat generates clock and control strobe\n\nsignals for the processing elements in the\narray on the basis of the high-level morphological instructions to be executed. A\n4-bit control word is fed into the control\ncircuit to specify the operations to be performed . This control word is decoded to\nprovide the control signals needed for\neach operation. Each time a command\nstrobe signal is activated, the control\nword selects one of the morphological\noperations, which is executed by all of\nthe morphological processors in parallel.\nThe prototype morphological processor was fabricated in complementary\nmetal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS)\nVLSI circuitry, using 2-i..Jm design rules.\nThe prototype circuit chip measures 1.2\nby 1.2 mm and contains an 8 by 8 array\nof processing elements. Its digital circuitry operates at a rate of 40 MHz, which is\nsufficient for real-time processing of\nimages at a video frame rate of 1 kHz.\nThis work was done by Wai-Chi\nFang, Timothy Shaw, and Jeffrey Yu of\nCa/tech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\n\nControl and\n\n~:~::~\nProcessing\nCircuitry\n\n-\n\ni-4\'-+--+--}\n-\n\n-\n\n}\n\nL----H~\n\nPhotodetector\n\nInput from\nNeighboring\nProcessing\nElements\nOutput to\nNeighboring\nProcessing\nElements\n\nThreshold\nLevel\nDETAIL OF HIGHLIGHTED AREA\n\nThe VLSI Focal-Plane Array of optoelectronic input and output devices and processing circuits combines the high throughput rate of a twodimensional fine-grained array of simultaneous (parallel) processing elements with the programmability of the digital circuitry within each processing element.\n\n40\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1995\n\nTemperature &V\noHage M\neasurement\nThe 19" rack-mountable MultiScanll200\xe2\x84\xa2\ntemperature and voltage measurement\ninstrument offers both channel-to-channel\nisolation and high accuracy.

Such an enclosure is\nneeded because (1) the temperatures of\nthe transducers in the sensors must be\nmaintained at a specified set point to\nensure proper operation and calibration\nand (2) the sensors are sometimes\nused to measure pressure in hostile\nenvironments (wind tunnels in the original application) that are hotter or colder\nthan the set point. Thus, depending on\nthe temperature of the pressure-measurement environment, the thermoelectric devices in the enclosure are used to\nheat or cool the transducers to keep\nthem at the set point.\nThe enclosure (see figure) includes\nan aluminum box with walls 0.125 in.\n(3.2 mm) thick, encased in insulating\nfoam 1 in. (25 mm) thick. The top of the\nenclosure is removable to provide\naccess to the inside. The temperature\nin the sensor assembly is monitored,\nfor the purpose of control, by use of a\nresistance temperature device (RTD).\nSingle-stage\nthermoelectric\nheat\npumps are thermally bonded and\nsandwiched between the underside of\nthe aluminum box and a heat-sink\nplate. The number of thermoelectric\ndevices used is directly related to the\nnumber of electronically scanned pressure-sensor modules to be kept at a\ncontrolled temperature.\nThe temperature in the box is controlled by varying the currents supplied\nto the thermoelectric devices in\nresponse to the reading of the RTD:\nThe control circuit is an autotune proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative\n(PID) dual-linear-output temperature\ncontroller (one output for heating and\none for cooling); the outputs of the\ncontrol circuit are fed to a variable\n400-W bipolar dc power supply that,\nin turn, feeds power to the thermoelectric devices.\nThe prototype enclosure was tested\nin a laboratory in two phases. In the\n\n46\n\nfirst-phase tests, a dummy electrical\nheater was used as a thermal load,\ninstead of an assembly of pressure\nsensors. The second-phase tests were\nperformed with an operational pressure-sensor assembly installed. In\nthese tests, the enclosure was tested\nin an environmental test chamber in\nwhich the temperature was varied from\n-185 to 60\xc2\xb0C (-301 to 140 oF), while\nthe temperature of the pressure sen-\n\ntubing and associated control wiring\nwere bundled and passed through a\nslotted aluminum block to the exterior\nof the box.\nBoth the laboratory and tunnel tests\nshowed that the temperature in the\npressure sensors can be maintained\nwithin \xc2\xb10.5 \xc2\xb0C (\xc2\xb1O.9 oF) of any set\npOint in the set-point range mentioned\nabove (this range of 10 to 30\xc2\xb0C was\nselected to optimize both the heating\n\nAluminum Box\n\nElectrical Connector for\nPressure sensors--..........\n\n32 Pressure Tubes\n\nArray of 32 Electronically\nScanned Pressure Sensors\n\nThe Thermoelectrically Cooled or Heated Enclosure maintains the pressure sensors within\n\xc2\xb1O.5 \xc2\xb0C of a preset temperature in the presence of wide variations in the ambient temperature.\n\nsors was held at various set points\nbetween 10 and 30\xc2\xb0C (between 50\nand 86 oF), and the pressure ranged up\nto 93 kPa (9 atm).\nThe prototype enclosure was also\ntested in the National Transonic\nFacility wind tunnel at the same temperatures and pressures.

Actuators Compensate for Variations in the length of the interferometric optical path.\n\nThe prototype apparatus shown\nschematically in Rgure 1 was constructed\nto test the feasibility of a feedback control concept for stabilization of the length\nof the optical path between two pOints\non a vibrating flexible structure. In the\noriginal intended application, the structure\nwould be a truss that has dimensions of\nthe order of meters and that supports\noptical components of a stellar interferometer. The basic requirement upon the\nfeedback control system is to reduce\noptical-path-Iength disturbances to the\nnanometer level to maintain the precision\nneeded for stellar interferometry. This\nfeedback control concept may also prove\napplicable to other large optical instruments in which it is required to maintain\nprecise path lengths without having to use\nmassive, expensive structures to obtain\nthe rigidity necessary for precision.\nSome aspects of the present feedback control concept and the prototype\napparatus were described in "Controllable\nOptical Delay Line for Stellar Interferometry" (NPO-18686), Laser Tech\nBriefs, Vol. 1, No. 1 (September, 1993),\npage 44 and "Test Bed for Control of\nOptical-Path Lengths" (NPO-18487),\nLaser Tech Briefs, Vol. 2, No.1 (\\\'Vinter,\n1994), page 61. In the prototype apparatus, the optical path lies within an interferometer that includes stationary interferometric optical components on an optical\nbench, plus a retroreflective assembly of\noptical components on a trolley attached\nto the free upper end of a tower-like cantilevered flexible structure. The interferometric components on the optical bench\nmeasure changes in the length of the optical path, thus providing a feedback signal.\nThe trolley contains two optical-\n\n48\n\npath-length actuators; a voice-coil actuator connected between the trolley and\nthe structure, and a piezoelectric actuator that moves a small, flat secondary\nmirror within the trolley. The piezoelectric\nactuator is used to compensate for\nsmall, high-frequency vibrations. The\nvoice-coil actuator is used to compensate for low-frequency vibrations and\nkeep the trolley positioned so that the\ndesired constant optical-path length lies\nwithin the small dynamic range of the\npiezoelectric actuator. The dynamic\nresponse of the optical path length to\nthe piezoelectric-actuator input is not\naffected significantly by the dynamics of\nthe flexible structure because the mass\nof the secondary mirror is small and the\npiezoelectric-actuator stack is balanced\nfor momentum compensation.\nThe input to the piezoelectric actuator\nis generated by processing the opticalpath-length feedback signal through a\ndigitally synthesized filter that implements\na gain and frequency response represented by transfer function K,(s) (where s\ndenotes the Laplace-transform complex\n\nfrequency). The input to the voice-coil\nactuator is generated by processing the\npiezoelectric actuator input through a\nsecond filter of transfer function K2(S) (see\nFigure 2). Unlike in the design of many\ncontrol systems, the transfer functions\nare not designed from a parametric\nmodel of the dynamics of the structure\nand actuators: instead, they are synthesized from measurements of the frequency responses of the optical path length to\nvoice-coil-actuator and piezoelectricactuator inputs. The objective in designing K,(s) and K2(s) is to make the closedloop system stable and make the total\nloop gain as large as possible over the\nlargest achievable frequency range.\nInitial experiments on the prototype\nshowed that the system can reduce, to the\nlevel of tens of nanometers, the path-length\ndisturbances caused by forced vibrations\nat levels of tens to hundreds of microns.\nThis work was done by John T.

Replacement is necessary because CFC\'s and HCFC\'s have\nbeen found to contribute to depletion of\nozone from the upper atmosphere, and\nthe manufacture and use of them are\nrequired by law to be phased out in the\nnear future.\nThe two fluorinated ethers in question\ndo not have ozone-depletion potential\nand can be used in existing foam -producing equipment, which is designed to\nhandle liquid blowing agents that are soluble in the chemical ingredients that are\nmixed to make the foam. These fluorinated ethers (see table) are CH 3CH 20CHF2\n(called "E245") and CF3CH 20CH 3 (called\n"E263"). They are compatible with both\nthe isocyanate and the polyol ingredients\nof polyurethane foams. E245 is relatively\nexpensive and, when released into the\natmosphere, has a characteristic lifetime\nof about 6 years. E263 is relatively inexpensive and has an atmospheric lifetime\nof about 2 months. In other respects,\ntheir properties are similar.\nThe gelling times and densities of\npolyurethane foams made with these\nfluorinated ethers are similar to those\nmade with CFC-11 and HCFC-141 b .\nFurthermore, the foams made with the\nfluorinated ethers have superior cellular structures with finer cells .

Fluorinated ethers may also prove\nuseful as replacements for CFC refrigerants and solvents.\nInitially, there was concern that the two\nfluorinated ethers would form peroxides\nupon aging and exposure to air, even\nthough their long atmospheric lifetimes\nwould seem to preclude this (the longchain ethers that typically form peroxides\nhave lifetimes measured in hours). Attempts to form peroxides by oxygenating\n\nthe materials yielded negative results;\nthat is, no peroxides were detected.\nPreliminary tests of toxicity showed that\nthese fluorinated ethers should be handled similarly to other ethers-with adequate ventilation, taking account of their\nanesthetic effects. Other toxic effects,\nlike carcinogeniCity (if any), have not yet\nbeen investigated.\nThis work was done by Elana Blevins\nand Jon B.

It also leaves very little nonvolatile\nresidue, exhibits low toxicity, and evaporates about as quickly as trichlorotrifluoroethane does.\nLike trichlorotrifluoroethane, liquid n-\n\nbutane can be handled easily while wearing normal laboratory attire. It is easily\nextractable in that it boils at a temperature of -0.5 \xc2\xb0C. It also exhibits a high\ndegree of filterability, so that it can easily\nbe filtered to obtain a count of particles\nsuspended in it.\nThis work was done by Paul H.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nBoxes made of porous, hydrophobic\npolymers have been developed to contain the aqueous potassium hydroxide\nelectrolyte solutions of zinc/air batteries\nwhile allowing air to diffuse in as needed\nfor operation. Boxes like these could\nalso be used on other types of batteries\nfor in-cabin use in which the electrolytes\nare aqueous and from which gases generated during operation must be vented\nwithout allowing the electrolytes to leak\nout. Examples include silver/zinc, alkaline/manganese, nickeVcadmium, nickel/ metal hydride, and lead/acid batteries, all of which emit hydrogen.\nThe predecessors to the present polytetrafluoroethylene boxes were made of\nnonporous polycarbonate and featured\nvent holes covered with gas-permeable,\n\nliquid-impermeable caps. These caps\nwere made of polymeric laminates that\nincluded porous polytetrafluoroethylene\nfilms , and they were bonded adhesively\nto the boxes. Because of the nature of\nthe materials used , it was difficult and\noften impossible to make leak-t ight\nadhesive bonds. As a result, the boxes\nwere susceptible to leakage of electrolyte at the vent holes.\nA box of the present type is molded in\ntwo pieces: one piece comprises the bottom and sides; the other piece is the top.\nBoth pieces are made from a hydrophobic\nfluorinated polymeric powder, e.g. ,\npoly(tetrafluoroethylene) or poly(vinylidene\nfluoride) powder. The powder is sintered,\nrather than melted as in injection molding,\nto give the molded pieces a porous\n\nmicrostructure similar to that of the polystyrene foam used in some coffee cups.\nThe pores allow gases to pass through,\nwhile the hydrophobicity prevents the\naqueous electrolyte from passing through.\nThe two pieces of the box are bonded\nadhesively by use of an epoxy cement.\nEpoxies do not ordinarily adhere to\nsmooth poly(tetrafluoroethylene) surfaces, but in this case, the surface is not\nsmooth : The epoxy readily forms a bond\nto the microscopically rough surface of\nthe porous box material.\nThis work was done by Bobby J.\nBragg of Johnson Space Center and\nJohn E. Casey, Jr. , of Lockheed\nEngineering and Sciences Co. For fur-\n\nther information, write in 83 on the TSP\nRequest Card. MSC-22389\n\nTemporally and Thermally Stable Iron/Nickel Alloy\nHigh-purity processing imparts an unusual combination of properties .\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA specially prepared version of a commercial low-thermal-expansion iron/nickel\nalloy exhibits unprecedented thermal and\ntemporal dimensional stability. Commonly\ndesignated by its trade name, Invar 36,\nthis alloy has a nominal compoSition of 64\npercent iron and 36 percent nickel. The\nspecial preparation consists of a highpurity powder-metallurgy process followed by a heat treatment. The carbon\ncontent of the specially prepared alloy is\n< 0.01 percent; the content of other\nimpurities is also < 0.01 percent. The high\npurity of the alloy is essential for its unusual combination of properties.\nThe coefficient of thermal expansion\n(CTE) of a typical batch of this alloy is\nconsiderably less than 1 x W \xc2\xb7<;/oC (see\nfigure) , and the rate of relative temporal\nchange in any of its linear dimensions\n\n52\n\n(essentially, a slow shrinkage) is less than\n10-6/year.

The algorithms apply genetically inspired operators to populations of\npotential solutions in an iterative fashion,\ncreating new populations while searching\nfor an optimal or nearly optimal solution to\nthe problem at hand.\nSPLICER provides the underlying software framework and structure for building\na genetic-algorithm application program.\nSPLICER has a modular architecture that\nincludes a genetic-algorithm kernel, interchangeable representation libraries, fitness modules and user-interface libraries,\nand well-defined interfaces among these\ncomponents. The architecture supports\nportability, flexibility, and extensibility.\nSPLICER comes with all source code and\nseveral examples. For instance, a "traveling salesperson" example searches for\nthe minimum distance through a number\nof cities, viSiting each city only once.\nStand-alone SPLICER application pro54\n\ngrams can be used without any programming knowledge. However, to utilize\nSPLICER fully within new problem\ndomains, familiarity with C-Ianguage programming is essential.\nThe genetic-algorithm (GA) kernel in\nSPLICER was developed independent of\nrepresentation (i.e., problem-encoding),\nfitness-function , or user-interface type.\nThe GA kernel comprises all functions\nnecessary for the manipulation of populations. These functions include the creation\nof populations and members thereof, the\niterative population model, frtness scaling,\nparent selection and sampling, and the\ngeneration of population statistics. In\naddition, miscellaneous functions are\nincluded in the kernel (e.g., random-number generators). Different problem-encoding schemes and functions are defined\nand stored in interchangeable representation libraries. This enables the use of the\nGA kernel with any representation\nscheme. SPLICER provides representation libraries for binary strings and for permutations. These libraries contain functions for the definition, creation, and\ndecoding of genetiC strings, as well as\nmultiple crossover and mutation operators. Furthenmore, SPLICER defines the\nappropriate interfaces to enable users to\ncreate new representation libraries.\nFitness modules are the only components of the SPLICER system that a user\nneeds to create or alter to solve a particular problem . Fitness functions are\ndefined and stored in interchangeable fitness modules, which must be created by\nuse of C language. Within a fitness module, a user can create a fitness (or scoring) function, set the initial values for various SPLICER control parameters (e.g.,\nsize of a population). create a function\nthat graphically displays the best solutions as they are found, and provide\ndescriptive infonmation about the problem. SPLICER comes with several example fitness modules, while the process of\ndeveloping a fitness module is fully discussed in the accompanying documenta-\n\nCOSMIC\xc2\xb7 Timothy L Peacock, Director\nPhone (706) 542-3265;\nFAX (706) 542-4807\nThe University of Georgia,\n382 East Broad Street,\nAthens, Georgia 30602\n\ntion.

ACARA schedules replacement of\ncomponents to optimize the performance\nof the system. The scheduling can be\nmade to comply with any constraints on\nthe production of components, capacities\nof resupply vehicles, spares kept on site,\ncrews, and/or equipment.\nACARA is capable of many types of\nanalyses and trade studies because of its\nintegrated approach. It characterizes the\nperformance of a system in terms of both\nstate availability and equivalent availability\n(a weighted average of state availability). It\ncan determine the probability of exceeding a capacity state to assess reliability\nand probability of loss of load. It can also\nevaluate the effect of the constraints\nupon resources on the availability of the\nsystem and its life-cycle cost.\nACARA interprets the results of a simulation and displays tables and charts for (1)\nperformance; i.e., availability and reliability\nof capacity states, (2) frequency of failure\nand repair, (3) life-cycle cost, including hardware, transportation, and maintenance,\nand (4) usage of available resources,\nincluding mass, volume, and person-hours\nspent on maintenance. ACARA incorporates an easy-to-use, menu-driven interface with full screen data entry. It provides\na file-management system to store and\nretrieve sets of input and output data for\nsystem-simulation scenarios.\nACARA is written in APL2, using the\nAPL2 interpreter, for IBM PC-compatible\ncomputers running MS-DOS. Hardware\nrequirements for the APL2 system include\n640K of random-access memory, 2 Mb\nof extended memory, and an 80386 or\n80486 processor with an 80 x 87 math\ncoprocessor. A dot-matrix printer is necessary for printing a graph from a results\ntable. An MS-DOS executable code is\nalso provided on the distribution medium\nand does not require extended memory,\nan 80386, or a math coprocessor. It can\nbe used to model systems of limited size.\nThe executable code contains licensed\nmaterial from the APL2 for the IBM PC\nproduct, which is program property of\nIBM: Copyright IBM Corporation 1988 all rights reserved. It is distributed with\npermission of IBM. The standard distribution medium for this program is a set of\nthree 5.25-in. (13.34-cm), 360K MSDOS-format diskettes.

LEW-15713\n\n56\n\no\n\nMechanics\n\nEstimating Noise Levels\nin an Enclosed Space\nContributions of multiple\npieces of equipment at\nvarious locations and times\nare taken into account.\nThe GEGS Acoustic Analysis Program\n(GMP) was developed to compute the\ncomposite profile of noise in the\nSpacelab module on the basis of data on\nnoise produced by equipment, data on\nlocations of equipment, and equipmentoperating schedules. The impetus for the\ndevelopment of GMP was provided by\nthe noise that was generated in the\nSpacelab Module during the SLS-1 mission because of the concurrent operation\nof many pieces of experimental and subsystem equipment. The noise produced\nstress in the crew members. Although\nGMP was originally intended specifically\nto help compute the noise in Spacelab, it\nis also applicable to any region in which\nthere are multiple sources of noise.\nInasmuch as the composite profile of\nnoise in the Spacelab module is a function of locations of equipment, times of\nturning equipment on and off, and reverberation characteristics of the enclosure\nthat contains the equipment, a large\nnumber of data are generated in an\nanalysis directed toward the generation\nof such a profile. Therefore, a graphicalinterface subprogram was incorporated\ninto GMP to display the spatial distribution of the noise profile in a three-dimensional plot. The user can specify whether\nGMP is to consider the direct sound\nfield only, the reverberant sound field\nonly, or both the direct and reverberant\nsound fields. GMP is capable of using\neither the metric or the English system of\nmeasurement units.\nGMP is written in FORTRAN 77. It\nwas originally developed for use on DEC\nVAX-series cornputers running VMS, but\nhas also been successfully implemented\non UNIX computers, including Sun computers running SunOS and DECstationseries computers running DEC RISC\nULTRIX. The program requires 5MB of\nrandom-access memory for execution.\nBecause this program puts out files in\nPostScript format, a means of viewing or\nprinting PostScript files is necessary. The\nstandard medium for distribution of\nGMP is a 0.25-in. (6.35-mm) streamingmagnetic-tape cartridge (Sun QIC-24) in\nUNIX tar format. Alternate distribution\n\nmedia and formats are available upon\nrequest.

The program has been used extensively in engineering and quality analyses.\nTF is menu-driven and implements\nfour calculation routines: (1) one-sided\ntolerance-factor calculation ; (2) twosided tolerance-factor calculation; (3)\nnoncentral t probability calculation; and\n(4) noncentral t percentage pOint calculation. The unique approach to the noncentral t routines is very computationally\nefficient. The use of the program compares favorably with the use of standard\nreference tables in terms of convenience,\nflexibility, and accuracy of results.\nTF is written in Microsoft QuickBasic\nv2.0, and both an executable and a\nsource code are included in the package.\nThe only requirement for running the\nincluded executable code is an IBM PC*compatible computer with an 80 x 87\nmath coprocessor.

The Crack in the Ligament is typical of fatigue cracks that develop as a result\nof large cyclic loads applied to the bolthole.\n\nthe flange circumference experiences\n100 or more stress strain cycles of tension and compression. The holes in the\nflange generate large stress concentrations (up to 3.6 times the nominal stress)\nwhich gives rise to fatigue cracks initiating in the ligament. The ligament is the\nnarrow part of the flange above the bolt\nholes (see Figure 1). When installed, the\nfatigue-arrestor bolts retard the fatigue\nwhen the engine is operated in this\nunrestrained condition.\nThese fatigue-arrestor bolts use\ninterference fit to retard fatigue accumulation . Similar interference fit assemblies have been used in industry to\nretard elastic fatigue in holes (where the\nalternating stresses are generally less\nthan 50% the yield strength of the\nmaterial). During an unrestrained\nengine start, the unrestrained hole\nexperiences peak strains greater than\nthree times the yield strength of the\nmaterial. The bolt has a smooth shank\nmade for an interference fit in the bolthole. The amount of the interference fit\n[the diameter of the bolt shank exceeds\nthe 0.250-in. (6.35-mm) diameter of the\nbolthole by 0.0011 to 0.0020 in. (0.028\nto 0.051 mm)] has been optimized by\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1995\n\nexperiments. The bolt is cooled in liquid\nnitrogen to shrink it, then quickly\npressed into place in the bolthole before\nit warms up and expands to full size.\nThe bolt is also held in the hole by a selflocking nut (see Figure 2).\nThe interference fit places the surrounding flange material under a compressive stress. This reduces the range\nof strains experienced by the ligament\nand thereby extends the low cycle\nfatigue life of the ligament. The concentrations of stress that would ordinarily\noccur around a hole in a plate are virtually eliminated for compressive loads,\nand are believed to be reduced for tensile loads as well. The interference fit\ncauses the surrounding material to\nbehave as though no hole exists until\nthe tensile stress exceeds the compressive stress at the interface between the\nbolt and the hole.\nThe increase in fatigue life afforded by\nthe fatigue-arrestor bolts was demonstrated by stress cycling of identical\nspecimens with and without fatiguearrestor bolts installed in the holes. Of\ntwelve specimens tested with fatiguearrestor bolts, the lives increased by\nfactors ranging from 8.9 to more than\n90. The wide variation in these\nobserved values is attributed to the difficulty of reproducing identical interference fits and to the use of different\nstrain ranges.\nThis work was done by Joseph W\nOnstott, Mark Gilster, Sergio Rodriguez,\nJohn E.

A RUM\nactuator is a proposed device that would\nbe mounted on a gimbaled, pivoted, or\nfreely floating instrument and used to\nmake the instrument oscillate about one\nor more axes. A RUM actuator would\ninclude one or more (typically, two) unbalanced masses (e.g., lump masses on\narms) for each axis about which oscillation is desired. The unbalanced masses\nwould be driven to rotate at constant\nangular velocity to produce oscillating\ncentrifugal forces, which, in tum, would\nexert cyclic torques that make the instrument oscillate about the desired axis.\nRUM actuators could be used in both terrestrial and spacecraft applications: for\nexample, to oscillate instruments as diverse\nas x-ray telescopes, magnetometers,\naccelerometers, and agricultural spraying\nnozzles in a variety of scan pattems that\ncould include linear, circular, and raster.\nAn auxiliary control mechanism for a\nRUM actuator would serve to position\nand reposition the central coordinate\nabout which the oscillating motion is produced. In the case of a line scan, it could\nbe used to establish the midpoint of the\nline. In the case of a raster scan, it could\nproduce the relatively slow motion along\none raster axis while the RUM actuator\nwould produce the faster oscillating motion\nalong the perpendicular raster axis.\nThe figure illustrates schematically\nan instrument equipped with a RUM\nactuator for oscillation about a single axis\nto produce a line scan, plus a simple auxiliary control mechanism of the proposed\ntype. The basic components of the auxiliary control mechanism would be a stepping motor, a speed-reducing (torqueincreasing) gear train, and an angularposition encoder. The stator of the stepping motor would be mounted on a stationary supporting structure, while the\nmotor would be connected to the lowtorque input shaft of the gear train.\nThe high-torque output shaft of the\ngear train would lie on the axis about\nwhich the instrument is to be oscillated\nand would be connected to the instrument via a torsionally flexible coupling.\n\n62\n\nness of the flexible coupling would be\nchosen so that the resonant frequency of\ntorsional oscillation of the instrument\nwould equal the derived scanning frequency. Adjustable trim masses could be\nadded to enable tuning to resonance and\n\nThe encoder would monitor the angular\nposition ot the high-torque shaft. Driven\nby the RUM actuator, the instrument\nwould oscillate torsionally, via the flexible\ncoupling, about the angular position of the\nhigh-torque shaft.

The\nresonance would amplify the effect of the\nRUM actuator (the dampers would reduce\nthe amplification effect somewhat) so\nthat the same scanning motion could be\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1995\n\nachieved with smaller unbalanced masses.\nWith smaller masses, the RUM actuator\nwould consume less power: numerical\nexamples from representative design\ncases suggest that RUM actuators\nequipped with auxiliary control mechanisms of this type could consume less\npower than do equally capable RUM actuators of older design, and as little as 1/100\nthe power of scanning mechanisms based\non gimbal torque actuators.\nThe proposed auxiliary control mechanism as described thus far could be operated manually, in a quasi-open-loop fashion: A human operator would monitor the\nangular position of the high-torque shaft\nand issue step commands until the\ndesired center-of-scan position was\nattained. No further adjustment or monitoring would be needed until it would be\nnecessary to establish a different center-of-scan position. Alternatively, the\nstepping motor could be operated under\nangular-position-feedback control.\nIn comparison with previously designed\nRUM auxiliary control mechanisms, the\nproposed RUM auxiliary control mechanisms would be simpler and cheaper.\nThey would be particularly suited for\napplications in which it is permissible to\nsacrifice some scanning precision for the\nsake of reducing weight, cost, and power\nconsumption. In some cases, the reduction in power demand may make it feasible to use small batteries or solar cells as\nthe sources of power.\n\nThis work was done by Michael E.\nPolites and Dean C.

In general, the optimum inlet angle depends on such other\nvariables as the mach number, altitude,\nand ambient temperature. The optimum\ninlet angle as a function of these variables can be approximated by a schedule (the "inlet ramp schedule") of digitized\nvalues that can be implemented by a digital control system .\nResearch shows that the inlet ramp\nschedules of different engines that could\nbe installed in the same supersonic airplane can all be corrected with enginedemand airflow. More specifically, the\nresearch shows that the optimum inlet\nangle depends primarily on the engine-\n\ndemand airflow and is good for all altitudes and ambient temperatures. Thus,\none can develop a simple inlet ramp\nschedule of inlet angle as a function of\nengine-demand airflow.

This new system\nenables scientists to study more closely\nthan ever before the conditions needed\nto ignite and sustain a fusion reaction,\nand is expected to be an important precursor of the National Ignition Facility\n(NIF), scheduled to be completed later\nthis decade (see Laser Tech Briefs, April\n1995, page 6a). A joint project of scientists at Rochester, Lawrence Uvermore,\nSandia, and Los Alamos laboratories, the\n\nNIF will be the biggest laser fusion\nmachine ever built. The Department of\nEnergy has designated Uvermore as the\npreferred site for NIF and is seeking\nfunds to begin construction next year.\nThe Omega system is a 30-kJ pulsed\nNd:glass laser emitting a frequencytripled beam at 351 nm. In boosting the\nfootball-field-sized Omega to its present\ncapacity, engineers increased its energy\noutput by a factor of 25, making it the\nworld\'s most powerful ultraviolet fusion\nlaser. It exceeds the present capacity of\nUvermore\'s indirect-drive Nova system ,\nwhose beams are converted to x-rays\nbefore hitting the target. But though it\nwas designed primarily for direct-drive\nexperiments, research with Omega is\nexpected to help physicists understand\nphenomena of both methods. And since\nDOE has designated LLE the National\nLaser Users\' Facility, scientists from all\nover the country will be able to use it to\nconduct high-energy laser experiments.\nIn direct-drive fusion research, Omega\nwill be used to explore target physics at\nnear-ignition conditions, with ion temperatures in excess of 2-3 keV and fuel density/radius products of more than about\n\n2 g/cm2 ; to investigate the hydrodynamics of energy-scaled high-performance\ntargets; and to perform laser-plasma\ninteraction experiments relevant to\ndirect-drive target implosions.\n\nHotter than the Sun\nAfter the laser creates it, Omega\'s\nbeam is amplified and expanded many\ntimes, travelling a total of more than 500\nfeet and splitting into 60 beams before\nreaching the target. Housing the hydrogen target is an aluminum chamber 11\nfeet in diameter, with ports for several\ndiagnostic instruments as well as for the\nbeams, which are reflected by mirrors\naround the structure into the chamber.\nEach of Omega\'s beams is aimed to hit a\nspecified section of the target with an\naccuracy of within 25 microns.\nIn the target chamber, the beams converge on a plastiC or glass cylinder less\nthan a millimeter wide filled with deuterium and tritium, two isotopes of hydrogen. The beams ablate the target\'s shell\nand implode the thermonuclear fuel to\nobtain pressures and temperatures high\nenough to fuse the isotopes.\nInside the chamber, temperatures can\n\nThe Omega laser driver line and injection optics along with portions of the laser system are seen in a view looking southwest in the laser bay.\nAugust 1995\n\n3a\n\nreach up to 50 million \xc2\xb0C, hotter than the\ninside of the Sun. Because of such elevated temperatures, Omega\'s glass, mirrors, and lenses need some time to cool\ndown between shots. Therefore the laser\ncan be operated just once per hour.\nAs the atoms of the target fuel fuse,\nthey give off energy in the form of neutrons, which can be used to generate\nelectricity. But for fusion to be useful as\nan energy source, it must reach what\nresearchers call \xc2\xb7scientific breakeven:"\nthat is, the energy to emerge from the\nfusion reaction must be greater than\nwhat is needed to create it.\n\nTwo Decades of Advances\nLLE\'s credentials for reaching the goal\nof inertial confinement fusion are many.\nAs long ago as 1976, LLE\'s materials\ngroup led the development of high-gain,\nlow-index-of-refraction phosphate laser\nglass for Nd:glass laser systems. In\n1980, LLE scientists developed a\nmethod of converting Omega\'s laser light\nfrom the infrared to the ultraviolet, which\nis absorbed more efficiently by a pellet of\nfuel. Called polarization mismatch, this\nblue-light conversion method has since\nbeen adopted by all high-power solidstate ICF programs in the world.\nAccording to Stephen Jacobs of LLE,\npolarization mismatch has increased the\neffectiveness of Omega as a fusion driver\nby a factor of ten. LLE engineers completed conversion of the Omega to 351nm operation in 1985.\nIn 1989, LLE announced its pioneering\nbeam-smoothing technique to produce\nmore uniform beam profiles for its frequency-tripled laser systems. Called\nsmoothing by spectral dispersion (SSD).\nthe method reduced the variations in illumination of a pellet from 30 percent\ndown to just a few percent. SSD has\nsince been implemented on Lawrence\nLivermore\'s Nova laser.\n\nD(lIOmm)\n\n,.\nThe Omega upgrade is an image-relayed system with three laser drivers, six amplification\nstages, and frequency conversion. Ninety-seven percent of beam energy is furnished by the\nlast three amplifiers.\nThe laboratory has issued 14 licenses for\nthe use of these patents in producing\ncommercial products.\nAs the National Laser Users\' Facility,\nLLE provides researchers with unique\ncapabilities for experiments in high-energy-density physics, as well as such other\nareas as plasma physics, x-ray laser\nphysics, extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy,\nand\ninstrumentation\ndevelopment.\nLaboratory staff includes 191 professional, technical, and administrative person-\n\nnel, and more than 100 graduate and\nundergraduate students from the university\'s optics, physics, and engineering\ndepartments participate in LLE programs.\nHailing the Omega upgrade, Victor H.\nReis, Assistant Secretary for Defense\nPrograms at the Department of Energy,\ncalled it "a highly flexible world-class laser\nthat will serve the inertial fusion program\nwell for many years .... The laser was on\ntime and on budget. The department is\nproud of this, the newest of our facilities."\n~T8\n\nReaching Out to Industry\nAs part of the University of Rochester\'s\noutreach program, LLE has collaborated\nwith industry and government in technology development. Companies which\nhave contributed resources include the\nEmpire State Electric Research Corp.,\nExxon Research and Engineering Co.,\nClarklMXR, Spectra-Physics, Rochester\nGas and Electric, General Electric, and\nStandard Oil Co. In addition to DOE support, the New York State Energy\nResearch and Development Authority\nhas contributed important backing.\nLLE scientists hold more than 63\npatents in such fields as laser amplifiers,\nactive mirrors, fusion target fabrication\nand coating, ultrafast switching, x-ray\nlithography, and liquid crystal devices.\n4a\n\nView of target shot in the Omega\'s target chamber.\nAugust 1995\n\nYour laser is vital to your work ...\nwhy trust just any chiller to cool it?\nAt NESLAB, we have over 30 years\nexperience in the temperature control\nbusiness.

The\nstartup currents of the boost-topology\nswitcher were very high, causing startup\nfailure at heavy loads. Also, the efficiency\nof the switcher was about 83% compared with about 95% for the voltagedoubler circuit.\nNoise is a major design consideration at\nlow operating voltages. Noise spikes from\nthe boost-topology switcher\'s inductor\nwere being coupled into the NO circuitry,\nbut the voltage doubler did not produce\nspikes, and its ramp-shaped ripple (as\ncompared with a spike) was easy to filter.\nThe photovoltaic converter is shuntregulated at 1.65 V, which is very close to\nthe optimum power-out point of the V-I\noutput characteristic curve for this 2-V\n(open circuit voltage) converter. If it was\nreplaced by the 6-V version of the converter and linearly regulated to 5 V, or\nstepped down with a buck-topology\nswitcher, the resulting circuit would not\noperate at the optimal power point of the\n6-V version\'s V-I curve for the output current target of 10 mA; the 6-V part has a\nhigher internal impedance. The circuit\nwas used to power a Motorola 68HC05\ncentral processing unit (CPU) connected\n\nElectronic sensors powered by fiber\noptics may be a low-cost off-the-shelf\nalternative to fiber-based sensors in\nsome applications. While using less\nexpensive electronic equipment, the system has a totally fiber-based connection\nbetween a sensor and a data-recording\ndevice, offering electrical isolation\nbetween the sensor and the station\nreceiving the data. This greatly reduces\nthe introduction of potentially damaging\nnoise spikes into sensitive circuitry. The\navailability of low-power integrated circuits developed for the cellular telephone\nand laptop computer markets helped\nmake this possible, but the introduction\nof high-efficiency gallium arsenide photovoltaic converters made it practical.\nResearchers at\nEG&G\nEnergy\nMeasurements\' Los Alamos Operations-a Department of Energy contractor--are\ndeveloping the fiber-powered electronic\nsensors. Their circuits are powered by\nlight from a fiber optic cable connected\nto a small laser. The circuit will deliver the\ndesired 3.3 V at 10 mA to a low-power\ndata acquisition circuit. The total conversion efficiency is 40% at this time.\nInstead of using a boost-topology\nswitcher to step up 2 V to 3.3 V, in labo-\n\nto an Analog Devices AD7714 NO converter and driving a Brown Boveri fibercoupled light-emitting diode with the\ndata from the CPU UART. The circuit\ndraws 4 mA at 3.3 V, running at a CPU\nclock rate of 2.4 MHz and a rate of 9600\nbaud. Up to 6 mA of current can be allocated to power the sensors feeding the\nNO and still remain within the bounds of\nthe 1O-mA current budget.\nThis technology could benefit the automotive industry by reducing ignition noise\nduring tests, and the electrical power\nindustry by allowing experiments and\ntesting in high-voltage areas. In medicine, it would be a way to isolate patients\nfrom wall current and thus from both\nelectrical interference and the potential\ndangers of equipment failure.\nThis work is being done by Noor\nKhalsa and Ron Ramsey at EG&G\nEnergy Measurements\' Los Alamos\nOperations.

The application\nshows promise in laser spectroscopy.\nThe compact, rugged lasers are designed\nto survive and operate in extreme\nmechanical and thermal environments.\nThe group has developed a UV laser\nsource with eight simultaneous channels.\nThe system, built around their compact\nlaser (less than 50 cu. in.) rated at 700\nmJ per pulse (10 ns nominal), generates\n100 mJ of UV laser light. The conversion\nefficiency is approximately 65 percent in\nthe second harmonic (530 nm) and 35\n\npercent in the fourth harmonic (265 nm).\nThese results are accomplished with a\nhighly multimode input, a fact that distinguishes it from performance reported in\nthe literature by others. The optical system\'s volume is 475 cu. in. The design\nalso includes a custom thermoelectric\ncooler for the KO*P doubling crystal.\nThe laser pulses can be used for megavolt/mega-amp switching networks with\nnanosecond timing resolution between\nmultiple switches. At the other end of the\napplication spectrum, the UV light can be\nused to ablate materials and determine\nthe concentration of metals for contamination study in a variety of situations.\nApplications\nexamples\ninclude\nradioactive-species identification, realtime heavy metal contamination analysis\nof soils and building materials, and per-\n\nhaps measurement of lead concentration\nin blood screening for schoolchildren.\nExtremely high-energy transmissions of\nlight pulses through optical fiber in conjunction with this type of system have\nbeen proven . Other applications of this\ntechnology range from ordnance initiation systems to factory-environment\nmanufacturing systems for laser welding,\ndrilling, cutting, and power transmission.\nThis work was done at the\nAlliedSignal Kansas City Plant, operated for the US Department of Energy\nunder contract DE-AC04-76DP00613.\nFor additional technical information, contact Jim Hendrix at (816) 997-3483.\nInquiries concerning the availability of\nthis technology should be addressed to\nTom Davis in AlliedSignal\'s Office of\nTechnology Transfer; (816) 997-5275.\n\nA prototype of the compact eight-channel UV laser system.\n\nHo:Tm:Lu:Al s012 as an Infrared-Laser Material\nThis material was selected on the basis of quantum-mechanical modeling of lasing properties.\n\nLang/ey Research Center, Hampton, Virginia\nLutetium aluminum garnet doped\nwith\nholmium\nand\nthulium\n(Ho:Tm:Lu~150\'2\'\nalso\ncalled\n"Ho:Tm:LuAG") has been shown to be\nuseful as a room-temperature infrared8a\n\nlaser material. This material was selected from among a number of candidate\nmaterials for the development of a laser\nthat would operate at room temperature\nat a wavelength near 2.0 ~m, but with\n\nan efficiency greater than the efficiencies of 2.0-~m room-temperature\nlasers based on Ho:Tm:Y3 AI 50 ,2\n("Ho:Tm:YAG") and on Ho:Tm:YLiF4\n("Ho:Tm:YLF"). Other desirable charac August 1995\n\nteristics for the candidate materials\nincluded compatibility with pumping by\nGaAlAs laser diodes at a wavelength in\nthe vicinity of 0.8 f-lm , plus good thermal\nand mechanical properties.\nThe investigation of Ho:Tm:LusAI 50 ,2\nand other candidate laser materials\ninvolved special attention to what was\nconsidered to be the greatest problem\nassociated with room-temperature lasers\nat wavelengths near 2.0 f-lm; namely,\nhigh thresholds. A theoretical expression\nwas developed to describe the lasing\nthreshold of a material in terms of such\nparameters of the material as the thermal\noccupation of the lower laser level and\nthe effective stimulated emission cross\nsection. A sophisticated mathematical\nmodel based on quantum mechanics\nwas used to evaluate these parameters.\nThen the threshold was evaluated for\neach laser material and the materials with\nlow thresholds were considered to be\ndesirable candidates.\nHo:Tm:Lu3AI50 \'2 features relatively\nlow thermal occupation of its lower laser\nlevel because this level is higher than are\nthe corresponding levels of most of the\nother available laser materials. In addition, Ho:Tm:LusAI50 \'2 has a reasonably\nlarge effective cross section for stimulated emission because of the contribution\nof several transitions around a central\nstrong transition . A low threshold results\nfrom the combination of these properties, making the performance of this\nlaser material potentially superior to\nthose of other commercially available\nlaser materials. While Ho is the element\nthat participates in the main laser\nprocess, it does not absorb the pump\nradiation efficiently by itself. Tm is incorporated into the laser material to absorb\nthe pump radiation and efficiently transfer the energy of that radiation to the Ho\n(see Figure 1).\nYet another desirable property of\nHo:Tm :LusAI 50 \'2 is that its calculated\nrate of upconversion is lower than\nthose of other laser materials like\nHo:Tm:YAI 50 ,2 and HoTm:YLiF4 \xe2\x80\xa2 Inasmuch as upconversion detracts from the\nefficiency of a laser, this lower rate of\nupconversion is highly desirable. Finally,\nlike other garnets, LusAl sO\'2 has thermal\nand mechanical properties suitable for\nhigh performance in lasers.\nAn experimental Ho:Tm:Lu3AlsO\'2\nlaser was constructed, pumped by a\n0\nTi:AI 2 3 laser at a wavelength of 0.781\nf-lm (to simulate pumping by a GaAlAs\nlaser diode at about this wavelength) .\nFluorescence at room temperature in the\nwavelength range of 1.6 to 2.2 f-lm was\nobserved, with a peak at 2.1 f-lm (see\nFigure 2). The efficiency of this laser was\nlimited by the thinness of the\nAugust 1995\n\nFigure 1.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA hand-held portaible unit emits ultraviolet light similar to that\nemitted by hydrogen burning in air. The unit was developed for\nuse in testing optoelectronic hydrogen-fire detectors, which\nrespond to ultraviolet light at wavelengths from 180 to 240 nm.\nThis wavelength range is unique in that within it, hydrogen fires\nemit small but detectable amounts of radiation, light from\nincandescent lamps and the Sun is almost completely absent,\nand air is sufficiently transmissive to enable detection of a\nhydrogen fire from a distance. Consequently, this spectral\nregion is favoraible for detecting hydrogen fires while minimizing\nfalse alanms.\nIn operation, the hand-held unit is aimed toward a hydrogenfire detector from a prescribed distance and direction and\nturned on to simulate a hydrogen fire. The hand-held unit\nreplaces an ultraviolet flashlight that was previously used to test\nhydrogen-fire detectors of three different levels of sensitivity at\nvarious distances and was powerful enough to trigger alarms in\nthe least sensitive units at the maximum distance of 54 ft. (",16\nmi. However, the flashlight was much too powerful for testing\nmore sensitive units at smaller distances, and there was no way\nto adjust the intenSity of its ultraviolet output. There was also no\nprovision for calibration of the ultraviolet output.\nAs in the ultraviolet flashlight, the source of ultraviolet light in\nthe present hand-held unit is a krypton discharge lamp. This\nlamp was chosen, not only because its ultraviolet spectrum is\ncompatible with that of the hydrogen-fire detectors but also\nbecause of its low power consumption. A sapphire lens concentrates the output of the lamp into a beam with a divergence of\n\'" 10\xc2\xb0. The unit includes an internal photodetector that monitors\nthe intensity of the lamp during a calibration procedure, and a\nmicroprocessor that implements the procedure. The unit is powered by a 9-V battery, which lasts about 100 on/off test cycles.\nThe intensity of the output is set at one of five discrete levels\nby use of a disk that contains openings of five different sizes:\nthe disk is rotated to place the desired opening in front of the\nlamp. The disk can also be rotated to a sixth position with no\nopening for calibration. A spring-loaded set screw and a small\ndetent hold the disk at each position. To operate the unit, the\nuser turns the disk to the appropriate setting and presses an\n"on" button. If the battery voltage is adequate, a green lightemitting diode flashes, indicating that it is all right to proceed to\ntest a hydrogen-fire detector.\nTo initiate a calibration procedure, the user rotates the disk to\nthe calibration position, in which there is no opening between\nthe lamp and the outside world. When the disk is in this position, a small hole inside the disk allows light to travel to an optical interrupter, which responds by sending a signal that indicates to the microprocessor that calibration has been requested. In this configuration, pressing the "on" button causes the\ncontrol circuitry in the unit to turn the lamp on and off, monitor\nthe intensity of the output, and modify the current supplied to\nthe lamp to lock set the intensity at a determined level. The signal for setting the current is saved in a memory circuit and used\nto set the current until another calibration is requested. This\napproach to calibration is based partly on the assumption that\nthe intensity of the output will not drift during an interval of a few\nhours. Thus far, tests have validated this assumption.\n\nThis work was done by Gregory A. Hall and William E. Larson\n\nP.O.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nFiber-optic sensors are being developed for use in measuring concentrations\nof ammonia and ethylene near plants during experiments on the growth of the\nplants in enclosed environments. The roles\nof ethylene and ammonia in plant growth\nare not yet known, but it is known that\nplants emit these gases, and it has been\nconjectured that these gases either give\nrise to, or at least are associated with,\nenvironmental stresses on plants. The\ndevelopmental fiber-optic sensors satisfy a\nneed to measure concentrations as low as\na few parts per billion (ppb) and are thus\nexpected to contribute to research on the\nroles of ethylene and ammonia in the\ngrowth of plants.\nFiber-optic chemical sensors are also\ncalled "optrodes" and have been\ndescribed in a number of previous articles\nin NASA Tech Briefs. An optrode typically\nincludes a clear plastic lead-in optical\nfiber, a porous glass or polymeric sensing\nlength of optical fiber with a chromophoric reagent sensitive to the analyte (the\nchemical to be detected) embedded in\nthe glass or polymeric matrix, and a clear\nplastic lead-out optical fiber. The atmosphere containing the analyte permeates\nthe pores, bringing the analyte into contact with the chromophoric reagent. The\nreaction between the analyte and the\nchromophoric agent changes the spectral\ncharacteristics of the sensing length of the\nfiber: in simplistiC terms, it changes the\ncolor of the fiber by an amount proportional to the concentration of the analyte.\nIn the case of these particular\noptrodes, the spectral characteristic of\nen\n\n~ 0.4\nC\n\nCal\nala;\n\n~~\n\n~\n\n3: 0.3\n\n~\n\nIII 0\n\n,g~\n\n~c;; 0.2\n\n~ .~\nc .- :\n\n\\\\\n\n~ .~ 0.1\n\n~\n\n\xc2\xa3 \'~\n\ne\n\n0.00\n\n50\n\nf-\n\nr--o t--a100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nConcentration of Ammonia, ppm\n\nThe Response of an Optrode to the concentration of ammonia in water is fairly sensitive up to about 50 ppm.\nAugust 1995\n\ninterest is the ratio between the spectral\ntransmissivities at two different wavelengths.

The outstanding feature of\nthis velocimeter would be an imagerotating optical subsystem that would\ntransform the velocity-probing laser\nbeams into the rotating reference frame\nfrom the stationary laboratory reference\nframe, in which the beams would be\ngenerated. Thus, the transformed\nbeams would be stationary with respect\nto the rotor blade; this would enable the\ncontinuous monitoring of the velocity of\n\n14a\n\nflow at some point in the reference\nframe attached to the blade, provided\nthat the blade did not vibrate.\nThe figure illustrates schematically the\nmajor optical components. The output\nof a laser would be divided by a beam\nsplitter into two parallel beams, which\nwould be steered by a stationary mirror\nonto a path coaxial with the rotor. On\nthe way up toward the rotor, the beams\nwould pass through an image-rotating\noptic, which could be a Dove prism, a\nPechan prism, a folded Abbe prism, or\na three-mirror device like the one in the\n\nFor More Infonnatlon Write In No. 467\n\nfigure. When an optic of this kind is\nrotated through an angle 9 about the\noptical axis (which is also the axis of the\nhelicopter rotor in this case) , the image\nviewed through the optic rotates\nthrough an angle 29. The image-rotating\noptic would be made to rotate in\nsynchronism with the rotor but at half\nthe rotor speed . Thus, the beams\nemerging from the top of .the imagerotating optic would be stationary with\nrespect to the turning rotor.\nThe beams would travel up along the\nhollow rotor shaft to a focusing lens,\nwhich would make them intersect at a\npoint that would define the center of the\nprobe volume. A mirror would steer the\nintersecting beams to position the point\nof intersection at the desired height\nabove the surface of the blade and at\nthe desired horizontal coordinate downstream or upstream of the leading edge.\nLight back-scattered from small particles (e.g., dust) entrained in the flow\nthat passes through the probe volume\nwould be focused by a SchmidtCassegrain collector into an optical\nfiber. The collector and fiber would be\npart of the rotating assembly. Using the\noptical analog of an electrical slipring,\nthe other end of the fiber would be\naligned along the axis of rotation, along\nwhich the light would be coupled out to\nthe non rotating laboratory reference\nframe. This light would contain the\nfrequency information that can be related to the velocity of the light-scattering\nparticles; the light signal would be\ndetected and processed by standard\nlaser-velocimeter circuitry and processing methods.\nThe systell! arranged as shown in\nthe figure would be sensitive to velocity in the plane of the page along a line\nslightly tilted with respect to the axis of\nthe rotor. A second coaxial dual-laser\nbeam subsystem of different color\nAugust 1995\n\ncould be aimed at the same probe volume along the same bisector of the\nintersecting beams, but in a plane of\nintersection perpendicular to that of the\nfirst two beams; this would enable the\nsimultaneous measurement of velocity\nalong the horizontal direction running\ndownstream or upstream of the leading\nor trailing edge. A third such subsystem\nof yet another color, aimed at the same\nprobe volume from a final turning mirror\nat a different axial location, could\nenable the measurement of the third\n\ncomponent of velocity, although this\nmeasurement would be coupled with\nthe other two and would have to be\nuncoupled in processing.\nThis work was done by Stephen E.\nDunagan of Ames Research Center.\nFor further information, write in 24 on\nthe TSP Request Card.\nInquiries concerning rights for the\ncommercial use of this invention should\nbe addressed to the Patent Counsel,\nAmes Research Center; (415) 604-5104.\nRefer to ARC-13106.\n\nTo Photodetector and\n/\\\nSignal-Processing Electronics ......-\n\n0\n\nNONROTATING\n\nS~~RL\n\nModel No. LUPt-n\nAFAS interferometric Test Station\n\nOptical Fiber\n\nModel No.\nTOAN7.5-8Q\nReflective Collimator\n\nFinal Turning Mirror\n\nProbe\nVolume\n\nOff-AxIs Parabolic,\nAat & Spherical\nMirrors/ Mounts\n\n\\\nRotor Blade\nLens\n\nROTOR ASSEMBLY, ROTATING AT\nANGULAR SPEED 0)\nRotor Shaft\n\nCOAR - lOxlO-HQ Off AxIs\nBeam Expander\n\nIMAGE-ROTATING OPTIC,\nROTATING AT ANGULAR SPEED 0lI2\n\nNONROTATING\n\nFX15/ 5 F Fourier System\n\nLaser\n\nSPACE OPTICS\n\nRESEARCH LABS\nA DMSION OF INTERGRAPH\nThe Laser Beams Would Be Transformed by the image rotator. so that they would be stationary in the coordinate frame attached to the rotor blade.\nAugust 1995\n\n7 Stuart Road, Chelmsford, MA 01824\n(508) 256-4511, 1-800-552-7675\nFAX (508) 256-5605\nFor More Infonnatlon Write In No. 468\n\nA Photonically Based Receive Signal\nCombiner for RF Phased Arrays\nThe use of photonic implementation of a receive signal combiner\nin an RF phased-array antenna can reduce the weight of the\nantenna and provide several performance improvements.\nRome Laboratory, Photonics Center, Griffiss AFB, New York\nRecent work has proven the advantage of implementing a receive signal\ncombiner for an RF phased -array\nantenna in optical waveguides rather\nthan in coaxial cable or pressurized RF\nwaveguides.\nIn the demonstration of this project,\nconducted under an effort entitled\n"Microwave Optical Interconnect for RF\nPhased !mays," a number of possible\nsignal-combining efforts were examined.\nHere the slot radiators were followed by\nlow-noise amplifiers (LNAs) and RF phase\nshifters. A diode-pumped Nd:YAG optical\nsource operating at 1319 nm provided\nthe optical signal to each of the four electro-optic modulators.\nThis resulted in four time-delay-equalized fiber optiC links. The outputs of each\nof the four separate detectors were combined in a ring configuration. The RF output of the system is at 3.3 GHz.\nThe demonstration was conducted in\na 16-element array with 4 active array\nelements. The receive beam was steered\nover a 120-degree scan angle. In addition, monopulse beam steering was\ndemonstrated with more than 50 dB signal cancellation.\nThe technique demonstrated on this\nproject is one of several that were studied.\nThe decision to use a common optical\nsource rather than separate optical\nsources was based upon concerns regard-\n\ning coherence effects such as noise.\nThis photonic-based receive signal\ncombining technique could be applied to\nsubarrays rather than individual elements,\nas accomplished in this demonstration.\nA study has shown that the use of this\nreceive signal-combining technique could\nreduce the weight of an airborne surveillance radar by about 30 percent with a\ncorresponding reduction in the size and\nnumber of fuselage penetrations.\nRome Laboratory is also continuing\ninvestigations into other areas of photonic implementation into phased arrays for\nsurveillance and communications applications.

Such lines offer large bandwidths\nand wide dynamic range, all in a small\npackage size. Several different methods\nhave been demonstrated using fiber\ndelay lines, most of which use several\nfixed lengths of fiber to achieve stepped\ntime delay.\nThe method employed in the current\nexample exploits fiber dispersion to\nachieve a variable time delay. By tuning\nthe wavelength the relative time delay is\nchanged. A 1-km length of high-dispersion fiber (-98ps/km-nm) has yielded\napproximately 5 ns of delay over a 50nm tuning range.\nTapped delay-line filters are the\nweighted sum of several delayed versions of the same RF signal. Using the\ndispersion in fiber as the delay medium,\nit is possible to create a spectrum of RF\ndelayed signals. In this idealized\nscheme, a broadband incoherent light\nsource modulated with an RF signal\nwould create this delay spectrum.\nBecause of practical considerations, it is\nmuch easier to create a "sampled"\nbroadband source by using several\nsources at various wavelengths. This\ncomb of wavelengths can be weighted\nand summed to produce a more traditional transversal filter.\nThe configuration of the tapped\ndelay-line filter is shown in the figure.\nThis system uses 8 tunable laser diodes\n\nto form the 8 spaced time delays. The\nwavelength tunablity of the diodes allow\na reconfigurable time separation\nbetween taps. The weighting of each\ntap is changed by varying the current\nsent to the particular diode. The 8\nstepped wavelengths are combined by\na star coupler and sent to a modulator.\nAn external LiNb03 modulator is used\nto avoid any bulk time delays and to\nallow for high-frequency operation. The\ncomb of wavelengths is then propagated through a 1-km length of high-dispersion fiber. The relative time delays\nseen between two adjacent taps is\ndefined by\n~\'t =~WL\n\nwhere ~\').. is the wavelength difference\nbetween the two taps, D is the dispersion of the fiber, and L is the fiber length.\nIn our system, tap spacing can be easily changed by varying the wavelength of\neach diode. This tunablity also implies\nthat unequal tap spacing can be used,\nand work is continuing to explore its signal-processing implications.\nThis work was done by Douglas\nNorton and Steven Johns of the Air\nForce Photonics Center, Surveillance\nand Photonics Directorate, Rome\nLaboratory, Griffiss AFB, New York.

Unlike some of the\npreviously developed structures, these\nstructures can be fabricated without precise machining and precise alignment\nsteps, and the remaining steps needed to\nfabricate these panels are fewer and simpler. Also, the core is fabricated without\nthe use of adhesives, which reduces\noverall outgassing potential and weight\ncontributions. Consequently, the fabrication times and costs are reduced.\nThe developmental panel structures\ncan be made in many variations of the\nbasic eggcrate core/sandwich design.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the basic design\ncalls for an aggregate of square modular composite-material core units\nbonded to each other on their mating\nsides, with face sheets bonded to the\ncore. Four bonded core units intersect\nat each interior junction, providing a\ncontinuation of the properties of the\ncomposite material through the junction. The core units and face sheets\ncan be made of a variety of matrix\nand fiber materials, laminated in a\nvariety of layups and thicknesses, and\nassembled in a variety of geometries\nto impart the desired mechanical, thermal, and other properties to the finished structure.\n\nComposite Prepreg\nWrapped on Tooling Block\n\nTOP VIEW WITH FACE SHEETS REMOVEO\n\nSIDE VIEW\n\nFigure 1. This Structure Is Representative\nof the eggcrate core/ sandwich panel structures described in the text. A typical practical structure could be more complex: it\ncould contain more cells and/or reinforcing\nand bonding tabs, or the cells could have\ndifferent (e.g., hexagonal) shapes.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1995\n\nFigure 2. Tooling Blocks Wrapped With Pre preg Strips are assembled in preparation for\ncuring the strips to form the eggcrate core.\n\n67\n\nMany variations in fabrication are also\npossible. A typical process for making a\nstructure like that of Figure 1 begins with the\npreparation of strips of composite prepreg\nmaterial, which is typically a laminate of four\nplies of graphite fibers (oriented at 0", 45\xc2\xb0,\n90\xc2\xb0, and -45j with a partially cured epoxy\nmatrix. These strips are cut to fit tooling\nblocks that serve as mandrels for the\neggcrate core units. The prepreg strips are\nwrapped around the blocks, then the\nwrapped blocks are placed on a tooling\nplate and pushed together (see Figure 2),\nthus pressing the wrapped prepreg strips\ninto a unitary core structure with adjacent\nunits joined together in symmetric eight -ply\n(0\xc2\xb0, 45\xc2\xb0, 90\xc2\xb0, -45\xc2\xb0, -45\xc2\xb0, 90\xc2\xb0, 45\xc2\xb0, 0\xc2\xb0) walls.\nBy use of a standard autoclave technique,\nthe units are kept pressed together and\n\nheated to cure the epoxy, thus bonding the\nunits together to form a rigid eggcrate core.\nAfter the cure, the tooling blocks are\nremoved from the core. Face sheets\nmade of the same or a different compOSite material are then bonded secondarily to the core to complete the sandwich structure. Alternatively, one prepreg\nface sheet can be included in the tooling-plate/tooling-block/core-unit assembly and autoclave-cured along with the\ncore units to obtain a unitary single-facesheetleggcrate-core structure; then the\ntooling blocks can be removed, and the\nother face sheet bonded secondarily to\ncomplete the sandwich structure. In yet\nanother of many alternatives, both face\nsheets are included in the toolingplate/tooling-block/core-unit assembly\n\nand autoclave-cured along with the core\nunits to form a complete unitary sandwich structure. In this case, the tooling\nblocks must be made of a lightweight\nfoam material that can be allowed to\nremain in the core, or else they could be\nmade of a material that can be dissolved or melted, to remove them from\nthe core after curing.\nThis work was done by Charles J.\nMagurany of Lockheed Engineering and\nSciences Co. for Langley Research\nCenter.

This method is an extension of the\nmethod described in "Adjoint-Operator\nLearning for a Neural Network" (NPO18352), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 17, No. 10\n(October, 1993), page 55.\nA lengthy description of the theoretical foundation of the method is prerequisite to give meaning to even a brief\nsummary of the method. [A similar (but\nnot identical) theoretical foundation was\ndescribed in the noted prior article.] The\nevolution of a neural network is considered to be governed by the following set\nof coupled nonlinear differential equations:\n\nun + /(nun\n\n=gn [Yn (~~mUm + In)], t >0\n\nwhere Un represents the output of the\nnth neuron and Tnm denotes the strength\nor weight of the synaptic coupling from\nthe mth to the nth neuron. The constant\nKj, characterizes the decay of neuron activity. The response of a neuron is governed by a Sigmoidal function, g, and its\ngain, y, typically, g(~) = tanh (gx). The\ntime-dependent term In(t) , called the\n"source" term, encodes contribution of\nthe nth component of the temporal pattern a(t) via the expression\n\nan(t)\nIn(t) = { 0\n\nif n denotes an input neuron\nif n denotes a hidden or\noutput neuron\n\nThe problem in learning is to adjust the\nsynaptic-coupling strengths T,.", to minimize a quantity called the "neuromorphic energy functional," E, given by\n\nE(u\';5) =\n\nJ; L r~dt = JFdt\nt\n\nn\n\n1\n\nwhere t = time, the integral is taken over\nsome finite inteNal , and\n\n_ { an(t) - Un\n\n~(t) -\n\n70\n\n0\n\nif n denotes an output neuron\nif n denotes an input or\nhidden neuron\n\n2\n\nThe vector f5 denotes the system of N\n(where N is the number of neurons) synaptic-coupling strengths:\n\nThe resulting equation is\n\nJ!; ~Il dt =Jt S\'~)l dt=JtV5.11 dt- [v U,Il]t,\n1\n\nThe solution of the learning problem\nbegins with the formulation of the updating\nof the parameter vector f5 as a descent\nalong the gradient of E in f5 space, starting\nfrom a guessed initial parameter vector.\nThe dynamics of the neural network (as\ndefined by the first equation presented\nabove) are incorporated into the gradient\ndescent by use of the adjoint operators.\nOne begins with a set of equations called\nthe "forward sensitivity equations":\n\nUn ,II\n{\n\n+\n\n~Anmum\'II=Sn\'Jl\n\nt >0\n\nUn ,II\n\n=\n\n0\n\nt =0\n\nThe computations of the gradient descent\nthen involve two stages, which correspond\nto the two terms on the right side of this\nequation. The first term is computed by use\nof the adjoint functions; the number of arithmetic operations in this computation is pr0portional to WL, where L is the number of\ntime steps used in numerical integration.\nThe main difficulty resides with the evaluation of the second term. To compute it,\nthe authors introduce an auxiliary adjoint\nsystem of equations:\n\nS = v(t)o(t- t,)\n\nin which\n\nAnm\n\nBy choosing\n\n= /(n 0nm - Yn gn ~m\'\n\nSn Il =Yn gn L~m um OpJJ.\' Inm \'\nm\nI\n\ngn represents the derivative of gn with\nrespect to Un, the subscript ",)1" denotes\npartial differentiation with respect to the\n)1th component of\nand 0 is the\nKronecker delta for the identity tensor. It\ncan be shown that the computational cost is\nreduced by the use of the adjoint functions, V; the nth component of which is\ndefined by one of the equations in a system of equations called "adjoint system of\nequations," namely,\n\np,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\'" T\n-v n+~Anmvm m\n\nSn\n\xc2\xb7\n\nTo put this equation in closed form, one\nmust define the source term S~ and temporal boundary conditions. Both should\nbe independent of f1, and its derivatives.\nTo begin the derivation of the improved\nmethod, one multiplies the forward sensitivity equations by V, and the adjoint system\nof equations by ull\' subtracts the two resulting equations, integrates over the time\ninteNai (to,t,), and selects the following new\nsource terms and boundary conditions:\n\n-._aF\n\nS\n\n-ifj\n\n{ v(t= 0) = 0\n\nz(t,) = 0\nthe authors can show\n\n[V ~Il]t,\n\nJ\'\n1\n\n=\n\n(Z ~Il)dt\n\n10\n\nNote that, even though the authors selected z(t,) = 0, they are still interested in\nsolving the auxiliary adjoint system, forward\nin time. Thus, the critical issue is how to\nselect initial condition ~.e., z(to )], that would\nresult in z(t,) = O. It has been demonstrated\nthat these initial and final conditions are related via a propagation kemel. Hence, computation of [V U , involves two substages:\n,Il]\'\na kemel propagation that entails a number of\narithmetic operations proportional to N 3L,\nand a numerical integration that requires a\nmatrix-vector multiplication at each time step\nand entails a number of arithmetic opera2\ntions proportional to N L.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA compact, reliable, rugged , automated cell-culture and frequency-agile\nmicrospectrofluorimetric apparatus is\nbeing developed to perform experiments that would involve photometric\nimaging observations of single live cells.\nIn the original application for which it\nwas conceived, the apparatus would\noperate mostly unattended aboard a\nspacecraft; potential terrestrial applications include automated or semiautomated diagnosis of pathological tissues\nin clinical laboratories, biomedical instrumentation, monitoring of biological\nprocess streams, and portable instrumentation for testing biological conditions in various environments. The appa-\n\n74\n\nratus would offer obvious advantages\nover present laboratory instrumentation\nthat is large and delicate, must be operated manually and attended frequently,\nand has limited capability for spectral\nmeasurement and/or imaging at only a\nfew wavelengths.\nThe apparatus (see Figure 1) would\ncontain modules that would accommodate multiple samples of live animal and\nplant cells, provide for automatic addition of various substances to stimulate\nthe cells, bring cell cultures to a microscope stage for spectrally resolved\nillumination and spectrally resolved\nimaging, and translate the stage to scan\nfor cells of interest. The specimen cul-\n\nture on the stage would be illuminated\nby light at a chosen wavelength or combination of wavelengths, and would be\nimaged in the microscope at another\nwavelength or wavelengths - for example, the wavelength(s) of fluorescence\nexcited in a particular substance of interest that binds to specific cell components and is thus indicative of cell structure . A charge-coupled-device video\ncamera attached to the microscope\nwould acquire the image. A computer in\nthe apparatus would process and store\nthe spectrally resolved image data\nacquired by the camera.\nOf the many advanced features of this\napparatus, one would contribute the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1995\n\nmost to its miniaturization, frequency\nagility, and ruggedness, and to its relative simplicity in comparison with other\napparatuses in which various illumination and observation spectra are\nobtained by mechanical switching of\nfixed-wavelength, band-pass filters and\ndichroic mirrors. That feature is the use\nof one or two acousto-optical tunable\nfilters (AOTF\'s): optionally, one to obtain\nthe illumination spectrum by filtering\nlight from a xenon arc lamp, and the\nother to select the wavelength(s) of light\nfrom the specimen to be imaged in the\ncamera (see Figure 2). AOTF\'s are solidstate electronically tunable devices that\nhave no moving parts, are small, and\ncan be switched rapidly from one wavelength to another. A conventional\nmechanically switched monochromator\nof high wavelength resolution (0.5 nm\nresolution in the wavelength range of\n400 to 520 nm) occupies a volume of\n4\n3\nabout 2,250 in.3 (about 3.7 x 10 cm )\nand can switch among a few wavelengths no more frequently than a few\ntimes per second.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nTortillas have been made from a modified recipe and sealed in low-pressure\nnitrogen in foil pouches in an effort to\nincrease their shelf life at room temperature. Preliminary tests show that the\nshelf life of these tortillas is at least five\nmonths; in contrast, commercial tortillas\nlast only a few days.\nThe ingredients in the modified recipe\nare similar to those of the basic tortilla\nrecipe except that some of the water is\nreplaced by glycerin to inhibit the growth\nof microorganisms. It is particularly necessary to avoid Clostridium botulinum,\nwhich can grow in anaerobic environments and produce the deadly toxin that\ncauses botulism. The minimum water\nactivity (the ratio between the partial\npressure of water in the tortilla and the\npartial pressure of pure water) below\nwhich Clostridium botulinum cannot\ngrow is about 0.90.\n\n78\n\nAccordingly, the proportions of water\nand glycerin in the modified recipe (see\ntable) were chosen by experimentation\nto achieve a sufficiently low water activity (about 0.88) to prevent the growth of\nClostridium botulinum while maintaining\nacceptable taste. A preference test\nshowed that there is no significant difference between the taste of the long-shelflife tortillas and commercial tortillas.\nFerrous salts are added to each foil\npackage to remove any oxygen that\nremains inside after sealing in the tortillas\nwith nitrogen. These measures prevent\nmold and yeast from growing on the torti\x01\x01as after packaging. The factor that limits shelf life is now the retrogradation of\nthe starch fraction of the tortillas; that is,\nthe tortillas grow stale.\nThis work was done by Charles\nBourland of Johnson Space Center\nand Kimberly Glaus-Late of Lockheed\n\nEngineering and Sciences Co.

Changes in shape can be tailored\nsince the transformation temperatures\ncan be selectively tuned over a broad\nrange. The response times of a shapememory-alloy actuator are directly controlled via the rates of heating and cooling.

The report describes experimental welds made on aluminum in ambient\nair, under helium purge, and under chilledhelium purge. While a vast improvement\nwas obtained by use of the helium purge,\na further improvement was obtained by\nuse of the chilled-helium purge.\nThis work was done by William F.\nMcGee and Daniel J. Rybicki of Martin\nMarietta for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

Refer to MFS-3101O.\n\nMathematics and\nInformation Sciences\nNumerical Stability in\nHyperbolic BoundaryValue Problems\nA technical memorandum discusses\nthe stability of numerical solutions involving semidiscrete approximations to\nhyperbolic partial differential equations in\ninitial-and-boundary-value problems.\nThis is a topic of practical significance\nbecause hyperbolic partial differential\nequations arise in the mathematical\nmodeling of waves and blasts. Solutions\nare often needed over restricted regions\nof what would otherwise be unbounded\nspaces. The outer boundaries are then\nartificial, introduced only to limit the\ndomains of the numerical solutions. The\nconditions at such artificial boundaries\ncan cause numerical instabilities that\ndegrade the computed solutions.\nThe solution of the semidiscrete\napproximation requires an extrapolation\nof the difference equation at the boundary where the boundary condition is not\nspecified for the partial differential equation. This requires a numerical-boundary-condition scheme. The improper\ntreatment of the numerical boundary\nconditions can cause numerical instability even though the semidiscrete approximation is stable for the pure initial-value\nor Cauchy problem.\nThis work was done by Robert F.\n94\n\nWarming and Richard M. Beam of Ames\nResearch Center. To obtain a copy of\nthe report, \xc2\xb7Stability of Semidiscrete\nApproximations for Hyperbolic InitialBoundary- Value Problems: Stationary\nModes, n write in 21 on the TSP Request\nCard. ARC-12265\n\nFinite-Element Modeling\nfor Structural Analysis\nA report presents a study of finite-element mathematical modeling as used in\nanalyzing stresses and strains at joints\nbetween thin, shell-like components\n(e.g., ducts) and thicker components\n(e.g. , flanges or engine blocks). As a\nresult of the study, two basic approaches were suggested for determining correct values of stresses and strains. The\nfirst approach is to use a global/local\nmodel to evaluate the system. This provides the correct total response and a\ncorrect representation of stresses away\nfrom any discontinuities. The global\nmodel involves a coarse computational\nmesh; to minimize the cost of computation, finer meshes are used only to compute responses in local regions of interest. The second approach involves the\ndevelopment of special transition finite\nelements to model the transitions\nbetween shells and thicker structural\ncomponents.\nThis work was done by J. B. Min and\nS. G. Androlake for Marshall Space\nFlight Center. To obtain a copy of the\nreport, "An Assessment of FiniteBement Modeling Techniques for ThickSolidlThin-Shell Joints Analysis," write\nin 82 on the TSP Request Card.\nMFS-28971\n\nCo.; and Brian Daun and Gene Davis of\nRECOM Technologies.

The\nsensors exhibit fast drift, which results in\na short calibration period that is not suitable for Spacelab. By assessing the\ncomplete process of determining the\ntotal drift range available, the calibration\nprocedure was modified to eliminate\nerrors and still satisfy requirements without compromising the integrity of the\nsystem. The calibration period was\nextended from 32 days to over 90 days.\nThe modified procedure involves bench\ncalibration rather than expensive late\nmission-flow processing.\nThis work was done by David W\nYount and Kevin Heronimus of\nMcDonnell Douglas Aerospace for\nMarshall Space Flight Center.

The system is\nbased on machine learning as a means\nof improving scheduling. The system is\ndesigned to learn when to change its\nsearch strategy by analyzing its search\nprogress and learning the general conditions under which a resource bottleneck\nis likely to occur.\nThis work was done by Monte\nZweben and Megan Eskey of Ames\nResearch Center; Todd Stock, Will\nTaylor, Bob Kanefsky, and Ellen Drascher\nof Sterling Software; Michael Deale of\nLockheed Engineering and Sciences\n\nA report presents additional discussion of a technique for measuring the\ninterfacial tension between two immiscible liquids. The technique was described\nin "Measuring Interfacial Tension\nBetween Immiscible Liquids" (LEW15855), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 19, No.\n1 (January, 1995), page 60.\nThis work was done by Nasser\nRashidnia\nof NYMA,\nInc.;\nR.\nBalasubramaniam of Case Western\nReserve University; and David M.
