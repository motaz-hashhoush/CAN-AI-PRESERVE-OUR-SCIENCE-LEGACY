Some limitations in this technique still exist which can be alleviated with multiplex gas chromatography (MGC). In MGC, rapid multiple sample injections are made into the column without having to wait for one determination to be finished before taking a new sample. The resulting data must then be reduced using computational methods such as cross correlation. In order to efficiently perform multiplexgas chromatography, experiments in the laboratory and on board future space craft, skills, equipment, and computer software were developed. Three new techniques for modulating, i.e., changing, sample concentrations were demonstrated by using desorption, decomposition, and catalytic modulators. In all of them, the need for a separate gas stream as the carrier was avoided by placing the modulator at the head of the column to directly modulate a sample stream. Finally, the analysis of an environmental sample by multiplex chromatography was accomplished by employing silver oxide to catalytically modulate methane in ambient air.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850009788, "id": "f3b4e64d89e649c7a298b3d042584493", "publicationDate": "1985-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19850009788.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19850009788/downloads/19850009788.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19850009788/downloads/19850009788.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19850009788/downloads/19850009788.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
