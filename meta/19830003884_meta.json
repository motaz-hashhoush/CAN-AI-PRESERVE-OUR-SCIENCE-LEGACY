The program, which is called COSAM (Conservation of Strategic Aerospace Materials), has three general objectives. The first objective is to contribute basic scientific understanding to the turbine engine technology bank so that our national security is not jeopardized if our strategic material supply lines are disrupted. The second objective is to help reduce the dependence of United States military and civilian gas turbine engines on worldwide supply and price fluctuations in regard to strategic materials. The third objective is, through research, to contribute to the United States position of preeminence in the world gas turbine engine markets by minimizing the acquisition costs and optimizing the performance of gas turbine engines. Three major research thrusts are planned: strategic element substitution; advanced processing concepts; and alternate material identification. Results from research and any required supporting technology will give industry the materials technology options it needs to make tradeoffs in material properties for critical components against the cost and availability impacts related to their strategic metal content.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 19830003884, "endDate": "1982-11-17T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "68603dff261e5d2d9de5a550aa9e6b30", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "977cb5e25468412ba68abf3a93fe4d56", "id": "6f6b814f60d24b7e85450b2890f6d00c"}, {"organizationId": "71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "977cb5e25468412ba68abf3a93fe4d56", "id": "50e41af5c6e54ad7b2d734974b51c80e"}], "name": "Advanced Materials Technology Seminar", "location": "Hampton, VA", "id": "977cb5e25468412ba68abf3a93fe4d56", "startDate": "1982-11-16T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"volume": "NASA/CP-2251", "submissionId": 19830003884, "publisher": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "id": "5f12c030c42d4e749bb054bb93caa3ea", "publicationName": "Advanced Materials Technology", "publicationDate": "1982-11-16T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "issuePublicationDate": "1982-11-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19830003877, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Advanced Materials Technology", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830003884.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830003884/downloads/19830003884.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830003884/downloads/19830003884.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830003884/downloads/19830003884.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
