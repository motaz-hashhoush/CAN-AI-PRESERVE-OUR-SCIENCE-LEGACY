Groundwater\n\n16\xc2\xa0\n\nstorage (GWS) anomalies (relative to the long-term mean) exhibit strong seasonality, with\n\n17\xc2\xa0\n\nannual maxima observed during the monsoon season and minima during pre-monsoon season.\n\n18\xc2\xa0\n\nSpatial variability of GWS anomalies increases with the extent of measurements, following the\n\n19\xc2\xa0\n\npower law relationship, i.e., log-(spatial variability) is linearly dependent on log-(spatial extent).\n\n20\xc2\xa0\n\nIn addition, the impact of well spacing on spatial variability and the power law relationship is\n\n21\xc2\xa0\n\ninvestigated. We found that the mean GWS anomaly sampled at a 0.25 degree grid scale closes\n\n22\xc2\xa0\n\nto unweighted average over all wells. The absolute error corresponding to each basin grows\n\n23\xc2\xa0\n\nwith increasing scale, i.e., from 0.25 degree to 1 degree. It was observed that small changes in\n\n24\xc2\xa0\n\nextent could create very large changes in spatial variability at large grid scales.\xc2\xa0Spatial\n\n25\xc2\xa0\n\nvariability of GWS anomaly has been found to vary with climatic conditions. To our knowledge,\n\n26\xc2\xa0\n\nthis is the first study of the effects of well spacing on groundwater spatial variability. The results\n\n27\xc2\xa0\n\nmay be useful for interpreting large scale groundwater variations from unevenly spaced or\n\n28\xc2\xa0\n\nsparse groundwater well observations or for siting and prioritizing wells in a network for\n\n29\xc2\xa0\n\ngroundwater management. The output of this study could be used to maintain a cost effective\n\n30\xc2\xa0\n\ngroundwater monitoring network in the study region and the approach can also be used in other\n\n31\xc2\xa0\n\nparts of the globe.\n\n32\xc2\xa0\n\nKeywords: Groundwater, India, Groundwater spatial variability, Groundwater monitoring\n\n33\xc2\xa0\n\nnetwork design\n\n34\xc2\xa0\n\nHighlights (within 85 characters):\n\n35\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3907 in-situ groundwater observation wells are used to compute spatial variability\n\n36\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFirst study of spatial variability of groundwater storage affected by well spacing\n\n37\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSpatial variability of groundwater storage increases with increasing spatial extent\n\n38\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe output could be used to design cost-effective groundwater monitoring network\n\n39\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLog-linear relationship exists between groundwater spatial variability and extent\n\n40\xc2\xa0\n41\xc2\xa0\n\nGroundwater is a vital fresh water resource that is vulnerable to climate change and\n\n42\xc2\xa0\n\nunsustainable rates of extraction (e.g., Wada et al., 2010; Famiglietti and Rodell, 2013; Taylor et\n\n43\xc2\xa0\n\nal., 2013). Globally, about 38% of the irrigated land area are fed using groundwater resources\n\n44\xc2\xa0\n\n(Siebert et al., 2010). Recent studies have detected rapid depletion of groundwater resources in\n\n45\xc2\xa0\n\nmany parts of the world using satellite observations (Rodell et al., 2009; Voss et al., 2013; Richie\n\n46\xc2\xa0\n\net al., 2015).\n\n47\xc2\xa0\n\nSpatial variability of soil moisture has been extensively studied (Famiglietti et al., 2008;\n\n48\xc2\xa0\n\nBrocca et al., 2012; Li and Rodell, 2013) and has been found to increase with increasing extent\n\n49\xc2\xa0\n\n(the length scale of the major river basins within the study region) (Western and Bl\xc3\xb6sch, 1999),\n\n50\xc2\xa0\n\nfollowing the power law relationship. Few studies have been conducted on groundwater spatial\n\n51\xc2\xa0\n\nvariability owing to the scarcity of available, high quality measurement time-series at regional\n\n52\xc2\xa0\n\nscales. Inadequate information on sub-surface properties such as specific yield, which is required\n\n53\xc2\xa0\n\nto convert water table measurements to water storage, also complicates such analyses. Li et al.\n\n54\xc2\xa0\n\n(2015) studied groundwater storage variability using data from 181 monitoring wells in the\n\n55\xc2\xa0\n\ncentral and northeastern U.S and found that the spatial variability of groundwater storage\n\n56\xc2\xa0\n\nanomalies follow the power law relationship. However, observation wells in that study were\n\n57\xc2\xa0\n\nsparse in some areas and sampled only at a small range of climate conditions.\n\n58\xc2\xa0\n\nStudying groundwater variability across scales may benefit efforts to evaluate and\n\n59\xc2\xa0\n\ninterpret remote sensing based estimates and to improve numerical models, and also to better\n\n60\xc2\xa0\n\npredict groundwater responses to climate change and anthropogenic impacts (Taylor et al.,\n\n61\xc2\xa0\n\n2013). Further, groundwater variability scaling information could be used to improve\n\n62\xc2\xa0\n\ncomparisons between point-scale and remote sensing estimates. The Gravity Recovery and\n\n63\xc2\xa0\n\nClimate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations have proven useful for evaluating\n\n64\xc2\xa0\n\ngroundwater variations and trends at regional scales (e.g., Rodell et al., 2007). GRACE data\n\n65\xc2\xa0\n\nassimilation enables spatial, temporal, and vertical partitioning of GRACE TWS observations\n\n66\xc2\xa0\n\nusing an ensemble Kalman smoother approach (Zaitchik et al., 2008), but it is limited by the\n\n67\xc2\xa0\n\nfidelity of the land surface model and the accuracy of the meteorological forcing inputs. In\n\n68\xc2\xa0\n\nparticular, models currently used for GRACE data assimilation, are representing hydrogeological\n\n69\xc2\xa0\n\nprocesses in a rudimentary fashion and do not account for human interactions. Improved\n\n70\xc2\xa0\n\nunderstanding of groundwater dynamics and how they vary with scale may be useful for\n\n71\xc2\xa0\n\ninterpreting large scale groundwater variations from unevenly spaced or sparse groundwater well\n\n72\xc2\xa0\n\nobservations, for siting and prioritizing wells in a network for groundwater management, and for\n\n73\xc2\xa0\n\nidentifying environmental controls on groundwater (Li et al., 2015).\n\n74\xc2\xa0\n\nIn this study, we examined temporal and spatial groundwater storage anomaly variability\n\n75\xc2\xa0\n\nwithin 22 major river basins in India. A dense monitoring network of over 3900 observation\n\n76\xc2\xa0\n\nwells was used to study the dependency of groundwater storage variability on both extent and\n\n77\xc2\xa0\n\nspacing, the two components of the scale triplet (Western and Bl\xc3\xb6sch, 1999). Extent describes\n\n78\xc2\xa0\n\nthe spatial scale of a study area and spacing refers to the distance between the two observations\n\n79\xc2\xa0\n\n(Western and Bl\xc3\xb6sch, 1999). To our knowledge, this is the first study of the effects of well\n\n80\xc2\xa0\n\nspacing on groundwater spatial variability.\n\n81\xc2\xa0\n\n2 Data and Methods\n\n82\xc2\xa0\n\n2.1 Study area\n\n83\xc2\xa0\n\nIndia is comprised of 22 major river basins (Figure 1 and Table 1), based on India-WRIS\n\n84\xc2\xa0\n\n(2012). The Ganges river basin (basin 2a) is the largest, with an area of 808,334 km2, and the\n\n85\xc2\xa0\n\nbasin 16 is the smallest with an area of 10,345 km2 (Table 1). The hydrogeological settings of the\n\n86\xc2\xa0\n\nriver-basins are highly heterogeneous. For example, major parts of the Ganges basin has\n\n87\xc2\xa0\n\ncomprised of highly conducive, fluvial sediments, while, some parts of southern and western\n\n88\xc2\xa0\n\nGanges basin, has comprised of less conducive, volcanic and crystalline materials (Mukherjee et\n\n89\xc2\xa0\n\nal., 2015; Bhanja et al., 2016). Annual precipitation rate (averaged over 1962 and 2011) in the\n\n90\xc2\xa0\n\nentire country is 1083 mm/year (WBA, 2015) but varies considerably, with extremely low\n\n91\xc2\xa0\n\nprecipitation (<150 mm/year) observed in the western part of the country, and high precipitation\n\n92\xc2\xa0\n\n(>2500 mm/year) in the east (Mukherjee et al., 2015). At the basin scale, the maximum and\n\n93\xc2\xa0\n\nminimum precipitation occur in the basin 2c (2759 mm/year) and the Indus basin (basin 1; 545\n\n94\xc2\xa0\n\nmm/year), respectively.\n\n95\xc2\xa0\n\n2.2 Groundwater level measurement\n\n96\xc2\xa0\n\nSeasonal (during January, May, August and November, respectively) groundwater level\n\n97\xc2\xa0\n\nmeasurement data were obtained from a dense network of groundwater observation wells\n\n98\xc2\xa0\n\n(>13,000) maintained by India\xe2\x80\x99s Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) between 2005 and 2013.\n\n99\xc2\xa0\n\nMore than 85% of these wells are located in unconfined aquifers (CGWB, 2014). The quarterly\n\n100\xc2\xa0\n\nwater level measurements are representing groundwater level scenario in different season such\n\n101\xc2\xa0\n\nas, measurements in January and November represent post-monsoon water level, that in May\n\n102\xc2\xa0\n\nrepresents pre-monsoon and measurement in August represent monsoon-time water level. 3907\n\n103\xc2\xa0\n\nwells were selected for this study based on their temporal continuity and seasonality.\n\n104\xc2\xa0\n\nThe sign of groundwater level depths are reversed in order to represent groundwater\n\n105\xc2\xa0\n\nlevel. Subsequently; groundwater level anomalies (GWLA) were calculated after removing long-\n\n106\xc2\xa0\n\nterm mean values from its individual values in each of the selected wells. In order to get time\n\n107\xc2\xa0\n\nseries of groundwater storage (GWS) anomaly, GWLA values were multiplied by specific yield.\n\n108\xc2\xa0\n\nAquifer specific yield (Sy) values were obtained from the CGWB database (CGWB, 2012a),\n\n109\xc2\xa0\n\nwhich was constructed from long term pumping test results, and assigned to wells based on\n\n110\xc2\xa0\n\naquifer characteristics (Mukherjee et al., 2015) and other available information (i.e. map of\n\n111\xc2\xa0\n\naquifer systems of India) from CGWB (CGWB, 2012b). The mean Sy values ranged from 0.02\n\n112\xc2\xa0\n\nand 0.13 within the study area. The average depth to water in all the basins varies from 2 to 9 m\n\n113\xc2\xa0\n\nbelow ground surface. The deepest groundwater table is in the Indus basin (basin 1), where\n\n114\xc2\xa0\n\nlowest precipitation rate has been observed, and the shallowest is in basin 2c, where precipitation\n\n115\xc2\xa0\n\nrate is found to be the highest within all the basins (Table 1).\n\n116\xc2\xa0\n\nSince the observational network is dense, we designed three additional sampling schemes\n\n117\xc2\xa0\n\nto study how well spacing may affect groundwater spatial variability and also to study their scale\n\n118\xc2\xa0\n\ndependency. Figure 2 shows the well locations that are used at the 0.25 degree, 0.5 degree, and 1\n\n119\xc2\xa0\n\ndegree resolution, respectively. The well closest to each grid center was selected and the rest are\n\n120\xc2\xa0\n\ndiscarded. In between three spatial resolutions, well spacing is lowest in 0.25 degree and highest\n\n121\xc2\xa0\n\nin 1 degree scale. For example, considering all the wells used in our study at all the three spatial\n\n122\xc2\xa0\n\nresolutions, and total geographical area, well spacing is 1 well per 1671 km2 (0.25 degree), 1\n\n123\xc2\xa0\n\nwell per 4026 km2, or 1 well per 12253 km2 on average (Figure 2).\n\n124\xc2\xa0\n\n2.3 Precipitation data\n\n125\xc2\xa0\n\nWe used precipitation data from the archives of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission\n\n126\xc2\xa0\n\n(TRMM), a joint satellite mission of NASA and JAXA (Kummerow et al., 2000). In particular,\n\n127\xc2\xa0\n\nthe monthly gridded (0.250 \xc3\x97 0.250) 3B43 product, version 7, was used here. This product\n\n128\xc2\xa0\n\ncombines satellite retrievals with rain gauge data from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre\n\n129\xc2\xa0\n\n(GPCC). To be consistent with groundwater measurements, seasonal precipitation was calculated\n\n130\xc2\xa0\n\nfor the four time-periods: December-January, February-May, June-August and September-\n\n131\xc2\xa0\n\nNovember.\n\n132\xc2\xa0\n\n2.4 Scale dependency\n\n133\xc2\xa0\n\nInformation on scale dependency can be useful for designing effective ground-based\n\n134\xc2\xa0\n\nmonitoring networks and for upscaling point measurements. Earlier studies on soil moisture\n\n135\xc2\xa0\n\n(Famiglietti et al., 2008; Li and Rodell, 2013) and groundwater (Li et al., 2015), have shown that\n\n136\xc2\xa0\n\nspatial variability increases as a power function of extent, which can be described as a linear\n\n137\xc2\xa0\n\nfunction when log transformation is applied (Li et al., 2015):\n\n138\xc2\xa0\n\nlog(\xef\x81\xb3y) = Hlog(\xef\x81\xac) + C\n\n139\xc2\xa0\n\nwhere, \xef\x81\xb3y is the spatial variability at extent \xef\x81\xac, H and C are the slope and intercept of the\n\n140\xc2\xa0\n\nlinear relationship between log-(spatial variability) and log-extent, respectively.\nThe power law relationship can be used to estimate sampling sizes for desired accuracies\n\n141\xc2\xa0\n142\xc2\xa0\n\n(1)\n\nin a region (river basin here) using this equation (Wang et al., 2008; Li et al., 2015):\n\n143\xc2\xa0\n\nN = t21-(\xce\xb1/2),N-1 (\xef\x81\xb32)/(d2)\n\n144\xc2\xa0\n\nwhere, N is the number of samples, \xef\x81\xb3 is the spatial variability, d is the desired accuracy\n\n(2)\n\n145\xc2\xa0\n\n(absolute error), t21-(\xce\xb1/2),N-1 is the Student's t-distribution at the significance level \xce\xb1 (5% used\n\n146\xc2\xa0\n\nhere). Since N is unknown initially, we used an iterative method to estimate N (Wang et al.,\n\n147\xc2\xa0\n\n2008).\n\n148\xc2\xa0\n149\xc2\xa0\n\n150\xc2\xa0\n\n151\xc2\xa0\n\nCombining equations 1 and 2, we obtain the following equation to calculate the samples\nneeded for any region:\nN = t21-(\xce\xb1/2),N-1 (e2c\xef\x81\xac2H)/(d2)\n\n(3)\n\n3 Results\n\n152\xc2\xa0\n\n3.1 Spatial mean and variability\n\n153\xc2\xa0\n\nTime-series of groundwater storage anomalies, spatial variability (represented by spatial\n\n154\xc2\xa0\n\nstandard deviation) and precipitation are shown in Figure 3. Major parts of the northern and\n\n155\xc2\xa0\n\ncentral India were subjected to drought in 2009-10 (NCC, 2013), consequently, GWS anomalies\n\n156\xc2\xa0\n\nhave also exhibited lowest values in 2009-10 (e.g., in basins 1, 2a, 2b, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and\n\n157\xc2\xa0\n\n20). India, the country as a whole (except the southern region), receives the maximum\n\n158\xc2\xa0\n\nprecipitation during the monsoon season (June to September) (NCC, 2013). On the other hand,\n\n159\xc2\xa0\n\nthe monsoon season extends to October, sometimes even to November, in the southern part of\n\n160\xc2\xa0\n\nthe country (NCC, 2013). The characteristics of temporal pattern of precipitation are also\n\n161\xc2\xa0\n\nreflected in the seasonal GWS anomalies (Figure 3). Maximum GWS anomalies are observed\n\n162\xc2\xa0\n\nduring the monsoon period in basins 1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 20, and\n\n163\xc2\xa0\n\nimmediately after the monsoon in basins 3, 4, 5, 9, 15, 16, and 17 that are located in the southern\n\n164\xc2\xa0\n\nIndia. GWS minima are observed during the pre-monsoon period in all the basins.\n\n165\xc2\xa0\n\nSpatial variability of GWS anomalies, in terms of standard deviation, is shown in Figure\n\n166\xc2\xa0\n\n3. The relationship between spatial variability and groundwater storage anomaly is further\n\n167\xc2\xa0\n\ninvestigated through Figure 4. Spatial variability show increasing trend with increasing mean\n\n168\xc2\xa0\n\nGWS anomaly in most of the basins, 1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 20,\n\n169\xc2\xa0\n\nrespectively. We observe an upward concave relationship between spatial variability and mean\n\n170\xc2\xa0\n\nGWS anomaly in the above mentioned basins (Figure 4).\n\n171\xc2\xa0\n\n3.2 Scale dependency\n\n172\xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 5a shows the relationship between log-(spatial variability) and log-extent for all\n\n173\xc2\xa0\n\nthe basins. Here the extent of each basin was estimated as the square root of the basin area (Table\n\n174\xc2\xa0\n\n1) following Famiglietti et al. (2008) and Li et al. (2015). Here, spatial variability was obtained\n\n175\xc2\xa0\n\nby taking mean of all standard deviations of all seasons. Log-(spatial variability) increases\n\n176\xc2\xa0\n\nlinearly (significant at the 0.1 level) with the log-(extent). Some of the data points are located far\n\n177\xc2\xa0\n\naway from the best fitted line. This might be a result of dynamic variability of GWS anomaly\n\n178\xc2\xa0\n\nacross the basins, heterogeneous aquifer hydrogeological properties, or heterogeneous patterns of\n\n179\xc2\xa0\n\ngroundwater usage in different basins. Influence of dynamic range differences are eliminated by\n\n180\xc2\xa0\n\ncomputing normalized standard deviation as described by Li et al. (2015) (Figure 5a). Spatial\n\n181\xc2\xa0\n\nvariability was standardized using temporal standard deviations over all wells. However, we\n\n182\xc2\xa0\n\nfound insignificant increase with near-zero slope (0.02) in the log-log graph (Figure 5a).\n\n183\xc2\xa0\n\nThe linear relationship between log-(spatial variability of specific yield) and log-extent\n\n184\xc2\xa0\n\n(Figure 5b) is insignificant. However, log (spatial variability of precipitation) increases linearly\n\n185\xc2\xa0\n\n(significant with p value < 0.05) with log-extent (Figure 5c). These combine results suggest that\n\n186\xc2\xa0\n\nGWS spatial variability is influenced more by climate than by aquifer properties.\n\n187\xc2\xa0\n\nEquation 2 assumes data are normally distributed, which can be tested using the statistical\n\n188\xc2\xa0\n\nproperties of the data. Figure 6 shows distribution of GWS anomaly within 4 largest basins,\n\n189\xc2\xa0\n\nGWS anomaly follows similar distribution in other basins. The thickness of the box indicates the\n\n190\xc2\xa0\n\ninter-quartile range (25 to 75th percentile) of the data; horizontal line within the box specify\n\n191\xc2\xa0\n\nmedian values; black filled circles inside the box shows mean values; upper and lower limits of\n\n192\xc2\xa0\n\nwhisker indicate \xc2\xb11 \xef\x81\xb3 deviation from the mean; top and down black filled stars showing 99%\n\n193\xc2\xa0\n\nand 1% data, respectively. In general, we observe characteristics of normal distribution in GWS\n\n194\xc2\xa0\n\nanomaly in all the basins: mean and median GWS anomaly values closely follow each other\n\n195\xc2\xa0\n\n(Figure 6); the inter-quartile range (50% of the data lies between 25% and 75%) is well within 1-\n\n196\xc2\xa0\n\n\xef\x81\xb3 values (Figure 6). The solutions of Equation (3), for different levels of accuracy, are plotted in\n\n197\xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 7. The number of wells increase with increasing extent for an absolute error level. The\n\n198\xc2\xa0\n\nnumber of wells used within each studied basin vs. their extent are also plotted. It is found that\n\n199\xc2\xa0\n\nthe absolute error level is smallest (less than 0.5 cm) in basins 2a and 4, which contains\n\n200\xc2\xa0\n\ncomparatively higher number of wells, and largest (more than 2.0 cm) in basin 2c, which\n\n201\xc2\xa0\n\ncontains only six wells. 9 basins (basin 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5, 8, 14, 18, and 20) exhibit absolute error\n\n202\xc2\xa0\n\nlevels less than 1 cm. Absolute error levels of the basins studied here were lower than those of\n\n203\xc2\xa0\n\nthe regions studied by Li et al. (2015) due to the greater density of CGWB\xe2\x80\x99s Indian groundwater\n\n204\xc2\xa0\n\nlevel network.\n\n205\xc2\xa0\n\n4 Discussions\n\n206\xc2\xa0\n\n4.1 Spatial variability in groundwater storage anomaly\n\n207\xc2\xa0\n\nSpatial variability of GWS anomalies can be attributed to several factors including non-\n\n208\xc2\xa0\n\nuniformities of precipitation, groundwater withdrawals, hydrogeological properties, and\n\n209\xc2\xa0\n\ngroundwater discharge. Temporal variability of GWS anomalies is linked with seasonal\n\n210\xc2\xa0\n\nprecipitation and subsequent hydrological processes (Li et al., 2015). We observed an upward\n\n211\xc2\xa0\n\nconcave relationship between spatial variability and mean GWS anomaly (also observed by Li et\n\n212\xc2\xa0\n\nal., 2015), unlike the upward convex relationship observed in soil-moisture studies (Owe et al.,\n\n213\xc2\xa0\n\n1982; Famiglietti et al., 2008; Rosenbaum et al., 2012). Although soil physical processes control\n\n214\xc2\xa0\n\nthe convexity of the standard deviation vs. mean soil moisture curve, the lower and upper bounds\n\n215\xc2\xa0\n\nof the curve are entirely dependent upon the saturation capacity of the soil, which will show less\n\n216\xc2\xa0\n\nvariation once it reaches its limit (Li and Rodell, 2013). On the other hand, unconfined\n\n217\xc2\xa0\n\ngroundwater storage rarely has any hard limits and hence, GWS variability is not restricted to\n\n218\xc2\xa0\n\nany boundary conditions (Li et al., 2015). As the magnitude of GWS is highly variable in space,\n\n219\xc2\xa0\n\nspatial variability is more likely to be higher during GWS extremes (Li et al., 2015).\n\n220\xc2\xa0\n\nThe upward concave relationship is less obvious or non-existent in certain basins (e.g., 5,\n\n221\xc2\xa0\n\n17, 19). In those basins the mean GWS anomaly rarely exceeded a magnitude of 5 cm, which is\n\n222\xc2\xa0\n\nwhen the increase in standard deviation became evident in other basins. These smaller anomalies\n\n223\xc2\xa0\n\nmay be explained by the fact that, in southern India, moderate rainfall occurs during the post-\n\n224\xc2\xa0\n\nmonsoon period unlike the other parts of the country. As a result, GWS is less variable\n\n225\xc2\xa0\n\nthroughout the year in southern India.\n\n226\xc2\xa0\n\nObservation of very small insignificant slope in the log-log graph of normalized standard\n\n227\xc2\xa0\n\ndeviation vs. extent, suggesting climate-related temporal variability of groundwater is the\n\n228\xc2\xa0\n\ndominant factor controlling differences in spatial variability in India. Normalized standard\n\n229\xc2\xa0\n\ndeviation reflects the difference in the seasonal variation of groundwater storage anomalies at\n\n230\xc2\xa0\n\ndifferent wells. As the data were sampled at only four times a year, the temporal variation of the\n\n231\xc2\xa0\n\nseasonality was not well captured. On the other hand, groundwater storage may indeed vary in\n\n232\xc2\xa0\n\nstrong synchronization due to the impact of monsoons in most regions. Groundwater spatial\n\n233\xc2\xa0\n\nvariability in India may be strongly influenced by climate (such as annual precipitation) than by\n\n234\xc2\xa0\n\nother factors such as natural groundwater discharge etc.\n\n235\xc2\xa0\n\n4.2 Effect of well spacing across different spatial scales\n\n236\xc2\xa0\n\nTo investigate the effect of different sampling spacing on the scale dependency, we\n\n237\xc2\xa0\n\nplotted the logarithm of spatial variability against logarithm of extent for the three sampling\n\n238\xc2\xa0\n\nschemes mentioned earlier (Figure 8). Statistically significant (p values < 0.05) increasing linear\n\n239\xc2\xa0\n\nrelationship has been observed between logarithm of spatial variability against logarithm of\n\n240\xc2\xa0\n\nextent similar to that derived based on all data (all the wells present within each basin are used,\n\n241\xc2\xa0\n\nno spatial scaling are done). The slope of linear relationship increases with decreasing well\n\n242\xc2\xa0\n\nspacing (Table 2), similar to observation of Li and Rodell (2013) for soil moisture observations.\n\n243\xc2\xa0\n\nThus, spatial variability increases rapidly with increasing extent for increasing well spacing.\n\n244\xc2\xa0\n\nHence, the effect of change in extent on spatial variability has been reduced with increasing\n\n245\xc2\xa0\n\nspatial scales, as we observed very large change in spatial variability for smaller change in extent\n\n246\xc2\xa0\n\nat larger well spacing i.e. data at 1 degree-scale (Figure 8c).\n\n247\xc2\xa0\n\nSlope and intercept values (Table 2) at 0.25, 0.5 and 1 degree-scale, were further used in\n\n248\xc2\xa0\n\nEquation (3), subsequently, the solutions are plotted in Figure 9. The number of representative\n\n249\xc2\xa0\n\nwells required to maintain a good groundwater monitoring network has been increasing with\n\n250\xc2\xa0\n\nincreasing spatial extent in a particular absolute error level for all the spatial scales. The number\n\n251\xc2\xa0\n\nof wells (Table 1) used in different spatial scale for each basin against their extent are also\n\n252\xc2\xa0\n\nplotted in Figure 9. The number of wells are decreasing with increasing spatial scale i.e. between\n\n253\xc2\xa0\n\n0.25 and 1 degree; highest number of wells were used in 0.25 degree-scale comparing all the\n\n254\xc2\xa0\n\nscales. Slope and intercept obtained through Figure 9, are mainly used for calculation of absolute\n\n255\xc2\xa0\n\nerror levels using Equation (3). The absolute errors at 0.25 degree-scale closely matches with\n\n256\xc2\xa0\n\nthat for all data (Figure 7 and 9a). Similar to absolute errors for all data, only one basin (basin\n\n257\xc2\xa0\n\n2c) exhibit more than 2 cm absolute error, and 8 basins (out of 9 basins for all data) show errors\n\n258\xc2\xa0\n\nless than 1 cm. Absolute error level increases at 0.5 degree-scale (absolute error level higher than\n\n259\xc2\xa0\n\n2 cm in 6 basins) and showing highest values at 1 degree-scale (absolute error level higher than 2\n\n260\xc2\xa0\n\ncm in 12 basins) (Figure 9b and 9c). Only one basin (basin 4) exhibit absolute error level less\n\n261\xc2\xa0\n\nthan 1.5 cm and 9 other basins exhibit less than 2 cm absolute error levels at 1 degree-scale\n\n262\xc2\xa0\n\n(Figure 9c). We found an increase in absolute error level with increasing spatial scales, i.e., from\n\n263\xc2\xa0\n\n0.25 degree to 1 degree.\n\n264\xc2\xa0\n\nAmong the three different spatial scales (e.g., 0.25 degree, 0.5 degree and 1 degree-\n\n265\xc2\xa0\n\nscale), mean GWS anomaly at 0.25 degree spatial scale matches closely with mean values in all\n\n266\xc2\xa0\n\nwells and the distant matches has been observed at 1 degree-scale. The absolute error in GWS\n\n267\xc2\xa0\n\nanomaly also increases with increasing spatial scales (Figure 7 and 9). Although the desired\n\n268\xc2\xa0\n\naccuracy level depends on end-user's application, we recommend using finest available spatial-\n\n269\xc2\xa0\n\nscale for validating satellite retrievals, model validation etc.\n\n270\xc2\xa0\n\n4.3 Designing cost-effective groundwater monitoring network\n\n271\xc2\xa0\n\nThe output of this study can be used to design a cost-effective groundwater monitoring\n\n272\xc2\xa0\n\nnetwork within the study area. The end-user could pre-select the optimum error level and use our\n\n273\xc2\xa0\n\ndata to compute the minimum number of wells required to reach the accuracy level in the study\n\n274\xc2\xa0\n\narea. For example, assuming the end-user want to keep the absolute error level within 2 cm, they\n\n275\xc2\xa0\n\ncould only select the wells used for 1 degree well spacing (Figure 2c) in basins, 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 8,\n\n276\xc2\xa0\n\n12, 13, 14, 18, and 20 (Figure 9c). This will largely reduce the maintenance cost for establishing\n\n277\xc2\xa0\n\na well-defined groundwater monitoring network. This approach could also be applied in different\n\n278\xc2\xa0\n\nparts of the globe.\n\n279\xc2\xa0\n\n5 Conclusions\n\n280\xc2\xa0\n\nWe used seasonal groundwater level measurements at 3907 wells located in 22 major\n\n281\xc2\xa0\n\nriver basins in India to study spatio-temporal variability of groundwater storage (GWS)\n\n282\xc2\xa0\n\nanomalies. Three distinct spatial scales were used to examine the effects of well spacing on the\n\n283\xc2\xa0\n\nmean and variability of GWS anomalies. Our key findings include:\n\n284\xc2\xa0\n\n1. Spatial variability of groundwater storage anomalies are influenced by well spacing.\n\n285\xc2\xa0\n\n2. Spatial variability of GWS anomalies increases with increasing spatial extent at all\n\n286\xc2\xa0\n\n287\xc2\xa0\n288\xc2\xa0\n\n289\xc2\xa0\n290\xc2\xa0\n\n291\xc2\xa0\n292\xc2\xa0\n\n293\xc2\xa0\n\nspatial scales i.e. 0.25, 0.5 and 1 degree.\n3. The output of this study could be used to design cost-effective groundwater monitoring\nnetwork in the study region.\n4. A positive linear relationship does exist between the logarithm of GWS anomaly and\nthe logarithm of spatial extent.\n5. Spatial variability of GWS anomaly increases during the wettest (monsoon) and driest\n(pre-monsoon) periods of the year in most of the regions.\nOur study indicates that the uncertainty in regional GWS anomaly estimates based on\n\n294\xc2\xa0\n\ndata from the CGWB\xe2\x80\x99s well network is relatively low, owing to the high density of observations\n\n295\xc2\xa0\n\nin that network. Results of this study confirm previously inferred scaling behaviors of\n\n296\xc2\xa0\n\ngroundwater storage in the central and eastern U.S. (Li et al., 2015), demonstrating that those\n\n297\xc2\xa0\n\nbehaviors hold true in a region with a different climate and hydrogeology and with a vastly\n\n298\xc2\xa0\n\nincreased sampling density. These data could also be useful for validating satellite-based and\n\n299\xc2\xa0\n\nmodel-based estimates of groundwater variability in India and other regions with similar climatic\n\n300\xc2\xa0\n\nand hydrogeologic features.\n\n301\xc2\xa0\n302\xc2\xa0\n\nAcknowledgments and Data\nSNB acknowledges CSIR (Government of India) for their support for providing the SPM\n\n303\xc2\xa0\n\nfellowship.
