b'Life Cycle Analysis of Dedicated Nano-Launch Technologies\nEdgar Zapata1, Carey McCleskey2\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, Kennedy Space Center\nJohn Martin3, Roger Lepsch4, Tosoc Hernani5\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, Langley Research Center\nRecent technology advancements have enabled the development of small cheap satellites that can\nperform useful functions in the space environment. Currently, the only low cost option for getting these\npayloads into orbit is through ride share programs - small satellites awaiting the launch of a larger\nsatellite, and then riding along on the same launcher. As a result, these small satellite customers await\nprimary payload launches and a backlog exists. An alternative option would be dedicated nano-launch\nsystems built and operated to provide more flexible launch services, higher availability, and affordable\nprices. The potential customer base that would drive requirements or support a business case includes\ncommercial, academia, civil government and defense. Further, NASA technology investments could\nenable these alternative game changing options.\nWith this context, in 2013 the Game Changing Development (GCD) program funded a NASA team to\ninvestigate the feasibility of dedicated nano-satellite launch systems with a recurring cost of less than $2\nmillion per launch for a 5 kg payload to low Earth orbit. The team products would include potential\nconcepts, technologies and factors for enabling the ambitious cost goal, exploring the nature of the goal\nitself, and informing the GCD program technology investment decision making process.\nThis paper provides an overview of the life cycle analysis effort that was conducted in 2013 by an\ninter-center NASA team. This effort included the development of reference nano-launch system concepts,\ndeveloping analysis processes and models, establishing a basis for cost estimates (development,\nmanufacturing and launch) suitable to the scale of the systems, and especially, understanding the\nrelationship of potential game changing technologies to life cycle costs, as well as other factors, such as\nflights per year.\n\n1\n\nEdgar Zapata, NASA Kennedy Space Center, KSC FL.

Introduction\nIn February 2014, shortly after Phase I of the study documented here had concluded, the process began for\ndeploying 28 cubesats from the International Space Station6. These satellites from Planet-Labs, a customer of the\nInternational Space Station (ISS) NanoRacks CubeSats program, are part of an emerging trend in space systems \xe2\x80\x93\nsmall, but capable satellites filling a variety of needs. Private sector commercial business\xe2\x80\x99s, academic and scientific\nneeds, as well as government interests, NASA or defense, are discovering the potential of these \xe2\x80\x9cnanosats\xe2\x80\x9d, satellites\nof less than 10kg mass.\n\nFigure 1: The Japanese Kibo robotic arm on the International Space Station deploying Planet-Labs CubeSats\nIn the summer of 2013, an inter-center, inter-agency assessment was sponsored by the NASA Space Technology\nMission Directorate Game Changing program. The objectives were:\nx\nx\nx\n\nIdentify primary cost drivers for small launch vehicles (nano-small payload class, 5-100 kg)\nIdentify technology and concept opportunities to significantly reduce launch cost\nDetermine feasibility of achieving goal of < $2 M per launch recurring cost for a dedicated launch capability\n\nThe dollar goal was preliminary, a rough target, understanding that the assessment process would have many\nuncertainties, with the study emphasizing the direction for future technology investments by NASA that could benefit\nemerging nanolaunchers. These investments could assist the development of capabilities that would benefit NASA\nneeds as well. Other options already exist for getting small satellites to low Earth orbit (LEO), mainly ride share\nprograms, meaning nanosats being carried along as secondary payloads when launching primary payloads. And while\ncurrent rideshare launch prices are attractive to nanosat customers, the long contract-to-launch times (nominally 18\nmonths) and inherent constraints on orbital destinations are not. This proposed alternative approach is dedicated\nnano-satellite launch vehicles operated at an affordable price.\n\n2. Related Efforts\nOne of the first steps in the nanolauncher technology assessment was a review of other related efforts. Many\ngovernment, private sector and partnered initiatives are underway in this field of nanosats and nanolaunchers. The\nstudy was scoped to avoid any single point design, focusing on technology, affordability, and understanding the\npossibilities and drivers affecting target launch costs; this would distinguish this study from other related efforts.\n\n6\n\nLargest Flock of Earth-Imaging Satellites Launch into Orbit from Space Station,\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/flock_1/ (last visited May 19, 2014).\n\n2\n\nRelated government funded nanolauncher efforts (in order of decreasing payload size) include:\nx\n\nThe Super-Strypi program7 sponsored by the Defense department Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) office\nseeks to develop a launch system to exploit the 21st century range, including reduced infrastructure, using\ntechnology such as Automated Flight Safety Systems (AFSS), Global Positioning System (GPS) metric tracking,\nspace-based telemetry relay, and automated flight planning. Performance goals are for a 300 kilogram payload\nto a 475 km orbit at 45 degree inclination. The affordability goal is a $12-15M \xe2\x80\x9cfly-away\xe2\x80\x9d price as a commercial\nlaunch service.\n\nx\n\nThe Airborne-Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research\nProjects Agency (DARPA): \xe2\x80\x9cALASA seeks to launch satellites on the order of 100 pounds (45 kilogram) for\nless than $1M total, including range support costs, to orbits that are selected specifically for each 100 pound\npayload8.\xe2\x80\x9d This nanolauncher point design in the trade space of options places special emphasis on moving the\nlauncher away from traditional ground infrastructure, including launch site (especially \xe2\x80\x9crange\xe2\x80\x9d) requirements\nthat have evolved around larger launchers with significantly higher revenue. It would be impossible for a\nnanolauncher to achieve a price of $1M a launch if payments to the launch site range alone were that amount.\nAdditionally, meeting certain range requirements can create significant costs internal to a launcher organization,\nregardless of any payment (or reimbursable) to a range. In March 2014, Boeing was selected out of a three-way\ncompetition to demonstrate its concept9.\n\nx\n\nThe Soldier-Warfighter Operationally Responsive Deployer for Space (SWORDS) program sponsored by the\nU.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC): SWORDS is \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6an initiative to develop a low\ncost, responsive and robust space launch system for the U.S. Army to quickly launch and deploy\nnanosatellites10.\xe2\x80\x9d Eventually the concept would \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6launch 25 kilogram payload to 750-kilometer orbit with\n28.5 degrees inclination\xe2\x80\x9d for $1M a launch. This nanolauncher point design in the trade space of options lays\nspecial emphasis on the factor of manufacturing, parts costs, and systems complexity. \xe2\x80\x9cUltra-low cost is\nachieved by careful selection and judicious application of commercial-grade materials and components, as\nopposed to traditional aerospace-grade components.\xe2\x80\x9d As of this writing, 2014 work is focused on certain ground\nsystems and vehicle engine development.\n\nFigure 2: A sampling of government funded\n\nnanolauncher initiatives \xe2\x80\x93 SWORDS (left),\nORS/Super-Strypi (right).\n(Not to relative scales)\n\n7\n\nORS and Super-Strypi,\nhttp://cires.colorado.edu/events/lidarworkshop/LWG/Oct12/presentations/003-ORS Briefing to Lidar Winds Workshop-101612.pptx (last visited May 19, 2014).\n8\nALASA, http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/TTO/Programs/Airborne_Launch_Assist_Space_Access_%28ALASA%29.aspx\n(last visited May 19, 2014).\n9\nBoeing Targets 66 Percent Launch Cost Reduction with ALASA,\nhttp://www.spacenews.com/article/military-space/40023boeing-targets-66-percent-launch-cost-reduction-with-alasa\n(last visited May 19, 2014).\n10\nSWORDS, http://www.smdc.army.mil/FactSheets/SWORDS.pdf (last visited May 19, 2014).\n\n3\n\nx\n\nNASA is also encouraging the nanolauncher market (supply) by awarding a commercial launch services contract\n(demand) to Generation Orbit. Generation Orbit Launch Services, Inc. (GO) was selected to launch a group of\nthree 3U CubeSats to a 425 km orbit as an initial capability demonstration, potentially leading to additional\nlaunch contracts. The launch will \xe2\x80\x9cprovide a CubeSat-class launch via the NASA Launch Services Enabling\neXploration and Technology (NEXT) contract. NEXT is an element of a strategic initiative led by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nLaunch Services Program (LSP), focused on assuring long-term launch services while also promoting the\ncontinued evolution of the U.S. commercial space launch market.11\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nx\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cNano Launch 1200\xe2\x80\x9d program sponsored by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center: The \xe2\x80\x9c1200\xe2\x80\x9d refers to\ndollars in thousands. This project is focused on reducing \xe2\x80\x9cthe cost of launching a small payload or nanosat (110kg) to space\xe2\x80\x9d. Partnerships are critical in the approach, including the Air Force Research Laboratory on\ntechnology, NASA multi--center groups on avionics, Kennedy Space Center on ground operations and launch,\nand Goddard Space Flight Center on launch.\n\nThere are numerous nanolauncher initiatives in the private sector as well (with varying degrees of government\nsupport, as a potential customer, or with some form of partnering).

Nanosat Markets\nHaving defined broad objectives and reviewed related efforts, a necessary step toward understanding potential\nnanolaunchers begins with understanding their customers, the market of nanosats of all kinds. Two important factors\nhere appear to be price of entry and flexibility. In launch market parlance, a common metric of cost is \xe2\x80\x9ccost per\nkilogram\xe2\x80\x9d. While useful in the right contexts, transportation services to space cannot (yet) be procured by the pound.\nAs an analogy, the entire bolt of cloth must be purchased, not just a yard. Nonetheless, team members were aware\nthat smaller launcher size (measured by payload capability) would usually mean higher costs per kilogram.\n\nRecent US Launch Price Contracts 2012-2015\n(Logarithmic Scale)\n\n"Specific" Costs = $ per kg\n=$ Price/kg Payload Capability\n\n$1,000,000\ny = 665074x-0.396\n\n5 kg @\n$200K/kg =\nTarget\n\n$100,000\n\nPegasus\nScout\n\n$10,000\n\nAntares Shuttle Ref.

When plotting data this way, the\nnanolauncher cost objective could be taken as asking \xe2\x80\x9cdoes a point exist around 5 kilograms that does not exceed\n$200,000/kg\xe2\x80\x9d? Figure 3 would seem to indicate that extrapolating beyond Pegasus or Scout rockets would take a\n5kg payload into the general area of the cost objective \xe2\x80\x93 but improvements moving off the trend-line are required to\nmeet the target costs. There is insufficient data in the very small payload scale range to draw a definite conclusion, or\nextrapolation, other than to see both potential and challenge.\nSimilarly, points on Figure 3 that are well below the trend-line of the rest of the group could be taken as an\nindication of needed context. More fully \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial\xe2\x80\x9d systems (serving more non-government customers) could end\nup far lower on a cost per kg intercept at very small payload scales. This big picture view shows both the scope of\nthe challenge and the promise in considering the potential of technology and context for affordable, dedicated\nnanolaunchers.\n\n13\n\nThe raw data for this figure (Excel format) is available upon request. Contact the author at edgar.zapata-1@nasa.gov.\n\n5\n\nThis leads to specific customers in the market for a launcher (of any kind) for their smallsats. Currently,\nuniversities dominate the nanosat/cube-sat field. NASA is a principal player and market maker here, with its CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI14). To date, most CSLI awards have been to universities. The private sector smallsat/cube-sat field is also growing fast and even predicted to soon dominate the market15. This is as small-sats\ncontinue to offer an increasingly accessible, participatory technology.\nNotably, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to determine the future shape or bounds of a small/nanosat market seeing such innovation\nand entrepreneurial initiative, while attracting capital reaching into the tens of millions16,17. Business cases are\ninnovative as well, for example, where imagery may be a focus, but not the fundamental business case (the case may\nbe analytics18).\nA key takeaway from the review of the nanosat market information, affecting this study, is the reasonableness of\nconsidering flight rates that could assist in achieving price objectives, while also clarifying the question \xe2\x80\x93 what\xe2\x80\x99s in\nthe cost objective? The objective of $1M-$2M a launch would be a marginal cost then, related to flight rate as\nfollows:\nx\n\nCost objective: Amortizing fixed yearly costs (make or launch) over all units for the year plus the variable costs\nfor each unit (make or launch). This will also be referred to as the recurring launch cost.\no Fixed yearly costs are not considered to be incurred all at once at the start of the year, but may be\namortized over the rate of manufacture and launch.\no Variable costs are those costs incurred directly because of the make or launch of that additional unit.\no Amortization of upfront costs (e.g., development costs) is not included.\n\nAnother market factor informing this study (especially cost objectives) would be the current options for launch\navailable to nanosat customers. A benchmark on prices could be the SpaceX small satellite pricing goals of\n$200,000-325,000 for a PPOD (a Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer) and $4-5 million for an ESPA (an ELV\n(Expendable Launch Vehicle) Secondary Payload Adapter ring (which includes propulsion) 19.\nAlternately, companies such as NanoRacks with research platforms permanently installed on the U.S. National\nLaboratory aboard the International Space Station can charge much less for a launch through orbital delivery service.\nNanoRacks charges \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6by the 1U\xe2\x80\x93a 4 inch by 4 inch by 4 inch educational payload (1U) can be as low as $30,000.\nA 2U is twice that. A 2U by 1U is three times that. Commercial payloads start at $60,000 per 1U. 20\xe2\x80\x9d Charges are\nhigher for non-US payloads. NanoRacks takes advantage of excess delivery capacity on cargo flights to the station to\nprovide this service. Nonetheless, NanoRacks capability is currently limited by the rate of satellite deployments\npossible at the station. This gave rise once again to importance of flight rate going in to the study \xe2\x80\x93 breaking away\nfrom current launch service limitations and constraints \xe2\x80\x93 should competitive, dedicated nanolaunchers be realized.\n\n14\n\nNASA CubeSat Launch Initiative, http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/CubeSats_initiative.html\n(last visited May 19, 2014).\n15\nDominic DePascuale, John Bradford, \xe2\x80\x9cNano/Microsatellite Market Assessment\xe2\x80\x9d, February 2013,\nhttp://www.sei.aero/eng/papers/uploads/archive/SpaceWorks_NanoMicrosat_Market_Feb2013.pdf (last visited May 19, 2014).\n16\nAlex Konrad, \xe2\x80\x9cBillionaire Yuri Milner Just Poured Millions Into This Whiz Kid Satellite Startup,\xe2\x80\x9d Forbes, December 18,\n2013, http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/12/18/planet-labs-raises-52-million/ (last visited May 19, 2014).\n17\nPeter B de Selding, \xe2\x80\x9cSkybox Gets Creative To Raise Capital from Wary Investors\xe2\x80\x9d, SpaceNews, March 26, 2013\nhttp://www.spacenews.com/130326skybox-gets-creative-to-raise-capital-from-wary-investors (last visited May 19, 2014).\n18\nPlanet Labs advertises it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9canalytics platform\xe2\x80\x9d, appearing to break away from a traditional imagery business case, where a\n\xe2\x80\x9cglobal sensing and analytics platform unlocks the ability to understand and respond to change at a local and global scale\xe2\x80\x9d.\n19\nDustin Doud, Brian Bjelde, Chritain Melbostad, Lauren Dryer, \xe2\x80\x9cSecondary Launch Services and Payload Hosting Aboard the\nFalcon and Dragon Product Lines\xe2\x80\x9d, August 15, 2012, http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2012/all2012/40/ (last visited May\n19, 2014).\n20\nNanoRacks, http://nanoracks.com/resources/faq/ (last visited May 19, 2014).\n\n6\n\nFor benchmark purposes, cost objectives of private sector dedicated nanolaunchers efforts (Raytheon21,\nGeneration Orbit22) are at the million-dollar end of the range of prices, while other launchers (Interorbital) would be\non the far lower end (as little as $12,500 per 1u cubesat; and selling \xe2\x80\x9cby the yard\xe2\x80\x9d 23). All of this would inform the\nstudy going forward.\n\n4.\n\nRequirements\n\nHaving reviewed goals, related government and private sector efforts, emerging nanosat markets, and current\nnanosat launch options, the study defined more specific requirements (Figure 4) for the dedicated nanolauncher\ntrade space. In this short study the values that would be emphasized most would relate to payload (performance of\nthe nanolauncher), costs, and flight rates.\nA follow-up study in 2014 will delve into more of the detailed requirements, especially how requirements interact\nwith very specific technology investments, costs and flight rates.\n\nFigure 4: Top-level requirements established in the nanolauncher study.\n\n5. Assumptions\nA handful of assumptions were necessary for the study before models, tools and processes could explore the\nimplications of the dedicated nanolauncher cost and payload goal. These assumptions were:\nx\nx\n\nPayload capabilities would be maintained through vehicle resizing\nLauncher would assume a Poly Picosatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD) for all cubesat accommodations\no (These have deployed > 90% of all CubeSats to date; 100% of all CubeSats since 2006)\n\n21\n\nTurner Brinton, \xe2\x80\x9cRaytheon Developing $2M Small Sat Launcher To Fly Under Wing of F-15\xe2\x80\x9d, SpaceNews, August 8, 2011,\nhttp://www.spacenews.com/article/raytheon-developing-2m-small-sat-launcher-fly-under-wing-f-15 (last visited May 19, 2014).\n22\nNASA press release, http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/releases/2013/release-20130930.html\n(last visited May 19, 2014).\n23\nInterorbital, http://www.interorbital.com/interorbital_03302014_003.htm (last visited May 19, 2014).\n\n7\n\nx\n\nLauncher would assume standard payload accommodations as:\no No services, no customizing\no Akin to rideshare accommodations\no No trickle charging, spot purging or driving cleanliness requirements\n\n6. Assessment Process: Data\nThe assessment process required adapting existing models and tools, or developing these anew, capable of\nproviding confidence for new concepts at the small scale of nanolaunchers. The process would also research and\nestablish some baseline data for comparative purposes. This assortment of information would eventually include:\nx\nx\nx\n\nThe old Scout rocket, performance, costs, lessons, yearly flight rate experience\nSmall solid motor data, performance, prices\nMissile data, performance, prices, size of production lots\n\nThe Scout rocket proved particularly useful in lending insight. As a relatively small launcher, the scale was not\nsignificantly far from the scale some nanolaunchers may head. Abundant data was available on financials, launches\nand the technical design, including its evolution over time. Adjusting for inflation Figure 5 shows how this\ntraditional (business as usual), older system had performed over time. Data points shown are for individual years of\noperation. As expected, one feature of such data is the way fixed cost and variable cost concepts can be better\nunderstood when contrasting total yearly resources against the flight rates actually achieved. Together, total yearly\nfixed and total yearly variable costs would comprise any marginal cost per launch (total fixed + variable $ divided by\nflight rate). This would affect prices, capital, etc. in a private sector business case.\nA key takeaway would be the need for the study to assure fixed costs were properly addressed, and drivers or\ncauses understood, as fixed cost could be a significant contributor to prices.\n\nScout Program\nCost-Performance Curve\nTotal Scout Program Annual Expenditures, FY13 $M\n\n(No Scout Dev $$\'s)\n$300\nTrend Line (No Development)\ny = 11.25x + 67.791\n$250\nFixed Cost = $67.8M/Year\nMarginal Cost = $11.3M/Flight\n$200\n\n$150\n\n$100\n\n$50\n\n$0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nFlight Rate (by Fiscal Year)\nSource: NASA CR165950/Part 1, Table LXIII, p. 271 and Table CLIII(a), pp. 437 -8\n\nFigure 5: Scout rocket cost-performance trend.\n\n8\n\nMissiles data also provided somewhat of a sanity check going into the process of analyzing nanolauncher\npossibilities. As with the Scout data though, a healthy recognition of data shortcomings was required. Data may be\nold, biased, incomplete, ill-defined as to content, and so on, unless a more rigorous search (and access, such as to\ncontracts) is undertaken. This may represent forward work. Missiles data nonetheless provided useful sanity checks\nin the nanolauncher assessment process. Asking if a Nano-Launcher can be had for $1M-$2M, to make and launch,\nis like asking if a solid rocket Surface-to-Air missile (SAM) of the same scale can be had while \xe2\x80\x93\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nAvoiding a multi-billion dollar development cost (historical SAM\xe2\x80\x99s)\nCosting much less than $3-$4M a unit to manufacture (possibly having to cost significantly less as some SAMs\nexceed even these amounts).\nManufacturing in similar lot sizes (100 units)\nCarrying less payload (possibly, vs. SAMs at 60kg)\nCarrying only non-hazardous payloads\nDeleting some requirements (ground based vs. sea-based launchers, storage, etc.)\nAdding other requirements (flight termination systems (FTS) on some stages, etc.)\nMeeting similar precision (but to orbit)\nBreaking up the design/performance; having more stages\n\n9\n\nFor comparison, a missile to scale alongside other launcher and a potential nanolauncher is shown in Figure 6.\nThe reader should note that some nanolauncher efforts would fall into the SAM missile scale, while wanting to do so\nas relatively small businesses, and offering full \xe2\x80\x9cfly-away\xe2\x80\x9d prices (manufacturing plus operations and launch) well\nbelow what missile manufacturers charge only for manufacturing. Again, this informs the scale of the challenge as\nmuch as the scale of the systems to be analyzed.\n\nRaytheon\nSM-2\n\nNanolauncher\nScales\n\nFigure 6: A sense of scale for nanolaunchers.\n\n10\n\n7. Assessment Process: Models\nPerformance and cost assessment was accomplished iteratively as well as with some redundancy. Multiple cost\nmodels were deployed. This approach would assure that (1) sizing and performance were reasonable, (2) any\nweakness in any single cost model could be understood when comparing against other models, and (3) any results\ncould be better supported, with more confidence. In its broad strokes, the specific models, process, and results are\nshown in Figure 7. Based on comparisons with historical small launch systems, such as Scout, initial questions that\nare asked are whether large reductions in recurring launch cost are achievable, while still meeting performance\nrequirements, through a combination of reduced vehicle scale (resulting from payload downsizing) and increased\nflight rate.

Although\nACT is not a deterministic model, it does use characteristics (parametric factors) of the architectures/systems being\ncompared to produce important system outcomes (figures-of-merit) of different system configurations, as well as\ndifferent business assumptions and system utilization scenarios. The ACT prototype has both spreadsheet and serverbased technologies and contains a set of algorithms that processes system configuration and characteristics to a\nmeasure of system affordability. Parametric factors are derived from quantifiable data about each system\nconfiguration\'s attributes. An initial algorithm converts quantifiable system configuration and characteristics data\ninto a parametric factor on-the-fly for architecture/system complexity. The next set of ACT algorithms processes the\ncomplexity into system affordability figures-of-merit. These algorithms are initialized using known space\ntransportation data to "anchor" embedded values in the algorithms. The algorithms allow the comparison of standard\nprocesses embedded with mathematically consistent values. This will not necessarily produce an exact forecast\n(deterministic cost number), but instead provide consistent figures-of-merit suitable for surfacing more affordable\nand productive systems and technology alternatives. ACT is scalable in that it can compare architectural design\nconcepts of large scale systems (elements) down to subsystems and their differing technology content. Although the\nconfiguration of these systems may be vastly different, ACT can make functional comparisons based on multiple\nsystem attributes.\nArchitectural Characteristics\nKey Life-cycle Parameters (KLPs)\n\nSystem Architecture Definition\nDesign & Technology Influences\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nComplexity\nDesign Life/Reusability\nOperability\nManufacturability\nHazards\nQualification/Certification Approach\n\nBusiness Architecture Assumptions/Scenarios\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Market/Demand Scenarios\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cDesign of the Workforce\xe2\x80\x9d Influences\n(Processes & Practices)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Design & Development Approach/Skill Level\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Manufacturing/Production Approach/Skill Levels\nvels\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Flight/Ground Operations Concept/Skill Levels\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Acquisition Concept/Approach (Make, Buy, etc.)\n\nArchitectural Attributes\nKey Life-cycle Components\nFLIGHT & GROUND SYSTEM\nNON-RECURRING DDT&E\nCOSTS AND SCHEDULE\nRECURRING FLIGHT SYSTEM PRODUCTION\nUNIT COSTS AND PRODUCTION RATES\nANNUAL FIXED PRODUCTION COSTS\nRECURRING FLT & GND OPERATIONS\nVARIABLE FLIGHT COSTS\nANNUAL FIXED INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS\n\nBUSINESS INTEGRATION COSTS\n\nSYSTEM PERFORMANCE\nSPACE VEHICLE DRY MASS\nPROPULSION PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS\n\nSYSTEM VARIANCE\nFLIGHT SYSTEM RELIAIBLITY\nGROUND SYSTEM RELIABILITY\n\nInvestment Return Indicators\nLife Cycle Comparison Metrics\n\nAffordability\nTotal Life Cycle Cost\nTotal System Acquisition Cost\nAnnual Production & Ops Cost\n(Fixed and Variable)\nCost-per-Flight\nCost-per-kg\nProductivity\nLifetime Payload Mass Delivered\nPayload mass-per-year delivered\nResponsiveness\nAnnual Flight Rate\nSystem Flight Rate Capability (flts/yr)\nVehicle Performance\nPayload Mass Capacity (mass/flt)\nCrew/Passenger Capacity (seats/flt)\n\nFigure 8: Schematic representation of the Affordability Comparison Tool (ACT) prototype.\n\n24\n\nCarey McCleskey, Timothy Bollo, Jerry Garcia, \xe2\x80\x9cAffordability Comparison Tool (ACT),\xe2\x80\x9d NASA Tech Briefs, February, 2014.\n\n12\n\nx\n\nIDEA/AML:\n\nIDEA (Integrated Design & Engineering Analysis)25 is a collaborative environment for parametrically modeling\nconceptual and preliminary launch vehicle configurations using the Adaptive Modeling Language\xc2\xae (AML\xe2\x84\xa2) as the\nunderlying framework. The environment integrates geometry, configuration, propulsion, aerodynamics,\naerothermodynamics, trajectory, closure and structural analysis into a generative, parametric, unified computational\nmodel where data is shared seamlessly between the different disciplines. IDEA has extensive development heritage\nand application within NASA Langley Research Center\'s Vehicle Analysis Branch toward reusable launch vehicle\ndesign, and in particular, toward hypersonic air-breathing based systems. Much was leveraged from prior\ndevelopment by AFRL of the IPAT system for the Reusable Military Launch System (RMLS) concept work. For the\npresent application, a new IDEA "class" was derived to enable modeling of expendable multi-stage launch vehicles\nat this relatively small scale. A number of mass estimating relationships (MERs) were developed that are applicable\nto this scale. Developing "rubberized" parametric solid motor modeling posed particular challenges. The IDEA\nenvironment is particularly well suited for performing system requirements sensitivities and/or technology trades\ngiven its parametric nature. IDEA provides the performance related metrics (mass, payload, trajectory, etc.) that are\nused as input to the life cycle analysis (cost, ops, etc.) predictions that are of ultimate interest.\n\nFigure 9: Sample screen of the Integrated Design & Engineering Analysis collaborative modeling environment.\n\n25\n\nJ.

The model integrates both technical and non-technical descriptive inputs \xe2\x80\x93 that is, the user selects from\ndrop-downs to describe the rocket\xe2\x80\x99s design as well as its non-technical context such as industry processes and\npractices. Development, manufacturing and operations/launch portions of a projects life cycle are all covered.\nChallenges here included scale as well as the applicability of many model relationships that had been developed\noriginally with larger launch systems in mind.\nx\n\nSEER-H:\n\nA commercially available cost estimating suite, SEER for Hardware, Electronics & Systems (SEER-H27) was also\nused to develop an alternative costing look at development and production costs within the total life cycle of the\nnanolauncher design. The tool can be used in early stage development efforts to predict development and production\ncosts, deterministically or probabilistically. Phase I efforts focused on the creation of a Scout-D cost model and a 4stage solid rocket motor nanolauncher cost model. The intent was to understand rate change effects using this tool\nand to determine component cost drivers limited to the design/production cost area. An initial Scout model\ncomposed of 111 hardware cost elements was created to understand these effects. The 15 element initial 4-stage\nsolid rocket motor nanolauncher cost model serves as a placeholder as more detailed designs evolve, and the\nframework can guide research and design iterations towards realistic trades and identifying potential cost drivers.\nThe limitation of the SEER-H model, as applied to this study, is a lack of estimation ability on launch operations and\nground facility costing, which the other cost models (L-LCC and ACT) can address.\n\nFigure 10: A high-level schematic/description of the SEER-H model.\n\n26\n\nThe ez-Launcher Life Cycle Cost (ez-L-LCC) model (Excel format) is available upon request.

Results\nThe phase I nanolauncher assessment would focus on a 4-stage solid rocket \xe2\x80\x9cbaseline\xe2\x80\x9d as shown in Figure 11. A\n\xe2\x80\x9cbaseline\xe2\x80\x9d would be representative of that type of launch system. Design and technology assumptions were\ninfluenced by sounding rocket designs and the desire to baseline existing technologies. Results shown were\ngenerated using IDEA and are of a preliminary and conservative nature, with improvements expected as the\nmodeling is matured and refined.\n\nFigure 11: Concept 1 baseline of the nanolauncher technology and life cycle assessment.\nAnother nanolauncher \xe2\x80\x9cbaseline\xe2\x80\x9d concept also defined during phase I was an all-liquid two-stage system as\nshown in Figure 12. Beyond the differences due to the liquid propulsion system, the concept had similar\nassumptions to Concept 1. Sizing for Concept 2 was done with simplified mass fraction techniques rather than the\nIDEA modeling and is of lower analysis fidelity than Concept 1. Vehicle Sketch Pad was utilized for the\nconfiguration layout shown.\nThere are a number of consequences due to scaling down from EELV scale that affect the design of these very\nsmall launch vehicles. These include higher relative drag losses, higher flight loads that drive up structural mass, and\nincreased dispersions from the desired flight profile that the upper stages will have to correct for. Higher drag losses\nwill drive up the required propellant fraction to achieve orbit as compared to larger launch vehicles. Elaborating on\nsome of these issues:\n1.\n\nDelta velocity losses due to aerodynamic drag increases inversely proportional to vehicle scale. This is due to\nthe fact that drag is proportional to area or scale squared whereas available energy (propellant) is proportional to\nvolume or scale cubed. So if you reduce launch vehicle scale to 10%, your drag loss will be .1 2/.13 = 10 times\noriginal. Typically, for EELV class launch vehicles, the drag loss is about 3%. Therefore for a one tenth scale\nlaunch vehicle, the drag loss would be about 30%. This requires increasing relative propellant loading\n(propellant fraction) or increasing the number of stages.\n\n15\n\nFigure 12: Concept 2 baseline of the nanolauncher technology and life cycle assessment.\n2.\n\nNormal (lateral) loading during assent also increases inversely proportional to vehicle scale. Given that normal\nload due to angle of attack or cross winds (winds aloft) are proportional to area or scale squared whereas vehicle\nmass is proportional to volume or scale cubed, the normal accelerations and therefore responses/loads increases\ninversely proportional to scale in a similar fashion as drag. This will drive up vehicle bending as well as lateral\nacceleration inertial loading.\n\n3.\n\nSolid rocket motor based vehicles incur additional impacts. Axial acceleration/load and maximum dynamic\npressure increases inversely proportional to vehicle scale as well due to the fact that thrust is proportional to\npropellant burn surface area and vehicle mass is proportional to volume. Burn area is proportional to scale\nsquared assuming the propellant grain pattern is the same. Axial acceleration is a function of thrust divided by\nvehicle mass. Dynamic pressure profile will essentially increase in proportion to axial acceleration. Dynamic\npressure increase compounds the problem given that both drag and normal load is proportional to it, further\nincreasing the propellant loading requirement and structural demands on the launch vehicle. Liquid rocket\nengine based designs inherently decouple the thruster sizing from the propellant mass allowing the thruster\n(engine) to be scaled independently and mitigate much of this effect. Typically, solid rocket motor based\nsystems require more stages for these reasons.\n\nThe combined set of models was applied, at times comparing one model\xe2\x80\x99s results against another for added\ninsight. The new, baseline concepts were \xe2\x80\x9canchored\xe2\x80\x9d (but not limited) by the Scout reference data previously\ndescribed (Figure 5). Knowing what total costs may have been (for historical references) or would have to be (for\nnew concepts) still required seeing assessment results in light of what kind of costs arise and where these potential\ncosts most arise. As seen in Figure 13, it is important that analysis, investments and efforts in this area pay attention\nto fixed costs, especially in production.\n\n16\n\nSCOUT Recurring Cost ~$24M/Flight @ 5.3 Flight-per-Year Average\n(FY 2013 Basis)\n\nCost-per-Flight, $M FY13\n\n$30.0\n$24.0\n\n$25.0\n$20.0\n$15.0\n$9.3\n\n$10.0\n\n$5.7\n$3.8\n\n$5.0\n\n$3.2\n\n$2.0\n\n$0.0\n\nProd Fixed\n\nProd Variable\n\nInteg Wrap\n\nOps Fixed\n\nOps Variable\n\nTotal\n\nRecurring Cost Component\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Scout/historical:\nSmallest recurring cost\ncomponent alone\nexceeds $2M/flight\nCost-per-flight sensitive\nto flight rate\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Particularly for\nutilization less than 5\nper-year\n\nFigure 13: What kind of costs (fixed) and where (production) require attention in nanolauncher analysis.\n\nNL001/All-Solid\nw/ BAU Processes & Practices\n@ 12 flts/yr\nInteg\nWrap\n16%\n\nOps Variable\n13%\n\nOps Fixed\n9%\n\nInteg\nWrap\n9%\n\nNL001/All-Solid\nw/ Streamlined Com\'l Practices\n@ 12 flts/yr\n\nOps\nVariable\n7%\n\nProd Fixed\n26%\n\nOps Fixed\n10%\n\nProd\nVariable\n36%\n\nRecurring Cost: ~$12M/flt\n\nProd\nVariable\n25%\n\nProd Fixed\n49%\n\nRecurring Cost: ~$4M/flt\n\nFigure 14: Concept 1 (all-solid nanolauncher) breakout of results\nAlong these lines, a breakout of results for the baseline, new concepts was derived, as shown in Figure 14.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMajority of recurring costs are accumulated in Nano-Launcher production\nFixed costs (production and operations together) are substantial\nStreamlined practices reduce costs and can influence any of the recurring cost elements\n\n17\n\nWithin the prior understanding, one of the broader results of the preliminary assessment is shown in Figure 15.\n\nN/L Cost-per-Flight Sensitivities\n$28\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 All-Solid concept (4-stage) versus allLiquid concept (2-Stage) examined\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Streamlined processes/practices offer\ngreat potential but not sufficient to\nmeet goal\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Application of advanced technology\nhas the potential to achieve the goal\n\nCost-per-Flight, $M/FLt FY13\n\n$24\n\n$20\n\n$16\n\n$12\n\nNL001/All-Solid\nw/ BAU Processes & Practices\nNL002/All-Liquid\nw/ BAU Processes & Practices\n\n$1-2M N/L Costper-Flight Goal\n\n$8\n\nNL001/All-Solid\nw/ Streamlined Com\'l Practices\n\n$4\n\nNL002/All-Liquid\nw/ Streamlined Com\'l Practices\n$0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFlight Rate, Flights/year\n\nFigure 15: Overall results of the preliminary nanolauncher assessment for solid and liquid propulsion options.\nThere are some important caveats when thinking about how nanolauncher costs per flight vary with flight rate.\nThe most important thing when reading such charts is to read them asking \xe2\x80\x9cif the flight rate were X, then what would\napproximate costs be per flight\xe2\x80\x9d. A company wanting to offer certain prices would have to assure enough orders, and\nan ability to fulfill those orders by producing enough flights, to keep costs per flight well below prices \xe2\x80\x93 to even\nbegin to have numbers add up. Other considerations include:\nx\n\nThe size of a company that would be dealing with million dollar launches, in a \xe2\x80\x9cwhat-if\xe2\x80\x9d of around 15 launches\nper year, might be as few as a hundred or so employees. Endless variations around these numbers can be\ncalculated; perhaps more for labor, or less for materials, for labor rates that are average, or lower because of a\nmore supplier driven concept, and so on. Nonetheless, the workforce numbers will hover around the range of\nthis basic \xe2\x80\x9cwhat-if\xe2\x80\x9d when dealing with 10\xe2\x80\x99s of launches and prices in the low million dollars range.\n\nx\n\nFixed costs and variable costs, both of which contribute to marginal costs, are naturally linked to flight rate and\nthe productivity of a workforce. Technology, design, and process steps in manufacturing and operations, will all\naffect the actual flight rate achievable with a given workforce. Figure 15 can be read many ways then. Since the\nteams cost assessment goal was relatively low, the results show promise for dedicated nanolaunchers if the\ncombination of market (actual demand), flight rate capability (actual productivity), technology improvements,\nand costs all combine successfully near the lower right.\n\n18\n\nx\n\nFixed costs should not be interpreted here in the traditional sense used in larger aerospace operations. Rather, it\nis assumed in the scenarios modeled that a company makes a commitment of resources that includes labor,\nfacilities, equipment, materials and supplies, suppliers/relationships, etc. If no launches were produced, what\nwould these costs add up to over a year? This would be akin to fixed costs. Separate these costs from costs that\nare more specific and additional due to an order for a launch, the variable costs. Figure 16 shows this\nseparation, where eventually the marginal costs approach the variable costs (the burn rate of fixed costs now\nbeing divided, amortized, over so many customers.)\n\nResults\nNano-Launcher Concept 1\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Can Concept 1 meet the NanoLauncher cost objective?\n\nFOR MANUFACTURING & OPERATIONS CAPACITY = DEMAND\nOF 15 LAUNCHES PER YEAR\nAll Values $M\n$1.4\n\n$16.0\n\n$1.2\n\n$14.0\n$12.0\n\n$1.0\n\n$10.0\n\nYES\n\n$0.8\n$8.0\n$0.6\n$6.0\n\n~$1M/unit\n(recurring manufacturing & launch)\n\n$0.4\n\nNano-Scale Concept 1 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFixed Cost for\nthe Year for\nthe Flight Rate\nIndicated\n\n$4.0\n\n$0.2\n\n$2.0\n\n$-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCumulative\nVariable Cost\n\n$-\n\nMarginal ($M)\nPer Launch\nMIN = 0.99\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\nFlight #\n\n4-stage Solid\nNo Common Stages (Diameter, Length)\nComposite Case\nNT RCS\nUnique Avionics per Stage\nLow COTS/componentry\nLow Manufacturing Tooling/Test Automation\nStandard/~No Payload Services\nLow Supply Base\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdeal\xe2\x80\x9d (Best) industry process/practices (manufacturing + ops efficiencies)\n\nFigure 16: One scenario run of many when modeling the costs of potential nanolauncher configurations.\n\n9.
