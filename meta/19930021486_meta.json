It was not finalized, however, because the FAR's for pilot certification did not recognize helicopter simulators and, therefore, permitted no credit for their use. That is being rectified, and, when the new rules are published, standards must be available for qualifying simulators. Because of the lack of a data base to support specification of these standards, the FAA must rely on the knowledge of experts in the simulator/training industry. A major aim of this workshop is to form a working group of these experts to produce a set of standards for helicopter training simulators.", "title": "Helicopter simulator standards", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930021486, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Boothe, Edward M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "eebd0a565d814ba5bf3830a073bcd2b5"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930021486, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930021486, "id": "8ea84a43358d4020b9eefae98fb49865", "publicationName": "NASA(FAA Helicopter Simulator Workshop", "publicationDate": "1992-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930021484, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA/FAA helicopter simulator workshop", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930021486.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930021486/downloads/19930021486.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930021486/downloads/19930021486.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930021486/downloads/19930021486.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
