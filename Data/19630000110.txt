b"November 1964\t\n\nBrief 63-10561\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\t\n\n-I&\n\nThis NASA Tech Brief is issued by the Technology Utilization Division to acquaint\nindustry with the technical content of an innovation derived from the space program.\n\nTiny Sensor-Transmitter Can Withstand Extreme Acceleration, Gives \r\nDigital Output\nVariable Pressure\nure-Se\nIndu\n\nVariable\nTemperature\n\nC2\n\nBASIC CIRCUIT\n\nThe problem: The measurement and simultaneous\ntransmission of physical magnitudes, e.g., pressure\nand temperature, on a projectile.\nThe solution: A compact, dual mode, radiofrequency transmitter, capable of withstanding severe\naccelerations and shocks.\nHow it's done: The transmitter is a self-pulsing\noscillator that transmits a signal in pulses. The time\nbetween pulses is controlled by the RC, network,\nand the frequency is controlled by the LC 2 network.\nWith proper choice of component values, the basic\ncircuit transmits at a frequency of 136 mc. Variations\nin the component values in each of the two networks\ndue to environmental (e.g., pressure and temperature)\nchanges will appear as changes in frequency and time\n\nONE FORM OF CIRCUIT FOR MEASUREMENT \r\nOF PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE\n\nbetween pulses in the transmitted signal. To measure\npressure, the basic oscillator frequency can be varied\nby a pressure-sensitive inductance in place of L or by a\npressure-sensitive capacitor in place of C 2. To measure\ntemperature, the time between pulses can be varied by\na thermistor in place of R or by a temperature-sensitive capacitor in place of C 1 . The second illustration\nshows the circuit using a pressure-sensitive inductance\nand thermistor for measurement of pressure and\ntemperature.\nThe sensor-transmitter has a 60-hour operating life\non its self-contained batteries and a range of 25 feet\nwithout an antenna. Its transmitting range can be\nconsiderably increased with the addition of an antenna.\nThe device, including batteries, potted in a cylindrical\n(continued overteal)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

It has successfully transmitted data from projectiles during flight at hypersonic speeds in the ballistic ranges and continued to\nfunction normally after impact.\nNotes:\n1. Because of its unique ability to withstand high\naccelerations, this device might find application in\nsituations where data transmission is required after\nlaunch to remote locations and subsequent impact.\nExamples of such inaccessible areas might be\nmountainous regions, mines, and oil wells.\n2. The device may also be useful as a sensor and\ntransmitter in meteorological, military, police, and\nrescue work.\n\nBrief 63-10561\t\n\nInquiries concerning this invention may be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nAmes Research Center\nMoffett Field, California, 94035\nReference: B63-10561\nPatent status: NASA encourages the immediate\ncommercial use of this invention.
