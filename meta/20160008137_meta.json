Airbus DS Friedrichshafen (ADSF) proposed a design based on the Antenna Pointing Mechanism (APM) family with modifications that met the stated needs of the constellation. A qualification program was started beginning in September 2015 to verify the launch and thermal loads and the equipment performance (Radio Frequency, Pointing, Microvibration and Magnetic Moment). Technical challenges identified with the Engineering Model will be discussed within this paper.", "title": "APM for a Constellation Intersatellite Link - EM Qualification and Lessons Learned", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2016-06-30T16:10:21.5730000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20160008137, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hartel, Frank"}, "organization": {"name": "Airbus Defence and Space", "location": "Friedrichshafen, Germany"}}, "id": "5cb4c56fb3c7453b80fe28386f2666d7"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20160008137, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kozilek, Horst"}, "organization": {"name": "Airbus Defence and Space", "location": "Friedrichshafen, Germany"}}, "id": "07a1111564024dedbe5acf0c1c9265dc"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20160008137, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160008137, "id": "3a17bf1adc874e849f71e7bbe5ccb31b", "publicationName": "43rd Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium", "publicationDate": "2016-05-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20160004038, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "43rd Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160008137.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160008137/downloads/20160008137.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160008137/downloads/20160008137.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160008137/downloads/20160008137.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
