This model, referred to in this report as the COLD-SAT dynamic model, consists of both a trajectory model and an attitudinal model. All disturbance forces and torques expected to be significant for the actual COLD-SAT spacecraft are modeled to the required degree of accuracy. Control and experimental thrusters are modeled, as well as fluid slosh. The model also computes microgravity disturbance accelerations at any specified point in the spacecraft. The model was developed by using the Boeing EASY5 dynamic analysis package and will run on Apollo, Cray, and other computing platforms.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930010799, "id": "7c0ce368afc640dfa4825481fc4b1900", "publicationDate": "1992-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930010799.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930010799/downloads/19930010799.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930010799/downloads/19930010799.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930010799/downloads/19930010799.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
