The problem is formulated as a nonlinear free boundary-value problem for the potential. Surface tension effects are neglected. The use of perturbation expansions results in a system of equations that can be solved by an efficient numerical procedure. Computations were made for jets issuing from orifices in various shapes including an ellipse, a rectangle, and an equilateral triangle. Computational results are presented illustrating the propagation of discontinuities and the formation of thin sheets of fluid.", "title": "Vertical slender jets", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T03:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810031129, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Geer, J.
