Increasing the effective aerobraking area of a\nspacecraft (without significantly increasing spacecraft mass) results in a corresponding reduction in the time required\nfor aerobraking. For example, if the effective area of a spacecraft is doubled,\nthe time required for aerobraking is\nroughly reduced to half the previous\nvalue. The dedicated deployable aerobraking structure thus enables significantly shorter aerobraking phases,\nwhich results in reduced mission cost,\nrisk, and allows science operations to\nbegin earlier in the mission.\nIn order to achieve a large area without\nimpacting the spacecraft or launch vehicle, a deployable structure is necessary.\nThe dedicated deployable aerobraking\nstructure uses a set of deployable rigid\n\xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d to deploy and support a large\nmembrane. The membrane is made of\nmaterial (Kapton, for example) that can\nwithstand the thermal and mechanical\nloads characteristic of aerobraking. Once\naerobreaking is complete, this aerobraking structure would be jettisoned into an\natmosphere-intercepting orbit and subsequently destroyed upon atmospheric\nentry. This concept uses a mechanical implementation distinct from inflatable\naerodynamic decelerators studied for aerocapture and other applications. Aerobraking requires multiple passes through\nthe atmosphere over several weeks (at\nleast), and so any small leaks or punctures that develop in an inflatable structure during that time could compromise\nthe inflatable structure; this makes inflatable structures a higher risk implementation for an aerobraking structure relative\nto the mechanical implementation used\nin this concept.\nTentative mechanical and thermal requirements for this technology have\nbeen developed. Full-scale proof of concept hardware corresponding to one\nquadrant of a 72 m2 aerobraking structure was successfully designed, fabricated, deployed, and tested. The lab\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\ntests were designed so that the mechanical loads in the 1-g lab environment\nwere higher than the anticipated aerobraking loads, which proved the structure could survive in flight. Finite element models were developed and found\nto be in good agreement with the proofof-concept hardware. Thermal and attitude stability aspects of the concept\nwere analyzed. Based on the preliminary requirements, hardware tests, computational models, and analyses developed, the concept was found to be\nviable using conventional engineering\nmaterials and techniques.\nIn addition to potential use on planetary missions, this technology can also be\nused as an inexpensive, robust, and reliable method for reducing orbital debris\nhazards in Earth orbit by increasing the\nrate of orbital decay of objects in orbit\nabout the Earth such as decommissioned satellites and spent launch vehicle upper stages.\nThis work was done by Louis R.

The portability of the\nhardware makes it quick and easy to\ntransport between test facilities. This\nhardware/software architecture is flexible enough to support a variety of diagnostic applications and test hardware,\nand the GUI-based rapid prototyping\ncapability is sufficient to support devel-\n\nopment, execution, and testing of custom diagnostic algorithms.\nThe PHALT operating system supports\nexecution of diagnostic algorithms\nunder real-time constraints. PHALT can\nperform real-time capture and playback\nof test rig data with the ability to augment/modify the data stream (e.g. inject\nsimulated faults). It performs algorithm\ntesting using a variety of data input\nsources, including real-time data acquisition, test data playback, and system simulations, and also provides system feedback to evaluate closed-loop diagnostic\nresponse and mitigation control.\nThis work was done by Kevin J. Melcher\nand Edmond Wong of Glenn Research Center\nand Christopher E. Fulton, Thomas S. Sowers, and William A. Maul of Analex Corp.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed\nto NASA Glenn Research Center, Innovative\nPartnerships Office, Attn: Steve Fedor, Mail\nStop 4\xe2\x80\x938, 21000 Brookpark Road, Cleveland,\nOhio 44135.

To\nsolve this problem, a model has been developed for the resonant frequency and\nquality factor of a cylindrical microwave\ncavity containing concentric cylindrical\nsamples. This model can then be inverted\nto obtain the real and imaginary dielectric constants of the material of interest.\nThis approach is based on using exact\nsolutions to Maxwell\xe2\x80\x99s equations for the\nresonant properties of a cylindrical microwave cavity and also using the effective electrical conductivity of the cavity\nwalls that is estimated from the measured empty cavity quality factor. This\nnew approach calculates the complex\nresonant frequency and associated electromagnetic fields for a cylindrical mi-\n\n43\n\n'
