To obtain optimum results\npossible with ultrasonic testing, the beam must be\naccurately focused on the bond line. Contact transducers are physically impossible to focus; wheel transducers are bulky, have a fixed focal length, and also\nrequire an external couplant spray.\nThe solution:\nA ballpoint-type ultrasonic probe assembly has\nbeen conceived which would scan in any direction,\neliminate external couplant spray, and focus on the\n\nbond line. The probe would combine the features of\nlarger, more complex probes into one small, easily\nused unit.\nHow it's done:\nThe ballpoint probe, shown in the figure, consists\nof a transducer water as a couplant, a correcting\nlens, and a ballpoint contact.\nDuring ultrasonic tests, the ball point is carefully\nplaced on the bond line. The ultrasonic beam is then\nfocused by varying the distance between the correcting\nlens and the transducer face (varying the focal point).\nThe external couplant spray is not required as the\nball applies its own self-contained couplant, which\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
