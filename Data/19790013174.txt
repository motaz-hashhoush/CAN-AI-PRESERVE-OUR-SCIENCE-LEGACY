(CI. 55\xe2\x80\x94159)\nTTiis invention relates to apparatus for separating liquids\nfrom gases or gaseous fluids,\n10\nThe invention has particular utility in air conditioning\nsystems such as those employed for conditioning the air\ndelivered to a compartment or enclosure. However, it\nis to \'oe understood that its utility is not limited to such\nsystems sines many other applications are possible, as 15\nwDl be apparent to those skilled in the art.\nHeretofore, in apparatus employed to remove moisture\nfrom air delivered to an encsoiure, the moisture was condensed cr coalesced into water droplets and the droplets\nwere conveyed or blown to a collector section of the ap- 20\nparatus where they gravitated to the lower portion of the\nsection. The water collected in the apparatus was drained\nfrom the apparatus by means of a vaived drain locr.ted on\nthe bottom of the collector section.\nA disadvantage cf the abcve-dsscribed separator is that 25\nsince the force of gravity is required to make the collected\nwater flow to-the lower portion of the collector section,\nthe separator could not be utilized under conditions of\nzero gravity. Another disadvantage of such a separator\nis that even if the collected water gravitated to the lower 30\nportion of the collector section the water could not be\ndrained from the apparatus if the apparatus were disposed\nfo that the vaived drain was in a position other than at\nthe bottom of the collector section.\nIt is an object of the present invention to overcome 35\nthe above disadvantages of prior water separators by\nproviding a separator wherein the collection and removal\nof the moisture in the fluid is not dependent upon, or\naffected by, gravity.\nIt is another object of the invention to provide a water 40\nseparator wherein all the collected water may be cyclically\ndrained from the apparatus irrespective of the attitude of\nthe separator.\nIt is still another object of the invention to provide\na water separator wherein z. fluid actuator is utilized 45\nto remove the collected water from the separator.\nOther and further objects of the invention will b? apparent from the disclosure ia the following specification,\nappended claims and drawing wheiein:\nCO\nFIG. 1 is a sectional view of a separator embodying\n. the present invention showing the sponge in position to\nabsorb and accumulate the moisture in the fluid flowing\nthrough the separator; and\nFIG. 2 is a sectional view taken on line 2\xe2\x80\x942 of FIG. 55\n1 showins the sponge compressed to squeeze the water\nout of the sponge.\nReferring to the drawing, a water separator embodying\nthe present invention is indicated generally at 10. The\nseparator comprises a housing 11 having an iniet 14 60\nfor admitting a stream of moisture-laden gas from which\nentrained liquid particles, such as water, are to be removed, and an outlet 15 through which the dry gas passes\nfrom the separator. Disposed within the housing 11 and\nsupported in more or kss centra! relation thereto is a body 65\ncf porous absorbent material such as, for example, a celiuous vinyl sponge 16 adapted to absorb and retain the\nmoisture in the fluid passing therethrough. The sponge\n16 Is shown rectangular in form, bat it is to be understood that it may be any suitable form and dimension.\n70\nThe sponge 16 is secured at one end to an imperforate\nplate 18 and is adapted to be reciprocated in the manrier\n\nhereinafter described into and out of a walled chamfer\n29 disposed in the housing 11 on one side of the inlet\nand cutlet 14 and -.5. The chamber 2-J is formed of a\ncover 21 ard a plurality of dependent wall plates 22\narranged to snugly receive the plate 18 when the sponge\n16 is moved into the chamber 20. An O-ring 23 is dfeposcd around the periphery of the plate IS to pit-vent\nleakage of the liquid past the plate when the sponge\n16 is moved into the chamber 20 and squeezed. The\nIquid or moisture squeezed out of the sponge 16 is forced\nthrough a check valve 25 located in tins cover 21 and\nconducted to a container, not shown, or other place of\ndisposal. The chock valve 25 functions to prevent bacfcflow of tlie liquid into the chamber 20 when the spouse a\nretracted from the chamber.\nAn actuator, designated generally by the numeral 27,\nis provided to effect movement of the sponge 16 into\nand out cf the chamber 20. The actuator includes aa\ninner tubular member 28 secured on one end to fee\npiste 18 and on i\'.s opposite end to a piston 29. The\npiston 29 anc! the tubular member 23 are arranged to\nreciprocate within a chamber 30 formed within an outer\ntubular member 32. The tubular member 23 additionally\nextends through a guide member 33 to reciprocate the\nplate 13 ia the housing 11. The outer tubular Eensbar\n32 surrounds and is spr.ced from the inner tubular member 2S to form an annular chamber 34 which is bounded\nen one end by the guide member 33 and on the opposite\nend by the piston 29. One or more vent opecinss 36\nare arranged in the tubular member 2S adjacent the piston 23 to provide communication between the chamber\n34 and a chamber 37 formed within the inner tubular\nmember 23.\nA conduit 23 is provided for conducting pressurized\nfluid from a source, not shown, to a closure member 39\nsecured on one end of the chamber 30. A passageway\n40 in the member 3? joins the conduit 38 with a conduit\n42 leading to an opening 43 in the cuter tubular member 32. A cross passageway 44 leads froni the passageway 40 in the member 39 to the chamber 30.\nA solenoid valve 46 disposed in the conduit 38 is provided with a vent 47 and is arranged so that the chgmfrgr\n30 can be supplied with pressurized fluid from the conduit 38 or vented to a region of lower pressure, such as\nambient atmosphere, through the %\'cnt 47. A check vahs\n49 is arranged in the conduit 42 to permit equalization\nof the pressures on the two sides of the piston 29 daring\nthe squeeze stroke. A conduit 51 joins an opening 52\nin the cuter tubular member 32 with the pressure OJBduit 33 on the upstream side cf the solenoid valve 46\nand is provided with a check valve 53 to prevent UK\npressure on to? of the piston 29 from exceeding the pisssure in the conduit 38.\nIn operation, when the sponge is in the position shawm\nin FIG. 1, the chamber 30 is vented to a region of lower\npressure through the passageways 44 and 40, condail 38,\nsolenoid valve 46 and vent 47. The water droplets and\nmoisture in the fluid passing through the sponge !6 an\nretained in the sponge. When it is desired to Tenons the\naccumulated moisture from the sponge, the solenoid-valve\n46 is actuated to shut off the vent 47 and the chamber 3>\nis supplied with pressurized fluid from the conduit 3S\nthrough the passageways 40 and 44. Simultaneously,\npressurized fluid is fed through the conduit 42 and opening 43 to the chamber 34, and from the chamber 34\nthrough the openings 36 to the chamber 37 within the\ninner tubaiar member 28. The force of tte pressarfeed\nfluid acts on the entire face of the piston 29 in the clamber 30 and is opposed by the force of the pre\nfluid acting on the portion of the piston 29 in\nchamber 34. The differential between these two forces\n\n3,131,040\nmoves the piston 29, the tubular member 28, and the\nplate 18 in an upward direction, as shown in the drawing,\nso that the sponge 16 is compressed within the chamber\n29, as shown in FIG. 2, and ths accumulated moisture is\nsqueezed out of the sponge and forced through the check\nvalve 25 to a place of disposal.\nWhen the solenoid 46 is de-energized to return the\nsponge 16 to the position shown in FIG. 1, the chamber\n30 is again vented to a region of Sower pressure through\nthe passageways 44 and 40, conduit 38, solenoid valve\n46 anJ vent 47. However, due to the check valves 49\nand 53 the upper side of the piston 29 remains pressurized, initially at line pressure. As the piston assembly\ncomprising the plate 13, the tubular member 28 and the\npiston 29 is initially urged in the downwardly direction,\nas shown in the drawing, by the expanding sponge, the\nforce of ihe pressurized fluid on the upper side of the\npiston 29 acting on that poition of the piston in the annular chamber 34 will augment the force exerted by the\nexpanding sponge and continue the downward movement\nof the piston assembly. This process involves an expansion in the fluid volume of the pressurized fluid and\nhence the finalized pressure and the resultant force on the\nupper side of the piston will be lowered. The upper side\nof the piston remains pressurized ai the lowered pressure\nuntil another squeeze stroke is initiated.\nAs the sponge 16 is retracted from the compressed\nposition in the chamber 20 shown in FIG. 2 to the expanded position shown in FIG. 1, a partial vacuum is\ncreated in the chamber 2D. To prevent this vacuum from\nadversely affecting the return of the sponge to the position\nshewn in FIG. 1, a check valve 55 having a connection\nwith the chamber 20 is arranged to permit fluid to flow\nfrom a source, such ES the ambient atmosphere, into the\nchamber 20 to relieve the partial vacuum in the chamber.\nV/e claim:\n1.
