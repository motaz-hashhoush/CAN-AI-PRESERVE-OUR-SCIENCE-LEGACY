These Current-Versus-Voltage Curves, obtained from measurements on a device like that of\nFigure 1, are characteristic of a field-effect transistor.\n\npaste was stencil-printed through the\napertures using a metal squeegee, and\nthe contacts were cured at 100 \xc2\xb0C on\na hot plate for 30 minutes. The P3HT\nmaterial was then drop cast on the\nsurface of the substrate, over the\nprinted contacts. Contact was made to\nthe cleaved wafer to form the gate.\nContact was made to the drain and\nsource carbon contacts through\n\nprobes connected to micromanipulators. Device measurements were conducted on an HP 4145B semiconductor parameter analyzer, with the\ndrain-source voltage varying from 0 to\n\xe2\x80\x93100 V, and the gate bias varying from\n0 to \xe2\x80\x93100 V in \xe2\x80\x9310 V steps.\nAs seen in Fig. 2, very good transistor\ncurves are obtained from the devices, indicating clear field-effect phenomena,\n\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of\nthe carbon-based contacts. In this case, a\ndevice with a channel length of 500 \xc2\xb5m\nand a channel width of 5,000 \xc2\xb5m was\nmeasured (multiple devices were characterized to verify repeatability of the\ndata). Other device geometries are possible, as printed feature sizes down to 37\n\xc2\xb5m have been demonstrated using stateof-the-art thick-film stencil/screen printing techniques.\nEnhancement of the drain-source current is clearly seen as a function of increasing gate bias in Fig. 2. In this case,\nan Ion/Ioff ratio of 44 was determined at\nVds = \xe2\x80\x93100 V, with Vg = 0 (Ioff) and Vg =\n\xe2\x80\x93100 V (Ion). A carrier mobility of \xc2\xb5 \xe2\x89\x88\n0.007 cm2/V-s was also estimated from\nthe data.\nThis work was done by Erik Brandon of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

In tests, the array was\nfound to perform well in detecting images at wavelengths from 8 to 9 \xc2\xb5m in\noperation at temperatures between 60\nand 70 K. The largest-format QWIP\nprior array that performed successfully\nin tests contained 512 \xc3\x97 640 pixels.\nThere is continuing development effort directed toward satisfying actual and\nanticipated demands to increase numbers of pixels and pixel sizes in order to\nincrease the imaging resolution of infrared photodetector arrays. A 1,024 \xc3\x97\n1,024-pixel and even larger formats have\n\n12\n\nbeen achieved in the InSb and HgCdTe\nmaterial systems, but photodetector arrays in these material systems are very expensive and manufactured by fewer than\nhalf a dozen large companies. In contrast, GaAs-photodetector-array technology is very mature, and photodetectors in\nthe GaAs material system can be readily\nmanufactured by a wide range of industrial technologists, by universities, and\ngovernment laboratories.\nThere is much similarity between processing in the GaAs industry and processing in the pervasive silicon industry.\nWith respect to yield and cost, the performance of GaAs technology substantially exceeds that of InSb and HgCdTe\n\ntechnologies. In addition, GaAs detectors can be designed to respond to any\nportion of the wavelength range from 3\nto about 16 \xc2\xb5m \xe2\x80\x94 a feature that is very\ndesirable for infrared imaging. GaAs\nQWIP arrays, like the present one, have\npotential for use as imaging sensors in\ninfrared measuring instruments, infrared medical imaging systems, and infrared cameras.\nThis work was performed by Murzy Jhabvala\nof Goddard Space Flight Center and K.
