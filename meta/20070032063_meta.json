The possibility of saving both fuel and reducing emissions has rekindled interest in breaking very long-range airline flights into multiple stages or even adopting in-flight refueling. It is likely that staging will result in lower fuel burn, and recent published reports have suggested that the savings are substantial, particularly if the airliner is designed from the outset for this kind of operation. Given that staging runs against the design and operation historical trend, this result begs for further attention. This paper will examine the staging question, examining both analytic and numeric performance estimation methodologies to quantify the likely amount of fuel savings that can be expected and the resulting design impacts on the airliner.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Ireland", "submissionId": 20070032063, "endDate": "2007-09-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "51a7bddab6d34c82b7f91f159d9cc2f4", "id": "07312b269f1e4bfcbc2cc817289c3e7e"}], "name": "7th AIAA Aviation Technology, Integration and Operations Conference (ATIO)", "location": "Belfast", "id": "51a7bddab6d34c82b7f91f159d9cc2f4", "startDate": "2007-09-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070032063, "id": "1f7f60d563544390ba8c9ca8ccf122cf", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070032063.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070032063/downloads/20070032063.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070032063/downloads/20070032063.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070032063/downloads/20070032063.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
