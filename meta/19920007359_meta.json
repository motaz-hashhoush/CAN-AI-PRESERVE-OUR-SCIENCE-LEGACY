The focus application field is architectural design, and the domain experts represent consultants in the area of daylighting, noise control, structural support, cost estimating, space planning, and climate responsiveness. Both the domain experts and the blackboard were implemented as production systems, using an enhanced version of the basic CLIPS package. Acting in unison as an Expert Design Advisor, the domain and control experts react to the evolving design solution progressively developed by the user in a 2-D CAD drawing environment. A Geometry Interpreter maps each drawing action taken by the user to real world objects, such as spaces, walls, windows, and doors. These objects, endowed with geometric and nongeometric attributes, are stored as frames in a semantic network. Object descriptions are derived partly from the geometry of the drawing environment and partly from knowledge bases containing prototypical, generalized information about the building type and site conditions under consideration.", "title": "ICADS: A cooperative decision making model with CLIPS experts", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920007359, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pohl, Jens"}, "organization": {"name": "California Polytechnic State Univ.", "location": "San Luis Obispo, CA, United States"}}, "id": "be2d492667df4e2e9e9d88da6877970d"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920007359, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Myers, Leonard"}, "organization": {"name": "California Polytechnic State Univ.", "location": "San Luis Obispo, CA, United States"}}, "id": "74afb16195504c039c43dc571fd0519a"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920007359, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920007359, "id": "b59b3738ed2f4878a408f2b70441707f", "publicationName": "NASA.
