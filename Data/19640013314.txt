Johnson\nChief, Instrumentation Branch\nNASA Manned Spacecraft Center - Florida Operations\nINTRODUCTION\nThe flight instrumentation system for\nProject Mercury spacecraft presented few\nbench maintenance problems. The small and\nrather straight-forward PAM-FM-FM flight\ninstrumentation system in Project Mercury\ncontained less than 100 information channels,\nand bench maintenance of the system at the\nlaunch site consisted of fault isolation, calibration, and performance verification at the\nreplaceable module, package, and system\nlevels. These activities were confined to\nflight information handling equipment oscillators, tape recorders, and PAM-PDM multiplexers and were accomplished with the use of\nseveral small manual test sets. Transducer\ncalibration was infrequent and was accomplished in an environmental test laboratory.\nBecause the bench maintenance equipment\nwas designed to test specific flight hardware\nconfigurations, it was often necessary to modify\nit to support various design versions of the\nflight hardware. This test equipment inflexi-.\nbility was not a major problem because of the\nsmall channel capacity and simplicity of the\ntest articles. However, launch site bench\nmaintenance of present day manned spacecraft\ninstrumentation does present a problem because\nof the many kinds of systems to be supported\nand the size and complexity of these systems.\nThe Gemini operational instrumentation consists of approximately 400 PCM channels. The\ntotal Apollo system (command module, service\nmodule, and lunar excursion module) consists\nof approximately 700 PCM channels. In\naddition to the operational systems, R&D type\ninstrumentation could contribute as much as\n100 channels of PAM-FM-FM information to\nthe spacecraft telemetry systems.\nAnother large system requiring bench\nmaintenance is the ACE-S/C carry-on PCM\nsystem. ACE-S/C is the digital stimulation\nand monitoring equipment used for spacecraft\ncheckout at the spacecraft contractor\'s\nfacility and at the launch site. The system\npresently contains 2600 PCM channels of\ntest-point data.\t\nThe bench maintenance requirements\nassocited with present day manned spacecraft instrumentation is one of providing\nreliable equipment to perform rapid and\naccurate bench tests on the many kinds of high\n\nchannel capacity flight systems. This paper\ndescribes SITE (Spacecraft Instrumentation\nTest Equipment), the flexible bench test set\ndesigned to satisfy bench maintenance requirements at the various NASA-MSC test sites and\nat spacecraft contractor facilities.\nSITE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\nSITE is a general purpose test set which\nis flexible enough in its interfaces to accomodate all manned spacecraft instrumentation\nsystems and flexible enough in its programming\nto accommodate flight hardware design changes.\nThe equipment can test all present instrument\xc3\xa1tion f) .ght hardware and can easily be made to\nsupport future instrumentation systems because\nof its modular -construction using off-the-shelf\nhardware as building blocks.\nSITE is capable of fault isolation and\ncertification at the replaceable module, package, and system levels. The instrumentation\nsystem is defined as all spacecraft data handling equipment excluding the transducers and\ntransmitters. An instrumentation package is\nthe smallest item of the system that is connected to spacecraft wiring, and a replaceable\nmodule is the smallest serialized unit that is\nplugged into a package. The certification of an\ninstrumentation system involves the determination of two factors: transfer function and\ncrosstalk. The transfer function is a characteristic of each individual data channel and\nincludes such items as gain, linearity,\nhysteresis, repeatability, resolution, back\ncurrent, and frequency response. Crosstalk\nconsists of such outside factors as data\nchannel crosstalk, common mode, and power\nsupply variations.\nSITE can be operated manually or automatically. Test time can be compressed by a\nfactor of 1000 to 1 by using the automatic mode\ninstead of the manual mode. The time required\nto calibrate present day instrumentation systems would be excessive and the results would\nbe subject to operator error if purely manual\nmethods were used. Automatic bench calibration greatly reduces system test time and\nprovides a standardization of test procedure\nwhenever and whereever the tests are performed. Hence, data may be rapidly gathered and\ninterpreted with some assurance that the test\nprocedures were constant. This uniformity\nof procedure is a fundamental requirement of\n\npresent day manned spacecraft test operations\r\nSYSTEM DESCRIPTION\nPhysically, SITE consists of two basic\nunits: a Control Console Unit and an Equipment\nConsole Unit as shown in Figure 1. The flight\nhardware to be tested is placed on a table\nadjacent to the equipment console and is cabled\nto a set of standard connectors on the console.\nFunctionally, SITE can be divided into 5\nmajor units: Control and Display Unit, Switching and Distribution Unit, Input Signal Generator Unit, Measurement Unit, and Demultiplexer\nUnit. Figure 2 is a functional block diagram\nshowing the major units and the basic physical\ninterfaces.\nPower is applied directly to the units\nunder test. Stimuli are routed to the units\nunder test and responses to the Measurement\nUnit by means of the programmable Switching\nand Distribution Unit. Multiplexed responses\nare fed directly to the Demultiplexer Unit: The\noutputs of the Measurement and Demultiplexer\nUnits are sent to the Control and Display Unit\nfor comparison, display, and storage. The\nControl and Display Unit provides the program\ncontrol required to accomplish switching and\ndistribution, stimuli value adjustment, measurement unit range control, and demultiplexer\ncontrol. This control can be generated automatically or manually at the Control Console Unit\nand is required to accomplish switching and\ndistribution. In addition to remote control by\nmeans of command, stimulus and response\nequipment can be manually adjusted at the\nEquipment Console Unit.\nA more detailed block diagram of SITE is\nshown in Figure 3. Each major unit can be\nbroken down into basic modular building blocks\nwhich consist in most cases of off-the-shelf\nhardware. It is this feature that provides the\nflexibility and the capability for the bench testing of yet to be designed instrumentation systems.\nCONTROL AND DISPLAY UNIT\nThe Control and Display Unit is housed\nin the control console, where three modes of\noperation are available: tape reader, keyboard,\nand remote manual. In the tape reader or\nautomatic mode, test control is achieved by\nmeans of a programmer-comparator. A\npunched tape and tape reader constitute the\ninstruction manual for the programmer-comparator and provide detailed instructions for\neach test configuration in the form of 8-bit\ncommand words. A keyboard is provided for\n\nmanual operation and allows the operator to\nduplicate punched tape commands. This mode\nis required to set up the Switching and Distribution Unit during manual tests. The mode also is\nuseful in programming tests and in debugging.\nOnce the Switching and Distribution Unit has\nbeen set up, manual operation at the control\nconsole is more efficiently accomplished by\nusing the remote manual mode. In this mode,\na manual sequencer generates the 8-bit command\nwords associated with each operator function the operator makes adjustments at the control\nconsole instead of punching coded commands on\nthe keyboard.\nThe command decoder accepts binary inputs from either the tape reader, keyboard, or\nmanual sequencer depending upon the status of\nthe mode select logic. The decoder contains the\nlogic to read the binary inputs and convert them\ninto functional area addresses, subaddresses,\nand discrete commands. These decoder outputs\nconstitute the program control and are stored,\ntransfered, or steered to the SITE functional\nareas where they perform device switching and\nadjustments. The command decoder includes an\nautocheck capability which is used to assure that\nthe program control information has been routed\nto the proper functional areas and has been properly interpreted. If an "autocheck no-go" is\nreceived, the tape reader will stop. Before\neach test sequence, a series of commands are\nread which exercise all the tape reader readout\ncircuits. This performs the same function as\nparity.\nThe display portion of the Control and\nDisplay Unit consists of a comparator, manual\nand automatic mode controls and displays, a\ndigital printer, and a tape perforator. The\ncomparator contains a digital portion and an\nanalog portion. The digital comparator reads\nthe analog to digital converter output from the\nMeasurement Unit and compares it to preset\nlimits which are inserted by the tape reader or\nkeyboard. The analog comparator is a Schmitt\ntrigger that detects noise components as small\nas 1% of full scale in the signal conditioner outputs during crosstalk tests. The comparator\noutputs are primarily "GO" and "NO-GO" signals which are routed to the control console\ndisplays.\nIn addition to the various controls and\ndisplays, the control console contains a digital\nprinter and a tape perforator. The printer\nprovides a permanent record of the tests in any\none of several print formats. The formats can\nbe automatically or manually set up. The tape\nperforator provides a mechanism for automatic\ndata handling and reduction in that test results\nin the form of punched tapes are generated\n\nwhich can be entered into digital computers for\nstorage and computations.\nSWITCHING AND DISTRIBUTION UNIT\nThe Switching and Distribution Unit\nroutes stimulus and response functions between\nSITE and the item under test. The unit is controlled by the command decoder during all modes\nof test and consists of reed relay matrices with\nsolid state drivers, preprogrammable-removable patchboards, and output connectors which\nprovide the interface between SITE and the unit\nunder test. There are a total of 2222 relays\ncontained in six independent matrices.\nThe pre\xc3\xabision stimulus matrix selects\nany one of four precision signals and applies it\nto a 4-wire bus. The bus can handle single\nended or differential signals plus a reference\nvoltage which is used in tests on phase sensitive\nsignal conditioner devices. The bus is routed to\nthe output stimulus matrix which can connect a\nprecision stimulus to any of 1152 output lines to\nthe unit under test. The output lines not\nconnected to precision signals are connected to\ncoarse signals.\nCoarse signals are required to maintain ambient conditions on data channels not under test and to perform data channel crosstalk\ntests. Many of the signal conditioners in present day manned spacecraft would be driven off\nscale with a short or open circuit input. To\nprevent overstressing these channels while they\nare not under test, it is necessary to apply\nambient input signals. Data channel crosstalk\nis measured by observing a particular channel\nand switching all other channels from nominal\nzero to nominal full scale. The zero and full\nscale signals are obtained from present ac and\ndc voltage supplies. The fixed voltage supply\noutputs are applied to a scaler unit which consists of a set of preprogrammable voltage\ndividers. The dividers provide a basic set of\n75 nominal zero, ambient, and full scale voltages\nThe scaler outputs are applied to the coarse stimuli matrix which switches the voltages between\nzero and full scale. A preprogrammable patchboard is used to expand the basic 75 coarse\nsignals to 1000 and to distribute them to output\nstimulus matrix.\nDuring a bench systems test it is\noften necessary to connect instrumentation\npackages in-series. SITE provides the interface between all series packages so that the\nindividual package transfer functions can be\nmeasured. This interface is provided by the\nResponse Matrix, Response Patchboard, and the\nResponse Stimulus Matrix as shown in Figure 3.\nThe response matrix routes data channel out-\n\nputs to the measurement matrix which can\nconnect any stimulus or response to any number\nof measurement devices. Those responses that\nare to be re-applied to the units under test as\nstimuli (for example, the application of signal\nconditioner outputs to a PCM unit) are routed\nback to the SITE interface by means of the\nresponse patchboard and the response stimuli\nmatrix.\nINPUT SIGNAL GENERATOR UNIT\nThe Input Signal Generator Unit consists of programmable precision stimuli\nsources, fixed coarse sources, and power\nsupplies. Device buffers provide the interface\nbetween the command decoder and the programmable precision sources. These sources\nconsist of the high and low level voltage and\nresistance functions required to calibrate\nspacecraft instrumentation. The precision dc\nsource is programmable in 1-millivolt increments from 0 to 250 volts and is accurate within\n0. 1 percent of the programmed value. The\nvoltage, frequency, and phase of the ac source\nare programmable. Voltages from 0 to 250\nvolts rms can be obtained in 4 ranges each of\nwhich is accurate within 0. 1 percent of the\nprogrammed value. The frequency is programmable from 50 to 4000 cps in 2-cps increments\nwith an accuracy of 0. 5 percent of the value.\nPhase is programmable from 0 to \xc2\xb1 180 degrees\nwith an accuracy of 0. 5 degree. A resistance\nsource is used to test resistance sensitive\ndevices. This source is programmable in\n1-ohm steps from 100 ohms to 10, 000 ohms\nand is accurate within 0. 1 percent of the\nsetting. The function generator provides the\nlow frequency sine- and square-wave signals\nrequired for impulse and frequency response\ntests on dc signal conditioners.\nOUTPUT DATA MEASUREMENT UNIT\n\nVarious programmable and non-pro grammable measurement devices are used as\nshown in Figure 3. Responses from the units\nunder test are routed to the Measurement Unit\nby the Switching and Distribution Unit. The\nmeasurements made by the analog to digital\nconverter, time interval meter, and the binary\n-to BCD converter are routed to the control console for comparison, display, and storage.\nDEMULTIPLEXER UNIT\nThe Demultiplexer Unit is used to\nseparate time and frequency multiplexed chanr[s.\nFor time multiplexed signals such as PCM, PA1V1\nor PDM, a programmable single channel de-commutator is used. This device receives\ntiming and reset pulses as test point data from\n\nthe unit under test and gates the time slot\nunder test to the measurement unit. A band\nswitching discriminator is used to demultiplex\nand discriminate FM/FM data. The band pass\nand low pass filter outputs of this signal are\napplied to the Measurement Unit. A telemetry\nindicator is provided to visually observe the\ncomposite or individual subcarrier frequency\nspectrum.\nOPERATION\nFault isolation and certification of\ninstrumentation at the system or package level\ncan be readily accomplished with general purpose bench maintenance equipment such as SITE.\nThis is because the packages are usually self\ncontained with respect to function, timing, and\nprogramming. This independence of function\nmay or may not exist at the replaceable module\nlevel - it tends to characterize the modules of\nmultichannel signal conditioner packages and it\ndoes not exist with PCM package modules. To\ntest interdependent replaceable modules without\nusing highly specialized module testers, the\nmethod of substitution is used. This method\nmakes use of a non-flight package and set of\nmodules which are electrically equivalent to\nthe flight items. The certification of a module\nis accomplished by interchanging it with the\nnon-flight equivalent and performing a package\nte gt. With respect to present day systems,\n\nthis substitution method of module testing will\nbe necessary only for the PCM packages.\nThe certification process in almost\nall cases involves a 5-point static-calibration\nthat is run from zero to full scale and back to\nzero. At a given step in this calibration\n(usually half-scale), the various crosstalk\ntests are performed. In this fashion, the total\ntransfer function is determined automatically.\nFault isolation is largely a manual process\nwhereby the package test points are usually\nscrutinized with a scope.\nIn addition to the autocheck feature,\nwhich insures that all commands have been\nproperly received and interpreted before execution, SITE contains a self test feature. During\nthis mode, stimuli connectors are jumpered to\nresponse connectors and a self test tape is played which exercises the entire SITE system.\nSelf test is the mechanism used to checkout\nSITE before each test or to perform fault\nisolation within SITE. The self test time including set up varies from 15 minutes for a\ngross checkout to 2 hours for complete checkout with fault isolation. With self test, faults\nwithin SITE can be isolated to at least 4 replaceable modules.\n\nCONTROL CONSOLE UNIT\n\nFIGURE I SITE CONFIGURATION\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n-\t\n\nSPACECRAFT HARDWARE\n\nEQUIPMENT CONSOLE\n\nCONTROL CONSOLE\n\nIS GU\n\t\n(INPUT SIGNAL\nGENERATOR UNIT)\n\nPOWER\n\nSTIMULI\nIr\nI\nCDu\t\nI PROGRAM\n(CONTROL AND I\nI CONTROL\nDISPLAY UNIT) I\n\nUUT\r\n(UNIT UNDER\n\nS DU\n(SWITCHING AND\nDISTRIBUTION UNIT)\n\nRESPONSES\nir\n\n(MEASUREMENT UNIT(\n\nDU\nLI IPLEX ER\nUNIT)\n\t\n\nFIGURE 2 BASIC BLOCK DIAGRAM OF SITE\n\n5PROGRAA\nCONTROL\n\nI\nI\t\nH\t 01 L\nI\t\n\nI I\n\n-\t\n\nAUXILIARY\n\n400CPS\t\nPOWER\t\n\nI\n\n0\t\n\nDC\t\nPOWER\t\n\n- DC\nPOWER\n\nI\t\n\n60 CPS\t\nPOWER\t\n\nI\n\nI\t\n0\t\n\n0\t\n\n0\nR\t\n\nPRECISION\t\n0CN\t\nAC\t\nDC\nVSETAUE VOLTAGE\t\n\nMDI\n\t\n\n5]\n\nU\t\n\nREMOTE\t\nMANUAL\n\nJ\t\n\nI\t\n\nAC\t\n\nI\n\nGE\t\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI COURSE I\t\nSTMIO\t\nSTIMULI I\t\nI MATRIX\n\nC____\t\n-B0UTPUT 5154W MATRIX \t\n\nI\n\nI\n\nSCALER\n\nI\n\nX\n\nI COARSE\n1i\t\n\nI VOLTAGE- L\nI\n\nKEYBOARD i\t\n\nCOARSE\t\n\nFUNCTION\nGEfR-\t\nATOR\t\n\nR\t\n*-.)I PRECISION STIMULI NATR0 \t\nSD\n\nE\t\n\nTAPE\t\nIt\n\t\n___\n\nI\n\n(SGU\n\n\t\nCOMMAND\nDECODER\t\n\nI\r\n\n___\nPATCABOARD\t\n\nI(\n\nI\n\nI\nI)\n\n-\n\nC\nE\nC\nB\nA\nH\nA\nD\nW\nA\nB\n\nINDICATOR\t\n\nI\n\nC DU\n\nFIGURE 3- SITE SIGNAL FLOW DIAGRAM \t\n\n.5.\n\nA-PROGRAM CONTROL\n\n'
