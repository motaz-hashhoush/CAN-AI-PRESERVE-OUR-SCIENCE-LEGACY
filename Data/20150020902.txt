Exchange\nBrian D. Haynes\nAgile Defense LLC\nMinneapolis, Minnesota 55450\n\n1 Executive Summary\nTechnology Candidates for Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground Data Exchange is a two-year research\neffort to visualize the U. S. aviation industry at a point 50 years in the future, and to define\npotential communication solutions to meet those future data exchange needs. The research\nteam, led by XCELAR, was tasked with identifying future National Airspace System (NAS)\nscenarios, determining requirements and functions (including gaps), investigating technical and\nbusiness issues for air, ground, & air-to-ground interactions, and reporting on the results. The\nproject was conducted under technical direction from NASA and in collaboration with XCELAR\xe2\x80\x99s\npartner, National Institute of Aerospace, and NASA technical representatives.\nParallel efforts were initiated to define the information exchange functional needs of the\nfuture NAS, and specific communication link technologies to potentially serve those needs.\nThose efforts converged with the mapping of each identified future NAS function to potential\nenabling communication solutions; those solutions were then compared with, and ranked\nrelative to, each other on a technical basis in a structured analysis process. The technical\nsolutions emerging from that process were then assessed from a business case perspective to\ndetermine their viability from a real-world adoption and deployment standpoint. The results\nof that analysis produced a proposed set of future solutions and most promising candidate\ntechnologies. Gap analyses were conducted at two points in the process, the first examining\ntechnical factors, and the second as part of the business case analysis. In each case, no gaps or\nunmet needs were identified in applying the solutions evaluated to the requirements\nidentified.\nThe future communication solutions identified in the research comprise both specific link\ntechnologies and two enabling technologies that apply to most or all specific links. As a result,\nthe research resulted in a new analysis approach, viewing the underlying architecture of\nground-air and air-air communications as a whole, rather than as simple \xe2\x80\x9clink to function\xe2\x80\x9d\npaired solutions. For the business case analysis, a number of \xe2\x80\x9creference architectures\xe2\x80\x9d were\ndeveloped for both the future technologies and the current systems, based on three typical\nconfigurations of current aircraft. Current and future costs were assigned, and various\ncomparisons made between the current and future architectures.\nIn general, it was assumed that if a future architecture offers lower cost than the current\ntypical architecture, while delivering equivalent or better performance, it is likely that the\nfuture solution will gain industry acceptance. Conversely, future architectures presenting\nhigher costs than their current counterparts must present a compelling benefit case in other\nareas or risk a lack of industry acceptance. The business case analysis consistently indicated\nlower costs for the proposed future architectures, and in most cases, significantly so. The\nproposed future solutions were found to offer significantly greater functionality, flexibility, and\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n5\n\ngrowth potential over time, at lower cost, than current systems. This was true for overall,\nfleet-wide equipage for domestic and oceanic air carriers, as well as for single, General\nAviation (GA) aircraft.\nThe overall research results indicate that all identified requirements can be met by the\nproposed solutions with significant capacity for future growth. Results also illustrate that the\nmajority of the future communication needs can be met using currently allocated aviation RF\nspectrum, if used in more effective ways than it is today. A combination of such optimized\naviation\xe2\x80\x93specific links and commercial communication systems meets all identified needs for\nthe 50-year future and beyond, with the caveat that a new, overall function will be needed to\nmanage all information exchange, individual links, security, cost, and other factors. This\nfunction was labeled \xe2\x80\x9cDelivery Manager\xe2\x80\x9d (DM) within this research. DM employs a distributed\nclient/server architecture, for both airborne and ground communications architectures.\nFinal research results included identifying the most promising candidate technologies for the\nfuture system, conclusions and recommendations, and identifying areas where further\nresearch should be considered.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n6\n\n2 Introduction\nThe effort to define, characterize and assess the relative merits of Technology Candidates for\nAir-to-Air and Air-to-Ground Data Exchange is designed to visualize and analyze the future\naviation communication needs of the National Airspace System (NAS), and ultimately to\nrecommend the optimum solutions based on the overall research results. Agile Defense, DBA\nXCELAR (XCELAR) performed the research summarized herein under contract to NASA, to\nperform a study of future air-to-air and air-to-ground datalink technologies as part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nAirspace Systems Program. The study focused on identifying technologies and potential\nsolutions to address datalink needs of the air transportation system fifty years into the future,\nnominally from 2013, when research began, through 2063. XCELAR\xe2\x80\x99s approach incorporated\nboth technical and business considerations, and considered the needs of General Aviation and\nUnmanned Aerial Systems in addition to those of air carriers and other jet operators. The\nperspective of the aircraft operator was an integral element of the evaluation process.\nA key consideration was to correctly define the underlying assumptions for the air\ntransportation system in the year 2063, particularly in terms of regulatory considerations,\nsystem user expectations and sensitivities, and their rate of evolution over the 50-year period.\nOne useful input to that process was to look back over a similar period, and assess the rate of\nchange over the past 50 years in the same industry.\n\nExamples of significant technical events approximately 50 years ago include:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n1963 - B727 first flight\n1963 \xe2\x80\x93 Cessna 336 enters service; 1965 \xe2\x80\x93 Cessna 337 in certification\n1963 \xe2\x80\x93 Lear 23 first flight\n1963 \xe2\x80\x93 First Laser Ring Gyro demonstrated\nSELCAL entered service approximately 50 years ago\n\nMore recent events help to put the timeline into better perspective: these notable events took\nplace approximately 30 years ago:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n1983 \xe2\x80\x93 First cellular telephone received FCC approval (Motorola DynaTac)\n1983 \xe2\x80\x93 First PDA (Psion 1); 1993 \xe2\x80\x93 Apple Newton\n1983 \xe2\x80\x93 GPS made available for civil use\n1981 \xe2\x80\x93 First Laser Ring Gyro certified\nACARS Entered service\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n7\n\nThis illustrates that the entire history of aviation datalink services to date is only approximately\n30 years, making the 50-year future projected herein nearly 40% longer than its whole service\nhistory. Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that the next 50 years could produce a greater\nscope of innovation, technology introduction, performance gains, and overall progress than\naviation data link has seen since its inception.\nThe XCELAR research team includes industry professionals whose experience spans the history\nof aviation data link to the present time, with an impressive track record in developing,\nimplementing, operating, and improving all types of aviation data links, in all segments of the\nindustry. The team believes that the research conducted, and the results presented herein,\nare both achievable and practical, and present a viable approach to meeting the aviation\ncommunication needs of the future.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n8\n\n3 Research Plan\nThe research was conducted in accordance with a structured plan that included parallel work\nflows to define the future datalink requirements, and to identify and characterize technical\ncandidates. Those two paths converged in comparison and gap analysis steps, with provisions\nfor a \xe2\x80\x9cfeedback loop\xe2\x80\x9d process to revisit previous steps as needed to fill gaps identified.\nTechnical analysis results were then examined from a business perspective, and another gap\nanalysis/feedback stage planned prior to final identification and characterization of the most\nfavorable candidates.\nA regular reporting process was used, employing a combination of monthly and other\nscheduled reports, and periodic results reports at key stages of the research process, among\nthe program deliverables.\n\n3.1 Research Process\nThe anticipated functions and requirements of the NAS of the future were defined using\ninput from NASA, industry, academia, and the study team, using a structure based on\nphase of flight and vehicle/operator types. These scenarios were then used to derive the\nassociated information flow and data communication requirements. In parallel, initial\nanalysis of candidate link technologies was initiated, starting with projected capabilities,\nloading, and improvements of currently available technologies through the study period.\nAn initial analysis of currently known link technologies was conducted to assess their\ncurrent and probable future capabilities compared to projected loads and other factors.\nThis \xe2\x80\x9clook forward\xe2\x80\x9d analysis provided a starting point in the identification and analysis of\nfuture solutions. It quantified potential unmet needs in current systems, and thus\nidentified that may require new solutions. An example is the current use of 1030/1090\nMHz for ATCRBS, ADS-B, TCAS, and other proposed functions such as air-to-air linking of\nwake turbulence data. The research team\xe2\x80\x99s analysis indicates that the current system will\nreach its capacity limit well before the 50-year future point, and alternate solutions must\nbe considered as part of the study.\nThe research then considered various candidate technologies for alternative future links,\ncharacterizing those that showed the most promise from a technical standpoint, and\nincrementally maturing the most viable ones. Architectural and infrastructure issues were\nconsidered, along with compatibility with other current and future systems. Performance\nmodeling was conducted to allow technical comparisons between candidates, and a\nstructured candidate comparison was developed between the twelve most viable\ncandidates from a technical perspective.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n9\n\nFinally, those candidate solutions that were deemed technically viable were subjected to\nbusiness case analysis, which examined the costs of proposed future solutions relative to\ncurrent industry practice. The ultimate goal of the research was to identify a group of most\npromising technologies for the aviation datalink 50 years in the future.\nFig. 1 depicts the overall flow of the research from beginning to end, with reports at\nvarious key points in the process. The parallel paths of defining future NAS functions and\nderived communication requirements, and of identifying potential candidate link\ntechnologies, are shown in the upper left area. Those two efforts converge with the\nevaluation of candidates against technical requirements, with those deemed to be worthy\nof further research documented in the Technology Candidate Descriptions report. An\nanalysis of various system considerations was then initiated, with the results documented\nin the Infrastructure and Architectural Needs report.\n\nAt this point in the research, any identified gaps or unmet needs would have initiated a\nparallel effort to identify additional or alternative candidates to potentially fill the gap. This\npart of the process is depicted in the upper right portion of the flow chart. Remaining\ncandidates were subjected to a structured comparison process to quantify the relative\nmerits of all viable candidates for each identified function, from a technical perspective.\nResults were documented in the Candidate Comparison report. One of the conclusions of\nthe research to that point was that there were in fact no gaps or unmet needs, and a group\nof nine candidate link technologies, and two underlying or enabling technologies, became\nthe focus of the business case analysis.\nThe business case analysis, shown near the bottom center of the flow chart, examined the\npotential costs of the 50-year future solution proposed as a result of the technical research,\nrelative to current industry solutions and their costs. Another gap analysis was performed\nbased on the totality of the research and its results, with another potential \xe2\x80\x9cfeedback loop\xe2\x80\x9d\nto examine potential ways to fill identified gaps. Again, no gaps were identified, and the\nresearch proceeded to the final planned step, identifying the most promising candidate\nsolutions. Both the business case analysis and the most promising solutions were\ndocumented in the Most Promising Technology Alternatives report. The research was\ndivided into two segments, designated the Base Year and Option Year one.

The scope of the review\nincluded future NAS operations concepts, future datalink technologies, and future information\nexchange needs. A detailed summary of literature reviewed can be found in Appendix 2.\nThe goal of the literature review was to identify and document past or existing efforts and\ndocumentation regarding the datalink needs of the future National Airspace System (NAS) Air\nTransportation Systems for the 2013-2063 time period. Objectives were to identify relevant\nanalysis, studies, and methodology during the literature review, to help bring the current state\nof knowledge in synch with the team\xe2\x80\x99s hypotheses, including the potential identification of:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nApplicable \xe2\x80\x9cFuture NAS Scenario\xe2\x80\x9d inputs\nOther research that has investigated closely related issues\nExtant models applied to similar problems, and their assumptions\nAlternate analysis methods that could apply to this project\nExisting questions that can be applied to this work effort\nHarmonize study elements with other related efforts (example: harmonize Future NAS\nScenarios with other Future NAS studies and outputs)\n\xef\x82\xb7 A roadmap of future research to be conducted in the remainder of the effort in this\ncontract.\nEach Lead Reviewer, and other contributors as needed, captured notes from each document\nthat were deemed to have possible relevance to the conduct of this research.

The research team considered the overall question of expected characteristics of\nthe future NAS, along with more in-depth discussions of specific NAS capabilities, vehicle\ncapabilities, and potential \xe2\x80\x9cmid-point\xe2\x80\x9d scenarios to understand how transitions from current to\nfuture states might be accomplished. Due to limitations of workshop time, efforts were\nfocused primarily on air transport users; in some cases additional sub-scenarios were\ndeveloped later in the research where the defining NAS characteristics were expected to differ\nfor other user groups (i.e., General Aviation, charter, Business Aviation). In some cases more\ndetail was added to the future NAS concepts as the analysis of various link candidates raised\nadditional requirements questions. The results of the workshop and future NAS definitions\nwere documented in the Future NAS Scenarios report. The following sections summarize the\nfuture NAS scenarios, derived information exchange needs, and future communication\nfunctions.\nScenarios were developed based on the needs of the future NAS for safety, efficiency, and\ncapacity. Scenarios were structured by phase of flight, and included departure, enroute,\narrival, and ground operations. Four baseline scenarios were developed during the workshop\nto illustrate the considerations to be used throughout the research effort.\n\n5.1 Future NAS Scenarios\nThe underlying concept for future National Airspace System (NAS) operations was based on a\nnetwork-based Air Traffic Management (ATM) approach, in which the aerial vehicle (including\ncommercial aircraft, corporate and private jets, General Aviation (GA), and a wide range of\nUnmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)) has a high degree of autonomy. Universal ADS-B deployment\nfor all IFR operations, and most VFR operations, was assumed. Overall traffic flow would be\noptimized across the system based on four types of interactions between the aircraft and the\nsystem:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nEstablish/negotiate expected flight conduct;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nMonitor compliance; annunciate actual/expected deviations;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAdapt network to deviations;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nNegotiate / establish new expectations as needed.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n18\n\nThis can either be centrally managed (i.e., a ground function) or distributed. The basic\ncommunication elements are essentially the same in either case under the study concept, but\nthe distribution of traffic changes. For example, in a centrally-managed model more of the\nconduct-of-flight communications would involve ground-air-ground communications, whereas\nin a distributed model more air-air communications would be required. For initial Phase 1\nevaluation a ground-based ATM function was assumed for operations over land masses;\noceanic operations were assumed to involve a greater degree of distributed management and\nseparation, facilitated by ground ATM via space-based ADS-B. The study was structured to\naccommodate straightforward adaptation to varying levels of distributed ATM in future\niterations.\nThe future NAS scenarios defined in the workshop and subsequent updates are summarized\nbelow. Four basic scenarios were developed, to characterize information exchange needs\nduring four phases of flight: Departures, Enroute/Cruise, Arrivals, and Ground Operations.\n5.1.1 Scenario 1: Terminal Operations -

Information exchange needs were categorized into general groups that were not\nlimited to a particular type or class of aircraft. As a reminder both to the research team and\nfuture reader that information exchange needs apply to all types of airspace users, the term\n\xe2\x80\x9cair vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d was used, to include not only traditional aircraft, but other types of current and\nfuture vehicles including lighter than air craft, space vehicles, UAS, hypersonic vehicles, and\nothers.

Candidate link technologies were then vetted against those\nrequirements to measure how effectively the various candidates fulfilled the relevant\nrequirements and their associated functional objectives, as summarized in the following\nsections.\n\n5.3 Data Communication Functions\nThis section summarizes the user functions defined for use within the research effort. Future\nNAS participating aircraft considered in identifying user functions included Air Transport,\nGeneral Aviation, UAS, and Hypersonic aircraft. Operations ranged from commercial airlines,\nto corporate jets, to private pilots, to large and small UASs, to space operations. Hypersonic\nand space operations analysis was limited to Mach 8 and below, and specialized\ncommunication considerations such as space vehicle reentry ionization blackouts were not\nconsidered to be within the study scope.\nEach function was given a Function Code for ease and consistency of reference, categorized by\nthe general type of operation involved. Four types of functions and codes were used:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAAI-x refers to Airborne Aircraft, Inbound Communications;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAAO-x refers to Airborne Aircraft, Outbound Communications;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAGI-x refers to Aircraft on the Ground, Inbound Communications; and\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n25\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAGO-x refers to Aircraft on the Ground, Outbound Communications\n\nFor example, AAI-1 denotes the first function defined under Airborne Aircraft, Inbound\nCommunication, AAI-2 the next, and so on. Function codes for each function can be found in\nthe leftmost column of the tables in Appendix 1.\n5.3.1 Airborne Aircraft, Inbound Communications (See also Appendix 1A)\nThis category includes communications received by aircraft in flight, both from airborne\nand ground sources. Appendix 1A provides more detail on aircraft types: Unmanned\nAircraft (\xe2\x80\x9cU\xe2\x80\x9d), General Aviation (\xe2\x80\x9cG\xe2\x80\x9d), Air Transport (\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d), or Hypersonic (\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x9d), defined\nfor this study as a maximum if Mach 8.\n\xef\x83\x98 AAI-1 Information from other proximate aircraft used by own ship for flight\npath de-confliction, collision avoidance, and wake vortex avoidance.

Each candidate technology\nis summarized from a technical perspective, including its associated architecture\nconsiderations such as interoperability, applicability to multiple user groups, scalability over\ntime and changing industry needs, and the potential impacts of failures on the overall system.\nArchitectures are described functionally, in keeping with the conceptual nature of the study at\nthe current stage. The candidate technologies described are:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nBroad-Band Software-Defined Radio (SDR)\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nDelivery Manager / Overall System Architecture\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nVHF Datalink, including VDL Mode 2 (VDL-2)\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nADS-B and ADS-B Next\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAeroMACS\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAeroWAN\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nSDARS\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nCommercial Cellular Links and \xe2\x80\x9cCloud Communications\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nKu-/Ka-Band satellite\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nIridium/Next and similar L-Band LEO links\n\n6.1 Enabling Technologies\nAs previously discussed, the research team identified two enabling technologies considered to\nbe important to the successful implementation of various link-specific technologies in the\nfuture architecture: Broad Band software Defined Radio (BBSDR) technology, and the Delivery\nManager (DM) function. These two technologies serve as a platform on which various linkspecific solutions are integrated in a system-based approach. As such, while neither functions\ndirectly as a communication link, they are common to the overall success of all.\n6.1.1 Broadband Software-Defined Radio (BBSDR) Technology\nBBSDR technology allows a single radio device to operate across an entire frequency band\nsimultaneously, operating multiple links of various types using Digital Signal Processing (DSP)\ntechniques. The BBSDR Architecture is shown in Fig. 2. The Software Defined Radio (SDR)\n30\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n30\n\ncomponent allows the device to adapt to new types of modulation and other link\ncharacteristics by changing its software, rather than altering or replacing its hardware as in\nconventional radio systems. By 2063 this technology will enable a single receiver to monitor\nthe entire L-Band, or VHF Band, large segments of the cellular communications spectrum, or\neven large portions of the Ku- or Ka-Band, demodulating and outputting link content to the DM\nfrom multiple links over a single high-speed interface. It will also provide the DM with\ndetailed information on link quality and other characteristics for the DM to use in managing\noverall communication effectively. The same is true for transmission, with slightly different\narchitecture.\nThis technology allows the operation of many links in parallel, using a small number of Line\nReplaceable Units (LRUs) for maximum capability at minimum cost and complexity.\nRedundancy is greatly simplified; for example, all L-Band links could be made fully redundant\nusing two identical L-Band BBSDR units.\nA BBSDR-based architecture can enable substantially increased longevity for avionics, and\nreduced susceptibility to obsolescence, through its ability to use software-only updates to\nmany formerly hardware-based link characteristics. Modulation and demodulation, data\nencoding and decoding, tuning and filtering, bandwidth and channelization, error correction,\nand data rates are all examples of link characteristics that can be changed in a wide variety of\nways via software load, or in many cases, even simpler field configuration data updates on an\nSDR-based device. This allows a single avionics unit to be upgraded and adapted to evolving\nsystem capabilities, spectrum availability, and other technologies to a much greater degree\nthan current equipment.\n6.1.1.1 BBSDR Architecture\nA single BBSDR would be able to access all links in a given frequency band. Two or more\nidentical units would be used to provide redundant backup where required. Initially this would\ninclude one BBSDR unit (plus backups) each for the VHF aviation band and the entire L-Band.\nL-Band links could include the current DME, TACAN, ADS-B, TCAS, UAT, GNSS, and Iridium\ncommunication systems, along with the proposed 1030 MHz ADS-B Next, and other services.\nEach BBSDR will be managed by the DM.\nReceive (RX) and Transmit (TX) functions for each BBSDR have somewhat different\narchitectures. TX and RX antennas should be physically separated to minimize TX interference\nwith RX operations. A single BBSDR may also have more than one TX subsystem depending on\nperformance requirements for simultaneous transmissions at high power on different links. A\nsingle TX subsystem can be configured to support multiple modulation and data formats but\ncannot simultaneously support multiple simultaneous transmissions. Configuration of\nadaptive filtering and other mitigation methods will be coordinated dynamically between the\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n31\n\nTX and RX functions to further minimize interference between simultaneous TX and RX\noperations. In general this will apply more to commercial and/or larger aircraft; in GA\napplications it is more likely that transmissions at different frequencies and/or modulations\ncan be temporarily interleaved to allow use of a single modulation, power amplification, and\ndynamic filtering resource to be used to multiple purposes at the same time. A conceptual\nSDR architecture is shown in Appendix 7 for reference.\n\nFigure 6-1: BBSDR Architecture\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n32\n\n6.1.1.2 BBSDR Interoperability and Applicability\nThe proposed BBSDR technology is fully interoperable with current proposed future systems.\nThe SDR capability allows adaptation to a wide range of related systems. Spectrum\ninteroperability with legacy and other systems, such as in the VHF and L-Bands, is addressed in\nother sections. Broadband Software-Defined Radio technology is applicable to all user groups.\n6.1.1.3 BBSDR Scalability over Time and Changing Industry Needs\nBBSDR is highly scalable: the software-defined operation allows a wide range of upgrades and\nadaptations to new link types, deployment of additional ground stations, adaptive modulation\nbased on link quality, and other technical developments. The ability to meet more and more\nchallenging price points is also promising, through the ability to have a single device serve\nmultiple functions that currently require separate, purpose-built equipment, and through the\nswitch from primarily analog to primarily digital components, and resulting increases in\nproduction volume and other economies of scale. Significant portions of the BBSDR can also\nbe common between models for use in different bands; the DM interface, DSP and SDR\ninfrastructure for both RX and TX, and much of the software can be used with different RF\ncomponents to operate in different bands.\n6.1.1.4 BBSDR Failure Modes, Effects, and Backup Options\nThe application of a single SDR to multiple functions inherently increases the severity of failure\neffects; a single SDR failure can cause the loss of multiple functions, links, or capabilities.\nHowever, the solution is also inherent, in that backup equipment only requires a single type of\nLine Replaceable Unit (LRU) \xe2\x80\x93 two or three identical BBSDRs back up all SDR-enabled functions,\ninstead of requiring separate backups for each type of communication, navigation, and/or\nsurveillance radio device. In higher-end aircraft two or three identical SDR units (for each\nfrequency band, i.e., VHF, L-Band, Ku-Band) may be required. For GA aircraft 2 identical units\nfor each band used are expected to be acceptable.\n6.1.1.5 BBSDR Relationship to Delivery Manager\nThe capability of the BBSDR is not limited to the reception and output of the various\ncommunication payloads within its operating frequency range. Its processor will also\ndynamically derive a wealth of useful information about the performance of each link. Signal\nquality, link margin, improving and degrading channels as the aircraft moves (AeroWAN for\nexample), sources and frequencies of interference, and other parameters will be available for\nuse in making optimal use of available communications.\nThe Delivery Manager, described in the following section, will have access to this BBSDRderived information as one of its many inputs in optimizing overall communications. Unlike a\nsimple router, this access to link-level status and trend information gives the Delivery Manager\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n33\n\nmore powerful tools to deliver optimum communication performance using whatever\nindividual links are available at any given time.\n6.1.2 Delivery Manager (DM)\nThe Delivery Manager enables multiple individual links or link technologies to be harnessed as\na group, routing information dynamically across the most favorable link at any given time\nbased on required availability, integrity, capacity, cost and other criteria. This could also allow\nfor the use of non-aviation protected spectrum for certain functions, while still utilizing\naviation protected spectrum where criteria require it.\nAircraft today are typically equipped with multiple separate communication links, with little or\nno interaction. Communication Management Units (CMUs) in larger aircraft provide some\nrudimentary coordination of communication payloads and individual links, but are limited in\ntheir capabilities. Optimized communications using future link technologies can be greatly\nimproved by adding a more comprehensive overall management capability across all available\nlinks. In principle, this function can be described as an extrapolation of today\xe2\x80\x99s router, but\nwith access to a large variety of links, access to status information from multiple layers of the\ncommunication process (link layer included), inputs and outputs in many different formats,\nand responsibility for delivery and integrity of payload information. The research team\ndesignated references to this larger set of delivery / integrity capabilities as the Delivery\nManager (DM).\nThe Delivery Manager is the communications hub of the aircraft. It connects to the various\ninformation systems on the aircraft that use or generate information, and to the various\ncommunication links that the aircraft is capable of accessing. This includes both aviationspecific links and commercial or non-aviation specific links. It is the Delivery Manager\xe2\x80\x99s role to\nassure delivery of communications at or above the required levels of timeliness, reliability, and\nintegrity, at the lowest practicable cost. Where high-speed, commercial links are available, the\nDM may use them to route larger data messages, using encryption or other means to assure\nappropriate integrity. When high-speed links are not available, the DM relies more on lowerspeed, aviation-specific links to assure delivery, even if at reduced speeds. Information\ndeemed to be integrity- or latency-critical may always be routed via aviation-specific links, with\nmultiple such links available to assure delivery.\nFor example, CPDLC messages could \xe2\x80\x9cdefault\xe2\x80\x9d to the VDL-Mode 2 link, but if for any reason\nthat link is temporarily unavailable, messages could be routed via AeroWAN; on the ground,\nCPDLC traffic could be routed via AeroMACS to reduce VDL-Mode 2 system loading. The DM\nhas access to link-layer information such as specific stations currently in range, signal strength\nand noise level, and performance trends for each ground station; for example, which stations\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n34\n\nare fading and which are improving as the aircraft moves. This allows the DM to route via the\nmost viable link at all times, and to strategically switch from one ground station to another to\nmaintain best communication capability at all times. In addition, for some links the DM\nparticipates in link-acceleration decisions under optimum conditions; for example, AeroWAN\ncan switch to a higher-speed method of transmission when link margins are high, minimizing\ndelivery times for large payloads, and back to more conservative methods as the link\ndeteriorates with aircraft movement.\nDelivery decisions are made dynamically and without crew interaction. Crews can access link\nstatus and current routing information, similar to a pilot accessing the GPS constellation status\nusing today\xe2\x80\x99s GPS receivers, but under normal conditions the DM manages communications\nautonomously and transparently to the pilot. It should be noted also that some ground\nstakeholders may also use a subset of its capabilities; for example, an airline dispatch\noperation may use similar capabilities to assure delivery of AOC or AAC data to an aircraft via\nthe various links available at a given time.\nThe viability of non-aviation specific candidate technologies for conduct of flight\ncommunications is greatly enhanced by the Delivery Manager function, because the DM is key\nto their applicability and its scope. For example, cellular technologies may be used for a wider\nrange of functions with the presence of the DM and its ability to encrypt, and to switch to\nalternate links automatically to maintain the required link availability.\n6.1.2.1 DM Architecture\nThe DM coordinates the use of the various specific links based on availability, timeliness,\ncapacity, performance relative to requirements, cost, and other factors. The DM also\naddresses issues such as encryption and security, receipt verification, and probability of\ndelivery across each link utilized from an approval/certification standpoint. A combination of\naviation-specific links and commercial links are available to the DM, including but not limited\nto those described in this report. The DM is also capable of initiating relay communications\nusing nearby aircraft (and their DMs), such as in the case of high-priority messages in primary\nlink failure conditions. Polar route position reports, for example, could be relayed from aircraft\nto aircraft until access to an air-ground link is obtained.\nThe DM presents some overall architecture considerations. To be fully effective, the DM must\nhave access to most, if not all, available ground-air and air-air links. In the aircraft, the DM\nfunctions as the central manager for communications, interconnected with all source and user\nsystems on one side, and each individual link on the other. Multiple links may be provided by a\nsingle BBSDR package, as described previously.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n35\n\nFigure 6-2: Future Aircraft Communication Architecture with DM and BBSDR\nThe conceptual communications architecture for a 2063-era aircraft is shown in Fig. 3. A\nCommunications Bus connects the major components of the system, connecting primary and\nbackup DMs with multiple link-specific devices. DMs have access to both communications\npayload data from each link, and detailed link status information for use in managing link\navailability as conditions change. To the extent that commercial link providers require\nseparate, link-specific LRUs for their services, each such LRU would interface with the DM via\nthe Communications Bus. The addition of multiple redundant LRUs, such as two or three LBand BBSDRs, is architecturally simple, as additional nodes on the Communications Bus.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n36\n\nFigure 6-3: Future Terrestrial Communication Distributed DM Client/Server Architecture\nOn the ground, the DM function must have access to various communication links and\nnetworks, including those with widely distributed architecture such as networks of ground\nstations. Multiple ground users must have means to access the DM function to submit data for\ntransmission, and to receive transmissions addressed to them. Ground user access to the\nground-based DM constitutes another area of Cloud Communications, where different users\nmay access the DM function via various means ranging from dedicated, secure links to a\ndynamic, web-based IP connection.\nA distributed architecture is envisioned for the ground DM, where end users (i.e., an airline\ndispatch office) are equipped with a \xe2\x80\x9cDM Client\xe2\x80\x9d which accesses a \xe2\x80\x9cDM Server\xe2\x80\x9d to establish a\nsecure, authorized user link to authorized DM functions, and perform link selection and\nrouting, message prioritization, security, and other DM functions collaboratively. Different\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n37\n\nground users have different authorization profiles controlling which links may be accessed,\ninformation types which may be sent, encryption and security requirements, and other\nparameters. The DM client associated with each user negotiates via the cloud with one or\nmore DM servers, through which communication access is established and maintained. A\nnumber of DM Controllers manage overall operation of the system, including client and server\nconfiguration management, security, traffic flow management and balancing, and other\noptimizations.\n6.1.2.2 DM Interoperability\nAircraft:\nProposed aircraft communication systems are interoperable with all relevant legacy and new\nsystems. Existing CMUs and DMUs and other current purpose-specific link equipment are\nexpected to have been replaced with DM-compatible equipment before 2063. Interim systems\nmay have a stand-alone architecture with a DM interface that allows upgrade to DM\narchitecture, possibly with reduced DM effectiveness due to limitations in the scope of DM\naccess to detailed link information.\nGround:\nA high degree of interoperability is required for the ground segment, due to the number and\ndiversity of users, user locations, information types, links available, and geographically\ndispersed ground stations and other infrastructure. The ground system is expected to be fully\ninteroperable with all relevant systems.\n6.1.2.3 DM Applicability Across Multiple User Groups\nThe architecture differs slightly from commercial aircraft to GA, but will be applicable to all\nuser groups. Some specific links will only be practicable for larger aircraft, and a higher level of\nredundancy and integration is expected for higher-end aircraft. However, the overall system\narchitecture, and the DM functionality, will apply to all.\nCommercial aircraft typically will be equipped with two or more redundant DM units, crosslinked to maintain current status data for all, with dynamic fail-over from one to another. GA\naircraft will typically have two redundant DM units, with a choice of manual or automatic\nswitch to backup based on user needs and price sensitivity.\n6.1.2.4 DM Scalability Over Time and Changing Industry Needs\nAircraft:\nThe DM will be highly scalable, primarily through software upgrades to the DM itself and to the\nBBSDRs to add/upgrade capabilities of specific links. Backup DM units can also be used to\nmanage some workload in a distributed processing environment as system loading increases\nover the life of the system.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n38\n\nGround:\nAlso highly scalable, with upgrades of both software and hardware being more practicable due\nto easier access, the limited number of ground stations, and the ability to apply cloud-based\ncommunication and routing capabilities to the ground-to-ground user access functions.\n6.1.2.5 DM Failure Modes, Effects, and Backup Options\nAircraft:\nIn the event of a DM failure, at least one backup DM unit will be required. Higher-end aircraft\nwould have three redundant units with auto fail-over. Loss of any individual link is mitigated\nautomatically by the DM function and its ability to switch to alternate links as needed.\nGround:\nThree major types of failure are possible:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nGround Station Failure;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nGround Interconnect Failure;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nGround DM Function Failure.\n\nA failure of any specific ground station is mitigated first by in situ backup equipment and\nautomatic fail-over. Complete failure of a ground station location is mitigated primarily by DM\nfunction, which immediately attempts to access an alternate link. Options include a more\ndistant station of the same link type or use of an entirely separate link.\nFailure of the interconnection between any one ground station and the network results in a\nsimilar situation to that of a complete ground station location failure. Failure of the entire\nground interconnect system, between the DM and all link access points, is prevented by the\ndistributed nature of the ground DM function, and the use of \xe2\x80\x9ccloud communication\xe2\x80\x9d to use\ndiverse links to the various interconnect points.\nFailure of the ground DM function is also precluded by the distributed nature of the DM\nfunction; there is no single DM location, but rather multiple DM entities operating in a\ncollaborative fashion. Link capabilities are distributed across a number of DM servers in\ndiverse spatial and connectivity locations, such that if one DM server does not respond to a\nrequest for a DM client, others do.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n39\n\n6.1.3 Influence of BBSDR and DM on Link Favorability\nBoth BBSDR and DM were assumed to be available to all links at the 50-year reference point,\nwith the exception of current ADS-B and UAT, and current VDL-2. Both are integral parts of the\nfuture datalink architecture envisioned by the research team, and are essentially integral with\neach other as well. In that context, it could be argued that their presence benefits all\ncandidates equally.\nIn fact, there are some additional factors to be considered. Some links may derive more\nbenefit from BBSDR and DM technology than others, such as in relation to steerable-antenna\nsatellite links and links offering more different service types in the same contiguous\nbandwidth. Some commercial systems may be a good fit with BBSDR architecture for technical\nreasons, but precluded by business considerations such as subscription control and fee\nmanagement, or protection of proprietary technology.\nBy the same token, such commercial candidates may derive significant benefit from the DM\ntechnology, a core purpose of which is to provide a link-independent, performance-based\nmethod for providing and maintaining information \xe2\x80\x9cdelivery\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of specific link or\nprovider. This link-independent \xe2\x80\x9cpedigree\xe2\x80\x9d can provide the means to obtain approval for using\nsome commercial links for functions that otherwise would not be compatible with noncertified equipment, providers, and spectrum.\nTaken as an overall system, it is likely that aviation-specific candidates such as AeroWAN and\nVDL Next will derive greater benefit from BBSDR than commercial links such as cellular and\nSDARS. However, the commercial links may also derive greater benefit from the Delivery\nManager than some aviation-specific links. In total, the BBSDR and DM technologies together\nhelp provide a more flexible and capable system, with each complementing the other in\nmultiple ways.\n\n6.2 Link Technology Candidates\nThe following section summarizes each candidate link, its proposed architecture, its\nanticipated interoperability with other systems and applicability to multiple user groups, and\nits scalability over time and changing industry needs. Related failures modes, effects, and back\nup options are also identified.\nThe team considered a combination of aviation-specific options and commercial candidates to\nprovide the broadest overall capabilities and lowest overall cost, while always assuring the\navailability of aviation protected spectrum operations for critical functions. A wide range of\nsolutions were considered, and the proposed candidate technologies fall into three categories:\nextensions and enhancements to current, existing aviation links, re-architecture of current\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n40\n\naviation systems and/or RF spectrum, and the application of new, primarily commercial link\ntechnologies not currently associated with aviation applications, and not located in aviation\nprotected RF spectrum. The first two are defined herein as \xe2\x80\x9cAviation-Specific Candidates\xe2\x80\x9d due\nto their operation in aviation specific RF spectrum. The third is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cCommercial Link\nCandidates\xe2\x80\x9d, being designed primarily for use by non-aviation user populations, typically\noperating outside aviation spectrum, and on a fee-for-use basis.\n6.2.1 Aviation-Specific Link Candidates\nAviation-specific candidate technologies include:\n\xef\x82\xb7 VDL Mode 2 (VDL-2) and aggregated VDL2, herein referred to as VDL-Next\n\xef\x82\xb7 ADS-B based on the current 1090 MHz architecture with a new low power option (1\nwatt or less transmit power for ground operations);\n\xef\x82\xb7 A restructured ADS-B link system re-using 1030 MHz spectrum, referred to herein as\n\xe2\x80\x9cADS-B Next\xe2\x80\x9d;\n\xef\x82\xb7 Space-based ADS-B;\n\xef\x82\xb7 AeroMACS; and\n\xef\x82\xb7 AeroWAN, a new wireless Aeronautical Wide-Area Network re-using portions of the\ncurrent DME/TACAN frequency band.\n6.2.2 Commercial Link Candidates\nAs noted previously, the DM increases the overall viability of using some non-aviation-specific\ncandidate technologies, through its ability to manage their use according to availability,\nintegrity, and cost. These DM capabilities allow expanded use of non-aviation specific links\nsuch as cellular technologies, commercial SATCOM, Iridium/Next and similar L-Band LEO\nsystems, and SDARS, while maintaining required performance and integrity levels. For\nexample, if required weather information is successfully received via SDARS or other broadcast\nmeans in a timely way, no further action is required; if not, the DM may request it via alternate\nmeans such as AeroWAN, cellular technology, VDL-2 or Iridium. Inventory lists of expected\ndata can be sent via AeroWAN or VDL-2 and, if received successfully via commercial broadcast,\nno further communication loading (or cost) is required. AOC / AAC information may be\ntransmitted via a commercial link (i.e., cabin internet) with appropriate encryption and\nsegregation when those links are available. When they are not, the DM switches to alternate\noptions such as VDL-2, Iridium, or AeroWAN.\nCommercial candidate link technologies include:\n\xef\x82\xb7 4G/LTE and future generation technologies;\n\xef\x82\xb7 Iridium/Next and similar L-Band LEO Satellite;\n\xef\x82\xb7 Ku- and Ka-Band satellite systems.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n41\n\n6.2.2.1 VHF Data Link (VDL)\nCandidate links include three types of VHF Data Link: the currently operational VDL Mode 2, a\nmodification of current VDL-2 allowing data broadcast to multiple aircraft, and a re-architected\nVHD data link system not limited to operations within the current 25 KHz channel structure of\nthe VHF aviation band.\nVDL Mode 2:\nThis category includes the current VDL Mode 2 VHF datalink (VDL-2), and the legacy ACARS\nlinks to the extent that they are still relevant in 2063. VDL-2 and the future VHF datalinks are\nexpected to be available to all user segments, including GA, at market-compatible price.\nVDL-2B (Broadcast)\nSame as VDL-2 except with the additional capability of broadcast messages from ground-to-air;\nabbreviated in some tables herein as VDL-2B.\nVDL-Next\nPresent capacity of single channel VDL-2 is limited, and recent saturation problems\nencountered in Europe with current VDL-2 highlight the potential problems in the current VDL2 architecture. Aggregation of a number of predefined RF frequencies with a new connection\nprotocol would greatly increase VDL-2 capability. For this study, an aggregated VDL structure\nbased on the use of a total of 38 channels in the 136-137 MHz band, having 36 data channels\nand two control channels at 25 KHz intervals, was used. One or more channels would also be\nallocated to broadcast data, reducing loading on interactive channels from repetitive\ndissemination of data common to multiple aircraft. A BBSDR architecture allows simultaneous\nreception of control channels, broadcast channel, and assigned interactive channel. This type\nof aggregated-bandwidth VHF Data Link is referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cVDL Next\xe2\x80\x9d.\n6.2.2.2 VDL Architecture\nA single BBSDR unit (TX and RX) can be used to accomplish all communication in the aviation\nVHF band, with one or more backups as needed. Current VDL-2 communication methodology\nwould be accommodated along with future upgrades such as VDL-Next, and the advent of\nhigher throughput link technologies. It is assumed that by 2063 the current analog voice\noperations in the VHF band will have been replaced by digital voice, CPDLC, and other\nalternatives. The DM will manage the information.\n6.2.2.3 VDL Interoperability and Applicability\nBBSDR is interoperable with current VDL-2 and future proposed systems. BBSDR is also\ncapable of supporting current VHF analog voice communications to the extent that it is still in\nuse. BBSDR is applicable to all user groups.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n42\n\n6.2.2.4 VDL Scalability over Time and Changing Industry Needs\nAll current and future VHF data links are fully compatible with Broadband software Defined\nRadio technology, and BBSDR is highly scalable in terms of the adaptability of the BBSDR to\nexpanded bandwidth operations, parallel channel operations, and future modulation\nupgrades. Scalability is somewhat limited by the inherent bandwidth limitations of VHF\noperations and the size of the aviation VHF band itself.\n6.2.2.5 Failure Modes, Effects, and Backups\nThe application of a single BBSDR to multiple functions inherently increases the severity of\nfailure effects; a single BBSDR failure can cause the loss of multiple functions, links, or\ncapabilities. However, the solution is also inherent, in that backup equipment only requires a\nsingle type of LRU; two or three identical BBSDRs back up all BBSDR-enabled functions, instead\nof requiring separate backups for each. In higher-end aircraft two or more identical VHF\nBBSDR units are expected. For GA aircraft one or more units, similar to current VHF\ncommunication radios, are expected to be acceptable.\n6.2.3 ADS-B\nADS-B in this context includes both current ADS-B systems (1030/1090 MHz, and UAT), and the\nproposed restructured ADS-B NEXT system centered initially at 1030 MHz.\n6.2.3.1 Current ADS-B 1090/1030 MHz System\nBy 2063 it is expected that the current 1090 MHz-based ADS-B system will have reached\n\xe2\x80\x9clegacy\xe2\x80\x9d status, but may still be in service in parallel with the new 1030 MHz system (see\nfollowing sections) during a potentially lengthy transition period. This legacy system will be\ncompatible with all proposed new systems, with no mutual interference expected. After the\nlegacy 1090 system has reached its sunset, this spectrum can be re-allocated to provide\nadditional bandwidth for the new 1030 MHz ADS-B Next system long into the future.\n6.2.3.2 ADS-B Next\nA new ADS-B system is proposed that reuses RF spectrum centered around 1030 MHZ in a\nrobust, efficient way to replace all current 1090 MHZ and UAT ADS-B functions. The\nTechnology Candidate Descriptions report includes an overview of the strategy for\ndecommissioning all current functions that occupy the 1030 MHZ spectrum, including active\ninterrogations by ATCRBS, TCAS, and multilateration systems. A key enabler of this strategy is\nthe premise that by 2063 ADS-B will be universally deployed on all aircraft operating under\nInstrument Flight Rules (IFR), and a majority of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) aircraft as well. Some\nrealignment of DME channel assignments may also be needed to aggregate a single broadband\nchannel centered around 1030 MHZ.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n43\n\n6.2.3.3 ADS-B Next Architecture\nAircraft:\nReception of the legacy 1090 ADS-B and UAT signals, and the new 1030 MHz ADS-B Next\nsignals, will be among the multiple functions of the L-Band BBSDR. The DM will support\ndelivery of legacy system data to the appropriate legacy systems as needed, as well as data\nfrom the new ADS-B Next system. Transmission of new ADS-B Next squitters will also be a\nfunction of the BBSDR; transmissions of legacy 1090 and UAT signals, during transition, can be\ndone by legacy equipment or the L-Band BBSDR.\nBoth the legacy and new ADS-B systems will be applicable to both air-to-air and air-to-ground\napplications.\nGround:\nNew ADS-B Next ground receivers can be collocated with legacy equipment during transition.\nADS-B Next stations will connect to users via the DM function. This will allow both Air\nNavigation Service Provider (ANSP) users and others (i.e., airline dispatch operations) to\nbecome \xe2\x80\x9cclients\xe2\x80\x9d of ADS-B ground station output data via their DM client and associated\nauthorization profile if desired.\n6.2.3.4 ADS-B Next Interoperability and Applicability\nThe proposed system is fully interoperable with current 1090 MHZ ADS-B, and proposed future\n1030 MHZ ADS-B Next systems. It is not interoperable with other current 1030 MHZ functions\nincluding active interrogations by ATCRBS radar systems, TCAS, and multilateration systems. It\nis interoperable with DME/TACAN systems with the exception of the possible need to relocate\nsome DME channel assignments adjacent to 1030 MHZ to allow the aggregation of a single,\nbroadband channel centered at 1030 MHz. This new system will be applicable to, and\navailable to, all user segments at market-compatible price, including current users of the UAT\nsystem for ADS-B (primarily GA). Space-Based ADS-B systems would eventually need to be\nupgraded for compatibility with ADS-B Next transmissions at 1030 MHz, but due to the ability\nof the L-Band BBSDR to generate legacy ADS-B transmissions this would not be a requirement\nuntil the end of the transition period.\n6.2.3.5 ADS-B Next Scalability over Time and Changing industry Needs\nADS-B Next is highly scalable due to inherently higher bandwidth than current systems,\nproviding significant room for future growth in the number of users and in the addition of\napplications. It is also scalable due to the inherent scalability of BBSDR technology, as\ndiscussed in other sections. In addition, after the current 1090 MHz and UAT ADS-B systems\nare retired their spectrum can be reused to provide additional growth capacity for ADS-B and\nother functions in parallel with the new 1030 MHz system.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n44\n\n6.2.3.6 ADS-B Next Failure Modes, Effects, and Backups\nAircraft:\nThree primary types of failure modes need to be considered: RX failure, TX failure, and\nuncommanded transmissions (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cstuck mic\xe2\x80\x9d). RX and TX failures are mitigated by the\npresence of backup BBSDRs and DMs and the inherent \xe2\x80\x9cfail-operational\xe2\x80\x9d architecture of the\nsystem. In addition, if the DM recognizes a multiple failure condition, it can attempt to\nestablish position reporting via alternate links, at least to the ATM client for ATM-assisted\nseparation. The ATM can also attempt to initiate similar connectivity to the aircraft if its DM\nrecognizes the failure.\nThe uncommanded transmission condition is also unlikely, as system design will include\nmultiple fail-safe provisions to prevent a single aircraft from \xe2\x80\x9cjamming\xe2\x80\x9d all nearby ADS-B\nsignals. If this condition were to occur, ADS-B operations would be disrupted in the vicinity of\nthe offending aircraft. All associated DMs would attempt to access an alternate link, and ATM\ninstructions via other links would not be affected \xe2\x80\x93 for example, CPDLC messages via VHF\ndatalink would continue to operate. It should be noted that this theoretical condition exists\ntoday with UAT ADS-B, and with intentional jamming of 1090 MHz ADS-B signals. ATM\nprocedures will need to include provisions for this condition.\nGround:\nGround ADS-B system failures are similarly mitigated by redundant receivers and DM\ncapabilities discussed in other parts of this report. In the event of widespread interruption, it\nshould first be noted that air-to-air ADS-B would continue to operate, allowing self-separation.\nATM DM clients would immediately seek alternate links, and could use VHF datalink,\nAeroWAN, AeroMACS (for surface movements), SATCOM, and available cellular links to restore\ncapability. ATM procedures will need to include provisions for this condition, as they do now.\n6.2.4 AeroMACS\nAeroMACS has been the subject of extensive study in other forums, and this report does not\nattempt to summarize that information. AeroMACS is a ground-aircraft system designed for\ncommunications while aircraft are on the ground. The system uses the IEEE 802.16 \xe2\x80\x9cMobile\nWiFi\xe2\x80\x9d standard which provides for internet like connectivity and uses Internet Protocol (IP). It\noperates in a portion of the 5 GHz band designated for aircraft use, and is scalable for both\nlarge and small airports, with a range up to 3 Km. Data rates are comparable to broadband\nWiFi up to 54MB/sec. Applications include AOC messaging, ground traffic control, CPDLC\nmessaging, weather information, and many other applications.\nIn the 2063 system AeroMACS is expected to have been deployed and matured significantly,\nand to be an important element of the future communication system, used by all segments.\nAeroMACS is primarily applicable to ground operations on and near airports. It provides\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n45\n\nwireless networking connectivity for surface clients, including vehicles of various types, ATM,\nairport operations, airport operators, and others.\n6.2.4.1 AeroMACS Architecture\nStrategically located ground stations and antennas provide wireless signal coverage\nthroughout the airport environment. This network of stations connects via the ground DM\nwith various clients including ATM, airlines, aircraft operators, weather information providers,\nand other authorized users.\nAeroMACS operates in the 5 GHz band currently allocated to MLS, and will require one or more\nAeroMACS transceivers to access the system, under the management of the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s DM.\nGround-Mobile Vehicles, with little or no need for alternate links, access AeroMACS directly\nfrom a user terminal device to their onboard AeroMACS transceiver.\n6.2.4.2 AeroMACS Interoperability and Applicability\nThe future AeroMACS will be interoperable with current and proposed systems, with the\ncaveat that as AeroMACS bandwidth needs grow over time, increased allocation of RF\nspectrum to AeroMACS will be required. It is expected that adequate spectrum will become\navailable as legacy systems are decommissioned. AeroMACS is applicable to all user groups,\nincluding not only aircraft but also mobile ground vehicles and other ground users in the\nairport surface environment.\n6.2.4.3 AeroMACS Scalability over Time and Changing Industry Needs\nAeroMACS is highly scalable through assignment of additional spectrum and other channel\nmanagement strategies, upgrades of BBSDR-based access equipment to improved throughput\ntechnologies, and deployment of additional ground stations at additional airports.\n6.2.4.4 AeroMACS Failure Modes, Effects, and Backups\nThree primary AeroMACS failure modes have been identified: Aircraft Equipment Failure,\nGround Equipment Failure, and Interference.\n6.2.4.4.1 Aircraft Equipment Failure\nAircraft AeroMACS equipment failure affects an individual aircraft which, in most cases,\nwill be engaged in surface operations. In general, the inherent aircraft system\narchitecture will provide backup via the redundant DM and link-specific equipment,\nand the DM\xe2\x80\x99s ability to switch to alternate links dynamically. Dynamic backup options\ninclude using ADS-B Next, VHF datalink, cellular, AeroWAN, or SATCOM for\ncommunication. In cases of multiple failures affecting not only AeroMACS but the DM\nand alternate links, removal of the aircraft from service for repair would be required.\nATM procedures will need to include monitoring of the communication status of all\nparticipating aircraft, and practical, safe methods of recognizing and annunciating\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n46\n\ncommunication failures, and of removing a communication-impaired aircraft from\noperations. These procedures will need to accommodate manned aircraft, reducedcrew operations, and unmanned aircraft operations.\n6.2.4.4.2 Ground Equipment Failure\nGround equipment failure presents a relatively straightforward mitigation in most\ncases, through redundant systems and automated fail-operational methods. The\nexception to this is a major outage of some type, such as damage to both primary and\nbackup equipment, antennas or cabling, and other infrastructure. In such an event\nairport surface operations could be significantly disrupted, affecting a wide range of\npreflight planning, traffic flow management, and situational awareness functions\nincluding ground ADS-B, AOC/AAC, and airport operations coordination. In visual\nconditions, the loss of ADS-B capability could be mitigated by visual separation; during\npoor visibility, use of the ADS-B Next airborne ADS-B system is a viable reversion mode.\nFor other functions the DM would switch automatically to other available links,\nincluding VHF datalink, cellular, and even SATCOM to continue operations, albeit at\nincreased cost and possibly reduced pace. It should also be noted that events of this\nmagnitude may cause interruptions of other airport operations as well for reasons\nunrelated to AeroMACS.\n6.2.4.4.3 Interference\nInterference, whether malicious or unintentional, has the potential to disrupt\nAeroMACS-enabled airport operations to a significant degree. As with other failure\nmodes, the first fallback is the inherent capability of the DM, both ground and aircraft,\nto dynamically switch to alternate links when needed. The availability of spectrally\ndiverse link options at VHF, L-band and cellular frequencies, as well as SATCOM for\nlarger aircraft, offers a range of inherent mitigations. In some cases, such as SATCOM,\nincreased link latency must be taken into account, and would potentially impact the\noverall pace of operations.\nIn the event of a major, broad-spectrum RF attack, it is possible that airport operations\ncould be seriously impacted. In such an event much more than AeroMACS would be\naffected, and contingency planning is outside the scope of this study. The necessity for\nATM procedures to include loss-of-communication recognition and mitigation,\ndiscussed in the previous section, applies here as well. For example, in the event of a\nmajor, broad loss of communication connectivity, an \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone stop\xe2\x80\x9d process may be\nthe first step in resolving ground operations issues; air operations obviously present a\nmore complex problem.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n47\n\n6.2.5 AeroWAN\nThe proposed Aeronautical Wide-Area Network employs wireless network technology to\nprovide broadband bidirectional communications between aircraft and ground access points in\nrepurposed aviation L-band spectrum formerly used for DME and TACAN. AeroWAN is based\non the same mobile WiFi technology used in AeroMACS, but adapted for use with aircraft in\nflight. The system is accessible to all user segments, and provides air-to-ground\ncommunications for multiple users and purposes, as well as air-to-air connectivity via routing\nsimilar to existing WiFi systems.\n6.2.5.1 AeroWAN Architecture\nA comprehensive network of ground stations spaced to provide access to all users at\nappropriate altitudes provides wireless network access to client aircraft in flight,\ncomplementing AeroMACS coverage for on-airport operations. Subnetworks of \xe2\x80\x9chigh\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9clow\xe2\x80\x9d ground stations may be required, to allocate bandwidth, power, and coverage to highaltitude aircraft with higher bandwidth needs, versus lower altitude and/or lower bandwidth\naircraft such as small GA aircraft and UASs.\nGround stations are managed and interconnected by the ground DM function. Ground users\naccess the network as clients via their DM client function depicted in Fig. 4.\nAircraft access AeroWAN via the BBSDR avionics, managed by the DM. A wide range of\ninformation types can be sent and received by AeroWAN, ranging from AOC/AAC and weather\ninformation to use as a backup link for key functions such as CPDLC and ADS-B.\n6.2.5.2 AeroWAN Interoperability and Applicability\nAeroWAN is interoperable with all proposed future systems, and with current/legacy systems\nincluding TACAN, DME, and ADS-B with the caveat that allocation of spectrum within the\ncurrent DME/TACAN band will be required during transition. It is expected that by 2063 all\nTACAN operations, and a majority of DME stations, will have been decommissioned. The\nfuture concept of ground-based Pseudolites, which provide alternate position, navigation, and\ntime transmissions to supplement and back up GPS and other SATNAV systems is also\ninteroperable with AeroWAN through simple coordination of channel/spectrum assignments.\nMore likely, the proposed AeroWAN and Peudolite functions would be merged into a single,\nmulti-purpose system with ample bandwidth for both functions. AeroWAN is applicable to all\nuser groups.\n6.2.5.3 AeroWAN Scalability over Time and Changing Industry Needs\nAeroWAN provides significant scalability, through allocation of additional L-band spectrum\nbandwidth and /or deployment of additional access point ground stations. As TACAN channels\nbecome de-activated, each frequency available can be converted into a new channel providing\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n48\n\nanother 4 MB/sec. of capacity, operating in aviation-allocated protected frequency spectrum.\nThis can be continued until there are dozens of channels available within the TACAN band.\nUsing BBSDR radio technology, each aircraft can receive multiple ground-to-air transmissions\nsimultaneously, and avionics can adapt to the addition and reassignment of channels\ndynamically without equipment changes. Higher bandwidth users can also be upgraded to\nadaptive modulation, dynamically switching to higher bandwidth link methodologies during\nfavorable link conditions. The software-defined L-Band radio avionics facilitate this, coupled\nwith the likelihood that large commercial aircraft, serving passenger connectivity needs, will be\nthe most likely higher bandwidth users, and typically operate at higher altitudes where\nadaptive modulation can be used more effectively.\n6.2.5.4 AeroWAN Failure Modes, Effects, and Backups\nFailure modes are divided into four types: Ground Station Failure, Ground System Failure,\nAircraft System Failure, and Interference.\nIn the event of a single ground station failure, higher-altitude aircraft will frequently have\nconnectivity with more than one ground station, and the DM simply connects with a more\ndistant station. When this is not possible, the DM accesses alternate links including VHF\ndatalink, cellular, and SATCOM. In the event of complete loss of AeroWAN connectivity some\nsupport information services may be lost; however, conduct of flight services such as ADS-B,\nCPDLC and SATNAV can still be maintained using other links.\nAircraft system failures are mitigated by the redundant DM and L-Band BBSDR architectures.\nIn the event of a complete loss of AeroWAN connectivity some support information services\nmay be lost; however, conduct of flight services such as ADS-B, CPDLC and SATNAV can still be\nmaintained using other links.\nInterference, particularly in the form of intentional jamming, is expected to be localized in\nnature, and produces a similar effect to the loss of a single ground station.\n6.2.6 SDARS\nSatellite Digital Audio Radio Systems (SDARS) provide broadcast of audio programming and\ndata services to mobile and other users from geosynchronous and Molniya orbiting satellites.\nSDARS is used today to deliver weather and other support information to aircraft, primarily for\nGA users. It is expected that this system or a comparable follow-on will continue to be\navailable for aviation use, and provides a potentially valuable additional link option for GA\naircraft, as well as other user segments.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n49\n\n6.2.6.1 SDARS Architecture, Interoperability, and Applicability\nSDARS uses orbiting satellites for broadcast transmission of predictable data sets such as\nweather information. Reception by aircraft is accomplished via the L-band BBSDR or a service\nprovider supplied receiver (which may be necessary for subscription control), supported by the\nDM. Data to be transmitted is delivered by the supplier to the SDARS provider\xe2\x80\x99s gateway for\nuplink.\nSDARS is interoperable with all current and proposed systems. SDARS is applicable to all user\ngroups, with the possible exception of UAS, where it is technically available but less clear\nwhether information applicable to UAS operations will be transmitted via this type of service.\n6.2.6.2 SDARS Scalability, Failure Modes, and Backups\nSDARS scalability is limited primarily by the business case considerations of the commercial\nservice provider. Substantial additional bandwidth is available in the overall system, but will\nonly be allocated to aviation information broadcast if it promises to generate more revenue\nper unit bandwidth than audio programming.\nFailure of the SDARS aircraft reception equipment, the terrestrial data delivery to the uplink, or\nthe entire system result in the loss of some support information to the flight crew. The DM\nautomatically switches to other, less efficient and/or more expensive links to obtain\ninformation from alternate sources as needed.\n6.2.7 Cellular Technologies\nCellular technologies can be expected to continue their rapid development and capability\nexpansion over the study term. It should be noted that looking back 50 years, cellular\ntechnology was not yet available; the first cellular phone became available in the United States\nin 1983, just over 30 years ago. Thus the 50-year future research term will be nearly 40%\nlonger than the entire lifetime of cellular communications to date. Given the rapid pace of its\nhistorical development, predicting the state of this technology nearly twice as far in the future\nas its total existence to date is a challenge. It is safe to assume that the cellular technology of\n2063 will be far advanced from its current state.\nCurrent cellular communication systems are purposely structured to limit signal coverage as\nclosely as possible to ground users, for technical, regulatory, and commercial reasons. Cellular\nspectrum is re-used from cell to cell to maximize system bandwidth, facilitated by the limited\nrange of a ground-based user device. An aircraft-based device has much longer range due to\nits antenna elevation, and would \xe2\x80\x9cblanket\xe2\x80\x9d a large number of cells in the current architecture,\nseriously impacting overall system available bandwidth. For current commercial cellular\nsystems to have practical use for aviation, these problems need to be resolved. The research\nteam identified straightforward technical and regulatory steps that could enable practical use\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n50\n\nof cellular systems for aviation applications. This opens up potential access to significant\ncommunication bandwidth and related technical capabilities outside the limited aviation\nspectrum. Properly managed by the DM function, this offers an intriguing potential source of\nadditional communication connectivity. In addition to technical and regulatory considerations,\nhowever, commercial services are also influenced by business case considerations. Section 8,\nBusiness Case Analysis, includes additional detail on some of the key business considerations\nrelated to the use of commercial, non-aviation services for aviation use.\nFor future applications in the mid-term study period and beyond, it is reasonable to assume\nthat cellular providers may be induced to implement changes in the current architecture as\ndescribed, in order to capture additional business, particularly in the non-urban areas where\npassengers are able to use cellular devices onboard aircraft. By that time 4G/LTE can be\nexpected to have been supplanted by \xe2\x80\x9c5G/LTE\xe2\x80\x9d, or 6G, or additional generations. The key will\nbe to stimulate the necessary regulatory and architectural changes to facilitate technical\ncompatibility.\nAnother option is to make a portion of current aviation spectrum available for one or more\nproviders to replicate their commercial infrastructure for aviation use. The research team has\nnot studied this in detail, but conceptually it is feasible, and might help offset the commercial\nissues of reserving valuable mass-market bandwidth for a smaller aviation market segment.\n6.2.7.1 General Aviation Cellular Options\nCellular communications using 4G/LTE are, as a practical matter, already in use to some extent\nin GA. Pilot-owned cellular phones are operable to some extent at low altitudes, and are\noccasionally used by GA pilots in flight to access weather information and other conduct of\nflight functions. This is an application where a relatively minor change in ground antenna\norientation could create significantly improved performance for GA users at low altitudes.\nAdditional research in this area would be valuable.\n6.2.7.2 Aviation Cellular Architecture\nCellular systems use large numbers of base stations to communicate with mobile devices in\nclose proximity. To adapt this architecture to aviation use, a small subset of these stations\nwould be modified to include antennas oriented to provide signal to aircraft, coupled with\nmodifications to the system\xe2\x80\x99s algorithms for controlling cell size from the channels allocated to\nthe aviation antennas, and for dynamically controlling channel assignments and bandwidth\nallocations. Modifying rural stations is a logical starting point, as they typically have fewer\nterrestrial users competing for the same bandwidth, cover larger areas already, and have\nfewer obstructions to antenna coverage for distant aircraft users.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n51\n\nBase stations are connected by the cellular provider\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure. A bridge between that\ninfrastructure and the ground DM function provides access to aviation users.\n6.2.7.3 Aviation Cellular Interoperability and Applicability\nWithin the caveats discussed previously, the proposed cellular capability is interoperable with\nother relevant systems, most notably the ground users of the same system. It is also\ninteroperable with all current and proposed aviation systems. The cellular system is applicable\nto all user groups, with the exception of oceanic aviation operations where no commercial\ncellular infrastructure exists. In particular, the GA user would be well served on a technical\nbasis by the small size and cost of equipment and antennas, and excellent low-altitude\ncoverage across a wide range of topography. Airline passenger users could also be well served\nby the inherent compatibility between existing personal communication devices and the\nproposed architecture, and by the potentially large bandwidth available at demonstrably\nacceptable commercial terms.\n6.2.7.4 Aviation Cellular Scalability, Failure Modes, Effects, and Backups\nWith the cellular system, scalability may ultimately depend more on commercial\nconsiderations than technical ones. Technical scalability is high, being based on similar\nstrategies of cell size and spectrum re-use to those applied to ground user services.\nBy definition, commercial cellular communication is considered an alternative to aviationspecific links for any type of conduct-of-flight functions. On that basis its failure effects are\nrelatively benign, primarily impacting passenger access, except in cases of compound failures\nwhere it fails coincident with multiple aviation links. The likelihood of such coincident failure is\nsmall, but would need to be included in implementation planning.\nOne possible exception to the assumption that cellular links are only alternatives for conduct\nof flight information is GA. Cellular systems may be used more heavily by GA for flight support\ninformation such as in-flight updates of weather, NOTAMS, TFRs and similar data due to its\nrelatively low, usage-related cost. In that case the GA user would be compelled to depend on\nother links and services, dynamically accessed by the DM, and/or possibly degraded visual\ndisplays for some flight support information. Cellular communications may also offer\nparticular advantages to sUAS operations, an area that merits further study.\n6.2.8 Ku/Ka Band Links\nKu/Ka-band links typically use geosynchronous (GEO) satellites, which can offer relatively high\nbandwidth communication to larger aircraft, including the oceanic regions. Geosynchronous\nsatellite coverage is latitude limited, and is not accessible by aircraft operating in the polar\nregions. One notable exception is the Iridium/NEXT Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Ka-Band payload,\nwhich will be capable of providing Ka-Band connectivity globally, including the polar regions.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n52\n\nThe research team believes that Iridium/NEXT will be the first of multiple LEO Ka- and possibly\nKu-Band satellite systems, opening a new category of satellite links compatible with all aircraft\nsizes via small patch-type antennas. It should be noted, however, that Ku-band propagation is\ninherently weather-susceptible, and Ka-Band is even more so. For that reason, even with the\nhigher link margins made possible by LEO-based architectures, use at low altitudes, such as by\nGA aircraft and sUAS, will have significant reliability considerations.\nKu/Ka-Band GEO systems use electronically steerable aircraft antennas, to connect aircraft\nsystems via the satellite to a terrestrial earth station which functions as a communication\ngateway. In general, Ku/Ka GEO system steered beam antennas are relatively large, limiting\ntheir use to larger aircraft. Ka-band communications is a viable system for many aircraft\napplications; satellites will provide increased data rates over Ku-band satellites and will use\nsmaller antennas for a given data rate. User costs should be lower than Ku-band. For two way\nmessaging via satellite, round trip messaging delays need to be taken into account for each\nproposed application. In many cases the ground network is actually the largest contributer to\nthe overall link delay. For broadcast applications including NOTAMS, graphical weather, and\nAAC, network delays should not be a factor. For transporting time critical messages, however,\nthe inherent latency of Ku- or Ka-band systems is a significant concern.\nA number of airlines have justified Ku/Ka-Band satellite installations by capitalizing on\ncustomer demands. Inflight Entertainment (IFE) and airline passengers have driven the push \xe2\x80\x93\nand the business case - for faster data rates, leading to Ku- and Ka-Band equipage. Although\nthe majority of airlines charge customers to utilize WiFi, and more customers continue to\ndemand connectivity, very few are willing to actually pay for the service. Currently, less than\n10 percent of passengers purchase connectivity. If every passenger did \xe2\x80\x9clog onto\xe2\x80\x9d these\nservices, performance with currently available data rates would be severely degraded.\nAirlines are beginning to leverage this passenger demand for connectivity to improve flight\ndeck and inflight needs. The traditional means of obtaining such information forces flight\ncrews to rely on antiquated systems such as ACARS. Slow bandwidth coupled with the high\nwork load of flying the aircraft in critical phases of flight often do not allow this information to\nbe disseminated. As cabin wireless becomes available, airlines are using dedicated onboard\nWiFi SSID\xe2\x80\x99s to equip pilots with access to real-time weather on the flight deck, to improve\noperational decision making and reduce block times. Further, flight attendants can check gate\nconnections and passengers can even rebook themselves if necessary.\n6.2.8.1 Ku/Ka-Band Aviation Architecture\nIn the proposed architecture the terrestrial satellite communications gateway would in turn\nconnect with the ground DM function to accomplish link selection from available options,\nmessage routing, and the required security, reliability, and other requirements for conduct of\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n53\n\nflight information. Aircraft link equipment would also be managed by the aircraft DM, and\ninformation routed via the DM to various onboard users including passengers, cabin crew, and\nflight crew. For larger aircraft, either GEO or LEO systems will be viable; smaller aircraft will be\ncompatible with future LEO systems only, subject to the weather interruption considerations\ndiscussed previously.\n6.2.8.2 Ku/Ka-Band Interoperability and Applicability\nThe future Ku/Ka-Band systems are expected to be interoperable with other proposed\nsystems, including the DM, VHF and L-Band links, and legacy systems. Future Ku/Ka-Band\nSATCOM systems will be applicable primarily to larger aircraft that operate at cruise altitudes\nabove the troposphere (and potential weather interruptions), such as airline and business jet\naircraft and larger UASs. GA aircraft and smaller UASs will have very limited ability to support\nthe antennas required for GEO systems, and will find equipment size and cost to be challenges\nas well. Aircraft whose primary operations take place within the troposphere will have limited\napplicability due to weather-induced service disruptions. Personal jets or VLJs may benefit\nfrom Ku/Ka-Band systems depending on their size and operating altitudes.\n6.2.8.3 Ku/Ka-Band Scalability, Failures Modes, Effects and Backups\nFor the compatible users, scalability of these systems is relatively high. Significant bandwidth\nis available, particularly at Ka-Band, and satellite architectures will become capable of\ndelivering improved performance during the study period. By 2063 it is likely possible that\nantenna and filtering advances will allow closer spacing of geosynchronous satellites, with a\ndirect increase in bandwidth as a result. LEO configurations also open a new area of scalability,\nallowing spectrum re-use across relatively small geographic areas within the footprints of the\nlow orbiting satellites.\nThree primary failure modes are involved: failure of the aircraft equipment, of the satellite\nitself, or of the earth station/ground connection segment. Due to their limited reliability at\nlower altitudes, the primary application of satellite systems will not be conduct of flight\nservices, minimizing their failure effects in most cases.\nFailure of aircraft equipment is primarily mitigated by the use of onboard backup systems.\nSpecific backup architectures will be based on the criticality of the system to safe operations; if\nonly passenger connectivity is affected, more limited backup capabilities may be needed. The\nDM function also dynamically attempts to find and access alternate links, again depending on\ncriticality and end-user cost/priority criteria.\nSatellite and ground segment failures may be mitigated by the DM and aircraft link equipment\nattempting to access an alternate satellite, particularly if satellite spacing has decreased by\n2063. If an alternate satellite is unavailable, the DM will attempt to access alternate links \xe2\x80\x93 for\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n54\n\nexample, Iridium or other L-Band SATCOM or, over land, the various VHF, L-Band and cellular\nlinks available. In the case of LEO systems, an inoperative satellite quickly moves along its\norbital track, limiting interruptions from individual spacecraft to a few minutes duration in\nmost cases.\n6.2.9 Iridium/Next (L band)\nThe Iridium system of L-Band SATCOM is used today for air-to-ground communications, and its\nsuccessor system Iridium/NEXT is expected to see increased aviation use. Iridium/NEXT is\nscheduled to become operational in 2017-2018, and was used as the baseline for evaluation of\nofferings of that type. Iridium/Next is also designed to provide a capability for true \xe2\x80\x9cPush-ToTalk\xe2\x80\x9d (PTT) voice communications in real time, anywhere in the world.\nIridium/Next will include not only communication but also a space-based ADS-B payload that\nwill provide direct air-to-ground relay of aircraft ADS-B transmissions in the oceanic regions.\nThis capability will allow radar-like air traffic surveillance in those regions, allowing tactical\nrather than procedural traffic separation techniques to be used, fundamentally changing air\ntraffic practices worldwide, and increasing capacity significantly in many areas. This capability\ncould also change the link loading and other aspects of the current ADS-B links (Mode S and\nUAT) in future applications in the oceanic regions where it will be available. Due to\ncompetition for capacity from ground/mobile users in populated areas, Iridium space-based\nADS-B will not be offered in populated land areas. It should be noted that space-based ADS-B\ncapabilities have also been proposed based on both Globalstar and INMARSAT platforms; for\nvarious technical reasons the XCELAR team expects the Iridium-based offering, called AIREON,\nto be the most viable of these.\nIridium/NEXT also includes global Ka-Band capability (see previous section). By 2063,\nIridium/NEXT will have reached its design life and is expected to have been replaced with a\nnew generation system offering further capability enhancements.\nUser costs on Iridium/Next are expected to be relatively high. Pre-paid phone use is currently\nhovering around $1.00/minute and SMS messaging is $ 0.60 per message. Generic data rates\nare $1.80 per 1000 bytes. As an illustration, a typical NEXRAD weather radar image in\ncompressed format is about 100 Kbytes. If the present addressing scheme is used, this graphic\nwould cost $180.00. Iridium/Next is an addressed system, and does not appear to be well\nsuited to broadcast operations.\nIridium deployment and use on aircraft will continue to increase, but is expected to be used\nprimarily for specialized needs (such as polar communications) and backup capability due to its\nrelatively high cost.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n55\n\n6.2.9.1 Iridium/Next Architecture\nThe architecture for Iridium/Next is a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation with aircraft\nlink equipment connecting to one or more earth station gateways. The DM function on aircraft\nand ground manage the link and information transported.\n6.2.9.2 Iridium/Next Interoperability and Applicability\nIridium communication will not interfere with any future or existing systems, and will be\ninteroperable with all proposed future links. Specific capabilities and backward compatibility\nbetween the Iridium/NEXT follow-on and its predecessor is beyond the scope of this study.\nIridium-based communication will be applicable to all user groups, including commercial,\nbusiness, GA, personal jets, and large and small UASs.\n6.2.9.3 Iridium/Next Scalability, Failure Modes, Effects, and Backups\nThe Iridium/Next L-Band system itself may be subject to growth limits due to its current\nspectrum allocation. However, its successful application to space-based ADS-B and growing\nrole in aviation communication may facilitate either additional spectrum allocations, or a new\ngeneration of similar competing commercial services. For air transport users, its primary LBand use may be as a backup to Ku/Ka-Band SATCOM at high latitudes and/or low altitudes,\nand as a low-bandwidth link for ATM-related messaging. In these applications its scalability is\nmoderate or better. Iridium/NEXT\xe2\x80\x99s Ka-Band capability could provide much higher bandwidth\nconnectivity globally.\nThe Iridium constellation itself is relatively failure tolerant due to its large number of\nspacecraft and their rapid motion \xe2\x80\x93 for any given user, any single spacecraft failure quickly\npropagates to other locations. Aircraft equipment failure could result in loss of ATM\ncommunications in certain conditions, such as during polar operations, and onboard backup\nequipment architectures should be determined accordingly. Multiple, geographically diverse\nground gateways provide inherent backup, particularly in conjunction with the Iridium system\narchitecture and its intersatellite link capability.\nA major failure of the Iridium system, such as from an extreme space weather event, could\ncause significant disruptions in polar and oceanic operations as its use becomes more central\nto those operations. Self-separation of aircraft via air-to-air ADS-B provides one mitigation\nelement; in addition, ATM communication fallback procedures will need to be developed.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n56\n\n7 Candidate Technology Comparison\nThe parallel efforts to identify and characterize future NAS communication functions, and\ncandidate link technologies, converged in the candidate comparison process. Each function\ndefined in Section 5 was used to rank each relevant link in terms of its suitability, on a scale\nfrom 1 to 10. Those rankings were then analyzed in a series of comparative steps to identify\nthe best-suited candidates for each function, under the most relevant conditions. This section\nsummarizes the results of the comparison process.\n\n7.1 Candidate Suitability Ratings\nThis section summarizes the relationship between each function, one or more candidate\ncommunication links, and a relative ranking of overall merit for each candidate from a\ntechnical standpoint. A numerical suitability rating is given for each candidate, relative to its\nsuitability for that specific function, on a ten-point scale based on its capabilities and\ncharacteristics relative to the requirements of each function. Only links with a suitability\nrating of 5 or higher are shown for brevity. In cases where several links had ratings of 5 or\nmore, only the top 3 or 4 are shown, again for conciseness. Candidates are listed in order of\nrelative suitability, and a brief summary of underlying rationale for ratings and other relevant\nranking factors is included where applicable. The same link candidate may receive different\nratings for its suitability for different functions. It should be remembered that this assessment\nis based on technical considerations only; business case considerations were addressed in the\nnext phase of the program, and are summarized in Section 8, Business Case Analysis.\nEach function is referenced by its Function Code, as defined in Section 5 and summarized in the\nFuture Datalink Technology Candidate Matrix in Appendix 1.\n7.1.1 Airborne Aircraft, Inbound Communications\nThe recommended data links below are listed in priority order based on our assessment of\ntheir ability to most effectively and economically accomplish the mission.\nAAI-1: Location/State Vector:\nThree attributes are drivers: latency, system capacity, and communications range.\nCandidates Include:\n1. ADS-B Next\nSuitability 9\n2. AeroWAN\nSuitability 9\n3. ADS-B present implementation\nSuitability 7\n(With phased modulation and low-power on-ground mode)\n4. UAT\nSuitability 5\n(Air-to-air, supplemented by TIS-B ground-to-air)\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n57\n\nRationale: Multiple data links carrying location/state vector information may be\nnecessary in the future to guarantee the continuity of service to achieve airborne\nself-separation. ADS-B Next offers the best throughput and long-term capacity.\nADS-B Next has the capacity to support 4 times as much traffic as the present ADSB, or 6,400 squitters per second within a service volume, supporting increased\nfuture traffic density.\nCurrent ADS-B, when enhanced via phased modulation and low-power ground\noperation mode, is capable of meeting the requirement, with acceptable\nthroughput and potentially fewer transition issues than ADS-B Next, but with\nmuch less capability for future expansion. UAT, when supplemented by TIS-B\nground-to-air, provides a multi-use link, but lower overall performance than either\nADS-B or ADS-B Next.\nIt is worthy of note that current ADS-B has the capacity to accommodate\nadditional traffic without becoming overloaded for many years, if transmissions\nare limited to collision avoidance messages at 1 or 2 per second. It is not\nnecessary to send 6 pulse groups per second per aircraft as in current practice.\nIncreased message rates provide no additional position/state vector information.\nOne feature that should be added is anti-spoofing (coded) preambles into the\nmessage to avoid detection of false messages from hackers.\nAeroWAN provides an alternate method of broadcasting state vector messages. It\nhas sufficient range and enormous capacity. It will be able to support additional\nmessages and larger messages than present ADS-B. AeroWAN operates in similar\naviation protected spectrum to that of ADS-B Next, but uses multiple frequencies\nin a mobile Wide-Area Network (WAN) architecture for greater flexibility and\nbandwidth capability.\nAAI-2, AAI-3: Same as AAI-1, same rationale.\nAAI-4, AAI-5, AAI-6: Vehicle (in) Hazardous messages, AMDAR reports are expected to be\nbroadcast to aircraft.\nCandidates Include:\n1. ADS-B Next\n2. UAT FIS-B with revisions\n3. AeroWAN\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\nSuitability 9\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 8\n\n58\n\nRationale: Messages are expected to be larger than 112 bits, therefore current\nADS-B would not be a good choice. UAT FIS-B message lengths are a\nmaximum of 422 bytes which can support a variety of broadcast messages. If\nAMDAR and Hazmet Weather reports were limited to less than 422 bytes or\nmultiple 422 byte messages were combined, then UAT would be applicable \xe2\x80\x93\nbut UAT is currently limited to lower altitude use.\nAt present UAT FIS-B data is limited to a maximum reporting altitude of 24,000\nft. This is suitable for GA and some turboprops at these cruise altitudes and\nmay also be useful for air transport aircraft during climb or descent. Weather\ndata for air transport aircraft will require support from other data links or\nrevision of the UAT data messages to include higher altitudes.\nFor these reasons, ADS-B Next is recommended, as it can serve both high and\nlow-altitude aircraft, and offers superior bandwidth and flexibility. In addition,\nthe ADS-B Next 1030 MHz data link could easily handle broadcast message\nsizes of 10K bytes and larger. Larger data files transmitted by UAT must be\npartitioned into smaller blocks and transferred slowly or be truncated.\nAeroWAN can support transfer of larger text messages without truncation of\ngraphical hazardous area files. Its WAN-based architecture could introduce\nsome additional latency in routing messages from a source aircraft to all other\naircraft logged onto the network, but this is expected to be minimal, especially\nwith SDR-enabled multi-channel reception of the proposed broadcast channel.\nVDL-2 is not recommended as a single channel data link, as it is expected to\nquickly become congested.\nAAI-7: Traffic Flow Management\nCandidates Include:\n1. AeroWAN\nSuitability 9\n2. VDL-2 Next\nSuitability 7\n3. UAT\nSuitability 5\nRationale: Data is not time critical but acknowledgement is required; coverage\narea is localized to a few hundred miles and perhaps less. AeroWAN is well\nsuited to this type of data, offers robust bandwidth and growth capability, and\noperates in the aviation spectrum. VDL-2 Next can meet the requirements, but\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n59\n\nis more bandwidth and growth constrained. UAT\xe2\x80\x99s inherent spectrum\nlimitations make future saturation a serious consideration.\nAAI-8: NOTAMS Broadcast\nCandidates Include:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nAeroWAN\nSDARS\nVDL-2 Next Broadcast\nUAT FIS-B\n\nSuitability 9\nSuitability 7\nSuitability 6\nSuitability 5\n\nRationale: AeroWAN offers high bandwidth and flexibility, and is compatible\nwith all altitudes of operation. SDARS offers wide-area broadcast coverage, but\nmay have bandwidth limitations; also, use of a wide-area satellite system to\ndistribute regional data has efficiency limitations. Both UAT FIS-B and VDL-2B\nare capable of providing the required information; however, UAT has altitude\nlimitations, and VDL-2B may be capacity limited.\nAAI-9 through AAI-13: Weather information (various types)\nRequired range of information is up to 1000 miles; same information is useable by many\naircraft.\nCandidates Include:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nAeroWAN\nSDARS\nVDL-2 Next\nKa band broadcast\n\nSuitability 9\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 6\nSuitability 6\n\nRationale: AeroWAN offers high bandwidth, flexibility, and potential\nexpandability as traffic grows over time; range of any single ground station is\nlimited to 100 miles, so coverage may not be available in certain geographical\nareas at low altitudes. SDARS has the largest area coverage and high data\ncapacity, allowing more efficient distribution overall. Ka band broadcast has\nthe highest data capacity, and large area coverage, but reception is highly\ndependent upon antenna size, limiting compatibility with smaller aircraft in\nparticular. Ka band can also be subject to weather attenuation, which also\naffects smaller aircraft users. VDL-2 and UAT are not expected to have the\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n60\n\nremaining capacity in 2063 to provide high resolution graphics over a large\narea.\nAAI-14 through AAI-16: AOC, AAC, Optimization data\nFile sizes are indeterminate, latency is modest. ACK/NAC is required.\nCandidates Include:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nAeroWAN\nIridium / Iridium/Next\nVDL Next\nCellular\nKa band ACK/NAC.\n\nSuitability 9\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 6\nSuitability 6\nSuitability 6\n\nRationale: Routine traffic, data latency is not critical. Any link that can support\nroutine traffic across CONUS coverage with modest queueing delay is suitable.\nAeroWAN provides high bandwidth, the flexibility to accommodate traffic from\nboth ATM and AOC/AAC sources, and compatibility with all aircraft types.\nIridium may be more bandwidth limited, but offers global coverage. VDL Next\nhas bandwidth limitations, but is compatible with all aircraft types, whereas\ninteractive Ka band has high bandwidth but antenna size issues for smaller\naircraft. Cellular can address the AOC/AAC applications, given changes to the\ncurrent operating altitude limitations.\n7.1.2 Airborne Aircraft, Outbound Communications\nAAO-1: Location/State vector:\nCandidates Include:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nADS-B Next\nADS-B\nUAT\nAeroWAN\n\nSuitability 9\nSuitability 7\nSuitability 7\nSuitability 5\n\nRationale: The three key attributes are data latency, system capacity and\ncommunication range. ADS-B Next has higher capacity then present ADS-B,\nand the inherent capability to expand capacity through additional spectrum\nallocation which current ADS-B does not. UAT has additional data latency if\ntraffic is derived from surveillance radars. Otherwise UAT air-to-air and current\nADS-B air-to-air are equal. AeroWAN offers an interesting option as a backup\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n61\n\nor fallback link in case of primary link failure; its latency would be comparable\nto UAT when traffic is derived from surveillance radars. It operates in the\naviation spectrum, has high bandwidth, and compatibility with all aircraft\ntypes.\nAAO-2, AAO-3, AAO-4:\nSame as AAO-1. Note that aircraft on ground should use ADS-B at low power (1 watt)\nto reduce airborne spectrum congestion, while allowing for more aircraft to aircraft\ninformation transfer using short messages.\nAAO-5, AAO-6:\nMessage sizes are expected to be larger than 112 bits. ACK/NAC is required. Data\nlatency is not critical\nCandidates Include:\n1. AeroWan\n2. Iridium/Next\n3. Ka band ACK/NAC.\n4. Cellular\n\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 7\nSuitability 6\n\nRationale: AeroWan has high capacity to download significant engine and\nother maintenance data. Iridium or Iridium/Next have similar capabilities but\ndata rate on L band Iridium will be lower. Interactive Ka band offers very high\ncapacity, but has limited compatibility with smaller aircraft and UASs. Cellular\nlinks would meet the requirements, and serve all aircraft types, if current\naltitude operation limits were changed.\nAAO-7, AAO-8:\nCandidates Include:\n1. VDL-2 / VDL-2 Next\n2. AeroWAN\n3. ADS-B Next\n4. UAT downlink\n\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 7\nSuitability 7\n\nRationale: Wind and temperature data represent a relatively small traffic\nsegment; data latency is not critical. Multiple links are capable of meeting the\nrequirements. VLD-2 and AeroWAN are compatible with all aircraft types, and\noffer routing capability to both ATM and non-ATM data users. ADS-B Next and\nUAT also meet the requirements, but offer more limited routing options to\nnon-ATM users.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n62\n\nAAO-9: Special Requests.\nA general category to include various specialized needs such as medical information for\npassenger emergencies.\nCandidates Include:\n1. AeroWAN\n2. Iridium/Next\n3. Cellular\n\nSuitability 9\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 6\n\nRationale: AeroWAN is the best candidate as it can support increasing file\nsizes and high network capacity, compatibility with all aircraft types, and\nrobust routing to non-ATM ground users. Range is more than adequate for\nreporting. ACK/NAC is available.\nIridium/Next can support large file sizes with good transfer rate. Network\ndelays of a few hundred milliseconds are not an issue for these types of\nmessages. ACK/NAC protocol is built in to the two way messaging. Alternately\nIridium/Next Push to Talk (PTT) could be used as a common channel for a\nnumber of aircraft as long as the transmit percentage of each aircraft is low. A\ncontinued issue for Iridium is network availability as satellite connectivity is\nlimited by design although once connected, data transfer rates are more than\nsufficient.\nCellular links would meet the requirements, and serve all aircraft types, if\ncurrent altitude operation limits were changed.\n7.1.3 Aircraft on Ground, Inbound Communications\nAGI-1 through AGI-6: Airspace System information and Atmospherics\nRequirements include support of large number of aircraft at close range, and variable message\nsizes including graphics. Latency requirement is modest, and ACK/NAC is not needed.\nCandidates Include:\n1. AeroMACS\n2. Cellular (4GLTE)\n3. VDL-2 Next\n4. SDARS\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\nSuitability 9\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 6\nSuitability 5\n\n63\n\nRationale: AeroMACS is well suited for this application. Link has high capacity\nand spectrum is reserved for aircraft applications. Many aircraft can use this\nsystem at the same time. AeroMACS information will be localized for the\nspecific airport. It should be noted that there may be airports which are not\nequipped with AeroMACS, but may be within ground range of an AeroWAN\nstation, which could provide similar capability.\nCellular links can provide the same information as AeroMACS but spectrum will\nbe shared by consumers and data transfer rates may lag due to network\ndelays. SDARS also has capacity for graphic files but localized information may\nnot be available and data rate will be slower with greater information latency.\nAGI-7 through AGI-10: Taxi instructions, departure clearance, gate assignments\nCandidates Include:\n1. AeroMACS with ACK/NAC\n2. VDL-2 Next\n3. VDL-2\n4. Iridium\n\nSuitability 9\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 7\nSuitability 5\n\nRationale: Small file sizes similar to ACARS information, ACK/NAC protocol is\nrequired. There may be several messages sent to the vehicle in a period of a\nfew minutes. VDL-2 and AeroMACS are packet switched, and within the\ncapacity limits of both; AeroMACS can service more aircraft.\nIridium is circuit switched, and keeping a channel open during all of ground\nmovement for each aircraft may saturate the satellite\xe2\x80\x99s capacity. Iridium Push\nto Talk networked users on a single frequency could greatly increase capacity.\nMessage initiation may take many seconds to minutes.\nCellular links can meet requirements for AOC and AAC in AGI-9 and -10, but\nare less likely to be deemed acceptable for AGI-7 and -8 messages.\nAGI-11, AGI-12: Information from proximate vehicles on their location and intentions\nLow latency, to include other ground vehicles, high capacity on airport.\nCandidates Include:\n1. ADS-B Next\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\nSuitability 9\n\n64\n\n2. AeroMACS\n3. ADS-B Low Power\n4. UAT\n\nSuitability 7\nSuitability 5\nSuitability 5\n\nRationale: ADS-B messaging is vehicle to vehicle. AeroMACS information\nneeds to go through a router. Latency here is very important; a delay of just a\nfew seconds may give flight crews and ground personnel misleading\ninformation. UAT could theoretically meet the needs of GA-only airports, but\nlatency induced by relay of messages between 1090- and UAT-equipped\nvehicles compromises its performance where there is mixed equipage.\nCapacity of all systems is adequate.\nAGI-13, AGI-14: Wake vortex reports; AMDAR reports\nCandidates Include:\n1. AeroMACS\n2. ADS-B Next\n3. VDL-2\n4. Cellular\n\nSuitability 9\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 8\nSuitability 7\n\nRationale: Reports are broadcast and file sizes are small. Communication range\nis small. Latency is not a significant consideration. AeroMACS is well suited to\nthis application. ADS-B Next and VDL-2 B are also well suited, but may require\nrouting capability of data to ground ATM and non-ATM users. AeroMACS and\nVDL-2B can continue connectivity until out of range of ground stations.\nFor cellular links, pilots will need to stay connected to the network prior to and\nduring taxi maneuvers to takeoff; under current FCC regulations, 4GLTE\ncommunications must be discontinued when aircraft is off the ground. Local\nnetwork coverage could affect reliability.\n7.1.4 Aircraft on Ground, Outbound Communications\nAGO-1, AGO-2: Vehicle position and velocity information\nLow latency, other ground vehicles should be capable of receiving A/C squitter and sending\ntheir own position reports. High total capacity on airport is required.\nCandidates Include:\n1. ADS-B Next, Low Power\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\nSuitability 9\n\n65\n\n2. AeroMACS\n3. ADS-B\n4. UAT\n\nSuitability 7\nSuitability 5\nSuitability 5\n\nRationale: ADS-B Next offers the best combination of low latency, capacity, and\ncompatibility with all aircraft types. AeroMACS offers similar advantages, but\nis dependent on the presence of a ground station on or near the airport,\nwhereas ADS-B Next works directly from vehicle to vehicle.\nBoth current ADS-B and UAT can meet the performance requirements, but\nshare the drawback of interoperability versus latency in a mixed-equipage\nenvironment. Resolution of the interoperability problem requires a local\nground station, and introduces latency.\nAGO-3, AGO-4: Maintenance data\nCandidates Include:\n1. AeroMACS;\n2. Cellular, with ACK/NAC protocol.\n3. VDL-2 Next\n4.

Three levels of result analysis\nwere used, each building on its predecessors:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Baseline Analysis\n\xef\x82\xb7 Function Priority Weighted Analysis\n\xef\x82\xb7 Weighted Score with Obsolescence\nFor each level of analysis, two comparison summaries were developed. One was based on the\naggregate score for each link across all functions for which it was deemed applicable, and the\nother was an average score for each link based only on those functions for which it was\ndeemed applicable. This provides two perspectives:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAggregate Scores illustrate how well each link serves a wide range of functions; for\nexample, a link that provides excellent service for only one of the identified functions\nwould score lower than a link that provides suitable service for many functions;\n\xef\x82\xb7 Average Scores highlight how well each link serves those functions for which it is used,\nwithout considering how broad-based its applications may be.\nThe Baseline Analysis was done based on the suitability scores for each function summarized in\nFig. 5, and Aggregate and Average scores determined for each candidate link. Then two types\nof weighting factors were applied. In the Function Priority Weighted Analysis, each candidate\xe2\x80\x99s\nscore was weighted based on each function\xe2\x80\x99s priority level (i.e., Must-have, Highly Desirable,\nor Nice-to-have). This produces a higher score when a link enables a must-have function than\na nice-to-have one, based on the relative importance of each function to the conduct of flight.\nA 5-point weighting scale was used, with Must-have weighted at 5 points, Highly Desirable at 3\npoints, and Nice-to-have weighted at 1 point.\nIn the Weighted Score with Obsolescence, a second factor was then applied to the Function\nPriority Weighted Analysis scores based on the team\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of each link\xe2\x80\x99s susceptibility\nto obsolescence, again using a 5 point scale. This produces higher scores for those links\ndeemed to be less susceptible to obsolescence, in the context of looking forward from the 50year future research reference point. Those links offering the lowest susceptibility to\nobsolescence were scored higher than those deemed more susceptible to becoming obsolete\nin the 50+ year time period.\nThe results of the various analyses were compared and evaluated in terms of the overall\nresearch goals, and the research team determined that the final step, Weighted Score with\nObsolescence, provided the best overall guidance toward the optimum future solutions. A\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n69\n\nsummary of all the analysis steps and their results is included in Appendix 6 for reference;\nnotes regarding obsolescence susceptibility can be found there as well.\n7.2.1 Weighted Scores with Obsolescence\nFig. 6 shows the aggregate scores for all candidates with obsolescence taken into account. This\nmay provide the clearest \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment case\xe2\x80\x9d perspective of which candidates merit the most\ninvestment in research and development to realize the maximum future benefit. It can be\nseen that the highest ranking candidates, in order, are AeroWAN, VDL-2 Next, and ADS-B Next.\nADS-B Next and AeroMACS have nearly identical rankings; AeroMACS is already the subject of\nsignificant research, the merit of which is reinforced by this analysis.\n\nFigure 7-2: Aggregate Weighted Score with Obsolescence\n\nThe average scores with obsolescence considered, shown below in Fig. 7, show a somewhat\ndifferent order of the same four top candidates, with ADS-B Next scoring highest in is\nperformance within its more limited areas of application, followed by AeroMACS, AeroWAN,\nand VDL-2 Next. Note that both cellular and interactive Ka-band also score well.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n70\n\nADS-B Next, AeroMACS, and interactive Ka-Band all score well in part because they are\npurposely designed to address specific needs in specific areas rather than broad-based links for\nmany applications. AeroMACS only serves ground-based users in close proximity to airports,\nKa-Band serves large aircraft at cruise altitudes in oceanic areas, and ADS-B Next is purposely\nlimited to proximate aircraft awareness functions. Cellular candidates also score well for\nsimilar reasons, being primarily applicable to ground-based uses not unlike AeroMACS.\n\nFigure 7-3: Average Weighted Score with Obsolescence\n7.2.2 Merged AeroWAN and AeroMACS Rankings\nOne special case was also analyzed by the team. AeroWAN and AeroMACS, as currently\ndefined, are based on similar technology and operate in similar ways, but serve two disparate\noperational contexts using two relatively divergent frequency bands. As a result, each scores\nvery well in its own area: AeroWAN in airborne functions only, and AeroMACS in ground\nfunctions only. If these two systems could be merged over the 50 year research period, a\nnumber of advantages would be gained, including commonality of both ground and airborne\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n71\n\nequipment, potentially one less avionics device needed, and increased coverage by using\nairport systems to also serve as AeroWAN ground stations and vice versa.\nThe team opted to model a merged system in the AeroWAN L-Band spectrum primarily due to\nthe broader applications of an L-Band SDR; however, more detailed technical analysis would be\nneeded to formulate a considered recommendation. The aggregate scores under this scenario\nare shown in Fig. 8 below. It can be seen that the \xe2\x80\x9cMerged WiFi\xe2\x80\x9d system outscores all other\ncandidates by a significant margin, due to its broad-based range of functions served coupled\nwith its high bandwidth and other strong performance rankings. This suggests that, of all the\ncandidates analyzed, such a merged AeroWAN/AeroMACS system would serve the most users\nand functions, across all user segments, of any single link studied.\n\nFigure 7-4: Aggregate Weighted Scoring Showing Merged AeroWAN / AeroMACS Score\nThe Gap Analysis input downselect step identified the top three or more candidates for each\nfunction; in each case there were at least 2 candidates with scores of 7 or higher. This\nindicates that suitable performance can be obtained for each function from two or more\ncandidates. As a result, while the Average rankings provide an interesting look at optimum\noptions, which may be useful in choosing between two qualified candidates, in general the\nresearch team concluded that the Aggregate Rankings provide a more compelling measure of\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n72\n\noverall candidate merit, particularly in the context of defining development priorities going\nforward. A link candidate that provides suitable service for many functions may well support a\nbetter business case for development investment than one that provides somewhat better\nservice for a small number of functions. Using the Aggregate Weighted Score with\nObsolescence analysis results, as shown in Fig. 6, the highest-ranking candidates are AeroWAN,\nVDL-2 Next, ADS-B Next, and AeroMACS.\n7.2.3 Minimum Candidate Set to Enable All Functions\nAnalysis of the Baseline scoring data shows that, technically, all identified functions could be\nserved at some level by AeroMACS and AeroWAN. However, there are two fallacies in this.\nFirst, the defined functions do not break out oceanic operations separately from others, and\nneither AeroMACS nor AeroWAN is well suited to oceanic operations. Second, this would\nrequire serving some Priority 1 functions with a suitability level of 5 (AeroWAN for ADS-B\nrelated functions). AeroWAN is better suited to serve as a backup for this high-priority service\nrather than as the primary link.\nAs a result, a realistic minimum candidate set would need to include at least four links for\nadequate service. Based on the analysis, the optimum minimum set would consist of ADS-B\nNext, AeroWAN, AeroMACs, and either Iridium or Ka-Band satellite for oceanic operations. If\nAeroWAN and AeroMACS were merged, only three links would be required.\n\n7.3 Technical Analysis Conclusions\nA total of twelve candidate link technologies were compared against the future NAS functions\nidentified previously in the study, five systems currently in service or being deployed within the\nnext three years, and seven new or significantly enhanced candidates. Using all twelve\ncandidates, all functions were deemed to be successfully enabled.\nThe comparison also shows the important potential role of some future technologies studied in\na successful future NAS. This can be seen in the top four candidates, with the highest\naggregate ratings, all of which are new candidate technologies. The four highest aggregate\nscores (considering obsolescence) were, in order:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAeroWAN\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nVDL-2 Next\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAeroMACS\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nADS-B Next\n\nAnother important point is the impact of two elements that do not appear in the comparison\nscores, as they are not link technologies per se, but are important enabling technologies for\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n73\n\nboth technical and business case viability of the overall system: BBSDR, and the Delivery\nManager. These two capabilities allow much broader application of multipurpose hardware\nthan current architectures, and the seamless use of multiple links. They also are expected to\nextend the service life of communication avionics, due to their ability to implement\nenhancements via software rather than replacement of hardware onboard the aircraft.\nBoth BBSDR and DM were assumed to be available to all links at the 50-year reference point,\nwith the exception of current ADS-B and UAT, and current VDL-2, as discussed previously.\nBoth are integral parts of the future datalink architecture envisioned by the team, and are\nessentially integral with each other as well. In that context, it could be argued that their\npresence benefits all candidates equally.\n\n7.4 Technical Gap Analysis\nThe preceding comparison data allows examination of possible gaps, or functions not\nadequately enabled by the candidate technologies. It can be seen that in the context of\ncurrent technologies only, there are functions that are expected to be required in the 2063\naviation industry that are unlikely to be adequately served by today\xe2\x80\x99s technology without\nenhancements. Analysis of the comparison data also indicates that through the application of\nfuture link technologies identified in the research, all identified future functions could be\nenabled successfully.\nThe research team did not address any hypersonic vehicles at speeds beyond Mach 8. This\nwould include inbound traffic reentering from space. These vehicles are likely to require\nspecialized datalinks tailored to their operational environments, and they will have physical\nlimitations such as radio black-out periods during very high speed flight or reentry periods.\nThese highly specialized considerations were deemed to be outside the scope of this study.\nFor each function, at least the top three candidates were scored; in some cases as many as five\nwere deemed suitable enough to merit comparison. In each case, all candidates scored\nshowed ratings of 5 out of 10 or better, and for each function there were at least 2 candidates\nscoring 7 or higher. This indicates that each function could be successful supported by at least\ntwo of the candidates; this is the primary criterion used by the research team to define the\npresence or absence of a gap. It should be noted, however, that gaps do exist if consideration\nis limited to currently available links only; for some functions there is no current link available,\nand in others current links are not expected to be capable of suitable performance. When\nobsolescence aspects are considered, additional gaps emerge using current technologies\nalone.\nThe team\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is that no technical gaps were identified in this analysis, within the\ndefined scope of the study, that were not adequately addressed by previously identified\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n74\n\ncandidates. The next phase of the study included analysis of business case factors, which\npresents another source of potential gaps, but from a technical standpoint there are no gaps\nthat require development of additional candidate solutions.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n75\n\n8 Business Case Analysis\nThis section summarizes the process used, and results of, the business case analysis phase of\nthe research. Of the twelve link candidates compared technically, nine were included in the\nbusiness case analysis, along with two underlying enabling technologies that facilitate or\nenable all of the link candidates. Three of the lowest-scored candidates technically were\ndetermined not to merit further consideration, both because of their low technical ratings and\nbecause they would be fully supplanted by other, enhanced equivalents: current ADS-B, UAT,\nand current VDL-2.\n\n8.1 Business Case Analysis Approach\nThe research resulted in a new approach to the underlying architecture of ground-air and airair communications as a whole, rather than simple \xe2\x80\x9clink to function\xe2\x80\x9d paired solutions. Two\nfoundational technologies of that architecture are in fact not link-specific at all: The Delivery\nManager (DM) and Broad Band Software Defined Radio (BBSDR) technologies.\nThe rapidly maturing BBSDR technology allows broadband reception and processing of various\ndisparate signals and modulation/encoding techniques in proximate bands using an\narchitecture that allows a single receiver to receive and process a broad band of frequency\nspectrum to decode/encode multiple link technologies for different purposes. This\nsignificantly increases the flexibility of individual communication devices and the system as a\nwhole. The BBSDR concept reduces overall cost, weight of multiple radios and associated\nwiring, and complexity. All of these improvements become an important enabling factor in the\nmigration from current to future technologies.\nThe Delivery Manager enables multiple individual links or link technologies to be harnessed as\na group, routing information dynamically across the most favorable link at any given time\nbased on required availability, integrity, capacity, security, cost Required Communication\nPerformance (RCP), and other criteria. This allows seamless ground-air and air-air information\ntransfer using a number of disparate links, including facilitating the use of non-aviation\nprotected spectrum for certain functions, while still utilizing aviation protected spectrum\nwhere criteria require it.\nBBSDR and DM are core technologies that facilitate or enable a number of \xe2\x80\x9clink technologies\xe2\x80\x9d\neven though they are not links per se. In addition, a number of specific link candidates were\nidentified and determined to meet the functional requirements from a technical standpoint,\nincluding ADS-B Next, VDL-Next, and AeroWAN. These technologies and candidates are\ndescribed in detail in previous reports. In most cases, specific link candidates are implemented\nby means of software configurations in the BBSDR hardware, making their link-specific costs of\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n76\n\ndeployment very low, but each requiring the BBSDR platform to be useful. Thus in a sense, if\ntaken separately, the BBSDR platform business case requires justifying a hardware installation\nthat in itself meets no functions, and each link-specific software definition business case looks\nvery attractive but are all predicated on the need for the platform.\nThis produced a set of potential solutions that in many cases are based on the intersection of\nmultiple technologies, such as DM/BBSDR (L-Band for example), and ADS-B Next, as a group\nthat together offer significant technical and business advantages. Further, within the BBSDR\nconcept each specific link implementation is essentially a software-only addition, which to a\nlarge degree renders the normal business case analysis inapplicable; the link-specific business\ncase that \xe2\x80\x9cbuys on\xe2\x80\x9d the BBSDR avionics would appear to be much more expensive than\nsubsequent software-based added links. Any one link could be placed in that position,\ndepending on deployment, operational, development/approval, and other future factors that\ncannot be fully predicted at this time. Any arbitrary assignment of such order of deployment\nwould unduly skew the business case results for a particular link candidate in relation to the\nothers.\nFor these reasons, the team developed an architecture-based approach to business case\nanalysis, wherein a reference architecture was defined for representative user groups based\non a combination of technologies harmonized within the new architectural approach, and\nguided by the technical rankings resulting from the previous candidate comparison process.\nThree user groups were selected as reference architecture platforms, to characterize the range\nof business case factors that need to be considered: General Aviation, Domestic Air Transport,\nand Oceanic Air Transport aircraft.\nA reference data exchange architecture was defined for each of those groups, which\nsuccessfully addresses all future NAS data exchange functions identified previously in the\nresearch, with appropriate levels of redundancy and reversion modes based on the type of\noperations and regulatory requirements analogous to those applied today. The team then\nestablished typical costs for both current and future communication solutions for each user\ngroup within the context of each reference architecture. For the future architectures, costs\nwere estimated based on the combination of the avionics itself (i.e., the BBSDR\nhardware/installation, DM), and each added link-specific upgrade (i.e., ADS-B Next software on\nL-Band BBSDR). Then the overall solution sets were compared from the business case\nperspective, for each representative user group.\nThe team assessed the relative costs of current and anticipated future certification and\nproduction approval processes, as a function of final product pricing. The conclusion was\nreached that, while future processes may be based on different criteria and implemented in\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n77\n\ndifferent ways, the relative cost of such approvals and related engineering, documentation,\ntesting, and time are expected to be similar as a percentage of final product pricing.\nInstallation costs were also analyzed as a comparison of current and future architectures. The\nfuture architectures offer some installation advantages based on a lower number of LRUs and\nLRU types, and allowance was made on that basis. Some economies of scale are possible in\nantenna installations, but for the most part physical limitations of intermodulation distortion\nand other proximity issues will require provisions for antenna diversity between systems.\nCoupled with the need to address possible failure or impairment of an antenna in flight, the\nresearch team elected to assume that the antenna installation requirements will not differ\nsignificantly between the current and the future architecture.\nRecommendations for most promising technology alternatives were then formulated based on\nthe comparative costs of the future versus the current architecture for each user group, on an\noverall solution basis. Recommendations are summarized in Section 9.\n\n8.2 Underlying Assumptions\nA number of underlying assumptions were adopted to guide and clarify the analysis process.\nThe following three sections summarize significant underlying assumptions applied to the\nanalysis.\n8.2.1 Future Technology Assumptions\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAdvances in basic enabling technologies such as microprocessor capabilities, memory\ncapacity and density, Digital Signal Processors, and RF device performance, all versus\ncost, size and power consumption, will continue to evolve at a pace close to that of the\npast 30 years;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nRF power components will continue to advance in terms of power capacity and cost\nreduction;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nEnd-product avionics designs will continue to see reductions in size, weight, power\nconsumption, and cost, along with increasing technical capabilities, at a rate\napproaching that of the past 30 years;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nRF filtering capabilities will advance, but at a slower rate than digital technologies due\nto physical considerations of RF energy propagation and interaction;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAntenna considerations will require similar allowances for locations diversity,\ndirectionality, and time-coordinated transmit and receive operations for certain\noperations, due to physical considerations of RF energy propagation and interaction\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n78\n\ncombined with the inherently limited physical separation distances possible within a\nsingle aircraft;\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAviation communications will continue to be an especially challenging field in which to\nrealize major gains in link performance, due to the inherently wide ranges of distance,\nspeed, antenna limitations and other factors that affect system link margins, dynamic\nranges, and the relatively limited production volumes for aviation-specific components;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAdvances in GA and VLJ aircraft design and capabilities will increase demand for\noceanic communications in smaller aircraft;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nFuture high bandwidth satellite communication systems (i.e., Ku- or Ka-band) will\nincreasingly migrate to LEO-type configurations, allowing smaller link margins and the\nuse of smaller, simpler and less expensive antennas for aviation applications. This will\nallow increased GA use of Ku- and Ka-Band links, and allow air transport aircraft to\nutilize multi-satellite links for higher bandwidth, increased reliability, and lower cost\nthan current systems.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nIn the future all aircraft will have a much higher level of onboard navigation capability,\nboth from external and internal (i.e., inertial) sources, than they do today. This is\nrelevant to communications because loss of GNSS guidance can be mitigated for\nsubstantial periods of time without the need for Minimum Operating Networks (MON)\nof current-technology ground-based navigation aids such as VOR, DME, or ILS. This in\nturn allows re-use of that aviation spectrum for more broad-based communication\npurposes such as AeroWAN and VDL-Next.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nThe future architectures assume than the AeroWAN systems will include as a core\ncapability a form of \xe2\x80\x9cPseudolite\xe2\x80\x9d capability in AeroWAN ground stations that serves as\na backup to GNSS navigation reception in events of GNSS failure, jamming, or other\ninterruptions. This is also relevant to the cost analysis because it increases the\nimportance of the L-Band BBSDR in maintaining safety; as a result a minimum\nconfiguration requiring two or more L-Band BBSDRs was applied.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nThe future architectures include an inherent radio altimetry function as one of the\nsoftware-defined capabilities of the 4 \xe2\x80\x93 5 GHz BBSDR; this is to allow precision landing\ncapabilities using a combination of either non-augmented GNSS (i.e., without GLS-type\ndifferential correction) or onboard inertial navigation position data, augmented by\nradio altimetry for vertical position accuracy. This allows both a primary and backup\nprecision landing capability (equivalent to Category 3c) without the need for legacy ILS\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n79\n\nor MLS landing systems, and helps to increase aviation RF spectrum available for\nbroader-purposed communication applications.\n8.2.2 Future Technology Cost Assumptions\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nCost comparisons were made in terms of current rather than future dollars, to focus\nthe results on comparative costs without the unnecessary variables of economic\nprojections of future currency fluctuations. Factors were applied to allow for future\nchanges in costs of components, production, product volumes and other factors.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nA nominal avionics LRU price point of five times direct cost, including hardware and\nsoftware development, certification, and production, will continue to be a valid basis\nfor end product pricing;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nComponents developed and produced in large volume for mass-market applications\n(i.e., cell phones) can facilitate significant reductions in avionics cost where they are\napplicable; conversely, it is assume that aviation-specific components, where they\nremain necessary for certain functions, will continue to be severely production volume\nlimited and cost reduction potential;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nPricing for air transport aircraft on a fleet-wide basis assumed a median discount level\nof 30% under list pricing, based on current market practice\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nThe relative cost of regulatory approvals, certifications, and production approvals are\nexpected to be similar as a percentage of final product pricing.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nFor air transport, a typical major airline in current terms was modeled, based on a total\nfleet of 700 aircraft, and a mix of domestic and international operations. Typical\ncurrent equipage costs were defined, along with spares allowances and other factors.\nIt should be noted that the same allowance for spares (10%) per LRU type was assumed\nfor the future configuration, on the basis that the underlying logistics of fleet support,\nspares positioning across the system, and dispatch reliability drivers will remain similar\nover time. However, it can be seen that the future architecture requires a smaller\nnumber of different LRU types, and that is reflected in the model as well.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nFor the purposes of cost analysis, Business Aviation was deemed to be similar to Part\n121 operators in terms of reference architecture and current versus future equipage\ncost. Decision drivers are somewhat different, but in practice the typical business\naircraft is equipped with similar, or in many cases better, capabilities than the typical\nair transport aircraft. This trend was deemed to be unlikely to change significantly over\nthe study period.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n80\n\n8.2.3 UAS Considerations\nUAS aircraft and operational situations vary widely in size, weight, power, and cost, and their\nsensitivity to those factors in avionics equipage are equally diverse. In addition, basic NAS\nrequirements and still being determined, making it very difficult to analyze quantitatively at\nthis time. General Aviation is a good representative case for all but very small UAS, which also\nmay have additional functional and communication requirements for operations at very low\naltitudes, which are also still in flux. Further study is needed into the probable NAS functional\nrequirements in the UAS sector as regulatory guidance and UAS technology mature; both have\nundergone significant movement during the course of the research.\n\n8.3 Reference Architectures\nFuture reference architectures were defined for three representative user groups: Air\nTransport \xe2\x80\x93 Domestic, and Air Transport \xe2\x80\x93 Oceanic, and General Aviation. A \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent practice\xe2\x80\x9d\narchitecture was developed for comparison with each future reference architecture. For\nclarity, these current and future architectures are summarized in the following sections, and\nboth architectures and costs are shown in tabular form in Appendices 2 \xe2\x80\x93 5. Each table\nincludes reference architecture components, costs and LRU count for each current and future\narchitecture, and relative comparisons between them.\nAll future architectures share some common features, as depicted in Fig. 3. One or more DMs\ncommunicate with each other and with various BBSDRs and other link-specific LRUs via a\nCommunications Bus, and one or more of each type of BBSDR (i.e., L-Band, VHF, SATCOM, etc.)\nimplement various specific software-defined links and connect to appropriate antennas. In\npractice, the DM function will be physically integrated with BBSDR units, with one designated\nas primary and the other(s) as backup. Definitions for abbreviations and acronyms can be\nfound in Appendix 8, Acronyms and Terms.\nThe future air transport analysis is based on a hypothetical carrier consisting of a total fleet of\n700 aircraft, with 400 of those considered to be domestic use only, and the remaining 300\nconfigured for oceanic operations as well. This fleet size and breakdown resembles the\nstructure of a number of major air carriers today. It allowed the analysis to consider the\ndifferences in number of LRUs, and related spares cost, for the two different sub-fleets, as well\nas the overall costs of the \xe2\x80\x9cblended\xe2\x80\x9d fleet of a typical carrier of today and the future.\nIt should be stressed that these reference architectures are intended to be a tool for relative\ncomparison of current and proposed future solution sets, and capture a notional\nimplementation of the proposed future data link technologies. These reference architectures\nare not meant to address the many optimizations and tailored architectures that will\nundoubtedly be part of any actual implementation.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n81\n\n8.3.1 Air Transport \xe2\x80\x93 Domestic Architecture\nDomestic air transport aircraft differ from their oceanic counterparts in communication\nterms primarily due to the need for oceanic aircraft to have robust capabilities for\ncommunicating without ground infrastructure to support various links. Thus oceanic\naircraft require one or more high-bandwidth satellite links, where domestic aircraft\nmay not. In addition, in some cases domestic air transport aircraft (regional jets, for\nexample) may be small enough in size to pose significant installation problems for GEO\nsatellite communication systems.\nThe Domestic Air Transport reference architecture for the future system includes four\nprimary components, which between them comprise all required data link functions\nidentified in the course of this research: VHF BBSDR, L-Band BBSDR, AeroMACS/5 GHz\nBBSDR, and a Commercial Cellular Datalink. Table 3 below correlates the future\narchitecture and its LRUs to the current typical configuration of a domestic air transport\naircraft.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n82\n\nTable 8-1: Air Transport Domestic, Current and Future Architecture\n\nDomestic Air Transport \xe2\x80\x93\nFuture Architecture\nLRU Type\nVHF BBSDR / DM\n\nDomestic Air Transport \xe2\x80\x93\nCurrent Architecture\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVHF Comm 1\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVHF Comm 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVHF Comm 3\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVDL-2 #1\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVDL-2 # 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVOR / ILS / GS - 1\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVOR / ILS / GS 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nTransponder 1\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nTransponder 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nGPS / All GNSS\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nGPS 2 / MMR 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nDME 1\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nDME 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nTCAS\n\n3 identical LRUs\n\nCMU\n\nLRU Configuration\nIndividual LRU\n\nDMU\n\nL-Band BBSDR\n\nLRU Configuration\n2 LRUs, primary and\nbackup\n\nLRU Type\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nAeroMACS 5 GHz\nBBSDR\nCommercial Cellular\nDatalink\n\n2 identical LRUs\n\nRadar Altimeter\n\nIndividual LRU\n\n1 LRU\n\nCellular IFE System\n\nIndividual LRU\n\n8 LRUs\n\n4 LRU Types\n\n18 LRUs\n\n11 LRU Types\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n83\n\nIn addition, these LRUs are interconnected by the Communications Bus, and each\nrequires its own antennas and other support provisions.\nVHF BBSDR / DM\nThe VHF BBSDR performs all current VHF radio functions, both digital and analog. This\nincludes current voice and VDL communication, to the extent that they are still needed\nin the future, along with the proposed VDL-Next. Dual, independent software defined\nreceivers process the entire VHF band, coupled with two or more 50 watt, frequency\nagile, software defined transmitters. It should be noted that a single VHF BBSDR\nprovides at least two independent voice and VDL capabilities; in addition, hardware\nredundancy in the form of dual VHF BBSDRs is included in the reference architecture\nfor air transport, essentially providing 4 VHF voice and 4 VDL datalink systems under\nnormal conditions. VHF-based GLS functions will also be performed by the VHF BBSDR.\nThe Delivery Manager function is also integrated into the VHF BBSDR. This function is a\nkey component of the future system, but does not need to be a stand-alone LRU from\nan architecture standpoint, and is expected to be integrated into other LRUs for\nefficiency and cost reasons. It could be integrated into either the VHF or L-Band BBSDR,\nand in fact was included in both in the reference architecture to provide triple\nredundancy provisions. The DM, as part of its overall function, also addresses all\nfunctions currently performed by the CMU and DMU in the current architecture.\nL-Band BBSDR\nThe L-Band BBSDR serves a broad range of current and future functions, and is of\nsufficient importance in the future architecture to merit assignment of triple\nredundancy, particularly in the oceanic configuration. Each L-Band BBSDR includes four\nsoftware defined receivers, each processing the entire L-Band simultaneously, including\nall GNSS signals, ADS-B, ADS-B Next, legacy UAT for GA aircraft), multiple DME\nchannels, SDARS, and AeroWAN. Dual 300 watt software defined, frequency agile\ntransmitters with switchable antennas are managed by the DM to provide bidirectional\ncommunication as needed.\nIt should that noted that from a technical standpoint legacy TCAS could also be\naccommodated, but due to the requirement for specialized antennas and other\nprovisions, this is not included in the 50-year future cost analysis. It is assumed that by\nthat point, over 40 years after the global mandates for universal ADS-B equipage, TCAS\nin its current form will have become fully obsolete. As discussed in the previous\nsection, DM capability can also be integrated into the L-Band BBSDRs, and was included\nin the reference architecture.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n84\n\nAeroMACS 5 GHz BBSDR\nThe 5 GHz BBSDR platform is designed to host two currently known functions that\nreside within that spectral band, and also to accommodate additional future functions\nthat may be defined in that band. Each AeroMACS BBSDR LRU includes dual software\ndefined receivers and transmitters to support simultaneous and independent\nAeroMACS and Radio Altimeter (RA) operations. For air transport two separate LRUs\nare included for redundancy due to the importance of both RA and AeroMACS to\neffective flight operations.\nIt should be noted that AeroMACS capability could have been incorporated into the\nsystem in a number of ways. For example, it is likely that in the future there will be\nsmall, inexpensive stand-alone AeroMACS transceivers or chipsets that could be\nintegrated into any of the other LRUs. However, for air transport applications the team\ndecided to define a separate LRU for various 5 GHz software defined functions,\nincluding AeroMACs. The primary reasons were:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nHosting AeroMACS on a BBSDR platform provides maximum forward flexibility\nfor addition of bandwidth as additional spectrum becomes available and system\nneeds grow;\nThis allows the RA function to also be hosted on the same platform, further\nreducing LRU/type count and again providing software-defined forward\nflexibility for technical advancements in RA technology;\nDefining a 5 GHz BBSDR platform lays the groundwork for implementation of\nother, future software defined functions using 5 GHz spectrum;\nA more conservative approach to future architecture cost estimation.\n\nCommercial Cellular Datalink\nAs discussed in previous reports, the future of commercial cellular systems as far as 50\nyears in the future, as they might apply to aviation applications, is difficult to define in\ndetail from a technical standpoint. The large numbers of potential subscribers,\nassociated revenue, and their effect on regulatory processes can bring about significant\nchanges in the communications landscape as a result of the powerful commercial and\npolitical forces they influence \xe2\x80\x93 far more so than the comparatively miniscule numbers\nof aviation users, even when large numbers of UAS are included. As a result, it is\ndifficult to predict even fundamental technical drivers such as frequency bands of\nfuture cellular operations, modulation and bandwidth management techniques, etc.\nCurrent air transport uses of commercial cellular technology are typically focused\nprimarily on In Flight Entertainment (IFE) uses rather than flight deck functions. Thus\nIFE equipage today is typically based on a commercially-driven business case, justified\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n85\n\nby a revenue segment comprising significant numbers of potentially fee-paying cabin\nusers, rather than a small number of flight deck users who represent an operator cost\ncenter rather and a revenue segment. This is unlikely to change over time. It is difficult\nto predict what the future cabin entertainment / passenger communication\nmarketplace will look like, beyond the fact that it will continue to demand higher\nbandwidth, in keeping with the terrestrial mobile sector. For modeling purposes, the\nresearch team based those architecture elements on a market-driven demand for 500%\nincrease over current capabilities.\nAnother important business consideration is the degree to which terrestrial commercial\ncellular operators may be motivated to make accommodations for capturing aviation\nusers in their revenue base. Cellular operators, by their technical definition, base their\nbusiness on the principle of re-using their RF bandwidth again and again, on a\ngeographical basis, to provide services to large numbers of terrestrial users equipped\nwith purposely range-limited transceivers. Aviation applications are in many ways\ndiametrically opposite to this, with fast-moving platforms covering large distances, with\nrelatively long-range antenna footprints, occupied by relatively small numbers of\npotential service users. While there are some technical options for mitigating these\ndivergent service models, as discussed in previous reports, the ultimate business\nconsideration is the cost / benefit relationship for both provider and subscriber. In\nparticular, the provider will be required to invest in initial and ongoing provisions to\ncapture and serve airborne users, including technical development, regulatory change,\ncapital asset investments and maintenance, and some concessions of RF bandwidth to\na smaller pool of potentially higher-rate service users. Of these, the business cost of\nallocating scarce bandwidth to aviation users may be the most difficult to justify.\nFrom the subscriber side, and the aircraft operator side, there are also hurdles to\novercome. Avionics must be developed and capitalized that are suitable for air\ntransport aircraft, at much higher development and production cost than consumer\nequipment. Typical cellular systems only serve land-based users, so either alternate\nsources of oceanic service will be needed, or the development of oceanic provider\nsystems (i.e., satellite) \xe2\x80\x93 to serve a miniscule subset of the population that justifies\nterrestrial system development. And finally, providers must have a revenue model that\njustifies the opportunity costs for serving the aviation population, resulting in\npotentially much higher service costs for aviation than that for terrestrial users.\nDespite those hurdles, it is likely that commercial cellular systems will be adapted to\naviation to some extent; in fact, that is happening to some degree today. For example,\nseveral airlines use cellular technology to update navigation charts, download FOQA\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n86\n\ndata, or engine health monitoring data, but it is quite limited today and geographically\nconstrained. It is difficult to predict a compelling enough business case for the provider\nto postulate adapted cellular systems becoming any sort of primary or backbone link\nfor aviation operations. As a result, the air transport reference architectures assumed\nthat the future cellular system would be a stand-alone system, rather than being\nintegrated into other BBSDR avionics, and would primarily serve passenger\nentertainment rather than flight deck needs. It was also assumed that these systems\nwould primarily serve domestic rather than oceanic operations.\n\n8.3.2 Air Transport \xe2\x80\x93 Oceanic Architecture\nOceanic air transport architectures are essentially identical to those for domestic\noperations, with one key addition: the need for added connectivity when out of range\nof land-based communication systems, as illustrated in Table 4. This includes both fight\ndeck and passenger applications. Aside from these additional oceanic connectivity\nsolutions, oceanic and domestic air transport aircraft are essentially identically\nequipped, and were covered in the previous section. This section covers only the\ndifferences between oceanic and domestic air transport aircraft.\n\nTable 8-2: Air Transport Oceanic, Current and Future Architecture\n\nOceanic Air Transport \xe2\x80\x93\nFuture Architecture\nLRU Type\nVHF BBSDR / DM\n\nOceanic Air Transport \xe2\x80\x93\nCurrent Architecture\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVHF Comm 1\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVHF Comm 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVHF Comm 3\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVDL-2 #1\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVDL-2 # 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVOR / ILS / GS - 1\n\n87\n\nCMU\n\nLRU Configuration\nIndividual LRU\n\nDMU\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\nLRU Configuration\n2 LRUs, primary and\nbackup\n\nLRU Type\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nVOR / ILS / GS 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nTransponder 1\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nTransponder 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nGPS / All GNSS\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nGPS 2 / MMR 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nDME 1\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nDME 2\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nTCAS\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nIridium LEO L-Band\n\nIndividual LRU\n\n2 identical LRUs\n\nRadar Altimeter\n\nIndividual LRU\n\n1 LRU\n\nHF Radio / SATCOM\n\nIndividual LRU\nIndividual LRU\n\nCommercial Cellular\nDatalink\n\n1 LRU\n\nKu-Band or\nINMARSAT\nCellular IFE System\n\n9 LRUs\n\n5 LRU Types\n\n21 LRUs\n\n14 LRU Types\n\nL-Band BBSDR\n\nAeroMACS 5 GHz\nBBSDR\nKu- or Ka-Band\nBBSDR\n\n3 identical LRUs\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nTo some degree it will be possible to use AeroWAN, VDL-Next and other systems for\noceanic communications via aircraft-to-aircraft relay to land-based systems. This is\nincluded in the proposed capabilities for both AeroWAN and VDL-Next for this reason.\nHowever, this is dependent on the presence of proximate aircraft located at suitable\ndistances between a given oceanic aircraft and a land-based system. Although the DM\nfunction is expected to leverage these conditions when available, it is not reliable enough\nto be considered a primary mode of operation, and is expected to serve more as a cost\nreduction opportunity and backup capability when conditions permit.\nSatellite communications offer the most practical solution today, and are expected to\nincrease in technical capabilities, cost effectiveness, and availability in the future. LEObased L-band communications, such as the current Iridium and Iridium/Next, are\naccommodated in the future architecture by the addition of software defined functions in\nthe L-Band BBSDRs. Ku- and Ka-Band satellite links are in use today for oceanic\ncommunications, and are expected to grow in availability, capabilities and cost\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n88\n\neffectiveness over the research period. Ku- and Ka-Band systems today are based on GEO\norbital orientations and relatively high gain, steerable antennas on aircraft large enough to\naccommodate them. Similar future systems are expected to be available, and offer greater\nbandwidth, lower cost, and compatibility with BBSDR architectures.\nIn addition, it is expected that future Ku- and Ka-Band satellite systems will be available\nusing LEO orbital configurations, allowing much more favorable link margins, lower power\nuplink transmitter requirements, and use of small, lightweight, and low-drag patch type\nantennas. The Iridium/Next system currently beginning its deployment will offer this\ncapability to a limited degree, and it is expected that in 50 years there will be multiple,\nhigh-bandwidth options available. For this business case analysis, future cost estimates\nwere limited to GEO-based systems with antenna systems similar to current offerings, in\nthe interest of conservative cost estimation.\nIt is also technically feasible to serve Ku/Ka-Band communications using the L-Band BBSDR\nrather than an additional, dedicated Ku/Ka-Band LRU. It is not uncommon today for Ku/KaBand systems to actually use antenna-mounted amplifiers and downconverters to convert\nreceived signals to L-Band for coaxial cable transmission to the avionics, and to use L-Band\nmodulators and upconverters to separate High Power Amplifier (HPA) units. Adding two\nadditional software defined, frequency agile transmitters to the L-Band BBSDR for example,\nalong with additional antenna switching, would provide further flexibility, cross-functional\nredundancy, and low additional cost. Upconverters and HPA\xe2\x80\x99s could even be antennamounted, as downconverters frequently are today, decreasing cable losses and HPA power\nrequirements. However, for several reasons this analysis placed the Ku/Ka-Band avionics in\nits own LRU. Those reasons included cost conservatism, maintenance simplicity, and\nseparation of commercial provider systems from conduct-of-flight systems.\n\n8.3.3 General Aviation Architecture\nThe GA architecture is similar to domestic air transport in many ways, with some\nimportant differences. Less redundancy is required, and simpler aircraft systems and\narchitecture reduce overall LRU complexity. GA avionics packaging is typically different\nfrom air transport, emphasizing smaller, lighter enclosures, different mounting\nprovisions, and a growing trend toward integration of communication functions into\nother avionics, such as panel-mounted multifunction displays, due to economies of\nscale and limitations of space, weight and power capacity. In order to avoid the\ncomplications of attempting to predict the 50-year future of GA panel displays and\nother non-communication products, which is beyond the scope of this research, the GA\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n89\n\nreference architecture assumes that all communications functions will be packaged as\nindividual LRUs as summarized in Table 5 below, which communicate with other\nsystems and control/display interfaces via a data bus. In keeping with the team\xe2\x80\x99s\nconservative approach to future cost estimates, the chosen approach does not include\npotential further reductions in communication LRU cost through integration with other,\nnon-communication avionics.\nFor a typical installation, a single VHF BBSDR provides the functions of current dual\nNav/Com units, including VHF voice, VDL, VOR, ILS and Glide Slope functions to the\nextent that they are still needed 50 years in the future. The proposed future VDL-Next,\nGLS, and other VHF functions are also supported as software defined capabilities. Dual\nsoftware defined receivers and dual 10 watt software defined transmitters emulate\ncurrent dual Nav/Com operation when needed, in addition to supporting the additional\nfuture capabilities. The software defined architecture facilitates transitional operations\nas the current VHF systems migrate to the future VDL-Next structure while maintaining\nlegacy capabilities as needed.\nIt is anticipated that by the 50-year future point, very little analog voice\ncommunication, VOR, or ILS systems will remain in common use, with even Minimum\nOperating Networks (MON) of VORs having been replaced with other, more efficient\nand effective means such as CPDLC, digital voice, all-GNSS reception, highprecision/long persistence onboard inertial navigation systems, and AeroWAN-based\nnavigation \xe2\x80\x9cpseudolites\xe2\x80\x9d. For this reason the reference architecture only includes a\nsingle VHF BBSDR LRU with its dual Nav/Com capabilities. In event of the loss of that\nVHF BBSDR LRU from service, the broad capabilities of the dual L-Band BBSDRs are\nexpected to provide adequate backup communication capability.\nTwo L-Band BBSDR LRUs are included, due to their importance in primary and backup\nnavigation, surveillance, and communication. Each LRU includes dual software defined\nreceivers and dual 100 watt software defined transmitters. Each LRU can provide all LBand functions, including GNSS, ADS-B, ADS-B Next, AeroWAN, multi-channel DME, LBand LEO communications (e.g., Iridium/Next), SDARS, and legacy UAT and Mode S\nTransponder functions. For GA, the DM function is integrated into the L-Band BBSDR\ndue to its typical dual LRU hardware redundant configuration; a third DM is not\nexpected to be needed for GA, so no DM function is included in the VHF BBSDR for the\nreference architecture.\nThe GA architecture also includes a single AeroMACS 5 GHz BBSDR, providing both the\nground-ground AeroMACS digital connectivity and the radio altimeter function similar\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n90\n\nto air transport. Based on the low price point expected for this SDR-based unit, the\naddition of RA capability to a GA aircraft, equipped with all-GNSS navigation, adds\nsignificant new options for precision landing aids as discussed in previous reports. As in\nair transport, this also positions the future GA aircraft to take advantage of other\npotential future communication and/or navigation options that may be developed in 5\nGHz aviation spectrum as it is re-used.\nThe application of commercial cellular networks for common aviation use is most likely\nto take place in GA, where aircraft operate at lower altitudes, at lower speeds, and\nusers more closely resemble the mainstream ground-based mobile customer. For this\nreason the architecture also includes a commercial cellular link LRU, which can provide\nvarious data and digital audio communication functions. By linking it to the DM in the\nL-Band BBSDR, its availability can be monitored and leveraged by the DM along with\nother available links as appropriate.\n\nTable 8-3: General Aviation, Current and Future Architecture\n\nGeneral Aviation \xe2\x80\x93\nFuture Architecture\nLRU Type\nVHF BBSDR / DM\n\nGeneral Aviation \xe2\x80\x93\nCurrent Architecture\n\nLRU Configuration\n\nLRU Configuration\nIndividual LRU\nIndividual LRU\n\nGPS / All GNSS\n\n2 identical LRUs\n\nVHF Nav/Com #1\nVHF Nav/Com #2\n\nL-Band BBSDR\n\nSingle LRU, provides\nDual Nav/Com\n\nLRU Type\n\nIndividual LRU\n\nMode S\nIndividual LRU\nTransponder or UAT\nGPS / All GNSS\nIndividual LRU\nGPS 2 / VOR-2 /\nDME/DME\nSubstitute for sole\nmeans navigation\nDME\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n91\n\nIndividual LRU\n\n0 LRUs:\nGA A/C typically\nnot equipped\n\ntoday\nAeroMACS 5 GHz\nBBSDR\nCommercial Cellular\nDatalink\n\n1 LRU\n\nNo Equivalent Link\n\n1 LRU\n\nHandheld Cellular\nWX Service\n\nIndividual LRU\n\n5 LRUs\n\n4 LRU Types\n\n7 LRUs\n\n6 LRU Types\n\n8.4 Business Case Findings\nBusiness case inputs and numerical outputs are shown in tabular form in Appendix 3 - 5 for\nreference. Estimated costs were assigned to each current and future LRU in the context of\neach current and future reference architecture, and results compared in various ways. This\nsection summarizes the results of each comparison, organized by reference architecture\ngroups.\nIn general, future architectures were deemed to be feasible from a business case perspective if\nthe overall cost of the future architecture is equal to or less than the current architecture.\nSimply put, if the new solution costs less than the current solution, it will probably constitute a\nworkable value proposition; the greater the reduction in cost, the more compelling the\nequipage case will be.\nConversely, if the future solution costs more, there needs to be a significant functional, safety\nor operational efficiency benefit to offset the difference; in particular, measurable financial\ngains in operating efficiency would constitute the most effective mitigator to higher cost. The\ngreater the increase in future over current cost, the harder the value proposition will be to gain\nindustry acceptance. In general, an increase of more than 10 \xe2\x80\x93 15% over current conditions\nwas deemed to be a very difficult value proposition for which to gain acceptance.\nIt should be noted that antenna considerations were considered to be a similar for both\ncurrent and future architectures, due to governing physical limitations; for example, in some\ncases different software-defined systems in the same band would require different antennas,\npotentially mounted in different locations on the aircraft, to function correctly. Future\ntransmit antennas will need to be located as far away from reception systems as possible, as\nthey are today. One possible exception to this is future LEO-based Ku/Ka systems, which could\nuse a patch versus beam-steered antenna. For cost conservatism though this case was not\nincluded.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n92\n\n8.4.1 Number and Type of LRUs\nThe total number of LRUs included in an overall avionics package, along with the number of\ndifferent types of LRUs, can have a significant impact on both initial and long-term costs of the\npackage to the operator. Obviously if initial equipage requires the purchase of a larger number\nof LRUs, the cost can be expected to be higher, but other less apparent factors come into play\nas well. Each additional LRU also adds weight, size, cost, and maintenance complexity to the\noverall system. In addition, for air transport, each LRU type drives the business planning for\npurchase, positioning, and repair strategies for spares across and air carrier\xe2\x80\x99s system. Typically\nthe more LRU types there are in the package, the more spares must be purchased and\nmaintained to achieve the necessary dispatch reliability. These factors were included in the\nbusiness case analysis, for both the current and future architectures.\nAnother consideration is the expected reliability of each LRU, along with its contribution to\noverall maintenance costs and strategy. Historically, a higher level of functional integration\nper LRU has had both advantages and disadvantages in real-world maintenance: an LRU that\nperformed multiple functions reduced the number of spares needed, but a failure of any one\nfunction required the replacement and off-line repair of the entire unit. However, in the\nproposed future architecture there are important mitigators to this consideration. First, the\noverall reliability of components and systems has steadily increased over the years, and is\nexpected to continue to improve over the 50-year research period. Both the number of\ncomponents subject to failure, and the technical factors that influence failure, will continue to\ndecrease. From vacuum tubes to transistors, to integrated circuits, to the highly integrated\nmicroprocessor and DSP based architecture of the future, each LRU contains fewer and fewer\ncomponents that are subject to failure. In parallel, the factors of heat, voltages, currents, and\nvibration susceptibility will continue to decrease; typical circuit voltages, for example, have\ngone from hundreds of volts to tens, to five, to three and below over the past 50 years.\nFinally, it should be remembered that the future architecture will derive its ability to deliver\nmultiple functions from a single LRU primarily through the SDR technology, wherein additional\nfunctions are primarily software enabled, rather than requiring significant additional hardware\nfor each function. In this context the reliability of the underlying SDR platform becomes the\ncontrolling factor, rather than the number of functions performed.\nThe team\xe2\x80\x99s research concluded that no additional sparing allowance would be needed based\non the number of functions performed by each LRU, in light of the expected reliability levels of\nthe future technologies and the levels of redundancy built into the reference architectures. As\na result, the future architecture offers some significant cost advantages over the current norm\ndue to a smaller number of spares required for both initial purchase and ongoing maintenance\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n93\n\nand repair. For air transport, a common current industry allowance of 10% was applied to\nboth current and future architectures.\nFor GA, no direct spares allowance was included in the model. Typical GA aircraft are either\nindividually owned and operated, or are operated in relatively small fleets. Maintenance is\ntypically done on an outsource basis to third-party shops, who either stock spares or order as\nneeded. In few cases is the quantity of owner/operator maintained spares large enough to\naffect the overall value proposition of equipage significantly.\n8.4.2 Air Transport, Domestic\nThe proposed future solution set compared very favorably to the current architecture for\ndomestic air transport aircraft. Eight different comparisons were made, examining various\naspects of the overall system, culminating in an overall aggregate comparison of total costs for\nequipage and spares for a reference fleet of 400 domestic aircraft.\nThe first four comparisons examined the comparative cost of the four major types of future\nLRU:\n\xef\x82\xb7 VHF functions only;\n\xef\x82\xb7 L-Band functions only;\n\xef\x82\xb7 5 GHz functions only, and;\n\xef\x82\xb7 Cellular datalink.\nThe other four comparisons focused on different aspects of the overall cost of equipage and\nsupport:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Cost of equipping a single aircraft;\n\xef\x82\xb7 Cost of equipping a 400 aircraft \xe2\x80\x9creference fleet\xe2\x80\x9d of domestic aircraft, including typical\nquantity discounts;\n\xef\x82\xb7 Spares cost for the 400 aircraft reference fleet, including typical quantity discounts;\n\xef\x82\xb7 Aggregate total cost for the reference fleet, including both aircraft equipage and\nspares.\nIndustry-typical quantity discounts of 30% below list price for fleetwide purchases were\napplied, and similarly typical spares allocations of 10% per LRU type were also used. Note that\nsparing is based on LRU type, rather than number of LRUs \xe2\x80\x93 for example, if the architecture\n(current or future) includes 3 VHF LRUs, each LRU is allocated a spares allowance of (10% / 3),\nin accordance with current practice. Based on the technical assessment that the future LRUs\nare likely to have a higher overall reliability that current systems, and that the smaller number\nof LRUs and LRU types will have a positive impact on MTBF and MTTR, these assumptions were\nconsidered to be conservative.\nTable 6 summarizes the eight comparison criteria and their results:\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n94\n\nTable 8-4: Air Transport \xe2\x80\x93 Domestic Business Case Results\n\nAir Transport \xe2\x80\x93 Domestic Business Case Results\nCriterion\n\nCurrent Architecture\n\nTotal LRU Count\n\n18\n\n8\n\n44 %\n\nTotal LRU Types\n\n11\n\n4\n\n36 %\n\nVHF Functions Only\n\n$135,408,000\n\n$6,160,000\n\n5%\n\nL-Band Functions Only\n\n$148,176,000\n\n$53,760,000\n\n36 %\n\n5 GHz Functions Only\n\n$24,640,000\n\n$6,160,000\n\n25 %\n\nCellular Datalink\n\n$12,320,000\n\n$9,240,000\n\n75 %\n\n$1,021,000\n\n$250,000\n\n24%\n\n$285,880,000\n\n70,000,000\n\n24%\n\n$17,892,000\n\n$3,080,000\n\n17%\n\n$303,772,000\n\n$73,080,000\n\n24%\n\nSingle A/C Equipage\n400 A/C Fleet Equipage\nSpares Cost\nAggregate Total Cost\n\nFuture Architecture\n\nFuture / Current %\n\nThe future architecture shows a very significant cost improvement over the current\narchitecture in every category, with and without quantity discounts. The overall aggregate\ncost of the future system is less than one fourth of the current architecture, and this trend is\nconsistent across the single aircraft and fleet equipage as well. Future spares cost is slightly\nlower, at 17% of current cost, due to the smaller number of LRU types required.\nThe future system has a significantly lower number of total LRUs (44%), but of commensurate\nimportance is the lower number of LRU types (36%). The decreased number of LRUs directly\ndecreases the purchase cost of spares; the smaller number of LRU types also will have a\nbeneficial effect on more indirect cost drivers, such as reduced maintenance training (fewer\nLRUs to train for), reduction in test equipment, decreased MTTR due to simpler diagnostics,\nand reduced spares storage and logistics costs. These benefits were not quantified in the\nanalysis, but can be expected to have a significant positive effect on overall life cycle cost for\nthe aircraft operator.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n95\n\nWhen viewed in terms of individual LRU types, the future architecture again shows clear cost\nimprovement, but more variation is seen. For VHF, the incorporation of the currently\nexpensive CMU and DMU functions into the overall DM, coupled with the lack of need to triple\nredundant, limited-function LRUs as in the current architecture, produce a sharp cost\ndifference: 5% of current cost. This is less visible for L-Band (36%), partly because the cost\nreduction benefit for eliminating the stand-alone CMU and DMU has already been ascribed to\nVHF. In addition, the future L-Band LRU requires triple redundancy due to the breadth of its\nfunctions, whereas the future VHF only requires two.\nOf note is the AeroMACS 5 GHz LRU which, even with dual redundant LRUs, shows a very\nfavorable 25% of current system cost. This is interesting, since there is currently no AeroMACS\nequipage at all in the current architecture; integrating the current Radio Altimeter function, in\nitself, produces the future vs. current cost reduction.\nRegarding cellular data links, a number of unknowns are involved which make the comparison\nless meaningful than the other LRU types. As previously discussed, the future commercial\nenvironment for adaptation of high-volume, low cost personal cellular products to aviation are\ndifficult to predict as far as 50 years in the future. The future business model for equipage is\nuncertain, and may involve commercial provider owned equipment onboard aircraft, leasing of\naircraft equipment, and other factors that make comparison to current systems difficult. For\nthe purpose of comparison, the research team assumed that the carrier would own the aircraft\nequipment, and estimated future cost based on extrapolation of current cost and capability\ntrends toward a future performance goal of a 500% improvement over current system\nperformance. This analysis yielded a future cost of 75 % of current architecture cost.\n8.4.3 Air Transport, Oceanic\nAs discussed in previous sections, the oceanic air transport architecture is identical except for\nthree additional LRU categories for enhanced communications in areas distant from landbased communications. The same comparison criteria were used with one category added for\nKu/Ka-Band satellite communications, and the same industry-typical discount and spares\nallowance were applied. An oceanic reference fleet of 300 aircraft was used.\nTable 7 summarizes the eight comparison criteria and their results:\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n96\n\nTable 8-5: Air Transport \xe2\x80\x93 Oceanic Business Case Results\n\nAir Transport \xe2\x80\x93 Oceanic Business Case Results\nCriterion\n\nCurrent Architecture\n\nFuture Architecture\n\nFuture / Current %\n\nTotal LRU Count\n\n21\n\n9\n\n43 %\n\nTotal LRU Types\n\n14\n\n5\n\n36 %\n\nVHF Functions Only\n\n$101,556,000\n\n$4,620,000\n\n5%\n\nL-Band Functions Only\n\n$132,846,000\n\n$40,320,000\n\n30 %\n\n5 GHz Functions Only\n\n$18,480,000\n\n$4,620,000\n\n25 %\n\nKu/Ka-Band SATCOM\n\n$47,040,000\n\n$5,145,000\n\n11 %\n\nCellular Datalink\n\n$9,240,000\n\n$6,930,000\n\n75 %\n\nSingle A/C Equipage\n\n$1,315,000\n\n$270,000\n\n21 %\n\n300 A/C Fleet Equipage\n\n$276,150,000\n\n$56,700,000\n\n21 %\n\nSpares Cost\n\n$16,506,000\n\n$2,730,000\n\n17 %\n\nAggregate Total Cost\n\n$292,656,000\n\n$59,430,000\n\n20 %\n\nThe future architecture again shows significant reductions in cost relative to the current\narchitecture. LRU Count and LRU types are similar to air transport domestic. VHF, 5 GHz and\ncellular all are based on the same data as domestic air transport, and show the same\nimprovement. L-Band scores slightly better at for oceanic than domestic, at 30%, due to the\nincorporation of additional software defined functions that replace current LRUs for HF radio\nand/or L-Band Iridium oceanic communications.\nThe added LRU type, Ku/Ka-Band satellite communications, also shows a significant reduction\nfrom current to future cost. This is due to several factors, including the application of BBSDR\ntechnology, anticipated advances in component performance versus cost, and the probable\nadvent of LEO-based Ku- and Ka-Band communication systems, which reduce required\ntransmit power levels, antenna complexity, and other design requirements. As noted\npreviously, a further reduction on future cost could be realized by incorporating Ku/Ka Band\ncommunications into the L-Band BBSDR, which was not included in this analysis.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n97\n\nOverall cost reduction from current to future is slightly better than domestic air transport, due\nto the added improvements in L-Band and Ku/Ka-Band previously discussed. Aggregate total\ncost for the 300 aircraft reference fleet is 20% of current architecture, an improvement from\nthe 24% for domestic air transport.\n8.4.4 General Aviation\nThe General Aviation analysis is much simpler than those for air transport, due to the simpler\nreference architecture, reduced number of required functions and redundancies, the lack of\nfleet discounts and oceanic configurations, and the absence of spares as a significant\nconsideration. As previously discussed, spares were not considered because GA fleets are\ntypically single aircraft or small fleets with limited opportunities for economies of scale; typical\nmaintenance scenarios often rely on outsourcing to a commercial provider who orders on\ndemand or handles stocking in accordance with their overall business model. On that basis\nspares were deemed to be a negligible business case consideration for GA.\nA total of seven comparison criteria were used, structured similar to the air transport analyses.\nLRU count is compared in the same way as air transport, although with the lack of sparing as a\nconsideration, the impact of the number of LRU types is insignificant. Only five cost criteria\nwere used: the four major LRU types, and aggregate total cost for a single aircraft.\nTable 8 summarizes the eight comparison criteria and their results:\nTable 8-6: General Aviation Business Case Results\n\nGeneral Aviation Business Case Results\nCriterion\n\nCurrent Architecture\n\nFuture Architecture\n\nFuture / Current %\n\nTotal LRU Count\n\n7\n\n5\n\n71 %\n\nTotal LRU Types\n\n6\n\n4\n\n67 %\n\nVHF Functions Only\n\n$11,000\n\n$5,000\n\n45 %\n\nL-Band Functions Only\n\n$31,500\n\n$24,000\n\n76 %\n\n5 GHz Functions Only\n\nN/A\n\n$5,000\n\nN/A\n\nCellular Datalink\n\n$1,700\n\n$1,000\n\n59 %\n\nAggregate Total Cost\n\n$44,200\n\n$35,000\n\n79 %\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n98\n\nAll categories except one show a clear and advantageous reduction in cost over the current\narchitecture, although of a much lesser magnitude than seen in air transport. This is due in\nlarge part to the much smaller number of LRUs, functions, and costs for GA equipage than air\ntransport. The reduced LRU count (71 %) does offer advantages in reduced space, weight, and\npower consumption, in addition to the simple reduction in cost from acquiring fewer devices.\nThe one exception to clear cost reduction is due to the lack of any current analogous function\nor system in GA to the AeroMACS/5 GHz technology, so no direct comparison could be made.\nMost GA aircraft are not equipped with Radio Altimeters, and AeroMACS has not yet been\ndeployed operationally in any user segment.\nThe largest LRU-specific improvement is the VHF BBSDR, at 45% of current architecture.\nAlthough the future VHF LRU does provide all functions of dual Nav/Com installations,\nhowever, it should be noted that the cost reduction is largely due to its single hardware LRU\nconfiguration, whereas the current architecture includes dual LRUs. It should also be noted\nthat the VHF BBSDR also provides dual VDL Mode 2 and/or VDL-Next capability, along with\nexpandability to include other software-defined future VHF functions, which the current\narchitecture does not.\nThe L-Band BBSDR shows a cost of 76% of the current architecture, even though there is no\nequivalent to several future L-Band functions in the current architecture. It is worthy of note,\nfor example, that fully compliant ADS-B capability is not included in the current architecture, as\nmost GA aircraft have yet to be equipped. An intermediate assumption was made instead,\nincluding a Mode S transponder. Also, as previously discussed, the current GA architecture\ndoes not include DME, another L-Band function. Nonetheless, the L-Band BBSDR is able to\naddress multiple current functions including GNSS, Transponder (or UAT, which is also L-Band),\nand SDARS, along with providing backup functions to the single VHF LRU via AeroWAN. The\nnecessity for dual redundant L-Band LRUs, due to the broad scope of its functions, offsets the\nartificially favorable cost score of the VHF BBSDR.\nAs with air transport, definitive comparison of commercial cellular links is hampered by both\nfuture uncertainties and the lack of current equipage with avionics-type cellular links. In the\ncurrent architecture, cellular communication is often accomplished using handheld personal\ndevices using existing ground-based infrastructure, mainly at low altitudes. Some derivatives\nof corporate and airline-oriented cellular services are becoming available, but volumes are low,\nmaking cost estimates unreliable. It should be noted that the potential for adoption of\ncommercial cellular links for conduct of flight related functions may be much greater for GA\nthan for air transport. Future cellular systems may require smaller adaptations for airborne\nuse at low altitude, and usage-measured commercial fees may be more palatable for\noccasional GA operations than for continuous, high-volume airline operations. Thus the\n99\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n99\n\nlikelihood of aircraft-resident devices, connected via the DM to other flight deck systems, may\nbe much greater for GA than air transport. For these reasons the research team felt it was\nimportant to define estimates for both current and future costs. A production volume of\n100,000 units, developed primarily using components and subsystems from consumer\nproducts with volumes in the millions of units, was used to compare current and future costs.\nA modest reduction of 59% resulted from that analysis.\nOverall, the future architecture GA business case is quite favorable compared to the current\narchitecture, indicating over 20% reduction over current cost (future cost being 79% of current\ncost) \xe2\x80\x93 a favorable shift for a very cost-conscious market segment. In addition, the future\narchitecture offers significant non-financial gains over the current system. There is also a\nsignificant gain in capabilities, functions, and redundancy gained for that decreased cost;\nexamples include:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nVHF datalink (redundant) \xe2\x80\x93 VDL M2 and/or VDL-Next\nDual all-GNSS navigation reception\nFunctional equivalent of 4 VHF Nav/Coms during normal conditions\nDual DME capability; ability to participate in DME/DME backup of GNSS\nDual ADS-B systems\nFully interoperable ADS-B system with all other user segments, no ground segment\nneeded\nAeroWAN capability (does not exist now)\nAeroMACS capability (does not exist now)\nRadio Altimeter \xe2\x80\x93 improved safety, potential for new precision approach options\nAll major functions software defined for upgradability and transitional compatibility\n\n8.4.5 Commercial Considerations for Cloud Communication\nThe use of commercial services for aviation applications requires that both technical and\ncommercial criteria be satisfied to achieve success. In some cases the commercial or business\ncase considerations needed to induce a commercial (i.e., terrestrial services) operator to make\nthe service available for aviation users may be more challenging than the technical ones.\nCommercial communication service providers are fundamentally in the business of turning\nbandwidth and infrastructure into revenue, and generally allocate those resources where the\ngreatest revenue is expected, at the lowest risk. Aviation applications may not compare\nfavorably to other market segments from a business case standpoint for several reasons,\nincluding:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nLimited market size compared to \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d terrestrial markets\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n100\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nPerceived high liability of aviation applications for conduct-of-flight use\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nCost of specialized infrastructure to access aviation markets\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nRelative Market Size\n\nOn average, the number of aircraft that are likely to be served by any given cellular station is\nvery small compared to the number of ground-based mobile phone users served by the same\nstation. To accommodate the aviation users, some business incentive is needed to balance\nthat disparity, and this is exacerbated by any specialized infrastructure needed to access those\nusers. The most obvious incentive is rate structure, charging proportionately higher rates for\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cminority\xe2\x80\x9d airborne users. While this may solve the problem, it also changes the incentive\nbasis for aviation to use cellular services \xe2\x80\x93 the more expensive it is, the less attractive it may\nbecome relative to other link options.\n8.4.5.1 Aviation Liability Climate\nAviation applications, particularly where any connection with conduct of flight is involved, are\nperceived to have a significantly higher potential legal liability risk than service to terrestrial\nmobile users, and this is unlikely to change substantially over the study period, without\nfocused effort. There are electronic component manufacturers today who prohibit the use of\ncomponents from use in avionics for this reason. Commercial service operators will need to\neither justify this higher risk profile from a business perspective, or find ways to mitigate the\nrisk through legal, legislative, or other means. Limiting use to passenger services is an option,\nbut does not serve the goal of having the service as a \xe2\x80\x9ccloud communication\xe2\x80\x9d link option from\nan overall aviation industry standpoint.\n8.4.5.2 Infrastructure Costs\nThe technical steps required to adapt current cellular systems to aviation use include addition\nof antennas and associated equipment, and alterations to system software and algorithms.\nThese infrastructure needs represent a capital investment by the service provider, who again\nneeds to justify that investment with commensurate revenue; aviation user service fees may\nneed to be adjusted accordingly.\nFor high altitude use, such as by commercial aircraft, a relatively small number of ground\nstations would need to be modified. Amortizing a relatively small infrastructure investment\nagainst the number of airline passenger users could well provide a workable fee structure and\nbusiness case. However, for GA use a much larger number of modified ground stations would\nbe needed, due to the lower altitude operations. Unfortunately, this higher infrastructure\ninvestment would need to be amortized across a much smaller population of GA users than\nthe airline case, resulting in a much less attractive business case. This is particularly\nunfortunate since GA aircraft have fewer alternatives than airline aircraft (e.g., Ku/Ka-Band\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n101\n\nSATCOM) due to limitations on antenna size, equipment size/weight, and cost, and would\narguably benefit more from having the cellular option.\nThese business case considerations may be the deciding factor in determining which links are\nactually practical for future aviation use, and must be carefully weighed in the evaluation\nprocess.\n\n8.5 Business Case Gap Analysis\nOverall, the business case analysis established the financial viability of the future architectures\nin comparison to current practice. This was established as the primary criterion: if the industry\nhas demonstrated the viability of the current business case through widespread adoption of\nthe current architectures, and the future architectures are less expensive while delivering\nequivalent or greater capabilities, then the proposed future architecture has a high probability\nof business acceptance. In most cases the future architectures were found not only to be less\nexpensive, but substantially less expensive. Previous research has established that the\nproposed future architectures analyzed herein are fully viable from various technical\nstandpoints as well. In all cases, the future architectures also deliver not only equivalent or\ngreater capabilities, but significantly greater capabilities. Thus it is reasonable to conclude that\nthe proposed future solution set can be expected to be viable from a business perspective, and\nleaves no gaps or unmet needs within the construct of the defined future NAS functions.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n102\n\n9 Most Promising Technologies\nThe convergence of the technical and business analysis efforts research allows the\nidentification of the overall most promising technology alternatives for the ground-air and airair datalink needs of the future aviation system. The candidates best suited technically were\nidentified in the Section 7, and were used as inputs to the business case analysis summarized\nin Section 8. The business case analysis validated the viability of those candidates from a\nbusiness perspective, and does not identify any gaps, unmet needs, or unworkable solutions.\nAmong those candidate solutions, the most promising have been identified based on several\ncriteria:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Breadth of applicability;\n\xef\x82\xb7 Scope of impact on future system capabilities;\n\xef\x82\xb7 Cost / benefit contribution to the overall business case, and\n\xef\x82\xb7 Long-term growth and adaptation potential.\nIdentifying and ranking the most promising of the technologies that make up the future\narchitectures is complicated by the fact that some represent specific links, and others are\nenabling or underlying technologies that enable or facilitate multiple different links. The\nresults are summarized in this section, and comprise a mix of both types. Each technology\ndescribed in this section has been summarized in technical detail in previous sections. This\nsection is focused on the reasons for their \xe2\x80\x9cmost promising\xe2\x80\x9d selection and ranking.\nTwo enabling technologies top the list, based on their breadth of applicability and fundamental\ncontributions to system capabilities, cost/benefit, and future growth and adaptability: BBSDR,\nand DM. Following those are a number of specific link types: AeroWAN/AeroMACS/Merged\nWiFi, ADS-B-Next, VDL-Next, and LEO Ku/Ka-Band SATCOM.\n\n9.1 BBSDR\nBroad Band Software Defined Radio (BBSDR) technology is a key enabling platform for early all\nof the proposed future link candidates. BBSDR enables a single LRU to host multiple software\ndefined links simultaneously, establishing a new and much lower price/capability point for\navionics. Its software-driven nature also greatly facilitates both initial transition from current\nto future architectures, and future growth and adaptation to added bandwidth, the advent of\nnew and more efficient modulations and other link innovations, and protection from\nobsolescence. BBSDR technology is applicable to all frequency bands currently allocated to\naviation, including VHF, L-Band, and the 5 GHz band used by AeroMACS and radio altimetry. It\nis also applicable to Ku/Ka-Band applications and various commercial cellular bands.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n103\n\n9.2 Delivery Manager\nThe DM provides the cohesion between the various specific links and the ultimate goal of all\ncommunication systems: the effective, timely and secure transfer of information. The DM\nfunction addresses link selection and prioritization, based on link availability, information\ntransfer needs, timeliness requirements, security and integrity considerations, cost\nconsiderations, Required Communication Performance (RCP), and many other factors. The DM\nfunction The DM function takes place both on the ground and onboard the aircraft, and has\nboth distributed and centrally managed elements. The existence of an effective DM function\nallows the seamless, coordinated use of both aviation-specific and commercial links, allows\naccess by a broad range of ground and air users while maintaining system security, and\nminimizes user costs by selecting the lowest cost suitable link for any given information\ntransaction and any given time.\n\n9.3 AeroWAN, AeroMACS, and Merged WiFi\nAeroWAN is a new link proposed as part of this research effort, and is technically based on the\nexisting AeroMACS concept and much of its underlying technology. AeroWAN is designed to\nfunction as an in-flight implementation of the AeroMACS concept, using L-Band aviation\nspectrum repurposed from DME and other previous aviation services. AeroMACS, conversely,\nis designed only for communication to and from aircraft when they are on the ground, and\nresides in repurposed 5 GHz aviation spectrum. Each in its own area of use offers the broadest\nand most flexible range of applications, highest bandwidth, and networking capabilities, and\ntogether serve as the \xe2\x80\x9cwork horse\xe2\x80\x9d communication resource of the future system.\nIf the AeroMACS and AeroWAN technologies, being so similar in underlying architecture and\ncomponents, could somehow be merged into a single system that served both air and ground\noperations with a single system, the advantages of the resulting system would be even more\ncompelling, This concept, called \xe2\x80\x9cMerged WiFi\xe2\x80\x9d was discussed in more detail in a previous\nreport.\n\n9.4 ADS-B Next\nThe re-architected ADS-B Next link offers significant advantages over the current ADS-B\nsystem. Advantages include higher initial bandwidth and improved performance, much more\nefficient bandwidth usage, significant expansion capability, and universal service to all aircraft\nwithout ground relays. Its applicability includes aircraft from large transports, to GA, to small\nUAS, and potential functions include air to air and air to ground communications for\nsurveillance, collision avoidance, wake turbulence and other environmental data, and spacebased ADS-B.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n104\n\n9.5 VDL-Next\nVDL-Next is similar to ADS-B Next in that is based on a re-architecture of the existing aviation\nVHF spectrum to allow much greater efficiency, bandwidth, and range of applications than\ncurrent VHF systems. VDL-Next is ranked below ADS-B Next primarily because its range of uses\nare primarily communication versus aircraft separation, and because those communication\nfunctions in the future could in many cases also be fulfilled by AeroWAN and AeroMACS.\nHowever, the propagation characteristics of VHF versus L-Band (or 5 GHz for AeroMACS) give it\nsome specific advantages for some communication applications, particularly for GA.\n\n9.6 Commercial Cellular Data Systems\nCommercial Cellular links offer an impressive range of capabilities today to mobile users, and\ncan only be expected to improve enormously over the 50 year research period. However, even\nwith the DM to address security and other robustness considerations, the business case for\ncommercial providers to make technical and commercial concessions to capture relatively\nlimited numbers of aviation users is unclear at best. As discussed previously, however, cellular\nsystems are already in limited use for air transport IFE applications, and offer a clearer path to\neven broader use in GA. Commercial cellular systems may also prove to be a vital link option\nwith small, low altitude UAS aircraft \xe2\x80\x93 potentially the largest aviation user segment by far by\n2064, subject to the business case caveats discussed in Section 8.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n105\n\n10 Conclusions and Recommendations\nThe research team has identified a combination aviation-specific and commercial links which\ncan provide a practical, cost-effective communication solution for the aviation needs circa\n2063. Harnessed and organized by a Delivery Manager function, such a combination will allow\nrobust, high speed connectivity in all phases of flight, at or above required levels of reliability,\nlatency, and integrity, at lowest practicable cost.\nPractical opportunities exist to make much more efficient use of aviation RF spectrum using\ntechnology that will be readily available long before 2063. Transitions from current to these\nfuture solutions can be made practical and cost-effective, with compelling business cases to\nstimulate equipage during the transition period. New and legacy systems can be made fully\ninteroperable throughout the transition phase.\nThis section summarizes the research team\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions in three groups: overall conclusions,\nspecific recommendations for the industry to consider in preparing for the future, and\nrecommendations for follow-on research to facilitate progress toward meeting the future\nindustry datalink needs.\n\n10.1 Overall Conclusions\nThis section summarizes eighteen conclusions reached by the research team during the course\nof the two-year research effort, which may offer insights into issues and considerations that\naffect the industry\xe2\x80\x99s progression from the current state of aviation data link to meeting its\nfuture needs:\n1) Current communication systems are not adequate to meet the needs of the 50-year\nfuture NAS;\n2) Current systems make very inefficient use of scarce aviation spectrum in the context of\ncurrent and future technical capabilities;\n3) Currently allocated aviation spectrum can serve nearly all future NAS CNS needs if used\neffectively;\n4) Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance are all interrelated in any study of future\ncommunication optimization;\n5) Viewing all RF-enabled systems as software functions on a BBSDR platform facilitates\noptimization, integration, simplification of avionics architectures, and reduced cost /\nsize / weight / power footprints;\n6) Future onboard navigation capabilities can be an important facilitator to bandwidth\noptimization;\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n106\n\n7) The proposed future architecture offers significant functional and cost advantages over\ncurrent systems;\n8) The proposed future architecture offers a workable transition path from current to\nfuture configuration;\n9) BBSDR technology is a key enabler of re-architecting existing aviation spectrum;\n10) DM-enabled \xe2\x80\x9ccloud communications\xe2\x80\x9d architecture offers a compelling combination of\nperformance, robustness, and cost;\n11) AeroWAN and AeroMACS could serve as the \xe2\x80\x9cworkhorse\xe2\x80\x9d of future systems;\no Aviation protected spectrum\no High bandwidth\no Broadcast and interactive\no Ground \xe2\x80\x93 Air \xe2\x80\x93 Ground\no Air \xe2\x80\x93 to \xe2\x80\x93 Air, including aircraft to aircraft message relay\no Suitable for C, N and S functions\n12) A \xe2\x80\x9cMerged WiFi\xe2\x80\x9d system would offer even greater advantages than AeroMACS and\nAeroWAN Separately;\n13) Expanded use of commercial communication links is feasible for aviation, but will\nrequire a DM-type manager to realize significant use outside of passenger\nentertainment applications;\n14) The security issues associated with use of cellular links for aviation applications should\nnot be underestimated;\n15) Cellular providers will need to realize sufficient revenue volume to justify system\nchanges and bandwidth diversion from their primary customer base;\n16) Cellular links may be best suited to passenger communications, use as backup links, and\nother non-critical information applications;\n17) GA and small UAS operations could be good potential applications of cellular links;\no Low altitude operations in particular\no Widespread coverage\no Usage-metered cost structure could be attractive to occasional users\no Security & lost-link management will be necessary\no Commercial provider cost/benefit considerations must be addressed\n18) UAS revenue volume could become the enabler for commercial service provider\ninterest in pursuing aviation markets.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n107\n\n10.2 Recommendations\nThe research team formulated six recommendations based on the research and its results,\nwhich could help guide the aviation industry toward a successful long-term communication\nstrategy:\nI.\n\nAn overall strategy for efficient use of aviation bandwidth should be developed,\nencompassing communications, navigation, and surveillance functions;\n\nII.\n\nSerious consideration should be given to a carefully planned, strategic realignment of\nRF spectrum currently allocated to aviation use for optimum benefit to the aviation\nindustry over the long term. Objectives should include:\no Efficiency of spectrum utilization;\no Mmultipurpose usage of bandwidth and avionics where practicable;\no Cost/benefit considerations for all aviation user segments, and\no The preservation of aviation spectrum against efforts to reassign portions of it\nto non-aviation usage;\n\nIII.\n\nFocused effort should be undertaken toward the development of a multi-purpose,\nground-air and air-air aviation communications network, residing in aviation protected\nRF spectrum, analogous to the AeroWAN concept proposed in this research;\n\nIV.\n\nThe aviation industry should explore the concept of implementing a privately funded,\ncommercial technology based multipurpose communications system residing within\nunused aviation spectrum;\n\nV.\n\nAdditional research should be conducted into options and development strategy for a\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerged WiFi\xe2\x80\x9d system combining the AeroMACS and AeroWAN concepts into a single\nsystem using a single LRU;\n\nVI.\n\nThe aviation industry should explore ways of accomplishing future oversight and\napprovals of communication capabilities on a functional performance assurance basis,\nrather than a link- and hardware-specific basis as is often the case today.\n\n10.3 Follow-On Research Recommendations\nThe scope of the research undertaken under this contract was necessarily limited, by program\ndefinition, and by available time and resources. A number of areas were identified in the\ncourse of the research that merit additional exploration. In particular, the following eight\nareas should be considered for follow-on research.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n108\n\nA. Propose, characterize and quantify benefits of specific methods and opportunities for\ngreatly improved efficiency in the use of existing aviation spectrum;\nB. Develop a holistic approach and strategy for future CNS in terms of RF spectrum\nutilization, particularly current aviation spectrum;\nC. Develop a conceptual transition path from current to future RF systems architecture,\nallowing seamless implementation of new systems while maintaining full operational\ncapability for existing systems over ample periods for industry equipage, infrastructure\ndeployment, and other factors;\nD. Examine interim points between current and 50-year architectures, and develop\n\xe2\x80\x9csnapshot\xe2\x80\x9d scenarios illustrating what is achievable in the nearer term;\nE. Develop detailed definition, requirements, and performance models for a multi-link\ncommunications system management function similar to the \xe2\x80\x9cDelivery Manager\xe2\x80\x9d\nfunction cited in this research. Include bot air and ground systems, functional\nconsiderations including communication and security aspects, and the capability to\nutilize both aviation-specific and commercial communication links. Develop a concept\ndesign to enable the safe, effective, and secure use of cloud communications for\naviation;\nF. Focused research is needed into the near- and long-term needs, and potential\nsolutions, for communications to, from, and between UAS operating at low altitudes;\nG. Develop detailed definition, requirements, and performance models for a potential\nground-air and air-air wireless utility network similar in concept to the AeroWAN\ntechnology proposed in this research; include potential merging of AeroWAN and\nAeroMACS functions into a single network;\nH. In-depth analysis of the requirements and options for the adaptation of terrestrial\ncellular communication systems to aviation applications, particularly GA and lowaltitude UAS, is needed; commercial provider business case considerations and\npotential motivators must be considered equally with technical aspects.\n\n10.4 Summary\nThe combination of overall architectures and specific link solutions proposed by this research\nconstitute a viable and effective solution to the future communication needs of the NAS in the\ntarget 50-year future. The research illustrates the significant potential service capabilities that\ncan be attained by more effective use of currently allocated aviation spectrum, and the\nadvantages of moving to a multi-purpose approach to link design and utilization in contrast to\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n109\n\nthe current paradigm. By combining optimized aviation links with commercial systems,\ncarefully managed by a Delivery Manager function, aviation can leverage true cloud\ncommunications to meet its needs 50 years, and much farther, into the future. By leveraging\nBBSDR technology as a multi-link, software modifiable platform, tremendous capabilities can\nbe provided to the future aircraft at a fraction of today\xe2\x80\x99s cost.\nThe research team maintained a conservative approach throughout the effort, and believes\nthat the concepts, capabilities, and costs proposed are not only feasible within the nominal 50year period, but are in fact possible in a shorter time, from a technical standpoint. The\ncontrolling factors to realizing what is technically practicable are primarily issues of planning,\nconsensus, regulatory adaptation, and initiative. Looking back at the progress of aviation over\nthe past 50 years suggests that the industry is certainly capable of achieving the degree of\nprogress that would be required. It is the XCELAR research team\xe2\x80\x99s hope that its presenting an\nexample of what the future can be will help stimulate progress toward a reality that far\neclipses the proposals in this report.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n110\n\n11 Appendices\n\nThis page Intentionally left blank\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n111\n\n11.1 Future Datalink Technology Candidate Matrix\nTable 11-1: Airborne Aircraft, Inbound Communications\n1A (1 of 2)\nFunction\nCode\n\nFunction Type\n\nA/C type(U, G, A, Information Use\nH)\n\nContent\n(examples)\n\nUpdate\nRate\n\nRange\n\nFrom: Priority:\nAck/Nac\nAir (A), Must (1), Origin\nFile Best Datalink Candidates and\nor\nLatency\nGround HD (2), of data\nSize\nMerit Scores (1-10)\nBroadcast\n(G)\nNice (3)\n\nOther proximate\nvehicle status /\nInfo\n\nOther\naircraft\n\nLocation / State\nVector / Intentions\n\nG, A, U\n\nFlight path\ndeconfliction,\ncollision avoidance,\nwake vortex\navoidance\n\nOther vehicle\ninformation\n\nG, A, U\n\nOther vehicle\ninformation\n\n80 miles\n\nB\n\nA\n\n1\n\nOther\naircraft\n\n<1 sec 112 b\n\n9- ADS-B Next\n9- AeroWAN\n7- ADS-B\n5- UAT\n\nVehicle\nGeneral information type/size/major\ncharacteristics\n\nEvery 30 sec 80 miles\n\nB\n\nA\n\n2\n\nOther\naircraft\n\n5 sec\n\n112 b\n\n9- ADS-B Next\n9- AeroWAN\n7- ADS-B\n5- UAT\n\nG, A, U\n\nVehicle information\nnecessary to predict\nthe intensity,\ntransport, and decay\nof wake vorticies\n\nEvery 30 sec 80 miles\n\nB\n\nA\n\n2\n\nOther\naircraft\n\n5 sec\n\n112 b\n\n9- ADS-B Next\n9- AeroWAN\n7- ADS-B\n5- UAT\n\nAtmospherics (e.g.\nTurbulence)\n\nG, A, U\n\nHazard avoidance,\nwake vortex\navoidance, weather\nforecasting\n\nEvery 10 sec 20 miles\n\nB\n\nA\n\n2\n\nOther\naircraft\n\n5 sec\n\n2 Kb\n\n9- ADS-B Next\n8- UAT FIS-B with Revisions\n8- AeroWAN\n\nAtmospherics (e.g.\nTurbulence)\n\nG, A, U\n\nEvery 60 sec 80 miles\n\nB\n\nA\n\n2\n\nOther\naircraft\n\n5 sec\n\n2 Kb\n\n9- ADS-B Next\n8- UAT FIS-B with Revisions\n8- AeroWAN\n\nAtmospherics (e.g.\nTurbulence)\n\nG, A, U\n\nAs needed\n\n80 miles\n\nB\n\nA\n\n2\n\nOther\naircraft\n\n1 sec\n\n112\nbit\n\n9- ADS-B Next\n8- UAT FIS-B with Revisions\n8- AeroWAN\n\nAs needed\n\nRegional\n\nAck\n\nG\n\n1\n\nATM\n\n2 min\n\n9- AeroWAN\n10KB 7- VDL-2 Next\n5- UAT\n\nB\n\nG\n\n2\n\nATM\n\n2 min\n\n<10K 7- SDARS\nB\n6- VDL-2 Next Broadcast\n\nAAI-1\n\nAAI-2\n\nAAI-3\n\nAAI-4\n\nAAI-5\n\nAAI-6\nEnroute\n\nG, A\n\nDestination\n\nGross weight,\ninitial vortex\ncirulation, flap\nsetting\n\nAMDAR reports\n(terminal), wind\nspeed and\ndirection, Eddy\nDissipation Rate\n(EDR),\ntemperature,\nhumidity level\nAMDAR reports\nFlight management (Enroute), wind\nof ride quality,\nspeed and\nhazard avoidance,\ndirection, Eddy\nwake vortex\nDissipation Rate\navoidance, weather (EDR),\nforecasting\ntemperature,\nhumidity level\nAvoidance of\nimmediate weather EDR, icing\nhazards (i. e.\ninformation,\nmoderate or greater volcanic ash\nturbulence, icing,\nconcentration\nvolcanic ash)\nTraffic flow\nArrival slot times,\nmanagement to\narrival capacity\nallow for flight and versus demand,\nsystemic\nflow constrained\noptimization\nareas\n\nG, A\n\nAAI-7\n\nPresent position,\nvelocity vector,\nFlight ID, Aircraft\ncategory\n\n6/sec\n\n9- AeroWAN\nDelay probability,\nNOTAMS, ATIS\n\nEvery 5 min Regional\n\nAAI-8\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n5- UAT FIS-B\n\n112\n\nTable 11-2: Airborne Aircraft, Inbound Communications (Cont\xe2\x80\x99d)\n1A (2 of 2)\nFunction\nCode\n\nFunction Type\n\nA/C typeInformation Use\n(G, A, U)\n\nContent\n(examples)\n\nUpdate\nRate\n\nRange\n\nFrom: Priority:\nAck/Nac\nAir (A), Must (1), Origin\nFile Best Datalink Candidates and\nor\nLatency\nGround HD (2), of data\nSize\nMerit Scores (1-10)\nBroadcast\n(G)\nNice (3)\n\nAtmospherics\n\nAtmospherics\n\nG\n\nAAI-9\n\nAtmospherics\n\nA\n\nAAI-10\n\nFlight crew\nsituational\nawareness\ninformation\nregarding weather\nalong their flight\npath\nFlight crew\nsituational\nawareness\ninformation\nregarding weather\nalong their flight\npath\n\nGraphical or 4-D\nMatrix Wx for\nmanned aircraft\n(pilot/crew use)\n\nEvery 60 sec 500 miles\n\nGraphical or 4-D\nMatrix Wx for\nmanned aircraft\n(pilot/crew use)\n\nEvery 5 min\n\n1,000\nmiles\n\nB\n\nB\n\nG\n\nG\n\n2\n\n2\n\nGround\nnonATM\n\n2 min\n\nGround\nnonATM\n\n2 min\n\nEvery 30\nmin\n\nGlobal\n\nB\n\nG\n\n2\n\nGround\nnonATM\n\nAtmospherics\n\nA\n\nTextual Wx for flight\nWind, temp, EDR\nmanagement use\n\nAtmospherics\n\nG\n\nTextual Wx for flight\nWind, temp, EDR\nmanagement use\n\nEvery 30\nmin\n\n500 miles\n\nB\n\nG\n\n2\n\nGround\nnonATM\n\nAtmospherics\n\nU\n\nNumerical Wx for\nflight management\nuse\n\nWind, temp, EDR\n\nEvery 30\nmin\n\nvariable\n\nB\n\nG\n\n3\n\nGround\nnonATM\n\nSeparation &\noptimization\n\nRouting, RTA,\nhazards\n\nAAI-11\n\nAAI-12\n\nAAI-13\nATM guidance &\nRelevant\nInformation\n\nA, G, U\n\nAs required Regional\n\n9- AeroWAN\n8 -

This is\nparticularly true for AeroWAN and AeroMACS, whose mobile network capabilities are\ncompatible with many different tasks. VDL-2 Next and Cellular also feature applicability to a\nvariety of functions. The average scores (Fig. 2) show a different perspective, with systems\noptimized for a specific type of function, and only scored for those functions, ranking higher\nthan their aggregate scores. ADS-B Next has the highest score, essentially because it is\nintended to do one very important type of job, and does it well.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n133\n\nAverage Link Score - Baseline\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\n6.0\n\n7.0\n\n8.0\n\n9.0\n\n10.0\n\nADS-B Next\nADS-B/ Lo Pwr\nAeroMACS\nAeroWAN\nUAT\nVDL-2 Next\nVDL-2\nSDARS\nCellular\nIridium/Next\nKa Bcast\nKa Inter\nAverage Link Score\n\nFigure 11-2: Average Link Scores - Baseline\n11.6.2 Function Priority Weighted Analysis Results\nEach future NAS function was identified early in this research effort, and its datalink-related\ncharacteristics defined. One parameter defined for each function is its relative priority,\ndefined in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cMust Have, Highly Desirable, or Nice-to-Have\xe2\x80\x9d. These priorities were used\nin the next analysis step, to establish weighting factors for each candidate link based on the\npriority of each function that it serves. A 5-point scale was used, with weightings of 1, 3 and 5\nrespectively for each increasing level of priority. This helps to differentiate those candidates\nwhich potentially contribute the most to the conduct of flight. Fig. 3 shows the aggregated\nscores, which also illustrate broadest range of functions served, and shows that AeroMACS and\nAeroWAN not only serve a range of functions, but of high priority functions as well.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n134\n\nFunction Priority Weighted Aggregate Score\n0.0\n\n100.0\n\n200.0\n\n300.0\n\n400.0\n\nADS-B Next\nADS-B/ Lo Pwr\nAeroMACS\nAeroWAN\nUAT\nVDL-2 Next\nVDL-2\nSDARS\nCellular\nIridium/Next\nKa Bcast\nKa Inter\nTotal Link Score\n\nFigure 11-3: Function Priority Weighted Aggregate Scores\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n135\n\n500.0\n\n600.0\n\n700.0\n\nFunction Priority Weighted Average Score\n0.0\n\n5.0\n\n10.0\n\n15.0\n\n20.0\n\n25.0\n\n30.0\n\n35.0\n\nADS-B Next\nADS-B/ Lo Pwr\nAeroMACS\nAeroWAN\nUAT\nVDL-2 Next\nVDL-2\nSDARS\nCellular\nIridium/Next\nKa Bcast\nKa Inter\nAverage Link Score\n\nFigure 11-4: Function Priority Weighted Average Scores\nFig. 4 considers the function priority in the context only of each candidate\xe2\x80\x99s level of service to\nthose functions it enables. Results are similar to the Baseline average in that ADS-B Next still\nscores well, as a system focused on a specific and important job. AeroMACS also scores well,\nin part because of its potential application as an alternative to ADS-B Next for ground\noperations.\n11.6.3 Weighted Scores with Obsolescence\nAdding the consideration of potential obsolescence to the preceding analysis steps required\ndeveloping ratings for each candidate link\xe2\x80\x99s susceptibility or resistance to obsolescence going\nforward from the 50-year future reference time point. It should be noted that this area of\nconsideration has both technical and business case elements; this report is focused on the\ntechnical aspects of candidate comparison, with business case analysis to follow in the next\nphase of this research. Accordingly, the team approached the analysis of potential\nobsolescence as a transition point, with primary focus on technical considerations but\nincluding some preliminary assessment of related business factors as well. A number of factors\nwere applied by the team to assign obsolescence ratings, using a scale of 1 (most susceptible)\nto 5 (least susceptible), including:\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n136\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAdaptability to Evolving Technology\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAdaptability to Future Functions\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nBandwidth Expansion Capability\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAcquisition and Operation Cost Trends\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nPotential Trends in Underlying Business Model (commercial candidates)\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nUncertainty of Long-Term Stability (technical or business model)\n\nRatings assigned were:\nADS-B Next\n\n5\n\nADS-B\n\n2\n\nAeroMACS\n\n4\n\nAeroWAN\n\n5\n\nUAT\n\n2\n\nVDL-2 Next\n\n4\n\nVDL-2\n\n1\n\nSDARS\n\n3\n\nCellular\n\n4\n\nIridium\n\n4\n\nKa-Band Broadcast\n\n5\n\nKa-Band Interactive\n\n5\n\nAs discussed previously in Section 4.8, the application of SDR technology to the overall\narchitecture of the future system enhances the resistance of all candidate links to potential\nobsolescence, but to varying degrees in some cases. Current links such as VDL-2 and ADS-B\nwere evaluated without any benefit of SDR technology; the future versions proposed in this\nresearch (e.g., ADS-B Next, VDL-2 Next) are in part defined by that specific difference.\nConversely, the AeroWAN concept is an entirely new link, with SDR and DM as integral\nelements of its architecture, and can be expected to derive maximum benefit from those\ntechnologies as a result. Other candidates fall in between.\nIn general, the SDR architecture for any given avionics unit applies to a group of contiguous\nfrequencies, such as the entire L-Band, but not to more disparate frequency ranges such as LBand (nominally 1 GHz) versus the 5 GHz range where AeroMACS currently resides. For this\nreason AeroMACS is rated slightly lower than AeroWAN due to its location in the former MLS\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n137\n\nband, where there is a limited scope of other aviation services or link types within SDR range,\nwhereas AeroWAN resides in the L-Band along with many other aviation-related services. Thus\nan L-Band SDR could potentially be adapted and used for many more future functions than an\nSDR designed for AeroMACS.\nIt is anticipated that bandwidth demand will continue to escalate beyond the 50-year\nreference point, and links whose capability to adapt as needed in order to access additional\nbandwidth will be more susceptible to obsolescence. Current VDL-2 is limited by its available\nbandwidth and channel structure, and its modulation, and offers limited resistance to future\nobsolescence in its current form. With the implementation of SDR and DM technology in the\nfuture, VDL (or other VHF band avionics) will allow restructuring of many of those limiting\nfactors, greatly increasing capabilities and allowing various future enhancements and\nfunctions. Since this is the underlying premise of the VDL-2 Next candidate proposed as part of\nthis research versus current VDL-2, VDL-2 Next is scored much higher in its resistance to\nobsolescence. However, as a VHF system, with its growth presumably limited to the scope of\nthe currently defined VHF aviation band, its potential for growth is more limited than some\nother candidates and was scored at less than maximum rating as a result.\nThe same rationale applies to current ADS-B relative to the ADS-B Next candidate proposed as\npart of the current research. Current ADS-B\xe2\x80\x99s inherent purpose-built hardware and singlechannel spectral structure place firm constraints on both its bandwidth expansion and\nadaptability to future architectures. In contrast, ADS-B Next has inherent SDR architecture and\naccess to additional spectrum for future growth, and a straightforward path to implementing\nenhancements on a configuration-based or software-only basis using the same hardware.\nUAT has similar limits to those of current ADS-B, with single-purpose hardware and a single,\nfirmly defined bandwidth for current and future needs. The research team opted not to\npropose a \xe2\x80\x9cUAT-Next\xe2\x80\x9d candidate; the proposed ADS-B Next system has ample bandwidth and\nexpansion capacity to accommodate all potential ADS-B user segments, without the need for\nsegregated solutions for different types of users. Merging the General Aviation and lowaltitude users into the overall ADS-B community increases interoperability, standardization,\nproduction volumes, and efficiency of bandwidth use, while simplifying system architecture\nand removing the need for an external infrastructure to relay ADS-B data between the\ndifferent systems. As a result, UAT was scored lower than ADS-B Next in Obsolescence\nsusceptibility.\nSDARS is a commercial system designed for a very different purpose, and capitalized by a very\ndifferent core subscriber base, than its current aviation users. This \xe2\x80\x9cpiggyback\xe2\x80\x9d model for\nserving aviation is more difficult to predict going forward, particularly over long periods of\ntime. If the market dynamics of the much larger core use base change, niche users such as\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n138\n\naviation have little control over the future of the link, be it technically or financially. As a\nresult, SDARS was assigned a lower rating than some candidates based in part on this\nuncertainty. In addition, its commercial architecture allocates limited bandwidth to special\napplications such as aviation. If the current commercial business model does remain stable,\nthere is a likelihood that limited additional bandwidth will be allocated away from other\ncompeting user functions to aviation. In that event its ability to keep pace with anticipated\nincreasing aviation bandwidth needs becomes a form of obsolescence in itself.\nIn general, it is anticipated that cellular systems will continue to thrive and progress for the\nforeseeable future, both technically and commercially. What is less certain is the evolution of\nthe commercial business model in relation to the relatively small aviation user base. The\naviation base is expected to grow over time, but whether it will grow in relation to the groundbased revenue segments competing for bandwidth and capital for infrastructure adaptations is\nmuch less clear. As discussed previously, this report is focused on technical considerations,\nwith business case aspects the subject of the next phase of research, and obsolescence is an\narea that relates to both areas. For the purpose of this report, cellular candidates were given a\nrelatively high score on technical grounds, but reduced by one point based on the\nuncertainties of bandwidth access and other expansion and adaptation prospects.\nThe obsolescence prospects of Iridium and similar future systems was based on the\nassumption the that planned Iridium/Next system will be fully implemented as planned over\nthe next 10 years, including the planned space-based ADS-B capability. Although Iridium is\nfundamentally a commercial system being used in part by aviation applications, the advent of\nspace-based ADS-B increases the likelihood of long-term access to bandwidth and adaptation\nby aviation users. Conversely, the prospects for allocation of significant additional spectrum to\nsuch services are questionable based on the current climate, which could limit this candidate\xe2\x80\x99s\nlong-term bandwidth growth access. For these reasons a relatively high rating was assigned,\nbut not the highest possible rating.\nBoth Ka-band systems (broadcast and interactive) were considered primarily in the context of\nservices to larger aircraft in oceanic regions, where they offer the strongest benefits. Due to\nconsiderations of antenna size limitations on smaller aircraft, and weather induced signal\nattenuation at low altitudes, their obsolescence potential was based primarily on air transport\napplications. In this user segment Ka-band candidates were deemed to have strong long-term\npotential for availability, as well as potential bandwidth growth through both spectrum access\nand various technical enhancements. With these caveats, both were assigned high ratings. It\nshould be noted that satellite systems will also benefit from the application of SDR technology,\nand those requiring steerable antennas can be expected to benefit less SDR than other\ncandidates.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n139\n\nFig. 5 shows the aggregate scores for all candidates with obsolescence taken into account. This\nmay provide the clearest \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment case\xe2\x80\x9d perspective of which candidates merit the most\ninvestment in research and development to realize the maximum future benefit. It can be\nseen that the highest ranking candidates, in order, are AeroWAN, VDL-2 Next, and ADS-B Next.\nADS-B Next and AeroMACS have nearly identical rankings; AeroMACS is already the subject of\nsignificant research, the merit of which is reinforced by this analysis.\n\nAggregate Weighted Score with Obsolescence\n0.0\n\n500.0\n\n1000.0\n\n1500.0\n\n2000.0\n\n2500.0\n\n3000.0\n\n3500.0\n\nADS-B Next\nADS-B/ Lo Pwr\nAeroMACS\nAeroWAN\nUAT\nVDL-2 Next\nVDL-2\nSDARS\nCellular\nIridium/Next\nKa Bcast\nKa Inter\nTotal Link Score\n\nFigure 11-5: Aggregate Weighted Score with Obsolescence\nThe average scores with obsolescence considered, shown below in Fig. 6, show a somewhat\ndifferent order of the same four top candidates, with ADS-B Next scoring highest in is\nperformance within its more limited areas of application, followed by AeroMACS, AeroWAN,\nand VDL-2 Next. Note that both cellular and interactive Ka-band also score well.\nADS-B Next, AeroMACS, and interactive Ka-Band all score well in part because they are\npurposely designed to address specific needs in specific areas rather than broad-based links for\nmany applications. AeroMACS only serves ground-based users in close proximity to airports,\nKa-Band serves large aircraft at cruise altitudes in oceanic areas, and ADS-B Next is purposely\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n140\n\nlimited to proximate aircraft awareness functions. Cellular candidates also score well for\nsimilar reasons, being primarily applicable to ground-based uses not unlike AeroMACS.\n\nAverage Weighted Score with\nObsolescence\n0.0\n\n20.0\n\n40.0\n\n60.0\n\n80.0\n\n100.0\n\n120.0\n\n140.0\n\n160.0\n\nADS-B Next\nADS-B/ Lo Pwr\nAeroMACS\nAeroWAN\nUAT\nVDL-2 Next\nVDL-2\nSDARS\nCellular\nIridium/Next\nKa Bcast\nKa Inter\nAverage Link Score\n\nFigure 11-6: Average Weighted Score with Obsolescence\n11.6.4 Merged AeroWAN and AeroMACS Rankings\nOne special case was also analyzed by the team. AeroWAN and AeroMACS, as currently\ndefined, are based on similar technology and operate in similar ways, but serve two disparate\noperational contexts using two relatively divergent frequency bands. As a result, each scores\nvery well in its own area: AeroWAN in airborne functions only, and AeroMACS in ground\nfunctions only. If these two systems could be merged over the 50 year research period, a\nnumber of advantages would be gained, including commonality of both ground and airborne\nequipment, potentially one less avionics device needed, and increased coverage by using\nairport systems to also serve as AeroWAN ground stations and vice versa.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n141\n\nThe team opted to model a merged system in the AeroWAN L-Band spectrum primarily due to\nthe broader applications of an L-Band SDR; however, more detailed technical analysis would be\nneeded to formulate a considered recommendation. The aggregate scores under this scenario\nare shown in Fig. 7 below. It can be seen that the \xe2\x80\x9cMerged WiFi\xe2\x80\x9d system outscores all other\ncandidates by a significant margin, due to its broad-based range of functions served coupled\nwith its high bandwidth and other strong performance rankings. This suggests that, of all the\ncandidates analyzed, such a merged AeroWAN/AeroMACS system would serve the most users\nand functions, across all user segments, of any single link studied.\n\nAggregate Weighted Score - Merged WiFi\n0.0\n\n1000.0\n\n2000.0\n\n3000.0\n\n4000.0\n\n5000.0\n\n6000.0\n\n7000.0\n\nADS-B Next\nADS-B/ Lo Pwr\nAeroMACS\nAeroWAN\nUAT\nVDL-2 Next\nVDL-2\nSDARS\nCellular\nIridium/Next\nKa Bcast\nKa Inter\nTotal Link Score\n\nFigure 11-7: Aggregate Weighted Scoring Showing Merged AeroWAN / AeroMACS Score\n11.6.5 Aggregate versus Average Rankings\nThe Gap Analysis input downselect step identified the top three or more candidates for each\nfunction; in each case there were at least 2 candidates with scores of 7 or higher. This\nindicates that suitable performance can be obtained for each function from two or more\ncandidates. As a result, while the Average rankings provide an interesting look at optimum\noptions, which may be useful in choosing between two qualified candidates, in general the\nteam concluded that the Aggregate Rankings provide a more compelling measure of overall\ncandidate merit, particularly in the context of defining development priorities going forward.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n142\n\nA link candidate that provides suitable service for many functions may well support a better\nbusiness case for development investment than one that provides somewhat better service for\na small number of functions. Using the Aggregate Weighted Score with Obsolescence analysis\nresults, as shown in Fig. 5, the highest-ranking candidates are AeroWAN, VDL-2 Next, ADS-B\nNext, and AeroMACS.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n143\n\n11.7 Appendix 7 \xe2\x80\x93 SDR and DM Conceptual Architecture\n\nFigure 11-8: Conceptual Architecture of Delivery Manager and BBSDR in Aircraft Systems\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n144\n\nFigure 11-9: Conceptual Architecture of Delivery Manager and BBSDR in Aircraft Systems\n(Cont.)\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n145\n\n11.8 Appendix 8 \xe2\x80\x93 Acronyms and Terms\nTable 11-14: Acronyms and Terms\n4G LTE\nAAC\nAAI\nAAO\nACARS\nACK/NAC\nA/D\nADS-B\nAeroMACS\nAeroWAN\nAGATE\nAGI\nAGO\nALOHA\nAM\nAMDAR\nANSP\nAOC\nATC\nATIS\nATM\nBBSDR\nCMU\nCO-I\nCPDLC\nDBA\nDM\nDME\nDMU\nDSP\nFAMS\nFCC\nFEC\nFIS-B\nFOQA\nGA\nGEO\nGHz\nGLS\n\nFourth Generation, Long-Term Evolution\nAirline Administrative Communications\nAircraft Airborne, Inbound communications\nAircraft Airborne, Outbound communications\nAircraft Communications Addressing and\nReporting System\nAcknowledge / No Acknowledgement\nAnalog to Digital\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance \xe2\x80\x93 Broadcast\nAeronautical Mobile Airport Communication System\nAeronautical Wide Area Network\nAdvanced General Aviation Transport Experiment\nAircraft on Ground, Inbound communications\nAircraft on Ground, Outbound communications\nProtocol: precursor to Ethernet\nAmplitude Modulation\nAircraft Meteorological DAta Relay\nAir Navigation Service Provider\nAirline Operational Communications\nAir Traffic Control\nAutomatic Terminal Information Service\nAir Traffic Management\nBroad Band Software Defined Radio\nCommunication Management Unit\nCo-Investigator\nController Pilot Data Link Communications\nDoing Business As\nDelivery Manager\nDistance Measuring Equipment\nData Management Unit\nDigital Signal Processor\nFederal Air Marshall Service\nFederal Communication Commission\nForward Error Correction\nFlight Information Services - Broadcast\nFlight Operations Quality Assurance\nGeneral Aviation\nGeosynchronous Satellite\nGigaHertz\nGNSS Landing System\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n146\n\nGNSS\nGPS\nHPA\nICNS\nIFE\nIFR\nILS\nIP\nKa-band\nKm\nKOM\nKu-Band\nLAAS\nLEO\nLRU\nMLS\nMON\nMSK\nMTBF\nMTTR\nNAS\nNIA\nNOTAM\nOPD\nPI\nPTM\nPTT\nQAM\nQPSK\nRA\nRCP\nRF\nRX\nSATCOM\nSATS\nSDARS\nSDR\nSME\nSquitter\nSSID\nSUAS, sUAS\nSWAT\nTACAN\nTCAS\nTDMA\nTOC\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System\nGlobal Positioning System, a U.S. operated GNSS\nHigh Power Amplifier\nInternational Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance conference\nIn Flight Entertainment\nInstrument Flight Rules\nInstrument Landing System\nInternet Protocol\n26.5\xe2\x80\x9340 GHz\nKilometers\nKick-Off Meeting\n12-18 GHz\nLocal Area Augmentation System\nLow Earth Orbit\nLine Replaceable Unit\nMicrowave Landing System\nMinimum Operating Network\nMinimum Shift Keying\nMean Time Between Failures\nMean Time To repair\nNational Airspace System\nNational Institute of Aerospace\nNOtice To AirMen\nOptimum Profile Descent\nPrinciple Investigator\nPair-wise Trajectory Management\nPush-To-Talk\nQuadrature Amplitude Modulation\nQuadrature Phase Shift Keying\nRadio Altimeter\nRequired Communication Performance\nRadio Frequency\nReceiver\nSatellite Communication\nSmall Aircraft Transportation System\nSatellite Digital Audio Radio Systems\nSoftware Defined Radio\nSubject Matter Expert\nTransponder Message Transmission\nService Set IDentifier\nSmall Unmanned Aircraft System\nSpecial Weapons And Tactics team\nTACtical Air Navigation\nTraffic alert and Collision Avoidance System\nTime Division Multiple Access\nTop Of Climb\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n147\n\nTSA\nTX\nUAS\nUAT\nUPR\nVDL- Mode 2\nVFR\nVHF\nVLJ\nWAN\nWi-Fi\n\nTransportation Security Administration\nTransmitter\nUnmanned Aerial System\n(ADS-B) Universal Access Transceiver\nUser Preferred Routing\nVHF Data Link \xe2\x80\x93 Mode 2\nVisual Flight Rules\nVery High Frequency\nVery Light Jet\nWide Area Network\nWireless Network Technology\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942015-218843\n\n148\n\n'
