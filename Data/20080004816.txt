The present\ninvention relates to labyrinth seal systems with selected\nsealing surfaces and seal geometry to optimize flow deflection and produce maximum turbulent action. Optimum seal\nperformance is generally accomplishedby providing sealing\nsurfaces and fluid cavities formed to dissipate fluid energy as\na function of the geometry of the sealing surfaces along with\nthe position and size of the fluid cavities formed between\nmembers of the labyrinth seal system. Improved convex\nlw\nsurfaces, annular flow reversal grooves. f o deflection\nblocks and rough. machined surfaces cooperate to enhance\nthe performance of the labyrinth seal systems. For some\nlabyrinth seal systems a mid-cavity throttle and either rigid\nteeth or flexible spring teeth may be included.\n35 Claims, 7 Draw& Sheets\n\n20\n\n22\n\nJ\n\n5.639.095\nPage 2\nU.S. PM\'ENT DOCUMENTS\n3,594.010 7/1971 War& ........................................\n3.630329 1211971 Ball ...........................................\n3.701536 10/1972 Matthews et al\n3.865304 2/1975 Benz .......................................\n3.897. 169 7/1975 Fowler ....................................\n3.940. 153 2/1976 Stocker .....................................\n4.042248 8/1977 W l i m t s\nilaii\n\n.........................\n\n...............\n\n277153\n277f22\n277/56\n415/113\n415/172\n277/57\n277/138\n\n...........\n...........\n................................\n\n4,273,510 W1981 Ambmsch et al\n4.335. 886 W1982 Frey et al\n4,338.080 711982 Grandcolas et al\n4.398. 725 8/1983 Maegawa\n4.405. 137 9/1983 Webb\n4.433. 848 2f1984 Williams .................................\n4,500.098 2/1985 Wdcox et al\n4. 961588 10/1990 Brienza ...................................\n5.100. 158 3/1W Gardner\n\n.................................\n\n......................................\n...........................\n....................................\n\n415/119\n277r25\n432/115\n2771192\n2771153\n2771199\n277/170\n2771148\n277/53\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nJun. 17,1997\n\n5,639,095\n\nSheet 1 of 7\n\nFIG.

Labyrinth seal system manufactured in accordance with the present invention may be\nused with new equipment and refurbished equipment. Such\nlabyrinth seal systems wiU allow increased operating performance from both new equipment and refurbished equip\nment.\nThe present invention provides improved sealing systems\nwith the geometry of the sealing surfaces designed to\noptimize fluid flow deflection and to produce maximum\nturbulent action to dissipate fluid energy. High velocity,\nsharply curved, free shear layers and multiple cavities are\ncombined to improve seal performances. As a result of this\ninvention. turbulence generation and thus thermal dissipation of fluid enexgy are enhanced across the length of the\nlabyrinth seal system resulting in improved seal performance.\nThe present invention was developed as a result of\nextensive design optimization studies of fluid leakage characteristics in numerous labyrinth seal system. An advanced\nfinite dilference computer program as well as a test rig were\nused to solve the governing fluid flow equations containing\nknown fluid flow physical phenomena with state-of-the-art\ncomputer modeling. By varying selected design variables\nfor each computer solution. an optimum design for these\nvariables was found over a desired operating range for the\nequipment containing the associated labyrinth seal. Offen\nthe optimum design resulted from an important trade-off\nbetween opposing energy dissipating mechanisms.\nThe present invention dissipates fluid energy and thus\nrestricts fluid flow through a labyrinth seal system by a\ncombination of convex surfaces. fluid cavities, annular flow\nreversal grooves, rough surface finishes on selected portions\nof the fluid cavities and flexible knives or spring teeth as\nappropriate. The optimum seal is created by employing\nspecific geometric relationships derived from solutions\n\nobtained through the use of applicable computer models and\nexperimental test rigs.\n~n m m n t t e c h i d advantage ofthe present invention\nincludes novel configurations for projections from the rotor\nand/or stator into the fluid flow path between the rotor and\n~\nstator. The projections employed in the present invention use\nthe net force on a fluid particle, involving turbulence generation and heat dissipation, to turn through-flow fluid and\nthereby increase the labyrinth seal system\xe2\x80\x99s resistance to\nsuch fluid flow. The projections include concave. convex\nand flat surfaceswhich maximize flow turbulence. For some\napplications, seal performance may be enhanced by placing\na mid-cavity orifice or throttle in selected fluid cavities.\nExamples of a mid-cavity orifice or throttle satisfactory for\nuse with the present invention include a radial projection and\nan associated convex surface or a plwality of flexible spring\nteeth disposed within the selected fluid cavities.\nThe present invention results in seal surfaces and cornponents which may be easily machined and are resistant to\ndamage from shaft vibrations which may result in mbbing\nbetween rotating and stationary members of the labyrinth\nseal system nepresent invention also minimizes any\nvibration which may result from eccentricities in a rotating\nshaft relative to its housing and/or undesired circumferential\nfluid flow around the exterior of the rotating shaft.\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a radially\nstepped labyrinth seal is formed between a rotor and a stator.\nThe seal itself involves a rotary shaft having a rotor with a\nplurality of axially spaced. angularly stepped portions with\n30\nhigh pressure sides and low pressure sides, and a stationary\nhousing having a stator surrounding the shaft, and having\ncorresponding second annular stepped portions on its inner\nperiphery. The combination of the rotor and stator define a\n35 restricted fluid flow path therebetween. In a general embodiment of the invention, the height S of a projection is defined\nby a function of the minimum clearance C,between edges\nof the projection and the adjacent portion of a convex\nsurface.\nIn a specific embodiment of the present invention, aradial\n4o\nprojection is formed in the wall of the stator and is located\nsubstantially opposite a convex surface on the low pressure\nside of a radial projection from the rotor. An alternative\nembodiment of the present invention includes a radial pro45 jection formed in the rotor and located substantially opposite\nfrom a convex surface on the low-pressure side of a radial\nprojection from the stator. The convex surface in both\nembodiments is provided to guide or direct fluid flow into a\nrecessed portion of the fluid cavity adjacent to the respective\n5o convex surface. Minimum clearance C is provided between\neach radial projection and its associated convex surface to\nfurther assist in directing fluid flow into the asscrciated\nrecessed cavity.\nA further embodiment of the present invention includes\n55 providing semi-ellipticalannular grooves in various surfaces\nassociated with the stator andor the rotor. The semielliptical grooves are oriented in opposition to the direction\nof fluid flow through the labyrinth seal system. The semielliptical grooves may be formed in radial projections from\n60 the stator andorrotor orin other surfaces associated with the\nfluid cavities.\nAn importanttechnical advantage of the present invention\nincludes providing flexible knives or spring teeth to establish\nf\na fluid barrier within selected portions o the labyrinth seal\n65 system. The spring teeth may include end fittings which\nfurther restrict fluid flow through the labyrinth seal system.\nIf desired, the end fittings on the spring teeth may provide\n\n5,639.095\n5\n\n6\n\na fluid trap to increase the local pressure to lift the spring\nF G 6b is a drawing in longitudinal section with portions\nI.\nteeth tips radially outward only about 0.001 inches from the\nbroken showing flexible knives or spring teeth disposed\nadjacent surface to achieve an extremely small clearance.\nwithin a fluid cavity between a stator and a rotor incorpoThe spring teeth and their associated end fittings are prefrating another embodiment of the present invention;\nerablY designed wear Only\nduring the &st few 5\nFIG. & is a &awing taken along lines 6\n~ of FIG. 66~\n4\nhours Of Owrating the quipment associated with the labyshowing the end fitting on one of the flexible hives or\nrinth seal system This concept allows the minimum required\nspring teeth of FIG.6b;\nclearance between rotating and stationary components of the\nF G 7 is an isometric drawing in elevation with portions\nI.\nseal system.\nbroken\nshowing the flexible knives or spring teeth of\nAn additional technical advantage ofthe present invention\nincludes providing spoilers or boundary layer breakers on lo FIG Q;\nradial projections and other selected surfaces of the fluid\nFIG.8a is a schematic drawing showing an alternative\nih\ncavities to increase turbulent intensity within the labyrinth\nembodiment of an end fitting used wt the flexible knives\nor spring teeth of FIG.6a;\nseal system.

Also, a plurality of second slots 68 are\npreferably formed between each tooth in the second set of\nspring teeth 64.Slots 66 and 68 cooperate with each other\nto provide the desired flexibilityof spring teeth assembly 60 15\n4\no\nwithin the associated rotor 2 and stator 22. F r some\napplications only one or two slots 66 andor 68 may be\nrequired. In other applications. slots 66 and 68 may not be\nrequired.\nThe first set of spring teeth 62are oriented with respect to\nthe second set of spring teeth 64 such that each tooth 62will\nblock one second slot 68. In a similar manner. the second set\nof spring teeth 64 are oriented such that each tooth 64 will\nblock fluid flow through first slot 66. This preferred align- 25\nment of spring teeth 62 and 64 results in fluid flow being\ndirected between free end 70 of spring teeth assembly 60 and\nthe adjacent surface 46 of rotor 24.\nAs shown in FIGS. 6a.6b.8a and 86, various types of end\nfittings may be secured to free ends 70 of spring teeth\nassembly 60. End fittings 72. 7 . 76 and 78 are preferably 30\n4\nformed f o material which is softer than adjacent surface\nrm\n46 of rotor 2 .Spring teeth 62 and 64 are generally formed\n4\nfrom relatively hard material. If spring teeth 62 or 64\ndirectly contact surface 46.they may possibly cause damage\nto rotor 24 and/or spring teeth assembly 60.BY properly 35\nselecting the material for fabrication of end fittings 72.74.\n76 and 78.spring assembly 60 may be initially installed with\nfree ends 70 resting upon the adjacent surface 46. Thus.\nduring the first few hours of rotation of rotor 24 with respect 4o\nr\nto stator 22,a small amount of each end fitting 72,74,76o\n78 will be worn away without causing damage to adjacent\nsurface 46. This s m a l l amount of wear establishes the\ndesired m h h u m clearance between free end 70 and rotor\nsurface 46.\n45\nThe overlapping configuration of the first set of spring\nteeth 62 with the second set of spring teeth 64 and the\nminimum clearance established between free ends 70 and\nrotor surface 46 cooperate to provide an effective mid-cavity\nthrottle within the associated fluid cavity. Also, the flexibility of spring teeth 62 and 64 will accommodate shaft\nvibration or whirl without causing damage to the other\ncomponents of the labyrinth seal system.\nIn FIG. Sa. first slots 66 and second slots 68are machined\non a radius extending from the longitudinal axis of rotor 24. 55\nModified spring assembly 60b is shown in FIG. 5b with first\nslots 66b machined at an acute angle relative a tangent\nextending from surface 46 of rotor 24.In FIG. 5b. this angle\nis shown as 45". Other angles may be used as desired for\noptimum performance of the associated labyrinth seal sys- 60\ntern\nEnd fittings 72,74,76 and 78 may be attached to their\nassociated spring teeth 62 and 64 by crimping, welding.\nbrazing or other appropriate manufacturing techniques. F r\no\nsome selected applications, end fittings 72,74,76 and 78 65\nmay be formed as an integral p r of the associated spring\nat\nteeth. End fittings 72. 74,76 and 78 may be formed from\n\n10\nself-lubricating, polymeric materials or non-galling metal\nalloys as desired. End fitting 72 shown in FIGS. 6a and 7 has\na relatively sharp point at its extreme lower end adjacent to\nsurface 46. End fittings 74,76 and 78 include an enlarged\nrelatively flat surface disposed adjacent to S u r f a x 46.\nEnd fitting 74,as shown in FIG. 6 . includes flat surface\nc\n80 enclosed on two sides by raised portions 82 and 84.Hat\nsurface 80and raised portions 82 and 84 cooperate with each\nother to provide fluid trap 80 between free ends 70 of\nflexible spring assembly 60 and surface 46 of rotor 24.Fluid\ntrap 80 h l i t s fluid flow on the exterior of rotor 24 adjacent\nto end fitting 74 and creates local pressure forces to lift free\nends 70 of flexible Spring teeth assembly 60radially outward\naPprO*telY\n0.001 inches from surface 46. This lifting\nforce establishes a very s m a l l clearance (c)\nwhich results in\ngreatly increased downstream turbulence.\nEnd fitting 76 also contains fluid trap 80. End fitting 78\nincludes a pair of fluid channels 88. Channels 88 increase\nturbulent intensity between end fitting 78 and rotor surface\n46.AS shown in FIGS. 80 and 86, spring teeth assembly 60\nmay be oriented at various angles with respect to rotor 24\nand also, With respect to fluid flow in the associated fluid\ncavity.

Support ring 6% also limits the amount of\n2\nflexing of the first set of spring teeth 62 and the second set\nof spring teeth 64 which may be caused by fluid flow\nthrough the associated fluid cavity 32. For labyrinth seal\nsystem 2Oa,support ring 630 includes tapered surface 6%.\nwhich also cooperates with the adjacent radial projection 54\nto direct fluid flow therebetween. End fitting 72 used in\nlabyrinth seal system 20a may be described as a non-lifting\ntip.\nLabyrinth seal system 20b incorporating alternative\nembodiments of the present invention is shown in FIG. 6b.\nFlexible spring teeth assembly 60 has been modified to\ninclude end fitting 74 which includes fluid trap 80. End\nfitting 74 may also be described as a lifting tip. Spring teeth\nassembly 60 includes modified support ring 6% with\nenlarged portion a b , which substantially deflects fluid flow\nwith respect to the adjacent radial projection 546.\nLabyrinth seal system u)b includes projections 526 and\n54b which extend radially from rotor 24. Radial projection\n52b includes flow surface 56 formed at an acute angle\nrelative to the longitudinal axis of rotor 24 and a second flow\nsurface 57 formed at a Merent angle relative to the longitudinal axis of rotor 2 .Radial projection 54b includes a first\n4\n\n5,639,095\n\n11\n\n12\n\nflow surface 58 which is formed n o d to the longitudinal\na x i s of rotor 24. and a second surface 59 which has a convex\nradius of curvature. As will be explained later in more detail,\nplacing convex surface 59 adjacent to a tight flow restriction\nsuch as enlarged portion 6%. substantially enhances the\nperformance of the associated labyrinth seal system by\nincreasing turbulence intensity therein.\nF G 7 shows an enlarged isometric view of flexible\nI.\nspring teeth assembly 60 used with labyrinth seal system\nu)n of FIG.6a.For some applications, it may be desirable\nto install flexible spring teeth assembly 60 secured to rotor\n24 with free ends 70 disposed adjacent to flow surface 42 of\nstator 22. For other applications, stator 22 may have a\nrelatively uniform inside diameter or flow surface 42 and\nrotor 24 may have a relatively uniform outside diameter or\nflow surface 46.For these types of labyrinth seal systems. a\nplurality of flexible spring teeth assemblies 60 may be\ninstalled between stator 22 and rotor 24. FIG. 18 is a\nschematic representation of such a labyrinth seal system.\nLabyrinth seal systems u f c through 201, which incorporate various embodiments of the present invention, are\nshown respectively in FIG. 9 through 18. Labyrinth seal\nsystems 20c through 201 demonstrate various seal designs\nand configurationsresulting from the present invention. The\nprincipal components used in the these various seal designs\ninclude convex surfaces 130. enlarged recess portions 140\nprovided in selectedfluid cavities, a plurality of annular flow\nreversal grooves 150, flexible spring teeth assemblies 60,\nrough machined surfaces 160 on selected portions of the\nfluid cavities, a pluraLity of deflector blocks 170 disposed on\nselected flow surfaces within each fluid cavity and rigid\nteeth 136.\nDotted lines are used in FIGS. 9 through 17 to indicate\nthat geometric designs of various components may be modified as desired to enhance the overall performance of the\nassociated labyrinth seal system. For example. labyrinth seal\nsystem 20c in FIG. 9 includes an enlarged recess portion 140\nrepresented by line 144. When labyrinth seal system 20c is\nused to control the flow of gas between rotor 24 and stator\n22. enlarged recess portion 144 may be expanded. When\nlabyrinth seal system u f c is used to restrict the flow of some\ntypes of liquids between stator 22 and rotor 24. enlarged\nrecess portion may be reduced as indicated by line 144. The\npresent invention allows modifying the recess portions to\nprovide the optimum performance of the associated labyrinth seal system with respect to the specific type of fluid\nflowing therethrough.\nAn important feature of labyrinth seal systems 20c\nthrough 20k is the use of convex surfaces to guide fluid flow\ninto selected portions of the labyrinth seal systems. Convex\nsurfaces WO shown in labyrinth seal system 20c serve as\nguide or direct fluid flow deep into the adjacent enlarged\nrecess portion 140. Convex surfaces 130 create a low\npressure or suction effect which directs fluid flow away from\nthe primary fluid flow stream through the associated labyrinth seal system. By directing fluid flow deep into enlarged\nrecess portion 140, turbulent intensity and the resullhg\ndissipation of fluid pressure energy as thermal energy are\nincreased which substantially reduces fluid pressure energy\nwithin labyrinth seal system 2Oc. Convex surfaces 130 are\nused at various locations within labyrinth seal systems 20c\nthrough 20k to direct fluid flow using this low pressure/\nsuction effect.\nFluid flow into enlarged recess portion 140 and the\nresulting turbulent action is further enhanced by placing\nradial projection 132 from stator 22 adjacent to eachconvex\n\nsurface 130. The resulting tight clearance (C) substantially\nenhances the performance of labyrinth seal system 2Oc.\nA plurality of annular flow reversal grooves 150 are\ndisposed in various portions of each labyrinth seal system\n20c through 20k. Annular flow reversal grooves 150 have a\nsemi-elliptical cross-section oriented to oppose the main\nfluid flow path through the respective labyrinth seal system.\nThe semi-elliptical cross-section is preferred for annular\nflow reversal grooves 150 so that fluid exiting each groove\n150 will oppose the main direction of fluid flow through the\nrespective labyrinth seal system.\nLabyrinth seal system 20d shown in F G 10 includes\nI.\nmany of the same features as previously described for\nlabyrinth seal system 20c and also includes rough surfaces\n160. Rough surfaces 160 may be formed on various surfaces\nwithin the associated fluid cavity 32. For labyrinth seal\nsystem 2Od, rough surfaces 160 have been formed on convex\nI.\nsurfaces 130. In labyrinth seal system 2Ofof F G 12, rough\nsurfaces 160 are formed on stator flow surfaces 42. Various\ntypes of surface finishes may be used to provide rough\nsurfaces 160. These finishes include phonograph finishes,\nsmall spiral helix grooves and other types of machine\nthreaded finishes. Rough surfaces 160 may be used to break\nup the boundary layer associated with fluid flow over the\nrespective surface within the associated fluid cavity 32.\nSmall flow deflector blocks 170 may also be formed on\nselected surfaces within fluid cavities 32 to enhance turbulent fluid flow. Flow deflector blocks 170 are particularly\neffective when they are located adjacent to and downstream\nfrom a tight restriction in the main fluid flow path of the\nassociated labyrinth seal system. For example, in labyrinth\nseal system 20j of FIG. 16, flow deflector blocks 170 are\nformed on rotor surface 46 and project into fluid channels\n88. For this application, flow deflector blocks 170 are\napproximately equal in height to the clearance between the\nassociated projection from stator 22 and rotor surface 46.\nThe height of deflector blocks 170 may vary from approximately one third of clearance (C) to two or three times\nclearance (C). At other locations. flow deflector blocks 170\nwill break up boundary layer flow over the respedive\nsurface. The use of rough surfaces 160 and flow deflector\nblocks 170 as boundary layer breakers substantially\nenhances the intensity of turbulent flow within the associated labyrinth seal system and further dissipates fluid pressure energy in the form of heat energy.\nLabyrinth seal system 20e as shown in F G 11 incorpoI.\nrates many of the features of previously described labyrinth\nO\nseal systems 20c and 2 d and also, includes a plurality of\nconvex surfaces 134 formed on radial projections 136.\nConvex surfaces 134 may be used to guide fluid flow in the\nsame manner as previously described for convex surface\n130. Labyrinth seal system 20e includes a plurality of\nannular flow reversal grooves 150 disposed within the\nassociated fluid cavities 32. If desired, enlarged annular\nrecessed portions 140 as shown by dotted lines, may be\nincluded within selected portions of labyrinth seal system\n20e. Fluid cavities 32 are defined. in part. by a plurality of\nprojections 136 extending generally towards each other.\nRadial projections 136 may have various configurations,\nincluding flow surface 56 formed at an acute angle relative\nto the longitudinalaxis of rotor 24 or flow surface 58 formed\nat an angle n o d to the longitudinal axis of rotor 24. The\nsolid line configuration of radial projections 136 as shown in\nFIG. 11 may be described as a plurality of interlocking fixed\nteeth disposed at an acute angle relative to the direction of\nfluid flow through labyrinth seal system 2Oe.\nLabyrinth seal system 20fas shown in FIG. 12 incorporates many of the same features as previously described for\n\n5\n\n1o\n\nl5\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n4o\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n5,639,095\n13\n\n14\n\nlabyrinth seal systems 20c. d, and e and also includes\nmultiple convex surfaces 13Oa and 130b within the associated fluid cavities 32.

Fixed teeth 136 are disposed at an acute angle\nrelative to the\nof fluid flow through labyrinth seal\nsystem 20f. If desired, end fittings 72,74.76, or 78 may be\nformed as an integral part of fixed teeth 1%. B~\nrough surfaces 160 with multiple convex surfaces l30a and\nWOb. along with enlarged recess portions 140, the performance of labyrinth seal system mf is substantidy\nenhanced.\nLabyrinth seal systems2Qgand 2&, as shown in FIGS. 13\nand 14, respectively, include many of the same features as\npreviously described for labyrinth seal systems 20c through\n2Qfand also include the use of annular flow reversal grooves\n150 disposed on projections 146 extending radially from\nrotor 24. For labyrinth seal system20g, a single annular flow\nreversal groove 150 is formed on each radial projection 146\nadjacent to stator surface 42. By placing annular flow\nreversal grooves on the end of radial projections 146,\nturbulent flow is substantially enhanced in the small clearance defined. in part, by the end of radial projection 146 and\nstator flow surface 42.\nLabyrinth seal system24Ji includes many of the features as\ndescribed in the previous labyrinth seal systems.
