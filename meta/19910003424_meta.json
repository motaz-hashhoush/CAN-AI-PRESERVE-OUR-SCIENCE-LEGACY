These facilities include unmanned satellites and platforms, manned elements, and transportation and servicing vehicles/elements. The latest existing definitions of typical unmanned GEO facilities and transportation and servicing vehicles/elements are utilized. The physical design, functional design, and operations implications at the space station are determined. Various concepts of the space station from past studies are utilized ranging from the IOC Multifunction Space Station to a branched transportation node space station and the implications of accommodating the GEO infrastructure at each type are assessed. Where possible, parametric data is provided to show the implications of variations in sizes and quantities of elements, launch rates, crew sizes, etc. The use of advanced automation, robotics equipment, and an efficient mix of manned/automated support for accomplishing necessary activities at the space station are identified and assessed. The products of this study are configuration sketches, resource requirements, trade studies, and parametric data.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910003424, "id": "68652fc57c224890b201c85137c29be3", "publicationDate": "1990-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910003424.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910003424/downloads/19910003424.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910003424/downloads/19910003424.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910003424/downloads/19910003424.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
