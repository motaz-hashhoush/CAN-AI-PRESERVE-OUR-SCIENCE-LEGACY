Eventually, the contractor's report arrived at my office. To my great disappointment, the proposed system came along with a multi-million dollar price tag. And, even more disappointing, the system relied on the same technology we already had in place and wouldn't deliver much additional functionality. It was clear that we needed to come up with a better solution-the best we could buy. But how do you buy the best technology, when you don't even know what technology is out there?", "title": "Smart Buying", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:23:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20030067678, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gonzalez, Steven A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "7ef4eee4b0de479587fbcbb1ee7de822"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-03-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030067678, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030067678, "id": "ae38d06e86394f31bac80bb92b0ffd5e", "publicationName": "ASK Magazine, No. 13", "publicationDate": "2003-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20030067672, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "ASK Magazine", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030067678.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030067678/downloads/20030067678.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030067678/downloads/20030067678.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030067678/downloads/20030067678.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
