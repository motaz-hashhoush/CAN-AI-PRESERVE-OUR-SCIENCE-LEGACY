The technology, developed at NASA Ames Research Center as a protective coating for flexible ceramic composites (PCC), is environmentally safe, water-based, and contains no solvents. Many other flame-retardant materials contain petroleum-based components, which can produce toxic smoke under flame. Wessex versions of PCC can be used to shield ceramics, wood, plasterboard, steel, plastics, fiberglass, and other materials from catastrophic fires. They are extraordinarily tough and exhibit excellent resistance to thermal shock, vibration, abrasion, and mechanical damage. One thin layer of coating provides necessary protection and allows for flexibility while avoiding excessive weight disadvantages. The coating essentially reduces the likelihood of the underlying material becoming so hot that it combusts and thus inhibits the \"flashover\" phenomenon from occurring.", "title": "Paper-Thin Coating Offers Maximum Protection", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020062182, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020062182, "id": "4a0b3cc266a444eba035b11609cef01f", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2001: Special Millennium Feature", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020062182.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020062182/downloads/20020062182.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020062182/downloads/20020062182.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020062182/downloads/20020062182.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
