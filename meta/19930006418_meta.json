The facility was designed, fabricated, installed, and tested as a turn-key project by Pitt-Des Moines Inc. and CVI Inc. The chamber has a 5.49 M by 6.10 M (18 ft by 20 ft) flat floor and a half-cylindrical roof with a diameter of 5.49 M (18 ft). Both ends of the chamber have full cross section doors, with one equipped with translating motors for horizontal motion. The chamber is provided with four 0.91 M (36 inches) cryopumps to obtain an ultimate pressure of 9 x 10(exp -8) Torr (Clean-Dry-Empty). The thermal shroud is designed to operate at a maximum of -179 C (-290 F) with an internal heat input of 316 MJ/Hr (300,000 BTU/Hr) using liquid nitrogen. The shroud is also designed to operate at any temperature between -156 C (-250 F) and 121 C (+250 F) using gaseous nitrogen, and heat or cool at a rate of 1.1 C (2 F) per minute.", "title": "A new thermal vacuum facility at the Martin Marietta Waterton plant", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930006418, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Watson, Robert N."}, "organization": {"name": "Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co.", "location": "Pittsburgh, PA, United States"}}, "id": "e0268dcb131b4e4e84be1762460f4948"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930006418, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bonn, John W."}, "organization": {"name": "CVI, Inc.", "location": "Columbus, OH., United States"}}, "id": "0132002975744623a7f23744f1a54368"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930006418, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930006418, "id": "3365b400187d43d7bd73d49e9f310885", "publicationName": "NASA.
