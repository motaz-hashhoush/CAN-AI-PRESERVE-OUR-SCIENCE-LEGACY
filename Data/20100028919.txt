Curlander, Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory\nAmong existing data compression algorithms, vector quantization (VQ) is an effective\nmethod of producing good reconstructed data\nquality at high compression ratios. VQ has been\nselected as the real-time downlink of the Earth\nObserving System on-board processor to ground\ndata users. The present data compression system combines a real-time encoding rate with a\nlow hardware cost by utilizing systolic array architecture for a tree-searched VQ algorithm. The\narray, consisting of a network of identical processing elements (PE) that rhythmically process\nand pass data among themselves, exploits\ndesign principles such as modularity, regular data\nflow, simple connectivity structure, localized communicating, simple global control, and paralleVpipeline processing functions. A fault-tolerant\nVQ encoder includes a spare PE and a means for\ndetection and replacement of a faulty PE with the\nspare to enhance system reliability.\nFor More Information Write In No. 778\n\nsured between predetermined points of the layers will indicate the strength of the magnetic field\nand thus produce a map of the magnetic body.\nFor More Information Write In No. 775\n\nAccelerometer Method and\nApparatus for Integral Display\nand Control Function\n(U.S. Patent 5,517, 183)\n\nInventor: Richard J.

Sisk, Marshall Space\nFlight Center\nHall effect measurements are indispensable\nto research on electric conduction and magnetic\nfield properties, especially in semiconductors.\nOne method of obtaining them is by means of a\nthin film of material that displays a high Hall coefficient and is deposited directly on the substrate.\nBut the only such materials suitable for conventional thin-film deposition such as sputtering are\nbismuth and some high-Tc superconductors.\nThe first is toxic, and the second group does not\npermit a wide range of adjustment in layer separation . The invention is the first to deposit on the\nsubstrate a duality of materials in thin films, one\nover the other, to produce a Hall effect device\nhaving a tunable Hall coefficient, the "third Hall\ncoefficient." Creation of the latter coefficient by\ncooperation of the first and second layers allows\nuse of materials for these layers that were previously ineffective because of their relatively weak\nHall coefficient. The invention further posits a\nmethod of obtaining a magnetic field map of a\nmagnetic body. By causing a bias current to flow\nin the first and second layers, and moving the\nmagnetic body in a direction substantially transverse to these elongated layers, a voltage mea-\n\nThe window in the accelerometer package at right\nshows bar graph elements such as light-emftting\ndiodes.

So,\nAllison contacted his racing rival\nRoger Penske of\nPenske Racing\nSouth, who had\na car that could\nbe loaned to\nKSC for a day to\nserve as the test\n\nShown above are veteran NASCAR driver Rusty\nWallace (left) and Kennedy Space Center\nDirector Jay Honeycutt prior to testing the thermal blanket insulation in Wallace \'s car at\nDaytona International Speedway.

Exhaust pipes running\nunder the driver\'s seat carry 600 to\n800\xc2\xb0F gases away from the engine. As a\nresult, temperatures in the driver compartment often reach dangerous levels of\nbetween 140 and 1600 F, causing some\ndrivers to be pulled semi-conscious from\ntheir cars after a race. Drivers often rely\non their own conditioning to be able to\nwithstand temperatures hot enough to\nmelt the soles of their right shoes (the\nones preSSing on the gas pedal). While\n\n20\n\nbed for the new application. The Miller\nFord Thunderbird driven by veteran racer\nRusty Wallace was delivered to KSC on\nOctober 12 of last year. A team from\nRockwell Space Systems Division\'s\nThermal Protection System Facility\n(TPSF) worked with Wallace, crew chief\nRobin Pemberton, and a NASA team led\nby KSC\'s TPS Facility Manager Bruce\nLockley, to design, build, and install the\ninsulation system in about 12 hours.\n\nA Patchwork Approach\nThe aluminus silicate material used\nhad been graded as either scrap, obso-\n\nlete, or generally not up to standards\nrequired for shuttle use. The material\nresembles house insulation; however, the\nshuttle material has a 1.3-micron diameter fiber, compared to the 30-micron\ndiameter fiber used in commercial insulation. Thus, the TPS material allows more\nfiber per square inch than house insulation. Pemberton provided patterns for\nthe material pieces, so the insulation\nblankets could be removed and installed\nin different cars.\nThe Penske team identified some of\nthe car\'s hottest spots, and the Rockwell\nteam fabricated two pieces of insulation\nto shield the driver. The first piece was\ntwo-inch-thick Flexible Insulation Blanket\n(FIB) material installed under the car\'s\nfloorpan to run between the floor and the\nexhaust system and cover the area from\nthe firewall back to behind the driver\'S\nseat. The second blanket, made of\nThermal Control System (TCS) material,\nwas placed under the driver\'s seat.\nAnother three blankets of TCS and FIB\nmaterial were used\nto insulate the transmission tunnel and\nfloor next to the\ncockpit. TCS material was used to\ncover\nboth the\ntransmission gear\nshifter and the engine oil tank, which\nsits six to eight\ninches behind the\ndriver. In the engine\ncompartment, two\nblankets made of\nthe material used on\nthe shuttle orbiter\'s\nwing were installed in front of the firewall.\nThe insulation added less than four\npounds to the 3400-pound car and cost\nNASA about $2000: $1000 for material\nand $1000 for labor. The material scraps\nwere small; if they were whole, the cost\nwould be about $6000. The cost could\nbe reduced significantly if the material is\nmass-produced by a commercial company. Suzanne Hodge of Rockwell\'s\nAdvanced Projects explained that the\nmaterial was made available under a\nSpace Act Agreement between KSC and\nPenske Racing that allows Rockwell to\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nTo anyone who is choosing between designing\nIn 20 or 30, we offer the following advice.\n\nDon\'t.\nIntroducing Autodesk Mechanical Desktop.\'"\nUniting 20 and 3D .\nFeature-based. parametric\nsolid modeling\n\nWith new Autodesk Mechanical Desktop you\n\nmake change effortless .

NASA\nagreed to work on the car with the\nunderstanding that other race teams will\nhave access to the material. Said\nPemberton: "We don\'t want to keep it to\nourselves. You don\'t want something like\nthis as an advantage over someone else.\nIf my guy is racing side-by-side with\nsomeone else, I want both of them to\nhave cool heads."\nOne of the most important considerations at the beginning of the project was\nwhether the refurbishments would be\napproved by NASCAR. But since the\ninsulation system does not enhance the\nperformance of the car, it is not prohibited by NASCAR. Winston Cup director\nGary Nelson explained that NASCAR\nwouldn\'t be involved unless it gets too\nexpensive. "One of our questions is cost\nto competitors. Anything like that, which\nis within reason cost-wise and helps the\ndriver, we don\'t get too involved in."\nAs for NASCAR approving the material\npieces, Nelson said that it comes under\nthe heading of driver performance, like\n"what kind of shoe he is going to wear."\nThe team was not, however, able to insulate the car\'s exhaust system, due to\nNASCAR regulations on performance\nenhancements.\n\nOne Coo/Car\nOnce installation of the TPS material\nwas complete, the next step was to test\nthe new insulation blankets. Would they\ncool the car\'s hot spots enough to reduce\ndriver compartment temperatures to\nbearable levels? The first test was a preliminary session held last November, in\nwhich Wallace\'s car idled in the garage\n\n22\n\narea until the oil temperature reached\n1650 F. The insulating material reduced\nthe surface of the tank to 75\xc2\xb0 F. The 90degree reduction in temperature is significant, given the fact that the oil cooler sits\nless than three inches from the driver\'s\nback.\n\nincluding below Wallace\'s foot. With the\ninsulation material in place, the temperature under Wallace\'s foot measured\n108\xc2\xb0F; with the material removed, the\ntemperature was 145\xc2\xb0 F.\nAnother hot spot under Wallace\'s left\nelbow was measured with just the external insulation in place. The temperature\nmeasured 120\xc2\xb0F; a blistering 260\xc2\xb0F was\nrecorded without the insulation. The difference in temperature of 140\xc2\xb0 is staggering, especially since the tests were\nrun with only the external insulation in\nplace. An even greater reduction in temperature is expected when the tests are\nrun with the interior insulation in place.\nThe KSC team will continue testing with\nPenske Racing to develop an insulation\nsystem that can be switched quickly from\none car to another, according to Lockley.\nThe data will allow NASCAR to determine\nif the system can be approved for use on\nall cars that race in NASCAR events.\nAt press time, Rockwell was negotiating a business development contract with\nPenske Racing, which specifies a commercial manufacturer of the blanket material and other details. After the agreement\nis signed, Rockwell will release the name\nof the manufacturer, the details of the\nproduct, and its cost. The non-proprietary\ntechnology could be used by other com-\n\nWallace pilots his Ford Thunderbird around the track at Daytona as part of a real-world\ntest of the TPS material installed under the Space Act Agreement between KSC and\nPenske Racing.\n\nOn April 10, the first high-speed test\nwas performed under race track conditions with full instrumentation to determine how well the thermal barrier system\nwould reduce hot-spot heat. At the\nDaytona International Speedway in\nFlorida, Wallace ran 20 2.5-mile laps in\nthe Thunderbird with only the external\nelements of the TPS system in place to\nreach a constant temperature level. He\nthen drove the same distance with the\nmaterial removed. Computer-based sensors and data recorders measured temperatures in the car at the hot spots,\n\npanies to manufacture similar products.\nRockwell hopes to have the commercial\nproduct available before the end of the\nNASCAR racing season in November.\nMartin Wilson, Rockwell\'s TPS Facility\nproject manager, is sure that "the system\nwill significantly improve environmental\nconditions for race car drivers. This is\nanother good example of how technology developed for the space program can\nbe used for applications on Earth. n\nFor more information, contact Bruce\nLockley of Kennedy Space Center at\n407-861-5381.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nVISUALIZE THE POWER\n\nMATIAB\nfor Engineering i\n\nOF YOUR PROGRAMS\n\nPowerful object-oriented\ngraphics offer interactive\nanalysis and dynamic\nmodeling.

The data\nare referred globally to a spherical reference frame and can be presented by\nuse of sinusoidal projected flat -surface\nmathematical models.\nThe program can handle tens of\ngigabytes of input image data and is\nscalable to very large, massively parallel processing computers. It can generate high-quality, high-resolution images\nin nearly real time when operating in a\nstand-alone or batch mode. Alternatively, an interactive interface in the\nprogram can be used to explore large\nvolumes of remote-sensing image data\nin real time, or to simulate flight over\nplanetary terrain.\nThis software can be run on a Cray\nT3D computer and an Intel Paragon\ncomputer (or equivalents), rendering\nimages at a rate of 2 frames per second.\nFor operation in the interactive mode, it\nis also necessary to use an SGI com puter with texture-mapping and a HiPPI\n\nframe buffer connected to the parallel\nprocessing computer via a HiPPI network. It has been demonstrated by\nusing it in interactive simulation of flight\nover the California and Nevada desert\nas rendered from 650MB Landsat\nimagery of that area, and in simulation\nof flight over Mars from an 860MB\nglobal set of Mars image data.

The system can be characterized as analog in/analog out, with the\nrelationships among inputs and outputs\ndetermined by software running in the\ndigital part of the system . The digital/\nanalog implementation was chosen\nbecause it is impractical to simulate\nlags of the order of tens of minutes or\nhours by use of simple analog circuitry in which the lags are established in\nthe customary way by use of resistors\nand capacitors.\nThe thermal system to be simulated is\nrepresented by a conventional multinode resistance-and-capacitance thermal model that is implemented in software in a personal computer. In deriving\nthe equations on which the software is\nbased, the differential equations for the\ntemperatures at the various nodes in the\nmodel are converted to a first-order\nmatrix difference equation of the form\nTk = (C,/\'tj(G8 + C,/\'tj-1 Tk_ +\n1\n(G 8 +C,/\'tj-l (Of + O,J,\nwhere Tk and Tk 1 are the vectors of\nnodal temperatures at the kth and\nk-1 st sampling intervals, respectively;\nC 8 is a matrix of thermal capacitances\nfrom the model; G8 is a matrix of thermal\nconductances from the model; Of is a\nvector of environmental heat inputs\nfrom the model; OM is a vector of heat\ninputs that represent the heater power\nlevels commanded by the heater-control\n34\n\nvoltages; and -r is the sampling period.\nThe computer is equipped with an\nanalog-to-digital circuit board, which\nreceives the heater-control voltages\nfrom the temperature-control circuits\n\nwould be produced by thermistors or\nother suitable temperature sensors.\nThese analog voltages are fed as temperature inputs to the temperature-control circuits under test.\n\nDigitaVAnalog Simulation System\n\nHeaterControl\nSignals\n\nTemperature-Control\nCircuits Under Test\n\nSimulated\nThermistor\nReadings\n\nThe Simulation System produces thermistor outputs like those of a thermal system with long\nlags. It is used to test the temperature-control circuits in the absence of the thermal system .\nThe simulation system can be characterized as analog in/analog out, with the relationships\namong inputs and outputs determined by software running in the digital part of the system.\n\nunder test and converts them into digital\nlevels. The software uses these levels to\ncompute the heater power that would\nbe commanded by each heater-control\nvoltage and thus computes the corresponding rate of heat input for the mathematical model.\nThe software then simulates the realtime response of the system to the\nheater-control voltages, such that the\ndigital output of the software consists of\nreal-time series of digital data that represent the sampled, digitized outputs of\nthe temperature sensors in the simulated system. Digital-to-analog circuits in\nthe computer convert these digital outputs to analog voltages like those that\n\nThermal and/or electrical disturbances and error signals can be incorporated into the response of the simulated system via software. For example,\nthe digital voltages representative of the\nthermistor readings can be modified,\nthereby modifying the simulated analog\nthermistor readings to determine what\neffect erroneous thermistor readings\nwould have on the behavior of the overall system comprising the thermal system and the temperature controllers .\nThis work was done by David I.\nBergman of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

The model can be applied\nto single- and multicomponent flows in\nvarious turbopump components over a\nwide range of flow speeds. Although the\nmodel was originally intended for use in\ndesigning rocket-engine turbopumps, it\ncan be used in the design and analysis\nof turbopumps in general.\nIn the past, preliminary designs of\npump components have been based on\npotential-flow analyses and empirical\ndata. Because of the ever-increasing\nperformance requirements of rocketengine turbopumps, designs of these\npumps have been pushed beyond the\nlimits of past experience. The present\nmodel satisfies the need for an enhanced analysis capability to enable\nprogress beyond these limits. The greatest challenge in the development of this\nmodel was to obtain computational efficiency in the presence of complex geometries, terms that represent the effects\nof turbulence, and large source terms\n\nthat represent the effects of Coriolis and\ncentrifugal forces.\nThe present model and the computer\nprogram that implements it were developed by modification and extension of\nthe Finite Difference Navier-Stokes\n(FDNS) computer program and model.\nAs its name suggests, the FDNS program solves the applicable version of the\nNavier-Stokes equations of flow by a\nfinite-difference method. The development included the incorporation of several submodels for simulation of flow\nfields in turbomachines. Because the\ncentrifugal and Coriolis forces are very\nlarge in advanced pump designs, one of\nthe submodels uses an implicit numerical-solution scheme to process the large\nsource terms.\nAnother submodel implements a\nhigh-order upwind/central-difference\nnumerical-solution scheme plus adaptive second- and fourth-order dissipation terms. The high-order numericalsolution scheme is necessary for accuracy of predictions of cross-stream secondary flows generated by curved blade\n\nC2 - THE COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATION\n\nElectronics Design Exposition\nConference:May 13-161Show:May 14-16. 1997.

Accordingly, the present model\nincorporates a fourth sub model which\nutilizes a multiblock, multizone methodology to solve the grid-generation problem in the presence of complex geometries and moving interface boundaries.\nFinally, a pressure-based, predictorplus-multicorrector solution algorithm\nwas selected as another submodel to\nsimulate the flow fields within the turbopump components, which flows are\nknown to be influenced primarily by\npressure and turbulence.\nBecause of its very compact numerical structure, short computation time,\nand versatility for different geometries,\nthe present model is an efficient analytical tool for designing turbopumps. In a\nprocess of verification of the model as\napplied to various turbopump components, the model has proven to be very\nrobust and capable of predicting the\nturbulent flow structure of each component. Proposals for modification of\npump designs to improve performance\nhave been derived from analyses conducted by use of the model. Moreover,\nexperience gained from the extensive\nnumerical investigations has led to recommendations for improving the present model.\nThis work was done by Gary C.\nCheng of SECA, Inc., for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.

This circuit\nprovides load current of the required\nmagnitude in either polarity, as needed,\nfrom a single power supply of fixed\npolarity. Unlike some older magneticbearing drive circuits, this circuit does\nnot maintain load current at a constant\nhigh level in the absence of control disturbances; instead, it provides load current only when required to counteract\ncontrol disturbances. Thus, the present\ncircuit consumes less power during\nnominal operation.\nThe figure is a simplified schematic\ndiagram of the circuit. Bidirectionality of\nload current from a single power supply\nis achieved by use of an H-bridge, which\ncomprises switching transistors 01\nthrough 04, diodes D1 through D4, and\n\n+\n\nresistors RS1 and RS2 . The diodes help\nto commutate the inductive transients in\nthe load current. The switching transistors are operated in a self-oscillating\nmode to achieve fast response and stability of control while providing load current only as required according to the\npower-saving scheme described above.\nEach switching transistor is alternately driven fully "on" and fully "off."\nResistors RS1 and RS2 serve as current-sensing shunts; the voltages across\nthese resistors are fed to the input terminals of differential amplifier IC1 . The\noutput of IC1 is a voltage proportional to\nthe sum of currents in the two branches\nof the H-bridge and thus proportional (in\nboth sign and magnitude) to the actual\nload current. This voltage is fed to one of\nthe two input terminals of differential\namplifier IC2, while a control voltage\nproportional to the commanded current\nis fed to the other input terminal of IC2.\n\nThe output of IC2 is thus a voltage\nproportional to the difference between\nthe commanded and actual load currents; in other words, an error signal that\ncan be used to adjust the load current.\nThis error signal is fed to one of the input\nterminals of IC3, which is configured as\na Schmitt trigger with a built-in hysteresis. This hysteresis provides the mechanism for the self-oscillation, which produces an oscillation of the load current\naround the commanded value. The\namount of hysteresis and thus the frequency of this oscillation is chosen\naccording to the amount of ripple current desired, the effective inductance of\nthe load, and the power-supply voltage.\nThe output of the Schmitt trigger is\nfed through inverters IC4 and IC5 to drivers for the switching transistors in the\nH-bridge. In the first half cycle of the\noscillation, the input/output state of the\nSchmitt trigger and these inverters is\n\nPower\nSupply\n\nControl Voltage\n(Current Command)\n\nAn H-Bridge of Switch ing Transistors and Diodes commutates the load current. The circuit operates in a self-oscillation mode in which the\npolarity of switching in the H-bridge is repeatedly reversed to make the load current oscillate about a commanded value.\n\n42\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nPrecision Ball Bearing\nScrews\n\nRapidtrak Linear Actuators\nA compact, self-contained self-supporting,\nmodular designed, linear actuator.

When this\nthreshold is reached , the Schmitt trigger\nreverses its state and the circuit goes\n\ninto the second half cycle of the oscillation, in which the power-supply voltage\nis applied to the load in the opposite\ndirection (e.g ., by switching 02 and 03\non while switching 01 and 04 off), so\nthat the load ramps down a threshold\nvalue equal to the commanded value\nminus the hysteresis increment. The\ncycle then repeats.\nIf the commanded current is changed,\nthen the appropriate switching transistors are driven to apply the source volt-\n\nage in the appropriate direction until the\nactual load current reaches the new\ncommanded current plus or minus the\nhysteresis increment. Thereafter, the circuit oscillates about the new commanded load current.\nThis work was done by John\nPaulkovich and G. Ernest Rodriguez of\nGoddard Space Flight Center.

GSC-13717\n\nSynchronizing the CD4047B Monostable/Astable Multivibrator\nTwo techniques provide for synchronization with external oscillators.\nGoddard Space Right Center; Greenbelt, Maryland\nTwo techniques for synchronizing the\nCD4047B integrated circuit with external oscillators have been devised. The\nCD4047B is a low-power complementary - metal-oxide/sem icon d uctor\n(CMOS) circuit that can be configured,\nvia external connections, to operate as\nan astable or as a monostable multivibrator. The two techniques apply to the\nastable mode of operation.\nThe top part of the figure illustrates\none of the techniques for synchronization. The signal from an external squarewave oscillator is coupled through differentiator C" R, and switching diode D1\non the way to the CD4047B. To make\nsynchronization possible, the external\noscillator must oscillate at a frequency\ngreater than the free-running frequency\nof oscillation of the CD4047B in the\nastable mode. When the external oscillator fails, the CD4047B reverts to the\nfree-running frequency.\nThe bottom part of the figure illustrates the other technique for synchronization. This technique is suitable for\nuse in conjunction with optional use of a\ndivide-by-2 circuit that is part of the\nCD4047B. In this technique, the differentiator and switching diode of the preceding technique are replaced with a different diode. In this case, during synchronization , the external oscillator runs\nat twice the desired output frequency of\nthe CD4047B and a D flip-flop that is\npart of the internal divide-by-2 circuit is\ntriggered on the positive-going edges of\nthe signal from the external oscillator.

This pulse generator is\ndesigned to supply short-rise-time and\nshort-fall-time pulses simultaneously to a\ncontinuous load and to high-current\npower metal oxide/semiconductor fieldeffect transistors (MOSFETs) that have\ncapacitive input impedances. Uke the\ncommercial unit, this pulse generator is\nalso suitable for use as a laboratory\n\ninstrument that provides periodic waveforms of adjustable repetition frequency,\nadjustable pulse duration, and adjustable\namplitude with minimal output waveform\njitter at low frequencies.\nIn the commercial unit, the frequencies\nand durations of pulses are adjusted by\nvarying settings of potentiometers within\nfrequency and duration ranges that are\nselected by switching capacitors of various values into and out of a timing circuit. The frequency- and duration-range\n\nswitches are interlocked at coincident\nsettings in a manner that is dictated by\nthe fundamental limitations of the timing\ncircuit and that imposes limits on the\nranges of attainable combinations of frequency and duration settings.\nThe present pulse generator operates\nsimilarly, but the limits are less severe.\nMoreover, this pulse generator covers\nmuch wider frequency and duration\nranges via potentiometer settings alone,\nwithout switching of capacitors; for\n\n5t017Vdc\n\n,-----------------------\n\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n1N4001\n\nI LM317T I\nIV, adl\xc2\xb7 VOl\n.\n\n+\n\nI\nI\n\n20 V\nto 40 V\n\n237\nn\n\n1N4001\n\n;:r: ~\'~\n\n?\n\n.~r:\n\n1.2\nIlF\n\n3kll ..{\n619n\n\n1\n\n51 n\n\nf-\'237\nn\n\nN2907A\n\n0.1\nI1F\n\n1~r:\n\n5 Mn ..{~\n\n510n\n\n;~\n\n1.69\n\xc2\xbb kll\n\nI1F\n\n1N916\n\nL _______\n\n"\'-\n\n\\\n\n8 14\n\n7\n\n~\n\n10\nI1F\n\ni}?1\n\n1-\n\n-\'-\n\n6\n\n1N4001\n\nA\n\nSOKn\n\no~gc\n\nlM317T\nVi\nVo\nadj.\n\nI1F\n\n.,;;. 270 n\n\n:r.v-.\n\nLM555CN\nor\nlMC555CN\n\n100\npF\n\n1 ~0.Q1\n\nTiming\nCapacitor\n(0.01511Fl\n\n-b-\n\nI1F\n\n2.4\nkll\n\n~r-\n\n~\n\n2N236 9\n\nI1F\n\n-=\n\n-------------Astable Oscillator\n\n-==\n=\n\n,..-------,\n,\n,\n\n----\n\n2.5mH\n\n--------~\n\n100\nI1F\n6\n\n5Mn\n\n2.0 : 1N916\nklll\n\n3\n\nVo\n\n0.111F\n2\n\nI\n___ I\n\n7\nTSC428\nVo\n\n4.7\nkll\n\n2N4351\n\n4\n\n5\n3\n\n-=\n\nPulse-repetition frequency: adjustable from 14.7 Hz to 167 kHz\nPulse duration: adjustable from 2 I1S to 68 ms. with duty cycle from 20 to 80" 0 at 100kHz and with a nearly infinite duty cycle at low frequencies\n1\nPulse amplitude: adjustable from 5 to 17 V\n\nThis Pulse Generator Is Adjustable, via potentiometer settings, over a relative-frequency range of more than 10,000: 1, with no interaction\nbetween pulse-frequency and pulse-duration adjustments.\n\n46\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nexample, it can be set to pulse periods\nfrom 6 lJS to 68 ms (pulse-repetition frequencies from 167 kHz to 14.7 Hz) and\npulse durations from 2 lJs to 68 ms, all\nwith a single timing capacitance value,\nwhereas it takes fIVe switched-capacitor\nfrequency settings and five switchedcapacitor duration settings to cover the\nsame ranges in the commercial unit.\nThe pulse generator Is based on one of\nthe versions of a popular integrated-circuit timer that is commonly denoted in\nthe industry as "555" with various letter\nprefixes and suffixes. The design of the\n555 timer, however, limits the magnitude\nof the timing-capacitor discharge current\nthrough an internal discharge transistor.\nIn addition, one must limit the power dissipated within the timer circuit. For a\ncomplex of reasons that cannot be\nexplained in the space available for this\narticle, these limits on current and power\ngive rise to similar frequency- and duration-range limitations described above\nfor the commercial unit.\nThe present pulse generator is designed to circumvent these inherent\ndischarge current and power limits.\nThis circuit (see figure) contains two\nLM555CN or LMC555CN timers; one of\nthem functions as an astable oscillator,\nthe other as a variable-pulse-duration\none-shot. A separate 2N2907 A pnp\ntransistor is connected to each timer to\ndischarge the corresponding timing\ncapacitor, instead of using the discharge\ntransistor within the timer. This modification circumvents the discharge-current limit. Furthermore, because the\nexternal transistor also diverts the constant-load component of the current\nthrough the charging resistors away\nfrom the internal discharge transistor,\nthis modification also reduces the power\ndissipated in the timer. The 2N3763 transistor prevents further charging and discharge of the one-shot timing capaCitor\nuntil the proper time to prevent interaction between the pulse-frequency and\npulse-duration adjustments and to eliminate an instability, also present in the\ncommercial unit, where the output frequency suddenly halves while attempting to establish a relatively high duty\ncycle. The 2N4351 insulated-gate FEr\nisolates the one-shot output from the\nT8C428 dual-M08FEr driver to minimize output waveform jitter and also\nacts as a step-down voltage-level shifter\nto meet the specified safe operating limit\nof the M08FEr-driver input.\nOvercoming the current and power\nlimits makes it possible to use discharge\nand timing resistances much lower, and\ncapacitances much higher, than those\nrecommended in the 555-timer literature\nfor the desired pulse frequencies and\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nDASYLal1\nData Acquisition\nSoftware from IOtech\nTry DASYlab\nfrom 10000h for\nyour next\nWindows-based\ndata acquisition\napplication and get fast. flexible solutions in\nminutes, not weeks.

M92Si is a commercially available compound into which lithium can\nbe intercalated. In comparison with lithium itself and with carbon-based lithiumintercalation materials that have been\ntried thus far, Mg2Si as the anode material offers potential advantages of greater\nsafety and longer cycle life.\nThe charge/discharge cycle lives of\ncells containing lithium anodes tend to\nbe terminated prematurely by short-circuiting caused by the growth and penetration of lithium dendrites through the\nanode/cathode separators. The approach\ntaken in recent developments Oncluding\nthe present development) to solve the\nsafety and cycle-life problem s has\nbeen to use lithium alloys and other\nlithium-intercalation materials that exhibit lithium activities lower than that of\npure lithium .\nCarbon-based materials have been\ninvestigated for use as lithium-intercalation anode materials because of their\nlow equivalent weights, low voltages\nversus lithium, and chemical stability\nin the presence of various electrolytes.\nHowever, the carbon-based materials\nhave exhi bited various deficiencies: For\nexample, graphite (which has twice the\nlithium capacity of coke) is vulnerable to\nshort-circuiting by dendrites during\ncharging because its potential is too\nclose to that of elemental lithium. Moreover, development problems are complicated by the fact that the electrochemical properties of carbon-based\nmaterials depend strongly on which\nelectrolytes are used.\n\nMg2Si was selected as a candidate\nlithium-intercalation anode material because its electrochemical behavior is\n\nthe capacity-vs.-cycle-life data presented in the figure, the tests showed that\nthe cell exhibited a high degree of lithium\n\n0.8 - r - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - . ,\n0.7\n\n0.6\n0.5\n.c:\n\nci.:\n\n\'1\n\n0.4\n\n() 0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\no\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nCycle Number\n\nDischarge Capacities were measured during 70 charge/discharge cycles of a Mg 2Sianode/electrolyte/LiCo02 -cathode cell at a current density of 0.362 mAlcm 2 .\n\nsimilar to that of carbon-based materials\nin some ways, yet advantageously different in other ways.

The F-15 is powered by two\nF100-derivative (PW1128) afterburning\nturbofan engines. The PSG system executes adaptive, model-based control\nalgorithms formulated to optimize the\nquasi-steady-state performance of the\nF-15 propulsion system. The PSG system can function in any of three optimization modes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Minimum fuel flow at constant thrust,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Minimum turbine temperature at constant thrust, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maximum thrust at maximum dry and\nfull afterburner throttle settings.\nThe PSG algorithm implements estimation, modeling, and optimization\nprocesses (see Figure 2). The estimation\nprocess involves a Kalman-filter estimation of five component deviation para-\n\nmeters designed to account for the\noff-nominal behavior of the engine\nduring flight. The estimated component deviation parameters are used\nto update the compact engine model\n(GEM) (a mathematical model of\nengine and inlet flow conditions in\nresponse to control inputs) to reflect\nactual engine operation, which can\nvary from engine to engine; this is\nthe adaptive feature of PSG. The\nmodeling process starts with the\nGEM to estimate unmeasured engine\noutputs required to obtain an optimal solution.The GEM is then augmented with models of the inlet, nozzle, and horizontal tail to formulate a\nmodel of the complete aircraft. Flight\nmeasurements are used to look up\nmodel data and as direct inputs to\nthe Kalman filter and the GEM . The\noptimization process then analyzes\nthe augmented model (for one of the\nthree modes of operation) and produces a set of optimal variables,\nwhich are sent to the inlet and engine controlle rs.\nThe flight tests were conducted at both\nsubsonic and supersonic speeds. The\n\nresults of the flight tests indicate that\nsubstantial benefits were obtained from\nthe F-15 PSG algorithm. In the maximum-thrust mode, thrust levels were\nobserved to increase as much as 15\npercent at subsonic and 10 percent at\nsupersonic speeds. In the minimumturbine-inlet-temperature mode, temperatures were observed to be reduced\nby as much as 100 OF (56\xc2\xb0C) at high\naltitudes. In the minimum-fuel-flow\nmode, fuel -consumption rates were\nfound to be reduced by as much as 2\npercent in subsonic and 10 percent in\nsupersonic flight. On the basis of\nthese results, it appears that the initial\nobjectives in developing PSG technology have been achieved and that PSG\ntechnology can provide significant\nbenefits for the next generation of\nfighter airplanes or any other aircraft\nin which there is a high degree of integration between the airframe and the\npropulsion system.\nThis work was done by G.

The apparatus (see figure) is a\nprototype of signal generators that\nwould produce the ultralinear, wideband\nswept-frequency signals that are needed for high performance in such applications as chirp radar and querying of multiple fiber-optic-coupled sensors.\nIn this apparatus, the frequency sweep\nrate of a radio-frequency sweep generator (a voltage-controlled oscillator controlled by a ramp signaQ and a long fiberoptic delay line are used to generate\nanother signal with a fixed low frequency\nthat is directly related to the sweep rate\nand that can be locked to a stable, fixedfrequency reference. The swept-radiofrequency signal is amplitude-modulated\nonto an optical carrier generated by a\nlaser, and the resulting optical signal is\ncoupled into the near end of the fiberoptic delay line. The optical signal travels\nto the far end of the delay line, where it is\nreflected. Upon returning to the near end,\n54\n\nthe delayed (output) optical signal is coupled into a photodiode along with the\nnon delayed (input) optical signal.\n\nThe difference between the phases of\nthe amplitude modulation on the input\nand output signals changes at a rate of=\n\nI+---!--"\'-"---i~\n\n45\xc2\xb0\nFaraday\nRotator\n\n~\n\n_\nOutput\n\nPartial\nMirror\n\nThe Frequency-Sweep Rate Is Stabilized by using the fiber-optic delay line to convert the\nsweep rate to frequency oj\' and locking w\' to the stable frequency reference.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\na -r, where a is the frequency-sweep rate\nand \'t" is the delay. Therefore, the mixing\nof the input and output modulation signal in the photodiode introduces a component at a frequency of of into the photodiode output current. This frequency\nis forced to be constant by phase-locking it to the stable frequency reference.\nThen provided that the delay remains\nconstant, the sweep rate is also forced to\nremain constant; in other words, the frequency sweep is forced to be linear.\nThe phase lock needed to stabilize 01\'\nand a is accomplished as follows: The\n\nHigh-ResolutionRadar and PowerTransmission\nSystem\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, Pasadena,\nCalifornia\nA proposed millimeter-wave radio\nsystem would provide high-resolution-radar for detecting debris as\nsmall as 1 mm orbiting the Earth and\nfor mapping asteroids out to distances of Mars\' closest approach.

Instead, the display system provides an\neasily and rapidly readable summary\nindication of status of the aircraft.\nThe display consists of a horizontal\nrow of colored lights over the aircraft\ninstrument panel (see figure). Green\nlights in the center indicate that the aircraft is operating within the maneuver\nenvelope. The green lights are flanked\nby yellow lights, which indicate the aircraft is approaching the limits of the\nenvelope.

The software\nand the maneuver-envelope data needed for these computations are stored in\na read-only memory. The digital output of\nthe CPU is converted to an analog voltage indicative of the status of the sensed\noperating parameters relative to operational limits. This voltage controls the\ndisplay of colored lights. Optionally, on\nits way to the display circuit, this voltage\ncan be fed through a filter to prevent the\ndisplay from changing too rapidly for the\npilot to read.\nThis work was done by Courtland C.\nBivens, Joel M.

The technique\nalso exploits the unique optical properties of a layer of material that is applied\nto the test surface for the purpose of\nthis measurement.\nAs in a contact-type measurement,\nthe heat flux through the test surface is\ncomputed as the heat flux through a\nlayer of material, one of the surfaces of\nwhich is in contact with the test surface.\nIn Figure 1, the test surface is in contact\nwith surface 2. The equation for this\nmeasurement is q = K{TrT,)/t, where q\nis the rate of flow of thermal energy per\nunit area conducted through the layer\nfrom surface 2 to surface 1, /( is the thermal conductivity of the layer, t is the\nthickness of the layer, and T2 and T, are\nthe temperatures of surfaces 2 and 1,\nrespectively.

These\nmethods involve various degrees of\nmanual inteNention and/or processing\nof image data by hardware- and computation-intensive techniques like correlation of image densities. The present\nmethod, called "fuzzy PTV," is an attractive alternative to correlation-based\nmethods because no specialized hardware is necessary for reduction and\nanalysis of data. Moreover, direct digital\nrecording of the particle images can\nsimplify the processing of image data.\nThe fuzzy process can be executed in\nsoftware on a personal computer, without using specialized array or fuzzylogic processors.\nThe overall task is to estimate the\nvelocity field in one plane of a flowing liquid by seeding the liquid with small,\nhighly reflective particles. illuminating\nthe plane of interest with intense light\nfrom a pulsed laser or other source,\nrecording a sequence of images of the\nilluminated particles over a short time,\nand processing the image data to\ndetermine local velocity vectors from\ndisplacements of particles. Some methods involve processing of data from\nmultiple-exposure, single-frame photographs. Other methods involve sequences of two or more single-exposure\nphotographic or video images on independent frames; fuzzy PTV is such a\nmethod, and requires only two singleexposure frames.\nThe image data from the two frames\nare acquired directly from a charge-coupled-device video camera. The data\nfrom each frame are processed independently to determine the particle-image centroids. The centroid locations\nare stored and used to determine candidate displacement vectors. Velocity vectors are calculated by dividing the displacement vectors by the interexposure\ntime. Of course, the big problem in\nconstructing the velocity vectors is to\ndetermine which particle-image centroids in the second frame represent the\nsubsequent positions of which particleimage centroids in the first frame.\nThe centroids in the first frame are\nused as starting points for candidate\nparticle displacements. The user specifies a search radius, typically between 10\nand 20 pixels, that defines a circular\nregion around each first-frame centroid,\nand a search for second-frame centroids\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nBuilt to match the speed of the\nfastest computer systems while\nproviding the high capacity needed\nto handle massive amounts of data,\nthe CY-9000 half-inch digital DTF\ndrive is a performance breakthrough.\ntore 42 GB on a ingle tape,\nuncompressed.\nave time and resources by\nwriting directly to tape at a record\nbreaking speed of 12 MB per\nsecond - 43 gigabytes per hour over a terabyte every day.\nChoose from FastlWide CSI,\nUltra SCSI, ESCON, and IBM\nChannel interfaces for plug\n\ncompatibility with the widest range\nof systems.\nAvailable in a desktop or rack\nmount configuration, the drive\nfeatures a 32 MB data buffer.

In areas of high data density, search\nregions could overlap, so that many firstframe centroids could be found competing for the same second-frame centroids.\nAll candidate displacements in each\nsearch region are recorded and stored as\nlists of candidate displacement vectors\nfor the particle in question.\nIn fuzzy PT\'J, a fuzzy inference processor operates on the lists of candidate displacement vectors to determine the most\nlikely displacement vector for each particle represented by a first-frame centroid.\nThe list of vectors for each first-frame\ncentroid is compared with the corresponding lists for all the other first-frame\ncentroids. If two first-frame centroids\nclaim the same second-frame centroid\n(see figure), then all possible vector pairs\nthat involve these two first-frame centroids are compared. The main assumption is that if the particles represented by\ntwo first-frame centroids are close\nenough to claim the same second-frame\ncentroid, then their velocities are probably\nalmost the same, so that the pair of vec-\n\ntors that most resemble each other in\ndirection and magnitude must be the correct pair of displacement vectors for the\ntwo particles.\nFuzzy logic is well-suited to this application for the same reason that has\nmade it useful in controlling complex systems; it is capable of making control\ndecisions from incomplete and imprecise\ninput data according to imprecisely\ndefined rules. In this application, it controls the selection of velocity vectors on\nthe basis of fuzzily defined "common\nsense" rules that a human observer\nwould use to identify particle tracks.\nThere are four inputs to the fuzzy\nprocessor for each vector pair: (1) the distance (in pixels) between the midpoints of\nthe vectors, (2) the average of the magnitudes of the two vectors, (3) the difference between the magnitudes of the two\nvectors, and (4) the sum of the squares of\nthe differences between the corresponding components of the two vectors. Each\ninput is assigned to a fuzzy set, wherein\nthe degree of membership for each element in the set varies between 0 and 1.\nThe degrees of membership for each\ninput are processed through a rule base\nof "IF...THEN" blocks. The rule base de-\n\nfines an output fuzzy set. For a given vector pair, up to 16 rules may fire, depending on the number of unique combinations of membership values. In lieu of a\ncentroiding technique that is more common in fuzzy logic, this fuzzy processor\ncomputes its output via the singleton\ntechnique with a weighted average,\nwhich is computationally simpler.\nAn initial test of fuzzy PTV was performed on two PTV images of oil seeded\nwith particles held in a transparent reservoir and convecting under the influence\nof a heater in the reservoir. The images\ncontained 316 and 318 centroids, respectively. A total of 1141 candidate vectors were identified. From these vectors,\nthe fuzzy processor produced a velocity-field map of 209 vectors in a processing time of 7.6 s.\nThis work was done by Mark P Wernet\nof Lewis Research Center.

In one process, for example, the first step is to\nsputter-clean the substrate by use of a\nbeam of oxygen and argon ions at kinetic energies between 200 and 500 eV.\nThen a beam of argon ions at kinetic\nenergies between 500 and 5,000 eV is\nused to sputter-etch aluminum from an\naluminum target that faces the substrate, causing aluminum to be deposited on the substrate (see figure).\n\nAt the same time, chemically active\nmonatomic and ionic oxygen is brought\nto the surface of the substrate by use\nof a beam of oxygen ions at kinetic\nenergies less than 100 eV.

Called "nanostructured flame retardants: these powders can be used as\ningredients of flame-retardant coatings or blended into composite polymeric materials to make fabrics and structural\ncomponents that are flame-retardant throughout their thicknesses. The principal ingredient of nanostructured fire retardants tested in preliminary experiments was nanostructured\nantimony oxide (see figure), which was synthesized from\nmicron-particle-size antimony oxide powder in a subatmospheric-pressure chamber by thermal evaporation and condensation onto a cooled surface.\nBecause of the high specific surface areas associated with\ntheir small particle sizes, nanostructured flame retardants are\ncharacterized by relatively high reactivity and correspondingly\nhigh effectiveness as flame retardants. The small particle sizes\nmake it possible to blend these materials with other materials\nat a near-molecular level of fineness and interpenetration.\nUnlike older flame-retardant additives with larger particle\nsizes, nanostructured flame retardants can be incorporated into\nmicron- and submicron-sized fibers; this can be an important\nadvantage in making clothing that stays flame-retardant, as\ncontrasted with clothing made flame-retardant by coating\nmaterials that can come off with repeated washing. In another\npotential class of applications, nanostructured flame retardants\ncould be incorporated into microelectronic devioes, in which\nparticles of excessive size could adversely affect performance.\nThis work was done by Shahid Pirzada and Tapesh Yadav of\nNanomaterials Research Corp. for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

It is generic in the sense that it can\nbe applied to any problem in which activities are placed on a time line while\nrespecting a variety of constraints,\nincluding resource, temporal, and state\nconstraints. It is nonchronological in the\nsense that schedules are built incrementally by placing activities on the time line,\none at a time, and that the sequence in\nwhich activities are placed on the time\nline is not constrained by their order in\ntime. High-priority activities and those\nthat are time-constrained can be placed\non the time line first, even though they\nmay be scheduled to occur later than\nother low-priority activities.\nIn a nonchronological scheduling system, an activity is placed on a time line\nin roughly four steps: (1) Compute the\nintervals of time in which all of the\nrequirements and constraints that pertain to that activity are satiSfied, (2)\nSelect one of these intervals, (3) Align\nthe activity within the selected interval,\nand (4) Post reservations against the\nrequired resources during the chosen\ninterval. COMPASS employs a general\nalgorithm that computes the set of all\nsatisfying intervals. This enables the\nsystem , or the interactive user, to\nemploy sophisticated preference functions to choose the "best" interval and\nto align the activity at the "best" location\nin the chosen interval.\n\n70\n\nCOMPASS enables the user to build\nschedules, one activity at a time, or to\nbuild schedules by use of automated\nmethods. Once a schedule is created,\nthe user can move the activities around,\nchange resources or requirements, or\ncreate multiple schedules to reflect various scenarios. COMPASS ensures that\nconstraints are not violated while the\nuser manipulates the schedule. This\nenables the user to focus on the quality\nand overall look of the schedule while\nCOMPASS maintains the validity of the\nschedule.\nCOMPASS comes in two versions .\nThere is an ASCII-interface version, which\nrequires only a terminal capable of ASCII\ninput and output. Commands are entered\nin response to prompts and results are\ndisplayed as text. There is also a graphical version, which requires the appropriate windowing software for its graphical\ndisplay. Both versions provide the same\ncapabilities; however, the graphical version is intuitively easier to use.\nCOMPASS is written in Ada and C for\nSun4-series computers running SunOS\nv4 .1.3 and Solaris v2 .3 and is available\nas executable code only. The required\namount of random -access memory\nvaries with the size of the problem being\nsolved. This package of software includes sample executable codes that\nwere compiled under SunAda and C on\na Sparcstation running SunOS 5. Both X\nWindow and command-line executable\ncodes are included. The MIT X Window\nSystem, Version 11 Revision 4 or 5 is\nrequired for execution of the X Window\nversion of COMPASS. The standard distribution medium for COMPASS is a\n0.25-in. (6.35-mm) streaming-magnetictape cartridge (Sun QIC-24) in UNIX tar\nformat. Version 2.0 of COMPASS was\nreleased in 1994.\nThis program was written by Barry Fox\nof McDonnell Doug/as for Johnson\nSpace Center.

SELMON detects changes in the\nfrequency distributions of sensor readings\nover time; it also detects changes in relationships among sensor readings to detect\nanomalies (e.g., breaks in causal dependencies) that could be indicated by relationships among system parameters.\nThus, in comparison with older anomalydetecting software, SELMON provides a\nmore nearly complete anomaly-detection\ncapability, removing more of the anomalydetection burden from human operators.\nOnce an anomaly has been detected, SELMON determines how much of the monitored system has been affected; this kind\nof information can be critical in the first few\nmoments of an emergency, when several\nsensors reporting the same anomaly can\nconfuse an operator, with consequent\ndelayed response. SELMON is available in\nan Allegro CommonUsp and a C-Ianguage\nversion. Both versions run on Unix workstations. The Usp version runs on Sun\nSparcstations, and the C version runs on\nboth Sparcstations and DEC Alpha computers.

(2.5 mm) at a\nhorizontal distance of 30 ft (9.1 m). In the\noriginal application, the instrument is needed to assure noninterference among payloads that are about to be installed in the\nspace shuttle orbiter at precisely allocated\nvertical positions. The instrument could be\nreadily modified for similar industrial\nassembly applications in which large\n\nand/or heavy objects are initially horizontally distant from each other and are\nrequired to be at specified height relative to\neach other before bringing them together.\nThe instrument is made largely of highquality, commercially available opticallaboratory equipment. As shown in the\nfigure, the instrument includes a framework of two steel rods with aluminum\ninterface pieces at their ends. Magnetic\nbases bolted to the interface pieces are\n\nAluminum Interface\n\nRack-and-Pinion _ _\nMechanism\n\nRods, 0.5 in.

A rack-andpinion mechanism mounted on the\nframework provides for raising and lowering the optical assembly, with a total travel of 9 in. (23 cm). The relative height of\nthe optical assembly is read from a ruler\n(not shown in the figure) mounted on the\nframework adjacent to the rack-and-pinion mechanism.\nThe function of the optical assembly is\nto generate a well collimated, visible, horizontal laser beam that can be aimed at an\nobject of interest by rotating the laser in a\nhorizontal plane. The optical assembly\nincludes a battery-powered eye-safe\ndiode laser with a wavelength of 670 nm\nand an output power of 1 mW. The laser,\nits optics, and its battery are mounted on\na rotary table on a platform equipped with\na tilt adjustment for leveling the plane of\nrotation. A cross spirit level on top of the\nlaser housing provides guidance for the tilt\nadjustment.\nOnce the instrument has been attached\nmagnetically to a structure in the workspace, the rotary table is approximately\nleveled. The laser is switched on and is\naimed at a first target by a combination of\nrotary-table (horizontal) and rack-and-pinion (vertical) motions. The relative vertical\nheight of the first target is read from the\nruler. Then without changing the tilt adjustment, the laser beam is aimed at a second\ntarget by a similar combination of motions,\nand the relative height of the second target\nis read from the ruler. Then the difference\nbetween the heights of the two targets is\ncalculated by subtracting one reading from\nthe other.\nThis work was done by Arne E. Aamodt\nand Ivan F.

This conduit clamp is similar to a commercial single-piece cast\nplastic conduit clamp, the flexing points\nof which fail over time, and which cannot\nbe disengaged without a too/.\nThe conduit clamp includes clamping\nfingers with compound curvatures and\nvaried lengths and thicknesses. The purpose and overall effect of these curvatures\nand variations in length and thickness are\nto ensure that the fingers fit snugly to the\nconduit and that the various faying surfaces come together and apart in the\nproper engagement and disengagement\nsequences.\nThe figure illustrates a disengagement\nsequence. The latch handle is pressed to\nrelease the ratchet teeth: this allows the\nfingers of the clamp to open. As the technician or robot pulls the conduit out,\nsprings push the clamping fingers outward\nto provide a clear path for the conduit.\nTo install a conduit, the conduit is\ngripped away from the clamp and insert-\n\nENGAGED\n\nRATCHET TEETH RELEASED\n\nCONDUIT PULLED OUT\n\nThe Conduit Clamp can be opened or closed easily, without special tools or training without looking.\n\ned in the opening between the outwardly\nsprung clamping fingers. As the conduit is\npushed in, the fingers close into a softdocking configuration in which the ratchet teeth become engaged in the looser of\ntwo ratchet positions. Further on, the\nconduit adjacent to the clamp causes the\nfingers to flex in such a way that the\n\neven\n\nratchet teeth become engaged in the\ntighter of the two ratchet poSitions.\nThis work was done by Clint A.

LEW-15618\n\nDocking Station and Replaceable Equipment Module\nThe module can be replaced by a technician or by a robot.\n\nLewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe figure illustrates an equipment\nmodule and a docking station that\nreceives the module. The module and station are designed together with alignment\nfeatures, coupling/uncoupling mechanisms and circuits, and a thermal interface. The integrated design accelerates\nand facilitates installation of the module in,\nor removal of the module from, the station\nby a technician or by a robot.\nThe thermal interface between the\nmodule and the station consists of two\npanels with mating parallel ridges and valleys. Heat from electronic or other eqUipment in the module is conducted across\nthe ridged interface and carried away by a\nliquid coolant flowing in channels under\nthe ridges on the station side. The mating\nridges and valley surfaces also help to\nalign the module with the station: Once\nthe module and station are brought into\ninitial alignment by pressing them together at these surfaces, the module is slid\n\n74\n\nalong these surfaces until spring-loaded\nalignment pins at the corners of the module fall into mating detent alignment holes\nin the station.\nOnce alignment is complete, the module is clamped to the station by use of two\nmovable clamping wedges in the station\nthat are pushed outward against mating\nfixed clamping wedges mounted in the\nmodule on opposite sides. The clamping\nwedges are attached to ball nuts that slide\non linear bearings; they are driven by a ball\nscrew that is, in turn, driven via miter\ngears by a pair of redundant dc motors.\nThe motors are controlled and powered\nby compactly packaged external control\nand power circuits carried by the technician or robot. In the event of a failure in the\npower and/or control circuitry, the ball\nscrew can be turned manually by use of a\nwrench inserted in a square drive socket\nat either end of the ball-screw shaft.\nConnections with these external circuits\n\nare made via a multiple-pin plug that is\ninserted in a socket on the top of the\nmodule. The signals and power are carried from this socket to a specially\ndesigned multiple-contact-button electrical connector on the lower side of the\nmodule that mates with a speciallydesigned multiple-contact -button electrical connector in the station: the special\ndesign is such that the multiple-contactbutton connectors do not prevent the sliding motion needed to effect alignment,\nand so that electrical contact between\nthem is made via spring-detent action of\nmating convex and concave contact surfaces once alignment is complete.\nA voltage proportional to the motor current is sent back to the external control\ncircuitry. To a reasonable approximation,\nthe motor current is proportional to the\ntorque applied by the motor(s) and, thus,\nis proportional to the force of clamping\nbetween the two modules.

Depending on the specific\ngear-tooth specifications and other\ndesign parameters, this gearbox could be\nmade to provide any speed-reduction\nratio from about 40 to infinity, without\nneed for additional stages of gearing. The\ntorque-to-weight ratio, output stiffness,\nand efficiency of this gearbox could be\ncomparable to those of a harmonic drive.\nHarmonic drives are typically limited to\nspeed-reduction ratios ~ 320.\nThe gearbox would include an input\nhousing that surrounds an input shaft,\nand an output housing that could rotate\non bearings with respect to the input\nhousing about an axis perpendicular to\nthat of the input shaft (see figure). The\noutput housing would be the output\ndrive member; that is, the overall function of the gearbox would be to make\nthe output housing rotate slowly, with\nhigh torque capacity, relative to the\ninput housing , about an axis perpendicular to that of the input shaft. The input\nshaft could be turned by a motor or\n\n78\n\nother actuator mounted coaxially in the\ninput housing.\nThe gearbox would contain an outer\nand an inner differential. These differential\nmechanisms would be similar to those on\nthe rear axles of most automobiles, but\nwould contain gears cut with numbers of\nteeth somewhat different from those ordinarily used. The input shaft would tum spider gear B of the outer differential, thereby\ncausing bevel gears A and B of the outer\ndifferential to rotate in opposite directions\nabout the tube in the output housing.\nBevel gears A and B would have the\nsame pitch diameter, but may have a\nslight variation in the number of teeth,\nthus causing them to rotate at different\nvelocities. The load would also be shared\nby spider gear A of the outer differential,\nwhich would rotate as an idler between\nbevel gears A and B of the outer differential. Each bevel gear of the inner differential\nwould rotate with, and thus be driven by,\nthe corresponding bevel gear of the outer\ndifferential. As in the outer differential,\nthese bevel gears may also vary in number\nof teeth. In tum, the bevel gears of the\ninner differential would drive the spider\ngears; because the spider shafts would be\n\nrigidly attached to the tube in the outer\nhousing, this action would cause the outer\nhousing to tum about the output axis by\nan amount that would depend on the\nnumbers of teeth in the various gears.\nBecause torque would be transmitted\nsimultaneously through multiple gear\nteeth on large pitch diameters, the torque\ncapacity of this gearbox would be very\nhigh in comparison with that of gearboxes of the same size and weight but older\ndesign. This same feature would impart\nvery high output stiffness. Yet another\nadvantage is that backlash could be\nreduced or eliminated in two ways: (1)\nBecause the total number of gears would\nbe kept small , even for high gear ratios,\nthere would be fewer than the usual number of locations where backlash could\nenter. (2) The sandwich configuration of\nthe differentials would make it possible to\npreload the differentials by incorporating\nsprings to press the two sets of bevel\ngears inward against the spider gears.\nThis work was done by Timothy R.\nOhm of Ca/tech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The company, a\njoint ventute ofMelies Griot Inc., Irvine, CA,\nand Hitachi Metals Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, introduced its first product at the Conference on\nLasers and Electro-Optics (CLEO) in\nAnaheim in June. The Model ICD-430 (see\n"New Products") is a DPSS laser emitting a\n10-mW single-spatial-mode blue beam that\nthe company says is useful for reprographics,\ncompact-disk manufacturing, and medical\ninstrumentation. Melles Griot designs, manufactures, and distributes a wide variety of photonics products worldwide. Hitachi Metals, a\nleading manufacturer of specialty steels, automotive components, and magnetic and electronic materials, also develops new electronic\nand laser devices.\nThe Light Brigade, the supplier of fiber\noptic design, installation, and maintenance\ntraining, has moved to new and larger facilities. The new address is 7691 S. 180th St.,\n\nBell Laboratories researchers have demonstrated the world\'s first room-temperature\nand high-temperature semiconductor lasers\nthat operate in the mid- and long-wavelength\ninfrared regions. Quantum-cascade (QC)\nlasers, invented at Bell Labs\' Murray Hill, NJ,\nsite in 1994, initially operated at temperatures\nlower than -300 OF; the new lasers, at 5\nmicrons, provide a pulsed peak power of\nabout 200 mW at 77 OF and about 100 mW\nat 127 oF.\nFederico Capasso, head of the quantum\nphenomena and device research department\nat Bell Labs (now the R&D arm of Lucent\nTechnologies), says that the spectral ranges of\nthe new lasers-3-5 f1II1 and 8-13 pm-will\nbe useful in pollution monitoring and industrial process control for environmentally safe\nmanufacturing, because many hazardous and\ntoxic chemicals have optical absorption "fingerprints" at these wavelengths. Among other\nuses foreseen are the detection of water and\npollutants in the gases employed in semiconductor processing.\nThe Bell Labs team says the QC laser is the\nworld\'s first whose emission wavelength can\nbe tailored over a wide range in the infrared\nby varying the thickness of the material layers.\n\nThey have demonstrated wavelengths ranging\nfrom 4 to 11 microns.\nThe Defense Sciences Office of the\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n(DARPA) awarded Bell Labs a rwo-year grant\nto develop continuous-wave QC lasers that\ncan be cooled by thermoelectric coolers, i.~.,\nabove -75 oc. Thermoelectric coolers typically COSt no more than a few hundred dollars,\nwhile cryogenic coolers cost about $10,000.\nPersonnel of the Air Force Phillips\nLaboratory\'s Airborne Laser Technology\nDivision registered the first successful use of a\nlaser beam to illuminate and track a theater\nmissile in its boost phase on June 3 at the\nArmy\'s High Energy Laser System Test\nFacility, White Sands Missile Range, NM.\nThe test, which involved a missile travelling at\nabout one kilometer per second, was repeated\nsuccessfully on June 16.\nThe researchers, a joint team from the Air\nForce, Army, Navy, Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology\'s Lincoln Laboratory, Hughes\nAircrm, and Aerotherm Corp., initiated the\ntest by locking the tracker onto the missile\'s\nbright exhaust plume. About 15 seconds and\n23 kilometers into the launch, the laser was\nswitched on to illuminate the missile\'s body.\nTechnicians then used the reflected laser light\nto focus the tracker on the body, and the laser\ntracked it out to about 50 kilometers.\n\nQuick Quotations &Expedited Delivery on your\nSilicon &Germanium optical materials.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCustom Prototypes\nHigh Volume Production\nStandard Fabrication SeNices\n\nTo see how Lattice can\nwork for you, fax us at:\n\n406/587-9055\n\n~~LAlTICE\n=\n\nFrom crystal growth to finished bIonks\n\n51 East Tamarack\n6\nBozeman, MT 59715\n\n406/586-2122\n\nFor More InfomultJon Write In No. 452\n\nit\'s not\nbroken, why break it.\n-~F~ PRODUCTS and LAB SERVICES\n10737 Lexington Drive, Knoxville, TN 37932\n\n~~~\n\n423-966-5856\n\nfax:\n\n423-675- 1241\n\nFor More Information Writ.

The great distance of the planet from Earth (30-50 AU)\nand budgetary constraints ruled out the\nuse of any but the smallest reconnaissance spacecraft with currently available\nlaunch vehicles. In 1993 a NASA Research Announcement invited innovative\ndesigns to meet the objectives of the\napproximately 9-year-long mission to\nPluto. Mission science requirements\ncalled for two spectrometers and two\nvisible-light cameras in an instrument\nweighing less than 7 kg and consuming\nless than 6 W of power.\nSince no previous instrument met the\ndesign constraints, or even came close,\nthe JPL approach from the outset concentrated on three elements to reach the\nneeded goals: system architecture,\ndetector sensitivity and noise, and materials. The team strove first to maximize\nthe commonality between the different\nchannels of the unit. Thus, all of them use\nthe same primary collecting mirror element, the heaviest mirror in the system.\nFor detectors that require cooling, the\nheat radiator and the detector assembly\nform an integrated mechanical subassembly, so designed that the critical\ncomponents will all run at their optimum\ntemperatures. By sharing the set of foreoptics and a miniaturized, low-power set\nof electronics to drive the signal chain of\nall three PICS focal planes, the sensor\nsystem comes in weighing 5 kg, requiring 1.5 W of power, and fitting within a\ntotal volume of 30 X 30 X 40 cm.\nAnother pivotal issue considered very\nearly in the design was the need to develop a self-sequencing instrument. That is,\nit would incorporate an integrated science data-gathering timeline in which\nthe UV and IR spectrometers and the visible cameras would operate in complementary fashion to accumulate data as\nthe spacecraft approaches and then\npasses Pluto and its satellite Charon.\nAccording to Gregg Vane, PICS Program\nManager at JPL, earlier planetary mis4a\n\nsions such as Voyager were plagued with\nsequencing difficulties. Voyager, which required four optical sensors and a sophisticated scan platform to perform functions\nequivalent to those of PICS, en-countered\nsuch problems because all of those\ninvolved in the design "wanted to take\ndata at the closest point of approach.\'\n\nSequenced Data-Gathering\nPICS\'s data, by contrast, will be\nacquired sequentially by the separate\nfocal planes at times appropriate to provide correct spatial coverage in the\nrespective channels. The integrated sensor system, configured as a long-focallength instrument, enables data gathering from far out. Because the spatial resolution required for UV data is coarsest, it\nwill be taken farthest from the target. The\nhighest-resolution visible-image data will\n\nfrom about 280K on Earth to 40-60K at\nPluto. Thus the materials must be highly\ndimensionally stable, chemically nonreactive, and with good structural capabilities and manufacturability.\nThe result of this set of constraints was\nthe decision to make the entire instrument, optical and structural, of silicon\ncarbide (SiC). This in turn led to a new\napproach to the instrument\'s subsequent development. The JPL designers\nspent considerable effort in selecting\nindustrial "teaming partners" to carry out\nthe design to take advantage of SiC\'s\nstrengths and to meet the other project\nconstraints. "We don\'t think of anyone\nwe worked with as vendors," Vane said.\n"This was truly a joint design effort. The\nrevolution has really taken place." The\nPICS structural configuration was developed in collaboration with SSG Inc. of\n\nIRRADIATOR\n\n30\n\nIR\nSPECTROMETER\nASSEMBLY\n\nSchematic of the Planetary Integrated Camera-Spectrometer. APS = active pixel\nsensor arrays.\n\nbe taken closest to the planet, and the\nintermediate-resolution IR in between.\nA further advantage is that this design\nfeature eliminates the need for a scan\nplatform, again reducing weight and\npower requirements. By contrast, Voyager\'s four-instrument optical remote\nsensing package, including its scan platform, weighed 200 kg, consumed some\n75 W of power, and filled a total volume\nof close to a meter in both diameter and\nheight. PICS is also expected to cost less\nthan $20 million, whereas the Voyager\nequipment was more than $100 million.\nThe team\'s solution to the complex\nmaterials issue turned out to be simple.\nIn addition to the question of mass, the\ninstrument had to have long-term tolerance of a wide range of temperatures,\n\nWaltham, MA. Others in the integrated\nteam were Rockwell Science Center (the\nIR focal plane arrays). the University of\nArizona (UV spectrometer). and the U.S.\nGeological Survey, which is the home\ninstitution of the PICS principal investigator, Dr. Laurence Soderblom.\nAll of PICS\'s data-gathering systems\nshare a single off-axis Gregorian telescope. Both primary and secondary mirrors are off-axis sections of rotationally\nsymmetric aspheres, enabling them to\nbe fabricated by diamond turning with\npost-polishing. In the UV spectrometer\nchannel. the primary mirror focuses the\nlight directly through an entrance slit,\nand an aberration-corrected concave\ndiffraction grating sends it to the UV\ndetector.\nAugust 1996\n\nThe other instruments share the secondary mirror, an aluminum-coated concave mirror that picks up the fields reflected from a fold mirror. Another fold mirror\ndirects the light to the focal plane assemblies of the two CCD cameras. A dichroic\nbeamsplitter cube splits the light for the\ntwo. Diffraction-limited performance is\nachieved over both CCD fields of view.\nMaking the infrared imaging spectrometer slit off-axis from the CCD fields\nenabled the designers to use a small\nprism bonded to the dichroic cube to\nsplit off the light for it. The IR spectrometer had to be small enough to be cooled\nas part of the cold focal plane assembly\nto minimize thermal background. The\nteam chose a design from the CzernyTurner family with an overall focal length\nof just 7 cm. The field curvature was\ncompensated for by an off-axis segment\nof a spherical field-flattening lens. The IR\nspectrometer also uses a plane grating\nwith 110 grooves/mm.\nThe UV spectrometer uses a toroidal\ngrating with 1400 grooves/mm that\nfocuses the light onto an intensified CCD\ndetector of the same type as that in the\nvisible channel, to simplify data acquisition and control electronics. The grating\nis holographic to minimize stray light, and\nproduces a flat image plane on the\ndetector, which is a single microchannel\nplate coupled to a phosphor output.\nAnother aspect of commonality is that\nthe electronics are integrated: that is, one\nsignal chain serves all of the PICS\'s\nchannels. State-of-the-art electronics\npackaging such as hybrids and gate\narrays help to minimize mass and size.\n\nFocal Plane Demands\nThe science requirements of the mission imposed some difficult demands\non the design of the IR focal plane.\nAmong them are a need for a very high\nsignal-to-noise ratio of greater than 100\nin all spectral channels; high spatial and\nspectral resolution, requiring at least a\n256-X-256-pixel staring focal plane; radiation hardness, especially against the\nspacecraft\'s own plutonium-powered\nRTG power units; and modestly low operating temperature achievable with radiative cooling, obviating the deployment of\nactive coolers.\nA further consideration was to base\nthe design on proven IR focal plane array\ntechnology. If none could be found to\nmeet all of PICS\'s requirements, then the\ngoal was to adopt an existing design and\nmake as few modifications as possible to\nfulfill the design objectives. The PICS\nfocal-plane readout thus represents an\nevolutionary advancement on the suc\'cessful Near Infrared Camera and MultiObject Spectrograph (NICMOS-3) readAugustl996\n\nout developed by the Rockwell Science\nCenter of Thousand Oaks, CA.

The light scattered by particles passing through the two beams exhibits a\nslight difference in the Doppler-shifted frequency. This frequency difference, which\nis proportional to the particle velocity perpendicular to the optical axis in the plane\nof the beams, is detected as an intensity\nmodulation of the scattered light in isolated "bursts" of light generated by particles\npassing through the measurement volume. Accordingly, the scattered light is\ncontinuously monitored, and the frequency content of these "Doppler bursts" is\nanalyzed to determine particle speed.\nThe top part of the figure illustrates a\nlaser Doppler anemometer of typical\n\nCollimating\nLens\n\nolder design, assembled from separate\ncomponents.

These devices\noffer the potential for contactless, precise actuation with tetherless control.\nThey could prove useful in miniature\nwalking, vibrating , or gripping mechanisms that could be used, for example,\nto power miniature motors, explore terrain, inspect narrow crevices, or hold tissues during microsurgical procedures.\nConventional, voltage-energized bimorphs contain relatively thick wafers of\nbulk piezoelectric materials.

Work is under\nway to decrease tail response time. The\nrise time is 20 ns. The measured response of the array decays approximately 3 orders of magnitude in 60 ns. The rise\ntime of the pixel is on the order of 5 ns.\nThe effective pixel size was measured\nby scanning a very small laser spot (0.25\nmm) across the pixel under test.

This modification overcomes some of the limitations of prior\nlaser velocimeters used to measure\ncrossflows near a wall. These limitations\ninclude low signal-to-noise ratios, insufficient sensitivity to the crossflow velocity, and spurious signals from particles\noutside the intended small measurement\nvolume in simultaneous multivelocity\ncomponent measurement applications.\nThe laser beams enter the wind tunnel\napproximately perpendicularly to the\nwall. The probe can be introduced\nthrough the same or the opposite wall.\nThe mirror on the probe turns the laser\nbeams through a right angle to grazing\nincidence on the wall or on a plane near\nand parallel to the wall. The probe is\nmounted to move with the other laser\nvelocimeter equipment in scanning the\nmeasurement region. Alternatively, the\nlaser beams might be introduced\nthrough a fiber-optic head on the probe\n(see figure on next page).\nThe use of the mirror probe involves\nthree major disadvantages, but it offers\nseveral advantages in return. The first\ndisadvantage is that with the introduction of the probe, the technique is no\nAugust 1996\n\nlonger noninvasive. The second disadvantage is that one has to measure\nlight scattered from the measurement\nvolume perpendicularly to the optical\naxis, and this light is considerably less\nthan is light scattered forward (along\nthe optical axis). The third disadvantage is that to minimize spurious scattering of light by the wall and to enable\nmeasurements of perpendicularly scattered light, the wall in the measurement\nregion has to be made transparent and\noptically smooth.\nOne of the advantages is that the perpendicular scattering provides for shorter sensing volumes (consequently, higher spatial resolution) and, perhaps, better isolation of the velocimetric photodectector from background light. One\nvery important advantage is that the\ncrossflow velocity can be measured directly at a grazing incidence, which\nallows for better spatial resolution normal to the wall and reduced background\nlight. Another advantage is that the\ntransmitting and receiving lenses can\nbe placed close to the measurement region: this facilitates the use of a small\nmeasurement volume, and because the\nsolid angle subtended by the receiving\nlens is relatively large, this lens can collect a relatively large amount of scattered light to provide a higher signal-to-\n\nc\n\nN\n\nOptiCS and Coatings\n\nActon Research Corporation\n\niThe new OptiCS & Coatings\ncatalog Includes all of\n~RC\'s standard optical\ncomponen and coatings,\nIncluding:\n\n- Laser OptIcs for All\n\nExclrner a U Harmonics\n\n-OptIcal Filters: 122-1064nm\n- UV BeamspUtt rs\n-VUV-UV Wlndo s & Lenses\n-UV Enhanced Aluminum\nMirrors and Coatings\n\n- New\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 W Broad nd\nAntIreflection Coatings\nand VUV Reftecttv Filters\n\nPO Box 2215\nActon, MA 01720\nTel: 508-263-3584\nFax: 508-263-5086\nhHp:llwww.acton-research.com\nFor More Information Write In No. 460\n\nnoise ratio.

However, unlike in the older\ninstruments, the reference species need not be the species\nof interest, and need not reside in the reference cell; these\nare important advantages when the species of interest is\ntransient or unstable (e.g., a radical), too corrosive to be contained in a reference cell, or a stable species in an excited\nstate that cannot be maintained in sufficient concentration in\na reference cell.\nThese advantages are afforded by an off-line-locking\nscheme, in which the wavelength is locked to a reference spectral line at a known wavelength that differs from the wavelength\nof the spectral line of interest by a known amount. This scheme\ninvolves operation of the tunable laser diode in alternation\nbetween two wavelengths: First. the laser diode is locked to\nthe reference spectral line during a short tuning period. Next,\nthe line lock is temporarily disabled and the wavelength is\nabruptly shifted by the known wavelength difference to the\nabsorption line of interest and held there during a short absorption-measurement period. The wavelength is then abruptly\nshifted back to the reference spectral line, the line lock is\nrestored, and the cycle is repeated.\nThe abrupt shifts in wavelength and the rapid reference-linelocking adjustments of wavelength are effected by changing\nthe laser-diode drive current according to the known dependence of the laser wavelength on the drive current as determined previously in calibration measurements. As part of an initial coarse setting of wavelength near the reference line, the\ncurrent is initially set at a nominal value according to this known\ndependence. In addition, the temperature of the diode is maintained at a steady value, in coordination with the Initial current\nsetting, according to the known dependence of wavelength on\ntemperature for a given drive current. The wavelength-vs.-temperature and wavelength-vs.-current information are contained\nin the memory of the microprocessor.\nThe beam from the laser diode strikes the beam splitter,\nwhich diverts a small part of the beam power through the reference cell. The rest of the beam power travels to the measurement region, which can be either an open region or a space\ninside a sensor head. After passing through the measurement\nregion, the beam is received by photodetector 1, the output of\nwhich is fed to phase-sensitive detectors (PSD1, PSD2, and\nPSD3) in the control and measurement circuitry.\nDepending on the chosen mode of operation, PSD1 puts out\na signal proportional to either (a) the dc component of the output of photodetector 1 or (b) the first harmonic of the time-varying component of the electrical output of photodetector 1. The\ndc or first-harmonic signal provides an indication of the intensity of the laser beam in the measurement region. The output of\nPSD2 is the second harmonic (or a higher even harmonic),\nwhich provides an Indication of absorption by the species of\ninterest. The microprocessor divides the second-harmonic signal by the first-harmonic signal to obtain a normalized absorption signal that is independent of variations in the intensity of\nthe laser beam or of partial obscuration of the optics by dirt.\nIf the reference species is located in the measurement\nregion, then the off-line-locking scheme utilizes the output\nof photodetector 1. If the reference species is located in the\nreference cell, then the scheme utilizes the output of photodetector 2, which receives the small portion of the laser\nbeam that has passed through the reference cell . In either\ncase, the applicable photodetector output is fed to PSD3,\nwhich puts out a signal proportional to the third harmonic\n(or a higher odd harmonic). This signal constitutes an error\nsignal, which is zero when the laser wavelength equals the\nreference wavelength. This error signal is supplied to the\nline-lock circuit, which generates a frequency-correction\nAugust 1996\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCapacities from 1kW to 1OOkW\nCompact & Portable\nRefrigerated & Non-Refrigerated\nCustom Configurations\nAlways CFC-Free\n\n~ffinit~\n603/539-3600.

This\ninstrument was originally developed at\nBrookhaven as part of a program funded\nby the US Dept. of Energy Office of Basic\nEnergy Sciences in collaboration with\nLawrence Berkeley Laboratory. A cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) was established with\nContinental Optical Corp. to meet the\ndemand from laboratories and institutions around the world for instrumentation to measure grazing-incidence mirrors, and to develop new applications\nfor the instrument.\nContinental Optical is developing an\nin-situ LTP (ISLTP) to be used to measure the shape and distortion of mirrors\nsubjected to extremely high heat loads\nin the ultrahigh-vacuum environment of\nSR storage rings , and a vertical-scan\nLTP (VSLTP) to measure the threedimensional shape of large x-ray telescope components.\nThe LTP is designed to measure the\nfigure of large aspheric mirrors used to\nreflect x-rays at extreme grazing incidence angles. Mirrors used in grazingincidence SR beamlines are often\nshaped like segments of cylinders or\ntoroids, or far-off-axis conic sections\nsuch as paraboloids and ellipsoids .\nThese mirrors are difficult to manufacture, since they require unconventional\ngrinding and polishing techniques, and\nthey are extremely difficu lt to measure by\nconventional optical testing techniques.\nThe LTP uses a noncontact optical\nprobe mounted on a precision air bearing\nslide to scan down the length of the optical surface. The probe consists of a collimated laser beam split into two collinear\nbeams separated by a distance of one\nmillimeter. They are reflected off the test\nsurface during the scan and are recom bined and brought to a focus onto a linear-array detector. The position of the\n16a\n\ninterference fringe on the detector\nrecords the local slope of the surface\nunder test, and the height profile of the\nsurface is computed by integrating the\nslope values. The intrinsic noise level of\nthe system is less than 0.5 microradian\nper point, which permits measurement of\nslope errors in the range of 0.1 arc second with high precision and accuracy.\nThe instrument is optimized to measure\nerrors on the meter-long optics used in\nSR beamlines and for x-ray telescopes.\nThe ISLTP is being developed in collaboration with the Advanced Photon\nSource at Argonne National Laboratory\nand Sincrotrone Trieste in Italy.

The system is designed to measure both the exterior surface of highly\npolished mandrels and the interior surface of replicated telescope cylinders.\nThe vertical configuration minimizes the\neffects of gravity distortion on the measurement and permits accurate measurement of the true surface shape.

As\nin the previous apparatus, the feedback\nloop for radio-frequency oscillation in\nthis apparatus includes a fiber-optic\ndelay line coupled to a photodetector, an\namplifier, and a radio-frequency bandpass filter, the output of which is applied\nto an input terminal of the electro-optical\nmodulator.

The instantaneous beat frequency of the laser beams must be\nmeasured because it must be subtracted from the corresponding beat frequency in the probe output signal to\nobtain the Doppler shift and, thus, the\nflow velocity that one seeks to measure.\nA laser anemometer of the type in\nquestion is used in aerodynamic experiments. To reduce the size and complexity of the probe head, all laser-beam\nconditioning and electronic processing\nof signals are performed outside the\naerodynamic test chamber. Optical\nfibers are used to transmit the input\nlaser beams to the probe head, and to\ntransmit the output beams from the\nprobe head to the signal-processing circuits. Although the laser beams are\ngenerated with a preset beat frequency\n(usually 40 MHz), there is no assurance\nthat the input laser beams are launched\nfrom the probe head into the flow with\nthis same beat frequency; this is\n\nbecause vibrations of the probe head\ngenerate stress waves in the fibers,\nmodulating the input laser beams in\nsuch a way as to cause random frequency shifts, thus giving rise to large\nuncertainties in instantaneous measured velocities.\nThus, it is necessary to measure the\ninput-beam beat frequency in the probe\nhead to obtain the actual value as\naltered by vibrations. In the method that\nwas developed for this purpose, a prism\nmounted in the probe head extracts 1\npercent of the power of each input laser\nbeam and sends both 1-percent sample beams to a nonlinear detector. The\noutput of the detector includes a component at the beat frequency, which is\nthe preset beat frequency (e.g., 40\nMHz) plus or minus any instantaneous\nfrequency shift caused by vibrations.\nThis work was done by Dariush\nModarress and Thomas Hoeft of\nPhysical Research, Inc., and David F.\nSchaack,\nconsultant,\nfor Lewis\nResearch Center.

The purpose was to develop an\nalternative to the traditional strain-gage\nmethod commonly used to make stress\n\nmeasurements on gas-tUrbine engine\nrotor blades during simulated altitude\ntesting of aircraft engines.\nBefore NSMS was developed, engineers would attach strain gages directly\nto the blade surfaces with their signals\nexiting the engine through Slip rings or by\n\nROTOR STAGE\n\nSHAFT\n\nBLADE-TIP SENSOR (S)\n\nBLADE-VIBRATION AND\nSTRESS INFORMATION\n\nFigure 1.

These surface-mounted\ngages and the associated wiring would\noften interfere with the aerodynamic performance of the engine. Also, whether\nthey lasted hours or failed within a matter\nof seconds, these traditional gages had a\nvery limited life span because of the\nengine\'s extremely high temperatures.\nWhen the gages failed, replacing them\nwas very expensive, because engineers\nwould have to disassemble the engine to\ninstall new gages.\nNSMS uses light probes to detect\npassing events on blade tips (Rg. 1).\nEngineers mount the probes (Fig. 2)\nthrough the engine\'s casing along the\nblade\'s rotation path.

As a blade passes, a\nportion of the light is reflected back\nthrough the lens into a receiving fiber\noptic photodetector. By timing and processing these events, engineers can\ndetermine blade-tip vibratory deflections.\nFrom one to four light probes are used\nfor each rotor stage, depending on the\nmeasurement requirements. One probe\ncan measure vibration amplitudes; two\nprobes allow vibration phase and frequency to be determined. Four probes\nare needed to detect vibration frequencies that are integer multiples of the rotor\nspeed. Probe separation angles around\nthe case\'s circumference are determined\nby the blade\'s vibration frequency range\nor by the bladed-disk system-mode\nvibration pattern.\nThe AEDC NSMS can provide monitoring of selected or all blade rows simultaneously. Unprocessed digital data are\ncontinuously stored on optical disk.\nProcessed data can be displayed in a\nvariety of formats, including Campbell\ndiagrams, FFTs, modal analyses, and\nvibrational amplitude presentations.\nStress conversions are possible where\nthe deflection-to-stress transfer functions\nhave been entered into the database.\nThe advantages of using the NSMS to\nsupport engine testing are improved sensor reliability, increased measurement\ncoverage to all blades in the instrument\nrow, improved measurements in the hot\nsections of the engine, and minimized\nrepair due to failed sensors. Potential\nadditional applications of the NSMS\ntechnique are routine health monitoring\nof aircraft engines in flight and the monitOring of industrial machinery with rotorblade assemblies.\nNonintrusive measurements of rotor\nblade vibrations using light probes are\ncurrently being applied and improved by\nmajor US engine manufacturers.

The fixture was\noriginally designed to chase existing\nairframe holes on an F-18 spin-chuterecovery system, but has since been\nadapted to a variety of uses in which\nthere is a need for a fixture that can be\neasily aligned and locked at any desired\nangle.\nThe fixture (see figure) includes a\nmounting plate, a two-piece locking\nplate, locking bolts, a ball swivel. and\nbushings. The mounting plate and the\nlocking plate can be made of aluminum\nor any other suitable material. The ball\nswivel and bushings are preferably\nmade of steel, and the bushings should\nbe hardened, if possible. Protruding\nfrom the swivel ball is a shank that has\nbeen turned to a diameter large enough\nand cut to a length long enough to pro-\n\nvide a stable bushing guide. The swivel\nand shank are bored along the centerline of the shank to accept the required\nbushings.\nThe mounting plate is configured with\nbolt holes and/or any other convenient\nfeatures for attachment to a workpiece\nat a desired location. The top surface of\nthe mounting plate is drilled and tapped\nto accept the locking bolts. The two\npieces of the locking plate are top and\nbottom mating halves, each half milled\nwith a female hemisphere having a 3/4in. (19-mm) diameter matching the\ndiameter of the swivel ball. The hemispheres are purposely cut 0.010 in.\n(0.25 mm) less than full depth to enable\nthem to clamp the swivel ball tightly.\nThe pieces of the locking plate are\nbrought together with the ball resting in\nthe hemispheres, and the locking bolts\nare threaded into the mounting plate.\nPrior to tightening the locking bolts, the\nlocking plates can be moved laterally to\n\nalign the swivel fixture at the desired\nposition. To enable such lateral movements, slots that accommodate the\nlocking bolts with sufficient lateral clearance are milled into the two pieces of\nthe locking plate. Once the swivel is\naligned at the desired position and\nangle, the bolts are tightened to capture the swivel securely in that alignment.\nIn preparation for chasing a hole that\nwas made previously, one first selects a\npilot shaft with a diameter equal to that\nof the hole, then passes the shaft\nthrough a bushing into the hole. Then\none tightens the locking screws. The\nball swivel is now fixed in place, concentric to the hole, and the hole can be\nmodified as required.\nThis work was done by Thomas W.\nMcMullen of Dryden Flight Research\nCenter.

In the conventional tech-\n\nnique for making such a grid (shown on\nthe left side of the figure), grid wires are\ncut to length and threaded through\nholes or slots on opposite sides of a\nmachined frame. The holes or slots\n\nestablish the\nthen held in\nspring. This\ntechnique is\nsuming.\n\ngrid spacing.

In contrast, the conventional\ntechnique involves cutting, inserting, and mounting multiple grid wires.\n\nIn the improved technique (illustrated\non the right side of the figure), two opposite sides of the frame consist of pairs of\nidentical threaded rods that support the\ngrid wires in tension. The pitch of the\nthreads on the rods establishes the grid\nspacing; the grid spacing can be any\ninteger multiple of the thread pitch. If a\nstandard thread pitch and diameter are\nnot acceptable in a given application,\nthen a nonstandard thread can be cut on\na rod by use of a lathe.\nWhat is new in this technique is (1) the\nspecific arrangement of the four threaded\n\nrods in two pairs on opposite sides of the\ngrid frame, (2) taking advantage of this\narrangement to facilitate the placement\nof the grid wire on the frame, and (3) the\ncontinuous winding of a grid wire using\nwire dispensed from a spool rather than\nprecut wires. In this technique, it is not\nnecessary to cut, insert, and mount multiple grid wires as in the conventional\ntechnique. Instead, one continuous grid\nwire is simply unrolled from a spool and\nwound onto the threaded rods. Starting\nfrom the left side, the spool is passed\naround rod 1, over rods 2 and 3 in the\n\nfirst thread-pitch interval, and around rod\n4. Then going back toward the left side,\nthe spool is passed over rods 3 and 2 in\nthe second thread-pitch interval.

Instead, the\nampoule is mounted in a fixed position in\nthe central hollow of an annular heat pipe\nin which the thermal gradient is main-\n\ntained with the help of a noncondensible\ngas that is deliberately put into the heat\npipe along with the working fluid: the\ngradient forms at the boundary between\nthe working-fluid vapor and the noncondensible gas, which collects in the heatpipe condenser. The temperature gradient is made to translate along the heat\n\npipe by feeding in additional noncondensible gas at a low rate. Because there\nare no moving mechanical parts, this\ndesign offers the advantages of simplicity, ruggedness, and very little vibration\n(vibration is undesirable because it can\ndisturb the crystal-growth process).\nThis work was done by Donald Gillies\n\nTHE PERFORMANCE OF APR\'s\nPARALLEL PROCESSING\nSOLUTION IS SO QUICK,\nYOU WON\'T EVEN SLOW DOWN.\n\nand Sandor L.

The process includes laser scanning of casts\ntaken from hands, computer-aided design (CAD), computercontrolled generation of two-dimensional patterns from threedimensional surfaces, rapid prototyping by stereolithography,\nand laser cutting of materials.\nThe process is intended to replace a time-consuming manual process for making custom-fitted gloves. In initial tests, the\ndevelopmental automated process took about as much time\nand cost about as much as the manual process did, but reductions in manufacturing time and cost are anticipated as experience is gained and ways to realize the full potential of automation are found. The fit and comfort of gloves manufactured in\nthe automated process are at least as good as, and often better than, those of gloves manufactured in the manual process .\nThese observations suggest that the automated process could\nalso be useful in the manufacture of other special-purpose or\ncustom-fitted items of clothing.\nAs in the manual process, the developmental automated\nprocess begins with making a model hand from a mold cast from\nthe hand. Then the model hand is scanned by a laser profilometer to obtain data on the size and shape of the hand. Scanning\nof models rather than direct scanning of hands was selected to\neliminate errors caused by hand motions and to ensure that fine\nfeatures like bumps are measured accurately. Models offer an\nadditional important advantage in that they serve as permanent\nrecords of the sizes and shapes of hands to be fitted.\nThe data acquired in the scan are provided to a CAD program, which generates a mathematical wire model of the glove.\nSurface-design software in the CAD program then generates a\nmathematical surface model by interpolating and extrapolating\nfrom the wire model and incorporating features that promote\ncomfort and freedom of movement and facilitate donning and\ndoffing. Sections are taken through the surface model to check\nthe design. Shaded images of the surface model are then displayed so that the model can be checked for geometry and\naesthetics (see figure).\nIn the original space-suit application , the inner layer of a\nglove is a bladder that retains air or oxygen at an internal pressure of 8.3 psi (57 kPa) . The bladder is made by use of a dip\nmold, which is a modified version of the original model cast\nfrom the hand . To begin fabrication of a dip mold, the CAD data\nare fed to a stereolithographic apparatus. In this apparatus, an\nultraviolet laser beam is scanned to trace and cure a thin slice\nof material on a platen at the top of a vat filled with an ultraviolet-curable monomeric liquid. The ultraviolet laser light polymerizes the monomer, forming a thin slice of the dip mold. An eleNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nvator in the vat lowers the platen and the\nlaser traces another slice. This sequence\nis repeated until the complete dip mold\nhas been formed. The dip mold is then\nremoved from the vat and postprocessed\ninto its final form.\nIn the original application, a glove also\nincludes a fabric restraint layer that rein-\n\nArrlazing\nHubble Irrtage\nNo\'W A FullColor Poster!\nOne of the Hubble Space Telescope\'s\nmost incredible discoveries - - the\nbirth of stars 7000 light years from\nEarth - - Is now captured in a gorgeous\nUrnlted-edltion wall poster.\nOnly $7.95 each .\nRush me___Hubble poster(s) at\n$7.95 each plus $5.00 for\nshipping (In tube).

In an older repair technique, a\n"fish-mouth" section containing the\ndefective portion of a tube was cut out\nof the tube and replaced by short tubular inserts that overlapped each other\nand extended beyond the cut opening.\nThe inserts were then welded at their\nends.

A SiC pIn-Junction Diode on a\nbroad insulating substrate is fabricated with\nthe help of the electrochemical-etching\nprocess.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nage, Vsee, with respect to the saturated\ncalomel electrode.\nIf, for example, the silicon carbide is of\nthe 6H polytype and is doped with electron donor atoms (n-doped), then the\nexposed surface of the silicon carbide is\nilluminated through a sapphire window at\nthe top of the vessel while the silicon carbide is maintained at an anodic potential\n(Vsee between 1.8 and 2.8 V) that promotes photoinduced corrosion. If the silicon carbide is of the 6H polytype and is\ndoped with electron acceptors (pdoped), then it can be etched in the dark\nat V""" between 0 and 2 V. The depth and\nstructure of the porous region formed in\nthe SiC is determined by a number of\nfactors, including the anodization time,\nthe applied potential, the intensity of\nultraviolet light (if used), the pH of the\nsolution, and the concentration of dopant\nin the silicon carbide.\nBy way of example, Ftgure 2 illustrates\nan application of this method to fabricate a\nsilicon carbide pin-junction diode supported by a broad, electrically insulating substrate. In this application, one takes advantage of the fact that porous SiC can be oxidized to Si02 at a rate much greater than\nthat of solid SiC because the pores present\nmuch greater surface area for oxidation.\nFirst, a wafer is fabricated by chemicalvapor deposition of a p-doped SiC epi-\n\nlayer and then an n-doped SiC epilayer\non an n-doped SiC substrate. A mask is\nplaced on the top n-doped epilayer, then\npattemed photolithographically. By use\nof the electrochemical etching method,\nthe part of the n-doped epilayer not covered by the mask is made porous to\nmake it highly susceptible to oxidation.\nThe resulting porous part of the layer is\noxidized to Si0 2 to make it highly susceptible to etching by hydrofluoriC acid,\nthen it is so etched to strip it away, leaving a mesa of n-doped SiC. The electrochemical etching method is then used\nagain, this time with process conditions\nselected to impart porosity to the\nexposed part of the p-doped SiC epilayer but not to the n-doped SiC. Then as\nbefore, the porous material is oxidized to\nSi02 and etched away, leaving a twolayer (n-doped/p-doped) mesa.\nNext, the electrochemical-etching\nmethod is applied, this time with process\nconditions chosen to impart porosity to\nthe n-doped SiC substrate only. Finally,\nthe porous substrate is oxidized to Si02 ,\nwhich is electrically insulating.\nThis work was done by Joseph S.\nShor and Anthony D.

Incorporating selected techniques of operations research, RCOMP facilitates\nexploration of tradeoffs among various\nmeasures of availability of systems and\nsubsystems to be maintained, costs of\nacquisition of maintenance packages,\nsubsequent costs of maintenance, performance with regard to maintenance,\nequivalent uniform annual life-cycle\ncosts, net investments, and total maintenance times . With respect to a given\nsystem to be maintained, RCOMP facilitates the selection of the optimal mix of\npreventive and corrective maintenance\nand the most cost-effective maintenance-acquisition strategy.\nSeveral assumptions are made to\nsimplify the basic equations of RCOMP.\nFirst, it is assumed that with respect to\na given subsystem, actions associated\nwith preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance (frequency and\ntime to perform) remain constant for the\ntime period between acquisition decisions. Second, it is assumed that the\neffectiveness of any given acquisition is\ninstantaneously achieved; that is, no\nphase-in time is necessary to reflect\nchanges in maintenance frequencies.\nThird , it is assumed that overall operational availability of the maintained system is maintained when acquisitions\nare made; th is is the most critical\nassumption as it enables the initial\nexamination of a system that is nearly\n100 percent operational. This assumption also implies that acquisition of\nmaintenance packages are not expected to increase failure rates or repair\ntimes. Fourth, the measure of equivalent uniform annual life-cycle cost incorporates the time value of money concepts and includes only the direct\nmaintenance labor and materials costs\nas well as the hardware and software\ncosts associated with the acquisition\n\n92\n\npackages. Traditional life-cycle costs,\nsuch as retirement costs and software\nmaintenance cost, are not included in\nthis measure.\nFor each subsystem and component\nof a given maintained system, RCOMP\nmaintains a data base of preventive and\ncorrective maintenance frequencies,\naverage time to perform each type of\nmaintenance, labor rates associated\nwith personnel performing both types\nof maintenance, and the costs of materials associated with both types of\nmaintenance. RCOMP also maintains a\ndata base on the acquisition of various\nmaintenance packages; included in this\ndata base are the costs of acquiring\nthese packages, the components and\nsubsystems that would be affected by\nthe acquisition of each package, and\nthe changes that would consequently\nbe induced in the baseline parameters\nof the system.\nThe two basic equations in RCOMP\nare the following:\ntotal maintenance time =\nns na\n\nI,I, [(1+ .< l1p)(1+ r l1p),tpTpM\'lt]\ni\n\ni\n\n+[(1+ .<l1 c)(1+ r l1 c ),tcTCM M]\nand\nns\n\nIJII\n\nf\n\nf\n\nI,I,[ (1+" ~P )(1+T ~p)(1+c ~p)\nAp\nCpMTPMM ]\n+[(1+,; ~P)(1+M ~p)APMPM~t]\n\n+[(1+). ~C )(1+T ~c )(1+c ~c )AcCCMT\n\nCM\n\nM]\n\n+[(1+,; ~C )(1+M ~c ) }..PMCM M ]\n+[CMW +CSW ]\nwhere\nns = the number of subsystems,\nna = the number of acquisitions,\nCMW = the cost of hardware,\nCsw = the cost of software,\nCCM = the labor rate for corrective\nmaintenance,\n\nCPM = the labor rate for preventive\nmaintenance,\nCMCM = the cost of materials for cor- ,\nrective maintenance,\nCMPM = the cost of materials for preventive maintenance,\nT CM = time to perform corrective\nmaintenance,\nTpM = time to perform preventive\nmaintenance,\nc~ = change in labor rate for corrective maintenance,\nc~p = change in labor rate for preventive maintenance,\nM~ = change in cost of materials for\ncorrective maintenance,\nM~ = change in cost of materials for\npreventive maintenance,\nT~ = change in corrective-maintenance time,\nT~ = change in preventive-maintenance time,\nM = incremental planning horizon,\n"\'" = frequency of corrective maintenance,\nAp = frequency of preventive maintenance,\nf~ = change in frequency of corrective maintenance, and\nI~ = change in frequency of preventive maintenance.\nWith respect to a given system to be\nmaintained, RCOMP searches for the\noptimal mix of preventive, corrective,\nand diagnostic system-maintenance\nstrategies, given the data on measures\nof reliability, cost, and risk associated\nwith the various subsystems and\npotential acquisitions of maintenance\npackages. In preparation for this\nsearch, a specification of the system\nand its subsystems, the baseline parameters of the system, and the parameters of maintenance packages that\ncould be acquired are entered into the\ndata base. RCOMP then calculates the\ntotal maintenance time and the total\nlife-cycle cost for all acquisitions.\nAn optimal maintenance curve is\nestablished by computationally removing the acquisitions, one at a time: The\nacquisition that is removed each time is\nthe one that contributes the least to the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nRdd Cutting Edge Technolog~ to Your\nManufacturing Processesl\nR T TEN D\n\n96\nuct and Process Design Engineering in Manufacturing\nNovember 12-14,1996 \xe2\x80\xa2 Cobo Center \xc2\xb7 Detroit, Michigan\n\nAUTOFACT \'96 is the industry\'s premier conference and\nexposition for advancing product and process design engineering\nin manufacturing.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA method for development of software has been named the "iterative/ incremental software development\nmethodology." This method governs a\nrisk-driven, architecturally focused software-development process that re duces significantly the risk and cost of\ndeveloping software in an environment\nof rapidly changing technology and\nevolving requirements. In contrast to the\nolder "waterfall" software-development\nmethod, the present method incorporates the best of iterative and incremental development. To implement this\nmethod, a requirement analysis is done\n\nbefore the beginning of any programming. Next, a schedule of development\nmilestones is created. By combining the\niterative and incremental programming\nefforts, one can create a final software\nproduct that satisfies requirements on\nschedule.\nThis work was done by David Durand,\nGeorge Heyworth, Ron Peugh, Dave\nWeller, and William Wessale of CAE-Unk\nCorp. for Johnson Space Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nSCientists at NASA\'s Johnson Space\nCenter have developed specialized disposable devices for use in filtering the cellular and acellular components of blood\nand other body-fluid samples. These\ndevices contain filters that are treated\nwith carbohydrate and protein compounds. which together with the physical\ncharacteristics of the filter act to retain the\ncellular components. allowing the acellular components (e.g.. serum) to pass\nthrough and be absorbed onto another.\nuntreated matrix. such as paper. The\npaper containing the serum is removed\nfrom the device. dried in air, and stored in\nan anaerobic. desiccated environment\nuntil analysis. The dried paper can be\nanalyzed up to six months later by washing it with water and analyzing the effluent\nwith conventional laboratory methods.\nPreviously, blood and other types of\nfluid samples were collected into evacuated glass or plastic tubes, which then\nhad to be centrifuged immediately to\nseparate the cellular and acellular phases. The acellular phases often had to be\nstored at -20\xc2\xb0 or -70\xc2\xb0C in order to preserve the analytes of interest. Using the\nfilter device obviates the need for centrifuges or freezers: All that is required to\ncollect and store blood samples are a\ncollection device, air to dry the serum\nfraction, and a bag containing an oxygen scavenger and a desiccant in which\nto store the dried paper.\nThe figure illustrates a typical bloodstorage device of this type. The sample\nis passed into the device through a tube,\nand enters a chamber bound on the\nfront side by a front plate (one of two\nparts of a plastic shell) and on the back\nside by a filter card. The volume of the\nchamber sets the upper limit of the volume of fluid that can be introduced into\nthe chamber. The front plate includes a\nrecess for this chamber, and a shallow\ndepression into which the filter card is\nseated, with a watertight seal forming\nthe chamber. The front plate also\nincludes an outer flange that adheres to\nthe back plate, the other part of the\nplastiC shell. with an air-tight seal.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nThe sample is filtered first through the\ntreated filter. and the acellular serum\nfraction is drawn onto the absorbent\nserum card. The first, treated filters consist mostly of glass fibers of 1-~m pore\nsize. Before the units are assembled,\nthese filters are dipped into a carbohy-\n\ntab is attached to the back plate, the\ntwo pull-tabs are used together to pull\nthe device apart and remove the\nabsorbing matrix once the collection\nprocess is complete.\nA related device, containing two\nabsorbent cellulose papers and no\n\n/.//\\\n./\n\n./ r .\n\nBack Plate\n(Part of Plastic Shell)\n\n./\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2./ \' /\n./,/\n\n\\\n\nPaper or Other\nAbsorbent Matrix\n\nFilter Card\n\nFront Plate\n(Part of Plastic Shell)\n\nThese Parts Are Assembled with adhesive around the edge to form air- and water-tight\nseals.

The second. untreated filter is\nabsorbent cellulose with a high Klemm\nfactor, which acts to pull the acellular\nfraction onto this second filter card. The\nback plate is attached to the front plate\nwith an adhesive on the flange. which\nmakes an air-tight seal that also holds\nthe second filter in its frame. A female\nLuer port is mounted on the back plate;\nthis port is connected to an aspirating\nsyringe that provides suction for collecting the specimen fluid. A second pull-\n\ntreated filter card, has been developed\nfor drying and storing urine samples.\nOther modifications can make devices\nsuch as these useful for filtering and\nstoring other types of body-fluid samples, such as saliva, tears, or peritoneal,\nsynovial. or cerebrospinal fluids. Other\nmodifications could involve using severa\x01 reagents on the filters to allow severa\x01 analytes to be assessed simultaneously. One practical example might be\nscreening for several addictive drugs or\nfor blood-borne viruses.\n95\n\nBecause older collection devices did\nnot allow immediate separation of cellular\nand acellular components of body-fluid\nsamples, the analytes of interest often\nwere affected by cell metabolism, cell\nlysis, or dilution during storage. The present device limits the potential for these\neffects by separating the cellular and\nacellular phases promptly. This advantage can be enhanced by chilling the\ndevices before and after their use, which\ncan further retard the chemical reactions\nthat can destroy unstable analytes.\n\nThis work was done by Peggy A.\nWhitson of Johnson Space Center and\nVaughan L.

The beverage is also useful for counteracting the\nhypohydration that occurs in astronauts\nduring space flight and in mountain\nclimbers and airline passengers exposed\nto low air pressures. The beverage not\nonly restores the overall volume of water,\nbut also aids restoration of the normal\nbalance between intracellular and extracellular fluids.\nWhy would one need to drink this or\nany other rehydration beverage instead\nof ordinary water? Under stressful conditions, the voluntary intake of fluids does\nnot keep up with the loss of fluids, leading to dehydration. The cause of this\nphenomenon is unknown, but the temperature and composition of a beverage,\nand the gastric and intestinal emptying\ntime (which influence the volume consumed and the rate of absorption by the\nbody) play important roles. The rate of\nabsorption of fluid from the intestinal\nlumen is maximal when the fluid has an\nosmolality of about 285 mOsmollkg (the\nfluid is approximately isotonic). Moreover,\ndrinking plain water does not replace\nsodium ions lost through sweating and\nurinary excretion .\nAccordingly, the present beverage was\nformulated with an osmolality that optimizes absorption and aids retention of\nplasma water. It is also designed to avoid\nthe disadvantages of traditional rehydration with salt tablets and water, which\ninclude the risk of hypernatremia (elevated levels of sodium in the blood). In addition, like commercial rehydration beverages, the present beverage includes a\nnoncaloric sweetener (aspartame) that\n\nhelps induce voluntary consumption.\nThe ingredients in this beverage are 9\ng of sodium chloride, 15.44 g of sodium\ncitrate, 0.72 g of aspartame, and the\nbalance of water to a total volume of 2 L.\nThe osmolality is 270 mOsmollkg, which\nis close to the optimum fluid-absorption\nvalue.\nThe present beverage and five others\nwith higher and lower osmolality were\ntested for hypervolemic response in\nhuman subjects under various conditions\nof rest and exercise. The other beverages\nwere (a) water sweetened with aspartame (30 mOsmollkg). (b) a sodium chloride solution sweetened with aspartame\n(70 mOsmollkg), (c) a glucose/sodium\ncitrate solution (650 mOsmollkg), (d) a\ncommercial rehydration beverage (380\nmOsmollkg), and (e) another commercial\nrehydration beverage (390 mOsmollkg).\nFrom measures of plasma osmolality,\nplasma volume, and concentration of\nsodium and potassium in plasma, the\npresent hyperhydration beverage performed better than the others during rest\nand performed comparably or better during exercise. Thus, the improved hyperhydration beverage should prove useful\nfor increasing physical performance and\nto protect the body from excessive dehydration during stress situations.\n\nThis work was done by John E.\nGreenleaf of Ames Research Center.\nFor further information, write in 96 on\nthe TSP Request Card.\nThis invention has been patented by\nNASA (U.S. Patent No. 5,447(730).\nInquiries concerning nonexclusive or\nexclusive license for its commercial\ndevelopment should be addressed to\nthe Patent Counsel, Ames Research\nCenter; (415) 604-5104.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAntibodies specific to some peptides\nin hepatitis C viruses have been produced by hybridomas that were generated by electrofusion of human myeloma cells with lymphocytes from the\nperipheral blood of a human volunteer\ninfected with hepatitis C. The production of monoclonal antibodies specific\nto hepatitis C is significant because\nheretofore, such antibodies have not\nbeen available, and there has been a\ngrowing need for them in medical\nresearch . With suitable modifications,\nthese antibodies could become the\nbasis of commercial products for\nimmunotherapy and for use as controls\nin hepatitis C antibody assays.\nThe process for making the antibodies begins with the collection of samples\nof blood from volunteers known to be\ninfected with hepatitis C. The mononuclear-ceil fraction of the collected blood\nis prepared by density centrifugation on\na Ficoll-Hypaque (or equivalent) cushion.

Once the\nmononuclear-cell fraction has been\nrecovered, the NK cells are removed by\nincubation with leucyHeucine methyl\nester.\nThe remaining T and 8 cells are coactivated by use of a T-cell activator,\nincluding phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or anti-CD3 monoclonal\nantibodies. Supplemental interleukins,\nincluding IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 andlor\nconcanavalin A supernatant are used as\nadditional factors for stimulation of 8cells. After 48 hours, the 8-cell blasts\nare harvested, washed, and suspended\nin a hypoosmolar electrofusion medium\n(75-milliosmolar sorbitol solution supplemented with calcium and magnesium acetate). These cells are mixed\nwith equal numbers of similarly prepared H7 human myeloma cells, which\nserve as the electrofusion partners.\nThe cell mixture is transferred to an\nelectrofusion chamber, where the cells\nare first aligned by a signal of 5-V amplitude at a frequency of 1.5 GHz for 30\nseconds. At the end of the 30 seconds,\nthe cells are fused with a single pulse of\n45 to 60 V.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1996\n\nThe electrofused cells are then grown\nin a medium supplemented with hypoxanthene aminopterine thymidine to\nselect viable hybridomas.

With the\nintelligence of the designers embedded\nin the software, the system becomes\nautonomous in monitoring for, and\nresponding to, faults.\nThis work was done by Thomas K.\nBrown and James A.

NPO-19836\n\nAnalysis of Carrier\nTracking by Cascaded\nPhase-Locked Loops\nA report presents an analysis of the\nperformance of a carrier-aiding technique, which employs cascaded phaselocked loops (PLLs). This technique can\nbe useful when two unequal antennas\nare required to coherently demodulate\nthe received signal, but due to an\nextremely weak signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) level and high Doppler rates, the\nsmaller antenna PLL is unable to lock on\nthe carrier on its own. In this scheme, the\ncarrier signal is assumed to be strong\nenough that the PLL in the receiver of the\nlarger antenna can synchronize to the\ncarrier and thereby provide a phase reference for down-conversion of the carrier in the receiver of the smaller antenna.\nThus, the PLL in the receiver of the smaller antenna has only to coherently track\nthe residual Doppler shift between the\ntwo antennas, and can use a narrower\nloop bandwidth than otherwise possible.\nThis work was done by Mazen M.\nShihabi, Biren N. Shah, and Sami M.\nHinedi of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

When they were\nused, the beryllium copper strips were\nbonded to foam insulating material and\nhave come loose from the foam after thermal cycling between ambient temperature\nand -423 OF (-255\xc2\xb0C). The loose strips\ncould become debris, which could not be\ntolerated in this application. The wire\nmesh is bonded (partially impregnated) to\nthe foam with polyurethane adhesive. A\nportion of the wire mesh that overlaps the\numbilical disconnect is impregnated with\nsilver-filled epoxy. In comparison with the\nberyllium copper strips, the wire mesh has\nbeen found to be relatively insensitive to\ndifferential thermal shrinkage and to\nadhere better.

With\nthis process, we can create a wide\nvariety of solid or hollow shapes\nin various sizes using either carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless\nsteel, nickel alloy, or titanium,\nwith relatively low tooling costs even for short runs. The technology not only reduces our customers\' materials cOSts, but it also\nreduces downstream costs, since\n\nnear-net parts require less\nmachining and mechanical finishing than competicive technologies. Overall, the financial benefits of choosing near-net extrusion can be substantial."\nThe near-net extrusion operation begins with a solid round bar\nthat is cur into shorter billetS.\nEach billet is induction-heated to\nthe correct extrusion temperature\nand is coated with a powdered\nglass during transfer to the extrusion chamber. The steel is forced\nthrough a die under high pressure\nat speeds up to 30 mph to provide\nthe desired shape and is then aircooled or rapidly water-quenched.\nAfter cooling, the extrusions are\n"stretch straightened" - an important step in controlling the bow\nand twist of the fmal product.\nPlymouth discards dies after each\nextrusion, minimizing an erosion\nprocess called "die wash." This is\nessen tial to achieving the consistent quality and close rolerances\nrequired by customers.\n\nFor mor~ information on\nPlymouth\'s standard near-net\nStainless steel shapes include tees, Plymouth\'s n~ar-ntt extrusion\nequal and unequal leg angles, proem, contact Plymouth Extrutkd\nchannels, and beams. pecialized, Shap~s, Plymouth Tube Co., P.o.\ncustom-order shapes may include Box 768, Warrenvilk, IL 60555;\ncross-membered partS, as well as Tel: 800-323-9506; Fax: 708partS requiring varying degrees of 393-3552.\nFor More Information WIfte In No. 856\nangularity, transverse flatness,\nbows, or twi ts.\n\nINTEGRATED ENGINEERING SOFTWARE\nNEW Electromagnetic-Thermal Coupled CAE Software\nIntegrated Engineering Software has released the CAE industry\'s first coupled Electromagnetic-Thermal CAE solution\nbased solely on the innovative\nBoundary Element Method\n(BEM) technology. Now designers searching for an al ternative to\ncomplex electromagnetic-thermal\nFEM modeling can take advantage of BEM\'s superior ease of use,\nanalysi speed, and accuracy. This\ncoupled Electromagnetic-Thermal software solution enables\ndesigners to test various physical\nand material configurations,\nexamine new design conceptS, and\noptimize designs for a wide variety\nof Electromagnetic-Thermal applications prior ro actually building a costly prorotype.\n\nInductive/Conductive\nHeating Applications\nDesigners of induccion heating/hardening systems or conductive heating designs are able to\nsimulate coupled Electro-magnet-\n\n104\n\nic Thermal systems in one software environment. For inductive\nheating/hardening applications,\ndesigners can take advantage of\nIntegrated\'s coupled Oersted and\nKelvin software tools. Oersted is\nIntegrated\'s two-dimensional timeharmonic field solver (shown) and\nKelvin is the thermal analysis\nsolver. And, for conductive heating applications, designers can\neffortlessly\nmove\nbetween\nIntegrated\'s coupled Electro and\nKelvin. Electro is\nIntegrated\'s two dimensional electrostatic field solver.\nDesigners can\nexam IDe electromagnetic properties\nsuch as capacitance,\ninductance, resistance, ohmic losses,\neddy current, force,\nrorque, and many\nother properties.\nAnd, with a simple\nmen u\nselection,\n\nthey can review the coupled thermal properties such as temperature, heat flow, temperature gradients, and other thermal properties.\n\nInnovative CAE\nTechnology - BEM\nIntegrated Engineering Software is the only provider of a full\nrange of electromagnetic and thermal CAE productS based on\nthe Boundary Elemenr Method\n\n(BEM).
