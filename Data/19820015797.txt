Iles\nApplied -Solar Energy Corporation\nCity of hdustry, California 91746\n\nsire\n\nOrientat iondependentetching (ODE) can be used t o\nsilicon. The method\nhas several possible advantages including high slicing yield (m k g ) , plane paraliel, thin\nslices, ready for processing and t h e chance of high throughput and bur costs. There\na r e limitatiorls in the need for simple crystals, and in restricted depth of slicing.\nAnalysis of the overall properties of t h e ODE method has added insight into t h e\nrequirements of a successfill waferin? method.\nBACKGROUND\nOr ientat iondepcndent (OD)\nslicing uses preferential etching dow 1 narrow slots\nin a silicon slab on forrn slices. This method of slicir,g was investigated to see if i t s\nadvantages could be used t o form ,.lore slices from h ~ g hquality silicon crystals than\ncan be achieved by mechanical slicing methods. In particular. an attractive feature\nwas t h e possibility of forming thin slices (-5Oum), ready for cell processing; present\nmethods for etching thin slices from already sliced silicon involve large losses of\nsilicon. OD slicing has some limitations. which restrict t h e cell designs av- We.\nAttempts to overcome these ;imita\'ions have led t o study of differer t m e t k for\nprocessing t h e dices into cells and arrays.\n\nOR IENTATIQN-DEPENDEFT SLICING\n\nOD etching has been used t o form solar cell structures, including vertical\nmultijunction cells (11, etched groove cells (2), and polkadot cells (3). However, OD\nslicing requires formation of cansiderably deeper grooves.\nFigure 1 shows a typical slicing sequence. (110) orienrated slabs a r e c u t from\n<I 1l > orientated crystals. The slab thickness determ incs t h e eventual slice width,\nbut there is no requirement for e s t r e m e accuracy in cutting t h e slabs. The slabs are\nzhemically polished, a r d coated with SiU and/or Si3N4 wFlich a c t as masking layers\nduring the OD etching. Usins a s ~ o t - ~ a $ t e r n\nmask and optical photolithography, a\nclose-spaced, fine slot pahtern is opened ir t h e masking layers. An OD etchant\n(T ?ically 30M KOH at 85 C) is used to etch down t h e slots; slices a r e formed when\nthe slots a r e etctbcd thrcuqh.

These methods include use of a heavily\ndoped P+ layer, a few rn icrome ters thick formed at t h e back s u r f a c e to supplement t h e\n\n19\nmasking layers. These P + layers (for concentrations >6r10 ~ m \' ~ r)e attacked very\na\nslowly by t h e etchants, so t h a t t h t v act a s a self-stopping membrane at t h e bottom of\nt h e slots. Such a stopping layer c?n also help t o allow complete slot etchinq when t h e\ne t c h r a t e may differ in different slots. W e have also studied t h e use of t o p surface\nsupport methods. Ry mask design, support s t r u t s can be left at intervals across t h e\nslot pattern. It is also possible to change t h e mask design t o provide many mask\nbridges across each slot. There is some conflict involved in t h e need for slice support\nduring formation, and t h e need for easy removal later in t h e process, and this will be\ndiscussed in t h e fie8.;section.\n\nThe slot wid+5. slice thickness. and slot depth (slice width) values used were\n-IOum, -50um, and -1000um, respectively. V1e found several factors which s a v e\nvariable etching in t h e deep slots. Recause of capillary effects, it was observed t h z t\nt h e e t c h a n t near t h e bottom of t h e slots could become depleted, thus slowinq t h e\netching rate. This e t c h depletion could also a f f e c t t h e oxidation r a t e of t h e (1 11)\nsurfaces; if t h e slot faces a r e not protected, sideways etching can proceed by ledge\nexposore. In addition stresses at t h e top surrrlce mask-silicon interface, or severe\ncrystallographic defects on t h e etchinp: slot faces, could also lead to sidways erosion.\nW e did not find c l e a r c u t connection between edge dislocations on t h e t o p slab surface\nslot wall etching. No m a t t e r\no r on the slice faces, and t h e occurence of e x c e s s i ~ ?\nwhat t h e reason, this enhanced sidewavs etching formed very thin slices on parts of\nt h e slab, and often while t h e slots were etching deep, t h e slot pattern was "washedout". Compounding these sideways etching problems was t h e formation of limitink\nsurfaces near t h e Oottorn of t h e slots. These limiting surfaces w e r e t h e family of (1 11)\nf a c e s which are not at right angles t o t h e !I 10) surface. (Figures 5,6.) These limiting\nsurfaces slowed the e t c h rate. either requiring very long e t c h times t o complete t h e\nslots. with greater chance of sideways etching, or they hindered methods developed to\nseparate t h e completed slices.\n\nW did form many slices -1000-1250um thick. but t h e slicing was incomplete\ne\nacross t h e slab. These etching problems have slowed development of t h e slicing\nmethod. To avoid processinp, of many separate thin slizes, we considered use of\n"matrix processinq" wberein comp!ete cells cculd be formed on t h e supported slices,\nbefore separation and use with spectral concentration (7).\nCOM%!L?EF!TS OR\' OP SL1CINC\nIt is instructive t o use the experience of t h e ODE slicing method. t o add insight\ninto t h e waferinq requirements needed t o m e e t t h e cor: goals of t h e rrOE solar cell\nprograms.\n\nSlicing is needed for qrown or cast ingots of silicon. Present trends in these\ningot technologies involve combination of reasonably pure starting silicon, growth t o\nprovide large .r4ins (>mm size), and for reduced casts, growth of large ingots +I00 kg\nper growth sequence for cont.inuous Czochralski or FZ m ~ ; : n ) d ~ ,\n+50kg for c a s t ingots.\nClearly these large ingots should be processed a s large slices, and failure to m e e t this\nrequirement . , s the m a j ~ rdisadvantage of t h e OPE method. As t h e cost of t h e\nn\nstarting s i l i ~ ~ and the costs of growth a r e decreased, kerf losses can be\naccommodated, although t h e cost of g e ~ e r a t i n g-50% scrap silicon will always be a\nheavy price to pay. Mos* casting methods gi1.e polycrystalline silicon, and ODE cannot\nbe used in these cases: the mechanical methods have no similar limitations.\n\nPresent dav techncloqy (C-.cchralski c r v s t a l s s l i c e ~ \'hv Ir s a v d strews t h a t t h e\ns l i c i n ~throughput is ar? e a r l v !xxtieneck in t h e vphole c e l l ?rocessino sequer?ce, a n d\nalready much s p a c e a n t upkeen is r e a u i r e ~ for t h e manv I p a c h i n e s r?eeded.\nF\nAyumine, a \\ ~ o r k i n ~ ~ c of r ?O hcurs. presw.t 1" rrac\'lines car! c u t of\' t-*afers a t -7\n!s\nm ;day; at 20.7 m /kc yield, this means z_tkc/rclchine/c\'~v.
