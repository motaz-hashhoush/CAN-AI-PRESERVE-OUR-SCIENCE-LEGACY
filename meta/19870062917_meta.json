A total of 96 mission scenarios were identified by combining two power levels, two propellants, four values of specific impulse per propellant, three starting altitudes, and two starting velocities. Sixty of these scenarios were selected for a detailed trajectory analysis; a complete propulsion system study was then conducted for 20 of these trajectories. Trip times ranged from 344 days for a xenon propulsion system operating at 300 kW total power and starting from lunar orbit with escape velocity, to 770 days for an argon propulsion system operating at 300 kW total power and starting from nuclear start orbit with circualr velocity. Trip times for the 3 MW cases studied ranged from 356 kW to 413 days. Payload masses ranged from 5700 to 12,300 kg for the 300 kW power level, and from 72,200 to 81, 500 kg for the 3 MW power level.", "title": "Nuclear powered Mars cargo transport mission utilizing advanced ion propulsion", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T05:37:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870062917, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Galecki, Diane L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center; Sverdrup Technology, Inc.", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "dfd3518fe7fb4fd38ed974d7d49bdc7c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19870062917, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Patterson, Michael J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "3ed52dee3d2a43838a1b7d6a61070215"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870062917, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870062917, "id": "fc8520197e5c4a2a9b358cf56562bf00", "publicationDate": "1987-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
