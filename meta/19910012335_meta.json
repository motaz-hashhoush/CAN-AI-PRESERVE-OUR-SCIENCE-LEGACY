The radial velocity measurements have a range resolution of 150 m. With a pulse repetition rate of 20 Hz, it is possible to perform scannings in two perpendicular vertical planes in approx. 72 s. By continuously operating the Lidar for about an hour, one can extract stable statistics of the radial velocities. Assuming that the turbulence is horizontally homogeneous, the mean wind, its standard deviations, and the momentum fluxes were estimated. From the vertically pointing beam, the first, second, and third moments of the vertical velocity were also estimated. Spectral analysis of the radial velocities is also performed from which, by examining the amplitude of the power spectrum at the inertial range, the kinetic energy dissipation was deduced. Finally, using the statistical form of the Navier-Stokes equations, the surface heat flux is derived as the residual balance between the vertical gradient of the third moment of the vertical velocity and the kinetic energy dissipation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910012335, "id": "4b6c0ba239d844d8bd985dc8ef0c96d8", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910012335.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910012335/downloads/19910012335.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910012335/downloads/19910012335.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910012335/downloads/19910012335.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
