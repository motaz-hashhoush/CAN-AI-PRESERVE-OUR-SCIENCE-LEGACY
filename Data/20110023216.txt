INTRODUCTION\nThe Human Engineering Modeling and Performance\n(HEMAP) Lab originated due to the complex and\nchallenging workspace design issues the Space Shuttle\nposed\non\ntechnicians\nperforming\nmaintenance,\nmodifications, and repair operations. The HEMAP Lab\nincludes a motion capture system that\' captures\nbiomechanical motions of humans and perfornis various\ndetailed ergonomic analyses of high risk operafions. With\nthe previous knowledge, skills and capabilit.i~s developed\nduring the Space Shuttle and Constellation (Programs, the\nHEMAP Lab has evolved into a one of a kind state-of-theart capability at KSC, which will prove to be very beneficial\nto design flight and ground hardware, and the related human\ntasks, to ensure safe, efficient, and effective ground, flight,\n\nand non earth terrestrial habitation and processing of future\nspace systems. [1,2]\nOne recent and very important accomplishment of the\nHEMAP team was the analysis of the installation/removal\n(l/R) of four Avionics Boxes (AB) planned for test flights of\nthe Orion crew module. Three technicians of varying stature\nwere used to simulate the installation and removal of the\nfour avionics components. One technician picks up the\navionics box component from the hatch dive board and then\npasses the component to an Installation Technician (IT)\nwhile a third technician served as an installation/removal\nQuality Inspector (Q1). Dozens of task scenarios were\nperformed using many variations. Observations and data\nwere collected real-time, through technician inputs, and via\nviewing and assessment of recorded playbacks of the tasks\nwith ergonomic evaluation software applications.\nThe project requirements for this assessment were\ndeveloped and agreed upon using customer requirements\nquestionnaires and discussions. The purpose of this project\nwas meant to aid in the identification of process\nimprovements and possible tooling that could prevent\noccurrences of collateral damage and personnel injury\ncaused by limited access, awkward postures, and/or limited\nfield of view during avionics box I1R.\nIt was determined that the prime scope of this initial\nassessment would include overall access, gross motor tasks,\nvisibility, and lateral reach. Detailed assessment of fine\nmotor tasks, performed inside the cavities where the box is\nmounted, including reach to fasteners, arrnlhand/tool access\nbetween components and their respective walls, and tool\ngrasps within confined areas were not evaluated and were\nplanned for extended studies.\n\n2. METHODS\nThe HEMAP Crew Module (CM) mockup is an openframe construction to allow visibility for the motion capture\ncameras. Accuracy of the fabricated mockup was checked\nagainst CAD data. Wood was used as the core of the CM\n\nfloors, designed to be weight-bearing for multiple\ntechnicians and objects and nonslip. The wood was painted\nwith fire retardant paint. Wire mesh was used to represent\nthe workspace envelopes. This mockup method developed\nby the HEMAP is easily adaptable and is used for many\nother types of CM analysis and is extremely efficient at\nreducing costs as compared to a physical simulation that\ndoes not use motion capture immersed into a CAD model of\nthe vehicle.\nThe motion capture system was used to capture various\nscenarios of real human participants simulating the\ninstallation offour avionics boxes (B I, B2, B3, B4) within a\nrepresentative mockup. Each avionics box was constructed\nout of wire mesh and rods, according to their dimensional\nattributes. The weight being handled at any time by any\ntechnician was less than 2 pounds. (the true mass of the box\nis included into the biomechanical analysis). For the motion\ncapture sessions, each subject and component were marked\nso motions would be tracked and viewed within the CAD\nelectronic environments. See Figure - I, 2&3\n\nFigure 2 Box, Access, and Non Access Areas\nKey features of the mockup were removable platforms\nwhich allowed the team to trial a variety of configurations\nfor technicians to install the four avionics boxes either by\nworking atop the platforms or with the platforms removed to\nallow working directly in the access areas A I-A4.\nRemovable platforms were fabricated and placed atop the\nbackbone structure openings (A I-AS) during portions of the\nmotion capture tasks.\nTechnicians for this project were selected to closely\nrepresent a 5th Percentile and a 95th Percentile Army\nAnthropometric Survey (ANSUR) male in stature and\nweight, allowing analysis of a broad range of sizes, and\ncovering possible technicians populations from a short to tall\nstature male. Female Technicians were not available at the\ntime of the captures, so the software analysis did not include\nfemale ergonomic evaluations. See Table-I.\n\nTable 1 Subject Height and Weight\nSubiects\n5th Percentile\n5th Percentile\n5th Percentile\n95 th Percentile\n95 th Percentile\n\nFigure 1 Mockup and Motion Capture\nThe inner configuration of the Crew Module (CM)\nincluded inner mold lines, curved aft bulkhead, side hatch\nopening, side hatch platform, forward bulkhead, docking\nring, inner wall footprints; and other mounted components\nand wire/cabling. The work areas were broken down into\nfive zones formed by the structure of the CM. Work areas\nutilizing removable platforms placed atop the structure were\ndesignated as A I through A4. Areas with No Access (NA)\nwere blocked for access by placing wire fence. The four\nboxes are labeled B I-B4. See Figure- 2.\n\nHeight\n162.1 cm\n163.3\n161.6 cm\n187.0 cm\n188 cm\n\nWeight\n77.3 kg\n65.5 kg\n65.9 kg\n101.0 k!!\n99.5 kg\n\nTechnicians used for this project had experience in\nsimilar activities as part of Space Shuttle operations. One\nhad performed tasks within the Orion ground test article,\nwhich offered insight and lessons learned to the team and\nother technicians regarding working in the nearly identical\nsized mockup performing similar handling tasks. The\ntechnician pool had received prior general training on proper\ngeneral lifting techniques, using smooth and no sudden\nacceleration. Each technician was experienced with lifting\ncritical, fragile components. The moderate width of each\ncomponent allowed for standard hand separation.\nTechnicians performed the motions at the HEMAP Lab\nunder environmentally controlled conditions.\nTechnicians were able to remove particular portions of\nthese platforms and stood in the access area or kneeled on\nthe platform covering the access area. The A I platform just\ninterior to the side hatch opening was installed throughout\nall tasks and assessments.\n\n2\n\nBased on Customer input, all motion capture tasks\nassumed the use of a lifting/lowering device (LLD). The\ndesign of the lifting device had yet to be developed. For\nproject evaluation, representation of a lifting device was\nsimulated by a participant who guided the part over to the\ninstallation location. The part was suspended by cords as it\nwas lowered into position by the technician.\nFigure-3 shows two technicians kneeling on the\ninstalled platform A I and A2 while installing avionics box 4\n(B4). The technician holding the box is kneeling on the A2\nplatform, the technician simulating the box lifting/lowing\ndevice (box held by string) is kneeling on Al platform.\n\npartIcIpant feedback, ergonomic/human factors analyses,\nparticipant visibility, and real-time and animation reviews.\nIncluded in the ergonomic/human factors analysis were the\nbiomechanical lower back analysis, fatigue analysis, access,\nreach, and visibility, which included the participant inputs.\nTechnicians participated in several capture activities to\nsimulate the installation, removal, and inspection of the four\ncomponents. The technicians\' feedback, Customer inputs,\nergonomics, and process requirements were factors used to\ndevelop recommendations.\nAs motions were performed, they were captured within\nthe HEMAP system and fed into two evaluation software\napplications. HEMAP used Siemens Jack to view live\nmotions, shown as avatars within an electronic environment\nof the CM and components. Within Jack, as motions were\noccurring, the HEMAP Team was also able to perform\npreliminary real-time ergonomic analyses. Concurrently with\nJack, HEMAP used recently integrated DELMIA to also\nview the live motions and electronic environment. After\nmotion captures were recorded for later playbacks, each\nmotion task scenario was reviewed and evaluated in each of\nthe software analyses packages.\nThe renderings in Jack and DELMIA produced graphics\ndiffering primarily in avatar, or manikin, skins. The virtual\nenvironment of the CM and components were similar in that\nthey were nearly incomparable in graphic quality, providing\nsimilar levels of details.\nEven though HEMAP fabricated and used platforms\nwithin the mockup to simulate areas most feasible for future\nplatforms, the actual platforms themselves do not appear in\nthe electronic, computer environment. In screenshots\nrepresenting platforms installed, it will appear as technicians\nare hovering at the top plane of the platform heights with\ntheir knees, prone posture, or feet if standing on actual\nmockup platforms. Likewise, graphics of the represented\ninstallation aid (actual cord tether in the physical mockup)\ndoes not appear in the electronic environment.\nMoving the platforms in and out of the mockup were\nnot evaluated for ergonomic, feasibility, or human factors\nassessment. For ~ach motion capture evaluated, platforms\nwere either installed or removed before the start of action\nbegan for recording and assessment purposes.\n\nFigure 3 Technicians Working from Platforms\nFigure-4 shows a configuration which shows three\ntechnicians, one technician standing on platform A I and\nsimulating the box lowering apparatus, a second technician\nkneeling on A2 platform holding the box, and the Quality\nInspector (QI) standing in the removed platform for A3.\n\n3.1 Task Sequence Analysis\nDuring pre-task discussions, including review of the\nCM mockup and component configurations and tasks to be\nperformed, the Team deduced that a particular order of\ncomponent installations would be needed to allow\ntechnicians access in simulating fastening and installing the\ncomponents. The list of feasible order of operations were\nfollowed during the motion capture analysis. Motion\ncaptures were performed with a variety of scenarios\nincluding platforms in, platforms out, 5th Percentile\nInstaller, and 95th Percentile Installer.\n\nFigure 4 Three Technicians\n\n3. A ALYSIS\nDuring and after performing various scenarios of real\nhuman participants simulating the installation of 4 avionics\nboxes within a representative mockup, pros and cons of the\nsimulated process results were evaluated by the team who\ndeveloped recommendations based on customer inputs,\n\n3\n\n3.2 Lower Back Analyses (LRA); Compression Forces\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and\nHealth (NIOSH) has established a limit of 3400 Newtons (a\nunit of force required to impart acceleration of lift to the\nmass being lifted) as a safety limit for compressive force to\nthe lumbar region of the spine. HEMAP references this\nvalue during evaluations within the ergonomic software\nevaluation applications to determine safe lifting ranges. All\nof the lower back compression, or Lower Back Analysis\n(LBA), forces experienced by the technicians during the\nAvionics Box tasks performed were below the\nrecommended 3400N safe limit. This was primarily due to\nthe simulation of the LLD installation aid which resulted in\nthe components only being weighted to the mass of the\nmockup materials that were used to fabricate them. Jack\'s\nLow Back Compression Analysis tool is based on a complex\nbiomechanical low back model which is described in\npublished articles: [3] Raschke, U. (1994) and [4] Raschke,\nU., Martin, BJ and Chaffin, D.B. (1996)\n\nFigure 5 Estimated View of Technician\n\n4. EXAMPLES\nThe section goes through one example which focuses\nmainly on the installation technician, and on the lower back\nstress.\n\n3.3 Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA)\n\n4.1 Comparing Platfom In vs. Platform Out\n\nThe RULA tool which examines the upper body posture\nand arms did not provide additional insight into any of the\ntasks, as it always interpreted the tasks as a level 7 - a\ncondition requiring immediate intervention to alleviate the\nposture. Since the components are configured below\ntechnician torsos and since the technicians cannot get level\nwith the components during installations within the CM, it\nwas expected by Human Factors Analysts that the upper\nlimb forces and evaluations would reflect higher limits.\nAs experienced with similar shuttle processing,\napplying proper lifting techniques and padding to reduce\ncontact stress during long task durations of carefully placing\nthe avionics box, should prevent risks during these\ninfrequent tasks.\n\nThis configuration did a comparison of the Installer\nPlatform in versus out, with a 5th percentile installation\ntechnician of stature and wieght. The results showed that the\nInstallation Technicians (IT) preferred to work with the\nInstaller Platform out, while installing B3 and B4. This was\nconfirmed after assessing results in the ergonomic analyses\nsoftware.\nA 5th Percentile IT experienced a lower back\ncompression of 1597 Newtons (N) with the Installer\nPlatform out and a lower back compression of 2 I23 N with\nthe platform in. Therefore, both values of platform scenarios\nrepresented safe lifting ranges under 3400 N. Ultimately,\nbeing able to standlkneel within the access area A3 and A4\ncavity, nearest the components, allowed for more natural\npostures than when lying prone (Figure-8) on the platforms\nin the same locations. Figure-6 shows the analysis software\nJack, and Figure-7 shows the analysis software DELMIA.\n\n3.4 Reach and Visibility\nDuring each scenario, reach and visibility were\nevaluated as well as technician natural behaviors and\ntechnical limitations. Through discussions and performances\nof the tasks, the consensus of technicians is that these\ncomponents will require torquing from the back side and,\ndue to this, it will be necessary to work from the Aft\nBulkhead with the platforms out to allow the torque-wrench\nswing required. See Figure-5 for the estimated view of the\ntechnician in the modeling software.\n\nFigure 65 th Percentile Installer in Gray\n\n4\n\nFigure 95th Percentile Inataller\n\nFigure 7 DELMIA Analysis of Installer Platform Out\n\nFigure 10 95th Percentile Installer in Blue\n\nFigure 8 Technician Lying Prone\n\n4.3 Static Strength Prediction\n\n4.2 Comparing 5th vs. 95th Percentile Installer\n\nStatic Strength Prediction analysis of 8 I and 82\ninstallation/removal and quality tasks showed that a higher\npercentage of the population would be capable of\nperforming the tasks with the platforms out than with the\nplatforms in.\n\nFurther comparisons were made between installing\ncomponents 83 and 84 with a 95th percentile technician\nagainst a 5th percentile technician in stature and weight. It\nwas determined that a 5th percentile technician should\ninstall the components as they are shorter of stature and are\nnot forced to lean over as far into the avionics bays, which\ncauses more strain on the lower back. A 5th percentile\ntechnician experienced a lower back compression force of\n1597 N compared with a 95th percentile technician who\nexperienced a lower back compression of 2695 N. Figure9&10\n\n4.4 Reach\nThe subjects\' arm lengths ranged from below the 5th\npercentile to the 90th percentile. From a lying prone posture\non a platform or from kneeling or standing directly atop A2\nand A3, each technician was able to reach down to the\nbottom of the box openings. However, reach within the\navionics bays amid the components is a concern due to\nlimited space which may not allow adequate hand/arm\nmotions.\n\n4.5 Visibility\nDue to the components being placed in the centers of\nthe avionics bays for the baseline assessment, technicians\nreported they were able to see to the lowest edge of the outer\nplanes of each wireframe mockup component during\ninstallation and removal. The Jack and DELMIA fIrst-\n\n5\n\nperson eye view software evaluations also confi.nned the\neffective visibility. Figure-II.\n\nBased on these designs, there was not enough space for\na technician to thoroughly place his hands down the sides of\neach component due to the tight configurations. Even with\nbare hands and no markers, concerns were addressed\nregarding whether there would be sufficient room to\nmanipulate tools on the sides of each of the component\nboxes. See Figure-12 and 13.\n\nFigure 11 View of Box in Restricted Space\nFigure 12 Restricted Access Around Box\n4.6 Other Analysis\nSeveral other analyses were perfonned. For example for\nthe boxes B I and B2 further away from A2 and A3,\ntechnicians advised that they preferred to use the platfonns\nto perfonn these tasks for B I and B2. Lying on platforms\nwould prevent technicians from having to reach across either\nthe B3 or B4 components. Also having adjacent, A I and A4\nplatfonns installed allowed for tool placement and ability to\nstretch beyond A2 and A3 workspaces. Lying on the A2 and\nA3 center platfonns helped to reduce strain on the lower\nback when reaching further away from the box opening. At\nthese postures, additional pressure was placed on the knees\nand ankles, a trade willingly accepted by the technicians\nwho did not experience pre-existing knee or ankle\nconditions that would be cause for further assessment.\nFurthennore, motion captures were perfonned with a\nvariety of scenarios including platfonns in, platfonns out,\n5th Percentile Installer, and 95th Percentile Installer.\nStanding, kneeling, lying prone, bent or straight arms, etc.\nwere analyzed. Additionally the Installation Technician (IT)\nand the Quality Inspector (QI) positions and locations were\nstudied. During each scenario, along with biomechanical and\nstatic strength, reach and visibility were evaluated, as well as\nnatural behaviors and physical workspaces and limitations.\n\nFigure 13 Limited Hand Space\n\nIt was detennined that more detail assessments would\nneed to be perfonned to detennine true physical workspace\nlimitations and feasible handling methods for installations\nand removals. For this project primarily large body motions\nwere assessed to detennine whether technicians benefited\nfrom platfonns being installed or not in handling these\ncomponents. In addition, reach to the outward planes of the\ncomponents and downward to the Aft Bulkhead, where the\nlowest fasteners would be, were detennined to be feasible\nwith the technician pool used and general placement of\ncomponents within the centers of the cavities.\n\n5. WORKSPACES LIMITATIONS\nFor the purposes of the initial assessment of the\nAvionics handling, the boxes were centered within each\ncavity as overall handling, gross motor tasks, lateral reach,\nand visibility to the Aft Bulkhead were assessed.\n\n6\n\n6. RELATED STUDIES\nThe Avionics Box Cold Plate Damage Prevention paper\nexplains lessons learned from the Space Shuttle Program\nwhile describing the cold plate damage problems and the\ncorrective actions for preventing future damage to aerospace\navionics cold plate designs. [5]\nDuring the Constellation program analysis was done for\nthe Ares rocket to improve avionics box placement for the\ntechnicians. [6] In order to have the efficient and effective\nground processing inside and outside the vehicle, all of the\nground processing activities were analyzed. The analysis\nwas performed by engineers, technicians, and human factors\nengineering experts with spacecraft processing experience.\nThe procedure used to gather data was accomplished by\nobserving human activities within physical mockups. Figure14\n\n7. LESSONS LEARNED\nI. Technicians familiar with shuttle and crew module\ncapsule ground test article processing were effective in\nproviding lessons learned and valuable insights into various\nhandling options of the four components which were\nperformed and simulated during dozens of motion capture\nscenarios.\n2. Having a lower stature technician perform the\ninstallation/removals closer to their bodies, offers less\nstrains caused by bending on the back and legs, compared to\nthe taller stature technician performing the same tasks.\n3. The use of additional removable platforms in the\nCM are not recommended since these platforms would limit\naccess and not enhance the postures.\n4. Labeling of the platforms is recommended to assure\nproper positioning.\n5. Non-protruding and non-interfering handholds would\nalso provide benefits to handling the platforms within the\nconfined environment.\n6. Dimensions and thickness would be affected by\nmaneuverability through the Side Hatch and interfaces with\nthe CM.\n7. Flexibility in horizontal platform maneuvering within\nthe CM is also recommended in planning platform\nconstruction.\n8. Having adjacent platforms installed for the Guiding\nand quality technician allow increased visibility and\nhandling for their roles and provide additional staging\nsurfaces.\n9. Operations should afford the technicians the\nopportunity to take frequent stretching breaks during the\ntask to increase circulation and rest stressed, fatigued\nmuscles after holding postures static.\n10. Foam padding should be used where practical,\nespecially during long duration jobs, to minimize contact\nstress to tissues and muscles and to increase technician\ncomfort in performing the installation and removal tasks.\n\nFigure 14 Designing Box Locations and Ground Support\nEquipment\nAnother study simulated the avionics box and avionics\nshelf configuration in a biomechanics laboratory at the\nUniversity of Miami. [7] This study looked at lifting time,\nhow close the box can be placed on target, the EMG muscle\nactivity, and the forces to the L5/S I. The lifts were manually\ndone with restrictions or no restrictions to the installed box\nwith three different box weights, and two shelf heights. See\nFigure -15\n\n8. FURTHER STUDIES AND FUTURE PLANS\n8.i Further Studies for Avionics Box instal/ation\nPlans are to perform further studies to evaluate\ncomponent configuration with the cavities, assessing fine\nmotor and detail handling tasks. This assessment would\nevaluate components placed in exact locations to determine\nFeasibility of Hand/Arm Workspaces, Detailed Handling,\nFine Motor Tasks (Hand/tool grasp), Collision Detection\n(Component placement within cavity), Visibility (Around\ncomponents in cavities), and Detailed Reach (Inside\ncavities).\n\nFigure 15 University Study\n7\n\n8./ Future Plans\n\nProvide the state-of-art biomechanical capabilities to\ndesign flight hardware to ensure safe and efficient ground,\nflight, and terrestrial processing of future space systems.\nImprove the HEMAP capabilities to satisfy NASAs\nneed for Research and Technology by partnering with and\nincorporating NASA, academia, and commercial state of art\ncapabilities, methods, and expertise.\n\nBIOGRAPHIES\n\nDamon Stambolian is currently working on a\nPhD in Industrial Engineering focusing his\nresearch on Biomechanics at the University of\nMiami\'s Biomechanics Laboratory.
