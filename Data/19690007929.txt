One standard\n620\nmission at the high bit rate of 1 , 0 bits-per-second and backup mission at 27Q bits-per-second, U s e of the high bit rate is\ndependent on the condition of the spacecraft and availability of\nthe highly sensitive 210-foot diameter antenna at Goldstone,\n\nThe back-up afssion is automatic and can be executed without commands from Earth. The standard mission is automatic\nwith the exception of sending execute commands for the back-up\nmiSS;bOn*\n\nBoth plans can be changed by re-programming the computer\nby Earth command.\n\nAt sepaaaation from the Centaur stage the spacecraft\'s altitude control system ispowered, primary and secondary Sun seniors are activated and the Sun acquisition sequence is initiated.\nIn addition, the Central Computer and Sequencer is enabled, the\npyrotechnic subsystem is armed f o r deployment of the solar\npanels, the Canopus sensor is turned on and the tape recorders\nare StQpped. The latter run during launch to keep tension on\nthe tapes to prevent free-running and snarling,\nSun acqufsition will be accomplished approximately 30\nminute8 aftes separation from the Centaur, Canopus acquisition\nwill be cornpletedl one to four hours after separation, Canopus\nis acquired by solling the spacecraft which sweeps the Canopus\nsensor through a complete circle. The sensor will ignore light\nsources in ranges below or beyond the intensity of Canopus,\nHowever, in the event of a lock-on to a light source other than\nCanopus, an override comand can be sent from Earth.\n-=more-\n\n-6Each spacecraft has the capability of performing two midcourse corrections. Under noma1 launch conditions spacecraft\nF may require two, c3 will require one. F may require two corrections primarily because of the longer flight time of the\nearly launch. The longer trajectory is more sensitive to midcourse errors. The first midcourse of F w i l l occur between\nfive and fifteen days after the launch, the second between\nlaunch plus one to five months. The first midcourse for G\nwill be at about launch plus five days,\nThe maneuver sequence begins with transmission to the\nspacecraft of commands giving the direction and amount of a\npitch turn and a roll turn and the time of motor burn, These\nare stored in the Central Computer and Sequencer until an execute cormnand is sent. The maneuver is controlled by the CC&S\nwhich can command a maneuver abort if the turns are not performed according t o instruotiona. Earth command can also abort\nthe maneuver,\nApproximately 8+ minutes after the pitch and roll turns\nare completed the CCBCS will command firing of the midcourse\nmotors. The CC&S will count the required thrust time and then\ncommand the engine off. The necessary internal commands are\nthen given for reacquisition of the Sun and Canopus.\n\nA period of tracking is required to determine the accuracy\nof the maneuver, However, telemetry at the t h e of the maneuver\nwill give an estimate of accuracy,\nThe spacecraft is then returned to the cruise mode until\neither second midcourse or Mars encounter, The bit rate during\ncruise will be either 8 l/3 or 33 l/3 bits-per-second depending\non the telecommunications performance, The rate is changed by\nground command.\nThe basic encounter phases are far-encounter, nearencounter, occultation and playback.\nIn the standard mission far-encounter will begin at encounter minus 48 hours for spacecraft F and minus 72 hours for\nG Encounter (E) is defined as the point of closest approach\n.\nas the spacecraft passes Mars.\n\nIn the standard plan spacecraft F will take 50 approach\npictures and spacecraft G 91 approach pictures. Playback will\n620\nbe at the high bit rate of 1 , 0 bits-per-second before the\nf\nfly-by, I it is not possible to follow the standard plan the\nCC&S will automatically command a sequence of eight approach\npictures beginning at about E-21 hours and ending at about E-12\nhours for both spacecraft.

At the ppoper time the scan platform\nis commanded to the far-encounter position and the far-encounter\nplanet sensor I s turned on. The scan platform control system\nwill switch to automatic tracking when the planet i s acquired\nby the sensor. The far-encounter TV sequence begins with pictures from Camera B only being recorded on the analog tape recorder at required intervals of time for each spacecraft.\nA l l the science instsunnents except the infrared spectrometer take data during this phase but, as the digital recorder\ni s not yet in operation, the non-TV data is not recorded. However, selected portions of the data are transmitted as acquired,\n\nNear-encounter will begin at the end of the approach picture sequence, The far-encounter planet sensor I s disabled t o\ninsure that the scan platform a 1 1 not automatically track during this phase and the platform is commanded to the nearencounter position.\nPrior to near-encounter two planet sensors are turned on.\n"Planet-in-View" signals from the sensors w i l l start the recording of data when preceded by a start command from the CC&S\no r from Earth.\nThe analog tape recorder, storing TV data only, w i l l be\nstopped at about the time the scan crosses Into the night side\nof Mars or E plus three minutes.

For example, the flight\ntime must not exceed certain limits imposed by the lifetlme of\nthe spacecraft; injection velocities are prescribed by the capability of the boost vehicle, thus affecting the transit time;\nan adequate launch period must be provided; communication distances must not be excessive; arrival at Mars must be properly\ntimed to coincide with those regions of maxlmum interest for\nscientific viewing; and encounter is designed to occur during\nthe viewing period of Goldstone, the Mojave Desert station of\nthe Deep Space Network,\nOther factors influencing Interplanetary trajectories\ninclude the effect of solar wind pressure on the flight path\nas well as the gravitational attraction of Sun, Earth, Mars,\nMercury, Venus and Jupiter.\n\nIn selecting an a3ming zone that will determine the path\nof the spacecraft as it passes Mars, the trajectory engineer\nmust satisfy the many and sometimes conflicting requirements\nof the scientific experiments of the mission, for example, insure spacecraft occultation by Mars. It is also required to\nassure that the Mariner w i l l not -pact Mars, in order to prevent contamination of the planet by Earth microorganisms,\n\n-more\n\n-\n\nE\n\nw\n\n-10-\n\nThe accuracy of the encounter with Mars will be influenced\nby launch accuracy, radio tracking accuracy, flight path calculation accuracy, and the midcourse correction accuracy,\nCalculations after launch will determine if the flight\npath of the spacecraft is within the correction capability of\nthe midcourse motor. Mariner has the capability of performing\ntwo midcourse corrections in the event the first does not yield\nthe desired accuracy for encounter.\nThe accuracies demanded by the launch vehicle and by the\nmidcourse motor c a n be illustrated by the following numbers.\nThe injectSon velocity can vary only by plus or minus 40 milesper-hour or the resulting trajectory will not be within the\ncorrection capability of the midcourse motor..

In\nairless space, the temperature differential between the sunlit\nside and the shaded side of an object can be several hundred\ndegrees.\nHeating by direct sunlight on the Mariner spacecraft I s\nminimized by the use of a thermal shield on its Sun side. The\nside away from the Sun is covered with a thermal shield to prevent rapid loss of heat to the cold of space,\nThe top of Mariner\'s basic octagon is insulated from the\nSun by a multi-layered shield of aluminized Teflon mounted to\nthe high-gain antenna support structure. The bottom is enclosed\nby a similar shield, or space \'blanket," to retain heat generated\nby power consumption within the spacecraft.\nTemperature control of six of the electronics compartments\nis provided by polished metal louvers actuated by coiled bimetallic strips. The strips act as spiral-wound springs that\nexpand and contract as they heat and cool. This mechanical\naction, which opens and closes the louvers, is calibrated to\nprovide an operating range from f u l l y closed at 55 degrees F\n.\nto fully open at 90 degrees F A louver assembly consists of\n.\n22 horizontal louvers driven in pairs by 11 actuators. Each\npair operates independently on its own locab temperature determined by internal power dissipation,\nThe science platform and its array of instruments at the\nbottom of the octagon is covered by a third thermal blanket\nfitted also wlth a louver assembly, The platform is designed\nto be thermally isolated from the main equipment octagon by 8\nplastic collar on the attaching support tube, Temperature control is achieved by electrical dissipation in heaters and in\nthe instruments themselves,\nElectric heaters are located wkthin the science platform\net and in two of the elec$ronics bays to provide additional\nng certain portions of the mission.\n\n-30-\n\nPaint patterns and polished metal surfaces are used on\nthe Mariner for passive control of temperatures outside of the\nprotected octagon and covered science platform. These surfaces\ncontrol both the amount of heat dissipated into space and the\namount of solar heat absorbed or reflected away. T e patterns\nh\nwere determined frm testing a Temperature Control Model (TCM)\nof the spacecraft in a space simulation chamber at JPL and from\nthe application of actual mission data acquired during the 196465 MarAner IV mission to Mars.\n\nThe high-gain antenna dish, which i s dependent upon the\nSun for its surface heat, is painted green to keep it at near\nroom temperature during planet encounter but within its upper\nthermal limit earlier in the mission,\nA tempera~urecontrol flux monitor ( T C ~will perfam an\nengineering experiment by comparing actual f1 ght thermal performance with that determined by space-simulated t e s t s .

The TCFM will make an absolute mea.\nsurement o f the solar Zntensity to within plus or minus 1 5\npercent\n\n1\n\n-31-\n\nMidcourse Propulsion\nMariner\'s midcourse rocket engine used a liquid monopropellant and is capable of: firing twice during the Mars\nmission. Ita function is to provide small trajectory corrections to the spacecraft. The engine uses anhydrous hydrazine\nas the propellant and a spontaneous catalyst for decomposition\nof the hydrazine.\nThe rocket nozzle protrudes from one of the eight sides of\nMariner\'s octagonal base below and between two of the solar\npanels, The engine\'s direction of thrust is nearly parallel to\nthe panels, hence perpendicular to the longitudinal or roll axis\nof the spacecraft.\nHydrazine is contained in a ribber bladder enclosed in a\nspherical pressure vessel. The propellant is forced into the\ncombustion chamber by nitrogen gas compressing the bladder. Decomposition of the hydrazine, maintained by the catalyst stored\nin the chamber, causes the rapid expansion of hot gases in the\nengine.\nFiring of the engine is controlled by the Central Computer\nand Sequencer, which receives the time, direction and duration\nof required thrust through the ground-to-spacecraft communications link. At the command signal from the CC&S, explosivelyactuated valves allow pressure-regulated nitrogen gas to enter\nthe propellant tank and open the propellant line to the engine,\nFor termination of thrust, the CC&S timer actuates another set\nof valves which stops propellant flow and tank pressurization.\nDuring rocket engine firing, spacecraft attitude is maintained\nby autopilot-controlled jet vanes positioned in the rocket\nnozzle to deflect the engine exhaust stream,\nRestart capability and redundancy are provided by second\nsets of explosive start and shutoff valves.\nEither of the two Mariners may perform one or two midcourse\nt\nmaneuvers. I is anticipated, because of several trajectory\nfactors, that the f i r s t spacecraft launched probably will require\na second maneuver while the second Mariner will not.\nFirst maneuver for each spacecraft is expected to occur\nwithin five to 15 days following each Launch. A second maneuver\nwould be condueted about one to four months after launch.\n\n-32-\n\nThe midcourse propulsion system can burn for as little\nas 100 milliseconds and can alter velocity i n any direction\nfrom less than mile-per-hour to 134 miles-per-hour. Maximum burn time is 102 seconds. Thrust is continuous at about\n51.3 pounds.\nLaunch weight of t h e midcourse propulsion system, including the gas pressurant and 214 pounds of propellant, is\n47 pounds.\n\n-more-\n\n-33Communications\nTwo-way communications with the Mariners will be\naccomplished with a radio link between Earth tracking stations and a dual transmitter-single receiver radio system\naboard each spacecraft,\nThe on-board communications system also includes a telemetry subsystem, command subsystem, data storage subsystem and\nhigh and low-gain antennas,\n\nThe spacecraft S-band receiver w i l l operate continuously\nduring the mission at about 2115 megacycles. (The receivers\nin the t w o Mariners will operate at slightly different frequencies. Similarly, no two transmitters will operate at exactly the same frequency.) The receiver will be used with only\none antenna\nthe low-gain omnl-directional antenna. It receives uplink command and ranging signals from ground stations\nsf the Deep Space Network.\n\n--\n\nTo provide the standard Doppler tracking data, the radio\nsignal transmltted from Earth is received at the spacecraft,\nchanged in frequency by a known ratio and re-transmitted to\nEarth. In addition, a JPL-developed ranging technique wing\nan automatic coded signal provides range measurement8 with an\naccuracy of a few yards at the Mars-Earth dlstance. The ranging\nfunction may be commanded on and off by ground command.\nWhen no uplink signal is being received by Mariner, the\ntransmitted frequency of about 2195 megacycles opiginatas in\nthe spacecraft transmitter, The tranesmitter consists of two\nredundant exciters and two redundant radio frequency power\namplifiers of which any combination is poasible. Only one\nexciter-amplifier comb1na;tion w i l l operate at any one tlme.\nSelection of the combination will be by on-board failure detection logic with ground command backup.\nBoth amplifiers on each spacecraft employ traveling wave\ntubes and are capable of operating at 1 watts or 20 watts\n0\noutput and the signal may be transmitted through either the\nhigh-gain or low-galn antenna. Transmission via the high-gain\nantenna will be required durlng the encounter and playback\nphases of the mission.\nThe low-gain antenna provides essentially uniform coverage\nin the forward hemisphere of the spacecraft.

The sensors are light-sensitive diodes which inform\nthe attitude control system when they see the Sun. The attitude control system responds to these signals by turning the\nspacecraft and pointing the solar panels toward the Sun for\nstabilization on two axes and for conversion of solar energy\nto spacecraft power, Nitrogen.gas escapes through the appropriate jet nozzle, imparting a reaction to the spacecraft to\ncorrect its angular position.\n\n7\n\nThe star Canopuz39 one of the bri htest in the gala\nwill\nprovide a second celestial reference along with the Sun upon\nwhich to base the midcourse maneuver. The Canopus sensor will\nactivate the gas jets to roll the spacecraft about the alreadyfixed longitudinal or roll axis until it is "locked" in cruise\nposition, Canopus acquisition occurs when the light intensity\nin the field of view of the sensor matches the intensity anticipated for the star Canopus. Brightness of the SensIor\'s target star will be telemetered to the ground to verify the correct\nstar has been acquired,\n\n7\n\nThe Canopus sensor design incorporates the capability of\npreventing recurring loss of roll reference caused by bright\nparticles in the sensor field of view, The sensor logic will\nallow a bright fast-moving particle to drift through the field\nof view without causing the Spacecraft to initiate a new roll\nsearch for the star.\nPeriodically durlng the flight, the Canopus sensor will\nbe updated to compensate for the changing angular relationship\nbetween the spacecraft and the star. The sensor\'s field of\nview or "look angle" will be changed electronically to follow\nCanopus throughout the mission. The update, which will occur\nfour times at approximately three-week to four-week intervals,\nwill be commanded at predetermined times by the on-board Central Computer and Sequencer with ground command backup. A\nfifth Canopus tracker update will occur about 30 days after the\nspacecraft flies by Mars.\nUpon receipt of commands from the CC&S, the attitude control system orients the spacecraft to align the thrust axis of\nthe midcourse motor in the direction required for the trajectory correction maneuver.\nDuring firing of the mldcourse motor, stabilization of\nthe spacecraft will be effected by the use of four mdder-like\njet vanes mounted in the downstream end of the engine nozzle.\nThe Harinerrs autopilot controls spacecraft attitude during\nengine firing by using the gyros to sense motion about the\nspacecraft\'s three axes for positioning the Jet vanes.\n\n-\n\n-more\n\n-37Each vane has its o m separate control system and, because\nthe midcourse motor is not mounted along aqy of the three axes,\neach is activated by a mixture of signals from the three gyros.\nConstant adjustment of the angles of the jet vanes ensures that\nthe motor thrust direction remains through the spacecraft\'s center of gravity.\n\nScan Control\n\nMariner\'s science instruments are mounted on a scan platform which can be rotated about two axes to point the instruments toward Mars during the spacecraft\'s approach and passage\nof the planet. The platform is located below the octagonal base\nof the spacecraft.\nThe instruments are the ultraviolet spectrometer, infrared\nradiometer, infrared spectrometer, wide-angle television camera\nand narrow-angle television camera. A l s o located on the platform are three planet sensors and two high pressure spheres containrng hydrogen and nitrogen for cooling a detector in the IR\nspectrometer.\nThe scan control system allows multiple pointing directions\nof the instruments as the encounter phase of the mission progresses.\nThe platform\'s two axes of rotation are described as the clock\nangle motion about the axis of the tube extending vertically from\nthe octagon and cone angle motion about an axis which is\nhorizontal.\n\nThe I67-pound platform is motor driven and moves 215 degrees\nin the clock and 64 degrees in cone,\nAs Mariner approaches Mars (about three days before closest\napproach), one of the scan control system\'s three optical sensing\nthe far encounter planet sensor\ntracks the center\ndevices\nof brightness of Mars enabling the narrow-angle TV camepa to begin a series of full-disk pictures of the planet.\n\n--\n\n0-\n\nThe other planet sensors, called narrow-angle M r gates,\nas\ninitiate several science events during the near encounter portion\nof the mission. One of the sensors provides a signal which activates the cyrogenic cooldown of the detector in the IR spectrometer. The second provides the information initiating the recording of instrument data.\nAt about 12 hours before Mariner\'s closest approach to\nMars, the scan platform twists on both axes to a pointing angle\nset before launch or updated during the flight by ground command.\n\n-more-\n\n-38-\n\nData Automation Subsystem\nThe f i v e s c i e n t i f i c instruments on t h e s p a c e c r a f t are\nc o n t r o l l e d and synchronized by t h e Data Automation Subsystem\n(DAS) and t h e data from t h e instruments i s converted by the\nDAS i n t o a s u i t a b l e d i g i t a l form f o r t r a n s m i t t a l t o Earth.\n\nThe experiments c o n t r o l l e d by t h e DAS are t e l e v i s i o n ,\ni n f r a r e d radiometer, i n f r a r e d spectrometer and u l t r a v i o l e t\nspectrometer.
