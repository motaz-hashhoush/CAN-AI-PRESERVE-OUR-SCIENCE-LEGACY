b'(GLONASS)\nand\nthe\nproposed\nEuropean Galileo system.\nThis remote-sensing system offers\nboth advantages and disadvantages\nover traditional radar altimeters: One\nadvantage of GPS-reflection systems is\nthat they cost less because there is no\nneed to transmit signals. Another advantage is that there are more simultaneous\nmeasurement opportunities \xe2\x80\x94 one for\neach GPS satellite in view. The primary\ndisadvantage is that in comparison with\nradar signals, GPS signals are weaker,\nnecessitating larger antennas and/or\nlonger observations.\nThis GPS-reflection remote-sensing\nsystem was tested in aircraft and made\nto record and process both (1) signals\ncoming directly from GPS satellites by\nmeans of an upward-looking antenna\nand (2) GPS signals reflected from the\nground by means of a downward-looking antenna. In addition to performing\nconventional GPS processing, the system records raw signals for postprocessing as required.\nThe figure schematically depicts the airborne equipment part of the present system. Four synchronized GPS receiver front\nends, each connected to a separate antenna, sample the complex (in-phase and\nquadrature) GPS L1 (1,575.42 MHz) and\nL2 (1,227.6) signals at a rate of 20.456\nMHz. The sampling clock in one receiver\nfront end is used as a master clock for synchronizing all four receivers and two digital\ndata recorders. The raw samples are fed\nthrough the digital data recorders for storage on two 300-GB arrays of hard disks.\nSubsequently, the digitized samples are\nprocessed by software that performs functions similar to those of GPS hardware\nreceivers, plus additional processing of the\nreflected signals.\nWhereas prior such systems have utilized the delay information in the GPS\nsignals, this system also utilizes the\nDoppler shifts of the signals to increase\n\nGPS Receiver\nFront End\nDigital\nData\nRecorder\n\n300-GB\nDisk Array\n\nDigital\nData\nRecorder\n\n300-GB\nDisk Array\n\nGPS Receiver\nFront End\n\nGPS Receiver\nFront End\n\nGPS Receiver\nFront End\n\nThis Airborne Subsystem samples direct and reflected GPS signals and records the resulting\ndata.

The system offers\n160 to 320 times the data-collection\nbandwidth of prior GPS-reflection\nremote-sensing systems. Moreover,\nunlike other such systems that do not\nhave reprocessing capability, this system affords much greater flexibility\nbecause it can be made to reprocess\nthe recorded signal data at will.\nThe software signal-processing functions in this system include detection of\nsignals; tracking of phases and delays;\nmapping of delay, Doppler, and delay/\nDoppler waveforms; dual-frequency (L1\nand L2) processing; coherent integrations as short as 125 \xc2\xb5s; decoding of\nnavigation messages; and precise time\ntagging of observable quantities. The\nsoftware can perform these functions on\nall detectable satellite signals without\ndead time. Custom signal-processing\n\nfeatures can easily be included: For\nexample, in principle, data collected\nover the ocean by this system can be\nprocessed to extract mean sea height,\nwind speed and direction, and significant wave height; data collected over\nland can be processed to extract measures of soil moisture and biomass; and\ndata collected over ice can be\nprocessed to obtain estimates of the ice\nage, thickness, and surface density.\nThis work was done by Stephen\nLowe, Peter Kroger, Garth Franklin,\nJohn LaBrecque, Jesse Lerma, Michael\nLough,\nMartin\nMarcin,\nRonald\nMuellerschoen, Donovan Spitzmesser,\nand Lawrence Young of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, access the\nTechnical Support Package (TSP) free\non-line at www.nasatech.com.\nNPO-30385\n\nLadar System Identifies Obstacles Partly Hidden by Grass\nA robot moving cross country (e.g., an agricultural\nrobot) could avoid obstacles.\nA ladar-based system now undergoing development is intended to enable\nan autonomous mobile robot in an outdoor environment to avoid moving\ntoward trees, large rocks, and other\nobstacles that are partly hidden by tall\ngrass. The design of the system incor16\n\nporates the assumption that the robot is\ncapable of moving through grass and\nprovides for discrimination between\ngrass and obstacles on the basis of\ngeometric properties extracted from\nladar readings as described below.\nThe system (see figure) includes a\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory,\nPasadena, California\nladar system that projects a range-measuring pulsed laser beam that has a\nsmall angular width of \xe2\x88\x86 radians and is\ncapable of measuring distances of reflective objects from a minimum of dmin to a\nmaximum of dmax. The system is\nequipped with a rotating mirror that\nNASA Tech Briefs, January 2003\n\n\xcf\x88\n\neach scan, the laser beam is fired at relatively small angular intervals of \xce\xb8 radians\nto make range measurements, so that\nthe total number of range measurements\nacquired in a scan is Ne = \xe2\x84\xa6/\xce\xb8.\n\nThe basic ladar output data for each\nscan consist of a range measurement\nfor each of the Ne angular intervals.\nThese data are processed by an algorithm that classifies objects as either\nfoliage (that is, grass stalks) or not\nfoliage (that is, obstacles). Objects to\nwhich the algorithm cannot assign the\nclassification \xe2\x80\x9cfoliage\xe2\x80\x9d with a sufficiently\nhigh degree of confidence are conservatively classified as \xe2\x80\x9cnot foliage\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure\navoidance of obstacles.\nThe classification is made on the basis\nof three locality principles that are here\ndescribed by reference to object A at\nscan angle \xce\xb2 in the figure. The first principle is one of locality in both space and\ntime: If A is an obstacle and is found at\nangle \xce\xb2 at time t, then it will be found at\nan angle near \xce\xb2 at time t + \xcf\x84. The second principle is that if A is an obstacle, it\nmust subtend a substantial angle \xcf\x88 and\nall laser-beam directions that intersect A\nmust lie within the angular range \xce\xb2\xc2\xb1\xcf\x88.\nThe third principle is one of spatial locality of the gaps between grass stalks that\nenable the laser beam to penetrate the\nfoliage and reach object A: If the laser\nbeam penetrates the foliage and hits A\nwhen aimed at angle \xce\xb2, then it is also\nlikely to do so when aimed at angle \xce\xb2\xc2\xb1\xe2\x88\x86.\nThese locality principles hold for any\ncombination of motions of the robot and\nthe obstacles, as long as the angular\nsampling interval (\xce\xb8) and the time\nbetween consecutive scans (\xcf\x84) are sufficiently small.\nThis work was done by Andres\nCastano of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.
