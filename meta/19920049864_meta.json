TOVS data have been used successfully for delineating synoptic and subsynoptic systems, since they provide the vertical temperature structure of the atmosphere; SSM/I observations have proved valuable for analyzing storms through water vapor and rain determinations. These positive results prompted simultaneous analysis of TOVS and SSM/I observations obtained during a cold air outbreak over the Norwegian Sea. After a description of the instruments and the retrieval schemes, the mutually supporting information from these two independent instruments is discussed. Implications for the monitoring of polar lows are presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "44A", "submissionId": 19920049864, "issn": "0280-6495", "id": "34705a106fbf4b59adc9daebda38711d", "publicationName": "Tellus, Series A - Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography", "publicationDate": "1992-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
