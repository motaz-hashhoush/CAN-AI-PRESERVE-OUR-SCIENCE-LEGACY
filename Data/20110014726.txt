Refer to NPO-40463.\n\nParallel Adaptive Mesh\nRefinement Library\nParallel Adaptive Mesh Refinement\nLibrary (PARAMESH) is a package of\nFortran 90 subroutines designed to provide a computer programmer with an\neasy route to extension of (1) a previously written serial code that uses a logically Cartesian structured mesh into (2)\na parallel code with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Alternatively, in its\nsimplest use, and with minimal effort,\nPARAMESH can operate as a domaindecomposition tool for users who want\nto parallelize their serial codes but who\ndo not wish to utilize adaptivity. The\npackage builds a hierarchy of sub-grids\nto cover the computational domain of a\ngiven application program, with spatial\nresolution varying to satisfy the demands\nof the application. The sub-grid blocks\nform the nodes of a tree data structure\n(a quad-tree in two or an oct-tree in\nthree dimensions). Each grid block has\na logically Cartesian mesh. The package\nsupports one-, two- and three-dimensional models.\nThis program was written by Peter MacNeice of Raytheon/STX and Kevin Olson of\nGeorge Mason University for Goddard Space\nFlight Center.

(A general\ndescription of Web services is available\nat http://www.w3.org/ and in many current software-engineering texts and articles focused on distributed programming.) The SPDF Web services\ndistributed programming interface enables additional collaboration and inte-\n\n16\n\ngration of the SPDF software system\nwith other software systems, in furtherance of the SPDF mission to lead collaborative efforts in the collection and utilization of space physics data and\nmathematical models. This programming interface conforms to all applicable Web services specifications of the\nWorld Wide Web Consortium. The interface is specified by a Web Services\nDescription Language (WSDL) file. The\nSPDF Web services software consists of\nthe following components:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A server program for implementation\nof the Web services; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A software developer\xe2\x80\x99s kit that consists\nof a WSDL file, a less formal description of the interface, a Java class library (which further eases development of Java-based client software),\nand Java source code for an example\nclient program that illustrates the use\nof the interface.\nThis program was written by Robert M. Candey, Bernard T. Harris, and Reine A. Chimiak\nof Goddard Space Flight Center.

COMBUSTOR implements an empirical model of combustor\nnoise derived from correlations between\nengine-noise data and operational and\ngeometric parameters, and was developed from databases of measurements\nof acoustic emissions of engines.\nCNOISE implements an analytical and\ncomputational model of the propagation of combustor temperature fluctuations (hot spots) through downstream\nturbine stages. Such hot spots are known\nto give rise to far-field noise. CNOISE is\nexpected to be helpful in determining\nwhy low-emission combustors are sometimes noisier than older ones, to provide\nguidance for refining the empirical correlation model embodied in the COMBUSTOR code, and to provide insight\non how to vary downstream turbinestage geometry to reduce the contribution of hot spots to far-field noise.\n\nThese programs were written by P. Gliebe, R.\nMani, S. Salamah, and R. Coffin of General\nElectric Co. and Jayesh Mehta of Diversitec, Inc.,\nfor Glenn Research Center.

TIPSOD utilizes the programming interface of the Satellite Situation\nCenter Web (SSCWeb) services to communicate with the SSC logic and database by use of the open protocols of the\nInternet. TIPSOD is implemented in Java\n3D and effects an extension of the preexisting SSCWeb two-dimensional static\ngraphical displays of orbits. Orbits can be\ndisplayed in any or all of the following\nseven reference systems: true-of-date (an\ninertial system), J2000 (another inertial\nsystem), geographic, geomagnetic, geocentric solar ecliptic, geocentric solar\nmagnetospheric, and solar magnetic. In\naddition to orbits, TIPSOD computes\nand displays Sibeck\xe2\x80\x99s magnetopause and\nFairfield\xe2\x80\x99s bow-shock surfaces. TIPSOD\ncan be used by the scientific community\nas a means of projection or interpretation. It also has potential as an educational tool.
