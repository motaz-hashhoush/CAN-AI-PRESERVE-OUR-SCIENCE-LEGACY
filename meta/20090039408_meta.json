Meanwhile, a small Hialeah, Florida-based business, PolyuMAC Inc., was looking for advanced foams to use in the customized manufacturing of acoustical and thermal insulation. The company contacted NASA, licensed the material, and then the original inventors worked with the company's engineers to make a new material that was better for both parties. The new version, a high performance, flame retardant, flexible polyimide foam, is used for insulating NASA cryogenic propellant tanks and shows promise for use on watercraft, aircraft, spacecraft, electronics and electrical products, automobiles and automotive products, recreation equipment, and building and construction materials.", "title": "Insulating Foams Save Money, Increase Safety", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T19:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20090039408, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090039408, "id": "7c060a27229c42cb917cc374487cea85", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2009", "publicationDate": "2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090039408.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090039408/downloads/20090039408.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090039408/downloads/20090039408.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090039408/downloads/20090039408.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
