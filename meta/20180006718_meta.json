The presence of humans aboard the station provides a foundation for numerous educational activities aimed at capturing interest and motivating children towards the study of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Projects such as the Amateur Radio on International Space Station (ARISS); Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students (EarthKAM); and Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Zero Robotics competition, among others, have allowed for global student, teacher and public access to space through student image acquisition and radio contacts with crew members. Projects like these and their accompanying educational materials are distributed to students around the world. Through the continued use of the station, we will challenge and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, writers, artists, politicians and explorers.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Chile", "submissionId": 20180006718, "endDate": "2018-07-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Mouvement International pour le Loisir Scientifique et Technique (MILSET)", "location": "Latin America"}}, "meetingId": "e77399179a1d42e097ccb25b6d08f24f", "id": "2f565b4c119847c0bd4fd9c5a5c9097e"}], "name": "Expo-Sciences Latin America 2018", "location": "Antofagasta", "id": "e77399179a1d42e097ccb25b6d08f24f", "startDate": "2018-07-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180006718, "id": "47a17bee1f4c461c8fbc64d1a5d6aac1", "publicationDate": "2018-07-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180006718.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180006718/downloads/20180006718.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180006718/downloads/20180006718.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180006718/downloads/20180006718.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
