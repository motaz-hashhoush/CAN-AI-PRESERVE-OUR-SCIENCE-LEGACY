The Satellite Telemetry and Return Link (STARLink) is an innovative approach for providing real-time data from existing experiments and allows for highly interactive future experiment systems on the ER-2. The concept involves placing an advanced wideband data link system on the ER-2 (and future NASA aircraft) for communicating to the NASA Tracking Data and Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) and its designated ground station. The emphasis is on providing full duplex real-time data between the ground station hub (and its remote nodes) and the on board experiments, allowing real-time processing and alteration to the experiments. This paper defines the concept, goals, multiplexing and data transmission system architecture, current capabilities, and future plans of the STARLink and its ability to provide a distributed interactive gateway node between the aircraft and various scientific centers worldwide.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "cui": {}, "meetings": [{"country": "CA", "submissionId": 19960022498, "endDate": "1995-06-08T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "a0838d6f636c52738d35362022672588", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Communications Research Centre Canada", "location": "Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"}}, "meetingId": "f2140f80548f43cd9fba06075a797a81", "id": "e52f6b0557944c24b3eadfac83ba9854"}, {"organizationId": "f93929fef1eb5d9bb0bc1f566ba28e6f", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab", "location": "La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, California, United States"}}, "meetingId": "f2140f80548f43cd9fba06075a797a81", "id": "5baec182795c4bb0b870a147f01e882e"}], "name": "4th International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1995)", "location": "Ottawa", "id": "f2140f80548f43cd9fba06075a797a81", "startDate": "1995-06-06T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960022498, "isbn": "9780662230281", "publisher": "Communications Research Centre Canada", "id": "b2117ec510bb4697bf6d570f1d418ea6", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the Fourth International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1995)", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "issuePublicationDate": "1995-01-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19960022452, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings of the Fourth International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1995)", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
