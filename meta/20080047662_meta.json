The team will be showing pictures of low fidelity, simplified ISS models, but no dimensions or technical data. The presentation will include a brief description of the contract and task, description and picture of the Topology, description of Generic Ground Rules and Constraints (GGR&C), description of Stage Analysis with constraints applied, and wrap up with description of other tasks such as Special Studies, Cable Routing, etc. The models include conceptual Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Lunar Lander images and animations created for promotional purposes, which are based entirely on public domain conceptual images from public NASA web sites and publicly available magazine articles and are not based on any actual designs, measurements, or 3D models. Conceptual Mars rover and lander are completely conceptual and are not based on any NASA designs or data. The demonstration includes High Fidelity Computer Aided Design (CAD) models of ISS provided by the ISS 3D CAD Team which will be used in a visual display to demonstrate the capabilities of the Teamcenter Visualization software. The demonstration will include 3D views of the CAD models including random measurements that will be taken to demonstrate the measurement tool. A 3D PDF file will be demonstrated of the Blue Book fidelity assembly complete model with no vehicles attached. The 3D zoom and rotation will be displayed as well as random measurements from the measurement tool. The External Configuration Analysis and Tracking Tool (ExCATT) Microsoft Access Database will be demonstrated to show its capabilities to organize and track hardware on ISS. The data included will be part numbers, serial numbers, historical, current, and future locations, of external hardware components on station. It includes dates of all external ISS events and flights and the associated hardware changes for each event. The hardware location information does not always reveal the exact location of the hardware, only the general location. In some cases the location is a module or carrier, in other cases it is a WIF socket, handrail, or attach point. Only small portions of the data will be displayed for demonstration purposes.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20080047662, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Booz-Allen and Hamilton, Inc.", "location": "San Antonio, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "14c57a3629934933ba66d166471ca1a5", "id": "8f6be24610e842ad84002efefe653ab7"}], "name": "BAH Texas 2008 Tech Day", "location": "San Antonio, TX", "id": "14c57a3629934933ba66d166471ca1a5", "startDate": "2008-11-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080047662, "id": "0d3c8a83739c42cc8a8e7896f2b81409", "publicationDate": "2008-10-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080047662.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080047662/downloads/20080047662.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080047662/downloads/20080047662.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080047662/downloads/20080047662.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
