It has\nbeen my great pleasure to have been associated with him for the\npast six years and, since I came late to the business of aeronautics, I had never had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Robert T.\nJones before. During the period that I have had the opportunity\nto work with him I have developed an enormous respect for his\ntechnical abilities and also for his character as a man. His\ngrasp of the physical sciences is as broad as that of anyone I\nknow. It ranges from practical aeronautical engineering to the\nmost advanced and abstruse statistical mechanics. What is more\nremarkable is that R. T.\'s understanding is not superficial.\nIn an amazingly short time R. T. can master a field to the point\nwhere he can make original contributions. R. T. is also an\nexcellent teacher. He has a profound influence on those around\nhim. In addition, his critical faculties are also exceedingly\nsharp. The Ames Research Center is indeed fortunate to count\nR. T. as one of us. He is unique and his work has added\ngreatly to the Center\'s scientific and technical reputation.\nIt is a genuine pleasure as well as an honor to have him here.\n\nHans Mark\nDirector\nAmes Research Center\n\nV\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe p u b l i c a t i o n of t h i s remarkable c o l l e c t i o n commemorates t h e 65th\nb i r t h d a y of a very remarkable man, D r . Robert Thomas Jones, Aeronautical Engin e e r , who f i r s t went t o work f o r NACA 41 y e a r s ago.

What s o r t of man is t h i s , whose career h a s been so long and\nwhose c o n t r i b u t i o n s have been s o many and so important?\nhim\n\n-\n\nThis question is, of course, a loaded one\nas many w i l l r e a l i z e who know\nf o r nothing about Bob Jones i s commonplace!\n\n-\n\nF i r s t , consider how he g o t i n t o a e r o n a u t i c s . A f a s c i n a t i o n w i t h a v i a t i o n\ni n t h e 1920\'s w a s , t o b e s u r e , commonplace among u s who w e r e schoolboys then.\nI n Macon, Missouri, where he l i v e d , young Bob read A e r o D i g e s t , t r e a s u r e d i t s\ncover p i c t u r e s of t h e a i r p l a n e s of t h e day, and pored over i t s t e c h n i c a l a r t i c l e s on performance e s t i m a t i o n , s t a b i l i t y and c o n t r o l , and stress a n a l y s i s .\nAssembling t h e s e and NACA Reports, h e began t h e design and c o n s t r u c t i o n of a\ns m a l l , motorcycle-engined a i r p l a n e , u p s t a i r s i n h i s house. An upusual highschool mathematics t e a c h e r , Iva Z. B u t l e r , helped him t o understand stress and\ns t r a i n , b u t high-school graduation intervened, t h e a i r p l a n e remained unfini s h e d , and Bob went o f f t o t h e University of Missouri i n 1927.\n\nBut t h e a v i a t i o n bug had b i t t e n him badly. H e discovered Walter D i e h l \' s\nfamous E n g i n e e r i n g Aerodynamics and found i t more e x c i t i n g t h a n t h e r e q u i r e d\ncourses of h i s freshman year. H e l e f t t h e u n i v e r s i t y a f t e r t h a t f i r s t year\nby working f o r Charles Fower\'s f l y i n g cirand e n t e r e d t h e a v i a t i o n i n d u s t r y\ncus, which flew Standard J-1 b i p l a n e s ; Bob c a r r i e d g a s o l i n e cans, patched wing\nt i p s , and w a s paid i n f l y i n g lessons!\n\n-\n\nI n about 1929, t h e r e w a s c o n s i d e r a b l e a c t i v i t y i n a v i a t i o n i n t h e United\nStates, i n c l u d i n g t h e Middle West. There w e r e names l i k e Alexander-Eaglerock,\nsome s t i l l around i n 1975 and o t h e r s\nBeech, Cessna, Travel-Air, and Wac0\nn e a r l y f o r g o t t e n . A g r e a t demand f o r a "family f l i v v e r of t h e air" w a s\nexpected. I n Marshall, Missouri, t h e Nicholas-Beazley Company began manufact u r e of t h e Barling NB 3, a s p o r t y , three-place, low-wing, c a n t i l e v e r monoplane. Bob, w i t h h i s h i g h l y p r a c t i c a l ( i f b r i e f ) background i n t h e f l y i n g\nc i r c u s and a good recommendation from Charles Fower, landed a job t h e r e . It\nw a s n o t , a t f i r s t , an engineering j o b , b u t young Jones made i t c l e a r t h a t t h e\nengineering o f f i c e w a s where he wanted t o b e - and when a vacancy suddenly\noccurred, t h e r e h e w a s ! Together w i t h t h e company\'s c h i e f engineer, Thomas\nKirkup, Bob applied D i e h l \' s aerodynamics, c a r r i e d o u t stress a n a l y s e s , and\nperformed ( l a t e i n t o t h e n i g h t ) s t a t i c tests t o f a i l u r e . But Nicholas-Beazley,\nw i t h many o t h e r s , w a s wiped o u t i n 1930 by t h e b u s i n e s s c o l l a p s e .\n\n-\n\nThe a v i a t i o n i n d u s t r y recovered l a t e r i n t h e \' ~ O \' S , and s u r e l y Bob\'s\neven t y p i c a l l y\nt o become an a i r c r a f t\nf i r s t j o b s had prepared him admirably\nmanufacturer o r chief engineer - another Glenn Martin, Donald Douglas, o r\nJohn K. Northrop. But whatever f a t e s c o n t r o l t h e d e s t i n i e s of a e r o n a u t i c a l\nengineers, w i t h o r without c o l l e g e degrees, had o t h e r p l a n s f o r Robert Jones.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nvii\n\nWhen Nicholas-Beazley folded, he returned home to study Glauert\'s AerofoiZ and\nAirscrew Theory and $funk\'s FundamentaZs of FZuid D y d e s for A i r c r a f t\nDesigners. His father was chairman of the local Democratic committee, and\nthis helped young Bob get a job running an elevator in the House Office Building in Washington, D.C. Surely the above-mentioned fates had a hand in this,\nfor the building was across the street from the Library of Congress. Bob paid\nvisits to Dr. Albert I?. Zahm, the Library\'s Director and once a member of the\nNACA. They must have talked about mathematics, for Bob decided to study that\nfield. He began with Hamilton\'s quaternions! And when a Congressman, Honorable David J. Lewis, went to Dr. Zahm to request instruction in mathematics\nand physics - the Congressman was 65 and had finished with law and government Dr. Zahm sent him to the bright elevator boy across the street. Bob taught\nthe Congressman algebra and calculus.\nAt about this time, Bob made another friend whose influence on his career\nwas tremendous: Dr. Max M Munk, who had left the NACA, set up an office in\n.\nWashington as consultant and patent attorney, and was giving evening courses\nat Catholic University. (He had also studied law, passed the bar exams, and\nlearned Russian.) When he discovered that the elevator boy had studied his\nbook, he suggested that he take his evening course - a graduate course. When\nBob said that he might not be prepared for it (a suggestion that\'was certainly\nnot characteristic of young B b ) Dr. Munk gave him a little oral exam and\no!,\nenrolled him. Bob took Munk\'s evening courses for about three years - vector\nanalysis, airfoil theory, and relativity theory - and drew upon this sound\nearly teaching throughout his career. Thus Bob is truly one of the "Prandtl\ngrandchildren" and an heir to that great tradition, with its deep, intuitive\nappreciation of the power of applied mathematics, without attraction to\nmathematics or mathematical elegance for its own sake.\nThe election of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1932) brought the Public Works\nAdministration, and PWA opened up emergency jobs at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. Dr. Zahm and Congressman Lewis saw Dr. George W. Lewis,\nNACA Head, and recommended Robert Jones for one of these jobs; Bob went to\nLangley, reporting to Carl J. Wenzinger, Charles Zimmerman, and Fred Weick, on\nt\na nine-month assignment as Scientific Aid. The fates had their way: I\nrequired a sequence of unlikely events and remarkable people, but Robert T.\nJones was embarked on a career in research in the NACA and under the supervision of some unusually capable bosses.\nNot surprisingly, ordinary linear differential equations was a subject\nmissing from Bob\'s informal educational background - although he did know the\nquaternions and had read Grassmann\'s AusdehnwzgsZehre and similar classics in\nthe original - so with Weick\'s and Zimmerman\'s guidance, he "learned by doing"\ndifferential equations. He published some of the earliest results of step-bystep solutions of the equations of airplane motion (obtained on desk calculating machines), such as the transient motions following abrupt, unit-step\ncontrol deflections and gusts. He recalls that he became a sort of local\nauthority on linearity after once calculating the transient motion following a\ntwo-unit step input, and comparing the results with unit-step results! He was\nalso one of the first to apply Heaviside\'s operators to problems of airplane\ndynamics.\nviii\n\nBut t h e nine-month temporary appointment w a s about t o expire. Bob\'s\nbosses, Fred Weick, and Henry Reid, D i r e c t o r of t h e Langley Laboratory, t r i e d\nt o a r r a n g e f o r him t o t a k e a C i v i l S e r v i c e exam so they could h i r e him perman e n t l y , b u t the C i v i l S e r v i c e r u l e s s p e c i f i e d a Bachelor\'s degree. Weick and\nReid then thought t o i s s u e a s p e c i a l C i v i l S e r v i c e e x a m t h a t would r e q u i r e\neverything t h a t Bob knew. I n due course a s p e c i a l C i v i l S e r v i c e examination\nw a s i s s u e d w i t h q u e s t i o n s on Hamilton\'s quaternions, o p e r a t i o n a l c a l c u l u s , airc r a f t s t a b i l i t y and c o n t r o l , wing theory, and a few o t h e r s u b j e c t s . To t h e\ns u r p r i s e of those a t Langley, a f e l l o w showed up who o f f e r e d t h i s e x o t i c comb i n a t i o n and a Bachelor\'s degree as w e l l . Weick assigned him t o Bob Jones,\nwho put him t o work. Bob f i n a l l y g o t a permanent appointment on a subprofess i o n a l grade. Some y e a r s l a t e r , when he approached t h e f i r s t p r o f e s s i o n a l\ngrade P-1, he again encountered t h e requirement f o r t h e Bachelor\'s degree.\nThis t i m e t h e NACA w a s more ingenious - t h e s t a t e d requirements f o r grade P-2\nd i d not mention any degree, so NACA promoted him d i r e c t l y t o t h a t grade!\nBy t h e t i m e World War I1 began, Bob had published important papers,\ni n c l u d i n g a most ingenious way t o f i n d t h e t r a n s i e n t l i f t on f i n i t e - s p a n wings\n(page 193).

Bob divided t h e troublesome paper i n two p a r t s , and t h e\nlow-aspect-ratio p a r t w a s published. NACA began experiments i n an e f f o r t t o\nconfirm t h e s t a r t l i n g conclusions of t h e simple-sweep theory. Before t h e\nexperiments w e r e completed, V. E.

JONES, Langley Field, Virginin\n(Received August 17, 1936)\n\nSUMMARY\nHE paper illustrates the application of matheniatical advances made in electricity and other branches\nto problems of airplane dynamics. The HeavisideUromwich methods of solution of linear differential\nequations are described and it is shown how these\nniethods avoid the consideration of boundary conditions\nand of particular or complementary integrals. It is\npointed out that if the solution of the differential equation is obtained for the case of a unit disturbance, the\neffect of varying disturbances may be found therefrom\nby Carson\xe2\x80\x99s Theorem. A graphical solution of Carson\xe2\x80\x99s\nIntegral for irregular disturbances is given.\nThe procedure of ohtaining unit solutions of the\nequations is then taken up and the analogy between\nHeaviside\xe2\x80\x99s symbolic series solution and a physical procedure of approximation is shown. It is suggested\nthat a fictitious impulsive disturbance be used in the\ntreatment of initial motions. Bromwich\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation\nof the operational method is briefly described and the\nexpression of the irregular disturbance functions by\ndefinite integrals is shown.\n\nT\n\nDEFINITIONS\nU,,-Equilibrium flight velocity.\nw-Linear velocity in plane of symmetry of airplane and normal to UO.\np-Rolling angular velocity of airplane. (About\nUo as axis).\n\nq-Pitching angular velocity of airplane. (About\naxis normaJ to Uo and to the plane of symmetry).\nL-Rolling nioinent per unit moment of inertia of\nairplane.\n2-Force per unit mass of airplane. (Along w ) .\n\nLp, Z,,\n\n.\n\ndL\n. etc., = -, dZ etc.\n-,\ndw dw\n\nThe use of some mathematical discipline in the study\nof disturbed motions of airplanes seems essential if a\nconsistent advance in the improvement of airplane\nflying and handling qualities is to be made. The study\nof stability alone has thus\xe2\x80\x99far not been of very great\nusefulness in this respect partly because it has been\ndifficult to establish the interpretation of the niathematical definition of stability in terms of control and\nflying qualities.\nA study of the specific effects of disturbances and\ncontrol manipulations is in many respects more instructive than the study of stability alone. A calculation ol\nthe motion of the airplane gives a comprehensible\nresult ; in terms of velocities, accelerations, etc., while\nthe stability calculation must be considered incomplete\nas it yields only an indication of the character of the\nfree motion. Thus if appears that the study of airplane\ndynaniics may be more profitable if the question of\nstability is subordinated to specific questions involving\nthe effects of gusts and control manipulations.\nIt has been considered that the representation of the\nmotions of an airplane under the influence of irregular\ndisturbances would require a prohibitive labor of cal-\n\n23\n\nKUiSLKl\n\nculation. Such differential equations as occur in airplane dynamics are, however, of the same form as those\nused in certain problems of electricity and in other\nbranches and many of the advances made there can be\nadapted to aeronautical problems. It will be seen that\nthese advances result in very practical simplifications\nof the mathematical procedure.\nThe question of the solution of differential equatiolls\narises in the study of airplane dynamics because it is\neasier to write expressions for the detailed component\naccelerations of an airplane in motion than it is to write\nexpressions giving the movements directly. The analysis of the problem, the expression of equations for the\ncomponent accelerations, consists simply in attributing\na component of reaction in each degree of freedom of\ntlie airplane to each component of motion or displacement. The analysis need not be restricted to the airplane as a rigid body, for component deformations of\nthe machine may often be treated as additional degrees\nof freedom.\nAccording to Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s theory of airplane stability the\ncomponent reactions are considered to be directly proportional to the displacements or motions. Originally\nthis assumption was used in application to vanishingly\nsmall motions since the consideration of such motions\nwas sufficient to etablish the stability of steady flight.\nThe latter advance of aerodynamics has shown that the\nsimple linear laws of variation of aerodynamic reactions with the motions should give good approximation\nfor movements of the airplane such as are encountered\nin ordinary maneuvering. Hence the theory was\nextended to the caluculation of unsteady motions of aircraft in general.\nThe assumption of linear laws of aerodynamic reaction (together with other commonly used simplifying\nassumptions) leads to the representation of the accelerations of a disturbed airplane by linear differential equations. It is usually necessary to consider several com.\nponent motions simultaneously, since a movement of the\nairplane in one degree of freedom generally reacts on\nand modifies the movements in other degrees. Thus one\nis led to a set of simultaneous equations. The parameters of these equations, expressing the proportions\nbetween motions and air forces or moments, are termed\n\xe2\x80\x9cstability derivatives.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe set of equations containing only the reactions\nthat the airplane naturally receives when displaced from\nequilibrium flight are the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccomplementary\nequations\xe2\x80\x9d and are those used in the study of stability.\nThis set of equations has a whole family of possible\nsolutions. The possible solutions of a set of complementary equations do have one unique characteristic\nhowever, and that is the indication as to whether or not\nthe natural free oscillations of the airplane tend to\ndiminish with time.\nIf it is desired to calculate the motion of an airplane\ndue to some disturbing influence, such as a gust or a\n\n24\n\nI,\n\nJUNJL>\n\nFIG.1. The superposition of disturbed motions.\n\nmanipulation of the control, it is necessary to include\nterms in the equations that express the component\naccelerations attributed to the disturbance. Thus in\nthe case of a deflected control the known moment\nexerted (per unit moment of inertia of the airplane) is\nadded to the other terms in the appropriate equation.\nSuch disturbing reactions must be given in terms of the\ntime before the equations can be solved. The equation\nexpressing the acceleration in free pitching motion is :\n\n&- wM,\ndt\n\n- qMa = 0\n\nIf, however, a distu:bing pitching moment due to the\nelevator, say, is acting, the equation is written :\n\nwM, - qMa = M(1)\nand it is implied that the right hand side is a function\nof 1.\n\nAlthough the component motions of the airplane\nmutually interfere and must be calculated simultaneously\n(that is, by simultaneous differential equations), the\neffects of component disturbances may be calculated\nseparately and later added in any desired proportion.\nThus if a given impressed rolling moment, acting alone,\ncauses a 20\xe2\x80\x9d bank of the airplane in one second and n\ngiven yawing moment, also acting alone, produces 5\xe2\x80\x9d of\nbank in the same time the combined effect of bath acting\nsimultaneously will be a 25\xe2\x80\x9d bank.\nA somewhat similar statement may be made with\nregard to the effects of disturbances that are not applied\nsimultaneously, viz. ; that if a given disturbance which\narises at the time t = 0 is later augmented in some\namount the effect of the increment of disturbance will\n\nCALCULATION OF T H E MOTION\n\nOF AN\n\nAEROPLANE\n\nFIG. Simple types of disturbances.\n2.\n\nrun its course independently of the effect of the original\ndisturbance. Thus in a problem involving the correction of a gust disturbance by a manipulation of the control a history of the motion due to the uncorrected gust\nnlay be calculated and an entirely independent motion,\ndue to the assumed corrective control manipulation,\nadded later at any desired point. Fig. 1 illustrates\nthis principle.\nThese important characteristics of the dynamical system regarding the superposition of effects of disturbances lead to the consideration of the effect of a simple\n\xe2\x80\x9cunit disturbance.\xe2\x80\x9d The concept of a disturbing acceleration of unit magnitude applied instantly at the time\nt = O to a dynamical system otherwise at rest is\nattributed to Heaviside, who employed it in the development of his Operational Calculus. Carson* utilized this\nconcept to calculate the effect of a varying disturbance\nof arbitrary form.\nThe unit disturbance, otherwise known as the \xe2\x80\x9cunit\nfunction,\xe2\x80\x9d is defined by :\nl ( t ) = 0 when t < 0\n(1)\nl(t) = 1 when t > 0\n(see Fig. 2).\nIn Elettricity this symbol is used to denote a unit\ne.ii1.f. instantly applied at t = 0. The corresponding\nuse in Aeronautics would be to denote a unit impulsive\nlinear or angular acceleration.\nAs an example of the apcplicatjon of this concept suppose that it is required to find the combined pitching\nmotion (4) and the vertical translation (w)of an airplane due to the sharp edged vertical gust of (constant) velocity m.

Obviously the motion will start with the angular acceleration 1 and, as a definite rate of rolling is acquired, will\nbe decelerated in an amount proportional to the rate at\neach instant.

The\nquantities that arise in the consideration of the lateral\nmotions are defined in the follou-ing table:\nVelocities and displacements of airplane axes:\nU,, equilibrium flight velocity along X axis.\nr, component of flight velocity along Y axis\n(sideslipping).\np , component of angular velocity about X axis\n(rolling).\nr, component of angular velocity about 7; axis\n(yawing).\n\xe2\x80\x98 , angle of bank (relative to gravity).\np\nForces and moments resolved along airplane axes:\nY,\ncomponent of force along Y axis.\nL, component of moment about X axis (rolling\nmoment).\nN , component o f moment about Z axis (yawing\nmoment).\nAccelerations of airplane:\nYo=Y/m (force per unit mass).\nL,,=L/mkxZ (moment per unit moment of inertia)\nNo=N/mkz2 (moment per unit moment of inertia)\nGust yelocities resolved along airplane axes:\nI+,, component of gust velocity directed along P\naxis.\nro, component of angular velocity of gust about 7\naxis.\nyo, component of angular velocity of gust about X\naxis.\n\nI\n1\n\n34\n\nNoTE.-The\nsigns of the gust velocities are so\n:hosen that a positive gust produces the same aerolynamic reaction on the airplane as a positive velocity\n,E the airplane in still air.

In the general case\nthe disturbance terms in the equations of motion cannot\nbe thus represented as remaining constant although in\npractical problems they may almost invariably be\nrepresented by means of functions of the form Yoent.\nThe interpretation of Heaviside\xe2\x80\x99s theorem equation (6)\nwhen this form of function is used is (see reference 2):\n\nL\n\nm e n dealing with variable disturbance terms, it is\nimportant to note that a discontinuity of the function\nrepresenting the disturbance a t t = O is implied as in\nequation (6).\nBy the substitution of (in) for n in equation (7),\nexpressions that can be used when the disturbances\n\nThese latter forms are particularly useful because\ntlmost any arbitrary variation of gust or control may\n>y expressed a\xe2\x80\x98s a sum of sine or cosine terms.

I n cases of\nl i l a n e motions this equation is normally of the fourth\nlegree in D ; hence it is not practicable to find the roots\nGrectly. Although a number of methods for approxinating the roots of such equations have been devised,\n,he most direct way is to draw a curve of the function\nF(D) against D, locating the real roots as the points\n:rossing the D axis. Usually in equations of this\n;ype qear roots may be isolated by separating the\n:quation into two parts. Thus, if\n\nli\n\nF(D)=D4+aD3+bD2+cD+d=0\nthere will usually be a large real root near\n1\n\nir D=-a,\n\n(1 1)\n\nIT= -aD3,\n\nand a small one near D=--.\n\nd\nC\n\nThis\n\nlivision follows from the consideration that large roots\ntre more dependent on the coefficients of the higher\npowers of D and small roots, on the lower powers.\nIf the natural motion of the airplane contains oscillatory components, as it usually does, there will be pairs\n3f conjugate complex roots of the polynomial F(D)=O\nin addition to the real roots.

Such a turn is called a "2-control turn," inasmuch as only two (ailerons and elevator)\nof the three available controls are used.

WEICX and ROBERT JONES\nT.\n\n-\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAn analytical study o the lateral controllability o an\nf\nf\nairplane has been made in which both the static rolling\nand yawing moments supplied by the controls and the rea+\nf\ntions due to the inherent stability o the airplane have\nbeen taken into account. The investigation was undertaken partly for the purpose o coordinating the results o\nf\nf\na long series o wind-tunnel investigatwns with phenomf\nena obselved injlight tests; for this reason a hypothetical\naverage airplane, embodging the essential characteristics\no both the wind-tunnel models and the full-size test airf\nplanes, was assumed for the study.\nStability derivatives f o r the average airplane and for\nseveral of the actual jlight-test airplanes were computed,\nand computations were made in a n attempt to reproduce\nby the theory the conditions o several actual jlight tests.\nf\nComputations made o forced rolling and yawing motions\nf\no an F-22 airplane caused by a sudden dejlection o the\nf\nf\nailerons were found to agree well with actual measuref\nments o these motions.\nThe conditions following instantaneous full deJlections\nof the lateral control have been studied, and some attention\nhas been devoted to the controlling o complete turn maneuf\nf\nf\nvers. A portwn o the work was devoted to a study o controllability at stalling angles, and the results o this applif\ncation o theory werefound to agree qualitatively withjlightf\ntesting experience.\nf\nThe angle o bank produced in 1 second, p,, by a dejkction o the rolling control m a y be taken as a relative measf\nf\nf\nure o the control effectiveness. In the analysis o controllability below the stall, it was found that a simple\nmeasure o the rolling effectiveness o a control is given by\nf\nf\nf\nthe sum o a constant times the rolling moment and a con-\n\nstant times the yawing moment. !l\'hus a relative weight or\nimportance is given to the secondary yawing moment produced by the rolling control. I t was concluded that the\nimportance o such secondary moments can be minimized\nf\nby alteration o the moments o inertia o the airplane.\nf\nf\nf\nIncreasing the yawing moment o inertia reduces the\nf\nf\neffectiveness o a given yawing control in producing either\nyawing or rolling motion. Changes s\'f rolling moment\no inertia have little direct effect on either the rolling or\nf\nyawing motion produced by a given rolling control moment.\nThe study o Conditions above the s t d indicated that\nf\nsatisfactory control could not be expected without some\nprovision to maintain the damping in rolling and that a\ndangerous type o instability would arise i the damping\nf\nf\nwere insuficient. The quantity L, N,-L, N,<O was\nfound to give a good measure o this type o instability.\nf\nf\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFor some time the N. A. C. A. has been conducting\na program of research on lateral control for the specific\npurpose of obtaining information that would lead to\nimprovement of control at the low speeds and high\nangles of attack above, the stall, a region in which\npresent conventional ailerons are known to be unsatisfactory. Several series of wind-tunnel investigations\nhave been completed and an attempt has been made to\ncompare a number of widely different lateral-control\ndevices on the basis of what has been considered their\nprimary function-the provision of rolling moment.\nSome of the secondary characteristics, such as the\nyawing moments given by the controls and their effect\non the damping in rolling, were considered but only\nby comparing the various values separately. Flight\n\n47\n\nREPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\ntests were then made with the devices that seemed to\npromise the best lateral control at the stall. Some of\nthem did not perform as had been expected from the\nwind-tunnel tests (see reference I, indicating that the\n)\nfirst approximation, based largely on the rolling\nmoments given by the devices, was an insufficient basis\nfor comparison and that the complete interaction of\nthe secondary factors must very likely be considered.\nReferences 2 to 5 describe important work that has\nbeen done on the lateral control of airplanes in both\nnormal and stalled flight. Reference 2 gives a general\naccount of the problem of control of the stalled airplane; references 3 and 4 describe investigations of the\nlateral control and stability of Merent biplane types.\nThe present report contains the results of a study of\ncontrol effectiveness made by means of computations\nthat take into account the secondary factors includmg\nthe yawing moments given by the controls, their effect\non the damping in rolling, the other lateral-stability\nderivatives, and the moments of inertia of the airplane.\nTwo methods of computation are used. In the first,\nthe rolling and yawing motions are computed step by\nstep for the conditions following a sudden deflection of\nthe lateral control; in the second method a complete\nturn is arbitrarily specified and the co-ntrol moments\nand deflections necessary to perform the maneuver are\nfound. The first method is used to compare the\neffectiveness below the stall of various lateral-control\ndevices and to investigate primarily the effects of\nchanged stability characteristics above the stall.\nThe results of calculations made for normal unstalled\nconditions are compared with measurements made in\nflight using different types of lateral-control devices.\nThe effects of certain changes in the lateral-stability\ncharacteristics below the stall are also studied. The\nmethod used in the study of complete turn maneuvers\nhas proved to be a very practical way of dealing with\nspecific control problems. Here all the stability\ncharacteristics of the airpIane are taken into account\nbut the lengthy and tedious integration of the equations\nof motion is avoided by predetermining the actual\nmovements of the airplane in the form of some desired\nmaneuver and then finding the manipulation of the\ncontrols that would be necessary to execute the specified maneuver. The coordination of the rudder with\nn\ndifferent types of ailerons has been studied i this way.\nMOTION FOLLOWING SUDDEN CONTROL APPLICATION\n\nThe method used for calculating the motion following\na sudden application of the controls consists of a step-\n\nby-step integration. In most cases the control moments were assumed to be applied constantly throughout the motion.\n\n48\n\nAssumptions and symbols.-The assumptions usually made in the study of airplane stability were used\nhere, including:\n1. That the a r forces and moments arising from disi\nplacements of the airplane, relative to its steady condition of flight, are proportional to the displacements or\nto their rates.\n2. That the components of moment due to the different components of motion are additive (i. e., the rolling\nmoment due to the combined rolling and sideslipping\nmay be computed as though the rolling and sideslipping\nhad occurred separately).\nThe axes used in specifying the moments, angular\nvelocities, etc., are fixed in the airplane and therefore\nmove relatively to the a r and to the earth. The X\ni\naxis passes through the center of gravity of the airplane\nin the plane of symmetry and is chosen to point directly\ninto the line of the relative wind when the airplane is\nflying steadily. In other respects the axes form a conventional trihedral system, intersecting at the center of\ngravity of the airplane, the Z axis pointing downward\nin the plane of symmetry and the\'Y axis pointing along\nthe direction of the right wing. The motions discussed\nare those of the moving axes relative to the undisturbed air with the exception of the angle of bank,\nwhich is measured relative to the horizontal.\nThe symbols used in the various formulas are d e k e d\nas follows:\n\nU,, velocity along X axis -in steady\nflight.\nw, velocity of sideslip.\np , angular velocity in rolling.\nr, angular velocity in yawing.\nq, angle of bank.\n2)\n\n@=-\n\nangle of sideslip.\n\nJ\n\nu\n0\n\n#\n\n6, angle of control setting.\n\np component of force along Y axis.\n,\nL, rolling moment (about X axis).\nN, yawing_moment (about 2 axis).\naL\n\n_\n.\n\nmkx\n\n,rolling acceleration due to rolling.\n\nbN\n-\n\nA$=%\n,yawing acceleration due to rolling.\nmkz\netc.\nCgSb where C, is the control rollingGLa=-----p\nmkx\nmoment coefEcient.\nc,,qSb where C,, is the control yawing"=(\n6=\nmoment coacient.\n\n{\n\nEFFECT OF LATERAL CONTROLS IN PRODUCING MOTION OF AN AIRPLANE\n\nb, wing span.\ne, wing chord.\n\nS,wing area.\n\nI, tail length (distance from c. g. to\nt d post).\nmkxz, moment of inertia of airplane about\naxis.\nmkz2, moment of inertia of airplane about\nZ axis.\nr, dihedral angle.\nA, sweepback angle.\nEquations of motion.-The moments acting on the\nairplane during its maneuvers are considered to be\ndivided into two main groups: (1) Those due to the\ndeflected controls, and (2) those arising from the motions of the airplane. The motions are usually supposed\nto be started by the action of the controls alone but, a t\neach succeeding instant, to be conditioned by factors\nthat vary directly in magnitude with the motions or\ndisplacements relative to the air. The effects of the\nmotions are described by quantities known as \xe2\x80\x9cresistnnce,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstability,\xe2\x80\x9d derivatives.

The most important term here is Ys;\nrough estimate shows that its greatest probable effect\nwould be negligible for the type of maneuver\ninvestigated.\nSince the axes changes their orientat.ion in the airplane with different lift coefficients, they w i l l not be\ndirectly in line with the axes of the principal moments\nof inertia. The corrections are small, however, and\nhave been neglected.\nIntegration of equations.-The equations show that\nin order to calculate the acceleration of the motion at\nany time, the velocities p , T, and the angle of sideslip B\nmust be known. This knowledge is, of course, available only when all accelerations before the time in\nquestion are known; an integration is therefore necessary. This integration may be conveniently performed\nby dividing the time during which the motion occurs\ninto very small steps and by assuming that the velocities\nremain constant over these small intervals. I a\nf\nparticular instant is denoted by the subscript n , the\naccelerations a t this instant may be calculated by tlic\nformulas\n\nIf the preceding time instant is denoted by n-1, the\naccelerations at each succeeding instant may be calculated step by step, using the velocities computed\nfrom the previous instant.

The quantities needed in the computations,\nincluding the resistance derivatives, wese determined\nfrom the known dimensions of the F-22 airplane by\nthe methods given in appendix I.\nWhen computed motions and flight records were\nfist compared, it was found that in many cases the\ninitial accelerations in roll predicted from the rolliig\nmoments obtained in the wind tunnel were larger than\nthose shown by the motions recorded in flight. Thus,\nthe full value of the rolling moment measured on the\n\n4.-Rolling and yawing motion of F-23 airplane with retractable ailerons.\nFlaps up: CL=I.O.\n\nEFFECT OF LATERAL CONTROLS I N\n\nmodels was apparently not realized in flight. Examination showed this lack of agreement to be especially\napparent in the cases of devices that would be expected\nto exert the greatest twisting effect on the wings and,\nsince appreciable twisting of the actual wings had been\nobserved in full-scale wind-tunnel experiments, the\ndiscrepancy was attributed to this effect. Calculation\nshowed that in the most extreme case (that of ordinary\nnarrow-chord ailerons) a linearly distributed angle of\ntwist reaching 1 . 7 O at the wing tip would account for\nthe observed difference and that the rolling-moment\ncoefficient would be reduced from 0.056 to 0.043. In\nthis case the a g h t test was made a t a dynamic pressure\nof 9 pounds per square foot. With this first correction\nas a basis, a general correction formula was used in\nwhich the reduction in rolling moment was given as a\nproportion of the dynamic pressure and the change in\nsection pitching-moment coefficient produced by deflecting the controIs.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the rolling and yawing motions\nof the F-22 equipped with long, narrow ailerons. This\nparticular airplane was also equipped with flaps that retracted into the wing ahead of the ailerons. (See reference 6.) Figure 1 illustrates the effect attributed to\ntwisting of the wings. The higher curve was obtained\nwhen a value of the rolling-moment coefficient based\non a wind-tunnel test of a solid wooden model was used.\nThe yawing angular velocity curves showed remarkably\ngood agreement in these two cases, especially as regards\nthe period of the oscillation of this motion.\nThe comparison of the yawing curves in figures 3\nand 4 is not so favorable as in the former cases. In\nfigure 3 it appears that the yawing-moment coefficient\nas computed from the wind-tunnel data was slightly\ngreater than that recorded. In this case the control\nmoment coefficients used in the computations were\nobtained from full-scale wind-tunnel tests of the actual\nairplane; hence no correction for wing twist was applied. The curves of figure 4 apply to a modified\nF-22 airplane equipped with retractable ailerons. It\nis possible that this control device, which is similar\nto a spoiler, has some effect on the yawing moment due\nto rolling. The disagreement in the yawing curves\nwould seem to indicate that too large a negative value\nwas assumed in the computations.\nThe curves of computed rolling motion show no\nconsistent disagreements with the curves plotted from\nthe flight measurements, the differences being of opposite sign in several cases. It seems probable that these\ncomparisons represent the general accuracy obtainable\neither in the experiments or in the calculations.\nCOMPUTATIONS FOR AVERAGE AIRPLANE IN IJNSTAJAED FLIGHT\n\nThe results of the flight experiments with the F-22\nairplane were not suitable for direct comparisons of the\neffectiveness of the various controls used because the\nairplane was modified considerably during the progress\nof the experiments (see references 1 and 6) so that\n\n2ODUCING MOTION OF A N AIRPLANE\n\ndifferent sets of stability derivatives and moments of\ninertia had t o be used in the computations to represent\nthe different individual tests. In order to secure data\nof more general significance and to make a more systematic investigation of control effectiveness than was\npossible in the flight experiments, it was thought\ndesirable to make a series of computations based on a\nstandard set of airplane characteristics, including\nstandard resistance derivatives and moments of inertia.\nAt the same time it was desired to retain the basic\ndimensions of the F-22 machine so that there would\nbe a t least a partial check with the flight-test work a t\nall times.\nthese\nSpecifications of average airplane.-With\nconsiderations in mind the specificationsof an arbitrary\nstandard airplane were devised. The weight and the\nwing area and span of the F-22 airplane were retained\nbut, since other dimensions were obtained from statistical averages, the machine was called an \xe2\x80\x9caverage\nairplane.\xe2\x80\x9d These statistical averages were obtained\nby studying the specifications of a number of conventional airplanes of different sizes, weights, and types.\nData from 20 to 40 airplanes were used for the determination of average values of the folIowing characteristics:\n1. The ratio of the total fin and rudder area to\nthe wing area.\n2. The ratio of the tail length (i. e., distance\nfrom c. g. of airplane to the tail post) to the\nwing span.\n3. The ratios of the radii of gyration in rolling\nand yawing to the wing span.\n\nThe moments of inertia were obtained from data listed\nin reference 8. That the characteristics thus obtained\ndid not differ appreciably from those of the F-22 is\nshown by the following table:\nRangepf.\nCharae\neharacterr4Ia teristies of\nof F-22 airSverage\nplane used in airplane\nEight tests\n~\n\nWeight. ___...._.________._..----.--.-.......pounds.. 1 . ~ 1 , f f i O\n1,6m\n32\n30- 32.8\nWingspan _.._._____.....______----......\n- . . .feet..\n...171\n161- 1 \xe2\x80\x99\nWingarea_._._......________...........7 2\n. squarefeet..\n.\n1.\n08\n1.\n01\nArea of finand rudder.........___.___.._..-.-.-.do...14.6\n1.\n46\nTail length _...___...._..._____--.........--... .feet-.\nmk\n\n1.216\n6961,554\n....._________..._._.-.---.......-......\n\n1....______\n~\n\nI\n\n1.700\n\nComputations based on a purely dimensionless average airplane were considered, but it was thought that\nthe results would have a more concrete meaning if they\nwere presented in terms of an airplane of particular\nsize, especially since they could then be directrlycompared with the fkght results.\nUnstalled-flight computations.-Most of the lateralcontrol devices tested in the wind tunnel did not cause\nany change in the stability derivatives of the wings\n(spoiler devices are a notable exception).

Thus, a t each of the three\nlift coefficients two computations were made, one to\ndetermine the motion due to a yawing moment and the\nother to determine the motion due to a rolling moment.\nThe following table lists the values of the coefficients\nthat were used:\nCL:0.35; 1.0; and 1.8 (20 percent c split flaps, f d\nspan).\nC,, : 0.01 and 0.\nGI : 0 and 0.04.\nIn these cases the dihedral angle assumed for the average airplane was 1O.

By showing the effect of secondary\ncontrol moments in producing motion of the airplane,\nthey give a measure of the relative $eight to be assigned such secondary moments in comparing different\ndevices. These factors will, of course, be somewhat\ndifferent for airplanes of different stability characteristics and the relative effects of secondary control moments will be expected to be somewhat different also.\nThe average airplane is simply a convenient yardstick\nin this respect.\nI the factors given in figures 7 and 8 are used as\nf\nabsolute measures of the amount of motion produced\nin 1 second (aside from their use simpIy in comparing\nvarious control devices), a greater error will be committed in applying them to airplanes of different size\nthan in applying them to airplanes of somewhat different stability characteristics. Reference 9 gives the\nnecessary rules for correctly applying the present data\nto airplanes of any size or weight in which certain\ndefinite aspects of similarity are preserved. The theory\nrequires that the airplanes be geometrically similar\nalthough they may have different densities. Practically, this requirement necessitates that the outward\nforms of the airplanes be similar and that the ratios\nof the radii of gyration about each axis to the Wing\nspan be the same. The motions of the different sized\nairplanes are compared a t equal values of the lift coefficient. With equal values of the wing loading the\nangular velocities are inversely proportional to the\nspans: Thus,\n\n76740-37-2\n\n53\n\nI"=\n\nREPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMIWEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\ntad as ordinate\n\n2o\nu\n\nand\n\n2Uo\n\npb\n2U\no\n\n)r\n\nSgb\nWith similar airplanes of different wing loadings the\nstate of motion existing a t a given time for one will\ngenerally pertain to a different instant for another,\nwhich is also true of an airplane of the same size and\nloading but flying in air of different density.

Accordingly, a study of the results of both\nseries of tests was made with the object of determining\nwhether the conditions encountered in practice could\nbe reproduced in theory.\nUnfortunately, the wind-tunnel experiments showed\nthat no certain determination of the factors (resistance\nderivatives) involved in the motion of a stalled airplane\nwas possible. On the other hand, the flight experiments\nindicated that these factors apparently had no definite\nvalues (according to their usual definition), inasmuch\n\n55\n\nREPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nas the action of the airplane could not be foretold\nfrom one experiment to the next. For example, the\noutcome of a simple aileron movement might in one\ninstance be a roll in the direction urged by the control;\nwhereas a t another time, under practically the same\nconditions, the foil would be the reverse of that intended.\nStability derivatives above stalling angles.-The\nreasons for the apparently contradictory results of the\nflight tests may be found in the wind-tunnel measure-\n\nof rolling moment due to rolling and sideslip at various\nangles of attack.

Figure 11 shows typical\nmeasurements of coefficients by which these quantities\nare determined. These curves show that the rolling\nmoment due to sideslip of a straight wing increases\nenormously as the stall is approached, reaching values\n7 or 8 times as great as those at medium angles below\nstalling. Under the same conditions the damping\n\n56\n\nmoment in rollkg changes sign and becomes nil\n%ding\xe2\x80\x9d (autorotational) moment.\nObviously many of the assumptions of the method as\nused in investigating unstalled-flight phenomena are\nnot true in the case of stalled flight. I n particular, the\nassumed independence of small longitudinal and lateral\nmotions, which is supported by both experience and\nreason for the ordinary-flight range, cannot be said to\nhold under these new conditions because t5e values of\nthe derivatives change very rapidly with small changes\nof Iongitudinal attitude (angle of attack). The assumption that the components of a moment arising from\ndifferent sources may be added together as though their\ncauses occurred separately is apparently borne out only\nin the abstract sense of representing the average\ncondition.\nIn spite of these limitations of the method, it was\nconsidered feasible to extend the computations to the\ncondition of stalled flight in the sdudy of the general\nconditions encountered in controlling such flight,\nalthough the results of the computations made for\nthese conditions do not have the same significance as\nthose made for conditions below the stall. The former\nresults gave quantitative estimatgs of the amount of\nmotion produced by given control moments; the extension of the computations to stalled flight will only\nillustrate the various phenomena that may result from\nthe conditions predicted by the Wind-tunnel experiments.\nExperience in attempting controlled flight above the\nstall has shown that the possibility of controlling such\nflight depends as much on the natural stability characteristics of the airplane as on the possibility of\nsecuring adequate controlling moments. Because of\nthis fact the present,computations were made primarily\nto investigate the effects of changed stability characteristics (derivatives). Another important reason for\nchoosing various combinations of stability derivatives\nis the fact that no very definite values can be assigned\nto them for a particular lift coefficient, as was possible\nin the unstalled-fight range.\nFor these reasons the investigation of controllability\nabove the stall is necessarily preseated in a manner\ndifferent from that used in the cases of ordinary flight.\nThe wind-tunnel measurements were studied to find the\napproximate variation of the resistance derivatives over\na range of angles of attack definitely above the stall,\nchosen to include the region of most violent instability.\nThe particular lift coefficient assumed was n e c e s s d y\nsomewhat loosely defined (CL=1.2);it was so taken\nto represent extreme stalling as well as intermediate\nconditions. The calculation of the stability derivatives\na t these angles is given in appendix I.\nIn the variation of the stability characteristics to\ntake account of the range of possible condit:ons, the\neffects of the parts of the airplane other than the wings\nwere not considered.

(See appendix I for determination of these\nderivatives.)\nThe computations were made to cover more than a\ndozen different combinations of these values of the\nderivatives in conjunction with a given fixed pair of\ncontrol rolling and yawing moments. These arbitrary\ncontrolling moments were chosen to represent rollingand yawing-moment coefficientssomewhat greater than\nthose obtained with ordinary ailerons but which might\nbe attained in practice with rather large ailerons, especially those of the short, wide type described in reference 7, I. As in the previous computations (below\nstall), the sign of the standard yawing-moment coefficient was alternated, giving the effect of favorable and\nadverse, as well as zero, secondary yawing moment.\nRange of investigation of stalled flight.-Since in\nt.liesc computations the plan was to study the possibility o control rather than to obtain any numerical\nf\nmeasure of control effectiveness, the procedure of the\ncomputations was sometimes varied in such a way as to\nrepresent attempts of the control to check motions of\nthe airplane as well as to start them. In some cases\nthe motion was assumed to be due to some external\ncause and to exist a t the start of the computations,\nwhile in other cases the initial setting of the control\nwas reversed after a short interval in an attempt to\ncheck the motionit had already produced. The effects01\nboth favorable and adverse yaw were tried in these cases\nResults of computations.-Figure 12 shows rolling\nmotions resulting from suddenly applied and continuously maintained aileron deflections giving a rollingmoment coefficient of 0.04 and an adverse yawing-\n\nFIGURE -Rolling motions resulting from application of adverse-yaw aileron L O I I 12\ntrol in stalled flight with different coinbinations of stability derivativcs, C A I 01;\nc.=-0.02\n\noccurred within the predictable range of tlie stability\nderivatives.\nThe effects of smaller control rolling and yawing\nmoments may be visualized simply by reducing the\nscales of the motions. Thus in figure 12 the motions\ncalculated for Cc=0.02 and Cn=-O.Ol would be just\nhalf those plotted.\nFigure 13 shows the results of attempts to check an\ninitial disturbance in rolling with both favorable- and\nadverse-yaw ailerons. The failure of the adverse-yaw\nailerons is due mainly to the yawed attitude they produce, although the actual yawing motion accounts for\nan appreciable effect. Figure 14 differs from figure 13\nin that it includes also conditions-in which the initial\n\n57\n\nREPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nmotion countered by the ailerons was assumed to be\ndue to the action of the control rather than to an external disturbance in rolling. Here the ailerons were\ncalled upon to check whatever yawing motion they had\npreviously produced. In this case it w i l l be noted that\nthe favorable-yaw ailerons encountered difJiculty because it was hard to recover from the initial motion\nthey had produced.\nFigure 15 shows the effect of a delay in attempting to\nrecover from rolling and yawing motion. Because of\nthe instability of the airplane, the motion could not be\nchecked even though the yawing moment of the ailerons\nW W favorable. Thus, for the particular case illustrated,\nn delay of 0.1 second in reversing the control changed\nthe action from one in which the airplane followed the\n\n;tall is the loss of the damping in rolling.

The first two effects, which aid the angular\nmotion indirectly, relate to L, and N,, proportional,\nrespectively, to the rolling moment due to yawing and\nthe yawing moment due to rolling.

I n addition to the damping in rolling, the wing moment\ncharacteristics that show marked change a t the stalling\npoint and contribute to the instability are L,, Lo, and\nN,. The factor L,, proportional to the rolling moment\ndue to yawing, depends on the lift coefficient and on\nthe spanwise distribution of lift. Obviously, the\ngreater the lever arm of the supporting lift, the greater\nL, will be and, since it is desired to make L, smaller,\ntapering the wings or shortening their span should\nhelp. The factor Lo at normal angles of attack depends\nalso on this spanwise lever arm of the lift and on the\ndihedral angle. At stalling angles different tip shapes\nhave considerable effect and the relation between the\ndihedrd angle and the rolling moment reverses, the\ngreatest moment being shown by the straight wing\nwith square or upturned tips. (See fig. 11.) Here\nalso, shortening the span and tapering the wing should\nimprove conditions. The use of ,a moderate dihedral\nangle appears desirable in the stalled condition. Tlic\nother Wing characteristic, N,, would be favorably\naffected by shortening the span of the wings. Here\nits magnitude depends mainly on the rate of increase\nof the profile drag of the wings and on the effective\narm of the increase. If no damping in rolling (L,)\nis present, there will be no induced N , but in this case\nthe slope of the wing profile-drag curve is almost certain to be very great, more than accounting for the\ninduced effect. (See appendix I.) Taper or washout\nof the wings should help this situation. The provision\nof damping in rolling calls for keeping the wing tips\nfrom stalling; this requirement is compatible with all\nthe others mentioned except that for small L,. The\ndesirability of maintaining the damping, however, far\noutweighs this consideration.\nIn the ronsidcrn tion of modifications of wing c l ( ~ s i ~ n\nto improve tho contrnllnbilitjy n t high angles, it) ir,\ninipnrtniit to tnlte nrcnunt of tlic premature tip-shlliiig\nl~l~eiioiiinin\ncsliihitctl by tapered wings. As WIIS\npointed nut in tlic previous discussion, reducing Id 14.\nlift and the slopc of the drag curvc near the tips woiilcl\nlead to improved conditions. If this improvement is\neffected simply by tapering the wings, however, thc\nnet result may be detrimental to controllability on\naccount of the premature loss of roll damping dile to\nthe stalling of the tips. In the case of any Wing with\nan extreme reduction of chord, the downwash distributes itself in such a manner as to tend to maintain a\nmore uniform distribution of the actual lift, so that the\nlift coefficient, and hence the effective angle of attack,\nof the reduced-chord sections is greater than at other\nsections. Pressure-distribution tests show that the\ntip portions of a 5 :1 tapered wing reach their maximum\nlift coefficients at angles as much as 5 below the\n\'\nstalling angle of the center portions of the Wing. Thus,\n\nEFFECT OF LATERAL CONTROLG I N PRODUCING MOTION OF AN AIRPLANE\n\ntapering the wings cannot be expected to improve the\ncontrollability a t low speeds unless the taper is accompanied by some washout, or unless other provision\nis made to prevent the tips from stalling.\nIt may be inferred from the foregoing discussions\nthat the effects of high aspect ratio will be detrimental\nto controllability and stability above the stall. It is\neasily seen how the unstable tendencies of the wings\nwould be more unfavorable to controllability if the\nwings were of large span. I the span is large in prof\nportion to the lever arm of the rudder control, the wings\nmay easily develop yawing tendencies that will coinpletely overpower the rudder moments. Furthermore,\nsince rapid yawing motion induces a rolling moment\nthrough L,, it is important to provide a large damping\nin yawing as an indirect check on the rolling as well as\non the yawing motions. Thus it appears that considerable tail length and fn area are desirable to increase\ni\nboth N, and NB. Inasmuch as there ordinarily exists\na great disproportion between the dampings in rolling\nand yawing below the stall, it is probable that fairly\nlarge increases in h , would be permissible without\nT\ncausing undesirable stiffness of the rudder control a t\nhigh speeds. Increasing NB by using larger vertical\ntail surfaces is especially desirable because in that way\nthe available rudder control is increased. Data on\nconventional airplanes show that the rudders used\nproduce the weakest of the three controlling moments;\ntheir maximum moment is often smaller than the secondary yawing moment of the ailerons, yet the rudder\ndeals with the largest moment of inertia of the airplane\nand should be the most effective control in checking\nthe unstable yawing tendencies of the wings (as, for\ninstance, in spinning). It appears that considerable\nimprovement in these characteristics could be effected\nby enlarging the fin surface of conventional machines.\nIf the increased rudder control is found to be undesirnble at high speed because of too great sensitiveness, a\ncorrespondq increase in N,, the damping in yawing,\nshould remedy this trouble and still further improve\nt . 1 1 ~Controllability a t high angles. Thus if the tail is\ninadc longer as the vertical surface is increased, the\ncontrol characteristics at high speed should not be\niiniavorably affected. i t appears unlikely, however,\nthat such improvements could result in the retention of\nsatisfactory control above the stall if the autorotational\ntendencies shown by ordinary wings in wind-tunnel\nexperiments are developed.\nTURN MANEUVERS\n\nThe foregokg computations were designed to represent the procedure employed in a particular type of\nfight test to compare the efficiency of various control\ndevices purely on the basis of their independent action\nin producing roll. Another type of flight test, qualitative in nature, consisted of performing normal turn\n\nmaneuvers with the airplane, using the device in conjunction with the other controls and observing the\namount of coordination that was required.\nThe first type of computation together with the fight\ntests showed that the roll-producing effectiveness of\nsome devices would be influenced by the occurrence of\nconsiderable incidental sideslipping, much of the apparent improvement due to favorable secondary yaw\nbeing obtained by the production of outward sideslipping.\nSince it was not known in any quantitative way how\nthe presence of this sideslipping tendency due to the\nsecondary aileron moments would affect the controllability in making actual turn maneuvers, it was decided\nto make an analysis of these conditions, representing\nanalytically as nearly as possible the second stage of the\nfight tests.\nEXPLANATION OF METHOD OF COMPUTATIONS\n\nIn certain instances in the former computations a\nsimple sort of controlled maneuver was used in which\nan initial deflection of the ailerons was reversed, representing an attempt to check a motion previously\nproduced by them. (See fig. 13.) It was realized that\nan extension of this procedure could be applied to the\npresent problem by means of step-by-step integrations\nof the motion due to any arbitrarily specified way of\napplying the controls. This adaptation of the former\nmethod would have required a knowledge of the control\nmanipulations necessary to perform a normal turn, as\nwell as lengthy step-by-step calculations. For these\nreasons it was considered more feasible to predetermine\nthe actual motion of the airplane than to fix on an\narbitrary way of applying the controls. Furthermore\nit seemed reasonable to presume that the pilot of an\nairplane would conform his use of the controls to suit\na desired maneuver, rather than to prescribe beforehand his use of the control and accept whatever motion\nof the airplane followed.# He would then judge tho\neffectiveness of the control by the way it had to be uscd\nto obtain a desired result.\nAs the outcome of these considerations, tho pro1)hii\nof investigating turn maneuvers presented itself in II\nway inverse to the previous problems. Here the motioi~\nof the airplane was given and the requisite use of thc\ncontrols was sought. Previously the airplane motions\nhad been determined from the controlling accelerations\nby integration, whereas here the accelerations incident\nto a given motion were to be determined; thus the\nprocess would simply be a differentiation.\nPeriodic or trigonometric functions of the time\nnaturally suggested themselves for the representation\nof the angular velocities and displacements during a\nturn maneuver. By the use of trigonometric functions\nof the time, any conceivable maneuver of the airplane\nthat begins and ends in level flight may be specified;\nthat is, any given manner of varying the attitude or\n\n61\n\nREPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nangular velocity of the airplane during a given kterval\nmay be described by a formula such as\np , or p, or . . . etc.\n=A, sin nt+A, sin 2nt+AP sin 3nt+etc.\n(16)\n\nBy a suitable choice of n the maneuver may be made to\nextend over as long or as short a time as desired.\nIn the present case it was intended that the airplane\nroll up to a moderate angle of bank, starting with the\nwings level, and check its rate of rolling so as to maintain this bank angle steadily, then roll back to the\nlevel condition after a definite time interval. Throughout this interval the airplane was to be yawing appropriately while banking and in the correct amount to\nprevent sideslipping during every part of the maneuver. Thus the turn was to be \xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d in that no\nsideslip was permitted and the coordination of the\nlateral controls (ailerons and rudder) necessary to\naccomplish such a maneuver was to be studied.\nA few trials in plotting cosine curves against time\nshowed that the expression\np=-Al\n\ncos nt-% Al cos 2nt+constant\n\n(17)\n\nwould represent a bank that assumed a steady angle at\nthe midpoint of the maneuver, starting with zero at\nthe time t = O and becoining zero again at t=T/n.\nArranging for the bank to become steady at the midpoint of the maneuver and choasing nt so as not to\ncoincide with the natural period of the free motions of\nthe airplane obviated the possibility of any reinforced\noscillation phenomena during the maneuver. The\nform of the curve of bank angle against time plotted to\nthis formula is shown in figure 17.\nIn order to attain the specified bank a t every instant,\na definite rate of rolling is required at all times, which\nis obviously found by differentiat.ingthe bank equation;\nthus\nd\n2n\np = z = n A 1 sin n t + T A , sin 2nt\n(18)\nIn order for the airplane to turn without sideslipping,\nthere must be a coordination between the banlring and\nyawing at all times. The outward and inward accelerations must cancel, that is:\n\nrUO=g sin p\n\n(19)\n\n(See equation (12).)\nThis equation enables the calculation of r from\nassuming the condition that\n\np\n\nis satisfied. The curve of yawing angular velocity\nplotted against time is thus very similar in shape to thc:\nbad<-angle curve, reaching n steady value a t its mid-\n\npoint.\n\n62\n\nThe specification of the angular velocities and angles\nthe airplane in the foregoing manner is analogous to\nthe specification of constraints of the motion. The\ntotal accelerations necessary to constrain the airplane\nto the specified motions are calculated by differentiating\nthe expressions for the angular velocities, p and r.\n(See equat.ions (17) and (18).)\n3f\n\ndP-d%- 8 A ,\nz-z2-n\n\n4n2\ncos nt+-Al\n4\n\ncos 2nt\n\n(21)\n\nmd\n\nThese accelerations are not furnished altogether by\nthe controls but have components due to the air reactions on the moving airplane. The air reactions are\ncalculated from the resistance derivatives and,when\ndeducted from the total accelerations, give the components necessarily supplied by the deflected controls.\nThus the acceleration supplied by the rolling control\nwill be\n&=-& --pL,-rL,\ndP\n(23)\nIf the application of rolling control is accompanied by a\nsecondary (adverse or favorable) yawing moment, the\nrudder control will have to accommodate this moment\nas well as the residual acceleration of the yawing\nmotion. This secondary yawmg moment may be\nconsidered to be a function of the rolling moment and\n;\nits acceleration written as f @La) then\n\nsN6=z-pNp-rNr-f\ndr\n\n@La)\n\nEquation (24) gives the amount of rudder coordination\nnecessary with a given aileron-control device. The\nrolling- and yawing-moment coefficients corresponding\nto these acceleratibns may be calculated by known\nmeans from the speed of fight and the airplane dimensions.\nIn the derivation of the equations for the turn\nmaneuvers no account was takeo of the pitching motion\ninvolved. Obviously if a banked airplane is turning\nwithout loss of altitude there will be a component of\nn\npitching involved in the motion. As was errpltkned i\nthe description of the step-by-step method of computation the pitching motion may be considered separately\nand independently of the lateral motions since the airplane is symmetrical about the plane in which pitching\noccurs. Presumably, the only ways in which pitching\nmotions can influence the lateral motions are by a\nchange of speed or attitude introducing changes i the\nn\nlateral-stnbility derivatives or by gyroscopic couples.\nIn the case of a prescribed turn maneuver the maximum\ngyroscopic couple may be estimated in advance and the\nrelative importance of its effect may be foreseen. The\nother secondary influence may bc partly accounted for\n\nEFFECT OF LATERAL CONTROLS IN PRODUCING MOTION OF AN AIRPLANE\n\nby assuming a certain increased speed throughout the\nturn. Either the air speed or the attitude will, in\ngeneral, vary continuously throughout the turn if no\naltitude is lost or gained. For turns up to 30" angle\nof bank the change in stability derivatives thus produced will be sliiht and may be satisfactorily campen-\n\n-4\n.\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nrhere Poi the dynamic pressure a t steady-flight speed\ns\ns\n,nd p is the angle of bank a t which the airplane i\nssumed to lose or gain no altitude.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe foregoing procedure was applied to the c s e of\nhe average airplane performing 30\xc2\xb0 banked turns a t\nT ~ ~ O speeds.

As in the previous computations,\nlift coefficients of 0.35, 1.0, and 1.8 were assumed,\nalthough the corresponding speeds were increased s o m e\nwhat over those in the previous computations to\naccount for the additional lift while turning, as previously explained. With the assumption of no loss of\naltitude at 30\xc2\xb0 bank, the speeds were increased by the\nfactor\nI .\n\n4k6=\n\n1.074\n\n63\n\nREPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nThe values of L,, L,, N,, N,, corresponding to the\ngiven Lift coefficients, were also multiplied by this\nfactor. (See appendix I.)\nThe curves of rolling motion and angle of bank calculated for these maneuvers are those shown in figure 17.\nThe formula for the bank angle was\n(cos t+ 1/4 cos 2t) +0.327\n(26)\nreaching 5 maximum of 30\xe2\x80\x99 a t T seconds. This formula\ndetermined the angular velocities and accelerations by\nthe principles already demonstrated.

These computations showed that the\nnaximum yawing moment necessary at the lowest\nspeed was 10 times as great as that a t high speed, while\n,he maximum rolling-moment coefficient increased only\nL times under the same circumstances. Figure 19\nllustrates this increase of coefficient necessary to per\xe2\x80\x98 o m the specified maneuver in the same time at the\nower speeds.\nFigure 20 shows the effects of favorable and adverse\n;econdary aileron yawing moments on the rudder con,rol necessary throughout the turn. Positive yawing\nnoments indicate a setting of the rudder in a direction\n,o aid the turning. It will be noted that the existence\nIf any secondary aileron moment calls for a counteractng movement of the rudder applied simultaneously\nMith the ailerons a t the beginning of the turn. With\nio secondary aileron moments the curves show that the\n;imultaneous initial deflection of both ailerons and\n.udder is not required, the turn being initiated by the\ntilerons alone with the rudder being. applied after the\n;tart. In the case of favorable secondary yawing monents an initial setting of the rudder opposite to the\niirection of the turn is required, while on beginning\nh e recovery the rudder has to be moved slightly in a\nlirection that would normally tend to continue the\nturning. It appears that ailerons giving no secondary\nyawing moments of either sign would .require the least\nrudder coordination in making turns without sidedipping.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. The agreement of the computations with Idic\n\nmaneuver may be presumed to be of any time extent by\nassuming a continuation of this steady point, which\noccurs a t T seconds.\nThe results of a series of these computations showed\nprincipally the effect of flight speed on the degree of\ncontrol deflection necessary to perform a given maneuver and the effect of favorable-yaw and of adverse-yaw\nailerons on the amount of rudder control required.\nFigure 18 shows the rolling- and yawing-moment coefficients necessary to accomplish the maneuver a t speeds\ncorresponding to the three different lift coefficients.\nFor the average airplane these were:\n\n64\n\nresults of flight tests verifies the usefulness of thc\nmethod utilizing stability derivatives for the study of\ncontrollability both above and below the stall.\n2. The angle of bank produced in 1 second, PI, by n\nfull deflection of the lateral control may be taken ns a\nrelative measure of the control effectiveness. In the\ncase of a conventional airplane this measure is given\nby a simple formula involving the static rolling and\nyawing moments produced by the control, namely:\nrpl\n\n=constantX Cz+constantX C,,\n\n3. The effect of secondary adverse yawing moments\non the aileron control may be moderated by increasing\n\nthe moment of inertia about the yaw axis, although\nit is to be expected that the power of the rudder will be\ncorrtxpondingly reduced. Increasing the moment of\ninertia about the roll axis should have little direct\n\nEFFECT OF LATERAL CONTROLS IN PRODUCING MOTION OF AN AIRPLANE\n\ninfluence on the lateral-control effectiveness with a\ngiven rolling-control moment.\n4. The tendency for a given adverse yawing moment\nto render the laterd control ineffective becomes greater\nwith increasing dihedral. In no case should the ratio\nof the control adverse yawing moment to the rolling\nmoment be dowed to exceed (in absolute magnitude)\neither:\n(a) The ratio of yawing to rolling moment acting on\nthe airplane in sideslip; or\n(b) The ratio of yawing to rolling moment acting on\nthe airplane in yawing.\n5. It appears that ailerons giving nearly zero yawing\nmoment would require the least coordination of the\nrudder control in executing turn maneuvers without\nsideslip.\n6. The study of conditions above the stall indicates\nthat satisfactory control cannot be expected unless\n\nTABLE 1.-STEP-BY-STEP\n\n1.68\n\n0\n.05\n\n.lo\n\n.20\n.30\n.40\n.50\n.60\n\n.70\n.80\n.90\n\n1.00\n\n1.680\n1.409\n1.181\n\n-.7m\n\n.518\n\n.329\n.199\n.lo9\n.5\n00\n.M)9\n\n-.013\n-*027\n\n0\n\n.OM\n.154\n\n--In4\n\nXAi\n\nXAt\n\n+8.-1\n\n+\'p"-l\n\nX-0.663\n\n--I0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n.n\nz\n\n.004\nf019\n.M6\n\n.436\n.456\n.467\n.472\n.473\n.472\n\n.165\n.211\n.257\n.3M\n\n.351\n.4a3\n\nC,=O]\n\n8"\'\n\n-\n\n-___\nsee.\n\nXAt\n+P.-1\n\ntlj\n\nLANGLEY\nMEMORIAL\nAERONAUTICAL\nLABORATORY,\nNATIONAL\nADVISORY\nCOMXITTEE AERONAUTICS,\nFOR\nLANGLEY\nFIELD,\nVA., ,4pril20, 1936.\n\n-\n\n\'pn\nPn-1\n\n6L6+2Li\n\nThis condition appears to be next in importance\ndirect damping in rolling.\n\n[c\'=l.o;\ncl=o.M;\n\nPm\n\n(ah=\n\nL&r>LNp\n\nCOMPUTATION O F MOTION OF AVERAGE AIRPLANE\n\n--\n\nTime\n\nsome provision is made to maintain the damping in\nrolling a t these angles.\n7.

Sweepback of the wings is known to have an\neffect similar to dihedral, although comparatively few\ntests have been made. Unlike the rolling moment due\nto dihedral angle, however, the rolling effect of sweepback appears to be approximately proportional to the\nlift coefficient, disappearing at zero lift as would be\nexpected. Presumably, its effect may be added to the\nothers as in the case of the dihedral.

A study of the results of these tests\nindicated that at low angles of attack the yawing\nmoment may be estimated from the area and disposition of the vertical fin with a suitable allowance for\nthe fuselage effect. Although airplane bodies when\ntested alone almost invariably show an unstable yawing\ntendency about the center of gravity, when tests of a\ncomplete model are made the results may show an\nadditional stabilizing influence of the fuselage, possibly\ndue to interference effects. At high lift coefficients the\nwings may exert considerable influence. The effect of\nthe fuselage depends, of course, on its disposition with\nrespect to the center of gravity and also on the nose\nshape. Models, especially those with uncowled radial\nengines, often show only 40 or 50 percent of the righting\nmoment calculated for the fin and rudder alone.\nThe part of the yawing moment in yaw due to the\nvertical fin surface may be estimated by means of the\ndata previously used for the calculation of N,,\n\nIn cases of airplanes having wings set at a dihedral\nangle some provision must be made for an additional\nyawing moment in yaw that arises as a consequence of\nthe setting of the wings. In straight flight, lift vectors\ndrawn on each wing half, being inclined inward by the\nangle of dihedral, would intersect on the Z axis vertically above the center of gravity. These lift vectors\nremaining at the same time petpendicular to the\nleading-edge lines and to the relative wind direction\ndo not intersect when the wing is yawed, giving rise\nto a couple. A simpIe approximation results in\n1\nCn= ---r BC,\n5\nSince this component of yawing moment is attributed\nto dihedral setting, it may be represented by\n(53)\n\nfor calculation.\nIn addition to the simple dihedral effect, an induced\nyawing moment on the yawed wing must be considered\nas a secondary effect of the rolling moment.

Several hypothetical assumptions of piloting\nprocedure, each of which is considered to represent a\ncomponent of the actual procedure, are studied. Di#erent\nmeans of two-control operation are also discussed and it is\nconcluded that a reliable rolling-moment control that does\nnot give the usual adverse secondary yawing moment\nshould be most satisfactory. Several special modijications\nintended to make the airplane more suitablefor two-control\noperation are also discussed, and it is found that relatively\ngreat weathercock stability (Ne)would be desirable.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA number of flights have been made with airplanes\nutilizing both the aileron-elevator and the elevatorrudder combinations for two-control operation. Some\nquestion exists as to whicli of these modes of operation\nis likely to prove the better and also whether either of\nthem is capable of affording the controllability requisite\nto safety in fLight. Such questions must, of course, be\neventually decided by experience, no mathematical\nanalysis being sufficiently broad to deal with all aspects\nof the problem. It is believed, nevertheless, that certain conceptions gained from an analysis of the problem\nmay be useful in furthering development along these\nlines.\nOne of the purposes of the present work was to\nascertain on theoretical grounds which of the two\npossible modes of operation was more likely to prove\nsatisfactory. It was also desired to find what changes\nmight be effected in a conventional airplane to make it\nmore suitable for two-control operation.\nThe analysis of the various dynamical problems that\narise makes use of many concepts that are discussed\nat length in reference 1. The treatment of airplane\nmotion as a problem of dynamics is based primarily on\n\nthe assumptions of the theory of airplane stability as\ndeveloped by Bryan and others; for the elucidation of\nthis theory the reader is referred to text books on\naeronautics.\nMATHEMATICAL TREATMENT OF CONTROLLED\nMOTION\n\nThe motion of an airplane with adequate control\nabout its three axes may, in one sense, be regarded as a\npurely constrained motion. From this point of view,\nthe act of piloting the airplane must be\'considered to be\nthe use of the available control means for overcoming\nthe inherent aerodynamic and inertial reactions of the\nairplane, causing it to follow a more or less definitely\nconstrained motion induced by the controls. The\nnatural oscillation and damping of the free motion of\nthe airplane do not appear, then, in the controlled\nmotion because the pilot has accommodated his use\nof the available control to the governing of these\ninherent tendencies. Accordingly the stability or instability of the airplane will be apparent only in the requisite use of the controls to perform a given maneuver.\nIt has been found by experience that the lateralstability characteristics of an ordinary airplane are\nsuch that it is feasible to abandon one of the direct\nconstraints of the later81 motion in ordinary flight\nmaneuvers. All lateral maneuvers that are to be\nperformed with a minimum of sideslipping or sidewise\nacceleration require a definite coordination between\nthe banking and yawing motions; it appears that a\nconventional airplane will naturally tend to fulfill this\nrequisite relation in greater or less degree, on account\nof the inherent stability, even when one of the lateral\ncontrols is abandoned.\nUnder the conditions of two-control operation the\nmotion of the airplane cannot be considered as an entireJ.y constrained motion. The pilot of such a machine\ncan exercise direct constraint in only one of the three\ncomponents of lateral movement and must depend on\nthe natural tendencies of the airplane for the requisite\ncoordination of the other motions. In order to show\nthis coordination the airplane need not be entirely\nstable with all controls released, but it is imperative\nthat there be satisfactory stability in those components\nin which the machine is unconstrained. Thus, if an\n\n75\n\nREPORT NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nairplane is to be controlled by the ailerons and elevator\nalone, it must be satisfactorily stable in combined\nyawing and sideslipping, in which it is free; if control\nis by rudder and elevator, corresponding stability in\ncombined banking and sideslipping is necessary.\nI the controls are considered to impress constraints\nf\nin those components of motion in which they operate\ndirectly, the movements of a two-control airplane may\nbe studied by the method of forced oscillations. Thus,\nif the airplane controlled by ailerons is caused to follow\na definite course in banking, in which it is considered\nto be constrained, this motion will impress disturbing\nforces and couples leading indirectly to yawing and\nsideslipping motions. The yawing and sideslipping\nmotions must, however, be considered to be unconstrained and to be conditioned by the natural stability\nof the machine as well as by the impressed disturbances.\nThe disturbing forces or couples impressed in those\ncomponents in which the airplane is unconstrained\nare caused by the constrained movements and are\nconsidered proportional to them. The factors of\nproportionality are simply the appropriate stability\nderivatives of the airplane. Thus, if the machine is\nconstrained to follow a definite sequence of rolling\nmotions by the application of a suitable contxol moment,\na disturbing acceleration in yawing that is proportional to the given rate of rolling at each instant will\nbe impressed, namely:\ndr\nimpressed -=pxN,,\n\nr, yawing component of angular velocity.\nv, component of 3ight velocity along Y\naxis (sideslip).\n(p, angle of bank (relative to gravity).\n8, angle of sideslip vlUo, approximately.\n6, angle of rudder or aileron deflection.\nY,force component along the direction\nof the Y axis.\nL , rolling-moment component.\nN , yawing-moment component.\n6La=Llmkx2,Control moments per unit moment of\n&Na=N/mkzz, inertia of airplane.\ny e Stability derivatives in terms of unit\nL, mass or moment of inertia of air-\n\n1\n\n1\n\nA number of secondary considerations will be neglected in the mathematical analysis of the problems\nto make the mathematical expressions as simple 8s\npossible and because it is not considered important to\nsecure exact numerical results for studying the general\nproblem. For these approximate calculations the\nlateral and longitudinal motions of the airplane will be\nconsidered separable during turning flight. A check\nof the maximum gyroscopic couples encountered shows\ndt\nIn order to express the foregoing ideas defkitely it that they are negligible for the present study, although\nwill be necessary to resort to mathematical treatment it is probable that the longitudinal and lateral oscillaof the motions. It is convenient for this purpose to tions in turning flight can be separated for only a\nchoose a set of axes rigidly h e d in the airplane a t its relatively short time after the passing of a disturbance.\ncenter of gravity and inclined a t the angle of attack a, Another assumption-made is that the effect of a comso that the X axis points into the direction of the ponent torque applied to the airplane is an angular\nrelative wind in steady flight at the specified lift co- acceleration about the axis of the torque. In general,\ne5cient. The following notation and diagram define the angular acceleration does not have the same axis\nas the applied torque but in the present case the referthe quantities used i the subsequent equations.\nn\nence axes chosen lie near the assumed principal axes of\ninertia, and the difference of moments of inertia. taken\nabout various axes i4 not great. In addition, the\nflight of the airplane is assumed to be horizontal and\nthe speed not to vary appreciably from the average\n(U,) in a given case.\nAccording to the previously outlined treatment, the\nmovement of the airplane in at least one of the lateral\ncoordinates will be m o a e d by a constraint. The\ncomplete set of three degrees of freedom is not in this\ncase expressed in the usual three simultaneous equations of motion, for this procedure would imply that\neach component of the motion was affected by the\nZ\nother two, whereas the present problem calls for an\nU,, forward (X-wise) velocity in steady independent expression of one of them. Thus, it is\nassumed that the available control is SuSSciently\nflight.\np , rolling component of angular veloc- powerful to force any desired motion in the controlled\ncomponent. When setting up the equations, this\nity.\n\n76\n\nA STUDY OF THE TWO-CONTROL OPERATION OF AN AIRPLANE\n\nmotion will be considered to be given as a function of\nthe time.\nIt is important to emphasize in the interpretation\nof the mathematical analysis the practical significance\nof the assumptions used. The solution of the equations requires that the complete history of the variation\nof one of the components of the motion (or the contral\nsetting) be known beforehand. This variation is not\nsubsequently altered to accommodate the variation of\nthe other motions as would be the case if an intelligent\npilot were a t the controls. It may be imagined that\nthe pilot has only one degree of attention. Having fixed\non a procedure of rolliig the airplane, he concentrates on\nthe execution of this alone, paying no attention to the\nconsequences in yawing or sideslipping. It would be\nfeasible to assume that the pilot concentrated his\nattention on carrying out a predetermined manipulation of the controls, without regard to any of the\nmotions set up. This assumption is, however, considered to be too far removed from actuality to be of\nmuch use in analyzing the problem. It would be of\nmore practical interest to assume that the pilot had\nsufficient skill to enforce a desired motion in every\nrespect, taking no account of the control manipulations.\nThe control manipulations required could then be\ncalculated and an idea of the degree of skill necessary\nto attain a perfect result could be derived therefrom.\nWith two-control operation a perfect coordination\nf\nof the motions is, of course, not possible. I the pilot\nenforces complete control over one component of the\nairplane\xe2\x80\x99s motion, h\xe2\x80\x98e must do so a t the expense of\ncontrol in some other component. The residual component is then considered to be free. In practice the\npilot can exercise an indirect influence on all lateral\nmotioas with only a single lateral control. Hence, it\nis possible to assume that a skilled pilot could enforce\ncomplete control over the yawing motion even though\nhis available control exerted only rolling moments\ndirectly. Then the rolling motion must be considered\nfree and not subject to the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s attention although\nhis available control operates directly on this motion.\nSuch an assumption obviously cannot give an accurate\ndescription of anything occurring in practice. The\nsame is true in some degree of any other assumed procedure that can be mathematically treated. The actual\nprocedure of a pilot is undoubtedly an indeterminate\nand variable synthesis of such elementary procedures.\nThe study of a single assumption of this nature is\ntherefore incomplete, constituting simply a part in the\nanalysis of the problem.\nIn order to illustrate the variety of assumptions\nthat may be treated, four equations, containing\nmovements both of the airplane and of the control\nsurface, will be set down:\n\n~-g\xe2\x80\x98p+~U0-vYv\ndv\n\n-0\n\n* - - - ~ L ~ - ~ L , - ~ L . - - G=O~\nL\ndt\n@-pNp-rNr-vN,-6N6=0\ndt\nda\na-p\n\n=O\n\nThese equations are to be satisfied simultaneously and,\nsince there are more variables than equations, one of\nthe variables must be given in terms of the time to\neffect a solution. Any assumption of the kind considered may be applied by setting one of the variables\nequal to a function of t . Thus the equations of motion\nwith an arbitrarily prescribed course in rolling are:\n\ndr\n---rN,-vN,,-6Na=\nNpp(t)\ndt\nSimilarly, if the pilot uses the control to enforce\nsome given motion in yawing, the equations are:\ndv\n--gp-VY,\ndt\n\n= - Uor(t)\n\n--pLpdP\nvLv- 6La= Lrr(t)\ndt\n-pN,-vN,--GNa= N A t )-z(t)\nd\nk p , 0\n\ndt\nSolutions of the foregoing differential equations have\nthe general form\nv,p16,or r=(CleAgf+C2eAz1+ .

The large real root (nearly equal to\nLp)indicates the sharp damping of an initial rolling\nmotion and is of such magnitude that the wings may\nbe considered to be in a measure constrained against\nroUing relatively to the air. A possible rolling motion,\nhowever, that will not be appreciably damped consists\nin rolling about an instantaneous center some distance\nabove the center of gravity of the airplane. For\nrotation of the airplane as a rigid body about this\npoint the rolling m m e n t due to sideslip will balance\nthe damping of the rolling.\' The height, Y L , of the\ninstantaneous center above the center of gravity is\nfound from:\nvLo=-pL,\nwhere\nv= -pz\nwhence\n- L =L\nP\nZ\nz\n(17)\nThe mode of motion represented by the small complex\nroots (table 111) thus consists in a swinging oscillation\nof the airplane about the metacenter 5 as a pendulum\nsuspended from that point. The characteristic roots\nfor the pendulum motion would be\n\n:ontrol or indirectly by rolling the airplane as a whole.\n[f the latter effect were used to constrain the yawing,\nthe resulting motion would be excessively unstable.\nrhus, in order to prevent a sidewise disturbance from\nyawing the airplane (r=O), the pilot must execute a roll\n3uch that the forward wing is depressed (pNp=-vNo).\nThis roll provides the occasion for an increase of side3lip due to the bank and requires, in turn, more rapid\nrolling so that the motion diverges quickly. Secondary\naileron yawing moments of either sign moderate this\ninstability and the motion may become stable if the\nyawing moment is favorable.\nThese considerations indicate that the pilot could\nnot maintain an exact yawing constraint by the use of\nailerons alone. On the other hand, this inability is\nprobably not of great importance since the assumption\nof piloting procedure is obviously artificial and since\nthe former calculations (stability with constraint in\nrolling) indicated that, if the ailerons were used to\nhold the wings level, the free yawing oscillationswould\nbe short and quickly damped. (See table 11.) Thus\nit appears that, in order to prevent any yawing whatever\nduring a disturbance, the pilot weuld have to execute a\ndivergent bank whereas if he merely held the wings\nlevel the yawing motion might be unnoticeable.

The X axis will be tangent to the flight\npath a t this point in rounding a turn, as shown in\nfigure 1.\nSimilar considerations apply in the case of operation\nwith a rolling-moment control with fixed rudder.\nHere the metacenter is for a vanishing yawing moment,\nthe amount of sideslip being that necessary for\nvN,=-rN,.\nThe distance of the metacenter aft of\nthe center of gravity is found from\nor\n\nAn interesting point arises in connection with the\nrelation of the two metacenters (5L and % N ) .

Obviously, the condition % N < Z L corresponds to instability since in this\ncase with either mode of two-control operation the\ncontrol setting during a steady turn would be one\nappropriate to recovery from the turn.

In any event,\nspiral stability, if present, must be considered as a\nsmall effect (with conventional airplanes) ; and the\ncontrol setting during steady turns is, if positive,\nalmost certain to be small so that secondary moments\nwill have little effect. (See fig. 4, CL=0.35.)\n\nTWO-CONTROL OPERATION IN UNSTEADY TURNS\n\nThe consideration of the equilibrium state is sufficient for the study of conditions during slowly executed\nmaneuvers of sufficient duration for the natural free\noscillations of the airplane to die out. In the case of\nrapid maneuvers performed by more or less quick\nmovements of the control the equilibrium conditions\nconare of secondary importance and the primsideration is the oscillation and damping of the free\nmotion.\nAccording to the previously outlined treatment, the\nmotions of the two-control airplane set up during unsteady turns will be studied by considering a constraint\nimpressed on the motion in the particular coordinate\nin which the available control operates. Thus in one\ncase of rudder control a d e h i t e sequence of yawing\nmotions appropriate to the turn maneuver under consideration will be assumed. The free rolling motion\nthat the airplane takes up during the manewer wilf\nthen be studied and compared with the rolling motion\nthat would be considered appropriate for the execution of the maneuver.\nThe investigation of unsteady conditions during\nvarious maneuvers required that the equations of motion (equations (1) to (3)) be solved for different types\nand variations of the impressed disturbances. The first\nstep in the procedure consisted in obtahimg solutions\nof the equations for (\xe2\x80\x98unit disturbances\xe2\x80\x9d substituted\ninto each coordinate of freedom.\nThe unit disturbance is defined by\n1 ( t ) =O when t<O\n1 (t) =1 when t>O\n\n1\n\n(see reference 3 ) and is taken to represent a disturbing\nacceleration of unit magnitude applied instantly a t\n\nt=O.\nThe solutions of the equations of motion for this\ntype of disturbance were found by methods described\nin reference 4.

Thus the curves given i figure 5 were\nn\nused to End the motions due to a varying angle of bank\nby means of Carson\'s integral (33).

Figure 8 is of interest in illustrating the\ntwo more or lcss distinct modes of motion in free rolling\nand sideslipping. It will be noted that the rolling\nstarts very rapidly (with an initial angular acceleration of one radian per second per second) but soon\ntakes up the slow swinging oscillation.

This\nmethod would serve directly to reduce the sideslipping\nto a minimum both in steady turning and in rapidly\nexecuted turn maneuvers. Figure 15 shows the effect\nof doubling N , on the yawing motion during the maneuver performed at C,=l.O. This modification of the\nairplane shortened the natural period of the oscillation\nand resulted in the yawing action taking place more\nquickly. The effect on sideslip is shown in figure 16.\n5\nAlthough the maneuver ends with about \' of outward\nsideslip, this value will be quickly reduced to zero on\naccount of the natural stability of the motion. With\ndifferent timing of the maneuver it may, of course, be\nbrought to an end with no residual sideslip.

It may be expected, however,\nthat this undesirable tendency could be overcome by\nproperly proportioning the dihedral of the wings. The\ngreatest possible effect of increase of vertical-fin area\nwould be to cause the metacenter for yawing moments\nGN (see discussion of stability) to approach coincidence\nwith the fin; it would then appear necessary to arrange\nthe metacenter for rolling moments ahead of this point\nin order to accommodate any desired increase of verticalEn area and secure spiral stability.\n\n88\n\nnormal flight, since they represent the use of a large\nproportion of the control power ordinarily available at\nthe lower speeds. With slower maneuvers the coordination of the motions of the two-control airplane would\nbe expected to be much better, especially when the\nduration of the maneuver becomes large relative to the\nnatural period of oscillation of the airplane. Figure 17\nshows the result of a calculation in which the duration\nof the 6.28-second maneuver was doubled.\nIt is worth noting that the actual deflection of the\nflight path of an airplane relative to the earth is accomplished much more directly by banking than by steering.\nRegardless of tbe sideslipping and coordination of angular motions, any decided acceleration of the path must\nbe brought about by inclination of the lift and is not\ndirectly affected to any great extent by rotating the\nairplane in yaw. Such deflection of the path would be\nthe principal objective in turning to avoid an obstacle.\nThus the airplane with rolling-moment control should\nbe capable of avoiding obstacles equally as quickly 8s a\nconventional three-control airplane. As is the case\nwith three-control operation, the tendency of a twocontrol airplane to accelerate downward when banked\nmust be counteracted by a movement of the elevator.\nI the airplane is assumed to execute a sharp turn to\nf\navoid an obstacle, the primary consideration will thus\nbe the ability to produce a specified bank. Under such\n\nA STUDY OF THE TWO-CONTROL OPERATION OF AN AIRPLANE\n\nconditions the pilot of the rudder-operated airplane\nwould be expected to make an effort at indirect control\nof the bank without regard to the coordination of the\nyawing motion. The question then arises as to what\nyawing motion would have to be prescribed in the case\nof the rudder-controlled machine to enforce the desired\nmotion in banking.\nFigure 18 shows the yawing motion that results in a\nbank curve similar to that given in figure 9. It appears\nthat, in order to attain the bank angle as shown, a\nrelatively powerful rudder control would have to be\napplied about one-half second in advance of the usual\nstart of the turn. Further calculations showed that the\nprescribed yawing motion could be attained throughout\nif a rather large amount of rudder control were avail-\n\notion is too slow and the damping is too slight to\ntable even an approximate coordination of the mom s Within the short time of duration of the maneuver.\nFigure 21 shows the angles of sideslip attained with\nte various modes of operation considered, summarizing\nte results of the calculations.\nThe reasons for the inability of the rudder-controlled\nrplane to execute rapid turns are: First, that the\nrcondary rolling reaction due to yawing motion is\nsufficient to overcome the relatively great damping\n\' direct rolling motion; second, that for a rapid turn\nle rate of rolling required on entry and recovery\n-eatly exceeds the maximum rate of yawing; and third,\niat the free rolling and sideslipping oscillations set up\n*enot very well damped.

That such an attempt to follow a definite course\nin banking would require a vigorous use of the rudder\nis evident from the oscillation of the yawing curve.\nIn the case of two-control operation with a constraint\nin yawing by means of the rudder, the yawing motions\nshown in figure 9 were assumed and the resulting\nfree rolling motions were calculated. Figures 19 and\n20 show the results of such calculations made a t different lift coefficients. The angles of bank and rates of\nrolling attained are compared with those that would\nbe appropriate to the constrained yawing motion.\nIt is apparent from these and the preceding figures\nthat the two-control airplane operated with the rudder\ncannot be expected to perform rapid maneuvers of the\ntype considered.

This effect would be\nespecially apparent if the rudder were applied in such\na way as to enforce indirectly a desired banking motion. Such indirect control requires, however, that the\nrudder be deflected in advance of the desired effect.\nThe yawing that arises when the bank is indirectly\ncontrolled with the rudder is a very poor approximation to the ideal yawing and calls for large and irregular\ncontrol movements.\nThe amount of sideslipping during steady turns is\nnot greatly different with either mode of operation. In\neither case it appears desirable that the free motion of\nthe airplane show spiral stability so that control settings\nopposing the turn will not be required.\nIn general, it is concluded that a reliable rollingmoment control that does not give a secondary adverse\nyawing moment would afford the most satisfactory\nmeans for two-control operation. It appears that a\nmoderate amount of favorable secondary yaw would\nbe desirable although certain disadvantages appear if\nthe proportion is too great.\nThe disadvantage in two-control operation lies not\nso much in the imperfection of control of the flight path\nof the airplane relative to the earth as in the sideslipping\nand sidewise accelerations that arise through the imperfect coordination of the yawing and banking\nmotions. It appears possible that this tendency may\nbe so reduced by the use of suitable control organs\nand properly modified stability characteristics as to\nbe unobjectionable.\n\nThe lateral motion of a conventional airplane is more\nstable when constrained in rolling than when constrained i yawing. The stability of the free yawing\nn\nm d sideslipping motion is greater than that of the\nentirely free motion; the stability of the free rolling\nand sideslipping is less than that of the entirely free\nmotion.\nI a rolling-moment control is used to enforce an\nf\narbitrary constraint in banking, the free yawing that\nresults will be approximately coordinated to the bank\nif the airplane has the average degree of weathercock\nstability (N.). The yawing in this case is also approximately adjusted to the speed of flight so that\nwith a given bank maneuver a more rapid rate of\nyawing is attained a t low speed than a t high speed, as\nis desirable. The deviation of the yawing from the\nideal is greater, however, a t lower speeds and is also\ngreater in quick turns than in more slowly executed\nf\nones. I the rolling control were designed to give a\nmoderate favorable yawing moment, the coordination\nof the motions would be improved. Improvement may\nalso be effected by increasing the weathercock stability. If, however, the aileron control gives the usual\nproportion of secondary adverse yawing moment, the\ncoordination of the yawing with the banking will be\nrelatively very poor. The motions may then become\nunstable and uncontrollable in an extreme case a t high\nlift coefficient. These latter statements are particularly\napplicable to conventional-type ailerons which are\nconsidered as undesirable on this account for use at\nlow flight speed unless compensated by the rudder.\nA rudder control may be used to enforce a constraint LANGLEY\nMEMORIAL\nAERONAUTICAL\nLABORATORY,\ne\'ther directly on the yawing motion or indirectly on\nFOR\nNATIONAL\nADVISORY\nCOMMITTEE AERONAUTICS,\nthe rolling motion provided that the maneuver specified\nLANGLEY\nFIELD,\nVA.,August 18,1936.\nis not too rapid nor the disturbances encountered too\nREFERENCES\nsevere.

In many cases, however,\ndevices that produced what seemed to be satisfactory\nrolling moments and favorable yawing moments did\nnot give satisfactory control.\nAn analytical study of control effectiveness was\ntherefore made (reference 4) taking into account a\nnumber of secondary factors, including the yawing\nmoments produced by the controls, the effect of the\ncontrols on the damping in rolling, the lateral-stability\nderivatives of the airplane, the moments of inertia, and\nthe time required for the control moments to become\nestablished after the deflection of the surfaces. The\ncomputations consisted of step-by-step solutions of the\nequations of rolling and yawing motion for the conditions following a deflection of the controls. The results\nof these computations based on aerodynamic data obtained from wind-tunnel tests of wings incorporating\nvarious devices agreed satisfactorily with the results\nmeasured in flight for widely different forms of control,\nsuch as ailerons and spoilers.\nThe study of conditions above the stall indicated\nthat satisfactory control could not be expected without\nsome provision to maintain the damping in rolling and\nthat a dangerous type of instability would arise if the\ndamping were insufficient. Since damping in rolling\ndepends on an increase in the lift of the airfoil with\nincreasing angle of attack, it follows that, in order to\nobtain satisfactory lateral control, the outer or tip portions of the wing, which govern the rolling moments,\nmust remain unstalled. If damping in rolling is retained, it is practically insured that control moments\nwill be retained as well.\nThe progress of the investigation has thus led to a\nmore accurate interpretation of the results of the windtunnel tests. In the present paper the experience\ngained during the c o m e of the investigation is made\nINTRODUCTION\nthe basis of a revised method of comparison of lateral\nIn 1931 the Committee started a systematic wind- control devices. Wind-tunnel measurements of control\ntunnel investigation of lateral control with special and stability factors (reference 1) are utilized in conireference to the improvement of control at low air putations to show the banking and yawing motions\nspeeds and a t high angles of attack. Many different that would be produced by the controls acting on a\nailerons and other lateral control devices have been small typical airplane. These computations follow the\n.\nsubjected to the same systematic investigation in the method of analysis given in reference 4 In section I of\n7- by 10-foot wind tunnel. (See reference 1.) The the report the new basis of comparison is explained and\n\nAn analysis of the principal results of recent N. A . C. A.\nlateral control research is made by utilizing the experience\nand progress gained during the course of the investigation.\nTwo things are considered of primary importance in\njudging the effectiveness o f diferent control devices: The\n(calcuhted) banking and yawing motion of a typical small\nairplane caused by a deJlection of the control, and the stick\nforce required to produce this dejlection. The report includes a table in which a number of different lateral control\ndevices are compared on these bases.\nExperience gained while testing various devices in\nJlight with a Fairchild 22 airplane indicated that, following a sudden deJlection of the control at low speed, an\nangle o f bank of 15" in 1 second represented a satisjactory\nminimum degree of effectiveness for this size of airplane.\nSome devices capable o f giving this degree of control were,\nhowever, considered to be not entirely satisfactory on account o f sluggishness in starting the motion. Devices\nlocated near the trailing edge of the wings had no detectable\nsluggishness. Lateral control forces considered, desirable\nby the test pilots varied f r o m 2 to 8 pounds; 16 pounds was\nconsidered excessive.\nTest Jlights demonstrated that satisfactory lateral control\nat high angles of attack depends as much on the retention o j\nstability as on aileron effectiveness.\nThe aerodynamic characteristics of plain sealed ailerons\ncould be accurately predicted by a modifiation of the\naerodynamic theory utilizing the results of experiments\nwith sealed jlaps. straight narrow-chord sealed ailerons\ncovering 60 to 80 percent o f the semispan represented about\nthe most escient arrangement of plain unbalanced ailerons\nfrom cons&rations of operating force. The stick force of\nplain ailerons can be effectively reduced by the use of a\ndijerential linkage in conjunction with a small $xed tab\narranged to press the ailerons upward.\n\n119\n\nREPORT MO. 605-NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\na number of the devices that were tested in reference 1\nare analyzed and compared. The principal items of\ncomparison are collected into a table. Section I1\npresents an analysis of the rolling, yawing, and hinge\nmoments of plain flap-type ailerons and deals with the\napplication of these data in the design of control\nsystems.\n\nI. COMPARISON OF LATERAL CONTROL\nDEVICES\nREVISED BASIS OF COMPARISON\nAIRPLANE USED I N COMPAEIISON\n\nThe procedure adopted in the lateral control investigation has comprised a wind-tunnel test program followed by fhght tests of the different devices on the\nFairchild 22 airplane. Not all of the devices tested\nin reference 1 have been tried in flight, however, and\nthe present report may be considered an analytical\nextension of the flight-test procedure that was applied\nto some of the devices. The procedure employed to\ntest lateral controls in flight is simulated by means of\ncomputation. Thus, the comparative criterions used\nherein are based on application of the devices to a hypothetical Fairchild 22 type of airplane, which is the type\nused in the fhght tests.\nThe Fairchild 22 airplane was necessarily somewhat\nmodifled for each different flight test and wings of different moment of inertia, plan form, and section were\nused in some cases. The wing of the hypothetical airplane assumed in the computations represents an average of the tested wings. Furthermore, since the characteristic ratios of dimensions (tail length, tail area,\nradii of gyration about various axes, etc.) used agree\nvery closely with statistical averages of these quantities, the assumed airplane may be considered to embody\naverage stability characteristics. The principal characteristics of the assumed airplane are as follows:\n\ndesirable value to attain. Where a compromise must\nbe made between the rolling moment and some other\ncharacteristic of the control system, particularly the\ncontrol force, a decidedly lower valueof the rolling\ncriterion may be used. It appears that a value posdbly as low as half the original one may be found\nreasonably satisfactory for practically all conditions of\nsight with nonacrobatic airplanes.\nThe criterion of rolling control used in the present\nanalysis is the angle of bank attained in 1 second following a sudden deflection of the control. This criterion\nshows the actual amount of motion produced and\ndepends on both the acceleration at the start and the\nfinal rate of roll. It includes the effect of yawing\nmoment given by the control as well as the stability\ncharacteristics and moments of inertia of the airplane.\nThe values of the criterion are found by computation\nand as such are applicable only to the particular type\nof airplane (F-22) that has been assumed.\nExperience gained in flight tests of the Fairchild 22\nairplane with various lateral control devices indicated\na minimum satisfactory amount pf rolling control corresponding to about 15\' of bank in 1 second.

At the start of\nthe wind-tunnel investigation of lateral control devices\nrepresent(reference 1) a rolling criterion (RC= C,/CL)\ning a conservative lower liiit of rolling control for all\ntypes was assumed. The assumed satisfactory value\nof the rolling criterion was 0.075, which corresponds to\na lateral movement of the center of pressure of 7.5\npercent of the wing span. Recent experience indicates\nthat this value is likely to be ample for any condition\nof fllght that might be encountered and is therefore a\n\n120\n\nFIGURE\nl.-Banking of Fairchild 22 airplane after sudden deflection of lateral oontrol devices at low speed. (The narrow plain ailerons and the retractable ailerons\nwere considered to give a satisfactory amount of control; the floating-tipailerons\nwere reported as weak.)\n\nat low speed have been found reasonably satisfactory\nin practice with this type of airplane. Owing to the\npresent general use of high-lift flaps on airplane wings,\nthe size and deflection of ailerons are usually determined by the low-speed condition of flight witb the\nflaps deflected. For comparative computations, in the\npresent report, a lift coefficient of CL=1.8 is assumed as\nrepresentative of the low-speed condition of flight with\n\nRaSUMa AND ANALYSIS OF N. A.\n\nflaps. The sizes or deflections of the lateral controls\nare selected in each case to give an angle of bank of 15\xe2\x80\x99\nin 1 second a t CL=1.8.\nIn addition to providing a suflicient amount of banking motion, two further desirable characteristics of the\nrolling action are: (1) The response of the airplane in\nroll to any movement of the lateral control surface\nshould be immediate, any noticeable delay or hesitac\ntion in the action being objectionable; and (2) the\naction should be so graduated that the acceleration and\nmaximum rate of roll increase smoothly and regularly\nas the stick deflection is increased. Conventional\nailerons or similar lateral control devices located near\nthe trailing edge of the Wing easily meet these requirements and show, in analyses of motions recorded in\nflight, practically instantaneous response of rolling\nacceleration to control-surface movement. From 0.1\nto 0.2 second is ordinarily required to deflect the\nsurfaces and, during this interval, the rolling acceleration apparently keeps pace, although only a slight\namount of rolling motion is accumulated by the time\nof full deflection. Comparison shows that good\nsynchronization of the calculated motion with the flight\nrecords was obtained when the assumed full deflection\nwas taken a t the instant the actual deflection reached\nhalf its ultimate value. This assumption was used\nin the computations for plain ailerons and other\ndevices t,hat gave no indication of sluggish rssponse\ncharacteristics.\nCONTROL FORCE\n\nDuring the course of the lateral control investigation\nit became apparent that the force required to move tht\ncontrols is of extreme importance in obtaining satisfactory lateral control. As shown by the flight tests oj\nreferences 2 and 3, an airplane that requires a lighl\ncontrol force is likely to seem more controllable to a\npilot than one that requires a heavy control force, ever\nthough with full deflection the heavier control may bt\n1\nconsiderably more powerful than the lighter one. 1\nseems desirable to have the control force as light as pos\nsible and yet to maintain the feeling of a definite new\ntral position. This characteristic is especially impor.\ntant in the aileron control since the effort expended ir\nmoving the stick sidewise is relatively greater than foi\nother control movements. (See reference 5.) Correla.\ntion of test-flight reports and control-force records indi.\ncates that the forces required to operate the aileron2\nshould not exceed about 8 pounds in order to be con.\nsidered desirable. A lower limit of stick force of aboui\n2 pounds a t full deflection is apparently considerec\nessential so that there may be a noticeably regulatec\nincrease of force with deflection. Friction of the con\ntrol mechanism plays an increasingly important pari\nas the operating force is reduced and should in no cast\nbe great enough to mask the \xe2\x80\x9cfeel\xe2\x80\x9d of the control. I\nis probabIe that with sufficiently little friction a forcc\nnot greatly in excess of 2 pounds would be considerec\n\n4. LATERAL CONTROL RESEARCH\n\nnost desirable. A force of 15 pounds i to be consids\nred excessive.\nAs previously stated, the size or maximum deflection\nI f the control devices compared in this paper have\nn\nIeen selected to give an angle of bank of 15\xe2\x80\x99 i 1 secmd following full deflection and, considering the avertge airplane fitted with a high-lift flap and flying at a\nift coefficient of 1.8, the ailerons are compared (see\n#able I) on the basis of the stick force required to\ntttain this angle of bank of 15\xe2\x80\x99 in 1 second at lift\n:oefficients of 0.35, 1.0, and 1.8, which compose the\nisual flight range. The lift coefficient of 0.35 repreients the conditions of high-speed and cruising flight.\nFhe lift coefficient of 1.0 is considered to represent two\n:onditions, the first being that of low-speed Gght with)ut a flap, such as is used in an approach to a landing\nKith an unflapped airplane, and the second being one\nKith a flap fully deflected, which represents as high a\n;peed as is usually attained in that condition. The\nralue C,=1.8 can be obtained only with the flap delected and represents the low-speed flight condition\nKith the high-lift device in use. Whqn representative\nd u e s of this nature are used, it is necessary to examne the complete original data to show that the critical\nd u e s are representative of conditions throughout the\nlight range. Such an examination has been made for\n;he comparisons of the present report.\nThe stick force for a 15\xe2\x80\x99 bank in 1 second is used as\nthe basis of comparison at all flight speeds and lift co3fficients even though the conventional ailerons will\nproduce a decidedly greater bank in 1 second at higher\n3peeds. The 15\xe2\x80\x99 value is taken throughout because it\ni considered to represent the maximum control likely\ns\nto be used in ordinary flight at any speed and is there[ore of greater interest as a basis for stick forces repired than the maximum possible deflection, as long\nBS the force at maximum deflection does not approach\nthe strength of the pilot\xe2\x80\x98\nThe data for some of the ailerons were obtained with\nplain unflapped wings with which a lift coefficient of 1.8\ncould not be attained and, in order to have all the\nlateral control devices on a comparable basis whether\nmounted on flapped or unflapped wings, their sizes and\nmaximum deflections were selected to give essentially\nthe same rolling effect as the others at a lift coefficient\nof 1.0. The analysis showed that conventional ailerons\nwhich give an angle of bank of 15\xe2\x80\x99 in 1 second on a\nflapped wing a t a lift coefficient of 1.8 could, when\nfully deflected, give an angle of bank of 22.5\xe2\x80\x99 with the\nflap retracted a t a lift coefficient of 1.0. The ailerons\non the unflapped wings were therefore selected to be\ncapable of giving 22.5\xe2\x80\x99 bank in 1 second at a lift coefficient of 1.0, but the values of the stick forces required\nwere computed for partial deflections giving a 15\xe2\x80\x99 bank\nin 1 second a t lift coefficients of both 1.0 and 0.35. The\n&st aileron of table I is of the conventional unbalanced\nflap type on a rectangular wing of aspect ratio 6. It\nhas a chord 0.25 e, and a span 0.40 b12 and has equal\n\n121\n\nREPORT NO. 605-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nup-and-down linkage. It w i l l be noted that, for an airplane equipped with these ailerons, the stick force computed for a 15O bank in 1 second at the cruising-flight\ncondition is 4.7 pounds with aileron deflections of only\nf3.4O. At a lift coefficient of 1.0, representing the lowspeed flight condition for the unflapped wing, the same\namount of control was obtained with a stick force of\n3.6 pounds and aileron deflections of f7.4O. Al the\nl\nstick forces are given for an assumed aileron linkage\nsuch that at the maximum deflection the control stick,\nwhich has a length of 20 inches on the Fairchild 22\nairplane and is so assumed for the average airplane, is\ndeflected 2 O from neutral. The maximum aileron\n5\ndeflection is 11.2O and is the deflection required to\nproduce a bank of 22.5\xe2\x80\x99 in 1 second at CL=l.O. Here\nthe ailerons are not being taxed to their fullest extent.\nThe maximum amount of control specified in a design\nhas a predominating effect on the operating force.\nFigure 2 shows a calculated example of the variation of\n\nin which the increase of control is obtained, as will be\nmore fully developed in a later section.\nYAWING MOTION AND SIDESLIP\n\nThe effect of the yawing moment produced by the\nailerons is considered in two ways. First, the secondary\neffect of yaw on the rolling motions is inherently included in the computed banking effectiveness. Thus,\nthe bank in 1 second is that produced by the ailerons\nf\nwithout aid from the rudder. I it is assumed that a\nsufficiently powerful rudder were used in such a way\nas to prevent sideslip, a given aileron device would,\nin general, produce a somewhat greater banking effect.\nThis assumption is not used here, however, and the\ndeflections of the control surfaces given in table I are\nthose required to produce the specified angle of bank in\n1 second with the particular combination of rolling and\nyawing moments produced by the aileron in question.\nThe second effect considered is the sideslip produced\nby the sudden use of the aileron control for banbing.\nIn flight the rudder is used to avoid sideslipping and\nthe amount of rudder action necespary for this purpose\nis in direct proportion to the sideslip incurred by the\nailerons alone.\nThe angle of sideslip accompanying a 15O bank in 1\nsecond following the sudden displacement of the lateral\ncontrols is also given in table I. The first aileron\nlisted, it w i l l be noted, produces a sideslip of 7 O at CL=\n1.0 and of 3 O at CL=0.35 when the rudder is not used\nto correct for this condition.\nLATERAL STABILITY\n\nMffximum anqfe of bonk h I sec, AMs,\ndeg.\nbetween stick force and maximum amount of control obtained.\nFairchild 22 type sirplane; 0.80 sealed ailerons deflected f20\xe2\x80\x9d;aileron chord\nvaried.\n\nFIGURE\n2.-Relation\n\noperating force with specified control in which it was\nassumed that ailerons with equal up-and-down motion\nand the most efficient length and deflection ( & Z O O )\nwere used in each case.

The angle of bank 4, is the\nangle that would be produced by the control operating\non the average airplane. The effect of a given control\non an airplane of greatly different lateral-stability\ncharacteristics might, of course, be considerably different\nthan indicated in this case.\nOne of the most important factors in the interaction\nof lateral stability and control below the stall is the\neffect of the secondary yawing moment induced by the\ncontrol and an allowance for this effect should be made in\nthe proportioning of the airplane for lateral stability.\nModifications that tend to increase spiral stability in\nfree flight (namely, reduced vertical-fin area and increased dihedral) tend to render the airplane uncontrollable under the action of ailerons giving adverse\nyawing moment. The degree of \xe2\x80\x9cweathercock\xe2\x80\x9d stability\nshould be sufIicient to restore the airplane from a yawed\nattitude when the wings are held level by use of the\nailerons. For safety in this respect the ratio of adverse\nyawing to rolling moment given by the ailerons should\nnot be allowwl to approach the ratio of yawing to rolling moments that naturally act on the airplane either\n\nRfiSUME AND ANALYSIS OF N. A. C. A, LATERAL CONTROL RESEARCH\n\nin pure sideslipping or pure yawing motion. (See\nreference 6.)\nOne of the lateral-stability factors, the damping in\nrolling, has been shown by the analysis in reference 4 to\nhave a critical effect on the controllability obtained,\nsatisfactorylateral control requiring that positive damping exist. Since the damping in rolling depends on a\npositive slope of the left curve, the damping exists only\na t angles of attack of the outer portions of the wing that\nare below the maximum lift coefficient. While some\nsemblance to control may be obtained a t angles of\nattack above the stall if controls giving favorable yawing moments as well as sufsciently powerful rolling\nmoments are used, the instability associated with\nuneven stalling and autorotation is so violent that it is\nnecessary for the pilot to use the controls continually to\nf\nkeep the airplane near the desired attitude. I s a ciently rapid rolling is once started, either by the controls\nthemselves or as the result of gusty air, it cannot be\nstopped. The angle of attack at which the damping in\nrolling becomes zero and above which autorotation takes\nplace CY^,=^) is used herein as an indication of the\nlimit of the flight attitude above which satisfactory\nlateral control cannot be obtained. This value was\ngiven in the reports of reference 1 for both the angle of\nattack at which autorotation was selfstarting and the\nangle of attack at which the damping became zero when\nthe wing was rotating at the rate pb/2V=0.05, a value\nrepresentativeof the rolling likely to be caused by gusty\nair. The latter value of CY has ordinarilybeen found to be\nabout lo lower than the former value and, being therefore more decisive, is used in the present report. The\ndifference between the angle of attack for zero damping\nand the angle of attack for the maximum lift coefficient\nof the entire wing (CYL,=O-LYC,,,~.) has been tabulated\nunder Lateral Stability to show whether the maximum\nlift coefficient can be expected to be reached in flight\nbefore satisfactory lateral control is lost. It will be\nnoted that for ailerons 3 and 4 the wing loses its damping in roll at an angle of attack lo higher than that at\nwhich the maximum lift coefficient is reached. Thus, as\nfar as the stabilitJT is concerned, lateral control should\nbe possible throughout the entire unstalled-flight range,\nincluding the angle of attack for maximum lift coefficient.\nWING PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS\n\nThe same criterions used throughout the reports of\nreference 1 to show the relative performance characteristics of the wings are used in the present report and\nare tabulated in the last three columns of table I.\nThe maximum lift coefficient CL,., is given as an\nindication of the wing area required for a desired minimum speed. The ratio CL,JCb,,mis an indication of\nthe speed range and, for a given minimum speed, shows\nthe relative effects of the wings on the maximum speed\nattainable. The ratio LID taken at a value of the lift\ncoefficient CL=0.70 is an indication of relative merit i\nn\n\nclimbingflight. In a series of performancecomputations\nmade for airplanes of different wing loadings and power\nloadings and with both plain and slotted wings, this\ncriterion was found to be satisfactory throughout the\nentire range. It should be noted that the comparative\nvalues used in the present report are baaed on tests made\nin the 7- by 10-foot atmospheric wind tunnel and hence\ndo not coincide in absolute value with results of testa\nmade at Merent Reynolds Numbers.\nAPPLICATION TO AIRPLANES OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND LOADINGS\n\nBecause the ilight experience that led to the specscation of a satisfactory degree of control was restricted\nto the Fairchild 22 type of airplane, there is some doubt\nabout the application of this experience to other types\nand especially to large or very small airplanes. The\nFairchild 22 type of airplane, of course, serves as well\nas any other when different aileron devices are simply\ncompared among themselves. The principles governing the extension of the computations of motion to\ngeometrically similar airplanes of dserent sizes and\nloadings are well known and can be applied here, but\nthis extension of the computations does not definitely\nanswer the question as to what constitutes a satisfactory\ndegree of control for large (or very small) airplanes.\nAccording to the principles of dynamical similarity,\nlarge or small similar airplanes of the same wing loading\nwould show the same linear rise and fall of the wing\ntips(%)\n\nduring a 1-second banking motion. Large\nand small airplanes do actually show a tendency toward\nsimilarity in important dimensions and size of control\nsurfaces, and it seems logical to assume that a given\nvalue of the vertical distance described by the wing\ntips within 1 second following a sudden control deflection that represents a satisfactory amount of control\nfor the Fairchild 22 airplane should be satisfactory for\nany size of airplane.\nFor similar airplanes the linear distance described\n\n(q)\n\nby the wing tips in banking\nis independent of\nthe size. Figure 3 shows this distance plotted against\nwing loading and gives the separate effects of rolling\nand yawing moments of coefficient 0.01 at different\nlift coefficients. The banking effect of any combination\nof rolling and yawing moment may be found by\nsuperposition, i. e.,\n\nThe ordinates of the figure give directly the circumferential displacement of the wing tip in feet for a\nunit of 0.01 rolling- or yawing-moment coefficient.\nIt is important to note that the banking effects of\nrolling and yawing moments can be separately considered and later added in any desired proportion to\nobtain the totaI combined effect.\n\n123\n\nREPORT NO. 605-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nThe computations show that, in general, smaller\nvalues of the control-moment coefficients are required\nto produce a given wing-tip displacement in a unit of\ntime for the more heavily loaded airplanes. Another\npoint of interest in connection with the secondary\nadverse yawing moments produced by conventional-\n\nis assumed for each point. Figure 4 shows that the\nstick force required to obtain a given angle of bank in 1\nsecond is practically the same for all wing loadings up\nto 10 pounds per square foot but that it increases\nsomewhat as the wing loading increases further.\nWith moderately large airplanes, somewhat higher\nstick forces are apparently tolerated by pilots without\nserious objection. With extremely large airplanes,\nhowever, the operating force becomes too great to be\nsatisfactorily overcome by the pilot and either servo\ncontrols or auxiliary power is required. With auxiliary power, the pilot might presumably operate a valve\nor easily deflected controller governing a special power\n\nt!\n\n9\n\n$f\nx\nw\n\n.?\nx\'\n2\n\nz\n\n0\n\n/O\n\n20\n\n30\n\nW i n g /oadinq, /b.per sq. ff.\nFIQURE\n4.--Relstion hetween the wing loading and the stick force required for a\ngiven amount of control ( + 1 ~ , , = 2 2 5 ~ ;C~=1.0).\n\nsource that deflected the control surfaces.

At the high-speed condition, however,\nthe 0.40 e, by 0.30 b/2 aileron requires a rather high\nstick force, even with the best differential.\nThe sideslip incurred by an a q l e of bank of 15O i\nn\n1 second is not greatly different for the different aileron\nplan forms either with or without differential linkages.\nThe values are sIightly lower a t CL=l .O with the differential linkages than with the equal up-and-down, and\nwith the 0.25 c, by 0.40 b/2 plan form than with either\nof the others.\nIt is possible by methods to be described in section 1\n1\nto compute an optimum size of the aileron, i. e., the size\ngiving the desired amount of control with the least stick\nforce. The effect of varying the aileron span and chord\nis shown in figure 5, the chord for each span value being\n\n3tick forces are obtained with narrower chords. The\nnarrower ailerons require greater deflections and the\nreduction in chord size is limited by the fact that\ndeflections greater than about f 2 0 \xc2\xb0 are inefficient.\nMarked separation of the air flow takes place a t about\nthis angle of deflection on all the conventionalflap-type\nailerons tested and, as shown by the typical curves of\nfigure 6, the rolling-moment coefficients increase at a\nlower rate beyond 20\' deflection.

From this\nfigure it is apparent that with equal up-and-down deflection an aileron span of 80 percent of the wing semispan\nwill give the lowest stick force, but the variation is small\nfor ailerons between 60 percent and 100 percent of the\nwing semispan. Other computations not shown lead\nto the same conclusion for ailerons having differential\nlinkages.\nThe relations of aileron chord and span, considering\nespecially that the hinge moment increases with the\nsquare of the chord while the rolling moment increases\nonly as the square root of the chord, are such that lower\n\nreduce further the chord of the aileron by extending the\ndeflection beyond this bkeak, the stick force will be\nhigher because of the loss in mechanical advantage.\nFigure 5 illustrates this point, for when an aileron\ndeflection of f25O is assumed, narrower ailerons are\nrequired but the stick force is larger for all aileron spans\nthan with a deflection of f20\xc2\xb0.\nAileron 5 (table I) represents the narrowest sealed\naileron covering 80 percent of the wing semispan that\ngives the required control with a deflection of f20\xc2\xb0.\nThe aileron chord in this case is only 5.3 percent of the\nwing chord, and the stick forces are lower than for any\nof the previous ailerons. I a differential motion is\nf\nused, a somewhat wider aileron is required. With\nnarrow ailerons the floating angle is very small, and a\ntab is required to make the ailerons float at a sufliciently high angle that the differential linkage will be\neffectivein reducing the stick force. (See reference 11.)\nAileron 6 of table I is the smallest one covering 80\npercent of the semkpan that will give the required\n\n12-72\n823-\n\n125\n\nREPORT NO. 60.5-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\namount of control with a differential motion and with\nsuitable aileron tabs. The assumed tab covers the\nentire trailing edge of the ailerons, has a chord 1.5\npercent of the wing chord, and is permanently bent\ndownward 14\'. For this case the entire aileron chord\nincluding the tab is 7.8 percent of the wing chord and\nthe stick force is only 0.5 pound for the high-speed\ncondition and 0.1 for low speed.\nThese values of stick force are lower than are considered desirable for the Fairchild 22 airplane but are\ninteresting in showing the possibility of obtaining a\nsatisfactorily low stick force in larger and heavier\nairplanes. For small airplanes, one satisfactory method\nof increasing the stick force to the value desired would\nbe to use greater up travel than 20\' with differential\nailerons, thus getting into the range of inefficient stick\nforce although obtaining the advantage of slightly\nsmaller adverse yawing moments.\nIn many practical cases the chord of the aileron varies\nalong the span. Inasmuch as the hinge moment varies\nas the square of the chord and the control effectiveness\nonly about as the square root of the chord of an aileron\nelement, the stick force required to give a certain\nf\namount of control is inherently greater if the chord o\nthe aileron varies appreciably along the span. This\nrelation is true in spite o the fact that the portion of\nf\nthe aileron nearer the tip of the wing has a greater\nlever arm, which suggests that it might be advantageous\nto increase the chord of the aileron as the wing tip is\napproached. Thus, it is possible to state as a general\nrule that to obtain the lowest stick force, ailerons should\nhave an essentially constant chord over their entire\nspan.\'\nOn wings having rounded tips it is sometimes the\npractice to me ailerons having skewed hinge axes like\naileron 7 in table I. This aileron corresponds in span,\narea, and gap to the 0.25 co by 0.40 b/2 aileron 2, but\nthe stick force is decidedly higher for the skewed ailerons\non account of the variation of the aileron chord along\nthe span.\nAilerons 8 and 9 of table I are of tapered plan form\nand are mounted on tapered wings. In the computations of the rolling effect with the tapered wings the\nreduction in the moments of inertia due to the taper\nare taken into account. For example, for the wing\nwith 5: 1 taper, the value of Ixwas changed from 1,216\nslug-feet\' for the original average airplane to 860,\nand the value of Izfrom 1,700 to 1,400 slug-feet2. The\nlateral-stability derivatives were also changed to take\naccount of the taper. (See reference 4.)\nA cornparkon of ailerons 8 and 9 with aileron 1,\nwhich has the same relative chord size but is attached\nto a rectangular wing, shows that the stick force becomes lower aa the taper of t,he wing is increased. The\nsideslip or adverse yawing cdect is also smaller with\nthe tapered wings than with the rectangular.

It has been stated\nthat the lowest stick force would be obtained with\nconstant-chord ailerons. Computations have been\nmade comparing the straight or constant-chord ailerons\non a tapered wing with the ailerons that taper with the\nwing, and the results are shown in figure 7.

It is interesting to note\nthat with tapered ailerons the aileron span giving the\nlowest stick force is about half the wing semispan;\nwhereas with constant-chord ailerons the best aileron\nspan is 80 percent of the wing semispan, as it is in the\ncase of rectangular wings. Ailerons 10 and 11 are\nthe optimum sizes for the tapered and straight\nailerons, respectively, on a 511 tapered wing. With\nequal up-and-down deflections, the stick forces for the\nstraight ailerons are about half those for the tapered.\nIn either case the stick forces could be nearly counterbalanced by means of a suitable differential linkage and\n1\ntab, as will be developed more fully in section 1 .\nEffect of hinge gap.-Wind-tunnel\ntests have shown\ntbat even a slight gap between ordinary unbalanced\nailerons and the wing upon which they are mounted\n\nRfiSlJME AND ANALYSIS OF N. A. C. A. LATERAL CONTROL RESEARCH\n\ncauses a relatively large loss in rolling moment. This\nloss for unbalanced flaps having a gap of one thirtysecond inch on a wing of 10-inch chord was found to be\napproximately 30 percent. The hinge moment is also\nreduced by the gap but to a much lesser extent and the\nresultant stick force for a given amount of lateral control is greater because a larger aileron deflection is\nrequired, which necessitates a linkage having a poorer\nmechanical advantage. The effect on the stick force\nis shown in table I by a comparison of the values for\naileron 2, which has a gap, with those for aileron 1,\nwhich is sealed.\nBAJANCED AILERONS\n\nBalanced ailerons of the Frise and Handley Page\ntypes are widely used at $he present time, the particular\nforms of aerodynamic balance incorporated in these\nailerons giving improved yawing moments as well as\nreduced hinge moments. Good results are obtained\nwith proper designs but the exact shape of these ailerons\nhas a critical effect on the rolling and hinge moments,\nand each different installation is likely to require considerable individual development. Figure 8 shows\ntypical curves of rolling and hinge-moment coe5cients\nfor Frise type ailerons. The rolling-moment coe5cient\nfor the example shown increases less rapidly with deflection after an upward angle of 7 O to loo has been\nreached, which i considerably lower than the 20\'\ns\ncritical deflection for plain unbalanced ailerons (fig. 6).\nThus, it is uneconomical with respect to stick force to\nuse large up deflections and, owing to the smaller maximum deflections, larger ailerons are required for e%ciency than when ailerons of the plain unbalanced\nsealed type are used. The break in the curve of rollingmoment coe5cient against deflection is associated in\nthe case of the Frise and Handley Page types of aileron\nwith the downward projection of the nose of the aileron\nand the resultant breaking away of the flow from the\nunder side of the aileron. This effect can be reduced\nor possibly eliminated by using a raised-nose portion.\nThe Frise and Handley Page types of aileron have\ngaps between the aileron and the wing, and the effectiveness of the ailerons cannot be assumed equal to that of\nsmoothly sealed flaps.\nThe hingemoment curves as shown in figure 8 have\nvery low and even negative slopes at places, and extreme differential linkage cannot be used because overbalance would occur with medium or small deflectiom\nof the up aileron. Because the hinge-moment curves\nare far from straight, it is more di5cult to select suitable differential linkages for ailerons of this type than\nfor plain unbalanced ailerons. Satisfactory linkages\nhave often been obtained in practice, however, and there\nare many excellent examples in which a nice balance\nof conditions has been obtained with satisfactory control and light stick forces.\nAilerons 12 and 13 are examples of the Frise type\nA comparison of aileron 12 with the same size of plain\n\nmbalanced but sealed ailerons shows that the stick\n\'orces at the low-speed condition are about the same\n\'or both types of aileron, both with equal up-and-down\nmd with differential motion. At the high-speed conWon the Frise ailerons have somewhat lower stick\n\'orces than they have for the same control a t low speed.\n[t is worthy of note that, although the deflections are\nimall in both cams, the h e ailerons are apparently\nlot greatly oversized for, in their caw, substantially\ngreater deflections would be inefficient. The plain\nbilerons, on the other hand, have maximum deflections\nwell under the limiting 20\xc2\xb0 value and are decidedly\nnersized, considering the amount of control specified.\n\nAi/eron deflection. 6,\ndeg.\nFIQUBE\nS.-Typid rolling- and hingemomentcmlE&nt m e a for Frise ailerons.\n\nI a fked tab is used to trim the ailerons upward,\nf\nlower values of stick force can be obtained with the\nplain unbalanced ailerons (reference 11). The tab will\nnot give the same improvement with the Frise ailerons\nbecause of the varying slopes of the hinge-moment\ncurves.\nThe 0.40 cwby 0.30 b/2 Frise aileron 13 has a different\nsectional form than aileron 12 in that the nose portion\nis raised, and this aileron gives smoother curves of rolling and hinge-moment coefficients. The Frise aileron\nwith the raised nose shows no improvement in yawing\neffect over the plain unbalanced ailerons of the same\nsize, but the 0.25 cw by 0.40 b/2 Frise aileron, which has\nthe more typical Frise sharp nose, gives a slight improvement in this respect.\nThe drag of a l commonly used forms of Frise and\nl\nHandley Page ailerons is su5ciently great to be considered a serious disadvantage in connection with\n\n127\n\nREPORT NO. 605-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nmodern high-performance airplanes. For this reason,\nthe development of a type of aerodynamic balance that\ndoes not add to the drag is desirable.\nFLOATING-TIP AJLEBONS\n\nConventional ailerons operating on a lifting portion\nof the wing suffer several fundamental disadvantages.\nFirst, the production of rolling moment by a lifting\nwing gives rise to the adverse yawing moment; and,\nsecond, the loss of lift at the stall is accompanied by a\nloss of effectivenessof the ailerons. It has become apparent during the investigation, however, that the stall\nof the wing or, at any rate, of the outer portions of the\nwing, is accompanied by such a loss of stability that it is\nhardly an advantage to retain aileron rolling moments\nin this condition.\nIn the case of floating-tip ailerons, control is secured\nby surfaces that contribute no lift. This arrangement\navoids both the adverse yawing moment of ordinary\nailerons and the loss of rolling moment associated with\nstalling of the main wing; but it increases the drag of\nthe airplane and adds to the over-all dimensions. If\nthe airplane is designed to fulfill certain performance\nspecifications,such as landing speed, climb, ceiling, etc.,\nthe floating-tip ailerons cannot be considered an integral\npart of the main wing as they do not contribute effectively to the area or span so far as induced drag and\nlift are concerned.\nA number of floating-tip aileron devices were tested\nin the course of the investigatinn of reference 1. Apparently the most usable of these are the tip ailerons on\nthe 5:l tapered wing. Two methods of comparison\nhave been followed. In one case (aileron 14) the ailerons were included within the over-all dimensions of\nthe 5 l tapered-wing average airplane. The values\n:\ngiven in the table for this case (short wing) were based\ndirectly on the results of tests made in the 7-by 10-foot\n,\nwind tunnel (reference 1 part XI). The criterions\nshow the effect of reduced area and span of the lifting\nportion of the wing as a reduction of the climb and\nmaximum lift.\nIn order to take account of the effect of simply\nadding a tip aileron to a normal-size wing, further calculations were made. In this case (aileron 15) it was\nassumed that the over-all span of the average airplane\nwas increased by the additional span of the tip ailerons;\nhence, the aspect ratio of the lifting portion of the wing\nremained the same. The added span of the wing, although it contributed practically no lift and hardly\nmodified other stability characteristics of the airplane,\nconsiderably increased the damping in rolling. This\nfact was accounted for in the computations, data on\ndamping of the tested 5:l tapered wing with floatingtip ailerons included in the original plan form being\nextrapolated for this purpose. It would be natural to\nassume that the floating-tip ailerons would be just as\neffective as the main portion of the wing in contributing\n\n128\n\ndamping. The tests showed, however, that the damping of the 5:l tapered wing with floating tips was only\n\n85 percent of that with the tips rigid.\nThe rolling moments produced by floating-tip\nailerons can be predicted with good accuracy by the\nconventional aileron theory. The induced yawing\nmoments correspond to those given by plain ailerons\nwith an extreme uprigging or negative droop corresponding to the neutral floating positions of the tip\nailerons. Ordinarily, the tip ailerons, on account of\nthe local upwash at the end of the rigid wing, float a t a\nnegative angle of attack relative to the mean direction\nof ilight and hence give slight favorable induced yawing\nmoments with respect to the wind axes. The yawing\nand hinge momenh used in table I for the long-wing\nairplane (aileron 15) were predicted from the results\nof the wind-tunnel tests on the short 5:l tapered wing.\nThe tabulated results of the computations show that\nthe stick forces required for satisfactory control are\nreasonably low in the case of the short 5:1 tapered wing.\nIt will be noted that only relatively small deflections of\nthese ailerons are required for cbntrol, a fact that can\nbe attributed partly to the reduced damping in rolling\nshown by this wing. On the other hand with the long\nwing, when the tip ailerons were added to the regular\nwing span, the damping in rolling and moment of\ninertia were increased and, hence, larger stick forces\nwere required to produce the given bank. The same\nhinge-axis location, and hence the same degree of\nbalance of the ailerons, were assumed in both cases.\nIt will be noted that about the same force was required\nto produce 15O bank at high and low lift coefficients.\nAlthough the floating-tip ailerons give small favorable yawing moments, it will be noted that their use\nresdts in some inward sideslip during the 15\' bank.\nThe rolling motion of the wing induces a small adverse\nyawing effect as is indicated by the adverse sign of the\nyawing moment due to rolling. This cause combined\nwith the inward acceleration due to gravity is sufficient\nto bring about the inward sideslip in spite of the favorable yawing moment of the floating ailerons.\nIt has often been suggested that tip ailerons be\ntrimmed by tabs so as to float downward and give\nsome lift. Such an arrangement should improve the\nperformance characteristics but would void the advantage of these ailerons in giving favorable yawing\nf\nmoments. I the tip ailerons were trimmed so as to\nproduce as much lift as the adjacent rigid portion of\nthe wing, it is to be expected that they would show the\nsame proportion of adverse yawing moment to rolling\nmoment as do conventional ailerons.\nAt stalling angles of attack for the main wing the\nfloating tips remain unstded. Hence, they should be\nexpected to aid in preventing the loss of damping in\nrolling a t or near the stall. The only floating aileron\ndevice that effectivelyprevented the loss of damping in\nrolling i the wind-tunnel experiments was the long narn\n\nRfiSUMfi AND ANALYSIS OF N. A. C. A. LATERAL CONTROL RESEARCH\n\nrow aileron attached to a rectangular Wing. (See refer- made of the rotation of the airplane in roll immediately\nence 1,part XI.) In this particular case the performance following a movement of the stick and a specimen\ncharacteristics were so poor that the device as tested\ncould not be considered practical for application.\nAs noted in table I, the lateral-stability characteristics of the 5:1 tapered wing with the floating-tip\nailerons are almost as bad as those on the conventional\nrigid 5: 1 wing and are somewhat worse than those of\nthe rigid rectangular wing. Inasmuch as the damping\nin rolling is lost at an angle of attack 2\' below the\nangle for maximum lift, the airplane could not be safely\nmaintained in flight above this angle even though the\nailerons continue to give undiminished rolling moments.\nFlight tests of floating-tip ailerons on a tapered wing\nfitted to a Fairchild 22 airplane support this conclusion.\nWind-tunnel results with floating-tip ailerons showed\na smaller adverse effect on the performance characteristics of the 5: 1 tapered wing than on any of those\ntested. The effect of reducing the span and area of\ns\nthe rigid portion of a given wing i shown by the\ncomparison of the performance criterions of the short\n5: 1 tapered Wing, having an over-all aspect ratio of 6,\nwith those tabulated for the conventional rigid 5:1\ntapered wing, having the same over-all span and area.\nHere the maximum speed of the airplane will be hardly\naffected while the climb and maximum lift will be\nreduced, as indicated. Simply adding the tip portions\nt\nto the normal-size wing will increase the parasite drag\nAngle of otfock, a,deg.\na t high speed but, as shown by the tabulated criterions FIGWE9.-Comparison of rolling- and yawing-moment coefficients obtained with\nfor this case, will probably sIightly improve the climb.\nailerons and spoilers.\nSPOILERS\n\ntime history of the motion is shown in figure 10, toSpoilers in the form of small flaps or projections gether with similar information for other lateral conraised from the upper surface of the wing have presented attractive possibilities as lateral control devices\nbecause they give positive or favorable yawing moments\nand large rolling moments at the high angles of attack\nthrough the stall. (See fig. 9.) As spoilers giving\napparently satisfactory rolling and yawing moments\nhad been developed in the 7- by 10-foot wind-tunnel\ninvestigation (reference 1, part V), they were tested\nin flight on a Fairchild 22 airplane (reference 2). When\nthe spoilers were first tried i flight, the pilots noticed\nn\nthat the airplane apparently did not react until the\ncontrol stick had been given a medium amount of\ndeflection, after which the rolling velocity suddenly\nbuilt up to a much higher value than had been experienced with any previously tested control system.\nThis characteristic made it impossible to perform\nsmooth maneuvers requiring the coordination of the\nspoilers with the elevator or rudder and led to overcontrolling when an attempt was made to keep the\nwings level in gusty air. Closer inspection of the\nspoiler action, however, disclosed that for any spoiler\nmovement there was actually an appreciable delay\nbetween the movement of the spoiler itself and the start\nof the desired rotation in roll of the airplane. In trol devices including conventional ailerons. The\norder to substantiate the pilot\'s findings, records were records showed that the delay before rotation started\n\n129\n\nREPORT NO. 605-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nin the desired direction was of the order of half a second.\nThis lag seems surprisingly short to have much effect\non the control obtained with spoilers, but apparently\nit is suflicient to prohibit the use of the spoilers close\nto the ground because of the danger of overcontrolling.\nThe lag of spoilers was then studied by means of a\nspecial hinged wing model of 4-fOOt chord mounted\nin the 7- by 10-foot wind tunnel (reference 12). This\ninstallation reproduced the conditions encountered in\nthe flight tests. The tests with spoilers located in\ndifferent positions along the chord of the wing showed\nthat the lag was relatively large with the spoilers near\nthe leading edge and became less after the spoiler was\nmoved to the rear until it was zero for normal trailingedge flap-type ailerons.\nThe spoiler located near the rear of the wing was\nfound to act with a negligible amount of lag (less than\none-tenth second could not be detected by the pilots)\nand seemed to give some promise of making a satisfactory lateral control device. Flight tests were therefore made of a retractable spoiler located 83 percent\nof the wing chord back of the leading edge which,\nbecause of its rearward position, was referred to as a\n\xe2\x80\x9cretractable\xe2\x80\x9d aileron. The aileron was made in the\nform of a plate curved in a circular arc to form a segment of a cylinder and was moved in and out through\na slit in the upper surface of the wing and about an\naxis at the center o the cylinder. This arrangement\nf\nproduced no aerodynamic hinge moment and was\nfound to operate satisfactorily in flight on a Fairchild\n22 airplane (reference 3). The retractable aileron\nmounted on the assumed average airplane is number\n16 in fable I. The stick-force characteristic (zero\nforce) is not the most desirable but could be brought\nup to a desired value either by the addition of a spring\nin the aileron linkage or by an off-center location of\nthe hinge axis of the aileron. A large amount of control is available from ailerons of this type and the\nyawing characteristics are more satisfactory than those\nof conventional ailerons.\nCombinations of conventional ailerons with spoilers\nlocated ahead of them and deflected simultaneously\nshowed some promise in the wind-tunnel investigation\n(reference 1, part V) and were found to give satisfactory control free from lag when tested in flight on\nthe Fairchild 22 airplane (reference 2). With the\nspoiler deflected in front of the aileron, the floating\nangle of the aileron is raised and, if properly developed,\ncertain combinations seem very promising in regard t o\nboth yawing effect and stick force. Estimated characteristics of one such combination are given in table I,\naileron 17.\nAnother possible combination that has been tested\nand may deserve further development is one in which\ntwo spoilers are located in tandem and deflected simultaneously. The tests with this arrangement (reference\n12) showed that the lag of the combination was n\nc\n\n130\n\nFeater than that for the rear spoiler alone, whereas the\ninal rolling moment was the same as for the front one\nvhen used without a flap. Later tests indicate that\nipoilers located on the forward portion of the wing\nnay be rendered ineffective by the action of a split\nlap. One other point has not yet been completely\nietermined, namely, whether the rolling motion would\n;et under way with sufficient acceleration immediately\nhs\ntfter the start. T i point will be dealt with further in\n;he next section on slot-lip ailerons.\nSLOT-LIP AILEEONS\n\nMeans for the elimination of the lag of spoilers were\nnvestigated in the 7-by 10-foot tunnel and it was found\nthat the lag could be eliminated by providing a slot or\noassage through the wing back of the spoiler. This\nnvestigation has resulted in the development of what\nlave been termed the \xe2\x80\x9cslot-lip\xe2\x80\x9d ailerons (references 8\nmd 12). The slot-lip aileron is a combination of a\nspoiler-type flap located on the upper surface of the\nk g and a continuously opened slot, the flap forming\nthe upper portion or lip of the slot. The computed\nmntrol performances for two arrmgements of slot-lip\ntilemns in different positions along the chord of the\nwing are listed 18 and 19.h table I.\nThe slot-lip ailerons satisfactorily eliminate or reduce\nto a negligible value the actual lag intervening before\nthe wing starts moving in the desired direction, and\nthey give a very high maximum rate of rolling; but the\nrolling nevertheless increased less rapidly immediately\nafter the start of the motion than with conventional\ntrailing-edge flap-type ailerons. This condition is\nillustrated in figure 10, which includes curves from\nEight records of slot-lip ailerons on the Fairchild 22\nairplane and slot-lip ailerons on the W1-A airplane.\nIt will be noticed that with the W 1-A the rate of roll\nincreases nearly as rapidly as with conventional ailerons\nbut with the Fairchild 22 the action was considerably\nmore sluggish. The\xe2\x80\x99difTerencesin the behavior of these\ntwo airplanes have been studied (reference 8) and it\nhas been concluded that the superior response characteristics shown by the W1-A are due in large measure to\nthe relatively great dihedral (5O) and to the smaller\nmoments of inertia of this airplane. The secondary\nyawing action of the slot-lip ailerons is favorable, hence\nthe dihedral effect increases the rolling action. Other\ndifferences favorable to improved response of the\nW1-A are: (1) The more rearward location of the\naileron (0.30 cw compared with 0.20 cW tested on the\nFairchild 22) and (2) the slightly greater size of the\nslot.\nThe lateral control with the slot-lip ailerons on the\nW1-A seemed satisfactory to the pilots, but on the\nFairchild 22 it was found to be too sluggish and to give\nsomewhat the same feeling as a slight amount of lag.\nThis comparison, aided by several others of a pertinent\nnature, indicates that an additional point must be\n\nRl%TJMe AND ANALYSIS OF N. A. C. A. LATERAL CONTROL RESEARCH\n\ncovered in a specification for a completely satisfactory\nlateral control dealing with the acceleration or rate a t\nwhich the rolling increases during the h t half second\nor so following the actual start. It may be stated in\nsimple quantitative terms, applying to the conditions\nfor the assumed average airplane, that the angle of\nbank one-half second after a sudden deflection of the\ncontrols should be at least one-third the angle of bank\nreached at 1second. Thus, if a bank of 15\' i reached\ns\nin 1second, a t least 5 O of this should be attained in the\nfirst half second.2\nThe sluggishnesa of the slot-lip ailerons is a great\nhandicap in the method of comparison of control effectiveness used in the present report, in which a certain\nangle of bank must be obtained in a time of 1 second.\nEven though these ailerons give a high final rate of roll,\nexcessively great deflections are required to attain an\nangle of bank of 1 O in 1 second a t a lift coefficient of\n5\n1.8, and the stick forces are excessively high. This\nparticular disadvantage might be overcome by the use\nof a suitable aerodynamic balance but, even so, the\nsluggishness of the slot-lip ailerons might prevent them\nfrom being considered satisfactory if it were of the\nmagnitude found on the Fairchild 22 instead of that\nfound on the W1-A.\nThe sideslip accompanying a 15\' bank in 1 second is\nnegligible with the 0.55 c, slot-lip ailerons in the usual\nflight range with d a p p e d wings. With more forward\nlocations the yawing moment becomes decidedly positive, resulting in outward sideslip. Because of the\naction of the slots at high angles of attack, the damping\nin rolling is retained to an angle of attack beyond that\nfor maximum lift coefficient and, for this reason, it\nshould not be difficult to design an airplane incorporating these ailerons in such a manner that lateral control\nand stability would be reasonably satisfactory at all\nangles of attack that could be maintained in flight.\nThe continuously open slot, however, results in a high\ndrag, which reduces the high-speed and climbing performance to a noticeable extent. The drag is less for\nthe rear positions of the slot-lip ailerons and a special\ninvestigation has been made in the 7- by 10-foot tunnel\nto develop slots with reduced drags. Some success has\nbeen attained but, considering the best results to date,\nthese ailerons do not seem suitable for modern highperformance airplanes.\nLATERAL CONTROL WITH HIGH-LIFT FLAPS\n\nSince the inception of the research program of reference 1, Wing flaps have come into very general use and\nhave further complicated the problem of lateral control.\nIn steady flight ordinary ailerons give rolling moments\nthat vary almost inversely with the lift coefficient;\nhence, wings equipped with high-lift devices require\n:As mentioned previously, i order to simplify the computetions and to make\nn\npossible a comparkm with flight reoords,the starting time has been arbitrarily taken\n85 the h b U t at WhfCh the control SnriaeaS reached half their final d8fleetiOU.\n\nrelatively large control surfaces. The installation of\nan effective flap then becomes more difficult.\nAnother problem introduced by the use of high-lift\ndevices concern the adverse yawing moment of the\nailerons. The ratio of induced yawing to rolling\nmoment increases (adversely) in direct proportion to\nthe lift coefficient. Furthermore, the effect of a given\nyawing moment on the roulng control is usually greater\nwith flaps in use on account of the increased dihedral\neffect due to the flap. Thus it appears almost necessary to use some device that causes large changes of\nprofile drag resulting in a favorable component of yawing moment or to use wings with washout a t the tip\nportions (partial-span flaps) so that the induced yawing\nmoment is reduced. Many of the devices developed\nin reference 1 for use with full-span flaps show satisfactory yawing moments on account of the profile-drag\nincrements caused. Comparisons of a number of the\nmost promising devices have been made and are listed\nin section B of table I.\nPlain ailerons on wings with partial-span flaps.-On\naccount of the general use of partial-span split flaps\nwith ordinary ailerons, some tests of t@isarrangement\nwere made in the 7- by 10-foot wind tunnel (reference\n7). The tests were made with tapered wings because\nthey represent the most efficient application of the arrangement and are most used in practice. The most\ninteresting result of these tests was the small loss of\nmaximum l i f t coefficient entailed by the substitution of\nailerons for the tip portions of the flap, particularly in\nthe case of ailerons 21 and 23 as listed in table I, where\nonly 30 percent of the semispan was used for the aileron\nportion. The indicated reduction amounted to less\nthan 10 percent of the maximum lift shown by the same\ntapered wings with full-span split flaps. The reduction\nwas about the same for the two taper ratios tried. It\nwill be noted that the 5:l tapered wing gave more\nefficient control as regards stick forces under all conditions. In each case the stick force is slightly less for\nthe longer ailerons, although of course the wings with\nshorter ailerons showed better performance characteristics. Both sizes of ailerons on the 5:l tapered wings\nshowed a marked diminution of effectiveness above\nabout 10\' angle of attack, presumably due to flow\nseparation at the tip portions.\nThe deflection of the partial-span flap introduces a\nlarge relative washout of the aileron portions so that a t\na given over-all lift coefficient the ratio of yawing to\nrolling moments is less with flap down than with flap\nneutral. It w i l l be noted that the tabulated values of\nsideslip remain about the same at CL=1.8 as a t CL=l.O.\nThe sideslip at C,=l.O would have been appreciably\nless than indicated if a fhp-down condition had been\nassumed here.\nAlthough the lateral-stability characteristics of the\nhighly tapered wing are unfavorable, there are indica-\n\n131\n\nREPORT NO. 605-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\ntions that the use of a partial-span flap may not aggravate the instability in every case. The results of\nthe aileron tests, as well as visual observations of the\nflow by means of tufts, show that the effect of the upwash at the tips introduced by lowering the flap may\nbe compensated by a strong spanwise flow, which\ninhibits the stalling of these portions. The indications\nare that the angle of attack for autorotational instability\nwould be about the same with the flaps as without for\nthe Wings tested, although rolling experiments were not\ntried.\nPlain ailerons with retractable flap.-A plain aileron\nwith a split flap retracting ahead of it was developed as\na means of control with a full-span flap. This device\nhas been tested in %ght with a modified Fairchild 22\nairplane and is one of the few lateral control systems\nincorporating full-span flaps that has proved entirely\nsatisfactory in flight (reference 3). This device is so\ndesigned that the retracted flap does not interfere with\nthe ailerons in any way and hence the control characteristics with flap neutral are those of plain ailerons.\nWith the flap deflected, however, the characteristics are\nsimilar to those of the upper-surface ailerons tested in\nthe 7- by 10-foot Wind tunnel (reference 1, part XII).\nAlthough the deflected flap is in such a position as to\nshield the under surface of the ailerons entirely, it was\nobserved in the tests that the ailerons in this condition\nwere nearly as effective as conventional ailerons with\nunsealed gaps. The effectiveness of downward deflection, however, falls off rapidly at an angle of about 8\'.\nThe rolling-moment characteristics of the plain\nailerons with retractable flaps are such as to favor a\ndifferential motion, since the upgoing aileron is more\neffective than the downgoing one at high lift coefficients.\nThe hinge-moment characteristics are, however, distinctly unfavorable for this mode of operation inasmuch as the ailerons show a downward floating tendency with the flap down. Relatively large deflections\nof the ailerons are required to meet the control requirements at low speed on account of the shielding effect of\nthe flap, and consequently a relatively high gearing\nratio of ailerons to control stick is needed. The result\nis that the stick forces required for the specified banking\ncontrol are somewhat higher than those for conventional\nailerons throughout the flight range. These forces (see\naileron 24, table I) are well Within the desirable range\nfor the Fairchild 22 airplane, although they indicate\nundesirably high values for larger airplanes.\nThe yawing action of these ailerons is about the same\nas that of the conventional ailerons with partial-span\nflaps. Although the induced yawing moment ofthe\nailerons with the full-span flap is greater than that with\nthe partial-span flap, the ailerons cause larger compensating changes of profile drag.\nSeveral possible means of improving the control-force\ncharacteristics of these devices suggested themselves.\nThe device listed next in table I (aileron 25) shows the\ncalculated effects of such improvements. First, the\n\n132\n\nspan of the aileron was increased to what has previously\nbeen found the most efficient value and the chord of the\naileron was reduced as much as seemed practical.\nSecond, it was assumed that a trailing-edge tab (0.02\ncw bent down 15\') was attached to the aileron so as\nto avoid the downward-floating tendency. It was\nassumed that lowering the flap caused the same change\nin floating angle with the tab as without. Since the\ndeflection of the flap caused a large change in the\nfloating position of the aileron, it was desirable to\nchange the balancing characteristics of the differential\nwith flap deflection. Consequently, it was assumed\nthat the differential cranks were rotated into new\npositions as the flap was deflected. The resulting stick\nforces tabulated give an indication of the improvement\nthat might be effected by such development of the\ndevice.\nRetractable ailerons (spoilers).---Tests of spoilers\n(reference 12) showed that for locations behind about\n80 percent of the Wing chord the lag in rolling action\nwould probably be negligible. Flight tests were subsequently made of a Fairchild 22 airplane equipped with a\ncurved-plate spoiler that moved qdgewise into and out\nof the Wing through a narrow slit in the upper surface\nat 83 percent of the airfoil chord. This plate was\narranged to rotate about a hinge at the center of curvature, so that the air pressure (being normal to the plate)\ncaused no resultant hinge moment. The test airplane\nincorporated a full-span split flap and, inasmuch as the\ndownward motion of the spoiler took place entirely\nwithin the wing, the flap and spoiler did not interfere.\nThe flight tests showed very promising results, although the feature of zero hinge moment was not\nfound especially desirable. Angular-velocity and control-position records taken simultaneously in fIight\nshowed no definite lag or sluggishness in the response\nto control movements. (See reference 3.) The devices\nas tested (0.15 cw by 0.50 b / 2 ) were somewhat larger\nthan necessary to give the assumed satisfactory degree\nof control. As is indicated in the table, a maximum\ndeflection causing a 7.4 percent e, projection of the\nspoiler should be sufficient for control in the flap-down\ncondition.\nAn important advantage of the retractable ailerons\n(aside from their advantage in permitting the use of a\nfull-span flap) is that they give small favorable yawing\nmoments throughout the greater portion of the flight\nrange. At high lift coefficients with the flap in use,\nhowever, small adverse yawing moments result. (See\nreference 13.)\nAlthough the deflected spoiler causes quite an increase\nof profile drag, it is not expected that the incidental\ndeflections required for control in normal flight would\nappreciably affect the performance. The performance\ncriterions listed are, of course, for undeflected controls.\nExternal-airfoil flap-type ailerons.-The\nexternalairfoil (Junkers or Wragg) type flap has been studied\nas R possible means for improving the take-off and\n\nRfiSUMfi AND ANALYSIS OF N. A. C. A. LATERAL CONTROL RESEARCH\n\nceiling characteristics of airplanes in addition to providing the high-lift features of ordinary and split\nflaps. As this device showed promise of improved\nperformance, several methods of securing lateral control\nwith such a flap have been studied.\nA simple method of providing lateral control with\nfull-span external-airfoil flaps is to move the flaps\nthemselves independently as ailerons. (See refemnce\n10.) Thus the ailerons are used simultaneously as a\nhigh-lift device and to provide rolling moments without\nsacrificing a special part of the wing span. In order to\nemploy these flaps to their best advantage, it is necessary to deflect them downward over the entire wing\nspan, thereby avoiding excessive induced drag. The\naction of the flaps deflected downward as ailerons is\nsimilar to the action of ordinary ailerons with droop.\nThe external-airfoil flaps show a superiority over ordinary flaps for this pmpose, however, in that they\nretain their lift-changing effectiveness a t greater\n0)\ndownward deflections (in excess of 2\'.\nAileron 27 in the table is an arrangement of these\nflaps whereby the entire span is deflected downward\n2 and the semispan portions are moved differentially\n0\n\'\nfrom this downward position to provide rolling control.\nThis arrangement was tested in flight with the\nFairchild 22 airplane and was found to give unsatisfactory yawing characteristics, although the rolling\nmoments seemed to be ample. The computations\nmade for the average airplane indicated an adverse\nsideslip of loo accompanying a 1 5 O bank a t low speed\nwith the flaps down.\nA possible way of improving the adverse-yaw characteristics of these devices is to make use of the effect\nof washout. This method was used in the case of\naileron 28, where the flap was considered to extend\nunbroken over the middle portion of the wing with the\nparts of the flap used as ailerons covering the outer 50\npercent of the semispan portions. Wind-tunnel tests\n(reference 10) showed that, with the inner portion\ndown 30\' and the outer, or aileron, portions down only\nI the performance criterions were about the same\nO\n\'\n,\nas with the whole flap down 20\'. This change r e\nduced the yawing effect considerably, as shown by the\ntable, although the sideslip is still somewhat worse than\nis the case with most of the other devices.\nWhen the stick forces and deflections for these two\narrangements are compared, it will be noted that the\ndeflection required with the full semispan aileron is\nalmost as great as that required when only half the\nhs\nflap is used for control. T i fact is partly accounted\nfor by the difference in yawing effects.\nIn the low-speed conditions (CL=\n1.8) the ailerons\nare lowered 20\' in one case and 10\' in the other and\nthe effective floating angles are thereby increased by\nthese amounts. This fact introduces a difficulty into\nthe design of a suitable differential linkage. A linkage\ndesigned to accommodate the floating tendency with\n\nflaps neutral will overbalance when the flaps are\ndeflected. In the computations it was assumed that the\nadditional floating tendency was neutralized by a long\nspring that came into action as the flaps were lowered.\nThe external-airfoil, flaps permit high lift coefficients\nto be attained without excessive profile drag. The\nadvantage over a split flap begins to be apparent a t\nlift coefficients in excess of 0.7, aiding the take-off and\nthe low-speed climb but hardly affecting the maximum\nrate of climb. Hence, in this particular case, the performance criterions listed in table I do not fully indicate\nthe differences to be expected with these devices.\nAilerons with external-airfoil flaps.-A logical extension of the development of the slot-lip aileron has led\nto a device in which the aileron forms the lip of the\nslot between an ordinary external-airfoil-type flap and\nthe main Wing. (See aileron 29, table I.) This\narrangement avoids the excessive drag entailed by\nother forms of slot and, on account of the rearward\nposition of the aileron, should give good response\ncharacteristics (except, possibly, under certain conditions noted later).\nThe device as tested (see reference 6) comprised an\naileron 0.12 cm wide and b/2 long. The tests showed\nthat, in general, the effectiveness of the aileron was\nreduced by the presence of the flap, in accordance with\nthe theoretical consideration that any change i slope\nn\nof the wing section ahead of the trailing edge is less\neffective than a corresponding change a t the trailing\nedge itself. When the flap is lowered, however, an\nupward deflection of the aileron apparently causes\nseparation of flow over the flap, thus greatly reducing the\nlift and developing a large rolling moment. With\nthe flap down 30\' this change occurs at the beginning\nof the aileron deflection, while a t intermediate flap\ndeflections the change occurs a t greater up aileron\nangles. This more or less sudden change of conditions,\nin addition to giving a large increase of rolling moment,\nalso caused a reduction or a reversal of hinge moment;\nhence, the device may be impracticable for use a t\nintermediate flap settings. (See reference 9.)\nIn the device as shown in table I the downward deflection of the aileron is limited by the presence of the flap\nnose to a maximum of about 7 and it is consequently\n\'\n,\nnecessary to use a dzerential movement. Change of\nsetting of the flap has a pronounced effect on the\nfloating angle of the aileron. With the flap set at 30\'\na differential giving no more than 7 O downward deflection of the aileron will be overbalanced by this floating\ntendency. In the computation it was assumed that a\nspring tending to turn each aileron downward (with a\ntorque of 8.7 foot-pounds acting a t the aileron hinge)\nwas brought into action by lowering the flap. With\nthe flap neutral the floating angle of the aileron is too\nsmall for satisfactory balance, although wind-tunnel\ntests showed that it could be effectively increased by a\ntab. Consequently, the device was assumed to incor-\n\n133\n\nREPORT NO. 605-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nFigure 11 summarizes the results of a number of\nwind-tunnel experiments with plain flaps (references\n14, 15, and 16) and shows the measure of flap effectiveness (Aa/AS) as a function of the relative flap\nchord. A curve predicted by wing-section theory\n(reference 17) is also shown for comparison. The surprisingly powerful effect of a narrow flap should be\nnoted. Thus, deflecting a 0.20 c,,, flap is about half as\neffective as deflecting the entire wing section.\nSince the effective angle of attack of a wing section\nis a linear function of the camber (reference 17), the\ncurve of figure 11 may be used to predict the effect of a\nmultiply hinged flap, such as an aileron equipped With\na balancing tab. The combined effect of a succession\nof bends along the wing section may be found by\ncalculating the separate effects of each bend and\nadding them. Thus the effect of a 0.20 e, aileron equipped\n11. ANALYSIS OF CONVENTIONAL FLAP-TYPE with a 0.05 c,,, tab is (using values from Sg. 11)\nAILERONS\n\nporate such a tab (0.018 c,,,, down 5\') and the spring\ntension was adjusted to accommodate the effect of the\ntab with flap down.\nThe resulting stick forces, together with the deflections required for control, appear in the table. It will\nbe noted that the greatest deflection required is that at\nC,= 1.0. In this condition the aileron does not produce\nthe previously discussed change in flow over the flap.\nAt CL=1.8 the deflection required is small because a\nsmall upward movement of the aileron in the flap-down\ncondition produces a large rollingmoment. The yawing\neffect is adverse but is not excessive.\nThe performance characteristics of this Wing (with\nthe N. A. C. A. 23012 airfoil flap) are somewhat better\nthan those of the two wings previously considered,\nwhich had flaps of Clark Y section.\n\nThe practical advantages of plain ailerons are well\nknown, and, since they are universally used in more or\nless modified form, the following section is devoted to\nan analysis of factors involved in their design.\nOne of the conclusions of the lateral control investigation has been that no decisive benefit was to be\ngained from a device that continued to give rolling\nmoments when the major outer portions of the wings\nwere stalled. I stalling of the aileron portions of the\nf\nwing is prohibited, plain ailerons or other devices\nlocated near the trailing edge of the wing will retain\ntheir effectiveness.\nI f the loss of rolling effect on a stalled wing is discounted, it appears that the primary disadvantage to\nbe associated with plain ailerons is their adverse yawing\neffect. For this reason the yawing action of plain\nailerons will be rather fully analyzed.\n\nAc~=0.516,+0.216z\n\n(2)\n\nwhere 6, is the deflection of the aileron with respect to\nthe wing and 6 t is the deflection of the tab with respect\nto the aileron.

Ailerons covering\nonly a portion of the span influence the lift at every\nspanwise point and this effect appears to be satisfactorily predicted by the airfoil theory. Calculations of\nthe effects of ailerons based on this theory have been\nmade, the most extensive series being reported in\nreference 18.

In order to use these charts it is\nnecessaxy to ascertain from figure 1+ the section\ncharacteristic AalAS, which is a function of the relative\nchord of the aileron. The charts may be used for\ndifferential ailerons merely by taking the difference of\nangle of attack of the right and left aileron portions.\nThe theoretical rolling moment is independent of any\ninitial washout of the wing sections along the span;\nhence, the rolling-moment curves are applicable to\nwings with partial-span flaps. The charts cannot be\nused with devices that change the slope of the lift\ncurve nor for excessive deflections that introduce disturbed air flow. In this connection it appears that a\ndeflection of plain ailerons involving disruption of the\nair flow is inefficient from considerations of stick force.\nIt will be noted that two sets of curves are given for\ntapered wings. The solid lines apply to ailerons that\nare not tapered with the wing, i. e., ailerons of constant\nactual chord. For this type the change of equivalent\nangle of attack should be calculated on the basis of the\nwing-tip chord (whether or not the aileron extends to\nthe wing tip). The long-dash curves are for the particular case in which the aileron chord is a constant\nproportion of the wing chord along the span, in which\ncase the change of equivalent angle of attack does not\nvary along the aileron portion. The additive effect of\nan element of aileron covering any spanwise portion of\nthe wing may be determined from the increment of the\nc,/Aa curve over that portion. Although the curves of\nfigure 13 show increasing rolling-moment coefficients\nwith increased aspect ratios of the wings, the control\nrequirement (rolling-moment coefficient for a given\nbanking effect) also increases with aspect ratio and, on\naccount of the damping, in nearly the same way as\ndoes the coefficient. (See reference 4.) In general, it\nmay be said that the relative proportions of the ailerons\n\n135\n\nshould not be reduced on account of increased aspect\nratio.\nYAWING MOMENT\n\ninitial lift and a rolling moment give rise to an induced\nyawing moment.\nA more specific treatment of this theory is given in\nreference 18. The formula for yawing moment that\nup-and-dom deflections is\nresuits for equd\nC,,= KCL X Ci\n(5)\nwhere K is a factor dependent on the aspect ratio and\nthe plan form of the wing, and to some extent, on the\nspanwise position of the aileron. It is interesting to\nnote that with a given equal up-and-down aileron\ndeflection the induced yawing moment is the same\nthroughout the speed range, while the rolling moments\nand the stabilizing factors are greatly reduced at the\nlower speeds.\nFigure 12 gives a comparison of theoretical and\n\nYawing moment with equal up-and-down deflection.-The results of experiments indicate that the\nprimary source of adverse yawing moment given by\nplain ailerons at small deflections is the theoretical, or\ninduced, yawing moment. The production of rolling\nmoment results in an induced twisting flow analogous\nto the downwash in direct lift. The yawing moment\narises from the resultant inclination of the supporting\nf\nlift vectors along the span.

Unlike the rolling moment, however, the yawing moment of differential ailerons is not the same as that of ailerons with\nequal deflections. I n the general charts given in figure\n13 the ratio of yawing to rolling moments a t CL=1.0 is\ngiven rather than Cn/Aa. In this case the differences\nbetween two points cannot be used directly to give the\nyawing moment of an aileron extending between these\ntwo points. The yawing moment caused by an aileron\nending inboard of the tip may be found, however, by\ntaking the difference of the yawing moments given by\ntwo aileroas, one extending from the inboard end of\nthe actual aileron to the wing tip and the other extending from the outboard end to the tip. The straight\nand tapered ailerons should give yawing moments in\npractically the same ratio to the rolling moment;\n\nThe effect of the yawing moment of coefficient -0.0072\nis calculated in the same way, i. e.,\n~=\n2\n\n-O0.72XO.65= -0.47 foot\n\n(11)\n\nThe effect of these rolling and yawing moments applied\nsimultaneously is\n@=4.7-0.47=4.23\n2\n\nfeet\n\n(12)\n\nThus, deflecting the ailerons suddenly to f7.4O causes\na 4.23-foot displacement of the wing tips in 1 second.\nThe angle of bank for the average airplane (b/2 = 16\nfeet) is\nhb\n2\n\n41~7;\nX57.3= 15O\n\n2\n\n(13)\n\nas appears in the table.\nYawing moment with differential deflection or\n\ndroop.-The effect of an unequal movement of the\nailerons may be taken into account by considering an\nequivalent equal up-and-down deflectiqn from a mean\nupward position of the ailerons.

A. 6.A. LATERAL CONTROL RESEARCH\n\nStrictly speaking, the hinge moment of a deflected\nflap should be calculated in two parts. The primary\npart arises from that component of the distributed\npressure change which does not contribute to the lift of\nthe airfoil section. Since no lift is involved, this component is independent of the aspect ratio. The second\ncomponent of the hinge moment, proportional to the\nlift change, is subject to the ordinary aspect-ratio correction. The correction is, however, small except for\nwide flaps.\nSome additional considerations arise in the application of aileron hinge moments to the calculation of\ncontrol force. The angular travel and the length of the\ncontrol stick (or radius of the control wheel) are limited\nin practice. Thus, ailerons requiring large deflections\nmust be geared to the control stick or wheel in a high\nratio. In the case of the average airplane the total circumferential movement of the end of the control stick\nwas assumed to be 0.73 foot in the case of each of the\ncontrol devices. This value corresponds to a -+25O\ndeflection of a 20.inch stick corresponding to that available in the FaircJdd 22 airplane.\nI reference is made to the tabulated results for\nf\naileron 1, it is seen that the total deflection necessary to\ninsure the assumed satisfactory degree of control\n22.5O at C,=l.O, in this case) is ~ t 1 1 . 2 ~ .\nThe work\nof deflecting ailerons of chord c, and span ba is\n\nipward pressure of the upgoing aileron is partly com)ensated by its increased mechanical advantage and\n,hat the increased upward pressure on the downgoing\nderon is also partly compensated by its reduced\nnechanical advantage.

The reduction of operating\nforce is accomplished by taking advantage of the upfloating tendency of the ailerons. With differential\nlinkage the ailerons on opposite tips of the Wing begin to\nmove at different rates immediately after they are\ndeflected from neutral, the downgoing aileron moving\nmore slowly than the upgoing one. The upgoing aileron\nthus has the greater mechanical advantage at the control-stick connection. It is evident that the reduced\n\nwhere 0 is the \xe2\x80\x9cgular deflection of the control stick.\nIn any given case the stick force can be balanced out\nat only one angle of attack and, in general, the balancing\neffect diminishes as the angle of attack is reduced.\nHence, if the stick force is made to become zero a t an\nangle of attack above maximum lift, overbalance of\nthe control in normal flight will be avoided.\nA more or less complicated mechanical linkage that\nwould give aileron movements approximating equation\n(19) could be devised. The ordinary simple linkage\nconsisting of two properly set cranks connected by a rod\ncan, however, be arranged to give the desired motion\nWith close approximation, and such an arrangement will\nbe given primary consideration.\n\n139\n\nREPORT NO. 605-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nSuch a simple linkage can be made to satisfy two conditions\'for a minimum stick force. Figure 16 shows a\ntype of stick-force curve that satisfies two very simple\ncriterions. First, the slope of the curve is zero at the\nbeginning of the deflection and, second, the resultant\nstick force is zero at a stick deflection corresponding to\nthe floating angle of the up aileron. As was stated\nearlier, the latter condition is satisfied by arranging for\nthe downgoing aileron to reach dead center when the\nupgoing aileron reaches the floating angle. Figure 17\nshows geometrical arrangements of linkages that satisfy\nthese two criterions for a minimum stick force. I the\nf\nspacing of the crank centers is known in terms of the\ncrank radius, the figure gives directly the neutral settings of the two cranks. The differential thus chosen\nwill give what amounts to complete balance a t the\nspecified floating angle. The maximum downward\n\nputed from floating moments that were found by integration of pressure-distribution diagrams for a smooth\nWing (reference 20) and hence correspond to smoothly\nsealed flaps.\nFor the comparisons given in table I, idkite linkages\n(R=O in fig. 17) were assumed to simplify the computations of control force. In most cases of differential\nailerons listed, several trial computations of stick force\nwere made to ascertain the optimum differential arrangement. These trial computations included the\n\nFIGURE\nlS.-Type of curve that satisEes simple criterions for minimum stick force.\n\ntravel of the aileron is shown in each case and it is to\nbe noted that, if the maximum deflection of the upgoing\naileron exceeds the assumed floating angle, the downgoing aileron will pass dead center and return toward\nneutral.\nSince the floating tendency of a given aileron has a\nprimary influence on the design of the differential\nlinkage, it will be necessary to devote some study to\nthis aileron characteristic. It appears that the floating\nangle of a plain flap-type aileron can be attributed to\ntwo effects: (1) a hinge moment proportional to the\nangle of attack of the wing, this moment being greater\nfor large flap chords but independent of the shape of\nthe Wing section; and (2) a hinge moment attributed to\nthe camber of the wing section, which remains constant\nas the angle of attack is changed. This second moment\nis primarily S u e n c e d by the camber of the aileron portion itself and is greatly affected by small changes at\nthe extreme trailing edge. Thus, a small &xed tab can\nbe used to introduce a large constant floating moment.\nFigure 18 shows the variation of floating angle with\ntla.p chord and lift coefficient for the Clark Y wing section.

On the assumption that it is permissible to allow the control force to\nbecome zero a t CL=1.25 (6,,=1l0), the differential\nchosen by means of the chart will have neutral settings\nof 0,=15O and 6,=30\xc2\xb0, approximately.

It is on this account that the balancing\neffect of the differential diminishes. The stick forces\ntabulated for the differentially linked aileron 1 show\nthis effect as an increase of stick force at high speed.\nIt is possible to introduce a large constant floating moment by means of a properly formed fixed tab. The\nl\neffect of such a tab is to increase the floating angle at a l\nflight speeds by a constant amount so that the per-\n\nAs was stated before, the tab produces an essentially\nconstant change in floating angle. The variation of\nBoating angle with angle of attack can be found from\nfigure 18. Figure 19 gives the change of aileron floating\nangle with tab deflection. (See references 9 and 21.)\nThe experiments indicated that this ratio depended\nprimarily on the ratio of tab chord to aileron chord independently of the chord of the aileron, although this\nrelation can not be expected to apply as the aileron\nchord is indefinitely increased. At the Reynolds Number of the tests the tabs began to lose effectiveness when\n\nL i f f coefficient, C,\nFIGURE\n18.-Floating angles of sealed llasps of various chords on a Clark Y w n\nig\ncomputed from pressure-distributiondata (reference 20).\n\nBS\n\ncentage variation with flight speed is reduced. This\neffect is especially pronounced in the case of very narrow\nailerons, which do not show a very great variation of\nfloating angle with angle of attack.\nFurthermore, the maximum floating angle shown by\nvery narrow ailerons is not great enough to permit the\nuse of a differential to the best advantage. Thus, if\nthe floating angle is considerably smaller than the\nmaximum upward deflection required to produce sufficient control, the stick force may rise considerably after\nthis point is reached on account of the return of the\ndowngoing aileron and the consequent extra deflection\nrequired of the upgoing aileron. Advantageous use of\na differential in such cases can be accomplished by incorporating a fixed tab (or a small amount of camber)\narranged to trim both ailerons upward. In order to\nsecure satisfactory results with a tab, a reasonably\nsmooth inset type with a sealed juncture should be used.\nAttached tabs or tabs set at large angles (6,>&15\')\nhave been found to cause an adverse increase in the\nslope of the hinge-moment curve.\nFigure 19 shows the summarized results of experiments with tabs made in the 7- by 10-foot wind tunnel.\n\ndeflected past 15\'; hence, the ratios given should be\nconsidered applicable to tab deflections not exceeding\nthis angle. Figure 19 may also be used to estimate the\nbalancing effect of a movable tab.\nIt appears from figure 19 that a very large floating\nangle can be obtained by the use of a relatively small\ninset tab and deflection. Thus, the floating angle can\nvery easily be altered to suit a given set of conditions.\nIt has been pointed out that it is desirable to have the\nfloating angle at least as large as the maximum upward\ndeflection required for control so that the stick-force\ncurve will lie reasonably near the minimum throughout\nthe range. The smaller the percentage variation of\nfloating angle with angle of attack, the smaller will be\nthe variation of the actual stick force with fhght speed.\nIt would therefore appear desirable to trim the ailerons\nup as far as possible by means of a tab.

This tab on the\naverage airplane would be only 1.6 inches wide and the\ndeflection of 10\' would displace the trailing edge of the\nwing section by only one-third inch and would consequently not be expected to make 8 noticeable change in\nthe drag or the pitching moment of the Wing as a whole.\nThe differential linkage giving complete balance at a=\n15\' with tbis floating angle can be found from *\ne\n17.\nThe neutral settings of the cranks are\n\nThe maximum downward deflection found on the chart\nis about 8 O , but in this case the aileron is not required\nto reach this deflection (20\xc2\xb0 up and 8\' down) to produce\na s a c i e n t bank. Reference to figure 18 shows that\nthe reduction in floating angle between cL=1.25\n(maximum) and CL=l.O is 2.5\'50 that, with the tab\nassumed, the floating angle at a=lOo (CL=l.O) will be\n20\xc2\xb0-2.5\'=\n\n17.5\'\n\nSimilarly, the new floating angle at a=O\'\nwillbe\n20\xc2\xb0-4.80=15.20\n\n(22)\n(c~\'0.35)\n(23)\n\nThese values indicate that the balancing effect of the\ndifferential will not be greatly reduced at the higher\nspeeds. Table I gives the actual stick forces as computed at these lift coefficients and indicates the reduction possible with a tab. An even better degree and\nrange of balance could be attained with narrower\nailerons on account of the smaller variation of floating\nangle with angle of attack.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe provision of control rolfing moments at high\nangles of attack or beyond the stall is not s d c i e n t to\nsecure control in flight at these angles unless the damping in rolling is retained. This requirement necessitates\nthat at least the tip portions of the wing remain unstalled; hence, it cannot be considered a decided advantage to retain control rolling moments far above the\nstall with conventional wings.\nThe flight-testing experience gained throughout the\ncourse of the lateral control investigation has led to\nmore or less definitely quantitative ideas regarding the\ndesired effectiveness of the lateral control and the\ndesirable variation of the control forces in normal ftight.\n\n142\n\nFrom considerations of operating force required for a\ngiven amount of control, plain naxrow sealed ailerons\nwith deflections limited to 20\' seem about the most\nefficient. Very great taper, or change of aileron chord\nalong the span, leads to inefficiency whether used with a\nstraight or a tapered wbg. A differential linkage can\nbe so designed as to reduce considerably the operating\nforce of ordinary unbalanced ailerons, especially if a\nsmall fixed tab is used to increase the floating angle.\nSeveral devices, notably the plain ailerons with flap\nretracting ahead, and the retractable aileron or spoiler\nlocated at 0.80 cw have been developed and proved in\nflight to be suitable for use with fd-span flaps. It was\nfound, however, that the maximum lift of a tapered\nwing with split flaps was reduced less than 10 percent\nby the removal of the outer 0.30 b[2 portions of the flap,\nso that a conventional aileron could be used over that\nportion of the wing without great loss.\nAerodynamic theory can be successfdy applied to\nthe calculation of rolling and yawing moments of plain\nailerons provided that experimental section characteristics are used in the computation of the local changes i\nn\nangle of attack along the wing span caused by the\nailerons. Further calculations involving the airplane\nstability characteristics can be applied to the prediction of the actual resultant motions caused by a given\ndeflection of the control, thus giving a measure of efrectiveness in controlling the movements of the airplane.\n\nLANGLEY\nMEMORIAL\nAERONAUTICAL\nLABORATORY\n,\nNATIONAL\nADVISORY\nCOMMITTEE AERONAUTICS,\nFOR\nLANGLEY\nFIELD,VA., April, 80,1937.\nREFERENCES\n1.

PEARSON ROBERT. JONES\nand\nT\n\nSUMMARY\n\nfiYability derivaibes have been computed f o r twisted\nwings o different plan forms that include variations in\nf\nboth the wing taper and the aspect ratio. Taper ratios\no 1.0, 0.50, and 0.25 are considered for each o three\nf\nf\naspect ratios: 6, 10, and 16. The specijic derivatives jor\nwhich results are given are the rolling-moment and the\ny a w i n g - m o w derivatives with respect to (a) rolling\nvelocity, (b) yarn-ng velocity, and (e) angle o sideslip.\nf\nThese results are given in such a f o r m that the e$ect o\nf\nany initial symmetrical wing twist (stich as may be\nproduced by Jlaps) on the derivatives may easily be taken\ninto account.\nIn addition to the stability derivatives, results are\nincluded for determining the theoretical rolling moment\ndue to aileron deJEection and a series o injluence lines i\nf\ns\ngiven by which the loading across the span may be determined for any angle-of-attack distribution that may\nOCCUT on the wing plan forms considered.\nThe report also\nincludes incidental TefeTences to the application of the\nresults.\n\nThis report gives theoretical stability derivatives for\na variety of wing shapes including nine m e r e n t plan\nforms and covering, in most cases, an arbitrary distribution of twist.\nPast work on the stability characteristics of wings has,\nexcept in isolated cases, been confined to andysis by the\n\xe2\x80\x9cstrip method,\xe2\x80\x9d wherein the effects of aerodynamic induction were neglected.

The procedure followed\nhere is to calculate the spanwise lift and drag distributions for the fictitious twist (i. e., that replacing the\neffect of motion) in the ordinary way, but to incline the\n\nTHEORETICAL STABILITY AND CONTROL CHARACTERISTICS OF WINGS\n\n151\n\nREPORT NO. 635-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nlift and drag components so as to maintain them along\nthe perpendicular and the parallel to the actual local\nrelative-wind velocity. A further refinement of the\ntheory would involve the influence of the curvature of\nthe wing wake. Since the helix angles bvdlved in the\nmotions are small (pb/2V<0.1 and p.b/2V<O.1) and\nsince that region of the wake nearest the wing is of\npredominant infiuence, this correction may be neglected.\nInasmuch as the various stability derivatives thus\ndepend upon a summation of appropriate components\nof the lift and the drag loading along the span, it was\nnecessary to determine these distributions for each of\ntho wings with several different angle-of-attack distributions. For this purpose the Lot2 method of calculation (references 1 and 2) was used. In order to keep\nthe computations from becoming too lengthy, the chorddistribution function that occurs in this method was\nexpressed by, at most, three terms of a cosine series (as\nin table I). Although this expression caused the chord\ndistributions of the actual wings (fig. 1)to differ slightly\nfrom those for linearly tapered wings with rounded sips,\nsuch a procedure was justified because these slight departures in plan form had only a small effect on the\ncharacteristics but permitted a large saving in the computations required. Thus only the terms near the\ndiagonal running through equations (19) of reference 2\nentered into the computations. As the various derivatives for the elliptical wing could be obtained relatively\neasily, they were sometimes computed in order to determine the shape of the various derivative curves; it was\ntherefore possible to use fewer points in fairing similar\ncurves for the tapered wings.\nThe wing theory was applied in a special way so as\nto obtain results applicable to any arbitrary twist of\nthe wings. The theoretical span loading being a linear\nfunction of the angle-of-attack distribution, the loading\ndue to arbitrary twist can be built up, as will be indicated later, from certain elementary loadings by superposition. The elementary loadings considered were\nthose caused by simple unit jumps of angle of attack\noccurring at different points of the span.\nFor each of the nine tapered wings, the first 20\nFourier coefficients determining the load distributions\nwere computed (10 odd and 10 even) for the cases of\nunit angles of attack extending inward from the wing\ntip and covering various amounts of the semispan.\nThe rest of the wing was in each case assumed to be at\nzero angle of attack. The portions thus covered were\n0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 of the semispan.\nIn spite of the great number of harmonic terms retained, the conditions near the points of discontinuity\ni the angle of attack required special treatment. The\nn\nproblem of these end conditions has been solved by\nBet2 and Petersohn (reference 3) and their results were\nn\nutilized i fairing the load curves through this region.\nFigure 2 shows the elementary loadings that were calculated, including the modified fairing. The results\npertain specifically to the chord distributions illustrated\n\n152\n\nin figure 1 but interpolation might be made for intermediate plan forms.\nIt is evident that any angle-of-attack distribution,\nsymmetrical or unsymmetrical, may be built up of\nelemental steps of the type used in deriving figure 2.\nFigure 3 illustrates the procedure of hding the resultant\nload distribution. Thus, the loading contributed by\nelement 10 of figure 3 (a) is obtained by deducting the\nload curve due to an increment of angle of attack extending between 6 and C from that duo to an increment\nextending between A and C. Although this process\ncould be continued until the load distribution was completely determined, the same results can be more easily\nobtained from influence lines, which give the load at a\nparticular spanwise station due to the effect of unit\nangle-of-attack changes extending inward various\n\n(a) Angledf-attackdistribution.\n(b) Load distribution for elemant (O.\nI)\nFIGURE\nI.--LOad components for an element.\n\namounts from the right wing tip.

In the subsequent charts, it is sometimes\nnecessary to stipulate either that the initial angle-ofattack distribution be symmetrical about the Wing\ncenter line or that the dihedral angle be constant along\nthe span.

In unstalled flight, when the Wing rolls\nabout the longitudinal wind axis, a damping or restorhg\nmoment is set up. This moment L,ollinp\nvaries directly\nwith the angular velocity p and is defined by the\nequation\n(5)\n2~\nwhere the proiuct Cz,Pb is simply a rolling-moment\n\ncoefficient that varies linearly with the angular velocity.\n\nTHEORETICAL STABILITY AND CONTROL CHARACTERISTICS OF WINGS\n\nThe computed variation of the derivative C,, with\naspect ratio and taper i given in figure 8. In the usual\ns\nlift range below the stall, this derivative may be considered to be independent of either initial wing twist or\nangle of attack and of the wing dihedral. In conventional cases, practically the entire damping moment for\nthe airplane may be attributed to the wings. It can be\nseen that the moment contributed by a tail surface,\ngeometrically similar to the wing but with only one-\n\nIonents being the more important. With the specified\nystem of axes, positive rolling produces a negative\nrawing moment or, for any case, with positive lift coeficients the falling Wing tends to advance owing to the\nwedominating influence of the lift vectors.\nThe yawkg moment due to rolling, unlike the rolling\nnoment due to rolling, depends upon both the initial\nring twist and the angle of attack. For untwisted\nRings, however, the yawing moment is zero a t zero lift\nmd increases linearly with the wing lift coefficient.\nn\n?or a twisted wing, the yawing moment due to rolling,\ntlthough varying linearly with the over-all lift coeffitient, is not necessarily zero when CL is zero but may\nlave either a small positive or a small negative value\nlepending upon the initial angle-of-attack distribution.\n)wing to this circumstance, it is most convenient to\n:xpress the derivative Cnpas a ratio in terms of unit\nIartial-span angle-of-attack changes.\nFigure 9 shows the computed variation of the ratio\nYnp/a unit symmetrical angle-of-attack changes that\nfor\n?xtend out from the wing center so as to cover various\ntmounts of the Wing span. Thus, if it is desired to\nletermine Cnpfor an untwisted rectangular Wing of\ntspect ratio 6 a t an angle of attack of 0.1 radian, the\nd u e 0.195 (for an angle of attack of 1 radian), read\n\'rom the solid line of figure 9 (a) a t the relative dis,ance of 1.0, is multiplied by 0.1 to give a value of\n7,\n, equal to 0.0195. If, now, a half-span flap of conitant chord ratio were displaced an amount sufficient\n,o cause an additional change in angle equal to 0.1\n-adian over the portion with flaps, the new value of\nPnpwould be\n(0.1 X0.195)+ (0.1X0.134)=0.0329\n\nThis value of C, is then inserted into the equation\nAspect rofi0.A\n\nFIGURE\n8.-Rolling derivative aue to rolling.

Comparison of the present values of C,, with similarly derived values given in\nreference 4 indicates that the effect of rounding the\nwing tips is to reduce the theoretical restoring moment\nby about 6 percent for wings of aspect ratio 6.\nYAWING MOMENT DUE TO ROLLING\n\nDuring a rolling motion, the wing experiences a linear\nantisymmetrical change in angle of attack along the\nspan and, as a result, antisymmetrical loadings are\nadded to those that originally were on the wing. The\nresulting yawing moment is due to components of thc\nlift as well as to the drag along the span, the lift com-\n\nto determine the yawing moment due to a rolling\nangulm velocity.\nAlthough the curves given in figure 9 can be directly\nof\nused to determine the effect on Cnp deflecting partialspan flaps of constant fiap-chord ratio, they are also\nreadily adapted to the determination of C, for a wing\nwith ang initial twist provided that the twist distribution is symmetrical about the wing center line. The\nprocess is illustrated in the fol!owing example where it\nis desired to find the value of Cnpfor a rounded-tip\nrectangular Wing of aspect ratio 6 with the symmetrical\nangle-of-attack distribution shown in figure 10 (a).\nThe contribution of the element of angle of attack dcu,\nshown at the point a=0.15 radian, to the total value\nof the wing Cnpis equivalent to that caused by a fullspan elemental flap minus the contribution of the\ncross-hatched portions.

Changes in taper ratio did, however, have an\nappreciable effect on the value of C , (fig. 8) with the\nresult that the ratio of the yawing to the rolling moment\nin roll will, in general, increase with increase in taper.\nInasmuch as the inclination of the lift vectors at the\nouter portions of the span has such a predominating\neffect on the yawing moment, the most effective means\nof reducing C- for a given wing lift coefficient i s to\ngive the wings washout toward the tips.\nThe yawing moment due to rolling is, in conventional\ndesigns, largely due to the wings.

For simplicity, the\nwing i s assumed to have no initial twist and the dihedral\nangles are assumed constant over each of the portions\nA, 6, and C. For small angles of sideslip 8, the increase in angle at tip A is, to a h t approximation,\nequal to r&;whereas, at the opposite tip A\', there is\nan equal decrease of the angle of attack. The portions\n6-43\',\nhaving no dihedral, contribute no change in angle\nof attack when the wing is sideslipping. At the center,\n\n161\n\nREPORT NO. 635-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nhowever, owing to the negative angle of dihedral rc,\nthere is an effective decrease in angle of attack over\npast C equal to r,p and on C\' there is a similar increase\nin angle. Figure 15 shows the resulting effective\nangle-of-attack distribution for the particular shape of\ndihedral assumed.\nThe effect of this distribution is similar to that caused\nby two pairs of ailerons equally and oppositely deflected\nwith the inner pair opposing the rolling action of\nthose at the tip. Positive areas of dihedral on the\nadvancing wing tend to add load onto that wing. For\nthe system of axes chosen, all areas with positive\ndihedral produce a negative rolling moment with a\npositive angle of sideslip. T i moment, like the rolling\nhs\nmoment due to roll, is independent of the initial wing\ntwist as long as no portion of the wing becomes stalled.\nThe rolling-moment derivative due to sideslip CJB\nmay be determined from figure 16, which gives the\nvariation of C,p for various unit antisymmetrical\nangle-of-attack distributions (i. e., symmetrical portions\nwith constant dihedral) that extend out from the wing\ncenter and cover various relative amounts of the wing\nsemispan. I n the usual case, where the dihedral\nangle r is constant along each semispan, the value of\nthe rolling moment due to a sideslip angle p can be\nobtained from the equation\nwhere the appropriate values of Cb/r, obtained from\nfigure 16 at the relative distance equal to 1.0, are multiplied by the dihedral angle in radians. I n more\nunusual cases as, for example, where only the tips are\nturned up or where the wing is given a gull shape for\nany reason, it is stiU possible to determine a coefficient\nof rolling moment due to sideslip simply by adding the\neffects of the various parts in the way previously described. Thus, for the wing shown in figure 15, let\nA=6, X = l . O , ra and r,=o.l radian and assume that\nit is desired to find the proper value of CtB use in\nto\nequation (14). The part due to the tip portions A-A\'\nis A, (from fig. 16 (a)) X ra=0.195 X 0.1=0.0195.\nThe part due to the center portions C-C\' is As x r,=\n0.065X0.1=0.0065. The resulting value of Cb to\nbe used in equation (14) is thus 0.0130. The extension\nof this method to a curvilinear variation of r along\nthe span may be easily made by plotting the values of\nr at each point of the span and using the method given\nin a previous section for integrating for the total effect.\nThe results of figure 16 indicate that equivalent\nangle-of-attack changes caused by unit lengths of\ndihedral portion near six-tenths of the relative distance\nfrom the center are, in general, slightly more effective\nin producing rolling moment than unit lengths of dihedral at the tips. Such a result is due partly to the\nfact that the load curves near the tips are rounded and\npartly to the fact that, for the tapered wings, the larger\nareas affected by lengths of dihedral near the 0.6 point\ntend to compensate for the shorter moment arms\nthrough which the change i loading acts.\nn\n\n162\n\n7\n\nTHEORETICAL STABILITY AND CONTROL CHARACTERISTICS OF WINGS\n\nAlthough, during a sideslipping motion, positive\ndihedral produces a righting moment, a similar though\ngenerally smaller effect may also be produced by the\naddition of vertical area above the longitudinal wind\naxis. Also, on account of interference effects, the\nproportion of the airplane rolling moment contributed\nby the wings may vary considerably with the external\nappearance of the airplane.\nIt is usually considered, i practice, that a straight\nn\nwing will have some dihedral effect, but tests of Wings\nwith well-rounded tips (reference 5) do not support this\nuiew. I n cases of wings with blunt tips or in cases\nwhere chords of the sectians near the tip do not lie in\none plane, some dihedral action i s shown.\n\nIt will have been apparent from the preceding discussion that the results of figure 16 may also be applied\nto predict the rolling moment caused by an dlron\ndeflection in unyawed flight since ailerons, equally and\noppositely deflected, cause changes in the angle-ofattack distribution that are similar to the changes\ncaused by dihedral. Strictly speaking, however, the\nchange in angle of attack due to dihedral cannot have\nquite the same effect as a similar change produced by\nailerons because the ordinary lifting-line theory, when\napplied to yawed or sweptback wings, omits the effect\nof the stagger of the trailing vortices and the inclination\nof the bound vortex. Although the present theory has\nnot been modXed to take this effect into account, there\n.\n7\n.\n6\n\n5\n\n4\nk\n.3\n\n.E\n\n.I\n\nr,\nu\n\n.I\n\n.J\n\nflop o r ai/eron chord/Wng chord\nFIGURE\n18.-Vsriation of k with ratio of flap or ailoron chord to wlng chord.\n\nis ample justification for omitting it in the computations as experiments indicate only second-order differences (see reference 5) for the usual angles of yaw and\nsweepback.\nFor the computation of the rolling moment due to an\naileron deflection 6, the appropriate value of CI6to be\nn\ninserted i the equation\nFIGWEI?.-Comparison between experimental and computed values of Ct# (ox.\nperimontal data from referenca 6).\n\nLaireras=\n\nC&sb\n\n(15)\n\nmay also be found from figure 16.

Figure 20 i l s\nxs\nlutrates the mmponents of the section lift and drag\nvectors that produce yawing moments. The advanced\nwing having the larger lift will also have a larger induced\ndrag and hence a componentmoment is set up that tends\nto turn the wing so as to reduce the sideslip; at the same\ntime, however, the mntrq moment due to the components of the lift acts to advance the forward half of\nthe wing still more. As was the case with the yawing\nderivative due to rolling, the moments caused by the lift\ncomponen~predominate and, as a result, the net\ntheoretical moment is an unstable one; or, in other\nwords, with the system of axes chosen, a negative\nyawing moment results when the dihedral and sideslip\nangles are positive.\nThe explanations advanced in some textbooksneglect\nthe inward slope of the lift vectors and lead to an incorrect sign of the yawing moment.\nThe yawing moment in sideslip is given by the e q u e\ntion\nThe derivative Cn6is given in\n21 as a ratio in\ntern of ra because its value depends linearly upon the\nmagnitude of the product of these variables.

These curves may be used to\ndeterniine values of CnB any initial angle-of-attack\nfor\ndistribution symmetrical about the wing center line,\nprovided also that the angle of dihedral is constant\nacross the wing span. Although the rolling derivative\ndue to sideslip can be obtained (from fig. 16) for a curvil n a variation of dihedral along the span, it is necessaq\nier\nto stipulate that either a or r remain constant if the\nprinciple of superposition is to be applied in the determination of Cno. The combination of variable symmetrical twist and uniform dihedral being more common\nthan the converse, the computations were shortened by\nincluding curves for only the case of uniform dihedral.\nThe resultant value of C , (to be used in equation\n,\n(16)) is found by either an integration or a summation\nof the effects of elements of angle of attack extending\nalong the span. The process to be followed where\ngraphical evaluation is necessary has been illustrated\nin Sgure 10, with the ordinates of Sgure 10 (a) changed\nto ra. The ordinates and abscissas of the remaining\npsrts are to be changed as required. For untwisted\nWings with uniform dihedral, the value of Cno/rais\nobtained by multiplying the value read a t a relative\ndistance of 1.0 by the wing angle of attack and, i\nn\nturn, by the dihedral angle.\nThe curves of Sgure 21 being generally steeper beyond the 0.5 point, the deduction of increments of\n\nangle of attack a t the tip, i. e., giving the wing washout, would be the simplest means of decreaaing the\nunstable yawing moment caused by the wings in a\nsideslipping motion.\nAlthough the predicted variation of the yawing\nmoment with dihedral is confirmed, experiments show\na residual stable yawing moment a t zero dihedral that\ni not predicted by the ordinary theory. T i residual\ns\nhs\nmoment is greater for wings with blunt tips and i\ns\ngreater a t zero or negative lifts. It will be noted that\nthe theoretical yawing moment is itself the small resultant of two large contrary effects and is thus of the\nsame order as a number of possible secondaryinfiuences.\n\nLANGLEY\nMEMORIAL\nAERONAUTICAL\nLABORATORY,\nNATIONAL\nADVISORY\nCOMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTIC8,\nLANGLEY\nFIELD, April 19, 1958.\nVA.,\nREFERENCES\n1.

Special combindims of\ndisturlring factors to simulate gusts are considered and\nthe influence o lateral stability on the motions is discussed.\nf\nThe modifications o the airplane include changes of\nf\ndihedral from 0" to 10" and changes o the weathercock\nf\nstability from zero to Cn,=0.iS7 (the eguivalent o a fit&\nf\nas ,?urge as i O percent o the wing area). The positions of\nf\nthe modijied airplanes on the lateral-stability churts are\nshown.\nFin area and wing dihedral werefound to be o primary\nf\nimportance in side gusts. It was found that the roUing\naction of the wing with as much as 5" dihedral was dist i d y unfavorable, especially when the weathercock stability waa small. I t is pointed out that the greatest susceptibility to lateral disturbances lies in the inherent\ndamping and coupling moments developed by the wing.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nInherent stability, as defined in mathematical treatment, must be considered only one of several essential\nflying qualities of an airplane. Other important qualities belonging in this category are steadmess in rough\nair and responsiveness to control. Although the\ndifferent flying qualities depend largely on the same\ngoverning factors, they may not call for similar proportionings of the factors. It is known, for instance,\nthat the requirements for stability and control may\nconflict.\nWhat is ultimately desired, or course, is a definik\nunderstanding of the individual requirements for staf\nbility, control, and steadiness in rough air. Most o\nthe earlier work has been devoted primarily to the study\nof stability alone. A noteworthy early work on the\n)\neffects of gusts is that of Wilson (reference 1. More\nrecently the results of an investigation dealing with the\neffects of different degrees of stability on the motions\nfollowing assumed initial conditions have been published (reference 2 ) . The purpose of the present work\nis to study the amplitudes of the motions set up by\ngusts or other disturbances, particularly insofar as these\nmotions are affected by the lateral-stability characteristics. It i hoped that the study will be useful in\ns\n\nndicating combinations of stability characteristics\nkhat result in good riding qualities.\nThe mathematical treatment employed is, in prin.iple, an extension of that used by Wilson nntl other\nmrly writers. The methocls of calculation are, liom ever,\nnore concise and the development is not restricted to\nspecial types of gust. The operational method of\nresolving the effects of disturbances was used. (See\nFeference 3.)\nAccording to the theory, the motion caiisetl by any\n"andom variation or sequence of the disturbing factors\nnay be built up by superposing the effects of abrupt\nmit increases of the disturbance, which corresponds, in\nhhe case of gusts, to the effects of elementary sharp-edge\n:ross-currents. Thus the effects of random gusts can be\nargely visualized in the effect of a unit sharp-edge gust.\nSTABILITY FACTORS ASSUMED\n\nThe chief differences of lateral stability considered\nwere assumed to be brought about by changing the fin\narea and dihedral of a hypothetical small monoplane.\nDifferences in other proportions of most airplanes of\nconventional form have only secondary effects (in\nunstalled flight) and, furthermore, are not usually dictated by considerationsof stability. The exact arrangement of the hypothetical airplane, such as the vertical\ndisposition of the wing with respect to the fuselage,\nmay be taken as indefinite. Differences of arrangement can, of course, have large secondary influences on\nthe action of the fin or dihedral, which are usually\nattributed to aerodynamic interference. It is reasonable to assume that the effects of such interference will\nbe similar to the effects of actual changes in the size\nof the h or the amount of dihedral.\nThe airplane assumed in the calculations is a small\n1,600-pound monoplane having rectangular wings with\nrounded tips. The other proportions, including the\nradii of gyration about various axes, the tail length, etc.,\nare based on average values of these quantities for 21\nnumber of conventional machines. The stnbility derivatives and other characteristics of the airplane arc\nessentially the same as those used in reference 4,except\nfor the differences of fin area and dihedral, and apply to\npower-off e h t . The axes and symbols employed\nthroughout are given in detail in reference 4.

Different clisturbances will result in motions compounded of these\nthree modes in different proportions.\nTable I1 lists the roots, or stability indices, \xe2\x82\xacor the\nvarious cases considered. The first mode (corrcsponding to the root hl), represents primarily the lieavy damping of any movement involving rolling of thc wings rchtive to the air. At normal flight speeds, this damping\nis such that the wings are in a large measure constrained against such relative moverncnt normal to\ntheir chords.\n\n(a) C~=0.35; U0=150. p. s.\n1\n(b) C\xe2\x80\x98=l.O; Uo=88.5 f. p. s\n(c) C~=1.8; Uo=GG I. p. s.\n\nFIGURE\n1 --Stability chart showing positions of the assumed airplanes.\n\nTABLE 11.-STABILITY\n\nINDICES, RATES OF DAMPING, AND PERIODS\n(0.095 or\n-0.105)\n\n0.35\n1.0\n1.8\n\n.35\n1.0\n1.8\n.35\n1.0\n1.8\n.35\n1.0\n1.8\n.35\n1.0\n\nI. 8\n\n-5.477\n-3.255\n-2.533\n-5.472\n-3. m\n-2633\n-5.466\n-3. m\n\n-z a n\n-5.369\n-3.070\n\n-.2\n230\n-5.573\n-3.4R0\n-2.872\n\n0. 1%\n,212\n\n.273\n128\n.210\n\n.\n.mz\n.I T ,\n\n--.6080\n\n.258\n\n.1347\n\n.m\n.ID\n,225\n.m7\n.124\n\n.I s 9\n\n.MO\n\n__ - .\n.\n\n___- I - - -0.4190\n--.a74\n\n-. 0070\n.WX5\n\n.06M\n0\n\n.om\n.Mal\n\n.I770\n\n.m\n\n-.awl\n\n-.01R1\n\n-. 1045\n\na\n\n1.645\n\xe2\x80\x9c2.32\n\xe2\x80\x981 1.13\n15.0\n1.55\n1.53\nm\n\n1.133\niMi\n2. n\n\n.\n\n.137\n.TB\n\n2 (B\n5 71\n1. 005\n\n-0. 1720\n\n-.I386\n\n-. 1794\n\n-.495\n3637\n5247\n\n-_\n\n-.\n-. 680\n-. 4797\n-. 0075\n-.571\n-_\n529\n795\n423\n\n-.\n-.\n-. 235\n-. 3219\n\n.1\n\n-0.69\n\n.\n\n4.01\n4.98\n3.85\n1.39\n1.90\nI315\n1.44\n1.14\n1.21\n1.30\n\n2. 22\n\n0.708\n.f(211\n.

Normal stability of this mode represents the\nslow natural rccorery from a banlred turn. The rate\nof increase or decrease of the turning motion is slow,\nprimarily on account of the inseiisitiv-eness of the airplane to displacenient in bank and the strong rcsistance\nto rolling motion. The slow spiral always occurs with\ninward sideslip.\nThe third mode (X,) is the familiar oscillti tion, consisting usually of a yawing and sideslipping motion.\nSuch rolling as occurs in the oscillation is detrrnliried\nby the tendency of the wings to follow a path outlined\nby the dihedral in front view. The wing, when sideslipping, tends strongly to roll in a way involving the\nleast angle-of-attacli change along the span. Thus the\noscillations involve a \xe2\x80\x9cweathercoclrJ\xe2\x80\x99 motion combined\nwith a rolling nearly in phase with the sideslip.\nWith fairly large fin area, the oscillations are rapid\nand are quickly clamped. Under most conditions the\namplitude is small. As the fin area is reduced, however, the period becomes slower and, with normal\ndihedral, the oscillation takes on the character of a\nswinging in bank and sideslip under the action of\ngravity. The point of instability is reached when the\noscillation degenerates to an almost pure rolling and\nsideslipping motion, so that the damping derivative in\nyawing, Cn,, has little effect on the occurrence of\nundamped oscillations. As has been shown (reference\n4),unstable oscillations can readily occur if the airplane\nis constrained in yawing.\nAlthough both the oscillation and the slow mode of\nconvcrgence are largely governed by the fin area and\nthe dihedral, the rapid convergence AI is practically\nindependent of either of these factors. The damping\ncomes, of course, from the wings and is an inherent\ncharacteristic of conventional airplanes. This damping is excessive and is undesirable, since it indicates\ngreat sensitiveness to rolling gusts or to vertical gusts\nwith a gradient along the wing span. The damping of\nrolling can be reduced by increasing the lateral moment\nof inertia, but the possible improvement appears to be\nsmall.\n\nairplane. With conventional control devices, the disturbances do remain practically independent of tlie\nmotions. The orientation of the gusts is not dependent\non the motion of the airplane, and deviations caused by\nsuch outside disturbances will introduce changes in the\nmagnitudes of the disturbing factors themselves. For\nsmall displacements, these changes are of second order\nn\nand are negligible. For large displacements i gusts it\nmay, liowever, be necessary to cany out the caleulntion\ni several steps, altering the magnitude of the diiturbn\nnnce as the orientation of the relative wind changes.\nThe data needed for the computation of motion under\nany given set of conditions are the histories of motions\nfollowing sudden unit disturbances. Computations of\nsuch unit motions were made during the course of the\ninvestigation reported herein and the results were used\na s the basis for the more complete calculations given\nLater.\nSpecifically, the unit disturbance referred to is a\nforce (Y) or a couple ( L or N ) having the value zero\nup to the time t = O and maintaining a constant d u e\nthereafter. The magnitude is such as to cause a\nunit linear or angular accelerhtion of the airplane.\nAccording to well-known mathematical rules, the\nmotions under such conditions are given by equations\nof the form\n\np y ( t )= p , , ~ f p l , l e \xe2\x80\x9d f + p y 2 e X ? f + p y 3 ~ n f b(t+t,,)\ncos\n\n(1)\n\nrvlicre pya, p u t , arid t,Irare constants, calculated raliics\nof which are given in table 1 1 and A,, Xp, a+& and\n1,\na-ib are the roots, or stability indices. (See table\n11.) Three components of motion for each of three\ncomponent disturbanres are given. Thus, p&) denotes\nthe rolling velocity clue to a unit side disturbance\nBnd rL(t) denotes tlie yawing velocity due to a unit\nrolling disturbance.\n\nCALCULATED MOTIONS\n\nThe equations of motion of the airplane form a linear\nsystem so that the effects of disturbances can be compounded by addition. Thus, if any sequence of application of forces or couples to the airplane is given, it is\npossible to compute the resultant theoretical motion a t\nany instant by addition, or integration, of separate\neffects. The impressed forces or couples may he due\nto control manipulation or to gusts, alone or in coinbination.\nThe foregoing statement refers to a resolution of the\nimpressed disturbances along the axes fixed in the airplane.

The\ntime intervals within which the various modes diminish\nor increase by one-half, or by one-tenth in the case of\nkz (see table II), werc then spaced off on the abscissa\nand points on the curves were found by diminishing\nor increasing the ordinates successively as indicated\nby the sign of the root. The oscillatory mode was\nobtained by drawing in the envelope (given by +py3,\nsay) and spacing off the quarter periods, beginning at\nthe point indicated by the phase angle of this mode.\nThe cosine curve was then simply sketched in as shown.\nThe final curves were found to give remarkably good\nchecks when applied in the original differential equations o motion. Such a check shows the correctness\nf\nof both the method of plotting and the analytical\nsolutions (equation (1) and table 111).\nIf the impressed disturbance is given as a function\nof t by a curve, it will usually be sufficient to approximate this curve by the addition of a number of successive positive and negative steps. The combination of\nsteps necessary to reproduce the disturbance leads\ndirectly tr, the addition of the elementary motions for\nthe resultant motion. Otherwise, for example, if the\nvariation of disturbance is given by L(t),then the resultant motion p ( t ) at any t6imet due to L(t) beginning\nat t=O may be found by Duhamel\xe2\x80\x99s theorem, thus\np ( t ) due 10 o a r f a b l e r o z r f w momenl=p&(t) L(0)\nwhere pL(t) and p,(t-t,) are obtained from table 111.\nAn explanation and a graphical method for evaluation\nof such integrals are given in reference 3.\nMOTIONS IN SIDE GUSTS\n\nThe motion caused by a unit increment of gust\nvelocity is found by compounding elementary disturbances in such a way as to simulate the disturbing action\nof the gust. Thus, in a side gust of velocity vo, the disturbing acceleration along Y will be voY, and angular\nvo\ndisturbances will be vo L,, N,.\nAs explained before, the effects of any usual variation\nof gustiness can be largely foretold from the effect of a\nunit sharp-edge gust. The variable gust can be built\nup from small increment jumps of gust velocity corresponding to sharp-edge cross-currents and the final\nmotion will approach that obtained by superposing the\nmotions due to the individual elements.\nThe effect of a sharp gust from the side is similar to,\nalthough not exactly the same as, the effect of an initial\nangle of sideslip. For the side gust, it is necessary to\ntake account of the period of penetration of the airplane\ninto the current. The first effect will be to push the\nnose of the airplane downwind whereas an instant later\nthe current will strike the fin, turning the machine into\nthe gust. The action of dihedral in causing the machine to roll away from the gust will also occur be\xe2\x82\xacore\nthe fin is affected. These effects are, however, of short\n\n174\n\nduration and do not alter the motion to any great extent\nafter the first fraction of a second, except in cases of\nsmall weathercock stability where the fuselage contributes a large unstable yawing moment.\nThe computations that follow are based on the assumption that the rolling action of the gust begins a t\nt = O and that the yawing action begins when the airplane has traveled far enough to carry the fin into the\ncurrent. The case of Cn,=O was treated by assuming\na yawing couple equal and opposite to that of the 4-percent fin applied when t=O, this couple being neutralized at the instant the fin entered the gust.\nA possible further refinement of the calculations\nwould involve the delay in building up the full lift forces\non the various surfaces. Mathematical methods for\ndealing with various lags or rates of growth of the aerodynamic reactions have been developed, but their\ndescription is beyond the intended scope of the present\nreport. It may be said, however, that, for motions as\nslow as the natural oscillations of a rigid airplane, this\neffect (judging by the theoretical predictions) is quite\nnegligible.\nFigure 3 illustrates the results of the calculations\nbased on a IO-foot-per-second sharp-edge side gust.\nThe curves shown are for flight at C,=l.O but the\nsame general trends appeared in the calculations made\nfor other lift coefficients.\nThe most noteworthy difference shown is the effect\ni\nof deficiency of fn area on the banking motion (figs. 3\n(a) and 3 (b)). The airplane with IOo dihedral and\naverage fin was not displaced so much in bank by the\nside gust as was the airplane with 5 O &he&ral and a\nsmall f n The initial rate of rolling, however, was\ni.\ngreater with the greater dihedral.\nWith a given dihedral an increase of f n area cuts\ni\ndown the banlcing motion although, aIter a certain\nsize is reached, the gain becomes slight, as is illustrated\nby figure 3 (a). W,ith neutral weathercock stability\n(fig. 3 (c)) the change of heading on entering the gust\nis at first small and, although the motion is stable, the\noscillation in azimuth seems to be reinforced for a\ntime by the rolling. This action is to be attributed to\nthe phase lag between the r o l h g and the yawing effects\nupon penetrating the sharp-edge current. It scems\nprobable that an appearance of inherent instability\nmay be reached at a point considerably above the\nmathematical limit for undamped oscillations. (See\nfig. 1.) It is known, for instance, t,hat unstable oscillations may result from an attempt to hold the wings\nlevel with ordinary ailerons unless CnB a definite\nhas\npositive value.\nThe side gust is equivalent to a sudden shift in the\nwind directinn, corresponding to a change in azimuth\n# as indicated in figurc 3 (c). The normal airplane\n,\nswings about :ind tcricls to approach this hentling. I t\nwill be noted t l i a t the airplane with the large fin turns\nfairly sharply into the wind and, since the banking\n\nINFLUENCE OF LATERAL STABILITY ON DISTURBED MOTIONS OF AN AIRPLANE\n\n175\n\nREPORT NO. 638-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nmotion is small, tends to keep the same flight path\nrelative to the earth for a short time. After about 6\nseconds, however, tlie spiral divergence begins to be\napparent and the motion finally results in turning\ndownwind.\nAn example of extreme spiral divergence is illustrated\nby the airplane with no diliedral. In this case, however, the airplane banks and turns directly upwind.\nThe airplane with large dihedral illustrates the opposite condition and shows the predominance of oscillations that generally characterizes the effect of dihedral.\nHere the airplane tends back toward its original azimuth heading, drifting sidewise with the gust.\nThe airplane with 5\' dihedral banked rather sharply\naway from the gust, whereas the airplane with zero\ndihedral showed an undesirable tendency to bank and\nslide into the gust. It was therefore a matter of\ninterest to try some modifications lying in between\nthese two conditions. It was realized that the rolling\ncould not be entirely suppressed by such modifications\non account of the phase relationships involved in the\nmotions.\nIt appeared that lo or 2 O of effective dihedral would\ngive about the least banking motion in the side gust\nand hence this condition was investigated. Inasmuch\nas the airpltme might have shown a noticeable spiral\ndivergence a t low speeds with the normal fin area, this\narea was arbitrarily reduced, bringing the weathercockstability factor Cngdown in about the safne proportion\nas the dihedral factor C,. The values selected were\nCn,=0.025 and CIg=-0.035, which corresponds to\n2 O effective dihedral.\nThe position of this airplane on\nthe lateral-stability chart is denoted by the point A\nin figure 1 (b).\nThe results for airplane A are compared with the\nothers in figures 3 (a) and 3 (b). It will be noted that\nthe bank is somewhat smaller than in the case with 5 O\ndihedral and a large fin but that the bank persists for a\nlonger time. The difference made by the change from\n5 dihedral to 2\' seems surprisingly small. A some\'\nwhat greater difference would be expected if the fin\nhad not been reduced. It should be borne in mind\nthat the yawing disturbance is reduced by cutting down\nthe fin.\nThe curve for airplane B (fig. 3 (a)) shows the result\nof attempting to secure spiral stability (at C,=l.O)\nby cutting down the fin of the airplane with 5 dihedral.\n\'\n(Note that airplane A is slightly unstable.) Tlie value\nof CnSin this case is about half that assumed for the\nmean condition. (See fig. 1 (b).) The banking displacement seems nnclesirably large (coinpnrat3ively)iri\nthis case.\nOTHER TYPES OB GUST\n\nThe flight velocity of the airplane being normally\nlarge with respect to gust velocities, it is permissible to\nconsider the gusts as being stationary in time with\nrespect to the flight path. Thus the gusts are con-\n\n176\n\nsidered to exist as a fixed pattern in the air ahead of the\nairplane and not to vary in time within the short space\nrequired for the machine to travel its own length.\nAs mentioned before, when the airplane enters a\ncross-current in level flight, a gradient of sidewise\nvelocity along the length of the fuselage will exist.\nThe effect of this gradient is similar to the effect of a\nrelative yawing motion superposed on the side velocity.\nFor a uniform gradient the additional yawing moment\nwould be (-dv,/dx) XN,. The calculations involved\nthis factor by virtue of the time lag assumed in application of the yawing moment due to the fin, and upon\nthis basis they should be applicable to any roasonnble\nvariation or gradient of sidewise velocity.\nA somewhat different situation arises when the airplane is climbing or descending through a cross wind\nthat varies with height, as, for instance, when descending through the earth boundary layer for a cross-wind\nlanding, for then no perceptible gradient of sidewise\nvelocity along the length of the airplane will exist.\nThe motions that arise in these cases can be compounded\nby integration from the motion following an initial\nangle of sideslip. This motion is: not greatly differen6\nfrom that caused by entering a sharp cross-current and\nthe same general conclusions will apply.\nIt appears that a true yawing gust, consisting of pure\nangular relative motion of the air, could act only\nmomentarily on the airplane. The sidewise velocity\nwould predominate after the first two- or three-tenths\nof a second with the airplane flying a t normal speed.\nGradients of velocity along the wing span, however,\nmight persist for longer periods.\nAway from the ground influence, gradients of forward velocity and of vertical velocity along the wing\nspan must be considered as being about equally probable. At normal Aight speeds, the vertical gradients\nproduce by far the greater effects. As was mentioned\nbefore, the damping of relative rolling motion is such\nthat the airplane very quiclcly takes on the angular\nvelocity of the gust gradient.\nFigure 4 shows the rolling motion calculated for the\nmedium airplane ( 5 O dihedral and 6 percent fin) in a\nmomentary rolling gust pOb/2Uo=0.05. It will be\nnoted that the airplane takes on approximately half\nthe rolling velocity of the gust within one-fifth second.\nAs might be expected, observations have shown that\nvertical currents tend to diminish near flat ground.\nThus side gusts and yawing gradients are more likely to\naffect the airplane while it is landing and taking off. At\nvery low speeds with Aaps down, tlie rolling tlcrivtitivci\ndue to yawing becomes :IS grc:tt :IS that tlue to rolling\n(see t:it)le I) so t h t in this condition\n:tirplnnc is\n:illkcc.ted as much by spnwisc gratlicnts of 1ongitucliri:il\nvelocity xs it would be by the rolling gradients. (Note\nalso that the effect of the rolling gradients is less a t\nlow speed.)\nFigure 5 shows the banlcing reactions of the various\nairplanes in a sudden, persistent yawing-gradient gust.\nt\n\nh\n\nb\n\nINFLUENCE OF LATERAL STABILITY OP\n\nTime. sec\nFIGURE -Typical rolling motion caused by a sudden rolling gradient\n4\npob\n~\n~ 05(t>O), 0\n-\n\nU0=88 5 f. p s.\n\nIISTURBED MOTIONS OF AN AIRPLANE\n\nfirst second, since the disturbing factors (rolling\nl\nmoments due to yawing velocity) are the same in al\ncases. The subsequent motions show the influence of\ndifferent degrees of spiral stability and instability.\nThe primary dishrbing factor in the yawing-gradient\ngust being proportional to the derivative L, (rolling\nmoment due to yawing), the greatest room for improvement would be to reduce this derivative. Taper and\nwashout (such as are attained with a partial-span flap)\nare beneficial in this respect. It is estimated that L,\nmight have been reduced by one-third of the given\nvalue (see table I) at CL= 1.8 if a 50-percent-span flap\nhad been assumed. The effect of plan form is not so\npronounced, leading to a reduction of one-sixth for a\n4: 1 taper.\nI n general, a reduction of the rolling moment due to\nyawing seems desirable from considerations of lateral\nstability. The magnitude of this derivative with controls k e d is, like that due to rolling, primarily a consequence of the general lay-out of the airplane and is\nnot dictated by considerations of stability. It appears,\nhowever, that the magnitude of L, with controls free\n(or loosely held) could be reduced or reversed by making use of an appropriate combination of ailerons with\nincreased upward pressure (attained by cambering the\nailerons) and a differential linkage, as described in\nreference 10. An appropriate linkage would eliminate\nthe necessity of applying contrary aileron pressure\nduring steady\'turns and would also eliminate the spiral\ninstability with controls free.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nA s h d y ol tlic cfkcts of gusts givcs tlilrcwllrt indica-\n\nThe gust assumed corresponded to a difference of longitudinal velocity between the two wing tips of about 9\nfeet per second (7$/2Uo=0.05).\nAll the examples\nshow roughly the same banking tendency within the\n\ntions depcndirig on the interval of tiirrc consitlcrctl.\nDuring the first stagcs, the upsetting moveincnts of the\nstable airplane may be more severe than those of a\nslightly unstable one. If the airplane is under control\nand if the gusts are of noticeable magnitude, then the\nmotion during the first % o r 3 seconds is of primary\nconcern. For uncontrolled flight or for flight in relatively calm air wlierc disturbances could beconrc apparent only through introtlucing a clivcrgcnce, the 1:iter\nstnges of tlie motion are of interest.\nIn a consideration of the early stages of tlie inotion,\nit is evident that the requirements of fin area and\ndihedral for spiral stability a t low speed conflict somewhat with the requirements for steadiness in side gusts.\nIf spiral instability is present, the rates of divergence\nintroduced by various disturbances appear to be small\nas long as there is a moderate cliheclral action present.\nThe condition of zero (effective) dihedral leads, however, to definitely undesirable rates of divergence.\nIf average weathercock stability (cn8=0.05 to 0.07)\nis assumed, the optimum magnitude of the rolling derivative due to sideslip for steadiness in side gusts\nappears to be about C,,=-O.Ol to -0.04, correspond1\ning to an effective dihedral of \' or 2O.

The latter\nchange would lead to somewhat greater banking displacements in the gusts and would also be detrimental\nto aileron control, unless such control were obtained\nwithout adverse yawing moments.\nThe damping of rolling i such that the airplane very\ns\nquickly takes on any rolling component of gust velocity.\nThe usual modifications of the lateral-stability factors\nhave but little influence on the immediate effects of the\nrolling gust. An automatic device, acting so as to cut\ndown the damping of rolling (relative to the air),\nshould be advantageous from considerations of riding\ncomfort.\nThe effects of longitudinal gradients of gust velocity\nbecome fairly large a t low flight speeds. Noticeable\nimprovement can be obtained by the use of partialspan flaps or by otherwise concentrating the lift toward\nthe center of the wing, but this conclusion applies, of\ncourse, only as long as no portion of the wing is brought\nnear the stalling point.\n\nLANGLEY\nMEMORIAL\nAERONAUTICAL\nLABORATORY,\nNATIONAL\nADVISORY\nCOMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS,\nVA., June 8, 1958.\nL.4NGLEY FIELD,\n\n178\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

An essential feature of the problem\nis the determination of the influence of this wake on\nthe flow at the wing.\nIt is important to note that the wake is supposed\nto remain plane and undistorted. As 8 consequence of\nthis assumption, the effects of different wakes are\nadditive,.permitting the various flows to be built up by\nsuperposition. Thus, if the solution for the growth of\nthe increment of lift following a sudden change of normal velocity-or, what amounts to the same thing\nunder the assumptions involved, a sudden change in\nthe angle of attack-is known, this solution may be\nused as the element in an integral that gives the lift in\nany variable motion. With this point in mind, attention will at first be directed to the special case in which\nthe wing starts suddenly from rest at t =O with the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe two&ensional\npotential theory of airfoils in\nnonuniform motion was given by Wagner (reference 1)\nand has been &tended to problemsinvolving the motion\nof hinged or fl&ble airfoils by Theodorsen (reference 2)\nand Eussner (qference 3).\nIn the case of steady motion, a correction is known to\nbe necessary before the results of the two-dimensional\ntheory can be applied to wings of finite aspect ratio.\nA theory for the unsteady lift of k i t e wings was developed in reference 4. This theory has since been somewhat improved mathematically by making use of\noperational methods in the solution of the integral\nequations. (See reference 5.) The present repo t\ncombines t i previous work and extends the theory o\nhs\nshow the effects of gusts.\n\nl\n\nTHE INDICIAL LIFT\nINFJXENCE OF TEE W A K E\n\nOwing to the presence of circulation, the lifting wing\nleaves in its path a surface of discontinuity, the local\nvortex strength of which is determined by the rate of\nchange of circulation taken both across the span and\nalong the flight path. (See fig. 1.) The distribution\nof vorticity in the wake is determined by the assumption that the flow field at each instant conforms to the\n\n_v,\n\nStart\n\nf\nFIQWE1.-Flow c a d by wing starting from rest.\n\nnormal velocity w and the flight velocity Uo, the\nvelocities remaining constant thereafter.\nLIFT NEAR TEE START\n\nThe starting lift of any wing may be expressed by a\nsimple theorem based directly on the Kutta condition.\nAs a consequence of this condition, the portion of the\nwake adjacent to the trailing edge must move as an\nimpermeable extension of the wing surface. Thus, the\nfirst element of wake formed must move with the same\nnormal velocity as the wing. The flow produced a t\nthe first instant is what might be caused by the wing\nin process of growing wider at the rate Uowhile moving\nilownward with the velocity w. The starting lift may\nthen be thought of as the reaction to uniform motion\nIf the wing as a body with increasing mass:\nL=- dm\'\nat\n\nREPORT NO. 681-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMWTTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nwhere m\' is the mass representing the aerodynamic\ninertia of the wing in normal motion.\nIn order to apply equation (1) to the finite wing,\nthe inertia factor for such a wing must be known as a\nfunction of the width. Solutions for elliptic plates are\ngiven by the clmsical hydrodynamic theory, and these\nsolutions can be used to represent approximately the\ninitial rates of increase of inertia of wings of oval or\nelliptic plan form.\nThe distribution of potential over each chordwise\nsection of an elliptic plate in normal motion has the\nsame form as the corresponding two-dimensional\npotential. Thus\n\n#&\n+/\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E is the elliptic integral giving the ratio of the\nsemiperimeter to the span. At bhe normal velocity\nw=E, the potential distribution over any chord is\nrepresented by a circle having the chord as diameter.\nf\n(See fig. 2 . ) I the edge of the plate distorts into a\nslightly wider ellipse, the change in potential arisfng at\nany point will be measured by the difference between\nthe original and the slightly expanded circles. (The\nchange in the factor E during widening may be neglected for ordinary aspect ratios.) The pressure dif\nferenceacross the plate with changing potential is given\nby the formula\n(31\n\n4\n\ni\nI\n\n111\nW\n\nIntegration of this pressure over any section givea the\nift coefficient for angle of attack a of the plate,\n\n(7)\nwith each local center of pressure at the quarter-chord\npoint.\nThe start of the plane elliptic wing being equivalent\nb a uniform lengthening of each chord, the true elliptio\noutline is not preserved. Such a change, however, may\nbe shown to conform very nearly to a change into\nanother, slightly larger, ellipse at all points except those\nvery near the tips. Furthermore, if the wing is assumed\nto distort in any of a number of ways into a slightly\ndifferent elliptical plan form, the change of aerodynamic inertia will be found to be but little affected by\nthe change in shape and to depend primarily on the\nover-all change in size. Each such distortion can be\nthought of as representing a certain distribution of the\nstarting velocity U around the edge of the Wing.\nEquation ( 5 ) is exact for all distortions of this class,\nInasmuch as they may be made to fall on either side of\nthe distortion represented by U= bonstant (representing the start of the rigid wing), the equation is also\nconsidered applicable to this case.\nTHE DOWNWASH CORRECTION\n\nA reasonably accurate curve of the growth of lift\nmight now be drawn by connecting the starting value\n\n,l~\nBasic ffow\n\nvo U t\nFIQWE2.-The wske and the distrlbutionof potential over the chord shortly after\nthestart.\n\nand, from the geometry of the circle,\n\nThe pressure across the plate with the normal velocitj\nw=E and the flight velocity Uois, therefore,\n(6,\n\n196\n\nrrmsfwmed flow\nFIGWE\n3.-Elemeut of circulatory flow.\n\n(equation ( ) asymptotically to the known steady\n7)\nvalue given by the Prandtl theory.

A closer approach to the\ntrue form of the curve may be obtained by proceeding\non this basis.\nBefore the three-dimensional problem is considered,\nit\nbe helpful to review certain aspects of the twodimensional theory (reference 1). In order to make\nthe analysis nondimensional, a l velocities are expressed\nl\nin terms of the flight velocity Uoand all lengths, in\nterms of the half chord.\nFigure 3 shows the elementtwo-dimensional flow\nused as a starting point by Wagner (reference 1).\nThis flow is caused by two vortices, representing, respectively, an element of circulation around the wing\nand the vortex left in the wake when this circulation\noriginated. The streamlines of this flow are eccentric\ncircles. One such circle (of unit radius) is chosen to\nrepresent the wing section and the axes are so placed\nthat this circle has its center at the origin. The geometry of the resulting pattern is such that, when the\nwake vortex is a t z, the Wing vortex will be at l/z.\nThis spacing preserves the unit circle as a streamline\nof the flow.\nTransformation of the pattern by the formula\n\nIn essentially the manner described, Wagner (refernce 1) calculated the two-dimensional flow around a\nring section following a sudden Uuit change in angle of\n-ttack. The integrated pressures over the airfoil give\n, lift coefficient that asymptotically approaches the\naown steady value 2 ~ whereas the starting lift\n;\noefficient is found to be exactly one-half this value.\nLe center of pressure remains a t the quarter-chord\n\xe2\x80\x98\nh\n)oint throughout the motion.\nIn the ca4e of the finite Wing, an element of the wake\nv i l l be as depicted in figure 3 but d, addition,\ni\nn\n:ontain vortices completing each circuit to the wing\n!bough the tips. The length of the tip vortices may\n)e approximated by assuming that they extend to the\n:hordwise centroid of the wing circulation.

The transformed pattern thus represents the circulatory flow around a flat wing section\nwith an associated countervortex in the wake. In the\ntransformation, the centroid of Wing vorticity remains\nat the position of the original bound vortex while the\nwake vortex is shifted forward somewhat as shown\n(fig. 3).\nEach elementary flow of the type shown contributes\na certtiii velocity around the trailing edge of the airfoil.\nThe flow due to an instantaneous change of angle of\nattack of the airfoil may be superposed on these flows\nand will contribute a trailing-edge velocity of opposite\nsense. On this basis, the problem of circulation with\nvarying angle of attack may be solved by an inverse\nprocedure. Assume some convenient distribution of\nwake vorticity and cailculate (by integration) the trailing-edge velocity at each point along the flight path\ncorresponding to the prescribed wake. The particula1\nvariation of angle of attack necessary to cancel this\ntrailing-edgeflow a t each instant (Kutta condition) can\nthen be determined. I a number of such curves arc\nf\nfound, they may be added in various ratios so as to\napproximate some prescribed variation of angle 01\nattack; the corresponding circulation c u v w are added\nin like ratios.\n\nz\n\nsalculation, the equivalent length of the tip vortices\nin terms of the distance traveled s reduces to\n\nz= Js (s+2)\n\n(9)\n\nfigure 4 iUustrates the rapid travel of the centroid of\ndiscontinuity within the wing subsequent to its initial\nposition at the trailing edge.\xe2\x80\x98 It is seen that, after a\ntravel of several chord lengths, the centroid may be\nhs\ntaken at the middle of the wing section. T i assumption will later be used.\nFigure 5 shows how an elementary loop vortex in the\nwake of a finite wing can be formed by cancelation from\nan element of the wake of an infinite wing.

Another problem of considerable interest is the prediction\nof lift during passage of the airfoil through gusts.\nThe two-dimensional theory for this case was developed\nby Kiissner (reference3) and has since been corrected in\ncertain details by von K&rmBnand Sears (reference 8).\nThe basic solution required in the gust problem is\nthe solution for a unit sharp-edge gust of uniform upward velocity.

The lag functions shown in figures 5 and 6 give the lift quite accurately during any motion that can be compounded of frequencies lower than one\n8\nn\n.5.\ncycle in 1 half chords ( < 0 3 )\n\nI will be noted that these expressions differ from\nt\nthose assumed by Cowley and Glauert in two ways. First,\nthe value of the function from 0 to 2 is not zero but\nis a positive value, which accounts for the upwash that\nthe tail initially encounters. Second, the distance after\nwhich the value of the function becomes negative is not\nequal to the tail length, 2, but occurs at a distance\nsomewhat greater than the tail length. This distance accounts for the lag in the growth of downwash and the lag\nin the development of lift by the tail and may be called\nthe effective tail length.\n212\n\nNACA Technical Note No. 771\n\nAlthough t h e r e s u l t s t h u s f a r have been obtained f o r\none s p e c i f i c wing and t a i l arrangement, t h e e f f e c t i v e t a i l\nl e n g t h and t h e magnitude of t h e e f f e c t t o be expected may\nbe determined f o r o t h e r cases.\nAccording t o t h e t h e o r y , t h e p a t t e r n of t h e wake\nformed by t h e wing remains unchanged as i t passes downstream.

In order to make specificrecommendaCalculatwns are based on typical airplane characteristics tions applicable to modern design, a study of stability\nwith certain factors varied to cover a range of current more complete and detailed than any available was\ndesigns. Stability charts are included to show the limiting undertaken. Calculations were made covering both\nvalues of the aerodynamic hinge moments and the weight longitudinal and lateral motions and the elevator-free,\nhinge moments of the control surfaces for various positions the rudder-free, and the aileron-free conditions. The\nof the center o gravity of the airplane and for control computations were based on a set of typical airplane\nf\nsystems with various moments of inertia.

The boundaries given in\nthe stability charts are therefore of value chiefly as\nindications of the effect of certain design factors; they\ns\nare useful quantitatively only a outside limits, not to\nbe approached too closely. Further experiments will\nbe necessary to determine the margin of stability required for smooth operation in gusty air.\nOn the other hand, the charts are to a certain extent\nconservative because they do not take into account the\npossibility of friction of the control system, a factor\nthat would widen the margin of stability.\nThe indications of the present study may be summarized as follows:\n1. There is a limit to the effectiveness of the aerodynamic balance that may be safely employed with\nany conventional control system. I n most cases, it\nappears difficult to secure stability with the hinge\nmoment reduced to less than 25 percent of its value\nfor the unbalanced surface.\n\n2. Reduction of the floating moment Cbm2 it can\nif\nbe brought about independently of a\naerodynamic balance, causes a shift d the boundary\nfor divergence. (Cf. figs. 3 and 7 and figs. 12 and 13.)\nThe effect is particularly noticeable i &e m e o the\nn\nf\nrudder, where the likelihood of this form of instability\ni materially decreased.\ns\n3. Within the usual range of chambrktics, the\nElevator and the aiIeron controls are\nssuseeptible\nto oscillatory instability than to the rapid\ndivergent instability. The stability with either of\nthese controls free may be improved by (a)using a less\neffective aerodynamic balance, (b) decreasing the mass\nmoment and the moment of inertia of the control, or\n(e) using a control surface of narrow chod.\n4. Divergence is a more likely form of h h b i l i t y for\nided\nthe rudder control (figs. 10 and 11) and\nbalby reducing the effectiveness of the\nance or, as has been suggested, by us\nthat\nreduces the floating tendency of the rudder>although a\nhighly effective balance of a type thah reduces the\nfloating tendency may result in oscillatory instability.\n5.

The construction i s cssentially that used\nin deriving the familiar Joukowski airfoils from a circlr\n(reference 1) although i t may be applicd to an airfoil\nshape to introduce modifications of thc outline. Thr\nmethod is based on tho conccpt of complex numhrrs\nbut its application requirrs no familiarity with tlicm.\nBy two or more successivc applications of the construction to a circle, it is possible to derive shapcs of\nsuch diversity as to permit the approximatioil of near17\nany airfoil of current design. For the airfoil derived\nin this way the pressure distribution can be determined\ncxactly, so that thr only error likely to occur is in thc\nrcproduction of the exact airfoil shape. Any inaccuracy\nin this approximation is immccliatcly apparent and can\nbc made as small as is considered tlcsirablr.\n\npoint of the modified airfoil, then, is located by the\nresultant of the vector Oz and its reciprocal vector.\nThe construction by which a figure is modified applies equally well to all its streamlines, altering them\nto conform to the distortion. The change in spacing\nof the streamlines near the boundary of the figure will\nshow directly the effect of the transformation on the\nvelocity in that region because the velocity varies\ninversely with the spacing.

It\nIS sometimes required to predict the theoretical cliarachistics of an airfoil not dcrivcd in this way. I n such\ni\ncase, it is customary to use tlie known flow around a\nirclc as a starting point. If the transformation\n$iscussed licre is applied to 5 circle, the result is an\nmal shape with circular-arc camber, as demonstrated\nby Joukowski. (Scr rrfcrcncc 1 .) It should be possible\nto procrecl to modify t,liis figurc (or its special form, a\nJoukowski airfoil) as was tlonc in tlir prcccding section\nto an cxprrimrntally known airfoil. I n gcncral, liowcver, it woiiM requirc. many stGps to reproduce an\narbitrary airfoil in this way bccausc modifications of\ntlic sliapc alrracty approaching an airfoil would, of\nnccessicy, be small and localizcd. On tlic other hand,\nif tlic procedure were reversed, it would be found that\nariy airfoil may be derivcd by a single step from a\nfigure closely approximating a circle, a figure which\nwill Iirrrinaftcr bc callcd tlic \xe2\x80\x9cdistorted circle\xe2\x80\x9d of the\nairfoil. Tlir distorted circlc may thcn be considerrtl\ntlic result of modifying a cirrlc, a result obtained in\ntlic samc way as were the slightly modified airfoils of\ntlic prccrding section.\nFor t,lic first step in this proccse, thc clc+rminatiori\nof the tlistortrd circlr corresponding to tlie desirrd\nairfoil, rcfercnrc could br niadc to Theodorscn antl\nG:irri.ck (rrfcrcwx ?) or von KBinih and Rurgrrs\n(rrfrrcncc 3), who givr exact formulas for tlie distortctl\ncircle ill tcrms of tlir airfoil coordirmkrs.

The const.ruction\nare\nthen proceeds as follows:\nI n order to serve as a first approximation of the\ndistorted circle, a circle is drawn to fit thc four intersections with the axes as closely as possiblo. It should\nbe remembered that, because this step is a first approximation, great accuracy is not a consideration. W i e n\nthe vectors z follow this circle, the vectors k2/z, constructed as previously described, are found to terminate\nin a smaller circle, which is termed for convenience the\n\xe2\x80\x9creciprocal\xe2\x80\x9d circle. This reciprocal circle may be easily\nlocated from its intersections with the axes (fig. 3 (c)).\nk2\nVectors Oz and 0- are then dralin from the origin\nZ\n\nto t.he circle and to the reciprocal circle at equal angles\nbelow and above the x-axis (fig. 3(d)). The midpoint\nz,\xe2\x80\x99 of t,he diagonal z-k2!z connrcting the ends of thew\nvectors will not, in general, fall exactly on thc airfoil.\nA point of the distorted circle zb is located by adjusting\nwith dividers the lrngth of Oz, along Oz so that thc\ndiagonal to its reciprocal is bisected by the airfoil.\nThe point of the airfoil z, n t which this bisection occurs\nwill actually be indistinguishable from tlie intersection\nof tlie first diagonal uith the airfoil: this fact is useful\nin making the correction. Because tlic corrections to\nk2\nthe vectors Oz and 0- are in approximately the samct\n2\n\nratio as the vectors. the decrcwe in K\xe2\x80\x99/z that corresponds to an increase in the length of Oz may be rstimated and the reciprocal relation bc maintained by\neye. Any desired degree of accuracy niny be obtniiietl\nby checking numerically the lcrigtlis of thc vcvtors.\nThe distorted circle obtained in this way must now\nbe approximated by applying a transformation of tlir\nform z+k2/z to the circlc most ncarly approximating it.\nFor this purpose the circlc already drawn for the prcccding step will usually bc satisfactory, although it\nmay have to be shifted slightly to obtain a more convenient distribution of the distortion. Depressions\nshould occur as nearly as possible on opposite sides of\n&he circle, with distended portions between them.\n(See fig. 3(e).) The x-axis should then be passed\nthrough the distended portions and the y-axis, through\nthe depressions. Some adjustment will be nccclcd to\nsatisfy the condition that the segments of the axes c u t\noff by the eirclc and the rorresponding distortions bc\napproximately in inverse proportion, that is, that their\nproduct at, racli intersection bc constant. The parameter k for the transformation is then the square root\nof this product.\nCarrying out tho transformation of tlie circle a t\nthis point serves a t onee to check thc cstimntcd parameters or to suggtbst an adjustment and to provide thc\nconstruction lines that will be needed to determine thc\nvelocity distribution. Similarly, thc distorted circle\nthus obtained from tlic circlc should bc reduced to tlie\ndesired airfoil.\nIn figure 3(f) thc complctc double transformation\nand the lincs neccssary for the computation of the vcloc-\n\n2 40\n\nity distribution are aiown applied to L poiiit of thc\ncircle of figure 3(e).\nOccasionally an airfoil will give fisc to a distorted\ncirclc that cannot be obtaincd by a singlc modification\nof a circle. I n such a casc an additional transformtition may bc applied either to acliicvc tlic dcsircrL\ndistortion of thc circlc or to modify locally an airfoil\nthat can be derived by two transformations.\nVELOCITY DISTRIBUTION OVER AN AIRFOIL DERIVED\nFROM A CIRCLE\n\nIt is apparent that a large variety of uscful airfoil\nshapes can bc obtaincd by two or more successive applications to a circle of the transformation z+k2/z.\n(Two typical examples are shown in fig. 4.) Tho first\ntransformation primarily determines the gcneral outline\nof tlic airfoil. The second transformation reduces the\nfigure to the dimensions of an airfoil and clctermincs\ntho nose radius, the thickness, and the camber. It\nmay be of interest to note that in the first transformation k is small relative to the radius of the circle; in\nthe second transformation thc ratio of k to the radius\nof thc circle is only slightly less \xe2\x80\x98than 1.\nThe mctliod of finding the velocity a t a point on an\nairfoil derived in this manner is deduced from the\nfollowing considerations:\nThe velocity n t a point z on the circlv i s givcii by\nthe formula\nVz=2V, sin\n\nr\ne+- 2n-r\n\nwliere r is the radius of tlic circlc, ,\xe2\x80\x99\\ is tlic wind vcLlocity, and e is tlic angle that t,hc radius to tlir point z\nmakes with the tlirvctiori of thc air strcam.

JONESt\nNational Advisory Committeefor Aeronautics\nsection theory the magnitude of the\ncirculation, and hence of the lift, is determined by\nthe velocity that would be induced near the trailing\nedge of the section in a non-lifting potential flow. In\nthree-dimensional flow the problem is complicated by\nthe presence of the wake and no simple basic solution\nhas been found. Treatment of the problem of a wing of\nfinite span has therefore been on the basis of the twodimensional theory, corrected for the effect of the\nwake.*\nThe correction commonly applied is that introduced\nby Prandtl and known as the lifting-line theory. The\ndownflow induced by the wake is considered, in this\ntheory, to reduce the relative normal velocity and hence\nthe edge velocity of the wing. It is assumed, however,\nthat once the true angle of attack is determined for any\nsection of the wing its effect in producing circulationand\nlit is the same as in two-dimensional flow. This assumption is expressed by the equation\n\nI\n\nN THE WING\n\nc, = 2r(a - aj)\n\nIf the velocity distributions of the circulatory flow\nare also assumed to be similar to those given by the\nwing-section theory, the circulation required to satisfy\nthe Kutta condition at each section should be reduced\nby the same factor. The corrected formula for the\nlift is then\n\nc\n,\n\n= (27r/E)(a -\n\ncyi)\n\n(21\n\nThis correction may be given a physical interpretation by considering that a finite wing offers a longer\nedge around which the air may escape (see Fig. l),\n\nFIG.

(1) takes into account the effect of the wake in\ndiminishing the relative normal velocity of the wing. A\nfurther correction is indicated by the fact, established in\nhydrodynamic theory, that the surface velocities induced by a given relative motion of a body in-threedimensional flow are generally smaller than those in\ntwo. For example, the maximum, or \xe2\x80\x9cedge\xe2\x80\x9d velocity\naround an infinite cylinder is 1, while that around a\nsphere of the same cross-section is \xe2\x80\x99/2. Similarly, if the\nvelocity around the edge of an endless thin plate is\ntaken as unity, the corresponding velocity around the\nedge of a circular disc is found to be 2/7r, or 0.637.\nIn the case of an elliptic disc the velocity at every\npoint is reduced by the factor 1/E, where E is the ratio\nof the semiperimeter of the ellipse to the span. (See\nappendix.) Further investigation shows that the\nchordwise cross-sections of the non-lifting potential\nflow are similar all along the span o the elliptic plate\nf\nand are the same as those obtained from the wing-section theory except for this constant reduction factor.\nReceived July 31, 1941.\nt Assistant Aeronautical Engineer.\n* More recently the problem has been treated on the basis of\nthe acceleration potential, which vanishes i the wake.\xe2\x80\x99 The\nn\nmethod is still one of considerable a c u l t y , however.\n\nand that the air velocities are therefore less in the proportion that the length of the edge is greater. The rule\nis not exact for plan forms other than the elliptical.\nSince the velocity of the non-lifting potential flow\nis constant all around the edge of the elliptic plate, the\ncirculation required will be proportional to the chord at\neach section. The circulation is thus elliptically distributed spanwise. Such a distribution, with the chordwise distribution assumed earlier, leads, as in the liftingline theory, to the relation\nL Y ~=\n\nCJTA\n\n(3)\n\nwhere A is the aspect ratio.\nq\nSubstitution of this value into E . (2) gives\n\nC,\n\n=\n\nBnorA/[EA\n\n+ 2)\n\n(4)\n\nSince the chordwise distribution of the circulation in\nthree-dimensional flow is assumed similar to that in\ntwo, and since the similarity is only proved for the noncirculatory flow, Eq. (4) must be considered a correction of the wing-section theory rather than a solution\nof the three-dimensional problem. The assumption of\nsimilarity, although its validity is subject to somewhat\nthe same limitations in general, appears to be a more\njustifiable one than the assumption of equality made\nin the lifting-line theory.\nThe problem of three-dimensionalflow around a lifting elliptical plate has been treated by Krienes2 using\n\n247\n\nL I F T O F ELLIPTIC W I N G S\n\nW\n\n7\n\n8\n\n6\nA\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\'\n0\n\nI\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\nASKl RmO.

The\ncalculations involve the superposition of a series of\nsolutions of Az4 = 0 in ellipsoidal coordinates (Lam6\nfunctions), the coefficients of the series being obtained\nfrom simultaneous equations. Although the overall\nlift depends on only one coefficient, calculations of the\nspan loading and the drag would require all the terms\nof the infinite series and was therefore not considered\npracticable.\nThe lift coefficients obtained by Krienes\' method are\nshown in Fig. 2. Results obtained by correcting the\nwing-section theory in accordance with Eq. (4) are\ncompared with Krienes\', and the agreement is seen to be\ngood for ordinary aspect ratios.\nA m e derived from Blenk\'s calculationof the vortex\ndistribution in a rectangular plate3 also agrees closely\nwith Eq. (4).\nIt is found that the additional correction to the wingsection theory accounts for an appreciable fraction of\nthe loss in lift that is usually attributed to viscosity. It\nhas been difficult to reconcile the magnitude of the inefficiency with the observed dimensions of the wake,\nwhich in the case of smooth wings, is extremely narrow\na t the trailing edge. The foregoing correction accounts\naf\nfor as much as h l of this discrepancy in cases of wings\nwith sharp trailing edges. (See Fig. 3.)\nAccording to Munk\'s theorem, the induced drag is\nnot affected by a displacement of the lifting elements\nin the direction of the chord; hence the relation between the lift and the induced drag may be derived on\nthe basis of the lifting-line theory. Also, since the pitching moment of the elliptic wing involves the same correction as the lift, no change of aerodynamic center\nlocation with aspect ratio is indicated.\nThe three-dimensional potential flow around the\nelliptic disc may be used also as the basis for calculating\nthe lift of an elliptic wing with varying angle of attack.\nOn account of the linearity of the equations, the general problem may be reduced to a determination of the\ngrowth of lift following a sudden start of the motion with\nthe fight velocity V and the normal velocity w = Va.*\n\n4\n\ni23\nCONMNTION41WING\nW N G WITH SHPRD ll&UNG EDGE\nW WITH BLUNT W H G E E\nG\nK\noRLlPTlCAl CWNDER\n\n0\n1\n0\nt 2O\nTHICKNSS R W , r\n\n0\n\nFIG. Experimental and theoretical lift-curve slopes.\n3.\nAspect ratiq. 6.\n\nSince the steady or asymptotic value of the lift is\nalready known, the most important point is the determination of the lift near the start of the motion.\nAs a consequence of the Kutta condition, the layer of\nair leaving the wing at the trailing edge must satisfy\nthe same boundary condition as the adjacent wing surface for a short distance downstream. Thus the layer\nof air in contact with the wing retains the motion imparted by the wing and for a short distance after the\nstart this layer (the vortex wake) behaves as an impermeable extension of the wing surface.\' The flow a t\nthe first instant after, the start is thus what might be\ncaused by the wing in process of growing wider a t the\nrate V while moving with the normal velocity w.

This is a problem in the\ncalculus of variations, in which the expression for the\neffectiveness is the integral to be kept constant; the\nexpression for the hinge moment is the integral to be\nminimized; and the hinge line, defined by a relation\nbetween the spanwise station and the ratlio of flap\nchord to airfoil chord, may be considered the path of\nintegration to be determined so as to satisfy the foregoing conditions. I n the case of a rudder or an elevator,\nthe effectiveness is measured by the change of lift on\nthe tail surface produced by deflection,of the flap; in\nthe case of ailerons, it is measured by \'the rolling moment produced.\nIt will be seen in the course of the discussion that\nall constant factors may be combined in the final result\nINTRODUCTION\ninto a single factor of proportionality. All the funcOne of the primary difficulties in airplane design has tions and relations discussed hereinafter d l therefore\nbeen to keep the stick forces required to deflect the be treated without regard to such factors.\nThe following symbols will be used in the developcontrol surfaces at reasonably low values. This problem has inevitably increased in seriousness with the ment:\nspan of airfoil\nsize and the speed of modern airplanes. There is as b\nspanwise station measured from plane of\nyet, however, no basic principle of control-surface Y\nsymmetry\ndesign that engineers will agree minimizes the ratio of bl2\nstick force to effectiveness. Examination of typical O=eos-Ix parameter indicating spanwise station\ndesigns indicates that hinge-moment reductions as\nbI2\nlift per unit span at any section due to unit\ngreat as 40 percent may be achieved in some cases A h\nflaD deflection\nwithout lowering the effectiveness of the flap; that is,\nchange in effective angle of attack a t any\nthe efficiency may be increased by two-thirds.\nsection due to unit flap deflection\nThe present study, which neglects structural and\nsection l i t coefficient\nsimilar considerations, is a mathematical analysis leadchord of airfoil\ning to the plan forms for rudder, elevator, and ailerons\nchord of flap\nthat will be most effective in producing a given amount\nratio of flap chord to airfoil chord (c,/c)\nof control with the least operating force.

In figure 3, the shapes for\nthe movable surfaces are shown for the three airfoils\njust described. The optimum ailerons are seen to vary\nhardly a t all from airfoil to airfoil. The outlines for\nmaximum lift efficiency, although differing slightly,\n\n311\n\nREPORT NO. 731-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nnevertheless suggest the general conclusion that the\nmost desirable control surfaces in this respect are of\nnearly constant chord.\nFrom this result it follows that the most efficient\nairfoil plan form for longitudinal control is also one of\nnearly constant chord, because such a combination of\nairfoil and flap will have a nearly uniform distribution\nBlunt\n\nHinge\nline\n\ne\n\nin any case, to hold rigidly to the optimum shape a t\nthe extreme tip if such a design introduces a cusp in\nthe k e d portion of the surface.\nThe corresponding presentation of the solution for\nthe ailerons is given in figure 5. The ailerons shown\nwe approximately 15 percent of the mean chord of the\n&foil. Seen in this aspect ratio, the ailerons appear\nnot to vary greatly in width over their span. As is to\nbe expected, however, they do taper off somewhat\nGoward the center where the small moment arm would\nIbviously make a larger area inefficient.\nThe choice of a straight hinge line has led to the introluction of sweepback in these plan forms. It should\nbe remembered, however, that the solutions as expressed\n>y figure 3 are mathematically very general ones and\n:over, w i t h the limits of accuracy of the lifting-line\ntheory, any width of flap, any shape of hinge line or\nparter-chord line, and any normal aspect ratio.

Calculations also show\nthat, if each of the airfoils given by the foregoing distributions were provided with a flap of optimum shape, a\nsomewhat smaller movable surface, and hence a smaller\nhinge moment, would be required to increase the lift\non the blunt wing a given amount per unit deflection\nthan on either of the other two. On the other hand,\nsince aileron effectivenessdepends on the ratio of rolling\nmoment to damping moment, a tapered wing is seen to\nbe most efficient for lateral control.\nIn figure 4 the flaps are plotted in relation to the\nairfoils. The flaps as drawn are 20 percent of the mean\nchord of the airfoil. It will be noted that, for the\ntapered airfoil, this is the maximum width at which the\nshape of the flap can be maintained. Ordinarily as\nhigh a taper as shownwouldnot be used and a 20-percent\nor wider flap would be possible.

Thus, the\naspect ratio enters the solutions only in so far as it limits\nthe applicability of the lifting-linc theory. The solulions are also expected to apply in a general way to\n\nDETERMINATION O F OPTIMUM PLAN FORMS FOR CONTROL SURFACES\n\nunsealed flaps which, although less effective than sealed\nflaps, may be supposed to show similar variations of\neffectiveness with chord.\nA separate investigation was made to determine on\nwhich of the airfoils considered the derived control\nsurfaces would produce the most lift for a given hinge\nmoment, with a view to estimating the loss resulting\nfrom the use of a tapered stabilizer. The calculated\ndifference of 8 percent between the tapered and the\nblunt airfoils was not so great as might have been\nexpected. It is supplemented, however, by other aerodynamic effects such as fuselage interference, which\nmay make the use of area near the fuselage inefficient.\nAilerons on a blunt wing would similarly give more\nrolling moment for a certain hinge moment than on a\nmore tapered wing. Since the tapered wing requires\nless powerful ailerons because of the small damping\nmoment, the actual rate of rolling would be definitely\ngreater for a given hinge moment; thus in the last\nanalysis, the tapered wing must be considered the most\nefficient from considerations of aileron control.\n\nEaps for greatest efficiency are dso indicated by these\nf\n:onsiderations. I the ratio for a given shape is everywhere the same, the greatest lift or rolling moment must\nbe contributed by the element of the h p that has the\nmaximum chord (and therefore the maximum hinge\nmoment). I any other element of equal span is to be\nf\nused to develop the same lift, that element must either\nbe deflected through a greater angle or increased in\nwidth. It is assumed that the maximum degree of\ncontrol possible within the efficient range of f h p deflection, which is about +20\xc2\xb0, is desired, and the control\nshould therefore not be increased at the expense of\n\nPARTIAL-SPAN FLAPS\n\nAt this point a question arises as to the design of\npartial-span flaps, their shape, optimum length, and\nlocation. The most efficient shape for such flaps can\nbe deduced from a review of the preceding developf\nment. I a portion of the airfoil span has no movable\narea, the value of Aa, will be zero over that region and\nthe expressions for A, and A, given in equations (14)\nand (15) will reduce to integrals covering only flapped\nportions of the span. The limits for H given in equation (16) may be similarly changed. Then the reasoning remains the same; only the limits of integration are\nchanged to agree with the extent of the flap and, these\nlimits being identical for the functions involved, the\nrelations between the integrands may be expressed as\nbefore and the same solutions will be obtained. It\nfollows that flaps extending over a part of the span of\nan airfoil should have the same shape as the portion of\na flap of optimum shape covering that same part of\nthe span.\nAnother interesting characteristic of these shapes,\none from which further deductions concerning partialspan flaps may be made, appears when the solution\ngiven in equation (19) is substituted in expressions\n(14), (15), and (16) for the effectiveness and the hinge\nmoment. It is seen that the integrands of these expressions are identical except for the discarded factors of\nproportionality. This fact may be interpreted as\nmeaning that the surfaces found have, for any particular solutipn, a constant ratio of effectiveness to hinge\nmoment all along the span, or that any portion of a\ngiven flap of optimum shape is as efficient as any other\nportion.\nThis characteristic leads again to the conclusion that\npartial-span flaps should be segments of the optimum\nfull-span shapes.

If the chord is increased, it will be\nwith the square of the lift (equation (13)) and the\nhinge moment will then be increased with the square of\nthe chord (equation (16)) or the fourth power of the\nlift. The conclusion is obvious: The most efficient\nflap of a given span will cover the portion over which\nthe ordinates of figure 3 are the greatest. This result\nis of particular significance as applied to ailerons, which\nshould therefore extend inward from the tips.\nIt also follows that the greatest efficiency is obtained\nby using the longest possible control surfaces. Shorter\nflaps must of necessity be wider to produce the same\neffect, and the increase in chord causes a sharp drop\nin efficiency. This consideration should influence not\nonly the design of the flaps but also the design of the\ntail surfaces themselves.\nFigures 6 and 7 are a quantitative representation of\n\n313\n\nREPOR\xe2\x80\x99I\xe2\x80\x98 NO. 73 1-NATONAL\n\nAUVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nthe situation.

For\nexample, if on a particular wing only tlic outrr GO pcrcctnt\nof the optimum ailerons of a certain percentage chord\nwere used, approxhately 16 perccnt of the rolling moment would be sacrificed.

The present report continues\nthe investigation with special reference to transient e$ects for\nmaneuvers o short duration.\nf\nThe analysis made showed that dijerent combinations o\nf\nelevator parameters which give the same stick force per unit\nacceleration in turns give wiclely dijerent force variations during\nthe entries into and recoveries f r o m steady turns and during\nmaneuvers o short duration such as abrupt pull-ups. A comf\nf\nf\nbination o relatively large negative values o the restoring tendency C,,, and theJloating tendency Chal7approaching those o\nf\na n unbalanced elevator, results in a stick force that is high during\nthe initial stage o a pull-up and then decreases, and may even\nf\nreverse, as the acceleration i s reduced at the end of the maneuver.\nThe stick force per unit acceleration i s greater for abrupt than\nfor gradual control movements.\nI f the negative value of Ch, is reduced so that the corresponding value o Ch,\' becomes slightly positive, the reversal o force\nf\nf\nmay be eliminated and the force may be brought nearly in phase\nwith the acceleration. There i s a limit to the permissible reduction of the value of Cha, however, because as\napproaches zero\nthe stick force per unit acceleration may become 1ower.for abrupt\nthan for gradual maneuvers and may thus lead to undesirably\nlow stick forces at the beginning of the maneuver.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe stick force per unit normal acceleration as measured\nin steady turns or pull-outs, which was proposed as a criterion of longitudinal handling in reference I , is now generally accepted as a basic measure of longitudinal stability.\nThe critical dependence of this stick-force gradient on elevator hinge-moment parameters and on mass unbalance of\nthe control system was shown in reference 2. It was found\nthat a given stick-force gradient can be obtained by any of a\nseries of combinations of these parameters satisfying certain\nprescribed relations.\nFurther consideration of the problem and some recent\nflight experience, however, have shown the need for investigating the transient effects that occur during the change\nfrom steady unaccelerated flight to steady accelerated fight.\nThese transient effects cause a difference between the stickforce gradients in a steady turn and in a maneuver of short\nduration such as a pull-up.\nThe purpose of the present report is to investigate the\n\n__.\n\nvariation of elevator stick force and normal acceleration\nduring the transition interval preceding the shady turn and\nalso during turns or pull-ups of short duration. The effect\nof combinations of hinge-moment parameters is considered;\neach combination is chosen to give the same stick-force\ngradient in a steady maneuver. Time histories of the stick\nforce and normal acceleration are found for predetermined\nvariations of elevator deflection. An attempt is made to\nexplain and to suggest a remedy for the large variations of\nstick force with time observed during pull-ups cf short duration on different airplanes in flight. A previous analysis,\nsomewhat similar to the present one, was made in England\n(reference 3) but included a smaller range of hinge-moment\nparameters.\nSYMBOLS\n\nA\nb\n\naspect ratio of wing\nwing span\n\n6,\n\nelevator hinge-moment coefficient\n\nC\nL\n\nairplane lit coefficient\n\nC,\n\npitching-moment coefficient about\ncenter of gravity (Pitchm;syment\n\nC\nC,\n\nD\nF\nS\n\nF,,\n\n...\n\n(F)\n\nairplane\n\nwing chord\nelevator chord\ndifferential operator (dJds)\nstick force, pounds\nF5 cases representing particular combinations of\nhinge-moment parameters\nstick-force gradient in maneuvers\nacceleration of gravity\nhinge moment; positive when tends to lower\nelevator\nmass moment of elevator control system about\nelevator hinge; positive when tends to lower\nelevator\nradius of gyration of airplane about Y-axis\ntail length, half-chords\nmass of airplane\nnormal acceleration per g of airplane due to\ncurvature of flight path; accelerometer reading\nminus component of gravity force\ndynamic pressure\nwing area\n\n74lm6-47\n\n337\n\nREPORT NO. 7 9 8-NATIONAL\n\nS*\nS\n\nT\nt\nU\n\nV\nXa.c.\n\na\n!\nffl\n\n6\n\ne\nx\nP\n\nP\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nelevator area\ndistance traveled, half-chords (2Vt/e)\nperiod of elevator motion\ntime\nindependent variable used in Duhamel\xe2\x80\x99s integral\nvelocity\ndistance between center of gravity and aerodynamic center; positive when stable\ndeflection of elevator per unit movement of\nstick, radians per foot\nangle of attack, radians\nangle of attack at tail, radians\ndeflection of elevator; positive downward\nangle of pitch of airplane\nroot of stability equation\nairplane-density parameter (m/pSb)\nmass density of air\n\nSubscript:\nmax\nmaximum\n.Subscripts a!, Da, D2a, ai, DO, 6, and D6 indicate derivatives; for example, C m D o = s .A dot over asymbol indicates\ndifferentiation with respect to time.\n\nC 6 is given as a function of time, the solution for a! is found\nf\nby the method of operational calculus as follows: First a! is\nfound for a unit change in 6.

I n figure 7, the stick force\ncorresponding to Fl (cy. a t maneuver point) is positive at\nfirst and then reverses and becomes negative. The maximum values of the positive and negative forces are approximately equal. As the center of gravity is moved behind the\nmaneuver point for Fl (fig. 8), the negative maximum force\nis greater than the positive; this increase would be expected\nsince a negative force is required to hold the airplane in a\nsteady turn. The stick forces for F3 and F5 remain positrive.\nThe elevator deflection required to produce a given accelerat.ion, however, decreases as the center of gravity moves\nrearward.\nAirplane speed has no effect on the shape of the stickforce and acceleration curves, if compressibdity effects are\nneglected and if the product of speed and duration of maneuver is held constant; for example, the shape of the curves of\nfigures 3 to 5 is unchanged if the speed is halved and the\nduration is doubled. The effect of increasing speed therefore is the same as the effect of increasing duration in the\nsame ratio.\nDISCUSSION\n\nBefore the various elevator cases and degrees of stability\nfor which the computations were made are discussed, i t\nappears desirable to explain the effects of the separate param-\n\n3 40\n\neters that combine to give the resultant elevator forces in\npull-ups. These effects, as already stated, are the variation\nof hinge-moment coefficient with elevator deflection, BS\nindicated by Ch8;\nthe variation of hinge-moment coefficient\nwith angle of attack at the tail, as indicated by Ch+ the\nvariation of hinge moment with angular velocity of the\nelevator about its hinge; the mass unbalance (bobweight\neffect); and the effective moment of inertia of the elevator\nsystem.\nBecause preliminary computations indicated that the\ninertia of the elevator system had a negligible effect on the\nstick force for the shortest maneuver assumed, it was\nneglected in the analysis. For airplanes larger than the one\nconsidered in this report and for other special cases, inertia\nof the elevator systrm may be an important factor.\nThe influence of the important parameters is shown in\nfigure 9, which gives a breakdown of the factors contributing\nto the stick-force curve for case F4in figure 5. Case F4 was\nchosen because it was the only condition in which all the\nparameters were combined.\nFigure 9 shows that the effect of C,, is to produce a component of stick force in phase with elevator deflection. The\nmagnitude of this component of the stick force depends\nsolely on the elevator deflection a t a given speed and is\nindependent of the duration of the maneuver.\n\nEFFECT OF HINGE-MOMENT PARAMETERS ON ELEVATOR STICK FORCES I N RAPID MANEUVERS\n\nFIGURE\nB.-Lines of mnstant stick-Iorw gradient. 6.=0 and 5 pounds prr a.\n\nFIGURE -Stick force and normal acceleration due to rapid elevator motion. T=lsecond:\n5\nV=4M)miles per hour,z, ..=0.075c.\n\nThe normal acceleration produced by the elevator decreases as the duration of the maneuver is made shorter.\nThe stick force per unit acceleration due to the Ch8term\ntherefore increases as the maneuver becomes more rapid.\nThe effect of the mass unbalance of a bobweight is to\ncontribute a component of force that is in phase with and\nsolely dependent on the normal acceleration of the airplane.\nThe stick-force gradient due to the bobweight is therefore\nindependent of duration of maneuver. Although figure 9\ndeals with a mass unbalance that tends to depress the trailing\nedge of the elevator, in the general case the unbalance may\nbe of the opposite sign so that push instead of pull forces\nresult.\nThe effect of C,,., is similar to that of the bobweight since\nthe component of force caused by Chatis nearly in phase\nwith the acceleration. The slight difference in phase between the values of 0 1 ~\nand n is the effect of the rate of change\nof airplane angle of attack. For maneuvers of short duration,\nthis slight phase shift causes a noticeable difference between\nthe action of Chmz of a hobweight.\nand\n\nTime, t, sec\nFIGURE\n7.-Stick force and normal accelerationdue to rapid elevator molion.

T=2 seconds;\nV=400 miles per hour, z o a =O Olc.\n\nThe component of force due to the angular velocity of the\nelevator may be very important for maneuvers of short\nduration. It has the effect of reducing the stick-force\ngradients in cases in which the maximum force occurs after\nthe elevator has reached maximum deflection.\nThe cases for which the results are presented in figures 3 to 5\nwere chosen to show the effects of different combinations\nof the hinge-moment parameters subject to the designer\xe2\x80\x99s\ncontrol. The parameter C,, is the same for all cases. I n\ncase F,, the desired stick force for a steady turn is achieved\nby a balance of relatively large negative values of c h , and\nChar. The stick forces due to these two parameters are in\nopposite directions so that the net value in a steady turn is\ndue to the difference in their effects. In a maneuver of the\ntype shown in figure 1, the elevator-deflection curve leads\nthe normal-acceleration curve; hence c , has the preh\ndominating effect in the initial stages of the maneuver and\nthe negative Cl,et,in the later stages. This fact accounts\nfor the high stick forces in the first half of the maneuver and\nthe reversal of force in the second half for case Fl. The\ndifference is more noticeable in the shorter maneuvers. As\nthe duration of the maneuver decreases, the lag between\n\n342\n\nFIGURE\n9.-Components of stick force for ease F in fimrre5.\nd\n\nairplane motion and elevator deflection becomes greater and\nthe maximum value of the acceleration for the given elevator\ndeflection becomes smaller. Both of these factors tend to\nreduce the importance of the Cha,component in the early\npart of the maneuver and to increase the maximum force\nrequired for a given maximum acceleration. This variation\nof maximum force per unit maximum acceleration shown in\nfigure 10 is quite large.\nFor case F,, the desired stick force for steady turns is\nachieved through the action of Ch,alone. All curves for F2\nwould have the same magnitude for any duration of maneuver\nand would be in phase with the elevator-deflection curve but\nfor the contribution of ChD6-The effect of Ch,, increases\nwith the rapidity of the elevator movement and causes a\nphase shift in the force curve relative to the elevator deflection, which results in a slight increase in the maximum value\nfor the shortest maneuver. A slight push force near the\nend of the maneuver is produced by C,,,. Figure 10 shows\nthat in case F2 the maximum force per unit maximum\nacceleration increases as the maneuver is shortened although\nnot so much as in case F,\nThe balance is achieved in case Fa through action of\n\nEFFECT O F HINGE-MOMENT PARAMETERS O N ELEVATOR STICK FORCES I N RAPID MANEUVERS\nc h a t alone.\nIn this case, the maximum stick force attributed to c h a r is nearly i phase with the acceleration and,\nn\nconsequently, the maximum value occurs after maximum\nelevator deflection when the elevator is being moved back\nto its original position. The forces at the beginning of the\nmaneuver are consequently smaller than in cases Fl and F2\nand may be too small for satisfactory handling qualities.\nThe effect of c h , , is to decrease the maximum force by an\nincreasing amount as the maneuver becomes shorter. The\ndiscontinuity in the F3 curve (and also in the F4 and F5\ncurves) for the 1-second maneuver results from the disappearance of the C,,, component a t the completion of the\nelevator motion. Figure 10 shows that the maximum force\nper unit maximum acceleration for case F3 decreases as the\nmaneuver is shortened; this effect is primarily a result of the\naction of ChDr\n\nfor case Fl, shown in figures 7 and 8, is caused by the greater\nangular response of the airplane to a given elevator deflection that occurs with reduced stability. The greater\nresponse changes the balance between the Ohat\nand c h , components. If the stick force is independent of c h , , as i case\nn\nF3 and Fs, the form of the stick-force curves is unchanged by\nvariation of the center-of-gravity location. Figure 11 shows\nthat the variation of maximum force per unit maximum\nacceleration in a rapid maneuver with center-of-gravity\nlocation becomes less as the value of C,,, is reduced.\nThe adjustment of the elevator parameters so that the\nstick forces for steady turns are directly proportional to the\nnormal acceleration produced and independent of center-ofgravity location is generally conceded to be desirable. It\nappears possible from the analysis to accomplish these conditions by m a k g the stick forces depend primarily on c h , $\nor on a bobweight, provided the entrance and recovery are\nmade slowly. It is not definitely known whether this condition of strict proportionality is desired in maneuvers of\nshort duration.

Computations have\nbeen made for only the 1-second maneuver. The action of\nthe bobweight, as previously mentioned, is similar to that of\nChnfbut for a slight phase shift. The phase shift for a\nmaneuver of short duration is sufficient to reduce the adverse\ninfluence of c h D 6 . This case would show a slightly greater\ndecrease of maximum force per unit maximum acceleration\nthan case FAwith decreased duration of the maneuver.\nThe change of stick force with center-of-gravity location\n\nand recovery are of necessity rapid, strict proportionality\nbetween stick force and acceleration appears impossible\nAccording to figure 10, a\nbecause of the action of c h , , .\nstick-force gradient that is independent of duration of\nmaneuver but varies somewhat with center-of-gravity location can be obtained for a case intermediate between F2 and\nF3. This case would correspond to a certain amount of\nand\nnegative Cn,and positive Ckmf would also result in higher\nstick forces a t the start of the maneuver. A bobweight\nthat increases the stick forces can be substituted for the\npositive cam,.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nA small stick-force gradient in steady turns can be obtained\nwith fairly large negative values of the restoring tendency\nCh, and the floating tendency c h a t , approaching those of an\nunbalanced elevator. Although suitable for slow maneuvers,\nthis combination of parameters leads to a high initial value\nfollowed by a reversal of the stick force in abrupt maneuvers.\nThis dficulty can be avoided and the stick force can be made\n\n343\n\nREPORT NO. 7 9 8-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nto follow closely in phase with the airplane normal1acceleration during both abrupt and slow maneuvers by decreasing\nh and by making ChQI\nslightly positive.\nthe value of c 8\nI Cn, made zero, the stick-force gradient depends entirely\nf\nis\non a positive value of C,,, and is unaffected by the location\nof the airplane center of gravity.

The amplitude of this oscillation is influenced\nby the amount of backlash or \xe2\x80\x9cdead spot\xe2\x80\x9d in the control\nsystem and by the damping of the motion of the airplane.\nIn the following analysis the amplitude and frequency of\nthese oscillations is investigated in terms of the response\ncharacteristics of the airplane.\nANALYSIS\n\nThe aiialysis is based on consideration of the response of\nthe airplane (in terms of angle of yaw or pitch) to a continued\n(unit) signal (fig. 1). This response may be calculated by\nthe ordinary theory of dynamical stability and is conveniently represented in operational form (references 1 and 2) as\nfollows:\nFIGURE\n1.-Typical responw to continued sigual.\n\nThe unit response ordinarily occurs in the form\n\nfrom which is obtained\n\nRl(t)=C(t)+(C,e~lr+Cze~zr+ .)\n..\n(2)\nwhere Clt) is the steady-state motion, Cl and C2 are the\nconstant coefficients of the Heaviside expansion, and XI, Xz,\nand so forth, are the nonzero roots of the characteristic\n\nDuring a hunting oscillation, the automatic steering device\nreverses the signal periodically as the airplane swings through\nthe desired heading. A typical hunting oscillation is shown\nin figure 2. Here it is assumed that the reversal of signal\nis delayed either because of a \xe2\x80\x9cdead spot\xe2\x80\x9d in the steering\ndevice or because of backlash in the control mechanism or a\ncombination of the two. As indicated, the oscillation will\nhave a fundamental period 2 ~ / w(where w is the angular\nfrequency of the hunting oscillation) but may also involve\n\n365\n\nREPORT N O . 80 1-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\ncomponents of higher frequency, depending on the natural\nmodes of oscillation of the airplanc. Ordinarily, the shorterperiod components do not have suEcient amplitude to cause\na reversal of the signal during a half cycle. In these cases\nthe variation of signal with time will be represented by a\nsimple \xe2\x80\x9csquare wave,\xe2\x80\x9d which niay be expressed as a function\nof time by\n(3)\n\ndead spot. With the frequency determined, it is possible\nalso to find the amplitude of the oscillation and the maximum\ndeviation of the airplane from its path.\nIn the simplest cases the required information may be\nobtained directly from equation ( 6 ) . In the case of more\ncomplex motions, further analysis will be required a follows:\ns\nAs a first step, separate B l ( i n w ) into its real and imaginary\nparts\nW l ( i n w )=A(no)+ i ~ ( n w )\n\nor, more convekently, by the imaginary part of the corresponding exponential series; that is,\n\nThe functions A and R may be plotted against n w as in\nfigure 3.

It w l also be possible to\nestablish, in these ranges, a correspondence between the frequency of the hunting oscillation and the magnitude of the\n\n366\n\n(7)\n\nn?\n\n.\n\nThis amplitude will also be the amplitude of the dead spot.\n(See fig. 2.)

A further condition is that no more than\none complete crossing of the dead spot occurs within onehalf cycle; that is,\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nIn order to demonstrate and check the procedure described,\nassume a simple response characteristic in which the airplane immediately starts turning at a constant rate, as\ndirected by the signal.

At speeds above the speed\nof sound, application of the same assumptions leads to the\nArkeret theory (reference 4) according to which the wing\nsrctions generate plane sound waves of small amplitude.\nAs is wdl known, the Ackeret theory predicts a radical change\nin tho properties of such wings on transition to supersonic\nvdocities and these changes have been verified by exprriments in supersonic wind tunnels (reference 5 ) .\nBoth the Avk(,ret theory and the Munk theory apply to\nllic casr of a wing having a large span and a small chord.\nThe present discussion is based on assumptions similar to\nthose used by Adicrcit a n d hiunk but covers the opposite\nextreme, namely, the* wing of small span and large chord.\nIn the latter case the flow is expected to be two dimensional\nwhen viewed in planrs prrpendicular to the direction of\nmotion.\nA theory for tlrc rectangular wing of small aspert ratio\nhas been given by Bollay ( i r f ( w i w c ~\n6).

With this idealization, the treatment of the low-aspect-ratio airfoil becomes\nexceedingly simple; formulas are obtained that are similar\nin some respects to those derived by Munk (reference 8)\nand Tsien (reference 7) for an elongated body of revolution.\nPerhaps the simplest case from the analytical point of\nview is that of the long, flat, triangular airfoil traveling\npoint-foremost a t a small angle of attack. Viewed from a\nreference system at rest in the undisturbed fluid, the flow\npattern in a plane cutting the airfoil a t a distance x from\nthe nose is the familiar turo-dimensional flow caused by a\nflat plate having the normal velocity Va. (See fig. 1.)\nObserved in this plane, the width of the plate and hence the\nscale of the flow pattern continually increase as the airfoil\nprogresses through the plane. This increase in the scale\nof the flow pattern requires a local lift force I equal to the\ndownward velocity Va times the local rate of increase of\n\'\nthe additional apparent mass m , or\n\ndm\'\ndx\n\n=p f f -\n\nwell-known formula from two-dimensional-flow\nb2\nm\'=r-p dx\n4\n\nwhere b is the local width of the plate.\n\nHence\n\ndm\' db\n_ -r 2bp d x dX\ndx\n\nI per length dx will be given by the expression\nl=ra\n\nDividing by\ncoefficient\n\nb\nX\n\ndb\n\n= 2 p v bb dx\n--\n\nwhere b+/bb is a function of y.\nthe equation\n\nor\np\n\n(3)\n\nDifferentiation of 4 yields\n\n201 db\nsinedx\n\n(4)\n\n)\n\nsince\n\nand the lift\n\n= 2 p v d4J\n-\n\nThe pressure distribution thus shows an infinite peak along\nthe sloping sides of the airfoil similar to the pressure peak\na t the leading edge of a conventional airfoil. The distribution along radial lines passing through the vertex of the\n\ndm\'\nl=Vffdt\n\nBy\ntheory,\n\nupper to the lower surface of the airfoil. (See fig. 2 . ) An\ninstant later, in the same plane, the ordinates are those of a\nslightly larger ellipse, corresponding to an increase of 4. The\nlocal pressure difference is given by the local rate of increase\nof +, that is,\n\nf V 2 bdb dx\ndx\n\n4V 2and by t,he area b dx gives the local lift\n\ntriangle (lines of constant 1J is unifcrm (fig. 3), however,\nbI2\nand the center of pressure coincides with the center of area.\nEquations (1) and (4)show that the development of lift\nby the long slender airfoil depends on an expansion of thr\nsections in a downstream direction; hence a part of the\nsurface having parallel sides would develop no lift. Furthermore, a decreasing width would, according to equation (4),\nrequire negative lift with infinite negative pressure peaks\nalong the edges of the narrower sections. I n the actualflow,\nhowever, the edge behind the maximum cross section will\nlie in the viscous or turbulent wake formed over the surface\nahead; and for this reason it will be assumed that the infinite\npressure difference indicated by equation (3) cannot be developed across these edges. It is this assumption, corresponding to the Kutta condition, which gives the plate the\nproperties of an airfoil as distinct from another type of\nbody, such as a body of revolution.\n\nt"\n\ndb\ne,=rff dx\nWhen this flow is considered in more detail, it is found from\nthe two-dimensional theory that the surface potential rp is\ndistributed spanwise according to the ordinates of an ellipse,\nthat is,\n4J= f vffJ($Y-\n\n= f V a Zbs i n e\n\ny\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere cos 6 =-Y and the sign changes in going from the\nbl2\n\n372\n\nFIGURE l.-Flow patf2rn.\n\nFIGURE\nz.-Potential.\n\nPROPERTIES OF LOW-ASPECT-RATIO POINTED WINGS\n\nWith the aid of the Kutta condition, it may easily be\nshown that sections of the airfoil behind the section of greatest\nwidth develop no lift. A potential flow satisfying both the\nboundary condition and the Kutta condition may be obtained\nby the introduction of a free surface of discontinuity behind\nthe widest section. This surface of discontinuity (fig. 4)\nwould be composed of parallel vortices extending downstream from the widest section of the airfoil as prolongations\nof the vortices representing the discontinuity of potential\nover the forward part of the airfoil. This sheet, although\npossibly wider than the downstream sections of the airfoil,\nstill satisfies their boundary condition, since the lateral\narrangement of the vortices is such as to give uniform\ndownward velocity equal to J7a over the entire width of the\nsheet including the rearward portion of the airfoil. Since\nthe pressure difference across the airfoil is proportional to\nb+/bx and since this gradient disappears as soon as the\nvortices hecome parallel to the stream, no lift is developed\non the rearward sections.\nIntegration of the pressures in a chordwise direction from\nthe leading edge downstream to the widest section will give\nthe span load distribution and the induced drag. The span\nload distribution is\n\nor, from equation (31,\n\n~\n\nbL =2p\n\n~~\n\nFrom equation ( 2 ) ,\n\nhY\n\n+=\n\nVU\n\n\'22\n\n2\n\nv+\nsin\n\nr SPEEDS BELOW AND ABOVE THE SPEED OF SOUND\n\nThe lift of the slender airfoil therefore depends only on the\n1\n\nwidth and not on the area.

I the rate of increase of the width\nbecomes too great, the flow cannot beiexpected to remain\ntwo dimensional. It can be shown by examination of the\nknown three-dimensional (nonlifting) potential flow around\nan clliptic disk (reference 9), however, that the twodimensional theory gives a good approximation in the case\nof an elliptical leading edge, which indicates that the theory\n\ne\n\nHence bI&y is elliptical and independent of the plan form.\nWith the elliptical span load the induced drag is a minimum\nand is equal to\n\ndL\n\nA second integration of\n\n--\n\nbY\n\ndy across the widest section\n\ngives the total lift, which is\n\n"=&\n\n7r\n\nAspect ratio, A\nFIGURE\n5.-Comparison oi lilt calculate&by present theory for elliptical wings oi low aspecl\nratio with results of Krienes (reference 10).\n\npv2ff!l,na22\n\n(6)\n\nis applicable over a large range of nose shapes.

The correct\ndimensions and correct distribution of +-are then obtained\nwhen the transformation is applied.\nFor the long slender airfoil, the potential distribution a t\neach section is similar to that for an infinitely long body;\ntherefore d+/dx and hence the local pressures vary in inverse\nproportion to the length. The foregoing calculation procedure gives a null result in this case, since the pressures\ncalculated for the fictitious airfoil at M=O will be reduced\nin the same ratio that the length is increased and the Lorentz\ntransformation to restore the correct length will also restore\nthe same pressures as those obtained a t M=O. Since\nb+/dz is unchanged by the transformation, the normal\nvelocity component and hence the angle of attack are unchanged also. These results can be obtained by referring\ndirectly to the linearized equation for the potential\n\nMach cone (fig. 7). The condition of a small vertex angle is\nalso necessary in order that the potential distribution of\nequation (2) may apply. In the case of a wing with a bluntleading-edge plan form, abrupt changes in the flow arise on\ntransition to supersonic velocities, and potential flow of the\nsubsonic type no longer exists.\nThe lift and lift distribution for rectangular surfaces a t\nsupersonic speeds have been calculated by Schlichting (reforence 11). Figure 7 shows the variation of lift-curve slopc\nwith Mach number as obtained from Schlichting\'s results for\nrectangular wings of two different aspect ratios and for the\nrange of speeds in which the two Mach cones from the tips\ndo not reach the center of the wing. I n t.he subsonic r n g e ,\nvalues given by the Prandtl-Glauert rule are shown. These\ncurves are compared with the values indicated by the present\ntheory for a triangular wing lying near the center of the\nMach cone. Figure 8 shows the travel of the center of pressure for these plan forms. It is to be noted that, with the\nblunt-leading-edge plan forms, the center of pressure travels\nfrom a point near thc quarter chord to a point near the midchord when the velocity is increased above the speed of\nsound.\n\nMach number, ill\nFIGURE\n\'i.-Varintion of lift with Mnch numher for ciiflrrrnt 111.mfrrins.\n\n(See reference 3.) If the airfoil is sufficiently slender,\nd2+/dx2can be neglected in comparison with d+/dr except\nnear the edge. Since the lift is proportional to d+/dx, the\nincrease of the lift with Mach number can therefore be\nneglected in comparison with the lift.\nIt is important to note that the theory of small disturbances is not limited to subsonic velocities and that, so long\nas the term ( 1 - M 2 ) 3%in equation (9) remains small, the\nsolution in the region of the wing will continue to be given\nby the potential (equation (2)). Evidently the Mach number cannot be increased indefinitely, for then the coefficient\nwill become so large that the first term will no longer\nof d2+/dx2\nbe negligible. The required condition will be satisfied, however, by adopting a pointed plan form with the vertex angle\nso small that the entire surface lies near the center of thc\n\n3 74\n\n*\n\n(t\n\n0"\n%\n\n6\n\n50\n\n9\n\n2\nI\n\'@O\n\nI\n\nI \'\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI I\n\n\'\'\'\' \'\nI\n\nLO\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n20\nMach number, A4\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n30\n\nFIGURE\nR.-\'i\'rnvrl of wnter 01 pressure with Mach uumbrr Inr dificrrnt plan forms.\n\nPROPERTIES OF LOW-ASPECT-BAT10 POINI\'ED WINGS AT SPEEDS BELOW AND ABOVE THE SPEED OF SOUND\n\nTESTS OF A TRIANGULAR AIRFOIL AT SUPERSONIC SPEED\n\n8.

This principle m a y also be applied to w\xe2\x80\x99ngs designed\n-fnr subsonic speeds near the speed qf sound,.for which the induced\nm the thickness tniaht ofhe\nra!ocities result\nciently great to\nshock waves.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe theory of potential flows with small disturbances is\nparticularly suit,ed for application to aeronautiral problems\nbecause the assumptions of small disturbances and isentropic flows on which this theory is bawd agree with tlic\nrequirements for efficient flight. Theories of large disturbances, which deal with tlic formation of shock waves, are of\nlesser practical interest since surh theories describe the losses\nof energy and the large drags assoriatsd with unsuitable\nforms.\nAt subsonic speeds the assumption of small disturbances\nleads to the well-known thin-airfoil theory and the PrandtlGlauert rule (references 1 and 2) ; whereas a t supersonic\nvelocities this assumption leads to the Ackeret theory\n(reference 3), according to which the wing sections generate\nplane sound waves of small amplitude. The assumption of\nsmall disturbances, although mathematically valid in the\nlimiting case, does not, of course, insure that such a condition\nwill exist with an actual body of finite thickness. Fortunately, experiments have been made that show in a general\nway the limits of applicability of this assumption. Of particular interest are the experiments of Ferri (reference 4) and\nStanton (reference 5 ) .\nAt. present both the experiments and the theory have\nbren restricted primarily to the two-dimensional flow caused\nby motion of the wing at right angles to its long axis. For\nthis case the theory shows a radical change in the properties\n\nJONW\n\nof tlic wing on transition from subsonic to supcrsonic speeds.\nA t subsonic speeds the air flows smoothly over the wing scction and no pressure drag arises. At angles of attack a\nsuction forcc is developed on the nose of the airfoil of sufficient magnitude to bring the resultant air force forward\nrelative to the chord axis to a position nearly a t right angles\nto the rcllativc wind. As soon as the speed of sound is\nrsccetled, howevrr, the nature of the flow changes and these\nfavorablc characteristics disappear. Instead there arise a\npressure drag proportional to the squarc of the thickness and\nan additional drag equal to the lift times the angle of attack.\nThese adverse effects are associated with the formation of\nplane sound waves by the airfoil. Predictions of the theory\narc borne out by experiments in supersonic wind tunnels.\nThe purpose of the present report i,s to show how thc\nadverse effects of high speed may be minimized by the use\nof a relatively large angle of sweepback, so that the type of\nflow described in tlic Arlwret theory no longer occurs. Certain cffects of sweepback have, of course, been known for\nsomc time (refcrences 6 to 9). Kussner (reference 8) mentions compressibility effects of sweepback a t subsonic\nspeeds. Busemann (reference 9) considers the effect of\nsweepback a t supersonic speeds and points out that the\ndrag associated with flows of the Ackeret type may be reduced by the use of sweepback. Busemann does not,\nhowever, consider angles of sweepback greater than the\nMach angle, which rcsult in a different type of flow.\nSYMBOLS\n\nangle of attack\nangle of sideslip or sweepback\nvelocity components along T , y ,\ncoordinates\ntransformed coordinate\nwing span\nwing chord; velocity of sound\nthickness\nvelocity of flight\ndisturbance-velocity potential\nlift\ndrag\nlift coefficient\ndrag coefficient\nMach number\nlocal pressure difference\ndynamic pressure\n\nc\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nspanwise-location parameter\n\n816587- -49\n\n379\n\nREPORT NO. 8 63-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nTHEORY OF WING AT AN ANGLE OF SIDESLIP\n\nThe primary effects of sweepback may be illustrated by\nconsidering the problem of a long and approximately cylindrical airfoil a t an angle of sideslip. Two such airfoils may\nthen be combined (with due allowance for their interference)\nto give a sweptback plan form.\nFirst consider the airfoil with its long axis parallel to the\nx-axis and with the relative wind at an angle P. to the coordinate system as in figure 1. By following equation (sa) of\nreference 2 the differential equation of the flow may be\nwritten\n\nThe Prandtl-Glauert rule follows from the assumption\nthat only the velocity component u is comparable to the\nvelocity of sound. I n the present example both u and v,\nsince they contain components of the flight velocity, are of\nthe order of magnitude of the sound velociiy c. On the\nother hand, if the flow patterns in planes perpendicular to\nthe long axis of the wing are similar (two-dimensional flow),\nthe terms buldx and bvlbx vanish.\nIf small velocity disturbances are assumed, the term w/c\nmay be neglected and the term\n\n1..,\n---vcos /9\n\nFIGURE\nl.-Plac\n\n380\n\n212\n1-2\n\n1\n\n-\n\nv (cos~p\n\n) where V cos\n\n0 is the component of the flight\n\nvelocity in the direction normal to the long axis of the wing.\nBy using this relation and introducing the disturbance potential (6, there is obtained\n\nIt is important to note that, the derivation of this equation\ninvolves no restriction on the flight ve1ocit.y V , which may\nbe subsonic or supersonic. The restriction is that the disturbance velocities b+/by and 34/bz be small relative to c.\nIf Vcos p is less than the sound velocity c, the substitution\n\nyields Laplace\xe2\x80\x99s equation\n\nand it follows that the flow patterns are similar to those\noccurring in an incompressible fluid except for an increase\nof the pressures in t,he ratio\n\nmay be replaced by\n\nI V cos p is greater than e, the substitution\nf\ny \xe2\x80\x99=\n\ns\n\nview of airfoil showing axes used in equation (1).\n\nY\n\nv cos p\n\n(5)\n\nresults in the hyperbolic equation\n\nwhich is the basis of the Ackeret theory.\nThe derivation of equations (4)and (6) is actually a special\ncase of a more general statement, namely, that the component\nof translation of a cylindrical body in the direction of its long\naxis has no effect on the motion of a frirtionless fluid. In\nthe case of a wing of constant section moving through still\nfluid, the flow is determined by the normal components of\nvelocity of its solid boundaries and these components in turn\nare completely specified by the component of motion in\nplanes perpendicular to the axis V cos 0. When the normal\ncomponent of velocity V cos 0 is less than sonic, then the\nwing-section flows are determined by solutions of Laplace\xe2\x80\x99s\nequation. As is well known, these flows show no pressure\ndrag due to thickness of the airfoil. On the other hand, if\nthe normal component exceeds the velocity of sound, the\nflow patterns are of a different type and are characterized by\nplane sound s-aves. In this case a pressure drag arises and\nthe suction for-? at the leading edge disappears (fig. 2 (a)).\n\nWING PLAN FORMS FOR HIGH-SPEED FLIGHT\n\n(n) I - r m B > E .\n\nPlan view\n\n(h) V c o s B < c\nFIGURE\n?.--Eff~ct01 leadingedge angle on pressure distrihntion.\n\nA physical explanation of tlic occurrence of smooth flow\npatterns and pressure distributions at supersonic velocities\nis as follows: If V is greater than c but V cos 0 is less, then\nthe angle of sideslip or sweepback is greater than the Mach\nangle (see fig. 2 (b)) and the airfoil will lie behind the characteristic lines along which pressure influences arc transmitted\n(Mac11 lines). Thus, although tlic fluid dircrtly upstream\nfrom a given section can rewivc no pressurc signal from this\nsection. the flow behaves as though it did receive such signals\nbecause of the successive influenc3eof similar sections farther\nupstream along the airfoil. The streamlines will thus be\ncaused to curve and follow paths appropriate to a subsonic\nflaw, although the speed is everywhere supersonic.\nFigure 3 illustrates the effect of sweepback on the change\nin cross section of a stream tube passing near the upper surface of a cambered airfoil. As is well known, the equations\nof fluid motion show a reduction in the area of a stream tube\nin the region of increased velocity above the airfoil when the\nvelocity of flight is subsonic but show an increase in the\nrross section when the velocity of flight is supersonic. In\nfigure 3 the component normal to the leading edge T\' cos 0\nis subsonic; and hence in section view the strcumlincs, following the pattern for subsonic velocities, appear to contract as\nthey flow over the upprr surfacse. I n plan view, however,\nthe resolution of velocities shows that the flow lines bend RF\n\nSection view\nFIGCRB\n3.-Chdngc in area of stream tube over upper surfnee ofsweptback wing.\n\nthey pass over the wing in such a way as to increase the\nstream-tubc area. In case the velocity of flight is supersonic, the latter effect must predominate, as is required by\nthe equations of motion. \'\nThe order of magnitude of the pressure-drag coefficient.\nand its variation with angle of sweepback are indicated by\nfigure 4. The calculations were made by applying the\nAckeret theory and formulas (4)and (5) to a wing of infinite\naspect ratio. A simple biconvex wing section was assumed\nand the angle of attack was varied so as to maintain a constant lift coeffcient of 0.5. The calculations were made for\na Mach number of 1.4,with the result that a t 45" the angle\nof sweepback becomes equal to the Mach angle and the\nfactor\n\nbecomes infinite. At this point the pressure drag due to\ntliirkncss becomes infinite and the drag due to angle of\nt\nattack (shown by the curve marked z=O) vanishes.\n\n381\n\nREPORT NO. 86 3-NATIONAL\n\nADVISOXY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\ni\n\nSection\n\nstaggering the elements in a rearward direction behind the\nMach lines as in figure 5 .

If the wing is\nof sufficiently high aspect ratio, however, the fraction of the\nwing area affected will bc negligible and thc pressiirc drag\nwill be nearly that given in figure 4. The other drags involved are: (1) skin-friction drag, which may be of the\norder of 0.01, and (2) induced drag, which for an aspect ratio\nof 8 is also about 0.01.\nWINGS OF FINITE SPAN AND THICKNESS\n\nSchlichting (reference 10) proposes a trapezoidal plan form\nwith tips cut away a t the Mach angle as the ideal supersonic\nwing, since in this case the wake has no influence on the lifting\nsurface and the drag is no greater than that of a wing of infinite\nspan. In the plan forms proposed by Srhlichting, however,\nthe resultant forcr remains a t right angles to the chord ;hence\nthe pressure drag is equal to the lift tinies the angle of attack.\nWith this type of flow thrre is 110 fnvorablr effect of aspect\nratio.\nIt is interesting to note that a favorable interferrnce may be\nobtained by separating the wing into lifting elements and\n\n382\n\nof clement B, caused by moving it into a position of greater\nupwash (that is, moving it backward relative to A), would be\ncompensated by an equal increasr in the drag of olcment A,\nrrsulting from tho loss of upwash a t A. (Sec fig. 5.) I n\nsupersonic flow, however, this rcciprocd relation clocs not\nexist since a lifting clement can produc~~ upwash ahcntl of\nno\nits Mach cone. lifting elements sparrd a t right angles to thr\ndirection of fliglit therrforc have no favorable intrrfrrenw,\nand it is evident that the lift-drag ratio (miriot lw improved\nmerely by increasing the aspect ratio of tlic lifting systrm.\nFavorable intrrferencc can be obtained only by arranging thr.\nlifting elements brliintl tbc Mach lines, as shown in figurr 5.\nFurther analysis is needed to determine the flow near thc\ncenter section of thc swcptback wing bccaiise in this region\nthe flow will not remain two-dimensional, as has twrn assumed. Departures from cylindrical flow rausctl by tlir tips\nwill be small since their influence cannot extend forward of\nthe Mach lines drawn from the points a t which thrse dcpartures originate in the plan form.

Some insight into the problem of flow near the center section may bc furnished by thc known solutions for\nsupersonic flow in three dimensions (reference 13). Finite\nthickness may also cause pressure drag in regions where the\nHow is two-dimensional if the induced velocities are great\nenough to cause shock waves. This effect may be avoided\nby increasing the angle of sweepback so that the normal\ncomponent of velocity not only is subsonic but is less than\nthe critical speed of the airfoil sections. This principle may\nalso be applied to wings designed for subsonic speeds near\nthe speed of sound.\n\nSec fion A -A\n\n2\na\nsin\n\ndb\n\ne\n\ndo\n\n-_AP\n9\n\nSection 6-6\n\nL.4NGLEY MEMORIAL\nAERONAUTICAL\nLABORATORY,\nNATIONAL\nADVISORY\nCOMMITTEE AERONAUTICS,\nFOR\nVA.,\nLANGLEY FIELD, June 23, 1945.\nREFERENCES\n\nE.: The Effect of Compressibility 011 the Lift of ai) Aerofoil.

The\nresults for the three bodies are shown in figures 3, 4 , and 5,\nrespectively, and are compared with the theoretical pressure\ndistributions over these bodies in an incompressible fluid. A\ndiscussion of the errors involved in the linear theory and the\nvariation of the pressures with Mach number will be found in\nreference 3.\nComparison of the distributions in a compressible fluid and\nin an incompressible fluid shows a certain similarity, especially\ntoward the rear of the body. The effect of supersonic speed\nappears to be similar to the effect of a lag inasmuch as the\nnegative pressure peak and the region of pressure recovery are\ndisplaced rearward. The pressures along the axis behind the body\nare just twice those produced by an incompressible fluid, as may\nbe seen by referring to the velocity field of a single source.\nThe results obtained herein for the three-dimensional body\nare in marked contrast to the results obtained for two-dimensional\nbodies, or wing sections, having similar cross sections. As is\nwell known, in the two-dimensional case no pressure recovery\ntakes place at supersonic speeds, the pressure at a point being\ndetermined solely by the inclination of the surface at that point\nso that positive pressures occur wherever the cross section is\nexpanding and negative pressures occur wherever the cross\nsection is diminishing. Figure 6 shows the comparison of the\ntwo-dimensional and three-dimensional bodies for the 0.10\nthickness ratio.\nThe essential difference between the two- and threedimensional flows corresponds to the difference noted by Lamb\n(reference 4 ) between the characteristics of a plane sound wave\nand an axially symmetrical wave diverging from a center. As\nnoted by Lamb, the plane wave, which corresponds in the present\ncase to the flow produced by the two-dimensional wing section,\nis propagated indefinitely without change of form; whereas the\naxially symmetrical wave, which approximates that produced by an\nelement of the slender body of revolution, does not follow the\nform of the disturbing motion but leaves a "tail" of diminishing\nintensity and indefinite extent. Thus the wing section leaves\nno pressure disturbance in its wake, whereas the axially\nsymmetrical body is followed by an indefinite region of positive\npressure.

The cases considered thus j a r are\nsymmetrical airfoils at zero lijt hawing plan forms bounded by\nstraight lines. Because o the conical f o r m o the elementary\nf\nf\nflow jields, the results are comparable in simplicity to the\nresults o the two-dimensional thin-airfoil theory f o r subsonic\nf\nspeeds.\nIn the case o untapered airfoils swept back behind the\nf\nMach cone the pressure distribution at the center section is\nsimilar to that given by the Ackeret theory for a straight airfoil.\nW i t h increasing distance f r o m the center section the distribution\napproaches the .form given by the subsonic-$ow theory. The\npressure drag i s concentrated chiefly at the center section and\nor long wings a slight negative drag m a y appear on outboard\nsections.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn reference 1 it was pointed out that the wave drag of\nan infinite cylindrical airfoil disappears when the airfoil is\nyawed to an angle greater than the Mach angle. This\nobservation led to the conclusion that the drag of a finite\nairfoil could be greatly reduced by the use of sufficient\nsweepback. With such a sweptback wing the wa-i-e drag\nwould be associated with departures from the ideal twodimensional flow a t the root or tip sections and would thus\nbe a function of the aspect ratio. The present report extends\nthe theory of reference 1 to take account of these efl\xe2\x80\x99ects.\nThe treatment is based on the theory of small disturbances\nin a frictionless compressible fluid. The idealized fluid and\nits equations of motion are identical with those employed in\nacoustics in the theory of sound waves of small amplitude.\nThe application of the theory is thus limited to bodies having\nthin cross sections so that the velocity of motion imparted\nto the fluid is small relative to the velocity of sound and so\nthat the pressure disturbances produced are small relative\nto the ambieht pressure.\nThe adaptation of the sound-wave theory to the aerodynamics of moving bodies was suggested many years ago\nby Prandtl. The theory was applied by Ackeret (reference2)\nto thin airfoils moving at supersonic speed. Ackeret\xe2\x80\x99s\ntreatment. is limited, however, to infinitely long cylindrical\nairfoils moving transversely. The present theory may be\nconsidered an extension of Ackeret\xe2\x80\x99s theory to take into\n\naccount wings of finite span and wings having tapered or\nsweptback plan forms. In the case of sweptback plan forms\nthe results are markedly different from those obtained by\nthe Ackeret theory and approach. the values indicated in\nreferences 1 and 3.\nIn reference 4 Busemann describes a method for calculating the supersonic flow over bodies which produce a\nconical pressure field. Busemann shows that the flow\naround cones of circular cross sections as well as the flow\naround the tip of a rectangular lifting surface satisfies\nthis condition. The fact that a great variety of threedimensional flows can be constructed by the superposition of\nconical and cylindrical flow fields leads to an essential simplification of the airfoil theory a t supersonic speeds.\nThe present treatment differs from Busemann\xe2\x80\x99s in that it is\nfurther limited to flat bodies, that is, bodies which are thin\nin both longitudinal and transverse sections. This additional restriction leads to a much simpler mathematical\ntreatment and one which is applicable to a wide variety of\nairfoil shapes. Symmetrical nonlifting bodies arc also\ntreated in reference 5 where use is made of integral expressions corresponding to the velocity potential of plane-source\ndistribution.\nSYMBOLS\n\nV\nA\n4\n\nflight velocity\nMach number ,\nx , y , z coordinates\npoint on X-axis\nE\nzI\nlimit of integration\ndisturbance-velocity potential\nu, c, w disturbance-velocity components\nvalue of u at zz\nuz\nu\nvalue of u for conjugate arrangement\np\nlocal pressure\ndynamic pressure -pV\n4\nP\ndensity of air\nP,, Qn Legendre functions\nI\nsource-strength factor\nD\ndifferential operator\nC\n,\ndrag coefficient\nt\nthickness of wing\nslope of line source (absolute value)\nm\nC\nchord of wing\nC\n#\nJ\n\nG 9\n\n79524949\n\n405\n\nREPORT NO. 8 5 1-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nTHE OBLIQUE LINE SOURCE\n\nThe assumptions of small disturbances and a constant\nvelocity of sound throughout the fluid lead to the wellknown linearized equation for the velocity potential $ (see\nreference 6)\n(1 --2Gf2)$*,+\n\n$uvS$**=O\n\n(1)\n\nthe other components may be obtained by integrating the\ngiven component to obtain the velocity potential and then\ndifferentiating the results along the desired directions to obtain the desired components. This procedure is especially\nuseful in the thin-airfoil theory, where the complete velocity\nfield may not be required.\nAdopting the foregoing procedure, one may write\n\nThe analysis is simplified by introducing the coordinates\nx1=x\n\n--I\n\n\\\n\nyl= JM2-1 y\n%= -1\nJ 2\nM\n\nDropping the subscripts from the transformed coordinates\ngives\n$zz-#Jvv+,z=\n0\n(3)\nAccording to the thin-airfoil theory the pressures on the\ntransformed airfoil are given by\n\nS i c e u is proportional to the pressure, such a solution corresponds to a point source in the pressure field. The\nsolution for an oblique line source may be obtained by\nintegrating for the effect of a row of point sources along the\nline y = mx. It will be shown that such a line source satisfies\nthe boundary condition for a thin wedge-shape body. This\nsolution, as well as other expressions relating to oblique airfoils, can be most conveniently expressed by referring to the\noblique coordinates\nz\'= x- my\ny\' =y -mx\n~\n\nz\'= J1 -m2 z\n\nand the slope of the airfoil surface\n\ndz\n\n(See fig. 1.)

(See\nreference 6 for the derivation of these elementary solutions.)\nBecause of the linearity of equation (1) a solution may be\nused to denote one of the velocity components rather than\nthe velocity potential. The specification of one component\nin this manner actually describes the whole flow field since\n\n406\n\nFIQUBE\n1.-Obliquo raardinatcs.\nd=z-my\nY\'=fl-N\nt\'=\n\n2\n\n1\n\nT H I S OBLIQUE AIRFOILS AT SUPERSOXIC SPEED\n\nIIcncr the iiitcbgration for tlie effect of an inclined line of\nsources may br pcrformcd tlircctly along the oblique 2\xe2\x80\x98-asis;\nthus, for m<1.0\n\nwhere\nis the position of tlie last source whose Mach cone\nincIutIes the point (TI,y\xe2\x80\x99, 2\xe2\x80\x99) anti is given by\nX\n\nWhen m approaches 1 .O the source line approaches coincidence with the RIach cone, corresponding to a transverse\nvelocity component equal to the velocity of sound.\nFor values of m greater than 1.0 the integration yields\n\nI t will be seen that in this case Z is imaginary.\nThe vertical velocity near z=O, which determines the\nshape of the boundary, may be determined by integrating u\nwith respect to r and then differentiating the resulting\nvelocity potential with respect to z ; thus (see appendix),\n\nFIGC Z.--Pic~sure field for oblique wedge where m<1.0.*-+.\nRE\n\na=cosh-l z--?ny\n\nlv-wl\n\n&=eosh-l z+my\nIUfn=l\n\nwhere Iy\xe2\x80\x99 I denotes the absolute magnitude of y\xe2\x80\x99=y-mx.\nThe pressure is thus constant along the radial lines\ndx\n\n=-su\nb\n\n2\xe2\x80\x99\n\n--Constant\nY \xe2\x80\x99\n\nbz\n=fn\n\nI\nm ,\xe2\x80\x98l--mz\n\nif z+O and y\xe2\x80\x99<O.\nIf y\xe2\x80\x98>O, w=O.

For small values of I / m this\ndiscontinuity in vertical velocity agrees with the boundary\ncondition for a simple wedge shape having a small wedge\nangle. (See fig. 2.)\nIf the source strength I is held constant and m is allowed\nto approach zero, the wedge angle ultimately becomes large.\nAt m=O the line source actually satisfies the boundary condition for the circular cone (reference 7), but it is found that\nthe slope of the conical boundary does not agree with the\nslope of the streamlines near z=O and hence the theory no\nm\nlonger holds. The condition -+O thus represents the transi-\n\n(1 0)\n\nand is conveniently represented by the variation along a line\nparallel to the X-axis.

(Actually, of course, the thin-airfoil\ntheory shows an infinite velocity a t such points, but this is\nto be interpreted as a velocity of the order of magnitude of\nthe flight velocity V. The pressure to be expected along the\nleading edge is the stagnation pressure corresponding to the\ntramverse velocity component.)\ndz w\nGiven -=-, the wedge angle measured in downstream\ndx V\nsections, the source strength must vary with m according to\n\nI\n\ntion from an oblique airfoil to a body of revolution and will\nbe avoided in the present analysis by restricting the formulas\nto flat bodies, that is, airfoils that are thin in both longitudinal\nand transverse section.\n\n(from equation (7)).

Since the\nsubsonic type of distribution shows no pressure drag, there\nis a continuous falling off of the pressure drag with increasing\ndistance from the root section. The pressure drag of the\noblique wing thus arises chiefly on the foremost section, and\nit. follows that the drag coefficient of the wing as a whole\ndiminishes with inereasing aspect ratio. It will be shown\nsubsequently that the effect of cutting the wing off along a\nline y=Constant to produce a downstream tip causes a\nrcduction of the pressure drag on the adjacent sections; and\nif the aspect ratio is sufficiently high, the pressure drag in\nthe region of the downstream tip may actually be negative.\nIf the wing lies ahead of the Mach lines (m>l.O) the\nSckeret type of pressure distribution occurs and a pressure\ndrag arises over the wholc length. In this case both u and w\nare constant over the bcvcled part a t a distance from the origin.\nI\n\nSiniilarly if P.(F) d \xe2\x82\xac is taken as the chordwise distribution of vorticity,\nZL\n\n0-\n\nP" (2)\n\nw a Q" (Z)\n\ndz\n\nm-\n\ndz\n\nThe first of this series of airfoils is the camber shape curved to support a iiuiiorm load.\n\nThe treatment thus far applies to semi-infinite cylindrical\nwings having root sections near the origin. A complete\nsweptback wing may be obtained by the addition of a symmetrical or conjugate arrangement of source lines below the\nX-axis. Values of u for this conjugate arrangement may be\ndenoted by E. Figures 2 and 3 show \'i for a single inclined\ni\nsource and figure 5 shows calculated pressure distributions\na t several sections along the span for a complete sweptback\nairfoil having beveled sections. The addition of the conjugate source lines doubles the pressure a t the root section,\nbut this interference effect falls off rapidly along the span.\nIt is noted that, as in figure 4, the most significant change\nin pressure distribution occurs along the expansion wave\noriginating a t the trailing edge of the root section.

JONES\nT\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA previozls report gave calcdutions for the pressure distribution ocer thin oblique airfoils at supersonic speed. The\npesent report extends the calcukations to subsonic speeds.\nIt is-found that theJEowsagain can be obtained by the superposition of elemenday conicalJfowJields. I n the case o the\nf\nswept-back wing the pressure distributions remain qualitatively\nsimilar a subsonic and supersonic speeds. ZJmsa distribution\nt\nsimilar to the Aekeret type of distribution appears on the root\nsections of the swept-back wing a\xe2\x82\xac M=O. The resulting positive pressure drag on the root section is balanced by negative\ndrags on outboard sections.\n\nIn general, the present development follows closely that of\nreference 1 and the reader should consult that report for\nadditional details of the method. The solutions are given\nexplicitly for M=O but are extended to other Mach numbers\nby the well-known Pranatl transformation.\nTHE OBLIQUE LINE SOURCE\n\nIt is well known that an individual velocity component of a\npotential flow will satisfy the same differential equation as tlir\npotential. In the approximation of the thin-airfoil theory\nt,he pressure depends only on the individual componrnt u,\nthat is,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSo far as is known, attempts to extend airfoil pressuredistribution calculations to three-dimensional flow have\nbeen confined to cases of thin lifting surfaces. I t has generally been assumed that the component of the pressure\ndistribution arising from the thickness of the airfoil will be\nbut little affected by the finite span, or aspect ratio, of the\nwing. This supposition is borne out by the known incompressible-flow solutions for flat ellipsoids. These solutions\nshow that the usual variations of aspect ratio produce small\neffects.\nCompressible-flow theory shows, however, that the effects\nof plan form become more pronounced at higher speeds.\nThe theory indicates a progressive reduction of the equivalent aspect ratio as the Mach number approaches 1.0.\nHence a t these speeds the three-dimensional character of tlic\nflow can no longer be neglected. Of particular interest are\nthe deviations from two-dimensional flow near the root\nsections of a swept-back wing, since the adverse effects of\ncompressibility may arise first in this region.\nIn the present report three-dimensional flows are obtained\nfrom a distribution of \xe2\x80\x9cpressure sources\xe2\x80\x9d in the chord plane\nof the airfoil. The shapes thus obtaincd are symmrtrical\nairfoils at zrro lift. The calculations are simplified by\nconsidering airfoils composed of conical or cylindrical surfacrs.\nIn these cases the sourres can be arranged into lines of uniform\nstrength following the generators of the surface. The relation\nbetween the strengths of the l i e sources and the shape of\nthe airfoil is the same as in reference I ; that is, each line\nsource produces a deflection of the streamlines crossing over\nthe source. The pressure field of the line source again can be\nrepresented by systems of straight rays of equal pressure\n(isobars) radiating from the ends of the line source.\n\nwhde the slope of the surface depends only on the individual\ncomponent w , that is\ndz w\n\n&=9\n(See appendix for symbols.) Hence in the thin-airfoil theory\nit is often more convenient to deal directly with the vrlocitirs\nu and w a solutions of Laplace\xe2\x80\x99s equation than to derivr\ns\nthese components from a velocity potential cp.\nSince u is proportional to the pressurr, a solution of\nLaplace\xe2\x80\x99s equation can represent directly the prrssurr distribution, hence the term \xe2\x80\x9cpressure potential.\xe2\x80\x9d In this\nterminology, the fundamental solution\n\nrepresents a point source of pressure rathrr than a point\nsource of fluid.\nTo get the effect of a row of sourrcs, or a linr sourcr, along\nthe z axis between thr points a and b, i t is nrcrmary to intrgrate equation (3):\nd5\n\nThe pressure field of the finite line source thus consists of thr\nsum of two conical prrssurr firlds radiating from the ends of\nthe line source.

Here, however,\nthe isobars extend over the whole space.\'\nIf the direction of flight is along the axis of the source\n(x axis), the flow will satisfy the boundary condition for a\nbody of revolution. However, if the line source is turned\nout to a position oblique to the stream, the boundary shape\nwill be distorted and, if the angle of obliquity is large enough\nto place the line source well outside the diameter of the\noriginal body, the figure formed will be an oblique wedge.\nThe nose angle of the wedge is formed where the streamlines\nof the main flow cross the l i e source.\nAt supersonic speeds the expression for the oblique line\nsource was obtained by applying an equivalent of the Lorentz\ntransformation, for which the wave equation is invariant.\nThe equivalent transformation for Laplace\'s equation is a\nrotation of the axes, given by\nx\'=x+my\ny\'=y-mx\n\nz\'=zJlfm2\nconieal pressure field for either the subsonic or the supersonic line source may be ob\ntamed directly from thegeneral solutions o Laplnce\'s equations o zero degree m 2,y, 2 given\nf\nf\nby W.

Following\nthc thin-airfoil theory, the pressure over the chord plane\n(z-+O) is taken as the pressure over the actual aidoil surface.\nAIRFOILS BOUNDED BY PLANE SURFACES\n\nIt was seen that the effect of a line source in the pressure\nfield is to cause a deflection of the streamlines crossing the\nS O I I ~ W . The deflection thus produced is equal and opposite\na t points above and below the chord plane, so that the\nsource spreads the streamlines apart. I the source is\nf\nfollowcd by a sink of equd strength, an equal opposite deflection of thc streamlines will occur as they cross over the sink.\nThe figure formed by the streamlines near the plane z=O\nwill thus be a plate of uniform thickness with a beveled\nlrading ~ t l g e . ~\n(See fig. 3.)\nAccorduig to the thm-arrfod thwry the thiekues of the f m\ni ends abruptly a t thc cnds\nal lhc wurw l a i s . 4 more exact consideration would be expected to show some rounding\nJI 1 hr I t p al t l w s ~tlgl.as mdiatcd m fimrc3.\n\nb4X1449\n\nI\n\nSecfion\n\nFIGUBB\n3 -Construction ofthe pr~ssuic\ndistribution over 3 hevrlcd leading alze.\n\n2\n\n419\n\nHEPOKT S O . 9 0 2-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AEKOSATTICS\n\nTlie pressure distribution over such a beveled edge may\nbe obtained very simply by superimposing the pressures laid\noPi on radial isobars originating from the four corners of the\nbevel. Figure 3 illustrates this process for a bevel having a\nsquare plan form. Only isobars from one tip are shown\nbecause of the symmetry of the figure.\nIn figure 3 , the line source and the line sink are parallel\nto the y axis, hence\n\nAhead of or behind this section the prcssures cancel.\nI n ease of a curved airfoil surface the chord can be tlividccl\ninto elements composed of source-sink pairs, the strengths of\nwhich are proportional to the slope of the surface a t the point.\nin question. Each pair then contributes a pressure proportional to the local slope and contributes no pressure a t other\npoints. Hence, equation (14) applies when dz/& is variable\nalong the chord.\n\nI t can be seen that if the aspect ratio of the figure is increased\nto a large value the ends of the line sources will be separated\nby a great distance and the isobars in intermediate regions\nwill approach parallel straight lines, hence the flow field\napproaches a cylindrical or two-dimensional form. A t the\nsame time the arguments y f l / l x + l l in equation (11) become y + v / x & 1 and q takes on very large values so that\n\nand equation (11) is found to approach the Legendre function Q0,that is\n\n(See reference 3, p. 110.)\nThis expression when combined with equation (8) agrees\nwith the two-dimensional potential function for the wedge,\ntliat is,\n- ( ~ - i ~ ) = 4 o(z)&2APo(~)\nQ\n\n(13)\n\n(See fig. 4.)\nThe isobars a t right angles to the axis of the line source are\nlines of zero pressure, hence the rays originating a t the tip\nof a rectangular wing contribute nothiig to the pressure\ndistribution at this tip. The whole pressure distribution\na t one tip is thus obtained by considering only those isobars\nradiating from the opposite tip. It is evident that in the\ncase of a long narrow rectangular wing the pressures a t\neither tip will be approximately one-bdf the pressures over\nthe middle portion of the wing.\nIn case the wing is oblique the tip sections will no longer\nbe at right angles to the axes of the sonrce lines and the rays\noriginating from the adjacent ends of the source lines will\ncontribute to the pressure over the tip. I t mn be shown\nthat this component of the tip pressure distribution is\nsimilar in form to the Ackerct type of distribution, that is,\nthe pressure a t any point of the surface is proportional to\nthe slope of the surface a t that point.\nConsider h s t the sloping surface formed by a pair of\noblique source-sink lmes. The tip section lies along the\nlines of constant pressure of magnitude proportional to\nsinli-\' I/m. Between the source and sink the pressures are\nadditive, so that\n\n420\n\n\'\n\nBiconvex Section\n\nu-iwccQ,/1.ll_+i~PpI\nfx)\nFIGURE\n4.-Two-diiensianal relocity innetions for \'.verlge and bicnnvcr srctmns.\n\nThe foregoing arguments of course apply only a t the tip\nsection of the oblique wing.

Furthermore, the shape of the pressure distribution over the root\nsection approaches the Ackeret shape more closely as the\nMach number approaches 1.O.

Such sections are undesirable, since they show infinite pressure peaks\na t the bends in the surface. Surfaces having continuous\ncurvature require continuous distribution of sources and sinks\nalined with the generators of the surface. The simplest of\nthese is the biconvex profile in which the upper and lower\nsurfaces are parabolic arcs and have constant curvature.\nSuch a profile requires line sources of finite strength to form\nthe desired angles of intersection of the arcs a t the leading\nand trailing edges together with a uniform distribution of\nsinks along the chord plane between the two sources.\nThe pressure field for a uniform sheet of line sources is\nobtained by integrating the field of a single line source in\ns\nthe x direction.

Calculations of the stability of the laminar boundary layer in twodimensional motion have been made by Tollmein, Schlichting and,\nmore recently, by Lees and Lin. The theoretical predictions have been\nverified experimentally in important respects by Dryden, Schubauer\nand Skramstad (references 3 and 4 ) , who find that transition to\nturbulent flow can result from fluctuations in the laminar layer. In\nthe case of a yawed plate or airfoil the calculated boundary-layer\nwaves would, of course, have their crests and troughs aligned with the\nleading edge and their stability would be determined by the Reynolds\nnumber of the crosswise component of the stream velocity. In case\ntransition is caused by such oscillations one would expect the transition\nline to recede from the leading edge with increasing angles of yaw in\na stream of constant velocity. On the other hand, if transition is\ncaused by roughness of the surface, a cylindrical flow cannot be assumed\nand the transition may, of course, be affected differently:\nAn interesting case which departs radically from the usual\nassumptions made for a cylindrical boundary has been investigated by\n.\n)\nG. I Taylor (see reference 5. Taylor investigates the stability of\nviscous flow in the annular space between two concentric circular\ncylinders in relative rotation. After a certain Reynolds number is\nexceeded the cylindrical form of the flow disappears and a regular\nvortex formation appears with the vortex rotations at 90\xc2\xb0 to the\nrotation of the cylinders, and alternating periodically along their\nlength. Gortler and Liepmann find similar three-dimensional disturbances\nin other cases of boundary-layer flow along convex walls. According\n)\nto Liepmann(reference 6 transition from laminar to turbulent flow\nresults from this three-dimensional type of instability if the surface\nis concave, but transition on a plane or convex surface results from\nthe two-dimensional type of wave motion mentioned earlier.\nFLOW SEPARATION AND MAXIMDM LIFT\nThe separation of flow over a straight wing occurs when the\nadverse pressure increase opposing the motion is sufficient to reverse\nthe momentum of the fluid in the boundary layer (see Fig. 3 ) . In the\ncase of the oblique wing the resultant pressure gradient is of course\nat right angles to the long axis of the wing and both this pressure\nand the components of the viscous stress distribution lying in this\ndirection will be determined by the crosswise component of velocity.\n\n478\n\nNACA TN No.\n\n1402\n\nHence t h e circumstances leading t o separation of flow over t h e s t r a i g h t\nwing w i l l be reproduced if t h e crosswise component of motion of t h e\noblique wing i s t h e same as that of t h e s t r a i g h t wing.

It is shown that the\nevaluation of the drag of such a blunt-nosed airfoil by the thina r o l theory requires the addition of a \xe2\x80\x9cleading-edge force,\xe2\x80\x9d\nifi\nanalogous to the well-known leading-edge thrust of the lifting airfoil. The method of calculation is illustrated by application to\n(1) the Joukowski airfoil in subsonic flow and (2) the thin elliptic\ncone in supersonic flow. The paper concludes with a general\nformula for the edge force which is applicable to a variety o\nf\nwing forms.\n\nvector will be represented by an analytic function of the\ncomplex variable f = x iz; that is,\n\n+\n\nu\n\n-i\nw\n\n= f(4)\n\nThe functionf is chosen to satisfy the desired boundary\nconditions around the slit -1 < x < +1 and to make\nu - i vanish at infinity.\nw\nBy a process of trial, it was found that for the example\nchosen\n\nZc-iw=\n\nINTRODUCTION\nof thin-airfoil theory to airfoils of finite thickness, care must be taken to Near the chord line E = x =toi and\nevaluate the effects of singularities that appear in the\nu/vt 2 1 2x\nthin-airfoil flows.

To carry out this limiting\nprocess, we select, in preference to the airfoil surface\nitself, a streamline a short distance above the airfoil\nsurface and, furthermore, allow the integration to extend a short distance ahead of the airfoil nose. The\ndrag is to be obtained from the product of the pressure\nand the slope of the streamline-that is, the product\nuw may be formed by noting that\n(u\n\n- iw)2 = u2 - w2 - 2iuw\n\n(6)\n\nConsidering a contour as illustrated in Fig. 3, the drag\nof a portion of the nose of the airfoil will be given by the\nintegral\n\nD,, I.P. of\n=\n\np\n\n(u - iw)VE =\n\nThe first term in the square brackets contains the singularity.

( 5 ) ] from the approximate surface pressure\nY -I\nc=\n:\n-I\np\ndistribution. The remaining terms in the integral (7)\n+I\nneed not be considered, since they correspond to this\npreviously determined value.\nFurther insight into the signiiicance of this calculation may be gained by an examination of the velocity\nfield represented by the complex velocity function (1).\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4, the velocity function shows that\nFIG.6. Transformation of conicai f o field.\nlw\nthe horizontal velocity u approaches - at the point\n1. Obviously, the leading edge of the airfoil will lie\nline and over the airfoil chord between * 1. An alter- some distance to the left of this singular point, since the\nnate treatment of the thin Joukowski airfoil is given in additive velocity u becomes equal and opposite to the\nreference 1\nstream velocity V before the point E = - 1 is reached.\n.\nAs is evident from Fig. 2, the thin-airfoil theory shows The point at which u = - V is the stagnation point\na negative pressure over the forward three-fourths of and marks the position at which the stream divides to\nthe airfoil, changing with a constant gradient t o a posi- form the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil.

Figs.\n5 and 6 illustrate these relations.\nAs in the case of the Joukowski airfoil, the elliptic\ncone requires a singularity of the order -1/2 in the\nexpression for the vertical velocity w to represent the\nrounded leading edge. A trial shows that the simple\nfunction*\n\n+\n\nFIG. Pressure distribution over thin elliptic cone in supersonic\n7.\nflow.\n\napproximation to the actual surface velocity distribution in the vicinity of the rounded nose. The exact\nshape and pressure distribution over the rounded nose\nare thus not determined by the thin-airfoil theory.\nThe determination of the drag of the nose portion without knowledge of its exact shape or pressure distribution is possible, however, because of the invariant property of the contour integral.\nSimilar considerations apply in the case of a lifting\nairfoil. Here, an inclined thin plate is used as an approximation to a lifting airfoil of finite thickness, and\nthe leading-edge force (a forward thrust in this case) is\ndetermined from the singularity in the flow around the\nedge of the plate. The plate in this case represents a\nline of discontinuity, or a vortex sheet, along the\ninterior of the airfoil.\nIn either case the application of the theory to compressible flows is made on the assumption that the configuration of the flow exterior to the airfoil remains essentially- similar to the corresponding incompressible\npotential flow. The contour of integration (Fig. 3)\nis further supposed to lie in a region where the additive\nvelocities are small, so that the velocity u and the\ncorresponding pressure can be corrected by the PrandtlGlauext rule.\n\nELLlprIc CONE SUPERSONIC\nIN\nFLOW\nAs an example of a supersonic flow, consider the case\nof the flattened elliptic cone which was previously considered by Squire. Adopting a variation of Busemann\'s method,a the velocity field may be described by\nan analytic function of the variable where\n\nsatisfies the boundary condition for an elliptic cone of\nmaximum thickness xt having its leading edges along\nthe lines y = *mx.\nThe horizontal perturbation velocity u, which determines the pressure distribution ( A 9 = -puV), is\nfound from w with the aid of the-condition for irrotational motion-that is, bu/bz = dw/bx. In terms of\nthe variable 5 this relation is equivalent to\n\n,\n.\nJ\n\nwhere the integration begins at a point of zero disturbance.\nIntegration for the ordinate of the surface yields\n\nThe constant t is seen to be the maximum thickness of\nthe section at x = 1.0.\nIn the present example, the sweep angle is assumed\nto be greater than the Mach angle so that the elliptic\ncone lies entirely within\' the Mach cone. The velocities u and w then vanish on the Mach cone, and u\ncan be determined by integrating Eq. (12) from - 1 to 1\n\nr\n\n= 2\xe2\x82\xac/(1\n\n+\n\na2)\n\n(9)\n\nand\n\n(14)\n\nwhere\n@ =\n\nAs pointed out in reference 3, the variable e is the argument of the general solution of Prandtl\'s equation, of\nzero degree (cf. references 4 and 5 for the equivalent\nsolution of Laplace\'s equation). The variable b is an\nanalytic transformation of E that maps the interior of the\nMach cone onto the whole complex plane, transforming\nthe Mach cone itself into the positive and negative\nbranches of the real axis outside the points * l . The\n\narc sin\n\ni\' -\n\nb2\n1 - m2\'\n\nA=-\n\nand Fand E are the elliptic integrals. A plot of the real\nsolution for u, which is proportional to the pressure\ndistribution, is shown in Fig. 7. It is interesting to\nnote that the elliptical cross section leads to a constant\n\n* The proper value of the function is selected with the aid of\nthe condition that w is to be discontinuousacross the real axis between * m and positive on the upper side.\n\n537\n\nsurface pressure distribution. This result has previously been obtained by Squire.\nAs in the preceding example, the drag is determined\nby integrating the product -piw along a stream surface just above the airfoil surface. Eqs. (11) and (14)\nfor u and w actually contain two (Le., the real and\nimaginary) solutions. Since the x d solutions are the\ne\nones uSed here, it is necessary to separate the product\nof the real solutions from the complex product uw.\nWith the aid of Eq. (12), it can be shown that the required product of the real solutions is equal to one-half\nthe real part of the complex product i a limited region\nn\nnear the nose of the airfoil where the term {/can be considered constant.\nWith this latter point in mind, the expression for the\nleading-edge force of a section at z = 1 can be written\n\nor, in coefficient form,\n\nfor both edges.\nThe contour for Eq. (15) crosses only a limited region\nnear the airfoil nose and involves in the limit only the\nsingular term\n- m2).Over the remainder\nof the interval the contour is equivalent to an evaluation of the surface pressure times the surface slope.\nOver this interval the pressure is constant, proportional\nto\n\nNOSE RADIUS = r\n\nFXG. General expression for force per unit length normal to\n8.\noblique leading edge.\n\nGENERAL\nEXPRESSION\nFOR LEADING-EDGE\nFORCE\n\nIn the foregoing example, the flow field is conical,\nand the drag coefficient of each section throughout the\nlergth of the conical body is the same. In more general\nexamples such as that described by Lighthill,2however,\nthis simplifying feature will not appear, and the coefficient of the leading-edge force will vary from point\nto point along the length of the edge. Furthermore, it\nwill not be possible, in general, to represent the entire\ngeometry of the flow field by a function of a complex\nvariable. However, if the body is sufficiently thin and\nflat and presents no abrupt changes in the radius of\ncurvature of the leading edge, the flow field in the immediate neighborhood of a point on the leading edge\nmay be considered to have a cylindrical, or two-dimensimal, form. In such cases the localized region of the\nflow field can be represented by a function of a complex\nvariable, and the contour integration for the leadingedge force can be performed. Fig. 8 illustrates the more\ngenerd relation obtained when this calculation is applied to an elliptical leading edge with nose radius r.\nIt is seen that the f,orce normal to the edge at large\nangles of sweep is approximately equal to that developed by the impact pressure of the normal stream\ncomponent acting on the developed area of the circular\ncylinder having the radius of the leading edge.\n\n{e/({2\n\nand the resulting drag is easily computed from the projected area of the cone-that is,\n\nIn this case, both the drag arising from the approximate surface pressure distribution and the leadingedge force act in the same direction so that the total\ndrag amounts to the sum of Eqs. (16) and (17).\n\nThe quantity t/2m is the "thickness ratio" of the cross\nsections of the elliptic cone. Eq. (18) does not, of course,\ninclude the wake drag that would arise if the cone were\ncut off so as to have a blunt base.\n\n538\n\nREFERENCES\n1 Allen. H.

JONES*\nAmes Aeronautical Laboratory, N .A.C.A.\nS-Y\n\nThe assumptions of the thin airfoil theory are found to provide certain necessary conditions for the minimum drag of airfoils\nhaving a given total l i t , a given maximum thickness. or a given\nvolume. The conditions are applicable to steady or unsteady\nmotions and to subsonic or supersonic speeds without restriction\non the plan form. The computationof drag and the statement of\nthe conditions for minimum drag depend on the consideration of\na \xe2\x80\x9ccombined flow field,\xe2\x80\x9d which is obtained by superimposing the\ndisturbance velocities in forward and reversed motions.\nI the plan form of the airfoil and its total lit are given, it is\nf\nfound that, for minimum drag, the lift must be distributed in such\na way that the downwash in the combined field is constant over\nf\nthe entire plan form. I the plan form is given and the thickness\nof the airfoil is required to contain a speciiid volume, then the\nthickness must be distributed over the plan form in such a way\nthat the\xe2\x80\x98pressure gradient of the combined field in the dreqtion\nof flight is constant a t all points of the wing. A specification of\nthe thickness along some lie drawn on the plan form is found to\nlead to the requirement that the gradient of the pressure vanishes\non either side of this line. For the drag to be a m i n i u m with\nrespect to small changes in the plan form, the foregoing conditions\nmust extend continuously for a small distance beyond the edge of\nthe plan form.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nT\n\nmoving through a fluid iS attributable partly to the action of tangential, or\nfriction, forces and partly to the action of normal pressures. With well-streamlined bodies, the friction forces\nare ordinarily confined to a relatively thin boundary\nlayer adjacent to the surface, and in such cases that\npart of the drag arising from the normal pressures can\nbe determined on the assumption of a frictionless potential motion in the region outside the boundary layer.\nA practical way of minimizing the pressure component of the drag is to make the body slender and its\nangle of attack small. Man? of the results of the modHE DRAG OF A BODY\n\nPresented at the Aerodynamics Session, Annual Summer Meeting, IAS. Los Angels, July 12-14, 1950.\n...\n* Aeronautical Engineer.\n\nern airfoil theory, such as the theory of the induced\ndrag of airfoils, are based on the assumption that the\n\nvelocities imparted to the air are small in relation to the\nvelocity of fight and, hence, are limited to cases of thin\nairfoils and small lift coefficients.\nIn the present paper, certain necessary conditions\nfor the minimum pressure drag of thin airfoils are derived. The analysis makes use of, and extends, certain\n\xe2\x80\x9creversed flow\xe2\x80\x9d theorems originally derived by Hayes\xe2\x80\x99\nand von K h % n 2\nand is based on the i%ea of superimposing the disturbances in forward and reversed\nmotions originally advanced by Munk.% Althowh\nthe analysis is restricted to motions involving small disturbances, the conditions for minimum drag are found\nto be applicable in a wide variety of circumstances of\nsuch motions. Thus, the motion may be steady or unsteady ahd the velocity of fight may be greater or less\nthan the velocity of sound.\n\nMINIMUM\nDRAG\nDUETO THICKNESS\nIn the linearized theory the effects of camber, or lift,\nand thickness can be treated independently and later\nsuperimposed in any desired linear combination. Wing\nproblems can therefore be divided into two classesi.e., those involving thickness but no lift and those involving a distribution of lift over a surface having zero\nthickness.\nConsider first the case of a thin nonlifting body or\nwing, such as shown in Fig. 1. The surface is assumed\nto be everywhere nearly parallel to a horizontal plane\nin the direction of motion. A distribution of thickness,\nsymmetrical above and below this plane, is supposed\nto be given over the plan form. Computation o the\nf\ndrag of such a body wl involve, first, the determinail\ntion of the pressure distribution over its surface. The\ndrag may then be obtained by one of two methods. In\nthe first method the body is divided into elements of\narea, and the element of drag is obtained from the in-\n\n559\n\nJOURNAL O F T H E AERONAUTICAL SCIENCES-FEBRUARY,\n\nPLAN -VIEW\n\nSIDE\n\nVIEW\n\nSHOWING PRESSURES\nFIG.1 Thin airfoil with elements representing slope of surface.\n.\n\nclination of the local pressure force. In the second\nmethod, which is related to the first through a integran\ntion by parts, the body is divided into small elements of\nvolume, and the drag is computed from the force of\nbuoyancy on each element arising from the local gradient of the pressure distribution.\n\nAs is well known, the pressure distribution over such\na t i ,nearly flat body can be calculated by considerhn\ning only the inclinations or slopes of the surface elements-without regard for the actual displacement of\nthe surface away from the mean plane. The body can\nthen be replaced by a large number of small elementary\nareas having slopes equal to the local slope of the surface. Each such element can be conceived to create a\ndisturbance field of its own, and the geometric character of this field will depend on the properties of the\nmedium (its elasticity, density, etc.) and on the circumstances of the motion. The disturbance fields of\nall elements will be alike except for a factor of strength,\nwhich is measured by the product of the area of the\nelement and its slope. The total disturbance field of\nthe body may be obtained by superimposing the individual disturbance fields of its elements.\nWith the aid of this concept of superposition it may\nbe shown that the drag of such a body is unchanged\nby a reversal of the direction of motion. The pressure\nat each point of the body is obtained by d\ng up\nthe influence at this point of every element of the surf ace. T h q drag is then obtainedby a second summation\ninvolving the total pressure force on each element and\nthe slope of its surface in the dragwise direction. Thus,\ntwo integrations over the surface are required- or four\nintegrals in a l A typical single element of this sum\nl.\n(see Fig. 1) will be represented by the pressure force\non element 2 caused by the pressure field of element 1\n;md multiplied by the slope of element 2. Now the\n\n560\n\n1951\n\npressure field of any element, regardless of the distribution or zone of action of the pressure, will be proprtional in magnitude to the slope and area of the element. The magnitude o the small contribution to the\nf\npressure on element 2 caused by element 1 will therefore be given by the product mlPpl,where ml is the\nh\n\xe2\x80\x9cstrength\xe2\x80\x9d of element 1as determined from t e product\nof its slope by its elementary area (i.e., ml is equal to\nthe frontal area of element 1)and where Pa is the pressure arising at ,element 2 from a unit disturbance at\nelement 1. The increment of drag produced will be\nequal to the product of the pressure mlPa by the area\nand the slope of element 24.e., mlPslm. In reversed\nmotion, element 1 will lie in the same relation to element\n2 formerly occupied by 2 in relation to 1. Hence, P.z~\nis equal to Pn provided the fluid itself is homogeneous.\nare both changed, but their\nThe signs of ml and\nproduct retains the same sign. The corresponding element of drag in reversed motion is, therefore, d n m l ,\nwhich is exactly equal to the element of drag in forward\nmotion. Such an equality can be assigned to every pair\nof elements and therefore must apply to the total drags\non forward and reversed motion.\nIt should be noted that the reversal principle involves\nhardly any restrictive assumptions aside from those involved in the linearization. It applies, therefore, to\nsteady or accelerated motions and to subsonic or supersonic speeds.\nThe fact that the drag of the body is the same for\neither direction of motion leads to the consideration of\na method of computing the drag wherein the forward\nand reversed disturbance fields are considered simulmeously. It is found that the sum of the two drags,\nor twice the actual drag, can be obtained by superimposing the two fields of disturbance vdocitie~and\nconsidering the pressures that would arise from motion\nof the combined field in the flight direction. The\nsuperposition of the two disturbance fields produces a\nfore-and-aft symmetry in the disturbance field of each\nelement, with the result that the combined flow field is\ngenerally simpler in structure than the actual physical\nfield and the calculation of drag is simplified. The\npressure in the combined field is simply the difference\nbetween the pressures in forward and reversed motions.\nIt can be shown that in the combined flow field the\nmutual interference drags of two distributions of thickness are equal. Consider two distributions A and B as\nillustrated in Fig. 2. The two distributions can be divided into an equal number of elements, and elements\nfrom the two distributions may then be paired in an\narbitrary way. Considering two elements such as 1\nand 2 shown in Fig. 2, it is\xe2\x80\x99evidemt from the symmetry\nof the combined field of &ch element that the drag of\nelement 1 caused by element 2 is equal to the drag of\nelement 2 caused by element 1. Since this equality\nholds for every pair of elements, it must hold for the\ntotal distributions A and B.\n\nMINIMUM DRAG OF THIN WINGS\n\nconsider two such\n\nelements of volume added to the\n\noriginal distribution as shown in Fig. 3 Fohwing the\n.\nprinaple o superposition, the drag added by the elef\n\nFIG.2.

What distribution of thickness over the plan form will result in the minimum\ndrag? First, let a distribution of t h i h e s s having the\nspecified volume and designed to achieve the minimum\ndrag be given. If the drag is actually a minimum, then\na small variation in the shape of the distribution will\nproduce no first-order change in the drag. The variation in shape must not change the original volume and,\nhence, may be divided into pairs of elements h a a g\nequal and opposite volumes. The drag of each element\nis a force of buoyancy equal to the volume of the element multiplied by the local gradient o the press~re.

The\nsigniscance of this condition in terms of the pressure\ndistributions on an oblique airfoil in supersonic motion\nis illustrated in Fig. 4.\nSECTION\nExamples of bodies satisfying this condition are not\nA-B\nV\ndifficult to find. One example is that of a t i ,flathn\ntened ellipsoid accelerating in an incompressible fluid.\nThe drag force in this case is in opposition to the acceleration of the motion and, hence, is attributed to a\n\xe2\x80\x9cvirtual additional mass\xe2\x80\x9d of the body. The surface\npressures due to the acceleration are proportional to\nB\nbq/bt, where Q is the surface potential. As is well\nknown, the surface potential of any ellipsoid moving\nV\nin a direction x parallel to a principal axis is of the form\n---D\nQ = KVx, where K is a constant depending on the\nproportions of the ellipsoid and V is the velocity. In\nSECTION C-D\naccelerated motion, &/at and, hence, the pressure are FIG.

The pressure distribution in the combined\nflow, therefore, has a constant gradient in the direction\nof x, and the ellipsoid satisfies the necessary condition\nfor minimum drag with a given volume. In this case\nthe condition is perhaps better stated as the condition\nfor minimum virtual voliime with a given actual volume.\nAnother example is that of a biconvex airfoil of infinite aspect ratio in steady motion at supersonicspeeds.\nI the upper and lower surfaces are parabolic arcs, the\nf\nAckeret theory gives a straight-line distribution of pressure from nose to trailing edge for motion in either\ndirection.\nThe foregoing method may be readily extended to\ndPc\n-=O\nother problems of minimum drag involving different\ndX\nC\nspecifications on the thickness distribution. Perhaps\nthe simplest of these is the case in which the thickness\nof the wing is spec5ed a!ong some line such as A-B\nSECTION C-D SHOWING\nin FiG. 5.

The existence of a constant presP* = Pa\n\nI-\n\n+\n\n562\n\nMINIMUM DRAG OF THIN WINGS\n\nsure means that the drag per unit of frontal area is constant.\nIt is interesting to note that the condition for minimum drag with a given frontal area requires that the\ndrag per unit frontal area be constant over the entire\nwing, while the condition for minimum drag with a\ngiven volume requires a constant drag per unit volume.\nIf the maximum thickness of each streamwise section\nis specified, then the drag per unit thickness must be\nconstant over each section.\n\nMINIMUM\nDRAG A GIVEN\nFOR\nLIFT\nThe foregoing principles of calculation can be carried\nover without essential modification to the problem of\nlift distribution. The drag arising from the lift can be\ncalculated independently of the thickness; hence, the\nsurface\xe2\x80\x9d slightly camwing can be considered a <\xe2\x80\x98lifting\nbered or twisted in such a way as to support the desired distribution of lift. A given distribution of lift\nwill induce a certain downwash velocity, and the resultant inclination of the stream lines must agree with the\nslope of the lifting surface a t all points. The drag of\nthe lifting surface will be computed by integrating the\nproduct of the local lift by the local inclination of the\nlifting surface.\nThe fact that a given distribution of lift has the same\ndrag for either direction of motion can be seen by considering the mutual drags of a pair of lifting elements.\nEach element of lift produces a distribution of downwash over the plane. The actual configuration of the\ndownwash field does not need to be specified, but its\nvalue a t all points is assumed to be proportional to the\nlift of the element. Hence the downwash of an element\nZl a t the position of another element 12 may be expressed\nin the form w21= llWzl, where Wzl is an influence function that depends on the geometric position of element\n2 in relation to element 1. The drag of element 2\ncaused by element 1is, therefore, ZIWz&.\nIn reversed motion the roles of the elements are reversed and the drag of element 1caused by element 2 is\nnow\nand WU = WZI. Similarly, the drag of element 2 caused by dement 1in reversed motion is equal\nto the drag of 11 caused by 12 in forward motion. These\nh\nstatements do not exclude t e possibility that ea& element lies wholly or paftially outside the zone of influence of the other element, and, hence, the reversal principle holds for unsteady or supersonic motions.\nSuppose a plan form and a distribution of lift are\ngiven, and consider again the field of perturbation veloci i s obtained by superimposing the fields in forward\nte\nmotion and in reversed motion. The horizontal perturbation velocities that give rise to the lift will be exactly canceled at each point of the surface. However,\nthe downwash velocities over the surface will not, in\ngeneral, be canceled, and the drag of the given distribution of lift for either direction of motion can be com-\n\nlaw&\n\nputed by considering this lift to act in t e combmed\nh\ndownwash field.\nIf consideration is restricted to the method of calculating drag by combining t e Bow fields in forward and\nh\nreversed motion, it is easily seen that the mutual interference drags of any two lifting areas are equal. The\ndrag of lifting surface A caused by the downwash of\nlifting surface B is exactly equal to the drag of B caused\nby the downwash field of A. This theorem follows\nfrom the symmetry of the combined flow fiela of any\nelement and the equality of interf-m\xe2\x80\x99\ndrags of two\nelements exactly as was previously demonstrated in\nthe case of thickness.\nConsider now a lifting surface supporting a given lift\nL, and suppose that a distribution of lift over the plan\nform designed to achieve the minimum drag under t e\nh\nstated conditions is given. Any small variation in the\net\nshape of the lift distribution which m e s the condition\nof constant total lift can be divided into pairs of elements of equal, opposite lifts. If the drag added by\nevery such pair of elements is zero, then the drag\nadded by any small continuous distributiyn of the required type will also be zero.\nConsidering two such elements of a small additional\ndistribution of lift, it is seen that the drag added to the\noriginal distribution will again consist of three parts:\n(1) the drag of the elements alone; (2) the drag added\nto the original distribution by the downwash fields of\nthe elements; and (3) the drag of the elements in the\ndownwash field of the original distribution. The drag\nof the elements alone will be of second order but will\nalways \\e positive so that the second-order variation\nin drag is positive. Items (2) and (3) will be equal by\nvirtue of the equality of mutual interference drags.\nFor the first-order variation in drag, therefore, we need\nonly consider the elements of lift acting in the downwash of the original distribution. Since the elements of\nl i t are equal and opposite, +eir drags will be equal and\nopposite, and the added drag will be zero if the downl\nwash is the same at each element. For al such pairs\nto contribute zero drag, the downwash must be constant\nover the whole wing. Hence, for minimum drag the\nlift must be distributed over the wing in such a way\nthat the downwash in the combined flow field is donstant at all points of the plan form. The condition is\nillustrated in Fig. 7.\n\nEXAMPLES\nOF\n\nTBE:\n\nMINIMUM\nDRAGOF LIFTING\n\nSURFACES\nThe stated condition for minimum drag with a given\ntotal lift obviously includes the well-known condition\nfor minimum induced drag in steady Gght at subsonic\nspeeds4 In that case the combined flow field is nothing\nmore or less than t h e two-dimensional field of motion\ninduced by the vortex wake that is normally trailing\nbut which now extends to i f n t both ahead of and\nniiy\nbehind the wing.

Thus, in the case of steady motion a t subsonic\nspeeds, the superposition o the forward and reversed\nf\ndisturbance fields, which are three-dimensional, results\nin a two-dimensional field of motion. In Supersonic\nmotion, the combined field retains its threeaun\n* &Onal\ncharacter, but the integration for the downwash is\n\n564\n\nNormally, the computation of: downwash over the\nlifting surface requires that the range of integration be\nlimited to a portion of the plan form so as to exclude\nthe forward branches of the Mach cones, where there is\nno real disturbauce. In the combined flow field, however, both branches of t e cones are to be included, and\nh\nthe integration for the downwash a t each point can be\nextended over the entire plan form provided the sign\no the radicalin the equation is chosen so that the downf\nwash of the lifting dement has the same sign in both\nbranches of the cone.\nOne example that lends i s l to calculation i that of\ntef\ns\nan extremely long n r o wing or "lifting line" at an\narw\nangle of yaw such that the line lies inside the Mach cone\nee\noriginating from its forward tip (see Fig. 8). Hr the\nintegration for the downwash in the combined flow\nfield extends from\'one end o the line to the other, as in\nf\nthe subsonic case, and it is found that an eIliptic distribution of lift results in a uniform dowawash, yielding\nthe value\n\nfor the minimum drag. Here, the quantity m is the\nratio o the dope of the lifting line to the slope o a\nf\nf\nMach line and is less than 1.0 when the croswise mms\nponent of velocity of the lifting line i subsonic. As\nthe angle of yaw is decreased so that the lifting line approaches the Mach cone, the drag of this distribution o\nf\nlift approaches infinitv. a fact that must be taken to\nm a that the concentration o a finite amount of lift\nen\nf\nwitbin an extremely narrow chordwise dimension i\ns\nnot perrnissble when the c r ~ ~ ~ w i s e\nvelocity cornpnmt\ni near sonic velocity or is supemonic.\ns\nFor a lifting surface of narrow proportions lyhg near\nthe center of the Mach cone, it is found that the -pression for the drag can be separatedinto two eomponeuts,.\n\nM I N I M U M DRAG OF T H I N W I N G S\n\none of which depends on the lengihwise distribution of\nlift while the other depends on the spanwise loading.\nThe minimum value in this case is found to be\n\nf A\n\nwhere b is the overall span of the wing and c is the overall length.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to\nformulate the latter problem in such a way as to lead to\na single definite solution that will be generally useful.\nThe foregoing analysis does, however, provide one important principle concerning wings of minimum drag.\nSuch wings will be characterized by the fact that the\ndrag is stationary not only with respect to variations\nin the lift or thickness distribution but also with respect to variations in the shape of the outline. Suppose the plan form of such a wing, together with the\ndistribution of lift or thickness satisfying the desired\ncondition for minimum drag, is given. If the drag is to\nremain unchanged when the outline of the wing is displaced through a small distance, then the distribution\nof pressure or downwash corresponding to a minimum\ndrag not only must appear over the plan form itself\nbut must also extend for a small distance, without iirstorder variation, away from the edge of the plan form.\nThat the foregoing condition leads to .a stationary\nvalue of the drag can be seen by considering the effect\nof a small displacement of the outline of a lifting wing,\nas illustrated in Fig. 9. Supposing the total lifts of the\noriginal and the distorted wings to be the same, lift\nmust be removed from the original area and placed on\nthe added area. The first-order variation in drag can\nagain be computed by considering only the effect of the\noriginal downwash field on the added distribution of\nlift. If this downwash, which was required to have a\nconstant value at all points of the original plan form,\nremains constant in the regions of the added area, then\na redistribution of lift from the original to the added\narea will not affect the total drag.\nCurves of variation of the drag with plan-form coefficients seldom show local maxima or minima but show,\nmore often, a monotonic character. As an example\n\nFro. 9.\n\nCondition for drag to be a minimum with respect to\nvariations i plan form.\nn\n\nwe may consider the induced drag of wings a t subsonic\nspeed. Here, the combined flow field, as previously\nnoted, is simply the two-dimensional motion induced\nby the vortex wake, and, in the case of minimumdrag,\nthe downwash is constant over the whole wake extending ahead of and behind the wing. Smce the condition for minimum drag persists along the whole wake,\nthe drag is unaltered by any displacement of the Wing\nboundary in the chordwise direction parallel to the\nwake. I one proceeds beyond the tip of the wing,\nf\nhowever, the downwash changes sign abruptly, and\nIarge values of upwash are encountered. The drag is\nthus not a minimum with respect to changes in the span\nof the wing but can be continually diminished by removing area from the center portions of the wing and\nplacing it at the tips. At supersonic spekds, the minimum drag for a given area and lift occurs when the\nwing surface is disposed along narrow lines lying near\nthe center of the Mach cone and having the greatest\npossible length and span.\nREFERENCES\n\n\'Hayes, Wallace D..

JONES*\nAmes Aeronautical Laboratory,\n\nhSTRACr\n\nConsider a t i wing in frictionless flow and suppose the plan\nhn\nform of the wing and also the total lift to be given. The drag of\nthe Wing will then depend on the way in which the lift is distributed over its surface. In a previous paper, it was shown that\nthe minimnm drag occurs when the superposition of the induced\nn\nn\ndisturbance fields i forward and reversed motion results i a\nconstant value of the induced downwashat all points of the wing\nsnrface. Similar problems involving the ideal distribution of\nthickness over the snrface were found to lead to similar conditions governlng the distribution of pressure in the superimposed\nor \xe2\x80\x9ccombined\xe2\x80\x9dflow field.\nThe present paper describes a method for determining mathematically the combined disturbance field, and in certain cases the\nminimum drag, of wings at supersonic speeds. The simplest\nanalytic example is provided by the wing of elliptic plan form,\nwhich achieves its minimum drag when the lift is distributed\nuniformly over the surface. With a symmetrical distribution of\nthickness. the requirement of minimum drag for a given total volume i found to lead to profiles of constant curvature.\ns\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nat subsonic speeds, it is\nshown that the production of lift by a wing of k i t e\nspan gives rise to a drag force that depends on the distribution of lift over the span. This component of the\ndrag, which arises in frictionless motion, may be related to the energy required for the continual extension\nof the two-dimensional field of motion induced by the\nwake of trailing vortices. Alternatively, by examining\nconditions in the vicinity of the wing sections, the drag\nmay be related to the downward inclination of the air\nstream induced at the position of the wing by the action of the trailing vortices. Following the latter concept, the drag arising from the lift at subsonic speeds\nhas been termed the \xe2\x80\x9cinduced drag.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Shown by\nMunkl that this drag is a minimum for a given l i t and\na given span when the induced downwash is constant\nat all points of an equivalent lifting line, or vortex, having the same spanwise distribution of l i f t as the wing.\nIt was further shown by Munk that the induced drag\nis actually independent of the chordwise distribution of\nlift.\nAt supersonic speeds an additional component of\ndrag arises because of the formation of waves by the\nairfoil, and in this case the drag depends on both the\nspanwise and chordwise distributions of lift or, in other\n\nI\n\nN THE THEORY O F WINGS\n\nPresented at the AerodynamicsSession, Annual Summer Meeting, I.A.S.,July 16-18,1952.\n* Aeronautical Engineer.\n\nN.A.C.A.\n\nwords, on the actual distribution of lifting pressure\nover the surface of the wing. In order to extend Munk\xe2\x80\x99s\nproblem to wings at supersonic speeds i t was necessary\ntherefore to consider cot merely the span as given but\nthe actual shape of the wing in plan view. The problem could then be stated in the following form: For a\ngiven plan form s and a given total lift L,what distribution of the lift L over the surface s results in the\nminimum drag?\nFurthermore, at supersonic speeds a certain drag\narises from the thickness of the airfoil independently\nof the lift. The two components of d h g may, however, be considered separately and later added in any\ndesired combination. To isolate the effect of lift, as distinct from the effect of thickness, it is sufficient to replace the wing by its mean surface, which is supposed\nto be warped or cambered in whatever way may be required to cause the specified distribution of lift. On\nthe other hand, the drag arising from the thickness may\nbe determined by considering the thickness to be symmetrically disposed above and below a flat mean scrface having no lift. In this way additional problems\ninvolving the ideal distribution of thickness over the\nplan form become apparent.\nIn reference 2 it was shown that all distributions of\nlift having the minimum drag for a given plan form and\na given total lift are chafacterized by a single condition. If we suppose the wing with its given distribution\nof lift to be held fixed in a stream of velocity V, then\nthere will arise in the vicinity of the wing and its wake\nadditional small disturbance velocities u, v, and w.\nNow let the direction of the stream be reversed, but suppose that the curvature and inclination of the surface\nis so modified as to maintain the original distribution of\nlift. A new field of disturbance velocities u, v, and w\nwill appear. The wake of trailing vortices will have\nthe same form as before, but the wake will now extend\nfrom the wing in the opposite direction. We may now\nsuperimpose the two fields of disturbance velocities\nand obtain by this means a \xe2\x80\x9ccombined \xe2\x80\x98disturbance\nfield,\xe2\x80\x9d associated with the given distribution of lift.\nFor the drag to be a minimum, the downwash in the\ncombined disturbance field must be constant at all\npoints of the wing surface s.\nI the velocity of flight is subsonic, the superposition\nf\nof the two fields can be shown t o result in a two-dimensional field of motion identical in form to the velocity\n\n569\n\nJOURNAL O F THE AERONAUTICAL SCIENCES-DECEMBER,\n\n1952\n\ntwo-dimensional flows.

Hence, for the integration\nin the X plane around both loops, the lateral velocity v,\nwhich is an odd function ofzand discontinuousacrossthe\nstrip. vanishes, leaving a real value of the downwash\nw which is continuous throughout the field.\n\nReturning to Eq.

If, in addition, the s9anwise loading is elliptical, then the fnlinia\ntegrated value of the downwash will be a constant.\n\nMINIMUM\nDRAGOF ELLIPTICWINGS AT Sup~momc\nSPEED\nThe foregoing discussion indicated that the downwash\nwill be constant over the plan form if the integrated\nloading in every oblique direction is elliptical. This\ncondition is, of course, merely a sufficient, and not a\nnecessary, one. The condition is met in the case of the\nelliptic plan form having a uniform surface distribution\nof lift. Hence it is concluded that such a uniform surface loading yields the minimum drag in the case of the\nelliptic wing.\nThe downwash of the elliptic wing may be calculated\ndirectly from Eq. ( 1 .

Recently I flew, together with eighty\nother passengers, in a scheduled airliner from Kansas City to Los\nAngeles. On this flight we averaged about 8/10 of a mile per gallon,,\nor 65 miles per gallon for each passenger. Thus we achieved about\nthe same mileage as an ordinary automobile while traveling at six\ntimes the speed.\nIt is easily seen that the efficiency of the subsonic airplane depends\non the favorable aerodynamic properties of the wing in this speed\nrange. The possibility of such good lifting efficiency was not obvious\nto earlier students of hydrodynamic theory-because of an uncertainty\nin the choice among possible solutions of the flow equations.\nEarly predictions of airplane performance were based on the choice\nof the Helmholtz flow. In this flow what is now known as the Kutta\ncondition was applied at both the leading edge and the trailing edge,\nand the wing was followed by a wake of dead air attached to its upper\nsurface. One of the first text books on aeronautics I studied was entitled \xe2\x80\x98Aeroplane Construction and Operation,\xe2\x80\x9d by John B. Rathbun\n(Ref. 1). It was written in 1918 when the wing theory as we now understand it was relatively unknown in this country. On page 93, I find the\nfollowing statement: \xe2\x80\x9cAs already explained, the behavior of a body in\nan air stream cannot be predicted with any certainty by direct mathematical calculation and, for this reason, each and every aerodynamic\nbody must be tested under conditions that are as nearly similar to the\nactual working conditions as possible. Prior to Professor Langley\xe2\x80\x99s\nfirst experiments in 1887, mechanical flight with a heayier-than-air\nmachine was derided as an impossibility, even by such scientists as\nNavier, von Helmoltz, Gay-Lussac, and others who proved by the most\nintricate calculations that a body larger than a bird could not be supported by its own energy. Such calculations were, of course, based on\na wrong understanding of air flow and, as no experimental work had\nbeen done up to that time, the flow was assumed according to the individual taste and belief of the demonstrator. The presence of a vacuum on the back of a plate was not understood and, as this contributes\n\n581\n\nHIGH-SPEED AERONAUTICS\nfull two-thirds of the lift, it is an easy matter to see why all of the\nearly predictions fell short of the actual lifting forces. To quote one\nclassic absurdity, the scientist Navier proved mathematically that if\nmechanical flight were possible, then 17 swallows would be capable of\ndeveloping one horsepower.\nAlsoin1918, we find in the work of de Bothezat (Ref. 2) (NACA Rep.\n28) a theory of airfoils based on the assumption of leading-edge separation and the introduction of a K 6 r d n vortex trail in the wake above\nand behind the wing. In his consideration of the tip vortices de Bothezat obtains the modern form o the law of induced drag. This compof\nnent of the dragwas, however, negligible in comparison to that induced\nby the lateral vortices in the wake.\nIn contrast to these more conservative assumptions, the Kutta-Joukowsky theory predicts large values of the lift without accompanying\npressure drag in two-dimensional motion. The degree to which this\nideal dragless type of flow can actually be approached under suitable\nconditions is well illustrated by an experiment made by E. N. Jacobs\n(Ref. 3) at the NACA\'s Langley Laboratory a number of years ago.\nThe airfoil in this experiment had a %foot chord and extended completely across the (low turbulence) wind tunnel (Fig. 1). At an airspeed of 50 miles per hour and an angle of attack of 7", a lift force of\n\nFigure 1 -Airfoil compared with circular wire having\nequal drag.\n\n100 pounds was measured. The drag amounted to only slightly more\nthan one-third of a pound, so that the lift-drag ratio was nearly 300to\n1. For comparison a round rod or wire having the same drag as the\nlifting airfoil is also shown.\nFlows of the Helmholtz or de Bothezat type are not completely contrary to experience, and yet an airplane designed according to those\nformulas would have a decidedly unconventional appearance and would\nrequire a large thrust. A modern airplane in cruising flight obtains\nabout three times as much thrust from the suction developed in the\nflow around the leading edge as it does from its engines. This type of\nassistance from the flow requires a wing of large aspect ratio. In recent years the aspect ratios of transport airplanes have increased to\nvalues of 10 or more. Calculations can be made which show that, if\n\n582\n\nJONES\nthe energy required to transport a given payload were the deciding\nfactor, then stillfurther increases in aspect ratio at the cost of structural weight would be desirable.\nA s is well known, the fuel consumption of most vehicles increases\ndisproportionately when we try to increase their speed simply by installing more horsepower. The airplane differs from earth-bound\nvehicles in this respect, however, sirice, by climbing to a higher altitude, it can increase its speed without necessarily increasing the fuel\nconsumption per mile of flight.\nIn 1929, B. V. Korvin-Kroukovsky (Ref. 4) published a series of\narticles in \xe2\x80\x9cAviation\xe2\x80\x9d entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cThe High Altitude Airplane.\xe2\x80\x9d In that\ndiscussion it was pointed out that high economical cruising speeds\ncould be achieved by an ordinary low-speed airplane if this airplane\nand its power plant could be equipped for operation at high altitudes.\nKorvin-Kroukovsky\xe2\x80\x99s argument was roughly a s follows: The ratio of\nlift to drag of a conventional airplane is determined primarily by its\nexternal form and is essentially independent of the airspeed, the wing\nloading, and the air density. If the airspeed is increased while thd\nairplane is held at a fixed angle of attack, both the lift and the drag\nwill increase with the square of the speed but tend to remain inthe\nsame ratio. Now an airplane of conventionalform and loading achieves\nits maximum lift-drag ratio at a rather high angle of attack, which\ncorresponds to a low airspeed at sea level. One method of increasing the speed is to supply more thrust and counteract theincreased\nlift by reducing the angle of attack. Eventually the horsepower required begins to increase as the cube of the speed and the fuel consumption per mile increases, as it does for other vehicles. However,\nif the airplane is kept trimmed at its optimum angle of attack and the\naltitude is increased so that the air density diminishes in proportion\nto the inverse square of the speed, then the air forces, both the lift\nand the drag, remain constant. In this way the speed can be increased\nwithout the requirement of any additional thrust. Since the drag and\nthe thrust required do not increase, then the energy expended per mile\nof flight remains constaat and we can obtain, theoretically, the same\nnumber of miles per gallon at progressively higher speeds.\nLet us see what happens if we apply this concept to a small lightly\nloaded airplane of the \xe2\x80\x98Cub\xe2\x80\x9d type. Such an airplane might cruiseat\nperhaps 100 miles per hour at a lift-drag ratio of 15 to 1. Suppose a\nthrust of 1/15 the weight can be supplied at any altitude and t!!t some\nexcess thrust is available for climbing. Figure 2 shows the progressive increase of cruising speed with altitude. At 40,000 feet the speed\nwill have increased to 200 miles per hour and at 68,000 feet the Cub\nw l be traveling at 400 miles per hour.\nil\nmay ask whether the fabric wings will withstand such a speed or w\ne r there will be difficulty\nin moving the controls. Of course the indicated airspeed has remained\nat 100 miles per hour so that the air forces remain essentially unchanged. One effect that might be noticeable is a relative loss in the\ndamping of angular motions.\nobvious advantage of this method of\n\n583\n\nHIGH-SPEED AERONAUTICS\n\nALTITUDE\nIN\nM\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nspEED/SPED AT S\xe2\x82\xacA LEVEL\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nF g r 2 -Increase o cruising speed w t altitude for constant\niue\nf\nih\nthrust.\n\ngaining speed is that it does not interfere with the ability of the airplane to slow down for landing at lower levels.\nAt first thought one is inclined to ask whether the climb to such a\ngreat altitude would be worth-while for any except the longest journeys.\nAlthough the increased distance involved in the high altitude path is not\nimportant, the time spent at lower altitudes and slower speeds amounts\nto a considerable fraction of the duration of trips less than 500 miles.\nHowever, calculations I have made indicate that, if the means were\navailable, a climb as high as 80,000 feet would save time on a 500 mile\nflight.\nIn this connection it is interesting to note that the plan of operation\nof the Comet airliner, as explained by A. C. Campbell-Orde (Ref. 5)\nin his paper given at the 20th annual meeting of the Institute of the\nAeronautical Sciences, requires a climb to 35,000 feet for the purpose of reaching an alternate airport only 250 miles distant. The saving of time here is essential because of the fuel-burning characteristics\nof the turbojet engine.\nSince density is a relative matter, we might consider, alternatively,\nincreasing the economical cruising speed at low levels simply by increasing the density of theairplane. This method has a marked structural advantage, since the same load would be supported by a more\ncompact structure. A comparison of these methods, that is, increasing altitude vs. increasing airplane density leads to some interesting\nresults. We should also consider the possibility of simply increasing\nthe thrust. This latter method may be thought of as that presently in\nvogue among automobile manufacturers.\nThe followingtable (Fig. 3) shows some results of this comparisonwhich, needless to say, is made on the simplest possible basis. The\nnumbers listed under the three airplanes to the right show various results of doubling the speed in the subsonic range. In the first method\nthe speed is increased simply by increasing the thrust and the balance\nbetween lift and weight maintained by reducing the angle of attack be-\n\n584\n\nJONES\nI\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 3- Comparison of three methods of.increasing speed.\n\nlow the optimum value. In the case of a propeller-driven airplane the\nrange in miles per gallon would fall to about one-half and, because of\nthe increased gust force, the ride would be twice as \xe2\x80\x9cbumpy.\xe2\x80\x9d With jet\npropulsion the range in either case wouldbe rather poor but would not \xe2\x80\x99\nbe decreased by going to the higher speed. Of course a considerable\nincrease in the structural stiffness would be required for the higher\nspeed.\nIn following the second method we would attempt to conceal the same\nmass and payload in an airplane of one-half the size. If this can be\ndone it is seen that the speed may be doubled without any increase in\nthe required thrust. Thus with jet propulsion the range in miles per\ngallon will. be increased by about the same factor. Furthermore, the\nriding qualities of the airplane will be improved. The engineering advantage of supporting the given load on a more compact structure is\nimmediately apparent. One difficulty with this method is that the landing speed increases in the same ratio as the cruising speed.\nIf only the final result is considered, it is clear that an increase of\nthe cruising altitude is the best method of gaining speed. If we can\nassume that gust velocities diminish at higher altitudes then the gust\nforces will be even lower than indicated by the table. Each method is\nessentially limited by the possibilities of engine development. The\ndenser airplane requires the same thrust from engines having onefourth the normal frontal area, while the engines of the high altitude\nairplane must develop the required thrust in an atmosphere of onefourth normal density.\nIt seems that airplane constructors have actually utilized the benefits of increased density as far as practicable, but the result has been\nheavier airplanes rather than smaller ones. Figure 4 shows a logarithmic plot of weight versus wing span for a nuniber of successful\ncommercial aircraft. It will be noted that older airplanes and smaller\nones, whose design has not changed, tended to follow the law of constant wing loading, that is, W s b2. Modern airplanes, especially since\nrestrictions on the landing speed have been removed, tend-to follow\n\n585\n\nHIGH-SPEED AERONAUTICS\n\nI50\n10\n0\nSPAN.\n\nFEET\n\n50\n\n..\n\n."\n\nWEIGHT,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI"\n\nIbs\n\nFigure 4 -Airplane weights a s a function of a linear dimension.\n\nwhat might be termed a line of \'"maximum density." Such a trend,\ncorresponding to constant weight per unit volume, seems to indicate a\nmaximum practical utilization of the space within the airplane. The\nweight per unit of actual volume along this line approaches tha;t of a\nloaded railway coach. With the original engine used by Orville and\nWilbur Wright the possibility of flight depended on achieving a structure having the minimum density. With present engines it seems that\nthe successful constructor must achieve a maximum density. Although\ncalculations of the landing speed have always occupied an important\nplace in aeronautical engineering, they do not seem to have influenced\nthe final result appreciably.\nFor many years the airplane designer has advocated a decrease in\nlanding speeds, and yet he has evidently been forced by economic considerations to follow the trend of maximum density according to which\nthe landing speed increases with the size and weight of the airplane.\nNot long ago landing speeds greater than 65 miles per hour were considered unsafe. Last year, however, approximately 50,000,000 people\ntook off and landed, mostly at speeds of over 100 miles per hour. The\nlanding of transport airplanes at present-day speeds and loadings has\nproved to be a far safer and more reliable proposition than the landing of early model airplanes, which, with their light wing loadings and\nslow speeds, could hardly be managed in normal winds and gusts.\nThere is, of course, a limit to increases of the economical cruising\nspeed of the subsonic airplane and the same limit appears whether we\nattempt to increase the speed by increasing the density of the airplane\nor by increasing the altitude of flight. This limit is set by the wellknown sudden increase of pressure drag at a critical Mach number.\nI the optimum lift coefficient and the critical Mach number are given,\nf\nthen we can derive an optimum ratio between the wing loading and the\nambient atmospheric pressure Pa. This ratio is\n\nand corresponds to the highest cruising speed without loss of efficiency.\n\n586\n\nJONES\n\nAt CL, = 1.0 and M, = 0.7 we obtain a wing loading of 1/3 of an\n,\natmosphere. Thus, for cruising flight at sea level we require about\n700 pounds per square foot. At 60,000 feet, however, the ambient pressure fallstoonly 150 pounds per square foot, so that the optimum wing\nloading becomes 50 pounds per square foot. This latter value corresponds to the current density of construction and loading and enables\nlandings to be made at not over 100 miles per hour. It is certainly\nsurprising that our present day heavy wing loadings are really best\nadapted to the thin air at 60,000 feet.\nIt has been said that as the speeds of a i r c r g t increase the wings\nmust become proportionately smaller. However, it is hard to discern\nthis trend in the geometric proportions of actual airplanes. Thus, the\nComet airliner which flies at about 4-1/2 times the speed of the Ford\nTrimotor seems to have proportionately even larger wings. Such studies as I have made indicate that if economy of propulsion is to be a\nmajor factor, then the relative proportions of the wings will not diminish even at supersonic speeds.\nWith the velocity given in terms of the Mach number there exists,\nthe temptation to think of supersonic speeds in increments of a whole\nunit. However as our understanding of supersonic wave drag and lift\nincreases it seems increasingly probable that the speeds of commercial aircraft will grow continuously in this range, just as they have in\nthe subsonic range. If we are willing to assume such a continuous\ntransition to the problems of air transportation at supersonic speeds,\nthen it will seem appropriate to follow the trends of loading, density,\nand altitude disclosed by the preceding development of the subsonic\nairplane.\nThe appearance of the wave drag at supersonic speeds does of\ncourse require a marked change in the form of an airplane designed\nfor economical flight. Figure 5a illustrates for bodies of revolution\nthe change in the optimum slenderness ratio on going to supersonic\ns\nspeeds. The volume of both bodies i the same and theproportions\nshown minimize approximately the sum of the drag arising from the\nnormal pressures and from the friction of a turbulent bourldary layer.\nThe balance between friction and wave drag is such that a single object 5 feet in diameter requires a fairing 75 feet long.\nA s a further illustration of the relFtive magnitude of the wave drag\nfor different forms, I show in Figure 5b two models which, accxding\n\nFigure Sa-Change in the ideal proportions of a body of revolution on transition to supersonic speeds.\n\n587\n\nHIGH-SPEED AERONAUTICS\n\nFigure 5b -Models having same drag at low supersonic speed, (zero lift).\n\nto the indications of our experiments, would have the same total drag\nat a low supersonic Mach number. This comparison of course ddes not\napply to cruising flight since the comparison is made at zero lift.\nWith regard to the ideal form of the supersonic wing it is interesting to translate the following from Dr. Busemann\xe2\x80\x99s paper given 20\nyears ago at the Volta Congress in Rome (Ref. 6:\n)\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is clear that the arrow form, quite apart from other considerations, must be favorable since the pressure differences producing lift\nare fully effective, whilst those producing drag have only a component\nin the directionof flight. If now a reduction of the effective Mach number makes. possible the utilization of a greater surface loading at the\nsame angle of incidence, the relative effect of the shearing forces in\nthe friction layer necessarily decreases.\xe2\x80\x9d According to our present\nconcept a \xe2\x80\x9csubsonic\xe2\x80\x9d sweep angle will be required to achieve this objective.\nOn the basis of the papers of Prandtl (Ref. 7) and vonKkm6n (Ref. 8)\nat the 1935 VoltaCongress linearized supersonic floy theory has been\nused to develop the means for estimating the wave resistance of a wide\nvariety of shapes. Even on this simplified basis, however, the formulas\noften become rather complex so that the trends to be followed by the designer are not clearly displayed. One method o obtaining more inf\nstructive formulas is to study the minimum values of the drag under\nvarious engineering constraints. As an example we may think of Munk\xe2\x80\x99s\nproblem of the minimum induced drag of a wing with a limited span.\nAt subsonic speeds, even if we allow a large area for the production\nof lift, the minimum drag can still be achieved by a concentration of\nthe lift along a narrow \xe2\x80\x9clifting line\xe2\x80\x9d having a small exposed area and\nhence small friction. A t supersonic speeds the minimum pressure\ndrag usually requires that the given lift be spread over as large an\narea as allowed by the constraint. An interesting example is provided by the wing of elliptic plan form, which curiously enough seems\nto have especially simple mathematical properties at supersonic\n\n588\n\nJONES\n\n153\n\nspeeds (Ref. 9). Here the optimum distribution shows no concentration of the lift in any preferred region, but spreads uniformly over\nwhatever elliptical area is allotted. The resulting formula for the\npressure drag is\nDmin = 2\npv2s\n\nHere a/b is the axis ratio, subject to the Prandtl-Glauert transformation.\n.\nE. W. Graham, H Luskin, and P. A. Lagerstrom (Ref. lo), in studies made for the Douglas Aircraft Company (Ref. 10 et. seq.), have\nextended these ideas to distributions of lift in three dimensions. As\npointed out to the author by Graham, formula (2) yields the minimum\ndrag not only for the given elliptical area but also for an enlarged area\nbounded by Mach lines and by lines parallel to the stream direction.\nWith a straight ellipse the reduction of drag for a given total lift 0:\nfor a given maximum thickness depends primarily on increasing the\nexposedwingareas. If we consider an oblique ellipse, then a different\nform of dependence appears. In this case Eq. (2) is replaced by\n\nHere m is defined by the shearing transformation of the ellipse:\nx \' = x + m \' y , y\'=y,\na \' is the intercept of the sheared ellipse with the longitudinal x axis\nand b is the maximum semispan (see Ref. 9). If we now assume that\nthe area allotted by our constraint is that bounded by the Mach lines\nand the streamlines as shown in Fig. 6, it is seen that the area actually occupied by the ideal distribution becomes extraordinarily small\nwhen the wing is yawed behind the Mach cone. This change coincides\nwith the reappearance of the Kutta-Joukowsky flow, and enables the\n\nFigure 6-Optimum distribution of lift\nfor area bounded by streamlines and\nMach lines tangent to ellipse.\n\n5 89\n\nHIGH-SPEED AERONAUTICS\nrequirements of minimum pressure drag and minimum friction drag\nto be satisfied simultaneously.\nAt large angles of sweep or yaw the drag due to lift becomes in a\nlarge measure independent of the exact distribution, but depends primarily on the span b and the length 1 of the wing. For such cases the\nsimpler approximate formula\nDmin =-\n\nL2\n\nM 2 -1 L2\n+ *\nz\n\n(4)\n\nshows the essential dependence. The minimum drag occurs when both\nthe lengthwise and the spanwise loadings are elliptical.\nFor supersonic speed we thus require the maximum span b and the\nmaximumlength 1, together with the minimum of exposed area. These\nconditions determine the oblique, elliptically loaded lifting line as an\nideal limiting form for the supersonic wing. It seems unfortunate that\na bilaterally symmetrical form, such as a swept wing or a V-shaped\nlifting line could not satisfy the requirement. However if we bend the\nlifting line at the middle to form a V it is seen that the wave resistance\nincreases considerably.\nIn order to show the effect of more conventional wing forms on potential supersonic cruising efficiency, I have estimated the lift-drag\nratios of several wings in combination with a slender fuselage. Converting these to values of the thrust required by an airplane weighing\n50,000 pounds and cruising at 900 miles per hour yields the values\nshown on Fig. 7. For this comparison the wing thicknesses were selected so as to make possible equal bending stiffness. The order of\nthe comparison would not be changed, however, if a wing of zero thickness were substituted in any one of the examples.\nFor an operating altitude of 60,000 feet the wing loading in the first\ntwo examples should be about 50 pounds per square foot-or the same\n\n5QOO\n\nIbs\n\n7poo I bs\n\n9,000Ibs\n\nFigure 7-Effect of wing form on required cruising\nthrust. Values shown are for 50,000-Ib. airplane.\n\n590\n\nJONES\nas that of a subsonic airplane of this size. Since the indicated airspeed\nat 60,000feet is one-third the true airspeed, the structure needs to be\nsufficiently rigid to withstand-with customary safety margins-a sealevel cruising speed of only 300 miles per hour.\nFigure 7 also shows the relative proportions of a conventional turbojet engine designed to produce 10,000 pounds of thrust at sea level.\nUnder our conditions the thrust will be diminished to about one-fourth\nthis value, so that two such engines would be required in the first example. In this case we obtain a specific range of more than one mile\nper gallon. This latter value compares favorably with that achieved by\nearly model Trimotors, but is of course somewhat less than that obtained with present-day transports operating at subsonic speeds.\nWe hear a greatdeal these days about the "heat barrier." However,\nat 900 miles per hour and 60,000 feet this barrier has notyetbeen\nreached. It may be readily calculated that at this speed the aerodynamic heating is no more sufficient to bring the airplane up to room\ntemperature at these levels. Of course, demonstrations of speed at\nsea level would be rigidly prohibited, both for structural and therqal\nreasons.\nTo adapt the airplane to a lower altitude the wing loading needs to\nbe increased. However, if we assume that the maximum density has\nalready been reached in examples I and 1 , this cannot be done within\n1\nthe limitation of strict geometric similarity. On the other hand, if the\nairplane is adapted to the lower altitude simply by reducing the size of\nthe wing, then the lift-drag ratio will naturally be reduced. In example\nIIIof Figure 7 the wing area was so reduced to suit conditions at 40,000\nfeet. The thrust required to support the given load then increased to\n9000 pounds. Of course if strict geometric similarity could be maintained, a sacrifice of economy would not be involved.\nComparisons of such oversimplified wing-body combinations as\nshown here may not disclose the full effect of a loss in aerodynamic\nf\nefficiency. I the thrust needs to be increased at a given altitude then\nmore or larger engines will have to be used and the possibility of concealing them becomes less. In this process the lift-drag ratio of the\ncomplete airplane may become still more unfavorable than indicated\nby the comparison.\nThese primarily aerodynamic and structural considerations point\ntoward the development of turbojet engines specifically adapted to\noperation in an atmosphere of one tenth normal density. In addition to\nthe numerous other technological problems associated with operation\nat these highaltitudes, the problems of safe descent and effective limitation to low speeds at low altitudes seem important.\n\n591\n\nHIGH-SPEED AERONAUTICS\nREFERENCES\n\n1 \xe2\x80\x9cAeroplane Construction and Operation,\xe2\x80\x9d John B.

JONES\nT\nSUMMARY\n\nStudies o various arrangements of wings and bodies designed\nf\nto prowide favorable wave interference at supersonic speeds lead\nto the problem of determining the minimum possible value of the\nf\nf\nwave resistance obtainable by any dispositwn o the elements o\nan aircraft within a deJinitely prescribed region. Under the\nassumptions that the total lift and the total volume o the aircraft\nf\nare given, conditions that must be satk$ed i f the drag is to be a\nminimum are found. !Z%ereport concludes with a discussion o\nf\nrecent developments o the theory which lead to an improved\nf\nunderstanding of the drag associated with the production of lift.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe losses associated with the production of a given lift in\nfrictionless flow are generally diminished by increasing the\nmass of air entrained or influenced by the wing system. At\nthe same time, however, the loss due to friction becomes\ngreater when the exposed surface area of the wing is increased. To minimize the resultant drag we thus require a\nlifting system which effects the largest entrainment and yet\nhas the smallest exposed surface area.\nAt subsonic speeds the mass of air entrained depends only\non the lateral dimensions of the wing and is not diminished by\nconcentrating the lift within a narrow chordwise dimension.\nThe fact that a lifting line perpendicular to the direction of\nflight has such an extensive lateral influence must be considered a peculiarity of subsonic flow; it depends of course on\nthe unlimited propagation of the pressure field ahead of the\nwing. At supersonic speed the lateral entrainment begins\nonly at the foremost points of the wing surface and is confined to the interior of the rearward-sloping Mach waves from\nthis point. Finally, at extreme speeds for which Newtonian\nflow may be envisioned, the mass of air affected is limited to\nthe mass coming directly into contact with the wing, so that\nthe area of influence is simply the frontally projected area of\nthe wing.\nAnother peculiarity of the subsonic inviscid flow is the\ncomplete lack of resistance associated with the thickness of\nthe bodies or wings. At supersonic speeds, however, such a\ncomponent of drag does arise and this drag appears in the\nenergy required for the continual extension of the wave\nsystem.\nNow the problem of minimizing drag at supersonic speeds\nmay be treated mathematically in eeveral ways, depending\non the constraints adopted in the statement of the problem.\nIf, following Munk\xe2\x80\x99s problem of the minimum induced\ndrag at subsonic speeds, we impose a constraint merely on\nSUpeRedes NACA\n\nthe lift L and the span b of the wing, then we obtain the\nl\nsame value for the drag at a l Mach numbers, namely the\ninduced drag associated with the vortex wake. However,\nto achieve this value at supersonic speeds the wing would\nbe required to have an infinitely great length in the flight\ndirection so that the downward momentum associated with\nthe lift could be introduced gradually along the flight path,\nwithout appreciable wave formation.\nIn order to put the problem of drag at supersonic speeds\nin a definite form the present writer proposed (ref. 1) that\nthe outline or plan form S of the wing be adopted as a\nconstraint rather than single lengthwise or spanwise dimensions. Thus for supersonic speeds we are led to consider\nthe distribution of a given total lift L o&era specified plan\nform S in such a way as to minimize the drag D.\nIn the latter problem it is presupposed that the lifting\nsystem is confined to a plane. However, the possibility\nof favorable interference with three-dimensional arrangements of airfoils and bodies should not be averlooked.\nThus, Busemann has shown (ref. 2) that the wave drag can\nbe completely canceled by reflection between the upper and\nlower wings of a biplane. Later Ferrari (ref. 3) showed\nthat the drag of a body of revolution muld be canceled by\nthe addition of a ring airfoil to catch the wave from the\nnose and reflect it back to the tail.\nThe examples in which the wave cancellation is complete\nare, however, limited to systems in which the net lift 4\nlateral force are zero. Nevertheless, examples cited by\nFerri (ref. 4), Lomax and Heaslet (ref. 5 ) , and Graham\n(ref. 6) indicate that thg wave drag associated with the\nlift can be diminished by various three-dimensional arrangements of wings and bodies. These examples lead to a search\nfor some general statements or criteria regarding the drag\nof such three-dimensional arrangements.\nCONDITIONS FOR MINiMUM DRAG\n\nTo put the present question in a definite form it will be\nassumed the airfoils and bodies are disposed in the interior\nof a definite three-dimensional region R (see &. 1. The\n)\nregion R thus represents a geometrical constraint on the\ndimensions of the aircraft. Three-dimensional problems\nof a similar type have been considered by E. W. Graham\nand his colleagues (ref. 6) who give, for example, the o p t h u m\ndistributions of lift in spherical and ellipsoidal regions.\nHere we assume the total lift L and the volume V to be\ngiven. In a typical situation the lift L will be produced\n\nTN 3530 by Robert T.Jones. 1856.\n\n595\n\nREPORT 1335-NATIONAL\n\n-\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTIC8\n\ni\n\nW=mnstMt\n\nT=0\nax\n\n5\n\nconstant\n\nFIGURE\nI.-Conditions\n\nfor minimum drag distributions of lift and\nvolume in region R.\n\nby one or more airfoils whie the volume V will represent\nthe internal volume of one or more bodies of revolution plus\nthe volume of the wing. The region R may then be thought\nof as the region within which the parts of the aircraft may\nbe disposed so as to gain the maximum favorable interference.\nFrom a slightly different standpoint, R merely represents\nthe maximum dimensions of the aircraft. We shall be\nespecially interested in structures which minimize the\ndrag for the largest possible region, but which in themselves\noccupy only a small part of this region.\nSuppose region R together with a distribution of singularities, such as sources or lifting vortices, is given (see fig. 1).\nThen by Khrmiin and Hayes\xe2\x80\x99 cheorem (ref. 7) the drag will\nbe unchanged by a reversal of the whole system. The\ngeometry of the flow, including that of the airfoils and bodies,\nwill be changed by the reversal but the total lift and the\ntotal volume will not. The drag for either direction of flow\nmay then be computed by means of a fictitious \xe2\x80\x9ccombined\ndisturbance field\xe2\x80\x9d obtained by superimposing the disturbances in forward and reversed motion. The perturbation\nvelocities in this combined field may be denoted by:\n\n21=u\n25 =1)J+1),\n\n2E= WJ+ w,\nIt may he shown that an arrangement of sources or lifting\nelements, or their combination, which yields the minhum\ndrag is characterized by the following conditions\n\nE= constant\n\nz-constan t\n--\n\n1\n\nI\n\nthroughout R.\nI cosditions (1) are satisfied, then the integrated drag of\nf\nthe whole system will be given simply by\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side of this expression will\nbe recognized as the drag arisimg from the rearward inclimaem\ntion of the lift vector, whereas the second t r is simply the\nproduct of the volume and the constant gradient of pressure\nin the combined flow field.\nThese conditions may be verified by making use of a\n\xe2\x80\x9cmutual drag relation\xe2\x80\x9d (ref. I), essentially similar to the\nwell-known Ursell-Ward reciprocal relation, which connects\nthe drag of any two interfering distributions of singularities\nin the combined flow field. According to this relation, the\ndrag of distribution A caused by the interference of a second\ndistribution B is equal to the drag added to B by the interference of A. Now let A be a distribution within RA satisfying conditions (1). For B select a distribution having\nf\nzero total lift and zero total volume. I RB is contained\nwithin RA, then the addition of B will amount simply to a\nredistribution, without changing the given lift L or volume\nV of A. The drag of A + B may then be written i r L shorthand notation\n\n+\n\nD ( A+B)=D.u +DAB DBA\n+DEB\n(31\nThen, since by the mutual drag relation DAB=DLIA1\nthis\nequation may be written as\n\n+\n\nD(A B )=DA,t+*REA\n+DEB\n\nE)A\n\nDE,=L ~ $ + puvB(\n\nHowever, since LE and V, are both zero DBn vanides and\nthe added drag is that of distribution B alone, or DBB. Now\nthe drag of an isolated system can never be negative, hence\nD(A+B) cannot be less than D ( A ) under the conditions (1).\nOn the other hand, suppose, for example that the sidewash ZA were not zero. A distribution of lateral forces\ncould then be found which would result in a negative interference drag, dominating the quadratic term DEBt so that\n&e total drag could be reduced. Hence, if the drag of\ndistribution A actually is a minimum value, then conditions\n(1) must be complied with.\nf\nThe question o uniqueness depends on the existence of\ndistributions of type B for which the drag is zero. As shown\nby Graham, such distributious exist in three dimensions\nand hence the minimum drag corresponding to a given\nregion R may be achieved by a variety of arrangements.\nIn the case of a planar region, such as the plan form S of a\nwing, distributions of lift or volume having zero drag do not\nexist, and hence in these cases the optimum distributions are\nunique.\nd;ii a r\nSince %=-, a+ 5=-ai; and -=z2\xe2\x80\x99 be seen that conax it can\n\naz\n\nay\n\nax\n\nditions (1) do not agree with the linearized flow equation\n(1- - ~ ) & * + Z l l v + i i ; z r = O\n\nin general, but only if\n\n(6)\n\n-\n\nbU4-J\nax\n\n596\n\n(4\n)\n\nHere DBA the drag of B in the combined disturbance field\nis\nof A.

Examples such as the Busemann\n\n,\n\nLotwol force distribution\non fin,&\n\naiz\n\nbiplane satisfy the condition --0.\n\nax-\n\nIt is interesting to note that conditions analagous to E=\nconstant and 5=0 were found by Munk in connection with\nthe vortex drag of lifting systems a t subsonic speeds. In\nthat problem, the conditions apply to the twodimensional\nmotion associated with the trace of the wing system in the\nTrefftz plane. If the idea of superimposed disturbance\nfields is utilized in the subsonic problem, one finds that the\ncylindrical flow associated with the Trefftz plane emrtends\nalong the whole fiight path, including the region R. Conditions (1) thus apply at both subsonic and supersonic\nspeeds.\nMunk\xe2\x80\x99s condition of constant dowuwash and zero sidewash were used by Hemke (ref. 8) to calculate the effectiveness of end plates in reducing the vortex drag a t low speeds.\nIn such problems the condition is usually imposed by the\nstatement that the trace of the airfoil system must move\ndownward as a rigid body. It will be interesting to see\nhow this condition might be used under more general circumstances. This application is illustrated in figure 2 for\nan end plate on the tip of a wing.\nWith the wing in forward motion, the lateral velocity\nv, a t the surface of the end plate is simply the lateral slope\nof the fin surface multiplied by the stream. velocity. The\nand this condition is\ncondition iJ=O implies that v,=-v,\nobviously satisfied by keeping the geometry of the fin fixed\nwhen the flow is reversed. At the same time, however,\nrecall that the distribution of lift and lateral force must be\nkept the same in forward and reversed flow. Hence, the\nproblem of finding the optimum setting and camber for such\na fin is solved by finding that particular shape for which the\nflow is exactly reversible, that is, the lateral pressure distribution remains unchanged by a reversal of flow direction.\nAt first it seems impossible to satisfy such a requirement,\nsince, for example, the direction of the force on an inched\nsurface is usually reversed by a reversal of the direction of\nflow. However, the form of the adjacent wing surface\nmust, in general, change with the reversal, since zO#O and\nsince the lift distribution on the wing must remain unchanged.\nThen it is evident that the conditions might be satisfied if\nthe pressures on the fin surface were dominated by the wing\npressures through interference.\nRecently W. Wilmarth (ref. 9) has found several examples\nof wings with end plates which minimize the drag for certain\nprismatic regions.\nThe conditions for minimum drag are of course simply the\nresult of the constraints adopted in the initial statement of\nthe problem; and these are to a certain extept arbitrary.\nNevertheless, experience shows that the study of such\nproblems is likely to disclose essential relations in their\nclearest form.\nWith the aid of the combined flow field and the mutual\ndrag theorem, it is a relatively simple matter to extend the\n\nApl=A+; Lateral face distribution unchanged\n=\n\n-5 ;Fin geometry\n\nunchanged\n\nFIGURE\n!L-Use o condition 3=0 to determine optimum setting of\nf\nvertical fin on wing tip.\n\nconstraints in various ways. Thus in the case of a planar\nwing if both the total lift L and the spanwise loading are\nspecified, minimum drag requires that E be constsnt along\nchordwise strips, but may vary laterally. Here we have\ni\n\nZ=f(v)\n\n(8)\n\nIn case thclengthwise loading is specified we have\nZ=j(x)\n\n(9)\n\nAgain, if the first moment of the load distribution about the\naxis is specified\nE=a,+ap\n(10)\nand so on.\nI the conditions on the combined disturbance velocities\nf\nhold beyond the boundaries of the region R, then the drag\ncannot be changed by extending the distribution of lift or\nvolume into the new region. In general, this will-not be\nthe case, however, and the drag can be continually dimmished\nby increasing the dimensions of R. Thus in the case of a\nmonoplane wing a strong upwash appears beyond the wing\ntips, indicating that thb drag could be diminished by\nincreasing the span. Similarly, sidewash velocities appear\njust above and below the planar region, and the drag could\nbe reduced by extending vertical fins, or \xe2\x80\x9cfences\xe2\x80\x9d into this\nregion.\nIt must be admitted that the considerations have thus\nfar been rather abstract. A more concrete result would\nyield the actual magnitudes of the drag associated with\nvarious regions, as well as the shapes of the bodies or wings.\nAlthough no direct method of calculation has been proposed,\nnumerous examples have been found.

In this figure values of the wave drag\nobtained from exact theoretical formulas are compared\nwith the values given by the approximate expression (11).\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cexact\xe2\x80\x9d values were obtained by superimposing uniformly loaded wings of elliptical plan form and are not the\nminimum values for the resulting plan forms.\nA sufficient condition for the wave drag of a lifting system\nto have a minimum value is that all the projected loadings,\nin addition to the lengthwise loading, be elliptical.

I. Kogan has pointed out\nthat determination of the minimum drag of a lifting surface\nhaving no subsonic edges can be reduced to the solution of\nLaplace\xe2\x80\x99s equation in the two-dimensional region bounded\nexternally by the trace of the chqacteristic envelope, and\nbounded internally by the vortex trace of the Wing. In\naddition to pvv+qtl=O, the boundary condition that no\ndisturbance extend beyond the Mach cone corresponds to the\ncondition q=O on the outline of the characteristic trace; S j\n(i. e., the outer rim of the Mach envelope in fig. 1) while the\ncondition of constant downwash corresponds to q,=constant\non the vortex trace.\nThe result given by Kogan has been derived independently\nby E. W. Graham (ref. 11) and by G. N. Ward (ref. 12).\nGraham makes use of the combined flow field, and shows\nthat fields which are two-dimensional throughout the\ninterior of any given characteristic envelope, and which\nsatisfy the condition q-,=G=constant on a vortex trace\npassing through the region, can be constructed.\nSuch solutions correspond to our previous conditions (6)\nand (7) and are not restricted to wings having supersonic\nedges.\nIn Ward\xe2\x80\x99s analysis the physical flow is used, but the drag\nis calculated by using the forward-going surface of the\ncharacteristic envelope as a control surface. Since q = O\nthere in the reversed flow, it can be seen that the values of Q\nin the real flow coincide with those in the combined flow on\nthis surface. By a projection of the disturbance velocities\non this surface, Ward reduces the integral for drag to I)irichlet\xe2\x80\x99s integral, which is a minimum when the derived velocity\nfield satisfies hplace\xe2\x80\x99s equation.\nApplicstions of this method to problems involving thickness and volume have been given by M. A. Heaslet (ref. 13).\nProblems in which both the lift and $he center of pressure are\ngiven have been treated by P. Germain (ref. 14).\nThese theoretical developments provide an interesting\nintuitive picture of the drag associated with the production\nof lift a t supersonic speeds. At subsonic speeds the lifting\nwing leaves in its wake a two-dimensional, essentially incompressible downwash flow bounded internally by thc\n\nXINIMUM WA9E DRAG FOR U B I T R A R Y A\xe2\x82\xaciRANGEMENTS OF WINGS AND BODIES\n\nvortex wake, but unbounded externally. According to\nEelvin\xe2\x80\x99s theorem such an incompressible downwash flow\nsatisfying puv+pzz=O, minimizes &he kinetic energy relative to all other streamline motions satisfying the saIlie\nboundary conditions. For a given lift, (or downward\nmomentum) the kinetic energy, and hence the drag, is\nminimized when the wake moves with constant downwash.\nA t supersonic speeds we are led to consider not the flow in\nthe Trefftz plane a t infinity, but the flow in the last characteristic surface where the zone of inflnence lies entirely\nbehind the wing. The two-dimensional flow obtained by\nprojection on this surface will be limited laterally by its\nintersection with the real Mach wave, where \xe2\x80\x98p must vanish,\nand will be bounded internally by the vortex wake on the\nthe trailing edge of the wing. This flow is certainly not incompressible in general. However, if the wing is to have\nthe minimum drag consistent with the given span and with\nthe given limitations of the lateral zone of influence, then\nby Kelvin\xe2\x80\x99s theorem the flow must imitate the streamlines\nof an incompressible lateral flow in this intervening limited\nregion. For a given total lift the vortex wake should again\nmove with constant downwash.\nThe condition p=O on the rim of the characteristic\nenvelope is exactly the same as that imposed a t the boundary of an open-jet wind tunnel. Hence, we are led to compare the ection of the wing in supersonic flow with that of a\nwing in a finite jet (fig. 5 ) . Wings having small fore and\naft dimensions have a limited lateral entrainment, as shown\nby the small cross sections of their equivalent incompressible\njets (see fig. 6).\nIn Munk\xe2\x80\x99s theory of the minimum induced drag the \xe2\x80\x9carea\nof the additional apparent mass\xe2\x80\x9d associated with the vortex\ntrace of the wing plays an important role. Denoting this\narea by S,\xe2\x80\x98, we have for the drag due to lift\n\nFIGURE\n&-Effect of fore and aft dimension of wing on area of lateral\nentrainment.\n,\n\nmass of the wing in the limited jet determined by the Mach\nwaves. If the Mach number of the stream is reduced, the\nwaves become more nearly vertical and the equivalent jet\nexpands laterally, reaching an infinite cross section a t M= 1 .O.\nBelow M=1.0 the wing is operating in unlimited flow and\nwe then have:\nb2\nS,\xe2\x80\x99=r (15)\n4\nwhich leads to\n2\nD=- 2L\n\nupUZ6\xe2\x80\x98\n\nThis formula actually applies in perfect fluid flow a t all\nspeeds if S is replaced by Sm,\xe2\x80\x98, the additional apparent\n,\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\nOn the other hand, a t extremely high supersonic speeds, the\nequivalent jet contracts into a narrow space around the\nfrontal projection of the wing. In this case the streamlines\nof the downflow in the jet will be nearly straight and parallel,\nas illustrated in figure 6, and the area Sm,\xe2\x80\x99 will be substantially equal to the area of the jet S,.\nJ special cases the two-dimensioDal downflow in the\nh\ncharacteristic trace or jet S, can be readily calculated. Thus\nin the case of the elliptic wing the envelope of characteristics\nhas an elliptic cross section, with the vortex trace of the wing\nextending between the foci. Now if a flat plate moves downward (along z ) in unlimited flow, the potential at the surface\nof any confocal elliptic cylinder will be of the form p,=kzd.\nHence the boundary condition $=O may be satisfied on any\nsuch confocal ellipse by adding a uniform downwash throughout its interior so that w = -k or p= -kz.

Even if we admit only the simplest\nproperties of the fluid together with elementary\ndynamical laws for the motion, unexpectedly intricate\nmotions may appear. As examples, I may mention the\nperiodic Taylor-Gortler vortices that appear when a\nslightly viscous liquid flows over a concave surface or,\nagain, the characteristic geometrical shapes of rhe\n"patches" of turbulence that have recently been observed\nby Emmonr and Schubauer (NACA TN 3489,Sept. 1955)\nin regions of transition from laminar to turbulent\nboundary-layer flow.\nIn what is commonly understood by the term "airfoil\ntheory" we limit the range and complexity of our\ninvestigations considerably by studying particularly\nsimple flows that are apt to be of efficient service in the\nflight of an airplane. Thus in the Prandtl wing theory we\nstudy the properties of long, narrow wings, which afford\nthe highest aerodynamic efficiency at ordinary speeds\nad-which at the same time admit a mathematical simpli6cation because of their extreme proportions. Furthermore, in Prandtl\'s theory we consider only section flows\nof the Kutta- Joukowsky type.\nWith a different type of section flow, such as might be\nproduced by shakpening the leading edge, the long,\nnarrow wing loses its advantage and the dependence of\n\ndrag on aspect ratio follows more unfavorable laws. (See,\ne. g., ref. [l].)\nThe extraordinary efficiency of a well designed airfoil\n.\nin two-dimensional flow is illustrated in Fig. 1 Such an\nairfoil, of conventional form, may show a lift-to-drag\nratio of 100 to 1 or at smaller lift coefficients, a drag\ncoefficient of 0,005. The latter coefficient corresponds\nroughly to the drag of a circular cylinder having a\ndiameter %oo th of the wing chord.\n\nFig. 1\n\nAirfoil compared with circular wire having equal drag\n\nAs is well known, airfoil flows basically similar to the\nKutta-Joukowsky flow can be maintained up to very\nhigh speeds in the subsonic range. Within this range the\ndrag of the wing consists essentially of the induced drag\nand the surface friction, so that the plan form of the wing\nis determined, roughly speaking, by the criterion of\nmaximum span together with that of minimum surface\n\n*) National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, Ames Aeronautical Laboratory.\n") Paper for presentation at the meeting of GAMM.

As shown by the linear Prandtl-Glauert\ntheory, the disturbance field of a wing section expands\nvenically without limit, so that the dimensions of the\nregion of disturbance eventually become large compared\nto the chord of the wing sections. The section flow is\nthen no longer a local phenomenon but must be modified\nby the spanwise dimensions of the wing.\nIn linear theory we treat the disturbance field of a\nmoving wing by \' the approximations employed in\nacoustics.

Heft 8\n\nR. 7.]ones, Some Recent Developments in the Aerodynamics of Wings\n\'\n\nAt higher aspect ratios the values of lift and drag given\nby Guderley and Yoshihara [13] are approached.\nWhen we try to determine the disturbance field produced\nby a body or wing moving at sonic velocity we face the\ndifficulty that the form of the disturbance is not very\ndefinitely connected with the geometry of the body. At\nthis speed extensive longitudinal disturbances can travel\nalmost indefinitely without the assistance of a moving\nsolid. Hence it is perhaps not surprising that a relatively\nintense longitudinal wave is built up by a solid which\ntravels for some time at this speed. Those who have been\nin the path of the well-known "sonic boom" have had a\ndirect experience of this longitudinal wave.\nAccording to the "equivalence principle" of Oswatitsch\n[14], the potential, q, of this large-scale longitudinal\ndisturbance is determined by the longitudinal distribution\nof areas presented in planes perpendicular to the flight\ndirection. Hence, the potential at large distances reduces\nto that for an equivalent body of revolution. In\nWhitcomb\'s paper [ 151 on the "area rule" both the form\nof the wave disturbance and the incremental drag at\ntransonic speeds were shown to depend on this\ndistribution of cross-sectional area. The dependence of\nwave drag on the area distribution was given by Hayes\n[16] as a formal result of the linear theory at transonic\nspeed. In Whitcomb\'s experiments it was demonstrated\nfurther that the drag associated with the thicknesc of a\nwing can be effectively suppressed by removing an\nappropriate "area distribution" from the fuselage. With\nthese new developments it appears that wing theory at\ntransonic speeds should not be limited to the properties of\nisolated airfoils.\nAs a simple test of Whitcomb\'s drag-equivalence idea,\nSpreiter [17] has analysed the results of experiments\nmade at Ames Laboratory on rectangular airfoils having\nvarious aspect ratios and various thickness-chord ratios.\nTo maintain the same area distribution an airfoil having\na high aspect ratio and a thin section is compared with\none of lower aspect ratio but with a thicker section. For\nnonlifting wings with symmetrical sections the rule is\nverified up to aspect ratios of 3 or more. Fig. 4 shows the\ncomparison for aspect ratio 4.\n\n0\n\nI , II,\n, , 12\n,1.0,\n7\n8\n9\nMACH NUMBER\n\nFig. 4. Drag of wings having same area distribution\n\nRectangular wings of the forms shown have, of course, a\nlarge incremental drag at transonic speeds. Perhaps the\nmost effective practical method of reducing the drag at\ntransonic speeds is the use of extreme angles of sweep, thin\nsections, and slender bodies. As an illustration of the\nmagnitudes involved I would like to show drawings of\ntwo models that have been tested by the NACA (Fig. 5).\nThe two models with the relative dimensionsshown would,\naccording to the indication of our experiments, have the\nsame drag a t a slightly supersonic Mach number.\nAt the present time the calculation of three-dimensional\nwing flows at supersonic speed is carried out almost\n\nFig. 5. Models having same drag at low supersonic s p d (zero Izft)\n\nexclushely by means of the linearized theory. The\nprinciples employed in these calculations were brought\ninto sharp focus in the papers of Prandtl [18], von Kdrmdn E191 and Busernann [20] at the 1935 Volta Congress,\nwhile the f irst known application to the three-dimensional\nlifting wing appeared in Sfhlichting\'s paper of 1936 [21].\nLinearization of the flow equations brings the threedimensional wing theory within the realm of classical\nmethods of analysis and so has disclosed a variety of\ninteresting and unexpectedly *simple relations. For\nexample, if we consider a thin wing or body whose\ndisturbance field can be produced by the action of simple\nsources, then the drag of this body will be unchanged by\na reversal of the flow direction. Our attentioq was called\nto this "reversed flow" relation by von Kdrmrin and it\nwas generalized by Hayes [16] to include arbitrary\ndistributions of singularities such as lifting elements and\nsources in three-dimensions. Reversal of the now may\nchange the geometrical shapes however. In an interesting\npaper, Munk [22] has shown how such reversed flow\nrelations can be derived by considering the abstract\ndisturbance field obtained by superimposing the disturbance velocities generated by the forward motion, and\nthose generated by the reversed motion of the system.\nUtilizing this idea, Brown [23] has been able to show\nthat the lift-curve slope of a wing of any planform is\nunchanged by a reversal.\nA more general form of reversed-flow relation in steady\nwing flow theory is the reciprocal relation discovered by\nUrsell and Ward [24]. Starting with a shin lifting surface\nof planform S, we may consider the effect of warping or\ntwisting the wing in various ways, represented by\npermitting the local angle of attack a to vary with the\nposition x, y of a point on the planform. Such a warp or\ntwist a ( x , y ) will give rise to a distribution of lifting\npressure p ( x , y ) which is a linear functional of a determined by the flow equation and by the outline shape of the\nwing. Let a, and p 1 be two functions so related and let\na, and p z be a different, but similary related, pair of\ndistributions for the wing S in reversed flow; then the\nUrsell-Ward relation is\n\nFig. 6 illustrates one of the many interesting applications\nof this theorem. Here a1is taken as a constant value e ual\n3\n2\nto unity, over the whole surface, so that p1 is the distribution of lift arising when the wing as a whole is given a\nPI\n\n,a2\n\nPi\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFig. 6.

T.\n]ones, Some Recent Developments in the Aerodynamics of Wings\n\nunit angle of attadr. cc, has the value unity over a portion\nof the wing, or a flap, but has the value zero elsewhere.\npz then represents the distribution of lift over the whole\nwing, resulting from the deflection of a flap. The\nreciprocal relation then tells us that the l i t on the wing\ndue to deflecting the flap is equal to the lift on the flap\ndue to deflecting the wing with the flow reversed. This\nrelation is applicable at both subsonic and supersonic\nspeeds. The extension to airfoils in unsteady motion has\nbeen given by Flax [25] and by Heuslet and Spreiter [26]\nwho point out its connection with classical reciprocal\ntheorems of Helmholtz, Maxwell, and Ruyleigh.\nIt is interesting to note that extension of the reciprocal\ntheorem to nonstationary motion provided a means for\nverifying the coincidence between Kuessner and Sears\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x9cgust lift functions\xe2\x80\x9c and Wagner\xe2\x80\x99s function describing\nthe growth of circulation around an airfoil starting from\nrest for wings in three-dimensional flow.\nA classical problem in the theory of airfoils is the\ndetermination of the form of the wing or the distribution\nof lift for minimum drag. Thus we may think of Munk\xe2\x80\x99s\nproblem of the minimum \xe2\x80\x9cinduced\xe2\x80\x9c drag for a given\ntotal lift L and a given span b [27]. At supersonic speeds\nwe have to consider in addition to the induced drag a\nwave drag which depends in a rather complex way on the\ndistribution of lift over the whole surface. Surprisingly\nenough, however, we find a continual recurrence of ideas\nderived from this earlier problem in our studies of wave\ndrag of lifting surfaces at supersonic speeds.\nI n Munk\xe2\x80\x99s problem it was found that minimum drag\noccurs when the \xe2\x80\x9cinduced downwash* is constant at all\npoints of the span. To extend these considerations to\nsupersonic speeds we find it essential to specifiy not\nmerely the span, but the plan form of the wing [28]. By\nmaking use of the reversibility theorem we are able to\nexpress the drag in terms of a fictitious disturbance field,\nobtained by combining linearly the disturbances produced\nby a given distribution of lift in forward and in reversed\nmotion. The mean downwash W,obtained by averaging\nat each point the values in forward and reverse flow, then\ntakes the place of the \xe2\x80\x9cinduced downwash\xe2\x80\x9c and is\nquantitatively equal to the latter if the speed is subsonic.\nThe drag is obtained by integrating over the plan form S the\nproduct of the local lifting pressure A p and themean angle\ni\nof attack i = G/V. With a given total lift L and a given\nplan form S the minimum drag occurs when the mean\ndownwash G has the same value a t all points of S. This\nresult holds whether the speed is subsonic or supersonic.\n\nFig. 1. Conditions for minimum drag: distributions of hft and volume\ni region R\nn\n\n606\n\nIt is interesting to note that the idea of superimposing the\nforward and reversed disturbance fields was utilized in\nMunk\xe2\x80\x99s original proof of the so-called stagger theorem.\nIf we accept the idea of a combined supersonic disturbance field, then the necessary conditions for minimum\nresistance can be generalized to include interfering\ndistributions of lift and volume in three-dimensional\nregions. Here we may think of an arrangement of airfoils\nor lifting elements in space, but limited to the interior of\na region R. If the total lift L and the region R are given\nthen the minimum drag occurs when (see Fig. 7)\nW = const, 6 = 0\nthroughout R. The value of the minimum drag is then\n\n(9)\n\nDmin = L W / K\nThe computation of the drag of interfering lift distributions is simplified by a reciprocal relation, essentially\nsimilar to the Ursell-Ward relation, which appears in\nthe combined flow field. Thus if we consider any two\ndistributions of lift represented by 1, ( x , y, z ) and lb ( x , y, z)\nthen we may write in short-hand notation:\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nDab\n\n=&a\n\nor, in words, \xe2\x80\x9cthe drag of a caused by the (combined)\ndisturbance field of b is equal to the drag of b caused by\nthe (combined) disturbance field of a.\xe2\x80\x9c\nIn view of this, we may write for the total drag\n\nD ( u 4- b) = Daa f 2 D b a f Dbb.\n(12)\nNow suppose that 1, satisfies conditions (9) and suppose\nthat Rb lies entirely within R,. Then\n(13)\n\nDoa = Lb E$v\n\nwith\n(14)\ne \xe2\x80\x99 = const = Da$L,,\n&\nso that the total drag, including the interference, is given\n\nby\n(15)\nD (a f b) = Daa ( I f &/La) -k Dbb.\nAs is well known, the elliptical spanwise distribution of\nlift yields the minimum, drag for a monoplane wing at\nsubsonic speeds. In our studies of minimum drag at\nsupersonic speeds we have found that the closest\nconnection with the theory for subsonic speeds can be\nmaintained if we employ a special method for the\ncalculation of drag. In this method [29] we make use of\nHayes\xe2\x80\x99 idea of equivalent positions of sources or lifting\nelements, together with the idea of the combined\ndisturbance field. Following this method, the combined\ndisturbance field of a lifting surface is constructed by the\nsuperposition of infinitely many plane waves, all lying at\nthe Mach angle, but at varying angles 0 around the flight\naxis ( x axis). At each angle 0 we construct an equivalent\n\xe2\x80\x9clifting line\xe2\x80\x9c by integrating the lift distribution in the\ndirection parallel to these planes. A sufficient condition\nfor the wave drag to be a minimum is that each equivalent\nlifting line be elliptically loaded. I find it quite surprising\nthat the elliptic loading appears again in the problem of\nminimum drag at supersonic speeds, although von Klrmln and Busemann have already noticed a similar\nconnection with the wave drag of bodies of revolution.\n\nWith a wing of elliptic plan form the minimum drag\noccurs when the lift L is distributed uniformly over the\n\n4 ( s 8 A.T.Jones, Some Recent Developments in the Aerodynamics of Wings\nIHeft ,\n)\n\n2. f.\n\nsurface. In this case integration of the surface loading in\nany oblique direction yields an elliptically loaded lifting\nline, as shown by Fig. 8. Since the spanwise loading is\nelliptic, the induced drag or vortex drag is also a\nminimum.\n\nLINES X = CONST, 2.0\nOS%-z S I N 8\n\nLIFTING SURFACE\n\ni\n\ni\n\nFig. 8. Integratlon of surface loading alonq Mad2 planes\n\nThe assumption that the integrated loading for ea& angle\n0 is elliptical can be used to derive a lower bound for the\nwave resistance associated with a given total lift and a\nregion R. This formula is illustrated in Fig. 9. For the\nminimum vortex drag under these conditions we may\nrefer to Munk\'s original paper [ 2 7 ] .\nMACH PLANE\n\nproblems involving the optimum distribution of .~.i&ess\nor volume within a region R or a plan form S.\nFollowing along the lines of the previous discussion, we\nsuppose that a region R is given and also a certain volume\nY to be contained in slender, closed bodies or airfoils\nwithin R. The condition for minimum drag is then that\nthe pressure gradient, proportional to a z / a n , in the\ncombined flow field be constant. Since the total drag is\nobtained by integrating the product of the local pressure\ngradient over the volume, we may say that minimum\ndrag for z given volume occurs when the drag per unit\nvolume is constant thro6ghout the region. It must be\nrememb\'ered, however, that the distribution of drag\nimplied in this statement refers to the fictitious\ndisturbance field obtained by averaging the forward and\nthe reversed disturbances.\nThe drag of interfering bodies and airfoils in threedimensional regions has been discussed in a recent paper\nby Graham, Beane, and Licher [ 3 0 ] . For nonliting\nsystems the wave drag can always be reduced to zero by\nreflections within the system as, in Ferrari\'s well-known\nexample of a shrouded body, or the Buseman72 biplane.\nThe projectile shapes of won Kirmrin [ 7 , Sears [31],\n1]\nand Haack [32] satisfy the condition 3ji/an = const\nthroughout the region R determined by-the interior of the\n"double Mach cone- with vertices at the nose and the t i .\nal\nIn this case, of course, the drag is only a relative minimum.\nHowever, it is interesting to see how we may simplify the\ncomputation of interference drag in such cases as\nillustrated in Fig. 11. I n this example we start with a\n\nFig. 9. Lower bound for wave drag associated with the region R\nand the lift L\n\nFor a region R lying everywhere close to the x axis at the\ncenter of the Mach cone, the loadings integrated along\nMach planes will all be similar to a "lengthwise loading"\nobtained by integrating the lift over planes x = const.\nIf this loading is ellipticar, we may write for the wave\ndrag\n\nFor wider wings the deviation from this value can be\ntaken into account by a factor K. Values of K for several\n0\ndifferent plan forms are shown in Fig. 1 .\n\n2Dac=2%\n\nSEARS-HAACK BODY\n\nFig. 11. Use of combined disturbance fields in calculating\nwing-body drag\n\nplanar source distribution, or a nonliiting wing "a", and\nintroduce a linear distribution of sources along the central\naxis, denoted by "cy. For the drag of this combination we\nmay write\n(17)\nD (a i c ) = D,,\nZD,,\nD,,,\nwhere D a , is the drag of the wing in the combined\ndisturbance field of the linear source distriburion. Now\nif the combined disturbance field of the linear source\ndistribution satisfies the condition a @ x = const, as in\nthe case of a Sears-Haah body, it will do so throughout\nthe interior of its double Mach cone. Furthermore, by\nmaking this source distribution sufficiently long, the wing\ncan be contained entirely within this region.

By\nadopting an approximate relation between the source strength\nand. the geomety of a wing-body combination, the wave-drag\ntheory is expressed in &rms ineolving the areas intercepted by\noblique planes or Mach planes. The resulting formulas are\nchecked by comparison with the drag measurements obtained in\nwind-tunnel expeTiments and in experiments withfalling models\nin free air. Finally, a theory for determining mig-body\nshaps o j minimum drag at supersonic Mach numbers is\ndiscussed and some prelimimry experiments m e reported.\nDISCUSSION\n\nAt subsonic speeds the pressure drag arising from the thicknew of the body or wings is negligible so long as the shapes are\nsufficiently well streamlined to avoid flow separation. I n\nthat range there exists no possibility of either favorable or\nadverse interference on the pressure distributions themselves.\nIf one body is so placed as to receivc a drag from the pressure\nfield of another then the second body is sure to iweive a\nrorrcsponding increment of thrust from the first.\nAt supersonic speeds this tolrrance, wliich was permit ted\nthe designer, disappears, and thc drag becomrs sensitive to\nthe shape and aii*angement of the bodics. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99o be sure, the\nprimary factor here is the thickness ratio, but nevertheless\nthere exist arrangements in wliich a large cancellation of drag\noccurs, Examples of thelatter are: the sweptback wing and\nthe Busemann biplane.\nRecently R. T. Whitcomb (ref. 1) has shown how the drag\nat transonic speeds may he reduced to a surprising extent by\nsimply cutting out a portion of the fuselage to compensate\nfor the area blocked by the wing. The purpose of the present\npaper is to discuss some of the theoretical aspects of this\nf\nmethod o drag reduction and to show how the basic idea\nmay be extended to higher speeds in the supersonic range.\nWbitcomb\xe2\x80\x99s deduction of the \xe2\x80\x9carea rule\xe2\x80\x9d was based on\nconsiderations o stream-tube area and the phenomenon of\nf\n\xe2\x80\x9cchoking\xe2\x80\x9d-which follow from one-dimensional-flow theory.\nEach individual stream tube of a threedimensional-flow field\nmust obey the law of one-dimensional flow. Whiie we cannot actually determine the three-dimensional field on this\nbasis alone, nevertheless it provides a good starting point for\nour thinking. The results demonstrate again the effectiveness of basic and simple considerations.\nI\n\nWhile onedimensional-flow theory thus ppovides a clue\nto the area rule, the necessary principle appears more specifically in the three-dimensional-flow theory. Thus, the\nlormdas for wave drag given by linear theory, if followed\ntoward the limit as M approaches 1.0 (from above), show\nthat the wave drag o a system of wings and bodies depends\nf\n3olely on the longitudinal area distriboliorr of the system as a\nwhole. This was fmt noted by W. D. Hayes in his 1946\nthesis (ref. 2). However, because of the h i t a t i o n s of the\ntheory at transonic speeds, this result was not thought to be of\npractical significance. Later G. N. Ward (ref. 3), E . W.\nGraham (ref. 4 ,and others, restricting themselves to very\n)\nnaxrow shapes, expressed the wave drag in terms of the\nlongitudinal area distribution for Mach numbers above\n1.0, where the linear theory has a better iustification.\nIt should be noted, however, that both of the problems\ncited are limiting cases of the more general problem of supersonic drag and it should be borne in mind that only in certain\ncases has it been possible to rrdurr thr geiiernl theoretical\nformulas to the form of an awn rule. It can be shown that\nthe flow field about arq- system o bodies inn!- br ereateti by n\nf\nrrrtain distribution of soourcc~and sinks over t,he surfaces\nof thr bodies.

T o obtain a formula for the wavt\ndrag in t e r m of mpa distributions we have to adopt n simplified relation between the source strrngtli and the geometry\nof the bodies, namely, that the source strength is proportional\nto the normal component of the stream velocity a t the body\nsmtace. There are examples (e. g., Busemann biplanes and\nducted bodies) for whicli this assumption is not valid. If,\non the other hand, we limit ourselves to thin symmetrical\nwings mounted on vertically symmetrical fuselages, there are\nindications that a good estimate of the wave drag a t supersonic speeds can be obtained on the bask of the simplified\nrelation assumed.\nFollowing Hayes\xe2\x80\x99 method of calculation, we find that a t\nM= 1.0 the expression for the wave drag of a system of wings\nand bodies reduces to KBrmin\xe2\x80\x99s well-known formula (ref. 6)\nfor the wave drag of a slender body of revoIutioii, that is,\n\nHere S(X) represents the total cross-sectional area intercepted by a plane perpendicular to the stream at the station\n\nBupersedesIiACA RM A53NlPa by Robert T Junes, I\xc2\xb6%.\n.\n$9481-7\n\n611\n\n,\n\nREPORT 1284-NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\n.b\n\nz=z,cos\n\nand\n%(z) =2A,sin n+\nwe obtain for the wave resistance\np\nD=-7 r8v 2 ZnA,2\n\nOf all the terms of the series, each contributes to the drag,\nbut only A and A, contrihutc to the volume or the base\nI\narea of the systeni. \xe2\x80\x98rhus, to achieve a small drag with a\ngiven base area, or with a giveii over-all volumr within tho\ngiven leiigth, Lliu higher harmonics iii tlic ciirvc S\xe2\x80\x99(s)should\nbe supprcssed.

By assigning different valucs\nto A whilc kccpiiig 8 constarit, we obtain a series of parallcl\n\nTEIEORY O F WING-BODY DRAG AT SUPERSONIC SPEEDS\n\nplanes at the same angle 0 around the z axis. By assigning\ndifferent values to 8 while keeping X a constant, we obtain\na set of planes enveloping that Mach cone whose apex lies\nat the point X = z .\nSelecting a value of 8, we cut through the wivg-body\nsystem with a series of planes corresponding to different\nvalues of X . The total intercepted area in each plane is\nthen equated to the area intercepted by this plane passing\nthrough the equivalent body of revolution. If we denote\nthe area intercepted obliquely by dX,8), then the area\nS(X,e) is defined by\nS = s sin p\nwhere p is the Mach angle (i. e., sin p = l / M ) . Thus, S is\nthe area intercepted by normal planes passing through the\nequivalent body of revolution on the assumption that this\nbody is slender. Again, we write\n\ns\xe2\x80\x99(x,e)=,x\n\nb\n\nS(X,O)=ZA, sin n p\n\nwith\n\nX\n\ncos p=X\nO\nHere, however, both the length 2X0 and the shape of the\nequivalent body vary with the angle 8. The drag of each\nequivalent body of revolution, which we may denote by\nD\xe2\x80\x98 (e) is then determined by applying Sears\xe2\x80\x99 formula:\n\nS(x)\xe2\x80\x99.A, sin2\n(Seors-Haack\n\nFIGURE\n3.-Optimurn\n\nbody)\n\narea distribution for given length and volume.\n\nTo check the agreement between these theoretical formulas\nfor the wave drag and experiment.al values, we have compared our calculations with the results of tests made by\ndropping models from a high altitude. This comparison\nwas made by George H. Holdaway of Ames Laboratory who\nsupplied the accompanying illustration (fig. 4). I n some of\nthese cases it was found necessary to retain more than 20\nterms of the Fourier series in order to obtain a convergentj\nexpression for the drag.\nConsidering the variety of the shapes represented here, the\nagreement is certainly as good as we ought to expect from\nour linear simplifications. The agreementjs naturally better\nin those interesting cases in which the drag is small.\n\n-Theory\n---- Experiment\n\nThe total drag of the wing-body system is the average of all\nthese values between O=O and 8=2r, that is,\n\nD=$\n\nD\xe2\x80\x99(8)d8\n\nI n general, the coefficients A , will be functions of the angle\nof projection e. However, calculation shows that the first\ntwo coefficients A , and A, are again related in a simple wa\\r\nto the base area and the volume v. Thus,\n\nA,=-2 2\nS(X)\na x\no\n\nNone of the higher coefficients contribute to the base area\nof volume, but they invariably contribute to the drag.\nThe rules for obtaining a low wave drag now reduce to\nthe rule that each of the equivalent bodies obtained by the\noblique projections should be as smooth and slender as\npossible, the \xe2\x80\x9csmoothness\xe2\x80\x9d again being related to an absence\nof higher harmonics in the series expression for S\xe2\x80\x98(X). Thus\ni n the case of given length and volume the series should\ncontain only the term A2 sin 2p (see fig. 3). It should be\nnoted that in this theory, the equivalent bodies of revolution\ndo not have a physical significance. The concept is simply\nan aid in visualizing the magnitude of the drag of the complete system.\n\nM\nFIGURE\n4.-Comparison\n\nof theory with results of Arnes Laboratory\ndrop tests.\n\nFigure 5 shows an analysis of one of Whitcomb\xe2\x80\x99s experiments. The linear theory, of course, shows the transonic\ndrag rise simply as a step a t M=1.0. We may expect such\na variation to be approached more closely as the thickness\nvanishes. To represent actual values here a nonlinear\ntheory would be needed. For many purposes it will be sufficient to estimate roughly the width of the transonic zone by\nconsiderations such as those given in reference 9. In the\npresent case it will be noted that agreement with the linear\ntheory is reached a t Mach numbers above about 1.08, and\nthe linear theory clearly shows the effect of the modification.\nFor further theoretical studies of wing-body drag, shapes\nhave been selected which are especially simple analytically,\nnamely, the Sears-Haack body and biconvex wings of elliptic\n\n394915-57-2\n\n613\n\nREPORT 1284--NATIONAL\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nplan form, having aspect ratios of 2.54 and 0.635. Figure 6\nshows the effect of wing proportions on the variation\nof wave drag with Mach number, both with and without the\nWhitcomb modification. In each case the modification has\nthe effect of reducing the wave drag to that of the body\nalone a t M=1.0. I n the case of the low-aspect-ratio wing\nthis drag reduction remains effective over a considerable\nrange of higher Mach numbers. With the higher aspect\nratio, however, the drag increases sharply a t higher speeds,\nso that a t A4= 1.6 the modification nearly doubles the wave\ndrag.\nThe rapid increase of drag in the case of the high-aspectratio wing is, of course, the result of the relatively abrupt\ncurvatures introduced into the fuselage lines by the cutout.\nSuch abrupt cutouts are necessarily associated with wings\nhaving small fore and aft dimensions, that is, unswept wings\nof high aspect ratio.\nThese considerations led to the problem of determining a\nfuselage shape for such wings that is better adapted to the\nhigher Mach numbers. The first step in this direction is,\nobviously, simply to lengthen the region of the cutout-thus\navoiding the rapid increase of drag with Mach number. The\nproblem of actually determining the best shape for the fuselage cutout a t any specified Mach number has been under-\n\nP-Mach d o n e\n\n0\n\n77\n\ny,\ns,sin,u\n\nFIGURE\n7.-Design\n\n271\n\n9\n\nas,\n\n= - q27Ts,dq\n27 0\n7\n\nof fuselage modification for specified Mach number.\n\ntaken by Harvard Lomax and Max. A. Heaslet a t Ames\nLaboratory (ref. 10). Their solution of this problem provides\na definite method for determining the distribution of sources\nand sinks along the fuselage axis that will achieve a minimum\nvalue of the drag for a given wing shupe a t any specified\nMach number. Furthermore, by admitting singularities of\nhigher order-quadrupoles, etc., which would distort the\nrotational symmetry of the fuselage, they have been able to\nshow that the wave drag of a wing-body system can be\nreduced, in principle a t least, to a minimum value associated\nwith the given overall length and volume of the system, that\nis, t,o the value for a simple Sears-Haack body containing the\nwhole volume of the system.2\nBy adopting our simplified relation between the source\nstrength and the body shape, we may describe the result of\nthis theory by a relatively simple concept, which is illustrated\nin figure 7. For modifications of the first type, the problem\nis to determine the area AS, to be removed from the fuselage\nto best compensate for a given wing. (See fig. 7.) Selecting\na station along the fuselage axis and a Mach plane passing\nthrough this station, we revolve this plane around the axis,\nmeasuring a t each angle $ the normal projection, or frontal\nprojection, of the area intercepted where the plane cuts\nthrough the wing., After plotting these areas against $ and\nintegrating between 0 and 27r, we obtain AS, z1s the average\nof the values of S,. At any Mach number the total volume\nto be subtracted from the fuselage is equal to the wing volume. At higher Jlach numbers, since the modification extends over a greater length, the area subtracted a t individual\ncross sections becomes less.\nFigure\xe2\x80\x98 8 shows the calculated result of designing the\nfuselage cutout for a specific Mach number, 1.2 in this case.\nThe lower\xe2\x80\x99curve is an envelope showing the minimum values\nthat can be achieved by such a radially symmetric cutout.\nFigure 9 shows the magnitude of the gain that is theoretically possible by higher order modifications of the fuselage\nshape.

Thus Ihe additional drag of an\nairfoil R placed within the double cone of the fuselage will be\ngiven by\nDaa=~,Dbb\n(-47)\nvb\n\nS\xe2\x80\x99(X)=A2sin 2q\n\n(-42)\n\nand the drag has a minimum value for the given volume and\nlength. The value of the drag is given b y\n\nNow, by the mutual drag theorem (ref. 13) we have\n\nDa,=Db.z\n\nor, \xe2\x80\x9cthe drag of the fuselage caused by the presence of the\nwing is equal to the drag of the wing caused by the presence\nof the fuselage.\xe2\x80\x9d I n this way we obtain the general formula\n\nD(ai-b)=Dbbi-2DabfD,,\nThe elliptic wing has symmetrical biconvex sections, with\nordinates z given by\n\nwhere a and b are the semiaxes. The area distribution for\n.;very angle of projection is similar to that of the Sears-Haaclr\nbody, but the projected length varies with the angle. The\nwing thus yields a minimum value of the wave drag consistent\nwith a given volume and the elliptic plan form. The value\nof this drag is:\n\nwhere S is the plan area of the wing.\nBy making use of the reversal theorem for drag we may\ncompute the wave drag of any body from the fictitious\npressure field obtained by superimposing the perturbation\nvelocities for forward and reversed motion (refs. 12 and 13).\nThis process leads to some interesting relations for the shapes\nselected. \xe2\x80\x98Thus in the case of the Sears-Haack body it may\nbe shown that the combined pressure distribution consists\nof a uniform gradient of pressure over the whole interior R\nof its \xe2\x80\x9ccharacteristic envelope\xe2\x80\x9d defined by the Mach cone\nfrom the nose together with the reversed Mach cone from\nthe tail. (See fig. 11.)\nBy thinking of the characteristic region R as a region of\nuniform horizontal buoyancy, and of the body b in terms of a\ncertain volume, v b , we see that the drag is simply the product\n\n\xe2\x80\x99(a) Body of revolution.\n(b) Elliptic wing.\n\nFIGURE 1.-Characteristic envelopes.\n1\n\n6 16\n\n(A81\n\n(A91\n\nTHEORY O F WING-BODY DRAG AT SUPERSONIC SPEEDS\n\nNow, the combination (a+c) may be placed inside the characteristic region of the body b without interference, since\nva+v,=O.\nHence,\n\nand for the special shapes selected:\n\nThe effect of an indentation or cutout in the fuselage may\nbe calculated by introducing a second \xe2\x80\x9cbody,\xe2\x80\x9d e, shorter\nthan the fuselage, and having a negative volumc cqual to the\nvolume subtracted by tlie indentation. 111 order to simplify\nthe situation as much as possible it. will be ussumcd that the\nwing lies entirely withiii the characteristic region of the\nindentation, and furthermore that the latter may be represented by a \xe2\x80\x9cnegative\xe2\x80\x9d Scars-Hawk body with volurnc equal\nto that of the wing.\nSears-Hoock body;\nNegative volume\n\nD(a+ b+c) =Dan+LA!,--D,,\n\n(A12)\n\nThis formula yields the minimum drag for the shapes selected\nunder the assumption that v B t c is fixed.

T. JONES* AND M. D. VAN DYKE*\nAmes Aeronautical Laboratory, NACA\nSnnraraRY\n\nIt is shown that the drag of any semi-infinite airfoil section in\npurely subsonic inviscid flow follows precisely the PrandtlGlauext compressibility rule. The result for the parabola has\napplication to leadmg-edge corrections in thin airfoil theory.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nBODIES have long been used to represent the noses of elongated aerodynamic shapes.\nThis role assumes increased importance in compressible\nflow, because the approximate linearized theory must\nusually be employed, and it breaks down in the neighborhood of stagnation points.\xe2\x80\x99 It can be corrected,\nhowever, if the flow is known past a simple semiinfinite shape (such as a parabola) that matches the\nactual body near its nose.2 Except in incompressible\nflow, the semi-infinite shape itself cannot be treated\nexactly, but only by another approximation such as\nthe Janzen-Rayleigh method. However, it is shown\nin the present paper that for the drag itself the effect\nof compressibilityis known exactly.\n\nS\n\nEMI-INFINITE\n\nDRAG A PAFL~BOLA\nOF\nIN SUBSONIC\nFLOW\n\nAs discussed by Prandtl and Tietjerqathe drag of a\nsemi-infinite body in inviscid flow is understood to be\nthe limit of the pressure drag on a finite section isolated\nby a transverse slit into which the surrounding pressure penetrates (see Fig. 1). With this definition, the\ndrag (per unit span) of an infinite parabolic cylinder in\nincompressible flow along its axis is UR times the dynamic pressure, R being the nose radius.\nAs the free-stream Mach Number increases to any\nvalue short of uriity, the entire flow field remains sub.sonic and hence free of shock waves, because a parabola exerts only a retarding iduence on the flow.\nLocal pressures do not, of course, follow the PrandtlGlauert compressibility rule even approximately near\nthe stagnation point. Nevertheless, the particular\nweighted average of surface pressures that yields the\ndrag does obey that rule exactly. Thus, at any freestream Mach Number EA less than unity, the drag is\n\nD\n\nairfoil (say, a symmetrical Joukowski section) of thickness r . I the leading edge is analytic, it has a nose\nf\nradius proportional to r2. Now suppose the airfoil\ndivided into a short nose section of length r and a remaining tail section (see Fig. 2), and consider the contribution of each to the total drag. The drag vanishes\nas r approaches zero, but the drag coefficient remains\nfinite if referred to a length of order r2, such as the nose\nradius. The nme section disappears in the same limit;\nbut if it is magnified so that its nose radius remains\nconstant, it approaches an infinite parabola.\nOver the rear section the slope is uniformly small, so\nthat the linearized theory becomes exact in the limit,\ngiving a drag coefficient proportional td (1 - M2)-(\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d)\nOver the nose section linearized theory cannot be applied. However, if the flow is purely subsonic, the\ntotal drag is zero according to Theodorsen\xe2\x80\x99s extension\nto subsonic flow of d\xe2\x80\x98Alembert\xe2\x80\x99s paradox.\xe2\x80\x98 Hence\nthe drag of the nose also varies as (1 - M2)-(\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x992).\nThe same compressibility rule holds for the wellknown leading-edgesuction force associated with angle\nof attack. This is clear from a repetition of the preceding argument with the airfoil considered t o have an\nangle of,attack a! that tends to zero in proportion to the\nthickness r. In the limit we obtain asymmetric flow\npast an infinite parabola (see Fig. 3). One cannot\nspeak of the angle of attack, because the slope of all\nstreamlines tends toward zero far upstream, decaying\nfinally like [ s ~ / ( - x ) ] \xe2\x80\x9d ~where SO is some characteristic\nlength. However, one, can instead characterize the\ndegree of asymmetry of the flow field far upstream by\nspecifying t h i s parameter SO in the dimensionless form\nso/R.

For the solid body this value would rise\nwith Mach Number as (1 - W)-(\'/\')\nuntil the speed\nof sound was attained on the surface.\nFurthermore, the proof indicates that the rule applies\nas well to a semi-infinite body that ultimately grows\nmore slowly or more rapidly than a parabola. However, a body has zero drag if it grows more slowly and\n$ b i t e drag if it grows more rapidly. Hence only the\ndividing case of a body asymptotic to a parabola provides a signiscant result.\nSimilar considerations could be applied to a threedimensional semi-infinite body-for example, a body of\nrevolution. However, the significant shape that separates axisymmetric bodies of zero and infinite drag\nhas been found by Gurevich8 to be a peculiar one whose\nradius varies asymptotically as x\'/\'(ln x)-("~). AS in\nplane flow, its ultimate form must be the same as that\nof the dead-water region in axisymmetric free-streamline flow, for which Levinsong has indeed found the\nsame form. For a body of noncircular cross section,\nm c e the drag depends only on the +ape f a r downstream, where slender body theory becomes accurate,\nthe area rule shows that the drag depends only on the\ncross-sectional area. Hence, any three-dimensional\nsemi-infinite body having finite drag in subsonic flow\ngrows with cross-sectional area ultimately proportional\nto x(1n x ) -(I").\n\n+\n\nk-T-4\nFIG. 2.

Then for a fixed flow pattern far upstream, corresponding to constant SO, the drag of a\nparabola is given by\n\nD\n\n=\n\n(1/2)pU2[r(R s o ) / d I\n-\n\n-W]\n\n(2)\n\nThis rule now holds only below the critical Mach Number, which is less than Unity for asymmetric flow. At\nspeeds above the critical Mach Number, local supersonic zones appear which undoubtedly terminate in\nshock waves, and these invalidate the extended d\'Alembert paradox on which the argument rests. It may be\nnoted in Eq. (2) that even in nonlinear flow the drag\nterms are additive.\nThe rule provides an integral check on detailed approximate solutions. For example, Imai6 has calculated the Janzen-Rayleigh expansion in powers of W\nfor the surface speed on a parabola in symmetric flow,\nretaining terms in M4. Carrying out the complicated\nintegration for the drag gives\n\nD/(1/2)pU27rR = 1\n\n+ ( l / 2 ) M 2+ (3/S)M4+ . . . (3)\n\nThis is just the expansion to order M4 of the Prandtlso\nGlauert factor (1 - M2)-(1/2), that Imai\'s approximation is in accord with the present rule.

At supersonic\nspeeds such phenomena show a greater and more interesting variety. Search\nfor the minimum number of guiding principles of design thus becomes more\ndiflicdt and more dangerous.\nStudies which can cover an adequate range of geometrical form are at present\nlimited to the linearized version of aerodynamic theory. Such studies, especially\nthose by variational methods, have disclosed certain basic principles of design for\naerodynamic efficiency. In present-day experiments, however, the indicated\ntrends are rather quickly confronted with effects of viscosity and nonlinearities.\nWhile the theory indicates that good values of aerodynamic efficiency are possible\nat supersonic speeds it is not yet clear how closely these expectations may be\napproached in practice.\nIn the present paper several arrangements of supporting surfaces and bodies\nare discussed and in some cases comparisons of theory and experiment are made.\nFinally, certain phenomena connected with lift and drag in a rarefied medium\nare considered briefly.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nINits earlier development the subsonic airplane showed a great variety\nin the arrangement of airfoils, bodies, and other parts. For the past 15\nor 20 years, however, those airplanes which have passed the tests of\nexperience have shown little alteration in basic form. The aerodynamic\nprinciples which have determined this form seem now to be well understood and agreed upon.\nThe situation is different in the case of the supersonic airplane. Here\nthe aerodynamic rules seem more complex. No clear direction toward\na specific form is evident. Our theoretical investigations have taken a\nrather wide range-seeming in some cases rather far removed from\npractical questions.\nI n the present paper we shall review some of the recent theoretical\nand experimental work in supersonic aerodynamics with its practical\napplication in mind.\n*Aeronautid Research Scientist\n\n-r.\n\n627\n\nAerodynamic Design for Supersonic Speeds\n\nCOMPONENTS O F DRAG\n\nWhen considering the drag of a complete airplane it is natural to\nsimplify our thinking by dividing the drag into components according to\ndifferences in origin. One possibility here is to assign a drag to the individual parts of the airplane and then allow for a certain \xe2\x80\x9cinterference\xe2\x80\x9d\nbetween the various components. This scheme is not completely satisfactory at supersonic speeds since the individual drags often tend to be\noutweighed by the interference. A somewhat more satisfactory division\nassociates a component of the drag with lift-producing elements, elements\nof volume or thickness, and a component of surface friction. Here again\nthe interference must not be discounted and it is necessary to guard against\nthe acceptance of any such division as having a fundamental significance.\nThus the division of drag according to normal pressure and skin\nfriction or \xe2\x80\x9ctangential pressure\xe2\x80\x9d seems a natural one, and yet situations\narise in which this convention is not appropriate. In the case of a cooled\nbody in a rarefied gas stream the resultant stress acts nearly in the stream\ndirection, independently of the inclination of the surface. Here the\nresultant affords a simpler description than any of its components.\nIf we accept tentatively the division according to lift, volume, and\nsurface area, then it is possible to trace the variation in the relative magnitude of these items as the Mach number increases. The range of low\nsupersonic speeds is characterized by the development of large pressures\non surfaces having a small inclination. Thus the drag due to thickness\nor volume is relatively large in comparison with the drag due to lift. At\nthe same time any disturbance causes an extensive lateral influence, giving\nrise to pronounced interference effects. The surface friction is, however,\nhardly changed from its subsonic value, provided the increased tendency\ntoward separation can be avoided.\nAt higher speeds the Mach waves bend back so that the zone of influence\nis contracted laterally into a smaller space around the body. The pressure\ndeveloped by a given surface inclination becomes smaller in proportion\nto the dynamic pressure. For this reason the drag associated with the\nthickness is reduced. To support a given lift the wing must have a larger\nangle of attack, so that the drag due to lift is increased. The friction coefficient with either laminar or turbulent flow diminishes, but not as\nrapidly as the normal pressure.\nThe drag arising from the volume of the wings or bodies is most pro..\nnounced at low supersonic speeds near M = 1 0 For airplanes intended\nl\nto fy in this range a proper distribution of volume according to the area\nrule is important. As in the case of the lift distribution, however, our\nstudies have shown that the minimum of the drag is not a sharp minimum,\nbut there exist many smooth shapes near the optimum which have essentially the minimum drag. From the designer\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint the influence\nof the over-all proportions is perhaps the dominant influence, the wave\n\n6 28\n\nROBERTT.\nJONES\n\ndrag being reduced most effectively, of course, by extending the volume\nin the flight direction.\nM I N I M U M DRAG O F L I F T I N G SURFACES\n\nIn the problem of minimum drag, as previously considered by the present\nwrite+), the plan form of the wing is assumed to be given as well as the\ntotal lift. The result provides a certain unification of subsonic and supersonic airfoil theories through the artifice of a \xe2\x80\x9ccombined flow field\xe2\x80\x9d. By\nconsidering this problem from a different point of view, M. N. Kogan(2)\nhas recently given a derivation in which the significant quantities seem\nto have a closer relation to the physical phenomena. Rather than consider \xe2\x80\x99\na reversed motion of the wing, Kogan utilizes the reversed Mach wave\nas a control surface in applying the momentum theorem to the calculation\nof drag. As a result of this choice, the expression for the drag reduces to\nthe Dirichlet integral of the local disturbance velocities projected on this\nsurface. Thus\n\nwhile the lift is given by\n\nHere yg and \xe2\x80\x98pz are the y and z components of the disturbance velocity\nafter projection on the characteristic surface\nThe lift is thus proportional to the downward momentum of this lateral flow and the drag to\nits kinetic energy. Now, of flows having a given momentum, the one\nhaving the smallest kinetic energy is that one which follows the streamlines of an incompressible fluid. Hence a wing of minimum drag should,\nif possible, produce on this rear characteristic surface a flow satisfying\nLaplace\xe2\x80\x99s equation in two dimensions, that is :\n\nr.\n\nThe projected velocity distribution on the reversed characteristicsurface\nthus plays a role similar to the lateral velocity distribution in the Tref\xe2\x82\xactz\nplane in ordinary wing theory. Unlike the Trefftz plane, however, the zone\nof disturbance on the reversed characteristic surface is limited in extent.\nBeyond the Mach waves from the leading edge the lateral entrainment of\nthe wing ceases, leading to the boundary condition q~ = 0, so that the\nwing operates effectively on a limited jet of air. The problem is thus\nanalytically the same as that of a wing at low speed in an open jet wind\ntunnel (see Fig. 1). The increase of the induced drag which results\nfrom the limitation of the wing in the finite jet is exactly equal to the\n\xe2\x80\x9cwave drag\xe2\x80\x9d of the wing in unlimited supersonic flow. Wings having\n\n629\n\nAerodynamic Design for Supersonic Speeds\n\nshort fore-and-aft dimensions have a small area of entrainment, as shown\nby Fig. 2. The effect of increasing the Mach number is shown in Fig. 3.\n\nFIG:1. Equivalent incompressible jet.\n\nFIG.2. Effect of fore-and-aft dimension of wing on area of lateral entrainment.\n\n630\n\n-.\n\nROBERT .JONES\nT\n\nM =2.7\n\nM = 1.4\n\n/\n\nI\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\ni\n\\\n\\\n\nI\nI\n/\n\nFIG. Effect of Mach number on area of lateral entrainment.\n3.\n\nWe recall the formulas of Prandtl and Munk for lift and drag of the\nwing at low speed, that is\n\nL = pwUS\'\nD = *pwaS\'\n\n()\n4\n(5)\n\nwhere w is the downwash and S\' is the area of virtual additional mass of\nthe wing\'s trace. In the new theory these same formulas will apply at\nsupersonic speed if the area S\' is replaced by the area of virtual mass of\nthe wing trace in the finite jet a~ limited by the Mach waves.\nIt seems unlikely that a result of this kind, referring to principles of\nmomentum and energy, would be strictly l i t e d to the linearized version\nof the wing theory. Following this thought, M. D. Van Dyke and I have\nrecently found that equations (l), ( ) and (3) remain valid even when\n2,\nquantities of second order in the velocities and pressures are retained.\nAs ,Ward has indi~ated\'~), relation between the characteristic trace\nthe\nof the wing and its plan form is not unique. Now Kogan\'s analysis yields\nthe minimum drag consistent with a given characteristic trace (including\nthe vortex trace) and a given total lit, or, by an obvious extension, a given\nspanwise load distribution, but it does not give necessarily the minimum\ndrag associated with a given plan form, only a lower bound. For, consider\ntwo outline shapes, one lying within the other, yet both having the same\ncharacteristic trace, so that the two-dimensional solution is the same for\nboth. Subtract one flow from the other: the disturbance is canceled\ncompletely at the characteristic surface, indicating zero drag, yet a dis-\n\n631\n\nAerodynamic Design for Supersonic Speeds\n\n3>\n\ntribution of lift remains in the region of the wings. Thus in determining\nthe minimum drag for a specified characteristic trace we are also determining the associated plan form. For the solution of the minimum\nproblem when the plan form is given we have to return to the criterion\nof constant downwash given earlier.\nE. W. Graham(*)has shown that a result similar to Kogan\xe2\x80\x99s can be\nderived by utilizing the idea of the combined flow field. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s\nanalysis provides further a simple determination of the loadings of the\nwing when integrated in various oblique directions. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s analysis\nbrings out the following interesting question: Suppose we have a surface\ndistribution of lift Z(x,y) and suppose the projected linear loadings\nIL(x,,a) obtained by integrating Z(x,y) along lines in various directions\nx = xo ay are known. Can the surface distribution Z(x,y) be determined from IL(x,,a) ?\nGraham(5)gives the following result; if\n\n+\n\nE(x0,a) =\n\nss\n\nZ(x,y)~(~-xO-~y)dx =\ndy\n\nthen\n@\xe2\x80\x99Y) =\n\n&Sf&\n\ns\n\n~ ( x o + ~ , ~ )( 6 ) ~\nd\n\ndx,da\nax, x -~,--oly\n\n(7)\n\nA somewhat more symmetrical relation can be achieved if we substitute\nfor the Dirac delta function, 6, its equivalent Cauchy integral formula:\n\ns\n\nf(x)b(x-x,)dx=\n\n-\n\n+\n\nx 0i)- f(x-\n\noi) dx = f(xo)\n\nThen we may write\n\n-e+\n\nThe integrations should extend over the largest plan form consistent with\nL\nthe projected lengths of the loadings I ,though the9 lift distribution\nZ(x,y) may not do so.\nStudies by variational methods often establish essential relations with\ngreater clarity than other methods. Here the relation of the drag to the\narea of entrainment and to the momentum and energy of the downwash\nflow is perhaps more significant than the relation for the drag to be an\np\nabsolute minimum. Following this thought we may seek functions for c\nwhich satisfy the condition v = 0 on the outer boundary of the characteristic trace and y2 = constant on the wing trace, but which satisfy\nvz2= 0 only approximately. Thus Heaslet and Fuller(6) find\nquite simple expressions for the drag of wings having the plan form of a\nhyperbola by relaxing this latter condition. Their solutions correspond\nto exact minima of the drag for special positions of the center of pressure.\n\n+\n\n632\n\nROBERT.JONES\nT\n\nThe problem of minimum drag when both the lift and the center of\npressure are fixed has been considered by P. Germah(\'). In this case\nthe divergence of the velocity field is not zero as in equation (3) but has\na constant value. From the practical standpoint it may be noted that a\nwing whose width increases toward the rear generally has a smaller drag\nwhen the centroid of the lift distribution is placed ahead of the aerodynamic center. Thus we may say that the triangular wing has a "negative\ntrim drag". The optimum loading of wings having fore-and-aft symmetry,\nhowever, acts at the middle of the wing, behind the aerodynamic center.\nHence wings having fore-and-aft symmetry or wings whose width decreases toward the rear (e.g., a reversed triangular wing) may be expected\nto have a positive trim drag.\nYAWED A N D S W E P T W I N G S\n\nWith planar wings the wave drag is reduced as the lift distribution is\nextended in the flight direction, while the vortex drag is reduced by extending the span. At the same time the friction drag is reduced by\ndiminishing the exposed area of the wing. At subsonic speeds the last\n\'two considerations are effective and they lead to wing forms approaching\na lifting line perpendicular to the flight direction. At supersonic speeds\nthe added condition on the length leads to a long, narrow wing placed\nat an angle of yaw.\nIt is interesting to analyze the yawed lifting line in terms of its area of\nentrainment. The forward and reversed Mach waves are simply circular\ncones drawn from the ends of the line. At subsonic angles of yaw the\ncones are displaced laterally so that the contour of their inter-section,\nwhich outlines the equivalent jet, is an ellipse. The area of this ellipse\nvanishes rapidly, however, and disappears completely as the lifting line\napproaches the Mach angle. The area of entrainment is zero and the\nwave drag given by the theory is infinite at supersonic angles of yaw.\nIf we convert a yawed wing into a swept wing by bending it at the\nmiddle, keeping the same structural slenderness, we see that the length\nin the flight direction is reduced to about one-half. The wave drag is\nthen increased, so that the potential lift-drag is invariably smaller for\nthe bilaterally symmetric arrangement.\nFigure 4 shows the estimated lift-drag ratios for a slender elliptic wing\n.,\nat various angles of yaw. The Mach number considered here is 1 4 so\nthat the transition from flow of the Kutta- Joukowsky type to the Ackeret\ntype occurs in the vicinity of 45". The best angle of yaw is 30", placing\nthe wing at a transverse Mach number of approximately 0.70. The lift\ncoefficient required for maximum LID at this point is, however, too high\nfor the Kutta-Joukowsky type of flow; hence, additional curves have been\ncomputed to show the effect of limiting the lift coefficient based on the\ntransverse component of velocity to values of 1.0 in one case and 0.5 in\nanother.\n\n633\n\nAerodynamic Dsg for Supersonic Speeds\nein\n\n0\n\nt\n\nI\n\nFIG.4.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n40\'\n50\xc2\xb0\n6\'\n0\n?Oo\nANGLE OF YAW\nEffect of yaw on lift-drag ratio of elliptic wing.\n\nlo"\n\n20\xc2\xb0\n\n30\xc2\xb0\n\nWhether the wing is yawed or swept, the potential lift-drag ratio increases almost without limit as the aspect ratio is increased. The\npractical limit is reached when the lifting pressures become so great\nthat Kutta-Joukowsky flow is no longer possible. A similar situation\narises in the design of a sailplane. Here the lift-drag ratio increases\nrapidly with aspect ratio up to the point at which the optimum lift coefficient begins to exceed the maximum lift coefficientof the wing sections,\nthat is, when Kutta-Joukowsky flow is no longer possible.\nFigure 5 shows the results of some experiments made by Robert T.\n1\n2\nIO\n\n8\n\nI 6\n\nD\n\n4\n2\n3\n\n.04 .08\n\n.2\nI\n\n.6\nI\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\nCL\n\nFIG.

The airfoil section of the model shown is the well-known\nClark Y, which proved superior to especially cambered sections at these\nReynolds numbers.\nThe curve termed \xe2\x80\x9ctheory\xe2\x80\x9d on the figure (Fig. 7) is simply an estimate\nin which the limitation on the transverse lift coefficient was not imposed.\nAt the peak of this curve the lift greatly exceeds the maximum lift coefficient of the Clark Y ai;foil section in two-dimensional flow. The\ntwo arrows shown indicate values of 1.0 and 2.0 for this transverse lift\ncoefficient. There is clearly an uncertainty in our considerations here\nsince the wing has widely different angles of sweep at the leading and\ntrailing edges.\nIn spite of their limitations, the swept wings nevertheless maintain a\nmargin of superiority over rectangular or triangular plan forms except\nat the lowest Reynolds numbers. The narrow swept wings, however,\nhave a greater structural weight and a smaller usable lift coefficient for\nlanding. Unless their potential LID ratios can be approached more\nclosely in practice, their use is difficult to justify in many applications.\nR E D I S T R I B U T I O N OF L I F T BY FUSELAGE\n\nIn steady flow at subsonic speeds the fore-and-aft influence of the wing\nis complete so that concentration of the lift within a narrow chordwise\ndimension causes, theoretically, no increase in the pressure drag associated with the lift. At supersonic speeds the unlimited forward influence\nof the wing is lacking, and the lifting system itself must have an extension\nin the flight direction if lift is to be produced with a minimum of wave\ndissipation.\nSince the fuselage of a supersonic airplane tends to be long and slender,\nthe question of distributing a part of the lift along the fuselage arises.\nThe possibilities inherent in this suggestion have been studied at Ames\n\ncv\n?\n:\n\ni:\n\n,\n\na\nI\n\nFIG.8.\n\n6 36\n\nI\n,S\n\nDistribution of lift along fuselage.\n\nROBWT JONES\nT.\n\nLaboratory and by the theoretical aerodynamics group at the Douglas\nAircraft Company(l0).\nThe simplest aspect of the problem appears if we consider distributions\nof lift on two narrow surfaces in +e form of a cross (see Fig. 8). Both\nthe spanwise and the lengthwise loadings should have the form of smooth\nregular functions. However, if appreciable lift is carried on the \xe2\x80\x9cfuselage\xe2\x80\x9d\nthen the spanwise loading will show an undesirable concentration at the\ncenter. Similarly, a peak in the lengthwise loading appears from the lift\ncarried on the \xe2\x80\x9cwing\xe2\x80\x9d. Desirable loadings appear when the wing and\nthe fuselage each carries a lift approximately equal to the specified value\nL except at the center, where a downward load of magnitude -L must\nappear. Hence the fuselage should carry positive lift front and rear but\nnegative lift in the middle.\nDetailed calculations show that large gains are to be expected if the\ntheoretical redistribution of lift by the fuselage can be accomplished in\npractice. The lifting pressures required on the fuselage are, however,\nof the same order of magnitude as those developed by the wing. According\nto present experience lifting forces of this magnitude cannot be developed\nby bending or inclining a slender body of revolution without causing flow,\ndetachment and the formation of discrete vortices. Further study of this\ntype of favorable fuselage interference should perhaps include some\naccount of flow detachment or, better still, some means for avoiding it.\nH I G H W I N G ARRANGEMENTS\n\nInteraction between lift and volume begins to appear in the drag when\nthe wing and fuselage are separated vertically. This interference is\nfavorable in the case of a high-wing monoplane, but adverse for the low\nwing. More generally, we may consider an interaction between surfaces\ndeveloping forces in a cross-stream direction and elements of volume.\nSuch interactions do not appear at all in the so-called \xe2\x80\x9csupersonic area\nrule\xe2\x80\x9d. They appear in Hayes\xe2\x80\x99 formula\xe2\x80\x98ll), however, since the latter is\nvalid quite generally for distributions of singularities in three dimensions.\nAn equally general formulation is given by Lomax and Heas\xe2\x82\xacet(12),\nwhich\nexpresses the drag directly in terms of the volume distribution and the\nlateral forces. In the well-known Ferrari ringed body the interaction\nbetween these terms may be considered complete, since the wave drag\nis canceled exactly.\nSuch an arrangement may be made to develop lii, but the wave cancellation is then of course incomplete. The most efficient way to gain lift seems\nto be to omit the lower half of the ring, thus creating a kind of \xe2\x80\x9cparasol\xe2\x80\x9d\nmonoplane with a highly arched wing (see Fig. 9). The possibility of\nobtaining high lift-drag ratios with wing-body combinations of thii form\nhas been carefully investigated in papers by Lomax and Heaslet of the\nNACA (ref. 12, and unpublished) and Beane and Ryan of the Douglas\nCompany(ls). Figure 9 illustrates the wing-body arrangement and shows\n\n637\n\nAerodynamic Design for Supersonic Speeds\n\nI\n\nLOMAX\n\nI\n\nI\n\nh\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG.\n9. Estimated lift-drag ratio of body with arched wing.\n\nsome typical results at design conditions. As in the case of planar wings,\nimportant gains could be shown if the fuselage could be assumed to\ndevelop sizeable cross forces. When this possibility is discounted the liftdrag ratios fall considerably but not below those estimated for highly\nswept wings.\nThe arrows represent estimates made by Lomax and Heaslet for a\nwing, a body, and two supporting struts. The flattened body carries no\nnet lift but does support a lift distribution. The wide band covered by\nthe arrows is necessitated by the lack of experimental information on the\nmagnitude of the cross forces that can be generated by body distortions.\nThe curve represents estimates made by Beane and Ryan for a wing\nand body without the wing support system. Their body, however, was\nrequired to carry no lift, even locally. Further, their choice of the\nturbulent skin-friction drag coefficient was higher, 0.0030 as compared\nto 0.0025. The conclusion appears to be that the highly arched wing\nand body can have as high a value of LID as the swept wing and body.\nAs in the case of the swept wing, the estimated LID ratio increases if\nthe wetted area can be reduced by reducing the wing chord. Here again\nwe encounter the limitation imposed by the magnitude of the pressure\ncoefficient. As the wing is made narrower the pressures on the wing\nincrease. The wing pressures are moreover reflected to the rear of the\nbody and increased by a focusing effect. Thus we may expect flow\nseparation at the rear of the body. The influence of these phenomena\non the actual characteristics of such an arched wing arrangement will\nhave to be determined experimentally.\nIn the methods employed by Ferri(I*), and Rossow(15),the physical\naspect of interference phenomena is made evident. Considering the\n\n638\n\nROBERT JONES\nT.\n\ninterference between planar wings and bodies, these studies have shown\ndefinitely favorable effects for high-wing arrangements.\nIt will be interesting to try and determine a lower bound that might\nbe approached by this method of drag reduction. Referring to Kogan\xe2\x80\x99s\nanalysis we find that the conditions imposed on the downwash flow in\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent incompressible jet\xe2\x80\x9d are unaltered by the presence of\nbodies, provided these do not extend beyond the characteristic envelope\nof the wing. The added bodies may bring the drag of a given wing closer\nto this lower bound. However, if a wing shape can be found which causes\nthe streamlines of the downwash to follow the pattern of an incompressible\nflow, then the addition of bodies cannot reduce the drag, except as they\nmay extend the lateral zone of influence of the wing-body system.\nCANCELATION O F T H I C K N E S S DRAG\n\nAt intermediate supersonicspeeds the wave drag due to thickness can be\nreduced to small values by the phenomenon of wave reflection. There\nexists a great variety of three-dimensional toroidal shapes for which the\nwave system is entirely self-contained; that is, the wave resistance is zero\nat certain Mach numbers, as in the Busemann biplane. One such example with which we have experimented at Ames Laboratory is illustrated in Fig. 10. The model is essentially a tube so shaped as to produce\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\n.I 2 r\nFRONT VIEW\n\n0\n\nrI\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\x99,\nSIDE VIEW\nI\n-4O\n\nI\n0\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\n4O\n8O\nI2 O\nANGLE OF A T T A C K\nFIG.1 .

Such shapes are easily constructed by marking\nout a stream surface of arbitrary cross section in the undisturbed flow\nahead and then calculating the inward deflections of this surface as it\npasses through the plane wave system of the biplane. Since the wave\nsystem has no lateral velocities (Le., no components in the y direction),\n\n6 39\n\nAerodynamic Design for Supersonic Speeds\n\nthe boundary conditions may be satisfied most conveniently by referring\nthem to sections of the torus made by vertical planes (see Fig. 10).\nTubular bodies having no wave drag can also be made with multiple\nsymmetry, or with complete rotational symmetry. However, such shapes\nordinarily enclose regions in which the pressure rises to large values\nbecause of focusing. In the case of plane waves the reflection involves\nonly a factor of 2-and this seems to be the smallest value obtainable.\nThe experiments were made by Loren Bright of Am- Laboratory and\nshowed a negligible wave drag at the design Mach number of 2.0. The\nmost complete wave cancelation, however, occurred at a slightly higher\nMach number, M = 2-3. I n Fig. 10 the drag is plotted against angle\nof attack at M = 2.0. At about. 5\xe2\x80\x9d the wave system changes suddenly\nand the drag increases.\nSimilar experiments with a torus designed to produce an oblique\n(i.e., yawed) system of plane waves showed a somewhat more continuous\nbehavior.\nWhiie the experiments showed that the wave drag associated with the\nvolume could be eliminated, the tubular bodies developed rather low\nvalues of lift-to-drag ratio. It seems that the added surface area reqkred\nto enclose the wave system increased the friction drag enough to overbalance the gain in wave drag. At still higher Mach numbers the friction\ndrag becomes increasingly important relative to the thickness drag. The\nuse of wave cancelation between interfering bodies or surfaces is more\neasily justified if the added surfaces are also desirable for some other\nreason, such as stabilization or control.\nL I F T AND DRAG AT HIGH ALTITUDES\n\nIn his article \xe2\x80\x9cSuperaerodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d in the Journal o the Franklin\nf\nInstitute, Feb. 1934(16),\nAlbert F. Zahm refers to flight in the upper atmospheric layers and states that \xe2\x80\x9cSpace craft and projectiles must obey new\nor modified laws of air resistance. These may well be studied in highvacuum wind tunnels or chambers, under guidance,of mathematical\ntheory\xe2\x80\x9d. I remember Zahm\xe2\x80\x98s paper well, since I was a student of his at\nthe time and made drawings for the figures that appear in the paper. I\nalso recall that the paper was not accepted for publication by the journals\nto which it was first submitted. One is tempted to think that it might\nbe a great service if journals published, in addition to their tables of\ncontents, some notice of the rejected contributions.\nZahm considered the flow of individual particles of a tenuous gas and\nindicated the modifications needed for diffuse reflection or re-emission\nof molecules.

The descent is uncontrolled\nexcept that the direction of the resultant aerodynamic force is maintained\nat a fixed angle to the direction of motion, corresponding to a fixed LID\nratio.

Figure 13,\nprepared from data given in ref. 20, shows how closely this simple rule\nis obeyed by more precise calculations.\nThe loss of lift in free-molecule flow is a consequence of Knudsen\xe2\x80\x99s\nlaw, according to which the emission of molecules is independent of their\nangle of arrival at the surface. Such behavior is closely approximated\nin experiments conducted thus far(21122).\nIt seems unfortunate that the small departures from Knudsen\xe2\x80\x99s law\nhave served to characterize a whole regime of rarefied gas dynamics as\nthe region of \xe2\x80\x9cslip flow\xe2\x80\x9d. The main effects seem to be related more\ndirectly to the \xe2\x80\x9csticking\xe2\x80\x9d of the molecules rather than to their slipping.\nSince the pressures developed at high speed are large compared to the\nambient pressure, we may expect an extensive range of conditions in which\nthe medium behaves as a gas in the vicinity of the body but as a molecular beam in the exterior flow. The investigation of this semi-continuous\nregime promises a great variety of yet undiscovered aerodynamic\nphenomena.\nIn conclusion, the writer wishes to express appreciation to his colleagues\nat Ames Laboratory for assistance in preparing this paper and to\nH.

INTRODUCTION\nI n linearized flow theory, certain very interesting extrema1 properties\nof wings can be derived under rather broad conditions without the use of\na complicated mathematical apparatus. The present chapter reviews\ncertain results of this theory and indicates some rather obvious extensions\nto incorporate various auxiliary conditions. Several examples illustrating\nthe relation between the geometrical features of the wing and the lift\ndistribution for minimum drag are given.\n\n2,\n\nMINIMUM DRAG PROBLEM\n\nI n this section, we consider a thin, cambered lifting surface of given\nplanform and investigate the pressure distribution p ( x , y ) which yields\nthe minimum drag under various auxiliary conditions (Ref. 1). For this\npurpose, the drag D in frictionless flow is written in the form\n\nwhere x is a chordwise coordinate, y a spanwise coordinate, and a ( x , y )\nthe rearward inclination of the normal to the surface element dS = d x dy\n(Fig. 1). With regard to the auxiliary conditions, the following isoperimetric constraints have engineering interest:\nL=\n\nJ-1d x d y\np\nS\n\nif the lift is given,\n\n1M, = J-J- PlY I dXdY\nS\n\n(3)\n\n* Principal Research Engineer, Avco-Everett Research Laboratory, Everett,\nassachusetts.\n\n6 47\n\nRobert T.

Cambered lifting surface.\n\nif the bending moment is prescribed, and\nM, =\n\njj p x d x d y\nS\n\n(4)\n\nif the pitching moment is given. Incidentally, the constraints (2) through\n(4) are particular cases of 2 more general constraining relationship having\nthe form\n\nwhere C is a given constant and where f ( x , y) is a prescribed weighing\nfunction. This weighing function has the values f = 1 if the lift is given,\nf = I y I if the bending moment is prescribed, andf = x if the pitching\nmoment is given.\nThe problem considered here consists of minimizing the drag integral\n(1) subject to one or more isoperimetric constraints \'having the form\ndescribed by Eq. (5). Clearly, this problem involves two independent\nvariables (x, y ) and two dependent variables (p, a). The latter, however,\nare related through the partial differential equations and boundary\nconditions describing the flow around the wing or through certain\nintegral\' relations. Since this method of solution is rather complicated,\nwe abandon it and approach the problem through the use of the reverse\nflow theorems already established for a wing in linearized supersonic\nflow (Refs. 2 and 3).\nFrom the linearized theory, it is known that the drag associated with\na given distribution of lift remains unchanged when the direction of\nmotion of the wing is reversed. The angle of attack distribution over the\nwing surface in the reverse flow may be denoted by ar(x, y) and will, of\ncourse, differ from a(x, y) if the pressure distribution p(x, y) is to remain\n\n648\n\n8. Three-Dimensional Wings of Minimum Pressure Drag\n\n127\n\nunchanged. In view of the reverse flow theorem, we may express the drag\nin terms of a combinedflow field obtained by superimposing the disturbances created by the given lift distribution in the forward and reverse\nmotions (Fig. 2). Thus, if we write\nE = (a\n\n+ a,)/2\n\n(6)\n\nthe drag may be rewritten in the form\n\nand is stationary provided (see Chapter 3)\n\nwhere 8p and 8a denote variations calculated at a constant station x , y .\nOn the other hand, the satisfaction of the isoperimetric condition ( 5 )\nrequires that\n\nHence, if h denotes an undetermined, constant Lagrange multiplier and\nif Eqs. (8) and (9) are combined linearly, we deduce that\n\ne\n\\\n\n\'\n\\\n\n\'\n\\\n\n\'.,\n\n/\n\'\n\n,\n\'\n\nErrsonic\n\n1\n,2\n\'\n\n\'\n\\\n\nI\n\n\\\n\n\'.\n\nFIG.2. Lifting surfaces with superimposed disturbance fields.\n\n6 49\n\nRobert T. Jones\nAt this point, we note that the variations 8p and 8E are not independent.\nHowever, as was shown in Ref. 1, the symmetry introduced by superimposing the forward and reverse disturbance fields is such that the two\ninterference drags are equal, that is,\n\nConsequently, after Eqs. (10) and (11) are combined, we obtain the\nrelationship\n\nSIs(.\n\n-Af)8pdxdy =0\n\n(12)\n\n.\n\nwhich involves onIy the independent variation 8p. Because of this, the\nEuler equation describing the extremal solution is given by\n(13)\nwhich has the following significance: the angle of attack in the combined\nflow field must be proportional to the weighing function imposed on the\npressure distribution.\nA modification of the previous problem arises when several isoperimetric constraints of the form\n= Af(x,y)\n\nare impoved on the wing. Under these conditions, the Euier equation\nbecomes\n7n\n\n= ZX,fj(X,Y)\n\n(15)\n\n$4\n\nwhere each of the multipliers Aj is an undetermined constant.\n\n3. PARTICULAR CASES\nThe previous extremal property for the drag is remarkable for the\neconomy of its derivation. It holds for subsonic as well as supersonic\nflows and is not even restricted to steady motion. Several particular cases\nare now considered.\n3.1, Given Lift.\n\nIf only the lift is prescribed, Eq. (13) becomes\n\n&=A\n\n(16)\n\nmeaning that the angle of attack of the combined flow field is constant\nover the entire planform. Hence, the downwash angle, which is pro-\n\n650\n\n8. Three-Dimensional Wings of Minimum Pressure Drag\nportional to E, is constant. Furthermore, for the subsonic flow regime, the\nspanwise lift distribution is elliptical, as shown by Munk in Ref. 4.\nIncidentally, a change in the chordwise lift distribution does not cause a\nmodification in the induced drag as long as the spanwise lift distribution\nis the same (for further comments, see Section 3.2).\nIt should be noted that the elliptic loading also plays an important\nrole in the minimum drag of supersonic wings. If, following an analogy to\nWhittaker\'s solution of Laplace\'s equation (Ref. 5), we calculate the\ndisturbance field of a supersonic wing by the superposition of twodimensional fields, we find that the downwash is the sum of the contributions due to a series of two-dimensional loadings obtained by projecting\nthe lift distribution in different directions. Thus, a Lower bound for the\ndrag may be obtained by assuming that each projected or integrated\nloading is elliptical. If the planform is elliptic, this lower bound is the\nactual minimum value, providing the pressure is constant. As an example,\nat Mi = 2/z,the minimum drag of an unyawed wing is given by (Ref. 5)\n\nwhere p is the free-stream density, U is the free-stream velocity, a and 6\nare the semiaxes of the ellipse, and S is its area. If the wing is yawed, the\ncorresponding minimum drag is given by (Ref. 5 )\n\nwhere i denotes the imaginary unit, 9 the real part of the complex\n\'\nnumber within brackets, and where the quantities a, b\', and m are defined\nin Fig. 3.\n\nFIG. 3. Oblique ellipse.\n\n651\n\nRobert T. Jones\n\n3.2. Given Lift and Bending Moment. I n steady subsonic flow,\nthe superposition of the forward and reverse disturbance fields results in a\npurely two-dimensional field of motion identical with the flow produced\nby the vortex wake in the Trefftz plane. The inclination E in the combined\nflow field may then be identified with the induced downwash wi of Munk\xe2\x80\x99s\ntheory (Ref. 4), that is,\nE =w,/u\n\n(19)\n\nI n such a two-dimensional field, E is independent of the chordwise\ncoordinate x. Therefore, the specification of a weighing function f which\ndepends on x does not lead to a solution of the problem. However, we\nmay impose various conditions on the spanwise distribution of the lift.\nThus, following Ref. 6, we may specify both the total lift and the\nbending moment. I n this case, the angle of attack of the combined flow\nfield is given by\n5 = A,\n\n+\n\nA21\n\nY\n\nI\n\n(20)\n\nI n Munk\xe2\x80\x99s original problem (Ref. 4 ,the span b and the total lift were\n)\nprescribed, and the optimum lift distribution was found to be elliptical.\nNow, let us consider a family of wings having the same lift and bending\nmoment as Munk\xe2\x80\x99s optimum wing, and let us study the effect of the span\non the optimum lift distribution as well as on the drag. The analysis,\nomitted for the sake of brevity (Ref. 6 ) ,shows that increasing values of the\nspan cause the lift distribution to become more tapered and the induced\n)\ndrag to become smaller (Fig. 4 .\n2.0\n\n1.6\n\n12\n.\n\nDID.\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0\n0.8\nF I G . 4.\nmoment.\n\n6 52\n\n10\n.\n\n1.2\n\nb/b.\n\n14\n.\n\n16\n.\n\n8\n\nMinimum vortex drag for wings having a fixed lift and a fixed bending\n\n8. Three-Dimensional Wings of Minimum Pressure Drag\n3.3. Given Lift and Pitching Moment. If an elliptic wing is\ndesigned for a given total lift in supersonic flow, the minimum drag\noccurs when the pressure is uniform. I n other words, the center of\npressure is identical with the center of the wing. Now, it is known that the\ncentroid of the lift added by a change in the angle of attack is ahead of\nthis point, especially if the wing has a low aspect ratio. Thus, the wing\ntrimmed for flight with the optimum loading is unstable in pitch. These\nideas lead us to specify the position of the center of pressure, or the\npitching moment, as well as the total lift.\nNow, if both the lift and the pitching moment are specified, Eq. (15 )\nbecomes\nG=A1+Afl\n\n(211\n\nmeaning that the combined angle of attack is a linear function of the\nchordwise coordinate. By the method of Ref. 5, it can be shown that the\nassociated pressure distribution is also a linear function of the chordwise\ncoordinate, that is,\n\nP\n\n= Pl\n\n+ Pzx\n\n(22)\n\nOmitting detailed manipulations, we obtain the following expression for\nthe minimum drag of an unyawed elliptical wing at M = 1/2:\n\nwhere 3 is the chordwise displacement of the center of pressure with\nrespect to the centroid of the ellipse.\n\n4. NONPLANAR WINGS\nThe foregoing derivation is easily extended to nonplanar lifting surfaces\nsuch as a wing with upturned or downturned tips (Fig. 5). If the angle\nof attack is defined as the angle between the free-stream velocity vector\n\nFIG.5. Wing with drooped tips.\n\n653\n\nRobert T. Jones\nand its projection on the wing surface, the drag is still given by Eq. (7)\nwith the understanding that x is a rectilinear chordwise coordinate and y\nis a curvilinear spanwise coordinate parallel to thpl wing surface. Because\nof the inclination of the pressure, the lift is given by\n\np cos S(3) dx-dy\n\n1=\n,\nS\n\nwhere the angle 001) is defined in Fig. 5. Consequently, if the l i t is the\nonly quantity prescribed, the condition for minimum drag becomes\n= x cos e@)\n\nar\n\n(25)\n\nFor a wing with vertical end plates, cos 0 = 0 over the end plates; hence,\nthe sidewash of the combined flow field must vanish.\n\n5. ALTERNA\'IZ APPROACH\nIn Kogan\'s analysis (Ref. 7), the minimum drag problem is approached\nfrom a different point of view. Instead of superimposing the forward and\nreverse disturbance fields, he utilizes the physically real flow and\nexpresses the drag in terms of quantities integrated over the enveloping\ncharacteristic surface of the wing. Such a characteristic envelope involves\nboth forward and reverse Mach waves tangent to the edges of the wing\n(Fig. 6).\nWith the forward-going characteristic surface Z as a reference, one\nobtains the following expression for the drag:\n\nA\n//\'\n\n\'\\\\\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n/\n\n\'\n\\\n\n/\n\'\nI\n\'\n\n-y=\n,,\n\n/\'\n/\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n___t\n\nUndisturbed\n\nflow direction\n\n/\n\'\n\\\n\n/\n\n\',\n\\,\n\n/\n\'\n\n,\n/\n\n\'\n\\\n\n/\n\n\'\n\\\n\nI\n\n/\n\'\n//\n\n\',\n\\\n\\\n\n"\n\n,/\n/\n\nI\n\nFIG.6. Characteristic envelope of a wing.\n\n654\n\n8. Three-Dimensional Wings of Minimum Pressure Drag\nwhile the total lift is given by\n\nwhere q is the velocity potential and where qa and qa denote the y-component and the z-component of the disturbance velocity after projection\n.\non the surface Z Thus, the drag is proportional to the kinetic energy of\nthis two-dimensional flow, while the lift is proportional to its downward\n\xe2\x80\x99isnpulse. Now, among all the flows having a given impulse, the one with\nthe smallest kinetic energy satisfies Laplace\xe2\x80\x99s equation (Kelvin\xe2\x80\x99s\ntheorem), that is,\n(PVV\n\n+\n\n(Pzs\n\n=0\n\n(28)\n\nHence, minimum drag is achieved when the streamlines of this lateral:\nflow on the rear characteristic surface imitate a two-dimensional incompressible flow. The connection between Kogan\xe2\x80\x99s analysis and our\nprevious treatment employing the combined disturbance field has been\nshown by Graham in Ref. 8.\nFollowing Prandtl and Munk, we are accustomed to thinking\nof the drag of a wing in terms of its area of entrainment. As is\nwell known in subsonic steady flow, the equivalent entrainment with\noptimum loading is represented by a circular jet having a diameter equal\nto the span of the wing. The drag of the wing at subsonic speeds is small\nbecause the area of entrainment is large. At supersonic speeds, however,\nthe lateral influence of the wing is restricted by the Mach waves, so that\nthe downwash associated with a given lift must be greater. Kogan\xe2\x80\x99s\nanalysis gives a quantitative value to these intuitive considerations.\nREFWENCES\n\n1.\n2.\n\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\n6.\n\nJONES, R.

The present paper reviews previaus work on the aerodynamies and Right stability of oblique wing\ncombinations and suggests a possible mode of application to transport aircraft operating at moderate supersonic\n\nspeeds.\n\nIntroduction\n\n0\n\nNE ofthe unspoken assumptions in aircraft design is that of\nbilateral or mirror symmetry At sloa Right speeds, this\nassumption seems on rather secure ground, partly because of the\nindications of aerodynamic theory. but also because it agrees\nwith the observed evolutionary forms of birds\nAlthough it is perhaps natural to extrapolate the forms of birds\nand animals to the supersonic flight regme, there has been no\nrational discussion ofthe merits of bilateral symmetry for supersonic flight. In fact, once the velocity of sound is exceeded, the\nlaws of aerodynamics change in such a way as to make it seem\ninadvisable to arrange the components of an airplane side by side\nor abreast in a supersonic stream unless there are compelling\nreasons for such an arrangement\nBoth the transonic area rule and the supersonic small disturbance theory show large adverse interference effects for bodies or\nwings m a mirror-symmetric arrangement Figure I shows the\nresult of applying supersonic wave drag theory to two arplanes\nflying in close formation at a slightly supersonic Mach number\nIn the mirror-symmetric arrangement, the drag of each aircraft\nis doubled by the interference of the other, making a total wave\ndrag of four In the staggered or antisymmetric arrangement,\nhowever, the wave interference is favorable so that the drag of\nthe two airplanes is no greater than that of a single one. Figure\n2 shows the same e l k 3 for oblique wing panels.

Also, shown on the graphs, are the angles of yaw at which\nthe crosswise Mach number exceeds an assumed critical value of\n0.7.\nTo obtain a reasonably uniform distribution of lifting pressure\nat large angles of yaw, the wing must be constructed with a certain\ncamber and twist Calculations of the required camber and twist\nhave been made by R.

Thus, for\nthe sections of the wing perpendicular to its long axis, one would\nselect airfoil shapes capable of sustaining a high-lift coefficient at\na high value of the crosswise component Mach number. Increasing the sweep angle will decrease the component Mach numberbut the lift coefficient based on the reduced component velocity\nwill then increase These considerations involdthe critical Mach\nnumber and the lift coefficient in combination and point to the\nchoice of airfoil sections that can develop a high ratio of absolute\nlifting pressure to ambient pressure, i.e.,\nPJP. = (v/~)M\xe2\x80\x99CL\nwithout drag penalty\nThe minimum wave drag for a given internal volume of the\nelliptic wing occurs when the thickness ratio of the sections\nfalls of elliptically toward the tips.\xe2\x80\x99 The formula for the drag\ndue to thickness or volume in the case of the yawed ellipse is\ngiven by J. H. B Smith\xe2\x80\x99 and the results are plotted in Fig 8 for\nan axis ratio of 10 to 1 and a root thickness/chord ratio ofO.l.\nThe wave drag associated with the volume of the wing shows a\nsteep rise as the long axis of the wing turns into the wind, the\ninfluence ofthe inverse fourth power of the projected length. Here,\nhowever, the drag increase associated with nonlinear or supercritical flow over the wing sections may dominate, so that the\nprediction of linear theory will not be adequate. It is here that\nthe newer developments in supercritical wing sections exemplified\nby the work of Piercey, Niewland, and Whitcomb may be\nsignificant for the antisymmetric wing.\nThe drag values, given by linear theory together with a suitable\nestimate of the skin friction, enable the prediction to be made of\nlift-dragratiosofelliptic\nwings at varous Mach numbers and yaw\nangles Such predIctIons wdl be valid if proper account is taken\n\ncDll /,\nM=I.j\xe2\x80\x99I\xe2\x80\x99\n\n= 0.1,\n02\n\nolil.LY4L\n0\n\n3 0 6 0 9 0\n\n0\n\n5\n\nIO\n1\n5\nAXIS RATQ b/a\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFig. 10 Variation of L/D with axis ratio showing effect of limitatha\nof the normal lift coefficient C , ,\nL,\n\n661\n\nR.

The optimum crosswise\nMach number indicated by linear theory is approximately 0.7,\nclose to one limit imposed by nonlinear effects\n\nAlAA JOURNAL\n\nWhile satisfactory stability can probably be achieved with the\nyawed wing in the normal flight range, some unusual effects will\ncertainly be apparent. One effect that can be anticipated is a\ncoupling between yaw angle and vertical acceleration, i.e., i?L/2$.\nA simple estimate for a wing at 45\xe2\x80\x9d yaw shows (l/L)(?L/?@)= 1,\nis., lg per radian of sideslip angle $. This value may be compared to the sensitivity of vertical acceleration to angle of\nattack changes. Assuming aC,/aa = 5, and a flight-lift coefficient\nof 1.0 we have (l/LXaL/aa) = 5; hence, the sensitivity to yaw is\nabout f the sensitivity to pitch.\nDynamic coupling between different degrees of freedom is not\nalways undesirable since excessive damping in one mode may be\ndistributed to a mode that would otherwise be deficient. Of\ncourse, conventional treatments of stability, which assume bilateral symmetry with the resulting division into \xe2\x80\x9clongitudinal\xe2\x80\x9d\nand \xe2\x80\x9dlateral\xe2\x80\x9d motions, are inapplicable in this case, and a full\ntreatment involving six degrees of freedom as well as aeroelastic\ndeformations will be required.\nAs is well known, slanted or swept wings tend to stall first at\nthe downstream tips. With the swept wing the loss of lift at the\ntips leads to a nose-up tendency aggravating the stall. In the\ncase of the slanted wing, the situation would Seem worse since\nthe asymmetric stall would lead to bank. The special measures\nused to control the pitchup tendency of swept wings may quite\npossibly not be adequate for a yawed wing of high aspect ratio.\nAt best, it is difficult to envision regular landings with the wing\nin the oblique position, and it seems desirable to incorporate.\nstraightened out for\nvariable geometry so that the wing may\nlanding.\n\nbe\n\nApplication to Transport Aircraft\nWind-Tunnel Tests of Yawed Wing Combinations\nFew wind-tunnel experiments have been made to test the predictions for oblique wings of high-aspect ratio. One set of experiments testing yawed and swept wings in conjunction with a\nfuselage was made by G . H. Holdaway and E. W. Hatfield\xe2\x80\x9d at\nAmes Aeronautical Laboratory (now Ames Research Center).\nThe angles of sweep or yaw in these tests was 40\xe2\x80\x9d and the wing\nthickness-chord ratio, approximately 11% Figure 12 shows the\ndrag at zero lift for two of the combinations tested At M = 10\nthe antisymmetric configuration has much smaller drag, as\nexpected At M = 1.15, however, the normal component of M is\napproximately 0 88, exceedingthe drag rise Mach number of the\nsections. Beyond this point, the drag of the yawed wing is higher\n\nStability and Control of Yawed Wing Aircraft\nWhen the advantages of\xe2\x80\x9csubsonic\xe2\x80\x9d sweep first became mident,\nquestions were raised about the possibility of flying an airplane\nwith the wing set at a large angle of yaw Perhaps the earliest\nexperiments to test the flight stability of such an arrangement\nwere made in 1946 by J P Campbell and H M Drake\xe2\x80\x9d in the\nFree-Flight Tunnel at Langley Field, Va\nCampbell and Drake found that the yawed wing avoided the\nlarge rolling moment due to sideslip and the consequent short\nperiod rolling oscillations of the swept wing They noted that the\nflight characteristics ofthe model remained essentially unchanged\nup to angles of yaw of 40\xe2\x80\x99 and were still satisfactory at 50\xe2\x80\x9d Of\nspecial interest is the observation that deflection of the ailerons\nproduced no observable pitching motion in free Right Evidently,\nthe change of longitudinal lift distributlon produced by deflecting\nthe ailerons is almost immediately cancelled by rolling motion of\nthe model The wing in effect simply follows the helix angle\ndefined by an effective twist associated with the aileron deflection\nwith no significant change in lift distribution The longitudinal\nstability and the trimmed lift are then governed by the position of\nthe aerodynamic center and the horizontal tail setting referred to\nthe oblique axis of the wing Some years later the present writer\ndemonstrated the rather surprising stability of the slanted wing\nby flying models at the first ICAS meeting in Madrid\n\n662\n\nVarying the angle of sweep or yaw has, of course, marked\nadvantages for other flight conditions, such as \xe2\x80\x9cholding\xe2\x80\x9d at subsonic speeds or adapting the airplane to cruise effiaently at\ndifferent Mach numbers Thus, overland flights of a supersonic\naircraft will probably be limited to Mach numbers low enough\nto avoid the sonic boom The same aircraft may fly much faster\nover water\nG H\nhas suggested that the mechanical problems of\nvariable geometry would be effectively eliminated by making an\n\xe2\x80\x9dall-wing\xe2\x80\x9d aircraft Such a step is certainly attractive, but with\ncurrent densities and loadings seems to be possible only for\nairplanes of very great size Lee assumes an airplane designed to\ncruise at M = 2 0 and compares the yawed-wing arcraft with the\nmore conventional delta wing type\nThe yawed wing was found capable of carrying twice the payload on the Atlantic flight chiefly because of its better off-design\nperformance It is antiapated that current supersonic transports\nmay consume as much as my,, of their fuel load in subsonic\nmaneuvers The ability to cruise or hold efficiently at reduced\nspeed would thus be important for the utility of such aircraft\nCurrent delta wing transports require laige amounts of power for\ntakeoff primarily because of large values of weight per unit span.\nSince the takeoff power diminishes approximately as the power\nof the span loading,extending the wing span can be very effective\nin reducing takeoff distance and noise\n\n2\n\n\\\n\nf\n\n0\n1\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1\n0\nMWCY\n\nNIIUT)FO\n\n1.1\n\nI\n\n1.2\n\nLA\n\nFig. 12 Drag at zero lift; comparison of yawed and swept wings.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nREDUCTION OF WAVE DRAG BY ANTISYMMETRIC ARRANGEMENT\n\nFEBRUARY 1972\n\na) Trimmed for M E 1\n\nby upward gust is aerodynamically equivalent to a twist, similar\nto that produced by deflecting ailerons. The air load due to such\na twist is, however, almost immediately cancelled by a rolling\nmotion with the helix angle of the roll (pY/Zu)equal to that of the\ntwist. Hence, the relief provided by the rolling motion should\neffectively cancel the tendency for aeroelastic divergence in the\ncase of the oblique wing. Stresses that arise during the acceleration of the rolling motion would be proportonal to the inertia\nin roll of the masses attached to the wing. Since the single\nfuselage at the center of the wing has almost negligible inertia in\nroll, one arrives at the surprising conclusion that the one-body\narrangement has greater aeroelastic stability than the two-body\narrangement. In either case, stability must be assured by adequate\nwing stiffness and adequate longitudinal stability. Clearly a more\ncomplete analysis, taking account of the free motions of the\naircraft as well as its elastic deflections will be required.\nTable 1 listsestimated components ol drag lor the arrangement\nshown in Fig. 13 at M = 1 . s 1 . 1 with the wing set at 45\xe2\x80\x9d.\nTable 1 Drag estimate for antisymmehic- ans sport aircraft\n\n__ - __\n\nI ) Wave drag of bodies\n2) Wave drag of wing alone\n\nb) Trimmed for\n\n3) Wing-body interference drag\n4) Dragfinterference of tail surfaces\n.5) Friction drag of wing\n6) Nonlinear \xe2\x80\x9cform\xe2\x80\x9d drag of wing\n7) Friction drag of bodies\n8) Friction drag oftail surfaces\n9) Friction drag ofengine nacelles\n\nM < 0.7\n\n-\n\nCD = 0001\n\n00004\n00006\n00005\n0 004\n0.004\n0 0034\nOb016\n00007\n\nCD, = 0.0162\n\n10) Lift induced drag at C ,\n\nc)\n\nTrimmed for M\n\n= 1.3\n\n- 1d\n\nFig. 13 Antisymmetric transport aircraft.\n\nArrangements permitting more conventional values of wing\nloadingandsizeare shown in Figs 13(a-c) and 14 The useoftwo\nbodies connected across by the wing and horizontal tail in a parallelogram arrangement has certain advantages ovei the usual\narrangement for variable sweep Shearing the parallelogram does\nnot displace its center of gravity and only slightly displaces the\ncenter of lift The first-order variation of lateral trim with yaw\nangle can be compensated by constructing the wing with an\nappropriate curvilinear dihedral as indicated earlier\nAs is well known, varying the geometry of the swept wing has\nseveral drawbacks First of all, massive bearings which can carry\nthe wing root bending moment must be used Secondly, movement of the lifting surface backward at supersonic speeds compounds the normal rearward travel of lifting pressure at these\nspeeds With the single slanted wing, however, the wing-beam\nstructure is continuous across the pivots and no primary bending\nloads appear\nIntuitively, one would expect the forward tip of the slanted\nwing to show a tendency for aeroelastic divergence Both slanted\nand swept wings tend to become concave upward when deflected\nunder a gust load, leading momentarily to a tendency to pitch up\nand increase the load However, the observation made in the free\nflight-tunnel\xe2\x80\x9d is relevant here for the case of the slanted wing.\nThe observation was that increasing the effective angle of attack\nof the forward wing tip and reducing that of the rearward tip by\ndeflecting the ailerons did not result in observable pitching\nmotion but only in roll\nIt can be seen that the elastic deflection of the oblique wing\n\n= 0.575\n\n= 0.0162\n\nAt M = 1 2, the yaw angle required is about 50\xe2\x80\x98 and the\nestimated L/D falls to approximately 15 When trimmed for subsonic flight (Fig 13b) the LID should exceed 20 to 1\nIn conclusion, it is admittedly surprising that aerodynamics\nand simple mechanics would lead to an antisymmetric form for\nsupersonic flight The difficulties with such forms may, however,\nbe more conceptual than real and it is hoped that our analysis,\nthough incomplete, will show that such configurations deserve\nmore serious study\n\nRefeiences\nJones, R T , \xe2\x80\x9cWing Planforms for High Speed Flight,\xe2\x80\x9d TN 1033.\n1946, Rept 863, 1947, NACA\nvon Kgrmin.

JONES\nNASA Ames Research Center\n\nNew demands on the SST for better economy and\nless noise make it seem appropriate to consider a\nradically different concept of design. The shape\nsuggested here: an almost perfectly conventional\nsubsonic aircraft equipped with a straight wing of\nhigh aspect ratio, but with the wing arranged so\nthat it can be turned to different oblique angles for\nflight at different Mach numbers.\nNot a new idea at all, turning the wing as a whole\ninstead of sweeping it back from the middle has\nbeen proposed several times in the past by the\npresent writer and others.\xe2\x80\x99- 3,1 O J. P. Campbell\nand H. M. Drake studied the stability and control\nof oblique-winged aircraft in the NACA Free Flight\nTunnel more than 25 years ago.\xe2\x80\x98 Early in the 1960s\nG. H. Lee considered the advantages of an \xe2\x80\x9callwing\xe2\x80\x9d aircraft arranged so that it could be steered\nby flying at varying oblique angle^.^,^ In addition\nto American work, it appears that German\naerodynamicists made classified studies of such\nconfigurations during W W 11. Specifically,\nRichard Vogt of the Blohm and Voss Company\n\nROBERT T. JONES (F) is a senior\nstaff scientist at Ames. He has\nplayed a major part in raising the\naircraft\nthrough\nspeed of\ndeveloping theory for swept and\nslender delta wings. In 1946 the\nAIAA gave him its Sylvanus Albert\nReed Award. He has remained with\nNACA-NASA since 1934, except\nfor seven years with the AVCO\nEverett Research Lab, where h e\ndirected work on cardiac-assist devices. .He has also professionally\nfollowed an interest in optics.\n\nproposed designs of this type, but the projects did\nnot reach the stage of flight test.\nThese proposals do not seem to have been taken\nvery seriously by aircraft designers. In this article,\nconsequently, I would like to call attention to some\nrather remarkable properties of the oblique wing,\nreport some new discoveries concerning the shape\nof such wings, and discuss their adaptation to a\npractical aircraft.\nTo determine an optimum wing sliape, or a\nshape having a minimum of drag, the designer\nmust first of all adopt some constraint on the\ndimensions of the wing. Thus in Munk\xe2\x80\x99s problem\nof minimum induced drag the span of the wing is\nsupposed to be limited. With the total lift given, the\ninduced drag or vortex drag is then found to be a\nminimum when the lift is distributed elliptically\nover the span. Furthermore, the vortex drag is\nindependent of the distribution of lift in the\ndirection of flight. If a limit\xe2\x80\x99ation on the maximum\nlift coeacient is recognized and if the skin friction\nis taken into account, the optimum wing planform\nturps out to be a narrow ellipse with its long axis\nperpendicular to the direction of flight.\nFor supersonic speeds, in addition to the vortex\ndrag and the friction, the designer must weigh a\nwave drag associated with the thickness or volume\nof the wing as well as with the lift distribution.\nThese latter components are not independent of\nthe distribution in the flight direction, but diminish\nrapidly and continuously as the length of the wing\nin the flight direction is increased. So the designer\nmust adopt a limitation on the length of the wing as\nwell as the span. In spite of the additional sources\nAstronautics & Aeronautics\n\n66 7\n\nF-2 OBLIQUE-WINGED MODEL IN AMES 11-11TUNNEL\n\nofdrag, the additional constraint, and the tact that\nthe flow equation is now hyperbolic instead of\nelliptic, the subsonic elliptic wing reappears as the\noptimum for supersonic speeds. The wing merely\ntakes up the greatest \xe2\x80\x9csubsonic sweep\xe2\x80\x9d angle\npermitted by the constraints. The minimum drag\nagain occurs when the spanwise loading is elliptical\nand when the thickness-chord ratio of the wing\nsections falls off elliptically toward the tips.\xe2\x80\x99 ,6\nThe optimum supersonic wing planform thus\ndoes not have the bilateral (mirror) symmetry of the\nsubsonic wing. It is easy to show that the optimum\nthin planar wing cannot have the usual arrow or\ndelta form. According to the reversibility theorems\nof Karman and Hayes a given distribution of lift or\nvolume must have the same wave drag when flying\nin the opposite d i r e ~ t i o n-. ~According to Munk\xe2\x80\x99s\ntheorem the vortex drag must be the same also.\nHence, if the arrow wing were the optimum, the\nreversed arrow would also be the optimum.\nThe reversibility theorems thus indicate that an\noptimum shape should have fore and aft symmetry,\ni.e., should look the same for either direction of\nflight. The oblique ellipse satisfies this criterion,\nhaving both longitudinal and lateral symmetry but\nnot bilateral symmetry. The indication of fore and\naft symmetry is certainly remarkable since neither\nthe supersonic flow field nor the local distribution\nof the drag shows this kind of symmetry. Smalldisturbance theory identifies a limitation here.\nLocal details of the airfoil section shape are\nstrongly influenced by nonlinear effects, and are, of\ncourse, not reversible.\nDecember 1972\n\n668\n\n40\n\n-\n\nF-1 Lift-drag ratios\nof oblique-winged\nmodel as determined\nin the NASA-Ames 11-\n\n.7\n\n.\n8\n\n.9\n\n1\n.\n0\nM\n\n1.1\n\n1.2 1.3\n\n1.4\n\nWind-tunnel experiments at NASA Ames\nResearch Center have specifically tested the\nforegoing theoretical predictions (F-1). The wing\nhas a quasi-elliptic planform of 10-to-1axis ratio\n(aspect ratio 12.7). It was attached in the high wing\nposition to a fuselage of 12-to-1 fineness ratio. The\nairfoil sections, 10% thick, were derived by the\nconventional NACA \xe2\x80\x9c4-digit\xe2\x80\x9d formula. To\nmaintain the desired symmetry of the lift\ndistribution in the yawed position, the wing was\nconstructed without twist but with a calculated\namount of upward curvature, Le., a \xe2\x80\x9ccurvilinear\ndihedral\xe2\x80\x9d in the unyawed position. The wing thus\nhas bilateral syrimetry in the unyawed position.\n\nWith the wing in the oblique positions the\ncurvilinear dihedral has an aerodynamic effect\nequivalent to that of twist.\nA photo here (F-2) shows the elliptic wing-body\nmodel in the Ames 11-ft supersonic tunnel. The\ntests confirmed the theoretical predictions in a very\nsatisfactory way. With the wing straight the\nmaximum lift-drag ratio L/Dmax exceeded 30 to 1\nat Mach numbers (M) up to 0.7, but fell abruptly to\n11 at M = 0.8. The wing was then turned to 45 deg\na d L/Dmax increased to 20 at M = 0.98. At M =\n1 4 and a wing angle of 60 deg, LID was\napproximately 11. In every case these values run\nsignificantly higher than those previously obtained\nwith arrow wing or delta wing-body combinations.\nSince the oblique wing does not have the\ncustomary bilateral symmetry, questions of\n\n7\n\nF-3\n\nRADIO-CONTROLLED FLYING MODEL\n\nF-4\n\nOBLIQUE WINGED AIRCRAFT\n\nstability and control immediately present\nthemselves. Perhaps the earliest experiments on the\ncontrollability of such a configuration were made\nby H. M. Drake and J. P. Campbell in the NACA\'s\nFree Flight Tunnel at Langley Field.4 They found\nthat the oblique-winged model did not have the\nlateral rolling oscillations characteristic of sweptwing models and showed satisfactory stability and\ncontrol up to wing angles of 50 deg. At 60 deg\nhowever, the ailerons become ineffwtive and\nlateral control could not be maintained.\nWith the wing kt at a large angle, the ailerons\nare in a position to cause a relatively large pitching\nmoment in addition to their normal rolling action.\nCampbell and Drake found, however, that aileron\ndeflection in free flight did not produce observable\npitching motions. Evidently the rolling motion\nquickly cancels the unsymmetrical lift distribution\nproduced by the ailerons an6 the resulting pitching\nmoment.\nTo gain further experience in the control and\nstability of oblique winged aircraft, I have made\nand tested radio-controlled flying models, taking\nadvantage of the highly sophisticated techniques\nand equipment developed in recent years by modelairplane builders. Photos (F-3 and F-4) show one of\nthe models. The radio control9 gives linear,\nproportional deflection of all surfaces and in\naddition permits variation of the wing skew angle\nin flight. Takeoffs and landings were made with the\nwing straight. An enlarged 16-mm movie frame (FF-5\n\nENLARGED 16-MM MOVIE FRAME OF R. C.\n\nMODEL IN FLIGHT\n\nAstronautics & Aeronautics\n\n669\n\n5)shows the model in flight with the wing at 45 deg.\nBurnett L. Gadeberg of Ames controlled the\nmodel.\nVariations of wing angle up to and beyond 45\ndeg produced no apparent changes in stability and\nonly a slight change in lateral trim-requiring a 1or 2-deg offset of the ailerons. Elevatoc and aileron\neffectiveness remained normal and we observed no\nchange in longitudinal trim.\nOrdinary maneuvers such as loops and rolls were\nperformed without difficulty at wing angles of 45\ndeg. Coupling between longitudinal and lateral\nmotions did not appear in aileron rolls, but was\nquite apparent in the response to elevator control.\nThus loops performed with the wing at 45 deg\nappeared to take the form of a 45-deg helix,\nindicating that the rotation produced by the\nelevator tends to align with the long axis of the\nwing. With the left tip forward, use of the elevator\nin a left turn tended to steepen the bank angle.\nAnalysis shows that in this case a certain amount of\naileron deflection must be employed with the\nelevator to prevent banking toward the forward tip.\nVarying the sweep by turning the wing as a whole\nhas several practical advantages over the usual\n\xe2\x80\x9cswing wing\xe2\x80\x9d design. It keeps the wing structure\ncontinuous across the pivot and makes the primary\nload on the pivot tension. With separate wing\npanels pivoted at the root, however, much greater\nloads develop on the pivots (F-6). Also, sweeping\nthe wing panels back for high-speed flight\ndisplaces the center of lift rearward, compounding\nthe normal rearward center-of-pressure shift at\nthese speeds. Turning the wing as a whole,\nhowever, does not displace the centroid of area\nrelative to the center of gravity (F-7). Even with\nfixed geometry the structure of the bilaterally\nsymmetric wing is less favorable because of the\nunbalanced torsion at the wing root. The\nunbalanced torsion may be equated approximately\nto increase in beam length for the swept wing (F-8).\nFinally, conforming to the \xe2\x80\x9carea rule,\xe2\x80\x9d the swept\nwing requires a rather localized and deep\nindentation of the fuselage. The optimum fuselage\nshape for the oblique wing, however, is much more\nnearly cylindrical (F-9).\nThe artist\xe2\x80\x99s rendering on the last page of\nthis article shows a conceptual version of a longrange supersonic transport utilizing the oblique\nwing. By attaching the wing to the fuselage so that\nit can be turned to different angles, flight at\ndifferent Mach numbers can be made with the\nutmost efficiency. Thus, for overland flights at\nspeeds slow enough to avoiZl the sonic boom (M 1.01.2) the wing angle must be 45-55 deg. For\noverwater flights at P 1.4, 60-65 deg would be\nd\nneeded. It is anticipated that landings and takeoffs\nwould be made with the wing in the straight\nDecember I972\n\n670\n\nF-6 CONTINUOUS WING STRUCTURE; NO\nBENDING LOAD ON PJVOTS\n\nF-7 CENTROID OF LIFTING AREA NOT DISPLACED\nBY ROTATION\n\nF-0\n\nSTRAIGHT-BEAM STRUCTURE.\n\nF-9\n\nSMOOTH AREA DISTRIBUTION FOR FUSELAOE\n\nConcept of a pivoting-wing SST for commercial operations.\n\nposition. With a straight wing of high aspect ratio,\nthe energy required for takeoff should be less than\nthat required by conventional subsonic jets and\nabout one-fourth that required by current\nsupersonic transports. And limiting the maximum\ncruise Mach number to 1.4 will permit the use of\ninherently quiet fanjet engines. Thus it seems that\na design of the type considered could effectively\nmeet current demands for voiding sonic boom and\nreducing noise around airports.\nReferences\n1. Jones, R.

The\nsecond w i n g t e s t e d (wing number 2, W ) had an a i r f o i l section ( f i g . 3 ( a ) )\n2\ndesigned using a hodograph method t o obtain a shock-free supersonic zone\nover the upper surface. The t h i r d wing t e s t e d (wing number 4, Wb) had a\nsubkonic a i r f o i l section ( f i g . 3(b)) designed f o r a l i f t coefficient of\n1.3 at a Mach number of 0.60.

Among the\nnoteworthy r e s u l t s o r these experiments are t h e exceptionally high l i f t drag r a t i o s obtained i n t h e transonic and low supersonic speed ranges.\n\n681\n\nLift-to-drag r a t i o s f o r the three Wings are sham i n figures 4 through 7\nf o r t h e t e s t Mach numbers and wing-sweep angles. Wing number 2 shows a\nmaximum L/D value of 31 f o r M = 0.80 and zero wing sweep ( f i g . 4, pg. 21).\nWing numbers 1 and 4 both had a m a x h u m L/D value of 1 a t M = 1.40 and\n1\n60\xc2\xb0 of wing sweep ( f i g . 7, pg. 140),\nWing number 2, which w a s designed t o operate with shock-free supersonic flow over the upper surface showed the expected behavior. A t zero\n.0\nwing sweep t h i s a i r f o i l extended the useful Mach d e r fram 0 7 t o appraXimately 0.80. A t 60\xc2\xb0 sweep, however, the crosswise component of Mach number\nat M = 1.40 i s only 0.70, not s u f f i c i e n t t o achieve the design condition\nof t h i s wing. Further refinement of a i r f o i l . selection f o r such oblique\nwings w i l l depend on the extansion of three dimensional w h g theory beyond the linearized formulas now i n use and probably also on more d e t a i l e d\nwind tunnel studies.\n\n-\n\nAnother noteworthy feature of the t e s t results i s the remarkably\ns m a l l s h i f t of center of pressure f o r wing sweep variations from Oo t o\nComparing the pitching moment of the straight wing a t M = 0 7 ( f i g .\n.0\n60\xc2\xb0.\n4, pg. 9 ) with that of the same wing turned 60\xc2\xb0 shows only moderate changes\ni n s p i t e of the f a c t t h a t the fore and a f t dimension (streanwise chord)\nof the wing increased almost ten-fold when the wing w a s swept.\nA similar result can be observed i n the r o l l i n g moment measurements. Figure 4, page 13 shows r o l l i n g moments measured on the wings i n\nthe unyawed position. Presumably such moments a r i s e from accidental\nmanufacturing irregularities o f the models. Figure 7, page 104 shows\nr o l l i n g moments of the same wings turned 60\xc2\xb0. I n the normal f l i g h t range\nthese are only s l i g h t l y greater than those developed on the straight,\nsupposedly symmetrical wings. A t l a r g e r angles of attack. however,\ne f f e c t s of premature s t a l l i n g of the downstream t i p are observed on the\noblique wings. This behavior may be compared with the premature t i p stalling encountered w i t h more conventional swept-back wings. With conventional\nswept-back wings s t a l l i n g of the t i p s causes t h e airplane t o p i t c h up.\nWith the oblique wing only one t i p stalls and the airplane may be expected\nt o roll.\n\nAmes Research Center\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nMoffett Field, California 94035\n\n682\n\nApril 2, 1973\n\n1\n.\n\nGraham, Lawrence A.; Jones, Robert T.;\n\nand Boltz, Frederick W.:\n\nAn Ekperirnental Investigation of an Oblique-Wing and Body Cornbination at Mach Numbers Between 0.60 and 1.4.

Operation just below sonic ground\nspeed eliminates the sonic boom associated with\noverland supersonic flight. As shown in F-2 (from\nRef. 4) the shock fronts curve slightly as they\nprogress to lower altitude. This curvature, caused\nby the change in speed of sound with temperature,\nestablishes the maximum speed at which a transonic transport can fly without producing a boom\nat ground level. When the shock front becomes\nvertical the boom does not extend to the ground;\nthis would permit boom-free flight at speeds nearly\n50% greater than subsonic jets make today-a\nf\nsaving o some 2 hr 012 east-to-west and I hr on\nwest-to-easttranscontinental U.S.\njlights.\nThe aerodynamic characteristics of all five\nconfigurations were developed using similar\nprocedures. The planform parameters were\nselected to exploit the aerodynamic benefits of each\nconcept. The wing thickness distributions were\nderived from past weight-drag tradeoff studies on\ntransonic transports. The camber and twist\ndistributions were developed by linear theory. The\nbody designs for all configurations were area-ruled\nto yield minimum cruise drag. The nacelle shape\nJanuary 1974\n\n852\n\nOBLIQUE WING\nTWIN FUSELAGE\n\nOBLKlUE WING\nSINGLE FUSELAGE\n\nand location was strongly influenced by the engine\nsize and the configurationalarrangement.\nEngine performance, size, and weight\ncharacteristics were consistent with the results of\nthe Advanced Transport Technology (ATT) study.5\nEngine selection was based on an engine-bypassratio tradeoff study. The penalty of reducing the jet\nnoise by increasing bypass ratio was compared to\nthe penalty associated with jet suppression of\nlower-bypass-ratio installation;. A bypass-ratio-of1 engine with jet suppression .was selected for all\nconfigurations as the most efficient means of\nachieving low noise levels.\nThe swept-wing,variable-sweep wing, and deltawing configurations had the advantage of considerable previous study; and it seems probable\nthat the arrangement of landing gear, engine, etc.\nwas near the optimum in those cases.\nThe oblique-winged aircraft introduced some\nnew problems, and considerable effort was devoted\nto finding a good general arrangement. The emphasis was on the engine and landing-gear\nplacement. There was considerable flexibility in\nlocating the landing gear because takeoff rotation\nand high-angle landing flare were not required.

At a sufficiently\nhigh flight speed or dynamic pressure the\naerodynamic destabilizing force can overpower the\nstructural stiffness, leading to aeroelastic\ndivergence.\nThe behavior of the oblique wing differs from the\nbilaterally symmetric swept-forward wing\xe2\x80\x99s: the\ncoupled rolling motion exerts a stabilizing influence.

At zero flight\nspeed (or, equivalently, zero dynamic pressure) the\nfrequency of the unrestrained airplane as well as\nboth wings of the restrained airplane was 0.93\nHertz. As the speed was increased, the damping\nratio initially increased.\nWith the fuselage clamped, the frequency of the\nforward wing decreased while the frequency of the\naft wing increased. The damping ratio of the\nforward wing decreased rapidly at higher speeds.\n(The so-called \xe2\x80\x9cstatic\xe2\x80\x9d divergence speed is the\nspeed at which both the frequency and damping\nratio become zero.)\n\nF-3 OBLIQUE-WING AIRPLANE\n\nwing combined with rolling motion.\nF-6 illustrates the dynamic model used to study\nthe aeroehstic stability of the oblique wing.

As speed was increased, the\nfrequency decreased and the bending deflection of\nthe forward wing increased relative to the aft wing.\nThe wing-bendmg deflections introduced roll\nparticipation into the oscillation. The oscillatory\naeroelastic instability occurred at a higher speed\nthan the speed at which the clamped fuselage static\ninstability occurred.\nAnalyses of aeroelastic behavior which assume\nthat the fuselage is clamped at the wing root appear to be conservative for most oblique-wing\n\nconfigurations. The aspect-ratio-12.7oblique,wing\ndesigned for strength alone became unstable at\nabout 90% of the airplane\'s speed. FAA criteria\nrequire stability up to 120% of the design speed. It\nis evident that a wing of this high an aspect ratio\nwould require considerable additional structure for\nstiffness.\nReducing the aspect ratio to 10.2 (8:l ellipse)\nimproved this situation considerably. F-8 compares\nthe stability of strength-designed aluminum and\ngraphite-epoxy wings of aspect ratio 10.2. The\naluminum wing designed, for strength alone still\ndid not satisfy the requirement for aeroelastic\nstability; it would have to be stiffened with more\nmaterial to improve the stability. On the other\nhand, the graphiteepoxy wing designed for\nstrength alone had adequate stability.\nThe advantage of using graphite-epoxy rather\nthan aluminum for construction of an oblique\nwing, and the importance of aspect ratio, can be\nseen in F-9.A graphite-epoxywing satisfying only\nthe strength requirements offers about 2070 weight\nadvantage. Considering the aeroelastic stability\nindicated, the graphite-epoxy should have an even\ngreater advantage over aluminum. Reducing the\naspect ratio of the wing gave lower weight and\nimproved stability. These results, however, should\nnot be considered as the last word since only an\nelliptic planform was included in this study.\nAstronautics & Aeronautics\n\n855\n\n856\n\n4\n\n900\n\n700\n\nF-10 GROSSWEIGHT\nSUMMARY\n\n5\n\nn\n\n500\n\n0\n\na\n0\n\nPAYLOAD = 40.000 LE\nRANGE -30M)NMI\nMACH I1.2\n\n400\n\n300\n\n2\n\n:200\n+\n\n100\n0\n\nF-11 WEIGHT\nCOMPARISON\n\n0\n\nMACH = 1.2\n\nALTITUDE = 40 000 FT\n\nLIFT COEFlClENT = 2 6\n\n4\n4-]\nnnn\n\nc-"\n\nI - -\n\n8.88\n\n9.25\n\n~\n\n12.66\n\n9.44\n\n,030\n\nF-12 CRUISEDRAG\nCOM PARIS0N\n\n,025\nLIFT\n\n857\n\nFurther planform studies considering the\ndistribution of mass and stiffness as well as the\naerodynamic characteristics of the wing would\nseem to be most important.\nMinimum gross weight (F-10) required to\nperform the 3000-n. mi. mission was determined\nfor airplanes based on the five configurational\nconcepts in this study. Additional work established\nthe gross weight penalty for noise reduction.\nSubstantially lower gross weights were required\nfor the delta-wing and single-body, oblique-wing\nconfigurations than for any of the others. The\ndelta-wing configuration had the advantage of a\nlow structural weight and thus a low operating\nempty weight, as shown in F-11. The single-body,\noblique-wing airplane (F-10) had a smaller gross\nweight because of its lesser fuel requirements. It is\ninteresting to note that the structural weight\npenalty of the oblique wing was not primarily\nassociated with the peculiar features of the design\nnor the variable geometry, but rather it was the\nresult of the basic strength requirements of a highaspect-ratio wing.\nThe single-bodyoblique wing has the advantage\nin aerodynamic efficiency, as shown by the cruisedrag comparison in F-12. The effect of the higher\naspect ratio in reducing drag due to lift is quite\nevident for the oblique-wing configurations.\nAnother major difference in drag of the configurations was found to be the wave drag due to\nvolume. The double-pod installation was primarily\nresponsible for the high wave drag on the fixedand variable-sweep-wing configurations. The low\nwave drag of the single-body oblique wing reflects\nthe integrated body-nacelle arrangement and the\ninherent characteristics of the oblique wing.*\nF-13 describes the impact on takeoff gross\nweight of achieving lower noise levels by enginenacelle treatment. The takeoff-gross-weight increase reflects weight added for acoustical\ntreatment and the associated engine-performance\nlosses. Only the oblique-wing configurations could\nachieve a noise level of FAR 36 minus 15EPNdB.\nThis technically orientated study has yielded, we\nbelieve, a realistic performance comparison of the\nfive wing-planform concepts and gives insight into\nareas unique to the oblique-wing configuration.\nThe oblique wing offers desirable performance, but\nfurther analysis and * wind-tunnel work will be\nneeded to develop a rounded picture of its\npotential.

Further development studies supported by\nwind-tunnel tests will be needed to develop the full\npotential of the oblique-wing concept.

Jones*\nNASA Ames Research Center\n\nSUMMARY\nThe avoidance of sonic booms places a constraint on aircraft design and can lead to unusual\nnew configurations. From a comparison among\nseveral candidate designs, it is shown that an\noblique winged aircraft offers many advantages\nwhen structure, stability, flight efficiency, and\nairport noise are considered jointly.\nTo avoid the sonic boom, overland flights\nmust be limited to a subsonic ground speed, Le.\napproximately 1200 km per hour. Since the\nspeed of sound a t low levels is normally 160\nkm/hr faster than it is a t flight altitudes the airplane must fly supersonically in its own medium\nin order t o reach this overland speed limit.\nUnder standard conditions the flight Mach number is about 1.15. However, the flight speed for\nconstant ground speed varies considerably with\nmeteorological conditions.\nWith a strong headwind aloft and a high\ntemperature a t ground level the aircraft Mach\nnumber may be as high as 1.3. Under these conditions the wave\'s made by the airplane are refracted by wind and temperature gradients, become vertical and disappear before reaching the\nground (Figure 1). Under other (exceptional)\nconditions even a subsonic airplane might produce a sonic boom. Flying down wind in a fast\njet stream the lifting pressure may be transmitted to a region where the relative velocity is\nsupersonic.\nMore complete analyses of flight conditions\nand schedules at the sonic boom speed limit will\nbe found in References (1)and (2). It appears\nthat east to west flights across the US could be\nshortened by two hours and west to east flights\nby about one hour. Flight a t constant ground\nspeed, of course, tends to equalize schedules in\nall directions.\n?Presented at the Quarter Century Symposium, University of\nToronto,on the 1st April, 1974.\n\n\'Senior Scientist\n\nAn airplane designed for such service\nshould be capable of efficient flight at various\nspeeds from subsonic to supersonic. Unfortunately, flight a t supersonic speed entails some loss\nof aerodynamic efficiency. However, the loss a t\ntransonic and low supersonic speeds need not be\nas great as the loss a t higher supersonic,speeds.\nIt seems possible that the increased utilization of\nthe aircraft and the time saving for the passengers could make up for a moderate increase of\nenergy consumption per mile of flight.\nThe specific range Rsp of an airplane in payload pound-miles per pound of fuel (or kilogramkilometers per kilogram) is given by\n\nRsp = Ro X q X L/D X\n\n..payload\n\n1x1\n\nairplane\n\nHere Ro is the specific range corresponding to\nthe thermal energy content of the fuel - about\n2700 miles or 4400 kilometers for kerosene (Le.\none kilogram of kerosene contains enough energy to exert a force of one kilogram for a distance\nof 4400 kilometers). L/D is the aerodynamic lift\nto drag ratio of the airplane, typically 15 t o 20\nor higher in the subsonic range (below M = 0.8)\nand 7 to 1 0 in the supersonic range. q is the conversion efficiency of thermal energy to thrust.\nWith the development of the fan jet engine it has\nbecome possible to obtain a conversion efficiency q of 40 percent or more over a wide range of\nspeeds - subsonic or supersonic.\nThe quantities displayed in the formula are\nnot, of course, independent. Thus, a loss in aerodynamic L/D such as occurs at supersonic speed\nwill call for a greater fuel load and hence a smaller ratio of payload to gross weight. Similarly,\nmeasures taken to increase the aerodynamic\nefficiency usually result in increased structure\nweight.\nIt is important t o note that the basic equation for energy economy does not contain the\nflight speed directly but only indirectly as it\nmay affect the L/D or other factors.

Following the above relations,\ncurrent subsonic jets could get 60 or more passenger miles per gallon, though they have often\noperated profitably in the range 20 to 30 PMPG.\nAt transonic and low supersonic speeds it appears that with suitable design one could a t least\nequal\' or exceed the latter figure.\nThe l s of lift/drag ratio begins a t M = 0.7\nos\nor 0 8 To minimize the loss at higher speeds we\n..\nmust ask what wing shape can give the highest\nlift to drag ratio a t transonic and supersonic\nspeeds? The surprising answer given by aerodynamic theory is that the narrow straight wing\nof high aspect ratio, ideal for low speed flight,\nalready has the right shape for supersonic speeds\nprovided it can be turned so as to move through\nthe air obliquely.\nWith such a long narrow wing moving a t an\noblique angle it is permissible to divide the flight\nvelocity into two components, one showing the\nair movement across the wing and the other\nalong the length of the wing (Figure 2). The\ncomponent of motion along the length of the\nwing has little effect and so the widg behaves as\nthough it were flying a t reduced speed, corresponding to the reduced component of the flight\nvelocity in the direction perpendicular t o the\nleading edge. By increasing the angle as the speed\nis increased the effective component velocity\ncan be kept subsonic, even though the flight\nvelocity is supersonic.\nWhile the theoretical properties of the oblique wing have been known for many years\nReferences (3), (4). (5), it is only recently that\nwe have obtained experimental verification of\nthe theory in the ll-ft. supersonic wind tunnel\na t NASA Ames Research Center6. In these tests\nwe employed rather conventional subsonic wings\nof quasi-elliptic planform, mounted on a slender\nbody (Figure 3). By pivoting the wing on the\nbody and setting it a t different angles of yaw so\nthat the component Mach number remained below 0.7 we were able to demonstrate lifMrag\nratios higher than either the delta wing or the\nbilaterally symmetric swept back wing at all\nspeeds between M = 0.6 and 1.4. Thus, at M =\n-98and 45O yaw w e obtained an L/D of 20 t o 1.\nAt M = 1.4, 6\' of yaw was required and the\n0\nL/D had fallen t o 1 - about 10% greater than\n1\nthat of a comparable swept wing model. At still\nhigher Mach numbers, the relative superiority of\nthe oblique wing over more familiar shapes is expected to diminish further.\nFigure 3a shows the maximum lift/drag\nratios obtained in these tests. The wings were of\nquasi-elliptic planform having an aspect ratio of\n12.7. The results for three different airfoil sections of 10 percent thickness are shown. Airfoil\n1is a conventional NACA "4-digit" shape having\na critical Mach number of . .Airfoil 2 is a newer\n7\ntype designed by Bauer Garabedian and Korn?\nfollowing the suggestion of R.T. Whitcomb. Airfoil 2 was designed for a Mach number of 0.8 and\n\nCanadian Aeronautics and Space J o u m l\n\n86 2\n\nmaintained a liftidrag ratio of 31 a t this Mach\nnumber with the wing unyawed. A t 60" >raw and\nM = 1.2 to 1.4 the highly cambered section No.\n3 was superior, however.\n\nOBLIQUE ELLIPTIC WINGS\nDIFFERENT AIRFOIL SECTIONS\n\n4o\n\nSubsequent studies have shown that the\nwings employed in these tests are somewhat too\n30\nslender to satisfy the requirements of strength\nand aeroelastic stability. By reducing the aspect\nratio to 1 0 and increasing the root thickness to\n12% it appears that the requirements of strength\nand stability can be satisfied with a small loss of U D 2o\n\nL/D.\nThe elliptic planforfn satisfies the condition\nfor minimum drag (Le. wave drag + vortex drag)\nwhen the overall dimensions of the wing are\nlimited. A more appropriate auxiliary condition\nwould be a limitation on the wing root bending\nmoment8. The resulting planform and span loading is then somewhat more tapered than the\nelliptical. The potential gains in this direction\nare now being investigated.\nThe really significant advantage of the oblique wing lies in the ease with which the sweep\nangle can be varied to suit flight conditions.\nThus, during landing, take-off or holding the\nwing should be straight and in this configuration\nthe L/D ratio was approximately 30 to 1 - a\nvalue which could lead to a very low power requlrement and thus minimize the unwanted display of energy in the airport environment.\n\nI\n\n.8\n\nI\n1.o\n\nI\n1.2\n\nI\n1.4\n\nI\n1.6\n\nM\n\nFigure 3a\nOblique elliptic wings differentairfoil sections\n\n-\n\nCan an airplane with its wing a t such an\nangle be stable or control!able in flight? A preliminary answer to this question was given many\nyears ago by J.P. Campbell and Hubert M.\nDrake, who tested an oblique winged model in\nthe NACA Langley Free Flight Tunnel in 19469.\nCampbell and Drake found their model to be\nmore stable against lateral oscillations than highly swept bilaterdly symmetric models. Even\nthough the ailerons on the oblique wing are in a\nposition to produce large pitching moments, n o\npitching motion was observed in flight - the\nailerons producing essentially pure roll. Stability\nand control were satisfactory up to wing angles\nof 50". At 60", however, ailerons became too\nweak for adequate control.\nMore recently the present writer with the\nassistance of Mr. Burnett L. Gadeburg of Ames\nResearch Center has made experiments with\nlarger (6 ft. span) radio-controlled models in free\nflight. In addition to the normal control channels the radio was equipped with an extra channel t o permit variations of wing and horizontal\ntail angle in flight. Figure 4 shows one of the\nmodels in flight with the wing and tail at 45".\nYaw angles greater than 45" were not attempted\nbecause of the speed of the model (50 to 100\nmph) and the difficulty of visual orientation.\nThe results of the free flight tests may be summarized as follows:\ne Changing the wing and horizontal tail\nangle from 0 to 45 in level flight resulted in n o\nperceptible change in longitudinal trim and a\nbarely perceptible change in lateral trim. The\nmodel nosed down and gained speed to compensate for the loss of lift due to yaw.\n\n* Aileron rolls were performed with normal control movements and without appreciable\ncoupled pitching motion - as observed by\nCampbell and Drake.\n* Elevator control w s accompanied by\na\nstrongly coupled rolling motion. U e of the eles\nvator tends to produce a rotation about the long\naxis of the wing - which is oblique - instead of\nabout the normal pitch axis. Loops performed\nby pulling back the elevator took the form of a\nhelix.\ne The coupled rolling motion produced by\nthe elevator results in differing behavior in right\n\nVol. 20, No. 5, May 1974\n\n86 3\n\nPAYLOAD = I S I43 hG I40 WO LUI\nRANGL * 55611hni l3WU NU11\nINITIAL< R U N AlTlTUOl\n\n-\n\n2-2.\n\n32\n.s\n\n1.2*\n\n388283tdS70001\n110726 11\xe2\x80\x99385001\n61221659U1\n\n226796 ISWOW1\n1:13855 1129UOOl\n436 6 147001\n\n280726 16190001\n1468U4 1312600I\n442 2 1476111\n\n21 1828 1467WO1\nI13832 fZSlllGil1\n\n406123 1913001\n\n216184 148600)\n41\n1\n\n226859 ISIOWI\n\n1561131311001\n\n043\n6224 1130)\nS I\nIS54 151001\n\n0 39\nSO75 I1061\n\n2286 11500I\n92\n296 11601\n\n3505 I115001\n\n03\n.3\n622411301\n10 6\n2225 l71U01\n3018 1101001\n\n63\n31711711\n\n261 1141)\n\n+1.8\n\n- 1s.u\n\n+I 4\n\nI3.1\n2.8\n+ 1.1\n\n411\n\n-1u.2\n+ 3.5\n1.9\n+ 1.5\n\n.\n\n89\n3505 I l l S O O l\n\n- u.5\nr1.4\n\n319 6 t344UI\n\n411\n\n2\n\n0 30\n651 2 I1361\n\nI2 3\n2179 171501\n~947196101\n69\n2545l13741\n\n.\n\nFigure 5\nAircraft characteristics and performance\n\nRAMGE\nPAYLOAD\nNOISE\nENGINE\n\nI MACH i . 2\n-REQUIRED\n\n3,000NMI\n40,OOOLB\nFAR 36\nBPRl 0\n\nI\n\nBODY FUEL\n\nFigure 5a\n\nFuel volume comparison\n\nCanadian Aeronautics and Space Journal\n\n864\n\nTAKEOFF GROSS WEiGHT\n( I O O O K G i ( i 0 0 0 LEI)\n\n400 -\n\n.OO\n000 ~\n\n300 -\n\n.1$.\n\n1\n\nPAYLOAD = 18,143KG (40,OOOLB)\nRANGE = 5560 Km 13000NMI)\nMACH= I 2\nPERIPHERAL TREATMENT, (FAR-36)\n\n200I NCLUDl NG\nRESERVES\n\nIOO-\n\n0-\n\nFigure 6\nbeing estimate of gross weights for the five designs\n\nand left turns. Thus, in turning toward the forward wing tip, use of the elevator tends to steepen the bank; for turns in the opposite direction\nthe elevator has the opposite effect.\nWhile unusual control effects were prominent in rapid manoeuvres they were not noticeable in the use of controls to maintain steady\nlevel flight. Hence, the lack of bilateral symmetry though interesting theoretically, may not\nbe important for high altitude cruising flight\nwhere oblique wing angles would be used.\nFollowing our experiments a t Ames Research Center t& Boeing Commercial Aircraft\nCompany has made, under NASA contract, a\ncomparative design study of transonic transport\naircraft intended to operate a t speeds below the\nsonic boom cut-off speed. One of the objectives\nof the study was to determine whether the apparent advantages of the pivoted wing-might be\nrealized in a practical airplane.\n\nFigure 5a. Figure 6 shows the B,oeing estirhate of\ngross weights for the five designs. It is seen that\nthe swept back wing with variable sweep required the highest gross weight for the mission,\nwhile the oblique winged design had the lowest.\nVarying\'the sweep in bilaterally symmetric fashion imposes severe requirements of mechanical\nstreqgth, leading to excessive weight of the wing\npivot structure. In the oblique design the wing\nstructure is continuous across the pivot and very\nlittle additional weight is introduced by the\npivot structure. The analysis did show, however,\nthat the oblique wing would be rather heavy,\nprimarily because of its high aspect ratio. Of all\nthe designs the delta wing configuration gave\nthe smallest empty weight. The oblique-winged\nairplane had a smaller take-off weight, however,\nbecause of its lower fuel consumption. Figure 7\nshows the configuration suggested by the Boeing\nstudy for an oblique-winged transport.\n\nThe study included consideration of four\ndifferent wing designs (Figure 5); (1)sweptback\nwing with fixed geometry, (2) sweptback wing\nwith variable geometry, (3) fixed delta wing and\n(4)pivoted oblique wings. Details and results of\nthe Boeing study will be found in Reference (8).\nProminent in the Boeing analysis were considerations of structural design and weight, including the use of newer composite materials.\nThe oblique wing designs required a new analysis\nof aeroelastic stability as well as the design of a\nsuitable pivoting structure.\nEach airplane was sized to carry 195 passengers for 3000 nautical miles a t a flight Mach\nnumber of 1.2. It was found that this mission\ncould be performed by any one of the five designs but the gross weight and size of the airplane needed varied considerably.

The ef\xe2\x82\xacects of arbitrary\nsmall modiiications of the two-mirror systems are then studied and general formulas are derived for the\neffects of such modificationson the spherical aberration and coma. Spherical aberration is corrected to the\nthird ordsr if the amount of glass removed from one surface is replaced at the corresponding zone of the\nother surface (approximate expression of Fermat\xe2\x80\x99s principle). Modifications i which one surface is made\nn\nspherical while the other is adjusted to eliminate spherical aberration result in large increases of coma for\nsystems having the usual ampliiying ratios.\n\nN the standard forms of the Cassegrainiin and\nGregorian telescopes the curves of the primary and\nsecondary mirrors are confocal conic sections, so that,\ninsofar as geometrical optics is concerned, rays parallel\nto the axis of the system will be brought to a perfect\nfocus at the axial image point. There remains, however,\na slight variation in the equivalent focal length of the\nvarious rays throughout the aperture of the instrument,\nso that the magnification is greater for the outer zones\nof the aperture than for the central part. Such a variation also appears in the Newtonian telescope, with a\nsingle parabolic reflector, and produces the aberration\nknown as \xe2\x80\x9ccoma.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt was shown by A. C. Lunnl that in any combination\nof mirrors having confocal conic sections, the zonal\nmagnification error will be exactly the same as that of\na single parabolic reflector having the equivalent focal\nlength of the compound system. Since the magnification\nerror of a long-focus paraboloid is slight, and furthermore diminishes with the inverse square of the focal\nratio, it follows that the comatic aberration in the conventional Cassegrainianor Gregorianforms is ordinarily\nextremely small.\nPractical experience has shown, however, that the\nexcellence of the calculated properties of these compound-mirror systems is difEcult to achieve in actual\nconstruction. To overcome these dficulties several\nmodifications of the standard Cassegrainian and Gregorian forms have been proposed. Perhaps the best\nknown of these is the construction employed by Dall\nand Kirkham? Here the secondary is made spherical\nand the spherical aberration is corrected by modifying\nthe primary. Descriptions of this and other possible\nmodifications have been given by Allyn J. Thompsonx\nand quoted by Albert G. Ingalls! Recently Yoder,\nPatrick, and Gee6have presented calculations of all the\nthid-order aberrations for an example of the DallKrkham type.\nThe present paper extends the previous discussions\n\nby giving general formulas for the effects of various\nmodifications on the coma of two-mirror systems. The\nformulas are based, of course, on geometrical optics and\nare limited to small apertures such that the fdth and\nhigher powers of the aperture ratio are negligible.\nWithin this limitation they agree with the formulas\ngiven by Schwarzschild for the aplanatic case (zero\ncoma), but show in addition the effects of departures\nfrom aplanatism while maintainiig \xe2\x80\x98zero spherical\naberration.\nConsider frst the unmodified Cassegrainian with a\nparabolic primary mirror p and a hyperbolic secondary\nmirror s (see Fig. 1).Denoting the paraxial equivalent\nfocal length by Fo, the \xe2\x80\x9coblique focal lengths\xe2\x80\x9d Fy= fp\xe2\x80\x99 of\nthe zones y may be found by extending the rays from\nthe focal point f straight through the secondary mirror\nand noting the intersections p\xe2\x80\x98 of these rays with the\nincoming parallel rays. The AbbC sine condition will be\nsatisfied if the intersectionpoints lie on a spherecentered\nand\nat f. In this case the oblique focal lengths Fy, hence\nthe magnification, would be constant for all zones.\nHowever, it is easily verified that in the case of the\nCassegrainian this intersection surface is not a sphere,\nbut is a paraboloid having a focal length equal to Fo.\nReferring again to Fig. 1, consider the conjugate reflecting system formed on the reversed side of the\nsecondary by the extended.rays together with the rays\nextended from the primary toward its focal point f.\nDenoting by A the amplification of the original system,\nit is seen that the concave side of the hyperboloid forms\nthe secondary of a conjugate Cassegrainian system\nhaving the amplification 1/A, and having its focal point\n\nA.

The surface p\xe2\x80\x99 may be considered the primary of\nthis system if the incoming parallel rays are reversed.\nHowever, the only primary surface that will produce a\nfocus at f\xe2\x80\x99 after reflection a t the hyperboloid s is a\n\xe2\x80\x98\nparaboloid. It follows that the Abbe surface p\xe2\x80\x99 is a\nparaboloid having its focus a t f. A similar construction\n(Fig. 2), but with the paraboloidal surface p\xe2\x80\x99 located\nbehind the primary, is available in the case of the\nGregorian form. Thus in each of these cases the rays in\nthe vicinity of the focal point may be brought into\ncongruence with the rays from a simple parabolic reflector having the same equivalent focal length. The\nNewtonian, the Gregorian, and the Cassegrainian are\nthus all equivalent as far as coma is concerned.\nAX, = AX,\nAs was shown by A. C. Lunnl thii equivalence holds\nFIG.

For values of A less than\n1.0 the secondary is concave and with certain proportions approaches a spherical shape.\nIn the construction employed by Dall and =&am2\nthe amplifying ratio is greater than one (convex\nsecondary) and the secondary is made spherical for ease\nof construction and adjustment.

Jones\n\nRefracting elements having aspheric correctingsurfaca near the center of curv&ure are analyzed. As in\nthe case of the Schmidt reflector, such systems can have a wide aperture and a wide field of view; in\naddition, they are free from obstructing surfaces. Being uncorrected for $spexsion, however, the refracting systems are restricted to nearly monochromatic radiation. Typical forms o the correcting surfaces\nf\nhave been determined, both by third-order theory and by numerim1integmtion of exact equations.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn La Gemtriel, Descartes shows how lens surfaces\nmay be shaped to achieve axial stigmatism. The curves\ndevised by Descartes for this purpose have since become known as Cartesian Ovals. Later, Huygens2\nshowed how the rear surface of a lens could be shaped\nto correct the spherical aberration o preceding surfaces.\nf\nThese measures, of course, leave uncorrected oblique\naberrations such as coma and astigmatism. In 1930,\nBernhard Schmidt pointed out that the oblique aberrations of a sphericalmirror could be eliminated by placing\na stop at the center of curvature of the mirror. Since\nthe central ray o a pencil always meets the mirror at\nf\nperpendicular incidence, there are, in effect, no oblique\nrays in such an arrangement. Spherical aberration is\nthen corrected by placing a thin aspheric lens at the\nstop. The correcting lens, o course, introduces oblique\nf\naberratioljs of its own, but since it has only enough\npower to correct the spherical aberration of the mirror,\nthese are reduced to small values.\nSuch a principle, utilizing the symmetry o the sphere\nf\nand with correction at the center o curvature, may be\nf\nadapted to refracting elements as well as to the reflector. Though restricted to monochromatic radiation, such refracting systems have advantages in certain applications.\nFigure 1 shows two dioptric systems of this nature.\nIn Fig. l(a), the thickness of the lens is equal to the\nradius of the rear surface, and the aspheric correction\ntogether with the stop are placed at the front surface.\nThe image is formed in air on a surface whose radius\nis equal to the distance between an axial image point\nand the stop.\nThe author is with Avco Everett Research Laboratory, Everett, Massachusetts 02149.\nReceivqd 8 June 1966.\nThis work was supported by U S Air Force under a contract.\n..\n\nII. Type A Lens\nAn approximate form for the correcting surface in\nFig. l(a)* may be obtained by computing the optical\npath difference between the spherical rear surface and\nan appropriate Cartesian oval. The Cartesian oval\nfor stigmatie. refraction of parallel rays at the rear surface is an hyperboloid of eccentricity\xe2\x80\x99n(n = index of\nrefraction). Expanding the equation of this surface in\nterms of the vertex radius r , one obtains\n5\n\n= a\n\n+ (y*/2r) - [y4/(2r)a](n* - 1)+ .. .,\n\n(1)\n\nwhile for the sphere\nz=a\n\n+ ( ~ * / 2 r )+ I Y ~ / ( ~ ~ ) ~ I .\n\n(2)\n\nThe differencein optical path is then\nA2 = -nl\n\n[y\xe2\x80\x98/(2r)\xe2\x80\x9d,\n\n(3)\n\nand this is the equation of the front sulfate, to the\naccuracy of third-order theory. Somewhat better correction can be obtained if this fourth degree curve is\ncombined with a second degree curve in order to bring\nthe slope of the correcting surface to zero at some\nspecified zone y,,, of the,lens. In this case, we would\nhave\n=\n\n[ ( 2 n z ~ , e ~ s ) / ( 2 r ) l n*[y4/(2r)*l\n-\n\n(4)\n\n, The foregoing relations, determined by third-order\n\ntheory, will not be sufficiently accurate for lenses of\nwide aperture. Therefore, we have programmed the\nexact determination o the shape of the correcting surf\nface on the Avco Everett Research Laboratory IBM\n\n* The lens design shown in Fig. l(a) has b\npendently by R. Gelles in a paper presented\nb\n7.\nmeeting of t OpticalSocietyof America (paper WH 1 ) Gelles\xe2\x80\x99\nreport (as yet unpublished) &ea fieid a b e h d o n e w e s determined by geometricmy t r a m $n,ndsuggests an ihtereatihg application of the Schmidt principle in a spectroscope.\n\n1846 APPLIED OPTICS 1 Vol. 5, No. 11 1 November 1966\n\n919\n\nHowever, the spherical aberration of the refractor i\ns\nmuch greater than that of the reflector, so the power of\nthe correcting surface required may no longer be\nnegligible. Thus, in Fig. 2, the curvature of the correcting surface exceeds that of the main refracting surface for values of y > 0.47. I the aperture i dowed\nf\ns\nto exceed this value, one would expect the astigmatism\nassociated with these zones to be as great as that of a\nsimple uncorrected lens.\n\n111. Type A Lens Reversed\n\nFig. 1 Lenses with correction at center of ciwature.\n.\n\nFig. 2 Type A lens, showing departure from sine condition:\n.\nn = 1 5 , R = 1 0 f(0) = 1 6 6 (see Table I.\n.2\n.,\n.0\n)\n\n7040 computer. Figure 2 and Table I give a typical\nresult of these calculations.\nWith wide apertures and small field angles, the most\nserious oblique aberration will be coma. In the absence\nof spherical aberration, the extreme Gidth of the coma\npatch for a field angle /3 is given by 6 = 38 If(y) -f(O) 1.\nHere y is the semi-aperture, f(0) is the paraxial focal\nlength, and f(y) is the focal length of the zone y obtained by producing the incoming parallel ray to its\nintersection with the converging ray (see Fig. 2). The\ndiEerencef(y) -f(0)is a measure of the departure from\nthe sine condition.\nFigure 2 shows the calculated departures from the\nsine condition for thelens shape of Fig. l(a). It is noted\nthat the sine condition holds to a high degree of accuracy\nfor apertures considerably greater than those accessible\nto third-order theory. Appreciable departures do not\noccur until value of y >0.6.\nWith coma eliminated, there remains an aberration\nproportional to the square of the field angle j Follow3\n.\ning an analysis by Caratheodorya, it is found that this\naberration depends on the slope and curvature of the\ncorrecting surface and, at a given zone y, is identical\nwith the ordinary astigmatism of an equivalent simple\nlens.\nIn the case of the Schmidt reflector, the local power\nof the correcting surface is ordinarily quite small, and\nthe higher order astigmatism is u s d y negligible.\n\nIn addition to the shapes illustrated in the first\nfigure, one might also consider a lens in which the main\nrefraction occurs at the front surface and with the rear\nsurface figured, but nearly flat. Such a surface, however, lacks the essential properties of the correcting\nlens since rather large oblique aberrations arise in the\nconverging rays. Figure 3 shows the third-order\nastigmatism for several arrangements. In Fig. 3(a),\nthe rear lens surface is flat; if is to be noted that the\nsagittal and tangential focal surfaces curve rather\nshrply toward the lens. Such curvature cannot be\navoided by aspheric figuring.\nComa and astigmatism can be avoided by a suitable\ncurvature of the rear lens surfhce, however. The\ntheory gives r2 = rJn/(n2 - l)]. For theusual values\nof n, the second surface has considerable negative\npower, so the resultant power of the lens is rather small.\nFigure 3(c) corresponds to Fig. 1(a); in this case, both\nthird-order astigmatism and coma vanish.\nAs is well knowna.4 aspheric shapes can be found\nfor two refracting surfaces that will eliminate both\nspherical aberration and coma. A free parameter in\nsuch shapes is the thickness of the lens. By selecting\nthicknesses approximately equal to the radius of one of\nthe surfaces, we obtain forms for these aplanatic lenses\napproximatingthe forms illustrated in Fig. 3.

Figure 5 shows such a Huygens lens compared with a neighboring, perfectly aplanatic lens.\nThe small change in shape results in a surprisingly large\ndeparture from the sine condition.

The paper gives,\nby an elementary construction, a system of coordinates which is conformal in a restricted\nregion near the axis of the motion. In such coordinates the velocity of light remains invariant\nf\neven for observers moving with variable velocity. By a particular choice o the scale relation\nthe restricted conformal transformations can be made to reduce to the Lorentz transformation\nf\nf\neverywhere in the case o constant velocity and locally in the case o variable velocity.\n\nN the American Journal of Physics, November,\n1958, Leffert and Donahue call attention to\nirregularities that appear when the Lorentz\ntransformation is extended to problems of\nvariable motion. Figure 1illustrates the difficulty\nalluded to.

In such a diagram\n\xe2\x80\x99\nthe lines t = constant associated with B are\noblique and if they are continued as straight\nlines they will cross, leading to a nonuniform\ncorrespondence of events between the A and B\nsystems.

Thus the restricted conformal\ncoordinates described in a previous communication\xe2\x80\x99 provide\na n especially simple analysis of motion with uniform acceleration, known as \xe2\x80\x9chyperbolic motion\xe2\x80\x9d.%\nt\nConformal coordinates x\xe2\x80\x98, \xe2\x80\x98 may be obtained from\nCartesian coordinates x , t by the tramformation\nx\xe2\x80\x99 +ct\xe2\x80\x99 = F(x +ct)\n\nx\xe2\x80\x98-G~\xe2\x80\x99=G(x-G~),\n(1)\nwhere G is the velocity of light. A variable motion of the x\xe2\x80\x98\nsystem will be determined by the choice of the functions\nF a n d G. However, since a function remains constant whenever its argument is constant, light signals have the same\nvelocity c in both x and x\xe2\x80\x99 systems.\nThe scale factor of the transformation is given by the\nproduct fg, where f and g are the ordinary derivatives of\nF and G. The line x\xe2\x80\x99=O may be taken as the world line of\na particle. To satisfy the principle of relativity in the\nvicinity of this particle, we impose the boundary condition,\n\nf g = l along x\xe2\x80\x98=O.\n(2)\nWith this boundary condition, the functions F and G are\ndetermined so that both the transformation and its inverse\nhave the same scale along x\xe2\x80\x98 =O.\nAs a n example, try\n\n=log (x+ct)\nx\xe2\x80\x99 -ct\xe2\x80\x98 =log (x -d).\nX\xe2\x80\x99+Ct\xe2\x80\x99\n\nBy addition]\n2x\xe2\x80\x99=Iog(x%--G2t2).\nThe world line x\xe2\x80\x99=O is then given by the hyperbola\n\nxz -\n\nC2F = 1.\n\nAfter differentiating Eqs. (3), we obtain\nfg =1/ ( x 2 - 8 F )\n\n(3)\n\nwhich has the value 1 along x\xe2\x80\x98=O. Equations (3) thus\nyields the conformal coordinates associated with uniformly\naccelerated motion. The acceleration here has the value\none light-year/year,2 or approximately one \xe2\x80\x9cg\xe2\x80\x9d ; however,\nthe formula is easily generalized.\nI t is interesting t o note that the gravitaFiona1 field in the\n~ \xe2\x80\x98 tsystem is singular at the origin of the xt system. Such\n\xe2\x80\x98\nsingularities \xe2\x80\x99arise when simple analytic formulas are\nemployed. In the present case, the singularity disappears\nif the acceleration is not continued for a n infinite time.\nAs is well known, conformal transformations in Euclidean\nspace are carried out with the aid of functions of a single\ncomplex variable. Such a conformal map may represent the\nstreamlines and equipotential lines of a fluid motion. On\nusing the customary Q and $ for the potential function\nand the stream function, we may write\n\nc\n\n++=F(x +iYh\n\nThe complex potential for a vortex is given by\np+i$ =i log (x+iy).\n\nThis formula is clearly anaiogous to our Eq. (3) for hyperbolic motion. Thus the conformal coordinates associated\nwith hyperbolic motion in Minkowski space become the\ncircular paths of a vortex motion in Euclidean space.\nNow the vortex motion is merely the simplest example\nof a wider class of fluid motions known as \xe2\x80\x9cfree streamline\nflows\xe2\x80\x9d. The boundary condition of such flows is that the\nscale factor of the mapping reduce to unity along a (free)\nstreamline $ =O. This condition is clearly analogous to our\ncondition fg= 1, along x\xe2\x80\x98=O. Thus, every free streamline\nmay be transformed into a n analytic world line with its\nassociated conformal coordinates. The converse is not true,\nhowever, since the possibilities in Euclidean space are\nlimited to analytic functions of a single (complex) variable.\nT Jones, Am. J. Phys. 28, 109 (1960).\n.\nW.

The velocity of light appears in such transformations as a singular velocity\nrather than as an upper limit for the velocity. A well-ordered branch of the theory exists\nfor velocities in excess of the velocity of light.\nIf the velocity of a point exceeds the singular velocity in an inertial pystem, then the\nconformal representation of the motion is no longer uniform, but contains a folded region.\nHowever, the branching of the transformation may be determined so that the elapsed time\nalong the path of such a motion remains positive.\nKinematic relations on the other side of the singular velocity seem to complement the\nusual results of relativity theory in an interesting way. Thus it is known that motion at\nthe speed of light occurs along a null geodesic, and\'hence corresponds in a certain sense\nto motion at infinite velocity (that is, in the sense of proper time elapsed). The complementary relation is that a motion of infinite velocity corresponds in the same sense to motion\nat the speed of light.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the world of the physicist everything moves, but always at speeds\nless than the speed of light. The astronomer\'s world, too, is filled with\nmoving objects, moving at u < c. In the world of the mathematician, however, anything is possible, provided only that it is a consequence of something else.\nStrangely enough, writers on physics would like to refer the nonexistence\nof velocities greater than light to a mathematical demonstration-connecting it with the transition of the Lorentz factor 1/ dl - u2/c2 to imaginary values, or to a supposed continuity of the conformal scale factor. It is\n\'Research Scientist, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Ames Research Center,\nMoffett Field, Calif.\n(Note-%\n\nFranklin institute i not rrsponsible for the statements and opinions a d v d by mntributom i the JOURNAL)\ns\nn\n\n945\n\nROBERT JONES\nT.\n\nU.F.I.\n\nknown, however, in the theory of Cerenkov radiation and also in supersonic\naerodynamics that the wave equation remains invariant under transformations having the factor l / d F l for velocities u in excess of the characteristic velocity c.\nSeveral years ago N. Rosen\npointed out that different theories of\nrelativity could be formulated for media having different dielectric properties. For an observer whose experience is confined to such a medium, the\nretarded velocity of light c\xe2\x80\x99 = c/n appears again as a limit for the velocity\nto which a body can be accelerated by electrodynamic action. As Rosen\npointed out, a particle might, however, enter such a region with a velocity\ninexcess of c\xe2\x80\x99 (as in the phenomenon of Cerenkov radiation) and its behavior could not be accounted for by such a theory.\nA theory for particles travelling faster than light may thus be viewed\nsimply as a mathematical formality, or it might be considered a physical\ntheory for the inhabitants of Rosen\xe2\x80\x99s c\xe2\x80\x99 land. There is one additional point,\nhowever, and this refers to the elements of idealization in the classical\ntheory. As is well known, relativistic dynamics depends on the linearity of\nthe wave equation and on the assumption of point particles. These aasumptions are enough to lead to infinite field energy, and in the aerodynamic analogue they are just sufficient to give the sonic barrier an infinite\nrigidity.\nIf one of the foregoing points of view is adopted, then it becomes of\ninterest to investigate kinematic relations on the other side of the singular\nvelocity u = c. Following a conventional terminology, such motions, with\nvelocity u > c, may be termed \xe2\x80\x9cspace-like.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor the investigation of space-like motions we restrict ourselves first of\nall to purely kinematic relations, and we adopt the simplest possible mathematical model, namely, conformal coordinates and their transformations\nin two dimensions x, t.\nCONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS IN TWO DIMENSIONS\n\nIn conformal coordinates the velocity of light remains constant for all\nexperimenters, whether moving or fixed. The invariance here is not merely\na local relation, but holds also for finite displacements. Thus it has been\nshown (2) that an expanding light pulse continues to maintain spherical\nsymmetry about its point of origin.\nFigure 1 shows how this invariant property of electromagnetic signals\nmay be used by two experimenters, A and B, to establish identical Cartesian coordinate systems x , t and x\xe2\x80\x99, t\xe2\x80\x98. In our units the velocity of light is\ntaken as unity and a signal pulse is thus represented by lines expanding\nat 45\xe2\x80\x9d. Though A and B may be in relative motion, each assumes that\nthere is no \xe2\x80\x9cupstream\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdownstream\xe2\x80\x9d influence on his signals and sets\nevery distant clock at a time halfway between the times of departure and\nreturn of an electromagnetic signal from the origin-in accordance with\nThe boldface numbers in parentheses refer to the references appended to this paper\n\n946\n\nCONFORMAL\nCOORDINATES\n\nJan., 1 6 .\n931\n\nEinstein\'s well-known rules. We have no need here for the assuqp\nthe electromagnetic velocity is the maximum possible. If a\ntransmission existed, we might still prefer to use electromagnetic signals\nbecause of their supposed invariant property.\nif 4 and B are in uniform relative motion, we may establish a conformal\ncorrespondence between their coordinate systems by means of the Lorentz\ntransformation. In Fig. 2 this correspondence is illustrated graphically by\nan artificial distortion of the I# coordinate system so that its corresponding\npoints coincide with those of an undistorted (that is, rectangular Cartesian) A system. In such a diagram the lines t\' = const \'are inclined so as\nto represent B\'s position at the center of an expanding signal pulse.\nf\n\n1\'\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFIG.1.\n\nCOOrdiMteS established by light signals.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation is of course limited to motion at constant\nvelocity.

The other coordinate points x\xe2\x80\x98 = const,\nthough at rest relative to B, move with varying velocities in the A system.\nFigure 3 shows a correspondence of the type given by Eqs. 1 for an\nexample in which B moves to the right of A at a velocity 3/5 the velocity of\nlight and comes to rest at the time t = 5, t\xe2\x80\x99 = 4. i t is seen that in spite of\nthe motion, B remains at the center of the signal pulse emitted at the beginning of the trip.\n\nFIG. 2. Lorentz transformation.\n\ne\n\n948\n\nIf we invert the transformation (Eqs. l ) , we find that the velocity is\nreversed at every point. Thus, as would be expected, the velocity of B relative to A is the reverse of the velocity of A relative to B. This relativity of\nvelocities is, however, merely a local relation. Reversal of a field of variable\nvelocities does not in general reverse the displacements. Thus if B moves\nthree units to the right of A, it does not follow that A has moved three units\nto the left of B. Similarly, finite time displacements of the two systems are\nnot equal and there arises a time discrepancy, as is well known.\n\nCONFORMAL\nCOORDINATES\n\nJan., r 6 .\ng31\n\nCOMPOSITION\n\nO TRANSFORMATIONS\nF\n\nT o explore the group properties of the transformation (1) we consider\nthree systems A , B, and C, and apply two such transformations in succession.

On the other hand, the value u =\ndoes not have its usual property as an.infinite magnitude but is reduced to\nfinite value by addition of (that is, composition with) any finite value. In\nspite of these unusual relations, it will be observed that the composition of\ntwo transformations corresponding to v2 = -uf yields the identical transformation (that is, ug = 0) except for the singular value u1 = 1. There is\nthus no rest system associated with the velocity 1.\nThe law of composition of velocities has been cited to show the nonexistence of velocities greater than light. However, we find in this law\nmerely an expression of the invariance of the velocity of light, valid for any\nvelocity of the coordinate system.\nQ)\n\nSINGULAR BEHAVIOR OF THE D P L R FREQUENCY\nOPE\n\nConformal transformations do not, in general, satisfy the principle of\nrelativity because of an unsymmetrical scale relation. Thus it is found that\n\nTo make the scale change symmetrical we should have\n\nfg\n\n1\n\n=\n\n-\n\nfg\n\nor\n\nfg\n\nil.\n\n(7)\nThere are thus two values of the scale factor f g which lead to symmetry in\nthe relations A to B and B to A . The negative value corresponds to velocities greater than light.\nOf course, if the motion occurs with variable velocity, one cannot specify a fixed value of the scale factor for the whole coordinate tFansformation.\nHowever, if we identify A as an inertial system then the relation of equivalent scale may be satisfied locally all along the path of B in the A system.\nHence, we impose the following boundary condition along the line x r = 0:\n=\n\n+ 1 where u < 1\nf g = { -1 wherev > 1.\nAs Eq. 3 shows, if the velocity of a motion is to exceed 1 then one of the\nDoppler frequenciesf or g must become negative. The transition to a negative frequency may be readily understood with the aid of a simple wave\ndiagram as shown in Fig. 5. As the velocity increases toward 1 the signals\nfrom an approaching oscillator shift to higher and higher frequencies while\nthose on the receding side become slower, approaching zero at a rate determined by the relation f = l/g. The high frequency received from the approaching oscillator persists on transition through u = 1, but the signals\n\n951\n\nROBERT JONES\nT.\n\n[J.F.I.\n\nnow arrive at the stationary oscillator suddenly and in reversed order. The\ntransition of g from positive to negative values thus takes place by way of\ninfinity (see Fig. 6). The frequency f shows no such singular behavior but\nretains positive values on each side of the value zero at u = 1. The discontinuous change of the scale factor fg from +1 to -1 on transition through\nthe critical velocity may thus be explained simply in terms of the expected\nbehavior of the Doppler signals. The possibility of such a discontinuous\nchange seems to have been overlooked in the literature. Thus in (3) and\n(4) the negative value is omitted in the derivation. In t5) the negative value\nis discarded by an argument based on the supposed continuity of the scale\nfactor as a function of velocity.\n\nFIG. 6 . Behavior of the Doppler frequenciesfand g on transition through u\n\n=\n\n1.\n\nIf we suppose that the path of B involves a transition through the speed\nof light, then several sets of time signals will appear simultaneously in A .\nSince the transformation (1) is expressed in terms of the Doppler shift of\ntime signals, it is evident that the correspondence between x,t and x\xe2\x80\x99,t\xe2\x80\x98 will\nbecome multiple-valued. This multiple correspondence may be seen in\nanother way from a simple plot of the function F o r G. If the derivative of a\nfunction changes sign, then either the function itself or its inverse must\nbecome multiple-valued.\nFigure 7 shows the conformal correspondence for a space-like motion of\nB in the inertial system A . It has been assumed that B remains at rest until\n\n952\n\nJan., 1963.1\n\nCONFORMAL\nCOORDINATES\n\nt = t\xe2\x80\x99 = 0 and then moves to the right of A with the velocity u = 5/3,\ncoming to rest at x = 5, t = 3. This particular example may be obtained\nfrom the previous one for which u = 3/5 by a folding of the diagram (Fig.\n3) along lines x - t = const.\nThough B moves faster than light in the A system, we have nevertheless\nsupposed that the propagation of electromagnetic signals takes place in the\nB system exactly as in Fig. 1. The \xe2\x80\x9cupstream\xe2\x80\x9d propagation of signals in\nsuch a system is, of course, an intuitively difficult concept-but not essentially different from that employed in the usual range of the theory.\nSince we have supposed that the conformal property is retained for\nsuch motions, the point B must at every instant lie at the center of light\npulses emitted along its path. In Fig. 7 the marked x\xe2\x80\x98 coordinates illustrate\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nI\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\nFIG. 7. Conformal transformation, u\n\n=\n\n513.\n\nthis property for the instant t\xe2\x80\x99 = 4. The function g is of course multivalued in this region, but according to our convention the values 0 < x\xe2\x80\x98 < 4,\n0 < t\xe2\x80\x99 < 4 are assigned to the branch g = -2. This convention, which\nmaintains the conformal property, is evidently also sufficient to avoid the\noccurrence of negative time intervals along the path of B in the A system.\nSuch negative intervals, or time reversals, do occur, however, along the\npath of A in the noninertial system B.\nRecently R. Penrose (6) and J. Terrell (7) have shown that the contrac-\n\n953\n\nROBERT JONES\nT.\n\n[J.F.I.\n\ntion of length indicated by the Lorentz transformation is not a visually\nobserved phenomenon. It is interesting also to speculate on the visual\nappearance of a superlight particle. As Heaviside (8) has shown, such a\nparticle would appear suddenly at a point and then split into two\nparticles which appear to recede from each other. This double appearance is illustrated in Fig. 8. In three dimensions the boundary of sensible\ndisturbance expands along a cone behind the body. Such a cone may be\nthought of as an envelope of spherical waves emitted by the body. It is\nreadily seen that any point within the cone lies on the intersec\nsuch spheres and is thus affected by two apparent sources of dis\n\nI\n\n\\\\\n\n\\\n\nFIG. 8.

These relations are illustrated in\nFig. 9, which shows the times elapsed in both A ( x , t ) and B(x\xe2\x80\x99,t\xe2\x80\x99) systems\n\nVelocity V\n\nFIG. 9. Elapsed times at various velocities.\n\nfor a trip covering one light year in the A system. For velocities less than 1\nthe elapsed time along an accelerated path ( B ) is always less than that in\nthe inertial system and reaches a minimum value of zero at u = 1. Travel\nat the velocity of light is thus equivalent to infinite velocity. In our theory\nsuperlight velocities offer no advantage to the traveller. At velocities\ngreater than u = fithe travelling twin of the well-known paradox comes\nback older instead of younger. At higher velocities the elapsed time increases and becomes equal to the light time at u = m. Thus infinite velocity\nin the inertial system is equivalent to the velocity of light for the traveller.\nThese dual relations do not make the world of electromagnetic signals any\nless strange, but they seem to make it more symmetrical.\nREFERENCES\n\n(1) N.

As an example we may mention\nthe heart, which receives and expels blood nearly\nforty million times a year.\nIf the shape of the heart or bulb were given\nprecisely, or if the course of its motion could be\nprescribed exactly, then one might attempt an\naccurate mathematical analysis of the flow,\ntreating the phenomenon conventionally as a\nboundary value problem of a well-known type.\nHowever, the accuracy with which such biological phenomena reproduce themselves can\nhardly justify great pretension to accuracy in\ntheir mathematical treatment. It seems that in\nthese cases one should use the analysis rather\nmore as a guide to the intuition than as a means\nfor producing quantitative results in specific\ncases.\nConsiderable insight into the squeezing bulb\nproblem may be gained by considering flows of a\nvery simple type.

Thus the flow satisfies the boundary\ncondition of a rectangular box whose sides are\ncollapsing toward the x-axis an4 whose ends are\nmoving outward along the x-axis in such a way\nas to maintain a constant volume. Similarly the\nflow satisfies the boundary condition of a\ncircular cylinder collapsing toward the axis or\nexpanding away from it, and the cylinder may\nhave plane ends.\nThe fact that plane surfaces convected with\nthe fluid remain plane and parallel means of\n\nI\n\nI\n\nSuccessive shapes of bulb\n\nFIG.3.

Thus, starting with a\nbulb of arbitrary shape, one may represent\nP\nmotions in which the successive shapes are\nrelated by a simple stretching transformation.\nFigure 3 illustrates this process. In order to\n1\nx\napproximate the condition of a fixed outlet or\nmouth of the bulb the shape must be drawn so\nthat it becomes tangential to the streamlines in\nthe neighborhood of the exit. It is surprising how\nwell a fixed exit can be represented without\nmathematical complication. Figure 4 shows one\nexample.\nOmitting the effect of viscosity, the pressure at\npoints within the bulb will be given by\nFIG. 6.

JONES\n\npressure over an expanding and collapsing\ncircular tube having one closed end. The distribution along the tube is parabolic and in the\nlimit approaches the value given by onen\ndimensional flow theory. If the tube pulses i a\ncyclic fashion the pressure associated with the\nvelocity will oscillate at twice the frequency of\nthat associated with the acceleration.\nThe dynamics of flow within the bulb determine only the gradients of pressure and not the\npressure itself. Hence we may introduce an\narbitrary variation of pressure at the mouth of\nthe bulb and the pressure inside will rise and fall\naccordingly, and will be felt uniformly over the\nsurface of the bulb. The most interesting case is\nthat in which the bulb expels its fluid into a long\nelastic tube such as an artery. According to a\nwell-known theory the pressure at the end of the\ntube will be given by\n\nP = Po\n\n+ P uo\n\nC\nY\n\n()\n6\n\nwhere c is the pulse wave velocity in the tube,\nYOUNG\n(1808, 1809). Here the pressure at the\nbulb exit will vary with the outflow velocity u\nand the pressures given by (3) are simply to be\nadded to this pressure. In the case of the left\nheart the component given by (6) is much larger\nthan the variations of pressure developed by\ndynamic motions within the heart.\nThe horizontal or x-component of momentum of the flow is easily computed since the\nhorizontal component of velocity of each fluid\nelement is simply proportional to x. Thus the\nvirtual inertia or virtual mass of the flow is\nproportional to the first moment of the volume\nof the fluid within the bulb. More specifically the\nvirtual mass is equal to the actual mass times\nthe ratio of the centroid of mass R to the length\nL, i.e.\n(7)\n\nforth along the x-axis without sensible change of\nshape. The virtual mass here is simply the actual\nmass of the fluid within the sac.\nIt should be noted that while the forms of the\nstreamlines and the isobaric surfaces are stationary, the fluid itself may oscillate back and\nforth along the streamlines and the magnitude\nof the pressures will vary in accordance with the\nfunctionfit).\nIt will have been noted also that while the\ninitial shape of the bulb is arbitrary, the sequential shape changes are restricted to those obtainable by affine transformations. However, the\nvariation in time of these changes is arbitrary.\nThe axially symmetric flow does not exhaust the\npossibilities for affinely related shape changes.\nThus if we wish to represent the flow in a bulb\nwhich flattens its shape as it contracts we may\nI\nutilize a flow of the type\n\n$ = a x2\n\n+ By" + y z 2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere a, 8, y are any constants such that\n\n+B +\n\ny = 0.\n\n(9)\nThe successive shapes of the bulb, related by\naffine transformations may be conveniently\nexpressed by the Lagrangian coordinates\na\n\n5 = x ear\nT = yesT\n\n(10)\n\nf=zeW\nwhere (&/at) = f i t ) .\nFor continuity the stretched coordinate planes\nmust contain the same volume as the initial coordinates planes, that is\nXYZ\n\n=\n\n5.14,\n\n(1 1)\n\nand we have from (10)\n\n5.14 = xyz e(a+#+Y)r\n\n+ +\n\n(12)\n\nso that a\ny = 0.\nThe virtual inertia is referred to the acceleration\nat the exit plane L.\nAs an example we may mention the flow in an\nBy placing the bulb at a large distance from initially circular tube which flattens into an\nthe origin, so that 3&L, we approach the elliptical shape.

In this case, the quantities\na, flyy are functions of the time and the flow\ndoes not have stationary streamlines.\nIn certain cases it is desirable to represent the\nflow produced by inflating one bulb inside\net ul.\nanother. MOTJLOPOULOS, (1962) proposed a\nmethod for assisting the circulation by inserting\na long narrow rubber balloon into the abdominal\naorta. The balloon is inflated and deflated\nthrough an external air pipe and expels blood\nfrom the aorta in such a way as to assist the\npumping action of the heart. To represent this\nsituation crudely we may consider the flow in\nthe space between two circular cylinders, produced by expansion and contraction of the inner\ncylinder.\nReturning to our frrst example\n\nwe have already noted that it satisfies the boundary condition appropriate to a circular\ncylinder collapsing toward the axis, i.e.\n+r\n\n=\n\n- r 5 where r = (qy" + z2).\n\n(15)\n\n2L\nSince there is no liquid within the inner tube, we\nare at liberty to introduce singularitiesthere and\nby so doing we can obtain a second flow which\nsatisfies the boundary condition of a cylinder\nexpanding radially.

In this way the boundary layer\ndevelopment in a pulsatile flow within the bulb\ncan be reduced to the problem of shearing motions produced by tangential oscillations of a\nflat plate. The solution of this latter problem is\ngiven in TIETJENS\n(1957) and shows that the\noscillatory shearing motions diminish exponentially with distance from the surface. The decay\nis given by\nexp-(J~m/2rr)~-\n\nTaking p / p = 0.04 for blood and 0 - 8 sec for\nthe period (= 27r/w), then\nylIe= 0.1 cm.\n\n+\n\nCylindrical surfaces convected with the fluid\napproach the fixed cylinder from both sides.\nFigure 7 shows the streamlines of this flow.\nIn the afkely related shapes we have considered that the surface of the bulb moves with\nthe fluid at every point. Thus the flow satisfies\nnot only the boundary condition of normal\nvelocity, but also the condition of no slip at the\nsurface. If the surface of the bulb actually moves\nin this fashion then the flows discussed above\nwill apply to viscous as well as non-viscous fluids,\nsince the potential flows are in this case exact\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. The\naddition of viscosity to the fluid will require\nadditional normal and tangential pressures at\nthe surface of the bulb.\nIt is of interest to estimate the magnitude of\nthe additional stresses introduced by viscosity.\nSince the shearing strains (aulay), (avlax), etc.\nvanish, the only surviving terms in the viscous\nstress tensor are\n\nHence shearing motions decay by the factor l/e\nwithin a distance of one millimeter from the\nwall. In other words, the boundary layer has\ntime to grow to a thickness of one millimeter\nduring the period of one heart beat. The stresses\ndeveloped by viscosity within this thin layer will\nof course be much greater than those calculated\nearlier for the body of fluid within the bulb.\nMore difficult questions are those of the transitionto turbulence andflow separation. Reynolds\nnumbers in the vicinity of the heart regularly\nexceed those found by Reynolds for transition\nin a straight smootlipipe. However, comparisons\nof the flow in the heart and aorta with standard\nhydraulic experiments should be made with\ncaution because of the unsteady nature of the\nflow. It seems doubtful that anything resembling\nfully developed turbulent pipe flow will appear\nin the larger arteries. Transitory separation\naccompanied by the formation of jets and vortices may appear, however, but their prediction\nwill require a deeper study than we have undertaken here.\n\nor 1/4 the Reynolds number based on the length\nof the biilb. Since the Reynolds numbers in the\nvicinity of the heart are between lo00 and lO,OOO,\nwe see that the additional stresses introduced\nwithin the fluid by viscosity are very small when\ncompared with the dynamic pressures.\nWhile the afEne transformations can yield\nrealistic bulb shapes, the requirement that the\nsurface of the bulb move with the fluid both in\nn\nby\ntangential and normal directions is unrealistic.

KANTROWITZ\n\nAvco Everett Research Laboratory, Everett, Mass.\nAbshct-h the technique of arkrio-arterial pumping, a volume of fluid is withdrawn from\nthe aorta during systole and reinject& during diastole, thereby reducing the systolic pressure\nof the heart and adding energy to the systemic circulation. It is found that an upper bound for\nthe effectiveness of such devices is given by the formula\n\nwhere Qhu is the stroke output of the unaided heart and AQh is the increment caused by the\nih\nand\nare\npump w t a stroke Qb. Plu PSu the systolic and diastolic pressures (unaided). APTis\nnormally negative and represents the reduction in ventricular pressure. The division of effort\nof the pump between the reduction of pressure and the increase of flow depends on the physiological-mechanical impedance of the heart. The total effect is, however, independent of the\nimpedance.\n\nARTERIO-ARTERIAL\npumping provides artificial\nassistance to the circulation by withdrawing\nfluid from the aorta during systole and reinjecting it during diastole.\nThe arterio-arterial p-mp may take the form\nof a simple pulsating bulb attached to the aorta\nand may operate without valves of its own provided the natural aortic valve is competent and\nprovided the pump is synchronized with the\nnatural heart. During systolic ejection from the\nheart the bulb is expanded, deflating the aorta\nso that the outflow from the heart is received at\na reduced pressure. During diastole, when the\naortic valve is closed, the bulb is compressed\ninflating the aorta and providing increased\npressure for the systemic circulation. Conventionally, these events are timed by using the\nR-wave of the ECG complex as a signal. This\nprinciple of synchronous pumping is utilized in\nthe Kantrowitz-Avco auxiliary ventricle (Fig.\n1A) and in the technique of intra-aortic balloon\npumping proposed by KoE, Moulopoulis and\nTopaz (see Fig. 1C).\n\nThe action of such devices is obviously complicated by their dependence on the natural\nheart. Thus, the auxiliary ventricle (or balloon)\nmay both reduce the pressure in the left ventricle\nand may permit the natural ventricle to eject a\ngreater volume. The particular division between these two effects will depend on the\nmechanical impedance of the heart as a generator, a quantity which, in turn, depends on the\npathologic physiology of the heart. The purpose\nof the present paper is to indicate that a simple\nrelation for the sum of these effects can be\nderived independently of the mechanical impedance of the natural ventricle.\nWithout trying to settle any physiological\nquestions, it is of interest to attempt to understand the mechanical action of the synchronous\narteriokrterial pump on as simple a basis as\npossible. For this purpose we shall employ a\nsimple \xe2\x80\x9cwindkessel\xe2\x80\x9d model of the aortic system\nand assume linear peripheral resistances. In\nthis model the incremental pressure in the aorta\nis simply proportional to the volume of blood\n\n* First received 25 September 1967 and in revisedform 20 December 1967.\n\n969\n\nROBERT T.

A\nheart supposed to have a very high, or infinite,\nimpedance will eject a fixed volume with each\nstroke and this volume will not be affected by\nthe pressure in the aorta. Thus, in this extreme\nthe excursion of the heart muscle is supposed to\nbe unaffected by the tension developed in the\nmuscle. In this case the artificial reduction of\npressure in the aorta by the auxiliary pump will\nnot lead to any increase of flow but will result\nsolely in a reduction of ventricular pressure.\nAt the other extreme one can envision a heart\nmuscle which develops its maximum possible\ntension on each stimulus, but which is capable\nof greater or smaller excursion.\nIn the more general case the heart will present\na finite impedance to flow and the effort of the\npump will be divided between a reduction of\npressure in the left ventricle and an increase of\nflow. It is interesting, however, that a relation\ncombining the two effects is independent of the\nimpedance.

If the pump stroke occupies a\niinite time interval, then the effectiveness will\nfall below that given by (16).

On the scale of most arteries the whole blood may be\ntreated as a Newtonian fluid with p 3 to 5 times that of water, depending on\nthe hematocrit. Evidently the concentration of red cells contributes greatly\nto the viscosity. It is not surprising, therefore, that in smaller vessels whose\ndiameter is comparable with that of the cells the behavior i not well des\nscribed by simple rheological coefficients.\nIf the flow region is large compared with the dimensions of the cells,\ntheories of the viscosity of suspensions are applicable and serve to explain\nthe increase of viscosity with increased concentration of suspended particles.\nAn excellent and comprehensive review is that by Goldsmith & Mason (1).\nSuch theories follow the original treatment of Einstein in 1905 (2).\nEinstein considered a dilute suspension of spherical particles which, though\nrigid, were free t o move with the fluid and to rotate under the influence of\nshearing motions. After the appropriate translation and rotation have been\nsubtracted out, the local fluid distortion reduces to a flow in which the undisturbed streamlines are hyperbolic. Einstein calculated the Stokes flow about\na sphere in such a velocity field and related the increased dissipation due to\nthe presence of the sphere to an effective increase of viscosity of the medium.\nHis result is\n\ni\n\n1\n.\n\nwhere t is the volume concentration of spherical particles.\nThe surprising thing about Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s result is the large effect of the suspended particles on the viscosity. A simple division of the medium into rigid\nand fluid portions, assuming that the shearing deformation is limited to the\nfluid component, would produce the result\nP\xe2\x80\x98 = P(1\n\n+\n\nc)\n\n2.\n\nfor small concentrations. Evidently the spheres, though they accommodate\npartly to the shearing motion, produce a greater effect than would be expected from elementary considerations. The result given by Equation 2 is\nactually obtained by G. I. Taylor for gas bubbles (3).\nEinstein\xe2\x80\x99s theory has been extended by Simha and others (4, 5 ) to ellip-\n\n977\n\nJONES\n\nsoidal particles. The values obtained for nonspherical particles are larger\nthan those for spheres, becoming logarithmically infinite for extreme proportions. For flattened ellipsoids of 6 to 1 axis ratio (about the proportions of a\nred blood cell) (4) gives\n3.\n\' = B(1\nP\n54\nFor a concentration of 40 per cent we obtain p\' =3p. Taking the viscosity of\nplasma as p = .015, result i p\'= .045. Though the concentration is by no\nthe\ns\nmeans small, it can be seen that there is rough agreement with measured\nvalues.\nTheories of suspensionslead to a linear, Newtonian, viscosity. Experiments\nwith whole blood (6) show, however, an increasing value of p at small rates\nof deformation. Thus, a t shear rates of 1 per sec, the viscosity is about\ndoubled. The stress level at which the non-Newtonian component begins to\nbe evident is thus about 1/10 dyne/cm2. On the other hand, the normal\nstress corresponding to a pressure of 1 mm Hg is about 1000 dynes/cm2.\nThe relative stiffening of the fluid at low rates of strain will lead to 9\nmodification of the parabolic velocity profile in Poiseuille flow, and in the\nextreme case (Bingham fluid) to a blunt-nosed profile or "plug flow." It is\nof interest to estimate the size of this plug in the case of a typical small blood\nvessel. For Poiseuille flow we have\n\n+\n\n4.\n\nAssuming a vessel of radius Y O = 1 mm with h equal to 1 cm/sec, we\nm\n0\n01\nobtain Y = . 0 cm, or loop. The effect of non-Newtonian viscosity is evidently quite negligible in vessels of l mm or larger. The effect on wall friction in oscillatory or pulsatile flow has been studied by M. G. Taylor (7).\nThe anomalous viscosity of blood becomes more prominent in the smaller\nvessels and capillaries, and it is in these vessels that the primary dissipation\nof energy in the circulatory system occurs. According to Zweifach (8) the\ncollective length of capillaries in the human body amounts to about 60,000\nmiles. The chief pressure drop evidently occurs, however, in somewhat larger\nvessels, arterioles, which control the peripheral flow by means of precapillary\nsphincters [see (9)]. A preliminary study of the mechanical properties of these\nsmall vessels has been reported by Y. C. Fung (10).\nIn such small vessels the flow is greatly complicated by the relatively\nlarge sue of the suspended particles, which may occupy the whole cross\nsection of the vessel. In this regime, rheological concepts become inappropriate and one must analyze the phenomena in detail. An analysis of viscous\nflow in a tube with large spherical particles has been given by Wang &\nSkalak (11).\n\nFLOW PRESSURETHE HEART\nAND\nIN\nAND LARGE\nARTERIES\nIn the heart and the larger arteries the flow is dominated by normal pressures and by the elasticity of the vessels.\n\n978\n\nBLOOD FLOW\ne5 x\n\nk\n\n13%\n\nL\n\nFIG.1 Left heart, aorta, and main branches\n.\n\nFigure 1 shows a greatly simplified sketch of the heart and the aorta\ntogether with some of the main branches. Also shown are typical percentages\nof flow to various organs. The total outflow from theheart, as wl as its\nel\ndistribution, vary widely under different physiological circumstances.\nFigure 2 shows some features of a typical pulse of the left heart. Ejection\nfrom the heart into the aorta is remarkably rapid, Mxumng with an acceleration of lo00 to So00 c m / d (Le., 1 to 5 \xe2\x80\x9cg\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99) and with a peak velocity u as\nhigh as 100 cm/sec [see (12,13)]. In spite of this, the kinetic energy of flow is\nbut a small fraction of the energy of the heart beat. Thus p 2 may have a\n/@\npeak value of 3 to 4 mm Hg, while the aortic pressure varies from 70 to 120\nmm. The major fraction of the pulse energy appears as elastic inflation of\nthe aorta.\nPressure developed in the right heart and the pulmonary artery is considerably smaller than the pressures in systemic arteries. The flow energy\nis thus a larger fraction of the total on the right side, but in neither case\nn\ndoes it dominate. The dominant role of the pressure may be seen i the architecture of the arterial system. Branching arteries show no consistent tendency to come o f in the direction of flow, 90\xc2\xb0 being a common branching\nf\nangle.\nSince the flow in the upper part of the aorta occurs in short spurts fol-\n\n979\n\nJONES\n\nEJECTED V0LUYE.C\n\nt ,sac.\nFIG. Typical pulse of left heart.\n2.\n\nlowed by longer periods of near zero velocity, it is of interest to estimate the\nunsteady growth of the viscous boundary layer during this period. Such an\nestimate shows that the boundary layer can grow to a thickness of approximately 1mm during the ejection period. Since the aorta is two or more centimeters in diameter in this region, the flow is evidently far from that described by Poiseuille\'s law.\nThe Reynolds number corresponding to an ejection velocity of 100 cm/\nsec and a diameter of 2 cm is approximately 5000, higher than the Reynolds\nnumber for transition to turbulence in steady pipe flow. However, since the\nwall vorticity has diffused inward only one tenth of the arterial radius, transition in the usual sense can hardly occur.\nFlow near the heart and in the larger arteries is thus dominated by inertial stresses and is not turbulent in the usual statistical sense. Flows in this\nregime are nevertheless greatly modified by the action of viscosity (separation, vortical flow), though they are typically insensitive to the magnitude\nof the viscosity.\nFigure 3 shows the resistance of a sphere, approximately the size of an\nartificial heart valve, plotted against the relative viscosity. Without viscosity\nthe sphere would have no drag, yet a 100-fold variation in p hardly affects\nthe magnitude.\nAlthough the flow in the heart is probably quite irregular, it is nwerthelw\nless instructive to examine some simplified mathematical models of f o in\na pulsating bulb [see (14)]. For this purpose we consider flowsFith a potential\n4 given by\n5.\n9 = ua+ Pr\' w*\n\n+ +\n\n,\n\nBLOOD FLOW\n\nVISCOSITY\n\nFIG.3.

Such flows have the property that initially plane surfaces convected with the fluid remain plane.

Here a= 2, b = - 1, G = - 1,\nand the flow is axially symmetric with a stagnation point a t the prigin. Starting with a bulb of arbitrary shape, successive shapes are obtained by a simple\nstretching transformation. Figure 4 illustrates this process. In order to approximate the condition of a fixed outlet or mouth of the bulb, the shape\nshould be drawn so that i t becomes a tangent to the streamlines in the neighborhood of the exit.\nWith the effect of viscosity omitted, the pressure a t points within the\nbulb will be given by\n\n+ + w\xe2\x80\x9d>lr(Ol\xe2\x80\x99 -\n\nP = Po($)- b/Z)(%*\xc2\xb6I*\n\nPf\xe2\x80\x99(t)\n\n9.\n\nwhere u=&, v =A, w =&.

Pressures\ndue to the acceleration of flow within the heart are thus of the same order as\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cBernoulli\xe2\x80\x9d pressures.\nIf the aorta behaved as a rigid pipe, the inertial reaction would lead to\nexcessive outlet pressures. The elastic compliance of the aorta serves an important function in smoothing out pressure fluctuations from the heart.\nThus the simplest theory of the action of the aorta is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cwindkessel theory\xe2\x80\x9d (15), relating its action to that of the pneumatic chamber\nformerly used to smooth the impulses from fire engine pumps.\nAccording to the windkessd theory, the aorta acts simply as an elastic\nbag or, in electrical terms, as a capacitor. The incremental pressure developed\nin the aorta is then proportional to the volume ejected into it. Typically,\nthe ejection of 50 cc of blood into the aorta will raise the pressure from 70\nmm to 120 mm, or by 62X108 dynes/cm2, so that dP/dQ=(62x108)/50.\n\n983\n\nJONES\nConsidered together with a "lumped" peripheral resistance, the windkessd theory leads to a simple exponential decay of pressure in the aorta\nduring diastole according to the formula\nPa\n\n-\n\nP.t?-U\n\n1.\n0\n\nwhere A- (l/R)(dP/dQ).\nValues for R may be estimated from data given in textbooks on physiology. For a mean aortic pressure of 100X 18 dynes/cmz and a cardiac output\nof 70 cc/sec, the value of R works out to 1400. The time constaht 1/x is then\napproximately 0.9 sec.\nThe windkessel theory gives remarkably good predictions of pressure in\nthe larger arteries during diastole. The inflation of the arterial system is,\nhowever, complicated by the phenomenon of wave propagation and reflection, which involves the lengths of the arteries. The propagation of pulse\nwaves was first investigated mathematically in 1808 by T. Young (16) who\ngave the basic formulation.\nPULSE WAVE PHENOMENA\nPerhaps the most comprehensive recent analysis of pulse wave phenomi\nena is that by Womersley (17). An excellent review o modern work is given\nf\nby Skalak (18).\nAn instructive derivation of Young\'s formula results if one chooses axes\nin which the pulse waves are stationary and the flow steady. Consider a long\nelastic tube filled with incompressible liquid flowing a t a velocity t. Small\nwavelike changes in diameter of the tube will be opposed by changes in the\nelastic tension of the wall. In addition to the pressure developed by elastic\nstress, bulges in the tube will also cause changes in the flow velocity and,\nhence, the pressure developed in the fluid. For small flow velocities the elastic\npressure will dominate, restoring the tube to its initial straight form. However, for a sufficiently high velocity t, the changes in fluid pressure can overcome the elastic restoring tension. At this speed the tube is neutrally stable\nand variations in cross-sectionalarea will retain whatever form is given them.\nThe internal pressure associated with circumferential tension T in the tube\nwall is\nT\n\nP=-f_\nR\n\nand\ndP\ndR\n\n1\nRs\n\n-=-E7\nor\ndP\nE\n7\n_ - 2AR\n-dA\n\nwhere A = TRP\n\nHere E is the elastic modulus, and T is the thickness of the wall.\n\n11.\n\nBLOOD FLOW\n\nTurning to the pressure developed by the motion of the fluid we can write\n\nP\nRC)\n\n= Pa\n\n- (p/2)(c\n\n+\n\n2)\n4\xe2\x80\x99\n\n12.\n\nthat\nA@\n\n-P W\n\n1.\n3\n\nHere u is the perturbation (assumed small) produced by the change in crosssectional area. From continuity we may write\ncdA = - U A\nso that dfi=pc2(dA/A), or\ndP\n-=dA\n\nPC9\n\nA\n\nEquating this \xe2\x80\x9cBernoulli pressure\xe2\x80\x9d to the pressure developed elastically\n(Equation 11) we obtain\n14.\n\nIf the flow velocity exceeds G , then the Bernoulli pressures will dominate the\nelastic restoring pressures and stationary waves will grow in amplitude. I t\nmay be expected that attempts to force fluid through an elastic tube (with\nfixed ends) a t a velocity greater than c will result in unstable distortions.\nTransforming to axes moving a t the velocity - c we obtain Young\xe2\x80\x99s\nformula for the wave speed, Equation 14, in a tube with zero mean velocity.\nMore generally, if the mean velocity is U we find that the waves travel a t\no\nthe velocity c in either direction relative to axes moving a t the velocity\nUO, the waves are convected with the fluid. The pressure is now given\ni.e.,\nby Equation 13 with the sign reversed if we adopt the convention that u is\npositive in the direction of the wave.\nThe foregoing analysis presents the problem in its simplest terms.\nOlsen & Shapiro (19)have investigated several of the nonlinear effects associated with waves of larger amplitude. One interesting result of their analysis\nis that the nonlinear elasticity of a material like rubber cancels the nonlinear\ncomponent of the hydrodynamic pressure, producing a \xe2\x80\x9clinear\xe2\x80\x9d behavior for\nlarge-amplitude waves.\nOur analysis has assumed one-dimensional flow. However, solutions that\nshow the effect of radial motions of the liquid are available in the hydrodynamic literature [e.g., Lamb (20a) p. 4721. Figure 7 shows the effect of radial\nmotions in reducing the speed of shorter waves. A more complete treatment,\nincluding unsymmetrical modes, will be found in the paper by Anliker &\nMaxwell (20).\nSince the arteries are imbedded in tissue, an estimate of the effect of a\nsurrounding medium on the pulse is of interest. Figure 8 shows the influence\nof a surrounding liquid on the wave velocity of tubes filled with the same\n\n~\n\n985\n\nJONES\nliquid. Such an effect simulates the inertial impedance of the surrounding\ntissue, but does not simulate viscous or elastic effects.\nA treatment of the tapered artery based on the assumption of constant\nwave speed c leads to the well-known differential equation used in the study\nof acoustic horns. An analysis of an exponentially tapered artery, on this\nbasis, has been given by R. L. Evans (21). A somewhat simpler analysis,\nadaptable to a conical taper, utilizes the spherical wave equation; Le.,\n\nIn this case, pressure pulses retain their shape but vary in amplitude inversely as the vessel diameter. The velocity, given by d+/dR, shows a more\ncomplicated dependence.\n\nBRANCHING\nARTERIES:\n\nPERIPHERAL IMPEDANCE\n\nProceeding from the large arteries to smailer branching vessels, viscosity\nbegins to play an increasingly important role. A very complete treatment of\nthe effects of viscosity in pulsatile flow has been given by Womersley. In the\nlarger arteries vorticity can diffuse only a short distance into the flow during\na pulse. In smaller arteries, however, the unsteady boundary layer begins to\n\n*\n\nOO\n\nI\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2n-3FIG.7.

As an introduction to Womersley\xe2\x80\x99s results, it is instructive to consider the oscillatory shearing motion of a\nviscous liquid produced by a flat surface oscillating in its own plane. In this\ncase a well-known solution gives\nB\nU.,.CSYCOS (nt - ky)\n15.\nE\n\nwhere R =(n/2v)l/%.\nHere u is the velocity (parallel to the plate), y is the distance normal to the surface, and Y is the kinematic viscosity. For a normal\nheart rate n is about 10. Taking v as 0.05 we obtain R = 10; henbe, the oscillatory shearing motions diminish to l/e of the surface value at y =O.l,or 1 mm.\nFor a vessel 2 cm in diameter the viscosity hardly modifies the velocity\nproiile. Such a thin boundary layer, however, leads to values of wall-shearing\nstress considerably higher than those for steady Poiseuille flow. The shearing\ns\nstress on the oscillating plate i given by\n7=p&k&(acoB\n\n(nt+- 3\n\n1\n6.\n\nand is thus 45O out of phase w t the velocity. For a peak velocity u of\nih\n,\n100 cm/sec, v=0.05, K = 10 as above, we obtain\nT\n-\n\n= 140 dynes/cm\n\n987\n\nJONES\n\nFor an artery 50 cm long, this value corresponds to a pressure drop of approximately 11 mm Hg at peak flow-about 7 times that associated with\nsteady Poiseuille flow.\nOur rough calculation is intended only to give an intuitive picture of the\nproblem. For rigorous theory and results one should refer to Womersley\'s\npaper. Oscillatory shearing motion adjacent to a flat surface is simply a\ndamped sinusoid with surface traction 45" out of phase with the velocity for\nall frequencies. In a circular tube the oscillations are described by Bessel\nfunctions and the phase shift is a function of the frequency.\nFor blood vessels below a certain diameter, the diffusion of vorticity is\nessentially complete at every stage of an oscillatory flow. Since the Reynolds\nnumber is quite small, the flow is dominated by viscosity. In this limiting\ncase the equation of motion is simply Poiseuille\'s formula\n17.\n\nThe continuity relation is, however, modified by the elasticity of the vessel;\ni.e.,\naA\na\n_ - - -ax A ~\nP\nat\n\n18.\n\nIntroducing the relation between the pressure and the elastic distension of\nthe cross section by means of the pulse wave velocity G, we write\n1.\n9\n\nso that Equation 18 becomes\n1 aP\n\n--+p--eo\ncz at\n\na%\nax\n\n20.\n\nEliminating u between Equations 17 and 20 we obtain for the pressure\n21.\n\nwhich is the well-known diffusion equation. Evidently in vessels of this size\nthe pulse no longer travels as a wave, but is reduced to a diffusion of pressure\nby the action of viscosity. Equation 21 has a one-parameter family of solutions corresponding to a step input of pressure, viz.,\n22.\n\nThe phenomenon of diffusion of pressure is evidently restricted to vessels\nsmaller than 1 mm in diameter. To determine the critical size, we may compare the pressure a t a point along the artery with the pressure that would\narrive at that point if the pulse wave were unimpeded. Hence, we set t in\n\n988\n\nBLOOD FLOW\nEquation 22 equal to X / G . For G = 1000, r = 0.05 we find that the pulse is reduced to one half in a distance of 6 cm.\nPerhaps the most doubtful quantity in the foregoing estimate is the\nmagnitude of c in such small vessels. A constant value of c would correspond\nto a constant ratio of wall stress to pressure and, hence, would give large and\nsmall vessels the same margin of safety. Measurements show, however, t h a t\nthe wave speed is higher in branching arteries than in the aorta. Whether\nthis tendency persists to very small vessels in not known.\n\nAORTIC\nPRESSURE\nPULSE\nSince the collective area of the arterial branches increases with distance\nfrom the heart, the average flow velocity must decrease. Thomas Young\nsupposed that the pulse pressure would decrease also. However, D. McDonald (22,23) and others have shown that pulsatile components of the pressure\nactually increase for a certain distance in going toward the periphery. The\nincrease of harmonic components with distance from the heart corresponds\nto the well-known sharpening of the pulse in the distal radial and femoral\narteries.\nT h e phenomenon of pulse sharpening can be demonstrated quite well\nwith a simple physical model of the aortic system. Figure 9 shows such a\nmodel in use at Avco Everett Research Laboratory (see 2 ) This model\n4.\nconsists of an untapered rubber tube having geometric and elastic properties\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nFIG.9.

Pulsatile flow is produced by an electric motor\nand a mechanical linkage that imitates the ejection curve of the heart. A t its\nlower end the rubber \xe2\x80\x9caorta\xe2\x80\x9d enters a box filled with plastic sponge, intended\nto simulate the peripheral resistance. Aortic and mitral valves are plastic\nflaps. Figure 10 shows the forms of the pressure curves in the aorta for positions near the (rubber) \xe2\x80\x9cheart\xe2\x80\x9d and near the peripheral resistance. These\ncurves show a striking similarity to physiological pressure pulses.\nA direct physical model such as described above has been found useful in\nisolating and studying purely mechanical phenomena connected with the\ncirculation.

About four strokes are\nrequired to build the aortic pressure up to its steady value. When the motor\nis stopped the pressure decays exponentially, accompanied by outflow\nthrough the peripheral resistances. Evidently the windkessel theory gives a\ngood representation of the phenomenon except during the early part of the\npulse, where the pressures are complicated by wave reflections and vary\nwith position.\nBefore proceeding to the discussion of reflections, i t is useful to consider\n\n991\n\nJONES\n\nthe effect of a stepwise input of flow (assumed frictionless) into an elastic\ntube. Figure 13 illustrates this phenomenon. The injection of \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d fluid\ninto the tube sets into motion a part of the fluid already there, creating a\nbulge which travels at the velocity c, greater than u. The new fluid is separated from the old by a \xe2\x80\x9ccontact surface.\xe2\x80\x9d The change in momentum at the\nwave front is pu and occurs at the velocity c, so t h a t the pressure is\n23.\n\nA# = p w\n\nSince (p/2)u2is usually small compared with puc, the pulse is not very sensitive to variations in the velocity profile of the injection, depending primarily\non the volume influx.\nIf A is the cross-sectional area of the tube, the volume flow will be Q =u A .\n\n\xe2\x80\x98NEW\xe2\x80\x9c FLUID\nCONTACT SURFACE\n\n.VELOCITY = u\nAP=pUC\n\nFIG.13. Injection of fluid into an elastic tube.\nThe pressure required is in phase with the flow rate and, hence, the elastic\ntube without reflections and with frictionless flow presents a simple resistive\nimpedance\n\n,\nIn the electrical analogue, Z is termed the \xe2\x80\x9ccharacteristic\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csurge\xe2\x80\x9d impedance.\nTypical values of mean flow to various organs, together with the mean\naortic pressure, may be used to estimate the resistive impedance associated\nwith various branching arteries. Values corresponding to Figure 1 are shown\non Figure 14. It will be seen that the resistance associated with the capillary\nbeds is an order of magnitude greater than the pulse impedance of the aorta.\nFigure 15 shows by means of a characteristics diagram how the aortic\n\n992\n\nBLOOD FLOW\n\nP\nFIG.14.

Thus, the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula gives\n\nThis equivalence may be used to show the relation between the pulse wave\ntheory and the windkessel theory of the aorta. The Euler-Maclaurin series\nwill further provide a first-order correction of the Windkessd theory for the\nf\neffect of finite length o the aorta. As Equation 26 implies, the correction\namounts simply to the addition of the term +f(t) =but to the pressures\ncomputed from the windkessel theory.\nThe integral on the right-hand side of Equation 26 may be rewritten as\n(since At = 2L/c)\n27.\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the aorta. The term uA is then the\nvolume flow and pce/LA is the reciprocal of tlie volume complianceor "capacitance" of the aorta:\n28.\n\nThe integral, Equation 27, is thus seen to be simply the pressure developed\nby static inflation of the tube as a windkessel.\nWhen the origin is shifted to take account of the delay in onset of the\npressure [ t - ( z / c ) -0 or t+(x/c) - (2L/c) =0] and when Equation 26 is\napplied to the downgoing and upgoing waves independently, the formula\n\nP = P&ik&\n\n+4\nw\n\n29.\n\nwill show the steepening of the pulse along the length.

Thus\n\xe2\x80\x98\n30.\n\nwhere Zz is the distal terminating impedance and Z, is the characteristic impedance of the aorta. Equation 25 now becomes\n31.\n\nEquations 25 and 31 are analogous to equations for electromagnetic\nwaves in transmission lines and are most conveniently treated by Heaviside\xe2\x80\x99s\nmethod (25). Using Heaviside\xe2\x80\x99s method we may write\nf ( t - At) = e-AtDf(t)\n\n32.\n\nwhere D is the differential operator a/&. The right-hand side of Equation 32\nis termed the \xe2\x80\x9cshift operator.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9crepeat operator\xe2\x80\x9d is\n\n995\n\nJONES\n33.\n\nwhile\n34.\n\nWith these rules Equation 31 becomes\n35.\n\nA similar analysis yields for the velocity u\n36.\n\nwhere u=u(x, t ) and f @ =pcu(O, t ) . The flow and pressure in arteries are\noften analyzed by Fourier\xe2\x80\x99s series. In this case the terms of the series will involve\nfn(t) =\n\nA,,eint\n\n37.\n\nThe substitution of in for D in Equation 35 will then yield the \xe2\x80\x9ccoiqplex\nimpedance\xe2\x80\x9d as a function of frequency [see (25)].\nExpansion of Equation 36 for small values of L / c yields again the windkessel theory with a correction for transient wave reflections. In this case the\nformula incorporates the effect of an exponentially-decaying outflow through\nthe peripheral resistances by virtue of the reflection coefficients k and k\xe2\x80\x98.\nThe above treatment is frankly heuristic and by no means complete.\nThus we have assumed that the impedance of the aortic branches is purely\nresistive. A more precise treatment would incorporate reactive components\nin the reflection coefficients k and k\xe2\x80\x99, and, of course, more branching arteries.\nA considerable improvement in accuracy might be achieved by treating the\nl\nmain branching arteries as s m ~ l windkessels interposed between the aorta\nand the terminal capillary resistances. Taking, for example, a carotid artery\n(26) gives as the wave velocity 1800 cm/sec, or about 3 times that in the\naorta. Assuming a length of 20 cm and a heart rate of bO/min, we find the\ncarotid artery is about 1/70 of a wave in length. Evidently, even the larger\nbranching arteries may be treated approximately as lumped capacitors. The\ncapacitance will be given by\n\nor about 0.6 cc change in volume for 100 mm change in pressure. Such a\nbranching artery may terminate in a resistance of 8000 (cgs) and the \xe2\x80\x9cRC\xe2\x80\x9d\ntime constant will then be approximately 0.04 sec. Evidently the capacitance\nof the branching arteries, though small, is great enough t o modify the shapes\nof the reflected pulses significantly.\n\n996\n\nBLOOD FLOW\n\nMore detailed treatment of arterial flow leads rapidly to a great increase\nin analytical complexity. Thus, Womersley (17) has calculated the impedance and reflection at a branching artery on the basis of time-dependent\nviscous flow. The actual impedance a t a branch of the larger arteries will be\ndetermined primarily, however, by smaller branching arteries farther down.\nHence, Womersley\xe2\x80\x99s analysis must be continued for several stages to obtain\nthe true impedance a t a branch. For such detailed calculations, the electrical\nanalogue [see (27)] becomes useful. In this connection Jager, Westerhof &\nNoordergraaf (28) have succeeded in devising an electrical circuit to approximate Womersley\xe2\x80\x99s formula.\n\n997\n\nJONES\nLITERATURE CITED\n1.

JONES\n\nIn this article certain hemodynamic phenomena that arise in connection\nwith the use of artificial blood pumping devices will be reviewed. Among these\nare: 1) flows produced by collapsing bulbs, 2) the impedance presented by\nthe aorta, 3) limiting velocities and instability of flow in elastic vessels, 4\n)\neffectiveness of valveless arterio-arterial pumps, and 5 ) wave reflection\nphenomena and instabilities associated with the intra-aortic balloon pump.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nMaintenance of life by an artificial blood pump is an everyday occurrence\nin most large hospitals. The pump-oxygenator which takes over the function\nof both the heart and the lungs during surgery seems, however, to be limited\nin use to a maximum of several hours. Beyond this time one looks for certain\nsymptoms which are taken as evidence of changes in the physiological\nconstituents of the blood, that is, loss of red blood cells (hemolysis) and\nplatelets as well as denaturation of protein components. In spite of this\ndeficiency the pump-oxygenator is considered adequate for most surgical\nprocedures, though not suited in its present form to chronic support of a\nweakened or failing heart.\nPending the development of an ideal total heart replacement, there have\nbeen numerous attempts to provide partial assistance to the heart (see references) for periods longer than the few hours available with the pump\noxygenator. These have generally taken the form of pumps to assist the left\nventricle, since left ventricular function is most critical and evidently most\noften deficient.\n\n1001\n\nFLUID DYNAMICS OF HEART ASSIST DEVICES\n\nSeveral types of left ventricular assist pumps are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nIn Fig. la the pump is equipped with inflow and outflow valves and is placed\nin parallel with the ventricle (atrio-arterial pump) where it may divert all or\npart of the flow around the left heart. By contrast, pumps placed in series\nwith the ventricle may not significantly alter the flow but may be expected to\nrelieve all or part of the systemic pressure from the heart. It is interesting that\nthe series pump may accomplish this function even without valves if it is\nproperly phased with the pulsatile outflow from the ventricle. The centrifugal\npump described by Dorman et a1 (1969) operates by magnetic coupling\nthrough the intact skin and, of course, requires no valves.\n\n(A)\n\nTHORACIC AUXILIARY VENTRICLE\n\n( 8 ) AUXILIARY VENTRICLE IN DESCENDING AORTA\n\n(C)\n\nI\n\nINTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP\n\nFig.1: Heart assist devices\n\nIn order to understand the operation of such devices, it is first of all necessary to gain at least a crude understanding of the function of the left ventricle\nand the aorta in mechanical terms.\nOur first curiosity here is in the flow produced by a collapsing or squeezing\nbulb since both the natural and the artificial ventricles operate in this fashion.\nAs has been shown (Jones, 1969) potential flows of the type\n(1)\n\nWx,Y , Z,t ) = ax2 + Byz + yz2\n\nprovide perhaps the simplest starting point for mathematical modeling of the\n\n1002\n\nROBERT T.

If x, y and z are taken as the initial coordinates\nof a particle of fluid (or of the boundary) we have\n\nfor the Lagrangian coordinates. The Lagrangian coordinates are thus related\nto the initial coordinates by simple affine transformations. Plane surfaces\nremain plane and a bulb of initially arbitrary shape undergoes distortions tha!\ncan be represented by stretching its coordinates in different directions while\npreserving a constant volume.\nFigure 2 shows streamlines emanating from a collapsing bulb together,\nwith pressures calculated by the foregoing method on the assumption of\nfrictionless flow. The motion of the liquid in a bulb does not completely\ndetermine the pressures, but there remains an arbitrary function of the time to\nbe determined by the impedance into which the bulb works, that is, the\nrelation between pressure and flow in the aorta.\nIn a typical case the diastolic pressure in the aorta will be 70-80 mm H g\nand the ejection of blood from the ventricle will raise this pressure by 60-70\nmm. Pressures arising from dynamic motions within the bulb, however, are\nof the order of 3 4 mm only. Thus it seems that very little of the effort of the\nheart is directed against the inertia of the blood but appears initially in elastic\ndistension of the arteries ;later to be dissipated in frictional resistance through\nthe capillaries.\nExamination of the heart cavity shows a surface far from streamlined\nform, with deep furrows (trabeculae) and tendons to support the mitral valve.\nSimilarly, the architecture of the aortic system shows little disposition toward\nflow dynamics as ordinarily understood. Branching arteries often show no\npreference for the flow direction. Here again we find but a small fraction of\nthe pressure in kinetic form; pu2/2is of the order of a few millimeters.\nIn prosthetic heart pumps streamlining does not play an important role in\nthe purely mechanical function, though the flow does seem most important\nin relation to clotting. The clotting phenomenon is at present a dominant\nfactor in the success or failure of artificial heart devices including prosthetic\nvalves and assist pumps. Though beyond the scope of the present discussion,\n\n1003\n\nY\n\nP\n\nf\n\nBULB SURFACE\n\n----X\n\n- __-----\n\nFig. 2: Streamlines and pressures in collapsing bulb.\n\n1004\n\nROBERT T. JONES\n\nthe relation between clotting and flow has become a major item of research\nat our laboratory and elsewhere.\nNearly all current heart assist pumps operate by pneumatically driven\nplastic bulbs. In our experience we have found it essential that the bulb not\nchange its volume by stretchingbut rather by folding. The\na change of extrinsic geometry without altering the intrins\nsurface. The solution appears by reflection of the convex s\nthat progressively larger areas of the surface change from convex to concave,\nalong a singular curve determined by the intersection of the plane. In practice\nthe bulb has finite thickness and the surface bends to a finite radius along this\ncurve. In spite of the concentration of bending strain, bulbs of silicone rubber\nhave very satisfactory fatigue life in this mode of deformation.\nSuch bulbs are occasionally made by fitting initially flat sheets of fabric\nand silicone rubber over a convex form. Here one encounters a problem well\nknown to tailors and known to mathematicians from the properties of the\nTschebyschev net. It seems that such a net (as a handkerchief) can be fitted\nover a convex surface whose integrated solid angle does not exceed 2d.\nThe function of the aorta and the major vessels as an elastic compliance is\nwell characterized by the simplest theory of aortic impedance known as the\n\xe2\x80\x9cwindkessel\xe2\x80\x9d theory (Taylor, 1965). Here the aorta acts simply as a lumped\ncapacitance, and if the peripheral resistance is linear, one obtains an exponential decay of pressure following ejection of a volume of blood from the\nheart.\nFigure 3 illustrates our attempt to make a direct physical model of the aortic system. In medical circles such devices are known by the term \xe2\x80\x9cmock\ncirculation.\xe2\x80\x9d We have found such a model useful in studying and isolating\nthe purely mechanical effects of cardiac assist devices. The model aorta\nis made of silicone elastomer with compliance determined so as to lie within\nthe physiological range. The substitute ventricle is made of the same material\nand is placed in an air tight box so that it can be actuated pneumatically\nby a linkage and piston drive as shown. Figure 4 shows the type of pressure\npulse produced by our model compared with natural pulses taken from a\ntextbook on physiology.\nWith such a model one has control of various parameters such as source\nimpedance of the heart, cardiac output, wave speed and diameter of the aorta,\nand peripheral resistance. In addition, since the aorta is transparent, we have\nbeen able to observe visually the action of the intra-aortic balloon pump.\nlw\nFortunately, because of the high Reynolds number of the f o in the larger\narteries, one is not required to duplicate the detailed rheological properties\nof the blood in such experiments. A rough calculation will show that the\nunsteady laminar boundary layer on the inner wall of the aorta has time\nto grow to a thickness of only about one millimeter during the heart beat.\nSeparation vortices of the order of a centimeter in diameter may be expected\n\n1005\n\nFLUID DYNAMICS OF HEART ASSIST DEVICES\n\nFig. 3: Aortic circulation model.\n\nto persist for two or more heart beats. It should be borne in mind, however,\nthat the dynamic pressure associated with the flow is small compared with\nthe actual pressure. Hence, flow irregularities do not normally have a great\ninfluence on the mechanical performance of heart assist pumps. They may,\nhowever, influence the behavior of artificial valves and, of course, the\nformation of thrombi.\nIn our early effort at Avco Everett Research Laboratory, we sought to\ndevelop and perfect the Kantrowitz auxiliary ventricle, illustrated in Fig. lb.\nThis device comprises a simple compliant pumping chamber which is fitted\ninside a more rigid plastic case. The space between the bulb and the case communicates by a small gas tube through a percutaneous connector to the control system outside the body. The bulb can then be alternately compressed and\n\n1006\n\nROBERT T JONES\n.\n\nLEFT VENTRICULAR PRESSURE\n\nLEFT VENTRICULAR PRESSURE\n\n1 1\n1 l\nPROXIMAL AORTIC PRESSURE\n\nPROXIMAL AORTIC PRESSURE\n\n3 time\n\nDISTAL PRESSURE\nMECHANICAL PULSE\n\n. recondr\n\nDISTAL PRESSURE\n\nNATURAL PULSE\n(Adaped from \xe2\x80\x9cA Primer of Grdiac\nGt heteriut ton\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 1965)\n\nFig. 4: Comparison of pulses produced by model with physiologic pulse.\n\nexpanded by pneumatic pressure from an external power source. Since the\nblood pumping chamber has no valves, it is necessary that its stroke be synchronized and properly phased with the action of the heart. This synchronization was accomplished with the aid of electrocardiac signals obtained from\nelectrodes attached to the heart muscle. By withdrawing blood from the aorta\nprior to systole the pressure required for ejection by the heart can be reduced,\nthus lessening the effort of the heart. After the ejection from the natural\nheart is complete and the aortic valve is closed, the blood withdrawn into the\nauxiliary ventricle can be pumped back into the aorta, raising the pressure\nand supplying energy for the systemic circulation. This technique has the advantage of creating higher pressures in the aorta during diastole and hence\nthe possibility of increased coronary perfusion (in practice the coronary flow\nhas in some cases been observed to diminish, perhaps because the assisted\nheart requires less). If we suppose, for example, that the stroke volume of the\nartificial ventricle Q, is as great as the output stroke of the natural ventricle\nQ, then it is clear that the pressure rise during systole may be suppressed and\nthe pressures in the natural ventricle need hardly exceed diastolic pressure.\nThis special situation requires that the withdrawal stroke of the AV imitate\nthe ejection stroke of the natural ventricle in reverse. In practice somewhat\nbetter results are obtained by reducing the pressure in the aorta prior to\nsystole, permitting the aortic valve to open at a lower pressure and reducing\nthe pressure during isometric contraction.\n\n1007\n\nFLUID DYNAMICS OF HEART ASSIST DEVICES\n\nThe intra-aortic balloon pump (Fig. IC), functions by a similar principle\n(Moulopoulos et al, 1962) since inflation and deflation of the balloon affects\naortic pressures in much the same way as injection and withdrawal of a corresponding quantity of blood. The balloon pump has the advantage that it\ncan be inserted through a femoral artery under local anesthesia. In this case\nelectric signals for timing are obtained from skin electrodes.\nThe reduction of outflow pressure during systole may, of course, permit\nthe heart to eject a greater flow quantity. Hence, the auxiliary ventricle (or\nthe balloon pump) may increase the cardiac output as well as effect a reduction in left ventricular pressure. The precise division of effort between flow\nand pressure will depend on what may be termed the \xe2\x80\x9csource-impedance\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nof the heart. Animal experiments with such pumps indicate that a healthy\nheart has a very high source impedance (is flow-limited). The primary effect\nof the auxiliary pump then appears as a reduction of pressure in the left\nventricle. However, experience with human patients in cardiac distress indicates that the weakened heart may be pressure limited. In such cases the\narterio-arterial pump will act primarily to increase the cardiac output.\nBecause of its dependence on pathology, it seems unlikely that any\nuniversal relation for cardiac impedance can be found. However, the reduo\ntion of ventricular pressure and the increase of flow can be combined linearly\ninto a quantity which may be thought of as total effectiveness and which can\nbe simply related to the stroke volume of the pump and to the unassisted\naortic pulse (Jones et al, 1968). This cycle analysis of the arterio-arterial pump\nis based on the windkessel theory of aortic impedance. Figure 5 illustrates\nthe essential idea of the cycle analysis. Here the pump injects its stroke\n\nEFFECTIVENESS OF PU\n\nQ=Qb(l-e-ATz)\n\n: Analysis of arterio-arterial pump.\n\n1008\n\nROBERT T. JONES\n\nvolume into the aorta which distends as a windkessel. The pressure increment\nso produced then decays exponentially as the volume flows out through the\nperipheral resistances. All of the added volume would ultimately find its way\ninto the periphery if enough time were available. However, the pump must\nwithdraw volume and lower the pressure in the aorta prior to the next heart\nbeat. It must therefore withdraw a portion of the blood previously injected,\nnamely the fraction\n\n,\n\nwhere Iz = I/RC. R is the peripheral resistance and C the aortic compliance\nor capacitance. Q, is the stroke volume of the pump and td is the diastolic\ninterval. The complete analysis, which entails the assumption that operation\nof the pump does not change systolic or diastolic intervals, leads to the formula\n\nThe quantity (1 - e-lrd) may be conveniently replaced by the quantity\n(Pi PJP, where PI and Pz are systolic and diastolic pressures with the\nunaided heart. In this form it is evident that the operation of such valveless\npumps depends on the pulsatile character of the aortic pressure. In order\nto obtain an upper bound for the effectiveness, it has been assumed that\n,\nthe pump displaces its volume Q instantaneously. Other variations of the\n,\nstroke Q as a function of the time will require a convolution of Q, with\nthe decay factor e-\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe use of the windkessel theory for aortic impedance corresponds to an\nassumption that the arterio-arterial pump will be equally effective at any\nposition along the aorta. Experiments with animals and with our artificial\ncirculation model tend to support this assumption provided the timing of the\npump cycle is adjusted to account for the delay in wave propagation.\nFigure 6 shows the result of an experiment made in the circulation model\nto check this assumption. Here the pumping effect of an intra-aortic balloon\nplaced in the descending thoracic aorta is compared with the effect of an\nauxiliary ventricle placed near the heart. In each case the same stroke volume\nwas used, but the timing of the balloon was advanced slightly. The curves on\nthe left of the chart recordings show the rather large aortic pressure produced\nby the pump during diastole. Near the center of each diagram the chart speed\nwas reduced, compressing the pulses. The rise in left ventricular pressure when\nthe pumps were turned off is clearly evident here and is approximately the\nsame for the balloon and the AV. During the compressed portions of the records an integrating circuit was switched on to record mean aortic pressures.\nThe mean pressures are an indication of the flow, and it will be noted that each\n\n1009\n\nFLUID DYNAMICS\n\nOF HEART ASSIST DEVICES\n\nPUMP ON\n\nt\n\nf\n\nPUMP OFF\n\nI\n\nLEFT VENTRICULAR PRESSURE\n\nPROXIMAL AORTIC PRESSURE\n\nDISTAL AORTIC PRESSURE\n\nLEFT VENTRICULAR PRESSURE\n\n-M\nPROXIMAL AORTIC PRESSURE\n\nDISTAL AORTIC PRESSLJRF\n\nFig. 6: Comparativeeffects of balloon pump and a\n-\n\nventricle.\n\npump increased the cardiac output by the same amount. In spite of the obstruction presented by the balloon in the aorta, the distal mean pressure is\nvery effectively increased.\nThe action of the arterio-arterial pump will evidently depend not only\non the source impedance of the heart, but also on the complex impedance\npresented by the aortic system. The impedance of the aorta is, of course,\ncomplicated by the phenomenon of pulse wave propagation. (McDonald,\n1960; Young, 1808, 1809; Womersley; 1956 Anliker and Maxwell, 1966).\nThe elastic tube, except for reflections, presents a characteristic resistive\nimpedance. With an injection velocity u the pressure developed is\ndp = guc\n\n1010\n\nROBERT T. JONES\n\nwhere c is the wave propagation velocity of the order of 500-1000 cmlsec.\nThe flow quantity will be uA where A is the cross-sectional area of the artery.\nThe characteristic impedance is then\n\nFor a wave speed of 600 cm/sec and an area A of 4 sq cm, we obtain\n(10)\n\n2, = 150 (cgs)\n\nEstimates of the capillary resistance associated with the various outlets may\nbe made from data on mean pressures and flow to various organs given in\nphysiology textbooks. Values of peripheral resistance vary over a wide range,\nespecially in pathologic conditions such as shock. However, it is significant\nthat the values are an order of magnitude greater than either the pulse\nimpedance or the frictional resistance of the aorta. Hence, we may suppose\nthat the pulse wave will be strongly reflected by large resistances which are:\nrather closely coupled through the main branching arteries. Furthermore,\nsince the time for a pulse wave to traverse the length of the aorta is short\ncompared with the duration of the heart beat one can expect the pressure and\nflow to be dominated by multiple reflections from the periphery during a\nsingle heart beat.\nThe foregoing characteristics of the aortic system lead us to what might be\ntermed a \xe2\x80\x9cslender windkessel\xe2\x80\x9d theory of aortic impedance. Clearly, if an\nelastic tube of finite length is inflated sufficiently slowly it will behave simply\nas a compliance. With more rapid inflation waves and their reflections from\n)\nthe ends will become prominent (Fig. 7. The important parameter here is\nthe characteristictime for reflection along the length of the tube, &/e,\ncompared\nwith the time scale of the inflation process. By expanding the wave reflection\nformulas in ascending powers of &/e,one obtains, first of all, the result of the\nwindkessel theory followed by a succession of terms which correct the windkessel theory for the finite length of the aorta (Jones, 1969). Curiously, the\nfirst correction does not involve the length of the windkessel at all but merely\ntakes account of the fact that the windkessel is an elastic tube. By considering\none of the two families of characteristics, there is obtained\n\nThus the first correcting term is simply 1/2 the characteristic pressure, puc.\nFigure 7 illustrates the process of inflation of an elastic tube for the case of a\nstepwise inflow velocity u(t) and shows the nature of the correction. Applying\nthis calculation to the aorta, one should take account of outflow at the reflection sites. Such outflow leads to progressive diminution of the reflected\n\n1011\n\nFLUID DYNAMICS OF HEART ASSIST DEVICES\nP\n\nTIME\n\nFig. 7: Inflation of an elongated windkessel.\n\npulses by a fixed fraction (reflection coefficient K ) and thence to an exponential\ndecay of aortic pressure. The windkessel theory (Pwk)shows this behavior\nby a convolution of the inflow pulse with the factor e-". However, since it\ndepends on the integral curve of the inflow pulse, Pwk shows too slow an\ninitial rise of pressure. This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 8.\nA method of arterio-arterial pumping not illustrated in Fig. 1 consists\nof withdrawing blood directly through cannulae inserted in the femoral\narteries and reinjecting the same blood during diastole. While the effect of\ndistance from the heart is rather small in the case of the balloon or the\nabdominal ventricle, such effects will certainly be larger here. In particular,\nthe taper of the artery will be significant since the femoral vessels may be only\n6 mm in diameter while the aorta near the heart is approximately 20-25 mm.\nThe pulse wave phenomenon in a tapered elastic tube leads, in the case of\nconstant wave speed, to an equation similar in form to that employed in the\nanalysis of acoustic horns. A treatment of the exponentially tapered tube has\n\n1012\n\nROBERT T. JONES\n\nSuperpition of reflected waves\nin proximal ond distal awta\n\nF g 8: Superposition of reflected waves i proximal and distal aorta.\ni.\nn\n\nbeen given (Evans, 1960). A transformation which yields a one-parameter\nfamily of solutions in which the wave speed and the tube diameter vary\ntogether is described by McMahon et a1 (1969).\nPerhaps the simplest treatment is that employing the spherical wave\nequation as suggested by Thomas Young (1808, 1809) for a straight conical\ntaper. Here the velocity potential will have the well-known form\n\nwhere R is the distance from the virtual apex of the aorta. Figure 9 shows a\ncalculation on this basis which illustrates the transformation between pressure\nand flow effected by a conically tapered elastic tube. Here we have assumed\nthat a quantity A Q = 10 cc is withdrawn from the narrow (6 mm) end of the\nconical tube, following the pressure and velocity variations shown. At the\nupper, wider end of the tube the pressure pulse is much reduced, although\nthe flow quantity temporarily withdrawn has increased to 40 cc.\nPulsatile pumping by direct withdrawal and injection through a small\nartery must evidently be restricted to certain levels of pressure and velocity\nin order to avoid blood damage. The flow velocity is in any case limited to\nvalues less than the pulse wave velocity. In the balloon pump the fluid withdrawn can be a light gas such as helium, enabling greater volumes to be\n\n1013\n\nFLUID DYNAMICS OF HEART ASSIST DEVICES\n\nI\n300\n\nAQ.40 CC\n\n200\n\nCMISEC\n\nI oc\n\nPRESSURE, mm Hg\n24mm\n\nG/\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nSPEED C = 500\n\ng\nc\n\nI\n\ni\n\nAQ = 1 CC\n0\n\n:\n\nI\n6 mm\n\nrVELOCiTY\n\n0\n\nTIME, SECONDS\nFig. 9: Transmission of pulse i tapered artery.\nn\n\npumped.

The blood trapped between the ends of the balloon\nis, of course, not effective in the pumping cycle, and the aorta in this region\nmay be subjected to high pressures of the order of the drive pressure.\nOne method we have found successful in limiting this phenomenon is to\ndivide the balloon along its length into a number of compartments, inflating\nthe compartments selectively through orifices of different size.
