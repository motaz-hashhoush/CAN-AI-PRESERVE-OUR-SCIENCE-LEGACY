b'B\n\nelow is HAZBOT 111, a prototype teleoperated\nmobile robot designed for response to emergencies involving hazardous materials. Developed by\nJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), HAZBOT I11 is\npart of an emergency response system that\nalso includes an Operator Control Station\n(OCS); both elements have independent\ncomputer systems that\ncommunicate with each\nother via a tether.\nThe system is a\nproduct of a NASAfunded Emergency\nResponse Robotics\nProject, initiated by NASA a s a\nfive-year effort to apply and transfer\n,r\nJ\nto industry JPL\'s extensive robotic\nknow-how, and to advance robotics technology for HAZMAT, nuclear, mining, law enforcement and\nother applications.\n\nTeleoperated robots can contribute significantly to\nreducing human injury levels by performing hazardous\ntasks that would otherwise be handled by humans. An\nexample is shown below, where HAZBOT Ill is sensing\nleaks from a cyl~nder anhydrous ammonia under the\nof\nsupervision of Jerry Collins of the JPL Fire\nDepartmenVHAZMAT Team (in actual use, Collins would\noperate the robot from a safe location away from the incident site).\nJPL did not develop HAZBOT 111 from scratch, but\nused a s a developmental departure point a commercially\navailable ANDROS Mark V-A robot manufactured by\nREMOTEC", Inc., Oak Ridge, Tennessee, a segment of\nWestinghouse Electronic Systems Group. In the course of\ndeveloping the emergency response system, JPL extensively redesigned its ANDROS and added features based\non feedback from JPL Fire Department personnel who\ntested the vehicle.\n\nA major feature added was a new control panel,\nshown above being operated by Rick Welch, task manager of the Emergency Response Robotics Project. The original ANDROS control panel consisted of a simple bank of\ntoggle switches, one to control each action of the robot,\nwhich made complex manipulation tasks difficult and\ntedious. The new, simplified control panel (shown at\nright above its predecessor) uses spring-loaded potentiometers placed on a side-view graphic of the robot. If a\npotentiometer is rotated clockwise, the corresponding\njoint moves In that direct~on; potentiometers also prothe\nvide velocity control for the different robot actions.\nThe JPL project achieved its first technology transfer\nto lnduslry when REMOTEC reported to JPL that i t was\nadopting some of the design concepts developed for\nHAZBOT 111, in particular the control panel. Sammy L.\nJones, field projects manager for REMOTEC, reported to\nJPL that "We anticipate this design change will enhance\nour operator control station and make our ANDROS vehicle easier and safer to operate." REMOTEC and JPL are\nlooking at other technology developed in the Emergency\nResponse Robotics Project that could be transferred.\n\nHAZBOT 111 has exceptional mobility,\ncontributed by its tanklike track drive with\nspecial articulated front and rear sections,\nwhich allow the vehicle to climb stairs and\nmove over obstacles a s well a s negotiate\nrough terrain. On-board batteries give the\nvehicle enough power for missions longer\nthan three hours.\nA significant feature is the vehicle\'s\nunique design for safe operation within a\ncombustible atmosphere; it employs solid\nstate electronics and brushless DC\nmotors to bar electr~cal\narcing, and the\nchassis/manipulator design allows for positive pressurization of all areas containing\nelectronics and motors so combustible gases\ncannot enter.\nAmong other features are the sixdegree-of-freedom manipulator with a fivefoot reach and a 30-pound lift capability; a\n30-pound squeeze force parallel jaw gripper; two video cameras, one for general\nviewing and navigation, the other on the\narm\'s wrist for manipulation/grasping; a gas\nsensor built into the manipulator forearm;\ncustom tools for unlocking and opening doors; and a small\nwinch that serves a variety of mission functions.\n@REMOTEC1s a reglatered trademark of REMOTEC, Inc.\n\n,I\n\n'
