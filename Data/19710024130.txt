Field of the Invention\nThisinvention\nto\n\npower dividing\n\nparticularly to hi& power\ncapable of pro,,iding variable output power to an output waveguide in a fixed waveguide system.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nThere is a rcquiremeht in cenain applications operate a\nof power 20\ntransmitter at a\nlevel while reducing the\nradiated by an associated antenna. This reduction in.radiated\npower is desirable, forexample, when a transmitter is part ofa\nvehicular system such as a spacecraft and transmission is made\nreceiving station which may\nin\nproximity to a\nrelativelysmall 25\nbe overloaded by full power transmission\ndistances. In these and other applications. it is not desirable to\ntransreduce\nantenna radiating power by\nmilter output ]eve[, since such a procedure tends to &grade\nthe bandwidth and modulation characteristics of the transtransmitter power 30\nmitter,\nit is desirable to leave\nfixed and divide the supplied transmitter power between thc\nantenna and a dissipative load.\nhas\nTo achieve\nrcquircd power division function\nwhich arc connected\nbeen made of microwave power\nbetween\ntransmitter and an\nload to vary\n35\npower delivered to the associated antcnna.\nMany types of power dividers are known in the art. These\ndividers are generally of two types. A first type has a rectangular input and a rectangular output waveguide section con- 40\nnected by an intermediate circular waveguide section. Typically, either the input ot the output rectangular waveguide\nsection rotates relative to the other section to attenuate the\nenergy delivered to the output waveguide section connected\nto the antenna. This results, however, in the requirement that 45\na portion of the transmission system connected to the power\ndivider must be capable of rotating with either the input or\noutput waveguide section. This is not desirable since the complicated mechanical couplings required degrade overall\nsystem reliability.\n50\nTo overcome this disadvantage, attempts have been made\nto develop systems in which neither the input nor output terminal of the power divider is required to rotate. T O achieve\nthis, various complicated intermediately connected waveguide 55\nconfigurations interconnecting the input and Output Ports of\nthe power divider have been developed. The function of these\nintermediate configurations is to attempt to rotate the ckctric\nfield of the transmitted chergy to attenuate the power pusscd\nby the rectangular waveguide output section.\nOne known device utilizes a rectangular waveguide vertebra\nsection comprising a plurality of vertebra discs connected to\nthe input port. Each disc has a rectangular transmission Port\nwhich is rotatable so as to be seleCtivelY angUlarlY disposed\nrelative to all adjacent discs. The vertebra sections serve to \xe2\x80\x9c- 65\nskew\xe2\x80\x9d the electric vector of the transmitted waveform. This\nconfiguration, however, reSulU in OverlaPPing Projections\nbetween passageways o f djacent vertebra discs. The Pro&tions attenuate and distori the energy Of the Signal being\n70\nrotated as it passes through the vertebra section.\nand\n\nA mode change transducer ving a rectangular waveguide\ninput port transduces the received TE,, mode linearly\npolarized energy to TE,, mode energy. A following first\nquarter-wave plate transduces the lincarly polarized TE, ,\nmode energy to a TEII mode Circular polarization mode. A\nfollowing second quarter-wave plate rotatable with respect to\nthe first quarter-wavc plate transduces the circular polarized\nenergy t(J T ~ mode linearly P\xe2\x80\x9dlarizd energy wherein the\nI\nangle of polarization iri a function of the relative rotation angle\nbetween the nccond and first quarter-wave plate.\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99hc linearly pcilariacd energy thus obtained is applied to an\northomode trnnuduccr fixed relative to the input rectangular\nwaveguide. The power into each output port of the orthomode\ntransducer in a function of the polarization angle of the incident wave and is therefore controllablc by the rotary setting\nof the second quarter-wave plate.\nIt is, therefore. an object of this invention to provide a highpower microwave power divider which includes a minimum of\nrotatable sections between fixed waveguide input and output\nwctions.\nIt is another object of the present invention to provide a\nhigh-powcr microwave power divider capable Of providing a\nvsriable output which is varied by simply rotating an intermcdiate circular waveguide section while diverting excess\nload.\npower into a\nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide a\nfixed\nsystem microwave power\ndivider characterized in that a minimum of moveable components are required between the input and output terminals\nStill other objects. features and attendant advanlagex of thc\npresent invention will become apparent to those skilled in the\nart from a reading of the following detailed description of\nseveral embodiments constructed in accordance thcrewith\ntaken in conjunction with thc accompanying drawings and\nwherein:\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a microwave\npower divider constructed in accordance with the principles\nof the present invention;\nFIGS. 2A-D illustrate field modes present in various portions ofthe embodiment of FIG. 1; and\nFIG. 3 is a block diagram of a system utilizing the power divider of FIG. 1 wherein energy received from a transmitter\noutput may be attenuated for any adjustable level to an antenna while diverting the excess power into a dissipative load.\nDESCRIPTloN OF THE PREFERRED\n\nReferring now to FIG. 1, there is shown an\nmicrowave power dividcr constructed in accordance with the\nprinciples of the present invention. A rectangular waveguide\nInput section 10 is couplcd to a mode change section 11 via a\ncoupling flange 25 of any suitable type.\nInput waveguide 10 is adapted to receive linearly polarized\nenergy in the TE,, mode as illustrated by field mode diagram\n2A, FIG. 2. As is well-known, linearly polarized microwave\nenergy is represented by having an electric field vector along a\nfixed line. The TE,,, mode as used in this application refers to\nthe dominant mode of a rectangular waveguide. Although the\nspecific embodiment described utilizes a rectangular\nwaveguide input port the power divider could be\nwith\nother configured input ports such as elliptical ports wherein\nthe dominant propagation mode is similar to that in a rectangular waveguide section.\nMode change section 1 1 may be any known mode change\ntransducer which is adaoted to receive linearlv oolarized\nmicrowave energy in $he TE,, mode and transduce it to\nOEJECTS A N D SUM ARY OF THE INVENTION\nlinearly polarized microwave energy in the TE,, mode as illustratedby field mode diagram 2B:FIG. 2. The mode change\nIn accordance with the present invention, there is provided\nsection 11 is connected to a first quarter-wave plate 12 via a\na fixed rectangular wavelfiride system power divider of con75 connecting flange 26. The quarter-wave plate 12 is adapted in\nsiderably simpler design than that heretofore available.\n\n..\n\n3,588,75 1\n\n3\na well-known manner to convert the TE,,mode linearly\npolarized energy supplied by mode change section P 1 to TE,,\nmode circularly polarized energy as illustrated by field mode\ndiagram 2C, FIG 2. As is known. circular polarization is\nrepresented by a vector representxi2 the wave which has a 5\nconstant magnitude and rotates continuously about a point.\nA second quarter-wave plate 13 is rotatably connected\nbetween quarter-wave plate 12 and an output orthomode\ntransducer 14 via rotatable joints 20 and 21. Joints 20 and 21\nmay be of any suitable type well-known in the circular 0\nwaveguide art. The rotatable quarter-wave plate 13 converts\nthe TE,, circularly polarized energy provided by first quarterwave plate 1.2 to linearly polarized energy in a well-known\nmanner wherein the angle of polarization is a function of the\nrotated position of quarter-wave plate 13.The output for one\nposition of quarter-wave plate 13.The output for one position\nof quarter-wave plate 13 is illustrated by field mode diagram\n2D.\nFIG. 2.\nOrthomode transducer 84 receives the linearly polarized 20\noutput of second quarter-wave plate 13. Transducer 14 is\nshown with a pair of orehogonally disposed rectangular\nwaveguide ports 15 and 16. As is well-known in the art, the\noutput energy will be distributed between output ports 15 and\n16 in accordance with the angular orientation of the linearly 25\npolarized input to orthomode transducer 14.\nOPERATION\nAssume that 0" is the direction of polarization at input port\n10 as shown in FIG. 2A. The mode change section 11 and the\nfirst quarter-wave plate 12 transduce the linearly polarized\ninput waveform to a TE,, circular polarization mode, as previously described. The second quarter-wave plate 13 transduces\nthe circularly polarized energy to linearly polarized energy\nwhich is rotatable through 360" in accordance with the rotated\nposition of quarter-wave plate 13.\nMode FIG. 2D illustrates a specific example wherein the\nlinear polarized output from quarter-wave plate 13 is disposed\nat an angle of 45" relative to the 0" reference mode FIG. 2A.\nThe amount of power distributed to loads connected respectively to output ports 15 and 16 is therefore a function of the\nangular position of the second quarter-wave plate 13. The\npower delivered to output ports I\xc2\xa7 and 16 may be determined\nfrom the equations\nP , B = P , ~ ~ ~ ,e\nCOS*\n(1)\nSin48\nt2)\nwhere B is the angular orientation of the quarter-wave plate 13\nwith respect to quarter-wave plate 12. The attenuation from\ninput port 10 to output port 16 may be given as:\nA,d&Og COS* 0\n(3)\nA,,jpIOg COS 8\n(4)\nSince attenuation is clearly a function only of the angular\nposition of quarter-wave plate 13, the proportion of input\npower delivered to output ports 15 and 16 respectively is\ncompletely determined by controlling the rotated position of\nquarter-wave plate 13.\nReferring now to FIG.3,there is shown a block diagram of a\nmicrowave transmission system constructed in accordance\nwith the principles of the present invention. As shown in FIG.\n3, a microwave transmitter 30 is connected to an antenna 50\nvia microwave power divider 40. Power divider 40 in accordance with this invention receives linearly polarized\nmicrowave energy at input port 10 and is adapted as abovedescribed to divide the output energy in accordance with any\ndesired output ratio between output ports 15 and 16.\nOutput port 16 provides the energy supply to antenna 50.\nOutput port 15 is connected to a high-power dissipative load\n41. The embodiment of FIG. 3 is adapted to allow the full\ntransmitter output to be supplied to the antenna or to allow\nany fractional urouortion of the transmitter outuut uower to\nbe-dissipated i i t i e high-power load. The high ioad\'termination 41 is selected so that it may dissipate the full power output cable of being supplied by divider 40. Such a dissipative\ncharacteristic for load 1 allows the power supplied to antenna 50 to be varied over any desired amount without degrading\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nso\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\nthe bandwidth modulation or other characteristics of the\ntransmitter, since the impedance as seen by the transmitter 3\nnever varies. This is so since all power supplied by the transmitter is dissipated by the antenna-dissipative load combination without any power being reflected back to the transminer.\nWe claim:\n1.
