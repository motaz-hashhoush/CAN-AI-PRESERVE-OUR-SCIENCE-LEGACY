Virtually all hydrologic models, with only a few exceptions, were designed to interface with conventional point data. These models must be modified or new ones developed to be compatible with remote sensing capabilities (areal coverage, high spatial resolution, repetitiveness, etc.). A comprehensive program of development and testing of these models at various application scales ranging from flash flood modeling and small tributary streams to continental size general circulation models must be carried out.", "title": "Global Hydrologic Cycle", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T00:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840022365, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rango, A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "2a783e24880143b5a944abff58daa34c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-09-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19840022365, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840022365, "id": "7585d753f7534b94b1554826d5086601", "publicationName": "Earth Observing System.
