At sufficient field strengths and concentrations, the dipolar particles rapidly aggregate to form long chains. Subsequent lateral cross-linking of the dipolar chains is responsible for a rapid liquid-to-solid-like rheological transition. The unique, magnetically-activated rheological properties of MR suspensions make them ideal for interfacing mechanical systems to electronic controls. Additionally, the ability to experimentally probe colloidal suspensions interacting through tunable anisotropic potentials is of fundamental interest. Our current experimental work has focused on understanding the fluctuations of dipolar chains. It has been proposed by Halsey and Toor (HT) that the strong Landau-Peierls thermal fluctuations of dipolar chains could be responsible for long-range attractions between chains. Such interactions will govern the long-time relaxation of MR suspensions. We have synthesized monodisperse neutrally buoyant MR suspensions by density matching stabilized ferrofluid emulsion droplets with D2O. This allows us to probe the dynamics of the dipolar chains using light scattering without gravitational, interfacial, and polydispersity effects to resolve the short-wavelength dynamics of the dipolar chains. We used diffusing wave spectroscopy to measure these dynamics. The particle displacements at short times that show an independence to the field strength, but at long times exhibit a constrained, sub-diffusive motion that slows as the dipole strength is increased. The experiments are in good qualitative agreement with Brownian dynamics simulations of dipolar chains. Although there have been several important and detailed studies of the structure and interactions in MR suspensions, there has not been conclusive evidence that supports or contradicts the HT model prediction that long-range interactions exist between fluctuating chains of dipolar particles. Resolving this issue would contribute greatly to the understanding of these interesting and important materials. We have begun to test the predictions of the HT model by both examining the dynamics of individual chains and by measuring the forces between dipolar chains directly to accurately and quantitatively assess the interactions that they experience. To do so, we employ optical trapping techniques and video-microscopy to manipulate and observe our samples on the microscopic level. With these techniques, it is possible to observe chains that are fluctuating freely in three-dimensions, independent of interfacial effects. More importantly, we are able to controllably observe the interactions of two chains at various separations to measure the force-distance profile. The techniques also allow us to study the mechanical properties of individual chains and chain clusters. Our work to this point has focused on reversibly-formed dipolar chains due to field induced dipoles where the combination of this chaining, the dipolar forces, and the hydrodynamic interactions that dictate the rheology of the suspensions. One can envision, however, many situations where optical, electronic, or rheological behavior may be optimized with magneto-responsive anisotropic particles. Chains of polarizable particles may have the best properties as they can coil and flex in the absence of a field and stiffen and orient when a field is applied. We have recently demonstrated a synthesis of stable, permanent paramagnetic chains by both covalently and physically linking paramagnetic colloidal particles. The method employed allows us to create monodisperse chains of controlled length. We observed the stability, field-alignment, and rigidity of this new class of materials. The chains may exhibit unique rheological properties in an applied magnetic field over isotropic suspensions of paramagnetic particles. They are also useful rheological models as bead-spring systems. These chains form the basis for our current experiments with optical traps.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010004288, "id": "255bc436dc8c47f28f69a4ddd2553062", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the Fourth Microgravity Fluid Physics and Transport Phenomena Conference", "publicationDate": "1999-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20010004264, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings of the Fourth Microgravity Fluid Physics and Transport Phenomena Conference", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20010004288.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20010004288/downloads/20010004288.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20010004288/downloads/20010004288.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20010004288/downloads/20010004288.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
