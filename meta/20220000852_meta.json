High-power solar electric propulsion systems employed in \u201cslow-push\u201d techniques may be the best way to deflect asteroids in this size range if deflection is warranted. The relative performance of three slow-push techniques\u2014gravity tractor (GT), enhanced gravity tractor (EGT), and ion beam deflection (IBD)\u2014are compared, assuming solar electric propulsion vehicles derived from NASA\u2019s Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission concept vehicle. Both the enhanced gravity tractor and ion beam deflection concepts are shown to be significantly better than the standard gravity tractor concept. The Hall-thruster based enhanced gravity tractor systems and ion beam deflection systems (based on the use of high-power gridded ion thrusters) are shown to provide comparable performance, i.e., similar deflection times and propellant required. Enhanced gravity tractor systems require the acquisition of material from the surface of the hazardous object in order to achieve the required \u201cenhancement\u201d of the gravitational coupling force. This makes EGT systems sensitive to the rotational state and surface properties of the unknown object, and potentially severely limits its applicability. Ion beam deflection is completely independent of the characteristics of the threat object. In fact, it is the only asteroid deflection technique, slow-push or otherwise, that can make this claim, thus potentially greatly increasing its applicability relative to other deflection techniques. Finally, high-power IBD systems are shown to be capable of deflecting the fictitious asteroid 2015 PDC used in the hypothetical asteroid impact exercise conducted at the 2015 Planetary Defense Conference.", "title": "Advanced Solar Electric Propulsion for Planetary Defense", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000852, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brophy, John"}}, "id": "78d43c17bd9443a98dfb1149525511ed"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:44:35.3627830+00:00", "id": 20220000852, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/52343", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20220000852, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2015", "id": "95a8ebf7bc694e29a0e53bbd293d9654", "publicationDate": "2015-07-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
