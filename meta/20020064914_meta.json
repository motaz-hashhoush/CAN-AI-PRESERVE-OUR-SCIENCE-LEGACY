Jets of hot air at the top and bottom of the oven are focused on the food, rather than heating the oven cavity as in a traditional thermal oven. By heating the food directly, foods cook faster and more consistently, retaining flavor and texture. Several companies have licensed this technology, including KRh Thermal Systems, which has introduced a line of Hot Choice vending machines. Enersyst has also licensed the first home application to Thermador.", "title": "Eating on Demand", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020064914, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020064914, "isbn": "0-16-049737-X", "id": "2d974444bbb84d43a5bb84a1bdc33bec", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1998", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020064914.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020064914/downloads/20020064914.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020064914/downloads/20020064914.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020064914/downloads/20020064914.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
