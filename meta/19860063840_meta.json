The experiments show that the favorable effect of ground proximity in hover disappears rapidly with small increases in advance ratio. Two flow regimes occur, a recirculation of the rotor wake is present at the low end of the advance ratio range investigated and a ground vortex is formed as advance ratio increases, causing irregular changes in the hub moments with advance ratio. Experimental results also show that translational acceleration has a significant effect on the ground effect of a lifting rotor. Hot wire measurements of the flow field under the ratio in ground effect are also presented. The experimental data are analyzed to determine effective values of the inflow in ground effect.", "title": "Ground effect aerodynamics", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T21:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860063840, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Curtiss, H.
