It is pointed out that the use of the Space Shuttle will reduce the cost of placing a satellite in orbit from more than half to less than a quarter of the total cost of design, construction, and launch. Attention is given to studies of a personal communications system which involves direct broadcast from a 'wrist watch radio' to a high-capacity, multibeam satellite for retransmission to ground communications centrals.", "title": "Public service satellites", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T21:45:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19770045004, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fletcher, J.
