These remote observations provide a rigorous validation of whole disk Earth model simulations used to better understand remotely detectable extrasolar planet characteristics. We have used these data to\nupgrade, correct, and validate the NASA Astrobiology Institute\xe2\x80\x99s Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional line-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model (Tinetti et al.,\n2006a,b). This comprehensive model now includes specular re\xef\xac\x82ectance from the ocean and\nexplicitly includes atmospheric e\xef\xac\x80ects such as Rayleigh scattering, gas absorption, and temperature structure. We have used this model to generate spatially and temporally resolved\nsynthetic spectra and images of Earth for the dates of EPOXI observation. Model parameters were varied to yield an optimum \xef\xac\x81t to the data. We found that a minimum spatial\nresolution of \xe2\x88\xbc100 pixels on the visible disk, and four categories of water clouds, which\nwere de\xef\xac\x81ned using observed cloud positions and optical thicknesses, were needed to yield\nacceptable \xef\xac\x81ts. The validated model provides a simultaneous \xef\xac\x81t to the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s lightcurve,\nabsolute brightness, and spectral data, with a root-mean-square error of typically less than\n3% for the multiwavelength lightcurves, and residuals of \xe2\x88\xbc10% for the absolute brightness\nthroughout the visible and NIR spectral range. We extend our validation into the midinfrared by comparing the model to high spectral resolution observations of Earth from\nthe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, obtaining a \xef\xac\x81t with residuals of \xe2\x88\xbc7%, and brightness\ntemperature errors of less than 1K in the atmospheric window. For the purpose of understanding the observable characteristics of the distant Earth at arbitrary viewing geometry\nand observing cadence, our validated forward model can be used to simulate Earth\xe2\x80\x99s time\ndependent brightness and spectral properties for wavelengths from the far ultraviolet to the\nfar infrared.\n\n1\n\nKeywords: ASTROBIOLOGY; EXTRASOLAR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS;\nHABITABILITY; PLANETARY SCIENCE; RADIATIVE TRANSFER\n\n2\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfter an initial decade dominated by the discovery of Jupiter-mass planets, the next\nfrontier of exoplanet research will be the detection and characterization of terrestrialmass planets. Within the next few years, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Kepler spacecraft will make the \xef\xac\x81rst\ncomprehensive estimates of the prevalence and nature of extrasolar terrestrial planets\n(Borucki et al., 2003), while searching for Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones\nof their parent stars (Basri et al., 2005). In the coming decades more ambitious\nplanet detection and characterization missions for habitable Earth-mass planets are\nplanned, such as NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Terrestrial Planet Finder mission (Beichman et al., 1999).\nThese missions will be designed to detect and characterize nearby habitable planets,\nwith the capability to obtain direct imaging, and photometric and spectroscopic data\nfor extrasolar terrestrial planets\nThe observational challenges inherent in characterizing a terrestrial exoplanet are\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cant, and carefully considered trade o\xef\xac\x80s must be made to maximize the science return. Even with the most ambitious telescopes planned, terrestrial exoplanets\nwill remain faint, spatially unresolved point sources. The principal challenge is to\ndetermine the minimum and optimum sets of observational parameters that can best\ncharacterize the environment of an unresolved planet, which may be spatially inhomogeneous, cloud covered, and temporally variable. For example, the combination\nof temporal resolution and multi-wavelength photometry could disentangle phase or\nrotation dependent di\xef\xac\x80erences in surface properties from variable cloud cover. The\nresulting maps could discriminate between large scale surface inhomogeneities such\nas continents and oceans (Pall\xc2\xb4 et al., 2008; Cowan et al., 2009; Kawahara and Fue\njii, 2010; Fujii et al., 2011). Disk integrated spectroscopy can potentially determine\nglobally averaged atmospheric and surface composition to verify habitability and to\n\n3\n\nsearch for global evidence of life in the planetary environment (Seager et al., 2005;\nMonta\xcb\x9c\xc2\xb4s-Rodr\xc2\xb4\nne\n\xc4\xb1guez et al., 2006; Meadows, 2006).\nNew tools are needed to obtain quantitative information about the environments\nof terrestrial planets that can only be studied as unresolved point sources. A typical\napproach to understanding a world from disk-integrated observations consists of a\n\xe2\x80\x9cforward model\xe2\x80\x9d, an \xe2\x80\x9cinstrument model\xe2\x80\x9d, and an \xe2\x80\x9cinverse model.\xe2\x80\x9d The forward model\nis typically a radiative transfer model designed to generate a synthetic spectrum, given\nan assumed surface-atmospheric state and viewing geometry. The instrument model\nsimulates the spectral and spatial resolution and other properties of the observing\nsystem. The inverse model adjusts surface or atmospheric state to yield a better\n\xef\xac\x81t to the observations. Given a candidate observing system design, re\xef\xac\x81nements in\nboth forward models and inverse methods are needed to fully exploit the information\ncontent of disk-integrated observations of terrestrial planets. Most existing forward\nmodels are designed to analyze soundings taken with adequate spatial resolution to\nyield spatially homogeneous sounding footprints. Forward models designed for surface\nor \xe2\x80\x9cclear sky\xe2\x80\x9d remote sensing applications rarely perform well with cloudy soundings.\nThose designed for land remote sensing observations rarely simulate the re\xef\xac\x82ection\nfrom the ocean surface. In short, few if any forward models have been designed to\nyield accurate observations over the full range of solar illumination angles, observation\nangles, or surface and atmospheric properties present in a single, integrated, full disk\nobservation of an extrasolar planet. Here, we describe a forward model designed\nspeci\xef\xac\x81cally to simulate disk-integrated observations of Earth, which can serve as a\ntheoretical \xe2\x80\x9claboratory\xe2\x80\x9d for the accurate simulation of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s appearance at arbitrary\nviewing geometries and phases. These simulations can be used to explore and identify\nthe best conditions under which to search for planetary characteristics of habitability\nand life, such as the presence of an ocean or a photosynthetic biosphere, and can\n4\n\nalso be used to generate test data to challenge proposed observational and retrieval\ntechniques for extrasolar planet characterization.\nRemote sensing observations provide a glimpse of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s appearance from space.\nOur planet is well studied by an armada of satellites, covering several wavelength regions from the ultraviolet through microwave with high temporal and spatial sampling\nof Earth\xe2\x80\x99s photometry and spectroscopy (Hearty et al., 2009). However, these data\nsets are often not ideal for studying Earth as an astronomical target because of the\nsheer data volume that must be manipulated to produce a global, or disk-integrated,\nview, and because most satellites are in Sun-synchronous low Earth orbits, which\nview the Earth over a limited range of viewing geometries and times of day. By comparison, spatially and/or spectrally resolved forward models can readily simulate the\nfull disk Earth from observing geometries, solar illuminations, and wavelengths that\nmay not be accessible to existing Earth observing satellites.\nExisting Earth models for exoplanet characterization studies are largely dominated\nby computationally inexpensive specular re\xef\xac\x82ectance models (e.g., Ford et al., 2001;\nWilliams and Gaidos, 2008). These models do not include atmospheric absorption\nand scattering, and are most e\xef\xac\x80ective at visible light wavelengths, where they can be\nused to model the photometric variability of the rotating Earth, and to determine the\ndetectability as a function of phase of specular re\xef\xac\x82ection or \xe2\x80\x9cglint\xe2\x80\x9d from the ocean surface. Similar models (Pall\xc2\xb4 et al., 2003; Oakley and Cash, 2009) utilize bi-directional\ne\nre\xef\xac\x82ectance functions that are designed to match data which have been measured by\nEarth observing satellites (e.g., Manalo-Smith et al., 1998). Spectral Earth models that include absorption by some atmospheric species and which simulate Earth\nspectra using weighted averages of independent, one-dimensional component spectra\nrepresenting cloudy and clear sky scenes have also been developed (Woolf et al., 2002;\nTurnbull et al., 2006; Stam, 2008). Monta\xcb\x9c\xc2\xb4s-Rodr\xc2\xb4\nne\n\xc4\xb1guez et al. (2006) modeled Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\n5\n\nspectrum using a line-by-line radiative transfer model which was limited to simulating\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s environment in one dimension, using globally averaged atmospheric, surface,\nand cloud properties. In their model, standard atmospheric composition and temperature pro\xef\xac\x81les were assumed and Earth\xe2\x80\x99s spectrum was obtained by averaging di\xef\xac\x80erent\ncomponent spectra based on data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project. The primary limitation associated with one-dimensional approaches to\nmodeling Earth\xe2\x80\x99s disk integrated spectrum is that these models do not capture latitudinal and longitudinal variations in the composition and temperature of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\natmosphere, and thus cannot be used to quantify the impact of spatial variations in\ntemperature and composition on the information content of simulated observations.\nThe EPOXI mission, a reuse of the Deep Impact \xef\xac\x82yby spacecraft, has recently\nprovided a very rigorous data set for validating full disk forward models of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nspectrum prior to predictive use. The EPOXI observations of the distant Earth\n(Livengood et al., 2011) provide several days of time resolved, multi-wavelength visible photometry and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s disk through a full\n24-hour rotation period. Previously, disk integrated spectra and photometry of Earth\nhad been obtained from limited, often single, measurements of Earthshine and from\nplanetary spacecraft. Earthshine is re\xef\xac\x82ected light from Earth illuminating the night\nside of the Moon (Goode et al., 2001; Arnold et al., 2002; Woolf et al., 2002; Turnbull\net al., 2006; Monta\xcb\x9c\xc2\xb4s-Rodr\xc2\xb4\nne\n\xc4\xb1guez et al., 2006), and it is constrained by viewing geometry to restricted phases and temporal durations. Snapshot or \xef\xac\x82yby observations of\nthe Earth have also been obtained from spacecraft en route to other planets, for example from the Galileo spacecraft (Sagan et al., 1993) or from Mars Global Surveyor\n(Christensen and Pearl, 1997).\nUsing the new EPOXI data set, we validate and present the most comprehensive\nspectral Earth model to date for the prediction of the photometric and spectroscopic\n6\n\ncharacteristics of Earthlike exoplanets. This model is a forward model, which is used\nto simulate the appearance of Earth to an observer, for the purpose of exploring the\ndetectability of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s planetary characteristics as a function of observational geometry and time. Forward models, such as the model presented in this work, are distinct\nfrom, but complementary to, retrieval models designed to retrieve atmospheric characteristics from observations of extrasolar planets (e.g., Madhusudhan and Seager,\n2009). In particular, it is important that forward models be as realistic as possible so\nthat they accurately represent the appearance of planet, and, as a result, do not bias\nthe observed planetary properties inferred when using the model as a predictive tool.\nA previous, more limited version of this model, published in Tinetti et al. (2006a,b),\nhas been corrected, and signi\xef\xac\x81cantly updated and improved to allow accurate predictions of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s time dependent photometric and spectroscopic brightness, on hourly\nto yearly timescales, through realistic modeling of the radiative e\xef\xac\x80ects of a surface\nocean, atmosphere, and clouds. The previous model allowed for an arbitrary scaling\nof its input cloud coverage data, and it also used the optical thickness of clouds as\nfree parameters. By tuning the previous model, snapshot observations of Earth could\nbe reproduced and the model could then be used to explore certain characteristics of\nEarth, such as how the planet\xe2\x80\x99s brightness changes with phase. Time resolved data\nwere not used for validation.\nIn the process of validating the model against the time and phase resolved EPOXI\nobservations, we have signi\xef\xac\x81cantly upgraded the model to self-consistently utilize\nsatellite derived cloud data. Cloud coverage is now taken from observations by Earth\nobserving satellites and is no longer scaled in order to reproduce observations. The\noptical thickness of clouds in our new model is also provided by Earth observing\nsatellites, rather than being tunable free parameters. We have also corrected an error\nin the model presented in Tinetti et al. (2006a,b) which e\xef\xac\x80ectively confused forward\n7\n\nscattering with backward scattering, thus causing the model to produce unphysical\nsimulated observations of Earth. Our Earth model is based on a fully multiplescattering, line-by-line radiative transfer model, SMART (Meadows and Crisp, 1996;\nCrisp, 1997), which is at the core of the exoplanet simulations generated by the\nNASA Astrobiology Institute\xe2\x80\x99s Virtual Planetary Laboratory (VPL). The new, selfconsistent treatment of clouds in our model has allowed us to match the EPOXI\nEarth observations, which span almost three months in time and a variety of phases,\nwithout tuning from one dataset to the next (for validation against Earthshine data\nover a wider range of phases, see Robinson et al. (2010)). Our validated model is\ncapable of simulating Earth\xe2\x80\x99s wavelength dependent temporal variability and absolute\nbrightness, for any given viewing geometry and phase, over wavelengths from the\nultraviolet to the far infrared (IR).\n\n3\n\nDescription of EPOXI Earth Observations\n\nThe EPOXI Earth data sets used for our model validation were acquired with the\nHigh Resolution Instrument (HRI) on board the Deep Impact \xef\xac\x82yby spacecraft, and\nare described in (Livengood et al., 2011). The HRI is a 0.3m f /35 telescope with nine\nsquare-bandpass \xef\xac\x81lters and a NIR spectrometer (Hampton et al., 2005). Seven \xef\xac\x81lters\nare \xe2\x88\xbc 100 nm wide and are centered at 350, 450, 550, 650, 750, 850 and 950 nm,\nsegmenting the visual spectral range. The NIR spectrometer covers the wavelength\nrange from 1.05-4.5 \xc2\xb5m with a maximum resolution (R = \xce\xbb/\xe2\x88\x86\xce\xbb) of 750 at the shortest\nwavelengths, a minimum resolution of 200 at about 2.6 \xc2\xb5m and a resolution of 350\nat the longest wavelengths (Klaasen et al., 2008).\nEarth was observed with the HRI in three separate 24-hour periods: 2008-Mar-18\n18:18 UT - 2008-Mar-19 18:18 UT, 2008-May-28 20:05 UT - 2008-May-29 20:05 UT,\n8\n\nand 2008-Jun-4 16:57 UT - 2008-Jun-5 16:57 UT. The star-planet-telescope angle\n(phase angle) for the three sets of observations were 57.7\xe2\x97\xa6 , 75.1\xe2\x97\xa6 , and 76.6\xe2\x97\xa6, respectively. NIR spectra of Earth were taken every two hours (30\xe2\x97\xa6 rotation) a total of\n13 times, to cover a full rotation of Earth from the viewpoint of the spacecraft. The\nNIR spectrometer slit was oriented perpendicular to the terminator, due to spacecraft\nconstraints. To avoid saturation and to obtain globally averaged spectra, rapid scans\nwere made alternating between south to north and north to south across Earth to\nlimit the amount of time any part of Earth was within the slit of the spectrometer.\nPhotometry in the 450, 550, 650 and 850 nm \xef\xac\x81lters was taken every \xef\xac\x81fteen minutes\n(\xe2\x88\xbc 4\xe2\x97\xa6 rotation) and every hour (15\xe2\x97\xa6 rotation) for the 350, 750 and 950 nm \xef\xac\x81lters.\nNote that a subset of the March and June data sets were published by Cowan et al.\n(2009), who treated the data in a retrieval sense and performed a principal component\nanalysis of the lightcurves to map the latitudinally averaged distribution of land and\nocean on Earth.\n\n4\n\nDescription of Model\n\nThe comprehensive Earth model presented in this paper uses input data from Earth\nobserving satellites and a radiative transfer model to create spatially- and temporallyresolved spectra of Earth. Our model is a new and improved version of the VPL\xe2\x80\x99s\nspectral Earth model (Tinetti et al., 2006a,b). The model uses date speci\xef\xac\x81c information on spatially resolved atmospheric composition and cloud and surface properties\nto derive a spatially and spectrally resolved datacube. This datacube can be used\nto generate both images of Earth over a given wavelength range as well as spatially\nresolved or disk integrated spectra.\nIn our new model, the surface of Earth is divided into a number of pixels of equal\n9\n\narea according to the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix)\nmodel (http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov) (G\xc2\xb4rski et al., 2005). HEALPix partitions a\no\nsphere into a number of equal area pixels, which is ideal for a planetary model where\nthe exoplanet may be viewed at arbitrary viewing geometries. The resolution of the\nHEALPix model is de\xef\xac\x81ned by an integer N and the number of pixels used to cover a\nsphere is then equal to 12N 2 , which is a behavior inherent to the HEALPix scheme.\nA set of surface pixels are nested beneath a set of atmospheric pixels, which are\nalso de\xef\xac\x81ned according to the HEALPix scheme. Our new model allows the surface\nresolution and the atmospheric resolution to vary independently, providing improved\nsurface resolution at minimum computational cost.\nFor each surface type (see Sec. 4.1) lying beneath each atmospheric pixel, we\nrun a one-dimensional, line-by-line radiative transfer model, the Spectral Mapping\nAtmospheric Radiative Transfer (SMART) model developed by D. Crisp (Meadows\nand Crisp, 1996; Crisp, 1997), over a grid of solar zenith angles and observer zenith\nand azimuth angles, and for wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the far IR, to create\na look-up table of synthetic spectra. For a given sub-solar and sub-observer latitude\nand longitude, spectra from each atmospheric pixel are taken from the look-up table,\ninterpolated over solar and observer azimuth and zenith angles, and combined at the\nsurface resolution of the model to create a three-dimensional spectral map of Earth.\nThe spectral map can be integrated over a given wavelength range and used to create\nimages of Earth, as shown in Fig. 1, or the three-dimensional spectral map can be\nintegrated over solid angle to create a disk-integrated spectrum of Earth. Note that\nSMART is the same radiative transfer model used as the core to the Earth model\npresented in Tinetti et al. (2006a,b). The following subsections describe the input\ndata to our Earth model.\n\n10\n\n4.1\n\nSurface Properties\n\nWe determine the spatial distribution of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface types from a yearly averaged\nmap obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\ninstruments (Salomonson et al., 1989) aboard NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Terra and Aqua satellites\n(http://www-modis.bu.edu/landcover/). In general, the largest seasonal variability\nin surface re\xef\xac\x82ectivity will be due to snowfall or advancing/retreating sea ice, so the\nyearly averaged data is tailored to a speci\xef\xac\x81c date of observation by using eight-dayaveraged snow cover (Hall et al., 1995) and sea ice cover (Riggs et al., 1999) from\nMODIS observations (http://modis-snow-ice.gsfc.nasa.gov/).\nThe wavelength dependent surface re\xef\xac\x82ectivity was characterized by \xef\xac\x81ve surface\ntypes: ocean, forest, grassland, desert and snow. Specular re\xef\xac\x82ectance from liquid\nwater surfaces in our model is simulated using the Cox-Munk glint model (Cox and\nMunk, 1954), which allows for the calculation of the bidirectional re\xef\xac\x82ectance distribution function of a wave covered ocean given wind speed and direction, which are provided by the QuikSCAT satellite (http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/index.cfm).\nOther surfaces are assumed to be Lambertian and re\xef\xac\x82ect isotropically. Wavelength\ndependent albedos for non-ocean surfaces are taken from the USGS Digital Spectral\nLibrary (http://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/spectral-lib.html) and the ASTER Spectral Library (http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov/). The Cox-Munk formalism is an improvement\nin our new model over the model presented in Tinetti et al. (2006a,b), which assumed that oceans scatter as a Lambertian surfaces with an albedo near 5-6% at\nmost wavelengths.\n\n11\n\n4.2\n\nAtmospheric Properties\n\nTo simulate molecular absorption in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s visible and NIR disk integrated spectra and to accurately predict planetary brightness temperature in the mid-IR we\nrequire the three-dimensional distribution of atmospheric gases and temperatures as\ninput to the model. The model includes both Rayleigh scattering by air molecules\nas well as absorption from H2 O, CO2 , O3 , N2 O, CO, CH4 and O2 . Spatially resolved mixing ratio pro\xef\xac\x81les for atmospheric gases are obtained from the Microwave\nLimb Sounder (MLS) (Waters et al., 2006), the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer\n(TES) (Beer et al., 2001) (both aboard NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Aura satellite) and from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) (Aumann et al., 2003) aboard NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Aqua satellite\n(http://mls.jpl.nasa.gov/data/, http://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/data/, http://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/).\nAn abridged list of the species investigated by these instruments and the valid ranges\nfor pro\xef\xac\x81le retrievals are shown in Table I (Livesey et al., 2007; Payne et al., 2009).\nData from Aqua/AIRS and Aura/MLS are combined to produce spatially resolved\ntemperature pro\xef\xac\x81les. These atmospheric properties are averaged over each atmospheric pixel and resolved into 40 vertical layers prior to input to our one-dimensional\nradiative transfer model. Absorption cross sections for gases are generated using the\nHITRAN 2004 line list database (Rothman et al., 2005) (http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/).\nLine pro\xef\xac\x81les are simulated using a line-by-line absorption coe\xef\xac\x83cient model (LBLABC)\ndeveloped by D. Crisp (Meadows and Crisp, 1996).\n\n4.3\n\nClouds\n\nThe re\xef\xac\x82ectivities, optical depths, and the spatial and vertical distribution of clouds\nhave a profound e\xef\xac\x80ect on Earth\xe2\x80\x99s time variable spectrum. In our model, the spatial distribution of clouds is straightforwardly obtained from cloud coverage maps\n\n12\n\nprovided by the MODIS instruments (http://modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov/). MODIS\nprovides only cloud phase assignments (liquid, ice and undetermined), optical depth\nmeasurements, and cloud top pressure. MODIS does not directly report cloud altitude or re\xef\xac\x82ectivity. Other data sets (e.g., CloudSat or the International Satellite\nCloud Climatology Project) can provide more detailed information about cloud distribution but su\xef\xac\x80er from either poor spatial coverage or a large lag time between\ndata acquisition and release, which makes these data sets a poor choice for the date\ndependent simulations presented in this work.\nNot all locations on the planet have MODIS data recorded within a given 24 hour\nperiod. We interpolate cloud coverage and optical depths to the times of EPOXI observations using the closest Aqua/MODIS and Terra/MODIS data that bracket the\nobservation times (Wolfe, 2006). The spectral model has been improved to allow for\nan arbitrary number of cloud varieties, where a cloud variety is de\xef\xac\x81ned according to\nits phase (liquid or ice), altitude and optical thickness, whereas the previous model\n(Tinetti et al., 2006a,b) used a \xef\xac\x81xed number of cloud varieties. The previous model\nused simulated as well as satellite observed cloud locations, but allowed the global\ncoverage and optical thickness of each cloud type to be a free parameter. Our new\nmodel now \xef\xac\x81xes cloud coverage and optical depth based purely on satellite measurements, instead of allowing these to be free parameters that can be tuned to \xef\xac\x81t an\nobservation.\nTo model the clouds, we used the MODIS cloud phase identi\xef\xac\x81cation to categorize a cloud at a given spatial location as either liquid or ice. MODIS has a third\ncategory,\xe2\x80\x9cundetermined\xe2\x80\x9d, which covers \xe2\x88\xbc 1% of the planet and is neglected in our\nsimulations. Model ice clouds were placed near 8.5km (0.331 bars) altitude, and model\nwater clouds were placed near 1.5km (0.847 bars). The average cloud top pressure\nin our model agrees with the average cloud top pressure reported by MODIS. Liquid\n13\n\nand ice clouds were then sub-divided using MODIS optical depth measurements into\ntwo sub-categories, for a total of four cloud varieties. These sub-categories allow us to\nresolve di\xef\xac\x80erent cloud thicknesses in the model and can be thought of as moderately\noptically thick and optically thick cloud categories. The sub-division occurs at an\noptical depth of 10 for both liquid and ice clouds, since roughly half of all liquid and\nice clouds within the MODIS data have optical depths smaller than this value. A\nweighted average of the cloud data within these sub-categories yields best-\xef\xac\x81t optical\ndepths of 5 and 15 for our two liquid cloud types, and optical depths of 5 and 20 for\nour ice clouds types. This approach and the derived values held for all three dates of\nEPOXI observations. Wavelength dependent optical properties for liquid clouds were\nderived using a Mie theory model (Crisp, 1997) and ice clouds were parametrized\nusing geometric optics (Muinonen et al., 1989). The cloud scattering properties were\nassumed to be de\xef\xac\x81ned strictly by cloud phase (i.e., liquid or ice).\n\n4.4\n\nComparison to Previous Model\n\nTo demonstrate the signi\xef\xac\x81cant improvements made in our new model, we compare\nspectral, phase dependent results from our model to both the model described in\nTinetti et al. (2006a) as well as to EPOXI observations in Fig. 2. In this \xef\xac\x81gure,\nwe show Earth\xe2\x80\x99s wavelength dependent re\xef\xac\x82ectivity at visible and NIR wavelengths\nfor a variety of di\xef\xac\x80erent phases (full, gibbous, half illuminated or quadrature, and\ncrescent). Both models assume realistic clouds. In general, the model described\nin Tinetti et al. (2006a) is signi\xef\xac\x81cantly brighter than our new model, with the most\nextreme discrepancy occurring at 0.5 \xc2\xb5m in the crescent view, where the Tinetti et. al\nmodel is about 400% brighter than our new model. Also, the old model is distinctly\nbluer than our new model at phases between half illumination and crescent. EPOXI\n\n14\n\nobservations taken at gibbous phase and near half illumination (phase angles of 57.7\xe2\x97\xa6\nand 76.6\xe2\x97\xa6, respectively) and our model of the observations are shown as dashed lines\nin the gibbous and quadrature plots, demonstrating our ability to reproduce Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nbrightness and re\xef\xac\x82ectivity at these phases. Further validation of our model against\nmeasurements of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s phase dependent brightness and re\xef\xac\x82ectivity from Earthshine\nobservations can be found in Robinson et al. (2010).\nSome of the di\xef\xac\x80erences between the two models shown in Fig. 2 can be accounted\nfor by an error in the model described in Tinetti et al. (2006a) which rotated the angle\nbetween the Sun and the observer by 180\xe2\x97\xa6 , e\xef\xac\x80ectively confusing forward scattering\nwith backward scattering. Inserting this error into our model allows us to reproduce\nthe excess brightness in the old model near full phase, and also allows us to reproduce\nthe incorrect blue nature of the old model near quadrature and crescent phases. We\nhave not, however, been able to reproduce the excess brightness in the old model\nat phases away from full phase, indicating that other problems exist in the model\ndescribed in Tinetti et al. (2006a). It is important to note that the confusion between\nforward and backward scattering in the Tinetti et al. model compromises the phasedependent, re\xef\xac\x82ected light brightnesses and re\xef\xac\x82ectivities presented in Tinetti et al.\n(2006b).\n\n5\n5.1\n\nResults\nValidation with Lightcurves and Spectra\n\nComparisons between EPOXI observations and our model for all three epochs of\nobservation are shown in Fig. 3. These plots demonstrate the brightness of Earth\nthrough seven EPOXI bandpasses over the duration of the 24 hour observation. Both\n\n15\n\nthe data and the model have been normalized to their respective 24 hour averages\nthrough these \xef\xac\x81lters. The vertical gray line marks the beginning and end of the\nobservations. The discontinuity in normalized intensity between beginning and end\nis real, and is due to Earth\xe2\x80\x99s time varying cloud formations, which typically produce\na 3-5% change in the lightcurve over all wavelengths (relative errors for an individual\nbandpass are typically much less than 1%). The model generally reproduces the sign\nand magnitude of this discontinuity. The shaded region of the lightcurves for the\nMay set of observations marks a Lunar transit of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s disk, which is an e\xef\xac\x80ect not\nincluded in our model. The comparison between the 24 hour averaged radiance from\nthe data and our model for the March and June epochs of observation is shown in\nFig. 4. Table II shows the percent di\xef\xac\x80erence between the 24 hour average radiance\ndata and the standard March, May, and June models (models \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cb\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cc\xe2\x80\x9d,\nrespectively). The model reproduces the data on an absolute scale of radiance to\nwithin the \xe2\x88\xbc 10% uncertainty in EPOXI/HRI calibration accuracy (Klaasen et al.,\n2008). Root-mean-square (RMS) errors for the lightcurve comparisons are also shown\nin Table II. These errors measure the goodness of \xef\xac\x81t of the model lightcurves and are\ncomputed by comparing the data to the model for each bandpass at each observation\nwithin the 24 hour observing sequence. Our model reproduces the time dependent\nvariability to within 3% in most cases. Note the trend in the data of larger peakto-trough variability with increasing wavelength, with roughly 10-15% variability at\nshorter wavelengths and over 20% variability (in some cases) at longer wavelengths.\nIn addition to \xef\xac\x81tting lightcurve time variability and absolute brightness in the\nvisible, our model simultaneously reproduces the EPOXI NIR spectral data, shown\nin Fig. 5. This \xef\xac\x81gure shows comparisons between our model and the EPOXI data\nfor a variety of viewing geometries from the March set of observations as well as\nfor data from the May and June sets of observations, which are dimmer in re\xef\xac\x82ected\n16\n\nlight due to Earth phase. Residuals from the data-model comparison are also shown\nand are typically less than about 15%, demonstrating the the ability of the model\nto reproduce spectral observations on timescales from hours to months. Notable\ndisagreements occur near the center of the 1.4 \xc2\xb5m and 1.9 \xc2\xb5m water bands and near\n4.1 \xc2\xb5m, in the short wavelength wing of the 4.3 \xc2\xb5m CO2 feature. The absolute\nmagnitude of the 4.1 \xc2\xb5m defect is much smaller than the 1.4 \xc2\xb5m and 1.9 \xc2\xb5m defects.\nInstrument calibration uncertainties are typically 10%, and tend to increase below\n2.0 \xc2\xb5m and above 4.3 \xc2\xb5m (Klaasen et al., 2008).\nIn Fig. 6 we show a comparison between the 24 hour average mid-IR spectrum\nfrom our March model and a mid-IR spectrum of Earth generated from AIRS observations taken over the same timeframe (Hearty et al., 2009). The AIRS instrument\ndoes not record full disk observations of Earth, so the AIRS spectrum is assembled\nfrom multiple scenes recorded over the observational period. The fact that many\nobservations must be combined to produce a disk integrated spectrum implies that\nthis technique cannot provide the same time resolution as the EPOXI data set. In\ngeneral, the model reproduces the AIRS observations quite well, with residuals being,\non average, about 7%, and with brightness temperature errors less than 1K in the\natmospheric window.\nFor comparison we ran the original VPL Earth model (Tinetti et al., 2006a,b),\nwhich was only validated with single snapshots of Earth, using input cloud coverage\nmaps as well as atmospheric composition and temperature data for the appropriate\ndates of EPOXI observation. As the core radiative transfer model is the same in both\nEarth models, this experiment primarily tested the cloud parametrization in the two\nmodels. The comparisons between EPOXI data from March and the 2006 model are\nshown in Fig. 7 (model \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x9d). Discrepancies in the 24 hour average radiance and the\nRMS errors for the lightcurves are also shown in Table II. The inability of the model\n17\n\nto reproduce the lightcurves indicated that a new cloud parametrization was needed,\nand demonstrated the importance of validating spectral Earth models against time\nand phase resolved data.\n\n5.2\n\nModel Sensitivity\n\nOur selected atmospheric and surface resolution (48 pixels and 192 pixels, respectively) and our set of four cloud categories represent our standard model. The following set of investigations aim to determine the level of detail required in the model to\nreproduce both the visible and NIR EPOXI observations while remaining consistent\nwith the input data. The parameters used in these studies and a summary of the\nresults are shown in Table II. Lightcurves for a subset of the studies through three\nEPOXI \xef\xac\x81lters are shown in Fig. 7. Results are presented and discussed in greater\ndepth below.\n5.2.1\n\nCloud Categories: The Importance of Spectra\n\nThe characteristics that de\xef\xac\x81ne our selected cloud sub-categories are based on MODIS\ndata, but the number of cloud varieties in our model is arbitrary. While our standard\nmodel utilizes four cloud sub-categories, it is useful to know how sensitive the model\nis to the chosen number of cloud sub-categories. To test this, the model was run\nwith only a single cloud sub-category (model \xe2\x80\x9ce\xe2\x80\x9d in Table II) and with two cloud\nsub-categories. The single cloud model uses a cloud extinction optical depth of 10\nand places the cloud in the middle of the troposphere while the two cloud model\nuses liquid water clouds with an extinction optical depth of 5 and ice clouds with\nan extinction optical depth of 15, placed at the same altitudes as the liquid and ice\nwater clouds in the standard model. In all cases the characteristics of the cloud sub-\n\n18\n\ncategories were derived from MODIS observations. Example NIR spectra from these\nlow \xe2\x80\x9ccloud resolution\xe2\x80\x9d models are compared to the EPOXI data and our standard\nmodel in Fig. 8. In general, the models with less than four cloud sub-categories are\npoorer \xef\xac\x81ts to the NIR data. The single cloud model is too bright in the continuum\nregions, underestimates water vapor absorption near 1.4 \xc2\xb5m, and overestimates water\nvapor absorption near 1.1 \xc2\xb5m. Furthermore, this model cannot reproduce the shape\nof the continuum region near 1.6 \xc2\xb5m, where water ice absorbs. Thus, the EPOXI\ndisk integrated NIR spectra contain evidence for the presence of both liquid and ice\nwater clouds. The two cloud model is an improved \xef\xac\x81t, but struggles to reproduce the\nmeasured intensity within the 1.1 \xc2\xb5m and 1.4 \xc2\xb5m water features. A six cloud model\nwas run (not shown here) and did not o\xef\xac\x80er signi\xef\xac\x81cant improvements over the four\ncloud model when compared to the EPOXI data set.\nThe visible EPOXI lightcurves are less of a challenge to models due to their\nbroadband nature and the fact that these data are relatively insensitive to atmospheric\nabsorbers. Thus, the single cloud model can still reproduce the absolute brightness\nand temporal variability seen in the low spectral resolution, visible EPOXI data, as\nshown in Table II and in the \xef\xac\x81lters presented in Fig. 7 (the two cloud model can\nreproduce the visible data, and is not shown for clarity). These results emphasize the\ncrucial role that spectra play in disentangling the e\xef\xac\x80ects of clouds; the EPOXI visible,\nbroadband data can be \xef\xac\x81t with a single cloud category while four cloud varieties were\nrequired to \xef\xac\x81t the NIR data. It may also be possible to tweak the optical depths of\nthe clouds in the two cloud or the four cloud model to improve the \xef\xac\x81t to the NIR\nspectra while remaining consistent with MODIS data.\n\n19\n\n5.2.2\n\nSensitivity to Atmospheric and Surface Resolution\n\nThe atmospheric resolution determines the scale at which temperature and gas mixing\nratio pro\xef\xac\x81les are resolved while the surface resolution determines the scale at which\nsurface features are resolved. To test our sensitivity to these parameters, we ran a\nmodel with a single atmospheric pixel as well as a model with 48 surface pixels (models\n\xe2\x80\x9cf\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cg\xe2\x80\x9d in Table II, respectively). Using a single atmospheric pixel amounts\nto assuming there is no spatial variability in the temperature and composition of\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere. Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface exhibits large variations in both water vapor\nmixing ratios and surface temperatures, making a single atmospheric pixel a poor\nchoice for a model that aims to simulate these variations. For example, a model with\na single atmospheric pixel would incorrectly produce polar and equatorial thermal IR\nspectra that are nearly identical, even though, in reality, these regions can di\xef\xac\x80er in\ntemperature by over 100K. In general, though, the model with a single atmospheric\npixel can still reproduce the visible EPOXI data reasonably well since the visible data\nis relatively insensitive to atmospheric/surface temperature as well as water vapor\ndistribution. Regarding surface resolution, the coarse resolution of the 48 pixel model\n(surface pixels are several thousand kilometers in size) leads to a poor reproduction of\nthe longitudinal variations in brightness in the lightcurves at all wavelengths, which is\nshown in Fig. 7. The visible disk of Earth in this low resolution model is dominated\nby \xe2\x88\xbc 10 pixels, which leads to unrealistic periodicities in the lightcurves as relatively\nbright surface pixels rotate into and out of view.\n\n5.3\n\nComparison to Re\xef\xac\x82ectance Models\n\nTo mimic previously published re\xef\xac\x82ectance models (e.g., Williams and Gaidos, 2008),\nwe removed atmospheric absorption and scattering from our model and replaced the\n\n20\n\nMie scattering clouds in our model with a Lambertian surface with a visible re\xef\xac\x82ectance\nof 0.60, which is a typical value assumed in re\xef\xac\x82ectance models (model \xe2\x80\x9ch\xe2\x80\x9d in Table\nII). By de\xef\xac\x81nition, a re\xef\xac\x82ectance model cannot reproduce spectral data, like the NIR\nEPOXI data, because such models explicitly ignore atmospheric absorption. The 24hour average radiance is shown for the re\xef\xac\x82ectance model, the EPOXI data, and our\nstandard model in Fig. 9. The re\xef\xac\x82ectance model clearly struggles to reproduce the\nradiance data (quanti\xef\xac\x81ed in Table II), especially in the 350 nm and 950 nm \xef\xac\x81lters,\nwhich are strongly a\xef\xac\x80ected by extinction due to Rayleigh scattering and water vapor,\nrespectively. However, the re\xef\xac\x82ectance model can reproduce the relative variations in\nbrightness in the EPOXI lightcurves, as shown in Table II and in Fig. 7.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nEarth is a complex system and, as a result, any model which aims to simulate Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nappearance to a distant observer should re\xef\xac\x82ect this complexity. Our spectral Earth\nmodel aims to accurately simulate Earth\xe2\x80\x99s disk-integrated spectrum at any arbitrary\nviewing geometry and wavelength, necessitating a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of a large number of physical processes (e.g., ocean glint, realistic cloud scattering, vertically and spatially resolved temperature and gas mixing ratio pro\xef\xac\x81les).\nHowever, and as we have shown, this does not necessarily imply that more simpli\xef\xac\x81ed models cannot reproduce speci\xef\xac\x81c details of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s appearance (e.g., ocean glint\nin Williams and Gaidos (2008)). In either case, any model of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s appearance\nshould be validated against observational data, ensuring its accuracy as a predictive\nor interpretive tool.\nOur new model is capable of reproducing the time variable color and absolute\nbrightness of Earth, as observed in the visible and NIR EPOXI data, and can do\n21\n\nso for multiple dates of EPOXI observations. Typical RMS errors for the model\nlightcurves are within 3-4%, and the 24 hour average visible radiance for the model\nmatches the EPOXI observations to within calibration uncertainties. The model also\nsimultaneously provides a good \xef\xac\x81t to the shape and absolute brightness of the high\nresolution AIRS mid-IR observations.\nAlthough our \xef\xac\x81t to the lightcurves is generally good (Fig. 3), the largest rootmean-square errors are seen for the 750 nm and the 850 nm \xef\xac\x81lters, indicating that our\npoorest match to the shapes of the EPOXI lightcurves occurs at these wavelengths.\nThese \xef\xac\x81lters are relatively clear of atmospheric absorbers and are largely una\xef\xac\x80ected\nby the strong Rayleigh scattering seen in bluer \xef\xac\x81lters. As a result, these \xef\xac\x81lters are\nthe most sensitive to the surface, and mismatches in these \xef\xac\x81lters may indicate that\nmore than \xef\xac\x81ve surface types are needed to better reproduce the EPOXI data at these\nwavelengths.\nEven though our model reproduces the 24 hour average visible radiance of Earth\nto within instrument uncertainties (Fig. 4), discrepancies at short wavelengths are\ntypically in the sense of the data being brighter than the model, suggesting either a\nsystematic calibration error or residual minor defects in the model. The di\xef\xac\x80erence\nin the 24 hour average brightness between the data and the model is largest in the\n350 nm and 450 nm \xef\xac\x81lters. A small fraction of the light incident on an ocean surface\nactually enters the water and is scattered back out (Cox and Munk, 1954), which\nis an e\xef\xac\x80ect not accounted for in our model. As water is most transparent in the\n350 nm and 450 nm \xef\xac\x81lters, including this ocean \xe2\x80\x9cvolume scattering\xe2\x80\x9d behavior in our\nsimulations could improve our \xef\xac\x81ts to the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s radiance.\nNotable disagreements between the model and data in the NIR spectra occurred\nnear 1.4 \xc2\xb5m, 1.9 \xc2\xb5m, and 4.1 \xc2\xb5m. The 1.4 \xc2\xb5m and 1.9 \xc2\xb5m discrepancies occur\nat the base of water vapor absorption features, indicating problems with the input\n22\n\nMODIS water vapor distribution data, the HITRAN line lists, and/or the vertical\nplacement of clouds in our model. The height of clouds in the atmosphere controls\nthe column depth of water vapor that is available to absorb radiation incident on the\ntop of the atmosphere. For this reason, low clouds allow a longer column through the\natmosphere and more absorption by water vapor in the spectrum than high clouds.\nMODIS data does not contain a complete description of the full three-dimensional\ndistribution of clouds in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere and we must estimate standard altitudes\nfor our liquid and ice clouds. While the altitudes that we assumed seem to o\xef\xac\x80er a\nreasonably good \xef\xac\x81t overall to the NIR data, these \xef\xac\x81ts could be improved by allowing\nour clouds to have a varying vertical distribution that is determined by CloudSat\ndata (Stephens et al., 2002).\nThe disagreement near 4.1 \xc2\xb5m is in the wing of a CO2 absorption feature. E\xef\xac\x80orts\nto \xef\xac\x81t this shape by altering cloud coverage and thickness were unsuccessful. N2 O\nhas a weak absorption feature between 4.0-4.1 \xc2\xb5m, but altering atmospheric N2 O\nlevels also failed to reproduce the observed shape. SO2 absorbs in this region, but\nthe strength of this feature is even less than the N2 O feature. It is possible that\nwe are missing a trace gas which absorbs in this region, or that our CO2 linelist is\nincomplete, although a test using the more recent HITRAN 2008 database (Rothman\net al., 2009) did not improve our \xef\xac\x81t in this region.\nThe original version of the model (Tinetti et al., 2006a,b) failed to reproduce\nthe observed lightcurves primarily because this version of the model required a less\nrigorous parametrization of clouds to reproduce limited Earth-observing data sets.\nMost importantly, this earlier version of the model assumed that all ice clouds were\nquite thin with an extinction optical depth of order unity, which is true for only \xe2\x88\xbc 10 %\nof all ice clouds in the MODIS data. The model presented in this work has a much\nimproved treatment of spatially and temporally varying clouds, and parametrizes\n23\n\nthem based solely on input data collected from the MODIS instruments. Our cloud\nparametrization technique is rigorous and versatile, allowing us to reproduce all three\nsets of EPOXI observations, which span almost three months in time, without needing\nto tune model parameters to each dataset.\nIn summary, our model is designed to be comprehensive and versatile enough to\nmodel the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s appearance over a very large wavelength range and at arbitrary\nviewing angle and phase. The level of model complexity required to simultaneously\nsimulate Earth\xe2\x80\x99s spectrum over a large wavelength range, where di\xef\xac\x80erent physical\nprocesses dominate, may at \xef\xac\x81rst appear daunting. Especially if considering the reverse problem of retrieval of the correct planetary characteristics from a limited data\nset. However the more optimistic view is that in cases where a more comprehensive\nmodel is required to accurately \xef\xac\x81t Earth data, this indicates that the data contained\nenough information to allow us to discriminate the more complex environmental characteristics from more simplistic models. This would be a desirable circumstance when\nattempting to learn about extrasolar planet environments from observations. Additionally, in the process of \xef\xac\x81tting the EPOXI data we have been able to quantify when\nmodel complexity is and isn\xe2\x80\x99t required for a particular application or wavelength\nrange subset.\nFor example, modeling moderate resolution NIR spectra does require multiple categories of clouds, providing cloud altitude, phase, and optical thickness resolution. As\ndemonstrated in Fig. 8, a single cloud category produces a disk integrated spectrum\nthat is too bright in the NIR continuum and underestimates water vapor absorption\nin some regions (near 1.4 \xc2\xb5m) while overestimating water vapor absorption at other\nwavelength regions (near 1.1 \xc2\xb5m). The lack of ice clouds leads to discrepancies near\n1.5 \xc2\xb5m where ice particles absorb. A model with two cloud categories reproduces the\nspectral data more accurately than the single cloud model, but struggles with the\n24\n\nshape of the 1.1 \xc2\xb5m and 1.4 \xc2\xb5m water features. Residuals for the two cloud model\ncan be over 40% larger than the residuals for the four cloud model in these regions.\nThe four cloud model therefore appears to be optimal for simultaneously \xef\xac\x81tting both\nthe visible and NIR spectral regions, and would be most useful for studying the detectability of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s globally averaged characteristics for TPF-like designs that span\nboth the visible and NIR.\nThe absolute brightness and temporal variability of the EPOXI lightcurves can\nbe reproduced by models without a large number of cloud categories due to the\nbroadband nature of these data and the fact that observations at these wavelengths are\nrelatively insensitive to atmospheric absorption. In essence, the broadband lightcurves\nprovide evidence for white, highly re\xef\xac\x82ective structures that vary in time on the planet,\nand observations in the 950 nm \xef\xac\x81lter demonstrate an absorption feature from water\nvapor. The higher spectral resolution NIR data provide information regarding the\nphase and vertical distribution of these structures. Furthermore, insofar as both\nliquid water and ice clouds are required to reproduce the observations near 1.5 \xc2\xb5m,\nthe broadband data and moderate resolution spectra demonstrate that water is found\nin the atmosphere as vapor, liquid, and ice.\nSensitivity tests indicate that high atmospheric resolution is not needed to reproduce the EPOXI visible photometric data. This is not surprising as at visible the\ntemperature structure and distribution of trace gases within the atmosphere should\nhave only small e\xef\xac\x80ects on the lightcurves. Even data in the 950 nm \xef\xac\x81lter, which contains a large water vapor absorption feature, can still be \xef\xac\x81t due to variations in the\nbrightness of the continuum outside the absorption feature and the fact that clouds\ncontrol the column depth of water vapor that is available to absorb radiation. Earth\nexhibits large variations in both water vapor mixing ratios and surface temperatures,\nindicating that models with low atmospheric resolution are poor choices for modeling\n25\n\nhigh resolution spectral data or mid-IR data, especially if the model aims to generate\nobservations for arbitrary viewing geometries (e.g, polar versus equatorial views).\nRe\xef\xac\x82ectance models that ignore scattering and absorption in the atmosphere and\nwhich treat clouds as Lambertian re\xef\xac\x82ectors cannot reproduce the 24 hour averaged\nbrightness of Earth. The short wavelength \xef\xac\x81lters have lower re\xef\xac\x82ectivity than the\ndata because Rayleigh scattering has been ignored while longer wavelength \xef\xac\x81lters\n(e.g., the 950 nm \xef\xac\x81lter, which contains a strong water feature) show enhanced re\xef\xac\x82ectivity because atmospheric absorption has been ignored. Re\xef\xac\x82ectance models can,\nhowever, reproduce the shapes of the EPOXI lightcurves as these models are designed\nto reproduce relative brightness variations due to structures (e.g., clouds, continents)\nrotating into and out of view. While simple, computationally inexpensive models, like\nre\xef\xac\x82ectance models, may be useful as retrieval tools in scenarios where observational\ndata are limited or of poor quality, these models are not optimal when compared\nto more rigorous and comprehensive spectral models for applications which require\naccurate predictions.\nOur validated model has a variety of applications. In Robinson et al. (2010), the\nmodel was used to demonstrate that surface oceans on Earthlike extrasolar planets\nmay be detectable, even after considering the confusing e\xef\xac\x80ects of forward scattering\nfrom clouds. The Tinetti et al. (2006a,b) model could not perform such a study as\nit did not simulate specular re\xef\xac\x82ection from ocean surfaces, and re\xef\xac\x82ectance models,\nwhile excellent at reproducing glint, could not address the important issue of phase\ndependent aerosol scattering when investigating the detection of ocean glint in the\npresence of clouds (Williams and Gaidos, 2008). In Cowan et al. (2011), the model\npresented here was used to simulate observations of a distant Earth to validate and\nbetter understand a retrieval method for exoplanets.\nOur comprehensive model is uniquely capable of investigating a variety of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\n26\n\ntraits over wavelength ranges, synoptic views, and vantage points that are unavailable\nto Earth observing spacecraft or satellites. For example, future applications could\ninclude model generated disk integrated, ultraviolet, visible or IR spectra of Earth\nfor a variety of sub-observer points and phases. These simulated datasets could be\nused, among other applications, to investigate the wavelength dependent e\xef\xac\x80ect of\nclouds on our ability to measure thermal radiation from the surface, or to simulate\nEarth as seen from a lunar vantage point over a complete lunar orbit. We could, also,\ninvestigate the e\xef\xac\x80ects of an unresolved, airless satellite on the spectrum of its host\nby pairing our simulations with a model of the spectrum of the Moon. Finally, our\nEarth model could also be used to generate synthetic observations for \xe2\x80\x9cblind\xe2\x80\x9d tests\nof retrieval models, where other individuals or teams attempt to retrieve planetary\ncharacteristics without knowing the input to our Earth model (e.g., season, viewing\ngeometry, phase). In general, simulated data can be used to test techniques aimed at\ncharacterizing habitable planets that may be employed by TPF-class missions.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have developed and validated a three-dimensional spectral model of Earth that\nis capable of reproducing the temporal variability and absolute brightness of observations in both the visible, NIR, and MIR. Earth\xe2\x80\x99s visible lightcurves are strongly\ndependent on cloud spatial distribution and re\xef\xac\x82ectivity. To simultaneously reproduce\nthe EPOXI visible and NIR observations of Earth we used four categories of water\nclouds de\xef\xac\x81ned using data from the MODIS instruments. Smaller amounts of cloud\ncategories can reproduce the visible EPOXI data (which is at a very low spectral resolution, R \xe2\x88\xbc 6), but cannot reproduce the moderate resolution (R \xe2\x88\xbc 500) NIR data.\nOur simulations are relatively insensitive to variations in the surface resolution and\n27\n\ncan also reproduce the EPOXI lightcurves at a very low atmospheric resolution. The\nmodel can now be used as a forward model to explore the detectability of planetary\ncharacteristics by generating synthetic observations of Earth from the far ultraviolet\nto the far IR at a variety of spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported by the NASA Discovery Program and the EPOXI mission.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the Deep Impact/EPOXI\noperations team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology, without whom Earth observations could not have been accomplished.

(2006a,b) model (old model, gray)\nand our new model (black). A measure of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s re\xef\xac\x82ectivity, taken as \xcf\x80 times the\ndisk integrated radiance (in W/m2 /\xc2\xb5m/sr) divided by the Solar \xef\xac\x82ux at 1 A.U (in\nW/m2 /\xc2\xb5m), is shown for the planet viewed at full phase, gibbous phase, quadrature\n(i.e., half illuminated), and crescent phase, or, alternatively, phase angles of 0\xe2\x97\xa6 , 45\xe2\x97\xa6 ,\n90\xe2\x97\xa6 ,and 135\xe2\x97\xa6 , respectively. Both models use realistic cloud cover, and the data for the\nold model is taken from the left column of Figure 6 in Tinetti et al. (2006b). EPOXI\nobservations taken at phase angles of 57.7\xe2\x97\xa6 and 76.6\xe2\x97\xa6 (dashed gray) and our model\nof the observations (dashed black) are shown in the gibbous and quadrature cases,\ndemonstrating that our model correctly reproduces the brightness and spectral shape\nof the data at these phases. In general, the Earth model from Tinetti et al. (2006a,b)\nis about 100% to 400% too bright, and is too blue at phases near quadrature and\ncrescent. Earth views generated by the Earth and Moon Viewer, \xef\xac\x81rst implemented\nby J. Walker (http://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/Earth/).\n\nFIG. 3. Lightcurves of data (solid) and our new and improved model (dashed)\nfor EPOXI observations from March (left), May (center), and June (right). March\nobservations begin at 2008-Mar-18 18:18 UT, May observations begin at 2008-May28 20:05 UT, and June observations begin at 2008-Jun-4 16:57 UT. The \xef\xac\x81lter center\nwavelength is noted in the central column. Model values and data have been normal38\n\nized to their respective 24 hour averages. The shaded region in the central column\nmarks a Lunar transit of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s visible disk, which is an e\xef\xac\x80ect not included in our\nspectral model. The vertical gray line indicates where the observations begin and,\n24 hours later, end. The discontinuity here is a real e\xef\xac\x80ect due to time varying cloud\nstructure and is of order 2-3% in March. The discontinuity tends to be smaller in the\nMay observations and larger in the June observations. The model generally reproduces the scale and sense of these discontinuities.\n\nFIG. 4. Comparison of the 24 hour averaged signal for the model (dashed) with\nthe EPOXI data (solid) for the March (upper) and June (lower) dates of observation, demonstrating our \xef\xac\x81t to the data on an absolute scale. Note that the June\nobservations are overall dimmer than the March observations due to Earth phase.\nThe largest discrepancies are typically in the 450 nm \xef\xac\x81lter and are \xe2\x88\xbc 8% for both\nobservations, within the 10% absolute error in the HRI calibration (Klaasen et al.,\n2008). The average spectrum of the May observations is similar to that of the June\nobservations (i.e., within a few percent) and were omitted for clarity.\n\nFIG. 5. Near-infrared spectral comparison of the model (dashed) with EPOXI\ndata (solid) for a variety of observations, demonstrating the ability of the model\nto reproduce moderate spectral resolution observations on timescales from hours to\nmonths. Note the di\xef\xac\x80erent scales used for the y-axes on the left and right sides of\nthe spectral plots and also note that the model has not been scaled to match the\ndata. Date indicators and sub-observer longitudes are given at the top of each plot.\nProminent absorption features have been labeled in the upper-left plot. May (middleright) and June (lower-right) observations are dimmer in re\xef\xac\x82ected light due to Earth\nphase. Residuals for the data-model comparison are shown below each plot and are\n\n39\n\ntypically less than about 15%. Stronger disagreements tend to occur between 1.11.2 \xc2\xb5m (water), between 1.35-1.5 \xc2\xb5m (water), and between 3.9-4.15 \xc2\xb5m (N2 O, wing\nof CO2 feature). Extremely low signal levels and instrument artifacts lead to large\nresiduals in the 2.5-3.25 \xc2\xb5m range. Instrument calibration uncertainties are typically\n10%, and tend to increase below 2.0 \xc2\xb5m and above 4.3 \xc2\xb5m (Klaasen et al., 2008).\nEarth views generated by the Earth and Moon Viewer.\n\nFIG. 6. Mid-infrared, 24 hour average spectra of Earth from our March model\n(dashed) and as generated from AIRS observations (solid) (Hearty et al., 2009). In\ngeneral, the agreement is quite good, with residuals (lower panel) being typically\n\xe2\x88\xbc 7%. Large gaps are regions where the instrument does not return data. Note\nthat the AIRS instrument does not record full disk observations, so disk integrated\nobservations are generated from multiple scenes recorded over a 24 hour period. Thus,\nthis technique cannot achieve the same time resolution as the EPOXI data set.\n\nFIG. 7. Comparison between the EPOXI data and a variety of models considered\nin this work through a subset of the EPOXI \xef\xac\x81lters for the March set of observations.\nFilter center wavelength is noted on each plot. The details of the models shown\nare outlined in Table II. Model \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d: standard model; model \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x9d: 2006 version of\nmodel Tinetti et al. (2006a,b); model \xe2\x80\x9ce\xe2\x80\x9d: single cloud category; model \xe2\x80\x9cf\xe2\x80\x9d: single\natmospheric pixel; model \xe2\x80\x9cg\xe2\x80\x9d: 48 surface pixels; model \xe2\x80\x9ch\xe2\x80\x9d: re\xef\xac\x82ectance model. Filters\nwere selected to demonstrate the e\xef\xac\x80ects of Rayleigh scattering (350 nm) and water\nabsorption (950 nm). The 650 nm \xef\xac\x81lter is relatively free of atmospheric extinction.\n\nFIG. 8. Comparison between the EPOXI data (solid), our standard model\n(dashed), a model run with a single cloud category (dotted), and a model run with\n\n40\n\ntwo cloud categories (dot-dashed) for a view over the Paci\xef\xac\x81c Ocean on 2008-Mar-18\nUT. Note the di\xef\xac\x80erent scales used for the y-axes on the left and right sides of the\nspectral plots. While the single cloud model and the two cloud model can reproduce\nthe visible EPOXI lightcurves, they cannot reproduce the NIR data.\n\nFIG. 9. Comparison of the 24 hour averaged signal (top) for the EPOXI data\n(solid), our standard model (dashed), and a model where atmospheric absorption and\nscattering has been removed and clouds have been treated as a Lambertian surface\nwith an albedo of 0.60 (dotted). The data and models have been converted to a\nmeasure of re\xef\xac\x82ectance (bottom) in the same fashion as in Fig. 2. The e\xef\xac\x80ects of\nignoring Rayleigh scattering can be seen in the shortest wavelength \xef\xac\x81lters while the\nlack of atmospheric absorption is especially apparent in the 950 nm \xef\xac\x81lter, which\nincludes a strong water absorption feature. Data and models are all for the March\nobservations.\n\n41\n\nFigure 1:\n\n42\n\nFigure 2:\n\n43\n\nFigure 3:\n\n44\n\nFigure 4:\n\n45\n\nFigure 5:\n\n46\n\nFigure 6:\n\n47\n\nFigure 7:\n\n48\n\nFigure 8:\n\n49\n\nFigure 9:\n\n50\n\n'
