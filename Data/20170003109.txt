Although this frequency band\nis allocated to passive measurements only, RFI (RadioFrequency Interference) is present in the data of all three\nmissions. On a global scale, the three sensors have observed\napproximately the same distribution of RFI. Japan is an\nimportant exception that has implications for the design of\nRFI detection algorithms. RFI in Japan is caused by a large\nnumber of emitters belonging to the same system (TV\nreceivers) and for this reason some traditional RFI detection\nstrategies detect little to no RFI over Japan. The study of this\ncase has led to an improvement of the approach to detect\nRFI in Aquarius data.\nIndex Terms\xe2\x80\x94 RFI, Aquarius, SMAP, SMOS\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIn the recent years, three missions have been launched with\nthe aim of making global maps of sea surface salinity and/or\nsoil moisture using passive measurements of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nemissions within the 1400-1427 MHz band. These missions\nare: SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) operated by\nESA (European Space Agency) [1]; Aquarius onboard\nAquarius/SAC-D observatory, which is a collaboration\nbetween NASA (National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration) and CONAE (Comisi\xc3\xb3n Nacional de\nActividades Espaciales) [2]; and SMAP (Soil Moisture\nActive/Passive) operated by NASA [3].\nAlthough these missions have passive instruments\noperating in a frequency range that is allocated to passive\nmeasurements only, RFI (Radio-Frequency Interference) is\npresent in the data of all three missions, and each team has\nput significant effort to cope with this issue.\n2. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\nJapan, as seen by SMOS, had only moderate levels of RFI\ncontamination until the end of September 2011. Then,\nbetween September 21st and September 27th, RFI suddenly\n\nappeared in large portions of the country and is still present\ntoday.\nAquarius, which had started acquiring measurements\nshortly before this event, recorded a sudden increase in the\naverage antenna temperatures (TA) measured over Japan\naround the same time. This increase is clearly visible in the\ntime series of TA over the major Japanese cities. Figure 1\nshows the TA (average of V- and H-polarization) over\nNagoya for the period September 2011 to October 2012 as\nmeasured by two of the Aquarius radiometers. Each data\npoint is an average within a 50 km radius centered over the\ncity of Nagoya. Figure 1 also shows the time series of\nexpected antenna temperatures (dashed lines). These values\nare distributed as part of the Aquarius product and they are\ncomputed from models of land and ocean emissivity and\nancillary meteorological data. The expected values remain\nrelatively constant over the entire period. The measured\nvalues display a clear increase in September 2011 and again\nin February 2012. However, this increase in TA did not\ncorrespond to an increase in the level of detected RFI in the\nAquarius processing.\n\n650\n600\n550\n\nantenna temperature [K]\n\n(2)\n\n50 km radius over center of Nagoya\nbeam 1, obs\nbeam 1, exp\nbeam 2 obs\nbeam 2, exp\n\n500\n450\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n012\n012\n011\n012\n011\n012\n012\n011\n011\n011\n201\n201 ct-201\n201\n201\npran-2 -Jan-2 -Feb-2 -Mararep-2 -Octay-2 -May-2\nov-2 -Nov-2 -Dec-2\n28\n08-J\n15-A\n22-O\n03\n16\n26-M\n07\n13-S\n20\n30\n11-N\n24\n04-M\n\nug-2\n\n25-A\n\nFig. 1.

RFI CHARACTERISTICS OBSERVED\nFROM REMOTE SENSING DATA\nIn order to understand why the level of detected RFI did not\nincrease in Aquarius, and to consider ways to improve its\nRFI detection strategy, the RFI in Japan was studied using\nall available sensors. Together, data from SMOS, Aquarius\n\nand SMAP, allows one to retrieve information about the\nRFI, which can be used to assess which approach works best\nto detect RFI of this kind.\n\nof TA is approximately the same on both ends of the\nprotected band.\n\n3.1. Time domain\nAquarius and SMAP provide data on short time intervals: 10\nms for Aquarius [4] and 300 \xc2\xb5s for SMAP [5]. However,\neven with these high temporal sampling rates, the RFI in\nJapan does not create obvious outliers in the time series of\nmeasured antenna temperatures. Rather, the mean measured\nantenna temperatures vary slowly, similar to what is\nexpected near coastlines. Figure 2 shows an example from\nAquarius. Although the values of TA (bottom panel) indicate\nthe presence of RFI, there are no outliers in the time series\nof 10 ms short accumulations (top panel) that is used for RFI\ndetection. In fact, the time-domain outlier detection\nalgorithm used in Aquarius and SMAP detect only few\nsamples as RFI.\n\nFig. 3. Average SMAP TA over Osaka as a function of frequency.\nThe central sub-band (at 1413.5 MHz) has TA consistent with\nnatural emissions, while both ends have a significantly higher level\nand are clearly affected by RFI.\n\n3.3. Horizontal and vertical polarizations\n\n(a)\n\nThe presence of RFI increases the signal received by realaperture radiometers. This leads to brightness temperatures\nthat are higher than the level expected from natural\nemissions alone. In SMOS, which employs a synthetic\naperture radiometer, the RFI signal can both increase and\ndecrease the retrieved brightness temperatures in the image\n[6].\nSMOS is able to detect this particular type of RFI by\ncomparing the measured brightness temperatures with\nthresholds based on the minimum and maximum level of\nbrightness temperature expected from the natural emissions.\nHowever, a similar approach is not applied in SMAP and\nAquarius RFI algorithms.\n3.4. Third and fourth Stokes parameters\n\n(b)\nFig. 2. Time series of the 10-ms short accumulations (a) and the\ncorresponding antenna temperatures (b) measured by the Aquarius\nmiddle beam on January 2nd, 2012, during an orbit over Nagoya,\nJapan. Even though TA higher than 400 K indicate the presence of\nRFI, there are no obvious outliers in either time series.\n\n3.2. Frequency domain\nSMAP also provides the possibility to characterize the RFI\nemissions in frequency by dividing the received signal into\n16 spectral sub-bands. Figure 3 shows the amplitude of the\nmeasured TA as a function of frequency, for the city of\nOsaka during one orbit on June 1st, 2015. TA is high towards\nboth edges of the protected band with little to no RFI\ncontamination at the center of the band. Also, the amplitude\n\nThe 3rd and 4th Stokes parameters have been considered for\nthe detection of RFI [7, 8] as they are expected to be close to\nzero for emissions from natural targets [9, 10]. The Japanese\nRFI is not clearly visible from measurements of the 3rd\nStokes parameter. The 4th Stokes parameter measurements\nprovided by SMOS and SMAP are also difficult to exploit as\nthey are affected by significant noise and by the vicinity\nwith coastlines.\n3.5. Kurtosis and skewness\nOther RFI detection approaches are based on the statistical\ndistribution of the measured TA. These approaches measure\nthe kurtosis of the incoming signal and compare it with the\nvalue expected from a normal distribution (equal to three)\n[9, 12]. The skewness has not been considered to detect RFI,\nbut it is also an indicator that describes the shape of the\n\nstatistical distribution, and therefore it could also be used to\ndetect anomalies.\nHowever, both the kurtosis and the skewness computed\nfrom the statistical moments provided in SMAP L1A data\ndo not show any appreciable deviation from the Gaussian\nvalues over Japan. As far as the statistical distribution is\nconcerned, this RFI appears as if it were a thermal source\n(its distribution is Gaussian), only warmer.\n4. IMPROVEMENT OF THE RFI DETECTION\nSTRATEGY IN AQUARIUS\nIn many aspects (statistical distribution, 3rd and 4th Stokes\nparameters, time series), the RFI in Japan presents the\ncharacteristics of thermal noise and it is therefore difficult\nto detect with the outlier detection algorithm implemented in\nAquarius [11]. Two criteria are able to correctly detect this\nRFI: the cross-frequency outlier detection (used in SMAP),\nand comparing the measurements with thresholds based on\nthe expected natural emission (used in SMOS). The former,\nhowever, cannot be implemented in Aquarius since the\nreceived signal is not filtered into different sub-band; also, it\nis possible that if the RFI signal had a uniform spectrum\nwithin the protected band, even this approach might not be\nable to detect it.\nIn order to improve RFI detection, the Aquarius\nalgorithm can compare the measured antenna temperatures\nagainst a threshold, based on the highest antenna\ntemperature expected from the natural scene. This threshold\nis obtained assuming an ideal surface (flat, homogeneous\nwith no vegetation layer) and using the Mironov model [12]\nfor the dielectric constant of soil and assuming perfectly dry\nsoil (zero soil moisture). To establish an upper limit, the\nthermodynamic temperature is assumed to be 340 K. If the\nobserved antenna temperature exceeds that computed for\nthis surface in the Aquarius simulator, a flag will be raised.\nFigure 4 shows the percent of measurements flagged as\nRFI: by Aquarius outlier detection algorithm (b), by\nAquarius, after adding the comparison with a fixed threshold\n(c) and by SMOS (c).\nImplementing this additional detection algorithm in\nAquarius increases the level of RFI detected in Japan, and\nthe spatial distribution of detected RFI becomes similar to\nthat of the RFI detected by SMOS.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe RFI in Japan affects measurements from all three\npassive L-band satellites. While most RFI are caused by\nindividual emitters, the Japanese RFI is caused by a large\nnumber of emitters belonging to the same system and\ntherefore with the same characteristics. Experiments in 2015\nindicated a TV broadcast system as the source of RFI and\npointed to an intermediate frequency in the TV receiver as\nthe source.\n\n(c)\nFig. 4. Percent of measurements flagged as RFI over Japan [%].\n(a) Aquarius outlier detection algorithm; (b) Aquarius outlier\ndetection algorithm and thresholds; (c) SMOS.\n\nThese small independent signals appear to add up\nrandomly resulting in a total contribution that is: a) of a\nsignificant level, and b) has the characteristics of thermal\nnoise. Hence, outlier detectors such as those employed by\nAquarius and kurtosis detectors such as on SMAP fail to\ndetect RFI even though the level is substantially above the\nvalue one would expect from a natural surface. SMOS\nemploys a threshold detection algorithm, which detected the\nchange in RFI, and SMAP detects RFI due to the particular\nspectrum of the RFI signal.\nThis analysis has led to the addition of an extra criterion\nto detect interference in the Aquarius processing. In\nparticular, a threshold option has been added to the criterion\nfor detecting RFI. In the next release of Aquarius data, RFI\nwill also be detected by comparing the measured antenna\ntemperatures against an absolute threshold based on the\nmaximum expected level of natural emissions.\n6.
