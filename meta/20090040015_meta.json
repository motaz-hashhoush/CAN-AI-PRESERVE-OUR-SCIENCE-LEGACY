LEGEND can mimic the growth of the historical debris population and project it into the future based on user-defined scenarios. The first major LEGEND study concluded that even without any future launches, the LEO population would continue to increase due to mutual collisions among existing objects. In reality, the increase will be worse than this prediction because of ongoing satellite launches and unexpected major breakups. Even with a full implementation of the commonly-adopted mitigation measures, the LEO population growth is inevitable. To preserve the near-Earth environment for future generations, active debris removal (ADR) must be considered. A follow-up LEGEND ADR study was completed recently. The main results indicate that (1) the mass and collision probability of each object can be used to establish an effective removal selection criterion and (2) a removal rate of ~5 objects per year is sufficient to stabilize the LEO environment. Due to the limitation of removal techniques, however, different target selection criteria (in size, altitude, inclination, etc.) may be more practical. A careful evaluation of the effectiveness of different proposed techniques must be carried out to maximize the long-term benefit to the environment.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20090040015, "endDate": "2009-12-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency", "location": "Arlington, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "23cd8be1c9c04f309fb5de6e4d05f7d8", "id": "15e1a4221b9647888f4b2bc0185f9440"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "23cd8be1c9c04f309fb5de6e4d05f7d8", "id": "7d16d8b26dad40559c1c12791e71a781"}], "name": "International Conference on Orbital Debris", "location": "Chantilly, Virginia", "id": "23cd8be1c9c04f309fb5de6e4d05f7d8", "startDate": "2009-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090040015, "id": "02cf7040637740198a0de40b34a076e1", "publicationDate": "2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
