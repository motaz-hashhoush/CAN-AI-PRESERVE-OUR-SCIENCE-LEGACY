The only reliable temperature profile measured below 12 km altitude was obtained in 1985 by the\nVeGa-2 lander [1,2]. This profile, obtained during the ~1h descent, is highly unstable in the lowest 7 km. This\nwould imply that the near-constant vertical gradient is steeper than the adiabat \xe2\x80\x93 a characteristic that may be\nexplained by a variation of the abundance of nitrogen from 3.5% at 7 km altitude to 0 at the surface [3] (see\nFig.1).\n\nMotivation\n\nThe physics of the composition gradient is difficult to understand in the absence of more\ninformation. However, considering the observations in a recent experiment (Hendry et al., 2013 [4], see Fig. 2),\nwe conjectured that this gradient could result from gravity effects inducing a density-driven separation of\nnitrogen and carbon dioxide.\n0.035\nFigure 2 : The Hendry et al. (2013) experiment [4].\nThe experiment vessel was 18 cm tall, and was filled with\nCO2 and N2 at pressures ranging from 100 to 310 bar, at\nroom temperature (296K). CO2 was introduced first, then\nN2, to reach a molar mix of 50%/50%. The gas was let to\nrest for \xc2\xab several hours \xc2\xbb then the composition was\nmeasured with a Gas Chromatograph at four different\nlocations in the vessel (top, bottom, and two intermediate\npoints).\nAt 296K, 100 bar, the composition was reported to be\nstable, with 70% N2 at the top and 90% CO2 at the bottom.\nThe authors claim that this gradient is stable and due to a\ndensity-driven separation of the two gases.\n\nGC measurements\nof mole fractions\n\nFill :\nCO2 first,\nthen N2\n\nH=18 cm\n\nz\n\n50 % N2\n50 % CO2\n(moles)\n296K, 100 bar\nFigure 1 : The potential temperature profile measured by the VeGa-2 probe is\n\nD=8.7 cm\n0. 0.1\n\n0.5 0.7\n\nxN2\n\nGEER experiment To investigate the behavior of the CO2-N2 mixture under conditions ranging\nfrom the Hendry et al. (2013) experiment [4] to the near-surface atmosphere of Venus, we designed an\nexperiment that was conducted at the Glenn Extreme Environment Rig (GEER) [5], at NASA Glenn\nResearch Center in Cleveland in August 2018 (Figs. 3 and 4).\nThis experiment was funded by the NASA Solar System Workings Program.\nN2\nthen\nCO2\n\npremix\ntank\n\ninject needed mass\nto get to 100 bar\n\nGC control\nof mix composition\n\nGEER\nTest\nvessel\n\nCO2\nthen\nN2\n\nGC or MS\ncomposition\nmeasurements\ninject same mass\nas for the premix\n\n60 cm\n\nT\n\n8.7 cm\n\nFigure 3 : The GEER chamber [5].\n(top) Front end, with the three sampling lines.\n(bottom) Inside, with the thermal heaters and the test vessel for our\nexperiment.\n\nFigure 4 : Experiment set-up.\n\nTo vary the experimental conditions from the Hendry et al.\n(2013) experiment to Venusian conditions, the following tests\nwere done :\nP (bar)\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\nT (K)\n\n296\n\n310\n\n310\n\n310\n\n500\n\n735\n\n% CO2\n\n50\n\n50\n\n80\n\n97\n\n97\n\n97\n\n% N2\n\nFigure 5: Critical points for the various mix used.\n\nxN2\n\n0\n\n50\n\n50\n\n20\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\nEach experiment was done first with a well-mixed batch of gas,\nthen, using the same masses of each gas, for a mix done by\ninserting first CO2, then N2, as was done in the Hendry et al.\n(2013) experiment.\n\nhighly unstable in the lowest 7 kilometers (black). A neutral profile can be\nobtained (A, red/green) if the mean molecular mass varies with height (B,\nred/green). This corresponds to a vertical gradient in the mole fraction of N2 [3].\n\nResults\n(1) For the well-mixed batch of gas, the composition was measured\nat all three ports during roughly 15 hours in each configuration.\nThe results are always the same: the composition is identical at all\nthree ports, and stable. No density-driven separation is\nobserved.\n(2) To understand the Hendry et al. experiment, the same protocol\nwas used: introducing CO2 first, then N2. To reproduce the same mix\nof gas, the same masses were used for each gas. In these cases,\nthe first samples indicated nearly 100% CO2 at the bottom port and\nnearly 100% N2 at the top port. The composition evolved very\nslowly over time at each port, with time scales of the order of\n10 days. The composition was measured over at least 24 hours,\nover 3 days for the first and last tests, with continous (but slow)\ncomposition variations.\nThis may explain the results of the Hendry et al. experiment. It was\nnot a stable situation, but rather a slowly evolving mix.\nA full analysis of the experiment results will be done in the coming\nmonths.\nPressure evolution (non-ideal behavior)\nAt 296K and 310K, inserting the gases one after the other results in a\npeculiar behavior. When filled with exactly the same mass of each\ncomponent as for the well-mixed batch, the pressure after filling is not\n100 bar, but significantly less (80 bar for the 50%/50% mix), and the\npressure rises slowly with time. This behavior is explained by the fact\nthat CO2 (even with a small amount of N2) is close to the critical point,\nand, therefore, the density in the bottom of the vessel is significantly\ngreater than for an ideal gas. The non-homogeneous system has to\nbalance nearly-pure N2 at the top and nearly-pure CO2 at the bottom.\nThe resulting pressure is much less than for the well-mixed gas. As\nmixing occurs, the amount of N2 in the CO2 at the bottom of the tank\nincreases and the density of the mix changes, resulting in a continous\nincrease in pressure.\nThis behavior is not observed at the higher temperatures of the\ncurrent experiment.\nDiffusion timescales\nIn the vessel, diffusion may occur through small-scale turbulence\nduring the initial fill, but may be dominated by molecular diffusion after\nresting for a while.\nThe molecular diffusion coefficient for the binary mix CO 2/N2 is :\nD = 0.16 cm\xc2\xb2/s @ 1 bar, 293K => D ~ 1.6 10-3 cm\xc2\xb2/s @ 100 bar, 296K\nTime scale for molecular diffusion in the test vessel (L~60 cm) :\n\xef\x81\xb4 ~ L2/D ~ 2 106 s ~ 26 days\n( \xef\x81\xb4 ~ 7 days @ 100 bar, 735K)\n\nConclusions - Perspectives\nThis experiment clearly showed that there is no peculiar density-driven separation in the CO 2 / N2 mixture occuring at 100 bar. When these two gases are well-mixed, they stay\nwell-mixed over the time scales used in this experiment. However, it also showed that when CO 2 and N2 are stratified, it may be difficult to mix them.\nHow to explain the gradient in composition suggested by the VeGa-2 temperature profile in the 7-kilometer layer above the surface of Venus, then ?\nCould there be unexpected sources or sinks of CO 2 and/or N2 near the surface of Venus ? This question needs to be thoroughly investigated.\nWe also emphasize that additional in-situ data from the near-surface layer of the Venusian atmosphere is crucial ! We will not be able to understand the processes occuring\nnear and at the surface of Venus without a new mission to investigate this harsh but surprising environment.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe team acknowledges support from NASA Solar System Workings Program.\n\nReferences [1] Linkin et al., Sov.
