It is challenging to deliver heavy payloads to the lunar surface in support of these goals given currently available Earth launch systems.  The payload capacity of the launch systems limits the size of the lunar landers, thereby limiting their cargo capacity.  Fortunately, lander cargo capacity can be significantly increased if multiple landers are joined together in space.  This concept has been previously introduced as the Joinable Undercarriage to Maximize Payload (JUMP) Lander.  Utilizing a JUMP Lander system will increase options and make it easier to comply with directives issued by senior White House leadership to initiate long duration human activity on the Moon.  Such activity, by definition, implies extensive habitation, mobility, research, and resource development capability that in turn calls for significant mass delivery to the lunar surface.  This paper develops three concept illustration variants of the JUMP Lander.  These concepts explore hypergolic, hydrogen, and methane propellant options, as well as the power and thermal rejection systems necessary to enable such lander concepts.  The paper also estimates masses for the necessary avionics, structures, and mechanical subsystems.  The paper documents the resulting configurations and recommends a JUMP Lander to carry forward in further development.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20205007727, "endDate": "2020-11-18T06:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "b0936abaa1cf4ee092fd99496a12f3e7", "id": "708c4bdf6fca4f2ba1f345d2a4fbeb6c"}], "name": "AIAA ASCEND", "location": "Online", "id": "b0936abaa1cf4ee092fd99496a12f3e7", "url": "https://www.ascend.events/", "startDate": "2020-11-16T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20205007727, "publisher": "AIAA", "id": "dae099ba96c74a2581682189efaf15be", "publicationName": "2020 ASCEND Conference Proceedings", "publicationDate": "2020-11-16T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "FINAL - Development of Concept Illustration Variants of the JUMP Lander.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205007727/downloads/FINAL%20-%20Development%20of%20Concept%20Illustration%20Variants%20of%20the%20JUMP%20Lander.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205007727/downloads/FINAL%20-%20Development%20of%20Concept%20Illustration%20Variants%20of%20the%20JUMP%20Lander.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205007727/downloads/FINAL%20-%20Development%20of%20Concept%20Illustration%20Variants%20of%20the%20JUMP%20Lander.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
