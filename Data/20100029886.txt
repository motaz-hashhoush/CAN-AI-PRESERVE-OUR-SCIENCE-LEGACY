Recently, this commitment was\nacknowledged by the Small Business Administration, which gave\nLockheed Space Operations Company the Eisenhower Award\nfor Excellence.\nLast year alone, Lockheed companies awarded\nmore than $114 million in subcontracts to 2,500 small\ndisadvantaged businesses. Over the last 10 years, the\nfigure approaches $700 million.\nToday, we\'re continuing the search for\nminority firms to bid competitively for contracts.\nWe\'re particularly interested in companies who\ncan provide goods or services in high-technology areas such\nas advanced electronics, aeronautics and space systems.\nIf your minority-owned company qualifies as a small disadvantaged\nbusiness and offers a product or service we need at a competitive price, we\nwant to hear from you.

The faint outline of a new space station drifting across the night sky. Finding it took a remarkable group\n\nof engineers. ~ And an equally remarkable computer. The Apple Macintosh. Why did they choose Macintosh?\n\nMaybe they\n\nwanted computers with the power to work quickly, efficiently and, above all, intuitively.

Heyman , Langley\nResearch Center\nA novel separation technique differentiates\nchemical species by their acoustic properties-absorption , scattering, and radiation\nstress. An ultrasonic transducer applies an\nacoustic wave to one end of a container\nholding species with differing absorption coefficients. The wave frequency is tuned to\nthe point of resonance of the species to be\nseparated, whereby it is moved toward one\nend of the container for removal. A second\ntransducer may be used to apply an oppo-\n\nsitely directed wave to prevent undesired\nstreaming. In addition, a radio frequency\nooupled with a magnetic field can help identify a species within a medium comprised of\nspecies with similar absorption coefficients.\nFor More Information Write In No. 553\nAlkali Metal Carbon Dioxide Electrochemical System for Energy Storage\nand/or Conversion of Carbon Dioxide\nto Oxygen\n(US Patent No. 5,213,908)\nInventor: Norman H.

"From the perspective\nof drug design, this is absolutely imperative because the virus has turned out\nto be much more complicated than was\nanticipated ," said Dr. Daniel Carter,\nleader of the Marshall research team .\n"In the end, it\'s probably going to come\ndown to understanding the detailed\ninteractions of these proteins at a molecular leveL"\nNASA\'s association with ABT began\nshortly after Marshall researchers determined the first structure of a human\n16\n\nmonoclo nal antibody that recognizes\nthe AIDS virus. The antibody, Fab 306,\nbinds to a\' coat protein in HIV -1 known\nas GP41.

These patterns, created as the atoms within\nthe crystal scatter the x-rays, are compiled and analyzed on a\ncomputer to assemble a model of the protein\'s molecular\narchitecture.\nSuccess depends upon the production of large, high-quality crystals of the proteins. Unfortunately, each protein presents a new challenge and unique solubility characteristics.\n"We grow them by screening literally thousands of different\nconditions-changing pH and precipitating agents to reduce\nsolubility, varying temperature, protein concentration, and\nother variables ," explained Carter, who received NASA\'s\n1990 Inventor of the Year award for using x-ray crystallography to solve the 3D structure of human serum albumin, the\nprincipal blood protein. "The result is a gigantic matrix and\nyou have no idea if or where the crystals are going to grow."\nMarshall\'s new 7500-square-foot Laboratory for Structural\nBiology, scheduled to open in November, will provide added\nwork space and computer graphics facilities for the massive\nundertaking . The new laboratory will support the group\'s\nmicrogravity research on the space shuttle, which also may\nbenefit the AIDS project. "The microgravity experiments\nassess quality differences between crystals grown at Og versus 19," explained Carter. "It\'s now well established that some\ncrystals grow better at Og. The likelihood is very high that\nmicrogravity will benefit the crystal growth of some of the\nAIDS-related proteins."\nCarter expects the research to have spinoffs in a variety of\nareas. "These other viruses [HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) cause cancer and I think future researchers will find that many specific\ntypes of cancers are caused by retroviruses-understanding\nhow to stop them is extremely important." Concurring is the\nNational Institutes of Health, which has called structural biology a "linchpin in US biotechnology research" providing critical\ninsights into molecular function that can speed the search for\nmeans to prevent or cure diseases. 0\nFor more information about the technologies described in this\narticle, contact Dr. Daniel Carter, Mail Stop ES-76, Marshall\nSpace Flight Center, AL 35812, Tel: 205-544-5492.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1993\n\nNew Product Ideas\nNew Product Ideas are just a few\nof the many innovations described in this issue of NASA\nTech Briefs and having promising commercial applications.\nEach is discussed further on the\nreferenced page in the appropri-\n\nate section in this issue.

Such grids are\nused to compute flows about bodies like\nairplanes that have complicated shapes.\nA flow field is divided into topologically\nsimpler blocks to simplify the computations, and a grid fitted to the body is then\ngenerated in each block. 3DPREP relieves\nthe user of some of the burden of collecting and formatting the many data that are\nneeded to specify blocks and grids, and\n\nprepares input data for NASA\'s 3DGRAPE\ngridijenerating computer program.\n3DPREP is a highly interactive graphical\npreprocessing program that is designed for\nuse on a powerful graphical scientific computer workstation. It is divided into three\nmain parts, each of which corresponds to\na principal graphical-and-alphanumerical\nFigure 1. This Two-Block Grid About an\nIsolated Wing was generated with the help\nof the 3DPREP computer program.\n\nFigure 2. The Display of the Dialog Entry Facility asks the user for data pertaining to the grid.

The first part, called the "dialog\nentry facility," is mainly for the benefit of\nthe novice user. It puts up a display like\nthat in Figure 2, in which the computer\nasks the user specific questions about the\ngrid to be generated. First, it asks for data\npertaining to the entire grid, then for data\n\xc2\xb7pertaining to the blocks, then for data pertaining to faces and sections of faces of\nthe blocks. A history of the dialog between\nthe user and the computer is maintained;\nthis history can be scrolled up or down.\nThe user can store or restart the dialog.\nErrors are trapped in a conversational manner. A context-sensitive " help" display is\navailable.\nThe second main part of 3DPREP is\ncalled the "graphical editing facility." A\nmore-experienced user can take advantage of this facility to enter data more\nrapidly than through the dialog entry facility, or a less-experienced user could move\nto this facility from the dialog entry facility\nto modify previously entered data. In addition to pictures of the grid like those\nshown in Figure 1, the display generated\nby this facility includes four panels - the\n\nfirst containing data on the entire grid; the\nsecond, third, and fourth containing data\non the current block, current face, and current section, respectively. Images of buttons, activated by a mouse, enable the\nuser to advance to " next" and " previous"\nblocks, faces, and sections. Other images\nof buttons enable the selection, entry, or\nmodification of a datum in a panel.\nWhere appropriate, selection of a datum\ncauses the appearance of a subpanel that\nrequests additional information or offers\na range of choices. Errors in the data thus\nentered are trapped, and panels that contain incomplete or erroneous data are\nmarked by small blinking red dots. A list\nof all such errors can be obtained. Help\nfacilities are available with each panel.\nDefault values are available wherever\nappropriate.\nThe third main part of 3DPREP is called\nthe "multiple-block facility." It offers a collection of generally useful capabilities or\n" utilities," including the following :\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It plots the fixed boundary faces of all the\nblocks.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It generates a "pop-up" panel display\n\ncalled "double point readout," wherein\none or two points are identified by block\nnumber(s), index value(s), Cartesian coordinates, and graphical display. If there are\ntwo points, the distance between them\nis also shown.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The "generate surface" utility enables the\nuser to specify a grid line and generate\na surface from it.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Data on surfaces can be entered from\nother sources and in other formats (e.g.,\nfrom other computer programs). Such\ndata can be used in full and can be\ntransposed (rows and columns can be\nexchanged).\nThis work was done by R. L Sorenson\nof Ames Research Center and K. M.\nMcCann of Sterling Zero One.

The\nMMS procedure was developed to satisfy\nthe need for an improved method of analyzing flow data obtained by two\xc2\xb7dimensionallaser anemometry in a low-aspectratio, transonic , axial-flow fan rotor in a\nturbomachine (see Figure 1).\nPreviously, two obstacles had impeded\nthe application of the computer-graphical\ntechniques to these data: one was insufficient resolution of the locations of the fan\nblades; the other was the relatively low\ndensity of measurement points in the flow\nfield. The MMS procedure removes both\nobstacles by enriching the set of measurement data - in effect, interpolating the\ndata to intermediate points to obtain finer\nresolution . The enriched data then conFigure 1.

FAST is a collection of\nseparate programs (modules) that run\nsimultaneously and help the user to examine the results of numerical and experimental simulations. The user can load data files, perform calculations on the data,\nview the results of these calculations ,\nconstruct scenes of three -dimension-\n\n30\n\nai-appearing graphical objects, and plot,\nanimate, and record the scenes.\nThe primary intended use of FAST is\ngraphical depiction of computed flows,\nbut FAST can also assist in the analysis\nof other types of data. FAST combines\nthe capabilities of such programs as\nPLOT3D, RIP, SURF, and GAS into one\nsoftware environment with modules that\nshare data. Sharing data among modules eliminates the drudgery of transferring data between programs. All the\nmodules in FAST have a consistent, highly interactive graphical user interface.\nMost commands are entered by pointing and clicking . The modular construction of FAST makes it flexible and extensible . The environment can be custom-\n\nconfigured, and new modules can be\ndeveloped and added as needed.\nThe following modules have been\ndeveloped for FAST: VIEWER , FILE 10,\nCALCULATOR, SURFER, TOPOLOGY,\nPLOTTER, TITLER, TRACER, ARCGRAPH,\nGO, SURFERU, SHOTET, and ISOLEVU . A utility is also included to facilitate\nthe inclusion of modules defined by the\nuser in the FAST environment. The VIEWER module is the central control for the\nFAST environment. From VIEWER , the\nuser can change attributes of objects,\ninteractively position objects in three-dimensional space, define and save scenes,\ncreate animations, spawn new FAST modules, add view windows, and save and\nexecute command scripts .\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1993\n\nThe FILE 10 module loads PLOT3Dtype grid, solution, Jacobian solution, and\nfunction files into the FAST environment.\nIt consists of several windows for loading files, displaying attributes, and deleting data from shared memory. ARCGRAPH loads and renders ARCGraph\nmetafiles in the FAST environment. This\nmodule enables the user to load, view,\nand set the attributes of an ARCGraph\nobject.\nThe CALCULATOR module attaches\nto loaded grid and solution data and enables the user to calculate a variety of\nscalar and vector functions by use of\nthese data. SURFER operates on the\ngrid data read in by the FILE 10 module\nand the scalar and vector fields generated by the CALCULATOR module. From\nthese data, SURFER can generate a wide\nvariety of grid surfaces . These surfaces\ncan be rendered as points, lines, vectors, and polygons . In addition, each\nsurface can be colored either by some\nconstant color specified by the user, or\nby scalar field values. Surfaces can also\nbe shaded. GO is used to compute gridquality measures on one-, two-, and threedimensional structured grids. Sixteen\nbase functions are intended to give users\nflexible means of testing the quality of\nany grid. These functions include gridcell volume and two- and three-dimen-\n\n~\n\nGeneral-Purpose\nGraphics-Library Program\nNASADIG provides\nflexibility for the creation\nof graphics with text.\nThe NASA Device Independent Graphics Ubrary (NASADIG) computer program\nis a general-purpose graphics-library program for use with many computer-basedengineering and management application\nprograms. NASADIG gives the user the\nopportunity to translate data into effective graphical displays for presentation .\nThis software offers many features that\nprovide the user with flexibility in creating\ngraphics. These include two- and threedimensional plotting , splines and polynomial interpolation, area blanking control, multiple log/linear axes, legends and\ntext control, cUNe-thickness control, and\nmultiple text fonts (18 regular, 4 bold) .\nNASADIG contains several groups of\nsubroutines. Included are subroutines for\ndefinition of axes and areas of plots; setup and display of text; area blanking; setup of style, interpolation, and plotting of\nlines; control of color shading and patterns; control of legends, blocks of text,\nand characters; initialization of devices;\nsetting of mixed alphabets ; and other\nNASA T""h Rri.,fs: Al lollSt 199\n\nsional measure of skewness, orthogonality, aspect ratio, and stretching.\nThe TOPOLOGY module takes a grid\nand a vector field as input and displays\nthe topology of the vector field . Vectorfield features displayed by TOPOLOGY\ninclude critical points and eigenvector\ntraces. PLOTTER attaches to grid and\nscalar field data and generates graphical objects, each of which contains a\nseries of two-dimensional line plots.\nTRACER is the module used to calculate and display particle paths once\nthe data have been loaded or calculated.\nTraces can be computed individually, or\na range of traces can be predefined and\ncomputed all at once.\nThe SURFERU, SHOTET, and ISOLEVU\nmodules are intended for use with unstructured grids. These are grids with\ntetrahedral cells. SURFERU is similar to\nthe SURFER module. The SHOTET module is used for looking at particular cells\nin a tetrahedral mesh. ISOLEVU is used\nfor displaying data off surfaces in such\nforms as isosurfaces, cutting planes,\ncylinders, and spheres.\nFinally, the TITlER enables creation of\ntitles for inclusion in scenes and animations with FAST Strings can be handled\nseparately, each having its own font, font\nsize, color, and style.\nFAST is written in ANSI compliant\n\nFORTRAN 77 and C language for use on\nSGI IRIS-series workstations running\nIRIX 3.3 or later. It requires a minimum of\n16 Mb of random-access memory for execution, although a capacity of 32 Mb is\npreferred. A minimum of 75 Mb of harddisk memory space is required .

A simple modification increases the width of the frequency band\nof such an antenna by a factor of two or\nmore while maintaining nearly the same\nthickness with only a very slight increase\nin the width or length of the antenna.\nA radiating microstrip-patch antenna\nconsists mostly of a thin rectangular metal\npatch on one surface of a dielectric plate\nwith a larger metal plate on the opposite\nsurface. Excitation is supplied to the microstrip patch via an electrical connection to\nthe center conductor of a coaxial transmission line, the outer conductor of which is\nconnected to the larger metal plate.\nThe modification consists in the addition of strips of very thin electrically resistive sheet material (see figure). The resistive material is located along the edges of\nthe patch to attenuate the high currents\nnear the edges and to cause the effects\nof the edges to be a smoother function of\n\nfrequency and, thus, to cause the resonance of the patch to be less sensitive to\nthe width of the patch. The result is an increase in the bandwidth of the basic microstrip-patch antenna. Although the example illustrated in the figure shows two\nresistive strips applied to a simple rectangular microstri~patch antenna, more-complicated microstri~patch antennas could\nalso be modified by the addition of various\nresistive strips to increase the bandwidths\nof transmission and reception of signals\nin various polarizations.\nThe bandwidth of a working model of the\nmodified antenna was found to be more\nthan twice that of a working model of the\nunmodified antenna. Optimum bandwidth\nperformance can be obtained by adjustment of the shapes, resistances, and locations of the resistive strips.\nThis work was done by Marion C. Bailey\nof Langley Research Center.

When the external synchronizing signal is lost (e.g., because of a malfunction in external circuitry or because\nof testing), this circuit provides a substitute\ntiming signal from a free-running internal\nrelaxation oscillator.\n2:1 Multiplexer\n\nRelaxation t - - - - - - - t A : Input\nOscillator\nOutput\n\nExternal\nSynchronizing\nSignal\n\nB Input\n\nS\n\n~[>u ~\nB\nD\n\nR2\n\nSignal\n\nt--o()\n\n/\n\nTo Synchronization\nInput Terminal of\nSwitching Power\nSupply\n\nThis Fail-Safe Synchronizer feeds the external synchronizing signal to the switching power\nsupply.

Other parts of\nU are contained in the relaxation oscillator. During normal operation, the external\nsynchronizing signal is buffered by UA\nand fed to the B input of the multiplexer;\nit is also buffered by Us and used to\ncharge capacitor C through Schottky diode\nD and current-limiting resistor R2. R3 is\nchosen large enough that (1) it bleeds the\ncharge off C with an acceptably long time\nconstant and (2) to minimize the voltage\ndrop in the resistive divider of R2 and R3,\nit is large with respect to R2 .\nHex inverter U has hysteresis inputs.\nDuring normal operation, C remains charged\nto a potential above the input high voltage\nof Uc \' which is thereby made to maintain\na low-output (logic 0) state at the S input\nof the multiplexer. In this logic 0 state, the\nmultiplexer passes the Signal from input\nport B (in this case, the buffered external\nsynchronizing signal) to its output port.\nNASA Tech Briefs.

These filters would\nbe particularly useful in obseNing astronomical bodies that exhibit wide temperature dynamic range. The reduction\nin the signal dynamic range (due to the\ntemperature extremes) could be accomplished by blocking the short -wavelength\nradiance by using low-pass metallic mesh\nfilters.\nThe concept of etched-metallic-film\nfilters is not new; what is new is the solution of the practical problems of design\nand fabrication of filters for the particular wavelength range. The most widely\nused form of metallic mesh filters consists of a regular two-dimensional array\nof either square holes in a thin metallic\nfilm (inductive mesh) or metal squares deposited on a suitable substrate (capacitive mesh) as shown in Figure 1. For\ntransmission, the inductive mesh behaves\nas a high-pass (low-wavelength) filter, and\nthe capacitive mesh behaves as a lowpass (high-wavelength) filter. The filters\nthat are being developed are of the capacitive form. While a single capacitive\nmesh structure already constitutes a lowpass filter, the performance can be improved (making the low-pass characteristic more square-like) by stacking two\nor more such filters.\nOne of the advantages of etched-metallic-film dichroic filters, whether inductive\nor capacitive, is design flexibility: whereas the frequency responses of opticaltype infrared filters depend primarily on\nthe properties of the filter materials, the\nfrequency responses of the etched-metallic-film filters depend primarily on the\ndimensions and shapes of the metallic\nelements and the gaps between them.\nIn the case of multiple-layer filters of this\ntype, the distances between layers are\nadditional design parameters that affect\nthe frequency responses .\nOther design parameters that afford\nless flexibility are the indices of refraction, absorption coefficients, and thicknesses of the dielectric layers that support the multilayer capacitive mesh films.\nBecause these parameters are not easily controllable, the search for the optimum dielectric material is a significant\npart of the design task.

Induction motors\nare known for simple, rugged construction;\nthe ability to sustain overloads for short\ntimes; and relatively light weight in comparison with permanent-magnet dc motors,\nwhich are used in small variable-speed and\nservodrives but are not suitable for scaling to larger power levels (> 25 kW). Until\nthe advent of field-oriented control , the\nneed for complicated control systems to\nvary the torques and speeds of induction\nmotors has inhibited the use of them in the\nintended new applications.\nA field-oriented control demonstration\nsystem has been developed for use with\na commercial three-phase, 400-Hz, 208-V,\n5-hp (3.7-kW) motor. These systems include\na resonant (for small size) power supply\noperating at 20 kHz. A pulse-populationmodulation subsystem selects individual\npulses of the 20-kHz single-phase waveform as needed to synthesize the three\nwaveforms of the appropriate lower (machine) frequency (e.g., 400 Hz) applied to\nthe three phase windings of the motor (see\nFigure 1). Electric actuation systems using\nthis technology are currently being built to\npeak powers of 70 kW. The amplitude of\nvoltage of the effective machine-frequency\nwaveform is determined by the momentary frequency (equivalently, population or\ntemporal density) of the pulses, while the\nmachine frequency is determined by the\nrate of repetition of the overall temporal\npattern of pulses. The system enables independent control of both voltage and\nfrequency.\nThe induction motor can be controlled\nin either a voltage- or a current-regulation\nmode. In the voltage-regulation mode, control is imposed directly by an external programmable controller. In the current mode,\nrotor-speed feedback information is used\nin a closed-loop control scheme. In this\nmode, a speed-control circuit adjusts the\ntorque command within microseconds.\nFor example, a maximum-torque-change\ncommand can be sent, causing the motor\nto reverse direction over the full speed\nrange very rapidly.\n\nAs shown in more detail in Figure 2, the\nspeed-control circuit board takes the speed\nfeedback information and generates the\ntorque-command current. This current and\nthe manually commanded flux current are\nprocessed by the remaining circuit boards\nto generate the desired phase-current-reference commands. These commands are\nthen sent to a regulator, which compares\nthe reference commands with feedback\ncurrents to produce an error signal. This\nerror is used to generate the gate-drive\nsignals for the pulse-population-modulation\nconverter.\nSubsequent efforts will be devoted to\nreduction of the size and complexity of the\ncontrol system. Of the options considered,\nthe use of a digital signal processor appears\nto represent the best approach because it\nenables the evaluation of various control\nalgorithms.\n\nVoltage\n\n20.kHz Power Waveform\n\nEffective Machine\xc2\xb7Frequency\nWaveform Represented by\nPulse\xc2\xb7Populat ion Modulation\nb-..:::::.= - - - - --\n\n---==--=-_Time\n\nFigure 1.

Until now, a gain of \'110 has been the\nmaximum attainable without loss of stability for a very stiff typical industrial robot\narm; that is, the maximum force that could\nbe applied to an operator\'s hand via a control handle was only one-tenth the force\nof contact (as measured by force and torque\nsensors on the robot) between the associated remote manipulator and the manipulated\nobject. With such a low gain , small differences between the actual and commanded positions of the manipulator could create\nundesirably large contact forces. For safety and reliability, larger gains are needed.\nPart of the reflected force in the improved scheme is proportional to the position error, which is the difference between\nthe actual position of the robot arm and\nthe position commanded by the operator.\nThis position-error force-reflection concept\nis combined with compliance control (described below) to enable the required high\ngain .\n\nOperator\' s\nCommand\n\nPosition of\nControl Handle\n\nCommanded\nRobot\nServosystem\nR(s)\n\nNotes: 1.

Outputs of force and torque sensors\non the robot are not used directly for force reflection, but for compliance control, while errors\nin position are used to generate reflected forces.\n\nCompliance control is implemented at\nthe robot (which can be remote from the\noperator\'s control station) by low-pass-filtering the outputs of force and/or torque\nsensors on the robot and using the filtered\nsignals to alter the operator\'s position and/\n\nor orientation command. The filtered force\nand/or torque feedback makes the robot\nhand behave as though , in each degree\nof freedom , a damped spring were in series\nwith the otherwise stiff, controlled-poSition\nmanipulator.\n\nCUSTOM ENCLOSURES\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION\nASSEMBLED FROM STANDARD COMPONENTS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Pre engineered construction system produces rigid frameworks\nusing aluminum extrusions and die cast corners .\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Complex enclosure shapes are achieved with over 50 different\nstock angled extrusions and matching castings.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Square and radius profiles in 1wo sizes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A wide selection of additional hardware.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Stock components for in-house assembly.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Pre-cut kit assemblies.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Complete design and fabrication.\n\nI\n\nCRYSTAL MARK, INC.\nCustom Enclosure Division\n1062 Fairview Drive, Carson City, NV 89701\n\nNO\nWELDING\nMITERING\nFORMING\n\nConsoles\nRacks\nTest Benches\nMachine Guarding\nPre-cut Kit Assemblies\nElectro-mechanical Enclosures\nTOLL FREE 1-800-788-7521 .

During normal, steady\noperation , fuel is sprayed downstream,\nand combustion takes place downstream\n\nA\')\n\nof the spray bar. Sometimes prolonged\nthermal stress causes the spray bar to\ncrack, allowing fuel to leak out upstream\nof the spray bar. The leaked fuel gives rise\nto abnormal upstream combustion, which\ncan cause serious damage to both the\nspray bar and the other equipment in the\ncombustion chamber. The acoustical leak-\n\ndetection system gives an early warning\nof failure , enabling the operating personnel to stop the combustion process\nand repair the spray bar before the leak\ngrows large enough to cause damage.\nThe figure is a simplified illustration\nof a combustion chamber and the acousticalleak-detection system . Prior ex-\n\nNA~A\n\nTprh Rril=lk\n\nAllnllct 100\'l\n\nperience shows that upstream combustion excites an acoustic standing wave\nin the fundamental mode of that portion\nof the chamber that lies between the fuel\ninjector and the exit end of the inner liner.\nIn the original combustion chamber for\nwhich this system was designed [an 8ft (2.4-m) high-temperature test chamber]. this mode has a frequency of 140\nHz. In normal operation , the acoustic\nspectrum includes only a small peak at\nthis frequency - slightly above the bac~\xc2\xad\nground noise with 30Hz being predominant (fundamental mode of entire chamber). When upstream combustion occurs,\nthis spectral peak becomes large.\nTo detect this characteristic acoustic\nemission, the acoustic transducer (a simple dynamic-pressure transducer) can be\np laced in the air-supply duct or in the\nnormally cool portion of the combustion\nchamber upstream of the spray bar. The\noutput of the transducer is narrow-bandpass-filtered at the characteristic frequency (140 Hz in the original application) ,\namplified , and rectified. The rectified signal is sent to a trigger circuit that activates the alarm when the signal exceeds a level indicative of a potentially\ndamaging fuel leak.\nThis simple acoustic-signal-detection\nconcept is also applicable to engines,\ngas turbines , furnaces , and other machines in which acoustic emissions at\n\nl}\'J\'J\\~U CASES FOR\n\nENSITIVE ELECTRONICS\n\nPositive .nt/\xc2\xb7I11", Iat:b.\n\nE/utotrlflrlc lIIock moun".\n\nPrevents lid separation from base\non impact.\n\nProvide controlled shock and\nvibration levels.

A substrate layer,\nin this case, Kapton\xc2\xae(or equivalent) polyimide provides electrical isolation but\nvery low thermal isolation. Substantial\nheat is lost to the model by conduction,\naffecting the frequency response and\nresolution of the sensor. A thicker sub-\n\nstrate would reduce thermal loss, but\nthe substrate must be made as thin as\npossible to minimize flow disturbances.\nIn one technique now used to compensate for this thermal loss, the entire model is heated by internal sources. However,\nthe temperature of the model changes\nmuch more slowly than do the temperatures of the hot-film sensors. Furthermore, the internal sources of heat consume a substantial amount of power, and\n\nthe installation of them necessitates extensive modification of the inside of the\nmodel.\nAn active hot-film-sensor/thermal-isolation system developed at NASA Langley Research Center provides thermal\nisolation from the model and retains the\nadvantage of low substrate thickness, so\nthat the sensor does not disturb the boundary layer significantly. The system, shown\nin the figure, consists of two hot-film sen-\n\nsors, one mounted directly on the other\nwith sensing areas vertically aligned. This\ntwo-sensor assembly is mounted on the\nsurface of the model. Each hot film consists of metal with a high temperature coefficient of electrical resistance; in this\ncase nickel, which is deposited or glued\non a highly electrically insulating substrate material like polyimide.\nThe outer (top in the figure) sensor detects changes in boundary-layer flow phenomena, and the inner (bottom in the figure) sensor actively thermally isolates the\ntop sensor from the model. The inner\nsensor is the active thermal-isolation sensor, which provides dynamic localized\nheating of the model and is operated\nwith the same response time as that of\nthe detection (outer or top) sensor. The\ninner hot-film sensor compensates for\nthermal properties of the model by providing heat at the rate needed to sustain\nthe thermal conduction, leaving the outer\nhot-film sensor free to respond to changes\nin flow, independently of thermal properties of the model.\nOne of the major benefits of this system is that the conductive transfer of heat\ncan be controlled with the same response\ntime as that of the hot-film sensor. Stated\nsomewhat differently, the thermal boundary condition can be controlled at the response time of the detection hot-film\nsensor, which is significantly less than\nthe response time of an internally heated model.\nIn comparison with an intemally heated model, this system requires less power to maintain the outer hot-film sensor\nat a given temperature, thus enabling the\n\nNickel Film\n(Resistance-vs.Temperature Material)\n\n}\n\nFloW-MeaSUrin g\nor Detection\nHot-Film Sensor\n\n~~"":""":""":""\'::""\':"~~:""\':"\'~.J>.....::""":""\'::""\':"~~:""\':"\'~ }\n\nActive-Thermal-\n\n~"""",,<,,",,<,,,,,-,~<",,,<,,,,,<,,,,,,,,",,,,"",,..\\-,<,,",,<,,,,,-,~<,,,,,<,,,,,,,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,.-t\n\nIsolation HotFilm Sensor\n\nTwo Hot-Film Sensors are stacked on a wind-tunnel model.

The method is used 10 detect and evaluate quantitatively the internal conditions of composite materials.\nSy use of IPS, one can evaluate the internal structure of a fiber composite and\ndetect such structural defects as those\ncaused by broken fibers, porosity, and\ninclusions. A serious problem, however,\noccurs in practice because the surface\ntexture of a typical composite produces\nreflected waves that cause incorrect,\nexcessive values of IPS.\nA method of removing or avoiding this\nsignal aberration should make IPS a\n\npractical technique for nondestructive\nevaluation (NDE) of composite-material\nparts that have cloth surface impressions. The method involves the recognition that the cloth impression on the surface of the composite causes a reflection\nthat is analogous to that from a diffraction\ngrating in optics. Depending upon the\nnature and thickness of a composite\npart, the polar backscattered signal may\ncontain the sum of several signals emanating from reflection- and refraction-type\ngratings caused by the surface. Empirically, in samples without surface impreSSions, the internal scattering components of the polar backscatter signals\nappear to behave approximately linearly.\nConversely, there are periodic peaks in\nthe frequency domain if there is a surface impression on either or both sides\n\nofa part.\nThe IPS data are recorded digitally and\nstored for off-line computer processing .\nFourier analysis of the total signal can be\nused to extract the periodicity constants\nrequired to quantify the unwanted reflected components. In this way, IPS, as\napplied to composites with surface texture, can be accurately computed by applying an appropriate filter function . In an\nalternate method, IPS would be computed with frequency components that\ndo not include the periodic peaks in the\nfrequency domain.\nThis method requires no preparation\nof the sample . It requires only a technique of acquisition of digital radio-frequency data, which method is rapidly becoming the standard means of acquisition\nof ultrasonic data in field installations.\n\nThe data are recorded in the time do main and stored off-line, so that the IPB\ncomputation can be performed after the\nscan has been finished, with little or no\neffect on the initial scan (data-acquisition) time or on the sample.\n\nThis work was done by Eric I.

In\nthe combustor for an 8\xc2\xb7ft (2.4-m) high\xc2\xb7\ntemperature tunnel for which the acoustic\nflameout detector was first designed, the\nexplosion could be large enough to cause\ndeath and injury as well as destruction of\nthe combustor and nearby equipment.\nPrior flameout detectors have based on\noptical and thermal detection principles.\nThe transducers in some of these detectors cannot give rel iable indications of\nflameout until the flame has traveled com\xc2\xb7\npletely out of the combustor. The transducers in others respond more rapidly, but\nthey also respond to phenomena that are\nnot unique to flameouts. All depend on\nelectronic logic circuitry to decide whether\nthe detected phenomenon is a flameout.\nThe delay in the logic circuitry adds significantly to the overall response time,\nwhich can be of the order of 1 second in\na typical case. In comparison , the acoustic\nflameout detector includes relatively sim\xc2\xb7\npie, fast decision circuits and responds\nmuch more rapidly to an easily detectable\nacoustic phenomenon that gives an unam\xc2\xb7\nbiguous indication of incipient flameout.\n\nMain Combustion Volume ~l\n\nf-o-+l-- Region I\nI\n\n/ 1/\n\nAir\n\nI II\n\\ \\ \\\n\\\n\nFuel\n\nHot\nGases\n\n,\n\n~ ~----------Air\n\nAcoustic Energy \\ \\ \\\n(Flowing From I I I\nAir to Flame) I / I\nI\nFlame\nHolder\n\nFigure 1.

The output of the\ntransducer is processed through a signal\nconditioner and a buffer amplifier, then\n\nA typical combustor (see Figure 1) includes a flameholder, which injects fuel into the combustion volume. Air or other\ngaseous oxidant is delivered through the\nvolume behind the flameholder , which is\nknown in the industry as the holdup or delivery volume. The combustion process\ngenerates acoustic waves in the holdup\nvolume; typically, the most pronounced of\nthese is the fundamental-mode standing\nwave of the holdup volume. This wave is\nalways excited during combustion, and the\nexcitation ceases the instant the flame\n\n40 ms--l\nDynamicPressure\nTransducer\n\nI----\n\nAmplifier\nor Other Signal\nConditioner\n\nInput\nBuffer\nAmplifier\n\nI\n\nHUlA\n\n"VvY\'\n\nI I\n\n---1 t-- 20 ms\nComparator\n\n~ hn\n\nMissing-Pulse\nDetector\n\nI--\n\nAA\\\nV\n\nBand-Pass Filter:\n25 % 10 Hz\n\n20 ms-.l\nPrecision\nFull-Wave\nRectifier\n\nI-\n\nl~\n\n~,\n\nOutput\nBuffer/Relay\n\n~\n\ni\n\nOutput to\nProgrammable\xc2\xb7\nLogic Controller\n\n~.J\n\nFigure 2. The Acoustic Flameout Detector contains relatively simple decision circuits, because the only decision it has to make is whether\nan acoustic wave in a specific frequency band is strong enough. If not, then flameout is about to occur, and the acoustic flameout detector\nsends a signal to turn off the supply of fuel.\n\nband-pass filtered at the frequency of the\nacoustic wave to be detected (25 \xc2\xb1\n10 Hz in the original application)_The output of the band-pass filter is full-wave rectified, then processed through a comparator, which puts out a pulse for each rectified\npeak above the preset threshold voltage.\nDuring normal combustion , there is one\npulse for each half period of the acoustic\nwave in question.\nThe pulses from the comparator are fed\nto a missing-pulse detector, which contains\nan internal timer that is reset by each pulse.\nIf, after the most recent pulse, no further\npulses are received within three half\n\nperiods (60 ms in the original application)\nplus a small additional delay of 3 ms, then\nthe missing-pulse detector sends a signal\nto an output buffer/relay. If the miSSingpulse detector sends this signal a second\ntime, then the output buffer/relay sends a\nsignal to a programmable-logic controller,\nwhich initiates closure of the fuel valve. The\noverall response time from the start of\nflameout to the generation of the valveclosure signal in the original application is.\nabout 120 ms. It takes abo\'jt 300 ms for\nall combustion products to leave the combustor. Thus, the acoustic flameout detector initiates a response to flameout\n\nabout 180 ms before flameout is complete.\nThis work was done by Richard L Puster,\nJohn M. Franke, James W. West, Edward\nE.

Diameter,\n2-in. Focal Length\n\nBand-Pass Filter\n(2.5 to 3.3 ,.,m)\n\n15 m).\nThe developmental detectors utilize a\npart of the infrared spectrum in which the\nsignals from hydrogen flames are 103 to\n104 times as intense as they are in the ultraviolet region of current detectors. Also,\none can utilize low-loss infrared lenses for\nfocusing and for limiting fields of view to\nscreen out spurious signals from nearby\nsources. As a result of this combination\nof signal-strengthening features, the new\ndetectors can operate at greater ranges;\nin principle, they should be able to detect\nhydrogen fires at distances of as much as\n100 m when fully developed.\nThe basic principle of detection is to exploit the unique infrared-emission spectrum of a hydrogen fire. This spectrum differs sharply from the infrared-emission\nspectra of sunlight (both direct and reflected), carbon-based flames, incandescent\nlamps, and other natural and artificial phenomena likely to be found in the vicinity\nof a hydrogen fire. Of these infrared\nsources, the hydrogen fire is the only one\nthat emits more power in the wavelength\nband from 2.8 to 3.2 p.m than in the wave\xc2\xb7\nlength band from 3.3 to 5.0 p.m. Thus, one\ncan use the ratio between measured\npowers in the two wavelength bands to\ndistinguish between hydrogen fires and\nother sources.\nA portable hydrogen-fire detector according to this concept (see figure) would in-\n\n,\\\nBand-Pass\nFilter\n(3.5 to 5.0 ,.,m)\n\nPhotodetectors\n\n\\ \\\nJI\n1/\n\nA Portable, Battery-Powered Unit would give an audible alarm, in the form of an increase\nin the frequency of a tone, when aimed at a hydrogen fire.\n\nclude CaF2 lenses, each of which would\nfocus infrared radiation from the source(s)\nin the field of view through a band-pass\nfilter onto a PbSe photodetector. One of\nthe filters would transmit at wavelengths\nof 2.5 to 3.3 p.m; the other, at 3.5 p.m and\nlonger (PbSe does not sense photons with\nwavelength greater than 5.0 p.m). The photodetectors would be connected in a\nbridge circuit, the imbalance of which\nwould be amplified, filtered, and used to\ndrive an audio-frequency voltage-controlled\noscillator.\nIn the absence of an infrared source,\nthe bridge would remain balanced and the\nunit would emit an audible tone at a middle frequency. When the detected radiation in the shorter-wavelength band ex\xc2\xb7\nceeded that in the longer-wavelength band,\nthe bridge would become unbalanced in\none direction, causing the frequency to in\xc2\xb7\n\ncrease and thereby alerting the user to the\npresence of a hydrogen fire in the field of\nview of the unit.\nIncidentally, a carbon-based flame emits\nmore power in the longer-wavelength band\nand could, therefore, be detected via a\nbridge imbalance in the other direction and\nthe consequent decrease in the audio frequency. A battery-powered prototype was\nconstructed and tested on a number of indoor and outdoor targets, including hydrogen and propane flames. As expected,\nthe audio frequency increased for the hydrogen flame and decreased for the propane flame.\nThis work was done by J.

Like other oil-film skin-friction meters, it is based on the following\nprinciple of operation : if an oil of known\nviscosity is injected onto a surface on\n\nwhich an aerodynamic boundary layer is\ndeveloping, then the measurement of the\nchange of its slope with time enables the\ncalculation of the wall shear stress or skin\nfriction at the site of the oil.\nThe oil-injection apparatus associated\nwith the internal-reflection oil-film skin-fricAerodynam ic\n\nFlow of Air\n\nThe Laser, Mirrors, and Photodiode Position Sensor are housed in a palm-sized unit that\ncan be attached readily under the aerodynamic surface.\n\ntion meter includes an oil reservoir, a small\non-demand pump, and a tube that leads\nto the surface over which the aerodynamic\nboundary layer is developing (see figure).\nThe oil-injection port is located about 1 cm\nupstream of the site where the skin friciion is to be measured. The skin-friction\nmeter includes a solid-state laser or other\nsmall source of light, a transparent window (about 10 mm in diameter) flush with\nthe surface, and a photodiode position sensor. The beam of light from the source is\nreflected internally from the inside of the\ntop I)f the oil film and falls onto the sensor .\nMultiple reflection with a cascade of mirrors can be used to augment the light arm\nand improve sensitivity. As the slope of the\noil film changes with time, the location of\nthe returned beam on the sensor also\nchanges. The output voltage of the sensor is recorded by an analog-to-digital converter and stored for processing and display of the value of the skin friction.\nThe skin-friction meter is contained in\na small, palm-sized housing , in which the\nsource of light, mirrors, and sensor are\nmounted rigid ly in alignment. The entire\nunit can be mounted rigidly under the skin\nof an aircraft or wind tunnel , eliminating\nany relative vibration between the optic.al\nelements and the skin of the aircraft or\nwind tunnel. The meter is primarily applicable to flight and wind-tunnel tests, but\nit could also be used in chemical-processing plants.\nThis work was done by Promode R.\nBandyopadhyay of Analytical Services &\nMaterials, Inc., and Leonard M.

If an Sn0 2surfaced polyimide film is to be used as\na free-standing film (i.e., released from\nthe glass plate or other rigid substrate\non which it is formed), then the semiconductive layer should be protected\nby a top coat of polyimide, deposited\nas a film from solution directly onto the\nSn02. The resultant films are flexible and\nresistant to both weather and high temperature. They can be used, for example, on aircraft to provide resistance to\nlightning strikes. They could also be used\nin microelectronics and flexible circuitry.\nThe production of a polyimide film with\na semiconductive Sn02 surface layer involves the following steps: (1) selection\nof a tin complex soluble in the solvent of\nchoice for the polyamic acid to be processed into the polyimide film; (2) preparation of the polyamic acid solution; (3)\naddition of the soluble tin complex with\nmixing until the solution is homogeneous; (4) spreading of the solution as a\nfilm; (5) thermal treatment to imidize the\npolymer, to induce migration of tin complex to the surface of the film, and to\nconvert the tin complex to inert, semiconductive Sn0 2. Steps 2 and 3 can be\ninterchanged: the tin complex can be\nfirst dissolved, and polymerization conducted in the presence of the complex.\nAs indicated schematically in the first\nreaction of Figure 1, the polyamic acid\nresin designated as PMDA/4,4\'-ODA was\nprepared by adding a solution of 14.08\ng (0.0645 moles) of pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) in dimethyl acetamide\n(DMAc) to a solution of 12.92 g (0.0645\nmoles) 4,4\'-oxydianiline (ODA) in DMAc.\nA solution of 5.04 g (0.0121 mole) of\nSnCI 4 (dimethylsulfoxide)2 in DMAc was\nadded to the polyamic acid resin solution, and the resulting mixture was\nstirred for a total of 16 h.

The polyamic\nacid film was then cured to the polyimide (the second reaction in the figure)\nin a forced air oven by heating for 20 min\nat a temperature of 60\xc2\xb0C, 10 min at\nBOoC, 60 min at 100\xc2\xb0C, 60 min at 200\xc2\xb0C,\nand finally 60 min at 300\xc2\xb0C. The resulting material was a clear brownish film\nwith a thickness of 1.4 mil (0.04 mm).\nThe surface of the film was semiconductive, with a measured conductivity\nof 1.07 x 10-2 n-2 ; the underside of the\nfilm was nonconductive, as was the bulk\nof the film . This material contained 5.20\npercent tin. Its softening temperature\nfTg) was found to be 321\xc2\xb0C. Its polymer\ndecomposition temperature was determined to be 534\xc2\xb0C (2 .5\xc2\xb0C/min, heating in air), indicating excellent thermal\nstability. The surface conductivity of the\nsemiconductive surface was unaffected\nby either the tape test (attaching and removing a piece of tape) or mild abrasion.\nThis indicated good adhesion of the surface conductive material to the polyimide substrate.\nFigure 2 schematically illustrates the\nreaction route for forming the protective polyimide coat over the semiconducting surface layer of Sn0 2 . When an\nexperimental coated film was removed\nfrom the glass plate on which it was\nformed, its conductivity was unaffected,\nas was its conductivity after it had been\nflexed several times at 180\xc2\xb0C in an effort to disrupt the continuity of the Sn0 2\nlayer. In contrast, when a semiconducting film without the protective coat was\nremoved from the glass plate on which\nit was formed , its surface conductivity\nwas reduced to less than 8.19 x 10-3 n-1.\nThis work was done by Anne K.\nStClair for Langley Research Center,\nStephen A.

The abstract language enables efficient description of\nlarge, complicated systems; a onepage ASSIST-language description can\nresult in a semi-Markov model with thousands of states and transitions. The\nASSIST program also implements model-reduction techniques to facilitate efficient modeling of large systems.\nInstead of listing the individual states\nof the Markov model, reliability engineers can specify the rules that govern\nthe behavior of a system, and these are\nused to generate the model automatically. ASSIST reads an input file that describes the failure behavior of a system\nin an abstract language and generates\na Markov model in the format needed\nfor input to SURE (the semi-Markov Unreliability Range Evaluator program) and\nPAWS/STEM (the Pade Approximation\nWith Scaling and Scaled Taylor Exponentia\x01 Matrix programs).\nA Markov model consists of a number of system states and transitions\nbetween them. Each state in the model\nrepresents a possible state of the system in terms of which components have\nfailed, which ones have been removed\nand the like. Within ASSIST, each stat~\nis defined by a state vector, where each\nelement of the vector takes on an integer value within a defined range. An\nelement can represent any meaningful\ncharacteristic , such as the number of\nworking components of one type in the\nsystem, or the number of faulty components of another type in use. Each\nstatement that represents a transition\nbetween states in the model comprises\nthree parts: a condition expression, a\ndestination expression, and a rate expression. The condition expression is a\nBoolean expression that describes the\nvalues of the state-space variables of\nthose states for which the transition is\nvalid . The destination expression defines the destination state of the transition in terms of the values of statespace variables . The rate expression\ndefines the distribution of elapsed time\nfor the transition .\nThe mathematical approach chosen\nto solve a reliability problem can vary\nwith the size and nature of the problem. Although different solution techniques are utilized on different programs,\nit is possible to have a common input\nlanguage. The Systems Validation Methods group at NASA Langley Research\nCenter has created a set of programs\nthat form the basis for a reliability-analysis workstation . The set of programs are\nthe SURE reliability-analysis program\n(COSMIC program LAR-13789, LAR14921); the ASSIST specification interNASA Tech Brief!=:.

FTC is used to calculate the\nprobability of the top event in a fault\ntree . PAWS/ STEM and SURE are programs that interpret the same SURE\nlanguage but utilize different methods\nof solution.

In just three years, this NASA-sponsored event has more than\ndoubled in size, making it the world\'s largest tech transfer conference. The goal of Technology 2003 is to "improve the U.S. economy and industrial competitiveness by transferring leading-edge technologies to new commercial markets," according to James R. Thompson, general conference chairman and executive vice president of\nOrbital Sciences Corp.\nThis year, three other events have joined forces with Technology 2003 in Anaheim for National Technology\nTransfer Week (Dec. 5-11) : the Test Technology Transfer Symposium (Dec. 6-9), sponsored by the International\nTest Evaluation Association and the American Society of Test Engineers, which will bring together the commercial ,\ngovernment, and academic communities to share ideas, methods, and technologies related to test engineering challenges of the 21st century; the Technology Transfer Society Annual Meeting (Dec. 6-7) , which will offer a dynamic\nforum dedicated to the pragmatic issues of making money in technology transfer; and "Capitalizing Spatial\nInformation Technology" (Dec. 6), a one-day symposium covering business and finance opportunities in GIS and\nremote sensing, sponsored by the American Society for Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing.\n\nTechnology 2003 symposia registrants can attend the sessions of any of these other conferences without additional charge. More information about each event will appear in the September issue of NASA Tech Briefs. If you\nhave immediate questions, please call Wendy Janiel at (800) 944-NASA.\n\nTechnology 2003 Symposia To Spotlight Dual-Use Technologies\nn addition to 80,000 square feet of exhibits showcasing licensable inventions and new products, Technology\n2003 will feature some 100 symposia presentations by top technologists focusing on government-developed innovations with strong commercial promise in manufacturing, computing , electronics, biotechnology, environmental\ntechnology, and other critical areas. Some highlights:\nResearchers at the Department of Energy\'s Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) have developed spray\nforming technology for producing near-net-shape solids and coatings of a variety of metals, polymers, and composite\nmaterials. The INEL technique , which combines novel spray nozzle design with advanced process control and online diagnostics of spray plume, offers unique opportunities for simplifying materials processing while improving\nproduct quality.\nAnatomy meets virtual reality: NASA\'s Johnson Space Center teamed up with the University of Texas to create a\nVirtual Visual Environment Display (VIVED) that provides a unique educational experience.

The microtubes can be fabricated from any material, including high-temperature materials such as quartz\nor ceramics, and have nearly universal application in areas as diverse as optics, mediCine, and microelectromechanical devices. They offer the opportunity to miniaturize (even to the nanoscale) existing products and devices and to\nfabricate products that previously were impossible to produce.\nHAZBOT III , a teleoperated mobile robot designed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will enable HAZMAT teams to\nlocate, identify, and mitigate hazardous material incidences without risking personnel. The robot also could aid in law\nenforcement and mining operations.\nA state-of-the-art Universal Signal Conditioning Amplifier (USCA) developed at NASA\'s Kennedy Space Center automatically configures itself for maximum accuracy (12 bits) and resolution (16 bits) , using the information stored in its\nnonvolatile memory. Designed for use with most types of transducers and data acquisition systems, the invention\ncan minimize setup times while improving system reliability and providing more accurate results.\nA space spinoff could help the environment: NASA\'s Lewis Research Center has developed a high-capacity ion\nexchange material (IEM) that removes toxic metals from contaminated water. The IEM can be made into many\nforms, such as thin films, coatings, pellets, and fibers, and therefore can be adapted to purify contaminated water\nwherever it is found - wastewater treatment systems, lakes, ponds, industrial plants, or homes.\n\nTo reserve your place at Technology 2003. fill out and mail\n(or fax) the registration form on page 1 S of this issue.\n\n9\n\nMechanics\n\nFinite-Difference Algorithms for Computing Sound Waves\nGoverning equations are considered as a matrix system,\nAmes Research Center, Moffett Field, California\nA method of computing the evolution\nof an acoustic field in multidimensional\nspace and in time involves any of a number of algorithms that can be derived from\nfinite-difference approximations of the\nfundamental differential equations of\nacoustics.

T6 recapitulate:\nThe noted article discussea the derivation of a series of compact, high-fidelity\nalgorithms, based on the concept of a\ndiscrete dispersion relation, to solve the\nfirst -order scalar convective wave equation.\nThe development of the present method begins with the matrix.vector formulation of the fundamental equations, which\ninvolve first -order partial derivatives of the\nprimitive variables (pressure and veloc-\n\nity) with respect to space and time . The\nparticular matrix formulation places time\nand the spatial coordinates on an equal\nfooting , so that governing equations can\nbe considered as a matrix system and\ntreated as a unit. The spatial and temporal discretizations are not treated separately as in other finite-difference methods but instead are treated together by\nlinking the spatial-grid interval and the\ntime step via a common scale factor\nthat is related to the speed of sound .\nThe discretization is performed by use\nof matrix exponential functions in a manner that is already well established in\nmethods for the solution of systems of\nlinear, constant-coefficient, ordinary differential equations. This approach to discretization is reminiscent of asymptotic\nexpansions in which the effect of a rapidly varying quantity (the phase) pre-\n\nPlate\n\n.-:\n\n~ ..\n\n\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7:::::~iitfif(ill?n?(ig~:~~\xc2\xb7. \xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7::\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\n\nt\n\n=3.79 ms\n\nt =9.87 ms\n\nPlate\n\nThe Diffraction of a Sound Wave by a\nPlate is illustrated by contours of constant interference pressure computed for\ntwo different times, t , after the time of\nincidence of the wave at the plate .

These algorithms are as computationally efficient\nas older second-order algorithms. Assuming that the matrix exponentials commute, very efficient splitting methods can\nbe used to track two-dimensional waves.\nThe method has been demonstrated\nby using it to compute one- and two-dimensional waves propagating and reflecting back and forth between simple\nboundaries. The ability of the method to\nsimulate more-complicated situations was\ndemonstrated by using it to simulate the\nshort-term diffraction of an incident, initially harmonic wave by a plate (see figure).\nThis work was done by Sanford Davis\nof Ames Research Center.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA simplified, lumped-parameter malhematical model of flow in a duct has proved useful in estimating quasi-steady\ninlet and outlet flows. The model is adequate to simulate important features of\ncompressible or incompressible flows\nthat include aspiration, shock losses (if\ncompressible), combustion, transfers of\nheat, and changes in phase (see figure). Furthermore, it can simulate flows\nin straight or twisted ducts with constant or varying cross sections. In comparison with a full three-dimensional ,\nfinite -difference model, this model requires much less computation and can\nbe matched with experimental data more\neasily.\nIn this lumped-parameter representation, the flow is characterized by the\nexit velocity, V; and by an experimentally determined pressure-loss coefficient,\nK, that summarizes the effects of all frictional losses as though they caused a\nchange in the cross-sectional area presented to an inviscid flow. Values of K are\n\n66\n\nWall of Duct\n\n/\n\n,\n\n10% H20\n\nDropout\n\n-\n\n183\xc2\xb0F -\n\nH2\nAir\nH20 Vapor\nN2\nH20 Liquid Drops\n\n300\xc2\xb0F\nIn this Example of Duct Flow with complicated thermal and chemical effects, unburned\nhydrogen from the exhaust of a rocket motor is mixed with aspirated air, water vapor,\nand very small water drops to make the resulting gas mixture nonexplosive . Once the\ntotal flow is estimated by the method described in the text , local conditions for combustion or explosion can be evaluated in more detail.\n\ndetermined from measurements of pressures and velocities in quasi-steady flow.\nOnce values of K are known from flows\nof test gases in a small-scale model\nduct, they can be used to compute flow\nin the corresponding full -scale duct because they are substantially indepen-\n\ndent of size and of variations in the gas\nmixture. This formulation provides a simpie equality between the entrance momentum and a fictitious inviscid version\nof the exhaust momentum. This simple equality can, in turn, be used to simplify the\niterative computation of flow conditions.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, AU\nQusl 1993\n\nThe total pressure loss (entrance loss\nThermostats about 4/1 ac tual ,,:e.\n\n+ friction loss + exit dynamic pressure)\nis given by (I + K) pV2/2 , where p is the\naverage or effective mass density of the\nfluid in the duct. Then if the duct has\nlength L, it can be shown that the acceleration of the flow is given by\n\ndV =\ndt\n\n2\n(1 K )(\\Leq _ V2)\n+\n2L\n\nwhere t = time and ~q is the equilibrium\nvelocity at which the exit dynamic pressure, pV2/2 , of quasi-steady flow equals\nthe static ambient atmospheric pressure. In effect, this differential equation\nstates that the transient velocity can be\nobtained as a perturbation of the quasisteady equilibrium velocity, which, in turn,\nhas been computed by iteration. The separation of the computation of transient\nand quasi -steady velocities simplifies\nenormously the problem of making the\niterative solution converge.\nThis work was done by Wayne E.\nSimon of Martin Marietta Corp. for Kennedy Space Center.

The idea that underlies the improved method is that once a\nshaft has been balanced, it should not be\nnecessary to disassemble the machinery\nandlor shaft completely and rebalance the\nshaft when replacing a rotor on the shaft.\nInstead, one balances the replacement\nrotor on the balancing arbor, then installs\nthe balanced rotor on the shaft.\nThe improved method prescribes the\nfollowing balancing process:\n1. Assemble the shaft to be balanced without the rotor, but with all of the associated rotational hardware and precise\nbearing spacers in place of bearings.\n2. Match-mark the assembled parts of the\nshaft and rotational hardware with respect to each other and to an analogous 0\xc2\xb0 rotational location.\n3. Mount the assembled parts on the balancing machine, and balance them to\nthe limit of accuracy of the balancing\nmachine, removing or adding material\nas necessary.\n4. Obtain an extra rotor (called the "checkout rotor"), which is to be used in balancing operations but not placed in service. Mount the checkout rotor on the\nbalanced, assembled shaft.\n5. Match-mark the checkout rotor with respect to the balanced, assembled shaft\nand the analogous 0\xc2\xb0 location.\n6. Mount the checkout-rotor-and-shaft assembly on the balancing machine, and\nbalance it to the limit of accuracy of the\nmachine, removing or adding material\nas necessary from the checkout-rotor.\n7. Remove the checkout rotor from the\nshaft.\n8. Remove the precise bearing spacers\nfrom the shaft.\n9. Install the precise bearing spacers onto the balancing arbor.\n10. Mount the checkout rotor onto the\narbor.\n11 . Match-mark the arbor with respect to\nthe checkout rotor and an analogous\n0\xc2\xb0 location.\n12. Mount the arbor-and-rotor assembly on\nthe balancing machine, and balance\nto the limit of accuracy, removing or\nadding material from the arbor. The\nbalancing arbor is now calibrated to the\nshaft. This procedure compensates for\nthe machining tolerances of the shaft\nand the balancing arbor.\n13. To prepare to balance a new rotor (to\nbe placed in service), mount this rotor\non the balanced arbor.\n14. Match-mark this rotor with respect to\nthe arbor and an analogous 0\xc2\xb0 location.\n15. Balance the rotor as part of the rotorand-arbor assembly to the limit of\naccuracy.\n\n16. Remove the balanced rotor from the\narbor.\n17. Install and align (according to the\nmatch-marked analogous 0\xc2\xb0 location)\nthe balanced rotor onto the shaft.\nIf a balancing arbor is not to be used,\nthen the balancing process can consist of\nsteps 1 through 8 only, and the rotor to be\nplaced in service is used instead of the\ncheckout rotor. Whatever variant of the procedure is employed, it is important to note\nthat some unbalance may remain and\ncause trouble in service. In that case, it\nis necessary to resort to field balancing.\n\nThis work was done by Vincent G.\nVerhoff of lewis Research Center.

The purpose of\nthis unit is to draw a vacuum on a reservoir of liquid hydrogen that has been\nproduced initially, by other associated\nequipment , at a temperature of 20 to 30\nK. The evaporation of hydrogen from the\nreservoir cools the hydrogen remaining\nin the reservoir, and the continued sublimation after freezing cools the reservoir further, down to 10 K. To obtain the\nquick cooldown required in many applications , the sorption unit must be capable of reducing the pressure of hydrogen from 8 atmospheres (0.81 MPa)\n(for liquid hydrogen at 30 K) to 1.9 torr\n(0.25 kPa); thereafter, the sorption unit\nmust be capable of absorbing the hydrogen that sublimes from the hydrogen ice as this ice absorbs heat from\nthe device being cooled to 10 K, while\nmaintaining the pressure below 1.9 torr.\n\n70\n\nIn designing a hydride sorption unit for\nthis purpose, it is necessary to overcome\ntwo major obstacles to rapid pumping at\nlow pressure. The first obstacle is that\nthe absorption of hydrogen in the hydride-forming metal powder is exothermic . If the heat of absorption is not re moved quickly, the temperature of the\nhydride bed increases, with a concomitant increase in the sorption pressure .\nThe other obstacle is the pressure drop\n(resistance to flow) through the hydride\nbed and through its filter. (The filter is\nnecessary to prevent the hydride-forming powder from migrating out of the\nsorption unit through the associated\nplumbing . Migration is caused partly by\nthe cyclic expansion and contraction of\nthe hydride-forming powder during absorption and desorption, respectively.)\nThe present hydride sorption unit features a large surface area and short conduction path for the rapid and efficient\n\ntransfer of heat from the hydride powder\nto the surroundings . The primary container of the sorption unit is a stainlesssteel tube that can be immersed in a\nwater bath or otherwise heat -sunk to disSipate the heat of absorption at room\ntemperature. The hydride-forming powder is ZrNi, and is retained in a gap only\nabout 0.050 in. (about 1.3 mm) thick between a stainless-steel filter and the inner surface of the stainless-steel tube.\nThis configuration also provides a short\nflow path and thus minimizes resistance\nto flow. Spacers (not shown in the figure)\nin the gap suppress the migration of the\npowder by keeping the powder in separate compartments .\nThis work was done by Steven Bard\nand Jack A. Jones of Caltech and\n\nRobert C. Bowman, Jr., and Robert S.\nDowling of Aerojet General Corp. for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, Circle 83 on the\nTSP Request Card.

Heretofore,\nwhen such a path has been generated by\nthe Unigraphics (or equivalent) computeraided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system , the orientation of\nthe weld puddle at the first and last points\nhas sometimes been incorrect, with the\nresult that the weld puddle can run off the\nworkpiece.\nThe misorientation occurs because of\nthe way in which the particular CAD/CAM\nsystem makes the welding robot move in\n\nReal\nStarting\nPoint\n\n4\n\ncoordination with the workpiece-position ing table to enable the welding torch to\nreach the end points. In this particular sys\xc2\xb7\ntem , to keep the weld puddle oriented so\nthat molten metal does not run out, one\nshould make the table (only) move while\nholding the torch still. In practice, one does\nthis by use of the dummy points. The incorporation of the dummy points is simple and requires only a few extra minutes\nof programming effort.\n\nTwo extra points are generated in the\ndesign - one before the real starting point\nand one after the real ending point (see\nfigure). Each dummy point must be located\nat least 0.1 in . (2.54 mm) away from its real\nend point. After the off-line-programming\nfile (the ".CLS" file in Unigraphics) is converted to a manufacturing file (a ". PAR "\nfile in Unigraphics), the extra points are\ndeleted.

The process does not\ninvolve the use of flammable or toxic solvents. The process can be used to remove\ncoats from a variety of materials, including\nplastics, ceramics, ferrous and nonferrous\nmetals, and composites. It adds no chemical-pollution problem to the problem of disposal of the residue of coating material.\nThe process consists of blasting solid\ncarbon dioxide (dry ice) pellets at the surface to be cleaned . The pellets sublime\non impact and pass into the atmosphere\nas carbon dioxide gas. The size, hardness,\nvelocity, and quantity of the pellets are adjusted to suit the coating material and the\nsubstrate .\nThe heart of the equipment needed to\neffect the process is a pelletizer, which\nconverts refrigerated liquid CO2 into the\n\npellets. Air-delivery eqUipment moves a\nstream of the pellets to a blasting .gun,\nwhere compressed air fires them at the\nsurface to be cleaned .\nWhen small parts are cleaned in humid\nair, the dry ice can chill them enough that\nmoisture condenses on them. They can\nsimply be wiped dry. Complexly shaped\nparts can be placed in a drying oven to\nprevent corrosion by condensed moisture.\nThe time saved by blast cleaning with\nCO 2 pellets is substantial : Where solvent\ncleaning requires 8 worker-hours, blast\ncleaning with CO 2 pellets can do the job\nin 1 hour or less.\nThis work was done by Jody Fody of\nThe Boeing Co. for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.

Facets can also be\nregarded as dimensions in a Cartesian\nclassification space. The scheme involves\n(1) specification of a set of properties of\neach component to be classified and\n(2) refinement of properties by specification of additional properties, by use of\nbinary relations of the form entity relation value . In such a relation, entity denotes either a component or a property.\nValue can denote a component, a property, or an atom (a name for which no\nfurther description is provided) . A relation is equivalent to a facet, and the value\nof the relation is equivalent to the position along that axis of the classification\nspace that is represented by the facet.\nThe scheme is implemented in software that includes two major parts : (1)\na searcher, which is a software system\nthat is used to discover software that\nmeets a given need; and (2) a retriever,\nwhich is a software component that retrieves all the files necessary to use a selected software component.\nThe searcher enables the user to find\nthe desired software without being required to answer an excessive number\nof questions and without presenting the\nuser with too many possible answers to\nanyone question. Although it guides an\ninexperienced user through the system,\nit lets an expert user forge ahead without artificial restriction .\nThe searcher displays appropriate questions and, when the user has selected a\nquestion, displays possible answers. Questions correspond to relations, and the set\nof answers to a given question corresponds to the set of values of the relation\nrepresented by that question. The user\nthus proceeds through a series of displays\nof questions and answers (see figure) .\nComponents and properties can be\narranged into hierarchies. Properties can\nalso possess other properties specified\nby relations ; that is, a relation of the form\nproperty relation property is permitted.\nThis allows the value parts of relations to\nbe classified, so that one may use the full\npower of the retrieval system to select\nthe appropriate value for a relation . The\nability to classify values enables a human classifier to balance the number of\nanswers against the number of questions. That is, the classifier may decrease\n\nthe number of possible answers presented, but doing so increases the number of questions presented when the user\nselects an answer that is a classification for a set of values .\nThe retriever goes to work when the\nuser has identified the desired software\ncomponent. In the simplest case , the data base of software components and the\nretriever reside in the same computer.\nAll the retriever has to do then is produce a list of the names of the files necessary to use the selected component.\n\nIn the more-general case, the data base\nof software components is distributed\nacross several computers that are not\nnecessarily near each other. In that case,\nthe retriever might use a file-transfer\nprotocol to fetch the various files from\ncomputers in a network or connected\nby modems and telephone lines.\nThis work was done by William V.\nSnyder of Caltech for NASA\' s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The optimum grid is\nfound by a conjugate-gradient procedure in which the grid\npoints are adjusted iteratively to minimize the penalty function.\nNot all penalty functions go to zero, even in ideal cases. In\npractice some measures could be satisfied more easily or\ndeemed more important, in which case those measures can\nbe weighted more heavily. For example, it is often necessary to\nweight the boundary cost function more heavily than the\nunevenness-of-distribution cost function to assure a high\ndegree of conformity of the grid to the physical boundary.\nThe method has been tested by applying it in some twoand three-dimensional boundaries, including a square, a trapezoid, a nonconvex quadrilateral, a circle, an airfoil , a cube, and\na cylinder. The figure shows some of the results from the trapezoid case, illustrating the tendency of the unevenness-of-distribution cost function to contract the grid away from the\nboundary and the consequent need to weight the boundary\ncost function more heavily.\nThis work was done by Daniel G.

The stimulator can be used in research to characterize the behavior of a nerve under various\nconditions of temperature, anesthesia,\nventilation, and prior damage to the nerve.\nIt can also be used clinically to assess\ndamage to a nerve from disease or accident and to monitor the response of the\nnerve during surgery.\nThe stimulator consists of three major\ncomponents connected in tandem: a miniature probe with a spherical tip, a transducer, and an actuator (see figure). The\nprobe applies force to a nerve, the transducer measures the force and sends a\nfeedback signal to control circuitry, and the\nactuator positions the force transducer\nand the probe. A separate box houses the\ncontrol circuits and panel. An operator\nuses the panel to select the operating\nmode and parameters from among the following options:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The unit can be set to apply a constant\nforce adjustable between 0 and 10 g\nweight (0 and 0.098 N) with a preCision of\n\xc2\xb10.05 g (4.9 x10 -4 N). The force can be\nof indefinite duration or applied as a pulse\nlasting 1, 10, 30, or 60 s.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The unit can be set to apply constant displacement adjustable from 0 to 0.25 mm\nwhile the applied force is measured.1>s in\nthe constant-force mode, the displacement can be applied indefinitely or as a\npulse.\nThe actuator contains a parallel-linkage\nmechanism with two movable platforms.\nThe probe of a displacement-measuring\ntransducer [a linear variable-differential\ntransformer (LVDT)] is mounted on one\nplatform. The coil of a linear motor is\nmounted on the other platform. The motor\nmoves the platform and the linkage, thereby moving the probe. The LVDT provides a\nfeedback signal to the control circuitry,\nwhich maintains the probe in a fixed position, if that mode has been selected by the\noperator.\nThe force transducer is a smaller version of the actuator parallel-linkage mechanism. Its body is attached to one of the\nmovable platforms of the actuator. The\nprobe is attached to one of the movable\nplatforms of the force transducer. Because\nit always operates in the self-nulling or\n78\n\nr-------l\n\nI\n\n~Actuator\n\n:\n\nI\n\nMagnet of\nUnear Motor\n\niF_~~\nI~~~~\n\nI\n\nProbe\n\n,\n~~~I\n\nI\n\n:~~~~~~\n\nJ\n\nL ______ _\n\nThe Force Transducer protrudes from side of the actuator of the nerve stimulator. The\nmagnet of the linear motor is at the top of the enclosure. The diagram shows details of the\nactuator and force-transducer linkages. The unit measures approximately 15 by 7 by 14 em\nand weighs less than 2 kg.\n\n"locked" mode, the force transducer puts\nout a signal indicative of the force that the\nprobe exerts against the nerve. The control\ncircuitry uses this signal to maintain a constant force between the probe and the\nnerve if that mode has been selected.\nThe probe is a spherical epoxy bead on\n\xc2\xb7the pointed end of a rod of 0.0625-mm di-\n\nameter. The rod is mounted vertically in an\narm of the force transducer.\nThis work was done by Ping Tcheng and\nFrank . H. Supplee, Jr. , of Langley Re\xc2\xb7\nsearch Center and Richard L.

Each model represents\na specific mechanism of failure . Once\nthe failure mechanisms and models relevant to a given ASIC are chosen, the adjustable parameters in the models are\nfitted to life-test data acquired from representative integrated-circuit structures\non test coupons that are fabricated along\nwith the ASIC\'s . Then the design parameters of the ASIC \'s are incorporated\ninto the models, and the models yield\nthe lifetimes.\nThis work was done by Martin G.\nBuehler, Nasser Zamani, and John A.\nZoutendyk of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropu lsion Laboratory.

Experimental and analytical data that are presented in the report indicate some general\ntrends in the failure behaviors of a class\nof composite-material structures that include (1) individual fuselage frames, (2)\nskeleton subfloors with stringers and floor\nbeams but without skin covering, and (3)\nsubfloors with skin added to the frame/\nstringer arrangement. Although the behaviors of these structures are complicated, a strong similarity in the static and dynamic failure behaviors of these structures\nis illustrated through photographs of the\nexperimental results and through data 0btained from mathematical models of generic composite-material structures. The\nsimilarity in behavior can give designers\nand dynamicists much information about\nwhat to expect in the crash behaviors of\nthese structures and can guide deSigners\nin improving the energy-absorption and\ncrash behaviors of such structures.\n\nThis work was done by Huey D.

Extremal dual control helps to prevent overtesting when the shaker operates at a\nresonant frequency of the article under\ntest, of the shaker, and/ or of the shaker-and-article assembly. For this purpose, it is necessary to choose the acceleration and force limits so that at the\nresonances, the various internal forces\nand accelerations of the coupled shaker and test-article structures remain below the desired limits.\nThis work was done by Terry D.\nScharton of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.
