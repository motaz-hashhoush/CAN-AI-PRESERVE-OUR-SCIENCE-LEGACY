An inflight demonstration was performed on the Apollo 14 mission during the translunar and and transearth coast periods. The apparatus consisted of an electrical heater, a heat sink device for cooling, and sealed metal capsules containing matrix materials having a low-melting point and dispersants. The evaluation of the demonstration samples was accomplished by comparing space processed (flight) samples with (control) samples processed on the ground under otherwise similar conditions. In the low q environment of space flight the dispersions of particles, fibers, and gases in a liquid metal matrix were maintained during solidification. Dispersions of normally immiscible liquids were also maintained during solidification.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720015848, "id": "e07e1573394c4c26ade673cede778ace", "publicationDate": "1971-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19720015848.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19720015848/downloads/19720015848.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19720015848/downloads/19720015848.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19720015848/downloads/19720015848.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
