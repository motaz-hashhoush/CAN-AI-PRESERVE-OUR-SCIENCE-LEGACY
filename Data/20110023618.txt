Mission impact; i.e., loss of function effect on other payloads or ISS operations may also be a characterization factor. For example, loss of the\nfunction of freezers and centrifuges may impact other payloads and increase the overall level of risk.\n2. The safety risk to crew inherent in the operation of a human-crewed vehicle may be a factor in payload classification determinations. Class C\nand D payloads that have a medium or high risk of not achieving mission success may be considered unsuitable for launch on a crewed vehicle,\nunless they are secondary payloads making use of available launch capacity that would otherwise go unused.\n3. Other situation-dependent payload classification considerations may include human-rating environment, logistics support, and interoperability\ninterfaces.\nOctober 19, 2011\n24\n\nJudith Bruner\n(Director)\nMaria So\n(Deputy Director)\nEric Isaac\n(Associate Director)\n\nGeorge Alcorn\n(Assistant Director for Tech Standards Excellence)\nJoe Wonsever\n(Chief Technical Assessments Engineer)\nPradeep Sinha\n(Assistant to the Director)\nJeanine Doherty\n(Administrative Officer)\n\nJesse Leitner\n(SMA Chief Engineer)\nInformation and Assurance Technology Services\nSanjeev Sharma\n(IT Manager)\n\nDirectorate Resources\nManagement Office\n(300.1)\nJane Langan\n(Directorate Resources Manager)\n\nSystem Review\nOffice (301)\nCarolyn Dent\n(Chief)\nRobert Savage\n(Deputy Chief)\n\nEEE Parts/Workmanship Group\nMichael Sampson\n(NASA EEE Parts Assurance Group Program Manager)\nJeannette Plante\n(Electronics Packaging Engineer)\n\nInstitutional Support\nOffice (302)\nVACANT\n(Acting Chief)\nDave Campbell\n(Deputy Chief)\n\nMission Support Division\n(320)\nVACANT\n(Chief)\nMike Kelly\n(Deputy Chief)\n\nSystems Safety\nBranch (321)\n\nReliability & Risk\nAnalysis Branch\n(322)\n\nBo Lewis\n(Branch Chief)\nOctober 19, 2011\n\nAnthony Diventi\n(Branch Chief)\n\nOccupational Safety &\nHealth Division (350)\nPatrick Hancock\n(Chief)\nVACANT\n(Deputy Chief)\n\nMission Assurance\nBranch (323)\nRob Sticka\n(Chief)\nJoe Hall\n(Associate Chief)\n\n25\n\nIncoming GIDEP\nDocument Process\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPer NPR and GPG requirements, an engineering review of\nthe following documents is performed: Alerts, Safe-Alerts,\nProblem Advisories, and Agency Action Notices.
