Phase 1 mirror system or component\ndeliverables would be accompanied by all necessary documentation, including the\noptical performance assessment and all data on processing and properties of its\nsubstrate materials.\nSuccessful proposals will demonstrate an ability to manufacture, test and control ultralow-cost optical systems that can meet flight requirements (including processing\nand infrastructure issues). Material behavior, process control, active and/or passive\noptical performance, and mounting/deploying issues should be resolved and\ndemonstrated.\n\nTechnical Need\nTo accomplish NASA\xe2\x80\x99s high-priority science requires low-cost, ultrastable, large-aperture, normal incidence mirrors with low mass-tocollecting area ratios.\nSpecifically needed for potential UVO missions are normal incidence\n4-meter (or larger) diameter 5 nm rms surface mirrors; and,\nactive/passive align/control of normal-incidence imaging systems to\nachieve < 500 nm diffraction limit (< 40 nm rms wavefront error,\nWFE) performance. Additionally, recent analysis indicates that an\nExoplanet mission, using an internal coronagraph, requires total\ntelescope wavefront stability of less than 10 pico-meters per 10\nminutes.\nSpecifically needed for potential IR/Far-IR missions are normal\nincidence 12-meter (or larger) diameter mirrors with cryodeformations < 100 nm rms.\nAlso needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict\noptical performance.\n\nMetrics\nIn all cases, the most important metric for an advanced optical system (after\nperformance) is affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of\ncollecting aperture). Current normal incidence space mirrors cost $4\nmillion to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This\nresearch effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5\nto 50 times, to less than $1M to $100K/m2.\nTechnology development is required to fabricate components and systems to\nachieve the following Metrics:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAreal Cost\nAreal Cost\nMonolithic:\nSegmented:\nWavefront Figure\nCryo-deformation\nSlope\nThermally Stable\nDynamic Stability\nActuator Resolution\n\n< $500k/m2\n< $100k/m2\n1 to 4 meters\n> 4 meters\n< 5 nm rms\n< 100 nm rms\n< 0.1 micro-radian\n< 10 pm/10 min\n< 10 pm\n< 1 nm rms\n\n(for UV/Optical\n(for Infrared)\n(total aperture)\n(for UV/Optical)\n(for Infrared)\n(for EUV)\n(for Coronagraphy)\n(for Coronagraphy)\n(for UV/Optical)\n\nOptical Components/Systems for potential UV/O missions\nPotential UV/Optical missions require 4 to 8 or 16 meter monolithic or\nsegmented primary mirrors with < 10 nm rms surface figures and < 10 pm\nper 10 min stabilty. Mirror areal density depends upon available launch\nvehicle capacities to Sun-Earth L2 (i.e. 15 kg/m2 for a 5 m fairing EELV\nvs. 60 kg/m2 for a 10 m fairing SLS). Regarding areal cost, it is necessary\nto keep the total cost of the primary mirror at or below $100M. Thus, an 8m class mirror (with 50 m2 of collecting area) should have an areal cost of\nless than $2M/m2. And, a 16-m class mirror (with 200 m2 of collecting\narea) should have an areal cost of less than $0.5M/m2.\nKey technologies to enable such a mirror include new and improved:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMirror substrate materials and/or architectural designs\nProcesses to rapidly fabricate and test UVO quality mirrors\nMechanisms and sensors to align segmented mirrors to < 1 nm rms precisions\nThermal control to reduce wavefront stability to < 10 pm rms per 10 min\nVibration isolation (> 140 db) to reduce phasing error to < 10 pm rms\n\nAlso needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical\nperformance via integrated opto-mechanical modeling.\n\nOptical Components/Systems for potential IR/Far-IR missions\nPotential Infrared and Far-IR missions require 12 m to 16 m to 24\nmeter class segmented primary mirrors with ~ 1 \xce\xbcm rms\nsurface figures which operates at < 10 K.\nThere are two primary challenges for such a mirror system:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Areal Cost of < $100K per m2.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cryogenic Figure Distortion < 100 nm rms\n\nFabricate, Test & Control Advanced Optical Systems\nWhile Sections 3.1 and 3.2 detail the capabilities need to enable\npotential future UVO and IR missions, it is important to note\nthat this capability is made possible by the technology to\nfabricate, test and control optical systems. Therefore, this subtopic also encourages proposals to develop such technology\nwhich will make a significant advance of a measurable metric.\n\nSelect:\n\nAdvanced Technology Telescope for\nBalloon and Sub-Orbital Missions\n\nAdvanced Technology Telescope for Balloon/Sub-Orbital\nMissions\nThis sub-topics purpose is to mature component level technologies (TRL4) to system level\ntechnologies (TRL6) by using them to manufacture complete telescope systems which\nwill fly on a high-altitude balloon or sub-orbital rocket mission.\nExamples of desired advances include, but are not limited to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReduce the areal cost of telescope by 2X to 4X such that larger collecting areas can be\nproduced for the same cost or current collecting areas can be produced for half the cost.\nReduce the areal density of telescopes by 2X to 4X such that the same aperture\ntelescopes have half the mass of current state of art telescope (less mass enables longer\nduration flights) for no increase in cost.\nImprove thermal/mechanical wavefront stability and/or pointing stability by 2X to 10X.\n\nMaturation will be demonstrated by building one or more complete telescope assemblies to\nbe flown on potential long duration balloon or sub-orbital rocket experiments.\nWhile proposals will be accepted for potential missions in any spectral range from x-rays to\nfar-infrared/sub-millimeter, this year\xe2\x80\x99s sub-topic is soliciting proposal specifically for:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUltra-Stable 1-meter Class UVOIR Telescope\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Exoplanet Mission Telescope\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Planetary Mission Telescope\nInfrared Interferometry Mission Telescope\nBalloon Gondola with Precision Pointing System\n\nInstructions to Proposers\nSuccessful proposals shall provide a credible plan to deliver for the allocated\nbudget a fully assembled and tested telescope assembly which can be\nintegrated into a potential balloon or sub-orbital mission to meet a highpriority NASA science objective. Successful proposals will demonstrate an\nunderstanding of how the engineering specifications of their telescope meet\nthe performance requirements and operational constraints of a potential\nballoon or sub-orbital rocket science mission.\nPhase-1 delivery shall be a reviewed preliminary design and manufacturing\nplan which demonstrates feasibility. While detailed analysis will be\nconducted in Phase 2, the preliminary design should address how optical,\nmechanical (static and dynamic) and thermal designs and performance\nanalysis will be done to show compliance with all requirements. Past\nexperience or technology demonstrations which support the design and\nmanufacturing plans will be given appropriate weight in the evaluation.\nPlease note: all offerors are highly encouraged to team with a potential user\nfor their telescope and include that individual in their proposal as a science\nmission co-investigator.\n\nTechnical Challenge\nScientists continue to develop new, more sophisticated experiments for\nflight on high-altitude balloons and sub-orbital rockets.\nThese require large, light weight, low cost optics, with well-behaved\nproperties over a wide temperature range.\nThere are currently several options, including glass, aluminum, and\ncarbon fiber. Each of these has both advantages and disadvantages.\nAll of the above have been used for balloon experiments, but increasing\naperture sizes, and the need for multiple large optics for\ninterferometers, is driving up the total cost of optics, such that ~1020% of a new balloon budget can be spent on optics.\nThus, new low cost methods or materials are needed.\n\nUltra-Stable 1m Class UVOIR Telescopes\n1-m class balloon-borne telescopes have flown successfully, however, the cost of such telescopes can\nexceed $6M, and the weight of these telescopes limits the scientific payload and duration of the\nballoon mission.\nA 4X reduction in cost and mass would enable missions which today are not feasible.\n3.1.1\n\nExoplanet Mission Telescope\n\nA potential exoplanet mission seeks a 1-m class wide-field telescope with diffraction-limited\nperformance in the visible and a field of view > 0.5 degree. The telescope will operate over a\ntemperature range of +10 to -70 C at an altitude of 35 km. It must survive temperatures as low as 80 C during ascent. The telescope should weigh less than 150 kg and is required to maintain\ndiffraction-limited performance over: a) the entire temperature range, b) pitch range from 25 to 55\ndegrees elevation, c) azimuth range of 0 to 360 degrees, and d) roll range of \xe2\x80\x9310 to +10 degrees.\nThe telescope will be used in conjunction with an existing high-performance pointing stabilization\nsystem.\n3.1.2\n\nPlanetary Mission Telescope\n\nA potential planetary balloon mission requires an optical telescope system with at least 1-meter aperture\nfor UV, visible, near- and mid-IR imaging and multi/hyperspectral imaging.\n\nInfrared Interferometry Mission Telescope\nA balloon-borne interferometry mission requires 0.5 meter class\ntelescopes with siderostat steering flat mirror. There are\nseveral technologies which can be used for production of\nmirrors for balloon projects (aluminum, carbon fiber, glass,\netc.), but they are high mass and high cost.\n\nBalloon Gondola with Precision Pointing System\nA potential exoplanet mission seeks a gondola that can interface\nwith a stratospheric balloon (such as one provided by CSBF).\nThe gondola shall be able to operate for at least 24hrs at a float\naltitude of at least 35Km; and 3-5hrs during the ascent from\nground to altitude.\nIt must be able to point a 1 m class telescope (including back end\noptics and with a mass of 150kg) at a specific target and\nstabilize it along its three axes to 2 arc-seconds or better on\neach axis (1 sigma). The pointing accuracy shall be 1/2 deg or\nbetter during the day and 1 arc minute or better during the\nnight (1 sigma). The required pitch range of motion is 25 to\n55 deg elevation, the azimuth range of is 0 to 360 deg, and the\nroll range of motion is \xe2\x80\x9310 to +10 deg.\nThe gondola maximum weight shall be 700 kg or less.\n\nAny Questions?\n\n'
