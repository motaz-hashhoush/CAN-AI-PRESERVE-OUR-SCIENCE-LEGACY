These tasks support the GSD goal of developing a secure, inexpensive data, voice, and video mission communications capability between remote payload investigators and the NASA payload operations team in the International Space Station (ISS) era. AZTek has provided feedback from the NASA payload community by utilizing its extensive payload development and operations experience to test and evaluate remote payload operations systems. AZTek has focused on use of the \"public Internet\" and inexpensive, Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Internet-based tools that would most benefit \"small\" (e.g., $2 Million or less) payloads and small developers without permanent remote operations facilities. Such projects have limited budgets to support installation and development of high-speed dedicated communications links and high-end, custom ground support equipment and software. The primary conclusions of the study are as follows: (1) The trend of using Internet technology for \"live\" collaborative applications such as telescience will continue. The GSD-developed data and voice capabilities continued to work well over the \"public\" Internet during this period. 2. Transmitting multiple voice streams from a voice-conferencing server to a client PC to be mixed and played on the PC is feasible. 3. There are two classes of voice vendors in the market: - Large traditional phone equipment vendors pursuing integration of PSTN with Internet, and Small Internet startups.The key to selecting a vendor will be to find a company sufficiently large and established to provide a base voice-conferencing software product line for the next several years.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000004137, "id": "6a00d658f9764f869492f89c2456fce2", "publicationDate": "1999-11-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000004137.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000004137/downloads/20000004137.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000004137/downloads/20000004137.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000004137/downloads/20000004137.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
