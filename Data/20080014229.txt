Thus, the amount emitted is a good metric\nto compare with other well-mixed GHGs. A similar argument has been used to justify\nusing an inventory approach in formulating policy on local air quality. Such an approach\nis appropriate as long as one is certain that processes in the hot engine exhaust plume do\nnot change the nature of the emitted gases. However, as one attempts to compare\ndifferent impacts, climate change versus local air quality for example, one would have to\nexamine the actual environmental impacts and derive a common currency for trade-offs.\nThe purpose of this report is to present the scientific consensus concerning the\nunderstanding of the environmental impacts from engine emissions. Thus, the emphasis\nis not on \xe2\x80\x98cutting edge\xe2\x80\x99 scientific research. Two major themes are discussed: local\nimpacts associated with emission associated with operation in airports including landing\nand take-off (LTO emissions); and global impacts associated with non-LTO emissions\n3000 ft above the ground. Studies (see e.g., Tarrason et al., 2004) indicate that non-LTO\n\nemissions at cruise have only modest impacts on local air quality compared to local\nsources, and that emissions around specific airports do not affect global concentrations.\nThis allows a partial decoupling of the two issues. In addition, the two issues call for\ndifferent approaches. Processes that effect changes to contrail, cirrus cloud, and upper\ntropospheric ozone associated with aviation emissions at cruise altitudes are unique to\naviation. Here, the scientific interest coincides with the need of the aviation industry. In\ncontrast, aviation emissions are one of many land-based sources that contribute to local\nair quality. Here, the scientific interests are not focused on the priorities of the aviation\ncommunity. The aviation industry must make use of the work within the wider\ncommunity to solve their specific problems.\nTwo other issues that would enter into the trade-off discussions will not be\ndiscussed in this report. Firstly, Regional air quality impacts are not discussed here as\nthere are few sources to draw from. The effects of LTO and non-LTO emissions on\nregional air quality are only beginning to be explored. For PM especially, inventory\ndevelopment is in its infancy, and questions of specific HAP emissions are poorly\nunderstood. Secondly, noise associated with airport operation will not be covered in this\nreview.\n\nScience Overview\nThe LTTG Technology Review Meeting\nMarch 2006\n\nSummary Report\n\nPrepared by\nClaus Br\xc3\xbcning 1*\nMalcolm Ko 2*\nDavid Lee 3\nRichard Miake-Lye 4*\n\nEuropean Commission, DG Research, Environment and Sustainable Development\nProgram, , Brussels, BELGIUM\n2\nNASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, USA\n3\nCentre for Air Transport and the Environment, Manchester Metropolitan University,\nManchester, UK\n4\nCenter for Aero-Thermodynamics, Aerodyne Research, Inc., Billerica, MA, USA\n1\n\n*\n\nResearch Focal Points for CAEP\n\nSummary\n\nThis report presents an overview of the latest scientific consensus understanding\nof the effect of aviation emissions on the atmosphere for both local air quality and\nclimate change in order to provide a contextual framework for raising future questions to\nhelp assess the environmental benefits of technology goals.

The scientific community will continue to provide\nguidelines on trade-off among different contributors to a specific environmental impact,\nsuch as global climate, or local air quality.

Introduction\nThis report presents an overview of the latest scientific consensus understanding\nof the effect of aviation emissions on the atmosphere for both local air quality and\nclimate change in order to provide a contextual framework for raising future questions to\nhelp assess the environmental benefits of technology goals. The questions may take the\nform of what are the environmental benefits that would result if goals were achieved,\nwhat are the consequences for other aviation pollutants, and whether tools exist to\nevaluate the trade-off? Since the Panel\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on reduction of NOx, the particular\nemphasis of this briefing paper is on the impacts of ozone (O3) from aviation NOx (NOx=\nNO+NO2) emissions in the contexts of climate change and local air quality. Emissions of\nNOx, particularly at cruise altitudes, lead to formation of O3, a \xe2\x80\x98greenhouse\xe2\x80\x99 gas and small\nreductions in methane (CH4, another greenhouse gas). In terms of local air quality, the\ndriver is primarily human health impacts from particles, O3 and NO2 (a particular issue in\nEurope); local regulations differ in this respect. With everything else being the same, an\nengine design with a smaller NOx emission index (defined as g of NOx emitted per Kg of\nfuel use) would deposit less NOx in the atmosphere resulting in smaller impacts.\nHowever, it is necessary to consider all emissions/effects of aviation since there are\npotentially both atmospheric and technological \xe2\x80\x98tradeoffs\xe2\x80\x99. In particular, there is the wellknown technological tradeoff between NOx emissions and fuel efficiency, since current\ntechnology trends for fuel efficiency tend to result in greater challenges for combustion\nengineers in designing low-NOx engines. Depending on the exact magnitudes, a less\nefficient engine with a smaller emission index may deposit more NOx in the atmosphere.\nTo facilitate studies on trade-offs among environmental impacts from aviation,\none must start with scientific investigations that quantify the impacts. A second step is to\nselect representative metrics with policy relevance so that diverse impacts can be put on\nthe same common scale. Within the context of CAEP, step 1 is aligned with the\nresponsibilities of the Research Focal Points, while step 2 is more related to activities of\nFESG. The IPCC Special Report on Aviation (IPCC, 1999) serves as an excellent\nexample of the first step. IPCC\xe2\x80\x99s Working Group 1, whose mandate is to provide the\nassessment of the scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change, produced\nthe report. An example of the second step is Wit et al. (2005), a study that was\ncommissioned by the Environment DG of the European Commission to scope out the\npossibilities for incorporating CO2 and non-CO2 effects into the European Emission\nTrading scheme. These steps are likely to be iterative as proposed policy options will\nraise new science questions, and new science will expand or limit policy options. Past\nexperiences show that clearly defined policy-related scientific needs will help focus the\nscientific community to marshal their intellects to provide the needed answers.\nWithin the first step, there are three sub-steps: quantifying the emissions, the\nchanges in ambient concentrations, the actual environmental impacts (i.e. radiative\nforcing or some other environmental response such as change in surface temperature or\nimpact upon human health), and the corresponding uncertainties. The relationship\nbetween some aviation emissions and changes in concentrations (in particular surface O3,\nand, to a lesser extent, global O3, CH4, and CO2) depends on the magnitudes of emissions\n\np. 1\n\nfrom other (non-aviation) sources. This is why one must consider aviation emissions in\nthe context of other emissions that affect the atmospheric budget of the pollutant. It\nshould be noted that one does not always need information from all three sub-steps to\nformulate effective policy. In the case of CO2, for example, the environmental impact as\na well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) is independent of the geographical locations of\nemission. Thus, the amount emitted is a good metric to compare with other well-mixed\nGHGs, once an \xe2\x80\x98equality\xe2\x80\x99 metric such as global warming potential (GWP) has been\nadopted. A similar argument has been used to justify using an inventory approach in\nformulating policy on local air quality. Such an approach is appropriate as long as one is\ncertain that processes in the hot engine exhaust plume do not change the nature of the\nemitted gases. However, as one attempts to compare different impacts, climate change\nversus local air quality for example, one would have to examine the actual environmental\nimpacts and derive a common currency for trade-offs.\nThe purpose of this report is to present the scientific consensus concerning the\nunderstanding of the environmental impacts from aircraft engine emissions. Thus, the\nemphasis is not on \xe2\x80\x98cutting edge\xe2\x80\x99 scientific research. Some of the developing science\nwill be discussed in separate presentations at this meeting. Two major themes are\ndiscussed: local impacts associated with emission associated with operation in airports\nincluding landing and take-off (LTO emissions); and global impacts associated with nonLTO emissions 3000 ft above the ground. It is likely that non-LTO emissions at cruise\nhave only modest impacts on local air quality compared to local sources, and that\nemissions around specific airports do not affect global concentrations (Tarrason et al.,\n2004). This allows a partial decoupling of the two issues, which supports the case for\ndifferent metrics. This also reflects the reality of the situation where the two issues are\nstudied by two distinct communities of practitioners. In addition, the two issues call for\ndifferent approaches. Emissions at cruise altitudes have a different impact on\nconcentrations in the upper troposphere compared to the same amount emitted at the\nground, which depends on physical (e.g. washout, dry deposition) and chemical\nprocesses/regimes. In studying the effects from non-LTO emissions, the scientific interest\ncoincides with the need of the aviation industry to quantify the importance of these\neffects in order to advise technology and policy development. In contrast, aviation\nemissions at the ground are one of many land-based sources that degrade local air quality.\nHere, the scientific interests are not focused on the priorities of the aviation community.\nOne must leverage the work within the wider community to solve aviation specific\nproblems.\nAssessing the trade-offs in reducing different emissions relies on an\nunderstanding of the impacts of the emissions and on the costs and benefits associated\nwith their reduction. The impacts and their uncertainties are being addressed in the\nscientific work summarized in this report. For some emission impacts, large uncertainties\nexist at present. For instance, the effects of LTO and non-LTO emissions on regional air\nquality are only beginning to be explored. For PM (particulate matter) especially,\ninventory development is in its infancy, and questions of specific HAP (hazardous air\npollutants) emissions are poorly understood. In addition, trade-offs would likely involve\n\np. 2\n\nenvironmental effects beyond emissions, such as noise, which is not being covered in this\nreview.\n2. Impacts on global climate from cruise emissions\nPresent commercial subsonic aircraft operate at cruise altitudes between 8-13 km\n(in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere), where they release gases and PM, thereby\naltering the atmospheric composition and changing the energy balance of the atmosphereearth system. Primary emissions from aircraft include CO2, water vapor (H2O), NOx,\nsulphur oxides (SOx), soot and unburned hydrocarbons (UHCs). These emissions lead to\nchanges in ambient concentration of the emitted species (e.g. CO2), and indirectly to\nchanges in concentrations of other species through photochemical interactions (changes\nin concentration of O3 and CH4 as a result of NOx emissions). In addition, aircraft cause\ncontrails under certain environmental conditions that may, in turn, enhance cirrus\ncloudiness.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) is the premier\ninternational organization that provides consensus policy-relevant scientific information\nfor defining mitigation processes for global climate issues. In the IPCC process, peerreviewed results from top research groups are compared and reported, and opinions from\nan expert panel are offered. An individual chapter usually involves many authors, and\ncontributing authors and is twice reviewed by a wider scientific base, and finally by\ngovernment representatives. The IPCC reports use radiative forcing (RF) to compare the\nclimate impact of the different gases and particles. RF (here measured in milli Watts per\nsquare meter, mWm-2) expresses an instantaneous change in the energy balance of the\nearth-atmospheric system resulting from a perturbation in concentrations of GHGs in the\natmosphere. A sustained positive radiative forcing imposes a warming effect, a negative\nforcing a cooling one. Carbon dioxide is the most important well-mixed GHG because of\nthe large quantities released and the long residence time of this gas in the atmosphere. Its\nRF is well known. Well-mixed GHGs have long residence times (~ several decades or\nlonger). The long residence time in the atmosphere means that the changes in\nconcentrations are independent of where the gas is emitted, and once emitted, the forcing\nwill persist for decades or centuries even if emissions were to cease and the temperature\neffect persists even longer. For these long-lived GHGs, the steady state temperature\nchange for a sustained forcing is expected to be proportional to the RF, with\napproximately the same proportionality constant for all GHGs. Current trading policy for\nlong-lived GHGs is based on GWP weighting with an integration time horizon of 100\nyears (GWP-100 weighted), which gives the equivalence mass of CO2 that will have the\nsame cumulative forcing 100 years following emission.\nIPCC acknowledges that there are much larger uncertainties associated with\nevaluating the climate impacts from short-lived gases. Once emitted, they typically\nremain in the atmosphere for less than a year. In addition, the spatial pattern of the\nchange depends on where and when the emissions occur. For example, because only a\nsmall fraction of the NOx emitted at the ground is transported to the upper troposphere,\nNOx emitted at cruise altitudes has a much larger impact on ozone in the upper\n\np. 3\n\ntroposphere than the same amount emitted at ground level. Changes in concentrations\nwill also be the largest near flight routes and therefore have a more regional effect on\nclimate. It is unclear whether the global averaged temperature response to the global\naveraged forcing will bear the same relationship as the long-lived GHGs. For these\nreasons, there are conceptual difficulties in using a GWP for NOx/O3 as the chemical (and\nthus RF) effect varies in space (location, altitude). Finally, using a 100 year integrated\neffect approach would artificially minimize the short-term impacts because the effect\nreally occurs only in the first couple of years.\nEmission inventories for aviation emissions at cruise are made using fuel use and\nemission indices (g of pollutants emitted per Kg of fuel use). The impact of aviation on\nclimate has been analyzed by IPCC Special Report on Aviation (IPCC, 1999) and the\nissues were revisited briefly in the IPCC\xe2\x80\x99 Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001). As\nexplained above, CO2 emitted by aircraft at cruise altitudes has the same effect as CO2\nemitted by a source at ground level. Fuel use for aviation in 1992 was 2% of all\ncombustion sources, and 13% of the transport sector.\nFor the following short-lived species, the RF will depend on the location of\nemission (flight path) in addition to the total fuel use:\nWater vapor released into the free troposphere by aircraft has little effect on RF because\nof the copious amount of water already in this part of the atmosphere. However, water\nvapor (and PM) emitted into the upper (cold) regions of the troposphere often triggers the\nformation of line shaped contrails, which tend to warm the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. Persistent\ncontrails may also disperse to form (optically thin) cirrus clouds (called contrail cirrus),\nwhich could have an additional warming effect. The direct RF of H2O and the RF of\nlinear contrails (for a given contrail coverage) is fairly well known, however, the RF\nassociated with contrail cirrus is highly uncertain. In addition, prediction of contrail\ncoverage and cirrus remain a challenge. The residence times of water and contrail in the\nupper troposphere are of the order of days, and hours respectively.\nSulphate and soot aerosols have a much smaller direct forcing effect compared with\nother aircraft emissions. Soot absorbs heat and has a warming effect; sulphate reflects\nradiation and has a small cooling effect. In addition, accumulation of sulphate and soot\naerosols might influence the formation and the radiative properties of clouds. Direct RFs\nare fairly well known; however, indirect RF through changing cloud properties is highly\nuncertain. Addition uncertainties come from the emission indices of soot.\nNitrogen oxides, though not in themselves GHGs, produce an indirect radiative forcing\nby changing O3 and CH4 concentrations in the atmosphere. Nitrogen oxides are\nchemically reactive gases, which produce O3 under the influence of sunlight. As a\nconsequence of complex tropospheric chemistry, NOx, will also reduce the ambient\natmospheric concentration of CH4. The RFs of O3 and CH4 are fairly well known, of\nsimilar magnitude but opposite sign.\n\np. 4\n\nTable 1 summarizes estimates of instantaneous RF and the uncertainties from changes in\nconcentrations from historical aircraft emissions reported by IPCC (1999). A recent study\nby Sausen et al. (2005) showed that the magnitude of the O3 and CH4 responses are 25%\nand 50% smaller. The results for soot and contrails are factor of 1.6 and 3 smaller\nrespectively. These values are consistent with the uncertainty estimates provided in the\nIPCC report. Finally, the values given in the Table should NOT be used to compare\nforcing in trade-off studies for two reasons. First, the numbers are RF associated with the\nchanges in concentrations associated with cumulative emissions from the historical fleet,\nrather than annual emission. Second, they are instantaneous forcing and do not account\nfor the difference in persistence between long-lived and short-lived GHGs.\nTable 1: Radiative forcing (RFs) [mW/m2] due to aviation emissions from historical operation of\nthe subsonic fleet in the year 1992 as reported in by IPCC (1999).\n\nEmission/concentration\n\nRF\ncomment\n2\n[mW/m ]\nRange*\nCO2/CO2\n18.0\nInstantaneous forcing due to a change in CO2\n13 to23 concentration of 1 ppmv resulting from cumulative\nCO2 emission from historical operation of the fleet\nto 1992.

The uncertainties arise from a\ncombination of the uncertainties in predicting the change in concentration and in\npredicting the environmental impact from a given concentration change.\n3. Local impacts from aircraft engine emissions at airports\nThe impacts of airport emissions (from aircraft engines and sources associated\nwith other activities at the airport) on local and regional scales is part of the broader\nproblem of local and regional air quality monitoring and should be considered in the\np. 5\n\nbroader context of those environmental factors specific to the region\xe2\x80\x99s air quality\nproblems. It is well known that the same emissions could cause different changes in\nambient concentrations at different locations. In addition, the actual health impact will\ndepend on the population exposure, which in turn depends on the population number and\ndistribution in the region being considered.\nAircraft engine emission levels are specified for the certification of new engine\ndesigns. Specifically, levels of NOx, CO, UHCs, and smoke are regulated and\ndocumented for this certification process. For the gaseous emissions, the emission levels\nare determined for each of four power settings (idle, approach, climb, and take-off), and\nthese four power settings are used in developing inventories for aircraft operations in\nairports. In addition to the emissions levels and emissions rates, time-in-mode must be\nused, and an \xe2\x80\x9cICAO cycle\xe2\x80\x9d has been specified, which stipulates the times relevant for\neach of the four power settings during typical operation. In the case of SO2 emissions,\nfuel sulfur content is the additional parameter needed. The application of ICAO\ncertification data with the ICAO cycle is used in models such as the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s Emission\nDispersion Modeling System (EDMS) to develop inventories of gaseous emissions from\naircraft operating at airports using operational data of airplanes and engine types taking\noff and landing at a given airport.\nAs mentioned in section 1, gaseous and particulate properties evolve at the engine\nexit plane until atmospheric processing takes over, perhaps minutes after emission. Initial\nchemistry and microphysics occurring in the plume and subsequent dispersion needs to\nbe fully understood so that the inventories developed from engine measurements can be\napplied in local and regional models. The atmospheric science community that\ndetermines impacts, on both human health and on visibility, typically does not address\nthe near field nor dispersion processes that propagate the emissions from the engine to the\nlocal scale. So both plume models and dispersion models with chemistry and\nmicrophysics need to be developed, first to scope the problem and then refined, if\nnecessary, to address the question. If needed, the plume modeling and EDMS-type\ndispersion modeling elements need to be exercised fully and coordinated with each other.\nCO is relatively long lifetimes (~ weeks) and can affect the local hydroxyl\nconcentration resulting in changes in concentrations of ozone and methane. CO from\nengine emission is often much smaller than other local sources.\nNOx (NO and NO2) is a participant in ozone formation, and also contributes to\nnitric acid and acidification of aerosols (fog) and rain. In fact, the US EPA has recently\nrecognized NOx as a precursor of PM2.5 in their revisions to the Clean Air Act General\nConformity Regulation. Tracking NOx will serve multiple purposes as a criteria pollutant\nof NO2, precursor for ozone, and precursor for PM2.5. Since the atmospheric impacts are\nnot unique for aviation, these are being studied and updated independently. The relative\ncontribution from aviation NOx may become larger as other sources reduce NOx through\nexhaust treatment. Quantification of and inventories for aviation NOx emission are well in\nhand. Thus, new work in further developing metrics for NOx emissions is not needed\nexcept for the plume evolution issues.\n\np. 6\n\nIn addition to NOx contributing to ozone production and PM mass, the NO2\ncomponent of NOx has specific health impacts of its own, primarily affecting respiratory\nfunction. While the former effects occur on larger scales (urban airsheds) due to the rates\nof formation of ozone and PM, exposure to NO2 depends on the local fractionation of\nNOx into NO and NO2, and is sensitive to the very localized concentration levels of NO2\nemissions. In Europe, in particular, inventories of NO2 on very localized scales around\nairports are being developed to assess NO2 exposures. In this context, it is important for\nNOx fractionation to be determined from aircraft engines as a function of engine\noperation, and to follow that fractionation as the emissions evolve downwind from their\nrelease point.\nFor Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, total inventories can be developed from the\nICAO database. However, HCs are interrelated with volatile particles and, in addition,\nincreased interest may arise in regard to specific hydrocarbons owing to their potential as\nHazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). As such, more detailed emissions characterization\nmay be required in the future. Some important initial work on speciation of HC\nemissions has begun, but dependences on engine and fuel properties are not well known\nat this time. There are also uncertainties about which HAPs are present in engine exhaust\nthat may warrant focused attention. Further research in characterizing HAPs and better\nunderstanding the interrelationships among the HC emissions is needed to move forward\nsensibly and reduce those emissions that have the largest hazard potential in a systematic\nway. Elemental metals, for instance, have been measured from petroleum-powered\naviation sources that have been identified by the EPA as HAPs.\nFor particulate matter (PM) emissions, inventories do not exist and knowledge\nis lacking at present as to how aviation particles differ from other emission sources,\nconsidering both volatile and non-volatile particles. There is significant recent and ongoing research in this area on how they depend on engine operating conditions and\nengine type and technology. Smoke is controlled through the measurement of a Smoke\nNumber, SN, and was developed in parallel with the various gaseous emission\nmeasurement approaches in the 1970s, to reduce the visible smoke trails behind airplanes.\nOnly the maximum smoke emission level is regulated, irrespective of at which engine\npower level that maximum occurs. Thus, while visible smoke has been reduced\nsignificantly in the last decades and the application of the SN can be deemed a success,\nthere is currently no reliable means of developing an inventory of aircraft particle\nemissions. To properly evaluate the influence of aviation growth on local air quality,\nuniformly consistent methodologies, both measurement technology and procedures (such\nas probe and sampling system designs) are critical. A subset of fine PM has been\nrecognized as hazardous to human health. This fraction of fine PM needs to be more\nreadily understood. To illustrate how emissions may have different impacts at different\nlocations, the US EPA has identified NOx, hydrocarbons, SO2, and ammonia as indicators\nof secondary fine PM. Emitted NOx may have very different impacts in area where\nammonia is present. It is well understood that the sulfur in fuels directly contributes to the\ngaseous emissions of sulfates and SO2 from aviation sources. What is less understood is\n\np. 7\n\nhow sulfates and SO2 contribute to secondary fine PM generation, not only as individual\ncontributors, but also in a heterogeneous mixture with other pollutants.\n4. Trade-offs\nReducing emissions across the board is one way to minimize environmental\nimpacts. Unfortunately, designs that reduce one emission may have negative impacts on\nanother emissions. This is the reason why one must consider trade-offs in such designs.\nThere are trade-offs at many different levels depending on how one defines the\ntrade space. In the context of this report, one can consider the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 trade space on global climate impacts from emissions at cruise\n\xe2\x80\xa2 trade space on LAQ and health (PM vs. ozone)from emissions at airports\n\xe2\x80\xa2 trade space between noise and LAQ at local level from airport operation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 trade space between air quality at local versus regional level\n\xe2\x80\xa2 trade space between global, regional and local impacts\nUncertainties associated with estimating the environment impacts play an\nincreasingly important role in trade studies as one includes more dissimilar\nenvironmental impacts in the trade space. The scientific consensus that warming from\nwell-mixed GHGs is proportional to radiative forcing allows one to consider the trade-off\namong well-mixed GHGs without having to specify the exact constant of proportionality.\nIf one considers the trade-offs are among CO2, NOx, H2O and PM emissions at cruise, the\noutstanding science question is whether RF (instantaneous or cumulative) from shortlived GHGs (NOx, H2O, and PM emissions) and their effects on ozone and contrails can\nbe used as a proxy for temperature response in the same way as it is done for well-mixed\nGHGs (CO2). The policy question is whether to have a separate metric for short-lived\nGHGs. Wit et al. (2005) provides an example of how one would approach this. This is\none area where Science can provide critical input.\nThe trade-off at the local level between the effects of changes in ozone and PM\npresents a challenge because the issues will involve health impacts, crop damage, and\nvisibility impairment. The scientific community will be called upon to provide estimates\nof these impacts and their uncertainties for the approach to work. Furthermore, the\nresults will be site-specific, with different criteria for different airports depending on\npopulation density and land use around the airport. For regional trade-offs, the outcome\nwill depend on the size of the region.\nMonetization of the costs and benefits of mitigation is beginning to be used in\nquantifying and analyzing all of these types of trade-offs, and the scientific assessment of\nthe impacts and their uncertainties are critical inputs to these analyses. However,\neconomic analysis of the impacts and of the investments required to make emissions\nreductions is the other key element for the evaluation of trade-offs. Policy makers will\nneed to draw on the integration of the scientific inputs and the economic analyses, as well\n\np. 8\n\nas the social costs and technological requirements, to make decisions on how to\nimplement trade-off requirements for reducing the overall cost of emissions.\nIn deriving strategies for technology developments to minimize environmental\nimpacts, one must remember that the environmental impacts depend on emissions of the\nwhole fleet, not those of a single engine. Technology or regulation could drive the airline\nindustry to change their mode of operation and introduce a vastly different fleet. In such\ncases, trade-off studies would involve fleet designs and predictions of emissions from the\nnew fleet so that the environmental impacts can be assessed.\n\np. 9\n\nReferences\nIPCC, 1999: Aviation and the global atmosphere - A special report of IPCC working\ngroups I and III.
