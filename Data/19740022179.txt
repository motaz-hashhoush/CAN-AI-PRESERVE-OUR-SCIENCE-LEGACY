the re-heat\n\ncurve shows no evidence for the peak observed in the original curve.\nSeveral repeat runs using different samples give essentially the\nsame\nresults.\nAlthough there is a definite effect, the total amount of energy\nreleased is small, amounting to\non a calibration using the\n- 20%.\n\no, -9\n\n,\n\n20 cal/gm.\ntransition in\n\nThis estimate is based\nquartz and is\n\ngood to\n\nThis amount of energy release could not cause a catastrophic\n\ntemperature rise in\n\nthe lunar material,\n\nnarrow temperature interval.\n\nIf\n\neven if.\n\nit\n\noccurred over a\n\nwe further consider the fact that the\n\nenergy release is very broad then it may be concluded that the\nobserved\nenergy release does not constitute a safety hazard.\nThe origin of the observed energy release is not known\nbut could\nbe due to either a radiation effect or a chemical reaction.\n\nIn Figs.\n\n3 and 4 we show previous data obtained in our laboratory on terrestrial\nhypersthene.\n\nIn Fig. 3 a noticeable peak of about 15 cal/gm is observed between\n5500 and 7500C in a sample that was irradiated with 3.7 x 1015 p/cm 2\nof 30 MeV alpha-particles.\n\nThe peak is missing in the non-irradiated\n\ncontrol shown in Fig. 4.\nFrom the safety point of view, the low temperature region immediately above 200C is of more interest than the higher temperature\nregions. We have therefore made a series of runs at higher sensitivity\nusing a low-temperature cell that extends to 5000C.\n\nIn Fig. 5 we\n\nshow a high sensitivity run on as-received lunar bulk fines.\n\nThere\n\nis evidence for a very weak exothermic peak between about 2500 and 4500C.\nThis peak, which is approaching the sensitivity detection limits of\nthe apparatus, represents <4 cal/gm.\n\nBecause of its low value and\n\nits breadth, this peak does not constitute a safety hazard.\nIn the last few days we have made additional measurements in the\n0 to 50000 range using samples removed from the following distances\nfrom the top of the longer of the two core tubes:\n9 cm, 12 cm.\n\nThe results are shown in Figs. 6-10.\n\n0 cm, 3 cm, 6cm,\nIn all cases there\n\nis evidence for the broad low temperature exotherm previously seen in\nthe bulk sample.\n\nIn addition there appears to be a considerable vari-\n\nation from the top to the bottom of the core although the variation\nis not strictly monatonic.\n\nSpecifically, the following values were\n\nfound for the 2500 - 40000C peak:\n9cm, 1.4 cal/gm; 12cm,\n\nocm,(0.Scal/gm;\n\nS.7 cal/gm.\n\nAr\n\n3cm, [.j cal/gm;\n\nThe sample at 6 cm. is clearly anomalous.\n\nThere is a sudden slope\n\nchange at \'# 2750C which persists to high temperature.\n\nOn cooling, the\n\nnew slope persists to low temperature indicating an irreversible change\nin the material.\n\nTo investigate this core position further we ran a\n\nnew sample in the 00\n\nto 800 0 C range using maximum sensitivity.\n\nAs\n\ncan he seen in Fig. 11, both the low temperature and the high temperature behavior are anomalous (see for comparison Fig. 1).\nvery broad exotherm extending from\nenergy release of ;S6 cal/gm.\n\nThere is a\n\n1- 2500 to N7000 C. with a total\n\nAs we shall show later the 6 cm core\n\nsample also gives an anomalous glow curve.. It is tempting to speculate\nthat these anomalies may be correlated with the visual anomaly that\nwas observed at about this depth by Fryxell in his original examination\nof this core.\nIn Figs. 12 and 13 we show high sensitivity runs on samples of\nterrestrial feldspar and pyr.bxene that were irradiated with 3.7 x 1015\n0( particles/cm 2 , The temperature of the samples during irradiation\nwas not measured in these experiments.\n\nIn Fig. 14 we show a sample\n\nof bulk lunar fines that was irradiated with2x13 14 -particles/cm 2\n2\nc\nIn this latter experiment we estimate from thermoluminescence measurements that the temperature of the samples did not exceed\n\nq00C.\n\nthe irradiation.\nIn none of these runs do we see any evidence for a large\nstored energy release induced by the irradiations.\n\nduring\n\nB)\n\nThermoluminescence measurements.\nWe have also made glow curve measurements on the bulk fines and\n\nmore recently on the core tube samples described in Section II (A).\nIn Fig. 15 we show the curve of light output vs. temperature for a\nsample of lunar bulk fines.\n\nThe heating was accomplished in 150 sec.\n\nusing a programmed oven with a nichrome heating element.\n\nThe temper-\n\nature was monitored with chromel-alumel thermocouples and the light\noutput was measured with an EMI 9635QB photo multiplier.\nThe excess of light output in the first heating of the lunar\nmaterial over that in a second subsequent heating measures the thermoluminescence of the lunar samples.\n\nThe obvious interpretation of\n\nthe observed (weak) thermoluminescence is that it represents recombination of trapped electrons that were produced during the prolonged\nirradiation of the material on the lunar surface.\nBefore accepting this conclusion, however, we considered other\npossible explanations for the observed glow curve.\n\nWe first considered\n\nthe possibility that the observed glow was produced by the exposure\nto room light during the handling.\n\nThis was checked by exposing a\n\nsample of as-received lunar material within 3 cm of a fluorescent light\nfor a period of 70 hrs.\noil and heated.\n\nThe sample was subsequently mixed with silicone\n\nWe observed no appreciable difference with the glow\n\ncurve of the sample that had not been exposed extensively to light.\nTo check this point we pre-heated a sample of bulk fines in an atmosphere of argon gas to 500 0 C and then exposed it again to the flourescent light.\n\nOnce more no appreciable effect was observed.\n\nWe also considered the possibility that the glow was produced\nby triboluminescence--the production and storage of trapped electrons\nby mechanical deformation.\n\nTo test this possibility we put a sample\n\nof an as-received bulk fine in a small beaker and then shook it\nvigorously by hand during one hour.\n\nTo complete this series of tests\n\nwe also vibrated a sample of pre-heated lunar material.\n\nNo significant\n\neffect was observed in either case.\nThere rests the final possibility that the observed glow curve\nis caused by a chemical reaction of the lunar material as the sample\nis heated.\n\nSince the sample is heated in an inert atmosphere, we\n\nconsidered this an unlikely explanation.\n\nThere is further supporting\n\nevidence that this is not the cause of the observed glow curve.\na lunar sample is exposed to ionizing radiation from a Sr 9 0\n\nWhen\n\nsource\n\nand subsequently heated, a considerably larger amount of light is\nemitted than in the case of a non-irradiated sample (see Fig. 15).\nThus the lunar material is intrinsically thermoluminescent.\nAny lingering doubts about the authenticity of the observed\nglow curves would appear to be removed by the runs that we have just\ncompleted on the core tube samples.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 16 there is a\n\nstriking difference in the glow curves of samples removed from different\ndepths.\n\nThe top surface sample shows the smallest effect and the\n\nbottom sample the largest.\nA)\n\nThis experiment shows two things:\n\nThe core tube has not been mixed; it is a true vertical section\n\nof the lunar surface and B) the thermoluminescence that we observe is\nan intrinsic property of the lunar material on the lunar surface.\nincrease with depth is not, again strictly monotonic.\n\nThe\n\nAs mentioned\n\nbefore, the fact that the 6 cm and 9 cm samples are rather similar\nnoted\nmay be associated with the thin line of lighter colored material\nby Fryxell in his original examination of this core tube.\n\nThis is\n\nan interesting direction for future research.\nThe observed depth variation could arise in a number of different\nways.\n\nthe\nIt might for example be due to a different sensitivity of\n\nmaterial as a function of depth; this in turn could be due to a\nvertical variation in the radiation damage or in the chemical composition.\n\nMore likely it reflects the normal vertical temperature profile\n\nof the surface; those samples near the top get drained more and those\nsamples deeper down are colder and are drained less.\n\nAlso playing a\n\nrole is the variation of ionization density with depth which increases\nfor galactic cosmic ray bombardment.\nC)\n\nFossil track studies.\nWhen heavy nuclear particles traverse a solid, they disarrange\n\nthe atoms and leave a permanent trail of radiation-damaged material.\nThis trail can be revealed for study by selective chemical etching.\nIf the sample is heated prior to etching, the radiation damage recovers\nand no tracks are found.\nIn a survey of over twenty samples each of olivine, pyroxene, and\nfeldspar we have found that every sample studied had a background of\n\nfossil tracks. The densities were very high, ranging from\n5 x 108 /cm 2 (see for example Fig. 17).\n\nto 4\n\n1 x 107 /cm 2\n\nAlthough we have also\n\nstudied numerous glass spherules, the results are quite variable and\ncannot yet be simply interpreted.\nPreliminary annealing measurements show that the tracks in both\nthe feldspar and olivine are erased almost completely by heating for\n30 min. at 550 0 C.\n\nSince the track densities are initially extremely\n\nhigh in all the grains studied, the effect is very striking.\n\nWe con-\n\nclude from these observations that the vast majority of the crystals\nin the as-received bulk fines have not been severely heated in recent\ntimes.\nD)\n\nX-ray measurements.\nAs a preliminary check on the state of lattice disorder in the\n\ncore tube samples, we chose six crystal fragments at random from the\n12 cm frattion and measured their Laue x-ray transmission characteristics\nIn Fig. 18 we show a typical pattern.\n\nAs far as we can tell from\n\nthese photographs the crystals are not severely disordered as they\nwould have to be if they contained large amounts of stored energy.\n\nSection III:\n\nSome Theoretical Considerations of Expected Energy Release:\n\nIn this section we discuss briefly the theoretical calculation\nof expected stored energy release.\n\nIt is included simply to demonstrate\n\nthat there is no pressing theoretical reason to expect a large effect.\nIt is possible to show by an a priori calculation that the lunar\nmaterials could conceivably contain enough lattice defects to produce\na significant stored energy release.\n\nSuch a calculation involves the\n\nassumption that the lunar materials store lattice defect energy as\nefficiently as graphite.\n\nThe calculation also requires rather maxi-\n\nmizing assumptions about the way in which the samples have been irradiated.\nIt is possible to show however. that the irradiation history of\nthe actual lunar samples is probably incompatible with a large stored\nenergy release.\n\nFor example, our track results indicate a probable\n\naverage track concentration of\ncould give at most\n\n-10 /cm 2 .\n\nSuch a track concentration\n\n0.5 cal/gm of stored energy.\n\nSimilarly it\n\nis\n\npossibl.e to show that the mllaximuiln possible stored energy produced by\nsolar wind particles is\n\n* 1.5 cal/gm.\n\nIt\n\nis\n\nthat the general point defect concentration,\nof tracks, probably contributes less than\n\nalso possible to show\nnot visible in\n\nS cal/gm.\n\nthe form\n\n(t\'his part of the\n\ncalculation is the least certain). Thus we consider it uncertainthat\neven the small amount of stored energy that we observed is due to\nradiation damage.\nThe reasoning sketched out briefly above can get quite complicated\nwhen the details are taken into account.\n\nThe arguments are also not\n\nabove criticism; for example, the track densities are so high that it\n-\n\n,\n\n.\n\n-\n\nis difficult for us to measure a reliable "average" value.\n\nThe major\n\nburden of resolving the question of a potential large stored energy\nrelease must therefore rest with our direct experimental measurements.\nThe direct experimental approach is also more desirable since there\nare potential sources of stored energy other than radiation damage\nthat could conceivably affect the lunar samples.\n\nSection IV:\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe most important single fact is this:\n\nIn every sample that\n\nwe studied, including those from the top to the bottom of a 12 cm. core\ntube, the observed stored energy release was<(o cal/gm.\nthe energy release pattern was very broad.\n\nFuthermore,\n\nSuch material is not\n\nhazardous.\nAn independent arguement on the stored energy question can be\nbased on the track observations alone.\nfollowing:\n\nThe essential point is the\n\nTo have extensive stored energy release, the solid must\n\nbe at a temperature where lattice defects are mobile; but fossil nuclear\nparticle tracks are known to anneal out when the point defects become\nmobile.\n\nHence the presence of fossil nuclear particle tracks indicate\n\nthat no extensive release of stored energy occured prior to our reception of the samples in the laboratory.\n\nThe only exception to\n\nthe above line of reasoning is the ilmenite fraction; as yet we do\nnot know how to reveal tracks ih this material.\nBefore concluding that there is no possible danger of stored\nenergy release there is an important point that must be considered.\nThe glow curves shown in Fig. 16 can be interpreted to mean that the\nsample has been partially heated, perhaps to as high as 200 0 C to 2500C.\nBecause of the observed variation with depth it is extremely\nunlikely that this could be caused by an internal spontaneous heating\ndue to a release of stored energy.\n\nHowever, the question might be\n\nraised whether the samples have been partially heated by an external\nsource such as the LEM rocket exhaust.\n\nIf this were the case, would\n\nit not be possible to have had a large, sharp stored energy peak\nbelow 2500C that was simply missed in the current set of investigations?\nAnd if this hypothetical stored energy had been there, might it not\nconstitute a hazzard for future Apollo missions where fine materials\nwould be collected from locations remote from the rocket exhaust?\nIn the short time that we have had available-it is very difficult\nto prove that such a hypothetical stored energy peak did not exist.\nHowever, we think that its existence is unlikely.\n\nFirstly, we do not\n\nexpect extensive defect migration in this temperature range. Our\nprevious experience with terrestrial feldspars, pyroxenes, olivines,\nand glasses indicates that structural lattice defects anneal out at\nhigher temperatures.\n\nSecondly, we have previously pointed out that\n\nthe large densities of tracks observed in every grain indicates that\nextensive lattice defect migration has not occurred.\nlhave shown\n\n(see Fig.\n\nThirdly,\n\nwe\n\n14) that a\' lunar sample irradiated with 0(-par-\n\nticles does not show a pronounced stored energy peak below 200 0 C.\nIdeally, we would have perferred to have had the time to perform more\nextensive irradiations on cryogenically cooled samples.\n\nHowever we\n\nbelieve that the above is sufficient to show that the hypothetical\nstored energy release is unlikely.\nAs regards the safety question, however, there is an even more\ntelling point; even if the samples did contain a hypothetical stored\nenergy peak that was removed by the rocket. !haust, this energy release\nwas not sufficient to heat the sample substantially above 250 0 C.\n\nThis is proved by the positive effects seen at 250 0 C and above in\nboth the thermoluminescence and the D.T.A. measurements.\n\nHeating\n\nto this temperature in the sample box could probably be tolerated\neven in the unlikely event that it occurred.\nWe are therefore of the opinion that the possible release of\nstored energy by the lunar materials is a very remote hazzard.\n\nV:\n\nSummary:\nThe salient experimental observations are as follows:\n\n1)\n\nDTA runs on as-received lunar fines show two broad exothermic\n\npeaks from 2500 to 400 0 C and from 4500 to 700 0 C.\n2)\n\nDTA runs on core tube samples show these same peaks but with\n\ndifferent intensities, the top giving the least and the bottom the\nmost stored energy.\n3)\n\nThe stored energy peaks always amount to\n\n4\n\n20cal/gm and are very\n\nbroad.\n4)\n\nAlpha-irradiated terrestrial minerals and a sample of irradiated\n\nlunar dust show no large stored energy peaks below 200 0 C.\n\nHowever\n\nthe temperature of irradiation was unknown for the terrestrial minerals.\n5)\n\nBoth bulk fines and core tube samples show measurable thermolumines-\n\ncence curves.\n\nThe output is very low at the top of the core but\n\nincreaser rapidly with increasing depth.\n6)\n\nFeldspar,\n\npyroxene,\n\nand olivine crystals removed from the bulk\n\nfines all contain very large fossil track densities ranging from\n71 x 10\n7)\n\n7\n\nto\n\n>5 x\n\n8\n10 /cm\n\n2\n\nIn laboratory heating experiments, the feldspars have the tracks\n\nalmost completely erased at\n\n- 550 0 C. (30 min. heating) Olivine recovers\n\ncompletely in 30 min. at e-450 0 C.\n8)\n\nSix crystals, chosen at random from the core sample at 12 cm,\n\nhave sharp diffraction patterns and show no evidence of extensive\nlattice disorder.\n\nBased on these experimental observations, we have reached the\nfollowing conclusions:\n1)\n\nBased on our current knowledge of the radiation history of the\n\nlunar surface, there is no pressing theoretical reason to expect a\nlarge energy release.\n2)\n\nNone of our measurements, including those made as a function of\n\ndepth in the core tubes, show a hazzardous release of stored energy.\n3)\n\nThermo-luminescence measurements show that the core tube is a\n\ntrue vertical section of the moon\'s surface.\n4)\n\nThe thermoluminescence and D.T.A. measurements show that the\n\nlunar samples have not been heated substantially above about 250 0 C\nin recent times.\n5)\n\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that the samples were heated by\n\nthe rocket exhaust and that there was a large stored energy release\nbelow 2500C.\n6)\n\nHowever, for a variety of reasons stated in the report we consider\n\nthe existence of such a hypothetical energy release below 250 0 C.\n\nas\n\nunlikely.\n7)\n\nIn any event it may be concluded that even if such a hypothetical\n\nenergy release occurred it did not heat the material substantially\nabove 250 0 C.\nGiven these observations it is our opinion that the danger from\na catastrophic release of stored energy is slight.\n\nc.7\n\nFigure Captions\n\nFig. 1:\n\nDTA run on as-received lunar fines.
