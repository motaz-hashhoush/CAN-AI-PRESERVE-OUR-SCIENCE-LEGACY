Although there have been many ISL studies, .the\'majority of them deal with ISL technology\nwithout, addressing the costs and benefits of ISL\nsystems .architectures. In this study we addressed\na broad range ,of ISL issues arising from an initial set of "considerations." These considerations are briefly examined below:\n(1). The use of ISL\'s permits the placement\nof spacecraft outside the slot locations which\nprovide full CONUS or 48-state coverage. Normally\nsuch "outside" locations would allow only partial\nCONUS coverage. However, by linking such spacecraft to .another satellite in an appropriate\nposition,, full CONUS connectivity can be achieved.\n.(2):Given that spacecraft location impacts\nISL..throughput requirements, this report quantitatively addresses.the following questions:\n, ,(a) What are the required ISL capacities\nas a.function of orbit location?\n(b) What is the potential impact of\nskewed ISL traffic (west to east versus east to \xe2\x80\xa2\nwest) on ISL design?\n<\n. (c) What amount of orbital arc expansion\nis "realistic".? ,\n(3) With the prospect of less than full\nCONUS coverage, single beam spacecraft would have\nhigher gain antennas. This, in turn, would lead\n\nTo address the above considerations, it was\nnecessary to establish some study ground rules.\nFirst, only CONUS traffic was considered. Secondly, the ISL systems were treated as closed\nentities competing with conventional U.S. domestic\nsatellite systems. And finally, competition for\nslot assignments from international or other\nregional or domestic satellite systems was\nignored.\nThe main text of this report is organized\ninto the following study areas:\nA. General ISL Systems Considerations\nB. ISL Technology Assessment\nC. Impact of Crosslink on End-to-End\nPerformance\n\nD. Spacecraft System Cost Comparison\nE. Summary of Conclusions\nA. ISL Systems Considerations\nIn this section, the use of an ISL to alleviate congestion of prime locations in the geostationary orbit is examined assuming a simple\n2-satellite ISL configuration, shown in Fig. 1.\nService is provided to CONUS through the ISL\nnetwork composed of two single-beam spacecraft\nsupplying aggregate coverage. This allows placement of spacecraft outside the normal visible arc.\n\nSatellite Visibility\n\nto-, east" crosslink is-Hkely to require more\ncapacity than the return link.\n\nThe CONUS orbital arc is defined to be the\nregion of orbital slots from which a satellite\ncan provide coverage to all locations in CONUS at\nelevation angles exceeding a specified minimum. The minimum elevation angle required for each\nfrequency band was chosen to limit the amount of\nrain attenuation incurred by a signal as it travels through the atmosphere. The angles were chosen to be 5\xc2\xb0, 10\xc2\xb0, and 30\xc2\xb0 for C, Ku, and Ka-band\nrespectively.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n. - - . . .\nIn determining the CONUS orbital arc corresponding to each frequency band, two reference\npoint locations were\'selected to define the \xe2\x80\xa2\neastern and western bounds of CONUS. They were\nAugusta, Maine -(44.25\xc2\xb0 N/69.750 W) and-Seattle,\nWashington (47.60\xc2\xb0 N/123.400 W). Using.these\nlocations and the appropriate minimum elevation\nangle criteria, the CONUS-orbital\'arcs for C, Ku,\nand Ka-band were\' computed to be:\nFrequency\nBand\n\nMin. Elevation\n\' Angle\n\nCONUS\nOrbital Arc\n\nC\nKu\nKa\n\n5\xc2\xb0\n10\xc2\xb0\n30\xc2\xb0\n\n53 to 141\xc2\xb0 W\n61 to 134\xc2\xb0 W\n97 to 102\xc2\xb0 W\n\n;\n\nTraffic Considerations\nThe distribution of satellite addressable\ntraffic plays a major role in determining prime\norbit locations for ISL satellites. Major metropolitan areas have very large traffic volumes\ncompared to rural areas. This results in a highly\nskewed \'traffic distribution for CONUS, with heavy\ntraffic concentration on the east..and west coasts\nwhere large^population densities exist. As a\nsatellite\' is moved beyond the limits of the CONUS\norbital arc,-the-amount of traffic it can address\ndecreases as a result of its diminishing coverage\narea. .Using"a 45-node in-house trafficrdistribution model,\' the estimate of addressable traffic\nbased on the satellite longitude was determined\nand is shown on Figs. 2, 4, and 6 for C, Ku, and\nKa-band, respectively. Some of. this traffic will\n-be intra-regional and remain in the satellite\'s\nmain beam, the rest requires an ISL to reach-itsdestination. Results of a downlink/crosslink\ntraffic routing analysis are shown in Figs. 3, 5,\nand 7 for C, Ku, and Ka-band respectively. .Also\nshown on these graphs is the 50 percent geographic\ncoverage limit. Within this range of slots, a\nsatellite can provide coverage to at least half\nof CONUS.\nExamination of Figs. 2 through 7 reveals two\nimportant system design considerations. First,\nfor a balanced trafficxload between two spacecraft\nusing an ISL interconnect, area coverage differs\nbetween the east and west spacecraft. This, in\nturn, implies differing spacecraft antenna gain\nand G/T characteristics. Thus, an "ISL system"\nmay be designed for specific orbit locations and\nrequire unique\'earth terminal design depending\nupon which spacecraft is to be accessed. Second,\nand conversely, forcing equal spacecraft coverage\nareas to gain advantages in uniform design of .\nboth spacecraft and earth terminals results in an\nasymmetric ISL crosslink design. By inspection\nof Figs. 3, 5, and 7, we conclude that the "west\n\n. Additionally, crosslink capacity requirements\n.can be-.approximated using Figs. 3, 5, and 7. A\nconventional C-band CONUS coverage spacecraft will\nuse dual polarization to achieve a gross capacity*\nof twenty-four 60 Mbps transponders. For easterly\norbit slot assignments, the ISL capacity (Fig. 3)\ngrows slowly until the 50 percent level is\nreached. Assuming a fully loaded satellite, the\napproximate ISL capacity at 14\xc2\xb0 W is 720 Mbps\n(twe.lve 60 Mbps transponders). An equivalentspacecraft-displacement to the west (39\xc2\xb0) results\nin an orbit slot, at 180\xc2\xb0 (east or west) and a, net,\ncrosslink capacity of 85 percent of full capacity\nor approximately 1.2 Gbps (twenty 60 Mbps transponders). We would-suspect that designs requiring the vast majority of traffic to use the\ncrosslink would likely be rejected by system .\nplanners as inefficient. Thus, it appears that\ncrosslinks for C and Ku-band systems would not\nlikely exceed approximately 1.0 Gbps. By simple"\nbandwidth ratios, crosslinks at Ka-band are not\nlikely to exceed 3 to 4 Gbps.\nIn addition to capacity, satellite separa- .\ntion is an important ISL design parameter. We\nfind from F.ig. 3 .that the maximum orbital separation between two ISL satellites maintaining full\nCONUS coverage is 140\xc2\xb0 for C-band. Figures 5 and\n7 show .that Ku-band has a maximum separation o\'f\n125\xc2\xb0 while Ka-band has a 58\xc2\xb0 separation limit. ,\nSatellite separations, exceeding these -values will,\nnot permit full CONUS coverage between the two. .\nspacecraft.\nBased on the above discussions if we restrict\nISL capacity to no more than 70 percent of total\nspacecraft capacity, since it is unlikely .that\nthis value would be exceeded in a real system,\nthen the potential increase in orbital arc for C,\nKu and Ka-band, respectively, are 71 percent\n(slots from 8 to -162\xc2\xb0 W), 97 percent (slots from\n14 to 158\xc2\xb0 W), and 1433 percent,-(slots/rom 39 to\n130\xc2\xb0 W). These figures were calculated assuming\nthat the orbital-spacing for C and Ku-band sat7,\nellites would remain at 2\xc2\xb0 while the Ka-band satellites would be located at 1\xc2\xb0 intervals. We\nconclude that ISL\'s enable dramatic .increases in\norbital arc utilization for the higher^frequency,\nbands.\nISL Delay ;Impact\nThe traffic distribution model used up to\nthis point represents total long-haul communications traffic that is addressable by satellite.\nThe total traffic can be divided into three service categories. The first and largest service\nis for voice communications, accounting for\napproximately 77 percent of the total traffic.\nThe second is data services which accounts for 8\npercent of the total. The remaining 15 percent\nof the total traffic is comprised of-video\nservices..\nIn a system that employs intersatellite\nlinks, the transmitted signal will.be subjected\nto an additional time delay proportional to the\nsatellite spacing. The CCITT recommends as a\nnetwork performance objective that the mean oneway transmission delay not exceed 400 msec for\nvoice circuits. This is provided that echo\n\nsuppressors and cancellers are used. Of this\n400 msec, approximately 290 msec is used by the\nup and downlinks and the terrestrial extensions.\nThis leaves 110 msec delay for the ISL which will\nallow a maximum satellite separation of 50\xc2\xb0,\nwhich for C and Ku-band prohibits the placement\nof both ISL satellites outside of the CONUS\norbital arc.\nData systems normally employ a form of automatic repeat request error correction (ARQ),\neither stop and wait ARQ or continuous ARQ, the\nformer being most commonly used. After a block\nof data is sent, the transmitter must pause and\nwait for an acknowledgment signal before any further transmissions occur. If the acknowledgment\nis positive (no errors), the next block of data\nis sent; if it is negative (errors), the same\nblock of data is retransmitted. When the path\nlengths, and subsequently path delays, increase,\nthe link throughput is decreased thus lowering\ntransmission efficiency. Continuous ARQ is more\nimmune to transmission delays. With this protocol, the transmitter continually sends data blocks\nand receives back a steady stream of acknowledgment signals. The system requires sufficient\nstorage to hold the data until an acknowledgment\nis received in case the data must be retransmitted. The amount of storage required depends on\nthe bit-rate and the length of the round-trip\ndelay. The incremental amount of buffering needed\nwith an ISL satellite system over conventional\nsatellite systems would be proportional to the\nincrease in the transmission delay.\nThe additional propagation delay of the\nintersatellite link can severely limit the amount\nof voice and data traffic that the system can\ncapture. Voice traffic requirements restrain the\nsatellite separation to 50\xc2\xb0. The length of the\ndelay increases the amount of storage needed for\ndata transmission, or lowers the efficiency.\nPropagation delay has no significant effect on\ntelevision transmission and other one-way\nservices.\nB. ISL Technology Assessment\nIn order to assess the suitability of millimeter wave (MMW) and optical systems for use in\nintersatellite links, a parametric analysis\ninvolving the basic system variables (antenna or\noptic size, transmit power, data rate, etc.), was\nperformed under certain system assumptions. Then\na comparison of the various ISL types was made on\na weight, prime power, and performance basis.\nSelection of RF and Laser Systems\nFor MMW systems, crosslink frequencies in\nthe 23, 32, and 60 GHz bands were studied for\nwhich the allocated bandwidths are 1, 1, and\n5 GHz, respectively. Higher microwave frequencies were not considered because of the lack of\ncomponent technology in these bands. Among the\navailable laser sources are the FD Nd:YAG, HeNe,\nGaAs, and C02 lasers. Characteristics of these\nprincipal laser sources are shown in Table 1.\nThe FD Nd:YAG diode pumped laser and the GaAs\nsemiconductor laser were chosen to be best suited\nfor ISL application primarily because these\napproaches are amenable to simple and efficient\ndirect-detection techniques. Thus, the receiver\nis essentially a power detector or "photon bucket"\n\nand the phase of the received signal is unimportant. This is in contrast to the C02 gas laser\nsystem which requires heterodyne detection and\nhence highly stable transmitters, an additional\nlaser at the receiver for the local oscillator,\nas well as precise tracking of the received optical wavefront and polarization. Further, the\nC02 laser requires cryogenically cooled detectors to suppress internal noise and its present\nlifetime is not sufficient for space qualification. Other reasons why the YAG diode-pumped\nlaser and GaAs laser are the preferred optical\nISL system approaches are long lifetime and reliability, production of modest output power, and\navailability of wide-band traveling wave electrooptic modulators and high-gain low-noise photodetectors. It should also be mentioned that the\nother common laser source, the HeNe laser, while\nbeing the most mature of laser sources with a\nvery high reliability, is severely limited in\noutput power and efficiency; therefore the HeNe\nlaser should probably be considered only for very\nshort-range or intra-cluster ISL applications.\nSystem Parameters and Requirements\nA summary of some of the basic ISL system\nparameters and requirements used in the analysis\nis given below. Values of transmit power represent current or near-term state of the art.\n(1) Frequency: 23, 32, 60 GHz and FD Nd:YAG\n(0.53 tin), GaAs (0.83 jn)\n(2) Satellite spacings: 30\xc2\xb0 to 140\xc2\xb0\n(maximum separation for line-of-sight view\nis 163\xc2\xb0)\n(3) BER:\n\nTO"7\n\n(4) Data rate: 1 Gbps crosslink\n(5) Modulation: uncoded QPSK - MMW systems;\ncontinuous optical carrier intensity\nmodulation, direct detection - lasers\n(6) Antenna/optics diameters: 3, 4, and\n5 ft parabolic reflectors - MMW; 6, 12,\nand 24 in. optics apertures - laser (same\nsize antennas assumed on both ends of\ncrosslink)\n(7) Maximum transmit power: 75 W - MMW,\n100 mW - GaAs, 500 mW - FD Nd:YAG\n(8) Noise source: 1500 K receiver noise\ntemp - MMW; 4xlO\'10 W background solar\nradiation noise - laser (sun modeled as a\nblackbody radiator at T = 6000\xc2\xb0K)\nISL Systems\nIn order to make a comparison of the different ISL technologies in terms of performance\ncapability, prime power required, and weight burden on the satellite, the following approach was\nused: (1) curves relating the required crosslink\nEIRP for a nominal crosslink bit-error-rate (BER)\nof 10\'\' were generated as .a function of satellite longitudinal separation for parametric\nvalues of data rate and antenna/optics diameter\nfor each of the ISL types, (2) average RF and\nlaser output power values necessary to produce\nthe above EIRP\'s were determined, (3) weight and\n\npower models (MMW model was developed in-house,\nwhile the laser model was developed by COMSAT)\nusing the above parameters as inputs were applied\nto the MMW and optical systems to obtain estimates of the ISL subsystem weight and prime power.\nFrom these data, curves relating ISL weight and\nprime power to transmitting EIRP were generated,\nand (4) a comparison was made among the various\nISL types,\'cognizant of the state of art (SOA)\ntechnological constraints applying to each, to\ndetermine which approach offered the least weight\nand power\'burden on the spacecraft for the given\ndata rate crosslink operating over a range of\nsatellite angular spacings.\nThe results of the analysis procedure are\nshown in Table 2, listing each of the ISL systems\nalong with their corresponding variation in\nrequired EIRP, transmit RF or laser power, prime\npower, and subsystem weight as the satellite\nseparation is increased from 30\xc2\xb0 to 140\xc2\xb0. In\nexamining the table, the following comments apply:\n(1) Among lasers, systems using smaller\ndiameter optics weigh less than ones using larger\ndiameters since most of the ISL mass is concentrated in the acquisition and tracking subsystem\n(40 to 70 percent of total weight) where submicroradian tracking and pointing accuracy is\nrequired. As an example of the extremely narrow\noptical beams and formidable pointing problems\ninvolved, an ISL system using a FD Nd:YAG laser\nwith 6 in. optics will transmit a beamwidth of\nabout 4.2 yrad. Therefore, to constrain transmit and receive pointing losses to less than\n3 dB, a pointing accuracy of 2.1 prad is necessary, roughly the angle subtended by a dime from\na distance of 5 miles. The majority of prime\npower is also absorbed in the acquisition/tracking\nand optical modulation subsystems rather than as\ninput to the laser itself. Thus, at a given data\nrate and optics diameter, ISL subsystem weight\nand prime power are relatively insensitive to\nlaser output power and angular separation.\n(2) Unlike the optical systems, MMW ISL\'s\nexhibit a high dependency of prime power and\nweight on EIRP and longitudinal separation. This\nis because TWTA output power is the major factor\ndriving the prime power requirement and resultant\ntransponder and power subsystem weights. Therefore, in contrast to optical systems, it is more\nadvantageous to use larger diameter antennas and\nreduce the rf output power requirement to a\nminimum.\n(3) The 60 GHz ISL implementation using 5 ft\nreflectors offers significant weight and power\nadvantages over the other methods. From Table 2,\nthis package weighing about 35 Kg (77 Ib) and\nconsuming 70 W of prime power 7can sustain a 1 Gbps\ndata rate link at a BER of 10" or better out\nto 140\xc2\xb0 separation. This implementation is 15 to\n25 Kg .lighter than the 6 in. laser systems. It\nshould be noted, however, that COMSAT characterized their optical ISL weight and power model as\nbeing very conservative.\nA closer look at these implementations is\nshown in Fig. 8. Here the data rate has\'been\nextended out to 4 Gbps and ISL package weight is\nplotted as a function of satellite separation for\na crosslink BER of 10"\'. We see that for the\nsame data rate, 60 GHz systems are always lighter\n\nthan laser systems. Laser ISL\'s, however, exhibit\napparent advantages over RF systems in certain\noperating regimes. For data rates greater than 1\nGbps, the laser systems can more easily achieve\nhigh Eb/No.within SOA power levels. Note also\nthat lasers have an important advantage over RF\nsystems at the higher data rates in that their\nweight is for the most part distance insensitive.\nTherefore for a given data rate and performance\nrequirement, an ISL laser package will weigh\napproximately the same regardless of crosslink\nseparation.\nIn contrast, RF ISL subsystem weight is\nhighly dependent on satellite spacing at high\ndata rates (especially 4 Gbps and higher) so that\na major driver of the ISL package design would be\nthe projected ISL separation distance. As data\nrates decrease, however, 60 GHz ISL weight becomes\nmore distance insensitive and the technology\noffers reduced weight and power penalty on the\nsatellite, near-term availability of components,\nand simplicity of design. Also, in comparison to\nother MMW systems, 60 GHz offers the advantage of\nreduced antenna size and TWT power, and larger\navailable bandwidth as well as avoiding the\npotential RFI problem that the 23 and 32 GHz\nbands may encounter.\nFrom the models, laser and RF technology\nneeds can be identified. For RF systems, higher\npower, higher efficiency transmitters are necessary for large separation, high data rate applications. For laser systems, reduced mass\nacquisition and tracking systems and reduced\npower consumption for the laser modulator system\nare necessary for similar applications.\nC. Impact of Crosslink on End-to-End\nLink Performance\nWith the insertion of a crosslink, into a\n2-satellite ISL configuration, overall link performance is degraded, with the weakest of the\nthree segments (uplink, crosslink, or downlink)\ndetermining end-to-end BER, assuming conventional\ntranslating repeaters. Reasonable BER objectives\nare dependent on the type of service being\noffered; generally BER\'s in the range of 10"^\nto lO"^ are considered acceptable for digitized\nvoice data while BER\'s in the range of 10"\xc2\xb0 to\n10"\' are considered satisfactory for digital\nvideo and data signals.\nIn our study of domestic ISL\'s, the impact\nof crosslink insertion was measured by comparing\nthe BER performance of a typical C-band and\nKu-band single satellite system, providing\nsingle-beam CONUS coverage, to that of their ISL\ncounterparts in which each satellite of the\n2-satellite ISL system provides single beam\ncoverage to half the CONUS area. In making this\ncomparison it was noted that: (1) crosslink\ndegradation is partially offset by an improved\nuplink G/T resulting from the use of a larger\nantenna to provide the reduced amount of satellite coverage, and (2) the larger antenna allows\nthe reduction of downlink HPA power while maintaining the same net EIRP. This combination\ntranslates into a net weight savings which can\nthen be reallocated to the ISL subsystem.\nIt should be emphasized that the crosslink\ndegradation results presented in this section are\n\nentirely specific to the-link budget characteristics that were chosen for these systems. Ultimately, the effect on overall performance of\nintroducing the ISL will depend on the relative\nvalues of uplink, crosslink, and downlink Eb/No,\nthe coding technique used, as well as whether IF\nor baseband processing is employed on the satellite. One can imagine an ISL scenario in which\nthe crosslink Eb/No is significantly greater than\nthe uplink or downlink Eb/No so that, performancewise, it is essentially "transparent" to the\nsystem except for the added propagation delay.\nHowever, such large crosslink Eb/No requirements\nlead to large output power levels. To illustrate\nthis, Fig. 9 is a plot of the received crosslink\nEb/No a\'rid the corresponding BER as a function of\nsatellite spacing for a 60 GHz, 1 Gbps link using\n5-ft transmit and receive reflectors and a laser\nlink using 6 in. optics. The separate curves\ncorrespond to different values of RF and laser\noutput power.\n\nto uplink bandwidth. For this reason, such a .\nsystem is unlikely to find application at C or\nKu-band, but may offer some appeal for certain\napplications at Ka-band where a large bandwidth\nallocation exists.\nBy examination of Table 5, the following\nobservations can be made:\n(1) If the single satellite system is\ndesigned for a BER performance acceptable for\nvoice, then it appears that the insertion of the\ncrosslink has no appreciable impact in moving the\nBER performance out of the acceptable range.\nRelated to this point is the fact that propagation delay factors for voice will generally constrain ISL spacings to less than about 50\xc2\xb0 in\nwhich case present or near-term technology permits a much higher quality crosslink (Fig. 9}\nthan the 11.3 dB Eb/No (10-\' BER) link assumed\nhere.\n\nFrom the-figure, we see that more than 130 W\nof RF power at 60 GHz is necessary to maintain a\ncrosslink Eb/No of at least 20 dB out to 140\xc2\xb0\nseparation. This is currently beyond the capability of conventional helix-type TWT\'s. For the\nlaser, the required power level is about 400 mW,\nwhich \'is within the SOA. By going to 12 in.\noptics, this power is reduced to an easily\nachieved value of 25 mW. Thus, in designing\ntransparent ISL\'s for wide angular spacings,\noptical links appear more suitable than MMW given\nthe current state of technology.\n\n(2) If the single satellite system is\ndesigned for a BER performance acceptable for\ndata and video traffic (10~^ to 10"\' range\nrequires R = 7/8 code for C-band, R = 3/4 code\nfor Ku-band), then the resulting BER\'s after\ncrosslink insertion are still satisfactory.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that if the\ncrosslink was effectively made independent from\nthe uplink and downlink through the use of IF or\nBBP at both its transmitting and receiving ends,\nthen "transparency" can be much more easily\nachieved since the overall BER is now the sum of\nthe individual link segment BER\'s. For example,\nfrom Fig. 9, 10"10 BER can be obtained on the\ncrosslink, at 140\xc2\xb0 spacing, using approximately\n50 W and 100 mW for the 60 GHz and laser systems,\nrespectively.\n\nAs mentioned before, the selection of\nuplink-crosslink-downlink design parameters,\ncoding scheme, modulation format, etc., are made\nto conform to a particular system application and\nits requirements. The primary purpose for analyzing these particular configurations was to\ndemonstrate quantitatively what the impact of an\nISL can be, how it relates to the present SOA,\nand where compromises can occur.\n\nRepresentative link budgets for the C-band\nand Ku-band single-beam CONUS coverage systems\nare shown in Tables 3 and 4. Major system parameters are typical of those from the Ku-band SBS\nsystem and C-band RCA Satcom system. Slight\ndifferences exist, however, due to the elliptici-ty of the spacecraft antenna. A comparison of\nthe end-to-end link performance between the\nsingle satellite baseline and ISL configurations\nis shown in Table 5 for both C-band and Ku-band.\nIndicated on the table is the net Eb/No values\nand the BER\'s they produce for coding/noncoding\nmodes of operation. Also shown for the ISL cases\nis the BER performance of the system with IF\ndemodulation/ remodulation on the satellites at\nthe point where the crosslink interfaces with the\ndownlink. In this type of processing, the\nreceived crosslink signal is frequency translated\nto IF and the entire IF signal is remodulated\nonto the downlink carrier. By this method, the\naccumulated noise on the uplink and crosslink is\nisolated from the downlink, which is normally the\nweakest link in the chain. Overall BER is then\nthe sum of the BER\'s on each of the two isolated\nsegments (uplink/crosslink + downlink). The\nobvious penalty in this approach is the necessity\nfor additional downlink bandwidth when compared\n\nThe next stage in studying the feasibility\nof ISL systems was to determine if any payload\nweight margins would result from the trade-off of\nreduced downlink HPA power for increased antenna\ngain, which could accommodate an ISL package\nwithout increasing the overall satellite weight.\nThe satellite payload was defined to consist of\nthe transponder subsystem, the antenna subsystem,\nand the portion of the power subsystem dedicated\nto the transponders. The ISL package was treated\nas a separate entity from the communications\npayload though it is recognized that the two will\nbe interconnected.\n\n(3) For the satellite configurations studied\nhere, the use of demodulating/ remodulating\ntransponders for the ISL is unnecessary unless\none desires an improvement in performance over\nthe single satellite system.\n\nD. Spacecraft Weight and Cost Estimates\n\nUsing in-house payload weight algorithms,\nthe communications payload weight of the ISL\nsatellite was calculated and compared to that of\na baseline CONUS satellite having equal downlink\nperformance. The design of the payloads were\nidentical except for the transmitting power and\nthe antenna size (obtained from Tables 3 and 4).\nThe increased antenna size of the ISL satellite\nproduces a weight penalty, whereas the reduced\ntransmit power lowers the weight and operating\npower requirements. A payload comparison for\nboth C and Ku-band is shown in Table 6. As can\nbe seen from these results, ISL weight margins\n\nwere achieved for both frequency bands. Referring\nto Fig. 8, we see that a 75 1b ISL weight margin\nfor a C-band ISL satellite corresponds to the\nestimated weight of a 60 GHz package consisting\nof a 5-ft antenna and a 25-W TWTA. Implementing\nthis package has the capability 7 offering a\nof\n1 Gbps capacity crosslink at TO" BER for\nseparations as large as 140\xc2\xb0. For medium-range\nseparations compatible with voice transmission\n(40\xc2\xb0 to 60\xc2\xb0), this package would provide very\nhigh quality crosslinks (Eb/No in 10 17-20 dB\nthe\nrange) with BER\'s better than 10" . This margin would have to be slightly greater in order to\naccommodate a laser package (weighing approximately 85 Ib) although the laser ISL weight model\nis considered conservative. Also, from Fig. 8 we\nobserve that a 279 Ib ISL weight margin for a\nKu-band ISL satellite will easily allow implementation of either a laser or microwave ISL package\nproviding crosslink capacities in excess of\n4 Gbps over all angular separations.\nThe final stage was to determine if any economic benefits could be gained in using ISL\'s for\ndomestic satellite communications. The approach\nthat was taken was to compare two ISL satellite\nscenarios to a baseline system. The first ISL\nscenario was one in which full advantage of the\nincreased antenna gain was taken into account\non-board the satellite to provide a weight/cost\nmargin for the ISL package. For this scenario,\nit was assumed the earth stations would have the\nsame design as the baseline scenario. The second ISL scenario used the increased antenna gain to\nprovide a cost-reduction of the earth stations\nthrough reduced earth station antenna gain and\ntransmitting power. This cost savings could then\nbe used to provide for the larger satellite\nantenna-and ISL package. The baseline scenario\nconsisted of two CONUS satellites so that each\nscenario provided the same capacity.\nThe spacecraft cost model (launch cost\nincluded) used for this study was an in-house\nmodel based on the satellite beginning-of-life\n(BOL) weight and end-of-life (EOL) power which\nwere determined by a statistical approach based\non the payload weight and power requirements.\n-The earth terminals for the various scenarios\nwere compared by the cost of their RF equipment\n(antenna, HPA, and LNA). Once again, in-house\nmodels were utilized to determine the costs based\non the following RF system parameters: antenna\ndiameter\', HPA RF power, and system noise temperature. Given the required earth station EIRP and\nG/T (obtained from Tables 3 and 4), these three\nparameters were determined so as to minimize the\nRF equipment cost. The earth station characteristics are given in Table 7. All cost values are\ngiven in 1984 dollars.\nThe results given in Table 8 indicate that\nthe first ISL scenario in which the increased\nantenna gain is advantageously used on-board the\nspacecraft provides a direct cost margin that\ncould be applied toward the two required ISL\npackages. The concept of the second ISL scenario\ndoes not provide such a direct margin. For this\ncase, many earth terminals would be needed to\nsupport the larger satellite antennas and ISL\npackages. Even though the exact cost of an ISL\npackage is unknown, it can be seen that this\nscenario would not be comparable to the baseline\n\nscenario unless an unrealistically high number of\nearth terminals were required.\nE. Conclusion\nISL\'s have the capability of relieving\norbital arc congestion by allowing satellites to\nbe placed outside the normal visible arc with\nreduced coverage area requirements per spacecraft. For moderately high data rates (up to\napproximately 2 Gbps), a 60 GHz MMW implementation seems to currently be the most attractive of\nthe various ISL approaches. Compared to lasers,\n60 GHz has a more mature technology base, is\nsimpler in design, has reduced weight and power\npenalty on the satellite, and avoids the acquisition and tracking problems associated with microradian beamwidth optical systems. However, for\nmulti-gigabit rate, long-range applications\nexceeding the current capability of MMW SOA,\nlaser systems seem to be more appropriate. In\ncomparison with the 23 GHz and 32 GHz implementations, 60 GHz has the advantage of reduced TWTA\npower, reasonable antenna size, larger available\nbandwidth, and immunity to RFI. A 60 GHz ISL\nusing a modest 25 W of RF power and 5 ft reflectors is capable of supporting a 1 Gbps crosslink\nat 10~7 BER for a 140\xc2\xb0 satellite separation.\nThis maximum separation corresponds to each satellite covering half the CONUS area at 5\xc2\xb0 elevation angle minimum for C-band. At separations\nless than 100\xc2\xb0, BER performance exceeds 10"10\nso that for most ISL applications (especially\nvoice service), crosslink degradation on end-toend performance is negligible.\nFor the C and Ku-band single beam cases\nexamined, it has been demonstrated that improvements in uplink and downlink performance can be\ntranslated into weight and power margins to compensate for ISL weight and power penalties. In\nthis way, a two-satellite system connected by an\nISL provides a nearly equivalent or perhaps somewhat superior capability over a simple unconnected\ntwo-satellite single-beam system (consider the ;\nincreased connectivity from a single earth station). However, such advantages are not nearly\nas evident for multibeam satellite systems. For\nthese satellites, there is no inherent advantage\nin less than CONUS coverage. Size, weight, and\npower savings are the direct result of decreased\ncoverage and the resultant decrease in traffic.\nIn order to maintain the same net traffic as the\nsingle CONUS multibeam satellite, two smaller\nmultibeam satellites are required, each equipped\nwith an ISL package. Thus, a net increase in\nservice costs is expected.\nIn improving uplink and downlink performance\nover single satellite systems, ISL\'s have their\ngreatest advantage at Ka-band where the ability\nto place satellites over locations experiencing\nhigh rainfall (normally outside the Ka-band CONUS\narc) allows a 2 to 4 dB reduction in rain fade.\nAs far as economic advantages are concerned, a\nrealistic comparison involves making assumptions\non the ISL and single satellite systems being\nstudied. In the satellite configurations considered in this report, ISL system costs were not\nderived as such. Rather, a cost comparison was\nmade between two CONUS satellites and two satellites operating with an ISL (equal capacities) to\ndetermine the cost margin that can be allocated\n\nto the ISL system. For the C and Ku-band systems,\nthese margins were $23 and $82 M, respectively.\nReferences\n1. Gagliardi, R.M., Satellite Communications,\nLifetime Learning Publications, 1984.\n2.

Abstract\n\nThis paper presents the results of a study on intersatellite link (ISL) applications for domestic satellite communications. The objective was to determine if\nany technical, economic, or performance benefits could be gained by introducing\nintersatellite links into a domestic satellite communication network. In this\nstudy, several key systems issues of domestic ISL\'s are addressed. These include\nthe effect of a skewed traffic distribution on the selection of ISL satellite\norbit locations, tolerable satellite spacing, and crosslink traffic-handling\nrequirements. An ISL technology assessment is made by performing a parametric\nlink analysis for several microwave and optical implementations. The impact of\nthe crosslink on the end-to-end link performance is investigated for both regenerative and nonregenerative ISL architectures. Lastly, a comparison is made\nbetween single satellite systems operating at C-, and Ku-bands and the corresponding ISL systems in terms of ground segment cost, space segment cost, and\nnet link performance. Results indicate that ISL\'s can effectively expand the\nCONUS orbital arc, with a 60 GHz ISL implementation being the most attractive.\n\n17. Key Words (Suggested by Authors))\n\n18.
