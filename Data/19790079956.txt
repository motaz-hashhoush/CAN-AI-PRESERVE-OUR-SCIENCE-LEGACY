Smith\nLangley Aeronaut ical Laboratory\nThe first radial-engine cowling, developed by the NACA in 1927\n(fig. l), marked the transition from the external to the internal\ncooling system. This development provided an important improvement\nin airplane performance by removing engine and heat-exchanger c o w\nponents, which are poor aerodynamic shapes, from the full velocity of\nthe air stream and by providing gains in cooling efficiency and\ncontrol of engine temperature.\nSome years later, airplane speeds had advanced to the pofnt\nwhere the critical speed of components became fmportant. The critical\nspeed of the original cowling was recognized as being low, and an\ninvestigation was initiated in 1 3 to develop a shape having as high\n99\na critical speed as possible and proportions to fit the~xisting\nradial engines. The result of this effort was NACA cowling C (fig. l),\nwhich has a critical k c h number of 0 6 (480mph at sea level) and\n.3\nhas been virtually a standard on American radial-engine aircraft since\nits development (reference 1) A short time later, nose B was\ndeveloped (reference 2 and fig. 1) This shape is il longer nose\ninlet designed for use with submerged engine designs or jet propulsion\n.4\ninstallations, and has a critical Mach number of 0 8 (640 mph at sea\nlevel). These two inlets, NACA cowling C and nose B, were derived on\nthe same basis, that is, to have a flat pressure distribution and,\ntherefore, the optfmum critical speed for the particular proportions\ninvolved.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe fuselage nose position for air inlets has received considerable\nattention at the Langley Laboratory because of the aerodynamic advtages offered by this position. Such an air intake is located in a\nnatural stagnation region wherein external compression can be\n0\naccomplished at an efficiency of 1 0 percent. Also, no boundarylayer prdblem is encauntered, and there exists the fact that the\nexternal drag of a body with a properly designed nose inlet is as low\nas or lower than the drag of a streamlined body. Experimental data\n(from reference 2) illustrating this last item are shown in figure 2\n.\nThe tick at the left is the drag coefficient of the basic body, whereas\nthe curve shows the external drag of the body with nose B inlet through\na range of internal flow. At flow rates above a certain minimunz. value,\nthe external drag is clearly seen to be equal to or slightly less than\nthe drag of the basic body. The higher drag at low flow rates f e due\nto the fact that a pressure peak exists at the lip for this condition,\nand this peak fixes transition at a point well forward and produces\nhigher skikfriction drag.\n\nFrom the aircraft designer\'s po3nt of view, it was highly\ndesirable to.expan3 the information available on nose inlets to permit\ndesign of a nose inlet for any desired subsonic Mach number. Upon\nC\nexamination, the nose B and N.ACA\'cow1,in.g ordinates, reduced to\nnondimensional form, were foun3. to be practically the sme. Since\nthe very different critical speeds of these air inlets were apparently\ndue to }le different geometric propo-retioris, appeared possible that\n,i\nit\na whole series of nose inlets might be based upon common ordinates.\nBi use of ti-e nose E ordinates, tkerefore, the systematic family of nose\ninlets shown in figure 3 was designed and was tested to determine the\neffects of propol,tions on critical speed characteristics (reference 3)\nThe length ratio (x/D) is shown across the top and the inlet diameter\nratio d/D down the side. The inlet shown in the upper left is\napproximately nose B, whereas the one in the lower right is very close\nto PU\'ACA cowling C.\n\n.\n\nThe results of tests of one of these nose inlets are shown in\nfigure 4. In the left figure are the preaoure distributions over the\nexternal surface of the inlet at three values of inle% velocity ratio,\nwhich is the ratio of inlet velocity to f r e ~ t r e a m\nvelocity. I can\nt\nbe seen that the pressure distribution remains flat, with a low peak\nvalue, down to some lov value of V1/vO, below which the high local\nangle of attack of the lip causes a pressure peak to occur. This peak\ncontin~~es increase in height as QIIVO is further decreased. The\nto\nestimated critical l l c numbers obtained from these pressure distrivah\nbutions are shown in the right half of figure 4 plotted against inletvelocity ratio. It can be seen that the critical Mach number of the\nnose inlet remains approximately constant as the inlet-velocity ratio\nis decreased until the poht\'is reached where a pressure peak appears\nat the lip. %low this value of inlet--relocity ratio, the critical\nMach n~unberdecreases rapidly.\n\n%\n\nThe values of critical h c h number below the "knee" of the curve\nare of course in need of qualification because they were estimated\nfrom sharp local peak pressures, and it has been shown in varioua\nwind-tmel tests of airfoils and bodies that such local peaks may\ndisappear at higher rkc. numbers or have little effect upon the Mach\nvt21\nnumber at which adverse compressibility effects occur. This phenomenon\nis discussed in connection with airfoils in the paper by Becker\nentitled "Characteristics of Wing Sections at ?\'ransonic Speeds. " It\nis, however, desirable aerodynamically to avoid this condition for\nreasons of possible compressibility effects, separation, or, as was\nshown in f i v e 2, higher skin friction.\nThe region to the right of the knee of the critical k c h number\ncur7,c o \' fi p i =4 , t,kierefore, is of primary interest. Since in most\nt\nairplane installations the minimum inlet-velocity ratio i encountered\ns\na?,the maxirmrm speed of\'the airplane, t . knee of tke curve \'F~ecornes\nie\n\na logical "design point" for the particular nose inlet. In other words,\nan airplane for which maximtun k c h number and air-flaw requirements at\nthe maximum Mach number correspond to the "knee" of the curve will,\nat speeds other than maximum, be operating below and to the right of\nthe design point in the region where a flat pressure distribution\nexists.\n\n,\nThe values of $ and. %/TO at the desis point was found in\nthe wind-tunnel tests to be a function of the proportions of the nose\ninlet. Accordingly, the design points of the series of nose inlets\nshown in figure 3 have been arranged in the form of design charts,\nfrom which the proportions of a nose inlet can be selected to fulfill\nany design requirements of air flow and critical k c h number. The\ndesign chart is s h a m as figure 5. A sample selection is shown by\nthe arrows. Ehtering the lower section with the desired value of\nmass flow ratio and. proceeding vertfcally to the value of critical h c h\nnumber desired, the entrance diameter ratio d/D can be read.\nContinuing to the top section of the chast, the length ratio X./D is\nobtained. Combining these proportiona with the 1-series ordinates\nthe required noae inlet shown at left center is obtained. Two other\nselections, for h c h numbers of approximateljr 0.63 and 0.9, are shown\nto scale and illustrate the variation in proportions with m c h number.\nThe design charts actually cover a number of different types of\ninlets, the first of which is of course the plain open-nose inlet as\napplied to a jet machine. Mention has been made previously of the\nexcellent drag characteristics of this type of installation.\nTwo additional types of installations which can be designed from\nthese charts are shown in figure 6. The upper one is a more or less\nconventional configuration where the propeller is located on a spinner\nahead of the air inlet, An analysis (reference 3) of existing data\nfrom various cowling tests provides an indication that the effects of\na spinner of reasonable size upon the characteristics of a cowling are\nsmall. Cowlings for use with spinners can therefore be selected *om\nthe design charts, taking into account only the flow area blocked out\nby the spinner. An additional problem exists with this type of inlet,\nhowever, in that the boundary layer on the spinner will separate if\nthe inlet-velocity ratio is too low. This phenomenon is purely a\nresult of the pressure gradient ahead of the air inlet, produced\nprincipally by the inlet-velocity ratio. Analysis (reference 3) of\ndata from tests of many cowlings indicates that a value of inletvelocity rat10 of at Peast 0 4 is required to eliminate separation\n.\nfromthe spinner. Thfs value is, of course, higher than that which\nmlght otherwise be used in order to minllnize internal losses. More\non this problem is presented herein in connection with fuselage scoops.\nThe lower installation shown in figure 6 is an NACA rotating\ncowling in which the forward part of the cowling rotates with the\n\n.\n\npropeller (reference 4) Although more complicated mechanically, this\ntype of installation offers several aerodynamic advantages. The problem\nof boundary-layer separation at the entrance (due to inlet-velocity\nratio) 18 eliminated since no surPace protrudes beyond the inlet. Also,\nthe propeller shanks, which are often difficult to make optimum both\naerodynaulically and structurally, can be housed in generous fairings\nin the lower velocity region within the spinner. By this means, the\ninternal efficiency is improved, particularly on installations of high\npower where a large number of wide blades are needed. The propulsive\nefficiency is also improved because only the more efficient outboard\nsectiow of the propeller are exposed to the air stream. Several tests\nof these types of installations have indicated that the aerodynamic\nadvantages of the rotating type are larger than the weight and\nstructural penalties incurred, particularly for installations of very\nhigh power.\nAnother type of "stagnation inlet" is, of course, the wing-leadingedge inlet. The problems involved in the design of wing inlets are\nmore n~smerousthan for other types. The effectivmle-of-attack\nrange through which the inlet must operate is higher because of the\ninduced angle of attack which occurs ahead of the wing. If the inlet\nis located behind a propeller, the effective angle will also be\naffected by propeller power. The inlet must have a high critical k c h\nnumber at one end of the speed range and a high value of maximum lift\nat the other, while maintaining reasonable drag characteristics throughout the operational range of lift coefficient and inlet-velocity ratio.\nThe wing inlet is of interest primarily for aircraft having wings of\nhigh or mdium thickness since the very thin wings of high--speed aircraft\ndo not offer the t h i c W e s or internal space for inducting the large\nvolume of air required.\nBecause of the large number of variables an3 problems involved,\ndesign data for wing inlets are not available from which an inlet can\nbe chosen without a development program being required. However, the\ngeneral physical configuration required for satisfactory characteristics\nis known from numerous development programs. Figure 7 compres such a\nconfiguration (reference 5) with an earlier and less satisfactory\ndeve1opmm.t (reference 6) The early inlet shown in the sketch at the\nlower left is characterized by relatively sharp lips, a large opening\nheight, and no lip stagger. The pressure distribution over the upper\nPip at zero lift is flat, with a value of peak pressure which, although\nnot shown, appears low. At a lift coefficient of 0.55, however, a high\npressure peak exists at the lip, which is undesirable from the standpoint\nof drag (transition), critical speed, and, at a still highsr angle of\nattack, m a x i m lift.\n\n.\n\nThe inlet at the right shows a more rounded pressure distribution,\nalthough a slightly higher value of peak pressure, and it evinces only\na small pressure peak at a lift coefficient of 0 6 . This inlet possesses\n.6\nthlcker lips, a small inlet height, and a noticeable Zip stagger.\n\nThe m a x i m lift characteristics of thsse two configurations a d\nof a basic airfoil section are shown in the left half of figure 8\n.\nAs might be expected, the sharp-edge inlet (a) has a very low m a x i m\nlift at low flow rates, rising to about the same as the basic airfofl\nsection when the favorable effects of air flow are felt at the higher\ninlet-velocity ratios. The air inlet (b) has a higher maximum lift\nthan inlet (a) or the basic airfoil section through a wide range of\na i ~low quantity.\nf\nThe inlet losses for inlets (a) and (b) are shown in the right\nhalf of figure 8. Again, the sharp lips of inlet (a) have produced\nlarge losses outside a narrow range of lift coefficient. Inlet (b),\nhowever, shows essentially zero Inlet losses thro~gha wide range of\nlift coefficient, adequate for the particular airplane involved.\nThus, a wing-leadingedge inlet which has good aerodynamic chwacteristics has a small entrance-to-thickness ratio and relatively thick,\nstaggered inlet lips well-rounded into a bell-mouth shape.\nSeveral advantages of the stagnation type of air inlet have already\nbeen listed and discussed. In spite of these advantages, it often\nhappens that other factors dictate the Use of an air scoop or air inlet\nlocated aft on the fuselage. Such factors may include armament in the\nnose, pilot visibility, ducting length and weight, eve-11 structl~ral\nweight, and airplane stability.\n\nThe two primary problem8 involved in scoop 6esign are boundary\nlayer and interference. Figure 9 illustrates the boundary-layer\nphenomena (reference 7 . In the upper left is a sketch of a fuselage\n)\nand scoop. Blow the sketch is plotted the boundmy-layer thickness\nalong the fuselage ahead of the scoop for three values of inlet-velocity\nratio. At the highest value, 0.9, the boundary layer grows at a normal\nrate up to the scoop entrance. At an inlet-velocity ratio of 0.5 aome\nthickening at the entrance is found; and at the loTdest inlet-velocity\nratio, 0.2, the boundary layer has apparently separated and has reached\na thichess equal almost to the scoop entrance height. A cross plot of\nthe boundary-layer thickness shown at the right indicates that separation\napparently occurs when the inlet-velocity ratio is decreased below\nar\napproximately 0 6 This phenomenon is the same as that which w e\n..\npreviously mntioned as occurring on cowling spinners. The comequences\nof the separation shown were, of course, a reduction in air-flow quantity\nand a substantial increase in inlet losses. Providing the scoop shown\nwith a boundmy-layer bypass which removed a thickness slightly more\nthan the boundary-layer thickness for Yl = 0 9 eliminated the\n.\n\nPo\n\nseparation entirely and restored the pressure, recovery to essentially\nPO0 percent.\n\nIn figure 10 (from reference 3) is shown the critical h c h number\ncharacteristics of three longitudinal planes of the scoop vith bolindarylayer removed: the bottom plane, shown by the solid line, the side\nplane, shown by short dashes, and the fillet plane, shown by long\ndashes. The scoop %-as designed by use of the NACA l-series nose inlet\nordinates. For comparison, the critical k c h number curve for the\ncorresponding NACA l-eeries nose inlet is shown as the top curve. The\ncurves for the two lower planes have essentially the same shape as the\ncurve for the nose inlet but are displaced downward because the scoop\nTs located in the flaw field of the wing. The curve for the fillet\nplane is displaced still farther and its shape is changed somewhat.\nThese data show that the external contour of a fuselage scoop can be\ndesigned with the aid of the NACA l-series nose inlet charts provided\nthat proper allowance is made for the interference of wing or fuselage.\nWhile problem do exist in the design of efficient air exits,\ntheir magnitude and number,are by no means comparable to those involved\nin the design of air inlets. The optimum location for emitting air is,\nof course, at the tail of the fuselage or body, since here mutual\ninterference of fuselage and the air jet are minimized. In cases\nwhere the air exit must be located elsewhere, a few simple rules shotcld\nbe followed: First, the air exit should be located in a region of lox\nInduced velocity to minimlze interference effects; second, the air\nshould be directed outward parallel to the passing-air stream; and\nthird, the body aft of the exit should be undercut to allow for the\nthickening effect of the air jet.\nFigure 1 illustrates this third item and shove pressure distri1\nbutions over an air exit with and without undercutting (reference 8 .\n)\nIt should be noted that a pressure peak (solid line) is induced at\nthe exit by the effective bump produced by the mass of air flowing\nfrom the exit. Undercutting the exit (dashed line) reduced this peak\nto only a small increment above the value of pressure coefficient\nmeasured with the exit faired over. Doubtless, this dashed profile\ncould be improved by still more undercutting and the superstream\nvelocities eliminated altogether, at least for certain operating\nconditions.\nAlthough this paper deals primarily with the subject of air inlets,\nit is appropriate to include several references on duct and internal1.\nsystem design (references 9 to 1 ) These references do not in themselves constitute complete coverage of the subject, but, like many of\nthose listed at the end o \' this paper, provide a digest of much of the\nf\navailable information. Each paper contains a list of references which\nmay be used in an extended study of the subject.\n\nIn considering briefly the problem of supersonic air inlets, it\nis interesting to consider the case of a subsonic nose inlet operating\nat transonic and supersonic speeds. (see fig. 12. ) At supersonic\n\n.\n\n:\n\nspeeds, a conventional nose inlet with rounded lips is foknd to have a\nbow wave ahead. Through this bow wave there is a loss in total\npressure of the air, both that entering the inlet and that going\naround the body. The total pressure loss throcgh a normal shock, which\napproximates the loss through the center part of a bow wave, is shown\nin the upper right corner of figure 12. It can be seen that the loss\nis small at low supersonic Mach nmibera - of the order of 2 percent\nat M = 1.3. This means that the losses encountered at low supersonic\nMach numbers with this type of inlet will be small. This inlet is\nsuitable for use, then, in the transonic range, with the added advantage\nof good characteristics throxgh the subsonic range.\nAt higher supersonic h c h numbers, however, the losses increase\nf\nsignificantly, and other types of inlets must be considered. I the\nblunt lips of the subsonic inlet are replaced with suitable sharpedged lips and if the inlet-velocity ratio is increased to 1 0 the\n.,\nbow wave may be eliminated and replaced by an external oblique shock\nand by a normal. shock in the diffuser, as sham in the lover half of\nfigure 12.\n\nI a normal diverging subsonic diffuser is used, the shock will\nf\noccur at a Mach nurdber equal. to or higher than the flight &ch number.\nThis means that, although the .external conditions may be improved by\nusing this type\'of inlet, the internal losses will be higher than for\nthe subsonic configuration of figure 12.\nThe configxation shown in figure 13 incorporates a convergingdiverging diffuser (reference 12) in an attempt to compress the flow\nsupersonicEally and cause the shock in the diffuser to occur at a\nlower b c h number,\nThe upper curve at the right gives the contraction ratio between\nentrance and throat for isentropfc compression to M = 1 at the throat.\nThis throat area is, however, too small for the establishnent of supersor.iz\nflow in the con-~erging\nsection, since in order to "swallow" the shock,\nthe throat must first pass the mass flow required for an inlet-velocity\nratio of unity at the reduced density and total pressure due to the bow\nwave. The lower curve gives the masirrmm. contraction ratio which can be\nused if a diffuser is to start or "swallow" the shock. The permissible\ncontraction ratio is seen to be about half that required at M = 1 6\n.\nand less at higher Mach numbers; Thus, the requirements for starting a\nconverging-diverging diffuser reduce the effectiveness of this configuration serio~slyin that large losses are still encountered throagh the\nnormal shock in the diffuser at higher supersonic Mach numbers.\nThe type of air inlet shown schematically at the lower left was\nsuggested by Oswatitsch in Germany (reference 13) and makes use of the\nmore efficient compression through several oblique shocks on a conical\nbody ahead of the inlet. After compression to a low supersonic Mach\n\nnumber ahead of the entrance, the f1.m enters a convergi@i.~erging\ndiffuser in which a normal shock occurs as in the previous case, but\nat a very low supersonic h c h number with, of course, improved\npressure recovery.\nThe following statements are made in summary:\nDesign charts are available from which optim-critical--speed\nnose inlets can be selected for any required subsonic h c h number.\nThese charts may also be used in the design of rotating cowlings,\ncowlings for use with spinners, and to aid in the deeign of fuselage\nscoop contours. In configurations where boundary layer exists ahead\nof an air inlet, either the inlet-velocity ratio must be kept high\nenough to prevent separation or a suitable scoop or bypass must be\nprovided to remove the boundmy layer.\nWlng-inlet shapes have been developed which have maximLun lift\nhigher than plain airfoil sections and which have critical Mach number\nand internal pressure-recovery characteristics adequate for the\nairplanes involved.\nThe subsonic nose inlet can be used effectively at low supersonic\nMach numbers becauee losses through the normal shock (or bow wave). are\nsmall at lob- supersonic Mach numbers. At higher supersonic h c h numbers\na different cod-iguration is needed which has eharp leading edges and\nwhich utilizes the most efficient arrangement of shocks possible for\ncompressing the inlet flow. One such configuration utilizes a series\nof oblique shocks on a central conical body for compression to lov\nsupersonic k c h numbers ahead of the inlet.\n\n1 Robinson, Russell Go, and Becker, John V. : Higwpeed Tests of\n.\nConventional Radial-Engine Cowlings.
