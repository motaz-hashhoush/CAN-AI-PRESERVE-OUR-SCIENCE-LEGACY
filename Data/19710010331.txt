Sherman\nGeneral Electric Space Sciences Laboratory, Valley Forge, Pa.\nand\nE. Reshotko\nCase Institute of Technology, Division of Engineering, Cleveland, 0.\n(Consultant, General Electric Space Sciences Laboratory)\n\nIn the study of practical magnetohydrodynanc devices such as\ngenerators and accelerators recent experimental and theoretical\nresearch has shown the importance of non-equilibrium ionization for\ntheir successful operation. At the samhe time, these experimental\nresults have demonstrated the existence of large voltage drops at the\nelectrodes; thereby preventing full utilization of the non-equilibriun\nionization. These voltage drops, occur not only in the thin sheath at the\nbase of the channel- boundary layer, but also partially in the boundary\nlayer itself. Presently available theoretical analyses of the magneto\xc2\xad\nhydrodynamic boundiry layer take into account non-equilibrium\nionization in\'only an approximate manner, and neglect the sheath as\nwell. They have not been able to predict the large voltage drops\nobserved experimentally.\nThe present paper will formulate the magnetohydrodynamic\nboundary layer problem when non-equilibrium ionization exists. In\nparticular it will be shown that when non-equilibrium ionization is taken\ninto account properly, that the characteristics of the sheath at the base\nof the continuum boundary layer are essential to the correct solution of\nthe problem. In addition, since non-equilibrium ionization occurs more\nreadily when segmented electrodes prevent Hall currents, it is important\nto be able to analyze the boundary layer over an electrode wall with\nalternate finite electrode and insulator segments. For this reason\nsolution, of the equations will be carried out by a finite difference technique.\n\nPROBLEmS IN J x B PLASMA ACCELERATION\nJames A. Fay, Marvin Goldstein and Peter Sockol\n\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nThis research is concerned with problems encountered in accelerating\ncollision-dominated plasmas by an externally applied magnetic field inter\xc2\xad\nacting with currents also supplied from an external source. A principle\nfocus of the research is the interaction of the current-carrying plasma\n\nwith solid boundaries.\nSummarized briefly below are accounts of progress\non four related problems.\n\n(a) Experimental measurement of heat transfer to the walls of a\n\nFaraday shock tunnel is being investigated. Heat transfer is measured by\n\nmonitoring the temperature rise of "thin" and "thick" film heat transfer\ngages with an infrared detector. Two types of gages are being developed.\nThe first is a heat capacity-gage with 0.1 microsecond response time for\n\nmeasuring rapidly varying heat transfer. The gage consists of carbon and\n\naluminum coatings applied to thallium bromide or arsenic trisulfide windows,\n\nthe temperature being monitored by a mercury doped germanium detector at\n\nliquid helium temperature. The second gage which is being developed to\nmeasure heat transfer to an emitting electrode, consists of a thicker\nmetallic coating for which the response time is about 10 microseconds but\nwhich is sufficiently thick to conduct the emitted current without being\nheated by Joule losses in the electrode surface of which the gage is an\nintegral part. At the present time nroblems of gage coating, infrared\ntransmission, calibration, etc. are being studied. Also, a test section for\nuse with the gages is being tested.\n(b) A new formulation for transport effects in multi-component\n\nboundary layers has been devised which shows promise of simplifying the\n\nnumerical solution of plasma boundary layer problems. This new method in\xc2\xad\nvolves direct use of certain moments of the linearized Boltzmann equation\n\nfrom which the gradients of conserved properties are linearly related to the\n\nfluxes of these same quantities, and bears some resemblance to the transport\nlimit of the Grad moment method. In combination with the conservation laws\n\nrelating the divergence of the fluxes with convective derivatives and source\n\nterms, a set of first order differential equations is obtained (total dif\xc2\xad\nferentials in the case of similarity-type boundary layers) in which the usual\n\nmulti-component transport coefficients, such as the total thermal conductivity,\n\ndo not appear explicitly. An additional advantage of this method is that\ndifferent temperatures of electrons and heavy species and different levels of\n\napproximation in the Sonine polynomial expansion of the perturbation to the\n\ndistribution function may be used for different species, which is important\n\nfor plasma boundary layers. A report is being written for distribution.\n\n(c) A theoretical study of Hartmann boundary layers in a homo\xc2\xad\npolar device has yielded preliminary results which are in approximate\n\nagreement with experimental measurements. The theory takes into account two\nenergy equations, (one for the electrons and a second for the heavy particles),\na diffusion equation for the electron-ion pairs and a momentum equation for\n\n\n4\nthe heavy species. Approximafte solutions, which use average values of the\n\ntransport coefficients, show that the flow velocity in the homopolar\n\ndevice is an-appreciable fraction of the "ionizationvelocity," i.e., the\n\nvelocity of an atom whose-kinetic energy equals its ionization energy, and\n\nthat appreciable variation in the degree of ionization can result from \xc2\xad\n,small changes {n the total current, -at least for the small degrees.of ioniza\xc2\xad\ntion for which the present approximate solutions are valid.\n(d) A zero-order theory for the stabilization by a magnetic field\n\nof an arc transverse to a flowing steam has been devised. It is based on a\n\nmodel in wOhich the hot arc column is mbtionless, but is in static equilibrium\n\nwith the dynamic pressure of the "cold" stream in which it is immersed, and\n\nto which heat is conducted from the hot column. In this zero-order theory,\n\nthe cross-sectional shape of the arc column is determined from the momentum\n\nequation and the temperature distribution within the column is determined\n\nfrom the energy equation. The solution of these equations leads to relation\xc2\xad\nships between the stabilizing magnetic field strength and the flow-velocity,\n\nbetween the electric field and the width of the column, and.also -betweenthe\n\narc power and the average temperature. The first tw9 relationships are in\n\napproximate agreement with the measurements of Myers\n\nA\n\nMeyers, T. W., "Experimental Investigation of the Balancing Mechanism and\n\n.Electrical Properties of an Argon Arc in Crossed Convective and Magnetic\n\nFields," 7th Symposium on Engineering Aspects of NHD. (1966)\n\n\nELECTRODE EFFECTS IN ACCELERATORS\nBy\nS. Aisenberg\nP. Hu\nV. Rohatgi\n\nS. Ziering\nSPACE SCIENCES, INC.\n301 Bear Hill Road\nWaltham, Massachusetts\n\n1.\n\nExperiments and Analysis\n\nA number of problems are investigated experimentally and analy\xc2\xad\ntically in order to give a better understanding of some of the important\nphysical processes involved in plasma surface interactions. The\nfeatures studied include: the tangential drag on electrodes in J x B\naccelerations; the arc construction processes; and a theory proposed\nto explain electron emission from cold cathodes.by an ion microfield\nemission process.\nThe tangential ele\'ctrode drag forces are measured for an arc in a\ntransverse magnetic field, and it is shown that the cathode and the\nanode tangential forces are an appreciable fraction of the I x B forcb\ndriving the plasma. The presence of tangential electrode (and boundAry)\nfriction forces is expected for a hot plasma flowing in a channel when\none considers that some of the tangential momentum is transferred each\ntime-an ion, electron, or gas atom collides with the surface.\nThe basic features of the electrode structure used in this experiment\nare shown in Figure 1. The force measurements are made for the central\nelectrode which is operated as the cathode or alternatively as the anode.\nThis central electrode is supported on a torsion spring structure so that\nthe tangential force (or torque) can be determined from the angle of\nrotation.\nSome results are illustrated in Figure 2 where the measured tangential\nforce is shown as a function of magnetic field for a 77 amp dc arc in\n24 Torr of argon, and where the central electrode is operated as a cathode\nas well as an anode. The cathode force due to ion current drag is\ndeduced by as suming that the neutral gas component at the cathode is\nthe same as the anode drag. (This assumption should be examined\nfurther because the boundary layers at the anode and cathode may be\nvery different). The measurements show that:\n\n1) \t There is a pronounced threshold in the cathode and anode force as\na function of magnetic field and of arc current.\n2) \t If it can be assumed that the momentum transfer to the anode is\npredominately due to the neutral gas atoms, there appears to be a\nthreshold in the electrode drag by the neutral gas components.\n3) \t\n\nThe cathode drag appears to show a saturation.\n\n4) \t The cathode force is as large as 24% of the input force driving the\nplasma, and the anode force is. as large as 13%.\n5) \t The deduced ion current component is larger than the neutral gas\ncomponent, and in the range measured, is about 16%,of the plasma\ndriving force.\nThe tangential force on an electrode is proportional to the tangential\nvelocity, to the perpendicular particle current flow, and to the tangential\nmomentum accommodation coefficient. The observation that the tangential\nforce at the cathode was larger than the anode force indicates that the\'\npositive ion current flow to the cathode is capable of transferring an\nappreciable tangential force to the cathode. The direct measurements of\nthe electrode drag forces show that the effect is serious enough to be\nconsidered further and at the same time gives interesting data that\nshould be considered by any proposed models.\nAn analysis was made of the arc constriction processes because the\nconstriction influences the plasma surface interaction. The constriction\nmechanisms considered involve the balance between the input power to\nthe plasma and the following modes of power loss: 1) diffusion loss for,\nlow pressure plasmas, 2) radiation loss for high density, high temperature\nplasmas, 3)thermal energy loss for higher pressure plasmas, 4) convec-t\ntive energy loss due to the flow of cooler gas. The available data and\nthe theory both show that for the diffusion and for the thermal conductivity\nmode loss, the product of the current density T and the arc current\nshould be constant.\n2. \t Theory\nIn order to clarify plasma electrode interactions and facilitate a\n\nclearer understanding of the physical parameters governing sheath\n\nphenomena, the existing collisionless theory of a plasma sheath near\nan infinite planar electrode is examined in detail. Ranges of validity,\nas well as difficulties with the existing sheath models are investigated.\nThe \tassumption of inonoenergetic particle istributions, as used \'for\ninstance in "Bohm\'s Sheath Criterion" restricts the usual analysis. To\nremove this difficulty Maxwellian particle distribution functions are\n\nassumed. In addition, microscopic boundary conditions are assumed\nto incorporate the respective electrode and plasma parameters. A new\nsheath model is then developed withqut imposing the usual sheath\ncriterion for the conditions specified at the sheath edge. Explicit\nresults for the current-voltage relation and for the sheath thickness\nare obtained for the improved sheath model proposed in this study.\nOther important physical quantities are expressed in terms of the\nelectrostatic potential, which can be calculated by a quadrature sub\xc2\xad\nject to the physical parameters to be specified. The general solution\nreduces to a simple analytic form for the special case where the tem\xc2\xad\nperature of the electrons, ions and the electrode are identical.\nBased on the above work, the next logical step in a systematic\nanalysis necessitates consideration of ionization processes in the\ndomain of the pre-sheath as well as the sheath itself. Towards this\nend it was found necessary to construct kinetic equations which in\xc2\xad\ncorporate ionization processes. Ionization processes are usually\nintroduced into the equations of magnetohydrodynamics as gross para\xc2\xad\nmeters to be determined by experiment. The mathematical accessibility\nof model kinetic equations in neutral and ionized gases, motivates the\nformulation of kinetic equations for a three-component plasma which\nincorporate the ionization process in this study. As a first attempt,\nonly the ionization processes resulting from electron-neutral collisions\nare considered. The resulting mathematical formalism yields a set of\nmodel equations which are mathematically not more complicated than\nthose for plasmas without consideration of ionization. The possible\napplication of the present model equations to various problems is\ndiscussed, such as the ionization growth in a gas, the cathode sheath,\nand the structure of an ionizing shock wave.\nReports and Publications\nThe following publications have been generated as a result of the\nresearch performed under this contract:\n1)\n\nAisenberg, S. and Rohatgi, V;\n"Measured Tangential Electrode Forces for an Arc in a Transverse\nMagnetic Field".

Anderson, (2)\n\nand A. B.\n\nambel\n\n(3)\n\nGas Dynamics Laboratory\n\nNorthwestern University\n\n\nIt has been shown that the incorporation of magnetic field coils in\xc2\xad\nspace vehicles offers interesting,possibilities in alleviating some of the\n\nproblems of space flight. For example, the coupling of the flow field with\n\na magnetic field has the salutory effect of increasing the drag experienced\n\nby an entry vehicle. Other promising applications of external magnetogas\xc2\xad\ndynamics are: the opening of communications windows, enhanced flexibility\n\nof maneuvers by virtue of flight control, active shielding against radiation,\n\nthe reduction of convective heat transfer and the elimination of the non\xc2\xad\nreusable heat shield. So far, such schemes have not been exploited due to\n\nhardware design limitations and due to the fact that current design philoso\xc2\xad\nphy has been successful in current programs. However, continuing progress\n\nin superconducting magnets and the demands of advanced space programs lend\n\npractical significance to equipping space vehicles with powerful electro\xc2\xad\nmagnets. The purpose of this program is to investigate this problem\n\nsystematically from both analytical and experimental viewpoints.\n\nA theoretical study was initiated in order to study and compare the\n\nfactors important in blunt body, flight magnetohydrodynamics and laboratory\n\nsimulation in the thermal arc plasma facility.\n\n\n-Consideration of the flow regimes indicates that assumptions of\n\ncontinuum flow, a Hugoniot shock, and sub-layers of viscous and sheath effects\'\n\nare valid for entry flight be-low 250 kilofeet. The assumptions of a iugoniot\n\nshock and thin boundary layer are considerably less valid for the laboratory\n\nconditions owing-to the low Reynolds numbers. Therefore, a viscous shock\n\nlayer was included in some of the analyses discussed below. Theoretical\n\n\n(1) \t\nGraduate Students\n\n(2) \t\nFaculty\n\n(3) \tChairman and Walter P. Murphy Professor of Mechanical Engineering and\n\nAstronautical Sciences.\n\n\n12\n\ndifficulties prevented including the shock structure, however.\n\nThe effects of viscosity, deformation of the magnetic field and the\n\nHall effect on the magnetic interaction were studied by the local similarity\n\nmethod for the stagnation region of aerodynamic - like flow. The flow\n\nobservables were found for a range of dimensionless parameters appropriate\n\nfor the flight and laboratory conditions.\n\nIt was found that the effect of low Reynolds number (laboratory flow)\n\nis very important for low magnetic interaction parameter but that a boundary\n\nlayer develops at high interaction. Thus, the outer flow becomes essentially\n\ninviscid for large Hartmann number similar to M1HD Poiseuille flow. The\n\neffect of the deformation of the magnetic Reynolds number was negligible for\n\nmagnetic Reynolds numbers up to an order of magnitude greater than that for\n\nunseeded, equilibrium plasma. \nHowever, an increase of an additional order\n\n(f magnitude resulted in the field being considerably distorted with a\n\nwrapping of flux lines about the body. The stand-off was decreased and the\n\ndrag increased for increasing magnetic Reynolds number. The analysis showed\n\nthat it is incorrect to assume that a dipole source looks like a dipole at\n\nthe body surface when there is distortion but that the assumption of a\n\n(reduced) dipole strength at the shock is valid. \nThe Hall effect is very\n\nimportant for flight and laboratory conditions with kilogauss field.strengths\n\nat the stagnation point. The magnetic interaction is reduced more so for\n\nan insulated body than a conducting one but the effect is important for\n\nboth. A rolling moment is introduced because of azimuthal flow generated\n\nby the Hall effect. All of the special effects tend to increase the critical\n\ninteraction parameter associated with magnetic support where the attached\n\n\nshock layer theory fails.\n\nExperimental investigations of magnetoaerodynamic drag have shown\n\nsubstantial (,15%) increase in drag with magnetic field. \nTests have been\n\nrun under a variety of flow conditions with both 1-1/2" and 3" bodies. In\n\ngeneral the experimental aerodynamic drag component agrees reasonably with\n\ntheoretical predictions. The measurements of drag with field for the 3"\n\nbody do not agree with prediction nearly so well as do those tests for the\n\n1-1/2" body. The main reason is the non-uniformity in free stream conditions\n\nwhich affect the 3" body more than the 1-1/2" body.\n\nExperimental values of drag increase are compared to theory for a\n\n,regime where the viscous and Hall effects are important. No theory exists\n\nfor the combined effects. The magnetic interaction parameter is obtained\n\nfrom experimentally measured quantities except for the electrical conducti\xc2\xad\nvity which is estimated from equilibrium calculations. We have found\n\nthat while drag appears to be greater under conditions where the Hall and\n\nviscous effects are lessened, the various data may be brought closer by\n\nplotting against the product of the interaction parameter and the shock\n\ndensity ratio. The remaining differences may be attributed to the Hall\n\neffect. Future work will include the measurements of different drag\n\ncomponents.\n\n\n13\nThe shock stand-off distance is plotted versus magnetic field squared.\n\nThese measurements were made by analyzing photographs of the flow using a\n\nscanning microdensitometer. We have found that the experimental measure\xc2\xad\niment is severely hampered by a thickened shock under our running conditions.\n\n\nNevertheless considerable alteration in the shock stand-off has been observed.\n\nPresent efforts include the measurements of electron density and temperature\n\nacross the shock structure spectroscopically in order to better define the\n\nshock stand-off distance.\n\n\nIn addition to the experimental drag studies, a program has been\n\ninitiated to experimentally determine magnetoaerodynamic heat transfer to\n\na blunt body. A thin shell, 3" diameter, hemispherical, copper model has\n\nbeen instrumented with thermocouples. In the presence of an argon plasma,\n\nthe local net transient heat transfer rate to the model is measured with and\n\nwithout the presence of a magnetic field. For a thin shell the heat\n\ntransfer rate to the model is proportional to the temperature - time rate\n\n(aT/dt) of the body if temperature gradients in the body are neglected.\n\nPreliminary results with a magnetic field strength of 7700 gauss at the\n\nstagnation point yield a 26% reduction in model centerline dT/dt. However,\n\ncorrections must be made to account for temperature gradients which do\n\nexist in the body during the test time.\n\nFuture tests will make possible the mapping of the magnetoaerodynamic\n\nheat transfer over the surface of the body (to half angles of 450) for a\n\nrange of magnetic field strengths of 8000 gauss and lower.\n\n\n.1.4\nPUBLICATIONS\n\n\n-Nowak, R., Kranc, S., Porter, R., Yuen, M.

Kuethe, University of Michigan\n\nA NASA grant on which work began March 1, 1966, covers experi\xc2\xad\nmental and theoretical studies of the properties and structure of a dc arc\nsuspended in mutually perpendicular electric, magnetic, and airflow\nfields. Previous work under an Air Force contract, in collaboration\nwith Charles E. Bond, showed 1) that the arc can be stabilized on rail\nelectrodes at a slant angle near the Mach angle of the flow, 2) that the\n"aerodynamic drag" of the arc changes with arc current in such a way\nthat the magnetic field required to stabilize the arc is constant over a\nwide range of the arc current, 3) column rather than root phenomena\ndetermine the conditions for arc stability, and other gross properties\n6f the arc.\nThe work under the NASA grant is being directed toward the\ndetails of the fluid mechanical structure of the arc and the transfer\nprocesses by which mass, momentum, and energy are transferred\nto the ambient flow.\nMeasurements to date indicate that, over the range of the\nmeasurements (Mach numbers up to 3. 5, ambient pressure down to\n10 mm Hg) the arc simulates a solid cylinder with a drag coefficient\nbetween 1. 0 and 1. 5 balancing the Lorentz force. The solid body\nhypothesis is based primarily on photographic observations of an axial\nflow from anode to cathode of about 10 meters/see in the Mach 2. 5 arc.\nIn addition to the axial flow, the incremental Lorentz force on any\nrelatively hot filament, C. e., higher conductivity and current density\nthan the surroundings) will force it upstream to the arc boundary where\nit will be cooled and carried downstream with the flow along the boundary.\nThis circulation will resemble that caused by a vortex pair, providing\nThus a model of the arc\nan upstreami flow toward the stagnation point.\n.in agreement with the measurements and physical reasoning is as follows:\nThe streamlines projected on a cross-section would resemble those of a\ndistributed source at the center, a vortex pair and a distributed sink at\nthe boundary.\nThe *ork will cover the widest possible range of Mach numbers,\nambient pressures, arc current and magnetic field. Wake traverses\nof gas properties will bemade. Theoretical analyses will include arc\nstability and transport phenomena.\n\n(a) View looking downstream\n\nElectrodes\n\n8"Diame te r,.7\n\n-\n\n..\n\nField Coil Location\n(b) View looking\'West\n\nFigure 2.

Hassan\n\nNorth Carolina State University\n\nRaleigh, North Carolina\n\n5sG-363\n\nAt the recent Fifth Electric Propulslon Conference a phenomenological\n\ntheory describing the WD arejet was presented by Bennett, John, Enos and\n\nTuchman I . The theory employs the concept of an effective mass flow rate 2\' 3\n\nand is based on the assumption that the-arc -discharge will operate at an\n\n-effective mass flow rate, me, which minimizes the arc voltage independent\n\nof the actual mass fiow rate passing through the device. As a result of\xc2\xad\nthis theory it is shown that, for mass flow rates greater or equal to be,\n\nthe maximum attainable velocity is limited by a critical velocity, Vt,\n\ngiven by ve = (21/m)1/2 where I is the ionization potential and inis the\n\nmass of the atom. For mass flow rates less than te the maximum velocity\n\ncan exceed v.. It appears that the concept of effective mass flow rate,\n\nwas introduced2 to explain-the existence of the voltage plateau which is,\n\ncharacteristic of rotating plasmas. Since it has been shown4\n 5 that an\n\n,\ninterpretation of\'this phenomenon can be obtained from a consideration of\n\nthe conservation equations,, the observed behavior of -the MPD arcet should\n\nbe explained without invoking any assumptions regarding the mass flow rate\n\nor the voltage.\n\nIt has been established experimentally and theoretically that the volt\xc2\xad\nagd has the representation V = Vo + CB where V. and C are constants depending \n\non the propellant-and B is the magnetic field strength. \nUsing this relation\n\nand the conservation equations, it is shown that there exists a critical\n\nmiss flow rate at which the thrust is maximum. In the absence of losses,\n\nthe efficiency at this -critical mass flow rate is 50% and,for mass flow\n\nrates less (or greater) than the critical mass flo4 rate, the\'efficiency\n\nis greater (or less) than 50%. \nThe critical mass flow increases with an\n\nincrease in total current and/or magnetic field strenth. This critical\n\nmass flow rate plays the same role played by fie of Ref. 1.\n\nAn experimental verification of the above theory requires thrust measure\xc2\xad\nments for a given total current and magnetic field strength for a range of\n\n.mass flow rates at low tank pressure. Such measurements were reported by\n\nBrockman, Hess, Bowen*and Jarrett 6 for various tank pressures. The figures\n\nshow a least-square fit of the data of Ref. 6 for low tank pressures. \n These\n\nfigures indicate the existence of an optimum mass flow rate which increases\n\nwith an increase in the total current and/or magnetic field strength in agre\n\nment with the predictions of the theory.\n\n-\n\n21\nReferences\n\n\n1\n\nBennett, S., et al.

Hassan\n\nNorth Carolina State University\n\nRaleigh, North Carolina\n\nNsG - 363\n\nExperimental investigation of instabilities in linear Hall current\xc2\xad\naccelerators with applied axial,electric fields and radial magnetic fields\xc2\xad\nshowed the existence of screw ype instabilitieslb 2 which show a striking\n\nresemblance to the instabilities observed in the positive column. Various\n\nattemptsl 2 have been made to apply the various- theories developed by\n\nKa\'domtsev and Nedospasov 3 , Simon4 , poh 5 and Morse 6 for the study of in\xc2\xad\nstabilities in the positive column and crossed field geometries to the\n\nlinear- Hall current accelerator, However, none of the above theories was\n\ndirectly applicable.\n\nBecause of the observed instability in the linear Hall current accelerator\nis similar to that obserged in the positive column, the governing equations\nemployed here are those normally employed in the study of weekly ionized gases.\nThese equations were also the basic equations employed in References 3-6. A\nnormal mode analysis similar to that employed by Johnson and Jerde 7 for the\npositive column has teen employed. It is shown that, regardless of the,direction\nof the density gradient, no screw type instability exist if it is assumed that\nthe axial magnetic field is identically zero. Since the driving mechanicpof\nthe, observed instability is an E x B drift the above result is expected because\na Ef component alone does not yield a radial drift component.\nSince the axial component of the magnetic field is small but never identi\xc2\xad\ncally zero in a linear,Hall cirrent accelerator, the analysis has been carried\n\nout for a magnetic field having both a radial and axial components. An exact\n\nsolution of the governing equations resulted in a density distribution with no\n\naxial or azimuthal dependance. This solution was expressed in terms of the\n\nconfluent hypergeometric function. Assuming that the perturbed density and\n\npotential have the general representation f(r) exp i ( wt + kz + mO) where W\n\nis the frequency and k is the wave number a general dispersion relation has been\n\nderived. The special case of a right handed helix (m = -1 mode) has been dis\xc2\xad\ncussed in detail and the results are presented graphically. The Figures show,\n\nplots of frequency, wave length, electric field for typical mobilities vs. the\n\ncritical value of Bz/B at the stability boundary. It is seen that the dimen\xc2\xad\nsionless parameter x. which depends on the ionization rate, radius of the device\n\nand radial and axial magnetic field strengths has a great influence on the stabil\n\nity; as the value of x. increase the discharge becomes more and more unstable.\n\nAs ,an illustration, the calculations show that the discharge is unstable for\n\nvalues of xo between 1.5 and 2.0 when 6 , the mobility ratio, is 10. This\n\nresult is somewhat interesting because the results of Ref. 1 indicate an onset\n\nof instability as soon as the magnetic field is switched on. The results alsQ\n\nshow that, at the stability boundary, the wave length is almost independent\n\nof the magnetic field strength except for a combination of high x. and B/B.\n\nAlso, an increase in Br promotes stability.\n\n\n25\n\nReferences\n\n1\n\n\nHess, R.

Spencer\n\nCase Institute of Technology\n\nCleveland, Ohio\n\n\nAn experimental investigation of shock waves moving through a highly\nionized gas is reported. The shock waves are generated in an electromagnetic\nT-tube. The ambient gas, helium, is highly preionized by means of an axial\ncurrent discharge with the shock waves being initiated during the after-glow\nperiod of the preionization. Measurements have shown that the plasma is in\nlocal thermal equilibrium and nearly completely ionized during the early\nafter-glow period of the preionization. Typical temperatures and electron\ndensities are in the order of 22,000 0 K and 3 x l016 electrons/cm 3 . Gasdyn\xc2\xad\nantic shock waves were studied and the results compared to the theory presented\nby Jaffrin and Probstein.* It was possible to verify the existence of, and\nquantitatively measure the thickness of the first layer, as predicted by\ntheir theory. Magnetohydrodynamic effects were studied via provision of an\naxial magnetic field. Magnetic field jumps and currents were observed in the\nshock front and found to be completely stable as long as the shock wave\ncould be observed. It was found that these effects did not appear if either\nthe applied magnetic field or preionization were absent.\n\n*Jaffrin, M. Y. and R. F. Probstein, Phys.

In order to achieve this ex\xc2\xad\ntremely wide bandwidth operation double ridge waveguide instruments, such\nas a balanced mixer, a directional coupler, a ridged-waveguide switch, two\n\ncoaxial to ridge adapters, and X and S-band to ridge waveguide transitions,\n\nhave been designed and developed. Difficulties have been encountered in\nachieving uniform frequency response of the balanced mixer due to matching\nT\nof mixer "E \' and "H" planes to the balanced anms. Aside from 4.5,- 5 KMC\nfrequency bandwidth, the radiometer has been calibrated in the range of\n2.6 to 9 EMC using argon and fluorescent noise sources. The radiometer sen\xc2\xad\nsitivity, equivalent to a minimum detectable temperature change of 1.6 0 K\n-has been computed.\nWith wide-band capability of this radiometer, electron cyclotron radi\xc2\xad\nation intensity measurements in a plasma have also been made by sweeping\n\nlocal oscillator of the radiometer from 2.6 to 9 KMC.\n\nThe radiometer is planned to be used in a series of investigations\n\ndealing with electron cyclotron harmonic generation in a plasma.\n\n\n32\nEXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE INTERACTION OF ENERGETIC ELETRON\n\nAND A PLASMA\n\nW.

The experiment was designed to produce data on single\n\nelectron interactions and not on beam-plasma effects. The experimental\n\naverage energy loss is observed to be larger than the theoretical prediction,\n\nindicating a minimum discrepancy of at least an order of magnitude between\n\ntheory and experiment. The theory includes the effects of binary collisions\nand collective interactions. The discrepancy probably is explained by the\nneglect in the theory of higher order terms in the plasma kinetic equations.\n-The experimental average energy loss and spread in energy are both found to\n1\n 2\n\nvary,proportional to the plasma electron density. ,\n\n\nReported in detail in:\n\n"A Measurement of.

Sosnowski"\n\nCase Institute of Technology\n\nCleveland, Ohio\n\n\nA laser method has been developed for the diagnostics of plasmas with\nelectron densities greater than about 1011 electrons/cm 3 . A spatial resol\xc2\xad\nution of about one microsecond, is calculated for the particular apparatus\nwhich has been used. The range of sensitivity corresponds favorably to that\nachieved by microwave methods, but the spatial resolution is much superior\nto that afforded by microwaves. The method depends on the detection of the\nshift in frequency of a laser when a plasma is introduced into the optical\ncavity.\nIf a cavity of length L.is employed to probe a plasma of length \xc2\xa3 in\xc2\xad\nternal to the cavity, then a frequency shift AV is expected which is given\nby\n2\n2\n2V\n\nW22 L -Lv r(nol)\n\n\xc2\xad\n\n(1)\n\nwhere w2\n = 4xne2/m is the square of the plasma frequency, v is the oscil\xc2\xad\n\nlatory Prequency of the laser, and no is the index of refraction of all other\nparticles in the plasma. To separate the effects of plasma, the frequency\nshift must be measured at two laser frequencies. Conveniently He-Ne lasers\n\noperate well at both 6328\nand 11,523 A. At the first wavelength, the ex\xc2\xad\npected plasma contribution for a density of 1011 electrons/cm 3 is 4.3 kc/s\nfor k/L = 1/2. Observed frequency shifts are about two orders of magnitude\nhigher, which shows the necessity for making the dual measurement. Fm de\xc2\xad\ntector techniques have been used with frequency differences up to about\n5 mc/s. For larger shifts, spectrum analyzer methods could be employed out\nto the limit of photomultiplier tubes. Thus these techniques complement\n\nboth microwave and other laser methods for the measurement of plasma electron\ndensities.\n\n\nExperimentally a system has been constructed which employs two \'laser\ncavities; one laser serves as the probe and the other the "local oscillator"\nlaser. Each of the lasers is isolated optically and electronically but\ncoupled together mechanically to assist in the cancellation of mechahical\nand thermal drifts. The output beams from each laser are made to coalesce\nby a beam splitter and are allowed to illuminate the surface of a photo\xc2\xad\nmultiplier. Two channels are thus available to nike measurements simultan\xc2\xad\neously at the two wavelengths, 6328 A and 11,523 A. Using these techniques\nand others to be described in the paper, excellent overall system stability\nhas been achieved in standard laboratory surroundings. Beat frequencies of\n\xc2\xb1 150 kc/s for at least three minutes. The forn r corresponds to a stability\nof the total optical path length to about \xc2\xb1 0.1 A. Short-term stability\nmeasurements therefore show that plasmas in the order of 1011 electrons/cm3\ncan be probed. Experimental data on argon discharge tubes will be presented.\n\n34\nIt is felt that with a better environment that it should be possible to in\xc2\xad\nprove on this stability by an order of magnitude.\n\n*Also published in:\nJournal of Quantun Electronics, April, 1966, Vol. QE-2, Paper 8C-8 Pg. lx.\n\n35\n\nTURBULENCE IN A RAREFIED PLASMA\n\n\nC.

In\n\nthese collisionless plasmas the usual collisional dissipative mechanisms \n are\nabsent and the dynamics of such plasmas are completely different from the\n\ndynamics of a fluid. \nAmong the most basic properties of a collisionless plasmas\n\nfrom a theoretical point of view, are those embodied in the dispersion relations\n\nwhich determine the \ncharacter of the waves which can propagate in the plasma.\nIf any of these waves are unstable, they grow to some limit determined by the\n\nnon-linear theory of plasma dynamics, \n and the wave spectrum in \t the final state\n.(i.e., the turbulent end-result of the growth) determines many of the plasma\n\nproperties of practical interest. \n Forexample, the transport properties, the\n\nmicrowave scattering cross section, and the equilibrium density in a contain\xc2\xad\n2\n\ning field (e.g., the earth s magnetic field) are likely to be dominated by the\n\nturbulence of the plasma.\n\nThe dynamics of a collisionless plasma is described by the collisionless\nThese equations, com\xc2\xad\nBoltzmann equation combined with MIxwell\'s equations.\nbined with the definition of charge and current, constitute a complete set of\n\nequations and thus, if boundary conditions are specified, are in principle a\n\ncomplete description of the collective motions of the plasma. \n However, the\n\na\nequations are non-linear \tnd cannot be integrated directly. To obtain solutions\n\nthe set of equations .is usually linearized by investigating the effect of a\nusing perturbation theory. By\nstate, \n i.e.,\nsmall disturbance on some initial\ncarrying the perturbation theory to second order ("quasi-linear theory") a\n\ndescription of the turbulence resulting from the wave growth is obtained, and\n\nfrom what amounts to a third order calculation, the ultimate dissipation of\n\nthe turbulence is predicted. Experimental confirmation of the theory is al\xc2\xad\nmost completely lacking, partly because it has only recently\'been possible to\n\nmake laboratory plasmas which match the assumptions of the theory.\n\nProgress and Results\n\nThe principal theoretical effort in the program has been devoted to de\xc2\xad\nveloping the theoretical techniques necessary for\'the application of the linear\ntheory of plasma waves to the geometries ehcountered experimentally, where the\nsize is finite, and the density a function of position. In particular, methods\nhave been developed for predicting the dispersion and damping of electron\ncyclotron waves in, the geometry of the turbulence machine from first principles.\nThe turbulence machine at General Atomic (developed under other programs)\n\nprovides a quiescent, collisionless plasma which matches the assumptions of the\n\ntheory. Included in the installation are a variety of highly developed ,diagnos\xc2\xad\ntic instruments for wave propagation experiments. Many of the plasma properties\n\nare known in detail from other experiments. Using this facility, the propaga\xc2\xad\ntion of waves near the electron cyclotron frequency has been investigated. The\n\ndispersion and damping of the waves has been measured, and their growth due to\n\nan electron beam injected into the plasma has been observed. Some of the \n\nwaves are wave-guide modes perturbed by the plasma. The wave of most interest\n\nfor these measurements is electron cyclotron wave. This is a backward wave\n\nwhich propagates between the cyclotron frequency and the upper hybrid frequeney.\n\nThe measurements have been made for a variety of .plasmaparameters.\n\nAddition of a cusp magnetic field to the usually uniform magnetic field\n\nnear the plasma source reduces the anomalous diffusion of the plasma by an\n\norder of magnitude. We hypothesize that this geometry decreases random electrfc\n\nfields in the plasma by reducing communication with the source, and thus re\xc2\xad\nsults in reduced diffusion.\n\nFuture Plans\n\nWe intend to continue the investigation of the waves. We want to com\xc2\xad\npare the observed dispersion relations with theory using independently measured\n\nplasma properties in the theory for comparison. The damping measurements\n\nneed better precision, and much better growth data would be desirable. After\n\nthe dispersion, damping,\nand linear growth of these waves is measured and\n\ncompared to theory, the next step along the road to.understanding the ultimate\n\nturbulence and diffusion associated with them is to investigate the non-linear\n\nlimit of their growth. Further measurements will also be made to establish\n\nwhether our hypothesis on how the cusp field reduces diffusion is correct.\n\nReferences\n\nC. B. Wharton and J. H. Malmberg, Bull. Am. Phys.

A. Huchital and E. H. Holt\n\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N.Y.\n\nWe have carried out a systematic experimental study on the modes of\n\nthe Kadomtsev instability of a collision dominated magnetoplasma which has\n\nresulted in new information and understanding concerning the presence and\n\ndominance of the separate modes, m = 0, m = 1 and m = 2.\n\nAnomalous effects were reported by Lehnert 1 to appear when a longitudinal\nmagnetic field, BL, impressed on a dc positive column exceeded a critical\n\nvalue, B .. The onset of these effects was explained by the stability con\xc2\xad\nsiderations of Kadomtsev and Nedospasov2 who showed that a helical perturbation\n\nof the form J(Or) exp(imt + ikz + int) will grow exponentially when BL> Bc\nL\n1.\nand m\nWe have studied the plasma with Langmuir probes to determine the rela\xc2\xad\ntive importance of the various possible modes.3 We have used sets of four\nprobes inserted 900 apart to measure azimuthal phase relations. A typical\n\nresult is shown in Figure 1. The 900 phase difference between the two signals\n\nverifies the presence of the m = 1 mode.\n\nOur investigations have included the interesting observation that an\nm = 0 class of oscillation is commonly present in the plasma. This new result\ncannot be explained on the basis of the Kadomtsev theory. Data will be\npresented to show that the m = 0 oscillation vanishes when the electric\nfield in the column is precisely aligned with the main magnetic field.\nTransverse components of magnetic field as small as 0-5 gauss are sufficient\nto generate m = 0 oscillations of appreciable amplitude. Experimental and\ntheoretical results will be presented to show that the m = 0 oscillation is\nan important non-linear effect resulting from the interaction of the helical\n\nm = 1\n\nmode with the transverse magnetic field.\n\n\nWhen the transverse magnetic field is increased to the order of several\ntens of gauss, the m - 2 mode is observed to become the dominant oscillation.\nHowever, the experiment is incapable of distinguishing between a genuine\n\nm = 2 instability and a non-linear effect similar to that associated with\n\nm = 0. We have developed a new experimental technique4 that considers the\nresponse of the plasma to externally impressed perturbations while the magneto\xc2\xad\nplasma is operating in the sub-critical (BL < Bc) regime.\nFigure 2 shows the signal detected at probe set B as a function of\nthe frequency of the source connected to probe set A. It is shown that as\nthe critical magnetic field of 2100 gauss is approached a distinct resonance\n\nrepresentative at the m = 1 instability is excited. Experimental results\nobtained by this technique will be presented to establish the independence\n\nof the m = 2 instability and to confirm the non-linear nature of the m = 0\nmode.\n\n45\nI. B.

Noon, P.R. Blazuk, E.H. Holt\n\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy N.Y.\n\n\nA gated microwave radiometer1 and a specially constructed magnetoplasma\n\n\nwaveguide cell 2 have been used in this laboratory to monitor the radiation\n\ntemperature of electrons in an afterglow plasma and to examine departures\n\nfrom a Maxwellian electron veloqity distribution. The cell is also suitable\n\n3\na\nfor \t study of anomalous diffusion in a pulsed magnetoplasma, or for measur\xc2\xad\nfor plasma instability,\n\nn\ning \t oise radiation near the critical magnetic field\nalthough these measurements have not as yet been carried out.\n\n4 5 \n\nMicrowave radiometers have been used by a number of workers , to detect\n\nt\nthe \t hermal noise radiation from qlectrons in a collision-dominated nitrogen\n\nplasma and thus to determine the electron temperature, assuming a Maxwellian\n\nelectron velocity distribution exists in the plasma. This assumption is not\n\nnecessarily valid always as shown by our results which are reported below. If\n\na- longitudinal magnetic field is applied, measurement of the noise power from\np\nthe \t lasma, as a function of magnetic field, for a range of field strength\n\nsuch that the electron cyclotron frequency is close to the microwave observa\xc2\xad\n6\ntional frequency, may be analyzed to determine departures from a Maxwellian\n\ndistribution. A sample of our experimental results in a nitrogen discharge\n\nshowing noise radiation temperature as a function of applied magnetic field,\n\nshown in Figure 1, and distribution function parameters giving best fit\nare \t\nto the data are shown in Figure 2. These results show clearly that for a\n\nshort time after the cessation of the pulsed DC discharge the nitrogen after\xc2\xad\nglow is relatively rich in high energy electrons, then becomes deficient in\n\nhigh energy electrons, then relaxes back to a Maxellian distribution. This\n\nalso manifests itself as an apparent \'maximum in the radiation temperature, at\npost-discharge times of order 25 microseconds, and by a relatively slow rate\n\nat which the electrons relax back to room temperature. The magnitude of both\n\nthese effects depends somewhat on the energy input into the discharge as shown\n\n.in Figure 3. Time resolved studies of the active discharge itself have also\n\nbeen carried out and it appears that a time of the order of 10 microseconds\n\nafter application of the DC voltage to the electrodes is required before a\n\nMaxwellian electron velocity distribution exists in the nitrogen discharge.\n\n\nThese results can be used both to provide information about energy loss\n\nprocesses in the plasma and also to indicate the regime in which the magneto\xc2\xad\nplasma becomes unstable above a critical magnetic field.\n\nFurther measurements planned with the magnetoplasma cell will be outlined.\n\'*Work supported by NASA\nunder grant no.\n\nNsG 48.\n\n1. \tW.

NHsG-k15\nThe purposes of the research have been to make basic measurements\nof the properties of very dense plasmas and to check the accuracy of\ntheories which might be applicable to a description of these plasmas.\nMeasurements of temperatuire, pressure, resistivity, \n and energy density\nThe\n\nwere obtained in the range of pressures from 3 to 120 kilobars.\nstudies of plasma was\n\nDebye shielding theory often used for theoretical\nfound to be very inadequate at these high \'pressures.\nlthough high density plasmas occur in various experiments involv\xc2\xad\nhas\ning exploding \'wires and hypervelocity guns, for example, little\nof the\nE.

From mea\xc2\xad\nsurements of radiation intensity, measurements of the electrical dis\xc2\xad\ncharge characteristics, and photographs, the desired data -was computed.\nThe pressure was a function of the rate of current rise in the column\nof plasma formed by the discharge. In the second phase, the discharge\n\nwas formed in water which had been compressed by a chemical explosive\nThe data was recorded similarly and -varia\xc2\xad\nto 100 kilobars of pressure.\ntions of pressure from 100 to 120 kilobars also depended upon the rate\nof current rise.\nThe diameter of the discharge column and the current flowing\nthrough the column increase nearly linearly with time. As the column\ngrows, energy is supplied from the discharge circuit so as to maintain\nLikewise the other in\xc2\xad\na nearly constant energy density in the plasma.\ntensive properties of the plasma are nearly constant \n with time. Energy\nlost from the plasma through expansion against its surroundings and,\n\nthrough radiation is a small fraction of the total energy supplied \nto\n\nthe plasma- The best data are taken late in the interval of observa\xc2\xad\ntion -when the variables are in the most accurate ranges of the instru\xc2\xad\nmentation, that is in the interval from 0.8 to 1.0 lisec,\nThe magnetic pinch effect is important in the calculation of pres\xc2\xad\nsure. For a uniform radial current distribution the pinch pressure\nvaries from zero at the boundary of the discharge to a peak on the cylin\xc2\xad\nof\ndrical axis. The Volume average of the pinch pressure which is half\n\n49\nthe peak is added to pressure produced by the inertial restraint of the\nwater surrounding the column to obtain total pressure.\nSince the resis\xc2\xad\ntivity of the plasma has been found to decrease with increasing pressure,\nthe radial pressure gradient tends to concentrate current at the center,\n\ncausing an even greater pinch than has been estimated.\nWithout exeption, the temperatures of the plasmas formed without\nexplosives were about 35 000\xc2\xb0K while the temperatures with explosives\nwere about 10 000K. The variations with pressure of the energy density\nu and the resistivity p are plotted in Fig. I and Fig. 2;\nA system of equations based upon the Debye shielding theory was\nused to predict particle density and energy density from temperature\nand pressure for the case without explosive.\nThe predicitions of energy\ndensity were found to be about one-fifth of the measured values while\nthe measurements are considered accurate to within 20 percent.\nThe\nfailure of the Lebye theory was not surprising because the Debye radius\nwas smaller than the average interparticle spacing. In place of the\n\nDebye theory, a semiquantitative theory based upon the distortion of\nelectron quantum levels was found to provide a much better explanation\nof the energy density measurements.\nFor the case -with explosive, the\nDebye theory predicted an unreasonably low level of ionization because\nof the low temperature, and the analysis was not carried further. The\nconcept of excluded volume was introduced into calculations for the\nhigher pressure. From the theoretical considerations the density of\n\natoms for a 100 kilobar plasma was estimated to be 10 3cm-S and for a\n7 kilobar plasma to be 10 2 2 cm-3.\n\nPublications\n\n\nRobinson, James W.: Measurement and Interpretation of .Plasma Properties\nto 100 Kilobars of Pressure,\nTo be published as a NASA Contractor\nReport, CR-446.\nRobinson, James W.: Plasma Measurements at 100 Kilobars, of Pressure.\nAppl.

Schneider\n\nDepartment of Nuclear Engineering Sciences\n\nUniversity of Florida\nABSTRACT\nThe program to be reported started on May 1, 1966; therefore,\nit is necessarily still in the planning stage. However, preliminary\nexperiments for orientation purposes have been made. The program is\naimed to make a contribution to the understanding of the mechanism\nof the high voltage vacuum breakdown. Special emphasis is placed on\nthe mechanism of material release from the electrodes. It is desir\xc2\xad\nable to find means to predetermine the material release, and perhaps\ninitiate it by magnetic ignition. The information obtained should\nbe useful for electric propulsion using metal plasmas.\n\xc2\xad\n\nThe measurements will be made in a vacuum as low as 10-10\n\nTorr. The electrode configuration will be parallel plates for\n\nelectrode conditioning and repeatability tests. Other configura\xc2\xad\ntions are planned to favor or suppress one or more of the many pro\xc2\xad\ncesses which take part in the vacuum breakdown. These processes\n\nare (1) electron frees positive ion at the anode, (2) photon frees\n\nelectron on the cathode, (3) electron frees photon on the anode,\n\n(4) positive ion frees electron at the cathode, (5) negative ion\n\nfrees positive ion at the anode. Using appropriate electrode con\xc2\xad\nfigurations, with auxiliary electrostatic or magnetic fields, it\n\nshould be possible to suppress or enhance some of these processes\n\nin order to study their influence on the mechanism of the vacuum\n\nbreakdown.\n\nSpectroscopic studies of the inter-electrode plasma are\n\nplanned. The object is to determine the temperature, density and\n\nionization degree of the material released from the electrode. In\n\norder to do this, methods of short-time spectroscopy have to be\n\napplied. The discharge time is in the order of 1 sec. or shorter.\n\nTherefore, it is worthwhile to investigate whether the inter-electrode\n\nplasma has a defined temperature. Our point of interest will be to\n\nfind out if the material released from the electrodes is released in\nthe form of ions or if it is released as atom vapor by thermal vapora\xc2\xad\ntion, or if it is released in larger units (clumps) by mechanical\n\nstress or impact.\n\nTime integrated spectroscopy can be used to determine how\n\nmuch material from whidh electrode is released. This will be aided\n\nby making anode and cathode of different materials.\n\n\n52\n\nSome results of the preliminary experiments will be shown\n\nat the meeting.\n\n\n53\n\nSYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION\n\nOF MAGNETIC FLUIDS\n\nE.E. Rosensweig\nAvco Corporation\nResearch and Technology Laboratories\nWilmington, Massachusetts\n\nIn the present research program we endeavor to synthesize fluids\n\nhaving a strong magnetic response, and to characterize their properties\n\nand discover the laws and relationships which govern their response to\n\nan applied magnetic field.\n\nBackground Information\n\nAll known materials that are strongly, magnetic like iron--the\nferromagnetic metals, alloys and compounds--are solids. While theore\xc2\xad\nticians do not rule out the possibility of true ferromagnetic liquids,\n\nnone is known at present. It is, however, possible to make a stable\n\nsuspension of a finely divided ferromagnetic solid in a carrier liquid,\n\nto produce a fluid that reacts strongly when a magnetic field is applied\n\nto it, and we are engaged in studies of such fluids.\n\nThe pressure distribution in these fluids can be independently\n\ncontrolled by an applied magnetic field. The fluid response then takes\n\nseveral basic forms\', opening up a wide range of possibilities in viscous\n\ndampers, inertial sensors, heat engines, fluid computers, fluid\n\nmodelling studies, medical technology, and other technological area..\n\nInvestigation of the basic fluid mechanical processes which\n\ngovern the response of a magnetizable fluid to a source of magnetic\n\nfield leads to an augmented Bernoulli principle in which a magnetic\n\npressure-like term is additive to the usual pressure, speed, and\n\ngravitational terms.\n\nH\n\np +\nq2 +\ngh Id = constant\n\n0\nThe various terms in this eguation along with \'consistent c.g.s. units\nare, p = pressure (dynes/cm2), e = density, assumed .constant (gm./c.c.),\nq = speed (cm./sec.), h = elevation (cm.), I = magnetic moment per unit\n\nvolume (pole-cm.) = M/41r where M is expressed in gauss (M = B-H), and\nH = applied field (oersteds). The initial three terms taken in various\ncombinations describe fluid mechanically a number of familiar techno\xc2\xad\nlogical processes as categorized in an accompanying figure. The\nmagnetic.term then combines to yield additional classes of fluid\ndynamic and static phenomena laden with possibilities for technological\napplication. These furnish a portion of the motivation for these\nstudies.\n\n54\nProgram Activities\nMuch of the work under the program has concentrated on the\npreparation and study of magnetic fluids composed of ferrite solid\nparticles dispersed in an organic liquid. The carrier fluids are\nchosen on the basis of viscosity, chemical nature, and boiling point.\nDispersants are selected on the theory that a suitable molecular\nand a polar end group.\nstructure contains a chainlike nonpolar tail\nBoth magnetite and a lower Curie temperature, manganese zinc ferrite\nare used as the solid, magnetic constituent. Dispersion"into colloidal\n\nform is accomplished by wet ball milling of the -solid material in the\n\npresence of the carrier liquid and the dispersant.\n\nScreening tests are conducted to determine systems that lead to\nsuccessful production of colloid. Then study is made of the effects\n\nthe\ncharge and the grinding time on the formation of colloid and\nof initial\nThe successful fluids are characterized by their\nits physical nature.\nproperties of magnetism, viscosity, temperature dependence of viscosity,\n\ndensity, stability, and particle size and shape. The fluids are\nmodified by vacuum distillation or addition of solvents and study is\nmade of the modified fluids so obtained.\nCorrelations are studied of the inter-relationship between the\nvarious measured properties and known parameters such as dispersant\nchain length and attempt is made to feed back this information into the\nsynthesis of additional fluids having accented properties.\nPresentation of Results\nStable magnetic fluids are produced in which the typical parti\xc2\xad\nThe number of colloidal particles per cubic\ncle size is 100 angstroms.\nis enormous, and characteristically ranges from l0 1 5 to 1020.\ncentimeter\nOleic and linoleic acids have proven successful as dispersing agents and\nso has another class of dispersants consisting of succinic acid deriva\xc2\xad\ntives. Fluids prepared in this manner are strongly attracted to a\nmagnet and volumes of the fluid may be suspended against the force of\ngravity. The magnetic particles experience a constant attraction in\nthe direction of an applied field gradient but at the same time are\nfree to move through the fluid, hence the persistence of a stable sus\xc2\xad\npension requires explanation. It is believed that at equilibrium the\nterminal motion of the particles equals the diffusional transport of\n\nparticles due to a (small) concentration gradient. Then the stable\n\ndiameter d is less than the value computed from\n\n\n\n\nd3 = 24\n\nk\n\n\nwhere k = Boltzmann\'s constant = 1.38 x 10-16 erg/particle OK, T =\nabsolute temperature in Kelvin unit, M = ferric induction in gauss,\nH = applied field in oersted, and s is length--d is then given in\ncentimeters.\n\nSuspended in the fluid each particle is analogous to a molecule\nof a pranmagnetic gas. The Langevin equation of statistical mechanics\nthe average magnetic moment per particle averaged 6ver\nthen relates\nall thermaLlv induced orientations to -) the true magnetic moment of a\n\n55\nparticle, H the applied field, and T the temperature. Unlike a para\xc2\xad\nmagnetic gas molecule, for a particle of the magnetic fluid ) = -(T).\nAn extended form of the equation has been obtained to deal with the\nactual particle size distribution function.\n\nThe experimentally determined dependence of viscosity upon the\n\nloading is correlated with theoretical predictions. The earliest\n\ntheory was derived by Einstein who solved the flow field of pure\n\nstrain as perturbed by the presence of a sphere. His result relates\n\nmixture.viscosity )sto solvent viscosity , and solids fraction\n:\n\n7S 1 + 2.5\n.\nHowever, this relationship is valid only for dilute colloidal mixtures;\n\na better expression, correct for high solids loadings, has the form:\n\n\nVt0\n\n1-2.5 0 + 1.55#2\n\nThis relationship predicts solidification corresponding to spheres in\n\nthe hexagonal close-packed arrangement. In using this relationship,\nthe thickness 9 of the monolayer coating on each particle must be con\xc2\xad\nsidered in the computation of +\nAnother important consideration is the prevention of particle\n\nagglomeration or flocculation. The important mechanisms are the mag\xc2\xad\nnetic forces and van der Waal\'s attractions (which tend to flocculate)\n\nand repulsion forces arising from deformation of an adsorbed layer of\n\ndispersing agent. The energies of two adjacent particles are found to\n\nbe:\n\n2 V 2\n\n-2\nMagnetic energy: \n Em =\n\nVan der Waal\'s:\n(London\'s model) \n\n\nEL =\n\nAF 2+h\n[2\n6\n\n+\n\n2 2\n\n\n2+i\n(h2)\n\nNk (1\n\nh2+4\n\nh +4\n\n(h 2)2]\n\n\nhr < 1\n\n\nEntropic repulsion: ER =\n\n0 "hr>1\n\n\n2Z\'\n\n\n1\n\n\nWhere N is the number of adsorbed molecules per unit area, S is the\nlength of the hydrocarbon chain, and h is the relative separation of\nparticle surfaces, h = H/r where H = surface to surface separation.\nFor stability against flocculation the three energies must\nproduce a superimposed energy distribution having a barrier or energy\nhump at least several times greater than kT, the thermal energy of a\nparticle.\n\n56\n\nAt the beginning of this program, magnetic fluid with viscosity\n\nless than ten centipoise was limited to a ferric induction at satu\xc2\xad\nration of little more than 100 gauss. The relationship between vis\xc2\xad\ncosity and ferric induction is presented ii the accompanying figure\n\nwhich also illustrates the advance in the state of the art. \nFluid is\n\nnow produced whose ferric induction exceeds 1000 gauss. The remaining\n\nfigure presents data that permits correlation of the initial perme\xc2\xad\nability of the fluids with the ferric induction at saturation, Ms.\n\naccording to\n\n(I +M\n\nS)\n\n>\n\n100 gauss\n\nThis tells that the present fluids yield permeabilities in the range\n<\n1 <A, 3 which, although it is extraordinarily large compared to the\npereabilities of normal liquids, is still rather small compared to the\npermeabilities of solid ferromagnetic materials. \nThe obtaining of\n\nstable magnetic fluids having a much greater permeability is one of a\n\nnumber of challenging problems in this work where the solution in\n\nprobability depends upon an understanding of surface physics and\n\nchemistry, magnetostatics, and the behavior of matter in general.\n\nBackground References\n\nRosensweig; R.E., Nestor, J.W., and Timmins, R.S., "Ferrohydrodynamic\n\nFluids for Direct Conversion of Heat Energy" A.I.Ch.E.-I.

AND DISPERSION OF HYDROMAGNETIC AND\nION CYCLOTRON WAVES IN PLASMAS IMMERSED IN MAGNETIC FIELDS*\nProfessor Arwin A. Dougal, The University of Texas,\'Austin\n\n78712\n\nThe long range challenges for exploration and exploitation of space, requires\nthat ever increasing, technological and scientific attention be given towards the\nrealization of extremely light, almost infinitely long-lived, and efficient power\nsources. Within. kery recent years the technological community has recognized\nthe vast potential power production realizable from the fusion products of reacting\nlight nuclei as the ultimate source. Almost overwhelming power output per unit\nfuel mass is afforded by the reacting light nuclei. Two milliofn kilowatt hours of\nenergy are forseen to be extractable through fusion of as little as 0.06 pounds of\ndeuterium nuclei. An immense technological problem to be overcome is the require\xc2\xad\nment for the production and heating of deuterium ions in the gaseous plasma state\nto several hundred million degrees temperature to which this research work and its\ncontinuation are addressed. Experimental and analytical findings from our recent\nresearch work on ion cyclotron resonance heating show definite promise towards\nfuture realization of increasingly super-high ion temperatures. These findings are\nsupported by relatively recent reports from those few research groups throughout\nthe world who have\'had the foresight to initiate studies on ion cyclotron resonance\nheating and to realize the major experimental facility for effective experimentalwork.\nMost earlier and existing attempts to elevate plasma temperatures into the\ndesired range have resulted in high electron temperatures but relatively low ion\ntemperatures which re inadequate. Both theory and experiment have recently con\xc2\xad\nfirmed\' that effective heating, propagation, and dispersion of.ion cyclotron waves\nin plasmas immersed in magnetic fields are possible. Dekosition of power into L\nplasma through radio frequency fields at an angular frequency CO requires con\xc2\xad\nsideration of characteristic frequencies associated with the plasma and its magnetic\nfield configuration. The characteristic frequency .1_Z of an ion in a magnetic\nwhere qi and mi are the ionic charge and\nX\nfield is given by .2-t\nmass respectively. Theory and experiments show that effective heating of plasma\nions occurs through ion cyclotron wave interactions.\nExperimental research on ICRH has been performed by research groups at NASALewis, Princetbn University, Lawrenpe Radiation Laboratory at the University of Cal\xc2\xad\nifornia at Berkeley, Physicotechnical Institute at Khar\'kov USSR, The University of\nTexas, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Institute of Plasma Physics\nat Nagoya University, Japan.\nThe experimental arrangement at ,The University of Texas is shown in Fig. 1.\nBoth\'hydrogen and/or deuterium gas can be leaked into the plasma tube;\n\nThe vacuum\n\n*Sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Grant NsG-353.\n\n61\n-\n\nbase pressure is better than 10 8 torr, VacSorb and VacIon pumps are used in\norder to reduce impurities in the system. The overall length of the magnetic field\ncoil system is presently 150 cm. Rf power is coupled into the plasma through a\nFaraday shielded "Stix" coil located in a uniform field region of maximum 10.6 kG.\nA "magnetic beach" region on one side of the "Stix" coil is used for wave propa\xc2\xad\ngation studies. Maximum incident rf power is presently over 30 kW. The incident\nand reflected rf power is measured with adjustable, calibrated directional couplers.\nThe rf dfiver is crystal controlled at 5.8 MHz. A 27 MHz, 1 kW, preionizer is\nused in all experiments. A fairly extensive study of the design of the "Stix" coil\nand associated electrostatic shields was undertaken. The present coil and shield\ncombination gives an Be field which is almost sinusoidally varying in the axial\ndirection and an Ez field which is substantially reduced. The number of coil turns\nand their relative spacing was determined using a digital computer. The Faraday\nshield consists of 9 strips of copper, .020" thick by 0.5" wide along the discharge\ntube under the Stix coil.\n\nA new and previously unreported wave phenomenon was observed in this ex\xc2\xad\nperimental investigation of ion cyclotron resonance heating of hydrogen and deute\xc2\xad\nrium plasmas. For certain gas pressures the ion cyclotron waves propagate for\nfrequency (f) greater than the ion cyclotron frequency (fi), and attenuate at har-\'\nmonics of the ion cyclotron frequency with a resulting increase in the transverse\ntemperature-density product (nKT1 ). In this experimental investigation the fre\xc2\xad\nquency (f) of the driver was kept constant and the other parameters, such as gas\npressure and magnetic field strength, were varied. Decreasing the magnetic field\nstrength is effectively the same as increasing the frequency of the driver (f), and\nvice versa. The wave magnetic field components were measured with movable,\nshielded, magnetic probes located near the end of the magnetic beach.\nFor low hydrogen pressures (p < 2 millitorr) an ion cyclotron wave was observed\nto propagate for B - Bc , where Bc is the ion cyclotron resonance magnetic field for\nthe driver frequency (f). The ion cyclotron wave was observed to attenuate quite\nsharply near B = Bc as expected. As the gas pressure was increased, a wave was\nobserved to propagate for B < B., which was unexpected. Closer investigation re-,\nvealed that the wave attenuates near B/N\' where N is an integer. Thus, the wave\npropagates for f ;f (the ion cyclotron frequency) and attenuates at harmonics of fh.\ni\nwas found to depend upon the gas pressure such that N,increased\nThe value of N\nfor higher pressures. The same general effects were observed in-deuterium plasmas.\nIn deuterium, the effects are more pronounced since the separations between the\nvarious Bc/N are larger due to the larger deuterium ion mass. Fig. 2 shows these\neffects as measured in a deuterium plasma. The region of abrupt wave attenuation\nmoves to lower magnetic fields as the gas pressure increases. The attenuation\nregions are very close to the harmonic resonance fields.\nThe question arises whether the observed wave field attenuation of harmonics\nof fi is, due to a wave cut off or to actual wave damping near the critical fields. Dia\xc2\xad\nmagnetic probe measurements indicate that the waves are damped and that energy is\ntransferred from the waves to the plasma particles. Additional measurements on\n\n62\nwave propagation and wave attenuation are in progress.\nation for these observed effects is being developed.\n\nAn analytical explan\xc2\xad\n\nPublications\n\n1. \t\n\nA.

Magnetoacoustic waves are distur\xc2\xad\nbances which propagate in a conducting gas at velocities greater\n\nthan the sound speed in the medium. This greater propagation velo-\xc2\xad\ncity is due to currents which are induced through the compression\n\nof magnetic field lines within the conductor. These currents\n\ninteract with the applied magnetic field to produce forces which\n\naid compressional forces.\n\nThe proposed generator is shown in Figure 1, in which the\n\ncoils of an artificial transmission line are coupled to thq mag\xc2\xad\nnetic field B associated with the waves in a convecting plasma.\n\nFor a velocity V greater than the magnetoacoustic velocity, there\n\nwill be.two forward waves in the gas.

Robertson, Department of Physics,\n\nUniversity of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida\n\n\nSelf-excited oscillations in otherwise quiescent cesium\n\narcs have been found to originate at the anode surface.\n\nThese oscillations appear to he similar to those observed\n\nin cesium ,diodes and in Q-rachines with ion-rich sheaths.\n\nThe suggestion that the oscillations in cesium diodes might\n\nprovide a means for direct conversion of thermal to a.c.\n\npower on the one \n\nhand, and the experimental evidence that\n\nsome of the instabilities seen in Q-machines originate in\n\nthe anode sheath have motivated the study of these oscilla\xc2\xad\ntions in an experimental facility that permits a variety\n\nof observations.\n\nThe experimental facility consists of a pyrex discharg\n\ntube with (usually) a thermionic cathode, usually about 30cm\n\nfrom. one or more \n\nof a variety of anode structures. A cesium\n\nreservoir in its own oven determines the vapor pressure, and\n\nthe discharge tube is operated in a transparent pyrex fur\xc2\xad\nnace at a temperature usually 500 C or more above that of the\n\nreservoir. The neutral cesium pressure may be varied from\n\n3\n\nabout 10 -\n Torr to 1 Torr; the current from a few milli\xc2\xad\namperes to 2 ampere; the electron temperature is a few tenths\n\nof i eV, and the fractional ionization in the plasma is\n\nusually less than 1%. \n Anodes may be plane, cylindrical, or\n\nspherical, and multiple anodes recessed in cylindrical pyrex\n\ntubes are sometimes used. \n\'Both rubidium and potassium have\n\nbeen studied, but the most extensive work has been in cesium.\n\nOscillation amplitudes may be \n\nas high as several volts,\n\nand periods vary from a few-microseconds to a few milli\xc2\xad\nseconds. Photoelectric observations of the emitted light\n\nshows that the oscillations are localized to the region with\xc2\xad\nin a few millimeters of the anode surface.\n\nTheoretical and experimental analyses -lead to the follow\xc2\xad\ning qualitative understanding of the phenomenon. Neutral\n\natoms incident on the anode surface are \n\nionized because the\n\nwork function of the anode is greater than the ionization\n\npotential of the atom, but they are \n\nlightlytbbund to the\n\nanode surface by image forces. A rising electric field at\n\nthe anode results in a burst of emitted ions from the surface,\n\naccompanied by release 6f electrons from the sheath\' edge to\n\nmaintain neutrality. \n The resulting enhanced *conductivity of\n\nthe anode sheath leads to an abrupt fall in tube volts and\n\n\n71\n\nlocal electric field, while the locally increased ion on\n\nelectron densities lead to a sharp increase in the emission\n\nof both recombination radiation and excitation radiation.\n\nThen, as the burst of ions- and electrons dissipates, prin\xc2\xad\ncipally by diffusion and conduction, but in part by-recom\xc2\xad\nDuring the low\xc2\xad\nbination, the electric field begins to rise.\nfield part of the cycle, more neutrals have been absorbed on\n\nthe anode surface, and when the field increases sufficiently;\n\na new cycle begins.\n\nThe oscillations will exist, then, whenever the steady\xc2\xad\nstate electric field is within a range such that it is great\n\nenough to cause some field emission of anode surface ions\n\nand not so great that .it steadily removes them as fast as\n\nFrequency is determined principally by the\n\nthey are formed.\ndiffusive and convective loss rate.\n\nThe greatest difficulty in comparing theory and experiment\n\nis that ion emission usually occurs at one or more spots on\n\nthe surface where thelocal electric field must be a bit\n\nlarger than anywhere else, so brightly glowing spots are seen\n\non the anode, and the firing of one spot triggers that of\n\nothers.\n\nAttempts are in progress to control the formation of spots\n\nand otherwise alter the behavior of these oscillations by\n\nchoice of anode geometry, material, finish, temperature, and\n\ngeometry of the surrounding region.\n\n\n72\nTransverse Stream Instabilities in Plasmas\nDr. W. Bennett\nNorth Carolina State Univ.\nThe objective in this project is to produce a steadily running\n\nundriveh pinch and to examine the instabilities which may exist in such\n\nstreams.\n\nThe project is supported by the Electrophysics Branch of the\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration and involves the production\n\nof high current high voltage electric pinches in small diameter beams and\n\nto observe the transition of these beams into a simultaneous electric and\n\nmagnetic pinch.\n\nStudies are being made of:\n\n(I) the physical processes\n\n\nin these two kinds of pinch; (2) the onset of beam instabilities as the\n\nmagnetic pinch becomes dominant; (3) the interaction of these beams with\n\ntheir associated plasmas.\n\nIn earlier work, it was found that undriven electron beams do\n\nnot readily accumulate ions from low density residual gas and retain them\n\nin sufficient quantity to neutralize the space change and permit the\n\nmagnetic pinch to set in.\n\nFor this reason, it was decided to undertake to\n\n\nincrease the intensity of electrically pinched beams sufficiently to provide\n\nthe essential conditions for the magnetic pinch to become predominant.\n\nIn order to undertake this kind of investigation properly, it has\n\nbeen necessary to develop a directional plasma probe with which velocity\n\ndistributions can be measured.\n\nThe basic principle used in this probe is\n\n\nsimilar \'to that in a probe which has been successfully flown on a rocket\n\nin some earlier space research.\n\nThe probe in its present form consists of\n\n\ntwo knitted 0.0005 in. tungsten grids and a 150 conical collector.\n\nThe\n\n\nouter grid is attached to a metal sleeve which surrounds the rest of the\n\nprobe.\n\nThe leads to the interior parts of the probe are glass covered.\n\n\nThe outer grid and sleeve core are held at the potential at which the probe\n\n\n73\n\nleast disturbs the surrounding plasma.\n\nFor measurements of the electron\n\n\nvelocity distribution in the direction of the probe axis, the inner grid\n\nis held at positive potential sufficient to turn back all positive ions\n\nwhich enter through the outer grid.\n\nThe electron current to the conical\n\n\ncollector is measured with a full feed back amplifier based at potentials\n\nwhich are swept through a range of negative values to cover the range of\n\nelectron velocities in that direction.\n\nCorrections must be made for sec\xc2\xad\n\nondary emissions from the collector and for currents due to ionization\n\ninside the probe.\n\nFor measurements of the positive ion distributions, the\n\n\ninner grid is set at a negative potential sufficient to turn back all electrons\n\nwhich pass the outer grid, and the base potential of the amplifier is swept\n\nthrough a range of positive values to cover the range of ion velocities in\n\nthe direction of the probe axis.\n\nA tube has been built for examining electrically pinched streams\n\nby measuring velocity distributions of electrons and ions with directional\n\nprobes, magnetic stream deflections, stream attenuation, and other character\xc2\xad\nistics as a function of vapor density, beam current, beam voltage and tube\n\ndiameter.\n\nMethods have been developed in the gun design for protecting\n\ncoated cathodes from deterioration due to back bombardment by positive ions.\n\nIn essence, the procedure is to use a "grid" aperature as near the cathode\n\nas possible which is held at a more positive potential than any other poten\xc2\xad\ntial further down stream.\n\nIn order to go to the high voltage streams which\n\n\nwill be required in the later phases of this project, where much more\n\npositive potentials will be necessary beyond the end of the gun, it will be\n\nnecessary to design the gun to strongly defocus the back-streaming positive\n\nions before they cair-reach the coated cathode, or else to use bare cathodes\n\ninstead of the coated cathodes and to use narrow-band optical filters -in\n\norder to see the beam while focusing it.\n\n\nDItnOEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\n75\n\nPULSED PLASMA PRbPULSION\n\nR. G. Jahn and W. von Jaskowsky\n\nPrinceton University, Princeton, New Jersey\n\nDespite the advanced state of development of ion propulsion devices, and the\n\nvery promising early performance of steady magnetoplasmadynamic are thrusters,\n\ncontinued interest in the inherently more complex pulsed mode of plasma acceleration\n\nis sustained by four potentially profitable basic characteristics. Specifically,\n\npassage of the current through the plasma in intermittent intense pulses may be\n\nexpected (1) to provide higher average thrust density than by steady consumption\n\nof the same electric power; (2) to involve less heat transfer loss and electrode\n\nerosion than equal power steady arc devices; (3) to minimize undesirable kinetic\n\nthermalization within the accelerating plasma; and (4) to generate various unsteady\n\nelectromagnetic field effects which aid in the acceleration and containment of the\n\nplasma.\n\nPractical implementation of these potential advantages requires detailed\n\nunderstanding of the participating phenomena. Any pulsed plasma accelerator must\n\nexecute the following controlled sequence of physical processes: (a) the appropriate\n\namount of electrical energy must be accumulated in the external circuit, e.g. in a\n\nhigh performance capacitor; (b) a proper distribution of propellant gas must be\n\nestablished in the accelerator channel; (c) the circuit must be completed by a\n\ndischarge across the channel electrodes, in the proper geometric location at the\n\nproper time in the cycle; (d) this discharge must rapidly intensify to a self\xc2\xad\naccelerating current sheet which covers the entire channel cross-section, is\n\nimpermeable to ambient gas ahead of it and its self-magnetic field behind it, and\n\ncan accelerate over the full channel length stably and with total -ambient gas\n\nentrainment; (a) when the accelerated mass of gas and plasma reaches the end of\n\nthe channel, it must be ejected with a minimum of thermal and electromagnetic loss;\n\n(f) finally, the entire gasdynamic and electromagnetic system must recover its\n\ninitial situation, prior to initiation of a new cycle.\n\nOver the past four years our laboratory has carried out a spectrum of basic\n\nexperiments and related analytical studies encompassing all of the six phases of\xc2\xad\nthe pulsed plasma acceleration cycle outlined above. The apparatus has been\n\ndeveloped primarily from the standpoint of controlledfreproducible experimentation\n\nwith maximum diagnostic accessibility, rather than focusing on any particular\n\nthrustor geometry. At present we have operative five different discharge chambers\n\ndriven by a variety of capacitor banks, pulse-forming networks-and special energy\n\nstorage units. Peak discharge currents hp to 106 amp at 10 KIV may be attained,\n\nand pulse lengths from 1/2 to 100 psec are available. Diagnostic equipment employed\n\nincludes electric and magnetic probes, voltage dividers, D loops and Rogowski coils,\n\nstreak arid Kerr cell cameras, a grating monochrometer and gas laser , high speed\n\npiezoelectric transducers and 4 mm. microwave bridges and interferometers. Vacuum\n\nfacilities include a 3\' dia. x 6\' long Plexiglas tank capable of eacuation to\n\n10-5 torr. (32,35)\n\nFor purposes of this presentation we will illustrate the program with two of\n\nthe currently active studies: the production of various driving current waveforms\n\nand their effect on the development of the plasma acceleration process;(33\'- ) and\n\nthe distribution of current density and magnetic field in exhaust plumes from one\n\n\n9 32\ntype of accelerator. ( 1 8 ,2 0 ,21,2 , ) With regard to the former we begin by\n\nnoting that while it is quite conventional to drive puilsed accelerators with\n\nsource for this\n\nfree-ringing lumped capacitor banks, this is far from an ideal \n\nwith each reversal of the damped sinusoidal current pattern\n\npurpose. Associated\nsecondary "crowbar" breakdown in the discharge chamber which effectively\n\nis a \n\nuncouples the primary current sheet from the energy source, leaving it 4 to\n\n2\ndissipate itself over the remainder of its motion down the channel.( , ,5)\n\nThese secondary breakdowns also badly complicate the experimental diagnosis of\n\nthe discharge-acceleration events by the techniques outlined above. Both\n\nproblems have been eliminated by replacing the lumped capacitor bank with a\n\npulse-forming line capable of providing a variety of high current waveforms at\n\nthe operator\'s discretion. Essentially the device is an L-C ladder network\n\nformed by two parallel collector plates, along which stock capacitors may be\n\nattached at arbitrary locations. As suspected, the driving current waveform is\n\nfound to have a profound influence on the effectiveness of the discharge\n\nacceleration process. Sweeping efficiency and terminal velocity of current\n\nsheets in a given accelerator can be changed by an order of magnitude by proper\n\ndistribution of the same total electrical energy in the current-pulse. Figure I\n\nshows four example current waveforms constructed by\'this facility and corresponding\n\nstreak photographs of an 8" diameter, linear pinch discharge in argon driven\n\nby them.\n\n\nThe importance of the plasma exhaust phase to the over-all performance of\n\na pulsed thrustor is evident enough; whatever energy is expended in ejecting the\n\nplasma slug, or remains trapped within it in various thermal modes, detracts\n\nfrom the total thrust efficiency. Although it is difficult to reduce this problem\n\nto concise elements for systematic study, any information about the development\n\nof current density and magnetic field patterns in the plume will provide some\n\ninsight into the ejection mechanisms. For this purpose, a special discharge\n\nchamber with 4" dia. orifice, driven by a 6500 joule pulse line,(32) is allowed\n\nto eject plasma into a large Plexiglas vacuum tank. 3 5 ) Here the development of\n\nthe luminous pattern of the exhaust plume may be determined by Kerr cell\n\nphotography, and the distribution of magnetic fields and current densities\n\nmapped with magnetic probes and Rogowski loops. Typical patterns are shown in\n\nFig. 2. Substantial cu.rents are found to extend far out into the plume, and\n\nthe sense of the local j x B body force is predominantly favorable to continued\n\nexpansion or detachment of the plume. One significant result of such studies is\n\nthe identification of a transient phase of ejection, wherein discrete current\n\nsheets propagate through the plume, "sweeping" gas along much as they do within\n\nthe discharge chamber, followed by a more steady phase, wherein the current\n\npatterns stabilize and revert to a "pumping" mode of gas acceleration much like\n\nthat of the steady magnetoplasmadynamic arcs. A second result of interest is a\n\ndemonstrated sensitivity of some aspects of plume development to relatively\n\nsmall changes in ambient gas pressure in the exhaust tank, emphasizing the\n\nimportance of test. environment to this phase of the acceleration process.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n77\n\n\n1. \t\n"Proposed Studies of the Formation and Stability of an Electromagnetic\n\nBoundary in a Pinch."

Gorowitz, and T. W. Karras\n\nGeneral Electric Space Sciences Laboratory, King of Prussia, Pa.\n\nProblem Definition\nThis program was initiated for the purpose of developing an efficient\nreliable, lightweight device for ionizing and accelerating gaseous, sub\xc2\xad\nstances to velocities the order of 5 x 104 meters/second. A coequal part\nof the program is the generation of experimental data which will permit a\nbetter understanding of the acceleration mechanisms involved in a coaxial\ngun.\nBackground\nThe motivation tbrthis research is the requirement for thrusters\nwith specific impulse characteristics higher than available from chemical\nor nuclear rockets to permit higher payload fractions in interplanetary\nspace rissions with intermediate characteristic lengths (the order of\n3 x 10 Em), acceptable payloads for deeper solar system exploration\n(characteristic lengths up to 5 x 10 Kin), and economically feasible solar\nsystem escape. With respect to competing electric thruster concepts,\npulsed plasma devices offer the potential of much higher average thrust\nper unit area than electrostatic devices ( -r B 2/ 2 go vs E E2\n/) and\no\nmuch higher peak thrust (with possibly resulting higher coupling efficiency)\nat a given average power level than steady-state MPD arcs.\nApproach\n\nThe program consists of the construction of various accelerator\nconfigurations based on current understanding of acceleration mechanisms,\nmeasurement of the gross performance characteristics (thrust, mass flow,\npower input) of such configurations, confirming measurements and detailed\nplasma diagnostics (exhaust stream calorimetry, particle velocity and\nenergy probe, magnetic field probe, current probes, particle density probes,\nterminal measurements, and spectroscopy) on the most promising of these\nconfigurations, and the updating of the understanding of the acceleration\nmechanisms (See Figure 1)\n\n84\n\nResults\nIn terms of gross performance measurements,\n\nthe best numbers\n\nconsistently generated to date are an overall efficiency (%0 = TZ/Zr a P)\nof 70% or more at a specific impulse (Isp = T/r g) of 5000 seconds,\nThe power-to-thrust ratio at this point is about 3.6 x 104 meters/second\n(160 KW/pound) and is constant within 5% of this value from 3300 to 5400\nseconds specific impulse.\nThe most complete diagnostics to date exist fcr an operating point\nattained earlier, which was i7 o = 57%, Isp = 4800 seconds, obtained at a\nmass flow rate of 2.96 x i0 - 7 Kg/sec, a capacitance of 144.5 mfd, a\n-1\npotential of 950 volts, a pulsing rate of 10 sec , xenon propellant, and\nthe A-7D gun configuration (see Figures 2-4). The relations\n\n2\n=\n\nv\n\n-\n\n2\ncosa\n\nv\n\nI\n\n=\n\n;/g\n\nV g/\n\nsp\nwere used to generate second values for 710 and Isp for comparison with\nthe results of the gross performance measurements. ?7E was obtained by\nthe use of a water-cooled calorimeter placed in the exhaust stream during\nrepetitive operation of the accelerator under conditions equivalent to those\ncited. An upper limit to flm was obtained by measuring the fraction of\ngaseous propellant available to the discharge by means of a small, fast\nionization gauge pressure sensor (See Figure 5) used to map the propellant\ndensity prior to discharge as a function of both time after injection and\nposition in the discharge region (See Figures 6-8).\n\nThe factors v, v Z\n\n,\n\nand cosZ a were obtained by means of the particle velocity and energy\nprobe (See Figures 9-13), taking into account the t m of the device. The\nvlues obtained are\n\nm = 90%,\n7TI 7_72%, v = 4.8 x 10\n\nmeters/see,\n\nv / v? = 86%, and cos a = 97%. Thus, the agreement between t7 and 7o\nis within 10%1, as is the agreement between Isp and Isp which is remarkable\nin view of the estimated cumulative measuring accuracy of 20%. An account\xc2\xad\ning of current distributions both inside and outside of the accelerator added\ncredence to these results, as did the operating background pressure level\nof about i0-5 mm and an extended run of 10 hours under equivalent operating\nconditions with no degradation of performance.\nFuture Plans\nThe mainstream of the next contractual effort will be to adapt the coaxial\ngun to the use of metal vapor propellant and determine the performance of this\ncombination. Additional studies using xenon propellant are in progress.\n\n85\n\nP. \t Gloersen, B. Gorowitz, and J. T.

Dethlefsen\n\nSpace Science Lab., General Dynamics Convair, San Diego, Calif.\n\nSince 1961, a development program for pulsed plasma guns has been jointly\nsponsored by NASA-Lewis and General Dynamics Convair.\nThe principal Lewis goal\nhas been to demonstrate competitive thrust efficiencies in such devices. This\nyear the number of industry bompetitors in this field has been reduced to one,\nthe decision being based on the efficiency of presently existing accelerators.\nAs the Convair program nears completion, it is appropriate at this conference,\nto summarize the effort and results, and to list the related publications. The\naccomplishments of the last year are given in abstracts of recent meetings and\n\nare reproduced here. \nFinally, the results will be given of recent experiments\n\nwhich were designed specifically to measure the performance of the pulsed plasma\n\ndevice of Gloersen, Gorowitz, and Karras.\n\nThe Convair program began with a strong diagnostic effort to examine the\n\nplasma energy transfer processes. Electromagnetic field probes were developed\n\nand applied to measuring the phenomena within the discharge. The techniques of\n\nFaraday cups, gridded electrostatic analyzers, and other particle analyzers were\n\nestablished for the exhausts of pulsed plasma guns. \n Scaling laws were verified\n\nfor the control of Is \n for guns operating with various propellant distributions,\n\ne.g., uniform fill an slug fill. The applicability of the snow-plow model was\n\nestablished. Fundamental limitations, due to the physics of the plasma processeE\n\nin two modes of plasma accelerators were recognized. Important parametric re\xc2\xad\nlationships which affect performance were empirically determined. Three techno\xc2\xad\nlogical spin-offs have occurred: an order of magnitude improvement in energy\nstorage capacitors; \n high speed, low power, compact gas valve; the founding of\n\na\nthe pulsed MPD arc technology.\nTo illustrate our recent work, we include abstracts of two papers given\nat the Fifth Electric Propulsion Conference, March 1966.\n\nPaper (66-199),\n\n" Experiments with a Pulsed Arc Plasma Thruster."\n\nA series of experiments with an improved version of our pulsed arc plasma\nthruster will be described. This thruster is similar to the MPD arc jets ex\xc2\xad\ncept that it is pulsed. The propellant feed system and the power supply are\nbuilt so that the thruster operates in a steady-state mode for 650 psec. The\n\npower level ranges between 10 kw and 1.5 Mw. Hall current, radial current, and\nmagnetic field measurements have been made within the thruster discharge. The\nHall current density is generally an order of magnitude larger than the radial\n\ncurrent density. The jeGr force is about twice larger than the JrBo force. It\nis estimated that WT-equals 5 for the electrons. The thruster current, voltage,\nion exhaust velocity, and ion density have been measured as functions of the in\xc2\xad\njected mass flow rate with helium, nitrogen, and argon propellants. The thrust\n\nis not strongly dependent uon the injected i1and, therefore, the apparent effi\xc2\xad\nciency is very high at low m. \nIt has been found that the cathode erosion becomes\n\nimportant at low mass flow rates, but complete erosion studies have not been done\n\nPaper (66-238), "Experiments with a Voltage Switched Pulsed Coaxial Gun."\n\nAn experimental program will be described which investigates the behavior of\na pulsed coaxial thruster in which slug-model propellant distributions are used.\n\n100\n\nThe propellant is injected radially through ports located near the insulat6r.\nThe gas valve opens in about 100 Isee and a plenum is used to control the\n\namount of propellant injected. A triggered voltage switch is -used to delay\n\nthe time between propellant injection and ,thrusterdischarge. Measurements\xc2\xad\nare made of the neutral gas distribution prior to the discharge, the current\n\ndistribution, the ion velocity and energy in the exhaust, and \'the calorimetric\nand thrust efficiency. The variables include the firing delay, mass load,\n\ncapacitor voltage, and barrel geometry. The thruster operates in an axially\xc2\xad\nsymmetric stable manner over an interval in which the gas distribution changes\nfrom the slug-model approximation to a nearly uniform distribution. Peak calori\xc2\xad\nmetric efficiencies of 70 occur for propellant distributions which approximate\nthe slug model. The efficiency increases with capacitor voltage and is rather\ninsensitive to plenum pressure.\nSince March,. we have concentrated on measuring a duplicate of the G. E.\n\naccelerator for which high efficiencies have been reported. Performance has\nbeen measured as a function of propellant species, port location, direction of\npropellant injection, firing delay, and barrel geometry. The important result\nis-that it has not been possible in our installation to achieve the efficiency\n\nreported by General Electric., or to exceed efficiencies achieved by the various\n\nGeneral Dynamics accelerator designs.\n\nPublications for NASA Related Work\n\n,"The use of Magnetic Probes in Plasma Diagnostics," R.

Ali\n\n.L\nThe Catholic Uni\'ersity of America\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn pulsed plasma accelerator, the process-by which the neutral gas is ionized,\'\n\nheated and acquires momentum is not fully understood. A simple model in which a\n\nshock wave, with no losses, is accelerated by magnetic piston is certainly inadequate\'.\n\nInorder-to understarid these processes, the transient plasma state must be known, i.e.,\n\nelectron densities, composition, temperatures are required for comparison with theoret\xc2\xad\nical models.\n\nIn our project, it is intended: a) to apply spectroscopic techniques to diagnose\nthe plasma produced in sqme typical plasma accelerator and compare the results with\nthose obtained by other investigators; b) to compare existing theory for plasma acceler\xc2\xad\n-atlon with the measurement; c) to account for the energy deposited in the plasma in order\nto give further information on losses.\nAs a first step ofthe project, accelerated plasma produced by a coaxial plasma\ngun which was operated at static ambient pressure (helium) was studied. \'Electron tem\xc2\xad\nperature1 electron density, -and other particle densities are determined at a location\nwhich is 1 cm outside the gun end. Furthermore, the electron temperature and the\ndensity were obtained as a function of radius of outer electrode using Abel inversion\nprocedure with a series of measurements.\nThe same\'technique has been extended into the gun barrel to diagnose accelerating\n.current layer. The electron densities and temperatures inside the gun were relatively high\nand were fcund\'to be Te :-- I1I eV and Ne cr7 X j1 7 cm- 3 at the location which is\n7.5 cm from the insulator.\n\nL03\n\nMPD ARC ,JET TfUSTOR RESEARCH\n\nContract RAS 3-2593\n\nAVCO Corporation\n\nSpace Systems Division\n\nWilmington, Massachusetts\n\nInvestigators:\n\nPrincipal \n\n-\nDr. R. R. John and Dr. S. Bennett\n\nAssociates \xc2\xad Mr..G. Enos and Dr. A- Tuchman\n\n\nObjective: \n\nThe overall purpose of the subject research and development\n\nprogram is to establish whether the laboratory MPD\narejet, which appears to\'be\n\nan efficient gas accelerator, can be converted into\na reliable low thrust\'space\n\npropulsion engine.\n\nBackground: \n\nA typical MPD arcjet configuration is shown in figure\n1.\n\nThe basic unit is axially symmetric, consisting of a\ncentral cathode surrounded\n\nby a co-axial anode, and can be operated both with\nand without a magnetic field\n\nThe working fluid is accelerated both by aerodynamic\nand magnetoplasmadynamic\n\nforces as it passes through and around the discharge.\nAlthough there is con\xc2\xad\nsiderable controversy regarding the exact nature of\nthe gas acceleration\n\nprocess, the basic thrust producing mechanisms\nare associated with: \n (1) Aerodynamic pressure characteristic of the MPD arcjet\n\nforces (thermal abceleration);\n\n(2) Self-induced magnetic field forces; and (3) External\nmagnetic field forces.\n\nProgress and Results: \n Five basic thrust producing\nmechanisms have been pro\xc2\xad\nposed as being characteristic of plasma generators\nof the type shown in figure\n\n1. These are: (1) Aerodynamic pressure forcesl \n\n(2) Magnetic pumping; (3)\n\nMagnetic blowing; (4) Aerodynamic swirl introduced by\nelectromagnet forces;\n\nand (5) Hall current acceleration. Aerodynamic pressure\nforces are associated\n\nwith thermal expansion of a gas within confining solid\nwalls; magnetic pumping\n\nresults from the interaction of the axial discharge\nthe self-induced azimuthal magnetic field, Be, i.e. current density, jg, with\n\nTpump = \n /2 I2; magnetic\n\n1\nblowing results from the interaction of the radial\ncomponent of the current\n\ndensity, r, with the self-induced azimuthal magnetic\nfield, Be, i.e. Tblow\n\n12 (1/4 + Un ra/rc), where ra and r. are respectively\n\n\nthe radial extent .of\n\nthe current distribution \'at the anode and cathode. \n\nThese three thrust mechan\xc2\xad\nisms have been clearly identified and their existence\nis not dependent on the\n\npresence of a magnetic field-\n The remaining mechanisms\nare associated with\n\nan external field. \nThe magnetic swirl is associated\nwith the bulk rotation\n\nof the gas and results from the interaction of jr with\nBe. Finally, the Hall\n\ncurrent term is associated with the interaction of Je\nwith Br. \nNo simple\n\nanalytical expressions have been derived for the, external\nfield terms except\n\nempirically it has been established that Ttotal \n\n- Taero - Tsel f\nTexternal=\nf (IB).\nAs was originally pointed out by Fahleson for the case\nof a plasma rotating\nin a magnetic field 2 , and by Cann for the MPD arcjet 3\n, the available gas flow,\n\nit, add the gas flow, 6d, accelerated and ionized-by-the\ndischarge are not, a\npriofi, equal. \nThe concept of a characteristic discharge\nmass flow has been\n\nstrikingly verified experimentally at this laboratory\nby the observatioi that\n\nthe engine will operate and produce thrust with no\nmass flow passing through\n\n\nlo4\n3\nthe propellant feed iine. - ,By analogy with conventional arcs Cann proposed\nthat the MPD discharge would operate at a power level such that the input\npower is .minimized; Fahleson 2 , on the other hand, following a suggestion of\n\nAlfven, postulated the discharge would operate .at a mass flow such that the\n\nkinetic and ionization energies of the particles in the discharge mass flow\n\nare equal. Assuming that the input power-is primarily absorbed in kinetic\n\nand ionization energy the two postulates are identical. From energy consider\xc2\xad\nations the flow velocity -at minimum input power is given by Ucrit = -42eVi/ \'\nma; the critical mass flow becomes mdmin = T/ AeVi/ma; and the minimum power\nThe empirically observed linearity between V and B\nis IV)min = T j2eVi/m.\nand T and IB, shown in figures 2 and 3, is compatible with these minimum\nenergy considerations.\n.The preceding discussion has been based on a macroscopic-description of accel\xc2\xad\nerator performance. It has been proposed that the external magnetic field\n\nforms a magnetic nozzle in which azimuthal kinetic energy resulting from the\n\nintkradtion of BE and ar is "spun out" into axially directed kinetic energy;\nhowever, the exact nature of acceleration and confinement process is liot at\nall clear. Local current measurements in the MPD arcjet discharge obtained\n\nwith Hall effect sensors, suggest that the basic acceleration process occurs\n\nwithin two or three diameters of the engine face. The local cathode tip\n\npressure is observed to decrease with increase in magnetic field suggesting\n\nmagnetic confinement effects; and, finallyj local velocity measurements with\n\na Faraday probe indicate strong radial velocity dependence.

L. Cann, P. F. Jacobs\n\nElectro-Optical Systems, Inc.,\n\nA.Subsidiary of Xerox Corporation\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA program to investigate experimentally and analytically axisymmet-,\n\nric Hall current accelerators has been completed. The results are reported\n\nin Ref. I. The purpbse of the investigations was to determine the perfor\xc2\xad\nmancepotential of such a device as an electric space propulsion engine.\n\nParametric studies of the accelerator were made with several propellants,\n\nemphasis being placed upon the tests using hydrogen and sodium. The\n\naccelerators used in these tests are shown schematically in Figs. la and\n\nlb. The overall performance measured in these devices is presented in\n\nFigs. 2a and 2b. Some diagnostic measurements on the engine and exhaust\n\nbeam were made and are reported, the most important being a determination\n\nof the current path in the exhaust beam of the hydrogen accelerator. The\n\nresults of one such measurement is shown in Fig. 3. Mechanisms to explain\n\nthrust production and other engine characteristics are postulated and\n\ndiscussed in detail. The concept of an "effective" mass flow rate, which\n\nis determined by a minimum potential hypothesis, is developed to the\n\npoint where a complete analysis of a simplified model of the accelerator\n\ncan be made. Such an analysis is completed and the results are compared,\n\nwhere possible, with experimental results.\n\nAdequate detailed knowledge of accelerator mechanisms to use in an\n\nengine optimization program was not generated by the above program nor is\n\nit available elsewhere. A detailed diagnostic program\' coupled with an\n\nanalytic investigation, has been undertaken to fulfill this need in our\n\npresent contract work with NASA.\n\nThe fundamental goals of this study are to investigate the opera\xc2\xad\ntion of an alkali metal accelerator with background pressures less than\n-4\n10 torr, imput power 5 - 50 kw over the specific impulse range of 1000\xc2\xad\n6000 sec. A parametric investigation of overall performance (thrust,\n\nthrust efficiency and thermal efficiency) with variations in input power,\n\nmass flow rate and magnetic field is to be carried out. The following\n\ndiagnostic measurements are to be made:\n\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n5)\n6)\n7)\n8)\n9)\n\nAxial Ion Velocity\n\nRotational Ion Velocity\n\nThrust\n\nTorque\n\nMagnetic Field Distribution\n\nCurrent Density Distribution\n\nTot&l Beam Power\n\nLocal Mass Flux\n\nLocal Energy Flux\n\n\n109\n\n110\n\nThe axial ion velocity is being measured by both Doppler spectros\xc2\xad\ncopy and tracer techniques. The ion rotational velocity is being\n\ndetermined solely by spectroscopy. The accelerator thrust is measured\n\nwith a reaction balance, and the angular momentum in the beam will be\n\nmeasured with a torque target. The spatial distribution of the three\n\ncomponents of the magnetic field will be measured with a Hall-effect\n\nmagnetic probe composed of three mutually orthagonal sensing elements.\n\nThe distribution of current density within the plasma is determined from\n\nm\nthese \t easurements through graphical differentiation and the use of\n\nMaxwell\'s equations. The total beam power will be measured with a\n\ncalorimeter composed of 16 separate, water cooled, concentric, ring\n\nelements. The use of separate elements is itportant not only from the\n\nstandpoint of a more detailed distribution throughout the plasma, but\n\nalso to avoid shorting the radial electric fields which are probably\n\npresent. The local energy and mass flux distributions will be measured\n\nwith two new probes. The former consists of an open ended. water cooled,\n\ncalorimeter and the latter depends upon the time varying resistance of a\n\ndeposited layer of alkali-metal (viz. lithium) between two collecting\n\nelements on an insulating substrate. The time rate of change of the\n\ncurrent is then related to the instantaneous local value of the alkali\n\nmetal mass flux.\n\nPreliminary results indicate rotational ion velocities of about\n\n4000 meters/second at a radial position 1 cm from the jet centerline. A\n\nnumber of spectral lines associated with transitions between the upper\n\nexcited states of the lithium ion have definitely been observed. Since\n\nthese states have energies in excess of 50 electron-volts, relative to\n\nthe atomic ground state, this indicates reasonably high plasma electron\n\ntemperatures. The preliminary tests with the mass deposition probe\n\nindicate the utility of this device as a plasma diagnostic tool. Further\n\ncalibration and elimination of effects related to variations in the local\n\nplasma potential are still necessary.\n\n\nReference:\n\n1. \t G. L. Cann, et al., "Hall Current Accelerator."

Opp/Physics and Astronomy Programs\n\nOffice of Space Science and Applications, NASA\n\n\nOne of the objectives of the Physics and Astronomy Programs is to\n\nunderstand the physical processes occurring in space. Space is one\n\nof the most nearly perfect low density collisionless plasma laboratories\n\navailable. Thus, many of the phenomena which are of interest to space\n\nphysicists are also of great interest to plasma physicists, and vice\n\nversa.\n\nSpace plasmas exist from the lower boundary of the ionosphere to the\n\nouter limit of the Universe. Before the advent of satellites the\n\nterrestrial ionosphere was probably the best understood space plasma.\n\nNone the less, ionospheric satellites enabled observations to be made\n\nabove the range of ground based ionosondes and increased immeasurably\n\nthe knowledge of the topside of the ionosphere. They also presented\n\nplasma physicists with observations of a new phenomenon, the so-called\n\nAlouette resonances.\n\nBeyond the ionosphere one finds the trapped radiation belts. The\n\nmechanisms of trapping, particle acceleration and containment in the\n\nearth\'s magnetic field are still poorly understood, as is the magne\xc2\xad\ntospheric tail and its relation to the radiation belts and auroral\n\nzones.\n\nThe earth\'s magnetic field and the radiation belts are terminated at\n\napproximately 10 earth radii in the subsolar direction by the solar\n\nwind.- The transfer of energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere\n\nis one of the most challenging problems of contemporary space plasmas.\n\nExtensive satellite and theoretical investigations of the interaction\n\n\nof the solar wind with the earth!s field are being conducted in an\n\n\nattempt to understand the physical processes associated with the energy\n\n\ntransfer.\n\nThe nature and origin of the solar wind is also being actively investi\xc2\xad\n\ngated. The existence of the solar wind has been firmly established.\n\nIt remains, however, to define its detailed spectral characteristics\n\nand temporal variations, particularly as these can be related to events\n\non the sun or in near interplanetary space.\n\n\nThe sun has been studied for centuries. Yet there still exist no fully\n\nsatisfactory theories for many solar phenomena. Undoubtedly, the ultimate\n\n\n118\n\nexplanations will have their foundations in plasma physics, and\n\nconversely, solar physicists will undoubtedly present plasma physicists\n\nwith new phenomena for explanation.\n\nThe radial extent of the solar wind is a matter of speculation.\n\nEstimates range from 2 or 3 to over 100 astronomical units. The inter\xc2\xad\naction of the solar wind with the galactic cosmic ray gas and galactic\n\nmagnetic field are matters of considerable interest to cosmologists as\n\nwell as the origin and propagation of the cosmic ray gas in the Galaxy\n\n\n119\n.EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL INVESTIGATIONON\n\nSELECTED ASPECTS OF PLASMA TURBULENCE\n\nI. B Bernstein, Yale University; New Haven, Conn.\nThe theoretical work accomplished thus..far has included\n\nstudies of the quasi-linear theory of plasma waves appropriate-for.\n\nan understanding of Plasma turbulence, and an analysis of the sta\xc2\xad\nbility of the Chapman-Ferraro model of the magnetopause against\n\ngusting in the solar wind.\n\nThese latter studies are being extended\n\n\nusing an ideal magnetohydrodynamic model which includes the bow\n\nshock.. Also under way are studies of the interaction of electro\xc2\xad\nmagnetic waves and the proper oscillations of the plasma in systems\n\nexhibiting sheaths.\n\nExperimental studies already well under way are in the\n\nareas of (a) light scattering from plasma fluctuations, (b) study\n\nof cyclotron resonance plasma echoes, and (c) study of finite geo\xc2\xad\nmetry plasma resonances:\n\nIn (a) both plasma production and laser\n\n\nstabilization are essentially solved;\n\nin (b) collisionless echoes\n\n\ndue to relativistic mass shift have been observed;\n\nin\' (c) resonance\n\n\nspectra both with and without streaming are undergoing study and\n\nanalysis.\n\n\nPRECEDIING PAGE BLANK NOT FIL121\nINVESTIGATION OF PLASMA RESONANCE PHENOMENA\nS. J. Tetenbaum\n\nLockheed Research Laboratories, Palo Alto, California\n\n\nThis investigation was undertaken to obtain an understanding of electron\nresonance phenomena in laboratory and ionospheric plasmas and to evaluate the\napplicability of such phenomena to the measurement of charged particle den\xc2\xad\nsities, temperatures and magnetic field strengths in planetary atmospheres\n\nand interplanetary space. Experiments were performed on RF-excited, elec\xc2\xad\ntrodeless, pulsed and steady state, low-pressure Helium discharges of\n\nrelatively simple geometry which simulate a plasma slab in a uniform magnetic\n\nfield. The wave frequency, w. the magnetic field intensity, B. = mw /e, the\n\n\n 0\ngas pressure, p, the electron density, electron temperature and the geometry\n\nwere chosen to provide an approximate correspondence between the laboratory\n\nplasma and the plasma environment of the Alouette satellite. The major\n\nresonances studied were the electron cyclotron harmonic resonances which\n\noccur near w = Nw where N is a positive integer. A schematic of the experi\xc2\xad\nmental arrangemen is shown in Figure 1. The plasma was created by a 22 MHz\n\npulsed or CW transmitter capacitively coupled to a rectangular Prex vessel\n\nhaving a 16.5 x 16.5 cm cross-section and an inside thickness d of 9.7 cm in\n\nthe direction of propagation. Its walls were ground to a thickness of a\n\nhalf-wavelength at 9.15 GHz, the frequency of the incident wave Pin* \nThe\n\nvessel was located in a DC magnetic field which was uniform to better than\n\n0.5% over the plasma volume. The measured magnetic field positions of the\n\nresonances are estimated to be accurate to 0.1%. \nA 36.0 GHz interferometer\nmeasured the average electron density over a 2 cm diameter cylindrical\nregion through the plasma coaxial with the interferometer horns. Measure\xc2\xad\nments were taken of P , the incoherent noise emission, of (P) and (Pw)R\nthe coherent transmitted and reflected fundamental waves and oT (p2)T and\n(P20)RI the corresponding second harmonic waves. The CW microwaves propa\xc2\xad\ngated in free space on either side of the plasma container in a direction\n\nperpendicular to the static magnetic field. The waves were launched and/or\n\ndetected by microwave horns located a few wavelengths from the plasma. The\n\nhorns could be rotated to propagate or receive either the extraordinary wave\n\n(E9 .15 1o)Or the ordinary wave (E9 lR JIBo). The intensity of a given wave\n\nat a fixed frequency of 9.15 GHz or 18.3 GHz was recorded as the magnetic\n\nfield was slowly swept in intensity and precise measurements were made of\n\nthe positions, amplitudes and line shapes of the resonances under varying\n\nconditions of the plasma parameters. Figure 2 shows the resonance amplitudes\n\nof some of the waves as a function of harmonic number N, where smooth curves\n\nhave been drawn through the measured points. The incoherent wave resonances\n\nreach maximum amplitude near N = 4 or 5 and thereafter gradually decrease\n\nwith increasing N, the ordinary wave resonances being 1 or 2 dB less than\n\nthe extraordinary wave resonances. The latter were observed up to N = 46.\n\nThe coherent wave resonances were only observed when the incident microwave\n\nelectric field was perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nFundamental wave\n\nresonances were observed up to N = 7, their amplitudes decreasing with\n\n\nincreasing N. They exhibited an increase in power relative to the back\xc2\xad\nground power in transmission, and a decrease in power relative to the\n\n\n122\n\nbackground power in reflection. Second harmonic wave resonances were observ\xc2\xad\ned up to W = 7. They exhibited an increase in power relative to the back\xc2\xad\nground power in,both transmission and reflection. The amplitudes of the\n(P2w)T resonances were about 3 d6 greater than those of (P 2)R\' and in some\n2\ncases were 16 dB above the second harmonic wave background. The rapid\ndecrease in resonance amplitude with increasing N may be related to the\nrapid decrease in the generated second harmonic in this magnetic field\nregion. Resonances were also observed in the sum frequency wave, P., due to\ntwo incident waves of frequency Wl/23t = 8.8 GHz and w2/2ir = 9.2 GHz. These\nresonances occurred close to wI = NWe\nand w2\nNc, N = 2, 3, 4 and 5.\nAttempts to observe resonances in P2 . near 2W = NW , N = 3,5,7, ...and in PS\nnear w1 + W = Nwc\nN\n3,4,5... were unsuccessfl. The coherent wave and\n3\nincoherent wave resonances exhibit different behaviour not only in their\namplitude dependence but also in their positions. Figure 3 shows how the\nemission resonance positions vary with N. The positions remained constant\nfor all harmonic numbers, for pressures from 0.02 to 0.3 Torr and for values\nof %,/w at the center of the discharge from 0.8 to 2.6, where wp is the\nelectron plasma frequency. The resonance positions of the two waves\ndiffered by 0.3%, those of the extraordinary wave occurring at a higher\nmagnetic field than those of the ordinary wave. In contrast, the coherent\nwave resonances were complicated functions of N, p ancI\nw/. Their positions\nvaried as much as 4% with variations in these parameters4 but always occurred\non the \'low frequency side of the exact harmonic. The coherent and\nincoherent wave resonance amplitudes also differ in their pressure depend\xc2\xad\nence. The former show definite collisional damping effects, the amplitudes\ndecreasing with increasing pressure, while the latter exhibit a maximum\namplitude at a pressure whose value depends upon W /W, the amplitude\ndecreasing for higher and lower pressures.The incoherent *ave resonances\nhad symmetrical but non-Lorentzian line shapes. The Q\'s of the extra\xc2\xad\nordinary wave resonances were about 40 and were about one third larger than\nthe Q\'s of the ordinary wave resonances. The coherent wave resonances had\nasymmetrical line shapes, their asymmetry decreasing with increasing N, and\nQ\'s of about 30. The coherent wave resonance lines were broader on their\nhigh magnetic field side and occasionally, for N = 2 and F = 3, showed the\npresence of additional small resonances. Experiments in which the center of\nthe plasma was moved relative to the center of the magnetic field have\nshown that the cyclotron harmonic emission is a volume effect rather than a\nsheath effect and that the radiated ordinary and extraordinary rave\nresonknoes originated in different regions of the plasma.\n\nMAGNET\nFIELD\nCONTROLLER\n\nRF\nGENERATOR\nPIN\n\n(Pw)R\n\n"\n\nHORN\n-<\n\n~\n\nMAGNET\nPOWER\nSUPPLY\n\n\nPOLE\n,_ -_--\n\nFLIP COIL\nMICROWAVE\nABSORBER\n\nPe\n(Po\'\n\n_\n\n/\n\nR\nHORN\n\nCAPACITOR\nPLATE\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nGAUSSMETER\n\nT\n\nrOMETER\nHORN\nDISCHARGE\nVESSEL\n\nNMR PROBE\n\nFIGUE 1\n\n124\n\n\n1\'\n\n14\'\n\n12\xc2\xad\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\'\n\nP = 37 mTORR\n\n(P2 w)T\n\nw/2r = 9145 MHz\nS1po/W = 1.3\n\nd/c = 18.5\n\n\'\n-\n\nLu\n\nU6\xc2\xad\n\n0\n\n2111\n42u\n\n(Pw)R\n\nPe\nI\n2\n\nI\n\n,l\n\'4\n\n\'6\n\n9-.15,P\n11rI\nI\n8\n\n12\n\n10\n\nHARMONIC NUMBER,\nFIGURE 2\n\n-\n\nI\nN\n\n14\n\n16\n\n125\n\n0o\n\n\'i\n\nI\n\nI\n\n.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4 \'\n\n2 \xc2\xad\n\nP\'-\n\nu\n\n73 mTORR\n\n1w/27r=9.145o\n\nGHz\n\n0\n\n3.\n\n-E9.15 11\n\nwpo/w = 2.2\n\n<\n\n9,1\n5\n\nco/\n- t \n t :N\n\nwd/c = 18.5\n\n4\n\n104-{-\n\n\n1.004 \xc2\xad\n\n4o\n\n:\n\n03-\xc2\xad\n\n002\n\n3T\nS".Nwco/1.000\n0 .99 8\n\n-\xc2\xad\n\n/\n\n--\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n6\nN\n\nIGU=E 3\n\n10\n\n12\n\n-126\nA-C TRAVELLING WAVE-PLASMA STREAM INTERACTIONS\n\nMartin Lessen\n\nThe University of Rochester\n\nRochester, New York\n\nNsG-350-63\n\nThe motivation of this problem was to investigate the\n\ninteraction of a travelling magnetic wave with a plasma.\n\nThe configuration selected for this research was a pair of\n\ncoaxial cylinders with an inner and outer shell of low re\xc2\xad\nluctance magnetic material. The configuration was chosen\n\nto provide an electrodeless machine with a nearly radial\n\nmagnetic field. The concept of this machine was first\n\npresented in reference (I) in which a single fluid model\n\nwas used for analysis. Subsequently, this type of confi\xc2\xad\nguration was discussed by Carter and Laubenstein (2) and\n\nmore recently by Penfold et al (3) and Schwirian (4).\n\nThe approach was initially in two directions. The\n\nfirst was the analysis of a three fluid one dimensional\n\nmodel of the device in which the principal mechanism for\n\nplasma neutral interaction was assumed to bb charge ex\xc2\xad\nchange. The second was experimental which involved con\xc2\xad\nstruction of the coaxial cylindrical device including the\n\nwindings low reluctance, magnetic material shells, gas\n\nmetering system and some diagnostic elements. This latter\n\narea indicated that a great deal had to be done before sig\xc2\xad\nnificant physical results could be obtained as to the in\xc2\xad\nternal interaction mechanisms.\n\nInitially several sets of windings were made and tuned\n\nin an attempt to obtain the strongest radial field with as\n\nlittle axial component as possible. The final design con\xc2\xad\nsisted of four 9 turn coils each approximately 9 inches\n\nlong. For this configuration the radial field strength\n\n-\n\nvaried from about 100 gauss to 160 gauss along the tube \n\nhaving maximums between the coils. At the same time, the\n\naxial component was about 20 to 25 gauss representing an\n\nangularity of the field midway in the annulus of some\n\nsignificance. The phase angle of the field fluctuated\n\nover a 12.5 \xc2\xb0 range along the tube from an assumed linear\n\n3600 total phase shift. Due to the field angularity the\n\nreaction with the plasma would drive many of the particles\n\nto the walls before the exit were reached, however, there\n\nshould be some measurable reaction. \nThe most direct measure\xc2\xad\nment was of the pressure distribution along the tube for a\n\ngiven flow rate. By having the field accelerate the plasma,\n\n\n127\na pressure drop from 300.Hg to 11 0 -Hg was recorded over\n\n3/4 of the tube length; connecting the field in reverse\n\nnecessitated an inlet pressure of approximately 800AzHg\n\nto realize the 100/Hg at the same point. Considerable\n\nchanges in the electrical power input were noted during\n\nthese interactions. Some estimate of the power transferred\n\nto the plasma was desired and coils wound in the annulus and\n\nconnected to non-inductive resistances were used for this\n\npurpose. Induced power in-the coils amounted to approximately\n6 KW. At this time the power to the coils totaled 10.2 KW.\nIn the discharge mode the power dropped to 5 KW to the coils\ndue to considerably more detuning.\nWork is continuing with the construction of a new\n\nmachine with conical geometry which should alleviate some\n\nof the problems of field angularity and the small annulus.\n\nAlso more room will exist for diagnostics than could be\n\naffected in the current machine. It is anticipated that\n\nthe question of the magnitude of elastic scattering of\n\nparticles and radial electric field effects can be looked\n\n-at as well as the continued investigation of overall in\xc2\xad\nteraction.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1 K.
