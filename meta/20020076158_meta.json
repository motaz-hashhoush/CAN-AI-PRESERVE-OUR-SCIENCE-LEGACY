Entrepreneur Louis Rosenberg, a former Stanford researcher, now president of Immersion, collaborated with Dr. Bernard Adelstein at Ames on studies of perception in virtual reality. The result was an inexpensive way to incorporate motors and a sophisticated microprocessor into joysticks and other game controllers. These devices can emulate the feel of a car on the skid, a crashing plane, the bounce of a ball, compressed springs, or other physical phenomenon. The first products incorporating I-FORCE technology include CH- Products' line of FlightStick and CombatStick controllers.", "title": "Force Feedback Joystick", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020076158, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020076158, "isbn": "0-16-049155-X", "id": "72e52ad9d6ba4c59842f0a7c12aacde3", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1997", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19970041341, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1997: 25 Years of Reporting Down-to-Earth Benefits", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020076158.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020076158/downloads/20020076158.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020076158/downloads/20020076158.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020076158/downloads/20020076158.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
