If the heat pipe operates under a reflux mode in ground testing, the liquid puddle will fill the entire cross sectional area of the evaporator. Under this condition, the heat pipe may not start when the evaporator temperature reaches the saturation temperature. Instead, a superheat is required in order for the liquid to vaporize through nucleate boiling. The amount of superheat depends on several factors such as the roughness of the heat pipe internal surface and the gravity head. This paper describes an experimental investigation of the effect of gravity pressure head on the startup of a heat pipe under reflux mode. In this study, a heat pipe with internal axial grooves was placed in a vertical position with different tilt angles relative to the horizontal plane. Heat was applied to the evaporator at the bottom and cooling was provided to the condenser at the top. The liquid-flooded evaporator was divided into seven segments along the axial direction, and an electrical heater was attached to each evaporator segment. Heat was applied to individual heaters in various combinations and sequences. Other test variables included the condenser sink temperature and tilt angle. Test results show that as long as an individual evaporator segment was flooded with liquid initially, a superheat was required to vaporize the liquid in that segment. The amount of superheat required for liquid vaporization was a function of gravity pressure head imposed on that evaporator segment and the initial temperature of the heat pipe. The most efficient and effective way to start the heat pipe was to apply a heat load with a high heat flux to the lowest segment of the evaporator.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20180002077, "endDate": "2018-03-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Aerospace Corp.", "location": "El Segundo, CA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "d95fac99c82d46eeb74380db46a8cf42", "id": "8022e81445854dc9928600e4978532c1"}], "name": "2018 Spacecraft Thermal Control Workshop", "location": "El Segundo, CA", "id": "d95fac99c82d46eeb74380db46a8cf42", "startDate": "2018-03-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180002077, "id": "4685fde3d9f647d0be5a6ae84eed8545", "publicationDate": "2018-03-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180002077.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180002077/downloads/20180002077.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180002077/downloads/20180002077.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180002077/downloads/20180002077.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
