A computer model which describes the near-Earth space environment created by the existing spacecraft and fragments from the associated spent launching vehicle attachments and explosions was developed. The present debris model adopts the mathematical formulations published in a paper by Kessler. Thus, the model uses more rigorous mathematical formulation in calculating the collision rate between two orbiting objects than the one published by Kessler and Cour-Palais (1978). The present model contains many general but detailed analyses on the debris environment such as manipulating and/or sorting the existing debris objects, the physical dimensions of the objects and extrapolating the number density describing to include the unobservable small objects.", "title": "NASA/JSC orbital debris study:  Debris model", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T15:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850012883, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Roberts, J.
