It will continue the study of the ionosphere\nfrom above (topside sounding) successfully begun with the\nAlouette I satellite.\nMore information on the nature and behavior of the\n\\\nionosphere is needed to Improve long-range radio transmissions which are possible only through use of the ionosphere\nto reflect them back to Earth.\n-more-\n\nl/21/69\n\n-2-\n\nMeasurements of the Ionosphere from above were begun\nwith the Canadian satellite Alouette I launched Sept. 29,\n1962 under a cooperative agreement between the Canadian\nDefense Research Board (DRB) and NASA.\nAlouette I, designed, engineered and constructed\nin Canada, established a longevity record and continues\nto return useful data after more than six years in orbit.\nThe success of Alouette I led the U.S. and Canada\nto agree to an expanded cooperative program of ionospheric\nstudies to extend through an entire solar cycle.\nThe ISIS series began with ISIS-X which was launched\nNov. 29* 1965 and consisted of the Canadian satellite\nAlouette II and the NASA Explorer XXXI (Direct Measurement\nExplorer). Both satellites provided excellent data and\ncontinue to transmit.\n\n\\\n\nISIS-A carries five Canadian and five United States\nexperiments. The satellite will be placed in a near-polar\nhighly elliptical orbit ranging from a high point of 2,200\nstatute miles (about 3,500 km) to a low point of 300 miles\n(about 565 km). It weighs 532 pounds and has a planned orbital\nperiod of 128 minutes.\nISIS-B and C are scheduled to be launched at about\none-year intervals after ISIS-A.\n\n-more-\n\n-3The ISIS program is conducted Jointly by NASA and\n\nthe Canadian Defence Research Board with each agency defraying the costs of its own portions of the program.\nDefence Research Telecommunications Establishment\n(DRTE) Ottawa, Ontario, a part of the DRB, is responsible\nfor management of the Canadian portion of the program and\nis the satellite design authority.\n\nNASA\'s Goddard Space\n\nFlight Center, Greenbelt, Md., is responsible for the U.S.\nportion of the program.\n\nThe Kennedy Space Center\'s Western\n\nTest Range, Lorapoc, Calif, will provide pre-launch and\nlaunch support.\nThe NASA STADAN tracking network, operated by Goddard\nSpace Plight Center, will track the ISIS satellite and\nacquire telemetry data. This network will be augmented by\nstations operated by the Canadian government, by France,\nthe United Kingdom and Norway and by KSSA for the U.S.\n\nIt\n\nis expected that stations in Antarctica, Japan, Australia\nand India will augment this effort as the program evolves.\nScientists in Australia, India, Hong Kong, Japan,\nFrance, and United Kingdom and Norway are actively participating with their Canadian and U.S. counterparts in the\nISIS Working Group which recommends topside ionospheric\nresearch activities using the satellites in the ISIS program\nwhich often relate to similar ground-based activities carried\nout in a number of countries around the world.\n-more-\n\n-4After evaluation by the principal investigators,\nscientific results will be made available to the world\nscientific community.\nISIS-A prime contractor is the RCA Victor Co., Ltd.,\nMontreal, Canada, under supervision of the DRTE. The Delta\nrocket is built by the McDonnell Douglas Corp., Santa Monica,\nCalif.\n\n(END OF GENERAL RELEASE:\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION FOLLOWS)\n\n-5THE IONOSPHERE\n\nScientists engaged in the ISIS-A program are concerned\nprimarily with the upper latitude regions of the ionosphere.\nSome of the radiation directed from the Sun towards the Earth\nis absorbed in the ionosphere which extends upwards from approximately 35 miles above Earth. During this absorption\nprocess, neutral air particles are split into electricallycharged ions and electrons. They create, in effect, an electrical conductor with the ability to reflect radio waves from\ntransmitters to receivers, and hence to guide these waves around\nthe curvature of the Earth by a process of successive reflection.\nWhen the ionosphere becomes disturbed following solar\nstorms or other phenomena associated with the Sun, its reflecting properties are affected. Consequently, radio communications\nare disrupted, sometimes for long periods. Hence, there is a\ndeep interest in studying the upper atmosphere in order to find\nmethods of overcoming the effects of ionospheric disturbances.\nAn unusual feature of the polar and subpolar ionosphere\nstems from seasonal variations of the polar atmosphere\'s solar\nillumination \xe2\x80\x94 continuous daylight in summer and continuous\nnight during the winter. A second feature of the ionosphere\nat high latitudes involves effects on ionlzation created by\ncharged solar particles.\nThe "auroral ionosphere" exhibits a wide variety of disturbed conditions. It resembles that in the temperate zones\nonly during quiet conditions and then only on rare occasions.\nPerhaps the worst ionospheric condition, from the standpoint of communications, is the so-called "polar blackout."\nDuring such occurrences, reflections cannot be obtained from\nthe ionosphere by most ground-based ionosphere recorders\n(called ionosondes). Consequently, the ionograms (or records\nof electron plasma frequency as related to height) obtained are\nsometimes completely blank. Rocket flights and other experiments\nhave shown that these polar blackouts stem from an abnormal increase in the ionization of a specific ionospheric region which\nis caused by solar particles. The effect on communications is\na complete cessation of radio sky-wave transmissions at high\nfrequencies due to absorption in the D-region.\n"Sudden ionospheric disturbances" also cause loss of communications, producing abrupt and simultaneous radio fadeout\nthroughout the hemisphere which may last from 10 minutes to an\nhour. Polar blackouts, however, are more gradual In their beginning and recovery and last for substantially longer periods \xe2\x80\x94\nsometimes continuously during the daylight hours for several\nconsecutive days.\n-more-\n\n-6The "ionospheric storm" is another type of disturbance\nintensified in the auroral zones. It is characterized by a\ngeneral instability of ionospheric conditions, a decrease in\nthe maximum density of ionization and an Increase in absorption. The maximum employable frequencies are much lower than\nnormal during these periods and the restricted communications\nspectrum is subject to rapid fluctuations in signal Intensity.\nAn ionosphere storm is usually accompanied by a period of unusual fluctuation in terrestrial magnetic intensity.\nThe topside satellite sounder technique (Alouette I and\nII, Explorer XXXI) developed under this program is the only\none known that can provide worldwide electron-density profiles\nsynoptlcally above the height of maximum electron density of\nthe ionosphere. (Ground stations can only sound up to the\nmaximum electron density.) These satellite soundings permit\nthe investigation of the physical properties of the upper ionosphere as a function of altitude, time and geographical location,\nIn addition to its scientific value, increased knowledge\ngained about the ionosphere can be applied directly to communications and tracking operations. The importance of the ionosphere to terrestrial radio communication is well known. Predictions of ionospheric storms and disturbances are often unsatisfactory because they are based on Inadequate information.\nBecause a thorough understanding of natural phenomena is a prerequisite to their intelligent use, improved knowledge of the\nentire mechanism should lead to more precise forecasts.\nThe present prediction of maximum usable frequencies for\ncommunications purposes is based on ionosondes from groundbased ionospheric stations. This information was considered\nof sufficient importance to Justify the establishment of about\n150 ground-based ionospheric sounding stations throughout the\nworld. This number of stations, however, still does not permit\naccurate worldwide mapping of the bottom-side ionosphere, and\nthe information from each station is insufficiently detailed.\nTwo of the most important observations obtained by these\nstations are the height and density of maximum ionization in\nthe ionosphere. Topside sounders are capable of providing\nthis information, together with the complete electron density\nprofile from the electron peak to the altitude of the satellite.\n\n-more-\n\n-6a-\n\nooaan\nDOODDODDO\nDDDOODQDO\n\nOOOOOOOD\n\n-more-\n\n-7THE ISIS-A SATELLITE\n\nIn ISIS-A, direct measurements will be combined with the\ntopside sounder to measure most of.the Important Ionospheric\nparameters at the same time and In the same location In space.\nHeavier than Its predecessor satellites Alouettes I and II,\nISIS-A will weigh 532 pounds. Like Its predecessors, It Is\nspheroid In configuration. Its outside surface Is covered with\nmore than 1 , 0 solar cells to power the batteries within.\n100\nISIS-A Is fitted with two extendable antennas, 240 and 62\nfeet long, respectively, to sound or probe the upper levels of\nthe Ionosphere. Pour telemetry antennas project from the base\nof the spacecraft to accept commands from the ground and to\ntransmit data gathered by the satellite to ground stations.\nQuadraloop antennas are mounted around the satellite\'s equator\nto radiate beacon transmissions, and two antenna-like booms\nsupport probes for use in several of the onboard experiments.\nThe 50-inch-diameter by 42-lnch-high spacecraft will be\nlaunched in an elliptical polar orbit - 300 statute miles at\nits nearest (perigee) and 2,200 statute miles at its farthest\n(apogee) points from Earth.\nThe satellite\'s 10 experiments and expanded facilities\nhave necessitated power requirements considerable greater than\nthose employed in its predecessors. A new feature, designed\nfor the ISIS spacecraft series, is a spin and attitude system\nto control spin action in space and also to control the\nattitude of the spacecraft relative to the Sun and the Earth.\n/\nNASA has provided final thermal and environmental prelaunch testing facilities and associated manpower at the\nGoddard Space Plight Center, Greenbelt, Md.\n\n-more-\n\n-8-\n\nISIS-A EXPERIMENTS\n\nISIS-A is a more complex spacecraft than the Alouettes\nI and II, and shows the evolution of the program from a\ntopside\' sounder to virtually an observatory class satellite.\nAlouette I is conducting four experiments and Alouette II has\nfive experiments. The ten experiments carried by ISIS-A are:\nDRTE Experiments;\n\n* .A swept high frequency sounder to probe the ionosphere\nover great distances.\n* A fixed frequency sounder to probe the ionosphere at six\nspecific frequencies.\n* A radio noise experiment to measure ionospheric and\nextraterrestrial radio noise in the outer atmosphere.\n* A special radio receiver for measuring the very low\nfrequency (VLP) signals generated by lightning flashes\nand other natural phenomena. Artificial generation of\nsome of these phenomena will also be attempted by a\ngenerator in the satellite. In addition, a VLP exciter\nwill stimulate resonances in the plasma, the area in\nthe upper atmosphere comprising many gaseous components,\nenveloping and in the immediate vicinity of the orbiting\nspacecraft.\nNASA Experiment:\n\n* A cylindrical electrostatic probe to measure the temperature and concentrations of electrons near the\nspacecraft.\nNational Research Council of Ganada Experiment;\n* Detectors of energetic particles to provide data which\nwill aid in the understanding of:\n- the mechanism responsible for the production and control of the particles which populate the outer\nradiation zone and which sometimes precipitate into\nthe atmosphere;\n- the related problem of entry into the Earth\'s magnetic field of solar and other particles, and\n- the general distortions which occur in the Earth\'s\nmagnetosphere as a result of its interaction with\nthe solar wind.\n-more-\n\n-9USAF Cambridge Research Laboratories Experiments:\n* A detector (ion mass spectrometer) that Identifies the\ntypea of positively charged particles In the vlolnlty\nof the satellite, such as protons, oxygen lona and\nhelium Ions, and\n* A three-Inch spherical electrostatic probe, fitted to\nthe end of a boom that projects from the main body\nof the satellite, to measure the temperature numbers\nand density of positively charged particles (ions).\nUniversity of Western Ontario Experiment;\n* A radio beacon whose transmissions when received at a\nground station will give information about ionospheric\nstructure and irregularities.\nU.S. Southwest Center for Advanced Studies Experiment;\n* A detector of particles with somewhat lower energies,\nsuch as the electrons that precipitate out of the\nupper atmosphere and cause visual auroral displays.\n\n-more-\n\n-10DIPFERENCES FROM THE EARLIER IONOSPHERE SATELLITES\n\nThe ISIS A ionospheric sounder resembles closely that\ncarried by Alouette II. The frequency coverage has been\nextended however, because the satellite will be launched\ninto a higher orbit and later in the solar epoch. Similarly,\ntransmitter power has also been increased.\nThe fixed frequency sounder is a new experiment in\nthe ISIS series to study irregularities in the ionosphere\'s\nhorizontal plane. Essentially, the difference between the\ntwo sounder experiments is that the swept frequency sounder\nwill sample at the same frequency at intervals of about 200\nkilometers or 108 nautical miles whereas the fixed frequency\nsounder will sample at intervals of about 0.27 kilometers or\n0.14 nautical miles.\nThe VLF experiment will include a swept frequency transmitter to stimulate resonances among ions similar to those\npreviously reported with electrons at higher frequencies.\nBecause some high latitude ionospheric phenomena\nappear to depend on low energy electrons, the lower energy\nlimit of electron detection has been reduced in the energetic\nparticle experiment from that carried in Alouette II.\nMore information regarding ion density and temperature\nwill be gained from the ion probe experiment and ion masses\nwill be determined by the ion mass spectrometer. Two instruments for this experiment will permit measurements to\nbe taken along the satellite velocity vector at all latitudes,\nThe beacon designed by the University of Western\nOntario will measure scintillations, particularly in the\nauroral zone.\n\n-more-\n\nIS IS-A FACILITIES\n\nAttitude Sensing\n\n3 axis magnetometer\nThermistors\nSolar aspect sensor\n\nAttitude Control\n\nSpin maintenance and spin axis\nattitude control by magnetic\ntorqulng\n\nTracking Beacon\n\n250 mW\n\nTelemetry\n\n4W FM 100 KHz bandwidth\n2W PCM/PM 50 KHz bandwidth\n4W 400 MHz 500 KHz bandwidth, for\n\nfast playback of tape recorder, or\ndirect transmission of sounder or\n\nVLF experiment.\nCommand\n\n216 possible commands\nProgrammer: 5 commands can be\nstored together with their times of\nexecution.

Because Alouette II\nemploys the same spaceframe as Alouette I, there would have\nbeen no room for data storage, quite apart from the\'lack of\ntime available for development. Despite the large number\nof ground stations available for data collection, however,\nthere are large areas around the world from which data reception is unavailable.\nIt was decided, therefore, to fill these gaps by\ndata storage facilities within ISIS A, and its speciallydeveloped tape recorder will be capable of storing information\nsimultaneously from all experiments. \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\nData storage has necessitated other changes in the\nspacecraft\'s facilities. The experiments and the tape\nrecorder must be able to be switched on when the spacecraft\nis out of range of any ground stations. Consequently, a\nprogrammer is provided capable of storing five commands as\nwell as the times at which each is to be implemented. Each\ncommand may be selected from a list of 10 of those most\ncommonly employed. A clock will make it possible to switch\non the tape recorder at any desired time. The actual time\nat which data is obtained will also be recorded and the clock\nwill be reset.\nThe telemetry requirement has been altered also as a\nresult of data storage requirements. If the number of data\nlinks had remained the same as in the Alouette satellites,\ndata would be gathered from a specific location at the expense\nof data at the station where the recorded information will be\nreceived. An extra link in ISIS A will obviate this shortcoming.\nIn order to receive all the information stored in the\ntape recorder during one pass, this additional data link is\nwide-band - 400 MHz link with a bandwidth of 500 KHz. It\nwill be used as well to transmit the sounder or VLF data in\nthe event of trouble with the wide-band 136 MHz link whose\ntransmitters have been duplicated in the spacecraft.\nIn the predecessor Canadian satellites, data from\nexperiments other than the sounder or VLP and also housekeeping information are transmitted in continuous form by\nemploying frequency multiplexing. In ISIS A, these data\nwill be time multiplexed using pulse code modulation. This\nchange in the telemetry system should make automatic data reduction simpler at the ground centers concerned.\n-more-\n\n-13, While the attitude sensing Instrumentation will be\nsimilar to that on Alouette II, attitude control has been\nincorporated in ISIS A.\nAlouette I has shown marked changes In the attitude\nof its spin axis and rapid decay in its spin rate. The spin\naxis attitude changes can be explained by a combination of\ngravity gradient effects on the long antennas and magnetic\nmovement of the spacecraft - the excessive spin rate decay\nis due to thermal bending of the antennas. These factors\ncause the spacecraft\'s centre of pressure to be displaced\nfrom its centre of gravity and solar radiation pressure is\nthen able to exert a decelerating torque. On ISIS A,therefore, spin rate will be controlled by magnetic torquing to\nwithin the limits of 1 and 3 rpm while spin axis attitude\nwill also be capable of being modified.\nTo meet the requirements of ISIS A extra transmitters,\nmore antennas are required. A quadraloqp antenna is mounted\naround the midsection of the spacecraft and an annular slot\nhas been cut in the section which is the top of the spacecraft at launch.\nAdditional experiments and facilities require Increased\npower supplies. ISIS A\'s more than 11,000 solar cells will\nbe capable of providing five hours per day of full spacecraft operations under minimum Sun conditions after a year in\norbit, providing of course, the known radiation environment\ndoes not change.\nISIS A prime contractor is the RCA Victor Co., Ltd.,\nMontreal, Canada, under supervision of the DRTE.\n\n-more-\n\n-13a-\n\ne\n.2\n4-i\ncd\n\no.\n\n0)\nCO\n\no\n\n0)\n\no\n\nOS\n\na,\n\nCO\n\n0)\n*\xe2\x80\x94(\n\no\n\nCD\n\n-more-\n\n-13b-\n\nFAIRING\n\nTHIRD STAGE\na\n\nSPACECRAFT FITTING\n\nF W - 4 D MOTOR\n\nSPACECRAFT FAIRING\nSPIN TABLE\n\nTRANSPONDER\nGUIDANCE\nCOMPARTMENT\n\nRANGE SAFETY\nANTENNA\n\nSECOND STAGE\nSECOND\n\nGYROSCOPE ASSY\n\nFUEL TANK\n\nOXIDIZES TANK\n\nNITROGEN SPH\xc2\xa3RES(6)\n\nSTAGE\n\nPROPULSION SYSTEM\nBTL ANTENNA\n\nAJIO-II8E THHUST\nCHAMBER A S S Y\nJ92IINTERFACE\nCONNECTOR\n\nTRANSITION\nSECTION\n\nATTITUDE AND\nROLL CONTROL\nSYSTEM\n\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER\n\nADAPTER SECTION\nINVERTER\nCONTROL BATTERY\nRANGE SAFETY\n\nRATE GYRO\nDISTRIBUTION BOX\n\nANTENNA\nAC DISTRIBUTION BOX\n\nCENTER\nBODY SECTION\n\nKlHST STAGE\n\nPITCH ft YAW\nRATE GYRO\nRANGE SAFETY\nRECEIVER\nCO" LEVEL LOX\nFLOAT SWITCH\n\nLIQUID OXYGEN\nTANK\n\nOXIDIZER TANK\n\nSOLID MOTOR\nNOSE FAIR\n\nSOL ID MOTOR\nATTACH BAND\n\nSOLID MOTOR\n\nVERNIER ENGINE\nFIRST STAGE ENGINE\n\nImproved Delta Launch Vehicle\n\n-more-\n\n-14DKLTA LAUNCH ROCKET\n\nThe ISIS A will be launched by NASA\'s Thrust Augmented\nImproved Delta rocket.
