The principles are: the mental energy that supplies task performance (resources), the resulting cross-talk between tasks as they are made more similar (confusion), the combination of different task elements (integration), and the way in which one task is processed and another is ignored (selection or tunneling). The introduction of greater levels of complexity into the validation of attentional theories in order to approach the demands of the cockpit or ATC console is proposed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19880055761, "endDate": "1987-04-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Symposium on Aviation Psychology", "location": "Columbus, OH", "id": "b4586532b5534420a9cfbbc1d5561d7b", "startDate": "1987-04-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880055761, "id": "a7f3d61bec1c4588a4fde2fcf09213ab", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
