The field of Human Factors applies knowledge of human characteristics for the design of safer, more effective, and more efficient systems. This work is in several areas of the human space program: (1) Human-System Integration (HSI), (2) Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle, (3) Extravehicular Activity (EVA), (4) Lunar Surface Systems, (5) International Space Station (ISS), and (6) Human Research Program (HRP). After detailing the work done in these areas, the facilities that are available for human factors work are shown.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110004034, "id": "46d44287d788468abc354789e4add593", "publicationDate": "2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110004034.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110004034/downloads/20110004034.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110004034/downloads/20110004034.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110004034/downloads/20110004034.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
