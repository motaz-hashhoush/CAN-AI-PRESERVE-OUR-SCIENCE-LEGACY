The propellant tank had a diameter of 1.39 meters (4.57ft). The MLI consisted of two blankets of insulation; each blanket contained 15 double-aluminized Mylar radiation shields separated by double silk net spacers. Nineteen tests simulating basic cryogenic spacecraft thermal (environmental) conditions were conducted. These tests typically included initial helium purge, liquid-hydrogen fill and ground-hold, ascent, space-hold, and repressurization. No significant degradation of the space-hold thermal performance due to thermal cycling was noted.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780020207, "id": "e337c6c4064b45c9b0a85979311ac8c8", "publicationDate": "1978-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780020207.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780020207/downloads/19780020207.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780020207/downloads/19780020207.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780020207/downloads/19780020207.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
