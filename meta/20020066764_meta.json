The substrate has to serve as a two-dimensional template for adatom mounting with a reasonable confinement barrier and also provide electronic isolation, preventing unwanted coupling between independent adatom structures. For excellent structural stability, we demand chemical bonding between the adatoms and substrate atoms, but then good electronic isolation may not be guaranteed. Conditions are clarified for good isolation. Because of the chemical bonding, fundamental adatom properties are strongly influenced: a chain with group IV adatoms having two chemical bonds, or a chain with group III adatoms having one chemical bond is semiconducting. Charge transfer from or to the substrate atoms brings about unintentional doping, and the electronic properties have to be considered for the entire combination of the adatom and substrate systems even if the adatom modes are well localized at the surface.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020066764, "endDate": "1998-11-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Vacuum Society", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "d9309bf30bc34fc399d8062d01e68d05", "id": "10f5c5eb61a54ac586946a963241bbec"}], "name": "45th American Vacuum Society Meeting", "location": "Baltimore, MD", "id": "d9309bf30bc34fc399d8062d01e68d05", "startDate": "1998-11-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020066764, "id": "0270e1d994784824955d247f777b433a", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020066764.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020066764/downloads/20020066764.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020066764/downloads/20020066764.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020066764/downloads/20020066764.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
