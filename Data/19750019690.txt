CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ------------ 12\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe primary objective of this market study was to provide\n\nin-depth field findings relative to the market potential of\nthe Biological Isolation Garment (BIG). Discussion on the\n\nfollowing pages focuses on 1 f ,.o nature and size of the anticipated market, analysis of rl nical acceptability and commercial\n\npotential and conclusions au.l recommendations.\n2.\n\nBACKGROUND\n;.L Product Description\nThe Biological Isolation Garr.ient was originally designed\n\nfor the Apollo Astronauts to wear upon return to earth to avoid\nthe possibility of their contaminating the environment. \t\n\nThe\n\nconcept was then adapted for medical use to protect certain\npatients from env i ronmental contamination and the risk of\n\ninfection. A prototype garment was developed and has been\ntested in clinical u:^- by the National Cancer Institute with\nfavorable results.\nThe BIG consists of a coverall type suit with attached\nmittens and slippers, all made with a penetration resistant\nfabric, "BAR-BAC". The fabric prevents penetration of\nparticles of greater than 0.3 microns in diameter. A separate\n\nhood with a transparent face mask is attached to the suit.\nThe entire garment is easily sterilized. Air is supplied\nthrough a diffuser at the top of the head; a flexible tube\nconducts conducts the purified air from the filter/blower to\nthe head piece. The filter/blower system consists of a\nreplaceable HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter\ncartridge unit powered by rechargable batteries and a blower\nmotor. Particles of gr--ater than 0.3 microns in diameter are\nfiltered w\'th 99.9977, accuracy. Positive pressure is maintained\n\n\'in order to prevent entry of unfiltered air into the suit.\n\nThe filter system weighs 5.5 pounds; the blower motor weighs\n0.43 pounds. A manual blower system is provided in the event\nof power system failure.\nIt is anticipated that the BIG could be sold commercially\nfor approximately $1000 to $2000, depending on production\nquantities and possible design variables.\n2.2 Nature of Use\nBiological Isolation Garment\n\nThe scope of this study was limited to medical applications\nin which a patient is subject to a high degree of risk of\ninfection from the normal hospital environment, either as a\nresult of a disease itself or treatment of a disease. For\nthese applications, the Biological Iso\'ation Garment must be\nused in conjunction with a statio:.ary sterile environment such\nas a laminar air flow patient isolator. The B1G then becomes\nan extension of the controlled environment, allowing patients\nto leave the confines of the isolation unit while still being\nt^-w \'.ntained in a controlled environment, Egress from the\nisolator may be required for treatment in other parts of the\nhospital (i.e., x-ray, radiotherapy). In addition, the BIG\nwould enable a patient to more closely interact with\nvisitors or simply break the monotony of isolation, factors\nwhich may be very important for patients psychologically less\nable to tolerate an extended period of isolation.\nIn summary, the BIG i n its present design is an adjunct\nto a patient isolation system and as such, has no clinical\napplication other than as an extension of a protected environment. Thus, in order to determine the commercial potential\nof the BIG, nature and extent of use of patient isolators must\nfirst be assessed.\n\nI\n\nw\n\n2\n\nr\n\nPatien t Isolators\nThe term v atient isolator, a facility in which a patient\nis protected from the hospital environment, generally refers\nto a controlled environment in which the air supply is received\nthrough HEPA filters. Most have laminar air flow, where the\nentire body of air within the confined space moves with\nuniform velocity over parallel flow lines. The basic protective capability of this concep. is the fact that airborne\norganisms cannot migrate against an air flow. The incoming\nair flow is filtered by means of HEPA filte-s, ensuring\nprotection against organisms of greater that 0.3 micron in\ndiameter. The patient care area is maintained at a slightly\nhigher pressure; any air leakage is thus outward rather than\ninward\t\n\nA nearly sterile environment is maintained by:\n- Thorough cleaning of units before they are\nreoccupied\n- Patients must undergo extensive decontamination\nprocedures prior to isolation\n- All equipment and material entering the room\nmust be sterilized.\n- Procedure or method to allow medical staff access\nto patient without contaminating the environment\n\nLamtnar flow rooms have been Used for rr .J.ent care for\nover six years; operating room facilities 1 \t\n\nbeen in existence\n\nfor nearly 10 years. Laminar flow and ultra-clean facilities\nare also used in industry; however, these applications are\nbeyond the scope of the study. Both portable and stationary\nlaminar air flow rooms are commercially available; designs\nare available for use in existing single hospital rooms and\nwards. Most are single patient units, althougli multiple bed\nunits are available.\n\n3\n\nOF\n\nLaminar flow facilities range in price from $5,000 to\n$30,000 depending on ancillary equipment, size, configuracion,\netc. The significant cost of the isolators is, however,\noperating rather than acquisition coat. In a 1972 study conducted\nb y Arthur D. Little, Inc, for the National Cancer Institute,\nit was estimated that the operating cost for one research\nU,\n\nunit studied was approximately $800 per patient da y . In a\nfour-bed lamina: flow unit, costs were estimated at $200 to\n$300 additional per patient day over the cost of conventional\nhospital rooms.\nTypical clin-Lcal applications for patient isolators\ninclude:\n- Chemotherapy/leukemia treatment\n- Transplantation\n- Burns\n- Radiation injury\n- Immune disease\n- Intensive care units\n- Respiratory disease\n- Pediatric isolation\nThe clinical objective in reverse isolation is to protect\nhospital patients who are highly vulnerable to infection from\nthe environment. This is a very severe problem for certain patients:\nfor examp le, infectious comp lications are responsible for nearly\n70% of all deaths in acute leukemia. This susceptibility may\nbe caused by a number of factors, for example:\n- Administration of immuno-suppressive drugs as\nin organ or mar-.ow transplants or for patients\nwith acute \'_euJKemia\n- Impair+nent of natural immunity and/or bone marrow\nfunction- as in intensive chemotherapy and radiation\ninjury\n\n\t\n4\n\na 1\n\n- Consequence of condition itself, as combined\nimmcne deficiency and aplastic anemia\n- Result of severe trauma, as with burns or\nextensive surgery.\nWhere impairment of natural immunitv is induced as part of a\ntreatment protocol as in 2hemotherapy or transplantation,\nevidence indicates that reverse isolation may enable the\nphysician to administer more therapeutic agents while still\nnot significantly increasing risk of infection, a usual\ncomplicating factor of such treatment.\nAlthough the reverse isolation facilities for patient\ncare have been in hospital use for a significant period of\ntime, many authorities still consider them to be at the\nexpe rie mental or research stage. Their benefit and efficacy\nis still a point of controversy. Isolation in a bacteria\nfree environment may be a significant contribution to the\nhealth care needs of certain hospital patients or it may provide\nlittle or no substantial benefit. For example, the conclusion\nof a recent study of this issue concluded that while laminar\nair flow facilities are a promising research tool and the\nevidence is clear that their use can reduce morbidity and\nmortality, the ultimate utility of isolation rooms in\nenhancing long term survival for a significant number of\npatients has not been established.\nSurgical or operating room units have received more widespread acceptance; use is especially prevalent for orthopedic\nsurgical procedures such as total hip replacement. It is\nestimated that there are approximately 1500 operating room\nunits currently in use.\n\n* F. Drazen, A. Levine, "Laminar Air flow Rooms", Hospitals\nVol. 48, Jan. 1, 1974.\n\n2. 3 Market Need/Acceptance\nIn general, the medical community tends to be slow in\nadonting new items of technology unless the advantages and\nbenefits are very clear" demonstrated. The benefits of\nreverse isolation apparently have not been p:-oven beyond doubt,\nand therefore the probability of widespread adoption in the\nnear term is uncertain.\nThe benefit; and advantages of the BIG, a complementary\ndevice must thus be clearly demonstrated as well. If reverse\nisolation becomes a common treatment method, clinical accept\xc2\xa3, nce and use of the BIG will. then depend upon factors such\nas the following:\n- Adv..ntage over current practice\n- Benefits in terms of expanded treatment possibilities\n- Acceptance of garment\'s reliability\n- Patient attitudes towards wearing the garment\n- Anticipated frequency of use\n- Price and operating/maintenance cost\n3. SIZE O1\' THE MARKET\n3.1 Patient Isolators\nIn order to determine the commercial potential of the\nBiological Isolation Garment, the current and future extent of\nuse of patient care laminar flow rooms will be assessed.\nBased on available data, we estimate that approximately 160 to\n200 laminar flow patient isolators have been purchased for\ndomestic use to date. Slip_htly less than half have been\npurchased by U.S. Cancer Centers; the remainder are in general\nand other government hospitals. Of the seventeen cancer centers,\n\n6\n\nFNP""M"\n^^r\n\ntwelve are reported to have patient isolator units, an average\nof over five units per center. However, M.D. Anderson\n(University of Texas), one of the original cancer centers,\nreportedly has 26 units; if this is discounted, the average\nper cancer center drops to approximately three to four.\n\nHospitals other than c- l scer centers have an average of two\nunits each. Overall, our research indicates that nearly half\nof the total units are used primarily for chemotherapy/acute\nleukemia treatment.\nThe adoption of patient isolators has been slow. Moreover,\npurchases by general and other hospitals appears to be\ndiminishing: only 1/3 of the total were purchased after 1972.\nU.S. cancer centers, however, have increased their acquisition\nof units over the last three years.\nThe market for patient isolators is dominated by three\nsuppliers, who account for over 75% of sales. Several firms\nwho supplied units in the past have gone out of business or\nhave eliminated or de-emphasized hospital sales. The market\nhas been difficult to develop and expand because of factors\n\nsuch as:\n-\n\nLarge research expense associated with manufacturing\n\n- High cost of sales to a geographically disbursed market\n- Long sales lead time\n- Medical community tend to regard isolation units as a\nresearch item\n3.2 Biological Isolation Garment\nThe maximum size of the current market- for the Biological\n\nIsolation Garment for medical use is li^.ii-ted to the patient\nisolation facilities currently in place (assuming that they are\nutilized). One garment would be required per patient unit,\nsince the garment can be sterilized between patients.\n\n7\n\nThe current market for the Biolog\'cal Isolation Garment\nis thus 1.60-200 units, the number of patient isolators in\n\nplace (the majority are one patient facilities). At an\nestimated sales price of $1000 t . $2000 per garment, the\n\nr%,\n\nmaximum current market is approximately $160,000 to $400,000.\nSince the BIG has been successfully tested in clinical use,\nit is likely that adoption of the garment may be relatively\nrapid, at minimum an estimated one garment per hospital, or\napproximately 60 units within one to two years after commercialization.\nFuture sales potential could expand considerably if the\npatient isolation concept is accepted as standard practice\nby the medical community. It is virtually impossible to\npredict when this will occur.\n4. COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION\n4.1 C:ompetitiv%.^ Environment\nDuring the course of our research, we identified no\n\ncommercially available products to provide a mobile sterile\nenvironment for patients confined to isolator units. If it is\nnecessary to remove the patient from the isolator, (for example,\nfor treatment in another part of the hospital) current practice\nis to dress the patient in a sterile surgical gown and mask\nin order to minimize risk of infection. Alternatively, the\nproblem is often circui;ivented by bringing portable equipment\nwhich has been decontaminated into the isolator.\n4.2 Channels of Distribution\nThe most appropriate channel of distribution for the BIG\nwould be direct sales contact either through a company sales\nfore or through distributors with established hospital\ncontacts.\t\n\n8\n\nDirect sales contact is commonly used for patient\n\nisolators, and since the items are complementary, greatest\nsales q uccess would likely be achieved if sold together.\n5. COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL\nAt\n\n5.1 Market Penetration\nApproximately one to two years would be required for a\nnew company to develop the necessary sales and manufacturing\ncapabilities to produce and commercialize the Biological\nIsolation Garment. This time could possibly be reduced,\nhowevever, by a company adding the BIG to an existing line\nof patient isolators or hospital products.\nAssuming that more widespread adoption of patient\nisolators occurs, expected sales of the BIG would also depend\nup on factors such as the following:\ny\n- Magnitude of sales effort\n- Price at which the BIG can be sold\n- Operation and maintenance cost\n- Patient acceptance of BIG\n- Development of non-medical applications\n5.2 Price/ Performance Impact\nThe sales price --)f the Biological Isolation Garment is\ndifficult to specify at this time, but it is anticipated\nthat it could be sold for approximately $1000 to $2000 depending\non design and production variables. Price/performance impact\nmust thus be assessed in terms of the incremental benefit of\nthe BIG to treatment of certain hospital patients. Several\nmanufacturers of patient isolators felt that the market is\nvery cost sensitive, and price would be very important,\nespecially when reverse isolation units are in use less than\n\n9\n\nhalf of the time.\n5.3 Anticipated Market Barriers_\n\nThe primary factors which we foresee as potentially\naffecting market acceptance of the Biological Isolation Garment\n(assuming acceptance of patient isolators) are:\n- Present practices may be considered satisfactory\n- Patient rejection of bulky su!_t\nThe primary means overcoming barriers to acceptance is\ndemonstration and wide dissemination of clinical test results\nand anticipated benefits of the garment. The medical community\nmust first accept the fact that the BIG offers significantly\ngreater protection than present practice end that it would\nbe a useful addition to patient care. Similarly, any objections\nwb,,.tr, 1 patient may have to the appearance and comfort\nvi the garment would be minimized or eliminated if it is\ndemonstrated that risk of infection is reduced or possible\nactivities expanded.\n5.4 Interested Manufacturers\nSeven firms have expressed interest in performing a\ndetailed evaluation of the Biological Isolation Garment to\nexplore manufacturing and sales possibilities. Four firms are\nmanufacturers of patient isolators; the remainder manufacture\nand distribute other hospital supplies and equipment.
