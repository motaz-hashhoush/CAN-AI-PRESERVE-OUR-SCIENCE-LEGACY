The complications which arise in multicell batteries to show how different electrochemistries might alleviate or accentuate these problems is described. The concept of the electrochemical system is introduced to show how certain shortcomings of the single cell/battery string concept can be circumvented. Some of these electrochemical systems permit performance characteristics that are impossible by using conventional battery design philosophies. Projections for energy density and performance characteristics of the concepts are addressed.", "title": "Electrochemical storage", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T00:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840021273, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Thaller, L.
