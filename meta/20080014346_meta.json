Not coincidentally, this period also saw more than its fair share of failure, especially in the infamous \"kaputnik\" days prior to the successful launch of Explorer. Without a standard canon of known quantities to turn to, the early pioneers of rocketry and space flight were forced to dream up new ideas that ranged from the elegant to the bizarre and to accept the fact that the price of radical progress is occasional failure. Nowadays, rapid prototyping and testing have slowed, as we rely more and more on the extensive knowledge pined by our predecessors and on the embarrassment of riches modern engineers get from computational modeling and computer assisted design. In many cases, this leads to much improved or phenomenally more efficient designs. It also, however, fosters a culture so terrified of failure that we over-engineer and overanalyze everything, often tweaking designs for decades before a new system takes flight. (This is not a problem unique to rockets; the same phenomenon seems to have occurred in high-performance jets.) This is one reason why it was possible for President Kennedy to dream of the completion of the Mercury and Gemini missions and a successful landing on the moon in under a decade, while returning to the moon may take nearly twice as long. Lacking access to the tremendous computational resources of the national space program-and, just as importantly, removed from the harsh judgment of public shareholders or congressional appropriations committees-the hungry entrepreneurs who compete for our prizes tend not to display such fear of failure. Instead, most of them follow a rapid \"build, test, fly\" program. They are willing to throw a handful of concepts against the wall and see what sticks. They often go from drawing on the back of a napkin to firing engines or even flying vehicles in a matter of weeks or months, learning valuable lessons along the way. Indeed, our teams have repeatedly learned many of the most valuable lessons after only a few moments of working with real hardware-lessons that could never have been learned from a CAD drawing, like finding the failure modes of different welding practices or tracking down the interference between an onboard camera and a GPS unit. As Paul Breed, the leader of a Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge team (playfully called Unreasonable Rocket), is fond of saying, \"In computer simulations the plumbing never leaks. In real life, it always does.\"", "title": "Learning from Space Entrepreneurs", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T05:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080014346, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pomerantz, William"}, "organization": {"name": "Northrop Grumman Corp.", "location": "United States"}}, "id": "07d491ee65744011bb50d80e3aa3dff3"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080014346, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080014346, "id": "3d43d359861f465aac9bf66a1a769556", "publicationName": "Ask Magazine", "publicationDate": "2008-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20080014343, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Ask Magazine", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080014346.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080014346/downloads/20080014346.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080014346/downloads/20080014346.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080014346/downloads/20080014346.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
