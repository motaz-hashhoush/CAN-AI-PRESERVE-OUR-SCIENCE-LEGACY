b'Mechanics/Machinery\nReusable Hot-Wire Cable Cutter\nThis device can be used to cut any type of small synthetic cable.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nDuring the early development stage of\nballoon deployment systems for missions, nichrome wire cable cutters were\noften used in place of pyro-actuated cutters. Typically, a nichrome wire is\nwrapped around a bundle of polymer cables with a low melting point and connected to a relay-actuated electric circuit. The heat from the nichrome\nreduces the strength of the cable bundle, which quickly breaks under a mechanical load and can thus be used as a\nrelease mechanism for a deployment system. However, the use of hand-made\nheated nichrome wire for cutters is not\nvery reliable. Often, the wrapped\nnichrome wire does not cut through the\ncable because it either pulls away from\nits power source or does not stay in contact with the cable being cut. Because\nnichrome is not readily soldered to copper wire, unreliable mechanical crimps\nare often made to connect the nichrome\nto an electric circuit.\nA self-contained device that is\nreusable and reliable was developed to\nsever cables for device release or deployment. The nichrome wire in this new device is housed within an enclosure to\nprevent it from being damaged by handling. The electric power leads are internally connected within the unit to the\nnichrome wire using a screw terminal\nconnection. A bayonet plug, a quick and\nsecure method of connecting the cutter\nto the power source, is used to connect\nthe cutter to the power leads similar to\nthose used in pyro-cutter devices.\n\nThe Reusable Hot-Wire Cable Cutter installed on a deployment line.\n\nA small ceramic tube [0.25-in. wide\n0.5-in. long (\xe2\x89\x886.4-mm wide 13-mm\nlong)] houses a spiraled nichrome wire\nthat is heated when a cable release action\nis required. The wire is formed into a spiral coil by wrapping it around a mandrel.\nIt is then laid inside the ceramic tube so\nthat it fits closely to the inner surface of\nthe tube. The ceramic tube provides\nsome thermal and electrical insulation so\nthat most of the heat generated by the\nwire is directed toward the cable bundle\nin the center of the spiral. The ceramic\ntube is cemented into an aluminum\nblock, which holds it in position. The\nleads of the nichrome wire are attached\nto screw terminals that connect them to\npower leads. A bayonet plug mounted at\nthe bottom of the rectangular block connects the power leads to a relay circuit. A\n\nthin aluminum shell encloses the entire\nstructure, leaving access points to attach\nto the bayonet plug and to feed a cable\ninto the cylinder. The access holes for\nthe deployment cable are a smaller diameter than the nichrome coil to prevent\nthe cable from coming in direct contact\nwith the nichrome when loaded.\nIt uses the same general method of\nsevering a cable with a heated wire as was\nused previously, but implements it in\nsuch a way that it is more reliable and\nless prone to failure. It creates a mechanism to create repeatability that was\nnonexistent in the previous method.\nThis work was done by Michael T. Pauken\nand Joel M.

Such\ndeployable trusses could also be useful in\nterrestrial applications such as the rapid\nestablishment of structures in military and\nemergency service situations, in particular\n\nwith regard to the deployment of enclosures for habitat or storage. To minimize\nthe time required to deploy such an enclosure, a single arch-shaped truss is\npreferable to multiple straight trusses\n\n17\n\n'
