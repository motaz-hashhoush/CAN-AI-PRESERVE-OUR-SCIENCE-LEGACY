Isotopic ratios for Ar, Kr, and Xe were found to be atmospheric. Their elemental abundances were high relative to published data, owing to the effect of shock implantation in the crushing step, as was verified in a supplementary experiment. No Ne was detected above the blank level. The He-3 was exceptionally abundant, while He-4 was exceptionally depleted, possibly due to the acid wash. The He-3/He-4 ratio was anomalously high at an R/Ra value of 246 + or - 16. The results support the hypothesis that the He-3 excess in diamonds is cosmogenic.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "53", "submissionId": 19890066928, "issn": "0016-7037", "id": "ed45a5d9b29d46f4a72b6feb2261f80a", "publicationName": "Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta", "publicationDate": "1989-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
