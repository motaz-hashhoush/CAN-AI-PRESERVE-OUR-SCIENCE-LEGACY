If verified and exploited, these volatiles will revolutionize spaceflight as an inexpensive source of propellants and other consumables outside Earth's gravity well. This report discusses a preliminary investigation of a method to insert a sensor through such a soiVice mixture to verify the presence, nature, and concentration of the ice. It uses percussion to deliver mechanical energy into the frozen mixture, breaking up the ice and decompacting the soil so that only low reaction forces are required from a rover or spacecraft to push the sensor downward. The tests demonstrate that this method may be ideal for a small platform in lunar gravity. However, there are some cases where the system may not be able to penetrate the icy soil, and there is some risk ofthe sensor becoming stuck so that it cannot be retracted, so further work is needed. A companion project (ISDS for Water Detection on the Lunar Surface) has performed preliminary investigation of a dielectric/thermal sensor for use with this system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110014970, "id": "bb7801f5cbee4fa5b133f749b2e8fd5a", "publicationDate": "2011-07-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110014970.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110014970/downloads/20110014970.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110014970/downloads/20110014970.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110014970/downloads/20110014970.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
