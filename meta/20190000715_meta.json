Private package delivery companies and government agencies have an interest in vehicles that have large payload to weight ratios; thus allowing to deliver heavy payloads. Currently, UAS configurations suffer from propulsive and aerodynamic limitations that decrease the payload weight and/or mission range. In order to decrease these limitations, the Kinetic and Potential Energy Alternation for Greater Lift Enhancement (KP EAGLE) concept provides a novel way to transport payloads that may be too heavy for vehicles in a similar weight class. The concept vehicle takes off vertically without the payload. It then performs a dive maneuver that transfers the gained potential energy into kinetic energy to pick up the payload. This concept does not require special equipment during takeoff or landing and provides a better payload to weight ratio than other conventional vehicles in the same weight class.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Brazil", "submissionId": 20190000715, "endDate": "2018-09-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Engenharia e Ci\u00eancias Mec\u00e2nicas (ABCM)", "location": "Rio de Janerio, Brazil"}}, "meetingId": "7a3f0dcf1dc24f27bc6cd5e40c3e557c", "id": "9b5ffc1dbf7b4f64ac27632c311a134e"}], "name": "Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences", "location": "Belo Horizonte", "id": "7a3f0dcf1dc24f27bc6cd5e40c3e557c", "startDate": "2018-09-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190000715, "id": "75abe4ab6cef4b89a25e6d8db03375bb", "publicationDate": "2018-08-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190000715.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190000715/downloads/20190000715.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190000715/downloads/20190000715.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190000715/downloads/20190000715.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
