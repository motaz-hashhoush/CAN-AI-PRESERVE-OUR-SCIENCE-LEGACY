Fundamental observations of gravitation, relativity, and factors related to the solar interior, measurements of the static and dynamic electromagnetic fields and the particle populations close to the sun, and observations of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the corona with high spatial resolution would be possible with the Starprobe. A determination of the quadrupole coefficient in the expansion of the gravitational potential field of the sun is noted to be possible by measuring the departure from a Keplerian orbit of the Starprobe as it passes perihelion, yielding data on the rate of revolution of the interior of the sun. Further information on shock acceleration, energy losses, radio bursts, interplanetary propagation, and diffusion will be available at 10-60 solar radii.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19820038516, "endDate": "1982-01-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "7539649dfa03455696a74ae8c85e9af0", "id": "b1bc08e275c44d3dba88b99d232d0dd1"}], "name": "Aerospace Sciences Meeting", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "7539649dfa03455696a74ae8c85e9af0", "startDate": "1982-01-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820038516, "id": "17eabe30a49b452d8bee64d2b3f6da10", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
