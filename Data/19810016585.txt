One of them, NOAA-6, is still operational,\nwhile the other, TIROS-N, failed after operating twice its design\nlife of 14 months, and was turned off on Feb. 21, 1981.\nNOAA-C will be launched atop an Atlas-F by an Air Force\nlaunch team from the Western Space and Missile Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Lompoc, Calif. its design life is about two\nyears.\nThe improved sea surface temperature; computed from sensor\nreadings returned to Earth, will be of special value to fishermen\noff the West Coast and in the Gulf of Alaska, and to marine shipping companies in the Gulf of Mexico and along the East Coast.\nCommercial fishermen in California, Oregon, Washington and\nAlaska use sea surface temperature charts compiled from satellite\ninfrared imagery and data to locate the most productive .fishing\ngrounds for those species which are water temperature ,sensitive.\nCatches of salmon, albacore and herring have been improved, and\nfuel costs reduced many fishermen report.\nCan the other side of the continent, along the East Coast and\nin the Gulf of Mexico, shipping interests use charts showing the\nGulf Strea.n and Gulf Loop Current, also derived from satellite\nobservation:.\n-more-\n\nd\n\nJ\n\n-3Oil tankers, tugs towing barges and other vessels take advan-\n\ntage of, or avoid, the swifter currents, reducing transit time and\nsaving fuel. One towing and transportation company operating 60\nvessels in the Caribbean estimates fuel savings of 20 to 40 percent by incorporating the stream and loop current information into\nits fuel conservation program.\n\nThe new satellite,\n\nNOAA-C,\n\nalso will carry a joint Air Force-\n\nNASA experimental instrument aloft to monitor possible contamination of the environment in the immediate vicinity of the spacecraft resulting from its propulsion systems. Such contamination,\nif it exists, could degrade the performance of future instruments\nplanned for launch aboard satellites similar to NOAA-C.\nWith the successful launch of NOAA-C, two polar-orbiting\nsatellites will be circling the globe, returning weather and environmental information to NOAA\'s National Earth Satellite Service. Each spacecraft\t\n\nNOAA-6 and the new, improved version --\n\nwill view virtually all of the Earth\'s ,surface from about 805\nkilometers (500 miles) in space at least twice every 24 hours.\n\nData and imagery from the polar orbiters, as well as from two\ngeostationary orbiting spacecraft operated by NOAA, routinely are\nused by the agency\'s National Weather Service.\nInstruments aboard the polar-orbiters take atmospheric soundings, measurements in vertical "slices" of the atmosphere showing\ntemperature profiles, water vapor amounts and the total ozone con-\n\ntent from the Earth\'s surface to the top of the atmosphere.\n\n-more`ppy\n\n1\n\nev\n\n. .\n\n_.a\'\t\n\nu\'=a, .o.. ..\t\n\n.,r.\t\n\n.r.,\t\n\ni. ^\',a 4nL,-,.._\xe2\x80\xa2^-_:\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\'``G^. ^`LY^"` w ..,.aa.\t\nw,xi\'w.t\n\n_\n\n-4-\n\nThe sounding data are especially important in producing\nglobal weather analyses and forecasts at the Weather\n\nSe,rvimu,"\n\nNational Meteorological Censer. And these advisories are vital\nto accurate continental, regional and local weather forecasts.\nIn addition to imagine the Earth and obtaining atmospheric\nsoundings, the TIROS-N series satellites also collect environ-inental observations from remote data platforms -- such readings as\nwave heights on the oceans, water levels in mountainou,,4 streams,\ntidal activity and the like. These versatile spacecraft also monitor solar particle radiation In space, used, in part, to warn\nmanned space missions and high altitude commercial aircraft\nflights of potentially hazardous solar radiation activity.\nFinally, NOAA-6 and its new space twin hive a communications\nfunction, distributing unprocessed sensor data to Earth stations\nin more than 120 nations in real time as the spacecraft pass\noverhead.\nNOAA-C, as with its predecessors in the TIROS-N series, was\ndesigned and built by RCA Astro Electronics, Princeton, N.J.,\nunder contracts to NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,\nMd., which acts as industry interface for NOAA. Following successful launch and checkout in orbit by NASA, NOAA-7 will be\noperated by NOAA\'s National Earth Satellite Service.\nFour more satellites in the series are scheduled through\n1985, to be launched on a "call up" basis to insure uninterrupted\ndata flow.\nNOAH-C cost approximately $15 million to build, and launch\ncosts will be about $7.5 million.\n(END OF GENERAL RELEASE; BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOLLOWS.)\n-more-\n\n-5-\n\nNOOAA-C MISSION\nNOAA-C is the fourth of eight TIROS-N series operational\n\nmeteorological polar orbiting spacecraft. The purpose of these\nsatellites is to make measurements of temperature and humidity\nin the Earth\'s atmosphere, surface temperature, surface and cloud\ncover, water-ice-moisture boundaries, and proton and electron\nflux near the Earth. They have a capability of receiving, processing and retransmitting data from free-floating balloons,\nbuoys and remote automatic stations distributed around the globe\nand can also track stations which are in motion. In addition,\nthe NOAH-E, -F and -G spacecraft will ,carry a Search and Rescue\ninstrument. All launches are planned for the 1980-85 time\nperiod.\n\nProject Objectives\nNOAA-C objectives include collection of environmental data\nfor use in the National Operational. Environmental Satellite System. Specific objectives include providing improved methods of\nobtaining quantitative environmental data and improved data handling capabilities through:\ne High resolution, day and night cloud cover observations\non a local and global scale;\ne High resolution observations of sea surface temperatures;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Improved observations of vertical temperatures and water\nvapor profiles in the troposphere and lower stratosphere\non a global basis;\ne Observations of vertical temperature profiles in the\nmiddle and upper stratosphere on a global basis;\no Operational flight of a high-capacity data collection/\nrelay and platform location system;\no Observations of electron and proton flux densities and\ntotal particle energy densities in the near-Ea::th space\nenvironment.\nThe TIROS-N series is based on the Block 5D spacecraft bus\ndeveloped by RCA Astro Electronics for the Air Force. Differences between the Block 5D and NOAA-C are constrained to those\nnecessary to meet mission requirements or found to be cost\neffective.\nThe launch vehicle for NOAA-C is a modified Atlas-F. Following successful launch, two fully operational satellites will be\nin orbit at one time. A backup satellite will be available for\nlaunch five months after NOAA-C is placed in orbit.\n\n-more-\n\n^k\n\nO\n\nW\n\n>-\t\n\ncc: Woc\t\nUA\n\n^ku\ncc\n\nw\n\nw\t\n\naxz^\n\nwWCD\n\n\xc2\xb0^\n\xe2\x80\x94W\n\na^od mac\n\n^^\n\nJ\t\n\nswim ^F-,vn\nZ\n^ W Lu h\nZw\n=\' Q\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\nw\nz ci fn\n\nO\t\n\nCC Z\n\nj\n\n>>-_ o\n\nz^\n\nQ^ccccc\t\n\nOo\nN\n\nZCC\n!\xe2\x80\x94 p\n\nQ ^`\n\nC7\n\ncow z^\n\nQ;H\n\nSCG.}I\n\n^y\n\n^ z ^\nzp\n\nC7^Q0\t\n\nN\n\n\t\n\n0 ww\n\nwy\n\nmO h\nd\n\nxW\nwzU\n\nV$40\nuj\n\nwQ\n\nR^\n\nV--^^LL - ui\nI--\n\nO") X in \xe2\x80\x94 z\nW\t\n\n^ J\n\n<2H\n\nW\n\nO\n\n\t\n\n^\n\ncc\n\nZZZ\n\nZZQV\t\nCL ui\n: OP < P\t\n\noQ\n\na\n\ncc\n\nQ\n\na0W\na^` z\noLQ\n\nLL J\n\nw\n\xc2\xa9 cn\n}\n\nN\n\nz\n\nmui\n\naWO\ncr\n\ny\n\nox\n\nQ\n\nA\n\nW Uj\n\n>\n\n}Wt\n\na 0. d\n\nz\n\nix\n\nc4~\n\nCL"\n\na0\n\nZ\nQ\n\nOW\n\nW\n\nQ X\n\na\n\nQ O\n\nY^00\n^N VC7^\nww OZyw\n^ W\n\nCC\n\nLLI\n\nWN\n\nJ\n\n20\n\nCD V\n\nJ L^\n\na\n\nt^\n0 Z\n\nz\n\nz\n_ t\nNu\n\nO W xx\nH^ 4 D\n\nQa >.\no\n\n^^_\nQ O\n\n\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\n\n(%\n\nQ\n\n-7-\n\nNOAA-C nominal orbit parameters are:\nOrbit altitude: 870 kilometers (540 miles)\nSun-synchronous inclination: 98.8 degrees\nOrbit period; 102.37 minutes\nInternational Participation\nInternational participants are the United Kingdom, Ministry\nof Defense Meteorological Office (British Met Office); the Republic of France, Centre National d\'Etudes Spatiales (C:NES); and the\nCanadian Department of Communications, Communications Research\nCenter (CRC), in the later phases of the series.\nINSTRUMENTATION\nHigh Resolution Radiometry\nOne of the NOAA objectives for the TIROS-N series is to pro-vide timely day and night sea surface temperature, ice, snow and\ncloud information to diverse classes of users. The instrument:\nused to obtain this data is the Advanced Very High Resolution\nRadiometer/2.\nRequirements include:\n\xc2\xae Direct readout to ground stations of the Automatic Picture Transmission class, worldwide, at low resolution of\n4 km (;.4 mi.) with reduction of panoramic distortion;\na Direct readout to ground stations of the High Resolution\nPicture Transmission class, worldwide. Resolution will\nbe 1 km (.6 mi.);\ne Global Area Coverage of on-board recorded data at relatively low reso",utions of 4 km (2.4 mi.) for central\nprocessing;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Local Area Coverage of on-board storage of data from\nselected portions of each orbit at high resolution of\n1 km (.6 mi.) for central processing.\nIt is NOAA\'s objective to provide sea surface temperatures\nto an accuracy of 1.5 degrees Celsius, absolute and relative (2.7\ndegrees Fahrenheit) on a 10-km (6.2-mi.) grid, at least once per\nday, but hopefully twice, and to an accuracy of 1 degree C absolute on a 100-km (62-mi.) grid at least once per day. Visible\nand near infrared spectral coverage is necessary to meet NOAA\nrequirements for observation of land coverage, delineation of\nwater, of snow and ice, and of melting snow and ice.\n\n-more\n\nNOAA-C\'s radiometer is sensitive in five general regions.\nThe radiometer on earlier TIROS--N series satellites were sensitive in only four. The fifth channel, in the 12 micrometer\nregion, is expected to permit improved sea surf aoe temperature\nreadings.\nData\n\nCollection\n\nSvstem\n\nA data collection and platform location subsystem is required to meet NOAA goals. This subsystem, provides for thereceipt, processing and storage of data (temperature, pressure,\naltitude, etc.) from fined and moving platforms (e.g., freefloating balloons and buoys) and for the location of the moving\nplatforms for Later transmission to a central processing\nfacility.\nPlatform location is used to determine the velocity of the\nfluid medium In which the platform is immersed (i.e., wind velocity in the case of balloons and ocean current at a depth of the\ndrogue in the case of buoys). The accuracy achieved is primarily\na function of the position accuracy for each fix, the time interval between fixes and the representativeness or responsiveness of\nthe "tracer" (e.g., balloon, drogue motion).\nComponents\n\nof the Data Collection System are:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 rree-floating balloon platforms;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Free-floating buoy platforms;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fixed platforms located predominately in polar regions;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The satellite data collection subsystem;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The ground station data retrieval subsystem;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Centralized data reduction and processing.\nAs an c?oerational spacecraft the NOAH-C satellite will receive low-duty cycle transmissions, uncoordinated in time or frequency, from the platforms in a random access manner using a oneway radio frequency link. The received transmission will be processed onboard the satellite in order to recover the platform\ndata message and for the free-floating platforms, to measure the\ntransmission received frequency so that additional ground processing can determine the locations from the Doppler induced frequency shift. The recovered data message and frequency measurements (along with time code) are stored onboard the satellite for\nground station data retrieval at periodic intervals.\n\n-more-\n\n-9-\n\nAtmospheric Sounding\nThe TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder eystem data is used\nto determine the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere\nfrom the Earth\'s surface to near the top of the atmosphere (l\nmillibar) and moisture vapor content profile from the surface to\nthe tropopause. It is a goal to compute these profiles globally\nto an accuracy of l degree C (temperature) and 20 percent moisture vapor content (10 percent desired) on a grid spacing at the\nEarth\'s surface of 400 km (248 mi.) or less, even in the presence\nof clouds.\nAn ozone measurement is necessary for correcting the determinations of the profiles.\nThe primary 9.nstrument providing tropospheric data is the\n\nHigh Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder, which is sensitive\nto energy from the visible to the carbon dioxide region of the\ninfrared spectrum. This instrument prov?,des data permitting calculation of temperature profiles from the surface to 10 mb, water\nvapor content at three levels of the atmosphere and total ozone\ncount. A Stratospheric Sounding Unit, provided by the Meteorological Office of the United Kingdom, is sensitive to energy in\nthe carbon dioxide portion of the infrared spectrum and provides\ntemperature information from the stratosphere. A third instrument, the Microwave Sounding Unit, is sensitive to energy in the\noxygen region of the microwave spectrum and is used in conjunction with the two infrared instruments. The microwave data permits temperature computation to be made in the presence of clouds\nsince measurements in this region are generally unaffected by\nnon-prcci.pitating water droplets.\nSpace Environment Monitor\n\nThe Space Environment Monitor provides continuous measurement of proton alpha and electron flux activity near the Earth.\nThis instrument is an extension of the solar proton monitor previously flown on ITOS satellites. The instrument package additionally provides for measurement of alpha and electron flux,\nspectrum and total energy disposition into the Earth\'s upper\natmosphere.\nContamination Monitor\nThis instrument to be flown only on NOAA-C, was built by\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., for the U.S.\nAir Force. It will obtain contamination data (mass accretion) on\nthe Earth-viewing panel of the equipment support module. in particular, the specific events during which mass accretion will be\nmeasured are solid-rocket motor burn, deployments and hydrazine\nfirings.\n\n-mor e-\n\n_10-\n\nIt also is expected to measure the contamination-induced\n\ndegradation effects on sensitive thermal-control coatings, as\nwell as the magnitude of contamination that may be expected in\nthe general area of a solar backscatter ultraviolet instrument to\nbe down on future spacecraft. Data provided by this instrument\nalso will be used to verify analytical contamination models.\nDATA TRANSMISSION\nThe data handling subsystem consists of four primary com-\n\nponents; the TIROS Information Processor, the Manipulated Information Rate Processor., Digital Tape Recorders and the Cross Strap\nUnit. All data available for transmissitn to the ground are processed by some or all the components. The information processor\nformats all low bit rate instrument and housekeeping telemetry\ndata and controls the data outputs. It processes data from the\nvertical sounder, space environment monitor and data collection\nsystem. The rate processor processes data from the advanced\nradiometer in order to provide separate outputs for Automatic\nPicture Transmission and High Resolution Picture Transmission in\nreal time, recorded Global Area Coverage of reduced resolution\ndata, and recorded Local Area Coverage of high resolution data\nfor command readout at the command and data acquisition stations\nand processing in the NOAA central computer facility at Suitland,\nMd. In addition to f o..matting, the rate processor.\' adds synchronization, identification, time code, telemetry and information\nprocessor output to the advanced ,radiometer.\nTracking and Data Acqu isi tion\n\nTracking and orbit determination support is provided by the\nAir Force. NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center is responsible for\nproviding the orbital information to NOAA and to satisfy NOAA- C\nactivation and evaluation requirements. All data acquisition is\nperformed through NOAA Command and Data Acquisition stations and\ndata links.\nNOAA Command and Data Acquisition Stations -- The primary\nCommand and Data Acquisition stations are ocated at Fairbanks,\nAlaska, and Wallops Station, Va. In addition, there is a reduced\ncapability (limited command capability) station, located at\nLannion, France, to receive Limited volume transmissions of taperecorded data from the satellite and to transmit commands in case\nof an emergency occurring during orbits when the satellite does\nnot pass over a NESS Command and Data Acquisition Station.\nThe acquisition stations transmit command programs to the\nsatellite, acquire and record environmental and engineering data\nfrom the satellite. All data is transmitted between the stations\nand Suitland via commercial communications ,links. Commands are\ntransmitted between NAAA\'s Satellite Operations Control Center\nand the stations via commercial communications links.\n\n-mor e-\n\nfr\'\n\n`lf[,\t\ny\t\n\nas\n\nF\nt;\n11\n\nSpacecraft\nFairin;\nSPacecraft\nNOAA-\'C Orbs.

After launch, the NOAH acquisition stations will\nhandle all telemetry reception. There is normally no requirement\nfor the tracking network to command the spacecraft. The Air\nForce will provide "skin-track" tracking and orbit determination\nsupport during the mission.,\nSPACECRAFT DESCRIPTION\nThe NOAA-C satellite is an integrated spacecraft system designed to provide for, and control injection into, the required\n\norbit; after separation from the Atlas- F Launch vehicle.\nThe spacecraft, including the apogee kick motor, in the\n\nlaunch configuration is 373. centimeters (146 inches) high and\nAd\t\n`9A i\t\nill-_ _- ^ 1v\n._g hs n O ink - i 1_. 40 5 kilo g rams\nin\t\nm\t\n10 0 cm ( 7A +n. , in diame ter and wei g h\n(31097 pounds). On orbit, with the kick motor and reactioncontrol equipment expendables consumed, the satellite has a nominal weight of 723 kg (1 1 594 lb.).\nThe solid rocket apogee kick motor, which performs the orbit\ninjection maneuver, is an integral part of the NOAA-C spacecraft,.\n\nIt contains 664 kg (1 1 464 lb.) of propellant which burns to depletion in 45 seconds, leaving the empty motor assembly case, weighing 50.4 kg (111 lb.), in orbit with the spacecraft. During the\nmotor burn the spacecraft is stabilized by nitrogen and hydrazine\n\nthrusters. The motor, model TE-M-364-15, is manufactured by the\nThiokol Corp., Huntsville, Ala.\n\nThe spacecraft bus consists of the following subsystems:\nstructure-thermal., power, attitude determination and control, and\ncommunications and data handling.\n\nStructure-Thermal. -- The structure is an integrated one consisting of as solar array, an injection motor structure and an\nequipment support module and instrument mounting platform. The\nsatellite thermal control is achieved for all Sun angles between 0\nand 66 degrees, internal maximum power dissipation and for end-ofmission-life conditions. Active and passive thermal control simi-\n\nlar to that used on Block 5D will confine temperature of the internal Satellite-Equipment Interface to a range of 5 to 30 degrees\nC (41 to 86 degrees F) and the instruments to a range of 10 to 30\ndegrees C (50 to 86 degrees F).\n\n-morei\n\ni\n\n-13-\n\nPower Subsystem -- The basic power subsystem is augmented\nwith a second 26.5 ampere-hour battery, and a pulse load bus.\nT ha subsystem is a direct energy transfer type and will provide\n420 watts average power.\nAttitude Determination and Control Subsystem -- The attitude\nsubsystem consists of an inertial measurement unit, a Sun sensor\nunit and Earth sensor assembly, reaction wheels and torque coils.\nAdditional features include a three-axis magnetic moment compensation assembly, to trim out external and internal disturbances,\nand jet wheel unloading capability as a backup mode.\nLAUNCH VEHICLE\nThe NOAA-C spacecraft will be Launched from Space Launch\n\nComplex 3 (SLC-3) at the Air Force Western Space and Missile\n\nCenter, Calif., by a mission-modified Atlas-F launch vehicle\nsupplied by the Air Force. The launch vehicle\'s overall length,\n\nincluding the spacecraft fairing, is 28.1 meters (92.26 feet) .\n\nThe maximum diameter is 3 m (10 ft.). The launch vehicle is\nmanufactured by the General Dynamics Corp., San Diego, Calif.\nBooster and Sustainer Stages\nThe Atlas-F is powered by liquid oxygen (LOX) and a liquid\nhydrocarbon fuel. The booster system consists of two fixed thrust\nengines which are gimL,,Ied to provide pitch, yaw and roll control\nfrom liftoff through booster engine cutoff. The sustainer engine,\nalso fixed thrust, is gimbaled and provides pitch and yaw control\nto the vehicle from just before booster engine cutoff until sustainer cutoff. Following booster staging, two vernier engines\nprovide roll control. After sustainer cutoff the vernier engines\nprovide fine trajectory corrections. During the boost phase of\nfirst stage flight the sustainer--vernier system is inoperative as\nfar as chamber gimbaling is concerned. However, at staging, the\n\nsystem assu.t,^ s attitude control of the vehicle.\n\nSpacecraft\n\nAdapter\n\nThe spacecraft is attached to the launch vehicle by a 129-cm\n(50.8-in.) conical adapter mounted to the first stage.\n\nf\t\n\nGuidance and Control\n\nk\t\n\n,\n\n^\t\n\nThe launch vehicle trajectory is a direct ascent ballistictype one with a 192.8-degree launch azimuth from the launch complex. The launch vehicle provides a state vector at satellite\nseparation to attain an apogee altitude of about 870 km (540 mi.).\nGuidance and control of the launch vehicle are accomplished by the\nAtlas autopilot which is preprogrammed.
