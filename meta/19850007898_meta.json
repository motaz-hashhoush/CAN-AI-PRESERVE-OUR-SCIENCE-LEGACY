The principle of the gauge is to measure the expansion or contraction of the fine structures of surface by detecting the resultant speckle displacement in an optoelectronic way, whereby the effect of rigid-body motion is automatically cancelled out with the aid of a differential detection system. A transportable apparatus was built and a comparison experiment performed with a resistance strain gauge at room temperature. It has a strain sensitivity of .00002, a gauge length smaller than 1 mm, and no upper limit in a range of strain measurement. In the measurement of high-temperature strain it is free from the need for a dummy gauge and insensitive to an electric drift effect. As examples of strain measurement at high-temperature, thermal expansion and contraction of a top of a soldering iron are measured. The interval of the measurement can be made at shortest 1.6 sec. and the change in the strain is clearly followed until the ultimate stationary temperature is reached.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850007898, "id": "b7359c4879ad41b7a7bf40c2f076d3a1", "publicationDate": "1984-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19850007898.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19850007898/downloads/19850007898.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19850007898/downloads/19850007898.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19850007898/downloads/19850007898.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
