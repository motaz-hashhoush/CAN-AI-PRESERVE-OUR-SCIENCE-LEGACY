BACKGROUND\nThe multipurpose logistics module (MPLM) is a pressurized module used for transporting\ninternational standard payload racks (ISPR), consumable supplies, and various other logistical items\nto and from the International Space Station (ISS) (fig. 1). The 21-ft-long by 15-ft-diameter aluminum\ncanister can transport up to 20,000 lb of payload in a pressure and temperature controlled environment.\nThe environment inside the MPLM is maintained by pressure relief valves (both positive and negative),\nexternal multilayer insulation (MLI) blankets, and a shell heater system located on the structural skin.\nThe internal temperature and pressure of the module are controlled via the heaters to ensure the\nfollowing: (1) prevention of condensation inside the MPLM (60 \xc2\xb0F maximum dewpoint, (2) prevention\nof actuation of either the positive pressure relief assembly (PPRA) or the negative pressure relief\nvalve\xc2\xa0(NPRV), (3) maintenance of the MPLM internal cabin air temperature between 50 to 113 \xc2\xb0F,\nand (4) maintenance of the MPLM cabin air pressure in the range of 13.9 to 15.2 psia.\nFrom an operational perspective, an MPLM mission has three distinct phases. Phase 1 occurs\nfrom launch through hatch opening on the ISS. Phase 2 occurs while the hatch is open to the ISS,\nand phase 3 is the time period between hatch closure on ISS through landing. Phase 3 is typically the\nonly period when the 28 V heaters are operated. During this portion of the mission, the MPLM cabin\nair environment must be maintained between the positive and negative pressure relief valve actuation\npressures (PPRA and NPRVs) and above the local dewpoint temperature.\n\nFigure 1. Illustration of MPLM stowed in the Space Shuttle payload bay.\n\n\x18\n\nThe initial MPLM shell heater system design utilized 3200 Series Elmwood thermostats\nto provide temperature control. Unfortunately, the thermostat set points were so high (81 to 95 \xc2\xb0F set\npoint range) that the MPLM PPRAs would actuate during a nominal mission timeline. The risk of\nactuating PPRAs during on-orbit operations could jeopardize MPLM mission objectives if a valve\nfailure were to occur. This scenario would result in the loss of valuable make-up consumables from\neither the ISS or Space Shuttle. Furthermore, the higher set points required additional Shuttle cryogenic\nresources to operate the fuel cell power supply used to drive the MPLM shell heaters.\nTo compensate for the high set points, the MPLM shell heaters were operated manually. Heater\nswitches, located in the Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s aft flight deck, were cycled on/off by the flight crew. Preflight thermal\nanalyses were used to define approximate heater duty cycles, while real-time telemetry was used\nto \xe2\x80\x9cfine-tune\xe2\x80\x9d the heater on/off times to meet mission objectives. This effort required real-time Mission\nOperations Directorate (MOD) support to coordinate crew activities in order to perform these tasks.\nAnother drawback of manual heater operations lies in the fact that the MPLM shell heaters could only\nbe operated while the crew was awake. Extended heater cycles during crew sleep periods could raise\nthe internal MPLM air pressures above the PPRV pressure limits. These constraints proved to be both\ncumbersome and inefficient for real-time flight operations.\nIn October 2000 the MPLM Project Office presented a proposal to the ISS Program Office\nfor developing solid state programmable thermostats that would replace the bimetallic disk-style\ndevices. These solid state thermostats offered several advantages including tighter temperature control,\nselectable set points, and closed-loop feedback control capability. These features, in turn, would result\nin greater operational flexibility during future ISS missions.\nThis Technical Memorandum (TM) discusses the programmable thermostat module (PTM)\nproject development cycle and first time use of these state-of-the-art thermostats.\n\n\x18\n\n2. MULTIPURPOSE LOGISTICS MODULE PROGRAMMABLE\nTHERMOSTAT SYSTEM\nThe MPLM has two sets of heaters and thermostats, one operating on 28 V power and one\noperating on 120 V power. The 28 V string is powered from the Space Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s fuel cell power supply\nand is used while the MPLM is in the Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s payload bay. The 120 V string is powered by the ISS and\nis used when the MPLM is attached to the ISS. The 28 V heater system consists of 22 thermostatically\ncontrolled heater circuits and 66 individual Kapton\xef\x9b\x9b (a DuPont product) resistive element heater pads.\nOnly the 28 V thermostats were replaced with the new PTMs.\nFigure 2 illustrates the new PTM and its coupled sensor, an external resistive temperature\ndevice\xc2\xa0(RTD). The PTM module design consists of a secured printed wiring board assembly mounted\nin an aluminum housing. The aluminum housing is affixed to a mounting bracket with four setscrews.\nThe carrier bracket, in turn, is secured to the MPLM pressure shell with a high strength epoxy adhesive.\nThis installation design allows for easy replacement of failed units. Real-time temperature monitoring\nis accomplished with the RTDs.\n\n28 V Removed Wiring\nFuse\n\nExisting\nThermostat\n\n28 V RTN\n\nRTD Sensor\n\nModule-To-Carrier\nMounting Screws\nProgrammable\nThermostat\nModule\n\nShell\n\nExisting\nShell\nHeaters\n\nThermal Pad\n\nCarrier\nCommunications\nConnector\n\nEpoxy\n\nFigure 2. Programmable thermostat hardware.\n\n\x18\n\nIn the upgraded 28 V heater network, 20 PTM/RTD assemblies and a data recorder module\n(DRM) replaced the bimetallic disk-type thermostats. The DRM records various PTM flight parameters\n(temperature, on/off status, and other associated health monitoring parameters). Two circuits were left\nunchanged in the new configuration as a result of design constraints.\nEach PTM/DRM module contains two interfaces. One is an electrical interface, while the other\nis the communications link for command and data handling (C&DH). The electrical interfaces consist\nof the 28 V power supply/return and RTD wiring, while the C&DH interface is achieved through a\nRS-485 communications cable and 21-pin micro \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d metal shell connectors. The DRM interfaces are\nidentical to the PTMs with the exception of the RTD pigtail leads.\nThe PTM electrical installation was accomplished by clipping the leads at the bimetallic terminal\ninterfaces and splicing into the main 28 V harness power supply/return lines. The RTDs were mounted\nno more than 36 in (and no closer than 6 in) from the PTMs near the existing bimetallic thermostats.\nMounting distances were optimized through thermal analysis utilizing the systems improved numerical\ndifferencing analyzer (SINDA). The maximum distance is driven by the controllability of the heater\nzones while the minimum distance is chosen to avoid thermal contamination of the sensor by the\ncontroller.\nKey design features of the PTM system include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\t\n\nSize: 2.25 in \xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x891.75 in \xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x890.5 in\nWeight: < 75 g (w/o carrier); < 100 g (w/carrier)\nC&DH: RS-485 serial communication protocol\nSoftware: graphical users interface (GUI) developed for programming and monitoring\nInput Power: +9 to +28 Vdc\nExternal RTD temperature sensor\nExternal heater: up to 5 A at +28 Vdc\nProgrammable temperature set points and span.

A ground support\nequipment (GSE) computer is used to upload PTM control parameters (set points, error span, and data\nacquisition rates) during pre-mission ground processing operations at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).\nPost-mission data retrieval is also performed with the GSE computer.

HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT\nThe MPLM project office at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was responsible\nfor managing all of the design, development, testing, and verification (DDT&V) activities of the PTM\nproject. DDT&V activities, including environmental flight qualification and acceptance testing, were\nperformed using the available infrastructure and engineering support personnel at MSFC.1 The PTM\ncircuit boards were outsourced to a local electronics vendor for manufacturing. However, the final\nelectronics box-level assembly operations, including potting and wire staking, were completed at MSFC.\nThe Boeing/Huntsville division was responsible for providing the RS-485 communication\ncable design drawings, while the Boeing/KSC division completed the manufacture, test certification,\nand installation of the flight cable. MSFC relied upon the Advanced Logistics Technology Engineering\nCenter (ALTEC) (the Italian Space Agency MPLM-sustaining engineering partner) to provide detailed\ninstallation drawings of the PTM mounting design and RS-485 cable routing layout to KSC.\n3.1 Radiation Susceptibility Tests\nA key decision made early in the project design phase involved using industrial grade electronic,\nelectrical, and electromagnetic (EEE) parts in the circuit board design in lieu of more expensive\nradiation hardened parts. The technical risk was judged to be acceptable, as the on-orbit thermal\nenvironment is consistent with industrial grade parts qualifications. Furthermore, the PTMs are located\nin a benign radiation environment underneath external MLI blankets and micrometeoroid shielding.\nTo demonstrate the functional capability of these parts in a space environment, a series of\nradiation tests was performed on prototype units. Two thermostats and a data recorder were subjected\nto \xe2\x80\x9cproton\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cheavy ion\xe2\x80\x9d testing at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility for single event\neffects\xc2\xa0(SEE). These units were subjected to an equivalent amount of radiation that would be expected\nin 10 years of continuous operation on the ISS.\nThe test results demonstrated that the data recorder and thermostat units exceeded the onorbit mean time between failure (MTBF) design requirement of 365 days (equivalent to the MPLM\n25 mission life design requirement) without error or incident.2 The MTBF design limit for the DRMs\nwas determined to be 447.5 days. The PTMs exhibited no effects from the radiation testing. The DRM\nMTBF limit was due to data memory effects. However, the DRM design contains redundant memory\nbanks to compensate for this. The ISS EEE Parts Board approved a design waiver upon the successful\ncompletion of these radiation tests.\n3.2 Bond Strength Tests\nTwo bonding tests were performed to assess the bonding material and installation procedure\nof the PTM/DRM carrier brackets to the MPLM pressure shell. The installation procedure was based\n\n\x18\n\non a microtransaxial accelerometer unit (TAU) strain gauge bonding process developed at KSC.\nRTV-566 epoxy adhesive was the bonding agent used for the PTM carrier bracket mounting design.\nA single PTM was mounted on a Space Shuttle solid rocket booster (SRB) test fixture to perform\nvibration development testing of the PTM carrier bracket mounting concept.3 The SRB test fixture was\nchosen for the development testing because its radius of curvature is approximately equal to that of the\nMPLM structural shell.\nPrior to performing the bond/vibration tests, a static load test was performed (in shear plane)\non the bonded PTM. The PTM remained affixed to the SRB test fixture and successfully met the 70-lbf\nstrength requirement called out in the MicroTAU procedure.\nA second bond test was performed to determine the ultimate tensile strength of the RTV-566\nadhesive bond. The \xe2\x80\x9cpull to failure\xe2\x80\x9d ultimate strength of the RTV-566 adhesive was measured to be\n1,116 lbf in the shear plane.\nThe results obtained from these development tests validated the PTM RTV-566 mounting\ninstallation concept.\n\n\x18\n\n4. HARDWARE QUALIFICATION AND ACCEPTANCE\nAll PTM qualification and acceptance testing was performed at MSFC\xe2\x80\x99s environmental test\nfacilities. This included electrical emissions induced/conductance (EMI/EMC), random vibration/\nstructural, and thermal cycle flight testing. Figure 4 shows the test fixture that was developed for the\nPTM flight qualification/acceptance testing.4\n\nFigure 4. MPLM PTM environmental test fixture.\nFlight certification testing utilized a lot qualification/acceptance test approach. A special test\nfixture was designed to accommodate 25 PTM/DRM units during a single test flow sequence. All\ntesting was performed in accordance with the standards and guidelines established by the ISS program\nin SSP 41172, \xe2\x80\x9cQualification and Acceptance Environmental Test Requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d5 EMI/EMC test\nstandards are defined in NSTS-21000-IDD-ISS, \xe2\x80\x9cInternational Space Station Interface Definition Design\nDocuments.\xe2\x80\x9d6\nEach PTM and DRM was acceptance tested to ensure workmanship only at the electronic box\nassembly level; no component testing was performed at the circuit board assembly level. Instead, quality\n\x18\n\nsurveillance was maintained at the vendor\xe2\x80\x99s facility through visual workmanship and inspection audits\nat all levels during the printed circuit board manufacturing process. These audits were performed prior\nto component testing of the potted electronic module assemblies. A total of 100 PTM assemblies and\n6\xc2\xa0DRM units were manufactured in this development effort.\nFigures 5 and 6 are flowcharts representing the environmental test flow paths performed during\nthis hardware development campaign. Ten PTMs and a single DRM were tested during the flight\nqualification phase, while four separate hardware acceptance test flows were completed on the remaining\nPTM/DRM units. The first three acceptance test lots consisted of 23 PTMs and 1 DRM, while the final\nacceptance flow consisted of 24 PTM and 2 DRMs.\n\nBurn-in\n\nInitial\nFunctional\n\nEMI/EMC\n2.2\n\nIntermediate\nFunctional\n\nFinal\nFunctional\n2.6\n\nThermal\nVacuum\n2.4\n\nIntermediate\nFunctional\n\nRandom\nVibration\n2.3\n\nFigure 5.

STS-121 MULTIPURPOSE LOGISTICS MODULE SHELL HEATER OPERATIONS\nThe STS-121/ULF1.1 ISS mission was launched on July 4, 2006. This was the first flight of the\nfully automated MPLM 28 V shell heater system. During the six previous MPLM missions, the shell\nheaters were manually cycled to maintain temperature/pressure (T/P) control within power requirements\ndefined in the ISS mission integration plan (MIP). Beginning with this mission, however, the automated\nPTM system posed new challenges for conducting the MPLM heater operations due to the fact that\nthe PTMs cannot be reprogrammed from the ground during flight operations.\nIn order to meet operational requirements with the PTM heater system, a new flight rule had to\nbe developed for the STS-121 mission. This rule defined the range of acceptable cabin air T/P conditions\nprior to the MPLM hatch closure. The desired ISS cabin air properties are functions of the final MPLM\ncabin air temperature and the NPRV/PPRA crack pressures.\nThe ISS closeout conditions were derived in the following manner:\n\t\nwhere:\n\n\xef\xa3\xabT \xef\xa3\xb6\nT1 = P \xef\xa3\xac 2 \xef\xa3\xb7 \t\n1\n\xef\xa3\xad P2 \xef\xa3\xb8\n\n(1)\n\nT1 = ISS closeout air temperature\nT2 = MPLM final air temperature\nP1 = ISS closeout air pressure\nP2 = NPRV/PPRV minimum crack pressure\n\nT1 values represent ISS closeout air temperatures that are calculated over a range of P1 closeout\npressure conditions. T2 is the MPLM cabin air temperature at deorbit and is represented by the steadystate MPLM shell temperature (PTM heater set point). P2 pressures are the minimum as-tested crack\npressures of the NPRV and PPRA valves flown during this mission.\nAdjusting T2 values upward or downward by the temperature control span simulated the PTM\ntemperature control errors. A temperature control span of 0.4 \xc2\xb0F was selected for this mission to ensure\nthat a tight control range about the desired set point would be maintained at all times. For the NPRV\nlimit line calculations, T2 values were adjusted downward. For the PPRA limits, these values were\nadjusted upward.\nT1 temperatures were plotted against P1 closeout pressures. The resultant T/P curves define the\nNPRV and PPRA crack pressure limits at MPLM hatch closure. Any ISS cabin air T/P combination that\nlies between these limit lines and above the ISS local dewpoint will satisfy pressure and condensation\nrequirements for the MPLM hardware.\n\n13\n\nISS closeout conditions for six discreet PTM set point cases were analyzed for this mission.\nThe optimum mission set point was selected from the corresponding closeout chart which completely\nbounded ISS cabin air T/P conditions between the NPRV/PPRA crack pressure envelope.\nFigure 7 is the MPLM/ISS closeout flight rule that was developed for the STS-121 mission.\nThis flight rule is based on a 78 \xc2\xb0F PTM heater set point. The corresponding heater control range is 77.6\nto 78.4 \xc2\xb0F (25.2 to 25.6 \xc2\xb0C).\n\nT1, MPLM Closeout Temperature (\xc2\xb0F)\n\n90\n\n85\nNPRV Crack Limit\n80\n\nDesired Closeout Region\n\n75\nISS Nominal [T,P] Range\n72\xe2\x80\x9374 \xc2\xb0F @ 14.65\xe2\x80\x9314.75 psi\n\nPPRA Crack Limit\n\n70\nAcceptable Closeout\n65\n\n60\n14.5\n\nMPLM Maximum Dewpoint Limit\n\n14.55\n\n14.6\n\n14.65\n\n14.7\n\n14.75\n\n14.8\n\n14.85\n\n14.9\n\n14.95\n\nP1, MPLM Closeout Pressure (psia)\n\nFigure 7. STS-121 MPLM/ISS closeout conditions (78 \xc2\xb0F set point, \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xc2\xb0F control band).\nFinally, a thermal analysis was performed to determine whether the PTM mission set point\nwould meet the STS-121 MIP power budget requirements.9 The MPLM heater power assessment was\ncompleted by ALTEC using the SINDA thermal analysis software program. The SINDA model assumed\nnominal Shuttle bay-to-Earth orbital heating rates and an ISS closeout air temperature of 72 \xc2\xb0F for the\ninitial conditions in the analysis.\nThe ALTEC analysis predicted 28 kWh of heater power used during nominal time lined end\nof mission (EOM) heater operations with an additional 8 kWh used during mission extension days.\nThe STS-121 MIP allocated 30.5 kWh of heater power for nominal operations (at 278 h mission elapsed\ntime\xc2\xa0(MET)) and 16 kWh power for the additional contingency orbit days. The ALTEC model results\nmet the STS-121 MIP requirements and were presented to Johnson Space Center (JSC) STS-121\nJoint Operations Panel (JOP) for formal flight approval.10 Figures 8 and 9 are the heater power levels\npredicted by the ALTEC SINDA model.\n\n14\n\n16,000\n14,000\n12,000\n\nEnergy (Wh)\n\n10,000\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n0\n\xe2\x80\x932,000\n210\n\n215\n\n220\n\n225\n\n230\n\n235\n\nTime (h)\n\nFigure 8.

STS-121 PROGRAMMABLE THERMAL MODULE DATA ANALYSIS\nThe STS-121 flight was the first time that MPLM shell temperatures were recorded during\nISS flight operations. The data obtained from the DRM indicated that the PTM system performed\nexceptionally well. The MPLM shell heaters operated for 61 hours, beginning shortly after the MPLM\nwas returned to the Shuttle payload bay and ending \xe2\x89\x881 h prior to deorbit operations.\nPost-mission data analysis indicated that all 20 PTMs functioned as designed and maintained\nthe MPLM shell temperatures within the expected temperature control band. The flight day 12 (FD12)\ntelemetry data obtained during the MPLM environment check indicated that some of the individual\nheater circuits had begun to cycle off. This was verified by current readings recorded on the heater\ncircuit screen displays.\nFigures 10 and 11 are plots of the shell heater energy and power profiles, respectively. Figure 10\nshows the total heater energy calculated from the recorded heater on/off duty cycles. A total of 23 kWh\nof energy was used during the STS-121 mission, slightly less than ALTEC\xe2\x80\x99s predicted model value.\nEnergy (kWh)\n\n25\n\nTotal Energy (kWh)\n\n20\n\n15\nOrbiter\nAttitude Timeline:\n\n10\n\nAPU Port\nSidewall\nAttiude\n\nAPU Port\nSidewall\nAttiude\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n36\n\n40\n\n44\n\n48\n\n52\n\n56\n\n60\n\nMET from PTM Powerup (h)\n\nFigure 10.

MPLM heater power profile.\nFigure 11 shows the heater power profile. The shell heaters were running at 100 percent duty\ncycle during the first six hours of heater operations.\nThe lower than expected energy usage is attributed to off-nominal flight attitudes flown during\nthe last two mission days, as the Shuttle was oriented a in portside, sun-facing trajectory (\xe2\x80\x93Y direction)\nduring portions of FDs 12 and 13. These unplanned flight trajectories were driven by problems\nassociated with the Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s auxiliary power unit (APU) fuel system. Figure 12 is an isometric view\nof the MPLM external configuration, while figure 13 references the coordinate system of the MPLM\nin the Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s payload bay. The Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93Y axis points to the portside of the MPLM. This direction\npoints outward from the flexible releasable grapple fixture (FRGF) located below the support bracket for\nthe fluid payload disconnect assembly (PDA) shown in figure 12. The Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93X axis points outward\nfrom the forward end cone.\n\n18\n\nSupport Bracket\nfor Electrical PDA\nStablizer Trunnion\n\nCBM Ring\n\nFRGF\n\nMOPS Panel\n\nMain Trunnion\nSupport Bracket\nfor Fluid PDA\nStablizer Trunnion\nFRGF\nMain Trunnion\n\nFigure 12.

These influences are especially dramatic in figures 14\nand 15. Figure 14 shows the MPLM grapple fixture temperatures (FRGFs in fig.12). These fixtures\nare almost 180\xc2\xb0 apart, with the grapple (GRAP) \xe2\x80\x93Y PTM facing the sun. This PTM circuit remains\noff during the port maneuvers, while the GRAP +Y PTM cycles continuously, because this location\nis shaded. These effects are also illustrated in the aft cylinder and common berthing mechanism (CBM)\ntemperature profiles as well (figs. 14 and 15).\n\nPTM4A\n\n30\n\nPTM5A\n\nPTM6A\n\n28\n26\n\nTemperature (\xc2\xb0C)\n\n24\n22\n20\n18\n\nOrbiter\nAttitude Timeline:\n\n16\n\nAPU Port\nSidewall\nAttiude\n\nAPU Port\nSidewall\nAttiude\n\n14\n12\n10\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n36\n\n40\n\n44\n\n48\n\n52\n\nMET from PTM Powerup (h)\n\nFigure 14.
