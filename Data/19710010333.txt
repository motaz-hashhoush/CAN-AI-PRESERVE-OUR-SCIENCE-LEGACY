The instrument\n\nconsists of a primary coil and several secondary coils. Alternating\n\ncurrent through the primary coil produces an oscillating magnetic field\n\nin the shape of a dipole. Positions of the secondary coils relative to\n\nthe primary are such that they\'respond to distortions of the applied\n\nmagnetic field of the primary that are brought about by the presence and\n\nmotion of an electrically conducting fluid. These signals on the\n\nsecbndaries vary linearly with the conductivity and with the product of\n\nconductivity times velocity. Various possible coil arrangements and\n\ntests conducted with a simple three-coil configuration in an electric arc\n\njet are presented. Details of the probe tested, its calibration, and its\n\ntheoretical basis are described. Results obtained with the three-coil\n\nsystem are in hood agreement with theory.\n\n\n*Assistant Chief, Theoretical Branch\n\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nAmes Research Center\n\nMoffett Field, Calif.\n\n\nAbstract to be presented at\n\nFifth NASA Intercenter and Contractor\n\nConference on Plasma Physics\n\nto be held at Washington, D.

For this\nillustrated entry, the maximum radiative heat transfer occurs\nalmost simultaneously with -maximum convective heat transfer.\nThus, spectroscopic -examination of the Mars atmosphere by viewing\nthe gas-cap radiation from within the probe may be hindered by\nthe radiation from ablation vapors. A study of the effect of\n\nradiation from ablation vapors upon the detection of gas-cap\n\nradiation in a plasma tunnel forms the subject matter of the\npresent paper.\n\nExperimental Arrangement\nThe experimental arrangement is shown in figure 2. The\nsource optics within the flat-faced test body directs radiation\nfrom the gas cap out the rear flange of the body via a first\xc2\xad\nsurface mirror. After passing through the wind tunnel port, the\nradiation is reflected to a cylindrical first-surface mirror .\nwhere the circular beam is focused as a line on the entrance slit\nof a spectrograph. The spectrograph had a focal ratio of 6.8 and\n\n*Research Scientist\n\n\nwas equipped with a 1200 groove/mm grating blazed at 3500k.\' The\n\ngas-cap spectra in the range 2700 to 6500A were recorded by means\n\nThe .plates were calibrated with the body in place\nof photographs.\nby directing a collimated beam from a tungsten-ribbon filament\nlamp into the source optics. The radiative intensity of the\ntungsten filament was determined by measuring brightness tempera\xc2\xad\nture with an optical pyrometer and by recourse- to the emissivity\ndata of Larrabee to obtain the spectral energy distribution.\nThe film was Kodak Spectrographic plate film type 103 F.\nExposure times for both tests and calibrations were such that the\n\nreciprocity law, i.e., I X T = const., pertains for the photo\xc2\xad\ngraphic emulsion. Photographic densities were read with a Joyce\nLoebel microdensitometer.\n\n\nResults and Discussion\n\n\nGas-cap radiation was measured for non-ablating and ablating\xc2\xad\nsurfaces. Experimental results for a non-ablating copper surface\n\nare shown in figure 3. Total radiation per unit volume is plotted\n\nagainst velocity. The effect of density is accounted for by using\n\nthe correlating parameter suggested by theoretical \'alculations.\n\nThe gas mixture consisted of 46 percent C02, 23 percent N2 , and\n\n31 percent Argon (percents by volume). The present results are\n\ncompared with the molecular theory prediction for C02 -N mixtures\n2\nof Arnold, Reis and Woodward, reference 1. The theory has been\nadjusted to correspond to the same percentages (by volume) as the\ntest gas (i.e.j 46 percent C02, 23 percent N 2, 31 percent A)..\nThis adjustment was made by applying (1) the experimental correla\xc2\xad\ntion obtained by James (ref. 2) for concentration effects and (2)\nthe theoretical dilution correlation for Argon (ref. 2). The\nballistic range and shock-tube data of references 1, 2 and 3 with\nno argon dilution are also shown. The theory of reference 2 agrees\'\nvell with these results. The present data also show the predicted\ntrend with velocity and agree with the dilution effect of argon\n\npredicted by the theory of reference 2. The adjusted theoretical\ncurve which applies to the present gas mixture differs by factors\nof 2.5 at 5 ki/sec to 1.2 at 7 km/sec.\nIn contrast to the non-ablating surface considered up until\n\nnow, when- an ablative surface is exposed to a hot plasma stream,\nthe region close to the body contains a high concentration of\n\nThis is illus\xc2\xad\nablation vapors at a relatively cool temperature.\ntrated in figure 4. This figure shows a polyethylene surface\nablating in a stream at an equivalent vflocity of 5.5 km/sec and\na density ratio of 10 - . \n The heating rate is about 100 watts/cm.\nThe stagnation zone is divided into two distinct regions: (1)\n\nthe high temperature stagnation zone and (2) the low temperature\n\nablation vapor zone. Even at very low densities, the two zones\n\nremain quite distinct.\n\nThe effect of the radiation from the ablation vapor zone on\nthe observed gas-cap spectra is shownin figure 5. This slide\npresents spectra of the gas cap for the non-ablating copper nose\nand for several plastic ablative materials. The gas mixture\nconsisted of 7 percent C02, 91 percent N2 , and 2 percent A (by\nvolume). The tests were made at an equivalent velocity of 8 km/sec.\nThe wavelength range of the spectrograms is from 3500 to 6700A.\nFor the non-ablating copper surface the radiative flux is due\nalmost solely to the CN violet band system (which is the same\nresult found above for the other non-ablating case with more C0\npresent). The three lower spectra are for exactly the same flow\nconditions but with surfaces of polyethylene, (CH4). polytetra\xc2\xad\nfluoroethylene, (02F4)x, and polyformaldehyde, (CH20)x. The gas\xc2\xad\ncap spectra are quite similar in structure for each of the three\nplastics.\nIn addition to enhanced CN violet radiation, the ablation\xc2\xad\nvapor radiation consists of C2 Swan band radiation and the C High-\n\nPressure band system. The hydrocarbon plastics also display a\n\nprominent CH 4300A band series and appreciable hydrogen line\n\nradiation. A trace amount of hydrogen appears in the stream for\n\nthe copper surface.\n\nBecause the CN violet band system appears to be well under\xc2\xad\nstood and amenable to analysis,both in terms of species concentra\xc2\xad\ntion and velocity derived from trajectory data, it represents a\n\nprime candidate for monitoring radiation during entry into an\n\natmosphere with C02 and N2 constituents. However, the plasma\n\ntunnel tests indicate sizable enhancement of the CN violet system\n\nby the presence of ablation ejecta in the boundary layer. The\n\nenhancement of the CN violet system by the ablators is shown in\n\nfigure 6. Radiation only from the CN violet system is listed\n\nrelative to the non-ablating copper surface. All of the plastic\n\nablators increased the ON violet band system radiation by approxi\xc2\xad\nmately the same amount (values range from 2 to 4). These data\n\nare apparently contrary to ballistic range and shock tube data\n\nwhich show little or no increase in total radiation with poly\xc2\xad\ntetrafluoroethylene and polyformaldehyde models. In the following\n\ndiscussion ablation measurements from an air study are used to\n\nshow that there is in fact no inconsistency and that one can\n\nestimate the ablation vapor radiation relative to the gas-cap\n\nradiation using suitable scaling laws.\n\nFor an ablating surface, the scaling law for radiation is\n\nshown in figure 7. Integrated total radiative intensity over\n\n\nthe wavelength range 3600 to 6700A is shown as a function of body\nradius for a polyethylene surface exposed to constant flow condi\xc2\xad\ntions in a plasma tunnel. The data are shown normalized to the\n\nintensity for the smallest body. These tests were performed in\n\nair using polyethylene models of the same blunt shape but with\nradii smaller than the 5 cm value of the test body described\nabove. The effects of testing in air rather than in C02 -N2 -A\nmixtures is considered to be unimportant since only relative\nchanges in the ablation vapor zone radiation were considered.\nMoreover, the measurements indicate (fig. 6) that the gas-cap\nradiation represents a relatively small part of the total radia\xc2\xad\ntion. Therefore, the scaling law for ablation vapor radiation\nwill depend only weakly on the main flow constituents. Since\nthe flow conditions were constant for the test series, the decrease\nin radius for this test series is equivalent to an increase in\nthe convective heating rate. The reason for this is that the\nvelocity gradient -mustincrease for the smaller radii with a\nresultant increase in the laminar heat transfer rate to the\nsurface. Intuitively, then, as the body radius decreases, the\nincreased shear at the surface will cause the ablation vapor zone\n\nto become thinner; and the radiation intensity would decrease.\n\nBased on these general considerations, a scaling law for radiation\n\nfrom the ablation vapor zone has been derived by Wino- ich and\nCroce (ref. 4), which yields the result that the intensity varies\n\nas the square root of the body radius for laminar flow. -The solid\n\nline shown on figure 7 represents the predicted slope, and the\n\nexperimental results agree well with this prediction.\n\nUsing the scaling law for ablation vapor radiation, (fig. 7),\nand the scaling law for the gas-cap radiation (fig. 3), and the\nmeasured enhancement of radiation found for polyethylene (fig. 6),\nthe relative intensities of gas-cap radiation as compared to the\ntotal radiation can be predicted for various situations. The\nscaling laws have been applied to typical ballistic range measure\xc2\xad\nments and to the contemplated Mars entry. These results are\nshown in figure 8. All comparisons are made for a velocity of 5.6\nkm/sec corresponding to the velocity at the peak heating condition.\nThe test body shape and density range are selected as typical for\neach case. For the plasma tunnel tests with an ablating surface,\n\nthe gas-cap radiation is only 25 percent of the total emitted\n\nradiation. On the other hand, the prediction for the ballistic\n\nrange case is that over 90 percent of the total radiation emanates\n\nfrom the gas cap. Plastic models, therefore, can be used in\nballistic ranges with negligible uncertainty regarding the radiation\nsource. Finally, for the Mars entry case at the time of peak\nheating, the gas cap contributes 80 percent of the observed radia\xc2\xad\ntion. However, at an earlier time during the entry (4 seconds\nprior) the gas-cap radiation represents only 29 percent of the\n\ntotal radiation. The use of an ablative heat shield would result\n\n\nin a measurement -that contains a variable contribution from the\nablation vapor zone radiation. This would introduce uncertainties\n\ninto the interpretation of the gas-cap radiation during a critical\n\nperiod \t hen spectral measurements are recorded., For this reason,\n\nw\natmospheric probes instrunented for spectral measurements should\n\nprobably incorporate heat-sink-type thermal protection to avoid\n\n,contamination of the shock layer with ablation vapors.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nArnold, J. 0., Reis, V.

Watson*\n\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nAmes Research Center\n\nMoffett Field, Calif.\n\n\nThe first constricted-arc plasma generators that were con\xc2\xad\nstructed at Ames were operated at sufficiently low Reynolds\nNumbers that arc-column theories based on laminar flow yielded\nfair predictions of their performance (refs. 1 - 4). However,\nthese theories do not predict properly the performance of the\nlarger plasma generators at larger flow rates. For example, the\nexperimental performance of a 1-inch diameter constricted-arc\nplasma generator operated at a mass flow of 65 grams per second\nof nitrogen is not predicted accurately by numerical calculations\nfor a theoretical model that assumes laminar flow, as illustrated\nin figure 1. One possible cause of this discrepancy is the effect\nof turbulent mixing on energy transfer processes within the arc\ncolumn.\nTo illustrate qualitatively the effects that turbulence may\nhave, turbulent mixing was included in the theoretical model using\nPrandtl\'s Mixing Length Theory vherein momentum and energy transfer\nare proportional to the density and the velocity gradients. This\n\nturbulent mixing throughout the arc column appreciably changes the\ncalculated enthalpy and mass flow distributions with length and\n\nradius, as shown in figure 2.\nThe calculated variation of average\nenthalpy with length is compared vith experiment in figure 3.\n\n*Research Scientist\n\n\n16\nThe addition of turbulent mixing to the theoretical analysis\nproduces good, though perhaps fortuitous, agreement with the\n\ndata.\n\nThe additional energy transfer due to turbulence shortens\n\nthe characteristic constrictor length required for the enthalpy,\nto approach an asymptotic limit, and it also reduces the value\nof this asymptotic enthalpy for a given current and mass flow.\nThus the maximum enthalpy that could be contained in a constrictor\nhaving turbulent flow throughout the arc column should ble less\nthan wculd be possible were the flow entirely laminar.\nAn estimate of the reduction in the achievable enthalpy, and\n\nof other arc-column parameters, for the turbulent regime can be\nobtained from a one-dimensional analysis wherein the constrictor\nheating rate is assumed to vtry in proportion to the bulk enthalpy\nFor a given maximum heat transfer\nand the specific mass flux.\nrate to the constrictor wall, the solution for this one-dimensional\n\nmodel yields a maximum achievable enthalpy that is inversely\n\nproportional-to the specific mass flux. Because, in a constricted\xc2\xad\narc plasma generator the flow is aerodynamically choked, the\n\nconstrictor inlet pressure can also be related to the specific\n\nmass flux and enthalpy, and a plot can be made of the maximum\nenthalpy that can be contained as a function of pressure, as\nshown in figure 4. In figure 4, the location of the turbulent\ncontainment limit wad\' obtained by scaling from experilmental data,\nThe Reynolds\nand the laminar limit was obtained from reference 5.\nNumber per cm is also shown on the abscissa of this figure. This\n\nfigure illustrates that the limit formerly predicted from laminar\ntheory is reduced appreciably by turbulence.\n\nThe one-dimensional solution also yields a characteristic\n\nconstrictor length that is independent of flow rate and proportional\nonly to the constrictor diameter. In contrast, for the lamimr\n\nregime the constrictor length was proportional to the flow rate\n\nand independent of the diameter. The predicted characteristic\n\nlength as a function of flow rate and diameter for both regimes\nLs shown on figure 5.\nThese results suggest that if turbulent transfer processes\n\nDceur in the arc column, the test Reynolds Numbers can be in\xc2\xad\ncreased while maintaining a high enthalpy by using larger diameter\nconstrictors and by reducing the ratio of the nozzle exit diameter\n\nto the constrictor diameter.\n\n\n17\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nStine, H.

Knechtel*\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nAmes Research Center\n\nMoffett Field, Calif.\n\nBasically the Faraday cup is a very simple device for measur\xc2\xad\ning the directed energy for a single species of charged particle.\nEssentially it consists of a flat-plate charge collector enclosed\nin a cup. The beam of ions or electrons to be analyzed \'enters an\naperture at the open end of the cup where they are slowed dawn by\na retarding potential on the collector plate\' The energy distri\xc2\xad\nbution of the beam is obtained from a characteristic curve of\nthe collector plate current as a function of the plate retarding\npotential. Ideally, for a monoenergetic beam, this character\xc2\xad\nistic curve should be perfectly flat until the retarding poten\xc2\xad\ntial just equals the ion energy in electron volts, at which\npoint the plate current should abruptly fall to zero. Many\nfactors make it impossible to achieve a-beam with this ideal\nenergy distribution. \'In addition the Faraday cup itself may\nintroduce varying effects on the apparent energy distribution.\nThe present paper will discuss some of the problems encountered\nin using a Farday cup to determine energy distribution in a plasma\nbeam of accelerated\'argon ions.\nBriefly, the plasma device used in the present investigation\n\nconsists of a plasma source, an ion accelerating system, and a\n\nsource of electrons for neutralizing the space charge within the\n\n\n*Research Scientist\n\n\n25\n\n26\n\naccelerated ion beam. The ion beam-is about 1 inch in diameter\nand has a number density of the order of 10 ions per cubic\ncentimeter with directed energies variable between 10 c.d.25Q.ev.\nThe beam consists of argon ions that flow through a background\nof argon gas at 2 X 10 4 Torr pressure.\nA nonideal Faraday-cup characteristic along with the simple\n\ncup configuration used to obtain the curve is shown in figure 1.\n\nThis cup consists of the collector plate and a grid (see inset)\n\nat negative potential to reject the electrons. Both are enclosed\n\nin a nonconducting cylinder. Several deviations from the ideal\n\ncurve are evident. Near zero potential some lo.w energjions\n\nresulting from charge exchange appear. Above 150 volts the plate\n\ncurrent is negative as a result of collecting secondary electrons\n\nfrom the electron filtering grid. The initial slope and the\n\npremature rounding-off of the curve are due to various forms of\nbeam divergence., both real and induced by the above cup configura\xc2\xad\ntion. Since beam divergence has created the major difficulties,\n\nthe remainder of the paper will concentrate on this problem.\n\nThe difficulty associated with divergence results from the\n\nions approaching the Faraday cup with a component of velocity\n\ntransverse to the axis of the cup as well as parallel to the\n\naxis, This transverse velocity component is not altered by the\n\nretarding plate potential so that the ions will follow a curving\n\npath toward the walls of the cup. The result is a washed-out\n\nFaraday-cupcharacteristic curve with an indicated ion energy that\n\nis more nearly associated with the axial velocity component than\n\nthe total velocity.\n\nSeveral factors can cause divergende of the ion beam. These\n\n(a) original plasma beam divergence due to imperfections\n\ninclude:\nin the accelerating system and natural repulsion of the beam ions,\n\n(b,) scattering of ions by the neutral background gas, (c) inter\xc2\xad\nference of the piasma beam by the presence of the Faraday cup,\n\n(d) lens effect of the cup aperture, (e) nonuniform fields within\nthe cup. The first two of these factors are not really-attribut\xc2\xad\nable to the cup but must be considered in establishing the ultimate\nsharpness of the characteristic curve. The first difficulty\ninherent to the beam can be partially .compensated for by using a\nsmall cup aperture and aligning the cup axis with the local *\nvelocity4,vector. The second can be eliminated if the background\npressure can be reduced sufficiently. The cup interference problem\n\ncan be minimized by maintaining the shell of the cup at the plasma\n\npotential. The lens aperture will always cause some divergence\n\nof the beam as it enters the cup but the effect can be minimized\n\nby reducing the potential gradients on both sides of the aperture.\n\nThe problem of nonuniform fields within-the cup is itself due to\n\n\n27,\n\nto several factors: (a)wall effects; (t) fringing from element\n\nedges, (c) dirty surfaces, (d) poorly aligned elements. The wall\n\neffects can be a serious problem. As the ions are repelled by\n\nthe plate a certain portion of them will go to the wall. If the\n\nwall is a nonconductor, a charge will accumulate until no more\n\nions can pass through the resulting field to the wall. Entering\n\nions will see this field and be deflected from the axial direction\nor if the cup diameter is sufficiently small, the field can close\n\n,across the cup and prevent any ions from reaching the plate. A\n\nsolution to this problem is to make the cup diameter large compared\n\nto the \'aperture and internal beam diameter and to make the wall\n\narea small by placing the elements close together. This modifica\xc2\xad\ntion will also help the fringing problem by removing the element\n\nedges from the beam region. Dirty surfaces can be a problem\n\nbecause they can sustain potential gradients even on supposedly\n\nconducting surfaces.\nThe obvious solution is to maintain clean\nconditions and to-use materials in the cup that do not contaminate\neasily. Another possible remedy is to use small apertures instead\nof wire mesh for the grids. This, however, leads to problems of\noptical element alignment since each aperture behaves as an electro\xc2\xad\nstatic lens (see ref. I).\nOn the basis of the preceding considerations, an improved\n\nFaraday cup was built and tested. The cup to aperture radius\n\nratio was increased to 9, and the axial spacing of the elements\n\nwas reduced to 1/4 the cup diameter. The electron filtering grid\n\nwas made of very fine tungsten screen, 90-95 percent transparent\n\nto minimize secbndary electron formation. The collector plate was\n\nsurrounded by a guard ring which was maintained at the same poten\xc2\xad\ntial as the collector for the purpose of minimizing fringing\n\neffects at the collector. A characteristic curve for this modified\n\nFaraday cup is shown in figure 2. The energy spread indicated by\n\nthe modified cup\' is about 3.5 ev compared to between 20 and 25 ev\n\nfor the original cup under similar plasma conditions. There was\n\nno evidence of secondary electron current to the plate and the\n\nlow potential slope of the characteristic curve in the figure\n\nwas eliminated.\n\nReferences\n\nSimpson, J.

The methods used presently to determine\nenthalpy are.based on indirect measurements such as over-all heat\n\nand power balances on the system, heat-transfer rate and impact\n\npressure measurements combined with heat-transfer theories to\n\nprovide local enthalpy distributions, spectroscopic observations\n\nand related analytic assumptions, and combinations of these\n\nmethods. Because of the many uncertainties in these determina\xc2\xad\ntions, a flow-swallowing method for directly measuring enthalpy\nin constricted-arc plasma jets is under development.\nIn the constricted-arc facility shown in figure 1, tangen\xc2\xad\ntially injected gas is heated by passing,current through a con\xc2\xad\nstrictor to 23 anodes nearrthe exit. The supersonic stream is\nexpanded from a throat diameter 1.27 x 10 - 2 meters to an exit\n15.5 x 102 - meters through a 15 0 half-angle cone. The plasma\nis then discharged into a free-jet test chamber. The test\n\nchamber conditions are as follows: (1) a bulk stream enthalpy\n\nrange from 7 X 10 to 80 X 106 Joules/kilograms, based on a heat\n\nbalance for power input minus losses and gas flow rate, (2)\n\n\n*Research Scientist\n\n\n34\n\n2hay < h.\n\n<kha,\n\nbased on heating rate aid impact pressure\n\nprofiles, (3) impact pressure range of 8 x 1o- 3 to 5 \xc3\x97 10 \xc2\xad2\n\natms., (4) stagnation point heat-transfer rate up to 2 kw/cm2 .\n\nBecause of the uncertainties in the indirect measurements\n\nfor determination of enthalpy,. direct methods of sampling the\n\nplasma are under consideration. Although a number of \'blunt\n\n.body\' t or normal-shock-type flow-swall owing enthalpy probes are\navailable, such probes have a number of disadvantages that limit\n\ntheir usefulness in a low-density plasma stream. Some of these\n\ndisadvantages include:\n(1) a small captured mass which .leads to\n\ninaccuracies in mass-flow measurements, (2) uncertainties in\nlocation of the dividing stream tube on the probe nose \'with\n\nrespect.to the sampling orifice and in determining the associated\n\nquantity of heat to be attributed to the captured plasma, (3)\n\nrestrictions on the maximum heat-transfer rates that can be accommo\xc2\xad\ndated. To avoid these disadvantages, a probe is under study that\n\npromises to (a) capture two orders of magnitude or more mass than\n\ncomparable blunt probes, (b) allow for accurate definition of the\n\ncaptured stream tube, and (c) consequently permit accurate deter\xc2\xad\nmination of the heat content of the captured plasma.\n\nThe probe system differs from the available probes by utilizing\na sharp leading edge as shown in figure 2.\nTwo probes are to be\nprogrammed into the plasma in sequence. A water-cooled mas-flow\n\nmeasuring system, as shown in figure 2, will allow the captured\n\nplasma to be cooled to a reference temperature and the mass to be\n\ndetermined by using a venturi calibrated for low-density operation.\n\nThe second probe, of identical aerodynamic shape to the first, is\n\na transient heat-transfer calorimeter. The inner and, outer walls\n\nare separated by a gap that is maintained at static pressure to\n\nminimize heat conduction. The lip is sharp, and the angles are\n\ndesigned so that inner and outer compression surfaces have the\n\nsame heat-transfer rate. Thus a minimum of asymmetric thermal\n\nconduction occurs in the lip region. The leading edges and\n\ncontraction,region will be coated with a non-catalytic silicon\n\nmonoxide surface to reduce the heat transfer due to heterogeneous\n\nsurface reactions with the dissociated gas. Thus high local heat\xc2\xad\ntransfer rates near.the inlet will be suppressed until a downstream\n\nlocation is reached where the surfaces can be accurately instru\xc2\xad\nmented for heat-transfer rate measurements. The inside dimensions\n\nof the probe are designed to position the terminal shock downstream\nof the contraction, and the subsonic downstream pressure approxi\xc2\xad\nmates normal shock recovery for the free stream. The terminal\n\nshock can be located by adjusting the pumping pressure on the\n\ncaptured stream. By increasing this pressure in the subsonic\n\n\n35\nsection, the length for complete atomic recombinations to occur\n\nis minimized.\n\nThe first requirement of this design was the survival of a\nsharp leading edge in the plasma stream. A 150 half-angle water\xc2\xad\ncooled wedge (shown in figure 3) was placed at the centerline of\na plasma stream for 10 minutes duration. The leading edge of\nthis wedge withstood the plasma environment at a heat transfer\nrate of 1.2 X 10 7 watts/n 2 as measured at the stagnation point\nof a 2.5 X 10- 2 m diameter hemisphere.\n\nPreliminary tests of the flow-swallowing calorimeter probe\nhave determined that the stream is captured, that an oblique shock\noriginates at the lip, and that the sharp leading edge will also\nsurvive. In this test, the local pressures on the inside compres\xc2\xad\nsion surface, and in the minimum area section, and the impact\npressure of the stream were measured. The measured pressure ratio\nfor the two inside surfaces vith respect to impact pressure was\n0.42, -which indicates that the flow in the minimum section was\nsupersonic.\nHeat-transfer rates measured by the transient technique along\n\nthe subsonic cylindrical portion of the diffuser have determined\n\nthe length required to permit decay of all of the forms of energy\n\ninto thermal energy. The results of these preliminary tests are\n\nshown in figure 4. The two charts, (a) and (b), illustrate the\nvariation of heat-transfer rate vith length for two values of\nmass flw for a fixed total power input to the plasma stream.\nPart (a) of this figure shows that heat-transfer rate decreased\n\nmonotonically in argon. The nitrogen data, however, show a\n\ndefinite discontinuity at a position 0.3 meters from the upstream\n\nedge of the subsonic cylindrical section. The discontinuity\n\nindicates that atomic recombination is complete at this point,\n\nand that all the dissociated energy has been converted into\n\nthermal energy. It is interesting to note that the atomic recombina\xc2\xad\ntion rate\nN+ N+\n\nN2\np\n\n-C\n\n2N2 + KE\n\ncan be obtained from the position of this discontinuity in the\n\nheat-transfer curve. Even an approximate solution,\n\nC\n\n-\n\n4xp2 \'\n\nderived by Dr. Chul Park, gives a reasonable recombination rate for\nnitrogen. If a mass-averaged velocity defined as\n\n36\n\nmca4xp \'3 X10\ni0C\nx1015mole\'sec\nC = 0*3\nx~\nfor an estimated terminal shock temperature of 56000 K and an\nFigure 4b verifies that\nassumed uniform stream mass flow ().\nfor,the lower enthalpy and higher mass flow, the axial location of\nthe recombifation zone moves upstream as expected, because the\nlength x from the terminal shock is inversely proportional to the\ndensity cubed. The exit gas temperature was 380i for the low flow\nrate and 520 0K for the high flow rate. The exit temperatures were\nobtained on the axis by means of an unshielded thermocouple.\nIn conclusion, it appears feasible to operate an attached\xc2\xad\nshock flow-swallowing enthalpy probe, and therefore a more complete\n\ninstrument is being designed.\n\n\nFREE-JET TEST\nCONDITIONS\nNITROGEN ATM\n\nUPTRA\nCHAMBER\n\n6\n6\n7 x 10 < AV ENTHALPY < 80 x 10 J/km\n2hAv <h_<4h\n\n-\n\n-3\n8X 1O <Pt? <5 x O-2\nAotm\n\nCONIV--EN\n\nSTIO MULTO\nSECTION\n\nCHAMBER PRESSURE\n\nDOWNSTREAM\n\nELECTRODE\n\n\nI\n<P<2.5 atm\n\nNATIONAL\nAERONAUTICS SPACE\nAND\nADMINISRAIION\nAMES\nRESTARCH\nCENTER,\nMOFFETT\nFIELD,\nCALIFORNIA\n\n0.

Vorreiter\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nAmes Research Center\n\nMoffett Field, Calif.\nSince 1962 constricted are heaters for -wind tunnel applications\nhave been built-and tested at Ames Research Center. Very briefly,\nthe constricted-arc units are constructed of stacks of water-cooled\ncopper washers separated by boron nitride insulators and sealed by\n\n"0" rings. A cathode is located at the upstream end of the tube\n\nand a diverging nozzle at the other. A direct-current arc is\n\nestablished between the cathode and an anode array built into the\n\nnozzle -wall. The working fluid is introduced near or at the upstream\n\nend of the constrictor. Thirther construction details can be found\n\nin reference 1.\n\nTo study the effects of size on constrictor behavior, the six\nconstricted are heaters that have been constructed to date ranged\nin diameter from 0.64 cm to 2.54 cm, and in length fran 7.62 cm to\n137 cm. Numerous evolutionary modifications of constrictor design\n\ndetails, gas injection arrangements, and electrode assemblies were\n\nintroduced into each unit during the course of testing.. Two\n\ndevices having 1.27 cm diameter constrictors are presently opera\xc2\xad\ntional in the power range from 0.2 to 0.8 MW. The other device\n\ncurrently in use is a unit having a 2.54 cm diameter constrictor\n\nthat operates in the pwer range from 0.5 to 5.5 MW. It is the\nlargest such device that has been constructed to date, and its\nbehavior and performance will be the subject of the remainder of\nthis discussion. A schematic draving of this unit is shown in\nfigure 1.\n*Research Scientist\n\n\n42\n\nlength of 1.37\nAs is ,shown on figure 1, the constrictor has a meter. The\nmeter and the total gap between electrodes is 1.70\nsupersonic nozzle has an exit diameter of 46 cm. Gas is injected\n46\n.through :a eries of gaps between constrictor elements along a\nadjacent to the cathode.\ncm length of -constrictor\nA\n\nThe performance of the 2.54 cm constrictor diameter machine,\n\nover a range of pressure at the cathode and enthalpy of the nozzle\n\nOn this\n\nexit can best be shown by a performance "map" (fig. 2).\nplot each point r4preseits successful operation. One operational\n\nlimit on these devices is set .bythe maximum heat transfer rate\n\nthat can be accommodated. Therefore, superimposed oh this chart\n\nare two estimates of the performance limit for a heating rate of\n\n10 kw/cm2 . The limit for laminar flow (ref. 2) was calculated\n\nfor the maximum enthalpy that could be contained at a- given pres\xc2\xad\nsure. The limit for turbulent flow (ef. 3), again calculated\n\n\n\nfor 10 k:/cm 2 , is cal&ulated for a .2.54 cm diameter constrictor\n\n\nas opposed to the laminar flow limit, which was calculated for a\n\nconstrictor of variable size. \n Figure 2 shows the present operating\n\nrange as compared with both these limits. \n Note here that the\n\nproduction of high enthalpy gas (satellite enthalpy ,t 30 mj/kg)\n\npresents no formidable obstacles. However, to produce this gas\n\nat a respectable pressure, which is required for true Mach number\xc2\xad\nsimulation, forces operation near the limiting conditions. If\n\nthese-limits are correctly estimated, it would appear that the\n\nrequirements for high model surface pressures, high enthalpy flow,\n\nand- correct Mach number simulation are incompatible. However,\n\nhigh model surface pressures at high enthalpies can easily be\n\nobtained by employing a low area ratio nozzle at a sacrifice in test\n\nvolume.\n\nThe flow \'emanating from the nozzle can assume a variety of\n\nforms depending on the ratio between constrictor current density\n\nand cathode chamber pressure.

The portion on the left represents a con\xc2\xad\nstricted arc heater with a diameter of 12.7 mm and a length of\n30 cm. The nitrogen plasma flow is expanded to an area ratio\nof 10 and then shocked down to around 1/4 atm. stagnation pressure\nto produce a region in thermodynamic equilibrium. This equilib\xc2\xad\nrium flow is then expanded through an area ratio of 2.25 by a\nsecond nozzle, and spectroscopic measurements are made along the\n\nconstant-area region of the second nozzle.\n\nElectron density is determined from the width of\nbeta line, and the temperature is determined from the\nsity ratio either ,of an ion-atom pair or an atom-atom\ncontent of hydrogen added for the purpose of electron\nmeasurement was approximately 0.1 percent by volume.\n\n\nthe hydrogen\xc2\xad\nline inten\xc2\xad\npair. The\ndensity\n\n\nThe second slide shows how the electron density and the tem\xc2\xad\nperature are determined on the stream axis. The shape of the H\n\n\n*NAS-NSF Fellow. Research Associate\n\n\n50\n\nline is taken at various positions away from the axis by means of\na photomultiplier tube at the spectrograph exit plane. The result\xc2\xad\ning distribution is inverted by the Abel inversion formula, and\nfrom the widths of the H lines at the various radii, the electron\ndensity at each radial point is determined by the well-known\n\nformula: ne = 3.8 x 101\' (,L)a/2 cm-3. The intensities of\n\nselected line pairs are similarly measured as a function of\n\ndistance from the axis and inverted by Abel inversion to get\n\nthe intensities as a function of radius. Temperature is deter\xc2\xad\nmined from their ratios. As indicated in this particular example,\n\nboth the electron density and the temperature were almost constant\n\nover half the radius, and the centerline values were nearly equal\n\nto the integrated mean value across the horizontal plane through\n\nthe centerline.\n\nThe third slide shows the measured electron density variation\n\nin the flow direction. Data were taken at six different conditions\n\nof pressure and enthalpy. As shown here, for low electron density\n\ncases, the electron density decreases steadily along the test\n\nlength, indicating that at the first observation station the flow\n\nwas far from equilibrium--that is, the production of ions was\n\nnegligible. For the high electron density runs, however, the\n\nelectron density gradient seems to level off downstream, indicating\n\nthat even in the first test interval, the production term may not\n\nbe neglected. Flrom these data, rate coefficients can be determined\n\nif the velocity of the stream is known. For this purpose, the\n\nvelocity was measured by means of a time-of-flight method, using\n\na specially designed system which we call the "differentiated\xc2\xad\ndelayed-correlation time-of-flight meter." This system gave\n\ntypically around 7.5 km/sec stream velocity, a value -which falls\n\nbetween the calculated frozen and equilibrium limits.\n\nThe temperature determined by the ion-atom line intensity\n\nratio from the 3995A ion line and the 4935A atom line is around\n\nll,000.\xc2\xb0K throughout the second nozzle for all cases, whereas the\n\natom-atom line intensity ratio from the 4935A atom line and the\n\n5617A atom line produces temperatures that vary from 8500 K to\n\n11,500 K. A theoretical computation of the effect of nonequilib\xc2\xad\nriuln on spectroscopic temperature measurement has been carried\n\nout using the theory of Bates. It was found that the atom-atom\n\nline ratio method is unaffected by nonequilibrium for this tempera\xc2\xad\nture range, but the ion-atom ratio method yields doubtful results\n\nand is likely to overestimate the temperature. In the stagnation\n\nregion, one is almost certain that equilibrium prevails, and the\n\nstagnation temperature determined from the ion-atom ratio is\n\naround 13,000\xc2\xb0K. On the whole, therefore, the temperature\n\n\n51\nprobably.varies from 13,000\xc2\xb0K in the stagnation region to around\n\n10,0O0\xc2\xb0K in the test region.\n\nThe next slide summarizes the measured values of the rate\n\nconstant., The circled values are the measured values, determined\n\nfrom the approximate rate equation\ndn e\n\'dt\n\n=\n\nr e\n\nBy integrating, one gets\n\n1\n\n2\n\n.r\n\nT\n\n1\n\n1\n\nni \n\n\nn\n\n\ne2\n\nwhere T is the time interval, n\n\nel\n\n\nand n\n\nare the electron densities\n\n\nat the ends of the interval. Only the data from the interval\n\n-formed by the first two viewing ports are used. As seen here,\n\nthe rate constant for the high density runs is considerably lower\n\nthan that for the low density runs indicating that a significant\n\nproduction of ions occurs between the viewing ports. To determine\nthe contribution to the rate constant of ion production, a computer\n\nprogram was run to solve the nozzle flow relaxation problem for\n\nthree arbitrary values of rate constant.\nSince the exact rate equation is\n\ndn\n\nr eena\n-Krne3\n \n\n\ne\n-it\n\n\nthe integration gives\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nJ.-6c 2T\nT-\n\nU=\n\nKf na\n\nn\n\n1\n\nneE q\n\nK n\n\nKr\nr\n\nep\n\nU\n\n_\n\nel\n\nwhere\n\n\nr\n\ne\n\ne\n\n\nis the ratio of the ion production rate to the ion recombination\n\nrate. This parameter e is then computed for the different rate\n\nconstants but for the same stagnation condition. The resulting\n\nrecombination rate is shown by the cross marks in this figure.\n\n\n52\n\nthe resulting rate - from\n\nWhen the rate was assumed to be 102-2\n25.

Other effects such as radiation loss and\ndiffusion are estimated to be very small, and so they were all\n\nneglected. In conclusion, therefore, one can quote the rate as\n\n5.X 10\n 6 cm5 sec - \' at mOO0\xc2\xb0K.\n\nThe last slide compares the present results Mith existing\ndata. Shown on the slide are the recombination rate for hydrogen,\ncalculated by Bates; that for helium, measured by Hinnov and\n\'irschberg; \n and the theory of Bates carried out for nitrogen.\n\nAs is apparent, the present experimental result lies vell within\n\nthe expected range, and is 7 orders of magnitude smaller than the\n\nmolecular-ion recombination rate and 7 orders of magnitude greater\n\nthan the atomic recombination rate.\n\n\n+\n\n/\n\n<\n.1 p <.3 atmL\n11000<T< 14,000 K\n\n_\n\n_\n\n-tTc-\n\n__\n_\n\nVACUUM\n\n\nr\n\n500<V<900V\n300< I <750A\n\nSPECTROMETER\n\n10,000 OK\n\nQUARTZ\n\nWINDOW\n\n\n---\n\n-----\n\nA\nA\nNATIONALIONAUTICS AND SPACE OMINISTRA1IOt\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nFIELOD,\nMOFFETT\nCENTER,\nRESEARCH\nAMES\n\nNe\n//\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nORIGINAL HB SHAPE\n\nINVERTED H\n\n/\n/\\\n\n\nSHAPE\n\n5\n6x101\n\n2\n-4,\n-2\n\n\\\n\n-- r\nRADIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nOF ELECTRON DENSITY\n\nT\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n4935 A NI\n3995 A NIl\n\n/\n\n- 10 .\xc2\xb0K\\\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n~y\n\nINTENSITY OF LINES\nRADIAL DISTRIBUTION OF\n\nTEMPERATURE (ELECTRON)\n\n\nAOMINIStRAIION\nANDSPACE\nA\nNATIONALERONAUTICS\nFIELD,\nCALIFORNIA\nMORFETT\nCENtER,\nRESEArCH\nAMES\n\n4\n\nI\n\n\nPt atm\no\n\nNe xIO1\n\n.10\n.22\n.22\n.30\n\nA\n\nELECTRON\n\n12000\n\n0\n\nCENTERLINE\n\n.17,\n\nA\n\n3\n\nDENSITY\n-15\n\nTt, \xc2\xb0K\n\n.20\n\n13000\n13200\n3000\n12700\n13200\n\nI\n\n3\n\n,cm\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\nI\n\nII\nI\n_I\n\n-\'{\n\nDISTANCE\n\nI\n\nSI\nI\n\nI\n\nI -\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1__\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE OF NOZZLE\n\nI cm\n\nT\n\nNATIONALAERQNAU7ICSAND SPACE\nADMINISTRA ION\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nCENTER,MOFFEIT FIELD,\nAMES RESEARCH\n\nkr\xc2\xad\n\nU) too-25\n\nkr "\n\n10- 2 5\n\n_ \n\n\nE\n\no\n\na"\n\n-26\n\nN-26\n\n100\n\n2\n\ndi-2I)6\n\nLU\n\n5r\n\n:\n\ne6\\io-27\n\nMEASURED VALUES, REDUCED BY\n0 0NEGLECTING PRODUCTION TERM\nVALUES CORRECTED FOR PRODUCTION\n<-+\nzTERM,\nWITH ASSUMED kr\nz0\n\n0 io-27,\nL\n\n0\n\nM\n\nU\n\n2\n\nD1\n\n1-0\n\n,\n\n3\n\n4xVR\n\nELECTRON DENSITY AT FIRST WINDOW, cm -\n\n\nNAT1ONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACEADMINISFOATION\noAll\n2.\n2 10\n11D\'\n\n10-24\n\n\nNITROGEN, CALCULATED\nPARK (BATES THEORY)\n\nRECOMB INATION\nRATE COEFFICIENT\n\nNITROGEN, PRESENT\nMEASUREMENT\n\nkr\' cm 6 sec - I\n10 2 6\n\nHELIUM, MEASURED\nHINNOV a HIRSCHBERG\n\n-\n\nHYDROGEN, CALCULATED\nBATES, et al\n10- 27 L\n3\n10Io\n\n15\n\n4\nio\n\nlo\noG\n\nT, OK\n\nADMINISTRATION\nAND\nAERONAUTICS SPACE\nNATIONAL\nCALIFORNIA\nFIELD,\nMOFFETT\nCENTER,\nRESEARCH\nAMES\n\n58\nAbstract for presentation at the\n\nFifth NASA Intercenter and\n\nContractor Conference on Plasma Physics\n\nto be held at NASA Headquarters\nMay 24-26, 1966\n\nINVESTIGATION OF TRANSPORT PHENOMENA.

The first topic will be, a discussion of\nAhtye\'s derivation of an expression for the total thermal conductivity\nof partially and fully ionized gases. The present status of a\n.genei\'al computer program for calculating transport properties of\nternary gases,.to the third order in the Chapman-Enskog expansion will\nbe described. Preliminary values of transport coefficients from\nthis program will be compared with those using other theories.\n\nStallcop\'s general technique for calculating differential cross\xc2\xad\nsections will be described. This technique is applicable to the\n\ncase of elastic scattering between a neutral or ionized atom with\n\nanother neutral atom and may be extended to the case of resonant\ncharge exchange. The last topic will be a description of the low\nenergy ion beam experiments of Witteborn and Nichols. Their present\nexperiments to determine asymmetric charge-exchange cross sections,\nand future experiments to determine symmetric atomic charge-exchange\ncross-sections in the thermal range will be described.\n\n\nResearch Scientist\n\n59\n\nAbstract for presentation at the Fifth NASA Intercenter and Contractor\n\nConference on Plasma Physics, NASA Headquarters, May 24-26, 1966.\n\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nAmes Research Center\n\nMoffett Field, Calif.\n\n\nELECTRODE PHENOMENA IN HIGH ENERGY DENSITY DISCHARGES AS APPLIED\n\nTO PLASMA ACCELERATION PROBLEMS\nBy Helmut R. Poppa, Research Associate *\nAbstract\n\n\nPlasma-electrode interactions were investigated, studying in detail\n\nmicroscopic and submicroscopic changes in electrode surface structures and\n\nmorphology.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy of crystallographically well defined\n\nthin foil electrodes showed that the orientation dependence of the sputter\xc2\xad\ning yield is weak for low ion energies. Specifically, the difference in\n\n(50 eV to 500 eV\n\nsputtering yield for (100) and (111) oriented gold foils \n\nproperly oriented single\n\nargon ion energy) is of the order of 15%; use of\ncrystal discharge electrodes, therefore, will not reduce electrode destruc\xc2\xad\ntion significantly, even if ion bombardment sputtering should be the major\n\ncause for electrode disintegration.\n\nTransmission electron diffraction of Cu foils bombarded with 500 eV\n\nnitrogen ions (ion beam intensity u 0.07 mA/cm 2 ) revealed no sign of chemi\xc2\xad\ncal corrosion attack, another possible mechanism of electrode disintegration.\n\nReflexion electron diffraction of a bulk copper cathode exposed to a nitrogen\n\ndischarge in a coaxial plasma gun confirmed the negative corrosion results.\n\nCathode morphologies of two plasma gun types (coaxial and pulsed arc gun)\'\n\nwere studied by replica electron microscopy, as they developed during gun\n\noperation. Microscopic structure features found on electrode surfaces indi\xc2\xad\ncate the existence of small (5 to 50V ) areas of localized surface attack\n\n(cathode spots). The attack is so strong that localized melting of the\n\ncathode surface occurs. The melting hypothesis was verified by detecting\n\nchanges in cathode surface crystallography caused by localized melting of\n\ncathode material. Future discharge electrode research should concentrate on\n\ninvestigating properties and funcdion of cathode spots.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Work done under NASA Contract NASW-i03 while at General Dynamics,\n\nConvair Division, San Diego, California (Report GDC-DBE-66-002).\n\n\n6o\n\nAbstract for presentation at the Fifth NASA Intercenter and Contractor\n\nConference on Plasma Physics, May 24-27, 1966\n\n\nRESULTS OF THE PIONEER 6 AMES PLASMA PROBE EXPERI\'TS\n\nJohn H.

Spreiter\n\nSpace Sciences Division\n\nNASA Ames Research Center\n\nMoffett Field, California\n\nABSTRACT\nAnalysis of the flow of solar plasma around the quiet magnetosphere\n\nrequires consideration of a flow field having dimensions that are large\n\ncompared with the fundamental lengths through observations made by instru\xc2\xad\nments that are microscopic in comparison. In this paper, the large scale\nfeatures of the flow are determined by use of the continuum equations of\nsteady magnetohydrodynamic flow. The magnetosphere boundary is represented\nby a magnetohydrodynamic tangential discontinuity, and the bow wave by a\nfast magnetohydrodynamic shock wave. The connectivity of interplanetary\n\nand geomagnetic fields, and the asymptotic directions of the wake and shock\nwaves at great distances from the earth are discussed in terms of properties\n\nof these discontinuities. It is shown that these considerations lead directly\n\nthrough approximations of good accuracy to the simpler equations of the classi\xc2\xad\ncal Chapman-Ferraro theory for the shape of the magnetosphere boundary, and to\n\nthose of nonlinear gasdynamics for the surrounding flow. These equations are\n\nsolved numerically, and detailed results for the location of the bow wave and\n\nthe bulk properties of the flow in the transition region are presented for\n\nseveral representative Mach numbers and ratios of specific heats. These re\xc2\xad\nsults are combined with kinetic theory to determine specific numerical re\xc2\xad\nsults corresponding to observations that would be made by a variety of ideal-\xc2\xad\nized plasma probes on both oriented and spinning vehicles.\nFinally these\nresults are compared with actual data obtained by plasma probes and. proton\nanalyzers on earth satellites that traverse the magnetosphere boundary and\nits bow shock.\n\nPRINCIPLE PUBLICATIONS:\nSpreiter, John R. and A.

Semi-local heat flux\n\nmeasurements were obtained along the tube and nozzle by calorimetry in circum\xc2\xad\nfrential water coolant passages with passage widths relatively small compared\n\nto the nozzle radius. The ratio of wall to total enthalpy is small, being\n\nless than 5%. As a result of the high gas temperatures and relatively low\n\nstagnation pressures (between 0.1 and 0.3 atm) Reynolds numbers are low and\n\nthe boundary layers are laminar,\n\nA meaningful representation of the heat transfer data requires a pre\xc2\xad\nscription of the core flow conditions. Mr. Massier, in the preceeding paper,\n\ndescribed the core flow variables of interest - the mass flux PeUe ,\n stagnation\n\nenthalpy Hto and static temperature - and various prediction methods by which\n\nthese are obtained by utilizing the wall static pressure measurements. Experi\xc2\xad\nmental determination of the core flow requires either gas temperature or stag\xc2\xad\nnation enthalpy measurement in addition to the measured wall static pressure\n\ndistribution.\n\n\nFor the tests presented here, radiation from the gas is negligible com\xc2\xad\npared to convection. By locating the electric arc around the corner from the\n\ntube radiation from the arc is essentially eliminated. With this arrangement\n\nbetter mixing is also achieved, but at the expense of secondary flows in the\n\nentrance region of the tube.\n\nLocal heat transfer coefficients along the tube and nozzle are presented\n\nin terms of a laminar boundary layer heat transfer group\n\neUe\nq\nPto\nw pu)(oeu\n\nIn this relation q is the heat flux to the wall, Peueis the local mass flux,\nPeUehLe is a Reynolds number per unit length and (Hto -\n\n1w) is the driving\n\n66\n\n,potential between the stagnation enthalpy and wall enthalpy. Properties denoted\n\nby i refer to the nozzle inlet Condition. This representation should correlate\n\ndata for un-ionized laminar boundary layers\'. \'Rather good agreement along the\n\ntube and nozzle is found between a relatively low stagnation enthalpy test\n\n(Hto = 1190 BTU/lb) for which the ionization energy fraction is negligible and\n\nthe prediction from Ref.\'2, except in the throat and divergent section of the\n\nndzzle where the data lie below the prediction. For tests at higher stagna\xc2\xad\ntion enthalpies up to 6800 BTU/lb and ionization energy fractions up to 0.5\n\nthe heat transfer group from Eq. (1) follows the trend indicated from laminar\n\nboundary layer predictions (Ref. 1) for a partially ionized gas where the group\n\nfrom Eq. (1) should decrease as the ionization energy fraction increases.\n\nHowever, the higher stagnation enthalpy results lie considerably below the pre\xc2\xad\ndictions downstream of some point in the flow. This point moves upstream as\n\nthe stagnation enthalpy is increased. This same trend is evident for other\n\ntests that spanned a range of stagnation enthalpies from 3000\'to 6000 BTU/Ib\n\nand corresponding ionization energy fractions from 0.25 to 0.5, but which were\n\nobtained with a shorter length of tube such that the length to diameter ratio\n\nwas 2.5 instead of 4.7 for the previously mentioned tests.\n\ntI\nTo provide some insight on the relatively low values of the heat trans\xc2\xad\nfer group found for the higher stagnation enthalpy tests, values of stagnation\n\nenthalpy, temperature and ionization energy fraction aT/Hto are shown in\n\nTable I. The average stagnation enthalpies at the nozzle inlet as determined\n\nfrom overall energy balances are seen to be appreciably below the average stag\xc2\xad\nnation enthalpies at the outlet of the electric arc heater. Spectroscopic\n\nmeasurements by the relative atom line intensity method just upstream of the\n\nnozzle inlet indicate temperatures appreciably above the average values at\n\nthe nozzle inlet. Since these measured temperatures are nearer the average\n\ntemperatures at the outlet of the electric arc heater, adiabatic core \n\nflow\n\nthrough the tube and nozzle was assumed in calculating the driving potential,\n\nHto - H,, in the heat transfer group of Eq. (1). However, as was noted, the\nvariation of the heat transfer group along the nozzle indicates that as the\n\nstagnation enthalpy increases the point of deviation from the laminar boundary\n\nlayer predictions for an adiabatic core flow moved upstream. This trend sug\xc2\xad\ngests that the lower values of the heat transfer group at the higher stagnation\n\nenthalpies may be due to non-adiabatic core flow downstream of some point in\n\nthe flow where the thermal boundary layer may have reached the centerline. If\n\nthis occurred the driving potential is less and the heat transfer is lower.\n\nConsequently, an appraisal of the effect of ionization on heat transfer that\n\nis indicated-by theory is probably obscured by the large energy abstraction\n\nfrom the flow.\n\nMention should be made of previous comparisons between laminar boundary\n\nlayers predictions and heat transfer data shown in Ref. 3 for negligible ioni\xc2\xad\nzation energy fraction tests. In these previous results, obtained with the\n\nelectric arc heater located axially upstream of the nozzle, the experimentally\n\ndetermined laminar boundary layer heat transfer group shown in Figs. 6, 7 and\n\n8 -of Ref. 3 would be lower if the average total enthalpy at the outlet of the\n\nelectric arc heater were used in the driving potential rather than the average\n\ntotal enthalpy at the nozzle inlet which was used. Better agreement with the\n\nlaminar boundary layer prediction (Eq. 10 in Ref. 3 which is essentially the\n\nsame as that of Ref. 2) would be achieved, although the nature of the boundary\n\nlayer at the nozzle inlet is not well known for these tests as a result of the\n\nseparated flow region downstream of the step at the outlet of the electric\n\narc heater.\n\n\n67\n\nTo acquire further knowledge of heat transfer from high temperature par\xc2\xad\ntially ionized gases, core flow measurements are needed at various axial and\n\nradial locations. Additional spectroscopic measurements and cooled traversing\n\nprobe meisurements are planned. To enhance mixing an electric arc heater\n\nconsisting of three circumfrentially spaced are heads that discharge into a\n\nplenum chamber will be used. Heat transfer measurements in a sharp edged\'\n\ntube attached to the outlet of the plenum chamber and in a convergent-divergent\n\nnozzle are planned..\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \t\nBack, L.

Bratenah!\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe magnetic neutral line is a geometrical locus that occurs in a region\n\nwhere there is a hyperbolic arrangement of lines of force. The asymptotic\n\nlines of the hyperbolic arrangement generate two intersecting surfaces. The\n\nintersection of these surfaces is the magnetic neutral line. Although the\n\nneutral line is perpendicular to the field in its neighborhood, the field must\n\nvanish at all points on the neutral line itself. This is the usual definition\n\nof neutral line, but it is inadequate for our purposes. We now extend this\n\ndefinition by adding a field which, though otherwise arbitrary, must be tangent\n\nto the neutral line at all of its points. The original hyperbolic field, we\n\nnow call B-L\nthe added component,\n.\nThe topological significance of the\nneutral line is unchanged by the addition of the component Bn,\nand we assert\nin the light of this extended definition that: changes of magnetic flux between\ntubes belonging to different source systems, either"magnetic poles" or currents,\ncan occur if and only if neatral lines are present. The proof of this theorem\nfollows a topological argument in which it &s seen that the change is merely\na "severing and reconnecting" of lines of BL at the neutral line. It is well\nknown that this process of "severing and reconnecting" is nontrivial if the\nconductivity of the medium is large. The rate of reconnection in a conducting\nmedium is controlled by the process of resistive diffusion, expressed by the\nequation,\n\nThe above remarks make it clear that, for instance, no hydromagnetic dynamo\n\n(astrophysical dynamo) is possible without the presence of such neutral lines,\n\nand an understanding of the plasma behavior at such lines is therefore of great\n\ntheoretical importance. Neutral lines are a topological property of a geomet\xc2\xad\nrical system of magnetic sources and are therefore in no way "destroyed" (as\n\nsome people have said) unless the source geometry is destroyed or altered into\n\nsome "degenerate" form. Theoretical study of the neutral point problem has a\n\nlong history in which great emphasis has been placed on a search for mechanisms\n\nwhich provide a high rate of reconnection so as to aecount, for instance, for\n\nthe solar flare. Prior to our experiment (which appears to be the first spe\xc2\xad\ncifically undertaken for this purpose), the most successful theory from the\n\npoint of view of fast rates would appear to be Petscheck\'s.\n\nThis paper presents the results of one phase of research carried out at\n\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under\n\nContract No. NAS7-100, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space\n\nAdministration.\n\nPetscheck, H. E., NASA SP-50, p. 425, U. S. Govt. Printing Office, 1964.\n\n\n70\n\nThe experiment, as might be expected, has introduced a number of new\n\nconcepts, and provides the basis for considerable extension of existing\n\ntheory. Besides providing a remarkably good accounting for the solar flare\n\n(tegarded as a characteristic group of related phenomena), we have at hand,\n\nI think, the ingredients for a completely new concept of hydromagnetic\n\nsteady-state turbulence under conditions in which the mean magnetic pressure\n\nexceeds the gas pressure.\n\nThe experiment produces a neutral line at the line of first contact of\ntwo cylindrical shock waves (double inverse pinch apparatus), Figure 1. The\ngas is pre-donized and the regiqn behind the hydromagnetic shocks is highly\nconducting. After collision, and some initial diffusive interpenetration of\nfields, we have a configuration consisting of two parallel lint currents at\nx\n\xc2\xb1 a , a neutral line at x = 0 , and a coaxial return path in the merged\nshocks now at larger radius, Figure 2. We have three flux linkages, one each\naround the two line currents, and one linkage about both. As the current\ncontinues to increase from I to I +A I , the return path for the increase\n,A I is found to lie entirely in the neighborhood of the neutral line,\'causing\na pinch or compression of the gas into a sheet, Figure\n\n3, along the \xc2\xb1 y-axis\n\n-and a closing of the angle between the asymptotic lines of the hyperbolic\n\nneutral point. These observations are best expressed the other way around:\n\nthe gas, whose pressure is the lesser of the two principal stresses, retreats\n\ninto the region of minimum magnetic pressure, the neighborhood of the neutral\n\nline. Only by this retreat can the gas acquire a pressure gradient that can\n\noppose the gradient of the magnetic pressure. Since the current is concen\xc2\xad\ntrated in the magnetic pressure gradient, the concentration of current may be\n\nregarded as a direct consequence of the compression\nof the medium and\n\nwould not occur otherwise. There is a simple relation between the current\n\ncondentration, the current density at the origin, and the angle 0 between\n\nthe x-axis and the asymptotic lines of the neutral point,\n\n\n(2) \n\n\n~~\n\n7 - 46j_,\n\nin which the integral is finite and is determined by the geometry and strength\n\nof the external current sources. We see .that if &\napproaches\n4, the\n\ncurrent density at the origin approaches a Dirac! S-function. This, in fact,\n\nis exactly what does happen and it occurs in a time\nT = a/Vg\n, where\n\'V\n\nis the Aifvgn speed. The physical reason for this is a rearrangement of the\n\ngas taking place in the pinch. The gas lying between the asymptotic lines\n\nand the y-axis is expelled at a velocity\n6xly by the magnetic\n\nforce component J.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This ejection, which we call the "surge," takes\n\nplace during 6 T -and terminates this time interval by the removal of the\n\ninternal gas and magnetic support so that the asymptotic lines can approach\n\ntangency at the origin. If the conductivity were infinite, the removal of\n\nsupport by the surge ejection would be complete; the resulting configuration\n\nwould be a pinch of zero thickness at the origin, with infinite current density\n\nbut no electric field and no flux change. We define this condition as the\n\ncritical state. The rate of approach to this state, however, is controlled\n\nby dynamic forces and flows and so is independent of the conductivity. In\n\nactuality, the conductivity is never infinite and so the electric field\n\ncan always reach sufficiently high.values to "gate" through the neutral point\n\n\n71\n\n\nall the magnetic flux-that has -beenaccumulating during the time A6 T.\n\nThis fact is guaranteed by the elistence of the "virtual" critical state,\n\nand by the impulsive growth of E as the critical state is approached.\n\nWe obtain the remarkable result that the resistive diffusion time becomes\n\nshorter the higher the conductivity. To understand this apparent paradox,\n\nnote that equation (1) implies a scaling relation between the diffusion\n\ntime6t , the conductivity - and the length R on which diffusion is\n\ntaking place, the familiar skin-depth relation,\n\n<\n\nWe have seen that the dynamics of ejection causes (- and .e to be inversely\n\nrelated on account of the existence of the critical state. Because of the\n\nexponent on AP in (3), t and b- become inversely related, and the\n\nreduction of thickness is greater than the increase in conductivity causing\n\nthis reduction. The impulsive growth of E permits a corresponding impulsive\n\nrate of change of flux. This "flash phase" has been observed in our laboratory\n\nexperiments. In fact it has been observed to repeat several times as a relax\xc2\xad\nation oscillation with the period.AT - Asec (under our conditions), and\n\nis accompanied by a corresponding flip-flop between the two configurations:\n\ncurl-free neutral point, and sheet pinch, Figure 4.\n\nWe may expect, when we make the appropriate observations, that the\nresidual gas remaining after the "surge" would be expelled at the much higher\n\nvelocity E/B as a "spray" during this "flash phase" and the current carriers\nwould enjoy the run-away process along the\nz-axis, reaching energies as high\nas eV . The fact is, the relaxation oscillation is a non-linear dynamic\nprocess that effects a trade-off which favors particle acceleration in place\nof ohmic dissipation as the preferred mode of energy dissipation.\n-\n\nIn terms of the solar flare, taking 25,000 kilometers as typical of half\nthe distance between relevant sunspots and dividing by the typical surge velocity\n50 km/sec as representative of the Alfven speed, we come out with 500 sec, or\n8_ minutes for.4 T , which3,being the rise-time of our model flare, is seen to\nbe in excellent agreement with observations. We see also three distinct particle\nenergy spectra produced, the two most energetic of which occur during the violent\n"flash-phase." In addition, our flare can repeat since it is basically a re\xc2\xad\nlaxation oscillation.\nSince we are discussing a special form of pinch, we give it the name\n\nhyperbolic pinch so that we may conveniently compare it with the more familiar\n\nelliptic pinch in which the field lines encircle the current, Table I;\n\nTABLE I\n\nElliptic Pinch\n\nHyperbolic Pinch\n\n1) Number of Boundary Conditions\n2) Hydromagnetic Stability\n3) Resistive Stability\n\none\nno\nyes\n\ntwo\nyes\nyes or no\n\n4) Ohmic Distruction of Flux\n\nyes\n\nyes or no\n\non 2nd\n\n5) Production of NeTu Flux Linkage\n6) Natural Occurrence Likely\n\nno\nno\n\nyes or no\nyes\n\nboundary\ncondition\n\nDepending\n\n572\n\n\nItem (1) of Table I reveals an interesting property. The two opposing\npairs of sectors separated by the asymptotic lines may be separately controlled;,\nthe added degree of freedom permits a wide and subtle range of effects. If\nthe ejection -on the y-axis is uninhibited, we say the y-boundary condition\nis "free." We have seen that relaxation oscillation is the preferred mode\nin this case since proximity to the critical state is controlled by the con\xc2\xad\nductivity. If, however, conducting rods are introduced on the y-axis, at\nsay y = \xc2\xb1 a , the field due to the induced currents in them will interfere\nwith the flow so that proximity to the critical state is now controlled by\n\nthis interference. The relaxation oscillation is blocked, and a mode resembling\n\nPetscheckrs steady-state solution is observed. We propose this to be the\n\nprocess taking place in quiescent prominances. If currents in these rods are\n\nexternally driven exactly out of .phase with those on the x-axis, the y-boundary\n\ncondition is "rigid,\' the flow completely inhibited, and we have Harold Grad\'s\n\ncusp geometry. \'Some of these effects have been observed and studied in our\n\nexperiments.\n\nItem (6) of the table is of great significance. The elliptic-pinch\nrequires the inward flow of energy from a continuous sheet current surrounding\nthe pinch. If the continuity of this sheet is broken, there will also be\nhyperbolic pinches present. This seems to be a complicated and unrealistic\nb6undary condition to expect to find occurring in a natural system. On the\nother hand, the minimum requirement for a hyperbolic pinch is two parallel\nline.currents, or a dipole field interacting with almost any other kind of\nfield. The relative simplicity of the latter requirement is obvious. Item\n(6) is strongly supported by Item (2).\n\nItem (5) relates the hyperbolic pinch to the dynamo. It also provides\na much needed mechanism for maintaining a minimum time-average of the total\nmagnetic field energy compatible with steady state but random change taking\nplace in the source distribution (the turbulence problem). It must be empha\xc2\xad\nsized, the hyperbolic pinch can only occur if the magnetic pressure exceeds\ng\nthe \t as pressure in the mean.\n\nDuring the coming year, we hope to investigate this pinch with the use of\n\na ruby-laser Schlieren system employing the technique developed by Ralph\n\nLoveberg at U. C. San Diego. We also expect to apply these results in con\xc2\xad\nsiderable detail to a number of processes taking place in the solar atmosphere.\n\nTwo papers have been presented,on this subject:\n\n\t\n1. \tBratenahl, A.yand Hirsch, W., Paper X-8, Plasma Phys.

Mechanisms responsible for the ion\xc2\xad\nization of the gas have also been advanced. The following mechanisms have been\n\nproposed; multiphoton ionization, microwave breakdown, tunnel auto-ionization,\n\nand inverse Bremsstrahlung. In this report experimental evidence is presented\n\nwhich shows that the most probable mechanism for electron production is due to\n\ninverse Bremsstrahlung and subsequent electron impact ionization.\n\nA Q-switched giant pulse Ruby laser (6943R) capable of delivering up to\n\n100 megawatts is focused at a focal point by a lens in an argon atmosphere of\n\npressure from a few milimeters of mercury up to one atmosphere. The gas break\xc2\xad\ndown at the focal point is observed by an electrostatic probe. The number\n\ndensity of the charged particles produced as a function of time at different\n\npressures is obtained by measuring the conductivity of the plasma drop produced\n\nat the focal point of the laser beam. The energy of the electrons in the plasma\n\ndrop is obtained from the measurement of the time rate of growth of the size of\n\nthe plasma drop.\n\nAn estimation of the ionization has also been made based upon the assump\xc2\xad\ntion that some pre-existing electrons gain energy from the laser radiation\n\nthrough inverse Bremsstrahlung processes aud ionize the gas by excitational\n\ncollisions with the gas atoms. By using the concept of the mutual absorption\n\ncoefficient for the photon-electron interaction given by Wheeler ard Wildt, the\n\nelastic and excitational collision cross-section given by Petschek and Byron\n\nand assuming the rate of ionization to be limited by the rate of excitation to\n\nthe first excited state, the electron density has been computed for the same\n\nconditions as in the experiment. The experimental data agree quite well with\n\nthe \t\ntheoretical calculations. Both the experimental and theoretical results\n\nindicate that at lower pressures a large fraction of the electrons is produced\n\nafter the cessation of the laser pulse which is about 20 n sec. An estimation\n\nof the time required for the electron to break through the atomic potential\n\nbarrier indicated that this time is about 5xl0- 14 sec. This time interval can\xc2\xad\nnot account for the lag of production of charged particles behind the laser\n\npulse. Therefore, the possibility of multiphoton absorption and tunnel auto\xc2\xad\nionization as a main mechanism responsible for the production of charged parti\xc2\xad\ncles behind the laser beam can be excluded. The microwave breakdown theory is\n\nequivalent to Compton absorption in the quantum mechanical sense. The rate of\n\nenergy absorption of the electron by this mechanism is estimated to be several\n\norders of magnitude less than the observed values. Therefore, the microwave\n\nbreakdown mechanism also can be excluded. The possibility of production of a\n\nsmall amount of high energy electrons by photo-ionization which ionizes the gas\n\nby impact without the inverse Bremsstrahlung process, can be excluded by cross,\n\nsection considerations. It is therefore concluded that the ionization process\n\nin the gas irradiated by a laser beam is inverse Bremsstrahlung and electron\n\ninelastic collisions.\n\n\n78\n\nB. \t\nVelocity profile measurement in plasma flows using tracers produced\n\nby a laser beam\n\nSince a plasma drop is composed of a highly luminous and almost fully\n\nionized gas, the motion of the drop can be detected by the electrostatic probe,\n\ndrum camera and other techniques. Furthermore, the velocity of the drop will\n\n-follow the velocity of the fls0 accurately. Therefore, the drop can be used as\n\na tracer for a flow velocity measurement. The following two methods are used\n\nto detect the motion of the plasma drop produced by the laser beam,\n\n1. \t\nElectrostatic Probe Method\n\nAn electrostatic probe is located at a known distance (- 5 mm)\ndownstream of the focal point of the laser beam in a plasma flow.\nThe time required for the drop to travel from the focal point to the\nprobe is measured by the time elapsed between the initiation of the\nlaser pulse and the point of the maximum signal from the probe.\nThe\nvelocity of the flow is thus obtained from the time and distance data.\n2. \t\nDrum Camera Method\n\nA drum camera having film traveling at speeds up to 100 m/sec\n\nis focused at the vertical plane of a plasma flow containing the path\n\nof the plasma drop. The velocity of the flow is obtained from the\n\nangle between the direction of film motion and that of the streaks\n\nformed by the luminous plasma drop.\n\nThe plasma tracer method of measuring flow in the present set-up\n\nhas an accuracy better than 3%. New features of the method are: \n(a)\n\nhigh spatial resolution--it can give an average velocity over a\n\nvolume less than 10- 3 cm3; (b) minimum disturbance in the flow.\n\nThe drum camera technique has been used successfully to measure\n\nvelocity profiles in supersonic free jets. The results of this\n\nexperimental study are summarized in Ref. 1.\n\nC. \tPartition of Recombination Energy in an Argon Plasma\n\nIn the collisional-radiative electron-ion recombination regime, the energy\n\nliberated from each recombination is partly carried away by the third colliding\n\nfree electron and partly transformed into radiation. The partition of the energy\n\namong the electrons and radiat on is predicted by comparing the probability of\n\nthe collisional de-excitation at different energy states in the atoms, calcula\xc2\xad\nted using Gryzinski\'s formulation, and the spontaneous transition probability\n\nof the bound electron to all lower states evaluated by using the central field\n\napproximation. A recombination-dominated decaying plasma is produced by a\n\ndischarge tube energized with a capacitor bank.

This shock tube has been\n\ndesigned qpacifically to provide information on the initial, atom-atom and\n\nelectron-atom, ionization relaxation processes which occur behind strong (M >6)\n\nshock waves in the noble gases. Of particular interest is the delineation\n\nof the various inelastic and elastic interactions which influence both the\n\nelectron density and the electron temperature profiles.\n\nWhen a strong shock wave propagates through a body of gas, ionization\n\nrelaxation occurs, i.e. the electron density of the body of gas behind the\n\nshock increases. This ionization process can be roughly divided into two\n\nstages.\n\nImmediately after the passage of the shock front the electron density\n\n\nbuilds up, as a linear function of time, the predominant ionization reaction\n\nbeing the electron temperature independent atom-atom two-step excitation\xc2\xad\nionization process. When a sufficiently large number of electronshave been\n\nproduced by this process the more efficient electron-atom ionization process\n\nbecomes dominant. During this phase the electron generation rate is a function\n\nof the electron density and temperature.\n\nThe first stage (i.e., atom-atom ionization has been studied, the(1 )\n\nreaction delineated and the cross-sections for Ar, lr and Xe determined,\n\n\nCalculations by Petschek and Byron(2 ) concerning the onset (i.e., transition\n\nfrom atom-atom to electron-atom dominated ionization), of electron-atom ioniza\xc2\xad\n\ntion predicted transition electron densities which are a full order of magni\xc2\xad\ntude higher than were observed in the studies of Ref. 1.\n\nThis indicated that\n\n\na reaction hitherto unaccounted for in any analysis of the post shock ioniza\xc2\xad\ntion process was operative, viz. evaluation of electron temperature by atom\xc2\xad\natom ionization collisions. This interesting reaction is now being studied\n\nanalytically and with the completion of the shock tube will be experimentally\n\ninvestigated as well.\n\nIn order to accomplish these ionization studies, which involve only,\nweakly ionized gases, i.e., gases with ionization levels of < i0 , it is\nmandatory that the impurity level of the test gases be restricted to levels\nof the order of 10\' 6 (l-PPX) or less. Previous experiments 3 ) have demonstrated\nthat, should the level of contamination exceed this level by a factor of 10 or\n\nmore, spurious results could be expected. Consequently, the shock tube is be\xc2\xad\ning designed to be baked and permit evacuation to pressures below 10-6 torr.\n\nAs a consequence, the combined leak and outgassing rates are anticipated (on\n\n1\nthe basis of previous work( )) to be such that, the overall impurity level\n\nwill meet requirements. The test gas flow system allows a flow of the pre\xc2\xad\nshock test gas (at pressures around 10 torr) to sweep out and dilute contami\xc2\xad\nnants present from outgassing and leaks.\n\nThere will be three major diagnostic systems employed on this experi\xc2\xad\nment. Atom temperature will be inferred from shock velocity data gathered by\n\nshadowgraph shock position indicators and recorded on a high precision\n\n\noscilloscope raster display. The electronics,fr the majority of this system,\n\nhave been well proven in previous applications\'1 ) . This system will permit not\n\nonly the mean shock velocity to be measured but also shock attenuation. A\n\nkn6wledge of shock attenuation is necessary, as any small variation in atom\n\ntemperature due to variation in Mach number along the slug of heated gas pas\xc2\xad\nsing the observation station would have a large effect upon the ionization\xc2\xad\nrate in the atom-atom regime. The effects of shock attenuation have to be\n\naccounted for in both the atom-atom and the electron-atom regime, as electron\n\n.generation rates can be increased by a factor of 2 or more above the zero at\xc2\xad\ntenuation case by modest levels (2%/meter) of shock attenuation in argon.\nElectron densities in the range 011 N e S 1014 will be measured by\n\ntwo \t\nindependent microwave systems mounted so as to be transverse to the shock\n\ntube, the microwave beams propogating through the quartz diagnostics section\n\nof the tube. One system will operate at a nominal fre yency of 24 GHz and\n\nprovide electron density information over the range 101y : N e\n101-3. This\n\nsystem will monitor the measurable phase anhd the amplitudes of tl~e signals\n\ntransmitted through and reflected from the shock generated plasma. The cir\xc2\xad\ncuitry for this system (4 and the procedures for its proper adaptation to the\n\nshock tube 0 I\' 4 ) have been well tested and shown to be adequate. A similar,\n\n90,0 GHz system is in the process of being assembled. The power generation\n\nand modification portion of the circuitry have been completed. The 24 ,GHZ\n\n\t\nsystem is available and requires only very minor modification for aplication\n\nto the tube.\n\n\'The third diagnostic tool will be the high resolution spectroscopes\n\navailable to this project (Jarrell-Ash 3M, AL 1.5M). These devices-will be\n\nemployed to determine the electron temperature history of the gas behind the\n\nshock and to.provide an insight into the manner in which the excited stages\n\nare \t\npopulated and de-populated, in an effort to refine our understanding of\n\nthe \t nfluence that radiative processes have upon the ionization reactions.\n\ni\nIt is anticipated that once the main task of the investigation of the\n\nionization transition region is completed, that a study of the degree to which\n\nresonance radiation trapping contributes to atom-atom ionization will be\n\nundertaken. This study will require the use of Vacuum ultra-violet spectro\xc2\xad\nscopic techniques as; the resonance radiation from the noble gases of interest\n\noccur at r 1000 A0 . Future work will include the study of the atom-atom,\n\nand electron-atom ionization processes under the influence of electric and\n\nmagnetic fields to contribute to our knowledge of these more generalized,non\xc2\xad\nequilibrium processes. To pursue these studies the shock tube proper (ex\xc2\xad\nclusive of the dielectric diagnostic section) will be constructed of non\xc2\xad\nmagnetic metal tubing.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \t\nKelly, A.

Massier, Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nThe objectives of this investigation are to determine the influence of\n\nionization, acceleration, and applied magnetic and electric fields \n heat\n\non\ntransfer and fluid dynamics of steady internal flows of partially ionized\n\ngases. Both the analytical and the experimental work conducted thus far has\n\nbeen concentrated on the effect of thermal ionization and acceleration, par\xc2\xad\nticularly for argon.\n\n\'The investigation was initiated as a consequence of the interest and\n\nthe limited understanding of the heat transfer and the fluid flow phenomena\n\nassociated with steady-flow electrical propulsion and power generation devices\n\nand plasma test facilities. The containment of high-temperature thermally\n\nionized gases and the expansion of the flow to supersonic velocities impose\n\nsevere cooling requirements on mixing chamber and nozzle walls as well as on\n\nthe anode. Experiments conducted thus far pertaining to the influence of\n\nionization and acceleration on heat transfer from argon have ranged between\n\n0.1 and 2.0 atmospheres pressure. The ratio of the ionizatio- energy to total\n\nenergy content of the gas as determined by energy balance has ranged from es\xc2\xad\nsentially zero to about 0.5.\n\nApproximate radiative heat transfer from subsonic non-accelerating flows\n\nof argon have been determined by calculation as well as experimentally by means\n\nof a circumfrential cavity used as a segment of the flow passage. \nFor pres\xc2\xad\nsures in the vicinity of 0.2 atm., at which the cavity results were obtained,\n\nit was found that the radiative heat flux is less than 2% of the convective\n\nheat flu.\nA sketch of the test apparatus with the cavities is shown in\n\nFigure 1.\n\nSeveral models of the fluid flow have been selected to aid in the\n\nanalysis of the experimental data and to provide boundary conditions for making\n\ntheoretical heat transfer predictions. These models are differentiated by as\xc2\xad\nsumptions which include: equilibrium flow, nonequilibrium flow, adiabatic\n\ncore flow with a non-adiabatic laminar boundary layer, and non-adiabatic uni\xc2\xad\nform flow. The need for a variety of models is a consequence of the high en\xc2\xad\nthalpies encountered, the recombination effects, and the ranges of operating\n\nconditions. For an equilibrium adiabatic core flow without viscous effects or\n\nradiation, the equations of motion contain the following variables:\n\nEntrophy:\n\nSs = fl( a, T s, P)\n\n()\n\n\na s = f2Ts, Ps)\n\n\n(2).\n\n\nSaha:\n\n\nState:\n\nPs = (1\n\n+\n\na) psRT s\n\n(3)\n\n84\n\nContinuity:\n\nI=\n\n(4)\n\np 8 VAe\n\n2\n\n\nEnthalpy: \t\n= 5/2 (l +\n\nHt\n\n,s)RTs + cs1o +-\n\n(5)\n\n0\n\nMomentum:\n\nI\n\n1\n\ndPs\n\ndp\n\n+ Vdv\n\n\n-\n\n0\t\n\n(6)\n\nThe flow variables obtained by measurement are the wall static pressure\n\nfrom an energy\n\nPs, the mass flow rate 1, the flow cross sectional area A., and\n\nbalance the inlet stagnation enthalpyHto.\n\nIn a constant-diameter section the\n\n\nflow is one-dimensional and the flow variables are obtained by using equations\n\n(1) - (5) in which there are 5 unknowns: the velocity V, and static values of\n\nthe entropy Ss, the ionization fraction us, the gas temperature Ts, and the\n\nStagnation values are obtained by setting V = 0 and equating the\n\nPs.\ndensity \t\n=\nstagnation and static entropies, i.e., Ss \n St. In addition Equations (1) \xc2\xad\n(3) are used replacing the static values with stagnation values. The unknowns\n\nare at, Tt and Pt.\n\nIn an accelerating flow, Equation (4) is replaced with Equation (6)\n\nwhich allows the flow to be quasi two-dimensional. For this case there are\n\nagain 5 equations with 5 unknowns.\n\nFor nonadiabatic uniform flow, allowance is made for the heat transfer\xc2\xad\nred to the wall. This is of significance as a limiting case to allow for the\n\nthermal boundary layer thicknesses that extend to the centerline of the pas\xc2\xad\nsage. To account for the heat transfer, Equation (7) is added.\n\nEnergy:\n\nHt =Ht\n\nZ Q\t\n\n(7)\n\nOne additional unknown is introduced by Equation (7) which is the local stagna\xc2\xad\ntion enthalpy lt. Q represents the heat transfer which is determined from\ncalorimetric measurements obtained in numerous coolant passages along the test\n\napparatus. For an accelerating flow the equations for this case are (1), (2),\n\n\n(3), (5), (6) and (7).\n\nFor a nonequilibrium accelerating flow additional equations are -needed\n\nto account for the recombination rates and the consequent influence of the re\xc2\xad\ncombination on the electron temperature.\n\nResults obtained from the experiments coupled with the adiabatic core\n\nflow analyses establish the flow variables that are essential for making com\xc2\xad\nparisons with boundary layer predictions. The important variables at the free\n\nm\nstream edge of the boundary layer are the \t ass flux, psV, the stagnation\n\nT\nenthalpy, Hto and the static temperature \t s .

Maxorthy and G. Yonas\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\nWe are measuring the character of the flow of a conducting fluid as\nit passes over a bluff body suspended in an aligned magnetic field. -A\nflow tunnel which pumps liquid sodium (at 1350C) around a closed loop is\nused for this purpose and is shown in Fig. 1. The nature of the flow\nthrough the test section has been determined and found to be suitable for\naerodynamic testing except under the most adverse circumstances (very\xc2\xad\nstrong magnetic fields and very low flow rates).\nThree types of test have been used to look at\'the flow field:\n\ni) Drag measurements. Using a three-wire suspension system and\n\nconventional high-temperature strain gauge techniques, the drag of spheres\n\nand disks of various sizes has been measured. Typical results are shown\n\nin Fig. 2, where the drag coefficient is plotted against the interaction\n\nparameter N (ratio of Lorentz force to inertia force). As N becomes\n\nlarge CD\n-N and is the same for disks and spheres.\n\nii) Pressure distribution measurements. A special rotating sphere\n\nmechanism allows us to measure the distribution of static pressure as a\n\nfunction of angular position around a sphere. Again at large N the\n\ndistribution has the character shown in Fig. 3. The large increase in\n\ndrag is seen to be due mainly to a large increase, in the suction pressure,\n\nbehind the 4phere and, secondaril, to a more uniform distribution of the\n\nstagnation pressure over the front of the sphere.\n\niii) Wake measurements. Using slightly modified Pitot-static probes,\n\nit is possible to probe the velocity and pressure distribution field behind\n\nthe sphere. Attempts are being made to measure these quantities in front\n\nof a sphere but with limited success so far. Immediately behind a sphere,\n\nat large N , a stagnant region of fluid is formed. At distances larger\n\nthan the sphere radius, the axial velocity is considerably in excess of the\n\nfree stream velocity.- A very intense shear layer joins these two regions.\n\nA composite picture of the flow at large (but not infinite) t is\n\nshown in Fig. 41 and this includes all of the reliable information available\n\non such flows.\n\nThis paper presents the results of one phase of research carried out at\n\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under\nContract No. NAS7-100, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.\n\n\n88\nEXPANSION\n\nTANK\n\nWIDEANGLE\nDIFFUSER\nWITH\nSCREENS\n\n\nI\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC\nFLOWMETER\n\nHEATING\nBLANKET\n\n\n\'Ip\n\nNOZZLE/-\n\n7N.\n\nSr\n\n\nMAGNET --MOTION\n\n\nBCENTRIFUGAL\n\nETIN\nPROBE\nP\n\nMOTION\nFILTER\nPUP60-ft\n\nTRAVERSING\nMECHANISM\n\nNARROW-ANGLE,---\n\nDIFFUSER\n\n--\n\nMAGNETIC FIELD LINES\n\nFLUID STREAMLINES\n\n\'\n\nMOTORDRIVEN\nVALVE-\n\nVALVE\n\n-\n\nOVERFLOW\n\n*--SOMP\n\nTANK\n\n\'\xc2\xad\nSODIUM\n\nSUPPLY\n\nFLOW DIAGRAM FOR THE J.P.L.

M. Nerheim, Jet PropUlsion Laboratory\n\nEarly results obtained from MPD thrustors showed great promise for their\n\nuse as efficient, high specific impulse engines. However, as investigations\n\ncontinued at lower test pressures and smaller propellant feed rates, inconsisten\xc2\xad\ncies in the data, such as impossibly high thrust efficiencies, became apparent.\n\nThese inconsistencies are as yet unsolved, and-as a consequence the actual\n\ncapability of the NPD engine is seriously questioned, particularly at low feed\n\nrates. Although the level of effort devoted to detailed diagnostics is increas\xc2\xad\ning, the emphasis has been placed on the development of increased efficiency\n\nand lifetime with fuels compatible with long-term space missions. The theories\n\nthat have evolved are based largely on visual observations and the observed\n\ntrends of thrust, arc voltage and, to some extent, current paths in the exhaust\n\nas a function.of the operating conditions. Unfortunately, the interactions of\n\nthe electromagnetic and fluid dynamic forces are very complicated, and a con\xc2\xad\nsistant theory of the major thrust producing mechanism has not been formulated.\n\n\nOne of the areas that has not been adequately investigated is the inter\xc2\xad\nelectrode region where most of the ionization occurs.\' Detailed information on\n\nthe state of the plasma beford it becomes fully ionized and highly accelerated\n\n\nmay help explain the reasons for some of the observed behavior.\' For example,\n\nit is possible that rate processes should be considered in the design.\n\nOne of the objectives of the present investigation will be to measure\n\nthe electron density and temperature in the inter-electrode region by spectro\xc2\xad\nscopic methods. An existing MPD source will be modified to allow observation\n\nof this region. The initial experiments will use argon. Line broadening\n\nmeasuiements, with hydrogen or helium trace elements, will be used to determine\n\nelectron densities and standard spectroscopic methods will be used to determine\n\nthe temperature.\n\nOur past work (1\' 2 ) in plasma spectroscopy haA been largely concerned\n\nwith temperature determinations of the exhaust plume of ah MPD source operated\n\non argon. A 0.5 meter Ebert-mounted plane grating monochromator and a RCA\n\n7265 photomultiplier tube were used to make the measurements. The temperature\n\nwas determi ed from the relative intensities of fourteen argon ion lines for\n\nwhich Olsen (3 ) has published values of the transition probabilities. All\n\nmeasurements were taken near the exit of the plasma source where the intensi\xc2\xad\nties of the ion lines were high. Radial intensity profiles were obtained for\n\neach line by inverting the measured lateral profiles with Abel\'s transforma\xc2\xad\ntion. The temperature at a number of points along the plume radius was then\n\nfound by a least-mean-square fit of the data whicti are displayed in the usual\n\nmanner on a Boltzmann plot.\n\nThe relative-line-intensity method was used for the temperature deter\xc2\xad\nmination. It is less accurate than some other methods of spectroscopic\n\ntemperature measurements, but it was the only useable method for the plasma\n\nconditions that existed. The more reliable Larenz method is based on the\n\n\nprincipal that, at a fixed pressure, the intensity of every spectral line from\n\nan equilibrium plasma reaches a maximum at a certain temperature that is called\n\nthe normal temperature. Its use requires that the intensity of the line radia\xc2\xad\nhave a maximum at some off-axis position at which point the plasma is at the\n\nnormal temperature. The temperature profile of the NPD plume was found to be\n\nnearly\' constant at about 18,000OK. This is above the normal temperature of\n\nthe atomic line and below that of the ion lines. Another condition that pre\xc2\xad\ncluded the use of the.Larenz method was that the pressure across the exhaust\n\nwas not constant because of shock formations.\n\nA major factor that limits the accuracy of the relative-line-intensity\n\nmethod, in addition to the errors in the transition probabilities, is the\n\nsmall difference in the upper energy levels of the lines observed. For the\n\nion lines used in this work, the difference is about 2 eV. If the relative\n\nintensities of both the atom line and the ion line could be compared, the\n\nenergy level difference would be increased to about 8 eV and the uncertainty\n\nin the temperature correspondingly decreased. The use of both species re\xc2\xad\nquires that atom and ion concentrations be related through equilibrium re\xc2\xad\nlationships. The range of conditions at which both species radiate with\n\nsufficient intensity for accurate measurement is limited. The atom lines in\n\nthe NPD exhaust are very weak.\n\nRecent published analysis (4 ) of the maximum errors that can occur, if\n\nonly two lines are used, have shown that it is possible for the accuracy to\n\nbe so poor that the method would be worthless. However, if a large number of\n\nlines are used, and if the errors in the relative values of the published\n\ntrahsition probabilities are randomly distributed the errors will be much\n\nsmaller than those estimated for the two-line method. A standard calculation,\n\nthat is based on the least-mean-square fit of the data and relates an error to\n\nthe amount of data scatter, has been used in this work to obtain an estimated\n\nerror of approximately 7/ on the jet centerline.\n\nThe correlation between the spectroscopically measured excitation tem\xc2\xad\nperature and the electron temperature is not generally known if the plasma\n\ndeparts from local thermal equilibrium (LTE). The two temperatures are identi\xc2\xad\ncal if the population levels of the excited states are controlled by collisions\n\nwith electrons that have a Maxwellian velocity distribution. How well these\n\nconditions are fulfilled as the plasma departs from LTE is not well known.\n\nPart of the planned work will be to obtain an experimental correlation between\n\nthe excitation temperature and the electron temperature as a function of the\n\narc operation conditions by comparing the spectroscopic measurements with\n\n\'Langmuir probe measurements. The MPD source has been operated from low pres\xc2\xad\nsures (- 100 micron) up to atmospheric pressure; therefore, it will be possible\n\nto examine the plasma in regimes where LTE may reasonably be expected to exist\n\nand where both the atom and ion line can be measured. The relation between\n\nthe radiation from the two species will be investigated and compared to the\n\nprobe results as a function of the ambient pressure and total enthalpy. Be\xc2\xad\ncause of the large amount of data that must be handled in performing the\n\nAbel inversion for each line, some effort will be devoted to recording the\n\ndata in digital form.\n\n\n95\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \t\nKelly, A.

Russell, Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n\nA study has been initiated at JEL to determine the feasibility of operat\xc2\xad\ning a nonequilibrium ND generator utilizing inert gases without the addition\n\nof metalic vapor seeding. Both theoretical and experimental work are included\n\nin the program.\n\nNormally, in the theoretical treatment of nonequilibrium generators, it\nis assumed that a steady state has been attained where electron elastic energy\nlosses and possibly radiative losses are exactly balanced by the energy addi\xc2\xad\ntion from the magnetically induced electric field, Usually, it is assumed that\nthe Saha equation is valid and that the electron density is in equilibrium with\nthe free electron temperature. The transient problem of how this energy balance\nis established, or whether it can be established at all, has received relatively\nlittle attention. Comparisons of inert gases and inert gas mixtures with\nalkali-metal seeded inert gases to determine optimum working fluids for non\xc2\xad\nequilibrium generators should include the complete transient flow problem for\nboth cases. Here, solutions are obtained only for pure inert gases and inert\ngas mixtures to determine the feasibility of achieving nonequilibrium opera\xc2\xad\ntion, without the addition of metalic vapors, where the degree of ionization\nat the generator entrance is extremely small.\nA computer program has been generated to determine nonequilibrium MHD\n\ngenerator plasma properties considering simultaneously the electron heating,\n\nionization and subsequent energy extraction from the plasma. The generalized\n\nmacroscopic equations describing a quasi-one-dimensional flow of a compressible\n\nmulti-component plasma with different. species temperatures are solved utilizing\n\nthe transport theory of Zhadanov I to obtain a generalized Ohm\'s law and elec\xc2\xad\ntron energy equation. In addition to the tensor electrical conductivity, radia\xc2\xad\ntion, electron thermal conductivity, thermal-electric effects, and finite elec\xc2\xad\ntron ionization and recombination rates are included in the analysis. A three\n\nlevel hydrogen-like model is used to calculate the rate of change of the popula\xc2\xad\ntion of the first excited state, the free electron density, and the radiation\n\nassociated with the ionization process, It is shown that continuum radiation\n\nis always negligible compared with the elastic energy losses from the electron\n\ngas and, therefore, can be neglected in the electron energy equation. The\n\nionizing radiation is not always negligible, and particularly at the end of\n\nthe ionization period when excited state populations are relatively large, the\n\nradiation must be included in the electron energy equation,\n\nConstant pressure and variable area solutions can be obtained from the\n\ncomputer program. Pure argon, pure xenon and argon-xenon and helium-xenon\n\nmixtures have been studied as working fluids. For the case of the supersonic\n\ngenerator, the expansion in a supersonic nozzle is also analyzed with a compu\xc2\xad\nter to determine the entrance conditions of the generator--principally the\n\ndegree of ionization and nozzle induced electron temperature elevation.\n\nThe principle results of- the computer program obtained thus far are the\n\nfollowing:\n\n\n97\n1. Generator operation can be attained utilizing inert gases and inert\n\n-gas mixtures without metatic-vapor seeding at stagnation temperatures\n\nattained in nuclear re&tors.\n\n2. \tThe electron temperature elevation is achieved before appreciable\xc2\xad\nionization conences. Thus, the flow consists of three approximately\n\nseparate regions--an entrance region where only the electron tempera\xc2\xad\nture changes, an ionization region where the electron-density\n\nincreases at an elevated electron temperature, and an energy\n\nextraction region where all the plasma variables can change rapidly\n\nalong the duct length.\n\n\n3. \t Saha equilibrium at the electron temperature is rarely achieved.\nGenerally, adjacent to the generator entrance the electron density\nappreciably lags the electron temperature. After the start of\nappreciable energy extraction and a subsequent decrease in the\nplasma velocity, electron recombination is not fast enough to\nmaintain equilibrium, so that the electron density and electrical\nconductivity tend to remain elevated as the electron temperature\ndecreases.\n4. \t\nThe generator length is determined almost exclusively by the rate\n\nof ionization of the gas with the lower ionization potential in a\n\ngas mixture, This length may be increased appreciably by radiative\n\ndepopulation of excited states at low electron densities.\n\n5. \t\nBecause the energy necessary for ionization is supplied by the\n\nelectron gas the inelastic losses in the electron energy balance\n\ncan cause the electron temperature to be reduced appreciably below\n\nthe value determined by elastic collisional losses, thereby reducing\n\nthe ionization rate and increasing the generator length. This\n\nreduction in the ionization rate fixes an upper bound for a given\n\nHall parameter on the atom density and gas pressure which, if\n\nexceeded, will result in excessive generator lengths. For example,\n\nin a 2% xenon-98 % helium mixture, f6r atom densities greater than\n\nabout 1018cm\'3 , the generator length would exceed ten meters.\n\nAn experimental MlD\ngenerator is now under construction and should be\n\ncompleted in a few months. The generator is designed to operate in the super\xc2\xad\nsonic range at constant pressure. Other types of operation are possible, but\n\noperation at constant pressure may minimize the possibility of shock waves\n\nforming in the flow in regions of rapid energy extraction . Also, there is\n\nsome experimental evidence obtained with cross-field accelerators indicating\n\n_that electrode and insulator reliability can be attained much more readily in\n\n.\n\nfree jets than with flows constricted in a duct 3\n\nThe test apparatus consists of a plasma heater powered by three NFD\n\narcs, an uncooled tantalum supersonic nozzle, and a constant pressure uncooled\n\ntest section employing tungsten segmented electrodes. The generator test \n\n2\nsection is about 50 cm in length and has a cross sectional area of about 16 cm\n\ndepending on the test section Mach number. There are 80 pairs of tungsten wire\n\nelectrodes with an electrode spacing of 0.76 cm.\n\nAlthough most of the inert gases and inert gas mixtures can be used\n\nsucces\'sfully as working fluids over a wide range of generator sizes,\n\n\n98\nconsideration of dimensional and vacuumpump restrictions in this experiment\n\nindicate that the helium-xenon mixture appears to be the best working fluid.\n\nThe helium-xenon mixture is particularly attractive because the induced\n\ngenerator voltage can be made large compared to the boundary layer and electrode\n\nsheath voltage.\n\nInitially, attention will be focused on the measurement of the degree of\n\nelectron temperature and density elevation along the generator duct length.\n\nElectron temperatures and densities Villibe measured with Langmuir probes,\n\nmicrowave diagnostics, and spectroscopic techniques. Use of both a 24 GHz and\n\n90.9 GHz microwe system will make it possible to measure electron densities\n\n.\ncm "3\n The actual ringe of electron densities\nC ne < 10\nin the range 10\n1015 cmr\nexpected in the experiment is l09 < ne\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \tZhadanov, V.

The first is to under\xc2\xad\nstand the physical properties of plasmas existing in small gaps of the\norder of 1/1000 inch, between electron- and ion-emitting electrodes.\nThe second goal is to utilize such understanding in improving the per\xc2\xad\nformance of existing thermionic-energy converters by reducing plasma\nlosses.\n\nIn order to attain such goals, we have investigated, during the\n\npast two years, (1) low-frequency oscillations in cesium diodes, and\n\n(2) charge transport in neutral and non-neutral plasmas. The experi\xc2\xad\nmental phase of task (1) was completed and our current efforts are\n\ndirected toward task (2). The study of charge transport is intended\n\nto improve our understanding of the current conduction through plasmas,\n\nthe plasma formation, and the plasma-sheath interactions. This work\n\nwill be extended to a plasma immersed in an external magnetic field.\n\nA mathematical formulation of charge transport has been completed for\n\nan electrically neutral plasma as well as for a non-neutral plasma.\n\nSubsequently, the results will be presented at this meeting.\n\nOur research group also works very closely with the Power Sources\n\nSection at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Consequently, the properties\n\nof plasmas in prototype thermionic-energy converters can be obtained as\n\nrequired.\nLow-Frequency Oscillations in Cesium Diodes\n\nThe initial intent of this work was to investigate the possibil\xc2\xad\nities of generating and sustaining magnetosonic oscillations of large\namplitude in thermionic diodes. However, the scope of this work was re\xc2\xad\nduced to the study of the natural oscillations occurring in cylindrical\ncesium diodes without the application of an external magnetic field.\nSeveral cesium diodes having cylindrical geometry were fabricated\n\nin glass envelopes. The results obtained from these diodes showed that\n\nthe oscillations occurred in the plateau region of the volt-ampere\n\n\n100\n\n\ncurves when the diodes were operated in an unignited mode with the\n.ratio of emitter temperature to cesium reservoir temperature nearly\nequal to, or slightly larger than, the value required for neutral\nemission. Although the amplitude of the oscillations depended on the\ncircuit repistance in series with the diode, it reached a character\xc2\xad\nistic value when this resistance was reduced below a threshold value\n\nwhich was of the order of an ohm. This characteristic amplitude\n\n(peak-to-peak) may be as large as the dc current through the diode.\n\nThe peak value of this oscillation current closely followed the\n\ntheoretically expected saturation current available from the emitter,\n\nwhereas the minimum value was substantially smaller. A block diagram\n\nof the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. This setup enabled us\n\nto make measurements of the volt-ampere curves, the waveforms, and the\n\nfrequency of oscillation under various operating conditions of a diode.\n\nThe results are presented in Fig. 2. The period of oscillation (the\n\nreciprocal of frequency) was proportional to the pressure and was\n\napproximately proportional to the interelectrode distance.\n\nIt was concluded that the oscillations occurring in cesium diodes\n\noperating in an unignited mode are the result of space-charge oscil\xc2\xad\nlations about the average space-charge density which yields neutral.\n\nemission.\nCharge Transport in\n\nPlasmas\n\nTheoretical studies of charge transport in plasmas were initiated\nas part of our efforts in finding means for reducing plasma losses in\n\nthermionic-energy converters. Our future effort will be directed\n\ntoward utilizing a magnetic field in increasing the efficiency of\n\nionization in thermionic diodes.\n\nThe spatial distribution of charge particles was calculated for\nan electrically neutral plasma, assuming that the plasma is strictly\nneutral and that the sourceless and sinkless condition holds only for\nthe net current density. The charge density was found to be a super\xc2\xad\nposition of two parts; one was invariant in the space coordinate, and\nthe other varied exponentially with distance. The constant part\ndescribed the netcurrent through the plasma, and the exponential part\nfollowed the Boltzmann distribution. The result obtained above for a\nnon-zero electric-field condition also included a solution for the\n"ero-field condition as a limiting case. The solution in the latter\ncase had a linear dependence on the space coordinate. Furthermore,\nsuch quantities as the characteristic length, the time constant, and\nthe generation or the recombination rate were calculated. They are\nsummarized in Figs 3 and 4.\nAn analysis of charge distribution in a non-neutral plasma was\n\nalso made. A system of equations was reduced in such a way that the\n\n\n101\n\nelectron density and the excess charge density (the difference between\n\nthe positive and the negative charge) could be determined independently\n\nof each other. Our future \'work will be to integrate these solutions\n\nwith a solution for the plasma sheath adjacent to the electron- and\n\nion-emitting electrodes so that the external volt-ampere characteristic\nof a cesium diode can be obtained.\nAn in-house design-of a test vehicle having a metal-ceramic struc\xc2\xad\nture has been completed and its fabrication is in progress. This diode\nwill be used in the experimental phase of our research on charge\ntransport.\n\nOVEN\nOPTICALEMITTER\nMICROI\nPYROMETER\n\nFILAMENT\nTRANSFORMER.\n60 cps\n1-+\n\nCOLLECTOR\nL\n\nEXPERIMENTAL I +\n_j\n_DIODE\nTHERMOCOUPLE\n\nFIG. i..,\n\nSCOPE\n-AXIS\n\nPULSE\nGENERATOR\n\nSCOPE\nSCOPE\nY-AXIS\nINTENSITY\nAND\nMODULATOR\nWAVE ANALYZER\n\nSCHEMATIC DIAGRAM OF MEASURING CIRCUIT\nH\n0\n\n103\n\nAMPLITUDE -OFOSCILLATION\nW-Ta SMALL DIODE\n\nFIG. 2.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nS.\n\n/\n\nIS.\n\n10-I\n\n\'"4740K\n\nz\nILI\n\n/,\n\n446\xc2\xb0K\n\n_\n-\n\nZ\n\nz\nLI0\n\n420\xc2\xb0K\\\xc2\xad\n\n-3\ni0 -\n\n4000 K\n10 4\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nIO00/7=, \xc2\xb0K\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n104\n\nr.\n6+\n\n-rE -\n\n.-\xc2\xad\nn-\n\n1\n\n( 2)\n\nf\n\noR\n\n(I)\n/4,l ==V\n\n-n+- V\n\n+ =\n\nV+d\n\n))\n\n(2)\n\n= Vt14ln\n_\n\nh\n\nx\n\nZv-v F\n\nr\n\n*=)-q\nn t,+\n\n(1(3\n-\n\n-G,_\n\n(15)\n\n(5)\n\n-0\n\nv.\n\nv ,(+ - )=or\'=\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nv "=\n\no n \xc2\xad\n-\xc2\xad\n\nE = E\nE,\n\nQ\'+ +\n\n_) o(\n\n)\n\n(6)\n\n-\n\n- (D\xe2\x80\xa2 - .,A~2\n\nSOLUTION: CASE (l), E\n\n5\n\nO, D+\n7=\n\n-/\n\n0\n\n(7\n\nSOLUTION:\nCASE (2), Ex =OL=o\n\nOD\n\nn,0 +4n\n0\n\nn7jj+fl j\n\nx\n\n-116)\n\nD -DI,\n,a+ ++ Ex\n/z\n\nd~\n\nIOo)o,-J\no+\n\n++\n.\nt ,/ +D 4.+ -D\xc2\xad\nA bL \xc2\xad / _\nt,\n\n0)\n\nv.r C+:V.r o\n\n(pI\n\nFig. 3.

S. Wu, Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n\nSeveral plasma problems have been studied recently\n\nbased on kinetic theory. These problems are concerned\n\nwith plasma transport phenomena and stability. The first\n\nproblem is on temperature relaxation. We found that\n\nelectron-ion collisions, which in previous analyses have\n\nbeen neglected by many authors, can be very important in\n\nthe relaxation of anisotropic temperature distribution.\nOur analysis also takes account of the effect of particle\xc2\xad\nwave interaction in the collision integral.\n\nThe second problem is the calculation of high-frequency\n\nconductivity of a two-temperature plasma. It is found that\n\nthe incoherent ion waves can give rise to significant en\xc2\xad\nhancement of the resistivity.\n\nThe third problem is concerned with the electromagnetic\n\ninstability of a plasma in the absence of applied magnetic\n\nfield. It is found that anisotropic ion distribution may\n\nresult in unstable transverse waves. The instability is of\n\nan aperiodic nature.\n\n\nGPO 907067\n\n'
