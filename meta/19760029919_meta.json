This baseline Space Tug is a nominal 15-ft diameter, 30-ft long, LOX/LH2 stage with a main propellant capacity of about 50,000 lbs. Once deployed  from the Space Shuttle in orbit, it is designed to automatically deliver spacecraft to a predetermined position and velocity and/or rendezvous and dock with prepositioned spacecraft for servicing or retrieval. The Tug would normally be returned to the vicinity of the Shuttle  Orbiter, with or without spacecraft, to be retrieved and returned to  earth in the Shuttle. Design characteristics, performance requirements, projected activities, and subsystems features are described.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19760029919, "endDate": "1975-08-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AAS, AIAA, IEEE, ORSA, and IMS,"}}, "meetingId": "587153e3055e49b89065764cdb82c9e0", "id": "b7bb61e5263248e88fbbbfaddf55f080"}], "name": "Meeting on Space Shuttle Missions of the 80''s", "location": "Denver, CO", "id": "587153e3055e49b89065764cdb82c9e0", "startDate": "1975-08-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760029919, "id": "4b272f3ade61417b9fea2ec52a4be181", "publicationDate": "1975-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
