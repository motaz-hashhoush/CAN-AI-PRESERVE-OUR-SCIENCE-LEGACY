The lineaments\nare expressed topographically as alignments of linear valleys, elongate\nridges, breaks in slope or combinations of these. The lineaments are\ntypically less than 1 km wide, and several can be traced in the ERTS-1\nimagery for over 30 km. Natural outcrop exposures along them are\ncharacteristically poor.\nTwo lineaments were found to align with foliated metamorphic roof\npendants and screens within granitic country rocks. Along other\nlineaments, the most consistent correlations were found to be alignments of diabase dikes of Cretaceous age, and younger cataclastic shear\nzones and minor faults. Deep roadcut exposures in several key areas\nsuggest that dikes and shear zones have controlled in-place weathering\nand erosion along the lineament trends. No evidence was found for\nhydrothermal alteration or Recent faulting.\nThe location of several Pliocene and Pleistocene volcanic centers at or\nnear lineament intersections suggests that the lineaments may represent\nzones of crustal weakness which have provided conduits for rising\nmagma.\nIntroduction:\nERTS-1 MSS imagery over the southern Sierra Nevada Range of eastern California has\nrevealed a pattern of straight, narrow lineaments, some of which can be traced in\nthe imagery for over 30 kilometers. Most of these features have not been mapped\npreviously. Geologic reconnaissance along several of the lineaments was conducted by\nthe authors in order to identify their geologic origins and significance.\nThe area of study is located on the Boreal Plateau (Webb, 1946) in parts of Tulare and\nInyo Counties (Index Map, figure 2). Topographic relief on this portion of the plateau\nis moderate, with elevations ranging from 2, 000 to 3, 000 meters. Vegetation cover is\nmoderate to extensive. Meadows and meandering stream valleys support lush growth\n\n- j--\n\nof grass, and the higher elevations are covered by chaparell and stands of pine, fir,\nand aspen trees.\nThe dominant rock types in the study area are plutonic, ranging in composition from\nquartz diorite to granite. In some areas, dike swarms are abundant. These dikes are\npredominately fine-grained diabase and porphyritic gabbro, although rhyolites, aplites\nand pegmatites are found locally (Miller and Webb, 1940).\nLarge, irregular roof pendants of foliated metamorphic rock are mapped in many parts\nof the study area (Miller and Webb, 1940; Matthews and Burnett, 1966; Smith, 1965).\nSmall pendants and screens of similar metamorphic rock are also widespread,\nalthough most of these do not appear at the scale of existing geologic maps.\nERTS-1 MSS Imagery:\nFigure 1 shows an enlarged portion of ERTS-1 MSS frame #1162-18011, Band 5. A\ncorresponding topographic map showing the positions of lineaments interpreted from\nthe imagery is illustrated in Figure 2.\nERTS-1 scenes recorded over a 12-month period were studied in this investigation.\nSeasonal variation of sun angle and snow cover were found to change the expression of\nsome lineaments; however, each of the lineaments shown in Figures 1 and 2 were\nvisible throughout the seasonal span. Seasonal variation of vegetation was not observed\nto affect expression of the lineaments.\nERTS-1 MSS frames having low to moderate cloud coverage are as follows:\n15 September 1972\n21 October 1972\n14 December 1972\n1 January 1973\n12 June 1973\n30 June 1973\n\nFrame #1054-18003\n1090-18010\n1144-18012\n1162-18011\n1324-18011\n1324-18010\n\nThe ERTS-1 MSS imagery was studied with a Spectral Data Corporation model 61\nadditive color viewer to determine optimum band/filter combinations and color balance\nfor enhancement of geologic detail. High resolution color composites (MacGalliard and\nLiggett, 1973) were produced at the scale of 1:500, 000 for detailed analysis and\ninterpretation. The positions of key structural anomalies observed in this imagery\nwere transferred to 1:250, 000 and 1:62, 500 scale topographic quadrangles to facilitate\nfield reconnaissance.\nLineaments:\nThe lineaments are expressed topographically as alignments of linear valleys, elongate\nridges, breaks in slope or combinations of these. Several lineaments can be traced in\n\n-2-\n\nthe ERTS-1 imagery for over 30 km, and are typically less than 1 km wide.\nThe dominant trend of the lineaments in the area is slightly east of north. This system\nis crossed by less numerous lineaments which strike toward the northeast as shown in\nFigures 1 and 2. The Kern Canyon Fault Zone (Webb, 1955) is the only major structural feature mapped in the area of study. Only small portions of three other lineaments\nhave been previously mapped as faults (see Smith, 1965; Matthews and Burnett, 1966).\nIn a structural reconnaissance of the southern Sierra Nevada, Mayo (1947) recognized\nseveral pervasive structural patterns which he attributed to such phenomena as\nigneous "flow structure" and post batholithic "joint swarms" and "fissures". The\norientation of these features closely parallel the three directional trends apparent in\nFigures 1 and 2.\nDuring field reconnaissance, two lineaments were found to align with the foliation or\ncompositional layering of metamorphic rocks. Lineament Y-Y shown in Figure 2 is\nlocated within a large roof pendant in which the foliation and layering parallels the\nwest-northwest strike of the lineament. Similar exposures along lineament X-X\nreveal a thin, elongate screen of metamorphic rock in which the foliation and compositional layering align with the lineament. No faulting was recognized along the traces\nof these lineaments, and their topographic expression as elongate ridges and valleys\nappears to have been controlled by preferential weathering and erosion of the foliated\nrock.\nThe north-south striking lineaments are found\nsion in natural outcrop exposures. Within the\nvaried plutonic country rocks and are confined\noutcroppings are found even where lineaments\n\nto have characteristically vague expresareas studied, these lineaments cross\nto valleys or breaks in slope. Sparse\ncross topographic saddles.\n\nFor these reasons, close study was made of available exposures. Where feasible,\nmeasurements.were made of such features as igneous foliation, cataclastic foliation,\nmetamorphic foliation or compositional layering, dikes, shear zones, slickensides,\nepidotized joints, and the dominant trends of these features inferred within each\noutcrop area in the field.\nDikes:\nThe dikes indicated in Figure 3 are hornblende diabase, similar in composition and\ntexture throughout the study area. The dikes generally range in width from 0. 5 to 5. 0 m\nand are nearly vertical in dip. In areas of good exposure along lineaments, the dikes\nare spaced at intervals of less than 2 m. Dikes within a swarm typically strike within\n100 of each other, although frequently two trends intersecting at a high angle are found\nwithin a local area. This bimodal pattern is apparent in the orientation diagrams of\nFigure 3.\n\n-3-\n\nThe mafic dikes cut both plutonic and metamorphic country rocks, and are themselves\ncut only rarely by rhyolite dikes. A K-Ar age date from a north 200 east-striking\ndike at Station C in Figure 3 (specimen 73L31) yielded an apparent mid-Cretaceous\nage of 105 \xc2\xb1 5 m.y.\nStructures:\nStructural features included in the trend diagrams of Figure 3 include cataclastic\nfoliation, slickensided joints and faults. These structures cut across the diabase\ndikes and are, therefore, younger. Epidotized joints or fractures lacking evidence of\nmovement were not included in the diagrams.\nShears cutting the plutonic country rocks typically appear as planes or zones 1 to 2 cm\nwide in which the granitic texture of the host is cataclastically foliated. Where well\nexposed, these planes are found to be subparallel in strike, nearly vertical in dip,\nand spaced at intervals of a few centimeters to about 1 m.\nWithin the shear zones, movement is indicated by slickensides, many with subhorizontal plunges. Slickensides are best preserved on joints or shears which have\nbeen epidotized. As shown in the trend diagrams of Figure 3, the strike of shears,\njoints and fault planes, like the diabase dikes is frequently bimodal.\nDiscussion:\nThe continuity of dike swarms and cataclastic shearing along the entire lengths of the\nlineaments is not documented because of the characteristically poor exposures.\nHowever, in several key areas where roadcuts have exposed the deeply weathered\ngranitic rocks along lineaments, slickensided joints and diabase dikes are apparent\nin far greater abundance than in the adjacent natural outcrop exposures. Examples of\nthis are visible in roadcuts at Station F shown in Figure 3. This selective exposure\nis believed to be the result of lithologic and structural control of in-place weathering\nand erosion.\nThe glassy groundmass, mafic mineralogy and closely spaced jointing of the diabase\ndikes make them prone to rapid chemical and mechanical weathering. As a result,\nthe positions of former dikes are frequently expressed in outcrops as linear debrisfilled depressions. Similar expression is observed in the selective weathering of\ngranitic rocks along shear zones or closely spaced joints, where large surface areas are\nexposed to chemical and mechanical weathering processes (Thornbury, 1954). These\nprocesses favor preservation of natural outcrop exposures which have the fewest shear\nzones, faults or dikes.\nAt the reconnaissance scale of this study, no direct evidence was found supporting\nmajor displacement of lithologic units across the lineaments. Although some faulting\nand shearing may be Recent in age, the topographic expression of the lineaments is\ndue to selective weathering and erosion, and not primary topographic displacement.\n\n-4-\n\nMayo (1947) suggested possible structural control of several late Tertiary and\nQuaternary volcanic centers in the area of this report. These volcanic centers appear\nto be located at or near the intersection of the lineament systems shown in Figure 2.\nHowever, little field evidence was found to confirm structural control. Radiometric\nages from a basalt field along the Kern River south of Angora Mountain indicate a late\nPliocene age (Matthews and Burnett, 1966). Olivine basalt cinder cones and flows\nalong Golden Trout Creek east of the Kern River are believed to be of Quaternary or\nRecent age (Webb, 1950).\nMonache and Templeton Mountains are large volcanic domes composed of aphanitic\nlatite (Webb, 1950) and considered to be of probable late Tertiary or Quaternary age.\nPossible structural control of the Monache Mountain dome is suggested by the existence\nof numerous felsic dikes intruded along fractures adjacent to older diabase dikes in\nexposures surrounding Monache Meadows.\nConclusions:\nAt regional scale, the lineament systems discussed in this report, appear to control\nmuch of the topography in the southern Sierra Nevada. The origin of these features is\nuncertain. Their apparent correlations with faulting, jointing, dike swarms and volcanic\ncenters suggest that they may represent steeply-dipping zones of crustal weakness\nwithin the Sierra Nevada Batholith. These zones appear to have existed at the time of\nintrusion of the mid Cretaceous diabase dikes, and may have been reactivated during\nTertiary and Quaternary orogenic and volcanic events.\nIt is hoped that future, detailed studies will help determine the age, precise origins and\ngeological implications of these features.\nAlthough the lineaments are perhaps the largest post-batholithic structural features in\nthe southern Sierra Nevada, they have not been generally recognized on the basis of\nprevious geologic mapping. The ERTS-1 MSS data has proved to be an effective tool\nfor recognition of these large-scale structural anomalies, and for guiding reconnaissance\nin the field.\n\n-5-\n\nFigure 1: Enlarged portion of ERTS-1 MSS frame #1162-18011 Band 5 over the\nsouthern Sierra Nevada, California.
