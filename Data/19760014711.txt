INTRODUCTION\nThere are several ways of obtaining the geoid undulation. One is through a\nsatellite-derived geoid, which is limited to long-wavelength components owing to the\ninherent inaccuracies of satellite tracking. Another is the gravimetric geoid, computed by applying Stokes formula to surface-gravity data. This method, however,\nrequires gravity values covering the whole surface of the earth, and such dense\ncoverage is currently difficult to obtain.\nWhen a detailed and relative geoid is to be determined in a restricted area and\nwhen there are sufficient data in that area, the astrogeodetic geoid is practical to\nobtain, in that it does not need worldwide data. Even though observations of the\ndeflection of the vertical are time-consuming, the astrogeodetic geoid is valuable\nbecause interpolation is possible if suitable amounts of vertical-deflection observations exist.\n\nThis work was supported in part by Grant NGR 09-015-002 from the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.\ntVisiting Scientist, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, October 1974 through\nOctober 1975.

ASTROGEODETIC GEOID\n\nThe difference in geoid height between astrogeodetic stations is computed from\nHelmert\'s formula\n\n.\t\n\ni+1\n\t\nNi+1-Ni=- QcosA+71sinA)ds\ni\n\nI\n\n(1)\n\nwhere N i is the geoid height of the ith station; t and 77 are the vertical-deflection\ncomponents in the meridian and prime vertical, respectively; and A is the azimuth\nof the direction of the ith station to the (i + 1)th station.\nThe current method of interpolating the deflection of the vertical needs dense\ngravity measurements around the astrogeodetic stations. Another possibility of\ninterpolation, when the vertical-deflection stations are sufficiently dense, uses leastsquares estimation (Heiskanen and Moritz, 1967). Least-squares methods also\nprovide an estimate of accuracy. The number of vertical-deflection observations\nthat have been made in Japan since 1886 is more than 450. This distribution is sufficiently dense for most areas in Japan.\nTo find the accuracy of an estimate of the deflection, let the vector V be\nV\n\n=(D\n\nAssuming that the vertical deflection at point p, V p , can be estimated by the linear\ncombination of observed values, V i , we can write\n\nV\n\np=E\n\na pi Vi\n\n,\t\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nMWEDING PAGE BLAM NOT FMMID\n\n3\n\n\t\n\nwhere api are scalar coefficients. This means we can neglect the correlation between\nand n.

COVARIANCE FUNCTION GAB\nThe observed deflection of the vertical includes both the systematic datum shift\nand the deflection included in the global geoid. To obtain the detailed local geoid by\nmeam of a covariance function, these two components should be eliminated.\nFor the datum shift, we introduce the translation values Ax, Ay, and oz of the\ngeodetic datum, determined by satellite tracking. According to the 1973 Smithsonian\nStandard Earth (III) (SE III) (Gaposchkin, 1973, 15 \' 4), these values for the Tokyo\ndatum arc\nAx = -136 m\n4,=+521m\n\n\t\n(9)\n\ni1z = +681 m\nBy adding these values to the station coordinates on the Tokyo datum and neglecting\nthe geoid height and possible datum rotation, the new three-dimensional geocentric\ncoordinates become\n\nx\'=(N+h)cos^cosX+Ax\nyl= (N+h)cososinX+Ay\n2\nz\' _[(ha) N + h sin o + 4z\nwhere 0 and a are on the Tokyo datum and h is the mean-sea-level height; N is given\nby\nN=\t\n\na\n\n2\n\n(a2 cos2 0 + b 2 sin 2 0) 1 2\n\nb=all-f) ,\na= 6377397.2 m\n\nf = 1/299.1528\n\npRCIDIINQ PAGE &AM \t\n\n:s\n\n7\n\nin which a and f are the parameters of the reference ellipsoid of the Tokyo datum.\nThe coordinates x\', y\', and z\' can be converted to the geocentric q\', V, h\' system\nthroug `.he inverse transformation of\nX 1 = (N\' + h\') cogs ^\' cos a\' ,\nY \'= (N\'+ h\') cos ^\' sin A\'\n\n2\n\nZ? = [(h N\' + h\'] sin\n,J\na)\nb\' = a\' (1 - f\')\na,2\n\nN\' =\n\n(a 12 coo 2^\' + b\'2 sin2 ^, ) 1 2\n\nfor which the ellipsoid parameters\na\'= 6378140 m\n\nfl = 1/298.256\nare those of the best-fitting ellipsoid of the SE III solution.

When the anomaly correlation distance is small compared to the\nradius of the earth and when the anomaly is statistically homogeneous, the following\nrelation exists between the gravity-anomaly correlation and the vertical-deflection\ncorrelation (Shaw, Paul, and lienricson, 1969; Jordan, 1972):\n1\nC s + C= \t Cgg\ng\t 2\n0\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nBull--tin of the Geographical Survey Institute, Japan, vol.

Adding the old data\n(Torso, 1949) brings to 450 the total number of vertical-deflection stations used to\ncalculate the local geoid for Japan, excluding the old data from the Hokkaido area.\n\nPRWEDI NG PAGE BLANK NOW\n\nFLVA3\t\n\n15\n\nIn the Hokkaido area, data before 1947 were not used, because of inconsistencies\nbetween the old and the new. Relative weights were not taken into consideration\nbecause of the uncertain accuracy of the old data, even though the old data might\ninclude large errors. The purpose of this paper, however, is to examine the efficiency of the least-squares estimation method in interpolating vertical deflections.\n\n16\n\n\t\n\nI\t\n\n^\n\n5. COMPARISON OF INTERPOLATION METHODS\nThe current method of interpolating vertical deflections is a gravimetric one, in\nwhich dense gravity observations around astrogeodetic stations are required. A test\nof gravimetric interpolation was carried out by Ono (1974) in a restricted area in Japan,\nand geoid-height (quasi-geoid-height) differences were calculated between astrogeodetic stations. Interpolations by means of least-squares estimation were also\nmade along the same route, shown in Figure 4, and the results are presented in\nFigure 5. The geoid-height differences were transformed to those referred to the\nbest-fitting ellipsoid of SE M. The maximum difference in geoid height due to different interpolation methods is 44 cm, and at the farthest point, numbered 263, the\ndifference is 16 em. These results would indicate that the least-squares estimation\nmethod is one of the most effective ways to interpolate vertical deflections. With this\nmethod, we can easily calculate the relative geoid height, without additional data,\nover that area of Japan that is densely covered with astrogeodetic stations.\n14000/\n+\t\n\n+ 38030\'\n1\n\n+\t\nQ 263\t\n268\n\nJAPAN V267\n\n+ fi 266\t\n\n-4 37\xc2\xb0 20\'\n\n60\n\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\n48\n\n12660 km\n+ 36 0 0\' N\n141\xc2\xb0 0\' E\n\n262 +\t\n\nFigure 4.

The geoid referred to\nthe reference ellipsoid of the Tokyo datum can also be obtained through transformation by using translation values from equation (9) and ellipsoid parameters. This\ntype of geoid is shown in Figure 11. Fisher (1960) published the same kind of astrogeodetic geoid for all of Japan except for Hokkaido and the southern part of Kyushu.\nThe geoid-height differences between hers and Figure 11 are as much as 3 m in some\nareas.\n\n21\n\na\n\na^\n\n;w\nM\n\n7\n\nFigure 8.

COMPARISON OF STATION COORDINATES\n\nI\n\nThe geoid-height differences referred to the SE III best-fitting ellipsoid,\na= 6378140 m, f = 1/298.256, were compared with solutions derive.\' from SE III and\nfrom doppler observations (Anderle, 1974). The results are presented in Table 2.\nLocations of the satellite-tracking stations are shown in Figure 12.\nTable 2.

The large discrepancy between the\n_\t\n\nSE III and the astrogeodetic-geoid solutions seems to arise partly from the adopted\ngeoid height (-19 m) of Kanoya on the Tokyo datum in SE III, in contrast to the -12 m\ndetermined in the astrogeodetic geoid.\n\nPkiMING PAGE BLANK NOT M MM\n27\n\nSASE\n30-\n\n. ,22.8 \xe2\x80\xa2 ^\n\n200k m\n\nFigure 12.

CONCLUSIONS\nThe efficiency of the least-squares estimation method in interpolating deflections\nof the vertical has been shown. This method requires only vertical-deflection data.\nWhen these data are dense enough \xe2\x80\x94 roughly speaking, more than 30 in a 2 \xc2\xb0 X 2\xc2\xb0\narea \xe2\x80\x94 this method is one of the most effective ways of calculating geoid undulation.\nThe correlation distance of the local anomaly field in Japan is 55 km, and the\nroot-mean-square value of the deflection of the vertical of the local anomaly field\nis 111.11.\nGood agreement is found in the comparison of doppler results with the geoid\nobtained here.\n\n29\n\nf\n\n9.
