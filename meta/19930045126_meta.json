It is important therefore that the robot be used to reach desired locations efficiently and reliably. A mobile robot whose environment extends significantly beyond its sensory horizon must maintain a representation of the environment, a map, in order to attain these efficiency and reliability requirements. We believe that qualitative mapping methods provide useful and robust representation schemes and that such maps may be used to direct the actions of a reactively controlled robot. In this paper we describe our experience in employing qualitative maps to direct, through the selection of desired control strategies, a reactive-behavior based robot. This mapping capability represents the development of one aspect of a successful deliberative/reactive hybrid control architecture.", "title": "Using qualitative maps to direct reactive robots", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T00:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930045126, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bertin, Randolph"}, "organization": {"name": "Mitre Corp.", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "b3e154bcb1a44fcc83325c5e508f3a82"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930045126, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pendleton, Tom"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "ef4a4ad4f16747149bb66f04100799d2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930045126, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930045126, "publisher": "Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers", "id": "2ee61add4c8f42efb4b6eb7c15bd61bf", "publicationName": "In: Cooperative intelligent robotics in space III; Proceedings of the Meeting, Boston, MA, Nov. 16-18, 1992 (A93-29101 10-54)", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
