In some cases stars are surrounded by dust shells which consist of carbon refractories in the case of a carbon-rich environment, and metallic silicates of the kind that produced terrestrial planets in the case of oxygen-rich environments. A few of these infrared stars (called cygnids) exhibit a unique morphology that suggests the formation of a planetary stage in the evolution of a planetary nebula. Comets which are bright in the infrared and believed to be the remnants of the most primitive material in the solar nebula, are found to inject the astrophysical dust into our solar system together with asteroidal debris. Certain novae are also found to condense grains which are blown out in their shells after the explosion.", "title": "Star dust", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T05:20:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19770038820, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ney, E.
