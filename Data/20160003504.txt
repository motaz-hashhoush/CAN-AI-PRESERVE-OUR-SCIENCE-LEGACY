REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1\n\nPurpose and Scope\n\nThis requirements document is applicable to all batteries on crewed spacecraft, including vehicle,\npayload, and crew equipment batteries. It defines the specific provisions required to design a\nbattery that is safe for ground personnel and crew members to handle and/or operate during all\napplicable phases of crewed missions, safe for use in the enclosed environment of a crewed\nspace vehicle, and safe for use in launch vehicles, as well as in unpressurized spaces adjacent to\nthe habitable portion of a space vehicle. The required provisions encompass hazard controls,\ndesign evaluation, and verification. The extent of the hazard controls and verification required\ndepends on the applicability and credibility of the hazard to the specific battery design and\napplicable missions under review. Evaluation of the design and verification program results\nshall be completed prior to certification for flight and ground operations.\nThis requirements document is geared toward the designers of battery systems to be used in\ncrewed vehicles, crew equipment, crew suits, or batteries to be used in crewed vehicle systems\nand payloads (or experiments). This requirements document also applies to ground handling and\ntesting of flight batteries. Specific design and verification requirements for a battery are\ndependent upon the battery chemistry, capacity, complexity, charging, environment, and\napplication. The variety of battery chemistries available, combined with the variety of batterypowered applications, results in each battery application having specific, unique requirements\npertinent to the specific battery application. However, there are basic requirements for all battery\ndesigns and applications, which are listed in section 4. Section 5 includes a description of\nhazards and controls and also includes requirements.\nThe following definitions differentiate between requirements and other statements.\nShall:\nThis is the only verb used for binding requirements.\nShould/May: These verbs are used for stating non-mandatory goals or when used in the\nitalicized text herein refer to best practice methods which can be construed as\nexample methods for meeting the requirement it refers to.\nWill:\nThis verb is used for stating facts or declaration of purpose.\nSection 6 includes chemistry-specific information. No requirements appear in that section, only best\npractices.\nShall requirements are summarized in Appendix E.\n\n1\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nIn keeping with the NASA standards template, italicized text is intended to indicate rationale, best\npractice examples, or guidelines; while the italicized text never includes the requirement, it often\nhelps to convey the intent of the requirement.\nIn cases where a requirement includes associated italicized text and that text includes best practice,\nthat best practice can be considered part of an accepted means to address the requirement. If other\nmethods are used, rationale and supporting data demonstrating the adequacy of those methods\nshould be presented and must be reviewed for adequacy by the program\xe2\x80\x99s technical team..\n1.2\n\nResponsibility and Change Authority\n\nThe responsibility for the development of this document lies with the Propulsion and Power\nDivision at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). Change authority resides with the Propulsion\nand Power Division.\n1.3\n\nBattery Design Evaluation and Approval\n\nTo be compliant to the requirements herein, every battery design, along with its safety\nverification program, its ground and/or on-orbit usage plans, and its post-flight processing shall\nbe evaluated and approved by the appropriate technical review panel in the given program or\nproject. Center and program specific examples of the review and approval process can be found\nin Appendix D.\n\n2\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n2.\n\nAPPLICABLE DOCUMENTS\n\n2.1\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nApplicable Documents\nDocument\nNumber\nJPR 1700.1\nJSC-STD- 8080\nJSC 25159\nJSC 63322\nJSC 66548\n49 CFR 173.185\nJWI 8705.3\nSSP 52005 Rev.

The following\nsection addresses the prescribed strategies: failure tolerance and Design for Minimum Risk\n(DFMR).\n4.1.1 Failure Tolerance\nFailure tolerance is the basis of the NASA safety approach. This method is applied in all safety\nevaluations unless it can be proven that a failure tolerance approach is not feasible.\na. Battery systems for crewed spacecraft shall implement failure tolerance as the preferred\napproach to control all catastrophic hazard causes.\nb. The level of failure tolerance shall be the product of an integrated design and safety\nanalysis but be a minimum of one.\nAs an example, to be considered two-fault tolerant, a battery design should be capable of\nmaintaining safe operation or incur a safe shutdown after the imposition of the failure of any two\nmutually independent catastrophic hazard control measures or features.\nFor the purposes of fault tolerance discussions, NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 8705.2B,\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuman Rating Requirements and Guidelines for Space Flight Systems,\xe2\x80\x9d defines \xe2\x80\x9ccatastrophic\nevent\xe2\x80\x9d as one resulting in the death or permanent disability of a crew member or passenger or\nan event resulting in the unplanned loss/destruction of a major element of the crewed space\nsystem during the mission that could potentially result in the death or permanent disability of a\ncrew member or passenger.\nFault tolerance for batteries should consider the toxicity as well as the energy content. This\ntakes into consideration the causes resulting in leakage, rupture, electrical shock, fire, and\nexplosion hazards.\nNote that SSP 30309 provides the requirements for the safety analysis and risk assessment for\nthe ISS.\n4.1.2 Design for Minimum Risk (DFMR)\nSome potentially catastrophic hazards cannot practically be controlled using failure tolerance and\nare exempted from the tolerance requirement provided the risk they pose is mitigated to the\nmaximum practical extent through a defined process in which approved standards and margins\nare implemented to account for the absence of failure tolerance. Herein, this process is called\nDFMR.\n12\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\na. The DFMR approach shall be used to address catastrophic battery hazards that cannot\npractically be controlled by a failure tolerance approach.\nNPR 8705.2B, \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Rating Requirements and Guidelines for Space Flight Systems,\xe2\x80\x9d\nrecognizes that some potentially catastrophic hazards cannot be practically controlled using\nfailure tolerance and are exempted from the tolerance requirement provided they are controlled\nthrough a defined process in which approved standards and margins are implemented to account\nfor the absence of failure tolerance. Herein, this process is called DFMR.\nDFMR is a process that relies on the application of mature/proven technology, robust design\nmargins, and accepted standards for manufacturing, inspection, analysis, test, and operational\nmeasures to mitigate the potential for failures that cannot be controlled by failure tolerance.\nWhen a DFMR approach is used, technical authorities accept that the process has demonstrated\nthe risk of catastrophic hazards has been minimized to the maximum practical extent.\nA risk matrix may be used to demonstrate that the applied methods have reduced the probability\nof occurrence and/or the severity of the hazards to an acceptable level for the intended use.\nThis approach to hazard control takes advantage of existing acceptable processes and best\npractices. Guidance and recommendations for acceptable processes and best practices are\ngiven in Sections 5.0 and 6.0 and in the appendices. If other methods are used, rationale and\nsupporting data demonstrating the adequacy of those methods should be presented.\nExamples of the kinds of battery failures that might employ DFMR include leakage and internal\nshort. Many battery or cell designs become impractical with the implementation of triple\ncontainment to be two-fault tolerant to catastrophic electrolyte leakage. Similarly, the\nimposition of three layers of separators between anode and cathode to be two-fault tolerant to\ncatastrophic cell internal short circuits hazards in many cases can severely degrade\nperformance.\nFor the purposes of streamlining the battery design approval, some simple battery designs below\ncertain low energy and voltage thresholds as specified in Sections 4, 5 and 6 herein also can use\nthe DFMR approach for hazard control.\n4.2\n\nKey Aspects of Engineering Evaluation, Qualification, and Acceptance Testing\n\nThe thorough nature of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s test regime from early engineering evaluation, through\nqualification, and ultimately to acceptance testing is a key aspect in the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s safe use of\nbatteries in its missions. The following section specifies general requirements in those areas and\nprovides references to additional best practices.\n4.2.1 Engineering Evaluation\nThis section addresses the preliminary evaluation of safety and performance features at both the\ncell and battery level and would include the evaluation testing of prospective cells before their\nselection for use in a flight battery. Engineering evaluation commonly includes abuse test\nprotocols intended to assess safety and performance features necessary for the battery design.\na. All cell and battery designs considered for flight shall first undergo evaluation testing to\ncharacterize the performance and safety of the flight battery design.\n13\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nb. Evaluation testing shall, at a minimum, consist of characterizing the cell and battery\nsafety under abuse conditions of overcharge, over-discharge into reversal, external short\ncircuit and cell internal short circuit, temperature tolerance, vent and burst pressure\ndetermination and for custom batteries (greater than 20 Wh), cell destructive physical\nanalysis.\nc. Evaluation testing shall confirm manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications that are relevant to the\nproject, as well as confirm that the cell and/or battery design can handle unique\nrequirements levied by the project.\nIn the case where safety features at the cell level are rendered less effective when the cells are\nassembled into the battery, abuse testing at the cell level and then subsequently at progressive\nlevels of assembly evaluates the effectiveness of these features.\nAccelerating Rate Calorimetry (ARC) testing should be performed on cells to establish a\nbaseline characterization of thermal signature (calorific output as a function of temperature) for\ncells being used in custom batteries.\nCell designs used in custom batteries should be examined by a combination of computed\ntomography and destructive physical analysis (DPA) (tear down) to assess quality of\nmanufacture and absence of defects.\nWhen performing battery safety tests that simulate abuse conditions, the mechanical and thermal\nenvironment of the test article should be representative of conditions expected during normal\nuse.\nJSC 66548 can be used as an example for the flight certification and acceptance of COTS\nlithium-ion batteries that details the level of testing required under the engineering,\nqualification, flight acceptance, and lot sample testing of COTS lithium-ion batteries.\n4.2.2 Qualification Testing\nThis section addresses the qualification testing of the flight battery.\na. Qualification testing shall be performed to the worst-case relevant flight environments\nwith margin.\nThe qualification sample of batteries should be randomly sampled from units from the\nflight lot that have passed acceptance testing.\nb. Environmental tests shall include, at a minimum, extreme temperature exposures,\nvacuum, and vibration tests.\nThe margin used for qualification tests will be provided by the respective projects or programs\nor from SSP41172 for ISS environments. Appendix C may be used as a guideline for\nqualification vibration tests (QVTs) for cells and batteries if there are no project-provided\nenvironments. The margin proposed here should be consistent with the program\xe2\x80\x99s margining\npolicies. In the event none are provided, as a guideline, 6 db above the maximum expected is\ntypically used.\nThe qualification of the battery should include testing the batteries to environmental and\nvibration levels that are higher than the mission requirements. The number of flight missions\n14\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nthat the batteries will be used for, along with the location of the battery in the spacecraft, should\ndetermine the period and level of vibration. As a minimum, the qualification test program\nshould include the following:\n1. Functional baseline test (open circuit voltage (OCV), mass, capacity or load check,\ninternal resistance, visual inspection).\n2. Vibration to qualification levels.\n3. Functional baseline test recheck.\n4. Charge/discharge cycles (for rechargeable batteries) or a load test (for primary\nbatteries) at 20 degrees Fahrenheit (\xc2\xb0F) margin above and below worst-case hot and\nworst-case cold, respectively.\n5. Functional baseline test recheck.\n6. Vacuum (approx. 0.1 psi) or equivalent leak checks.\n7. Functional baseline test recheck.\nFor batteries used in a pressurized volume or environment, exposure to a vacuum environment\n(approximately 0.1 psi) for a minimum of 6 hours. For batteries used in an unpressurized\nvolume or environment, thermal vacuum cycles must be performed with the deep vacuum levels\nof 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x935 Torr (instead of the 0.1 psi used for habitable volume/pressurized environments).\nAlternatively, the thermal cycles and vacuum environment tests can be performed independently.\nIf the acceptance test vibration levels and spectra used to screen cells for manufacturing\ndefects are not enveloped by the mission vibration levels, a separate qualification for acceptance\nvibration test (AVT) should be performed to verify that the screening levels do not degrade cell\nreliability.\nThe qualification batteries should pass all cell and battery acceptance tests as described in\nSection 4.2.3 prior subjecting them to qualification tests.\nFor custom battery designs, safety (abuse) testing performed during engineering evaluation\nshould be repeated at qualification with pass/fail criteria for the qualification tests determined\nbased on information derived during engineering evaluation.\nc. Flight cell lot destructive testing shall consume a randomly selected sample size that is, at\nminimum, 3 percent of the flight lot size or three cells, whichever is greater for each\ndestructive test.\nThis is to adequately populate the test matrix necessary to confirm critical safety and\nperformance characteristics, especially those features that are critical for mission and\ncrew safety. For COTS batteries, cells can be obtained from the disassembly of a sample\nfrom the battery flight lot. To achieve statistically significant results, all initial lot tests\nmust be populated with a minimum of three cells.\nd. The operation of cell safety devices, if used as a control at the battery level, shall be\nverified by a qualification test at the battery level or at a level that accurately simulates\nthe level at which the control is required to confirm the operation of the safety device.\nThe pass/fail criteria for these qualification tests should be established after engineering\nevaluation tests are completed.\ne. Qualification testing shall be performed at the battery level, using flight equivalent\nbuilds.\n15\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nMultiple qualification units may be used to run different tests in parallel. Tests may be\nre-sequenced to accommodate schedule and resource constraints as long as the intent of\nthe test is not compromised.\nJSC 66548 can be used as an example for the flight certification and acceptance of COTS\nlithium-ion batteries that details the level of testing required under the engineering,\nqualification, flight acceptance, and lot sample testing of COTS lithium-ion batteries.\n4.2.3 Acceptance Testing\nThis section addresses the acceptance testing of the flight battery.\na. All cell lots intended for custom flight batteries shall undergo 100-percent acceptance\nscreening that includes, at minimum, visual inspection, mass, OCV retention, alternating\ncurrent (AC) and/or direct current (DC) resistance, and capacity (for rechargeable\nchemistries) or load check (for primary chemistries).\nb. All of the batteries intended for flight shall undergo flight acceptance (nondestructive)\ntesting, which will include an evaluation of OCV, mass, capacity (for rechargeable\nchemistries) or load check (for primaries), internal resistance, visual inspection, vibration\nto flight acceptance levels, and thermal/vacuum testing.\nAs a minimum, the flight acceptance test program should include the following:\n1. Functional baseline test (OCV, mass, capacity (for rechargeable chemistries or load\ncheck for primaries), internal resistance, and visual inspection).\n2. Vibration to flight acceptance levels (see Appendix A for more details).\n3. Functional baseline test recheck.\n4. Vacuum (approx. 0.1 psi) or equivalent leak checks.\n5. Functional baseline test recheck.\nFor batteries used in a pressurized volume or environment, exposure to a vacuum\nenvironment (approximately 0.1 psi) for a minimum of 6 hours.\nFor batteries used in an unpressurized volume or environment, thermal vacuum cycles\nmust be performed with the deep vacuum levels of 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x935 Torr (instead of the 0.1 psi\nused for habitable volume/pressurized environments).\nAlternatively, the thermal cycles and vacuum environment tests can be performed\nindependently.\nDetails of recommended flight acceptance tests are provided under each battery chemistry\nsection in Section 6 with a detailed example in Section 6\xe2\x80\x99s lithium-ion section. For those\nchemistries not listed in Section 6, early consultation with program technical staff is\nrecommended.\nJSC 66548 can be used as an example for the flight certification and acceptance of COTS\nlithium-ion batteries that details the level of testing required under the engineering,\nqualification, flight acceptance, and lot sample testing of COTS lithium-ion batteries.\n\n16\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n4.3\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nManufacturing Quality\n\nThis section contains quality related provisions on the manufacturing lot and is intended to\noutline certain key aspects of manufacturing quality.\n4.3.1 Configuration Control\nCustom cell and battery designs intended for flight shall only be procured from vendors with\nconfiguration control processes approved by the NASA-program.\nConfiguration control is adequate when the manufacturer maintains documentation that enables\ncontrol and replication of all tools, fixtures, machines, instruments, settings, environmental\nconditions, contaminant mitigation measures, materials, and pass/fail criteria for the production\nof a unique cell/battery design. This includes periodic independent verification of the certificates\nof compliance and/or analyses to meet required specifications for composition, impurities, and\nproperties of materials and components. Configuration control requires complete two-way\ntraceability, which is defined as documentation that demonstrates a solid chain of custody from\nincoming materials to final assembly and vice versa.\nCustom cell designs should have independent material verifications by the cell manufacturer or\ncustomer (NASA or NASA contractor) and should not rely on a material specification sheet.\n4.3.2 Subsequent Flight Lot Testing\nSome applications could require additional lots of flight batteries/cells beyond the original lot\nthat was acceptance tested, qualified, and approved for flight. Key safety features must be\nretested to be sure that the new cell lots are performing like the previous qualified lot.\na. Any new battery lot and/or cell date code shall be assumed to be a new design and\nrequire a repeat of all battery and/or cell lot qualification testing and mitigation measures\nspecified in Section 4.2.2.\nAn exception can be made for COTS cell batches delivered with two date codes that\nrepresent consecutive days if it can be verified they are part of a single production run.\nb. Subsequent flight cell lot destructive testing shall confirm that subsequent lot\nperformance and safety features are the same as that of the original qualification lot.\nA key purpose of this repetition is to gain confidence that configuration control of the\nmanufacturing process is still effective and that the new cell lots are performing like the previous\nqualified lot. For example, if a cell internal fusible link is used as a control for external short\ncircuit hazards, sample cells from each subsequent lot should be tested to confirm that the fusible\nlink works as expected.\nLot sample testing is carried out to confirm that the safety tolerances of the cells/batteries\nremain the same compared with the original lot. A statistically significant number of\ncells/batteries should be randomly selected for lot sample testing and should be based on the\n17\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nflight program, the number of cells manufactured, the period between manufacturing of the lots,\nthe original materials that go into the manufacturing of a single lot, etc. A 3- to 6-percent\nsample size has been used for past flight battery programs.\nSubsequent flight lot destructive testing can consist of a reduced set of lot sample testing but\nshould include computed tomography (CT)/DPA, capacity (primary), 100-percent depth of\ndischarge (DoD) cycle life (rechargeable), ARC (lithium), short circuit, and overcharge\n(rechargeable).\nARC testing should be performed on cells and compared with baseline characterization of the\nthermal signature to evaluate consistency of subsequent lots.\n4.4\n\nGeneral Design Requirements\n\nThe following design requirements are general in nature. They are generally applicable to all\nbattery builds.\n4.4.1 Electrical Interconnection\nThe solid interconnection of cells to make up the battery is crucial in preventing ohmic heating,\nwhich would result in reduced performance and/or life and may result in a hazardous overheating\nof cells within the battery.\na. The electrical interconnections that form the pack through the interconnection of cells\nshall be made of low-resistance connections such that ohmic heating at the design load\npresents no over-temperature hazard.\nb. The means of interconnection (i.e., mechanical fasteners, tack weld, etc.) and its\nverification shall ensure that the flight environments and usage profile do not reduce the\neffectiveness of the connection.\nIn the case of bus bar interconnections via threaded fasteners, flight vibration as well as thermal\nvariation over the course of the load profile would tend to loosen the connection. Torqueing\nrequirements coupled with fastener locking features are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of\nthe connection throughout the mission (reference NASA-STD-5020, \xe2\x80\x9cRequirements for Threaded\nFastening Systems in Spaceflight Hardware,\xe2\x80\x9d for best practices).\n4.4.2 Electrical Wiring\nThe integrity of wire and the insulation used within the battery must be ensured.\na. Wiring used within the flight battery shall adhere to Electrical Wire and Cable\nAcceptance Tests described in JSC-STD-8080.5 E-24 or be certified via an equivalent\nstandard.\n4.4.3 Lithium-ion Battery and Cell Monitoring\nFor lithium-ion batteries, monitoring of key parameters such as cell/battery voltages, cell\ntemperature, and battery/string current is necessary to ascertain health and maintain safe\n18\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\noperation of the battery. Monitoring of pertinent parameters may show adverse trends in the\nstate of health and can be essential to investigating failures within the battery.\na. For custom or COTS batteries with catastrophic failure modes due to cell under/over\nvoltage, monitoring shall be provided in order to detect and control hazardous under/over\nvoltage of any cell in the battery.\nThe requirements here seek to strike a balance between monitoring required for safety\nand the reliability of the battery and accompanying instrumentation.\nb. For custom or COTS batteries with catastrophic failure modes due to high currents,\nbattery-level current monitoring shall be provided in order to detect and control\nhazardous currents in the battery.\nc. For custom or COTS batteries with catastrophic failure modes due to high/low\ntemperatures, temperature monitoring shall be provided to detect and control hazardous\ntemperatures at any cell in the battery.\nOptimal number and placement of the temperature sensors to provide adequate coverage\nfor all cells should be based on high-fidelity thermal analysis for nominal and offnominal conditions.\nd. For custom battery designs with catastrophic failure modes, instrumentation shall collect\ndata during use and during charge and be reviewable on the ground for use in trending\nand/or post anomaly analysis.\nThe requirements above focus on key measurements and time periods for monitoring. For\nexample, a requirement to monitor key parameters even when not in use (i.e., on the shelf) may\nbe prohibitive (i.e., may drive a monitoring system that is self-powered and self-contained within\nthe battery) and yield other adverse effects.\n4.4.4 Cell Matching\nCell performance matching for selection into batteries is a useful practice in custom battery\nbuilds when done in addition to cell acceptance screening specified in Section 4.2.3b.\na. For custom batteries with catastrophic failure modes, cell performance matching prior to\nbattery assembly shall be performed to mitigate state-of-charge (SOC) imbalances that\ncould adversely affect battery performance and/or safety.\nb. For custom batteries with catastrophic failure modes, cells shall be matched in a battery\nbased on charge retention, internal resistance and/or AC impedance, and ampere-hour\ncapacity (for rechargeable chemistries).\nThe requirements above prescribe a matching protocol intended to select from the\nacceptance screened lot of cells. These requirements are not a remedy for poor lot\nuniformity. Note that cell matching and the use of balancing circuits should not be rationale\nfor accepting lots with poor cell lot uniformity, which indicates a less controlled\nmanufacturing process and may indicate product with a higher likelihood of rapid\ndegradation of field performance.\n\n19\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n4.4.5 Dissimilar Controls\nFor battery chemistries with catastrophic failure modes due to excessive charge or discharge\n(including external short circuit), software-based controls to mitigate these hazards are more and\nmore common. These controllers manage the charging and discharging of the battery within safe\nparameters and can be located in the battery charger, the power distribution system, and/or the\nbattery itself.\na. For custom batteries with catastrophic failure modes, software-based controls responsible\nfor managing the charge/discharge of the battery shall operate inside a safe envelope\nmaintained by active or passive hardware-based controls and guards.\nb. For custom batteries with catastrophic failure modes, in cases where software-based\ncontrols are not enveloped by hardware controls, the software is safety critical and its\ndevelopment shall include conventional software assurance processes and confidence not\nbased solely on integrated testing.\n4.5\n\nMission Usage\na. During the preparation phase for on-orbit processing, the hardware owner shall provide\ndetails for safe operation of the hardware on-orbit, any on-orbit processing that may be\nrequired, and safe stowage or disposal.\nb. The hardware owner shall establish on-orbit processes and operational constraints in\ncoordination with the mission controllers for the hardware.\nProvide on-orbit processes that may include procedures for hardware inspection and\ncheckout that are required prior to on-orbit usage of the equipment.\nProvide procedures to dispose of depleted cell(s) and batteries and replace them if the\nbattery-powered applications are designed for on-orbit replacement.\nProvide procedures for recharging, re-installing, and storing rechargeable cells and\nbatteries if the application is designed for rechargeable cells or batteries.\nProvide procedures to remove, visually inspect, tape, and bag depleted or discrepant\ncells and battery packs and place them in dry trash.\nNOTE: For cells and batteries that are returned as trash on Russian vehicles, the\nrequirements given in P32928-103, "Requirement for International Partner Cargoes\nTransported on Russian Progress and Soyuz Vehicles," are followed.\nCrew members should record anomalies during any phase of battery use from\ninstallation and usage through removal/recharge to storage/disposal.\nc. For the custom lithium-ion battery designs that are greater than 12 volts (V) and\n60 Wh and required to be used in a crewed environment for more than 1 year or for\nmultiple missions requiring launch and landing, the health of the battery shall be\nmonitored to allow insight into changes that could lead to a catastrophic failure.\nThe long-term physical and chemical changes associated with the cells and internal\nconstruction of the batteries are not typically fully understood when a custom-designed\n20\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nbattery is flown for space application; hence, it is imperative to monitor the health of the\nbattery. Techniques such as thermography when the battery is under load can provide\ninformation on bad welds or electrical connections; unique discharge loads with a high\ncurrent pulse inserted to provide internal resistance measurements can also provide a\nwarning to changes that may lead to a catastrophic failure.\nA fleet leader may be provided on ground to monitor and characterize the health and\nphysical appearance of the battery. The fleet leader should have storage and operating\ntime and cycles, with margin, in excess of the flight units to provide confidence that any\nanomalous behavior may be detected prior to occurring in flight.\n4.6\n\nPost-flight Cell and Pack Evaluation\na. A post-flight performance evaluation of the hardware and the batteries shall be conducted\nwhen hardware is returned post-flight.\nb. For cells and batteries installed in hardware during return flight, after the post-flight\nevaluation, the cells and battery pack shall be removed so that the equipment may be\nstored without the cells and pack installed.\nAn exception is made for coin cells that provide memory storage for hardware. Cells\nproviding memory storage need not be removed unless performance degradation has\nbeen noted, the shelf life has expired, or signs of damage or corrosion are evident.\n\nFor additional information, battery storage is defined in JSC 63322, \xe2\x80\x9cPackaging Requirements\nfor Launch, On-Orbit Storage and Disposal of Batteries,\xe2\x80\x9d and JSC 26549, \xe2\x80\x9cJSC Manual for\nControl of Program Stock.\xe2\x80\x9d Details regarding the process for post-flight removal of cells or\nbattery packs are provided in JWI 8705.3.\n4.7\n\nGround Processing Requirements\n\nBattery systems intended for crewed spacecraft must maintain safety during ground handling,\ntransportation, and ground operations. While this document contains a number of items that\nshould be considered to ensure safety of ground battery operations and handling, the subset listed\nin this section is considered necessary and contains requirements to ensure safe operation.\na. The hardware developer or provider shall establish protocols and controls to address\nidentified hazards and document those processes in the safety data package prepared for\nthe system.\n4.7.1 Requirements for Ground Handling and Transportation\na. Sufficient ventilation shall be provided when processing non-sealed batteries to ensure\nthat the concentrations of electrolyte vapors, combustible gases, or toxic gases do not\nreach 50 percent of the lower exposure limit (LEL).\nb. Ground handling and transportation shall be in accordance with JPR 1700.1, \xe2\x80\x9cJSC Safety\nand Health Handbook,\xe2\x80\x9d or equivalent standards.\n\n21\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nGround handling and transportation best practices include:\na. Battery test benches and tables should be coated with electrolyte-impervious coatings.\nb. The battery test areas should have a designated eye wash station and shower.\nc. Primary lithium and lithium-ion battery transportation on-site and off-site should meet\nDepartment of Transportation (DoT) requirements per 49 CFR 173.185.\nd. Lithium primary and lithium-ion rechargeable batteries that are to be transported over\npublicly accessed roads with lithium equivalent content exceeding 8.0 grams per battery\nshould have warning labels in accordance with DoT requirements per 49 CFR 173.185.\ne. Shock sensors should be installed on containers transporting cells and batteries\n(typically classified as Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Class 9 by 49 CFR).\nf. Temperature sensors should be installed on containers transporting cells and batteries\n(typically classified as HAZMAT Class 9 by 49 CFR).\ng. The charge level for secondary lithium and lithium-ion cells and batteries transported on\npublicly accessed roadways should not exceed 50 percent of rated charge capacity.\nJWI 8705.3, \xe2\x80\x9cBattery Processing.\xe2\x80\x9d contains excellent guidance regarding ground handling.\n4.7.2 Design and Operations Requirements for Ground Support Equipment\nGround support equipment (GSE) consists of the non-flight systems, equipment, or devices (with\na physical or functional interface with flight hardware) necessary to routinely support the\noperations of transporting, receiving, handling, assembly, inspection, test, checkout, and\nservicing of flight hardware.\na. GSE for batteries shall be designed such that the combination of the battery and GSE\ndoes not reduce the level of failure tolerance intended in the flight battery design.\nEquipment used to test or charge batteries should have redundant controls in place,\nincluding dissimilar redundancy to prevent hazards due to malfunction of test equipment.\nBest practices in GSE design include but are not limited to:\na. The polarity of GSE connecting to battery terminals should be keyed.\nb. For external chargers, the specification document for the charger should be used as\nguidance for the build and test procedures.\nc. COTS GSE should not be modified without GSE manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations and\napproval.\nd. All test equipment, especially those interfacing with flight batteries, should be calibrated\nperiodically as required by the equipment manufacturer. Verification of calibration\nshould be confirmed before the start of test so that no calibration will be required during\nthe test program.\ne. Test protocols programmed into the GSE should have tolerance ranges for all the\nparameters used for charging or operation.\nf. Test protocols programmed into the GSE should have design limits specified for the test\nparameters.\n22\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\ng. Test protocols programmed into the GSE should have safety limits specified for the test\nprogram.\nh. The test equipment should be designed with limits that prevent restart of equipment or\ncontinuation of the test in the event of power, test equipment, or battery failures.\ni. Safety devices and mandatory verification steps should be incorporated into the GSE\ndesigns and handling/operating procedures, especially where failure tolerance is not met\nby the battery system alone.\nj. GSE should be verified to operate safely prior to connecting a battery to it.\nk. Uninterrupted power supply should be provided for all GSE that involves critical testing,\nsuch as testing of flight batteries.\nl. Battery test equipment should be internally protected against short circuits.\nm. Battery test equipment should not impose short circuits on the test article.\nn. Access to emergency eye wash, shower, or combination units for the battery charging\nand conditioning area should not be obstructed and should be no more than 25 feet\ndistant or 10 seconds travel time from the battery test area.\no. Personnel involved with handling, testing, installing, or any other battery-related\noperations should be trained as required in the specific battery chemistry safety. Test\nteam personnel should receive daily briefings on the tasks to be carried out each day with\nan emphasis on safety.\np. All battery storage should be in accordance with the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification and\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).\nq. A Lith-X or Class ABC fire extinguisher, as required per the MSDS of the batteries,\nshould be available in the test location.\n4.8\n\nShelf and Service Life Related Requirements\na. Shelf and service life of batteries shall be tracked.\nAppendix C provides further details on the shelf life and service life of various commonly\nused cell chemistries.\n\n23\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n5.\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nGENERAL BATTERY HAZARDS AND CONTROLS\n\nPotential hazards and safe design requirements are discussed in this section. Hazard sources are\nidentified, hazard manifestations are explained, and hazard prevention and control requirements\nare presented. Not all controls will apply to all battery designs; hence, thorough identification of\nhazards and controls is required to prove design safety.\nAt minimum, fire/explosion, chemical exposure, electrical shock, and touch temperature are\nbattery hazards to crewed spacecraft and crew.\nRequirements:\na. The possible sources of battery hazards shall be identified for each battery design while\nconsidering the entire set of mission phases and conditions.\nb. Each hazard shall be evaluated to determine applicability and to identify all sources,\nwhich can be broadly categorized as inadequate design, poor workmanship, and/or abuse\n(electrical, mechanical, and/or thermal).\nSee Section 6 for details of chemistry-specific battery hazard sources.\nc. The hazard severity shall be categorized as catastrophic, critical, or non-critical.\n5.1\n\nFire/Explosion Hazard\n\nFire and/or explosion hazards can result from the generation and ignition of a combustible gas\nmixture, evolution of large quantities of free gases, or initiation of a runaway internal reaction in\na cell (thermal runaway). Excessive internal pressure (either within cell or battery enclosure) can\nresult in failure of cell and/or battery seals and cases. Cell and/or battery contents can then be\nexpelled from the cell, either slowly or forcibly. Shrapnel fragments from violent cell or battery\nenclosure bursting can cause damage upon impact to personnel, structure, or equipment.\n5.1.1 Sources \xe2\x80\x93 Chemical Reaction\n1. Some batteries generate hydrogen and/or oxygen while discharging and/or charging.\nHydrogen gas, mixed with air or oxygen, is flammable and/or explosive over a\nconcentration range of 4 percent to 75 percent by volume in air.\n2. Many aqueous electrolyte cells subjected to charging will generate oxygen as the charge\nnears completion, providing oxygen where none may have existed previously, such as in\na battery container that had been purged with nitrogen to flush away oxygen.\n3. Accumulation of gases in a sealed cell or battery case can build up pressure within the\ncase.\n4. A plugged or faulty pressure relief valve in a cell or battery enclosure.\n5. Electrolysis of aqueous electrolyte on ground paths into hydrogen and oxygen, creating\nan explosive gas mixture.\n6. Vaporization and decomposition of flammable electrolytes to form flammable gases or\naerosols.\n24\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n5.1.1.1 Requirements \xe2\x80\x93 Chemical Reaction\nFlammability\na. Design of the hardware shall limit accumulation of hydrogen in enclosed spaces\ncontaining oxygen to less than 2 percent of the total free-space volume.\nThe traditional means of avoiding hydrogen accumulation is to provide continuous air\nventilation at a rate sufficient to dilute evolved hydrogen below 2.0 percent, which gives\n100-percent margin below the 4-percent flammability level. Wherever a flammable\nand/or explosive mixture of hydrogen and oxygen may exist, an ignition source is\npresumed to exist because the energy required for ignition of stoichiometric hydrogen\nand oxygen mixtures is only on the order of 1 to 2 microjoules.\nb. Electrolyte absorbing materials used in battery designs shall be nonflammable or flame\nretardant.\nElectrically conductive battery parts should be insulated to protect against a\nflammability hazard if the absorbent material could trap flammable electrolyte against\nthose conductive battery parts.\nThe volume of void spaces inside the battery case that cannot be eliminated by design\nshould be filled with electrolyte-resistant nonflammable filler, such as potting material or\nelectrolyte absorbent material. Fillers limit the volume and mass of gases that can\naccumulate prior to venting, thus limiting the force of any gas explosion.\nVenting of Battery Enclosure\nc. The battery enclosure and cells shall prevent excessive pressure buildup due to gas\naccumulation.\nA venting feature is a designed opening or an intended weak point that will release below\nan intended pressure. A relief valve is a mechanism designed to open at a specified\npressure and may or may not reseal after the pressure is released.\nDepending on the cell chemistry and cell case, the venting feature may need a liquid\nimpermeable, gas permeable covering to trap electrolyte while venting gases.\nCell vents or relief valves should not be blocked or plugged with the application of\npotting materials that would prevent them from venting safely.\nd. Relief valves and vents used as controls for the accumulation of excessive pressure shall\nbe tested.\nCell vents should be tested in a flight-like mechanical configuration to verify that they\noperate correctly at the designed pressure.\nRelief valves on battery enclosures should be tested after installation to verify that they\noperate correctly at the designed pressure.\n\n25\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nBurst of Pressurized Battery Chemistries\ne. If the battery cell enclosure failure mode is demonstrated to be leak-before-burst, then the\nratio of failure pressure to vent pressure shall be a minimum of 1.5:1.\nA test of relief-valve-equipped cells and battery cases should disable the relief function\nand then apply an internal pressure equal to 1.5 times the relief valve maximum vent\npressure. There should be no detectable leak.\nLeak-before-burst: A design concept in which potentially critical flaws will grow through\nthe wall of the pressurized hardware and cause pressure-relieving leakage rather than\nburst (catastrophic failure) at maximum design pressure.\nf. All other cell enclosures shall demonstrate a minimum ratio of failure pressure to vent\npressure of 2.5:1.\ng. Cells that do not meet the 1.5:1 ratio shall not be used for manned space applications.\nBatteries with pressurized metallic cells that exceed an internal pressure of 100 psi are\nclassified as special pressurized equipment and must meet the leak-before-burst failure\nmode, demonstrate a minimum factor of safety for the design burst to maximum design\npressure of 1.5:1 and follow acceptance and qualification test requirements as called out\nin ANSI/AIAA S-080-1998, \xe2\x80\x9cSpace Systems \xe2\x80\x93 Metallic Pressure Vessels, Pressurized\nStructures, and Pressure Components.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor fracture control, batteries are unique forms of pressurized containers. Batteries and\nbattery systems can be classified as non-fracture-critical by meeting one of the following:\n1. Non-hazardous leak-before-burst design.\n2. The pressure of the sealed container is less than 689.5 KPa (100 psia); the sealed\ncontainer does not contain a hazardous fluid; and loss of pressure in the system\nwill not result in a catastrophic hazard.\n3. Small batteries that fall under the noncritical category are exempt from fracture\ncontrol.\nOtherwise, the requirements of NASA-STD-5019, \xe2\x80\x9cFracture Control Requirements for\nSpaceflight Hardware,\xe2\x80\x9d must be addressed.\n5.1.2 Sources \xe2\x80\x93 Overcharge Failure/Over-discharge Failure\n1. Failure of charge control devices such as smart chips, feedback loops, switches,\ntemperature sensors, and timing devices.\n2. Inadvertent charging of primary/nonrechargeable batteries.\n3. Improper design of a device containing both a battery and an additional power source that\nalso contains a battery (primary or secondary) which unintentionally creates a current\npath that can lead to inadvertent transfer of charge between the two sources.\n4. Improper charging device or method.\n5. Increase in cell imbalance caused when batteries with unbalanced cells in series are\ncharged and discharged, which leads to further variations in cell voltages and/or\ncapacities with service life. This can lead to inadvertent over-discharge of one or more\n26\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\ncells in a string, potentially causing the weak cells to go into a voltage reversal (overdischarge) condition.\n6. Circulating currents between parallel-connected cell stacks resulting from lowered\nvoltage in one or more stacks due to cell or insulating material degradation, followed by\ncurrent flow from adjacent electrically sound stacks as a result of the difference between\nstack potentials.\n5.1.2.1 Requirements - Overcharge Failure/Over-discharge Failure\na. The battery/charger design shall maintain required failure tolerance against overcharge/\nover-discharge failure.\nb. Operational procedures shall ensure that the battery is not operated outside limits\nrecommended by the cell/battery pack manufacturer or that established during\nqualification testing.\nc. The charger shall be designed for the specific type of battery being used and incorporate\nthe necessary charge termination controls.\nCharge termination criteria usually vary with battery chemistry.\nd. Inadvertent charging of primary batteries shall be prevented.\nFor batteries with cells or cell strings that should not be charged (as in primary/\nnonrechargeable batteries), redundant serial blocking diodes should be installed in each\nparallel leg of a battery consisting of primary cells to prevent circulating currents\nbetween parallel cells or cell stacks, unless tests show these currents cannot present\ncatastrophic failure modes. Small Schottky diodes have been used for this purpose to\nminimize voltage drop.\ne. Uncontrolled charging of secondary batteries shall be prevented.\nf. Charger circuit schematic shall be reviewed and evaluated for required failure tolerance.\ng. For external chargers, the specification document for the charger shall be used as\nguidance for the development of in-flight charging procedures.\nh. If it can lead to a hazardous condition, the charger shall be designed to stop charging the\nbattery after a set period of time to prevent continuous balancing charge discharge loops.\ni. Operational tolerances of the charger shall not exceed the safe operating range of the cell\nor battery.\nj. Operational protocols programmed into battery chargers used on spacecraft shall have\nsafety limits specified.\n5.1.3 Sources \xe2\x80\x93 External Short Circuit\n1. External to battery short circuit sources:\na. Bridging at the power or sense voltage connectors\nb. Bridging with the power (charging), load, or voltage sense cables\nc. Bridging at the battery load, charging source, or voltage monitor\n2. Internal to battery but external to cell short circuit sources:\n27\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\na. Faulty bussing/cell interconnect insulation\nb. Faulty wiring insulation\nc. Conductive electrolyte leakage path\nd. Conductive condensation or water intrusion path\ne. Faulty cell-to-cell electrical isolation\nf. Faulty cell-to-structure electrical isolation\ng. Conductive contaminant bridge\n3. Circulating currents due to corona arcing between poorly insulated conductive surfaces in\nhigh-voltage batteries while exposed to low pressures.\n5.1.3.1 Requirements \xe2\x80\x93 External Short Circuit\na. External shorts to the battery shall be controlled using a combination of preventive\ncontrols.\nExternal shorts are normally prevented using insulative barriers and current limiters.\nInsulative barriers include well-insulated connectors with adequate separation between\npositive and negative battery pins, adequate cable insulation, insulation between internal\ncell terminals and the battery case, insulation between banks of series cells, etc.\nCircuit interrupters that are rated well below the battery\'s peak current source capability\nshould be installed in the battery power circuit. Interrupters may be fuses, circuit\nbreakers, thermal switches, PTCs, or other effective devices. Circuit interrupters (as one\nof several design constraints on limiter sizing) such as fuses should be rated at\n200 percent of the maximum load to be provided by the battery in order to avoid nuisance\ntrips. Circuit interrupters other than fuses should be rated at a value that is equal to or\nlower than the maximum current that the cell is capable of handling without causing\nventing, smoke, explosion, fire, or thermal runaway.\nSince the battery case is usually grounded/bonded to the structure, the interrupters\nshould be in the ground (negative) leg of a battery where the negative terminal is\nconnected to ground. Where the circuit is \xe2\x80\x9cfloating,\xe2\x80\x9d as in plastic battery cases used in\nthose for portable electronic devices, the circuit interrupters can be placed in either\nleg. In either case, the circuit interrupters should be placed as close to the cell or battery\nterminals as the design will allow to maximize the zone of protection.\nThe cell and battery maximum continuous and pulse current-carrying capability dictated\nby worst-case operating conditions should be confirmed by testing to verify that the\nbattery remains safe under those conditions and that the current limiter(s) have been\nproperly selected to clear short circuits while avoiding nuisance trips.\nb. Controls for battery external shorts shall be tested at the appropriate and relevant battery\nconfiguration in the relevant environment.\nThe appropriate configuration and environment is critical during the test, as factors such\nas thermal gradients, heat dissipation paths, heat transfer, as well as the currentcarrying capability of the interconnects and cells vary with battery design as well as with\nenvironment (e.g., temperatures, pressurized versus unpressurized environments, etc.).\n\n28\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nThe smart external short (external to the battery) circuit test uses an impedance in the\nexternal circuit that is set just below the limits of the current limiters in the battery pack\ndesign, such that the battery tolerances are tested under maximum stress conditions.\nc. The battery packs shall be tested for shorts (bypassing all battery level current limiters) of\nthe low and high impedance types and provide protection controls accordingly.\nCell level safety controls may not work effectively, as safety controls at the battery level\nor may become a hazard cause themselves. Hence, testing in the relevant configuration\nand environment is critical to understanding the worst-case hazards. For example, celllevel controls such as positive thermal coefficient (PTC) current limiting devices should\nbe characterized by test and should be shown to be effective at the cell and appropriate\nstring or bank level before the flight design is completed as a part of the engineering\nevaluation described in section 4.2.1. The appropriate configuration and environment is\ncritical during the test, as factors such as thermal gradients, heat dissipation paths, heat\ntransfer, as well as the current-carrying capability of the interconnects and cells vary\nwith battery design as well as with environment (e.g., temperatures, pressurized versus\nunpressurized environments, etc.).\nLow impedance shorts, also known as hard shorts, are short circuits of the lowest\npossible impedance in the external circuit that can be applied during test. Cables,\nconnectors, and instrumentation are all designed to minimize impedance applied to the\nbattery pack under test.\nA high impedance short (smart shorts external to cell but internal to battery) occurs\ninside the battery that has been determined to be a worst-case condition (determined by\nanalysis and engineering evaluation test) for the battery pack as the cell response falls\noutside the purview of the protective devices.\nCell level controls such as PTC current limiting devices should be characterized before\nthe flight design is completed. PTC device limitations should be characterized using tests\nand should be shown to be effective by testing at the cell and appropriate string or bank\nlevel.\nAbsorbent material should be provided to absorb any condensation that may occur due to\nwidely varying temperature changes. Such condensation on conductive surfaces within\nthe battery could lead to a short circuit.\nd. The surfaces of battery terminals on the outside of the battery case shall be protected\nfrom accidental bridging.\nThis may be accomplished by using a scoop-proof female connector, recessing stud-type\nterminals, installation of effective insulating barriers, etc.\ne. All inner surfaces of metal battery enclosures shall be anodized and/or coated with a nonelectrically conductive electrolyte-resistant paint to prevent a subsequent short circuit\nhazard.\nf. Battery and cell terminals shall be protected from contact with other conductive surfaces.\nExamples include potting the terminals with room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV)\nsilicone or other nonconductive sealants or by isolating the terminals with a\n29\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nnonconductive barrier. Leaked electrolyte is also a conductor that can be a cause of a\nshort.\ng. Battery terminals that pass through metal battery enclosures shall be insulated from the\ncase by an insulating collar or other effective means.\nh. Wires inside the battery case shall be insulated, restrained from contact with cell\nterminals, protected against chafing, and physically constrained from movement due to\nvibration or shock.\nThis should be verified by inspection of each final battery assembly before it is\ncompletely sealed. The qualification unit should be inspected after vibration and shock\ntesting.\nStandards for electronic circuit board workmanship, wire crimping, interconnect cables,\nharnessing, wiring, soldering of electrical and electronic assemblies, electrostatic\ndischarge control for protection of electronic components and assemblies, and\nqualification and performance specification for rigid printed boards should be followed\nper the documents listed in Section 2.1.\nControls should be verified by carrying out the insulation/isolation resistance test.\nThe isolation resistance divided by the maximum working voltage of the circuit under test\nshould be at least 100 ohm/V (UL 840 or IECEC60068-2-30).\ni. Adjacent insulative barriers such as layers, wraps, and coatings shall be unlike in design\nand material properties.\nUnlike examples are nonflammable paper, plastic shrink wrap, durable tape, fiberglass,\npenetration resistant layers, etc. Select only electrolyte resistant or compatible materials\nthat can withstand worst-case mission temperature extremes inside the battery.\nj. In battery designs greater than 50 Vdc, corona-induced short circuits (high-voltageinduced gas breakdown) shall be prevented.\nCorona can be mitigated by proper design and material selection (reference MSFC-STD531). If higher voltages and low operating pressures are anticipated or if a single failure\n(leak) can lead to low operating pressures, testing should be performed to verify corona\ndesign mitigations.\n5.1.4 Sources \xe2\x80\x93 Internal Short Circuit Failure\nCatastrophic internal shorts are generally rare events but can be very violent and\ndamaging. Demonstrating tolerance to all external shorts does not imply achieving\ntolerance to all internal shorts. There are no tests that fully screen for the possibility or\nthe severity of outcome for an internal short circuit of an individual cell.\nAlthough thermal runaway has been attributed in some cases to internal shorts, it is\ndifficult to prove that this was the cause due to the loss of evidence after such an event.\nAlthough difficult to prove after an event, this phenomenon has been well studied with\nsimulated internal shorts in a research environment using different methods.\n30\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nInternal shorts can occur in two ways:\n1. Poor quality control of the cell manufacturing process that allow impurities and\ncontaminants to be present as latent defects inside the cell, which can later pierce\nthe separator causing an internal short circuit that can result in electrolyte leakage,\nfire, and thermal runaway.\n2. Cells used beyond their specifications, such as charge and discharge rates beyond\nthe manufacturer\'s recommended limits; exceeding maximum charge current, endof-charge, or end-of-discharge voltages; or exceeding operational temperature\nenvironments.\nIn lithium ion rechargeable batteries, these deviations can cause the deposition of\ndendritic deposits of lithium during charge and of copper after a dissolution and\ndeposition during over-discharge which may cause separator damage. If these\ndendrites create an internal short circuit, localized temperature rise due to\nlocalized high current flow through the internal short circuit can lead to eventual\nthermal runaway and fire due to the flammability of the electrolyte.\nAll cell chemistries and cell designs are susceptible to internal shorts. However, not all\ninternal shorts result in a thermal runaway. If thermal runaway occurs during cell abuse\ntesting (see Section 4.2.1.b), then the cells are referred to as intolerant of internal shorts.\nIn general, most lithium-based cell chemistries are prone to catastrophic internal shorts,\nwhile those with aqueous electrolytes are not.\nSources of internal cell short:\n1. Induced via charge/discharge and temperature abuse, which can cause the\ndeposition of metallic dendrites of copper and/or lithium upon cycling, leading to\nseparator stress to the point of failure.\n2. Separator defects or damage during manufacture or assembly.\n3. Electrode defects (e.g., metallic burrs) and/or degradation .\n4. Tab/lead defects or inadequate isolation.\n5. Misalignment of electrodes and separators during winding/stacking.\n6. Impurities or contaminants.\n7. Soft goods seal or glass-to-metal seal failure that compromises its electrical\nisolation function.\n5.1.4.1 Requirements \xe2\x80\x93 Internal Short Circuit\na. Cells used in COTS batteries or cells selected for a custom battery shall be evaluated to\nascertain the severity of an internal short circuit event.\nEvaluation criteria of the short circuit event can include, but are not limited to, maximum\ncell temperature achieved, time to maximum temperature and duration of event, products\nvented/ejected from the cell, measurement and/or video of flames/hot gases exiting the\ncell, etc.\n\n31\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nInternal short circuits can be initiated and triggered within a cell by various thermal and\nmechanical methods. The mechanical methods involve crushing, penetrating, and/or\nshocking forces applied to the cell. Thermal methods involve heat exposure to damage\nthe separator that insulates the anode and cathode. More advanced methods involve\nimplanting defects into a cell either during manufacture or afterwards and triggering the\nshort by mechanical or thermal means.\nb. Measures shall be taken to reduce the likelihood and/or severity of an internal short\ncircuit event to a level acceptable to the program/project.\nBest practices listed below are intended to minimize the likelihood of a cell internal short event\noccurring. Section 5.1.5 discusses steps to be taken when trying to minimize the\nconsequence/severity of an internal short circuit event in a custom battery design.\n1. Design mitigation measures\na. In the case of a custom battery design, only cell designs whose performance\nand safety have been sufficiently characterized to support safety assessment\nand validation of the abuse tolerance and where insight into the\nmanufacturing control process is provided should be approved.\nb. In the case of COTS battery designs, only batteries whose performance and\nsafety have been sufficiently characterized to support safety assessment and\nvalidation of the abuse tolerance should be approved.\nc. Batteries should be designed to perform well within the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s\nspecifications for the cells used to build the battery.\nd. If a particular cell/battery is to be used in an application or environment that\nis beyond the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification, extensive testing with margin to\npredicted environments should be carried out to confirm that the battery\ndesign will not be driven into a catastrophic safety hazard.\ne. Battery designs should also have the required fault tolerance in place to\nprevent the cells from being subjected to off-nominal conditions that result in\nthe formation of internal shorts.\nf. Cells or batteries used in space applications should not have any records of\nConsumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalls.\n2. Manufacturing mitigation measures\na. For custom battery designs, cells should be selected from cell manufacturers\nwith a mature production history.\nb. Cell lots should be defined for each battery system as all cells with a common\ndate code made from the same continuous production run.\nc. In the case of a custom cell or custom battery design, a cell production line\naudit of the cell design should be conducted to evaluate how well\ncontamination, humidity control, and cell defects are limited in all phases of\ncell production processes. High particle counts and poor contamination and\nhumidity control are known to contribute to the high occurrence of cell\nfailures.\n\n32\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n3. Test mitigation measures\na. For custom battery designs, rigorous 100-percent cell acceptance testing\nshould be carried out, including charge retention (soft shorts), performance\nuniformity. Poor OCV stability, poor coulombic efficiency (discharge amperehour (Ah) out/charge Ah in), internal resistance fluctuations, and high selfdischarge (poor voltage retention) are indicators of internal cell defects that\ncould result in an internal short circuit. As an additional measure, the cells\ncan be X-rayed for jelly roll or stack misalignment and other defects that\ncould cause internal shorts. Credit can be taken for X-rays carried out at the\nmanufacturing facility.\nb. For custom-designed and COTS batteries, early in the cell design selection\nprocess random sample cells should be examined by DPA and nondestructive\nevaluation (NDE) techniques (CT scans or high-resolution X-rays) to look for\ndefects that could develop into latent internal short circuits. Since production\nquality is known to vary from lot to lot, this DPA and NDE sample testing\nshould be required for all flight lots.\nc. All anomalous observations in a DPA should be chemically analyzed and\ndiscussed with the cell manufacturer to determine whether they will lead to a\ncatastrophic latent defect through the life of the cell.\nd. For lithium-ion and primary lithium systems, the vibration test levels shall be\nsignificantly higher than those typically imposed for acceptance tests intended\nto detect workmanship defects (Appendix C). As a consequence, qualification\nacceptance vibration testing, which is done at levels at least two times than\nthat used for acceptance, may be necessary to demonstrate that the higher\nacceptance levels will not adversely impact performance (see Appendix C).\n4. Operation\na. The battery system should be operated in a way that preserves measurably\npositive margins in operating voltage, current, temperature, and cycle life\nversus the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s limits for the cell design.\nb. If the cell/battery is to be used in environments or applications that are\nbeyond the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification, relevant testing should be carried\nout to qualify the battery design to confirm that no failures will develop due to\nthis type of usage during the life of the battery. In addition, samples from\neach new lot should be tested to confirm that this tolerance and safe\nperformance capability exists on subsequent productions.\nInformation on mitigating measures for the lithium-based chemistries is provided in the relevant\nsections in Section 6.\n\n33\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n5.1.5 Sources \xe2\x80\x93 Thermal Runaway Propagation\n1. Thermal runaway can be induced by:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Overcharge (see Section 5.1.2)\n\xef\x82\xb7 Short circuit (see Section 5.1.3)\n\xef\x82\xb7 Internal cell short circuit (see Section 5.1.4)\n\xef\x82\xb7 Excessively high temperature (see Section 5.4)\n5.1.5.1 Requirements \xe2\x80\x93 Thermal Runaway Propagation\na. For battery designs greater than a 80-Wh energy employing high specific energy cells\n(greater than 80 watt-hours/kg, for example, lithium-ion chemistries) with catastrophic\nfailure modes, the battery shall be evaluated to ascertain the severity of a worst-case\nsingle-cell thermal runaway event and the propensity of the design to demonstrate cell-tocell propagation in the intended application and environment.\nWorst-case thermal runaway events will include method and location of thermal runaway\ninitiation and environmental conditions. Thermal analysis that considers ohmic and\nentropic heating should be performed and validated by test.\nNASA has traditionally addressed the threat of thermal runaway incidents in its battery\ndeployments through comprehensive prevention protocols. This prevention-centered\napproach has included extensive screening for manufacturing defects, as well as robust\nbattery management controls that prevent abuse-induced runaway even in the face of\nmultiple system failures. This focused strategy has made the likelihood of occurrence of\nsuch an event highly improbable.\nThis requirement focuses not on the likelihood of such an event but rather on\nunderstanding the severity of consequences in the intended application should this\nunlikely event occur. Understanding the consequences of an event allows an informed\nrisk assessment and identifies potential mitigation via design or operations.\nb. The evaluation shall include all necessary analysis and test to quantify the severity\n(consequence) of the event in the intended application and environment as well as to\nidentify design modifications to the battery or the system that could appreciably reduce\nthat severity.\nIn addition to prevention protocols, programs developing battery designs with\ncatastrophic failure modes should take the steps necessary to assess the severity of a\npossible thermal runaway event. Programs should assess whether there are reasonable\ndesign changes that could appreciably affect the severity of the outcome.\nEvaluation should include environmental effects to surrounding hardware (i.e.,\ntemperature, pressure, shock), contamination effects due to any expelled contaminates,\nand venting propulsive effects when venting overboard.\n\n34\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n5.2\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nChemical Exposure Hazards\n\nBattery cells may contain and/or generate toxic and/or corrosive gases. Release of these\nchemicals and gases into the enclosed environment of a space vehicle would contaminate the air\nsupply and exposed surfaces, creating health hazards for personnel, operational problems for\nsurrounding hardware, and potential structural problems for surrounding facilities. Release of\nthese chemicals and gases external to a space vehicle also may contaminate a space suit and\ncreate a resulting human exposure hazard upon return to a habitable volume.\nElectrolyte leakage occurs during the unintended venting of electrolyte liquid and gases.\na. An assessment shall be made by a toxicologist on the level of toxicity associated with the\nvented products of the battery.\nIf the cell electrolyte is rated at toxicology level 2 or higher, the leakage hazard is\nconsidered catastrophic because at minimum exposure to eye tissue, it can cause\npermanent blindness. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and common lithium-ion electrolytes\nare typically toxicity level 2 risks.\n5.2.1 Chemical Exposure Sources \xe2\x80\x93 Mechanical Failure\n1. Rupture or structural failure of cell case during launch or use, permitting uncontrolled\nrelease of electrolyte and gases into the battery enclosure or beyond.\n2.

The seals of cell and battery designs shall be verified to work at worst-case mission\noperating conditions.\nDetermination of worst-case condition should consider any two credible failures, such as\nloss of external cooling or an unanticipated load up to the limit of designed circuit\nprotections, which may lead to off-nominal thermal conditions, to ensure the battery\n36\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\ndesign has adequate thermal management to keep cell and battery seals within their\noperating pressure and temperature limits.\nj.

Over-discharge of the battery beyond usable voltage levels caused by use beyond\nintended design, low temperatures that reduce battery capacity, failure controls that\ndegrade performance, etc.\n\n37\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n5.3.2.1 Requirements\na. Batteries employed as the sole source of energy for critical safety systems shall be\nassessed for loss-of-power hazard.\nIncorporation of design features intended to constrain battery operation in order to\noptimize battery health, should consider if the equipment the battery is powering is\ndeemed more critical than the battery health. The assessment should be used to determine\nthe appropriate level and number of features whose failure could cause loss of electrical\npower. If an off-nominal operation of the battery will be required for contingency,\nbattery safety should be assessed prior to further use. Battery health refers to factors\nthat reduce its performance or life.\n5.4\n\nExtreme Temperature Hazards\n\nExtreme battery temperatures can be hazards for the crew and ground personnel (touch\ntemperatures) and can be a failure source for chemical exposure and fire/explosion hazards.\nFrom a battery perspective, high temperature occurs when the operating temperature of a battery\nor cell exceeds the upper temperature limit of the manufacturer\'s performance specifications,\nleading to hazards found in other sections, such as chemical exposure, explosion, fire, and loss of\npower.\n5.4.1 Sources\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\n8.\n\nExternal heating from the environment and/or surrounding equipment.\nSustained short circuit/high discharge rates.\nSustained high charge rates.\nCell failure leading to thermal runaway and possible propagation to other cells in the\nbattery.\nFailure of battery heaters leading to uncontrolled high or low temperatures.\nFailure of an active cooling system.\nCharging lithium-ion type batteries at very low temperatures causing lithium metal\ndeposition that could subsequently lead to failures, including high temperatures, venting,\nand fire.\nImbalanced internal resistances caused by temperature variations within a battery leading\nto large imbalances and thermal gradients.\n\n5.4.2 Requirements\na. Battery thermal extremes shall be controlled during all mission phases to ensure that the\ncrew is protected from extreme touch temperatures.\nThe maximum allowable continuous touch temperature for surfaces in crewed spacecraft\nis 44 degrees Centigrade (\xc2\xb0C) (112\xc2\xb0F). Warning labels should be employed for surface\ntemperatures between 45 and 50\xc2\xb0C (113 and 122\xc2\xb0F), and should have protective\nmeasures above 50\xc2\xb0C (122\xc2\xb0F). The minimum touch temperature for surfaces in crewed\n38\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nspacecraft is 10\xc2\xb0C (50\xc2\xb0F). The requirements and guidelines in NASA-STD-3001 should\nbe consulted and followed.\nIf the battery or cell will not be directly touched but is located near a surface that will be\ntouched, temperature controls should be incorporated to prevent excessive battery or cell\nheat from transferring to the touchable surface.\nb. Battery thermal extremes shall be controlled and verified via test at worst-case mission\nenvironments to ensure that all cell temperatures remain within safe operating ranges\nspecified by the manufacturer or verified by tests.\nExcessive battery and/or cell temperatures can lead to battery and/or cell leakage,\nventing, or fire/explosion.\nThermal protective devices should be incorporated to protect batteries from going into a\nventing, fire, or thermal runaway condition. Some examples include: 1) thermally\nactuated circuit breakers or thermostats set to interrupt the load current before the cell\nand/or battery temperature reaches a hazardous temperature, 2) heat sinks, 3) heat\nshunts, or 4) active cooling loops in the battery to remove internally generated heat from\nthe cells and/or battery.\nBatteries should be installed such that they are isolated from potential external heat\nsources by thermal optimization of the on-board location of the battery to provide\nprotection from convective, radiative, or conductive heat sources.\nThermal analysis should be carried out to determine design characteristics that will\nminimize thermal gradients within a battery design.\nHeat sinks and heat dissipation and other thermal design features should be used to\nminimize sensible heating of the battery during operation as well as to minimize thermal\ngradients within the battery design to the degree necessary to meet mission requirements.\nc. External short circuits shall be controlled for the cells and battery assembly, as discussed\nin Section 5.1.3, to prevent heat generation resulting from high rates of discharge.\nd. Validated thermal analysis and testing shall be performed to confirm that the battery cells\nwill not be exposed to temperatures below the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s rating or the limit\nestablished by qualification tests.\nHeaters or equivalent devices and methods should be used if charging is required in\nthermal environments that are below the safe charging temperature of the battery.\ne. Thermal extremes due to thermal runaway propagation shall be addressed as discussed in\nSection 5.1.5.\nf. Battery heaters shall be designed with appropriate levels of failure tolerance to prevent\nexcessive heating of the battery and/or cells.\nWhere practical, the heater should be designed such that maximum heat input at\nmaximum environmental temperature would not result in any one cell exceeding the\nspecified maximum operating temperature. When this is not possible, redundant hightemperature cutoff thermostats should be used. Hardware controls are preferred over\nsoftware/firmware controls.\n\n39\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nThe effects of differential thermal expansion and contraction between dissimilar\nmaterials, such as plastic cell cases and metal battery cases, should be incorporated in\nthe verification of the battery design if the battery will experience significantly low or\nhigh temperatures from external or internal sources. For example, plastic cell cases\nshould not be "pinned" to a metal battery case by cement, hard potting, or mechanical\nmeans. Resilient filler material may be required inside the battery case to absorb\ndimensional changes resulting from thermal expansion/contraction changes. In\nprismatic cell designs, the battery case structure should be designed to withstand or\nnegate the stresses induced by cell swelling. The direction of cell swelling during\ndischarge varies for cell shapes and chemistries. Most prismatic cells swell in the\ndirection normal to the plane of their electrodes (flat face of cells).\n\n40\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n6.\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nSAFETY RELEVANT TO SPECIFIC BATTERY CHEMISTRIES\n\nBattery users frequently request a listing of batteries "approved" for use onboard crewed space\nvehicles. Since the safe use of a battery is partially application specific, there can be no such list.\nAny battery that can be made safe to fly in the crewed space vehicle environment can be used;\nhowever, there are some batteries that are not practical to make safe. For example, lithium-sulfur\ndioxide cells have built-in overpressure vents that will release SO2 (sulfur dioxide) gas and other\nelectrolyte components that are highly toxic; thus, these are unacceptable in the habitable area of\na space vehicle. However, that chemistry has been used safely in the non-pressurized areas of\ncrewed spacecraft. Note that the thrust possible from a cell/battery venting incident should be\naddressed for possible impacts to vehicle mission. When at all possible, it is better to build a\nbattery using a cell chemistry and cell design that is inherently safe on its own for space vehicle\nuse rather than applying extensive (and often costly) modifications to make an inherently\nunsuitable cell acceptable for crewed flight use.\nBatteries can be categorized into three main types: primary, secondary, and reserve. The primary\nbatteries are typically one-time usage types and are not capable of being charged after they are\ndepleted. The secondary batteries are those that can be recharged. The reserve batteries are\nthose in which the active materials are mixed just before use.\nThe following is a historical list of cell chemistries, both primary (nonrechargeable) and\nsecondary (rechargeable), which have been flown on crewed space vehicles.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAlkaline-manganese primary\nLeClanche (carbon-zinc) primary\nLead-acid secondary cells having immobilized electrolyte\nLithium/lithium-ion polymer secondary (including lithium-polymer variation)\nLithium metal anode primary cells having the following cathodic (positive) active\nmaterials:\nPoly-carbon monofluoride\nIodine\nManganese dioxide\nSilver chromate\nSulfur dioxide (external to habitable spaces only)\nThionyl chloride\nThionyl chloride with bromine chloride complex additive (Li-BCX)\nIron disulfide\nLithium sulfur\nMercuric oxide-zinc primary\nNickel-cadmium secondary\nNickel-hydrogen secondary\nNickel-metal hydride secondary\nSilver-zinc primary and secondary\n\n41\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nZinc-air primary\nSodium-sulfur secondary (external to habitable space)\nThermal batteries\n\nThere are additional battery chemistries that are emerging in commercial/industrial prominence.\nUse of these chemistries should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for use in crewed flight.\nOften the cells used in batteries for crewed space vehicle are commercially available. A special\n"government" purchase is not required for alkaline, zinc-air, and lithium coin cells; however,\nminimal screening tests are required of sample commercial cells to ensure the cells will perform\nin the required load and environment without leakage or failure (see Appendix A, Tables A-3\nand A-4). Specific certification tests may also be required of a battery depending on its\napplication and design. Often a certificate of compliance regarding manufacturing processes and\nshelf life data is required by Safety and Mission Assurance personnel responsible for certifying\nthe hardware, so designers are cautioned to inquire ahead of time regarding necessary\ndocumentation.\nTo ensure that cells are fresh for flight use, shelf-life limits from the date the cells are\nmanufactured have been established for the various chemistries. See Appendix C for more\ndetails on shelf and service life. Battery providers need to keep in mind that stowage of a cell\nwith a bypass diode across the cell/battery terminals can cause a slow drain of capacity of the\ncell, thus lowering the service life.\nRechargeable cells typically are stowed late to retain a good charge on the cells for flight use.\nRechargeable cells generally have a faster self-discharge rate than primary cells, so some launch\ndelays could force a hardware exchange with freshly charged cells or a recharge on the launch\npad (with prior approval). In cases where large nickel-hydrogen batteries will require charging\nin a space vehicle on the launch pad, consideration should be given to see that adequate cooling\nof the battery is available.\n6.1\n\nAlkaline Primary Batteries\n\n6.1.1 Definition\nAlkaline manganese dioxide cells were introduced in the early 1960\xe2\x80\x99s and have become the most\ndominant battery cell in use today. They have higher energy density, better service and shelf\nlife, and better resistance to leakage than the carbon-zinc cell. The cell is typically of a bobbin\n(or button) design.\nThe basic electrochemical processes taking place in these alkaline cells are:\nAnode:\n\nZn + 2 OH-\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nZn(OH)2 + 2 e-\n\nCathode:\n\n2MnO2 + H2O + 2 e-\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\n2MnOOH + 2 OH-\n\nThe overall reaction is: Zn + 2MnO2 + 2H2O\n\n\xef\x83\xa8\n\nZn(OH)2 + 2MnOOH\n\n42\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nThe anode is made up of zinc powder and the cathode of manganese dioxide powder. The\nelectrolyte is 35 percent KOH. The nominal voltage of alkaline cells ranges from 1.5 to 1.6 V,\nand most of their capacity is consumed when the voltage drops to about 1.0 V. The shelf life is\nbetween 8 to 10 years: however, due to the high tendency of leakage, they are not stored for\nmore than 3 years.\n6.1.2 Hazard Sources\nAs with any aqueous electrolyte, the cell can generate flammable mixtures of hydrogen and\noxygen. The KOH electrolyte is extremely caustic and can cause damage to eyes, skin, and\nmucous membranes, as well as corrosion of metals. In short circuit conditions, these cells can\nexceed touch temperature limits and swell to the point that removal from cylindrical constraints\nbecomes difficult.\n6.1.3 Controls/Process Requirements\na. The battery boxes used for alkaline cells should be vented and have a nonconductive\ncoating and absorbent material.\nb. Alkaline cells in sizes D or smaller with a maximum of 12 V and/or 60 Wh\n[Wh = Cell Capacity (Ah) \xc3\x97 Cell Voltage (V)] and with cells either all in series or all in\nparallel and with no potential charging source and with the cells located in a vented\ncompartment, should be listed on the JSC Form 1298 as they fall under the non-critical\ncategory.\nc. An EP-Form should be used to obtain approval for these batteries and presented along\nwith the respective safety data packages.\nd. The EP-Form should include cell product information, Underwriters Laboratory (UL)\nsafety test data, and a circuit schematic showing the safety circuitry (e.g., fuses, diodes,\netc.). In the absence of UL data and/or safety circuitry, testing should be performed to\nprovide this safety data.\ne. For cells and batteries listed in the above noncritical category (6.1.3.b), flight acceptance\ntesting should include vacuum leak checks with functional tests before and after. The\nvacuum exposure will be to approximately 0.1 psi for 6 hours for batteries used in\nhabitable environments.\nf. For batteries that do not fall within the above category, a complete engineering,\nqualification, and flight acceptance test program should be completed and a Unique\nHazard Report should be submitted.\ng. Alkaline cells should not be left in devices that are not operated for more than 1 year. If\ndevices will not be used for more than 1 year, the alkaline cells should be removed and\ndiscarded after each use.\nh. Alkaline cells that are partially used should not be stored and reused. Tracking of\nperformance for each cell is cost and time prohibitive; hence, they should be discarded in\ndry trash after each use.\n\n43\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n6.2\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nAlkaline Secondary Batteries\n\n6.2.1 Definition\nIn the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, "rechargeable" alkaline cells entered the commercial cell market.\nHistorically, alkaline cells have been used solely as primary, nonrechargeable cells. Alkaline\ncells being advertised as rechargeable are sold with a special charger that should be used,\nfollowing strict instructions, in order to achieve rechargeability. However, since their\nperformance and capacity is significantly less than alternative primaries, a comparison with a\nnickel-metal hydride battery design is advised before this option.\n6.2.2 Hazard Sources\nDue to the hazards associated with charging cells and the strict routine that should be followed\nfor processing these cells through charge/discharge cycles, flight hardware using "rechargeable"\nalkaline cells should be on a case-by-case basis. Since the commercial chargers typically lack\nthe type of fail-safe controls required for use of the hardware in the space vehicle environment,\nthe use of the commercial chargers should be restricted. A thorough evaluation of the charger\ndesign is required to identify the hazard controls inherent in the design, if any, and the missing\nhazard controls. The applicable hazards detailed in subsections of Section 4.0 should be\naccounted for in the design, especially controls concerning the hazards associated with gas\ngeneration, high temperature, and charging.\n6.2.3 Controls/Process Requirements\nThe controls from Section 5 are applicable here. In addition, the applicable controls detailed in\nsubsections of Section 5 should be accounted for in the design, especially controls concerning\nthe hazards associated with charging.\n6.3\n\nLead-Acid Batteries\n\n6.3.1 Definition\nThe practical lead-acid battery traces its origins to 1860 and is one of the few batteries with acid\nelectrolyte (battery acid). Since this battery generates hydrogen during charge and discharge and\non open circuit, the Vent Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) battery is not to be flown without a\nwaiver. The Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) battery cell is designed to contain any hydrogen generated\nwithin the cell case.\nThe half-reactions in a lead-acid battery are the following:\nAnode:\n\nPb\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nPb2+ + 2e-\n\nPb2+ + SO42-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nPbSO4\n\n44\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\nPbO2 + 4H+ + 2e-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nPb2+ + 2H2O\n\nPb2+ + SO42-\n\nCathode:\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nPbSO4\n\nPb + PbO2 + H2SO4 \xef\x83\xb3\n\n2PbSO4 + 2H2O\n\nThe anode in lead acid cells is made up of a sponge-like metallic lead, and the cathode is lead\ndioxide (PbO2) in both \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 forms. The \xce\xb1 form contributes to a higher cycle life, although it\nis slightly less electrochemically active and lower in gravimetric energy density. The electrolyte\nis sulfuric acid of about 37 percent by weight (approximately 2M H2SO4) and a specific gravity\nof 1.26 to 1.28 when fully charged.\nThe operating voltage of the cell is typically 2.0 to 1.75 V; however, the cell can be discharged\ndown to 1.0 V. Lead-acid cells are charged using a constant voltage protocol to 2.39 V, and\nbecause most of these are used as uninterruptible power sources, they should be kept fully\ncharged at a float voltage between 2.17 to 2.25 V, with this voltage being dependent on the\nnature of the anode and the specific gravity of the electrolyte. A shelf life of 7 years can be\nobtained if the cells are maintained at a float voltage when not in use.\n6.3.2 Hazard Sources\na. The traditional concerns with lead-acid batteries are hydrogen generation and loss of\nelectrolyte containment.\nb. This cell chemistry is capable of extremely high current rates, which could result in burns\nto the crew or overheating of improperly protected electronic components.\n6.3.3 Controls/Process Requirements\na. Appropriate absorbent materials should be used to contain any electrolyte vented from\nthe cells.\nb. Fusing components should be used to limit the maximum discharge capability of the\nbattery.\nc. All batteries should be two-fault tolerant to overcharge and external short hazards (see\nSections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3, respectively).\nd. All batteries should undergo engineering, qualification, and flight acceptance testing.\ne. Sample lot testing should be performed on 3 to 6 percent of every new lot of cells and\nbatteries procured for the same application.\n6.4\n\nLithium-ion Secondary Batteries\n\n6.4.1 Definition\nLithium-ion batteries are rechargeable batteries and have a high voltage cathode such as LiMO2\n(M = Co, Ni, Mn, Al, or combinations of these) or LiFePO4 (and derivatives of this olivine\nmaterial). The anode is usually a form of carbon or LiTi4O5 or lithium alloys of Si or Sn. The\n45\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nelectrolyte in these cells is made up of a combination of organic carbonates and a salt. The most\ncommonly used salt is LiPF6 (lithium hexafluorophosphate). Other salts such as LiBOB (lithium\nbisoxalato borate) or LiBF4 (lithium tetrafluoroborate) have also been used. The charge and\ndischarge in the lithium-ion cells occurs by the process of intercalation and deintercalation,\nrespectively, as shown in the equations below.\ncharge\n\nPositive\n\nLiMO2\n\nLi1-xMO2 + xLi+ + xe\n\ndischarge\ncharge\n\nNegative\n\n+\n\nC + xLi + xe\n\nLixC\n\ndischarge\ncharge\n\nOverall\n\nLiMO2 + C\n\ndischarge\n\nLixC + Li1-xMO2\n\nThe nominal voltage of lithium-ion cells is about 3.6 V, and the highest energy density obtained\nfrom a state-of-the-art cell is currently greater than 230 Wh/kg. The typical charging protocol\nfor the lithium-ion cells includes a constant current charge to a voltage of 4.1 V or 4.2 V\n(depending on the metal oxide cathode and manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations) and a hold at\nconstant voltage until the current falls down to approximately C/100 (this can vary according to\nthe manufacturer). Due to the unique charging characteristic of the lithium-ion cells and\nbatteries, charging should be performed with a dedicated charger only. This charger may be a\n\xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d charger in some cases. If a dedicated charger does not exist, the equipment used for\ncharging should have adequate controls so as to not impose an overcharge, overcurrent, or\novervoltage condition on the battery. The discharge of the cell depends on the load used, but the\nend voltage during discharge should not go below manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specified voltage. Typical end\nof discharge voltages for the batteries in different equipment has been 3.0 V/cell. Internal\nresistance for the lithium-ion cells varies from 80 to 120 m\xe2\x84\xa6 for low-capacity (1 to 3 Ah) cells to\nabout 0.8 m\xe2\x84\xa6 for high-capacity (190-Ah) cells.\nLithium-ion cells typically are spiral wound or prismatic. Under the prismatic types there are\ntrue prismatics, which are stacked flat plates, and others that are folded over to give a prismatic\nappearance. A third variety that is increasingly common in the market today is the elliptic\ncylindrical type, where the spiral wound stack is flattened to give a prismatic appearance.\nTypically, the commercial cells used in cellular phones are prismatic cells, while those used in\ncamcorders, cameras, and PCs are spiral wound cylindrical cells. Lithium-ion cells have\n100-percent energy efficiency through most of their cycle life (input energy is equal to output\nenergy). While commercial cylindrical cells are either case negative or case positive, most of the\nprismatic cells above 5-Ah capacity are either case neutral or case positive.\nCommercial cylindrical cells (e.g., 18650, 26650, etc.) have three levels of protection. These are\nthe PTC current limiters, current interrupt device (CID), and the shutdown separator. The PTC\ndevice is activated in the case of external short/overcurrent and over-temperature conditions.\nThe CID is activated when the cells build up excessive pressure that usually occurs when the\ncells are overcharged to voltages close to or above 5 V. The shutdown separator is activated\nwhen the cells reach a certain temperature that causes a meltdown of the middle polyethylene\n46\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nlayer of the three-layer separator. This usually occurs at about 130\xc2\xbaC (266\xc2\xbaF). Not all lithiumion cells have a shutdown separator. Commercial cell designs today have a ceramic-coated\nseparator that is expected to be more robust to shorting events. The cells also have a vent that is\nrated to vent above 150 psi. However, in most of the cell designs under discussion here, the\nshutdown separator and vent activate near or above the onset of thermal runaway temperatures\nand are not typically considered to be safety controls. Furthermore, venting of flammable gases\nwill result in flames, sparks, and fire in the presence of an oxygen atmosphere, which in a\nmajority of cases may evolve from cathode decomposition inside the cell.\nHigh-capacity cells consist of the shutdown separator, vents, and a fusible link to the electrode as\npossible levels of protection. The shutdown separator is activated when the cells reach\ntemperatures close to 130\xc2\xbaC (266\xc2\xbaF). The fusible link melts at specific current levels, which then\ninhibits any hazardous occurrences during an external short condition. The vent typically\noperates above 150 psi, and cells typically do not perform after a vent. These safety features are\nnot always effective at mitigating a safety incident.\nThe SOC and temperature at which the cells are stored or cycled greatly affects the irreversible\ncapacity loss in the cells. For example, one commercial cell in a period of storage for 1 year\nexhibited less than a 2-percent loss at 0-percent SOC and 0\xc2\xbaC, whereas it exhibited about\n13-percent loss at 100-percent SOC and 40\xc2\xbaC. The temperature and the DoD to which the cells\nare cycled also affect the deliverable capacity of the cells with cycle life.\n6.4.2 Hazard Sources\nThe main abuse conditions that cause hazards in lithium-ion cells are the result of overcharge,\ninternal and external shorts, and high temperatures. Although over-discharge is in itself not a\nhazard, it can cause development of high resistance and cell conditions that can subsequently\nlead to a hazard.\nStudies have shown that overcharge conditions can lead to the deposition of lithium metal that\ncan create internal shorts in the cell. The electrolyte in the lithium-ion cells contains flammable\norganic solvents, and under high voltage conditions they decompose, leading to the formation of\ngases (e.g., carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous decomposition products). This\ncan cause overpressure conditions inside the cell, leading to smoke and flame if the gases are not\nvented benignly. Rapid charging at temperatures below the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification can\nalso cause deposition of lithium dendrites. However, lithium dendrite formation can be\nmitigated if the charge current is lowered per the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification or is limited to\nless than full SOC.\nExternal short of lithium-ion cells of the high and low impedance types can also result in high\ntemperatures and pressures inside the cell, resulting in venting, fire, thermal runaway, and/or\nexplosions.\nThe lithium-ion cells under simulated internal short conditions have shown to exhibit venting,\nfire, and smoke, as well as thermal runaway. Simulated internal short tests can determine the\n\n47\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\ntolerance of particular cell designs to internal shorts. However, most lithium-ion cell designs\nhave been shown to be intolerant to internal shorts, especially at high SOCs.\nInternal shorts can occur in two ways. One is due to poor quality control in the cell\nmanufacturing process that causes impurities and contaminants to be present as latent defects\ninside the cell that can later pierce the separator, causing an internal short circuit that can result\nin electrolyte leakage, fire, and thermal runaway. This cause is mitigated by the DFMR\napproach specified herein. The second cause for this event results from abuse such as\novercharge and over-discharge or extreme temperatures. Internal shorts can occur when cells are\nused beyond their specifications, such as charge and discharge rates beyond the cell\xe2\x80\x99s capability,\nexceeding end-of-charge or end-of discharge voltages, and exceeding operational temperature\nranges. Such excesses can cause the deposition of metallic dendrites of copper and lithium.\nLocalized intense heat due to impurities or dendrite formation provides the environment for a fire\nin the presence of a flammable organic electrolyte. Aluminum metal current collector\ncontributes to the thermal runaway of a cell when internal temperatures reach the melting\ntemperature of aluminum (~660\xc2\xb0C). This second cause is to be controlled by a failure tolerance\napproach.\nOver-discharge conditions lead to the electrodeposition of copper on the anode, cathode, and\nseparator, causing the formation of a short circuit condition. Gas formation due to\ndecomposition of electrolyte under/over-discharge conditions have also been reported in the\nliterature [32, 33]. In most cases, over-discharge, even into reversal, is benign and results in a\nshorted (dead) cell. However, subsequent charges of multi-cell modules with one or more cells\nthat experience over-discharge can cause other cells to go into an overcharge condition. The\ntolerance of a cell to over-discharge conditions (voltage, etc.) should be characterized for battery\ndesigns before safety controls are set.\nLithium-ion cells under very high temperature conditions [above 150\xef\x82\xb0C (302\xef\x82\xb0F)] can vent,\nsmoke, and exhibit thermal runaway accompanied by fire and/or an expulsion of can contents\nthrough the vent holes in the cell or through the bursting of the cell header.\n6.4.3 Controls/Process Requirements\na. As with all rechargeable crewed spacecraft batteries, lithium-ion secondary batteries\nshould include design features and operational protocols to provide failure tolerance to\nmisuse and off-nominal operating conditions beyond cell manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s and/or verified\nvoltage, current, temperature, and life limits.\nb. Engineering and qualification testing of lithium-ion batteries and cells, lot certification,\nacceptance testing, and screening of flight batteries should be performed on all batteries\nthat do not fall under the noncritical category (guiding documents include EP-WI-015,\nEP-WI-031, and JSC 66548.)\n\n48\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n6.4.3.1 Engineering Evaluation, Development, and Design\nCOTS Applications\na. In the case of COTS lithium-ion batteries, features that should be characterized for the\nbattery include the fuse rating; the operational characteristics (voltage) of the overcharge,\novercurrent, and over-discharge protection switches; and the details of operation of the\nprotective circuitry.\nb. For lithium-ion batteries of the COTS type, less than 12 V and up to 60 Wh, test data\nshould be provided to show at least single-fault tolerance. The second level of control\nshould be supported with existing test data or manufacturer data.\nc. Batteries of the COTS type, less than 12 V and up to 60 Wh, should be from a single lot,\nand the battery safety circuitry should be provided for review with the evaluation package\nand hazard report.\nd. For all lithium-ion button cells, the cell specification, UL safety test data, and the safety\ncircuitry should be provided for evaluation and inclusion with the standardized hazard\nreports.\nCustom Designs\na. The lithium-ion batteries should undergo performance and abuse tests at the cell and\nbattery level as part of the engineering evaluation test program.\n1. The performance tests should include, as a minimum, physical characterization\n(i.e., dimensions and weight), electrochemical characterization (i.e., OCV, closed\ncircuit voltage (CCV), internal resistance/impedance, capacity checks), mission\nprofile performance, and vacuum leak checks.\n2. The abuse tests should consist of, as a minimum, overcharge, over-discharge,\nexternal short (i.e., low and smart impedance (an impedance necessary to draw\ncurrent just below the current limiter designed limit)), internal short/crush, heatto-vent, vibration, drop, and vent and burst pressure determination.\n3. Some of the features that should be characterized for the battery are the fuse\nrating, the operational characteristics (voltage) of the overcharge and overdischarge protection switches, and the details of operation of the protective\ncircuitry.\nb. Safety devices incorporated into the cell, if any, should be tested and documented (e.g.,\nPTC devices, CIDs, shutdown separator, etc.).\nc. For custom-designed batteries, cell voltage monitoring consistent with 4.4.3 should be\nprovided.\nd. For custom-designed batteries, battery-level current monitoring consistent with 4.4.3\nshould be provided for all phases of a mission from ground testing to return and landing.\ne. For large custom-designed batteries (greater than 12 V and 60 Wh), thermal analyses\nshould be carried out to determine the battery design and configuration that would\n49\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nprovide the optimum heat dissipation and the least thermal gradient over the entire\nbattery (recommended range of <3 \xc2\xb0C).\nf. For custom-designed batteries, temperature monitoring consistent with 4.4.3 should be\nprovided based on high-fidelity thermal analysis to determine the optimum number of\nthermal sensors required to monitor and protect the batteries for nominal and off-nominal\nconditions.\nBattery Charging\na. Charging and other ground and flight operations should not impose any hazards on the\nbattery pack that is being charged.\n1. Lithium-ion batteries should be charged with a dedicated charger or a universal\n\xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d charger that recognizes the battery chemistry via the use of unique\nelectrically erasable programmable read-only memory or equivalent method of\nidentification. In the event that a dedicated charger is not used or an alternative\ncharging method is used, adequate controls should be in place to prevent any one\ncell or a battery pack from going into an overvoltage, overcurrent, or overcharge\ncondition.\n2. The charger, charging equipment, charge circuitry, or charging protocol should be\nevaluated under normal operating conditions to understand its characteristics and\nverify its safety.\n3. It should be verified that the battery charging equipment (if not the dedicated\ncharger) has at least two levels of control that will prevent it from causing a\nhazardous condition on the battery being charged.\n4. The COTS chargers, if used to charge the batteries on-orbit, should be from a\nsingle lot, and charger circuitry should be provided with the standard hazard\nreport for review and approval.\n5. The overcharge controls should be consistent with the dissimilar redundancy\nrequirements of Section 4.\n6.4.3.2 Qualification Testing\na. For COTS lithium-ion button cells of up to 300 mAh capacity, a standard hazard report\nused for non-critical batteries with UL safety test data is sufficient for documentation of\nthe battery.\nLithium-ion button cells of up to 300 mAh capacity that cannot be removed from the\nequipment (e.g., cell soldered to circuit board) may be qualified at the end-item level.\nb. The pass/fail criteria for the recheck of the functional baseline should be set stringently to\ndetermine any failures, including subtle failures due to cell internal manufacturing\ndefects.\nFor example, COTS battery programs use a less-than-0.5-percent change in OCV and\nmass and a less-than-3-percent capacity change as pass/fail criteria.\n\n50\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n6.4.3.3 Acceptance Testing\na. All flight cells and batteries should undergo acceptance testing that includes, as a\nminimum, verification of battery performance to mission requirements by\ncharge/discharge cycling, vibration, and vacuum leak checks.\nb. Acceptance testing should include a minimum of 10 charge/discharge cycles to screen for\nlatent defects and infant mortalities. The required number of cycles can be achieved\nusing the total of cycles performed at the vendor, during cell acceptance screening, at\nsub-battery assembly, and at the completed assembly level.\nc. The vibration levels and spectrum used to screen the qualification and flight batteries for\nthe occurrence of internal shorts should be higher than what is obtained from the\ncalculation of mission requirements (Appendix A).\nd. In the event that cell-level controls are used as safety controls, irrespective of the cell size\nand design, test data should be provided to prove that these devices are effectively\nworking as designed in the flight lot of cells.\ne. For custom battery designs, the flight lot of cells should be 100-percent visually inspected\n(e.g., corrosion, bulging, scratches, dents and deformations, misaligned seals, electrolyte\nleakage, contaminants in the seal, etc.).\nf. For custom battery designs made of small-capacity, high-volume commercial cells, the\nflight lot of cells should be acceptance screened to remove \xc2\xb13-sigma outliers for the\nfollowing minimum performance parameters: OCV, mass, dimensions, DC internal\nresistance and/or AC impedance, leak check, charge and discharge capacity, and charge\nor voltage retention. (For large lot sizes of cells, dimensional screening can be performed\nusing \xe2\x80\x9cgo/no-go\xe2\x80\x9d jigs or gauges.) Cells with temporary discrepancies should be rejected.\nEP-WI-031 can be used for cell acceptance testing of lots of lithium-ion cells. To ensure\nonly lots with adequate performance uniformity pass, after removing outlier cells, the\nresultant \xc2\xb13*\xcf\x83 range for the following parameters as a percentage of the mean\n(\xc2\xb13-sigma range/mean) should not exceed the following:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nOCV (<1%)\nMass (<2%)\nCapacity (<5%)\nDC and AC resistance (<15%)\n\nIf the total number of cells that fail the acceptance screening criteria is greater than\n15 percent of the lot, then the lot is rejected.\nThe following flow takes advantage of the low cost of high-volume commercial cells and\nassumes a large quantity of cells within the sample set that can be screened down to flight\nset. In addition, this flow imposes a uniformity requirement such that the 6-sigma range\n(\xc2\xb13-sigma range width) is narrow by requiring that it be less than a percentage of the\nmean. These strict uniformity requirements may not be suitable for large-capacity cell\ndesigns, as these are often lower volume, and uniformity is often not as tight as on the\nsmaller, high-volume commercial cells.\n\n51\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nCells subjected to\nstatistical analysis based\non mass, OCV, capacity,\nac/dc impedance- Do\nstatistics on one\nparameter\n\nOutliers\noutside of +/- 3\nsigma\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nIs lot uniformity\ncritera 6 sigma %\nof mean met?\n\nRemove\noutliers\nand assess if std\ndev would be\nimproved by\nanother\npass\n\nNO\n\nReject Lot\n\nYES\n\nRepeat for\nnext\nparameter\n\nNO\n\nALL PARAMETERS\nCOMPLETE\n\nCell Matching\nand Flight\nBuild\n\nNO\n\nTotal Quantity of\nRejects > 15% of\nEntire Lot?\n\nYES\n\nFigure 6.4.3-1.

As a result, the\ncell matching that follows becomes a formality.\nIn the event that large-capacity, lower volume cells are planned for the flight build, a\ndifferent flow may be more suitable, as generally there are fewer cells to work with at the\nbeginning of the screening. In this case, additional screening iterations may not be\npossible with the limited number of high-cost cells involved.

For custom batteries, the \xe2\x80\x9cas received\xe2\x80\x9d cell OCV measurement is an excellent screen for\nidentifying charge retention (soft short) outliers if the time between the last time the SOC\nwas set and the measurement is made is over 1 year. If that time delay is not possible,\nthen one method for screening cells with soft shorts is to deeply and slowly discharge the\ncells to 0-percent SOC at the lowest operational constant voltage set by the manufacturer\nand observe the bounce-back of the OCV over a 14-day period. Declining OCVs from a\nmaximum over the 14-day stand can be indicative of a soft short and pass/fail criteria\nshould be set accordingly.\ni. For custom battery designs, 100 percent of the flight batteries should undergo acceptance\nscreening that includes visual inspection, OCV, mass, dimensions, DC internal resistance,\nvibration to higher levels (Appendix C), and leak check with charge and discharge\ncapacity checks before and after the vibration check. The pass/fail criteria should be\nstringent in order to recognize subtle failures or defects and should be based on the\nresults of the qualification test program.\nj. For COTS battery designs, 100 percent of the flight batteries should undergo acceptance\nscreening that should remove \xc2\xb13-sigma outliers in the following minimum performance\nparameters: visual inspection, OCV, mass, dimensions, DC internal resistance, leak\ncheck, and charge and discharge capacity. The flight acceptance tests should include, as\na minimum, baseline physical and electrochemical tests, vibration to relevant levels\n(Appendix C) and vacuum leak checks with baseline physical and electrochemical tests\nperformed before and after the vibration and vacuum leak checks. The pass/fail criteria\nshould be stringent. For example, COTS battery programs use less than 1-percent change\nin OCV and mass and less than 3-percent capacity change as pass/fail criteria. If greater\nthan 3 percent of the lot fails, then the lot is rejected.\nFor COTS lithium-ion button cells of up to 300 mAh capacity, flight cells should undergo\nacceptance testing that includes functional and vacuum leak checks.\nLithium-ion button cells that cannot be removed from the equipment (e.g., cell soldered to\ncircuit board) may be functionally checked at the end-item level.\n\n54\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nBatteries undergo physical characterization\n(visual inspection, dimensions, mass),\nelectrochemical characterization (OCV, CCV,\ncapacity); stringent requirements for physical\nand electrochemical characterizations are\nprovided\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nNo. of cells\npassing is\n> 97%\n\nYES\n\nFlight battery\nacceptance testing: stringent pass/\nfail criteria (change between pre\nand post test results for tests such\nas vibration and vacuum should\n<0.5 % OCV and mass,\n<5% capacity)\n\nFAIL\n\nReject\nBattery\n\nYES\n\nFly Battery\n\nFigure 6.4.3-3. COTS Battery Acceptance Flow\n\n6.5\n\nLithium/Lithium-ion Polymer Secondary Batteries\n\n6.5.1 Definition\nLithium/lithium-ion polymer batteries are rechargeable batteries and have polymer blends in the\ncathode or anode or separator or in all three. In the polymer cells, flat, bonded electrodes are\nused to enable the fabrication of thin cells. The cells could be made in flexible shapes and sizes\nand packaged in aluminized plastic pouches. Although the commercial market labels all polymer\nbatteries as \xe2\x80\x9clithium-polymer\xe2\x80\x9d batteries, most of those in the market today are of the lithium-ion\npolymer type. These are called lithium-ion polymers as they contain electrode formulations and\nsome liquid electrolyte that are similar in composition to lithium-ion cells and do not contain a\npurely polymeric electrolyte or lithium metal electrode.\nThe electrochemical nature of these cells is very similar to the liquid electrolyte lithium-ion cells\ndealt with in the previous section. These cells have a LiMO2 cathode (M = Co, Ni, Mn, or\ncombinations of these). The commonly used cathodes in lithium/lithium-ion polymer cells are\nLi-Mn2O4 spinel compounds. The anode can be any form of carbon, namely, natural and\nsynthetic graphites, mesophase carbon micro beads (MCMB), or carbon fibers (lithium-ion\n55\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\npolymer cells). The anode can also be lithium metal (lithium polymer cells). The electrolyte in\nthese cells is made up of a combination of organic carbonates and a salt in a polymer matrix.\nThe most commonly used salt is LiPF6 (lithium hexafluorophosphate). The polymers commonly\nused are based on polyacrylonitriles (PANs), PVDF-based polymers (PVDF-HFP, PVDFCTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), etc. In some cases, an ancillary plasticizer such as dibutyl\nphthalate is incorporated into the resin, which facilitates the densification of the electrodes under\nlow temperature and pressure. The plasticizer is later vaporized or removed by a suitable solvent\nextraction process. The charge and discharge in the lithium/lithium-ion cells occurs in a manner\nsimilar to that described in Section 6.4.\nThe nominal voltage of the lithium-ion polymer cells with the cobaltate cathode is about 3.6 V\nand the energy density obtained can range from 145 to 190 Wh/kg. The lithium-ion polymer\ncells with the manganese spinel cathode have a nominal voltage of about 3.8 V and have energy\ndensities in the range of 130 to 144 Wh/kg. The typical charging protocol for the\nlithium/lithium-ion polymer cells includes a constant current charge to a voltage of 4.1 V or\n4.2 V (depending on the metal oxide cathode and manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations) and held at\nconstant voltage until the current falls down to approximately C/100 (this can vary according to\nthe manufacturer). Due to the unique charging characteristic of the lithium-ion cells and\nbatteries, charging should be performed with a dedicated charger only. This charger can be a\n\xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d charger in some cases. Lithium polymer cells may sometimes require higher\ntemperatures for operation (about 60 \xc2\xbaC (140 \xc2\xbaF)). The discharge of the cell depends on the load\nused, but the end voltage during discharge should not go below 2.5 V. Typical end-of-discharge\nvoltages for the batteries in different equipment have been 3.0 V/cell. Internal resistance for the\nlithium-ion polymer cells varies from 20 to 60 m\xce\xa9 for small (0.5 to 15 Ah) cells and is expected\nto drop with increased capacity cells.\nLithium/lithium-ion polymer cells are typically flat and thin. The cells are packaged in vaporimpermeable, flexible, multilayer metalized polymer bags. The polymer cells are typically made\nup of a positive electrode plate and a negative electrode plate bonded to two opposite sides of an\nionically conductive separator. The plates can be stacked as individual plates, Z-folded, or\nfolded in other ways depending on the mechanical properties of the individual component layers.\nA large-capacity cell would thus have several plates stacked on each other to give the capacity\nrequired. Another common method of cell stacking is the \xe2\x80\x9cbicell\xe2\x80\x9d configuration, where the\ncentral plate (typically a negative electrode) is shared by two positive plates on either side.\nThere is a layer of separator between the center negative plate and the two positive plates on\neither side. Several bicells can be stacked to give a larger capacity cell.\nPolymer cells typically perform well at low rates of charge and discharge. However, cells can be\nmade for specific medium and high rate applications. Because of the higher resistance caused by\nthe polymer materials used in the electrodes and separator, currently, a small quantity of liquid\nelectrolyte is added to improve ionic conductivity.\nThe SOC and temperature at which the cells are stored or cycled greatly affects the irreversible\ncapacity loss in the cells. These are similar to the liquid lithium-ion cells.\n\n56\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nThe polymer cells do not have the same safety features that a liquid lithium-ion cell would have.\nThe only safety feature in the cell is the shutdown separator that works in a manner similar to\nthat of the liquid systems. With the polymer cells, due to the nature of the cell design and\npackage, the cell seals lose integrity under abusive conditions, leading to electrolyte leakage.\nBut, due to the presence of very little electrolyte compared with the liquid cells, the hazards\nassociated with them are less. The presence of the gel polymer can cause a self-healing process\nin instances of nail penetration in a fully charged state and hence reduces the occurrence of\nexplosions or fires.\n6.5.2 Hazard Sources\nThe main abuse conditions that cause hazardous conditions in lithium/lithium-ion polymer cells\nare the result of overcharge, internal and external shorts, and high temperatures. These are\nsimilar to those for the liquid lithium-ion cells, discussed in Section 5.4. However, the polymer\nlithium-ion cells have additional problems with electrolyte leakage under abusive conditions and\ncorrosion of polymer pouches. These pouch-design cells are also intolerant to vacuum\nconditions and undergo swelling.\n6.5.3 Controls/Process Requirements\nThe controls for the polymer cell batteries are similar to those for the lithium-ion liquid systems.\nThe battery should be failure tolerant to overcharge, over-discharge conditions, external short\n(high and low impedance), and extreme temperature hazards. Although an over-discharge\ncondition has not been deemed to be a hazard in lithium-ion cells, subsequent charges can cause\na hazardous condition in one or more cells in a multi-cell pack. The controls and processes listed\nin Sections 5 and 6.4 (lithium-ion) should be used as applicable to incorporate safety controls\ninto the battery design.\nIn addition, the following should be taken into account while using the lithium-ion polymer cells.\na. The lithium-ion polymer cells should be tested in an environment of 8 to 10 psi pressure\nfor the flight acceptance leak test rather than the vacuum (~0.1 psi) or deep vacuum\n(~10\xe2\x80\x935 Torr). In addition, the pouch cell designs should be leak tested with the pressure\nrestraints on the wide faces of the cells to prevent damage due to pouch expansion. The\nrestraint pressure should be obtained from the cell manufacturer. The cells should be\nrestrained at all times to prevent inadvertent swelling during storage, cycling, and low\npressure or vacuum environments.\nb. Cells should be stringently monitored for any signs of voltage decay, visual evidence of\nexternal corrosion, or inadequate isolation of the terminals from the pouch.\n\n57\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n6.6\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nLithium Primary Batteries\n\n6.6.1 Definition\nLithium batteries of the primary or nonrechargeable type are of several different chemistries. In\nmost cases, primary lithium cells have a lithium metal anode. Cells of this chemistry have a\nnonaqueous electrolyte that is either organic or inorganic in nature. Depending on the cathode\npresent, the nominal voltage of the cell differs. The most commonly used lithium primary\nbatteries for space applications are lithium manganese dioxide (Li-MnO2), lithium iron disulfide\n(LiFeS2), lithium polycarbon monofluoride (LiCFx), lithium thionyl chloride (Li-SOCl2), and\nlithium bromine chloride complex (Li-BCX). The less commonly used ones are lithium sulfur\ndioxide (Li-SO2) and lithium sulfuryl chloride (Li-SO2Cl2).\nThe half-cell reactions, chemistry, and operating voltage details are provided below for the most\ncommonly used lithium primary batteries.\nThe half reactions for the Li-MnO2 cell chemistry are:\nAnode:\n\nLi\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nLi+ + e-\n\nCathode:\n\nMnIVO2 + Li+ + e-\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nMnIIIO2(Li+)\n\n\xef\x83\xa8\n\nMnIIIO2(Li+)\n\nThe overall reaction is: Li + MnIVO2\n\nThe cathode is made up of solid heat treated MnO2, and the electrolyte is a mixture of propylene\ncarbonate or butylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane, along with a salt such as lithium\nperchlorate or lithium trifluoroethylacetate (triflate). The OCV of this cell chemistry is 3.3 V.\nThe nominal or operating voltage of the cell is 3.0 V. Caution should be exercised in using cells\nwith an OCV greater than 3.3 V. Higher voltages accelerate corrosion and lead to significant\nreduction in the calendar life of the battery.\nThe half reactions for the Li CFx are:\nAnode:\n\nxLi\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nxLi+ + xe-\n\nCathode:\n\n(CF)x + xe-\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nxC + xF-\n\nThe overall reaction is: xLi + (CF)x\n\n\xef\x83\xa8\n\nxLiF + xC\n\nThe cathode is solid polycarbon monofluoride, and the electrolyte is a mixture of gammabutyrolactone with a salt such as lithium tetrafluoroborate. In coin cells, dimethoxyethane is also\nadded to the solvent mixture. The OCV is 3.2 V, and the operating voltage is between 2.5 to 2.6\nV, which drops down further under higher loads. Voltage delays are common with this\nchemistry, especially at low temperatures, and predischarge is typically performed to remove this\nfeature.\nThe half reactions for the LiFeS2 are:\nAnode:\n\n4Li\n\n4Li+ + 4e\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n58\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nCathode:\n\nFeS2 + 4e\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nFe + 2S2\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nThe overall reaction is: 4 Li + FeS2 \xef\x83\xa8\n\nFe + 2Li2S\n\nThe cathode is a solid iron disulfide (FeS2), and the electrolyte is a mixture of organic solvents\nsuch as dimethoxyethane and dioxolane and a salt such as lithium iodide. The OCV of the cells\nis as high as 1.9 V, and its nominal voltage is 1.5 V. The operating voltage range is from about\n1.6 V to 1.0 V, and the cells are capable of providing up to a C rate discharge.\nThe half reactions for the Li-SOCl2 cell are:\nAnode:\n\nLi\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nLi+ + e-\n\nCathode:\n\n2SOCl2 + 2e-\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nSO2 + S + 4Cl-\n\nThe overall reaction is: 4Li + 2SOCl2\n\n\xef\x83\xa8\n\n4LiCl + SO2 + S\n\nThe catholyte is a mixture of thionyl chloride and lithium aluminum tetrachloride on highsurface-area carbon. The OCV is 3.7 V, and the nominal operating voltage for the former is\n3.5 V.\nThe half reactions for the Li-BCX cell are:\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nAnode:\n\nLi\n\nCathode:\n\n2SOCl2.BrCl + 2e- \xef\x83\xa0\n\nThe overall reaction is: 6Li + 2SOCl2.BrCl \xef\x83\xa8\n\nLi+ + eSO2 + S + 3Cl2 + Br2\n4LiCl + SO2 + S + 2LiBr\n\nThe catholyte in Li-BCX cells is a mixture of thionyl chloride (SOCl2), lithium aluminum\ntetrachloride, and bromine chloride (BrCl), with a SOCl2 to BrCl ratio of 6:1. The OCV for\nLi-BCX is approximately 3.8 to 3.9 V, with an operating voltage of 3.6 V.\n6.6.2 Hazard Sources\nLithium batteries have very high energy densities compared with other batteries, as shown by\nTable 6.6.2-1.\nTable 6.6.2-1.

Some of these conditions are:\n59\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\na. Any condition that results in the lithium anode reaching its melting point of 180\xc2\xb0C\n(356\xc2\xb0F) is a hazardous condition. Discharging lithium cells at a high rate produces heat;\ntherefore, a lithium battery must be designed to safely remove that heat. High\ntemperatures can also be caused by an external heat source, an external short circuit, or\nphysical abuse (e.g., crushing or penetration by a sharp object) that results in an internal\nshort or a manufacturing defect resulting in an internal short.\nb. Discharging a cell until its voltage falls to 0 volts and then overdischarging the cell by\nforcing it into negative voltage, whether by cells in series with it or by another power\nsupply, can result in cell rupture and/or explosion.\nc. Charging lithium cells can result in cell rupture and/or explosion. Parallel combinations\nbetween cells, batteries, and power sources may force a charging current through a stack\nof cells containing a weak or dead cell.\nd. A toxicity hazard is presented by certain lithium cells that contain a pressure relief vent.\nCell overpressurization under certain abuse conditions may release such toxic gases as\nsulfur dioxide, thionyl chloride, and/or hydrogen chloride, depending on the type of\nlithium battery, into the space vehicle environment. Batteries with an electrolyte toxicity\nof level 4 should not be used in the habitable environment (irrespective of size) of a space\nvehicle. Examples of such battery chemistries are lithium-sulfur dioxide, lithium-sulfuryl\nchloride, lithium-thionyl chloride, and Li-BCX.\ne. Internal shorts due to manufacturing defects and/or contamination.\n6.6.3 Controls/Process Requirements\na. Lithium primary batteries should be failure tolerant to inadvertent charge, over-discharge\ninto reversal, external shorts, and high temperatures.\nb. All primary lithium batteries greater than 300 mAh capacity should be tested for\ntolerance to internal shorts using simulated internal short tests (see internal shorts).\nThose that are intolerant to internal shorts (i.e., they exhibit leakage, venting, explosion,\nor fire) should undergo a higher vibration screening before flight.\nc. Lithium cell and battery temperatures should be controlled such that the temperature\nduring operation remains below the manufacturer\'s stated upper temperature limit, for\nexample, 71\xc2\xb0C (159.8\xc2\xb0F) for Li-BCX. Testing should be done to verify safe performance\nat the operating temperature limits if the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommended limits will be\nexceeded for any application.\nd. Thermal sensors, switches, or fuses set to open at the appropriate temperature should be\ninstalled in batteries containing lithium primary cells if the temperature of the battery is\nexpected to exceed its safe rating.\ne. Both external and internal heat sources should be controlled in the battery design, as\ndetailed in Section 5 on high temperatures.\nf. Overcurrent protection devices, such as fuses or circuit breakers, should be provided for\nlithium cells regardless of whether or not the cells have self-contained fuses. Protective\n60\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\ndevices should be rated above the highest likely load current but should have a low\nenough rating to prevent any form of external short circuit on the cell or battery. See\nSection 4.5 for more details on short circuit protection.\ng. Wherever more than one lithium cell is used in series, each cell in the series string should\nhave redundant parallel bypass diodes attached to them so that the diodes become\nconductive at the smallest possible negative voltage in order to provide over-discharge\nprotection (see Figure 6.6.3-1). Overcurrent devices, such as fuses or PTCs, should be in\nseries to the cells to prevent bypass diode failures from causing external short hazards in\nthe cells. In selecting a shunt diode for the battery design, strive for the least negative\nvalue.\nh. Button cells with a capacity less than 300 mAh, which are used as backup power sources\nfor computer memories, clocks, etc., may use a high-value resistor to limit a potential\ncharging current.\n\nFigure 6.6.3-1. Fuse and Diode Protection of a Cell\n\ni. If the battery design utilizes parallel strings of cells to obtain the desired current, each\nstring should contain redundant blocking diodes in series with each string of cells.\nBatteries that are in parallel with external power sources should be equipped with chargecurrent blocking devices (see Figure 6.6.3-2). (The blocking diodes as shown below\nprovide redundancy for both safety and mission success if a diode fails open or shortcircuited. For just safety, only two blocking diodes in series are required.)\n\n61\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nFigure 6.6.3-2. Redundant Parallel Blocking Diodes for each Series String in a Parallel-Series\nBattery Combination\n\nj. Primary lithium button cells, such as Li-(CF)x, Li-iodine, Li-V2O5, and Li-MnO2, which\nhave a capacity of 300 mAh or less and no more than three cells per common circuit, and\ncells that are not in a gas-tight compartment fall under the non-critical category and\nrequire the cell specification, UL test data, and the safety circuitry for review and\napproval on a EP-Form. The cells should be acceptance-tested under vacuum conditions\nwith weight checks, visual inspection, and open-circuit and closed-circuit voltage checks\nbefore and after the leak check.\nk. All other batteries that do not fall under the non-critical category should undergo\nengineering, qualification, and flight acceptance tests for each unique application.\nl. All flight batteries that do not fall under the non-critical category should undergo\nacceptance testing that includes visual inspection and testing for OCV, closed-circuit\nvoltage, vibration to flight requirement levels or higher (Appendix A), and vacuum leak\nchecks with weight and voltage measurements performed before and after each test.\nm. All inorganic electrolyte lithium primary cells should be verified to have undergone\nX-rays at the cell manufacturing facility.\nn. All the DFMR measures against cell internal shorts that are required for and mentioned in\nprevious sections for lithium-ion (and that don\xe2\x80\x99t involve cycling) should be applied to\nlithium primary batteries.\n6.6.4 Certification Requirement for Handling Lithium Batteries\nPersonnel who handle lithium batteries or cells at JSC are required to be certified per the Center\nrequirements under provisions of JPR 1700.1I, \xe2\x80\x9cJSC Safety and Health Handbook.\xe2\x80\x9d A training\nclass is offered through the Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance Office at JSC. After\n62\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nsuccessful completion of this class, personnel are certified for 12 months. The class must be\nrepeated every year to maintain certification. Additional training in lithium battery handling is\noffered through the Energy Systems Test Area (ESTA). The content of this training is provided\nin ESTA-OP-0-49 Rev E, \xe2\x80\x9cLithium Battery Handler Certification.\xe2\x80\x9d Although lithium primary\nbatteries should be handled safely, they do not require to be classified by the quality standards\n(e.g., they need not be always treated as Class I or Class II hardware) unless they are flight or\nqualification units.\n6.6.5 Application of UL Data\nThe UL conducts abuse tests on several models of lithium cells. Cells that pass the abuse tests\nreceive UL recognition (distinct from approval) by cell number. The UL test data can be used as\na reference during battery review to determine whether adequate hazard controls have been\nincorporated in a lithium battery design. The use of UL safety test data does not indicate that\nsafety controls are not required.\n6.6.6 Prepackaged Multi-celled Batteries\nThe use of prepackaged lithium batteries containing more than one cell should still contain the\nnecessary hazard controls. Modification of the prepackaged batteries may be required in order to\nincorporate the hazard controls into the final battery design.\n6.7\n\nNickel-Cadmium Batteries\n\n6.7.1 Definition\nWhile charging, nickel-cadmium cells produce a voltage with a gradually rising slope. When the\ncells are fully charged, the voltage begins to increase its rate of rise and then drops off due to the\ninverse relationship of voltage and temperature in nickel-cadmium cells. This peak in the\nvoltage curve is readily detected, normally on the negative slope, and the chargers are designed\nto use this to terminate the charge. Alternatively, nickel-cadmium battery charging may be\nterminated on the basis of an upward break in the temperature curve. A timed cutoff is\nrecommended as a backup for charge termination.\nThe half reactions for the nickel-cadmium chemistry are:\nAnode:\n\nCd + 2OH-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nCd(OH)2 + 2e-\n\nCathode:\n\nNiO2 + 2H2O + 2e-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nNi(OH)2 + 2OH-\n\nThe overall reaction is: Cd +NiO2 + 2H2O\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nCd(OH)2 + Ni(OH)2\n\nThe cathode in the nickel-cadmium cell is made up of nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), and the\nanode is made up of cadmium hydroxide [Cd(OH)2]. The electrolyte is 45 percent by weight of\nKOH, which is approximately 6 M concentration. The OCV of nickel-cadmium cells can be as\nhigh as 1.55 V, their nominal operating voltage is 1.2 V, and they are typically discharged down\nto 1.0 V per cell.\n63\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n6.7.2 Hazards\nSince nickel-cadmium cells undergo both charge and discharge, the battery hazards detailed in\nsubsections of Section 5 should be accounted for in the battery design, especially the hazards\nassociated with gas generation, high temperature, and charging. While nickel-cadmium cells are\ndesigned to recombine gases produced during nominal charging conditions, these battery types\nhave pressure relief vents set at 200\xe2\x80\x93300 psia. This vent is often a resealable type. There are\nwelded seal aerospace-type nickel-cadmium cells without a vent, and these cells are generally\nused on open-frame designs.\n6.7.3 Controls/Process Requirements\na. The controls detailed in the subsections of Section 5 should be incorporated for nickelcadmium batteries.\nb. The charge should be terminated by voltage slope and temperature sensing or by a rigid\ncutoff time with either voltage slope or temperature sensing.\nc. The charger should be tested under conditions representing the nominal operational\nmode, as well as under reasonable abuse scenarios (i.e., overcharge) for the intended\napplication. The tests should verify the successful operation of the charge termination\nmethod.\nd. Nickel-cadmium batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity fall under the non-critical\ncategory, and a Form 1230 for payloads is sufficient for documentation of the battery.\ne. Nickel-cadmium batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity should undergo\nacceptance testing that includes visual, functional, and vacuum leak checks. For those\nthat cannot be removed from the equipment, a functional check along with UL safety test\ndata should be supplied.\nf. In all cases, the cell specification and the safety circuitry should be provided with the\nstandardized hazard reports.\ng. COTS nickel-cadmium batteries of up to 20 V and 60 Wh for IVA use can be listed on\nthe Form 1230, and the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification, the battery protective features, and\ncharger schematics should be provided to support two-fault tolerance to all catastrophic\nhazards.\nh. All other batteries that do not fall under Section \xe2\x80\x98g\xe2\x80\x99 should undergo engineering,\nqualification, and flight acceptance tests for each unique application.\ni. Lot testing should be performed on 3 to 6 percent of every new lot of cells and batteries\nprocured for the same application\nj. All flight nickel-cadmium cells and batteries that do not fall under \xe2\x80\x98g\xe2\x80\x99 should be from a\nsingle lot and should undergo open-circuit and closed-circuit voltage tests, vibration, and\nvacuum tests, with functional charge/discharge cycles performed before and after each\ntest.\n\n64\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n6.8\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nNickel-Hydrogen Batteries\n\n6.8.1 Definition\nNickel-hydrogen batteries utilize essentially the same positive electrode and electrolyte as\nnickel-cadmium cells and a platinum catalyst negative electrode. This battery does not suffer a\nfate similar to other nickel-based cells if overcharged or if over-discharged into reversal. Nickelhydrogen batteries exhibit maximum performance between \xe2\x80\x9310\xc2\xb0C and 0\xc2\xb0C with performance\ndropping off sharply above 30\xc2\xb0C. Operational life exceeding 60,000 low Earth orbit (LEO)\ncycles and more than 15 years of geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) cycling has been obtained\nin satellite use. The expense of this battery generally dictates its use.\nThe half reactions for the NiH2 are:\nAnode:\n\n1/2 H2 + OH-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nH2O + e-\n\nCathode:\n\nNiOOH + H2O + e-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nNi(OH)2 + OH-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nNi(OH)2\n\nThe overall reaction is: NiOOH + 1/2 H2\n\nThe anode in NiH2 cells is the hydrogen electrode, which is hydrogen gas in a compressed state\nand a Teflon bonded platinum black catalyst that is supported on a photo-etched nickel substrate.\nThe cathode is similar to the other nickel chemistries and is composed of nickel hydroxide\nimpregnated on a porous nickel sintered plaque. The electrolyte is concentrated KOH, but it\nvaries in concentration depending on the application. The concentration of KOH in a fully\ndischarged cell used for LEO applications ranges from 26 to 31 percent, and from 31 to\n38 percent in those used for GEO applications. The nominal voltage for this battery chemistry is\n1.2 V.\n6.8.2 Hazard Sources\nThe principal hazard associated with nickel-hydrogen batteries is the high-pressure hydrogen in\nfully charged cells, 800\xe2\x80\x931,000 psia. Internal pressure is directly proportional to the relative\nSOC. These cells are welded seal, leak-before-burst designs without relief valves and can\ntypically found in open-frame battery designs.\n6.8.3 Controls/Process Requirements\nThe nickel-hydrogen cell container is considered a thin-walled pressure vessel and should be\ndesigned and certified to leak before burst to ensure that breaching the container does not result\nin release of shrapnel. Special arrangements need to be made well in advance of launch of any\nnickel-hydrogen battery that will require crew handling. See Section 5.1.1.1 for requirements for\npressure vessels.\n\n65\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n6.9\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nNickel-Metal Hydride Batteries\n\n6.9.1 Definition\nNickel-metal hydride cells became commercially available in the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s as replacements\nfor nickel-cadmium cells. In part this was sparked by new limits on the allowable cadmium in\nthe manufacturing work place. Nickel-metal hydride cells typically provide up to twice the\ncapacity for the same size nickel-cadmium cell and experience less of the "memory effect"\ncharacteristic of nickel-cadmium cells. The voltage and discharge parameters of both\nchemistries are sufficiently similar to allow the interchange of nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal\nhydride cells for discharge purposes. However, the intricacies of the charge characteristics of\nnickel-metal hydride cells differ enough from the nickel-cadmium cells that nickel-cadmium\nchargers cannot be safely used to charge nickel-metal hydride cells in the habitable environment\nof a spacecraft.\nThe half reactions for the nickel-metal hydride are:\nAnode:\n\nMH + OH-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3 M + H2O + e- (M = metal alloy)\n\nCathode:\n\nNiOOH + H2O + e- \xef\x83\xb3 Ni(OH)2 + OH-\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n\nNiOOH + MH\n\n\xef\x83\xb3 Ni(OH)2 + M\n\nThe cathode is nickel oxyhydroxide, and the anode is typically one of two types of metallic\nalloys. One such alloy is the Misch metal type that is made up of rare earth alloys of lanthanum\nnickel (LaNi5) known as the AB5 class, and another is made up of titanium and zirconium known\nas the AB2 class. Substitutions of the Misch metal alloys can be made with Ce, Nd, Pr, Gd, and\nY in the place of La. In the case of AB2 types, major substitutions by the use of V, Ti, and Zr\nprovide improved hydrogen storage. Other metal substitutions are made in both cases to\nsuppress corrosion that would result in longer life. The electrolyte is typically 30 percent by\nweight of KOH. The OCV for the nickel-metal hydride is similar to the nickel-cadmium and is\napproximately 1.55 to 1.6 V. The nominal or operating voltage of the cell is 1.2 V, and the cell\nis discharged down to 1.0 V.\nNickel-metal hydride cells exhibit a gradually rising slope to the discharge curve while charging.\nHowever, the negative slope at completion of charge is not as significant as with nickel-cadmium\ncells. The negative slope may go undetected, especially at the lower charge rates, forcing the\ncells into overcharge. For this reason, chargers designed strictly for nickel-cadmium batteries\ncannot be used to charge nickel-metal hydride cells and/or batteries. The nickel-metal hydride\ncharger should be designed to terminate the charge on a characteristic other than the negative\nvoltage slope in addition to the negative voltage slope. Chargers designed specifically for\nnickel-metal hydride cells often terminate charge when the voltage changeover time is zero.\nAlternatively, the charge is terminated on the basis of an upward break in the temperature curve.\nA timed cutoff is recommended as a backup for charge termination.\n\n66\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n6.9.2 Hazards\nSince nickel-metal hydride cells undergo both charge and discharge, the battery hazards detailed\nin subsections of Section 5 should be accounted for in the battery design, especially the hazards\nassociated with gas generation, high temperature, and charging. While both are designed to\nrecombine gases produced during nominal charging conditions, these battery types have pressure\nrelief vents set at 200\xe2\x80\x93300 psia. This vent is often a resealable type.\n6.9.3 Controls/Process Requirements\na. The controls detailed in the subsections of Section 5 should be incorporated for nickelmetal hydride batteries.\nb. The charge should be terminated by voltage slope and temperature sensing or by a rigid\ncutoff time with either voltage slope or temperature sensing.\nc.\n\nThe charger should be tested under conditions representing the nominal operational\nmode as well as under reasonable abuse scenarios (i.e., overcharge) for the intended\napplication. The tests should verify the successful operation of the charge termination\nmethod. An example of acceptance and lot testing of cells is provided in EP-WI-014 B.\n\nd. Nickel-metal hydride batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity fall under the noncritical category, and a Form 1230 is sufficient for documentation of the battery for\npayloads.\ne. Nickel-metal hydride batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity should undergo\nacceptance testing that includes functional and vacuum leak checks.\nf. For nickel-metal hydride batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity that cannot be\nremoved from the equipment, a functional check along with UL safety test data should be\nsupplied.\ng. In all cases, the cell specification and the safety circuitry should be provided with the\nstandardized hazard reports.\nh. COTS nickel-metal hydride batteries of up to 20 V and 60 Wh for IVA use can be listed\non the Form 1230, and the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification, the battery protective features,\nand charger schematics should be provided to support two-fault tolerance to all\ncatastrophic hazards.\ni. All other batteries that do not fall under the Section \xe2\x80\x98h\xe2\x80\x99 should undergo engineering,\nqualification, and flight acceptance tests for each unique application.\nj. Lot testing should be performed on 3 to 6 percent of every new lot of cells and batteries\nprocured for the same application.\nk. All flight nickel-metal hydride cells and batteries that do not fall under \xe2\x80\x98g\xe2\x80\x99 should be\nfrom a single lot and should undergo open-circuit and closed-circuit voltage tests, with\nvibration and vacuum tests with functional charge/discharge cycles performed before and\nafter each test.\n\n67\n\nJanuary 2014\n\n6.10\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nSilver-Zinc Batteries\n\n6.10.1 Definition\nAlthough silver-zinc batteries have limited cycle life, they are frequently used because of their\nhigh energy density, for example, in the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU).\nThe half reactions are:\n\nCathode:\n\nZn\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nZn2+ + 2e-\n\nZn2+ + 2OH-\n\nAnode:\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nZn(OH)2\n\n2AgO + H2O + 2e-\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\nAg2O + 2OH-\n\nAg2O + 2H2O + 2e- \xef\x83\xb3\nThe overall reaction is: Ag2O + Zn + H2O\n\n\xef\x83\xb3\n\n2Ag + 2OHZn(OH)2 + Ag\n\nThe anode is a zinc electrode supported by a silver or copper current collector. The cathode is\nsilver oxide on a silver grid that serves as the current collector. Silver is in its pure metallic form\nduring discharge and is converted to silver (II) oxide (AgO) at the end of full charge. An\nintermediate product that is formed is silver (I) oxide or monovalent silver oxide (Ag2O). The\nelectrolyte is KOH with an optimum concentration of 45 percent, which is corrosive and can\ncause burns on the skin and damage to equipment. The OCV for a silver-zinc cell is typically\n1.86 V at room temperature.\n6.10.2 Hazard Sources\nThe main safety concern is electrolyte leakage. It should be noted that if it is necessary to top off\nthe electrolyte, one should add only electrolyte and not water, as water alone will lead to\ndegradation of the cell separator.\n6.10.3 Controls/Process Requirements\na. The controls associated with electrolyte leakage, as discussed in subsections of Section 5,\napply.\nb. Cells with free electrolyte and that generate gases even while at open circuit, such as in\nsilver-zinc, should be designed with a relief valve in line with the vent port with liquid\nabsorbent material to allow "burping" of gases but to trap liquid electrolyte, especially\nduring the atmospheric pressure changes, which occur with launch and reentry.\nc. Battery cases, such as those for silver-zinc batteries, should have redundant pressure\nrelief valves. The relief valve on the cell itself can be used as one level of control,\nwherever applicable.\nd. Cell vents in silver-zinc cells should be made out of noncorrosive or corrosion-resistant\nmaterials. A cell vent made of metallic materials could possibly contribute to the\nformation of shorting paths. In addition, corroded vents can easily plug up, contributing\nto an energetic release of gases and electrolyte.\n68\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\ne. For silver-zinc batteries that have a relatively low pressure relief valve, whenever\npossible during prelaunch stowage, the batteries should be oriented "upright" relative to\nthe launch gravity-vector so that any free electrolyte will be forced by the earth\'s gravity\nand the launch acceleration into the cell away from cell seals or vents.\nf. Silver-zinc batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity fall under the non-critical\ncategory, and a Form 1230 for payloads is sufficient for documentation of the battery.\ng. Silver-zinc batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity should undergo acceptance\ntesting that includes visual, functional, and vacuum leak checks.\nh. For those silver-zinc batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity that cannot be\nremoved from the equipment, a functional check along with UL safety test data should\nbe supplied.\ni. In all cases, the cell specification and the safety circuitry should be provided with the\nstandardized hazard reports.\nj. For those batteries that have capacities above 300 mAh and that are rechargeable,\nacceptance test cycles should be performed on the flight batteries.\nk. COTS silver-zinc batteries of up to 20 V and 60 Wh for IVA use can be listed on Form\n1230, and the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification, the battery protective features, and charger\nschematics should be provided to support two-fault tolerance to all catastrophic hazards.\nl. All other batteries that do not fall under \xe2\x80\x98h\xe2\x80\x99 should undergo engineering, qualification,\nand flight acceptance tests for each unique application.\nm.

All flight silver-zinc cells and batteries that do not fall under \xe2\x80\x98g\xe2\x80\x99 should be from a single\nlot and should undergo open circuit and closed circuit voltage tests, with vibration and\nvacuum tests with functional charge/discharge cycles performed before and after each\ntest.\n6.11\n\nZinc-Air Batteries\n\n6.11.1 Definition\nZinc-air batteries have a high energy density since the bulk of the cell contains only one of the\nreactants: zinc. Oxygen from the air is required to complete the chemical reaction that produces\nvoltage from a zinc-air cell. The zinc-air battery should therefore contain air holes to let oxygen\nin, yet should also be sealed to prevent the leakage of electrolyte. Using gas permeable, liquid\nimpermeable material to cover the air holes makes this possible. To prevent voltage loss during\nstorage due to self-discharge reactions, the battery design should include an air barrier over the\nair holes (i.e., battery inside a bag or gas impermeable material placed over the air holes).\nRemoval of the air barrier when the battery is to be used will activate the cells by allowing air\ninto the cell reactions. In addition to these guidelines for zinc-air batteries, the following hazards\nmust also be considered.\n\n69\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n6.11.2 Hazard Sources\na. Hydrogen gas is generated by the chemical reaction between the KOH electrolyte and the\nzinc anode. The hydrogen generation rate is 0.01 cc hydrogen/hr/gram of zinc for 0.5\npercent mercury amalgamated zinc at 21.1\xc2\xb0C (70\xc2\xb0F), based on silver-zinc chemistry. The\nhydrogen generation rate doubles or halves with each 10\xc2\xb0C increase or decrease,\nrespectively, in temperature (corresponding to a doubling or halving for every 18\xc2\xb0F\nincrease or decrease). The discharge rate also affects the rate of hydrogen generation.\nb. Zinc-air cells and battery cases require air holes in order to provide an access port for\noxygen, a necessary reactant of the chemical reaction, which produces current. The air\nholes are a potential leak point for the KOH electrolyte. KOH is a strong base that can be\ncaustic to eyes, mucous membranes, and skin and corrosive to most metals. In addition\nto the air holes, another potential leak point is the gasket between the two parts of the cell\ncan. Also, charging zinc-air primary cells may cause cells to rupture, releasing the\nelectrolyte.\nc. Other causes for hazards for zinc-air cells include short circuits, circulating currents, high\ntemperature, and charging. The details of these hazards are contained in their respective\nsubsections of Section 5.\n6.11.3 Controls/Process Requirements\na. Accumulation of generated hydrogen gas should be minimized by providing vents in the\nbattery. The air holes, which bring oxygen to the cells, can also serve as vent holes for\ngenerated hydrogen.\nb. If a ventilated zinc-air battery is installed inside another container, the second container\nshould also have a relief vent for hydrogen.\nc. The air holes in zinc-air should be covered with a material, such as Gore-Tex\xc2\xae fabric,\nwhich is permeable to air but impermeable to the electrolyte.\nd. The battery case, potting material, and case sealants should be made of materials that are\ncompatible with the strong base potassium hydroxide electrolyte.\ne. The zinc-air battery design should have controls for short circuits, circulating currents,\nhigh temperature, and charge prevention as detailed in their respective subsections of\nSection 4.0.\nf. Zinc-air batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity fall under the non-critical category,\nand a Form 1230 for payloads is sufficient for documentation of the battery.\ng. Zinc-air batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity should undergo acceptance testing\nthat includes visual, functional, and vacuum leak checks.\n\n70\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nh. For those zinc-air batteries and cells of up to 300 mAh capacity that cannot be removed\nfrom the equipment, a functional check along with UL safety test data should be\nsupplied.\n6.12\n\nLithium-Sulfur\n\n6.12.1 Definition\nLithium-sulfur (Li-S) is a rechargeable battery chemistry that has been researched and improved\nin the past decade. Although the theoretical energy density of this battery chemistry is at\n2,500 Wh/kg, the practical energy density at 400 Wh/kg is still the highest achievable for any\nrechargeable battery chemistry. This type of battery chemistry would offer tremendous savings\nin mass. However, due to the decomposition products formed during the charge/discharge\nprocess, the cycle life of this chemistry at this time is extremely limited. The half-reactions for\nthe lithium-sulfur chemistry are the following:\nAnode:\n\nS8 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S8 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S6 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S4 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S3\n\nCathode:\n\nLi2S \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S2 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S3 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S4 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S6 \xe2\x86\x92 Li2S8 \xe2\x86\x92 S8\n\nThe anode of the lithium-sulfur cell is made up of lithium metal, and the cathode is liquid sulfur.\nThe electrolyte is made up of dioxolane and a salt such as bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide).\nThe cell is initially made up of a solid sulfur cathode. which goes into solution when charged. At\nthe anode, lithium is dissolved during discharge and plates out on the anode during charge. The\nsulfur (S8) cathode combines with lithium to form Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S3, Li2S2, and Li2S. The\nhigher polysulfides, such as Li2S8, are present at the higher states of charge. The lower\npolysulfides, such as Li2S, are present at the lower states of charge. The operating voltage range\nfor the lithium-sulfur cell is between 2.5 to 1.7 V.\n6.12.2 Hazards\nThe hazards associated with lithium-sulfur cells are similar to most other lithium-based\nrechargeable battery chemistries. Under abuse conditions such as overcharge and external short,\ndue to the presence of a flammable electrolyte and lithium metal the cells can vent and burn until\nall the electrolyte and active material has been consumed.\n6.12.3 Controls\na. Lithium-sulfur cells should be two-fault tolerant to overcharge, over-discharge into\nreversal, external short, and high temperatures.\nb. Lithium-sulfur cells should be screened for internal shorts using the vibration method.\nc. All lithium-sulfur batteries should undergo engineering, qualification, and flight\nacceptance tests for each unique application.\nd. Qualification testing should include vibration to a higher level as for cells intolerant to\ninternal shorts.\n71\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\ne. Lot testing should be performed on 3 to 6 percent of every new lot of cells and batteries\nprocured for the same application.\nf. All flight lithium-sulfur cells and batteries should be from a single lot and should undergo\nopen-circuit and closed-circuit voltage tests, vibration to a higher level for cells intolerant\nto internal shorts, and vacuum tests with functional charge/discharge cycles performed\nbefore and after each test.\ng. All lithium-sulfur cells should be transported in a discharged state.\nh. All lithium-sulfur cells should be transported in metallic shipping containers and packed\nwith noncombustible materials. They should be individually bagged in plastic bags to\nprevent any short circuits.\ni. All lithium-sulfur cells should be visually inspected before removing from shipping\ncontainers.\nj. Lithium-sulfur cells that are warm to the touch should be allowed to cool to room\ntemperature. If the cells do not cool down, they should be placed in mineral oil to\nneutralize the active materials in the cell.\nk. Lithium-sulfur cells should always be stored at temperatures between 0 and 30\xc2\xb0C.\nl. Lithium-sulfur cells should be discharged in the temperature range of \xe2\x80\x9320 to 45\xc2\xb0C.\nm. A lithium-sulfur cell fire should be extinguished by smothering with copper powder or\nwith a Lith-X fire extinguisher and should not be disturbed for a minimum of 24 hours.\n6.13\n\nThermal Batteries\n\n6.13.1 Definition\nThermal batteries are a form of reserve batteries and are used extensively in applications that\nrequire an indefinite stand time and long life. They are used in mines, missiles, nuclear weapons,\netc., where they have to perform on demand. They are used in applications that require an\nextremely reliable battery that can withstand extreme environmental stresses such as shock and\nspin. The battery, once activated, performs at a very high rate for a very short time, typically on\nthe order of a few minutes. The batteries are activated by using a current pulse or by laser\nactivation methods. The most commonly used thermal battery is of the lithium iron disulfide\ntype, which has lithium as the anode and iron disulfide as the cathode. The electrolyte is a\ncombination of lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and magnesium oxide.\nAlthough the basic unit of the battery chemistry is about 1.5 V, thermal batteries are made with\nthe appropriate stacks of electrodes to provide the voltage desired. The diameter and thickness\nof the electrodes determines the capacity of the battery, and the capacity is typically provided by\nthe discharge life time rather than in ampere-hours. Hence, thermal batteries of different\nvoltages as well as capacities can be manufactured.\n\n72\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n6.13.2 Hazards\nThe hazards associated with thermal batteries are due to the high energies that can be released\nwithin very short periods. Hazards are associated with inadvertent charge, over-discharge into\nreversal, external short circuits, crush, high temperatures during storage, as well as inadvertent\nactivation of the batteries.\n6.13.3 Controls\na. Thermal batteries should be failure tolerant to inadvertent charge, over-discharge into\nreversal, external short circuit, and high temperatures.\nb. Thermal batteries should be X-rayed to eliminate the presence of metallic or activate\nmaterial particles in the cell stack.\nc. The welded seal of the thermal batteries should be maintained after exposure of the\nbattery to 90 psig for one hour at room temperature.\nd. The voltage of the batteries when measured for less than 30 seconds prior to initiation\nshould not exceed 3 mV. The measurement should be taken with an instrument with a\nminimum of 6 MOhm input resistance and less than 100 picofarads of input capacitance.\ne. The insulation resistance of the battery when measured using 100 +/\xe2\x80\x93 5 Vdc, prior to\ninitiation, between the terminal and case or between the initiator terminal and either the\npositive or negative or between the positive and negative terminals should be greater than\n20 MOhms. Caution should be exercised during this test to avoid measurements between\nthe two initiator terminals, as this would cause inadvertent activation of the battery.\nf. Flight acceptance testing should include tests from \xe2\x80\x9cc\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ce\xe2\x80\x9d on all flight batteries, as\nwell as vibration to higher than typical levels for those intolerant to internal shorts.\n6.14\n\nCapacitors/Supercapacitors\n\nTraditional capacitors and supercapacitors are used in several applications as alternate energy\nsources (in the place of or in conjunction with batteries) for space use. Capacitors do not have\nthe same hazards as batteries, but with the advancement in capacitor technology and the\ninvention of asymmetric as well as lithium-ion supercapacitors, the hazards associated with the\nuse of capacitors as alternate energy sources may not remain the same as those of EEE parts,\nespecially when used in a human-rated space environment.\nFor traditional capacitors and supercapacitors used as alternate energy sources, a destructive\nanalysis should be carried out to determine if any excess electrolyte is present. In the absence of\nexcess electrolyte and if the toxicological assessment indicates a toxicity rating lower than 2,\nthen only open-circuit voltage measurements need to be recorded on flight units and requires\ndocumentation. In the presence of excess electrolyte (electrolyte droplets visually observed or\nobtained by centrifuging or squeezing electrodes) or if the toxicity rating is 2 or higher, then a\nsafety assessment similar to that of batteries should be carried out.\n\n73\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nAsymmetric capacitors should undergo an assessment similar to that of batteries and depending\non the chemistry, the relevant battery chemistry requirements and processes should be used. For\nexample, lithium-ion supercapacitors should be treated in a manner similar to lithium-ion\nbatteries.\nCapacitors that are used in a non-\xe2\x80\x9calternate energy source\xe2\x80\x9d application as standard circuit-boardlevel components (example \xe2\x80\x9cEEE part\xe2\x80\x9d applications) and that are non-electrolytic, do not contain\nfree/excess electrolyte, and are not of the asymmetric or lithium-ion type are not subject to the\nguidelines recommended herein. Documentation of the safety of these components are verified\nvia nominal hardware testing and acceptance processes used for EEE parts.\n\n74\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\n7.

Determination of the qualification and certification test\nplan is achieved via inputs from the battery evaluation process, the intended application, and the\nprogram (i.e., shuttle or station) requirements. Typical testing includes functional checkout\n(i.e., operational, cycle), environmental (i.e., vibration, thermal, thermal vacuum),\nelectromagnetic compatibility, power quality, or others as deemed appropriate for the specific\nhardware and application. The vibration spectrum varies depending on the cell chemistry and\ntolerance of the cell to internal shorts. The safety tests that are required to prove two-fault\ntolerance to catastrophic hazard should be performed as part of a qualification test program and\nrepeated for each newly purchased lot of the same battery. The flight cell and battery packs that\nform the flight lot can go into the flight acceptance testing after the qualification test has been\nsuccessfully completed.\nA.1\n\nQualification Vibration Testing (QVT) for Batteries Tolerant to Internal Shorts\n\nThe purpose of the QVT for those batteries that are tolerant to internal shorts is to demonstrate\nthe ability of the component to withstand the stresses and accumulated fatigue damage resulting\nfrom the maximum random vibration environment.

The production control document should define\nthe procedure for defining impurities and the material specifications and inspections.\nStringent configuration control should be implemented. It is advised that an independent\nanalysis of incoming raw materials be carried out.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nQuality control documents, material specifications with impurity level specifications,\nincoming goods inspection documentation, supplier batch impurity analysis\ndocumentation, and periodic third-party audits of the supplier\xe2\x80\x99s certificates of analyses\nfor, at a minimum, the components of the active electrode materials, electrolyte (or\ncomponents of the electrolyte), separator, insulators, and any safety components.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nThe audit should confirm that the manufacturer is adhering to approved definition of cell\nlots.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nConfiguration control process. This is essential when a particular project would not be\nable to accept changes to the baseline cell design due to the nature and criticality of the\napplication. Configuration control is applicable to custom cell designs and should be\nachieved with documentation that enables traceability to all tools, fixtures, machines,\ninstruments, settings, environmental conditions, contaminant control, and pass/fail\ncriteria for the production of a unique cell design. Configuration control can also be\ndefined as documentation that demonstrates a solid chain of custody from incoming\nmaterials to final assembly and vice versa.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nParticulate and contaminant control documents and inspection of processes, and the\nmethods used to minimize contaminants. These environmental audits should verify that\nmagnets, adhesive tapes, and vacuum extraction are employed along with documentation\nof particle count and equipment calibration. The manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s procedure for collection\nof loose material produced during the production process should be audited. Metal-onmetal contact and other sources of contamination should be minimized near cell\nproduction processes up through cell closure. Examples of expected housekeeping\nmeasures to prevent contamination include dedicated or disposable footwear, hair caps,\nand lab coats, along with disposable gloves for all personnel in cell production areas up\nthrough cell closure. In addition, air pressure, as used in air knifes and air showers, is an\neffective alternative method to control mobile contaminants. It is important to control all\ncontaminants in the vicinity of electrode manufacturing process before they become\nembedded into the electrode coatings, as visual inspection of final product will not\nidentify embedded contaminants if these processes are not followed.

For simplicity, single cells\nand multi-cell packs will be described as batteries. Both parameters are dependent on the battery\nchemistry. Both parameters should be specified while obtaining safety certification for the cells\nand batteries used for each unique application. The shelf life and service life vary depending on\nwhether the batteries are primary (nonrechargeable) or secondary (rechargeable).\nThe shelf or calendar life is described as the life of the battery wherein its components (internal\nand external) have been, historically and by test, proven to be stable and safe. This is provided\nby the cell or battery manufacturer. The shelf life of batteries is affected by factors such as\nenvironment and usage. Usage in environments beyond the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation can\ncause irreversible damage to the batteries, lowering their shelf life. Table C-1 provides the shelf\nlife for the various chemistries. The shelf life of primary batteries should not be extended, as the\ncomponents of the cell are manufactured to meet only the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s stated shelf life. For\nrechargeable batteries, this shelf life can be extended by carrying out cycle life testing, as this\ndata will provide adequate evidence of the robustness of the cell components. This testing\nincludes performing at least five charge and discharge cycles. If at least 90 percent of the\nrequired performance is obtained from the batteries, the life of the battery can be extended for\n2 years, and if at least 80 percent of the required performance is obtained, then the life can be\nextended for 1 year. At the end of this period, testing can be repeated to extend the life again,\nuntil the battery is incapable of meeting the minimum performance requirements levied by the\nproject.\nTable C-1. Shelf life of Commonly Used Cell/Battery Chemistries\nChemistry\nLi-BCX, Li-SOCl2, Li-SO2Cl2,\nLi-SO2, Li-MnO2, LiCFx\nLi-FeS2\nAlkaline\n\nShelf life\n10 years\n15 years\n8 years (in freezer storage); 3\nyears at ambient\n30 to 45 days wet life\n5 years\n3 years\n3 years\n\nAg-Zn primary\nLi-ion (liquid), NiMH, NiCd\nLi-ion (polymer)\nAg-Zn rechargeable\n\nThe service life is the performance a battery can provide in a certain application. This is also\naffected by factors such as environment and usage. For example, exposure to long periods of\nhigh temperatures will cause the batteries to exceed performance at the beginning of life due to\nthe lowered internal resistance at high temperatures but will reduce their service life rapidly due\nto the decomposition of active materials. The service life depends on the application and the\nbattery capacity. For a primary battery, the capacity of the battery should be chosen to provide\nthe required period of performance. For example, if a primary battery is required to power a\ndevice continually, then the load on the battery and the period it is expected to provide that\npower should be taken into consideration to determine the size (capacity) of the battery. When\nobtaining battery certification, both the load and the period of use that reflects the service life\n85\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nrequired will have to be provided. For rechargeable batteries, apart from the capacity factor, the\nservice life is provided as cycle life, or the number of times it can be recharged. This is\ndependent on the battery chemistry. For example, some rechargeable silver-zinc batteries have a\nmaximum cycle life of 30 cycles unless specified otherwise by the battery manufacturer. Nickelmetal hydride, nickel-cadmium, and lithium-ion (liquid electrolyte systems only) have a cycle\nlife of greater than 500 cycles. Lithium-ion batteries have been shown to provide from one\nthousand to tens of thousands of cycles in portable equipment and satellite systems, respectively.\nThe service life of both primary and rechargeable may exceed the calendar life of the battery,\nand in those cases the calendar life becomes the limiting factor.\n\n86\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nAPPENDIX D: BATTERY DESIGN EVALUATION AND APPROVAL\nThe process by which battery design and usage plans are reviewed and approved varies with\neach Center and from program to program. This appendix will be used to collect examples of\nprocesses used within example programs. It is merely intended as guidelines of how the\napproval process can be conducted.\nD.1\n\nExample JSC Processes\n\nBattery approval should be provided via a signed battery evaluation form (e.g., ISS_EP-03 for\nNASA Safety Panels). The only exception to this is in cases where the battery is the main power\nsupply for a space vehicle that is designed and flown by a prime contractor. In this case, the\nresponsible battery safety expert should verify that the design is safe through the appropriate\nsafety panel review processes. Approval of a battery design for a particular hardware or mission\nwill not be construed as a general certification for all hardware and missions. Approval of\nbattery usage should be obtained for any new application of any approved hardware\nconfiguration and/or with each increase in scope of its certification. The process for obtaining\nbattery design evaluation and approval from JSC is detailed in JWI 8705.3. The safety review\nprocess for the ISS and all the visiting vehicles is described in SSP 30599. The safety review\nprocess for the Commercial Crew and Cargo Program is described in the CCTS-1140 and\nCCTS-1130 documents. The Payload Safety Review policy and data submittal requirements are\nprovided in NSTS 1700.7B (ISS Addendum) and NSTS/ISS 13830.\n\n87\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nJSC 20793 Rev C\n\nAPPENDIX E: REQUIREMENTS MATRIX\nRequirement\nNumber\n1.1\n\n1.3\n\n4.1.1a\n\nRequirement Language\n\nSection\n\nEvaluation of the design and verification program results\nshall be completed prior to certification for flight and\nground operations.\nTo be compliant to the requirements herein, every battery\ndesign, along with its safety verification program, its\nground and/or on-orbit usage plans, and its post-flight\nprocessing shall be evaluated and approved by the\nappropriate technical review panel in the given program\nor project.\nBattery systems for crewed spacecraft shall implement\nfailure tolerance as the preferred approach to control all\ncatastrophic hazard causes.\n\n4.1.1b\n\nThe level of failure tolerance shall be the product of an\nintegrated design and safety analysis but shall be a\nminimum of one.\n\n4.1.2a\n\nThe DFMR approach shall be used to address\ncatastrophic battery hazards that cannot practically be\ncontrolled by a failure tolerance approach\n\n4.2.1a\n\nAll cell and battery designs considered for flight shall\nfirst undergo evaluation testing to characterize the\nperformance and safety of the flight battery design.\n\n4.2.1b\n\nEvaluation testing shall, at a minimum, consist of\ncharacterizing the cell and battery safety under abuse\nconditions of overcharge, over-discharge into reversal,\nexternal short circuit and cell internal short circuit,\ntemperature tolerance, vent and burst pressure\ndetermination and for custom batteries (greater than 20\nWh), cell destructive physical analysis.\nEvaluation testing shall confirm manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s\nspecifications that are relevant to the project, as well as\nconfirm that the cell and/or battery design can handle\nunique requirements levied by the project.\n\n4.2.1c\n\n4.2.2a\n\nQualification testing shall be performed to the worst-case\nrelevant flight environments with margin.\n\n4.2.2b\n\nEnvironmental tests shall include, at a minimum, extreme\ntemperature exposures, vacuum, and vibration tests.\n\n88\n\nPage Number\n\n1.0 Introduction;\n1.1 Purpose and Scope\n\n1\n\n1.0 Introduction;\n1.3 Battery Design Evaluation\nand Approval\n\n2\n\n4.0 General Battery\nRequirements;
