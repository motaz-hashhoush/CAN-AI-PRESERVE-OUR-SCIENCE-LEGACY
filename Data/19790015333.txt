Bickler deserves first mention in these acknowledgements. Without his continued encouragement, especially during the formulative stage of development, and his\ninsistence that we avoid rules of thumb whenever possible, the SAMICS methodology\nwould not be as widely applicable nor as thoroughly validated as it now is.\nSeveral people, specifically Bruce L. Kleine, James W. Doane, and David C. Crocker,\ncontributed very important ideas in the earliest stages of development. The Leontief formulation for calculation of indirect requirements resulted from discussions with Bruce\nKleine. The financial model of the firm is based, to some extent, on the model Jim Doane\ndeveloped for evaluating the cost of energy from utility-owned solar electric systems\n(Reference 1). The process model and the one-time cost model followed suggestions and\ncritiques provided by Dave Crocker.\nNumerous technical discussions with Robert W. Aster resulted in clarification and improvement of many of the detailed computational algorithms, especially those connected\nwith convergence of the indirect requirement calculation. He also developed the Interim\nPrice Estimation Guidelines (Reference 2), which was based on the SAMICS\nmethodology, and consists of a simplification suitable for manual calculation (see also\nReference 3). His constructive criticism in the later stages of development contributed\ngreatly to the validity and usefulness of SAMICS.\nTechnical suggestions by Chester S. Borden, Guy M. Lohman, and Paul J. Firnett have\nalso contributed to the final product.\nTheodore Barry and Associates, a management consulting firm, was engaged to critique the methodology and to develop the cost account catalog, the indirect requirements\nmatrix functions, and the capital cost estimating relationships (References 4, 5, and 6).\nThe contributions of the following individuals are especially appreciated: Robert J.\nBullemer, James B. Ayers, John Day, David Donovan, and Lawrence Rubenacker. (At\nthe time of this writing, Theodore Barry and Associates is comparing the results of applying the SAMICS methodology, as implemented in the SAMIS III computer program,\nto conceptual point designs of three manufacturing plants prepared by conventional\nmethods.)\nThe SAMICS methodology has been implemented by a computer program, SAMIS III.\nI would like to express my appreciation to Donald A.

It is contended that the model is sufficiently general to be used in any production-line manufacturing environment.\nImplementation of this methcdology by the Solar Array Manufacturing Industry\nSimulation computer program (SAMIS III, Release 1) is discussed.\n\nv\n\nIntroduction\nWhat must the market price for photovoltaic solar modules be to cover the costs of\nmanufacturing and make a reasonable profit? The Solar Array Manufacturing Industry\nCosting Standards (SAMICS) provide a standardized procedure and data base to answer\nthat question.\nThe SAMICS methodology is quite general \xe2\x80\x94 application to production-line manufacturing outside the solar array industry is expected to require only relatively minor augmentation of the data base.\nThis executive summary" contains a discussion of capabilities and limitations, a nontechnical overview of the methodology, and a description of the input data which must be\ncollected. It also describes the activities that have been and are being taken to ensure\nvalidity of the results and contains an up-to-date bibliography of related documents.\n\nBackground\nThe Solar Array Manufacturing Industry Costing Standards were developed to provide\na fair, consistent, reliable way of comparing manufacturing processes being developed by\ndozens of Low-Cost Solar Array (LSA) Project subcontractors. In addition to providing\nguidance on the setting of research priorities, SAMICS was intended to help assess the\nprogress of the LSA project toward its hundred-fold cost reduction goal and to determine\nthe price implications of some of the possible governmental actions that might be taken.\nEven within the confines of an ongoing, well-established, full-scale industry, estimation\nof the costs of manufacturing is a difficult undertaking. The solar array industry is even\nmore challenging, since it is expected to increase in capacity by several orders of magnitude over the next few decades. There is no a priori reason to expect current overhead or\nmarkup ratios to be applicable to the solar array industry of the future. In particular, the\nwide range of manufacturing process alternatives being investigated by LSA subcontractors implies different overhead structures for different process sequences.\nThe approach taken by SAMICS is conceptually very simple and fundamental: describe\nthe direct requirements of each manufacturing process; determine the personnel,\nfacilities, utilities, materials, supplies, and number of machines needed to produce a\nspecified annual amount of the final product; then infer the facilities, indirect personnel,\nand so forth that are needed to support the totality of the direct requirements. To obtain a\nrealistic result, many of the complications of the real world are carefully modeled. Those\ncomplications, however, are internal to the model: a user need only describe the\nmanufacturing process sequence and apply SAMICS (which is available both as a manual\nprocedure and as a computer program) to produce an estimate of the market price that\nmust be received to obtain a specified profit. Detailed manufacturing cost breakdowns are\ndeveloped along the way. This procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\n*This summary is based on a Paper (Reference 9) presented at the Thirteenth IEEE Photovoltaics\nSpecialists\' Conference, held in Washington, D.C., June 5-8, 1978.\n\nit\n\nID LABORATORY RESEARCH\nAND DEVELOPMENT\n\nMANUFACTURING\nPROCESS DESIGN\nio.rus\n\nO3 PREPARE\n\nTECHNOLOGICAL\nINPUT DATA\n\nf P .;\nf\n\nbO- PRICES\t\n\nQUANTITIES\n- EXPENSE\nDETAILS\n- PROCESS COSTS\n- PROFIT\n- MARKUPS\n\n,\n\nf\n\nG\nAPPLY\nSAMICS\nOSTANDARD\nDATA BASE\n\nFigure 1.

(4) Assume an industry size\nand (5) apply the SAMICS methodology. Internal to the methodology, use\n(5a) the standardizing assumptions and data base to infer facilities, indirect\npersonnel, depreciation, corporate income tax, and all other components of\noverhead, including profit. The results are (6) prices, quantities, and detailed\nbreakdowns.\n\nCapabilities and Limitations\nThe SAMICS methodology is very general, and is expected to be usable in virtually any\nmanufacturing industry (see Figure 2). SAMICS can be used to estimate the manufacturing costs and product prices associated with process alternatives in the context of complete manufacturing sequences. It can also be used to assess the impact of changes in financial parameters, such as costs of input goods or services, inflation rates, tax policies,\ninterest rates, and required return on equity. Economies of scale can also be investigated,\nas all costs and indirect requirements are described as functions of annual quantities.\nSAMICS is limited, however, by a number of underlying assumptions. Perhaps the most\nimportant of these limitations is the fact that the market interaction of supply and demand\nis ignored: demand is assumed to be known, steady over time, and unaffected by the\nresultant SAMICS price estimate. That is, the SAMICS price is what the hypothetical industry would have to be able to charge if it were to recover all of the costs of manufacturing and make the specified profit. There is no guarantee that this price would ever actually occur in the market.\n2\n\nINPUT\nDIRECT REQUIRENIENTS\nOF PROCESSES IN A\nPROCESS SEQUENCE\n(PRODUCTION LINE)\n\n\xc2\xa9 O\n\nOUTPUT\nPRODUCT PRICES,\nEXPENSES AND\nOVERHEAD\nBY PROCESS\n\nPA\t\n\nMA\n\nFigure 2. SAMICS Capabilities. SAMICS provides estimates of product prices and\nprocess-by-process expenses for a specified sequence of well-defined manufacturing process steps in a standardized estimating environment. SAMICS is not\nrestricted in applicability to the manufacturing of solar arrays, but does assume\ndedicated production lines. In addition to allowingcomparison of competing process steps and determination of economies of scale, SAMICS can assess the effects\nof changes in\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Economic conditions (interest rates, inflation rates, prices),\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Government policies (tax credits, depreciation formulas, industry structure),\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Company management (fiscal structure, required rate of return on equity).\n\nA second major limitation is that all factories in the industry are assumed to operate in\na production-line mode. SAMICS does not include cost elements to account for set-up\ncosts or for sequencing bottleneck costs, such as must be considered in job shops and flow\nshops. Nor does SAMICS consider the use of specific work stations for the production of\na variety of products. (SAMICS companies, however, can produce a range of products.)\nThe SAMICS data base contains an assumption that every factory operates around the\nclock for 345 days per year. The changes required to permit user specification of the number of shifts, the number of operating days per year, and so on, are minor and are currently being implemented.\nThe SAMICS factories are sized by the input annual production quantity, the fractions\nof capacity at which the plants operate, and the detailed process descriptions. The costs of\nallowing room for expansion can thus be identified. SAMICS can compare the costs of\nfactories of different sizes and the same production level or of the same size and different\nproduction levels, but these cost differences are not the incremental costs of growth:\nSAMICS assumes that each factory was built from scratch. The fact that the SAMICS factories do not grow does not preclude the industry from growing; additional factories with\nthe same or different technology can enter the industry. (These new factories may change\n\n\t\n\nthe market price, but they cannot change the prices the modeled factories have to be able\nto charge to cover costs and make the specified profit.)\n\nThe operating costs ( and revenues) of real companies vary widely from year to year,\nespecially in the first few years of operation. In order to calculate a unique annual cost\nrate. SAMICS assumes that the modeled factories have reached a steady - state operating\ncondition, but that they are still paying off the expenses of getting started. The eventual\nfactory shut - down is assumed to be so far in the future that its effects on costs are negligible. The resultant smoothing of annual costs does take into account escalation rates and\neach company\'s discount rate.\n\nLearning curve phenomena can be easily investigated, but only by - xplicitly assuming\nwhich parameters of which process descriptions change, and by how much.\n\nINDUSTRY FINAL PRODUCT: MODULES\nMAKERS LIST:\nMANUFACTURER\n\nMARKET SHARE\n\nMODULE CO.\nARRAY CO.\n\nRO%\nd0%\n\nPRODUCT: MODULES\t\nPURCHASED\nPRODUCT: POLY\t\n\nMODULE CO\t\n\n\'y\nh \'^\'\xe2\x80\xa2\tPRODUCT:\ni- x\t\n.`v-,.\xe2\x80\xa2,\n\nPOLY CO. -100%\t\t\n\nPRODUCT: MODULES\nPURCHASED\nPRODUCT: CELLS\nSUPPLIER(S):\nCELL CO. - IDD%\n\nCELLS\nCELL CO\nPURCHASED\no\t\nPRODUCT: WAFERS\nSUPPLIER(S):\n^^\nWAFER CO. - 100%\nto\n\nARRAY\n\t\n\nf\t\n\nPOLY CO\t\nC==\t\n\n\t\n\'^ f\nf 4 Yr9 j-:\n\n+;\xe2\x80\xa2^\'\t\n;,\t\n\n^\xe2\x80\xa2,;..,\t\n\'\t\n\nWAFER CO\t\n\nt\t\n\nPRODUCT: WAFERS\nPURCHASED\nPRODUCT: POLY\nSUPPLIER(S):\nPOLY CO. - 100%\n\nPRODUCT: POLY\nPURCHASED\nPRODUCT: NONE\n\nFigure 3. A Possible Structure of the SAMICS Industry. The companies that make the industry \'s final product, and their shares of the market are specified on a "Makers\n-List.\' Each product required by a company has a "Suppliers List." ( In SAMICS\nterminology, a "product" is something made within the modeled industry. Products not made within the industry are called " commodities," and their prices are\ninput, rather than calculated.) In this illustration, SAMCO is more vertically integrated than MODCO, although they both make modules. SAMCO\'s input product is closer to the raw materials end of the industry.\n\n4\n\nOverview of the SAMICS Methodology\nIn concept, the SAMICS methodology is quite simple. Complications come in only in\nthe detailed submodels that are internal to the model (such as in the calculation of corporate income taxes).\nThe structure of the industry is defined by specifying who (which of the hypothetical\ncompanies) buys what from whom, as illustrated in Figure 3. Each hypothetical company\nis defined by listing the manufacturing processes it contains and by specifying. values for a\nvariety of financial parameters. Except for the process lists, these inputs are standardized.\nThe company description is illustrated in Figure 4.\nEach manufacturing process (see Figure 5) is defined in terms of a few performance and\ncost parameters and a detailed list of its direct requirements. (Direct requirements are\nthose things required by the process to produce its product, such as factory floor space,\nassembly line workers, e.ectricity, cooling water, sulfuric acid, and silicon wafers.)\n\nCOMPANY\nIDENTIFIER\n\nFigure 4. The SAMICS Company Description. Non-standardized input consists of company identifiers (a short referent and a Ionger descriptive name), a list of products\nproduced, a list of processes used, and a tut of purchased Products. Each\npurchased product has a list of suppliers. Not shown in this figure is the collection\nof standardized financial parameters.\n5\n\nDIRECT REQUIREMENTS\nPER\t\n\n^v\n\nMINUTE\n\nINPUT PRODUCT($) REQUIRED\nAND YIELD(S)\n\nr: dr-O\nOfF\n\n-\n\n^\n\n=\n\n0000011\n1EM\n\nPRODUT\nPRODUCT\n\n\xc2\xae\xc2\xae\t\n\nDESCRIPTION\nON\n\nACME WAFERER\n\nEQUIPMENT\t\nCOST FACTORS\t\n\nPROCESS REFERENT,\t\nDESCRIPTION AND\t\nCHARACTERISTICS\t\n\nDIRECT REQUIREMENTS \t\nPER MACHINE PER SHIFT \t\n\nDIRECT ^\nREQUIREMENTS\nPER MACHINE\n\nFigure S. The SAMICS Manufacturing Process Description. The core of the input to the\nSAMICS methodology is the description of manufacturing processes. The number\nof machines is determined from the annual output quantity and the process characteristics ( output rate and machine duty cycle). The process sequence is determined\nfrom the input/output product specifications. Direct requirements are determined\n\nfrom the direct requirements of the process, the number of machines, and standardized operating times. Indirect requirements ( foremen, air conditioning, parking\nlot, etc.) are determined by the SAMICS methodology to be those needed to support ( after aggregation to the company \'s scale of operation) the direct requirements.\n\nAn extensive body of standardized data is a part of SAMICS. This standard data includes indirect requirements relationships (such as how much building space is needed\nfor each square meter of factory floor space), price information for all direct and indirect\nrequirements, capital cost estimating relationships for each of the facilities parameters,\nand economic parameters (such as the general rate of inflation and the corporate income\ntax rate schedule). The casual user of SAMICS need not concern himself with any of this\n;\nstands A Jata.\nOnce the descriptive data is ready, the user specifies the annual production quantity of\nthe industry, and the SAMICS methodology is applied ( either by hand or by using the\nSAMIS III computer program (References 7, 10, 11)) as illustrated by Figures 6, 7, and B.\nFirst, all product and direct requirement quantities are calculated from the annual\nquantity of the industry by using the industry structure and the process descriptions.\nWithin each company, direct requirements are collected and used to infer the indirect requirements.\nThen, starting at the raw materialf end of the industry, so that product prices are always known when needed, all of the annual expenses of each hypothetical company are\ncalculated in turn, using standardized prices. Overhead expenses are calculated explicitly\n6\n\n\t\n\nINDUSTRY SIZE OF 100 x 10 6 W0NEAR\nHARDWARE PERFORMANCE OF 100 W Fit /MODULE\nFINAL PRODUCT OLPANTITY (10 6 MODULE YEAR)\nPRODUCT: 100,000 MODULES YEAR\n\nMANUFACTURER\nMODULE CO.\nARRAY CO.\n\nPURCHASED PRODUCT:\n\nQUANTITY\n\n8.8 x 10 7 CELLS YEAR\n\n400,000 MODULES YEAR\n600,000 MODL\'f ES\'YEAR\n\nSUPPLIER(S): CELL CO. - 10016\n\nPRODUCT: 8.8 x 10^ CELLS YEAR\n\nPRODUCT: 600,000 MODULES \'YEAR\nPURCHASED PRODUCT:\n4.7 x 10 6 KG YVA\n(OF SOLAR GRACE POLY)\nSUPPLIER($): POLY CO. - 100\xc2\xb0=\n\nARRAY CC\n\nPURCHASED PRODUCT:\n9.6 x 10 7 WAFERS YEAR\nSUPPLIER($): WAFER CO. - 100\xc2\xb0c\n\nJI..\'i\n\n\t\n\nPRODUCT: 9.6x 10 7 \'WAFER$ YEAR\nPURCHASED PRODUCT:\nWAFER CO\t\n_\t\n\n3.2 x 106 KG YEAR\n(OF SOLAR GRADE POLY)\nSUPPLIER($): POLY CO. \xe2\x80\x94 100\n\nPOLY CO\t\n\nPRODUCT: 7.9 x 10 6 KG YEAR\n(OF SOLAR GRADE POLY)\n\nFigure 6. The SAMICS Methodology Quantities Calculation. The assumed annual industry demand generates "orders" for each company\'s output product(s). The\npurchased product quantities are determined by generating similar "orders" for\neach process step in each company\'s process sequence, using manufacturing process yields. After all quantities have b.-en calculated, prices of all intra-industry\nproducts are calculated, starting at the raw materials end of the industry, as illustrated by Figure 7.\n\nfrom the indirect requirements. Remaining company expenses (such as replacement of\nfacilities, income taxes, profit, and partial recovery of start-up expenses) are calculated\nfrom a financial model of the firm. To facilitate detailed study, all expenses are allocated\nback to the processes. Finally, product prices are calculated by equating annual revenues\nto annual expenses. Eventually, the price of the final product of the industry is obtained.\n\nInput Data Requirements\nFor use in the solar array industry, SAMICS specifies all of the input data required except the company process lists and the detailed process descriptions. It should be noted,\nhowever, that SAMICS is still evolving, as is the technology with which it is intended to\ndeal. Hence, frequent minor additions to the standard data base are to be expected.\n\n7\n\nr^\n\nCOMPANY PRODUCT:\n9.6x 10 7 WAFERSPYEAR\n\nPRICE Of\nWAFERS\n\nDETERMINE PRICE THAT\n(EQUATE, REVENUE TO EXPENSES\n\nSTANDARD\nASSUMPTIONS\n\nIDS %W\nPROCESS\n\nCA PITAL EXPENSES\n\nx 105\n\nOVERHEAD EXPENSES\n\n4.72 x 10,\nCROPGRIND\nPROCESS\n\nINFER\nANNUAL\nCOMPANY INDIRECT\nSUPPORT\nDIRECT\nNEEDS\nREWTS\n\nANNUAL\nCOMPANY\nINDIRECT\nNEEDS\n\nn\nFINAN-\n\n2,5 x 105\nINGOTS/YEAR\nGROWINGOT\nPROCESS\n\nT\t\nPRODUCED PRODUCT\t\n3.2 x 10 6 KG `PEAR\n\nl\nSTANDARD\nPRICES\n\\\n\nDIRECT EXPENSES\nINDIRECT EXPENSES\n\nC PITAL REQUIREMENTS\nr---80 PROCURED PRODUCT EXI*NSES\n\nPRICE OF POLY (SOLAR GRADE POLYSILICON)\nFROM MODEL OF POLYCO\n\nFigure ".

Standard assumptions are used to infer company\n\nindirect requirements. Financial models provide estimates of overhead expenses,\nthen the company\'s product price is chosen st y that annual revenues equal annual\nexpenses. (Profit is considered to be one of the expenses that must he covered by\nrevenue). This price is then passed along to the company that purchases this company\'s product.\n\nProcess\n\nDescription-\n\nIt will generally be the case that the most difficult, time-consuming activity in the application of SAMICS will be the development of ar, initial set of process descriptions. A\ndetailed understanding of the direct requirements of each of the processes in the hypothetical companies is essential for the preparation of any detailed cost estimate.\n\nApplication Beyond the Solar Array Industry\nIn order to apply the SAMICS methodology to other industries, it is necessary to\nreplace the standard industry structure data with data which is appropriate. It is also\nnecessary to develop the relevant process descriptions. These are straightforward procedures.\nA more difficult requirement is the need to augment the standardized data base. Price\ninformation must be obtained for any new kinds cif direct or indirect requirements.\nCapital cost estimating relationships are needed for any new kinds of facilities\nparameters. And, indirect requirements relationships must be developed for every new\nkind of direct and indirect requirement. None of these is particularly difficult to do, but\nthe character of the analyses required is different from that of the other data preparation\ntasks.\n\nr\nBASIC CONCE"TS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 TOTAL = DIRECT + INDIRECT\nFUNCTION ii(TOTAL\n\xe2\x80\xa2 INDIRECT =\n\nI\n\n0y\nmv0\niW ^\n0\nZ\n\ni)\n\nTOTAL REQM\'T FOR X\n\n"FAST" ALGORITHM\nD\nITERATION LOOP\nN-n-f(T)\nT-o- D + N\n\nT-w-y;%+\t\n\nFigure 8. The SAMICS Methodology Indirect Requirements Inference. Direct requirements, such as the laborers and floor space shown at the left, must he supported in\norder to run a company. The laborers require supervisors and plant lighting (to\nmention just two of their needs). The supervisors, in turn, require secretarial support and office equipment; the lighting requires electricity; and so on. Floor space\nrequires walls and ceilings. The facilities require guards and fences. These indirect\nrequirement relationships are defined numerically by standardized functions, as\nsuggested in the upper right of this figure. A fast algorithm for calculating the indirect requirements resulting from the direct requ i rements has been developed,\nand is hinted at in the box at the lower right.\n\nValidation Activities\nEnsuring that the SAMICS methodology produces believable price estimates and cost\nbreakdowns has been a major consideration throughout its three years of development\n(Figure 9).\nThere are three major components to the validation plan. The first is an ongoing\nsolicitatio ^ of criticism, both constructive and otherwise. The methodology has been presented in retail within the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at Low - Cost Solar Array Project\nIntegration Meetings, at DOE Photovoltaics Program semiannual reviews, at IEEE\nPhotovoltaics Specialists Conferences, and at a joint meeting of the Operations Research\nSociety of America (ORSA) and the Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS). Individual\nLSA project contractors have been asked to comment on the methodology. A management consulting firm was even hired to prepare a detailed critique ( Reference 4).\nThe second major part of the validation plan is the comparison of SAMICS results with\nthe results of a detailed conceptual plant design produced by conventional methods. This\ncomparison is underway \xe2\x80\x94 conceptual plant designs for a specified process sequence at\nthree scales of operation were obtained from a contract in the summer of 1977 ( Reference\n\n9\n\nj* r\n\nPRICE vs\t\nQUANTITY\t\n\nINDIRECT\nREQMTS\n\nMETHODOLOGY\nECONOMIC\nPARAMETERS\n\nEXPERIENCE\nJUDGEMENT\nCOA40ON SENSE\n\nCOMPUTER\nPROGRAM\n\nPROCESS\nDESCRIPTIONS\n^..YY J\n\nFigure 9. Validation of SAMICS. Intensive and extensive attention has been given to\nassuring the validity of SAMICS in all four of the following areas: Standardized\ndata (economic parameters, indirect requirements relationships, and price versus\nquantity functions); standardized methodology, including the SAMIS III computer program; nonstandardized data \xe2\x80\x94 the process descriptions; and, most important of all, the reasonableness of results.\n5, Volume III): the SAMICS methodology is being applied to the same sequence at the\nsame scales of operation during the latter part of 1978.\nThe third major part of the validation plan is the continual application of common\nsense and experienced judgment by users of the methodology. This is expected to be\nespecially valuable in finding and correcting flaws in the standardized price data.\nIn addition to the major steps described above, the validation plan includes close attention to many more minor details. For example, despite the novelty of many of the\nSAMICS submodels and algorithms, much of the extensive cost estimation literature has\nbeen reviewed, assessed, and incorporated. The approach chosen minimizes the use of\njudgmental factors and "undetermined coefficients" in order to maximize the testability\nof the methodology. Modern programming methods \xe2\x80\x94 such as use of a design language,\nstructured design, and "egoless programming" \xe2\x80\x94 were employed to ensure correctness of\nthe computer program. The complete methodology was simplified to produce a manual\nprocedure, which was then applied to a complete process ,equence. The resulting price\nestimates and cost breakdowns were then assessed iot validity. These manual results have\nbeen compared in detail with the computer results for the same process sequence.\n\n10\n\nMuch, but not all, of the validation plan has be g n completed. Release of the\ni\nmethodology and the computer program before validation is complete does entail some\nrisk. This risk is unavoidable, however, because part of the validation process requires\napplication by as wide a variety of users as possible. Deferring application until no risk\nremains would result in unacceptable delays in implementation.\n\nObtaining a SAMICS Capability\nFull instructions for applying the manual SAMICS procedures are contained in\nReferences 2, 3, 5 (Volume I), 12, and 13.\nThe computerized version of the SAMICS methodology can be obtained in either of\ntwo forms. Virtually immediate access can be achieved by establishing an account with\nNCSS, Inc. (a nationwide time-sharing service \xe2\x80\x94 call (213) 277-7511 collect, ask for Ms.\nSusanna Chen, and mention the SAMIS III computer program) then obtaining detailed\ninstructions for SAMIS III operation from Mr. Paul J. Firnett of JPL (call (213)\n354-4670). Mr. Firnett will also send you a copy of the SAMIS User\'s Guide (Reference\n10).\nThe SAMIS III computer program is intended to be portable to any machine with a\nSimscript I1.5 compiler. A tape copy of the source code can also be obtained from Mr.\nFirnett. Those who wish to establish the program on their own computer system will also\nwant to obtain copies of References 7 and 11.\n\nEventually, the SAMIS III will be available from COSMIC (the Comp".ter Software\nManagement and Information Center, Suite 112, Barrow Hall, University of Georgia,\nAthens, Georgia 30602, (404) 542-3265), which was established to disseminate computer\nsoftware developed by governmental agencies to other governmental agencies, to industry, and to educational and research institutions.\n\nSAMICS Documentation\nThe SAMICS methodology is fully described by the documentation listed in this section. Copies may be obtained from the\nLSA Data Center\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, CA 91103\n(213) 354-4321\nSince SAMICS is still under development, there is an active mailing list for those interested in updates. To be added to that distribution list, please write Mr. Robert G.\nChamberlain at the same address.\n\n!sy\n\nReferences\n1.
