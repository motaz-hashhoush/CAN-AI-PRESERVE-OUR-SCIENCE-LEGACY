This process involves consulting several assets available at the Kennedy Space Center. The process involves several steps. The first step is to determine the requirements for the competition. Once these requirements are determined, the dimensions of the playing field are drawn up, first by hand, and then using computer models. After these drawings are tentatively decided upon, the cost of materials must be determined, so as to fit within the allotted budget for the project. The materials are to then be ordered, assembled, broken down, and stored throughout the duration of the competition. We must also design the advertisements and logos for the competition. This is to market and publicize the competition to college level teams. We must also determine the rules for the competition so as to have uniform requirements for all teams. Once these processes are completed, the competition can be finalized and publicized for the public. The contributing parties are Greg Galloway, Robert Mueller, Susan Sawyer, Gloria Murphy, Julia Nething, and Cassandra Liles.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130011651, "id": "e50e21818c5e4f0a9d249704d4816d24", "publicationDate": "2009-07-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130011651.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130011651/downloads/20130011651.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130011651/downloads/20130011651.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130011651/downloads/20130011651.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
