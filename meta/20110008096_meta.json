While the emphasis is on electronic parts, the vision is broad enough to include materials and software. The effort includes coordination with other agencies, to identify and with the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP). An interim GIDEP Policy for suspected counterfeits was instituted. NASA's recommendation to the policy was for identification of the supplier and suggests allowing access to that information by government only. The issues with the General MIL specification, the testing requirements for radiation issues, the continuing development of Class Y standards for electronic equipment, status of package case isolation tests needed for 750 and 883,enhancement of 750 Internal Visual Inspection are reviewed. Further issues with consistent ESD control conditions across commodities, test methods, humidity limits, etc are briefly reviewed. The cost benefit analysis of film versus Real time radiography are also reviewed.", "title": "NASA Presentation to TechAmerica G12 Committee", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-25T09:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20110008096, "meta": {"author": {"name": "LaBel, Kenneth A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "a3b57f0fd0214bbfbb219d107890c5a9"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20110008096, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sampson, Michael J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "86dafa84385e4038952c68e5ec0351e7"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Presentation", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20110008096, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110008096, "id": "36976f5fec3b45c8949d5f9e2e605cb0", "publicationDate": "2011-02-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110008096.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110008096/downloads/20110008096.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110008096/downloads/20110008096.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110008096/downloads/20110008096.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
