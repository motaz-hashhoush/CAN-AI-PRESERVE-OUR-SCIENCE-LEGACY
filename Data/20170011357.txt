Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL, USA\n\nAbstract The seasonal and diurnal cycles of ocean vector winds in the domain of the South China Sea are\ncharacterized and compared using RapidScat and the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) data sets.\nBroad agreement in seasonal \xef\xac\x82ow patterns exists between these data sets during the year 2015. Both observe\nthe dramatic reversal from wintertime trade winds (November\xe2\x80\x93April) to westerly \xef\xac\x82ow associated with the\nsummer monsoon (May\xe2\x80\x93October). These seasonal changes have strong but not equivalent effects on mean\nwind divergence patterns in both data sets. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally near the Philippines, the data sets agree on several\naspects of the seasonal mean and diurnal cycle of near-surface vector winds and divergence. In particular,\nRapidScat and CCMP agree that daytime onshore and nocturnal offshore \xef\xac\x82ow patterns affect the diurnal\ncycle of winds up to ~200 km west of Luzon, Philippines. Observed disagreements over the diurnal cycle are\nexplainable by measurement uncertainty, as well as shortcomings in both data sets.\n\nPlain Language Summary It is important to know how satellite-based wind data sets compare\nwith one another, in order to understand basic wind patterns in the South China Sea\xe2\x80\x94an area that is\nstrategically important to many countries. The seasonal and daily variability of low-altitude winds over the\nSouth China Sea was studied using two independent satellite data sets that report both wind speed and\ndirection. One of these data sets spans a few decades, while the other is much shorter but more precisely\nmeasures the daily cycle of winds. The two data sets agree well on seasonal wind shifts during the year 2015.\nBoth observe the dramatic reversal from winter trade winds (November\xe2\x80\x93April) to the summer monsoon\n(May\xe2\x80\x93October). Both data sets also agree on wind shifts throughout a typical day near the island of Luzon in\nthe northern Philippines. Relative to the average wind pattern, in the morning winds blow onshore, while\novernight they reverse and blow offshore as far as 200 km from the coast. The results give us con\xef\xac\x81dence that\nwe can use both data sets to understand different parts of the wind climatology near the Philippines.\n1. Introduction\nThe South China Sea is a region of great meteorological variability and is strategically signi\xef\xac\x81cant from the\npolitical (e.g., Hayton, 2015), economic (e.g., Zheng et al., 2013, 2012), and military (e.g., United States\nDepartment of Defense, 2015) perspectives. Because of this, there is substantial interest in improving subseasonal to seasonal weather forecasting in this region (Chan et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2015; Fukutomi & Yasunari,\n2002; Lau et al., 2000; Wu & Zhang, 1998; Yang et al., 2015), as well as documenting interannual variability\n(e.g., Fang et al., 2006).\nThis region is broadly affected by the East Asian monsoon, which causes seasonal reversals of winds in and\naround the South China Sea (Chen & Chen, 1995; Ciesielski & Johnson, 2006; Hasager et al., 2016; Wang\net al., 2004). Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, easterly trade winds during the boreal winter months are replaced by monsoon\nwesterlies during boreal summer. Beyond this seasonal variability, winds and precipitation in this region\nare impacted intraseasonally by the eastward propagating 40\xe2\x80\x9350 day Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO)\n(Zhang, 2005). During the boreal summer, a form of the MJO\xe2\x80\x94called the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal\nOscillation (BSISO)\xe2\x80\x94can occur, and it is distinguished by both northward and eastward propagation of\n\xef\xac\x82uctuations in (among other atmospheric state parameters) winds and precipitation (Fu & Wang, 2004; Lee\net al., 2013).\n\nPublished 2017. This article is a US\nGovernment work and is in the public\ndomain in the United States of America.\n\nLANG\n\nThe MJO and BSISO have complex interactions with the South China Sea and Maritime Continent region,\nwhich includes the islands encompassing the countries of the Philippines, Indonesia, and others. Indeed, the\nMaritime Continent often interacts signi\xef\xac\x81cantly with the propagation of the MJO signal (Birch et al., 2016;\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9668\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\n10.1002/2017JD027516\n\nVitart and Molteni, 2010). This effect may be linked to the strong diurnal cycles of winds and precipitation\nobserved in this region (Huang et al., 2010; Ichikawa & Yasunari, 2006; Li et al., 2010; Love et al., 2011;\nPloshay & Lau, 2010). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that further improvements to subseasonal and\nseasonal forecasting in and around the South China Sea region will require improved understanding of the\ncomplex interplay between intraseasonal oscillations such as the MJO and BSISO and the island-driven\ndiurnal cycles (Ho et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2016).\nKey to any forecasting improvements is gaining a better understanding of the physical processes controlling\nmeteorological variability in this region. This requires analysis of a large variety of data sets and is the focus of\nan upcoming \xef\xac\x81eld campaign called Propagation of Intraseasonal Tropical Oscillations (Propagation of\nIntraseasonal Tropical Oscillations, 2017). Propagation of Intraseasonal Tropical Oscillations (PISTON) is\nplanned to be focused on the western coastal region of the island of Luzon in the Philippines. One of the reasons is that this area is strongly impacted by island-driven diurnal cycle effects, making it a natural laboratory\nfor understanding how intraseasonal and diurnal atmospheric and oceanic oscillations interact.\nBefore addressing intraseasonal variability, however, the fundamental seasonal and diurnal variability of\nwinds is this region needs to be better understood. The hypothesis of this study is that these diurnal and\nseasonal changes are very large and thus could mask potentially more subtle intraseasonal changes, if the\nintraseasonal analysis did not properly account for them. Thus, the focus of the present study is on quantifying the seasonal and diurnal cycles of near-surface winds in the vicinity of the Philippines, and a follow-on\nstudy will address the intraseasonal variability.\nOcean vector winds have been provided routinely by satellite for multiple decades (Hilburn et al., 2016;\nSharma & D\xe2\x80\x99Sa, 2008; Zierden et al., 2000); however, most of these satellites have been in Sun-synchronous\norbits and thus pass over the same region at \xef\xac\x81xed times of the day. A model-enhanced data set, called\nCross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) (Atlas et al., 2011; Wentz et al., 2015), has sought to overcome this\nlimitation by assimilating observations from multiple satellites, as well as surface-based observations.\nCCMP covers multiple decades (1987\xe2\x80\x932016 as of this study) and is 6-hourly resolution\xe2\x80\x94the minimum\nneeded to resolve (at least coarsely) a diurnal wind feature.\nThere is interest in determining whether CCMP can quantitatively characterize key aspects of the diurnal\nwinds near the Philippines, particularly given the inherent uncertainties associated with the realism of this\nmodel-enhanced data set (McGregor et al., 2017). Recently, a scatterometer instrument called RapidScat\n(Lin et al., 2017; Madsen & Long, 2016; Paget et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017) operated for nearly 2 years on\nthe International Space Station (ISS). Since the ISS is in a non-Sun-synchronous orbit, RapidScat provided\nobservations in the same location throughout the diurnal cycle. This provides an independent data set to\ncompare against CCMP. RapidScat can be used to study the diurnal cycle of winds at higher temporal resolution than CCMP, but improved understanding of its ability to quantify the diurnal cycle is needed. There is\nalso interest in examining the diurnal cycle of near-surface wind divergence, since this parameter is rarely\nexamined in detail in this region. For example, Wood et al. (2009) examined the diurnal cycle of near-surface\nwind divergence but focused on global-scale observations, while Tang et al. (2014) only focused on the global\ndiurnal cycles of zonal and meridional winds without considering divergence. Meanwhile, the modeling work\nof Park et al. (2011) indicated important diurnal variability in divergence near the Philippines.\nThe goals of this study are to (1) determine diurnal cycle of ocean winds near the Philippines (especially west\nof the island of Luzon) at high spatial/temporal resolution (0.25\xc2\xb0 and 2 hourly); (2) examine how well CCMP\ncharacterizes the wind climatology and diurnal cycle relative to RapidScat; and (3) determine near-surface\ndivergence \xef\xac\x81elds near the Philippines along with their diurnal cycles. Achieving these goals will serve as\nan important \xef\xac\x81rst step toward improving our understanding of the seasonal and diurnal variability of winds\nnear the Philippines, thereby setting the stage for future investigation into intraseasonal variability, particularly using the long-term CCMP data set as well as \xef\xac\x81eld observations from PISTON.\n\n2. Data and Methodology\n2.1. RapidScat\nRapidScat was a Ku band scatterometer that operated on the ISS from October 2014 to August 2016\n(RapidScat Project, 2016). This instrument was very similar to the QuikSCAT instrument, as it was built from\n\nLANG\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9669\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\n10.1002/2017JD027516\n\nQuikSCAT spare parts, and therefore the data have been processed very similarly to the QuikSCAT data set\n(Fore et al., 2013). The data set that was used in this study was the v1.0 Level 2B climate-quality ocean wind\nvectors at 12.5 km resolution. This data set is processed using the full antenna footprints without any range\nsubdivisions, and also features calibration corrections for the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) episodes that\nperiodically affected the instrument (RapidScat Project, 2016). According to Havens and Poulson (2016),\nRapidScat had 92.5% uptime, with most outages caused by visiting vehicles to the ISS. In addition, approximately 80% of the data were identi\xef\xac\x81ed as good quality, with reduced-quality observations commonly\ncaused by ISS altitude and attitude variability. RapidScat is able to measure the individual zonal wind (U)\nand meridional wind (V) components with better than 0.7 m s\xc3\x801 precision relative to other scatterometers\n(Wang et al., 2017).\nThe entire period of RapidScat observations (October/2014 to August/2016) was analyzed in this study.\nEach orbit granule was analyzed for possible intersection with the analysis domain of 5\xc2\xb0S to 20\xc2\xb0N and\n110\xe2\x80\x93130\xc2\xb0E (see Figure 1 for a depiction of the analysis domain). For each granule that was, divergence\nwas calculated in swath coordinates using a centered, second-order, \xef\xac\x81nite-difference approach (i.e.,\nDerivatives First, Averages Second or DFAS in the nomenclature of O\xe2\x80\x99Neill et al., 2015), and all valid U, V,\nand divergence observations from each wind vector cell (WVC) inside the domain were saved (along with\ngeolocation and timing information).\nAfterward, these data were assigned to a 0.25\xc2\xb0 resolution grid for the domain using a nearest neighbor\napproach. Data also were assigned to 2 h bins during the diurnal cycle, again using a nearest neighbor\napproach. Finally, subsetting by month and year was done. Analysis gridpoints with fewer than 400\nRapidScat observations during the entire 22 month data set were not considered in this study. This eliminated many coastal gridpoints with measurements of dubious quality due to the presence of land.\nSensitivity studies using different averaging techniques or more aggressive \xef\xac\x81ltering on data quality \xef\xac\x82ags\nwere also performed. Under certain circumstances (e.g., polar-orbiting satellites), the binning-and-averaging\ntechnique described above is known to cause biases in satellite mean \xef\xac\x81elds on monthly and longer time\nscales (Patoux & Levy, 2013). In order to gauge the impact of any possible biases resulting from binning\nand averaging, a sensitivity study was performed where the RapidScat data set was \xef\xac\x81rst interpolated to daily\ngrids using the technique of Zeng and Levy (1995). In order to mitigate biases, this technique uses a custom\ndata weighting that works in both distance and time (their equation (2)), and for this sensitivity study the\ncharacteristic distance and time scales were set to 100 km and 1 day, respectively. The daily grids were then\naccumulated into seasonal means. Note that this interpolation technique precludes examining diurnal\nevolution, and thus was used only for studying differences in seasonal means. A sensitivity study also was\nperformed using standard binning and averaging but excluding all wind vector cells (WVCs) containing\npositive rain \xef\xac\x82ags. These sensitivity study results will be presented in section 3.\n2.2. Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform\nThis study also analyzed the Version 2.0, Level 3.0 CCMP ocean vector wind data set (Wentz et al., 2015). This\ndata set is available for 1987\xe2\x80\x932016 (as of this study) at 0.25\xc2\xb0 spatial resolution and 6 h temporal resolution.\nThis data set is composed of model-assimilated satellite and buoy measurements of ocean winds. The period\nof time analyzed in this study was 3 October 2014 through 30 May 2016, which comprises the entire sampling\noverlap between RapidScat and CCMP (as of the time of this study; CCMP is planned to be extended into the\nfuture). During this time, satellite ocean wind platforms included Advanced Scatterometer on MetOp-A\n(ASCAT-A), WindSat, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI), Advanced\nMicrowave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2), and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMI/S)\non the F17 satellite. Many of these satellites only observe at \xef\xac\x81xed times of the day, although GMI varies\nthroughout the diurnal cycle similar to RapidScat (Hou et al., 2014). However, GMI only observes wind speeds,\nnot vectors. Crucially, CCMP does not include RapidScat; therefore, it constitutes an independent data set,\nwhich simpli\xef\xac\x81es comparative analysis.\nCCMP data also were subsetted to the same spatial domain as RapidScat. However, CCMP already was\nprebinned at 6 h resolution, so no further temporal binning was performed. Divergence was calculated on\nthe spatial grid using a centered, second-order, \xef\xac\x81nite-difference approach with no additional smoothing.\nSubsetting of CCMP data by month also was done.\n\nLANG\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9670\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\n10.1002/2017JD027516\n\nFigure 1.

CCMP Monthly Mean Flow\nIn order to understand the comparisons between CCMP and RapidScat, they must be viewed in context of\nthe typical wind climatology for this region. Figure 1 shows monthly mean winds, derived from analysis of\nall 2015 CCMP data, for the region near the Philippines, including portions of the South China Sea and\nPhilippine Sea. What is observed is easterly to northeasterly trade winds in January (Figure 1a), which then\nbegin to reverse during the premonsoon spring, ultimately leading to strong southwesterly \xef\xac\x82ow during\nthe peak monsoon months of July\xe2\x80\x93August (Figures 1g and 1h) (e.g., Xie et al., 2007). This pattern weakens\nin the fall, and then during November and December (Figures 1k and 1l) the trade winds\nreestablish themselves.\n\nLANG\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9671\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\n10.1002/2017JD027516\n\nDuring wintertime (Figures 1a, 1b, and 1l), the trade wind strength is clearly reduced in the wake of the\nPhilippine archipelago\xe2\x80\x94notably the islands of (from north to south) Luzon, Mindoro, and Mindanao. (For a\npolitical map of the Philippines including island names, see National Geographic Society, 2014.) In addition,\nthere is cyclonic curvature of the winds off the northwest coast of Luzon. This curvature also was observed by\nWang et al. (2008) using QuikSCAT. Between major islands in the archipelago there are indications of\nintensi\xef\xac\x81ed gap \xef\xac\x82ows, such as between Luzon and Mindoro, as well as between Mindoro and Panay\n(Gierach et al., 2012). This basic trade wind pattern\xe2\x80\x94with wake stagnation, cyclonic curvature, and gap\n\xef\xac\x82ows\xe2\x80\x94still dominates in March and April (Figures 1c and 1d), but wind speeds are reduced.\nIn May (Figure 1e), however, there is a dramatic weakening of the winds west of the Philippines. As the southwesterly monsoon \xef\xac\x82ow sets up in summer of the west coast (Figures 1f\xe2\x80\x931h), there even are indications of\nwake stagnation to the northeast of Luzon, especially in July (Figure 1g). However, mean strength of the\nmonsoon \xef\xac\x82ow never reaches the wintertime trade wind strength, so there is much less cyclonic curvature\nand weaker gap \xef\xac\x82ows near the Philippines themselves. There is a very interesting reversing gap \xef\xac\x82ow between\nthe Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and Halmahera, which is strongest in the southerly direction during\nJuly\xe2\x80\x93September (Figures 1g\xe2\x80\x931i) and in the northerly direction during January\xe2\x80\x93March (Figures 1a\xe2\x80\x931c). (For a\npolitical map of Indonesia including island names, see National Geographic Society, 2014.) During October\n(Figure 1j), calm winds return to the central Philippines, while weak trades begin to set up north of Luzon, leading to some cyclonic curvature northwest of the island.\nBased on the climatology in Figure 1, the six months during 2015 with the strongest trade wind signatures\n(northeasterly \xef\xac\x82ow with wake stagnation, cyclonic curvature, and gap \xef\xac\x82ows) west of the Philippines are\nJanuary\xe2\x80\x93April (Figures 1a\xe2\x80\x931d) and then November\xe2\x80\x93December (Figures 1k and 1l). For simplicity, this period\nwill be called November\xe2\x80\x93April. The other six months, May\xe2\x80\x93October (Figures 1e\xe2\x80\x931j), feature primarily calm to\nsouthwesterly \xef\xac\x82ow west of the archipelago, with only the transition month of October featuring any signi\xef\xac\x81cant trade wind activity nearby. Even then, this occurs only in the northern Philippines. Therefore,\nNovember\xe2\x80\x93April and May\xe2\x80\x93October will be examined separately going forward.\n3.2. Seasonal Comparison\xe2\x80\x94CCMP Versus RapidScat\nFirst, CCMP will be compared with RapidScat on a seasonal mean basis (i.e., monsoon or May\xe2\x80\x93October, and\nnonmonsoon or November\xe2\x80\x93April). Since RapidScat started data collection in late 2014, and ended its data\ncollection before its second year completed, the primary focus for seasonal comparisons will be on CCMP\nand RapidScat during 2015 only. Figure 2 shows the mean \xef\xac\x82ow during May\xe2\x80\x93October 2015 with RapidScat\n(Figure 2a) and CCMP (Figure 2b), while the November\xe2\x80\x93April 2015 results for both are shown in Figures 2c\nand 2d, respectively. Grid points with less than 400 total samples during the entire 22 month data set were\nexcluded from the corresponding RapidScat map, masking most data near coastlines (though conspicuously\nnot near the west coast of Luzon).\nFor May\xe2\x80\x93October 2015, the two data sets provide very similar results, with three notable differences: (1)\nCCMP provides more complete spatial coverage; (2) certain regions show notable differences in wind speed\nbetween RapidScat and CCMP; and (3) RapidScat shows cyclonic curvature of winds, ostensibly due to\nblocking effects, within the Gulf of Tomini (Sulawesi), while CCMP does not have this feature. Both data sets\nindicate a small gap \xef\xac\x82ow due to terrain near the city of Gorontalo on north Sulawesi.\nFor November\xe2\x80\x93April 2015, again results are very similar between the two data sets, and again CCMP provides\nmore complete spatial coverage while notable wind speed differences preferentially occur in certain regions.\nDue to mean wind direction, there are no distinct differences within the Gulf of Tomini; however, there is an\nindication of northerly gap \xef\xac\x82ow west of the island of Pulau Taliabu that is seen by RapidScat, which CCMP\ndoes not resolve. Near the Philippines, RapidScat appears to indicate greater wake stagnation downwind\nof Panay and Negros islands, and stronger gap \xef\xac\x82ows between most western islands in the archipelago.\nHowever, on the windward side of the Philippines, CCMP has more information closer to the coastlines,\nand this appears to indicate slowing of the trade winds as they encounter larger islands, such as Luzon\nand Mindanao. RapidScat does not resolve these features, in part because coastal data are limited within\nthe Philippine archipelago.\nFigure 3 integrates the seasonal comparisons over the entire domain. Because CCMP wind vectors are provided as individual wind components (U and V), these components are compared separately.

Although some outliers are indicated in the Figure 3 histograms, as well as\nthe previously described differences in Figure 2, there is overall very good agreement between the two\nindependent data sets for this domain, regardless of season.\nThe Zeng and Levy (1995) interpolation approach also was used to produce RapidScat seasonal means, with\nthe results shown in Figure S1 in the supporting information. Overall, the seasonal patterns are very similar to\nthe bin-and-average approach, with many of the same similarities and differences between RapidScat and\nCCMP. The one big change, however, is that Zeng and Levy (1995) enables estimates in poorly sampled\ncoastal regions, due to the 100 km characteristic distance interpolation. Using the 400-sample threshold\nleads to slightly worse agreement between RapidScat and CCMP in the domain average (Figure S2), but individual component mean offsets and standard deviations remain <0.5 m s\xc3\x801. If the 400-sample threshold is\nremoved, agreement worsens considerably (not shown); though the more sophisticated interpolation\nprovides more aesthetically pleasing results, the \xef\xac\x81lled-in RapidScat data near coastlines still should not\nbe trusted.\n\nLANG\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9673\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\n10.1002/2017JD027516\n\nFigure 3.

(d) November\xe2\x80\x93April 2015, northward component (V).\n\nThe bin-and-average approach, but with rain \xef\xac\x82ags removed, leads to seasonal results that are very similar to\njust keeping the rain-\xef\xac\x82agged data (Figures S3 and S4). However, removing the rain-\xef\xac\x82agged data eliminates\n12.4% of the overall data set, so the 400-sample threshold becomes more stringent and reduces further\nthe data coverage near coastlines/islands.\nOverall, based on the sensitivity studies, it is concluded that all of the above methods are defensible\napproaches to interpolating the RapidScat data set for seasonal comparisons to CCMP, for this domain.\nNone appear to introduce very large biases or variability in excess of 0.5 m s\xc3\x801 in the domain mean, relative\nto CCMP. In addition, the RapidScat methodologies all provide similar results in areas that are notably different than CCMP (e.g., the cyclonic curvature over the Gulf of Tomini). Since the bin-and-average approach\nprovides the most \xef\xac\x82exibility for examining diurnal wind behavior, this interpolation approach will be the\nfocus during the next section.\n3.3. Diurnal Wind Comparison\xe2\x80\x94CCMP Versus RapidScat\nSince CCMP provides 6 h resolution, and RapidScat samples throughout the day, the diurnal cycles of\nwinds in both data sets were compared. For CCMP this was straightforward\xe2\x80\x94simply average the winds\nat each 6 h time step over each 6 month time period, then subtract the average wind at that time step\nfrom the mean seasonal \xef\xac\x82ow. For RapidScat the data were binned with 2 h time steps, and then each\ngrid point was \xef\xac\x81tted via least squares analysis to a diurnal harmonic following Gille et al. (2005, 2016).\nThe analysis was done for the entire temporal overlap between RapidScat and CCMP (roughly October\n2014 through May 2016; Section 2.2). The diurnal harmonic at each time was then subtracted from\nthe mean.\nResults are shown in Figure 4. For ease of comparison, only the RapidScat results at 0, 6, 12, and 18 UTC are\nshown. At 0 UTC RapidScat (Figure 4a) indicates anomalously strong southeasterly offshore \xef\xac\x82ow (relative to\nthe overall mean) northwest of Luzon. Manila (which is on Luzon) is 8 h ahead of UTC, so this is around 8 a.m.\nLocal time. CCMP also indicates similar anomaly winds northwest of Luzon (Figure 4e), but magnitudes\nare reduced.\nMoving to 6 UTC (Figure 4b), or 14 Local in Luzon, anomalous onshore \xef\xac\x82ow is now seen west of Luzon, a\npattern also seen in CCMP at this time (Figure 4f).

Broadly onshore wind patterns are also observed in both data sets northwest\nof Sulawesi and around the northern tip of Borneo, and these \xef\xac\x82ows are stronger in CCMP as well. At 12 UTC\n(20 local; Figures 4c and 4g), both data sets suggest northerly \xef\xac\x82ow anomalies west of Luzon, but RapidScat\xe2\x80\x99s\nanomalies are stronger. Onshore \xef\xac\x82ow also continues near Borneo and Sulawesi, though RapidScat\xe2\x80\x99s pattern is\nmore spatially variable. Finally, at 18 UTC (2 Local; Figures 4d and 4h), RapidScat suggests much stronger easterly offshore \xef\xac\x82ow west of Luzon, though CCMP has the same directionality. Though the temporal analyses are\ndifferent, the results for both data sets are qualitatively similar to the simulated diurnal cycles for this region\nas characterized by Ploshay and Lau (2010) and Wang et al. (2013). Though not shown here, the results for the\nentire RapidScat data set, through August 2016, were very similar to the truncated data set that matched\nCCMP\xe2\x80\x99s temporal coverage. This suggests that future analyses with more complete CCMP coverage of\n2016 would not produce signi\xef\xac\x81cantly different results.\nSince RapidScat lasted less than 2 years, it is important to ensure that the diurnal sampling was relatively uniform in most regions. This would improve con\xef\xac\x81dence in the results presented in Figure 4. Toward that end,\nFigure S5 shows the standard error of RapidScat winds (averaging the results for the separate U and V components) as a function of time of day, with areas of less than 400 samples thresholded. The standard error is\n<0.5 m s\xc3\x801 over much of the domain, throughout the day, with the main exceptions being near coastlines\nand islands. In the domain mean, the standard error is roughly constant throughout the day (~0.3 m s\xc3\x801).\nIn addition, near the west coast of Luzon the coastal sampling artifacts are limited, and standard errors are\nwell behaved throughout the day.\nFigure 5 integrates the diurnal cycle comparisons shown in Figure 4, by presenting histograms of anomaly\nwind differences between RapidScat and CCMP. The domain of interest has been shrunk to focus only near\nthe west coast of Luzon (see Figure 6 for a representation of this domain). The mean offsets support the qualitative inferences from Figure 4. Moreover, all offsets are within \xc2\xb10.4 m s\xc3\x801 for each wind component, and\n\nLANG\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9675\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\n10.1002/2017JD027516\n\nFigure 5.

These differences are only slightly higher\nthan standard errors associated with the RapidScat diurnal sampling shown in Figure S5. Very similar\ndifferences are seen even if the entire domain in Figure 4 is analyzed (not shown). Overall, the results\nsuggest that the diurnal wind differences are within the measurement uncertainties for both RapidScat\nand CCMP (Atlas et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017).\nIn order to better understand the high-resolution variability of winds near the rainfall maximum west of\nLuzon (Park et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2006), the diurnal harmonic of RapidScat winds near Luzon was broken\nout at 2 h resolution (Figure 6). The entire RapidScat data set was used for this analysis. The goodness of \xef\xac\x81t\n(i.e., square of the correlation coef\xef\xac\x81cient, or R2) parameter was also calculated, and the R2 = 0.5 contour is also\nshown in Figure 6.

A clear pattern of alternating onshore\nand offshore \xef\xac\x82ow near Luzon emerges from this \xef\xac\x81gure, where the diurnal harmonic R2 is greater than 0.5.\nOffshore \xef\xac\x82ow is strongest at 22 and 0 UTC (Figures 6a and 6l; morning Local), while onshore \xef\xac\x82ow is\nstrongest at 10 and 12 UTC (Figures 6f and 6g; early evening Local).\n\nLANG\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9677\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\n10.1002/2017JD027516\n\nFigure 7.

(2016). The\ndiurnal winds, both in terms of anomaly magnitude as well as R2 > 0.5, impact the local \xef\xac\x82ow up to ~200 km\nwest of the island, suggesting that the island-driven wind effects have a long reach over the coastal ocean.\nHowever, this is a shorter distance than that of the diurnal impacts modeled by Park et al. (2011).\n3.4. Divergence Comparison\xe2\x80\x94CCMP Versus RapidScat\nFigure 7 shows mean divergence comparisons between CCMP and RapidScat, for May\xe2\x80\x93October 2015\n(Figures 7a and 7b) and November\xe2\x80\x93April 2015 (Figures 7c and 7d). A 5 \xc3\x97 5 boxcar smoothing operator has\nbeen applied to the RapidScat grid in order to clarify overall divergence patterns. Given the differences in\nhow the divergence calculations were made between the two data sets (cf. section 2), the focus of the\ncomparison will be on broad patterns rather than speci\xef\xac\x81c numbers.\nIn May\xe2\x80\x93October (Figure 7b), CCMP indicates light convergence (typically > \xc3\x801 \xc3\x97 10\xc3\x805 s\xc3\x801) over much of the\nSouth China and Philippine Seas. RapidScat (Figure 7a) also suggests overall light convergence in these\nregions, but the pattern is more spatially variable, with isolated regions of light divergence mixed in. The\ntwo data sets disagree about the sign of the divergence off the northern coast of Borneo, with CCMP showing\nnet convergence while RapidScat is more variable. There is some agreement near Sulawesi, especially with\nnet convergence off the northern coast, as well as net divergence extending from east of the Gulf of\nTomini toward the gap between North Sulawesi and Halmahera islands.\n\nLANG\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9678\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\n10.1002/2017JD027516\n\nTable 1\nWhole-Domain Differences in Divergence Between RapidScat and CCMP (i.e., RapidScat Minus CCMP) During 2015\nBin and average\n\nZL1995-swath\n\nZL1995-grid\n\nRain \xef\xac\x82ag removed\n\nMay\xe2\x80\x93Oct\n\xc3\x806 \xc3\x801\n\nMean (10 s )\n\xc3\x806 \xc3\x801\nStandard deviation (10 s )\n\nApr\xe2\x80\x93Nov\n\nMay\xe2\x80\x93Oct\n\nApr\xe2\x80\x93Nov\n\nMay\xe2\x80\x93Oct\n\nApr\xe2\x80\x93Nov\n\nMay\xe2\x80\x93Oct\n\nApr\xe2\x80\x93Nov\n\n1.24\n3.67\n\n1.03\n3.93\n\n0.88\n3.81\n\n0.59\n4.30\n\n0.42\n3.62\n\n0.59\n4.04\n\n1.23\n3.53\n\n0.99\n3.74\n\nNote.

Bin and average and Rain \xef\xac\x82ag removed have had their RapidScat data smoothed by a 5 \xc3\x97 5 boxcar \xef\xac\x81lter on the grid,\nprior to analysis.\n\nDuring November\xe2\x80\x93April 2015 (Figures 7c and 7d), the strong trade winds lead to net divergent \xef\xac\x82ow in both\ndata sets near the northwestern portion of the domain. However, there were notable areas of disagreement\nnear the Philippines. On the windward (eastern) side strong convergence in CCMP was associated with braking of the \xef\xac\x82ow by the terrain. RapidScat could not reproduce this. Divergence patterns on the leeward (westward) side were better matched, although signi\xef\xac\x81cant disagreement in magnitudes remained. For example,\nimmediately west of Luzon RapidScat observed two maxima in convergence. While CCMP also showed convergence in this region, it was much weaker. Alternatively, CCMP has stronger divergence than RapidScat\nnear the Verde Island Passage, between Luzon and Mindoro. Signi\xef\xac\x81cant disagreement between both data\nsets exists in magnitude and sign of divergence near Borneo. Agreement is better near Sulawesi, but not\nas good as May\xe2\x80\x93October.\nThe effects of different approaches to divergence were also explored. Table 1 shows the domain average\ndifferences in divergence during 2015, excluding grid boxes with less than 400 RapidScat samples. As seen\nin Figure 7, over the open ocean there appeared to be a tendency toward more divergent \xef\xac\x82ow in\nRapidScat, and this is con\xef\xac\x81rmed by the domain statistics, with an offset on the order of 10\xc3\x806 s\xc3\x801, depending on season. This offset is reduced if the Zeng and Levy (1995) interpolation approach is applied to the\n\nFigure 8.

The best overall agreement is achieved if the Zeng and Levy (1995) gridded RapidScat winds are used for the divergence calculations (i.e., Averages First, Derivatives Second or AFDS; O\xe2\x80\x99Neill et al., 2015). This is unsurprising, since\neffectively the AFDS method is also what has been applied to CCMP, thereby reducing uncertainty due\nto differences in divergence techniques (the AFDS divergence maps are shown in Figure S6). Finally, only\nmodest improvements with the bin-and-average technique are achieved if rain-\xef\xac\x82agged data are removed.\nThis result is consistent with Milliff et al. (2004) in that\xe2\x80\x94within the tropics at least\xe2\x80\x94accounting for\nrain-\xef\xac\x82agged data may alter speci\xef\xac\x81c values for average vector wind derivatives but does not change\n\nLANG\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9680\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\n10.1002/2017JD027516\n\nfundamental spatial patterns. Nevertheless, regardless of technique, there remains a more divergent\ntendency in the RapidScat data set for this domain.\nThe diurnal cycle of divergence was explored by comparing divergence anomalies relative to the means\nthroughout the day, for the October 2014 through May 2016 period. For RapidScat, again to clarify spatial patterns, diurnal harmonics were \xef\xac\x81t to the 2-hourly binned-and-averaged data set before this differencing\noccurred. Results are shown in Figure 8. CCMP reveals alternatingly anomalously divergent and convergent\n\xe2\x80\x9cwave fronts\xe2\x80\x9d moving off signi\xef\xac\x81cant land masses, such as Borneo and the Philippine archipelago, throughout\nthe day. While RapidScat often matched the sign and even the strength of these divergence anomalies,\nparticularly when examining areas beyond 100 km from coastlines, there are no indications of alternating\n\xe2\x80\x9cwave fronts\xe2\x80\x9d in that data set.\nNear Luzon, there are signi\xef\xac\x81cant differences in both the phasing and strength of the divergence diurnal cycle.\nRapidScat suggests the peak in the divergent anomaly off the west coast of the island occurs near 12 UTC,\nwhile CCMP places this closer at 6 UTC. Meanwhile, RapidScat sees much stronger convergent anomalies at\n18 and 0 UTC. In order to explore this in more detail, the 2-hourly RapidScat results near Luzon are shown in\nFigure 9. Expectedly, the divergence anomalies match the wind harmonic anomalies shown in Figure 6. The\nmorning offshore \xef\xac\x82ow anomaly peak (22 and 0 UTC) is associated with enhanced convergence as the \xef\xac\x82ow\nanomaly slows down far from shore. Meanwhile, the opposite occurs during the onshore peak near 10\xe2\x80\x9312 UTC.\n\n4. Discussion\nThe RapidScat and CCMP data sets agree broadly on the seasonal mean \xef\xac\x82ows in most of this region. For\nexample, both data sets capture the dramatic wind reversals associated with the monsoon, and the implications of these changes for the windward and lee sides of the Philippine archipelago. Notably, both data sets\nidentify west of Luzon as an area of weak mean \xef\xac\x82ow regardless of season.\nThis mean \xef\xac\x82ow hides important diurnal variability, however. Alternating onshore and offshore \xef\xac\x82ow patterns\naffect the winds up to approximately 200 km from the coast. According to RapidScat, the offshore \xef\xac\x82ow is\nstrongest in the morning hours (~0 UTC or 8 Local), and onshore \xef\xac\x82ow is strongest in the early evening\n(~12 UTC or 20 Local). There is clockwise rotation of the wind anomalies between these two peaks. CCMP sees\nonshore \xef\xac\x82ow being relative stronger at 6 UTC (14 Local) and relatively weaker at 12 UTC. The reasons for this\nare not clear, but the mean diurnal differences between RapidScat and CCMP are less than 0.4 m s\xc3\x801 for either\nwind component (Figure 6), so it is not a large difference and may be within measurement uncertainty.\nMoreover, this small discrepancy is not an artifact of the diurnal harmonic, as simple averages of the\nRapidScat data throughout the diurnal cycle also suggest an onshore maximum near 10\xe2\x80\x9312 UTC (not shown).\nThis makes sense since the harmonic explained most of the diurnal wind variance west of Luzon.\nOne hypothesis is that \xef\xac\x82ow channeling within the Lingayen Gulf contributes to this later maximum, because\nthe onshore \xef\xac\x82ow is more parallel to the Gulf opening at 10\xe2\x80\x9312 UTC and wind speed anomalies are maximized\nnear the mouth of the Gulf (Figure 6). RapidScat would be able to observe such a real effect, while the 0.25\xc2\xb0\nresolution for the model producing the CCMP data set may not resolve the landmass gap well enough. Note,\nfor example, how CCMP cannot reproduce the RapidScat-observed cyclonic curvature of May\xe2\x80\x93October winds\nin the narrow Gulf of Tomini near Sulawesi, Indonesia (Figure 2). This would also explain why RapidScat sees\nrelatively stronger offshore \xef\xac\x82ow near 0 UTC, when the winds are again aligned with the Gulf but in the\nopposite direction.\nA higher-resolution scatterometer, which could probe the interior of the Lingayen Gulf and other \xef\xac\x81ne-scale\nwaterways, would assist with further testing of this hypothesis. Reprocessing the RapidScat data to provide\nbetter coverage near coasts may help as well. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has proven to be very useful\nfor studying gap \xef\xac\x82ows near the Philippines at very high resolution (Gierach et al., 2012) and could also assist\nwith such an analysis, although sample size would be a concern.\nThere are timing, sign, and magnitude discrepancies in divergence between RapidScat and CCMP near the\nPhilippines and other coastlines. The disagreements in divergence near coastlines likely arise from three\ncauses. One is the limited sampling by RapidScat near coasts, one is the limited spatial resolution of the\nCCMP model, and one is the nature of the CCMP data set. The \xef\xac\x81rst two have been discussed previously. In\nterms of the third possibility, CCMP winds are reported everywhere but are attenuated toward 0 m s\xc3\x801\n\nLANG\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9681\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\n\n10.1002/2017JD027516\n\nover signi\xef\xac\x81cant landmasses, such as Borneo and Luzon (CCMP is an ocean vector wind data set only; Atlas\net al., 2011). This effectively creates windward braking (and leeward acceleration) effects in signi\xef\xac\x81cant \xef\xac\x82ow\nregimes, such as wintertime trade winds. Therefore, divergence disagreements between CCMP and\nRapidScat within ~100 km of coasts need to be considered in this context, and better agreement between\nthe divergence data sets over the open ocean is both expected and observed in, for example, Figure 7.\nRegardless, RapidScat does observe in the net slightly more divergent \xef\xac\x82ow over the domain\n(0.4\xe2\x80\x931.2 \xc3\x97 10\xc3\x806 s\xc3\x801 positive offset, depending on methodology).\nIt is hypothesized that the alternating \xe2\x80\x9cwave fronts\xe2\x80\x9d in the diurnal divergence anomalies, seen in the CCMP\ndiurnal cycle (Figure 8), are also an artifact of how the CCMP model treats sea breeze effects. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally,\nthe model likely does not treat the in\xef\xac\x82uence of moist convection on near-surface winds accurately, since\nits focus is on assimilation of scatterometer, radiometer, and buoy winds to produce an ocean vector wind\ndata set, rather than modeling convection (Atlas et al., 2011).\nIndeed, the complex interplay between topography, convection, and winds remains poorly understood, and\nis the subject of active research. For example, while daytime onshore \xef\xac\x82ow near Luzon is likely driven by the\nland heating up (particularly aided by enhanced orography; Xie et al., 2006) to become warmer than the\nnearby sea surface temperatures (SSTs)\xe2\x80\x94that is, a sea breeze\xe2\x80\x94the origin of the offshore \xef\xac\x82ow is less certain.\nIt could be due to the land surface becoming cooler than surrounding SSTs during the nighttime (i.e., a true\nland breeze). However, given that this is a moist tropical environment, such nocturnal cooling is often mitigated by atmospheric water vapor, and thus it is unclear that a true land breeze circulation would occur\non a regular basis.\nAnother possibility is related to the proli\xef\xac\x81c diurnal convection that often occurs in concert with these\nobserved circulations (Park et al., 2011). For example, the onshore \xef\xac\x82ow is typically coincident with a rainfall\nmaximum over Luzon (particularly during the monsoon), while the offshore \xef\xac\x82ow is coincident with\nconvection moving away from land (Park et al., 2011). Such convection could trigger a westward moving\ngravity wave, which would carry the convective signal and its associated out\xef\xac\x82ows offshore (Aves &\nJohnson, 2008; Mapes et al., 2003). This signal also could manifest as nocturnal offshore \xef\xac\x82ow. The ambiguity\nbetween land breeze and convectively driven mechanisms to explain the nocturnal offshore \xef\xac\x82ow could be\nresolved by detailed investigation of the diurnal cycles of air temperature, SST, wind, and precipitation both\nin heavily convective meteorological regimes, as well as in suppressed ones.\n\n5. Conclusions\nThe seasonal and diurnal cycles of ocean vector winds in the vicinity of the South China Sea and the\nPhilippines have been characterized and compared using the RapidScat and CCMP data sets. Broad\nagreement exists between these data sets in terms of seasonal \xef\xac\x82ow patterns. However, the diurnal wind\npatterns do not agree in all parts of this region. In many locations within the South China Sea, including west\nof Luzon, there is some disagreement in the magnitude and timing of vector winds and near-surface wind\ndivergence between RapidScat and CCMP, and there also can be disagreement in divergence sign. The\nreasons for this are likely related to measurement uncertainty, as well as shortcomings in both the RapidScat\n(e.g., short data set length, lack of coastal coverage) and CCMP data sets (e.g., coarse temporal resolution,\nsimplistic model characterization of winds near shore). These issues speak toward the urgent need for\nimproved observations of seasonal, subseasonal, and diurnal wind variability within the South China\nSea domain.\nHowever, the analysis showed that RapidScat provided useful data for quantitatively characterizing the diurnal cycle of winds in otherwise poorly sampled regions like the South China Sea. This is because coverage was\nstable throughout the day, driving standard errors for wind components consistently below 0.5 m s\xc3\x801 in most\nareas and times. Moreover, CCMP and RapidScat agreed well on directionality of the wind diurnal cycles, and\nthe magnitudes of the wind component anomalies agreed within \xc2\xb10.4 m s\xc3\x801. This implies that CCMP will be\nof value for examining, for example, intraseasonal variability of the diurnal cycle, particularly in a qualitative\nsense, since it is a much longer data set than RapidScat. Caution should be taken when examining CCMP\ndivergence diurnal cycle, however, particularly near land. Finally, the analysis showed that the diurnal cycle\nnear Luzon impacted winds up to ~200 km from shore and that topographic features may slightly amplify\nthis effect due to \xef\xac\x82ow channeling.\nLANG\n\nPHILIPPINE WINDS FROM RAPIDSCAT/CCMP\n\n9682\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres\nAcknowledgments\nThis research greatly bene\xef\xac\x81tted from\nhelpful discussions with the following\npeople: Steve Rutledge, Weixin Xu,\nSteve Nesbitt, Georgios Priftis, Piyush\nGarg, Stella Choi, Themis Chronis, Greg\nKing, and Mark Bourassa.
