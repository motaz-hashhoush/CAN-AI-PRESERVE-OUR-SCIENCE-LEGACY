Langer\nInstitute for Flight Mechanics, Braunschweig\n\n/3*\n\nIntroduction\nThis subject deals with the data acquisition equipment for\nthe rotor testing stand. The necessary measurement quantities\nwill be discussed, how they are calibrated and processed and\ndisplayed.\nThe possibilities of measurement value acquisition and further\n\n}\n\nprocessing are varied, as is the entire measurement concept. The\nlatter is directed mainly at the object to be measured and the\n\ni\n\ntime or frequency range of the processes.\nThe measurement concept is to be described specifically for\nthe rotor testing stand with its numerous modifications. These\nmodifications were undertaken, on the one hand, because of technical progress (especially in microelectronics), and on the other\nhand, because some features were insufficient or complete failures.\nSpecifically, the rotor balance construction has been the object\nof numerous alterations; moreover, the demands placed on the measurement program have also been changed, so that the measurement\n;i\n\ntechnology for descending air currents, initially given little\nattention, has come more and more into the foreground.\n1. Sensors for Data Acquisition\n\na\n\nThe technology for sensors has undergone considerable further\ndevelopment recentl y because of the great amount of progress in\nthe area of electronics. The miniaturisation of the sensors has\nbecome especially significant.\n\nNumbers in the margin indicate pagination in the foreign text.\n\n.\t\n\nr+^..-.c ..\xe2\x96\xba\xe2\x80\xa2 ^"^e-^r/^ aye \t\n\n_ - -\t\n\n-\t\n\n.__ _ ^._.,\n\n_777\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\ntoo\n\n\t\n\nIfAv\ni\n\nNevertheless, there are still enough problems in the acquisition of measurement values, specifically when measuring rotating\nsystems as in the case of a helicopter rotor. Especially high\nacceleration at the rotor blades makes it very difficult, for\n\nexample, to measure pressure distribution at the blade profile.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\ni\n\nProblems such as the measurement of blade bending shapes in the\nrotating rotor or the determination of instationary descending\nwind field have not yet been satisfactorily solved.\nThe area of measurement technology without t_^ntact for determining the flow rate or for measurement of position is still in\n\nt\n\nthe initial stage in relationship to the demands at the rotor.\nIt may be expected that substantial improvements will be introduced in further years because of the application of lasers\n\nf\n\nj1\n\ncoupled with appropriate optics and electronics.\n1.1 Sensors in an On-Board System\nAll measured value pick-ups and their calibration will he\ndescribed under this heading, not located in the rotating system.\nThese are the probes to be described in the following with the\n\nR .y^y\'\xe2\x80\xa2y^Y\n\nexception of the sensors for descending winds, to be treated\nseparately.\n1.1.1 Measurement of the Angle of the Rotor Mast\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nf\n\nThe measurement of the adjustment angle of the rotor via\n\n^\n\nr\n\nthe angle of the rotor mast may be correct in a strict sense only\nfor the balanced rotor, i.e. if the pitching and rolling moments\n\nF\n\nare equal to zero, because these; moments have an effect on the\nposition of the plane of the blade tips and therefore on the\nangle of rotor adjustment.\nThe resulting error for the jointless 4 blade rotor, however,\t\n\nti\n\nis slight so that the angle of rotor adjustment can be set equal\nto the angle of the mast. This angle is measured via a path pickup, mounted at the fixed portion of the rotor stand (Fig. 1).

This rod is suspended in the path peck-up and\nthe resistance is altered when the rotor is tipped to the front\nor back.\nIn wind tunnel tests, attention must be paid that the cable\n\n/5\n\nwith the metal rod is not exposed to the wind tunnel flow, because\nvibrations and the distortion of the cable lead to erroneous measurement of the angle of rotor adjustment.\nk\n\nThe determination of desired value is undertaken with a potentiometer in the measurement chamber.\t\n\nRegulation is provided\nThis is an\n\nthat the predetermined desired value is maintained. \t\n\nf\n\nadvantageous procedure because the hydraulic cylinder, utilized\nfor the adjustment and maintenance of rotor angle slowly alters\nthe lifting height under strews.\t The indication of the actual\nvalue\t (optional adjustment to the desired value is possible)\nis carried out through a digital voltmeter. \t If the deviation\nthe\t rebetween actual and desired values is greater than 0.1 0 ,\t\ngulation device reacts such that the accuracy is 0.1 \t degree.v\nr\n\n1.1.2\t\n\nRotor Balance\n\n-`,\nk\n\nThe rotor balance has been subjected to numerous modifications\nin the past.\t The reason for this was poor dynamic behavior. \t This\ndoes n"^t mean that the balance was not suitable for measuring\nrotor components, but only that the initially high expectations\nwere not met.\n\nW\n\nThe stress at the rotor head taken as a basis in the design\nof the balance led to the dimensions of the pressure gauge.\nSince the measurements were to be as precise as possible, the\npressure for the expected measurement range was selected and\nmultiplied by 1.5 for security. In order to determine the rotor \t\nbalance statically, six pressure gauges-were employed although\nonly five stress quantities were measured, specifically the \t\n\n,.\nj\n\n3\n\n_.\t\n\n..^,.,\t\n\na .1..\t\n\nayNtLL"witl^a^n1^\'> F:6reY.\t\n\n.1.\n\nlongitudinal force, transverse, force, thrust, pitching moment and\n\t\n\na\n\nrolling moment. The drive torque is determined via a measurement\n\t\nshaft such that only the positional friction between shaft and\n\nt\n\nbalance is measured as moment around the z axis. The version\nillustrated in Fig. 2 shows the initial configuration. Tt was\n\t\ndemonstrated when putting the rotor into operation that the\n\n/6\n\ninitially determined stress quantities did remain in the predicted range statically, but exceeded the measurement range of\nthe pressure gauges dynamically.\nThe next configuration then consisted of four pressure\n\ni\n\ngauges in the z direction with a measurement range of 2000 N\neach, two pressure gauges in the y direction with 5000 N each,\n\nw\n\ni\n\ni^\t\n\nf\n\nand one pressure gauge in the x direction with 1000 N. Furthermore, the plane of measurement was moved up in order to reduce\n\nr\nb\n\nthe lever arm (Fig. 3). The balance is statically overdetermined\nwith the application of seven pressure gauges. The consequences\nof this static overdetermination in calibration and evaluation\nT\n\nwill be discussed later. Initial wind tunnel tests have demon-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 a\n\nstrated that the design of the balance was much too soft so\nthat the high velocity range and extreme rotor ,stress could not\nbe measured. In a wind tunnel test, the swash plate control\ny w\t4\n\nmalfunctioned because of a defect in the electrical system.\nTherefore, it was not possible to control the rotor thereafter\n\nCl\n\n4s^+\n\nwith the result that almost all pressure gauges were destroyed\nthrough overload.\nThis was the reason for further redesigning of the balance:\nthe measurement range of each pressure gauge was expanded to\n5000 N (z and x directions) and 2000 N (y direction). In addition, the pressure gauges now available had a substantially\nsmaller construction height (Fig. 4). The difficulties, however,\nwere still not solved with these measures, because hysteresis\neffects were adced to the limited measurement precision. The\nstatic calibrations resulted in the fact that a reverse in\nsign under stress noticeably altered the calibration factors.\nThis problem was not solved by linearization of the calibration\ncurves, but the errors were still acceptable when measured\n\n4\n\ni\ni\n\nsa\n\nagainst demands.\nSince the demands on measurement technology have been substantially increased through new research tasks - especially in\nthe area of vibration reduction at the rotors - a fundamentally\nnew measurement principle was introduced for the balance technology.\nThis principle is based on the separation of dynamic and\n\n/7\n\nstatic portions of the force (Fig. 5):\n- measurement of the static forces via prestressed force\npick-ups\n- measurement of the dynamic forces through Piezo-force\npick-ups.\n1.1.2.1, Prestressed Pressure Gauges\nt\n\nA alteration in stress from push to pull causes hysteresis\n\n1\n\neffects at the pressure gauge, unavoidable because of the measure^u\n\nment principle and the zero passage. If the pressure gauges are\nprestressed (Fig. 5), however, this effect may be avoided. Two\npressure gauges were arranged for this purpose such that an\nattacking force does not cause a reversal of force at the individual gauge in the entire measurement range. Experiments with\ngauges prestressed for tension have the smallest error because\n\ny\n\nof an automatic aligning effect. When both pressure gauges have\nthe identical sensitivity, alterations in prestressing have no\nB\n\neffect on the characteristic of the double cell. This is of\ngreat advantage in the case of variations in temperature.\nThe principle of prestressing pressure guages is also employed in the DNW ground balance.\n1.1.2.2 Piezoelectrical Force Pick-Ups\nPiezoelectrical force pick-ups are quartz crystal measurement\n\n5\n.,\t\n\n..\n\nrf\n\nwashers. They convert a force into an electrical charge, because\nx\n\nthey produce an electrical charge if a disk of a quartz crystal\nis subjected to pressure. Such a piezo pick-up consists of one\nor two circular disks of a quartz crystal, an electrode and a\nhousing with a plug (Fig. 6). The force to be measured should\nact on the circular surface with an even distribution. An electrical charge is generated in the crystalline quartz through the\nmechanical tension, precisely proportional to the applied force\n\n/S\n\nl\n\nand not dependent on the dimensions of the quartz disks (longitudinal piezoelectrical effect).\nThe charge generated in this manner is transferred to the\nelectrode and fed to the plug connection. Polarity is selected\nsuch that a pressure force generates negative charges, then\nconverted in the so-called charge amplifier into positive voltage.\n\nk\n\nWhen the pressure is released on the measurement washer, a positive charge is produced if the negative charge previously generated\nby the stress has been destroyed by a short circuit at the plug\nconnector. The charges of the individual measurement washers\nare added by connecting several measurement washers in parallel,\nand the charge amplifier measures the total force. The opposing\nsurfaces at the measurement object must have a finely treated,\nsmooth surface and must be resistant to bending in order to\nachieve an even distribution of the measurement force on the\nannular surfaces.\nThe housing of a measurement washer is tightly welded, but\nthe plug with teflon coating is not completely sealed.\nPiezo pick-ups have the advantage of extremely high rigidity\nand have a dynamic range of up to six decades. There are three\ncomponent measurement value pick-ups, taking apart the components\nof a random force, thereby simplifying the construction of multiple component measurement equipment.\nPiezoelectrical pick-ups, however, have one large disadvantage: they are not suitable for the measurement of static quantities. When applying a static quantity, e.g. force, the\n\n6\n\n^f\n\n1!\n\nmeasurement value is first measured correctly, but the value is\nthen reduced of an e function where the time constant rt is\nsituated in a range of seconds up to hours. In order to apply\nthe advantages of the piezo measurement technology to the rotor\nbalance, the static forces and moments are measured with customary DMS force pick-ups.\nIdeal, piezoelectrical force pick-ups should only transmit\nan output signal if a force component is acting in the measurement\ndirection of the pick-up. Forces or moments normal to the measurement direction should not generate any output signal. In reality,\nforce pick-ups also transmit an output signal if a force acts\nnormally to the measurement direction. The output signal is\nf\n\nidentical to that of an actual -orce acting only in the measurement direction:\nThis phenomenon is designated as cross-talk. The example\nillustrated in Fig. 7 demonstrates this situation. In the appropriate construction of the piezo elements, cross-talk values of\nless than 1 % are achieved. The essential prerequisite for this\nvalue lies in the treatment of the quartz. The surfaces of the\nquartz plates for introducing the force must be situated within\nnarrow tolerances normal to the corresponding crystallographic\naxes.\nThe problem of cross-talk does not play a large role because of the insulation in the rotor balance, since the transverse\nforces are absorbed well through the ease of bending of the rods.\nFig. 8 shows the total design of the balance with the piezo pickups and the DMS pressure gauges. The rotor balance is presently\noperated in this configuration.\n1.1.2.3 Calibration of the Balance, Statically\nti\n\nThe calibration of the rotor balance is carried out in the\nsame manner as that of the fuselage balance. The reason for\nthis difference is that the calibration is less complicated and\nthe results are tested for accuracy.\n7\nv\n\n4\n\nSince the balance is employed bath for measuring static and\ndynamic rotor components, two measurement methods are employed.\nIn the first, the forces and moments are introduced into the plane\nof the rotor with calibrated weights, while the force isintroduced via one or two electrodynamic exciters in the other.\nIt is assumed in calibration that a linear relationship\nexists between stress and the measured values of the pressure\n\n/10\n\ngauges. This assumption is fulfilled in every case, as the\nexperiments have shown. Since the pressure gauges have a maximum\nspring path of 0.1 mm under stress, couplings resulting from a\nshift of the upper plate to the lower plate are not taken into\nconsideration.\nA very rigid frame with guide rollers is mounted on the base\nplate of the rotor balance. Force(", in the \xc2\xb1 x, * y and -z direction are introduced with calibrated weights via a cable attached\nat the rotor head. A rigid cross is attached at the rotor head\n\ng<\'\n\nadditionally for calibrating the moments, also suitable for suspending calibration weights. An equally large calibration weight\n\nl4fk\n\nis attached in the z direction to avoid both a moment and a force\nbeing introduced. Through this method, a pure moment is obtained\n\n^\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n4\n\naround the rotor head.\nCalibration was substantially standardized through the application of a computer. The calibrating weight and the resulting\nI,\nI\n\nstresses at the pressure gauges are stored in the computer during\ncalibration. After conclusion of a measurement series, a linear\nregression is undertaken. The rise of the curve is an element\na ij of the matrix A, i.e.\na\n\nj\t\n\nDZ (Fig. 9).\nDF\n\nThe matrix A_ therefore has 7 lines and 5 columns; an inversion is then not possible. Since two equations are linear combinations of the others because of the static overdetermination,\t\n\nH\n\'w\n\nthe system may be solved by the inclusion of the correction vector \t\n\nr\t\n\nC.\n\n/11\ni.\n\nC=\n\nA\n\nx\n\nF-\n\nZ\n\n^i\n\nS\n\n1\n\ny\n\xe2\x80\xa2n\xe2\x80\xa2r- . ^\'\t\n\nate.\n\ni\n\nORICImm\nOF POL%\'\t\n,\n\n"\t\n\na .^ \xe2\x96\xba\nI\n\ne\n\nX\n\nz2^\t\n\nF\n\nz\t\n\nr.\t\n\nr\t\n\nF z\t\n\no r ? -- ?^ \xe2\x80\xa2 F\n\nM^ I\n\nZ4\t\n\nI Y1 i\t\nI\n\n1\n\nI+Sy\n\ni\n\nY2\n^ Y\n\nf\n\nP\n\nI\n\nThe vector Z is determined such that C x C T reaches a minimum.\nThis procedure is design-:ted as the Least squares methods with\nthe boundary condition that the square sum of the errors of all\nseven gauges should approach a minimum. T \xe2\x96\xba,e procedure for cal-\n\nt\n\nculation of the forces and moments from the display of the\npressure gauges may be assumed as known, because this deals in\ns\n\ni\t\n\nthe final analysis with the solution of seven equations with five\nr\t\n\nA\n\nunknowns. A computer assumes this task for us.\nThe correction vector C indicates how the gauge forces are\nto be corrected in order to fulfill the equation system Z = A x F.\nC equals zero in the case of complete linearity. As the elements\nof C increase, the error in the calculation of the rotor components\nalso increases. The error threshold may be established up to\nwhich a measurement may still be employed. It can be seen that\nit may be very advantageous to have an overdetermined design\nstatically for the balance i.e. to install more pressure gauges\nthan required for the determination of the rotor components. It\nis disadvantageous that the rotor components may not be represented\non-Line, but only result after the solution of the equation system.\nSince the rotor must be held in certain stress limits during the\nwind tunnel trials, an immediate display of the rotor components\nis desireable.\nTherefore, a small analog computer was constructed, adding\nthe signals of two pressure gauges. This results in a square\n\n9\n\ni\ni\n\n# AA\n\nmatrix A with 5 lines and\n.+\n\n5 columns:\t\n\nF\n\nfir, ,r n\t\n\nq\n\nuY4\t\n\nr\t\n\n.a\t\n\ni\n\nOF\n112\nZ1\t\n\nZ2\t\n\n7?X\n\nZ3\t\n\nry\n\nZ4\t\n\n_ =ij\t\n\nor\t\n\nrz\t\n\nX1 + Y2\t\n\nZ\t\n\nAij\t\n\nF\n\nMX\n\nX\t\n\nr^y\nt\nt\n\nThis matrix A ij can be inverted, such that\nF\t\n\n:: Aii x Z\n\n^I\n\nTherefore, the forces and moments at the rotor head result from\nthe pressure gauge displays. \t\n\nThe errors resulting from non\'\n\nlinearities ar^, not taken into consideration in this case. \t\nis also\n\nnot\t\n\n31\n\nxj\n\nThis\n\nfor a quick look representation.\n\nt,.\n\nAn error resulting in the inclination of the rotor mast\nmust also be taken into consideration. \t\n\nSince the rotor balance\nprovides the forces and moments in faxed coordinates, \t the balance\nis also tilted upon inclination of the rotor mast such that the\nweight component of the constructions above the plane of measurement is included mainly as an x force. \t This correction is taken\ninto consideration in data evaluation.\n\nI\n{\nk\n\nR\n\n1.1.2.4\t\n\nCalibration of the Rotor Balance, \t Dynamically\n\nThe measurement of dynamic rotor components, \t\n\ni.e,\t forces and\n\nmoments dependent on time,\t is difficult because the locations\nof excitation and measurement are not identical.\t\n\nA transmission\n\nbehavior therefore results, primarily dependent on frequency and\nsometimes even dependent on force.\t\n\nthe amplitude and phase frequency characteristic would be indeper.-\n\nr\n\n\xc2\xb1`\n{r\n\nIf an ideal fixed connection\n\nwere to exist between the locations of excitation and measurement,\n\n10\n\n#\t\n\nt\n\nf\n\ndent of frequency. Such behavior is usually only achieved in a\n\nA\n\ncertain frequency range. The difficulty consists in constructing\na balance, not exhibiting any resonance points in all axes at n\n\n/13\nrotor frequencies (n - 1 ... S). In order to obtain information\t\non the frequency behavi,oAr of the rotor balance, there is possibility\nof solving the problem with a computer or of determining where\nthe inherent frequencies lie in a stationary vibration experiment.\nThe first method has the disadvantage that the distribution of\nmass and rigidity in the balance and the upper structures (rotor\nshaft etc.) must be determined, a very time-consuming proces\'s,\noften only providing estimations. The analytical, however, has\nthe advantage that the effect of modifications (conversions,\nFi\n\nadaitions) on the vibration behavior may be determined very\nrapidly.\nThe experiment on stationary vibration serves to determine\ninherent frequencies, inherent forms, the generalized masses of\nthe unattenuated system as well the determination of the actual\nattenuation of an elastic system. In the standard method, the\ninherent frequencies are determined by the phase criterium, i,e.\nthe response of the system is compared with the excitation. :;,f\nthe phase angle amounts to 90 0 , the system is vibrating in its\ninherent frequency, The system motion is usually determined in\nthis case with several acceleration pick-ups. In order to obtain\nthe most accurate inherent form, the location of attack of the\nstimulation should be adapted to the individual oscillation shape.\nIn the most unfavorable case, the force of excitation in uhe vibration node of an inherent form could be initiated with an exciter,\nso that this inherent form is not stimulated.\nMainly inherent frequency, inherent form and transmission\nbehavior were determined in the stationary vibration experiment\nwith the five-componentrotor balance. Pb e experimental arrangement may be seen in Fig. 10. The balance is connected to a very\nlow adjusted base via screws on a rigid frame. The electromagnetic vibration exciters are suspended on chains and direct the\nforce via push rods to the rotor head, represented here by a\nSubstitute mass.\' Short extensions are connected by screws to\n\n/14\n\n11\n-.V, -\n\nr\n\nthe substitute mass to permit additionally the initiation of moments. The exciters function in counter-phase in this configuration. The balance motion is measured with a total of 24 acceleration pick-ups. The signals are divided into the real and\nimaginary part in vector component meters and then processed by\na computer for further application. The representation of the\ntransmission behavior of the balance in the real and imaginary\npart has the advantage of better mathematical processing than\nin a phase and amount representation.\nFig. 11 shows the results from sweep tests. Two differing\nconfigurations were examined. Configuration 1 differs from con{\n\nfiguration 2 in a greater distance between the plane of the rotor\nhead and the measurement plane. The shift of the inherent frequencies to the right in the range of 10 - 15 Hz in configuration\n2 can be clearly seen. Of,covrse, in this type of test, the\n\na\n\ntransmission behavior of the balance is not yet determined;\nhowever, the sweep test provides a good overview of the dynamic\nbehavior of the balance.\nA pressure gauge is inserted between t\')e electro-dynamic\nexciters and rotor head for c!yramic calibration, providing the\namount and phase of the input signal. Output signals are amount\nand phase of the pressure gauges. For the balance configuration\n1 1 Fig. 12 provides an example of the ratio of the input signal\n(force FY) to the output signal (pressure gauge 1 to 7) in amount\nand phase. Since the rotor is operated with a constant blade\ntip Ma number (Ma tip = 0.62), other speed and therefore other\nharmonics are also produced with temperature and/or pressure\nchanges. This means that the transmission Functions of the balance must be constant in at least a certain frequency range\n(Af = \xc2\xb1 0.5 Hz) to avoid the necessity of too many calibration\nmatrices.\nCalibration matrises up to the 5th harmonic have been prepared for the real and imaginary part of the balance at the rotor\ntesting stand.\n\n12\n\nXa y^.\n\nq\t\n\n"*I\n\nIn the case of 5 forces and moments and T pressure gauges, \t\nthis results in TO calibration factors per frequency, i.e. a total\nof 350 up to the 5th harmonic. It can therefore easily be seen\nhow much data must be processed if the amplitude and phase in the\nrange under consideration did not remain constant.\nParallel to the measurements, a mathematical model of the\nbalance with upper structures was prepared.\t Fig. 13 provides a\nshort overview of the point -mass distribution employed for this\npurpose.\t For reasons of simpli f ication, only the transmission\nelements of the pressure gauges are considered as spring elements,\nwhile other elasticities are not taken into consideration. \t A\ncomparison between calculation and measurement provided satisfactory results, so the mathematical model is an aid in alterstions at the rotor balance for estimating the new inherent frequencies.\n\n/15\n\n/ +^\n\nIn order to achieve the required precision, however, the experimental determination of transmission function should not be\nneglected.\n^r\n1.1.3\t\n\nTorque Measurement Shaft\nWit\xe2\x80\xa2.\nate:\n\nThe torque measurement shaft is located between the upper\nplate and lower plate of the rotor balance. \t A DMS full bridge\nis attached on a shaft determining the torsion of a measurement\nshaft ( Fig. 14).\t There is a linear relationship between torque\nand torsion such that the moment may be indicated directly in\nanalog.\t The speed is determined from a sequence of rectangular\nimpulses and therefore is available in digital and analog form.\nThe product of speed and torque is indicated, as output in analog\nform.\n1.1.4\t\n\nMeasurement of Speed\n\nOne of the important quantities for data processing is speed,\nbecause this establishes the reference for almost all further measurement values. Especially the dynamic processes are related to\n13\n\n.,\t\n\n4\t\n\ny,g\n\nk+,I\nOF\n\nspeed. A total of four sensors of differing types are employed\n\n/16\n\nat the rotor testing stand for determining the speed:\n\nt\n\n- speed from the torque measurement shaft\n- direct voltage speed transmitter\n- electro-optical angular coder\n- annular potentiometer.\n41\n\nThe direct voltage speed transmitter is employed for measurements at the blade tip drive, because the torque measurement\nshaft does not supply any signal then.\nk\n\nThe angular coder indicates the momentary rotor blade position with relation to a defined zero position ( T = 0 0 ), in addition to the indication of rotating frequency. The coder transmits a digital signal to be directly processed in the computer.\nResolution is situated at 512 scannings per 360 0 , i.e. the rotor\nposition is indicated with the precision of 0.7 0 . This accuracy\nis necessary for the adjustment of higher harmonic signals, because a phase-accurate excitation is necessary for vibration\n\n^- a\n\nreduction at the rotor.\nThe ring or ramp potentiometer supplies a linear function\nover time to be reset to zero after each rotation (saw-tooth\nramp). This signal serves for setting the cycle of the data\nacquisition equipment and permits the temporal correlation of\nthe measurement signals.\n1.1.5 Measurement of Control Angle\nI\n\nThere are two possibilities for determining the control.\nangle: one consists in measuring the alterations in voltage\nat the blade rotary joint with the potentiometer; voltage and\nblade angle are dependent in a linear relationship on one\nanother. The other possibility leads to the control angles\nvia the position of the swash plate.\nThe swash plate is adjusted by the three electro-hydraulic\npositioning elements corresponding to the predetermined control\n\n14\n\ns\n\nangles at three desired value potentiometers. The conversion of\t\n\n!17\n\na\n\ncontrol angle in the positioning path is carried out via a solidly\ni\n\nwired analog computer. Inductive path pick-ups are attached to\nthe positioning elements, indicating the actual values of each\npositioning element. The return report is carried out through\nan inverse analog computer, calculating the actual values of the\ncontrol angles. The actual and desired values of the three control angles are displayed at digital voltmeters and recorded by\na computer. Since the translation ratio of both rotors differ\nbetween positioning path and blade angle, a separate circuit must\nbe provided for each rotor.\n1.1.6 Measurement of Temperature and Static Pressure\n\na\n\nCorrections in speed are necessary for the maintenance of\nthe Ma number at the blade tip when temperature and air pressure\nvary. In the range of 0\xc2\xb0 C < tc, < 30\xc2\xb0 C and 980 mbar ,^ \t\n\npO\n\n< 1040 mbar, the velocities are situated in the range of approx.\n-1\n<\n1000 rpm\n_ n Ro <c 1080 rpm -1 . These quantities clearly show\nthat it is necessary to monitor temperature and air pressure.\n\n^w\n\nOrdinarily, variation in air pressure is slight so that this\nIC\n\nvalue must be measured only once or twice on each measuring day.\nK\n\nIn contrast, the temperatures in the wind tunnel are altered\nvery rapidly, especially when high flow speeds are employed. It\nis therefore important to display the temperature in the control\nchamber and to record this or to provide the value for the desired speed.\n1.2 Sensors at the Rotor in Motion\nMeasurement pick-ups in the rotating system of the rotor\nare usually subjected to multiples of the load. Moreover, the\nwind forces are strong, varying greatly at high tunnel speeds,\nwhile the direction of flow at the sensors is constantly changing.\nIt can be seen that these measurement value pick-ups must be of\n/18\n\nespecially high quality.\t\n\n15\n\nA\n\nThe cables and plug connectors presented us with the most\ndifficul.ti.es ,\t often not sufficient for the alternating forces\n\n1\n\nfrom the flow.\t\n\nIt should be especially emphasized that the\n\ngreatest care is necessary when laying laced wiring harnesses\nand plug connections, because errors assumed to stem from the\nsensor are usually caused by contact defects in th,i electrical\nlines.\t\n\nThis is almost always the case if the sensor functions\n\n011\n\nfaultlessly at rest or with a slowly rotating rotor, but the\nsignal is defective as soon as the rotor reaches the prescribed\nspeed.\na\n\n1.2.1\t\n\nMeasurement of the Blade Angle\nt\n\nThe course of the blade angle:n time may be determined with\na precision potentiometer.\t\n\nThe control angles may be calculated\n\nfrom this course through an harmonic analysis. \t\n\nIt is important\n\nin this case to be able to correlate the angle of circulation of\ni\n\nthe blade to the local adjustment angle of the blade.\n.9\n\n,.\n\nThe potentiometer is connected by screws at the rotary\nA gear is located on the shaft, meshing\n\njoint of the rotor.\t\n\nf\n\nThe relative motion between gear and gear\n\nin a gear segment.\t\n\nsegment is proportional to the blade angle. \t\n\nThe potentiomenter\n\nweighs 20 g and is therefore well suited for the rotor. \t\n\nThe dis-\n\nadvantage of this measurement set-up is that the play between\nthe gear and gear segment distorts the results, since only a\nvery small measurement range of the potentiometer is utilized\nwhen setting the blade angle so that the gear play has excessive\ninfluence.\t\n\ns\n\nTherefore, another measuring principle will be em-\n\nployed in the future.\t\n\nA resistance element\t (s^,e Fig.\t\n\n15) will\n\nbe fastened directly to the rotary joint and the alteration in\ntension when setting the angle measured via a slip ring. \t\n\nj\n\nThe\n\nentire measurement range can be utilized because the length of\n\na\n\nthe conductor path can be adjusted precisely to the rotor re-\n\n1`\n\n\'i\n\nlatonships.\t\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot yet report on the success\n\n/19\n\nof this measurement principle since no continuous trials have\n\nr\n\nbeen undertaken up to now.\n\n16\nw,\n....\t\n\n+ r ^ ,.e\'\t\n\n,\ny+,,^^\n\nI,\n\nyl/^1;Yt\' !^ es\xe2\x96\xba x\n\n"?^+ .,. i.\n\n\xc2\xb0r.+3\t\n\nTM.\t\n\n_....\t\n\ns\n\n,e^.w.:.n\n\n. .+\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n.\t\n\nrJ;\n\n1.2.2 Measurement of the Impact and Pivottin Moments\nIt is especially difficult in a ,jointless rotor to define\nmeasurement points for determination of the impact and pivotting\nmoments. In contrast to a rotor with joints where impact and\npivotting joint are clearly anchored and the moments are measured\n\na\n\nvia the angles,\nof a\n\n3ointless\n\nfictitious joint must be employed in the case\n\nrotor for impact and pivotting. Since no\n\nmay be measured\n\nin\n\nangle\n\nthis case because the transitions are continu-\n\nous, strain gauges are employed. Since the rotor blade does not\nonly vibrate in the first inherent form, \'all strains are measured,\nresulting from higher blade bending shapes at the location of the\nstrain gauge. In calibration, of course, these effects may not\nbe taken into consideration. These difficulties are the basis\nfor equipping all four blades with DMS at exactly the same measuring points. Therefore, it should be possible to obtain information on the accuracy of measurements.\nCouplings betwee\'G impact and pivotting result when setting\nthe blade angle; the couplings increase with size of the blade\nangle. These couplings are again separated\n\nin\n\nevaluation through\nAi\n\ncoordinate transformation, so that the moments are situated in\n\nt\n\na rotor-fixed coordinate system.\nDMS full bridges were fastened at the top and bottom (for\nimpact moments) as well as at the back and front (for the pivott\n\nting moments) on the blade neck, wired such that only blade\n\ni\n\nbending is measured.\nThe blades are calibrated as follows. The blade is inserted\nvertically to exclude strains from the weight of the blade. The\nforces are introduced via a defined lever arm. The relationship\nof applied moment is proportional to the electrical voltage of\nthe strain gauge. Hysteresis effects caused by an alteration in\nsign of the bending moment in the impactor pivotting direction\ncan be neglected. If it is demonstrated during calibration that\ncouplings exist between impact and pivotting or vice versa, the\n\n17\n\n/20\n\nblade must be turned around the axis of torsion until the couplings\nt\t\n\nhave disappeared.\n\n,\n\n1.2.3 Torsion Measurements\nThe torsion may not be measured directly at the blade because\nof the form and inhomogeneity of the blade neck. Rather, the\nstrains of the circulating control rods are taken as a measure\nfor the torsion of the blade. This measuring method is also\nnot free of defects, since the bearing friction and the reset\nforces from the torsion spring elements in the rotor head are\nincluded in the measurement. In the case of centrifugal force\nof 1 x 10 4 N, however, this is certainly not a Large value. The\nsignal/noise ratio is not very high because of the slight strain\n\nb\n\non the control rods, so that the results can be evaluated only\n\nP\n\nz\n\nwith loads > 5 N.\n\nY\n\n1.3. Equipment for Measuring Descending Wind\nMuch energy has been devoted to the area of descending wind\nmeasurement technology in recent years for comparisons between\n\n4 \'i\n\nix\n\ncalculation and measurement as well as for researching the rotorinduced flow adjacent to the rotor. Pneumatic 5-hole probe\'s were\nemployed for initial studies, later supplemented by hot-wire\np\n\nprobes.\nPositioning the probes via a shifting device was limited to\nthe y coordinate (see Fig. 16) \t\n\nJ\n\nThis shifting device is replaced\n\nin the next wind tunnel trials by a system covering a field of\n\n/21\t\n\n)\n\n5 m x 6.2 m, thereby reaching any random point below the rotor\ncircular area (see Fig. 17). Therefore, blockage in the wind\ntunnel flow will greatly increase in an enclosed measurement\npath, so that free flow measurements may have to be carried out\nwhere the shifting device can be mounted almost completely outside of the wand tunnel flow. Since the descending wind of the\nentire downwind cylinder of the rotor is to be measured, the\nprobe must also be positioned in the vertical direction.\n\n18\n\n,E\t\n\n^\n\nStrong farces are applied to the descending measurement\n\nX\n\nequipment through the blowing action, such that the individual\ncomponents must be strong, in turn disadvantageous for dynamic\nbehavior. Therefore, studies on the dynamic behavior of the\nequipment were previously carried out since amplitude size and\nthe position of the inherent frequencies may greatly distort the\nti\n\ndescending wind measurements. Especially when instationary flow\nmeasurements are to be carried out, the vibration characteristic\n\nXP\n\nof the probe mount must be known, because it cannot be seen from\nthe signals of the hot-wire probes which speed portions originate\nfrom the probe vibration. For this purpose, the probe mount is\nprovided with acceleration pick-ups for measuring the additional\n\na\nx\n\nspeeds after integration.\ni^\n\nThe adjustment device is moved in the x-y plane via step\nmotors, permitting exact positioning. The z adjustment is carried\nout pneumatically. The lifting height amounts to approximately\n\n^\t\n\nf\n\n1 m. After successful signal recording, the probes are automar\n\ntically driven into the next position.\n1.3.1 Distance Measurement\nThe distance of the probe to the blade is especially important for measuring the flow field, because a correlation with\n\n;` a\n\ntheoretical values is otherwise erroneous. Generally, the measurements are related to the plane of the rotor and not to the\nplane of the blade tip, leading to greater deviations only in the\nrange of the blade tip, amounting to up to 0.2 m for the 4 blade\nrotor. A simple possibility for determining the distance from\nthe blade to the probe is provided with a device consisting of\na very thin rod of low mass, travelling very slowly in the plane\nof the blade until the blade and rod touch. An impulse is triggered\nin this case, fixing the position of the rod and the downwind probe.\nThe plane of the rotor is applied as reference quantity. Condition for this measuring method is that the distance is always\nrelated to the same blade; however, this assumes a good track\naccuracy of the blades.\n\n19\n\n/22\n\nAnother possibility for determining distance is presently\nunder study. In this case, an opto-electronic principle is\nemployed. A laser, beam hits a blade and is reflected. A photo\ncell is driven until the reflected light is caught. The distance\nbetween photo-cell and laser beam is \t\n\na measure for the angle\n\nof reflection and therefore a measure for the local bending of\nthe blade. The accuracy of the measurement increases with dis-\n\ntance of the plane of the blade and plane of the measurement.\n1.3.2 Downwind Measurement with a P neumatic Probe\n\ng5\n\nMost downwind measurements have been carried out up to now\nwith a pneumatic 5-hole probe \t (see Fig.\t 18).\t This probe is\nespecially suited for measuring average values, \t because the\nlong hose lines\t (between probe and measured value acquisition)\nprovide excellent attenuation for the system. \t The probe may be\nguided into the main flow direction because of the large measureadment error with blowing action at an angle, but only the \t\njustment is possible and also necessary. \t The measured values a\nq\t\nare therefore onl y;^\t\tacquired if the pressure is equal between\nhole 2 and 4.\t This measurement principle has proven excellent\nbecause it is very accurate, hardly subject to malfunctions and\neasy to operate.\t The measured values are recorded with a customary camera.\t The level of liquid in the glass tubes is photographed,\t representing a measure for the pressure relationships\n\n1\n\nat the probe.\n\n}\n^\ni\n"\'\xc2\xb0i\n`\n\n.\n\n4\n\nOnly those signals are evaluated with the R angles situated\nin the range - 20 0 < R\t\n\n+ 20 0 , because the error is otherwise\n\ntoo great. The average values obtained with the 5-hole probe\nare suitable for checking results from simple computer models\nsuch as the impulse method or the blade element theory. Calculations based on a turbulance model may not be correlated with\nsufficient accuracy to the measurements, because the dynamics of\nthe flow away from the rotor, especially the position and distribution of velocity of the blade tip turbulance may not be\nmeasured by this probe. Nevertheless, it is not possible to\ndispense with this type of downwind measurement if it is necessary\n\n20\n\n/23\n\n+1\n\nto monitor signals from ether probes, such as hot-wire probes,\nfor measurement accuracy.\n1.3.3 Downwind Measurement with a Hot-Wire Probe\nThe hot-wire anemonetry has gained considerably in importance in recent years, because measuring flows with high velocity\n\n4\n\ngradients is especially important in instationary aerodynamics.\nThe disadvantage of this measurement principle is that it does\nnot permit non-contact measurements, such that induction takes\nplace from the sensor to the flow (Fig. 19).\nThe principle )f the hot-wire measurement technology consists\ns\n\nin the fact that a thin tungsten, platinum or platinum-iridium\n\nM\n}\n\nwire with a diameter of 1 to 15 m is heated electrically. When\nthis heated wire is introduced into a flowing medium, a certain\n\nf\n\namount of heat is drawn off per time unit, corresponding to the\nflow rate.\n\nThe heat drawn from the hot wire is a direct measure for the\namount of the flow rate in the simplest case of an incompressible\nflow at constant air temperature. Usually it is not taken into\nconsideration that the condition of the flow around the measuring\nwire is a\'t p red in various Re number ranges, thereby producing\nanother heat dissipation and also another temperature distribution\nover the wire cross-section.\nThe alteration in condition of the flow around the measurement wire as a function of the Re number is an explanation for\nthe fact that the hot-wire characteristic does not have a purely\nexponential character, but rather has sharp bends in the characteristic at certain Re numbers. The temperature distribution\nalong the hot wire of finite length attached at the probe mount\n(prongs), a function of the flow rate, is also not taken into\nconsideration.\nA zero point adjustment undertaken before the experiments\nshould be repeated often during measuring and compared with the\n21\n.^\xe2\x80\xa2sswr \'::+-tl..-^\xe2\x80\x9e^_...: ....--\xc2\xbb, ;.mss\n\n/24 E`\n\nare\n\n\t\n\ns y^\n\nAs\n\n7\'.\n\n4\n\nt\ni\n\noriginally adjusted value for checking t1ie measuring probe with\na\n\nrespect to contamination , damage or alteration in the air temperature.\nThe measuring instrument consists of a single or multiple\nwire probe with the appropriate electronicsp accomodated in an\n19" push-in unit. Each hot wire is connected with the electronics\nvia a cable of defined length. Amplifier, linearization stage;\nrectangular generator, digital voltmeter and power supply are\nrequired for each hot wire.\nThe best results are obtained with a probe having wires of\ntungsten core with platinum coating and a diameter of 5 m as\nwell as a cold resistance of 4-b ohms. This wire is superior in\nstrength to pure platinum wires. The permissible ve,\'.icity range\ndepends on the shape of the hot wire arrangement and amounts to\napproximately 110 m/sec in our case. The maximum dire temperature amounts to 300\xc2\xb0 C. Generally, the highest possible wire\ntemperature should be employed to achieve high sensitivity of the\n\n/25\n\ninstrument and to reduce the effect of air temperature alterations. Nevertheless, the temperature alteration of air, especially\nlarge at high velocities in the wind tunnel, must always be taken\ninto consideration when calibratin&; the probes. Therefore, a\nsmall wind tunnel was constructed (V max " 80 m/sec) and provided\nwith a cooling and heating device (temperature range: 0 0 -- 50\xc2\xb0 C).\nThis tunnel was designed such that the temperature deviations\nover the cross-section of the beam are negligible. The possibility of turning the probe in the beam also makes it possible to\nestimate interference effects especially well, playing a role\nparticularly in multiple-wire probes. Calibration curves are\ndetermined for various temperatures and flow rates (U[V] =\nf(t[\xc2\xb0 C], V ... [m/sect).\nThese curves are available as measured values. With the aid\nspline interpolations, intermediate values of temperature and\ntunnel velocity may be determined, then taken into consideration\nin evaluations.\n\n22\n\nt\n\nUp to now, downwind measurements were carried out below a\n.t\n\n4 blade rotor and the 2 blade reaction rotor with a single-wire\n\nor a double-wire probe. The results will be reported at a .later\ntime.\n2. Data Processing and Evaluation\nData processing (signal recording, transmission,\n\nachieved great importance in modern\nThe main reason is that much data is to\n\npreparation\n\nand display) has\n\nexperimental\n\ntechnology.\n\nbe measured\n\nsimultaneously in most cases and that these data depend greatly\n\non time,\n\ni.e. they are not static. Moreover, the demand is pre-\n\nsented that a decision may already be made at the experimental\n\n;r\n\nlocation on the gctalty of the recorded measurement data, so that\n\n!a\t\n\nexperiments need not be repeated. Monitoring numerous sensors\n\n}\n\n"26\n\nalso belongs to the area of data processing just as does the\nmost rapid possible display of conditional quantities (quick look\ndisplay). Since the amount of data in extensive experiments is\nespecially large and therefore difficult to interpret, the data\nare presented on a display scree,,. in easily understandable representation after appropriate preparation. For example, time\nsequences are better represented immediately in frequency range\nand stress quantities not indicated as number, gut rather as\ncolumns of variable length with the appropriate limit value.\nEfforts were also made in recent years at the rotor testing\nstant to evaluate and present important measurement data during\nthe experiments\t\n\nFig. 20 shows data acquisitioLi and evaluation\n\nas they exist presently at the rotor testing stand, as well as\nthe new data processing equipment, available in hardware but\nstill in the preparation stages in the software packages.

The higher harmonic control\ncannot be carried out without a high capacity control and monitoring computer unit.\t\n\n,.-t\n\n2.1 PCM Unit\nData acquisition is carried out alm it exclusively via the\nPCM unit. The digital signals arra stored on an analog tape to-\n\na;\n\ngether with other auxiliary signals important for subsequent\nevaluation at the large-frame computer.\nE\nOn the basis of the spatial separation of the rotor testing\nstand in the measurement path of the wind tunnel, on the one\nhand, and the data recording equipment in the measurement chamber,\non the other hand, a high-performance telemetric instrument had\nto be created, The time-multiplex procedure (PCM, pulse code\nmodulation) is superior to the frequency-multiplex procedure\nbecause of fewer disruptions and defects in comparison to the\nanalog data transmission systems.\n\ni\n\nAnalog signals may already be disrupted by slight external\nvoltages. The disturbing effects act in analog procedures caused by the system or externally - on the entire measurement\n\nchain including\n\nthe transmission path. Digital procedures,\n\nworking with binary code, i.e. only with two different electrical states, for example pulse or no pulse, or in voltage\nlevels, for example 5 volts or 0 volt, remain uncritical as\nlong as the disturbing effects are situated at least 6 dB below\nthe useful. zignal. Signal regeneration at the receiving point\ncompensates for distorsions in impulse shape as well as differences in level of 20 % and more. The analog processing of\nacquired input signals is concluded with the analog/digital\n\ncon-\n\nversion.\nWhile the continuous analog representation permits infinitely\nmany values within the range of presentation, there is a finite\nand defined number of discrete values differing from one another\nin the digital presentation, determined by the number of the\nsmallest ranges of digitalization. The quantization or conversion error necessarily occurring in this case is precisely known\nand can be maintained so small that it is situated far below the\ncustomary inaccuracies of analog measurement technology and instrumentation. A resolution of 10 bits, i.e. 2 10 = 1024 amplitudes steps) then signifies an accuracy of 1 0 /oo, i.. one volt\nsignal level is resolved with 1 mV. Further noticeable errors\ndo not occur in transmission, storage; etc.\nThe analog measured values of the sensors situated in a\nparallel position in the rotating system are scanned sequentially\nin time in the commutator (multiplexer) and converted via an A/D\nconverter\t\n\ninto a bit parallel data flow (Fig. 21). In order\n\nto correlate the signals correctly later, a synchronous word\nis added to the data flow in the encoder in equal intervals.\nDigital information may also be added. The transmission of\nthe pulse flow, now serial, is carried out via a slip ring,\nsince a wireless transmission proved insufficient because of\nthe many rDssibilities for disruptions causes by reflections in\nthe wind tunnel. Then follow the bit synchronizer (bit cycle is\n25\na,-\t\n\nvrsi.... *r\t\n\nten.\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\n- -- -\t\n\n-\n\n/28\n\nii\n\nextracted), frame synchronization and serial/parallel, digital/\nanalog conversion and quick look representation of the analog\ni\n\nsignals.\nSerial bit flow from the rotor head PCM equipment as well\nas the base PCM equipment are written together with the periodically recorded synchronous words on a track of the magnetic\ntape. A third track is required for recording the experiment\nnumber (language track).\n\ni\n\nDuring playback, the signals stored on tape are read by the\n\n/29\n\nplayback head and amplified. The frame and word synchronization\nE\nf\n\nas well as the regeneration of the serial PCM signal is carried\nu\n\nout with the aid of the synchronization character added during\nrecording (as well as circulation impulse and start impulse).\n\n+\t\n\nThe digital/analog conversion follows the serial/parallel con-\n\ni\n\nt\n\n4\n\n4\n\nversion. The data of measured values are available in digital\nform at the exit of the PCM decommutator and, provided with word\naddresses and transfer information, are processed directly in a\ncomputer.\nUp to now it was possible to process the signals from 32\nchannels when the PCM equipment on the rotor head and at the\nbase had 16 channels each (15 free channels, one channel for the\nsynchronous word). The new equipment processes 34 channels each.\nThe main Errors, occurring in the application of the PCM equipment, are caused by the amplitude resolution (10 bit) and the\nscanning rate per measurement channel, resulting at a defined\nbit rate (scanning or aliasing error). Up to now, 16 channels\nwith 62.5 kbit/sec each were scanned, so that only vibrations\nup to the 5th rotor harmonic could be evaluated in the recommended\n5 times scanning.\n\np\n\n\'f\t x\n\nWith the new PCM equipment, signals up to 140 Hz can be reproduced with a maximum bit rate of 500 kbit/sec, corresponding\nto the 8th rotor harmonic. Maintaining this value was considered\nan important requirement in the definition of the new rotor head\nPCM equipment.

The command to move to a certain position\nwhere the downwind is to be measured is carried out manually or\nby a computer (LSI-11) according to a previously determined\nmeasurement program. The alignment of the probe in the averaged\nmain direction of flow through variation in the adjustment and\nshifting angle ( a ,s ) is carried out via a regulator, also giving\nthe signal for recording the data from the three hot-wire anemometers. An immediate evaluation of the measurement signals is\ncarried out in the computer via the PCM equipment. Mainly position and velocity components are to be recorded immediately and\nplotted.\n2.3 Presentation of the Results\nThe experiments in the wind tunnel are carried out in\n\na\n\naccordance with a previously defined experimental program. This\nessentially contains variations of the control angle; adjustment\nangle and wind tunnel velocity.\nAdjusting these parameters requires constant monitoring\nof the rotor loads, thrust and moments being the most important\nquantities in the 4 blade rotor. In the case of the doubleblade rotor, it is better to monitor the forces at the rotor.\nMonitoring is carried out through simple analog display instruments with scaled load limit range.\nAll other sensors measuring the load quantities also require\nmonitoring. For example, the static and dynamic signals from the\npressure gauges are presented on small monitors. A possible\noverload of the rotor balance is indicated in time by limit value\n27\n\nti\n\nsignals, All measurement channels from the PCM equipment may be\ncalled for in sequence in order to obtain information on possible\nsensor defects. These signals may also be viewed at the monitor\non a double-channel frequency analyzer in the time or frequency\nrange.\nA completed experiment is ,recorded on tape. Several selected\nquantities are plotted and later joined to an experimental series\nin the case of one determined parameter each (specifically,\nwind tunnel velocity and angle of rotor adjustment). Very simple\ntendencies or trends may be determined then from the sum of the\nmeasurement points.\n3. Measurement Container\nThe rotor testing stand is controlled and monitored from a\ncontainer. Radio communications exist between the container\nand measurement chamber of the wind tunnel in order to exchange\nnecessary information on the course of the experiment rapidly\'.\nAt least three persons are required in the container itself:\n- for steering the rotor\n- for supervision\n- for recording the data.\nSince almost all control and monitoring components in the\ncontainer are supported on vibration metals, only slight work\nis required to secure the equipment for transport. This is\nespecially important for the mobility of the equipment.\n\n28\n\n/31\n\n\t\n\nOF POUIR\n\n/32\n\n400\n\n^\\ 1\t\n\nC\nScheibe\n\na\n\nSoil\n\n3600\n\nT\nb Weggeber\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\n100MM\t\n\nloo rnr,7\n;3-\t\n\n286mm\n7r\n\nd\nZugfeder\n\nFig. 1: a Ro Adjustment - Linear Pick-Up of the\nAngle of Rotation.\nKey: a.\nb.\nc.\nd.\n\ncable\npath transmitter\ndisk\ntension spring\n\n29\n\npn\t\n\nw\n\n30\n\nFhd^eOP^V^. 1n\t\n\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\x9e.\t\n`ygi\n\nx.\n\nO\n\xe2\x80\xa2 rl\n\na^\n\n9..\n\nN\nU\n\nr\ncd\nw\n\nO\n\nU\n\n4D\n\nO\n4H\n\na\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2rl\nP--I\n^\n\n^\nCt\n\n^\n^r\no\n\nbD\n\nU\n\xe2\x80\xa2rl\n\nx\n\ni\n\na\n\n4-,\n\n0\n\n0\n\na\n\nbo\n\nP\n\nO\n\ncd\n\nto\n\nS\n\nO\n\nc^\n\n4a\n\na,\n\n0\n\n4\n\n^4\nO\n\ncd\n\n4-)\n\nN\nbQ\n\nw x\n\nii\n\nr\t\n\nw\nk\t\n\nG\n\n.c\n\nn\n\nk\n\n4 ^\npp\n\ntr\n\n,\n=E`\t\n\nI\n\nII\nn\n\nf^\n\nf }\n\nr\t\n\n^\n\nf\n\ni\n\nFig. 3: Modified Rotor Balance.\n\n31\n\n\t\ni\'\ne\n\nC3 ^tt Gn\nt NAL\n^ ^] (^\n.\n\nqn.4 - I\n\n1\n\n1\nd+\n\n4 M\n^\n\njl\n\nA\n\n..,.1\t ^\t\n\n1\n\ni\n!\n\n.^+^ wl.Ilbn\n\n7nwa\xe2\x80\xa2i\n\nK\xe2\x80\xa2I .7\n\n!A_\n\nrN^^\n\nL ft\n^^\xe2\x80\xa2\nI, 17\n\nC.
