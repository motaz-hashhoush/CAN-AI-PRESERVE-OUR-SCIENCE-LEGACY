Although great progress has been made, there\nremain several key problems where more data are required to constrain modelling, both empirical and thermodynamics-based. Here I will focus on several areas with implications for meteoritics and planetary science, including systems\nof low fO2, constructing models that include both metal and silicate for mantle melting and differentiation, high pressure phase equilibria relevant to full range of silicate mantles, and core-mantle equilibria where H and O are specified,\nand their effects are measured.\nSolar nebular oxygen fugacity is very low compared to Earth and Mars. Portions of the nebula, represented\nby aubrites and enstatite chondrites, for example, equilibrated at fO2 as much as 6 to 8 log fO2 units below the IW\nbuffer [1]. At such low fO2 conditions, Fe is almost entirely reduced to metal, S will partition strongly into silicate\nmelts, and some multi-valent elements such as Cr, V, Ti, Mo, W, will be stable in their lowest valence form. All these\nfactors will substantially affect phase equilibria and element partitioning at the low fO2. Very little experimental work\nhas been completed at such conditions, and is needed to make modelling robust, and to calibrate predictive expressions.\nDifferentiation of small bodies such as Vesta involves stabilization of metallic iron from molten chondritic\npre-cursor material, and segregation of the metal to the core where it equilibrates with the molten silicate mantle. This\nprocess includes equilibration of metallic liquid with silicate liquid, followed by solidification of the metal and silicate\nin the core and mantle, respectively [2]. Models exist for the metallic systems and the silicate systems, but there is\nstill not a model that includes metal and silicate together, thus allowing an integrated treatment of differentiation that\nincludes metal and silicate both. Efforts should be made to join these two systems, so the differentiation process can\nbe modeled end to end with a single modelling approach. Such a model would, of course, also be applicable to\naubrites, angrites, and other such small differentiated bodies.\nModelling of phase equilibria in planetary mantles has made substantial progress in the last few decades.\nPredicting mantle mineralogy and mantle phases crystallizing from early partially or fully molten mantles, however,\nrequires additional experimental data to constrain the phase equilibria of certain compositions, and the volumetric\nproperties of melts at high pressures. For example, the compressibility of peridotitic liquids at high pressures is based\non limited data on komatiitic liquids and is not of sufficient resolution to allow confident prediction of behavior of\nFeO [3]. Thus, our understanding of FeO and Fe2O3 in deep planetary mantle \xe2\x80\x93 which potentially help to control the\nfO2 of planetary interiors and their interaction with the atmosphere \xe2\x80\x93 is currently limited [4]. Effort should be focused\non determining volumetric properties of FeO- and Fe2O3-bearing silicate melts at high pressures to allow more robust\nmodelling.\nPlanetary cores. The last several decades have seen advances in knowledge of phase equilibria in planetary\nmetallic liquids in the Fe-S-C-Si systems, with a solid understanding of this 4-component system across a wide PT\nrange [5]. Two additional elements \xe2\x80\x93 H and O - are stable in metallic cores, yet very little work has been completed\nwith these elements included. Hydrogen may be moderately siderophile at high pressures, and even a small amount\ndissolved in the core would have significant implications for the phase equilibria and for H budget of a given planet\n[6]. While not siderophile, oxygen could nonetheless be soluble in Fe metal in several wt.% , thus having potential to\ninfluence phase equilibria and element partitioning [7]. Even though H and O pose experimental difficulties, efforts\nshould be made to study them in more detail at conditions relevant to the terrestrial planet interiors; this would allow\nmor realistic modelling of planetary cores.\nReferences: [1] Righter, K. et al. 2016.
