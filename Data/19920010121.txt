As part of this endeavor, UHCL\nproposed a partnership with JSC to jointly define and manage an integrated\nprogram of research in advanced data processing technology needed for JSC\'s\nmain missions, including administrative, engineering and science responsibilities. JSC agreed and entered into a continuing cooperative agreement\nwith UHCL beginning in May 1986, to jointly plan and execute such research\nthrough RICIS. Additionally, under Cooperative Agreement NCC 9-16.\ncomputing and educational facilities are snared by the two institutions to\nconduct the research.\nThe UHCL/RICIS mission is to conduct, coordinate, and disseminate research\nand professional level education in computing and information systems to\nserve the needs of the government, industry, community and acadcmia.\nRICIS combines resources of UHCLand its gateway affiliates to research and\ndevelop materials, prototypes and publications on topics of mutual interest\nto its sponsors and researchers. Within UHCL. the mission is being\nimplemented through interdisciplinary involvement of faculty and students\nfrom each of the four schools: Business and Public Administration, Education, Human Sciences and Humanities, and Natural and Applied Sciences.\nRICIS also collaborates with industry in a companion program. This program\nis focused on serving the research and advanced development needs of\nindustry.\nMoreover, UHCL established relationships with other universities and research organizations, having common research interests, to provide additional sources of expertise to conduct needed research. For example, UHCL\nhas entered into a special partnership with Texas A&M University to help\noversee RICIS research and education programs, while other research\norganizations are involved via the "gateway" concept\nA major role of RICIS then is to find the best match of sponsors, researchers\nand research objectives to advance knowledge in the computing and information sciences. RICIS, working jointly with its sponsors, advises on research\nneeds, recommends principals for conducting the research, provides technical and administrative support to coordinate the research and integrates\ntechnical results into the goals of UHCL, NASA/JSC and industry.\n\nTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT:\nA Partnership That Makes Sense\n\nPreface\nThe United States, along with other nations of the world, finds itself in an increasingly\ncompetitive world economic environment. U.S. organizations have instituted major efforts\nto increase their productivity as well as the overall quality of their output. These needs\nplace a premium on the development of collaborative efforts among appropriate organizations to develop and apply "cutting edge capabilities" in critical categories of technology.\nIn this paper, the authors discuss an approach for how academic institutions, government entities and industrial organizations can work effectively to utilize their relative\nstrengths to more effectively meet common goals. They relate this to an evolving UHCL\nRICIS program to bring about this type of triad in the Clear Lake Area.\nThe views and conclusions contained in this report are those of the authors and should\nnot be interpreted as representative of the official policies of IBM Corporation, UHCL,\nNASA or the United States Government.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Problem\n\no\n\nRounding Out th0 Picture\n\n/\\\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\np*rs ^fr^s\n\n7\n\n- (W^A\nLHCL\n\n8\n\nT szlUi1\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n7\n\n8\n\nSummary\n\n9\n\nIntroduction\nAll too often we in government, industry and universities, find ourselves developing\ntechnology on a basis of perceived needs rather than being driven by specific needs. While this\napproach has its place, it can be a very wasteful approach in the area of applied research. This\nproblem is compounded when groups across several organizations such as government\nagencies, industrial entities, and university groups are involved.\nHistorically it has proven difficult to bring together these distinctly different organizational\ncultures such that the benefits of collaboration are realized. However, evidence exists that\nthere are advantages of cooperative efforts among professionals from academe, government\nand industry. There are a reasonable number of examples where effective collaboration of\nacademe, government and industry have produced benefits ranging from significant to\nastonishing. One such example is the Land-Grant U.S. Agricultural System; this structure,\ncomprised of government, academe and the agribusiness community is given credit for\ncreating the most efficient and productive agricultural system in the history of mankind.\nDriven by need, organizations of the Clear Lake area formally initiated an effort in 1986 to\nbring academe, government and industry together to develop a long term focused research\nand professional level education program in "computing and information systems."\n\n(1)\n\nThe Problem\nTremendous advancements in materials research, development and in the engineering of\nhardware components and systems for computing and information systems have been\nrealized in the last four decades. On the other hand, the capabilities of mankind to engineer\nthe instruction sets, commonly referred to as "software systems", have not kept pace with\nhardware development.\nMoreover, the education programs required to produce software engineers are only now being\nseriously discussed. Adequate education programs to convert some percentage of the existing\nbody of software practitioners to improved software engineering methodologies are similarly\nlacking.\nTo make effective use of cutting edge concepts, methods, and technologies in a timely way,\nthe "concepts/methods" of academe need to be understood and supported by the "technology\nimplementers" of industry in concert with informed requests by government agencies. The\nproblem, then, is to determine how to recognize a specific need and focus the necessary\nresources from multiple institutions on fulfilling the need, without compromising the\nindependence of the institutions.\n\nA Specific Approach\nIn 1986 the University of Houston-Clear Lake (UHCL) formed the Research Institute for\nComputing and Information Systems (RICIS) as part of a cooperative program with NASA\nJohnson Space Center to jointly define and manage an integrated program of supporting\nresearch and professional level education in the computing area. Since its inception, RICIS\nhas been responsible for more than 27 million dollars of research. RICIS has functioned as\norganizer and manager of a gateway to research organizations in universities and industry as\nwell as conducting a significant portion of research and education activities with UHCL faculty\nand staff.\nRICIS attempts to serve as a clearinghouse of research ideas, cutting edge methodologies and\nconcepts, and software technologies that are, or should be, of interest to NASA; it facilitates\nthe research selection process; it coordinates the selected efforts as they are conducted; and\nit disseminates the results.\nImportantly, RICIS utilizes the gateway mechanism to explore the applicability of already\nexisting research results to critical NASA needs (examples include research conducted by the\nMicroelectronics and Computer Technology Consortium (MCC) and the Software Engineering\nInstitute at Carnegie-Mellon University) and so helps facilitate the transfer of technology and\nknowledge into NASA.\n\n(2)\n\nThe RICIS program is attempting to build on the strengths of government, academe and\nprivate industry to take advantage of computing and information systems know-how and\ntechnology for the benefit of all participating organizations:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nto create an environment to foster "continuing, working-level, people\ninteractions",\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nto "remove mystique and build mutual understanding and trust\namong participating university, NASA and industry staff and\nprofessionals",\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nto identify and incorporate incentives to encourage this outreach,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nto build mechanisms to better effect knowledge/technology transfer/\ninfusion between universities and government,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nimportantly, to avoid using universities as substitutes for industrial\npartners.\n\nRICIS has adopted the "proven" government/university "Land Grant" model as the foundation\nconcept for its program. NASA has adopted the "Cooperative Agreement" as the contract\ninstrument to implement this program. Both NASA and UHCL/RICIS are as concerned about\nthe "process" as well as the "content" of this collaborative effort.\nAlready a considerable amount of research results/knowledge and technology/know-how\nhave been produced in the U.S. and around the world that needs to be better understood,\nappreciated and exploited (technology insertion). Hence considerable effort can be productively\nspent towards gaining the benefits of applications research.\n\nRounding Out the Picture\nRICIS provides a necessary mechanism to work with government to plan and oversee needed\nresearch and professional level education. Figure 1 depicts a simple model of the NASA/UHCL\ncooperative association. The missing element is the view of industry, i.e., the government\'s\ncontractors, who ultimately have the responsibility to insert technology into NASA\'s programs.\nWhile NASA and UHCL from the outset have envisioned industry as a third important element\nof the RICIS program, the initial emphasis was placed on developing the university/\ngovernment link. RICIS is now in a position to encourage industry to be a major partner in\nthe program. A current major thrust is to develop this important element.\nFollowing considerable dialogue between RICIS and various aerospace organizations, UHCL\nand IBM recently entered into a new partnership agreement. This is viewed as the first step\nin creating an "Industrial Affiliate component" of the RICIS program involving a number of\ninterested industrial organizations in the Clear Lake/Houston area. The agreement covers\nfive basic areas of cooperation as follows.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIBM. as the first Industrial Affiliate, will help UHCL define how\nindustry can help carry out the RICIS role. The initial thrust is to\n(3)\n\nAPPLICATION\n\nOTHER\nUNIVERSITY\nRESEARCH\n\nFIGURE 1 \xe2\x80\xa2 NASA/UHCL RELATIONSHIP\n\nserve in an advisory capacity on a planning board structured for this\npurpose. Other Industrial Affiliates will be invited to serve in a similar\ncapacity.\nIBM will assist UHCL/RICIS in providing a series of credit and noncredit classes in the area of Project Management to the RICIS\ncommunity at large.\nUHCL/RICIS and IBM will conduct cooperative research in the area of\nGroup and Organizational Analysis. Initially, this will concentrate on\ninterviewing techniques in support of Information Engineering,\nKnowledge Engineering, and Management Consulting.\nUHCL/RICIS and IBM will investigate other areas of joint interest for\npossible collaborative work (e.g., Space Station Data Management\nSystem, image processing and engineering of reusable software\ncomponents).\n(4)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIBM will assist UHCL/RICIS in bringing other Industrial Affiliates into a\ncollaborative program.\n\nThis thrust adds a new dimension to the model already established. A view of the new\nrelationship is presented in Figure 2.\n\nAPPLICATION\nMANAGE USE\n\nMANAGEMENT\nADVICE\n\nKNOWLEDGE,\nPOOL\nTRAINING\n\n.\xc2\xa3..=-=.=.\xe2\x80\xa2=\xe2\x80\xa2_=. /-<\nPROTOTYPING\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nINSERTION\nFIGURE 2 \xe2\x80\xa2 NASA/IBM (PROTOTYPE INDUSTRIAL AFFILIATE)\n\nThe final step is a formal interface between IBM and NASA. Such an interface exists already\nin the form of contracts which govern the work that IBM does for NASA. These contract\nrelationships can be used to recommend and accept technology insertion based on prototyping\ndone in support of research accomplished through the RICIS/NASA relationship. Hence, the\nRICIS industrial affiliate program will provide the missing link between the existing NASA/\nIBM contract relationship and the NASA/UHCL cooperative relationship. This provide\nclosure for all the relationships required to generate and evaluate research for the NASA\ncommunity. All of the required interfaces are shown in Figure 3.\n\n(5)\n\nAPPLICATION\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nINSERTION\n\nRESEARCH\n\nFIGURES \xe2\x80\xa2 NASA/IBM RELATIONSHIP\n\nA General Mode!\nIn general, the industrial contracting community needs to function in the role to be prototyped\nwith IBM in the academe, government, industry triad. One could replace IBM with industry\ncontractors and this model works well as a cooperative model for NASA, UHCL and industry.\nIf we look beyond this specific situation we see, moreover, a general model of cooperation\namong any government agency, or major customer, and its university and industrial\ncounterparts. This general model is presented in Figure 4.\n\n(6)\n\nAPPLICATION\n\nEVALUATE\n\nPROTOTYPING\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nINSERTION\n\nRESEARCH\n\nFIGURE 4 \xe2\x80\xa2 GENERAL COOPERATION MODEL\n\nPerspectives\nNASA\nThe initial stimulus for the joint NASA/UHCL cooperative program was a recognition by JSC\nof a need for a forward-looking, longer-term engineering research and continuing education\nprogram in the rapidly evolving fields of computer and information sciences and engineering.\nJSC, as a major space engineering center and a major developer and user of computing and\ninformation systems, has a clear need to stay at the forefront of the concepts, methods and\ntechnologies rapidly emerging from these fields. In 1984 the Mission Support Directorate of\nJSC began an effort to formulate and plan for the initiation of such a supporting research and\ncontinuing education program. That program included provisions for the UHCL to create\nRICIS -- an "institute without walls".\nWhile the total program represented by the JSC/UHCL Cooperative Agreement NCC 9-16 is\nbroadly based on the computing and information fields, much of the attention and efforts of\nresearch and education has been directed to issues of the newly emerging field of software\nengineering. Many of us at JSC strongly believe that we need to be at the forefront of modern\nsoftware engineering methodologies and practices if we are to achieve NASA\'s missions and\ngoals.\n(7)\n\nUHCL\nThe primary mission of a university is education. In order to stay abreast in educating its\nconstituents, a university must establish and maintain a strong research component. The\nClear Lake community is a science and engineering community with ever increasing demands\nfor advanced computing and information technology. With this in mind, UHCL, in the early\n\'80\'s, set out to encourage NASA/JSC and local industry to provide support, including sharing\npersonnel and facilities as well as contributing funds, for research and education in\ncomputing and information systems.\nThe resulting discussions led to UHCL establishing RICIS in cooperation with NASA/JSC. As\npointed out previously, RICIS is now positioning itself to establish stronger ties with the\nindustrial community. With the \'triad\' in place, the community will be better served by the\nuniversity.\nImportantly, the university will derive tremendous benefits as well. The expertise of faculty\nand professional staff will be further developed by exposure to complex problems. The faculty\nwill have the opportunity to stay at the cutting edge of research and contribute to the scientific\nbody of knowledge. The results of the research will find its way into the classroom enriching\nthe educational experience. Moreover, such a relationship will provide research as well as\neducational seasoning for UHCL students.\nA relationship involving UHCL with industry and NASA, and potentially other government\nagencies, will lead to establishing new degree programs as the needs of the community are\nbetter understood. An example is the newly established master\'s degree program in software\nengineering science. RICIS was a major factor in establishing the rationale for getting the\nneeded support for developing this program.\n\nIBM\nResearch is essential if an industry is to remain viable. However, topics for research are many\nand the money to be invested from profits is not adequate to cover all of them. By participating\nin RICIS, IBM can direct funds into topics based on the needs of the agency that it primarily\nserves in the Clear Lake area. Access to research directed by RICIS also enables each\nindustrial affiliate to not duplicate work already performed by others and invest in complementary work.\nWork with UHCL gives IBM access to research skills in the university to complement its own.\nIt also gives IBM access to training associated with research of interest. IBM also provides\nprototyping opportunities in real projects to prove the value of technology under study at\nUHCL through RICIS.\nFinally, since IBM is a NASA contractor, it can react sensibly to technology insertion requests\nin NASA RFP\'s if prior prototyping has been accomplished through the RICIS mechanism.\nThis final contracting mechanism completes the picture of cooperative research: the need for\nthe research, a conducive atmosphere for its completion, prototyping to show viability, and\na mechanism for inserting the technology into programs.\n(8)\n\nUHCL\nThe primary mission of a university is education.

We feel that this is a necessary mechanism if the institutions involved\nare to maintain their technical vitality. Each of the interfaces must remain independent to\nmaintain a healthy counterbalance of the respective entities. However, each entity can and\nmust understand the entire mechanism to exploit each interface to the fullest. Only through\nsuch cooperation can the continued technical success of the NASA/Clear Lake area be\nassured and continue to contribute to the technical acco plishments of the nation as well.\n\n(9)\n\nCopies of this publication have been deposited with the Texas State Library in\ncompliance with the State Depository Law.\n\n'
