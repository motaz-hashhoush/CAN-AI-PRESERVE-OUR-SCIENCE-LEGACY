A simplified model of the shuttle response during the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) buildup was constructed. The model included the effect of stick-slip friction for the rotation of the skirt about the spherical bearing. Current finite element models assume the joint is completely frictionless in rotation and therefore no moment is transferred between the skirt and the hold down posts. The model was partially verified against test data and preliminary parameter studies were performed. The parameter studies indicated that the coefficient of friction strongly influenced the moment on the hold down posts. The coefficient of friction had little effect on hold down post vertical loads, however. Further calibration of the model is necessary before the effect of friction on the hold down post horizontal loads can be analyzed.", "title": "The effect of friction in the hold down post spherical bearings on hold down post loads", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910009693, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Richardson, James A."}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama Univ.", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "ac459efa332942ddbd713f3941ab211f"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910009693, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910009693, "id": "db9bef3f98a54f55b295838bdde003d5", "publicationName": "Alabama Univ., Research Reports: 1990 NASA(ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program", "publicationDate": "1990-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910009693.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910009693/downloads/19910009693.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910009693/downloads/19910009693.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910009693/downloads/19910009693.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
