b'Space Technology\nGame Changing Development\nMaterials Genome Initiative Element\nNASA is committed to developing new materials\nand manufacturing methods that can enable new\nmissions with ever increasing mission demands.\nTypically, the development and certification of\nnew materials and manufacturing methods in the\naerospace industry has required more than 20\nyears of development time with a costly testing\nand certification program. To reduce the cost and\ntime to mature these emerging technologies, NASA\nis developing computational materials tools to\nimprove understanding of the material and guide\nthe certification process.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) element\nis a multi-center effort within the Advanced\nManufacturing Technology project, which is funded\nby the Game Changing Technology Program,\nmanaged by NASA Langley Research Center.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s MGI element is consistent with the national\n\nMaterials Genome Initiative, which was announced\nby the office of the President in 2011. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s effort\nis currently focused on developing computational\nmaterials tools to reduce the cost and time to\ndevelop and certify components manufactured\nusing novel additive manufacturing processes for\naerospace vehicles. Additive manufacturing allows\nfor near net shape processing to reduce material\nwaste, and time and cost of traditional, subtractive,\nmanufacturing.\nNASA is developing physics-based computational\nmodels to predict the melt pool, where powder\nor wire precursors are heated by a laser to form\na solid component, the microstructural evolution,\nand material behavior. These tools will be used\nto develop basic understanding to optimize\nthe manufacturing process and to guide the\ncertification process.\n\nPhysics-based models of powder consolidation,\nin-situ monitoring of the melt process and 3D models\nof the thermal history are used to predict material\nevolution and material behavior.\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nGeorge C.
