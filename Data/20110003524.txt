The laser\nablates the coating, typically consisting\nof PVC, Teflon, Mylar, etc., and the\nlaser beam reflects off the copper,\nleaving the underlying wire\nundamaged. Unlike traditional contact\ncutting methods, which can lead to\nproduct damage, the laser produces\nclean results.\n\nThe wire stripping application in the\nphoto to the left was accomplished by\nscanning a 0.6" x 0.15" area with a\nSynrad FH "Index" marking head and\n25-watt laser. Two passes of the laser\nwere used at a speed of 40" per second\nand a resolution of 350. The process\nwas then repeated on the other side of\nthe material, resulting in a cycle time\nof 2.3 seconds per side.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Laser Marking Plastic Automotive Parts\nSealed CO 2 lasers are ideal for\nmarking text, bar codes, and serial\ncodes on a wide range of plastics. The\ntype of plastic, absorption of the laser\nbeam, and power used will determine\nthe type of mark that can be created on\nthe material.\nMarking is achieved by either\nengraving the material or by creating a\ncontrasting mark on the surface.\nEngraved marks are produced when\nthe laser actually removes material,\ncreating a depression. Contrasting\n\nmarks are produced by either surface\nmelting or by surface discoloration via\na chemical reaction of the material to\nthe laser beam, usually requiring less\npower than engraving.\n\nEngraved marks can be created on\nplastic parts using just 10-watts of laser\npower.\n\nThe engraved alphanumerics on the\nplastic automotive part in the photo to\nthe left were created using a Synrad\n10-watt laser, marking head, and\n125mm lens. The marks were made at\na speed of 5" per second and a cycle\ntime of 0.75 seconds, using a spot size\nof 180 microns.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Laser "Engraving" Polyester Fleece\nThe pile of this polyester fabric can\nbe selectively removed to create a\npattern or logo on the material with no\ndiscoloration. An alternative to\ninterweaving the pattern into the\nfleece the laser offers manufacturers\nexcellent flexibility on logo positioning\nand design.\n\nDiscover more CO2 laser applications!\nSign up for our\nonline Applications Newsletter at\nwww.synrad.com/signup1\nAll applications on this page were\nprocessed at SYllrad\'s Applications\nLaboratory.

Hewlett-Packard\nused ALGOR\'s Mechanical Event Simulation (MES) software to\nanalyze the behavior of the magnetic recording tape as it is wound\nthrough a Hewlett-Packard LTO Ultrium back-up drive.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nA Hewlett-Packard engineer, Paul Poorman, modeled the magnetic\ntape with isotropic shell elements and the drive assembly using\nkinematic elements. In the MES, the tape wraps around two rollers\nand across a tape head and is then pulled into a take-up reel. The\nMES results showed the motion of the tape and resulting stresses.\nThese results helped Hewlett-Packard find a proprietary solution that\nkeeps the tape on track while reducing stresses on the edge of the\ntape, thus extending the life of the back-up tape. Paul Poorman\nreports, "The first generation of Hewlett-Packard Ultrium drives is\ncurrently in the market and performing well."\n\nHewletl-Packard\'s challenge was to optimize the LTO drive to\nincrease tape durability while maintaining tape path stability. To study\nthe tape\'s behavior, the software had to simulate motion, contact\nbetween parts in an assembly, large displacement, elastic material\nbehavior and stresses.\n\nUSA/Canada\n1.800.48.ALGOR\n\nALGOR.\n\nFor this complete story and others , visit\nhptapedrive .ALGOR.com\n\nautodesk\nauthorirtd dwf:loper\n\nALGOR, Inc.\n150 Beta Drive\nPittsburgh, PA 15238-2932 USA\nPhone\n1.412.967.2700\nFax\n1.412.967.2781\n\n--~-\n\nAll trademarks may be trademarks or registered trademarks of their respectIve owners.\n\n...\n\nhptapedrlve@algor.com\nhptapedrive.A LGOR.com\n\nFor Free Info Circle No. 513 or Visit www.nasatech.comJ513\n\nFrance\n0.800.918.917\nItaly\n800.783.132\nSingapore\n800.120.3775\nUnited Kingdom\n0.800.731 .0399\n\nContents continued\n@\n,9\xc2\xb7\n\nPhysical Sciences\n\n62\n63\n\nAircraft-Mounted Cloud-Water-Content Probe\n\n64\n\nMiniature NMR Spectrometers Without Magnets\n\n66\n\nBooks and Reports\n\n66\n66\n\nI\n\n62\n\nMEMS Design Optimization With FEA\n\n66\n\n~otlonk 70\n~\n\nMaking Hydrogen by Electrolysis of Methanol\n\nFurther Developments Regarding Noise-Reducing\nSlots in QWIPs\n\nPRODUCT\n\nON\n\nTHE\n\nCOVER\nThe DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)\nrotary blood pump, developed at Johnson\nSpace Center, was named NASA Commercial\nInvention of the Year for 2001 .

As the\nrotor electrode in the distributor rotates, the discharge between it and the electrodes that send current to the park\nplugs create a high-frequency ignal, cau ing ignition noi e.\nTo combat this problem , Toyota has developed a multiplelayer electrode that reduces ignition noise and resists deterioration that can lead to noise creeping back in. The electrode\nis comprised oftwo layer, each composed ofa metal oxide resistor and dielectric. The second layer feature gl"eater resi tivity than the first, enabling a lower di charge voltage, which\nin turn reduces ignition noi e. 0 additional material or\ncircuitry are required to reduce ignition noi e level, and Ie s\nexpensive material can be u ed to replace conventional\nceramic electrodes, cutting material and labor costs.\nGet the complete report on this technology at:\nwww.nasatech.com/techsearch/tow/toyota.html\nEmail: nasatech@yet2.com\nPhone: 617-557-3837\n\nHigh-Speed Replicator Synchronizes Data\nUpdating Between Relational Databases\n\nHoneywell\n\n-\n\n"...~\n\n...\n\n. . . . .

Researchers at Johnson Space\nCenter in Houston, TX, received the\nNASA Commercial Invention of the\nYear for the Rotary Blood Pump Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) . NASA\'s\nGovernment Invention of the Year\nAward went to a team from Glenn\nResearch Center in Cleveland, OH, for\ndeveloping both a Hollow Cathode\nAs embly for the International Space\nStation Plasma Contactor and Hollow\nCathode Technology for commercial\npurpo es. Although these innovations\noriginated from ASA research centers, each has the ability to benefit a\nmuch wider range of industries.\n\nRotary Blood Pump ventricular Assist Device (VAD)\nNASA\'s entry into blood pump technology began on a personal level. A\nASA engineer uffering from congestive heart failure met with famed pioneer heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey\nwhile receiving a heart transplant. As a\nresult of their discussion, a team of\nNASA engineers and contractors was\nformed to apply the expertise gained in\nsolving space exploration problems to\nbenefit people with congestive heart failure. The partnership led to the development of the DeBakey Ventricular Assist\nDevice (VAD), a small, lightweight, highspeed turbine pump that moves blood\nwithout damaging the delicate individual blood cells or allowing clotting of the\nblood - the two principle obstacles in\nblood pump technology.\nThe VAD includes a tubular housing\nthat has an externally mounted motor\n30\n\nstator, an internally fixed flow straightoperation, the turbine pump is powered\nener within its upstream section, and a\nby batteries and has an external patientdiffuser fixed within its downstream secoperated controller.\nThe VAD is utilized in three distinct\ntion.

Unlike the Oliginal Canadarm,\nwhich is mounted just outside a shuttle\'s payload bay, each end\nof Canadann2 has a hand that can grap an anchor on the I S.\nB" nipping end-over-end between anchor points. Canadarm2\ncan move around tlle IS like an inchworm. To install the\nrobotic ann for use on the ISS, uperbolt 1uItiJackboit tensioner were used on eight bolts to hold Canadann2 in place\nduring launch.\nThe tensioners are designed to replace conventional hex\nnllts, covered nuts, and bolts. They were chosen because they\nareimple to remove with hand tool and were able to achieve\nlIle bolt prcloads required for lIle launch. This is an important\nconsideration in keeping space-walking astronauts safe and\nreducing the launch weight since no heavy tooling is required.\nCanadann2 was can\'ied to lIle IS via the pace Shuttle\nEndeavour.

Technology Focus: Data Acquisition\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Remote Monitoring and Alarm System\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nThe Remote Monitoring and Alarm\nSystem (RMAS) is a system of electronic\nhardware and software for monitoring\nof fiber-optic video transmission equipment at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).\nThe RMAS could also monitor other\nequipment that generates discrete contact closures and/ or analog voltages.\nT he hardware includes multiple remote\nterminal units (RTUs) that are collocated with, and gather both discrete and\nanalog information from, the monitored\nequipment, and convert this information to RS-232 data streams. The RTUs\nare connected via point-to-point longhaul modem circuits to a 9frport code-\n\nactivated switch (CAS), that, in turn,\nconnects specific RTUs to a monitoring\ncomputer workstation. Polling software\nrunning on the workstation periodically\ngathers data from each RTU and stores\nthe data for processing by network-management software, which also runs on\nthe workstation. The network-management software analyzes the data to generate a graphical representation of the\nfiber-optic video transmission equipment, with indications of any alarm conditions. Each RTU contains custom\nfirmware that govern communication\nwith the polling software and that, upon\ncommand by a user, implements diag-\n\nnostic routines. A Simple etwork Management Protocol agent links the\npolling software to the network-manager\nsoftware via a custom management information base.\nThis work was done by Philip Gvozd,\nMatthew Smisor, and William Toler of\nKennedy Space Ce nter and Chris Kerios, Robert Chiodini, Pamela K.

The e devices were conceived for use on spacecraft,\nbut might also be useful on terrestrial autonomous underwater vessels or terrestrial\nremote exploratory robots. The concept\nwas motivated by the need to learn from\nmission failures in order to make future\nmissions more failure resistant\nEven more than aircraft "black\nboxes," the propo ed devices would be\nextremely rugged to survive re-entry into\nthe atmosphere of the Earth as well as\nimpacts substantially harder than those\nof airplane crashes. Unlike aircraft\n"black boxes," the proposed devices\nwould not be designed to be retrieved:\ninstead, they would be designed to transmit as much pertinent information as\npossible to enable analysis to identify\nspecific causes of mission failures.\nThe design of the proposed devices\nwould follow a "spacecraft within a\nspacecraft" approach. The device would\ncontain data-handling, telecommunication, power-supply, and structural subsystems. The primary interfaces between\n34\n\nthis system and the pacecraft would be\npower connections and points of access\nto the spacecraft data bus and/ or the\nspacecraft telemetry-management ystern. The links between the failure-reporting device and the spacecraft would\nbe subject to severance at any time. However, even while the spacecraft remained\nintact and functional with the device\nconnected, the device would tran mit\nsubcarrier beacon tones that would convey information on the status of the\nspacecraft during high-ri k maneuvers\nlike entry, descent, and landing.\nUpon separation from the spacecraft,\nthe device would stop drawing power\nfrom the spacecraft power supply and\nstart drawing power from an internal\nbattery. Once separated from the spacecraft, the device would automatically\nbegin transmitting relevant data back to\nEarth ground stations and/ or nearby orbiting spacecraft. A flight-qualified data\nprocessor would run the software necessary to record channelized data, set the\nbeacon state, and execute other functions like those of an aircraft "black\nbox." The level of data processing would\nwww.nasatech.com\n\ndepend on the degree to which the data\nreceived by the device were summarized\nand otherwise preproce ed by the\nspacecraft data-processing ystem. The\nmo t important data would be stored\n(most likely in a solid-state memory)\naboard the device for tran mi ion.\nThe telecommunications and software\nsub ystem of the device would generate\nlow-rate telemetry signal to transmit\nstored engineering data. If po ible\nwithin the processing constraints, ummarization software would transmit the\nmo t relevant sen or data recorded\naround the time of the failure. The subcarrier signals could be programmed to\ncorrespond to spacecraft failure modes\nand would provide orne indication of\nstatus in the event that acquisition of\ntelemetry was not po ible.\nThis work was done by E.

This approach has been\npainstakingly slow, but very rewarding in\nterms of obtaining specific information\nabout the gene being studied. With the\nannouncement that the entire sequence\nof the human genome has been identified, the rush is on to utilize the vast\namount of information now available.\nThere are an e timated 80,000 to\n100,000 unique genes encoded within\nthe human genome and in order to determine the various function of all of\nthe e gene , cienti ts are actively developing methods to analyze many of\nthem in parallel. This tack makes numerou new and interesting experiments possible, like identifying all the\ngenes that are changed in re pon e to a\nbiologically active molecule such a a\nhormone or a drug.\nWhile much of the early work in this\narea has relied on data-collection methods that employ erial scanning, new\nprotocols based on digital imaging are\nnow proving highly successful. Recent\nadvances in electronics technology and\nnew methods of high-volume manufacturing are making it possible for\nlla\n\nbuilder of microarray scanners to affordably integrate advanced CCD imager as components in their y tern .\nOn a smaller scale, it i even pas ible\nfor individual re earchers to u e currently available camera sy tern for microarray imaging experiments in their\nown laboratories.\n\nMeasu:I\'eanent of Gene\nActivity\nIn order to measure a gene \'s activity,\ncientists collect the me enger RNA\n(mRNA) , which carries information\nfrom the gene in the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is usually translated\ninto a protein product. When the RNA\nfrom a cell population or tissue is collected, this preparation i typically converted into copy DNA (cD A) and then\namplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) . A sample of the amplified\ncDNA product can be labeled with fluorescent tags to allow that population to\nbe identified.\nTypically, the researcher u es two\npopulations of cells: one representing\nthe control and one representing the\nexperimental treatment. As an example, a cultured cell line\'s response to\nin ulin can be mea ured by preparing\ntwo cell populations: one trealed with\n\nwww.ptbmagazine.com\n\ninsulin and one mock treated. The\nRNA from the in ulin-treated cells can\nbe labeled with Fluor 1 (green color)\nand the RNA from the control cell can\nbe labeled with Fluor 2 (red color) .\nThese probe can then be used to interrogate a microarray of immobilized\nD A targets on a gla surface, where\neach (x,y) coordinate represents a\nknown DNA equence.\nWhen the green and red probe are\nhybridized to tlle array, the compo ite\ncolor is a measure of the gene activity\nratio. A green color would indicate a\ngene that i on Witll insulin treatment\nand off when insulin is absent. A red\ncolor would indicate a gene that i on\nwhen insulin is absent and off with insulin treatment. A yellow color would indicate a gene that does not change significantly with in ulin treatment.\n\nBasic Analytical\nApp:I\'oaches\nOnce the array have been hybridized\nand washed under the appropriate tringency condition , the user needs to read\nthe arrays at two different wavelengths of\ninterest. The wavelength used are u ually in the red region of the spectrum to\nreduce auto-fluore cence from the system.

Two basic approaches can be utilized to measure these signals: serial\nscanning or imaging.\nIn the serial scanning approach, a\nconfocal fluorescent scanning device\ncollects data serially using a common optical pathway for delivering the excitation beam and for collecting the emission beam. The fluorescent signal is\nmeasured by a photomultiplier tube and\ndigitized to generate the output intensity at each spot on the microarray. Mter\nthe first fluorescent channel has been\nmeasured, the optics are switched and\nthe second channel is then measured.\nIn the imaging approach, a wide-field\nillumination scheme is utilized to\nachieve parallel excitation on most or all\nof the microarray. Similarly, the imaging\nof the whole array then occurs in parallel with an exposure time chosen to obtain the be t signal-to-noise in the data.\nA camera digitizes the data and all of the\ndigital data is delivered to the computer\nin an image format. For the second\nwavelength, the optics will need to be\nchanged and another exposure taken.\n\nScanning Vs. lanaging\nSo which is the better method for analyzing this kind of data? Right now,\nthe majority of the microarray canners\non the market employ the serial scanning approach. This is due to the simplicity of design of a system that uses a\nlaser for illumination coupled with a\nPMT for a detector. In terms of performance, however, there are distinct\nadvantages to moving to an imagingbased approach.\nFor example, in selecting laser lines\nfor illwnination in serial scanners, the\nfluore cent probes become confined to\ntho e whose excitation pectrum is sufficiently overlapped with the laser line to\nbe useful. In the imaging approach,\nbroadband emitters like xenon (Xe) or\nmercury (Hg) can be used to generate\nan almost continuous usable spectrum\nof illumination light.\nFurthermore, by using a CCD-type detector to measure the fluorescence signals, an imaging device can achieve quantum efficiencies on the order of 90% versus the 15-20% QE obtainable with a\nPMT-type device. This difference translates into a sensitivity advantage of up to\nsixfold I The CCDs can also be run with\nvery low-noise analog electronics to\nachieve a readout noise lower than 4 erms, whereas the PMTs can have noise\nterms that are significantly higher.\nAnother key advantage of the imaging-based approach is the highly paral2a\n\nM icroarray image showing typical differences in gene e xpression levels. Image c ourte sy\nof Roper Scientific, Inc.\n\nleI nature of the data collection. If the\nuser needs to collect 5,000 data points\nin one experiment and 20,000 in another, the scanning approach will require four times longer for the second\nexperiment than the first. In an optimized imaging experiment, both measurements will be under identical exposure conditions and so the time will be\nequal. As the number of elements in an\narray increases, the advantage of imaging over serial scanning becomes more\npronounced.\nConversely, one of the arguments in\nfavor of serial scanners over imaging\ndevices is the former\'s ability to achieve\na larger number of effective pixels. This\nability is u eful for the currently accepted standard of mea uring each 100micron D A spot with a 10 x 10-pixel\narray, a practice tllat yields 70-80 (on average) individual valid measurements\nwithin the circular spot. The rationale\nfor obtaining this highly oversampled\ndata is that it enable the interpreting\nsoftware to derive detailed statistics on\nthe variation from spot to spot a well as\nto use tllis information to qualify the\nquality of the data in the spot. While\nthis method does indeed give me software a good idea of the uniformity of\nwww.ptbmagazine.com\n\nthe distribution of the ignal across the\nspot, it really does not add res the core\nissue of whether or not the data is useful or quantitative.\nIn all biology, the standard manner to\nensure me usefulness or validity of the\ndata is the replicate method. Every biochemical as ay is done in at least triplicate. Every plate-based as ay i done in at\nleast duplicate. The variation across\nreplicate or triplicates is defined by the\ncoefficient of variation; thi number\nplaces a boundary on me usefulness of\nthe data. The same principle should be\napplied in the microarray field, that is,\nall spots should be represented at least\ntwice on each microarray and these\nspots should not be in the same region\nof the array. This approach eliminates\ntlle need for the high level of oversampiing employed with serial scanning.\nUnder these conditions, the finite number of pixels on the CCD is no longer a\nlimiting factor.\nThis article was written I7y Mark Christenson, Ph.D., Senior Scientist, andJeffGrant, Senior Technical Writer, a.t lWper Scientifu, Inc.\nThe autlwrs can be reached at mchristenson@\nrojJerscientific.com and jgra.nt@roperscientific.\ncom.

Moreover, it should be possible to integrate readout electronic circuits directly\nonto the device; these circuits would perform all needed intermediate signal processing to generate electrical output indicative of the angle of incidence of the\nlaser beam on the device. In one potential\napplication, the beacon would be located\nat one end of a free-space optical-<:ommunication link and would be used as a target for aiming a transmitting tele cope located at the other end of the link. In\nanother potential application, the beacon\ncould be used similarly as a target for meauring angle precisely in land surveying.\nThe device, denoted an optical pointer\non a chip (OPOC) , would be divided into\nfour quadrants, each of which would contain a wave plate in series with a blazed\ntran mis ion-type diffraction grating, a\nFabry-Perot etalon serving as a resonator,\nand a photodetector (see figure) . Each\nwave plate would transform the circular\npolarization of the laser beam into the linear polarization optimum for the blaze of\nthe grating in its quadrant A complete explanation of the principle of operation\nwould entail a great deal of mathematical\nderivation and, as such, would greatly exceed the space available for this article. In\nsummary:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The device would exploit the sharp dependence of the transmissivity of a\nFabry-Perot resonator on the internal\nangle (~) of refraction or diffraction.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The spatial period of the diffraction\ngrating would be chosen so that normally incident light would be diffracted\nto a desired order inside the resonator\nat a desired angle ~.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The blazes in the opposite quadrants of\nthe grating would oppose each other in\nsuch a manner as to select opposite diffraction orders (e.g., the +jth and the\n-jth) in opposite quadrants.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The net result of the aforementioned\nfeatures is that the currents generated\nin the photodetectors in opposite\nquadrants would respond antisymmetrically to a deviation of the laser beam\n\nlOa\n\nAngle of Incidence in x-z Plane\n\n\\\nCircularly _ _\nPolarized Beam\nOuadrantA\n\np\n\n: 1/4-Wave Plate\n\nnl\n\n3/4-Wave Plate\n\nL-_!-_ _ _ _ _ _-\'-_ _ _ _ _ _ _ ____\'\n\nBlazed DiffractiO\nGrating\n\nOuadrantC\n\nV\n\nn2\n\nIndices of\nRefraction of ~ \xe2\x80\xa2 n3\nIndicated Layer \' "\nn4\n\n"-\n\nL Fabry-Perot\nEtalon\n\nL--+____\n\n~\n\n____\n\n~L_\n\n"\'" Mirror\n/Layers\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ____\'\n\nSIDE VIEW\n\n-Blaze\n\nA\n\ny\n\nt\n\nB\n\nBlaze\n\nt\n----..x\n\nt\n\nBlaze\n\n-\n\nC\n\nD\n\nBlaze\n\n\'1\n\n~----------~~+~~\n\n~ \xc2\xa7]\n\nDiscriminator\n\n...-------,\n,\nThreshold Bias\n\nClock\n\nif---.1-------I\n...\nEnable\n\n1 Output\n(Angle of Incidence in\nz-A-D Plane Proportional to\n\nI", -10\nI", + 10\n\n1\n\nTOP VIEW WITH READOUT CIRCUITRY\n\nThis Optical Pointer on a Chip would contain several well-known optical components in a unique\ncombination such that the currents generated in the photodetectors in opposite quadrants would respond antisymmetrically to a deviation of the laser beam from normal incidence.\n\nfrom normal incidence.

The antenna would be suitable for communication along both predominantly horizontal\npaths (e.g., with distant ground stations)\nand predominantly vertical paths (e.g.,\nwith atellites).\nThe radiating elements would typically be con tructed in one of three\nforms: (1) The elements could be vertical electric dipole on the rotor blade;\nthese would tran mit and receive in vertical electric polarization. (2) The elements could be horizontal electric\ndipoles along the blade, in which case\nthey would tran mit and receive in horizontal electric polarization. (3) The elements could be horizontal lots on the\nblade; the e would tran mit and receive\nin vertical polarization along horizontal\npath, horizontal polarization along vertical paths, and intermediate polarizations along intermediate path. Horizontal dipole or lots would ordinarii\nbe preferable to vertical dipole because\nthey would cau e Ie s perturbation of\nthe rotor-blade aerodynamics.\nThe rotary coupHng could be any of\neveral noncontact rotary waveguide\njoints ( ee figure). The tator in the rotary coupling would contain a numb r\n(n) of input/ output probe equal to the\nnumber of rotor blade (typically, n = 5),\npo itioned at equal angular interval. The\ninput/ output prob in the stator would\nbe connected to a beam-forming network\nconnected via a coaxial cable to the radio\nequipment in the fu elage. The beamfonning network would be configured 0\nthat \\vithin the waveguide joint, th radiation would be coupled from the probes\n(in tran mitting) or to the probes (in reeiving) in the de ired waveguide mod\nwith n-fold azimuthal ymmeu)\'.

As the rotor\nturned, the rotor probes would pass\nthrough the stationary n-fold symmetric\nwaveguide mode. This would cause the\nradio-frequency power coupled between\neach rotor-blade radiating element and\nthe stationary radio equipment to vary\nwith the instantaneous angle of rotation, so\nthat the radiation pattern traced out by\neach radiating element alone during one\ncomplete rotation would exhibit n-fold\nymmetry. However, because there\nwould be n blades, thi pattern would be\n\nspatially modulated with another n-fold\nsymmetry characteristic of the spatial relationships among the n radiating elements. A basic theoretical analysis shows\nthat the net effect of the rotating and\nstationary n-fold ymmetries would be to\nproduce a predominantly azimuthally\nsymmetric (nonrotating) far-field radiation pattern.\nThe vertical polarizatio.n along horizontal paths in the case of horizontal-slot\nradiating elements would be desirable for\ncommunication with ground-based terminals from low altitude.

The rotor-blade modulation for\nthis antenna would be limited to that as-\n\nsociated with variation in the antennaelement/airframe coupling, with extremes when the center line of the fuselage is aligned with a blade and when it\nis aligned halfway between two blades. It\nhas been conjectured that this modulation would be small in comparison with\nthe modulation associated with the usual\nblockage effects.\nYet another advantage would lie in the\nvariation of the phase of the modal radiation pattern with azimuthal angle. Depending on which mode is excited, the\n\nrelative phase of a received signal could\nprovide a direct measure of the azimuthal\nangle of arrival of the signal. Thus, while\nproviding omnidirectional coverage in\nazimuth, this antenna could also be used\nfor azimuthal direction finding.\nThis work was dcne by Rimald J Pogorzelski of Caltech for NASA\'s J et Propulsion\nLaboratory.

As u ed here,\n"nonaligned antennas" does not signify antenna that lack alignment;\nrather, it signifies antennas that generally point in different directions (in\ncontradistinction to antennas oriented\nidentically as in prior methods). The\nmethod is applicable to a land vehicle,\naircraft, spacecraft, ship, or almost any\nother vehicle.\nFor the purpo e of this or any other\nmethod of determining attitude from\nGPS measurements, the positions and\norientations of the antennas with respect to the vehicle and to each other\nmust be known . In general, the attitude\nof the vehicle, referenced to lines of\nsight between the vehicle and a set of\nGPS satellites, is determined from differences among the phases of the GPS carrier ignals received by the various antennas.\nPrior methods of determining attitude from GPS measurements are\nbased partly on the a sumption that the\nantennas are oriented identically. This\nassumption simplifies attitude determination in the following way: CPS signals\nare right-hand circularly polarized\n(RHCP). In the case of identically oriented antennas, the effects of the circular polarization on the phases of the signals received by aU the antennas are\nequal; therefore, the phase-difference\nmeasurements and the attitude determination are unaffected by the circular\npolarization.\nWhen the antennas are nonaligned,\nthe phase effects of tl1e circular polarization differ among antennas, so that the\n42\n\nprior methods cannot be used. In the\npre ent method, these effects are taken\ninto account, making it possible to use\nnonaligned antennas for attitude determination. The major advantage gained\n\nthrough this method is that by using a\nsufficient number of antennas pointed\nin different directions, one can maximize the probability that a sufficient\nnumber of GPS satellites will be in view\n\n~~~~-SiX Channels per Antenna\n~\n\nAntennas Aimed in\nDifferent Directions\n\n1\n\nprea1Plifiersr-_ _ __ _\n\nGPS\nCarrier\nSignal\n\n.-.:~-\\-----\\_----\n\nRF\nSection\n\nProcessor\nCarrier-Signal Receiver\n\nReceiver\nCalibration\n\nDifferential-Phase\nCorrections for\nNonaligned\nAntennas\n\nResolution of\nInteger Cycle\nNonaligned-Antenna\nAmbiguity\nDifferential-Carrier- .....~I-----#--l\nPhase Detection\nUnit\n\nReal-Time\nAttitude\nSolutions\n\nPosition-Fix/Orbit I-_ _ _~\nPropagator\n\nGPS Almanac\n\nThe Attitude Module of a GPS Receiver runs software that makes differential-phase corrections for\nRHCP GPS si gnals received by nonaligned antennas.\n\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nNASA Tech Briefs,June 2002\n\nNo limit on sensitivity \xe2\x80\xa2 On expandability \xe2\x80\xa2 On versatility\nJust imagine what you could discover if you weren\'t limited by your instruments.\nKeithley\'s specialized and general purpose measurement solutions help scientists and engineers meet\ntomorrow\'s measurement challenges as well as today\'s.

Preferably, there are eight antenna and the radio-frequency (RF)\nection of the receiver can accommodate as many a six CP channels per\nantenna. The signal in the variou\nchannel are digitized, then sent to a\nproces or that includes a navigation\nmodule and an attitude module.

Thi oftware provides phase-difference correction\nba ed on the calculable effects of (l)\nthe known relative positions and orientations of the antennas and (2) the\npha e of the RHCP CP signal that\nthey receive.\nThe primary obstacle to incorporating the RHCP phase-difference correction into the attitude computations is\nthe fact that the attitude of the vehicle\nis embedded in expre sions of the ref-\n\nerence frames of the various antennas.\nA circular-reasoning condition ari e in\nthat to calculate the attitude, it is neces ary to know the RHCP corrections,\nbut to calculate the RHCP corrections,\nthe attitude must be known.

If no prior estimate of attitude\nis available, then an initial e timate can\nbe con tructed, for example, by use of\nthe line of ight from each antenna to\nthe source of the strongest CPS signal\nreceived on that antenna.\nThis work was done by Edgar Glenn Lightsey oj Goddard Space Flight Center.

Kennedy Space Center; Florida\nSome improvements have been made\nto enhance the role of water as a te t solvent for determining the amount of hydrocarbon nonvolatile re idue (NVR)\npresent on an item of hardware that is required to be totally or nearly devoid of\nsuch residue. Water is now used as an\nNVR-testing solven t because (1) even highmolecular-weight hydrocarbon greases are\nat least lightly soluble in water, (2) water is\nsafer and less expensive than are chlorofluorocarbon solvents [in particular, 1,1,2trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (also known\nas CFG1l3) , which was used previously in\ntesting for hydrocarbon NVR) , and (3)\nCFC solvents are expensive and are now\nrecognized as environmentally hannful.\nThe present improvements address two\nmajor aspects of the NVR-testing prot>-\n\nlem: (1) increasing the efficiency of removal of NVR from hardware by use of\nwater and (2) increasing the sensitivity of\nmeasuring the concentration of NVR dissolved in the water. Prior to these improvements, it was known that when small\nparts are subjected to ultrasound in a\nwater bath and NVR is present, the\namount of NVR dispersed into the water\nis ufficient to enable measurement of the\nconcentration of the dissolved NVR by the\ntotal-organic-carbon (TOC) method.\nThe present improvements extend the\napplicability of water-wash NVR testing to\nparts too large to fit in an ultrasonic bath.\nThe efficiency of removal of NVR from a\nlarge part can be increased somewhat by\nuse of steam or high-pressure spray of\nwater with or without a gas mixed in.\n\nHowever, the technique found to be mo t\nefficient (and least dependent on the ize\nof tlle part) is spraying water on the surface of the part from an ultrasonic nozzle.\nThe increase in the sen itivity of measurement i achieved by concentrating\nthe NVR from the wash water before attempting the measurement. For this purpo e, all of the wash water is made to flow\nthrough a bed of silica gel. During this\nflow, a significant portion of the di olved\nNVR becomes adsorbed onto the silica\ngel particles. Then part or all of the silica\ngel is analyzed by the TOC method.

In the application that inspired the hexfoil concept, there is a requirement for a limited-rotation mirror gimbal that would\nmaintain, with unprecedented accuracy,\ncoincidence among the axes of rotation\nand a fiducial mark on the mirror, over\nthe entire range of rotation. Theoretically, a hexfoil rotary flexure could satisfy this requirement.\nA hexfoil rotary flexure would offer the\nfollowing advantages over a nominally\nequivalent commercial rotary flexure:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A hexfoil rotary flexure would maintain a static center of rotation; in\nother words, it would be subject to no\nmore than negligible drift of the center of rotation.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The ratio between lateral stiffness and\nrotational stiffness (this ratio is regarded as a figure of merit for a flexural pivot) would be much greater.\nThus, a hexfoil would approximate an\nideal pivot more do ely.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An optimized hexfoil rotary flexure\ncould withstand a lateral load greater\nthan that for any similarly ized commercial flexural pivot.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A hexfoil rotary pivot would be made\nfrom a single piece of material. The\nmonolithic nature of thi device\nwould ensure the highest reliability.\nThe hexfoil rotary flexure i related to\nthe device described in "Trefoil Rotary\nFlexure" (NPO-20228) NA \'A Tech Briefs,\nVol. 22, No.8 (August 1998), page 68. In\ncomparison with a trefoil pivot, a hexfoil\npivot would have twice the angular range,\n\nA Hexfoil Rotary Flexure would feature a favorable load-bearing configuration and a high degree of symmetry, such that the application of\ntorque about the cylindrical axis would result in\nexceptionally pure rotation, even in the presence\nof axial and lateral loads .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 MicroStrain\xc2\xae\n\nM\n\nMicro Sensors.

A hexfoil pivot could be\ndesigned as a drop-in replacement for a\nstan dard Lucas (or equivalent) pivot, inasmuch as it has the same type of interface.\nA hexfoil pivot (see figure) would include two coaxial hollow circular cylinders that would constitute a rotor and stator. respectively. From each cylinder. three\nflexural elements in the form of thin\nplates spaced at equal circumferential intervals would extend radially inward. terminating at approximately the axis of rotation. More precisely. the plates attached\nto each cylinder would be parallelograms\n\nwith bases equal to the length of the cylinder. radial heights approximately equal to\nthe inner radius of the cylinder. and an\naxial slant distance of approximately half\nthe length of the cylinder. Thus. in effect.\nthe three flexural elements from each\ncylinder would terminate in a line segment of length equal to that of the cylinder. coincident with axis of rotation. displaced axially from the cylinder by half\nthe length of the cylinder.\nTo complete the characterization. it\nshould be mentioned that the on-axis\nfl exure termination for each cylinder\nwould be displaced axially toward the\n\n1Hf ONlY WAY 10 ~fAll1 ~HU1\nI~ 10 rNfUMA-~fAlI1\nPneuma-Seal\xc2\xae inflatable gaskets are pressurized with air to fill\nthe uneven gaps between surfaces.

Furthermore. the flexural elements\nfor the two cylinders would be "clocked"\nrelative to each other such that each flexure from one cylinder would be coplanar\n(when not deflected) with one from the\nother cylinder. Hence. in essence. there\nwould be three contiguous flexure connecting the two cylinders.\nThe advantages of this configuration\nare the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The termination of the flexural elements would be brought as close as possible to the axis of rotation. thereby\nmaximizing the rotational flexibility\nwhile maintaining lateral stiffness.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Load paths through the device would\nbe aligned such that all translational\nloads would be carried as ten ion or\ncompression in the flexural elements\n(the stiffest and highest-load-bearing\narrangement possible). while a torque\napplied about the axis of rotation\nwould be reacted by simple bending\n(configuration of greatest compliance\nand least stre s) .\nThis work was done by Donald Moore and\nRobert Calvet of Caltech for NASA\'s J et\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Heretofore, such joints have been, variously, compact\nor reliable, but not both, for the following reasons: In all such\njoints, sealing is effected by compression of soft metal (typically, indium or alloy of indium) 0 rings between flanges .\nOver time, the soft O-ring metal flows, with consequent reduction of preload, sometime leading to loss of eal.

Consequently, many questions\nruise about how to pecify and ultimately\nverify the performance of the positioning\nsystem (s) that will guide the e microscopic elements successfully into alignment. Proper alignment is critical to asuring the long-term performance of\nfiber-optic components.\nPreci ion motion perfOlmance i usually discu ed in terms of "resolution," but\nin fact there are multiple performance attributes that must be addressed in order\nto be con istently successful in fiber-optic\ndevice alignment application. Thi article define key terms for motion yslem,\ndi cus es the importance of each with respect to this very demanding proce , and\noffers a method for pecifying motion systems in tenTIS of coupling 10 rather than\nmotion capability.\n\nO\n\nment applications requires closed-loop\npo itioning control with direct drive and\non-axis encoder feedback. As it turns out,\nBDR and MIM are linked which allows us\nto u e the approximation: BDR= +/ - MIM\nStability is the ability to maintain a constant position over a specified period of\ntime.\nOf the e four parameters, M1M (and so\nBDR) is the most significant when defining a motion system to achieve maximum\nfiber coupling. Because MIM relate to\nthe ability of the motion y tern to take\nsmaller step while earching for the optimal location, a stage with a mailer MIM\nwill theoretically find the highe t coupling point. In practice however, most\nfiber-optic device have coupling maxima\nthat are of much greater width than the\nMIM of the alignment tem. This means\nthat decreasing MIM beyond a certain\npoint will no longer have a measurable effect on the overall alignment efficiency.\n\nThe importance ofBDR is necessitated by\nthe device attachment application, which\nrequires the alignment system to (repeatedly) return a fiber to the position of maximum coupling d uring the attachment\nprocess.\nStability is also essential because after\nalignment the remaining teps, such as attachment, require the coupling efficiency\nto be held con tant over the period of\ntime needed for completion. Although\nre olution contribute to MIM, it is not a\ncritical parameter in fiber-optic device\nalignment applications. If a stage cannot\nmove in very small tep (MIM), even very\nhigh-re olution readings of po ition become irrelevant.\ntage pecifications such as MIM, stability and re olution are typically given\nper stage axis as if the tage was used b\nitself. ince fiber alignment ystem are\ncompo ed of many stages tacked together, tlle motion ystem mu t be pec-\n\nFundamental Motion\nTerminology\nThere are [our important figure of\nmerit for motion tage.

Furthermore, the true\nMIM, stability, and resolution at the tool point (where the fiber\nmeets the device) are much different than at the stage encoder. In order to establish the exact MIM at the tool point, sophisticated experimental setups are needed, normally using\nnon-contact measurements. Although interferometric measurements would be the most precise, it\'s relatively difficult to\nimplement for the typical user. A simpler alternative is to use\nthe power coupling efficiency of two single-mode fibers.\n\nA Simpler Alternative\nAchieving the maximum coupling point during alignment\nis a function of the previously outlined parameters, the alignment algorithm and its ability to search out and seek the maximum point, and other factors including environmental\ncharacteristics. So rather than specifying a motion system in\nterms of MIM, resolution, and other motion related criteria,\nspecifications should be defined in terms of power coupling\nefficiency.\nAll specifications should be easily measurable by both the\ncustomer and the vendor. They should also relate to the performance characteristics of the system in a way that is understood to the user. Lastly, part of the specification should address overall system performance rather than the performance\nof its individual parts. This is particularly important since alignment systems are complex sy tems consisting of motion stages,\nvibration isolation, optical power measurements, and alignment algorithms. The following method for specifying alignment systems addresses these criteria.\nThe experimental setup to verify these specifications is quite\nsimple and con ists of two single-mode fibers. Light passes\nthrough one fiber into the other. The alignment system will\n\nRENI5HAW ~\napply innovation\n\nHigh performance, noncontact angular encoder\n\nRenlshaw Inc. 5277 Trillium Boulevard, Hoffman Estates, IL 60192\nT 8472869953 F 8472869974 E usa@renishaw.com\n\nwww.renlshaw.com\n68\n\nFor Free Info Circle No. 654 or\nEnter No. 654 at www.nasatech.com/rs\n\nalign these two fibers so that there is maximum light coupling.\nThe test conditions are as follows:\nSystem Setup: Two single-mode fibers are separated by a specified distance z in tl1e optical axis. One fiber is on a stationary\nstage. The other is on the alignment system to be tested.\nLoad on the System: The load on the system is W\nTemperature Range: The system will operate within a temperature range K and achieve the above specifications, except for stability (S) specification, which has its own specified range.\nNumber of Measurements: The range and tandard deviation\nof each specification is measured using at least 50 observations.\n\nThe Specifications\nMotion Repeatability is defined by l{, (dB). It is determined by\nachieving alignment, recording the motion coordinates and the\ncoupling power, and then commanding the system to return to\nthe same coordinates and record the power for at least 50 more\nrepetitions. l{, is the standard deviation of these measurements.\nThis measurement is a system level measurement that take into\naccount all tl1e system parameters.\nMaximum Coupling Efficiency i defined by two parameters. The\naverage coupling-loss C (dB). This specification is a measure of\nhow good the coupling is, and is detern1ined by achieving alignment, recording coupling efficiency, then moving all axes (except Z) away from tl1e aligned position, and then aligning again\nand recording power.\nAlignment Repeatability is defined by the coupling loss standard deviation G, (dB) measured as described above. C and\nG, are also system level performance measurements that take\ninto account all the system parameters including the alignment algorithm.\nAlignment Stability is defined by tl1e drift, (dB), in coupling\nloss recorded over a period of t minutes after alignment has been\nachieved, while the temperature fluctuation i limited to a range\nK(s). When determining tills specification, tl1e alignment system\nis kept idle.\nAlignment Time is defined by tl1e average time, Tin seconds, required by tl1e alignment system to reach maximum coupling efficiency from observation of first light.\nFiber-to-fiber alignment does not cover all applications.\nSince single-mode fibers are tandard, it provides a univer al\napparatus to test alignment systems. The user may have other\napplications where tl1ey are aligning lasers to fibers or waveguides to fibers, but those applications are dependent on tl1e\ndevice in que tion and do not provide a universal means for\nystem specification.\nHow will MIM effect tl1e coupling efficiency specifications? If\ntwo fibers are in perfect alignment, movement in the X or Y-axes\nwill result in lower coupling between tl1em. Based on tl1eoretical\nmodels, a 50nm movement in X or Ywill only result in <0.001 dB\nadditional loss. This difference cannot usually be measured but is\ncalculated from a theoretical model. In general, 50nm MIM is\nsufficient for most alignment applications.\nAs standards emerge in the fiber-optic industry for performance of components, similar set of standards are needed for\nthe performance of automation systems, particularly alignment systems. Botl1 the user and the vendor can easily measure\nthe suggested performance criteria. It can also be used as acceptance level te ts or used to compare the performance of different systems.\nThe authors can be contacted by email at Guy Bouvree (Applications\nManager; Motion Systems), gbouvre@newport.com; Frank Vodhanel\n(Product Manager, Fiber Alignment Systems), Fvodhanel\xc2\xaenewpart.com;\nand Sohrab Zarrabian (Sr. Director oj Product Management),\nszarrabian\xc2\xaenewpart.com, or call (949) 862-3400.\nFor more inJormation on Newport Corporation, visit www.newport.com.\nMotion Control Tech Briefs,june 2002\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNEW, Harmonic Drive Gearhead, Zero Backlash\n\n~I-~:\n\n~~. ._\n_\xe2\x80\xa2 . .\n\nI\n\n,\n\nThe CSF-2UH series high torque gearheads use HD Systems\' patented\n\'S\' tooth that delivers more than twice the torque, twice the life, and\ntwice the torsional stiffness when compared to conventional Harmonic\nDrive Gearing.

Currently, it is used to support the development of imulation and operation\ntools for the Mar Exploration Rover\n(MER) in the Mars \'03 mission.\nOne of the most important propertie\nof the algorithm is the robu t computational result, which yields a fast prediction of the rover\'s position and orientation in an uncertain environment. The\nROAMS algorithm u\'eats the underlying\nmathematical model as an inverse-kin mati problem , and carries out the 0lution using the computational techniques for con trained optimization. In\nthis framework, the objective function\ncompri e three condition: (1) rover\'s\ninternal differen tial mechanisms, (2)\nwheel-terrain contact, and (3) rover\'\ndriving motion . The re ultant nonlinear\nequations can be derived, and their solution can be computed by a traigh tforward application of numerical method . However, the tandard approache\nto this nonlinear y tern of equation\nuffer from the in tability and inefficiency in the numerical solution due to\nthe rough terrain profile, which is often\nmodeled as a piecewi e mooth digital\nelevation map (DEM) . Moreover, the\nmodeling of the phy ical limits of the\nlinkage (e.g., the bumper- top) can be\nproblematic to the olution, a well as\nthe case that all wheels may not be in\ncontact with the ground at all time . All\ntile e modeling and numerical difficultie are re olved in tile novel algorithm\nthat achieve the real-time imulation of\nthe rover traver al on a rocky terrain.\nIn thi algorithm, we implemented a\newton-type iterative method that handles the non-smooth wheel-terrain contact equations u ing global earching\nand relaxation techniques. The olution\nalso takes account for the bump-stopper\ndevices, which have b en modeled as\nthe joint limits at tile corresponding\nlinkages, and maintains a fast convergent rate. Regular ewton-type iteration requires the moothness of tile\nequations to ensure a fast convergence.\nThi prerequisite of a robust convergence i violated since the roughne of\nthe terrain has been embedded in the\ncontact equations. When the rocker or\nbogey linkage reach their limi ts, an\nabruption of the iteration can induce\nMotion Control Tech Briefs,June 2002\n\nnonlinear equations. However, the rate of convergence\ncan be tremendou ly decreased when a non-smooth\nterrain profile appears.

CroW1ling of\nthe races is expected to reduce scuffing\nof the cylindrical rollers. Crowning of\nthe race is expected to be especially beneficial in bearing made of polymers (intead of metals) to reduce weight.\nThe crossed-roller bearing de ign is\nthe roller equivalent of the x-type ball\nbearing design. In a cro ed-roller bearing, the race are conical surface at angles of 45\xc2\xb0 to the axis of rotation. The advantage and disadvantages of the ball\nand cro sed-roller designs are complementary: In compari on with ball bearing, roller bearing can with tand\ngreater load. On the other hand, roller\nbearings are more usceptible to cuffing,\nwhich is caused by a kinematic mismatch\nbetween tangential roller speed at the\ninner and outer diameters of the race.\nIn a cros ed-roller bearing with\ncrowned races ( ee figure), the contact\narea, and thus the amount of scuffing,\nwould be reduced (relative to that of con-\n\nical races) to a value near that of ball\nbearing. T he crown radius is a free design parameter that can be chosen, along\nwith other parameters, in con ideration\nof the bearing material(s) and the loads\nthat must be borne in a given application.\nOne might ask why it would be preferable to crown the races instead of crowning the roller. The reason i a practical\none: Unlike in the case of steel bearing\nballs, it is difficult to fabricate polymeric\nbearing ball or polymeric crowned\nrollers with sufficient precision to ensure\nsharing ofloads as needed for long bearing life. On the other hand, cylindrical\ncrowned rollers of ufficient preci ion\ncan be fabricated easil by centerless\ngrinding in conventional machines.\nThis work was done by Donald Bickler of\nCaltecl~ for NASA\'s J et Propulsion Laboratory.
