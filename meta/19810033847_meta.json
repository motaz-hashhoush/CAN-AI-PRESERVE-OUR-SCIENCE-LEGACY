The processing flow for vertically handled spacecraft, which are inserted into the Shuttle orbiter cargo bay while the orbiter is in the vertical position and often are attached to a separate solid booster stage, includes assembly into unified payloads in the Vertical Processing Facility, followed by Cargo Integration Test Equipment tests to ensure cargo bay compatibility, and transportation to the launch pad. Horizontally handled spacecraft such as Spacelab, which are inserted into the Orbiter cargo bay while it is in the Orbiter Processing Facility in the horizontal position, are assembled and checked out within the Operations and Checkout Building, where the CITE tests are performed and the Spacelab will be disassembled, and then transported to the Orbiter Processing Facility. It is pointed out that during the Space Shuttle era, when the number of spacecraft to be processed simultaneously at Kennedy will double or triple, all spacecraft processing facilities will be required to handle the workload.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Japan", "submissionId": 19810033847, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Astronautical Federation"}}, "meetingId": "9a65a279048b4dd9a73cf1819fef1ce0", "id": "46a9754dc8d341a9957f7e1e019cd4c3"}], "name": "International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Tokyo", "id": "9a65a279048b4dd9a73cf1819fef1ce0"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810033847, "id": "b87fd6657e254433ac0689adf9a12c4a", "publicationDate": "1980-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
