Among its desirable properties the algorithm includes a control of encoding errors independently of the image statistics. This block transform encoder, because of its adaptive nature gives rise to nonstationary errors and end of block effects. Two methods are proposed to reduce these effects and thus improve the subjective quality of reconstructed images. The performance of the algorithm is image  dependent and several illustrative examples are given.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19730038590, "endDate": "1972-10-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Telemetering Conference", "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": "e1680e9a1f5c422c86e8d2f4528a5dde", "startDate": "1972-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730038590, "id": "5e7c9d6d5f4a42fc8120e580250c9b3c", "publicationDate": "1972-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
