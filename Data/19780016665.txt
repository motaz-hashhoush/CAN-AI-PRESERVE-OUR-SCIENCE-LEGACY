Along the\ninner rim of the rotor, there is a layer of magnetically\nsoft iron that forms homopolar, salient pole pairs. An\nironless armature winding mounted on the stator extends into an air gap formed between the pole pairs. To\nbring the rotor up to speed, alternating current is supplied to the armature winding using electronic commutation. The armature current interacts with flux in the\nair gap to create a force acting to rotate the rotor. During coast down, current may be tapped from the rotor\nusing commutation diodes. The rotor and stator are\nmaintained in axial alignment to each other by magnetic\nflux produced by a permanent magnet in the stator. An\nelectromagnet incorporated in the stator modulates\npermanent magnet flux to compensate for any eccentricity between the stator and the rotor that may develop during rotation.\n\nFOREIGN PATENT DOCUMENTS\n2,360,412\n\n6/1975\n\nGermany\n\n...............................\n\n308/10\n\n14 Claims, 5 Drawing Figures\n\n1\n9\n\n\xe2\x80\x9858a\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nMarch 7, 1978\n\n4,077,678\n\nSheet 1 of 2\n\n441\n9\n\nf1g.4\n\n\xe2\x80\x9858a\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nMarch 7, 1978\n\n4,077,678\n\nSheet 2 of 2\n\nFIG.3\n\nI\n38b\n\np\n57\n\nI [-FS6\nSPEED\nCONTROL\n\n.\n\nCOM M\nDIODES\n\nFROM SOURCE\n\nTO LOAD\n\n\xe2\x80\x9855\n\nFIG2\n\n1\n\n4,077,678\n\nENERGY STORAGE APPARATUS\nORIGIN OF THE INVENTION\nThe invention described herein was made by employ- 5\nees of the United States Government and it may be\nmanufactured and used by and for the United States\nGovernment for Governmental purposes without the\npayment of any royalties thereon or therefore.\n10\n\nFIELD O F THE INVENTION\nThis invention relates generally to mechanical energy\nstorage devices, and more particularly to a highly efficient mechanical storage device comprising a magnetically levitated, spokeless, flywheel rotor having homo- 15\npolar salient poles and a stationary, ironless, electronically commutated armature.\n\nBACKGROUND O F THE INVENTION\nA basic problem presently facing utility companies is 20\nvariation in demand for power. Electric utilities typically incorporate (1) base load generators, (2) intermediate load generators, and (3) peak load generators to\naccomodate daily load demands. Base load generators,\nwhich operate 100% of the time at constant throttle, are 25\npowered by relatively less expensive fossil fuel or by\nnuclear generators. About 70% of the system power\noutput is generated by the base load generators operating at lowest delivered cost. The intermediate load\ngenerators, which are typically gas turbines or diesel 30\nengines, are powered by less efficient fossil-fueled steam\ngenerators and gas turbines. The intermediate load generators are normally run only during the day, and furnish about 25% of the power at significantly higher\ncosts. The remaining power is derived from peak load 35\ngenerators requiring costly and scarce fuels. Peak load\ngenerators are operated only on demand and serve the\nimmediate load peaks of the day.\nIn the past, electric utilities have attempted to reduce\nthe high cost of peak power generation through 40\npumped hydroelectric storage. Typically, water is\npumped uphill during off-peak hours and stored in a\nreservoir for later peak hour use. This method is practical only for large scale use and is limited to locations\nwhere geography permits construction of large reser- 45\nvoirs. In another approach, air is compressed during\noff-peak hours, and the potential energy stored in the\ncompressed air is later released for use during peak\nhours. This has also been shown to be of limited practicality.\n50\nIt has been proposed to store energy during low demand periods by using electric power to rotate a massive flywheel, and tapping energy from the flywheel\nduring high demand periods. A flywheel rotor in conjunction with an electric motodgenerator unit is pro- 55\nvided, wherein by operating the unit as a motor, the\nflywheel rotor is brought up to operating speed and\nallowed to coast. Energy is extracted from the flywheel\nrotor during coasting by operating the motor/generator\nunit as a generator.\n60\nRotating flywheel systems have not been entirely\nsuccessful due to low operating efficiency caused by,\namong other factors, losses from eddy currents, friction,\nwindage and relatively poor energy storage per unit\nweight of the flywheel. In addition, there is a substantial 65\nhazard of catastrophic failure of the rotor.\nIn U.S. Pat. No. 3,158,750 to Roes, a mechanical\nenergy storage device includes a rotor rotatably sup-\n\n2\n\nported on a frame. A series of magnets are spaced apart\nfrom each other along the outer rim of the rotor. A\nsynchronous armature winding mounted on the frame is\ndisposed so as to intersect the magnetic field established\nby the rotor magnets and to cause torque to be applied\nto the, rotor when alternating current is passed through\nthe armature winding. The rotor is supported by spokes\nextending to a shaft that in turn is journaled to a set of\nconventional magnetic bearings.\nAlthough generally somewhat satisfactory for limited\nuse in an outer space environment, the efficiency of the\nRoes system is insufficient for storage of energy of the\nmagnitudes required by electric utilities. The magnets\ncontained on the rotor in Roes create magnetic fields\nthat tend to induce eddy currents in the stationary,\nmetallic frame members in proximity to the rotor. These\neddy currents result in eddy current losses that substantially diminish storage efficiency. The magnets along\nthe rim of the rotor, being discrete elements, also create\nbalancing problems and induce additional stresses on\nthe rotor thereby increasing the chances of failure. The\nmagnets themselves are difficult to manufacture because they must be accurately ground to size and imbedded into the rotor so as to create minimum imbalance\nand stress concentrations.\nAccordingly, an object of the present invention is to\nprovide a new and improved mechanical energy storage\ndevice.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide\na new and improved energy storage system incorporating a flywheel rotor.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide\na flywheel energy storage device that is highly efficient\nand less prone to structural failure.\nYet another object of the present invention is to provide a motor-driven, flywheel-type energy storage device including a continuous, spokeless, flywheel rotor\nhaving no discrete rotor elements.\nStill another object of the present invention is to\nprovide a motor-driven, flywheel-type energy storage\ndevice, wherein eddy current losses are minimized.\nStill another object of the present invention is to\nprovide a motor-driven, flywheel-type energy storage\ndevice, wherein a flywheel rotor is devoid of permanent\nmagnets so as to reduce eddy current losses by interaction of a moving magnetic field with stationary elements.\nYet another object of the present invention is to provide a motor-driven, flywheel-type energy storage device, including a flywheel rotor having high specific\nstrength per unit weight density.\nStill another object of the present invention is to\nprovide a new and improved motor-driven, flywheeltype energy storage device, wherein a flywheel rotor is\nmagnetically levitated to eliminate mechanical drag\nbetween the rotor and stationary elements.\nSUMMARY O F THE INVENTION\nIn accordance with the present invention, a high\nefficiency, flywheel-type energy storage device comprises an electronically commutated D.C. motor/generator unit having a massive flywheel rotor magnetically\nsuspended around a ring-shaped stator.
