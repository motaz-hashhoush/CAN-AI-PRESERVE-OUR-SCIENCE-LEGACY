The limiting factor in reducing separation distances and improving airport capacity is the wake vortex hazard. The ability to accurately model wake vortices and predict the outcome of a vortex encounter is critical in developing a system to safely improve airport capacity. This is the focus of the wake vortex research being done at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC). This paper will concentrate on two topics. The first topic is the control system developed for the Boeing 737 freeflight model in support of vortex encounter tests to be conducted in the 30- by 60- foot tunnel at NASA Langley Research Center later this year. The second topic discussed is the limited degree of freedom (DOF) trajectory generation study that is being conducted to determine the relative severity of a multitude of paths through a wake vortex.", "title": "Wake Vortex Encounter Research", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T18:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19970003129, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wilson, Jeffrey M."}, "organization": {"name": "Kansas Univ.", "location": "Lawrence, KS United States"}}, "id": "af9548dc2c89408ab615f8aca5bf9c27"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19970003129, "publications": [{"volume": "Part 2", "submissionId": 19970003129, "id": "fbd484b049354a6a9b8d8b8e4230566e", "publicationName": "Langley Aerospace Research Summer Scholars", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19970003089, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Langley Aerospace Research Summer Scholars", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970003129.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970003129/downloads/19970003129.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970003129/downloads/19970003129.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970003129/downloads/19970003129.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
