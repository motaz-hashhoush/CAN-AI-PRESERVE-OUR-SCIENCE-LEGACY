The hardware was to the same specification and was to be completely interchangeable with the Command Decoder hardware designed\nand produced under a then existing contract, NAS9-13565.\n\n;I\n\nThe hardware was designed as a Shuttle compatible data acquisition/\ncommand decoder remote terminal. The equipment was to be used in\nthe laboratory to evaluate techniques for implementing operational instrumentation, data processing and ground checkout operations,\nx\n\nProcurement\nProcurement of most of the necessary parts and materials started immediately after contract award. Materials for some of the Command\nDecoder Unit (CDU) modules were not ordered immediately due to design\nchanges as a result of system testing on the first contract (NAS-9-13565),\nBy July 15, 1974, sufficient parts and materials had been received to begin releasing assemblies to production, By September 1974, all\nmaterials had been received to complete the first two CDU's. Additional\nparts were ordered to reflect changes as a result of additional evaluation\nof the first CDU's on the initial contract.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing of individual CDU circuit cards, power supplies and the\nmain housings were scheduled to follow completion of similar assemblies\ncn the initial NASA contract, Some assemblies were completed during late\n\n-1-\n\nd\n\n1\n\nf\n\nSeptember 1974, but most manufacturing effort started during October 1974.\nManufacturing continued in a routine manner until completed in August 1975.\nTesting\nA test plan, production test procedures, production test fixtures and a\nfinal system acceptance test procedure were prepared and used to test all\nhardware on NASA Contract NAS9-13565. The same testing continued on\nthis contract.\nThe first individual card tests started in late January 1975. The first complete CDU was tested during July 1975. All module tests were completed\nduring August 1975. The last CDU was tested in December 1975.\nA final test report was prepared and submitted for each individual CDU\nthat was shipped, by serial number.\nDocumentation\nMonthly progress reports, etc. as required by the contract were submitted\nin a timely manner.\nRecommendations\nThe CDU is a redundant modular remote terrain=.1 which may be configured\nto meet a wide variety of specific input/output iuquirements. It interfaces\nwith the data bus via a Data Bus Coupler which is compatible with Shuttle\nhardware. The unit should allow NASA to evaluate variou ,e system combinations and develop software for future applications. T.: is felt that the\npresent unit is capable of meeting all these requirements without modification.\nThe unit should be re-packaged if it becomes necessary to subject it to a\nfull flight environment.\n\n14\n\na\n\n"
