Reliability is roughly the probability that a system will perform according to specifications for a given amount of time. The reliability of a system depends on the structure of its components. Systems theory and control theory deal with the response characteristics of a system, which depend on the system dynamics. The concepts necessary to unify the structural and the dynamic properties of a system are defined. The result is a definition of what constitutes a reliable systems, from the viewpoint of systems theory, and a methodology which can be used to determine if a given design allows a reliable control system design.", "title": "On reliable control system designs", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T03:43:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870035526, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Birdwell, J.
