b"Transportation\n\nhen the Boeing 777 first took wing, it carried\nwith it basic and applied research, technology,\nand aerodynamic knowledge honed at several\nNASA field centers.\nThe precedent-setting 777 was built to handle\nmedium- to long-range passenger flights and is the\nlargest twin-engine jet to be manufactured today. First\npassenger-carrying flights began in May 1995. According to Boeing Company estimates, the 777 fleet has\ncaptured three-quarters of new orders for airplanes in its\nclass since the program was launched.\nIn May 1996, the first Boeing 777 stopped by\nLangley Research Center as a salute to NASA's involvement in its creation. Several Langley innovations were\ninstrumental in the development of the aircraft, such as:\nfundamental mathematical procedures for\ncomputer-generated airflow images\nwhich allowed advanced computerbased aerodynamic analysis;\nwind tunnel tests, confirming\nthe structural integrity of 777 wingairframe integration in Langley's\nTransonic AerodynamicsTunnel.\nUse of the facility was reimbursed to\nNASA by Boeing;\nknowledge of how to reduce engine\nand other noise for passengers and\nterminal area residents;\nradial tires that are used on the aircraft\nunderwent strength and durability\ntesting at Langley's Aircraft Landing\nDynamics Facility; and\nincreased use of lightweight aerospace\ncomposite structures for increased fuel\nefficiency and range. The 777's floor\nbeams, flaps and tail make use of lightweight\ncomposites.\nAt Marshall Space Flight Center, results from tests\naimed at improving the performance of NASA's Space\nShuttle engines led to improvements in the Boeing 777's\nnew, more efficient jet engines. Working with Pratt &\nWhitney, the U.S. aircraft and rocket engine provider,\nNASA engineers conducted evaluations of wake patterns\nflowing through the plane's turbine engine airfoils. Data\ntaken proved useful in obtaining better turbine efficiency, as well as realizing substantial fuel savings.\nBoeing 777 inlet, hinge and strut blankets were\nquilted with either stainless steel or ceramic thread.\nThese blankets protected areas of the plane from high\ntemperatures and fire. Fostered by Ames Research\nCenter, the Boeing 777 blankets have a lineage to\nAdvanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI)\nused on certain areas of the Space Shuttle.\n\nSeveral other areas benefitted from NASA and\nBoeing collaboration. Langley had contracted with\nBoeing, for example, to design and validate a digital\nflight control system for fly-by-wire and fly-by-light/\npower-by-wire applications. In developing the digital\nfly-by-wire system, researchers utilized the Apollo\nguidance, navigation and control hardware as the\nprimary digital system. Fly-by-wire systems for control\nof wing and tail surfaces replace bulkier and heavier\npulley and cable systems on the 777.\nThe Boeing 777's modern glass cockpit is a system\nthat uses computer technology to integrate information\nand display it on monitors in easy-to-use format.\nResearch was undertaken on the challenge of maintaining a pilot's situational awareness during flight operations. The evolution of the highly automated glass\n\nBuilsng the Boeing 777brought about the use of NASA\ninnovations,fiom lightweight composite materrerr& the m o k\nto\ng h s cockpit and aircrafi controlsystems.\n\ncockpit, particularly in commercial aircraft, has roots at\nLangley Research Center.\nTaken as a whole, NASA contributions in fundamental research and technologies proved meaningful to\n777 development. Together, industry and government\nskills and abilities melded, jointly contributing to the\nairplane's operating efficiency, passenger service,\nenvironmental compatibility and safety.\n\n"
