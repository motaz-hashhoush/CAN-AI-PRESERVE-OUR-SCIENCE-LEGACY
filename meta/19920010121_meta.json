The discussion relates to the University of Houston-Clear Lake (UHCL) Research Institute for Computing and Information Systems (RICIS) Program to bring about this type of triad in the Clear Lake area. It is concluded that the interfaces among these groups must remain independent to maintain a healthy counterbalance to their respective entities. However, each entity can and must understand the entire mechanism to exploit each interface to the fullest.
