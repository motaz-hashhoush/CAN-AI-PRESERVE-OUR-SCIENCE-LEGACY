It is argued that the technology of beamed energy propulsion systems may significantly improve the prospects for near-term colonization of outer space. It is tentatively concluded that, for space industrialization purposes, the most attractive near-term beamed energy propulsion systems are based on microwave technology. This conclusion is reached based on consideration of the common features that exist between beamed microwave propulsion and the Solar Power Satellite (SPS) concept. Laser power beaming also continues to be an attractive option for spacecraft propulsion due to the reduced diffraction-induced beam spread afforded by laser radiation wavelengths. The conceptual status and development potential of a variety of beamed energy propulsion concepts are presented. Several alternative space transportation system concepts based on beamed energy propulsion are described.", "title": "Beamed energy for space craft propulsion - Conceptual status and development potential", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T16:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880056748, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sercel, Joel C."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "c1baeb4b32e248628f81669a02c509c1"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880056748, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Frisbee, Robert H."}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology", "location": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, United States"}}, "id": "3d3c756a83344085954d1740d643050a"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19880056748, "endDate": "1987-05-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIAA and Space Studies Institute"}}, "meetingId": "a04ef9226f1a45519884f60b1bf7dbf6", "id": "08b89a62925b49e1ba9f78592054ba15"}], "name": "Space manufacturing 6 - Nonterrestrial resources, biosciences, and space engineering", "location": "Princeton, NJ", "id": "a04ef9226f1a45519884f60b1bf7dbf6", "startDate": "1987-05-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19880056748, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880056748, "id": "6f5dffc5665c489089c2d9998253bd1e", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
