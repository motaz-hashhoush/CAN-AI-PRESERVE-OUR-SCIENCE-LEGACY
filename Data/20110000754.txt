b'Solid-State Recorders Enhance Scientific Data Collection\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nO\n\nn May 20, 1996, astronauts aboard the Space\nShuttle Endeavor watched as a unique structure\nunfolded in space like a complex trick of origami. From the free-flying Spartan satellite the STS-77\ncrew had released from the shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s cargo hold, a massive\ncircular antenna inflated into shape. About the size of a\ntennis court, the Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE)\nwas the first space structure of its kind, laying the foundation for future work on inflatable satellites, telescopes,\nand even astronaut dwellings.\nAfter the IAE\xe2\x80\x99s deployment, the structure was jettisoned and the Spartan satellite was recaptured by the\nshuttle. Key to the experiment\xe2\x80\x99s success was a new device\nonboard the satellite that recorded and stored the critical\ntest data.\n\nPartnership\nPrior to the IAE, most NASA satellites and missions\nlogged data using magnetic tape recorders. In terms of\ndata gathering and storage, these missions were limited to\nhow much these devices could record and how fast. The\nrecorders\xe2\x80\x99 mechanical systems also made them vulnerable\nto failure; backup recorders took up valuable onboard real\nestate and added to cost and launch weight.\nIn 1983, National Reconnaissance Office pioneer Ray\nAnderson and son Scott founded SEAKR Engineering\nInc., based in Centennial, Colorado. Ray Anderson had\nrecognized that tape recorders represented a life-limiting\nspacecraft component, and SEAKR set about developing a\nreplacement device that would lower cost while increasing\nreliability and capacity. The company turned to solidstate technology for a solution.\nSolid-state, or flash memory, devices are crafted\nentirely from solid materials in which the only moving\nparts are electrons. A solid-state recorder (SSR) stores\ninformation in binary code (0s and 1s) in tiny transistors;\ntransistors conducting current have a value of 1, while\n128\t Computer Technology \t\n\nThe Inflatable Antenna Experiment, seen here fully deployed from its Spartan satellite, logged its data on an SBIR-derived solid-state\nrecorder (SSR) developed by SEAKR Engineering Inc.\n\nthose that are not have a value of 0. Since there are no\nmoving parts that could fail, and the information in the\nrecorder can only be altered by voltage changes in the\ntransistors, solid-state technology offers a more reliable,\ndurable, and compact method of data storage. (Think of\nreplacing a cassette player with an iPod nano.)\nSEAKR first demonstrated its space-ready, SSR\ntechnology on a U.S. Department of Defense satellite\nbefore launching a device on the NASA-funded Orbital\nSciences SeaStar satellite (now known as OrbView-2),\nwhich carried the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor\n(SeaWiFS) for imaging of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s oceans. Under\nSmall Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts\nwith Goddard Space Flight Center, the company then\n\nbuilt the SSR that replaced the original tape recorder on\nthe Spartan satellite and gathered the test data for the\nIAE mission. SEAKR\xe2\x80\x99s NASA work helped the company\nadvance its SSR technology.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemonstrating that you have a sound design that\nfunctions in space is a difficult hurdle to get over,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nScott Anderson, SEAKR\xe2\x80\x99s president. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce we got over\nthat hurdle, the fact that we were a small company with\nextremely low cost structures put us in a position to win\nopportunities as programs and customers switched from\ntape recorders to solid state.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSEAKR\xe2\x80\x99s SSRs opened up new capabilities for space\nmissions that were previously hampered by tape recorder\nlimitations.\nSpinoff 2010\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly, that bottleneck disappeared. Multiple,\ndifferent instruments could record at the same time.\nThey could run at considerably higher data rates,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nAnderson. \xe2\x80\x9cThe capacities of these solid-state systems\nconsiderably outperformed the tape recorders. They\nbecame mission-enabling technologies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nProduct Outcome\nToday, SEAKR is the world leader in solid-state\nrecorder technology for spacecraft. The company has\ndelivered more than 100 systems, more than 85 of which\nhave launched onboard NASA, military, and commercial\nspacecraft, and none of which have experienced on-orbit\nfailure. The company has also built upon its expertise\nwith solid-state electronics to branch out into other critical flight technologies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you think about what\xe2\x80\x99s in a solid-state recorder\xe2\x80\x94\na microprocessor, a lot of memory, software, packaging\ntechnologies\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all the same technologies that\xe2\x80\x99s in\na flight computer,\xe2\x80\x9d Anderson says. \xe2\x80\x9cBuilding high performance computers for spacecraft is now our largest\ngrowing market segment.\xe2\x80\x9d The company also offers bulk\nmemory module products it says arose from technology\ndeveloped for NASA programs like the Small Spacecraft\nTechnology Initiative, the Mars Global Surveyor, and\nMars Polar Lander.\nSEAKR hardware has flown on many NASA missions, from satellites and planetary probes to the space\nshuttles and the Spitzer and Kepler space telescopes. The\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s SSRs have recorded data for the Mars Global\nSurveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and SEAKR\ndeveloped the High Rate Communication Outage\nRecorder (HCOR) for the International Space Station.\nThe HCOR allows separate nodes within the station to\nroute their science and communication data to a single,\nlarge memory buffer.\nOutside of NASA, SEAKR has used its solid-state technology to build more than 1,100 memory boards for the\nU.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster cargo aircraft. SEAKR\nSpinoff 2010\t\n\nSSRs are also part of the GeoEye-1 and WorldView-1\nimaging satellites, which provide much of the highresolution imagery for online mapping services.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you see a picture on Google Earth, there\xe2\x80\x99s\na good probability that the image came through one of\nour recorders,\xe2\x80\x9d says Anderson.\nSEAKR\xe2\x80\x99s technological accomplishments continue to\npush the limits of solid-state space electronics. Through\nthe Internet Routing in Space project, the company collaborated with Cisco Systems and the Department of\nDefense and built a space-hardened Internet router that\nallows Web access and communications to occur directly\nthrough satellites rather than double-hopping to and from\n\nstations on Earth, a capability\nthat may one day allow quick\n\xe2\x80\x9cNASA is\nhelping us fund a and highly reliable communications for soldiers in the\ntechnology that is field.\ngoing to push the\nSEAKR is also working\non another SBIR partnerperformance of\nship with Goddard to build a\nthese systems in\nhigh-performance flash-based\nthe future.\xe2\x80\x9d\nmemory module based on\nthe VPX electronics standard, which allows for greater power and ruggedness.\nThe results, Anderson says, will continue to advance the\ntechnology that demonstrated its usefulness so readily on\nthe Spartan satellite nearly 15 years ago.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is going to be a great collaboration,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nAnderson. \xe2\x80\x9cNASA is helping us fund a technology that\nis going to push the performance of these systems in\nthe future.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x9d\x96\niPod nano\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Apple Inc.\nGoogle Earth\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of Google Inc.\n\n\t\n\nSEAKR\xe2\x80\x99s SSRs have become mission-enabling technologies,\nplaying a vital role in many NASA missions and onboard multiple\ncommercial satellites.\n\nComputer Technology \t 129\n\n'
