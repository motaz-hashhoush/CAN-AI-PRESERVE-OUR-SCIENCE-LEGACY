That makes Laser Tech Briefs\nunique among magazines that deal with\nphoronics technology.\nSix NASA labs are represented in these\npages: Lewis Research Center, Marshall\nSpace Flight Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, Langley Research Center, and Goddard Space Flight\nCenter. They are joined by nine non-NASA\nlabs from the Departments of Defense, Energy, and Interior: Air Force Rome Laboratory,\nBrookhaven National Laboratory, Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory, David Sarnoff Research Laboratory, Army Ft. Monmouth Laboratory, the Bureau of Mines\'\nPittsburgh Research Center, the University\nof New Mexico\'s Center for High Technology Materials, Sandia National Laboratories,\nand Air Force Phillips Laboratory.\nAll have active and productive programs in widely diverse areas of photonics\ntechnology. But this is just the beginning.\nWe are currently working with numerous\nother federal laboratories that are eager to\ncontribute to future issues of Laser Tech\nBrief. Their presence will cement our standing as the premier vehicle for bringing the\nwealth of innovation in the federal laboratories to the attention of designers and engineers in industry.\nLooking beyond the briefs, each issue\nwill profile the technology transfer program\nof a laboratory engaged in photonics\nresearch. This month Laser Tech Brief features not a lab as such, but rather the\nAlliance for Photonic Technology, a cooperative association linking the technology\ntransfer activities of four New Mexico laboratories. See the story "Alliance for Photonic\nTechnology: Putting Industry Needs First,"\nelsewhere in this issue.\nIn future issues the magazine will break\nmore new ground: Laser Tech Brief will take\nreaders inside industrial and university laboratories conducting important photonics\nresearch with federal support, with special\nattention to those seeking industrial partners. Another editorial series will trace the\npaths taken by manufacturers in successfully\nconverting innovative technology into a\nlaser, optical, or optoelectronic product.\nLaser Tech Brief\' editorial vision goes\nfrom alpha to omega, from raw idea to finished\narticle. We invite you to accompany us each\nstep of the way.\n\nWINTER 1994\n\n5\n\nQr\n\nUnless\n\xe2\x80\xa2 the laser diode destined for your\nproduct application is completely\nprotected against the forces of\nelectro-static discharge, temperature\nand handling abuse. That\'s because\na raw laser diode is a fragile and\nhighly volatile device with extreme\nthreshold behavior that will quickly\n"blow up" under unstable environmental conditions. The typical laser\ndiode is capable of turning on in "one\nmillionth" of a second. . . and one very\nshort "mistake" usually results in total\ndestruction, rendering the laser diode\nuseless. Applied Laser Systems\n(ALS) has solved this problem and\nmakes the laser diode usable in the\nreal world.\nSo, while it may seem practical to\nengineer your laser product "from the\nground up," it makes far more sense to\nbypass the frustrating process of\ntrying to stabilize the laser diode by\nsimply "plugging in" our patented\n\nVLMTM product directly into your appli cation. Our modular system is so\nuser friendly, all you have to do is add\na power supply.\nSimply put, the ALS Visible\nLaser Module, or VLM m product is\nthe most advanced laser module\nsystem on the market today. Our\nminiature design incorporates the\nlaser diode, drive circuits, and\nsophisticated optics into one tiny,\nself-contained, shock resistant\npackage, allowing us to maximize\npower efficiency while protecting the\ninternal circuitry from electro-static\ndischarge, spiking overload and\nreverse polarity. In short, the VLMTU\nproduct makes the fragile laser diode\nvirtually indestructible.\nAnd with a field failure rate of\nless than 1 percent, Applied Laser\nSystems supports its products with\na full two year warranty, setting\nthe industry standard. In addition,\na small green LED indicator is\nmounted on the rear of each\nmodule to indicate when the laser\nis operating... a safety factor that\nALS alone provides.\n\nThe versatile VLMrM product\ncomes ready-to-use in a variety of\nbeam configurations and wavelengths, in both the visible and infrared bands. Modules can easily be\nintegrated into a wide variety of\napplications that require precision\nand accuracy, such as alignment\nand positioning, counting and timing,\nsignal transmission, testing and\nmeasurement, and illumination...\nright out of the box.\nWhy waste critical R&D funds on\ncostly experimentation? At ALS we\'ve\nalready figured it out!\n\nLS\n\nAPPLIED LASER SYSTEMS\n2160 N.W.

The conditions that make it an\nexemplar of technology transfer are\nunique: four laboratories with significant R&D programs in photonics,\nlinked by physical proximity\xe2\x80\x94each is\nwithin a few hours\' drive of Albuquerque\xe2\x80\x94and nurtured in its aims by the\nstate\'s Economic Development Department. Yet its work can serve as a roadmap for technology reinvestment planners everywhere.\nIt was an initiative by New Mexico\'s two senators, Pete Domenici and\nJeff Bingaman, that led to the Alliance\'s\ncreation. While crafting the National\nCompetitiveness Technology Transfer\nAct of 1989, the two wanted to insure\nthat the state\'s Department of Energy\nlaboratories had the same Cooperative\nResearch and Development Agreement\n(CRADA) authority that civil service\nlaboratories had been exercising since\nLASER TECH BRIEFS\t\n\n1986. But the Alliance\'s mission quickly\nexpanded beyond this initial impulse: in\nthe terse formulation of William P.\nLatham of Phillips Lab, an early Alliance\ninterim director, "International competitiveness of US industry is the primary\ngoal of APT."\nToday APT\'s formal mission statement embraces not only US competitiveness in photonics, but the following\nadditional aims: to accelerate technology\ntransfer to US industry, to contribute to\nNew Mexico\'s economic development,\nto improve communications and technical interactions among its R&D participants, and to develop a core of support\nfor its participants outside their traditional sources.\nAPT\'s structure is designed to facilitate these goals. Currently each of the\nR&D participants assigns a representative to an advisory board that oversees\nthe activity of APT\'s director and staff.\nThe director is assisted by four associate\ndirectors, each again representing one\nconstituent, and by a research and development committee and four current\nworking groups. An industrial advisory\nboard is in the process of being formed.\nIn its fledgling stage, led by its first\ninterim director, Larry Anderson, APT\nreached out to US industry by organizing technical meeting exhibits, visiting\n16\t\n\nprospective industrial partners, hosting\nAPT visits for companies, including laboratory visits, and answering phone inquiries. That its efforts paid off is apparent from the fact that, in 1992 alone, its\ninitiatives yielded 13 CRADAs valued at\n$53 million, and a list issued that year offered more than 100 patents available for\nlicensing from the R&D participants.\nAPT activities are sure to get a lift\nfrom the appointment early last year\nof the organization\'s first permanent\ndirector. Dr. Concerto Giuliano, widely\nknown in the photonics industry by his\nnickname "Connie," brings to the position a distinguished professional lifetime\nof experience in photonics, for many\nyears with Hughes Aircraft Research\nLaboratories and most recently with\nTextron in Maui, Hawaii.\nGiuliano summarizes the work of\nAPT in three steps: identify the needs in\nthe private sector, identify the capabilities among the R&D partners, and\nmatch them. To deliver this message\nduring the year just past, APT participated in six exhibits, and in addition\nattended seven technical conferences\nand five technology transfer/policy conferences. Giuliano also made a number\nof personal and professional contacts\nand industrial laboratory site visits,\nresulting, he says, in the growth of\nWINTER 1994\n\nAPI\'s custoricr COfltdCt\ndatabase by 70% to 1250.\nAn APT Technical Interchange Conference in\nPhotonics planned for the\ncoming spring aims to\nenhance communication\namong the R&D partners,\naccording to Giuliano.\nThough the technical presentations will be limited\nto APT\'s R&D partners.\nGiuliano intends to invite\nindustrial representatives\ninterested in finding a fit of\nAPT capabilities to theii\nrequirements.\nAs an example of thL\nrole of the working groups,\nwhich have embraced such\nareas as flat-panel displays\nand medical applications of\nlasers, the year-old Optical\nSensors and Photonic\nDevices Working Group\n(OSWG) numbers 1\nmembers from the four\nlabs. With about 75 responses from a questionnaire concerning photonic sensors and\ndevices available for technology transfer\nby APT participants, OSWG put\ntogether an Optical Sensors and\nPhotonic Devices Database. It exists on\nFilemaker Pro for Macintosh and can be\nexported to many other formats as well.\nA related APT Optical Sensors and\nPhotonic Devices Directory was scheduled for printing last month.\nSEARCHING FOR SYNERGIES\n\nThe APT approach to technology\ntransfer, according to the director, differs in significant ways from the commonplace. It emphasizes competitivephase joint development with industry,\nfocusing on customer goals. Wherever\npossible development projects are driven\nby market, product, and application\nneeds. And finally, APT gives special\nattention to the synergies between its\nseveral constituent members.\nThough each of APT\'s participants\nhas capabilities stretching across the\nphotonic technologies, one of the\nadvantages offered by APT is its awareness of the synergy of such capabilities\nwhen they are pooled. The Center for\nLASER TECH BRIEFS\t\n\nAt the US Air Force Phillips Laboratory\'s\nStarfire Optical Range, a .copper vapor\nimaging laser beams upward from the 1.5meter-aperture telescope, which, in conjunction with a newly operational 3.5meter-aperture unit, probes the atmosphere and uses a deformable mirror to correct aberrations in real time.\n\nHigh Technology Materials has particular strength in materials growth, Sandia\nin device processing and modeling,\nPhillips in diagnostics, and Los Alamos\nin innovative applications. But when\nconsidered in combination, the available\nfacilities, the variety of program funding, and the research interests of the\nstaff constitute a whole that is greater\nthan the sum of its parts.\nOf course, none of the laboratories is\nlimited to photonics work alone, and\nthe CHTM is part of the University of\nNew Mexico\'s Optical Sciences Program, which offers a Ph.D. jointly administered by the Physics and Astronomy and the Electrical Engineering and\nComputer Engineering departments. Yet\neven when confined to photonics, the\nindividual capabilities are considerable.\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\n\n17\t\n\nhas major programs in\nlasers, fiber optic communications links and sensors,\nnonlinear optical components, electro-optics and\ninfrared detectors. Along\nwith extensive materials\ncharacterization capabilities\nand a high-speed (100\nGHz) device characterization laboratory, it has 2500\nsquare feet devoted to electronic device fabrication.\nLos Alamos\' work in\nOptical sensing, though\nuiiee dictated by the severe\nenvironmental demands of\nspecific weapons development, has proven to have\napplications in the commercial sector, particularly in\nenvironmental sensing and\nmedical applications. Within the Chemistry and Laser\nSciences division, programs\nin coherent Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence and laser-induced\nbreakdown spectroscopy, as\nwell as lidar, are useful in combustion\nchemistry and in contaminant monitoring of soils and the atmosphere. In the\nsame division the focus of medical diagnostics effort is on laser ablation using\n1-lOW 800nm diode lasers coupled into\noptical fibers for urology and other surgical applications.\nIn the sector of fiber optic sensors,\na wide variety of work, once driven by\nnuclear testing and related security issues, now goes on in measurement of\nelectrical current, magnetic fields using\nFaraday rotation, optical time domain\nreflectometry and resonant-ring techniques, optical-emission temperature\nmeasurement, and neutron imaging\nusing scintillating fibers. One device\nalready being characterized in the field\nis an interferometric fiber optic load sensor that records signatures from ground\ncompression caused by passing vehicles.\nAn array of such sensors could measure\ntraffic flow and vehicle weight, velocity,\nand position from beside, rather than\nbeneath, the road.\nSandia National Laboratories are\nconducting major programs in surfaceand edge-emitting laser diodes and\nWINTER 1994\n\nA dome scatterometer at the\nUniversity of New Mexico\'s\nCenter for High Technology\nMaterials shows diffraction patterns from illuminating a 256K\nstatic random access memory\nfabricated at Sematech. The\npatterns reveal properties of\nthe structure, such as line\nwidth and height.\n\narrays, visible and infrared modulators,\nimage acquisition and analysis, waveguides and detectors, optical signal processing systems, optical logic elements,\nand wide-bandgap materials.\nDevices resulting from work at Sandia include a reflectance-based fiber\nchemical sensor, a new class of chemical\ndetector based on the change in reflectivity of thin metal and/or polymeric\nfilms deposited on the end of an optical\nfiber. Its uses include detection of tnchlorothyrene, hydrogen gas, and many\nother chemicals. Another development\nis a glucose monitor that uses infrared\nlight to measure blood sugar, employing\ninfrared spectroscopy and advanced statistical techniques that were originally\ndeveloped to analyze aging explosives.\nSandia also is participating in a joint\neffort to develop technology for a monitoring system to detect and characterize\nhigh-energy lasers firing into the atmosphere. Sandia\'s Optoelectronic Design\nDepartment has developed an optical\nsensor capable of measuring average\nincident irradiance, signal wavelength,\nand a two-dimensional angle of departure from 300 meters while "looking"\ninto a brightly sunlit sky.\nEXAMINING LASER BEHAVIOR\n\nAt the US Air Force\'s Phillips Laboratory there are more than 9000 square\nfeet devoted to research labs with stateof-the-art diagnostic equipment and\ncomputer modeling support from workstations to a Cray 2. Phillips\' programs\nrange from nonlinear coupling of lasers\nand nonlinear optics to examinations of\nthe behavior of mid-infrared lasers and\nspatial light modulators. Phillips also\nmanages all of the Air Force\'s telescope\ninstallations, including the Starfire\nOptical Range, located with it at\nLASER TECH BRIEFS\t\n\nKirtland Air Force Base.\nThe Starfire Optical Range\nperforms field experiments\non, and analyses of the problems\nimposed by, atmospheric turbulence on\npropagating optical radiation. One significant area of experimentation is the use of\nadaptive optics to perform real-time compensation for atmosphere-induced aberrations. Equipment includes a 1.5-meteraperture telescope, a 1 meter-aperture coelostat\nbeam director, smaller\ntelescopes used for\natmospheric measurements, and an extensive\nadaptive optics laboratory with a second-generation adaptive optics\nsystem and four deformable mirrors.\nA strikingly different component from\nthe Phillips Laboratory\nis now commercially\navailable. Part of a\nLaser Medical Pac still\nunder development,\nthe laser component is tunable from the\nvisible red to the mid-infrared and can\nprovide different tissue interactions. The\nPac is powered by two 2V batteries to\noperate the laser and one 9V battery for\nthe electronics. The laser light is delivered to the instrument by fiber optic\ncable, providing very intense power density at the tip. The Medical Pac currently is being evaluated as a means of stopping bleeding.\nThe University of New Mexico\'s\nCenter for High Technology Materials\nconcentrates on optoelectronic and\nsemiconductor development. Among its\nfacilities are class-100 clean rooms, met18\t\n\nallorganic chemical vapor deposition\n(MOCVD) and liquid-phase epitaxy\nchambers for submicron device fabrication, and analytical capabilities ranging\nfrom scanning electron microscopy and\ntunnelling electron microscopy to various field-emission spectroscopies. The\noptics program revolves around ferntosecond linear and nonlinear spectroscopies, and thin film research.\nThe Alliance for Photonic Technology characterizes itself as a facilitator,\nnot a contracting agent: all contracts on\njoint undertakings or licensing are done\ndirectly between the customer company\nand the Alliance\'s R&D participants. Its\npart is to add value. With its in-depth\nknowledge of the capabilities of and syn-\n\nThe highest-power continuous-wave red\nlaser beam ever produced was demonstrated recently at the Phillips Laboratory\'s\nChemical Laser Facility, Nearly 700 watts\nwas produced at 657 nanometers by using\na lithium iodate nonlinear crystal in a\nfocused beam external to the laser cavity\nto frequency-double the 1.315-micrometer\noutput of the RotoCOlL high-power chemical oxygen-iodine laser.\n\nergies among its participants, specific\ncontacts within the labs, and on-site\nproject coordination, the Alliance offers\na single point through which to obtain\naccess to the labs\' multiple facilities.\nWINTER 1994\n\nELECTRONIC COMPONENTS\nAND CIRCUITS\nVertical-Cavity Microlasers Move Into the Visible\nBreakthroughs in operating efficiency and visible wavelength emission promise wide\napplications for semiconductor microlasers.\nSandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico\nA variety of applications will soon see a\nseries of new vertical-cavity microlasers. By\ncombining pioneering strained-layer semiconductors with precise methods for the\ngrowth of epitaxial heteroj unction mirrors,\nthe barrier to obtaining visible-light emission as well as the barrier of high electrical resistance which previously limited the\noperating efficiency, and thus the practical utility, of these laser devices have been\novercome. It is now conceivable that more\nthan 100,000 of these microlasers could\nbe grown on a single 2-inch wafer, with\neach tiny laser putting out enough power\nto pump light through an optical fiber.\nVertical-cavity microlasers rely on stacks\nof heterojunction mirrors formed along the\nsurface plane that create a Fabry-Perot\ncavity around an active gain region. These\nvertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, or\nvcsELs (pronounced "vixels"), emit light\ndirectly out of the surface of the semiconductor from which they are grown.\nCompared to the traditional edge-emitting semiconductor lasers, vcsELs, with\ntheir emission perpendicular to the chips\'\nsurface, make it easier to fashion closelypacked arrays of lasers, produce tight,\ncircular beams, and couple more easily\nto optical fibers. Perhaps equally significant is the fact that, whereas edge-emitting diode lasers must be individually\ncleaved, aligned, and packaged before\nuse, VcsELs can be fully fabricated and\ntested directly on the semiconductor wafer\nusing integrated circuit technology. Hence\nthese devices could play the same role in\nthe miniaturization of lasers as integrated\ncircuits played for the miniaturization of\ntransistors.\nvcsELs emitting in the near-infrared\n(near 860 nm) have been available for several years: however, their broad application has been hindered by limited output\npower and poor efficiency. New research\nadvances have contributed to overcoming these barriers by developing advanced\nprocessing schemes for fabrication of the\nvcSELs as well as precision epitaxial\ngrowth methods to maintain high reflectivity in the distributed Bragg reflector\nLASER TECH\n\nBElIE.\t\n\nFigure 1.\nLasing\nemission\nfrom the first\nelectrically\ninjected\nvisible-light\nverticalcavity\nsurfaceemitting\naser\nVCSEL).\n\n(DBR) mirrors while grading the aluminum\nand gallium concentrations between\nalternating mirror layers so as to reduce\nthe electrical barriers at the semiconductor mirror interlaces. These advances\nhave facilitated top-surface-emitting\nVCSEL device demonstrations where\nthreshold voltages of less than 1.5 V and\nconversion efficiencies nearing 16% have\nbeen realized.\nOn an entirely separate front, recent\nwork in the indium-aluminum-galliumphosphide (InAlGaP) material system has\nenabled the realization of VCSEL devices\nthat emit at visible wavelengths (Figure 1).\nThis innovation is expected to lead to\ngreatly expanded applications for VCSEL\ntechnology, which was previously limited\nto near-infrared wavelengths. The visible\nVCSEL is grown over a commercially available GaAs substrate using metallorganic\nchemical vapor deposition. Alternating\nquarter-wavelength-thick layers of AlAs\nand AIGaAs (Figure 2) create the semiconductor mirrors that form the FabryPerot cavity. The light-emitting heart of\nthese devices is the optical cavity corn19\t\n\nposed of several 10- nano meter-thick layers of alternate compositions of InAIGaP.\nBy varying the thickness and mole-fraction of each element of the quaternary alloy\nin the active region, a series of quantum\nwells is created in which composition, lattice mismatch (differences in the equilibrium atomic lattice spacings of the quaternary materials), and precise layer\nthicknesses determine the allowed energy\nstates of electrons and holes, and thus\nthe emission wavelength.\nCritical to the realization of these devices\nwas direct experience in tuning the electronic and optical properties of lattice-mismatched epitaxial heterojunction layers\nresulting from pioneering work on strainedlayer semiconductors. By employing\nstrained-layer semiconductors to shift the\nbandgap of the materials, the team\nobtained continuous-wave room-temperature emission at wavelengths from 691\nnm to 628nm. Also critical was precise\ncontrol of the growth conditions, to create\na gain medium that emitted light at the\nprecise frequency to match the resonant\nfrequency of the Fabry-Perot cavity.\nWINTER 1994\n\nFigure 2.\nSchematic\nof the red\n\nVCSEL\n\nlasing\nstructure,\n\nLight Out\n(not to scale)\n\nIn addition to potential applications for\nvisible displays, this recent advance\nshould enable applications for VCSELs\nas ow-cost print heads for laser printers,\nas sources for low-cost, rugged, plasticfiber-based optical networks, and even\nas potential replacements for gas-laserbased bar-code scanners at supermarket checkouts.\nThis work was done by Richard P.\n\nSchneider, Kevin L.

The need for\ncompletely reprogrammable radar signalprocessing systems in particular has been\nrecently emphasized to allow modifications to be easily made via software\nupgrades.\nOne advanced processing approach\nunder investigation involves the use of\ndensely populated arrays of optoelectronic\nswitches interconnected by bundles of\nlarge numbers of information-carrying light\nrays. Millions of rays per bundle are possible, each carrying digital information at\ngreater than gigahertz rates. In the analogous electronics case, several hundred\nelectrical bus lines carrying information at\nseveral dozen kilohertz is the practical limit.\nHence there is a theoretical 100,000,000to-i throughput advantage for optical interconnects.\nPast SEED-based optical computing\napproaches used large, power-hungry\nexternal lasers and inefficient fan-out optics\nto power the switch arrays, and fixed optical masks to determine the static processing function.

Such arrays of microlaser\ndevices for the first time aid in building a\nWINTER 1994\n\nreprogrammable, efficient, compact and\nhigh-speed computing system.\nIn this scaled-down system experiment,\nfour bits of information stored in four rows\nof an optical SEED array were scrolled\nrow-to-row by four 850nm laser diodes\nwhile a four-by-eight array of VCSELs input\nnew data and control bits. In this fashion\nreprogrammable, general-purpose computing including digital signal processing\ncan be accomplished. This primitive firstgeneration system ran at 30 kilohertz, controlled by the 100+ microwatt VCSEL5. In\nthe future more efficient switch arrays and\nhigher-power VCSELs will allow gigahertz\n\nsystems to be built. Also, the SEEDs used\nwere first-generation optoelectronic switch\ndevices, performing a simple latching function. The use of more complex so-called\nsmart-pixel" arrays, combining the exceptional logic capabilities of electronics with\nthe great interconnect power of optics,\nundoubtedly in a wafer-scale integration\nor muttichip module electronic architecture, will enable digital signal processors\nwith extraordinary computational capabilities to be fabricated in 5 to 10 years. The\nmating of photonic VCSEL technology to\nadvanced optoelectronics thus represents\na significant insertion of photonics tech-\n\nnology into practical defense and commercial systems. Commercial offshoots of\nthis technology may eventually make current electronic computing approaches\nobsolete.\n\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this technology should be\naddressed to Rome Laboratory, Office of\nthe JA, Griffiss Air Force Base, NY 13441.\nThe SEED-VCSEL processor was developed by J.

In addition, such EELs offer the\npossibilities of very short pulses, down to\n\n100 femtoseconds or shorter. Work being\ndone at the National Synchrotron Light\nSource (NSLS) department utilizes the\nAccelerator Test Facility (ATF), a linear\naccelerator (linac) and laser complex capable of producing high-brightness electron\nbeams and high-power laser pulses syn-\n\nchronized with the electrons.\nOne component needed for a successful UV EEL is a laser-photocathode\nRF gun.

The generation and careful manipulation of such beams are an area of\nintense activity in accelerator physics,\nviewed by many as the key to short-wavelength EELs.\nFree-electron laser experiments on the\nATF include work on a visible-wavelength\nFEL oscillator and high-gain harmonic generation. These systems use novel superconducting undulators providing a high\nfield and very low magnetic-field error.\nThe FEL harmonic-generation principle\nis shown in Figure 2. The undulator has\nthree distinct regions. The seed radiation,\nin this experiment from a CO 2 laser, is\ninjected into the modulator section, which\nis resonant to its wavelength. The energymodulated electron beam is bunched\nmagnetically in the dispersive section. The\nbunched beam radiates coherently in the\nnext undulator section, now resonant at\nthe third harmonic of the seed radiation.\nThis radiation is amplified exponentially up\nto saturation, and then beyond saturation,\nby a tapered undulator section.\nThis experiment emulates the UV FEL\nphysics at a longer wavelength. Multiple\nharmonic generation may be the best way\nto build an x-ray free-electron laser for a\nnumber of reasons. First, it avoids the dif-\n\nficulty of building x-ray resonator mirrors.\nThe availability of high-power seed lasers\nmakes the necessary undulator short in\ncomparison with some FEL schemes, and\nthe radiation bandwidth and wavelength\nstability are superb.\nUsing these techniques, the department is designing an accelerator-based\nUV radiation source that will provide\npicosecond and subpicosecond pulses\nof coherent UV radiation for wavelengths\nfrom 300 to 75nm. The pulsewidth will be\nvariable from about 7 picoseconds to less\nthan 200 femtoseconds, with pulse repetition rates as high as 360Hz and peak\npulse power of the order of 1 gigawatt in\na 10 bandwidth.\nThe UV FEL electron beam is generated\nby the laser photocathode RF gun already\ndescribed, accelerated to 300MeV by a\nlinac and then sent to an undulator. The\nradiation is generated by a tunable Ti-sapphire laser, multiplied by conventional techniques to the visible or near-UV. Then,\nusing the high-gain harmonic generation\ntechnique, vacuum UV (VUV) radiation is\ngenerated and amplified. The radiation\npulse length and the intensity-vs. -time profile can be adjusted at the seed laser.\nThis proposed FEL will provide highpeak-power VUV radiation with the mode\nstructure, bandwidth, and frequency stability of an input seed laser. The peak\npower of this source makes it ideal for\nresearch in dilute samples, such as the\nElectron Beam In\n(30Mev 1 OOA)\t\n\ngas phase, surface adsorbates or transient species such as radicals produced in\na molecular-beam interaction. The narrow\nbandwidth and tunability are excellent for\nresonant processes such as threshold\nspectroscopies and the study of excited\nstates. The short pulse and intensity programmability are suited to relaxation and\nexcitation processes and coherent control of quantum dynamics, and could make\npossible new avenues of inquiry in timeresolved studies in diverse fields including\nchemical, surface and solid-state physics,\nbiology and material science.\nTwo Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) have been\nestablished between BNL and Grumman\nAerospace, one for development of the\nadvanced RF gun, and the second to build\nthe 2-meter-long undulator for the harmonic-generation experiment.\n\nThis work is being done by Ilan Ben-Zvi,\nKenneth Batchelor, Erik Johnson, Samuel\nKrinsky, and Li-Hua Yu of the NSLS\ndepartment and the Center for Accelerator Physics at BNL, and Ira Lehrman of\nGrumman Aerospace.

A novel URSL device uses an inte- \t\ngrated regrown lens train (RLT) to pro-\t\n\t\nvide the unstable resonator action. These\n\n22\t\n\nRLT lasers can be fabricated for different\nwavelengths, including the important 920980nm range, where laser pump sources\nWINrER 1994\n\nFigure 1.\nHigher Order Mode\n\nFundamental Mode\nare needed in Er-doped fiber amplifiers,\nfrequency doublers and fiber upconversion lasers.\nIn a generic unstable resonator laser\n(Figure 1) the optical mode is made to\ndiverge slightly as it travels through the\nlaser cavity. This divergence can be\nachieved by curving one of the mirrors,\nas shown in the figure, or by alternative\napproaches. Higher-order (off-axis) modes\ndiverge rapidly and pass out of the laser\ncavity, so the unstable resonator discriminates in favor of fundamental-mode\noperation.\nThe advantages of the UASL can best\nbe understood by examining the limitations of the conventional Fabry-Perot (FP)\ntype of semiconductor laser. In this laser,\nsingle-spatial-mode operation can be\nobtained only for narrow beamwidths,\nwhich result in a high power density at the\nfacet. Therefore the output power is typically limited by the onset of facet damage.\nIf wider beamwidths are used, then the\npower density is lower, but several lateral\nmodes occur. So the FP semiconductor\nlaser can provide either good spatial coherence or high power, but not both.\nIn the unstable resonator laser, higherorder spatial modes incur a higher roundtrip loss (see Figure 1). This means that\nthe onset of lasing for the higher-order\nmodes, and thus the loss of spatial coherence, is shifted to higher power levels. Furthermore, much larger laser stripe widths\ncan be used, allowing high output power\nlevels, while avoiding high power densities at the facet. So the URSL laser offers\nhigh power and spatial coherence together\nin the same device.\nA novel URSL approach is shown in Figure 2. In this device the lasing mode is\nshared between two parts of a double"\noptical waveguide. The main part (A) is a\nconventional quantum-well gradient-index\nseparate carrier heterostructure (GRINSCH) design that provides gain and transverse waveguiding for the lasing mode.\nThe second part of the waveguide (B) is\nlocated above the main part and causes\nthe lasing mode to diverge laterally. This\ndivergence results from a lateral variation\nof effective refractive index that is achieved\nby integrating diverging "lens-like" elements into part B of the waveguide.\nThe epitaxial layers of GaAs, AIGaAs\nand strained lnGaAs that form the laser\nstructure are grown by metallorganic\nL.ASER TECH BRItI\'\n\nEtched lens-train\t\n\nUnstable\nresonator\nprinciple is\n\na,\n\nFigure 2.

This output can be focused\nto a spot size that is only 1.2X that of a\ndiffraction-limited (perfectly coherent) laser.\nA slightly different laser design has produced a peak output power of about 2 W\npulsed, with a far-field lobe width of only\n3X the diffraction-limited width.

Such designs\nrequire a polarizer/analyzer pair and\noperating voltages capable of inducing\na half-wave phase shift over the entire\noptical beam aperture.\nTwo-sided electrode fabrication to\nincrease the electro-optic interaction\nlength of the devices reduces the\nswitching voltage of present commercial\nPLZT spatial light modulators. Yet even\nwith the increase in interaction length\nprovided by these designs, the minimum switching voltage of commercial\nPLZT polarization-rotation-based spatial\nlight modulators is 350 volts.But a new\ndiffraction-based spatial light modulator\nutilizing transparent indium tin oxide\n(ITO) as the electrode material yields a\nswitching voltage of 140 volts. The electro-optic interaction length for such a\nPLZT/ITO phase grating has been conservatively estimated as 75 microns.\nThe figure presents the diffraction\npattern of the PLZT/ITO electro-optic\nphase grating for a sequence of applied\nvoltages. At zero applied voltage, the\nintrinsic diffraction pattern of the ITO\nsurface electrodes is present. The intrinsic diffraction pattern could be eliminated through the utilization of appropriate\nindex-matching coatings.

Incorporation of wavelengthtunable section permits beamsteering.\nthe light sources for these circuits should\nemit from a semiconductor surface layer\nrather than from the edge, as conventional\nlaser diodes do. A surface-emitting structure enables the monolithic integration of\nthe laser with optical and electronic\ndevices, and therefore has application in\noptoelectronic integrated circuits used for\ncomputer optical interconnects.\nMonolithic grating-surface-emitting\n(GSE) semiconductor lasers use Bragg\ngrating structures as cavity reflectors for\noptical feedback, and in this respect differ both from conventional edge-emitting\nlasers (feedback exclusively from cleaved\nfacets) and from edge-emitting distributed\nfeedback (DFB) lasers (feedback from two\ncleaved facets combined with that from a\nBragg grating). Gratings also provide output coupling needed to extract information from a chip; the degree of out-coupling depends on the detailed fabrication\nfrom the grating structure.\nGSE lasers comprise a family of devices\nincluding (1) monolithic discrete GSE\nlasers, (2) master-oscillator-power-amplifier (MOPA) devices (Figure 1), and (3) GSE\nlaser arrays of these devices.\nThe unique fabrication process of GSE\nlasers leads to several advantages and\nfeatures; gratings are patterned either by\nholographic exposure of photoresist or Ebeam exposure of resists such as PMMA\nor PB-TMSS. Unlike vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, for which grating layers may be epitaxially grown, the emitted\npower can be high while single-spatialmode beam quality is maintained. Monolithic integration of GSE lasers with highspeed electronic circuitry is at an advanced\nstage of research development (Figure 2,\npage 27).

(3) This birefringence manifests itself in one fast\' axis and\none "slow" axis, both perpendicular to the\ndirection of propagation and to each other.\nThe switch (see Figure 2) can operate\n\non coherent light (e.g., from a laser) or incoherent but nevertheless narrow-spectrum\nlight (e.g., from a light-emitting diode). The\nbeam of light from the source passes\nthrough a polarizer, which allows only the\nvertically polarized part to enter the electro-optical crystal. When no voltage is\napplied to the electrodes on the upper and\nlower surfaces of the crystal, there is no\nelectric field; therefore, there is no birefringence, and the beam passes through\nthe crystal with its polarization unchanged.\nThe beam that emerges from the electrooptical crystal enters a beam-splitting polarizer; when its polarization is vertical, as it is\nin this case, it passes straight through the\nbeam-splitting polarizer and out along the\nlower one of two output paths.\nThe "fast" and "slow" axes of the crystal lie at 45\xc2\xb0 to the vertical axis. The vertically polarized light can be regarded as consisting of two components: one polarized\nalong the "fast" axis and one polarized along\nthe "slow" axis. When a voltage is applied\nto the electrodes, the "fast" -polarized component propagates through the crystal faster\nthan the "slow-polarized component, with\nresultant rotation of the polarization of the\nlight beam. The dimensions of the crystal\nand the applied voltage can be chosen so\nlight\nthat the net rotation is 90\xc2\xb0; that is, the th*t\nemerges from the electro-optical crystal is\npolarized horizontally. In this case, the beamsplitting polarizer directs the beam upward\nto a prism, which reflects it out along the\nupper one of two output paths (or other\noutput devices).

The energy-conversion efficiency\nof a solar photovoltaic cell is reduced\nwhen a portion of the light incident on the\nsurface of the cell is lost by reflection. An\nantireflection coat reduces this reflection\nloss but cannot reduce reflection to zero\nover the entire solar spectrum. Various\nsurface textures, including grooves or\npyramids, have been proposed to reduce\nreflection, but the fabrication of cells with\nsuch textures requires complicated processing and often involves decreases of\nthe efficiency, reliability, and yield, along\nwith increases in the cost of manufacture.\nIn an improved method of increasing\nthe efficiency of cells made of indium\nphosphide (a high-efficiency, radiationtolerant solar-cell material), the surface of\neach cell is textured with low-angle Vgrooves. The angle of the grooves is choCover Glass\t Index of\nRefraction = 1 41\n\nsen so that the light reflected from the surface of the cell is trapped in the cell cover\nglass and adhesive by total internal reflection and is thus recovered and reflected\nback onto the cell (see figure).\nThe low-angle V-grooves are fabricated by a simple HcI-etch technique,\nwith no requirement for alignment or\nphotoresist masking. In addition to reducing the loss by reflection from the\nsurface of the solar-cell material, the\netched grooves can also help to recover\nlight incident on the metal contacts on\nthe surface of the cell, which light is lost\non conventional solar cells. The output\ncurrents of solar cells made by use of\nthis technique have been demonstrated\nto be 8 percent greater than those of\notherwise identical cells made without\nthe improved surface etch. Greater increases in outputs are expected with\nfurther refinements in processing.\nThis method can be applied to many\ndevices. InP solar cells are highly resistant\n\n2.7% (From 100\t %\t\nTotal Incident)\t\n\nto damage by ionizing radiation and thus\nare promising candidates for use in outer\nspace. Similar reflection-reduction techniques could increase the efficiencies of\nsolar cells in solar-energy-concentration\nsystems that would provide electrical\npower at terrestrial sites. Indium phosphide also serves as a base material for\noptoelectronic devices, including optical\ndetectors, which are used for a wide variety of applications, including optical-fiber\ncommunications. Reduction of reflection\nlosses in such applications would\nincrease the efficiencies of detectors\nused in them. Similarly, low-angle\ngrooves could be used to reduce surface reflections in devices made of such\nother semiconductor materials as GaAs.\n\nThis work was done by Sheila G.

The incorporation of this\nconcept into the design of the proposed diode laser is expected to result\nin a high-power, laterally coherent, diffraction-limited beam that fills a large\noutput aperture. In addition, the separation of mode-definition and poweramplification functions would enable\nthe separate optimization of each.\nThe unstable-resonator oscillator would\nbe bounded at its ends by feedback reflectors in the form of hyperbolic surface diffraction gratings. The hyperbolic\nstructure would provide an aberrationfree oscillator output diverging from an\napparent point source; that is, the lowpower output beam of the oscillator\nwould be wide and uniform with coherence along circular wave fronts. The portion of this beam transmitted by the hyperbolic-grating mirror at the broader\nend of the oscillator would be injected\ninto the power amplifier.\nThe power amplifier would be energized via an electrical contact separate\nfrom that of the oscillator. This power\namplifier would operate in a travelingwave mode and would have a divergingbeam, single-pass geometry, which\nwould suppress the tendency toward\nself-focusing and the consequent filamentation of the laser beam.\nThe amplified beam would be directed to\nan elliptical grating, which would serve as a\ndetuned output coupler. Detuning would\nsuppress spurious reflection of the output\nbeam back into the amplifier. Inasmuch as\nthe amplified beam (with a typical maxilASER TECH RRH 1\n\n,\t\n\nmum power of 1 W) would be spread over\na relatively large area (>100 xl 00 pm2),\npower density at each facet of the grating\nwould be relatively low.

With\ncomplete flexibility in the shapes of the\ngratings, it would also be possible to\nmodify the output-coupling grating\ngeometry to account for thermal lensing\nand other parasitic effects. The use of\nsurface gratings (as distinguished from\nother types of gratings or other reflector structures) would make the fabrication process simpler and more reliable\nthan it would otherwise be, in that only\na single growth step and a single grating-fabrication step would be needed.\nNo cleaving or etching of facets perpendicular to the broad surfaces\nwould be needed.\n\nThis work was done by Robert J.\nLang, Michael Mitte/stein, Richard C.\nTiberio, Siamak Forouhar, and Deborah\nCrawford of Ca/tech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

This capability has significantly\nexpanded the number of ions and transitions that have been demonstrated to be\nuseful as lasants. As the number of ]asant ions and accessible transitions has\ngrown, so has the diversity in the wavelength of diode-pumped solid-state laser\n(DPSSL) systems and the number of applications for which they are being pursued.\nAt present, DP55Ls are being contemplated and developed for atmospheric and\nspace-based lidar systems, underwater\nillumination and sensing, wind-shear sensing, remote sensing of chemical species,\nlithographic processing, medical applications, and electronic and material processing applications. The ability to focus\nor condense the output from semiconductor diode laser arrays to high intensities is important for the efficient operation\nof lasers in many of these applications\nbecause of the high pump intensities\nrequired to efficiently excite the laser ions\nto useful levels.\nOne drawback the diode end-pumped\narchitecture has suffered from until now\nhas been the limited number of diode apertures that could be combined into a single\nfocused beam. This has limited the peak\nand average power-scaling capability of\nthe end-pumping architecture and\nrestricted the number of systems in which\nit could be usefully implemented. In the\npast, when peak or average power-scaling was required in a DPSSL it was necessary to use a transverse pump geometry, one in which the diode arrays are\nplaced juxtaposed to the laser crystal and\nWINTER 1994\n\nMultiple Pages Intentionally Left\nBlank\n\nessentially flood the crystal with pump radiation. In this approach no attempt is made\nto combine and focus the output radiation of the diodes into a single spot, and\nthe pump intensity at the crystal is limited\nto approximately the pump intensity coming off the diode arrays today at most\nseveral kW/cm. These low pump intensities have restricted the use of the transverse pump geometry to the Nd ion.\nThe end-pump geometry, which can\ngenerate pump intensities of 100 kW/cm",\nhas been aided by the development that\nallows the simple scaling of the peak and\naverage power capability of this geometry\nto the kilowatt range. The stumbling block\nin the development of a scalable diode\nend-pumping architecture has been the\nintrinsically low effective radiance of the\ntwo-dimensional emitting apertures constructed from a stack of laser diode array\nbars. The low effective radiance of arrays\nresults from the fact that the diode radiation is generated in a waveguide structure\nhaving at least one transverse dimension\napproximately equal to the radiation\'s\nwavelength. This results in a beam of radiation with high divergence angle, on the\norder of 600 in one dimension, commonly\nreferred to as the fast-axis direction.\nThe key to overcoming the low radiance\nin the fast-axis direction is the optical conditioning of the diode radiation from individual bars. A very high-precision cylindrical microlens does just that, and is very\nlow-cost to produce in quantity using a\nfiber-pulling technique. Figure 1 is a crosssectional view of a high-average-power\nlaser package which utilizes microchannel cooling to enable 1 -cm-long diode\narray bars to generate 100W of continuous-wave optical output. The radiation,\ndiverging at approximately 600, is collected\nand collimated by the cylindrical microlens\nmounted on the front of the package. After\ncollimation the divergence of the diode\nlight is reduced to 0.611.\nThe microchannel-cooled packages can\nbe stacked at a pitch of 10 per cm to form\ntwo-dimensional arrays capable of generating average-power pump intensities of 1\nkW/cm at the array aperture. In such\nstacks, as has been seen, the microlens\nconditioning decreases the fast-axis divergence angle by approximately a factor of\n100. It is this decrease and the accompanying ability to focus the radiation to a\nsmaller spot than if no conditioning had\nbeen performed that enables the output\nradiation from large two-dimensional diode\nLASER ILCII BRIFI\n\nstacks to be efficiently delivered to the end\nof rod lasers.\nFigure 2 shows a drawing of an endpumped rod laser. The radiation from the\nmicrolens-conditioned array stack is delivered to the laser rod by a device called a\nlensing duct. This optical component can\nbe fabricated from any transparent optical material and relies on lensing at its\ncurved input face and total internal reflection on its canted planar faces to efficiently\nchannel the diode pump radiation to the\nlaser bar.

With the lensing duct the radiation\nthat would be delivered outside the aperture of the rod can still be efficiently channeled to the rod by reflecting off its canted\nplanar sides.\nIn summary, two technologies now\nenable the scalable laser diode endpumping of rod lasers. These are the ability to build high-density, high-averagepower laser diode arrays, and the\nmicrolens-conditioning/lensing duct system that enables the outputs of large twodimensional arrays to be efficiently delivered to the end of rod lasers. To date this\ntechnology has been used to build a 100mJ 0-switched Nd:YLF laser oscillator for\nuse in atmospheric and space-based lidar\nsystems, and a wing-pumped Cr:LiSAF\nlaser using 770-nm AlGaAs laser diode\narrays. Presently, the end-pumping tech-\n\nnology is being pursued in the demonstration of a 2-mm Tm:YAG laser for medical applications.\nOne very promising commercial development foreseen to emerge with this technology is in the area of high-average-power\nDPSSL systems for material-processing\napplications in which a rod laser technology uses Yb:YAG as the gain element.\nThe high intensities that can be generated\nwith the end-pumping technology offer an\nopportunity to overcome the deleterious\nground-state reabsorption problem of the\nYb3+ ion. At the same time, advantage\ncan be taken of the very small thermal\npower generation parameter of the Yb3+\nion by using the high-average-power capability of the diode laser technology to implement a high-average-power DPSSL system that uses a very simple rod-laser\napproach.

The critical dimension scale\nof photolithography is approximately half\na micrometer today, and projections are\nthat it wil be 0.1 micrometer within the\ndecade.

Alternatively,the\nrange of a tunable Tm,Ho:YLF laser can\nbe extended by simply tuning to a wavelength between CO2 and H20 absorption\npeaks.\nPump light is supplied by a 500-mW\nGaAIAs diode laser tuned to a wavelength of 792 nm. The collimated pump\nbeam has an elliptical cross section. To\nenhance the stability of output in the face\nof small misalignments and to optimize\npumping efficiency, the pump beam is\nmade nearly circular by use of an anamorphic pair of prisms. The beam is\nthen focused onto the input face of the\nTm,Ho:YLF crystal. The dichroic coat on\nthis face transmits most of the light at\nthe pump wavelength (792 nm) and reflects most of the light at the output laser\nwavelength (at or near 2.067 pm).\nThe laser resonator is that portion of\nthe optical train that lies between the input\ndichroic face of the Tm,Ho:YLF crystal and\nan output spherical mirror of 10-cm\nradius. An uncoated fused-silica\nFabry-Perot etalon 0.25 mm thick is\nplaced within the resonator. The output\nFigure 1. The\nContinuousWave, DiodePumped\nTm,Ho:YLF\nLaser is tuned\nby tilting the\nFabry-Pe rot\netalon and/or\nadjusting the\ntemperature of\nthe Tm,Ho:YLF\ncrystal.\n\nlaser wavelength is tuned over the 7-nm\nrange by tilting the etalon to angles up to\n70. In the absence of the etalon, the output laser spectrum consists of multiple\npeaks attributable to Fabry- Perot action\nin the Tm,Ho:YLF crystal. The thickness\nof the etalon is chosen so that the free\nspectral range of the etalon (the interval\nbetween the peaks of its transmission\nspectrum) exceeds that of the\nTm,Ho:YLF crystal and thus the etalon\nrestricts the laser oscillation to only one\nof the peaks of the laser spectrum. As\nan additional benefit, this concentration\nof the available laser gain into one electromagnetic mode makes the laser capable\nof oscillation at wavelengths farther from\nthe middle of the gain bandwidth.\nThe output power of the laser was\nmeasured as a function of pump power,\noutput wavelength, and temperature of\nthe Tm,Ho:YLF crystal. A maximum output power of 84 mW was measured at\nan absorbed pump power of 200 mW at\na temperature of 275 K, indicating a\nconversion efficiency of 42 percent. The\nextrapolated threshold absorbed pump\npower was found to be 60 mW, and the\nslope efficiency (increase in output power/increase in absorbed pump power)\nwas found to be 60 percent - believed\nto be the highest yet reported for a\nTm,Ho:YLF laser operating near room\ntemperature.\nFigure 2 illustrates the tunability of the\nlaser via rotation of the etalon at a temperature of 256 K.

By\nmeasuring and processing the times of\nshadowing of beams from low-power\nhelium-neon lasers, the system provides\ndata on the deflections of the leading and\ntrailing edges of blade sections at three\nspanwise locations. The system is\ndesigned to accommodate the complicated shape and nonlinear deflections of\nrotating propfan blades.\nIn addition to 0.5-mW HeNe lasers, the\nsystem includes Schottky-barrier photodetectors, neutral-density filters, signal\namplifiers, an output-signal-recording device, and a digitizer. Each laser used to\nmeasure deflections is oriented so that its\nbeam of light passes through the plane of\nrotation of the propfan blades (see figure),\nand when not obstructed by a blade, the\nbeam impinges on a photodetector, producing a positive voltage signal on it. Three\nsuch laser/photodiode pairs are usedc\'ne for each of the measurement locations on the propeller span. The neutraldensity filters are placed on the photodetectors to attenuate the laser beams to\na safe level.\nWhen the propfan blades interrupt the\nlaser beams during rotation, the photodetectors produce negative voltage\npulses. A narrow beam is essential to\n\nffl\n\ngeneration of the square-wave pulses\nthat are required for proper analysis of\ndeflections.\nA fourth laser is positioned so that its\nbeam is reflected from a mirror located\non the propeller shaft to a photodetector.\nThis laser/photodetector pair provides a\nonce-per-revolution pulse as a reference\nfor analysis.\nThe amplifiers process the four photodetector signals, which are then recorded on magnetic tape. The taped signals\nare digitized and fed to a computer for\nanalysis. A specially developed computer\ncode calculates the displacements of the\nblade sections at each of the three spanwise measurement stations.\nThe system has been adapted for use\nin a vacuum chamber for correlation of\nfinite-element simulations of deflections.\nMeasurements were done at a low pressure of 1 torr (about 0.13 kPa) to reduce\naerodynamic effects to negligible levels\nand thus concentrate only on centrifugal\neffects. In this application, the low-pressure air around the laser electrodes ionized, short-circuiting them and extinguishing the lasers.

The receiver generates a 1 00-MHz signal with reduced noise.\nIt contains a 1 00-MHz voltage-controlled\nquartz-crystal oscillator (VCO) locked in\nphase to a superconducting-cavity maser\noscillator (scMO). The SCMO, in turn,\ncan be locked in phase to the hydrogen\nmaser, thus effectively phase-locking the\nreceiver and its scMo/ vco combination\nto the hydrogen maser.\nAspects of the SCMO have been described in previous reports, including\n"Performance of superconducting-Cavity\nMaser" (NPO- 18175), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol.\n15, No. 6 (June 1991), page 30. This is\nan all-cryogenic, helium-cooled, three-cavity oscillator that consists of a ruby maser,\na coupling cavity, and a superconducting\nlead-lined resonator cavity filled with sapphire. The ruby and resonator frequencies\nare matched by applying a bias magnetic\nfield of about 500 gauss. The output power\nof this oscillator is >1 0 W, which is more\nthan 103 times that of the hydrogen maser;\nthis relatively large output power makes it\npossible to obtain \'1,000 30 times the\nstability of the hydrogen maser at short (of\nthe order of 1 s) measuring times.\nAn additional electromagnet coil installed\non the ruby housing is used to vary the\nbias field to tune the SCMO to maintain\n\nphase lock with the hydrogen maser. The\noverall tuning range of the SCMO is only\n1/1,000 that of the voltage-controlled\nquartz-crystal oscillator but is sufficient to\naccommodate the typical SCMO drift of\n4 xl 0-13 per day in long-term operation.\nThe double phase-locked loop is designed to combine optimally the inherent\nhigh medium-term frequency stability of\nthe hydrogen maser with the inherent high\nshort-term stability of the SCMO. As used\nhere, "short-term" and "medium-term"\ndenote measuring times (T\'s) of the order of\n1 and 103 s, respectively. Specific design\ngoals are to preserve short-term stability\nof the SCMO through the phase-locked\nloop 1 and to optimize the phase-locked\nloop 2 so that the medium-term performance of the hydrogen maser is preserved\nwithout significantly degrading the performance at t = 1 s. In a test, measured\ntwo-source fractional frequency stabilities\nof 2 xl 0-14 and lx 10-15 were obtained\nat t = 1 s and t = 1,000 s, respectively.\nThe 1-s value is approximately one tenth\nthat of hydrogen masers, while the 1,000s value is identical to that of the hydrogen\nmaser.\n\nV Programmable Control\n\nplugs into any PC with\nRS-232C interface\nV Compact & Simple Design\nV Scanning and Feeding\nV Testing and Manufacturing\nV 747 different Models\nV Send for free catalog\n\nFor More Information Write In No. 397\n\nThis work was done by Rabi I Wang\nand G.

As the wafer\ntemperature increases, the grating\nexpands, changing the diffraction angle.\nThe experimental arrangement is\nshown in Figure 1. Laser beams are symmetrically incident on the wafer\'s grating\nat an angle O. If the period, wavelength\nand incident angle are arranged so that\nthe (-)first-order diffraction is close to nor-\n\nmal to the surface, e.g., sin0 1 -X/d---0,\nthen the angle between the two output\nbeams, t, varies with temperature as:\n\nwhere is the thermal expansion coefficient.\nA vertically polarized HeNe laser beam\n(X = 633pm) is split into two parts and the\nincident beams make angles =\xc2\xb139.250\nwith a 1.3-pm grating such that -1 orders\ndiffracted from the grating are normal to\nthe sample.\nThe use of the symmetrically incident\nbeams provides a differential technique\nthat, to first order, is independent of\nwafer tilt and warping during heating. The\nlens in the figure maps the angular variations in its focal plane. Thus the temperature measurement is reduced to a simple\nlinear distance measurement that is readily performed with computer analysis of\nthe CCD camera\'s output.\nFor an independent comparison with\nthe optical technique, a thermocouple is\ncemented to the sample. A data acquisition system continuously monitors the\ndiffraction-order separation. For the present system, the images are acquired at\nTV frame rates (1/30 second). Signal proCs\n\ncessing takes about 2 seconds for nearreal-time measurements consistent with\nMBE requirements. Additional hardware\nand software development can easily\nachieve faster signal processing.\nA temperature resolution of less than\n1 \xc2\xb0C has been demonstrated over the\nentire range of interest for silicon processing (-150-1200 0C). The technique\nshows good agreement with published\nresults for silicon and gallium arsenide\nexpansion coefficients. It is simple, inexpensive and adaptable to real-time\nprocess control.\n\nThis work was done by Prof. S. R. J.\nBrueck, Dr. S. H.

The concept of these transducers\nwas derived from research on the waveguide electromagnetic modes of few-mode\noptical fibers. This research showed,\namong other things, that a single-mode\noptical fiber can be made sensitive or insensitive to strain or to a particular kind of\nstrain (e.g. axial or transverse strain) by\nappropriate choice of the design parameters of the fiber; these parameters include\nthe indices of refraction of the core and\ncladding, the radius of the core, the photoelastic constants, and the Poisson\'s\nratio. The wavelength of light must also be\nchosen in conjunction with these parameters because it affects the mode structure.\nA typical fiber-optic sensor of this type\n(see figure) would include a lead-in ngth, a\nshort sensing length, and a lead-out\nlength. A laser at the lead-in end would\nexcite the single-mode waveguide. The\ndesign parameters of the lead-in and leadout lengths would be chosen so that the\nphase shifts of the single mode in them\nwould be insensitive to strain. The design\nparameters of the sensing length would be\nchosen to make the phase shift of the single\nmode in that length sensitive or insensitive\nto a specific kind of strain (e.g., axial or\ntransverse strain or some combination of\nthese two). The phase shift would be measured and used to infer the strain in the\nshort sensing length, which would be\nattached to an object at a location subject\nto strain.\nIn an alternative version, multiple portions\nof an optical fiber could be designed to be\nsensitive to strains characteristic of a specific vibrational mode of an object. In contrast, prior fiber-optic strain sensors have\nbeen sensitive along their entire lengths and\nthus have yielded data on integrated or\naverage strains rather than on strains at\nspecific locations. Furthermore, prior fiberoptic strain sensors have not distinguished\nbetween axial and other strains.\nThe same principle can also be used\nwith a two-mode fiber. In this case, the\nsensitivity is equal to the difference of the\nphase shifts of the first and second mode:\n4 01 -4 11 . By making this difference\nequal to zero the fibers could be made\ninsensitive to strain.\nThis work was done by Claudio 0.\nEgalon of Analytical Services and Materials, Inc., and Robert S.

The apparatus is being developed to measure electric currents and/or magnetic fields in outer space as part of an effort\nto determine number densities and directions of movement of\nelectrically charged particles; a loop of low-loss optical fiber can be\nmade large enough that the number of charged particles encircled\nis adequate for measurement. The apparatus could also be used\non Earth in noncontact measurements of electric currents.\nThe apparatus would exploit the Faraday effect - the rotation of\npolarization of light as the light passes through matter along a\nmagnetic field. Polarized light would be launched into the optical\nfiber at one end, and the change of polarization caused by accumulation of the Faraday effect along the fiber would be measured\nat the other end. The magnetic field along the loop (and, equivalently, the electric current through the loop) could then be computed from the change in polarization. In comparison with a flux\nmagnetometer, this apparatus could, in principle, be more sensitive to magnetic fields. Another important advantage of this apparatus is that it would not produce a magnetic field, so that its effect on\nthe measured magnetic field or current should be minimal.\nIn addition to the fiber-optic loop, the apparatus would include\na stable source of coherent light and a high-resolution optical\nreceiver that could measure the change of polarization in terms of\na change of phase between orthogonal polarizations.\nA prototype of the apparatus was built to demonstrate feasibility. It included a laser diode as the source of coherent light, a\nfiber-optic loop of 75 turns and a diameter of about 1 m, and a\nhomodyne receiver that had phase resolution 1 to 2 orders of\nmagnitude better than previously reported in the literature. One\nimportant feature of the prototype was unique optics that produced three phase values 1200 apart simultaneously. Another important feature was a novel algorithm, implemented in hardware, that\ngenerated high-resolution phase measurements independent of\nthe intensities of signals. Tests of this apparatus revealed some\nundesired effects that involved stress-induced birefringence in the\nfiber and instabilities of the laser diode caused by optical feedback.\nApart from these effects, it appears that the proposed measurement technique would be practical, at least in the original intended\nouter-space application.\n\nIncrease your competitive edge with ESCO\nTypes: 900, 60\xc2\xb0, dove, cylindrical, trapezoidal\nbeam splitters, cubes, wedges,\nBrewster, Littrow.\nQuality: commercial to laser quality\nSizes: 5mmto100mm\nCustom: various materials and\nshapes\nCoatings: AR and reflective\nWrite or Call for Handbook\nCall Toll Free: 1-800-922-ESCO (Except NJ)\n\nESCO Precision Optics\nA Division of ESCO Products, Inc.\r\n171 Oak Ridge Road, Oak Ridge, New Jersey 07438 \r\n(201) 697-3700\t\nFAX: 201-697-3011\nFor More Information Write In No. 402\n\nThis work was done by Geert Wyntjes of OPTRA, Inc., for God-\n\ndard Space Flight Center.

This\ncan be regarded partly as a reversal of the\nprevious design procedure, in which one\nfirst specified the design of the resonator,\nthen computed the mode that it produced.\nHeretofore, only mirrors of circular cross\nsection have been used, and they have\noften been designed under paraxial-ray\nassumptions. Such mirrors produce optical aberrations, which can be large when\napertures are large. In the improved\nmethod, one proceeds directly to computation of the design for the desired mode.\nThere is no need to accept aberrations or\nsuboptimal circular shapes, to make iterative design computations in the effort to\nLASER TEH BRIYi\t\n\n(Lateral\t\nCoordinate)\t\n\nInitially Unspecified Mirror Surface\n(To Be Computed)\nI-\t\n\nY\t\n\nXr(Z,Z)_Xi(Z)\n\xc3\xb8(Z)\n\n01(Z)\n\n\t\n\n( Z )-y\' (z,Z)\n\nI\t\n\nInitially Specified\nMirrors Surface\n\n-\n\nj\n\n[x, (z ).y, (Z)]\n\nT1(Z)\nI"\t\n\nXr(ZZ)_Xi(Z)\n\nINTERNAL REFLECTIONS IN GENERAL CASE\n\nYr(Z,Z )-y1 (Z)\n\n(Longitudinal\nCoordinate)\n\nRay Tracing is used to compute the shape of the initially unspecified end mirror, given the\nshape of the initially specified end mirror and the specified output mode.\n\n46\t\n\nWIN] fR 1994\n\ny\nOutput )Partiafly\nReflective) En\nMirror\t\n\nSolid Resonator Material\n(Index of Refraction s\n\nTotally Reflective\nEnd Mirror\n\nIa\nEXAMPLE: A SELF-COLLLIMATING RESONATOR\n\nconverge on the desired mode, or to\nassume paraxiality of rays: Angles between\nrays and the optical axis can be large,\ncross sections of surfaces can be noncircular, and the computed shape of the end\nmirror is exact. Thus, the end mirror corrects for all aberrations.\nThe improved method is based on the\nwell-known principles of ray tracing: Rays\nof light are traced within the resonator\nbetween points of reflection on the end\nmirrors and as they are refracted through\none of the end mirrors (the partially reflective output mirror) into the exterior space\n(see figure). The desired output mode (e.g.,\ncollimated beam or rays emanating from\na single virtual point) is made to affect the\ndesign of the resonator by tracing the output rays back through the output mirror\ninto the resonator and imposing the applicable conditions on reflections at the two\nend mirrors.\nThe initially specified end mirror could\nbe either the output mirror or the other\none, and the longitudinal x and lateral y\ncoordinates of its surface are expressed\nparametrically in the form [x(z),y(z)I,\nwhere z is an arbitrary parameter. This\nspecification is combined with the applicable ray-tracing equations in such a way\nas to obtain a first-order, nonlinear differential equation for an integrated\nmagnification Z, which is a function of z\nand which appears in other parametric\nequations that satisfy the ray-tracing\nequations. The differential equation is\nintegrated numerically, and the resulting\nintegrated magnification Z(z) is inserted\nin the parametric equations, from which\nthe shape of the initially unspecified mirror surface is then computed. The resulting computed mirror surface can be fabricated by use of lithographic techniques.\nThe improved method is not limited to\nthe simple configurations shown in the figure.

The particular DIAL system, located at Mauna Loa,\nHawaii, is part of the international Network for\nthe Detection of stratospheric Change: as\nsuch, it is one of a number of DIAL systems to be used in long-term monitoring of\nstratospheric ozone.\nThe volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo\ngenerated stratospheric aerosols, which\nhave affected DIAL measurements since\n1991, preventing accurate determinations of\nconcentrations of ozone as functions of altitude. The Raman-augmentation technique\nused in this DIAL system provides return signals from Raman backscattering by nitrogen molecules only (not by aerosols): these\nsignals can be used to compute a correction for differential backscattering by\naerosols. (A further small correction for differential extinction by aerosols might still be\nneeded but is beyond the scope of the\ndevelopment reported here.)\nThe transmitter in this Raman-augmented DIAL system is a 100-W, low-divergence xenon chloride excimer laser, which\noperates at 308nm wavelength for backscattering by ozone. The reference wavelength\nof 353nm is generated in the transmitter by\nRaman scattering of part of the laser-beam\npower in hydrogen.

Conventional optical components like lenses and mirrors cannot refract\nand/or reflect hard x rays sufficiently to produce useful images.\nPinhole masks can produce x-ray images, but the resolution is typically much coarser than desired. The proposed Fourier telescope\nwould overcome the limitations of both conventional optical and\npinhole cameras.\nThe Fourier-transform grids would be made of tungsten or other\nhigh-atomic-number material 3 mm thick. The telescope structure\nwould be a truss 5 m long. The grids would be mounted at the ends\nof the truss in trays of graphite/epoxy or similar material that has a\nlow coefficient of thermal expansion. An aluminum shield 1 mm\nthick on the outer end of the telescope (facing the Sun) would\nblock soft-x-ray and lower-energy photons.\nThere would be a total of eight grids with two trays holding\nfour each; the slits and slats in two of the grids in a tray would be\nof one width (e.g. 0.0125 cm), while the sifts and slats in the other two\ngrids would be of a different width (e.g., 0.0275 cm).

These arrays offer significant increases in real performance over\ncurrent flat-plate, one-sun solar photovoltaic arrays. A prototype array that contains high-efficiency gallium arsenide cells\nhas been fabricated. This technology corresponds to a specific power density of\n250 W/m2 and a specific power output of\n80 W/kg. Through the use of new multijunction photovoltaic devices, the efficiency of the cells could be increased to\n30 percent; the corresponding performance figures would be 300 W/m 2 and\n100 W/kg. These values are approximately double those of one-sun arrays\nusing silicon cells.\nEach element of an array includes one\nphotovoltaic cell and one dome-shaped\nFr\xc3\xa7snel lens, the conical facets of which\nare designed to minimize reflective losses\n(see figure p.54). An optical transmission\nefficiency of 90 percent has been\nachieved; further design refinements could\nincrease the efficiency beyond 95 percent.\nThe slopes of the conical facets of the\ndomed concentrator are chosen so that\neach facet, acting in conjunction with the\nopposite smooth dome surface, refracts\nlight at the angle of minimum deviation;\ni.e., light enters the concentrator through\nthe dome surface and leaves the concentrator through the facet at the same\nangles of refraction with respect to both\nsurfaces. At any other combination of angles, reflective losses would be higher. In\ncomparison with photovoltaic arrays\nequipped with reflective or conventional\nfiat Fresnel lens concentrators, the minidome concentrator arrays are more than\n200 times as tolerant of slope errors; this\nfeature reduces sensitivity to thermal\nexpansion.\nThe Fresnel-lens concentrator focuses\nlight onto the photovoltaic cell at a sunlight concentration ratio of 50 to 100, depending upon the cell size chosen. A thin\nprismatic cover on the cell redirects the\nincident light away from the metal contacts on the surface of the cell toward\nthe bulk of the semiconductor, where it\nis absorbed. This eliminates reflective\nlosses from the contacts, which typically\nrange from 10 to 20 percent on an otherwise bare cell.\nThe mass of a domed-concentrator array with 30-percent-efficient cells could\nbe as little as half that of one-sun systems\nLASER TECH BRi1i\t\n\nwith comparable power output. In addition to the gains in performance, the cost\nof these refractive concentrator arrays\nshould be significantly lower. In a concentrator array, the amount of expensive photovoltaic cell material is reduced by a\nfactor of 50 to 100 and replaced by a relatively low cost concentrator lens. The\n\nsimple design of the mini-dome concentrator array is also easily adaptable to\nthe automated manufacturing techniques\ncurrently used by the semiconductor industry. These performance and cost advantages make the mini-dome Fresnel\nlens concentrator an attractive option for\na variety of future space missions.\n\n.\t\n\n..\n\nFOR E\nA HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLY\nTHAT MATCHES PERFECTLY.\nBertan is the world leader in detector\nhigh voltage power supplies and can meet\nvirtually every detector requirement, from\nlab to OEM.

An\ninfrared imager was aimed horizontally\ntoward a copper target plate, which was\nmounted on a rotation stage for precise\nangular positioning about a vertical axis. An\nelectrical heating pad was attached to the\nback side of the target plate. The front side\nof the target plate was coated with the\nspecimen material, which was a flat black\nlacquer in one set of measurements and a\nred epoxy in another set of measurements.\nOnce each target came to thermal equilibrium at each designated temperature, the\nrotation stage was used to orient the surface\nat various angles with respect to the optical axis of the infrared imager. At each angle,\nthe image-processing hardware and software of the imager were used to compute\nthe apparent absolute temperature of a\nsmall region of the target plate centered at\nthe intersection of the optical and rotation\naxes.

(The correlation peaks\nof matched stationary input images in the\nsame scene also increase by about the\nsame amount: this may be advantageous or disadvantageous, depending on\nthe specific application.)\nThe basic configuration of this correlator is that of a Vander Lugt optical correlator that includes a reflection grating\nformed holographically in a thick CdTe\nphotorefractive crystal. Both correlation\nand novelty filtering take place in the\ncrystal, but the principle of operation is\ndifferent from that of a simple combination of a novelty filter with an optical correlator. Instead, the novelty-filtering aspect\nof the principle of operation is based on\nthe dynamic-erasure property of the photorefractive crystal.\nThe source of light for the correlator is a\nneodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet\nlaser operating at a wavelength of 1.06\npm. The laser beam is split into reading,\nwriting, and reference plane-wave beams.\nAs shown schematically in the figure, the\nFourier transforms of the reference and\n\nInput Image\nSp\'\nMc\n\ninput images are spatially modulated onto\nthe writing and reading beams, respectively. The hologram is formed in the photorefractive crystal by interference between\nthis modulated writing beam and the reference plane-wave beam. The correlation\nimage is formed in the charge-coupleddevice camera when the hologram is\nread by the modulated reading beam.\nThe principle of operation as described\nthus far is that of an ordinary optical correlator. However, the modulated reading\nbeam containing the Fourier transform of\nthe input image partially erases the grating\nin the crystal produced by the modulated\nwriting beam and the reference planewave beam. This partial erasure reduces\nthe intensity of the correlation peaks when\nthe input image is stationary.\nHowever, when the input image moves,\nthe intersection of the Fourier transforms\nof the input and reference images also\nmoves. As a result, parts of the grating\nthat were not illuminated or were weakly\nilluminated by the reading beam become\nfully illuminated. These parts of the grating\nare stronger than the parts that were fully\nilluminated before, because these parts\nhave not been partially erased. Consequently, the correlation peaks obtained\nfrom these parts are stronger for a short\n\nLU:\n/\n\nWritingm\n\nCamera\n\nThis work was done by Duncan TsuenHsi Liu, Tien-Hsin Chao, and Li-Jon Cheng\nof Ca/tech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

It\nmay be desirable to suppress them in\nsome applications to discriminate against\nstationary clutter and thereby aid identification of moving objects.

The organic crystals in\nquestion have highly nonlinear optical\nproperties that are well suited for\n\nadvanced optoelectronic devices.\nUntil now, single-crystal organic materials have been grown from vapor or by\nthe Bridgman technique. In these techniques, crystals would suffer damage as\nthey solidified and came into contact\nwith the walls of containers. However, in\nthe Czochralski process, a growing crystal\n\nis lifted from the middle of the molten\nmaterial without touching the walls.\nBecause of the relatively low melting\ntemperatures of organic crystals, glass\nvessels can be used in this Czochralski\ngrowth apparatus.

Originally, these coats\nwere intended to protect the surfaces of\nradiators on spacecraft in low orbit\naround the Earth, where the impact of\natomic oxygen at orbital speed erodes\nthe coating material, thereby carrying\naway contaminants that have accumulated. On Earth, such coating materials\nmight be used to protest optical surfaces\nagainst damage during manufacture or\nto protect and facilitate the cleaning of\noptical surfaces that are particularly delicate or that cannot otherwise be cleaned\neasily.\nA typical clear, organic sacrificial coat\ncould be applied by conventional spraying\nor other techniques.

A box size in pixels is specified and\nthen used to construct the overlapping\nblocks for thresholding. The sizes of the\noverlapping blocks are twice those of\nthe boxes. The blocks are used to obtain the array of thresholds. For the\ninterior of the image, the location of a\npixel in a block is used to interpolate the\narray of the thresholds bilinearly and\narrive at the threshold value for that pixel.\nThe threshold value for a point on the\nexterior of the image is computed by\nuse of the value from the closest point in\nthe array of thresholds.\nTHRTOOL provides for a choice among\nfour methods of thresholding: In the first\nmethod, the average pixel value of each\nblock serves as an entry in the array of\nthresholds.

The test bed accommodates both passive and active\nmethods of control. The experimental\ncontrol system can reduce millimeterlevel disturbances in optical path length\nto nanometers. The equipment is being\ndeveloped for control, alignment, and\n\naiming of distributed optical systems on\nlarge flexible structures.\nThe test bed includes a tower 2.5\nmeters high with two horizontal arms\nextending at right angles from its top\n(see figure). It is rigidly mounted on a\nmassive steel block that provides a\nmeasure of isolation from ground\nvibrations. The block rests on three\nadjustable jackscrews to level the block\nand prevent it from rocking on an\nuneven floor.\n\nAn optical motion-compensation system similar to one described previously\nin NASA Tech Briefs is enclosed in a\nflexure-mounted frame, called the\n"trolley," at the end of the longer horizontal arm.

The trolley frame is made of a\nnickel/iron alloy with low thermal\n\nThe Trolley Is Mounted on One Arm on top of the tower. The shorter arm is available for such additional optical elements as a corner cube reflector. In use, the laser and the other components of the interferometer shown on the floor in the left photograph are placed on another tower to\ndirect light into the trolley, as in the right photograph. Inside the trolley are a variety of path-length-varying components.\nLASER 1i:ii Biui\t\n\n61\t\n\n\\X!NrER\n\n1994\n\nexpansion, with an aluminum\nconnection between mirrors to create a\nthermally stable separation between\nthem. The trolley is suspended from an\naluminum base by flexure elements that\ngive it a large measure of mechanical\nisolation from the rest of the test-bed\nstructure.

For another example, light from\na laser on the independent optical\nbench can be diverted to a corner cube\non the other arm of the structure before\nit enters the trolley. For even more\ndifficult experimental conditions, the\nstiffness of the trolley-mounting bracket\ncan be changed to bring the local\nvibrational modes of the trolleymounting bracket within the bandwidth\nof the control system.\nThe independent optical bench is a\ntower 2.7m high. It holds a heterodyne\nlaser interferometer that measures the\ntotal length of the optical path to a\nresolution of 2.5nm. To suppress\nvibrations, the tower is designed for\nstiffness, and it rests on an energyabsorbing pad. The residual motions of\nthe tower are small and well within the\ncontrol bandwidths, and thus are\ntreated merely as additional sources of\ndisturbance.\nAdditional sensors are available for\nmonitoring motions of the structure.\nAccelerometers can be placed almost\nanywhere on the trolley, structure, or\nlaser tower.

One\nbenefit of such technology is the remote\ncomputer-assisted operation of mining\nsystems for underground, highwalt and\nsurface mining applications.\nA cornerstone for computer-assisted\noperation is an effective guidance system.\nSince there are no guidance systems on\nany commercial continuous miners (CM\'s),\na team developed and tested a laserbased sensor system based on a commercially available laser scanning sensor.\nThe laser-based guidance system\nemploys four laser scanning sensors at\nfixed locations in a mine entryway to report\nthe angular coordinates of two cylindrical\nretroreflective targets mounted on a CM.\nThe laser scanner used in the system is\nthe LN-120/40001 Lasernet, developed\nby Namco Controls of Mentor, Ohio. It\nuses an eyesafe Class II 2.0mW HeNe\nlaser light source directed at a rotating mir-\n\nror. The targets are retroreflective tape\nattached to the 10-inch-diameter, 18-inchtall targets.\nA real-time microcomputer system\nuniquely addresses and requests data\nfrom each Lasernet sensor. The microcomputer converts the raw data to angular coordinates, performs error correction,\nand uses triangulation to process the sensor data and update the position and\nheading of the CM five times per second.\nUsing a simple control algorithm and communications interface to the CM actuation\ncomputer, the system also controls rotational and translational tram maneuvers.\nResearchers first took the laser system\nunderground in early 1991 and performed\nseveral experiments to determine system\nreliability and accuracy. Figure 1 shows\nthe experimental setup in an underground\nmine. The Lasernet sensors are housed\nin specially designed explosion-proof\nenclosures to eliminate any possibility of\ndust ignition. The enclosures and lasers\nare mounted on two poles located at fixed\npositions on both sides of an entryway.\n\nLaser Scanners\n\nRetroreflective Targets\n\nFigure 1. Conceptual drawing of Lasernet guidance system with targets on CM and\nLasernet sensors in entryway.\nLASER TECH BRIEFS\t\n\n63\t\n\nTwo cylindrical retroreflective targets are\nmounted on the tail end of the CM.\nThe most crucial factor in maintaining\nthe laser system\'s reliability underground\nis keeping the targets within the Lasernet\nsensor\'s field of view. The field of view is\nnot only dependent on the range of the\nsensor, but also on the targets\' vertical\nposition with respect to the laser\'s horizontal scan of light. As the CM traverses\nthe irregular mine floor, the scanning beam\nof the laser must continue to cross the target surface. By employing tall targets and\nfour Lasernet sensors at different heights,\nthe vertical tolerance was an acceptable\n0.76 meter. An alternative solution for\nunusually irregular floors would be to add\na mechanical mirrored assembly to the\nsensor which would sweep the beam vertically when no targets are detected.\nThe target detection range of the Lasernet sensor is an acceptable 10.67 meters.\nHowever, targets eventually become out\nof range as mining procedure progresses.\nThe CM is constantly removing coal and\nadvancing its position in the entry. Therefore a greater target detection range is\nmost desirable because it would reduce\nthe frequency at which the lasers would\nrequire advancement into the newly mined\nareas.\nThe data taken to determine the accuracy of the laser system in tracking position and heading and controlling the tram\nmaneuvers of the CM underground was\npromising. A laser transit was used to verify the system accuracy as the CM performed a variety of maneuvers underground. Tracking error is less than 2.5cm\nin position and 0.50 in heading. Tram control error is less than 10.2cm translation\nand less than 20 rotation.\nRelated underground experiments on\ncomputer-assisted mining systems used\nthe laser system to track and control the\ntramming of the CM. The laser system was\nan integral part of two experiments to test\nWINTER 1994\n\nthe first fully controlled, automatic execution of multiple sump-shear cutting cycles.\nThe first experiment used a preprogrammed coal removal script created and\nexecuted by the autonomous mining\nresearch and development system\n(AMREDS), a Windows-based computer\nprogram developed by the Bureau of\nMines and Carnegie Mellon University. The\nsecond experiment used Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity\'s MINENAV software to dynamically plan the maneuvers and appendage\n\ncommands necessary during a two-pass\nmining sequence. Details are omitted here\nfor brevity.\nResults of the underground experiments\nshow promise for application of this system in many mobile vehicle environments.\nThe system can accurately track any target-equipped vehicle within the target\ndetection range. For more mobile applications, the laser sensors can be mounted\non-board the vehicle, and multiple pairs\nof targets off-board. Additionally, the\n\nlaser/target configuration is adaptable for\ndifferent applications. The four-laser, twotarget configuration was found to be most\nreliable and accurate for the underground\nCM application. However, other configurations such as one-laser three-target were\nalso implemented and tested.\nThis work was done by Donna L. Anderson of the Bureau of Mines, Pittsburgh\nResearch Center.

From this optical measurement, the statistical distribution of the\nsizes of the powder particles is computed.\nThe powder-feeding apparatus provides\nthe steady flow that is neither too dense\nnor too sparse for creation of the required\ndiffraction patterns. Flow at too high a rate\nwould be too dense in that it would result\nin multiple scattering; the optical analyzer\nwould measure two or more particles at\nthe same time and indicate a smaller particle than was actually there. Flow at too\nlow a rate would be too sparse in that it\nwould yield insufficient data for computation\nof the particle-size distribution. Too sparse a\nflow would also expose the photodetector in\nthe optical analyzer to direct laser radiation\nin excess of its measurement range.\nIn the powder-feeding apparatus, the\npowder descends from a hopper through a\nseries of orifices, which meter the flow. The\nsubassembly that contains the hopper and\nmetering orifices is vibrated to prevent\nbridging of orifices and thereby ensure\nsteady flow at the maximum rate permitted\nby the orifices. After flowing through the\nlowest metering orifice, the powder stream\ncontinues downward through a flexible tube\ninto a vertical analyzer sight tube, where\nthe laser beam intercepts the stream monitored by the photodetector.

Monmouth, New Jersey\nThe standard low-loss optical fiber\ndrawing process involves a glass cylinder\npreform about a half-inch thick and just a\nfew feet long. The preform is then drawn\ninto an optical fiber of a single or a graded\nindex of refraction across its diameter. A\nnovel process uses a continuously moving\nfilamentary core on which are deposited\nlayers of glass precursor coatings. The\ncore material is either removed or\nbecomes an integral part of the optical\nfiber. The process can produce extremely\nlong lengths and does away with the\nbatch-type handling needed with preforms.\nIn the process, the organic core filament\nmoves past a number of stations. An early\nstation coats the filament with one or more\nshells of a glass-forming material known as\nsol-gel. After densification, the glass fiber\ngets a protective coating and is reeled out\non a storage reel. Thus the only limitations\non fiber length are the reel capacity and\nthe precursor core\'s length. Since the core\ncan be supplied from a continuously operating extrusion source, it can be of almost\nany length. This results in substantial cost\nreduction at the same time that it produces\na fiber with excellent optical quality and\nhigh mechanical strength.\nThe sol-gel process classically offered\ntwo approaches to making optical fibers.\nThe first involves the controlled hydrolysis\nof metal alkoxides, either for direct fiber\ndrawing of short lengths from solution, or\nfor casting porous preforms. The second\ninvolves the dispersion of colloidal particles, in either an aqueous or a nonaqueous solution. Both approaches are silicabased.\n\nStill another approach involves coating\na shell or concentric shells of sol-gel glass\non a fiber of graphite or plastic. The carbon host is sacrificed, and the glass shell\nis collapsed to a fiber. It is a three-step\nprocess. In the first, the fiber may be\ndipped repeatedly to build up a series of\nfilms that gel. The second step is drying of\nthe silica shell. The gel converts largely to\noxide, and a rigid continuous shell runs\nthe length of the fiber. At the same time the\nshell is shrinking in the radial dimension, it\nmust remain intact along the axis of the\nfiber. Repeated observation showed that\nthin films shrink perpendicular to the substrate and not in the plane of the substrate.\nThe third step is the complete collapse\nof the shell. It is possible to density the\nshell by controlled heating in oxidizing\natmospheres followed by vacuum treatment to pull out any remaining water vapor\nor gases. The ultimate temperature is\nbelow the softening temperature for the\nglass, and the fiber therefore does not\nneed support during firing. This eliminates\nsources of contamination and surface\nabrasion. Nevertheless the temperature is\nhigh enough to permit formation of highly\ndensified glass.\nThere is no inherent limitation in the solgel material that restricts its use in lightwave communications. The volatile-host\nmethod, in which volatilized carbon or\ngraphite core materials are ultimately\nremoved from the fiber, produces a fiber\nthat competes with commercial fibers produced by chemical vapor deposition.\nThe filament may also consist of a material that, rather than being removed from\n\nthe fiber, becomes an integral part of it.\nThus, a refractory oxide such as alumina,\nzfrconia or tantalum pentoxide can be used\nas the core. Additionally the filament can\nbe a material that chemically converts into\nan integral portion of the final fiber. These\ncores are halide-containing filaments such\nas ZrF4, AIF3, and KCI.\nAnother embodiment of the method can\nproduce fiber optic solid-state devices,\nlasers, or amplifiers through the introduction of compatible dopant ions into the\nsol-gel structure. For example the fiber\ncould be doped with erbium and vitrified\ninto an optical amplifier. A one-meter\nlength of such a fiber amplifier could, from\ncalculation, produce a gain of 30 dB at a\nfrequency of 10 GHz. Such a device has\nobvious application in undersea cables,\nreducing both the power required and the\nnumber of components in comparison with\nconventional electro-optical amplifiers; life\nand reliability should improve.\n\nThis work was done by Robert 0.

The apertures are\nused to define source and detector openings for measurements of images and\nscattered light in the visible, ultraviolet, and\nLASER TECH BRIEFS\t\n\nsoft x-ray wavelength regions, and as\ngeneral-purpose optical slits or slit arrays.\nThe rectangular microscopic apertures\ncan replace circular pinholes made by\npuncturing foils with needles, or more recently by drilling foils with intense, highly65\t\n\nfocused laser beams. The rectangular\nhole shape is important in raster-scan\nimage detection schemes where rectangular apertures provide more complete\nspatial sampling than circular apertures\ndo. Moreover, because the apertures are\nWINTER 1994\n\nmade of silicon, which is rigid and has a\nlow coefficient of thermal expansion, they\nare less affected by changes in temperature or pressure differentials than are foil\napertures. In addition, the smooth, polished\nsilicon surfaces reject uncollected light\nin a very predictable manner. In rasterscanning image dissection, the rectangular apertures in silicon can be used to\nachieve spatial resolution much finer than\nthat achievable with charge-coupled-device (CCD) arrays because the silicon\napertures can be made much smaller\nthan the CCD picture elements (pixels).\nThe starting material for fabrication of\nan aperture is a 1-0-0 crystalline silicon\nwater typically 300pm thick. By a series of\nphotolithographic, oxidation, and chemical\netching steps, a pyramidal or wedgeshaped hole is made in one side of the\nwafer. The wafer is eventually uniformly\netched from the other side until the bottom of the hole opens. The opening is\nrectangular (instead of rounded) because\nsilicon etches along preferential planes.\nEtching is continued until the opening at\nthe bottom of the hole has the desired\nsize. Of course, many such apertures can\nbe formed simultaneously in the same\nwafer.\nApertures as small as 1.4 by 1.7pm\nhave been made by this method. An array of about 100 such apertures would\nfit in the 20 x 20-pm area of a typical\nCCD pixel,\n\nThis work was done by Douglas B. Leviton, Murzy D.

A pyramidal hole is etched into the top side of the wafer.\nThe other side of the wafer is etched away until it is only 30 to 50pm away from the bottom of the hole. Bottom-side etching is then continued gradually to expose an aperture of\nthe required dimensions. Finally, the oxide protecting the top of the wafer and the pyramidal hole is etched away, leaving only silicon.\n\nImaging the Leading Edge of a Weld\nThe welding torch could be aligned better with the joint.\nMarshall Space Flight Center; Alabama\nA proposed optical system integrated\ninto a plasma arc welding torch would\nprovide an image of the leading edge of\nthe weld pool and the welding-arc-initiation point. Because a mass of molten\nmetal does not obscure the leading edge\nof a typical weld pool, the edges of the\nworkpieces to be welded together would\nbe clearly and continuously visible in the\nimage. A technician or robot could use\nthe image to keep the high-density arc\ncolumn centered on the joint, as is necessary to form a weld of high quality.\nThe system would include a coherent\nbundle of optical fibers and a transparent torch cup (see figure). One end of the\nfiber-optic cable would be aimed toward\nLASER TECH BRIEFS\n\nthe weld joint through a polished optical\nport on the cup. The bundle of optical f ibers would carry the image of the joint to\na video camera, video-signal processor,\nand monitor. A weld controller would use\nthe image to track the joint, control the\nfeed and location of filler wire, and provide geometric data on the weld bead for\nreal-time control of the welding process.\nThe proposed image-based control\nmethod offers important advantages over\nsuch current methods as through-theart sensing of parameters, identification\nof the surface of the base material, interpretation of eddy currents passed through\nthe base material, and physical contact\nfor control based on touch and feel.\n\n66\n\nThese methods can be inaccurate and\nunreliable and have caused expensive\nmistakes. Moreover, they require relatively\ncomplex, expensive, and obtrusive equipment, whereas the imaging technique\nwould entail the use of a low-profile\nbundle of optical fibers with commercially available video and data-processing equipment.\n\nThis work was done by William F.\nMcGee and Daniel J.

This mapping process,\ncalled "geocoding," is the first major\nstep in the overall registration process.\nIn geocoding and in the rest of the\nregistration process, one must understand how the perspectives and the\ncoordinate grid of each sensor and the\ngeometric distortion in the images that it\nproduces are affected by systematic\nand random errors in the assumed or\nmeasured positions and orientations of\nthe sensor. Other factors that must be\nconsidered include the different spatial\nresolutions of different sensors, the\navailability of tie points or other ancillary\n\nregistration data, and system noise.\nA candidate algorithm for fine registration of multisensor image data has\nbeen defined in terms of its overall functions (see Figure 1). The input data to be\nprocessed by this algorithm are required\nto be preliminarily geocoded according\nto the best available information, and the\npreliminarily geocoded data from all the\nsensors are required to be resampled at\nthe same pixel spacing. The signal-tonoise ratio of these data is required to\nexceed 5 dB. The geodetic accuracy of\nthese data is required to be better than\neither 500m or 50 pixels.\nThe first processing step of the\ncandidate algorithm would include the\nautomatic selection of subframes from\neach input image to define local areas of\nmultisensor coincident scanning where\nprecise registration could be performed\nFigure 1. The\nMultisensorRegistration\nAlgorithm provides for two\nalternative registration modes,\ndepending on\nwhether ancillary\ndata are available.\n\nInput Image Data\r\n(After Geometric Correction,\r\nGeocoding, and Resampling)\n\nAutomated\nSelection of Subimages\nAncillary Data\n\n____\n\n(Digital Elevation\nMaps)\t\nFine-Selection\nof Registration\n\nRegistration With\nAcillary Data\n\n]^_^\t L_\n\nI\n\nI\nConstraint Filtering \t\n\nExtraction of Features I\n\nMatching of Features\n\nConstraint Filtering\t\n\nI\n\nEstimate of Misregistration I\n\nLASER TECH BRIEFS\n\n\t\n\n68\n\n\t\nWINIER 1994\n\n\r\n\nsolution.

A Simulated Image of the terrain viewed by a sensor (in this case, synthetic-aperture radar) can be computed\nfrom the ancillary data (in this case, a digital elevation map), the viewing geometry,\nand a mathematical model of the physics\nof imaging (in this case, radar backscatter). In the proposed registration algorithm, the simulated and actual sensor\nimages would be matched by use of an\narea-correlation technique.\nwith high confidence of success.\nDepending on the availability of ancillary\ndata (for example, digital elevation maps\nderived from topographic maps or other\nsources), a registration mode would be\nselected. If a digital elevation map were\navailable, the multisensor data would be\ncoregistered to the common grid\nprovided by the digital elevation map\n(see Figure 2). If a digital elevation map\nwere not available, invariant features\nwould be extracted from the subimages\nby use of well-known digital imageprocessing techniques, and correspondence would be established\nacross the data to be registered.\nTo reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm and obtain several estimates of the misregistration per\nsubimage, features would be matched\nat multiple locations, and the results filtered to evaluate their relative spatial\nconsistency within the selected patch\n(this procedure is called \'constraint filtering"). If the match could be labeled as\nstatistically significant in the sense\nthat it satisfied some quantitative measure of goodness, the misregistration\nerror of the selected subimage would be\nestimated, and the multisensor data\nwould then be registered. Otherwise, the\nresult would be rejected, and the selection-and-matching process repeated\nwith different parameters.\nAt a higher level of processing, the\ncombined results from different features\nand from registered neighborhood\npatches could be used to produce a\nmore accurate and more reliable\n\t\nLASER TECH BRIEFS\n\nDRI\'\nCCD Systems for Real-time Raman Spectroscopy... \r\nPractical Solutions for Complex Requirements\nMultifaceted...\n\nCompact, modular and reliable\nwere the design criteria iucoqx>rated into our new\nRaman systems -\n\nat a surprisingly\nlow cost!

It\nsenses variations in the quantum-mechanical-tunneling current of electrons\nbetween the surface and a tungsten or\nplatinum electrode as the electrode is\nscanned across the surface in a raster\npattern. The tunneling current falls off\nsharply with distance and thus provides a\nmeasure of the roughness of the surface.\nAn atomic force microscope can be\nused to characterize an electrically insulating surface like that of a glass substrate. It includes a silicon nitride tip at the\nend of a cantilevered arm. Atomic forces\nI (Van der Waals or electrostatic) between\nthe tip and the surface deflect the arm to\nan extent that decreases sharply with distance. A topographical map of the surface\ncan thus be generated by measuring the\nI force on the arm as it scans a specimen.\nThe report describes representative\napplications of scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The\nreport notes that, while some mechanical profilometers can resolve surfaceheight variations over a spatial scale as\nsmall as 0.1 pm, scanning tunneling microscopes and atomic force microscopes\ncan resolve down to 1 nm.\n\nFor More Information Write In No. 613 \t\n\nExtraction of Emissivities\nFrom Thermal\nInfrared Spectra\nTwo techniques for\nprocessing multispectral data\nare compared.\nA report presents an evaluation of two\ntechniques for extracting information on\ninfrared emissivities from measurements\nWINIER 1994\n\nof radiance in six wavelength bands from\n8 to 12lJm. Emissivities in this wavelength\nregion vary with the chemical compositions and physical structures of minerals\nand thus could be useful in remote mineralogical mapping of the surface of the\nEarth. The problem in extracting emissivity data from measured spectral radiances is to separate the effects of temperature from the effects of emissivity.\nOne of the techniques for extraction\nof emissivity data is called "model emittance calculation." This technique is based\non the assumption that the emissivity of\nthe entire surface in the longest wavelength band is fixed at a value of 0.93.\nThe other technique for extraction of\nemissivity data is called "thermal log residuals." This technique is based on the\nWien radiation law, which is an approximation of Planck\'s radiation law. The\nequations show that this difference, called\nthe "thermal log residual," depends only\non a combination of emissivities; that is, it\nis independent of temperature.\nInfrared-image data for use in evaluating the two techniques for extracting\nemittance data were acquired by NASA\'s\nairborne Thermal Infrared Multispectral\nScanner (TIMS) over Cupnte, Nevada in\nwavelength bands of 8.83 to 9.47, 9.28 to\n10.24, 1011 to 11.20, and 10.88 to 11.65iJm.\nThe raw measured spectral radiances\nwere calibrated with respect to black\nbodies at known temperatures in the T1MS,\nand corrected for atmospheric effects.\nThe calibrated, corrected spectral radiances were then processed by use of\nthe two techniques.\nThe technique of thermal log residuals\nwas found to offer two advantages and\none disadvantage in comparison with the\ntechnique of model emittance calculation. The first advantage is apparent even\nwithout examination of specific data: the\nthermal log residuals yield emissivity data\nin all six wavelength bands, whereas the\nthermal emissivity calculation yields emissivity data in only five wavelength bands\n(because the emissivity in the longestwavelength band is assumed). The second advantage of thermal log residuals is\nthat noise in one wavelength band does\nnot affect the emittance data extracted\nfrom the other bands. In contradistinction, if the longest-wavelength band contains noise or if the assumed emissivity in\nthis band is incorrect in the model emittance calculation, then noise is introduced\ninto the emissivities in the other wavelength bands. The disadvantage of thermal log residuals is that the emissivity data\ncomputed by this technique cannot be\ncompared easily with emissivities measured in a laboratory, whereas the results\nof model emittance calculations can be\ncompared easily with laboratory data.\n\t\n\nThis work was done by Simon J.

The system is located\nin the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern\nCalifornia at an elevation of 2.3 km, where\nit has been operating since January, 1988.\nThe measurements taken by this system complement those taken by satellite-, rocket-, and balloon-borne instruments - in effect, serving as ground truth\nfor the data acquired by those instruments. The system is being refined in\niterative cycles of measurements, analysis of data, and modification of equipment. The accumulation of a substantial\ndata base in continuing operation should\nlead to the capability for sensitive detection of trends in the concentration of\nozone and for early warning of changes\nin the stratosphere.\nThe basic principle of operation is that\nof differential-absorption lidar. Laser pulses\nare generated at two wavelengths and\ntransmitted simultaneously along the same\napproximately vertical path into the atmosphere. The wavelengths are chosen\nso that electromagnetic radiation at one\nof the wavelengths (in this case, 308nm)\nis absorbed strongly by the chemical\nspecies of interest (in this case, ozone)\nwhile the absorption by the species of\ninterest at the other wavelength (in this\ncase 353nm) is much weaker.\nThis work was done by I.
