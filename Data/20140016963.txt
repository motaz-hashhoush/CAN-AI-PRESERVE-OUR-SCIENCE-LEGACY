As such, the T2 has\nbeen added to the Noise Hazard Inventory, and hearing protection has\nbecome mandatory when the treadmill is used above 10 mph per the\nNoise Constraint Flight Rule. An\nacoustic MCTB has been designed\nwith a material layup specifically designed to absorb the sound generated by the T2 treadmill. After serving\ntheir primary purpose of carrying logistics, the MCTBs will be reconfigured to flat panels and attached in a\ndual layer to two walls in proximity to\nthe treadmill. Modelling data shows\nthat this implementation could decrease the sound level by 2-3 dBA.\nNote that since dBA is measured on a\nlogarithmic scale, a 3 dBA reduction is\na halving of the sound energy.\n\nThe Logistics Reduction (LR) project within the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES)\nprogram is tasked with reducing logistical mass and repurposing logistical items.\nMultipurpose Cargo Transfer Bags (MCTB) have been designed such that they can\nserve the same purpose as a Cargo Transfer Bag, the suitcase-shaped common logistics carrying bag for Shuttle and the International Space Station. After use as a\ncargo carrier, a regular CTB becomes trash, whereas the MCTB can be unzipped, unsnapped, and unfolded to be reused. Reuse ideas that have been investigated include partitions, crew quarters, solar radiation storm shelters, acoustic blankets, and\nforward osmosis water processing.\n\nINNOVATION PERSPECTIVE\nThe MCTB project can greatly reduce the amount of trash for Exploration missions.\nPARTNERSHIPS/HIGHLIGHTS\nThe MCTB team has worked with the Acoustic Office to determine the optimal material layup of an acoustic MCTB to absorb the sound of the ISS T2 treadmill. In addition, team has collaborated with the RadWorks Storm Shelter team at NASA-Langley\nto infuse their storm shelter designs with MCTBs.\nINFUSION POTENTIAL\nThis technology may be used on any vehicles including ISS, Orion, and future deep\nspace vehicles to repurpose logistics items, reduce overall logistics mass and volume,\nand reduce trash.\n\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nPM: EC/James Broyan, 281-483-9351 james.l.broyan@nasa.gov\nTask Lead: EC/Shelley Baccus, 281-244-0907 shelley.baccus-1@nasa.gov\n\nTRL:4\n\n'
