b'Ten years ago, we could only\nput our imagination to work here.\nIn 1981, America cheered the first hft-\n\noff of the Space Shutde. And on that day, space was\nchanged forever. It\'s no longer the boundary of\nEarth, it\'s an extension. It\'s become our work space.\nSince the arrival of the Space Shutde,\nhuman beings can explore and study and achieve\nin person as well as in spirit.\nWe\'ve seen satellite deployments,\nretrievals and repairs, bio-medical experiments,\nspacewalks-all from a spectacular perspective.\nSoon, we\'ll even see astronauts assembling the first\nspace station. And the Shutde will take them there.\nCongratulations, NASA, on the tenth\nanniversary of the Space Shuttle program. Martin\nMarietta is proud to be part of your team and its\nextraordinary mission-to put space to work for all\nof us here on Earth.\nTo us, there\'s only one bottom line.\nMission success.\nIt4ARTIN It4ARIETTA\n6801 ROCKLEDGE DRIVE, BETHESDA, MARYLAND 20817\n\n___\n\n5 ~===::=~:\n~==::=-5 ~;:=:\xc2\xb7;-~r \'\'\'\'\'-~===-=- Rm\nc\n\nThe\n\nA\n\nCase for\nP-Method\nAnalysis\n\nEngineers have long thought that\ncomplex meshes produce more\naccurate results.\nHowever, with recent technology\nadvances, the P-Method of using\nhigher-order polynomials to describe the deflection of elements\noffers a simpler solution.\nNow Structural Research makes\nP-Method analysis available to complement the HIP-Method and adaptive meshing analysis techniques for\nwhich COSMOS/M is famous.\nUsing the COSMOS/M P-Method,\n\ns\n\nE\n\nB\n\no o\n\nfar fewer elements are required to\nachieve convergence and accurate\nresults. The P-Method also offers\nsignificant advantages in ease of\nuse, and CPU speed to reach a\ndesign solution.\nUsed with the COSMOS/M STAR\nmodule, the P-Method can be combined with adaptive meshing to\ndetermine nodal displacements and\nelement stresses. Even coarse\nmeshes developed in CAD programs can be used with COSMOS/M\nto yield accurate solutions by simply\nincreasing the value of P for the\nelement.\nTo appreciate the speed and simplicity of the COSMOS!M P-Method,\nstudy the chart below.

Mur iel D. Ross\n\nO\n\nne of the more interesting debates of the present day centers\non whether human intelligence\ncan be simulated by computers. Some\nargue that there is something unique,\neven mystical, about the human mind,\nand therefore intelligent behavior cannot be duplicated by machines. Others\ndisagree on the premise that brains are\nsimply collections of neurons and can\nbe understood in physical and mathematical terms, perhaps not soon, but\nin the foreseeable future.\nAt the NASA-Ames Biocomputation\nCenter, we work under the premise that\nneurons individually are not smart at all.\nRather, they are physical units which\nare impinged upon continuously by other\nmatter that influences the direction of\nvoltage shifts across their membranes.\nSome influences are in the direction of\ndepolarization (excitation) while others\nare in the direction of hyperpolarization\n(inhibition) . It is only through the actions of a great many neurons - billions in the case\nof the human nervous system - that intelligent beI\nhavior emerges.\nN\nUnderstanding even the\nsimplest neural system reN\nquires painstaking analysis of the architecture and\nV\nphysiology of its parts. Our\nA\ngoals should be to gain inT\nsight into those features\nthat are fundamental to all\nneural networks and then\nR\nto develop the algorithms\nS\nthat define the responses.\nThis effort will result in new\napplications of biological\nsystem attributes to artificial systems\nand in advances in computer design.\nThe research requires the interaction of\nneurobiologists, neurophysiologists,\nphysicists, modelers, mathematicians,\n\no\n\no\n\n10\n\nPhoto counesy Ames Research Center\n\nDr. Muriel Ross heads a research team studying the 3D makeup of a biological\nneural network to uncover the basic principles of neural organization and\nfunctioning. Such research could lead to the development of highly-intelligent\nparallel-processing computers.\nand theoreticians; in short, a formidable\narray of specialists. It also requires the\ndevelopment of highly-specialized computertechnologies. We have assembled\na team at NASA-Ames to promote the\ntechnology needed to understand the\nneurobiology, both in its own right and\nas a guide to future computer advances.\nWe also are working on the physical\nand mathematical interpretations essential to the development of a silicon\nchip for potential inclusion in robots.\nThe biological neural networks we\nstudy - the vestibular maculas of the\ninner ear - are among the simplest of\nthe mammalian neural networks to understand and model. At the same time,\nthey are complex enough to be useful\nfor deriving principles of neural network\norganization. Because the basic structure of vestibular maculas does not differ between species, we have used the\nrat utricular macula as a model system.\nMacular end organs act as linear\nbioaccelerometers. They consist of a\ntest mass suspended in a gel-like liquid\nabove a detecting unit. The test mass\nfeatures tiny crystallite particles called\n\notoconia which are unevenly distributed above the detector. The detecting\nunit is a neural network structured for\nweighted, parallel distributed processing of information. It contains two types\nof hair cells, a system of nerve endings\nwith branches and collaterals, and small\nnerve fibers that end on type II hair cells\nand on other neural elements within the\nmacula.\nThe hair cells function as detectors.\nAt their apical surfaces, they bear a tuft\nof thread-like sensors known as\nstereocilia and a special sensory hair\ncalled the kinocilium . The tufts are always organized in hexagonal arrays,\nbut the size and height of the individual\nstereocilia vary from site to site. Ordinarily, the stereocilia are in staircased\norder, with the tallest bordering the\nkinocilium , which is attached to the\notoconial layer. Since the kinocilium is\ncapable of motility, we believe it agitates this layer. Translational linear\nacceleratory force affects the otoconia\ndifferently according to their individual\nmasses and the background of activity\nalready occurring . The result is that\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\ncomplex waves are constantly emitted,\nwith or without the addition of transient\naccelerations, and the detecting units\nrespond according to their stereociliary\nconfigurations.\nFourier analysis of various tuft organizations shows that the stereociliary\ntufts are highly-directionally-tuned by\ntheir hexagonal organization and height.\nIn another astonishing correlation to\nhuman-engineered devices, it seems\nthat nature invented the equivalent of a\nsensitive phased array antenna millions\nof years ago. Analysis of the repeating\nlattice angles of stereociliary tufts shows\nthat they range between 1150 and 1250 \xe2\x80\xa2\nThe optimum repeating lattice angle\nfor man-made antennas is a 1200\nrhombus.\nThese and other findings mean that\nwe are well on our way towards understanding - and expressing in mathematical and engineering terms - the\nbasis of detection of incoming linear\nacceleratory signals by this biological\nsystem. We also are improving our understanding of the neural network organization by using computer technology\nto reconstruct parts of the network and\nto produce symbolic models that mimic\ntheirfunctioning. This research currently\nis tedious and labor-intensive, requiring\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\nphotographing serial sections in a transmission electron microscope; reassembling the micrographs into montages of the section; tracing objects of\ninterest from the montages; digitizing\nthe tracings into a computer; and\nreassembling the tracings into shaded\nimages. In the Biocomputation Center,\nwe are developing two image processing systems to eliminate the photography and to make digitization more rapid\nand accurate. The first system captures, enhances, and digitizes electron\nmicroscope images directly, then stores\nthem on an optical disk. The second\nsystem assembles the digitized images\nas montages and aligns them to a common coordinate system. A user interacts with the computer to produce files\nof contour data from which 3D models\nare generated.\nUsing current reconstruction techniques, we have demonstrated the\nsmallest functional units of the network, its receptive fields, which consist of the calyceal endings of a nerve\nfiber together with the hair cells that\nsynapse with them. We also have\nreconstructed parts of the neural\nnetwork. Our basic findings are that no\ntwo of the receptive fields are identical\nand that the network varies in com-\n\nCircle Reader Action No. 638\n\nplexity from site to site.\nThe key question is can we reduce\nthe network\'s complexities to meaningful engineering and mathematical expressions that capture, uncompromisingly, the architectural and functional\nfoundations of the system without simply reproducing it. For if we are to improve artificial computer technologies\nand produce thinking machines, we must\naccomplish this without replicating the\nbillions of neurons and their connectivities present in a human brain.\nWe must reduce brain organization to\nits basics and build from there. Perhaps\nin some ways the artificial brains can be\nmade to outstrip the biological!\nAs part of this effort, we have produced a dynamic, symbolic model of a\nsmall portion of the neural network.

The quasi-optical\nresonator (see figure) incorporates a folded Fabry-Perot interferometer of high 0\nand high finesse, another folded FabryPerot interferometer of lower 0 and low\nfinesse, and a Littrow-mounted diffraction\ngrating. (0, a measure of the sharpness\nof the resonant spectral peaks, is defined\nas 211" times the electromagnetic energy\nstored in the resonator divided by the electromagnetic energy dissipated in the resonator during one cycle of oscillation.\nFinesse is defined as 0 divided by the\nnumber of wavelengths along the roundtrip reflection path.)\nThe electromagnetic beam from the\noscillator is coupled into the resonator\nquasi-optically; e.g., via a feed horn. At an\nangle of incidence of 45\xc2\xb0, the beam first\nstrikes metal mesh 1, which seNes as one\nof the partially reflecting surfaces of the\nhigh-O folded Fabry-Perot interferometer.\nThe other partially reflecting surface is\nmesh 2. The reflectivity and spacing of the\nmeshes are designed to obtain the desired\ncomb-pattern transmission spectrum.\nThose parts of the spectrum of the incoming beam that are not within the narrow\npeaks of this transmission spectrum are\nreflected by mesh 1 to absorber 1.\nThe portion of the beam that passes\nthrough the high-Q Fabry-Perot interferometer is filtered similarly in the low-O\n\nRefocusing\nM irror\n\nAbsorber 3\n\nC/V\\JV\\/\\}\nTo and\nFrom\nOscillator\n\nMovable\nM irror\n\n\\\n\nThe Quasi-Optical\nMillimeter-Wavelength Resonator\nexploits diffraction\nand rellection effects\nto achieve high Q .\nThis type of resonator is useful mainly at\nwavelengths too\nshort for conventional wavegu ide\ntechniques but too\nlong for optical techniques.\n\nlow\xc2\xb7Q\nFabry\xc2\xb7Perot\nInterferometer\n\nFabry-Perot interferometer. The characteristics of meshes 3 and 4 and the other\nparameters of this interferometer are chosen\nso that its transmission spectrum includes\nat most half the peaks of the transmission\nspectrum of the high-O interferometer. The\nrest of the spectrum incident upon mesh\n3 is reflected to absorber 2.\nThe diffraction grating reflects the\ndesired part of the beam back along itself\ntoward the source and performs the final\nspectral filtering . The Littrow mounting is\nchosen to effect the desired back-reflection. The mounting angle, period, and other\nparameters of the grating are chosen so\nthat only one of the spectral peaks that\nremain after the second grating is reflected\nback toward the source. The rest of the\nspectrum incident upon the grating is\nreflected onto absorber 3.\nThe prototype resonator was designed,\nfabricated, and tested at a frequency of\n\n63 GHz. It exhibited a 0 of 6,600 and a\nround-trip loss of 2.52 dB. With attention\nto some details (e.g., nonuniform illumination, ohmic loss, and spillover loss) that\nwere not considered in the design of the\nprototype. it should be possible to achieve\nO\'s as high as 10,000. The design can be\nscaled easily to frequencies as high as 1\nTHz.\nThis work was done by Margaret A.;\nFrerking and Karen A. Lee of Caltech for\'\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Together with recent advances\nin the quality factors (O\'s; that is, reciprocals of damping factors) of microwave resonators, the new oscillator concept could\nresult in phase noise less than that achievable by cryogenically stabilized microwave\ncomponents or by room-temperature oscillators stabilized by quartz crystals.\nThe new oscillator concept could be implemented in three different versions (see\nfigure). The first version would be based\npartly on the established stabilized-Iocaloscillator concept. However, one way in\nwhich it would differ is that the signal from\nthe resonator cavity would be returned\nfrom the input port of the cavity instead\nof from a second coupling port. A circulator would separate this signal from the\nforward driving signal. The returned signal\nwould be fed to a phase detector in the\nform of a mixer. At critical coupling and\non resonance, the returned signal would\nbe identically zero. However, it would be\nthe superposition of two nearly equal signals, one of which would emanate from\n20\n\nthe cavity and the other of which would\nbe the reflection of the driving signal from\nthe resonator port. At resonance, this reflected signal would not significantly affect\nthe operation of the mixer because it\nwould be in quadrature with the signal at\nthe other mixer port. While the ampli!tude\nwould go through zero on resonance, there\nwould be a reversal of phase in which the\nin-phase signal on one side would become\nout of phase on the other, providing a linear\ndependence of the output voltage of the\nmixer on the frequency error, as required\nfor effective feedback. Unlike in prior stabilized local oscillators, the returned signal\nwould be amplified on its way to the mixer. Thus, the effective mixer phase noise\nwould be reduced by the factor of amplifier\ngain. Degradation of the signal by phase\nfluctuations in the amplifier is prevented\nby carrier suppression due to the superimposed signals_Thus amplifier phase noise\nwould also be reduced, with the amount\nof reduction given by the degree of carrier suppression.\nThe second version would resemble the\nfirst version somewhat, but the phase sensitivity would not be enhanced by amplification of the signal returned from the res-\n\nonator. Instead, it would be enhanced by\nuse of relatively high power in the high-O\nresonator. The suppression of the carrier\nat the r port would make it possible to increase power supplied to the resonator\nwithout saturating the mixer.\nThe third version would be configured\nas a reflection oscillator with direct radiofrequency feedback. As in the first version,\nthe Signal returned from the resonator\nwould consist of two superposed signals\nthat would cancel at resonance if the\ncoupling to the resonator were critical.\nHowever, here, the resonator would be\nslightly over-coupled, so that at resonance,\nthe return signal would have a small, constant value. This condition can be shown\ntheoretically to result in a reduction of the\nphase fluctuations by a factor that would\nincrease with the gain of the amplifier.\nBecause the path lengths of the circuit\ncould give rise to large phase shifts that\ncould cause oscillation at spurious frequencies, a band-pass filter would be incorporated to suppress such oscillations.\nThis work was done by G. John Dick\nand Jon Saunders of Caltech for NASA\'s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

(The round\nfeed horn must be replaced because it is\ncoupled to a waveguide that cannot reliably handle power in excess of 400 kW.)\nThe feed horn includes a power combiner section and a flare section (see Figure 1). The power from the four amplifiers\nis fed in through four input waveguides\n0.95 in. (24.1 mm) square, which allow\nelectromagnetic energy to propagate only in the two orthogonally polarized TE10\nmodes at the design frequency of 8.51\nGHz. By appropriately selecting the relative phases of the signals from the four\namplifiers, one can cause the combinedpower beam to have either of the two\nlinear polarizations or either of the two circular polarizations.\n\nThe fou r input waveguides merge into\nan output waveguide 2.06 in.

(152 mm) to cause the\nTE30 and TEas modes to decay at least 30\ndB before they reach the beginning of the\nfirst flare.\nThe radiation pattern of the new feed\nhorn is required to have minimal spillover\nloss (minimal side lobes) and to have a\nmain lobe as much as possible like that\nof the present corrugated circular feed\n\nhorn (see Figure 2). The main lobe must\nilluminate the subreflector, which subtends\nthe solid angle within a 160 half C9ne angle\nof the main antenna axis. The desired radiation pattern can be obtained by coupling some of the power from the TE l0 mode\nto the TE30, TE 12, and TM 12 modes.

When used with appropriate software, the circuit converts the\nprinter port on an IBM PC, XT, AT. or compatible personal comouter to a general\n\npurpose,8-bit-data, 16-bit address bus that\ncan be connected to a multitude of devices.\nThe previous methods of connection included direct connection to the internal\nbus of the PC, use of an RS232 serial or\nother standard interface circuit, and modification of the printer port to provide the\ncapability for bidirectional transmission of\n\nremember when you had the power to\ncreate immediate aerospace simulations,\nvary conditions and specify outputs\nduring interactive execution?\nMGA\'s Advanced Continuous Simulation language (ACSl) is the software\nthat gives you the power to simulate complex, non-linear systems,\nfoster, with better results.\n\n8-bit data. Each of the these methods of\nconnection has disadvantages. For example, a direct connection to the internal bus\nrequires a special circuit card that occupies a card slot in the PC. With an RS232\nserial interface, the rate of transfer of data\nis slow. Other methods are specialized,\ncomplex, and require additional cards or\nmodification of equipment.\nBecause the printer port on the IBM PC\nwas designed especially for the transmission of data to a printer, the PPI must be\nable to hold an address as well as to provide for the flow of data in both directions.\nTo transmit to the external device, the PC\nprinter port sends the address, data, and\ncontrol values to the PPI one byte at a time.\nAs the PPI receives this information, the\nPPI latches it on the proper output lines.\nOnce the address and data are latched,\nthe external device is Signaled to accept\nthe values. Before the PC reads from the\nexternal device, it first sends the address\nand control signals to the PPI. The external\ndevice then responds with eight bits of data\non the input lines. Since the printer port has\nonly five inputs, the PPI transfers the eight\nbits of data to the PC four bits at a time.\nThe PPI has both reading and writir19\nmodes of operation. The PPI is very simple,\nrequiring only six integrated circuits. It provides for moderately fast rates of transfer\nof data and uses an existing unmodified circuit card in the IBM PC. The output of the\nPPI has the characteristics of a conventional bus, with address, data, and control\nsignals. This "bus" can be easily connected to most peripheral integrated circuits.\n.\nThis work was done by Jerry H. Tucker\nand Ann B. Yadlowsky of Langley Research Center.

One of the bridge\nresistors is a solitary conductive line, while\nalongside each of the other four bridge\nresistors is another conductive line, nominally of the same width and electrically\nisolated. To test the effects of design width\nand/or spacing, the bridge resistors can\nhave equal or different design widths, and\nthe distances to the isolated side lines can\nbe equal or different.\nEach Van der\xc2\xb7Pauw cross provides for\nmeasurement of the sheet resistance,\nwhich is used along with the measured\nlengths and resistances of the bridge resistors to compute the widths of the lines. By\nplaCing Van der-Pauw crosses at both\nends, one can obtain two values of the\nsheet resistance, which should be equal\nbut which, if not equal, can be used to ac\xc2\xb7\ncount for some of the spatial variation in\nthe sheet resistances of the bridge\nresistors.\nThe data from the measurements on\nthe five bridges can be used to determine\nthe four parameters of a mathematical\nmodel that describes the system.

Like other oscillators stabilized by\nsuperconducting cavities, this one operates with a degree of stability, at short\nmeasuring times, superior to that achievable by any other means. The principal differences between this oscillator and the\nothers of this type are that a" of its components are designed for cryogenic operation and the stabilizing cavity is very rigid,\nconsisting of a sapphire filling coated with\nlead. The cavity has a Q (ratio of electromagnetic energy stored to electromagnetic energy dissipated in one cycle. a\nmeasure of the sharpness of resonance)\nof about 109 .\nThe oscillator assembly has been described in previous reports. It includes the\nstabilizing cavity, a coupling cavity, and an\nultra-low-noise cryogenic ruby maser,\nwhich supplies the excitation. The ruby\nmaser operates at a frequency of 13.1\nGHz, creating an energy-level-population\ninversion that supports oscillation at 2.69\nGHz. Splits of the energy levels are matched\nto changes in the resonant frequency of\nthe stabilizing cavity by means of a bias\nmagnetic field from a superconducting\nsolenoid. The frequencies of the three\nmodes of the coupled-cavity system are\nwithin about 5 percent of each other close enough for effective coupling, but far\nenough apart to enable the selection of\na mode by adjustment of the bias field.\nA continuous\xc2\xb7flow liquid-helium cryostat keeps the oscillator at a nearly constant low temperature. The frequency of\noscillation varies with temperature and is\nmaximum at about 1.57 K. Consequently,\nthe oscillator can be operated at or near\nthis temperature to obtain zero linear coefficient of variation of frequency with\ntemperature. The measurements were\nperformed at 1.58 K regulated to within\n. \xc2\xb140 I-\'K.\nThe performance of the oscillator was\nmeasured during times ranging from 1 to\n104 s. The frequency was found to be\nstable to within a few parts in 1015. The\nstability during a measuring time of 1 s\nwas found to be 10 times as great as that\nof a hydrogen maser. The phase noise was\nfound to be about - 80 dB/f3, where f\ndenotes the deviation, in hertz, from the\ncarrier frequency. This level is more than\n20 dB below the phase noise of the best\nsignals of comparable frequency derived\nfrom multiplication of the frequencies of\nquartz oscillators.\nThis work was done by G.

The reference signal\ncould be, for example, a frequency\xc2\xb7stand\xc2\xb7\nard signal for use in radio-science experi\xc2\xb7\nments, and the transmission medium\nwould typically be air or an optical fiber\nthat connects the reference-signal\'generating station with a receiving station.\nThe proposed two-carrier transmission\nscheme would enable the receiving sta\xc2\xb7\ntion to compensate for the propagation\ndelay and for changes in the propagation\ndelay (caused, for example, by fluctuations\nin temperature) in the transmission medium. Thus, a "cleaned\xc2\xb7 up" phase- and fre\xc2\xb7\nquencY\'stabilized signal that represents\nthe reference frequency and phase more\naccurately would be made available at the\nreceiver. It is noteworthy that the proposed\nscheme would require only one-way trans\xc2\xb7\n\nmission, whereas prior stabilization schemes\nhave involved two-way transmission. The\nproposed scheme is, therefore, simpler in\nprinciple and is expected to be more en\xc2\xb7\nergy- and cost-efficient. It should also enable the use of longer transmission paths.\nThe reference radio signal would be\nused to modulate the two optical carriers,\nwhich would be transmitted along the\nsame optical fiber or path in free space\n(see figure). At the receiver, a dichroic\nbeam splitter would separate the light into its two wavelength components. A photodetector would demodulate each component, producing two versions of the\nradio-frequency modulation corrupted by\npropagation along the optical-fiber or freespace transmission path .\n\nPII...\nShiflet\n\nReflfenee Radio Slgn.1\n(TyplC411 Frequency)\n\nFI BER-OPTlC VERSION\n\n100 MHz)\n\nL...-_---J\nReference RadIO\n(Typical\n\n100 MHz\n\n~gnal\n\nFrequency\n\nFAE\xc2\xa3SPACE VERSION\n\n100 MHz)\n\nThe Radio-Frequency Reference Signal would be used to modulate two optical carriers at the\ntransmitter. Dispersion in the optical-fiber or free-space transmission medium, usually regarded\nas a nuisance, would be used to advantage in the receiver to measure and compensate for phase\nand frequency fluctuations induced by fluctuations in propagation conditions.\n\nThe difference between the times of arrival of the radio-frequency modulation on\nthe two optical carrier signals would depend on the optical\xc2\xb7dispersion character\xc2\xb7\nistics of the transmission medium and\nwould be proportional to the length of the\npath. This difference would manifest itself\nas a difference between the phases of the\ntwo detected modulation signals and\ncould, therefore, be measured by comparing the signals in a mixer. The output of\nthe mixer would be used to control a phase\nshifter in the path of one of the detected\nmodulation signals. The phase shifter\nwould thus compensate for the propaga\xc2\xb7\n\ntion-induced phase and frequency fluctuations, yielding the desired phase- and frequency-stabiliZed output signal.\n\nThis work was done by l.J.Jtfollah Maleki\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The intermediate-frequency signal is digitized to 8 bits and sampled (typically, at a rate of 4 samples per intermediate-frequency cycle).\nThe proposed system is intended for\nuse with an incoming signal that contains\na residual carrier. The overall receiving system would lock in phase to the residual\ncarrier and thereby generate an in-phase\nand a quadrature reference signal, Which\nwould be fed to all channels_Within each\nreceiver front end, the digitized signal samples would be mixed with the reference\nsignals and low-pass-filtered to remove\nhigher-order mixer products. Further lowpass and narrow-band filtering separates\nthese baseband outputs into slowly varying (nominally, dc) carrier-phase components and rapidly varying modulation\ncomponents.\nThe signal-combining system consists of\ntwo main parts: the combiner subsystem\nand the parameter estimator (see Figure\n2). The full baseband outputs of the receiver front ends are sent to the combiner\nsubsystem, which multiplies them by complex-number optimum estimated weights\nand sums them to produce the combined\noutput. The slowly varying carrier-phase\ncomponents of the outputs of the receiver\nfront ends are fed to the parameter estimator, which computes the optimum\nweights via an algorithm based on maximum-likelihood estimates of the underlying signals and noise.

The Addressing Scheme for\nwriting to and reading from the dual-port\nrandom-access memory is a repeating sequence. The addresses of the memory\nsegments are put in gray code instead of\nnormal binary sequence because this\nprevents the input and output processors\nfrom incorrectly perceiving asynchronous\nchanges in the reading and writing addresses, respectively.\n\neach of which can hold one of the secondformat bursts, which are called "transfer\nframes."\nOperation begins when the input processor detects an Incoming (first-format)\nframe of data. The input processor so notifies the buffer memory by sending it a\ntransfer-frame header. The input processor\nthen repeatedly encapsulates the incoming first-format frames into packets of data\nof the second format and packs the second-format packets into the transfer frame\nthat is being assembled in the buffer memory. When this transfer frame has been\nfilled, the input processor notifies the output processor that this transfer frame is\navailable. In turn, the output processor\nnotifies the sink of data that this transfer\nframe is available. Meanwhile, the input\nprocessor begins to pack a new transfer\nframe into the buffer memory, and this\nprocessor continues as long as the firstformat data continue to come in (provided that there is still room in the buffer\nmemory).\nWhen the sink signals a request for a\ntransfer frame, the output processor\nresponds by transferring that frame immediately from the buffer memory to the\n\nsink and indicating to the input processor\nthat the portion of the buffer that stored\nthat transfer frame is now available to hold\na new transfer frame.\nThe input processor sends, to the output processor, the number (address) of the\nsegment of random-access memory into\nwhich it is writing data. Similarly, the output processor tells the input processor the\naddress of the segment from which it is\nreading data. Both processors step through\nthe segments of the memory in the same\nprescribed, repeating sequence (see Figure 2). To prevent overflow, the writing address must not be allowed to get so far\nahead of the reading address that it catches\nup with the reading address from behind\nin the repeating sequence. To prevent underflow, the reading address must not be\nallowed to catch up with the writing address. The output processor determines\nhow many transfer frames are available\nfor output by noting how far the writing address is ahead of the reading address.\nThis work was done by Glen F.

Inasmuch\nas the MDPSK symbol rate would be\nRbI n, it is reasonable, from a perspective\nof equal bandwidths, to compare the expected performance of this system with\n~-Ievel DPSK\nthat of an uncoded M\nsystem that has the identical input bit rate.\nAt the receiver, the noise-corrupted signal would be differentially detected, and\nthe resulting symbols would be fed to the\ntrellis decoder, which \'NOU1d be implemented as a Viterbi algorithm. In the selection\nof a decoding metric, there is a tradeoff\nbetween Simplicity of implementation and\nthe optimality associated with the degree\nto which the metric matches the statistics\nof the output of the differential detector.\nFor uncoded MDPSK, a metric based on\nminimization of the distance between the\nreceived and transmitted signal vectors is\noptimum in the sense of a minlmum-probability-of-error test. For conventional trelliscoded MDPSK, the metric takes on the\nform of a minimum-squared-Euclidean-distance metric. For multiple-symbol detection of multiple-trellis-coded MDPSK, the\nform of the metric Is quite different, but this\nmetric can be converted once again into\na minimum-squared-Euclidean-distance\nmetric by a modification of the multiple\ntrellis code. The so-called "equivalent"\nmultiple trellis code that results from this\nmodification then becomes the principal\nconcept used In analyzing the performance of the overall system.\nFigure 2 illustrates the computed per-\n\n=\n\n=\n\n\\\'J\\J\\~\n\nCASES FOR\nENSITIVE ELECTRONICS\n,\n\nII-\n\nPrevents lid separation from base\non impact.\n\nPrOllide controlled shock and\nvibretion levels.

NP0-18043\n\nDiplex Fiber-Optic Link for Frequency and Time Signals\nRelatively inexpensive equipment delivers signals of high quality.\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nReference frequency and time signals\nare transmitted Simultaneously from a central Signal-processing station along a\n10-km fiber-optic link to a remote station.\nThe diplex fiber-optic link is part of the\nGoldstone Deep Space Communications\ncomplex; similar links may be useful in\ntelevision, communication, and electriCpower-distribution networks and other applications in which signals at different locations must be synchronized precisely.\nThe fiber-optic link consists mostly of\ncommercial equipment, some of which is\nmodified slightly; because of this, its cost\nis relatively low. At the central station, a\nsignal combiner adds the 5-MHz reference-frequency signal and the 3&bit timecode signal, forming a composite Signal,\nwhich modulates the light transmitted\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\nalong the optical fiber. At the remote station, the fiber-optic receiver detects the\ncomposite signal and provides the input\nto a diplexer, which separates the frequency reference signal from the time-code\nsignal. The signals are then amplified to\nthe desired levels. Despite the relatively\nlow cost of the fiber-optic equipment, the\nstability of its output reference-frequency\nsignal is greater than that of a prior cesium\nfrequency standard.\nThe figure illustrates the operation of the\nsystem in more detail. The S\'-MHz reference-frequency signal is fed to the com\xc2\xb7\nbiner through an isolation amplifier: this\nprevents the time-code signals from feed\xc2\xb7\ning back into the reference-frequency\nsource, where they would give rise to cross\nmodulation between the two signals. The\n\ntime code signal is fed to the combiner\nthrough a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 kHz. The signal combiner is\nof the resistive type to minimize intermodulation distortion (the amount of intermodulation distortion produced by a transformer-type combiner would be excessive\nin this application).\nIn the fiber-optic transmitter, the optical\ncarrier emitted by a laser diode is amplitude-modulated with pulses at a subcarrier frequency of 24 MHz. The output of\nthe signal combiner is used to frequencymodulate the subcarrier. The optical Signal\nmodulated by the frequency-modulated\nsubcarrier is transmitted along the optical\nfiber. In the receiver at the remote station,\na photodiode detector recovers the frequency-modulated subcarrier from the op39\n\ntical signal, and a frequency discriminator\nrecovers the modulation.\nTo recover the separate time-code and\nreference-frequency signals, the output of\nthe receiver is fed to a two-branch demultiplexer. In one branch, a low-pass active filter extracts the time-code signal. In\nthe other branch, the signal is amplified\nand passed through a high-pass filter with\na cutoff frequency of 100 kHz to obtain a\n"dirty" version of the 5-MHz signal that is\npartially contaminated with the time code.\nThe time-code contamination is removed,\nand the noise bandwidth is reduced by a\ncleanup loop filter, which consists of a\nquartz frequency-standard oscillator\nlocked in phase to the "dirty" 5-MHz\nsignal.\nThis INOrk was done by George F.

NPO-18180\n\nBurst-Compression and -Expansion for TDMA Communication\nVariable-data-rate users are interconnected via a satellite-switched network.\nLewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA burst-compression and -expansion\ntechnique enables the interconnection of\nusers transmitting and receiving data at\nrates asynchronous with respect to clocks\nwithin the ground terminals of a satelliteswitched, time-division-multiple-access\n(TDMA) communication network. In such\na network, a matrix switch aboard the satellite routes bursts of data from source\nusers received on uplink antennas to\ndownlink antennas that illuminate ground\nareas containing destination users. Each\nburst is timed so that while it lasts, only\none pair of source and destination users\nis communicating; and during the burst,\nthe full receiving , switching, and transmitting resources of the satellite are allocated\nto that pair. These resources are divided\nor time-division-multiplexed among all active users in the network. Greater flexibility in interconnecting widely dispersed\nusers is achieved by use of hopping\nbeams. Multiple uplink and downlink antenna beams are electronically switched\nto cover specific source and destination\nlocations simultaneously in a periodic sequence. Source and destination users in\ncovered locations communicate with each\nother through TDMA ground terminals (see\nFigure 1).\nAt each source terminal, lower-rate, continuous digital data streams from multiple\nusers are compressed into high-rate bursts\nfor modulation and transmission in the\nassigned time slots within the TDMA frame\n(see Figure 2). Serial data from each source\nuser are temporarily converted to a parallel\nformat and stored in one of several compression buffers. At the assigned time,\nparallel data are read out of the com pres-\n\n40\n\nsion buffer onto the multiplexed-data bus,\nscrambled, converted to a high-rate, serial\ndata format, modulated, and transmitted\nas a burst. Bursts received by the destination terminal are demodulated, converted\nback to a parallel format, descrambled,\nand expanded back into continuous data\nstreams at the original lower data rates\nand delivered to the destination users.\nTo support multiple users with a wide\nrange of asynchronous data rates, the\nnumber of bits of user data transmitted by\nthe source terminal from frame to frame\nmust vary. At the destination terminal, the\nregenerated bit clock delivered to the user\nmust replicate the frequency and stability\nof the source user. The key feature of the\ntechnique is to group the number of lowerrate user data bits received by the source\nterminal over roughly one frame period into\nan equivalent number of higher-bit-rate\nvalid data words each frame and thereby\n"quantize" the frame-te-frame variation in\nthe number of valid data bits per frame into\none-word increments. This grouping of\nuser data into words is performed by the\ncompression buffer; continuous user data\nare written into the first-in, first-out (FIFO)\nmemory at the user\'s clock rate and are\nread out at the burst modulator clock rate.\nEach transmitted burst is an integer number of words in duration. On a frame-teframe basis, the number of valid words in\nthe burst may increase or decrease by one\nfrom some nominal number that represents the approximate data throughput.\nIn the destination terminal , a control\nloop subroutine executing in the user interface controller varies the frequency of\na voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The\n\nVCO is used to generate both the read\nclock for the expansion buffer and the data\nsynchronized bit clock delivered to the\ndestination user. The control loop adjusts\nthe regenerated clock frequency based on\nthe fill level of the expansion buffer observed at the end of each frame.\nThrough the use of nominal and valid\ndata-word counts, FIFO memories, adjustments to the duration of transmit and receive frames, and microprocessor-controlled regeneration of clock signals, the\nvariable-rate-compression-and-expansionbuffer technique preserves bit integrity and\nminimizes overhead and latency for lowto-medium-data-rate users who are not\ntraditionally served by TDMA networks.\nThe technique enables the use of inexpensive clock sources by both the users and\nthe ground terminals and obviates the\nneed for elaborate user-clock-synchronization processes. The technique accommodates a continuous range of data rates\nfrom kilobits per second to that approaching the modulator burst rate (hundreds of\nmegabits per second).\nThis technique was developed for use\nin NASA Lewis Research Center\'s satellite\nnetwork simulation facility. Some key features of the technique have also been implemented in the ground terminals developed at NASA Lewis for use in on-orbit\nevaluation of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite high-burst-rate\nsystem.\nThis INOrk was done by James M.\nBudinger of Lewis Research Center.

The particular symmetry is such\nthat the reflections from the second pair\nof mirrors cancel the lateral displacement\ncaused by the reflections from the first pair\nof mirrors (see figure). Thus, the output\nbeam leaves the four-mirror monochromator along an axis coincident with that\nof the input beam. This preservation of the\naxis of the beam is critical in some synchrotron beam lines and free-electron\nlasers.\nThe input filter and the first two mirrors\n\nHou.lng\n\nPolychromalle\nInput Beam\n\nInput FoU Filter\n(Removes Visible\nand LonQWavelength\nUltraviolet Ught)\n\nMonochromatic;:\nOutput Beam\n\n~mm~~~~~~~\n\nMultilayer Coat\n\nLock1ng\n\n~---- Selacrew\n\nThe Four-Mirror X-Ray and Extreme-Ultraviolet Monochromator contains two identical pairs\nof mirrors like the.pair in the compact x-ray and extreme-ultraviolet monochromator. The two pairs\nare placed "back-to-back" to return the output beam to the path of the input beam and to obtain\nadditional spectral selectivity.\n\nconstitute a compact monochromator like\nthe one described previously, and, therefore, the laterally displaced intermediate\nbeam has a narrow spectrum. This spectrum is narrowed further by the reflections\nfrom the mirrors of the second pair. Thus,\none of the principal advantages of the fourmirror monochromator is additional spectral selectivity, achieved at a modest increase in cost and complexity and with\nsome loss of throughput.\nAs in the compact monochromator, one\ncan change the wavelength of peak transmission by putting other mirror substrates\nthat have different Bragg-reflecting multilayer coats in the mirror mounts. Ordinarily,\n\nthe multilayer coats on all four mirrors are\nidentical. However, one could obtain even\nbetter spectral resolution (at the cost of\nSignificant loss of throughput) by use of\nmultilayers that have Bragg-reflection bandpass spectra slightly offset from each\nother.\nThis work was done by Richard B.\nHoover of Marshall Space Right Center.\nFor further information, Circle 151 on the\nTSP Request Card.\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed to the Patent Counsel, Marshall\nSpace Flight Center[see page 14}.Refer\nto MFS-28498.\n\n~~ Compact X-Ray and Extreme-Ultraviolet Monochromator\nThis low-cost monochromator can operate at selected wavelengths in a wide spectral range_\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama\nA monochromator for x-ray and extremeultraviolet radiation provides higher spectral resolution than can be achieved with\nthin-metal-foil broad-band-pass filters. It operates over a much broader x-ray and extreme-ultraviolet spectrum than devices\nbased upon natural crystals do, and in\ncomparison with a typical grating monochromator, it is smaller and less expensive.\nThe new monochromator is intended to\nfilter the continuum radiation from sources\nlike synchrotrons, laser plasma sources,\n44\n\nfree-electron lasers, and wigglers to produce monochromatic beams for testing\nand analysis of x-ray and extreme-ultraviolet telescopes and microscopes, for\ncalibration of photographic films and detectors, for biological and biomedical research, for x-ray lithography, for processing of materials, and for research in the\nproperties of materials.\nAs shown schematically in the figure,\nthe monochromator includes a pair of mir\xc2\xb7\nror substrates with identical reflecting mul-\n\ntilayer coats. These mirrors are mounted in a housing of stainless steel or\nlow-thermal-expansion alloy on surfaces\nmachined and lapped precisely to keep the\nmirrors parallel to each other. The radiation enters the monochromator housing\nthrough a prefilter that filters out visible and\nlonger-wavelength ultraviolet light.\nThe mirror substrates - made of sapphire or low-thermal-expansion glass/ceramic composite - must be superpolished to a roughness of less than 3 A root\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\nMultilayer\n\nmean square. The reflecting coat on each\nsubstrate consists of many alternating\nlayers of high-atomic-number x-ray-diffracting material separated by layers of lowatomic-number spacing material. AJllayers\nare uniform and of accurately repeatable\nthicknesses throoghout the multilayer ~ck.\nEach multilayer coat constitutes a synthetic Bragg crystal, which reflects x rays\nby Bragg diffraction. The wavelength at\nwhich the peak of the reflected flux occurs is given by the Bragg relation NA\n20 sin 8, where N is the order of the diffraction (usually 1); 0 is Ihe effective thickness of a high-atomic-numbernow-atomicnumber pair of layers, corrected for the\neffect of refraction; and 8 is the angle between the incident beam of radiation and\nthe surface of the mirror. The reflection\nfrom both mirrors occurs at angle 8, and\nthe reflection from the second mirror narrows the spectrum that remains after the\nreflection from the first mirror.\nBy the choice of 0, 8, and the materials\nin the layers of the multilayer coats, the\nmonochromator can be made to operate\nat a desired wavelength in the soft-x-ray\nor extreme-ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. AIl additional pair\nof multilayer reflectors (not shown) could\nbe used to enhance the spectral resolution of the monochromator and to cancel\nthe lateral displacement of the beam; such\ndisplacement would be unacceptable in\n\nWay\n\nThe Compact Multilayer X-Ray and extreme-Ultraviolet\nMo n o chr o mator\nuses Bragg reflection\nto band-pass-filter the\nradiation from a highintensity, broad-spectrum source.\n\nCoal\n\nWay\nMounllng\n\nfling.\n\n=\n\nlocking\nSetscrew\n\nMounting\n\nLocking\n\nRange\n\nSetscrew\n\nsome synchrotron-beam-line or free-electron-laser applications.\nThe mirrors are nominally tilted at an\nangle of 45\xc2\xb0 with respect to the incident\nbeam. but different angles can be chosen\nfor selected wavelengths.

The calibration technique\nhelps to assure Earth scientists of the accuracy of satellite radiometric measurements taken during a long time. The optical\ntrain of the orbiting radiometer is degraded slowly and the sensitivities of detectors\nand gains of amplifiers are changed slowly in the outer-space environment, but frequent calibrations by the airborne-radiometer techniqJe make it ~bIe to CCXTpenSCrte\nfor these changes.\nIn concept (though not in implementation) the calibration technique is simple.\nThe airborne and spaceborne radiometers\nsimultaneously monitor the same target\narea on the Earth during clear weather.\nThe target is preferably bright and relatively\nuniform. The aircraft measurements are\nmade from as high an altitude as pos$ible along the same viewing vector as that\nof the satellite (see figure), so that the airborne and spaceborne radiometers measure nearly identical spectra, including the\neffects of the atmosphere. The radiances\nmeasured by the airborne radiometer are\ncorrected for what little part of the atmosphere lies above the aircraft. The spaceborne radiometer is then calibrated by c0mparing its measurements with the corrected\nmeasurements taken by the presumablyaccurate airborne radiometer.\nIn the experiment, a radiometer was\nflown aboard a U\xc2\xb72 airplane at an altitude\nof 19.8 km to calibrate the visible a.o.Q nearinfrared spectral band of the Visible-inTrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) aboard\nthe Geostationary Orbiting Environmental\nSatellite 6 (GOES-6), which produces images of an entire hemisphere once each\nhour in three spectral bands to provide\n\nSun\n\nThe Same Area of\nthe Earth is viewed\nalong the same direction by a spaceborne\nand an airborne radiometer.\n\nnearly global observations of clouds, water\nvapor, and temperatures. White Sands,\nNew Mexico, was selected as the target\narea for several reasons: It has the required brightness and near uniformity; the\nprobability of a clear sky there is great; the\ncharacteristics of the atmosphere there\nhave been well documented for years; the\nreflectance of the surface is diffuse and\nnearly Lambertian, and, consequently, any\nerrors that arise from slight differences between the fields of view of the airborne and\nspaceborne radiometers are minimal; and\nthe radiance of this area lies in the higher\ndynamic range of the spaceborne radiometer. The airborne and spaceborne radiometric measurements were supplemented\nwith surface meteorological data, including\nhorizontal visibility and soil mOisture, and\nwith other meteorological data.\nThe satellite and aircraft measurements\nwere processed and compared to obtain\ncalibration coefficients. The results showed\nthat the radiances measured by the air-\n\nborne radiometer were of the order of 14\npercent greater than those measured with\nthe spaceborne radiometer, using its original calibration . Assuming that the spaceborne radiometer was calibrated correctly before launch, this means that it had lost\nsome sensitivity in orbit, as one might expect.\nThis vvork was done by Gilbert R. Smith,\nRobert H. levin, Robert S. Koyanagi, and\nRobert C. Wrigley of Ames Research\nCenter.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nTwo kinds of gas-flow reaction chambers expose specimens of materials to\nspatially even fluxes of monatomic oxygen.\nIn radio-frequency plasma ashers and\nother reaction chambers used previously to test reactions of materials with\nmonatomic oxygen, experiments have\nbeen complicated by uneven fluxes of\nmonatomic oxygen and by undesired\nfluxes of electrons, ions, and ultraviolet\n48\n\nradiation.\nThe first type of chamber is part of a\nflowing-afterglow apparatus. A gas that\ncontains oxygen flows through a radiofrequency discharge, in which monatomic\noxygen is produced. The gas cools to near\nroom temperature as it flows from the\ndischarge. Specimens are mounted at the\nouter ends of side-arm tubes attached to\nthe flOWing-afterglow apparatus at a suita-\n\nble location downstream of the discharge\n(see Figure 1).\nThe oxygen atoms enter the side-arm\ntubes and diffuse to the specimens at the\nouter ends. The dimensions of the side-arm\ntubes and the total pressure in the flowingafterglow gas are selected so that the\ncharacteristic time for the diffusion of\nmonatomic oxygen across a side-arm tube\nis much less than the characteristic time\nfor recombination of monatomic oxygen\ninto diatomic oxygen. This selection assures that the flux of monatomic oxygen is\ndistributed evenly across each side arm\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\nand across the specimen at the end of\neach side arm.\nIn the second kind of charOOer, monatomic oxygen is generated by laser-pulse\nphotolysis. In the version illustrated in Figure 2, the ultraviolet (or, in some cases, infrared) output of an excimer laser is focused into a beam of rectangular cross\nsection. Specimen sheets are placed near\nand parallel to (but not touching) the beam.\nThe gas (which could contain 02\' 03\' No2\'\n\nNp. or other suitable precursor molecules) flows through the chamber.\n/!>s in the side-arm approach. the oxygen\natoms reach the surfaces of the specimens only by diffusion. In this case. the\ndose received by each specimen is proportional to the number of oxygen atoms generated in the photolysis volume between\nthe specimens. The flux of atomic oxygen\nis distributed evenly across each specimen as long as the monatomic oxygen is\n\nFigure 1.

The principal application of this technique will likely be in\nexperiments in which oxygen plasmas are\nused to examine the degradation of various\nmaterials by monatomic oxygen.\nIn the catalytic\'probe technique, one\nmeasures the flux density of oxygen atoms\nindirectly by measuring some of the heat\ngenerated by the recombination of oxygen\natoms into oxygen molecules on a catalytic probe surface. The improved version of\nthe technique involves two similar probes,\none of which is catalytic, the other of which\nis not. Both probes (see figure) include\nglass tubes that contain type-K thermocouples sealed in epoxy near the measuring tips. A thick-film heating resistor on a\nceramic base is also sealed into the epoxy\nnear the thermocouple in the noncatalytic\nprobe. The other probe does not contain\na resistor, but its outer surface is coated\nwith silver, which quickly oxidizes and becomes a catalyst for the recombination of\nmonatomic oxygen. The emissivity of the\nsilver oxide is 0.85 - the same as that\nof the glass.\nThe probes are mounted near each\nother in the plasma chamber and operated\nsimultaneously so that both sample nearly the identical atmosphere and its atomicoxygen content. (One of the weaknesses\nof prior versions of the technique is that\nthey involved single probes and sequential measurements in which identical con\xc2\xb7\n\nType-K\n\nThermocouple\n\nThe CatalytiC Probe\nand the Noncatalytic Probe measure\nthe rate of heating\ncaused by the recombination of monatomic oxygen on the\ncatalytic surface.

The temperature measured by the thermocouple\nin the catalytic probe includes the effect\nof heat released by recombination of oxygen. The electrical power delivered to the\nresistor in the noncatalytic probe is measured and automatically adjusted by con\xc2\xb7\ntrol Circuitry that attempts to keep the temperature in the noncatalytic prOOe the same\nas that in the catalytic probe. Under this\ncondition, the electrical heating power is\nnearly proportional to the rate of recombination and, therefore, to the flux density\nof monatomic oxygen. The noncatalytic\nprobe can also be operated without heating to measure the temperature of the\nprobed atmosphere.\nThe total flux of oxygen atoms that strike\nthe probe is computed from the known\nenergy released in each recombination\n\n(5.2 eV) and the empirically determined\nproportionality between the heating power\nand the increase in temperature above\nambient. The flux density is then found by\ndividing the total flux by the area of the\ncatalytic surface. If the probed atmosphere\nis thermal, then the number density of oxygen atoms can be computed from the flux\ndensity and the temperature.\nThis work was done by M. R. Carruth,\nJr. , R. F. OeHaye, J.

Each lens would focus light\nfrom a small rectangular area of the passing ground-surface scene onto the plane\nthat contains its detector. The sensors\nwould be positioned so that the axes of the\ncylindrical lenses would be parallel to each\nother and perpendicular to the direction of\nmotion.\nAs the vehicle moved, the sensors would\nfollow the same path over the surface, one\nafter the other. Thus, the two photodetectors would generate similar signals as they\npass one after the other over the same surface features, but one Signal would be delayed with respect to the other by an interval inversely proportional to the speed.\nA processor would compute a correlation\nbetween the two signals to determine the\ndelay between them. The distance between\nthe sensors would then be divided by this\ndelay to determine the speed. The distance\nbetween the sensors and the focal length\nof the cylindrical lenses could be chosen\nto optimize performance for the anticipated\n\ni\n\n~\n\n\'0\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n~.6tt-\n\n:\n\nTIme\n\nI\n\n\'"\ng\n~\n\n\'0\n\n~\n\n\'5\n0\n\nI\n\n~\n\nspeed range.\nThe source of light used to illuminate the\narea viewed by the sensors could be continuous or pulsed.

This field makes the ions undergo the desired hyperfine transition from\nthe 2S112 (F 0, mF O) state to the 2S112\n(F 1. m F 0) state. The ions then scatter ultraviolet light until the lamp pumps\nthem back into the nonscattering 2S 112\n(F 0, mF 0) state.\nThe intensity of the fluorescence (scattering) is measured while the frequency of\nthe applied magnetic field is varied about\na fixed nominal value in increments of 0.2\nHz. This yields a resonance peak that, in\n\nthe initial measurements, was found to be\nabout 1.6 Hz wide. The short-term frequency stability of the apparatus was found to\nbe better than twice that of the best commercial cesium frequency standards.\nCurrently, a new frequency standard is\nbeing developed.

The particular apparatus is one of four that were\nbeing developed when the report was presented in May 1987, and other, commercial units may be available shortly.\nThe use of trapped Hg + ions as a frequency standard was first proposed more\nthan 20 years ago. The standard frequency - in this case, about 40,507,347,997\nHz - is defined in terms of the photon\nenergy of the hyperfine transition between\ntwo atomic ground states of the 199Hg +\nion. The ions are confined in a radio-frequency electric quadrupole trap, in which\nthey are subjected to very small perturbations of their atomic energy levels and to\nweak forces that equalize the populations\nof the ground-state hyperfine energy levels.\nPotentially, the largest source of fluctuations in the frequency is the second-order\nDoppler effect of the motions of the ions\nin the trap. To minimize this effect, heavy\nions like Hg +, which move more slowly\nthan do other ions at the same temperature, are preferred for trapped-ion frequency standards.\nThe hyperfine transition of interest is\n2S 112 (F 0, mF 0)_2S112 (F 1, mF =\n0). The 199Hg + ions are first created in\nthe trap by bombarding a neutral 199Hg\nvapor with a pulse of electrons that lasts\n112 second. During this bombardment and\nfor about 1/4 second afterward. the ions\nare irradiated with photons of wavelength\n194.2 nm from a 2l2Hg discharge lamp to\nexcite the transition 2S112 (F 1. mF)2p1f2\' The 2p 112 state decays rapidly (with\na lifetime of 2 ns) to either the 2S 112 (F =\n0, mF O) state or the 2S 112 (F 1. mF)\nstate, thereby scattering a 194-nm photon.\nSince the transition 2S 112 (F 0, m F\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\nMaterials\nHardware, Techni ques,\nand Processes\n\n56 Optimum Platinum loading\nin P 5n02 CO-Oxidizing\nCatalysts\n\n. ~ Optimum Platinum Loading in\nPtlSn02 CO-Oxidizing Catalysts\nCatalytic activity peak8 at about 17 weight percent Pt.\n\nLang/ey Research Center, Hampton, Virginia\nPlatinum on tin oxide (PtJSn02) is a good\ncatalyst for the oxidation of carbon monoxide at or near room temperature. Tests at\nNA8A Langley Research Center have\nshown that the activity of this catalyst can\nbe maximized by optimizing the platinum\nloading of the catalyst. PtlSn02 is available\ncommercially at loadings of about 0.5 to\n2.0 percent platinum (per total weight of\ncatalyst), whereas catalysts with platinum\nloadings as high as 46 percent have been\nfabricated by a technique developed at\nLangley Research Center. Work was conducted to determine optimum platinum\nloading for this type of catalyst.\nA PtJSn02 catalyst that contained 17 percent platinum converted a stoichiometric\n\nmixture of 1.00 percent CO and 0.50 percent 02 to CO 2 with a yield 3.7 times as\ngreat as that of a commercial catalyst that\ncontained 2 percent platinum. Tests of PtI\n8n02 catalysts with various Pt loadings revealed the following (see figure): (1) The activity of the catalyst increased with Pt load\xc2\xb7\ning until a peak was reached at 17 percent\nPt. (2) The activity of the catalyst exhibited\na trough at 24 percent Pt. (3) The activity\nof the catalyst then increased with further\nPt loading until a second, lower peak was\nreached at 39 percent Pt. (4) The activity\nof the catalyst then declined with higher\nPt loading, becoming very low at 100 percent Pt.\nThe obseNed behavior may represent\n\ntwo similar but somewhat different mechanisms. The common feature of both\nmechanisms is the oxidation of CO chemisorbed on Pt by OH groups on 8n02. This\npostulate requires Significant concentrations of both Pt and 8n02 for maximum efficiency, and, therefore, both very low and\nvery high Pt loadings exhibit low activity.\nAt Pt loadings below 24 percent, the major source of the oxidant species, OH, is\nH20 , which is contained predominantly in\nthe 8n0 2 phase. This is shown by the fact\nthat high-temperature pretreatment of PtI\n8n0 2 catalysts with Pt loadings below 24\npercent invariably causes an initial dip in\nactivity, which dip can be readily eliminated\nsimply by exposure of the catalysts to H20 .\nHowever, catalysts with Pt loadings above\n24 percent do not exhibit an initial dip in\nactivity when heated and, therefore, do not\nappear to be as sensitive to dehydration\nas those with lower Pt loadings are. This\nindicates that they may have an alternative\nsource of OH.\nWith high Pt loadings, sufficient hydrogen may be stored in the Pt phase to furnish OH by reaction with oxygen from the\n8n0 2 phase. Therefore, the presence of\nH20 is not essential at such loadings.\nThus, above about 24 percent Pt, the major source of OH is believed to be hydrogen\nstored in the Pt phase combined with oxygen from the 8n02.\nIn some applications, a 39-percent Pt\nloading (which gives the lower peak in activity) may be preferable because this higher Pt loading should not require humidification, as does the 17-percent loading (which\ngives the higher peak in activity). Generally, the optimum platinum loading for the oxidation of CO, as derived from this study,\nis believed to be about 15 to 20 percent.\nA major application would be the removal\nof unwanted CO and 02 in CO2 lasers.\nThis \'NOrk was done by David R.

Until recently, efforts to utilize\nsmall computer systems for display and\nanalysis of scientific data have been hampered by the lack of sufficient data-storage\ncapacity to accommodate large arrays of\nimage data. Most images of planets, for\nexample, require nearly a megabyte of\nstorage per image. The recent development of the "CD-ROM" (Compact Disk\nRead-Only Memory) storage technology\nmakes possible the storage of up to 680\nmegabytes of data on a single 4.72-in.\n(12.Q-cm) disk.\nIMOISP was developed for use with the\nCD-ROM storage system that is being\nevaluated by the Planetary Data System.\nThe latest disks to be produced by the\nPlanetary Data System are a set of 8 disks\ncontaining 16,000 images of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus acquired by the Voyager\nspacecraft. The images are in both compressed and uncompressed formats. IMNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\nDlSP can read the uncompressed images\ndirectly, but special software is provided\nto decompress the compressed images,\nwhich cannot be processed directly. IMDISP can also display images stored on\nfloppy or hard disks.\nA digital image is a picture converted\nto numerical form so that it can be stored\nand used in a computer. The image is divided into a matrix of small regions called\npicture elements, or pixels. The rows and\ncolumns of pixels are called "lines" and\n"samples," respectively. Each pixel has a\nnumerical value, or ON (data number) value,\n\nthat quantifies the darkness or brightness\nof the image at that spot. In tot31, each pixel has an address (line number, sample\nnumber) and a ON value, which :.ue all that\nthe computer needs for processing.\nDISPLAY commands enable the IMDISP\nuser to display all or part of an image at\nvarious poSitions on the display screen.\nThe user can also zoom in and out from\na point on the image defined by the cursor and can pan around the image. To enable more or all of the original image to\nbe displayed on the screen at once, the\nimage can be "subsampled." For example, if the image were subsampled by a\nfactor of 2, every other pixel from every\nother line would be displayed, starting from\nthe upper left corner of the image. Any\npositive integer can be used for subsampiing.\nThe user can produce, from an image\nfile, a histogram that shows the number\nof pixels per ON value, or per range of ON\nvalues, for the entire image. IMDISP can\nalso plot the ON value versus the number\nof pixels along a line between two points\non the image. The user can "stretch" or\nincrease the contrast of an image by\nspecifying low and high ON values; all pixels that have ON values lower than the\nspecified "low" then become black, and\nall pixels that have ON values higher than\n\nthe specified "high" value become white.\nPixels between the low and high values\nare evenly shaded between black and\nwhite.\nIMDISP is written in a modular form to\nmake it easy to change it to work with different display devices or on other computers. The code can also be adapted for\nuse in other application programs. There\nare device-dependent image-display\nmodules, general image-display subroutines, image inpuUoutput routines, and\nimage-label and command-line-parsing\nroutines.\nThe IMDISP software system is written\nin C language (94 percent) and Assembler\n(6 percent). It was implemented on an IBM\nPC with the MS DOS 3.21 operating system. IMDISP has a memory requirement\nof about 142K bytes. The program was developed in 1989 and is copyrighted.

CAMRAD, a program designed\nfor rapid input and retrieval of all data used\nin engineering-to-manufacturing support\noperations, aids the engineer by automating the material-review-disposition process. Before CAMRAD, material-review record searches were manual. The time spent\nsearching through old documents precluded the timely disposition of new material\nreviews. CAMRAD facilitates the research\nof material-review histories and provides\nfor the efficient processing of materialreview documents.\nThree SmartWare project files control\nthe operation of CAMRAD. The project file\nCAMRAD initializes variables for the other\nproject files and specifies the paths of the\nCAMRAD program, data-base files, and\ndocument files. The project file DATARAD\ncontrols all data-management functions.\n\nThe ability to treat boundaries that have\narbitrary shapes is one of the most desirable\ncharacteristics of a method for generating\ngrids. The Three-Dimensional Grids About\nAnything by FOisson\'s Equation (3DGRAPE)\ncomputer program is designed to make\ncomputational grids in or about almost any\nshape. These grids are generated by the\nsolution of FOisson\'s differential equations\nin three dimensions. The program automatically finds its own values for inhomogeneous terms that give near-orthogonality and\ncontrolled grid-cell height at boundaries.\nGrids generated by 3DGRAPE have been\napplied to both viscous and inviscid aerodynamic problems, and to problems in other\nareas of fluid dynamics.\n3DGRAPEuses zones to solve the problem of warping one cube into the physical\ndomain in problems of computational fluid\ndynamics. In a zonal approach, a physical\ndomain is divided into regions, each of which\nmaps into its own computational cube. It\n\n58\n\nis believed that even the most complicated\nphysical region can be divided into zones,\nand since it is possible to warp a cube into\neach zone, a grid generator that is oriented\nto zones and provides communication\nacross zonal boundaries (where appropriate) solves the problem of topological complexity.\n3DGRAPE accepts input in the form of\nalready-distributed x, y, z coordinates on\nthe bodies of interest - coordinates that\nremain fixed during the entire grid-generation process. The 3DGRAPE code makes\nno attempt to fit given body shapes and redistribute points thereon. Body fitting is a\nformidable problem in itself.. The user must\neither be working with a body of some simple analytical shape, upon which a simple\nanalytical distribution can be easily effected, or must have available some sophisticated stand-alone body-fitting software.\n3DGRAPE does not require the user to\nsupply the block-to-block boundary surfaces or the distribution of points on them.\n3DGRAPE typically supplies those blockto-block boundaries simply as surfaces in\nthe elliptic grid. Thus, at bIock-to-block boundaries the following conditions are obtained:\n(1) grid lines match up as they approach\nthe block-to-block boundary from either\nside, (2) grid lines cross the boundary with\nno discontinuity in slope, (3) the spacing\nof points along a line piercing the boundary\nis continuous, (4) the shape of the boundary is consistent with the surrounding grid,\nand (5) the distribution of points on the boundary is reasonable in view of the surrounding\ngrid.\n3DGRAPE offers a powerful buildingblock approach to the generation of complicated three-dimensional grids, but it is\na low-level software tool. Users can build\neach face of each block as they wish. from\na wide variety of resources. 3DGRAPE uses\npoi nt-successive-over -relaxation (pointSOR) to solve the FOisson equations. This\nmethod requires a large number of iterations, but it vectorizes nicely. Any number\nof sophisticated graphics programs can be\nused on the stored output file of 3DGRAPE\neven though it lacks interactive graphics.\nVersatility was a prominent consideration\nin developing the code. The block structure allows a great latitude in the problems\nit can treat. As the full title of 3DGRAPE\nimplies, this program should be able to handle just about any physical region into\nwhich a computational cube or cubes can\nbe warped.\n3DGRAPE was written in 100 percent\nFORTRAN 77 and should be machine-independent. It was originally developed on\na Cray computer under COS and tested on\nan IRIS 2500T workstation under UNIX.\nThis program was written by Reese L\nSorenson of Ames Research Center.

These\nassumptions permit the use of Bernoulli\'s\nequation of unsteady motion in a nonlinear,\npotential-flow form. This equation is transformed to a reference frame attached to\nthe blade. The boundary conditions include\nzero perpendicular velocity on the surface\nof the blade. The wake is represented by\na vortex sheet shed by the trailing edge\nof the blade. Bernoulli\'s equation is solved\nby a transonic-rotor-flow code, TFAR-2.\nFor the dynamical analysis of the blade\nstructure, Hamilton\'s principle is applied\nto derive finite-element equations, using\npotential-energy equations from the theory\nof elasticity of beams. Shape functions are\nintroduced to describe the deflections as\nfunctions of position within each element\nin flapping, lagging, axial-extension, and\ntwisting modes. Mass, stiffness, and\ndamping matrices are derived from the\nequations for the kinetic energy, equations\nfor potential energy, and semiempirical\nmodal damping equations, respectively. A\nglobaillocal coordinate-transformation\nmatrix reduces the inaccuracies caused\nby large deformations of the blade.\nThe structural and aerodynamical portions of the analysis are combined in the\nfollowing procedure (see figure):\n1. The full-potential transonic-rotor-flow\nequations are solved by the TFAR2 code,\nand the lift, drag, and moment on each\nsection of the blade are calculated.\n2. The aerodynamic forces are converted\nto the corresponding forces at the end\nnodes of the elements by applying the\nshape functions and using Gauss\nintegration.\n\n3. The equation of the structural dynamics\nis rotated from the local to the global\ncoordinate system and integrated in the\ntime domain by Newmark\'s method (an\nextension of the linear-acceleration method) to obtain the displacements of the\nend nodes of the elements.\n4. The deformation of the blade is read into TFAR2, and a new grid system with\nnew surface boundary conditions is generated for the next step in the aerodynamical calculations.\nSteps 1 through 4 are repeated until the\ndesired conditions are reached.\nThe aeroelasticity analysis was perbmed\non an experimental helicopter rotor. The\nstructural portion was evaluated by comparing the computed natural vibrational\nfrequencies of the blade with experimental data. In general, the correlation was\nfound to be good for most of the four types\nof modes. The coupled aerodynamical and\nstructural codes were used to study the\naeroelastic effect in the transonic regime\nin both hover and forward flight. According\nto the numerical results, the effect of\nelastiCity in hover is not as important as\nit is in forward flight. But in forward flight,\neven at a low advance ratio, the blade\nelastic response due to unsteady aerodynamic forces is Significant, and it is necessary to take elasticity into account to 0btain accurate predictions of flow.\nThis work was done by I-Chung Chang\nof Ames Research Center and Ue-Mine\nGea and Chuen-Yen Chow of the University of Colorado.

Such structures are generally too\nfrail to support their own weights on Earth.\nTherefore, to determine experimentally the\nshapes, frequencies, and damping parameters of the vibrational modes of a structure in a test facility on the ground, it is\nnecessary to suspend the structure in a\nmanner that not only allows freedom of\nmotion similar to that found in outer space\nbut that also relieves those stresses within\nthe structure that are due to the weight\nof the structure itself.\nThe suspension system must support\nthe structure and allow freedom of motion\nwithout distorting the natural vibrational\nmodes of the structure.

However,\nto obtain the required extremely low frequencies, one must make a simple pendulum suspension prohibitively long. In addition, suspension from fixed cables can\nSignificantly affect the torsional vibrational\nmodes of the structure. To allow torsional\nfreedom of motion for a space structure\nundergoing ground testing, a low-frequency torsional suspension system has been\ndesigned. This concept involves a plurality of suspension stations attached to the\nspace structure along its length to suspend it from an overhead support.\nThe suspension system (see figure)\nwould include a number of suspension stations attached by cables to a space structure (such as a truss beam) along its length.\nThe suspension stations would be fixed to\na ceiling or other rigid support. Although\nonly the end stations are illustrated in the\nfigure, a sufficient number of additional\nsuspension stations would be placed\nbetween the end stations. The exact number of stations would depend on the length\nand strength of the space structure to be\ntested.\nThe system is designed to alleviate the\ncoupling between the suspension system\nand the torsional vibrational modes of the\nstructure. To accomplish this, each station\nwould include two cables of the same\nlength and a rotatable supporting disk. The\ncables and disk would act together to lower the frequency of the torsional vibrational\nor rotational mode of the suspension system. It is desirable to keep the fundamental natural frequency of the system significantly lower than the lowest structural\nfrequency, which, for one 6O-m test mast\nbeam, was found to be 0.18 Hz.\nThe disk would be free to rotate about\na horizontal axis_The cables would be arranged to form a parallelogram, abed, such\nthat at rest, the center of gravity of the\nbeam would hang directly below the axis\nof rotation of the disk_The system would\nhave two uncoupled natural pendulum\nmodes: one would be the simple pendulum mode; the other would be the torsion or compound pendulum mode involving rotation of the suspended body about\nits own center of graVity. The vertical distance between the points of attachment\nof the cables to the disk and the axis of\nrotation of the disk is adjusted to lower the\nfrequency of the suspension system to a\nlevel at which the motions of the suspension system do not interfere with the motions of the space structure, thereby enabNASA Tech Briefs.

In addition, the dynamic\ncharacteristics of such systems could be\nimproved further through the use of activefeedback-control techniques. The torsion\nsuspension system could be combined\nwith a lateral pendulum suspension system that included an active feedback control system. This arrangement would lower\nthe frequency of the pendulum by controlling lateral motion of the suspension point.\nincreasing the effective length of the ca-\n\nbles.

Many of Europe\'s\nsuccesses in the exploration and\nexploitation of space have been the\nresult of collaborative ventures, some\nof which have been undertaken with\nthe United States. These include\nscientific projects such as COS-B,\nExosat, Giotto, Hipparcos, the Hubble\nSpace Telescope, and the recently\nlaunched Ulysses sun probe. Such joint\nprograms as Ariane, Spacelab,\nMeteosat, and the European communication satellites are important symbols\nof Europe\'s technical capacity and\npolitical will. The all-weather satellite\nERS-l, scheduled for launch this\nspring, and the follow-on mission ERS2, will provide a new perspective for\nbetter understanding and monitoring\nthe Earth and its environment.\nThis is an important year for the\nEuropean space effort. The European\nSpace Agency\'s member states are\nfaced with the decision of whether or\nnot to move from the preparatory stage\nto the development phase of two of the\nagency\'s key programs: the Hermes\nspaceplane and Columbus, Europe\'s\ncontribution to space station Freedom.\nWith the exception of the Ariane\n\nJean-Marie Luton, ESA director general\nprogram, the ESA has never before\nbeen confronted with projects of this\ndimension.\nThere is no doubt that the future of\nEurope-its industrial performance and\nits political standing-is closely linked\nwith technological innovation. The\nchallenge of developing a vigorous and\nstrong European space program will\ntake considerable political will and a\nfirm belief by our governments that\nlong-term benefits can accrue from\nsuch a commitment\nBut the success of our efforts in\nspace research and technology also\ndepends on many other factors, in\nparticular the close cooperation\nbetween the scientific and industrial\ncommunities participating in these joint\nundertakings of common European\ninterest.\n\nI believe Europe\'s future in space\nwill be measured by our ability to\ncooperate. The challenge ahead of us\ncan only be met with a common\nEuropean effort, and cooperation on a\nworldwide basis. I am convinced\nEurope possesses all the resources\nand talent necessary to move forward\nin the exciting adventure of space.\nNASA Tech Briefs performs a\nvaluable service in demonstrating the\nimpact of space technology on our\ndaily lives. I hope that this special\nsection will give its readers a new view\nof the magnificent ventures in which\nthe ESA and its member states are\ninvolved.\nJean-Marie Luton\ndirector general\nEuropean Space Agency\n\n(SpecIal Advertlsong Supplement)\n\nEurope, AMajor A\nnd\nIndependent Space Power\nurope is ranked third among\nleading space powers , following\nthe USA and USSR. Initiated a\nquarter century ago at a rather\nmodest pace by its four major industrialized countries, the European space\neffort has worked towards more\nambitious space ventures since 1975,\nwhen its resources were pooled to forlTl\na single cooperative body, the European Space Agency (ESA) .\nThe ESA currently has 13 member\nstates: Austria, Belgium, Denmark,\nFrance, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden ,\nSwitzerland, and the United Kingdom .\nFinland is an associate member, and\nthe agency has a cooperative agreement with Canada. The ESA\'s three\nlargest shareholders , by the magnitude\nof their contribution, are: France (25%),\nGermany (20%) , and Italy (15%).\nTogether they provide nearly two-thirds\nof the agency\'s resources.\nThe ESA\'s 1991 budget is more\nthan 2.4 billion Accounting Units (AU)\nor ECU , or nearly $3 billion. Europe\'s\nspace spending is thus one-tenth of the\ncombined expenditures of the US\nDepartment of Defense and NASA. It\nmust be remembered , however, that\nEurope has no defense space program\nas yet, except for limited military and\ngovernment systems such as the\nSyracuse and Helios communication\nand observation satellites in France\nand the Skynet communication\nsatellites in the UK. Italy is still contemplating building its own Sicral communication satellite system .\nThe Europeans are still able to rival\nmajor-power efforts with varied and\nless expensive systems in the fields of\nscience , microgravity, technology,\ncommunications, meteorology, and\nremote sensing . Over the last two\ndecades, Europe has successfully\nlaunched dozens of satellites and\nachieved important cooperative\nventures with the USA and USSR.\n\nE\n\nPhoto courtesy ESA\n\nThrough the ESA, Europe has been\nespecially successful in developing\nscientific and application satellites. The\nlatter are operated by European user\norganizations. ECS and MARECS\ncommunication satellites, for example,\nhave been handed over to Eutelsat and\nInmarsat, and the Meteosat weather\nspacecraft are now operated by\nEumetsat.\nThe most well-known achievement\nin this field, however, is the Ariane\nfamily of European launchers developed by the ESA. Ariane is marketed\nand operated by Arianespace, the first\nprivate space transportation company,\nwhich has captured more than half of\nthe worldwide commercial launch\nmarket.\nEurope is now engaged in more\nambitious and costly ventures such as\ndeveloping the Columbus space\nstation , the Hermes reusable\nspaceplane, and the Ariane 5 heavy-lift\nlauncher. Th is triad is the centerpiece\nof Europe\'s effort to achieve an\nindependent and autonomous capability in manned space flight by the turn of\nthe century.\n\nArtist\'s conception of a test launch of the\nHermes spaceplane from Kourou in the\nyear 2000.\n\nAlso Read\nNASA Tech Briefs\'\nJuly 1990 Report\nAs most European space organizations mentioned in this report have already been spotlighted in a special section published last July (NTB vol. 14, No.\n7), we will not provide background\non them now, except for those\nappearing here for the first time.\nThis report instead will concentrate on current and planned activities by European firms and\nagencies.

Ministers from the 13\nmember states participating in the\nmanned spaceplane and space station\nprograms will have to give the goahead for the full development of\nHermes and Columbus, and the\nassociated data-relay satellite (DRS)\nsystems.\nThe heavy-lift rocket Ariane 5 is the\nonly major new element of Europe\'s\nlong-term space plan engaged since\nthe last ministerial council of ESA was\nheld at the Hague in November 1987.\nThe next meeting is scheduled for\nGermany in October or November. The\nobjective is to begin full development\n(phase two) of both Columbus and\nHermes in early 1992, if it has been\ndemonstrated to the ministers\' satisfaction that both programs are technically\nfeasible within the budget defined in\n1987.\nThe ESA is committed to building a\nman-tended free-flying laboratory and\npressurized module (similar to\nSpacelab) which will be permanently\nattached to space station Freedom.\nBoth facilities are primarily dedicated to\nmaterials and life sciences research\nunder microgravity conditions.\nThe Hermes reusable spaceplane,\nsimilar to but smaller than the space\nshuttle, is designed to carry up to three\nastronauts and 3 tons of payload in\nlow-Earth orbit for autonomous\nmissions or for servicing manned\nstations flying at 450 km . Hermes will\nbe launched by the manned version of\nAriane 5. As the successor of Ariane 4,\nthe heavy-lift rocket is mainly designed\nfor launching commercial satellites in\n\ngeostationary or polar orbits. The\nschedule for the heavy-lift vehicle\nremains unchanged, with two qualification flights planned for 1995.\nEarlier this year, the ESA suggested\na slowdown in the development of\nColumbus and Hermes in order to ease\nbudgetary constraints.\nESA\'s new strategy for manned\nspace programs was unveiled I. st\na\nFebruary at a special council meeting\nheld in Santa Margherita, Italy. A\nrevised version of the European longterm space plan was submitted to\nmember states by Jean-Marie Luton,\nESA\'s new director general. The\nupdated scenario addresses annual\nfunding problems by extending by two\nor three years the development phases\nof Columbus and Hermes.\nThe Attached Pressurized Module,\nfully dependent on Freedom, is now\nplanned for launch in 1998, while the\nman-tended free-flyer (MTFF) has\nbeen postponed until 2001 . Hermes\'\nfirst unmanned flight is now planned for\n2000, and the manned flight for 2001.\nDelaying Hermes and the MTFF until\nthe turn of the century will save 10.4%\nor 3.2 billion ECU, thus reducing the\noverall funding request for the longterm plan to nearly $36 billion (1986\ndollars) or 30 billion ECU.

It also manufactures carbonfiber payload adapters and other\ncomponents.\nAerospatiale is playing the same\nrole of industrial architect and stage\ncontractor for Ariane 5, the largest\nrocket ever built in Europe. The\ncompany is conducting design studies,\nprogram management and planning,\nand system testing and checkout. It is\nalso in charge of the two main stages:\nthe solid boosters and the main\ncryogenic stage.\nThe tank has impressive dimensions: 100 feet tall and nearly 18 feet\nin diameter. It weighs 12.5 tons and\ncontains 155 tons of liquid cryogenic\npropellant. It is composed of aluminum\nalloy panels which are welded by two\ngiant machines and then pressuretested in a 98-foot-deep well.\nThis facility is part of the Ariane 5\nintegration bu ilding recently erected at\nLes Mureaux. It stands alongside the\nSeine river, allowing the stages to be\nloaded on barges and taken to Le\nHavre, then transferred onto the SS\nAri ana to cross the Atlantic to Cayenne\n(French Guiana).

To date,\n99 Ariane 4 rockets have been ordered\nby Arianespace for missions into the\nlate 1990s.\nAerospatiale\'s three main responsibilities are technical management of\nthe program , system engineering, and\nintegration of Ariane\'s elements. The\ncompany develops the three stages,\nboosters, and fairings in cooperation\nwith leading European companies such\nas British Aerospace, Matra Marconi\n\nbecomes operational.\nThe fifth-generation\nrocket is based upon an\nentirely new design. It\nfeatures a main stage fitted\nwith one cryogenic engine\nflanked by two large strapon boosters filled with 250\ntons of solid propellant.\nPlanned for use until 2015,\nAriane 5 will be able to\nlaunch one or more\nsatellites representing a\ntotal mass of 6.9 tons into\ngeostationary transfer orbit;\na Columbus space station\nmodule of 18 tons ; or the\nHermes spaceplane at 23\ntons.\nMore powerful versions\nof Ariane with recoverable\nelements are anticipated\nfor the future.

The company also envisions reusable rocket stages and\nboosters equipped with air-breathing\nengines.\nRegarding Hermes, significant\nchanges have been made in the\nprogram structure to increase the\nefficiency and coherence of the\nmanagement before entering the\ndevelopment phase early next year.\nFour leading European aerospace\ncompanies-Aerospatiale and Dassault\nAviation of France, Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, and Alenia of\nItaly-have formed a fully -i ntegrated\nprime contractor team called EuroHermespace. The same has been\ndone at the agency level by forming an\nESA-CNES program team.\nThe program report was delivered to\nmanaging agencies last March. The\ndocument describes the technical\ndefinition of the chosen configuration ,\ncalled Hermes Stage 1. It is the\nreference configuration for the industrial proposal and the development\nprogram. The spaceplane layout has\nbeen optimized by moving the center of\ngravity forward to balance the craft for\natmospheric reentry, and by improving\nthe aerodynamic shape through\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD).\n"We now have a sound basis on which\nto proceed with the project," says Jorg\nFeustel-Buechl, director of space\ntransportation systems for the ESA.\nHermes is being designed for launch\nby an Ariane 5 from Kourou and will\njoin the Columbus space station in lowEarth orbit at an altitude of about 450\nkm with an inclination of 28.5\xc2\xb0. The\nspaceplane will be manned by a crew\nof three astronauts including two pilots ,\nand will carry a payload of about 3\ntons. The European shuttle will be able\nto remain docked to the man-tended\nfree-flyer for one week. It will then\nreenter the atmosphere at hypersonic\nspeed and land on a runway in Korou .\nTwo flights a year are planned after\n2001 to service the MTFF.\nAerospatiale also has a $240,000\ncontract to study an automated\nlogistics vehicle for carrying payloads\nto a future European space station.\nCalled LoVe , the vehicle is to be\nlaunched by an Ariane 5.

This year and next, the\nEuropean rocket company plans nine\nlaunches of its Ariane 4 liquid-propellant rocket. Three rockets have been\nlaunched since the beginning of the\nyear. The next flight will carry the first\nEuropean radar-observation satellite,\nERS-1, and the following flight will\ntransport an Intelsat 6 communication\nsatellite built by Hughes Aircraft. It will\nbe launched by the Ariane 44L, the\nmost powerful version of the European\nrocket, which is fitted with four liquid\nstrap-on boosters.\nArianespace has orbited 44 satellites in the last 44 months. "It\'s a world\nrecord," says Charles Bigot, the new\ncompany chairman. He succeeded\nFrederic d\'Aliest, founder and first\nchairman of the European launch\nconsortium, in 1990 shortly after\nArianespace celebrated its tenth\nanniversary.\nSince its inception in March 1980,\nthe company has booked 92 satellite\nlaunch contracts. Arianespace has 34\nsatellites contracted for launch in\ncoming years, collectively worth more\nthan $2.6 billion. Today, over 80\npercent of the world\'s commercial\nsatellite operators fly Arianespace and\nits European workhorse, Ariane 4.\nIndustry has ordered a total of 99\nAriane rockets , including a single batch\nof 50 Ariane 4s worth about $3.4 billion\n-the single largest order of commercial rockets ever placed in Europe. Last\nyear, the company\'s net sales\namounted to $660 million and its net\nprofit after taxes was $22 million.\nAlthough Arianespace\'s in-house staff\nnumbers only 275, there are 12,000\npeople working on the Ariane program\nthroughout Europe.\nFor the coming decade,\nArianespace forecasts limited market\ngrowth averaging 20 satellites per year\nworldwide, excluding the USSR.\nPatrice Larcher, Arianespace marketing manager, expects the launch rate\nto increase in coming years to re-equip\n\nAmerican networks and replace\ncommunication satellites for international organizations such as Intelsat,\nInmarsat, Eutelsat, and Panamsat.\nLarcher believes that "the market will\nbe very steady until 1993-94." After\n1994, he expects launch rates to dip as\nthe size and weight of satellites grow\nsignificantly.\nFuture communication satellites will\nbe dlfferent from today\'s spacecraft,\nLarcher explains. They will feature\noperational lifetimes of 14-16 years,\ninstead of the current norm of 10-12\nyears , as well as a four-fold increase in\ncircuit capacity, to over 100,000\ncircuits.\nTomorrow\'s communication satellites will also be heavier. Within five\nyears, the average mass of world\ncommunication satellites will increase\ntwo-fold, from 1.2 to 2.4 tons. But the\nheaviest satellites-such as Telstar 4\nand Intelsat 6, 7, and 8-will represent\nonly five percent of the market.\nArianespace is anticipating further\nincreases in the annual accumulated\nlaunch weight of commercial satellites,\nfrom 40 tons in 1991 to 50 tons in\n1993. They predict that within the next\ndecade the total launch mass will rise\nto nearly 60 tons per year.\nIn order to maintain its market share\nand leadership, Arianespace is\naggressively pursuing new customers\nabroad, particularly in the Americas,\nthe Middle East, and Asia. The firm\'s\nobjective is to keep at least 50 percent\nof the world commercial launch market,\ndespite its evolution.\nArianespace officials are confident\nthat Ariane 4 will be able to handle the\ngrowing mass of commercial satellites\nfor the next five years. The company\nwill then shift to the more powerful\nAriane 5 heavy-lift rocket, which is\nexpected to be operational in 1996.\nAriane 5 will allow dual launches from\nKourou of satellites weighing 2.6 tons\neach, or single launches of payloads\nup to 6.8 tons into geostationary\ntransfer orbit. The rocket also will be\nable to launch recoverable capsules,\nspace station elements such as\nColumbus, and the Hermes\nspaceplane.\n\nTHANKS AND CONGRATULATIONS!\nCongrat:ulat:ions to all the scientists, engineers and companies\nwho have cooperated in the implerrumtaJ:ion of the t,pace programs\nwhich have made Prance one of the ma[jor actors\nin the conquest of t,pace to better serve the world.\n\nSpace policies\nAerospace industry\nLaunch\nOperational orbit\nControl and exploitation\n\nAntares,\nArgos,\nAriane IV;\nAriane V;\nColumbus,\nCospas/Sarsat,\nDoris,\nGamma,\nHeMS,\nHeT7M8,\n\nHipparcos,\n180,\nLocstar,\nPkob08,\nSigma,\nSpot,\nTDF,\nTelecom,\nTele-\'.C,\nTopex-Poseidon,\nVega, ...\n\n=\n\n1\n:>\n\nE\n\ne\n8\n~\n\nWE OPEN UP SPACE\nCircle Reader Action No. 345\n\n(Spec,al Advertising Supplement)\n\nAustria is developing life support equipment for the Hermes spaceplane.\n\nAustria has produced some of the\nworld\'s greatest composers , including\nMozart, Strauss, Haydn, and Schubert.\nBut music is not the country\'s only\nquality product.\nToday, Austria\'s industry is engaged\nin research and development of space\ntechnologies in the framework of the\nESA. Twenty highly-specialized firms\nare competing for services and product\ndevelopment contracts within the\nESA\'s scientific, communication , Earth\nobservation , Ariane 5, and Hermes\nprograms. Together they have formed\nthe Association of Austrian Aerospace\nCompanies , known as Austrospace.\nFor more than a decade, Austrian\ncompanies and research institutes\nhave participated in the ESA telecommunication program , including the\nconstruction of Olympus, the largest\ncommunication satellite ever built in\nEurope. Austria specializes in the\ndevelopment of flight hardware, ground\nterminals, and software. Austrian\nuniversities and institutes have\nsimulated the distance between the\nEarth and a communication satellite,\nand the influence of the atmosphere\nand weather on communication quality\nin the high-frequency area, thereby\nproviding basic research necessary to\ndevelop future commercial systems.\nAustria\'s space industry is active in\nthe development of European scientific\nspacecraft, including the ISO infrared\ntelescope. The Austrian company ORS\nhas produced and delivered a large\n\nmechanical sun shield designed to\nprotect the delicate infrared sensor and\nits helium tank. The shield\'s support\nstructure was developed by ORS and\nmanufactured by Advanced Composites Technologies (ACT).\nORS is providing the thermal\ninsulation system , mechanical ground\nsupport equipment, and structural\nelements for the Soho and Cluster\nscientific satellites. A significant part of\nthe electrical ground support equipment is being produced by Schrack\nAerospace. Schrack and the Vienna\nTechnical University are fabricating a\nlaser intersatellite link for future\ncommunication satellites.\nIn Graz, the Joanneum Research\nInstitute has developed a videoconference system which links up to\nfour groups in different countries via\nsatellite. And Schrack has developed\nterminals for "satellite telephone"\nsystems similar to those demonstrated\nso impressively during the Gulf war by\nPeter Arnett of CNN .\nEarth observation has also attracted\nmany Austrian aerospace firms,\nincluding ORS and Schrack, which\nprovided ground support equipment for\nthe ESA\'s first radar-observation\nsatellite-ERS-1.

Over the last 30 years it has\nbuilt or helped to build 100 spacecraft\nand has played a leading role in achieving many of the milestones in the\nrelatively short history of space exploration and commercialization .\nBritish Aerospace (BAe) produced the\nfirst scientific satellite launched by the\nESA and its first communication satellite.\nIt was prime contractor for Europe\'s first\ngeostationary scientific spacecraft and\nthe highly successful Halley\'s Comet\ninterceptor, Giotto. The company has\nbeen building the Skylark sounding\nrocket since 1957. With over 400\nsuccessful launches, Skylark is one of\nthe world\'s longest-running space\nprograms.\nBAe is one of the world\'s largest and\nmost experienced suppliers of communication satellites, having participated in\nthe development of more than 70 communication spacecraft, a third of these\nas prime contractor.\nToday, the company is preparing for\nthe challenges of increasing commercialization in the space business. It is developing the technologies to playa leading\nrole not only in the supply of space hardware for new ventures, but also in the\nspecialized services that will be available\nover the next decade and into the 21 st\ncentury.\nOne of the keys to the successful\nexploitation of space is cheap and reliable access to orbit. Seven years ago,\nBAe unveiled its Hotol concept, a reusable spaceship capable of taking off\nlike a conventional aircraft and flying\ndirectly into low-Earth orbit. The spaceship would employ a revolutionary\nhydrogen and atmospheric oxygen propulsion system for the initial stages, then\nconvert at altitude to pure rocket power\n\nusing on-board liquid oxygen. The concept is being pursued jointly with the\nSoviet Union through a study for an\n"Interim Hotol" which omits the airbreathing stage of propulsion by\nlaunching from an Antonov An -225\nheavy-lift transport aircraft at an altitude\nof 9 km .\nLooking to the future , British Aerospace Space Systems has formed a\nnumber of separate but wholly-owned\ncompanies to specialize in a range of\nsatellite-based and related services in\nthe communication and Earth resources\nsectors.\nIn the rapidly-expanding arena of\nprivate and business communication\nnetworks, BAe was one of the first\nEuropean companies to secure licenses\nto act as a Specialized Satellite Services\nOperator, and is currently licensed to\nprovide services in the UK and Germany. The company is pioneering the\nuse of satellites to narrowcast a variety\nof sports events to clubs and other sites\nthroughout the UK. Further afield,\nbusiness communication between North\nAmerica and Europe will be greatly\nenhanced when the powerful BAe-built\nOrion satellite system becomes operational.\nRecognizing the rapid spread of\ncellular telephony, BAe is pioneering the\ndevelopment of mass-market radiobased communication networks as a\nmeans of enhancing-and in some\ninstances competing with-existing fixed\nand mobile telephone systems. BAe set\nup and led a powerful consortium of\ncommunication companies which bid\nsuccessfully for one of the world\'s first\nlicenses to provide a national digital\ncellular telephone service. Known as\nPCN (Personal Communication Network), the system will be operational in\nthe UK in 1992 and is expected to\n\nsupersede "hard-wired" telephone\nsystems. Satellites can be used to supplement these terrestrial networks, providing an economical method of covering\nrural and remote areas anywhere in the\nworld . A 2000-subscriber digital-radiobased telephone system which can be\ninterconnected to a national telephone\nnetwork via satellite is available at a\nmoderate cost.\nAs the UK\'s largest exporter of engineering products, BAe has extensive\nexperience with the technical , financial,\nand organizational problems facing overseas communications operators and\nadministrators. A complete package has\nbeen developed to define and meet their\nneeds.\nAs the world places greater emphasis\non the wise husbandry of the Earth \'s\nenvironment and resources, analysis of\ndata gathered from space-borne\ninstruments becomes more important.\nBAe is very active in this area. It is also\nexperienced in designing and manufacturing a wide range of sensors, and\nwill lead a European consortium to build\nthe Earth observation polar platform that\nthe ESA plans to launch by 2000.\nThe British government contracted\nBAe to establish the National Remote\nSensing Center (NRSC), a commercial\norganization for the collection , archiving ,\nand analysis of Earth observation data.\nWhen combined with existing national\nfacilities , the NRSC will be one of the\nworld\'s leading centers for the analysis\nof remotely-sensed information.\nWithout the backing of large military\nspace programs, the European space\nindustry has found it difficult to remain\nprofitable in an increasingly competitive\nmarketplace. Long established in space\nscience , Europe has emerged over the\nlast decade as a capable commercial\nspace power. British Aerospace Space\nSystems has played a pivotal role in this\nsuccess, just as it intends to do in developing the new products and services the\nspace industry has long promised and is\nfinally capable of delivering.\n\nFrom Ralale to Hermes\n\nThe most advanced technologies\n\nCircle Reader Action No. 347\nDASSAULT\n\n\'SPE""\n\na\n\nPhoto courtesy Dassault AVIatIon\n\nFromH\n\nOassault Aviation , the worldreknowned manufacturer of highperformance civil and military aircraft\nsuch as the Falcon, Mirage, and\nRafale, also is involved in the development of the Hermes spaceplane.\nFollowing the recent restructuring of\nthe Herme3 program for the development phase, Oassault is sharing the\nindustrial prime-contractorship with\nthree other partners-Aerospatiale,\nAlenia, and Oasa-within the new\nintegrated structure of EuroHermespace.\nSince 1985, Oassault has been\nhelping to refine the spaceplane\'s basic\nconfiguration, including its shape,\nthermal protection system, hot structures, and rescue subsystems.

The small but\ninnovative engineering company\nheaded by Manfred Fuchs employs 90\npeople and last year achieved sales of\n$12 million.\nThe firm\'s space activities are\nfocused on the design, development,\nand manufacture of prototype or\nlimited-series hardware for\nmicrogravity experiments, environmental surveillance, and manned\nsystems. OHB is building and flying\nMikroba rocket-like recoverable\ncapsules, which are dropped from\nhigh-altitude balloons to provide short\nperiods of microgravity. The company\nalso built electronic equipment for\nCosima and other zero-gravity\nexperiments for flight on Chinese and\nSoviet recoverable spacecraft. It is\ncurrently developing technology for a\nGerman recoverable capsule called\nExpress which will be launched by\nJapan.\n\nFuchs\' team participated in studies\nof advanced optical and microwave\ndetectors for the Atmos environmental\nsatellite sponsored by the German\nspace agency. OHB has also proposed\nits own projects, including the Pollux\nand Safir satellites for pollution control\nand monitoring. The Bremen firm\nhelped build the Bremsat mini-satellite\n(68 kg) . It will be launched by the\nspace shuttle during the Space lab 02\nmission in 1993.\nLast year, OHB flight-tested for the\nfirst time the Falke (Falcon), a computer-guided scale model of the space\nshuttle measuring 7 m long and\nweighing 600 kg . Flight data gathered\nwith the carbon-fiber replica will be\ncompared to established characteristics of the real shuttle in order to\nvalidate techniques that will be applied\nto a balloon-borne scale model of\nHermes. A model of the spaceplane\nmay also be launched by an Ariane as\npart of project Cobra.

Its\nSpace and Defense Division headed by Pierre Dumas is\nthe most important branch of the company in terms of\nmanpower and sales , with 4500 workers and $290 million\nin sales last year.\nThe division is heavily involved in the European space\nprogram through its development and production of huge\nsolid strap-on boosters for the Ariane 5 heavy-lift rocket.\nThe French company produces the solid propellant filling\nthe rocket boosters, each having a total mass at lift-off of\nabout 250 tons. Ariane 5 is flanked by a pair of three-part\nboosters that produce a total thrust varying from 540 to\n630 tons between lift-off and the end of the 123-second\nburning time, when they are jettisoned at an altitude of\nabout 60 km. Ariane 5 boosters are 25 times larger than\nAriane 4 boosters, which are loaded with less than 10 tons\nof propellant.\nEach Ariane 5 P230 booster is filled with 230 tons of\nButalane, a solid propellant made of aluminum and\nammonium perchlorate, hydroxyl-terminated. SNPE and an\nItalian partner, BPD Difesa e Spazio, have formed a\ncompany called EUPERA to produce the chemical agent in\nnew facilities located in Toulouse and near Bordeaux. The\nmodern, highly-automated plants produce thousands of\ntons of ammonium perchlorate each year for Ariane 5.\nThey also produce the white "magic powder" for MLRS\nartillery rockets built under license from the USA.\nThe French -Italian team set up another joint venture\ncalled Regulus to build and operate the Butalane manufacturing facility in Kourou . Its production will fill the two\nlargest segments of each Ariane 5 booster. The "Usine de\nPropergol de Guyane" (Guiana propellant plant) was built\nby SNPE Ingenierie, the engineering subsidiary of SNPE,\nunder contract from CNES. The facility is scheduled for\ncompletion by mid-year. It will then begin manufacturing\nthe first full-size test model of the huge solid booster.\nFollowing the first two qualification flights of Ariane 5 in\n1995, the UPG will begin production of solid propellant to\nfill 16 boosters per year in correspondence with the\nmaximum annual launch rate of eight Ariane 5s. Only 110\nworkers will be needed to operate the plant in order to\nproduce a maximum of 32 solid segments per year, loaded\nwith a total mass of 3300 tons of Butalane. The UPG will\nbe one of the world\'s largest solid propellant manufacturing\nfacilities.\nSNPE is also investigating new continuous production\nprocesses which could be used to manufacture the\ncomposite propellant if the production quantities become\nvery large. "This new process involves precise on-line\nmonitoring of the feeding of the ingredients to achieve\ncontinuous control over the composition of the propellant,"\nsays Alain Davenas. manager of research and technology\nfor SNPE.\nSNPE Chimie, another subsidiary of the French group,\nis lending the space group its expertise to manufacture and\n\nSNPE\'s solid propellant mixing facility in Kourou features an 11ton capacity.\n\nprocess rocket chemicals for Ariane 4 and 5.

The hybrid tvwoport\nmodel is well suited to characterization of\nthe bidirectional flows of energy in terms of\n~ relationships between input and output\n~nals. The hybrid rrodel (as distinguished\nfrom other 1\'M>port models) leads to an Intuitive representation of the performance\nof the system and can be used to design\nthe system according to the concept of\nbilateral impedance control.\nThe interface between the human q>er-\n\nator and the master and the interface between the slave and the environment are\nthe 1\'M> ports through which the teleoperator exchanges energy between the human\noperator and the environment. In this exchange, the human q>erator exerts controlling forces on the environment through\nthe teleoperator. while feedback from the\nslave back to the master increases the\nsense of realism with which the human\noperator senses the environment (which\nincludes the manipulated object).\nThe tvwoport hybrid model is extended\nto the teleoperator by the analogy between\neffort (foroe) and voltage and the analogy\nbetween flow (velocity) and electrical current (see Figure 1). Thus, the parameters of\n\nthe hybrid two-port model of a real or\nsimulated teleoperator system can be cbtained from its measured or computed input and output dynamical properties. in\nanalogy with the input/output electrical\nproperties and corresponding transimpedance and transadmittance parameters (h\nparameters) of a purely electrical tvwoport\nsystem.\nThe hybrid two-port model is linear: The\nh parameters are derived, in effect, from\nthe second term of a Taylor-series expansion that describes the behavior of the\nsystem in the viCinity of the q>erating point.\nThus, in the purely electrical case, the\nhybrid tvwoport model is used for smallsignal analysis and is applied to a nonlinear\n\nWhere do ~ ~_~ __ .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\nCircle Reader Action No. 408\n\n97\n\nelectrical system by specifying the operating point in question (e.g., the de biases on\na transistor). Analogously, the hybrid twoport model can be applied to a nonlinear\nteleoperator by specifying the operating\npoint in terms of the applicable position and\nvelocity vectors.\nFigure 2 illustrates the incorporation of\nthe hybrid two-port model into a mathematical model of bilateral impedance control.\nExisting systems like those of Figure 1 cannot operate well with even small delays\nbecause information on impedances is\ntransmitted piecemeal as efforts and flows\nare iterated around the complete control\nloop. In bilateral impedance control, a local\nservoloop enforces a commanded effort\nand impedance. The information communicated across the delay can be appropriately filtered to stabilize the system. In the\nsteady state, this enables the operator to\nperceive the characteristics of the environment accurately and presents the environment with a suitable impedance selected\nby the operator.\nBilateral impedance control depends on\nestimators that are capable of identifying\nthe impedance of the environment and of\nthe human operator. In general, such estimation is very difficult because of problems posed by numerical conditioning and\nnoise. Although ideal responses may be\ndifficult to achieve, assumptions about the\nenvironment can extend the usefulness of\nthis approach. For example, the estimators\ncan be assisted by an intelligent system\nwlth a reduced set of impedance vectors\n(ZJ. The task of each estimator is then to\nclassify the effort- and fIow-sensor readings\n\nHuman Operator\n\nTeleoperator\n\nEnvironment,\nIncluding\nManipulated\nObject\n\nFigure 1.

The primary purpose of the program is to determine the drop\nin pressure across the primary labyrinth seal\nof the high-pressure-oxygen turbopump of\nthe Space Shuttle main engine. including\nthe portion of that drop caused by the resistance to flow in the gaseous-oxygen drain.\nHcmeYer, the flexblity of the program st\'OOld\nmake it applicable to other machinery. The\nprogram accommoclates a variety of geometries and includes an iterative routine that\nenables the simulation of flows that choke\nin multiple places. The model and program\nprovide for imprCNed study of various types\nof seal failures and for reviews of the mechanics of seal regions.\nThe user enters input data that describe\nthe geometry of the seal and of the slinger\nupstream of the seal. These data include various radii, the number of lands, the number\nof teeth on each land, and clearances for\n98\n\nthe slinger and each land of the seal. The\nuser rrust also prcMde irpJt data 00 the pressure at the drain exit, the pressure and temperature upstream of the slinger, the speed\nand torque of the pump, the pump coefficients of the slinger, and various loss coefficients that are determined from literature\nand from test data. The user must also enter\nthe rate of flow and the temperature of helium flowing through the purge, because mixing occurs at the exit of the seal. Although\nthe program in its present form worKs only\nfor oxygen and a purge flow of helium, it c0ntains routines that can be modified to express the properties of other fluids.\nWhen beginning a computation with this\nprogram, one makes an initial guess of the\nrate of flow through the seal. An iteration\nis then performed on the rate of flow until\nthe boundary conditions of pressure are\nsatisfied. Supersonic flow is not allowed in\nthis program, but multiple sonic conditions\ncan occur. Incremental steps are taken up\n\nand down the slinger to determine where\nthe liquid oxygen turns to gaseous oxygen.\n(The program can also simulate a COfT\'4)Iet&\nIy-liquid-phase flow.) Heat is added to the\nsimulated flow in the slinger and seal r&\ngions. The flow is allowed to choke only at\nthe end of each land because each land\nis assumed to have constant area at the tips\nof each tooth.

The system was developed to rotate a large instrument - a\ndifferential microwave radiometer that measures cosmic background radiation - at\n120 rpm in synchronism with 6O-Hz alter\xc2\xb7\nnating-current power.\nSynchronous stepping motors were originally selected for drMng the instrument.\nThese motors, however, were found to be\nincapable of starting or maintaining the\ndesired synchronous rotation. The solution\nwas to add an induction motor and a beltand-pulley transmission, which effectively connects the outputs of the induction\nand synchronous motors in parallel (see\n\nfigure). The induction motor provides the\nstarting and maintaining torque. The diameters of the pulleys are chosen so that at\nthe shaft on which the instrument rotates,\nthe rotation that would be caused by the\ninduction motor acting alone slightly leads\nthe rotation that would be caused by the\nsynchronous motor acting alone. The synchronous motor thus becomes an additiona I load with a fixed rate of rotation and\nforces the induction motor into synchronism\nwith the ac power.\nThis work was done by Roger Ratliff of\nGoddard Space Flight Center.

The\ntechnique strips quickly at room temperature; it is not necessary to heat the substrates and thereby cause unwanted diffusion of dopants in the semiconductors.

In the reactor,\nsilane is pyrolized to silicon powder and\nhydrogen gas via a homogeneous decomposition reaction in free space.\nIn the reactor (see Figure 1), a turbulent\nstream of silane is injected downward from\n104\n\na nozzle at the top into a zone surrounded\nby electrical heaters. The incoming silane\nstream mixes with a recirculating flow of\nhot gasses; this heats the silane and causes\nit to decompose into the product silicon\npowder and hydrogen gas. Downstream\nof this recirculation/mixing/reaction zone,\nthe flow becomes essentially a downward\npipe flow consisting of the stream of spent\n\nhydrogen and suspended fine particles of\nsilicon. A quartz liner helps to keep the\nproduct pure by preventing chemical reactions with the metal outer wall of the reactor. The hydrogen is removed through filters\nand recycled to an earlier stage of the overall process, while the silicon particles fall\ninto a hopper for subsequent collection.\nSome silicon powder adheres loosely\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\nIn\n\nPurge Gas\nCH~I.\n\n.00 10 2IIO\'C\n\n/\n\'.0\n\n,.....,.....\n\nI-\n\no.a\n\n"\'"""\nlo.e\n\nI-\n\n"\'"""\nI-\n\n......\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.50\n\n075\n\n\'.0\n\nPoIItion 01 Heller (at; Fraction of length 01 ReacIOf)\n\nAllOtS\n\nFigure 1.

The tool effects essentially the reverse of the insertion process to ease removal and avoid further damage to the\nthreaded inner surface of the hole.\nThe main parts of the tool are a locating\ncylinder, an extemally threaded disk, a shaft,\nand a handle (see figures). A different tool\nmust be used for each hole thread because\nthe external thread on the disk must engage\nthe internal thread in the hole, and the locating cylinder must guide the tool into engagement with the internal thread. The\nthreaded disk includes a cutout that imparts\na sharp edge to the forward end of the\nthread.\nThe tool is slid into engagement with the\nhole, then turned as though to thread it into the hole (for a right-handed thread as in\n\nthe figures, clockwise when viewed from\nthe outside of the hole, counterclockwise\nwhen viewed from the inside). This action\ncauses the sharp leading edge of the\nthread on the disk to pry the outer end of\nthe insert away from the inner surface of\nthe hole. When the tool comes to rest after\nthis initial motion, the end of the insert lies\nbetween two toothed clamping surfaces:\none stationary in the disk and the other on\na part that rotates about a pin and that is\npressed against the insert by a spring.\nThe tool is then turned in the opposite\ndirection, and the ratcheting action of the\nrotatable part of the clamp grips the end\nof the insert tightly. As the tool continues\nto turn, this action winds up the insert to\na slightly smaller diameter, thereby reducing the friction between the insert and the\ninner surface of the hole as it threads the\nFigure 1.

The apparatus applies chemical solutions to commercially purchased unsized\nfibers or in-house-made fibers, to improve\nthe following: handling of fibers, interface\nbonding of fiber to resin matrix during prepreg fabrication, and interface bonding in\nlaminates during molding process. The apparatus is ideally suited for research and\ndevelopment of prototype, tailor-made lowsolid-content solutions.\nStandard units used by manufacturers\nto apply sizings to fibers are not designed\nfor research and development and do not\nprovide for predrying and postdrying in inert gases. They are also not easily adaptable\nto different chemical solutions. The new apparatus was designed for all thermoplastics\nand thermoset resin solutions to be used\nwith graphite-fiber tow consisting of 3,000\nto 12,000 filaments per tow, but it will accommodate other solutions, other numbers\nof filaments, and other types of fibers.\nThe apparatus is illustrated in the figure.\nA spool of unsized graphite fiber is attached\nto an unwinding creel and guided to a glass\ntube that runs through a furnace. The furnace is used to remove any moisture that\nmay be on the fiber and to prepare the sur-\n\nface of the fiber for the application of resin.\nThe fiber runs through a reservoir of resin,\nand after leaving the reservoir, it enters a\nsecond furnace, which removes the solvent picked up in the reservoir. The fiber\nIs next run over a round bar 121n. (30.5 cm)\nin diameter and under a round bar 3 in. (7.6\ncm) in diameter, to control its tension and\nto smooth it. Nitrogen gas is run through\nthe glass tube to prevent the fiber from picking up moisture and to maintain an inert\nenvironment, which is especially Important\nwhen flammable solutions are employed.\nThe fiber is rewound onto a bar that contains an empty cardboard core. The bar is\nturned with a hydraulic pump.\nThis system was designed for research\nand development, with predrying and postdrying in inert environments. It is easily\nadaptable to different chemical solutions\nand is well suited for small-scale, prototype,\ntailor-made fiber systems.

Fast\nand inexpensive conventional x\xc2\xb7ray inspection is used to make a film image of\nthe overall casting, and slower, more costly\ncomputed tomography is used to reinspect\nthe relatively few parts of the casting that\npresent possible diffraction patterns or\nother difficult-ta-interpret features.\nThe method has been effective in resolving ambiguities in radiographs of turbine blades.

A computer analyzes the detector signals and constructs a\ndensity map of the casting at various cross\n\nsections on a video monitor.\nFor example, a conventional radiograph\nmay contain a "ghost" indication, caused\nby grain diffraction, that may be misconstrued as a flaw or may hide a real flaw (see\nFigure 2).

It could be used, for\nexample, to weld a duct that is already\nmounted in place for its intended use.\nThe improved design (see figure) preserves those elements of the original design that are critical to performance and\nendurance, but modifies other elements\nto decrease the overall size of the torch.\nThe original torch works well where radial\naccess is unrestricted and the torch is not\nmoved beyond \xc2\xb190\xc2\xb0 around -the workpiece. The improved torch can be used\nwhere access is restricted to tightly radially\nconfined spaces and is compatible with\nmechanisms that rotate it 360 0 around a\nstationary part with a circular weld jOint.\nThe height of the torch has been reduced from about 6 in. (15.2 cm) in the\noriginal to 2.4 in. (6.1 cm) in the improved\n\ndesign. Whereas the fittings for cooling\nwater were placed on the top in the original\ndesign, they are placed on the side in the\nimproved design. Side-mounted fittings are\npreferable for orbital motions because they\nimprove radial clearance, make the water\nhoses less vulnerable to crimping, and reduce the mechanical load on the torch .\nAlso in the improved design, the electrode\ncollet and collet nut are installed and removed through a hole in the top; this makes\ninstallation and removal much easier than\nin the original design.\nThis oork was done by Kenneth J.

The reductions in\nthe cross sections could also increase the\namplitudes of the transmitted vibrations\nand reduce the loss of heat from the furnaces.\nIn a conventional piezoelectric transducer, the rod is solid and extends into the\nfurnace (see figure). The transducer is\nmounted to the furnace housing at the\nzero-displacement node. Piezoelectric disks\nin the back section drive the transducer,\ncausing the front face of the rod to vibrate\nlike a piston so that it couples sound waves\ninto the furnace levitation chamber. Unfortunately, the solid core readily conducts\nheat away from the furnace. This not only\nreduces the efficiency of the furnace but\nalso increases vulnerability to fatigue at the\nzero-displacement node and endangers\nthe piezoelectric disks, which depolarize\nabove a critical temperature and no longer\nfunction.\nSeveral versions of the reduced-crosssection configuration are envisioned. In\none (version A in the figure), the rod would\ncontain a hollow central core. The crosssectional area available for the conduction\nof heat toward the back section WOUld,\ntherefore, be reduced. To prevent the transfer of heat along the core by convection,\nthe core would not be made to extend\nthrough the front face. The end of the core,\njust behind the front face, would be made\nconical or hemispherical to avoid bending\nresonance of the front face.\nIn general, the amplitude of the displacement of the front face of such a transducer varies in inverse proportion to the\neffective cross section of the rod; therefore,\nas the cross section is decreased, the\nacoustic output should increase. The device would act as a stepped-horn transducer.\nIn version B, many small axial holes\nwould be drilled in the rod from the front\nface to the zero-displacement node. A thin\nplate would cover the front face. The holes\nwould reduce the flux of heat to less than\none-tenth that of a solid rod. Again, the\nacoustic output would increase with the\ndecrease in the effective cross section.\nVersion B would also act as a stepped-horn\ntransducer.\n120\n\nCONVENnONAL SOLID-ROD\nTRANSDUCER\nPerpendicular Holes\nIn Allernatlng"",,:""\nLayers\n\nDisplacement\nNode\n\nptezoelectrlc\nDisk Cemented\nto Metal Rod\nVERSIONC\n\nVERSION B\n\nLevitated\nObject\n\nProcessing\nChambsr\n\nSOund\xc2\xb7\nTransmitting\nPores\n\nHeating\n\nColi\n\nThermal\nInsulation\n\nSOund\xc2\xb7Radlating\nFront Face\n\nDisplacement\nNode\n\nVERSION 0\n\nIn version C, holes would be drilled perpendicular to the axis of the rod, orthogonal to each other in alternating layers. To\nmaintain adequate dynamic strength, the\nnumber of holes per layer would be decreased toward the zero-displacement\nnode. This would reduce the effective\ncross section exponentially toward the\nfront end, producing the amplification characteristic of an exponential-horn transducer. A further advantage of the clear\ntransverse holes is that they could be used\nas channels for cooling gas, which would\nhelp to keep the piezoelectric disks at a\nsafe temperature without interfering with\nthe radiated sound field.\nIn version 0, the cross section for thermal conduction would be reduced, not by\nholes in the transducer, but by interposing a porous barrier between the furnace\n\nA Conventional\nSolid-Rod Transducer Contrasts\nwith\nreduced\ncross-section version (A through C)\nand a porousheat-barrier version (0).

It would enable\ncontrol of the dimensions of metal and\nsemiconductor epitaxial layers in three dimensions instead of the usual single di\xc2\xb7\nmension (perpendicular to the plane of the\nsubstrate). The process might be used to\nmake arrays of highly efficient infrared sensors, high-speed transistors, and quantum\nwires, for example.\nIn an experimental version of the process, cobalt and silicon are deposited together by molecular-beam epitaxy on a silicon substrate in the atomic ratio of about\n1:10_ The silicon-rich mixture produces a\nlayer of Single-crystal, epitaxially aligned\ncolumns of cobalt silicide (CoSiv in a silicon matrix (Figure 1). The columns are\nabout 50 nm across, 200 nm apart, and depending on the total amount of material\ndeposited - 100 nm high. Other diameters\nand spacings can be produced by adjusting\nthe ratio of cobalt to silicon, the temperature\nof the substrate, and the rate of deposition.\nIn the proposed process, CoSi2 columns\nwould be started and stopped by turning the\ncobalt beam on and off during deposition.\nFor the fabrication of electronic devices,\nboth the shapes and the locations of the\ncolumns would have to be controlled_ One\npossible technique for doing this is electron-beam lithography [See "Making Submicron CoSi 2 structures on Silicon Substrates" (NP0-17736), NASA Tech Briefs\nVol. 13, No.9 (September, 1989), page 105].\nAn electron beam could be used to crystallize selected sites on a layer of amorphous CoSi2, and then the amorphous material surrounding the single-crystal sites\nwould be selectively etched away. If a new\nlayer were then added by silicon-rich molecular-beam epitaxy, it seems likely that\nthe CoSi 2 columns would be located predominantly on the crystallized sites, and the\nsilicon matrix would form around them. It\nmay even be possible to form walls, in addition to columns, of CoSi2 by this method_\nIf free-standing columns are needed, the\nsilicon matrix could be removed by plasma\netching in carbon tetrafluoride, which attacks silicon 100 as fast as it attacks ~.\nThus, all the matrix could be rEll\'T\'lC1-Jed before\nthe columns were altered substantially.\nMetaVsemicondJctor systems other than\ncobalUsilicon are also promising for the\ngrowth of columns.

Large, lightweight optical components, particularly mirrors, are required\nfor many space-based systems, such as\nlight detection-and-ranging (UDAR) systems; astronomical telescopes; solar collectors; and concentrators and deflectors\nfor ions, other high-energy particles, and\nlaser beams. Current processes for the\nfabrication of optical components are not\ncapable of rapidly producing high-performance optics, particularly large mirrors with\ndiameters of 1 meter or more.\nA new chemical-vapor deposition (CVD)\nprocess has been developed for fabricating lightweight Si/SiC mirrors. The process\ninvolves three CVD steps: one to produce\nthe faceplate of the mirror, the second to\nform the lightweight back structure that is\ndeposited integrally with the faceplate, and\nthe third and final step to deposit a layer\nof optical-grade material (e.g., Si) onto the\nfront surface of the face plate. The figure\nand finish of the mirror are fabricated into\nthis latter material.\nThe figure shows in detail the CVD fabrication procedure. Ideally, the three CVD\ndepositions can be completed in about 6\nweeks, in sharp contrast to the fabrication\nof glass mirrors, which can take several\nmonths to a few years. CVD can produce\ndense, highly pure polycrystalline materials\nthat can be polished to surface figures of\nhigh precision and finish.\nUsing this process, 7.5-cm-diameter flat\nand curved lightweight mirrors of Si/SiC\nwere successfully fabricated. The mirrors\nwere polished to a figure better than onefifth of a wavelength and a finish of better\nthan 10 A rms. This process is scalable\nand is quite general in that mirrors of other\nceramic materials can also be fabricated.\nFor instance, such advanced ceramic ma-\n\nPrefigured,\nPolished\nSurface\nCoated With\nRelease Agent\n\nCVD Chamber\n\n.\n\ni- ~\n\nLOAD IN &\nCVD CHAMBER\n\nSIC\nDeposited\nby CVD\n\nREMOVE\nMANDREL\nAND DEPOSIT\n\nRELOAD IN\nCVD CHAMBER\n\n..\n\nMOUNT LI GHTWEIGHT GRAPHITE\nSTRUCTURE\n\nLightweight\nGraphite\nStructure\n\nCH3SICI3 + H2\nDEPOSIT SIC\n\nGraphite\nMandrel\n\nReplicated\n\n-_...Itt\n~!\n\nGraphite\nMandrel\n\n!\n\nRELOAD IN\n\nLOU)\n\nP!.":~"\n\nMirror\nUNLOAD AND\nSEPARATE MIRROR\nSUBSTRATE\nFROM MANDREL\n\nSiHCI3+H2\nSIC\n\nLightweight\nGraphite Structure\nEnclosed In SIC\n\nSi\nREMOVE SIISIC\nMIRROR\nSUBSTRATE\n\ntt\n\n\'-_--.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nM\xc2\xbb~\xc2\xbb Vf1\n\n~/-\n\nSI ~IDEPOSIT SI\n\n,...-_...1\n\nCH3SICI3 + H2\nDEPOSIT SIC\n\nFinished\nLightweight\nSIISIC Mirror\n\nFINAL\nFABRICATION\n\nThree Chemical-Vapor Depositions Are Used to fabricate lightweight mirror substrates.\n\nterials as TIB2 and B4C have physical, mechanical, and optical properties comparable to those of SiC and are suitable\nfor use in mirrors.\nThis IIrOrk was done by Jitendra S.

In this method,\na gas shroud is used to isolate the selected\n\narea from the rest of the deposition system.\nA substrate of any shape or size is first\nmounted on a material, such as graphite\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1981\n\nsupport pillars or graphite felt. compatible\nwith the deposition process.

An inert gas. such as\nargon. is made to flow from beneath the\nsubstrate. This flow prevents deposition between the substrate and the ring (see figure).\nThe rate of flow is chosen to maintain\na small differential pressure between the\ngas in the ring and the gas in the furnace.\nThe isolation of the substrate from the rest\nof the deposition furnace prevents the propagation of cracks from the wall of the furnace to the substrate. This method also\nprevents deposition on the back of the\nsubstrate. which deposition often produces\ncracks In the deposited material.\n\nthis method has been extremely successful in the selective deposition of SiC\nin a chemical-vapor-deposition reactor.

With an exceptionally slim outer\nbody, the tool is well suited for work in\nareas of limited accessibility. particularly\nwhen features of the workpiece create\nobstructions.\nThe inner body of the tool fits in a cylindrical outer body (see figure). A guide tip\naligns the tool axially when inserted in a\nhole. A double-edged cutting blade extends radially from the upper portion of the\ntip. A striking surface at the top of the inner body protrudes from the outer body;\nthis surface absorbs hammer blows and\ntransmits them to the blade. The blade is\nthus gradually forced into the workpiece,\ncutting keyslots on opposite sides of the\nhole as it proceeds.\nThe outer body aids in extracting the\ntool from the hole without damage after\nthe slots have been cut. Its internally\nthreaded collar mates with an externally\nthreaded section on the inner body. To\nextract the tOOl, the user turns the diskshaped handle on the outer body clockwise. This action translates the outer body\ndownward as it moves on the threaded inner body.\nWhen the bearing surface on the outer\nbody makes contact with the workpiece,\nthe user continues to tum the handle. The\ninner body now translates upward on the\nscrew thread, pulling the blade and tip\nfrom the hole.\nThe broaching tool previously used had\nan outer body considerably larger in diameter. So that the old tool would fit around\nan obstruction next to the tapped hole. a\nportion of the outer body had to be cut\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\naway - a time-consuming and costly process.

The models were tested for\ntheir effects in capturing the details of\nshocks in hypersonic flows about bodies of\nvarious shapes (see figure).\nThe mathematical context is the lower\xc2\xb7\nupperfsymmetric-Gauss-Seidel (LU\xc2\xb7SGS)\nalgorithm for the solution of the NavierStokes equations of flow in two dimen\xc2\xb7\nsions. Within this context, a variety of\nschemes can be developed by choices of\ndifference operators, Jacobian matrices,\nand invisckHlux vectors:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If one uses upwind operators on the split\ninviscid fluxes on the cIovmwind side and\ntrue Jacobian matrices on the upwind\nside, one obtains an upwind LU\xc2\xb7SGS\nscheme.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If one uses upwind operators on the split\ninviscid fluxes on the cIovmwind side and\napproximate Jacobian matrices on the upwind side, one obtains a semiupwind LU\xc2\xb7\nSGSscheme.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If one uses central difference operators on\nthe unsplit inviscid fluxes on the cIovmwind\nside and approximate Jacobian matrices\non the upwind side, one obtains a hybrid\nLU-sGS scheme.\nIn the first\xc2\xb7and\xc2\xb7third\xc2\xb7order\xc2\xb7dissipation\nmodel, third-order terms formed from\nfourth differences provide background\ndamping. First-order terms are added by\nsecond differences under the control of a\npressure-sensor term, to which the low\xc2\xb7\norder coefficient is proportional.\nThe directionally\xc2\xb7scaled\xc2\xb7dissipation\nmodel has the same structure as that of\nthe original first\xc2\xb7and\xc2\xb7third-order-dissipation\nmodel, except for the f.caling factor. The\nuse of directional scaling provides anisotropic dissipation to each direction, result\xc2\xb7\ning in improved performances on meshes,\nthe cells of which have high aspect ratios.\nThis model is more accurate on coarse\ngrids than is the first\xc2\xb7and\xc2\xb7third\xc2\xb7order\xc2\xb7\ndiSSipation mode\\.\n124\n\nIn the flux\xc2\xb7limited-dissipation model, the\ndissipative flux is not constructed by add\xc2\xb7\ning low-order terms. Instead, functions to\nlimit antidiffusive fluxes are introduced into\nthe high-order terms. The constant paramo\neters of these functions are chosen to provide enough dissipation to suppress nu\xc2\xb7\nmerical oscillations in the neighborhoods\nof shock waves.\nThe dissipative fluxes of the three preceding models have scalar coefficients.\nHowever, the dissipative coefficient for a\nsystem of equations must be a matrix, to\nmeet the requirement of upwinding. In the\nflux-difference-split-dissipation model, this\nmatrix is constructed by splitting flux dif\xc2\xb7\nferences in a way that separates the char\xc2\xb7\nacteristic fields that correspond to the dif\xc2\xb7\nferent wave speeds. This model and the\nflux\xc2\xb7limited-dissipation model can be reo\ngarded as total\xc2\xb7variation\xc2\xb7diminishing\nschemes.\nThe models were tested in a Newton\xc2\xb7\niteration form of the hybrid LU-sGS scheme.\nThe results of these simulations showed\nthat the flux\xc2\xb7limited-dissipation model was\nrobust enough to predict a high\xc2\xb7speed flow\nabout a blunt body with strong shock and\nexpansion waves. The flux-difference\xc2\xb7split\xc2\xb7\ndissipation model captured shocks with\nhigher resolution but was less robust. The\nfirst\xc2\xb7and\xc2\xb7third\xc2\xb7order\xc2\xb7dissipation and the\ndirectionally\xc2\xb7scaled-dissipation models\nturned out to be neither accurate nor\nrobust enough for computations of flows at\nhigh mach numbers.\nThis work was done by S.

An error rate no\ngreater than 10 -6 errors per hour is expected in any software in commercial , industrial, and medical applications in which property and life are at risk. In other words,\nsoftware should have a mean time between\nfailures of at least 100 years.\nThe paper presents four case histories\nof software-safety analysis:\n- The flight-control system of the proposed\nX-wing aircraft;\n- The flight-control system of the vertical!\nshort-takeoff-and-landing research airplane;\n- The high-pressure-ai r distributed-control\nsystem for several wind tunnels at Ames\nResearch Center; and\n-A control system for operating wind tunnels and collecting and proceSSing experimental data.\nIn each case, it is found that practices\nfor assuring software safety are primitive.\nIn each case, an independent, simple, predictable backup element - either software\nor hardware - is needed to protect the\nsystem and its environment if and when\nthe basic software goes bad.\nMoreover, it is unrealistic to expect safetyassurance practices to improve much in\nthe near future. It is not likely that repeated\nlife-cycle testing and analysis will be able\nto bring safety up to the required level.\nOn the other hand, it seems reasonable\nthat safe software can be achieved through\ndesign. To be effective, safety-assurance\npractices of the future will have to take into\naccount the processes used in the development of software and show that the software product can be executed correctly\nunder all possible conditions.\nThis work was done by William R.

In this case , there are reversible\nreactions between the hemoglobin and oxygen .\nThe differential equations that describe unsteady transport\nof oxygen (including the reactions of higher order) in one\ndimension across a solution containing hemoglobin are presented . First, the steady state is considered, and the equations\nare linearized into a coupled set of ordinary differential equations. These equations are put in a matrix form that highlights\nthe disparate time scales related to rates of transport and of\nreaction of the various chem ical species . This linearized form\nis used to develop an explicit formula for the size of the\nboundary-layer region . The facilitated-transport problem is\nshown to be "stiff" in the sense that the solution includes\neigenmodes of disparate spatial scales.\nThe full nonlinear time-dependent equations are solved by\nthe method of time linearization , using an explicit numericalintegration algorithm with direct block tridiagonal solvers . The\nmethod of time linearization involves the expansion of the\nnonlinear term in a Taylor series about the solution at a\nprevious time step. The solutions of the full nonlinear equations\nare presented and c9mpared with results published previously. The most important results of the analysis are the\nfollowing:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reaction models of higher order, which match oxygendissociation-curve data better than do models of lower\norder. yield better agreement between theory and experiments in vitro.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The steady-state oxygen flux through a membrane is\nindependent of the initial conditions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In the computation, the sigmoid oxygen-dissociation curve\n(the ratio of the concentration of oxyhemoglobin to the total\nconcentration of hemoglobin) causes almost 100 percent\noxygen saturation of the high-pressure side of th e membrane and increases the thickness of the boundary layer on\nthe low-pressure side. This latter effect relaxes the stringent\ngrid-resolution problems when numerical meth ods are used.\n\nThis work was done by Sanford Davis of Ames Research\nCenter. To obtain a copy of the report.

We derived constraints such as the number of type I and type II hair cells and\nthe number and lengths of the nerve fiber branches in the\nvarious fields. Probability tables were used with a random\nnumber generator to reproduce examples of biological receptive fields. The results strongly suggest that biological neural\nnetworks develop by constrained randomness in wiring and\nare not entirely genetically determined. In future research, we\nhope to design artificial neural nets completely by constrained\nrandomness to determine whether or not a degree of randomness in wiring is beneficial to artificial systems.\nAs we continue to refine our simulations, we also are\nbeginning to reduce the macular architecture to symbolic block\ndiagrams. Next, these block diagrams will be reduced to\nelectronic circuit diagrams, using small- and medium-scale\nintegrated circuit devices, for implementation in hardware.\nDevelopment of a prototype linear accelerometer chip based\non its biological counterpart should be possible within a few\nyears.\nIn the meantime, what are the attributes of biological neural\nnets that could help us design better parallel-processing\ncomputers? One major observation is that the nervous system\nappears to be organized on the basis of two circuits: highlychanneled and distributed-modifying. There are highly-directed\ninputs to an area, carrying specific data, but the data is\nprocessed further by local or intrinsic circuits that modify the\noutput to another station. Because we find that part of the\ndistributed circuit dampens type II hair cell activity following\ncalyceal voltage changes, it is possible that lateral inhibition is\na fundamental feature of distributed-modifying circuits.\nOur research suggests, however, that a third kind of circuit\nmay exist. This is a system of nerve fibers that comes into an\narea or layer from another site and provides a widely-distributed, biased background of activity against which the channeled and distributed-modifying circuits operate. In natural\nsystems, background activity can be raised or lowered hormonally through increased input or local, reciprocal control.\nHeightened activity in a neuron could release a neurotransmitter to terminals of reciprocal type, activating them to modulate\nthe responses of more distant neurons. This kind of circuit\nmight prove essential to learning, cognition, and creativity, as\n\nAbout The Author\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1991\n\nit could help focus attention to certain incoming information,\ncorrelate neural activity over variable distances. and result in\ndisregard of other simultaneous inputs that might otherwise be\ndistracting. In the human brain , such circuits may provide the\nemotional context within which higher cognitive functioning\noccurs.\nFour other factors appear Important for incorporation into\nartificial neural networks and computer technologies. First,\nbiological neural nets are not modular. Variation in receptive\nfield and network organization is important to parallel processing of incoming information, to segregate discrete parts of the\nmessage for different distributions. Second, biological systems are robust and tolerant of neuron failure. Robustness is\nachieved in part through redundancy, but probably also through\nnonmodularity and constrained randomness in wiring. Third,\nindividual neurons are tiny bits in the machine of intelligence.\nThey are not smart enough to tell another neuron that it is\nresponding in error. Therefore, backpropagation as utilized in\nengineered neural networks does not exist in biological systems. Feedforward-feedback loops and lateral inhibition may\nbe essential, however, to neural functioning. And fourth , constrained randomness in wiring may be typical of all advanced\nbiological neural networks. This suggests that natural neural\nnetworks are dynamically nonlinear.\nWhile we still have a long way to go to understand even this\nsimple mammalian neural network in sufficient detail for extrapolation to computers and robots, a start has been made.\nMoreover, the insights we are obtaining and the technologies\nwe are developing should help advance our understanding of\nthe more complex neural networks that underlie human intelligence. Progress in this area should lead to ever more sophisticated machines. ::l\n\nTAKE A\n\nLOOK\xc2\xb7\n\nLOSER\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLOCA nONS FOR\nMANuFACTURING.\n\nFor a free Prospeaus contact:\nPalmetto Economic Development Corporation\nRepresrnnng Ct-nnal \xc2\xa3Ie .

The composite\'s temperature is raised to approximately 400\xc2\xb0C, which\nis higher than its glass transition temperature,\nso that the material loses weight. The temperature is maintained at 400\xc2\xb0C in the\ninert gas until the weight loss is complete.\nCircle Reader Action Number 747.\n\nFlexible Diaphragm-Extreme\nTemperature Usage\n\n(US Patent No. 4,995,697)\nInventor: Grigory Adamovsky\nA fiber optic interferometer uses as a light\nsource a low-coherence LED laser which is\nfiltered and driven at two AF frequencies, high\nand low. Displacement of a reflecting mirror\nchanges the length traveled by the nonreferencing signal. The low-frequency light undergoes destructive interference, reducing the\nwave\'s coverage intensity, while the highfrequency light undergoes constructive interference, increasing the wave\'s average intensity. The ratio of these two measurements is\nproportional to the displacement incurred.\nCircle Reader Action Number 743_\n\nFiber Optic Sensing System\nThe Dycor Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer offers a dynamic range of 7\norders of magnitude along with a high\nresolution CRT. analog bar. and tabular\ndisplay modes, with on RS-232 port\nfor computer interface as standard\nfeatures.\nThe Dycor product line is manufoctured at our facility in the U.S.A This\npermits us to offer it at 0 price which is\nthe most cost-effective in the industry\nWhether your need is residuol gas\nanalysis, process monitoring, or leak\ndetection, the microprocessor-based\nmodels provide you with the ultimate\nin performance.\n\nApplications include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nResidual Gas Analysis\nProcess Monitoring\nLeak Detection\nChemical Vapor Deposition\nFermentation\nSputtering\nPlasma Etching\nMolecular Beam Epitaxy\nCryogenics\nHigh Energy Physics\nVacuum Furnaces\nEvaporation\nIon Beam Milling\n\nFeatures:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1-100 or 1-200 AMU Range\nFaraday Cup and Electron Multiplier\n9" ar 12" High Resolution CRT\nAnalog Bar or Tabular Display\nPressure vs. Time Display\nLinear to 4 Decode Log Scale\nRS-232 Computer Interface\n10 14 Torr Minimum Detectable\nPartial Pressure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Backgraund Subiraction\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Spectral Library\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sample Systems for higher\nPressures\nFor literature, contact AM ETE K,\nProcess and Analytical Instruments Div.\n150 Freeport Rood, Pittsburgh, PA\n15238, TEL: 412-828-9040,\nFAX: 412-826-0399.\n\nETEK\n\n(US Patent No. 4,989,497)\nInventor: Guillermo Lerma\nMr. Lerma has developed a flexible sealing\nmembrane for applications from -101 \xc2\xb0 to\n+260\xc2\xb0C.
