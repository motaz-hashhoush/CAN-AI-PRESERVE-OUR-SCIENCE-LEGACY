Beggs, NASA Administrator,\nat the ceremony for Spacelab\xe2\x80\x99s arrival\nfrom Europe at the Kennedy Space\nCenter in Florida, February 5,1982.\n\nm a t Is\nSpacelab?\n\nt is one hour after the familiar flame and\nthunder of liftoff. The puffs of exhaust\nand vapor trails have long since dissipated at\nthe Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The\nUnited States Space Shurtle\xe2\x80\x99s Orbiter now\nfloats serenely in weightlessness on the\nopposite side of the Earth, 250 kilometers\n(155 miles) above the Pacific Ocean.\nThe crew of six-the commander, pilot,\ntwo mission specialists and two non-career\nastronauts called payload specialists-begin\npreparations for the scientific work assigned\nto them on this nine-day flight.\nAt a console facing the rear wall of the\nOrbiter\xe2\x80\x99s upper crew compartment-the aft\nflight deck-a mission specialist flips switch\nR-13, marked \xe2\x80\x9cPayload Bay Doors,\xe2\x80\x9d into the\non position. This sets off a 190-second\ncomputer-controlled sequence of latch\nretractions. The huge clamshell doors\nextending the full length of the bus-size\ncargo bay swing wide open, revealing its\ncontents.\nAs crew members look through the two aft\nflight-deck windows into the cargo bay, they\nsee a strange collection of structures as if\ntaken from a frame of a fantasy film.\nResembling a Z-shaped tube, an aluminum\ntunnel one meter (3.3 feet) in diameter runs\nfrom the back wall of the lower crew\ncompartment (mid deck) toward the middle\nof the cargo bay.\nThe tunnel connects with the first of two\njoined cylinders, segments jointly called the\nmodule, near the cargo bay\xe2\x80\x99s center. Behind\nthe module, not visible to the crew from\ntheir windows, rests a U-shaped form, called\na pallet, which like the module fits snugly\ninto the 18-by-4.6-meter(60-by-15-foot)\ncargo bay. Mounted on the pallet are\nantennas, telescopes, and other sensors.\nThis odd-appearingassemblage is one\nconfiguration of Spacelab, the new $1\n-billion\nEuropean-built, NASA-operated spaceborne\nscience laboratory.\nWithin an hour or two, one of the two\npayload specialists and one of the mission\nspecialists float from the mid deck through\nthe tunnel into the module. They begin\noperating some of the many research\ninstruments installed there. From controls\ninside the forward segment of the module\nthey operate instruments mounted on the\nU-shaped pallet. Spacelab has now come alive\nand is at work!\n\nProject Involves M n Nations\nay\nTen years in the making, the most versatile\nresearch facility ever sent into space is now in\n\naction. For the 10 European nations that\ndesigned, constructed, and financed Spacelab\njointly through the European Space Agency\n( ESA) and for NASA, which designed,\nconstructed, and financed the Spacelab\nground facilities and manages the Spacelab\nflights, this is the culmination of history\xe2\x80\x98s\nlargest and most comprehensive\nmultinational space project.\nDuring the next several days the payload\nspecialists and mission specialists will use\ninstruments inside Spacelab to carry out a\nvariety of scientific and technological\ninvestigations. Spacelab is expected to be a\nfrequent passenger inside the Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s cargo\nbay in the years ahead, through the\nremainder of the 1980s and into the 1990s.\nWhenever Spacelab is aboard, it is an\nintegral part of the Orbiter, firmly attached\ninside its body.\nSome Spacelab flights will be \xe2\x80\x9cdedicated\nmissions\xe2\x80\x9d on which the Orbiter cargo bay is\ncompletely devoted to Spacelab-no other\nloads are carried. Other flights will be\n\xe2\x80\x9cmixed cargo missions\xe2\x80\x9d in which Spacelab\noccupies only part of the cargo bay, sharing\nit with other cargo, such as satellites to be\nlaunched from the Orbiter during the flight.\nSome Spacelab flights will be devoted to one\nscientific discipline only and will be called\n\xe2\x80\x9cdiscipline missions.\xe2\x80\x9d The Spacelab system\nlends itself to orbital research in virtually all\nscientific specialties and technological fields.\nFlights carrying experiments of more than\none scientific discipline are called\n\xe2\x80\x9cmultidiscipline missions.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOn a discipline mission devoted to\nastronomy and space physics, payload\nspecialists trained in this science team with\nmission specialists to operate instruments\ninstalled on a pallet. They examine space\nphenomena, such as the behavior of\nelectrified gases, called plasmas, ejected by\nthe Sun and now trapped above the Earth.\nOn a mission devoted to Earth sciences, the\ncommander and pilot maneuver the Orbiter\ninto an inverted position-so that, as seen\nfrom the Earth, it is flying upside down. The\npayload and mission specialists are thus\npositioned to use their Spmelab instruments\nto examine Earth\xe2\x80\x98s atmosphere, land, and\noceans. On missions dedicated to life\nsciences, physicians and biologists observe\nthe impact of prolonged weightlessness on\nthe crew and on plants and microbes. On\nmissions dedicated to materials technology,\nspecialists in alloys, crystals, ceramics,\nglasses, and pharmaceutical substances\n\ninvestigate processes observable only in\nweightlessness.\nEarly Benefits Rossible\nSome Spacelab experiments-particularly\nthose in materials and pharmaceutical\nprocessing-hold high promise of early\nbenefits. Others, like the astronomical\nobservations and plasma investigations, are\nof immediate interest mainly to scientific\nspecialists. All Spacelab work is meant to\nenrich the human storehouse of knowledge.\nSpacelab\xe2\x80\x99s only assignment is to help increase\nour understandmg of natural laws and to put\nthis knowledge to work for human progress\nand betterment.\n\nr\n\nSpacelab is not a spacecraft but rather a\nlaboratory for use in space. More precisely,\nSpacelab is a set of components which can be\narranged in different combinations-or\n\xe2\x80\x9cconfigurations\xe2\x80\x9d-to form a laboratory and\nobservatory tailor-made to the needs of each\nflight\xe2\x80\x99s research objectives. In all its\n\nThepallet@r SL-1,filly\nwith inmMB~\nundqpes tests be@ its\ninstallation in the M&s\ncargo bay.\n\nShirt-SleeveConditions Provided\nIn the long-module configuration the\ninterior of the combined segments becomes a\nroom much like the inside of the passenger\ncabin of a large jet. Three mission and\npayload specialists can work there\nsimultaneously, surrounded by research and\ncontrol apparatus in an almost Earthlike\nenvironment. They breathe normal air, wear\nconventional clothes, and set the temperature\nand humidity to their own liking. Except for\nweightlessness, they can do their research\nalmost as if they were in any modern hightechnology laboratory in their campus,\nindustrial, or government research centers on\nEarth.\nThe far ends of the long module are closed\nwith hnnel-shaped \xe2\x80\x9cend cones.\xe2\x80\x9d The tip-totip distance between end cones is 7 meters\n(23 feet).\nThe U-shaped pallet in the rear of the cargo\nbay serves as a base for research equipment\nneeding a more open view than is feasible\nfrom the module, or requiring direct\nexposure to the radiations and vacuum of\nouter space.\nA pallet weighs 1,200 kilograms (2,650\npounds), is 4 meters (13 feet) wide and 3\nmeters (10 feet) long, and can support a ton\nof instruments for each meter of its lengthabout 3 tons altogether if evenly loaded.\nWith its instruments, the pallet becomes a\nscientific observatory-for studies in\nastronomy, space physics, and Earth sciences.\nSome pallet-mounted instruments are selfcontained and automated and require no\nhuman intervention during flight. Others\nneed to be turned on and off, guided, or\nadjusted-from controls inside the core\nmodule, from the aft flight deck, or remotely\nfrom the ground by radio command.\nEventually, when all components for two\ncomplete Spuehb sets are delivered from\nEurope, NASA will have 2 core modules, 2\nexperiment modules, 10 identical pallets, and\naddition to research instruments, is called the various items of auxiliary hardware.\ncore segment.

When joined, these two\ncylinders are simply called the long module.\nWhich of these components are used on a\nAlone, the core segment is also called the\nflight depends on the research objectives and\nshort module.\nequipment needs of the mission.\nDeciding on the mission configuration\nand which components to use resembles the\nproblem of a Broadway theatrical producer\nwho must select, together with his director\nand other specialists, the right combinations\nof lights, microphones, and scenery to\n\nconfigurations Spacelab remains solidly\nanchored to its host and carrier, the Orbiter,\nfor the duration of the mission.\nSpaceLab makes possible the transfer of new\nsophisticated apparatus and high-technology\nlaboratory instruments into Earth orbit. In\nachieving this feat engineers have come up\nwith many imaginative solutions to the\nproblems of operating in space.\nNames used in describing Spacehb\ncomponents and the equipment housed in\nthem tend to be much less glamorous than\nthe items themselves. The cylindrical\nsegments-truly ingenious engineering\nfeats-are prosaically dubbed habitable\nmodules.\nEach segment is 2.7 meters (9 feet) long\nand 4 meters (13 feet) in diameter. They are\nmade of aluminum alloys covered with a\nthick blanket of multilayered insulation.\nThe forward segment, which contains\ncontrols and monitoring equipment in\n\n.\ne\n\nI;:\n\nc\n\nModule and palkt are\nreadied@ SL-1.\n\n5\n\nachieve desired results through three or more\nacts of a stage play.\nWhen a SpaceZab mission requires it, as\nmany as two pallets can be installed in the\nOrbiter\xe2\x80\x99s cargo bay behind the long module.\nIf a mission\xe2\x80\x99s needs can be satisfied with\nonly one segment of the module, the core\nsegment would be used. As many as three\npallets can be installed behind it.\nO r if no habitable module is needed on a\nmission, any number of pallets up to five can\nbe made to fit, one behind the other, in the\nOrbiter\xe2\x80\x99s cargo bay. U p to three adjacent\npallets can be rigidly attached to each other\nto form a \xe2\x80\x9cpallet train\xe2\x80\x9d-for equipment too\nlarge or too heavy to fit on one or two\npallets. When no modules are flown, palletmounted instruments are controlled from the\nOrbiter\xe2\x80\x99s aft flight deck or remotely from the\nground. Present plans call for the use of six\npossible component configurations.\nThe Orbiter-SpaceZabcombination can\nprovide electric power, thermal control and\nalso data collection, recording, processing,\nstorage and transmission as each instrument\nmay require.\nSpaceZab takes advantage of new\npossibilities to widen in-orbit research\nopened by the Space Shuttle that attained\noperational status in 1982. Spacelab pushes\nin-orbit research into broader dimensions.\n\nTUNNEL ADAPTER\n\n6\n\nInternational Pambip-Spacelab\xe2\x80\x98s\nmultinational origin introduces an\nunprecedented international flavor into space\nresearch. Never before have so many nations\nparticipated in any activity aimed exclusively\nat improvement of space investigations. The\n10 European nations that jointly developed\nand paid for Spacelab delivered the modular\nlaboratory to the United States for use by\nNASA as an integral part of the Shuttle. NASA,\nwhich developed and operates the Shuttle\nand all the Spacelab ground and training\nfacilities, has management responsibilities for\nall Spacelab flights. Nations or institutions\nmay rent all or part of Spacelab for one or\n\nCORE MODULE\n\nInstrument-ladenpallet\ninside cargo bayoets wady\nJ5r next misskln.\n\nA\nA\nA\n\nSpacelab m.imen.qg model\nw U-shapedpalleaand\ni\nd\n\nrorodule.\n\npallets can fry in a war\nCOmbiMh.\n.+A\n\nmore flights by paying NASA for the costs of\nthe launch and operation of the mission.\nThese users can then have Spacelab outfitted\nwith their own experiments and operated in\naccordance with their needs. Two nationsWest Germany and Japan-are already\nplanning to rent Spacelabunder this\nreimbursable arrangement. In cooperative\nmissions no money changes hands, but users\nshare research results. This international\naspect of Spacelab operations is intended to\nendure. As planned from the beginning by\nthe contributing European nations and NASA,\nSpacelabwill be used for research by\nexperimenters from the United States,\nEurope, and other countries throughout its\nservice life.\nVmatility-The building block approach, or\nmodular concept, of Spacelab-the option to\nemploy facilities selectively in a wide variety\nof configurations-introduces a flexibility\nnever before available to researchers for inorbit experimentation. Severe limitations in\nsize, weight, power consumption, and data\nhandling traditionally imposed on space\nexperiments are being liberalized by the\nShuttle-Spacelabcombination with its\ncapacity to accommodate a very wide range\nof research needs.\nRetzlrnubility and Reusability-Like its carrier\nship, the Orbiter, Spacelab is returnable from\nspace and reusable. So are the research\ninstruments and specimens aboard. All\ncomponents of Spacelab-the module and\npallets and everything associated with\nthem-are returned to Earth.\nM e r the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s landing, Spacelab\nresearch instruments and equipment and all\nbiological and materials samples are available\nfor study and analysis by each experiment\xe2\x80\x99s\ninvestigators. All equipment and instruments\ncan be sent back into space on subsequent\nflights if desired. Considerable savings are\nachieved by avoiding the need to replace onetime-use equipment, as was necessary earlier.\nThese and other economies make\nexperiments affordable that were formerly\nprohibitively expensive.\nScimztists i Space-Non-career astronaut\nn\nscientists, after as little as 100 hours of\nspecial training in the intricacies of living in\norbit, can travel into space aboard the\nShuttle and conduct research using SpacelaPs\nmade-to-order research facilities. The skills,\nknowledge, and judgment of scientific and\ntechnological specialists who have not\nneeded to spend several years in astronaut\ntraining become available directly for in-orbit\n8\n\ninvestigations in a wide variety of scientific\ndisciplines and technological specialties.\nAs now foreseen, the frequency of Shuttle\nflights (2 in 1981,3 in 1982, and 4 planned\nfor 1983) will gradually increase to perhaps\nas many as 24 each year-an average of 2\neach month in the late 1980s and in the\n1990s. One or two flights each year are\nexpected to be \xe2\x80\x9cdedicated\xe2\x80\x9d Spacelab flights,\nwhich means that cargo bay space and crew\ntime will be devoted almost entirely to the\noperation of Spacelab and its experiments.\n(These figures could change with shifts in\nfuture budget allocations, national priorities,\nor investigators\xe2\x80\x99 demands for Shuttle and\nSpacelab facilities.)\nMany other flights with the new Space\nTransportation System (sTs)-better known\nas Space Shuttle-will carry a Spacelab pallet\nor one or more other Spacelab components.\n\nTkro Pallets Flight-Tested\nIndeed, the Shuttle already has carried two\ntest pallets into orbit-one late in 1981, and\nthe other in 1982. These pallets, essentially\nidentical to the flight models built for future\nmissions, were sent by the European Space\nAgency to the Kennedy Space Center in\nFlorida.\nTwo pallets were on board during the\nsecond and third Shuttle test flights-STS-2,\nNovember 12 to 14, 1981, and STS-3,March\n22 to 30, 1982. These were the first in-orbit\ntests of any major Spacelab elements, also the\nfirst times the Shuttle took any scientific\nresearch equipment with it into orbit other\nthan for measuring its own flight\nperformance. Remarkably successfd research\nresults were obtained with pallet-mounted\ninstruments on STS-2and -3.The pallets, with\ntheir relatively simple electrical power,\ncooling, and command and control functions\nproved to be practical and useful.\nFive Earth-looking research instruments\nweighing a total of a ton were mounted on\nthe test pallet aboard STS-2.They were part of\na pathfinder research packet called OSTA-1,\nan\nacronym denoting that this was an\nexperiment series assembled by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nformer\n\nI\nSL-2will be a\nmdtidkctplline mission with\n13 instrumentson three\npallets and a specialsupport\nJ-tructure.\n\nI\n\nPallet carryin.

These experiments, typical of the\nkinds of apparatus pallets are likely to\nsupport on future flights, were prototypes\ndesigned mainly to calibrate new spaceborne\ninstruments and to determine the\neffectiveness of new techniques for Earth\nresearch from orbital altitudes.\nOSTA-1 instruments verified that it is\npossible with the larger and more powerful\ninstruments mountable on the pallets to\nlocate and identify minerals on Earth, sniff\nout concentrations of carbon monoxide in\nthe lower atmosphere, survey ocean algae\nconcentrations with great accuracy, use radar\nfor Earth surface and sub-surface mapping\nand program Earth observation instruments\nso that they turn themselves on and off\nautomatically as desired, whenever they fly\nabove bare land, vegetation, water, snow, or\nclouds. This last instrument, called FILE\n(Feature Identification and Location\nExperiment), showed that such \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d\nsensors can be automated to make their\nobservations only above certain kinds of\nobjects-eliminating unnecessary recording,\ntransmission, storing, and sorting of vast\nquantities of data unneeded for specific\ninvestigations.\nResearch Introduced Early\nThe use of spacecraft for scientific research\nfollows a tradition that dates back to the very\nbeginning of the United States space\nprogram and has continued without\ninterruption since. The first U.S. satellite,\nExplorer 1, launched on January 31, 1958,\nwas outfitted with three small research\ninstruments which made the first major\nscientific discovery in space.\nAt that time, more than 25 years ago, the\nUnited States was eager to place a satellite\ninto orbit as soon as possible to prove that\nU.S. technology was not trailing that of the\nSoviet Union. Nearly four months earlier, on\nOctober 4,1957, the Soviets placed history\xe2\x80\x98s\nfirst man-made satellite, Sputnik I, in orbit.\nDespite this urgency, U.S.space planners\ninsisted that their satellite serve a purpose\nbeyond merely signaling its presence in orbit.\nThus Explorer 1, despite its relatively small\nsize-15.2 centimeters (6 inches) in diameter\nand 203 centimeters (80 inches) long-and\nits light weight -14 kilograms-carried a\nGeiger counter and two micrometeoroid\ndetectors. These proved sufficient to locate\nradiation belts whose existence until then\nhad only been theorized.\n\n9\n\nNew Discovery Named\nThese phenomena surrounding Earth were\npromptly named Van Allen radiation belts\nafter the University of Iowa physicist, Dr.\nJames A. Van Allen, who had designed the\nexperiment and analyzed its results.\nExplorer 1was rapidly succeeded by\nincreasingly larger, heavier, equipmentcrammed satellites with ever more advanced\ninstruments for astronomy, physics, and\nEarth survey research.\nWith the beginning of manned space flight\nin 1961, science in space took on new\nmeaning. Instead of relying solely on\nautomated, remotely controlled instruments,\npeople could now make their own\nobservations in space and adjust instruments\ndirectly. However, early manned spacecraft\nwere small. Essential flight equipment left\nlittle room for scientific research\ninstruments. This severely restrained early\nspace science, but in their eagerness to\nexplore the newly accessible regions of space,\nscientists found ways to do some research\nwhile fblfilling astronauts\' needs.\nIn 1961 astronauts Alan Shepard and\nVirgil I Grissom, the first Americans in space\nin suborbital flights, and in 1962 John H.\nGlenn, the first American in orbit, wore\nsensors on their chests through which\nphysicians on the ground could\ninstantaneously monitor their heartbeats,\nbreathing rates, and other physical\nparameters during acceleration at launch,\nweightlessness in orbit, and deceleration\nduring reentry in their Mercury spacecraft.\nThe two-man Gemini spacecrafi completed\n10 successful orbital flights within a 20month period in 1965 and 1966. Each craft\'s\ntwo-astronaut crew had about as much living\nspace to share with each other as is available\nin the front seat of a compact car.\nThree-ManCraft Roomier\nThe three-man Apollo spacecraft that\nentered service in 1968 expanded interior\nliving space for astronauts to about the\nvolume of a big station wagon and added\nconsiderably to weight-carrying capacity for\nround trips from Earth to orbit. For the first\ntime in the American space program, it was\npossible for astronauts to get out of their\nseats and their pressure suits and move\naround in their vehicle. In 3 Earth-orbital, 3\naround-the-Moon and 6 Moon-landing\nflights-a total of 12 manned space flights\n\n10\n\nfrom 1968 through 1975 (one of which was\nthe Apollo Soyuz mission)-plus three\nSkylab missions, the Apollo spacecrafi made\nmilestone contributions to nearly every field\nof science and technology.\nTwo-man teams of astronaut explorers in\nthe six Moon landings carried out geological\nfield trips on the lunar surface, gathered\nsamples of lunar rocks and soil for return to\nEarth, and set up geophysical research\nstations containing a variety of instruments.\nThese units continued to radio data to Earth\nlong after the astronauts had left the Moon.\nThe Moon flights were the first to take\nhumans away from the direct influence of\nEarth and showed that they could survive and\ndo useful work on another world.\n\nApollo Does Extra Research\nScientific and technological research with\na manned spacecrafi had reached another\nhigh point during the period from May 1973\nthrough February 1974.That period included\nthe three manned missions with Skylab, an\norbital craft the size of a small threebedroom house-by far the largest spacecraft\nlaunched by the United States-and a direct\nancestor of Spacelab.\nThree astronaut crews, aboard three\nseparate Apollo craft, rendezvoused in turn\nwith Skylab in Earth orbit, linked their\nApollo to Skylab\'s docking port, and entered\nand worked inside the orbiting laboratoryfor nearly a month in the visit by the first\ncrew, nearly two months during the second\ncrew\'s stay, and about three months in the\nthird crew\'s visit. The relatively large size of\nSkylab provided ample interior working and\nliving space and, for the first time, allowed\nastronauts to work in orbit with bulky\nequipment, including several large Sun\ntelescopes, hrnaces for melting metals in\n\nwith utrgo 6.r dams closecl,\nSpacelabis Obscured*\n!mt m"-Fpcpdfimn\nsearind heat, durind\nM\n~ reentty and\ns\nhndind.\n\n*\n\nweightlessness, and other apparatus for\nIt was Space Shuttle with its ability to\nbring back to Earth 14,500kilograms\nprocessing alloys, composites and other\n(32,000 pounds) of cargo that made Spacelab\nsubstances.\nSkylab was msabh but not returnable.The possible.\nthree crews did, in fact, use it three times,\nSpacelab is designed to exploit the Shuttle\'s\nleaving it vacant from 36 to 52 days between potentialities to the hllest as a vehicle for\nvisits.

Ability to bring instruments and\nsystems under differing conditions, using a\nresearch samples back to Earth was very\nvariety of scientific and technological\nlimited. Skylab eventually fell back into the\nexperiments. The first is a module-plus-pallet\natmosphere afier its orbit decayed and,\nconfigration while the second is a pallet-only\nexcept for a few pieces of debris which fell on configuration.

These first flights and early ones to\nThe only Skylab objects returned had to be\nfollow are expected to last from 7 to 1 days\n0\nloaded into limited space in one of the\neach. While mission objectives and the types\nvisiting Apollo craft with their relatively\nof experiments change with each flight,\nprocedures for returning home remain\nsmall payload capacity.\nunchanged.\nShortly before the end of a Spacelab flight,\nthe mission specialists and payload specialists\nreturn from the module through the tunnel\nto the Orbiter mid deck. A mission specialist\nflips switch R-13\ninto reverse. The big cargo\nbay doors close. Latches reengage. The\nprotective doors now shield Spacelab from\nthe searing heat and friction of reentry and\nlanding.\n\nMuch Data Returns to Earth\nBack on Earth, Spacelab is removed from\nthe cargo bay, freeing the Orbiter for other\nassignments. Films, recordings, biological\nspecimens, and material samples are removed\nand given to the appropriate researchers for\nanalysis.\nMost of the information generated by\nresearch instruments already has been\ntransmitted to Earth during the flight via\nradio communication links.\nThe research equipment, like the Orbiter\nand Spacelab themselves, is reusable and can\nlater be sent back into space if desired.\nSpacelab\'s module and pallets are outfitted\nwith new sets of research instruments and\nsupplies. Requirements of the next mission\nmay call for a different configuration of\ncomponents than was used last. Spacelab is\nreassembled in the chosen configuration and\ninserted into the cargo bay of one of the\norbiters of NASA\'s Shuttle fleet. The space\nscience laboratory is ready for its next trip\ninto orbit.\n\nccc,\n-\n\nand\nJ m t k ! Wehometo\nSpacelab! This is the md\nthing; Not a mochp.\nNot a npliia.

It is near the\nturn of the century-perhaps 15 years from\nthe first Spacelali flight in 1983. One of the\ntwo sets of Spacelab components-a long\nmodule and five pallets and various units of\nauxiliary equipment-is now part of the Air\nand Space Museum\xe2\x80\x99s permanent \xe2\x80\x9cMilestonesof-Manned-Flight\xe2\x80\x9d exhibit.\nThe other identical set of Spacelab\ncomponents joined the permanent collection\nof a major museum in Europe. In addition to\ntheir normal Shuttle use both sets had put in\nshort tours as experimental research and\napplication modules with the U.S. space\nstation launched in the 1990s. The modules,\nloaded with experiments, were repeatedly\ntaken into orbit aboard the Shuttle and\nstayed there attached to the space station for\nperiods up to three months. The modules\nwere then returned to Earth by the Shuttle,\nunloaded, re-equipped with other\nexperiments, and launched once again for\nmore research at the space station.\nThis scenario is imaginary, of course.\nFigures given by the fictitious tour guide are\nmerely projections and extrapolations. So are\nall of the statements about the two sets of\nSpace&&. But if the expectations of the\nEuropean builders and NASA operators of\nSpacehb materialize, its history may closely\nparallel this scenario and these figures.\nThe first Spacelab-built and hnded in\nEurope-is complete and ready for service\nbeginning in late 1983. The second Spacelab\nis being purchased by NASA from its\nEuropean builders and is expected to be\nready for service in 1985. Each of these\nSpacelabs is designed for as many as 50\nmissions.\nWhen these Spacehbs are eventually retired\nto become museum exhibits, they will differ\nin some important ways from earlier displays\nof the relics of manned space flight.\nTourists cannot wander into the earliest\nhabitable enclosures flown in outer spaceMercury, Gemini, the Apollo command\nmodule, and the Apollo lunar landing\nmodule, which were the first U.S. manned\nspacecraft. All are far too small for sightseers\nto enter. Most of the units on museum\ndisplay are sealed, but have transparent walls\nor windows through which visitors can look\ninside. Skylab, the largest U.S. habitable space\nenclosure, is big enough so that groups of\nvisitors do walk through it at the National\n\n13\n\nAir and Space Museum\xe2\x80\x99s display. But Skylab\n(like the lunar module) was abandoned in\nspace after its usefulness was exhausted. The\nflight unit is gone. Exhibits are made up of\nunflown duplicates or mockups.\n\nAll of Spacelab Returnable\nNot so with Spacelab. Every part of it-and\neverything it carries with it-comes back to\nthe Earth after each flight. In the words of\nthe fictitious museum guide, \xe2\x80\x9cthe real thing\xe2\x80\x9d\nwith all its furnishings and auxiliary\nequipment can go on display once the units\nare withdrawn from flight duty. There is\nample room for small groups of tourists to\ngather in its interior.\nSpacelab\xe2\x80\x99s long module-7 meters (23 feet)\nlong and 4 meters (13 feet) in diametercombines the core and experiment segments\nand has the dimensions of a medium-size\nhouse trailer. Its 5.4-meter-long ( 18-foot)\ncenter aisle is a suitable place for the tour to\nbegin.\n\nLong module and pallet\nbeing readied@ l a i g\nodn\ninto the Orbitds cay0 bay\nat the Kennedy Spme\nC n w in Floria\xe2\x80\x99u.\net\n\n14\n\nWhat the museum visitors see from the\naisle looks much like the scene in other\nmodern research laboratories: Walls are lined\nwith the standard 48-centimeter-wide ( 19inch) laboratory racks containing custommade instruments and equipment. One sees\nswitches, status indication lights, intercom\nstations, keyboards, several display screens.\nThere is a workbench for making minor\nequipment repairs and adjustments. It looks\nlike a lectern and will be used also as a\nwriting desk.\nStowed in racks and overhead ceiling bins,\nresembling the storage compartments above\npassenger seats in planes and trains, are\ncommon laboratory supplies and utensilsfilm, magnetic tape, cameras, test tubes, lab\ncultures, material samples, spare parts,\nlubricants, and repair tools, including\nwrenches of different sizes, screwdrivers,\nknives.\nYet any notion that this is an ordinary\nlaboratory is quickly dispelled. Even\n\nsightseers unfamiliar with research\ninstallations notice that this is an unusual\nfacility. Handrails are within easy reach from\nany location. So are foot restraints. Items in\nthe stowage racks are surrounded by foam\nfiller. Test tubes are closed to keep fluids\nfrom floating away. There are no doors. The\nentrance is a tunnel (which has been removed\nalong with the end cone, to permit tourist\naccess).\nThis is a laboratory adapted for work in\nweightlessness.\nMobility aids such as rails and restraints\nare needed for comfort and safety in an\nenvironment in which the reaction from\nclosing a drawer or stomping a foot can send\na crew member gliding through the air.\nUnattached objects must be fastened to\nprevent them from floating away and causing\ninjury or damage.\n\nTesting research inrtrumts\nat labmatmy m s imide\nk\nmodule, two technicianr\nwear protective clothing to\navdcontaminatimt of\nequi$tnent.Note vertical\nrailinngssfbrcrew3 use in\nweikhthsnm.\n\nSpacelab d u l e in\nprepanztimtfiflight in\nOperatMlzr and Checkottt\nBuildin$, Kennedy Space\nCenter, Florida.

It houses the console of the\nControl and Data Management System\n(CDMS) which is for all practical purposes the\nbrain and nerve center of Spacelab. Its\nkeyboard and video display are the crew\xe2\x80\x98s\ninterface with SpaceWs systems. Here the\ncrew obtains readouts informing them of the\nstatus of Spacehb\xe2\x80\x98s systems and experiments.\nHere too the crew can command the\ncomputers and operate many of the\nexperiments within the module and on the\npallet. And here too the crew can adjust the\ncabin temperature, switch communication\nmodes and do trouble shooting when\nneeded.\nIn the first double rack on the rightdirectly across the aisle from the CDMS\ncontrols-are the work bench-desk assembly\nand also the computers which are controlled\nfrom the CDMS.\nWith these first two double racks taken up\nby controls and computers, only two double\nracks and two single racks remain available in\nthe core segment for experiments. In the\nexperiment segment, all racks are available\nfor experiment instruments and equipment.\nAll racks are independently attached to the\nfloor and overhead structure. Racks not\nneeded on a particular mission can be\nremoved. Up to 290 kilograms ( 6 4 5 pounds)\nof equipment and instruments can be\ninstalled in each single rack, up to 580\nkilograms (1,290 pounds) in each double\nrack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\nI-\n\nScientifi airlock in the\nceiling o the experiment\nf\nreptent allows exposure and\nretrieval o experiments to\nf\nouter space without requiring crew members to leave\nenclosures.\n\n1\xe2\x80\x98\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n16\n\n4\n\nRacks are tested again after\narrival at the Kennedy\nSpace Centev, Florida.\n\nLookina straight up in the\ncow module, as the camera\ndid hem, a visitor sees two\nwindows in the ceiling\nthmugh which crew\nmembers can make\na s m m i c a l and Earth\nobsewations.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nn\n\nI\n\nF-\n\nI\xe2\x80\x98\n\nInstruments and equipment are\nthoroughly tested before being lifted into\nand installed in the module and on the\npallets. Then, the entire Spacela&assembly as\nneeded for a misssion-module, pallets, and\nthe instruments and equipment they carryare jointly tested to assure their\ncompatibility. Only then, after they have been\nchecked out together, are the hlly loaded\nmodules and pallets installed in the cargo\nbay, thus keeping the Orbiter free for other\nassignments as long as possible and reducing\nits turn-around time, the period between its\nlanding and next launch.\nLooking up, the visitor notices that the\noverhead storage lockers are interrupted\ntwice, first by windows in the ceiling of the\n\nVideo/lntercom/Keyboard\nStowage\nExperiment Power Switching\nPanel(s) and Access\nLife Sciences\nExperiments\n\nhthmojxmh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x997\n\ncore segment, and second by a large\nprotruding cylinder in the ceiling of the\nexperiment segment on which a tall visitor\nwho is not carefill might bump his head.\n\nView from Module Limited\nThese windows-plus another set at the\nrear end cone-provide the only outside view\nfor crews in the Spacelab modules. Without\nthese windows life inside Spacelab would be\nmuch like working in a submerged\nsubmarine. The windows can be used for\ncelestial and terrestrial observations.\nOne of the windows in the ceiling\nassembly is rectangular, measuring 41 by 55\ncentimeters (16 by 21.5 inches), and is called\nthe high-quality window because it is made\nof nearly distortion-free, low-reflectiveglass\nfor observations requiring great precision.\nTemperature sensors on this window warn\ncrews of the glass\xe2\x80\x99s overheating due to\nexcessive sun exposure.\nThe other window in the assembly is 30\ncentimeters (12 inches) in diameter and is\nmade of conventional glass containing a\nheater film coating to prevent foggirg from\ncondensation. Through it the crew \xe2\x80\x98makes\nobservations and takes photographs\nrequiring less precision.\nWhen the windows are not in use, the crew\ncan protect the entire assembly from\nmicrometeoroid impacts, contamination, and\noverheating with covers that can be\ncontrolled from inside the modules. In flight,\ncrew members can look through the aft end\ncone\xe2\x80\x99s viewport onto the pallets and the\ninstruments mounted there.\n\nSpacelab-l mdule in the\ncheckout&ility at the\nKennedy Space Center in\nFlmida.\n\nAirlock Chamber Provided\nThe large cylinder in the ceiling opening in\nthe experiment segment contains an airlock\nthrough which the crew can expose\ninstruments and specimens directly to outer\nspace. They can be retrieved later without any\ncrew member having to go outside the\nmodule.\nThe airlock is a cylinder one meter (3.3\nfeet) long and one meter wide. It is closed by\nhatches at both ends. Experiments to be\nexposed to space are attached by the crew to\na sliding table that can carry loads of up to\n100 kilograms (220 pounds). The airlock\xe2\x80\x98s\ninner hatch has a small viewport for\nmonitoring the exposed experiment. It takes\nthe crew about 10 minutes to drain the air\nfrom the airlock before exposure of samples\nor instruments to the vacuum of space.\nAbout 15 minutes are needed to repressurize\n\nr\n\nThe enJineerin8 model, a\nreplica of theflight unit, is\nhoisted onto a work stand\n(top) at the Opemtims and\nCheckout Building at the\nKennedy Spme Centq\nwhew engineen and\ntechnicians then pvactice\ninstalling equipment\n(middle).Aftw it was\nassembled i Bretnen, West\nn\nGemtany, the m e was\ndl\ntestzd thew (bonum)\nbe@re\nbein8 shipped to the fiited\nStates.

Several repressurizations are\npossible on each SpaceZab flight with the\nsupply of nitrogen aboard the module.\nIf no airlock is needed, the window\nassembly from the core segment can be\ninstalled in the airlock opening in the\nexperiment segment. Otherwise, the ceiling\nopening is closed with a cover plate. (The\nairlock cannot be mounted in the coresegment opening.)\nSome important features of SpLlEelab are\nnot readily discernible during a casual visit.\nAmong these less obvious items are the\nintricate systems that keep the atmosphere\nclean and the humidity and temperature\ncomfortable for the crew.\nWater and air flow through the cooling\nloops of S p m W s environmental control\nsystem, carrying away heat generated by the\nbodies of crew members, by the extensive\nelectronic equipment, and by other\ninstruments within the module. Because air\ndoes not circulate by itself in weightlessness\nas it does on the Earth, where warm air rises\nand colder air sinks, air must be forced under\npressure through the equipment racks and\nother portions of the module.\nSpatelab temperatures are kept even with\nthe help of a passive environmental control\nsystem, which consists of many layers of foilcovered Mylar with a vacuum between layers.\nSpecial paint on the outside helps ward off\nWbmfrwrpanehare\nmodule,\nremDped in the h .\nutility sysa?m i d h t i m s\nare qosed.

During launch and landing, when the\ndoors are closed, the loops unload their heat\nto the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s flash evaporators, which boil\noff ammonia. Water evaporators in the\nOrbiter augment the system in orbit when\nthe radiators cannot dissipate the total heat\nload.\nSome of the cooling loops (air ducts and\nfluid lines) run under the module\xe2\x80\x99s floor.\nElectric power, communications, data\ntransmission, and other utility lines are also\nlocated there. Some underfloor storage space\nfor equipment and supplies is available in the\nexperiment segment. Some floor panels are\nremovable in both segments. Thus crew\nmembers have limited access to the subfloor\nspace for adjustments and minor repairs, for\nchanging the lithium hydroxide canisters for\ncarbon dioxide removal, and for retrieving\nitems stored in the experiment segment\xe2\x80\x99s\nunderfloor bins.\nInstruments and equipment requiring\nextra cooling in the equipment racks inside\nthe module or on pallets can be\naccommodated with \xe2\x80\x9ccold plates\xe2\x80\x9d that can be\nattached to such instruments. Each cold plate\nis made up of a pair of metal sheets forming\na sandwich around tubes through which\ncoolants are cycled.\nThe environmental control system provides\nan atmosphere for SpaceWs crew inside the\nmodule with the same air pressure and\ncomposition as at sea level-14.7 pounds per\nsquare inch ( 10.1 Newtons per square\ncentimeter) with approximately 20 percent\noxygen and 80 percent nitrogen-and with\nroom temperatures which the crew can set to\ntheir own liking. Oxygen is supplied by the\nOrbiter. The module carries its own nitrogen\nsupply. The atmosphere is continuously\nstrained through the lithium hydroxide\ncanisters to remove carbon &oxide and\noccasionally is also cycled through a scrubber\n\n19\n\nto remove contaminants. A vent assembly in\n\nthe forward end cone expels noxious fumes\nfrom experiments directly into space. The\nassembly\xe2\x80\x99s hose can be connected with the\nexperiment chambers in the racks to vent\nundesirable gases into the vacuum outside.\n\n7 Technicians at work on the\nI Erst Spacelabflight unit.\n\ne.\nC\n\nr\n\nFuel Cells Furnish %wer\nDespite the abundance of sunshine in\nspace, the Orbiter and Spacelab do not draw\nany power from solar cells. None are aboard.\nInstead, electricity is generated aboard the\nOrbiter by three fuel cells, one of which is\nentirely devoted to Spacelab.

For Spacelab operations fuel cells are\nadvantageous because the crew is free to\nposition the Orbiter to suit research needs\nfor astronomical or Earth observations,\nrather than having to move the Orbiter so\nthat its solar cells face toward the Sun for\nextended periods to charge its batteries. Fuelcell-generated electricity from the Orbiter is\ndistributed to Spacelab outlets in the module\nwork areas, the equipment racks, and at the\npallets to operate the instruments and\nequipment there. The water that is produced\nby the fuel cell chemical reaction is used for\nfood preparation, drinking, and evaporative\ncooling.\nPower also goes to SpmeZab\'s three\ncomputers-one for supervision of the\nexperiments, another for controlling\nSpaceWs own housekeeping, and the third as\na backup for immediate substitution if either\nof the others fail.\nMuseum visitors can stand at a video\nscreen of the Control Center console and\nwatch a payload specialist operate the\nkeyboard while SpaceZab information appears\non the screen. The watcher can get a quicklook analysis on the screen about any Spacelab\nexperiment-Is it turned on?W h a t results is\nit getting?Are there any problems? If so,\nwhat are they? Besides acquiring this and\nother information and making it available to\nthe crew, Spacelab\'s on-board computers also\nsupervise the multiplexing of the various\ncommunication channels into a single data\nstream, activate the high data-rate and video\nrecorders, and command transmission to\nEarth.\nThe computers operate some experiments\nvirtually without human intervention,\nadjusting deviant instruments back to\n\naccuracy within split seconds. They flash a\nwarning if assistance from the crew is\nrequired or if an emergency should appear to\nbe imminent. Crew members can enter new\ninstructions into the computers and also\noverride its decisions.\nSixteen Data Channels Available\nThe computer-associated mass memory\ncan store 132 million bits of data, a quantity\nwhich, if it were all stored in words, would\nbe the equivalent of 27 thick books. The\ncomputers and the rest of the Control and\nData Management System (CDMS) operate\nseparately from the Orbiter data\nmanagement installations, thus making the\nCDMS the most independent of all major\nsystems aboard Spacelab. However, for\ntransmissions to Earth, the CDMS depends\nentirely on the Orbiter\'s communications\nsystem. All of SpmeZab\'s communications and\ndata transmissions go through the Orbiter.\nOne of the key devices for feeding data to\nthe Orbiter\'s communications system is a\nvery advanced multiplexer which combines\n16 channels of instrument information and\ntwo voice channels for simultaneous\ntransmission. A crew member in the Orbiter\ncan carry on a conversation with Earth while\nanother crew member in the module talks to\nthe Earth on another voice channel. At the\nsame time, 16 research instruments aboard\nSpaceZab can report their condition and their\nresearch results to Earth.\nFor transmission the Orbiter uses the new\nSatellite Tracking and Data Relay Satellite\nSystem (TDRSS). When completed, that\nsystem\'s transmission of data, voice and\ntelevision from the Orbiter can be raised to a\nrate at which, if the transmissions were all in\nalphabet characters, would equal nearly a\nmillion words-or 10 full-length novelsmoving from space to Earth each second.\nWith the full TDRSS in operation, contact can\nbe maintained with Mission Control at least\n30 to 80 percent of the time.\n\n21\n\nTunnel Provides Module Access\nAt the front end of the module in the\ncenter of the end cone-between the double\nracks holding the Control Center and the\nworkbench-desk-is the entrance to the\ntunnel that leads to the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s mid deck.\nThe tunnel, the only major in-orbit\ncomponent of Spacelab supplied by NASA,\ncomes in two lengths to permit positioning\nthe modules closer or farther away from the\nOrbiter\xe2\x80\x99s flight and mid decks.

Some flights call for such EVAS\nto carry out experiments in the vacuum of\nspace. Unscheduled EVAS can become\nnecessary, for maintenance and repair work\non pallet-mounted instruments, or on the\ncargo bay doors\xe2\x80\x99 closing mechanisms, or on\nother Orbiter or Spacela&components.\nIn pallet-only missions-when no module\nis on board-a vertical drum, 2.4 meters\n\nI\n\nhigh and weighing 630 kilograms ( 1,400\npounds) is attached to the forward pallet to\nprovide services otherwise offered by the\nmodules. The drum is called an \xe2\x80\x9cigloo\xe2\x80\x9d and\nmaintains the same interior temperature and\natmosphere as a module. The igloo contains\nnecessary power-distribution, command and\ndata equipment and other utility resources to\nserve pallet instruments. In the pallet-only\nconfiguration, the research instruments and\nutility installations are controlled from the\nOrbiter\xe2\x80\x98s aft flight deck or from the ground.\nSpecial services for experiments which\nrequire them can be made available by the\nOrbiter-Spmelab system. For example,\ntelescopes often need to be kept pointed for\nrelatively long periods with extraordinary\nprecision at very faint, extremely distant\ncelestial targets. The Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s maneuvering\nability using the thrusters of the reaction\ncontrol system rarely exceeds an accuracy\nbetter than one-half a degree and often\ncomes within only two degrees of accuracyroughly equal to holding an instrument on\nthe Earth pointed at the full disk of the\nMoon.\n\nI\nThe rme-ton Instrument\nPointin8 System\nmanu&tured in Europe is\nused on palleh w h m w\ntelescopes need to bejkused\nuithgwatpvecision.

Weighing about\na ton, the IPS is installed on a pallet whenever\nit is needed on a mission, to focus\ninstruments on their targets with an accuracy\nwithin 1.2 arc-seconds. This is equal to\nkeeping an instrument on the Capitol steps\nin Washington, D.C., aimed at a dime-size\ncoin at theLincoln Memorial 3.6 kilometers\n(2%\nmiles) away. The IPS keeps instruments\non target even when crew movements or\nequipment operations cause the Orbiter to\nvibrate. The IPS can be programmed to work\nautomatically or it can be controlled from\nthe Orbiter\'s flight deck. As a safety\nprecaution in the event that the IPS cannot be\nretracted and restowed after use, thus\npreventing the cargo bay doors from closing\nfor reentry, the entire IPS can be jettisoned\ninto space, as can the airlock outer hatch if it\nshould fail to retract.\nTo avoid flying over land areas during early\nascent, flights launched from Kennedy Space\nCenter in Florida are not sent into orbits\nwith an inclination steeper than 57 degrees.\nHowever, this permits orbital paths that\nbring Spacelab far enough north to cover all\nof the United States, the southern half of\nCanada, all of Central Europe and all except\nthe most northerly parts of Asia-and far\nenough south to pass over all the major land\nmasses in the Southern Hemisphere except\nAntarctica.

Like riders on a bus\nor airliner, they leave the operation of the\nvehicle to professional drivers. While these\npayload specialists concern themselves with\nthe conduct of their in-space scientific\nexperiments, the navigation and other\noperational tasks for the Orbiter and\nSpacelab are handled by the career astronauts\nin the crew.\nPayload specialists are new to NASA.

Young at age 53 easily qualifies for\nthe title of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most experienced\nspace traveler. He has been a hll-time\nastronaut for 21 years. He has flown in a\nrecord five space flights-in three of these as\ncommander-in three generations of\nspacecraft, spending a total of 27 days in\nspace. That total includes three days of living\non the surface of the Moon.\nSL-1 is Young\xe2\x80\x99s sixth flight into space, his\nfourth as commander, and the mission will\nmake him the first person to fly a second\ntime on three kinds of spacecraft. He was the\ncommander of the Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s first orbital\nflight, STS-1, April 12 to 14,1981.\nBorn in San Francisco on September 24,\n1930, Young grew up in Orlando, Florida,\nwhere his parents still live. He earned a\nbachelor of science degree with highest\nhonors in aeronautical engineering from\nGeorgia Institute of Technology in 1952. He\njoined the U.S. Navy and, as a Navy test pilot,\nset world time-to-climb records to 3,000 and\n25,000-meter altitudes in 1962, just before\nhe was selected as an astronaut in September\nof that same year.\nHe was on two separate orbital flights in\nthe two-man Gemini spacecraft (Gemini 3 in\n1965 and Gemini 10 as commander in 1966)\nand on two separate flights in the three-man\nApollo-Apollo 10, which orbited the Moon\n31 times in May 1969, and Apollo 16, which\nachieved landing on the Moon in April 1972.\nAs commander of that last flight, Young and\na colleague collected 90 kilograms (200\npounds) of Moon rocks during 20 hours of\nscientific explorations in which they walked\nand drove in the lunar roving vehicle for 43\nkilometers (27 miles) through the rugged\nlunar highlands.

He has been an astronaut since\nJanuary 1978. sL-1 is his first space flight. A\nnative of Michigan, he earned bachelor and\nmaster of science degrees in engineering\nmechanics from the University of Wisconsin\nat Madison in 1968 and 1969 before joining\nthe Air Force.\nMission Specialist\nDr.Owen K. Garriot?, 52, one of the two\nsL-1 mission specialists, is one of NASA\'s most\nexperienced scientist-astronauts. Though\nstationed at the Johnson Space Center in\nHouston, Texas, as a full-time member of the\nastronaut corps for more than 18 years, he\nstill retains his consulting professorship at\nStanford University in California, where he\ntaught electronics, electromagnetic theory,\nand ionospheric physics from 1961 until he\nbecame an astronaut in 1965. He has done\nextensive research in ionospheric physicsstudies of the upper atmosphere-and has\npublished a book and 30 scientific papers in\nthis field.\nGarriott lived in orbit continuously for\n59% days from July 28 to September 25,\n1973, as a member of the second three-man\ncrew that occupied Skylab, the 100-tonU.S.\norbital research space station. On that\nmission Garriott spent a total of 13 hours\nand 43 minutes working outside S&ylabon\nthree separate space walks.\nA native of Enid, Oklahoma, where his\nparents still live, he earned a bachelor of\nscience degree in electrical engineering from\nthe University of Oklahoma in 1953. He\nreceived a master of science degree in 1957\nand a doctorate in electrical engineering in\n1960, both from Stanford University. He\nserved as an electronics officer in the U.S.\nNavy from 1953 to 1956, and has logged\nmore than 3,900 hours piloting aircrafi. He\ninterrupted his astronaut activities, serving\nbriefly as director of applications and\nassistant director for space science at the\nJohnson Space Center, before going into\nmission specialist training.\n\n30\n\nMission Specialist\nDr. &bertA.R Parker, 46, Garriott\'s\ncolleague as sL-1 mission specialist, has also\nbeen a member of a college faculty. He was\nan associate professor of astronomy at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin until his selection as\nan astronaut in 1967. Though he has been in\ntraining as an astronaut for 16 years, sL-1 is\nhis first space flight. He grew up in\nShrewsbury, Massachusetts, where his\nparents still live.

Lampton of the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, whose research had\nencompassed space physics, X-ray and\nultraviolet astronomy, and optical and\nelectronics engineering.\nThe ESA selection process began in\nDecember 1977 when ESA in consultation\nwith the European scientists who were then\nbuilding sL-1 experiments announced the\nselection of three payload specialist\ncandidates from more than 2,000 European\napplicants: Merbold; Dr. Wubbo Ockels, a\nnuclear physicist from the University of\nGroningen, the Netherlands; and Dr. Claude\nNicollier, a Swiss astronomer.\nThe five began preparing for the mission\nby acquainting themselves with the\nexperiments and with the SpmZab\ncomponents and systems, all of which were\nunder construction.\nWhile Spacelab was being built in Europe,\nthe Shuttle, being built in the United States,\nwas encountering problems with the heatprotective tiles that cover its underside and\nPayhad S p e d & fi.Ulf\nMerbold trains bimsevfi\nwork w t meamb\nih\n\n-c;\n\nwith the performance of its revolutionary\nnew rocket engines. These problems delayed\nthe Shuttle\'s readiness for flight, giving the\npayload specialist candidates unexpected\nextra time for training. They also were able\nto return occasionally to their jobs at their\nlaboratories for several weeks at a time\nbetween their payload specialist preparations,\nuntil their intensive full-time training began\nin January 1982.\nMeanwhile, Nicollier was assigned by ESA\nto mission specialist training at the Johnson\nSpace Center. Thus he was no longer a\ncontender for the payload specialist\nassignments, leaving the European\ncompetition to Merbold and Ockels.\nThe four (Lichtenberg, Lampton,\nMerbold, and Ockels), together with the two\nmission specialists, traveled and met most of\nthe more than 70 sL-1 principal investigators\nin the United States, Europe, and Japan.\nThey learned from them the details of these\nexperiments, how to operate and adjust\nthem, and how to make corrections if\nnecessary for almost every conceivable\ncontingency.\nThen the four payload specialists, together\nwith the mission specialists, began training\nin the Space&& Payload Crew Training\nComplex at the Marshall Space Flight\nCenter. The model\'s interior closely\nresembles the interior of the sL-1 module.\nThe candidates became acquainted with the\nexperiment arrangements in the racks and\nthe other module facilities. They practiced\nconducting experiments simultaneously and\nin prescribed sequences, simulating in-flight\nroutines. Computer facilities simulated\nexperiment results, and candidates practiced\nmonitoring, interpreting, and responding to\nthem.\nVariety of Training Provided\nIn nonstop training sessions that kept the\ncandidates inside the module more than 12\nhours each day, they became accustomed to\nthe sL-1 work routine, which calls for two 12hour shifts so as to keep sL-1 in operation on\na continuous 24-hour-a-day\nbasis during the\nflight. On the mission either the commander\nor pilot is on duty on the flight deck at all\ntimes, and one mission specialist and one\n\nI\nh\n\n33\n\npayload specialist are on duty in either the\nmodule or on the flight deck, while the other\nthree crew members sleep or relax until they\ntake their turns on a 12-hour shift.\nThe payload crew (both mission and\npayload specialists) were taken on flights in\nKC-135 aircraft in which weightlessness is\njet\nsimulated for up to 30 seconds at a time by\noperating the craft in parabolic curves to\ncreate a situation resembling the sensation\none feels for a few seconds in a very fastdescending elevator. During such brief\nperiods of weightlessness the candidates\npracticed eating, drinking, and using various\nutensils as they would later in the Orbiter\nand the Spacelab module. The payload and\nmission specialists trained in the Orbiter\nmodel at the Johnson Space Center to\nacquaint themselves with the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s flight\nand mid decks and to practice living in them.\nOn September 30 and October 1,1982,\nthe IWG held a historic meeting at the\nMarshall Center to review all science aspects\nof the sL-1 flight. By the end of that meeting\nthe group had also made the crucial final\nselection of their own sL-1in-flight\nrepresentative. With the approval of NASA\nthey had selected Lichtenberg for the prime\ncrew and Lampton as the alternate for the\nsL-1 payload specialists positions. The\nalternate provides scientific support to the\nmission from the Payload Operations\nControl Center while the flight is in\nprogress. Meanwhile Merbold was chosen by\nESA for the prime and Ockels as the alternate.\nThus the researchers who designed and\nbuilt the experiments, and who are to analyze\nthe results, helped select from their peers the\ntwo in-flight specialists who are to be in\ncharge of carrying out research in orbit.\nCrew Can Total Seven\nThe sL-1 six-man crew will be exceeded\nsoon. Crews of seven are expected to be\nassigned to some SpaceZab flights.\nOn each of the two Shuttle flights\npreceding Spacehb-1-STS-7 and sTs-8-a\nphysician was added to the crews. As flight\ncrews grow in numbers, the inclusion of a\nphysician becomes logical to tend to the\nhealth of the crew, provide care in the event\nof illness or accident, carry out studies on the\nimpact of prolonged weightlessness on the\nhuman system, and, particularly, to extend\nthe continuing investigations of motion\nsickness to which SL-1 is expected to make\nmajor contributions.\nSending Ph.D.\xe2\x80\x99s and physicians into space\nceased long ago to be a novelty. Except for\n34\n\nthe very earliest manned space flights, such\nassignments have been common in the U.S.\nspace program. The first American Ph.D. in\nAldrin, Jr.,\nspace was Edwin E. (\xe2\x80\x9cBUZZ\xe2\x80\x9d)\nthen 36, who made his first space flight in\nNovember 1966 aboard the Gemini 12. It\nwas the last mission of the 10-flight series\nwith the two-man Gemini spacecraft, and\nAldrin, who had written his doctoral\ndissertation on orbital mechanics, made\nlandmark contributions toward achieving\nthat flight\xe2\x80\x99s objective of going into formation\nflight-\xe2\x80\x9crendezvous\xe2\x80\x9d-with\nan unmanned\norbiting Agena craft and then linking up\xe2\x80\x9cdocking\xe2\x80\x9d-with it. Aldrin was the second\nperson in history-and the first Ph.D.-to\nwalk on the Moon. He had earned his\ndoctorate in astronautics at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology in\n1963 and had been in the U.S. Atr Force\nwhere he became a colonel.\nThe distinction of being the first working\nscientist to walk on the Moon went to Dr.\nHarrison H. Schmitt, then 37, who became\nthe last of the 12 U.S. astronauts who visited\nthe Moon. The Apollo 17 flight in which he\nparticipated in December 1972 ended the sixflight series of Moon landing missions.\nSchmitt, who later served a term as a U.S.\nsenator from New Mexico (1977-1983),had\nreceived his doctorate in geology from\nHarvard University in 1964, a year before he\nbecame an astronaut. He had worked for the\nNorwegian Geological Survey in Oslo,\nNorway, and for the U.S. Geological Survey\n( USGS) in New Mexico, Montana, and\nSouthwestern Alaska and also for the USGS\nAstrogeology Branch as a project chief for\nphoto and telescopic mapping of the Moon.\nMainly because of this last experience he had\nbeen assigned by the uscs-before he himself\nbecame an astronaut-as an instructor for\nMoon-bound astronauts preparing for\ngeological field trips and the collection of\ngeological samples.\n\nMedical Specialist Flown\nThe first American physician in space was\nDr. Joseph I?. Kenvin, then 41, who was a\nmember of the first of three crews who\nvisited Skylab, the house-size, 100-ton U.S.\nspace station.\nHe and two astronaut companions lived in\nthat station in orbit for 28 days from May 25\n\nto June 22,1973. Kenvin had been adde\n\nS\n\nthe Skylab crew because of the increasing\nawareness at that time of new opportunities\nfor medical research in weightl&ness which\ncould contribute to the understanding of the\nhuman system on the Earth.\nSkyhb\xe2\x80\x99s roominess made possible thorough\nphysical examinations of astronauts in orbit\nfor the first time, and Dr. Kenvin took\n\nWnghtlemss tj a c h e d J\n%\na @ secunds i& a\nKC-135 ainrafjl\xe2\x80\x99ng in a\nparabolic curve.

Garriott\n(who is mentioned earlier in the chapter), a\nmember of the second Skylab crew in the\nmid-1970s and now a mission specialist in\nthe sL-1 crew.\n\nScience Specialists Needed\nThe selection of science specialists came a$\na result of an increasing realization at the - 3\n2\ntime that the ranks of the early test-pilot\n?\nastronauts would have to be augmented by 7\xe2\x80\x99\nexperienced scientists if the research\nopportunities of the new system were to be\nfully exploited.\nThe new scientist-astronauts had to\nabandon their scientific positions to enter\nfull-time astronaut training at the Johnson\nSpace Center. Each of them had to spend\nseveral years learning the operation and\nhandling of spacecrafi, and they had to share\nin spacecrafi operational tasks and other inflight chores as full members of the flight\ncrew. The full extent of the preflight training\nrequired of scientist-astronauts is illustrated\nby the fact that Kenvin and Garriott had\nbeen full-time astronauts for eight years and\nSchmitt for seven years before they made\ntheir first space flights.\n\nTraining T m Reduced\nie\nIn contrast, today\xe2\x80\x99s Spacehb payload\nspecialists need to undergo only a brief\ntraining period. They are not expected to\ngive up or to be away for very long from\ntheir positions in their research centers\nduring their temporary training and work on\na flight crew. Though the sL-1 payload\nspecialists, being the first, had a longer\ntraining period, the time for the preparation\nof future payload specialists is expected to\nshrink eventually to about 100 hours. This\npreparation period includes the time\nnecessary for their familiarization with the\ninstruments on their assigned missions. This\nabbreviated training is expected to make it\npossible for NASA to recruit distinguished\ninvestigators for work in space who would\nnot be willing to relinquish or substantially\ninterrupt their scientific career positions.\nSpacelab is a machine entirely dependent on\nhuman know-howand human direction.\nNotwithstanding their sophisticated\nautomatic systems, the Shuttle and Spacelab\nare built to carry human crews and to be\noperated by these crews. Beyond its sensitive\nobservation instruments and its other\nadvanced research apparatus, Spacelab\xe2\x80\x98s\nessential ingredients remain the intellect,\njudgment, and skills of the people who\noperate it. There is no substitute o r near\nsubstitute for these qualities. Spacelab relies\ncompletely upon human performance for its\nultimate success. The most important system\naboard Spacelab is its crew.\n35\n\nFrom the U.S. National Aeronautics\nand Space Act which created NAS\n\nc w 1 m4\n\nspacelab\nut Wwk\n\nVisible epiclence ofthe\ntretmmh\narrivinB\nat and stmed in the regk\n\neq\ntm\n\nm m n d i n g the Earth are\nqoradu OccUwentRF of\n\nauroras, theghostly\nnorthern and southern\nlights that dramatically\n\nilluminate the nhht s&.\nSpacelab instrumentsare\nseeking to learn mme about\nthese energy relmses and\ntheir still LittIe-uncZevstood\n&t MZ conditiom MZ the\nEarth.\n\nT\n\nhe treasures that astronauts bring to\nEarth from space are not of a material\nkind. They are far more precious because\nthey are in the form of knowledge\nunobtainable elsewhere.\nThis statement, ofien heard in the early\ndays of the space age, applies more\nappropriately to Spacelab than to any of its\npredecessors.\nThe quest for knowledge is SpaceWs only\ntask All of SpaceWs work is research. To\nextend the boundaries of science and\ntechnology is SpaceZab\xe2\x80\x99s sole assignment.\nThis is essentially true even for S p m W s\nearly missions-sL-1 and ~~-2-oficially\nbilled as \xe2\x80\x9cverification flights.\xe2\x80\x9d Their prime\nobjective is to check out SpaceWs systems in\norbit, test their compatibility with those of\nthe Orbiter in space, and to confirm\nSpaceWs suitability as host to the\ncomplicated experiments awaiting it. But\nthese early flights are more than mere\nshakedown cruises or trial runs.\nTo give SpaceZub the desired realistic tests,\nmany complex experiments, from nearly\nevery major scientific field, are aboard the\nvery first flight.\n\nModule-Pallet Configuration Plies First\nSL-1 carries 38 separate scientific\ninstruments* or \xe2\x80\x9cexperiments packages,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhich the crew uses to perform more than\n70 different experiments for more than 70\ninvestigators who head research groups in 1\n1\nEuropean countries,t the United States, and\nJapan. sL-1 will fly Spacelab in a basic\nconfiguration-the long module plus one\npallet. Twenty-seven instruments are carried\naboard the pallet, eight are installed inside\nthe module, and three use both, with some\ncomponents on the pallet and some inside\nthe module.\nNearly all of these experiments have been\nin preparation for many years. For many of\nthe investigators an important aspect of their\ncareers is riding into orbit with SpazeLab.\n* U S A and ESA agreed to d i A Spacelab3 weight capacity\nequally among thetmzlves@ their ~nstruments.\nEM3\ninstruments are sinder and l&btm Thus ESA has 24\ninstrumentsand NASA 13 aboard =-I.

Some examine the immediate\nsurroundings at Spacelab\xe2\x80\x98s orbital altitude.\nAnd still other experiments take place inside\nthe Spacelab module without any reference to\noutside conditions.\nThis contrasts with the experiment lists for\nsome later Spacelab missions when an entire\nflight may be devoted to research in a single\nscientific discipline. Such \xe2\x80\x9cdiscipline\nmissions\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 make it possible to focus all of a\nflight\xe2\x80\x99s resources and research strategies on\nspecific research objectives.\nIn a discipline mission dedicated to Earth\nresources observations, the Orbiter can\nmaintain its upside-down position (as seen\nfrom Earth) throughout the flight so that\nSpacelab observation instruments can look\ntoward Earth continuously. In a mission\ndedicated to experiments requiring long\nperiods of weightlessness or near\nweightlessness, the Orbiter can restrict its\nmovements and remain floating undisturbed\nat a constant velocity through most of the\nflight. In an astronomy mission the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s\ncargo bay can be kept facing outward toward\nthe celestial objects which are the targets of\nSpacelab\xe2\x80\x98s research instruments.\nIn sL-1 the Orbiter intentionally engages\nin many maneuvers and position changes to\nsatisfjr the needs of the various experiments.\nThe sL-1 list of experiments reads like a mailorder catalogue. The variety is deliberate.\nSome sL-1 experiments are designed to test\nSpacelab\xe2\x80\x99s abilities as a stable observation\nplatform for studying distant research\nsubjects as well as closer ones.\nOther sL-1 experiments will check Spacelab\nfor its performance as a \xe2\x80\x9ctest bed\xe2\x80\x9d for\n38\n\ncalibrating and appraising the usefulness of\nnew instruments and processes. Still other\nexperiments examine Spacelab\xe2\x80\x99s utility as a\nlaboratory for work in materials processing\nand life sciences investigations inside the\nmodule.\nSpace Provides Unique Opportunities\nExperiments planned for Spacelab take\nadvantage of one or more of the five unique\nproperties of space-attributes which cannot\nbe duplicated on Earth:\nProlonged weightlessness (or longenduring below-normal gravity);\nSweeping, wide-angle, \xe2\x80\x9cpicture window\xe2\x80\x9d\nviews of very large regions of the Earth\xe2\x80\x98s\nsurface;\nA view of the universe free from the\nobstructing atmosphere;\nA high, nearly complete vacuum;\nAccess to \xe2\x80\x9cplasmas\xe2\x80\x9d and other phenomena\nin space near the Earth.\nMission planners have divided sL-1\nexperiments into five major categories\n(figures in parentheses show the number of\nexperiments in each category):\nMaterials Processing (also called Materials\nScience) (36)*;\n*One o these is a \xe2\x80\x9ctechnology mperimt.\xe2\x80\x9d\nf\n\nI=\n\ni\n\nExperimt racks\nmunujktured in Italy sit\nready to be installed in the\nSpacelab mdule at the\nassembly plant in Bremen,\nWest Germuny, be@n\nshipment to the United\nStates.

Conversely, some\nexperiments may use data from more than\none instrument.)\n\nMaterials Science\n\n\'\nL\nSpace Plasma Physics.\n\nAtmospheric Physics and\nEarth Observations.\n\nThirty-jiveSL-1 expm\'mnts-nearly half o\nf\nthe total on board-are in thefild o materials\nf\ns c k e .

Also, a\ntechmlogy expm\'ment ly the United States i in\ns\nthe samegmp.\nThe need for improved materials is\nuniversal. Engineers faced with a continuing\ntrend toward miniaturization need alloys\nwith changed conductivity and insulation\ncharacteristics for reliable, less costly\ncommunications and electronic equipment.\nBiomedical researchers seek lighter, stronger\nmaterials for sophisticated surgical\ninstruments and new kinds of prostheses.\nAutomation of industrial machinery and\nhousehold appliances calls for new kinds of\nalloys, plastics, ceramics, composites, and\nglasses with presently unavailable properties.\nArchitects want structural materials that\nhandle easily at reduced cost. They would be\nused for residential, commercial, industrial,\nand public works construction.\nWhether any of these needs can be fidfilled\nwith space technologies remains to be seen.\nSpacela&s materials science experiments are\ndescendants of very promising, but relatively\nprimitive preliminary investigations begun\non Apollo flights in the early 1970s. More\nambitious experiments with a materialsprocessing chamber about the size of a large\nsewing machine were conducted aboard\nSkylab in 1973 and 1974. The new Spacelab\nexplorations are more extensive and use\nmore advanced and more sophisticated\nequipment. They may provide more definite\nanswers.\nAll of these experiments share one\npremise: that in prolonged weightlessness or\nlower-than-normal gravity, materials can be\nmanufactured with properties unobtainable\n\n39\n\non Earth, where weightlessness can be\nachieved for no longer than seconds at a\ntime.\nWhen a heavy and a light metal are heated,\nmelted, and mixed on Earth, the heavier\ncomponents settle before the mixture can be\ncooled to a solid state. In weightlessness in\nspace the mixture remains uniform. Formerly\nincompatible substances can be combined\ninto consistent new kinds of materials.\nUnevenly heated fluids remain still until they\nharden, free from the disturbing convection\ncurrents that normally drive the hotter, and\ntherefore lighter, portions to the top while\nthe cooler portions sink.\nMaterials Studied Early\nOne of the earliest American in-space\nexperiments in materials science took place\non Sunday evening, February 7, 1971, on the\nhome-bound leg of the nine-day Apollo 1\n4\nflight, history\xe2\x80\x98s third successhl manned\nMoon-landing mission.\nDuring a live color telecast from space,\nwhile the crafi was nearing the Earth, the\ncrew heated 18 sealed capsules containing a\ncombination of ingredients, shook them\nbriskly, then cooled them. One of the\ncapsules contained parafin, tungsten pellets,\nand sodium acetate. On Earth, gravity would\nhave quickly separated the heated contents so\nthat the heavier tungsten would have been on\nthe bottom, the sodium acetate in the\nmiddle, and the lighter parafin on top. In\nthe nearly weightless environment of Apollo\n14 the three ingredients retained their\ndistribution to form a mixture never before\nachieved by civilization.\nResults Prove Encouraging\nSimilarly encouraging results emerged\nfrom the other capsules. Among the Apollo\n14 materials experiments were three to test\nmaterials-separation techniques in\nweightlessness. One of these processes, called\nelectrophoresis, is based on the fact that\nmost organic molecules become electrically\ncharged when they are placed in a solution.\nWhen an electric field is applied (through an\nelectrode in contact with the fluid), the\ncharged particles move toward the electrode.\nBecause molecules of different sizes and\nshapes move at different speeds, the faster\nmolecules in a mixture \xe2\x80\x9coutrun\xe2\x80\x9d the slower\nones as they move from one end of the\nsolution to the other. Particles that are alike\ntend to form into layers.\n\n40\n\nc\n\n1\n\nI\n\n-\n\nFIXWARD\nsp*CEuII 1 Yowl\xe2\x82\xac ST&RDOARD SIDE\n\nClose-up (top) shows h b h\nrack used@ materhkscience eapiments.\n\n&pzm shows how this\nrack a t f i r hflfits wall\ninto\nofmodule between other\nf2qeriiment r c .Small\nak\nfimaces and pmess\nchamkc in thk rack\nliquefi, mix, and vesolidifj\nmetals and other muterials\nin nmihtlemss aboard\nSpacelah.\n\nUnwanted substances can be removed by\ntaking out the layer in which they have\naccumulated. The process has been\nparticularly useful in filtering biological\nproducts to prepare purer medical\npreparations and vaccines with h e r adverse\nside reactions. On Earth such separation is\ndifficult or inefficient because the pull of\nEarth\'s gravity overpowers the electrode\nattraction. Technical problems made results\nfrom two Apollo 14 samples inconclusive.\nThe third, a mixture of red and blue dyes,\nindicated the feasibility of obtaining sharper\nseparations in space than is possible on\nEarth. Repetition of the experiments with\nimproved demonstration apparatus during\nthe Apollo 16 Moon-landingflight in April\n1972 tended to confirm these findings.\nBiological &para&.\n\nCmeptfbr Materials\nscience cmfi@4mtion\n(Long Mod&).\n\nSkylab Had Materials Facility\nMaterials processing in space made new\nstrides aboard Skylab in 1973 and 1974 with a\nMaterials Processing Facility that included a\nvacuum chamber 40 centimeters (16 inches)\nin diameter, inside which there was an\nelectric furnace 29 centimeters (11.5 inches)\nlong and 10 centimeters (4 inches) in\ndiameter. With its ability to generate\ntemperatures of up to 1,000 degrees C\n(1,832 degrees F) and to cool at controllable\nrates, the facility was used by astronauts to\nmelt, weld, braze, and cast metals and alloys.\nThis facility produced composite materials\nand formed them into spheres. The facility\nwas also used for growing crystals in\nweightlessness. Several materials science\nexperiments have alre2dy been conducted on\nShuttle flights.\nSpmeWs long module houses the Materials\nScience Double Rack Facility on the first\nflight. It stretches from the module\'s floor to\nthe ceiling and accommodates four hrnaces\nand processing chambers. M e r loading\nprepackaged cartridges containing sample\nmaterials into the processing chambers, crew\n\n4\n1\n\nmembers operate the controls to apply heat\nfor as many as 30 separate experiments.\nOne of the furnaces, the Isothermal\nHeating Facility, retains its temperature at a\nconstant level through each experiment. Two\ncartridges can be processed simultaneously,\none heating while the other cools. This\nfurnace will be used for studies of the\nsolidification of metals and alloys and for\nforming composites. Improved glasses and\nceramics are additional possibilities for this\nunit.\nThe Gradient Heating Facility is designed\nfor studies of crystal growth, and the Fluid\nPhysics Module for studies of behavior of\nfluids in weightlessness. In the absence of\ngravity, liquids do not necessarily sink to the\nbottom of a tank or flow through its floor\noutlets. Nor are heated fluids disturbed by\nconvection currents in their weightless state.\nTwo mirrors in the Mirror Heating Facility\nin the double rack concentrate heat from a\nfilament on a single point or limited\nregion-in contrast to the other furnaces\nwhich heat an entire processing chamber.\nBesides sL-1 experiments accommodated\nby the four furnaces, ,six other experiments in\nthis group require their own special\ninstruments.\nLubricants Study Planned\nOne of these is a technology experiment,\ncalled Tribology in Zero Gravity, which is the\nonly United States investigation in this group\naboard sL-1. Jointly sponsored by Columbia\nUniversity and NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nMarshall Space Flight\nCenter, this experiment seeks to find out\nhow lubricants spread in the absence of\ngravity and how their changed behavior in\nweightlessness may affect friction and\nwearing of moving machine parts. Tribology\nis the study of the effect of moving surfaces\non each other. A payload or mission\nspecialist applies lubricants and then\nphotographs their movement and\ndistribution on stationary as well as on\nmoving surfaces. Experiment findings could\ninfluence future machine designs,\nparticularly equipment for use in space.\nTwo other sL-1 experiments deal with\nadhesion and diffusion of metals, and three\nothers with crystal growth in weightlessness.\nThe possibility of in-spacegrowth of flawless\ncrystals intrigues many scientists and\nengineers. Crystal formation, like metallurgy\nand other materials processing, is subject to\nthree major forces-heat, pressure, and\ngravity. The first two are easily produced and\ncontrolled as desired. Adverse effects of\n42\n\ngravity are beyond control on Earth except\nunder certain special circumstances, such as\nin free fall or in certain flight paths in an\nairplane. O n Earth, elimination of\ngravitational influence is possible for only\nseconds at a time.\nGravity-induced convection in chemical\nsolutions almost invariably causes defects and\nmalformations during crystal growth. Massproduced crystals free of imperfections,\napparently feasible in space, could lead to\nlower-cost and higher-performance\ncommunications and electronics instruments\nand set off another technological revolution\nin these already high-technology industries.\nSimilarly, the prospect of new kinds of\nglasses formed in weightlessness that would\nlend themselves to near-perfect, distortionfree lenses has led experts to envision a new\nage of optical products for industry and\nconsumers.\nContainerless Processing Foreseen\nOptimistic forecasters foresee the\npossibility of containerless processing. Some\nexperiments in that technology have already\nbeen conducted on board Shuttle flights and\nare planned for later Spacdab flights. Metals\nand other molten materials would cool and\nresolidify while floating weightlessly in a\nvacuum without touching any floor, wall, or\nother part of conventional containers.\nSuch a technique is foreseen as the\nultimate in contamination-free processing,\nFamiliarizing himself with\nthe experiments in the\nlaboratoly racks in the\nSpacelab module is Payload\nSpecialist Dr. B.wn K.\nLichtenbqy, whose\nresponsibility on the j n t\nSpacelabJlight will be\nconducting many o these\nf\nexperiments.\n\nbecause contact with any container, however\nslight, causes unwanted temperature changes\nand materials transfer.\nAs now envisioned for hture Spacelab\nmaterials-science research, teardrop-size\nsamples of metals and other materials will be\nheld suspended without visible support and\nkept from drifting by sound waves trained on\nthem from above, below, and the sides. If a\nsample tended to drift in any direction, the\n\xe2\x80\x9caccoustical levitator\xe2\x80\x9d in that area would\nautomatically increase its output of sound\nwaves to push the sample back into place,\nAlso, varying the intensity of the sound is\nexpected to make it possible to shape the\nliquid to desired forms. Sound waves on the\nEarth lack sufficient strength for such action\nagainst the force of the gravity pull, but they\nexert sufficient pressures to hold weightless\nspecimens in their position in a vacuum.\nWhile suspended, the samples would be\nheated, mixed, or otherwise processed,\ncooled for resolidification, and returned to\nEarth for analysis.\n\ncharacter as an exclusive research facility and\nbecome an interim manufacturing facility for\nsmall quantities of these valuable materials.\nThus Space&& could become a forerunner of\nour first factories in orbit, delivering the first\ncommercial products stamped \xe2\x80\x9cMade in\nSpace.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOf all Spacelab experiments, those in the\nmaterials science category are perhaps the\nmost easily understood by nonscientists and\nare most likely to benefit large numbers of\npeople in the near hture. The space plasma\nphysics experiments, which are discussed\nnext, are among the most intricate Spaceld\nwork from the point of view of nonscientists.\n\nSpate Plasma Physics\n\nSix e p \xe2\x80\x98 msaboard SL- -two@\nx mm t\n1\nWest\nGemway, and one eachfirwnAustria, Frame,\nJapan, and the United States-dl invemaate\nthe pmesses that occur around the Earth\nimmdiutely above the atmosphere in the regions\nthrough which Spacelab k travelin&.

With the help of the\nmission specialists they conduct research on\nthemselves and on each other.\nThroughout the flight, from launch\nthrough landing, each payload specialist\nwears a standard battery-powered medical\nrecorder on his belt. Wires from the recorder\nrun to small electrodes glued to the head and\nchest. The electrodes monitor heartbeat, eye\nmovements, and the electrical activity of the\nbrain.\nUpon return to Earth, scientists correlate\neach section of the recordings with the\nwearer\xe2\x80\x99s activities in space at the time the\nrecording was made.

The\nexperiment is called Three-Dimensional\nBallistocardiography in Weightlessness.\nFour experiments-two from the United\nStates and one each from Switzerland and\nWest Germany-require taking blood\nsamples from crew members before, during,\nand afier the flight. Comparison of the\nsamples is expected to show whether any\nreduction of disease-fighting antibodies\noccurred during weightlessness.\nExperimenters will be watching for\nreductions in antibody-producing\nlymphocytes and of hormones in the blood,\nas well as a lessening of the quantity of blood\nin crew members. These experiments also\nrequire in-flight measurements of blood\npressure in arm veins to determine shifis of\nfluids to the upper body. All of these changes\nhave been observed in crews on earlier space\nflights. Why and how these changes take\nplace in weightlessness is only vaguely\nunderstood.\nWeight-GuessingGame Planned\nIn another experiment the payload\nspecialists and mission specialists play a 20minute game. From a box containing 24\nsmall steel balls they remove 2 balls at a time\nand judge which ball in each pair would be\nthe heavier on Earth. All of the balls are of\nthe same size, but on Earth each has a\ndifferent weight. The difference is not easy to\ndiscern in weightlessness.

The test, called Mass\nDiscrimination During Weightlessness, was\ndesigned by researchers at the University of\nStirling, United Kingdom. Performance in\nweightlessness will be compared with results\nfrom the same test upon return to Earth to\ndetect how rapidly crew members readapt to\nnormal gravity.\nThe visual stimulation and recording\nhelmet mentioned at the beginning of this\nchapter is one of three pieces of research\nequipment used by the crew for several\nexperiments that are among the most\nimportant on board sL-1. All three items are\nmeant to help scientists learn more about the\nhuman body\xe2\x80\x99s gravity-sensitiveorgans in the\ninner ear. Disturbances of these organs-the\notolith and vestibular organs-are believed\nto be responsible for the space motion\nsickness which has plagued about half of the\n---de who have gone into space.\nL1\n\ni\n\n56\n\n*\n\nP 56\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n64\n\nWl Study Motion Sickness\ni\nl\nPinpointing the cause and finding\nmethods for preventing or lessening space\nmotion sickness are major objectives of sL-13\nscience program.\nKnown by NASA medical people as \xe2\x80\x9cspace\nadaptation syndrome\xe2\x80\x9d-and on Earth\nvariously as sea, air, or car sickness-the\nillness causes rapid breathing, profuse\nsalivation, cold sweat, and feelings of\napprehension, general discomfort, and\nnausea.\nThe unique helmet is engineered to project\nvarious images to the wearer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, giving\nhim his only visual clues about his body\xe2\x80\x99s\nposition. The experiment is conducted while\nthe wearer floats in weightlessness inside the\nSpacelab module. Restraint devices prevent\nhim from touching walls, floor, ceiling, or\nother objects that might help him orient\nhimself. His only indications of his position\ncome from helmet-generated images and\nfrom orientation organs in his inner ear. If\nclues from these two sources disagree,\ndisorientation and motion sickness may\nresult.\nDesigned by researchers at the Johannes\nGutenberg University in West Germany, the\nhelmet is used for an experiment conducted\nby a team at the Germ& university as well as\na team at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology and in Canada. Dr. Byron K.\nLichtenberg, an sL-1 payload specialist, is a\nmember of the MIT team which prepared this\nexperiment for analyzing the brain\xe2\x80\x99s\nadaptation to the unusual conditions in\nweightlessness.

The fhgi\xe2\x80\x99s customary\ngrowth changes are governed by a 24-hour\ncycle called \xe2\x80\x9ccircadian rhythms\xe2\x80\x9d believed to\nbe triggered by day-night clues or other\nsubtle environmental changes. Or it may be\ndue to internal mechanisms unaffected by any\nexterior happenings. This experiment was\nprepared by the State University of New York\nat Binghamton.\nLife sciences experiments, second in\nnumber only to materials science\nexperiments on sL-1, will continue to receive\nhigh priority on future Spacelab flights. Two\nscientist-astronauts, Dr. Norman E. Thagard\nand Dr. William E. Thornton, both\nphysicians, have been assigned as mission\nspecialists to Spacela6\xe2\x80\x98s third flight, expressly\nfor continuing research on the space\nadaptation syndrome. NASA wants to learn\nwhether it will be possible to identifjr persons\nwho are particularly vulnerable to it, whether\nits onset can be predicted, and what\ncountermeasures can be taken against it. The\nSL-3flight-( sTS-l8)-will include\nexperiments in materials processing, space\ntechnology, and life sciences.\nDr. Thagard conducted extensive research\non the problem while assigned as a mission\nspecialist on STS-7 in June 1983, as did Dr.\nThornton as a mission specialist on STS-8in\nAugust 1983.\nStill more extensive research on space\nmotion sickness and a variety of other\nmedical and biological subjects is planned on\nwhich is the\nthe fifth Spacelab flight (SL-4)\nfirst discipline mission entirely dedicated to\nlife sciences research. Twenty-four\nexperiments on that flight will cover a wide\nrange of medical and biological subjects\naimed at safeguarding human health in space,\nusing the orbital environment to advance\nknowledge in medicine and biology and\nusing space technology for solutions of\nmedical and biological problems on Earth.\n50\n\nLife science experiments will also be a\nlarge part of the D-1 German mission\npayload.\n\nAstronomy and Solar Physics\nSix instruments aboard sL-1 are des&ned@r\no the Sun and Stan.

All of them\nexploit the obvious advantage of observation\nfrom orbit: the absence of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nobstructing atmosphere. Researchers expect\nthat in the relatively few days available for\nexperiments during Spacelab\xe2\x80\x99s flight, more\nand better observations can be made than\nwould be possible in several decades from\nthe Earth.\n\n1\ni\n\n?\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\nAmong the most important\nresearch subjects in the l$\ns c k e s aboard Spacelab\narethecmmembws\nthemselves.

Only a small\nsegment of radiations in the electromagnetic\nspectrum reaches low altitudes or the Earth\'s\nsurface. Most radiations are filtered or\nabsorbed by the upper atmosphere.\nEven for detection of those radiations\nwhich can reach the ground-including\n\nvisible light-the atmosphere poses a\npersistent handicap to scientific sky watchers.\nEver-present water vapor and dust distort or\nblock incoming radiations. Debris from\nvolcanic eruptions often remains in the upper\natmosphere for several years. Added to these\nnatural hindrances are such synthetic\nimpediments as smoke, smog, and electronic\ninterference. Light from cities often\noverwhelms faint star light.

Not surprisingly,\nastronomical instruments were among the\nfirst scientific sensors to be attached to the\nearliest space rockets. Instruments on early\nsounding rockets made important\nastronomical discoveries. They detected stars\nemitting X-rayswhich are not detectable\nfrom the ground. These achievements are\nespecially remarkable since these instruments\nremained above the atmosphere for only a\nfew minutes before falling back to Earth.\nSince then many satellites have been outfitted\nwith astronomical instruments, and\nastronauts on manned space flights have\nmade valuable observations.\nBeyond satisfying curiosity about the\nnature of our universe, astronomy research\ncould produce many practical results. For\nexample, the processes by which quasars and\npulsars produce vast quantities of energy\nremain unexplained. Understanding them\ncould lead to new energy-generating\ntechniques that could provide inexhaustible\nand inexpensive energy supplies on Earth.\nAstronomical observations in the 16th and\n17th centuries helped originate theories\nleading to some of the mechanisms that\nmade possible the Industrial Revolution of\nthe 18th and 19th centuries that still\ninfluence our lives today.\nAstronomy Studies Planned\nHaving astronomers at work in space and\noperating an observatory there is one of the\nmain purposes for building SpaceLab. The\nthird Spacelab flight-s~-2-has a large part\nof the mission devoted to astronomy. Its 13\nmajor experiments are entirely devoted to\nastronomy and Sun research, including\ninfrared astronomy, solar physics, and plasma\nphysics.\nScientists call SL-2a \xe2\x80\x9csuper mission,\xe2\x80\x9d\nbecause its experiments call for the largest\nand heaviest astronomy instruments ever\ntaken into space. Transporting equipment of\nsuch size and weight into orbit was\nimpracticable or impossible until Space\nShuttle.\nA special structure will be installed in the\nshuttle cargo bay to support a dome-topped\ntwo-ton cosmic ray detector.

It requires\nno habitable module because all of the\nexperiments aboard can readily be controlled\nby payload and mission specialists from the\nOrbiter\'s flight deck or remotely from the\nground. To house various items of equipment\nwhich would otherwise be inside a module\nbecause they require a normal atmosphere or\nmoderate temperatures, an igloo will be\ninstalled ahead of the front pallet.\nSL-2was originally expected to be the\nsecond Spacelab flight, as its designation\nclearly indicates. Delays in the completion of\nthe one-ton IPS, a very complex precision\ninstrument designed as an aid for orbital\nastronomy observations, caused SL-2 be\nto\npostponed to March 1985,so that it will take\nplace later than SL-3,\nnow scheduled for\nSeptember 1 8 .Despite this transposition,\n94\nflight officials have decided to retain the SL-2\nand SL-3\nmission numbers as they were\noriginally assigned.\nSL-3,also a dedicated mission-meaning\nthe Orbiter\'s facilities are exclusively devoted\nto Spadab-is the first operational Spacelab\nflight in which the primary objective is the\nacquisition of scientific data rather than the\ntesting and verification of Spacelab systems.\nMany of SL-3\'s\nmajor experiments take\nadvantage of the absence of normal gravity.\nTo maintain weightlessness or very low\ngravity, the crew will refrain as much as\npossible from firing the craft\'s thrusters for\nsteering or positioning the craft. Changes in\nspacecrafi position or orbital paths cause at\nleast slight disruption of the weightless state.\nKey research on the mission will include\nmaterials-processing and life-sciences\nexperiments.\n\n53\n\nStudy ofStars Planned\nOn the3n-t Spacelabflight-SL-l-t~e\nUnited States and France each has a star and a\nSun observation inmment.

Very little\nlarge-scaleultraviolet mapping of the sky has\nbeen accomplished to date. A payload\nspecialist and a mission specialist install the\ninstrument, a combination telescope camera,\ninto the experiment module\xe2\x80\x99s scientific\nairlock during the flight.

Ultraviolet radiation is\ncharacteristically emitted by very young stars\nshortly after they form, and by very old stars\nnear the ends of their life cycles.\nUltt-avblet Telescope-A companion\nexperiment is to be conducted by the United\nStates with an instrument whose major\ncomponents were built in France. It uses\nwide-field sensors, more sensitive than ever\nused before in space, for extensive surveys of\nvery faint sources of ultraviolet radiations.\nThe instrument, called a Far Ultraviolet\nSpace Telescope, has previously been used\nonly for brief rocket observations.\nThe sensors are sufficiently sensitive to\ndetect the very faint ultraviolet emissions\nbelieved to emanate from stars reaching the\nends of their lives. The crew will operate this\npallet-mounted experiment from controls\ninside the module.

The Sun\xe2\x80\x99s radiations are the major\ninfluence on our weather.\nSun Moniw-An automated palletmounted instrument requiring no attention\nfrom the crew contains three heat detectors\n(pyroheliometers). They measure the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s\nradiations, ranging from those in the\nextreme ultraviolet through those in the far\ninfrared. The instrument, called an Active\nCavity Radiometer, is being carried aboard\nSpacelab for scientists at the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory in Pasadena, California, who will\nanalyze the measurements.\n\nE w g y Detector-This pallet-mounted\ninstrument, called a Solar Spectrum\nMonochromator, measures three separate\nkinds of radiations to determine the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s\nenergy emissions. Three measuring and\ncounting devices called double\nmonochromators are used-one each for\nultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiationsto detect variations in Sun radiations in each\nradiation range. Changes in each of these\nranges have different effects on the\natmosphere. Analysis of this experiment\xe2\x80\x99s\ndata will be made by the Avionics Service of\nthe National Center for Scientific Research\nin France. The observations with this\ninstrument and with the radiometer\n(described above) are the first simultaneously\nmeasuring the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s total radiations in\ndifferent spectral ranges from space.\nRadiation Sensor-Controlled by the\nSpacelab computer and payload crew, this\nradiation sensor (pyroheliometer) attempts\nto measure the solar constant, the total\nradiation received on the Earth from the\nSun, with great accuracy. This measurement\nalso helps determine how much solar\nradiation is reflected back into space or\nabsorbed by the Earth and helps determine\nEarth\xe2\x80\x98s energy gain, or \xe2\x80\x9cradiation budget.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Royal Meteorological Institute in\nBelgium will analyze the results of this\nexperiment and compare this data with the\nmeasurements of the other two Sun\nobservation experiments aboard scl-the\nradiometer and the monochromators\ndescribed above. All of these three\ninstruments are expected to be reflown\nrepeatedly in space for measurements over\nlong periods of variations in Sun output.\n55\n\nAtmospheric Physics and Earth\nObseryatwns\nSix instruments aboard SL-1are desgned to\nstudy the Earth-@r o them the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nf\natmosphere and t w o the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s suface.\nThe two suface observation instruments are\nJ. m Germany. Three o the ahnospheric\nio West\nf\nstudy instruments areFrance and one is\nfirnn the United States.\nFour o these instruments are mounted on the\nf\npalleq one is inside the module, and one has\ncmponents on the pallet and in the module.\nEven before the earliest satellites\nconfirmed it, scientists were convinced that a\nvantage point in orbit would make an ideal\nobservation position for studies of Earth. Its\nlands, oceans, and atmosphere could be\nviewed from a new perspective and in ways\nnever before possible.\nEarlier experience with instruments on\nballoons, aircraft, and rockets showed they\nprovide only limited information. Their point\nof view is localized. Sounding rockets which\nreach altitudes above the atmosphere can\nlook over large areas but their viewing time\nis very short. Automated Earth observation\nsatellites do provide a sweeping view of vast\nregions, but the resolution of their\nobservations is usually relatively low because\nthey most often orbit at high altitudes.\nSpacelab, at its relatively low orbital\naltitude, is expected to combine the sweeping\nview with high-resolution observations and\ngive scientists the added advantage of crews\n\naboard who can focus and adjust the\nequipment as they monitor it for best\npossible results.\n\nSix Experiments Study Earth\nMetric Camera-Only a little more than\none-third of the Earth\xe2\x80\x98s land areas have been\nmapped adequately for the global resources\nplanning required to accommodate the\nplanet\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly increasing population.\nConventional techniques are too slow to\nprovide the needed up-to-date maps. sL-1\ncarries a metric camera similar to those used\nin surveys from airplanes. In-orbit tests will\ndetermine whether the camera can be used\nfrom space to map the remaining two-thirds\nof Earth\xe2\x80\x98s lands within a short time. The\ncamera, which is being included for\nexperimenters in West Germany, uses 24centimeter (10-inch) film to provide\nphotographs with much better resolution\nthan is obtained from most unmanned,\nautomated Earth-observation satellites. The\ncrew mounts the camera in the core module\xe2\x80\x99s\nviewport.

The facility\'s\nantenna is mounted on the pallet, but the\ninstrument\'s other components are in the\nmodule. The instrument is operated\nautomatically.

The\ncamera is part of a French experiment called\nWaves in the OH Emissive Layer for studies\nof the atmosphere from orbit. Another\nFrench instrument called the Grille\nSpectrometer is designed to study the\npresence of carbon dioxide, water vapor,\nozone, and other gases in the atmosphere at\naltitudes between 15 and 150 kilometers (9\nto 93 miles). Still another French experiment\nmeasures radiation resulting from action of\nsunlight on hydrogen in the Earth\'s\natmosphere, in the solar system, and in our\ngalaxy. A U.S. experiment in the sL-1\natmospheric series, contributed by scientists\nat the Utah State University, measures\nairglow in the atmosphere in visible and\ninvisible light.

The\nthree-the pilot, a mission specialist, and a\npayload specialist-make up the \xe2\x80\x9cBlue Shift.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey start at once to prepare themselves to\nexchange places with the three other crew\nmembers-the commander, the other\nmission specialist and the other payload\nspecialist-who are designated the \xe2\x80\x9cRed\nShift.\xe2\x80\x9d* The Red Shift is nearing the end of a\n12-hourduty period at their work stations on\nthe Orbiter\xe2\x80\x98s flight deck and in the Space&&\nmodule.\nThis is the beginning of another day for\nthe Blue Shift and the approach of the end of\nthe day for the Red Shift.\nRecorded music from mission control has\nbeen the traditional wake-up call used by\nNASA for space crews for more than 20 years,\never since Astronaut L. Gordon Cooper, Jr.,\nbecame the first American to sleep in space\nin mid-May 1963. Cooper\xe2\x80\x98s 34-hour, 22-orbit\nmission was the first U.S. manned overnight\nflight in space and the last in the six-flight\nseries with the one-man Mercury spacecraft.\nAlone in that small craft, Cooper could not\nstand or stretch, but had to sit cramped on\nthat craft\xe2\x80\x99s small seat throughout the flight\nwhether awake or asleep.\nIn comparison to Mercury, living quarters\nfor Shuttle-Spmhbcrews are almost\nluxurious.\nShuttle-S\xe2\x80\x99mt?Zab crew members can recline\non three comfortable bunks built into the\nstarboard wall of the living quarters in the\nOrbiter\xe2\x80\x99s mid deck on the lower level of the\ntwo-tiered crew compartment.

The upper level, called the flight\ndeck, holds instrument and control panels\nfor the commander and pilot and also\nincludes work stations with controls and\ndisplays for the mission and payload\nspecialists. The display and controls resemble\na large airplane\'s cockpit.\nEquipment for each bunk includes pillows\nand individual light, fan, comrhnications\nstation, sound-suppressingblanket, and\nsheets with restraints to keep the sleeper\nfrom drifiing offweightlessly through the\ncabin.\nSleeping i Weightlessness\nn\nOn the first several Shuttle flights crew\nmembers still used cocoonlike sleeping bags\nattached to the provision lockers and\nsomewhat resembling the sleep stations of\nSkylab. The Orbiter retains one such station\nnear the bunks. Crew members enter a small\nclosetlike enclosure, hook themselves up, and\ngo to sleep in an apparently vertical\nposition. Since there is no up or down in\nweightlessness, the sleeping orientation is of\nno concern.\nFeeling rested and alert, the three Blue\nShift crew members unclasp the restraints\nand are about to plunge into their morning\nroutine when a voice from mission control\non their speaker comes up with another U.S.\nspace tradition-an early-morning news\nsummary from Planet Earth: A professional\nbaseball team dropped an important game,\nto the disgust of the fans in the crew. One of\nthe crew members\' children won a prize in a\ncollegiate contest. The voice at mission\ncontrol thought the father would like to\nknow. The European crew member hears the\nresults of an international soccer match. The\nPresident held a news conference in which he\nsaid the nation is eagerly watching Spacelab\'s\nprogress. It has been raining in Houston\nalmost continuously ever since the flight\nbegan. But long-range forecasts indicate ideal\nconditions at the Kennedy Space Center in\nFlorida a week hence, when the Orbiter\nreturns there for its landing on the oversize\nthree-mile runway. Otherwise, the voice says,\nour Earth is still spinning as it always has.\nLavatory in Orbit\nThe Orbiter has only one washroom and\ntoilet. Crew members take turns-like a\ntraveling family sharing a motel room.\nSanitation facilities are much the same as on\nthe Earth. Airflow substitutes for gravity in\ncarrying away the wastes.\n60\n\nPlastic sleeves around the hand wash basin\nkeep stray droplets from floating away into\nthe cabin. Streams of air rush water over the\nhands and then out into the wastewater\ncollection tanks. Floating water droplets in\nthe cabin would become a nuisance, as well\nas a hazard to equipment and crew.\nToilet waste is pushed by air streams into a\ncontainer. Some waste may be intentionally\nsaved. Its analysis tells doctors which\nminerals crew members may lose excessively\nin weightlessness. Such periodic checks\nincrease the understanding of bodily\nfunctions and indicate what food\nsupplements may be needed for space\ntravelers on lengthy flights in the future.\nCrew members may use conventional\nshaving cream and safety razors and\ndisposable towels. For those preferring\nelectric shavers, there is a windup shaver\noperating like an electric model but\nrequiring no plug or battery. It has a built-in\nvacuum device that sucks up whiskers as the\nshaving proceeds. Free-floating whiskers\ncould foul up equipment and become a\nserious nuisance. For a sponge-bath, the only\nkind available, there is a watergun adjustable\nfor temperatures from 18 to 35 degrees C\n(65 to 95 degrees F).\nc,\n\nk\n\nkil\n\nI\n\nBeparing a Space Shuttle\nmeal i d the enginem\'ng\nmodel at the Johnson Space\nCentw in Texas am\nScienristhtmnaut Dr.\nRhea Seddon (right) and\nAstmnaut Donald E.\nWilliams.

The food as well as\nthe food preparation facilities could easily be\nthe envy of many earthbound chefs,\nhomemakers, and diners. Crew members can\nselect from a menu almost as varied and\ncertainly as tasty and nutritious as in most\nhomes or restaurants. One crew member can\nprepare meals for his shift in about five\nminutes. Members of the Blue and Red Shifts\nmay eat breakfast and dinner together on\nsome missions if schedules permit.\nIn a galley to the left of the bunks are an\noven, hot and cold water dispensers, and a\npantry stocked with 74 kinds of food and 20\ndifferent beverages. There are drinking cups\nand eating utensils. Dining trays separate\ndifferent food containers and keep them from\nlifting off and floating through the cabin.\nThere is no refrigerator and none is\nneeded. To save weight and space, most onboard foods are dehydrated by a freezedrying process developed specially for space\nuse.Ample water for reconstituting these\nfoods is provided by the fuel cells, which\ndeliver clean water as a by-product of their\nelectricity-generating chemical processes.\nSome foods are stored in conventional\nsealed, heat-sterilized cans or plastic\npouches. A few foods, such as cookies and\nnuts, are in ready-to-eat form. Meals provide\nfor an average of 2,700 calories daily.\nExperience from earlier space flights shows\ncrews need about as many calories in space as\nthey do on Earth.\nRehydratirm unit@ use in\nmeal preparation i the\nn\ngaLLey aboard the Shutzk\'s\nmid deck.

Garbage,\ntrash, and soiled clothing are sealed in\nairtight plastic bags. This is an important\nhealth measure, because studies have shown\nthat microbes can increase in extraordinary\nquantities in a confined, weightless\nenvironment.\n\nShift Change Described\nThe Blue Shift is ready for the day\'s work.\nThe pilot floats through the open hatch\nleading through the mid deck\'s ceiling. He\nemerges through the floor of the flight deck\non the cabin\'s upper level and takes his seat\nto the right of the commander. Both are on\nidentical seats, facing the instrument panels.\nBoth are on duty during launch, de-orbit,\nand reentry, as well as during other critical\nspace maneuvers. The consoles in front and\nto their sides have duplicate flight controls to\nenable them to operate the Orbiter from\neach seat independently should an emergency\nrequire it. During launch and reentry one or\ntwo mission specialists sit on removable seats\nbehind them. Remaining mission specialists\nand the payload specialists sit below on the\nmid deck.\nThe commander now briefs the pilot on\nthe Orbiter\'s performance during the last 12\nhours. Then the commander signs off with\nmission control, leaving the pilot in charge.\nHe lowers himself through the hatch into the\nmid-deck living quarters to begin his 12-hour\nrecreation and sleep period.\nIn the aft flight deck, directly behind the\npilot but facing to the rear of the cabin, the\nBlue Shift mission specialist has taken his\nplace at the mission operation display and\ncontrols and scrutinizes the video display\nindicating the performance of OrbiterSpacelab systems, including electrical power\nand communications supporting Spacelab.\nTwo windows, both to his right in the back\nwall of the flight deck, look out on Spacelab\nin the cargo bay.\nThe Blue Shift mission specialist confers\non the intercom with his Red Shift\ncounterpart who is presently inside the\nmodule working with the payload specialist\non experiments. Having satisfied himself that\nreadings are normal, the Blue Shift mission\nspecialist moves down through one of the\nflight deck floor hatches to the mid deck,\n\n61\n\nthen into the tunnel to the module. There he\ntakes the place of the Red Shift mission\nspecialist, who returns through the tunnel to\nthe mid-deck living quarters for his\nrecreation and sleep period.\nThe Blue Shift payload specialist takes the\nroute followed by the mission specialist into\nthe module. There, after receiving a short\nbriefing about events in the last 12 hours, he\ntakes the place of the Red Shift payload\nspecialist, who leaves the module for his rest\nperiod in the living quarters.\nHaving begun their work, the Blue Shift\nmission specialist and payload specialist\ninside the module discuss upcoming\nexperiments with experts on the ground. It is\na new experience in manned orbital flight.\nLong, continuous space-to-ground-to-space\ncommunications have not occurred since the\nApollo Moon flights. In those the long\ndistance of the craft from the Earth gave the\ncrews a sweeping view of Earth, so that at\nleast one of the deep-space antennas on three\ncontinents were in communication with the\nspacecraft at all times. But the relatively low\norbital altitudes of all other manned flights\nleave ground-based antennas beyond the\nspacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s horizon during most of each\norbit. Rarely more than about 20 minutes of\ncommunication time was available during\neach 90-minute orbit.\n\nCommunicationsVia Satellite\nThough not yet in hll operation for sL-1, a\nnew communication facility called the\nTracking and Data Relay Satellite System\n(TDRSS) will eventually provide coverage\na large part of the time for Spacelab and all\nother Shuttle flights wherever they are in\nEarth orbit.\nWhen completed, TDRSS (NASA officials\npronounce the acronym \xe2\x80\x9ctea dress\xe2\x80\x9d) is to\nconsist of three stationary (Earthsynchronous) communications satellites. Two\nof these are to be in operation, while the\nthird is to be in orbit as a spare to replace\nany malhnctioning satellite.\nAt the altitude of 35,890 kilometers\n(22,350 miles)-some 150 times higher than\nthe Orbiter-at least one of the two\noperating TDRSS satellites is nearly always in\nthe line of sight with the Orbiter. Both\nsatellites will always be in view of the TDRSS\nground station at White Sands, New Mexico.\nThe two operating satellites act as relay\nstations for the Earth-to-mss-to-OrbiterS\xe2\x80\x99acefd-to-\xe2\x80\x9dDRss-to-Earth\ncommunications.\nVoice, video, and data between the White\nSands station and the control center at the\n62\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nmonitor and participate in\nSpacelab Rxpermmts\nalmost as $they wem\naboard the Orbiter t h g h\ncommunicationslinks which\ngive them the same\ninstantanma instnrmmt\nand computer readouts and\nd q h y s at the Payload\noperations G m center\nm l\n(pocc)( s h m here in\n\nJohnson Space Center are transmitted via\ndomestic communications satellites.\nTDRSS,\nexpected ultimately to replace most\nof the ground stations of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\n20-year-old\nSpaceflight Tracking and Data Network, has\nonly one of its satellites in orbit in time for\nuse during the sL-1mission. That satellite\n(TDRS-A) was launched April 5,1983,\nfrom\nthe cargo bay of the Orbiter Ct3albgm, then\nmaking its maiden flight. It was the sixth\nShuttle flight (STS-6). a malfunction in\nAfter\nan upper stage rocket the satellite entered an\nelliptical orbit far too low to serve its\nintended communications function. By a\nseries of carefully calculated firings of the\nsatellite\xe2\x80\x99s small thruster engines by remote\nradio command, NASA and industry\ncontrollers gradually raised that orbit over a\nperiod of several weeks to a circular orbit at\nsynchronous altitude. The launch of the\nsecond TDRSS satellite (TDRS-B), been\nhas\npostponed to 1984.\nTo compensate partly for the curtailment\nof transmission capabilities before the\navailability O TDRS-B, sL-1carries more\nf\nrecording tapes than had originally been\nplanned for storing research instrument data\non board during communications\ninterruptions, until they can be transmitted\nto Earth or returned with Spacelab.\nTDRSS\xe2\x80\x99S planned capacity for voice, data,\nand video communications between ground\nstations and orbiting satellites is expected to\nintroduce a new dimension to manned-space\nscience activities. This capacity will be\nexploited for the first time with SpaceZab.\nScientists on the ground can watch their own\nexperiments as they are being operated\naboard Spacelab. When the TDRSS is fully\noperational, they will be able to see\nexperiment results on video screens and\ncomputer readouts on the ground at the\nsame time as the payload specialists who are\nconducting the experiment in Spacelab.\nEarthbound scientists can discuss an\nexperiment with the payload specialists as the\nexperiment progresses in Spacelab.\n\nTDRS\n\nV\n(opposite) NASA3 new\nTrackin. and Data Relay\nsatellite ( R ), top night,\nm T\nserves as an orbit-togroundto-orbitcommunications\nlink Jbr Shuttle/Spacelab,\nfar belom at night, as well as\njiir other law-altitude\nsatellites such as the\nLandsat Earth obsewation\nsatellite, center.

They can advise the payload\nspecialist how best to take advantage of\nthem-or how to deal with unexpected\nproblems.\n\nIn contrast, payload specialists aboard\nSpacelab can devote almost their entire\nattention and time to the scientific\nexperiments.\nAs on every manned U.S. space flight, crew\nactivities aboard Spacelab are governed by a\nflight plan. Known as a \xe2\x80\x9ctimeline,\xe2\x80\x9d this\nprogram schedule spells out minute by\nminute in around-the-clocklistings the time\nand order of every event aboard Spacelab\nand what each crew member is\nexpected to be doing at any particular time\nduring the mission. Spacelab timelines show\nexactly when each research instrument is to\nbe turned on and off, when readings need to\nbe taken, and when other observations are to\nbe made.\nExperience shows that, particularly when\na new craft or new instrument is first flown,\nunexpected problems or malhnctions\nsometimes force timeline changes during the\nflight. Similarly, if in the judgment of the\ncrew, the scientists, and mission controllers\nunanticipated favorable conditions hold out\nthe promise of extraordinary research gains,\non-the-spottimeline changes can be made to\ntake advantage of this serendipity.\nSpacelab timelines are the culmination of\nSpacelab Interfaces with Earth\npreparations and planning which began\nbefore the flights, years ago.

About as long as a football field\nand nearly as wide, and 50 feet (15 meters)\nhigh, the OW Building comprises a virtual\nassembly line for space science. It has\nfacilities where arriving experiments are\nunpacked, retested by the experimenters\nthemselves, and readjusted and recalibrated\nbefore they are installed on the pallets or in\nthe racks. Additional testing assures that the\nresearch instruments can share Spmelab\naccommodations without interfering with\neach other or with Spmehb or Orbiter\nsystems.\n65\n\n.\n\nLoaded racks are then connected with each\nother into rack trains in the same sequence in\nwhich they are to appear in the module and\nare lifted inside it.\nModules and pallets are then transferred to\nthe Orbiter Processing Facility and there\ninstalled in the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s cargo bay. The\nOrbiter, with Spacelab aboard, is moved to\nthe Vehicle Assembly Building where the\nOrbiter is mated to the large external he1\n\ntank and two solid rocket boosters. Then the\nentire assembly is moved on the tractor\ncrawler to the launch pad and readied for\nlifioff.\nPayload Specialists Get Training\nMeanwhile, mission and payload specialists\nare undergoing intensive training, much of it\nin simulators-replicas that behave as closely\nas possible to flight units.\nThispicture o a crew\nf\nm b p at work at a data\nystm display terminal\ninside Spacelab will repeat\nitselfoften in mbit. h h at\nthe Spacelab Payload Crew\nTraining C m p h at\nUASA.\xe2\x80\x99S Marshall Space\nFlight Center in Huntsville,\nAlabama, Dr.Claude\nNuollier shows what the\nterminal will look like.

Hi is presently\nin training a~a Mission\nSpecialist at theJohnson\nSpace Center in Houston,\nTexas.\n\n66\n\nIn Johnson Space Center\xe2\x80\x99s Orbiter\nsimulator, payload specialists acquaint\nthemselves with the layout and furnishings of\nthe Orbiter\xe2\x80\x98s living and work areas and\npractice using these facilities. Since SpaceZab\nhas no living facilities other than its\nlaboratory-workshop, crew members have to\ncommute through the tunnel to the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s\nmid deck for food, recreation, sleep, and the\nuse of sanitary facilities.\nAt JSC\xe2\x80\x99S Spacelab simulator the mission and\npayload specialists learn how to use the\nSpacelab systems such as the Control and\nData Management System and the scientific\nairlock. At Marshall Space Flight Center\xe2\x80\x99s\nPayload Crew Training Complex they\nrehearse their timeline schedules. In training\nsessions running continuously for many\nhours they simulate operating the research\ninstruments as scheduled. Computers\nprogrammed to simulate each instrument\xe2\x80\x99s\nresponses to the crew\xe2\x80\x98s inputs make these\ntraining sessions almost indistinguishable\nfrom their experiences later on the flight.\nThe computers are programmed to\nsimulate problems and malfunctions of the\ninstruments as part of payload specialists\xe2\x80\x99\ntraining for handling almost any\ncontingency.\nFor past space flights this type of training\nhas been so realistic that returning crews\nhave said the mission itself seemed to be\nmerely another simulation. Sometimes the\nflights seemed easier than the simulations\nfilled with the computer-contrived problems\nand malhnctions. Fortunately, most of these\ncontrived emergencies never occurred during\nthe flights.\nMuch of the training of payload specialists\ntakes place at the laboratories of the chief\ninvestigators who designed the experiments.\nPayload specialists spend much of their time\ntraveling to these laboratories and meeting\nwith these scientists and their staffs.\nFrequently the mission specialists accompany\n\nthem on these trips. They learn operation of\nthe instruments and their idiosyncracieshow to use them, adjust them, and repair\nthem.\nThe trip in space may be a one-time\nexperience for many payload specialists.\nTheir attention will be deeply absorbed in\nalmost nonstop explorations into the\nunknown. There are unlikely to be any\nordinary days for them aboard SpmeZab, if\nindeed any day that has 15 sunrises and\nsunsets can ever be called ordinary. As they\ncomplete each of their 12-hour duty shifts,\nthey will almost certainly have had a day as\nexciting and satisfjmg as any scientists ever\nhad at their work.\nTwo Shifts an Innovation\nSTS-g/SL- 1,which is America\xe2\x80\x99s 40th\nmanned space flight, is the first with regular\nin-flight shift changes. On all except a few\nearlier U.S. manned space flights, all crew\nmembers worked and slept at the same hours.\nWhile they were asleep, mission control\nwatched the spacecraft systems remotely via\ntelemetry. Built-in alarm systems awakened\nthe crew in emergencies.\nThough there are obvious advantages in\nkeeping experiments operating and under\ndirect observation on a 24-hour-a-daybasis,\nsome observers believe the schedule of two\n12-hour shifts will not become a permanent\nfeature of U.S. space missions. They reason\nthat, in a relatively small spacecraft, off-duty\ncrew members are likely to have their sleep\ndisturbed by noise from the working\nmembers of the crew and operating\ninstruments. Single shifts for the entire crew\nare planned for some Spacdab flights.\nAs the Red Shift crew members begin\ntheir recreation period on the mid deck, one\nof the three may dictate the recollections of\nthe day\xe2\x80\x98s happenings into a tape recorder and\nmake some written notes for a private diary.\nOthers may relax with a variety of games\nstocked for their use during leisure hours.\nMusic for after-dinner listening is available\nfrom the mid deck\xe2\x80\x99s small tape library before\nthey sleep. In a few hours mission control\nwill again jar them awake with the blaring\nnotes of the next wake-up call.\n\n67\n\nI Spacelab we have\ntransjihd the\nLdjough2s and dmam\no f thomad into dity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n7\nJ\n\nI\n\nJamesM.\nBeggs,NASA Administrator\nat the ceremony for S\xe2\x80\x99melatr\xe2\x80\x99s arrival\nfrom Europe at the Kennedy Space\nCenter in Florida, February 5,1982.\n\nJ\n\nc\n7\n\nSpmehb:\nIts Birt,,,\nIts Impa&\nIts Fgmre\nA\n\nA\n\nI\n\nmadc in the opnatimrand\nRsiuht Gewge Bush\nCheckout Building at the\nKktnea\'y Space Center in\n(center) t l s with two cretl,\nak\n+\ntnetnbm-Mkim Specialist F h i d z sburtly a the\nfi.Owen K.

Now, more than 10 years\nlater, when the familiar countdown at the\nKennedy Space Center culminates in lifioff,\nSpacetub is finally on its way to orbit aboard\nthe Shuttle. The thoughts that were but\ndreams a decade ago will be ready for "their\neffects [to] be tried."\nSpm2a.b\'~work is not as dramatic or\nspectacular as the Moon flights were. Yet\ntogether the Shuttle and Spmtub comprise\nthe foundation for the US. manned space\nprograms for the remainder of the 1980s and\nvery likely deep into the 1990s.\nExperience from Shuttle and Spacelab\noperations and research is bound to\ninfluence the design, direction, and extent of\nhture space projects, particularly of manned\nspace activities, for the next decade or two.\nMoreover, the success of SpmMs\nperformance and the research carried out on\nboard will undoubtedly have a significant\nimpact on hture international cooperation in\nspace ventures.\nThe first seeds of the Spmlub concept were\nsown in the late 1960s. Dr. Thomas 0.Paine,\nthen NASA Administrator, traveled to 19\ncountries to assess their interest in\ncooperating with the United States in space.\nThe first U.S. Apollo manned Moon landings\nwere high priority aspects of the American\nspace effort. U.S. space planners were looking\nat possibilities for post-Apollo programs.\nThey were appraising projects to succeed the\nmanned Moon landing missions.\nAll Apollo follow-on programs seriously\nconsidered were necessarily expensive. Most\nof them implied worldwide efforts. Thus they\nwere candidates for international sharing.\n\nTask Group Considers Options\nEvolution of the Spadab concept had its\nbeginnings in a task group appointed during\nthe Nixon Administration. With the work on\nthe Apollo series of spacecraft completed,\npersonnel were directed to investigate how\nNASA might best conduct scientific\ninvestigations in space during the closing\ndecades of the 1900s.\nOptions they considered included (a) a\nreusable Space Shuttle vehicle; (b) a manned\nplanetary expedition to Mars; and (c) design\nand construction of a permanent orbiting\nspace station.\nPresident Nixon decided that only one of\nthese options at a time would be supported.\nSpace Shuttle was the one chosen.\nSupporting studies for the post-Apollo\neffort in space had focused on modular space\n69\n\nsufficiently small size for delivery in the\nShuttle\xe2\x80\x99s cargo bay. In their discussions of a\nspace station, engineers often referred to\n\xe2\x80\x9cresearch and applications modules\xe2\x80\x9d (RAMS).\nThese unmanned units would be designed to\ncarry research instruments into orbit, stay for\na year or two, and then be returned to Earth\nand exchanged for other units with new\nexperiments.\nWhen the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision deferred an\nearly start for a space station, NASA\nimmediately modified the RAM concept to\nmodules that would enter orbit in the\nShuttle, perform their hnctions as a shortstay \xe2\x80\x9csortie laboratory,\xe2\x80\x9d and return to Earth\nat the end of the Shuttle mission.\nDuring the American space station studies\nin the early 1970s, some European firms\nworked as subcontractors to American\ncompanies in formulating these new\nconcepts. Through the years the United\nStates entered nearly 1,000agreements with\nalmost 100 nations on space cooperation.\nBut most covered only a single project or\nother joint effort, such as the United States\nlaunching another nation\xe2\x80\x99s satellite or\ncarrying another nation\xe2\x80\x99s research instrument\naboard an orbiting U.S. spacecraft. Until\nSpacehb no agreement called for such a largescale joint development.\n\nEurope Studies Proposals\nWhen NASA offered Europe an opportunity\nto become a partner in one of the upcoming\nventures, European nations responded with\nenthusiasm. Discussions began between\nrepresentatives Of NASA and the two\nEuropean space agencies of that time-the\nEuropean Launcher Development\nOrganization ( ELDO) and the European\nSpace Research Organization (ESRO). Both\nlater merged into the present European\nSpace Agency (ESA).\nDiscussions over several years culminated\nin agreement that, rather than Europe\ncontributing some component of America\xe2\x80\x99s\nnewest delivery vehicle-the Shuttle-the\nUnited States would relinquish and\nEuropean nations would accept\nresponsibility for developing a discrete\nentity-a space laboratory to enhance the\nShuttle\xe2\x80\x99s capacity for carrying out important\nscientific research. Furthermore, both the\ntechnology and hnding required for such a\nsortie laboratory were well within ESA\xe2\x80\x99S\nmeans.\n\n70\n\nU\n\n#\n\nI\n\nP\n\nI\nUnloading Space1ab:\nCmmd ly pmtective\nshmudr with \xe2\x80\x9cESA\xe2\x80\x9dand\n%NO\xe2\x80\x9d markings,\nc o m p o ~ tofthe Spacelab\nr\n\nenginem.ng mdl arriving\noe\njhn Eumpe are unloa&d\nfiwn a C-5 transport\naivplane at the Kennedy\nSpace Center in Flurih.\n\nInternational Agreement Signed\nEuropeans and the United States made\ntheir decision final by signing the\nintergovernmental agreement in August\n1973. Nine of the European partners signed\nat that time; Austria joined the project later.\nThis document establishes the\nresponsibilities of each partner and assigned\nimplementation of the project to NASA in the\nUnited States and ESRO in Europe.\nMore specific and detailed statements\ngoverning the execution of the Spacelab\nprogram appear in another agreement signed\nat the same time. This is the Spacelab\nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU). The\nMOU was initialed on August 14, 1973, by\nNASA Administrator James Fletcher for the\nUnited States and by Alexander Hocker, ESRO\nrector-General, for the participating\nEuropean nations.\nThough the MOU concerned construction\nof a facility for research in the physical\nsciences in space, its signing marked the\nadvent of a greatly expanded international\ntechnical cooperation. To work out the\ncomplex technical aspects and management\nprocedures for this project required scores of\njoint meetings by American and European\nadministrators, scientists, engineers,\ntechnicians, and other specialists-as well as\nhv political leaders and eventually candidates\nthe flight crews.\nA manager at NASA headquarters in\nWashington, D.C., recalls the cosmopolitan\nnature of the gatherings: \xe2\x80\x9cThere were eleven\nof us with eight different mother tongues.\nFrom the outset we had all agreed that\ndiscussions and negotiations would be\ncarried out in English. We soon discovered\nthere were nine kinds of English-American\nEnglish, \xe2\x80\x98English\xe2\x80\x98 English, plus the seven\ndistinctive English accents of the\nrepresentatives of the other nations.\xe2\x80\x9d O f\ncourse the American English included some\nvery pronounced regional accents, which\nfrequently intrigued the Europeans.\n\nClose Relationships Develop\nMany of the participants in the meetings\nrecall that, in the give-and-takeof\nnegotiations, respect, understanding, and\neven admiration and personal friendships\ndeveloped among delegates of the 10\nparticipating European nations and\n\nrepresentatives of the United States.\nEuropeans, accustomed to more formal\nrelationships, adopted the practice of\naddressing Americans by their first names.\nAmericans accustomed to fast cafeteria\nlunches came to appreciate the relaxed\nEuropean midday meals.\nApproaches\nMany potentially intractable problems\narising from differing technological and\nadministrative procedures were gradually\novercome. Though Spacelab had to fit\nprecisely into the Orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s cargo bay, and\npower distribution and environmental\ncontrol systems had to match perfectly, the\nEuropeans retained their metric system and\nthe United States worked with the traditional\nEnglish system of measurements throughout\nthe project. Changing would have been\nprohibitively costly and would have required\nreplacement of vast quantities of expensive\nmeasuring tools and equipment.\nThe MOU clearly established that the\nEuropean nations would jointly design and\nbuild Spacelab and provide the first unit to\nNASA. NASA would have free use of it, but\nwould supply system and operational\nrequirements and Shuttle interfaces for the\nSpacelab system. NASA also was to provide\ntechnical and management advice, and, later\nin the project, buy a second complete\nSpacelab unit from the ESA consortium. The\nU.S. space agency also would manage all\nShuttle-Spacelabflights and operate the\nspaceborne laboratory units. This meant\nproviding buildings and workstands for\nassembling and checking out Spacelab\ncomponents for each flight, furnishing crew\ntraining and simulators, handling payload\nlogistics, and operating the control centers.\nThe first Spacelab flight was to be a\ncooperative mission. NASA and ESA would\neach be allowed to fly experiments of equal\ntotal weight and electric power needs. There\nwould be a European scientist in the crew.\nThereafter Spacelab would be available to all\nusers on cooperative or cost-reimbursable\nbases.\nOrdinarily ESA assigns funding quotas to\neach member nation based on relative gross\nnational products. In the Spacelab project\nWest Germany took the lead and contributed\nmore than half of the funds. Each\nparticipating nation expects to receive\nindustrial contracts closely matching its\ncontributions to a project.\n\nESA, NASA\n\n71\n\nESA Participation Apportioned\n\nWest Germany provided 53.3 percent of\nSpacelaps cost and fulfilled 52.6 percent of\nall Spacelab work contracts. The industrial\nfirm ERNO VFW Fokker, after submitting the\nwinning design, became the prime contractor\nfor Spacehb. At that time the company was\nowned by both West German and Dutch\ninterests. Since then ERNO has been taken\nover by the West German firm Messerschmitt\nBolkow Blohm. The ERNO plant in Bremen\ncontinued as the headquarters for Spacehb\ndesign, production management, component\ntesting, and assembly.\nWest Germany\xe2\x80\x99s mc-Telefunken provided\nSpaceWs electric power distribution system,\nand Dornier Systems built the life support\nequipment. With 18 percent of the\ncontributions to Spacehb and 13.1 percent*\nof the work contracts, Italy is the second\nlargest Spacehb participant. Italy\xe2\x80\x99s industrial\nfirm Aeritalia built the Spacelab module, all\nthe racks that fit inside, and the thermal\ncontrol system.\nFrance, with 10 percent of contributions\nand 12.2 percent of the contracts, was\nassigned the avionics systems, with the firm\nMATRAin charge. France also provided other\ncomponents, including the three Spacehb\ncomputers, which operate independently\nfrom the five American-built computers in\nthe Orbiter.\nThe United Kingdom, with 6.3 percent of\nthe contributions and 7.1 percent of\ncontracts, built the pallets, including those\ntwo that flew before sL-1. Belgium (4.2\npercent of contributions, 5 percent of\ncontracts) built the electrical ground support\nequipment and the Igloo structure. Spain\n(2.8 percent of contributions, 3.9 percent of\ncontracts) provided mechanical ground\nsupport equipment.

The IPS aims\nSpacelab telescopes and other instruments\nwith great precision.\nMore Than 2,000 Employed\nAt the height of manufacturing activities\nmore than 2,000 Europeans employed by\nmore than 40 contractors and subcontractors\nin Europe were working on Spacelab or its\ncomponent and support equipment.\nThe first Spacelab components to arrive in\nthe United States were three \xe2\x80\x9cengineering\nmodel\xe2\x80\x9d pallets. These arrived in 1979 after\nthey had been used in European ground\ntests. They were intended for use by NASA to\ntrain technicians and give them practice in\nmounting instruments on pallets. They were\nnot intended for flight. However, two of\nthem became the first Spacelab units to go\ninto space when one was used on the second\nShuttle flight (STS-2)in November 1981, and\nanother on the third Shuttle flight (STS-3) in\nApril 1982.\nA variety of Earth observation instruments\nwere mounted on that first pallet.\nInstruments to measure the space\nenvironment surrounding the Orbiter were\non the second pallet. They proved that\nexcellent scientific work could be performed\non pallets.\n\nf\n.\n*\n\nY\n\nModule Delivered\nNext to arrive in the United States was the\nengineering model of the habitable module.\nAs in the case of the pallets, this engineering\nmodel worked almost identically to a flight\nelement.

Acceptance\nof these flight articles by NASA as flightqualified had been completed two months\nbefore in Bremen.\nEchoing the thoughts and feelings of many\nof his fellow Europeans, ESA DirectorGeneral Erik Quistgaard told the assembled\ndignitaries and Spacelab workers from\nEurope and the United States at the Florida\nceremonies:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed a proud day for us Europeans.\nFor the first time we are offering NASA an\nessential part for one of its space programs.\nEurope has, for many years, either within the\nframework O ESA or in multilateral projects,\nf\ncontributed experiments and equipment to\nNASA programs, but never before have we\ndeveloped and built, as a joint European\nventure, such a major element of a NASA\nprogram. It is a great pleasure for us to hand\nthe first flight unit (of Spmehb) over to NASA\ntoday.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn reply, Vice President George Bush told\nthe European and American audience:\n\xe2\x80\x98We are returning to space together, and\nthat is no small achievement. Space Shuttle\nand SpaceZab represent a bond, not just of\ntransatlantic cooperation and friendship, but\nof a cooperation and friendship that will\nextend even beyond the Earth into space.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSpacelab arrives.

Participants\npronounced the acronym \xe2\x80\x9cJizzlewig.\xe2\x80\x9d The\nmeetings O JSLWG for management\nf\ncoordination between ESA and NASA are\ncochaired by the SpaceZab program directors\nat ESA in Paris and NASA headquarters in\nWashington, D.C. The meetings are also\nregularly attended by the SpaceZab project\nmanager of the European Space Research\nand Technology Center in Noordwijk, the\nNetherlands, and the NASA SpaceZab program\nmanager at the Marshall Space Flight Center.\nExperts from participating countries were\ninvited to attend JSLWG meetings for\ninformation exchanges and consultation\nwhile the Shuttle and Spatelab were being\n75\n\nbuilt, and to help with resolution of\nproblems that appeared during preparation\nfor operations.\nSixteen experts from ESA and its\ncontractors from six different countries have\nbecome members of a European Resident\nTeam ( ERT). They are living with their\nfamilies near the Kennedy Space Center\n( K S ~ ) This team is supplemented by ESA\n.\nspecialists flown in for short stays for\nconsultation on particular aspects of their\nexpertise. The ERT members have been\nmaking their experience available to NASA\nthrough assisting with development of\nmethods for assembling and checking out the\nSpacelab systems and by helping to solve\nsome of the problems that invariably arise\nwith complex new equipment. The ERT will\nstay at KSC at least through the first two\nSpacelab flights.\nMeanwhile, another temporary resident\nteam of 20 experts has been supporting the\nKennedy Space Center with the installation\nof the European research instruments to be\nused on board the first Spacelab flight.\n\nreleased into orbit and later retrieved by the\nShuttle, which may record data for later\nanalysis or transmit research results\nimmediately by radio.\nThese retrievable pallets and platforms\ncould be delivered to orbit for either long or\nshort exposures in space and returned to\nEarth for reuse with Shuttle. Eventually, a\nresuppliable space station designed for\nindefinite stay in orbit could be\nsupplemented by experiment-laden manned\nmodules and free-flying pallets resembling\nthose of Spacelab.\n\nMuch New Data Expected\nAnalysis and interpretation of some\nSpacelab-generatedscientific data may\nbecome available quickly after each flight.\nSome sorting, processing, and analysis may\ntake many months or even several years.\nThe vast quantities of research information\nemanating from Spacelabwill provide\nmaterial for scientific papers which\ninvestigators will publish in scientific\njournals or present at scientific meetings.\nScientific papers are a tangible end product\nPhllet Concept Emerges\nof scientific research, and Spacelab is expected\nto be the source of large quantities of them.\nLooking to the future, the orbiting\nSuch papers are the means by which research\nlaboratory has introduced concepts which\nresults come into possession of scientists\nwill undoubtedly influence the design of\neverywhere and through them become part\nspace activities in the decades ahead.
