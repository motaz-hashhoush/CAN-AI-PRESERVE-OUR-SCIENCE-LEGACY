The ASTM classes are used to represent part processing only and are unrelated.\n\n17\n\nSpaceflight Hardware NDT Considerations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It is incumbent upon the structural assessment community to\ndefine critical initial flaw sizes (CIFS) for the AM part to define the\nobjectives of the NDT.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Knowledge of the CIFS for AM parts will allow the NDE and\nfracture control community to evaluate risks and communicate\nmeaningful recommendations regarding the acceptability of risk.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CIFS defects shall be detected at the accepted probability of\ndetection (POD), e.g., 90/95, for fracture critical applications.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Demonstration of adequate part life starting from NASA-STD-5009\nflaw sizes is generally inappropriate for fracture critical, damage\ntolerant AM parts.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It is recognized that parts with high AM Risk may have regions\ninaccessible to NDT. To understand these risks it is important to\nidentify the inaccessible region along with the CIFS.\n\n18\n\nSpaceflight Hardware NDT Considerations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Parts with low AM risk should exhibit much greater coverage for\nreliable NDT.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multiple NDE techniques may be required to achieve full coverage.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Surface inspection techniques (PT and ECT, but also UT) may require\nthe as-built surface be improved to render a successful inspection,\ndepending upon the defect sizes of interest and the S/N ratio.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For PT, surfaces improved using machining or abrasion, for example,\nrequire etching prior to inspection to remove smeared metal.\nNote: removal of the as-built AM surface merely to a level of visually smooth may be\ninsufficient to reduce the NDE noise floor due to near-surface porosity and\nboundary artifacts.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NDT demonstration parts with simulated CIFS defects are used to\ndemonstrate NDT detection capability.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NDE standard defect classes for welds and castings welding or casting\ndefect quality standards will generally not be applicable for AM parts.\n\n19\n\nSpaceflight Hardware NDT Considerations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Relevant AM process defect types used must be considered.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 AM processes tend to prohibit volumetric defects with significant\nheight in the build (Z) direction. The concern instead is for planar\ndefects, such as aligned or chained porosity or even laminar cracks,\nthat form along the build plane. The implications of this are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 planar defects are well suited for growth\n\xe2\x80\xa2 planar defects generally have low contained volume\n\xe2\x80\xa2 the orientation of defects of concern must known before\ninspection, especially when detection sensitivity depends on the\ndefect orientation relative to the inspection direction\n\xe2\x80\xa2 the Z-height of planar defects can be demanding on incremental\nstep inspection methods such as CT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Until an accepted AM defect catalog and associated NDE detection\nlimits for AM defects is established, the NDE techniques and\nacceptance criteria remain part-specific point designs.\n\n20\n\nQualification & Certification/USAF\xef\x81\xb3FAA\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of qualification and certification procedures is an issue for NASA,\nUSAF, FAA and commercial aerospace\n\n21\n\nASTM E07.10\nSubcommittee on Specialized NDT Methods\nTaskgroup on NDT of Aerospace Materials\nNDT of AM effort\n\nE07.10 TG on NDT of Aerospace Materials\n\n23\n\nASTM E07-F42/ISO TC 261 Collaboration\nNDT of Additively Manufactured Aerospace Parts\n\n24\n\n24\n\nASTM E07 Work Item WK47031\n\n25\n\nCurrent WK47031 NDE on AM Draft\n\nGoal is to have a ready-for-ballot draft by the\nASTM E07 January meeting\n26\n\nNDT SMEs\nbeing sought\n\nCurrent ASTM WK47031 Scope\n\n27\n\nCurrent ASTM WK47031 Members\nNDT vendor\nUSAF\nUSAF\n\nISO TC 261\nGE Aerospace\nISO TC 261\nBoeing\nNDT vendor\nNDT vendor\nJAXA\n\nNDE and AM equipment\nmanufacturers, government\nagencies, academia, US and EU\nindustry represented\nGE Aerospace\nNDT vendor\nAerojet\nUSAF\nAM producer\nAM/NDT SME\n\nNew members welcome,\ncontact Jess Waller\nor Steve James!\n\nLMCO\nHoneywell\nESA\nAM SME\nNASA\nNASA\n\n28\nAM producer\n\nWK47031 Section Writing Teams\nIntro (Sections 1-5)\nLeads: James and Waller Collaborators: Sinnema, Moylan\n\nDefects (Section 4.3)\nLead: Dutton Collaborators: Walker\n\nIn-Process NDE\nin-situ Infrared Thermography (IR, Section 7)\nLead: Moylan Collaborators: Middendorf, Vergara, Burke, Zalameda, Taminger\n\nPost-Process NDE\nComputed Tomography (CT, Section 8)\nLead: Hunter Collaborators: ASTM E07.01, Martin, Jones\n\nEddy Current Testing (ECT, Section 9)\nLead: TBD Collaborators: Todorov, ASTM E07.07\n\npost-process Thermography (TT, Section 11)\nLead: Shepard Collaborators: TBD\n\nNeutron Diffraction (Section 12)\nLead: Curtis-Rouse, Collaborators: Watkins, Farrell\n\nPenetrant Testing (PT, Section 13)\nLead: Brausch Collaborators: TBD, ASTM E07.03\n\nProcess Compensated Resonance Testing (PCRT, Section 14)\nLead: Biedermann Collaborators: Hunter\n\nRadiologic Testing (RT, Section 15)\nLead: LaCivita (interim) Collaborators: TBD, E07.01\n\nOptical Metrology/Structured Light (OM, Section 16)\nLead: Waller Collaborators: MSFC, Wooliams, Cuypers\n\nUltrasonic Testing (UT, Section 17, includes PAUT)\nLead: James Collaborators: Koshti, Dutton, Djordjevic, ASTM E07.06\n\n2\n\n29\n\nNDE Detection of Typical AM Defects\n\n30\n27\n\nConceptual WK47031 Round Robin Samples\n\n31\n\nActual WK47031 Round Robin Samples\nNASA LaRC\nEBF3 samples\n\nGeorgia So.
