b"June 1970\n\n\t\n\nBrief 70-10313\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\nT \xe2\x80\xa2-'\t\n\n;:.\t\n\n.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs announce new technology derived from the U.S. space program. They are issued to encourage commercial\napplication. Tech Briefs are available on a subscription basis from the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical\nInformation, Springfield, Virginia 22151. Requests for individual copies or questions relating to the Tech Brief program may\nbe directed to the Technology Utilization Division, NASA, Code UT, Washington, D.C. 20546.\n\nUniversal Router Concept\nThe cutting process is one of routing chips of a\ncontrolled size to assure ease of chip collection. An\nimpeller on the router motor shaft directs the chips\ntoward the chip collector. The router is attached- to\nthe surface of the workpiece by a suction gasket on\nthe bottom of the cylindrical tool housing when operating in air, and by surface bonding when operating in\na vacuum.\n\nNotes:\n\nA portable universal router, as shown in the drawing, could perform such tasks as cutting holes of large\ndiameter and irregular shapes, machining recesses,\nand drilling holes with certain edge-distance limitations. Mounted perpendicularly above the workpiece\nis a high-speed electric router motor. The motor housing is mounted on the top of a cylindrical tool housing\nwhich rests on the workpiece. The housings are coupled so that the router may be moved in the x-y plane.\nThe router cutter is attached to and in line with\nthe motor shaft. Cutter depth control is provided\nthrough a micrometer adjustment on the motor housing. Hole and recess size and configuration are controlled by a template mounted on the tool housing,\nand are limited only by the availability of templates\nand by the size of the router itself. Close tolerance\ncontrol of hole dimensions, including square corners,\nis maintained by appropriate selection of roller size\nand cutting tool configuration. Rectangular and\nround holes may be cut without a template.\n\n1. Although originally conceived as a tool for use in\nspace, this router might also be employed as a general-purpose tool to aid in the on-site modification\nof large structures in construction trades or in heavy\nindustry.\n2. This development is in the conceptual stage only,\nand as.of the date of publication of this Tech Brief,\nneither .a model nor a prototype has been constructed.\n3. No additional information is available. Specific\nquestions, however, may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nHuntsville, Alabama 35812\nReference: B70-10313\n\nPatent status:\nInquiries about obtaining rights for the commercial\nuse of this invention may be made to NASA, Code\nGP, Washington, D.C. 20546.\nSource: W.
