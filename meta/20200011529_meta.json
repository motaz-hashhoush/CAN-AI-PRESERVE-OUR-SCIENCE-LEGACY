By the beginning of the 21st century, however, it became clear that more work was necessary. Heightened sensitivity to, and understanding of, the impact of aviation on the environment and the reduced availability of low-cost energy placed the spotlight directly on aircraft efficiency and reducing environmental impacts. This realization spawned one of NASA's most ambitious aviation projects to date - the Environmentally Responsible Aviation project.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20200011529, "publisher": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "id": "2b1c5a8445754e67acc891cc140479f9", "publicationDate": "2020-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/green-light-for-green-flight-tagged.pdf"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
