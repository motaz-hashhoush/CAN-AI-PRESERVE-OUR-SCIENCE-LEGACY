Spectral bands on the TM, particularly those at wavelengths of 1.6 and 2.2 micrometers are useful for: (1) distinguishing crops such as rice and soybeans; (2) surveying areas that are cultivated in strip crop fashion; (3) determining clay variations and abundances and rock classifications; and (4) differentiating nutrients and sediments found in coastal waters. The sensor can identify surface features 30 meters on a side, which roughly corresponds to a standard city block. Highway construction, land excavation, urban growth, and the health and extent of vegetation can be detected.", "title": "LANDSAT-4 hightlights", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T14:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830021484, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Williams, D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "67d91423226a4b21a9e1a103a4608f87"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19830021484, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830021484, "id": "348f424eff9342fe9f2edff7e22477bd", "publicationName": "LANDSAT-4 Sci.
