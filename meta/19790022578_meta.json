Gallium arsenide solar cells were considered but it could not be assured that the world gallium resources could support constructions of two solar power satellites per year. Therefore, for preliminary design an array blanket made from 5 by 10 cm silicon solar cells, 50 microns thick, and electrostatically bonded between borosilicate glass sheets was adopted. In annealing experiments, a radiated 50 microns thick cell was restored to its initial performance in a 500 C. Solar-cell efficiency effects significantly the solar power satellite mass, which varies from 90,000 metric tons for 20 percent cells to 120,000 metric tons for 12 percent cells. The anticipated cost of delivered power, based on 1977 dollars, varies from 4 cents per kWh with 18 percent cells, to 5 cents per kWh for 12 percent efficient cells.", "title": "Solar cells for solar power satellites", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T19:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19790022578, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Oman, H."}, "organization": {"name": "Boeing Aerospace Co.", "location": "Seattle, WA, United States"}}, "id": "2100db98c5154003b1d048ad597d06e3"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19790022578, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790022578, "id": "fc2e978eae0043ec97a637776ac99add", "publicationName": "ESA  Photovoltaic Generators in Space", "publicationDate": "1978-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
