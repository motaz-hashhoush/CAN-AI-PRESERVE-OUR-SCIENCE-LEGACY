This research has advanced to the point where, at the system level, parity with combustion engines, via vehicle weight and drag reductions to reduce battery requirements, along with continued battery research, can conceivably be achieved in less than 10 years.. Concomitantly, renewable electric generation, which would enable essentially emission-less transportation, has via cost reductions, efficiency improvements and storage research advanced to the point of producing 25% of current electrical generation and 62% of new generation capability with continued rapid cost reductions and consequent rapid further adoption projected. The present report examines the resultant electric aircraft possibilities and opportunities including technologies to reduce requisite battery size and weight via airframe performance improvements, the benefits of electric propulsion and the enablement of a massive new aeronautics market for affordable, safe personal air vehicles that operate off of local streets.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180006183, "id": "b24a30367cf648b6a0e25e1bcdfa1cd9", "publicationDate": "2018-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180006183.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180006183/downloads/20180006183.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180006183/downloads/20180006183.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180006183/downloads/20180006183.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
