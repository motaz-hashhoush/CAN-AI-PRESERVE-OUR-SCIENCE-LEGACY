Three fuel blends conforming to AN-F-58 specifications were prepared in order to determine the influence of fuel boiling temperatures and aromatic content on combustion efficiencies and altitude operational limits. The performance of the three AN-F-58 fuels was compared in the range of altitudes from sea level to 65,000 feet, engine speeds from 40- to 100- percent normal rated, and flight Mach numbers of 0.0 and 0.6. Similar information was obtained for AN-F-32 fuel at a flight Mach number of 0.0", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050019339, "id": "022cecd2bc9f48b5b9ccb1eff7b06d31", "publicationDate": "1949-07-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050019339.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050019339/downloads/20050019339.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050019339/downloads/20050019339.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050019339/downloads/20050019339.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
