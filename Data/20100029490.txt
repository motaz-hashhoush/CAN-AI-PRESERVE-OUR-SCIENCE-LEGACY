Patent No. 6,042, 964)\n\nInventors: Pramod K. Sharma,\nSekharipuram R. Narayanan, and\nGregory S. Hickey, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory\nThe invention provides a more direct\nand efficient way of utilizing heat to store\nelectrical energy than the solar panels\nmost spacecraft rely on. The heat is\ndirectly converted at high efficiency into\nstored chemical energy in a battery containing a thermally regenerable electrode. The battery contains at least one\nelectrode that intercalates a first species\nfrom the electrolyte in the first electrode\ncompartment to form a thermally\ndecomposable complex during discharge, while the other electrode supplies another species to the electrolyte in\nthe second electrode compartment. The\nthermally decompo able complex is stable at room temperature but is decomposable at temperatures of 50-150\ndegrees C (preferably 50-100 degrees C,\nsuitably 80 degree C). The electrode\ncompartments are separated by a selective ion-permeable membrane that is\nimpermeable to the first species.\n\nMethod for Forming Fiber\nReinforced Composite Bodies\nwith Graded Composition\nand Stress Zones\n(US. Patent No. 5, 945, 166)\n\nInventors: Mrityunjay Singh, Stanley\nR. Levin, and James A. Smialek, Lewis\nResearch Center\nFiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix\ncompo ites requiring thermal and environmental stability and good thermal\nhock resistance are commonly used for\ncombustion and exhaust components in\njet and rocket engines, ceramic burner\ninserts, and heat exchanger tubes. In\norder to serve their intended purpose,\nthese have to be operated at high temperatures and undergo mechanical and\nthermal stresses. Prior-art matrix compos-\n\nites are often microcracked due to the e\nstresses, and oxygen penetrates to the\nfiber-matrix interface through the e\ncracks. The interface and the fiber\nbecome oxidized, thereby leading to the\nfailure of the composite . The present\ninvention provides silicon carbide mallix\ncompo ites having means for ealing\nmatrix cracks so as to prevent oxygen and\ncorrosive gas ingre to the fibers and\ninterfaces. The method provides a refractory fiber preform, infiltrates it with a\nmixture selected from polymer/ resin,\ncures it at a temperature from about 60\n\xc2\xb7C to about 90 \xc2\xb7c, heats it at about 600 \xc2\xb7C\nto about 700 \xc2\xb7C in an inert environment\nso as to convert the mixture to carbon,\nand infiltrates the preform with molten\nmaterial selected from the group comprising molten silicon and binary siliconrefractory metal alloys.\n\nUse of Ultrasound to Improve\nthe Effectiveness of a\nPermeable Treatment Wall\n(US. Patent No. 6,013,232)\n\nInventors: Jacqueline W. Quinn,\nChristian A. Clausen, Cherie l.\nGeiger, Debra R. Reinhart, and Nancy\nRuiz, Kennedy Space Center\nRemediating groundwater sites contaminated with halogenated hydrocarbons\nwith technologies that attempt to remove\nthe contaminant from the subsurface and\npump it to a treatment system have had a\nlimited degree of success. Thus recent\nefforts have focused on physical, biological, or chemical treatment in situ. A permeable treatment wall (P1W) is an alternative remediation technology that does\nnot involve pumping. As contaminated\ngroundwater is canied through the wall by\nthe natural gradient, halogenated olvents\nare chemically altered to acceptable alternative species. Emerging on the downstream side of the wall is contaminant-free\ngroundwater. The invention also provides\nfor inserting an ultrasonic radiation-generating transducer into the subsurface in\nor near the wall. P1Ws are designed to\nhave a greater permeability than the surrounding soils, and are typically constructed using a high-permeability sand mixture\nbearing a zero-valent metal.\n\nFor more information on the inventions described here, contact the approjmate NASA Field\nCenter\'s Commercial Technology OJf :e.

Their structure is usuaUy a matrix format resembling a\ncheckerboard.\nNTB: What advantages do matrix symbols have over conventional bar codes?\n\nSchramm: Bar codes and matrix symbols boili encode information so that a\ncomputer, through the use of a reading\ndevice, can understand the information\ndirectly. But bar codes are limited in size\nreduction due to certain ratios of wide\nand narrow elements that must be present for readers to decode them. They\nare also limited to paper label and\nprinted media due to tl1e contrast required by laser canners. A matrix symbol\nis read by a CCD camera, which captures\nthe entire image to decode ilie pattern.\nThis enables symbol capture from a wide\nvariety of surfaces, including metals. Matrix symbols can be marked on microchip and read through a microscope,\nor cover the tops oflarge containers to be\nread from a great distance.\nNTB: What applications has NASA considered for this teclmology?\n\nSchramm: The original intent for tudying liis technology centered on improved\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nconfiguration management of flight hardware and improved flight safety. Using Automatic Identification Tracking (AlT) was\nan approach to eliminate ilie data errors\nin ASA\' vast databases, while making\ndata capture as efficient as checking out at\nthe grocery store.\nNTB: Wby did NASA initially decide\nDot to adopt the technology, and will it be\nimplemented in the future?\n\nSchramm: Most of the early meliods\ndeveloped for direct part marking of\ncompressed symbology did not meet lie\ncriteria for safety. Studies showed that\nmarking ilie surface of a part changed its\ncharacteristics, and lie identification\nmark was considered a controlled defect.\nAs lie technology evolved, we continued\nto develop permanent marking meliods\nfor applying small matrix symbols liat\nwould be as safe as or safer lian tl1e\nprocesses liat are accepted today. Tests\nare underway to deliver ilio e processes\nduring 2000. The ASA Direct Part\nMarking Standard and Handbook are expected to be made available this year. Direct part marking and AIT will playa future role in flight safety. And we even\nhave answers to lie questions about\nflight hardware that has been covered\nwili paint or foam. We are developing\nmarking meiliods and lie prototype devices to read matrix symbols lirough\ncoatings and even wiiliin ilie assembly.\nNTB: What are some commercial\napplications?\n\nSchramm: NASA findings spurred additional te ring by lie Department of Defense (DoD) and plivate industry liat resulted in electing tl1e Data Matrix\nsymbol for parts marking by the Automated Identification Manufacturers\n(AIM) and ilie American ational Standards Institute (ANSI). Adcti tional partmarking tandards quickly followed as ilie\nautomotive, electronics, pharmaceutical,\nand aircraft industries adopted the symbol. The symbol is found on many of ilieir\nproducts, and its use is being required on\nfirst- and second-tier uppliers, for example, in ilie aircraft industry.\nA full transcript of this interoiew appears\nonline at Wl1IW.nasatech. cotn.

Working\nwith Honeywell of Tempe, AZ, integrator\nof the 270-VDC linear actuator system,\nThomson Saginaw supplied a ball screw\nassembly that provides:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dual redundant drive capability;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An "internal crossover" ball recirculation system, contained completely within the ball nut body;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Custom multiple-circuit thrust bearings at each end (connection point) of\nthe ball screw; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A combination of specialty stainless\nsteels and plating technology for maximum environmental/high-temperature resistance.\nThe use of ball screws in flight control\napplications is well founded. Linear actuators incorporating ball screws are used\nin applications including the flap\nand/or slats of many aircraft, including\nthe B-747, B-757, A-31O, and C141 aircraft. They are also used in many horizontal stabilizer applications in many of\nthe arne aircraft and in others such as\nthe B-777, Embraer 145, and KC135. In\naddition, many space applications such\nas rocket engine and atellites utilize\nball screws in linear actuation. The chal-\n\nController\n\n,--------..,\n270Vdc\n\nlenge of the X-33 design was to integrate\nall the nece sary technology to meet\nunique requirements.\nPerformance requirements for the X-33\nincluded a maximum operating load of\n25,000 lb., a 48,OOO-lb. limit load, 0 to\n+350-\'F operating temperature range, 5minute exposures to 500 OF at the rod end,\nand dual.<frive capability. Also required\nwas a 90-percent minimum mechanical\nefficiency of the ball screw and O.OO~in. to\n0.007-in. axial lash (free play) between rod\nend and ball nut The harsh environment\ndictated that the materials used would\nneed to be as inert as possible.

A dual-channel LVDT arrangement provide Linear\npo ition feedback (ee Figure 1). To\naccommodate the dual-drive requirement, the ball crew assembly wa\nde igned with y tern attachments at\nboth the ball- crew end (drive y tern 1)\nand the ball nut outer diameter (drive\ny tern 2).\nThe crew shaft is "fixed" relative to\neither drive ystem, and the ball nut i\nalway the tran lating member. For\ninstance, operation of the first drive\ntern will re ult in rotation of the crew\nshaft and tran lation of the ball nut.\nWith the second drive system operating\nand the fir t stationary, the ball nut will\nrotate and translate simultaneously\nalong the screw haft. This is accomplished through a low-friction sliding\ninterface between the ball nut outer\ndiameter and the econd drive system.\nAt this interface, a silver-plated involute\nspline transmits operating torque and\nallow for liding ( ee Figure 2) .\nMany conventional ball- crew designs\nuse external steel tubes for recirculation\nof the bearing ball. In the X-33 assembly, internal "crossover"-type ball returns\nwere used to minimize the diametra1\nenvelope and provide a mass-balanced\nassembly. This i particularly important\nin sy tern requiring that the ball nut be\ndriven (rotated). The de ign called for\nan exceptionally long ball nut (to provide the required 7 inches of travel\nacros the involute spline in the event\nthat operation of the second drive ystern was required) .

What resulted was the development\nof a nine-circuit thrust bearing that significantly reduced deflections down to\nan acceptable level (see Figure 3).\nApplied (dynamic) loads were predicted to range from several hundred\npounds to 48,000 lb. on this actuator.\nThis results in a large variation in mean\nHertzian stre e, from less than 100 kSI\nto greater than 500 kSI, in the thrust\nbearing, swivel joint, and ball screw\nrace . To understand operational characteristics across this stress realm, several developmental tests were conducted.\nBoth mechanical efficiency (for the ball\nscrew) and coefficient of friction (for\nthe nine-circuit thru t bearing and swivel joint) were quantified across this\nrange. From this data, the appropriate\nball ize, race geometry, and material\ncondition were derived. The final design\nprovided 90.5-percent minimum ballscrew efficiency and 0.00294 maximum\ncoefficient of friction in the thrust bearing and swivel joint under a 48,000-Ib.\n(535 kSI Hertzian stress) operating load.\nThomson Saginaw used its TSS3165 stain Ie s steel for the swivel\nBall nut\njoint/ rod end, ball nut extension\ntube, and crew shaft.

For this purpo e, nine circuits of\nbearing balls are in erted through retainers into bearing raceways ground into\nthe extension tube\'s inner diameter and\nrod-end outer diameter. A stainless steel\nsleeve covering all retainers and a fluoroelastomer seal at the rotating interface\nkeep contaminants out of the assembly.\nThe ball-groove geometry, ball ize, and\nball quantity used in the swivel joint were\n"balanced" with that of the ball screw for\nequal load capacity and endurance life\n( ee Figure 3) .\nDuring development te ting, it was\ndetermined that conventional thrust\nbearing technology, originally used at\nthe screw shaft drive attachment, was\ninadequate.

These\nanomalous transient events can mask\nbearing signature and prevent reliable\ndetection of bearing faults.

By eliminating the\nneed for the rotation tables, the proposed method could reduce the cost of\ncalibration. Moreover, inasmuch as the\nnumber of gyroscopes that a rotation\ntable can hold is limited, the elimination of the rotation tables method\nwould make it possible to test more\ngyroscopes simultaneously.\nThe proposed method is based on the\nunique principle of operation of a\nmicromachined vibratory microscope.\nThis principle involves electrostatic excitation, capacitive sensing, and feedback\ncontrol of vibrations of a microscopic\nbody designed so that its vibrational\nmodes are affected by the Coriolis force.\nOne of the feedback control signals is a\nnegative feedback signal for generating\nan electrostatic actuation force that\ncompensates for the Coriolis force. In\nthe proposed method, one would superimpo e a imulated Coriolis-force signal\non the electrostatic actuation signal.\nBecause signals representing the real\nand simulated Coriolis forces would be at\nthe same frequency and phase, the gyr<:r\nscope circui try would respond to the simulated Coriolis force in the same way in\nwhich it would respond to the real\nCoriolis force. Hence, rotational testing\nwould not be necessary because one\ncould simply inject the simulated Coriolisforce ignal into the feedback control\nloop to make the vibrations and the ass0ciated electronic ignals behave as though\nthe gyroscope were undergoing rotation.\nThe figure i a block diagram of an\nelectronic\ntern for implementing the\n\nmethod. The drive-motion excitation circuit would measure the drive motion\n(one of twO vibratory motions involved in\nthe basic principle of operation) and\nwould provide an excitation force to sustain this motion. The sen ing-motion\nclosed loop would provide electrical\ndamping of the sensing motion (the\nother vibratory motion involved in the\nbasic principle of operation). The feedback control signal, t~, would produce\nan electrostatic actuation force equal to\nthe real Coriolis force plus the simulated\n(rotation-simulating) Coriolis force. The\ndemodulation circuit would demodulate\na sensing-motion force-rebalancing signal with the drive-motion signal to generate a signal proportional to the rate of\nrotation. During the simulation of rotation, the sensing-motion closed loop and\nthe demodulation circuit would respond\nas though to a real rotation signal.\nOf course, the value of this method of\ncalibration would depend on the accuracy with which the simulated Coriolisforce signals could be made to duplicate\nthe effects of the real Coriolis force. It\nwould be necessary to perform conventional inertial calibration to verify the\nproposed method.\nThis work was done by R.vrnan Guti.emz\nand Tony K Tang oj Ca.Uech Jar NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

And\nthe potential uses of this technology reach far beyond the limits of space.\n\nreating a realistic simulation of the\nhuman body represents a set of challenges as complex as the body it portrays. But scientists at NASA\'s Johnson\nSpace Center (JSC) in Houston, TX, are\ndoing just that - integrating computer\nsoftware and virtual reality (VR) technologies to simulate an actual human.\nThe project, known as the Somatic Sciences Simulation (S3) Project, is based\non Virtual Interactive Anatomy (VIA)\ntechnology. VIA originates from the Visible Human Project commissioned by\nthe National Library of Medicine. That\nendeavor produced a database representing digital imagery of the structure\nof male and female human bodies cut\ninto precise sections.\nVIA technology includes proprietary\nsoftware and creative peripheral devices\nthat produce a model with structural\nand functional attributes, an interactive\ndesign to customize anatomic and physiologic features, and the interactivity is\nmultisensory. The virtual human and its\nenvironment appear photo-realistic, and\none can move and touch the virtual\nhuman, thanks to a haptic computer interface device. Using the device, one can\ndistinguish body parts by pushing on\nthat part - and can even feel the pulse\nof the virtual human.\nThe shape change of a contracting\nmuscle and the stretching of a ligament\nduring vigorous activity are examples of\nhuman body characteristics that can be\nmeasured, mathematically described,\nand graphically modeled and displayed\nin VIA software routines.

Each display panel would contain an active-pixel\nsensor (APS) [or possibly another advanced image sensor] that would look\noutward from the panel through an\naperrure that would occupy only a small\nfraction of the area of the panel. The\nblanket would also contain a wiring harness that would include a cross-connected fiber-optic network, through\nwhich the image from each APS would\nbe transferred to a complementary display panel on the opposite side of the\ncloaked object\nThe positions and orientations of all\nthe image sensors would be slaved to the\nposition and orientation of one image\n\nsensor that would be de ignated a master imager.

Depending on the details of a\ngiven flow problem and the algorithm\nchosen to solve it, the numerical speed\nof sound mayor may not equal the physical speed of ound.\nThe numerical speed of sound has\nbeen found to be very useful in constructing upwind numerical-solution\nschemes to satisfy certain criteria. [As\n\nused in this special context, "upwind "\n(as distinguished from "central" or\n"downwind") refers to a manner of approximating spatial derivatives of flow\nquantities by taking differences between\ndiscretized flow quantities at locations\nbiased toward the upwind ide with respect the location of immediate interest.] An especially notable criterion is\nthe capability for exact capturing of contact and shock discontinuities in one-dimensional flows. The concept of the numerical speed of sound can also be\nextended to apply to the computation of\nlow-speed (in effect, incompressible)\nflows. In such an application, a caling\nfactor that varies with speed is introduced. As a result, the numerical dissipation decreases with the flow speed\n\nH\n\nH\n\nspaced curves.\n\n32\n\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nASA Tech Briefs, AUgusl 2000\n\n$- Special Coverage: Simulation/Virtual Reality\nmAbie Tedmologie , Cambridge,\nDeskLOp force feedback system with\n3-D Touch \xe2\x84\xa2 that connects to a computer via an extended parallel POlt.\nThe fOI-ce feedback system senses\nmotion in ix degrees of freedom,\nproviding a realistic sense of 3D\ntouch for design application .

Contamination\nfrom both point sources (e.g.,\nthrusters and vents) and diffu e\nources (e.g., reflected plumes or outgassing of materials) can be analyzed.\nASAN has been used to perform the\nasse sments reported in the ISS incremental-de ign-review documents.\nNASAN consi ts of several interactive tools (subroutines) that are linked\ntogether into a single, modular computer program that takes advantage of\ncommon program elements, which\ninclude manipulation of geometric\nmodel and plotting of results of\ncomputations. The central program\ncomponents are designed to be easily\n\n44\n\nexpandable to perform additional\nanalyse.\nNASAN includes ray-tracing subroutine that are efficient mean for calculating surface shadowing within\nthe various program application\nmodules. A variety of mathematical\nmodel of plumes can be easily called\nfrom the application modules. Two\nof these plume models calculate surface view factors, as needed, so that\ncontamination calculations can proceed efficiently.\nBecause geometric models with as\nmany a 25,000 surfaces can be analyzed , the fidelity achievable by use of\nNASAN is greater than that achievable\nwith software developed previously for\nthe arne purpo e.

There is a large body\nof data from previous research on the\nperformance and plume characteristics\nof electric propulsion devices; these data\nare available to support continuing efforts to understand the reaction kinetics\nand growth chemistry of diamond. One\nlogical extension of the prior re earch\nwould be an assessment of electric\nthrusters, other than dc-arget thrusters,\nfor their potential to increase rates of deposition even further. MPD thrusters are\namong tho e that could be considered.\nRegarded as thrusters, MPD ources\nhave been found to perform with low efficiency at power levels below a hundred\nkilowatts. However, some characteristics\nof the di charge and plume from MPD\nsources indicate that the e ource\nmight be well suited to synthesis and deposition of diamond at rates higher and\nover areas larger than tho e achievable\nby u e of dc-arget ource; the characteristics of particular relevance in this regard are higher levels of dissociation\nand ionization of gas in the core of the\n46\n\nMethane\nInjector\n\n7\n\nSubstrate\n\nPlume\nBoundary\n\nAnode\n\nFigurel .

Methane serves as a carbon precursor for deposition of\ndiamond and is injected just downstream\nof the anode plane through a molybdenum tube. Farther downstream, a walercooled copper mount supports a removable molybdenum disk that serves as a\nsubstrate for deposition of diamond (see\nFigure 2).

One of the most\nimportant characteristics that must\nbe measured is antenna propagation\nin certain stable conditions. Murata\nElectronics, a wholly owned subsidiary of\nMurata Manufacturing Co., of Japan, is\nmeeting this need with a unique and\ninnovative piece of microwave test\nequipment.

Hence, by processing the readouts\nfrom the pixels in this row at different times, one could obtain a time-resolved spectrum of the target.\n\nTwo-dimensional active-pixel-spectral\nlidar (TAPSL) is a proposed remote-sensing technique for obtaining spatially,\nspectrally, and temporally resolved information about terrain or other targets.\nOperating aboard an airborne or spaceborne platform above the Earth or a\nremote planet, a TAPSL system would be\nused to gather data on geological, biological , and chemical phenomena that\nmanifest themselves through characteIistic optical emission spectra.\nA TAPSL system would include a singlefrequency laser tllat would illuminate a\ntarget. The light returning from the target\nwould include an elastically scattered\ncomponent (the spectral component at\nthe original laser frequency) that could be\nused for ranging as in conventionallidar.\nThe return would also include inela tically scattered (Raman.,shifted and fluorescent) pectral components that would be\n\ncharacteIistic of the target material in\nresponse to excitation by the laser.\nThe light returning from the target\nwould be detected by a rectangular array\nof active-pixel sensors (APSs) that would\nbe sensitive to visible and near-infrared\nlight. The APS would operate in conjunction with miniaturized electronic\ncontrol, readout, and pixel-data-processing circuits. Before impinging on the\nAPS array, the light would pass through a\ndiffraction grating oriented to disperse\nthe light along the rows of pixels.\nConsequently, the frequency or wavelength of the light received by each pixel\ncould be identified from the position of\nthe pixel along its row (see figure).\nOptionally, the system could be operated\nwithout the laser to obtain the reflectedsunlight spectrum and/ or the thermal\nspectrum of the target.\nAs descIibed thus far, the system would\n\ndeIive information about the relative\nposition of the target in the manner of\nconventional lidar. However, if a lens\nwere used to image the target scene onto\nthe APS, then the position of each pixel\nalong a column could be used to obtain\nspatial resolution along the corresponding axis on the target; this approach\ncould be useful if the laser beam did not\nprovide sufficient resolution, or if it were\ndesired to scan the terrain in "pushbroom" fashion. Alternatively, it might be\npossible to vary the time gate of each\npixel with position along each column to\nobtain additional resolution for ranging\nor spectral analysis.\nThis work was done IJy Qy,iesup Kim of\nCalteeh for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

In some applications (e.g.,\norne microwave- ignal-proce sing appLications), it is po sible to use passive\ntemperature-compensating attenuators,\nwhich are preferable to active attenuators in that the passive de\\;ces are more\nreliable and maller, and their re ponses\nto signals are more nearly linear (they\ndo not introduce intermodulation distortion or harmonics).\nThe improved pas ive temperaturecom pen ating attenuators were developed because users expressed a need for\ndegrees of temperature compensation\ngreater than those afforded by pre\\iously\navailable passive temperature-compensating attenuators. Ideally, in a typical application, a temperature-compensating attenuator intended for use in a specified\ntemperature range would function with\nno 10 (no attenuation) at the highe t\ntemperature in the range and with maximum loss at the lowest temperature in\nthe range. While none of the improved\nattenuators performs in this ideal mannel~ it is notable that they can be made to\npre ent constant input and output\nimpedances, and their temperature coefficients of attenuation (TCAs) are tailorable.

The capability of the AEXS to\noperate in air and to be brought to a urface to be analyzed makes it unnecessary\nto bring a pecimen to a laboratory and\nprepare the specimen for analysis.\nThe AEXS belong to a class of miniature instruments that perfonn in situ elemental composition analysis by the excitation and analysis of x-ray fluorescence\nfrom specimens. Prior techniques\ninclude excitation of the x-ray fluorescence by a particles and x rays, both of\nwhich entail larger target areas and\nlonger spectrum acquisition times than\nthe electron beam based excitation u ed\nin the AEXS. The AEXS is predicted to\nbe able to analyze samples at high spatial\nresolution detennined by its controllable electron-beam pot size.

This rectenna\ncontains nine square microstrip patch\nantenna elements in a square array. The\nantenna can utilize incident radiation\nwith polarization components parallel to\neither or both sides of the square because\nthe circuitry under each patch includes\ntwo independent rectifiers - one for each\npolarization component. The dc output\nterminals of the two rectifiers under each\npatch are connected in series, and the\nseries rectifier pairs of all patches are connected in series. Consequently, the maximum output voltage (obtainable in the\nspecial case of circularly polarized incident radiation) can be 18 times that generated by a single-rectifier, single-polarization patch element.\nEach microstrip patch antenna element is supported over a ground plane\nby a layer of lightweight foam with a low\n(1.07) permittivity. Microstrip feed circuitry, rectifier diodes, and de conductors that collect the output power are\nlocated below the ground plane.\nMicrowave energy i coupled from the\nantenna elements to the feed circuitry\nthrough apertures or coupling slots.\nExcept for this aperture coupling. the\nantenna and the microstrip feed circuitry\nare divorced [Tom each other.\nThe placement of the feed and rectifier\ncircuitry below the ground plane makes it\npossible to isolate the rectifier circuitry\nfrom direct exposure to the incident\nmicrowave energy and thus prevents spurious coupling of microwave energy onto\nthe dc conductors. The ground plane also\nprevents the direct reradiation of the harmonics that are generated by the diodes as\nunavoidable byproducts of rectification. A\nmicros trip line filter is used to prevent\nradiation back through the aperture feed.\nYet another advantage of mounting the\nrectifier circuitry below the ground plane\nis that the ground plane serves as an effective thermal sink for the diodes. The\nground plane is not a single conductive\nElectronics Tech Briefs, August 2000\n\nFor More Information Circle No. 454\n\nCUSTOM EMI FILTERS\n.1\n\nFOR MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Look to an Industry leader with 40 years\nof proven experience\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Solutions fur unique filter requirements\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Complete design engineering and test\ncapabilities\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In-house manufacturing lndudlng Inductor\nand capadtor winding\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Serving the mllltary.

As explained below, the use of gap welding\npreforms would help to ensure consistency of the ribbon connections and\n. would reduce the time necessary for\nmaking the connections.\nIn the situation that inspired the\nproposal, gold ribbons 0.025 in. (0.64\nmm) wide and 0.001 in. (0.025 mm)\nthick must be formed and attached to\nRF circuiLry under a micro cope up to\n0.6 in. (15 mm) deep into RF housings. A ribbon must be manually held\nin place and formed to the required\nstrain-relief arch between connection\npoints by use of tweezers and other\nsmall tools, according to the best\njudgement of a technician. The ribbon\nis attached by u e of a gap welding machine that includes small probes for\nplacing welds. The technician\'s view of\nthe ribbon through the microscope\ncan be limited, especially inasmuch as\nside viewing is usually not possible.\nSometimes, this difficult forming-andattachment procedure inadvertently\nre ults in exce sive strain-relief arch,\nwhich can degrade the RF signal and\n\nthu make it neces ary to rework the\nconnection.\nA gap welding preform would be\nmade of a material that could hold a\npredetermined sbape and could be easily removed after use without causing\nany deterioration of the welded ribbon\nor the surrounding material. For example, a gap welding preform could be\nmade of a thickened acrylic compound\nsimilar to that used for conformal coating of circuit boards. Thickeners and\nolidifiers could be mixed into the material to facilitate extrusion into various\npredetermined shapes. A gap welding\npreform for a given application would\nbe haped so that a ribbon laid on it\nduring a forming-and-attachment procedure would end up shaped in the\nstrain-relief arch required for that\napplication.\nThe steps in the use of a gap welding\npreform would be the following:\n1. The preform would be cut to a length\ngreater than the width of the ribbon\nto be attached.\n2. The preform would be placed between the connection poinlS in the\ncircuit path.\n3. The ribbon would be formed over the\npreform (see figure) and one end of\nthe ribbon would be welded in place.\n\n4. The ribbon would be examined to determine whether it was in the desired\nshape and, if nOl, would be reformed\nas necessary.\n5. The ribbon would be welded in place\nat the end not previously welded.\n6. The preform would be dis olved by\na suitable solvent (e.g., alcohol) and\nthe ribbon connection would be inspected.

AUgusl 2000\n\n~ Improved\n\nUnidirectional Cell-Stretching Device\n\nCells can be stretched controllably, without removing them from a culture medium.\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn improved stretching device has\nbeen developed for use in research on\nthe effects of unidirectional loading on\nhuman and animal cells. The device is\ncapable of applying or removing a load\n(a controlled amount of stretch) on\ncommand to mimic the loading or unloading experienced by skeletal muscles\nand other tissues of interest.\nThis device is designed to overcome the\ndeficiencies of three cell-stretching devices that were commercially available at\nthe time of reporting the information for\nthis article. In the present device as in the\ncommercial devices, a cell culture is\ngrown on a coated sheet of silicone rubber that is immersed in a culture medium\nand the sheet is stretched to apply the de-\n\nsired load. One of the commercial devices\ncan apply the load only in discrete steps\nand must be removed from the culture\nmedium to change to a different load\nstep. The other two commercial devices\ncontain circular silicone membranes that\nare deformed in such ways that the resulting stretches include radial components\nand are thus not the desired unidirectional stretches. The present device need\nnot be removed from the culture medium\nand produces a continuously adjustable,\ntruly unidirectional stretch.\nThe silicone rubber sheets in the present device are in the form of rectangular strips coated with an extracellular matrix compound (Le., collagen Type I) .\nThe strips are arranged parallel to each\n\nFunctioning Prototype Design\nRigid Plastic\n\n, !:\\\nJ\nI\n\nSilicone\xc2\xb7 Rubber\nStrip\n\nCulture\nMedium\n\nMicroprocessor\xc2\xb7\nControlled\nPump\n\nSilicone-Rubber Strip Coaled With an\nExtracellular Matrix Material\n\nGas-Permeable\nPlug\n\nReservoir (Sealed\nChamber of Piston)\n\nRam Arm\n\nThis Unidirectional Cell Stretcher incorporates several improvements over commercially available cell\nstretchers.\n\nASA Tech BriefS, August 2000\n\nwww.nasatech .com\n\nother with their long axes laid out along\nthe axis of a round cylindrical ram (see\nfigure) . By use of removable pins, the\nends of the strips are attached to the\nends of the ram at equal circumferential\nintervals. This design makes it possible to\ngrow cells on the strips in standard tissue\nculture plates to the required cell density\nor differentiation state before placing\nthe strip in the cell stretcher. This design\nalso offers the advantage of ease of removal of the cells for examination at the\nend of the stretching procedure.\nThe ram assembly with the strips attached is inserted in a tissue-culture vessel that contains a culture medium. The\nstretching actuator in the ram is a\nsealed-chamber piston. Stretching along\nthe cylindrical axis is effected by injection of a sterile fluid into the sealed\nchamber by use of a pump controlled by\na microprocessor. (The pump is situated\noutside the culture vessel.) Reversal of\nthe injection flow results in a decrease in\nthe amount of stretch. The rate of\nstretching or unstretching is controlled\nby controlling the rate of flow.\nAccording to a proposed alternative\ndesign of this device, the ram would be\nadvanced by a screw drive actuated by a\nmicroprocessor-controlled stepping motor. According to another proposed alternative design, the cell stretcher would\nbe built into a tissue-culture vessel that\nwould include a heater, a temperature\nsensor, ports for exchange and/ or sampling of the culture medium, a pon for\ninfusion of gas, a pressure ensor, gas\nsensors, and optical ports for observation\nof cells during the loading procedure.\nThis work was done by Daniel L.

Thi ystem use CLIP [the\nC-Language Integrated Production System] knowledge-based rule derived\nfrom real-time data supplied by a sheep\nmodel. Although this S) tem is one of\neveraJ current aJarm-management software systems, it i vastl superior to the\ncommercial oftware S) terns designed to\nperform the same or imilar function .\nCommercial oftware systems of this\ntype monitor faults that occur above or\nbelow preset thresholds. Thre hold ettings may vary, but the monitors are unable to detect faults "intelligently. n\nThey are, in effect, hampered by preset\nNASA Tech Briefs, Augusl 2000\n\nvalue and can mistake thre hold issues\nfor life-endangering malfunctions. Because of this possibility of en-or, an\nalarm must always be treated as a eriou matter, whether or not there is a\nmalfunction. In an operating room,\nwhen an alarm warns of a po sible malfunction, the urgical procedure can\nbe di rupted. Without intelligent oftware already in place, surgical team\nmembers must verify that a malfunction has indeed occun-ed, or will occur,\nthus increasing both their own response time and the ri k to the patient.\nA change i needed.\nAn artificial-intelligence oftware system that can detect and define faults accurately while it monitors patients on\ne ophageal intubation and ane thesia\nmachines would decrease re pon e\ntime and reduce risks to patients.\nCLIPS, the artificial-intelligence software designed at jSC, i a decision-support tool that can effect this change bewww.nasalech.com\n\ncause CLIPS can be taught to determine\nthe parameter of machine .\nBasically, an artificial neural network\nimplemented in software in a computer\nmimics the thought processes of the\nhuman brain. CLIPS follows pathways of\nreasoning, very like human thought\nprocesses, to eliminate po ibilities. To\nsuppon CUPS, data are needed to design\na program unique to the esophageal-intubation and ane thesia-machine environment; it is from these data that intelligent\nsoftware can learn. The task for the team\nof scientists was LO gather these data. For\nthem, gathering data was an integral part\nof the development of the needed artificial-intelligence software system. The scientists selected a heep model from which\nto elicit real-time data.; from this model,\nthe team compiled clinical annotation to\nvalidate their oftware S) tern - aU \\~ith\xc2\xad\nout risk to human patients.\nOther artificially intelligent system\nfail to provide imilar annotations. For\n55\n\nexample. one prototype imulator that\nenables users to control and monitor an\nanesthesia delivery system re emble the\nJSC software. However, because all of its\ndata and faults are simulated, it lacks the\nvalidation of real-time data. In hort, no\nanimal-model te ting was done for this\nprototype. Thus, the major limitation of\nthis and other currently available systems is the impossibility of validating\nthem in environments in which they can\nbe u ed without interfering with normal\nroutines or endangering patients. Yet\nthe user-interface design is critical, and\nartificial-intelligence software can learn\nfrom the results of animal-model te ting.\nDuring the team effort, advances in\nartificial-intelligence software were applied to develop an expert system that\ncould provide, to medical personnel. decision support on the condition of the\npatient and tlle anesthesia machine. The\nrules of the knowledge-based domain\n\nwere defined by data extracted from various ources, including supporting literature, medical experts, and the heep\nmodel. The prototype oftware that\nemerged from this proce is still in an\nearly stage of de elopmen~ it will be\ntested further by users in a laboratory.\nThe data generated by the sheep model\nwill be analyzed and, if the analysis warrants, the design of the user interface\nwill be modified. The inventors believe\nthat more data should be collected, and\nhope to test 20 to 30 additional sheep to\nrefine the quality of the expert-system\nrules being written. This would enable\nthe validation of the software in real\ntime to determine sen itivity and specificity in recognizing alarm conditions.\nCUPS-based software can detect malfunctions in esophageal intubation and\nanesthesia machines becau e the software uses the sheep model to provide\nreal-time data from which knowledge-\n\nbased rules are built. Because the reported malfunction will be genuine,\nthi\ntern will reduce re pon e times.\nThe use of the real-time data from the\nheep model sets this software system\napart from other, commercially available\nartificial-intelligence software systems of\nthis type. Once the sheep model has\nbeen fully demonstrated, the scientists\nanticipate that tlle system will be tested\non human patients - in a way that does\nnot interfere with patient care and adheres to tandard medical practices.\nThis work was done Ify Todd T.
