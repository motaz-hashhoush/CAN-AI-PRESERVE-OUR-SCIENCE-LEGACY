In this paper, a combined transport-kinetics model for growth of calcium oxalate crystals is presented. The model is used to parametrically investigate the growth of renal calculi in urine with a focus on the coupled effects of transport and surface reaction on the ionic concentrations at the surface of the crystal and their impact on the resulting growth rates. It is shown that under nominal conditions of low solution supersaturation and low Damkohler number that typically exist on Earth, the surface concentrations of calcium and oxalate approach their bulk solution values in the urine and the growth rate is most likely limited by the surface reaction kinetics. But for higher solution supersaturations and larger Damkohler numbers that may be prevalent in the microgravity environment of Space, the calcium and oxalate surface concentrations tend to shift more towards their equilibrium or saturation values and thus the growth process may be limited by the transport through the medium. Furthermore, parametric numerical studies suggest that changes to the renal biochemistry of astronauts due in space may promote development of renal calculi during long duration space expeditions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130011628, "endDate": "2012-07-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "65143a613c8b45a4819a1c2ad530037b", "id": "9189ed1b0b1d42028bbff62da9d233e1"}], "name": "AIAA 42nd International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES) Conference", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "65143a613c8b45a4819a1c2ad530037b", "startDate": "2012-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130011628, "id": "17421887501b4342b5de6c4f652ea8ce", "publicationDate": "2012-07-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130011628.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130011628/downloads/20130011628.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130011628/downloads/20130011628.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130011628/downloads/20130011628.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
