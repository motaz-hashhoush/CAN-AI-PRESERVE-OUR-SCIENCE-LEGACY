Results indicated that for EVA rotation, the subjects' responses were of larger magnitude and less variable with EOD than with EC. However, for EHA rotation, responses were of larger magnitude and equally variable with EC as compared to EOD. Data also indicated that the quality of the EHA response with EC was altered because eyelid closure influenced the amount of periodic gaze. It is concluded that eyelid closure has an effect upon both canalocular and otolithocular reflexes and it is suggested that both EVA and EHA rotational testing be performed with EOD rather than with EC.", "title": "Eyes open versus eyes closed - Effect on human rotational responses", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T12:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900062015, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wall, Conrad, III"}, "organization": {"name": "Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary", "location": "Boston, United States"}}, "id": "90409b22692946efb16fba1c8be68588"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900062015, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Furman, Joseph M.
