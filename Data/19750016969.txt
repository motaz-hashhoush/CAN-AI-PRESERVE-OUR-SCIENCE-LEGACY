This\n\n3,883,812\ncharacteristic can be an important factor in many applications where sine waves are inconvenient and\nSquare waves, clock pulses or other vaveforms already\nexist.\nThe source impedance of the circuit was determined\nexperimentally at a frequency fe of 1.0 MHz (Ct = C2\n= 115 pF and Cr = 0.01 8 ^iF) and is given by the following approximation\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Xci is the reactance of C, or C2. This indicates\nthat high values will occur at low values of excitation\nfrequency /,,, and thereby set a limit either to the load\nor to the lowest value of fe practical for a particular\nload.\nThe response time of the circuit is limited by the\ncombination of the source impedance and the coupling\ncapacitors. The response to a step change in capacitance for no load is given by the following equation\ns\'-)\n\n(8)\nwhere C = Vi(Cr + \xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9e,\xe2\x80\x9e,,) and Z, is given by Eq. (7).\nEquation (8) indicates that for fast time response C r\nmust be kept small and yet large enough that C r \xc2\xbb C 2\nto prevent a reduction in sensitivity.\nFurthermore, by considering the transducer element\nand the diode-quad as the signal source with a source\nimpedance, Z s , it was experimentally verified that the\nsignal cutoff frequency, /\xe2\x80\x9e.\xe2\x80\x9e, for the differential output\nis given by\nfsco = (C2/Cc)ff\n\n(9)\nFor the single-ended output where the junction of the\ncoupling capacitor and the diode-quad is grounded\nthrough a high-O RF choke, the cutoff frequency is\none-half of that for the differential circuit. The reason\nthat the RF choke and excitation source combine to\nshort out the lower coupling capacitor to the signal\nsource. In the case of the differential output both coupling capacitors are essentially in series across the signal source. Thus, for the single-ended circuit there will\nbe a factor of 2 increase in the capacitive load to the\nsignal source and the cutoff frequency will decrease accordingly. Various single-ended embodiments are\nshown in the above referenced co-pending application.\nWhere the two impedance elements Z, and Z 2 in the\nbridge are both capacitors (or inductors), a change in\nthe input frequency will cause equal reactance changes\nin the capacitors and the bridge will remain balanced.\nThus, the circuit will not act as a discriminator when\nboth bridge elements are capacitors or inductors (or\nresistors). In order to use the circuit as a discriminator,\nimpedance elements are needed that will be "frequency selective" when the input frequency (frequency of generator 20) is altered.\nReferring now to FIGS. 3-7, for simplicity a plurality\nof alternative impedance sub-circuits are shown each\nof which include various combinations of impedance\nelements Z,\' and Z2\' that can be substituted for the capacitive impedance elements shown in FIG. 1 to provide diode-quad bridge circuits suitable for use as fre-\n\nquency discriminators. For clarity, the three circuit\nconnection points are designated 14\', 18\' and 26\' to\nindicate correspondence with the link numbered circuit points in FIG. 1.\nIn the impedance sub-circuit of FIG. 3 the impedance\nelement Z/ is comprised of an inductor LI and the impedance element Z2\' is comprised of a capacitor C2. By\nsubstituting this impedance sub-circuit for the Zi-Z2\nsub-circuit of FIG. 1, the circuit may be used as a sin10 gle-tuned L-C discriminator.\nIn the impedance sub-circuit of FIG. 4 the impedance\nelement Z/ is comprised of a resistor Rt and the impedance element Z2\' is comprised of an inductor L2. By\nsubstituting this impedance sub-circuit for the Z,-Z2\n15 sub-circuit of FIG. 1 the circuit may be used as an R-L\ndiscriminator.\nIn the impedance sub-circuit of FIG. 5 the impedance\nelement Z,\' is comprised of a resistor RI and the impedance element Z2\' is comprised of a capacitor C2. By\n20 substituting this impedance sub-circuit for the Zi-Z 2\nsub circuit of FIG. 1, the circuit may be used as an R-C\ndiscriminator.\nThe impedance element Z,\' in the sub-circuit of FIG.\n6 includes a series connected inductor L, and capacitor\n25\nCi, and the impedance element Z2\' includes a series\nconnected inductor L 2 and capacitor C 2 . With this subcircuit substituted into the circuit of FIG. 1, the circuit\nmay be used as a double-tuned series frequency discriminator.\n30 The impedance element Z,\' of the sub-circuit of FIG.\n7 includes a parallel connected inductor L t and capacitor C,, and the impedance element Z 2 \' includes a parallel connected inductor L 2 and capacitor C 2 . With this\nsub-circuit substituted into the circuit of FIG. I, the cir35 cuit may be used as a double-tuned parallel frequency\ndiscriminator.\nCircuits modified to include the sub-circuits of FIGS.\n3-7 produce an output voltage which varies substantially linearly with changes of input frequency about a\n40 center frequency and over a particular range of frequencies. The slope characteristic or sensitivity for\nboth the double-tuned series and parallel circuits is\ncontrollable by varying either the tuned circuit Q\'s of\nthe separation of the resonant frequencies of the two\n45 tuned circuits.\nAn interesting property of the diode-quad discriminator characteristics is that, in general, for input frequencies that are in either saturation region, the output\nvoltage remains at that saturated level until the fre50\nquency is brought back into the unsaturated region. By\nobserving the polarity of the DC output, it can be immediately determined whether the incoming frequency\nis above or below the center frequency of the discriminator.\n55\nThe circuit is also capable of measuring differences\nin resistances to provide a universal impedance bridge.\nThat is, by adjusting the input frequency, the unknown\nimpedance, one of the impedance elements Z, or Z2,\ncan be brought into balance with a known resistance\n60\nforming the other impedance element. An alternative\nmethod would be to hold the frequency constant and\nvary the resistance to bring about a balance condition\nwith the unknown. The accuracy in determining the absolute value of capacitance or inductance decreases as\nthe losses become more significant. This effect is produced by switching sequence of the diodes. This sequence prevents interaction of the two branches which\n\n3,883,812\n8\nmeans that the charge removal on the coupling capacitor will be related to only the magnitude of the impedance and not its phase. Thus, a variable resistance in\none half of the bridge can balance out the magnitude\nof an impedance in the other half of the bridge,\nwhether it consists of R, L, C, or any combination\nthereof.\nBy observing the direction of the output voltage as\nthe frequency is changed, it can be determined whether\nthe unknown is capacitive or inductive. Furthermore,\na measure of the slope of the output (Av/A/) provides\nan indirect measurement of the losses in the unknown\nbranch. It should be understood that small losses\n(R*\xc2\xabX*L) will not produce a noticeable change in the\nslops. However, taking this limitation into consideration, the information that can be determined from the\ncircuit measurements include the Q, the type of reactance, and the magnitude of the impedance which is\nsufficient information for universal impedance measurements.\nIn the basic circuit shown in FIG. 1 at least three\nleads are reuired to energize the circuit and obtain an\noutput signal therefrom. However, in FIGS. 8 and 9\nmodifications of the basic circuit are illustrated which\nare arranged so that a single co-axial cable may be used\nto both excite the transducer circuit and extract an output signal therefrom. In the embodiment shown in FIG.\n8, a first sub-circuit is provided at the remote end of\ncable 40 including a circulating diode bridge 42, a coupling capacitor Cr, a resistor 45, and a differential capacitor 44. At the other end of cable 40 a second subcircuit is provided including a signal source 46, a coupling capacitor Cr, a resistor 47, a capacitor C, and an\noutput terminal 48.\nMore specifically, the bridge terminal 50 is connected to one end of the inner conductor 52 of cable\n40 while bridge terminal 54 is coupled through the resistor 45 to the outer conductor 56 of cable 40. The\nouter plates 58 and 60 of differential capacitor 44 are\nconnected to the bridge terminals 62 and 64 respectively, while the inner plate 66 is coupled to outer conductor 56. The capacitance between plate 58 and plate\n66 develops a capacitance C t , while the capacitance\nbetween plates 60 and 66 develops a capacitance C2.\nThe coupling capacitor C,. is connected between bridge\nterminals 50 and 54.\nAt the other end of cable 40, the coupling capacitor\nC(. and signal source 46 form a series circuit between\nthe other end of inner conductor 52 and the outer conductor 56 (circuit ground). Output terminal 48 is coupled to inner conductor 52 through the resistor 47 and\nis coupled to outer conductor 56 by capacitor C.\nIn operation, the circuit of FIG. 8 operates identically\nin theory and practice to that explained above with reference to the FIG. 1 embodiment where a single ended\noutput circuit is connected across terminals 30 and 32.\nAlthough in the FIG. 1 embodiment, the excitation\nvoltage is coupled to the diode-quad through both of\nthe coupling capacitors C,., the performance of the circuit is unaffected if one of the coupling capacitors Cr\nis connected across the terminals 12 and 16 (in FIG. 8,\nterminals 50 and 54) instead of 24 and 16 since Cr continues to function as a means for coupling the excitation voltage to the lower terminal of the diode-quad.\nIn the alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 9, a first\nsub-circuit is provided at the remote end of cable 70\nincluding a circulating diode bridge 72, a coupling ca-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n6Q\n\n,,,\n\npacitor Cc, a resistor 75, and a variable differential inductor 74 comprised of windings LI and L2 and a moveable iron core. At the other end of cable 70 a second\nsub-circuit is provided including a signal source 76, a\ncoupling capacitor C0 a resistor 77, a capacitor C, and\nan output terminal 78.\nThe bridge terminal 80 is connected to one end of the\ninner conductor 82 of cable 70 while bridge terminal\n84 is coupled through the resistor 75 to the outer conductor 86 of cable 70. The opposite ends 88 and 90 of\nthe windings of differential inductor 74 are connected\nto the bridge terminals 92 and 94 respectively, while\nthe commonly connected ends 96 and 97 are connected to outer conductor 86 of cable 70. In the preferred embodiment the differential inductor 74 is a variable-differential-transformer (LVDT) type displacement transducer. The application of the LVDT to the\ncircuit is accomplished by connecting the two secondary windings in the circuit as illustrated to function as\ntwo differential inductors L, and L 2 . The coupling capacitor Cc is connected between bridge terminals 80\nand 84.\nAt the other end of cable 70 the coupling capacitor\nCr and signal source 76 form a series circuit between\nthe other end of inner conductor 82 and the outer conductor 86 (circuit ground). Output terminal 78 is coupled to inner conductor 82 through the resistor 77 and\nis coupled to outer conductor 86 by capacitor C.\nIn operation, the circuit of FIG. 9 operates similar in\ntheory and practice to that of FIG. 8.\nAmong the advantages of the present invention over\nthe prior art are that the circuit output is independent\nof frequency; the circuit output is independent of waveform so long as symmetry exists; no purely resistive elements are needed in the capacitive transducer circuits;\ncircuits provided in accordance with the present invention are up to twice as sensitive as prior art circuits; the\nlow source impedance produces extremely low noise\noutputs of less than 2 microvolts peak-to-peak; and the\ncircuits can be used for either R, L, or C type transducer, or for frequency discriminator applications with\nlittle, if any, modification.\nAlthough the above discription has been directed to\nseveral preferred embodiments which are shown in\nsimplified form, it is contemplated that many modifications will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in\nthe art after having read this disclosure.
