The two Voyager spacecraft each have 20-watt X-band transmitters; and at their Saturn encounter distances from Earth of approximately 1.5 billion kilometers, the power density received on the Earth was less than 10 to the minus 19th power watts per square meters. The thrust in deep-space communications improvement was in the areas of ground and spacecraft antenna size and performance increases, spacecraft transmitter power increase, ground receiving system design, and telemetry information coding. Ground antenna theory, design, and performance as related to the particular problem of receiving spacecraft signals using the Deep Space Network (DSN) is described.", "title": "Antennas", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T14:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830028033, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Slobin, S.
