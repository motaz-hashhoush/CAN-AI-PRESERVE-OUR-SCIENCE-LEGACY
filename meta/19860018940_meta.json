Studies of the vertical, zonal, and meridional neutral winds and temperature, whose extensive variations suggest the importance of energy transfer mechanism in modifying the structural properties of the region are reviewed. Layers below the F region of high plasma density that propagate to lower altitudes with drift velocities will be studied for their electron and ion composition and motion. These are to be measured by the TSS in conjunction with ground based radar observations. Basic fluid dynamics problems will be studied onboard tethered satellites. Studies will be conducted on the structure of the equatorial electrojet, in particular its longitudinal and meridional extent. Magnetic measurements will also be used to probe the tether current distribution in the plasma sheath.", "title": "Science applications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T18:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860018940, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mariani, F."}, "organization": {"name": "Rome Univ.", "location": "Rome, Italy"}}, "id": "23cabd0f227a420dbda2baeb48d8ac59"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19860018940, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860018940, "id": "4634be077dd04125b4d6652354a185dc", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington Applications of Tethers in Space: Workshop Proceedings, Volume 1", "publicationDate": "1986-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19860018935, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Applications of Tethers in Space: Workshop Proceedings, Volume 1", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19860018940.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19860018940/downloads/19860018940.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19860018940/downloads/19860018940.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19860018940/downloads/19860018940.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
