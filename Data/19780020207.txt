Sumner\n\nLewis Research Center\n\nSUMMARY\nAn experimental investigation was conducted to determine (1) the ground-hold and\nspace-hold thermal performance of a multilayer insulation (MLI) system mounted on a\nspherical, liquid-hydrogen propellant tank and (2) the degradation to the space-hold\nthermal performance of the MLI system that occurred a s a result of both thermal cycling and moisture introduced into the insulation panels. The propellant tank had a 1.39meter (4.57-ft) diameter. The M U consisted of two blankets of insulation; each blanket\ncontained 15 double-aluminized Mylar radiation shields alternated with 16 double silk\nnet spacers. A laminated aluminized Mylar and Dacron scrim cover sheet was applied\nto each side of each blanket.\nNineteen tests simulating basic cryogenic spacecraft thermal (environmental) conditions were conducted. Each thermal cycle typically included a gaseous-helium\npurge of the MLI, a liquid-hydrogen fill and ground-hold condition, a vacuum chamber\npumpdown and a vacuum space-hold condition, and a repressurization of the vacuum\nchamber and insulation system back to a l-atmosphere pressure. Prior to each of the\nlast seven thermal cycle tests, water vapor was introduced into the vacuum chamber\nfor varying periods of time to establish the resulting effect on the MLI space-hold thermal performance.\nInitial baseline space-hold and ground-hold heat inputs of 7.18 and 3845 watts\n(24.5 and 13 130 Btu/hr), respectively, were measured. There was no significant\nthermal degradation of the MLI system due to purging, pumpdown, or repressurization, and thermal cycling was noted. A significant difference in the MLI temperature\nhistory during the transition from ground-hold to space-hold conditions due to the presence of water vapor within the MLI system was noted. After the MLI had been subjected to moisture, the space-hold heat input increased to as much as 8.91 watts (30.4\nBtu/hr, a 19-percent increase over the nominal thermal performance. Increasing the\n2\'\ngaseous-helium purge temperature from 300 to 344 K (540\' to 60 R) was not effective\nin completely removing the moisture from within the MLI panels. The final measured\nspace-hold thermal performance, after attempting to remove the moisture by vacuum\npumping, was 8.04 watts (27.5 Btu/hr) Posttest inspections revealed no structural\ndamage to the insulation and no degradation of the emissivity of the radiation shields.\n\n.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWithin\'the last several years, the concept of a reusable cryogenic upper stage vehicle to be used to deliver and/or retrieve spacecraft from geosynchronous orbit has\nbeen proposed as a part of the Space Shuttle transportation system. Such an upper stage\nvehicle requires multilayer insulation (MLI) to provide the necessary space-hold (vacuum) thermal protection for the cryogenic propellants carried on the vehicle, particularly for near-Earth orbital operations of a few days or longer. To be cost effective,\nthe MLI on the propellant tanks must itself be reusable (e.g., ref. 1). This requires\nthat the heat input through the MLI must be predictable and must remain relatively constant from one space flight to the next during the required life expectancy of the insulation system. To enable the MLI to provide reliable thermal performance, the insulation system must be designed to meet all the environmental conditions imposed by such\na series of space flights. These environmental conditions include (1)purging the MLI\nto remove condensible gases both prior to and during the filling of the propellant tank\nwith a cryogen, (2) 1-atmosphere pressure ground-hold conditions (including continued\npurging of the MLI), (3) venting the MLI during atmospheric ascent, (4) vacuum spacehold conditions, and (5) purging and repressurizing the MLI during the atmospheric reentry with the vehicle in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle Orbiter.\nThe analytical and experimental test results of one potentially reusable MLI system\nwere reported in reference 2. This MLI system used double-goldized Kapton (DGK) radiation shields separated by Dacron tufts. The MLI system was enclosed in a purge bag\nsurrounding the propellant tank. Purging and repressurizing the MLI system was accomplished by flowing gaseous helium through purge pins penetrating the MLI and then\ndirectly between the individual radiation shields. The MLI system was subjected to\n100 thermal-environmental cycles representative of typical cryogenic spacecraft flight\nconditions. Space-hold thermal performance data for the MLI system were obtained\nperiodically during the test program. The total measured heat input was observed to\ndegrade up to 23 percent during the test program with most of the degradation attributed\nto the separation of three seams between adjacent MLI gore panels caused by the structural failure of several plastic links joining the panels.\nA second potentially reusable MLI system (ref. 3) was also designed, fabricated, and\ntested for space-hold thermal performance. This MLI system used double-aluminized\nMylar (DAM) radiation shields separated by double silk net spacers. A purge bag was\nnot incorporated as a part of the design of this MLI system. The proposed purge technique relied on introducing the helium purge gas under the MLI blankets as well as into\nthe volume surrounding the insulated tank. The purge gas would then be expected to diffuse into the insulation panels between individual radiation shields to displace the condensible gas therein initially. However, no experimental evaluation of the proposed\n2\n\npurge technique was conducted, and only space-hold thermal performance test results\nfor this particular MLI system were reported in reference 3.\nIt was of interest, therefore, to conduct additional experimental tests with a DAM/\nsilk net MLI system to further explore its potential for being classified as a reusable\ninsulation system. This type of insulation system, compared to the DGK/Dacron tuft\nMLI system reported in reference 2, could potentially provide the following advantages:\n(1)lower cost, (2) ability to fabricate MLI panels conforming to a double-curved tank\ncontour while maintaining good control of the layer density, (3) greater ease of replacement of damaged MLI panels, and (4) lower weight due to the elimination of the fiberglass girth fairing and purge bag. In regard to the last point, it was assumed that the\nstructural shell of the space vehicle (including propulsion vehicles as well as resupply\nvehicles carrying cryogenic fluids) could also act as the "purge bag.\nIn order to conduct the desired additional experimental tests, a 1.39-meter(4.57-ft-) diameter spherical cryogenic propellant tank was insulated with a DAM/silk\nnet MLI system in a manner very similar to that described in reference 3. The experimental test program was conducted in two parts: Part 1 (reported in ref. 4) was conducted to determine the purge characteristics of the MLI system; Part 2, reported\nherein, documents the resultsbof experimental tests in which the insulation system was\nsubjected to 19 thermal (environmental) cycles simulating the space vehicle flight conditions noted previously.\nDuring each of these 19 thermal (environmental) cycles, the MLI system was subjected to a gaseous-helium purge a t either 300 o r 344 K (540\' or 620\xc2\xb0 R) to displace the\ngaseous nitrogen and/or water vapor initially contained in the MLI system. Purging the\nMLI system was generally conducted for 3 hours. The measured purge gas concentrations within the MLI system at the end of the purge period were greater than 99 percent\nhelium (less than 1percent condensible gas remaining). One-atmosphere pressure\nground-hold and vacuum space-hold thermal performance measurements were obtained\nfor each thermal cycle with the propellant tank containing liquid hydrogen. W a t e r vapor\nwas added to the gaseous nitrogen (or, for two tests, helium) initially in the vacuum\nchamber and MLI system for the last seven thermal cycles to determine (1)the ability\nto purge moisture from within the M U system and (2) the subsequent degradation of the\nMLI space-hold thermal performance.\nAlthough test measurements were made primarily in the U. S. Customary Units\nsystem, the International System (SI) of Units is the primary system of units used in\nthis report.\n\n3\n\nSYMBOLS\nA\n\narea, m2 (ft2)\n\nd\n\'\n\ndischarge coefficient\n\nc1,2,3,4\n\nD~~\nd\nd0\nh\n\nconstants\ndiffusion coefficient, m2/min (ft2/min)\ndifferential\norifice diameter, cm 2 (in. 2)\nenthalpy, W-hr/kg (Btu/lb)\n\nI\nP\n\nMLI interstitial pressure, N/m 2 (torr)\n\nK\n\nthermal conductivity, W/m-K (Btu/hr-ft-\'R)\n\nLD\n\nlayer density, layers/cm (layers/in.)\n\nQ\n\nlength, m (ft)\n\nm\n\npurge gas mass flow rate, kg/hr (lbm/hr)\n\nN\n\nnumber of effective radiation shields\n\nn\n\nP\n\nnumber of MLI gore panels per blanket\npressure, N/m2 (lb/in. 2)\n\nQ\n\nheat input, W (Btu/hr)\nseam heat input, W/m (Btu/hr-ft)\nheat flux, W/m2 (Btu/hr-ft2)\n\nR\n\ngas constant, J/kg-K (ft-lbf/lbm-\'R)\n\nr\n\nradius, m (ft)\n\nT\n\ntemperature, K\n\nV\n\nvolume, m3 (e3)\n\nV\n\npurge gas volumetric flow rate, m3/hr (ft3/hr)\n\n*\nW\n\nmeasured liquid hydrogen boiloff mass flow rate, kg/hr (lbm/hr)\n\nX\n\nheight MLI gore panel extends on conical section, m (ft)\n\nf\n\nemissivity\n\n9\n\nhalf-angle, deg\n\nA\n\nlatent heat of vaporization, W-hr/kg (Btu/lbm)\n\n4\nd\n\n(OR)\n\nP\n\nP\n\ndensity, kg/m3 (lbm/ft3)\nreflectance\n\nSubscripts :\n\na\n\napex of truncated cone\n\nC\n\ncold\n\n60\n\nconical MLI panel\n\ncond\n\nconduction\n\ng\n\nMLI gore panel\n\nh\n\nhot\n\nh\n\nhemi spherical\n\nL\n\nliquid\n\nMLI\n\nmultilayer insulation\n\n-\n\nn\n\nnear normal\n\nsv\n\nsaturated vapor\n\nS\n\nseam\n\nTV\n\ntank vent\n\ntot\n\ntotal\nEXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS\n\nThe experimental test apparatus was designed to use the measurement of the liquid\nhydrogen boiloff flow rate as an indication of the total heat input into the test tank. This\ntechnique of colorimetry required taking several precautions to accurately determine\nthe relatively low heat input into the test tank attributed to the multilayer insulation\nduring the space-hold (vacuum) tests. These precautions included the following:\n(1) Thermally shorting the plumbing lines and instrumentation wires associated\nwith the test tank to a cold guard filled with liquid hydrogen to minimize the\nextraneous heat leaks into the test tank\n(2) Maintaining the pressure and temperature of the liquid hydrogen in the cold\nguard slightly higher than that in the test tank to prevent condensation of the\nboiloff gas flow from the test tank\n(3) Maintaining the test tank pressure at very nearly a constant value to reduce variations in the boiloff gas flow rate due to the heat storage capacity of the liquid\nhydrogen\n5\nd\n\n(4)Measuring the boiloff gas temperature just prior to being vented from the test\ntank to account for heating the boiloff gas to some higher outlet temperature\n(5) Maintaining a constant temperature environment (or shroud) surrounding the insulated test tank so that the measured heat inputs were directly comparable\nfrom one test to the next\n\nTest Tank\nThe liquid hydrogen test tank (fig. 1) used in this test program was a spherical tank\n3\n1.39 meters (4.57 ft) in diameter that had a volume of 1.42 cubic meters (50 f t ). The\ntank was constructed of 2219-T62 aluminum. The upper and lower hemispherical shells\nof the tank were chemically milled to a membrane thickness of 0 . 0 9 4 N . 013 centimeter\n(0.037M.005 in.); the weld lands were 0.41 centimeter (0.16 in. ) thick. The test tank\nhad a working pressure of 3 . 4 ~ 1 5 newtons per square meter differential (50 psid) The\n0\ntank was supported by three support brackets welded to the lower hemispherical shell.\nThe test tank incorporated a 0.3-meter- (l-ft-) diameter access opening and cover\nto allow access to the tank interior. The access cover had four ports to accommodate a\nvent line, a dip-tube f i l l and drain line, an instrumentation rake, and an electrical feedthrough. A conical deflector was mounted on the access cover just under the entrance\nto the vent line inside the test tank. The purpose of this deflector was to minimize the\nentrainment of liquid hydrogen droplets in the boiloff gas flow venting from the tank during the high-heat-flux, ground-hold boiloff conditions. An instrumentation rake containing six platinum resistance thermometers (PRT\'s) to measure liquid hydrogen and ullage\ngas temperatures was also mounted on the access cover inside the test tank.\n\n.\n\nMultilayer Insulation System (MLI)\nThe MLI system installed on the liquid hydrogen test tank employed the same basic\nmodular design as the MLI system previously tested for space-hold (vacuum) thermal\nperformance and reported in reference 3. The basic insulation design concept used two\nMLI blankets (fig. 2) to cover and thermally protect the entire tank surface. Each blanket consisted of 15 DAM radiation shields alternately spaced with 16 double silk net spacers. A laminated, aluminized Mylar/Dacron scrim (reinforced Mylar) cover sheet was\napplied to each side of each blanket. The layup of cover sheets, radiation shields, and\nsilk net spacers for eachMLIblanket was held together by Nylon button-pin studs spaced\non approximately 20-centimeter (8-in. ) centers\nThe portion of the MLI blankets installed on the sides of the test tank were fabricated in the shape of gore panels with each blanket of MLI containing six 60\xc2\xb0 gore panels\n\n.\n\n6\nd\n\n(fig. 3(a)). The panels were fabricated to conform to the nominal double-curved contour\nof the tank wall by using the following techniques:\n(1)Forming the silk net spacers to the desired contour by wetting, stretching, and\ndrying the silk netting on a male mold\n(2) Partially forming the radiation shields by means of vacuum forming in a female\nmold and then completing the forming to the desired contour by cutting, folding, and taping the aluminized Mylar on a male mold\n(3) Partially forming the cover sheets by vacuum forming in a female mold and then\ncompleting the forming to the desired contour by hand ironing the sheets over a\nmale mold\nThe room temperature emissivity of several of the radiation shields was measured\nafter forming the shields to the desired tank contour. The room temperature emissivity\n- of the radiation shields was the average value of total hemispherical emittance\nE\ntot, h\nas determined by a Gier Dunkle reflectometer (model DB 100). The reflectometer provided a measurement of the near-normal reflectance p- of the surface of a sample.\nn\nof the radiation shields was then calculated\nThe total hemispherical emittance E\ntot,K\nfrom the following equation as suggested by reference 5:\nE\n\ntot, h\n\n= 1.33 E , = 1.33\n\nn\n\nThe total hemispherical emittance, as determined by averaging a total of 125 measurements on five different radiation shields, was 0.050.\nMLI panels in the shape of truncated cones w e r e used to thermally protect the top\nand bottom of the test tank. These panels were fabricated in a manner very similar to\nthe 60\' gore panels with the exception that partial vacuum forming the radiation shields\nand cover sheets was not required. Both the radiation shields and cover sheets were\nformed to the desired conical countour by simply cutting, folding, and taping flat sheets\nof the material over a male mold.\nDuring the assembly of the MLI panels, the Nylon button-pin studs were cemented\nto the exterior surface of the cover sheets at their points of contact to further provide a\npositive means of layer density control. The nominal insulation panel layer density was\napproximately 18 layers per centimeter (45 layers per inch). This value was based on\nthe Nylon button-pin stud length of 0.95 centimeter (0.38 in. ); the effective thickness of\neach of the cover sheets of approximately 0.025 centimeter (0.010 in.) was also accounted for.\nAlso added to the MLI 60\' gore panels during assembly were the items necessary\nto provide installation for the panels on the test tank. These items included strips of\n\n7\n\nd\n\nVelcro hook and pile fastener and Nylon grommets. The location of the polyester Velcro fastener on the MLI gore panels is shown in figure 3 . Short intermittent strips of\nVelcro pile 5.1 centimeters (2.0 in.) wide were adhesively bonded to the outer cover\nsheets adjacent to one edge of the panels for both the inner and outer blankets of insulation. Long continuous strips of Velcro hook 2.5 centimeters (1.0 in.) wide were adhesively bonded to the inward (toward the tank wall) facing portions of both the inner and\nouter cover sheets which extended beyond the edge of the NIL1 panels along each side as\nnoted in figure 3@).\nSix Nylon grommets were also installed in each NIL1 gore panel (two near the top,\ntwo at the equator, and two near the bottom) as indicated in figure 4 The grommets\n.\ncompletely penetrated the insulation panels and were retained in place by means of snapon washers.\nDuring assembly of the conical MLI panels for the top and bottom of the test tank,\nshort strips of 2.5-centimeter- (1 0-in. -) wide Velcro fastener were adhesively bonded\nto the inner and outer cover sheets of the inner panels and the inner cover sheet of the\nouter panels. The general location of the Velcro fastener for the MLI panels at the bottom of the test tank (for example) is shown in figure 5. No Nylon grommets were installed in these conical MLI panels.\n\nInstallation of MLI Panels on Test Tank\nPrior to installing the MLI panels, the following items (shown in fig. 6) were installed on the test tank: (1)vent and f i l l line tube connections, (2) two MLI gore panel\npurge rings, (3) two fiberglass cones, (4) two fiberglass cone purge tubes, (5) Velcro\npile fastener, and (6) 36 Nylon positioning pins. The two circumferential purge rings\nwere fabricated from 0.64-centimeter- (0.25-in. -) diameter aluminum tubing. Each\npurge ring contained 24 pairs of holes 0 . 0 3 3 centimeter (0.013 in.) in diameter equally\nspaced around the circumference of the tank. The holes in each pair were located on\nopposite sides (top and bottom) of the purge ring to more evenly distribute the helium\npurge gas underneath the MLI gore panels. The upper and lower fiberglass cones were\nused to support the conical MLI panels at the top and bottom of the tank. These cones\nwere perforated with 0.32-centimeter- (0.125-in. -) diameter holes spaced on\n2.0-centimeter (0.80-in.) centers to allow passage of the helium purge gas. The two\n0.64-centimeter- (0.25-in. -) diameter cone purge tubes distributed helium purge gas\nunder the fiberglass cones and conical MLI panels at the top and bottom of the tank.\nThe short, intermittent strips of 5.1-centimeter- (2.0-in. -) wide Velcro pile fastener\nadhesively bonded to the tank wall were one means of attaching the MLI gore panels to\nthe sides of the test tank. The 36 Nylon positioning pins were used to properly locate\n\n8\n\nthe MLI gore panels on the test tank. The positioning pins also acted as a second means\nof attaching the gore panels to the tank. The base of each Nylon pin was adhesively\nbonded to the tank wall with a fiberglass cloth overlay and a thermoplastic polyester\nresin adhesive (Pliobond 4001/4004). The detail of the Nylon positioning pins, as well\nas the Nylon grommets mentioned previously, is noted in references 3 and 4.\nThe normal tank f i l l and drain elbow at the bottom of the tank (fig. 6) was blanked\noff and not used for this test program. Not shown in figure 6 are the strips of Velcro\npile fastener adhesively bonded to the fiberglass cones to mate with the Velcro hook\nfastener on the inner cover sheets of the inner blanket conical MLI panels required for\nsupport of these panels.\nThe completed installation of the NIL1 system on the test tank is shown in figure 7 .\nThe installation of this system was also very similar to that described in reference 3.\nThe inner blanket gore panels were installed a s fabricated. The outer blanket gore\npanels, prior to installation, were cut back on the top and bottom (as shown in figs. 7\nand 8) to mate with the outer blanket conical MLI panels in a standard butt joint. The\ninner cover sheets of the outer blanket gore panels, however, were left full length to\nfit over the Nylon positioning pins located near the top and bottom of the tank. The vertical butt joints between the MLI gore panels for the inner and outer blankets of insula\'\ntion were offset 6 as shown in figure 9 s o that there would not be a direct path for thermal radiation to reach the tank wall. The overlapping cover sheets at each butt joint\nalso provided additional protection from thermal radiation. Cutouts were made in all\nMLI gore panels to accommodate the penetration of the tank support brackets as shown\nin figure 10,\nThe conical MLI panels for the inner blanket of insulation were then installed on\nthe top and bottom of the tank. The edges of these conical MLI panels were attached\nintermittently to the inner cover sheet of the MLI gore panels in the outer blanket with\nVelcro fasteners in a Y-type joint as shown in figure 8. The conical MLI panels in the\nouter blanket were then installed and mated with the MLI gore panels in the outer blanket with a standard butt joint with overlapping cover sheets.\nSmall, five-layer MLI panels (positioning pin covers) were installed over the protruding Nylon positioning pins and tank support brackets near the tank equator (figs. 7,\n9, and 11) to prevent thermal radiation from reaching the tank directly. The positioning pin covers consisted of five radiation shields and six double silk net spacers with a\nreinforced Mylar cover sheet on each side. The positioning pin covers were held together with Dacron thread stitched around the outside edges. The covers were attached\nto the MLI gore panels of the outer blanket by means of Velcro fasteners and aluminized\nMylar tape.\nAfter the insulation system was installed on the test tank, the emissivity of several\nradiation shields at locations near the edge of the MLI gore panels was again measured\n9\n\nwith a Gier Dunkle reflectometer. Despite the fact that nearly five years had passed\nsince the original date of manufacture of the MLI gore panels, the average total hemi- of the 1 2 locations measured was 0.040. This value was\nspherical emissivity E\ntot, h\nsomewhat less than the value of 0.050 noted previously because the earlier value included measurements near the center of the radiation shields where the emissivity had\nbeen degraded slightly due to the partial vacuum forming of the shields.\nThe weights of the various components of the MLI system a r e noted in table I. The\nweight of the ideal MLI panel of 0.511 kilogram per square meter (0.105 lb/ft2) is for\na flat panel made without resorting to vacuum forming o r any cutting, folding, and\ntaping of the radiation shields. The weights of the MLI system panels installed on the\ntest tank were calculated by using these component weights. These calculated weights\na r e compared in table I1 with the actual weights of the MLI system panels determined\nonce the test program had been completed. Overall, the MLI system weight (excluding\nthe fiberglass cones) was approximately 1 0 percent greater than that calculated. Most\nof this difference is probably due to the fact that the calculated MLI panel weights do not\naccount for overlapping, folding, o r taping the individual radiation shields o r for such\nitems a s aluminized Mylar tape, adhesive, o r thread used i n fabricating the MLI panels.\n\nInstallation of Test Tank in Vacuum Chamber\n\nAll tests were conducted with the insulated test tank mounted within a cylindrical\nvacuum chamber 1.83 meters (6.00 ft) in diameter by 3.12 meters (10.25 ft) high.\nThree 0.25-meter (10-in. ) oil diffusion pumps provided a vacuum capability in the low\nnewton per square meter\ntorr) range at ambient temperature conditions and\nin the low loM4newton per square meter\ntorr) range with the test tank filled with\nliquid hydrogen.\nThe insulated test tank was suspended from a tubular, stainless-steel support ring\nby six stainless-steel wire support struts 0.24 centimeter (0.094 in.) in diameter and\n24.0 centimeters (9.46 in.) long (fig. 10). The tubular support ring was, in turn, suspended from the lid of the vacuum chamber by six support rods (fig. 12). The insulated\ntest tank was enclosed in an electrically heated cylindrical shroud. The temperature of\nthe shroud could be maintained within =kl.1 K (2.0\' R) of a desired temperature during\nthe helium purge tests and the space-hold thermal performance tests. The shroud consisted of five curved aluminum panels on the sides and two flat aluminum panels on the\ntop and bottom. The vertical joints between adjacent side panels and the horizontal\njoints between the semicircular top and bottom panels were (1) open to allow purge\ngases to flow in and out of the shroud and (2) optically dense (see fig. 12) so that no direct thermal radiation from the vacuum chamber wall could reach the outer surface of\n10\n\nd\n\nthe insulation system. The shroud was bolted to the tank support ring for support.\nA liquid hydrogen cold guard (0.76 m (2.5 ft) in diameter and 0.51 m (1.67 ft) high)\nwas located above the test tank as shown in figure 12. This cold guard was to minimize\nany extraneous heat leaks to the test tank during the space-hold thermal performance\ntests. All purge tubing and instrumentation wiring that led to instrumentation located\non o r within the test tank was thermally shorted directly to the wall of the cold guard.\nThe four purge tubes leading to the test tank were brazed to the wall of the cold guard\n(fig. 13(a)). The instrumentation wiring was adhesively bonded with the thermoplastic\npolyester resin adhesive mentioned earlier and clamped to the wall of the cold guard\n(fig. 13(b)). The test tank vent and f i l l lines passed directly through the cold guard and\nincorporated nearly right-angle bends to minimize extraneous heat leaks (including radiation tunneling) from this source. The cold guard was insulated with two blankets of\nMLI in very much the same manner as the test tank. The cold guard contained a sufficient volume of liquid hydrogen such that it did not require refilling during a 4%-day\nspace-hold thermal performance test. A photograph of the insulated test tank and cold\nguard is shown in figure 14.\nLead wires for the temperature sensors (thermocouples) located within the MLI\nsystem were thermally conditioned by running the lead wires along the reinforced Mylar\ncover sheets to which the sensors were attached all the way to the top of the test tank.\nThe lead wires were then run up the vent line and to the top of the cold guard before they\nwere brought out from within the insulation system. Lead wires to temperature sensors\nlocated on the outside surface of the MLI system were not thermally conditioned since\nthe outer surface temperature of the insulation was very close to the ambient shroud\ntemperature during the purge and space-hold thermal performance tests.\n\nPurge G a s System\nThe purposes of the purge gas system were to allow (1) purging the MLI on both the\ntest tank and cold guard with gaseous helium, (2) purging the vacuum chamber with\neither gaseous helium o r gaseous nitrogen, and (3) repressurizing both the MLI and\nvacuum chamber from vacuum conditions to a 1-atmosphere pressure with either gaseous helium or gaseous nitrogen. Helium purge gas was distributed to the two purge\ntubes and two purge rings located under the MLI on the test tank from a common MLI\npurge manifold. Four flow-control orifices downstream of the manifold were used to\ndistribute the purge gas in the volumetric flow rates desired to each purge tube and\npurge ring. The range of flow-control orifice diameters was such that the purge gas\nvolumetric flow rates to the four arbitrarily defined purge regions in the MLI system\n(shown in fig. 15) were relatively uniform on the basis of MLI system volumes per unit\ntime. The calculated volume of each purge region was the volume between the outer\n1\n1\n\nsurface of the insulation and the wall of the test tank. The volumetric flow through each\nchoked-flow flow-control orifice can be compared by looking at the relative values of\nthe orifice diameters, which ranged from 0.0292 to 0.0318 centimeter (0.0115 to\nn)\n0.0125 i . , and discharge coefficients, which ranged from 0.802 to 0.898.\nThe purge gas heater with a 300-watt (1020 Btu/hr) electric heating capability was\ninstalled between the cold guard and the test tank as shown in figure 13(a). This heater\nheated the helium purge gas for the MLI system on the test tank to 350 K (630\' R) for\nthose purge tests where this was desired.\nAdditional details of the purge gas system a r e given in reference 4.\n\nNIL1 Gas Sampling System\nThe purpose of the MLI gas sampling system was to provide a means of determining\nthe purge gas concentration within the MLI system during the purge tests. Twelve gas\nsampling tubes were provided to withdraw samples of purge gas from within the MLI\nsystem. Six tubes were used to obtain gas samples at the butt joints between adjacent\nMLI panels to determine the time-dependent boundary conditions a\xe2\x82\xac the edges of the\npanels. The other six tubes were used to obtain samples of purge gas from within NIL1\npanels between the radiation shields. The specific gas sampling locations a r e shown in\nfigure 16.\nThe gas sampling tubes were inserted laterally into the MLI system through the\nbutt joints. The six tubes used to obtain gas samples from within the MLI panels themselves were located between the two silk nets between the two outer radiation shields in\neach panel to minimize any degradation to the thermal performance of the insulation\nsystem. All.of the gas sampling tubes were fabricated from 0.102-centimeter\n(0.040-in.) outside diameter by 0.015-centimeter (0.006-in.) wall thickness stainlesssteel tubing to minimize any disturbance to the MLI panels a s well a s any extraneous\nheat leaks from the tubes themselves.\nThe gaseous-nitrogen concentration of the gas samples from the individual gas\nsampling tubes was sensed by two commercial thermal conductivity cells, one for the\ngas samples obtained at the butt joints and one for the gas samples obtained from within\nthe NIL1 panels. The gas sampling tubes were paired together for purposes of obtaining\nexperimental data such that the gas sample obtained from within a given MLI panel was\nanalyzed for gas concentration by one thermal conductivity cell at the same time a s the\ngas sample obtained from the adjacent butt joint was analyzed by the second thermal\nconductivity cell.\nAdditional details of the MLI gas sampling system a r e given in reference 4.\n\n12\nd\n\nInstrumentation\nTemperatures of the MLI blankets as well as of the constant-temperature shroud,\nthe warm ends of the tank support struts, the Nylon positioning pins, and the purge\ngases were measured with chromel-constantan thermocouples. The temperature profiles across the MLI system were measured at six locations: (1)one each on the upper\nand lower conical MLI panels, (2) one each on the lower half and at the equator of the\nMLI gore panels, and (3) two on the upper half of the MLI gore panels. At each location temperatures were measured for the inner and outer cover sheets of the inner and\nouter blankets of insulation. Two additional thermocouples were used to measure the\ntemperature on the inside surfaces (cover sheets) of two of the positioning pin covers,\none larger rectangular positioning pin cover and one smaller circular positioning pin\ncover. These thermocouples were fabricated from 0.020-centimeter- (0.008-in. -)\ndiameter wire. The thermocouple junctions were adhesively bonded to the reinforced\nMylar cover sheets of the MLI panels with double-stick Mylar tape for approximately\n2.5 centimeters (1.0 in.). The thermocouple junctions and approximately 15 centimeters (6 in.) of the lead wires were then covered and taped to the cover sheet with\naluminized Mylar tape. The thermocouple leads from the thermocouples located on the\ninner MLI blanket and the inner cover sheet of the outer blanket were further thermally\nconditioned by running the wires along the cover sheets to which the junctions were attached to the top of the test tank, along the vent line insulation, and around the cold\nguard up to the top. The leads were then withdrawn from the cold guard insulation and\nrouted to electrical feedthroughs in the lid of the vacuum chamber. The reference\njunctions for all the chromel-constantan thermocouples were immersed in a liquidnitrogen bath. The temperature measurements provided by these thermocouples had a\nprobable e r r o r of ~ 4 . 0 (k7.2\' R) at liquid hydrogen temperature. This e r r o r was a\nK\nminimum of a. K ( ~ 15 R) at approximately 140 K (252\' R) and then increased to\n83\nO\n.\nk2.3 K (~4.2\' R) at room temperature. Calculations of the probable e r r o r considered\ne r r o r s from such sources as sensor e r r o r s (e. g., span between measured and reference temperatures, inhomogeneity of wire, and variations in reference bath temperature) and digitizer e r r o r s (e.g., readout accuracy, resolution, and noise).\nAdditional temperaJure measurements were obtained in areas expected to be at o r\nnear liquid-hydrogen temperature using platinum resistance thermometers (PRT\'s) to\nimprove the accuracy of these measurements. Six PRT\'s w e r e mounted on an instrumentation rake within the test tank to measure liquid-hydrogen and ullage gas temperatures. These PRT\'s were located at ullage levels of 1.50, 5.19, 6.50, 7.95, 9.51,\nand 15.0 percent. Six PRT\'s were also located on the exterior surface of the test tank\nto measure tank wall temperatures. These PRT\'s were located on the access cover,\non the access cover support ring, and on the tank wall itself at ullage levels of 2.0,\n13\nd\n\n5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 percent. PRT\'s were also located on the cold ends of the tank support struts and on the tank vent and fill lines between the tank and cold guard. These\nPRT\'s as well as those on the exterior surface of the tank were adhesively bonded in\nplace using a thermoplastic polyester resin adhesive (Pliobond 400 1/4004). The copper\nlead wires for all these PRT\'s were thermally conditioned by adhesively bonding them\nto the wall of the cold guard (fig. 13(b)) before the leads were routed to the electrical\nfeedthroughs in the lid of the vacuum chamber. Two additional PRT probes were\nmounted in the cold guard to monitor the liquid-hydrogen level in the guard. All of\nthese temperature measurements had a probable e r r o r from &O. 07 to hl. 26 K (*. 12\'\nto 2.27\' R) at liquid-hydrogen temperature depending on the temperature range of the\nelectrical bridge circuit employed. These ranges varied from 20 to 26.7 K (36Oto 48\' R)\nto 20 to 111K (36\' to 200\' R). Calculations of the probable e r r o r considered e r r o r s\nfrom such sources as sensor e r r o r s (e. g. , calibration and repeatability specifications),\nlead wire and electrical connector e r r o r s (thermal EMF), and bridge unit e r r o r s (e. g. ,\naccuracy and nonlinearity) as well as the digitizer e r r o r s noted previously.\nThe liquid-hydrogen boiloff flaw rate under the relatively high-heat-flux groundhold conditions was measured using two-different devices. A venturi with a throat diameter of 1.765 centimeters (0.695 in. ) was used for the first seven ground-hold tests.\nBecause the measured ground-hold boiloff rate was less than originally predicted, a\nflat plate orifice with a diameter of 1.524 centimeters (0.600 in. ) was substituted for\nthe venturi to improve the accuracy of the measurements for the remainder of the tests.\nBoth flowmeters were calibrated prior to use. The venturi was designed to have a\n1.4x1O4 newtons per square meter differential pressure (2.0 psid) at the predicted flow\nrate while the flat-plate orifice provided a pressure differential of approximately\n1 . 0 ~ 1 4 newtons p e r square meter (1.5 psid) at the actual flow rates obtained.\n0\nThe liquid-hydrogen boiloff flow rate under the relatively low-heat-flux space-hold\nconditions was measured using a mass flowmeter having a 0 to 3.4 standard cubic meter\nper hour (0 to 2 standard f t 3/min) range. The uncertainty associated with this meter\nwas a. percent of full scale.\n5\nTwo thermal conductivity cells were used to determine the gaseous-nitrogen concentration within the MLI system during the purge tests. The drift of the zero and fullscale outputs of the cells noted during the steady-state calibrations and transient data\ntaking was minimized by zeroing and spanning the output of the cells frequently. In general, the e r r o r due to drift occurring during the purge tests was l e s s than 3-percentgaseous-nitrogen concentration when measuring nitrogen concentrations near 100 percent, and it was less than approximately 0.3-percent-nitrogen concentration when measuring nitrogen concentrations near 0 percent. The dynamic e r r o r was small compared\nto the anticipated e r r o r due to drift, and no corrections for instrument e r r o r due to dynamic response were applied to the experimental data. A time interval of approximately\n\n14\nd\n\neight time constants was allowed from the time the output of the thermal conductivity\ncells started to respond to a change in gaseous-nitrogen concentration when shifting\nfrom one gas sampling tube to the next until the time the final output reading was taken.\nTest tank, cold guard, and vacuum chamber pressures, as well as purge gas pressures upstream of the flow-control orifices and ground-hold boiloff gas pressures at\nthe flowmeters, were measured with bonded strain-gage transducers, which had an estimated uncertainty of ~ 0 . 2 5percent of full scale. Vacuum levels within the vacuum\nchamber were also measured by thermocouple gages and ionization gages. The ionization gages were located on the wall of the vacuum chamber as well as within the constant\ntemperature shroud.\n\nControl Systems\nThe temperature of the constant-temperature shroud enclosing the insulated test\ntank was controlled in a closed-loop mode by four separate alternating current electrical\nheating circuits having a total capacity of approximately 10 000 watts (34 000 Btu/hr).\nThe shroud was divided into four heating zones top, bottom, and upper and lower\nhalves of the cylindrical walls. The top and bottom zones each used two silicon rubber\nheating blankets wired in parallel. The upper and lower zones of the Cylindrical walls\neach had five heating blankets wired in parallel (one blanket on each of the five side\npanels). Temperature control of the shroud during the space-hold thermal performance\ntests was maintained at 3 0 0 ~ 1 (54OoA2O R).\nK\nTemperature control of the purge gas heater was also provided in a closed-loop\nmode by a 300-watt (1020-Btu/hr) silicon rubber heater and controller.\nRepressurization of the MLI system and vacuum chamber from vacuum conditions\nto a 1-atmosphere absolute pressure was accomplished by opening two flow-control\nvalves in the purge gas system on a preselected schedule. The valves were opened such\nthat (1)purge gas flow rates into the MLI system and vacuum chamber would be controlled in an attempt to provide a slight positive pressure within the MLI system and\n(2) the pressure rise rate in the vacuum chamber would approximate that expected in the\ncargo bay of the Space Shuttle Orbiter (ref. 7).\nThe test tank and cold guard pressures were maintained at a constant level during\nthe space-hold thermal performance tests by two separate closed-loop control systems\nas shown in, figure 17. These pressure-control systems used high resolution,\ndifferential-pressure, capacitance transducers which sensed very small pressure variations inside the test tank and cold guard relative to an absolute reference pressure.\nThe electrical output signals from the transducers were used as input signals to control\nunits for the motorized pressure-regulating valves in the test tank and cold guard vent\n\n-\n\n15\n\nlines. Opening and closing the motorized valves regulated the liquid-hydrogen boiloff\nflow rates to maintain the tank pressures at constant values. The reference pressure\nwas provided by a 0.0148-cubic-meter (0.523-ft 3) gaseous-nitrogen tank maintained at\na constant temperature by an ice bath. This system maintzined the test tank and cold\nguard pressures to within 5.5 newtons per square meter (0.0008 psi) of the reference\ntank pressure. This reduced the potential variations in the boiloff gas flow rate due to\nthe heat storage capacity of the liquid hydrogen so that e r r o r s in the total measured heat\ninput caused by fluctuations in tank pressure were less than approximately 0.5 percent\nof the measured value. The reference pressure varied from test to test depending on\nthe test tank pressure variations experienced when the tank was filled and subsequently\ntopped-off with liquid hydrogen. The reference tank pressure was always set lower than\nthe minimum test tank pressure experienced while loading liquid hydrogen; the pres5\n5\nsures used varied from 1.07~10 to 1.21~10 newtons per square meter (15.5 to 17.5\npsia). In addition, the cold guard pressure was maintained between 70 and 210 newtons\nper square meter (0.01 to 0.03 psia) above that of the test tank so that no condensation\nof the boiloff gas from the test tank would occur as the boiloff gas flowed through the\nportion of the vent line passing through the cold guard.\n\nData Recording\nMost of the experimental data were recorded by a high-speed digital data system.\nAdditionally, some of the data such a s the test tank, cold guard and vacuum chamber\npressures, liquid-hydrogen boiloff rate, shroud temperatures, output of the capacitancetype differential pressure transducers in the tank pressure control system, and the output of the thermal conductivity cells in the gas sampling system were recorded on strip\ncharts in the control room. A small amount of data was also recorded by hand from\ndigital panel meters located in the control room.\n\nTEST PROCEDURE\nPurge Test\nPrior to each gaseous helium purge test, the vacuum chamber was evacuated to a\nvacuum level of 10 newtons per square meter (0.08 torr) or less to purge the NIL1 system and vacuum chamber of any gases remaining from the previous test. The chamber\nwas then slowly backfilled with clean, dry gaseous nitrogen to 1 atmosphere absolute\npressure over a period of about 1 hour. For the series of tests concerned with the degradation of the MLI thermal performance due to the presence of moisture, the chamber\n16\n\nd\n\nwas initially blackfilled to slightly less than a 1-atmosphere absolute pressure. A sufficient quantity of distilled water was then added to the chamber, primarily through the\nchamber vent line, to create a 100-percent relative humidity environment within the\nchamber. The MLI system was exposed to this environment for periods ranging from\n2 hours to 56 days before continuing with the test.\nGas samples were then generally taken from within the MLI system to check the\ngas sampling system operation and confirm the presence of 100-percent nitrogen gas.\nThe purge system gas supply pressures were set to provide the desired purge gas flow\nrates, and the shroud heater and purge gas heater controllers were set at either 300 o r\n350 K (540\' o r 630\' R) depending on the test requirements. The 350 K (630\' R) shroud\ntemperature was required to obtain the desired 344 K (620\' R) temperature of the NIL1\nsystem during the time allotted for the purge test. At the start of the purge test, the\nheaters were turned on and the MLI system and vacuum chamber helium purge flows\nwere started simultaneously. The purge gases were vented near the bottom of the\nvacuum chamber. Gas samples from within the MLI system were withdrawn for 1 minute each through the 1 2 gas sampling tubes at fairly regular intervals during the purge\ntest. These intervals were, approximately, either or 1 hour. The purge tests were\ncontinued for 3 to 4 hours to insure that the gaseous-nitrogen concentrations a t all the\ngas sampling locations had been reduced to less than 1 percent.\n\n4\n\nGround-Hold Thermal Performance Test\nAfter the purge test had been completed, the purge gas heater was turned off, and\nthe shroud heater controllers were set at 300 K (540\' R). The gaseous helium purge\nflow rates for both the MLI system and the vacuum chamber were reduced to the desired values for the ground-hold tests. The test tank was then filled with liquid hydrogen over approximately hour. Once the tank was full, as indicated by the platinum\nresistance thermometers located inside the tank, a reduced flow of liquid hydrogen into\nthe tank was maintained until the PRT located on the access cover indicated that the\ncover had chilled down to near the liquid-hydrogen temperature. During this f i l l pro0\ncedure, the test tank pressure was maintained at approximately 1 . 4 ~ 1 5 newtons per\nsquare meter (20 psia) To measure the ground-hold liquid-hydrogen boiloff flow rate,\n0\nthe tank pressure was reduced and maintained at 1 . 2 4 ~ 1 5 newtons per square meter\n(18.0 psia). The 4-kilowatt (13 660-Btuhr) heater in the facility vent line (fig. 17)\nwas turned on to increase the boiloff gas temperature, and hence the-volumetric flow,\nthrough the measurement device to improve the accuracy. Approximately 10 minutes\nwere required for the tank pressure to stabilize, and another 10 to 20 minutes were\nrequired for the boiloff flow rate to reach a relatively constant value. The differential\n\n4\n\n.\n\n17\n\npressure was then measured across either the venturi or the flat-plate orifice flow\nmeasurement device. The liquid-hydrogen f i l l level in the test tank was generally\nbetween the 5 and 6.5 percent ullage levels when the boiloff flow rate measurement was\nmade.\n\nSpace-Hold Thermal Performance Test\nAfter the ground-hold thermal performance test had been completed, the vacuum\nchamber was evacuated to vacuum conditions at a rate as fast as the test facility pumping capability would allow. The oil diffusion pumps were cut in at a vacuum level of\napproximately 10 newtons per square meter (8X10-2 torr), and a vacuum level of approximately 0 . 1 newton per square meter (8X10-4 torr) could be reached within 1 2 to 15\nminutes after the start of the pumpdown. Times as long as 20 to 30 minutes were required to reach this vacuum level because of increased outgassing if the MLI system\nhad been exposed to water vapor. The cold guard was then filled with liquid hydrogen,\nthe test tank was retopped until full, and the access cover had again chilled down to the\nliquid-hydrogen temperature. The reference pressure in the tank pressure control\nsystem was set slightly lower than the minimum test tank pressure experienced during\n0\nthe filling and retopping procedure (1.07xlO 5 to 1 . 2 1 ~ 1 5 N/m 2 (15.5 to 17.5 psia)),\nand the back pressure control system was brought online to control the pressures in\nthe test tank and cold guard. The liquid-hydrogen boiloff gas was vented through the\no to 3.4 standard cubic meter per hour (0 to 2 standard f t3 /min) mass flowmeter as\nsoon as the flow rate was within that range. The test was continued until steady-state\nMLI system temperature and liquid-hydrogen boiloff flow rate conditions had been\nachieved; generally, about 3 days were required. Steady-state MLI system temperature conditions were assumed to have been achieved when the temperatures did not\nchange more than 0.56 K (1.0\' R) over a period of at least 5 hours.\nFor tests 1, 3, 5, 7 , 9, and 18, where the tests were dedicated to measuring only\nthe vacuum space-hold thermal performance of the insulation system, the initial test\nprocedure w a s somewhat different. The vacuulll chamber was evacuated to the\nnewton per square meter (lom5torr) range with the insulation system at ambient temperature for approximately 2 i days to reduce any outgassing occurring within the insulation to a relatively low value. The test tank and cold guard were then filled with liquid hydrogen at approximately 1 . 4 ~ 15 newtons per square meter (20 psia) Once the\n0\ntanks had been filled, the back-pressure control system was brought online, and the\ntest was completed in the same manner as noted previously.\n\n.\n\n18\n\nRepres s u riz ation Test\n\nAfter the space-hold thermal performance test had been completed, the remaining\nliquid hydrogen was removed from the test tank and cold guard. The flow lines in the\npurge gas system between the vacuum chamber isolation valves and the two flow-control\nvalves mentioned earlier were vacuum purged. The gaseous-helium supply pressures\nupstream of the flow control were set to the desired values. The three oil diffusion\npumps were then valved off, and the repressurization sequence was started. The flowcontrol valves were opened on a predetermined schedule (1) to provide a rate of increase of the pressure in the vacuum chamber to approximate that expected in the cargo\nbay of the Space Shuttle Orbiter during atmospheric reentry and (2) to maintain a positive pressure differential across the MLI system. When the chamber pressure reached\na l-atmosphere absolute pressure, the chamber vent valve was opened, and the test\nwas terminated.\n\nDATA REDUCTION\nPurge Gas Flow Rates\nThe purge gas flow rates for the MLI system and the free volume of the vacuum\nchamber were calculated in terms of the mass flow rate and the volumetric flow rate.\nThe volumetric flow rates, normalized in terms of the number of volumes per hours,\nwere calculated from\n\nwhere, for the MLI system,\n\nV\n\naverage MLI temperature, K (OR)\nMLI system volume, m 3 (ft3)\n\nP\n\nvacuum chamber pressure, N/m 2 (psia)\n\nT\n\nor, for the free volume of the vacuum chamber,\nT\n\naverage shroud temperature, K CR)\n\nV\n\nvacuum chamber free volume, m 3 (ft3)\nvacuum chamber pressure, N/m 2 (psia)\n\nP\n\n19\n\nThe volume of the MLI system was calculated to be 0.186 cubic meter (6.58 f t 3) while\nthe free volume of the vacuum chamber was calculated to be 5.695 cubic meters\n(201.1 ft3).\n\nMeasured Heat Inputs\nThe total heat input into the test tank during both the ground-hold and space-hold\nthermal performance tests was calculated from\n\nThe density ratio factor is a correction for the portion of the liquid-hydrogen boiloff\nthat was not vented from the test tank but merely occupied the space vacated by the\nevaporated liquid. The second term takes into account the heating of the remaining\nboiloff gas to some higher outlet temperature prior to being vented from the tank. The\nvalue of the enthalpy of the boiloff gas at the tant vent (hTv) was evaluated at the ullage\ngas temperature indicated by the PRT located inside the tank at the 1.5-percent ullage\nlevel.\nExtraneous heat inputs into the test tank attributed to the PRT instrumentation\nwires, purge tubing, vent and f i l l lines, tank support struts, and Nylon positioning pins\nwere assumed to result from solid conduction heat transfer. The heat inputs were calculated from measured temperatures and thermophysical properties of the materials\ninvolved using the Fourier heat-transfer equation\n\nQcond\n\n=A\n11\n\nl\n:\n\nK(T)dT\n\n(4)\n\nPredicted Ground- Hold Thermal Performance\nThe heat input through the MLI system into the test tank during the ground-hold\nconditions was predicted assuming gaseous-helium conduction heat transfer through\neach blanket of insulation using the measured temperatures of the cover sheets for each\ntest. The increased overall thickness of the insulation system in the areas near the top\nand bottom of the test tank where the inner conical MLI panels overlapped the inner MLI\ngore panels (fig. 12) was accounted for. Overall, the ground-hold heat flux was calcu-\n\n20\n\nlated to be approximately 690 watts per square meter (220 Btu/hr-ft 2) assuming the\nthickness of each MLI blanket was 0 . 9 5 centimeter (0.38 in.).\n\nPredicted Space-Hold Thermal Performance\nThe predicted heat input into the test tank attributed to the basic thermal performance of the multilayer insulation was calculated using the following equation obtained\nfrom reference 5:\n\nwhere\nC1 = 8 . 95X10-8\nC2 = 5.39X10 -10\n\nFor a gaseous nitrogen background (test l),\n\nc3= 1.10x10 2\nC4 = 0 . 5 2\n\nand for a gaseous helium background (tests 7 and 18)\nC3 = 3.67X10 2)\n\nC4 = 0 . 2 6\n\nThe average measured temperatures of the inside and outside cover sheets of the MLI\nsystem were used for temperatures Tc and Th, respectively. The outside surface\nareas of the conical MLI panels and MLI gore panels of 2 . 2 7 9 and 4 . 5 5 5 square meters\n2\n(24.53 and 4 9 . 0 3 f t ), respectively, were used to calculate the total predicted MLI heat\ninput.\nThe predicted MLI temperature profiles were calculated by using the initially predicted MLI heat flux along with equation (5) to calculate the individual radiation shield\n21\n\ntemperatures, starting with the inner cover sheet temperature and working toward the\nnext warmer radiation shield.\nThe heat input into the test tank due to the presence of the seams o r butt joints between adjacent MLI panels was estimated using a value for seam degradation of 0.169\nwatt per meter (0.17 6 Btu/hr-ft) of seam length determined in reference 6. This value\nwas determined for an offset butt joint with overlapping cover sheets, which is the typical seam configuration for the butt joints between adjacent MLI gore panels (fig. 9).\nThere were approximately 7.22 meters (23.7 ft) of seams (primarily between adjacent\nMLI gore panels) in this MLI configuration tested. The length of the butt joints between\nthe inner blanket MLI gore panels extending past the outer blanket MLI gore panels near\nthe top and bottom of the test tank were neglected. There were also approximately 6.37\nmeters (20.9 ft) of seams between the MLI gore panels and the conical MLI panels at\nthe top and bottom of the test tank. Although this seam configuration (as shown in fig. 8)\ndid not match exactly the standard offset butt joint configuration used between adjacent\nMLI gore panels, the same value for seam degradation noted previously was arbitrarily\nassumed for the thermal degradation.\nThe heat input into the test tank due to the thermal degradation of the multilayer insulation in the vicinity of the tank support struts was also estimated by using a value of\n0.403 watt (1.376 Btu/hr) for each penetration as determined in reference 6. Any effect of the relatively close spacing between the tank support struts for each of the three\npairs of struts was neglected.\n\nRE SULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe results of the experimental test program a r e discussed under five main headings :\n1. Space-Hold Thermal Performance - Results from tests 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 18,\nwhich were dedicated to measuring only the thermal performance of the insulation system under vacuum conditions\n2. Ground-Hold Thermal Performance - Results from test 8, which was dedicated\nto measuring only the thermal performance of the insulation system with gaseous helium at a l-atmosphere pressure within and surrounding the insulation\n3. Thermal Cycles - Results from tests 10-1 to 13, in which the complete thermal\ncycle of gaseous-helium purging, liquid-hydrogen fill, ground-hold conditions,\nvacuum chamber pumpdown, transition to vacuum space-hold conditions, and\nrepressurization of the insulation system and vacuum chamber back to a\nl-atmosphere pressure were imposed\n\n22\n\n4. Degradation Due to Moisture - &,sults from tests 14 to 17, which had essentially\nthe same test conditions as the thermal cycle tests except that the insulation\nsystem was subjected to a 100-percent relative humidity environment prior to\nstarting each test\n5. Posttest Inspection Results of inspecting the MLI system after all testing was\ncompleted\nThe previous test history of the MLI system reported in reference 4 is summarized\nin table 1 1 These tests were primarily ambient temperature helium purge tests. The\n1.\ntests were interspersed with four space-hold thermal performance tests to determine if\nanything done to the MLI system during the conduct of the purge tests had affected the\nthermal performance of the insulation system.\nThe basic test sequence of the test program reported herein is shown in table TV.\nThe tests were numbered such that all tests in a given series (test 10, e. g.) had nearly\nidentical test conditions; the -5, for example, indicated that this was the fifth such test\nin the series. Test 8 was conducted to determine the initial ground-hold thermal performance of the insulation system. This test was followed by another space-hold\nthermal performance test to again determine if the ground-hold conditions had done anything to alter the thermal performance of the insulation under vacuum conditions. The\nthermal cycles imposed on the insulation system by simulating the environmental conditions of a typical space mission w e r e started with test 10-1. For tests 10-1 to 10-5,\nthese environmental conditions included (1)purging the MLI to remove condensible\ngases prior to filling the propellant tank with liquid hydrogen, (2) 1-atmosphere pressure ground-hold conditions, (3) venting the MLI during atmospheric pressure decay to\nvacuum conditions, and (4) vacuum space-hold conditions. For the experimental tests\nstarting with test 11-1, the environmental conditions simulating repressurization of the\nMLI system during atmospheric reentry were added to complete the thermal cycle.\nW a t e r was added to the vacuum chamber for varying periods of time before starting the\npurging to provide an initial 100-percent relative humidity environment for tests 14-2\nto 17-2. The final test (test 18) was another space-hold thermal performance test in\nwhich the MLI system was subjected to a vacuum environment (to outgas any residual\nwater left within the insulation from previous tests) for 5 days prior to filling the test\ntank with liquid hydrogen.\n\n-\n\nSpace-Hold Thermal Performance\nThe total measured heat input into the test tank for the space-hold thermal performance tests along with the measured component heat inputs through the tank support\nstruts, the Nylon positioning pins, and other extraneous sources are shown in table V.\n23\n\nd\n\nSubtracting the component heat inputs from the total tank heat input leaves the total heat\ninput attributed to the multilayer insulation itself. The initial baseline space-hold heat\ninput (test 1)attributed to the MLI was 7.18 watts (24.5 Btu/hr). The MLI heat input\nfor the first four tests averaged 7.40 watts (25.3 Btu/hr) with a maximum deviation of\n6 percent. This is a relatively small deviation in the experimental data considering\nthe purge testing conducted between the thermal performance tests and the general nature of the heat transfer through multilayer insulations. This average heat-transfer\nrate corresponds to a boiloff rate of 1.45 percent of the tank volume per day.\nThe measured temperature profiles through the MLI for tests 1 and 7 a r e shown in\nfigure 18. The only significant difference between the two temperature profiles is the\nlower temperatures of the inner cover sheet of the inner blanket MLI gore panels for\ntest 7 . This difference was apparently due to the fact that test 7 followed the initial\n344 K (620\' R) temperature purge test (test 6B), which may have caused the inner\nblanket gore panels to more fully conform to the shape of the tank wall and thus allow\nmore intimate contact with the wall. The basic heat input through the MLI gore and\nconical panels was calculated using the measured hot and cold insulation boundary temperatures shown in figure 18 along with equation (5). The resulting calculated basic\nMLIheat inputs a r e shown in table V along with the MLI thermal degradation calculated\nfor the seams and tank support strut penetrations. The total calculated MLI heat input\nwas 7.94 and 8.00 watts (27.1 and 27.3 Btu/hr) for tests 1and 7, respectively. These\npredicted heat inputs are of the order of 8 percent higher than the average measured\nheat input.\nAlso shown in figure 18 are the calculated MLI temperature profiles for tests 1\nand 7 . The profiles were calculated using equation (5) and moving from shield to shield\nstarting with the coldest radiation shield (cover sheet). The calculated profiles compare reasonably well with the experimental data.\nThe space-hold thermal performance for test 9 that was obtained after the initial\nground-hold thermal performance test indicated a slightly lower heat input to the test\ntank than measured previously (table V) The reason for this is not specifically known.\nHowever, imposing the ground-hold environmental conditions on the MLI system certainly did not degrade the subsequent space-hold thermal performance, which was the\nprimary question to be resolved.\n\n.\n\nGround-Hold Thermal Performance (Test 8)\n\nTest 8 was the first experimental test in which the MLI system was subjected to a\nground-hold environment. The M U system and vacuum chamber contained 100-percent\ngaseous helium. The helium purge rates were 0.22 and 1.03 kilograms per hour (0.49\nand 2.27 lb/hr) for the MLI system and the vacuum chamber, respectively. The MLI\n24\n\na\n\nsystem purge rate was chosen such that a positive flow of helium purge gas out of the\nMLI system would still be expected throughout the transient temperature conditions\nexisting for a tank f i l l and insulation chilldown time of 20 minutes. The liquid-hydrogen\nboiloff rate measured with the venturi was 24.5 kilograms per hocr (54.0 lb/hr), and\nthe ullage gas temperature within the test tank at the vent line was 30.2 K (54.3\' R),\nwhich resulted in a measured heat input of 3848 watts (13 140 Btu/hr). Of this value,\napproximately 3 . 0 watts (10 Btu/hr) were composed of extraneous heat inputs (as noted\nin the DATA REDUCTION section) so that the heat input attributed directly to the NIL1\nsystem was 3845 watts (13 130 Btu/hr). This heat input corresponds to a boiloff rate\nof 31.4 percent of the tank volume per hour. The liquid-hydrogen level in the tank for\nthis particular test was between the 9.5- and 15.0-percent ullage levels.\nThe predicted heat input for this ground-hold test was 4762 watts (16 260 Btu/hr).\nTherefore, the measured heat input was approximately 19 percent lower than the predicted heat input. This discrepancy between the measured and predicted values could\nnot be accounted for since the predicted heat input was based on using five local insulation temperature profiles in different areas of the MLI system along with the thermal\nconductivity values for gaseous helium. One possible explanation is that the individual\nMLI blankets became "fluffed-up" slightly during the ground-hold purge conditions,\nthereby increasing the nominal thickness of the insulation.\nAn additional test was conducted during this overall ground-hold thermal test to t r y\nto determine the apparent density of the liquid hydrogen within the test tank under the\nrelatively high heat-flux conditions. This information is desirable since it determines\nthe maximum mass of liquid hydrogen that can be loaded into the tank when the liquid\nis boiling vigorously and has gas bubbles entrained within the bulk liquid. During this\ntest, the PRT\'s within the test tank were used as liquid level sensors. The lower five\nPRT\'s on the instrumentation rake ranged from 20.0 to 26.7 K (36\' to 48\' R) and responded quickly (within a few seconds) to the increased ullage gas temperature when the\nsensors emerged from the liquid hydrogen. The test procedure was to (1) note when\nthe normal-boiling liquid-hydrogen surface had just passed one PRT, (2) rapidly pressurize the test tank with ambient temperature gaseous hydrogen to suppress the boiling,\nand (3) note how manyPRT\'s emerged from the liquid a s the liquid level decreased due\nto the momentary collapse of vapor bubbles within the liquid. The test results for two\ntests are noted in table VI. In the first of these tests, the initial liquid level started at\nthe 5.19-percent ullage level. A s the tank was pressurized, the next three lower PRT\'s\nemerged from the liquid, but the PRT located at the 15-percent ullage level did not. In\nthe second test, the initial liquid level started at the 6.50-percent ullage level. A f t e r\n38.4 seconds, the PRT located at the 15-percent ullage level indicated that it was uncovered. The liquid surface probably did not drop much past this level. In this case,\nthe change in liquid volume between the boiling and nonboiling conditions was 0 . 1 2 1\n25\n\ncubic meter (4.26 f t3). The calculated apparent density of the normal-boiling liquid hydrogen at a l-atmosphere pressure would then be 64.4 kilograms per cubic meter (4.02\nlb/ft3). This represents a reduction of 9 percent from the normal density of nonboiling\nliquid hydrogen.\n\nThermal Cycles (Tests 10-1 to 13)\n\n-\n\nTests 10-1 to 1 3 were basically thermal cycling tests\nMLI temperature history.\nto determine if repetitive thermal cycling of the insulation system during simulated\nspace-flight environmental conditions would degrade the thermal performance of the insulation. The test conditions were varied somewhat during these 1 1 tests a s noted in\ntable N. The temperature history of the MLI during a typical test (e. g., test 11-3) is\nshown in figure 19. The temperatures shown are for thermocouples on the cover sheets\nof the two MLI blankets located on the lower half of the MLI gore panels. The temperatures noted as being for the intermediate cover sheets are the average temperatures\nfor the outer sheet of the inner blanket and the inner cover sheet of the outer blanket of\ninsulation. These temperatures were generally within a few degrees of each other.\nThese temperature data were obtained in the control room from the digital panel\nmeters. The MLI system was initially purged with gaseous helium for slightly more\nthan 3 hours with the purge gas and shroud heaters set at 350 K (630\xc2\xb0 R) for this test.\nThe insulation reached 344 K (620\' R) for approximately the last hour of the purge test.\nThe purge gas heater was then shut off, and the shroud heaters were reset to 300 K\n(540\' R). The test tank was filled with liquid hydrogen, and the ground-hold conditions\nwere established. During this time the insulation temperatures decreased rapidly to\nthe normal ground-hold temperature profile, and the liquid-hydrogen boiloff flow rate\nwas determined. The nominal ground-hold temperatures were approximately 215, 145,\nand 20 K (387\', 261\xc2\xb0, and 36\' R) for the outer, intermediate, and inner cover sheets,\nrespectively. The vacuum chamber was then pumped down to vacuum conditions a s\nrapidly as possible. During this time, the cold helium purge gas adjacent to the tank\nwall vented through the MLI system caused the outer and intermediate cover sheet temperatures to decrease rapidly to approximately 140 and 80 K (252\' and 144\' R), respectively. The outer cover sheet temperature recovered quickly and reached its final\nsteady-state space-hold temperature of 299 K (539\' R) within several hours. The intermediate cover sheet temperature increased more slowly and did not reach its final\nsteady-state value of 227 K (409\' R) until more than 60 hours after the vacuum chamber\nhad been pumped down. The same was true of the inner cover sheet which finally\nreached a steady-state temperature of 35.6 K (64O R). After the final steady-state\nspace-hold thermal performance measurements had been recorded, the test tank was\n26\n\npressurized and the liquid hydrogen was drained from the tank. The variations in the\ninsulation temperatures noted during this tiw.e were due to a partial loss of vacuum in\nthe vacuum chamber caused by tubing connections experiencing transient temperatures\nand leaking slightly. After draining the test tank, vacuum levels in the chamber were\nrestored to the - 2 ~ 1 0 - newton per square meter ( l ~ l O torr) range. The vacuum\n~\n-~\nchamber and insulation system were then repressurized to a 1-atmosphere pressure\nwith gaseous helium; this condition provided the resulting variations in the insulation\ntemperature as shown in figure 19.\nVacuum chamber pressure history. - Typical vacuum chamber pressure histories\nfor the pumpdown and repressurization phases of the tests are shown in figure 20 (again\nfor test 11-3). During the pumpdown only the time period from 8 to 1 2 minutes provided a reasonable simulation of the rate of pressure decay to be expected in the cargo\nbay of the Space Shuttle Orbiter (ref. 7); the rate of pressure decay in the first 8 minutes was, in general, too slow. The vacuum chamber repressurization did provide a\nreasonably good simulation of the environment expected in the cargo bay of the Space\nShuttle Orbiter.\nPurge test results. - The results from the gaseous-helium purge phase of tests\n10-1 to 13 are shown in figure 21. The gaseous-helium purge rates for these tests\n(shown in table IV) for the MLI system of approximately 0 . 9 5 and 1.10 kilograms per\nhour (2.1 and 2.4 lb/hr) and for MLI temperatures of 344 and 300 K (620\xc2\xb0 and 540\' R),\nrespectively, resulted in purge rates of approximately 36 MLI volumes per hour. Likewise, vacuum chamber purge rates of approximately 1.8 and 2 . 2 kilograms per hour\n(4.0 and 4.9 lb/hr) for shroud temperatures of 351 and 300 K (632\' and 540\' R), respectively, provided helium purge rates of approximately 2.4 vacuum chamber volumes\nper hour. These were approximately the same as the test conditions for tests 2D-1,\n2D-2, 4A, 4B, and 6B for the test program previously conducted (table 111).\nThe measured gaseous-nitrogen concentration as a function of time from the start\nof the purge test for four joint sampling locations is shown in figures 21(a) to (d). The\ngaseous-nitrogen concentrations obtained at the butt joints for tests 12-1 and 13 indicated approximately the same rate of reduction in nitrogen concentration a s that obtained in the earlier purge tests conducted (ref. 4) for similar helium purge conditions.\nThe data for the remaining purge tests shown in figures 21(a) to (d) indicate that the nitrogen concentration at the butt joint was reduced at a somewhat slower rate, although\nthe difference is slight for the lower cone - gore panel butt joint (fig. 21(d)). The reason for this is not known specifically, but it is believed to be due to some slight shifting of the insulation panels as the insulation is subjected to the repeated purge, pumpdown, and repressurization cycles during the experimental tests. Any shifting of the\nMLI panels could cause variations in the w dth of the gap a t the butt joints between the\nedges of the panels. This could affect the flow of purge gas through the butt joint and,\n27\n\ntherefore, influence the rate of reduction of nitrogen concentration (ref. 8). There was\nalso a shorter time interval between the points when gas samples were obtained for\ntests 12-1 and 13. It is believed that this did not influence the measured gaseous nitrogen concentrations, however, since they have been previously shown to be unaffected by\ngas sampling intervals ranging from 20 minutes to 1 hour for the type of gas sampling\nsystem utilized (refs. 8 and 9). The faired curves drawn through the bulk of the data in\nfigures 2 1 (a) to (d) were used as the boundary conditions at the edges of the MLI panels\nto predict the gaseous nitrogen concentrations within the MLI panels. Typical times\nrequired to reduce the gaseous nitrogen concentrations to 1percent at the butt joints\nwere 147 minutes for the upper and lower cone - gore panel butt joints, 132 minutes for\nthe butt joint at the upper half of the gore panel, and 114 minutes for the butt joint at\nthe lower half of the gore panel. No data were obtained at the butt joints for test 10-1\nbecause the thermal conductivity cell used to measure those gas concentrations was inoperative for that test.\nThe measured gaseous-nitrogen concentrations at four of the gas sampling locations within the MLI panels a r e shown in figures 21(e) to (h). These data indicate the\nsame trends as already noted by the data for the butt joints. Typical times required to\nobtain l-percent-gaseous-nitrogen concentrations, for the bulk of the data, ranged from\napproximately 120 minutes near the top of the tank to approximately 170 minutes near\nthe bottom of the tank. The curves drawn in figures 2l(e) to (h) are predicted gaseousnitrogen concentrations obtained using the analytical computer program described in\nreference 4 along with the boundary conditions noted earlier for figures 2l(a) to (d).\nThe value of the diffusion coefficient used was obtained from reference 9. The predicted rate of reduction in gaseous-nitrogen concentration was somewhat slower than that\nmeasured for the MLI sampling points for the upper half of the tank; this is due to the\nnatural bouyancy of the gaseous helium promoting an upward flow toward the top of the\ntank within the MLI panels that is not accounted for in the analytical program. For the\nMLI on the lower half of the tank, the measured and predicted concentrations agreed\nfairly well.\nGround-hold thermal performance. - The measured and predicted ground-hold\nthermal performance of the insulation system is shown in figure 22. The measured\nheat input attributed directly to the MLI for most of these tests was approximately 4000\nwatts (13 700 Btu/hr), although the heat input decreased to approximately 3600 watts\n(12 300 Btu/hr) for test 13. The amount of liquid hydrogen in the test tank varied somewhat from test to test; however, the liquid surface was generally in the vicinity of the\nPRT located at the 5.19-percent ullage level. The PRT located at the 1.50-percent\nullage level always indicated it was in gaseous hydrogen, while the PRT located at the\n6.50-percent ullage level indicated that it was always immersed in liquid hydrogen.\nThe liquid level was above the 5.19-percent ullage level for tests 10-2 and 10-5 to 13.\n28\nd\n\nchange in boiloff flow-rate measurement devices from a venturi to a flat-plate oriprovided no difference in the measured flow rate. The predicted ground-hold therperformance, based on measured insulation temperatures and gaseous-helium therconductivity, remained at approximately 47 50 watts (16 200 Btu/hr)\nThe measured insulation temperature profiles obtained during ground-hold conditions for several of the tests are shown in figure 23. The temperatures on the upper\ncone were considerably warmer and tended to vary somewhat more from test to test\nthan the temperatures f o r the gore panel and lower cone. The warmer temperatures\nwere most probably caused by the natural convection of the helium purge gas rising\ntoward the top of the upper cone. The discontinuity in the faired curve for the lower\ncone is most probably caused by the existence of a separation between the inner and\nouter blankets of MLI due to the technique of mounting the insulation system on the test\ntank. The temperatures shown for the gore panels represent averages of the temperatures at the three locations on the centerline of individual gore panels; these temperatures showed very little variation with location.\nTransient heat input. - The heat input to the test tank attributed to the MLI during\nthe transition from ground-hold to space-hold vacuum conditions is shown in figure 24\nfor test 11-3, which is typical of all the tests in this series (data for test 16-2 will be\ndiscussed later). The heat input reached a minimum value 4 to 6 hours after the start\nof the vacuum chamber pumpdown because of the decrease in the insulation temperatures (fig. 19) caused by venting the cold helium purge gas adjacent to the tank wall.\nThe heat input increased as the insulation warmed up and reached a steady-state value\napproximately 45 hours after the start of the vacuum chamber pumpdown.\nSpace-hold thermal performance. - The measured heat inputs to the test tank during the steady-state portions of the space-hold thermal performance tests are tabulated\nin table VII. The one exception is test 10-1 for which steady-state conditions were not\nachieved. The miscellaneous heat inputs as well as those for the tank support struts\nand Nylon positioning pins remained relatively constant from one test to the next. The\nvacuum levels measured within the shroud were sufficiently low such that gaseous conduction through the insulation should not be a significant mode of heat transfer. The\nresulting heat input to the test tank attributed to the MLI alone is tabulated in table VI1\nand is also plotted in figure 25. In general, the NIL1 heat input tended to steady out at\n7.50 watts (25.6 Btu/hr) as typified by test 13, for example. The space-hold thermal\nperformance was not significantly affected by (1) thermal cycling, (2) the addition of the\nrepressurization sequence to simulate the complete thermal cycle (test ll), (3) the\nchange in insulation temperatures during purging from 344 to 300 K (620\' to 540\' R)\n(test 12), o r (4)the repressurization sequence utilizing gaseous nitrogen rather than\ngaseous helium to repressurize the vacuum chamber (test 12-2).\nRepressurization. - The repressurization sequence utilizing gaseous nitrogen for\nThe\nfice\nmal\nmal\n\n.\n\n29\n\nthe vacuum chamber repressurization had already been demonstrated to be ineffective in\nmaintaining low concentrations of nitrogen within the MLI system with the test tank and\nMLI at ambient temperature (ref. 4). This repressurization sequence was attempted\n1\nonce more in this series of tests with the test tank walls cold ( ~ 1 1 K (200\' R)) and with\nthe insulation temperatures varying between 88 and 262 K (158\' and 472\' R) (test 12-2).\nThe gaseous-nitrogen concentration within the MLI system at the end of the repressurization sequence varied from 78 to 60 percent. While the gaseous-helium flow under the\nMLI system during the repressurization did not prevent gaseous nitrogen (and presumedly water vapor if it had also been present) from entering the MLI system, no degradation to the subsequent space-hold thermal performance of the insulation system (test 13)\nwas noted.\n\nDegradation Due to Moisture (Tests 14 to 17)\n\n.\n\nThe purpose of this series of tests was to determine if moisture (water) introduced\ninto the vacuum chamber and MLI system prior to purging the MLI would degrade the\nspace-hold thermal performance of the insulation. Approximately 100 cubic centimeters (6.1 in. 3) of water, depending on the assumed temperature of the vacuum chamber and MLI system, was calculated to be sufficient to provide a 100-percent relative\nhumidity environment within the vacuum chamber. For this series of tests, the vacuum\nchamber was initially backfilled with gaseous nitrogen, o r gaseous helium (test 16),\nfrom vacuum conditions to approximately 7x104 newtons per square meter (10 psia).\nThe water was then introduced into the vacuum chamber, and the resulting environmental pressure within the chamber was maintained until just prior to starting the purge\ntest when the chamber pressure was increased to a 1-atmosphere pressure with gasV.\neous nitrogen o r helium (table I )\nFor test 14-1, the water was intended to be added in the form of vapor through the\nMLI purge tubing by heating the water in a closed metal container connected to the MLI\npurge manifold. However, when the metal container w a s disconnected after the purge\ntest had been started, it was found that very little, if any, water had been introduced into the MLI system and vacuum chamber. For test 14-2, it was intended initially to add\n3\n150 cubic centimeters (9.2 in. ) of liquid water through the MLI purge tubing. This\ntime, however, the water apparently froze in the MLI purge manifold and blocked the\nsmall diameter purge orifices after an undetermined amount of water had been added to\nthe vacuum chamber. An additional 150 cubic centimeters (9.2 in. 3, of water were then\nadded through the chamber vent line near the bottom of the vacuum chamber. For tests\n15-1 to 17-1, all the water was added through the chamber vent line. For test 17-2,\nthe chamber was backfilled to a 1-atmosphere pressure and an open container of water\nwas placed on top of the shroud through a service port in the chamber lid. The insula30\n\ntion was exposed to the 100-percent relative humidity environment for approximately\n2 hours before purging for tests 14-2 to 16.1 (table IV). For tests 16-2 to 17-2, the\nexposure time was increased to as long a s 8 weeks.\nPurge test results. - The purge test results for those tests k which the vacuum\nchamber was initially backfilled with gaseous nitrogen (tests 14-1 to 15-2 and tests 17-1\nV\nand 17.2, table l )a r e shown in figure 26. The data for the boundary conditions at the\nbutt joints a r e shown in figures 26(a) to (d). Although the data again show a considerable amount of variation from one test to the next, the results do not, in general, differ\nsignificantly from those already shown for previous tests (fig. 21). The exceptions a r e\nfor the sampling locations on the lower half of the tank for test 14-2, which shows a\nconsiderably slower rate of decrease in the nitrogen concentration than previously,\nparticularly for the last half of the purge test. This may be due to the two purge orifices being at least partially blocked by frozen water which may have still existed in the\nMLI purge manifold for this particular test. The data for test 15-2 a r e shown by means\nof double symbols; the first symbol being the indicated nitrogen concentration after\n60 seconds of flow through the sampling tube, and the flagged symbol being the indicated\nconcentration after an additional 15 seconds of flow. These data confirmed that the additional 15 seconds of sampling time did not significantly influence the measured results.\nThe faired curves drawn through the data for the slowest and the fastest rates of reduction in nitrogen concentration (tests 14-2 and 15-1, respectively) were used a s inputs to\nthe analytical computer program to predict the resulting concentration within the MLI\npanels,\nThe measured nitrogen concentrations within the MLI panels a r e shown in figures\n26(e) to (h) along with the calculated concentrations for tests 14-2 and 15-1. The experimental data, in general, reflect the trends established by the nitrogen concentrations\nat the adjacent butt joints. The variation in data from test to test, therefore, is believed to be real and simply reflects the varying purge characteristics of the insulation\nsystem a s it is subjected to repeated thermal and pumpdown - repressurization cycles.\nThe calculated concentrations agree with the experimental data reasonably well except\nwhere the buoyancy of the helium purge gas aided the purge process on the upper half of\nthe tank.\nGround-hold thermal performance.\nThe measured and predicted ground-hold\nthermal performance of the insulation system for tests 14-1 to 17.2 is shown in figure 22. The measured heat input attributed to the NIL1 averaged approximately 3600\nwatts (12 300 Btu/hr) for these tests. The measured heat input of about 3000 watts\n(10 200 Btu/hr) for test 16-1 was considerably lower than for the other tests; the reason\nfor this is not specifically known. The predicted heat input for these tests tended to remain at approximately 4750 watts (16 200 Btu/hr) except for tests 16-1 and 17-2 for\nwhich it was somewhat higher. This was due to a somewhat higher overall temperature\n\n-\n\n31\n\nd\n\ndifference across the insulation as indicated in figure 23 for test 16-1. No predicted\nground-hold heat input was available for test 16-2 (fig. 22) because the required digital\nhigh-speed data was lost.\nMLI temperature history. The MLI temperature history during one of the tests\n(i.e., test 16-2) in this series in which moisture had been added to the vacuum chamber\nis shown in figure 27 starting with the vacuum chamber pumpdown. The temperature\nhistory for test 11-3 where no moisture had been added is also shown for comparison.\nFor test 16-2, the insulation had been subjected to a 100-percent relative humidity environment for 65 hours prior to starting the ambient temperature purge test (table IV).\nAn initial gaseous-helium background was used for this test, and the helium purge of the\ninsulation was continued for only 1 hour so that the effect of a relatively large amountof\nmoisture remaining within the MLI system could be determined. The major effect on the\nMLI temperature history was the rapid rise of the intermediate cover sheet temperature\nto a level higher than the normal steady-state space-hold value shorter after the vacuum\nchamber was pumped down to vacuum conditions. This was probably due to a high rate\nof outgassing of water vapor in the outer MLI blanket and perhaps the outer layers of\nthe inner MLI blanket. The increased outgassing would cause a higher interstitial pressure within the MLI blankets which would provide a relatively high gaseous conduction\nheat-transfer rate between radiation shields in these portions of the MLI blankets. The\nhigher rate of heat transfer would tend to lower the outside surface temperature of the\ninsulation (where heat transfer would still be primarily by radiation alone) while elevating the temperatures within the insulation system. As the outgassing rate decreased\nbecause of the diminishing amounts of water vapor remaining within the MLI blankets,\nthe outer and intermediate cover sheet temperatures gradually approached their normal\nsteady-state values of approximately 299 and 217 K (539\' and 391\' R), respectively.\nDuring the transition to steady-state conditions, it was noted that the vacuum chamber and shroud vacuum levels would fluctuate erratically from time to time indicating\ntemporarily high outgassing rates that would tend to overpower the vacuum pumps. The\ntemperature fluctuations of the inner cover sheet, in particular, were apparently due to\nthe sporadic outgassing of the absorbed or frozen water vapor and the resultant fluctuations in vacuum level within the vacuum chamber. A s the space-hold test continued,\nthe fluctuations in the vacuum level became less pronounced, and a fairly steady vacuum\nlevel was present during the last 1to 2 days of the test.\nThe temperature history shown for test 16-2 in figure 27 is typical of tests 14-2\nto 17.2. The MLI temperature history for test 14-1 was similar to that shown for test\n11-3 in that it indicated no significant amounts of water vapor had been added to the\nvacuum chamber prior to starting test 14-1 by the technique utilized for that particular\n\n-\n\ntest.\nTransient heat input.\n32\n\nd\n\n- The effect of\n\nthe residual water vapor outgassing within the\n\nMLI system and the resulting elevated MLI temperatures on the heat input into the test\ntank attributed to the MLI during the transition to steady-state space-hold conditions for\ntest 16-2 is shown in figure 24. The heat input remained at a value of approximately\n14 watts (48 Btu/hr) for a period of several hours while the interzediate cover sheet\ntemperature reached its maximum value and started to decrease. The heat input then\ndecreased and reached its steady-state space-hold value approximately 60 to 65 hours\nafter the start of the vacuum chamber pumpdown.\nThe measured heat inputs into the test tank\nSpace-hold thermal performance.\nduring the steady-state portions of the space-hold thermal performance tests for this\nseries of tests, as well as those from reference 4, are tabulated in table VII. The resulting heat input to the test tank attributed to the MLI is also tabulated in table VII and\nis plotted in figure 25. The thermal performance of the insulation for test 14-1 w a s not\ndegraded at all from the previous values; this is another indication that no water vapor\nactually got into the vacuum chamber. For the remaining tests, some degradation in\nthe thermal performance of the insulation was noted. However, the amount of degradation ranged from only 5.5 to 18.8 percent of the nominal heat input of 7.50 watts (25.6\nBtu/hr) for test 13. Since the range of the experimentally measured thermal performance of even flat samples of DAM/silk net insulation (as well a s other MLI systems)\nmay vary as much as &lo percent from the predicted performance (ref. 5), the degradation in thermal performance due to the presence of water vapor observed in this investigation does not seem to be particularly significant, Neither the time duration of the\nhelium purge nor the purge gas temperature appeared to have any significant effect on\nthe degree of thermal degradation. There was some indication that longer exposure\ntimes to water vapor (tests 16-2 to 17-2) tended to increase the degree of thermal degradation, but it was not conclusive.\n\n-\n\nFinal Space-Hold Thermal Performance (Test 18)\n\nA final space-hold thermal performance test (test 18) was conducted to determine\nif the previous exposure of the insulation system to the water vapor had resulted in any\npermanent damage to the MLI. The vacuum chamber was pumped down and the insulation was exposed to a vacuum environment a t ambient temperature for 5 days to remove\nany residual water vapor from the MLI prior to filling the test tank with liquid hydrogen.\nThe resulting heat input attributed to the MLI (tables V and VI1 and fig. 25) was 8.04\nwatts (27.5 Btu/hr). This was only 7.2 percent greater than the nominal thermal performance of 7.50 watts (25.6 Btu/hr) achieved for test 13 prior to the thermal degradation tests. It was also lower than at least one previous space-hold thermal performance test (test 10-5) and was very close to the predicted performance of 7.98 watts\n33\n\n(27.2 Btu/hr) for test 13 as noted in table V. It was concluded, therefore, that little if\nany permanent damage to the insulation system resulted as a consequence of the exposure to a 100-percent relative humidity environment.\n\nPosttest Inspection of MLI System\nDuring the conduct of the complete test program (tests 1to 18), the insulated test\ntank was installed in the vacuum chamber for just over 1year without being removed.\nA f t e r the test program had been completed, the test tank was removed from the vacuum\nchamber, and the insulation system was inspected visually. The exterior surface of\nthe insulation appeared to be coated with a very light film of diffusion pump oil; all\nother surfaces within the vacuum chamber appeared to be clean and dry. All of the\nVelcro fastener material checked was still mated and holding. Almost all of the aluminized Mylar tape was still well bonded adhesively to the surfaces to which it was attached. The gas sampling tubes were still in the proper locations. No structural damage of any sort to the insulation system was noted.\nThe emissivity of several of the radiation shields in two of the MLI panels was\nchecked with the Gier Dunkle reflectometer. For 25 readings taken on the aluminized\nMylar radiation shields the average total hemispherical emissivity was 0.050, which\nindicated that no degradation of the MLI system due to exposure to water vapor had\noccurred. The aluminized surfaces of the radiation surfaces still appeared bright and\nshiny; no peeling of the aluminizing from the Mylar plastic film was observed.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nA comparison of the two reusable insulation systems reported in references 2 and 3\nwith the insulation system tested in this investigation is tabulated in table VIII. The\nDGK/Dacron tuft MLI system (ref. 2) reportedly gave excellent thermal performance\n(0.60 W/m 2 (0.19 Btu/hr-ft 2)), but it suffered from weight penalties (3.71 kg-W/m4\n(0.241 lbm-Btu/hr-ft 4)) due to using the fiberglass tank fairings and purge bag. The\nthermal performance of the two DAM/silk net MLI systems ("1.38 W/m2 (0.438 Btu/\nhr-ft 2)) was about equal. Both were poorer than that of the DGK/Dacron tuft MLI system, although theDAM/silk net system was more efficient when the weight of the system\n4\nwas included (2.37 to 2.68 kg-W/m4 (0.154 to 0.174 lbm-Btu/hr-ft )). The DGKDacron\ntuft MLI system would be difficult to apply to a double-contoured tank surface (except\nfor perhaps a large tank) because of the difficulties that would be encountered in folding\n(or cutting) and taping the radiation shields to conform to the tank surface. The use\nof the s i l k netting a s a spacer material allows the forming to be readily accomplished.\n34\n\nThe trade-off between the two MLI systems, therefore, is really the better thermal\nperformance of the DGK/Dacron tuft system as against the potentially lower cost and\nease of fabrication of the DAM/silk net system, assuming they both meet all other requirements.\nIt also appeared that certain improvements could be made in the MLI system reported in this investigation to improve its basic thermal performance. These potential\nimprovements include the following:\n(1) Eliminate the Nylon positioning pins and grommets at the equator of the tank\n(2) Revise the insulation system configuration near the top and bottom of the tank so\nthat the positioning pins located there do not penetrate the MLI panels\n(3) Eliminate the Y-type MLI panel joint between the conical MLI panels and the\ngore panels for the inner MLI blanket and use instead the more conventional\nbutt joint configuration\n(4) U s e a better technique for installing the insulation around the tank support\nbrackets and struts (such as noted in refs. 10 and 11, e.g.)\n(5) Reduce the seam o r butt joint length\nIn regard to the last item, the seam length could be decreased by reducing the number of gore panels in a given MLI blanket o r by changing the gore panel half-angle 8\ng\'\nThe seam length can be calculated for half the propellant tank from\n\nThe results are shown in figure 28 for the particular size test tank and insulation thickness used in this test program. The number of gore panels per MLI blanket could have\nbeen reduced from 6 to 4 and still have stayed within the limitations imposed by the\nmaximum width of the insulation materials available. Also, the gore panel half-angle\neg could have been increased somewhat (perhaps from 45\' to 50\xc2\xb0, e. g. ) . These modifications to the insulation system would have reduced the total seam length for half the\ntank from 6.56 to 5.39 meters (21.5 to 17.7 ft). The total heat input into the test tank\nthen would have been reduced by 0.40 watt (1.35 Btu/hr), a reduction of about 5.3 percent from the nominal MLI heat input of 7 . 5 0 watts (25.6 Btu/hr) for test 13.\nA second possible technique for reducing the seam length would be to leave the gore\npanel half-angle 13 fixed and to increase the length of the gore panels to extend part\ng\nway up the conical sections. For this case, the seam length for half the tank can be determined from\n\n35\n\nThe results are shown in figure 29 for the current test tank and a gore panel half-angle\nIn this case, the seam length can be reduced only by reducing the number\n0 of 45\'.\ng\nof MLI gore panels per blanket to four. Using any larger number only results in increasing the total seam length as the gore panels are extended up on the conical section.\nThe heat input into the upper half of the test tank attributed to the MLI, considering\nthe different heat fluxes through the MLI for the gore panels and conical panels as well\nas the thermal degradation due to the seams, can be predicted from\n\nwhere I s is determined from equation (6) and\n\n(rMLI\ncos\nsin 0 g\n\n- rzi\n\nThe predicted heat input to the upper half of the test tank a s a function of the number of\ngore panels per blanket and the gore panel half-angle 8 is shown in figure 30 for the\ng\nfollowing heat fluxes:\n= 0.492 W/m2 (0.156 Btu/hr-ft2)\n\nio0.457 W/m 2 (0,145 Btu/hr-ft2)\n=\n\nqs\n\n= 0.169\n\nW/m (0.176 Btu/hr-ft)\n\nDecreasing the number of gore panels per blanket, in particular, can significantly reduce the heat input into the tank. Assuming that the upper and lower halves of the tank\nhad the same MLI system configuration and using heat inputs taken from figure 30, the\ntotal MLI system heat input into the test tank for the current MLI system would be predicted to be 8.91 watts (30.4 Btu/hr) as noted in table M. If the number of gore panels\nwere reduced to four, the gore panel half-angle was increased to 50\xc2\xb0, the thermal degradation of the MLI near the tank support struts was reduced by 50 percent, and the heat\n36\n\ninput through the Nylon positioning pins was eliminated, the resulting predicted heat input would be 6.22 watts (21 .2 Btu/hr), an improvement of 30.2 percent. All these improvements are realistic and could be realized with generally minor changes in the MLI\nsystem design.\nOne additional improvement in the MLI system design could be made if it was desirable to decrease the time required to purge the insulation to less than l-percentgaseous-nitrogen concentration and to achieve a more uniform purge gas concentration\nfrom the top to the bottom of the insulation. This would be to provide a slotted plastic\npurge pin at the bottom of the tank which would penetrate the lower conical MLI panels\nexcept for the outer cover sheet of the outer MLI blanket. The purge pin would be attached to the lower fiberglass cone on the longitudinal centerline of the tank. The pin\nwould distribute the helium purge gas between the individual radiation shields. A positive flow of purge gas would be supplied through one additional purge tube. It is estimated that this would reduce the total purge time for the lower conical MLI panels by\n3 to 1hour.\n\nSUMMARY O F RESULTS\nAn experimental investigation was conducted to determine (1) the ground-hold and\nspace-hold thermal performance of a MLI system mounted on a spherical liquid hydrogen propellant tank and (2) the degradation to the space-hold thermal performance of the\nMLI system that occurred as a result of both thermal cycling and moisture introduced\ninto the insulation panels. The propellant tank had a diameter of 1.39 meters (4.57 ft).\nThe MLI consisted of two blankets of insulation; each blanket contained 15 doublealuminized Mylar radiation shields alternated with 16 double silk net spacers. A laminated aluminized Mylar/Dacron scrim sheet w a s applied to each side of each blanket.\nThe MLI system configuration used six 60\xc2\xb0-gore MLI panels, one upper conical MLI\npanel, and one lower conical MLI panel in each blanket.\nNineteen tests simulating typical cryogenic spacecraft thermal (environmental) conditions were conducted. Each thermal cycle imposed on the insulation system typically\nconsisted of either a 300 o r a 344 K (540\' o r 620\' R) temperature gaseous-helium\npurge, a l-atmopshere environmental-pres sure tank fill and ground-hold condition, a\nvacuum chamber pumpdown and vacuum space-hold condition, and a repressurization of\nthe vacuum chamber insulation system back to a l-atmosphere pressure condition.\nPrior to each of the last seven tests, water vapor was introduced into the vacuum chamber for varying periods before initiating the gaseous-helium purge to determine the subsequent effect on the space-hold thermal performance of the insulation system. The\nfollowing results were obtained from this test program:\n\n37\n\n1. The initial baseline space-hold thermal performance test conducted indicated\nthat the nominal heat input attributed to the MLI system under vacuum conditions was\n7.18 watts (24.5 B t u h r ) . The average heat input for the first four space-hold tests was\n7.40 watts (25.3 B t u h r ) with a maximum deviation of 6 percent. This heat-transfer\nrate corresponded to a boiloff rate of 1.45 percent of the tank volume p e r day. The predicted heat input of approximately 8.00 watts (27.3 Btu/hr), calculated using the experimentally measured insulation cover sheet temperatures, was 8 percent higher than the\naverage measured heat input.\n2. The initial ground-hold heat input attributed to the MLI system was 3845 watts\n(13 130 Btu/hr), which w a s approximately 19 percent less than the predicted heat input\nof 4762 watts (16 260 Btu/hr) calculated using the experimentally measured cover sheet\ntemperatures. The measured heat input corresponded to a boiloff rate of 31.4 percent\nof the tank volume per hour. Determining the change in the liquid hydrogen level in tEe\ntank when the normal boiling of the hydrogen w a s suppressed indicated that the apparent\nliquid hydrogen density under ground-hold high-heat-flux boiling conditions w a s 64.4\nkilograms per cubic meter (4.02 lb/ft 3).\n3. Typical times required to purge the initial condensible (nitrogen) gas from within\nthe MLI panels with helium to achieve a 1-percent-gaseous-nitrogen concentration\nranged from approximately 120 minutes near the top of the tank to approximately\n170 minutes near the bottom of the tank. The experimental purge times required to\nachieve l-percent gaseous nitrogen sometimes varied from test to test. This was\nthought to be a result of changing purge conditions and not a result of instrumentation\ne r r o r o r measurement technique.\n4. During the pumpdown of the vacuum chamber, the temperatures of the intermediate and outer insulation cover sheets on the gore panels initially decreased from their\nnormal ground-hold values of approximately 145 and 215 K (261\' and 387\' R), respectively, to approximately 80 and 140 K (144\' and 252\' R). The insulation panels were\nchilled down by the cold helium purge gas adjacent to the tank wall venting through the\ninsulation when the vacuum chamber was pumped down.\n5. Without the presence of water vapor within the insulation systems, the transition\nfrom the pumpdown to space-hold steady-state conditions was characterized by a rapid\nincrease in the outer cover sheet temperature and a gradual increase in the intermediate\ncover sheet temperature to their final steady-state values of approximately 299 and\n227 K (539\' and 409\' R), respectively. The liquid-hydrogen boiloff rate initially decreased and then gradually increased to its final space-hold steady-state value. The\nboiloff rate achieved its steady-state value approximately 48 hours after the vacuum\nchamber was pumped down, while the intermediate cover sheet temperatures required\napproximately 60 hours to reach steady state. Neither the initial purge temperatures of\n300 o r 344 K (540\' o r 620\' R) nor the thermal cycles imposed on the insulation system\n\n38\nd\n\ninfluenced the resulting space-hold thermal performance to any discernable degree.\nThe insulation system heat input at the end of this series of tests settled out at approximately 7.50 watts (25 6 Btu/hr) during space-hold vacuum conditions.\n6. For the tests where water had been added to the vacuum chamber to provide\nloo-percent relative humidity conditions prior to the start of the test, the transition\nfrom the pumpdown to space-hold steady-state conditions was characterized initially by\na fairly rapid increase in both the outer and intermediate cover sheet temperatures\nThis was followed by a gradual decrease in the intermediate cover sheet temperature to\nits f i n d steady-state value of approximately 217 K (391\' R). Also, the liquid-hydrogen\nboiloff rate was observed to gradually decrease to its final space-hold steady-state\nvalue. These changes in the transition to steady-state conditions from that noted previously for the tests without exposure to water vapor were apparently due to outgassing\nof water vapor in the insulation blankets causing a higher initial heat flux. However,\nthe times for both the insulation temperature and liquid-hydrogen boiloff to reach\nsteady-state values were approximately the same a s noted previously for the tests without water vapor. The presence of the water vapor resulted in MLI space-hold heat inputs a s high a s 8 . 9 1 watts (30.4 Btu/hr), which is approximately 19 percent higher than\nthe nominal values obtained in the previous tests without water vapor.\n7. The variation in purge temperatures from 300 to 344 K (540\' to 620\' R) caused\nlittle effect in the resulting space-hold thermal performance and apparently was not effective in removing additional amounts of water vapor from within the insulation system\nShorter purge times and longer initial exposure times apparently allowed some increased amounts of water vapor to remain in the insulation system after purging and resulted in somewhat increased insulation heat inputs during space-hold vacuum conditions.\n8. The final space-hold thermal performance test indicated that the heat input attributed to the MLI system had been restored to 8 . 0 4 watts (27.5 Btu/hr). This was very\nclose to the predicted heat input of 7.98 watts (27.2 Btu/hr) and was only 7 . 2 percent\ngreater than the nominal space-hold thermal performance of 7.50 watts (25.6 Btu/hr)\n9 . A posttest inspection of the MLI system revealed that no structural damage had\noccurred a s a result of the purge, pumpdown, and repressurization conditions imposed.\nIn addition, no degradation of the emissivity of the radiation shields was measured.\n10. It appears that improvements could be made in the insulation system configuration tested to reduce the space-hold heat input into the liquid-hydrogen propellant tank.\nChanges in the MLI system configuration, such a s elimination of the Nylon positioning\npins, reduction of the number of gore panels per blanket from 6 to 4, increase in the\ngore panel half-angle from 45\' to 50\xc2\xb0, and change in the technique of insulating around\nthe tank support struts to provide a 50-percent reduction in the degradation of the NIL1\ndue to the penetration of the tank support brackets and struts, could result in a reduction\n~\n\n.\n\n39\n\nof the total heat input from 8.91 watts (30.4 Btu/hr) that was measured for test 13 (typical of the thermal cycle tests) to 6.22 watts (21.2 Btu/hr), a decrease of 30.2 percent.\nLewis Research Center,\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration,\nCleveland, Ohio, March 14, 1978,\n506-21.\nREFERENCES\n1.
