NDE simulation tools may someday aid in the design and certification of advanced aerospace components; potentially shortening the time from material development to implementation by industry and government. Furthermore, modeling and simulation are expected to play a significant future role in validating the capabilities and limitations of guided wave based structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. The current state-of-the-art in ultrasonic NDE/SHM simulation cannot rapidly simulate damage detection techniques for large scale, complex geometry composite components/vehicles with realistic damage types. This paper discusses some of the challenges of model development and validation for composites, such as the level of realism and scale of simulation needed for NASA' applications. Ongoing model development work is described along with examples of model validation studies. The paper will also discuss examples of the use of simulation tools at NASA to develop new damage characterization methods, and associated challenges of validating those methods.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160006472, "endDate": "2015-07-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "QNDE Conference", "location": "Minneapolis, MN", "id": "4f13ce1d3ab24793a14a5dc8170cb097", "startDate": "2015-07-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160006472, "id": "2cdbaebba0ce4a9c83051537f80c50e9", "publicationDate": "2015-07-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160006472.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160006472/downloads/20160006472.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160006472/downloads/20160006472.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160006472/downloads/20160006472.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
