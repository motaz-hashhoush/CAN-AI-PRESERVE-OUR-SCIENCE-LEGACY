Automated\ndata compression\nprocedures\nare used to improve\nthe efficiency of station data communications.\nIn addition, the UNIX environment\nsupports a number of semi-automated\ntechnical and administrative\noperational\nstation tasks. The x\nwindow user interface generates multiple simultaneous\ncolor graphics displays,\nproviding direct\noperator visibility and control over a wide range of operational\nstation functions.\n\n9-49\n\nHP UPGRADE\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nSTREAMLINING\n\nThe successful integration\nof new HP computer resources into the Crustal Dynamics\nProject (CDP)\nSatellite Laser Ranging (SLR) Network as part of the lip Upgrade Project has led to critically needed\nimprovements\nin data system capability and significant\ngains in network operational\nefficiency.\nThis\npaper provides a brief description of the liP Upgrade Project strategy and progress to date in\nstreamlining\nstation operations.\nThe FIP Upgrade Project was initiated in 1987 to prepare the CDP SLR Network to meet the\noperational\nchallenges presented by multi-satellite\ntracking operations\nin the 1990\'s. The technical\napproach for the EIP Upgrade Project was based on the recommendations\nof the CDP Computer Panel,\nwhich recognized\nthat new s_tion requirements\nto support up to ten operational satellites and to\nproduce on site normal points could not be supported by existing station computer\nresources. The\nexisting computer\nresources recorded tracking data on floppy disk or magnetic tape and required\nmanpower intensive operations\nto reload the data back into the computer to support station data\nprocessing activity. In addition, data processing operations\nand satellite tracking operations\ncould not\nbe performed at the same time. Therefore,\ndata processing operations\nhad to be scheduled around\nperiods of operational\ntracking and were typically\nperformed\nat the end of an operational\nshift. These\nproblems delayed the production\nof data products and severely limited network tracking productivity.\nThe basic lip Upgrade Project strategy was to integrate a second computer system into the existing\nstation configuration\nto provide the required\nadditional\ncomputer resources.\nIn 1988 the first HP computer\nsystems were purchased,\nand development\nof EIP Upgrade prototype\nsystems started at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and at the University of Texas. The\ndevelopment\nof a parallel prototype at the University of Texas was necessary to address the unique\nrequirements\nof a lunar tracking station. HP UNIX software development\nprojects were shared\nbetween GSFC and the University\nof Texas to reduce critical software development\ntimelines and to\nmaintain design consistency.\nThe Moblas 7 and MLRS liP prototype systems were successfully\ntested in 1990. In 1991, the HP\nUpgrade was deployed to the remaining network operational\nMoblas systems and development\nstarted\non lip Upgrades for TLRS 3, TLRS 4, and Hollas. The TLRS 3, TLRS 4, and Hollas HP Upgrades are\nexpected to be completed in 1992.\nIn order to reduce the load on critical station manpower and computer resources, the HP data\nsystem was designed to provide fully automated\ndata communications\nand data processing during\nmulti-satellite\noperations.\nFigure ] presents a simplified\ndiagram of HP data syst_\nfunctions,\nThe\nfunctions associated with real time tracking operations are divided between the controller and liP\ncomputers.\nOther Non real time HIP functions, which include general station operations and automated\npost tracking functions complete the automated\nHP Data System Product Cycle. Depending\non the\nnumber of observations\nin the pass, the HP Data System was designed to produce the normal point\ndata\n\nproduct\n\nI to 5 minutes\n\nafter the operator\n\nhas closed\n\n9-50\n\nout the operational\n\ndata set. The time\n\nrequired to compress the normal point data set and transmit the data product to headquarters is less\nthan I minute.\nThe HP Data System has built in flexibility which allows interleaving of multiple satellite and\ncalibration sets. The code has been written to allow for many different combinations of hardware\nsettings. This has been accomplished via the use of different levels of ranging activity. By changing\nlevels within the software, the operator may determine which calibration sets (with possibly different\nhardware characteristics) go with which satellite sets. Up to five different levels may be selected. This\nfeature makes it possible to quickly switch from one satellite to another and back again using\ncalibration sets which may be unique for each satellite. Figure 2 is an example of a single shift of\nMoblas 4 support scheduling multiple satellite and calibration operations. Scheduled ERS-1, Ajisai,\nLagcos, Etalon 1, Etalon 2, and Starlette passes are labeled El, AJ, LI, MT, NT, and ST respectively.\nScheduled calibration tracking is labeled C1. The activity scheduled at the bottom is the sum of\nscheduled satellite and calibration activities. The station is continuously ranging satellites or the\ncalibration target for over 5 hours during the shift. The scheduling of multi-satellite operations has\nsignificantly increased the operational productivity of operational laser stations. Additional\ninformation concerning the scheduling of multi-satellite tracking operations is presented in another\nEight International Workshop on Laser Ranging Instrumentation paper "SATCOP Mission Planning\nSoftware Package".\nControl of all processing and maintenance operations is provided by a mouse and/or keyboard\ndriven, user friendly multi-level menu interface. These menu controlled operations include data\narchiving, tuned IRV prediction communications, data product statistics review, station\ncommunications, semi-automated daily tracking operations reports, and other general station data\ncommunications. The user interface is written in the \'C\' programming language and uses the Motif/x\nwindows style and flavor. The use of this industry standard ensures that the user interface is consistent\nwith other operating systems On addition to UNIX) and is also consistent with widely available off-theshelf commercial software.\nThe design prototype for the second "processing" computer system was a UNIX based HP 360\nworkstation. Low cost upgrades have brought the design prototype up the the current CDP SLR\nnetwork configuration described in Figure 3. The HP 380 computer configuration includes two 332 MB\nhard disks to improve efficiency by directing data operations to one disk and operating system\nfunctions to the other disk. A 650 MB optical disk is included to provide on llne data archlving, a\nefficient backup media, and to support major software system upgrades. The 67 MB cartridge tape is\nused as a low cost media for generating weekly full rate mailing tapes. The HP Paintjet printer\nsupports local hard copy requirements. The 19.2k baud modem supports a wide range of station\ncommunication\nrequirements including data communications\nand software system updates. The 16\ninch color supports the X-Window environment and is the primary user control interface device for the\nHP Data System.\nThe Moblas, MLRS, TLRS, and Hollas systems all have unique controller computer hardware and\nsoftware environments. Real time control functions may also vary station to station (MLRS is a lunar\nstation, for example). The HI\' Upgrade development strategy was to minimizf the impact on real time\ncontroller functions, requiring only real time data communications to the lip "processing computer"\nand off load as many non real time functions as possible from the controller to the "processing\ncomputer". A simplified functional block diagram for TLRS 3/4 is presented in figure 4. The controller\n\n9-51\n\n(or tracking) computer performance in managing the real time computer interfaces was a key technical\ndesign problem for each station type.\nReal time applications were developed in C in the lip UNIX environment to record and manage the\nflow of raw data measurements\nfrom the controller computer to the HP 380. Automated C and Fortran\napplications assemble, screen, and prepare the raw data measurements\nfor automated data processing.\nBased on inputs from the system operator, automated data processing functions start as soon as the\nraw data set is complete.\nThe lip UNIX software environment, with includes FORTRAN and C applications, was selected to\nmake maximmn use of existing operational software, provide multi-vendor hardware portability, and\nto provide a robust industry x window user interface for station operations. The HP Upgrade Project\nsoftware strategy was to develop real time applications in C and other data system applications in\nFORTRAN to make the best use of current operational software. The station user interface was\ndeveloped in the lip UNIX x window environment to make the best use of the HI"380 workstation\nresources in controlling station operations.\nIn order to meet the new station normal point data system requirements and maintain data system\nintegrity, operational data system software was rehosted from VAX/VMS Fortran to lip UNIX\nFortran. The field data processing system was designed to use identical data processing algorithms and\nto perform the same basic data processing and data quality control functions as the operational\nheadquarters system. These data processing functions include quality control of raw data\nmeasurements, calibration data processing, computation of satellite ranging corrections, analytical\nsatellite data fitting, and satellite data compression to form normal points. The field data processing\nsystem was designed to produce the same operational quality control statistics and data products as the\nheadquarters system. These data statistics and data products were carefully benchmarked against the\noperational headquarters data system before the HP Data System was declared operational Some\nsoftware system utilities used in the VAX/VMS environment had to be replaced with equivalent HP\nUNIX utilities during software rehosting.\nThe HP Data System Upgrade has been successfully operating at Moblas 4, Moblas 5, Moblas 7,\nand MLRS for over a year, producing on site normal points, generated within minutes of operational\nsatellite tracking. Starting in April 1992, muiti-satellite operations were successfully integrated into the\nlip Upgrade Data System, contributing to recent record data production by Moblas 4 and Moblas 8.\nUpgrades to the_HP workstation CPU\'s have been successfully accomplished in the field without\nsoftware system modifications and have enabled the HP Data System to accommodate massive\nincreases in data volume associated with muiti-satellite operations and two shift network support for\nTOPEX. Remote software system updates have been performed using modem communications,\nwithout\nimpacting station operations. The automation of the Data System has helped free up critical station\nmanpower resources needed to sustain nearly continuous tracking operations associated with multisatellite support. The HP Upgrade is the first major step in streamlining CDP SLR operations.\nStrategic technical planning to replace the controller computer, providing necessary computer\nresources to automate other station functions, is in progress. In addition, direct computer network\ncommunications to CDP SLR network stations is expected to be established in the near future,\nproviding advanced communication resources to automate remote software system management\nactivities and global data communications.\n\n9-52\n\n-+BENDI\nHP DATA\n\nSYSTEM\n\nOFFLINE FUNCTIONS\n\nPRODUCT\n\nGENERAL STATION\n\nSTATION COMMUNICATIONS\nADMINISTRATION\nSTAR CALIBRATION\nSCHEDUUNG\nDATA SYSTEM SETUP\nSTATION ARCHIVING\n\nI\nI\n\nCYCLE\n\nCONTROLLER\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nFUNCTIONS\n\nTASK SCHEDULING\nOPERATOR INPUI_\nANALYTICAL COMPUTATIONS\nEQUIPMENT CONTROL\nMEASUREMENT RECORDING\nDATA PREPARATION\nDATA COMMUNICATIONS\nDATA DISPLAYS\n\nREAL TIME TRACKING\nOPERATIONS\n\nHP FUNCTIONS\nTASK SCHEDULING\nOPERATOR CONTROL\nDATA COMMUNICATIONS\nDATA PREPARATION\nDATA V ERIFICATION\nDATA DISPLAYS\n\n,,.,I\n\nDATA PROCESSING FUNCTIONS\n(1 TO 5 MIN)\nOPERATOR CLOSEOUT\nDATA AGGREGATION\nMAILER RLE\nDATA VERIFICATION\nCALIBRATION PROCESSING\nSATELLITE PROCESSING\nDATA REPORTS\nARCHIVING\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2DATA COMMUNICATIONS\n(1 MIN)\n\nPOSTTRACKING\nOPERATIONS\n\nFUNCTIONS\n\nDATA COMPRESSION\nCOMMUNICATION CONNECTION\nTRANSMISSION\n\n--CDSLR\'-r\nFIGURE\n9-53\n\n1\n\n9-54\n\nr\n\n,,,,,1\n\nJ\n9-55\n\nI---I\nIE\nI_\n\n--\n\nJ_r\'--_\nI_i_,i\n\n__\n\n_-\n\n_\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n--"C\'l\n+I\n_II\n\nI I_ \xc2\xa3..I\nI I-I_I\nI _\n,\n\'4,\'\n\n_\n\nI\nI::I\n_I\nml\n\n___l_\n\n;1+_1\n\nr -:Ol\n\n_1\n\n__\n..\n\ni\n\n_\n\n= _\n\nI\n\n_\n\n,.\n\n_ I P,\n"_ i\n\nlint\n\nI\n\nII\ni -- / -\'I-....\nL\'\n\n_\n\n,\n\n-\n\n: m f./3\n\n==Is I I-_%"I Io,_+I\n\n.\n\n,,__+\n\nI_I--\n\n--\n\nira_\n._>,,,\n_I\n\n+<\n\n_\n\nI\xc2\xa2.\',\'3\'_iI\nl--<J\n\n++\n\n_\n\n_\n\n-\n\nI\n\n_l\n\nI\n\nI=\n\n\'il\n\n\xc2\xa2:+II_I\n\nI\n\nt_____ -+"L+\n\n-I\n\nr\n\n[ ................\n\n, I\nI\n\nI.,+I.+ +\xc2\xb0I.[\n,_.,\nI ===, ,\'\no\n_+_\n\'\xc2\xb0- \' \xc2\xb0\'=\' +\n\n/\n\nt,,.- _\n\n_,_\nI =:\n\nI\n\nI--\n\n_1 i\nI\n\n-.+_\'\n\n1\n\n_.._\n\n_+P I +1\nI+1 =+,\',,\n,, I+, I<--I_,I\n__+;\n\n,,,\n, , ,....,\nt\n_\'\n,4+,+# ,--I--.........\nJ\nIo\n\n,.+,I + :+ _\n,--+\nI\n\n......\n\ni\n\nI\n\n\',_\'++\n\n_\n\n!1 I\n\nr\'_\n\n+\n,-;LU"I -_I\n--+r+l+\n_+,\nE_\n\n;_-I+ _r\n_++:\n_\nI-_\'I\no, I\nO"\n_--"I I +=\'-_ I\n:+\niI,.+.t<-_ "_ I\' l__+E_ > o %1\nI t,._.._\n...._...J\n#\n_\'J" L i _\n\nt\n9-56\n\n'
