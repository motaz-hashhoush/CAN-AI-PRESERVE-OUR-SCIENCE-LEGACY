INTRODUCTION\nThe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s ice cover exhibits an enormous influence on global climate through the regulation of energy and\nmoisture exchanges between the ocean, atmosphere, and land; and through the potential of the great ice sheets to\nraise sea level dramatically. History and projections of global climate suggest that the high-latitude ice-covered\nregions of the Earth, particularly the Arctic, have high sensitivity to climate change. The polar regions of Earth\nhave been experiencing rapid change. In some parts of the Arctic, wintertime average temperatures have climbed\nas much as 4\xc2\xb0C since the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s, several times greater than the average global pace. Extensive melting and\ndynamic thinning has been observed of the Greenland ice sheet. Much of the permafrost present for centuries\nappears to be thawing releasing methane and other gases. The Arctic Basin is ice free for longer periods each\nyear and on average sea ice is 15% thinner than 50 years ago. Taken together, these data suggest a faster-thanexpected response to global warming.\n\nUnder the auspices of the 2010 International Polar Year (IPY), Arctic nations have made key investments in\nmonitoring the Arctic region to enhance understanding of this rapidly changing region. As a result of the IPY\nactivities, there is strong interest in improving data sets, models, and decision-making tools related to key\nscientific processes and management of assets of the Arctic region. Deficiencies in these areas contribute to\nslower than acceptable pace of equipping and training partner nations to address environmental and resource\nmanagement issues in the Arctic. Further, this results in partnership operational shortfalls and inconsistent\nregional and national institutionalization / utilization of data products and model outputs. The Arctic\nCollaborative Environment (ACE) project will address the challenge of establishing international partnerships for\ninformation needs at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. The goal of ACE is to create an open source,\nweb-based, multi-national monitoring, analysis, and visualization decision-support system for Arctic\nenvironmental assessment, management, and sustainability. Monitoring and predicting change in sea ice extent\n\nand condition and for improved monitoring of real-time changes in the permafrost and the associated release of\nmethane are two high priority topics.\n\n2. SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ARCHITECTURE\nACE is modeled after SERVIR, a proven NASA project operational in Central America and East Africa, which\nempowers local users at globally-distributed nodes with the hardware and software tools necessary to integrate\nsatellite observations, ground-based data and forecast models to monitor and forecast environmental changes and\nto improve response to natural disasters. Likewise, ACE will establish a regional node in the U.S. and national\nand remote access user nodes at partner nations with Arctic interests to enable scientists and educators improved\nability to study the Arctic\xe2\x80\x99s response to climate change and to enable project managers and policy\nimplementers better responds to a range of issues including transportation and mobility, emergency management,\nconstruction of off shore oil rigs or pipelines, optimal conditions and routes for Inuit hunting and fishing (Fig. 1).\nNodes will be equipped to provide access to raw data resources, processing and computational resources, access\nto analytical data and model output and data sharing capabilities with partners.\n3. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\nACE will be initiated with funding from the United States government and be managed by NASA Marshall Space\nFlight Center. A Regional Node is under development and will temporarily be housed at the National Space\nScience and Technology Center (NSSTC) in Huntsville, Alabama. User Requirements and Product Development\nWorking Groups have been established and are active in providing definition to ACE. The team is working to\nsecure participation of Canada (Canadian Ice Service), Russia, Germany, Norway, and other Arctic nations. The\nnumber and extent of National Nodes in these and other nations at the outset is still under review and are part of\nthe negotiations with the proposed international partners. The ACE team has socialized these activities with the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and has submitted formal proposals to Canada and\nRussia. In addition to identifying user requirements, system capabilities, and product development needs, the\ninitial phase of the ACE Project also will include setting up multiple Remote Access User sites.\n\nThe ACE project team has identified a broad set of users including National Navies and Coast Guards; regional,\nnational and local governments with territorial claims in the Arctic region; Inuit and Aleut Tribes and Local\nJurisdictions; Commercial Shipping; and the Arctic Science Research Community. The initial set of common\nfunctions executed by these groups include maritime safety; maritime and on-ice search and rescue; Economic\nExclusion Zone (EEZ) management; strategic movement; in-situ mobility; infrastructure design and development;\ncoastal zone mapping; hydrographic surveys; environmental management; inter-agency and international\n\nFig. 1.

Based on preliminary inputs from these groups, two topics have emerged as\nhigh priorities, sea ice and permafrost.\n\nAt the end of Year 1, ACE will conduct an operational demonstration of its developing capabilities. At the\nconclusion of this activity, the Regional Node will be relocated to the Sustained Arctic Observing Network\n(SAON) at the National Ice Center, which is a collaboration between NOAA, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Coast Guard.\nThe node at the NSSTC will remain the foci for developing and prototyping additional capabilities.\n4. SUMMARY\nThe Arctic Collaborative Environment (ACE) project is a new international partnership for information sharing to\nmeet the challenges of addressing Arctic. The goal of ACE is to create an open source, web-based, multi-national\nmonitoring, analysis, and visualization decision-support system for Arctic environmental assessment,\nmanagement, and sustainability. This paper will describe the concept, system architecture, and data products that\nare being developed and disseminated among partners and independent users through remote access.\n\n'
