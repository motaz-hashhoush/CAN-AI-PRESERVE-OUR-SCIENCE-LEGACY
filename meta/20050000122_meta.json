The theoretical statistics for circular data (random points on a unit circle) or spherical data (random points on a unit sphere) are a recent development. An overview of existing graphical methods for the display of directional data is given. Cross-over occurs when periodic data are measured on a scale for the measurement of linear variables. For example, if angle is represented by a linear color gradient changing uniformly from dark blue at -180 degrees to bright red at +180 degrees, the color image will be discontinuous at +180 degrees and -180 degrees, which are the same location. The resultant color would depend on the direction of approach to the cross-over point. A new graphical method for imaging directional data is described, which affords high resolution without color discontinuity from \"cross-over\". It is called the circular data image. The circular data image uses a circular color scale in which colors repeat periodically. Some examples of the circular data image include direction of earth winds on a global scale, rocket motor internal flow, earth global magnetic field direction, and rocket motor nozzle vector direction vs. time.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050000122, "id": "18ac9e1c6e204c398a9a877b1034705b", "publicationName": "Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050000122.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050000122/downloads/20050000122.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050000122/downloads/20050000122.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050000122/downloads/20050000122.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
