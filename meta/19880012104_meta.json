The space station, as conceived, is constructed in orbit and will be maintained in orbit. The construction, servicing, maintenance and deployment tasks, when coupled with the size of the station, dictate that some form of transportation and manipulation device be conceived. The Transporter described will work in conjunction with the Orbiter and an Assembly Work Platform (AWP) to construct the Work Station. The Transporter will also work in conjunction with the Mobile Remote Servicer to service and install payloads, retrieve, service and deploy satellites, and service and maintain the station itself. The Transporter involved in station construction when mounted on the AWP and later supporting a maintenance or inspection task with the Mobile Remote Servicer and the Flight Telerobotic Servicer is shown.", "title": "Space station mobile transporter", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T18:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880012104, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Renshall, James"}, "organization": {"name": "Astro Aerospace Corp.", "location": "Carpinteria, CA, United States"}}, "id": "aacb1e8a85f74324a74d6af117466687"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880012104, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Marks, Geoff W."}, "organization": {"name": "Astro Aerospace Corp.", "location": "Carpinteria, CA, United States"}}, "id": "2a961f34f170445bb2f3451179966db0"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19880012104, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Young, Grant L."}, "organization": {"name": "Astro Aerospace Corp.", "location": "Carpinteria, CA, United States"}}, "id": "ae662a2f196f4554b997c3ecc8722a8c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880012104, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880012104, "id": "b8fdd0e242894ee9b43240fd3af90761", "publicationName": "NASA.
