b'Security in Full-Force\n\nI\n\nCOMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFFS\n\nn the wake of September 11, 2001 and the\nensuing demand for stringent homeland\nsecurity measures, organizations worldwide are\ngoing to greater lengths to safeguard their\nbusiness practices. While NASA is among the\nranks of those constantly evaluating their\nsecurity infrastructures, the Agency is firmly\nshielded by a gold-standard protection system,\nthanks to an ongoing relationship with Vanguard\nIntegrity Professionals of Las Vegas, Nevada.\nNASA teamed up with Vanguard shortly after\nthe Chaos Computer Club of Hamburg, West\nGermany, hacked into the NASA Space Physics\nAnalysis Network (SPAN) in early 1987. The\nunlawful intrusion was not discovered by NASA\nuntil 3 months later in July. In addition, NASA\nlearned that the Space Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s Primary Avionics Software System (PASS) flight software code\nhad been compromised in November of that\nsame year.\nThis led to the formation of the Joint\nMission Operations Directorate/Mission Support\nDirectorate Resource Access Control Facility\nTeam in April of 1988. Tasked with performing\na forensic investigation, the team unveiled that\nthe security rules for the PASS data file were\ndeleted on June 11, 1987, as a result of a\nhuman error made by an authorized security\nadministrator. Essentially, the programs that\nNASA utilized to protect the lives of American\nastronauts and enable them to perform critical\ntasks of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s space program had\nproven vulnerable to both malicious attack and\nhuman error.\nLike the ever vigilant\neye, Vanguard\nEnforcer\xe2\x84\xa2 monitors the\nconstant stream of data\nin and out of the server\nsystem. As unauthorized\nattempts to access data\nare noticed by the system,\nit shuts down entry to\nthe files before\ninformation can be\ncopied, removed, or\ncorrupted.\n\n134\n\nCOMPUTER TECHNOLOGY\n\nIn June of 1988, NASA recruited the IBM\nAmerica Team to perform an assessment of the\nSoftware Development Facility (SDF). Within\nmonths of this date, the Mission Support\nDirectorate (MSD) formed its own security\ncommittee to address specific issues within the\nSDF and other MSD-managed systems. The\ncommittee recommended that several actions be\ntaken, including training and certification of\nsecurity administrators. The thorough evaluation\nprocess concluded that the only way to provide\nfault tolerant security would be to implement a\nsystem that did not require human intervention.\nSubsequently, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s MSD/SDF approved the\ndevelopment of an automated security monitoring and enforcement system that would prevent\nhuman error and deliberate attacks. Work on a\nsecurity software platform that would later\nbecome known as \xe2\x80\x9cEnforcer\xe2\x80\x9d began in March\nof 1989.\nDuring that same year, a request for proposal\nwas issued to create and implement the security\nadministration certification program for NASA.\nVanguard was awarded the contract, and\nsubsequently, developed the NASA Security\nAdministrator Certification Program. Vanguard\nalso instructed, tested, and certified the\nAgency\xe2\x80\x99s security administrators.\nMeanwhile, work continued on the development of Enforcer. Ronn Bailey, Vanguard\xe2\x80\x99s chief\nexecutive officer and chief technology officer,\ninformally consulted with the makers on\nproduct design. When fully developed for\nNASA, the software system\xe2\x80\x94which emulates the\nactivities of highly technical\nsecurity system programmers,\nauditors, and administrators\xe2\x80\x94\nwas among the first intrusion\ndetection programs to restrict\nhuman errors from affecting\nsecurity, and to ensure the\nintegrity of a computer\xe2\x80\x99s\noperating systems, as well as\nthe protection of mission\ncritical resources. The first\nversion of Enforcer, now\nknown as the Vanguard\nEnforcer,\xe2\x84\xa2 was delivered in\n1991 to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Johnson Space\nCenter and has been protecting\nsystems and critical data there\never since.\n\nmainframes behind the Internet, networks,\nand firewalls.\nWith this in mind, Vanguard is committed\nto expand upon its success with NASA to\ndeliver superior security technology to corporations and other various entities all across the\nNation. According to Bailey, \xe2\x80\x9cEnforcer is the\nfirst security software developed to defend a\nsystem against its own authorized users.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe\ntake great pride in knowing that this technology\nis protecting all manned space program missions. Vanguard is honored to bring this\nadvanced security technology to all businesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne customer that has benefited from the\nVanguard Enforcer is The Depository Trust &\nClearing Corporation (DTCC), the largest\n\nfinancial services post-trade infrastructure\norganization in the world. Headquartered in\nNew York, New York, with operating facilities\nthroughout the United States and overseas,\nDTCC has become \xe2\x80\x9cfar more proactive\xe2\x80\x9d in\nsecurity measures with the use of the\nVanguard Enforcer, according Paul de Graaff,\nthe company\xe2\x80\x99s corporate information security\nofficer and vice president. de Graaff also\nnotes that the Vanguard technology transcends\npaper-based reporting methods, is easy to\nmaintain and track, and helps keep overall\nsurveillance \xe2\x80\x9cclean.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x9d\x96\n\nCOMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFFS\n\nAfter a decade of successful implementation\nat Johnson and other NASA facilities, the\nAgency approached Vanguard to assume all\nproduct development, support, and commercialization of the Enforcer technology. In August of\n1999, NASA granted Vanguard exclusive rights\nto commercialize the Enforcer system for the\nprivate sector. In return, Vanguard continues to\nsupply NASA with ongoing research, development, and support of Enforcer.\nThe Vanguard Enforcer 4.2 is one of several\nsurveillance technologies that make up the\nVanguard Security Solutions\xe2\x84\xa2 line of products.\nUsing a mainframe environment, Enforcer 4.2\nachieves previously unattainable levels of automated security management. It offers protection\n24 hours a day, 7 days a week, while maintaining standards, policies, and operating system\nsettings (such settings are continuously\nbenchmarked against policy baselines and best\npractice security standards).\nEnforcer 4.2 automatically sends notification\nof discrepancies or violations to individuals\nresponsible for system oversight. Enforcer\nsupports all Simple Mail Transfer Protocolcompatible e-mail systems, and will permit\nmultiple recipients per notice. Once a discrepancy or violation is detected, the system will\nprovide the option to automatically generate\nand execute the necessary commands to return\nthe system security to the level defined in the\nbaselines generated by the user.\nAccording to Ronn Bailey, studies over the\npast 20 years have demonstrated that as much\nas 70 percent of actual information system\nlosses have been the result of authorized users,\nthe majority of which caused by human error,\nand some by malicious intent.\nMoving forward, Bailey notes that there is a\nmajor commercial focus on protecting the\nInternet and networks with layers of firewalls\n(systems that enforce access control between two\nnetworks) and network intrusion detection.\nHowever, he adds that since the bulk of\nintrusions are tied to authorized, inside users\naccessing the computers that host critical\ninformation and transactions, the erroneous or\nmalicious acts of these individuals fall out of\nthe reach of firewalls and network intrusion\ndetection. This theory applies to vital corporate,\nstate, national, government, and military information that is stored and maintained on\n\nRonn Bailey, Vanguard\nIntegrity Professionals\xe2\x80\x99\nchief executive officer and\nchief technology officer\n(left foreground), confers\nwith a client during an\nattempted security breach.\nThe Vanguard\nEnforcer\xe2\x84\xa2 software\nintercepts the attempted\nhack on the system, which\nis displayed on the\nmonitors in the control\nroom of the server farm.\n\nVanguard Enforcer\xe2\x84\xa2 and Vanguard Security Solutions\xe2\x84\xa2 are\ntrademarks of Vanguard Integrity Professionals.\n\nCOMPUTER TECHNOLOGY\n\n135\n\n'
