Reece Roth\nLewis Research Center\n\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\n\nInvited lecture for a course on controlled fusion sponsored\n\nby the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society\nAustin, Texas, May 26-28, 1976\n\nCM\n\nG\n\nr~\xc2\xb0\n\nol\n\n%C0\nI.,>\nV\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe scope of this lecture is restricted to magnetic confinement concepts\n\n\nwhich may provide back-up or second- generation alternatives for the\n\n\nTokamak fusion reactor,-and which have been reduced to practice in the\n\n\nform of operating experimental apparatus.\n\nThe Tokamak concept has been\n\n\n\ncovered in previous lectures. \'The principal alternatives to Tokamak,\n\n\ntheta pinches, open-ended geometries, and their modifications, will\n\n\nbe covered in other lectures in this series.\n\nInertial confinement schemes\n\n\n\nbased on fusion microbombs which are ignited by irradiating fuel pellets\n\n\nwith lasers or relativistic particle beams will also be covered in other\n\n\nlectures, as will the laser light pipe concept.\n \n\nThe purpose of this lecture is to describe alternative plasma con\xc2\xad\n\nfinement schemes in such a way that the basic principles of each device\n \n\ncan be understood and associated with its name, Desirable characteristics\n\n\nof an advanced fusion reactor will be presented, and the present Tokamak\n\n\nreactor conceptual designs will be examined in light of these criteria.\n\n\nFusion reactions occur only at kinetic temperatures measured in\n\n\ntens of millions of degrees Kelvin.\n\nThere are two recognized ways in\n\n\n\nwhich fusion reactions can be confined in the steady state, each employing\n\n\na different field of force for confinement.\nthe use of gravitational fields.\n\nThe first possibility is\n\n\n\nThis is known to work, because the\n\n\n\nsun and all the stars derive their energy from fusion reactions in their\n\n\ncores.\n\nThis approach is infeasible in the laboratory because one must\n\n\n\nassemble in one place an amount of hyd\'rogen somewhat larger than the\n\n\nplanet Jupiter in order to ignite fusion reactions0\n\nThe second method\n\n\n\ninvolves confinement of the energetic thermonuclear plasma by magnetic\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\nfields.\n\nThis method is utilized in all of the concepts which will be\n\n\n\ndiscussed in this lecture.\n\n\nWhen the energetic ions which form the fusionable fuel of a fusion\n\n\nreactor are confined in a strong uniform magnetic field, their trajec\xc2\xad\n\ntories are helices, as illustrated on the bottom of figure 1. When\n\n\nlooked at along the magnetic field lines, the projected trajectories\n\n\nare circles with a characteristic radius of gyration which depends on\n\n\nthe particle energy and the magnetic field strength.\n\nThe particles\n\n\n\nare trapped on these magnetic field lines as long as they suffer no\n\n\ncollisions.\n\nWhen collisions occur, the particles perform a slow random\n\n\n\nwalk toward the walls of the containment vessel, with a step size equal\n\n\nto the particle gyroradius.\nto as classical diffusion.\n\nThis particle transport process is referred\n\n\nFusion reactor design studies have shown\n\n\n\nthat if plasma diffuses across a magnetic field no faster than the clas\xc2\xad\n\nsical rate, a net power producing fusion reactor is feasible.\n\n\nThe limit to pure magnetic confinement imposed by classical dif\xc2\xad\n\nfusion is an important determining factor for the break-even power out\xc2\xad\n\nput of a fusion reactor.\n\nIf it were possible to reduce the radial dif\xc2\xad\n\n\nfusion of plasma to values slower than that predicted by classical dif\xc2\xad\n\nfusion, the break-even power output of fusion reactors might become on\n\n\nthe order of a few megawatts, small enough to be used on mobile vehicles.\n\n\nOne possibility for improving steady-staj6 plasma confinement beyond\n\n\nthe classical limit is the simultaneous use of both electric and magnetic\n\n\nfields.\n\nIn this approach, the already adequate confinement properties\n\n\n\nof a suitable magnetic field might be enhanced further by the judicious\n\n\napplication of a strong electric field to the plasma,\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nProgress made in the magnetic containment of plasmas in toroidal\n\n\ndevices is indicated on figure 2; which was\'taken from the report by\n\n\nEastland and Goughi (WASH\'1132).\n\nThe containment time appropriate to\n\n\n\nclassical diffusion is indicated on the ordinate, as is the containment\n\n\ntime required for an economically attractive fusion reactor (indicated\n\n\nby the heavy black bar).\n\nWhen fusion research started in 1952, the\n\n\n\nplasmas were immediately lost to the wail.\n\nAfter a few years of research,\n\n\n\nthe confinement time reached the so-called "anomalous" or Bohm value.\n\n\nThe confinement times remained constant at the Bohm value for nearly\n\n\n10 years.\n\nIt was not until 1965 that the Russians, with their Tokamak\n\n\n\ndevice, first reported confinement times significantly greater than the\n\n\nBohm Value.\n\nAfter this, progress in toroidal plasma confinement was\n \n\n\nrelatively rapid.\n\nBy 1970, several experiments reached and exceeded\n\n\n\nthe value required for an economically attractive fusion reactor.\n\nThis\n\n\n\nbreakthrough in plasma confinement is responsible for the current phase\n\n\nof optimism in controlled fusion research,\n\n\nPlasma confinement time is not the only measure of progress in fusion\n\n\nresearch, as you heard in previous lectures.\n\nOn figure 3 is shown the\n\n\n\nLawson diagram, which plots the ion energy on the ordinate and the product\n \n\nof density and containment time on the abscissa.\n\nThe regions appropriate\n\n\n\nto prototype fusion reactors and fusion power plants are indicated very\n\n\nschematically by the cross-hatched regions in the upper right.\n\nThere\n\n\n\nhas been steady progress-toward the fusion reactor regime, with the\n\n\nAlcator experiment at MIT, a Tokamak device, currently in the lead.\n\n\nAll the devices closest to the fusion reactor regime are Tokamaks, with\n\n\nthe exception of the theta pinches under investigation at Los Alamos.\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nThe success of the Tokamak reactor in achieving high ion kinetic tem\xc2\xad\n\n\'peratures, confinement times, and number densities has made it the concept\n\n\nof choice in all major industrial countries which are pursuing fusion\n\n\nresearch.\n\nIt is the current consensus that, unless unforeseen diffi\xc2\xad\n\n\nculties arise, the first demonstration fusion power plants wi-I\n\nbe DT\n\n\n\nTokamak devices.\n\n\nDESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF A FUSION REACTOR\n\n\nThe characteristics of an ideal fusion reactor depend upon the\n\n\nultimate application.\n\nA fusion reactor intended for the electric\n\n\n\nutilities will not necessarily be suitable for space or military appli\xc2\xad\n\ncations or for commercial applications other than electrical power gen\xc2\xad\n\neration.\n\nThe utilities desire a reactor which has minimum capital costs\n\n\n\nand cost of electricity, minimal environmental intrusion, and high re\xc2\xad\n\nliability and availability.\n\nSpace applications require a minimum total\n\n\n\nmass for a given power output, high reliability and ease of repair,\n\n\nand a fuel cycle which releases most of its energy in charged particles,\n\n\nwhich can be used for the exhaust jet of a rocket.\n\nMilitary applications\n\n\n\nrequire mobility, reliability, and invulnerability.\n\n\nIn order to provide criteria by which fusion reactor concepts can\n\n\nbe judged, it is useful to specify characteristics which a fusion reactor\n\n\nshould have.\n\nSuch a list is given in Table 1.\n\n\nTABLE I\n\n\nDesirable Characteristics of a Fusion Reactor\n\n\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\nG.\nH.\nI.\n\nSteady-State Operation\n\n\nHigh Beta\n\n\nSelf-Sustaining Fusion Reaction\n\n\nAdvanced Fuel Cycles Possible\n \n\nDirect Conversion to Electrical Power\n\n\nSmall Size and Power Output\n \n\nNo Neutrons or Activation of Structure\n\n\nEnvironmentally Safe\n\n\nHigh Capital and Resource Productivity\n\n\n\n4\n\nNot all of these characteristics are necessarily desirable for all\n\n\npossible applications of fusim\n\nreactors, but they do imply increased\n\n\n\nattractiveness of fusion power for at least one of the possible areas\n\n\nof application.\n\n\nIn the first place,-a fusion reactor should operate in the steady\n\n\nstate.\n\nPower interruptions associated with cyclic operation are awkward\n\n\n\nfor the utilities if the interruptions are comparable with the thermal\n\n\ntime constant of the plant.\n\nMany of the pulsed or inertially confined\n\n\n\nconcepts suffer a disadvantage because it is more difficult to extract\n\n\nenergy with high efficiency when it is released in a pulsed manner.\n\n\nPulsed fusion reactors also suffer the disadvantage that they must be\n\n\ndesigned to bear the maximum thermal and mechanical stresses, rather\n\n\nthan designing to the average values appropriate to a steady-state re\xc2\xad\n\nactor.\n\n\nIt is generally believed that the magnet cost for a fusion reactor\n\n\nwill be minimized if the reactor operates at a high value of beta, the\n\n\nratio of plaima to magnetic energy density.\n\nHigh values of beta imply\n\n\n\nsmaller reactor sizes, lower capital investment in the magnetic field,\n\n\ncontainment structure, and blanket, and less synchrotron radiation for\n\n\na favorable energy balance.\n\n\nIt is desirable that a fusion reactor be capable of a completely\n\n\nor nearly self-sustaining fusion reaction in which the energy released\n\n\nin charged particles is used to heat the incoming fuel in the plasma\n\n\nitself, rather than with large or expensive external equipment prior\n\n\nto injection.\n\n\nA fusion reactor should be capable of operating with advanced fuel\n\n\ncycles, other than the DT reaction, since such fuel cycles release more\n\n\nof their energy in the form of charged particles.\n\n5\n\n\n\nSome advanced fuel\n\n\n\ncycles (the proton-boron-li reaction for example) are capable of oper\xc2\xad\n\nating without producing energetic neutrons.\n\nThe DD reaction has cross\n\n\n\nsections second highest only to the DT reaction and uses a plentiful fuel\n\n\nwhich is aval-lable without breeding.\n\n\nAdvanced fuel cycle reactors which release their energy in the form\n\n\nof charged particles should be capable of operating in such a way that\n\n\nthe energetic charged particles, which would otherwise diffuse to the\n\n\nwalls of the containment vessel, can be scavenged and converted to elec\xc2\xad\n\ntrical power by one of several direct conversion schemes.\n\n\nFor some applications, it would be desirable if a self-sustaining,\n\n\nfusion reactor were of small enough size and power output that it could\n\n\noperate as a mobile power source.\n \n\nAny fusion reactor must be environmentally safe, and one means\n\n\nof minimizing possible radiation hazards is to use one of the advanced\n\n\nfuel cycles which either do not generate neutrons or at least minimize\n\n\nthe neutron generation and/or activation of the reactor structure.\n\n\nMany of these desirable characteristics of a fusion reactor are\n\n\nmotivated by the criterion that a fusion power plant have the highest\n\n\npossible captial and resource productivity.\n\nIt is becoming clear that\n\n\n\nboth capital and natural resources are the principal limits on economic\n\n\ngrowth.\n\nDesign studies have shown that fusion power plants based on the\n\n\n\nTokamak concept may be just competitive, in terms of cost of electricity,\n\n\nwith fission power plants (ref. 1).\n\nSuch power plants would provide the\n\n\n\nworld with electricity using a very plentiful natural resource.\n\nHowever,\n\n\n\nin a world experiencing increasing shortages, it would be desirable if\n\n\nless capital and natural resources were required to construct these plants.\n\n\n\n6\n\nIt appears that only by exploiting fusion reactor concepts more advanced\n\n\nthan those described in ref. 1 can one reverse the trend of declining\n\n\ncapital and resource productivity.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE TOKAMAK CONCEPT\n\n\nWhen measured against the criteria just discussed, the present\n\n\nTokamak fusion reactor conceptual designs are seen to have limitations\n \n\nin several areas.\n\nThese are listed in Table I1.\n\n\nTABLE I1\n\n\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE PRESENT TOKAMAK CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS\n\n\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\n\nMust Operate in Cyclic Manner\n\n\nLow Beta Required for Stability\n\n\nAdvanced Fuel-Cycles Appear Infeasible\n\n\nFusion Reactions may not be Self-Sustaining\n\n\nCapital and Resource Productivity No Better than Fission Reactors\n\n\nMassive, Stationary Power Plant\n\n\nThe Tokamak concept cannot operate in the steady state, because\n\n\n\nthe plasma currents in the toroidal direction serve a double function;\n\n\nthey not only create and heat the plasma by ohmic heating, but these\n\n\ncurrents also generate the pooidal magnetic field which confines the\n\n\nplasma.\n\nWhen this plasma current decays below a certain threshold,\n\n\n\nconfinement is lost and the plasma must be restarted in a cyclic manner,\'\n\n\nVarious design studies estimate that a Tokamak fusion reactor might\n\n\nburn for a few minutes to one hour, and that one or a few minutes might\n\n\nbe required to purge the confinement volume and restart the plasma.\n \n\nIf the down time required for purging and restart is comparable to the\n\n\nsteam plant time constant, the cyclic power production could be very\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nundesirable for utility applidations.\nAt present, it appears that stability considerations will limit\nTokamak fusion reactors to a low value of beta, on the order of 5%.\nBecause of these low values of beta, it appears difficult to operate\nTokamak reactors with advanced fuel cycles.\n\nThese generally require\n\nhigher kinetic temperatures,and a constant, low value of beta would\nrequire much larger volumes or stronger magnetic fields to generate\nthe same total power output.\n\nIf the ion and electron temperatures of\n\nthe plasma are equal, the magnetic field required to confine plasmas\nusing advanced fuels at low beta would imply amounts of synchrotron\nradiation sufficient to quench the reaction.\n\nThe limitation to low\n\nbeta may restrict Tokamak reactors to the DT reaction.\n\nThe current\n\nstate of understanding is probably not sufficiently advanced to state\nwhether\'or not a Tokamak DT reactor would be self-sustaining as a result\nof the slowing down of alpha particles in the plasma; if significant\namounts of external heating of the fuel were necessary, as by energetic\nneutral injection, this would represent a substantial burden of capital\nequipment necessary to recycle the power (ref, 1),\nPRINCIPALALTERNATIVES TO TOKAHAK\n \n\nAt present, ERDA\'is concentrating its developmental effort on the\n\n\nTokamak concept.\n\nIt is hoped to have a scientific feasibility demonstration\n\n\n\nby the early 1980\'s and a demonstration fusion power plant by 1995.\n\n\nShould unforeseen difficulties cause the Tokamak concept to falter,\n\n\nthere are a number of alternatives in the U.S. program.\n\n8\n\nExcept for the\n\n\n\nlaser fusion effort, these are being funded at levels about 1/10 to 1/100\n\n\nthat of the Tokamak effort.\n\nThe two alternative approaches receiving\n\n\n\nthe highest funding (Scyllac theta pinch and the mirror machines) date\n\n\nback to the origins of fusion research in the early 1950\'s (ref. 2).\n\n\nThe Scyllac @-pinch is under investigation at Los Alamos.\n\nThis\n\n\n\napproach initially utilized linear S pinches consisting of an evacuated\n\n\nconfinement volume surrounded by a single turn coil\nenergized by capacitor banks.\n\nand this coil was\n\n\n\nThis approach was the first to produce\n\n\n\nplasmas of densities and temperatures sufficiently high to yield thermo\xc2\xad\n\nnuclear neutrons, in 1958.\n\nBy the mid-1960\'s, it became evident that\n\n\n\nend losses from linear theta pinches were large.\n\nTo make further sig\xc2\xad\n\n\nnificant progress on the Lawson diagram, the theta pinch was modified\n\n\ninto a toroidal geometry called Scyllac.\n\nA photograph of a 1200 sector\n\n\n\nof the toroidal Scyllac facility is shown on figure 5. The evacuated\n\n\nchamber which contains the plasma is located in the circular sector\n\n\nnear the technician on the right center of the photograph.\nbanks are to-the left.\n\nThe capacitor\n\n\n\nFigure 6 shows data taken in a linear e-pinch\n\n\n\nat Los Alamos (private communication) in which the dark fringes represent\n\n\nisodensity contours of the plasma.\n\nThe uniformity of these contours\n\n\n\nillustrates the stable, quiescent containment of the compressed plasma.\n\n\nThe mirror alternative is being studied at the Lawrence Livermore\n\n\nLaboratory via attempts to confine a plasma in a minimum-B open-ended\n\n\ngeometry, and at the NASA Lewis Research Center in DC heating experi\xc2\xad\n\nments in a simple high field strength superconducting magnetic mirror\n\n\ncalled the SUMMA facility.\n\nThe early work on the mirror approach to\n\n\n\n9\n\ncontrolled fusion also dates from the early 1950\'s (ref. 2).\n\nAt present,\n\n\n\nthere are two major open-ended-experiments at the Livermore Laboratory;\n\n\nthe 2xll device and the Baseball experiment.\n\nMore will be said about\n \n\n\nthe 2xll experiment in other lectures in this series.\n\nA photograph\n\n\n\nof the Baseball machine is shown on figure 7. The Baseball machine\n\n\nis so-called because the magnetic field windings are in the form of\n\n\na baseball seam with a major diameter of approximately one meter.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nwindings shown in figure 7 are superconducting and produce a minimum\n\n\nB region of containment near the center of the windings.\n\nThe magnetic\n\n\n\nfield lines are not closed on themselves in the confinement volume and\n\n\nspread out in two fan-shaped loss regions from opposite lobes of the\n\n\nbaseball,\n\nOn figure 8 is shown a photograph of the dewar in which the\n\n\n\nbaseball windings are located.\n\nThis dewar is slightly to the left of\n\n\n\ncenter of the photograph with a liquid helium refrigerator located to\n\n\nthe right.\n\nThis facility and NASA\'s SUMMA facility are presently the\n\n\n\ntwo largest superconducting fusion facilities in the world,\n\n\nOver the past 10 years, both the 8-pinch and open-ended approaches\n\n\nhave made incremental advances in achieving higher plasma densities,\n \n\ncontainment times, and ion temperatures; but neither is as close in\n\n\nterms of/?Lt\n\nto the fusion reactor regime as the Tokamak.\n\nAs one can\n\n\n\nsee from figure 3, the best results from the 8-pinch are about a factor\n\n\n\'\nof five in/1lY \nbelow the latest Alcator results and were achieved many\n\n\n\nyears ago.\n\nThe most recent results from the 2xil experiment are more\n\n\n\nthan two orders of magnitude below the Alcator experiment in/IY-,\n\nal\xc2\xad\n\n\nthough the ion kinetic temperatures are higher by about a factor of ten.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nDesigFn studies of hypothetical fusion power plants based on the\n \n\ne-pinch or mirror machines have not been encouraging.\n\nThe basic dif\xc2\xad\n\n\nficulty with both concepts is that\'a relatively large amount of recir\xc2\xad\n\nculating power will be required, since there appears to be no way that\n\n\nthe fusion reaction in such devices could be self-sustaining.\n\nThe 8\xc2\xad\n\n\npinch concept requires that the energy necessary to compress the plasma\n\n\nbe recovered and stored between the compression pulses (ref. 3).\n\nIn\n\n\n\npresent experiments, this energy storage is provided by a capacitor\n\n\nbank, and no attempt is made to recover the magnetic energy.\n\nCapacitors\n\n\n\nare too unreliable and too expensive to be used in a 8-pinch reactor,\n \n\nand almost the only alternative for energy storage is superconducting\n\n\nmagnets.\n\nThe capital investment required for energy storage in super\xc2\xad\n\n\nconducting magnetic fields is as great or greater than that required\n\n\nfor the magnetic field coils in a Tokamak reactor (see ref. 3,for example).\n\n\nThe open-ended geometries are burdened by particle losses so high\n\n\nthat, in order to produce net power, such a reactor must be capable of\n\n\nextracting energy from the charged particle efflux with high efficiency,\n\n\nand then reconverting this energy into energetic particles in the plasma.\n\n\nThis recirculating power may typically be greater than the net power\n\n\noutput of the plant.\n\nIn a toroidal device, this recirculation of power\n\n\n\noccurs within the plasma and is represented by the transport of energetic\n\n\ncharged particles from one point of the toroidal plasma to another.\n\n\nThe open-ended geometries may have a role to play in fusion reactor\n\n\ndevelopment as power consuming fusion engineering test facilities, where\n\n\nfusion-like plasmas are generated for physics and engineering studies.\n\n\n11\n\n\n\nADVANCED FUSION REACTOR CONCEPTS USING MAGNETIC CONTAINMENT\n\n\nOver the past 5 years, it has become increasingly clear that if\n\n\none wishes to improve upon the capital and resource productivity of\n\n\nthe Tokamak reactor, one may need to exploit advanced fusion reactor\n\n\nconcepts.\n\nThe devices discussed below each appear to improve upon one\n\n\n\nor more of the limitations of the present Tokamak fusion reactor designs.\n\n\nBecause these concepts are in an early stage of investigation, all of\n\n\ntheir limitations and advantages are not well defined.\n\nTherefore it\n\n\n\nis not possible at this time to evaluate whether, if pursued, they may\n\n\nprovide viable alternatives to the Tokamak reactor.\n\nSome of the advan\xc2\xad\n\n\ntages and disadvantages of the concepts discussed below are summarized\n\n\nin Table III at the end of the text.\n\n\nTormac\n\n\nThe Tormac confinement concept has been developed by H. A. Levine\n\n\nand his colleagues (refs. 4-8).\n\nThe current-carrying conductors of the\n \n\n\nTormac concept are shown in figure 9. A current flows through the plasma\n\n\nin the toroidal direction.\n\nThe arrangement of the magnetic field differs\n\n\n\nfrom that of the Tokamak in that the plasma is confined in a toroidal\n\n\ncusp configuration with two annular cusps or vertices facing outward\n\n\naway from the major axis of the torus.\n\nThe principal motivation of this\n\n\n\ngeometry is to achieve a higher degree of macroscopic plasma stability\n\n\nthan is possible in the Tokamak by using the cusp geometry, in which\n\n\nthe magnetic field lines tend to restrain gross motions of the-plasma.\n\n\nIn principle, the Tormac should be capable of confining plasmas at values\n\n\n12\n\n\n\nof beta approaching unity, rather than the low values which are neces\xc2\xad\n\nsary for stability in the Tokamak.\n\n\nThere is some recent experimental evidence (refs. 7 and 8) that\n\n\nplasma is stably confined in the Tormac, and at higher values of beta\n\n\nthan would be possible in an equivalent Tokamak. A photograph of the\n\n\nTormac plasma is shown in figure 10.\n\nIn this particular version of\n\n\n\nthe Tormac, the magnetic field is generated by thin wires connected\n\n\nto capacitor banks so that the entire plasma volume is visible.\n\nLike\n\n\n\nthe Tokamak, the plasma contains strong toroidal currents which help\n\n\nto confine the plasma, so the Tormac is basically a cyclic plasma con\xc2\xad\n\ntainment concept.\n\nIf the Tormac could be developed to a fusion reactor,\n\n\n\nit may have the advantages and disadvantages listed in column 1 of Table\n\n\nIll.\n\n\nTopolotron\n\n\nThe Topolotron concept has been developed by R. W. Bass, J. H.\n\n\nGardner, et al. (refs. 9-11) at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah,\n\n\nThe basic Topolotron configuration is shown in figure 11, and arose\n\n\nfrom highly abstract considerations relating to the topological prop\xc2\xad\n\nerties of tor6idal magnetic field configurations.\n\nThe Topolotron ex\xc2\xad\n\n\nhibits a property known as topological stability, which may also imply\n\n\nimproved stability and confinement of a high beta toroidal plasma.\n\n\nA comparison of the current-carrying conductors of the Tormac and the\n\n\nTopolotron in figures 9 and 11 shows that they are basically an inside\xc2\xad\n\nout version of each other, with the two annular cusp-like vertices pointing\n\n\nradially inward in the Topolotron and outward in the Tormac.\n13\n\n\n\nIn the\n\n\n\nTopolotron, the currents flowing in the plasma are in the poloidal direc\xc2\xad\n\ntion, like the theta pinch, while they flow in the toroidal direction\n\n\nin the Tormac.\n\n\nThe Topolotron has a further interesting property illustrated in\n\n\nfigure 12.\n\nThe magnetic field lines on the plasma surface are indicated\n\n\n\nby the arrows in this figure, and they tend to reach limit cycles at the\n\n\ntwo cusp-like points on the inner circumference of the plasma volume.\n\n\nWhether this fimit cycle behavior also implies an undesirable piling\n\n\nup of particles at the two cusp points remains to be seen.\n\nA projec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntion of the poloidal component of the magnetic field is shown in figure\n\n\n13.\n\nOn figure 14 is shown a photograph of the Topolotron apparatus\n\n\n\nin a partially assembled state.\n\nit is hoped to perform experiments on\n\n\n\nthe Topolotron in mid or late 1976.\n\nIf the TopoTotron concept could\n\n\n\nbe scaled up to a fusion reactor, its advantages and disadvantages rela\xc2\xad\n\ntive to the Tokamak would be similar to those of the Tormac and are listed\n\n\nin column 2 of Table III.\n\n\nStellarator\n\n\nThe Stellarator concept was originated in the U.S. at Princeton\n\n\nin 1952 (ref. 2), but has fallen into relative neglect in the United\n\n\nStates since about 1969.\n\n=\n\nIn order to appreciate the merits of the stel\n \n\n\nlarator concept, it is helpful to understand why a simple toroidal mag\xc2\xad\n\nnetic field is not adequate to confine a plasma,\n\nIn figure 15 is shown\n\n\n\na simple torus with magnetic field windings around the toroidal volume.\n\n\nBecause of the effect of toroidal curvature, the current-carrying conductors\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\nare more closely bunched on the inside circumference of the windings\n\n\nthan they are on the outside circumference.\n\nThis leads to a stronger\n\n\n\nmagnetic field along the inside radius of the plasma than along the\n\n\noutside radius, and the resulting gradient of magnetic field along the\n\n\nmajor radius of the torus causes particles of opposite sign to drift\n\n\nto the top or bottom of the torus.\n\nThis charge separation leads to\n\n\n\nelectric fields which cause the toroidal plasma to be lost to the walls.\n\n\nIn order to overcome this bunching of the magnetic field lines along\n\n\nthe inside circumference, one can twist the torus into a figure eight\n\n\npattern like that shown in figure 16.\n\nThis will assure that all of the\n\n\n\nmagnetic field lines have approximately equal length, and the effects\n\n\nof the particle drifts will cancel as the particles traverse a complete\n\n\ncircuit of the torus.\n\nThis figure eight geometry is awkward to implement\n\n\n\nin an actual experiment, so the same effect is achieved by a combina\xc2\xad\n\ntion of current-carrying windings illustrated on figure 17.\n\nThe tightly\n\n\n\nwound helix represents the coils which produce the toroidal magnetic\n \n\nfield.\n\nInside the toroidal field coils are loosely wound helical windings.\n\n\n\nThe currents in adjacent pairs of the helicalhwindings flow in opposite\n\n\ndirections, and the net effect is a magnetic field in which the field\n\n\nlines rotate about the minor axis of the confinement volume by an amount\n\n\nproportional to the radius.\ncorner of figure 17.\n\nThis is illustrated in the lower-right-hand\n\n\n\nThe magnetic field lines along the pldsma column\n \n\n\nrotate around the axis far more on the outside than on the inside.\n\n\nThe rotation of the magnetic field lines about the minor axis of the\n\n\nconfinement volume is called rotational transform, and the differing\n\n\namounts of rotational transform as one moves along the radius is referred\n\n\nto as magnetic shear.\n\n\n15\n\n\n\nThe behavior of the magnetic field lines in a stellarator geometry\n\n\nis illustrated in figures 18 and 1\'9, two views of a L = 3 stellarator,\n\n\nin which six helical windings containing three pairs of oppositely flowing\n\n\ncurrents are on the oftside; and the magnetic fleld lines with their\n\n\nshear and varying degrees of rotational transform are in the plasma\n\n\nvolume.\n\n\nA plot of the magnetic field strength contours and the particle\n\n\ndrift surfaces are shown in figure 20 for an L = 3 stellarator such\n\n\nas the one Proto-Cleo device at the University of Wisconsin (ref. 12).\n\n\nOn figure 21 is shown an experimental determination of the drift sur\xc2\xad\n\nfaces of an L = 3 stellarator in which a small electron gun was placed\n \n\nat various radii in a stellarator geometry, and multiple exposures of\n\n\nthe electron i=pacts on a fluorescent screen were made as the electron\n\n\ngun was moved along equal increments in the radius.\n\n\nA schematic diagram of one of the early stellarator experiments\n\n\nat Princeton University is shown on figure 22,\n\nThese stellarators were\n\n\n\nbuilt in a racetrack configuration in which only the curved end portions\n\n\nhad a helical winding.\n\nThe toroidal coils, the helical stellarator\n\n\n\nwindings, the ohmic heating coils, ,the divertor, and two straight sec\xc2\xad\n\ntions of magnetic field are indicated.\n\nOn figure 23 is a photograph\n\n\n\nof one of the early stellarators, which is about I meter by 2 meters\n\n\nlong in a racetrack configuration.\n\nOutside the U.S., there currently\n\n\n\nare active stellarator research programs in Russia, West Germany, England,\n\n\nFrance, and Japan.\n\nIn figure 24 is shown a photograph of the Russian\n\n\n\nL2 stellarator, which is symmetric without the straight sections used\n\n\nin the Princeton experiments.\n\nThe only stellarator experiment currently\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\nactive in the United States is the Proto-Cleo experiment at the University\n\n\nof Wisconsin which is shown in figure 25 (ref. 12),\n\n\nThe stellarator geometry has the important advantage over the Tokamak\n\n\nthat all the currents which confine the plasma are external to the plasma.\n\n\nUnlike the Tokamak, the stellarator does not require currents flowing\n\n\nin the plasma to assist in confinement.\n\nFor this reason, the steilarator\n\n\n\ncan, in principle, be operated in the steady state and does not have to\n\n\nbe operated in a 6yclic manner to re-establish the toroidalt currents.\n\n\nIn addition, the stelIarator may be capable of operating at somewhat\n\n\nhigher values of beta than the Tokamak. The potential advantages and\n\n\ndisadvantages of the Stellarator with respect to the Tokamak are listed\n\n\nin column 3 of Table III.\n\n\nTorsatron\n\n\nThe torsatron concept is under investigation by Hamberger and Sharp\n\n\n(ref. 14) at the Cuiham Laboratory in England.\n\nThe torsatron is a close\n\n\n\nrelative of the stellarator geometry, in which rotational -transform and\n\n\nshear of the magnetic field lines are achieved with a much simpler con\xc2\xad\n\nductor geometry. The torsatron conductor geometry is illustrated in\n\n\nfigure 26, which is a photograph of the torsatron windings in use at\n\n\nthe Culham Laboratory.\n\nThere are three conductors wound around the\n\n\n\ntordidal volume, each of which carries current in the same direction.\n\n\nThese helical windings serve the same function as the combination of\n\n\ntoroidal and helical windings in a stellarator, with the poloidal compo\xc2\xad\n\nnent of the current generating the toroidal magnetic field, and the\n\n\ntoroidal component of the current generating the poloidal magnetic field.\n\n\n17\n\n\n\nThis particular geometry has a sector periodicity of 30 degrees, and\n\n\nthe drift surfaces in 5 degree increments along one of these sectors\n\n\nare shown in figure 27.\n\nThe windings shown in figure 26 are contained\n\n\n\nin a large vacuum tank, a sketch of which -isshown in figure 28.\n\nA\n\n\n\nphotograph of the torsatron plasma was taken through one.of the top\n\n\nviewports of this vacuum tank and is shown in figure 29,\n\n\nAn examination of figures 26 and 29 makes obvious the basic sim\xc2\xad\n\nplicity of the torsatron magnetic field windings, and this is very sig\xc2\xad\n\nnificant from an engineering point of view.\n\nThe torsatron has a further\n\n\n\ninteresting property which, as it happens, is not exemplified by this\n\n\nparticular experiment,\n\nIn figure 26 one can see the mechanical supports\n\n\n\nwhich bear the forces between the current-carrying conductors.\n\nWith\n\n\n\nthe torsatron geometry, it is possible in principle to design the helical\n \n\nconductors in such a way that they are a force-free configuration, that\n\n\nis, no net mechanical forces will act between the individual conductors.\n\n\nThis potentially represents a saving in structural material, and also\n\n\ncan be made into a fail-safe design in which one does not have to design\n\n\nfor unbalanced magnetic forces.\n\nThe only forces which act on the conduc\xc2\xad\n\n\ntors are gravitational, and those which arise from a finite plasma beta\n\n\nrelative to the force-free vacuum field configuration.\n\nThe advantages\n \n\n\nand disadvantages of the torsatron configuration relative to the Tokamak\n \n\nare listed in column 4 of Table IMl.\n\n\nBumpy Torus\n\n\nThe pure bumpy torus is illustrated on figure 30 and consists of\n\n\na number of coils equally spaced in a toroidal array.\n\n18\n\n\n\nEach sector of\n\n\n\nthe torus consists of a magnetic mirror. The particles which are con\xc2\xad\n\nfined by this geometry are of two kinds:\n\nthose which reflect back and\n\n\n\nforth between the magnetic mirrors in an individual sector, and those\n\n\nwhich circulate around the major circumference of the toroidal plasma.\n\n\nThe magnetic field gradients along the toroidal direction result in\n\n\nparticle drift surfaces whi\'ch close on themselves for both trapped and\n\n\npassing particles.\n\nThis geometry represent an evolution of the simple\n\n\n\nmirror machine, in which several magnetic mirrors are placed end to end\n\n\nin a toroidal array to confine particles that would otherwise be lost\n\n\nthrough the mirrors.\n\n\nThe bumpy torus magnetic field configuration was first investigated\n\n\nin this country by Gibson, Jordan, and Lauer (refs. 15 and 16) and is\n\n\ncurrently being pursued at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (refs.\n\n\n17 and 18).\n\nIn th\'e Elmo Bumpy Torus experiment at Oak Ridge, relativistic\n\n\n\nelectrons are gen&rated with microwaves and are trapped near the midplane\n\n\nof each-sector to the extent that beta values exceeding .5 have been\n\n\nmeasured in steady-state operation.\n\nThis provides encouraging experi\xc2\xad\n\n\nmental evidence that high beta plasmas can be confined in the bumpy torus\n\n\nconfiguration, at least when circulating relativistic electron currents\n\n\nare present.\n\nThe geometry of the magnetic field windings is modular\n\n\n\nand extremely simple in the bumpy torus, \'implying an engineering advan\xc2\xad\n\ntage for this concept.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of the bumpy\n\n\n\ntorus relative to Tokamak are listed in column 5 of Table III.\n\n\nBumpy Torus with Electric Field\n\n\nThe bumpy torus approach under infestigation at the NASA Lewis\n\n\nResearch Center (refs. 19-26) is characterized by three factors:\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n1) the magnetic field and the plasma heating mechanism are operated\n\n\nin the steady state.\n\n2) strong magnetic and electric fields are applied\n\n\n\nto the plasma, and 3) the ion kinetic temperatures are typically more\n\n\nthan a factor of 10 higher than the electron temperatures in this plasma.\n\n\nAn isometric cutaway drawing of the NASA Lewis B6mpy Torus is shown\n\n\nin figure 31.\n\nThe 12 superconducting magnets are shown.\n\ncan generate up to 30 kilogauss at its throat.\n\nEach magnet\n\n\n\nThe entire torus of\n\n\n\nplasma is raised to high potentials by electrode rings which surround\n\n\nthe plasma at the-midplanes between the magnetic field coils.\nshows a photograph of the Bumpy Torus plasma.\n\nFigure 32\n\n\n\nThe vertical element\n\n\n\nat the center is a midplane electrode ring, which is typically operated\n\n\nat tens of kilovolts.\n\nThe high potentials result in strong, radial elec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntric fields between the plasma and the grounded magnet dewars.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nstrong crossed electric and magnetic fields in the plasma volume cause\n\n\ndrifts of ions and electrons which heat the-ions to kinetic\'temperatures\n\n\nof kilovolts.\n\n\nOne interesting consequence of the application of strong external\n\n\nelectric fields is-that the radial transport of charged particles is\n\n\nnot given by the conventional "classical" or "Bohm" diffusion relation\xc2\xad\n\nships.\n\nOn figure 33 is data showing the average particle residence\n\n\n\ntime as a function of magnetic field.\n\nThe residence time is virtually\n\n\n\nindependent of magnetic field over a factor of 10 variation in B. This\n\n\nindependence of magnetic field would be very surprising if the plasma\n\n\nwere confined by pure magnetic fields, since Bohm or classical confine\xc2\xad\n\nment predict confinement times which vary as B or B2 , respectively.\n\n\n20\n\n\n\nThe possible advantages and disadvantages of the electric field bumpy\n\n\ntorus are shown on column 6 of Table Ill.\n\n\nAstron and Reverse Field Devices\n\n\nThe astron concept was first proposed in the mid-1950\'s (ref. 2, 27)\n\n\nand consisted of a geometry similar to that shown in figure 34.\nsolenoidal magnetic field is set up in the steady state.\n\nA long,\n\n\n\nRelativistic\n\n\n\nelectrons or ions are iijected into this magnetic field and their energies\n\n\nage adjusted so their gyrodiameters are comparable to the diameter of\n\n\nthe intended plasma confinement region.\n\nThe relativistic particles\n\n\n\nare caused to build up to such a point that the diamagnetic field gen\xc2\xad\n\nerated by their motion exceeds that of the applied magnetic field.\n\n\nAt this point, the magnetic field will reverse inside the layer of gy\xc2\xad\n\nrating relativistic particles, and closed magnetic field lines will\n\n\nencircle the ring of gyrating particles.\n\nThis layer is referred to\n\n\n\nas an e-layer or p-layer, depending on whether relativistic electrons\n\n\nor protons are used.\n\nThe original Astron experiment was terminated\n\n\n\nin 1973 without having built up its relativistic e-layer to more than\n\n\nabout 15% of magnetic field reversal.\n\nSubsequent experiments by\'Fleischmann\n\n\n\nand others at Cornell University (ref. 28) have injected relativistic\n\n\nelectrons into a pulsed mirror magnetic field and achieved a field re\xc2\xad\n\nversal in this geometry.\n\nThe essence of their approach is indicated\n\n\n\non figure 35, and a photograph of their experiment is shown in figure\n\n\n36.\n\nThis same group has also proposed to use energetic \'protons to create\n\n\n\nfield reversal\n\nrefs. 29 and 30), and a schematic reactor concept based\n\n\n\non ion rings is illustrated in figure 37.\n\n\n21\n\n\n\nRecent results from the 2xll experiment at Livermore indicate that\n\n\nthe plasma in this device may also be producing a reverse-field configura\xc2\xad\n\ntion, with very low magnetic fields on the plasma axis, or possibly even\n\n\nfield reversal.\n\nOnce magnetic field reversal is achieved, it is hoped\n\n\n\nthat the closed magnetic field lines will provide a plasma containment\n\n\nmechanism.\n\nNone of the reverse-field experiments operated so far have\n\n\n\nbeen steady state, but in principle they could be made so.\n\n\nThe principal drawbacks of this approach are that cyclotron radia\xc2\xad\n\ntion from relativistic electrons severely limits the plasma energy den\xc2\xad\n\nsity which can be confined by an e-layer device, and this has motivated\n\n\nproposals for using proton rings in the reverse-field configuration.\n \n\nAdditionally, one not only must assure the stability of the e-layer or\n\n\np-layer.\n\nThe external equipment required to generate the e-layer or p\xc2\xad\n\n\nlayer may not be required in magnetic compression experiments similar\n\n\nto the 2x1l, but one pays a penalty by not being able to run the device\n \n\nin the steady state. The advantages and disadvantages of the reverse\xc2\xad\n\nfield devices with respect to the Tokamak are listed in column 7 of\n\n\nTable Ill.\n\n\nThe Migma Concept\n\n\nThe migma concept for controlled fusi\'on represents a combination\n\n\nof two approaches:\n\nthe colliding beam storage ring concept from high\n\n\n\nenergy nuclear physics, and the energetic neutral injection concept\n\n\nfrom mirror machine research,\n\nThis concept has been conceived and pro\xc2\xad\n\n\nmoted by B. C. Maglich and his coworkers (refs. 31-33).\n22\n\n\n\nThe essence\n\n\n\nof this concept is illustrated on figure 38.\n\nEnergetic neutrals are\n\n\n\ninjected into a magnetic field and ionized in such a way that they gy\xc2\xad\n\nrate in circles shown in figure A. These gyrating particles can be made\n\n\nto precess about the magnetic axis as Is illustrated in figure B. Once\n\n\na large number of particles are accumulated and gyrating around the mag\xc2\xad\n\nnetic axis, the situation illustrated in figures C and D will result.\n \n\nMany of the particle orbits which intersect the axis will result in\n\n\nhead-on collisions between individual charged particles and these can\n\n\nproduce a large number of fusion reactions in a small volume near the\n\n\nmagnetic axis, as illustrated in figure D. MeV particle energies are\n\n\nrequired in order to make the fusion cross section large compared to\n\n\nthe elastic scattering cross section.\n\nMore complicated orbits are pos\xc2\xad\n\n\nsible as is illustrated in figure 39, in which particles can be made\n \n\nto gyrate and drift in such a way that the intersection of their orbits\n\n\noccurs in several locations in the plasma volume,\n\nOn figure 40 is shown\n\n\n\na photograph of the chamber of the current migma experiment in which\n\n\nthe particles are injected and trapped in the gyrating orbits.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nsuperconducting magnets which produce the uniform field along the axis\n\n\nof this device is shown in figure 41.\n\n\nIf the Migma concept works as is intended, fusion reactions will\n\n\noccur in a relatively small volume, where the colliding drbits are con\xc2\xad\n\ncentrated, and the total power output will be relatively small.\n\nIt re\xc2\xad\n\n\nmains to be shown that a plasma of sufficiently high density can build\n\n\nup without disrupting the particle orbits and preventing the formation\n\n\nof regions of intersecting orbits.\n\nIt also remains to be shown that\n\n\n\nthe Migma plasma can build up to densities higher than those achieved\n\n\n23\n\n\n\nin neutral injection experiments,,which were limited by plasma instabilities.\n \n\nIt is also clear that the Migma concept, ,like the mirror-machine reactor,\n\n\nwill require a large amount of circulating power to provide the ener\xc2\xad\n\ngetic charged particles injected into the plasma.\n\nThe generation of\n\n\n\nenergetic charged particles with more than an MeV of energy, required\n\n\nfor the Migma concept, may not be possible with high efficiency0\n\nThe\n\n\n\npotential advantages and disadvantages of the Migma concept relative\n\n\nto the Tokamak are listed in column 8 of Table III.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nIf it could be shown possible to generate electrical power with\n\n\n1/10 the amount of capital or resources of competitive approaches, there\n\n\nwould obviously be an even greater motivation to develop fusion power\n\n\nplants.\n\nSuch a situation may be possible for advanced fuel cycle plants,\n \n\n\nand the possibility has already been shown to exist in the area of space\n \n\npropulsion.\n\n\nFor manned interplanetary missions and unmanned exploration of\n\n\nthe outer planets, advanted fusion rockets may have outstanding capa\xc2\xad\n\nbilities.\n\nStudies have shown (ref. 34) that if advanced cycle fusion\n\n\n\nrockets (based on the D-He3 reaction) could be built, they may have a\n\n\nspecific mass (kilograms of power plant per kilowatt of rocket exhaust\n\n\npower ) as low as 1/10 that of fission electric rockets.\n\nDT fusion\n \n\n\nreactors, however, would not have any advantage over fission reactors\n\n\nsince either must operate with heat engine electric power cycles.\n\n\nDesign studies of electrical generating plants based on the DT\n\n\nTokamak reactor have been encouraging in that they have shown that such\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\na power plant may be feasible, but-they,have been somewhat discouraging\n\n\nin that they have indicated such power plants will not have a capital\n\n\ncost lower than existing alternative power plants.\n\nUntil the present\n\n\n\ntime, the focus of fusion research has been on whether fusion reactors\n\n\nare feasible at all.\n\nin-the~future, answering the question of feasi\xc2\xad\n\n\nbility alone will not be sufficient.\n\nThose of us in the fusion community\n\n\n\nmust not only be able to guarantee the feasibility of controlled fusion,\n\n\nbut we must be able to show that its capital and resource productivity,\n\n\nas well asits environmental acceptability, are at least as good as\n\n\n-alternative energy sources.\n\nIt is too early to state which, if any,\n\n\n\nof the advanced concepts described above will be feasible or will find\n\n\ntheir way into the mainstream of fusion research.\n\nMany of these con\xc2\xad\n\n\ncepts, however, have.one or more attributes which make them a potential\n\n\nimprovement over the Tokamak concept in terms of environmntal acceptability\n\n\nand/or capital and resource productivity.\n\nIf fusion reactors are going\n\n\n\nto be better as well as feasible, there must exist d climate in which\n\n\nthe search for improved alternative concepts is cultivated.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n\nThe author would like to thank H.
