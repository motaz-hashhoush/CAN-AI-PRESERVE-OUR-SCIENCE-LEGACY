Whether they are power generation systems, computer networks or space vehicles, whenever there are multiple interfaces, complex technologies or just demanding customers, the challenges are unique. 'Systems engineering' has evolved as a discipline in order to meet these challenges by providing a structured, top-down design and development methodology for the engineer. This paper attempts to define the general class of problems requiring the complete systems engineering treatment and to show how systems engineering can be utilized to improve customer satisfaction and profit ability. Specifically, this work will focus on a design methodology for the largest of systems, not necessarily in terms of physical size, but in terms of complexity and interconnectivity.", "title": "Systems engineering for very large systems", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930015491, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lewkowicz, Paul E."}, "organization": {"name": "Hughes Aircraft Co.", "location": "Los Angeles, CA, United States"}}, "id": "53d6bcf9bae04d6d90ebaa45586dd29f"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930015491, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930015491, "id": "8c9786d843c748f2b7a35c4f8a763125", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Readings in Systems Engineering", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930015489, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Readings in Systems Engineering", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930015491.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930015491/downloads/19930015491.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930015491/downloads/19930015491.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930015491/downloads/19930015491.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
