b'SMALL BUSINESS\nINNOVATIONS\n\n112\nINDUSTRIAL\nPRODUCTIVIN\n\nsteadily growing\nsource of aerospace\n,spinoff applications\nis the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which was established\nby Congress in 1982 with\ndual objectives: to increase\nparticipation by small\n&\nbusinesses in federal R D\nactivities, and to stimulate\nconversion o government\nf\nfunded research into\ncommercial applications.\nN S is one of 11 technolAA\nogy-generating agencies of\nthe federal government participating, each administering its own programs\nindependently under policy\nguidelines set by the Small\nBusiness Administration.\nAmong recent examples of\nsuccessful SBIR commercialization is the PER-Force handcontroller shown at right, a\nforcereflecting system that\nmanipulates robots or objects\nby "feel." Originally developed for the International\nSpace Station under a Johnson Space Center SBIR contract, the handcontroller is\nproduced by Cybernet Systems Corporation, Ann Arbor,\nMichigan. Headed by president Heidi Jacobus and her\nhusband, Dr. Charles\nJacobus, Cybernet began life\nin 1988 as a cottage industry\n\nand has grown to a work force\no 25; the company has\nf\nworked on 16 SBIR projects\nand still does most o its\nf\nbusiness with government\nagencies, but is making\ngradual inroads in the\ncommercial market.\nCybernet\'s original N S\nAA\ncontract called for develop\nment of a teleoperation\ndevice with force feedback\nthat would allow a space station astronaut to position an\nexternal robot arm. When the\narm encountered an outside\nforce, the robot control stick\nwould represent that force\nby making motors built into\nthe joystick push or pull or\ntwist to represent the reality\no the outside world. The\nf\nintent was to improve teleop\nerator performance by\nproviding the sense o feel.\nf\nIn the course of develop\ning the N S system, CyberAA\nnet found it necessary to go\nbeyond representing only\nreal forces, and to include\n\nvirtual reality representations. "Since then," says Dr.\nCharles Jacobus, who is vice\npresident and technical\ndirector, "we\'ve discovered\nthat the flexibility incorporated into the control system\nfor building virtual force\nfields has opened up a\nwhole new dimension in\nman-machine interface for\ncomplex visualization applications." The device is\nparticularly well-suited for\nteleoperator environments\nwhere direct viewing is limited, for example, in murky\nunderwater environments or\nreduced light areas such as\nunderground excavations.\nThe commercially\navailable PER-Force Handcontroller is a small, backdriveable robot handle that\nmoves in six degrees of freedom, including 3-D positions\n(x, y, z) and three attitudes\n(roll, pitch and yaw). The\noperator uses the motorized\nhandle to precisely position\n\nrobots and graphically displayed objects at a given\nlocation and tool angle.\nAmong current applications,\nit is being used for molecular\nmodeling in metallurgy applications, in satellite docking\nresearch, and in research on\nmilitary unmanned ground\nvehicles. Real and virtual\nreality forces are simulated\nby a 3-D molecular modeling\nsoftware package that calculates the interacting forces\namong attracting and\nrepelling molecules; those\nforces are represented\nthrough the robot stick.\nCybernet has used the\noriginal SBIR work as a\ndeparture point for a whole\nfamily of force reflective\ndevices in the telepresence\nand virtual reality fields, and\nhas developed and patented\na general interface architecture for integrating visual\nand tactile displays.\nAnother example of SBIR\nsuccess is the commercialization of high power diode\nlaser arrays, developed\n\nunder Langley Research Center SBIR funding, by Spire\nCorporation, Bedford, Massachusetts. Langley\'s principal\ninterest in diode laser arrays\nwas their potential for use in\nLIDAR (light detection and\nranging) devices in windshear detection and warning\nsystems. A Langley developed windshear system\nemploys an optical laser telescope to send light beams\nahead of an aircraft into a\nstorm; measurement of the\nenergy reflected back to the\ntelescope from particles in\nthe storm provides an\nindication o windshear.\nf\nThe NASA contract with\nSpire called for development\no a high power semiconducf\ntor diode laser module to\npump solid state laser rods or\nslabs. This type of module, as\na replacement for the normally used flashlamp, offers a\nnumber o advantages: highly\nf\nefficient optical pumping,\nvery small size, low drive voltage requirements, and extended operational lifetimes.\n\nSpire Corporation successfully developed the laser\narray for NASA and used the\nNASA work as a development\nbase for a commercial line o\nf\ndiode laser arrays for industrial and other uses. Above,\nDr. Joel S. Schuman investigates a high power pulsed\ndiode laser at Tufts University School of Medicine, Medford, Massachusetts. The\nlaser delivers its light\nthrough a thin fiber optic\ncable. Among applications\nare laser sclerectomy,\nan operation to reduce\nglaucoma-caused eye pressure. The products can also\nbe used in industrial cutting\nand drilling and in military\napplications. Spire Corporation\'s Dr. Kurt J. Linden,\nmanager o laser product\nf\ndevelopment, reports that\nthe high efficiency o the\nf\nproducts has brought rapidly\nincreasing demand for diode\nlaser pumps.\n\n(Continued)\n\nINDUSTRIAL\nPRODUCTlVIm\n\nSMALL BUSINESS\nINNOVATIONS\n\nINDUSTRIAL\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nLangley Research Center\nhas been engaged for more\nthan a decade in develop\nment of advanced polymers,\nused in foams, fibers, adhesives, composites and coatings for a variety of space\napplications. The Center is\namong the world leaders in\ndeveloping these chemical\ncompounds, and Langley\nsponsored advances have\ncontributed significantly to\nimproving the U.S. competitive posture in polymer\nproduction and application.\nLangley, however, is an\nR&Dorganization, so it looks\nto industry to commercialize\nthe Center-invented polymers, identify commercial\napplications in and beyond\nthe aerospace field, and\ndevelop cost effective ways\nof producing them. This is\naccomplished by partnerships with industry firms\nunder Small Business\nInnovation Research\n(SBIR) contracts.\nAn example is the collaboration of Langley with Triton\nSystems, Inc. (TSI), Chelmsford, Massachusetts. TSI is\nan innovative high technol*\ngy company specializing in\nR&Dand technology transfer\nleading to product develop\nment. The company develops\nniche products in high\nperformance polymers,\nadvanced ceramics, metal\nmatrix composites and flexible manufacturing processes.\nA major need for the International Space Station and\n\nfuture longduration space\nstructures is a polymer resistant to atomic oxygen (A/O),\nwhich exists in low Earth\norbit and causes corrosion of\nspacecraft surfaces. Langley\nresearchers invented a\npromising high performance\npolymer known as PAEBI to\nmeet that need. Under an\nSBIR contract, TSI took the\nPAEBI polymer from laboratory scale to pilot scale, identified several niche market\nopportunities, and formed a\npartnership with a leading\npolymer film processing firm.\nTSI was granted a license for\ncommercial development of\nthe PAEBI-based polymer,\nnow known as AORIMIDE5\n\n(Atomic Oxygen Resistant\nImide), and the company\nalso developed the processing techniques needed to\ncoat long runs of high\nquality continuous films\nof AORIMIDE.\nTSI subsequently received\nthree other SBIR contracts,\neach geared toward a different AOFUMIDE-based\nproduct. TSI now offers the\nproduct in four forms:\nAORIMIDE polymer in pound\nquantities for commercial\nuses; AORIMIDE free standing\nfilms for space systems and\nfor Earth use in electronics\nand electrical insulation\napplications; ultrahigh performance polymer threads\nbased on AORIMIDE chemistry for space applications;\nand AORIMIDE co-polymer\nmaterial for use as membranes in elevated temperature separation applications\n(it is in use by a major membrane manufacturer as a\nliquid separation medium).\nAbove, Triton president Ross\nHaghighat displays one of his\n\nproducts, sheet polymer\nrolled into a core; other\nproducts including powder,\nliquid, and polymer sheet,\nare shown at left below.\nAnother small business\nthat has worked effectively\nas a Langley partner is\nImitec, Inc., Schenectady,\nNew York. As the company\nname suggests, Imitec focuses its efforts on polyimides,\npolymers that can tolerate\nhigh temperatures without\ndeforming. Imitec has\nreceived several SBIR contracts to modify, characterize\nand commercialize Langleyinvented polyimides.\nImitec developed its own\nprocesses to produce the\nLangley materials, processes\nthat make possible fiber\nquality material, film quality\nmaterial and moldable material. Under a Langley SBIR\ncontract, lmitec teamed with\nBarcel Wire and Cable, Irving,\nCalifornia in a successful project involving development of\npolymer pelletizing and\nextrusion technology and its\napplication to manufacture of\ninsulated aircraft cable.\nImitec is also collaborating\nwith AlliedSignal, Hoosick\nFalls, New York on use of\nNASA polyimides in\nflexible circuitry.\nAbove, Imitec chemist\nBetty Chung is making the\nmaterial in a reactor; at right\nis a sampling of products\nmade from the material,\nincluding high temperature\ngears, polymer in sheets,\n\npolymer in bead form, and\ntemperature resistant lightweight brick or tile forms.\nImitec has installed a reactor, centrifuge, film casting\nequipment, drying ovens and\nadditional electric power to\ncontinue commercialization\nof the NASA polymers. The\ncompany has also developed\nprocesses to manufacture\nmonomers and installed a\npilot reactor to continue\ndevelopment. Imitec is s u p\nplying developmental quantities of powder or liquid poly\n(amic acid) to such customers as Lockheed Martin,\nNorthrop Grumman and ICIFiberite for aerospace composites and optics; Cytec\nIndustries, The Boeing Company and 3M Corporation for\nuse in adhesives; IBM and\nMotorola for electronic systems; Ford Motor Company\n\nM\nand Delco-Remy G for automobile applications. Imitec is\nalso working with Lockheed\nMartin and Rockwell International on using Langley\ninvented polymers in the\nNASA X-33 launch vehicle\ndevelopment program.\n\n(Continued)\naAORIMIDE is a registered trademark of\nTriton Systems, Inc.\n\nINDUSTRIAL\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nSMALL BUSINESS\nINNOVATIONS\n\n116\nINDUSTRIAL\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nNASA\'s Langley Research\nCenter was looking for a way\nto improve the process of\ninspecting aging aircraft\nwithout taking the planes\napart. They found it in a\nnovel concept - originated\nby Richard Albert (right) and\ndeveloped by his company,\nDigirav Corporation, San\nRamon, California - called\nreverse geometry x-radiography (RGX)@. employs a\nRGX\ncombination of television-like\nscanning and digital data\nacquisition to produce realtime x-rays with film quality.\nSince the discovery of\nx-rays in 1895, radiographers\nhave employed a small point\nsource and a large detection\narea. This conventional configuration allows some degradation of image quality as the\ndetection medium registers\nthe secondary radiation\n(x-ray scatter) produced in\nthe object being bombarded\nby radiation.\nRGX reverses the conventional configuration. The\nobject to be x-rayed is placed\nadjacent to a large source\nwhose raster scan is picked\nup by a distant detector. In\nthis approach, much of the\nunwanted scatter generated\nin the object is absorbed by\nthe intermediate air before it\ncan reach the remote detector. The result is improved\nimage clarity and better\ninspection throughput, with\n\nfour times the contrast\nsensitivity of conventional\nsystems.\nUnder two Small Business\nInnovation Research (SBIR)\ncontracts, Digiray teamed\nwith Langley researchers of\nthe Center\'s Nondestructive\nEvaluation Sciences Branch\n(NESB) to develop a portable\nRGX system (portability is a\nnecessity for field inspection\nof aircraft), and to upgrade\nthe x-ray energy of the system so that thicker parts\ncould be x-rayed. The SBIR\nwork involved miniaturization of the system\'s sensors\nso they could be inserted\ninto internal aircraft structures, such as hard-to-get-at\ncorners and crevices. The\nproject gave Langley a device\nthat can be used not only for\naircraft inspections, but for\nassessing damage growth in\nmaterials, for supporting\ntests to show how structures\nbehave under stress, and for\nmonitoring changes in solid\n\nrocket fuel over time.\nThe Digiray project was\npart of a still-ongoingseven\nyear Langley program that is\nexploring ways to conduct\nthorough examinations of aircraft without disassembling\nthem by means of advanced\ninspection techniques, including ultrasound and thermography in addition to x-ray.\nDigiray further developed\nthe technology under separate arrangements with the\nU.S. Air Force, the Department of Energy\'s CEBAF (Continuous Beam Accelerator\nFacility) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\nThe RGX produces x-ray\nimages by means of a scintillating crystal detector in\nwhich a number of tiny crystals light up when excited by\nx-ray beams, creating an\nimage that is computer\nprocessed into a digital x-ray.\nThe image can then be\nenhanced by standard image\nprocessing tools, such as\n\naveraging, filtering, image\nsubtraction and edge\nenhancement. At right, a\nhelicopter tail rotor is undergoing inspection by Digiray to\nfind delamination and stress\ncracks; below, a Digiray\n\nThe feasibility of using the\nRGX system for computed\ntomography, which provides\ncross-sectional x-ray images,\nhas been demonstrated. With\nthe RGX, an entire family of\ncross-sectional images can\nbe obtained during a single\nrevolution of an object.\nThe RGX is being used by\nthe Air Force to x-ray parts\nof fighter aircraft, and by\nMcDonnell Douglas Corporation in a comparison study of\nRGX versus ultrasound\ninspection of composite aircraft structures. The portability of the system has led to\napplications in areas other\nthan aerospace, for example,\ninspection of pipes corroding\nunder insulation at oil\nrefineries, which has been\n\nidentified as a cause of serious refinery fires; at right is\nan image showing thinning in\nthe walls of a refinery pipe\nsection. Mobil Oil Corporation, Exxon and Shell Oil are\nconducting tests of the\nDigiray system.\nA related product that\nemerged from the Langley\nwork is the company\'s\npatented RGL (reverse geometry laminography) system\nthat provides layer-by-layer\nx-ray viewing with only one\nexposure. A demonstration\nof the RGL showed the system\'s ability to image both\nsides of a quarter -the\nWashington head and the\neagle tail -with a single\nexposure. The clarity of the\n\nimagery suggests that the\nsystem can enhance current\nimaging techniques in such\nareas as mammography,\ncardiac imaging, brain\nsurgery and orthopedics.\n\n(Continued)\n"RGX, Reverse Geometry X-rays and\nDigiray are registered trademark of\nDigiray Corporation.\n\nI\n\nINDUSTRIAL\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nSMALL BUSINESS\nINNOVATIONS\n\nContinually looking for\nnew ways to shave weight\nand improve the structural\nintegrity of Space Shuttle\ncomponents, NASA awarded\nseveral Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts to Nichols Research\nCorporation (NRC),\nHuntsville, Alabama for\ndevelopment of an advanced\nsystem to weld segments of\nthe 154foot-long Space Shuttle External Tank. NRC successfully developed such a\nsystem and commercialized\nthe technology with the marketing of a device known as\nWire PilotTM.\n\nEssentially a small robot,\nthe Wire Pilot @elow) is a\nprogrammable, motorized\nthree-axis manipulator for\nprecise positioning of filler\nwire relative to the welding\ntorch and workpiece.\nDesigned to automate the\nplacement of filler wire during precision automatic and\nrobotic welding, the wire\nmanipulator is housed in a\ncompact, rugged, nine-inch\npackage that accepts standard wire feeder guide tips.\nA hand-held unit (right)\nenables control of the filler\nwire entry angle, the force\nagainst the workpiece, and\n\nthe offset from the weld\ncenterline. The controller\nelectronics are shown\nat lower right.\nA miniature load cell built\ninto the wire guide tip assembly senses the force between\nthe workpiece and the filler\nwire, and closed loop control\ndrives the motors to keep\nthis force constant, thus\nmaintaining a constant force\nbetween the filler wire and\nthe workpiece regardless of\nautomatic voltage control\n(AVC) adjustments or reactions to condition changes.\nThe load cell output can also\nbe used as an AVC feedback\n\nsignal to provide constant\ntorch-to-wire distance.\nThe Wire Pilot employs a\nunique configuration of three\nlinear drives to achieve high\nprecision threeaxis coordinated motion. The three axes\nof motion are the X axis\n(sideto-side), the Y axis\n(inlout), and the Z axis (angle\nchange). The Z axis rotates\nabout an operator-defined\ntoolpoint that is programmed\nto the location where the\nwire enters the weld pool.\nThis prevents angle changes\nfrom affecting the force on\nthe wire pressure load cell.\nBecause operator or\nequipment malfunctions can\ncause the unit to be crashed\ninto the workpiece, a twostage crash protection system is built into the device.\nFor slight crashes, a spring\non the upper drive rod flexes,\nallowing the tip to rotate\nwithout sustaining damage.\nIn more severe crashes, the\nentire unit slides backward\nup to one inch on its base\nplate without damage. It is\n\nspring loaded to return to its\nnormal position.\nThe Wire Pilot was developed as a stand-alone system\nor as part of a VME-based\ncontrol system. The standalone system consists of the\nwire manipulator, the controller and an operator\'s\npendant. The controller\nboard can be integrated\ndirectly into VMEbased\nsystems.\n\nMarshall Space Flight\nCenter managed the SBIR\ncontracts and engineers/\ntechnicians of Marshall\'s\nMaterials Processor Branch\nassisted NRC throughout the\ndevelopment of the system.\nTM Wire Pilot is a trademark of\nNichols Research Corporation.\n\nINDUSTRIAL\nPRODUC\'TMTY\n\n'
