The step height was set at 76% of the local unperturbed boundary-layer thickness at the step location, and the shape was varied by placing three ramps of differing slopes and shapes on the downstream face of the step, including a 30\u25e6ramp, rounded ramp, and a 5\u25e6ramp. In addition, the square step shape (with noramp) was studied. The 5\u25e6ramp was the only one that was successful at substantially delaying transition downstream of the step. Even so, it did not completely mitigate the effect of the step. The 5\u25e6ramp significantly altered the mean flow, significantly reducing the separation region downstream of the step. While this geometry still resulted in increased growth of the stationary crossflow instability, it substantially reduced the amplitude of the unsteady instabilities that grew downstream of the step. In particular, this ramp completely eliminated the low-frequency, traveling crossflow mode that was observed in the other cases.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20200011448, "endDate": "2020-06-19T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "7f432c374abf4cff99eb9c63d3e4e3c4", "id": "9e9a6bc00046428ba53b65f22245a74b"}], "name": "AIAA Aviation 2020", "location": "Virtual", "id": "7f432c374abf4cff99eb9c63d3e4e3c4", "startDate": "2020-06-15T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20200011448.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20200011448/downloads/20200011448.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20200011448/downloads/20200011448.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20200011448/downloads/20200011448.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
