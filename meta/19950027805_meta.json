CCRS has much expertise in developing systems for integrating geographic information with space and aircraft remote sensing data and in managing large archives of remotely sensed data. SEIDAM will be composed of expert systems grouped in three levels. At the lowest level, the expert systems will manage and integrate data from diverse sources, taking account of symbolic representation differences and varying accuracies. Existing software can be controlled by these expert systems, without rewriting existing software into an Artificial Intelligence (AI) language. At the second level, SEIDAM will take the interpreted data (symbolic and numerical) and combine these with data models. at the top level, SEIDAM will respond to user goals for predictive outcomes given existing data. The SEIDAM Project will address the research areas of expert systems, data management, storage and retrieval, and user access and interfaces.", "title": "System of experts for intelligent data management (SEIDAM)", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950027805, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Goodenough, David G."}, "organization": {"name": "Canada Centre for Remote Sensing", "location": "Victoria British Columbia, Canada"}}, "id": "2b2954c67b124241821a28b3a428f1ad"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950027805, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Iisaka, Joji"}, "organization": {"name": "Canada Centre for Remote Sensing", "location": "Victoria British Columbia, Canada"}}, "id": "3a5abd5a7aa64ff5b68d0f7b92bdd20c"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19950027805, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fung, KO"}, "organization": {"name": "Canada Centre for Remote Sensing", "location": "Ottawa, Ontario., Canada"}}, "id": "e5b3f789b7304094a5a6fabe9901aabb"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950027805, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950027805, "id": "deb802fe24ad44689a3b420b50862d42", "publicationName": "Colorado Univ., Applied Information Systems Research Program (AISRP) Workshop 3 Meeting Proceedings", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19950027797, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Applied Information Systems Research Program (AISRP) Workshop 3 meeting proceedings", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
