The challenge is to engineer a more flexible Spaceport to\nbe capable of supporting manufacturing, assembly, testing, processing and launch operations\nfor multiple spacecrafts and launch vehicle configurations. The new spaceport must support\nmultiple commercial as well as government entities while leveraging existing infrastructure to the\ngreatest extent possible.\nThis paper addresses key engineering challenges during Spaceport design and development\nand will look at possible engineering solutions while considering reusability of legacy systems\nand infrastructure adaptability with emphasis on flexibility and reduction of operating cost.\n\n'
