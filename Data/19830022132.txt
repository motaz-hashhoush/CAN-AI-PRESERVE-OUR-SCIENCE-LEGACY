airplanes.\nThe task is to incorporate fuel-saving concepts into commercial\n\naircraft\n\ndesign.\n\nThe\n\npotential weight savings and fuel reduction resulting from the exten-\n\nsive use of advanced composites\n\nin aircraft structure are significant.\n\nHowever, the lack of technical confidence and cost data has delayed their\nuse in commercial aircraft.\n\nH_-dware programs considered in a production\n\nenvironment are required to\n\nestablish and demonstrate the safety, operating-life\n\ncharacteristics,\n\nand\n\nmanufacturing cost of advanced composites structure.\n\nBoeing\'s approach to the problem is to obtain reliable production,\n,\n\ntech-\n\nnical, and cost data bases by the integration of advanced composites\n\ntech-\n\nnolog_v development under NASA contracts, which, when combined with company\neffort, wlil accelerate the application of composites.\n\nThis approach\n\naddresses these data bases, developing realistic production\ncommercial transport
