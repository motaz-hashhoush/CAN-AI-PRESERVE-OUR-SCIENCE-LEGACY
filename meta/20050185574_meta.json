In particular, w e examine whether the euphoria surrounding JetBlue s IPO carried over to other firms in the sector by testing whether the shares of JetBlue s competitors showed a significant price reaction to JetBlue s IPO. JetBlue's IPO took place just a few months following September 11, 2001. These events resulted in dramatic changes in the airline industry and had significant implications on the economic gains of airlines. We examine JetBlue s accounting and stock performance and compare it to the relative performance of Southwest Airlines (SWA), a representative of the loa-cost carrier group. In addition, we compare both JetBlue's and SWA's financial condition and the relative performance of their stock to two mainline U S. carriers, Continental and Northwest. representatives of the conventional-cost carrier group. We analyze whether there are any performance differences among the low-cost carriers and between low-cost carriers and conventional-cost carriers. In particular, we examine whether low-cost carriers were able to sustain the economic impacts of 9/11 better than the conventional-cost carriers.", "title": "Confidence in Airline Performance in Difficult Market Conditions: An Analysis of JetBlue's Financial Market Results", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050185574, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Flouris, Triant"}, "organization": {"name": "Concordia Univ.", "location": "Montreal, Quebec, Canada"}}, "id": "6324dba28bc649379a9c5fe1055d3003"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20050185574, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Walker, Thomas"}, "organization": {"name": "Concordia Univ.", "location": "Montreal, Quebec, Canada"}}, "id": "8abe82affc8446d9afa1d4a2e13abe27"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050185574, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050185574, "id": "aa7fca57fbf64c39861ecc7412f104cd", "publicationName": "Journal of Air Transportation, Volume 10, No. 1", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050185574.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050185574/downloads/20050185574.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050185574/downloads/20050185574.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050185574/downloads/20050185574.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
