Intelligent\nAutomation, Inc., has developed a security-enhanced autonomous network\nmanagement (SEANM) approach for space networks through cross-layer\nnegotiation and network monitoring, analysis, and adaptation. The underlying\ntechnology is bundle-based delay/disruption-tolerant networking (DTN).\nThe SEANM scheme allows a system to adaptively reconfigure its network\nelements based on awareness of network conditions, policies, and mission\nrequirements. Although SEANM is generically applicable to any radio\nnetwork, for validation purposes it has been prototyped and evaluated on\ntwo specific networks: a commercial off-the-shelf hardware testbed using\nInstitute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 Wi-Fi devices and a military\nhardware testbed using AN/PRC-154 Rifleman Radio platforms. Testing\nhas demonstrated that SEANM provides autonomous network management\nresulting in reliable communications in delay/disruptive-prone environments.\n\nApplications\nNASA\n\nCommercial\n\n}} Space Communications and\nNavigation (SCaN) network\nintegration\n}} Robotic missions\n\n}} Dynamic and tactical military\nenvironments\n}} Undersea networks\n}} Satellite communications\n}} Wireless sensor and ad hoc\nnetworks\n\nPhase II Objectives\n}} Develop an autonomous\nnetworking and network\nmanagement system for space\nnetworks:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Advanced bundle protocolbased DTN network support\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Proactive network monitoring\nand prediction\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Cross-layer information sharing\nand negotiation\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Network analysis and\nreconfiguration\n}} Implement the proposed\nSEANM scheme using hardware\nimplementations\n}} Perform extensive performance\nevaluations\n}} Develop and incorporate\nthe developed concepts and\ntechniques into prototypes\nBenefits\n}} Reduces costs\n}} Enhances reliability\nFirm Contact\nIntelligent Automation, Inc.\nHui Zeng\nhzeng@i-a-i.com\n15400 Calhoun Drive, Suite 190\nRockville, MD 20855\xe2\x80\x932737\nPhone: 301\xe2\x80\x93294\xe2\x80\x934258\nProposal Number: 10-2 O1.06-8084\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218828\n\n2\n\n'
