b'NASA funding opportunities for optical fabrication and testing\ntechnology development\nH. Philip Stahl,\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center\nABSTRACT\nNASA requires technologies to fabricate and test optical components to accomplish its highest priority science missions.\nThe NRC ASTRO2010 Decadal Survey states that an advanced large-aperture UVOIR telescope is required to enable\nthe next generation of compelling astrophysics and exo-planet science; and, that present technology is not mature enough\nto affordably build and launch any potential UVOIR mission concept. The NRC 2012 NASA Space Technology\nRoadmaps and Priorities Report states that the highest priority technology in which NASA should invest to \xe2\x80\x98Expand our\nunderstanding of Earth and the universe\xe2\x80\x99 is next generation X-ray and UVOIR telescopes. Each of the Astrophysics\ndivision Program Office Annual Technology Reports (PATR) identifies specific technology needs. NASA has a variety\nof programs to fund enabling technology development: SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research); the ROSES APRA\nand SAT programs (Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science; Astrophysics Research and Analysis program;\nStrategic Astrophysics Technology program); and several Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) programs.\nKeywords: Technology Development\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nSince its inception, NASA has depended on technology innovation to enable its highest priority goals. Per the 2012\nNASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan1, in Fiscal Year 2012 NASA invested nearly $1 billion in\npioneering and crosscutting technology development to accomplish the Goals defined in the 2011 NASA Strategic Plan 2.\nOf that amount, as shown in Figure 1, approximately 8% or $80 million was invested in optics and photonics related\ntechnologies: 8.1.1 Detectors and Focal Planes; 8.1.3 Optical Systems (Instruments and Sensors); and 8.2.4 High\nContrast Imaging and Spectroscopy Technologies.\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of FY12 technology investment across the NRC top 16 priorities for NASA.\n\nThese 3 technologies were defined in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Technology Assessment (TA08) on Science Instruments, Observatories\nand Sensor Systems3-5, then redefined by the NRC report on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Technology Roadmaps and Priorities and\nidentified as being 3 of the most important 16 technologies in which NASA should invest over the next 5 years 6.\n\nSPIE OptiFab Conference Paper 8884-501, 2013\n\nNASA uses many different funding mechanisms for investing in technology (Figure 2), but most optics and photonics\nrelated investments are made by either the Science Mission Directorate of the Office of the Chief Technologist.\n\nFigure 2: FY2012 Space Technology Programs by Mission Directorate and Office\n\nThe most important programs for optics and photonics technology are SBIR/STTR; SMD\xe2\x80\x99s Research Opportunities in\nSpace and Earth Science (ROSES) which includes APRA (Astrophysics Research and Analysis), SAT (Strategic\nAstrophysics Technology), ESTO (Earth Science Technology Office); and OCT\xe2\x80\x99s NASA Innovative Advanced\nConcepts (NIAC) and Space Technology Research Opportunities (STRO).\n\n2. GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS\n2.1\n\nDecadal Studies\n\nIn the area of Science, NASA does not define its own priorities. Rather, NASA implements (within the constraints of its\nCongressionally authorized budget) the priorities define by the National Research Council decadal studies in\nAstrophysics, Heliophysics, Earth Science and Planetary Science7-10. These studies produce a prioritized list of the most\ncompelling science questions to be answered over the next 10 years and make recommendations to NASA for potential\nmissions to answer these questions. Additionally, the NRC Decadal Reports make recommendations to NASA regarding\ntechnology investments needed to enable these missions.\nFor example, the 2010 Astrophysics Decadal Study recommended the following optics related technology investments:\nx\nx\n\nmanufacturing a low-mass large-aperture x-ray mirror which achieves an angular resolution of 5 arcseconds for\nthe International X-Ray Observatory (IXO). Estimated to cost about $200 million;\n\nx\n\nstarlight suppression techniques (e.g. coronagraphy, interferometry or star shades) for direct detection of exoplanets. A budget of $4M per year is recommended for the first several years of the decade;\n\nx\n2.2\n\nachieving a telescope with sufficient image quality over the focal plane necessary for a weak lensing study;\n\nmanufacturing, testing and coating of a 4-meter or larger wide-field-of-view high-efficiency UV/Optical\n(Hubble replacement) telescope and detectors. A notional budget of $40M is recommended for the decade.\nTechnology Taxonomy\n\nThe three optics related technologies discussed in NASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan (8.1.1 Detectors\nand Focal Planes, 8.1.3 Optical Systems, and 8.2.4 High Contrast Imaging and Spectroscopy Technologies) were defined\nin NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Technology Assessment (TA08) on Science Instruments, Observatories and Sensor Systems, then redefined\nby the NRC report on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Technology Roadmaps and Priorities.\n\nSPIE OptiFab Conference Paper 8884-501, 2013\n\n2.2.1\n\nTechnology Assessment Roadmap\n\nIn 2010, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Office of the Chief Technologist published 14 Technology Assessments: TA01 Launch Propulsion\nSystems; TA02 In-Space Propulsion Technologies; TA03 Space Power and Energy Storage; TA04 Robotics,\nTeleRobotics and Autonomous Systems; TA05 Communications and Navigation; TA06 Human Health, Life Support\nand Habitation Systems; TA07 Human Exploration Destination Systems; TA08 Science Instruments, Observatories and\nSensor Systems; TA09 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems; TA10 Nanotechnology; TA11 Modeling, Simulation,\nInformation Technology and Processing; TA12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing; TA13\nGround and Launch Systems Processing; and TA14 Thermal Management Systems.\nEach assessment defined its own technology taxonomy. The Science Instruments, Observatories and Sensors Systems\n(SIOSS) report was Technology Assessment 08 (TA08)3-5. Figure 3 shows the TA08 Technology Area Breakdown\nStructure (TABS). In general, only TABS 8.1.3 Optical Components and TABS 8.2.1 Large Mirror Systems require the\ndevelopment of optical manufacturing the testing technology.\n\nFigure 3: Technology Area 08 (TA08) Breakdown Structure\n\nScience Instruments (TABS 8.1) require both incremental improvements and breakthrough technologies to enable\nentirely new instrument or observatory architectures. Optical component technology (TABS 8.1.3) challenges include:\nstarlight suppression; active wavefront control; and advanced spectrometers/instruments. Specific technology needs\ninclude: Broadband and spectral optical coatings for uniform high throughput; Ability to fabricate aspheric optical\ncomponents for novel optical systems with large fields of view; Highly stable optical support structures; High spectral\nresolution dispersive elements; and Precision Wavefront Sensing and Control. TABS 8.1.3 is specifically intended to\ncover \xe2\x80\x98small\xe2\x80\x99 beam space (i.e. < 0.5 meter diameter) optical components and only the manufacture of non-conventional\naspheric optics because the manufacture of small and conventionally aspheric optics is a proven technology.\nObservatory (TABS 8.2) are necessary to design, manufacture, test, and operate space telescopes which collect,\nconcentrate and/or transmit photons. Observatory technologies enable or enhance large-aperture monolithic and/or\nsegmented single apertures as well as structurally connected and/or free-flying sparse and interferometric apertures.\nApplications span the electromagnetic spectrum, from X-ray to UVOIR to radio-wave. Planned and potential future\nNASA missions require specific enabling observatory technologies: Large Grazing and Normal Incidence Mirror\nSystems (TABS 8.2.1); Large Ultra-stable structures; Large-deployable/assembled structures; Control of Large\n\nSPIE OptiFab Conference Paper 8884-501, 2013\n\nStructures; and Formation Flying. Deployment, assembly or formation flying technology is required to create extralarge apertures \xe2\x80\x93 where formation flying produces an actively controlled virtual structure. For all applications,\nregardless of whether the mirror system aperture is 0.5 m or 5 m or the angle of incidence is grazing or normal, the\nfundamental driving need is larger-collecting aperture with better performance at a lower cost per square meter. TABS\n8.2.1 technologies achieve this performance capability: ability to manufacture and test large-mirror systems (normal and\ngrazing incidence); ability to deposit large-aperture, uniform (amplitude and polarization), broadband high reflectance\ncoatings; and ability to structurally hold the mirror system in a stable, strain-free state under the influence of anticipated\ndynamic and thermal stimuli. TABS 8.2.1 was specifically defined as covering the technologies need to make large\nmirror systems because the technologies needed to make such systems are entirely different from the technologies\nneeded to make small optical systems.\n2.2.2\n\nNRC Report on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Technology Roadmaps and Priorities\n\nIn 2012, each of the 14 Technology Assessment reports were reviewed by a committee of the National Research Council\nwhich published its findings in \xe2\x80\x9cNASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities: Restoring NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Technological\nEdge and Paving the Way for a New Era in Space\xe2\x80\x9d6. The primary result of this report was the definition of 16 key\ntechnologies in which NASA should invest over the next 5 years to meet the Top Technical Challenges necessary to\naccomplish three primary Objectives: Objective A, Extend and sustain human activities beyond low Earth orbit;\nObjective B, Explore the evolution of the solar system and the potential for life elsewhere; Objective C, Expand our\nunderstanding of Earth and the universe in which we live. While optics and photonics technology can help enable all of\nthese Objectives, the most relevant is Objective C. The committee determined that the second most important Top\nTechnical Challenge to accomplish Objective C (after improved access to space) is \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloping a new generation of\nlarger-aperture lower-cost Astronomical Telescopes that enable discovery of habitable planets, facilitate advances in\nsolar physics, and enable the study of faint structures around bright objects by developing high-contrast imaging and\nspectroscopic technologies to provide unprecedented sensitivity, field of view and spectroscopy of faint objects.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe committee identified 3 optical Top Technologies in which NASA needs to invest over the next 5 years to meet the\nNew Telescopes Top Technical Challenge: Optical Systems (8.1.3), High Contrast Imaging and Spectroscopy (8.2.4),\nand Detectors and Focal Planes (8.1.1). The committee created Optical Systems (8.1.2) by deciding to delete TA08\nTABS 8.2.1 Large Mirror Systems and merge it with TABS 8.1.3 Optical Components because \xe2\x80\x9cthe technologies are\nvery similar and it would be most effective to develop these technologies together.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, the committee decided to\ncreate High Contrast Imaging and Spectroscopy (8.2.4) to fill the gap created by deleting TA08 TABS 8.2.1 because the\n\xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment of advanced approaches to high-dynamic-range imaging would be a game-changing technology to support\nexoplanet imaging, which is a priority initiative in the Astro2010 decadal survey for astronomy and astrophysics (NRC,\n2010). This technology would provide unprecedented sensitivity, field of view, and spectroscopy of exoplanetary\nsystems, with many subsidiary applications such as solar physics and the study of faint structures around bright objects\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe committee identified two game-changing Optical System technologies that would enable direct imaging of stars and\ndetailed imaging of energetic objects such as active galactic nuclei: active wavefront control and grazing-incidence\noptical systems. Active wavefront control technology was defined as modifying mirror figure and alignment in response\nto external disturbances, allowing automated on-orbit alignment of optical systems and the use of lightweight mirrors\nand telescopes. This technology closely aligns with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s need to develop the next generation of large-aperture\nastronomical telescopes, lightweight laser communication systems, and high-performance orbiting observatories for\nplanetary missions. To enable future x-ray astronomy missions, grazing-incidence optical systems require improved\nspatial resolution by at least a factor of ten, without increasing mass per unit area. This will involve improvements in\nproduction systems for piezo adjustment of thin slumped glass and in mounting and testing the sets of optics.\nApplications are for x-ray and far ultraviolet (UV) (<500 Angstrom) astronomy, and may be extended into the soft\ngamma/hard x-ray region (to ~100 keV). The committee cited adjustable grazing incidence x-ray optics based on thin\nslumped glass as an example of a strong linkage between these technologies. A third game-changing technology\nidentified by the committee is normal incidence mirrors with diameters of four meters and beyond that operate to\nwavelengths as low as 30 nm.\n2.3\n\nProgram Office Annual Technology Report\n\nEach of the three Astrophysics Division Program Offices (Exoplanet Exploration, Physics of the Cosmos and Cosmic\nOrigins) publishes a Program Annual Technology Report (PATR).11-13 These reports provide detailed information about\nthe current technology needs and the prioritization of these needs for each Program Area.\n\nSPIE OptiFab Conference Paper 8884-501, 2013\n\n3. NASA CORE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS\nAs defined by the NASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan, core technologies are indispensable for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\npresent and planned future missions. Because of this importance, core technologies comprise approximately 70% of the\nAgency\xe2\x80\x99s technology investment over the next four years. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s core technologies are:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\nLaunch and In-Space Propulsion\nHigh Data Rate Communications\nLightweight Space Structures and Materials\nRobotics and Autonomous Systems\nEnvironmental Control and Life Support Systems\nSpace Radiation Mitigation\nScientific Instruments and Sensors\n\nWhile optics and photonics technology are enabling for many of these core technologies, such as High Data Rate\nCommunications and Robotic and Autonomous Systems, the primary core area is Scientific Instruments and Sensors.\nFor the next four years, NASA will invest in observatory technologies with improved performance and angular\nresolution, and reduced weight and cost. Specific emphasis will be on large mirror systems and structures. Potential\nlarge mirror investments include x-ray mirrors, lightweight mirrors, ultraviolet coatings and segmented mirrors.\nPotential structure investments include passive and active ultra-stable structures, and deployable telescopes and booms.\nObservatory technologies are necessary to design, manufacture, test and operate space telescopes that collect,\nconcentrate and detect photons for astronomy missions. The capabilities of an observatory often dictate the limits of an\nastronomy mission. Relieving those limits and enabling new missions such as high-contrast exoplanet imaging, requires\ninnovative observatory technologies, in some cases with an order of magnitude improvement. Low-mass grazingincidence optical systems achieving an order of magnitude improvement in spatial resolution will enable advanced future\nx-ray astronomy missions. Other advances in observatory technologies such as integrated, adjustable, normal-incidence\nmirror systems can enable direct imaging of stars and detailed imaging of energetic objects such as active galactic nuclei.\nOne potential exoplanet observatory concept involves the deployment and shape control of a large occulting starshade\nand formation flying of the starshade relative to the associated telescope. Other techniques for observing exoplanets\ninclude interferometry and coronagraphy. Innovations in materials for observatories may enable ultra-stable, large space\nstructures. Regardless of the implementation architecture (segmented or monolithic, active or adjustable, etc.), all future\nspace science missions can benefit from low-cost, low-risk, high-performance space optical systems.\n\n4. SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATIVE RESEARCH (SBIR)\nThe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was established by Congress in 1982 (and reauthorized in\n2000) to provide increased opportunities for small businesses to participate in R&D, to increase employment and to\nimprove US competitiveness. The program\xe2\x80\x99s specific objectives are to stimulate US technological innovation, use small\nbusinesses to meet federal research and development needs, increase private-sector commercialization of innovations\nderived from federal R&D and foster and encourage participation by socially disadvantaged businesses. The Small\nBusiness Technology Transfer (STTR) program is a separately funded activity which awards contracts to small business\nconcerns for cooperative research and development with a non-profit research institution such as a university. The\nSBIR/STTR programs are funded via a \xe2\x80\x98set-aside\xe2\x80\x99 of approximately 6% of each federal agencies \xe2\x80\x98extra-mural\xe2\x80\x99 R&D\nbudget. The entire SBIR/STTR federal budget for FY11 was approximately $2.6B of which approximately 10% or\n$250M was invested by NASA. The DoD and Homeland Security percentage of the budget was ~70% while the DOE\nand NSF percentage was ~15%.\nThe SBIR/STTR program uses a two stage process. Proposals selected for Phase 1 funding receive $125K and either 6\nor 12 months (depending upon whether they are SBIR or STTR) to accomplish their objectives. If awarded a Phase II,\nthey receive $750K over 24 months. Starting in FY12, NASA created the SBIR Select program which awards $200K\nfor Phase I and $1.5M for Phase II. Starting in FY13, NASA is adding to new programs: Phase II-Enhanced (II-E) and\nPhase II-eXpanded (II-X). Under the Phase II-E program, the NASA SBIR office will match 1:1 eligible \xe2\x80\x98external\xe2\x80\x99\ninvestment of up to $125K and provide up to 12 months of additional performance period. Under the Phase II-X\nprogram, the NASA SBIR office will match 2:1 eligible \xe2\x80\x98external\xe2\x80\x99 investments of up to $250K and provide up to 12\n\nSPIE OptiFab Conference Paper 8884-501, 2013\n\nmonths of additional performance period. For example, the NASA SBIR/STTR program will match up to $500K a\n$250K investment from a non-SBIR/STTR NASA Source. Additionally, once a company has a Phase 1 contract, they\ncan receive a Phase III contract without going through a competitive bidding process.\nSBIR/STTR proposals used to be solicited in the summer, but NASA is shifting the call for proposals to late fall to better\nalign the program with the federal budget cycle. The 2013 call for proposals is expected to be released the first week of\nNovember 2013. In 2012, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s SBIR program solicited proposals in Topics in Aeronautics Research, Human\nExploration and Operations and Science (Table 1)\nTable 1: NASA 2012 SBIR Solicited Research Topics\nAeronautics Research\nA1 Aviation Safety\nA2 Air Traffic Management Research and Development (ATM R&D)\nA3 Air Vehicle Technologies\n\nHuman Exploration and Operations\nH1 In-Situ Resource Utilization\nH2 Space Transportation\nH3 Life Support and Habitation Systems\nH4 Extra-Vehicular Activity Technology\nH5 Lightweight Spacecraft Materials and Structures\nH6 Autonomous and Robotic Systems\nH7 Entry, Descent and Landing Technology\nH8 High Efficiency Space Power Systems\nH9 Space Communications and Navigation\nH10 Ground Processing and ISS Utilization\nH12 Human Research and Health Maintenance\n\nScience\nS1 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments\nS2 Advanced Telescope Systems\nS3 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems\nS4 Robotic Exploration Technologies\nS5 Information Technologies\n\nWhile optic and photonic technology can be enabling for the Aeronautics and Exploration topics, most optic technology\ninvestment is made in support of Science. Table 2 lists the topics and subtopics which seek to develop technology to\nenable science missions. The two topics most relevant to optical fabrication and testing technology are S2.03 Advanced\nOptical Component Systems and S2.04 Optics Manufacturing and Metrology for Telescope Optical Surfaces.\n4.1\n\nS2.03 Advanced Optical Systems\n\nConsistent with all guidance documents, S2.03 \xe2\x80\x98Advanced Optical Systems\xe2\x80\x99 solicits proposals to mature technologies to\nmanufacture, test, coat or operate complete mirror systems for potential x-ray or UV/Optical missions.\nFuture x-ray missions required x-ray imaging telescopes with < 1 arc-sec angular resolution and greater than 1 to 5 m2\ncollecting area (0.3 to 2 meter diameter mirror shells or segments); improved metrology, performance prediction and\ntesting techniques; active control of mirror shape; and new structures for holding and actively aligning of mirrors in a\ntelescope assembly. For individual mirror shells, axial slope errors should be ~ 1 arc-sec rms (~100 nm rms figure error\nfor 20 mm spatial frequencies) and surface finish should be < 0.5 nm rms. And, total mass for the total integrated mirror\nsystem (shells and structure) should be < 1000 kg. Finally, multilayer gradient coatings are needed for potential future\nhard x-ray mirrors (similar to NuSTAR) with high broadband reflectivity for 5 to 80 keV energy photons.\nFuture UVOIR missions require 4 to 8 or 16 meter monolithic or segmented primary mirrors with < 10 nm rms surface\nfigures. Mirror areal density depends upon available launch vehicle capacities to Sun-Earth L2 (i.e. 15 kg/m2 for a 5 m\nfairing EELV vs. 60 kg/m2 for a 10 m fairing SLS). Future UVOIR missions also require coatings with broadband\nreflectivity > 60% and uniform polarization from 90 nm to 2500 nm which can be deposited onto a 2 to 4 to 8 meter\nmirror substrate. Additionally, the coatings need to have > 90% reflectivity from 450 nm to 2500 nm. Future EUV\nmissions require coatings with reflectivity > 90% from 6 nm to 200 nm which can be deposited onto mirror substrates as\nlarge as 2.4 meters in diameter.\n\nSPIE OptiFab Conference Paper 8884-501, 2013\n\nTable 2: NASA 2012 SBIR Science Topics and Sub-Topics\nTOPIC S1 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments\nS1.01 Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies\nS1.02 Microwave Technologies for Remote Sensing\nS1.03 Sensor and Detector Technology for Visible, IR, Far IR and Submillimeter\nS1.04 Detector Technologies for UV, X-Ray, Gamma-Ray and Cosmic-Ray Instruments\nS1.05 Particles and Field Sensors and Instrument Enabling Technologies\nS1.06 Cryogenic Systems for Sensors and Detectors\nS1.07 In Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Lunar and Planetary Science\nS1.08 Airborne Measurement Systems\nS1.09 Surface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems\n\nTOPIC S2 Advanced Telescope Systems\nS2.01 Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronagraphy\nS2.02 Precision Deployable Optical Structures and Metrology\nS2.03 Advanced Optical Component Systems\nS2.04 Optics Manufacturing and Metrology for Telescope Optical Surfaces\n\nTOPIC S3 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems\nS3.01 Command, Data Handling, and Electronics\nS3.02 Power Generation and Conversion\nS3.03 Propulsion Systems\nS3.04 Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storage\nS3.05 Unmanned Aircraft and Sounding Rocket Technologies\n\nTOPIC S4 Robotic Exploration Technologies\nS4.01 Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing Technology\nS4.02 Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling\nS4.03 Spacecraft Technology for Sample Return Missions\n\nTOPIC S5 Information Technologies\nS5.01 Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation\nS5.02 Earth Science Applied Research and Decision Support\nS5.03 Algorithms & Tools for Science Data Processing, Discovery & Analysis, in State-of-the-Art Data Environments\nS5.04 Integrated Science Mission Modeling\nS5.05 Fault Management Technologies\n\nTOPIC E3 Select Science\nE3.01 Laser Transmitters and Receivers for Targeted Earth Science Measurements\nE3.02 Advanced Technology Telescope for Balloon Mission\nE3.03 Extreme Environments Technology\n\n4.2\n\nS2.04 Optics Manufacturing and Metrology for Telescope Optical Surfaces\n\nThis subtopic focuses primarily on manufacturing and metrology of optical surfaces, especially for very small or very\nlarge and/or thin optics.

RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES IN SPACE AND EARTH SCIENCE (ROSES)\nResearch Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) is how the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD)\nsolicits basic and applied research in support of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s strategic goals:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAdvance Earth System Science to meet the challenges of climate and environmental change;\nUnderstand the Sun and its interactions with the Earth and the solar system;\nAscertain the content, origin, and evolution of the solar system and the potential for life elsewhere; and\nDiscover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for Earth-like planets.\n\nSMD pursues NASA\xe2\x80\x99s strategic outcomes using sub-orbital and space programs from Earth orbit to, or even beyond,\nobjects in the solar system; and also through ground-based research activities. ROSES solicits proposals for groundbased supporting research and technology (SR&T) investigations that seek to understand naturally occurring space and\nEarth phenomena, human-induced changes in the Earth system, and Earth and space science-related technologies and to\nsupport the national goals for further robotic and human exploration of space. ROSES covers all aspects of basic and\napplied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences, including, but not limited to: theory, modeling,\nand analysis of SMD science data; aircraft, stratospheric balloon, suborbital rocket, International Space Station, and\nsuborbital reusable launch vehicle investigations; development of experiment techniques suitable for future SMD space\nmissions; development of concepts for future SMD space missions; development of advanced technologies relevant to\nSMD missions; Earth surface observations and field campaigns that support SMD science missions; etc.\n\nSPIE OptiFab Conference Paper 8884-501, 2013\n\nSMD activities are organized into four Research Programs (aligned to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s strategic goals):\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Earth Science Division sponsors research to explore interactions among major components of the\nEarth system, to distinguish natural from human-induced causes of change, and to understand and predict\nthe consequences of change.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Heliophysics Division sponsors research to understand the Sun as a magnetic variable star and its\neffects on the Earth and other planets, and the dynamics of structures in the solar system.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Planetary Science Division sponsors research to explore the solar system to study its origins and\nevolution, including the origins of life within it.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Astrophysics Division sponsors research to explore the universe beyond, from the search for planets\nand life in other solar systems to the origin, evolution, structure, and destiny of the universe itself.\n\nEach SMD Division (Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics and Planetary Science) solicits proposals for Advanced\nComponent Technology and Instrument Development to enable their specific science measurement needs. Frequently,\nthe advanced components needed to enable future instruments require optics and photonics technology (detectors,\ndispersion gratings, spectral filters, wavefront sensors, deformable mirrors, optical elements, optical coatings, etc.). For\nAstrophysics, most optics related technology development is funded via either the Astrophysics Research and Analysis\n(APRA) or Strategic Astrophysics Technology (SAT) programs. In general, APRA funds early-TRL (TRL 1-3) and\nSAT funds mid-TRL (TRL 4-6) technology development. Please note, all proposals must clearly explain why their\ntechnology is relevant to or will help enable a specific high-priority SMD science measurement need.\nAwards range from under $100K per year for focused, limited efforts (e.g., data analysis) to more than $1M per year for\nextensive activities (e.g., development of science experiment hardware). The typical period of performance for an award\nis three to five years. In Fiscal Years 2012 (FY12), the APRA program spent about $20M on detectors and supporting\ntechnology development, and about $23.5M on suborbital flight payloads (including technology demonstrations); SAT\nspent $10 to $15M. Organizations of every type, domestic and foreign, Government and private, for profit and not-forprofit, may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. But, it is NASA policy that all investigations\ninvolving non-U.S. organizations must be conducted with no exchange of funds.\nFor more information about ROSES, go to http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ and subscribe to the SMD notification system.\nAnd, for more information about NASA\xe2\x80\x99s strategic vision, go to http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy.\n5.1\n\nAstrophysics Research and Analysis Program (APRA)\n\nThe Astrophysics Research and Analysis Program (APRA) program solicits basic (i.e. TRL 1-3) research proposals for\ninvestigations that are relevant to NASA\'s programs in astronomy and astrophysics and includes research over the entire\nrange of photons, gravitational waves, and particles of cosmic origin. APRA seeks to support research that addresses the\nbest possible (i) state-of-the-art detector technology development for instruments that may be proposed as candidate\nexperiments for future space flight opportunities; (ii) science and/or technology investigations that can be carried out\nwith instruments flown on suborbital sounding rockets, stratospheric balloons, or other platforms; and (iii) supporting\ntechnology, laboratory research, and/or (with restrictions) ground-based observations that are directly applicable to space\nastrophysics missions. While the solicitation of detector technology development is explicit, proposals for the\ndevelopment of optics, mirrors, coating or grating technology is specifically solicited in \xe2\x80\x98Supporting Technology\xe2\x80\x99.\n5.2\n\nStrategic Astrophysics Technology Program (SAT)\n\nThe Strategic Astrophysics Technology (SAT) program supports focused development of key technologies needed to\nenable major missions in the three science themes of the Astrophysics Division (Exoplanet, Cosmic Origins or Physics\nof the Cosmos). The SAT program is designed to support the maturation of technologies whose feasibility has already\nbeen demonstrated (i.e., TRL 3), to the point where they can be incorporated into NASA flight missions (TRL 6-7).\nSometimes referred to as the "mid-TRL gap," funding for such intermediate TRL development activities has historically\nbeen problematic because technologies in this regime are sufficiently mature that they are ill suited to funding under\nbasic research programs, The problem of the mid-TRL gap was of sufficient concern that an enhancement in funding\nspecifically targeted at mid-TRL development is included among the Small Project recommendations in Astro2010.\n\nSPIE OptiFab Conference Paper 8884-501, 2013\n\nSAT solicits proposals in three science areas:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTechnology Development for Exoplanet Missions (TDEM)\nTechnology Development for Physics of the Cosmos Program (TPCOS)\nTechnology Development for the Cosmic Origins Program (TCOR)\n\nTechnology Development for Exoplanet Missions (TDEM) supports the maturation of key technologies to enable\nsearching out and characterizing extrasolar planets and planetary systems. TDEM solicits investigations that will\nundertake focused development of starlight suppression techniques and wavefront sensing and control technologies to\nenable direct detection of exoplanets (coronagraphy, external occulters, interferometry). Detailed discussions of the\ncurrent technology needs in the relevant areas can be found in the Exoplanet Exploration Program Technology Plan,\nwhich can be downloaded at http://exep.jpl.nasa.gov/reportsAndDocuments. Prospective SAT/TDEM proposers are\nstrongly encouraged to review this document before preparing their proposal, as it reflects the programmatic\nconsiderations that will be taken into consideration in the review and selection of TDEM submissions.\nTechnology Development for Physics of the Cosmos Missions (TPCOS) supports technology needed to enable missions\nwhich seek to understand the origin and destiny of the Universe, phenomena near black holes and the nature of gravity\n(missions directed at advancing the fields of cosmology, high-energy astrophysics and fundamental physics). TPCOS\nsolicits efforts to mature technologies for: (1) X-ray Astrophysics, including, but not limited to, high-resolution\nmicrocalorimeter arrays, lightweight replicated optics and precision structures, high-resolution gratings (both\ntransmission and reflection); (2) Gravitational Wave Astrophysics, including, but not limited to dimensionally stable,\noptical telescopes, frequency-stabilized metrology lasers, high-resolution phasemeters, low-noise microthrusters, ultraquiet inertial references, and long-distance laser metrology techniques; and (3) CMB Polarization Measurements,\nincluding, but not limited to, high-throughput cold mm-wave telescopes and large low-background multiplexed arrays of\ndetectors. Detailed discussions of current PCOS technology needs can be found in the PCOS Program Annual\nTechnology Report, which is available from the PCOS Program web site at http://pcos.gsfc.nasa.gov/. Prospective\nSAT/TPCOS proposers are urged to review this document before preparing their proposals.\nTechnology Development for the Cosmic Origins Program (TCOR) supports technology needed to investigate how\nplanets, stars, galaxies, and cosmic structure come into being and when and how the elements of life in the Universe\narose. Detailed discussions of current Cosmic Origin (COR) technology needs can be found in the COR Program\nAnnual Technology Report (PATR) at: http://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov. First and second priorities for areas of long-lead and\nmission enabling technology development that are of particular interest to the Cosmic Origins Program include: (1)\nhighly-sensitive large-array low-noise detectors from the extreme ultraviolet to the far-infrared; (2) improved broad-band\nreflective and anti-reflective ultraviolet optical coatings with particular emphasis on 90 to 130 nm; and (3) precision\nlarge optic, heterodyne receivers and cryocoolers.\nCOR missions rely heavily on their ability to collect enough light energy with appropriate angular resolution. Therefore,\na premium is placed on the ability to develop scalable manufacturing techniques, including the testing and control optics\nof sizes up to at least ~4 meters in diameter. Keys to advancements in this arena are new techniques and technologies\nfor reducing areal density of optics, production times, and cost; manufacturing ultra-precise, low-mass structures to\nreduce launch volume for large-aperture space telescopes and interferometers; operation at short wavelengths; and\nmechanisms and methods for improving control of the surface figure.\n\n6. SPACE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES\nThe Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) Space Technology Research Opportunities (STRO) program fosters the\ndevelopment of innovative, low-TRL technologies that have the potential to lead to dramatic improvements at the system\nlevel \xe2\x80\x93 performance, weight, cost, reliability, operational simplicity or other figures of merit associated with space flight\nhardware or missions. The goal of this low-TRL endeavor is to accelerate the development of groundbreaking, highrisk/high-payoff space technologies, not necessarily directed at a specific mission, to support the future space science\nand exploration needs of NASA, other government agencies, and the commercial space sector. Such efforts complement\nthe other NASA Mission Directorates\xe2\x80\x99 focused technology activities which typically begin at TRL 3 or higher. The TRL\nof the efforts to be funded as a result of this call will be TRL 1 or TRL 2 at the beginning of the selected effort and TRL\n2 or TRL 3 at the end of the effort. Proposals are solicited from accredited US universities. Typical award amounts are\n$250K per year for a maximum of two years.\n\nSPIE OptiFab Conference Paper 8884-501, 2013\n\nIn 2012, the STRO program solicited proposals for two optical technologies (in support of TABS 8.1.3): active\nwavefront control and grazing incidence optical systems.\nThe active wavefront control topic sought advanced technologies to enable a new generation of active space-based\noptical systems that sense and correct wavefront aberrations and mechanical misalignments caused by launch,\ndeployment and the thermal space environment. Larger space telescopes are required for future advances in astrophysics\nwhere a large collecting area and high angular resolution are needed to study faint and distant sources. Optical\ntelescopes with aperture sizes exceeding the dimensions of available launch vehicle fairings drive the need for\ndeployable mirror systems with extremely precise alignment tolerances. Technologies are needed that will enable\nautonomous alignment and phasing of next-generation large telescopes after deployment in space. Technologies that\nsimplify integration and reduce testing requirements during telescope development and that enable wavefront\nmodulation, such as starlight suppression, are of interest.\nThe grazing incidence optical system topic sought advanced technology to enable the manufacture mirror systems for\nnext generation x-ray astronomy missions which require an order of magnitude improvement in spatial resolution while\nmaintaining system mass at suitable levels. Technologies that enable precision fabrication, alignment, spacing, and\nreplication are sought. As an example, it is envisioned that future x-ray telescope systems will be comprised of\nthousands of mirror segments, driving the need for efficient, low-risk, cost-effective techniques for fabrication,\nmounting, and alignment of these systems. Advanced coatings, reflectors, and other technologies for directing and\nfocusing high-energy particles are of interest. Because mechanical misalignments in the telescope will result from the\nlaunch environment, changing gravitational conditions of orbit vs. ground-based fabrication and testing, and on-orbit\nthermal variations, technologies that enable active alignment and figure control of grazing-incidence optical system\nelements to correct these misalignments are of particular interest.\nIn 2013, the STRO program solicited proposals for \xe2\x80\x98Optical Coatings and Thin-film Physics\xe2\x80\x99 to identify and develop\nnovel optical coatings for high-reflection in the Lyman ultraviolet wavelengths which can be applied to >2 meter mirrors\nor for anti-reflections coatings at millimeter to far-infrared wavelengths which can be applied to >30 cm mirrors.\nThis topic sought to break new ground on advanced technologies (currently at TRL 1 or 2) for UV space-flight optical\ncoatings. Specifically, coatings are desired which have ~80% reflectivity across the Lyman ultraviolet or >97%\nreflectivity at 120-300 nm. The next generation of high-quantum efficiency (QE) detectors used in large focal plane\narrays demand accurate reflective and anti-reflective (AR) coatings capable of performing with minimal flux losses, free\nof scattering and polarization effects. Reflective coatings for visible and ultraviolet wavelengths have been in use for the\nlast 40 years. However, these coatings (e.g., LiF, MgF2, CaF2, LaF3), typically used with aluminum substrates, have\ndemonstrated serious, potentially insurmountable limitations, especially around shorter wavelengths such as the Lyman\xce\xb1 region (90 nm < \xce\xbb < 125 nm). The wealth of lines in the Lyman ultraviolet exceeds that in the rest of the UV and\nvisible combined, and yet this is a very understudied portion of the spectrum due to the low coating throughput. Better\ncoatings would make revolutionary discoveries in this wavelength range, including discovering the missing matter\naround galaxies and potentially characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets.\nAdditionally, future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) missions utilizing polarization-sensitive sensors demand\nAR coatings that can operate at cryogenic temperatures with high performance at wavelengths from the far-infrared to\nmillimeter. Coatings having low reflectance, low loss, and broad bandwidth, or with improved fabricability on highindex materials such as silicon and sapphire could improve optical designs for these missions.\nThe field of optical coatings demands disruptive solutions derived from first principles of thin-film physics. The current\nknown coatings materials and deposition techniques will not produce the performance and quality desirable to match the\nnext generation of high sensitivity detectors. The use of novel materials (for instance, using approaches such as\nplasmonic nanomaterials for the UV or metamaterials for the millimeter to far-infrared) can provide a radical advance to\nfill these needs. All SMD divisions require these solutions; however, Astrophysics is in more urgent need due to the\nfaint signals that must be measured to achieve the compelling science goals at UV and far-IR through millimeter\nwavelengths. Advances in these technologies will lead to the understanding of the first moments of the universe, the\ncharacterization of galaxy evolution across cosmic time, and the characterization of newly found exoplanets.\n\nSPIE OptiFab Conference Paper 8884-501, 2013\n\n7.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nPer the 2012 National Research Council \xe2\x80\x9cNASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities: Restoring NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nTechnological Edge and Paving the Way for a New Era in Space\xe2\x80\x9d, Optical System technology is required to meet several\nof NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Top Technical Challenges: next generation of large-aperture astronomical telescopes, lightweight laser\ncommunication systems, and high-performance orbiting observatories for planetary missions. And, two specific gamechanging capabilities were identified which require optical fabrication and testing technology development: lightweight\ngrazing-incidence optical systems for x-ray astronomy with spatial resolution < 0.1 arc-seconds; and normal-incidence\nmirrors with diameters of four meters and beyond that operate to wavelengths as low as 30 nm.\nAs defined in the \xe2\x80\x9cNASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan\xe2\x80\x9d, Scientific Instruments and Sensors technology\nis one of 7 Core Technologies indispensable for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s present and planned future missions. Over the next four years,\nNASA will invest in observatory technologies with improved performance and angular resolution, and reduced weight\nand cost. Specific emphasis will be on large mirror systems and structures. Potential large mirror investments include xray mirrors, lightweight mirrors, ultraviolet coatings and segmented mirrors.
