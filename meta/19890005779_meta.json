The software effort produced a series of trajectory programs covering low earth orbit (LEO) to various node locations, the node locations to the lunar surface, and then back to LEO. The surface operations study took a lunar scenario in the civil needs data base (CNDB) and attempted to estimate the amount of space-suit work or extravehicular activity (EVA) required to set up the base. The maintenance and supply options study was a first look at the problems of supplying and maintaining the base. A lunar surface launch and landing facility was conceptually designed. The lunar storm shelter study examined the problems of radiation protection. The lunar surface construction and equipment assembly study defined twenty surface construction and assembly tasks in detail.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890005779, "id": "7c829d6f09234a738e1336ebef5fe0b5", "publicationDate": "1988-10-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890005779.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890005779/downloads/19890005779.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890005779/downloads/19890005779.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890005779/downloads/19890005779.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
