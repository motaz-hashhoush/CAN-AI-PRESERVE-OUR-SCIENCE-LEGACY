Eliminating or reducing performance and safety problems can be achieved with a thorough understanding of potential failure modes in the design that lead to these problems. The majority of techniques use prior knowledge and experience as well as Failure Modes and Effects as methods to determine potential failure modes of aircraft. The aircraft design needs to be passed through a general technique to ensure that every potential failure mode is considered, while avoiding spending time on improbable failure modes. In this work, this is accomplished by mapping failure modes to certain components, which are described by their functionality. In turn, the failure modes are then linked to the basic functions that are carried within the components of the aircraft. Using the technique proposed in this paper, designers can examine the basic functions, and select appropriate analyses to eliminate or design out the potential failure modes. This method was previously applied to a simple rotating machine test rig with basic functions that are common to a rotorcraft. In this paper, this technique is applied to the engine and power train of a rotorcraft, using failures and functions obtained from accident reports and engineering drawings.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Canada", "submissionId": 20020087933, "endDate": "2002-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "5ce16f5041ee4a77b9d96f27ff107592", "id": "1c5ad1c2f6dc492bb7abdf45dee57e2e"}], "name": "Computers and Information in Engineering Conference", "location": "Montreal", "id": "5ce16f5041ee4a77b9d96f27ff107592", "startDate": "2002-09-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "Canada", "submissionId": 20020087933, "endDate": "2002-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "a436fc1f51d042358c20298120daf995", "id": "e9bdf776258d45119b8b989d17249990"}], "name": "ASME 2002 Design Engineering Technical Conference", "location": "Montreal", "id": "a436fc1f51d042358c20298120daf995", "startDate": "2002-09-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020087933, "id": "721fe89081f04c3fb792f6705e46ea05", "publicationDate": "2002-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020087933.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020087933/downloads/20020087933.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020087933/downloads/20020087933.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020087933/downloads/20020087933.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
