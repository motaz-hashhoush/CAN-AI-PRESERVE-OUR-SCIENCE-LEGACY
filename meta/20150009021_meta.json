In order to model a closed-volume variable ullage pressure tank, it was necessary to consider at least two separate cases: a vertical cylinder, and a sphere. Using library components, it was possible to construct a rough model for the cylindrical tank. It was not possible to construct a model for a spherical tank, using library components, due to the variable area. It was decided that, for these cases, it would be preferable to create a custom library component to represent each case, using the Simscape language. Once completed, the components were added to models, where filling and draining the tanks could be simulated. When the models were performing as expected, it was necessary to generate code from the models and run them in Trick (a real-time simulation program). The data output from Trick was then compared to the output from Simscape and found to be within acceptable limits.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150009021, "id": "45faa8c06f6c45c7bd132aaae0dc900d", "publicationDate": "2015-03-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150009021.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150009021/downloads/20150009021.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150009021/downloads/20150009021.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150009021/downloads/20150009021.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
