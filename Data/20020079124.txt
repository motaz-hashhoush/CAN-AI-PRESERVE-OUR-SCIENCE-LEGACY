b"Transportation\n\nRobotic Wateriet Sqstems\n=late\n1970s, before the Space Shuttle\nmade its flight debut, NASA recognized a\nproblem in the fact that the Shuttle's two solid\nrocket boosters were reusable; they were\ndesigned to operate for two minutes on a\nShuttle mission, then separate and drop\nEarthward to a parachute-softened splash in\nthe ocean for recovery and refurbishment.\nThe problem lay in the refurbishment process:\nhow to strip away multiple layers of tough,\nremoval-resistant paint and thermal protection\nmaterial, and do it in such a manner that the\nbooster's casing would not be damaged.\nClearly, NASA saw, something substantially\nmore advanced than conventional manual\nstripping would be required.\nMarshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) teamed\nwith United Technologies' USBI Company,\nHuntsville, Alabama, NASA's contractor for\nbooster refurbishment, to develop an advanced\nstripping system based on hydroblasting, or\nhigh pressure waterjet cleaning. To compress\neight years of complex research and innovative\ndevelopment into a paragraph, the NASA/\nUSBI team developed a waterjet capable of\nslicing through the thermal protection material and blowing away the particles; found a way\nThe Ship ARMS Decoating\nSystem employs a high\npressure water pump to *\ns\nunwanted coatingsfi.om large\nships and other vessels.\n\n''\n\nto regulate the jet stream to strip paint and\nprimer beneath the outer protective coating,\none layer at a time; and developed a computerdirected six degrees of freedom robot for\nprecise control of the waterjet, in order to\nprevent damage to the casing. The end result\nwas a system that could strip a booster in a\nfraction of the time required by manual\nmethods.\nThis technological solution and its subsequent\ncommercialization is a prime example of high\nvalue spinoff from aerospace technology (in\nthis case NASA and, later, Department of\nDefense technology). It is an example of a\ntechnology transfer that not only resulted in\nformation of a new company, but also spawned\na whole new industry. The innovative technology offers a broad range of benefits to maintenance and overhaul organizations in cost and\ntime savings, worker protection and a variety of\nenvironmental protection advantages.\nUnited Technologies Corporation took advantage of the apparent commercial potential of\nthe system by investing company funds in\nrefining the NASA/USBI technology, advancing it in new directions, and-in January\n\n1993-establishing a company to commercialize and market the technology. The company is\nWaterjet Systems, Inc., Huntsville, Alabama,\noperated by United Technologies' Pratt &\nWhitney division. Waterjet Systems pursued the\nmilitary potential of the technology under an\nAir Force MANTECH (manufacturing technology transfer) program to adapt the boosterstripping technology to large aircraft, then\nextended the technology to ships through a\nNavy MANTECH program.\n\n\\\n\nWith these and other extensions of the technology, Waterjet $stems established a family of\nhydroblast systems under the general designation ARMSm(Automated Robotic Maintenance\nSystems). Generally, they employ high pressure\nwater pumps to create waterblast streams at\n55,000 pounds per square inch that are controlled by target sensitive robots maneuvering\nprecisely over one-of-a-kind surfaces. The\nARMS family includes:\nAircraft ARMSm.The first application of\nAircraft ARMS, a fully automated version\nderived from the NASA/USBI technology and\nrefined under the Air Force MANTECH\nprogram, is the LARPS (Large Aircraft Robotic\nPaint Stripping) system for Air Force use.\nIntroduced to operational service in 1995, its\ngoals are to reduce stripping time by 50\npercent and use of hazardous chemicals by 90\npercent. Aircraft ARMS systems are designed\nfor painting and depainting commercial as well\nas military aircraft.\n\nI,\nI\nI\n\nShip ARMS'. The Ship ARMS Decoating\nSystem was designed for use on large ships,\nboats, barges, floating drydocks and other\nvessels. It is a semiautomated, totally mobile\nsystem that includes a trailer-based high\npressure high flow water pump, a precision\ncomputer-designed nozzle and a specialized\nrobotic manipulator and end effector. The\nsystem not only strips a ship's multilayer\nanticorrosion and antifoulant coatings, one\nlayer at a time, but also captures all process\neffluent; a specially designed vacuum shroud\nand water recovery/reuse system collects\nstripped materials and prevents hazardous\nmaterials from running off into the water or\nonto the dock. The U.S. Navy was the first\n\ncustomer; the process has been demonstrated\non the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and two other\nships. Among a lengthy list of benefits are\nenvironmental gains, such as no airborne\nparticles, reduced waste disposal, reduced ecoimpact, and cost-related gains, such as no need\nfor scaffolding or masking, shorter strip and\ndrydock time, and less cleanup.\nEngine ARMSm.Turbine engine parts-vanes,\ncombustors, blades, for example-have a\nvariety of coatings to protect them from the\nhot operating environment. At overhaul time,\nthe engine is disassembled and the parts are\nstripped of their coatings, customarily by acid\nbath and grit blasting, processes that are both\nlabor intensive and hazardous to personnel.\nEngine ARMS does the job faster and cheaper\nwith bonuses in reduction of toxic chemicals:\nwaste disposal and human protection\nequipment.\nComponent ARMSm.Components in this sense\nmeans major segments of aircraft or military/\nindustrial systems. Among examples that can\nbe decoated by Component ARMS are engine\ncowlings, rudders, flaps, radomes, helicopter\nblades, horizontal\nstabilizers, tail cones\nand small vehicles\n(Humvees, armored\npersonnel carriers,\ntanks, etc.).\n@ARMS,\nAircraft ARMS, Engine\nARMS, Ship ARMS and Component\nARMS are registered trademarks of\nUnited Technologies Corporation.\n\nThe decoating system can\nreach high sufaces,\neliminating the need for\nscaffolding.\n\n"
