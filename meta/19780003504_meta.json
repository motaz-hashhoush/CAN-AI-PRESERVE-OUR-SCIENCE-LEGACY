It was established that reliable estimates of sand and coastal scrub areas can be determined from LANDSAT image classification by the Vec classifier more economically than by conventional means from a map of the coastal zone produced by photointerpretation using 1:10,000 aerial photography. Current LANDSAT imagery is also suitable for monitoring for large scale storm damage to the zone, but the normal change in sand areas extent due to man's activity or other reasons, is about 5 to 10 m per year, occasionally being as great as 30 m per year, so that it is considered that LANDSAT D will have the resolution necessary to monitor these changes but not current imagery.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780003504, "id": "90e5b5cfa13f4809b6d0ba2b399b8002", "publicationDate": "1977-01-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780003504.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780003504/downloads/19780003504.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780003504/downloads/19780003504.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780003504/downloads/19780003504.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
