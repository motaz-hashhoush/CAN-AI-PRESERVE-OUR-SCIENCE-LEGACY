The main part of the image algorithm was the subtraction of two consecutive images using software. For a nominal size image of 256 x 256 pixels this subtraction can take a large portion of the time between successive frames in standard rate video leaving very little time for other computations. The purpose of this project was to integrate the software subtraction into hardware to speed up the subtraction process and allow for more complex algorithms to be performed, both in hardware and software.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000011914, "id": "3bd1475acc8f45bfba3d82753689af61", "publicationDate": "1999-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000011914.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000011914/downloads/20000011914.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000011914/downloads/20000011914.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000011914/downloads/20000011914.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
