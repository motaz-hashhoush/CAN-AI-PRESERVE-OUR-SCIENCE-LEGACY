b'EXPLORATION MEDICAL SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION PROJECT\nD.A. Rubin1, S.D. Watkins2\n1\nWyle Science, Technology, and Engineering Group, Houston, Texas; 2Universities Space Research Association,\nHouston, Texas.\nBACKGROUND\nExploration class missions will present significant new challenges and hazards to the health of the astronauts.\nRegardless of the intended destination, beyond low Earth orbit a greater degree of crew autonomy will be required to\ndiagnose medical conditions, develop treatment plans, and implement procedures due to limited communications\nwith ground-based personnel.\nSCOPE\nThe Exploration Medical System Demonstration (EMSD) project will act as a test bed on the International Space\nStation (ISS) to demonstrate to crew and ground personnel that an end-to-end medical system can assist clinician\nand non-clinician crew members in optimizing medical care delivery and data management during an exploration\nmission. Challenges facing exploration mission medical care include limited resources, inability to evacuate to Earth\nduring many mission phases, and potential rendering of medical care by non-clinicians. This system demonstrates\nthe integration of medical devices and informatics tools for managing evidence and decision making and can be\ndesigned to assist crewmembers in nominal, non-emergent situations and in emergent situations when they may be\nsuffering from performance decrements due to environmental, physiological or other factors.\nPROJECT OBJECTIVES\nThe objectives of the EMSD project are to:\na.\n\nReduce or eliminate the time required of an on-orbit crew and ground personnel to access, transfer, and\nmanipulate medical data.\n\nb.\n\nDemonstrate that the on-orbit crew has the ability to access medical data/information via an intuitive and\ncrew-friendly solution to aid in the treatment of a medical condition.\n\nc.\n\nDevelop a common data management framework that can be ubiquitously used to automate repetitive data\ncollection, management, and communications tasks for all activities pertaining to crew health and life\nsciences.\n\nd.\n\nEnsure crew access to medical data during periods of restricted ground communication.\n\ne.\n\nDevelop a common data management framework that allows for scalability, extensibility, and\ninteroperability of data sources and data users.\n\nf.\n\nLower total cost of ownership for development and sustainment of peripheral hardware and software that\nuse EMSD for data management.\n\ng.\n\nProvide a better standard of healthcare for crew members through reductions in the time required by crew\nand ground personnel to provide medical treatment and the number of crew errors experienced during\ntreatment.\n\n'
