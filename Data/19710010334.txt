Clark\n\nDepartment of Aerospace and Mechanical Sciences\n\nPrinceton University2 Princeton, New Jersey\n\n(NGL 31-001-005)\n\nA series of basic experiments has demonstrated that pulsed\n\nplasma accelerators can attain quasi-steady operation in a few\n\ntens of microseconds when provided with suitably protracted and\n\n1- 5\n This\n\nsynchronized inputs of driving current and mass flow.\nquasi-steady mode is characterized by stationary, diffuse dis\xc2\xad\ncharge current .patterns, constant terminal voltage, and constant\n\nexhaust velocity in a range encouraging propulsion application.\n\nSuch devices are thus of interest both as pulsed plasma thrusters,\n\nand as laboratory simulators of the corresponding steady flow ac\xc2\xad\ncelerators in power ranges where the latter cannot be conveniently\n\nstudied in steady operation.\n\nFor example, Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a quasi\xc2\xad\nsteady accelerator employing a coaxial electrode configuration\n\nlike that of the conventional magnetoplasmadynamic arc. Mass flow\n\nis provided by a gasdynamic shock tube which can very rapidly pro\xc2\xad\nduce a high pressure reservoir behind suitable injector orifices.\n\nArc current is derived from an array of capacitors and inductors\n\nwhich, depending on the particular configuration, provide rectan\xc2\xad 8\n\n6gular pulses from 4000 amp x 600 psec to 140,000 amp x 20 psec.\n\nThe corresponding range of arc power--100 kW to 100 MW--is com\xc2\xad\nmensurate with relatively large arc chamber dimensions, which in\n\nturn permits more detailed study of the discharge structure than\n\nwould be possible in smaller scale facilities.\n\nA considerable variety of diagnostic studies have been\n\nperformed in this facility and in other related apparatus involving\n\nKerr-cell photography, electric and magnetic probing, velocity\n\nfield mapping, spectroscopy, laser interferometry, and terminal\n\nmeasurements of current, voltage and mass flow. From these an in\xc2\xad\nstructive, yet incomplete, picture of the arc operation begins to\n\nemerge. Figure 2 shows a series of Kerr-cell photographs of arc\n\nluminosity at a given current for three different mass flows: one\n\nmatched to the current value in terms of the classical DPD arc cri\xc2\xad\nteria, the others representing conditions of mass "starvation" and\n\n"overfeed," respectively. The importance of matching the mass\n\nflow to the arc current is demonstrated here and in many other ex\xc2\xad\nperiments2 2 most notably in a tendency for underfed arcs to erode\n\nelectrode and insulator material.\n\nFigure 3a displays the distribution of current within a\n\n17,500 amp argon arc as determined by magnetic probing. Two par\xc2\xad\nticularly significant features are the participation of the entire\n\n\n9\n\ncathode surface in the discharge, which should minimize the ero\xc2\xad\nsion of that surface, and the rather small protraction of the\n\ncurrent pattern downstream of the anode orifice in contrast to\n\nexperience with external field MPD accelerators. 9 - 1 2 \n Fig\xc2\xad\nthe \t\n3\nure \t b shows contours of floating potential for the same arc op\xc2\xad\neration. Roughly, this pattern consists of four domains of sig\xc2\xad\n(a) a 10-20-volt anode fall , (b) a 20\xc2\xad\nnificant potential drop:\nvolt cathode falls (c) a drop roughly equal to the ionization po\xc2\xad\ntential across the injected gas jets, and (d) a 100-volt envelope\n\naround the cathode. Of these, it is the last which dominates the\n\npotential pattern, and probably holds the key to the performance\n\nrange and efficiency of this type of accelerator.\n\nTime-of-flight velocity measurements made downstream with\n\nbiased double probes yield values inconsistent with any simple\n\nelectrostatic acceleration model based on the potential pat\xc2\xad\nterns. 1 3 For the sample case of Fig. 3, centerline ion speeds\n\nof the order of 25,000 m/sec are found, which imply ion energies\n\nof some 150 eV, and are therefore far above the difference between\n\nthe anode and downstream plasma potentials, far above the Alfv~n\n\ncritical value, 1 4 and, in fact, comparable to the full interelec\xc2\xad\ntrode potential. Apparently some complex but effective electro\xc2\xad\nmagnetic-electrothermal conversion process functions within or\n\njust downstream of the cathode potential envelope. Small wedges\n\nplaced in this flow indicate that it is substantially supersonic,\n\nand that the ion temperature is of the order of 10 eV.\n\nWhile the full import of these various observations is not\n\nclear, the prognosis for efficient gas acceleration by this quasi\xc2\xad\nsteady technique seems favorable. Repetitive pulse operation of\n\nthrusters of this type should combine the advantages of the high\xc2\xad\npower arc operation with tolerable mean power requirements and\n\n15\nSystems\n\nvariable thrust capability via duty-cycle adjustment.\nof power\xc2\xad\naspects of this concept, including the major problems\nconditioning and mass injection are also under basic study in\n\nthis program, along with the development of suitable techniques\n\n1 6\n\nfor assessing the performance of thrusters of this type.\nReferences\n\n1. \tClark, K.

Michels, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nThe investigation of the voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of a\n\npulsed, megawatt, MPD-arc is described for various amplitudes of\n\nauxiliary magnetic field (0.5 to 2.0 T). The pulsed arc is powered\n\nby a crowbarred capacitor bank and the data is dynamically gathered\n\nfor a hundred microseconds after the voltage and current traces have\n\nstabilized. The tungsten cathode is heated to emitting condition\n\njust prior to powering the arc. A puff of argon or nitrogen gas is\n\nadmitted into the evacuated arc chamber and allowed to distribute\n\nprior to powering the arc. From cold flow transient pressure traces,\n\nthe time to power the arc is determined, as well as the chamber pres\xc2\xad\nsure at firing time. The experinents were operated for two different\n\nweight flows through the arc annulus, 6.0 g/sec-and 1.5 g/sec.\n\nThe gross physical processes, such as the V-i characteristics, imped\xc2\xad\nances, and plume characteristics described in this paper, are part of\n\nthe means of identifying these arcs in relation to the varied forms\n\nof arcs in the literature. This paper extends the knowledge to the\n\n0.2-2.5 megawatt level. Spoking instabilities are not noted for these\n\npower levels and time durations.\n\nThe V-I characteristic obtained for each shot shows a positive-sloped,\n\ncurvilinear trend. A series of these characteristics, for currents\n\nfrom 2 to 14 kA, shows them to be dynamic characteristics (as defined\n\nin Ref. 1) and not connected curves. A static characteristic curve\n\ncan be estimated from the family of dynamic characteristic curves. As\n\nthe magnetic field is increased, the dynamic curves, although still\n\ncurvilinear, tend to be more identifiable as part of a connected curve.\n\nFor instance, at 20 kG, the dynamic curves are almost part of the esti\xc2\xad\nmated linear static characteri-stic curves. That is, the increased field\n\nhas made the arc system almost resistor-like and the short duration\n\npulsed operation is sufficient to obtain static V-I characteristics.\n\nPositive sloped static characteristics for higher arc current cases are\n\nobserved as suggested in Ref. I.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nI J. D.

Ducati\n\nPlasmadyne, a division of Geotel, Inc.\n\nSanta Ana, California\n\n(NAS 1-9297)\n\nRecent work ( 1 , 2, 3) has been concerned with obtaining an improved\nunderstanding of MPD thruster operation including pulsed (quasi-steady)(4 , 5)\nas well as continuous arc devices. A large fraction of the effort has fo\xc2\xad\ncussed on evaluating the effect of ambient conditions on the measured per\xc2\xad\nformance. It has been demonstrated that ambient gas is entrained in a\nregion of the plume that forms a part of the arc path and can therefore be\nsubject to electromagnetic forces.\nUsing a large insulating vacuum tank it was found to be possible to\ndetect the flow of charged particles in the plume utilizing a large coil\nwrapped around the test chamber to introduce changes in the ambient mag\xc2\xad\nnetic field strength. The field deflects portions of the plume which carry\ncharged particles (as distinguished from excited particles). The phenome\xc2\xad\nnon was observed in the insulated tank as well as a nonmagnetic metal tank,\nindicating that large scale current flow paths in the plune do not depend on\na return flow path through the tank. Other observations6) show evidence\nof a flow of electrons returning in an annular path to the anode with suffi\xc2\xad\ncient intensity to cause severe heating of the exterior anode face. These\nresults provide evidence that a significant fraction of the arc current fol\xc2\xad\nlows a path in the luminous plume outside of the thruster.\nTo evaluate the rate of entrainment of ambient gas in the excited\nportion of the plume, tests were made with hydrogen as the working fluid\nand with an additional flow of hydrogen or some other gas introduced di\xc2\xad\nrectly into the test chamber. It was found that the arc voltage is strongly\ndependent on both the ambient pressure and the type of ambient gas used\n(although a constant arc chamber pressure is maintained, and the propel\xc2\xad\nlant gas is not changed). Also, the color of the plume depends on the en\xc2\xad\nvironmental gas (apparently even at the center of the jet).\nThese observations suggest that the jet mixes very rapidly with the\nsurrounding gas, and strongly indicate that a large fraction of the arc en\xc2\xad\nergy is expended on ambient gas mixed witlvpropellant in the plume. The\nrapid mixing is confirmed by another stidy ) in which detailed surveys\nwere made to determine the flow pattern in the vicinity of a small jet in a\nvacuum chamber. This work also indicates that more rapid entrainment\nrates can be expected as pressure is reduced as long as continuum flow\nconditions predominate. A clear cut evaluation of entrainment effects ap\xc2\xad\npears to require very precise measurement of thrust for a range of ambi\xc2\xad\nent pressures in the molecular flow regime. For steady operation this is\nonly possible with very small thrusters; and has not yet been accomplished,\neven though a sizable effort has been expended toward this end. It is con\xc2\xad\ncluded that we are not yet able to predict the performance of continuous\n(steady) MPD thrusters in space from laboratory tests.\n\n17\n\nOn the other hand, quasi-steady MPD thrusters appear to offer a\nbetter opportunity fcr obtaining performance data in ambient conditions ap\xc2\xad\nproaching those in space. The test chamber can be thoroughly evacuated\nbefore triggering a pulse. No interference will be felt until the pulse front\nreaches the chamber wall and is reflected back to the vicinity of the thruster.\nInterference free periods hundreds of microseconds long can be obtained\nin this manner in test chambers of moderate size. During this interval\nthe-thrust level can be high enough to produce an impulse that can be read\xc2\xad\nfly measured.\nAnother important reason for investigating performance in the\nquasi-steady mode is that MPD thrusters show progressively better per\xc2\xad\nformance as the power level is increased. Since much higher power levels\ncan be handled in momentary.pulses than would be feasible with steady\noperation, strong interest has developed in determining the performance\nattainable with quasi-steady MPD thrusters. However, performance has\nnot yet been determined accurately enough to establish the degree of corre\xc2\xad\nlation with theoretical models or with steady state performance.\nWork has been initiated for determining the performance of quasi\xc2\xad\nsteady arc jets operating at energies as high as 20, 000 joules per pulse.\nThese devices typically operate for a large fraction of a millisecond and at\npower levels measured in megawatts during a pulse. The investigation is\nconcentrating on the use of solid and liquid propellants which are vaporized\nby the action of the arc. A critical design problem which is being actively\nstudied is the choice of a feed system that will provide propellant at the\nproper rate to match the power pulse, and avoid wasteful expenditure of\npropellant. The problem is complex because it involves the power pulse\nshape and the electrode design as well as the propellant- properties and the\npropellant feed system itself.\nSome refined instrumentation is required to accurately determine\nthe performance of quasi-steady thrusters. For precisely measuring small\nvalues of thrust, a torsional ballistic pendulum is being developed. The\ncomplete pulse generating circuit is mounted on the thrust platform so that\nthe connecting leads can be reduced to instrumentation and control lines\nand light power leads for recharging the condensers. Qther equipment used\nincludes a high speed motion picture camera to record the growth and tail\xc2\xad\noff of the plume, a spectroscope which is used to obtain data on the material\nin the plume by repeatedly exposing the same film during successive pulses\nuntil an adequate record is obtained, and various probes for determining\nconditions in the plume.\nAn effort will be made to establish trade-off factors which will per\xc2\xad\nmit a reatsonable choice to be made of design variables such as thruster\ngeometry, size, duty cycle, and propellant; and tests will be made at a\nrange of vacuum levels to see if performance is affected by ambient pres\xc2\xad\nsure to a measurable degree.\n\n18\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \t\n\nDucati, A.

Hoell, J. Burlock, and 0. Jarrett\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nPerformance data obtained for d.c. MPD thrusters during the past few\n\nyears have indicated an efficiency increase with power. To verify and\n\nexploit this trend, the power applied to d.c. arcs has been extended to the\n\nlimit of conventional electrode capability and, even more important, beyond\n\nthe capacity of forseeable space-rated power supplies. The short pulse mode\n\nof operation (i.e. pulses of 1 to 10 vs duration) which has been studied by\n\na number of laboratories solves the electrode problems and when repetitively\n\npulsed permits use of average powers well below space-rated power supply\n\ncapabilities. However, this mode of operation has had problems concerning\n\nproper matching of the propellant distribution with the short current pulse.\n\nAn alternate mode of operation which takes advantage of the increasing\n\nefficiency with power associated with the true steady state MPD arc and\n\nwith repetitive pulsing provides the low average input power condition of\n\nthe short pulsed mode is a mode of operation, designated as "quasi-steady"\n\n(Q.S.) I . In this mode a high current pulse and a propellant pulse are applied\nfor periods of time which are long enough to allow important parameters to\nreach steady state, i.e., ,. 1 msec. This note will describe research which has\nbeen underway at Langley during the past few months to develop a Q.S. MPD\nthruster and to spectroscopically measure the velocity distribution in a Q.S.\n\nthruster.\n\nThe MPD arc used during these tests is a hollow cathode device which has\n\nbeen operated at Langley for a number of years. The cathode is a barium impreg\xc2\xad\nnated tungsten tube 2 inches long by one-quarter inch O.D. by one-eighth inch\n\nI.D. The anode is a copper-tungsten ring with a 1 inch I.D. and 32-1/16 inch\n\nO.D. gas-feed holes around the circumferance. A block diagram of the elec\xc2\xad\ntrical circuit is shown in figure 1. The Q.S. power supply is coupled to the\n\nelectrodes through an impedance matching transformer designed to work into a\n\nload of 0.14 2. Operating into a properly matched load this power supply is\n\ncapable of a square wave output of 1 megawatt for 1 msec with a rise and fall\n\ntime of approximately 50 us. Using the circuit shown in figure 1, the arc\n\ncan be operated with or without a D.C. current and with or without an external\n\nB-field before applying a Q.S. current pulse. The time control block consists\n\nof several time-delay generators which are used to synchronize the Q.S. current\n\npulse with the spectrograph shutter, the D.C. arc, and the gas pulse.\n\nIn developing a Q.S. thruster, the first component considered was the\n\nQ.S. power supply. Of equal importance, however, is the gas-feed system and\nthe region of gas injection. Using the present NPD arc, gas can be injected\nfrom three different positions: (1) through the hollow cathode, (2) through\nthe anode, and (3) between the electrodes. Tests have been made using the\nfirst two methods. A fast-acting gas value capable of producing a gas pulse\nwith a rise time of \'t 100 ps and a duration of several millisec. was used to\nintroduce the gas into the arc chamber. The rise time of gas pulse for both\n\n\n20\n\n\ncathode and anode injection was approximately 5 0 0 -ps. The light intensity\n\nproduced by the 4806.017 R line of argon was used as a measure of the\n\neffectiveness of gas injection from a particular position. It was found\n\nthat when the propellant was injected through the anode, the light intensity\n\nfrom the 4806.017 R line increased by approximately a factor of 5 over that\n\nfor cathode injection. This suggests that for the latter case most of the\n\ngas was missing the discharge. A similar test is planned for injection\n\nbetween the electrodes.\n\nIt is of some concern in the development of a Q.S. thruster whether or\n\nnot "quasi-steady" thermionic emission from the cathode exists during the\n\ncurrent pulse as this relates to cathode life time, efficiency, and dupli\xc2\xad\ncation of the steady MPD mode. As a check on the emission from the cathode,\n\nexperiments were made in which the pulsed current and voltage was measured\n\nfor first a hot cathode and then a cold cathode. For the hot cathode case\n\nthe Q.S. pulse was applied nu 20 millisec. after a d.c. arc of 40 amps used\n\nto heat the cathode was extinguished. Figure 2 shows the current and voltage\n\ntraces for these two conditions as well as for the condition of hot and cold\n\ncathode with B = 620 g. It can be seen that even for a pulse current of only\n\n2000 A there is no measurable difference between a hot and cold cathode for\n\nthe same external field; there is, however, considerable difference between\n\nthe case of B # 0 and B = 0.\n\nA major part of the Q.S. program at Langley consists of spectroscopically\nmeasuring the exhaust velocity from a Q.S. thruster. For d.c. operation\naccurate measurements are relatively straightforward using a spectrograph with\na resolution of 0.03 R or better.2 For pulsed operation the major obstacle\nis insufficient light for good exposure for each pulse; consequently, for the\npulsed powers that have been used to date, it has been necessary to use from\nthree to six pulsed exposures per plate. The preliminary results that have\nbeen obtained have qualitatively demonstrated that just as the region of pro\xc2\xad\npellant injection is important (see above) so is the uniformity of gas distri\xc2\xad\nbution. For example, figure 3 shows a radial distribution of the axial velocity\nwhich exhibits a radial gradient in axial velocity. The assymmetry in the\naxial velocity corresponds to an assymmetry that has been measured in the pulsed\ngas distribution. The unfavorable propellant distribution is due to the use of\na single valve to inject gas from one side of the anode. To eliminate this\nnonuniformity in the velocity distribution a more uniform gas injection system\nis being designed; extensive surveys of velocity distribution will be made for\nthis system.\nReferences\n\n1. \tClark, Kenn E.: Quasi-Steady Plasma Acceleration.\nReport 859, May 1969.\n\n\nPrinceton University\n\n\n2. \t\nKogelschatz, U.: Doppler Shift Measurements of Axial and Rotational\n\nVelocities in an MPD Arc.

C. Malliaris and D. B, Libby\nApplied Technology Division, Avco Corporation,\nWilmington, Massachusetts\n\nThe acceleration of a partially ionized gas by electromagnetic\n\nmeans might be quite inefficient, if the coupling between the ions\n\nand thejaeutrals, for momentum transfer, is weak. Poor efficiency\nmay arise from large velocity disparities between ions and neutrals\nin the same plasma flow. In the work reported here the absence or\npresence of a sufficiently strong coupling is generally revealed by\nvelocity disparities determined spectroscopically, for several species,\nboth ionic and neutral. Velocities are determined by Doppler shift\nmeasurements of selected spectral lines. Such lines are obtained not\nonly from species which occur naturally in the main propellant, but also\nfrom any desired additives.\n\nResults regarding two different situations are being obtained,\nfrom experiments where two basically similar axisymmetric configurations\noperate under significantly different conditions. In the first case, a\nlarge disparity in ion-neutral velocities is observed, while in the\nsecond case the said disparity disappears. In this second case, the\ncommon ion-neutral velocities are in good agreement with the center-of\xc2\xad\nmass velocity, as determined independently from measurements of motion\xc2\xad\nally induced potentials in the flow, as well as from measurements, of\nthe local momentum and mass fluxes.\nA satisfactory interpretation of the results is obtained when the\ncalculated mean free path for momentum exchange is compared with a\ntypical dimension of the electromagnetic acceleration region.\nA detailed paper will be presented at the AIAA 8th Aerospace\n\nSciences Meeting, New York, N. Y., January 1970.\n\n\nWork supported by NASA/LaRC Contract NAS 1-9298\n\n\n25\n\nNEUTRAL DENSITY MEASUREMENTS IN AN NH3 MPD ARC\n\nPer Gloersen, General Electric-Space Sciences Lab, King of Prussia, Penna.\n\n\nThe program described in this paper was to determine exrerimentally the\n\nrange of applicability of a vacuum ultraviolet absorption spectrometry tech\xc2\xad\nnique to detecting neutral atom and molecule constituents in the exhaust stream\n\nof an MPD arc jet. Specifically, emphasis was on measuring the nitrogen atom\n\ndensities in an ammonia-fueled MPD arc jet exhaust. To date, no other tech\xc2\xad\nniques have been established for measuring this quantity, possibly important for\n\nthe corroboration of arc jet propulsion efficiency figures ob tained from thrust\n\nand input mass flow measurements. An analysis is presented for the reduction\n\nof transmissivity data in terms of nitrogen atom flow rates. The main purpose\n\nof this program was to establish the experimental technique for this new appli\xc2\xad\ncation; more systematic use of this technique to help determine the operating\n\ncharacteristics of the NH 3 MPD arc would be undertaken in subsequent programs.\n\nThe light source used in these studies consisted of an air-cooled quartz\n\ncapillary through which nitrogen flowed. A 250 micron slit was placed at the\n\nvacuum chamber end of this tube to permit higher operating pressures in the\n\ntube than are maintained in the vacuum test chamber. Excitation is achieved in\n\na tuned cavity driven by a 2.145 KC, 125 watt oscillator. The background light\n\nsource produced a 1200 R nitrogen atom line received in the spectrometer, re\xc2\xad\nflected from a freshly coated mirror, some 15 times brighter than that received\n\ndirectly from the arc in ammonia; thus, meaningful absorption measurements were\n\nreadily accomplished.\n\n\nThe arc was constructed according to plans supplied by Langley Research\n\nCenter and is identical with one of the configurations used in a number of\n\nexperiments. Absorption measurements were made at a downstream position in\n\nthe arc plume about 52 cm from the external nozzle (see Figure 1). The flow\n\nrange covered was from 6-18 mg/sec. The arc was operated at 300 amperes and\n\n63-80 volts dc, depending on the flow rate. The magnetic field was maintained\n\nat 5000 gauss for all of the runs. Observed transmissivity (I/Io) of the arc\n\nunder these conditions is indicated in Figure 2, along with similar data for\n\nthe cold ammonia flow with the arc power turned off.\n\nUnder the conditions of the present experiment, the background emission\n\nline is much narrower than the absorption line in the arc plume, principally\n\nbecause of the symmetrical Doppler broadening due to the arc plume spreading.\n\nTherefore, the only useful part of the absorption coefficient, k (V), is at the\n\nline center, which we shall call k o . Thus, one can immediately write the ex\xc2\xad\npression for the integrated absorption as\n\n\nI/I\nSolving for the unknown,\n\nn\n\n=\n\n= e\n\n-k nL\n\n0\n\n(1/koL) in (Io/I)\n\n(2)\n(2)\n\n26\n\nwhere, for a Doppler-broadened line,\n\ncf\ne ef \n /tanc(,\n\n\nk\n\nand\n\nr\n\n13 cm,\n= 2.82 x 10 -\n\n\nc= 3 x 1010 cm/sec,\n\n\nQ< is the half angle of spreading in the exhaust\n= 1200 A,\nf = 0.35,\nplume and V as the average axial velocity of the absorbing species in the\nplume. The total rate of flow of the absorbing species is given by\nN = nAV7 = (W16\n\nre\n\nf\n\n) -2 Ltanein (Io/I)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the radius of the cross-sectional area A has been taken as L/4. &(was taken\n\nto be 200, as defined by the arc position and baffle aperture. It should be\n\nnoted, however, that the visual appearance of the arc plume was indicative\n\npossibly of a somewhat smaller angle. Based on Kogelschatz\'s results from his\n\nDoppler shift measurements in a similar arc,V for the nitrogen atom is taken\n\nto be 3 x 105 cm/sec. over the operating range covered here. Two things\n\nshould be noted in this regard. First, the range of operating conditions in\n\nthese experiments extended to lower flow rates than those of Kogelschatz; it\n\nnoted by him extends also to\n\nis assumed that the constancy of the velocity\nthe lower flow rates. Second, Kogelsehatz\'s observations involve the-luminous\n\nnitrogen atoms whereas these experiments involve the ground state atoms. In\n\nview of the short radiative lifetime of the atomic states, it is assumed that\n\nthe excited atoms observed by him resulted from re-excitation in the exhaust\n\nplume as a consequence of the extended currents from the arc. It therefore\n\nseems reasonable to assume that the excited and ground state atoms are moving\n\nwith the same average velocity.\n\n\nUsing these data and assumptions, Equation 3 can be evaluated for a number\n\nof different operating conditions. The results are shown in Figure 3. It can\n\nbe seen that maximum fractional amount of ammonia observed in the plume was\n\nabout 1.5% and that this fraction is almost independent of flow rate. The\n\nabsolute accuracy of these results is no better than the + 50% available for\n\nthe oscillator strength, f, and depends also heavily on the assumed appli\xc2\xad\ncability of the value used for 7. Thus, if the velocity of the non-luminous\n\nnitrogen atoms were significantly higher than observed by Kogelschatz for the\n\nluminous ones, the role of these consituents could be converted from minor to\n\nmajor.\n\n\nWork performed under Contract No. NASI-8461\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\nOptical Arrangement for Vacuum Ultraviolet Measurements\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nXC-l\n\n0.9\n\n018\n\nIonization gauge\nreading (microns):\n\n0.6\n\nPotential drop\nacross are\n(volts):\n80\n\n65\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n65\n\n0,4\n\n64\n\n64\n\noe\n\nt-4\n\n0.7\n\nH\n\nNc\n\nN\n\n06\n\n300,\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n\n8\nAMMONIA FLOW RATE\n\n12\n\n-- Milligrams per second\n\nFigure 2.\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n3%\n\nI\n\nI = 300 amps\n2%\n\nB = 5000 gauss\n\nWO\n\nI%;\n\n_\n\n-\n\n4\xc2\xad\n\n--\xc2\xad\n\n0\n4\n\n6\n\n8\nAMMONIA FLOW RATE\n\n10\n\n12\n--\n\n14\n\n16\n\nMilligrams per second\n\nFigure 3.

Seikel, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nThis presentation will briefly review the various phases of Lewis\' MPD\n\narc thruster program including: (1) low power (l0 to 1000 W) radia\xc2\xad\ntion cooled thruster; (2) 30 kW radiation cooled NH3 thruster; (3)\n\nspectroscopic exhaust diagnostic measurements; and (4) MPD arc spoke\n\nphenomena. The scope of this program has been to investigate the\n\nfeasibility of building lightweight completely radiation-cooled long\xc2\xad\nlife thrusters and to simultaneously perform diagnostic studies of\n\nthe plasma processes with the aim of improving thruster performance.\n\nA low power thruster has been operated in a hands off life test of\n\n638 hours, except for 11 intentional starts and stops. An automatic\n\ncurrent control was used in this test, but with more recent cathode\n\nconfigurations no control appears necessary and no significant erosion\n\nhas occurred during 100 hr. tests. The propellant yielding the highest\n\nperformance is xenon but operation with many other propellants has been\n\npossible including a combination of H2 and CO2 . Recently a lightweight\n\nthruster was constructed. This thruster has very low power radiation\xc2\xad\ncooled magnetics and starter circuits. Presently parametric tests of\n\nthis thruster are in progress,\n\nThe present performance of the 30 kW NH3 radiation cooled thruster is\n\nshown in an attached fi.gure. This Lewis data shows both that the\n\nefficiency increases with arc power and that at constant power the\n\nspecific impulse can be varied over a wide range. This thruster was\n\ndeveloped and life tested for over 500 hrs. by McDonnell Douglas under\n\nIt represents the first truly radiation cooled\n\ncontract to Lewis.\nhigh power MPD arc thruster. The thruster is designed with adequate\n\ninsulation between the anode and the magnet so that a radiation cooled\n\npermanent magnetic could be utilized. The anode heat loss (40 to 60%\n\nof the total power) is the major inefficiency in this thruster, and\n\nthe requirement that this heat be radiated by the anode limits its\n\npower level to 40 kW. We are looking into the processes which affect\n\nthe arc voltage particularly the way current attaches to the cathode,\n\nin the hope that by learning to control this we can raise the arc volt\xc2\xad\nage to lower the anode losses while maintaining the current distribu\xc2\xad\ntion that is presently yielding as thrust over 70% of the net power put\n\ninto the plasma. Why the conversion of the net plasma power into thrust\n\ncan be so efficient has been shown by our spectroscopic measurements in\n\nthe exhaust. These show both that the exhaust can be primarily high\n\nvelocity neutrals and that the acceleration takes place in the magnetic\n\nnozzle outside the physical thruster.\n\nAt present it is not clear whether the current spoke generally present\n\nin these thrusters is detrimental to performance. It does, however,\n\ngreatly complicate theory and experiments to no clear advantage. There\xc2\xad\nfore, in additon to analytically and experimentally investigating spoke\n\nphenomena we are looking for ways to get rid of it. Preliminary tests\n\nwith the low-power thruster for example indicate that use of inductors\n\nin series with an azimuthally segmented anode will eliminate the current\n\nfluctuations on the segments.\n\n\nSPECIFIC IMPULSE VERSUS ARC EFFICIENCY\n\nMACDONNELL X-7\n30\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 /\n\n20\n_- 0. .\n\nARC,\nAFFiCIENCY\n\nwoo--\n\nARC POWER,\nKW\n\n/-35\n\n.... \'U-\n\n.\nAMMONIA\nFLOW RATE,\n\n25\n\nEFFI~ENCY\nLX\'gISEC\nG\nD\n0\n0\n\n10\n\no500 .__\n..\n1000\n"\n\n0.203\n\'.149\n.030\n.015\n\n__\n. .... .....\nio \n j\n..\n1500\n2000- 2500\n3000\n3500\nCS-49494\nSPECIFIC IMPULSE, SEC,\n\n32\n\n500 HOUR TEST OF A RADIATION COOLED MPD ARC THRUSTER\n\n\nD. W. ESKER AND J. C. KROUTIL\n\nMCDONNELL RESEARCH LABORATORIES\n\nST. LOUIS, MISSOURI 63166\nThe successful development of a MPD arc thruster to flight hardware\n\nstatus requires a demonstration of long term reliability.\nhe work des\xc2\xad\ncribed represents an initial step towards this goal. Specifically, a 500 hour\n\nlife test of a radiation cooled MED arc thruster is described. The thruster,\n\n(Fig. 1), developed under contract to NASA, consisted of a radiation cooled\n\nanode-cathode-insulator assembly connected to a water cooled electromagnet.\n\nThe design and performance characteristics of this thruster have been reported\n\npreviously. 1 The test \'was conducted in a three foot diameter vacuum chamber\n\nat a background pressure of approximately 9.0 x lo"3 Torr with a propellant\n\nmass flow rate of ammonia of 30 mg/sec. Test instrumentation included arc\n\nvoltage and current, magnet voltage and current, propellant flow rate, anode\n\nsurface temperature, magnet heat transfer, and photographic observation of the\n\ninterelectrode region.\n\nThe test was initiated with a propellant flow rate of 30 mg/sec., arc\n\ncurrent of 560 amperes, and axial magnetic field at the cathode tip of 0.14\n\ntesla. These conditions produced a specific impulse of 1770 seconds with an\n\nefficiency of17.1 percent. The thruster operated in a high voltage mode con\xc2\xad\ndition for the majority of the run with only several hours of low mode opera\xc2\xad\ntion at the start and end of the test. The arc voltage gradually increased\n\nfrom a value of near 55 volts early in the test to 64 volts after 425 hours.\n\nPhotographs of the cathode electrode indicated that the voltage increase\n\ncorrelated closely with the formation of a nodule or tit at the tip of the\n\nconical cathode. This nodule left the cathode at ts 428 hours with a subse\xc2\xad\nquent decrease in voltage, after which a new module began to form.\n\nThe test was voluntarily shut down after 508.5 hours for inspection of the\n\nthruster. An additional 45.5 hours was logged before the thruster was disassem\xc2\xad\nbled. The increasing voltage characteristic served to increase the thrust so\n\nthat the performance of the thruster varied over the course of the test, with a\n\nspecific impulse of 1900 seconds being recorded prior to the shut down for in\xc2\xad\nspection. Erosion of the boron nitride insulator was the greatest at 41% of\n\nits original weight. The cathode suffered a 2.9% weight loss and the anode\n\ngained a slight amount of weight over its initial value.\n\nThe results of this test suggest that the cathode electrode is the most\n\nsignificant component affecting long term operation rather than the anode.\n\nThe control of voltage mode and the erosion of the cathode and insulator are\n\nitems for future study.\n\n\niEsker, D.

Jarrett, F. Allario, B. D. Sidney and R. V. Hess\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\nOnset of a rotating disturbance has been examined in two MPD accelera\xc2\xad\ntors, the linear Hall accelerator (LEA) and the MPD arc, as shown in figures\n\n1 and 2. \n\nThis paper summarizes the results previously obtained1 ,2 and\n\npresents results of recent experiments.\n\nThe geometry of the MPD arc and the LHA is discussed in detail in\n\nreferences 1 and 2. The LHA has an approximately radial magnetic field\n\nand an axial electric field while the MPD arc has a coaxial electrode\n\narrangement with a diverging axial magnetic field. \nThe onset of the\n\nrotating disturbance in the two devices shows certain similarities despite\n\nthe difference in power range; the LEA operating typically at a power of\n\n0.1 kw and the NED arc as high as 30 kw. In figures 3 and 4, the critical\n\nmagnetic field, Bc, at onset of the instability is shown for the MPD arc\n\nas a function of mass flow and for the LEA as a function of pressure. Since\n\npressure in the electrode region increases with mass flow in either device,\n\nBc increases with mass flow in each case. In addition, for a given mass\n\nflow, Bc increases with molecular weight.\n\nThrough variation of the radial magnetic field distribution near the\n\ncathode of the LHA (due to the magnetic field of the cathode heating current)\n\nit was determined that the total magnetic field near the cathode determined\n\nthe onset of the instability in the entire electrode region. Because of the\n\nsimilarity in behavior of the rotating disturbance in the two accelerators,\n\nit was of interest to examine the MPD arc to see if the onset of the disturb\xc2\xad\nance also occurred in the region near the cathode.\n\nIn order to lower the power range of the MPD arc closer to the LEA,\n\na hollow instead of a solid cathode was used. Stable operation of the MPD\n\narc with a hollow cathode could be maintained from below 1 kw to 25 kw.\n\nFurthermore, a second solenoid with an independent power supply was in\xc2\xad\nstalled downstream from the anode to permit changes of the magnetic field\n\nconfiguration in the electrode region. \n The tip of the cathode was\n\nrepositioned 1/4 inch behind the anode so that superposition of the mag\xc2\xad\nnetic fields of the two coils permitted a wide variation of magnetic field\n\nin the electrode region. By comparing results from five different magnetic\n\nfield configurations obtained at onset, it was determined that the axial\n\nmagnetic field in a region close to the center plane of the anode determined\n\nthe onset of the rotating instability. This result appears to be different\n\nfrom that obtained in the LEA where the magnetic field near the cathode\n\ndetermines the onset. The following considerations suggest, however, a\n\ncommon basis for the phenomena.\n\n\n35\n\nPrevious studies of the MPD arc indicate a downstream bulging of\n\nthe current, with formation of a cathode jet which is closer to cathode\n\nthan anode potential. 3 It is reasonable to expect then that electrons\n\nemitted from the cathode follow the axial magnetic field lines for some\n\ndistance downstream of the cathode, eventually crossing the magnetic field\n\nlines where the combination of crossed electric and magnetic field\n\nenergetically allow it. The observed onset of the instability for the\n\nMPD arc near the center plane of the anode could coincide with the region\n\nwhere the mobile electrons begin to cross the magnetic field. This\n\ncriterion appears to be satisfied also for the LHA where the magnetic field\n\nis perpendicular to the electric field everywhere including the immediate\n\nvicinity of the cathode in contrast to the MPD arc geometries, therefore,\n\nin the LHA emitted electrons are forced to cross the magnetic field within\n\na short distance from the cathode. More sensitive magnetic field shaping\n\nand diagnostics are planned to gain a better understanding of the onset\n\nof rotating instabilities in an MPD arc.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n1.\n\nAllario, F.; Jarrett, 0., and Hess, R.

Seikel, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nBy examining a power balance for these DC discharges an understanding\n\nof the plasma processes that limit their performance can be obtained.\n\nIf only unavoidable discharge losses are considered then the limiting\n\nperformance is determined. The two major unavoidable losses in a DC\n\ndischarge are the power carried to the anode by the current and the\n\npower consumed in the ionization and competing excitation processes\n\nin the plasma volume.\n\nIf only the minimum anode power and ionization power losses are con\xc2\xad\nsidered then the limiting performance of a DC bombardrment ion thruster\n\ncan be evaluated. The limiting efficiency vs. specific impulse is a\n\nfunction of only the plasma discharge energy expended per AMU of beam\n\nion produced (i.e. eV/Ion-AMU). If the discharge has a constant elec\xc2\xad\ntron kinetic temperature, then for a given propellant, discharge volt\xc2\xad\nage, and anode work function, the discharge energy per beam ion AMU is\n\nonly a function of electron temperature. For any discharge voltage\n\nthere is an optimum discharge electron temperature. The calculated\n\nminimum values of eV/ion indicate that present 36 V Hg ion sources may\n\nbe approaching a fundamental limit. This analysis also indicates per\xc2\xad\nformance gains possible through raising the discharge voltage and the\n\npotential performance of thrusters using propellants other than Hg.\n\nIn a similar manner a power balance for the low power MPD arc thruster\n\nresults in predicting the limiting efficiency vs. specific impulse.\n\nThis analysis makes use of the results of a plasma expansion analysis\n\n(to be presented by Walker) and considers the minimum anode and volume\n\nionization losses. The theoretical performance limit so calculated is\n\ncompared with present NASA-Lewis low power xenon MPD arc thruster data.\n\nThe discrepancy between the theoretical limit and present performance\n\nindicates that substantial performance improvement may be possible.\n\nIn making these theoretical limit calculations both the magnetic field\n\nand sonic point location were optimized. If the sonic point were\n\nactually further downstream then the theoretical limit would be lower.\n\nThis point brings up one of the big questions yet to be answered for\n\nsuch flows. Where does the sonic point occur and why?\n\n\n41\n\nEXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF CURRENT ROTATIONS IN A MPD ARC\n\nROBERT A. COCHRAN, Research Assistant, and JAMES A. FAY, Professor,\n\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of\n\nTechnology, Cambridge, Mass.\n\nRecent experimental studdts indicate that under certain conditions\n\nthe current in the inner electrode rdiion of a MPD arc is not uniformly\n\n\ndistributed throughout the inner electrode region but is confined to an\n\nazimuthally localized region or spoke which rotates in the Amperian\n\ndirection at steady frequencies on the order of 100 Khz..This study\n\nexperimentally determines the conditions under which this highly non\xc2\xad\nuniform current distribution occurs and investigates the variation in\n\nthe frequency of the conducting region as well as the electrode voltage\n\n\nof the MPD arc operating in both the diffuse and spoke mode. The\n\nexperiment was conducted in a pulsed quasi-steady MPD arc of 500 ,sec\n\nduration. The electrode geometry consisted of two concentric copper rings\n\nof 1cm axial length having a 1cm radial gap. The inner ring had an\n\nouter radius of 2cm. The primary propellant used was argon and the arc\n\nbehavior was investigated for large variations in m(.056-4.0 gm/sec),\n\n1(100-5000 Amp), and B (0.1-2.0 telsa). Additional measurements were also\n\nmade using xenon, helium, and hydrogen as propellants.\n\nIt was found that the single rotating current spoke occurs at inter\xc2\xad\nThe\n\nmediate current levels above a certain magnetic field~strength.\ndiffuse at low current levels and at high\n\ndischarge is very uniform and\ncurrents it consists of many small fluctuations each corresponding\n\nto a small percent of the total current delivered to the arc. A comparison\n\nof the spoke frequency measurements with the actuator disk theory of Fay\n\nand Cochran (1) shows that the actuator disk model gives a satisfactory\n\nprediction of the behavior of the spoke frequency until a limiting frequency\nis reached after which the spoke approaches a constant rotational speed\n\nwhich is the same for all gases. The point at which the actuator disk\n\nmodel becomes invalid corresponds to a magnetic Reynolds number based on\n\nthe spoke speed of order one for all-gases investigated. The variation in\n\nthe electrode voltage was found to obey the correlation of Patrick and\n\nSchneiderman (2) when the arc was operated in the diffuse mode at low\n\ncurrent levels. In the spoke mode voltages several times this prediction\n\nwere measured and can be explained in terms of the EMF generated by the\n\nrotating spoke.\n\n1.

Jedlicka\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California\n\nThe present steady-state accelerator, which was installed two\n\nyears ago, receives plasma from a constricted arc. This combination\n\noffers high plasma entering velocity and electrical conductivity\n\nwithout the need for seed. \n The flow through the accelerator\n\napproximates fully developed pipe flow, a consequence of its high\n\ntemperature, and results in severe circulating currents upon appli\xc2\xad\ncation of a transverse magnetic field. \n For many combinations of\nJ\n\nand B, no net acceleration of the stream occurs.\n\nThe most favorable combination of operating conditions has\n\nproduced a velocity increase of 2 \ntimes that for which J=B=O,\nor\n\n4 times that before J was applied but with non-zero B. The absolute\n\nvelocity for these conditions, however, was only 8 km/s; which\nis\n\nnot spectacular when compared to the 6.3 km/s available from the\n\nconstricted arc alone under other conditions.\n\nPossible means to improve performance are discussed.\n\n\nTHE DESIGN OF THE LANGLEY TWENTY MEGAWATT LINEAR\nPLASMA ACCELERATOR FACILITY\nArlea.L Carter\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nA linear, crossed-field plasma accelerator facility for high-speed\n\naerodynamic testing and basic research inhigh-speed magnetohydrodynamics\n\nhas been designed. Use was made of the experience and results obtained\n\nwith previous smaller, lower speed accelerators together with a quasi\xc2\xad\none-dimensional\\theoretical analysis. General design philosophy centered\n\naround three criteria:\n(1) make J x B as large as practicable; (2) operate\n\nwith approximately constant current density; (3) maintain a constant Hall\n\npotential gradient\\ Convergent and divergent channel geometries were\n\nconsidered and reje ted because of, among other things, lack of uniform gas\n\nproperties across the channel cross section and the difficulty of properly\n\nmatching the device to an existing power supply. The final design has a\n\nconstant-area channel designed for constant electrode potential difference\n\nwith the magnetic field tailored to achieve this condition. A compromise\n\nin the magnetic field strength at the upstream end of the accelerator to\n\nhelp assure proper operation of the are heater resulted in a small decrease\nin the electrode potential difference and an increase in electrode current\nfor the first four or five electrodes. Figures 1 and 2 are computer \xc2\xad\npredictions of velocity and current density based on the modified magnetic\nfield distribution shown in figure 3.\n\nThe matching of the accelerator to the existing 10 megawatt power supply\n\nis difficult. The power supply has eight separate modules which may be\n\nconnected in any series-parallel combination. The number of accelerator\n\nelectrodes greatly exceeds the number of modules available for power. With\xc2\xad\nout individual power supplies for each set of electrodes an extensive resist\xc2\xad\nanee network is needed to properly divide the current among the many electrodes\n\nsince the applied potential distribution along the anode and cathode walls\n\nmust match the internally generated Hall potential distribution or circulating\n\nHall currents will result, degrading the accelerator performance. A special\n\nresistor network was designed to handle the high power dissipation.\n\nFigure 4 is a schematic diagram of the facility. The arc heater is shown\n\nat the left and consists of a cathode, constrictor, anode, plenum, and super\xc2\xad\nsonic nozzle. Nozzle exit conditions are a velocity of approximately 3800 m/s,\n\nenthalpy of 1.6 x 107 Jfkg, mass flow of 18 g/s. The working gas is nitrogen\n\nseeded with 2 percent mole fraction of cesium vapor. One 10 megawatt power\n\nsupply is used to power the arc heater and a second 10 megawatt supply is\n\nused for the accelerator which mounts between the poles of a large c-magnet.\n\nThe accelerator channel is 6.3 cm square and 50 cm long; it contains 36 pairs\n\nof individually water-cooled electrodes. The sidewalls are boron nitride\n\nplates backed by water-cooled copper, coated with beryllium oxide for elec\xc2\xad\ntrical insulation. Each water and electrical connection is of a "quick\xc2\xad\ndisconnect" type, greatly facilitating the attachment of the 156-water leads\n\n\n44\n\n\nand 72 electrical leads. The accelerator forms its own environmental\n\nchamber eliminating the need for mounting it within a vacuum tank.\n\nImmediately downstream of the accelerator is a test section used for flow\n\nobservation and diagnostics. The flow is exhausted into a five-foot\n\ndiameter duct which is cooled by spraying water on its outer surface.\n\nA four-stage steam ejector provides a vacuum source.

J. Sovie and L. D. Nichols\n\nNASA Lewis Research Center\n\nThe NASA-Lewis closed loop MHD facility (Fig. 1) has been operated sev\xc2\xad\neral times at 3200\' F in the past year with no facility problems. Con\xc2\xad\nsequently, we have been able to concentrate on the plasma and generator\n\nproblems. In order to increase the plasma conductivity it was necessary\n\nto install an impurity purge system and a new cesium injection system.\n\nThe method of pre-ionization was also changed. The significance of\n\nthese design changes will be discussed briefly. As far as the generator\n\ndata is concerned open circuit voltages and short circuit currents have\n\nbeen measured. The effects of internal current leakages on the measured\n\ngenerator performance have been ascertained and will be discussed. It\n\nwas also found that a coating is formed on the generator electrodes that\n\nseriously inhibits the current flow in the external load circuit. Vari\xc2\xad\nous starting techniques are presently being investigated in order to\n\neliminate this coating and these results will also be presented.\n\n\nrHEATER "STAIINLE5S\nI STEEL S HELL\n\n2 TESLA\nMAGNET-I\n\nNOZZLE\n\nASTABLE\nRE.FRPAC.TOR.Y. :\n_j!\n\n",\n\nTO-CESIUM\nMHD DUCT\nCONDENSER\n\n0\n\nFOU GRAPH ITE\nRESISTANCE\nHEA TER S\n\n\'7ATER%\n\n~COOLINIG\n\nfR0 M\nTO HEATER\nINLET\n\nFigure I\n\n-\n\nLINE S\n\nCOMPRESSOR.\nl\'\n\nBedplate showing heater, nozzle MHD duct, magnet, and reheater.\n\nThe flow distributor at the heater inlet Is not shown.\n\n\n55\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF ELECTROTHERMAL INSTABILITIES ON SEVERAL\n\nNON-EQUILIBRIUM PLASMAS\n\nby Allan R. Bishop, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nThe effects of electrothermal instabilities on several different non-equi\xc2\xad\nlibrium plasmas is examined. In argon seeded with cesium the effect of\n\na molecular impurity magnifies the instability losses. A one-tenth per\xc2\xad\ncent carbon monoxide impurity combined with the instability reduces the\n\nmaximum power density to one-eighth of its ideal value. This maximum\n\nvalue occurs at a load parameter of about 0.2.\n\nThe effect of the instability on the output power of a specific generator,\n\nusing neon seeded with cesium, is also examined. With generator shape,\n\nMach number, pressure drop) and magnetic field specified, the output\n\npower loss as a function of stagnation temperature is determined. The\n\nloss varies from a factor of four at 1800 K down to zero at about 25000\n\nK, where the instability disappears.\n\nThe feasibility of using helium seeded with uranium as a working fluid\n\nin generators driven by liquid or gas core nuclear reactors ,is\ndiscussed.\n\nThe use of a helium-uranium mixture appears to be a possibility although\n\nthe power density is lower than with more conventional working fluids.\n\nThe optimum mixture ratio is about six parts uranium per thousand parts\n\nhelium. Even with the electrothermal instability losses included, the\n\nnon-equilibrium conductivity is higher than the equilibrium conductivity.\n\n\n56\n\n"HOT" ELECTRODE SHEATH DROPS IN A MHD GENERATOR\n\nby M. A. Mantenieks, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nElectrode sheath drops in an arc heated argon, supersonic MHD generator\n\nwere measured. The Mach 3.5 generator has carbonized 2% Th-W electrodes\n\nand is capable of generating currents of up to 34 amps and open circuit\n\nvoltages of about 20 volts with a magnetic field of .55 Tesla depending\n\non the electrode gap. The other parameters measured in the experiment\n\nincluded gas pressure, gas temperature (measured calorimetrically) and\n\nelectrode temperature as a function of generated current through the\n\nelectrode. Because of the highly non-equiltbrium state of the plasma\n\n(due to the arc heater and frozen flow) zero current sheaths at the\n\nanode and cathode are of the order of one volt. The cathode sheath\n\ndrop increases from this value, as the current increases, to 6.5-10.3\n\nvolts depending on the initial cathode temperature and plasma condi\xc2\xad\ntions. Once this level is reached the sheath drop becomes relatively\n\nindependent of the current. The anode voltage decreases with increas\xc2\xad\ning current and becomes negative at higher currents (-4.6 volts at 30\n\namps).\n\nThe cathode temperature was found to first decrease with current and\n\nthen increase linearly at higher currents. (For example: Temp. drops\n\nfrom 2250\' K at I = 0 amps to 2232\' K at I =\n 3.5 amps and increases to\n\n23100 K at I = 22 amps). The anode temperature increases linearly with\n\nincreasing current. A current balance at the electrodes following the\n\nwork of Lyubimov 1 and an energy balance at the electrode surface give\n\nqualitative agreement with the experimental results except for the high\n\ncurrent regime.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nI\n\nG.

Nichols and Maris A. Mantenleks,\n\nNASA Lewis Research Center\n\n\n-\n\nThe mode of electron emission from an MHD generator cathode can affect\n\nthe performance of the generator. Under certain conditions the emis\xc2\xad\nsion of the electrons is confined to a small spot on the cathode. These\n\nspots are similar to the spots observed in\'any thermionic arc (1).\n\nThere are many theoretical studies of these arc spots - and they have\n\nin common the assumption that the spot is formed by ion energy transfer\n\nto \t\nthe cathode. The ions are formed in a region near the cathode as a\n\nresult of electron collisions with gas atoms. The differences among\n\nthe previous studies involve their treatment of the ionization region\n\nand the number of unknown parameters which must be specified in order\n\nto use the model to predict current voltage characteristics. Ecker (i)\n\ndetermines the ion current from the solution which gives the minimum\n\nvoltage as a function of a "contraction parameter" rather than consider\xc2\xad\ning the energy conducted from the spot. Bauer (3) and Lee and Greenwood\n\n(4) leave the ion current as a free parameter to be determined experi\xc2\xad\nmentally. Adams and Robinson (5) consider a rather complete set of heat\n\ntransfer mechanisms, but require the specification of the angle between\n\nthe current stream tube and the normal \nto \t\nthe cathode before comparison\n\nbetween their model and experiment can be made. The aim of this study\n\nis to present a model which requires no empirical constants. Such a\n\ntheory is presented by Bade and Yos (6). But they make many assumptions\n\nabout the nature of the phenomena to develop a simple theory. The\n\npresent report is an attempt to improve the Bade and Yos theory by using\n\nfewer assumptions but retaining simplicity. Bade and Yos assume that\n\nthe ions and electrons are at the same temperature, all the atoms are\n\nionized, and that the electron current carries no energy from the ion\xc2\xad\nization region into the discharge. We offer a means of calculating\n\nelectron temperature, ion density, and the energy carried by the elec\xc2\xad\ntrbns from the ionization region to the discharge volume. In all other\n\nrespects these two models are the same. The results for given gas con\xc2\xad\nditions and electrode work function predict a sheath,voltage which\n\ndecreases with both increasing current for a fixed undisturbed (i.e.,\n\nfar from the spot) cathode temperature, and increasing undisturbed\n\ncathode temperature at a fixed current. Experimental data is shown\n\nwhich supports the conclusions predicted by the model.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nI J. M. Somerville, The Electric Arc, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1959,\n\n\npp. 64-68.\n\n2\n\nG.

Kendall, Supervisor Fluid Dynamics\n\nUnited Aircraft Research Laboratories\n\nEast Hartford, Connecticut\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe nuclear light bulb rocket engine concept is based on the transfer\n\nof energy by thermal radiation from gaseous nuclear fuel through an inter\xc2\xad\nnally cooled transparent wall to seeded hydrogen propellant (Fig. 1). In a\n\nreference engine design, the effective radiating temperature of the nuclear\n\nfuel is 15,000 R and the hydrogen propellant exit temperature is 12,000 R.\n\nFor this design, the calculated specific impulse is 1870 sec, the engine\n\nthrust is 92,000 lb, and the engine weight is 70,000 lb. The gaseous nuclear\n\nfuel is kept away from the transparent wall by a vortex created by the tan\xc2\xad\ngential injection of neon near the inside surface of the transparent wall.\n\nThe neon discharging from the cavity contains gaseous nuclear fuel which is\n\nthen condensed, centrifugally separated from the neon, and pumped back into\n\nthe fuel-containment region of the vortex. The neon is also pumped back\n\ninto the cavity. The closed-cycle fuel system leads to the possibility of\n\nproviding perfect containment of the gaseous nuclear fuel and fission\n\nproducts.\n\nExperiments were conducted to simulate the thermal environment in a unit\n\ncavity of a nuclear light bulb engine. These experiments include develop\xc2\xad\nment of a high-intensity r-f induction-heated light source, transparent-wall\n\nmodel tests, and propellant heating tests.\n\nThe objective of the high-intensity r-f light source research is to\ndevelop a non-nuclear source having a radiant energy flux in the range of\ninterest for the full-scale engine (equivalent black-body radiating tempera\xc2\xad\ntures between 8000 and 15,000 R). This research was conducted using the\nUARL 1.2-megw r-f induction heater to deposit energy in argon plasmas (Fig, 2).\nThe configuration used in these experiments consists of two concentric fused\nsilica tubes located within the coils of the induction heater; argon is\n\ninjected at one end to produce a vortex flow and is exhausted through ports\n\nlocated at the centers of the water-cooled copper end walls. Tests were con\xc2\xad\nducted at pressures between 2 and 16 atm.\n\nFor the maximum-power test condition achieved to date, a total of 216 kw\n\nwas deposited in the discharge (Fig. 3); of this, approximately 156 kw\n\n\n*\n\nThis research was supported by the joint AEC-NASA Space Nuclear Propulsion\nOffice as part of Contracts NASw-847 and SNPC-70 and is reported in Refs. 1-3.\n\n\n92\n\n6o\n\n(75 percent) was radiated outward through the peripheral wall of the test\n\nchamber. The corresponding radiant energy flux was 36.8 kw/in. 2 , which is\nequivalent to a black-body radiating temperature of 10,200 R. This is well\n\ninto the range of interest for the engine; hence, the development has progres\xc2\xad\n\t\nsed to the point where useful experiments related to the thermal environment\n\n\nof the engine are being conducted.\n\nThe objective of the transparent-wall model tests is to test models\n\n(Fig. 4) adjacent to the high-intensity light source to determine their\n\noperating limits. The heat deposition rate expected in the full-scale engine\n\ndue to thermal radiation from the nuclear fuel at an equivalent black-body\nradiating temperature of 15,000 R is approximately 1.65 kw/in. 2 of wall sur\xc2\xad\n\nface area. Tests employing a O-.005-in. wall thickness model resulted in heat\n2\ndeposition rates on the inside surface of the model as high as 2.2 kw/in.\n(i.e., greater than that expected for the full-scale engine) with no apparent\ndamage to the fused silica coolant tubes.\n\nThe objectives of the propellant heating experiments are (1) to develop\n\nmethods for injecting solid particle seeds into a simulated propellant stream,\n\n(2) to study the effectiveness of buffer layers for preventing wall coating,\n\nand (3) to conduct experiments in which a large percentage of the incident\n\nradiation from the light source is absorbed in a simulated propellant stream.\n\nThis \t ork is still in the initial stages. The propellant heating configura\xc2\xad\nw\ntions used are generally similar to the geometries of the components expected\n\nto be employed in the nuclear light bulb engine. Argon seeded with micron\xc2\xad\nsized carbon particles (instead of hydrogen seeded with tungsten particles)\nwas used as the simulated propellant. At the low radiant energy source power\nlevels of up to 3 kw that were used in these initial tests, temperature rises\nup to 223 R were obtained. Further increases in simulated propellant tempera\xc2\xad\nture rise will be obtained primarily 1y means of increased power, improved\nparticle deagglomeration to increase absorption, and more effective buffer\nlayers to reduce the coating of particles on the transparent walls.\nREFERENCES\n\n(To be published as NASA Contractor Reports)\n\n1. \t Roman, W.

T. Schneider, C. D. Kylstra and M. J. Ohanian\n\nUniversity of Florida\n\nGainesville, Florida\n\nThe eventual successful operation of a nuclear energy source utilizing fuel\n\nin the plasma state, whether for propulsion or other applications, will require\n\nknoled\n...\n..\nknowledge o the r . .. ... .. by the ua nt un. plasma as a function of\nof te\noperating pressures, temperatures, wavelengths, and system geometry. Supple\xc2\xad\nmentary to this is the composition of the plasma, i.e., the partial pressure\n\ndistributions of the various uranium ionic species and the electrons, as well\n\nas that of any working fluid present. Calculations concerning criticality,\n\nradiative heat transfer to the working fluid, and system startup and control\n\nall need the above information.\n\nThe object of the uranium plasma research program at the University of\nFlorida is to acquire at least some of the radiation emission and composition\ndata needed in addition to some nuclear data (Ref. 1-5). This\'paper will be\nconcerned with the preliminary experimental results of the measurement of\ntemperature and partial pressure of a uranium plasma. (For other research\nefforts on radiation and composition of uranium plasmas see Ref. 6 and 7.)\nThe experimental apparatus is a high pressure chamber capable of 100\natmosphere pressure with water cooling to the thermal shield, tungsten cathode,\nand tungsten crucible with a uranium insert as the anode, the uranium is\nvaporized by a D.C. arc.\nThe measurement method used for the arc temperatures and temperature\ndistributions is the Boltzmann Plot technique and the single-line relative\n\nintensity method which can be used when the radial intensity distribution\n\nshows an off-axis maximum.\n\nThe partial pressure distributions of the individual uranium ionic species\n\ncan be obtained from a correlation of the temperature distribution from the\n\nBoltzmann Plot techniques and the temperature distributions from the single\xc2\xad\nline relative intensity method. Fig. 1 shows the result of a temperature deter\xc2\xad\nmination using Boltzmann Plots for singly ionized uranium. -Fig. 2 shows the\n\npartial pressure distribution for singly ionized uranium (UII).\n\nThe thermodynamic characteristics of uranium at high temperatures\n\n(T > 30000 K) are important for several applications, e.g., accident analysis.\n\nDue to temperature limitations little experimental data is available. One\n\nimportant property falling into this category is the vapor pressure. Recent\n\nwork using the effusion meffiod (Ref. 8 and 9), has been limited to a maximum\n\ntemperature of approximately 2500 0 K. For higher tepperatures, the vapor\n\npressure must be extrapolated. The boiling point temperature predicted by\n\nextrapolation is in excess of 4000 0 K at one atmosphere. For these conditions,\n\nuranium is already a plasma.\n\nNottingham (Ref. 10) has shown that for an arc, the voltage-current\ncharacteristic can be related to the anode boiling temperature. Thus, the\n\nboiling temperature can be determined by measuring the voltage-current charac\xc2\xad\nteristics.\n\n\n66\n\nFigure 8 illustrates a typical set of arc voltage-current characteristics.\nFigure 4 shows the uranium boiling temperatures deternined in this experiment.\n\nThere is good agreement between the experimentally determined boiling temperatures\n\nand the boiling points predicted by extrapolation from low temperature vapor\n0\npressure measurements. The detennined boiling temperature is 3,837 K for 1.0\n\natmosphere.\n\nFuture plans for the research effort are the detennination of the emission\n\ncoefficient of a uranium plasma for a wide range of temperatures and pressures,\nthe study of a fissioning plasma and the study of the interaction of fission\n\nproducts with a noble gas plasma.\n\n\n67\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

F. Massier+ and T. K. Bose#\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nPasadena, California\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the heat transfer to an anode\n\nin the presence of a transverse gas flow. The work was initiated because the\n\nheat transfer to some of the elements of plasma propulsion devices, especially\n\nto the anode, can be significantly higher than that encountered in chemical\n\npropulsion thrust chambers. Furthermore, impingement of electrons on the\n\nanode can produce an amount of heating greatly exceeding that caused by con\xc2\xad\nvection from the bulk motion of the plasma. Experimental heat transfer results\n\nare analyzed in conjunction with a theoretical prediction method for ionized\n\ngas flows over a segmented flat surface with an electric field applied to the\n\nupstream segment, which is the anode (Fig. 1). Under the influence of the\n\ntransverse gas flow, the arc attaches near the downstream end of the anode,\nand the discharge is deflected from a vertical plasma column into an elongated\nU-shape by the motion of the argon gas giving a boundary layer type appearance\nover the anode and the segments downstream of the anode. Tests have been con\xc2\xad\nducted in an argon atmosphere at a nominal pressure of 50 mm Hg and a current\n\nof approximately 40 amps over a gas velocity range of about 55 to 260 ft/sec.\nEach of the electrode segments are individually cooled and the heat transfer\nrate is determined from the coolant flow rate and the rise in the coolant\ntemperature. In the absence of plasma free-stream temperature measurements,\n\nwhich are planned, the temperature is deduced from heat loads to the three\n\nsegments downstream of the anode. By matching the heat load distribution of\n\nthe downstream segments with the theoretical predictions by considering con\xc2\xad\nvection and diffusion only, it has been established that the origin of the\n\nthermal boundary layer for all tests occurred at a distance of about 0.8 of\n\nthe segment length (0.20 in.) from the leading edge of the anode. \nIt is also\n\ndeduced, with the help of Fig. 2, that the free stream temperature associated\n\nwith the heat transfer for one that was around 13,000\xc2\xb0R, and was almost con\xc2\xad\nstant along the flow direction. From the experimental heat load to the anode,\n\nthe theoretical heat load to the anode due to convection and diffusion is\n\nsubtracted to obtain the contribution of the electric current, which was 0.247\n\nBtu/sec or 87 percent of the total heat load. This was then used in conjunction\n\nwith the theoretical prediction as shown in Fig. 2 to estimate the combined\n\nanode fall potential and work function which was found to be 4.9 volts. \nThis\n\nvalue seems quite reasonable compared with measurements of other investigations.\n\nThis work represents the results of one phase of research carried out in the\n\nPropulsion Research and Advanced Concepts Section of the Jet Propulsion\n\nLaboratory, California Institute of Technology, under Contract NAS7-100,\n\nsponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n+Group Supervisor \n\n\n#NASA-NRC Resident Research Associate\n\n\nINESIATO\n\nOFii\nTO\n\nHEA\n\nTRANSFERili*\n\nELECTRODE\n\ni\xc2\xa2PLASMAiFiOW\n\nANODEGURETS\n\nd---\n\nANODE HEAT TRANSFER\n\n\n0.4\n0i\n\nFOR (Os +\n\nw)= 5 VOLTS\n\nHEAT\nLOAD,\n\n0.2\n\nBTU/sec\n\n0\n\n5,000\n\n10,000\n\nFREE STREAM TEMPERATURE, OR\n\nPROPULSION DIVISION\n\nRESEARCH AND ADVANCED CONCEPTS SECTION\n\n\nPIGt]Bf P\n\n15,000\n\n75\nA STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF ION\nINTERACTIONS IN PLASMA ACCELERATORS\nSol Aisenberg and K. W. Chang\n\nSpace Sciences, Incorporated\n\nWaltham, Massachusetts\n\nAs part of the study of plasma boundary interactions in magnetically\naccelerated plasmas, it was established that as much as 15 percent of the\nplasma driving force was transferred by the positive ions to the cathode.\nThis ion currentdrag at the cathode contributes to the cathode damage as\nwell as to the reduced plasma propulsion efficiency. The study of the trans\xc2\xad\nlational cathode drag due to the positive ions (and to the neutral gas compo\xc2\xad\nnent as well) indicated that there is a threshold in the tangential drag force\nas well as a saturation effect. The threshold can be ascribed either to a\nthreshold in the tangential ion velocity, in the ion current partitioning, or\nin the tangential accommodation coefficient. In studying the effect of ion\ncurrents on the cathode it was established that there is a need for an accu\xc2\xad\nrate measurement of the ion and plasma velocity. With this velocity meas\xc2\xad\nurement as a function of magnetic field and current it is possible to determine\nif there is, indeed, a threshold in the tangential velocity. At the same time,\nthe measurement of the velocity together with the drag measurement can per\xc2\xad\nmit one to deduce the ion current partitioning at the cathode. The determi\xc2\xad\nnation of the ion current partitioning at the cathode spot will also be of help\nin the establishment of a model for the electron emission at arc cathodes.\nThe recent effort, therefore, has been devoted to the determination of\nthe plasma velocity in order to determine the 1) ion current fraction at the\ncathode spot, Z) any possible threshold in ion tangential velocity, and 3) the\nexistehce of a saturation effect in ion velocity.\nThere are a number of different ways of measuring ion velocity: one\nis the back EMF niethod where the terminal voltage is measured as a function\nof transverse magnetic field for a constant arc current and gap spacing. A\nsecond method of determination of plasma velocity is by means of a time-of\xc2\xad\nflight measurement where the velocity of a moving plasma is measured by\nmeans of photo-multipliers, and is an unsatisfactory method of determining\nplasma velocity since it actually measures the velocity of propagation of the\nplasma phase rather than the velocity of the individual plasma components.\nThis is shown by the existence of the phenomenon of retrograde motion.\nMeasurements were made in a circular accelerator channel to compare\nthe velocity deduced from back EMF with the velocity deduced by time-of\xc2\xad\nflight measurements for the identical I x B accelerator situation. The analysis\nof Alfven suggests the existence of an ionization limiting velocity. Measure\xc2\xad\nments have shown that\'the back EMF determination of plasma velocity is much\n\ncloser to the values expected from the ionization limiting velocity and that\nthe time-of-flight method gives about two orders of magnitude of lower ve\xc2\xad\nlocity and is, therefore, unsuited for velocity determination. The ionization\nlimiting velocity as determined by the theory, of Alfven is predicted to be a\nconstant independent of magnetic field. Some results are illustrated in\nFigure 1. The velocity deduced from the back EMF method is essentially a\nconstant since it is related to the slope of terminal voltage with respect to\nmagnetic field and it was observed that the slope is essentially a constant.\nThe time-of-flight method indicates a slight increase of transit velocity as\na function of magnetic field. The concept of ionization limiting velocity sug\xc2\xad\ngests that this velocity is independent of pressure While measurements of the\nvelocity determined from back EMF and also from time-of-flight show a de\xc2\xad\ncrease of velocity with increasing pressure.\nAs part of this research program a technique has been developed for\nthe direct measurement of plasma ions and atoms by means of a Doppler\nshift technique. The system is illustrated in Figure 2. Light from the plasma\nis sampled by means of fiber optics and can be used to measure velocities\nfor both approaching and receding plasmas. The wave length shifts of the\nradiation is measuted very accurately by the means of a Fabry-Perot inter\xc2\xad\nferometer. By modulation of the interferometer mirror and by means of a phase\nsensitive detector it is possible to close the feedback loop in order to op\xc2\xad\nerate the system as an optical discriminator where a resonant frequency of the\ninterferometer is locked to the line center. In this way the Doppler shift sig\xc2\xad\nnal consists of a DC output voltage which is directly proportional to the ion\nor atom velocity. Preliminary measurements of the Doppler shift velocity\nindicate that it is comparable with the values determined from the back EMF\nmethod as well as with the values approximately expected from the ionization\nlimiting velocity. Doppler shift measurements are being made for different\ngases and electrodes and as a function of gas pressure, arc current and trans\xc2\xad\nverse magnetic field.\nThe role of positive ions in the cathode spot has also been studied.\nIt is well known that in the arc discharge, as the gas pressure is reduced, the\ncurrent density at the cathode decreases gradually until at a lower pressure, a\ntransition phase is reached, after which the current density suddenly increases\nto very high values. This transition is believed to be a change from a thermionic\ncathode to a field type of cathode. The usual model of field emission, which is\nbased on the electrostatic field of the average ion space charges in the bipolar\nsheath, is inadequate to explain the observed level of emission current den\xc2\xad\nsities. A new model based on a modified field emission process which takes\ninto account the local electric field associated with each individual ion is\npresented. Preliminary calculations show that this added effect due to the\nintense local ionic force field can indeed provide an emission current large\nenough to account for the observed current densities. Experimental verification\nof this model requires an experimental determination of the positive ion current\nfraction at the cathode.\n\n77\n\nDespite recent advances in the area of arc and plasma research,\nthere has been no satisfactory way of measuring the fraction of electron\ncurrent at the cathode surface. Although this information is vital for the\nunderstanding of the emission mechanisms, only very crude estimates are\navailable in the literature. These estimates are usually obtained from\nenergy balance calculations, and they are inaccurate because of the un\xc2\xad\ncertainty in various unknown parameters. The present results of the tan\xc2\xad\ngential drag measurements and the Doppler shift determination of velocity\nwill permit evaluation of the ion current fraction at the cathode spot. An\nadditional method for the determination of current partitioning at the cathode\nis proposed, based on the principle of perpendicular force and momentum\nbalance at the cathode surface. A unique model for various components of\nelectrode forces is presented which is capable of explaining the known\nbehavior of cathode forces at different pressure and current levels. The\nfraction of electron current at the cathode can be determined from the fol\xc2\xad\nlowing equation:\nF + nekTe A ee\nI\n\n(I/e) (I-l\n\na N/ZkTci7r m\nevap\nc\nc\nZmie\n\nA\n\ncd I\n\nWhere I is the measured total arc current, I , the electron current at the\n\ncathode, a- , the normal momentum accommodation coefficient, e,the\n\ncd, the cathode drop, F, the\n\nelectronic charge, mi, the ionic mass,\nmeasured resultant force on the cathode, N e , the electron number density\n\nof the arc spot, Te, the electron temperature of the arc spot,r\n, the\n\nflux of evaporating cathode material, T , the cathode temperature, m, the\n\nmolecular mass of the cathode material, A, the cathode spot area and k,\n\nthe Boltzmann constant.\n\nBecause in the low pressure range of interest the conditions of\n\nA and F>>nekT eA are usually satisfied (as a simple,\n\nF>>Fevap VZkc\nITmc\norder of magnitude calculation indicates), the present method is believed\nto be effective and accurate especially in the low pressure range where the\narc is supported by the ion microfield emission process.\n\n78\n\nCUMMUIATIVE LIST\n\nREPORTS,\n\nPUBLICATIONS, AND PRESENTATIONS\n\n\nUNDER THIS PROGRAM\n\n1.\n\nS.

In the earlier analysis we had assumed the flow to\n\nbe in quasi-equilibriun such that the electron density could be calcu\xc2\xad\nlated from the Saha Law using the electron temperature. The primary\n\nobjective of the present analysis is to extend the previous study to the\nsituation where ionization and recombination rates are slow enough to cause\nsignificant departures from quasi-equilibrium.\nIn other wordsowe wish to\nconsider finite rates and study flows which are to some extent frozen.\nIn the earlier work, the electron temperature was taken into account\nby considering the partial differential equation governing the conservation\nof electron energy. In order to provide the wall boundary condition the\nplasma sheath was considered in a simple manner. For the present investi\xc2\xad\ngation it is necessary to include one additional equation governing the\n\nelectron density, which is the partial differential equation for the con\xc2\xad\nservation of electron species. Including this additional equation means\n\nthat we are solving four highly nonlinear partial differential equations by\n\nthe finite difference method we have developed. This has the effect of\nsubstantially slowing down an already tedious numerical calculation, since\nnow 4 x 4 matrices have to be inverted at each calculation point rather\nthan 3 x 3 as before.\nTo date, the new system of equations allowing for finite rates have\n\nbeen formulated and their transformation completed. The transformed equa\xc2\xad\ntions have also been reduced to finite difference format in a much more\ncompact form than had been done before. The hope here is that this new\nform will permit a reduction in computer time. A computer program has\n\nbeen written to solve these equations in their finite difference form, and\n\ncalculations are in progress.\n\n\n1\n\nComputer and Applied Sciences, Inc.\n\n2\nCase Western Reserve University\n\n\n83\n\nSTRUCTURE OF A COLLISIONLESS SHEATH IN THE\n\nPRESENCE OF A MAGNETIC FIELD*\n\nH. A. Hassan\n\nNorth Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina\n\n27607\n\n\nThe objective of this Grant is to study the surface-sheath-plasma interactions\n\nin devices being considered for plasma acceleration and MHD power generation. In\n\nsuch devices the electron temperature is different from the heavy particle temperature\n\nand one needs to consider the structure of the sheath near the electrode to ob\xc2\xad\ntain necessary boundary conditions. The description of the plasma in a given\n\ndevice is then obtained by matching the sheath solution and the solution of the\n\nconservation equations of the various plasma constituents at the sheath edge.\n\nThe appropriate transport properties for a plasma in a magnetic field and\n\nthe influence of the surface parameters on the sheath structure were studied\n\nunder this Grant I - 4 . At present, we are in the process of integrating these\nstudies so that we may obtain an understanding of the coupling between surface,\nsheath and the bulk of the plasma. The work is in the computational stage.\n\nThe work carried out in References 2-4 assumes that the sheath thickness\nis less than the mean free paths and the Larmor radii. When the restriction\non the Larmor radii is relaxed, the equations governing the collisionless sheath\nare the Vlasov equation and the appropriate Maxwell\'s equations.

Unfortunately, plasmas of interest in fusion research are sel\xc2\xad\ndom, if ever, quiescent.\n\nA static current-voltage characteristic is.generally obtained by filter\xc2\xad\ning out any noise, and the resulting curve is then analyzed in the normal\n\nmanner to obtain electron temperature.\n\nIt is not generally realized that the variation in noise amplitude as\n\nprobe voltage is changed may possibly be used as a means of estimating\n\nthe electron temperature. In some cases it may even be possible to\n\ndetermine whether the electron temperature, number density, or plasma\n\npotential is the time varying quantity. This note will investigate the\n\neffect of a sinusoidal variation of the above quantities on peak-to\xc2\xad\npeak probe noise.\n\nConsider a plane probe and let the electron current to it be given by\n\n\njr JpA\n\nft\n\n(v\n(iV )\n\n(lb)\n\nwhere V is the probe voltage measured with respect to plasma potential,\n\nand the other quantities have their customary meanings.

The slope\nof the In t against probe voltage gives the correct value of the\nelectron temperature in both cases. A variation in plasma tempera\xc2\xad\nture manifests itself by having a non-linear portion for the elec\xc2\xad\ntron retarding region, and by taking on a fixed value within the\naccelerating region.\nAfter the particular time-varying parameter is determined, its ampli\xc2\xad\ntude may be found from a measurement of noise amplitude at plasma\n\npotential as shown in Fig. 2.\n\n\nFL\xc2\xa7\n\ngYP/IPCA L\nT2\n\nG sout T-S\n\nCN\n-NJj 72\n\n3\n\nNORIL~t\nOD\nc\n\n,\nAt~~\n\n/-\n\nPR ,-?L\'-\n\n,Cj7.\n\nIl\n\nP16 z\nEFF7CT\n\n0N,\n\noF- VAfRI/T/ 0\n\nPEAI <TO\n\nPCA K\n\nOR Vp\nAr\'lPLITU0&-\n\nOF" N) T,\n\nWISE\n\nN\n\n1.0\n\nNORMA L-\n\nAT\n\n\':o\n\n4v\n\n.4\n\n0\n\n2\nDN.1\nDIMEN51ONLb-SS .\n\n.f\n4\nA\nAMPLI TUDE-.\n\n90\n\nTHE EFFECT OF SPACE CHARGE ON THE OPERATION OF\n\nELECTRO-STATIC ENERGY ANALYZERS\n\nby Richard R. Woollett\n\nNASA-Lewis Research Center\n\n\nWhen electrostatic energy analyzers are operated in plasmas, space\n\ncharge inside the analyzer may lead to incorrect ion and electron\n\ntemperature measurements. These space charge effects may become im\xc2\xad\nportant when: (a) the plasma density is high; (b) the agnetic field\n\nis high; (c) or the spacing between the analyzer grids is large. The\n\npotential of the analyzer aperture plate, which is in contact with the\n\nplasma, also may affect the ion temperature measurements. This can\n\nalso be related to space charge effects.\n\nAccording to theory, space charge effects should become less pro\xc2\xad\nnounced as the grid spacing is reduced. To look for this effect, two\n\nenergy analyzers were tested, each with a different grid spacing as\n\nshown on the analyzer schematic in figure 1. The analyzers were im\xc2\xad\n10\nmersed in a 2 inch diameter plasma of about i0 cm 3 density. A\n\n1,000 gauss field was alined with the analyzer axis. The plasma space\n\npotential was about -15v and the probe floating potential about -40v.\n\nThe analyzer aperture plate was used as a planar Langmuir probe. A\n\ncylindrical Langmuir probe was also used to determine the plasma\n\ncharacteristics.\n\nThe plasma electron temperature, as determined from both the planar\n\nand the cylindrical Langmair probes, was 8.6 ev. The cylindrical\n\nLangmuir probe gave the same electron temperature when its location\n\nwas varied from 3 to 25 mm ahead of the aperture plate. Changing the\n\npotential of the aperture plate did not change the temperature deter\xc2\xad\nmined by the cylindrical probe in any of its positions.\n\nThe electron temperature was also measured with the analyzers. Ana\xc2\xad\nlyzer #2 measured the same electron temperature as the Langmuir probes.\n\nThe #1 analyzer gave an electron temperature of 14 ev or roughly 1\n\ntimes higher than the Langmuir probes. Since the #2 analyzer had a\n\ngrid spacing of roughly a third of the #1 probe, we conclude that de\xc2\xad\ncreasing the grid spacing improved the accuracy in electron temper\xc2\xad\nature measurement. This trend is consistent with the space charge\n\neffects.\n\nIon temperatures determined by both analyzers are shown on figure 2\n\nas a function of aperture plate voltage. The effect of varying the\n\naperture plate voltage below the space potential is quite dramatic,\n\nespecially for analyzer #1. For analyzer #1, the measured ion temper\xc2\xad\nature varies by a factor of five over the range of aperture plate\n\nvoltages shown. This variation is reduced to a factor of two in\n\nanalyzer #2. Again we see a result that can be shown to be consis\xc2\xad\ntent with space charge effects, namely, that reducing the grid spacing\n\nreduces the variation in ion temperature measurement.\n\n\n91\nIn all of the tests care was taken to insure cleanliness of all inter\xc2\xad\nnal surfaces of the analyzers. If these surfaces are contaminated,\n\nespecially the grids, a large hysteresis effect -results. This is\n\nprobably due to charge accumulation on the dirty surfaces. In this\n\ncondition the analyzer would be unreliable.\n\nThere are two well-known one dimensional space charge models that pre\xc2\xad\ndict the above mentioned trends. In both models we assume that only\n\none species of charged particles is present. In model A the charged\n\nparticles have no initial drift velocity, only thermal motion. In\n\nmodel B the particles have an initial uniform drift velocity, but no\n\nthermal motion. In both models, the potential variation between two\n\nadjacent grids is determined from the Child-Langmuir space charge ex\xc2\xad\npressions. Between adjacent grids the charge flow is considered as\n\na current flowing between two plates. The ensuing space charge sets\n\nup a potential barrier that can affect the collected currents.\n\nTo approximate a one-dimensional energy analyzer\nwould have to be replaced by a screen. And then\noperated in a strong magnetic field, the charged\ntied tightly to the field lines, yielding a good\none-dimensional model.\n\n\nthe aperture plate\n\nif the analyzer were\n\nparticles would be\n\napproximation to a\n\n\nIn figure 3, results are presented for model A along with results for\n\na model without space charge. Figure 3 is a plot of current to the\n\ngate versus gate voltage. The charged particles had a temperature of\'\n\n7 ev and no initial drift velocity. A space charge will be set up\n\nbetween the entrance screen and the gate. If an exponential is fit\n\nto the model A curve we get a temperature.of 40 ev. Therefore, space\n\ncharge results in a temperature that is almost 6 times greater than\n\nthe true value. In our experiments analyzer #1 gave electron temper\xc2\xad\natures that were about 1 times the Langmuir probe results. Since an\n\naperture produces a pencil beam, the one-dimensional approximation\n\nused in figure 3 is probably too severe.\n\nThe results for model B are given in figure 4. In this case the\n\nplasma had zero temperature. Grid A was set at 60 volts to separate\n\nthe ions and electrons. The electrons reaching grid A therefore had\n\nzero temperature, and a uniform drift velocity equivalent to 60 ev.\n\nConsequently etgrid A we have electrons flowing toward the gate. The\n\nelectron density at grid A was assumed to be 109 cm\'3 . The current\n\ncollected on the gate is presented in figure 4 as a function of gate\n\nvoltage. If space charge were not present, the full electron current\n\nwould reach the gate for zero gate voltage as shown for the no-space\xc2\xad\ncharge curve. But since space charge does exist between grid A and\n\nthe gate, the knee is displaced. If an exponential is fit to this\n\ncurve a temperature of 38 ev is obtained. The displacement of the\n\nknee of the curve is a characteristic observed experimentally.\n\nWe have derived expressions for a new one-dimensional model where\n\nboth thermal and drift velocities are included. This was done for\n\n\n92\n\nboth a single species and a two species model. The resulting equation\n\nrequires a solution to an integral non-linear differential equation\n\nwith two point boundary conditions. A solution was obtained by con\xc2\xad\nThe single\n\nverting the problem to a single point boundary condition.\npotential point where the electric\n\nboundary condition was the minimum\nfield is zero. Figure 5 compares the results with model A for which\n\nthe drift velocity is zero. \n We see that the results for the new\n\nmodel are considerably different than those of model A. \nThe differ\xc2\xad\nence between the curves is large enough to show that the simplified\n\nto\n\nmodel does not predict the space potential sufficiently accurate\nvoltage curve for an electrostatic\n\nyield a correct current versus\nanalyzer. \n Similar results are obtained when a comparison is made\n\nwith model B.\n\n\n93\n\n\n-- ;I\n\n\'\n\n, Lt27,n,\n\n# /\n\no. .\'.\n\n4\n\n\'\n\n_\n\n__.___\n\n.16\n_\n\nA\nperture P/ate\n\n\nI..\n\nr\n\nSchematic of electro~ta\'tk\n\nnay\n\n\nn\n\n__\n51\n\nAnycer\n\nApertqrc\nFim___\na\n\n-40 -S-b\n\n-3;o\n\nC Jo-o\n\nP/ate\n\n-60-o\n\nVo/-tcae\n\n8\n\n(v)\n\n&& ect- of Aperture Plate Va/aj\nTenoera tu rC.\neas-ctre,-e>\n\n244O\nFuon ic\n\n\nAnr~\n\ne37a\nA\n\nScreen\n\nrMoSpcecaam\n\nFNa\nC~t rV-ci 1-t\n\nQ\ne-\n\nC ay\n-rac\n\nt\nUnoJ\n\net.\n\n94\n\n5paC\xc2\xad\n\nchare\n\n7\n\n80\nI ,ooo 4asmgo\n\n38evA\n\n60\n100\n\n80C.0\n\nAc\n40\n\nT = I=e0\n\ntmc\'\n\nc\nc-rec 1 of %Sjc\nTr\nV 7\nCctrren\n4\n\nS4.\n\nt\n\net\n\nI\n\ni-\n\n)\nAI/d/e\n\ncC\n\n,,IC\n\nI\n\nt4 /t\n\nct,=o\n\n(1v4aeI\n\nA)\n\not\n\nS\n\nS\n\nC\n\n=1\n\n()\n\npo - B et i c,e~\n\nl Plte\nic-d\n\n95\nCALCULATIONS OF ION-CYCLOTRON WAVE PROPERTIES IN A HOT PLASMA\n\nby Donald R. Sigman, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nIn the past, a Fourier integral technique was used to calculate electric\nand magnetic wave fields excited in an infinitely long plasma column by\nthe current of a finite length radiofrequency coil. To solve the Fourier\nintegral using the residue method, it was necessary to find the roots of\na complicated function of the axial wave number, i\'(h) . This could be\ndone with little diffjc Ity when the plasma was cold with no damping, so\nthat the roots of\nM\n= 0 were real.\nHowever, in a hot plasma (or one dominated by collisions) the terms mak\xc2\xad\ning up Tr(k are complex and the roots are likewise complex. In this\n\ncase it is often difficult to find a numerical technique to locate the\n\nroots quickly and easily. To avoid this difficulty with roots, one can\n\nuse a Fourier series approach. For a finite length system of length 2L)\n\nthe fields can be written as a Fourier series as follows\n\na(-t\n\n1c,\n\ne1COL\n\nn:O~\n\nThe function\n-)\nis either a sine or cosine function of argument\nnYT&/I. orflT%/aL -depending on whether the current distribution in the\n\ncoil is asymmetric or symmetric about Z = 0 and on whether open circuit\n\nor short circuit boundary conditions are assumed at the ends of the\n\nplasma column (Z =\n + L). ECi-O0\nis the Fourier transform of the\n\nelectric field evaluated at k hl/L or K = n1/2L again depending on\nthe end boundary conditions.\nThe solutions of the Fourier series and integral techniques become iden\xc2\xad\ntical when the damping is sufficient to damp the normal modes in a dis\xc2\xad\ntance short compared to L. But the important point is that roots of\n\nr(+ = 0 do not have to be found when using the series method.\n\nThe series method has been used to calculate fields and power transfer\n\nto the plasma for conditions favorable for the generation of ion-cyclo\xc2\xad\ntron waves (i.e. W*\'-t ). The coil used was a Stix coil and the\n\neffects of varying ion and electron temperatures were studied. It has\n\nbeen found that whenever ion or electron temperature is increased the\n\nefficiency of transferring energy to the plasma waves is-reduced. This\n\neffect becomes appreciable when the damping length of the natural modes\n\nis of the order of, or less than, the coil length. When temperatures\n\nare high the electron density for which optimum coupling occurs is\n\nhigher. In addition, the use of shorter Stix coil wavelengths reduces\n\nthe coupling, while increased ion temperature anisotropy (TaTi )\n\nimproves coupling for a fixed -rZ . The effect of reduced efficiency\n\nwith increasing temperature may explain why efficiency goes down with\n\nincreasing coil current in experiments at the Lewis Research Center.\n\n\nMODEL FOR THE CALCULATIONS\n\n\n/-GRID \t\n,,\n\nSTIX\n\nCOIL --7\n\nS.S. \t TEST SECTION _PLASMA\n\n/COIL\n\nGRID-\\\n\nCOLUN\n\nCURRENT DISTRIBUTION\n\nPEAK POWER TRANSFER TO PLASMA VERSUS ELECTRON\n\nDENSITY WITH ION-TEMPERATURE AS A PARAMETER\n\nTi,\n30 -eV\n\n\n301\n\no\n\n10\n\n\n\'0 1000\n\n20\n\nPLASMA RADIUS\n\nPEAK\nPOER,\nPOWER)\nkW\n\n10\nI0\n/\n\n--/\n\npDEUTERIUM\n\n4CM\n\nCOIL RADIUS =7.5 CM\nCOIL WAVELENGTH = 41 CM\nCOIL CURRENT -.100 A\nGAS\nWAVE FREQ-- 40. 8 MHz\n\n0\n\n1011\n\n12\n10\n\nELECTRON DENSITY.

Swett, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nAn experimental program is being conducted to study the ion-cyclotron\xc2\xad\nwave method of producing high ion temperatures in a hydrogen or deute\xc2\xad\nrium plasma. In this method waves are propagated in the plasma along\n\nan axial magnetic field into a region of slightly lower magnetic field\n\n(called the magnetic-beach region) where the wave energy is converted\n\ninto thermal energy of the ions. This method is capable of heating\n\nions to the kilo-electron-volt range.\n\nThe magnetic-field and vacuum-chamber configuration used is shown in\n\nFigure 1. It consists of an rf center-section with two side-arms in\n\na magnetic-mirror geometry. A 45 kW rf transmitter, operated at 6.5\n\nmegahertz, supplies a constant current to a Stix coil. This coil is\n\nwound so that ion-cyclotron waves propagate out both of its ends. The\n\nplasma, although initially started by a hot-cathode discharge, is main\xc2\xad\ntained by the rf alone when metal grids are located at the peaks of the\n\nmirrors. There are three ways of operating the magnetic field: flat\n\nfield, near beach, or far beach. In the beach regions the wave fre\xc2\xad\nquency will match the ioncyclotron frequency and the wave will be\n\nthermalized. .\n\nIn previous experiments the capability of transferring rf power effi\xc2\xad\nciently to the wave has been shown, the wave has been identified by\n\nmagnetic probing, and the wave has been damped in a beach. The purpose\n\nof the recent experiments has been to measure the ion temperature result\xc2\xad\ning from.damping of the wave. Ion temperatures were determined by means\n\nof coils located in the near-beach region which measured the diamagnetism\n\nof the plasma when the transmitter was unkeyed.\n\nIon temperature measurements are shown in Figure 2 for an electron den\xc2\xad\nsity of 2xi01 2 cm-3, deuterium gas, and maximum power. The wave is\n\npropagating from left to right. The magnetic field of the near beach\n\nis shown in the lower curve and the temperatures measured by 10 diamag\xc2\xad\nnetic coils are shown by the points in the upper curve. The points at\n\nwhich the operating frequency is equal to the ion-cyclotron frequency\n\nis shown as .a=1. As the wave propagates into the beach it becomes\n\ndamped and should be completely damped at the position a- = 1. Because\n\nof the local mirrors created by the beach the ions become trapped. The\n\ndata show that the highest transverse ion temperature (--500 ev) is at\n\nthe position of minimum field. The neutron flux measured at the beach\n\nwas compared with theoretical predictions to verify the temperatures\n\nmeasured.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1 \t\nClyde C.

Reece Roth, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nA photograph of the modified Penning discharge used in this experiment\n\nis shown in Fig. 1. The plasma is confined in a superconducting mag\xc2\xad\nnetic mirror apparatus with a mirror ratio of 2.5:1, and a maximum\n\nfield on the axis that can be varied up to two Tesla. The plasma is\n\n15 cm in diameter at the midplane, and can be operated in the steady\n\nstate for several hours.1 When a high DC potential is applied to the\n\nanode ring, thermalized ions of high kinetic temperature are observed\n\ncoming out through the magnetic mirrors. 1 ,2 These ions have a quite\n\naccurately Maxwellian energy distribution along a radius in velocity\n\nspace.1,2\n\nThese high ion temperatures were investigated further, with the results\n\nshown in Figure 2. The ion kinetic temperature is shown plotted as a\n\nfunction of direct-current anode voltage for four background pressures\n\nof deuterium gas. The kinetic temperature is approximately linearly\n\nproportional to the anode voltage up to the limit of the power supply\n\nused. This suggests that ions of any desired energy can be produced\n\nby going to a sufficiently high anode voltage. The only other steady\xc2\xad\nstate heating system to produce such high ion temperatures is the Burn\xc2\xad\nout-V device at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\nA retarding potential energy analyzer was used to measure the efflux of\n\nions as a function of time. Results are shown in Figure 3. The zero\n\nlevel is the baseline between pulses. The charged-particle efflux dis\xc2\xad\nplays pulsar-like sharp, narrow peaks between broad, flat minima. For\n\ndifferent plasma conditions, these pulses display fine structure,\n\nperiodic interpulses and other interesting detailed features. The\n\nparticle efflux, the light output, and the electrostatic fluctuations\n\nwere in phase at the same frequency. The light output was monitored\n\nat two axial and azimuthal stations with a pair of photomultipliers,\n\nand showed that the plasma was oscillating in unison with a single\n\nphase and frequency. Parametric variation of the plasma properties\n\nshowed that the frequency of this oscillation depended on both the\n\nelectron and neutral number densities, but not on the magnetic field.\n\nThese characteristics suggested that the oscillation in question is a\n\nnew phenomenon, and this subsequently proved to be the case. This\n\noscillation was labeled the continuity-equation oscillation, because it\n\narises as a consequence of periodic solutions to the coupled pair of\n\ncontinuity eouations for neutrals and charged particles in a slightly\n\nionized gas. ,4 The frequency is proportional to the square root of\n\nthe product of electron and neutral number densities, and is independent\n\n3 4\n\nof magnetic field. \'\nThe oscillation frequency was systematically studied as a function of\n\nthe electron and neutral number densities. Figure 4 shows the results.\n\n\n103\n\nThe observed frequency is plotted as a function of the product of rela\xc2\xad\ntive electron and neutral number density. The square root dependence\n\npredicted theoretically holds over a range of 5 orders of magnitude in\n\n5\n\nthe density product.\n\nThe following table summarizes the best temperatures, densities, and\n\nconfinement times simultaneously observed in this experiment thus far:\n\nIon Kinetic Temperature, Ti, key.................\n........\n\nElectron Kinetic Temperature, Te, eV .....\nparticle/m 3\nPlasma Number Density, ne , \n\nIon Confinement Time,\n\n.\n\n . . . \t\n\nsec ........\n\n....\n\n.\n\n.\n. .. .... . . . .\n\n5\n\n200\n\n\n2x10 1 6\n\n\n.................... .27\n\n\nThe ion temperatures listed are gratifying, but the densities and con\xc2\xad\nfinement times are quite low. These are now limited by the rapid loss\n\nof ions out the mirrors. Confinement time and density can be improved\n\nwith a closed configuration such as the bumpy torus. This consists of\n\n12 magnetic mirrors end-to-end in a toroidal array. Such a supercon\xc2\xad\nducting magnet facility is presently under consideration for future\n\nuse in this experiment. The modified Penning discharge scheme will\n\nbe applied to this configuration. It is one of the few steady-state\n\nplasma injection and heating schemes capable of being applied to a\n\ntoroidal geometry. A reasonable goal for the bumpy torus would be an\n\nincrease of a factor of 10 in confinement time and number density.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nI \tJ. R.

Himmell, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nA theoretical analysis was performed to determine the effect of finite\n\nbeta on electromagnetic modes propagating perpendicular to a uniform\n\nmagnetic field in a fully ionized plasma described by a loss-cone\n\ndistribution. The theory includes the effects of all components of\n\nthe four vector potential.\nIt was found that finite beta creates new\n\nresonant mode instabilities which propagate at frequencies that are\n\nvery close to the ion cyclotron frequency and its harmonics. The\n\ntheory was applied to the Dory-Guest distribution functions which are\n\nof the form\na\n\n\nand predicted unstable waves with growth rates as large as a few percent\n\nof the ion cyclotron frequency for a value of beta of one-half.\n\nThe dispersion relation describing resonant modes near the ion cyclotron\n\nfrequency for example is of the following form:\n\n\n000)CK)\n+\nwhere\n\nVC,\n\n1\n\n(2)\n\n2~\n\n\nThe propagation vector is denoted by k while pJiPO, , W\nand C refer to\n\nthe ion plasma frequency, the ion cyclotron frequency, the complex fre\xc2\xad\nquency of the wave and the speed of light respectively. The term involv\xc2\xad\ning ol (I)is the usual electrostatic contribution to the dispersion\n\n0\nrelation while the second term on the right side of the equation gives\n\nthe finite beta effect. Since the functions 1)A\nand k*Cx) are second\n\nand thi.rd degree polynomials in x respectively, Eqn. (2) can be solved\n\nanalytically for x.\n\nAn analysis was made of the distributions corresponding to the first\n\nfour values of j for\n! 0.5. When\\= 0.5 for example, the j = I and\n\nj = 4 distributions are stable while the j = 2 distribution is unstable.\n\nGrowth rates of the order of a few percent were found for\n= 0.5.

Noon, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N. Y.\n\nA hollow cathode gas-fed arc facility has been used at Rensselaer to\n\ncarry out correlation measurements on low frequency instabilities in a\n\nhighly ionized argon plasma. Study of the higher frequency oscillations\n\nwhich are not of a coherent nature is planned.\n\nA schematic of the arc and associated instrumentation is shown in Fig.\n\n1. The actual construction is easily varied for different experiments. The\n\ndischarge vessel is fabricated of 6 inch inner diameter pyrex pipe sections.\n\nThe cathode is a hollow-bariated tungsten cylinder. Gas can be introduced\n\nthrough cathode or anode. The electrode separation can be adjusted over a\n\nrange of one meter. Axial and radially movable Langmuir probes measure\n\nsteady state plasma parameters and perturbations in charged particle density\n\nand plasma potential. An axial magnetic field of up to 2000 gauss is sup\xc2\xad\nplied using 12" inner diameter solenoid coils. By powering the coil in the\n\nneighborhood of the cathode independently, the magnetic field in this region\n\nBc can be varied with respect to the main magnetic field B H \'\n\nFig. 2 shows how the amplitude (V) and frequency (f) of the dominant\ncoherent instability (an ion acoustic wave) are affected by B and p. This\nwave can be suppressed entirely by increasing p or by increasing B rela\xc2\xad\ntive to B .\nA similar effect has been reported in the MPD arc by workers\nat Langley. Fig. 3 shows changes in floating potential V and in plasma\npotential V (calculated knowing the electron temperature5 which occur when\nthe wave ispsuppressed. The plasma potential must be positive with respect\nto the cathode for onset of the instability. The enhanced loss of electrons\nfrom the core could be due to either increased axial losses or radial losses,\nbut all our data is consistent with an increased rate of radial plasma\ntransport.\nAnother coherent instability (a drift wave) close in frequency to the\n\nion acoustic wave appears to have littlb effect on plasma losses. This can\n\nbe explained in terms of the phase difference 0 between the perturbed\n\ncharged particle density and the fluctuations in plasma potential. A dif\xc2\xad\nference of /2 is found between the two cases. A theoretical dispersion\n\nrelation has been developed to predict the growth rate and frequency depen\xc2\xad\ndence of these oscillations as a function of B and p and to explain the\n\neffect of gas pressure on 0.\n\nBohm or anomalous diffusion is usually attributed to fluctuating elec\xc2\xad\ntric fields which are not of a coherent nature. To establish the effect of\n\ngeneral plasma turbulence requires a wider range of pressure and magnetic\n\nfield than those studied up to the present, and the use of both auto-corre\xc2\xad\nlation and cross-correlation measurements of axially separated probes. It\n\nis hoped to establish by these measurements, correlating the spectra of\n\ndensity fluctuations and electrostatic field fluctuations, whether a cas\xc2\xad\ncade in wave number space leads to a universal turbulent spectrum, irrespec\xc2\xad\ntive of the means used to excite turbulence in the plasma medium. A tech\xc2\xad\nnique for measuring the form of the energy distribution of the charged par\xc2\xad\nticles is also under investigation.\n\n\nVp\n\nCATHODE\n\nANODE\n\nI to 6-MOVABLE\n\n3\n5\n\nI\n\no\n\nd\n\nPROBES\n\nvf\n\n"7\n\nV2\n\nSPER\n\n1.0\n\nIn\n\nt\n\nI\n\nr=o\no0FIG\np=<1074 torr\n\nC\n\n3\n\nFG2\n\nV\n2\n\n<\n_j\n\nLB=0__4 V\n-gauss\n\n15\n\n1-4-2 at wave onset\n\nN0\n\n2_1\n\n0.5\xc2\xad\nP\n\ntor\n\n1\n\n-4\n\nto5\n\nI\n\n-.\n\nI 2\nMANEr\n\n0\n\n500\n\n4\n\n3\n(cm)\n\n1000\n\nMAGNETIC\n\nFIELD\n\n1500\n\n(gauss)\n\n2000\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n112\nTHEORY FOR PLASMA INSTABILITIES IN MPD ACCELERATORS\n\nAND BARIUM CLOUDS\n\nJohn J. Kim\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nMPD Accelerators.- This study is concerned with a theoretical evalua\xc2\xad\ntion of the experiments for onset at a critical magnetic field of rotating 2 3\n\ndisturbances in the Linear Hall Current Accelerator\' (LHA) and the MPD Arc.\n\nThe evaluation mainly concerns the theories for the E x B instability 4 ,5 and\n\nthe electrothermal instability.6 The applicability of other mechanisms7 ,8\n\nand acoustic wave instabilities have not yet been explored. The E x B\n\ninstability is attractive since in the LHA where measurements inside the\n\nelectrode region could be performed the onset of the instability occurs in a\n\nregion of large density gradient (near the cathode). It is also important\n\nthat the necessary condition, E \xe2\x80\xa2 dn /dx > 0, for the onset of the E x B\n\ninstability, 4 ,5 seems to be satisfiedo although further measurements are\n\nrequired to obtain full assurance of the electric field E near the cathode.\n\nOn the other hand the frequency characteristics of the rotating disturbance\nas .afunction of the applied magnetic field seems to be in better agreement\nwith the electrothermal instability.6 The variation of onset with mass flow\n(or pressure) and molecular weight is approximately satisfied for both types\n\nof instabilities. 4\' 5\' 6 Another criterion for the distinction between the\n\ntwo instabilities is the observation of a helical type of disturbance in the\n\nLHA. Sufficiently detailed measurements inside the electrode region of the\n\nMPD arc would have to be performed to identify a comparable helical shape.\n\nThe theories for the E x B instability 4\' 5 do not explicitly predict a helix,\n\nalthough an intuitive nonlinear generalization of the analysis appears to be\n\nconsistent with this result. The electrothermal instability theory as applied\n\nto the WPD arc,6 however, does predict a helical instability in the following\n\nmanner. The theory 6 deduces two disturbance modes, one purely rotating and\n\nthe other a mixed mode which combines a rotational and a radial wave in the\n\ndirection of the electric field. The analysis of the mixed mode is not\n\npursued in the analysis 6 to its fullest extent since the experiment for the\n\ninterelectrode region of the MPD arc only shows the rotational disturbance.\n\n(Note: The helical disturbance observed in the exhaust of the MD arc has\n\nits axis in the flow direction but not in the radial direction.) The helical\n\ndisturbance observed in the LEA can be interpreted as a mixed mode consisting\n\nof a rotational wave and axial wave in the electric field direction. It is\n\nalso of importance that only the mixed mode6 analysis predicts the onset of\n\nan instability, whereas the single rotational mode analysis does not yield\n\nan onset. The experimental results from the LHA1 thus permit a more detailed\n\ncheck of the theory for electrothermal instability. 6 The theory 6 gives the\n\ncorrect pitch of the helix. Experiments and electrothermal instability\n\ntheories for striations observed in rectangular geometries 9 (related to MHD\n\ngenerators) need to be further analyzed to evaluate their relevance to the\n\nexperiments in the LHA and the MPD arc.\n\n\n*NRC-NASA Resident Research Associate\n\n\n113\n\n\nAnother means for comparison between the two instabilities is under\n\ninvestigation which concerns their growth rates and motion as predicted\n\nby linear analysis. The growth rates and motion of disturbances will be\n\ncompared with the results of pulsed experiments. The nonlinear post onset\n\nconditions, involving arc columns or spokes, of the E x B and electro\xc2\xad\nthermal and other instabilities must be evaluated in detail to permit a\n\nbetter comparison with experiments.\n\nBarium Clouds.- Attempts have been made to explain the striation phenom\xc2\xad\ni\nenon \t n barium clouds released in the upper atmosph rel on the basis of the\n\ndissipative E x B instability as developed by Simon which involves collisions\n\nwith neutrals. An application of the E x B instability to the barium cloud\n\nhas recently been reported. 3 Striations have, however, also been observed at\n\n4\nIt is\n\nvery high altitudes (12 to 13 earth radii) in a recent experiment.\nsuggested that a possible origin of these high altitude striations could be\n\nthe drift wave instabilities 5 which do not depend on collisions with neutrals.\n\nThese instabilities have been thoroughly studied experimentally and theoreti\xc2\xad\ncally in the fusion program. The flute-like disturbances due to these drift\n\nwave instabilities could be used for interpretation of the striations in the\n\nbarium clouds. It is then of special interest that the wave fronts of drift\n\ni\nwave \tnstabilities may be alined with the magnetic field or have an angle to\n\nit. The experimental observations need to be refined to evaluate their angle\n\nwith respect to the magnetic field. The extension of the E x B instability\n\nto the collisionless case (including inertial effects) will also be explored.\n\nThe drift motion of the barium cloud is primarily used to study strength\n\nand direction of electric fields in the magnetosphere. In the cases where\n\nstriations are found the cloud drift motion (and the electric fields) would\n\nlikely be judged by the motion of the striations. The angle of the\n\nmost \t\nstriations with respect to the magnetic field is then of considerable import\xc2\xad\nance for the interpretation of electric fields.

Talwar*\n\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nThe hydromagnetic stability of a multicomponent system composed of\n\ninfinitely conducting gravitating fluids is investigated by the normal\n\nmode analysis. The effects of hydromagnetic and gravitational coupling\n\nbetween the components are studied in an initially static and a contra\xc2\xad\nstreaming configuration. It is found that an N-component static nongravi\xc2\xad\ntating system allows, in general, (N+I) mixed magnetosound modes in addition\n\nto a purely Alfven mode. The gravitational coupling results in an insta\xc2\xad\nbility leading to an incipient fragmentation, whose size depends profoundly\n\non nonthermalization in the composite medium. Finally, the conditions of\n\ncontrastreaming instability in plasma-plasma and neutral gas-plasma\n\ngravitating streams are derived in view of their likely importance to star\n\nformation from primordial matter.\n\n\nNRC-NASA Resident Research Associate\n\n\nTRANSVERSE INSTABILITIES IN SELF-FOCUSING STREAMS\n\n\nby\n\nWillard H. Bennett\n\nNorth Carolina State UnivPrsity\n\nBroadly stated, the objective in this program has been to investi\xc2\xad\ngate the instabilities in magnetically self-focusing streams in which\n\nthe mean free paths of the stream electrons are more than several orders\n\nof magnitude longer than the stream diameter and magneto-hydrodynamic\n\nmethods of analysis cannot be applied. Electron beams have been pro\xc2\xad\nduced which are electrically pinched in order to insure complete\n\nneutralization of the beam electron space charge, and the current and\n\nvoltage were then to be increased until the conditions for the magnetic\n\npinch were satisfied, whereupon the instabilities could be studied.\n\nA directional probe which has been developed recently a this Laboratory\n\nhas been used for measuring the radial potential distribution in and\n\naround these pinches.\n\nUsing the value of energy of transverse motion, B, as measured\n\nin high voltage beams, the current required for the-magnetic pinch to\n\nbecome dominant appears to be about the same as the maximum current\n\nwhich has been obtainable in these experiments with our present equip\xc2\xad\nment. There have been several instances when it appeared that the beam\n\npinched to a smaller radius than could be expected with an electric\n\npinch alone. However, in order to make an adequate study of these\n\nbeams and their instabilities, it will be necessary to make measure\xc2\xad\nments at current values up to much more than the minimum critical\n\npinch current.\n\n\nCASCADE MECHANISM OF NONLINEAR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN\n\nMODES IN A TURBULENT PLASMA\n\n\nC. M. Tchen\n\n\nThe City College of the City University of New York\n\n\nBy means of a hydrodynamic model, valid for a plasma of hot elect\xc2\xad\nrons and cold ions, we have established the development of spectra of kinetic\n\nand electrostatic energies. The nonlinear interactions have been described by\n\ntwo transfer functions valid for the nonlinear transfer of modes across each\n\nspectrum, and by a production function serving the coupling between the two\n\nspectra. The closure problem, as characteristic to any nonlinear system, has\n\nof course to be solved, and in the present theory, the approximation is resort\xc2\xad\ned to the cascade concept. The concept helped in the derivation of the equa\xc2\xad\ntions for the energy spectra, and in the formulation of a "turbulent relaxa\xc2\xad\ntion frequency". The latter frequency is very important in determining the\n\nstructure of turbulent transport coefficients entering in all the above non\xc2\xad\nlinear transport phenomena. Finally the equations of energy spectra are\n\nsolved for the collisional and collisionless cases. Some of the theoretical\n\ntesults have been confirmed by experiments in gas plasmas. The spectra of\n\nkinetic and electrostatic energies are investigated for both the collisional\n\nand collisionless cases. In the former case, the spectrum of potential energy\n\nfrom the electrostaticpotential fluctuations, as a function of the wave number\n\n3\nk, and denoted by G(k) follows the laws Gk -\n / 2 and k-9/2 in the inertial and\n\ndissipative subranges respectively. In the latter case, the dissipative law\n\nG,/k - 5\n is derived. The solutions of the kinetic energy spectrum are also\n\nfound. The anomalous diffusion, called the Bohm diffusion, is derived in the\n\npresent theory, and is found to play a role of a sink of energy flux across a\n\npotential spectrum.\n\n\n# -3\n\n\n119\n\nMEASUREMENTS OF THE COHERENT OSCILLATIONS AND TURBULENCE\n\nIN PLASMA USING RESISTIVELY- AND CAPACITIVELY-COUPLED PROBES\n\nby John S. Serafini, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nThe knowledge of the diffusive and other transport properties of a plasma\n\ndepends upon the experimental study of plasma turbulence and oscilla\xc2\xad\ntions. Fluctuating plasma parameters which need to be measured include\n\nthe particle densities- the potentials and/or fields. The writer\'s\n\nprevious work (Refs. I and 2) used resistively-coupled electrostatic\n\n(Langmuir) probes to sense the plasma fluctuations. These fluctuations\n\nexhibited both coherent-like and random-like properties. The writer\'s\n\npresent work \'isa continuation of these studies which additionally\n\nemploys an electrostatic probe capacitively coupled to the plasma (such\n\nas one described by J. A. Schmidt in Ref. 3). The fluctuations sensed\n\nby this type of probe are considered to be fluctuations in potential.\n\nThe measurements have been obtained in a crossed-field plasma source\n\n(axial electric and radial magnetic fields) with a slightly ionized,\n\nlow current, low-pressure argon discharge employing a hot cathode. The\n\nplasma had an average electron temperature of about 10 ev and an aver\xc2\xad\n.\n\nage electron number density of about 5.0 X 1OlO cm-3\n\nAmplitude spectra from .1kilohertz to 6 megahertz as well as the auto\xc2\xad\ncorrelations which have been obtained allow comparison of the density\n\nand potential fluctuations. The spectra obtained with both types of\n\nprobes contain a peak indicative of the coherent oscillation and are\n\notherwise generally similar. At the higher frequencies the spectra\n\nobtained with the two types of probes do not agree in slope. Possible\n\nreasons for the observed similarities and dissimilarities in the spec\xc2\xad\ntra are discussed.\n\nPrevious work on the space-time correlations found that the coherent\n\npart of the current-density fluctuations were well-correlated over the\n\nmeasured range. The present work on correlations provides a like result\n\nfor the potential fluctuations sensed by capacitively-coupled probes.\n\nIn addition correlations of the potential fluctuations sensed by capac\xc2\xad\nitively-coupled probes with the current-density fluctuations sensed with\n\na resistively-coupled probe indicate strong correlations near the fre\xc2\xad\nquency of the coherent oscillation. The effect of the turbulent-like\n\npart of the fluctuations is also observed to be present in all of the\n\ncorrelation results. It appears as minor peak in the curves of the\n\ncorrelation coefficient versus time-delay at values of time-delay near\n\nzero.\n\nAlso presented are spectra of measurements of the fluctuations from two\n\ncapacitively-coupled probes being sensed differentially. These differ\xc2\xad\nential-mode spectra are compared to the spectra of the fluctuations from\n\nthe individual probes. From these results is deduced that the differ\xc2\xad\nential-mode spectra depend (I) on whether the fluctuation is due to a\n\ncoherent oscillation or is turbulent-like in\'nature at the portion of\n\n\n120\n\nthe spectrum-of interest and (2) on the temporal and spatial scales of\n\nthe fluctuations.

The micro-electric\n\nfields arise from Coulomb potentials around the plasma particles,\n\ndensity fluctuations (both thermodynamic and turbulent), and electro\xc2\xad\nmagnetic radiation. This interaction can be studied by injecting\n\ncharged particles into a plasma and observing the dynamics of these\n\n"test" particles. .The behavior of the test particles is representative\n\nof that of the "field" particles of the plasma and can be used for\n\nthe computation of plasma transport properties, spectroscopic data,\n\nas well as the trajectories of energetic particles in geophysical or\n\nastrophysical plasmas. Measurements of test particle interactions\n\nwith a plasma essentially provide a direct experimental test of\n\nplasma kinetic theory which has been formulated for many years and\n\nhas been generally accepted without direct proof.\n\nAn earlier experiment1 indicated that the energy loss of 5 to 10\n\nKeV proton test particles losing energy to a fully ionized lithium\n\nplasma is less than predicted by 40 to 50%. Unfortunately, the\n\nexperimental error was of the same order as the energy discrepancy,\n\nand a more precise measurement is necessary for a good comparison.\n\nAn experimental program is now underway at EEC which will measure\n\nthe energy loss of fast protons injected into a lithium plasma of\n\nknown properties. The plasma is formed by a magnetically confined\n\nreflex arc with electron density of 5 x 1012 cm-3 and electron\n\ntemperature of about 1.5 eV. The test protons, with energies from\n\n1 to 20 KeV, interact mainly with the plasma electrons and lose\n\nenergy at the rate of a few eV per cm of plasma traversed. The main\n\nexperimental problem is the very small energy loss of the test particles\n\nin the plasma.\n\nA method has been devised to increase the effective path length\n\nof the test particles in the plasma. (See Figure 1.) Fast neutral\n\nhydrogen atoms are passed through the magnetically confined lithium\n\narc and a fraction of the neutrals are ionized by charge exchange\n\ncollisions in the plasma. The resultant protons are captured by the\n\nmagnetic field and lose energy in the part of the gyro-orbits which\n\nis in the plasma column. The proton orbits drift tangentially around\n\nthe arc column because of the radial gradient of the confining\n\nmagnetic field, and the average proton energy will be related to the\n\nangular position of the orbit gyrocenters. The captured protons are\n\nlost mainly by charge exchange in the plasma, and an energy analysis\n\nof the particles lost from a narrow angular region of the arc column\n\nwill show a series of peaks. (See Figure 2.) The energy difference\n\nbetween two consecutive peaks of the energy spectrum will represent\n\nthe energy loss during a complete precession of the captured proton\n\ngyrocenters around the arc axis. The peak widths are related to\n\nthe energy dispersion of the test particles in the plasma.\n\n\n125\n\nAt present, all of the major experimental components have been\n\nconstructed and are undergoing tests in the laboratory. A first\n\ntest with the lithium arc, neutral particle accelerator, and neutral\n\nparticle energy analyzer operating simultaneously was successfully\n\nconducted recently. Measurements of test particle energy loss will\n\nbegin as soon as the microwave interferometer bridge for plasma\n\ndensity measurement and a system for measuring the captured proton\n\nprecession rate are put into operation.\n\n\n1. \tW.

Demetriades, G. S. Argyropoulos, and G. Fonda-Bonardi\nSTD Research Corporation, Pasadena, California\nABSTRACT\nThe properties and behavior of an electrical discharge perpendicular\nto a plasma stream can be influenced by introducing gasdynamic turbulence\nof controlled properties in the flow. This study has shown analytically\n(Ref. i) that fine-grained, intense turbulence can prevent the formation of\narc filaments, and has verified experimentally that such turbulence can\nincrease the conductance of the discharge channel. Four areas are currently\nunder investigation:\ni. Measurement of the increase of cross-arc conductance Z as a\nfunction of turbulence parameters under different operating conditions.\nThe scale and intensity of introduced turbulence are being controlled by\nmeans of different wire screens placed in the plasma stream. Preliminary\nresults shown on Fig. i illustrate the substantial increase of conductance\nthat is obtained when turbulence is introduced.\n2. Measurement of the relative erosion rate of the electrodes.\nThis investigation was started very recently and only incomplete results\nare available. It appears that turbulence promotes a much more uniform\nerosion of the electrode (cathode) surface, and that the arc is not attached\nto a small area, but is either diffuse or moves very rapidly and evenly\nover the entire surface of the electrode. Anode erosion is negligible with\nor without turbulence in the stream. The net amount of material removed\nfrom the electrodes appears larger in the presence of turbulence. This\nmay be due to higher surface temperatures because of enhanced heat\ntransfer to the electrodes through the turbulent boundary layer, since in\nthe few tests made the flow of coolant water was maintained constant.\nAlso, this effect depends on the operating conditions, in particular the\nchamber pressure and the plasma enthalpy and velocity,\n3. Measurement of turbulence properties (in particular, turbulent\ncell dimensions and density fluctuations) and correlation to the observed\nconductance enhancement. Turbulence properties are determined by\nmeans of a laser interferometer which measures the average (integrated)\nrefractive index along a thin cylinder transverse to the plasma flow. A\nspecial arrangement permits simultaneous duplication of the measurement\nalong two parallel paths which can be displaced with respect to each other\nalong the axis of the plasma jet, from zero to 3 cm; this is equivalent to\ntwo identical, parallel interferometers each having an independent detector.\n\nAnalysis of the detected signals permits computation of the decorrelation\nintervals of the turbulence parameters both as functions of time interval\nat a fixed distance, or as functions of distance at a fixed time interval.\n\nFigure ? shows a schematic diagram of the double interferometer.\n\n128\n\n4. Analytical and theoretical studies relating to the interpretation\nof the experimental results and the prediction of model performance. The\ntheory of the phenomenon aid a general dispersion criterion have been\ndeveloped (Ref. i): Prevention and/or dispersion of arc filaments by tur\xc2\xad\nbulence is accomplished when the sufficient condition D? > I is satisfied,\n-where D 2 depends on the plasma properties, the operating conditions,\nand the turbulence scale and intensity. Computation of Dz under the\noperating conditions of the experiments is obtained by utilizing computer\nprograms that have been developed at STD Research Corporation in the\npast for the detailed analysis and prediction of plasma properties in MHD\nflows (Refs. 2 and 3). Results of these computations are shown on\nFigs. 3 and 4 for two different levels of turbulence intensity. These\nresults indicate that turbulence is more effective in dispersing arc fila\xc2\xad\nments at lower are pressures and electron temperatures and are in excellent\nagreement with the experimental measurements.\nREFERENCES\ni.

Staton\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nThe release of an artificially produced, ionized barium, pldsma cloud\n\ninto the earth\'s magnetosphere initiates several transitory physical processes\n\nof both theoretical and practical interest. The initial phases include the\n\nionization of the initially deposited neutral barium atoms and the expansion\n\nof the resulting plasma blob in a spherically symmetrical fashion until a\n\nsize is reached at which there occurs a rough balance between the gas pressure\n\nwithin the plasma and the effective pressure of the magnetic field. During\n\nthis period and for some time subsequent to it the plasma cloud as a whole\n\nis moving with respect to both the magnetic field and the ambient magneto\xc2\xad\nspheric plasma, because of the initial velocity imparted to the cloud by the\n\nspace vehicle which released it. It is only after the cloud has come to rest\n\nwith respect to the magnetospheric plasma that optical tracking methods can\n\nbe used to measure the cloud velocity and from this velocity to allow the\n\ndeduction of the ambient, steady, electric-field component perpendicular to\n\nthe magnetic field.\n\nThe time required for the synchronization of the transverse cloud velocity\n\nwith that of the ambient plasma (i.e. the time required for "attachment" of\n\nthe cloud to the field lines) is of practical interest because of its import\xc2\xad\nance in designing such an experiment. The physical processes responsible for\n\nthis synchronization are of theoretical interest for both fundamental plasma\n\nphysics and magnetospheric physics. Theoretical effort to date in describing\n\nthese processes has taken three approaches. Common to all three is the idea\n\nthat the relative motions among the magnetic field lines, the plasma cloud,\n\nand the ambient magnetospheric plasma are capable of launching disturbances\n\nwhich may be propagated along and guided by the magnetic field lines.\n\nThe first approach recognizes that the polarization electric field which\n\nis induced in the cloud by its relative motion with respect to the B field is\n\ncapable of driving electric currents through that electric circuit composed\n\nof the magnetic lines passing through the opposite (charged) faces of the\n\ncloud and of a highly conducting path connecting these same lines within the\n\nionosphere. These currents are carried down one of these lines and up the\n\nother by electrons of the ambient magnetospheric plasma, which have very\n\nhigh mobility along the lines. In this way the kinetic energy of the rela\xc2\xad\ntive cloud motion is dissipated in ionospheric heating. A central feature\n\nof the model is that the "transmission line" for these currents is filled\n\nwith the magnetospheric plasma, which has an effective dielectric constant\n\nhigh enough to reduce the electromagnetic propagation velocity to the level\n\nof the Alfven velocity.\n\n\n134\n\n\nA second, more rigorous approach is to seek solutions of the MHD\n\nequation for a related, mathematically tractable, problem in an attempt to\n\ngage the validity of the model described above. It is possible to- obtain\n\na rigorous, one-dimensional formulation of an MHD problem in which an\n\ninfinitely long strip-like current source in the x-y plane (with the\n\ncurrent flow across the strip) excites a pure MlD wave propagating along\n\nthe z-axis. Unfortunately, the one-dimensional character of the solutions\n\nis destroyed if the source strip is truncated to finite size. This fact\n\nimplies that a correction must be added to the first model above to account\n\nfor the inevitable divergence of some energy away from the direction of the\n\ntransmission line.\n\nThe third approach, one which was originally proposed by workers at\n\nthe Max Planck Institute, ignores the polarization electric field and instead\n\nregards the magnetic field lines as frozen into both the magnetospheric and\n\ncloud plasmas. As the cloud moves the lines are then distorted, resulting\n\nin a magnetic disturbance which propagates down the field lines with Alfven\n\nvelocity. The magnetospheric plasma is then disturbed with the result that\n\nthe cloud relative momentum becomes shared with the particles of the magneto\xc2\xad\nspheric plasma.\n\nContinued work is required since,at present, theoretical values of the\n\nsynchronization, or attachment, time for the computing models are very nearly\n\nequal, allowing no certain description of the physical processes involved.\n\n\n135\n\nCOMPUTER SIMULATION OF ExPANSION OF IONIZED BARIUM CLOUD\n\nPERPENDICULAR TO THE EARTH\'S MAGNETIC FIELD LINES\n\nF. C. Grant\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nThe elongated form of the ionized barium cloud suggests that the motion\n\ntransverse to the Earth\'s magnetic field be modelled by the two-dimensional\n\nmotion of a large number of infinitely long rods of charge with appropriate\n\nmasses. A computer program based on the work of Hohl and Hockney has been\n\nprepared to simulate the cloud\'s transverse motion. A more precise treatment\n\nof the dynamics has been introduced so that the treatment of the electronic\n\nrods exactly parallels that of the ionic rods.\n\nLarge amounts of computing time are required for the simulation, so a\n\nprime concern is to use the smallest number of rods consistent with good\n\nsimulation. \n Another primary concern is to use the proper initial conditions.\n\nThese two matters are subjects of parametric study.\n\nWhen the cloud is subdivided into a sufficiently large number of small\n\ncharged masses and they are properly started, the subsequent transverse\n\nmotion provides a measure (when compared to observed cloud motion) of the\n\nexcitiug magnetic field fluctuations, or turbulence, of the Earth\'s magnetic\n\ntield. The effect of magnetic field fluctuations on the transverse diffusion\n\nmay be estimated theoretically.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Sundaram\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nA detailed discussion on the radiation characteristics of an electric\n\ndipole embedded in an infinite homogeneous, anisotropic, compressible\n\nplasma is made. The cases treated include the effects of Hall and electron\n\ninertia terms in the generalized Ohm\'s law and finite pressure in the momen\xc2\xad\ntum equation. The investigation bridges the gap between the MHD and the\n\nconventional magnetoionic theories on radiation from electromagnetic sources.\n\nMathematically, the far fields are obtained using a simple procedure out\xc2\xad\nlined in the analysis which deviates from the existing theory,1 and it is\n\nshown that the method has some advantage in obtaining the radiation resistance.\n\nFrom physical point of view, the directional distribution of waves excited\n\nfrom the dipole source is discussed when Hall and electron inertia effects\n\nare included and the results thus derived hold good for all frequencies,\n\nparticularly for frequencies comparable to ion cyclotron frequency. The\n\nvalidity of the theQry is also examined in detail for a special case when\n\nE+VxB=O, as usually treated in the literature.\n\nReference\n\n1. Lighthill, M. J.:\n\nPhil. Trans. Roy. Soc.

Chubb, NASA Lewis Research Center\n\nA laboratory simulation experiment of the interaction of the solar wind\n\nand the earth\'s magnetic field is being conducted at NASA-Lewis. The\n\nplasma flow is produced by an MPD arc and a magnetic dipole is used to\n\nsimulate the earth"s magnetic field.\n\nPreliminary results were encouraging. Regions, of intense light were\n\nobserved in locations simiTar to those of the earth\'s radiation belts.\n\nA short movie will be presented of these preliminary results. Although\n\nthese results are encouraging significant improvements are necessary to\n\nobtain a proper simulation of the solar wind-earth magnetosphere inter\xc2\xad\naction. Density and velocity requirements necessary to obtain a proper\n\nsimulation will be discussed. These requirements result from the fol low\xc2\xad\ning simulation criteria:\n(1) bow shock thickness less than shock stand\xc2\xad\noff distance; (2) stagnation magnetic field twice field for undisturbed\n\ndipole; (3) collisional mean free paths greater than dimensions of experi\xc2\xad\nment; and (4) hypersonic flow.\n\nIn addition to the simulation criteria, diagnostic results of a colli\xc2\xad\nsionless stagnation flow will be presented. These diagnostics consist\n\nof plasma potential and magnetic field measurements.

Brockman\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nThe argon ion laser offers the possibility of continuous single\n\nmode operation at high power in the visible and medium power in the UV.\n\nThere are a wide range of applications including underwater communica\xc2\xad\ntions, materials testing, and deep-space communications. Continuous\n\nargon ion lasers have been operated at output powers over 100 watts and\n\nat efficiencies up to \' 0.2 percent. Tube diameters are typically a few\n\nmillimeters but an in rease in laser power with tube diameters up to\n\n15 mm has been shown.1\n\nThe interest in argon ion lasers at Langley evolved from plasma accel\xc2\xad\nerator experiments involving various high-power nonequilibrium gas discharges\n\nat low pressures. To date the program has consisted of equipping a laboratory,\n\ndesigning and building several experiments, and beginning cooperative research\n\nwith Old Dominion University.\n\nOne experiment has consisted of looking for gain in the plume of the\n\nhontinuous MPD arc. At about the time these measurements were begun gain\n\nin a pulsed MPD arc was reported. 2 To date, both double pass balanced gain\n\nmeasurements (Fig. 1-A) and internal cavity measurements (Fig. 1-B) using a\n\npulsed TRW laser have indicated less than measurable gains ( < 1%), across\n\nthe plume. It is still possible that inversion does exist in the rotating\n\nspoke which is evident in the MPD arc for many operating conditions. Future\n\nexperiments will consist of looking for gain in the spoke using a d.c. laser\n\nas a probe and of.operating spoke free at much higher powers using the milli\xc2\xad\n3\n\nsecond pulse power supply described at this meeting.\nAdditional experiments have consisted of constructing and operating 2.7\n\nand 7 millimeter internal diameter quartz lasers. These are static filled\n\nlasers in which the fill pressure can be varied. The 7 mm i.d. laser has\n\nbeen operated at a range of pressures and currents from 15 to 30 amperes.\n\nFor these conditions performance is similar to that reported in reference 1.\n\nQuasi-steady operation at power inputs up to 1 MW will be studied using\n\nflat pulses of 1 millisec. or longer, and the limitations due to radiation\n\ntrapping will be investigated. In this manner the problems for high-power\n\nsteady lasers will be studied without involving materials problems. Efforts\n\nwill be made to obtain proper quasi-steady conditions through simulation of\n\nsteady-state conditions of the lasing plasma and of the tube walls. For\n\nexample, preheating the quasi-steady pulsed laser with a steady d.c. discharge\n\nwill be used to investigate the effect of gas temperature on radiation trapping.\n\n\n142\n\n\nAn additional laser is under construction. This is a hollow-cathode,\n\n4\n\nhollow-anode design with metal constricting apertures, (Fig. 2). In this\n\ndesign studies of high-power operation will be made and investigation of\n\npotential drop along the axis as well as a study of applying varying\n\npotential to the apertures. For operation at high input powers large\xc2\xad\ndiameter hollow cathodes which have been operated for steady operation of\n\nthe MPD arc at currents up to 900 amps will be used.\n\nThe work under the Old\'Dominion University grant will be discussed in\n\nanother talk.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nEerziger, G., and Seelig, W.: High-Efficiency Ion Lasers.

M. Nerheim+\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nPasadena, California\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSpectroscopic studies of the emission spectra of the plasma produced by an\n\nMPD arc have revealed a highly non-equilibrium distribution of the argon ion\n\nexcited states. For some operating conditions, the spectra suggested the\n\npossibility that population inversions may occur for some of the excited\n\nlevels. Furthermore, the spontaneous emission of an argon ion laser(l ) was\n\nnoted to be very similar to the spectr of the MPD arc. Because of the.simi\xc2\xad\nlarities, an investigation of the conditions necessary to produce population\n\ninversions in the MPD exhaust was started. The beam of a static argon ion\n\nlaser was directed through the flowing plasma and monitored to detect any\n\nchanges in the beam intensity. An enhancement of the beam would indicate\n\nstimulated emission and therefore an inversion of the upper and lower states\n\nof the laser line. The instrumentation was sufficiently sensitive to detect\n\na 1 change in the beam intensity. The probing laser beam was directed\n\nthrough the BPD exhaust at right angles to the flow direction, and a multiple\xc2\xad\npass mirror system was used to increase the path length in the plasma to about\n\n500 cm. The exhaust plume was probed as a function of position over a wide\n\nrange of arc operating conditions, exhaust pressure, and beam strength.\n\nNo evidence of stimulated emission was found. The method used was limited\n\nto the investigation of the normal A+ lasing lines that constitute the out\xc2\xad\nput of the probing beam, the strongest of which is the 4880 A line. Because\n\nthe lower levels of these lines are the resonant levels, direct spectro\xc2\xad\nscopic measurements of the ratio of the upper and lower levels of the transi\xc2\xad\ntion could not be made. This ratio can be measured for transitions originating\n\nfrom the higher energy levels and the study revealed the possibility of popu\xc2\xad\nlation inversions for some of these lines. However, this speculation is\n\nstrongly influenced by the accuracy of the transition probabilities used to\n\ncalculate the population densities from the measured line intensities. Be\xc2\xad\ncause of the lack of experimental values for the lines originating from the\n\nhigher energy level, the transition probabilities of a number of lines with\n\n4d upper levels were determined.

This study is being conducted in close\n\ncooperation with the Plasma Physica and Gas Laser Branch of the Aero-\n\nPhysics Division at the Langley Research Center and is intended to be a\n\njoint-effort utilizing the plasma technique experience of that group to\xc2\xad\ngether with the spectroscopic experience of the Optics and Spectroscopic\n\nGroup at Old Dominion University.\n\nPrevious investigations have been concerned with visible and near UV\n\nspectroscopic observations. However, we intend to examine resonance\n\ntransitions for sin ly ionized argon which lie in the vacuum UV region at\n\napproximately 1000 X. Since radiation trapping is believed to be a major\n\nlimitation of argon ion lasers, it seems important to examine spectral\n\nline intensities in this region which will lead to a .determination of popu\xc2\xad\nlations of the various states of the ion. This study was undertaken to\n\nimprove the technology of gas lasers and diagnostics and to examine the\n\nlasing system with the aid of spectroscopic techniques in the UV region.\n\nIt is hoped that information will also be obtained for establishing popula\xc2\xad\ntion inversions for multiply-ionized argon which may cause lasing action\n\nfor wave lengths as low as 1850 R. Parametric dependence of the operating\n\nconditions will be investigated for creating population inversion among the\n\nvarious lasing levels.\n\nLaser configurations to be investigated are both continuous and pulsed\n\ntime durations from microseconds to milliseconds. Variation of pressure,\n\ncurrent density, and capillary diameter are to be made in the course of this\n\ninvestigation.\n\nWe have conducted a preliminary investigation on a small diameter\n\ndischarge (approximately 4 -mm)for the purpose of calibrating our spectro\xc2\xad\nscopic equipment for the argon discharge application. Initial studies were\n\nconducted at relatively high pressures of approximately 1 Torr, as compared\n\nto the approximately 0.1 Torr laser working pressures at this capillary\n\ndiameter. The intent was to obtain as strong as possible line intensities\n\nduring the initial investigation to facilitate the initial orientation. The\n\nexperimental configuration used for this preliminary study of the argon ion\n\ndischarge consist of an approximately 5 cm long capillary discharge tube,\n\n4 mm in diameter, which was mounted to a 1/2 meter Seya Monochromator. Obser\xc2\xad\nvations were made from the visible region of the spectrum to approximately\n\n300 X with the aid of a dosium salicitate scintilator in front of the photo\xc2\xad\nmultiplier tube.

A computer program\n\nis used in the analysis which includes the simultaneous effects of electron\n\nheating, ionization and recombination rates, and the rates of population of\n\natomic excited states. The generalized equations for a three component fluid\n\nwith different specie temperatures are formulated using the theory of\n\nZhdanov (Ref. 1), and include a generalized Ohm\'s law and electron energy eq\xc2\xad\nuation. Electron thermal conductivity, thermal diffusion, and radiative\n\ntransport are included. Optically thin free-free and free-bound radiation\n\nlosses are calculated using the theory of Biberman, et al (Ref. 2); also\n\nincluded is the nonequilibrium thin line radiation resulting from transitions\n\nbetween excited states. The resonance transitions result in a leakage loss\n\nfrom the thin line wings plus the effect of diffusion of photons in the thick\n\nline core.\n\nA ten level hydrogen-like model is used to calculate the collisional-radiative\n\nrecombination and ionization rates, and the populations of the first ten\n\ntransition arrays of atomic argon. It is not assumed either for the case of\n\nionization or recombination that the rates of change of excited state popula\xc2\xad\ntions tend to zero as is done by Bates and Kingston (Ref. 3). Radiative\n\ntransition probabilities are calculated using the theory of Bates and\n\nDamgaard (Ref. 4).\nCollisional excitation and deexcitation cross sections\n\nare evaluated using the theory of Gryzinski (Ref. 5) for transitions permit\xc2\xad\nted by the selection rules for dipole radiation.\n\nSolutions have been obtained for constant pressure accelerator flows and for\n\nflows accelerated in divergent ducts. Depending on the initial conditions\n\nof the flow prior to acceleration, population inversions are predicted for\n\nboth the entrance and exit regions for atomic transitions in the infrared.\n\nAt the accelerator entrance the sudden increase in electron temperature leads\n\nto an inversion of the 5p-3d transition array. The predicted gain for this\n\ntransition is relatively small and would not allow oscillation in a cavity\n\nless than about one meter in length. In the exit region of the accelerator\n\nThis work represents the results of one phase of research carried out in the\n\nPropulsion Research and Advanced Concepts Section of the Jet Propulsion\n\nLaboratory, California Institute of Technology, under Contract NAS7-100,\n\nsponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n+Group Supervisor\n\n\n150\n\n\nwhere the electron temperature is rapidly decaying, electron capture associated\n\ncollisional-radiative recombination causes inversions of the 4d-5p tran\xc2\xad\nwith \t\nsition array. Depending on the final values of the electron temperature and\n\ndensity, the gain for this transition array is large enough to make it pos\xc2\xad\nsible to attain oscillation in a cavity of the order of 10 cm in length.\n\nOn the basis of these predictions, a cross field laser has been constructed\n\nat JPL to attempt to produce lasing in a cavity placed downstream of the ac\xc2\xad\ncelerator exit. In this device argon is pre-heated in four MPD arcs, ex\xc2\xad\nhausted into a water-cooled plenum chamber, and then expanded through an\n\nuncooled graphite Mach 3 nozzle. The gas then passes through a constant\n\npressure cross-field accelerator containing twenty-ond uncooled thoriated\n\ntungsten electrode pairs.

CURRENT AND PLANNED RESEARCH IN THE\n\nPLASMA PHYSICS AND GAS LASER BRANCH\n\nF. Allario, R. Lucht and R. V. Hess\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nWithin the past few years, considerable research on gasdynamic\nmolecular lasers using mixtures of CO with various gases has been per\xc2\xad\nformed with the aim of obtaining high laser power. This system although\nattractive because of its large input capability, has proven to have\nextremely low efficiency. Recently, interest in other systems capable of\nproducing high laser power has arisen because of their relatively high\nefficiency, although limited power inputs. Among these systems are 1 2 3\nelectrical discharge lasers4 ogerating in relatively high flow rates\nand chemical laser systems. \'\nIn both systems, rapid progress is being\nmade in increasing laser power per unit length and there is promise of\neven higher power input and higher efficiencies than presently available.\nIn the last six months, members of this Branch in collaboration with\n\n\'Prof. Hassan of North Carolina State University, have developed plans for\n\nresearch in molecular lasers using electrical discharges and high flow\n\nrates of CO2, H, and N mixtures. Some preliminary studies have already\n\n2 e\n2\n\nbeen performed.\n\nProfessor gassan will discuss aspects of the theoretical program at\n\nthis conference and in this paper some preliminary experimental results\n\nand plans for future work will be discussed. In figure 1, a schematic of\n\nthe apparatus used to study electrical discharge lasers with high flow rates\n\nis shown. As is indicated, a simple electrode configuration and gas injec\xc2\xad\ntion scheme were used, but results obtained indicated that an improved version\n\nwould probably be more desirable for applying greater power to the electrical\n\ndischarge. Furthermore, a convenient optical cavity was chosen but again\n\ncalculations show that the choice of an improved optical cavity could lead to\n\na substantial increase in efficiency of the system. Volume flow rates in\n\nthe one-inch-diameter tube were varied between 5 and 150 liters/min, the\n\nupper limit being set by available flow meters. Electrical power was supplied\n\nby a 100 kw (10 kv, 10 A) d.c. power supply. The laser beam showed a multi\xc2\xad\nmode structure and power was recorded with a conventional power meter. A\n\ngain-measuring system has also been assembled with an auxiliary laser to\n\nmeasure laser gain parallel and perpendicular to the flow axis.\n\nA parametric study has been performed of the variation of laser output\n\npower with flow rates of the constituents (CO\nN2, H)\nand has been re\xc2\xad\nlated to the voltage-current characteristics oi the discharge. These prelimi\xc2\xad\nnary results show that almost an order of magnitude increase in power output\n\ncan be expected by varying the flow rate considerably less than 2 orders of\n\n\n152\n\n\nmagnitude. For example, laser power was increased from less than 10\n\nwatts (efficiency n 5%) to approximately 60 watts (efficiency it 10%)\nfor a tube length of less than half a meter (18") by increasing the\n\nflow rate from 5 to 130 liters 1/min. These results by far exceed the\n\nmaximum power outputs per meter for no-flow lasers and are consistent\n\nwith recently published results in references 1 and 2, showing that\n\nconvective cooling of the gas mixture by the high flow rate helps to\n\nmaintain a low gas temperature leading to enhanced laser power. The\n\ncomparatively low efficiencies obtained (% 5% and 10%) suggests that\n\nimprovement in the optical cavity and flow uniformity are needed; at\n\nthe lower flow rates cooling of the laser tube walls is desirable.\n\nHowever, the more pertinent result for the present high flow rate experi\xc2\xad\nment is that it was possible to increase input power to the discharge by\n\nincreasing the flow rate, which for a given efficiency of course corres\xc2\xad\nponds to an increase in laser power. The inability in the present experi\xc2\xad\nment to obtain further increase in laser power arises from the fact that\n\nthe input power was limited by the flow rates and the difficulties in ob\xc2\xad\ntaining higher current densities due to the transition from glow discharge\n\nto arc-discharge operation which prevents the attainment of further useful\n\npower for lasing.\n\nIt was further observed in our experiment that the discharge appeared\n\nto strike in an annulus between the electrodes rather than distributed\n\nover the cross section. Thus, optimum use is not made of convective\n\ncooling and the current density is not uniformly spread over the cross\n\nsection. An improved electrode, configuration and injection system should\n\npermit higher power inputs in the present experimental setup and should\n\nalso permit operation at higher pressures without transition from glow- to\n\narc-discharge yielding higher laser powers.\n\nA research program is planned to investigate the operation of molecular\n\nlasers with electrical discharges and high flow rates, at comparatively high\n\npressures (> 50 torr) and large tube diameters. Problems associated with\n\ncross-flow lasers 2 ,3 will be investigated using various techniques including\n\nmagnetic fields to prevent bowing of the discharge with the flow. Operation\n\nof glow discharges with flow rates at high pressures involves new research\n\nproblems concerning the transition of the (abnormal) glow to arc discharge.\n\nDiagnostics of the distribution of electric field, particle density and\n\nelectron temperature are planned, together with transverse gain measurements\n\nto relate the distribution of lasing action to the distribution of plasma\n\nproperties in the discharge. Transverse gain measurements along the tube\n\nlength should yield information on the efficiency of multiple excitation\n\nof N 2 along the discharge (and cavity) length, and should allow a com\xc2\xad\nparison of long tube lasers and short transverse flow lasers. Fluid mixing\n\nschemes will also be studied.\n\nHigh power pulsed .operation of electrical discharges at high pressures\n\nand high flow rates will be investigated to determine the limits of current\n\ndensity and power to which the discharge laser can be extended since in\n\n\n153\n\npulsed operation, heating of the gas and filling of the lower laser level\n\ncan be kept small through the use of short pulses. 7 Diagnostics on pulsed\n\ndischarges are also planned utilizing the powerful techniques of time\n\nsampling and signal averaging.\n\nA program is also in progress to study the feasibility of excitation\n\nmechanisms other than the glow discharge for molecular and chemical lasers\n\nin cooperation with Prof. Richard Schneider from the University of Florida.\n\nAs a preliminary experiment, the effect on a conventional CO2 laser of the\n\nhigh energy products released in the reaction of H 3 with thermal neutrons\n\nwill be investigated. Experiments at higher parti cle densities than in\n\nconventional tube lasers are-ultimately planned for investigation. The\n\neffect of neutrons on HF chemical lasers using UF6 as fluoride source will\n\nalso be studied.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \t\nDeutsch, T.

A. Hassan\n\nNorth Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina\n\n27607\n\n\nThe objective of this research is to analyze CO2 laser systems in which the\n\npopulation inversion is obtained by electrical discharges. This entails solving\n\nthe governing equations for various laser parameters, such as mass flow rate,\n\nlength and diameter of the tube laser,pressure and composition. In such discharges\n\nexcitation of CO molecules to the upper laser level results mainly from energy\n\ntransfer from vitrationally excited N 2 while the lower laser lever is depopulated\n\nmainly by collisions with He.\n\nIf one assumes that molecules in different quantum states are different species,\n\nthen the governing equations are the conservation of species equations, the over\xc2\xad\nall momentum ana energy equations, and an electron energy equation. These equations,\n\ntogether with the reactions given in Eq. (5)below, will serve as the basis of our\n\nmodel. The considerations presented here are based on these equations.\n\nExamination of the conservation of species equation, which can be written as\n\nPY.\n\np+ pu\n\n+ V\n\n(pxv)\n\n=w.\n\n,\n\ni =\n\np./\n\nCl)\n\nwhere p is the density, u the mean velocity, V. and W. are the diffusion velocity\n\nand mass rate of production of species i, shows that ihere are three characteristics\n\ntimes in a steady laser system.

Examination of the rates indicates that H is active in depopulating\n\nthe lower laser level and has little effect on theeupper laser level. On the\n\nother hand H 0 is active in depopulating all laser levels. This indicates that\n\nthere is an optimum H20 concentration beyond which a loss in laser power will\n\ntake place.\n\nThe role of H in a CO laser system is discussed next. It has been sug\xc2\xad\ngested that, in addition to depopulating the lower laser level, it has a high\n\nthermal conductivity; this results in a decrease in the gas temperature and this,\n\nin turn, increases the population inversion. However, increased conductivity re\xc2\xad\nsults in an increase in the wall losses and this results in a decreased efficiency.\n\nThus, the explanation for the improved efficiency, especially in the gas-transport\n\nlasers, must lie somewhere else. It is proposed here that the improved efficiency\n\nis a result of the high electron temperature in the discharge. This can be seen\n\nfrom the electron energy equation\n\n4\n\ns es\n\n(6)\n\nJ e\'E = 3 k Ne me (Te - T) Z m\ns\n\nwhere Je is the electron current, E the electric field, T e the electron temperature,\nT the gas temperature N the electron number density, and m the particle mass,6\nthe energy-loss factor and ves is the collision frequency oF species s. The\nquantity 6 is unity for monatomic gases and large for heavy particles (about 18 for\nN2)3, thus to maintain a high electron temperature one needs to employ an inert\nmonatomic carrier gas.\n\n157\nReferences\n\n1. \tTiffany, W.

Since the recombina\xc2\xad\ntion energy in the reaction with OH is carried away by the product H, the C02\n\nmolecule formed by this process is in the ground state (both electronic and\n\nvibrational).

Saunders\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\nProduction of critical inversion densities by chemical reactions in\n\ngas lasers has assumed increasing importance in recent years. Pulsed and\n\nc.w. gas lasers using chemical inversion were operated successfully quite\n\nrecently uiiizing vibrationally excited iydigen halides formed in chemical\n\nreactions. \' \n Highest power levels were obtained in a continuous flow\n\nreactor where the vibrati6nal energy of thehydro.gen halide was used to excite\n\nthe 0001 level in CO to obtain laser emission on the OO1 + 10\xc2\xb00 and\n\n3\n\n0001 > 0220 transitions.\n\nIn our recent studies 4 we have investigated chemical inversion in CO\n2\n\nformed in low pressure CO - 02 flames at 50 - 80 torr. The radiative\n2\n\ntransitions for \n CO2 are shown in figure 1. It was known from earlier work5\n\nthat electronically or vibrationally excited CO2 can form in the reactions\nCO + 0 + CO2 (3B 2 )\nCO2 (3 B2 )\nCO2 (B 2 )\n\n-\n\n--\n\nCO2 (IB2)\n\nC02 (\'Y+)\n\n(v ,\n1\n\n2v\n\nv3 )\n\nRadiative transitions from th excited electronic level iB\ntake place\n\n2\ninto vibrational levels of the \n 9 ground state of C02. By comparison of\n\nexperimental measurements of radiative emissions corresponding to the\n11 0\n0220, 1000 + 0110 and 0001 - 0000 transitions with the theoretical\nvalues for equilibrium vibrational distribution as shown in figure 2 for the\nlatter two, it was shown that for nearly equilibrium population of the 10\xc2\xb00\nsymmetric stretching and 020 bending modes the population of the 00l assym\xc2\xad\nmetric stretching mode is substantially less than the equilibrium value.\nIn addition the data show a definite correlation between the electronic\ntransitions populating the vibrational levels and the infrared emission inten\xc2\xad\nsities for these levels. Thie preferential filling of the bending and sym\xc2\xad\nmetric stretching vibrational energy levels of CO2 may be explained by the\n\ntransition from the bent \n iB2 state to the linear T\nconfiguration. In\n\nthis transition the bending mode vibration would be pr~ferentially excited\n\nand energy readily transferred into the symmetric stretching mode by Fermi\n\nresonance coupling whereas the uncoupled assymmetric stretching mode would be\n\npopulated largely by collisional transfer.\n\nComparing these results obtained by chemical excitation on CO2 with\n\nthe results of electron impact excitation in a CO2 electric discharge laser\n\n\n162\n\n\ncavity the role of electron impact excitation as the primary process in\n\nproducing 0001 inversion becomes quite apparent. In the recent studies\n\nof Clough and Thrush 6 on the formation of vibrationally excited N2 0 in\n\nthe reaction N + N02 + N 2 0 (vl, v 2 , v 3 ) + 0 at about 0.1 torr preferential\nexcitation of the v 1 and v2 modes was observed similarly to .\nour results with\n\n\xc2\xb0\n.\t\n2\n,\nCO\nSince N2 0 is isoelectronic with CO\nand the distribution of the\n\nvibrational energy levels is very similar, ?hese results strongly support our\n\nobservations on the\n\nCO - 0 - CO2 system.\n\n\nAt this point a substantial experimental and theoretical effort is\n\nrequired to evaluate the electronic, vibrational and rotational energy trans\xc2\xad\nfer processes controlling chemical inversion. Quantum mechanical calculations\n\nare required to predict the probabilities of electronic and vibrational\n\nexcitation in a given reaction and the initial energy distribution of the\n\nspecies formed in the reaction. Using the rate parameters available for given\n\nsystems we shall attempt to relate the internal electronic, vibrational and\n\nrotational energy transfer processes in the presence of chemical reactions to\n\nthe inversion densities obtained in a laser cavity for the same system. Com\xc2\xad\nplexity of the chemical rate processes is indicated by the rate processes on\n\nCO2 inversion as shown in figure 3.\n\nThe initial effort will be concentrated on measurements of the rotational\n\nand vibrational distributions of the laser emission radiation in halogen-halide\n\nand other chemical lasers in pulsed and c.w. operation using high flow rates as\n\na function of the reaction kinetics. The theoretical studies will be concen\xc2\xad\ntrated on solution of the radiation coupled chemical kinetic rate equations\n\nwith detailed description of the fluid dynamic and chemical rate processes.\n\nMechanisms leading to higher inversion densities and total radiated power will\n\nbe examined both experimentally and theoretically.\n\nReferences\n\n1. \tCorneil, Paul H.; and Pimentel, George C.: Hydrogen-Chlorine Explosion\n\nLaser.

H.\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\nInvestigations are under way to learn more about the plasma in a\n\nplasma-focus apparatus. This is a relatively newly-discovered method\n\nof producing extremely hot and very dense plasmas, of the order of 50\n\nmillion degrees Kelvin, 1019 particles per cubic centimeter, and a\n\nmillion atmospheres pressure. The method is of much interest in the\n\nscientific ,community and of considerable potential in several fields of\n\nboth research and practical application.\n\nSome of the results obtained to date are as follows:\n\n1. Neutron time-of-flight measurements have been successfully used to\n\nobtain the neutron energy distribution - with, however, lower resolution\n\nthan is desired but much better than that obtained by others. The statis\xc2\xad\ntics is currently being improved by using large (15") scintillators.\n\n2. Some of the distributions had a rounded peak (like a Gaussian),\n\nindicating thermalization, but some had a sharp-pointed peak, indicating\n\na beam model, or pure radial collapse.\n\n3. The width of the neutron spectrum was measured and compared with\n\npredictions of theoretical models of the plasma focus. It was found that\n\nthe half width of neutron spectra is much greater than expected from thermal\xc2\xad\nized ions at temperature of 5 keV. Therefore either the ions are not\n\nthermalized or T ?zl0 keV.\n\n4. The electron temperature was also measured with soft x-rays\n\n(bremsstrahlung) by using differential absorbers made of aluminum and\n\ncopper. The temperature was found to be in excess of 5 keV.\n\n5. Other investigators had found soft x-rays, of order 10 keV. Some\n\nhad found up to 300 keV. We were the first to report 500 keV and greater.\n\n6. The x-rays are from a point source rather than a rod-shaped or\n\nmoving lines, giving sharp pictures of x-rays penetrating more than 1 inch\n\nthick aluminum sheet, or equivalent.\n\n7. We have pinhole-camera x-ray pictures that show the shape of the\n\nplasma near the central electrode.\n\nThe big unsolved problem at the time we started this experiment and\n\nstill at the present time is whether or not the plasma is thermalized. We\n\nhave recently exposed nuclear-emulsion stacks to measure the x-ray energies\n\nor spectrum in various directions. These have been sent to Vanderbilt and\n\nBrookhaven for analysis and will be used to derive the electron velocity\n\ndistribution.\n\n*Vanderbilt University\n\n\n168\n\n\nWith nuclear emulsion, refined measurements are planned for (1)\n\nangular distribution of hard x-rays, (2) calibration of emulsions with\n\nradio isotopes and an electron accelerator, and (3) electron and proton\n\nspectra with a magnetic spectrometer.\n\nA preliminary spectroscopic investigation in the region between 500\n\nand 1400 R has been carried out. A one meter, normal incidence, vacuum\n\nspectrograph was used to record the spectra photographically.\n\nThe (time integrated) spectra in the region above 1000 R was dominated\n\nby copper line radiation (CuII,CuIII) while the spectra below 1000 X was\n\ndominated by line radiation from ionized oxygen (01II, OIV, OV, OVI).\n\nSpectra were also recorded with a center electrode cap of aluminum and\n\ncarbon. These spectra were predominated by line radiation from highly\n\nionized stages of the electrode material. Some copper lines were still\n\nobserved but were very weak indicating that some electrode material is\n\ncarried by the current sheet. The use of the different electrode materials\n\nhad no apparent effect on the production of hard x-rays.\n\nAn investigation of the radiation in the soft x-ray region is planied.\n\nSpectra of the radiation in this region will be,obtained with a bent crystal\n\nspectrograph. Line radiation in this region is due to transitions in highly\n\nionized atoms and it will be possible therefore to identify and classify\n\nthese lines. An attempt will be made to determine the shape and peak of\n\nthe bremsstrahlung continuum. The peak of this continuum radiation is a\n\nstrong function of temperature (electron) and these measurements should give\n\nsome indication of the temperature obtained in the plasma focus.\n\nAn investigation of the effects of different gases will be made and\n\nspectra of the highly ionized atoms of these gases will be recorded and\n\nclassified. Also the effects of different electrode materials will be\n\ninvestigated further.\n\n\n169\nATTENUATION OF X-RAYS FROM PLASMA FOCUS\n\nPLASMA FOCUS\n\nABSORBER\nDETECTOR 17\n\n4.0-\n\nNo absorber on both detectors\nWith Pb 1.7mm on detector H\n\n500 keV(mono)\n\n400 keV(mono)\n3.0\nDETECTOR \tI\n\n300 keV(mono)\n\nVOLTS\n2.0 \xc2\xad\n\n1.0-\t\n\nD] 3200\nD\n\nEoe\n\n0\t\n\n1.0\n\n13\n\n2.6.\n\nVOLTS\n\nkeV(mono)\n\n1i10 \t\n\n3.0\n\nkeV(thermal)\n\n4.0\n\nDETECTORJi (Reference detector\nwitnoit absorber)\n\n170\nAN INVESTIGATION OF HAED X-RAYS FROM A PLASMA FOCUS\n\nJ. H. Lee, D. S. Loebbaka, and C. E. Roos\n\nVanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee\n\nPresented at the Sixth NASA Intercenter and Contractor Conference\n\non Plasma Physics at Langley Research Center,\n\nDecember 8, 9, and 10, 1969\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA dense plasma focus produced by fast collapse of current sheets\n\nat the end of a coaxial electrode is a copious source of neutrons (from d-d\n\nor d-t reaction) and x-rays. Despite extensive studies of this device by\n\nmany workers, the mechanism of neutron and x-ray productions is not well\n\nunderstood. A few models have been proposed but none of which is\n\nThe boiler model is based on the assumption that\n\nuniversally accepted.. \n\nelectrons are thermalized in the plasma focus at a kT of a few\n\nions and\nkeV and anisotropy of the neutron yield and spectra are results of plasma\n\nCM motion. The-beam-target model considers a high current of charged\n\nparticles accelerated in an electric or magnetic field giving the production\n\nmechanism as well as the anisotropy. Accurate spectral distributions of\n\nneutrons and x-rays would distinguish between these models. With the plasma\n\nfocus apparatus at the Langley Research Center a maximum photon energy of\n\ngreater than 500 keV has been observed by means of differential absorber\n\nmethod.1 However, the determination of the spectral distribution of x-rays\n\nwas difficult since the absorption coefficients for most elements are near\n\na minimum for the energy range in consideration. This investigation is an\n\neffort to obtain the spectrum of hard x-rays from the plasma focus using\n\nelectron sensitive nuclear emulsions to clarify corresponding electron distri\xc2\xad\nbution in the plasma supplementing other diagnostics currently used to\n\ndetermine the nature of a plasma focus at the Center. \n This report covers the\n\nfirst phase of the work initiated in February, 1969.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nThe plasma focus apparatus used in this experiment is described in\n\na separate presentation of this conference. Hard x-rays are emitted simul\xc2\xad\ntaneously with neutrons at the maximum compression of the plasma. However,\n\nit is found that no correlation exists between the intensities of neutrons\n\nand x-rays, excluding the possibility of significant neutron induced gamma\xc2\xad\nray emission. To determine the adequate dose of exposures a trial set of\n\n13 emulsion (400 micron thick Ilford K-5) stacks were placed around the\n\nsource at varying distances from 15 to 90 cm. and exposed to 100 runs of\n\nplasma focus formation. The second series of experiments were carried out\n\nto determine the spectral distribution of electron tracks produced in the\n\nemulsion by either photoelectric or Compton effect of x-rays from the plasma\n\nfocus. For this run 600 micron thick Ilford emulsions obtained by a new\n\norder were used. The emulsions, stacked behind a 1.5 mm thick lead absorber,\n\nwere placed at a distance of 90 cm from the source on the axis of the\n\nelectrode. Discharges in helium were also used for comparison with the\n\ndeuterium plasma. The electron ranges were measured under a Leitz scanning\n\nmicroscope equipped with an 18 micron field of view reticle grid.\n\n\n171\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe \t istogram in Figure 1. is a result of electron range measurements\n\nh\nin 3 plates with 3807 tracks (longer than 18 microns) observed over background.\n\nThe \t anges were converted to electron energies using the relation given by\n\nr\nBarkas. 2 A few tracks extended more than 600 microns indicating electron\n\nenergies of greater than 500keV. In the figure the dotted curves represent\n\nthe \t xpected electron track distributions, arbitrarily normalized, for three\n\ne\ndifferent models of the source. The curves were obtained by taking account\n\nof the attenuation through the lead absorber and the efficiency of nuclear\n\nemulsion. A kT = 10 keV is chosen for the urve for Maxwellian electron distri\xc2\xad\nbution since it is maximum temperature one could reasonably assign for the\nplasma focus. It is clear that a Maxwellian distribution alone cannot account\nfor the high energy spectrum observed. The curve for thick target bremsstrahlung\nis drawn for an electron beam with kinetic energy of 500 keV. This model, by\nitself, cannot fit the observed spectrum. The power law curve is derived from\nthe electron distribution, f(E)Oc E-Y and the best fit value of y = h \xc2\xb1 1.\n(The spectrum of thick target bremsstrahlflng corresponds roughly to y\n0.5.)\nThe present results are in agreement with thepower law distribution reported\nfor the energy range up to 40 keV by Meskan, et al. although the accelerating\nmechanism (turbulent heating) is yet questionable.3 It is interesting to note\nthat such" distri ution of electrons is proposed for astrophysical x-ray sources,\nsuch as SCO-X-1.\nAfter determination of response function of emulsion to\nmonoenergetic gamma-rays the experimental results will be analyzed in detail\nand comparison experiment with a theta pinch will be carried out. Beside\nthe scanning of the electron tracks, the recoil protons produced by neutrons\nwere also studied. The results show that the maximum neutron energy reaches\n3 MeV, confirming the measurement made by the time-of-flight method, and\nanisotropy of neutron yields in- axial and radial direction is 1.6 \xc2\xb1 o.4, which\nis higher than the expected value (1.25) for the boiler model.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThere is a strong indication that the hard x-ray spectrum observed\n\nwith nuclear emulsions are produced by a power law distribution of electrons\n\nin the plasma focus. The detailed study of this dependence should give\n\ndecisive information on the proposed heating mechanisms in the plasma.

P. Shomo and K. H. Kim\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nThe plasma focus is produced by the discharge of a 20 kilovolt \xc2\xad\n25 kilojoule capacitor bank between the electrodes of a coaxial plasma\n\ngun filled with deuterium under yressures of a few Torr. The 1 mega\xc2\xad\nampere discharge yields up to 10\nneutrons in a burst of approximately\n\n100 nanoseconds half-width. The extremely short duration of the neutron\n\nproduction time prevents direct measurement of the neutron flux. Instead,\n\nthe decay products of a silver target activated by the neutron burst from\n\nthe plasma focus are counted. Figure 1 shows the experimental apparatus.\n\nA brief summary of the sequence of operation is: (I) A burst of 2.45 MeV\n\nneutrons is produced; (2) some of the neutrons enter the polyethylene\n\nmoderator and are thermalized; (3) the silver becog activated by the\n\nthermalized neutrgns through the two processes Ag\n(n, y) Ag\nand\n\nAg1 0 9 \n(n, y) AgllO; (4) the activated silver decays by beta and gamma\n\nemission; (5) the gammas are detected by a three by three inch Nal (TY)\n\ndetector; (6) the multichannel pulse-height analyzer provides the energy\n\nresolved gamma int nsity spectrum, and (7) the intensity of the 656 keV\n\ngamma peak of AgI I with 24 second half-life is measured.\n\nThe use of a discrete gamma peak eliminates some of the corrections\n\nand uncertainties inherent in the beta counting method. The dead-time\n\ncorrection due to the 125 microsecond characteristic dead-time of a four\xc2\xad\ngeiger-tube beta counting system can be neglected due to the 1 microsecond\n\ndead-time characteristic of Nal (TZ) detectors. The beta ounting method\n\nnondiscriminately counts betas from decaying Ag1l 0 and Agl88 having half\xc2\xad\nlives of 24 seconds and 2.3 minutes, respectively. This introduces errors\n\ndue to the uncertainties of two neutron capture cross sections, and compli\xc2\xad\ncates the calibration procedure due to the two different half-lives. The\n\ngreater penetrating power of the 656 keV gammas allows the use of a thick\n\nsilver target thereby eliminating any disadvantage suffered by the gamma\n\ncounting method due to the relative weakness of the 656 keV gamma peak.\n\nThus the use of the 656 keV gamma peak of Ag I 0 provides a significant in\xc2\xad\ncrease in accuracy over the normally used beta counting technique. Yields\n\nof 109 to 1010 neutrons per burst from the plasma focus device have been\n\nmeasured by this method with an estimated uncertainty of +16 percent, which\n\nincludes the \xc2\xb15 percent error contributed by the calibration source.\n\nThis improved method is presently being applied to neutron flux aniso\xc2\xad\ntropy measurements on the plasma focus device. It is hoped that these im\xc2\xad\nproved measurements will shed some light on the validity of either the\n\nboiler or target models of the plasma focus mechanism.\n\nNorth Carolina College, Durham, N.

Watson\n\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California\n\n\nRecent advances in computers and cathode ray tube displays\n\nhave made the computer an attractiVe tool for solving some problems\n\nin plasma dynamics. A recent investigation at Ames Research Center\n\nhas shown that the computer is particularly useful for studying the\n\ndynamics of a collisionless plasma using a computer simulation\n\ntechnique. An application of this technique is described in this\n\n.paper, and several problems that can be investigated using this\n\ntechnique are listed. The further application of the computer to\n\nprovide irisight into the dynamics of a collisional plasma is\n\ncurrently being investigated.\n\nThe computer simulation technique was used to study the plasma\n\ndynamics within a very high specific impulse accelerator. This\n\nsimulation was accomplished by representing the many ions and\n\nelectrons in the plasma by several thousand representative particles.\n\nThese several thousand representative particles were assumed to\n\nconstitute a good statistical sample of the actual ions and electrons\n\nin the plasmas. Starting with an initial distribution, the simul\xc2\xad\ntaneous motion of the representative particles was calculated as a\n\nfunction of time. First the electric and magnetic fields were\n\ncalculated from the distribution of particles; next the motion of the\n\nindividual particles during a small increment in time was calculated\n\nusing these fields with the equations of motion; and then the change\n\nin the distribution of particles caused by the motion of the particles\n\nduring the small increment of time was calculated. This procedure was\n\nrepeated for each new time increment and the field and particle\n\npositions were recorded for each time increment to provide a time\n\nhistory of the self-consistent fields and particle motion.\n\nThe motions of the particles, the electric potential, and the\n\nmagnetic field were displayed simultaneously on a cathode ray tube.\n\nThese displays, which were recorded on motion picture film, illustrated\n\nthe coupling between the particle motions and the fields. In partic\xc2\xad\nular, the displays illustrated how the plasma motion modified the\n\napplied electric potential, how the currents induced large magnetic\n\nfields, how the ions received their energy directly from the electric\n\nfield, and how the ions were deflected toward the accelerator exhaust\n\nby the induced magnetic field.\n\nThis computer simulation technique should be useful for solving a\n\nnumber of problems involving collisionless plasmas, including the\n\n\n176\n\n(1) the flow of a collisionless plasma around bodies,\n\nfollowing:\n(2) the flow of plasma within the "Mather Focus" at the end of the\n\ncathode of a coaxial plasma gun, (3) propagation of waves in\n\ncollisionless plasmas--particularly in inhomogeneous plasmas.\n\nAn investigation of the techniques for applying the computer\n\nto solve problems in collisionless plasma dynamics indicated that\n\none should not always proceed as far as possible with analytical\n\nmathematics prior to formulating the problem for the computer.\n\ncomputer simulation technique described above employs the\n\nThe \t\nequation of motion for each of the several thousand particles.\n\nInstead of solving these several thousand equations one could have\n\nsolved the Vlasov equation (which has been obtained from the\n\nparticle equations of motion by further use of analytical mathe\xc2\xad\nmatics) by a finite difference technique. Both techniques were\n\nused to solve for the voltage-current characteristics of a one\xc2\xad\ndimensional diode and the solutions were compared with experimental\n\nmeasurements of voltage and current. The computer simulation\n\ntechnique produced a much more accurate representation of the\n\nexperimental measurements than the solution of the Vlasov equation\n\nby a finite-difference technique.\n\nThe results of the computer simulation are the visual displays\n\nof the plasma motion rather than a closed form mathematical\n\nexpression for some continuous function, such as a distribution\n\nfunction. The changes in the dynamics due to changes in parameters\n\nare therefore observed visually rather than interpreted from an\n\nanalytical expression for the distribution function. In a sense,\n\nthe computer simulation is similar to a laboratory experiment where\n\none changes the parameters and observes the results. Several major\n\nadvantages of the "computer experiment" over the laboratory experi\xc2\xad\nments are (1) measurements of the plasma properties can be made\n\nwithout perturbing the plasma with probes, (2) a microscopic as well\n\nas a macroscopic picture of the plasma is obtained, and (3) the\n\nplasma temperatures are not limited by availability of power supplies\n\nor by the technology of cooling at the plasma boundaries.\n\nThe author believes there is a great potential for the "computer\nexperiment" as a tool for solving problems in plasma dynamics and\nrecommends that the computer facilities for performing these "computer\nexperiments" be expanded to be commensurate with this potential.\n\nREPORTS\n\n1. \t\nWatson, Velvin R.: "A Collisionless Model for High Specific\n\nImpulse Accelerators," AIAA 7th Electric Propulsion Conference,\n\nWilliamsburg, Virginia, March 3-5, 1969.\n\n2. \t\nWatson, Velvin R.: "Computer Simulation of a Plasma Accelerator,"\n\nStanford University Institute for Plasma Research Report No. 313,\n\nMay 1969.\n\n\n177\n\nPULSED COAXIAL PLASMA GU1N\n\nWilliam C.

P. Shomo and G. K. Oertel\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\nThe present status of our knowledge of transition probabilities or\n\nof f-values is poor compared to that of the wavelengths of atomic spectral\n\nlines. F-values are known only for a small number of the lines for which\n\nwavelengths are known, and the accuracy of the available values is usually\n\npoor. Although f-values as well as wavelengths are atomic constants\n\nobtainable in terms of integrals over wave functions, only the former involve\n\nthe overlap between two different atomic states, so that cancellations often\n\nlead to radial matrix elements which are small compared to the uncertainties\n\nof the individual atomic wave functions.\n\nThe calculation of f-values requires a knowledge of the wave functions\n\nof the two states involved in the transition. It is necessary to employ\n\napproximations to determine the wave functions for nonhydrogenic atoms or\n\nions since Schrodinger\'s equation can be solved analytically only in the\n\nsimple one-electron atom case. Several techniques that provide approximate\n\nwave functions have been developed. The most sophisticated of these tech\xc2\xad\nniques is the self-consistent-field method. The Coulomb approximation method\n\nis applicable to many lines of interest, and for those transitions where its\n\nassumptions are met, it gives f-values which are in close agreement with the\n\nself-consistent-field results. Even for relatively simple systems where the\n\ntime required for self-consistent-field calculations is still relatively\n\nshort, the Coulomb approximation method will result in a reduction of com\xc2\xad\nputing time by about three orders of magnitude.\n\nThe Coulomb approximation formalism was generalized to the multipole\nto meet the need for knowledge of forbidden electric-multipole transition\nprobabilities in astrophysics, and because large numbers of matrix elements,\nboth dipole and quadrupole, are required for computations of the Stark\nbroadening of isolated ion lines. 2 Tables for computing Coulomb approximation\nradial matrix elements were calculated\' for dipole transitions s-p, p-d, d-f,\n\nf-g, g-h, and h-i, and for quadrupole transitions p-p, d-d, f-f, g-g, h-h,\n\ni-i, s-d, p-f, d-g, f-h, g-i, and h-j. A FORTRAN IV computer program was\n\ndeveloped which takes the energy levels of a given element and stage of\n\nionization and applies the appropriate selection rules and calculates dipole\n\nand quadrupole line strengths, transition probabilities, wavelengths, and\n\ncase1\n\nNASA Headquarters, Washington, D.

Shamey\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton. Va.\n\n\nNumerical Hartree-Fock calculations are being performed to obtain\n\naccurate nonrelativistic atomic wavefunctions. As an initial approxi\xc2\xad\nmation, the Hartree-Fock-Slater (HFS) self-consistent calculations are\n\nperformed, using the well-known programs of Herman and Skillman. This\n\nprocedure does not distinguish between different terms within a configura\xc2\xad\ntion, thus resulting in only one set of energies and orbitals for a given\n\nconfiguration. These orbital energies, screening constants, and wave\xc2\xad\nfunction slopes are invaluable as input estimates for the more accurate\n\n(and sensitive) Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations, using the well-known programs\n\nof Charlotte Froese-Fischer. Because this Hartree-Fock calculation does\n\ndistinguish between the different LS terms within a configuration, each\n\nterm will be associated with its own set of orbital wave functions and\n\nenergies; for this reason, the so-called average energy is no longer the\n\nsame constant for the different term energies and thus should not be sub\xc2\xad\ntracted from the diagonal electrostatic matrix elements, as is commonly done.\n\nThese Hartree-Fock calculations are currently being applied to two\n\ntheoretical spectroscopic problems, the work still being in progress.\nThe HF results are used as the best available theoretical wavefunctions,\nfrom which all appropriate atomic parameters can be calculated.

Steinhauer and Harlow G. Ahlstrom\n\nUniversity of Washington - Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\nThe advent of high power pulsed lasers, now makes it possible to\n\nheat a dense plasma to extremely high temperatures. Short, powerful\n\nlaser pulses may heat the plasma to very high temperatures before\n\ndispersive mechanisms act to cool the plasma. One of the first questions\n\nthat must be answered is how does the plasma react during the actual\n\nheating process, i.e. during the laser pulse.\n\nUnder certain conditions of interest, some effects can be neglected:\n\nthermal conductivity, electron-ion equilibration, and plasma motion.\n\nThis case for a general, non-uniform overdense plasma has been solved\n\nusing the method of matched asymptotic expansions to obtain an analytic\n\nsolution.\n\nSolutions have been calculated for all ranges of the absorptivity.\n\nThese solutions show that the heating is either "simultaneous" when\n\nthe absorptivity is small or due to a "heating wave" when the absorptivity\n\nis large. In the "\'simultaneous" case, the entire underdense region\n\nis heated simultaneously. A hot spot is produced near the critical\n\ndensity where the laser frequency equals the plasma frequency, and much\n\nof the laser radiation is reflected and lost. In the "heating wave"\n\ncase, a heating wave propagates into the underdense region but never\n\nreaches the critical density.

One solution to the problem\n\nhas been to design the collector plates to support the peak undamped force\n\nunder static conditions (the maximum conceivable load, neglecting resonances).\n\nThe analysis and results presented here are for dynamic conditions.\n\nThe analysis treats two theoretical models: (1) the mass-spring\n\noscillator, and (2) the traveling wave model.\n\nThe mass-spring oscillator model is valid for force pulse wavelengths\n\nmuch larger than the collector plate dimensions in the direction of the force.\n\nThe mass of this model is driven by the force developed by a damped ringing\n\ncapacitor bank discharge. Mechanical damping and damping due to collector\n\nplate movement are neglected. The equation of motion is solved and the peak\n\nmovement, normalized with respect to static displacement, is plotted for\n\nvarious electrical to mechanical frequency ratios, n, and bank damping ratios,\n\n6, (fig. i). In practice, this model describes collector plate movements\n\nwhen driven by capacitor banks with frequencies not greater than several kHz.\n\nFor bank frequencies much larger than several kHz the force pulse wave\xc2\xad\nlengths are much smaller than the usual collector plate dimensions in the\n\ndirection of the force and the traveling wave model is applicable. The\n\nequation of motion for the traveling wave model is presented. The peak\n\ncollector plate stress is localized in the first force pulse wavelength and\n\nis found to be a function of the bank damping ratio only. Peak stress normal\xc2\xad\nized with respect to static stress is plotted as a function of damping ratio,\n\n6, (fig. 2).\n\nThe results of this analysis exhibit several physically understandable\n\nphenomena and can be used to design and/or estimate the strength of collector\n\nplate systems.\n\n\nIxI\n1.2:\nX d\n\nXs\n\n0\n\n0.490\n\n\nLog n\nFigure 1.\n\n-\n\nNormalized maximum movement of mass-spring model\n\n18B\n\n\n1.0\n\nl~\n\n,I if\n,I\nIi\n\n" i;\'\n\nI\n\nI\n, :l\'+\n\nJ,\n:\n: TI\n\n~\n\n1,\n\n\nli fit\n\niil\n\n;\n\nI\nII\n\n\n.\n\nit \n\n\nWI\n\nI\n\n\' III\ni\nI i\n\nlei\n1II Ii\nii:iiTiiiiiII\n\n\n. l Pi\n\n!\nI\n\ni\n\n\nI i\n\n\'\n\n.\np-ii i l : ll.\nt:it:\n. . . , , .i 1\'I\' ,i, W \'i\n\nl\n.1\n\ni\n\n\n..\n\n8\'it\n\n.1\n\n\nI\n\n\nii\n\n\nt\n\n4!

Costen\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\nA new equation has recently been derived for the motion of vorticity\n\nin a general 111D fluid, including the effects of viscosity, compressibility,\n\nnonhomogeneity, and nonconservative forces. The derivation of this equation\n\nwas made possible by introducing a kinematic modification in the derivation\n\nof Kelvin\'s circulation theorem. In Kelvin\'s derivation, one obtains a\n\nformula for\n\nIff\n do, which is the time rate of change of the flux of\n\nw-n\n\nvorticity Cd through a surface a of finite area, where a is taken to\n\nmove with the fluid. If the fluid is inviscid, subject to conservative forces\n\nonly, and if the density p is a constant or is a single valued function of\n\nthe pressure\n\np, one finds that\n\niff\nat\n\n\nt.n do = 0\n\nthese conditions vorticity moves with the fluid.\none also finds an expression for\n\nand concludes that under\nIn our modified derivation,\n\n\n-- fif m.n do, but in this case the surface\n\n\nof integration a is taken to move - not with the fluid velocity v - but\n\nwith-an arbitrary abstradt Velocity field U(x,y,z,t). The abstract velocity\n\nfield\n\n4d\n\nU\n\nis then chosen so that\n\np\n\nmJ do = 0\n without imposing any\nn-n\n\n4\n\nrestrictions on the fluid medium or the force fields. The velocity f~eld U\nrhosen may then be regarded as defining the motion of the vorticity 0, and\n\nU is found to satisfy the equation\n\n\n(t _)\n\nX W- idiv P + 2 (V-Vs\n\n-i\n\nso\n\n\n(P E + J x B) = V\n\nwhere p is the fluid density, P is the pressure tensor including viscous\n\nterms, q is the source density of distributed fluid sources, v\nis the\n\nvelocity of the source fluid, p E + J x B is the Lorentz force density, and\n\nO(x,y,z,t) is an arbitrary sca~er field. Note that U is not, in general,\n\ndetermined uniquely because of the arbitrary function\n. Physically, this\n\nmeans- that for general distributions of vortici\'ty there are arbitrarily many\n\nflux-preserving motions. But in cases where a vortex tube is isolated, the\n\ndisplacement velocity U of the tube should be uniquely determined. The\n\nfluid source density q is included in this equation since the axis of a\n\nvortex is frequently,\njconvenient place for injecting or withdrawing fluid.\n\nThe pressure tensor P -has been retained in full form to illustrate that a\n\ndisplacement velocity U may be assigned to the vorticity even in the\n\npresence of viscous diffusion.\n\nLittle progress has been made to date in solving this nonlinear equation.\n\nBut one may neglect viscosity and linearize the equation for the case of weak\n\nvorticity, weak fluid source density, and weak electromagnetic forces. This\n\ngives typically\n\n\n190\n\n\n+ q, (V\n\n+Xl\n\nwhere\n\nwl, ql\n\np1 , and\n\nJ\n\nfo V I?\n\ns\n\no\n\nare first-order perturbation fields.\n\nHere\n\n\nPo = cont. and the other zero order fluid fields satisfy the equation\n\nDv\n---\n\n+\n\nv\n\n\n+\n\nV\n\nC-4\n\n2\n-\n\n0o\n\no\n\n-Ve\n\nwhere\n\n0\n\nat2\n\nis, an arbitrary function.\n\nqo\n\nis the gravitational potential and\n\n0\n\n-\n\nThe terms of the vortex motion equation all\n\n\nhave the dimensions of force per unit volume.\n\nThe first term\n\np (U-V ) x\n\nI\n\nis\n\nrepresents the Magnus force density oi vortex filaments which do not move\n\nwith the unperturbed flow velocity\n\nvo \n\n0\n\ns\n\nt1\n\xc2\xad\n\nrepresents the force density required to accelerate the source fluid from\n\nthe source velocity\n\nv\n\nto the flow velocity\n\nv\n\na\n\n.\n\nThe third term\n\n-\n\n-\n\nPO\n\nVP\n\n0\n\n\na "bouyancy" force which acts upon density variations in the presence of the\n\nunperturbed pressure gradient. The equation states that the vorticity moves\n\nin such a manner that the Magnus force, source force, bouyant force, and\n\nelectromagnetic force densities balance.\n\nFor application of this equation to an isolated vortex tube, it is con\xc2\xad\nvenient to integrate it over the cross-sectional area of the tube, This gives\n\nPc\n\n- vo\n\nx\n\n1 \xc2\xb1><vO - v s>Q 1\n+\n\n<VP >\n\np\nM1\n\n1\nII X<B > = 0\n\nwhere r\nis the circulation of the vortex tube, Q\nis the mass of source\nfluid being added to the vortex tube per unit lengtn, M\nis the excess mass\npresent in the tube per unit length, and I\nis the tolal axial electric\ncurrent in the tube. Brackets <> denote mean values over the cross section\nof the tube. The source term, the bouyancy term, and the electromagnetic\nterm each make the motion of the vortex tube deviate in some manner from the\nzero order fluid velocity v . The effect of the I x <B > term on vortex\nmotin i wel\nmotion is well \'kown an our comments will be restricte\n ?o the other terms.\n\nknown, and\nresrcted\nOne application of the source term is to the effect of the fluid boundary\n\nlayer at a wall on the motion of a vortex whose axis intersects the wall. If\n\nfluid is sucked up from the boundary layer into the vortex as it moves (which\n\nwill occur if the vortex is sufficiently strong to have a low4 pressure core)\n\nthe boundary layer constitutes a fluid source with velocity v = 0. The\n\netfect, as seen from solving the equation for this case, is toScause the\n\nvortex to move to the right of the direction of the unperturbed flow v0 .\n\n\n191\n\n\nThe bouyancy term applies to vortices which have a low density core. All\n\nvortices in a compressible fluid which have flow velocities approaching\n\nthe speed of sound are naturally bouyant. Weaker vortices as well as\n\nvortices in an incompressible fluid may be made bouyant by injecting a\n\nlower density fluid into the core. The less dense fluid remains in the\n\ncore of the vortex provided the radial pressure gradient in the vortex\n\nexceeds the other pressure gradients in the flow. One effect of bouyancy\n\non a vortex whose axis lies in a horizontal plane is to cause the vortex\n\nto move laterally in the plane under the action of the downward pressure\n\ngradient due to gravity. This should cause the trailing vortices from the\n\nwing of an airplane, if made bouyant, to approach each other. Another effect\n\nof bouyancy is to cause two parallel vortices in near proximity to exert an\n\nattractive force on each other. This attractive force arises because each\n\nlow density core is in the radial pressure gradient field of the other vortex.\n\nThis effect on vortices of like sense, which are revolving about each other,\n\nis to reduce their revolution rate. The effect on vortices of opposite\n\nsense and equal strength, which are drifting at constant separation, is to\n\nincrease their drift velocity. The maximum changes in drift speed and\n\nrevolution rate of vortex pairs due to bouyant attraction is on the order\n\nof 10%. Larger effects result from the downward pressure gradient caused\n\nby gravity.\n\n\n192\n\n\nLOW-ENERGY ION ATOM EXCITATION\n\nR. Novick\n\nColumbia Astrophysics Laboratory\n\nColumbia University\n\nNew York, New York 10027\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\nExperimental and theoretical studies have been made of the excitation\n\ncross sections of various neutral excited states of He in low-energy He+ - He\n\ncollisions. Two striking results of the experimental observations are the\n\nlarge value of the cross section at low energies with thresholds slightly above\n\nthe final state energies, and the strong oscillatory dependence of the cross\n\nsections on projectile energy. These phenomena can be interpreted in terms\n\nof the molecular-potential energy curves of the Het system. To understand\n\nthe low-energy excitation it is noted that, in the diabatic approximation,\n\nthe gerade ground term is repulsive and pseudocrosses all of the excited\n\nstate terms. 2 . These pseudocrossings occur at a value of internuclear separa\xc2\xad\ntion, RI, of about I a.u. In the course of collisions with small enough\n\nimpact parameters, the internuclear separation decreases and passes through\n\nRI . As the system passes through the pseudocrossing, excitation occurs by the\n\nmechanism discussed by Landau, Zener, and Stuckelberg.3 This accounts for the\n\nlarge cross section at low energies. Since the thresholds occur slightly above\n\nthe final state energies, they provide a direct measure of the energy location\n\nof the pseudocrossing.4 Previously it was proposed that the oscillations were\n\nproduced by an interference effect which arose from the double passage of the\n\nsystem through the crossing at R I . However, it has now been shown5 that any\n\nphase difference thus developed is strongly dependent on the impact parameter\n\nb; consequently, the integration over impact parameters required to obtain\n\ntotal cross sections averages out this interference effect. Such a phase\n\ndifference might contribute to the oscillations reported in differential\n\ninelastic cross sections 6 but cannot explain the structure observed in the\n\ntotal cross-section data.\n\nIn a recent paper, Rosenthal and Foley show that in addition to the\ncrossing between the ground state and excited state curves at Rl, other\ncrossings between two or more excited states exist at relatively large values\nof internuclear separation, R o - 20a.u. In this model the excitation mechanism\nis essentially identical with that previously considered and hence the large\ncross sections at low energies, and the threshold energies, are explained as\nbefore. However, the oscillations are now considered to arise when two excited\nstates populated at RI develop a phase difference between R I and R before\nmixing again at R . Since the resulting phase difference is weakly "b"-dependent,\nit manifests itself in the form of oscillatory structure in the total cross\nsection. Rosenthal and Foley show that their model correctly predjcts the\noscillatory structure in the excitation functions of the 33 S and 3 S states,\nand, moreover, they ?redict that these oscillations should be in antiphase as\nis in fact observed.\nThis work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space\n\nAdministration under Grant NGR 33-008-009.\n\n\n193\n\nNew experimental studies have been made of the 2P excitation functions\n\nand of the velocity dependence of the cross sections. The latter studies were\n\naccomplished by using He 3 and He 4 in various combinations. These new data\n\nprovide \t trong additional support for the theory of Rosenthal and Foley.\n\ns\nThe results presented here have stimulated considerable efforts to\n\nunderstand the detailed interactions occurring in low-energy ion-atom collisions.\n\nThe theory recently developed by Rosenthal and Foley has been remarkably\n\nsuccessful in leading to an understanding of those results. Some unanswered\n\nquestions remain, however, and further theoretical efforts will be needed to\n\nanswer them. It is clear that the full elucidation of the detailed structure\n\nof the excitation functions will provide a powerful test of our understanding\n\nof the dynamics of the unbound molecular state formed during these inelastic\n\nconditions.\n\n1. \tS.

Sandri\n\nAeronautical Research Associates of Princeton, Inc.\n\n50 Washington Road, Princeton, New Jersey 08540\n\n\nPlasma turbulence and gasdynamic turbulence are analogous\n\nbut differ in many respects. The major interaction among\n\nplasma particles is the electrostatic Coulomb force which is\n\n1.\n\nanalogous to the intermolecular force in a neutral gas but\n\nhas an infinite range. As a consequence, plasmas behave,\n\nunder some conditions, like neutral gases but are much more\n\nunstable.\n\n2. It has been possible to develop a satisfactory theoretical\n\ndescription for dilute neutral gases which starts with the\n\nequations of motion of each of the particles in the presence\n\nof the forces exerted by all the others (Liouville equation)\n\nand leads through systematic expansions, first to a micro\xc2\xad\nscopic description (kinetic equation) and then to a macro\xc2\xad\nscopic description (fluid equations).\n\nFluid-dynamic turbu\xc2\xad\n\nlence is described by macroscopic equations. A parallel\ntheory is available for plasmas in weak magnetic fields if\nThis class of plasmas can be described\nby a well established kinetic equation which simplifies, for\nmost practical instances of stable plasmas, (E = dielectric\nthey are microstable.\n\nfunction\n\n-\n\n1) to the Landau-Fokker-Planck equation.\n\nOn the\n\nbasis of this equation, Spitzer and co-workers have calculated\nthe transport properties of stable plasmas, in satisfactory\n\nagreement with the available observations. Furthermore, from\n\nthe kinetic equation for stable plasmas, one can deduce the\n\nmagnetohydrodyn-amic equations and, in principle, describe\n\nMHD macroturbulence.\n\nA complication in the description of plasmas arises from\n\nthe fact that strong magnetic fields are often encountered\n\n\n3.\n\nin plasmas of interest.\n\nFor "collisionless" plasmas subject\n\n\n198\n\n\nto strong magnetic fields, a theory has been developed (the\'Chew\xc2\xad\nLow-Goldberger theory) which is based on an expansion in powers of\n\na parameter proportional to the Larmour radius. This theory shows\n\na remarkable feature in contrast to the description that applies\n\nto neutral gases; namely, the kinetic and fluid descriptions can\xc2\xad\nnot.be sharply separated. A further complication in describing\n\nplasmas is due to the fact that the condition of stability\n\n(c / 0) is seldom met in plasma work. For a collisionless system,\nlinear microinstabilities have been investigated extensively and\n\nwhat is believed to be a fairly complete classification is now\n\navailable (in fact, a beginning of nonlinear instability theory\n\nexists). The theory of MHD macroturbulence has not been developed\n\nto a great extent, largely because of the belief that micro\xc2\xad\ninstabilities are so damaging as to require the most immediate\n\nattention.\n\nA standard approach to the problem of microturbulence\n\n\nis the "quasilinear" theory, which is designed for collisionless\n\nplasmas. We outline, below, a program for investigating micro\xc2\xad\nturbulence in plasmas when collisions cannot be neglected.\n\n4. The first part of our program consists in investigating the\n\nbehavior of turbulent magnetized plasmas by a method which is\n\nquite different from the quasilinear theory. Our approach\n\nconsists in determining first the velocity distribution of\n\ncharged particles in the presence of random electric and magnetic\n\nfields, and making then the velocity distribution function con\xc2\xad\nsistent with Maxwell\'s equations. To present, our work has been\n\nmainly concerned with the first phase of this approach. We find\n\nthat it is possible to derive a kinetic description for particles\n\nsubject to random magnetic fields from the Liouville equation for\n\nthe entire system.\n\nThe kinetic equation is satisfied by the\n\n\nensemble average of the velocity distribution function of the\n\nparticles. This equation can be shown to reduce to a Fokker-\n\nPlanck equation if the magnetic field fluctuations are not very\n\nstrong and the kinetic energy of the particles is large. This\n\nimplies that the Fokker-Planck equation for magnetic Brownian\n\nmotion is limited to situations that correspond to\n\n\n199\n\n\naverage fields which are not very strong.\n\nWhen the mean field is\n\n\nvery strong, or, alternatively, the kinetic energy of the particles\n\nis small, a considerably more complex description of the system\n\nthan that afforded by the Fokker-Planck equation is needed.\n\nWe\n\n\nhave not completed a derivation of a suitable equation in this\n\ncase. We find, however, that it is possible to describe a number\n\nof situations in terms of equations representing both the pre\xc2\xad\ncession of the velocity vectors about the mean field and the\n\n"decay" of the distribution due to the interaction with the turb\xc2\xad\nulent magnetic field. The precession frequency and the decay\n\ncoefficient are somewhat complicated functions of the autocorre\xc2\xad\nlation of the magnetic field fluctuation.\n\nIn general, the decay\n\n\ncoefficient is negative, thus making the system unstable.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of turbulence makes the system of\n\ncharged particles exhibit paramagnetic or diamagnetic behavior,\n\ndepending on the structure of the autocorrelation function.\n\nThe\n\n\neffect is exhibited by the shift in the precession frequency\n\ninduced by the turbulence.\n\n5.\n\nThe second part of our program aims at developing a kinetic\n\n\ntheory for unstable, spatially homogeneous plasmas.\n\nFor\n\n\nexample, a plasma with the "loss cone" instability is envisaged.\n\nThe techniques that we use stem from our analysis of stable\n\nplasmas. In this case, the two-particle velocity distribution\n\nfunction, as obtained by standard methods (adiabatic theory),\n\nhas an infinite spatial range when the relative velocity vector\n\nis nearly parallel to the relative separation vector. We can\n\nshow, however, that the two-particle correlation function has\n\na finite spatial range if the effect of the decay of the velo\xc2\xad\ncity distribution is properly taken into account. The method\n\nthat has allowed us to develop a satisfactory two-particle corre\xc2\xad\nlation for stable plasmas is a local study of the phase space in\n\nthe region where the adiabatic theory yields an infinite range.\n\n\n200\n\n\nThe loss cone instability is analyzed with the same method, i.e.,\n\nin the vicinity of e = 0 where the two-particle correlation\n\nfunction diverges.\n\nThe resulting two-particle distribution\n\n\nfunction will then be utilized to determine the evolution in\n\ntime of the velocity distribution function which is initially\n\nunstable.\n\n\n6.\n\nWe discuss the results available on the unstable homogeneous\nplasmas, as well as the work in progress on understanding the\nbehavior of plasmas in the presence of fluctuating magnetic\nfields.\n\nWe also outline methods for extending our approach\n\nto electrostatic fluctuations and for making the velocity\ndistribution function consistent with Maxwell\'s equations.\n\n201\n\nHIGHER APPROXIMATIONS TO PLASMA TRANSPORT PROPERTIES\n\nW.

Both methods\n\nare questionable when first-order perturbation limits are exceeded - e.g.,\n\nwhen electron diffusion velocities are sufficiently large to invalidate\n\nlinear flux-force relations. In addition, since the Grad approximation is\n\nspecifically an expansion in the eigenfunctions of Boltzmann\'s binary elastic\n\ncollision operator for Maxwellian molecules, the reliability of that method\n\nmust-be checked for more extreme potentials even to first order. Hence an\n\ninvestigation of the limitations of these techniques is imperative for a\n\ncritical evaluation of much of the current literature.\n\nThe method employed in the present research for determining these limi\xc2\xad\ntations involves the use of an approximate kinetic equation which is solved\n\nexactly and to which the Chapman-Enskog and Grad approximations can also be\n\napplied. Comparisons between the calculated results for various transport\n\nand other plasma properties thus provide valuable insight into the desired\n\naccuracies. The essential features are summarized in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirst-order (i.e., nearly equilibrium) plasmas are found to be described\n\nquite accurately by the corresponding Chapman-Enskog theory, but not as reliably\n\nin some aspects by the 13zmoment approximation. While the latter method predicts\n\nthe diagonal transport coefficients of electrical and thermal conductivity to\n\nwithin one or two percent, errors on the order of 30 percent exist for such\n\noff-diagonal coefficients as thermal diffusion when the interaction potentials\n\nare very soft or very hard. Similar errors occur in the entropy density, the\n\ncollisional production rate of entropy, and second-order contributions to the\n\nelectron pressure tensor, all of which are corrected to nearly the exact re\xc2\xad\nsults by the addition of a few higher moments. Third-order contributions to\n\nthe electron current density and the phase angles by which the current density\n\nand the heat flux lag an applied oscillating electric field are poorly predicted\n\nby-the 13-moment approximation, the errors in these cases corresponding to\n\nfactors up to four in the limits of hard and soft particles.\n\nAll of the aforementioned errors ate explained by the inadequate descrip\xc2\xad\ntion of certain collision integrals when the 13-moment approximation is used\n\nto close out the macroscopic equations of change. However, a new phenomenon\n\nappears when a steady-state plasma becomes spatially inhomogeneous through\n\nsecond order by means of an applied electric field inducing transverse pressure\n\nand temperature gradients. The prediction of such gradients by the 13-moment\n\napproximations is extremely poor (even for Maxwellian molecules) because of\n\nthe neglect of a new and important driving force for heat transfer which\n\nappears with the addition of the next nine moments. A similar phenomenon\n\noccurs in the viscous flow of neutral gases through circular pipes and pre\xc2\xad\nsents a somewhat different description of heat transfer from the picture of\n\nNavier and Stokes and the perturbation expansion of Chapman and Enskog.\n\n\n202\n\nThe following publications have been generated by this research:\n\n(1) A Semiempirical Collision Model for Plasmas.\n\nNASA TR R-310, 1969.\n\n\n(2) A Critical Analysis of the Grad Approximation for Closing Out the\n\nMagnetohydrodynamic Equations for Plasmas.

Costen\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\nProgress has been made in the application of generalized functions to\n\nobtain transition layer solutions of the Vlasov equations (Maxwell\'s\n\nequations and the collisionless Boltzmann equation with electromagnetic\n\nforces). The objective is to find analytic solutions for the fine structure\n\nof layers of rapid transition in a two-component plasma with an applied\n\nmagnetic field for possible application to the magnetopause. It is hoped\n\nthat this may also lead to solutions for the structure of collisionless shocks.\n\nLayers of rapid transition are well suited for mathematical description\n\nby the use of generalized functions. For example, consider the representation\nF(Z, ,t) H (x) for a distribution function, where F is an analytic function\nof position\n\nr , velocity\n\nw, and time\n\nt, and Hn (x) is the Heaviside unit\n\nstep function defined, for example, by the sequence\n\n1\n\nnl\n+2n\nH (x) = 1 (l +tanh nx)\nwhere\n\nn is the sequence index. This representation\n\nF(rwt)H (x)\n\n\nengenders a rapid variation in the distribution function near the plane\n\nx = 0\n\n\n(plasma-vacuum interface) and slow variations elsewhere. The sequence index\n\nn governs the thickness of the transition layer; as n-,co the thickness of\n\nthe transition layer goes to zero.\n\nA formal method has been developed for finding solutions of the Vlasov\n\nequations where the distribution functions and electromagnetic fields are\n\nall generalized functions. The hyperbolic tangent representation of the step\n\nfunction (given above) is adhered to throughout because its derivatives have\n\nthe convenient form\n\nS (x) = 2n (H(x)\n=4n2\n\n8n(\n\n(H1(x)-\n\n2\nHn x)\n\n\n3H2 (x) + 2Hn3(X)\n\n\nwhere Sn(x) is the Dirac delta function sequence.\nthe Boltzmann equation\n\n\n+\n\nr\n\n.\n\nm\n\nThe acceleration term in\n\n\n\xc2\xb1Fw\n\nis nonlinear. Therefore the generalized function formalism used must embra&e\n\nproducts. This is a departure from the usual generalized function theory,\n\nwhere products are not defined except in a convolution sense. The extension\n\n\n2o\n\n\nto products is a simple one for the family oX generalized functions treated\nabove, for any product takes the form of a power of n multipolied by some\npolynomial in H (x).\n(The consideration of whether such products are\nintegrable in the limit n -oo\nis not relevant in the physics of transition\nlayers, because n, which governs the width of the transition layer, always\nremains finite.) Thus a class of generalized functions is defined which\nincludes products of the members of the class. The basic element of the class\nis n H1{(x), where the power 0( is an integer and the power & is a\nn\nnon-negative integer.\n\nWe seek solutions of the Vlasov equations from this class of generalized\n\nfunctions; that is, each field in the Vlasov equations is taken to have either\n\nthe form\n\n\nA\n\n(tt),,5\n2\nn\n\nG\n2Z\n\n=-A 3=O0\n\n\nU\n( t) n"\' 130\nn(\n\n\nor the form\n\nA\nn\n\n0o\n\n-A 3 =0\n\nn\n\nwhere the coefficients Bd and Fv\nare analytic functions. The infinite\n\nsummation over A is assumed to be uniformly convergent and allows the shape\nof the field in the transition layer to vary as any analytic function of\nHn(x). Negative powers of n are included because they can become signifi\xc2\xad\ncant when multiplied by positive powers of n in the nonlinear term of the\n\nBoltzmann equation. By substituting series of this type for each of the\n\nfields in the Vlasov equations and applying an identity theorem for general\xc2\xad\nized functions, one obtains a set of equations for the series coefficients.\n\nAny analytic solution of this derived set of equations constitutes a\n\ntransition layer solution of the original Vlasov equations.\n\nA method which has proven to be successful in obtaining solutions of the\n\nderived set of equations is as follows: Pick a priori the highest allowable\n\norder (power of n) for each of the fields. The equation corresponding\n\nthereto, which is the highest order equation, will normally have the applied\n\nmagnetic field (which is known) as one of the factors in the acceleration term\n\nof the Boltzmann equation. Thus the highest order equation is linear and can\n\neasily be solved for simple cases. One then proceeds to the equation corres\xc2\xad\nponding to the next lower power of n. In the nonlinear term of this equation\n\none of the factors is already known from solution of the previous higher\n\norder equation; hence this equation is linear also and amenable to solution\n\nin simple cases. By continuing to work downward in this fashion through\n\nequations of decreasing order one obtains asymtotic solutions in the expansion\n\nparameter n-1 for each of the fields. The accuracy of these solutions\n\nincreases as the transition layer becomes thinner (n increases).\n\n\n205\nRESEARCH ON THE LOW DENSITY HOLLOW CATHODE\n\nGuiseppe Palumbo, Paul J. Wilbur, and William R. Mickelsen\n\nColorado State University, Ft. Collins, Colo.\n\n\nA mercury vapor hollow cathode discharge is being investigated\n\nfor application to electron bombardment thrusters. The hollow\n\ncathode is located at one end on the axis of an annular pole piece\n\nwhich carries magnetic flux to the main discharge of the thrusters.\n\nIn conventional designs there is no magnetic field inside the pole\n\npiece. Preliminary experiments reported here indicate that substan\xc2\xad\ntial reduction in discharge power consumption can be attained by\n\naddition of a magnetic field internal to the cathode jple piece.\n\nPossible reasons for these results are discussed.\n\n\n2o6\n\nCONSTRICTED ARC PLASMA JETS\n\nCharles E. Shepard\n\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California\n\n\nExisting constricted-arc supersonic plasma jets produce streams\nof very high enthalpy at relatively low densitY 2 in a variety of\ngases. Performance data for air and nitrogen \' show that enthalpies\ncorresponding to superorbital velocity can be produced at densities\n\ncorresponding to flight at altitudes down to about 60 km. Although\n\nexisting constricted-arc jet facilities have proved very useful at\n\nAmes, there is a clear need for higher operating pressure in order\n\nto produce higher Reynolds numbers and to simulate flight at lower\n\naltitudes..\n\nWhen the pressure is increased beyond the normal operating\n\nlevel, two related problems become apparent. The constrictor disks\n\nthat make up the arc tube can fail either due to inadequate water\n\ncooling or to electrical breakdown (arc-over) between adjacent\n\nconstrictor disks. For the same total constrictor length, thinner\n\ndisks reduce arc-over tendencies but are more difficult to cool.\n\nThe performance of thinner, better cooled constrictor disks similar\n\nto those developed by Maecker has been studied both by means of\n\ncomputer calculations and by experiment. The results of the studies\n\nindicate that the maximum constrictor wall heat transfer rate can be\n\nincreased from the present value of 3 kW/cm 2 to about 10 kW/cm 2 .\n\nAlthough water cooling is necessary for steady-state operation,\n\nheat capacity cooling offers some important advantages for short time\n\noperation. Not only are the parts cheaper and easier to make and\n\nmodify, but also higher heat transfer rates can be maintained for\n\npulsed operation than for steady-state water cooling, as shown in\n\nFigure 1. Two schemes for short time runs are being investigated.\n\nMillisecond operation from a LC lumped parameter discharge line has\n\nalready been shown to be feasible in a contract study by General\n\nDynamics/Convair for Ames. Power levels of hundreds of megawatts for\n\nseveral milliseconds appear practical with about 106 joule energy\n\nstorage. Alternately, lower resistance inductors now being sought\n\nshould permit test times of tens of milliseconds at many tens of\n\nmegawatts power.\n\nShort time operation of a heat capacity cooled arc jet from a\n\nconventional DC power supply may also be advantageous. Economy in\n\nconstruction and power supply costs for heat capacity cooling were\n\nimportant factors for a new 6 cm internal diameter constricted-arc\n\njet. This device is a prototype of a steady-state constricted arc\n\njet that will provide high radiative heat transfer rates to blunt\n\n\n207\n\n\ntest bodies. The device consists of a 6 cm I.D. x 2.4 meter long\n\nconstrictor tube followed by a divergent nozzle having an exit\n\ninch diameter tungsten rods form\n\ndiameter of 10 cm. Thirty-six\na heat capacity cooled multiple cathode at the upstream end of the\n\nconstrictor tube. Ninety 3 inch diameter rods make up the multiple\n\nanode that is located along the nozzle surface. The design goals\n\nare a total enthalpy of 116 MJ/kg and an impact pressure of 1.0 atm.\n\nPreliminary tests of the 6 cm diameter, heat capacity cooled\n\nconstricted-arc jet at power levels up to 14 megawatts have produced\n\ntotal enthalpies in excess of 120 megajoules/kg and a test body\n\nimpact pressure of about 0.4 atm. These tests indicate that useful\n\nheat transfer data can be obtained in the .2 to .5 second test\n\nintervals.

Stewart, NASA Langley Research Center\nDuring the past several years we have carried out experimental and theoretical\nstudies of the flow behavior in an arc heater employing an electromagnetically\ndriven confined vortex. These efforts have been directed toward the develop\xc2\xad\nment of a device that will produce high Reynolds number nozzle flows with\ngas velocities that approach reentry flight speeds. Several small (500 kw)\n\narc driven devices have been operated extensively to determine the variation\nof performance and the ability to predict performance for different operating\nEarly experiments are reported in\nconditions and heater configurations.\nreference 1 and a more recent range of performance is shown in figure I along\nAt the high mass flow rate (10 gms/sec)\nwith a schematic diagram of the device.\nof the arc input power appears as net energy addition to\nnearly 60 percent\nAt the low mass flow rates\nthe gas (thermal plus directed kinetic energy).\nTest results indicate that the overall\nthe efficiency is 48 percent.\nThis implies\nperformance rises significantly as the Hall parameter increases.\nthat substantial gains in performance can be obtained by operating at high\nmagnetic field strengths. This is a unique advantage of these devices.\nThe theoretical studies have been reported in reference 2. Closed form\nsolutions for the azimuthal velocity, induced magnetic field and pressure\n\ndistribution within the vortex have been obtained from the coupled set of\nelectromagnetic and fluid dynamic equations within the MHD approximation.\nNumerical solutions to the non-linear energy equation have been obtained\nusing a fifth degree polynomial for the variation of electrical conductivity\nSolutions to the energy equation provide the temperature\nwith temperature\ndistribution, Mach number distribution, and power required to heat and\naccelerate the vortex. Experimental measurements of pressure, velocity\ndistributions inside the vortex chamber, and the power required confirmed\nThe experimental and theoretical studies\nthe theoretical predictions.\nhave been applied to design and build a larger device with twice the are\nThis device\n(% = 4 webers/meter 2 ).\ngap and magnetic field strength,\nwill soon be tested. In addition, the Structures Research Division, at\nLangley Research Center, is constructing a third and larger device and\nthe Australian National University at Canberra is also contemplating the\nconstruction of similar type of arc heater with an accelerating vortex.\n\nThe ultimate performance of these devices is not known at present, however,\nexperimental studies with these new devices will define new performance\n\nlevels and furnish scaling data.\n\nFigure 2 lists typical performance.\n\nIn addition to the vortex studies we have carried out experiments with a\ndevice that incorporates a mechanically and electrically coupled linear\naccelerator section downstream of the circular channel, figure 3. Higher\npressures and larger plasma interaction lengths are an advantage of this\nSteady state operation\ntwo-stage device over a single accelerating cycle.\n\n210\n\nof the vortex-linear device has shown a 58 percent efficiency for energy\ninput to the gas. 2 Considering the relatively low magnetic field strength\n(1.1 weIiers/meter ) this represents a considerable increase in performance\n\nover the single stage vortex device operating at the same field strength.\n\nBasic research studies applicable to both accelerators concerns the funda\xc2\xad\nmental behavior of high current arcs that are driven over cold metal surfaces\nby electromagnetic means. We have carried out an extensive series of\nexperiments on arc behavior which are reported in references 3 and 4. Of\nparticular interest is the large increase in current sheet (or diffused arc)\nrotational velocities in the spiral cathode devices ccmpared with concentric\ncircular electrode geometries. An attempt to link this behavior with the\nradial displacement effect of the highly ionized region of the arc at the\ncathode has been made in reference 5. An order of magnitude argument\nindicates that significant additional "local" Lorentz forces may be\npresent on the cathode sheath in spiral vortex geometries as compared\nwith circular geometries. Figure 4 indicates the basic geometries studied\nand shavs the results with velocity as a function of driving force for\nthese different configurations.\nThe cathode current sheet velocities\nfor the spiral cathode are more than four times higher than the velocities\nfor the circular cathode The velocities in excess of 8000 meters/second\n\n0\nare believed to be higher than any yet reported at the pressure levels\nshown.\nThe behavior of several particular rotary are devices has been studied\nboth theoretically and experimentally. The confined vortex flow that is\nheated and driven electromagnetically appears to offer higher simultaneous\nvelocity and Reynolds number performance than is presently available\n\nwith conventional arc heaters. Upcoming experiments with larger devices\nwill define the hypervelocity nozzle flow conditions that can be achieved.\n\n211\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \t Stewart, R. B. and Wallio, M.

W. Huber, J. S. Evans, and C. J. Schexnayder\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nIn order to define, circumvent, or alleviate the radio attenuation\n\nwhich occurs during spacecraft atmospheric entry one must first be able\n\nto describe the magnitude and distribution of electron concentration in\n\nthe plasma flow near the antenna, and then to determine the interaction\n\nof the em field with this plasma. In the real-life situation, many factors\n\nsuch as reaction rates, ablation, separated flow., angle of attach, antenna\n\nconfiguration, etc., combine to make the complete problem too complex to\n\nassess on a purely theoretical basis. As an alternative, one lays the\n\ngroundwork using idealized theoretical models for various facets of the\n\nproblem and then assesses the applicability of these models by comparison\n\nwith data from the laboratory, or with flight measurements when the problem\n\ncannot be properly simulated on the ground. One purpose of the Langley\n\nResearch Center project RAM program is to obtain reentry flight data which\n\ncan be interpreted in terms of models for the plasma flow, for em propagation,\n\nand for alleviation of signal attenuation. Towards this end, RAM vehicles\n\nof hemisphere-90 cone configuration have reentered the earth\'s atmosphere,\n\nat near-orbital velocity, at near-zero attitude, and with both ablating and\n\nnonablating heat shields. They were equipped with various onboard plasma\n\ndiagnostic sensors, various communication systems, and a material injec\xc2\xad\ntion scheme to modify the plasma and reduce attenuation. The vehicle\'s\n\nnose radius is 0.5 feet.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to draw conclusions relative to the re\xc2\xad\nentry plasma ionization by comparison of results from theoretical models\n\nwith the onboard diagnostic data and with the passive data obtained from\n\ninterpretation of the signal attenuation.\n\nThe theoretical models which are employed in the comparison include\n\nthe following:\n(1) Pure air inviscid and merged boundary-layer-inviscid\n\nblunt-body flow-field models in which the various air species chemical\n\nkinetics reaction rates can be treated as independent parameters, (Ref. 1);\n\n(2) pure air boundary-layer correlations in which the influence of anbi\xc2\xad\npolar electron-ion diffusion and wall recombination are exhibited;\n\n(3) boundary-layer program in which the effects of alkali ablation contami\xc2\xad\nnants on the ionization profiles are exhibited, and (4) a nonhomogeneous\n\nslab plane wave em plasma propagation model for determining signal attenua\xc2\xad\ntion due to the plasma (Ref. 2).\n\nThe flight data used in the comparison includes onboard measurements\n\nof collected current from a rake of eight Langmuir probes extending 7 cm\n\ninto the flow field at the aft part of the-vehicle, onboard reflected power\n\nmeasurements from 15 reflectomers located at four station along the body\n\n(four different frequencies), and onboard measurements of VSWR for three\n\n\n217\n\n\nof the communications antennas. Ground-based received signal strength\n\nmeasurements for different polarizations were made for the four communi\xc2\xad\ncations antennas (four different frequencies) from a number of different\n\nrange stations in radio contact with the spin stabilized reentry vehicle.\n\nThe vehicle reentered at 25,100 ft/sec and its attitude was maintained\n\nat less than three degrees during the reentry data period. RAM C-i had\n\na NARMCO ablating heat shield which contained more than 103 ppm of sodium\n\nand potassium, while RAM C-2 had a beryllium and teflon heat shield which\n\nwas free of alkali contaminants.\n\nSome of the conclusions which have resulted from the comparison of the\n\ntheoretical with the experimental data are briefly summarized below, along\n\nwith the basis upon which they are reached:\n\n1. NO\xc2\xb1 air reaction rate.- Computer experiments show that the peak\n\nprofile ionization, and the C and X-band signal attenuation for pure air\n\nare quite sensitive to the NO+ rate in the altitude range above about\n\n120 Kft. C-band signal attenuation data in this altitude range for the\n\nflight with a beryllium heat shield followed by a teflon body coating shows\n\nguod agreement with that computed using the NO- rate recently measured in a\n\nshock tunnel, reference 3, while the X-band data agreement is not as good,\n\nbut closer to this rate than the older rate of reference 4 which is slower\n\nby a factor of three. These results are shown in Fig. 1.\n\n2. Ablation ionization.- Theoretical ionization profiles and signal\n\nattenuations were computed for cases where alkali material is contained in\n\nthe boundary layer due to the NARMCO heat-shield ablation. Comparison of\n\nthe signal attenuation data for the NARMCO flight, RAM C-i, with that of\n\nthe beryllium-teflon flight, RAM C-2, and comparison of the theoretical\n\nmodel for pure air with the ablation impurity model both show a large effect\n\nof the ablation impurities. Furthermore, the air model using the fast NO+\n\nrate is in reasonably good agreement with the RAM C-2 attenuation data, while\n\nthe ablation model, although not agreeing quantitatively, shows the same\n\nqualitative trends as the RAM C-1 data below altitudes of about 180 Kft.\n\nComparison with the low altitude signal recovery data, where ablation rates\n\nare highest, is shown in figure 2. In figure 3, attenuation data from\n\nRAM C-1 at higher altitudes is compared with the ablation model to suggest\n\nthe very interesting probability that the impurity ionization disappears\n\nat about 200 Kft due to lack of ionization time. This is seen in the sudden\n\ndrop of attenuation as compared with local equilibrium theory.\n\n3. Electron-ion diffusion.- Theoretical correlations are made for the\n\nRAM high altitude regime which show that the effects on peak profile ioniza\xc2\xad\ntion due to ambipolar electron-ion diffusion and wall recombination are very\n\nlarge at altitudes much above 230 Kft. Reflectometer measurements and VSWR\n\nindications of the peak electron concentration confirm this result, while the\n\nLangmuir probe profile measurements show, in addition to this large reduction,\n\na pronounced distortion of the profile away from the wall as compared with a\n\ntheoretical model with no electron-ion diffusion.\n\n\n218\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \t\nEvans, J.

S. Evans, C. J. Schexnayder, and P. W. Huber\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nTechniques are described for the computation of electron concentra\xc2\xad\ntion profiles in the shock layer surrounding a blunt-nosed vehicle during\n\nentry into Earth\'s atmosphere at near-orbital speed and ,at altitudes where\n\nion diffusion effects can be neglected. Emphasis is on careful treatment\n\nof finite rate chemistry and boundary-layer effects. A streamtube approach\n\nis used to calculate gas composition and flow properties in both the invis\xc2\xad\ncid and viscous parts of the shock layer. Each streamtube (see fig. 1)\n\nbegins immediately behind the shock front with free-stream composition and\n\nfully excited internal energy. Simultaneous integration of flow equations\n\nand chemical kinetic equations is carried out for streamlines defined by\n\nspecified pressure distributions. The equations and their solution are\n\nmodeled after reference 1. For the body shown (sphere-cone; dN = I ft.,\n\ncone half angle = 90) the boundary layer is too thin to have an appreciable\n\neffect on Ne profiles below about 175,000 feet and nearly fills the shock\n\nlayer at 230,000 feet. Thus, increasing numbers of streamlines are\n\nswallowed by the boundary layer as altitude increases. Streamlines are\n\nfollowed into the boundary layer on the basis of a mass flow criterion,\n\nbut only gas composition is computed, since the flow properties are found\n\nfrom boundary-laygr calculations.\n\nThe species and the reactions are shown in figure 2. The atmosphere\n\nis assumed to consist of 02 (21%) and N2 (79%). All possible atoms,\n\ndiatomic molecules, and their singly charged positive ions are included,\n\nand, in addition, the negative ions 0- and 02- are also. The reactions\n\nare divided into three groups: neutral, charge production, and charge ex\xc2\xad\nchange. Since the charged species make up only a tiny fraction of the total\n\ngas, the thermodynamic properties of the mixture is for all practical pur\xc2\xad\nposes controlled by the neutral reactions. Creation and destruction of\n\ncharges takes place only through the charge production reactions. The charge\n\nexchange group is important because it provides paths for rapid buildup\n\nand/or destruction of species which would otherwise be slow to change. For\n\nexample, the rate of recombination of 0 by reaction 11 (3-body recombination)\n\nis negligible at 175,000 feet but the rate of exchange with NO to produce\n\nNO+ \n is rapid. Then NO+ combines with e-.\n\nThe importance of adequate provision for charge transfer is illustrated\n\nin figure 3, where, with no charge transfer reactions, 0+ and N+\n build\n\nup to smaller initial values than they should and then decrease not at all\n\nduring the expansion. A limited system of two charge transfer reactions,\n\nwhich connect 0+ to 02+ and N+\n to N2+, gives higher initial values\n\nbut they are still essentially frozen during the expansion. In the latter\n\ncase e- remains quite high because of the failure of the atomic ions to\n\ndisappear. The effect of calculations like the above on Ne profiles at\n\n156,000 ft, x/dN = 4, is shown in figure 4.\n\n\nare plotted against\n\nIn figure 5 the body streamline values of y\nwith local ionic equi\xc2\xad\naltitude at several body stations and are compares\nlibrium values. (For local ionic equilibrium all ion concentrations are\n\nin equilibrium with local concentrations of the neutral species at the\n\nlocal temperature.) Since local ionic equilibrium represents a lower bound,\n\nelectrons cannot recombine as completely at 100,000 feet as they can at\n\n175,000 feet. \n If the lower bound can be removed then further recombination\n\ncan take place. One way to lower the bound is by injecting water into the\n\nflow as shown okyigure. It was calculated at altitude = 131,000 feet,\n\nI (W = mass flow of water/mass flow of air) by means of another stream\xc2\xad\nW=\ntube program (ref. 2) which has been developed to study the effects of water\n\ninjection on Ne profiles during atmospheric entry. This analysis accounts\n\nfor the presence of accelerating and evaporating water droplets in the flow,\n\nas well as chemical reactions introduced by adding hydrogen.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \tLomax, Harvard, and Bailey, Harry E.: A Critical Analysis of Various\n\nNumerical Integration Methods for Computing the Flow of a Gas in\n\nChemical Nonequilibrium.
