This flow was monitored along the Norwegian coast using Geosat altimetry on two ascending arcs during the Exact Repeat Mission in 1987-1989. Concurrent undertrack CTD surveys were used to fix a reference surface for the altimeter-derived SSH anomalies, in effect creating time series of alongtrack surface dynamic height topographies. Climatologic CTD casts were then used, with empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, to derive relationships between historical surface dynamic heights and vertical temperature and salinity profiles. Applying these EOF relationships to the altimeter signals, mean transports of volume, heat, and salt were calculated at approximately 2.9 Sverdrups, 8.1 x 10 exp 11 KCal/s and 1.0 x 10 exp 8 Kg/s, respectively. Maximum transports occurred in February/March and minimum in July/August.", "title": "Transport of the Norwegian Atlantic current as determined from satellite altimetry", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T16:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920063572, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pistek, Pavel"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "fec87494ef6541d4927deb2f051f05c8"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920063572, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnson, Donald R."}, "organization": {"name": "U.S. Navy, Stennis Space Center", "location": "Bay Saint Louis, MS, United States"}}, "id": "5b10853e3e7a417080cda7db494c65f1"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920063572, "publications": [{"volume": "19", "submissionId": 19920063572, "issue": "13, J", "issn": "0094-8276", "id": "5418d71fae9a4d21ac12a1e5b22872de", "publicationName": "Geophysical Research Letters", "publicationDate": "1992-07-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
