It provides tools that help strengthen the stability, security and performance of cyber infrastructures and IT systems. NASA IV&V has created an adaptable virtual environment that is representative of a typical NASA mission system of systems environment that serves multiple purposes: Training of network defenders. Ability to perform simulated red vs blue training events. Ability to deploy mission specific technologies in a cyber contested environment. Ability to demonstrate vulnerabilities and their impact to ground and space systemsThe overall system is comprised of more than 70 virtual machines and physical infrastructure to demonstrate real-world cyber attacks against: email users, wireless networks, and physically implanted devices with command and control call-back. The cyber range was built to emulate a NASA precipitation satellite infrastructure.This presentation will give an overview of the virtual cyber range and how it was used to conduct a simulate red vs blue exercise with the goal of compromising the simulated spacecraft that utilizes real NASA flight software.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190001085, "endDate": "2019-02-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Aerospace Corp.", "location": "Los Angeles, CA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "66fa38fe29124835b786a9b15c9591fd", "id": "09b49836c7c04bee88ef72061af02e25"}], "name": "Annual Ground System Architectures Workshop (GSAW)", "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": "66fa38fe29124835b786a9b15c9591fd", "startDate": "2019-02-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190001085, "id": "239065677f6243b6aedf3f6d59eda085", "publicationDate": "2019-02-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190001085.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190001085/downloads/20190001085.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190001085/downloads/20190001085.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190001085/downloads/20190001085.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
