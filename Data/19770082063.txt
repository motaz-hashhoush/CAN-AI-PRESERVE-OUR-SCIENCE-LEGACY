The\n\ndifference between the two curves is interesting, since it indicates that bakelite is benefited more by a\n\nsix-hour pure at 250 0F than by one hour at 4000 F. The other curves represent extensive post cures of\n\ntwenty-five hours and longer. Increased strain sensitivity is demonstrated to above 5500 F. The same gage\n\ninstallations represented by curve E, when temperature cycled for the second time, or recycled, should be\n\n"flat" to about 600 0 F.\nFigure 3 shows a larger number of recommended cures for various maximum test temperatures. In most cases.\n\nthe final cure temperature should equal or exceed the maximum test temperature. After the proper time at\n\none temperature level during the curing cycle, we increase immediately to the next temperature r..\'e and\n\nhold. Figure 3 shows that two hours rather than one is usually recommended for the 400\xc2\xb0F curing temperature.\n\nThis is done because laboratory technicians often start timing the cycle before the specimen has reached the\n\ndesired temperature.\n\nThere are two problems encountered with post cure of this type:\n1.

Our laboratory tested gages represented by Curve C\n\nof Figure 2 which showed failure at about 500\xc2\xb0F for creep at 530 0F. Total creep in one hour was about 1.5\n\npercent and for five hours was about 6 percent. The longest we have been able to get a single installation\n\nto last in the oven has been ten hours, which seems inadequate when there is no sign of gage deterioration.\n\nWe know that gages can operate at 600OF for some finite period of time, probably in the order of one hundred\n\nhours. This testing has been started, and we are going to expand it for more complete results. In time we\n\nexpect to supply information on a greater variety of cures than those described. We are aso working other\n\ncombinations such as bakelite with low temperature epoxy, epoxy gages with other types of epoxy cements and\n\nEastman 910 cement used with bakelite and epoxy gages.\n\nThere are two precautions concerning this information that should be noted.\n\n1. \t\nWire gages with bakelite matrix are good to about 350OF even under rather severe treatment.\n\nIn some instances, if the gage is fairly long or if it is a flat grid of good proportions,\n\nthey can be utilized to about 400 0 F. Wrap-around bakelite gages, however, have limiting\n\ntemperatures considerably less than those mentioned previously.\n\n2. \t\nBakelite gages of the common variety are made with a polymeric reinforcing paper and soldered\nwire joints which can be considered reliable to 450 0 F. If one anticipates any elevated tem\xc2\xad\nperature strain gage work in the range of 500\xc2\xb0F or above, special gages should be ordered for\nthe purpose. Ultimately. we plan to produce only gages which will withstand 6000F.\nIf someone orders 600OF foil gages from my company, the order department consults with me concerning what\n\nis desired. These gages look identical to other foil gages, but they have leads attached by welding or\n\nwith 600\xc2\xb0F solder. One can usually cure a gage above the melting temperature of solder since the solder\n\nwill remain \t position during curing despite its molten state.\n\nin\nQuestion: \t Will the same cure cycles apply if one were to use other than a bakelite gage, i.e., a strippable\n\nfoil gage?\n\n\n3\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nIt will not work with a strippable gage and-epoxy cement because the modulus of elasticity of\n\nepoxy cement decreases rapidly at 350\xc2\xb0F to 400\xc2\xb0F regardless of the post cure. We do not under\xc2\xad\nstand why this works with bakelite, but apparently the glueline is thin enough that the shear\n\nstrength is maintained sufficiently to get good sensitivity. we constructed some gages of epoxy\n\nsimilar to the EPY-400, and they just do not perform properly at 350 0F. The curve drops right\n\noff regardless of post cure. It seems that the curve for phenolic materials also drops off at\n\nabout this temperature, but if one keeps curing them, the modulus of elasticity goes back up.\n\nWhen the temperature is raised and lowered, the line stays at a high level.\n\nThe epoxy does not\n\n\ndo this, but is more like a thermoplastic material.\n\nQuestion: \tAre you implying that EPY-400 is a phenolic, not an epoxy?\n\nAnswer: \t No, it is an epoxy.\n\nIt will not work in construction of a gage nor for putting down a strippable\n\none, but it does work as an adhesive for bakelite gages.\n\n\nQuestion: \tHow about gages with an epoxy matrix?\n\nAnswer: \t We have never been able to get these above 350OF on any kind of static testing.\n\nQuestion: \t Why not use the bakelite cement, then?\n\nAnswer: \t The only reason is because it requires pressure for polymerization, which is sometimes more dif\xc2\xad\nficult to get than one would think. Bakelite cement with pressure is actuallythe better system.\n\nWe expect that it will give as good or better results than the systems shown here, and one can\n\ncure it in considerably shorter time.\n\nIt does require .pressure, however.\n\n\nQuestion: \tWhy don\'t you make epoxy-backed-gages that are good at higher temperatures, i.e., carry EPY-400\n\nto 600OF?\n\nAnswer: \t The problem is the decreasing modulus of elasticity with temperature. We cannot find an epoxy\n\nwhich will retain its modulus above 350 0F. In fact, \'at room temperature the modulus of most\n\nepoxies is 500,000 psi, while at 4000F it is only 3,000 psi. The properties that accompany this\n\nlow modulus do not provide enough shear strength to give a good strain-sensing assembly.\n\n\nA New Stress-Strain Gape.-\n\nThe material of Appendix A fully describes this device.\n\nFigure 4 is a standard\n\n\ntransducer that has been available. The angle 6 bears a direct relation to\n\nPoisson\'s ratio for the material on which it will be installed. Figure 5 shows the new stress-strain gage.\n\nThe theory of operation is fully described with sample calculations and graphs of the error functions.\n\n-This gage is unique, since with proper switching and readout equipment, one can obtain axial stress and\nbiaxial strains from the same installation. Gage element resistances have been selected such that the major\nelement is 350 ohms and the minor element is approximately of 100 ohms, i.e., 98 ohms in one case and 115\nohms in the other. The gages have been made for material with Poisson\'s ratio of 0.33 and 0.28, and will\nbe supplied in bakelite matrix only at this time. With proper construction and proper post cure, they can\nbe used at temperatures up to 600 0 F.\nGraphs for error in calculated stress, using these gages in various combinations of specimen properties\nand stress-strain gage characteristics have been developed. These figures appear quite similar, but actually\nthey are different.\nIncluded in the text is the topic of Poisson\'s ratio with a discussion of values available and accuracies\n\nof these values. A correct method for obtaining Poisson\'s ratio of any material by experimental techniques\n\n4\n\n\nis given. A graph for the error in calculation of Poisson\'s ratio when using strain gages with various\n\ntransverse sensitivities is included. The errors for a large number of wire and foil gages are shown in\n\nthe plots so that one can make reasonable corrections if working with Poisson\'s ratio.\n\n\na\n\nElement\n\n\ndsElement 2\n\na\n\nFigure 4\n\nTypical Wire Stress-Strain Gage\n\nFigure 5 \t Typical Etched Foil\n\nStress-Strain Gage\n\n\nQuestion: \tWould these error factors and other data be satisfactory for use with a stress-strain gage of\n\nAnswer: \t\n\ndifferent size and area?\n\nAt this time we have one size only, so we do not know what effect size and shape will have.\n\nThe supposition that these figures apply is not necessarily correct. It is a matter of the\n\ntransverse sensitivity of that particular gage.\n\n\nQuestion:\nAnswer-\n\nWhat bonding do you use for this stress-strain gage?\n\nBakelite, EPY-400, or any epoxy.\n\n\nQuestion: \tIs this true for 6000 F application?\n\nAnswer: \t\nFor 6000F, one would use EPY-400.\nNAS 942 Qualification Testing.\n\nThis last item, which has considerable interest, concerns specimens that\n\nFrank Hines has designed and worked on for the NAS 942 testing. Figure 6,\n\nB-L-H Drawing 206701-1, is a channel specimen designed for tension and compression tests at temperatures up\n\nto and above 1000 0F. Figure 7, B-L-H Drawing 206683-1, is a sheet specimen intended for determination of\n\ncreep, zero drift and mechanical hysteresis at temperatures up to approximately 6O0 F. This specimen can\n\nbe changed \t\nquickly and has low thermal lag which permits rapid temperature variations.\n\nThe reasoning behind the design of the channel specimen involved a desire to conduct evaluation tests of\n\nstrain gages mounted on the centroidal axis of the test specimen. This reduces bending effects on the gage\n\nto a minimum. The average strain at the oentroidal axis is not a function of the amount of bending; there\xc2\xad\nfore, strain calibrations are more accurate and more applicable to data taken on gages on the same specimen.\n\n5\n\n\nAU NPOUN) 1o\n\n-hYD0AT\n\n40\n\n&TI4\n-===:--N-b-\n\n2- \'---.\n\nk\n\n=\n\n-\n\n-...\n\n......\n\n-\n\npy\n\no=.ono\nUIVXSOf4ZfI\n\nChannel type universal strain\n\nsecien\ngageevauaton\n\no\n\'o+.. r\n\n__/.onif.\n\nshestcfo\n\nevaluation\n\n*\n\n_44\xc2\xad\n\nC~4\n\nNO\n\nFigure\n\n6\n\nfS\n\nXASACNUS\n\novo\n\nVt.\n-o"\n\nt\n\ns+w-"co....ESSMM--\n\nMATERIAL\n\nAR? .CO\n\n"-\xc2\xad\n\nStrain gage test specimen from\ncreep, zero drift and mechanical\n\nhighsteper\n\n\nELCELEASEDISRUETAIN\n\nIISO\n\n77\'S7\n\n\n\'.D\n\n-\n\nBALDWIN-LIMA-HAMILTON CORP.\n\nr\n/O8o\nlIVISION\n\nEECRONICS AN[D INSTSWIENTATION\n\n=1/St-\n\nA\n\nSE\n\nZ\n\n70\n\n\nNOTE\nESS =.oTHERWISEo+=\n\nFRACT Tot\n\nj\n\n-\n\n...\n\nnfof\n\nTHJCKN\n\n70--3S0ALE\n\n.....\n.oS\n\nIIVOI~f\n\n,Pc&3-\'\n\nWALTHAM 54\nrl\n\nM\n\nor\n\nFZOG1O\n\nr\n\nDW\n\nBALDWIN-LIMA-HAMILTON CORP.\n\n00/\n\n.12\n\nI2\n\n-\n\nO;;W:-\n\nn\n\n22\'0...\nSti.2~!k 4nt\nANGLA\n\nFigure 6\n\nTLC ro\n\nL....\n\nIII\n\nSCL\n\n____________________\n\n4 J5\nFigure 8\n\nFigure 9\n\nuniversal channel assembly using\nCompression test specimen.\n\n3-\n\nO-2\nff\n\n* --\n\nTension test assembly using\nuniversal channel specimen.\n\n..\n\nX\n\n-\n\nI\n\n,,\n\n71\n.\n\nTension test assembly\n\non-1\n\n\xc2\xad\n\n?

The specimens and their jigs have\n\nbeen thoroughly evaluated.\n\nThe evaluation was begun with the channel specimen by clamping it at one end in two mutually perpendicular\ndirections for two different tests as a cantilever beam. The strain on the flange of the beam was over\none thousand microstrains while the indicated strain on the gaging area was less than eight microstrains\nin all cases. This is considerably better than one can do with loading devices intended to eliminate bend\xc2\xad\ning. Figure 8, B-L-H Drawing 206725-3 represents the channel specimen in the compression jig. The specimen\n\nis located in the center with the dowels acting as ceramic heat barriers. These have caps which are cemented\n\nto them, and are not numbered, but are shown with an arrow. Joints 4 and 5 on the assembly drawing are ball\n\nand socket joints. The system is rigid from the socket to the upper cross head shown on the left hand end\n\nof Drawing 2067254, and from the ball to the bottom of the pedestal which is free to be placed in any posi\xc2\xad\ntion on the lower cross head. It is so arranged that the upper section of the jig is installed before\n\npositioning the lower pedestal, thereby aligning everything properly. Thus, the jig consists of two rigid\n\nhalves. The ceramic pieces have been checked for maximum load capacity which was found to be about 12,000\n\npounds. Actually, the manufacturer\'s strength value on the ceramic pieces is very high. To make sure that\n\nthe jig was adequate, the system was tested many times with the pedestal in various positions, and the\n\nresults of these tests were considered very satisfactory.\n\nThe effectiveness of the thermal barriers on the compression specimen was checked since their function was\n\nto prevent a large heat sink at the end of the specimen rather than to protect other components. The speci\xc2\xad\nmens in both tension and compression on the channel jigs are provided with end heating elements which slide\n\nover the specimens. We use an oven with three-zone control and controls on each end heating element. With\n\nthese controls at 10000 F, we can maintain temperature at the center of the specimen within about 40 of the\n\nends. Figure 9, B-L-H Drawing 206707-4, shows the channel specimen in the tension jig and utilizes identi\xc2\xad\ncal end arrangements with the specimen located in the center. The end heaters are shown dotted. At each\n\nend there is a ball and socket which is shown between the numbers 4 and 5 on the drawing, and in our parti\xc2\xad\ncular setup, the bolt number 6 is also in a ball and socket on the testing machine. This bolt goes through\n\nthe cross head of the testing machine and is secured by a convex washer. The thermal barrier in this case\n\nis provided by stainless steel discs indicated by the number 3 on the drawing. About one hundred and fifty\n\nof these are required at each end. The interface heat transfer is very low, and provides the desired end\n\nresult. In the case of our tubular furnace, this extends over the piece indicated by the number 4 on the\n\ndrawing. This arrangement does not prevent piece number 4 from increasing in temperature, but it does\n\nprovide the desired isolation of the specimen. As stated before, the temperature is controlled within 40 F\n\nor 5OF over the entire specimen gage length at 1000 0F.\n\nFigure 10, B-L-H Drawing 20667-3 shows the assembled tension sheet metal specimen. This specimen is\n\ndesigned for testing in a creep chamber rather than in a tubular furnace. The specimen is shown on edge\xc2\xad\nin the center. The holes in the specimen are drilled with a jig to insure rapid change and maintaining\n\ngood alignment in the test jig. The knife edge shown near the number 6 and 7 is identical at both ends.\n\nThese provide a degree of freedom in one direction, while freedom in the other direction is provided by\n\npin number 3 shown on the drawing. The knife edge is a tool bit which has been ground to proper configura\xc2\xad\ntion. It is not fastened by welding since it is held in place by the other pieces that make up the assembly\n\nnumber 10. The knife socket that fits on the knife edge is also held by friction, and the other system\n\nfits between two sidearms. Two specimens were checked with this jig. One was essentially straight and\n\nthe other one was offset about one-eighth inch over its entire length. A preload of three hundred pounds\n\nwas required with the bowed specimen, but the one that was straight required about fifty pounds. Loads\n\nabove the preloads gave good straightening differentials as well as very accurate strain differentials on\n\nboth sides of the specimen. The fundamental principal involved in the test is that use is made of a\n\nstrain measuring device with the specimen. At present, nothing is available which is considered very\n\n8\n\nacceptable for this purpose.\n\nThe device has been designed for the evaluation of gages, not of specimens.\n\n\nThe aircraft industries have specified that true strain is to be measured, presumably by extensometers,\n\nand they have given stringent specifications concerning the design of the specimen. The specimen shown\n\nhere does not match these specifications in length. It would be preferable to have a larger area that we\n\ncould put gages on. The sheet metal specimen is for creep testing that would be taken off, principally\n\nafter 6000F. Creep or drift at 1O00OF is going to be a more difficult problem and we will probably try\n\nto solve it with our extension or universal testing machine and with a channel specimen. Anyone desiring\n\nprints of these drawings and details of the parts used in the assemblies may obtain them by writing to:\n\nBaldwin-Lina-Hamilton Corporation\n\nElectronics Division\n\nWaltham 54, Massachusetts\n\nThese specimens and testing procedures were brought about largely by NAS 942.\n\nOne of our serious problems\n\nright now with both of these specimens is the lack of an extensometer that is better than a strain gage.\n\nPlease inform us where we can get one because, at the present time, within the normal ranges of some of\n\nthese specimen materials, strain gages are far better than any extensometer we can get to compare them to.\n\nThe Tuckerman is good. as long as you stay within its temperature limitations.\n\n\n9\n\n\nHIGH ACCURACY ASPECTS OF TRANSDUCER DESIGN\n\nFrank F. Hines\n\nB-L-H Corporation\n\n\nIt is well known that a strain gage, bonded to an elastic member and calibrated in terms of force or pres\xc2\xad\nsure, can be termed a transducer. To be completely general the strain gage itself is a transducer. However,\nthe term "transducer" is usually reserved for a combination of elements including one or more gages bonded\nto some kind of a mechanical stiucture which is used to convert some physical phenomena such as pressure,\n\nforce, load, torque or displacement into strain of the gage which results in an electrical signal.\n\nThis involves two elements in the transducer which can create errors:\n\na. The mechanical transduction element\n\nb. The strain gage installation\n\nOne cannot always separate the effects of the two, but at least one can reasonably describe what is happening\n\nwith both. The paramount cause of error in this type of transducer is a change in temperature during oper\xc2\xad\nation. The effect of temperature change can appear in the zero reading of the instrument, the output of the\n\nbridges, or on the stability of the bridge circuits. The zero shift is probably the easiest of these to\n\ncorrect. The difference in the temperature coefficient of the gages that form the bridge circuits often\n\ncause serious error. For a half bridge and the full bridge, there is opportunity to obtain compensating\n\neffects from the absolute temperature coefficient of the gages because of the inherent nature of the bridge\n\ncircuit. This is true theoretically, but rarely do two gages on a load or pressure sensing element have\n\nexactly the same temperature coefficient. Inevitably, there is some random difference between the two or\n\nfour gages on an element, and therefore, there is a residual temperature coefficient in the bridge.\n\nThe difference in gage behavior can be caused by a number of things such as a random deviation of the gage\n\nitself, or a difference in the expansion characteristics of the structure on which the gages are cemented.\n\nThere can be a curvature effect where some of the gages are applied to surfaces with relatively sharp radii\n\nand others are on flat surfaces. There can also be variations in the basic temperature coefficient of the\n\nbridge circuit. These are relatively easy to correct for by temperature cycling the transducer to determine\n\nthe deviation of the zero reading versps the temperature. Knowing this, one can open the bridge circuit\n\nand introduce into the appropriate arm another resistor having the known temperature coefficient which will\n\ncompensate for the residual temperature effect on the bridge. Therefore, by adjusting the bridge, one can\n\nachieve a zero temperature coefficient under no load conditions.\n\nTheoretically, this can provide a zero\n\ntemperature coefficient; actually, it is more difficult since one has to repeat the process several times.\n\nAnother very important effect of temperature is on the output of a transducer caused by two major effects.\n\nFirst, the mechanical structure of the element is like a spring; the amount of deformation is dependent on\n\nthe modulus of elasticity of the material. This modulus is not constant with temperature, but will change\n\nfrom one and a half to two percent per 100 0 F. Second. in addition to this error is the gage factor change\n\nwith temperature. Some of these errors are compensating, but usually no attempt is made to separate the\n\nvarious effects. The simple way to compensate for such errors is to introduce a temperature-sensing resis\xc2\xad\ntor into the input leads of the bridge circuit, thus reducing the actual voltage on the bridge by the same\n\namount that the modulus is decreasing and the output is increasing. If all these parameters are adjusted\n\ncorrectly, the output versus temperature under any given load conditions will be linear. The conventional\n\ncircuit diagram for load cells using modulus compensation resistors in the circuit is a temperature sensi\xc2\xad\ntive voltage attenuator that adjusts the voltage on the load sensing portion of the bridge to compensate\n\nfor the change in output versus temperature.\n\n\n10\n\n\nGoing further into the various effects on the bridge, one finds the problem of creep and hysteresis of\n\ngages, or of the metal on which the gages are mounted. Another effect is zero drift which is different\n\nfrom zero temperature coefficient shift. Terminology can confuse these two effects. There is thermo\xc2\xad\nelectric effect which is usually no problem in bnded strain gages because there are two thermocouple\n\njunctions on each gage which are opposed and so close together the residual thermo-electric voltage is\n\nnegligible. Linearity may be considered either an error or a fact, but many transducers can be linearized\n\ndeliberately, either electrically or mechanically.\n\nProbably the most difficult thermal effect to correct for is an unequal distribution of temperature\n\nthroughout the physical structure of the transducer. To be completely honest, I do not know how to\n\ncorrect for this because it is unpredictable. It is difficult to place gages to compensate for random\n\ntemperature gradients within the transducer. The best advice for these conditions, is to insulate the\n\ntransducer and they do not experience transient temperatures or gradients. When worse comes to worse,\n\nhowever, one can compensate each and every individual strain gage in the bridge in a normal temperature\n\ncompensation. This will do much for elimination of effect of uneven temperature distribution within a\n\ntransducer but it will not correct it all.\n\nAnother problem that will arise for missile people is that they are going to have to decide which is to\n\nbe measured, weight or force.\n\nIt so happens that most of the standard units at the present time are based\n\n\non the gravitational constant of Washington, D.C. and the particular calibrated masses in Washington. If\n\none takes those same weights to another part of the country, one no longer has the same force. In other\n\nwords, the accuracy of many load transducers is such that one can see the difference in the gravitational\n\nconstants over the various areas of the country. What one does about this is a matter of definition.\n\nWhat gets the missile off the ground is the excess of thrust over weight at that particular location.\n\nQuestion. What order of magnitude is this gravitational change?\nAnswer:\n\nIt amounts to a fraction of a hundredth of a percent or a couple of hundredths of a percent.\nBetween Waltham, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., it amounts to 4 pounds in 10,000. For\na 10,000 pound weight calibrated in Washington, four more pounds must be added to the weight\nto make it correct.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIs this effected by latitude or longitude?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\nLatitude,. I believe.\n\nAs a matter of fact, it is difficult to find the real standard number for\n\n\nthe gravitational constant, or anyplace where the gravitational constant fits the standard\n\nfigure.\n\n\n11\n\n\nSPECIAL PURPOSE TRANSDUCERS\n\nKeith McFarland\n\nAmes Research Center\n\n\nThe Ames Research Center is a complex of some six major wind tunnel systems plus a relatively large\n\nnumber of smaller wind tunnels and special research facilities. These research facilities include such\n\nthings as a high velocity ballistic range, supersonic preflight tunnels, atmosphere entry simulators, a\n\nlow density and heat transfer facilities, iron beam apparatus, flight simulators, etc. The primary func\xc2\xad\ntion of the Ames Research Center has been research in the field of high speed flight, and with the advent\n\nof the NASA, we are working more in the field of space research in support of space projects. We are\n\ncontinuing work in high speed supersonic flight and at the present time have a very important mission in\n\nVIOL and STOL aircraft, which is an important field.\n\nIn support of these particular programs and these facilities, the Facilities Instrumentation Research\n\nBranch is required to provide a wide variety of mechanical, electrical, and optical, measuring systems and\n\ntransducers. A relatively large portion of these transducers utilize resistance strain gages. There are\n\na number of reasons for this. First, is the basic advantages of the resistance strain gage, and second,\n\nis the availability of a wide variety of excellent strain gage instrumentation. A third reason is that\n\nAmes has been fortunate enough to assemble a small but highly skilled group of strain gage technicians.\n\nAssuming that a strain gage transducer is the most economical way to make a large number of our measure\xc2\xad\nments, one might ask why commercial transducers are not always used. Of course, this is the best solution\n\nto many of the problems, and this is what is done except for the conditions requiring special purpose\n\ntransducers. These may involve a peculiar configuration, special range, special accuracy, or practical\n\nconsideration of ecdnomy and time.\n\nSpecial configurations may require a transducer on a strut in a model, on the end of a sting, or the trans\xc2\xad\nducer may be required in a minimum shape or size to measure more than one parameter. A higher or a lower\n\nrange transducer than is available commercially may be needed, or it may have to withstand any number of\n\nparameters -such as extreme temperature, shock, vibrations, or any number of special conditions which a\n\nstandard commercial transducer is not specifically designed to withstand. In the case of accuracy, there\n\nare now available sbme very high accuracy transducers on the market, but there are certain conditions where\n\nhigh accuracy is required in a particular range where one might need to build his own transducer. In the\n\ncase of economy, there are situations that would justify the use of special purpose transducers, although\n\ncommercial transducers usually cost less than a specially built transducer. Changes in test schedules can\n\n-require transducers on short notice which means fabrication at the test facility.\n\nThere is an almost unlimited variety of shapes and types of strain elerlents that can be used in meeting\n\nvarious specifications. These include bending beams, columns, rings, diaphragms and torque bars. There\n\nis seldom only a single design that would satisfy the requirements of any given situation. Here are a few\n\nconsiderations that might help in the development of a transducer for a given set of conditions. First, the\n\ntransducer should be made as simple and rugged as possible, since in most cases, minimum deflection is desir\xc2\xad\nable. Try to avoid all pins and screw joints in the actual body of the transducer. The figures show that\n\nmost of the Ames\' transducers are machined from one piece, which has not been found uneconomical. A second\n\nitem concerns the actual beam stiffness. The beam element, particularly in bending, should be made as stiff\n\nas possible so that the strain gages carry a negligible portion of the load. For high accuracy transducers,\n\nwe try to design for.modest strain levels, primarily in the range of 500 microstrain. Another consideration\n\nis to design with thermal problems in mind, particularly thermal gradients.\n12\n\n\nThe gage placement should mini\xc2\xad\n\nThe same thing is true of loads.\n\nmize these effects during operation of the transducer.\n\nmeasure normal force shou-ld ignore lateral and torsion forces.\n\nA transducer to\n\n\nTo do this, it is best to design the mechani\xc2\xad\n\ncal system of the transducer so that this force does not effect the strain element. Often gages can be\n\narranged to cancel out unwanted stresses, but it is better to design the mechanical system so they are\n\neliminated. Using these various design considerations, we have made many transducers at Ames.\n\n\n-2\xc2\xad\n\n:1V\n\n44\n\n-\n\nN\n\nA-27777-?\n\nA7NARNIfC\n\no-\n\n4.\nL Z>\n\n-.\n\nOfh~O\n\n_1\n\nK\n\n.~------2\n\nFigure 1. Ames Research Center of National Aeronautics\n\nand Space Administration. Moffett Field, California.\n\nFigure 1 is a view of Ames-Research Center. The big building at the left of the picture is the 40\' x 80\'\n\nWind Tunnel where we are doing a relatively large amount of strain gage work in connection with VTOL testing.\n\nThe complex immediately above the 40\' x 80\' Wind Tunnel is the Unitary Wind Tunnel composed of three major\n\ntransonic-superxonic tunnels operating on the sane power system.\n\nAt the extreme upper left are vacuum spheres\n\n\nfor the three and one-half foot facility which has capabilities of mach 10 to 15 in the high temperature range.\n\nFigure 2 is a transducer milled from a rectangular block of 17-4PH steel to obtain the desired beam shape.\n\nThe block is slotted to form a shear beam or a double cantilever with no moment across the center of the\n\nbeam length. An advantage of this design, beside simplicity, is its lack of sensitivity to bending moments.\n\nThis transducer also has flexures on it to make it even less affected by moments. The thermal gradients through\n\nthe transducer are such that their effect on the gages is minimized. The deflection is very low, the deflec\xc2\xad\ntionbeing less than a thousandth of an inch for the gage beam lenQth of one inch. This particular unit has\n\nbeen equipped with stops so that when overloaded in tension or compression it becomes a rigid structure. Con\xc2\xad\nsequently, this type of transducer can carry loads almost 10 times the rated capacity without damage.\n\n13\n\nA-26008\n\nNioAMC-ICMO\n\ng~\n\nFigure 2. High Accuracy 27 lb. Force Transducer (tension)\n\nThe transducer of Figure 2 was designed for twenty-seven pounds full scale, with a tare load of nine pounds\n\nand operates with an accuracy of approximately one-tenth percent at room temperature. This type has been\n\nbuilt in enough quantity to obtain statistical data concerning the performance. Twelve were made of 17-4 PH\n\nsteel of which six were instrumented with ABF-11 gages, which are bakelite fine wire flat grid gagest and six\n\nhad foil gages on them. All installations were satisfactory, but the ABF-11 gages were significantly better\n\nin terms of hysteresis and linearity. This unit is used-in electronic computing of the platform forces in\n\nthe 40\' x 80\' Wind Tunnel.\n\nFigure 3 shows a similar type transducer for moment-balancing compressor blades for one of our wind tunnels.\nFigures 4, 5 and 6 show transducers that were developed for a special purpose and to fit a particular config\xc2\xad\nuration. The 40\' x 80\' \'lind Tunnel is now being used for vertical takeoff and landing studies, but the mas\xc2\xad\nsive floating frame platform has too low a frequency to respond to dynamic changes in lift and other parameters.\nIt was desirable to have a multiple component force unit to fit on the end of the existing strut system and\nmount on the models under test.\nFigure 4 shows a transducer designed for 3000 pounds normal and 2250 pounds axial force. The normal force\n\nproduces a double bending in the two outboard flexures, while the axial force transmits a tension and com\xc2\xad\npression through the outboard flexures and produces bending on the inboard flexures. All forces are measured\n\nin bending, and the resolution between the applied loads is very good; i.e., when a normal force is applied,\n\nthere are negligible effects on the chord force.\n\n\n14\n\n\n" \n\n\nT\n\nTwo-Component Force Transducer\n\nFigure 4. \t\n3,000 lbs.

Although the inter-action error was relatively high to begin with, a very small\n\nch~ange in angular position of the gage reduced it to one percent.\n\nFigure 6 is a 15,000 pound load cell of a different design. Each time tbe load increased substantially,\n\nwe ran into different problems which necessitated new designs. We tried to go back to the first two com\xc2\xad\nponent unit of Figure 4 and use tension-compression beams in place of bending flexures. Deflection w~as\n\nexcessive and the design of Figure 6 was evolved as the solution.\nFigure 7 is an entirely different type of transducer. In our ballistic facilities, and we have quite a\n\nfew of them, we use strain gage devices to measure the ballistic pressures which vary from 10,000 psi up\n\nto 400,000 psi. A piston with a strain cage wound around it is clamped into the ballistic barrel. The\n\npressure is sealed with a neoprene "0" ring which withstands the very high temperatures and high pressures\nthat act over a very short period of time. The piston diameter is about an eighth of an inch for the\n\nstandard unit. Unit A of Figure 8 is a 100,000 psi unit-, and the one on the right is a two step measuring\n\ndevice which is a bending beam for measuring low pressures plus a column.\n\nFigure 9 shows some older type pressure transducers. These units are flush diaphragm pressure cells, and\n\nthe ones in the center are about 0.2 of an inch inside diameter. We used ABF-11 gages for a while, and\n\nthen wound our owm spiral gages, flattened the wire and mounted them. At present we are using Baldwin spiral\n\ngages one-eighth inch in diameter.\n\n16\n\n\nit\'\n\n"!"\n\n6. Two-Component\nTransducer\n\n%Force\n__\n\n__Figure\n\n15,000 lbs. Normal\n\n12,000 lbs.

Curry\nBoeing Airplane Company\n\n\nAt this time the Boeing Company has in use approximately 90 internal sting balances.\n\nA three-page tabu\xc2\xad\n\nlation in Appendix B shows most of them and the facilities for which they were designed. Each page of the\ntabulation contains balances associated with a specific type of vehicle. There is considerable variation\nin appearance for we have no philosophy tending to standardize configuration; instead, we try to select\nthe measuring technique that is most suitable to the situation.\nThe Boeing Wind Tunnel Laboratory Unit consists of five major wind tunnels in addition to two pilot tunnels,\n\ntwo shock tunnels, one hypersonic aeroballistic range. In addition, we conduct force tests in out-of-town\n\nfacilities, and keep approximately a dozen facilities occupied with our force tests.\n\nWe are now working on our six hundredth model in the last 16 years. Consequently, we use our balances for\n\nmore than just the models for which they were designed. Host of our balances are designed for a specific\n\nmodel and tailored to a specific Boeing facility. Design criteria differ for balances used in different\n\nfacilities. For example, in our transonic tunnel, temperature is one of the most significant quantities\n\nwhich must be considered in design. Our supersonic tunnel, which is a blowdown tunnel, requires a design\n\n\n"d"\n\n+ /I\n1ct\n+a\n\nn.\n\n-,\n\nEnvelope of maximum\ndesign bending moments\n\nCenter of pressure\ncorresponding to\ntest condition \'C"\n\ndesignn\n\nbending moment\n\nSupport member\n\ncondition\nst\n,conition\n"a"\n\nStation corresponding\nto the min. design \t\nbending moment \t\n\nNOTE: Slope of the\nmoment curves is\nproportional to the\napplied force (eg\nintegrated pressure)\n\nN\nMoment center\n\nTransverse loads\n\nAxial forc\n\nmeasuring elements\n\nmeasuring element\n\nFigure 1. Typical internal force balance installation\n\nand external loads.\n\n21\n\n\nwith factors of safety which consider starting and shock loads.\n\nIn our hypersonic tunnel we must watercool\n\n\nthe balances, and in hot-shot testing, frequency response is of prime importance.\n\nOur balance designs conm\xc2\xad\n\nply with test requirements, and reflect the facilities at our disposal for design, fabrication, gaging and\n\ncalibration data reduction.\n\nBoeing places considerable emphasis on wind tunnel testing, and gives priority usage of computers to aid in\n\nselection of configurations for balances, in doing stress analysis on the.selected configurations, and in\n\nreducing calibration data. We have two electric discharge milling machines: a Japax, which is, Japanese\n\na\nmachine, and a Swiss copy of this Japanese machine called an Eleroda. These machines give more freedom in\n\ndesign than conventional milling machines, allowing best usage of the space available.\n\nGreat emphasis is placed on reliability in design and development of our balances, since this is more impor\xc2\xad\ntant than accuracy, which seems to have been realized. A greater effort is made to minimize random and unpre\xc2\xad\ndictable errors rather than predictable errors, such as interactions, because we have facilities for handling\n\nthem. Extra compensation equipment is minimized that would be associated directly with the models, balances\n\nand readout systems. To simplify test installations, mathematical compensation is relied upon heavily.\n\nThe first topic that I will\n\ndiscuss relative to specific\n\n\nN \n\nLOAD SYSTEM \n\n\ndesigns is the technique we\n\n\ncall "stress-cancellation moment\n\n\nStransfer". \n\n\nBecause of space\n\n\nlimitations in these balances,\n\nthe axial force element is the\n\nweakest section in bending.\n\n(2b)N\nFREE BODY \n\nDIAGRAMS\n\nFigure 1 represents a model supported by a sting showing the\n\nR\n\nmoment diagrams of the support\nmember for various critical\ntest conditions.

We place the moment gages at a point of zero stress due to normal force on the structure.\n\nTherefore, they are out of the influence of the normal force irrespective of its magnitude.\n\nFigure 2 shows the development of the princeples that have been mentioned. Figure 2a is a diagram showing\n\na simple two-legged device with forces and moment applied at the moment center which is remote from the cen\xc2\xad\nter of the cage. Figure 2b is a free body diagram of the split cage.\n\nExternal loads are balanced by the\n\n\nvertical reactions and internal moments. Figure 2c is the stress diagram due to the bending moment about\n\nthe center of the cage. The heavily shaded portion is that part of the moment which is due to normal force\n\ntimes transfer distance. The lesser shaded area is that portion of the moment which is caused by pitching\n\nmoment.\n\nFigure 2d is a stress diagram due to the vertical shear (normal force) only.\n\n\nFigure 3 superimposes the stress due to the vertical shear caused by normal force on top of the bending\n\nstress due to normal force times transfer distance. The upper surface of the top beam (AA1 has a point (X\n\nm\n\nwhere there is zero stress due to normal force. On the under surface of the beam the point of zero stress\nis behind the center of the cage.\n\nEither of these two points would be satisfactory for locating pitching\n\n\nmoment gages.\n\nFigure 4 shows a small stress\ncancellation moment transfer\ntype balance designed for three\n\nN\n7\n\ncomponent testing of "Dynasoar"\nin our eight inch Hotshot tun-Vx\nnel where the importance of\n\n,\n\n4\n\nnatural frequency was stressed.\nWe achieved 250 cycles per\n\n_\n\n__\n\n-\n\n_\n\nI\n\nsecond in the pitch plane and\n1000 cycles per second in the\naxial force direction.

To satisfy the requirements for a good working balance with suitable factors of safety and adequate\n\nmeasured stress under these conditions is very difficult; Included in Supplement 2 of Appendix B are the\n\ndevelopment of mathematics and derivations for a five-component moment transfer cage. The asterisked equa\xc2\xad\ntions have been programied for digital computing to aid in configuration selection, which is done on an\n\niterative basis.\n\nA general mathematical statement is given in Supplement 3 of Appendix B for the stress analysis of a parallel\n\nmember prismatic beam after the configuration has been selected. The first part contains the derivation of\n\nexpressions for internal reactions in terms of geometric configuration and external loads. The next section\n\nin the analysis is the tabulation of these internal reactions. The three internal forces and three internal\n\nmoments acting on each member are determined, followed by the computation of overall safety stresses which\nare the combined stresses; i.e., combined effective tensile and combined effective shear. Equations are writ\xc2\xad\nten in terms of such things as the moment of inertia, and area. Written sub-routines are included for compu\xc2\xad\nting various inputs to the program for different cross-sectional shapes. These sub-routines aid in a stress\n\nanalysis, since one merely has to indicate the beam geometry by indicating the configuration number with\ndimensions of the members. This program has been worked out for rectangles, octagons, vertical I-beams,\nhorizontal I-beams,\n\nvertical "T\'s" and horizontal "T\'s".\n\n\nThe design of a balaice for a Hotshot facility is quite simple since loads are low for a given size model\nand compact assembly is not mandatory. In addition, temperature is a minor problem because thermal inertia\nof the model prevents the balance from changing temperature during the "blow", which lasts about a 25th of a\nsecond. However, high frequency response is extremely important. de do not use inertia compensation but\n\ndesign our balances to such high natural frequencies that inertial response frequencies are separated from\n\nthe frequency components of the aerodynamic forcing function by as much as possible. The inertial frequencies\n\nare then filtered out with electronic filters.\n\n\nFigure.6.\n\nBalance Number 6143 assembly.\n\nFigure 7.

Thus, a great percentage of the total load is carried by members which are designed with\n\nlarge sections wlhich contributes to their high natural frequency.

Tracy\nThe Task Corporation\n\n\nThe term "balance" warrants an explanation since it is obtained from the earliest use of force measuring\n\ndevices in wind tunnels which were balances. Dead weight was either hung from pans or moved on beams. to\n\ncounteract applied aerodynamic forces. The original devices were called external balances and are still\n\nused to some extent in numerous facilities with high accuracy where there is no space restriction. How\xc2\xad\never, other limitations led to the development of "sting balance". This was made possible by use of re\xc2\xad\nsistance wire strain gages which allowed a localized strain measurement.\n\nThe first sting balances were essentially beams milled to provide a surface for strain gages and were fairly\n\ncrude in a modern sense. A later development, brought about by reduction of the strain gage size, is the\n\nfloating frame internal balance which is philosophically similar to the external balance except it is turned\n\ninside out. Instead of supporting the model with external stress members attached to force transducersi\n\nthe model is supported by internal stress which carries force transducers attached to an interior structural\n\nmember.\n\nIt is worthwhile to delineate between the "single piece balance" and the "floating frame balance".\n\nThe prin\xc2\xad\nciple of the single piece balance is that a set of applied forces on a cantilever member uniquely determines\nthe state of strain throughout the body of the cantilever member. Of course, it is impossible to measure the\nstate of strain throughout a body which eliminates the possibility of obtaining forces from partial strains.\nIf such a thing were possible, then it could be written in the form of equation (1) in Appendix C. This is\nan equation for the output of a strain gage or a bridge of strain gages mounted at the unique location on the\nsurface of the body and its output is\'a linear combination of products from all the applied forces or moments,\n\ntaking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 at a time. This is not the most elaborate equation that could be written for the\n\noutput of these components, but a mathematician would guess that it is probably adequate. However, it is a\n\ndifficult equation to use to determine forces from an electrical output. There are six of these equations\n\nand each equation has six major terms which are a summation involving about 300,000 coefficients.\nnot calibrate such a balance, much less reduce the data involved.\n\nA practical limit is\'represented by equation (2).\n\nOne could\n\n\nThis is an equation containing two terms, each of which\n\n\nis a sunation of forces taken one or two at a time. This equation is worth mentioning in more detail\n\nbecause it is typical of the actual equation used in reducing wind tunnel balance data. This equation says\n\nthe output of each element is a sum of six terms, each of which is a constant times a single applied force,\n\nplus another sum involving a constant times the product of pairs of forces taken two at a time. It is\n\npractically reducible or Invertible so you can solve for the applied forces in terms of the electrical out\xc2\xad\nput. The first terms in this equation are called linear outputs. They are first order terms, one term\n\nbeing the float coefficient and the remaining term being the first order interaction. The second term\n\ninvolves quadric non-linearities of primary outputs. These are interactions that arise as a result of two\n\nforces being applied simultaneously and is based on the single piece balance which has been shown to be very\n\nsuccessful. Mr. Tom Curry stated their facility uses this type of balance in various configurations. I\n\nthink, however, they exhibit some difficulties which led to consideration of a different type of balance.\n\nOne of the difficulties mentioned was performance which is sensitive to location of the strain gages.\n\nReduced strain gage size led to the attempt to build an external balance inside out which was done some 15\n\nyears ago for the first time. The system is "ideally" a statically determinate system involving isolated\n\ntransducers to measure six force or moment components supporting a model. To accomplish this statically\n\n29\n\ndeterminate "ideal" depends to a great extent on the applied loads, the ratio of loads, and the means used\n\nIf you have seen rocket thrust stands, which are external balances philosophi\xc2\xad\n\nto isolate the transducer.\n\ncally similar to the internal balance I shall discuss, you are probably aware that there are a number of\n\npossible arrangements of these force measuring transducers. In fact, there are a limitless variety of\n\narrangements which permit a resolution of applied forces into distinguishable, individual components of\n\nforce.\n\nIn the internal balance, the.package space which contains the force resolution system is very limi\xc2\xad\nted and very repeatable. It is usually a cyclindrical body, circular in cross section, or nearly so and\n\nfairly long. This shape restricts the possible ways of resolving forces mechanically and results in a\n\nparticular force resolution system which is shown in Figure 1. The tapered member at the back of the attach\xc2\xad\nment is for mounting to the sting support. The pair of vertical elements which we call forward and aft\n\nnormal force, resolve normal force and pitching moment. The pair of similarly spaced side force elements\n\nresolve side force and yawing moment; an axial member carries axial or cord force loads, and a torque tube\n\nmeasures rolling moments and carries the same. This arrangement is very successful. In principle, this\n\nbalance has no difficulties in that each transducer is isolated from all of the loads but the one to be\n\nmeasured. By using a perfect pivot at each end a transducer is obtained which is insensitive to stray loads\n\nand only sensitive to a primary load so that interaction effects are non-existent.\n\nObviously, minimiiing deflections in its crucial end, and improving the performance and reducing the second\n\norder interaction, in.addition to the other criteria, such as natural frequency should be optimized if pos\xc2\xad\nsible. The actual internal balance of the floating frame type deviates somewhat from an ideal balance for\n\nseveral reasons. The elements themselves deflect and cause deformation of the balance. The transducers\n\nmay be sensitive to extraneous or lateral loads and its performance my not be ideal nor proportional nor\n\nrepeatable, etc. Finally, the transducers may be sensitive to the thermal environment.\n\nThe floating frame balance is susceptible to a fundamental error which the idpel single piece balance is not.\n\nThe error is its sensitivity to thermal environments, and the unwanted outputs due to thermal changes. This\n\nis not to be confused with thermal strain or lack of compensation on the bridges, but is an actual force\n\nthat occurs on the transducer because of thermal gradients in the balance. This type of balance develops\n\nforces in the presence of a thermal gradient in a multiply-connected region. Modifications of the trans\xc2\xad\nducer such as moving the axial and roll element to the center, halfway between the normal and side force\n\nelement precluded thermal forces arising from the model and the balance. This mutation of the original\n\nforce resolving arrangement is the one that we currently use. It is the most acceptable force resolving\n\narrangement and is thermally inert.\n\nA\n\nLet us now consider, in detail, the floating frame balance and not consider in detail the single piece bal\xc2\xad\nance because it has been discussed, and I am more familiar with the floating frame balance. The design of\n\nthis balance is a very highly integrated problem involving a great deal of structural and electronic trans\xc2\xad\nducer design. I will divide the design into that of a mechanical force resolution problem, structural\n\nproblem, pivot design, transducer design, and odds and ends such as an attachment, calibrations and selection\n\nof a balance. We shall, henceforth be dealing with the system shown in Figure 2. The figure is a cutaway\n\nview of a typical balance and with careful inspection, one can see the normal force elements at each end,\n\nand the side force elements at inboarded ends, two axial members sharing the applied axial load and two torque\n\ntubes sharing the applied rolling moment. This is the thermally compensated floating frame balance. The\n\nstructural problem for this balance is severe. Strength of the inner member, which has the sting attachment\n\njoint, is the load limiting factor. Pivots in this type of balance are very definitive on the performance\n\nof the balance. They have backlash, and hysteresis resulting from occasional large deflections affects the\n\nbalance performance adversely. The only pivot that approaches our requirements is the elastic pivot, and\n\nthe simplest type is composed of flat strapped flexures. These pivots have one drawback, and that is that\n\nthey are not rotationally free, since they have an elastic restoring moment. It is necessary to examine the\n\nnature of that restoring moment and its effect on balance performancet which is accomplished in equations 3\n\n30\n\nthrough 8 and explanations. Equation 8 is very important because it shows the analytical results correct\n\nin that flexure length is not dominant, but thickness and spacing is dominant in making an internal balance,\n\nrocket component stand, or any force resolving system using transducers and flexures.\n\nThe length of a flexure beyond a certain point does nothing to improve the quality of the system, and such\n\nan elastic pivot is a very complex device. Figure 5 shows some of the most important characteristics.\n\nFurther discussion of the behavior of an elastic pivot or flexure under applied axial loading will attempt\n\nto answer how applied load affects the center of rotation change and what angle of rotation is allowable.\n\nAlso, further discussion will explain the restoring moment change, which may be a surprising fact to some.\n\nAnalysis shows that the flexure is not a device that has a given fixed stiffness to deflection, but depends\n\non how much axial load is being carried.\n\nFigure 5 shows the change of center of rotations, non-dimensionalized by\'the length of the flexure strap, as\n\na function of applied load over the yield load. The left hand plot of Figure 6 has an abcissa of P over Per\n\nand the right hand plot is P over Per, while the center plot also has P over Per. \nIn the center of Figure 6\n\nis a plot of allowable angular rotation undimensionalized by the maximum allowable rotation as a function of\n\napplied load over yield load. Deflection for several yield load over critical buckling load are shown and\n\nas the yield load approaches the critical buckling load, the allowable angular rotation drops off very rapidly.\n\nThis is not very important for balances for which these angular rotations are of the order of milliradians.\n\nFinally, the most important plot for our purposes shows the rotational stiffness divided by the rotational\n\nstiffness at no load as a function of applied load over critical buckling load. The rotational thickness\n\nincreases with compression load and is essentially infinity at the buckling load.\n\nBy increasing the length of a flexure, the buckling load is reduced so that the fixed rate of axial load is\n\na bigger percentage of the buckling load. Thus, the change in restoring moment is greater and greater as the\n\nflexure is lengthened. The flexure is lengthened to improve force resolution; however, the flexure becomes\n\nmore non-linear so the restoring moment depends heavily on the load it is carrying which is a first order\n\ninteraction.\n\nIn our balances we use circular arc flexures which are very difficult to analyze, so we relate it to an equiv\xc2\xad\nalent flat strap. In other words, a circular arc flexure whose total length is equal to the diameter of the\n\nhole that forms it is equivalent to a flat strap of shorter length with thickness equal to the minimum thick\xc2\xad\nness of the circular arc flexure. These effective lengths are shown in Figure 6. The effective length with\nwhich we are operating in most of our balances is between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 times the flexure thickness; a very\nshort, thick flexure, and the critical buckling load is far above the yield load so that we are operating in\n\na very small band of the restgring moment change curve shown at the top of Figure 6. If we find that the\n\nforce resolution is not as complete as we like it,that the redundancy is high, rather than lengthening the\n\nflexures by making long straps of them or by making larger hole diameters, we reduce the thickness. Reduc\xc2\xad\ning the thickness reduces the bending and improves the resolution of forces because the thickness over the\n\nflexure separation appears squared in the expression indicating how well they resolve forces. Ile\nhave made\n\nbalances with fairly long flexure straps, and we have come up with very significant second order interactions\n\nwhich we will eventually trace to this effect.\n\ne use the equation (9) through flexual redundancy equalling 6 1 2 as a means of establishing a load\n\ncriteria within which the balance should operate well. The allowable normal force capacity for an ideal or\n\ngood balance is about 500 pounds for a one inch balance, with scales up and down according to the square of\n\nthe diameter. If we double the load capacity, then we have to double the required flexure thickness, and\nthis increases the redundency of the balance by a factor of four. This factor very quickly becomes signifi\xc2\xad\ncant if we consider balances with a 10 to 1 normal to cord force ratio. Instead of losing 3 to 10 percent\nof the applied cord force through the other flexures, 50 or 60 percent of the applied force is lost.\n31\n\nThe transducer has to fit into the balance and it has to be sensitive to the loads if one desires a sense\n\nin the balance. Beyond that, it should have low deflection, linear output, low hysteresis, repeatibility,\n\ninsensitivity to extraneous moments, insensitivity to thermal environment, insensitivity to pressure change,\n\nhumidity and should be readily manufacturable with accuracy. The transducers that are usually used in bal\xc2\xad\nances are the tension type reading direct uniaxial stress; eccentric column which is a bending type element\n\nand ring type which is also a bending element. Probably the most important criterion, which should be opti\xc2\xad\nmized is deflection. Deflection is calculated using principles of conservation of energy. We use this\n\nmethod because it shows a very important consideration in transducer design which is illustrated by equation\n\n\n(20).\nThe analysis has been carried out for the case of a pure bending member. For the same surface strain level,\ncomparison of the equation (22) with equation (20) shows the deflection to be approximately 1/3 as much for\na bending member as it is for an axial member. Unfortunately, all of the.transducers that appear in a float\xc2\xad\ning frame balance are axially oriented members so cur bending members are essentially eccentric columns. In\naddition to a bending strain, we have an axial strain; consequently, the equation (22) does not strictly\n\napply to our transducers. This correction has been made resulting in equation (27) as an expression for\n\naxial deflection. An eccentric column is minimized at an eccentricity ratio of 0.3. When the eccentricity\n\nis reduced below this value, a constant bending stress is maintained, but less, because the member is getting\n\nthinner and thinner, and it is deflecting in the mode of a tension type element. Since this stress is not\n\nbeing measured, this is the optimum eccentric column; i.e., eccentricity from a deflection standpoint.\n\nA ring element has much more deflection than an eccentric column or a tension type. There are reasons for\n\nusing rings in situations where one can tolerate these excessive deflections. It appears that there are no\n\nrestrictions to deflections if one is able to make the thickness of the gage or strain member approach zero.\n\nThis is not practical since the gage must dissipate heat to prevent serious thermal effects. However. some\n\nshear elements can be made with very thin webs because the member that is carrying shear has heavy flanges.\n\nThis type of gage can be used for measuring shear, with resulting small deflections because the volume of\n\nthe strain material is very small.\n\nLinear members are more useful in data reduction since non-linearity is a second order interaction or equiva\xc2\xad\nlent. A tension type element is non-linear in the sense that output decreases with applied compressive loads\n\nand increases with applied tensile loads. A bending element of this type, either a ring or eccentric column,\n\nis non-linear in the opposite sense. \'Output increases in compression. The results are due respectively to\n\nthe fact that a tension type member or compression member will increase in its cross sectional area under\n\ncompressive loading due to Poisson\'s ratio. On the other hand, a bending type element has its eccentricity\n\nincreased under compressive loading due to the bending. Equation (28) is an approximate expression for non\xc2\xad\nlinearity in an eccentric column, and includes both the bending of an eccentric column and the Poisson\'s\n\nratio increase of the section due to axial strain in the column. The expression shows that if the column\n\nlength or the column thickness is equal to about twice Poisson\'s ratio the non-linearity disappears. This\n\nusually is not possible since strain gages have a finite length and Poisson\'s ratio is rather small. In the\n\ndenominator we have the expression eccentricity over thickness so that by increasing eccentricity we reduce\n\nnon-linearity. However, it was previously pointed out that the eccentricity should be 1/3 or less for mini\xc2\xad\nmum deflection. This is one of the many dilemas we are faced with, and we normally allow the non-linearity\n\nand try to obtain the minimum deflection in our bending element, although there are cases where this is not\n\ndone.\n\nThe attachments shown in Figure 9 are considered to be a disadvantage by many people because they are a\n\njoint in the system which permits friction, motion and hysteresis. They have an advantage in that they per\xc2\xad\nmit adjustments to be made in the positioning of elements that eliminate interactions in the first place.\n\n\n32\n\n\nThey permit removal of the elements without cutting the balance apart for repair or changing the load\n\nrange. This configuration also permits stops to be placed in the balance between the outer sleeve and\n\ninner structural member to carry overload. In ordering a balance, regardless of the type, bear in mind\n\nthat when it is smaller than will fit into the model, a very severe penalty is present because of the\n\nincreased flexure thickness that is required for such a model. Allowable force and roll capacity are\nassociated-respectively, with balance diameter squared and cubed. One loses very rapidly by going to\n\nsmller balances than required. Ordering a balance with a very high output or using high bridge voltages\n\ncan materially depreciate balance performance.\n\n\n33\n\nINEXPENSIVE STRAIN GAGE TRANSDUCERS\n\nLockheedf\n\n.Pierre M. Hahn\n\nsile and Space Division\n\n\nAny transducer, except perhaps a friction scale, is rather expensive when it requires strain gages. Instru\xc2\xad\nmentation is required which increases the cost. For most of the testing involved in the development of rocket\n\nengines and attachments to these engines, loads and forces must be measured. This often is accomplished\n\nexpediently and economically using an eccentric bending beam or hollow link.\n\nFigure 1 is a cutaway section of a hollow link . This load link is used for thrust or drag and bending at\nthe same time using a bending bridge and a tension or cojpression bridge. Interaction and non-linear response\n\nis not serious if held to minimum since calibration data is stored in the computer used for data reduction.\n\nThe first units sent to the Santa Cruz test base for calibration were constructed using Eastman 910 cement\n\nand waterproofing compound.\n\nFigure 2 shows a transducer returned from the test sight. After removing the outside coating, inspection\nindicated that someone must have grabbed the end of the wire and used it like a yo-yo. It appeared to have\n\nt\n\n\n\'I....\n\nFigure 1.\n\nSectional view of\n\n.\n\nFigure 2.

Part of the problem was assumed to be aged Eastman 910.\nHowever, it is still not certain why the gages came off. Eastman 910 cement is good for certain applica\xc2\xad\ntions, but only in the laboratory under very careful supervision and extreme care.\nFigure 3 shows a more reliable method; i.e., bakelite\n\ngages applied with EPY 400 cement. Transducer installa\xc2\xad\ntions of this kind seem to last much longer with the\nmishandling in the rugged operation which these load\n\n\n-,\n\nI\n\n\nlinks have \t endure. The lead wires still get pulled\n\nto\noff, which \tas yet to be remedied. Perhaps this is why\n\nh\nsome of the Baldwin manufactured load cells are better\nthan many laboratory built load links.\n\nThe other problem has been spring action or deflection\n\nunder load which has led to the use of semiconductor\n\n\nC~\n\nstrain gages.\n\njt\n-\n\n:at\n\nit...\n\nThe output of the semiconductor is kept\n\napproximately the same level as the standard strain\n\ngage, thereby keeping the strain on the element much\n\nlower and reducing our spring effect. This is done to\n\nincrease the natural frequencies of the rocket stand\n\nbeyond the range of the-rocket engine.\n\nThis has produced\n\n\nthe desired structural effects but it has developed a\n\ntemperature problem. If the spring constant is changed\n\n\n-A \n\n\nby a factor of 50 the temperature sensitivity is increased\n\nby a factor of 50. This is a problem, in most of the\n\ncases, does not interfere because duration of the tests\n\nis a second or a second and a half.\n\nIprotected \n\n---\n\nFigure 3. \t\nImproved model of axial \n\nforce transducer.\n\n\nThe transducer is\n\nwith thermal insulation and the ends are made\n\nthermally large, to eliminate the effect of the tempera\xc2\xad\nture change due to external sources. The maximu tem\xc2\xad\nperature change noticed has been 25 to 30 degrees which\n\ngave only one-half percent of full scale. This is not\n\nthe high accuracy needed for most cases, but is the\n\nleast expensive, and is adequate for this particular\n\n\npurpose. Repeatability is of more concern than linearity,\n\nand it has been within one-tenth of one percent for all our transducers. This is quite good. Other factors\n\nare included in the calibration applied load versus output. This is an old method of transducer construc\xc2\xad\ntion which is reliable and ihexpensive because almost any machinist can produce a serviceable unit without\n\nhaving to worry about dimensional tolerance.\n\n\n35\n\n\nIVORIGHOP SESSION I\n.Transducer Problem Areas\n\n\nAt this time we will welcome questions from anyone, on any subject having to do with transducers and we have\nquestions that have been mailed in which will be considered.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIn preparing EPY-400 for laboratory use, have difficulties such as "stringing" been noticed?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe have some of this "stringy" EPY-400 cement, and I haven\'t been able to find any strings in it.\nIn my opinion, the manufacturer\'s method is difficult to use when mixing this cement and I would\nsuggest that you simply take the bag apart and transfer the contents into the container and mix it.\n\nQuestion: \t Does the filler cause trouble?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nThis is definitely true. If we remove the filler we will have about a 300 or 350 degree cement\n\nbecause of the lower modulus of the epoxy. It is generally possible with a little bit of practice\n\nto obtain good EPY-400 installations with a glue thickness approximating 0.001 inch. This is one\n\nreason whj bakelite cement will always maintain some of its popularity. On internal transducer\n\nwork we use a phenolic material which has no filler in it at all.\n\nThere is one other thing we have had some trouble with occasionally and that is quality control\n\nof the cement. If you get some you think is not good, put a little on a specimen and send it back,\n\nand we will see that you get a return supply for it.\n\nThe offer of replacement is appreciated, but what about the gage installations we lose and the\n\ntime that we could be "down" waiting for replacement? Our solution to this problem is to buy\n\nEPY-400 in larger quantities, then re-package and weigh the components. dhen we need cement, it\n\nis mixed in quantities to suit the job, using proportions determined by the weight of components\n\nin each bag. It is used in a warmed condition on a preheated specimen. .This seems to have solved\n\nour problems.\n\nYour question of who is going to replace the money and the time expended in the installation is\n\nIt is the same one that confronts us when the manufacturer of one of our adhesives\n\nmakes a mistake in a lot of\'1000 units.- When this gets out into the field, we have to replace not\n\ncertainly valid.\n\nonly.the cement but the gages. When we go back to our supplier and ask him who is going to replace\n\nthis ten fold amount of gages, he just shakes his head the way I\'m going to shake mine at you.\n\nCost per package of the cement is not worth the effort to get it replaced even though you are\n\nwilling to do it. There are elements of time and paperwork, as far as the user is concerned, that\n\nmake replacement impractical.\n\nIt is more economical to throw it away and get another package.\n\n\nQuestion: \t Would you people say that if there is a possibility that you could buy this material in bulk, you\n\nmight like the arrangement?\n\nAnswer: \t Yes.\n\nQuestion: \t I know that -there are a number of people here who use n6thing but bakelite powder and mix their.\nown. I believe Baldwin also sells the bakelite powder, is that right?\nAnswer: \t\n\nI do not think that we do except in foreign countries, but we certainly could. This group can\n\ndo many things that the average man cannot do. This is one reason we do not push bakelite because\n\nit is necessary to have pressure for the chemical reaction to take place.\n\n\n36\n\nQuestion: \tWe have had a little trouble with the EPY-150.\n\nIt just does not set up unless you put a heat\n\n\nlamp on it.\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nThere was a lot of about 1000 units that went into the field, and we have been unable to deter\xc2\xad\nmine what was wrong with it, but there is no doubt that it wasn\'t right.\n\nYou obtained some of\n\n\nthis bad batch.\n\n\nithra?\n\nQuestion: \tHas anyone found the difference between the EPY-400 and\n\nI am interested in cements for\n\nhigh temperature which are easy to apply and conveniently packaged like EPY-400.\n\nIs Mithra any\n\nbetter?\nAnswer: \t\n\nAs far as I know, they are approximately equivalent cements.\n\nThey are the same two-component\n\n\nsystem, but do not mix well when you try to cross breed them; that is, using liquid MIithra with\n\npowdered EPY-400 or conversely even though they use the same catalyst.\n\nIt seems that Dupont\n\n\nCompany made the catalyst for these systems and has decided that it is not worthwhile manufac\xc2\xad\nturing.\n\nOur supplier Says they are not using this material or they have sufficient quantities\n\n\non hand to cover development of another supply or a substitute material.\nis going to have trouble.\n\nWe have done some work with both of them and we have a feeling that\ntemperatures.\n\nIt does not seem to carbonize quite as rapidly.\n\nOne or the other of us\n\n\nlithra is better for higher\n\nWe mix the entire batch of\n\n\ncement, use what we need and put the rest in the freezer.\n\n\nQuestion: \tAre the NASA pressure transducers as good as indicated?\n\nAnswert \t\n\n%le-have had considerable experience making several hundred transducers ourselves, and by having\n\nmore than a hundred made for us.\n\nAlthough they could be made quite temperature stable, they are\n\n\nkept in temperature controlled cabinets so they experience very small temperature changes.\n\n1e\n\n\nbelieve that they meet specifications to better than 0.10 percent full scale, in a range of 4 psi,\n\nwhich is below the range for which you usually get this degree of accuracy in pressure cells.\n\n\nQuestion: \t Do you feel they are better than Statham\'s precision units?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nWe have not compared them recently.\n\nGenerally speaking, Statham has tried to make units accurate\n\n\nto a tenth of a percent, but .15 percent seems to be their best effort.\n\nThey bid on our design,\n\n\nwhich is rather unusual.\n\nI might mention there is nothing particularly perfected about this design, and we have others\n\nthat would decrease the deflection by a factor of 10.\n\nI do not think there is any real basic\n\n\nlimit to the accuracy.\n\n\nQuestion: \t What is the price of your unit?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nI know we have paid approximately $300 per cell, but I do not know if this includes the whole\n\nsystem.\n\n\nQuestion: \t What is the leak rate of your pressure transducer?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nI am not sure there is a leak-rate problem. When they are used in banks of 100, it is necessary\n\nto hold the pressure while the readout is being made for 100 channels.\n\nAs far as I-know, the\n\n\nleak rate is negligible.\n\n\nQuestion: \tHow do you calibrate these pressure pickups?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nWe have some standards we are using; an Exactal Manometer is more or less a primary standard.\n\n\n37\n\nThe output of this is bucked against the output of the cell and plots an error curve. The curve\n\nyou saw on the slide was essentially a plot of error output against what we consider to be\n\nstandard.\n\nQuestion: \tA number of people who sell load cells have asked me if there is a market for an inexpensive\n\nload cell, opposed to the quarter percent ones which is about all you can buy. Do\n\n2 percent \t\nmost of you people have some use for load cells that would be less accurate and less expensive\n\nto build?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nI think the building of a load cell in that price range is not going to help much because of the\n\nmany different applications.\n\nI was thinking along the line that you wouldn\'t have to have modulus compensation; you wouldn\'t\n\nneed specially heat treated material. Perhaps these load cells could be made in a general con\xc2\xad\nfiguration and the user could just drill a hole to convert to 10,000 pounds instead of 30,000\n\npounds. Is any of this practical from a manufacturer\'s standpoint? It seem to me that if manu\xc2\xad\nfacturers made something that the, user could modify for different ranges, they could do their\n\nown calibrating.\n\nI was thinking of something you could stock, like resistors.\n\n\nI think it could be done. The corporation tried the technique of grading cells as they were\n\nmade. They had an ultra-precision grade which was supposed to be that small portion which for\n\none reason or another happened to be better than the rest. They put this list out and no one\n\nbought the middle class and they suddenly got a tremendous order for the high precision ones.\n\nIt could be impractical from the scheduling standpoint. It ii not a problem of can you make or\n\nsupply one for a low price, but the fact that everyone wants something different makes it diffi\xc2\xad\ncult to stock items economically.\n\nIt seems to me that the main reason for buying the cell is to obtain accuracy. The others can be\n\nmade up in a hurry. The reason you get no one to order the lower grade ones is probably because\n\nthey make their own.\n\n\n38\n\n\nWORShIOP SESSION II\nGeneral Strain Gage Problems\n\n\nStrain Gape Specifications.\n\nMost of you are familiar with\n\nNAS 942 since quite a few of you helped write it.\nAfter trying to use this specification for a little while, it became apparent\n\nthat revisions were necessary. For those of you who are not familiar with NAS 942, it is a specification that\ntold how to test strain gages and determine their characteristics. It was started under the auspices of the\nAerospace Industries Association and tms intended to be a purchase specification for strain gages, but the\npurpose was changed at its very beginning. During the past year or so, it has been in effect as a testing\nstandard.\nIn its present form it attempts to set forth the standards for minimum qualification test data that the manu\xc2\xad\nfacturers of strain gages are required to supply. It specifies how tile test data is to be obtained, the\n\nformat in which it should be presented and the test procedures and instrumentation accuracies that should be\n\nused in obtaining the data. Once we started to apply the specification, some of the problems with it became\n\nreadily apparent. in November, 1960 there was a meeting at the Bureau of Standards on strain gage evaluation\n\nwhich was attended by strain gage manufacturers, representatives of various government agencies and represen\xc2\xad\ntatives from the Aerospace Industries Association.\nseveral things having to do with gage evaluation.\n\n\nAt this meeting there was considerable discussion on\n\n\nOne of the things discussed was NAS 942 and some possible revisions that should be made. Several things were\n\nsuggested that probably will be attempted. One of these was to eliminate the requirement for testing all\n\ngage types according to the specification. This could be accomplished in two or three different ways. For\n\nexample, by grouping gages up into different types, or by grouping gages into various temperature spans. It\n\nwas proposed that some of the measurements, for example, change in gage factor as a function of temperature\n\ncould be made on a more qualitative basis. It requires absolute measurement of gage factor at each tempera\xc2\xad\nture and this data is not too useful; at least it is not required. The specification will probably be changed\n\nfrom its present form requiring steady state measurements to allow certain types of transient measurements and\n\nthe use of automatic plotting equipment. Originally there were no requirements for the use of this equipment\n\nbecause people felt that someone could develop the world\'s best strain gage in a "garage shop", and he would\n\nbe penalized if required to buy a bunch of fancy equipment to evaluate his product. On the other hand,\'\n\nestablished straih gage manufacturers could be inconvenienced or put out of business by the amount of data\n\nreduction if they cannot use automatic plotters.\n\nThe drift specification probably will be changed. It has been the experience of several people that require\xc2\xad\nments now set forth are impractical and not too useful. Most of the drift occurs during the first portion\n\nof gage heating and this is more critical than spelled out in the procedure. We may specify drift rather\n\nthan drift rate. There have been several proposals in regard to how thermal output and hysteresis should\n\nbe measured. One proposal was that the output should be recorded as a slope plus a deviation curve in order\n\nto get the required resolution with the results. It was also suggested that d simple check of self generated\n\nelectrical output might be included by removing bridge exitation and measuring residual signal. This is a\n\nfunction of the installation, but it would be an indication of what can be expected in your own testing.\n\nThe leakage resistance tests could be automated to allow X-Y plots of leakage resistance versus temperature,\n\npossibly under\'low speed transient conditions. A requirement for measuring transverse sensitivity has been\n\nproposed for addition to the specification. Other portions of the specification are to be left unchanged\n\nsuch as requirements for fatigue testing and information on the gage installation procedure and previous\n\n\n39\n\n\nhistory of the gage, physical description, etc.\nspecimens to be tested be specified.\n\nIt has been strongly suggested that a required number of\n\n\nBetween 4 and 6 of each type should survive the test program, rather\n\n\nthan leaving the number up to the manufacturer.\n\nSince this meeting the ARTC Conittee of the Aerospace Industries Association has authorized revision of\nNAS 942 and the project set in motion. At the ARTC meeting, it was again requested that NAS 942 be made\na purchase specification. The first step is a questionnaire to Aircraft Industries Association members,\n\nvarious governmental agencies and load cell manufacturers to determine what the characteristics of a stan\xc2\xad\ndard family of strain gages ought to be.\n\nThis questionnaire by necessity is incomplete.\n\nConsidering the\n\n\npossible parameters and combinations of parameters, you end up with a voluminous questionnaire.\n\nI tried\n\n\nto cover what appeared to be the main points and limit responses to require them to talk about a particular\n\ngage that they think would best fit their needs. We will put these responses together and try to generate\n\na characteristic family from them. Just how successful this proposal will be, I do not know. Se hope to\nhave this completed by February 1962.\n\nQuestion: \t The requirements for flight testing are much different than requirements for laboratory struc\xc2\xad\ntural testing.\nAnswer: \t\n\nAre there to be two separate specifications for this?\n\n\nThere will be one response per company division; include your more strenuous requirements. If\nyou decide that grading is a good idea, it could be possible that for certain applicaiions flight\ntest may need a premium grade strain gage and the laboratory people might need something else.\nThe specification as it is now written, is sectioned. Section I is scope; Section 2 is applicable\ndocuments. The specifications as referred to the specific company purchase documents. The only\nthing that is covered now is how to measure physical quantities. It does not say anything about\nwhat they should be.\n\nQuestion: \t Is the revision trying to say what they should be?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nYes, to set minimum requirement.\n\n\nQuestion: \tIsn\'t this achieved automatically when grading is included?\n\nAnswer: \t Not necessarily.\n\nManufacturers may feel that they have to produce different grades. From the\nstandpoint of buying a reasonably priced strain gage in large quantities for high volume work,\nthe accuracy requirements are not too high. If the minimum requirement is high enough to meet\n50 percent of the required work, then the other 50 percent has to pay the premium.\n\nQuestion: \tDoes any document get down to specifying by type, because then you are specifying a manufacturer\'s\n\ntype?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe following are proposed definitions for these various grades. The top grade would be a gage\nfor which strict quality control is required and it would be subjected to all of the qualifica\xc2\xad\ntion tests that are presently required in NAS 942. The second grade would come with essentially\nthe information that you get now, the nominal gage factor and the resistance, and if possible,\nthe temperature cofficient for lot number. A third grade of gage would be for people who want\nsomething that gives a strain indication, and who do not require a gage factor.\n\nQuestion: \tWhen this is done, don\'t you think the manufacturer ought to say that this is a grade A and this\n\nis grade B?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nI do not know exactly what the manufacturers have in mind.\n\nBaldwin has been very good about\n\n\nhelping with the specification. They have been running qualification tests under the existing\n\n\n40\n\nspecification and have a pretty good feel now for what is involved.\n\nOne thing that has caused\n\n\nsome consternation is that the definition of the word "type", the gage type.\n\nI think that for\n\n\nthe most of our purposes, take the flat grid bakelite gages and perhaps call this a type. Manu\xc2\xad\nfacturers want to evaluate this type of gage, say this is typical of this line that everything\n\nwill be this good or better.\n\nQuestion: \tHow do you settle a case where the strain gage installation is outside of standard procedures?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nWe try to determine the maximum limit of endurance as far as curing them out.\n\nWe then use that\n\n\ncure to evaluate our gages.\n\nIt makes a great deal of difference what adhesives we use and what\ncures we use. PAS 942 calls out that manufacturers specify the adhesives, cure cycle, handling\n\nand installation procedures in great detail. If you use the manufacturers\' methods, results\n\nshould be similar. This is one thing that you do not get now.\nor no indication as to how they were obtained.\n\n\nWe get the results, but little\n\n\nThere is another problem that enters in here. We have the same trouble with strain gages that\n\nyou mentioned with transducers. Purchasing people in various aircraft companies have rules that\n\nthey operate by. With so many people getting into the strain gage business, if purchasing people\n\nbuy the lowest price item, you may lose control over what you put on your airplane or test struc\xc2\xad\nture. This specification was intended to alleviate this problem.\n\nAs an example of this, we received some new gages that vere supposed to solve all our problems,\nbut no gage factor on the package. So we called the manufacturer and asked for the gage factor.\nHe said I do not know; I do not have any way to measure it.\n\nI\'ll give you the name of the guy\ndown the street where I bought the material and maybe he can tell you.\nQuestion: \tThe constant stress beam for fatigue has been shown photoelastically to be otherwise. In the\n\ninterest of accuracy and correctness, shouldn\'t WAS 942 use a theoretically correct specimen\n\nfor the fatigue tests?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nDefinitions and fundamentals should be compatible and in complete agreement with basic fundamen\xc2\xad\ntals of theoretical and applied mechanics. However, when it comes to evaluating competitive pro\xc2\xad\nducts, the evaluation is not required to be completely and one hundred percent compatibly oriented\n\nwith theoretical and applied mechanics to obtain the last "gnats eyebrow"\ntechniques. The prinicpal requirement in.this case is for all evaluation\nin precisely the same manner for comparative purposes. If we control the\nthey are theoretically correct or not, we will still have the comparative\n\nof refinement in our\n\ntests to be conducted\n\nconditions, whether\n\ndata that ieare looking\n\n\nfor. WAS 942 is oriented to give a practical approach to comparative testing and establish\n\ntechniques whereby we are controlling the testing conditions and environment for comparative data.\n\nThere is more latitude possible when setting up a performance specification than in setting up\n\nbasic definitions\'\n\nStrain Gage Problems. \t le will move into the area of general discussion and will be happy to have questions\non any of the subjects. We have received questions on waterproofing materials for\ncryqgenic and high temperatureS. \'If omeofie will volunteer information in either area, we would all like to\nhear it.\nQuestion: \tWe have obtained pretty decent strain gage data from tests using liquid nitrogen, but have been\n\nunsuccessful in preventing atmospheric moisture from degrading the installation during warm-up to\n\nambient temperature. The two or three materials tried have been failures even though liquid\n\nnitrogen does not appear to affect the installations.\n\n41\n\n\nCan this be averted?\n\n\nAnswer-\t\n\nWhile working at cryogenic temperatures with liquid nitrogen, we conducted a number of immersion\ntests alloting frost to form on warm up. le encountered the same phenomenon and solved the problem\nin the nanner shown in the Douglas Seven Step Installation Technique that appeared in our Proceed\xc2\xad\nings of the 1959 Seattle meeting. The lead wire electrical connection is made well in on the gage.\nE\nUsing some \tPY-41X or other strain gage adhesive, work some of it over and around the end of the\n\nwire and connection to anchor the lead. This sealing attachment provides a mechanical bond and\n\nseals the wire end to prevent a "wicking" action. Closing off this end of the system in itself\n\ngives a very effective moisture seal for rather severe conditions, even for repeated immersion in\n\nliquid nitrogen.\n\nFurther precautions for mechanical handling were also described where we used some PRC products\nor equivalent. There are a number of products that have worked fairly well and should be applied\n\nlightly. Churchill Chemical Company 3CI300 worked quite well. There are a number of these rubber\xc2\xad\nlike materials that are compatible with the epoxy and are rather easy to use. The key to the whole\n\nthing is closing off the wires in a satisfactory manner.\n\n\nQuestion: \t Can you use Epon?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nThis method is applicable to any of the adhesives. It works well with EPY-400, Epon VIII, Epon VI,\n\nor any similar adhesive for high temperature work. It also works satisfactorily with the bondable\n\ntype teflon wires.\n\n\nQuestion: \tWe have tried to do the very same thing, but the EPY-40\nAnswer: \t\n\nbond tracked after several cycles.\n\n\nAn excessive quantity of adhesive will tend to crack due to the mass present and its own thermal\n\nexpansion properties resulting in a progressive failure. Other materials may be acceptable. One\nof the newer synthetic rubbers such as Viton B which is being used in high temperature areas could\nbe used. They seem to be promising for higher temperature moisture proofing. If they are as\ncompatible with other temperature extremes as they are with the 600 to 700\xc2\xb0F environments they are\nused for, then they may be very serviceable for cryogenic temperatures until you get into problems\nfrom direct contact with liquid hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nQuestion: \tAre these some things that come in tubes?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nNo. Liquid Viton is similar to liquid neoprene. It is soluble in methylisobutyl ketone (MIBK)\n\nuntil final cure at 6000F. Vitons are high temperature synthetic rubbers. They appear to be\n\ngood *ealants which are unaffected by other organic liquids which are encountered in the aircraft\n\nindustry, including a lot of the hydraulic fluids, dire manufacturers are coming out with high\ntemperature cables using Viton jacketing with a higher service temperature than teflon.\n\n\nQuestion: \tHow does one improve adhesive action of Eastman 910?\n\nAnswer: \t\n\nToo many people have had trouble uith it. .e have had our troubles, although we use it extensively.\nThere is one thing that we have to do, and that is buff the back of the gage. If you do not, you\nnight as well not use it at all, especially on bakelite gages. One of the techniques for buffing\n\nthe back of the gages to remove the gloss, is to use the pencil style, refillable fiber glass\n\ntypewriter erasers. They are very handy. You do not use Eastman 910 with wire gages in paper\n\nmatrix.\n\n\nQuestion: \t Do you use it on epoxy backed gages?\nAnswer; \t\n\nWe can and do, but do not use many epoxy gages.\n\n\n42\n\nQuestion:\n\nHave the data presented at the last meeting for Curvature Error Strain been verified?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIWe had an instrumented test part for use on an airplane with the gages laid on 5/8 inch diameter\nrod wjith the end of the rod enlarged to accept a bearing. The gages were on the cylindrical sec\xc2\xad\ntion and temperature error was about 10 times greater than the formula would predict.\n\nIn order\n\nto determine the cause of t is effect, wie\nused simple specimens and checked the formula with good\nagreement. Temperature distribution \'seemed to be the trouble.\nIle\ncured the imediate problem\nby installing the gages on machined flats.\nI want to point out the effect of thermal masses on some parts can develop misleading data.\n\nIf\n\ngages are to be applied. on a section near some thermal mass, significant errors are still possible\neven tinder stable te.nperdture conditions. Variable temperature conditions are even worse.\nQuestion:\n\nHas, anyone using the weldable type gages experienced a transverse buckling phenomena?\n\nAnswer:\n\nTo increase the performance of preirounted, weldable gages in compressive strain fields, apply a\nbondable teflon terminal on top of the gage and over the grid. This will stiffen the assembly\nfor transverse buckling, provide mechanical and thermal protection and serve as an insulated point\nto attach a thermocouple for thermocouple compensation of the strain gage circuit. This method\nwill permit the use of thinner shim stock for less stiffening effect and better installations. If\nyou make your own assemblies, cut the piece large enough to cover the grid of the gage and cement\nit in position at the time strain gages are applied to the shim stock tab. In effect, this applies\na geometric stiffening effect to inhibit transverse buckling effect obtained at higher compressive\nstrain levels without the undesirable effect of localized buckling in the gage. Geometric mass\nand stiffening are added without adding strength to the total assembly because added material\nmodulus is insignificant compared to the rest of the assembly.\n\nQuestion:\n\nhy haven\'t strain gage manufacturers provided high temperature strain gages with one large and\none standard tab for use in the single gage three wire system?\n\nAnsw-er:\n\nI do not think it has been mentioned before and it seems to be a very good idea0\nHigh temperature gages made with one tab much wider than the other to accept the two wires attached\nat the same point would be convenient and helpful. We have found that installations give different\noutputs from temperature variation because of different lead attachment locations.\nI think that tabs on the strippable back gages could be enlarged in many respects, either lengthened\nor widened. There seems to be space between the tabs which could be used for enlarging the tabs.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy not make both tabs larger, then you do not have to worry about an irregular installation?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThis could increase the gage size to the point you %fould be unable to place the gage in the desired\nlocation.\n\n43\n\n\nWESTERN REGIONAL STRAIN GAGE C01ITT .RE\n\nJack Tar Hotel, San Francisco, California\nFlay 11 and 12, 1961\nThursday, May 11\n\nPLANT TOURS\n\nLockheed Missile and Space Division\nBriefing Session\nRecess\nTour of Lockheed Laboratories\nLuncheon\nAmes Research Center\n\nBriefing Session\n\nTour of Ames Laboratories\n\n5th Anniversaiy Dinner\n\n\nFriday, May 12\n\nTECINICAL SESSIONS\n\nChairman\'s Convening Statements\n\nWard B.

Hines\n\nStaff Engineer\n\nBaldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation\n\nElectronics and Instrumentation Division\n\nGENERAL:\n\nThe term Stress-Strain Gage is used to describe a unique bonded resistance strain gage whose change in resis\xc2\xad\ntance under applied strain can, at the option of the user, be made proportional to either the strain or to\n\nthe stress in the direction of the principal gage axis. Figure 1 shows a typical configuration of an etched\n\nfoil type of Stress-Strain Gage. Basically, this gage consists of two single uniaxial strain sensing elements\n\nof different resistance values oriented at 900 to each other. The two elements have one common connection\n\nso that only three lead connections are available. Either of the two elements can be selected and observed\n\nindependently or the two elemepts can be read together,\n\ndepending upon which two of the three gage terminals\n\nare connected to the readout instrument. Thus, by con\xc2\xad\nnection to Terminals T and T3 , Element 1 only is in\n\nthe measuring circuit and the observed readings are\n\n\na\n\n\nElement I\n\nproportional to strain in a manner similar to any con-\n\nventional single element strain gage. Connection to\n\nTerminals T1 and T2 places both Elements 1 and 2, in\n\n\n~ings\n\nseries, in the measuring circuit and the observed read\xc2\xad\nare a function of \t the strains In both elements.\n\nThis latter hookup, through proper design of the gage\n\n\nElement 2\n\n\ngeometry and the resistance ratio between the two\n\nelements, can be made to produce observed readings that\n\nare proportional to the stress along the major gage axis.\n\nMeasurement need not be limited to either strain or\n\nT2\n\nT1\n\nT3\n\na\nFigure 1\n\nTypical Stress-Strain Gage\nConfiguration in Etched\nFoil Construction \t\n\nstress alone. By the use of three lead wires and suit\xc2\xad\nable switching arrangements, both strain and stress\nalong the principal gage axis can be obtained. In\naddition, by connection to Terminals T2 and T , it is\npossible to obtain strain readings from Element 2 only,\nalthough limitations on the resistance of this element\n(approximately 1/3 that of Element 1) my make it unsuit\xc2\xad\nable for use with some instrumentation.\n\n\nGAGE THEORY\n\nSTRESS \t\nThe theory of the bonded resistance stress gage, as applied to both T and V configurations and including\xc2\xad\n1. 2\nrigid proofs, has been thoroughly explained in published literature.\n2 The following is a brief\n\ndescription intended only to reveal the essential characteristics required in a stress gage.\n\nLet the following symbols apply to the combination of gage Elements 1 and 2 as shown in Figure I (leads\n\nconnected to Terminals T 1 and T2).\n\nFa\n\n= \t Strain sensitivity of the combination of gage elements for uniaxial strain along axis a-a\n\nfor zero transverse strain.\n\nNOTE:\n\nOhms/ohn/in/in.\n\nSuperscript numbers refer to references at \t\nend of discussion.\n\n48\n\n\nFn\n\nn\n\nStrain sensitivity of the combination of gage elements for uniaxial strain along axis\n\nn-n, normal to a-a, for zero longitudinal strain along a-a.

The first condition is that when da = 0, then\n= 0, which means that the change in\ngage resistance must be independent of the transverse stress, dn The second condition is that when\nthen . = a F , which means that the change in gage resistance must be proportional to the stress,\nda, applied along t e a-a axis. If these two conditions are met, the gage will respond only to the stress\napplied in the direction of the principal gage axis, a-a.\ndn\n\nApplying the first condition to Equation 8 gives\n\nAR\n\nks\n\nn "a\n\n=\n\nR\n\nE\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\n=1\n\n-\n\nfrom which\n\nks\n\no.\n\n(10)\n\n\nApplying the second condition to Equation 8 gives\n\ndFd\n\n\nAR\nR\n\n=\n\nEa\n\n)\n\na\n\n(11)\n\nS.,\n\nfrom which\n\nF\n\nF\n\n(1\n\n(12)\n\n0ks)\n\n-\n\nEquation 10 shows that a stress gage, in order to have a change in resistance proportional only to applied\nstress, must simply have a transverse sensitivity coefficient equal to the Poisson\'s ratio of the material\non which it is bonded.\n\nEquation 12 shows how the stress gage factor, Fs, is related to the other gage\n\nconstants.. Note that F,\n\nthe strain sensitivity for uniaxial strain, is not the same as the conventional\n\ngage factor of a simple single element gage.\n\n.\n\n-\n\nIn the stress-strain gage configuration shown in Figure 1, Element I is the principal strain measuring por\xc2\xad\ntion of the sensing grid.\nconnected in series.\n\nElement 2 provides the necessary transverse sensitivity when the two elements are\n\n\nThe amount of transverse sensitivity introduced by Element 2, and hence the transverse\n\n\nsensitivity coefficient of the gage as a whole, my be controlled through the ratio of the resistance of\n\nElement 2 to Element 1.\n\nIf the individual elements were perfect uniaxial strain measuring devices, then the\n\n\nratio would be\n\nR2\n\nks\n\n=\n\no\n\nR1\nThis ratio is only approximate, however, because each individual element has a small but measureable trans\xc2\xad\nverse sensitivity coefficient of its own.\n\nCorrection of the approximate resistance ratio can he made through\n\n\nactual calibration or by computation from the known characteristics of the individual elements.\n\nUsing the resistance ratio as a guide, the following table shows some possible combinations of gage resistance\n\nvalues for po\n\n= \n\n\n0.30.\n\n\n5o\n\nCase\n\nR1\n\nR2\n\n1\n2\n\n120\n92.5\n\n3\n4\n\n350\n269\n\n36\n27.5\n105\n81\n\nR1 + R 2\n156\n120\n455\n350\n\nIt appears that cases 1 and 3, in which the resistance of the single strain measuring element, R, conforms\n\nto conventional strain gage resistance values, are the more desirable. In general, instrumentation systems\n\nwill accomodate an increase in gage resistance over the common values better than a decrease. In addition,\n\nan increase in gage resistance will reduce extraneous effects, such as those caused by lead wire resistance.\n\nThe "stress gage factor", Fs . should not be confused with the\n\nstrain gage factor \'\n supplied with the more\n\nt\n\nconventional single element or multiple element rosette type strain gages. Although both have the same dimen\xc2\xad\nsional units, ohms/ohm/in./in., they actually relate to different quantities. The "strain gage factor" is\n\nthe proportionality constant relating the unit change of resistance of a strain gage to the total axial mechan\xc2\xad\nical strain to which it is subjected. In contrast, the "stress gage factor" is the proportionality constant\n\nrelating the unit change in resistance of a stress gage to da/E, where da is the stress along the gage axis\n\nand E is the modulus of elasticity of the material to which it is bonded. dS/E is, of course, a strain, but\n\nis not the total mechanical strain except under very special conditions. A stress gage may be regarded as\n\nan automatic computer that solves the general stress-strain equations, rejects the axial component of strain\n\ndue to stress in a transverse direction, and responds only to that component of strain produced by the stress\n\nin the axial direction. The fundamental relationship, then, for interpreting the result of a stress gage\n\nmeasurement is\n\nCa\n\nAR\n\nE\n\nR\n\n1\n\nr5\n\nERRORS FROM MIISMATCH OF TRANSVERSE SEMS1TIVITY COEFFICIENT TO POISSON\'S RATIO:\nIdeally, the transverse sensitivity coefficient, ks , of a stress gage should be exactly equal to Poisson\'s\n\nratio, I, of the material to which the gage is bonded. This precise condition will seldom be obtained in\n\nactual practice, however, because o! the wide range of Poisson\'s \'atios exhibited by common structural mater\xc2\xad\nials, the lack of accurate data conberning the exact.value of Poisson\'s ratio for the particular condition\n\nof the test specimen material, and because of normal gage manufacturing tolerances.\n\nconsider the equation for the response of\n\nTo determine the reading error caused by a mismatch of ks and i\',\na stress gage when exposed to a general stress field as already derived in Equation 8.\n\nLR= [{\na\nE Ia\n\nR\n\n(l - pk)\n5\n\n+ a,( k-L\nna sjj\n\n1\n\n(8)\n\nThe apparent stress, (da)c, obtained from the change in resistance given in Equation 8 and from the stress\n\ngage factor given with the gages will be, from Equation 11,\n\nE\n(4)\n\n=\n\nAR\nx -R\n\n,\nEfa\n -kp\nFs X L- a 1 -- s )+o\n\nk\n\nFn\n\nFa\n\nj[ a\n\n(I\n\n-lks)\n\n+\n\n6\n\nn\n\n(ksc - p]\n\n(13)\n51\n\nThe true stress is, of course, da.\ne\n\n- (Ca)c -\n\nThe error, e, in the calculated stress is\n\n\n\'a\n\n62\n\n\nd8\n\nF 26\n\nd\n\n\n[dca\n\nk5\n\n-\n\n+ Cdk\n\n(14)\n\njO]\n\n-\n\ns6\n\n\na\nF\nFs\n\n(\n\n-\n\ngic_) +\n\ne\n (k\na\n\n\n__\n\np)\n\n1\n\nBut, from Equation 12.\n\nF\nFsaFa 1--pok s\n\n(15)\n\nThen, by substituting the above for Fa in Equation 14,\n\na\n\n\n0a\n\n[(1-k) +\n\n(31L\n\n(-p 0 k5 )\n\n\n1-ok\n\ns\n\nk\n\n\' +r\n-g)\n\na\n\nks.I1)\n\n(16)\n\n\n1-iok s\n\nSince o\n\nks* the condition under which F was established, the error expression can be further simplified to\n\n\ne\n\nIc + ~)(\nika2\n1-k \n\ns\n\n5\n\ng\n\n(17)\n\n7\n\nEquation 17, then, is the general expression for the error in a stress gage reading caused by misath of k\n\ns\n\n\nto P.

Only infrequently is its value given beyond two significant figures, the probable accuracy is\n\nalmost never mentioned, and the method of determination is rarely described. This general indeterminate\n\nnature of the value of Poisson\'s ratio should be recognized when applying stress gages and in solving stress\xc2\xad\nstrain relationships, although it is probably of lesser importance in the latter case.\n\nTable I lists values for Poisson\'s ratio obtained front various sources, including handbooks and manufacturer\'s\n\nliterature.\n\nThe accuracies of the listed values are unknown and none have been verified.

It is the\nquestion of \t\nwhether or not the gages were properly used\n\nand the results correctly interpreted that raises doubt\n\nconcerning the validity and accuracy of much of the\n\npublished data.\n\nThe conventional method of determining Poisson\'s ratio\n\nwith bonded resistance strain gages is by measurement\n\nof axial and transverse strains on a standard tensile\n\ntest specimen, either flat or round type, under applied\n\nload. Conventional single element strain gages or\n\n0\ndouble element 90 X gages, not stress gages, should be\n\nused. The best arrangement of gages is that of two\n\n\naxial gages positioned directly opposite each other 6n\n\na flat specimen or diametrically opposite on a round\n\n\nspecimen, and two circumferential or transverse gages\n\nalso positioned directly opposite each other. Readings\n\nof each pair of similarly positioned gages are averaged\n\nto cancel the bending strains always present in tensile\n\nspecimens and which, incidentally, can be quite substantial in magnitude. The ratio of the transverse or\n\ncircumferential gage readings to the axial gage readings,- properly corrected for the transverse sensitivity\n\ncoefficient of the particular gages, is Poisson\'s ratio. The need for making a correction based on the trans\xc2\xad\nverse sensitivity %oefficient is emphasized because it is the operation most likely to be neglected or over\xc2\xad\nlooked.\n\nSimple formulas for applying a correction for transverse sensitivity to two similar gages positioned at\n\n3\n\nright angles to each other have been published many years ago.\n These formulas are\n\nzIEl (1-p ok) (a \n\n=\n(lj 0 )~, cl-ke G2)\n\n\n(2\n\n(22)\n\n\nl~2\n\n1-k2\n\n\nC2\n\nC(-ji k) (ec -ks1 )\n2\n0\n\n(23)\n\n\n,\n\n2\n\n\n1-k\n\nwhere a. and es are the apparent strains given by the gages along aI and a2 axes respectively based on\n\n1\n2\nthe manufacturer\'s gage factor, Fc , as given with each package of gages, and where A0 is Poisson\'s ratio\n\n56\n\nof the bar on which the gages were originally calibrated to determine FC . The symbol k designates the\n\ntransverse sensitivity coefficient of the single element gages. Then by definition and from the above two\n\nequations,\n\n\np\n\ne 2\n\n(ce2-kei)\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_\n\nCI\n\n(cl-kec\n\n(24)\n\n2)\n\nEquation 24 is the proper formula for determination of Poisson\'s ratio from strain gage readings taken from\n\naxially and transversely positioned gages on tensile specimens. Note that in the general correction Equations\n\n22 and 23, the algebraic sign of &el and .,9 positive for tensile strains and negative for compressive\n\nis\nstrains. The same sign convention must also be followed in the special case, Equation 24, so that the sign\n\nof p actually is negative, although the negative sign is normally used only in formulas applying 11.\n\nThe magnitude of the error in the determination of Poisson\'s ratio caused by neglecting the correction for\n\ntransverse sensitivity is of some interest. Some strain gages have very small transverse sensitivity coeffi\xc2\xad\ncients and the correction may be omitted if the ultimate in accuracy is not required.

Out of town\ntests are scheduled in government and contractors facilities on a more or less regular basis. With the\nexception of the shock tubes and the ballistics ranges we are running force tests in an average of about a\ndozen research facilities.\n\nThe Boeing Wind Tunnel Unit has some 90 multi-component internal sting balances currently in active schedul\xc2\xad\ning. These designs represent many different approaches based on analysis and experience which are in general,\ntailored to the testing requirements. The identification charts of Supplement I show most of our balances\ngraphically associated with the facility and type of vehicle for which they were designed. It is our philo\xc2\xad\nsophy to utilize those concepts of measurement which seen to best suit the situation, remembering that a\nsuccessful balance represents many compromises. Thus the balances that Boeing develops show a high degree\nof variation in appearance and in the general principles utilized.\n\nThe development of multi-component strain gage balances for our wind tunnel tests falls in three separate\n\ncategories:\n\n1. \t\nInternal balance requirements based on long range forecasting for specific types of aircraft\n\ntests (i.e., missiles, airplanes, boost glide, etc.).\n\n2. \t\nRequirements for internal balances based on specific tests for specific model configurations.\n\n3. \t\nRequirements for special purpose balances for control surfaces, fins, nacelles, etc. for specific\n\nmodel configurations.\n\nThe first of these categories permits the most sophisticated analytical and fabrication techniques in that\n\nthe long lead time (six months to a year) is anticipated. The second and third categories permit only one\n\nto four months of development and therefore, the most simplifiedtechniques are justified.\n\nAll of our designs reflect not only the testing requirements but the facilities at our disposal for design,\n\nfabrication,-heat treating, gaging, calibration and data reduction. We are fortunate in the emphasis that\n\nBoeing places on the value of Wind Tunnel testing which results in priority usage of existing company facil\xc2\xad\nities and a cooperative outlook in helping us get the tools and manpower required to do the job right; High\n\nspeed digital computing facilities are available to aid us in programed computations for balance design\n\ncriteria, stress analysis for generalized balance configurations, preparations of tables of section proper\xc2\xad\nties, force calibration data reduction, and wind tunnel test data reduction. Special machinery for the fabri\xc2\xad\ncation of balances, such as Eleroda and Japax electric discharge milling equipment has been installed in our\n\nbalance development machine shop. This permits the construction of balance configurations, otherwise impos\xc2\xad\nsible, so that maximum utilization of material and space.may be realized. Advantage is taken of our high\n\nquality metallurgical facilities and personnel at Boeing. Salt bath martempering is used on all of our steel\n\nbalances with the advantages of extremely low warpage and surface scale during heat treat. This permits heat\n\ntreating after finishing most of the surfaces on the balances.\n\nBecause of the size of the investment and cost of testing time it is of prime importance that the balance\n\ndesigns should reflect strong emphasis on dependability, reliability and utility. Considerable effort is\n\n60\n\nmade to ninimize sources of random and unpredictable errors such as temperature effects and mechanical hyster\xc2\xad\nesis. However, because of our ability to handle compensatable errors, such as interactions, we are only\n\nsecondarily interested in minimizing them and then not at the expense of reliability. This is not to say that\n\nour design approach sacrifices accuracy but definitely emphasizes reliability because of the fine support\n\nthat we have for calibration and data reduction.\n\nLikewise, another design aim is to minimize the amount of compensation apparatus and extra equipment associated\ndirectly with the balance and model so that we may reduce the sources of human and mechanical error. This,\ntoo, has contributed to our reliance on rather sophisticated laboratory calibration techniques and off line\ndigital data reduction programs for compensating predictable errors mathematically.\nThis philosophy has led us toward one piece balance designs whose outputs are directly proportional to the\ncomponents to be measured. Some of our balance development techniques will be discussed in the following text.\n\n1. \t\n\nStress Cancellation rioment Transfer Technique\n\nThe limited space available for the construction of\n\ninternal balances poses especially severe problems in\nthe design of the axial force element because of the other loads which must be supported, but not measured\nby this element. One of the problems is that the axial force element is that part of the balance structure\nwhich is characteristically, weakest to bending moments. Hence, in most of our compact (high loads-small\nspace) designs the axial force element is located at the station about which moments are to be reduced,\nsince statistically the maximum bending moments about that point are lowest (Figure la).\n"d"\nh,/Jdes\n\nS\n++\n\nEnvelope of maximum\ngn bending moments\nCenter of pressure\ncorresponding to\ntest condition Y\'\n\nIra)\n\nMin. design\n\nbending moment \t\n\nSupport member\n\ntest,\n\n\ncondition\n\nIb"\nctest\nobending\n\nNOTE\nSlope of the\nmoment curves is\nproportional to the\napplied force (e.g.\nintegrated pressure)\n\nStation corresponding\nto the min. design\nmoment.\n\nN\nMoment center\n\n_rm7\n\nAxial force \t\nmeasuring element\n\nFigure 1.\n\n61\n\nITransverse elemeents\nreeasuring loads\n\nLOAD SYSTEM\n\n"\n\nA\n\n(2b)\n\nNIx-\n\nFREE BODY\n\nB\n\nDIAGRAM;\n\n__.______-.\n_\n\niRfZNK~)-\n\n"_"\n\n7_- 7.\n\n_____\n\nN\xc2\xad\n\n_ _7\n\n_\n\nR =N"\n\n""\n\n(20)\n\nOVERALL SENDING\n\nMOMENT(7m) STRESS\nDIAGRAM:\n\n-\n\nN\nSatsfyng only\n\nt\n\n_<os\n\n-S.\n,s.\n-C1\n\nM\n-\n\nL\n\n+S,\n\nt\n\n+SN\n+jCz\n\n-s .. -sM;\n\nFigure 2.\n\nA\n\n-(Ni)f\n\n(-S\n\n(2d)\nINTERNAL FORGE\nREACTION (Rn) STRESS\nDIAGRAM:\n\nNORMAL FORCE\nSTRESS CANCELLATION\n\nS\n\notlsfylng\n\nonly\n\n=R x(\n\n-\n\n-si\n\nNORMAL FORCE\nSTRESS CANCELLATION\n\nB\n\n.\n\nB\n\n1-\n\nFigure 3.\n\nx\n\nIn order to measure moments about the moment center with our typical five component cage which is located\n\nremotely from the moment center (Figure lb), it has been necessary to transfer moments from the center of\n\nthe cageeither electrically through an anolog device or mthematically. The subject of the discussion in\n\nSupplement 2 is a parallel member cage on which advantage is taken of the fact that two sources of normal\nforce (or side force) stress due to force applied at the moment center tend to Cancel. (See Figure 2.)\n\nPoints are picked on the structure at which the normal force stresses are zero. Hence, pitching moment\n\ngages may be handily mounted there, which are outside of the influence of the normal force; thus, they read\n\nmoments about the moment center (see Figure 3) regardless of the magnitude of the normal force.\n\nThis technique has been developed for use in two component (normal force and pitching moment) and five com\xc2\xad\nponent cages (normal and side forces, pitching, yawing, and rolling moments) of which our balances 3124A\nand 6132A and B (Figures 4 and 5. respectively) are typical examples. The analysis and mathematics of the\ndesign, which are given in Supplement 2, have been programed for use in selecting balance configurations.\n\nFinal stress analyses of the selected configurations, which have also been digitally programed, appear in\n\nSupplement 3.\n\n2. \t\nHigh Frequencv .Response Balances for Hypervelooitv Hotshot Testing\n\nExtremely high Mach numbers and\n\ntemperatures may be achieved for\nvery short time durations in our "Hotshot" (arc discharge, hypervelocity) wind tunnels. Aerodynamic force\nbalance designs for these facilities, otherwise enhanced by low q\'s and the relatively high temperature\ninertia of the model - balance structure, are fraught with instrument dynamics problems associated with the\n\nshort time duration of the aerodynamic loads to be measured.\n\nThe technique of inertia compensating a force balance with accelerometer outputs can, if analysis is applied\n\nrigorously, provide true aerodynamic loads data.\n\nHowever, at the Boeing Hotshot facilities we have utilized\n\n\nanother approach:\n\nThe output of the force transducer (essentially an undamped system) is comprised of aerodynamic loads and\n\ninertia loads. In order to filter out the inertia loads, either by curve fairing or with electronic filters,\n\nit is necessary to separate the structural natural frequencies from the frequency components of the aero\xc2\xad\ndynamic forcing function by as large an order as possible. This approach minimizes the phase shift and\n\namplitude distortion to the relativelylower aerodynamic frequenciesin low pass electronic filters,-or\n\npermits accurate curve fairing through the relatively higher inertial frequencies when using unfiltered\ntraces.\n\nThe advantages of this approach are the comparatively simple model installation and data handling procedures.\nIowever, the problems in designing a model support system, including the support base, angle sector, sting.\nand internal balance, with sufficiently high natural frequencies are considerable. To these ends we have\n\nprogrammed sting frequency and amplitude parameters for digital computation in selecting suitable sting con\xc2\xad\nfigurations.\n\nThe balance shown in Figures 6, 7 and 8 is a design which emphasizes high structural natural frequencies;\n\nhence, high response rates for the dynamic forcing functions which must be measured by the balance. Addi\xc2\xad\ntional advantages are achieved by the compactness of the design and the relatively simple procedure required\n\nto fabricate this balance from one piece of metal. One piece construction eliminates problems caused by\n\nrelative motions in discontinuous joints and the resulting dry friction which is undesirable in making\n\ndynamic measurements. Figure 8, not to scale, shows position of the gages on the balance structure required\n\nto measure the six components of the resultant force and moment.\n\n\n63\n\n;~t-,\n\nA\n\nK\n(.\\\n\nF\n?1~..\n\n~.\'\n-.\n\n\'4.\n-<~--\n\n.\xc2\xad\n\n--- \'*-~\'-~t-r\n\n.1-.\n*\n\n2~z\n\n~t~\'A\n\n/~7\'-..\n\n-~\xc2\xad\n\n-~ \n\n\nOr-.\n\n-t\n\nv-k..\n\n-.\n\n~.\n\n-e\n\n\n-?\n\n~//-O\n\n.~\n\n\'47 ~&~LaA~A 2 Sr.\n\nFigure 4.\n\n-t\n\ng\n\nA\n\nt\n*\n\n~0\xc2\xad\n\n*\n\n.4,\n\n-U\n-\n\n,>-\n\n*\n\n-\'\n\n.cn\n\n*\n\n-v\nN\n\n...........\n\n\n\'-\'4\n-~\n\n-a\n\n*\n\nif"\n\n~\n----\n\n-\n\nI\n\ny-,\n\n4\n-\n\nA\'\n\n~.\xc2\xad\n\n\'S\n\nFigure 5.\n\n64\n\n~\n\ncQPID\n\nYA\n\nYAW M.\n\nJL .\n\n.\n\nt\n\nAll %\n\nR.\na,\'D\n\n-T-\'I,\n\n\'4\'\n\nC\n\nCHOR\n\n-\n\n-\n\nY -- JY\n\nI\n\nI\n\n,\n\nC\'\n\nAFT RESERVOIR\n\nAXIAL FORCE\nSECTION\n\nFORWARD\nRESERVOIR\n9:\n\n-AFT\n\nFORWARD\nRESERVOIR\n\nRESERVOIR\nOUTLET\nTUBE\ns\n\nf!:.PLUGS\nFigure 9.\n\nINLET\nlumm\n\nIn order to keep the balance configuration as stiff as possible, the measuring elements are designed so\nthat as large a percentage as possible of the load components to be measured are supported by their respective\n\nmeasuring elements. The percentage of the loads not measured (but supported) by those elements is minimized\n\nby making the measuring elements as limber as possible to components of loading not being measured by them.\n\nThus, designing the measuring elements to the relatively high loads results in relatively thick bending\nsections. This gives more stiffness for a given measured bending strain level resulting in high element\nnatural frequencies.\n\n3.\n\nWater Cooled Balance Designs\n\nThe development of high temperature commercial strain gages has not\nachieved the degree of reliability and accuracy that .arrants their use\n\n\non our wind tunnel force transducers (balances). lie\nhave, therefore, chosen the course of water cooling\n\nour balaboes. Some of our earlier attempts incorporated an inner body which acted as a reservoir to which\nwere attached inlet and outlet tubes which spiraled around the balance and sting. Although this technique\nwas successful, it wans bulky and difficult to apply in our smaller models.\n\n/\n\nr\'\n\n\'-\n\nFigure 10.\n\nBalance number 51SO-\'\n\n67\n\n\nMore recently we have been building one piece balances which are so drilled and bored that we achieve water\ncooled members in our moment cages with reservoirs in the forward model fitting and aft sting fitting.\nFigure 9 shows several views of our balance design 6148, a six component balance designed for hypersonic\nmissile testing. This balance is .\'5 inch in diameter and has soft rubber jumper tubes bridging the axial\nforce element. Fiberglass wool insulation is installed around the flexures and the entire actively strained\nportion of the balance is covered with an aluminum foil radiation shield to minimize the temperature gradi\xc2\xad\nents due to local conduction from ambient air and radiation from the model.\n\nThe smallest water cooled balance we have designed to date is a five component balance for hypersonic Dyna\n\nSoar testing which is .40 inch in diameter and about three inches long. This balance, which bears the number\n\n5158, has an axial force range of only .4 pound and a normal force range of 3 pounds (Figure 10).\n\n4. Force Calibration and Data Reduction System\n\nAnalysis of the deflection and initial displacement of\n\nbalance axes in respect to model axes indicate that the\nequations of gage output of a typical strain gage balance component may be adequately expressed, qualita\xc2\xad\ntively, as a polynomial of the second degree in twenty-seven (for a six-component balance) variables. These\nvariables are the six pri-mary variables of components; their squares; and their cross products.\nThus, the expression for the measured output (OWj)in arbitrary counts, of a component may be given as follows:\n(1)\n\nG =K1 N+ K S\n2\n\n+ KM\n3 1"\n\n+\n\n+\n\n5+\n\nI%\n\n--. K\n\n5\n\n5\n\n+\n\n( 6N\n\n2\n\nof which only one of the linear terms is the primary output of the balance component in question. The form\n\nof equation (1) is that which appears most logical to the calibrator wherein he sees an output which can be\n\naccounted for by an expression in terms of the external loads applied to the balance.\n\nHowever, by transposing terms we can achieve an expression for predicting a load component being applied to\n\nthe balance in terms of the output of that component in arbitrary counts and other load components being\n\napplied. Expression (2)below for reducing normal force illustrates this form of the gage output equation\nwhich is most useful in force testing.\n\n\n( N\n(2K\n\n+ (\nK\n\n+\n\n()N.M\nN\n\nM +\n\nC2)S.\n\nThe contents in the brackets are the interaction errors which are subtracted from the raw; output term\nN in this case). The individual interaction sensitivity constants are ratioed to the primary component\nsensitivity constant (K in this case) and, thus, the interaction constants (parentheses) are seen to be\n\n1\nnot a function of instrument sensitivity. Thus, the values of the interaction constants may be determined\n\nfrom calibrations run in the laboratory, while wind tunnel force tests may be run on different, but com\xc2\xad\npatible, readout installations.\n\nOur standardized six-component calibration procedure consists of 35 primary (variable) loading routines and\n\neight initial weight tare calibrations. The initial loadings are substituted in expressions of the form of\n\nequation (1)for the "zero" conditions, while the initial and applied loads are substituted for the loaded\n\nconditions. These equations are solved simultaneously to derive the constants of the form K through K27 in\n\nexpression (1). Of course, these constants are valid only for the calibration setup. However, by dividing\n\nby the appropriate sensitivity constants we achieve the interactions constcnts as used in wind tunnel force\n\ntesting (see expression (2) ). To aid in test monitoring the size of each term in percent of maximum com\xc2\xad\nponent range with maximum balance loads applied is also computed.\n\n\n68\n\n\nTihese computations were originally programmed for the IBI-650 machine but are now performed on our Univac.\nAny combination of conponents up to a maximum of six may be computed since the form of the computation is\n\nidentical for each component.\n\nCalibration data at present is plotted and manually faired.\n\nThe faired\n\n\nvalues of the zeros and loaded end points and their corresponding loads (both initial and applied) are in\xc2\xad\nput to the machine.\nThese computations,\n\nthough straightforward,\n\nwould be tedious and time consuming if\n\nperformed manually.\n\nOur\n\ncalibration loadings absorb between two to six shifts elapsed time and are performed manually.\n\nOne of the more interesting phases of the calibration data reduction program are the methods of checking our\n\ndata and computations.\n\nUsing the derived coefficients of our gage output equations the nmachine program com\xc2\xad\n\nputs t\'eoretical values of the end point meter deflections for each of our standardized calibration conditions.\n\n\nIt then subtracts from these the values of the corresponding experimental.(calibration) meter deflections.\n\nThese differences, which tie refer to as "random scatter and/or error", represent possible errors in calibra\xc2\xad\ntion loading, curve fairing, reading the faired curves, data transcribing, and/or machine computation.\n\nBy far the most common sources of error are curve reading and data transcribing. These sources of error we\nhope to mininize soon with a new digitized force calibration readout system and prograned curve fairing.\n\nBALANCE CALIBRATION DATA REDUCTION\nOUTPUT INFORMATION\nINFORMATION\n~~RANDOM\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n\nrBALtNt\n\nUTR\n250071637\nL=09\n250071644 CatkN\nLL-1\n25n011651\n250071658\n2\n250071665\n4\n\'\n250071672\n250071679\n5\nL\n250071686\n250071693\n2500717n0\n250071707\n250071714\n250071721\n25071728\n25071735\n250071742\n250071749\n250071756\n250n71763\n250071770\n250071,77\n250071784\n250071791\n250071798\n\n6\n7\na\n\n0\n\n630102\n120689\n52319-\n\nZ\n\n/\n\nte\n\n55785710416638888\n166666\n149687544921598571\n168367\n169571\n64897\n19741\n\n6\n\n\'>.70\n\nL.J 13\n12\nr 13\nEI14\nZ\n15\n0 0 16\n1.

In early tunnels,\n\nthe \tmodel support struts attached to beam balances and the forces were measured by direct comparison with\ndead weights. The balances were necessarily situated outside the tunnel working section. Such "external\n\nbalances" are still in use in some present facilities. However, although servo-driven self-balancing devices\n\n(and more recently, the replacement of balance beams by force transducers)-have reduced the tedium and time\n\ninvolved in making force measurements, the external balance exhibits several undesirable features:\n\n1. \t Large tares due to the weight of the model support system (and pitching system when\nmeasurements are in "wind axes").\n2. \t\nLarge force transfer due to balance location away from model.\n\n3. \t\nSupport struts must be windshielded, hence pressure sealing may present a formidable problem.\n\nThese difficulties were largely overcome by locating the "balance" (as it is still called) within the model\n\nor between the model and a supporting strut. Where such an arrangement is employed, the support strut\n\nextends downstream from the model base and is called a "sting"; hence, the name "sting balance".\n\nThe construction of the internal (or sting) balance was made possible as a consequence of the invention of\n\nthe resistance strain gage. Early examples were little more than instrumented stings; strain gages were\n\nlocated in such positions as to give signals "proportional" to the applied aerodynamic forces and moments.\n\nDespite the subsequent refinement of both strain gages and balance geometry, single piece balances were\n\ngenerally characterized by significant coupling effects (interactions), large deflections, and limited load\n\ncarrying capacity.\n\nA reduction of strain gage physical size later permitted the consideration of an entirely different type of\n\ninternal balance. It was conceptuall very similar to the external balance in that the aerodynamicjforces\n\nand moments wvere mechanically resolved by a statically determinant array of members, each of which was instru\xc2\xad\nmented with strain gages. Thus, each member (or element) was a single force transducer isolated from the\n\nremaining forces by pivots located at each of its ends. Supported on the six elements was a model attach\xc2\xad\nment frame or sleeve, giving\'this type its name - "floating frame balance". Despite the similarity of\n\nfunction, size, and location of the two types of internal balances, it is edifying to examine the important\n\naspects in which they differ.\n\nTHE SINGLE PIECE BALANCE\n\nThe single piece balance is essentially a cantilever beam supporting a model at\n\n\nits end and instrumented with strain sensitive devices. If such a member is\n\nloaded at its end by some combination of forces and moments, the state of stress (and hence strain, for an\n\nelastic material) is completely determined throughout the member, Since it is impossible to completely\n\ndetermine the state of strain throughout a body, the loads on the member must be determined from a knowledge\n\nof the surface strains at a few discrete locations. That is, if several combinations of one, two, or four\n\ngages are each wired to give an electrical output (for example, a Wheatstone Bridge) proportional to local\n\nsurface strain, is it possible to equate each output to, say, a linear combination of the six applied forces\n\nand their products?\n\n\n94\n\n\n(OUJTPUT).\n\n=\n\n6\nE (k)\n\n6\n2\n\n6\n2 (kn)pqF p Fq\n\np=l q=l\n\n\nFp\n\np=l\n666\n+\t E\nz\n\n2\n\n(ka)pq r Fp Fq Fr\n\n+*...\n\n\npfl q=1 r-l\n\n6\n\n6\n\n+ z ....\n\nZ (kn)pqrstu Fp Fq Fr Fs Ft F,\n\np=1\n\nU-l \t\n\n()\n\n\nSuch a representation is sufficiently general; however, if the above equations for the outputs of a six\n\ncomponent balance were written out in full, they would involve 335,916 coefficients: Even though only\n\n5,562 of these are independent (under the assumption that outputs depend only upon load combinations rather\n\nthan loading sequence), the calibration required for their determination and the problem of inversion (sol\xc2\xad\nution for the forces from a set of output signals) would be formidable.\n\nThe practical limit for calibration\n\n\nand data reduction requires a system whose outputs may be represented by:\n\n\n6\n(OUTPT) u\n\n=\n\n(kn)\np=n\n\n6\np\n\nFp +\n\n6\n\n\nZ\nZ(kn)pq\np=1 q=l\n\nFp Fq\n\n(2)\n\nand further that the calibration slope constant of each component, (Kn) n\n be much greater than the remaining\n\n,\ncoefficients.\n\nThat is, each output depends predominantly on only one applied load component.\n\nIt is rather\n\n\nsurprising that a cantilever member can be constructed and instrumented with strain gages whose component\n\noutputs meet these requirements.\n\nIn \t\nthe general case, a bridge of strain gages is applied to an especialy\'-machined section:\neach force or moment component to be measured.\n\none such for\n\n\nEach section is configured and the gages mounted on it so\n\n\nas \t be sensitive to strains resulting from the application of only one force component and, insofar as\n\nto\npossible, insensitive to the strains produced by application of the forces.\n\nThe achievement of this end is\n\n\napproached by:\n\nI. Thoughtful design and careful machining\n\n2.\n\nCareful matching of gage sensitivities within each bridge\n\n\n3.\n\nPrecise gage placement\n\n\nIt is further apparent that the ratios between applied forces to be measured must be in the neighborhood of\n\nunity.\n\nThat is, a section greatly weakened to measure a very light force is incapable of supporting the\n\n\nremaining large forces, not to mention the inability to remain insensitive to the large strains imposed.\n\n(Note that moments my be approximately compared with forces by dividing each moment by the largest balance\n\ndimension lying in the plane of the moment\'s action.)\n\n\nThe above limitation renders this type of balance unsatisfactory for measurement of chord (model axis) forces\n\nin most aerodynamic problems.\n\nBalances which must measure relatively light chord forces are equipped with\n\n\na pivoted axial clement, isolated from the remaining forces by a flexured cage.\nis \t\npartially of the floating frame type.\n\nIn this sense the balance\n\n\nThe most successful recent examples of the single piece balance.\n\n\ngroup more than one measuring component at each station.\n\nIn fact, it is not now uncommon to sense five\n\n\nforces or moment components at one elaborately machined section and chord force as described above.\n\nThe\n\n\nsection offers multiple parallel load paths to the applied forces and in philosophy approaches the floating\n\nframe balance.\n\n\n95\n\nTHE FLOATING FRAME BALANCE\n\nThe floating frame balance consists of a cantilever member which supports a\nmodel mounting frame or sleeve by moans of a statically determinant array of\n\none-component force transducer links. Each link or element is provided with pivots at each end in order to\n\npermit only one component of load to be transmitted through the element under any combination of applied\n\nloads.\n\n\nIn general, there are any number of possible orientations of the elements which provide mechanical resolu\xc2\xad\ntion of applied forces and moments into single force components through each element. For a specified\n\ncombination of capacity loads, a particular configuration usually provides optimum resolution and over-all\naccuracy; however, the wind tunnel internal balance is confined within a very specialized package shape.\nThe most usual external shape is that of an elongated circular cylinder whose axis is aligned with the\nmodel axis. Somewhat fortuitously, these spatial confinements are compatible with the element arrangement\nmost suitable for resolution of the usual force and moment combinations.\nBroadly, this arrangement may be described as a pair of vertically situated elements spaced apart longitud\xc2\xad\ninally; another pair of elements similarly spaced but lying in a horizontal plane; an axial element; and a\n\nconcentrically placed torque tube. The result is a rectilinear arrangement of normal force, side force, and\n\naxial force members and a pure moment measuring element. It should be emphasized that each element is capa\xc2\xad\nble of transmitting only one component of force (or moment) by virtue of its placement and the pivots provided\n\nat each end, and that, additionally, the transducer associated with each element is designed to be sensitive\n\nonly to the applied force. Consequently, the output of each transducer is proportional only to the value of\n\nits associated applied force and not upon any other applied force or combination of applied forces.\n\nThe proceeding discussion applies strictly to an idealized internal balance (rigid support structure, perfect\n\npivots, perfect initial alignment, negligible transducer deflections, and transducer output proportional to\n\nload). These effects are an approximation to the behavior of a real balance, albeit, a very close approxi\xc2\xad\nmation in several important cases - notably the lower force range balances. The reasons for departures from\n\nthe ideal behavior mey generally be attributed to the following real effects:\n\n1. Distortion of the model support frame ("outer sleeve")\n\n2. Deflections of the cantilever supporting member ("inner rod").\n\n3. Imperfect pivots preventing complete force separation and resolution.\n\n4. Deflection of elements including transducer) under loading.\n\n5. Transducer sensitivity to incidental non-primary loads.\n\n6. Transducer failure to produce output proportional to load.\n\nA final important source of abberative behavior not heretofore considered is:\n\n7. Sensitivity to thermal environment.\n\nBefore investigating in detail the results of these deviations from ideal, it is well to state some general\n\nconsequences which may he inferred.\n\nInitial misalignment will be a source of first order interactions, as will be the finite stiffness of the\n\npivots in transmitting small spurious loads to a slightly "cross-sensitive" transducer. These are minimized\n\nby careful pivot and transducer design.\n\nAbout one-third of the mathematically possible second order interactions will necessarily exist. Their\nmagnitudes are in proportion to the degree of misalignment produced by applied loads, and may be approxi\xc2\xad\nmately calculated from estimated element and structure deflections. Several of these are usually negligible\nand the rest are reduced by minimizing angular deflections under loading.\n\n\n96\n\n\nThird order interactions are, at most, on the order of second order terms squared. Hence, they may generally\nbe considered negligible since second order terms rarely exceed about 1 percent even under the most adverse\ncircumstances.\n\nTransducer inaccuracies impose a fundamental restriction on ultimate balance performance. Non-linearity,\nnon-repeatability, hysteresis, electrical signal zero drift with time, drift under load, thermal change of\n\nsensitivity, thermal zero drift, and sensitivity to other environmental conditions are all potential errors\n\nwhich must be minimized.\n\nA very important aberration to which the floating frame balance is susceptible is the introduction of thermal\n\nforces arising from temperature gradients (or dissimilar materials) through the balance. These are actual\n\nforces and not the thermal strains to which the transducer may also be sensitive (in these as well as in the\n\nsingle piece balances). Thermal forces always exist in a multiply confiected body (i.e., one with holes) in\n\nthe presence of temperature gradients.\n\nGenerally, these forces tend toward zero as the pivot stiffness decreases. Furthermore, since the thermal\n\ngradients encountered are rather consistently similar in most applications, it is particularly important to\n\nemploy the particular configuration which renders the thermal forces a minimum under the anticipated condi\xc2\xad\ntions. The most successful approach to this problem will be described in a later section of this paper.\n\nFLOATING FRAMAE BA NE COMONERnIS\' \t\n\nThe design of a floating frame balance involves the application of\n\nseveral branches of engineering technology. Although, in balance design\npractice, these several fields are intimately interconnected, an attempt will be made here to deal with them\nas separately as is meaningful in order to emphasize the primary function of each of the components and to\n\nbring out the principal considerations influencing their design.\nfollows:\n\n\nThe balance problem may be subdivided as\n\n\n1. Mechanical force resolution\n\n2. Strength of structural support members\n\n3. Pivots\n\n4. Transducers and strain gage techniques\n\n5. Attachments\n\n6. Calibration and operation\n\n7. Balance selection\n\n1. Mechanical Force Resolution\n\nThe arrangement of the forces resolving linkage system has been briefly\n\nmentioned previously. The general nature of the applied forces and the\n\n\nrestriction on shape dictate a particular arrangement of the pivoted links as shown schematically in Figure 1.\n\nA pair of elements placed on vertical diameters (of the circular cylindrical package) sense normal force and\n\npitching moment. Another pair on horizontal diameters sense side force and yawing moment. Axial (chord)\n\nforce is carried by a central longitudinal element and rolling moment is taken by a concentric tube around\n\nthe chord force element.\n\nThe above arrangement effectively solves the force resolution problem in a manner compatible with structural,\n\npivot, and transducer requirements. However, a radial temperature gradient introduces an axial thermal force\n\nwhich may be significant compared to the axial force capacity. Thermal error proved to be a severe limita\xc2\xad\ntion on the usefulness of this arrangement and for several years a variety of devices were employed in an\n\nattempt to cancel or compensate the spurious thermal output. The first balance to successfully overcome\n\nthis difficulty employed a deceptively apparent and minor mutation of element arrangement which eliminated\nthe troublesome thermal force even in the presence of the radial temperature gradient:\n\n\n97\n\nCN\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\nSchematic of early arrangement\n\n\nfor force resolving links.\n\n\nIn order to understand the method of averting thermal forces in the balance. it is necessary to examine the\n\nbasic problem.\n\nIf the roll and axial members are imagined to be removed, the resulting differential expan\xc2\xad\n\nsion between the inner rod and outer sleeve is\nof normal and side force elements.\ninner rod and outer sleeve.\n\n"centered" at a point midway between the forward. and aft sets\n\nAt any other station there is a relative axial displacement between the\n\n\nWith the axial force element installed at the balance forward end, the relative\n\n\ndisplacement there cannot exist and an axial force is developed of magnitude such as to overcome the normal\n\nand side force elements\' pivot stiffness in removing the displacement.\n\nIn other words, the differential\n\n\nexpansion is forcibly "centered" at the axial element station and if this does not coincide with the "natural\xc2\xad\ncenter (with axial element removed) of expansion, then a therma\n\naxial force will result.\n\nIt is, therefore,\n\n\nclear that the natural solution of the problem is to place the axial force element at the "thermal center".\n\n-The "Series - D" balances (after Robert Davie who first realized this configuration) employ dual (tandem)\n\naxial elements acting in parallel and positioned symmtrically with respect to the thermal center or "center\n\nof forces".\n\nThe dual chord force permits the otherwise impossible achievement of a completely symmetrical\n\n\ncentral position and, in addition, provides electrical cancellation of therml forces arising from a tempera\xc2\xad\n\nture difference between the inner rod and axial elements. The tandem axial elements are attached at their\n\ncommon center to the outer sleeve and at their ends to the inner rod.\n\nAn applied axial force produces forces\n\n\nof opposite sense in each element while forces due to temperature differences between inner rod and axial\n\nelement are of the same sense in each, thus producing no net signal from the combined outputs.\nof this arrangement is depicted in Figure 2.\n\n\n98\n\n\nAn example\n\n\nFigure 2. Cutaway view of a modern force balance.\nAs a natural consequence of the arrangement the roll element becomes a dual member attached as is the chord\nforce, and placed concentrically around it. Additional benefits are the virtual elimination of second\n\norder interactions involving normal forces times chord force or rolling moment, and side force times chord\n\nforce or rolling moment. Also, the second order interactions arjsing from pitching or yawing moment times\n\nchord force or rolling moment are substantially reduced.\n\nBecause of its many advantages, this arrangement of force resolving members is now practically in universal\n\nuse for floating frame balances. Minor changes in relative spacing of elements, etc., are dictated by each\n\nparticular combination of loads to be measured and the permissible physical size of the balance.\n\n2. Strength of Structural Support Members\n\nThe strength of the inner rod and outer sleeve is a relatively\n\nstraightforward stress analysis problem. The outer sleeve\n\n\nshould occupy as little space as possible yet provide adequate attachment for each of the elements and suffi\xc2\xad\ncient strength and rigidity to carry the loads from the model attachment device.\n\nGenerally, the inner rod occupies all of the space not taken by the outer sleeve or the elements. This is\n\ndon-, not only to maimize rigidity, but because the inner rod, rather than the elements, is a limiting\n\ncomponent in the maximum load carrying capacity of a balance: Since, as shown in Figure 2, the inner rod\n\nis machined to provide clearance holes (as well as mounting seats) for the elements, the size and shape of\n\neach element is to some extent governed by the structural requirements of the inner rod. The inner rod is\n\nprovided with a means of attachment to the supporting sting. Most usually this is accomplished by a tapered\n\n\n99\n\n\njoint which is locked and keyed.\n\nWhile the design of this joint is not of fundamental importance in balance\n\n\nperformance, it is a very critical area and will be discussed presently.\n\n3. Pivots\nThe pivots used at each end of the elements have a definitive effect upon balance performance.\n\nWhile they need not deflect through large angles, they must be compact, rotationally free, axially rigid.\n\nand absolutely without axial backlash or rotational hysteresis. The only pivot which approaches these qual\xc2\xad\nities is the elastic pivot employing integral flexible portions or "flexures".\n\nThe simplest elastic pivot providing the two degrees of rotational freedom required (universal joint) consists\n\nof a pair of flat strap flexures in tandem at right angles to each other. The only defect of the elastic\n\npivot is its elastic restoring moment resisting angular deflection.\n\nThis pivot stiffness introduces redundancy into the ideally statically\n\n\ndeterminant system. However, if the actual forces in each element are\n\n--\n\n"*closely approximated" by a statically determinant analysis, then it\n\nmay be expected that, except for slight change in the apparent sensitivity of each transducer, the balance will behave substantially as if\n\nS\n\nit had perfect pivots. A crude calculation serves to establish the\n\ndegree to which the real balance approaches the statically determinant\n\n\nI\n\nideal. Consider six identical elements, each comprised of a pair of\n\nstrap flexures at each end and an intermediate strain gage trans\xc2\xad\nducer as shown schematically in Figure 3. The lateral force, S. required\n\nto deflect each element a distance, 5, is related to the restoring\n\nSflat\nL\n\nmoment of the flexures, M:\n\nS\n-\n\n.2\n\n(3)\n\nH\n\nwhere H is the flexure spacing.\n\nThe moment is dependent on the deflection angle, 8, and the flexure\n\ngeometry\n\n\nFigure 3.

Another advantageous feature is that all of the machine\n\nwork on an element may be completed before the flexures are "sawed-free" to permit the flexures to deflect.\n\nOccasionally, compatibility or stress\nrequirements indicate a longer flexure\n\nKthan\n\n7\n\ni\n\nIr\n\nL\'\n\n_\n\nEFF.\nD LEF\n\ncan be obtained with "circular arc"\ntypes.

Typical flexure used in force balance,\n\non them by the axial deflections of a\nloaded element. A synonymous term is\n"compliance": it is the reciprocal of\nthe spring constant.\n\nThe behavior of a flexure in bending while subjected to axial force is in itself a problem of some complexity.\n\nThe beam-column analysis required has been presented by Eastman and others for the case of a flat strap,\n\nconstant thickness, flexure for several possible modes of loading. The results of importance for balance\n\napplication are that as axial force increases:\n\n1. The position of the center of the center of rotation shifts\n2. The allowable angle of rotation decreases rapidly\n\n3. The apparent restoring moment or angular spring constant changes.\n\nThe proper axial force parameter is the ratio of applied force to critical buckling load. These effects are\n\nshown quantitatively in Figure 5, with terms explained in the sketch of Figure 4. The surprising consequence\n\nis that the effective spring constant in bending increases with compressive load and decreases with tension.\n\n\n101\n\nThe flexures used in the\n\n\n4.0 "\n\ninternal balance under dis\xc2\xad\ncussion are usually of the\n\n"circular arc" type with\n\nI0-40 \t\n\nL\n- 3 0\n\n-.\n\nsides formed by parallel\ndrilled holes such that the\n\n0-\n\n_othickness\n\nvaries continuously\nalong their length.

Flexure lengths of greater than about 3 times their thickness are rarely\n\nuseful except to reduce otherwise intolerable bending stress levels. In fact, it is apparent that very\n\nlong flexures in a moderately non-compliant balance will lead to significant non-linearity in the second\n\norder interactions (tantamount to a third order interaction) due to the non-linearity of restoring moment\n\ndepending upon load.\n\nLong flexures are justified only when the transducers involved are much more deflec\xc2\xad\ntive than "tension-type" or when the reduction of flexure bending stress permits the flexure to be substan\xc2\xad\ntially thinner.\n\nA general practice appropos the above discussion is to design the balance with maximum flexure s\'acing and.\n\nvery thin flexures (so that the direct flexure stress is near the permissible working stress). Excessive\n\nbending stresses should be reduced first by increasing flexure diameter and only then, if necessary, increas\xc2\xad\ning flexure thickness.\n\nOnly in severe cases will elongation of flexures be necessary.\n\n\nIt is of value at this point to note (with a little hindsight) that an estimate of the limiting loads for\n\nwhich the balance may be expected to operate as a nearly statically determinant system can be made from\n\nflexure considerations alone. If each normal force\n\nelement has the dimensions shown in Figure 7, where\n\nb= 1 D\n\n"D" is the diameter of the model cavity (and balance\n\nof\n\nthen the average fraction\noutside diameter), through flexure stiffnesses is\n\napplied load "lost"\nfound from the previously obtained expression:\n\n\nP)\n\n1 percent.\n\n.(9)\n\nIf the greatest ratio between capacity loads is of\n\norder ten, then about 10 percent of the lightest\n\n\nload may be diverted by the flexures of the other\n\nelements.

In fact, the high dynamic pressures now available in some tunnels\nhave necessitated construction of balances whose operating capacity resulted in load parameters nearly twice\n\nthose coresponding to extended range balances: It is, frankly, startling, not that such a balance exhibits\nanonmlies, but rather that it yields data of nearly the same order of reducible accuracy as a standard-range\nbalance.\n4, Trarnducers and Strain Gape Techniques\n\nThe transducers integral with each element may be considered\n\nthe heart (or better, nervous system) of the balance.. The\nfundamental requirement of each transducer is that it be of a size commensurate with the available space\nand that it produce the required output from the load component it is to sense. The additional objectives\nof\n1.\n2.\n\nlow deflection\nlinear output\n\n\n3.\n4.\n\nlow hysteresis or non-repeatability\n\ninsensitivity to extraneous forces and moments\n\n5. insensitivity to thermal environment\n\n\n6. insensitivity to pressure change and humidity\n\n7. ease of fabrication\n\n8. ruggedness\nare each separately achievable but difficult to attain simultaneously at an acceptable level.\n\nThe trans\xc2\xad\n\nducer configurations possible are literally unlimited, however, a number of specific types have found\nrepeated application by virtue of their general satisfaction of at least most of the requirements. The\nmost coron species are:\n\n1. tension-type\n2. eccentric columns\n\n3. ring-types\n\nBefore describing and comparing these specifically, consider a few generalities.\n\nThe deflection of a body under external loading is generally determined by applying the principal of con\xc2\xad\nservat\'ion of energy:\n\nW\n\n=\n\n-\n\nConst.\n\n=\n\n0\n\n(18)\n\nWhere W is the external work done by the applied loading and U is the strain energy of the body; hence, for\n\nthe case of uni-axial loading of a linearly elastic body the equation becomes,\n\nPa\n\n=\n\nI\n\nfff\n\nde d(vol.)\n\nf\n\n=\n\n2 d(vol.)\n\n(19)\n\nvolume\n\nvolume\n\nThe formula is already specialized to the case where only one significant component of strain (stress) is\n\ndeveloped in the body due to the applied loading, P.\n\nFor the case of a prismatic member of length, L. width b, and thickness tt loaded axially such that the\naxial strain is uniform throughout the member-\n\n\nI -\n\nf\n\nK\n0\n8 2\ne 2\nF\n\ne dx\n\n0\n\ntbL\n\ndy\n\ndz\n\n0\n82A\n\n\n(20)\n\n2v\n\n105\n\n\nfrom which it would appear that for a given strain gage output (or strain level) and for the minimum\n\nvolume, v, on which a strain gage may be mounted with adequate power dissipation (which also places a\nlower limit on the body thickness), the deflection decreases without limit as the load capacity of the\ntransducer increases. Unfortunately, there is a constraint between strain load and cross-sectional area\nsuch that the proper expression is\n8\n\n=\n\neL \t\n\n(21)\n\nHence, for a fixed minimum length for gage mounting and fixed output, the deflection is independent of load.\nFor the case of a prismatic member in pure bending such that the bending stress (and strain) vary linearly\nthrough the thickness and upon which is superimposed a uniform stress due to the axial load P.\nL\nb t\n"f\n\n8\n82~\n\n=\n\nIE\n\n2\n\n2\n\na2\nNFFtbL\n\n=\'\n\n3\n\nx2\n\nd:dy\n\ndz\n\n(22)\n\n5 vE \t\n\nThere is an apparent reduction of deflection by a factor of three compared with the direct tension transducer\n\nelement for the same minimum strain gage mounting volume. Furthermore, it is possible here to use a four\xc2\xad\nactive gage Wheatstone Bridge circuit while the tension-type element has only two active, or at best, two\n\nfully active and two 0.3 active gages when Poisson\'s Ratio effect is utilized. The net result is that this\n\nidealized bending menber has only about 22 percent the deflection of the optimum tension-type element for a\n\ngiven sensitivity. There is,furthermore, no longer the restrictive condition relating load, strain, and\n\ncross-sectional area since the bending moment my be arbitrarily adjusted to achieve the desired strain at\n\nthe minimum practical cross-sectional area independent of load. It must be noted that the vanishing deflec\xc2\xad\ntions indicated as load P, increases are not attainable. The shear strains in a cantilever member or the\n\naxial strain for an eccentric column are not negligible as the load increases and the section is kept small.\n\nThe result for the eccentric column including strain due to axial loading as well as bending is\n\ntbL?\n\nF tbL\n1 +\t\n\n1\n\n(23)\n\nwhere e is the eccentricity of the active portion of the column. There is now an additional relationship\n\nload, eccentricity, strain and section dimensions:\n\nbetween \t\nE\n\n=\t\n\n(24)\n\n6Pe\n2\n\nbt\nthe proper expression for deflection is\n\nso that \t\n\n8 = 2sL 1[(1) +\n\n(25)\n\n1 \t\n\nThe deflection is minimized at e/t = 0.268 for which\n\n8 .\n\n0 1.154\n\n(26)\n\n\neL \t\n\nAt the same strain, then, the best eccentric column is about 15 percent more deflective than the best\n\ntension-type element; however, in terms of electrical sensitivity, the eccentric column is about 25 percent\n\nless deflective!\n\nThis difference is not very significant in the light of the many practical considerations such as load\n\n\n106\n\n\nmagnitude, linearity, sensitivity to temperature and extraneous loads, and physical size which usually\n\ngovern the final choice. It is apparent that the transducer deflection may usually be estimted for pre\xc2\xad\nliminary design purposes by considering a simply tension-type element.\n\nThe same principles apply to a shear sensitive section with the important result that where such a section\ncan be employed it my be much less deflective. This is because the shear web on which the gages are\n\nmounted may be made an order of magnitude thinner than the tensile or bending sections diflcussed previously\nsince the unstressed flanges which are usually associated with a shear section serve as heat sinks to dissi\xc2\xad\npate the electrical strain gage power generated. However, only a particular combination of circumstances\npermit the advantageous utilization of she-r transducers in a floating frame balance, sinoe practical shear\ntransducers are ungainly in size and shape.\nA tension-type element is most simply a prismatic post whose cross-sectional area is determined by the strain\nlevel requirements and whose lateral dimensions permit attach\'ent of strain gages. Even 4here only two gages\nare active in a bridge circuit, thermal compensation dictats that the two dummy gages bo located proximate\nthe active ones. In practice, low sensitivity to extraneous loads is obtained by maintaining large lateral\ndimensions. Typically, an "I" or "\' section is used. Commonly, the active gages are mojnted to the outer\nsurface of the flanges and the lateral gages are mounted on the web. In this case, it is often possible to\n\nrealize a slight increase in sensitivity by taking advantage of a secondary ring bending offect. An even\nmore successful arrangement is to mount the primary gages on the web which is aligned with the adjacent\n\nflexures for a local augmentation of stress, and to mount the lateral gages on the outer ;urface of the flanges.\nThe flanges are (with proper design) subject to a secondary lateral bending similar to anticlastic bending\n\nsuch that the net output may approach that of a four active gage bridge operating at the\nlevel. Furthermore, sensitivity to extraneous loads are even more reduced.\ncourse, possible and most have been tried at one time or another.\n\n\n4 .orage\n\naxial strain\n\n\nMany other arrangements are, of\n\n\nStrain gaje elements\'of this type always exhibit "negative" non-linearity (less output in compression than\nin tension) due to\n\n1. Poisson\'s Ratio change of area under loading\n\n2. the logarithmic dependency of "natural" strain (to which the strain gage is tensitive) upon\n\ntotal strain.\nThese two effects result in a quadratic non-linearity of from 011 percent to 0.3 percent at a ndminal sensi\xc2\xad\ntivity of one millivolt output per volt input.\nThe eccentric column is simply a member displaced from the axis of loading, dimensioned t.\n\ndevelop the proper\n\nbending strain under the influence of the resultant bending moment, and instrumented to O.-e\n only the bend\xc2\xad\ning strain with four active gages. The bending takes place in the same plane as that per\' tted by the\n\ninboard flexures of the element so that the column bending moments are nearly statically : terminant. Depend\xc2\xad\ning upon the relative bending stiffness of the inboard flexures, the transducer is to a qrItater or lesser\nextent dependent on extraneously applied moments in the plane of the eccentricity. This .,desirable effect\n\nis eliminated by splitting the column longitudinally into two halves, each of which is ecvtentric, but on\nopposite sides of the axis of loading. Hence, the sense of bending is always opposite in these two members\n\nsuch that a net extraneous bending moment of the same sense in both members is electricaI.! cancelled. These\nelements may be made to be sensitive to much smaller applied forces than the tension-type tlement. They are\nalways non-linear in a positive sense (increased output in compression) due to the change In eccentricity\n\ncaused by loading. The magnitude of non-linearity is calculable to be proportional to:\n\n(L/0)et)-\n\n2p\n\n(27)\n\n107\n\nwhere L/t is column length-thickness ratio, g is Poisson\'s Ratio, and e/t is as defined previously\n\nRarely\n\n\nis it possible to reduce L/t to the order of twice Poisson\'s Ratio; hence, linearity is "positive" and nay\n\nbe further decreased by increasing eccentricity. This is contrary to the deflection criterion which indi\xc2\xad\ncates e/t ratios of about 0.3. The necessary compromise is a difficult one to make; the usual course being\n\nto minimize length as much as possible and to favor the deflection in selecting low eccentricities at the\n\nprice of non-linearities ranging between 1/4 and 3/4 percent at one millivolt per volt. Again, many other\n\nfactors enter in the final choice.\n\n\nSQUAkRE RING\n\nDOUBLE ECCENTRIC\n\nTASK RING\n\nCOLUMN\n\nRACE TRACK\n\nI OR H SECTION\n(POISSON EFFECT)\n\nFigure 9. Flexure configurations used in force balances.\n\nThe "ring-types" are variations of the eccentric column, or rather the double-eccentric column described\n\nlast. Initially, they were made to approximate circular rings of constant cross-section for ease of stress\n\nanalysis and design synthesis. These were difficult to machine, overly deflective, space consuming, and\n\npresented only curved surfaces for gage mounting. Even so, such rings were not exactly predictable by\n\nsimple ring formulae. The modified ring or "race-track" element has found wise use in internal balances.\n\nIts advantages are\n\n1. the width of the gaged portion is great enough to permit "stress-balancing" such that the\n\ngage bonds in each case "see" only the useful bending strain and need not electrically cancel\n\nthe net axial strain\n\n2. the distance between the inboard flexures is greater, than that for an equivalent eccentric\n\ncolumn\n\n3. it is very rugged and virtually unaffected by extraneous loads.\n\nThe second feature is an advantage only in moderately large balances where maximum flexure spacing is\n\n\n108\n\n\ndesirable with minimum active gage length. Despite these features, the "race-track", like all ring types,\n\nexhibits positive non-linearities and its deflections are greater than the eccentric column which would\n\nreplace it. Its large deflection argues against its use except in some light load components of moderately\n\nlarge balances and for light load applications in very small balances where size restrictions prevent\n\n"doubling" of the eccentric column and loads are too light for a tension-type member. This application has\n\nled to the "square-ring": short because of length restriction; broad to enable gages to be applied to the\n\ninner faces. The result is a practically linear output but very large deflections (relative to a comparable\n\ntension-type element).\n\nThe single eccentric column is often used in the dual chord force arrangement where space is limited and\n\nloads are very light. The moment sensitivity and non-linearity of the two (long) single columns cancel in\n\nthe net output of such a push-pull axial force element.\n\nIt nay be mentioned that in high load parameter balances the chord force output is limited when the axial\n\nforce requirement is very small. The compliance of the remainder of the balance to axial deflections may be\n\nless than that of the axial force element itself. In this case, increasing the sensitivity of the element\n\nmay reduce its stiffness (increase compliance) enough to offset the sensitivity increase, while stiffening\n\nmay likewise be offset by the resulting reduced sensitivity. This problem mutually invqlves flexure and\n\ntransducer design.\n\nThe most effective rolling moment transducer is simply a thin-walled circular tube on which strain gages\n\nare placed at 450 to the axis of the tube in order to sense only the shearing strain produced by torsion.\n\nThe deflection follows the same law found for tension-type members and non-linearity is negligible.\n\nThese by no means exhaust the transducer possibilities, since a complete morphology would be voluminous.\n\nSuffice it to say that others have been tried and still others are under development, some of which offer\n\ngreat promise for standard and special applications.\n\nLikewise, a discussion of strain gages, their selection, application, connection, temperature and output\ncompensation, protection, and operating environment would be a treatise beyond the scope of the present paper.\nWith-regard to balance design and practice, several (often conflicting) requirements should be approached as\nA\n,\nclosely as possible:\n1. Locate the gages of a bridge near one another with good thermal connection;\n\n2. Locate gages away from fibers strained by extraneous loads;\n\n3. Locate gages on surfaces as flat as possible;\n\n4. Use four fully active gage bridges where possible;\n\n5. Avoid mounting on thin surfaces (generally take .02" - .03" as a minimum);\n\n6. Use large-high resistance gages with maximum gage length;\n\n7. Design for surface strains of 500 to 1000 microinches per inch macimum;\n\n8. Use super-clinical cleanliness and care in preparing and mounting strain gages.\n\n5. Attachments\n\nThe balance fittings and attachments are quite ordinary and yet require the utmost care\n\nto avoid their compromising the balance\'s strength and accuracy potential.\n\n\nThe model must fit very closely on the balance diameter. The balance outer sleeve is a structural member\n\nand as such is subject to deformation necessitating the tightest possible fit in the model cavity. Axial\n\nand roll loads are carried by one or more very closely fitting pins between model and outer sleeve. It is\n\nstrongly felt that a significant contribution to hysteresis and non-repeatability (especially those of first\n\nand second order interactions) can be traced to poor calibration body and model fits on the balance. This\n\n109\n\n\nshould not be too surprising since the only joint on the balance system that is not either screwed or\n\nheavily pressed together is the model-balance attachment.\n\nThe normal and side force elements are customarily attached to the inner rod and outer sleeve with specially\n\nmachined cap screws.\nment to be made.\n\nClearance is provided at the outer sleeve joint to permit adjustments of element align\xc2\xad\n\nThis is one of the most important features of the floating frame balance in that eight\n\n\nimportant first order interactions of the thirty possible my be often reduced virtually to zero.\n\n(Only a\n\n\nhalf dozen or less of the remaining twenty-two are generally significant.)\n\nThe axial and roll members are attached at each extreme end to the inner rod with hardened steel pins pressed\n\nin burnished holes. At their center two rows of similarly pressed pins carry axial and roll loads from the\n\nouter sleeve.\n\nThe balance connection to the sting is the most difficult area of the balance to properly analyze. The\n\n"sting-socket" tapered joint must carry bending and shear in two planes and axial and rolling moment (with\n\n\nthe aid of two pins or keys).\n\nThe most conon modes of failure, aside from bearing failure of the roll\n\n\nrestraint pin slots; are:\n\n1. Fracture ?t the base of sting.\n\n2.\n\nBearing failure at base of sting,\n\n\n3. "Bell-mouthing" or cracking of socket lip.\n\nThe first two above are ameliorated at the expense of the third and vice versa.\nis adjusted accordingly, the remaining course is to lengthen the joint.\n\nWhen the sting"gage diameter"\n\n\nWihen this has been done, excessive\n\n\ngalling of the mating surfaces resulted from the inevitable motion between sting and socket in bending.\n\nIn\n\n\nshort, the limitation of balance lateral force and moment capacity currently lies at this joint rather than\n\nwith the complex system of pivots and transducers within the balance itself.\n\nStimulated by the need for thermal stability in the presence of continuous hypersonic tunnels with high\n\nstagnation temperatures (and model temperatures), an external water jacket for balance cooling has been\n\nintroduced.\n\nThis accessory has far exceeded its expectations. Most important, it permits maintenance of\n\nconstant balance temperatures under virtually any conditions, thus practically eliminating thermal errors.\n\n\nIn addition, the slight pressure expansion of the jacket securely looks the balance in the model. Even\n\nwhere temperatures can be withstood by a balance without cooling, such a jacket can greatly improve over-all\n\naccuracy.\n\n6.\n\nCalibration and Operation\n\nThe calibration sequence begins with a load check to determine what, if\n\nany, alignment is necessary.\n\nFollowing alignment, a minimum calibration\n\n\nconsists of step loading each individual component to rated load (both tension and compression) and return,\n\nand recording outputs to determine sensitivities and first order interactions.\n\nFor a performance calibra\xc2\xad\ntion, this may be sufficient (although some second order interactions may be checked). Thermal zero drift\n\n\nshould be monitored along with the thermocouple outputs for several thermal cycles.\ndetermine change of sensitivity of each component with temperature.\n\nIt may be necessary to\n\n\nFor a full calibration, it will usually\n\n\nbe necessary to check virtually all of the second order interactions to ascertain their values or non-exis\xc2\xad\ntence.\n\nThird and higher order load combinations are normally unnecessary and, in any event, are often\n\n\ndifficult to apply with sufficient accuracy.\n\n\nThe use of a balance requires, block diagram-wise,\n\n1.\n\npower supply,\n\n\n2. balance,\n\n110\n\n\n3. amplification,\n4. analog to digital converter,\nS. visual readout or card, tape or typewriting system,\n\n6. manual or digital data reduction and presentation.\nThis equipment may be very simple and yet very accurate, or it may be very elaborate. The primary advantage\nof an automatic readout and data reduction system is the increased rate at which data may be taken and pre\xc2\xad\nsented in final form. A facility which is expensive to operate is usually economically justified in instal\xc2\xad\nling a high speed automatic data acquisition system. Closer study of each case is needed to make" the decision\nas to the use of automatic storage and a low speed computer, or direct data reduction requiring greater com\xc2\xad\npater capacity. Such a sophisticated system is no assurance a oriorn of high accuracy. In fact. greater\ncare is indicated in ascertaining that a highly automated data handling system does not impose errors whose\nmagnitudes are of the same order or greater than balance inaccuracies. On the other hand, it is not prudent\n\nto employ a balance whose accuracy is less than desired when the remainder of the system is capable of mucb\n\ngreater accuracy and a relatively small additional expenditure could secure an instrument (balance) of\ngreater precision. All this is to say that the data acquisition and handling system should not compromise\nthe best balance to be employed, while on the other hand the balance quality should be such that truly necess\xc2\xad\nary accuracies may be obtained if at all possible. Finally, the choice of A-C or D-C; direct reading,\nfractional resistance chanqe, or null readout; magnetic tape, card punch, type-out, or automatic plotting,\netc., do not materially affect the design or instrumentation of the balance itself and will not be belabored\nherein, with the exception that the readout system should be sensitive to a maximum balance output level of\nfour millivolts for a very small balance increasing to not more than about twice this for a large balance.\nThe errors induced by self-heating of the strain gages due to excessive input voltage (power) can be in\nexcess of all other balance errors.\'\n\nProper determination of size and load requirements for a floating frame balance can\nmaterially affect the accuracy of the data. Generally speaking, the load parameters\nshould be as small as possible and the ratios of applied loads should approach unity. (The exception to the\nabove is that lateral forces of much below one hundred pounds and axial forces much below fifty pounds intro\xc2\xad\nduce difficulties in transducer design, although they can be generally overcome.)\n7, Balance Selection\n\n2\n\nIf the desired normal force and balance diameter result in a value of Rn(= N/1 ) much greater than 500 or\nif roll capacity indicates RI(= I/\nD) much above 160, every effort should be made to employ a larger balance.\nWhen it is realized that a 50 percent increase in balance diameter reduces Rn by more than one-half and R1\n\n\n\nby more than two-thirds ad that associated errors may be reduced by even greater amounts, the difficulty\n\nof employing the very largest possible balance is seen to be well justified.\n\nA second possibility is that the high loads desired are needed for starting or emergency stop conditions.\n\nIf such is the case, overload stops cal be provided in the balance withodt the detrimental effects otherwise\n\nassociated with high load balances. Normal to side force ratios greater than 3 or 4 and normal to chord.\n\nforce ratios greater than 10 or 12 are rarely needed and should be avoided. The absolute error of a very\n\nlight load element will generally be minimized if the above ratios are not exceeded even if only a portion\n\nof rated capacity of the light element is used: .\n\nIn the attempt to fully utilize the range of existing instrumentation, high input voltage and output sensi\xc2\xad\ntivity is often specified. Carried to excess, both of these requirements can introduce balance errors which\noverwhelm the gains anticipated from full use of instrument range. A rule of thumb for excitation voltage is\nm(2)\nwhile transducer sensitivities of 1.0 to 1.5 millivolts per volt are usually optimum.\nRationally, the accuracy of a s1-component balance should not be expected to equal that of a precision\n\nsingle-component transducer, especially when the balance loads approach those which would destroy a solid\n\npiece of steel of the same external configuration! The wind tunnel balance is often treated as the step\xc2\xad\nchild of the instrumentation field, yet it finds more "experts" ready to delve into its mysteries than\n\nmany a simpler device. These balances are, unquestionably, the most complex and compact transducers yet\n\nachieved; capable of separating and measuring six different but interrelated Variables simultaneously.\n\nIt is truly a tribute to those persons who have contributed to wind tunnel balance technology that such a\n\ndevice can be made; and that it Will perform with an accuracy that does, in fact, place it in the precision\n\ntransducer class.\nI11\n\n\ni1\n\n-\n\nCONTROL NUMBER:\n\n4 - ACCESSION NUMBER:\n\nU261\'426\n.....................................
