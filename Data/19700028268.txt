J. Berger and S. M. Seltzer of the National\nBureau of Standards completed their latest version of a computer program\ndesigned to trace both. electrons and photons through matter. Upon receiving\nthe program at Marshall Space Flight Center, comparison runs were initiated\nusing existing experimental data. The experimental data were supplied hy\nD. H. Rester l and W. E. Dance of Ling-Temco-Vought, Inc. The results of\nthese comparisons are presented in this report along v ith a brief description\nof the Monte Carlo computer program.\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MONTE CARLO PROGRAM\nInput Conditions\nThe Monte Carlo program depicts the following physical situation.\nEither electrons or photons are permitted to bombard a semi--infinite slab of\nmaterial. Upon striking the target, the incident or primary particles interact\nwith the material and produce secondary electrons and photons. These secondary particles are then followed through the target as are the primary particles.\nSince the target is finite in only one dimension ( its thickness) , the program\nmust neglect lateral effects. This is a good approximation to the actual experimental situation if the beam area of the incident radiation is small compared\nto the target area. The energy spectrum of the incident particles may be read\ninto the program as a list, or the incident radiation may simply be monoenergetic. In addition, the incident beam can be emitted from either a monodirectional source, an isotropic source, or a cosine-law source.\n\n1 13rivate communication\n\nr\n\nOutput of Program\nThe program computes the energy spectra and the angular distribution\nfor electrons and photons emerging from a target of given thickness. The output also ccntains the electron flux distribution, the energy and charge deposition,\nand the transmission and reflection coefficients. Only a repr(;sentative sample\nof information provided by the Monte rarlo program has been mentioned. The\ncomplexity of the program is demonstrated by the fact that many of the secondary particle interactions in the target are included in the final results. To be\nmore precise, electrons originating from such complicated interactions as\nAuger emission, pair production, Compton scattering, and the photoelectric\neffect are traced through the target material. Normally the program will\nfollow naturally occurring bremsstrahlung and characteristic x-rays; however,\nto improve the statistics, artificial photons are generated, suitably weighted,\nand then traced.\n\nInternal Structure\nThe internal structure of the Monte Carlo program is composed of\nthree basic parts: the input datatape, datapac-4, and etran-15. The datatape\ncontains various cross section data, including data related to the differential\nbremsstrahlung cross sections. Other parameters pertaining to the target\nmaterial are also included on the tape. Three datatapes are now available for\nuse, the only difference being the emprical correction factor that is applied to\nthe Bethe-Heitler bremsstrahlung cross sections. For datatape 0, the correction factor is equal to one; for datatape 1, the correction factor is obtained from\nexperimental data given by Koch and Motz; aad, for datatape 2, the correction\nfactor is deduced from experimental data collected by Aiginger, Rester, and\nDance. Datatape 2 is usually preferred, sinco it is based on the latest experim ental data.\nDatapae-4 converts the data stored on the datatape into convenient\ntabular form. In particular, it produces tables of energy losses and range\nvalues for electrons, differential and cumulative multiple scattering distributions for electrons, and other distributions that relate to bremsstrahlung production. Etran-15 then samples these probability distributions in a random\nmanner, and, in so doing, generates a large number of electron and photon\nhistories. After these histories are accumulated and analyzed, the desired\noutput is then tabulated so that the analytical results can be compared with the\nexperimental results. The only real limitation of the Monte Carlo program is\n\n2\n\nthe restriction it places on the configuration of the experir.ient (semi-infinite\nslab) . At the present time, the program is being run on the Univac 1106\nExec II computer. Additional information concerning either datapac-4 or etran15 may be found in References 1 and 2, or may be obtained from the author.\nCONI PAR i\n\nSON OF ANALYT ICAL AND EX PER I MENTAL RESULTS\n\nThe first experiment consisted of a monoenergetic beam of electrons,\nwith an energy of 2. 5 AleV normally incident on a target of aluminum. Data\nwere taken for target thicknesses 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 56, where the units of thickness are given in fractions of the mean electron range I p = z/ ro) . A parallel\nMonte Carlo run was then compared with the experimental data. Some of the\nresults are presented in Figure 1. A total of ten thousand primary histories\nwere permitted to accumulate before the computer run was terminated. The\ntheoretical and experimental results as a whole are in good agreement.\nWhen comparing experiment with theory, one must be aware of the\ninherent statistical errors found in the Monte Carlo program. Since the data\nbeing considered are differential in both energy and solid angle, it follows that\na large number of scattered electrons must be detected if the results are to be\nmeaningful. This presents no special problem to the experimenter, but it tail\nbe a problem to the theoretician. The analyst has a limited amount of available\ncomputer time, and therefore must put an upper bound on the number of primaryhistories generated by the Alonte Carlo program. This limitation could pose: a\nserious threat to thte accuracy of the theoretical calculations, particularly if the\ntarget is a thick high-Z material. At the present ti_,,e there are six target\nmaterials that can be used in conjunction with our Monte Carlo program: beryllium ( Z = 4) , aluminum ( Z = 13) , iron ( Z = 26) , copper ( Z = 29) , tin ( Z = 50)\nand gold ( Z = 7 9) .\nOther experiments have been simulated on the computer by using\nBerger\'s Monte Carlo program. They include non-normal as well as normal\nincidence runs. There are two cases of non-normal incidence to be considered.\nIn the first ease, an electron beam of incident energy 1. 0 MeV strikes an\naluminum slab at an angle of 30 degrees (with respect to the target normal).\nIn the second case, the first run is repeated with the angle of incidence being\nchanged to 60 degrees. Twenty thousand primary histories were generated in\neach of the two cases.\nThe next set of .Monte Carlo calculations used gold as the target maternal.\nTwo runs were exectued, varying only in the incident energy of the electrons\n\n3\nit\nJ\n\nr\nI\n\nNKr\'\xe2\x80\xa2CEDiNG PAG\n\nE BLANr.
