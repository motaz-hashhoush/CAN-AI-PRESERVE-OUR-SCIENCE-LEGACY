Callas\nProject Manager\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Spirit landed in Gusev crater on Mars on January 4, 2004,\nfor a prime mission designed to last three months (90 sols). After more than six years operating\non the surface of Mars, the last communication received from Spirit occurred on Sol 2210\n(March 22, 2010). Following the loss of signal, the Mars Exploration Rover Project radiated over\n1400 commands to Mars in an attempt to elicit a response from the rover. Attempts were made\nutilizing Deep Space Network X-Band and UHF relay via both Mars Odyssey and the Mars\nReconnaissance Orbiter. Search and recovery efforts concluded on July 13, 2011. It is the MER\nproject\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that Spirit succumbed to the extreme environmental conditions experienced\nduring its fourth winter on Mars. Focusing on the time period from the end of the third Martian\nwinter through the fourth winter and end of recovery activities, this report describes possible\nexplanations for the loss of the vehicle and the extent of recovery efforts that were performed. It\noffers lessons learned and provides an overall mission summary.\n\n1\n\nSCIENCE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nSpirit\xe2\x80\x99s six-year exploration of Mars produced an enormous number and range of scientific\ndiscoveries and insights [1, 2, 3]. Two discoveries stand out as the most important scientific\ncontributions of Spirit: the identification of widespread water-related soil deposits just below the\nsurface [4, 5], and identifying of carbonate minerals in the Comanche outcrop [6]. Early in the\nmission, verifying the presence of goethite in the Columbia Hills\xe2\x80\x94a hydrated iron oxide mineral\nthat only forms in the presence of liquid water\xe2\x80\x94confirmed the former presence of water at\nSpirit\xe2\x80\x99s landing site, fulfilling one of the prime science objectives of the mission.\nSpirit\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to Mars science did not stop there. Dynamic observations of dust devils,\nclouds, and other atmospheric phenomena added to our understanding of Mars meteorology. In\naddition, the mechanical properties of various soils were investigated, leading to the identification\nof several iron meteorites. Three distinct volcanic regimes were identified and characterized\n(unaltered Hesperian basalt flows in the Gusev Plains, a wide variety of basaltic alteration\nproducts in the older Columbia Hills, and a more alkalic, volcaniclastic assemblage around\nHome Plate in the Inner Basin). The presence of substantial unaltered olivine in the plains rocks\nprovided evidence that the basaltic plains probably have experienced only a cold and arid climate\n\n2\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nsince their formation. In contrast, a diverse suite of rocks with more extensive chemical\nalteration in the West Spur and Husband Hill bedrock indicates that aqueous processes were\nmore pervasive during the earliest epochs in this region. Because the Columbia Hills may be\nrepresentative of typical ancient cratered terrain on Mars, this investigation may be applicable to\ngeologic study of much of the planet. And the volcaniclastic formations associated with Home\nPlate indicate a completely distinct volcanic style from that responsible for the Columbia Hills.\nSpirit found widespread multiple occurrences of a layer of sulfur-rich salts (ferric sulfate,\ncalcium salts) and hydrated amorphous silica millimeters beneath the surface of the soil. The\nmost likely explanations for the presence of these minerals are all processes related to\nmobilization by liquid water or steam. The evidence for such water-related processes in a\nsurficial soil layer implies much more recent hydrous activity than that responsible for the\nancient bedrock of Husband Hill. Analysis of these sulfate salts shows a chemical connection\nwith the surrounding rocks in each case, providing additional evidence for an origin related to\nhydrothermal activity or acidic volcanic vapors. Furthermore, a strong 6-micron water band seen\nby Mini-TES in the Tyrone ferric salt deposit indicates that the salts are substantially hydrated.\nThis suggests that hydrated sulfates may be an important reservoir for near-surface water at low\nlatitudes over much of Mars, and could be responsible for the low-latitude hydrogen observed in\nMars Odyssey gamma-ray and neutron data.\nThe discovery of high-purity opaline silica deposits by Spirit (see Figure 1.1) is particularly\nsignificant because the hydrothermal conditions that they imply could have led to locally\nhabitable conditions. Any process that involves re-precipitation of silica from fluids can also\nprovide a mechanism for preserving evidence of microbes; indeed, morphologic microfossils are\nwell preserved in some terrestrial siliceous sinter deposits. These types of materials could be\nexcellent candidates for future sample return missions. And finally, in Scamander crater, Spirit\nwas able to establish that the sulfate-rich sands in which the rover was embedded have a vertical\ngradient in their chemistry (see Figure 1.2). This gradient is consistent with vertical modification\nby downward migration of soluble salts, enriching the upper section in calcium sulfates and\n\nFigure 1.1 Color Pancam image from Sol 1202 of the disturbed soil, named \xe2\x80\x9cGertrude Weise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n3\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nsilica. Downward migration is likely a consequence of thin films of water associated with solidstate greenhouse-induced warming of snow packs during periods of high obliquity.\n\nFigure 1.2 Color Pancam image from Sol 2163 of the disturbed soil around Spirit at the\nlocation named \xe2\x80\x9cTroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n4\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nA detailed and\npainstaking joint analysis\nof M\xc3\xb6ssbauer, APXS,\nand Mini-TES data\nacquired on the\nComanche outcrop near\nthe top of Husband Hill\n(see Figure 1.3) revealed\nthe presence of\nsignificant amounts of\niron and magnesium\ncarbonate minerals in\nthese rocks. Previously,\ncarbonates were found in\nALH-84001 and CRISM\nspectra of Nili Fossae,\nbut this is the first\npositive identification of Figure 1.3 Color Pancam image from Sol 689 of the \xe2\x80\x9cComanche\xe2\x80\x9d\nthis important mineral in outcrop.\nits geologic context. The\napparently similar chemical compositions of Comanche, ALH 84001, and Nili Fossae carbonates\nsuggest a common formation pathway, with multiple lines of evidence pointing to aqueous\nprocesses under hydrothermal conditions. The Comanche outcrops and their substantial\ncarbonate concentration (16 to 34 wt %) imply extensive aqueous activity under near-neutral pH\nconditions that would be conducive to habitable environments on early Mars. The well separated\nNili Fossae and Gusev crater carbonate locations (~6300 km on a great circle) imply that such\nenvironments have multiple occurrences in Noachian terrain. The high carbonate concentration\nin the Comanche outcrops is evidence for CO2 greenhouse-type conditions on a wet and warm\nearly Mars, and the subsequent sequestering of at least part of that atmosphere in carbonate\nminerals.\nThe discovery of carbonate in Comanche was not confirmed until four years after\nmeasurements were obtained on the outcrop; indeed, after Spirit had ceased communicating with\nthe Earth. The circumstances of this discovery illustrate what may be the most important\nscientific legacy of Spirit: the immense, rich data set left behind for future research.\n\nR EFERENCES\n1. Arvidson, R.

Spirit was located at approximately 14\xc2\xb0 S latitude and Opportunity was located\nat about 2\xc2\xb0 S latitude. The prime mission for the rovers was 90 sols (Martian days). With no\nconsumable on board, mission duration was greatly influenced by the reduction in available\nenergy as air-fall dust accumulated on the solar arrays and Mars advanced into the light-limited\nwinter season. Although designed with a high likelihood of operation for 90 sols, the long-term\nexpectation was that the rovers would lose capability due to excess dust obscuring the solar\narrays and the reduced winter light generating insufficient energy to survive the cold\ntemperatures of the southern hemisphere winter.\nAt the beginning of the mission (Sol 1), for example, Spirit generated more than 900 watthours of energy each sol. By Sol 90 (end of the prime mission), the daily energy production had\ndropped to about 600 watt-hours. In spite of this, operations continued and the mission was\nextended for both rovers.\n\n6\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nFigure 2.1 Diagram of the Mars Exploration Rover.\nBy the time of the first winter (Sol-A 254), the solar arrays were at only about 70%\nperformance for Spirit due to dust obscuring 30% of the arrays, lowering daily energy production\nto about 400 watt-hours. (The project uses a term called dust factor. A dust factor of 1 is a\nperfectly clean solar array, 0 is a completely obscured array, 0.5 means 50% of the solar array is\ncovered by dust, etc.) Figure 2.2 shows Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s solar array dust factor over the entire mission.\nAround Sol 420, Spirit experienced her first solar array dust cleaning event. These cleanings\nwere likely wind-related (e.g., gusts or dust devils) and effectively blew large amounts of dust\noff the rover\xe2\x80\x99s solar arrays. They occurred unpredictably, but with some seasonality and with\nvarying effectiveness. After the first instance of dust removal, energy production increased from\naround 400 watt-hours per sol to over 700 watt-hours, a significant improvement. This episodic\npattern of array cleaning was a principal contributor to the longevity of both rovers and their\nmultiple winter survivals. Cleaning events seemed to preferentially occur when Spirit was\nexposed to the wind at topographically high locations, such as ridge crests and summits.\n\n7\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nFigure 2.2 Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s historical dust factor over the entire mission.\n\n3\n\nLOSS OF MOBILITY\n\nOn Sol 779, after operating for more than two Earth years, the right-front drive wheel actuator on\nSpirit failed. Because of the design of the motor, which utilized magnetic detents and a largereduction (1500:1) gearbox, a failed wheel will not freely spin. Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s wheel would remain\nlocked, greatly compromising further mobility. Figure 3.1 shows the Sol 781 front Hazard\nAvoidance Camera (Hazcam) image capturing the effects of the failed wheel on the local terrain.\nNo explanation has been established for the\nwheel failure, although a motor brush\nfailure is one possibility. Also, the actuators\nwere operational well past their design life.\nSpirit had driven over 6.5 kilometers at the\ntime of the wheel failure, greatly exceeding\nthe design requirement of only 1 kilometer\nfor the rover mobility system.\nAlthough with compromised mobility,\nSpirit was able to conduct a successful\nscience and exploration campaign. Indeed,\nthe trenching action of the locked wheel\nwas largely responsible for the initial\ndiscovery of opaline silica mentioned\nabove. Figure 3.2 shows Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s odometry\nhistory over the entire mission. The change\nin progress is apparent after the Sol 779\nright-front wheel failure.\n\nFigure 3.1 Sol 781 front Hazcam image.\n\n8\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nFigure 3.2 Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s odometry history.\n\n4\n\nWINTER STRATEGIES\n\nActive measures taken by the operations team also contributed to each rover\xe2\x80\x99s longevity. For\nSpirit, Gusev crater was a dustier environment then Meridiani was for Opportunity, and it was\nalso further south, making the winters longer and darker. The operations team positioned Spirit\neach winter with a northerly tilt to enhance the solar insolation on the solar arrays (see Table\n4.1). During her first winter, Spirit was located on the north facing slopes of Husband Hill. Here\nthe terrain afforded the rover slopes around 13\xc2\xb0 to 14\xc2\xb0 of northerly tilt. With a healthy dust factor\nand favorable terrain, Spirit was able to remain active throughout her first winter.\nBecause of an ever-decreasing dust factor (see Table 2.1), each successive winter became a\nmore difficult survival challenge. After the first winter, the rover was required to be stationary\nTable 4.1 Summary of Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s winter tilt, dust factor, and daily energy production\nWinter\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nSol-A\n254\n923\n1591\n2260\n\nN.

More significantly, each subsequent winter necessitated\npositioning the rover, now with limited mobility, on an increasingly northerly tilt. Figure 4.1\nshows a reconstruction of Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s position for each of the four Martian winters.\nWith each passing sol, the available solar array energy was reduced. Figure 4.2 provides the\nhistorical energy production based on the Martian year (Sub-solar longitude). Southern winter\noccurs at a sub-solar longitude (Ls) of 90\xc2\xb0. Year 1 is the period from landing (Sol 1) to the first\nMartian fall. The first winter occurs in Year 2. The fourth winter occurs in Year 5. Note the\nprecipitously lower energy production in the approach to the last winter, the result of a lower\ndust factor combined with unfavorable tilt.\nThe Sol 779 wheel failure limited the amount of slope Spirit could climb to achieve\nimproved solar insolation to about 12\xc2\xb0. Spirit remained stationary on a modest slope (11.5\xc2\xb0)\nduring her second winter. With net increasing amounts of dust on the arrays, the third winter\nrequired an even steeper northerly slope for survivability, but the failed wheel would prevent\nSpirit from climbing those steeper slopes. The project was fortunate to have Spirit at Home Plate.\nHere the rover was driven from the top of Home Plate down the side slope. This afforded the\nrover a near 30\xc2\xb0 northerly tilt. Spirit could not have achieved that slope by driving up.\n\nWinter 1\n\nWinter 2\n\nWinter 3\n\nWinter 4\n\nFigure 4.1 Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s winter positions.

Realizing the downward secular trend in solar array dust factor, even\nwith occasional dust cleaning events, Spirit would require even steeper slopes than previous\nwinters. A detailed survey of the terrain showed no terrain features where the rover could\nachieve the necessary steep slopes. Even if they existed, the rover could not access them by\ndriving up, only by driving down from above.\nThe project made the decision to use the time before the next winter to conduct science in\nnew terrains to the south. Orbital imagery revealed two features of interest, named Goddard and\nvon Braun, about 150 meters away (see Figure 5.1). In addition to new science, these features\n(especially Goddard) presented possible opportunities for the rover to climb their interiors and\nachieve some amount of northerly tilt. Goddard exhibits a ring of light-toned material just inside\nits crater. Reaching that material was considered an important science objective while providing\nan opportunity to achieve a beneficial tilt, although likely wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be as steep as the north end\nof Home Plate during Winter 3.\nSeveral paths were considered to reach the targets to the south. Figure 5.2 shows the results\nof some of the route planning. Initially, Route 1 back onto Home Plate then across to the south\nwas the preferred route. It traveled along the best-characterized terrain, at least initially. In\naddition, Route 1 was the shortest path south and had the most downstream options. Route 2 was\na little longer and required an initial traverse over less characterized terrain. It too had many\n11\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\ndownstream path options. Route 3 was the longest route and traveled over the least characterized\nterrain. Earlier observations suggested that the terrain along the west side of Home Plate may be\nproblematic, with slopes and loose fines. The project prioritized the candidate paths with Route 1\nbeing the first choice, Route 2 second, and Route 3, if both Routes 1 and 2 proved impassable, as\nthe last option.\n\nFigure 5.1 Region south of Home Plate\n\n6\n\nFigure 5.2 Candidate routes to the south\n\nROVER EMBEDDINGS\n\nAfter Sol 1800, Spirit began the move along Route 1, the traverse up onto Home Plate. Soon the\nrover began to experience difficulty negotiating terrain with moderate slopes. Figure 6.1 shows\nthe Sol 1818 Hazcam images of the embedding that was occurring. After making extensive\nefforts, the project abandoned Route 1 on Sol 1829 and made the decision to pursue Route 2.\nAs a result of the embedding difficulty along Route 1, the project developed and\nimplemented the use of hazard avoidance maps. The maps combined terrain slope information\nwith science team assessments of soil types and terrain morphology to produce a red-yellowgreen tabular \xe2\x80\x98map\xe2\x80\x99 of terrain hazards. This information was used tactically to make decisions\nabout the safety of driving routes.

Figure 6.3 shows the Sol 1845 Hazcam images of wheel embedding.\nAfter several attempts to drive around Home Plate to the northeast, the embedding and\nproblematic driving forced the project to abandon Route 2. This occurred on Sol 1843, fourteen\nsols after abandoning Route 1 and\n49 sols since the departure from\nthe rover\xe2\x80\x99s third winter haven.\nWith the unsuccessful attempts\nalong Routes 1 and 2, it is\nimportant to note that precious\ntime had now elapsed to get Spirit\nsouth in time to conduct a science\ncampaign in and around Goddard\nand von Braun and then get\nprepared for the coming winter.\nExercising their last option,\nthe project started guiding the\nrover on the path around the west\nside of Home Plate along Route\n3. Figure 6.4 shows Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s\ntraverse around Home Plate just\nprior to her eventual embedding\nalong Route 3.\n\nFigure 6.4 Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s traverse around Home Plate by Sol\n1871.\n14\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nSpirit initially made good\nwestward progress along Route 3.\nFigure 6.5 is a Sol 1870 Navcam\nimage showing an apparently\nhazard-free traverse path. But on\nSol 1886, Spirit began to become\nembedded in a location on the west\nside of Home Plate, now called\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroy.\xe2\x80\x9d Realizing the onset of\nembedding, the project, just as it\nhad done for the embedding on\nRoutes 1 and 2, made several\ntactical attempts to extricate the\nrover. But after several\nunsuccessful tries, on Sol 1899 a\nstall of the left middle wheel\noccurred. Upon investigation of the\nwheel stall and an assessment of\nthe terrain, the project stood down\nfrom mobility operations. Figure\n6.6 shows the Sol 1899 Hazcam\nimages of the embedded rover\nwheels.

The path south to the features\nGoddard and von Braun, which was dictated by the systematic exhaustion of all viable route\noptions, led the rover to the unforseen hazard at Troy. This was a contributing cause. The root\ncause was that Spirit had degraded mobility (failed right-front wheel), which generated greater\nterrain shear forces that compromised the terrain\xe2\x80\x99s structural integrity, particularly on slopes. An\nundetected environmental hazard also existed along Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable route. Details of the\nembedding, including a root cause analysis, can be found in the JPL document \xe2\x80\x9cReport on the\nSpirit Embedding at Troy\xe2\x80\x9d, dated June 17, 2010.\n\n16\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\n7\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nROVER EXTRICATION EFFORT\n\nDue to the embedding of Spirit at Troy, the project drew upon its experience with Opportunity\xe2\x80\x99s\nembedding at Purgatory. For the Purgatory embedding, the project recreated the embedding with\nthe surface system testbed (SSTB) rover in the sandbox at JPL using custom soil simulants.\nThose tests provided guidance on procedures and expectations for the eventual successful\nextrication from Purgatory on Mars. The embedding of Spirit was significantly different, having\njust 5 operating wheels and its location in a more complex terrain environment. The situation\nprompted the MER project to pursue a more varied and ambitious ground-based simulation\nprocess, illustrated in Figures 7.1 and 7.2.\n\nFigure 7.1 Sandbox testing with the MER surface system testbed in simulated Mars conditions.\nAfter months of ground-based testing and independent project and programmatic reviews,\nextrication of Spirit was attempted on Mars. Table 7.1 summarizes the commanded motion of the\nrover since the commencement of extrication efforts on Sol 2078. On Sol 2092, the right rear\nwheel stalled. Subsequent investigation indicated that the wheel had failed, greatly reducing the\nlikelihood of successfully extricating as a four-wheeled rover. However, important progress was\nachieved during the last nine extrication drives from Sol 2144 to 2162. Figure 7.3 shows the\ncourse plot and progress of those drives. Extrication had to be stopped due to the limited solar\narray energy anticipated during the advancing winter. The project needed to use the remaining\ntime to prepare the rover for winter.\n17\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nFigure 7.2 Testing in simulant and aggregate of both the MER surface system testbed (SSTB)\nand the half-weight SSTB-Lite vehicle.\nTable 7.1 Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s Extrication Drives\nSol\n2078\n2088\n2090\n2092\n2095\n2099\n2104\n2109\n2117\n2118\n\nOdometry\n[m]\n0.02\n0\n0.02\n0.02\n0.01\n0.01\n0\n0\n0.02\n0.01\n\nOdometry\n[m]\n0.02\n0.05\n0.02\n0.02\n0.01\n0.04\n0.02\n0.02\n0.01\n0.04\n\nSol\n2120\n2122\n2126\n2130\n2132\n2136\n2138\n2140\n2143\n2145\n\n18\n\nSol\n2147\n2150\n2151\n2152\n2154\n2156\n2158\n2161\n2165\n2169\n\nOdometry\n[m]\n0.02\n0.05\n0\n0.04\n0.08\n0.01\n0.01\n0.03\n0.01\n0\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nFigure 7.3 Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s extrication progress from the last nine drive attempts.\n\n19\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\n8\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE FOURTH WINTER\n\nWithout adequate time to extricate Spirit before the onset of winter, the project configured the\nrover for the winter environment. The project used the last drive opportunities to try to improve\nthe northerly tilt of the rover. Unfortunately, this was unsuccessful and had little impact on the\nrover\xe2\x80\x99s already unfavorable tilt, with the arrays tilting south instead of north.\nThe unfavorable tilt of the rover made it susceptible to an increased risk of a low-power fault\nduring the winter and further risk of a mission clock fault if the rover\xe2\x80\x99s batteries were depleted\nsufficiently. And of course, there was the risk of a complete loss of the rover from the harsh\nenvironment.\nThe project implemented a long-range set of DSN X-band and UHF communication passes\nto carry Spirit through the winter season. Communication windows were scheduled nine months\ninto the future. The UHF passes in particular were complicated by orbit drift of the relay orbiters\nso far into the future. Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s fault windows were similarly complicated by clock drift over time.\nThe project also updated some onboard fault protection parameters.\n\n9\n\nLOSS OF SIGNAL, PROBABLE FAULTS, AND RECOVERY\nEFFORT\n\nThe last signal from Spirit occurred on Sol 2210 (2010-03-22). The first occurrence of loss of\nsignal was on Sol 2218 (2010-03-30). Subsequent to the loss of signal, the project began the\nrecovery effort for Spirit. That effort began with listening for the X-band fault windows (from\nlow-power/Uploss fault) and for the autonomous UHF windows (from Uploss fault). As the\ncontinued lack of response suggested a possible mission clock fault, the project implemented a\n\xe2\x80\x9cSweep&Beep\xe2\x80\x9d command strategy to elicit a response from the rover in the event the rover lost\nits knowledge of time.\nAll combinations of X-band and UHF transmit and receive hardware configurations were\nattempted as part of the recovery, along with commanding over a range of frequencies and times\nof day. Hardware (low-level) commands were attempted to exercise different boot banks within\nEEPROM. Between 2010-07-27 and 2011-07-13, 1411 commands were radiated as part of the\nrecovery effort with no detection of any signal at X-band (both polarizations) or UHF (through\nthe Mars orbiters).\nThe proximate cause for loss of the rover is not known, but is likely one of the following:\n(1) failure of a critical hardware element, such as the telecommunications (X-band and UHF)\nsubsystem, the central computer systems or communications bus, the power subsystem (batteries,\ncontrol board, switches), and the cabling; (2) insufficient energy from the solar arrays and\nbatteries to permit rover wakeup; or (3) the complete mis-synchronization of the recovery\ncommands with Mission Clock Fault.\nThe contributing causes include: (1) excessive dust on the rover solar arrays, reducing energy\nproduction; (2) the embedding at Troy, preventing favorable positioning of the solar arrays for\nwinter; and (3) the fact that Spirit was well beyond design life with hardware that experienced\nthousands of deep thermal cycles. The ultimate root cause was likely the damaging effects of a\nvery cold winter environment.\n20\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\n10 LESSONS LEARNED\nThe MER Project made several changes to rover driving practices subsequent to the Spirit\nembedding at Troy. The project also implemented important changes to driving practices prior to\nTroy as a result of embedding events around the north and northeast parts of Home Plate,\nalthough these changes did not prevent the Troy embedding. The project now routinely produces\nHazard Maps for drive planning in challenging or uncertain terrain. Further, the project\nestablished the Science Advisor role in tactical operations for mobility assessment. After Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s\nembedding at Troy, the project further implemented the 90% Slip Rule, where any detected\noccurrence of greater than 90% slip requires the project manager be notified and then requires\nproject manager approval to resume driving. The project also advanced the analytic tools for\nmobility assessment with the development of sophisticated terra-mechanics modeling to\ninvestigate mobility-terrain interactions.\nThe project also made changes to fault protection parameters (on Opportunity) to enable\nbetter predictability in the event of fault conditions. The UP_TOO_LONG parameter was\nlengthened to avoid rover shut-downs before fault communication windows. The project disabled\nthe coaxial switch change under the UPLOSS fault. This further avoids a potential switch failure\non Opportunity.\nAn extensive repository of project lessons learned can be found in the MER project archive,\nDocushare Collection #23581.\n\n11 CONCLUSION\nSpirit landed in Gusev crater on January 4, 2004, then crossed the Gusev plains, climbed the\nColumbia Hills, reached the summit of Husband Hill, and then descended to Home Plate. The\nrover survived three Martian winters and two major dust storms. Last contact from Spirit was on\nMarch 22, 2010. Spirit\xe2\x80\x99s scientific discoveries include evidence of ancient water and carbonate\nminerals indicating neutral pH environments, the existence of ancient hydro-thermal systems,\nand probable recent (last obliquity change) water action on Mars.\nBy any measure, Spirit was a tremendous scientific and engineering success. The rover\noperated for 2210 sols and drove more than 7.7 kilometers, well beyond the original 90-sol\nduration and 1-kilometer distance requirements. The appendix contains a summary of\naccumulated rover parameters.\n\nAcknowledgement: This work was performed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California\nInstitute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n21\n\nMars Exploration Rover Project\nJPL D-92756\n\nMER Spirit\xe2\x80\x94End of Mission Report\n\nAppendix A\xe2\x80\x94MER-A TRENDS (SOLS 1 \xe2\x80\x93 2210)\nMER-A Actuator Use (Sols 1 \xe2\x80\x93 2210)\nMobility Actuator\nLeft Front Wheel\nLeft Middle\nWheel\nLeft Rear Wheel\nRight Front\nWheel\nRight Middle\nWheel\nRight Rear Wheel\nLeft Front\nSteering\nLeft Rear\nSteering\nRight Front\nSteering\nRight Rear\nSteering\n\nMotor Revs\n(M)\n18.747\n17.450\n17.953\n14.620\n17.755\n17.413\n1.182\n1.248\n1.109\n1.303\n\nMER-A Notes:\nRight front wheel failed on Sol 779\nRight Rear Drive failed on Sols\n2100\xe2\x80\x932101\nMobility Actuators tested lifetime:\n10 million revs\nProjected prime mission use:\n2.5 million revs\n\nHGA Actuator\nHGA Azimuth\nHGA Elevation\n\nPMA Actuator\n\nMotor Revs\n(M)\n4.083\n5.590\n\nMI Dust Cover Actuations\nMI Dust Cover\n\nActuations\n942\n\nNote: Each open is one actuation.

ABSTRACT\n\nThe Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Spirit landed in Gusev crater on Mars on January 4, 2004, for a prime mission\ndesigned to last three months (90 sols). After more than six years operating on the surface of Mars, the last\ncommunication received from Spirit occurred on Sol 2210 (March 22, 2010). Following the loss of signal, the Mars\nExploration Rover Project radiated over 1400 commands to Mars in an attempt to elicit a response from the rover.\nAttempts were made utilizing Deep Space Network X-Band and UHF relay via both Mars Odyssey and the Mars\nReconnaissance Orbiter. Search and recovery efforts concluded on July 13, 2011. It is the MER project\xe2\x80\x99s\nassessment that Spirit succumbed to the extreme environmental conditions experienced during its fourth winter on\nMars. Focusing on the time period from the end of the third Martian winter through the fourth winter and end of\nrecovery activities, this report describes possible explanations for the loss of the vehicle and the extent of recovery\nefforts that were performed. It offers lessons learned and provides an overall mission summary.\n15. SUBJECT TERMS\n\nSpace Sciences\n\n16. SECURITY CLASSIFICATION OF:\na. REPORT b. ABSTRACT c. THIS PAGE\n\nU\n\nU\n\nU\n\n17.
