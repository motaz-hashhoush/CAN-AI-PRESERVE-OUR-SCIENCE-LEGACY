Local maxima in the column ozone distribution are often associated with disturbances in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, which may herald cyclone development in the troposphere. One research objective is to explore these issues by means of time series analysis of a zonal index of total column ozone, to suggest the existence or nonexistence of relationships between column ozone and dynamical processes which are known to occur on various time scales. Another objective is to investigate the correlation between the ozone mixing ratio on the 350 K isentropic surface and the column integrated ozone, and to investigate the use of an easily derived parameter as a proxy for ozone mixing ratio, which is conserved in the stratosphere for time scales shorter than the photochemical time scale. The source of data for these studies is the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data set.", "title": "Upper atmosphere dynamics", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920005326, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Miller, Timothy L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "50f8a0f355a9486fa70dca7aecdb2789"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920005326, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reynolds, Nathaniel D."}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama Univ.", "location": "Huntsville., United States"}}, "id": "8eeee4ca3cf3477794b7acb1aa97ade8"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920005326, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920005326, "id": "3ae5089a151b4f078f0a1434fa6ca4f1", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, NASA Upper Atmosphere Research Program: Research Summaries 1988-1989", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920005326.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920005326/downloads/19920005326.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920005326/downloads/19920005326.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920005326/downloads/19920005326.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
