The aerobraking return trajectory modes from high orbits employ transfer ellipses which have low perigee altitudes wherein the earth's sensible atmosphere provides drag to reduce the Tug descent delta velocity requirements and thus decrease the required return trip propulsive energy. An aerobraked Space Tug, sized to the Space Shuttle payload capability and dimensional constraints, can accomplish 95 percent of the geosynchronous missions with a single Shuttle/Tug launch per mission. Aerodynamics, aerothermodynamics, trajectory, quidance and control, configuration concepts, materials, weights and performance parameters were identified. Sensitivities to trajectory uncertainties, atmospheric anomalies and re-entry environments were determined. New technology requirements and future studies required to further enhance the aerobraking potential were identified.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730010100, "id": "7a8f893a20b34235a5402a67f578f317", "publicationDate": "1972-04-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19730010100.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19730010100/downloads/19730010100.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19730010100/downloads/19730010100.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19730010100/downloads/19730010100.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
