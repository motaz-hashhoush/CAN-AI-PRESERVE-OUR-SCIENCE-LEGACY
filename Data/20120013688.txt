Incompatible trace element contents of mafic igneous rocks are\nwidely used to constrain the petrologic evolution of\nplanets. We focus on incompatible element ratios of\nmartian meteorites to constrain the petrologic evolution of Mars in the context of magma ocean/cumulate\noverturn models [1]. Most martian meteorites contain\nsome cumulus grains, but regardless, their incompatible element ratios are close to those of their parent\nmagmas. Martian meteorites form two main petrologic/age groupings; a 1.3 Ga group composed of clinopyroxenites (nakhlites) and dunites (chassignites),\nand a <1 Ga group composed of basalts and lherzolites\n(shergottites).\nIncompatible Element Considerations: A spider\ndiagram shows that martian basalts and clinopyroxenites have mirror incompatible element patterns (Fig.\n1) [cf. 2]. Depleted basalt QUE 94201 has positive\nanomalies in P, Sr and the high field strength elements\n(HFSE) Zr and Hf, but not in the HFSE Nb, Ta, Th or\nU. Depleted basalt NWA 5789 has only small positive\nanomalies in Zr and Hf. NWA 5789 and QUE 94201\nare magma compositions [6, 7], and their incompatible\nelement patterns approximate those of their source\nregions. The clinopyroxenite Nakhla has negative\nanomalies in P, Zr and Hf, but no Sr anomaly.\n\n(element/Lu)PM\n\n10\n\n1\nN\xe2\x80\x90MORB\n\n0.1\nQUE\xc2\xa094201\nNWA\xc2\xa05789\n0.01\n\nNakhla\n\nCs\nRb\nBa\nTh\nU\nK\nTa\nNb\nSr\nLa\nP\nCe\nPr\nNd\nZr\nHf\nSm\nEu\nGd\nTi\nTb\nDy\nY\nHo\nEr\nTm\nYb\nLu\n\nincreasing\xc2\xa0incompatibility\n\nFigure 1.

Coupled anomalies\nin P, Sr, Zr and Hf (Fig. 1) suggest that these elements\nare dominated by a common phase. Majorite garnet\nwas suggested to be the phase responsible for anomalous P behavior [9]. The majorite/melt Kd for P is ~1\nfor Earth-relevant compositions at appropriate pressures [10], but Kds for Zr and Hf are much less [11],\nsuggesting that the anomalies in P, Zr and Hf may not\nhave resulted solely from majorite accumulation.\nThe lowermost mantle is predicted to contain Mgsilicate perovskite [12]. This phase has Zr and Hf Kds\n>1, but its P and Sr Kds are less than unity [13]. Thus,\nwhile accumulation of Mg-silicate perovskite may\nhave caused the Zr and Hf anomalies, it cannot also\nexplain the P and Sr anomalies.\nMartian clinopyroxenites were also derived from\nlight REE-depleted sources [e.g. 14], consistent with\nmajorite garnet accumulation. Zirconium and Hf abundances suggest that the clinopyroxenite source region\naccumulated later (and higher), possibly after cessation\nof Mg-silicate perovskite crystallization.\nWe will run magma ocean models incorporating\ntrace element partition coefficients \xc3\xa0 la [1] to test the\nhypotheses for the generation of trace element anomalies discussed here, constrained to match growth of\nradiogenic isotope ratios.\nReferences: [1] Elkins-Tanton L.
