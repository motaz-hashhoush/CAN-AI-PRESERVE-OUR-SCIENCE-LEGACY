White on the determination\nof water quality parameters using visible-region sensors;\n\n3\n\nof\nby K.R. Moore on the feasibility of remote determination\nwildlife habitat in Texas; by R.H. Haas and D.W. Deering on\nthe correlation of spectral band ratios to vegetation development; by J.A. Schell on techniques for processing ERTS-1\nMSS data; by F.J. Bruns on development of a low-cost color\ndigital image display system; by R.W. Toler and W.C. Odle on\nremote measurements of vegetation stress; by J.A. Permenter\nand W.C. Nordhaus on development of a real-time signal\nprocessor and classifier for radar sensing of Arctic ice;\nby G.J. Wilhelmi on formulation of a model for volume\nscattering of electromagnetic energy from rough surfaces;\nby C.L. Kroll and T.G. Sibley on passive microwave sensing\nof soil moisture in the presence of vegetation; and by\nW.T. Mayo and T.C. Sheives on preliminary development of\na laser sensor for oil spill detection.\nThis report contains a summary of each research\narea with reference to technical reports detailing the recent\nresults.\n\nThe documentations contained in this report does\n\nnot encompass the whole of the Remote Sensing Center program,\nbut it emphasizes the major projects.\n\nIn previous annual\n\nreports the appendix included copies of many of the technical\nreports relating to the project activity, however the volume\nof the 1972-73 material exceeds the level where this is\nstill practical.\n\nConsequently, the appendices consist\n\nprimarily of the abstracts or summaries of these reports,\nand a complete listing of the current publications is\nincluded in Section VII.\n\nII.\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nThe Remote Sensing Center is a consortium of\nfour colleges of Texas AGM University:\nEngineering, Geosciences and Science.\n\nAgriculture,\nBecause of this\n\nunique organization, the Center has been successful in\nestablishing workable intercollege projects.\n\nAdminis-\n\ntratively the Center was formed as a division of the\nTexas Engineering Experiment Station.\n\nHowever, because\n\nof the growth of its agricultural applications effort,\nthe Center has also been designated a division of the\nTexas Agricultural Experiment Station.\n\nThis added\n\ndimension to the administrative structure enables the\nCenter to interface more effectively with agriculturists\nthroughout Texas.\nThe Center is structured into seven laboratories.\nFour of these are devoted primarily to applications projects\nand three provide the supporting technology.\nare:\n\nThe laboratories\n\nVegetation Systems Laboratory, headed by Dr. R.H. Haas;\n\nPlant Protection Laboratory, headed by Dr. R.W. Toler; Data\nAnalysis Laboratory, headed by J.A. Schell; Electro-optical\nSystems Laboratory, headed by Dr. W.T. Mayo; Environmental\nMonitoring Laboratory, headed by Dr. W.P. James; Space\nOceanography Laboratory headed by Dr. G.L. Huebner; and\nMicrowave and Infrared Systems Laboratory, headed by Dr. J.W.\nRouse, Director of the Center.\n\n6\n\nIII.\n\nPROGRAM DEVELOPMENT\nThe orientation and emphasis of the Remote Sensing\n\nCenter program are strongly influenced by the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration as expressed in the\ngoals of NASA Grant NGL 44-001-001, which provides the\nbasic support for major segments of this work.\n\nMany of\n\nthe contract supported studies are a direct result of\nactivities initiated under this grant program, consequently\nthe grant activities form an integral part of the overall\nprogram.\n\nPrior to 1973, the grant activities tended toward\n\nfundamental research in sensor technology and data analysis.\nThis emphasis is evident in previous Annual Summaries.\nThis year the emphasis was redirected to concentrate on\napplications of remote sensing techniques, and the work in\nthe Center this year reflects this new direction.\n\nThis\n\nreorientation was well suited to the multidisciplinary\nstructure of the Remote Sensing Center, which was established\nspecifically for the purpose of adapting these new techniques to resource monitoring problems in Texas.\n\nIn\n\naddition, it promoted utilization of a wider range of the\nUniversity\'s earth scientists.\n\nAs a direct result of the\n\n1973 reorientation, the Center increased the personnel in\nthe applications groups, particularly the Vegetation Systems\n\n7\n\nLaboratory.\n\nThe number of full-time professionals was\n\nincreased, and the previous predominance of master degree\nlevel graduate students was changed to a predominance of\ndoctoral level graduate students.\nDuring this year, several application-oriented\nprojects, called Action Projects, have been established in\ncooperation with state and/or federal agencies in which a\nvariety of remote sensing techniques are being applied.\nAmong these Action Projects are:\nLand Resource Management - A cooperative project\namong USDA Soil Conservation Service (SCS), Texas Agricultural\nExperiment Station, and Remote Sensing Ceter was initiated\nto evaluate remote sensing to assist in land resource management.\n\nThe feasibility and cost effectiveness of applying\n\nremote sensing techniques to aid in land resource inventory\ntasks performed by the SCS:\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\nupdating soil surveys,\n\nconducting "Conservation Needs Inventory" and (3) other\n\ntypes of inventories associated with land resource menagement\nare being determined.\n\nNASA/JSC obtained aerial photography\n\nof Brazos County during May 1973 in support of this project.\nAdditional flights are scheduled for late 1973 and mid-1974.\nSCS personnel from the Temple, Texas office have been assigned\nto the project to participate in a training program and the\ncollection of ground data.\n\nPhase I of this cooperative\n\n8\n\nproject has been completed and Phase II\n\n(field data col-\n\nlection) is currently in progress.\n\nCotton Insects - This is a cooperative project\nbetween USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and\nRemote Sensing Center personnel to obtain synoptic information needed in the state-wide effort to control the\nadvance of the bollworm and boll weevel in Texas.\n\nControl\n\nof cotton insects is a matter of enormous economic significance in Texas.\n\nThe ARS is conducting a pilot project\n\nof Frio County, Texas to determine insect population\ndynamics and effective eradication methods.\n\nIt has been\n\ndetermined that timely agricultural land use data are\nextremely important for effective use of the inventory\nand control techniques.\n\nAirborne and ERTS-1 data have\n\nbeen acquired for Frio County.\n\nThe ERTS-1 data are being\n\ncomputer processed to isolate and identify crop types,\nlocation, and acreages.\nCoastal Dredging - This is a cooperative project\namong U.S. Corps of Engineers, Civil Engineering Department, and Remote Sensing Center personnel to quantify the\nimpact of dredging activities in Galveston Bay.\n\nThe\n\nproject was initiated as a ground-based study for the Corps\nof Engineers.\n\nThe Center has offered to acquire and analyze\n\n9\n\nremote sensing data as a compliment to the ongoing effort\nso as to determine the utility and cost effectiveness of\nremote sensing techniques in this application.\n\nERTS-1\n\ndata have been acquired and several overflights by the\nTexas AGM University photo-equipped aircraft have been\nconducted.\nCrop Diseases - A cooperative effort among the\nTexas Department of Agriculture (Quarantine Division),\nTexas Agricultural Experiment Station, and Remote Sensing\nCenter personnel has been established to apply aerial\ninventorying methods in the assessment of select crop\ndiseases.\n\nThe initial effort is concentrating on a virus\n\nof St. Augustinegrass, which is presently under strict\nquarantine in Texas.\n\nThis commercial crop is normally\n\nsurveyed manually by Texas Department of Agriculture\npersonnel at considerable cost.\n\nPreliminary tests confirm\n\nthat an appreciable saving in time and money can be realized\nusing a multi-band aerial photogarphic method in lieu of\nmanual inspections.\n\nExtension of the techniques to moni-\n\ntoring wheat and sorghum are under investigation.\nUrban Planning and Land Use - This project is an\nexpansion of the Woodlands Project being conducted by the\nCenter for Mitchell Associates in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe\n\n10\n\nexpanded project is being formulated as a cooperative\neffort with the Texas Real Estate Institute, Department\nof Agricultural Economics, and the College of Agriculture.\nInitial plans have been formulated along the lines of the\nCornell University land use inventory for New York.\n\nThis\n\noverall project area.is associated with activities of the\nnewly formed Interagency Council on National Resources\nand Environment recently established in Texas by Governor\nBriscoe.\n\nThis council has a Remote Sensing Task Force\n\nas a subgroup which includes Remote Sensing Center personnel\nin its membership.\n\nThis state-wide effort is similar to\n\nthe Arizona activity and is being encouraged by NASA.\n\nIV.\n\nAPPLICATIONS\nA.\n\nVegetation Systems\nThe Vegetation Systems Laboratory in the Remote\n\nSensing Center was established in 1972, to coordinate remote sensing investigations related to the use of renewable\nnatural resources.\n\nThis laboratory under the direction of\n\nDr. R.H. Haas, Associate Professor in Range Science, has\nexpanded its program during this year to include a wide\nvariety of application oriented studies.\n\nThis applications\n\noriented program is a joint effort of Texas Agricultural\nExperiment Station personnel working with the Remote Sensing\nCenter.\n\nThe broad program currently underway includes:\n\ninvestigations on the use of remote sensing for rangeland\nresource management, wildlife habitat analysis, monitoring\nnatural vegetation in conjunction with urban development,\nand a program for monitoring seasonal reflectance on a wide\nvariety of rangeland species.\nTwo important cooperative programs were initiated\nin 1973 which include:\n\n1) a program with the Soil Conser-\n\nvation Service, USDA on "Remote Sensing for Land Resource\nManagement" and 2) a project with the Agricultural Research\nService, USDA, on the effective use of remote sensing techniques for crop condition analysis in conjunction with\n\n12\n\ncotton insect control programs.\nThere continues to be an urgency for adapting\npresently available remote sensing technology for use on\nagriculture and natural lands of Texas and the nation.\nApplications programs of the Vegetation Systems Laboratory\nare designed to interface the highly sophisticated technology of remote sensing with practical problems in several activity areas.\nLand Resource Management - A phased program was\ninitiated in 1973 to evaluate selected remote sensing applications for land resource management.\n\nAn interdisci-\n\nplinary team composed of scientific personnel from Texas\nAGM University, and technical personnel from the Soil\nConservation Service, USDA, are cooperating to determine\nthe feasibility and cost-effectiveness of certain land\ninventories using small scale color-IR aerial photography\nand ERTS-1 imagery for Brazos County, Texas.\n\nA formal\n\nagreement which activated Phases I and II of this program\nis detailed in the "Memorandum of Understanding between the\nSoil Conservation Service, USDA, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, and Remote Sensing Center, Texas A&M University".\n\n13\n\nThree tasks are being accomplished by the inter-\n\ndisciplinary team:\n1) A study of the relationship between the\nexisting soil survey of Brazos County and interpretations\nmade from color-IR imagery and other remote sensing techniques.\n\nRecommendations will be made as to improvements\n\nthat can be made in the soil survey program by the use of\nmodern remote sensing technology.\n2) An evaluation of color-IR imagery and other\nremote sensing techniques against conventional methods for\nconducting a Conservation Needs Inventory (CNI) for Brazos\nCounty.\n\nRecommendations are to be made for improvements\n\nthat will expedite collection of CNI data.\n3)\n\nDevelopment of survey techniques for con-\n\nducting a wildlife habitat survey on a county-wide basis\nusing small scale imagery.\nA phased approach is being employed to expedite\nthe allocation of manpower and resources for conducting\nseveral tasks under this investigation.\n\nPhase I was con-\n\ncerned with the initial assessment of color-IR aerial photography with respect to feasibility of completing proposed tasks.\nResults of June and August, 1973 meetings of RSC-SCS personnel indicated that high quality color-IR aerial photog-\n\nIIS\n\nWorking group consisting of Remote Sensing Center and Soil Conservation Service Personnel\n\nEvaluating aerial photography for deZineating ground sampling sites\n\n14\n\nraphy at medium to small scales held great potential for\ncompleting the outlined tasks.\n\nPlans were subsequently\n\nformulated for manpower and financial allocations with\nrespect to implementing Phase II of the program.\n\nA detailed\n\n"Workplan Outline" covering the implementation of the Phase\nII program was prepared as a part of the Phase I activity.\nEmphasis of the Phase II program currently underway is given to field data collection and assessment of\nNASA obtained aerial photography (1:40,000) taken in late\nSeptember, 1973.\n\nColor aerial photography (1:8,000) was\n\nacquired to provide training aids and base maps for field\nsurveys at twenty-four 160-acre sampling sites located\nthroughout Brazos County.\n\nField data was collected by\n\nthree "task force" teams during the week of October 9-12\nby visiting selected sites and employing appropriate ground\ndata sampling methods.\n\nA reference document, "Guidelines\n\nfor Coding Resource and Land Use Data", was prepared to\nstandardize data collection for anticipated computer data\nsummarization.\nGround observations were made of type and condition of land resources and land use at the selected sites.\nLand classification delineations were inscribed on photographic overlays to be used as training samples for photo\n\ninterpretations made from Fall 1973 color-IR aerial photography in a November training session.\n\nAdverse weather pre-\n\nvented completion of field surveys, consequently this part\nof Phase II will be accomplished at the November meeting.\nOne part of Task 3 under Phase II has been completed.\n\nAn index of interspersion, intended to reflect\n\nhabitat potential for white-tailed deer, has been completed\nfor the selected sampling sites.\n\nThe number of vegetation\n\ntype changes have been recorded in sampling blocks throughout the county.\n\nInterspersion data were acquired along two\n\ndiagonal lines 0.7 miles long.\n\nThis parameter will be used\n\nas a standard for comparison with other methods for collecting habitat data.\nPhase III priorities resulting from Phase I recommendations will be conducted for the entire county.\n\nEmphasis\n\nwould be given in Phase IV to evaluating the potential use\nof ERTS-1 satellite data for performing or enhancing the\ntask completed in Phase III.\nWhen all phases of the program are completed for\nthe several outlined tasks, the following accomplishments\nare anticipated:\n1.\n\nAn assessment of the potential use of small-\n\nscale, advanced aerial photography for performing the out-\n\n16\n\nlined task (i.e. Soils Survey, Conservation Needs Inventory,\nWildlife Habitat Survey).\n2. Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of using\nadvanced aerial photography along with improved photo interpretation techniques for the assessment of land resource\nparameters.\n3. A prototype approach which can serve as an\nexample for further cooperative efforts and the application\nof remote sensing to other aspects of land resource management.\n4. A list of items needing further research to\naid in the development of the remote sensing applications.\nCotton Insects - This is a cooperative project\nbetween Agricultural Research Service, USDA, and Remote\nSensing Center personnel to obtain synoptic information\nneeded in the state-wide effort to control the advance of\nthe bollworm and boll weevil in Texas.\n\nControl of cotton\n\ninsects is a matter of enormous economic significance in\nTexas.\n\nARS/USDA is conducting a pilot project in Frio\n\nCounty, Texas to determine insect population dynamics and\neffective eradication methods.\n\nIt has been determined that\n\ntimely agricultural land use data are extremely important\nfor effective use of the insect inventory and eradication\n\n17\n\ntechniques.\n\nAirborne and ERTS-1 data have been acquired for\n\nFrio County test sites in 1973.\n\nThe ERTS-1 data are being\n\ncomputer processed to isolate and identify crop locations,\ntype, and acreages.\nUrban Planning and Land Use - A cooperative agreement with George Mitchell Associates on the "Use of LargeScale Aerial Photography in Urban Planning" was continued\nin 1973.\n\nThe purpose of this study (The Woodlands Project)\n\nhas been to determine the kinds of information that can be\nextracted from advanced types of imagery for site planning.\nResults from the initial phase of the study suggested that\na systematic grid sampling technique maximized the information\nobtainable from high quality, large-scale color-IR aerial\nphotography.\nIn 1973 the grid sampling procedures were employed\nto extract specific information about the forest vegetation\nfor an area of approximately 7,000 acres.\n\nParameters are\n\nidentified by Texas Grid System coordinates for 0.9 acre\nblocks.\n\nAll data are assembled in a computer compatible\n\nformat, summarized and grid system grey maps of the vegetation, terrain and soil features produced.\nVegetation maps including canopy area by forest\ntype, species composition, tree height, and the location of\n\n18\n\nsuperior trees are currently being employed by Wallace,\nMcHarg, Roberts and Todd, contractors for site planning.\nThree types of mapping from the color-IR imagery was found\nto be of expedient use:\n\n1) Stratification maps of general\n\nforest types with legend descriptions for land planning;\n2) grid system maps of specific forest features for\ngeneral site planning; and 3)\n\ndetailed maps of critical\n\nplant communities for detailed site planning.\nThis program is currently being expanded to include\nthe development of a monitoring system that would accurately\nmeasure the environmental alterations imposed by the urban\ndevelopment process.\n\nColor-IR aerial photography and other\n\nsensorswill be employed to periodically survey the 18,000\nacre development site to record changes in natural vegetation\nand to analyze the impact of urbanization on the natural environment.\n\nThese studies will incorporate investigations\n\ninto the feasibility of automatic data assembly and computer\nanalysis.\nA cooperative endeavor with the College of Architecture has been established to aid in determining the essential parameters in application of remote sensing to urban\nplanning.\n\nMr. Jack Wolfe, Department of Urban Planning, was\n\nemployed in September, 1973, to assist in this function.\n\n19\n\nCurrently an exhaustive annotated bibliography on "Remote\nSensing Applied to Urban Planning" is being prepared.\n\nThis\n\nresearch will investigate the application of remote sensing\nto site planning.\nIn consort with the expansion of the Woodlands\nProject, a cooperative endeavor is being formulated with the\nTexas Real Estate Institute, Department of Agricultural\nEconomics, and the College of Agriculture.\n\nInitial plans\n\nhave been formulated along the lines of the Cornell University land use inventory for New York.\n\nThis overall project\n\narea is associated with activities of the newly formed Interagency Council on National Resources and Environment recently\nestablished in Texas by Governor Briscoe.\n\nThis council has\n\na Remote Sensing Task Force as a subgroup which includes\nRemote Sensing Center personnel in its membership.\n\nThis\n\nstate-wide effort is similar to the Arizona activity and is\nbeing encouraged by NASA.\nWildlife Habitat Studies - A study by Mr. Kenneth\nMoore was completed in 1973 on the "Remote detection of Deer\nHabitat Factors".\n\nThe investigation conducted at the Sonora\n\nRange Research Station near Sonora, Texas, evaluated the\nuse of aerial photography for:\n\n1)\n\nextracting vegetation\n\nparameters useful for habitat analyses, 2)\n\nquantifying\n\nIE\nIApo\n\nI4\n\n,it\n\nC4\n\n~O\n00\no00\n\n...

Texas AGM University is conducting an ERTS-1 regional\n\n21\n\nstudy in which the vernal advancement and retrogradation\nof natural vegetation (green wave effect) is monitored using\nERTS observations throughout the Great Plains Corridor of the\ncentral United States.\n\nThe green wave effect is being\n\ncharted by employing the relatively homogeneous rangeland\nvegetation systems of the extensive Mixed Prairie as phenological indicators.\n\nERTS multispectral data and ground obser-\n\nvations collected from a network of ten test sites are used\nto measure vegetation change during the lifetime of ERTS-1.\nAttention is given to observing seasonal drought and other\nbioclimatic influences which impact on management and production in agriculture.\n\nThe overall objective of the investiga-\n\ntion is to determine the effectiveness of ERTS-type data for\nmonitoring the vegetation conditions of direct concern to\nrangeland management and agri-business decisions in the\nGreat Plains.\nA network of ten test sites have been established\nwithin the Great Plains, extending from south Texas through\nNorth Dakota within the Mixed Prairie region.\n\nEach site is\n\nan established rangeland study area of a state agricultural\nexperiment station or the USDA, and each is monitored by\nexperienced rangeland specialists.\n\nThe periodic data col-\n\nlected in conjunction with each satellite overpass consists\n\nTest Site Listing - North to South\n\nSHays,\n\nMandan, South Dakota\nCottonwood, South Dakota\nSand Hills, Nebraska\nYansas\nWoodward, Oklahoma\nChickasha, Oklahoma\nThrockmorton, Texas\nSanora, Texas\nCollege Station, Texas\nWes laco, Texas\n\nGreat Plains Corridor and test site network\n\n22\n\nof photographs of selected subsites, weather information,\npercentage green vegetation, standing plant biomass, percentage plant moisture, visually dominant species, and\nphenology of dominant species.\n\nThese measurements are\n\ncompiled and computer processed to form continuously updated site data summary reports graphically portraying\nthe progression of the green wave effect for direct comparison with the ERTS data analysis results.\n\nThe ground\n\nobservations acquired to date have documented the annual\nphases of the vegetation throughout the Great Plains\nCorridor.\nAnalyses of black and white imagery suggests that\ndetail in vegetation patterns is much greater than originally anticipated.\n\nA preliminary analysis of single band\n\nimagery and digital data at locations in the Great Plains\nCorridor show that woodland, grassland, and cropland areas\nare easily delineated.\n\nComputer derived grey-scale maps\n\nfrom MSS digital data are useful in identifying terrestrial\nfeatures as well as patterns of natural and cultivated lands\nwhich are important in site locations.\n\nSingle band imagery\n\nand digital data have important application for synoptic land\nuse mapping and inventory.\nEvaluations of multiband (color composite) imagery\nshows the expected enhancement of detail and information\n\n23\n\ncontent of ERTS MSS data.\n\nThe use of multiband imagery\n\ngreatly improves the value of MSS imagery for applications\nrequiring synoptic land use mapping.\n\nFirst order evalua-\n\ntions of vegetation condition and condition changes are\npossible using color composite imagery.\n\nQuality control\n\nin processing of the color composites limits these imagery\nfor quantitative determinations.\nStatistical evaluation of MSS digital data\nsuggest that the coefficient of variation (CV) for Band 5\nmean reflectance data is useful in determining the homogeneity of a vegetative scene.\n\nCV\'s ranged from about\n\n5% for uniform grassland to more than 20% for woodlandgrassland areas with variable ground cover.\n\nThe relatively\n\nlow CV value for a unifrom scene appears also to be indicative of a desirable signal-to-noise ratio, enhancing the\npotential usefulness of the data for quantitative "signature" analysis.\nInitial ratio analysis, using Band 5 and Band 7\ndata, suggests the applicability of these data for the detection of temporal changes in the "greenness" of a vegetative scene.\n\nThe Transformed Vegetation Index (TVI)\n\nderived from the Band 5 and Band 7 data, is well correlated\nwith yield of above\n\nround green biomass, which is an indicator\n\n24\n\nof range forage conditions.\n\nSignificant shifts in\n\ntotal reflectance from Fall to Winter and from Winter to\nSpring are an apparent result of a changed solar angle\nand indicates the necessity of data normalization if used\nwithout correction.\nmented and tested.\n\nA solar-angle model has been impleAll digital data are currently cor-\n\nrected for solar angle declination.\nThe Great Plains Corridor study has shown significant progress toward realization of an information source\ndirectly applicable to preparing range forage condition\nindexes and reports on seasonal development supportive of\nrangeland and dryland farming activities:\n\nRegionalization\n\nof this investigation would provide a unique opportunity to\nassess the usefulness of ERTS parameters to the important\nlivestock industries of the Great Plains states.\nThe Texas A&M University involvement in this\nproject and in the ERTS Phenology Satellite Experiment has\nbecome well known throughout Texas.\n\nThis fact, coupled with\n\nthe published information that the Remote Sensing Center maintains a NOAA Browse File of ERTS-1 data, has led to several\ninstances where various users have sought assistance in\nemploying ERTS-1 measurements.\n\n25\n\n2)\n\nField Signature Acquisition - During the\n\nperiod of this report a cooperative effort was established\nwith NASA/JSC to obtain field signatures of rangeland\nspecies using the Field Signature Acquisition System (FSAS).\nGrass reflectance characteristics of rangeland vegetation\nscenes were obtained at test site locations near College\nStation during the 1973 growing season.\n\nThe measurements\n\nwill serve to evaluate the temporal reflectance changes for\nrangeland vegetation.\nThe primary objective of this endeavor is fundamental information about the reflectance characteristics of\nnatural vegetation.\n\nTwo studies are underway to obtain\n\ninformation on: a) the simulated grazing effect, and b) the\nintegration of reflectance components for a grassland community.\n\nField plots were established and initial data collected.\n\nPeriodic measurements were made during the 1973 growing\nseason to characterize the phenophase dependent vegetation\nchanges.\n\nData reduction and analyses are currently underway.\n3)\n\nMonitoring Rangeland Improvement - A\n\ncooperative project between the Range Science Department and\nTexas A&M University Research and Extension Center at\nChillocothe-Vernon was initiated in 1973 to monitor ecological changes following the control of mesquite.\n\nMesquite\n\nMeasurements of control ed range\nsites using the NASA/JSC Visible\nInfrared Interferometer Spectrometer\n\nObtaining ground truth of the\ncontrolled range sites during\nvisible and near IR reflectance\nmeasurements\n\n26\n\nis a noxious woody plant that plagues much of the ranching\nindustry of Texas and the southwest USA.\n\nThis project is\n\nfunded in part by a grant from the Waggoner Ranch Estate.\nRemote sensing is being applied in:\n\na) monitoring\n\nthe impact of different brush control treatments on patterns\nof vegetation succession, and b) determining the effective\nduration and economic benefits of alternative brush control\nmethods.\n\nThe primary goal of this investigation is to obtain\n\na basic understanding of the cost-effectiveness of different\nbrush control methods for rangeland production.\nB.\n\nEnvironmental Monitoring\nThe primary emphasis of the Environmental Monito-\n\nring Laboratory program is on the application of remote\nsensing techniques to water quality determination.\n\nThis\n\nconcentration on water quality is supportive of several\nrelated programs at Texas AGM University, including the Sea\nGrant Program, Water Resources Institute, the Environmental\nEngineering Division of Civil Engineering, among others.\nThe program has been structured to concentrate\non two application areas.\n\nThe first area relates to the\n\nFederal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, specifically\nthe Clean Lakes Section.\n\nThis work is supportive of Texas\n\n27\n\nWater Quality Board activities.\n\nThe second area deals with\n\nthe environmental impact of dredging and other sediment disturbances along the Texas coast.\n\nThis work is supportive\n\nof Corps of Engineers activities.\nFresh Water Lakes Project - The Federal Water\nPollution Control Act requires that the states classify all\nof their publicly owned lakes according to eutropic condition.\n\nTexas has 2200 square miles of bays and estuaries,\n\n80,000 miles of rivers and streams, and over 200 lakes.\nThe extensive task of examining these waterways is the\nresponsibility of the Texas Water Quality Board.\n\nThe\n\nobjective of this Remote Sensing Center project is to\ndevelop remote sensing techniques capable of rapid, synoptic determination of turbidity and chlorophyll content of\nfresh water lakes.\nThe project consists of two phases, each including several tasks.\n\nThe first phase involves a field test\n\nprogram to assist in development of an effective means of\ndetermining the eutropic condition of lakes.\n\nThe second\n\nphase deals with the acquisition and analysis of ERTS-1\nMSS data for fresh water bodies in Texas.\nAs part of the first phase effort, six lakes in\nthe College Station, Texas area have been under examination\nfor over a year.\n\nThe lakes provide a wide range of turbidity\n\nCOLOR IR\n\nCOLOR\n\nColor IR and noramZ photography of three of the six test ponds each\nwith different turbidity. Density differences between the photograph pairs indicate variations in turbidity between the ponds.\nNumbers correspond to ground sampling points.\n\n28\n\nlevels\n\n(5-340 JTUJ)\n\nand chlorophyll conditions.\n\nAn air-\n\nborne multi-band camera system was employed for remote\nmonitoring of the lakes.\n\nThis sensing technique was se-\n\nlected because it offers the most versatile approach consistent with the needs of the Texas Water Quality Board\nfor a low-cost, simple monitoring system.\ncameras were used for the initial study.\nemployed two 70 mm Hasselblad cameras.\n\nThree 35 mm\nLater studies\n\nAll photography\n\nwas recorded at oblique angles to reduce the effect of\nspecular scatter due to direct solar radiation.\nA series of 14 flights over the six lakes was\nEach overflight was accompanied by a ground\n\nconducted.\n\nteam that collected water samples for laboratory analysis\nof turbidity and chlorophyll.\n\nThe photographic films were\n\nanalyzed by recording the film densities using a Macbeth\ndensitometer\n\n(Model TD-504) in each of the spectral bands\n\nobtained.\nThe results established that turbidity levels\ncould be measured remotely with a high degree of accuracy.\nThe optimum procedure was found to be the use of two different film-filter combinations on two ranges of turbidity.\nThat is,\n\nrelatively clear lakes having turbidity measure-\n\nments of 35 JTU or less, required a different technique than\nfor highly turbid water, to obtain good measurement accuracy.\n\n29\n\nThe optimum sensor response to turbidity was found to occur\nin the red band of color infrared film for highly turbid\nlakes, and in the green band of normal color film for\nrelatively clear lakes.\n\nThe data indicate that the fol-\n\nlowing relationship existed between film density readings\nand turbidity:\nT = a\n\n+ al (Y)\n\nwhere:\nT = turbidity level (JTU units)\ny = corrected film density\nao, al = constants\n\nThe corrected film density, y, is the density of the red\nband or green band, depending upon the turbidity range,\nreferenced to a "gray" calibration card.\na\n\nThe constants,\n\nand al, are determined from a linear least square anal-\n\nysis of the data.\n\nA stepwise regression analysis was\n\nutilized to determine the correlation coefficients relating\nfilm density and turbidity.\n\nThe results indicate a 0.975\n\ncorrelation for turbidity levels above 35 JTU, and 0.922\nfor levels below 35 JTU.\nThe procedure employed in an attempt to measure\nchlorophyll content was to measure the reflectance of the\n\n30\n\nlakes in two spectral bands using panchromatic film.\n\nThe\n\nbands selected represented the regions of maximum and minimum absorption of light by chlorophyll.\n\nThe initial results\n\nof this work were unsatisfactory, primarily because of the\nmasking effect of the total turbidity of the lakes.\n\nThe\n\nlakes used for the study exhibited a high turbidity to\nchlorophyll content ratio, hence, were not ideal for such\ntesting.\n\nThe activity will be continued using narrower\n\npassband filters and lakes exhibiting a wider range of\nchlorophyll concentrations.\nThe second phase of the study has resulted in\nthe acquisition of ERTS-1 MSS images for major segments of\nTexas and the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nInitial analysis of the\n\nMSS CCT data indicates sensitivity to the varying optical\nproperties of the lakes due to differing color, turbidity,\nand chlorophyll concentrations.\n\nThe data are being used to\n\nclassify the lakes in Texas according to their ERTS-1 spectral reflectance parameters and to relate these classes to\nthe characteristics of the lakes, including flushing rates,\ninflow waters, and drainage basin parameters.\nCoastal Waters Project - The Texas Gulf Coast\nincludes almost 2000 miles of shoreline extending from the\nSabine River on the east to the Rio Grande River on the\n\n31\n\nsouth.\n\nAbout 1500 miles of this coastline fronts on bays\n\nand estuaries which possess dynamic water properties as a\nresult of human activities.\n\nThis project deals with two\n\nbroad areas of concern in the coastal zone:\n\n(1) industrial\n\nand waste water pollution of the bays and estuaries, with\nparticular emphasis on biological effects; and (2) natural\nand induced sediment movement.\nThe sediment problem is one of major economic\nconcern because of the need to conduct extensive dredging\nactivities in the area of the Texas Coast shipping ports.\nDuring any single year, it is necessary to dredge over a\n150 million cubic yards of material to maintain navigable\nchannel depths for shipping.\n\nDredging is conducted exten-\n\nsively for sand and gravel mining and for land fill associated with urban shoreline development.\n\nOver 1000 million\n\ntons of material are dredged each year for these purposes.\nAll dredging activities effect the natural environment to some degree, and recent public reaction to this\npotential threat to ecological balances has forced discontinuation of several major dredging projects along the Texas\ncoast.\n\nThe environmental problem arises from the fact that\n\nthe material that drifts away from the dredge site constitutes a waste discharge having adverse effects on water\nquality.\n\nThe extent and severity of this effect is deter-\n\n*\n\nI\nI\nI\nU\nI\n44\n\nI\n\n1ar\n\nI\nI\nSediment generated by dredging operations in Galveston Bay\n\nI\nU\nU\n\nI\n\n32\n\nmined by a number of factors, including local wave, wind,\nand current conditions.\nThe objectives of this study are to document the\nphysical changes that take place in the dredge spoil disposal areas in Galveston Bay due to environmental forces,\nand to develop the aerial photographic methodology for\nmonitoring dredge spoil disposal methods.\n\nThis study is\n\na joint project conducted in cooperation with an ongoing\nSea Grant Project called "A Study of Dredge Spoil Dispersion\nin Galveston Bay", and the Corps of Engineers.\n\nResults of\n\nthis study are necessary to assess the contribution that\nspoil disposal areas have on the pollution load in an estuarine system.\nThis study is a logical extension of the fresh\nwater lakes projects in that nearly the same procedures\ncan be utilized to estimate the turbidity levels above\nambient.\n\nThe Remote Sensing Center has conducted four\n\nphotographic flights over Galveston Bay dredge spoil disposal sites.\n\nThese flights were flown to determine the\n\ncurrent velocities and dispersion coefficients from dye\nreleases in the disposal area.\n\nThe photography was taken\n\nwith two Hasselblad cameras and a mapping camera using\ncolor, color IR, and black and white film.\n\nThe areas\n\nof influence and turbidity levels can be accurately mapped\n\nModified DeHavi and\nBeaver and partial\ncamera package\n\nTexas A&M University\nboat used to obtain\nwater samples\n\nI\n\n33\n\nfrom this photography.\nIndustrial and waste water pollution is a serious\nproblem in Texas bays and estuaries.\n\nIn addition to pollu-\n\ntants carried into these areas by fresh water streams, the\ncoastal bays and estuaries tend to attract industrial activity and population centers, along with their resulting\nwaste products.\n\nThis complex system is often the most bio-\n\nlogical variable and most productive area in the marine\nenvironment.\nAs the population and industrial development\nincrease, the degree of waste treatment, and control over\nwaste disposal practices must also increase in order to\nmaintain the environment quality at an acceptable level.\nAlong the Texas coast, the Port Arthur complex, Houston,\nand Corpus Christi areas, particularly, show degradation\nof water quality.\nThe purpose of this study by the Remote Sensing\nCenter is to demonstrate to the Texas Water Quality Board\nhow remote sensing can be utilized to document and measure\nwater quality in the large estuarine systems along the Texas\nCoast.\n\nThe general appearance of the water can be perma-\n\nnently recorded and the color and turbidity quantitatively\nmeasured.\n\nThe amount and type of suspended and colloidal\n\nmaterial in the water column can change light scattering\n\n34\n\nand absorbing properties of the waterbody and in many cases\ncan be measured by remote methods.\n\nThe specific objective\n\nof this study is to relate the water quality parameters of\ncolor, light transmittance, and turbidity to aerial photographic and multispectral scanning imagery.\nTwo study sites were selected to include a full\nrange of water quality.\n\nThe sites were:\n\nGalveston Bay and\n\nHouston Ship Channel, and Corpus Christi Bay and Ship Channel.\nAn overflight of Galveston Bay was conducted in\nAugust, 1973 at 15,000 ft. using the NASA/JSC C130 B aircraft with the 24-channel digital scanner and two RC-8 cameras loaded with color and color IR film.\n\nAt the time of\n\nthe overflight a water quality survey vessel collected water\nsamples for laboratory measurement of turbidity, color, and\nlight transmittance.\n\nBecause of the problems involved in\n\ncoordinating the NASA aircraft and a ground truth boat during favorable weather conditions, the Corpus Christi Bay\nflight has not been completed.\n\nField studies have been\n\nattempted on three occasions but were not completed due to\nbad weather.\nUrban Planning Project - The Remote Sensing Center\nis cooperating in a study being conducted by personnel of\n\n35\n\nthe College of Architecture and Environmental Design.\n\nThe\n\nobjective of this study is to develop a comprehensive city\nplan for Madisonville, Texas.\n\nThe Madisonville Compre-\n\nhensive Plan will serve both as a model for the accomplishment of future plans and as a mechanism which will guide\nthe growth and development of the city of Madisonville\nover the next twenty years.\n\nThe key value of the work,\n\nhowever, is not the accomplishment of the plan but the\ninitiation of the process of planning in the city itself.\nIf this process can be established on a continuous basis,\nthen the study will have made a substantial contribution\ntoward the city\'s betterment.\nThe evaluation of the techniques being used in\naccomplishing the Madisonville Plan will form the basis for\nan analysis of the merit of the "701"\nthe Housing Act of 1954.\n\ntype plan outlined in\n\nThe use of the techniques of\n\nphotogrammetry and symapping will provide a basis for\nevaluating the usefulness of these tools for planning purposes.\nThe comprehensive city plan is a document which\nanalyzes the present condition of the city and projects its\nphysical, economic, social, and political future.\n\nThe plan\n\nis one of the by-products of an integrated community planning\nprocess.\n\nThe plan examines in detail the community\'s:\n\ngoals\n\n36\n\nand objectives, economic base and population characteristics,\nland use distribution, housing, circulation patterns and\ntransportation systems, community facilities and utilities,\ncapital and financial arrangements, and administrative controls.\nThere is in existence today a wide variety of comprehensive plans that have been prepared for cities across\nthe United States.\n\nMost of these plans have been prepared\n\nunder the "701" program of the Housing Act of 1954 and are\nsimilar in structure and content.\n\nThese plans can serve as\n\nguides for the accomplishment of new plans.\n\nAlong with\n\nthese guides are a number of new techniques and mechanisms\nwhich have not yet been extensively applied to the formulation of a comprehensive plan.\n\nSome of these which will be\n\nincorporated into the Madisonville Plan are:\n\na) computer\n\nmapping (symapping) - a technique for using the computer\nto construct maps\n\n(This case study will determine which of\n\nthe traditional planning maps may more quickly and clearly\nbe accomplished by symapping), b) photogrammetry - air photos\nwill be employed for a variety of uses, including, but not\nlimited to the analysis of:\n\nspatial distribution of struc-\n\ntures, geological interpretation of land suitability classes,\nand circulation patterns and traffic flow problems.\n\n37\n\nThe method of research that will be used in this\nstudy incorporates the following:\na)\n\nSynthesis of goals and objectives from community values,\n\nb)\n\nFormulation of community standards,\n\nc)\n\nAnalysis of opportunity and constraint areas,\n\nd)\n\nAdministration of questionnaires,\n\ne)\n\nAccomplishment of detailed land use, condition\nof structures and housing surveys, and\n\nf)\n\nEvaluation of the traditional planning methods\nof collecting data, analyzing results and\nformulating the conclusions and recommendations\nof the comprehensive plan.\n\nC.\n\nPlant Protection\nThe Plant Protection Laboratory program concen-\n\ntrates on remote sensing applications to disease management\nin crop production systems.\n\nThe emphasis is on virus dis-\n\neases, including Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus in corn, sorghum,\nand millet; Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus in wheat; Tungro and\nHojo Blanca Viruses in rice and barley, and Yellow Dwarf\n\n38\n\nVirus in barley, wheat, and oats.\n\nIn addition, plant stress\n\nconditions, such as moisture stress, are being examined to\ndetermine characteristic spectral reflectance properties.\nSt. Augustinegrass, a host for St. Augustine Decline (SAD) Virus, has been employed as a model virus-host\ncombination to study spectral reflectance properties in\norder to differentiate between healthy and infected plants\nusing remote sensing techniques.\n\nThis plant was selected\n\nfor these basic studies because it provides an ideal experimental model, and because St. Augustinegrass is a valuable\ncommercial crop in Texas which is presently under strict\nquarantine because of an outbreak of the SAD virus.\n\nField\n\ntesting has established a reliable remote monitoring method\nthat detects SAD in very early stages of development.\n\nThis\n\ntechnique was to have been implemented by the Texas Department of Agriculture (Quarantine Division) during the Spring\nof 1973 using NASA sensor aircraft.\n\nUnfortunately, the mis-\n\nsion could not be conducted, and an effort will be made to\nschedule the flights in 1974.\nThe primary activity during the 1972-73 period\nwas devoted to a study of the spectral reflectance characteristics of Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV) in sorghum.\nSorghum for grain and forage is one of the principal crops\nin Texas.\n\nOver nine million acres of grain sorghum were\n\n39\n\ngrown in the state in 1971.\n\nOne of the most important and\n\nlimiting diseases of this crop is caused by the Maize Dwarf\nMosaic Virus.\n\nThis virus is continuously present in the\n\nsorghum growing areas of the Southwest (Texas, Oklahoma,\nNew Mexico and Kansas).\n\nThe virus overwinters in rhizomes\n\nof Johnsongrass, a plant common in the Southwest that emerges\nprior to seeding the sorghum crop.\n\nThe disease is trans-\n\nmitted by some 13 species of aphids.\n\nThose concerned with\n\ncontrolling the disease need information on (1) its distribution and spread each year, (2) the disease intensity and\nestimated crop losses, and (3) effects on genetic material\nfor use in the commercial and university breeding programs.\nThis study was made to first determine in which\nspectral bands maximum reflectance differences occurred\namong healthy and MDMV-infected sorghum plants, preliminary\nto sensor designation for inventorying sorghum infections\nfrom the air.\n\nSecondly, the study was designed to develop\n\nan operational system for aerial detection and estimation\nof severity of MDMV in sorghum.\n\nThe research was a coop-\n\nerative effort of the Department of Plant Sciences and\nRemote Sensing Center and NASA/JSC, Applied Physics Branch.\nPlant material for laboratory and field studies\nemployed mechanically inoculated grain sorghum showing\nvarying levels of disease development.\n\nA randomized split\n\n40\n\nplot design was used in the field trials with healthy controls and MDMV diseased sorghum.\n\nThe plot size was 20 ft.\n\nx 20 ft. and all treatments were replicated four times.\nMechanical inoculations were made in the greenhouse and in\nthe field.\nData acquisition included measuring the spectral\nreflectance of samples in the laboratory using the Cary-14\nRI spectrophotometer.\n\nThe model-14 RI spectrophotometer is\n\ndesigned for automatic recording of energy in the wavelength\nregion of 225 nm to 3,000 nm with good resolving power and\nhigh photometric accuracy.\nImagery was obtained on flights during the growing\nseasons of 1972 and 1973 over the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station farm near College Station, Texas.\n\nFlight dates\n\nvaried because minimum weather conditions of less than 25%\ncloud cover and minimum haze had to be met for this photographic system to be functional.\n\nTime of sensing consis-\n\ntently was between 1100 and 1400 hr. (CDST).\n\nAltitudes used\n\nwere 300 M and 470 M above mean ground level.\n\nA Ziess RMK\n\nA 15/23 (9" x 9") camera equipped with a Ziess D (D525 nm)\ncutoff filter was mounted in a modified Dehaviland Beaver\naircraft which served as the sensing platform.\nSpectral reflectance data from the Cary-14 RI\nspectrophotometer showed spectral differences between heal-\n\n41\n\nthy and diseased sorghum.\n\nThese regions are centered on\n\n450 nm (blue), 525 nm (yellow), 650 nm (red) and 800 nm\n(infrared) regions.\nThe aerial imagery was collected 82 days after\nseeding.\n\nCalculation of areas of the fields in each di-\n\nsease rating improved disease severity estimates and predicted values when the densities were assessed to ratings\nof 1) healthy and vigorous 2) mosaic, slightly diseased\n3) mottled, all plants moderately diseased 4) mottled and\nredleaf and 5) severe redleaf and stunting.\n\nThese ranges\n\nare defined as signatures and were checked for accuracy\nagainst field disease ratings.\n\nDiseased sorghum was dif-\n\nferentiated from healthy sorghum in both 1972 and 1973.\nOnce disease signatures are determined, only spot ground\ntruth may be necessary.\n\nData should be collected as soon\n\nafter symptoms appear and before maturity, since symptoms\nbecome masked in sorghum as the plant approaches maturity.\n\n42\n\nV.\n\nSUPPORTING TECHNOLOGY\n\nApplied Data Analysis\n\nA.\n\nThe application of computer analysis of remote\nsensor measurements requires multilevel technique and\nsoftware development.\n\nThe first level of activity involves\n\nresearch into new analysis techniques or the development of\nexisting techniques to support and prove new applications.\nOnce techniques have been adequately defined and proven\nfor specific applications a second level of activity is\nrequired.\n\nThis level of activity provides for the develop-\n\nment of software/hardware systems which make the developed\ntechniques available for utilization by personnel technically\ntrained in computing operations.\n\nIt is also beneficial if\n\nthese users of the system are familiar with the specific\ntechniques involved.\n\nThis level of development is the\n\nclosest many techniques get to being operational and is\ngenerally "procedure development" for applications.\n\nThere is\n\nin addition, however, a third level of activity which is the\nmost applications oriented and ultimately the most beneficial.\n\nThis level of activity provides for the interface\n\nof the developed techniques and procedures into a user\noriented-facility for general applications use.\n\nIt is only\n\nafter this level of development that a technique can be\n\n43\n\nconsidered to be operational and can be integrated into\nspecific applications management programs.\nData Analysis projects are being conducted at\neach of these levels, however primary emphasis is placed\non achieving the last level, that of interfacing techniques\ndirectly with applications project personnel.\nArctic Ice Analysis - A significant study has\nrecently been concluded which has correlated NASA 13.3 GHz\nradar measurements to the age of Arctic ice.\n\nThe Arctic\n\nregion has recently attracted considerable attention\nbecause of its reserves of mineral resources.\n\nLess commonly\n\nknown, but more dramatic is the effect of the dynamics of\nthe sea ice in the Polar Basin on weather in the Northern\nHemisphere.\n\nThe macroscale heat flow patterns developed in\n\nthe Arctic due to polynyas and leads in the ice pack, and\ntheir movement, is reported to be a major driving function\nin the hemisphere\'s weather.\n\nThe Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint\n\nExperiment (AIDJEX), a multi-national research program in\nthe Arctic, is seeking to solve some of the unanswered\nquestions about ice dynamics and its meteorological significance, and ice age distribution is important in these\nconsiderations.\nThe Remote Sensing Center studies were conducted\nas part of a Naval Ordnance Laboratory supported project,\n\n44\n\n"Radar Studies of Arctic Ice and Development of a Realtime Arctic Ice Classification System".\n\nThis study has\n\nprovided a classical model for the application of remote\nsensor data analysis to a specific problem of concern.\nIt has involved the theoretical technique development\nrequired to provide the analysis tools; the techniques\nwere developed into a software package (SCATPGM) and\nspecific procedures were developed for analysis of the\nradar data; and finally a hardware system was developed\nincorporating the essential signal processing ingredients\non an operational level.\n\nAs a result of the systematic\n\napplication of SCATPGM to the radar data, significant\ncorrelations and signature relationship have been identified\nfor Arctic sea ice classes.\n\nAdditionally, hypothesis con-\n\ncerning the specific microwave scattering mechanisms involved\nhave been formulated and procedures for extension of this\nwork to other terrain types have been investigated.\nERTS-1 Phenology Study Support -\n\nA comprehensive\n\nanalysis package has been developed for operational handling\nof ERTS MSS data in support of phenology studies being conducted in the Great Plains, Rocky Mountain, and Columbia\nRiver Valley regions of the United States.\n\nOver twenty\n\nindividual test sites are involved, and processing of data\n\n45\n\ntaken over each of these sites for each ERTS overpass\nconstitutes a significant data handling problem.\n\nTo\n\nminimize the processing delay, specific analysis procedures have been developed and standardized for the\nproject.\nlatitude.\n\nThe test sites were located by longitude and\nWhen digital computer compatable tapes arrive\n\nfrom NASA for a test site, a 30 km square centered on the\ncalculated site location, is extracted from the digital\ntape and stored on high-speed disc storage.\ngrey-scale map of ERTS Band 5 is printed.\n\nA line printer\nThis is necessary\n\nsince the numerical resolution of satellite ground track\nprohibits a greater location accuracy than 3 km.\n\nFrom the\n\ngrey-scale printout, individual features are located and\ntest site tape coordinates are determined manually.\n\nThese\n\ncoordinates are entered, and the second phase of processing\nextracts signature mean and covariance information from the\nimage data within the site boundaries.. This information is\npresented in a site processing summary report and is also\nstored in a disc file for future reference.\n\nAdditional soft-\n\nware packages have been developed to reduce and graph ground\ndata samples collected at each test site.\nDue to the large inventory of ERTS imagery and\nmagnetic tapes required to be on hand, a computer cataloging\nprocedure was developed to enter and cross reference the\ndata.\n\nAn updated catelog is provided periodically referring\n\nLibrary of ERTS I data\ntapes containing imagery\nof the Great Plains Corridor\n\nI-:\nGray map printout of ERTS\nI data\n\nComparing ERTS I data of\nthe Great Plaine Carridor to aerial photography\n\n46\n\nall available ERTS data by ID number and site designation.\nOptimized Selection of Real-Time Classification\nProcessors - With the advent of modern digital technology\nand advanced development in the production of compact and\nmodular-sized computational units, the classification and\nanalysis of select remote sensor data in real-time became\nfeasible, and highly desirable in many cases.\n\nBecause of\n\nthe subjective nature of the classification problem, numerous classification algorithms and techniques can be applied\nto solve a given problem.\n\nThe digital realization of various\n\ntypes of classification algorithms requires differing degrees\nof complexity and computation power.\n\nAdditionally, each\n\nreal-time data classification problem imposes its own unique\nconstraints on the class of algorithms to be used, and on\nthe flexibility and complexity of the implementation.\nAn applied data analysis study has been initiated\nto survey and evaluate different classification techniques,\ntheir trade-off considerations, and the feasibility for their\nimplementation in a real-time application.\n\nThis study will\n\ncondense the information obtained into a systematic and\nstep-by-step procedure for the selection of the appropriate\nclassifier and its implementation for real-time processing,\nbased upon specific system and data constraints.\n\nSuch a\n\n47\n\nprocedure can immensely reduce the task and effort involved\nin the selection and implementation of various classification techniques for real-time classification problems.\nB.\n\nData Analysis Facility\nA Data Analysis Facility has been established in\n\nthe Remote Sensing Center to provide an interface between\nusers and remote sensor data.\n\nThis facility includes a\n\nRemote Sensing Data Analysis System incorporating a Texas\nInstruments 980A minicomputer, the RSC Dynamic Color Display,\nAnalog/Digital-Digital/Analog Conversion capabilities, and\nvarious other equipment.\n\nAdditionally, current examples of\n\nremote sensor data, as well as catalog listings of data\navailable in the Remote Sensing Center Data Library are kept\nin the Facility, along with the Texas A&M-NOAA ERTS Browse\nfile.\n\nThis Facility has been established to provide the\n\ncapability for demonstration of remote sensing tools and\ntechniques to the general public, and to provide support for\nthe Center\'s application projects.\nRemote Sensing Data Analysis System - It has been\napparent that the analysis techniques and interpretive methodology necessary for applied remote sensing are not generally\navailable in an operational form to individuals and local\nand regional resource management agencies which might most\nbenefit by their utilization.\n\nThese techniques have been\n\n48\n\nvested in groups dedicated to remote sensing, which for\nthe most part are supported by large facilities and equipment capability. It has also been recognized that equipment\nand facility complexity required for specific applications\nis significantly less than that required for general purpose\nsupport.\n\nThe effective interface and utilization of remote\n\nsensing data by local agencies requires an integrated\ntechniques/hardware/software system.\n\nThese characteristics\n\nare included in the Center\'s Remote Sensing Data Analysis\nSystem which provides simplistic interface between user\nagency personnel and the developed techniques and available\ndata provided by the field of remote sensing.\nImplementation of a prototype analysis system suitable for remote sensing application was undertaken in line\nwith the Remote Sensing Center\'s goal of direct interfacing\nwith applications groups to provide technical support in the\narea of remote sensing.\n\nGeneral specifications for such a\n\nsystem were outlined and the evolution of the system has\nbegun.\n\nConsideration of the constraints existing in the\n\naverage user agency and the most cost-effective methods for\nsystem design within these constraints were paramount in\nsystem specification considerations.\n\nIt has been assumed\n\nthat user agencies would have a minimal technical capability\n\n49\n\nfor handling the sophisticated data analysis techniques\navailable, and that the utility of these techniques could\nbe made available only through a simplistic, interactive\nsoftware interface.\n\nHardware configurations should be\n\nsimple, inexpensive, and should maximize the amount of\ninformation available through familiar communications media.\nAs it is developed, this analysis system has been incorporated into specific RSC Application projects, and will be\nmade available for general use through the Remote Sensing\nCenter Data Analysis Facility.\nTI980A Minicomputer System - During the year,\ndelivery was taken on a Texas Instruments 980A minicomputer\nsystem which included the CPU with 12K words of memory,\nan ASR-33 teletype with a punched paper tape capability,\nand a 9 track, 800 bpi, digital magnetic tape drive.\n\nThis\n\nparticular minicomputer system was chosen as the nucleus\nof the Data Analysis System for its computational speed,\nflexible instruction set, versitile I/O interface capability,\nand the low cost of the CPU, memory and available peripherals.\nThe TI 980A, is a modern, 16-bit, microprogrammed computer\nwhich uses inexpensive, high speed, MOS-semiconductor memory,\nand has proven to be a cost-effective system component.\n\nA\n\nmagnetic tape drive was purchased to allow system interface\nwith ERTS and other computer compatable tapes, since this\n\n50\n\nis the media by which the greatest amount of remote sensor\ndata can be conveniently transferred.\nDynamic Color Display - The increasing use of\ncomputers for processing, enhancement, and presentation\nof imagery and spatial relationships has created a need\nfor flexible, high-speed interactive interface between\ncomputer data files and the human investigator.\n\nThis\n\ninterface has traditionally taken the form of monochromatic\nCRT display or line printer grey-scale mapping.\n\nThe use\n\nof the monochromatic display has been limited by the amount\nand variety of data which could effectively be presented\nthrough a grey-scale rendition.\n\nThis limitation has led to\n\nthe introduction of color displays and has effectively\nincreased the data presentation efficiency of the CRT display.\nA totally-digital color image display system,\nutilizing a standard color television receiver as the display device, has been designed and developed at the Remote\nSensing Center.\n\nThe use of a commercial television receiver\n\ninsured a low cost display terminal and allows a simplified\nexpansion capability in multiterminal applications.\nIn addition to the simple display of computer generated or enhanced imagery, this display system has provisions for real-time operator interaction either via the\ndisplay control panel or over the computer interface.\n\nUsing\n\nI\n\nDynamic Color CRT Display\nSystem\n\nI\nU\nI\n\no\nl\nOp\'eration of the Dynamic CoZor\nCRT Display System via the TI\n980A mini-computer\n\nI\n\nthe controls available, the operator can select the color\ncoding of the image, expand selected portions of the screen,\nor extract data from the screen refresh storage and display\nthe data on a numerical readout.\n\nThe display has been\n\ndesigned as an independent unit, once data has been transferred, to allow refresh and operator interaction without\ninterferring with other computer functions.\n\nThe development\n\nof the Dynamic Color Display has greatly enhanced the capability of the Center to provide direct applications support\nto user agencies, and was essential for effective interaction.\nMuch of the data available from remote sensor systems\nis available only in an analog format.\n\nTo effectively inter-\n\nact with these types of data, an analog/digital conversion\nsystem was developed as part of the Data Analysis Facility.\nThis instrumentation will permit the analysis of such analog\ndata as line scanner and radar imagery, and numerous types\nof along-track measurements.\n\nAlso developed as part of\n\nthis package has been a digital/analog interface.\n\nThis\n\ncapability will allow interaction with analog display devices,\nand facilitates simulation of analog sensor measurements\nfor testing of real-time signal analysis processors under\ndevelopment at the Center.\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nS:l\n\nAnalysis of ERTS I data using the\nCRT Display\n\nDynamic Color\n\nColor reconstruction of ERTS image showing the\nCollege Station, Texas area and the Brazos River\non the Dynamic Color CRT display\n\nDensity slicing of the demonstration image (top\nimage) to enhance the College Station area (top\ncenter-white area) and the Brazos River (center\nand bottom-black area)\n\n52\n\nSystem Software - Another major component of\nthe color display system is the software required to interface with the various hardware peripherals providing for\nmaximum interaction with user personnel.\n\nThe software\n\ndevelopment has been initiated, and it is this development\nproject which is currently the most active part of the\noverall system/facility development.\n\nA major part of the\n\noperating system software will be syntax driven algorithms\nto parse operator commands and to set the logic required\nto enable execution of driver and analysis software.\n\nThis\n\nsoftware system concept permits the specification and decoding of simple English statements for operator control.\nThis requirement for simplistic operator interaction is a\nsignificant part of the overall system specification, and\nthis particular software approach provides a flexible method\nfor effecting this interface.\n\nAnother important component\n\nof the system software will be the interface and driver\nsoftware required for management of complex data files.\nAdditional software will be developed to make specific data\nanalysis techniques available to system users.\nBrowse File - Texas A&M University and the Remote\nSensing Center have been designated as an ERTS Browse File\nFacility for NOAA.\n\nOn a monthly basis, microfilmed ERTS\n\nimagery and data catelogs are received and placed at the\n\n53\n\ndisposal of the general public through the Browse File\nFacility, which is located in the Remote Sensing Center\nData Analysis Facility.\n\nAll ERTS imagery through May,\n\n1973, and Catelogs through August, 1973, for both U. S.\nand non-U. S. regions, are currently on file.\n\nA micro-\n\nfilm reader has been provided for users of the facility.\nTo date, the greatest use of the Browse File facility has\nbeen made by petroleum exploration companies who are obtaining considerable aid by presurvey of prospect areas\nfrom ERTS imagery.\nC.\n\nSensor Systems\nDevelopment of applications of remote sensing\n\ntechniques is dependent upon the availability of adequate\nsensor systems.\n\nPhotographic and multispectral scanner\n\nsystems are operational, however other sensor systems,\nwhich could greatly expand the information collecting\ncapability within the remote sensing field, are still in\nvarious stages of development.\n\nOf particular significance\n\nin this regard are microwave sensor systems.\nThe Remote Sensing Center has maintained a leading\nposition in the development of microwave sensing techniques,\nespecially in the important application area of soil moisture monitoring.\n\nRecent work with laser systems has led\n\n54\n\nto development of a new sensing device named a Lidar\nPolarimeter.\n\nThis sensor has shown potential for\n\nremote monitoring of water quality parameters and oil\nspills on water.\nMicrowave Sensing of Soil Moisture - The Microwave and Infrared Systems Laboratory projects during this\nyear have continued the microwave sensing studies in progress for several years.\n\nThis work has led to significant\n\nadvances in the development of theoretical models and the\nacquisition and analysis of microwave measurements.\n\nThe\n\neffort has been accelerated in 1973 as a result of a\ncooperative project with the Johnson Space Center.\n\nJSC\n\nhas assembled a two-frequency passive microwave radiometer\nmounted on a "cherry-picker" truck.\n\nThe availability of\n\nthis L-band/X-band sensor permitted detailed studies of\nmicrowave emission from controlled field test sites in\nsupport of model development.\n\nExperiments using multiple\n\nfrequency airborne microwave sensors over documented sites\nat Weslaco, Texas, and Chickasha, Oklahoma were also conducted in 1973.\nThe test area near Chickasha, Oklahoma, is part\nof a watershed research area under study by the Southern\nPlains Watershed Research Center (USDA/ARS).\n\nThe studies\n\n55\n\ninclude determination of downstream runoff, sediment flow,\nand ground-water levels relative to implementation of flood\ncontrol measures.\n\nThe site consists of eleven subsites on\n\ntwo separate flight lines.\n\nThe subsites vary in length\n\nbetween 200 and 1200 meters.\n\nThe dominant soil types are\n\nReinach silt loam and McLain silty clay loam.\n\nARS field\n\nterms collected multiple soil samples from all sites to a\ndepth of 10 cm.\n\nSoil composition and moisture content were\n\ndetermined for all samples.\n\nLaboratory waveguide measurements\n\nof the complex dielectric constant of the samples were made\nat Texas AGM University.\nThe Chickasha area was overflown by the NASA CV-990\naircraft equipped with nine microwave radiometers.\n\nThree of\n\nthese (1.42 GHz, 19.4 GHz, and 37.0 GHz) provided data\nsuitable for analysis.\n\nAt the time of the overflight the\n\ntest area soils were relatively dry (average moisture content\nof 10 percent), and a moderate vegetation cover was present\non most fields.\nThe Weslaco, Texas site is an established NASA Test\nSite operated by the USDA/ARS and has been the location of\nprevious soil moisture monitoring experiments conducted by\nthe Remote Sensing Center.\n\nThe site consists of a 29 kilometer\n\nlong section of agricultural fields.\n\nThe predominant soil\n\nis Harlingen clay. .At the time of the overflight, approximately half of the fields were plowed bare ground.\n\nThe\n\n56\n\nremainder supported corn, sorghum, and vegetables in\nvarious stages of development.\n\nThe entire area was satu-\n\nrated due to heavy rains preceeding the flight.\nAnalysis of the Chickasha microwave emission\ndata showed two major features:\n\nfirst, the microwave bright-\n\nness temperatures measurements of fields having moisture\ncontent of less than 15 percent did not correlate with soil\nmoisture, and second, the presence of vegetation adversely\naffected the interpretation of the results.\n\nHowever, an\n\nanalysis of both the Chickasha and Weslaco measurements\nestablished a linear relationship between soil moistures and\nmicrowave emission of -2.15 0 K/percent moisture at 1.42 GHz,\nwhich is in good agreement with previous results.\nOne of the most significant results of the experiment was the identification of the effect of vegetation on\nthe microwave measurements.\n\nSubsequently, a project was\n\ndeveloped to examine this effect.\n\nIn this work, models\n\nwere developed for the apparent microwave temperature and\nradar backscatter coefficient of vegetated terrain to\nillustrate the effects of vegetation on the sensitivity of\nthese parameters to variations of soil moisture.\n\nThree\n\ntypes of terrain are simulated for both the passive and the\nactive case:\n\na uniform canopy over a smooth surface, plant\n\nrows on a smooth surface, and plant rows on a rough surface.\n\n57\n\nIn each case the canopy is defined by its overall dimensions\nand by its electric permittivity, which is determined from\nthe Weiner model for dielectric mixture.\n\nEmission and scat-\n\ntering from both the soil and the canopy were considered, but\natmospheric effects were neglected.\nThe expression developed for the apparent temperature\nof vegetated terrain includes terms for the apparent temperature of the bare soil and of the canopy.\n\nThe bare soil\n\nterm is modified by an exponential term to account for attenuation of radiation from the soil by the canopy.\n\nThe term\n\nwhich represents radiation by the canopy assumes that the\ncanopy is a homogeneous layer.\n\nThe expression for the ap-\n\nparent temperature of row crops is the average of the apparent temperatures of covered or shadowed soil and visible\nbare soil.\n\nA rough surface is represented by a surface rough-\n\nness factor and a coefficient of effective area of specular\nrefraction.\nThe expression developed for the backscatter coefficient of vegetated terrain is similar to the expression for\napparent temperature.\n\nThe term for backscatter from smooth,\n\nbare soil is determined by the physical optics method.\n\nThe\n\nterm for backscatter from the canopy is a modified form of\na model for scattering from long, thin dielectric cylinders.\n\n58\n\nCalculated data indicate that the sensitivity of\nthe apparent temperature and backscatter coefficient to\nvariations of soil moisture, decreases as the amount of\nvegetation increases.\n\nIt is shown that the same effect\n\nresults from increasing signal frequency or angle of\nincidence.\nThese studies established a foundation for a series\nof ground-based microwave measurements designed to verify\nthe basic models.\n\nThe NASA two-frequency (L-band and X-band)\n\npassive microwave system was used to measure emission from\nfield plots exhibiting three stages of surface roughness on\na uniform soil type.\n\nThe plots were irrigated to produce a\n\nwide range of soil moisture conditions.\n\nThe initial data\n\nwere recorded for bare soil, then the plots were planted with\na uniform vegetation, and all measurements were repeated.\nThe data are in the process of being reduced and analyzed\nfor comparison with the model predictions.\nLaser Sensing of Polluted Water - Theoretical roughsurface scattering theory developments during the 1972 program suggested that a dual-polarization laser-backscatter\nsystem (Lidar Polarimeter) should be capable of unambiguous\npolarization ratio measurements of subsurface scatter.\n\nIn\n\n1972, a small 5 mw helium-neon laser system (X= 633nm) was\n\nI\nMeasuring the Microwave emission of bare soil using the\nNASA/JSC Microwave Signature\nAcquisition Sy.stem to determine effects of soil moisture\nand surface roughness\n\nI\nObtaining soil moisture and\ntemperature profiles of the\nplots\nduring the\nbare soil\nmicrowave experiments\n\n59\n\ndesigned, constructed, and used to study the feasibility\nof active remote water quality monitoring based on\npolarization ratio measurements.\n\nThe results of the\n\nstudy showed a relationship between incident beam diameter and absolute impurity concentrations.\n\nThe study\n\nalso showed the signal-to-noise ratio feasibility of\nvery low power systems for daylight operation at slant\nranges in excess of 30 meters, and for a low altitude airborne system with moderate laser power.\nIn 1973, additional laboratory studies were conducted to further verify that subsurface contaminant concentrations were related to the Lidar Polarimeter measurements.\n\nThe rough surface scattering theory was extended\n\nand good agreement with the theory was obtained in laboratory measurements of both smooth and rough surface targets.\nA second generation, field-portable Lidar Polarimeter instrument was designed and constructed based upon\nthe experience gained in the laboratory studies.\n\nThis\n\ninstrument has been used for field studies on the Brazos\nRiver and the Houston Ship Channel.\n\nComparison of the\n\nresults of laboratory analysis of water samples and the\nLidar Polarimeter field data indicates excellent correlation\n\n60\n\nbetween standard side-scattering nephelometer turbidity\nand the laser backscatter measurements.\n\nThe Lidar Polari-\n\nmeter has been operated from atop bridges and from the\ndeck of a moving research vessel, and provided rapid,\naccurate recordings of turbidity.\nAs a result of the success of testing with the\nmonochromatic Lidar Polarimeter, a dual-wavelength system\nhas been designed for detection of oil spills on water.\nThe two-frequency (633 nm, 442 nm) concept is being employed\nto enhance the detectability of a wide range of petroleum\nproducts.\n\nThis work, funded by the Coast Guard, will pro-\n\nvide a prototype system of a field sensor capable of continuous monitoring of natural waterways.\nThe extension of the rough surface scattering theory\nand associated laboratory measurements was developed around\nprevious studies of the Kirchhoff (physical optics) approach\nconducted by the Remote Sensing Center.\n\nThe emphasis in\n\nthis work has been on obtaining a description of the depolarization of incident electromagnetic waves due to subsurface\nvolume scatter.\n\nThe theoretical study included polarized\n\nand depolarized components contributed by both the surface\nand subsurface scatterers.\n\nIn order to investigate the\n\nvalidity of the assumptions concerning the physical phenomenon utilized in the theoretical development, a series of\n\nLIDAR Polarimeter designed\nand constructed at the\nRemote Sensing Center\n\nExperimental measurements\nof the Houston Ship Channel (above) and the Brazos\nRiver (right) to determine\nthe feasibility of remotely detecting surface oil\nand measuring water quality\n\n61\n\ndual polarization laser backscatter measurements of rough\nsurfaces exhibiting a volume scattering process were performed.\n\nThe experiment utilized both smooth turbid water\n\nand cast dielectric samples.\n\nThe turbid solutions inves-\n\ntigated were composed of a high concentration of scatterers\nand absorbing material to control the amount of volume\nscatter.\n\nThe dielectric samples were pigmented to vary\n\nthe amount of volume scatter from a negligible amount to\na level where the surface scatter was negligible.\n\nAlso the\n\nsurface roughness of the samples was varied from a very rough\nto a moderately rough surface.\n\nUsing these targets, polarized\n\nand depolarized backscatter measurements were recorded using\nboth horizontal and vertical transmit polarization for angles\nof incidence between 0* and 700 from nadir.\nThe experiment with water showed that the subsurface\ndepolarization mechanism was dependent on both the number\ndensity of particles suspended in the medium and the concentration of dye dissolved in the medium.\n\nAlso, it indi-\n\ncated that multiple scattering within the turbid water provides the primary contribution to the depolarized backscatter\nfor spherical particles.\nThe data obtained using cast dielectric targets\nvaried from a polarization ratio of approximately unity\nto a minimum below .the sensitivity of the system.\n\nA\n\n62\n\nsurface-dependent depolarized return was measured for\nvery rough, non-volume scatter (black) samples which\nwas not present for the smoothest black sample.\n\nHowever,\n\nthis term was insignificant in contrast to the strong\nvolume scatter samples.\n\nThe depolarized volume scatter\n\nis independent of the surface roughness for incidence\nangles less than.550\n\n.\n\nAlso, reciprocity is valid for the\n\ndepolarization mechanism.\nIn order to examine the validity of the theoretical development, calculated values from the theory were\ncompared to the experimental data.\n\nThe results of this\n\nindicated that the calculated values and the experimental\nvalues had correlation coefficients greater than 90% for\nmost of the data.\n\nTherefore, the physical and mathematical\n\napproximations utilized in the theoretical analysis appear\nto be valid.\nPhotographic Sensing - The Remote Sensing Center\nutilizes two aircraft at Texas A&M University to conduct\nphotographic sensing missions.\n\nThese modified DeHaviland\n\nBeaver aircraft are equipped with a variety of camera systems,\nincluding a Ziess RMK A 15/23 (9" x 9") camera.\n\nA multiband\n\ncamera system has been installed in one of the Beaver aircraft.\n\nThe camera system consists of two 20 mm Hasselblad\n\n63\n\ncameras and one K-17 mapping camera.\n\nThe cameras are\n\npresently mounted to take oblique pictures for water\nquality studies.\n\nThe mapping camera takes a picture\n\nthat extends from the nadir to the horizon.\n\nIn most\n\ncases, the photos can be taken to include shoreline\nwith sufficient horizontal control for photographic\norientation.\n\nThe three cameras have been timed to take\n\nsimultaneous pictures so that the orientation matrix for\nthe mapping camera can also be utilized for the 70 mm\ncameras.\nA photographic film processing laboratory is\nbeing organized to process aerial film.\n\nMost of the equip-\n\nment for the darkroom has been acquired, and the Center is\nin the process of modifying existing laboratory space for\na darkroom.\n\nThe facility will enable processing of both\n\ncolor and black and white film up to 9 1/2 inches wide.\nThe processing equipment now in use include a Morse B-5\nrewind film processor, Nikon 70 mm film processor with\n100-ft. reel, Kindermann, 70 mm film processor with 15-ft.\nreel, film dryer, contact printer, print dryer, sinks and\nother minor equipment have been acquired for the facility.\nA Macbeth transmission densitometer model TD-504\nwas acquired by the Center to quantitatively evaluate the\nlight return from objects with aerial photography.\n\nThe\n\n64\n\ndensitometer has a digital readout and is equipped with\nthree color filters and a visual filter for density\nmeasurements within a range of 0 to 4.0.\nD.\n\nSignal Processing\nThe problem of handling the enormous data volume\n\nassociated with many remote sensing applications has motivated research into numerous data reduction processes.\n\nThe\n\nRemote Sensing Center is participating in development of\nimproved procedures for computer processing of multivariate\ndata, but is also very active in developing new real-time\nsignal processing systems.\n\nThe potential for remote sensing\n\ndata reduction at the sensor output is considerable, and\nit has been found that the desired information product can\noften be obtained directly from the electrical signal output of the sensor in real-time.\n\nThe Center has developed\n\nsignal processing systems for three specific remote sensing\napplications:\n\nremote identification of Arctic sea ice;\n\nremote turbulent air velocity measurements; and remote\nmonitoring of water quality.\nRadar Signal Processor - Activities in the area\nof real-time radar signal processing and analysis were conducted by the Remote Sensing Center under support of the\n\n65\n\nNaval Ordnance Laboratory.\n\nThis program included develop-\n\nment of a laboratory prototype processor system for concurrent use with data obtained by the Ryan 13.3 GHz Doppler\nradar system (scatterometer).\n\nThe processor package is\n\ndesigned to yield a specific product output of ice class\nutilizing radar measurements from Arctic sea ice.\n\nAlthough\n\nthis processing system has not been developed to the point\nof actual data processing, the fundamental signal processing\nfunctions required for data reduction have been demonstrated.\nThe system implements two major levels of analysis:\na) signal processing in which the data are reduced to corrected\nreturn magnitudes as a function of incident angle and b) classification analysis of this "scattering characteristic" to yield\nan ice class output.\nThe concept of a stand-alone scatterometer signal\nprocessor capable of real-time signal processing and analysis\nis significant not only in the development of the Arctic ice\nclassification system but it also provides the means by\nwhich utilization of the radar scatterometer becomes more\npractical.\nThe inability to obtain timely data, in addition\nto the costly and time consuming computer analyses required\nfor analysis, have hindered realization of the full potential\nof the radar scatterometer.\n\nThe fully developed NOL signal\n\nReal time radar scatterometer signal processor and\n\nanalog recorder\n\nI\n\nLaboratory set up for\nground evaluation of the\nradar signal processor\n\nEvaluating the radar signal processor\n\nIs\n\n66\n\nanalysis system will provide real-time processed output\ndata at three levels.\n\nThese include: a) a sign sensed\n\ndoppler spectrum, b) corrected return magnitudes as a\nfunction of incident angle, and c) a read-out of ice class.\nThe first two types of output data will enhance\nscatterometer system utilization by providing the investigator with a) the assurance that valid measurements have\nbeen obtained, b) information regarding those portions of\nthb data which are worthly of complete processing by available digital techniques, and c) data in the form of a signsensed or completely separated fore-aft doppler spectrum.\nThese are significant factors because present digital processing time requirements are a minimum of eight times\nreal-time.\n\nIn addition, increased utility of this parti-\n\ncular sensor by development of real-time analysis capability is of great importance in studies attempting to explain\nthe scattering mechanism responsible for the radar return\nsignal.\nThe Ryan system illuminates an area \xc2\xb1600 along the\nflight line and \xc2\xb11.50 transverse to the flight line providing an analog output from which it is possible, after\nsuitable operations, to extract information concerning the\nvariation of the backscattered energy with incidence angle.\nThe underlying physical principle governing the operation\n\n67\n\nof the Ryan scatterometer is the embedding of the variation\nof the backscattered energy with incidence angle in the\nfrequency of the reflected signal.\n\nThis phenomenon is a\n\nresult of the doppler effect which establishes a sinusoidal\nrelationship between the frequency shift about the center\nfrequency transmitted by the radar and the angle of incidence.\n\nThe signal reflected back to the radar antenna is\n\na spectral distribution about the radar carrier frequency.\nThe fore data, i.e. the return from positive incidence angles,\nis located in that portion of the backscattered spectrum\ngreater than the radar carrier frequency.\n\nThose frequency\n\ncomponents of the return signal below the carrier frequency\nare referred to as the aft data.\nSince the Ryan scatterometer is a zero IF system,\nprovision is made to separate the aft from the fore data\n(the aft data portion of the doppler spectrum will have\nbeen folded onto the fore data portion during heterodyning\nto baseband).\n\nThis is provided for within the Ryan system\n\nby generation of two quadrature channels, one containing\nthe sum of the fore and the aft signals and the other containing their difference.\nUtilizing these quadrature channel inputs, five\nprimary considerations arise in processing the data:\na) separation of the fore and the aft return, b) sampling\n\n68\n\nthose portions of the received doppler spectrum corresponding to the incidence angles of interest, c) generation of system timing to control spectral sampling and\nto allow for proper ground cell alignment, d) storage\nof the sample returns until a sample for each angle of\ninterest for a particular ground cell has been acquired,\nand e) data correction for aircraft parameter variation.\nReal-time scatterometer signal processing requirements dictate performance, concurrent with data acquisition,\nof the following functions:\n\na) sign-sensing, b) data\n\nspectrum filtering, c) timing generation, d) sample storage,\nand e) data correction for aircraft parameter variation.\nThe existing processor system designed and developed by the\nRemote Sensing Center,\nfour of these functions.\n\nis structured to perform the first\nThe system is composed of two\n\nmodule packages; these include: a) the Processor Module,\nresponsible for conditioning the scatterometer output data\nand storage of the sampled return, and b) the Time Base\nModule, responsible for generation of all system timing.\nThe existing system is capable of simultaneous,\nreal-time processing the radar return from a particular\nground cell at five angles of incidence, with a cycle time\nof approximately 8 seconds.\n\n69\n\nThe system includes a special purpose analog\ncomputer developed specifically to implement algorithms\nfor classification of the radar returns according to sea\nice type.\n\nThe classification system uses a linear dis-\n\ncriminator classification scheme and is programmable.\nLaser Doppler Velocimeter Signal Processor State-of-the-art remote sensing instrumentation for turbulent air velocity measurement includes recently developed\nLaser Dopper Velocimeter (LDV) systems which detect individual aerosol particle velocities via scattered laser\nlight.\n\nThe resulting data consists of randomly-timed\n\nsamples of the velocity time history at the measurement\npoint defined by a focused optical system.\n\nIn single-\n\ncomponent measurements of turbulent flow, the parameters\nof interest are mean velocity, normalized rms fluctuation\n(turbulence intensity), and power density spectrum.\nThe Remote Sensing Center is developing new theory\nand minicomputer algorithms for on-line compuiation of mean\nturbulence intensity and power density spectrum from rancomly timed sampled data with low average data rates.\n\nThe\n\nwork is supported by the U.S. Air Force Arnold Engineering\nDevelopment Center.\n\n70\n\nThere are many applications for practical power\nspectrum analysis where it would be beneficial to deliberately use randomly timed data samples instead of periodic\nsamples, because the Nyquist sampling criteria may be avoided.\n\nHowever, until very recently no practical estimation\n\nprocedures utilizing randomly timed samples have been discussed in the literature.\n\nThe LDV data analysis problem\n\nprovides a concrete application where the sample times are\nrandom by nature, and it is necessary to search for new\ncomputational techniques.\n\nSuch techniques have been lo-\n\ncated and are presently being modified for increased computational efficiency.\nThe results of the initial derivations, literature\nsearch, and feasibility experiments were presented at the\nOklahoma State University "Workshop on Laser Doppler\nAnenometry", held June 11-13, 1973, Stillwater, Oklahoma.\nThe improved results of later experiments have been presented at an invited lecture presentation at NASA Langley\nResearch Center, August 27,\n\n1973, and described in a paper\n\nto be presented at the 1973 National Telecommunications\nConference, November, Atlanta, Georgia.\nLidar Polarimeter Signal Processor - The Lidar\nPolarimeter sensor being developed for the Coast Guard\n\n71\n\nincludes a real-time signal processing and classification\nsystem for immediate identification of water conditions.\nThe classification systems design is based upon the\nArctic ice radar signal classifications system developed\nfor NOL, however the Coast Guard system employs digital\nelectronics.\n\nThe system will be capable of continuous,\n\nreal-time signal processing in support of an oil spill\nalert network.\n\n72\n\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe 1972-73 programs emphasized the reorientation of the NASA Interdisciplinary Grant toward the\ndemonstration of applications of remote sensing techniques.\nThe professional staff was expanded to enable a rapid implementation of several new Applications projects developed\nin cooperation with state and federal agencies.\n\nThe first\n\nyear of this new program approach was extremely successful,\ndue in part to the coincident development of an active\ninterest in remote sensing by several agencies of the Texas\nstate government.\n\nAs a result, the program is scheduled\n\nfor continued expansion during the coming year, and further\ninvolvement with personnel from the Office of the Governor\nof Texas is planned.\nDuring this year the Center initiated new projects\nfor the NASA Johnson Space Center, Naval Ordnance Laboratory,\nand the Coast Guard.\n\nThese programs are in the area of\n\nremote sensing techniques and sensor system development, and,\nhence, assist in maintaining the balance in the Center\nbetween the Applications and Supporting Technology areas.\nThe Center has agreed to provide technical and administrative support to the Johnson Space Center in the\nconduct of an Active Microwave Workshop to be held in 1974.\n\n73\n\nThe workshop project will document the status of active\nmicrowave sensing of earth resources and the environment.\nThe Center also anticipates participation in the NASA\nJoint Soil Moisture Experiment scheduled for the Spring\n1974.\n\nThis project will combine the expertise of several\n\ninvestigators working in this field in an attempt to establish the potential of microwave sensors for remote soil\nmoisture monitoring.\n\n74\n\nVII.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\nA.\n\nTechnical Reports\nThe following is a complete list of Tech-\n\nnical Reports published by the Remote Sensing Center:\nRSC-01\n\nRadar Scatterometer

R. Moore and R. H. Haas\n\nAbstract\nColor-IR aerial photography and ground observations were acquired at two sampling dates from three grazing\npastures and two soil types at the Sonora Range Station.\nVegetation characteristics influencing deer habitat components (food and cover) were measured from ground and air\nphoto surveys. Aerial photography provided information\nnecessary for evaluating deer habitat by delineating and\nclassifying food-cover types on three study pastures. Reliability of the habitat classification scheme was determined by comparing the location and extent of favorable types\nto available deer density counts.\nGround observations provided fundamental data\nfor assessing the accuracy of air photo measurements. The\npoint-centered quarter (PCQ), plotless technique was employed to measure composition, density, and canopy cover of\nwoody vegetation from ground and air photo surveys.\nAir\nphoto quadrat methods were used to estimate density and\ncanopy cover. An air photo dot grid method was also employed to determine canopy cover.\nWoody plant composition measured by ground and\nair photo survey compared well for major species.\nDensity\nestimated from ground and air photo PCQ data were consistently higher than air photo quadrat counts.\nCanopy\ncover was poorly estimated from ground observations but\nwas accurately measured by air photo methods. The air\nphoto quadrat and dot grid techniques produced very similar canopy cover percentages. Air photo measurements\nwere obtained with relative ease and in a small fraction\nof the time required for ground measurements.\nQualitative\nestimates of herbage yield and standing green biomass compared well with quantitative ground measurements.\n\nImportant vegetation characteristics of deer\nFoodhabitat were used to classify food-cover types.\ncover type mapping and characterization were possible\nfrom medium to large scale color- 1~ aerial photography.\nSuitable classes of food-cover types developed for this\ninvestigation agreed well with available deer density\ndata for the test pastures.\n\nA-3\n\nTechnical Report RSC-42\nWATER QUALITY PARAMETER MEASUREMENT\nUSING SPECTRAL SIGNATURES\nP. E. White\n\nAbstract\nIncreased concern about water quality and the\nlack of fast,\ninexpensive methods o? measuring water\nquality parameters over large areas have prompted interest in remote sensing techniques. Previous studies indicate that some water quality parameters influence remotely sensed spectral signatures, but currently there\nis no method of measuring water quality parameters from\nspectral signatures.\nThis study applies regression analysis to the\nproblem of measuring water quality parameters from remote\nsensing spectraL stgnature data.\nIt presents the equations necessary to perform regression analysis and describes methods of testing the strength and reliability\nof a regression.\nIt also presents an efficient algorithm\nfor selecting an optimal subset of the independent variables available for a regression.\nTo illustrate the regression techniques, they\nare applied to a particular set of data from the Houston\nShip Channel.\nUnfortunately, deficiencies in the quality\nand quantity of the data that were available prevent definite conclusions to be drawn from the analysis.\nResults of the study show that regression analysis is applicable to the problem of measuring water\nquality parameters from remote sensing spectral signatures,\nbut that the utility of the method needs further testing\non much larger sets of data.\nRecommendations resulting from this study are\nthat regression analysis techniques be applied to data\nfrom ERTS-1, and that new water quality parameters based\non the reflective characteristics of water be defined for\nimproved correlation with remote sensing data.\n\nA-4\n\nTechnical Report RSC-47\nREMOTE MEASUREMENT OF TURBIDITY AND CHLOROPHYLL\nTHROUGH AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY\nM. D. Schwebel\n\nAbstract\nStudies were conducted utilizing six different\nfilm and filter combinations to quantitatively detect\nchlorophyll and turbidity in six farm ponds. The low\nrange of turbidity from 0-35 JTU correlated well with\nthe density readings from the green band of normal color\nfilm and the high range above 35 JTU was found to correlate with density readings in the red band of color\ninfrared film. The effect of many of the significant\nvariables can be reduced by using standardized procedures\nin taking the photography.\nAttempts to detect chloilophyll were masked by\nthe turbidity. The ponds which were highly turbid also\nhad high chlorophyll concentrations; whereas, the ponds\nwith low turbidity also had low chlorophyll concentrations.\nThis prevented a directed correlation for this parameter.\nSeveral suggested approaches are cited for\npossible future investigations.\n\nA-5\n\nTechnical Memorandum RSC-80\nAPPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING\nDavid J.

Harker\n\nAbstract\nRemote sensing may be able to play a significant\nrole in the development of a successful program to delineate\nflood plains and thereby aid in the implementation of the\nFederal Flood Policy involving the control of flood plains.\nAn experiment was undertaken to evaluate a technique using\nmultispectral data that may permit the rapid and accurate\ndelineation of flood plain areas, minimizing extensive field\nwork or numerous hydrologic calculations. A test site for\nthis experiment was selected just north .of College Station,\nTexas along a twenty-five mile section of the Navasota River.\nThis section existed in a relatively natural state, suggesting that natural parameters associated with the flood plain\nmay not have been measurably disturbed. Aerial infrared\nphotographs of the.test site were obtained, converted to a\nsimulation of multispectral scanner data, processed using\nautomatic classification techniques previously developed in\nthe remote sensing field, and compared with the classified\ndata of the known test site flood plain.\nThe flood plain\nboundary delineated by the simulated multispectral data\ncorrelated well with the boundary developed by the Corps of\nEngineers corresponding to a discharge of 50,000 CRS. These\nresults were analyzed and related to the flood hazard problem currently existing in the United States.\n\nA-7\n\nTechnical Memorandum RSC-77\nSPECTRAL REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS OF MAIZE DWARF MOSAIC\nVIRUS INFECTED SORGHUM\nDr. R. W. Toler\n\nAbstract\n\nGrain Sorghum (Sorghum volgare pers.) a susceptible host for Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus was used as the\ntype host to study spectral reflectance properties in\norder to differentiate between healthy and MDMV infected\nplants by remote sensing techniques. This host was selected because of it\'s economic importance in Texas and\nthe Southwest.\nIn addition this virus-host combination\nhas the following characteristics 1) sorghum gives .a\ntypical mosaic reaction plus a red-leaf stage that produces necrotic areas, 2) it is a hybrid summer annual,\n3) well adapted to the test site area, 4) genetically\nstable, 5) susceptible to mechanical transmission of the\nvirus, and 6) typical of cultivated row crops.\nLaboratory measurements of spectral reflectance using a Cary 14\nspectrophotometer were made on plants grown and virus\ninoculated in the greenhouse. Spectral measurements were\nmade (350 nm to 900 nm) on healthy sorghum and plants\ninfected for 3 days and plants infected 7 days or more.\nAnalysis of the data indicated four possible regions which\ncan be used for spectral differentiation between healthy\nand MDMV diseased sorghum.\nThese regions are centered on\n450 nm, 525 nm, 650 nm and 800 nm. Maize Dwarf Mosaic\nVirus was detected in sorghum and severity estimates were\nmade using aerial photographic techniques.\nGround truth\nsites were established in 1972 and the 1973 growing seasons\nand photographed from a remote platform. Photographic\nimagery, using Ektachrome Aero 2443 that was processed to\npositive transparencies, was obtained from a Zeiss RMK A\n15/23 (9" x 9") camera equipped with a Zeiss D (0525 nm)\ncutoff filter mounted in a modified DehaviZand Beaver\nAircraft.\nDensity points and density ranges were estabZished using a steroscopic viewer.

L. Kroll\n\nAbstract\nSeveral remote sensors have been proposed as\npotentially applicable for monitoring soil moisture.\nMicrowave sensors appear to have an advantage over shorter\nwavelength sensors because of their deeper penetration into\nthe soil and their relative immunity to atmospheric effects.\nThe capability of airborne microwave radiometers to monitor\nsoil moisture was investigated.\nIn this report the current status of microwave\nradiometry is provided. The fundamentals of the microwave\nradiometer are reviewed with particular reference to airborne operations, and the interpretative procedures normally\nused for the modeling of the apparent temperature are presented.\nAirborne microwave radiometer measurements were\nmade over selected flight lines in Chickasha, Oklahoma and\nWeslaco, Texas.\nExtensive ground measurements of soil\nmoisture were made in support of the aircraft mission over\nthe two locations. In addition, laboratory determination\nof the complex permittivities of soil samples taken from\nthe flight lines were made with varying moisture contents.\nThe data were analyzed to determine the degree of\ncorrelation between measured apparent temperatures and soil\nmoisture content. The Chickasha fields were fairly dry\n(<200 moisture content) and no correlation of apparent\ntemperature with soil moisture existed for the Chickasha\ndata. A heavy rain preceding the Weslaco flight invalidated\nthe ground soil moisture measurements.\nHowever, an assumed\nvalue of the soil moisture content of the Weslaco fields\nwas derived from known moisture retention curves for the\nsoil type.\nThe combined results of the Chickasha and\nWeslaco experiments using the derived soil moisture values\n\nyielded a high degree of correlation of apparent temperature and soil moisture. Regression analysis indicated a\n-2.15 0 C/percent moisture variation in apparent temperature\nfor the 1.42 GHz radiometer, vertical polarization, for\nbare or nearly bare fields, which compares favorably with\nthe results reported by Jean [10].\nThe center cell of the\n19.4 GHz, horizontal polarization, had an average variation\nin apparent temperature of -1.5 0 C/percent moisture when\nobserving vegetated fields.\n\nA-10\n\nTechnical Report RSC-44\nMICROWAVE EMISSION AND SCATTERING FROM\nVEGETATED TERRAIN\nT. G. Sibley\nAbstract\n2 this report, models are developed for the\napparent temperature and backscatter coefficient of vegetated terrain to illustrate the effects of vegetation on\nthe sensitivity of these \'parameters to variations of soil\nmoisture. Three types of terrain are simulated for both\nthe passive and the active case:\na uniform canopy over a\nsmooth surface, plant rows on a smooth surface, and plant\nrows on a rough surface.\nIn each case the canopy is defined by its overall dimensions and by its electric permittivity, which is determined from the Weiner model for\ndielectric mixture. Emission and scattering from both the\nsoil and the canopy are considered, but atmospheric effects\nare neglected.\nThe expression for the apparent temperature of\nvegetated terrain includes terms for the apparent temperature of the bare soil and of the canopy. The bare soil\nterm is modified by an exponential term to account for\nattenuation of radiation from the soil by the canopy.\nThe\nterm which represents radiation by the canopy assumes that\nthe canopy is a homogeneous layer. The expression for the\napparent temperature of row crops is the average of the\napparent temperatures of covered or shadowed soil and visible bare soil. A rough surface is represented by a surface roughness factor and a coefficient of effective area\nof specular refraction.\nThe expression for the backscatter coefficient\nof vegetated terrain is similar to the expression for apparent temperature. The term for backscatter from smooth,\nbare soil is determined by the physical optics method.\nThe term for backscatter from the canopy is a modified form\nof a model for scattering from long, thin dielectric cylinders.\n\nCalculated data indicate that the sensitivity of\nthe apparent temperature and backscatter coefficient to\nvariations of soil moisture, decreases as the amount of\nvegetation increases.\nIt is shown that the same effect\nresults from increasing signal frequency or angle of\nincidence.\nSeveral sets of equivalent vegetation states,\ndefined as different combinations of parameters which yield\nequivalent data, are tabulated. It is shown that in many\ncases the height-density product of a uniform canopy may\nbe used to identify equivalent states.\n\nA-11\n\nTechnical Report RSC-46\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF A SIGNAL PROCESSING NETWORK FOR\nA REAL-TIME ARCTIC SEA ICE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\nW.

J. Bruns\n\nAbstract\nThe increasing use of computers for processing\nand enhancement of imagery has created a need for a flexible, high-speed, interactive interface between the computer and the human investigator.\n~i the past, this interface has taken the form of a monochromatic CRT display.\nThe use of the monochromatic display, however, has been\nlimited by the inability of the human eye to discriminate\nbetween intensity levels of gray. This has led to the\nuse of color displays to display both true color images\nand color enhanced black and white images.\nThis thesis describes the design and development\nof a totally digital color image display system utilizing\na standard color television receiver as the display device.\nThe use of a commercial television receiver provides a\nsource of a low cost display terminal and allows simple\nexpansion for multiterminal applications.\nIn addition to the simple display of computer\ngenerated or enhanced imager, this display system has provisions for real-time interaction between both the computer and the displayed data and the operator and the\ndisplayed data. The computer interaction is enabled by\na set of command instructions provided to the computer.\nThrough these instructions, the computer can modify seZected portions of the displayed data, as well as extract\nnumeric data directly from the screen.\nThe operator interacts with the display system through a control panel.\nUsing the controls available, the operator can select the\ncolor coding of the image, expand selected portions of the\nscreen or extract data from the screen and display the\ndata in a numeric readout.\nThe display system and the\noperator interface provisions are completely independent\n\nof the computer; once the data have been transferred from\nthe computer, the display is a stand-alone unit.\nRecommendations are made regarding the future\nutilization of this display system and the development of\npossible additional features.\nAlso discussed are selected\nsoftware routines which. could be generated to realize the\nfull potential of the computer interaction instruction\nset.\n\nA-14\n\nTechnical Report RSC-45\nAN INVESTIGATION OF THE DEPOLARIZATION OF\nBACKSCATTERED ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES\nUSING A LIDAR POLARIMETER\nG. J. Wilhelmi\n\nAbstract\nIn this study, the Kirchhoff approach following\nLeader [1] and Rouse [2] has been extended to encompass\nbackscatter contributions from both the surface and subsurface. This extension included both polarized and depolarized components.\nIn order to investigate the validity of the assumptions concerning the physical phenomenon\nutilized in the theoretical development, a series of dual\npolarization laser backscatter measurements of rough surfaces exhibiting a volume scattering process were performed.\nThe experiment utilized both smooth turbid water and cast\ndielectric samples.\nThe turbid solutions investigated\nwere composed of a high concentration of scatterers and\nabsorbing material to control the amount of volume scatter.\nThe dielectric samples were pigmented to vary the amount\nof volume scatter from a negligible amount to a level\nwhere the surface scatter was negligible. Also, the\nsurface roughness of the samples was varied from a very\nrough to a moderately rough surface.\nUsing these targets,\npolarized and depolarized backscatter measurements were\nrecorded using both horizontal and vertical transmit\npolarization for angles of incidence between 00 and 700\nfrom nadir.\nThe experiment with water showed that the subsurface depolarization mechanism was dependent on both\nthe number density of particles suspended in the medium\nand the concentration of dye dissolved in the medium.\nAlso, it indicated that multiple scattering within the\nturbid water is the primary contribution to the depolarized\nbackscatter for spherical particles.\n\nThe data obtained using cast dielectric targets\nvaried from a polarization ratio of approximately unity,\nto a minimum below the sensitivity of the system. A\nsurface-dependent depolarized return was measured for very\nrough, non-volume scatter (black) samples which was not\npresent for the smoothest black sample.\nHowever, this\nterm was insignificant in contrast to the strong volume\nscatter samples.\nThe depolarized volume scatter is independent of the surface roughness for incidence angles less\nthan 550\n\nAlso, reciprocity is valid for the depolarization\n\nmechanism.\nIn order to examine the validity of the theoretical development, calculated values from the theory were\ncompared to the experimental data. The results of this\nindicated that the calculated values and the experimental\nvalues had correlation coefficients greater than 90% for\nmost of the data. Therefore, the physical and mathematical\napproximations utilized in the theoretical analysis appear\nto be valid.\n\n[1]\n\nJ.

A minicomputer and special purpose digital\nhardware were used\' to record sample magnitudes and time differences of a controllable electronic noise process.\nData\nwere recorded over a parametric range of mean sample rates.\nGood agreement with theory was obtained in predicting the mean square error in the turbulence intensity\nestimate as a function of the ratio of the mean sample rate\nto twice the equivalent power bandwidth of the velocity\nspectrum.\nThe results with the mean estimate showed an increase\nof estimate error with increasing sample rate, but not as\nmuch as predicted.\nTheoretical prediction of spectrum errors\nin terms of the system and data parameters has not yet been\naccomplished. However, empirical error analysis indicates\nthat the optimum mean data rate is less than or equal to\ntwice the spectrum bandwidth when computational efficiency\nis a major criterion.\n\nThe REMOTE SENSING CENTER was established by authority of the Board of Directors of\nthe Texas A&M University System on February 27, 1968.
