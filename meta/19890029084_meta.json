Mission velocity requirements for a range of missions are presented. A simple model relating optimum exhaust velocity and maximum system delta-V as a function of system-specific energy is developed, which provides insight into the relationship between system performance and various power and propulsion subsystem characteristics. Based on this model, various advanced propulsion options, e.g., the solid-core nuclear rocket and nuclear electric propulsion, are evaluated, and the implications of this analysis for propulsion and power system technology development programs are discussed. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of future propulsion requirements for the nonspecialist.", "title": "Future spacecraft propulsion", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T00:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890029084, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Garrison, P.
