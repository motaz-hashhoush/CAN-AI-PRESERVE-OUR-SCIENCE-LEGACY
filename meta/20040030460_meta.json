Based on these distribution maps, most of internal waves in the northeast part of SCS were propagating westward. The wave crest can be as long as 200 km with amplitude of 100 m, due to strong current from the Kuroshio branching out into the SCS. In recent Asian Seas International Acoustics Experiment (ASIAEX), moorings have been deployed in April 2000 and May 2001. Simultaneous RADARSAT ScanSAR images have been collected during the field test to integrate with the model and the in-situ measurements in the SCS. During ASIAEX in May 2001, many large internal waves were observed at the test area and were the major features for acoustic volume interaction. The environmental parameters have been calculated based on extensive CTD castings and mooring data. Nonlinear internal wave models have been applied to simulate the wave evolution on the continental shelf and the results compare reasonably with mooring measurements. The evolution and dissipation of huge internal waves on the shelf break, mode-two waves, elevation waves, and wave-wave interaction are very important issues for acoustic propagation. The implication of internal wave effects on acoustic propagation will also be discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040030460, "endDate": "2003-07-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Workshop on Internal Solutions and Their Impacts", "location": "Williamsburg, VA.", "id": "e4e5e5da4fb343da89caaf74e86d0711", "startDate": "2003-07-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040030460, "id": "f43d6a6a58c14b129a804d8e8a011df6", "publicationDate": "2002-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
