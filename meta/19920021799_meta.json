The visibility that a pilot of a landing aircraft can expect is in that case the most important information. It could happen that the visibility versus the altitude is constantly decreasing or increasing. However, it is not possible to distinguish this with the existing sensors at an airport. If the visibility is decreasing with the altitude, one has the worst case - ground fog. The standard visibility sensor, the transmissometer, determines only the horizontal visual range, which will be underestimated in comparison with the real visibility a pilot has on his landing approach. Described here is a new technique to measure the slant visual range, making use of a slant scanning device - an eye-safe laser radar. A comparison with commercial visibility sensors shows that it is possible to measure visibilities with the slant looking laser radar in the range from 50 meters up to 2000 meters and even distinguish inhomogenities like ground fog.", "title": "Trial of a slant visual range measuring device", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920021799, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Streicher, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fuer Luft- und Raumfahrt", "location": "Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"}}, "id": "e9374edd7ea04eb2b314d90b7bcab3be"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920021799, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Muenkel, C."}, "organization": {"name": "Impulsphysik G.m.b.H., Hamburg, Germany", "location": "F.R. , United States"}}, "id": "c23ef8f3611c44fba92e40a4f253f4e9"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920021799, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Borchardt, H."}, "organization": {"name": "Deutscher Wetterdienst, Hamburg, Germany", "location": "F.R. , United States"}}, "id": "dffe409d8ac44622852cc1327d3e937c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920021799, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920021799, "id": "04291f5e3b4a45a4a064d510099407e2", "publicationName": "NASA.
