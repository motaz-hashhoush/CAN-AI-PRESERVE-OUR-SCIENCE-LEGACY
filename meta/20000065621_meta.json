Thomas, P.G. Vekilov, D.C. Carter, A.M. Holmes, W.K. Widierow and the Author, the team with expertise in physics, biochemistry, crystallography and engineering. Impurities inhomogeneously trapped by a growing crystal - e.g., producing sectorial structure and/or striations - may induce macroscopic internal stress in it if an impurity molecule has slightly (less than 10%) different shape or volume than the regular one(s) they replace. We tested for the first time plasticity and measured Young modulus E of the triclinic, not cross-linked lysozyme by triple point bending technique. Triclinic lysozyme crystals are purely elastic with E similar or equal to 1/5 (raised dot) 10 (exp 9) partial derivative yn/sq cm. The strength limit, sigma (sub c) similar or equal to 10 (exp -3)E similar or equal to Epsilon (sub c), where sigma (sub c) and epsilon (sub c) are critical stress and strain, respectively. Scaling E and sigma (sub c) with the lattice spacing suggests similar binding stiffness in inorganic and biomolecular crystals. The inhomogeneous internal stress may be resolved in these brittle crystals either by cracking or by creation of misoriented mosaic blocks during, not after growth. If each impurity molecule induces in the lattice elementary strain epsilon (sub 0) similar or equal to 3 (raised dot) 10 (exp -2) (this is maximal elementary strain that can arise at the supersaturation DELTA mu/kT similar or equal to 2 and macroscopic molecular concentration difference between subsequent macrolayers or growth sectors is partial derivativeC similar or equal to 5 (raised dot) 10 (exp -3), the internal strain epsilon similar or equal to epsilon (sub 0) partial derivative C similar or equal to 10 (exp -4). Mosaic misorientation resolving such strain is approximately 30 arcsec. Tenfold increase of impurity concentration may cause cracking. Estimates of stress in an isometric sectorial crystal show that lysozyme crystals can tolerate the stress till the size of 0.5mm. Dissolving mosaic lysozyme crystal shows that the mosaicity, indeed, is absent below that size.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Italy", "submissionId": 20000065621, "name": "Microgravity Research and Applications in Physical Science and Biotechnology", "location": "Sorrento", "id": "cb0aeb95bcc44b1ca4016d199f50f39c", "startDate": "2000-09-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000065621, "id": "e4cca284b9da4fb1b01f0ec53906535e", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000065621.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000065621/downloads/20000065621.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000065621/downloads/20000065621.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000065621/downloads/20000065621.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
