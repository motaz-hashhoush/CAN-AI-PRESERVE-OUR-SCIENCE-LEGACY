THOMPSON\nSPACE STATION PROGRAM OFFICE\nNASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER\n\nthe Space Station is being defined as a multi-purpose facility with emphasis in the following areas:\no Scientific and Technology Research Laboratory\no Permanent Observatory\n\'\n\n\' ** \xe2\x80\xa2\n\no Spacecraft Servicing Facility\n\n-\n\n.. "\n\n,\n\no Construction and Assembly Facility\no Manufacturing Facility\no Transportation Node\no Staging Base for Future Space Endeavors\nThe Station complex, in its initial operating capability configuration,\nincludes a continuously habitable manned element, a polar orbiting unmanned\nplatform, and a second unmanned platform co-crbiting with the manned element.\nAll elements are dependent on the Space Transportation System (STS) for initial\nplacement on-orbit and for subsequent logistical services. The manned element\nwill be designed for long duration operations with systems maintainable onorbit and operationally autonomous from ground control. A major feature of the\nStation will be its adaptability to evolutionary technology upgrades. And, the\nSpace Station, as a system, is to be designed for maximum ease of use by its\nUsers.\nThe Station is being designed to requirements principally defined by\ncurrently identified potential users, both domestic and international. Future\nendeavors are less well-defined but are being considered in a secondary manner.\nIt is probable that primary consideration of these potential large-scale future\nendeavors would place design driver requirements on the Station and, because of\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n84\n\nresource limitations, might erode expected accommodations for other Users.\nIndeed, the development of a Space Station with the currently defined multipurpose character and growth accommodations as a service facility within the\nprescribed budget is a major challenge.\nA reference Station configuration was devleoped by NASA as part of the\nRequest for Proposal preparation activity. This currently serves as the\nProgram baseline pending results from the 21-month contractor definition\nactivity initiated in April 1985.\n\nSelection and development of implementation\n\ntechnologies are part of this activity and will address specific topics such\nas:\n\no Environmental Control Life Support System -- Closed vs.\nOpen Loop Operation?\np Automation/Robotics Appl ications\no Transparency to Technology Upgrades\no Artificial Intelligence/Expert Systems Applications\no Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle/Orbital Transfer Vehicle\no Growth. Accommodations - Extension vs. Replication\no Power Generation -- Photo-voltaic, Solar Dynamic, Nuclear\no Servicing Accommodations\no Module Design \xe2\x80\x94 Size, Radiation Shielding, Configuration, etc.\no Construction and Assembly Accommodations\no Long Duration Systems serviceability and onboard maintenance\nCurrently, NASA is trying to fully understand Space Station requirements.\nThe definition studies underway will converge and select a configuration which,\nnecessarily, will be severely constrained by budget.\n\n'
