b'uted. It can run on the largest clusters,\nand is fully scalable. This allows ISSM to\ntackle models the size of continents.\nISSM is embedded into MATLAB and\nPython, both open scientific platforms.\nThis improves its outreach within the science community. It is entirely written in\nC/C++, which gives it flexibility in its design, and the power/speed that C/C++\nallows. ISSM is svn (subversion) hosted,\non a JPL repository, to facilitate its development and maintenance.\nISSM can also model propagation of\nrifts using contact mechanics and mesh\nsplitting, and can interface to the Dakota\nsoftware. To carry out sensitivity analysis,\n\nModeled Antarctic Surface Velocity using ISSM.\n\nmesh partitioning algorithms are available, based on the Scotch, Chaco, and\nMetis partitioners that ensure equal area\nmesh partitions can be done, which are\nthen usable for sampling and local reliability methods.\nThis work was done by Eric Larour and\nJohn E. Schiermeier of Caltech, and Helene\nSeroussi and Mathieu Morlinghem of Ecole\nCentrale Paris for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

ATLAS is\nused to produce modal transient analysis\nand quasi-static analysis results (i.e., accelerations, displacements, and forces) for\nthe payload math models on a specific\nShuttle Transport System (STS) flight\n\nusing the shuttle math model and associated forcing functions. This innovation\nsolves the problem of coupling of payload math models into a shuttle math\nmodel. It performs a transient loads\nanalysis simulating liftoff, landing, and all\nflight events between liftoff and landing.\n\nATLAS utilizes efficient and numerically\nstable algorithms available in MSC/NASTRAN.\nThis work was done by Stephen Gardner, Scot\nFrere, and Patrick O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly of The Boeing Company for Johnson Space Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe Integrated Main Propulsion System (MPS) Performance Recon struction process provides the MPS\npost-flight data files needed for postflight reporting to the project integration management and key customers\nto verify flight performance. This\nprocess/model was used as the baseline\nfor the currently ongoing Space\nLaunch System (SLS) work.\n\nThe process utilizes several methodologies, including multiple software programs, to model integrated propulsion\nsystem performance through space shuttle ascent. It is used to evaluate integrated\npropulsion systems, including propellant\ntanks, feed systems, rocket engine, and\npressurization systems performance\nthroughout ascent based on flight pressure and temperature data. The latest re-\n\nvision incorporates new methods based\non main engine power balance model updates to model higher mixture ratio operation at lower engine power levels.\nThis work was done by Eduardo Lopez,\nKatie Elliott, Steven Snell, and Michael\nEvans of The Boeing Company for Johnson\nSpace Center.

MSC-25066-1\n\nPhoenix Telemetry Processor\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nPhxtelemproc is a C/C++ based\ntelemetry processing program that\nprocesses SFDU telemetry packets from\nthe Telemetry Data System (TDS). It\ngenerates Experiment Data Records\n(EDRs) for several instruments includ-\n\n30\n\ning surface stereo imager (SSI); robotic\narm camera (RAC); robotic arm (RA);\nmicroscopy, electrochemistry, and conductivity analyzer (MECA); and the optical microscope (OM). It processes both\nuncompressed and compressed teleme-\n\ntry, and incorporates unique subroutines for the following compression\nalgorithms: JPEG Arithmetic, JPEG\nHuffman, Rice, LUT3, RA, and SX4.\nThis program was in the critical path\nfor the daily command cycle of the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, September 2013\n\n'
