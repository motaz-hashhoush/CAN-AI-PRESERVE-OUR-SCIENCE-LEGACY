Based on the Generalized Method of Cells micromechanics methodology, the MAC technology has allowed Goodyear scientists and engineers to perform structural analysis of composite laminates for tires all in one step, rather than the several steps previously required. Currently, the MAC code can be used to assess and optimize composite laminates; set cord-spacing guidelines (the diameter and distance between cords may impact the overall durability of a tire); explain structural impact of geometrical configurations; and compare the behavior of the different wire constructions that make up a tire. Furthermore, the MAC software contains a built-in material database and several representative volume elements for a wider choice of composites to better represent the plies and belts in a tire. The end result of the process ultimately reduces the time spent on building, testing, and adjusting tires.", "title": "A \"Tread\" Ahead of the Competition", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:02:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080315, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080315, "isbn": "0-16-067542-1", "id": "677c459e13f24edfa94e57bbfe71d702", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2002", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080315.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080315/downloads/20020080315.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080315/downloads/20020080315.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080315/downloads/20020080315.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
