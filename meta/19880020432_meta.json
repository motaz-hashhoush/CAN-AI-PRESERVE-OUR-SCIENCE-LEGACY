The basis for the concept is the potential of using an Expert System Advisor to reduce the extreme overloading of the pilot who flies NOE mission below treetop level at approximately 40 knots while performing several other functions. The ultimate goal is to develop a Threat Expert System Advisor which provides threat information and advice that are better than even a highly experienced copilot. The results clearly show that the NOE pilot needs all the help in decision aiding and threat situation awareness that he can get. It clearly shows that heuristics are important and that an expert system for combat NOE helicopter missions can be of great help to the pilot in complex threat situations and in making decisions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880020432, "id": "7a863dcb03004f9ba388be8188f2416a", "publicationDate": "1987-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880020432.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880020432/downloads/19880020432.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880020432/downloads/19880020432.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880020432/downloads/19880020432.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
