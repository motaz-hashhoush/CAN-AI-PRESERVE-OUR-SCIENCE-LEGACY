During their extravehicular activity (EVA) on Mar. 28, Expedition 10 commander astronaut Leroy Chiao and Russian flight engineer cosmonaut Salizhan Sharipov also coordinated the hand-launch by Sharipov of a small Russian technology satellite. The crew wore Russian Orlan space suits during the 4 hr. 30 min. EVA, which they completed an hour earlier than expected. The EVA was the sixth for Chiao and the second for Sharipov. Both Expedition 10 crewmen had been outside together on Jan. 25 at the start of their six- month mission. The Expedition 11 replacement crew is to launch to the ISS Apr. 15, enabling the current crew to return to Earth Apr. 25. A detailed discussion about Chiao and Sharipov's EVA is presented.", "title": "Crew Configures ISS", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T05:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050169206, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Covault, Craig"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center", "location": "United States"}}, "id": "e5fb308a939441cdad403dc436411ebf"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050169206, "publications": [{"volume": "162", "submissionId": 20050169206, "issue": "14", "issn": "0005-2175", "id": "4bb0fea888824ce9b9b735e73e585a9c", "publicationName": "Aviation Week and Space Technology", "publicationDate": "2005-04-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
