The Act requires certain federal agencies, including NASA, to\nestablish Small Buisness Innovation Research (SBIR) programs by reserving a statutory\npercentage of their extramural research and development budgets to be awarded to small business\nconcerns for research and research and development on innovations. The purpose of the Small\nBusiness Innovation Development Act is to stimulate technological innovation; encourage small\nfirms with expertise in science and high technology to participate in government research, and\nprovide incentive for the conversion of research results .into commercial applications\nThe Act defines a umform process for implementing SBIR programs but gives each agency\nthe authority and responsibility for conducting its program to best meet its needs. Each agency\npublishes, at least once a year, a solicitation that describes its research and development needs in\nthe context of the SBIR program and requests proposals from small, high technology businesses\nThese proposals should represent the first phase of a three-phase program as defined under this\nAct.\n\n\nThe three phases of the SBIR program are defined as.\n\n\nPhase I: \t The majority of awards will be $50,000 or less for research projects to evaluate\nthe scientific and technical merit and feasibility of an idea.\nPhase II" \t As a result of Phase I, funding for those projects with the most potential will be\ncontinued. The majority of Phase II awards will be for $500,000 or less and will\nfurther develop the innovation Only Phase I contractors are eligible to complete\nfor Phase II awards.\nPhase III: \t Private-sector investment and support for any neces- sary development that will\nbring an innovation to the marketplace. Also under Phase III, federal agencies\nmay award \t non-SBIR-funded follow-on contracts for products or processes\nmeeting the mission needs of those agencies.\nIn April of \t1984, NASA issued its second SBIR program solicitation, SBIR 84-1, requesting\ninnovative \t ideas and Phase I proposals NASA accepted proposals through June 6, 1984\nEvaluation \tand ranking of proposals by the NASA staff followed receipt of proposals leading to\nthe announcement of those selected for award in September of 1984. As a result of this process,\n105 small business firms were placed under contract by NASA Centers having cognizance over\nthe technical area of work.\nPresentation of the technical abstracts which describe the nature of these projects is the main\npurpose of this report. Proprietary information is not provided in these abstracts; therefore,\ntechnical details may be missing. For this reason, this report supplies the names of individuals in\nthese small business firms who may be contacted should more information be needed on a specific\nproject It also identifies the cognizant NASA Center for each project Several indexes are also\nprovided to permit ready access to the information contained in this report.\n\nI\n\n\nTECHNICAL TOPICS\n\n\nOne key to the success of an SBIR program is the identification and description of technical\ntopics which would attract the interest of small business firms and which are important to the\nmssion and goals of the agency. In general terms, NASA plans, directs, and conducts civil\nresearch and development in both-space and aeronautics. In space, NASA\'s goals-are-to-develop\ntechnology to make operations more effective, to- enlarge the range of practical applications of\nspace technology and data, and to investigate the Earth and its immediate surroundings, the\nnatural bodies in our solar system, and the origins and physical processes of the universe. In\naeronautics, NASA seeks to improve aerodynamics, structures, engines, and overall performance\nto aircraft, to make them more efficient, more compatible with the environment, and safer.\nThe achievement of these goals involves a wide range of technical disciplines, a fact well\nrepresented by the 1984 NASA program solicitation, SBIR 84-1 That solicitation contained 157\nsubtopics which were organized into 15 technical topics. The technical topics (SBIR 84-1) are:\n01.\n02.\n03\n04.\n05.\n06.\n07.\n08.\n09.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14\n15.\n\nAeronautical Propulsion and Power\nAerodynamics and Acoustics\n \n\nAircraft Systems, Subsystems, and Operations\n\n\nMaterials and Structures\nTeleoperators and Robotics\nComputer Sciences and Applications\nInformation Systems and Data Handling\nInstrumentation and Sensors\nSpacecraft Systems and Subsystems\nSpace Power\nSpace Propulsion\nHuman Habitability and Biology in Space\nQuality Assurance, Safety, and Check-Out for Ground and Space Operations\nSatellite Communications\nMaterials Processing, Micro-Gravity and Commercial Applications in Space\n\nIt can be observed that certain topics support aeronautics goals while others support goals in\nspace systems technology. A number of topics, 04, 06, 07, and 08, apply to both aeronautics and\nspace.\nNASA required that proposals be directed to a specific subtopic within a technical topic in\norder to assure responsiveness to NASA needs Future solicitations will contain technical topics\nand subtopics reflecting changing Agency interests.\n\nREVIEW AND EVALUATION OF PHASE I PROPOSALS\nPhase I proposals were judged on a competitive basis in several steps All were screened to\nensure that they meet stated solicitation requirements Proposals were then reviewed to determine\nwhether they responded to the subtopic chosen by the proposer. Those found to be responsive\nwere then evaluated by scientists or engineers knowledgeable in the topic area, using the criteria\nlisted below Selections were made by NASA based on those evaluations and consideration of\nsuch other factors as possible duplication of other research, program balance, and the availability\nof funds.\nThe evaluation criteria applied to Phase I proposals were\n1. \tThe scientific/technical quality of the Phase I research proposal and its relevance to the\nproposal\'s stated objectives, with special emphasis on its innovation and originality\n2 \t Qualifications of the principal investigator, other key staff, and consultants, if any, and\nthe adequacy of available or obtainable instrumentation and facilities\n3. \t Anticipated benefits, technical and/or economic, including potential for commercial\napplications, of the proposed research (Phase I and Phase II), if successful\n4 \t Adequacy of the proposed work plan to show progress toward meeting the objectives of\nthe Phase I effort\nReviewers based their conclusions only on information contained in the proposal.\n2\n\nPHASE IIOF SBIR\n \n\nOnly Phase I awardees have the option of proposing for a Phase II continuation of their work\nin the SBIR program. Expected funding levels may permit approximately one-third of the Phase I\nprojects to proceed into Phase II\nEvaluation of proposals for Phase II will consider their technical and scientific ment and\nfeasibility; the results of the Phase I work; the eventual value of the product process, or technology\nto the mission of NASA; the validity of the project plans for achieving stated goals; the ability of\nthe project team; and the availability of required equipment and facilities.\nFor proposals of approximately equivalent ment judged according to the criteria listed above,\nNASA will give special consideration to Phase II proposals providing a contingent commitment\nfor follow-on funding from non-federal sources. The commitment must provide that a specific\namount of Phase III funding will be made to or by the small business and indicate the date the\nfunds will be made available. The proposal must also contain any specific technibal objectives\nupon which the funding commtment has been made contingent by its provider. The form of the\ncommitment must be satisfactory to NASA to receive extra consideration. The terms of the\nfunding commitment cannot be contingent upon the obtaining of a patent due to the length of time\nthis process requires. The commitment shall be submitted with the Phase 11 proposal In addition,\nthe making of awards for Phase 11 will consider any special programmatic or schedule needs of\nNASA and, of course, the availability of funds.\n\nABSTRACTS OF AWARDS\nThe abstracts of the Phase I awards in the NASA SBIR program are listed under the technical\ntopics identified in the solicitation (SBIR 84-1) They are identified by a proposal number in which\nthe first four digits are the subtopic number.

Substantial resources\nhave been invested in developing new technologies for aerodynamic design,\naeroacoustic performance, aerodynamic structural design, power generation and power\ntransmission. In propeller design, prediction codes are available to assist design\nengineers However, optimization of the design requires manual manipulation of the\npropeller configuration guided by experience and intuition. This project addresses an\nautomated aerodynamic design code by combining a prediction code and a numerical\noptimization procedure Phase I will demonitrate the feasibility of the design procedure\nby optimizing the twist distribution of the blades Aerodynamic efficiency of the\npropeller will be chosen as the objective function in this phase of the study In Phase II,\nthe capabilities of the code will be enhanced according to the needs of NASA and the\naerospace industry. Multiple parameter optimization, including blade sweep and chord\ndistribution, can be incorporated Beyond the scope of the Phase II work, it is possible\nto select other objective functions such as the level of acoustic noise.

The uniqueness of the approach lies in the fact that\nReynolds numbers of practical interest will be used, a feat which should be easy to\naccomplish within the framework of the Wiener-Hermite method. Numerical\nsimulation of three different approach-to-isotropy flowfields is proposed. Detailed\ncomparisons with experimental data will be made to assess accuracy of the\nWiener-Hermite expansion.

ARC\nAbktract: Most of the numerical codes for solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations or\nthe Euler equations in use today are based on finite difference schemes. Most of these\nschemes are linear. Nonlinear schemes, however, have more desirable properties such\nas monotone preserving, increased accuracy, and improved stability. Thus numerical\nsolutions based on the nonlinear schemes avoid the spurious oscillations at shock\nwaves For linear schemes such as MacCormack\'s scheme, artificial dissipation is\nrequired for stability and to damp out the spurious oscillations. While nonlinear\nschemes are superior to linear schemes, they are also much more expensive to execute\non a computer. Typically, a nonlinear scheme requires about an order of magnitude\nmore computer time than a linear scheme It is this increased cost that has prevented the\ndevelopment and utilization of better nonlinear schemes. This project concerns a\nprogram to develop, aprocedure whereby the execution of a nonlinear scheme can be\nmade just as rapidly and efficiently as for a linear scheme.\n\n8\n\n\n\nProposal Number: 02.02 0794\n\n\nProject Title: Fuselage Shapes for Natural Laminar Flow (NLF)\n\n\nCompany: \tVIGYAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, INC.\n28 RESEARCH DRIVE\nHAMPTON, VA 23666\nPrincipal Investigator: VAN DAM, CORNELIS P\nContract Number: NAS1-17926\n\nAmount- $48,866\n\nNASA Center: LARC\n\nAbstract: Excellent opportunities exist for reducing the drag of:aircraft by increasing the extent of\nlaminar boundary-layer flow over the configuration Recent technological advances in\nairplane construction techniques and materials employing bonded and milled aluminum\nskins and composite materials allow for the production of aerodynamic surfaces without\nsignificant roughness and waviness, permitting long runs of natural \'laminar flow\n(NLF).

The concept development will utilize an integrated multi-element airfoil\nsystem to be designed to form a slot between the upper and lower surface in the\nturbulent recovery regions. This slot brings higher energy air from the lower surface to\nre-energize the turbulent boundary layer on the upper surface. Also because of the\ninteraction of the elements formed by this slot, there are added benefits in reducing the\nonset of turbulent ,boundary layer separation. The pressure at the trailing edge of the\nmain element is reduced while the maximum velocities on the flap are reduced Both\nthese effects reduce the total pressure rise in the recovery regions.

LARC\n\nAbstract \t The problem of control design for large space structures (LSS) is very demanding for\nseveral reasons: (1) the true description of the flexible modes of LSS is infinite\ndimensional, (2) structural damping is low, (3) tracking and pointing accuracy\nrequirements are very high, and (4) component failures are to be tolerated by the control\nsystem The use of control synthesis methods developed previously (both classical and\nmodem) has not been very successful due to the above difficulties Phase I research will\ninvestigate a new promising technique which can successfully address all the above\nproblems. The control synthesis approach is based on the factorization of the system\ntransfer function and produces a family of stable controllers which can all stabilize the\nsystem The Phase I effort will be devoted to further developments of the theory and\nnumerical algorithms\nProposal Number. 09 02 1753A\nProject Title Thermal Transport System Using Conformal Heat Exchanger\nCompany \t APPLIED TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES\n\n\nP 0.

These modules may be allowed to rotate or\n33\n\ngimbal, and the thermal transport system would have to accomodate such motion. A\nthermal transport system addressing this need would feature a-fluid to fluid contact heat\nexchanger having pressure activated compliant skins for low thermal contact-resistance\nand a compact dual fluid swivel This system is capable of full rotation and gimbal\nmotion. It can be mated and demated-several times without the use of tools and without\ndecoupling fluid lImes The objectives of the effort are to demonstrate the system\nhardware and identify areas for improvement. Toward these ends, the work in Phase I\nwill consist of an analysis to predict performance, appropriate detail design, fabrication\nand test of the proposed hardware Initial analysis indicates heat transfer rates of 480\nBTU/HR- 0F (250 Watts/\xc2\xb0C) per square foot of heat exchanger frontal area is expected at\nlow fluid flow rates\nProposal Number 09 04 9450\nProject Title: Electrochromic Panels for Control of Radiant Energy Transfer\nCompany \t EIC LABORATORIES, INC.\n111 DOWNEY STREET\nNORWOOD, MA 02062\nPrincipal Investigator. RAUH, R DAVID\nContract Number: NAS8-35267 Amount: $49,595 NASA Center: MSFC\nAbstract. Since heat transfer in space is largely radiative, the emissivity of the surfaces linking the\npayload to the space environment are key to the problem of temperature stabilization\nand control in orbiting spacecraft This project considers the design and fabrication of\nsurfaces which would have variable thermal infrared ermssivity. Control is achieved by\npassage of a small dc electrical current through the panel and is based on the concept of\n"electrochronmsm" in thin films of some metal oxides, such as W0 3 and IrO2 When\ncrystalline films of these materials are reduced electrochemically by incorporation of\nhydrogen or alkali metals, they undergo an increase in reflectivity proportional to the\ncharge passed. It is intended for Phase I to prepare thin films of W0 3 with high\ncrystalline perfection, and to measure spectroscopically the infrared reflectance\nmodulation out to 50 microns for HxWO 3 as a function of x The resulting emissivities\nwill be used in simple models of heat transfer in satellites to predict the extent of\nthermal control that could be achieved during orbit. A small self-contained variable\nemissivity element will be constructed during Phase I and will serve as a basis for Phase\nII research and development Phase II and subsequent commercial development would\naddress the detailed construction of larger area panels, optimization of reflective\nelectrochromic materials, and long-term degradation mechanisms of integrated\nstructures\nProposal Number. 09.05 1504\nProject Title: Electronic Component Temperature Control Using Metal-Matrix Composites\nCompany: \tDWA COMPOSITE SPECIALTIES, INC.\n21119 SUPERIOR STREET\nCHATSWORTH, CA 91311-4393\nPrincipal Investigator SUPAN, EDWARD C\nContract Number: NAS3-24245 Amount: $49,818 NASA Center- LERC\nAbstract- This Phase I program is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of producing a\nlightweight metal-matrix composite (MMC) heat-removal bar having the thermal\nconductivity of copper and to show, by mechanical and physical-property tests, that this\nMMC is a useful material for heat transfer in space and avionics applications.

Furthermore,\nthis membrane unit will act as a bamer to protect the rest of the post-treatment train\n43\n\n\n\nshould the phase-change subsystem fail The Phase I program will determine the\nfeasibility of using these RO membrane modules for post-treatment applications by\ntesting them on synthetic and actual distillates The Phase I effort would begin to\ndevelop flight hardware.\nProposal Number: 12.01 8371\nProject Title.

A color schlieren system produces data more amenable to detailed\nanalysis than a standard schlieren system, and since white light sources are more\nenergy-efficient than lasers, it should be possible with this system to study larger\nsamples under the limited power conditions of flight than has been possible with earlier\nsystems. This project therefore develops and builds a small prototype color schlieren\nsystem and tests it on the NASA KC-135 low gravity simulation aircraft. Its suitability\nfor microgravity materials processing applications such as crystal growth and biological\nexperiments requiring simple flow visualization are evaluated, laying the ground work\nfor development of a large scale system.\n\nProposal Number. 15.03 7039\nProject Title: Ultrafine Particle Production in Micro-Gravity\nCompany: \tENERGY SCIENCE LABORATORIES, INC.\n\n\n11404 SORRENTO VALLEY ROAD\n\n\nSUITE 113\n\n\nSAN DIEGO, CA 92121\n\n\nPrincipal Investigator: WEBB, GEORGE W\nContract Number: NAS8-35279 Amount. $49,623 NASA Center\' MSFC\nAbstract. Ultrafine particles or powder can be prepared by evaporating material into an inert gas\natmosphere The vapor is cooled by the inert gas and becomes supersaturated, leading\nto particle condensation. However, convection of the inert gas is a severe problem,\ncausing the particles to coalesce into a fewer number of larger particles Analysis\nsuggests that particle production by this technique in micro-gravity has unique\nadvantages This effort will (1) investigate appropriate heating methods, (2)\nanalytically model the particle condensation process, and (3)develop particle collection\nmethods.\n\nProposal Number: 15.04 7840\nProject Title: Lunar Oxygen Production from Iinenite\nCompany \t CARBOTEK, INC\n2916 WEST T.C JESTER\nHOUSTON, TX 77018\nPrincipal Investigator: GIBSON, MICHAEL A.\nContract Number: NAS9-17287 Amount: $50,000 NASA Center.

Phase I results should enable design of\ncontinuous prototype experiments in Phase II to demonstrate process feasibility Phase\nII would include design of Phase III Shuttle bay tests of critical components to confirm\nperformance for lunar gravity, vacuum and heat transfer conditions.\nProposal Number. 15 04 7840A\nProject Title: Aspen Simulations-Lunar Oxygen Production Facility\nCompany: \tCARBOTEK, INC\n\n\n2916 WEST T C.

JSC\n\nAbstract: Lunar oxygen production by direct hydrogen reduction of ilmenite and vapor-phase\nelectrolysis of resultant water vapor appears the most promising method. The\nprelirmnary ASPEN simulation model to be developed will be based on the assumption\nof mining ilmenite or removing it from a mare pit using a bucket-wheel excavator\nfeeding a shiftable conveyor system; beneficiation of the ilmenite ore by sieving,\nelectrostatic sizing, magnetic separation, and electrostatic separation, processing of the\nconcentrated ilmenite ore by continuous fluid-bed reduction to produce water vapor\nwhich is electrolyzed to product oxygen and recycled hydrogen; and liquefaction and\nstorage of product oxygen for future transport to user facilities The Phase I effort\ninvolves- (1) the development of the preliminary flowsheet for the overall mining,\nbeneficiation, processing, and recovery scheme, (2) the development of the ASPEN\nmodel based on the preliminary flowsheet, (3) preliminary costing and economic\nevaluation of the overall scheme, and (4) recommendations for further upgrading of the\nmodel by improving design, physical property and costing data. Phase I results would\nbe extended in greater detail in Phase II to optimize the choices of conceptual\nequipment and their combination to confirm the feasibility of an effective overall\nprocess Promising Phase II results would justify major engineenng/cost estimating and\nlunar production planning in a following Phase III program\nProposal Number 15.05 7606\nProject Title: The Large Format Camera: Novel Analyses of Sensor Applications\nCompany-\t AUTOMETRIC, INC\n5205 LEESBURG PIKE\n\n\nSUITE 1308/SKYLINE 1\n\n\nFALLS CHURCH, VA 22041\n\n\nPrincipal Investigator: LUCAS, CARROLL\nContract Number NAS8-35280\n\nAmount $49,357\n\nNASA Center.

This project will (a) investigate the utility of\nseveral film reproduction techniques including reproductions from the individual\nemulsion layers of the color and color IR films, (b) investigate the feasibility of\ncombining the LFC cartographic and multi-spectral hardcopy products with other\nsensor products, and (c) analyze the multispectral aspects of film products by
