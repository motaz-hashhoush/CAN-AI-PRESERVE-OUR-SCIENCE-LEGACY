The Geodetic requirement for contour mapping of\nthe world oceans and the scientific requirement of contour mapping of remote\nplanets have led to proposed satellite radar for these purposes.\nThis tutorial document reviews basic radar requirements for such missions.\nThe concepts of pulse type radars when applied to satellite-to-planet geometry\nare not the same as when the radar to target distance is a few kilometers. However, if the differences are recognized, the radar properly designed, and the data\nsystem of sufficient capacity, contours of one (1) meter can be measured, sea\nstates can be recognized and surface wind velocities over water can be determined. On the other hand the detection of ocean wave shapes, surface irregularities of less than a few centimeters, and small transient events require\nextremely accurate ? r3ars with per pulse errors less than one (1) meter. Conventional systems with extreme accuracies that qualify for space use may be in\nthe future. However with the present day limitations of antenna size, realizable\npulse lengths and satellite heights much of the desired information will have to\nbe developed from return pulse shape stilly and analysis. To derive the desired\ninformation the transmitted pulse shape must be known, the effects of the receiver, detector and data systems upon the return pulse must be understood.\nThis document explains some of these effects.\nV11\n\nThe effects of the reflecting surface upon the return pulse shape must be\nevaluated by in flight tests. The ability of a radar to determine altitude from\nthe distorted return can only be determined by calibration of in flight equipment.\nThese evaluations and calibrations will be conducted during the GEOS-C program. \t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n5\t\n\nViii\n\n,\n\nSATELLITE ALTIMETRY\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\nRadar with its ability to penetrate clouds and accurately map contours is one\nof the few instruments which c-Ann be used to study the topography of a planet.\nAirborne radars have successfully mapped much of the terrain of planet earth.\nA space borne radar in the proper orbit could successfully complete the terrain\nt\n\nmapping and also map the world oceans. Venus, our closest neighbor planet is\nstill somewhat of a mystery. The reason \xe2\x80\x94 perpetual cloud cover. A properly\ndesigned radar placed in orbit around a planet could measure the vertical profile\nto an accuracy of several meters. The radar would weigh less than 100 pounds\nand operate at a wavelength of 15 centimeters or less. Shorter wavelengths can\nbe used for higher resolving capability in earth orbit. However the "atmosphere"\nnear Venus precludes the use of much shorter wavelengths. The choice of wavelength will be dictated by such features as planet atmosphere and desired resolving capability. The radar would determine the contour of the planet to be observed\nfrom an altitude of 1500 kilometers or less above the surface. A range tracking\nloop will be included for altitude tracking and this data used to improve the orbit\ndetermination around the planet under observation. Basically the orbit determination will be made using earth based tracking systems. The added parameter\nof vertical height above the planet should improve the orbit determination.\n\n1\n\n2.0 THEORY OF ALTITUDE DETERNIINATION\nThe basic function of the satellite radar altimeter is to determine the height\nof the satellite relative to the subsatellite point on the planet. However due to\nsurface irregularities the subsatellite point is not uniquely defined. To establish\nthe physical interpretation of the height measurement, the subsatellite point 4s\ndefined as the intersection of the spherical electromagnetic wavefront and a plane\ntangent to the planet at the nadir.\nIn Figure 1, the geometrical configuration of the satellite radar observations\nis illustrated. The Latellite radar transmits a spherical shell (within the antenna\nbeam) of radio energy whose thickness is the pulse length (T) multiplied by the\nvelocity of propagation (c) and the two-way propagation factor of one half. The\nspherical shell may be visualized as having a constant thickness of c7-/2 independent of the radius of the sphere. The reflection of this spherical shell from\nthe plane of the planet surface produces an inverted shell whose cross sectional\nradius increases with time and whose radar cross sectional area reaches a maximum when the trailing edge of the incident shell is tangent to the plane of the planet\nsurface. After this maximum cross-sectional area has been attained the subsequent area responsible for reflecting radio energy takes the form of annular rings\nwhich are concentric with the initial area.\n\n2\n\nt\n\nSATELLITE\nHALF POWER\t\nANTENNA BEAMWIDTH\niRE\'\'!

Thus the angular resolution is determined by the\nradar pulse width and the systen, is pulse width limited. Thus the resolution\n.\n\nis in the order of several minutes of are for nominal orbit heights above the\nplanet.\nThis high angular resolution permits the assumption of a plane surface for\nthe planet reflecting area involved and leads to the following assumptios:\n(1) all trigonometric functions of the angles involved may be equated to\nthe angle\n(2) the reflectivity of the interrogated surface is constant over the reflecting\narea on a per pulse basis\n(3) the antenna gain is a constant and equal to the "on-axis" gain.\nThe first assumption results in the reflected spherical shell being converted to\na conical shell which simplifies the analysis and does not affect the results. The\nsecond and third assumptions imply equal incident power and equal reflected\npower at all points within the interrogated surface.\n2.1 RADAR EQUATION\nThe power received by the radar receiver is given by\n\nPr \xc2\xb0\t\n\nPt\n\nG2k2010A\n\n(4 7r)3 ha\n\n4\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\nwhere\nPr\n\n= received power per pulse\n\nPt = transmitter power per pulse\nX rh\n\naO\n\noperating electromagnetic wavelength\n\n= vertical height above the planet\n= reflectivity of the interrogated surface\n\nA = reflecting area of the interrogated surface\n\nAs seen in Figure 1, the maximum reflecting are at is 7r c T h and is a function\nof time within the pulse where\nA=7rch t i 0 <ti < T *\t\n\n(\n\n2)\n\nSubstituting Equation 2 into 1, the received power\n\t\no\t\n\nPt\nt\t\n\n\tP=\nr\t\n\nct\t\n\n()\n\n1 pct\n\n<T\t\n\n64.n2 h3\n\nAs can be seen from Equation 3, for a constant height (h) the return pulse is a\nlinear function of time up co the point\n\nti\n\n= T.\n\nThis is shown graphically in\n\nFigure ? for vertical incidence.

I"ized transmit and received altimeter pulse\n2.2 EFFECT OF TRANSMITTER PULSE SHAPE\n\nIn the previous sections we have been dealing with an idealized rectangular\ntransmitter pulse. Since practical systems have a finite rise time it is worthwhile to obtain some information regarding various transmitter pulse shapes.\nEquation 3 may be written in th4, form\nPr (t) = K Pt (t) A\n\n6\n\n\t\n\n(4)\n\nt^\n\nwhere K 1 includes all the constants of the system of Equation 3 and A is defined\nIn Equation 3. For the given pulse width T\n\nPr = A (t i )\t\n\nKi Pt (t) d t\t\n\n(5)\n\nwhere t is measured from the onset of the received pulse. The received pulse\npowers as a function of time for several transmitter pulse shapes are shown in\nFigure 3.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2ca. btt -, sa\n\nFigure 3. Average shape of ocean returns vs transmitted shop*\n\n7\n\nThe transmitter pulse uhapes of Figure 3 are the idealized shapes. Practical\ncircuitry prohibits vertical (zero time) rise and fall times as well as abrupt discontinuities. The output of a T:mised magnetron approaches 3a. The rise and fall\ntimes of a magnetron are limited by the cavity design and the electron density.\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6\t\n\nI\n\nPresent state of the art magnetrc- s have rise and fall times in the e_der of a\nfew (less than ten) nanoseconds\nThe use of extremely short pulse widths results in much the same problems\nwhether a system uses pulse compression or a standard pulse system. It is not\npossible in a pulsed transmitter to generate an ideal Fourier spectrum that results\nin a prefect pulse in the time domain. Finite circuit passbands and nonlinear\nphase characteristics prevent time domain pulses from being uniformly treated\nin the frequency domain. Because of the wide frequency spectrum associated\nwith short pulses the problem of generation and amplification is made difficult.\nEarly pulse compression systems achieved the goal of extremely short\n(approximately one nanosecond) pulses but they also generated discontinuities\nor side lobes. These side lobes were only 10 to 15 dB below main pulse. This\nlimited the usefulness of the pulse compression systems for high resolution\nbackscatter measurements. The echo from one scatter could easily be distorted\nby a side lobe from a second close by scatterer and there is no way to separate\nthese pulses in amplitude or time.\n\n8\ni\n\nR\n_.j\n\nZ\n\nPulse shaping techniques, broadband circuitry and very linear phase responses\nhave reduced the , ide lobe level in pulse compression system to resonable values.\nWith the advent of Traveling Wave Tubes (TWT) almost any pulse shape can\nbe transmitted. However highly efficient, broadband (greater than 200 MHz)\nTWT\'s are at present beyond the state of the art. TWT\'s with greater than 1 GHz\nbandwidth are available "off the shelf" however the d.c. to r.f. efficiency of these\ntubes is low and none have been space qualified. TWT\'s have been built and\neffectively used in ground installations up to 500 kw autput at X-band, however\nspace qualified units are limited to one or two kilowatts and approximately 200\nMHz bandwidths.\nThe availabilty of TWT\'s with at least moderate power and reasonable bandwidth allow one to consider pulse compression techniques (Section 3.0) for high\nresolution. Constant gal. and linear phase over the bandpass are required of\nthe transmitter in a pulse compression system.\n2.3 RADAR RECEIVER\nThe leading edge or ramp of the received pulses directly affects the receiver\ndesign. A radar receiver will be considered as a bandpass filter having constant\noutput to a detection device.\nThe receiver noise power (P ) is expressed as KTB where K is Boltzmans\nconstant, T the effective receiver temperature in degrees Kelvin and B is the\n9\n\nreceiver noise bandwidth. The effective noise bandwidth of the receiver filter\ncan be expressed\n\n3 a constant times the half power (3 db) band width; it also can\n\nbe expressed as a constant times 1/-r. Except for a difference in the filter\nresponse the gain of the receiver is the same for both signal and noise.\nThe receiver filtering shapes the response to the average power return, limits\nthe receiver noise power, and determines the natural frequency of the noisy\nvariation about the average return. The receiver bandwidth must be at least as\nwide as the reciprocal of the pulse time to respond to the ramp type return\ndefined previously. Bandwidths exactly this narrow however will alter the\nwaveform and widening this bandwidth increases the noise power. A good\ncompromise for the receiver bandwidth is still\n\nB = 21-r\t\n\n(6)\n\nHowever, it must be recognized that this choice eliminates some of the information\nthat could be obtained under high signal to noise ratios. The filter (receiver)\nbandwidth requirements for a pulse compression are based upon the dispersed\npulse frequency spread. However, care must be exercised in the circuit design\nso that the gain and phase characteristics are linear or compensated.\n\n2.3.1 Doppler Considerations\n\ni\n\nIf the observing satellite is in a perfect circular orbit about a perfect\nspherical planet the frequency offset (Doppler) due to a change in height would\n10\n\ni\nI\n\nbe neglected in the receiver design.* Eccentricity of the orbit results in a height\nchange with time. This radial velocity results in a frequency offset (Doppler)\nwhich is readily calculated using the standard Doppler equation\n\n/\n\nf = ft\t (1 -\t\n\nc-v\nc+\n\nrl\t\n\n(7)\n\nyr\n\nwhere y r is the rate of change of the height (ho). This rate of change is deter-\n\nmined by the orbit eccentricity and varies throughout the orbit. For a spherical\nplanet\nh\xc2\xb0 = ev sin tit \t\n\n(8)\n\nwhere a is the eccentricity, v is the velocity al-)ng the orbit and q is the positional\nangle with respect to the line of nodes at periapsis measured in the direction of\nthe orbit. In a frequency coherent radar this frequency component is tracked\nout and the return signal is maintained centered in the i . f. filter. Early space\nborne altimeters cannot afford the weight and power required for the luxury of this\ncircuit complexity, thus the receiver must be designed to accommodate a Doppler\noffset without causing the signal to . stray into the filter skirts.\n\n^ fferances from returns near the edge of the interrogated area do exist. But due to the\n** Dopp[eri\nsmall resolving area this component can be neglected for radars at 3 cm or greater wavelengths\nand nanosecond pulses.\n\n11\n\n2.3.2 Other Effects\nOther factors also enter into the selection of the receiver bandwidth. Since\nthe radar receiver will be of the heterodyning type, consideration must be given\nto the local oscillator frequency long term drift. (Short term drift or phase\nnoise will be discussed later.)- With the availability of state-of-the-art stable\ncrystal oscillators this may not be a serious consideration. However, the\nstability requirement in light of the filter bandpass should not be neglected.\nIf the radar includes a pulsed magnetron, the frequency stability of the\nmagnetron must be considered in the selection of the receiver bandpass\ncharacteristics.\nWhen a radar antenna is scanned over several beamwidths or when the\nsatellite attitude is not closely controlled, the received signal may be spread in\nfrequency. This may be attributed to the amplitude modulation of the two-way signal\nas the addition of a velocity component since the radar no longer views vertically\ndown. Steinberg developed an equation for this spectum spreading (0) for a\nMoving Target Indicator (MTI) radar as\n\nw\n3.8 B\n\nwhere E is the beam width being scanned equal to 2 Ye- and &; is the scan\n-rh\nrate or is the attitude drift rate of the spacecraft.\n\n12\n\n(9)\n\n2.4 DETECTION PROCESSER\nAs stated previously a coherent system is precluded as being too complex\nfor the initial radar altimeters. Non-coherent 0 3tectors fall in two categories\nwhich describe the input-output characteristics of the mechanism. The linear\ndetector can be described as having a linear relationship between input si,,nal\nvoltage and resulting detector output voltage. The rectangular transmitted pulse\nshown in Figure 2 is once again depicted in Figure 4, however the return pulse\nis now depicted as the output of a linear detector. It is noted that the rise is not\nlinear yet still extends for the pulse period\n\n-r.\n\n2\nPr\n\n_-a.\n0\t\n\nIT\t\n\n3T\t\n\n2T\t\n\n4T\t\n\n5T\n\nt\nNASA-GSFC-TBDS\nMISSION a TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS DIVISION\nDATE 6/19170\nBRANCH 551\t\nBY J. W. BRYAN\t\nPLOT NO. X88\n\nFigure 4. Characteristic radar altimeter return (envelope detection. AGC on return)\n\nThe square law detector is characterized by an output proportional to the\ninput power. The return pulse indicated in Figure 2 is then a square law detector\n\n13\n\noutput for a rectangular transmitted pulse. The returns depicted in Figure 3\nmay also be considered as outputs of square law detectors for the transmitter\npulse shapes indicated.\nIn the pulse compression systems the detection process follows the compression network. Therefore the same detection criteria applies.\n2.5 ALTITUDE DETERMINATION\nFor the unmanned satellite the on-board altimeter must contain some\nautomated method of determining the radar range. The exact method of determination will be dictated by the measurement accuracy required and type of information dertired. Also included in the altitude determination is the data transmission capability available.\nThe altitude (range) of the satellite above the surface of the planet is determined by measuring the two-way transit time of the electromagnetic energy.\nR_ck\t\n2\n\nwhere\t\n\nR is the radar range or altitude\nC is velocity of propagation\nt is the two-way propagation time.\n\nIt is immediately seen that a quantization error of f1 clock count must be\napplied to the altitude determination since\n14\n\n(10)\n\n:y\nt\n\n\t\nAR=cAt\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere D : is the clock interval.\nSince the rise time of the transmitted pulse is several orders of magnitude\nsmaller that the clock rate, the clock is usually started with the onset of the\ntransmitter pulse with negligible error. The clock stop pulse is generated from\nthe received pulse. For a noiseless system the clock could be stopped with the\nonset of the return pulse. However, systems are not noiseless. Several systems\nhave been developed to determine a specific time associated with the noisy return\npulse to generate the stop pulse.\nThe simplest form of altitude determination is perhaps the clock counter\ncoupled with a threshold detection device. The clock counter is started by the\nonset of the transmitter pulse. The counter will continue to count clock cycles\nuntil a stop pulse is generated by the threshold detector. The threshold detector,\nif it were not for noise etc. on the return pulse, could be a biased diode which\nfired when the ramp of Figure 2 reached some fixed voltage. The firing of this\ndiode would generate the stop pulse for the counter. Since the actual return is\nnot as depicted in Figure 2 but rather a noisy version thereof, this threshold\ndevice would fire at random points in time. In actual practice some integrating\ncould be done before the pulse was presented to the threshold device. This\nintegrator could take the form of a bandpass filter whose passband will not\n\n15\n\nallow for changes of slope at a rapid rate. However small changes in altitude\nwill be masked by this technique. In fact, any form of averaging or integration\nwill mask or average out small altitude changes. This filter coea ld also be of the\nform of a low pass post detection filter. However, some of the effect of noise\nbiasing of the detector is eliminated using pre-detection bandpass filtering.\nA second method of determining the time to generate the stop pulse is the\ndelay differencing technique. Referring to Figure 5, the received pulse is split\ninto two paths. The time delay in path (b) is made exactly\n\n(T)\n\nlonger than path\n\n(a). The two-signals are then subtracted giving the power pulse of Figure 5b.\nThe peak of this pulse is then used to generate the clock stop pulse and the Vme\nto be inserted in Equation 10 is\n\nt_t -72\n\nwhere t , is the clock counted interval.\nIt is immediately apparent that a time jitter due to noise on the return will\nalso affect the accuracy of this system.\nThere exist other techniques for developing a pulse to stop the clock\ncounter. Descriptions of these systems are available in the various radar system\nmanuals.\n\n16\n\n(a)\n\naA\n(b)\n\n^T \xe2\x96\xba^\n!\t\nI\n\nI\t\n\nOUTPUT PATH (a)\t\n\nI\n\nI\t!\t\n\n\'isT4i\n\n1\nI\n\nOUTPu t PATH (b)\t\n\nI\t\nI\t\n\ni\t\n\n!\n\nI\t\n!\t\n\nI\nI\n\n!\t\n\nDIFFERENCE (a-b)\t\n\nI\n\n;\t\n\nI\nNASA GSFC TBDS\nMISSION a TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS DIVISION\nBRANCH 551\t\n\nDATE 6119170\n\nBY J.

Delay differencing\n\n2.6 RETURN PULSE CONSIDERATIONS\nIn order to design a radar for height measurements the mecnanism of the\ndiffuse reflectors must be understood. In operation over a rough surface the\nreturn pulse is the resultant of reflections :rom all elements within the resolution area a Since the return from such a surface is a function of wavelength,\npulse length, polarization, height of surface irregularities, and reflection coefficient; the radar return is complex. If the resolution area contains many\ncontours which are larger than a *wavelength the return may be considered to be\nfrom scatterers uniformly distributed over the area. In this case, the quantity (o-0)\ntermed the "radar cross-section per unit area" is used and is independent of\n\n17\n\nmost of the radar paramstera\n\n4\n\nGrant and Yaplee obtained data that ir.3icated that\n\n(6,0 ) was approadmately proportional to the square of the frequency for sea and\nlaw returns.\n\nThe backbcattering characteristics or realistically the value of (:-\xc2\xb0) when\nthe interrogating source is a satellite is one 3f the objectives of current altimeter\nprograms. Values currently being used in radar designs var y from +20 dB for\nrelatively calm (10 knot winds) seas to zero dB for the planet Venus to -25 dB for\ntree covered terrain. A conservative value for the world ocean is +6 dB, while\n\nthe reflection measurements at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) reported by Carpenters indicate a reflectivity of +4 dB for Venus at vertical incidence and dropping\nsharply to -30 dB at 60\xc2\xb0 off vertical.\n\nA few generalizing statements are appropriate to indicate the nature of the\nscattering process_ Goldstein reported that a steady reflection from the earth\'s\nterrain could be attributed to the reflections from elements that moved V4 or\nless. He found little scintillation from a wooded area at wind spuds below appro:ximately 12 kno\'_s. Above 12 knots the return distribution followed a Rayleigh\ndistribution for random scatterers_ Grant and Yaplee ` showed that the value\nis almost independent of angle of incidence when the interrogated terrain is covered\nwith tall growth (trees, etc.) and this is also applicable to rocky terrain.\nThe values developed by Grant and Yaplee have been accepted and used\nwhen no specific data exists. it is expected that these values should be used for\nthe reflectivity of other planets until more specific data can be obtained. The\n18\n\n\t\n\nij\n\nvalue of \xc2\xb0 for the open oceans of the world is quite variable and dependent\nupon the roughness of the water. The actual value has been determined from\naircraft calculations by many observers. San plea of the published curves are\nshown in Figure 6 for the various wind speeds. These values must be verified\nwhen the interrogating source is a satellite altimeter, however, they should \'m\nused as design criteria.\n\n3\n\nDR R K MOORE (ET AL I UNIV NEW MEXICO,\nt\n3T07 KNOT WINDS\n\n\t30db\t\n\nDR R K MOORE (ET AU UNIV NEW MEXICO,\n6 TO 12 KNOT WINDS\nf ALLEN SCHOOLEY, N-RL\n15 KNOT WIND\n\n20db\t\n\nALLEN SCHOOLEY, N R.L\n20 KNOT WIND\na 15d5\nb\n1 0clb\n\nQT^_\t\n,E A THE\t\nCROSS SECTION PER\t\nIJNIT AREA (AS A\nFLINCTION OF 8),\t\n\n2 cos 8\n5cb raOOF PERFEC\nJ\n\n(SCATTER\t\n\n`\\\n0\n00\t\n\n50 100\t15\xc2\xb0 20\xc2\xb0 25\xc2\xb0 300\n8 ANGLE FROM LOCAL VERTICAL\n\nFigure 6.

The effect upon the slope of Vie :sa\'ing edge of the return pulse iias been\nstudied in reference 1. Since the rntire return pulse is the sum of the return from\nmany small reflectors, some information regarding the size and spacing of these\nreflectors can be assertamed if the reflecting surface is viewed from an angle.\nFor a static surface such as a non fluid planet or land .return the same surface\ncan be viewed from several angles and subsequent orbital passes or the antenna\nmay be scanned during any one pass.\nThis corresponds to the side looking or forward looking radars presently\nused for aircraft mapping. To gain the desired information the entire return\npulse or pulses must be available. To this end the entire radar return must be\nsampled and telemetered to the earth. The number of samples required depends\nupon the amount of information desired, the radar system resoltuion and the scan\nrate of the system. The orbital motion of the spacecraft is considered as a scan.\nIt is not necessary to sample the return for the entire Prf period. The sampling\nperiod can be adjusted automatically by the altitude tracking system and the\nperiod of sampling designed to sample only the portion of the return desired for\nstudy.\nThe design of a side looking or scanning radar mapper must consider the \t\n\n-\n\ninterrogated area. R. H. Laprade describes the radar mappar as applies to\naircraft in reference 8. Care must be exercised in applying this description\nto relate all parameters to satellite application.\n\n2.7 DATA SYSTEMS CONSIDERATIONS\nThe ability to command the tracking gates to a close approximation of the\ncorrect tracking time will be required. This will alleviate many of the design\nconstraints on the tracking loop when in the search mode. Without this capability, the tracking loop must search over an entire Prf interval. The altimeter\nshould be designed with a search and acquisition mode. In this mode, the radar\ncould transmit a rather long (i \xc2\xb5 sec or longer) pulse. As seen in equation 3\nthe received power is a direct function of the pulse length. By transmitting\na long pulse and receiving the high signal-to-noise ratio the acquisition process\nis made easier. With this high SNR and the tracking gates commander) to a\nnarrow search range acquisition should be accomplished in tenths of a second.\nSome "on-board" processing of the altitude determination must be included\nin the initial design. No data will normally be extracted from the altimeter until\nthe tracking gate is locked to the return pulse. As indicated previously, the\n\xe2\x80\xa2 effect of noise either receiver (internal) or received (external) will be to cause\nthe tracking mechanism to jitter about the correct tracking point. These noise\nvariations will be integrated out onboard over a relativeiy long interval. This\n\n21\t\n\n1\n\nexact interval is a function of the desired resolution, orbit eccentricity and the\nspeed of the subsatellite point over the surface of the planet. An altimeter with\ntenths of a meter accuracy does not give definitive information if the measurement\nis average over terrain which has varied several meters during the averaging\nperiod. Thus some idea of the contours to be mapped must be factored into the\n"on-board" processing. In mapping the mean sea level of the world oceans the\nindividual wave heights can and should be averaged out. However, in determining\nfine grain contours such as the sea state of the ocean the individual wave height\nmust be measured. Since little is known of the surface contours of the various\nplanets the initial contour mapping radars will not be high resolution but rather\nhave 20 to 50 meters resolution. With this coarser resolution longer averaging\nperiods can be tolerated. After the coarse contours of a planet have been mapped\nand analyzed the finer grain structure of the surface can be mopped on subsequent\nflights.\nThe availability of data links must be examined in relation to the radar\nresolution. It may be necessary to obtain and store data at a relatively high\nrate for playback at a lover rate. With the advent of Data Relay Satellites this\nstorage and playback may not be necessary for earth orbiting radars as real\ntime high data rate channels will be available.\nThe data processing system of any radar altimeter will depend upon several\nbasic radar parameters: 1) type of detection process, 2) type of tracking process,\n22\n\nt^\n\n3) filtering techniques, 4) signal-to-noise ratio, 5) ultimate resolution desired.\nEach of these parameters has been discussed previously in relation to the radar.\nThey will now be discussed in relation to the data processing systems.\n\nIn the non-coherent system discussed in this paper no attempt is made to\ncorrelate the phases and frec \xe2\x80\xa2 tencies of the transmitted and received signals.\nSignal returns from each prlbe are detected separately and averaged together\nafter detection (past detection integration). The block diagram of such a system\nis shown in Figure 7.\n\nBANDPASS\t\nFILTER\t\n\nR F SIGNAL\t\nINPUT\n\nINTEGRATION\t\nFILTER\t\n\n\'DETECTOR\t\n\n27-\n\nI\n\nOUTPUT\nSIGNAL\n\nNON COHERENT\n\nLOCAL OSCILLATOR\nNASA-GSFC -TBDS\n\nMISSION 9 TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS DIVISION\nBRANCH__. 51_\t\nA\nBY J. W. BRYAN\t\n\nDATE 6119170\nPLOT NO 1290\n\nFigure 1. Non coLerent detection and integration diagram\n\nAs shown by Barton this improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the output\nsignal by a factor of na , where (n) is the number of returns integrated and (a)\nmay be between 0.5 and 1.0. For low signal-to-noise ratio (a) is taken to be 0.5\nand for high signal-to-noise ratio (a) is taken as 1.0. In the initial design of a\nradar (a) is usually assumed to be 0.6. Thus non-coherent integration does not\n\n23\n\nEA\n\nmake optimum use of the system information, however, in the early stage of\nsatellite altimetry the complexity versus optimization seems to indicate the less\ncomplex system.\nIt should be noted at this time that any system losses must be included in\narriving at the signal-to-noise ratio into and out of the integrating filter. The\nimprovement factor (n a) does not include any of these losses.\nAn important factor to be considered in integrating several return pulses\nin an effort to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for altitude determination is the\ncorrelation of the surface noise. The sea (for example) at any particular point\nis ever changing, but during the observation time of a high p.r.f. satellite\naltimeter the sea is essentially frozen in position. Thus the surface clutter or\nnoise will tend to correlate from pulse to pulse throughout the integrating\nperiod and the integration does not necessarily improve the signal to clutter\nratio as happens in the case of uncorrelated noise. The decor7-elation time of\nsea clutter is stated by Croney 10 to be about 0.01 seconds at X-band frequencies.\nThe correlation of the surface clutter on a pulse to pulse basis may well\nprove an advantage when the return pulse is being sampled for surface roughness\nstudies.\n\n24\n\nt\n\n2.8 ALTIMETER RESOI?TTION\nThe ability of the radar altimeter to accurately determine the vertical\nheight variations above the sub orbital point is a function of the pulse length,\noperating frequency and range determination system. The system will never be\nable to resolve variations less than one-half the operating wavelength. The range\nresolution of the bemwidth limited radar is defined by the pulse length and\nthe net signal-to-noise ratio. For a leading edge tracker, Skoinik 11 defines\nthe range resolution as\n8TR=\n\n2BE/N o\t(\n\n12\n\n)\n\nwhere\nT - 2R/C\nT = pulse\n\nheight\n\nB = receiver noise bandwidth\nE = signal energy\nNo = noise power per unit bandwidth\nfor a transmitted pulse having a vertical (zero rise time) leading edge. Equation\n12 should be directly applicable to the satellite altimeter.\n3.0 PULSE COMPRESSION\nThe information in the previous sections as rogards detection and data\nprocessing apply equally well to pulse type and pulse compression systems. In\n\n25\n\ngeneral pulse expansion and compression networks in the transmitter and broadband receiver respectively will deliver the same signal to the measurement circuitry as a short high amplitude pulse system. Pulse compressions system may\nbe arbitrarily divided into two classes, a) passive pulse compression, and b)\nactive pulse compression. Both methods are used in present day airborne systems and could be implemented for space use.\n3.1 PASSIVE PULSE COMPRESSION\nThe passive pulse compression system is characterized by operating upon\nthe signal in a coherent manner and thus increase the resulting signal-to-noise\nratio. A simplified system is illustrated in the following way. The transmitter\npulse is swept in frequency during the time of transmission. Ideally this\nsweep would be linear with time. The received pulse is passed through a dispersive network whose delay versus frequency follows exactly the transmitter\nsweep but with a reverse spectram. This may be seen in Figure 8.\nA second illustration is given in Figure 9. A spike of r.f. energy is generated\nby discharging an energy storage device such as avalanching a diode in a\ncavity. This spike is fed to a dispersive delay where the various frequency\ncomponents of the energy spike are delayed according to the delay versus frequency characteristics of the network. This decompressed pulse is then transmitted. The return pulse is fed through the same dispersive network, after\nreversing the spectrum, and ideally the original spike is obtained.

Most of these, however,\nrequire some manual sweep adjustments for correlation which are deemed too\ncomplex for the state-of-the-art in automated spacecraft.\n3.2 ACTIVE PULSE COMPRESSION\nThe active pulse compression system is characterized by narrowband filtering of\nthe noise to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.

W.dRYAN\t\n\nFigure 4. Pulse decompression/compression diagram\n\nThe transmitted pulse is once again swept in frequency during transmission.\nHowever, the linearity or matched filter is not required. A replica of this swept\nfrequency is used as the heterodyning oscillator in the receiver. This receiver\nsweep is offset slightly in time from the received signal resulting in a C. W. tone\nduring the pulse. This C. W. tone may now be passed through a narrowband filter\nand thus the noise reduced increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n4.0 SUMMARY\nThe actual design parameters of a satellite altimeter are dictated by the\norbital elements, the type of surface to be mapped, the resolution desired, and\nthe physical constraints of size, weight, and power placed upon the design by the\n28\n\nPig WNW\n\nt\'a\n\nspacecraft. The radar altimeter design properties are summarized in Table I.\nEach of these properties may have different scientific applications.

At a pulse repetition rate of one thousand pps\nthis means 50 K bits per second of data.\n\n5.0 PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES\nRadar altimeters have been flown on several space programs, however their\nprime determination was limited to altitude and rate of ascent or descent. The\n"Surveyor" spacecraft emp crs od a CW altimeter system using two orthogonal\nantenna arrays to supply zit only de-4cent rate but also a velocity over the\nsurface component.\n\nThe Saturn launch vehicle electronics also includes an sltime er. Tnis is\nlimited to a height determination alone. This system is a pulsed radar ranging \t\n\n-\n\nunit with a 15 meter accuracy. The antenna for this altimeter is a slotted array\nmounted in the side of the vehicle. The maximum design range of 300 nm of\nunambiguous altitude has been achieved on all Saturn fligh, %\n\nThe Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) of the Manned Space Flight Program\nvises a landing radar similar to the Surveyor radar in that altitude and velocity\nare determined by CVs\' system. Tae descent and horizontal velocities are determined using three separate r.f.:-)eams radiating at a slight angle to the spacecraft axis. The altitude is deterw fined using an FM /CVO\' system with its own\naxial r .f. beam. This system is designed to operate from an altitude of 50,000 ft. to\n\n30\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2. ^ _ ;=^e+^4s. :. .fit a _ -\t\n\n_ ysa\t\n\n_.\t\n\n....\t\n\n_ _,\t\n\nf\t\n\n_\t\n\n_\n\ntouchdown.
