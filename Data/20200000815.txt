Wallett, Denise S. Ponchak, and Charles E. Niederhaus\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nGlenn Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\n\nSummary\n\nThese times need to be accurate to within \xc2\xb10.1 percent since\nthis affects the simulation fidelity, especially at higher altitudes.\nThe line-of-sight communication connection between the\nuser-mission satellite and any of the GEO satellites occurs when\nthe mission satellite is in the FOV of the closest GEO satellite.\nThe 1-year simulation time starts on July 1, 2000, at 16:00 UTC\nand ends on July 1, 2001, at 16:00 UTC. The GEO satellites\nare grouped together in a constellation. On each of those\nsatellites, a sensor is attached, nadir-facing the Earth, with all\nsensors simultaneously having conical FOV with half angles of\n\xc2\xb17\xc2\xb0 through \xc2\xb115\xc2\xb0, \xc2\xb120\xc2\xb0, \xc2\xb125\xc2\xb0, and \xc2\xb130\xc2\xb0 at a time for each\nsimulation. These sensors are then \xe2\x80\x9cchained\xe2\x80\x9d together,\noperating as one unit.\nFigure 1 illustrates three GEO satellites each at 35,788.1-km\naltitude with a generic LEO relay satellite model at 10,000-km\naltitude and 0\xc2\xb0 inclination. The altitude of LEO circular orbits\nvary from 100 to 10,000 km in increments of 100 km with four\ndifferent inclinations of 0\xc2\xb0, 28.5\xc2\xb0, 51.6\xc2\xb0, and 98\xc2\xb0. For all 12\nGEO FOV half angles, simulations are performed using the\nAnalytical Graphics, Inc., STK\xc2\xae Analyzer (Ref. 10). The ISS\nand seven HEO models orbit simulations are performed\nindividually, using their characteristic orbital parameters, for\neach of the 12 GEO FOV half angles.\nFor the 1-year simulations, the LEO to GEO satellite model\ntotal-access percent durations are found as a function of the\nLEO inclination angle, GEO FOV, and the LEO altitude. All\ncombinations of each of the 4 values of LEO inclination, 12\nvalues of GEO FOV, and 100 values of LEO altitude are\nsimulated. Since the LEO is circular, the LEO semimajor axis\nis simply the radius of the circular LEO. This is equal to the\naverage radius of the Earth, given as approximately 6,378.1 km,\nplus the LEO altitude (Ref. 11). Using results from the STK\xc2\xae\nAnalyzer\xe2\x80\x99s chain individual strand access, we find the start,\nstop, and duration times for each continuous connection in the\nperiod. Figure 2 to Figure 5 show both the yearly percentage\naccess and its relativity to a 10\xc2\xb0 GEO FOV as a function of the\nLEO altitude for LEO inclination at 0\xc2\xb0, 28.5\xc2\xb0, 51.6\xc2\xb0, and 98\xc2\xb0.\nThe discontinuity in the first derivative of the curves for a 0\xc2\xb0\ninclination LEO satellite in Figure 2 can be explained using\nFigure 6. The four LEO in Figure 6 are where the discontinuities\noccur. In Figure 6, it can be seen that 100 percent access occurs\nup to Orbit 1. From Orbit 1 to Orbit 2, the access decreases.\n\nThis report displays field-of-view studies through computer\nsimulation using the Analytical Graphics, Inc., Systems Tool\nKit\xc2\xae (STK\xc2\xae). This task analyzes the potential performance for\na variety of circular low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and some\nrelative to various user-mission orbits communicating with\ngeosynchronous-Earth-orbit (GEO) satellites. We further\ninvestigate relative data volumes taking into account the\nvarying satellite distances with an omnidirectional user\nantenna.\n\nIntroduction\nComputer simulations of field-of-view (FOV) studies using\nthe Analytical Graphics, Inc., Systems Tool Kit\xc2\xae (STK\xc2\xae) (Ref.\n1) were performed. These simulations assumed a threegeosynchronous-Earth-orbiting (GEO) satellite system with the\nsatellites located at 50\xc2\xb0 W, 170\xc2\xb0 W, and 70\xc2\xb0 E longitudes.\nPreliminarily, we also assume that the user-mission low-Earthorbit (LEO) satellite has an omnidirectional coverage antenna\nand is in a circular orbit. The GEO satellite antennas and LEO\nuser-mission antenna gain-to-noise-temperature (G/T) and\nequivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) are assumed constant\nover different look angles.\nThe International Space Station (ISS) (Ref. 2), a LEO model,\nand seven highly elliptical orbit (HEO) mission satellite models\nare each simulated in separate scenarios communicating to the\nGEO satellite models. These seven HEO satellite models are\nbased on the orbits of the Van Allen Probes A and B\n(Ref. 3), THEMIS (Ref. 4), XMM-Newton (Ref. 5), Geotail\n(Ref. 6), INTEGRAL (Ref. 7), IBEX (Ref. 8), and Chandra\nXRO (Ref. 9).\n\nGeometric Field-of-View Access Studies\nSimulations of a three-GEO satellite system connecting by\nline of sight to a user relay satellite are performed. Access times\nare a function of the user-mission satellite orbit inclination and\naltitude for a common GEO FOV. The access time is the total\ntime in the entire simulation period when the user-mission\nsatellite is in the FOV of one or more of the GEO satellites.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942020-216589\n\n1\n\nFrom Orbit 2 to Orbit 3, the access begins to increase until it\ndecreases again from Orbit 3 to Orbit 4. Past Orbit 4, the access\nshould continue to decrease although this is not shown.\nA Microsoft Excel spreadsheet is used to calculate those\naltitudes for the critical 0\xc2\xb0 inclination LEO satellite orbits using\nstandard geometrical considerations. The total access duration\ntimes for the LEO simulations decrease gradually as the LEO\ninclination angle increases. This decrease occurs at a higher rate\nfor higher inclination angles. These times also decrease steadily\nas the LEO altitude increases, except for a limited region of\nLEO altitudes where the GEO FOV extends beyond the Earth.\nIn general, the total access duration time increases as the GEO\nFOV values increase, however, due to lack of pole coverage, an\nanomaly occurs at 98\xc2\xb0 LEO inclination for 9\xc2\xb0 GEO FOV at low\naltitude. One characteristic of the LEO satellite simulations is\nthat the access times for each LEO inclination approach similar\ncorresponding maximum values. This characteristic occurs at\nGEO FOV values greater than an observed value typically\nfalling somewhere between 9\xc2\xb0 and 10\xc2\xb0. However, under the\nobserved value, the lower the GEO FOV value becomes, the\nmore disparate the access times for the four LEO inclinations\nbecome with higher values corresponding to the lower LEO\ninclinations. As exhibited in Figure 7, the maximum altitude for\ncomplete 100 percent access between the LEO satellite and any\nGEO satellite is nearly linear with most angles of the GEO FOV\nhaving the same slope regardless of the LEO inclination.\nThe inclinations of the other orbit models are ISS (51.6\xc2\xb0),\nVan Allen Probes A and B (10.2\xc2\xb0), THEMIS (16.0\xc2\xb0), XMMNewton (67.1338\xc2\xb0), Geotail (10.51\xc2\xb0), INTEGRAL (54.0\xc2\xb0),\nIBEX (45.8582\xc2\xb0), and Chandra XRO (76.7156\xc2\xb0). The yearly\npercentage access versus GEO FOV for them is summarized in\nFigure 8.\n\nThe LEO transmitter power was set to 10 dBW, the transmitter\nand receiver gains were set to 0 dB, and the transmission\nfrequency was set to 26 GHz in the Ka band, while the data rate\nwas arbitrarily set to a constant 1 bit/s for simulation purposes.\nQuadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) was used and possible\ndata rates were calculated based on the generated link budget.\nThe CommSystem link information detailed report lists\nthe bit energy to noise power density (Eb/No) in dB for\napproximately each minute during connection periods. Since\n2.9 dB at 10\xe2\x80\x935 bit error rate (BER) is the approximate minimum\nEb/No needed for the data connection to a Tracking and Data\nRelay Satellite (TDRS), we assumed this value for simulation\npurposes (Ref. 11). Using this value, we applied the excess\nEb/No above 2.9 dB toward the 0 dBHz (1 bit/s) data rate. The\nvalue of the data rate was then increased into the kbps range.\nThis shows the maximum data rates, which are available\nthroughout the orbit and simulation.\nThroughout the varying distances in the orbit, given a\nminimum Eb/No connection value, the data volume is calculated\nby multiplying each time interval in the CommSystem link\ninformation detailed report by the corresponding calculated data\nrate. The total data rate for the 1-year simulation period was then\nfound by the summation of the individual intervals.\nThe 1-year data volumes (Gb) for 0\xc2\xb0, 28.5\xc2\xb0, 51.6\xc2\xb0, and 98\xc2\xb0\ninclination LEO satellites at 100 to 1,000 km in steps of 100 km\naltitude are determined as a function of GEO FOV and presented\nin Figure 9 to Figure 12. The data volumes (Gb) for the ISS LEO\nand the seven various HEO satellite orbit models, together, are\nsummarized in Figure 13. The five lowest throughput HEO\nsatellite orbit models data are shown more clearly in Figure 14.\n\nData Volume Studies\n\nThis study serves as a guide to estimate the access and\nmaximum data transfer possible to a geosynchronous-Earth-orbit\n(GEO) constellation of three satellites from a relay satellite\nhaving a similar orbit to those models previously discussed.\nSeveral mission scenarios with varying inclinations and altitudes\nwere analyzed to assist with architecture planning. These\nanalyses are limited to line of sight only and ignore antenna\npatterns. Data is assumed to be transferred when access is\navailable. Results indicate that higher altitude reduces visibility\nand therefore data volume, but larger field of view (FOV) gives\nlonger access times. Only generic low-Earth-orbit (LEO)\nsatellites and the orbits of specific missions were modeled. Their\norbits provided representative mission scenarios for the analysis.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nData volumes can be inferred by simulating a transmitter on\nthe user-mission satellite, which connects and sends data to\nonly the closest of the GEO satellite receivers by using a special\nfeature, CommSystem, available in the Analytical Graphics,\nInc,. STK\xc2\xae SatPro version. This feature was specifically\ndesigned to model dynamically configured communications\nlinks between constellations of transmitters and receivers in\norder to constrain the access to only the nearest of receivers.\nSince the user-mission satellite would occasionally access more\nthan one GEO satellite simultaneously, we forced it to link to\nonly one satellite at a time by placing it in its own constellation.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942020-216589\n\n2\n\nReferences\n1.
