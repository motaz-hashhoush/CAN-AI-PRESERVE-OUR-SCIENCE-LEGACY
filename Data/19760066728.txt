M .\nJanuary 30, 1966\nINITIAL TOS LAUNCHING\nSCHEDULED FEBRUARY 2\nThe first satellite in the TIROS Operational Satellite (TOS) system will be\nlaunched no earlier than February 2, the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) of the Department of Commerce announced today.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration will launch the weatherobserving spacecraft for ESSA from Cape Kennedy.\nIf the launch is successful, the satellite will be named ESSA I (Environmental\nSurvey Satellite).\nInaugurated by this launch, the TOS system will be the world\'s first operational weather satellite system and will provide forecasters with daily pictures of the\ncloud cover over the entire earth, except for those areas in polar darkness.\nThe system is a result of NASA\'s meteorological satellite research and development program and the second operational satellite system developed by NASA.\nThe Communication Satellite Corporation\'s "Early Bird" communications satellite,\nlaunched April 6, 1965, by NASA was a direct result of NASA\'s R&D work with\nSyncom satellites.\n- more -\n\nN E WS\n\nNATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20546\n\np.-\n\nWO 2-4155\nWO 3-6925\n\n- 2TOS is financed by ESSA and is managed and operated by ESSA\'s National\nEnvironmental Satellite Center. Information gathered by satellites in the TOS system will be used by the Weather Bureau (an agency of ESSA) to improve daily weather\nanalyses and forecasts and also will be transmitted throughout the world to aid\nweathermen in other nations.\nSince April 1, 1960, ten TIROS (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) satellites and one Nimbus spacecraft have been launched successfully by NASA. These\nwere NASA research and development satellites, except for TIROS X which was bought\nby ESSA and launched during the 1965 hurricane season to keep watch on ocean areas.\nThe ESSA spacecraft is a cartwheel satellite of the TIROS type. As it rolls along\nin orbit like a wheel, each of the two cameras on its rim will point directly toward\nthe earth once during every revolution. In its nearly polar, sun-synchronous orbit,\nthe satellite will view weather all over the world once every day, photographing a\ngiven area at the same local time each day.\nThe satellite\'s two camera systems store photographs on magnetic tape for transmission to the Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations, which are located near\nFairbanks, Alaska, and at NASA\'s Wallops Station, Virginia.\nThe TOS system will soon be expanded with the launching of a satellite carrying two Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) camera systems.\n\nAPT camera systems\n\nphotograph the clouds over areas beneath the satellite and immediately transmit the\npictures automatically to relatively simple receiving stations on the ground.\nThe APT camera system was tested on TIROS VIII and Nimbus I and proved to be\nvaluable because of its real-time feature in improving local weather forecasts, in\nbriefing air crews on weather over oceans and intercontinental flying routes, and in\nwarning ships of storms and rough seas.\nWhen the TOS system is in full swing, two satellites\xe2\x80\x94one with APT cameras\nand one with picture storage capability\xe2\x80\x94will be in orbit at all times to provide\nboth local and worldwide cloud cover pictures at least once a day.\n(END OF PRESS RELEASE; BACKGROUND DATA FOLLOWS)\n\n- 3-\n\nTECHNICAL DATA SUMMARY\nSpacecraft\n\nCylindrical, 18-sided polygon,\n22 inches high and 42 inches in\ndiameter, weighing 305 pounds.\n\nMission Objectives\n\nInitiate TIROS Operational Satellite System.\nObtain complete daily coverage of\nweather systems over the earth.\n\nLaunch Information:\nVehicle\n\nThree-stage Delta developing\n170,000 pounds of thrust at liftoff.\n\nLaunch Pad\n\nComplex 17, Pad A, at the Eastern\nTest Range, Cape Kennedy, Fla.\n\nDate\n\nNo earlier than February 2, 1966.\n\nOrbital Elements:\nInclination\n\nNear polar and sun synchronous,\n81 degrees retrograde to the Equator.\n\nPeriod\n\n100 minutes.\n\nOrbit\n\nCircular, 460 statute miles high.\n\nVelocity\n\nApproximately 17,000 miles per hour.\n\nCameras\n\nTwo j-inch vidicons which take\nmore than 400 pictures daily with\na resolution of about two miles at\npicture center.\n\nPower System\n\n9,100 solar cells (N on P) which\nconvert sun energy to electrical\nenergy to keep 63 nickel-cadmium\nbatteries charged.\n\nTracking\n\nFifteen stations of the worldwide\nSpace Tracking and Data Acquisition Network (STADAN) operated by\nthe Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nCommand and Data Acquisition Stations . . . .\n\nWallops Station, Va.\nGilmore Creek, Alaska.\n\n- 4-\n\nProgram Management\n\nNational Environmental\nSatellite Center,\nEnvironmental Science\nServices Administration,\nDepartment of Commerce.\n\nSpacecraft & Launch Vehicle Management\n\nNASA Office of Space Science\nand Applications,\nGoddard Space Flight Center.\n\nLaunch Operations\n\nKennedy Space Center\n\nMajor Contractors:\nDelta Vehicle\n\nDouglas Aircraft Company\n\nTIROS Spacecraft\n\nRadio Corp. of America\n\n- 5-\n\nTHE SPACECRAFT\nThe first ESSA satellite, like its TIROS predecessors, is a hatbox-shaped structure. The spacecraft is an 18-sided polygon which weighs 305 pounds, stands 22\ninches high, and measures 42 inches in diameter.\n9,100 solar cells are mounted on the top and sides of the satellite structure. Protruding from the top of the spacecraft is an 18-inch receiving antenna which receives\ncommands from the data acquisition stations. Four 22-inch transmitting whip antennas, which extend from the bottom or baseplate of the satellite, transmit television pictures, as well as telemetry information on the spacecraft temperature,\npressure, battery charge levels, spin -rate, and other "housekeeping" data.\nTELEVISION CAMERAS\nThe camera subsystems are two identical |-inch vidicon cameras, similar to those\ncarried on previous TIROS missions. They have a resolution of about two miles at\npicture center. Each camera has a wide-angle (104-degree) lens.\nThe cameras, mounted 180 degrees apart on the side of the spacecraft so they can\nview the earth once every revolution (every six seconds), are canted 2 6 . 5 degrees\nto each side of the plane of the satellite\'s rotation. An onboard camera-triggering\nsystem programs the cameras to take pictures only when looking at the earth.\nThe camera system can send pictures directly to a command and data acquisition\nstation or store the photos on its associated tape recorder for readout when the\nsatellite passes within a 1,500-mile radius of a ground station.\nDATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS\nPicture Reception\nCloud pictures, as well as spacecraft performance data, will be received at two\nground stations called Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations. These\nstations are at Wallops Island, Virginia, and Gilmore Creek (near Fairbanks),Alaska.\nTransmission time for a full orbit of pictures is about three minutes and begins when\nthe satellite receives a radio command from the ground.\nTelevision pictures are transmitted from the spacecraft as signals which are recorded on magnetic tape at the command and data acquisition stations. These signals are immediately transmitted to the National Environmental Satellite Center,\nnear Washington, D. C., where they are "played back" on special kinescopes and\nphotographed by 35-mm. cameras.\nEach of the spacecraft\'s two tape recorders has sufficient tape to store 48 frames\nfor later transmission. The tapes are erased immediately after playback and again\njust before recording.\n\n- 6-\n\nData Analysis\nThe picture signals received at the command and data acquisition stations are\nretransmitted immediately to the Data Processing and Analysis Facility of ESSA\'s\nNational Environmental Satellite Center.\nThe signals are projected on special TV screens and photographed by 35-mm. cameras,\nTo locate the pictures geographically, latitude and longitude grids prepared by computer are electronically combined with the picture signals.\nMeteorologists use the gridded photographs to produce cloud-cover maps, called\nnephanalyses. The Weather Bureau\'s National Meteorological Center then integrates the cloud maps with worldwide weather data obtained by conventional means\nfor use in daily weather analysis and forecasting. The satellite analyses also are\nrelayed to field stations in the United States and to other countries throughout the\nworld.\nTHE ORBIT\nThe combination of the cartwheel configuration and the near-polar, sun-synchronous\norbit permits complete coverage of the earth\'s weather.\nIn a sun-synchronous orbit, the precession (eastward drift) of the satellite is about\none degree daily, at the same rate and direction as the earth moves around the sun,\nso the satellite photographs each area of the earth at the same local sun time every\nday.\nTHE FLIGHT PLAN\n\nThe launch vehicle for this mission is the NASA-develope.d three-stage Delta. If successful, it will be the 33rd Delta-launched spacecraft orbited out of 36 attempts.\nThis will be the third polar orbit attempt-from Cape Kennedy by a Delta. The two previous successful TIROS launches were on January 22 and July 1, 1965.\nFor this mission, NASA will use the DSV-3C Delta.\nThe launch window for Delta 36 is about 30 minutes with lift-off from Complex 17,\nPad-A, scheduled for 2:53 A . M . EST.\nIt must perform three precise "dogleg" maneuvers before it reaches its orbital injection point some 2000 miles southwest of Cape Kennedy over the Pacific Ocean.\nAll commands during the dogleg maneuvers will be initiated from the airborne autopilot system.\nDuring the first-stage burning time, from T plus 90 to T plus 111 seconds, commands\nfrom the autopilot will turn the vehicle to the right, changing the trajectory.\nWhen,the second \'stage burns out and the seven-minute coast period begins, Delta\nwill perform its final maneuver. During this period, the vehicle will be pitched\n\n- 7-\n\ndown 47 degrees and the nose will be turned left eight degrees so the vehicle is\nin the proper attitude and trajectory for third-stage ignition and injection into orbit.\nThe ESSA spacecraft is scheduled to be injected into a sun-synchronous orbit about\n300 miles west of Quito, Ecuador (84 degrees west longitude and 0 degrees latitude).\nDuring the first orbit, the satellite will operate in much the same manner as earlier\n(non-cartwheel) TIROS spacecraft. It will be spin stabilized at about 10 revolutions\nper minute with the spin axis in the plane of the orbit.\nAs the satellite starts its second orbit, a gradual orientation maneuver, controlled\nfrom the ground, will begin to turn the satellite on its side into the cartwheel position. Qn command from the ground, electrical currents will pass through a magnetic\nattitude coil inside the spacecraft which turns the satellite at a rate of about 10 degrees per orbit.\nWhen the satellite is about halfway on its side (spin axis 45 degrees out of the plane\nof the orbit), the current will be reduced to about half, so that the spacecraft will\nturn five degrees per orbit.\nAbout 14 to 18 orbits, about 24 hours after launch, the satellite should be on its\nside, in the cartwheel attitude. After about 36 hours, project engineers will turn on\nthe two television cameras to photograph the earth.\nNormal orbital elements are an apogee and perigee of 460 miles, a period of 100 minutes, and an inclination to the Equator of 81,7 degrees (retrograde).\nSTABILIZATION AND CONTROL" SUBSYSTEMS\n\nTwo dynamic control (DYCON) units in TOS control the satellite\'s spin rate, camera\ntiming, and the magnetic attitude coil currents which steer the satellite to the cartwheel attitude and maintain it in that position.\nShortly before the burned-out second stage of Delta separates from the third stage,\nthe entire vehicle spins up to approximately 125 r . p . m . to\'maintain control of the\nthird stage.\nTo reduce the satellite\'s spin rate to the desired 10 r . p . m . , a timer triggers two\nweights attached to cables wrapped around the outside of the satellite. As the\nweights uncoil, they reduce the spin to the proper rate and then automatically drop\naway from the spacecraft.\nThe interaction between the earth\'s magnetic field and magnetic material in the spacecraft causes a drag effect .which reduces the spin rate, making the satellite unstable.\nTo prevent this, the satellite has two types of spin control systems\xe2\x80\x94a magnetic coil\ninside the spacecraft and small, solid-propellant rockets for backup.\nThe magnetic coil, made of aluminum, is 30 inches long and is tightly wrapped inside a rectangular spool in the spacecraft. The satellite\'s spin rate can be kept\nnearly constant by sending small charges of electric current through the coil.\n\n- 8-\n\nAs a backup method of maintaining the spin rate, five pairs of small solid-propellant\nrockets mounted on the rim. of the spacecraft can be fired upon command from a\nground station. Each rocket motor develops an impulse of approximately 1.4 pounds\nper second. When fired in pairs, these rockets can increase the spin rate by about\nthree r . p . m .\nAttitude Sensors\nTwo infrared horizon sensors arranged in a V configuration determine the satellite\'s\nattitude in space. The plane of the V contains the spin axis, and the bisector of\nthe angle between the optical axes is normal to the spin vector.\nIf the spin axis of the satellite is normal to an earth radius, the outputs of the sensors are identical. If a yaw error exists at one point in orbit, there will be an equal\nroll error 90 degrees later in orbit because of the inertial rigidity of the spin vector.\nRoll error is detectable as an inequality in the pulse durations of the two sensors.\nBecause accuracy is determined by the resolution and reliability of each of the data\npoints, at least 10 minutes of roll error data will be required in a given pass. The\nroll error data will be used by the satellite control center to correct attitude and spin\nrate errors.\nPower Supply\nThe power supply delivers up to 2.2 amperes and consists of solar cells, storage\nbatteries, voltage regulators, and protective circuits.\nSolar energy is converted to electricity by 9,100 N on P solar cells, 1 cm. by 2 cm.,\nattached to the top and sides of the spacecraft cover assembly. The cells are arranged in shingles of five series-connected cells. Each cell has a bonded coat of\nfused silica to improve thermal emissivity, a vacuum-deposited antireflective coating, and a 6-mm. -shield to prevent radiation damage.\nDuring the daylight orbits, power from the solar array is fed directly to spacecraft\nsubsystems. Current not used immediately charges 63 nickel-cadmium storage batteries which have a capacity of 295 watt-hours. The batteries, connected in three,\nparallel strings of 21 cells, supply spacecraft power during the nighttime.\nDiodes in the .solar cells prevent the storage batteries from discharging into the\nsolar cells during orbital night.\nCamera Triggering Subsystem.\nThe camera triggering system is designed to assure that pictures are taken only when\nthe cameras are looking vertically at earth.\nEach camera has two independent triggering systems\xe2\x80\x94a self-computing trigger system and a spin-synchronized trigger system. A command from the ground selects the\nsystem to be used.\nThe self-computing trigger system is controlled by an onboard computer which predicts horizon crossings in advance to ready the cameras and tape recorders for an\nupcoming picture sequence.\n\n- 9-\n\nThe spin-synchronized trigger system can operate only when the spacecraft is\nspinning precisely at 9.\'. 8 r . p . m . Horizon scanners determine the satellite\'s spin\nrate so the triggering system will turn on the cameras and tape recorders when\nthe earth is directly below.\nDELTA LAUNCH VEHICLE\n\nDelta is a launch vehicle program of NASA\'s Office of Space Science and Applications,\nProject management is the responsibility of the Goddard Space Flight Center.
