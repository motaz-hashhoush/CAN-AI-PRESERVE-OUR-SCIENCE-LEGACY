Similar questions of robustness in the context of neural networks are analyzed in [5].\n3. It is interesting\nto know to what extent the robustness functions that correspond to rain and max are\nsmaller than those of the other binary operations:\nare they smaller in a few points only, or essentially smaller\nfor all 6? The answer is given by the following Theorems:\nTheorem\n3. Suppose that f(a, b) is an &-operation,\nand f(a, b) is different from min. Then there ezists a\npositive real number A > 0 and positive real number C < 1 such that for all 6 < A, train(6)\n<: Crl(6\n).\nTheorem\na positive\n\n4.

From Theorem\n5 we can conclude that the operations\nab and a + b - ab are equally robust, and that\nf(a. b) = min(a + b, 1) is more robust than both of them.\n4. The fact that ab and a + b - ab are equally robust stems from the fact that in general dual operations\nhave the same modulus of continuity, where g(a, b) is dual to an f(a, b) if g(a, b) = 1 - f(1 - a, 1 - b).\nProposition\n\n2.

In the present paper, we will compare two defuzzification rules that are most wide spread in\nfuzzy control theory: centroid rule and center-of-maximum\nrule (see description below). Both defuzzification\nrules are applicable in case a membership function p(z) has a compact support (i.e., is equal to 0 outside\nsome interval), and is not everywhere equal to 0. Let us recall the definitions.\nDefinition\n8. Let us fix an interval [a, hi, and consider only membership functions that are equal to 0 outside\nthis interval, and that are not everywhere equal to 0. The set of all such membership functions will be denoted\nby M. A mapping D from M to [a, b] is called a defuzzification.\nBy a centroid defuzzification we mean a\nmapping that transforms V(z)into\na number Dc(/J) = (f u(z)dz)/(f\nv(z)dz). By a center.of.mazimum\ndefuzzification\nwe mean a mapping that transforms p(z) from M into a number DCOM (V) = 1/2(m_ + rn+),\nwhere m_ = inf{z : v(z) = maxy(u(y))}, and m+ = sup{z : _(z) = maxy(v(u))}.\nMotivation\nof the following definition.\nIn this case, it turns out that it is not necessary to compare the\nnumerical estimates of robustness,\nbecause it turns out that one of these procedures\nis simply robust, and\nanother is not in the following sense. It is reasonable\nto say that a procedure is robust if small deviation of\np(z) lead to small deviations in the result. Here "small deviations" mean that IV(z) - V\'(Z)[ < 6 for some\nsmall number 6, or, in other words, that p(p,p I) < 5, where we denoted p(p,p\') = sup= IV(x) - p\'(z)l.\nSo,\nin mathematical\nterms, robustness just means that a mapping D must be continuous in this metric p. Let\nus first remind the definition of continuity:\nDefinition\n9. A mapping D from M to [a, b] is called continuous at the point P with respect to metric p,\nif for every c there exists a 6 such that if P(V, P\') < 6, then ID(v) - D(a\')l < c. If D is continuous in all the\npoints of M, it is called a continuous mapping.\nDefinition\n10. We say that a defuzzification\np) into the interval [a, b].\nTheorem\n\n8.\n\nROBUST\n\nCentroid\n\ndefuzzification\n\nis robust, if it is a continuous mapping\n\nis robust,\n\nwhile center-of.mass\n\ndefuzzification\n\nfrom DM\n\n(with metric\n\nis not.\n\nNORMALIZATION\n\nMotivation.\nIn some cases, before making a decision an auxiliary operation is performed with a membership\nfunction Vc(u) that is called a normalization.\nThe reason for this operation is that for many notion from\nnatural language, there is a value about which all the experts (or at least the vast majority of them) agree\nthat this value satisfies the desired property:\nfor example, for "negligible" it is 0, for "big" it is 1000 (or\n106 if 1000 is not enough). So, for the corresponding\nmembership functions p(z), there exists a value z0 for\nwhich tt(z0) = 1, hence sup_ V(z) = 1.\nHowever, after appiying the &-, V- and -,-operations,\nwe sometimes obtain a membership\nfunction V(z), for\nwhich sups: p(z) < 1, and which is thus difficult to interpret.\nSo, before we apply a defuzzification\nprocedure\nto it, we first want to normalize this membership\nfunction, i.e., apply some transformation\nt : [0, v] -- [0, 1]\nand get a new function p\'(z) = t(V(Z)) whose biggest value is already equal to 1. Usually, the function\nt(z) = z/v is taken. The question is: which of the possible normalization procedures\nis the most robust?\nDefinition\n11. Assume that a number v < 1 is given. By a normalization\nf: [0, v] -- [0, 1] such that f(0) = 0 and f(v) = 1.\n\nwe mean an increasing\n\nfunction\n\nDefinition 12. Suppose that a normalization\nf(a) isgiven.We say that a 6-input uncertainty\nleadsto a\n< a-output error,\nifforevery a,a\',\nforwhich [a- a\'I< 6,we have If(a) f(a\')l a.

This results is not as discouraging as it may seem at first glance. The reason is as follows. As one\ncan see from the proof, this 5 can be big. From the purely mathematical\nviewpoint, this is quite reasonable.\nHowever, the entire purpose of analyzing robustness of fuzzy operations is to take into consideration\nthe\nuncertainty with which experts can estimate their own beliefs, and this uncertainty is usually small. So it\nmakes sense to compare b-robustness\nof different operations only for small 6. So we arrive at the following\ndefinition.\nDefinition\n13. We say that a function f(6) is asymptotically\nA > 0 such that for 6 < A, f(5) < g(6).\n\nsmaller\n\nthan a function g(6) if there exists a\n\nDefinition\n14.

Suppose that f(z) is a normalization,\nand f(z) is different from f0(z) = z/v.\nThen there\nexists a positive real number A > 0 and positive real number C < 1 such that for all 6 < A, r fo(df ) < Crl(6).\nROBUST\n\nCHOICE\n\nOF\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nFUNCTIONS\n\nMotivation.\nAll the above considerations are about the case when the experts can be uncertain,\nbut the\ninputs for the control decision (i.e., the values of z, k, etc) are considered to be precise. In real-life situations,\nespecially in the case of the future space missions, it is important\nto take into considerations\nthat the input\ndata can also be imprecise.\nIn this case, we want to choose membership\nfunctions in such a way that the\nchange in an input value z will lead to the smallest possible change in the value of p(z) (and thus in the\nresulting control). In other words, we want to guarantee\nthat the interval of possible values of p(z) is the\nleast possible.\nWe want to use thisidea to choosethe most robustextrapolationrocedureformembership functions.\np\nIn\notherwords,when we have a fuzzynotionforwhich we want to describe membership function, e describe\na\nw\nwhen thisnotionisabsolutely\ntrue,\nand when itis absolutely alse\nf\n(i.e.,\nwhen the membership function\nis\nequalto I and 0) and get all\nother values membership function extrapolation.\nof\nby\nIn fuzzy control, four types of natural-languages\nterms (fuzzy variables) variables are mainly used:\n1) Variables like "negligible",\nwhere one can name a value zo for which the corresponding property\nis\nabsolutely true (ta(z0) = 1), (for negligible it is z0 = 0), and the values z_ and x+ such that for z < z_\nand z > z+ the corresponding property is absolutely false (e.g., values with z < z_ or z > z+ are\nabsolutely not negligible).\n2) (similar case) Variables, for which we can name an interval [a_, a+], inside which the corresponding\nproperty is absolutely true, and a bigger interval [z_, z+], outside which this property is absolutely false\n(the first case can be considered as a particular\ncase of this one, when a_ = a+ = z0).\n3) Variable like "positive big", for which we can name values z_ < z+ such that for z < z_ the corresponding property is absolutely false, and for z > z+ this property is absolutely true.\n4) Variable like "negative big", for which we can name values z_ < z+ such that for z < z_ the corresponding property is absolutely true, and for z > z+ this property is absolutely false.\nIn the first and second cases, usually the intervals\nand, in the second case, z+ - a+ = a_ - z_.\n\nare symmetric,\n\ni.e., in the first case, x+ - z0 = z0 - z_,\n\nNow we are ready for the definitions.\nDefinition 15.

The set S of all real numbers a, for which a 6-input\nuncertainty\nleads to a\n< a-output\nerror, is bounded from below (by 0), and therefore, has an infinum (the greatest lower bound)\nr. r is the value of 6-robustness.\nIndeed, since r is the greatest lower bound of the set S, for every positive\ninteger k there exists a number rt _ S such that rk < r+ 1/k. According to the definition of S, from r_ E S\nwe conclude that if [a - a\'[ < 6 and [b - b\'l < 6, then If(a, b) - f(a\', b\')[ _< r_. Letting k -- oc, we conclude\nthat ]f(a, b) - f(a\', b\')] < limk r, = r. Q.E.D.\nProof\n\nof Theorem\n\n1.\n\n1\xc2\xb0. Let us first prove that, as in the case of t-norm,\nwe have f(a, b) < min(a, b) for any &-operation\nSince f(a, b) < a and f(a, b) = f(b, a) <_b, it follows that f(a, b) <_ rain(a, b).\n2 \xc2\xb0. Next, rmin(_ ) = _.\n\n158\n\nf.\n\nIndeed, for laa\'[ < 5, we have a _< a\'+ 6 and likewise b <_ b\'+ 6. Hence, min(a,b)\n< min(a\' +\n5, b\'+ 5) = min(a\', b\')+ 6, therefore, rain(a, b) _< min(a\', b\')+ 5. Likewise, min(a\', b\') < rain(a, b)+ 6, so\n-5 <_ rain(a, b) - min(a\', b\') < 6, and I min(a, b) - min(a\',b\')l\n<_ 6. Take a = b = 6, a\' = b\' = 0. Then\n] rain(a, b) - min(a\', b\')] - 6, and therefore, the output error is precisely 5. So, we cannot take a < 5, and so\nthe 6-robustness\nof min is really equal to 6.\n3\xc2\xb0. For every &-operation\nf(a, b): rl(6 ) > train(6) = 5.\nSuppose that for some 6 E (0, 1), r1(6 ) < 6. This means that if la - a\'l < 6 and Ib - b\'l < 5, then\nIf(a, b) - f(a\', b\')[ <_.rf(6) < 6. In particular,\nif we take a = b = I and a\' = b\' = I - 6, we conclude\nthat II(1, 1) - f(1 - 6, 1 - 6)[ < & But according to the definition of a &-operation,\n1(1, 1) = 1, therefore,\nthis inequality turns into l1 - 1(1 - 6, 1 - 6)l < 5. Hence, 1 - f(1 - 6, 1 - 6) _< [1 - I(1 - 5, 1 - 6)l < 6,\ntherefore, f(1 - 6, 1 - 6) > 1 - 5. But we have already proved in 1\xc2\xb0 that f(a, b) < rain(a, b), therefore,\nf(1 - 6, 1 - 6) < 1 - 6. These two inequalities\ncontradict to each other. Therefore, our assumption\nthat\nrl(6) < 6 is incorrect.\nHence, r.t(6) > 6.\n4\xc2\xb0. min(a, b) is the only &:-operation,\nfor which rl(6) = 6 for all 6.\nIndeed, suppose that f is different from min. Then for some a and b, f(a, b5 # min(a, b), hence f(a, b) <\nrain(a, b). Without loss of generality, assume a < b, resulting in f(a, b) < min(a, b) = a. For a\' = b\' = 1, we\nhave la - a\'] = 1 - a, Ib - b\'] = 1 - b _< 1 - a, but If(a, b) - f(a\', b\')l - 1 - f(a, b) > 1 - a. So, for 50 = 1 - a,\nrl(6o)\nProof\n\n> 6o.Q.E.D.\nof Theorem\n\n2 is similar.\n\nProof of Theorem\n3.

In particular,\nfor 5: = 62 = ... = 6, = 5o/n, we conclude that rt(5o) < nrj(5o/n).\nTherefore, r/(5o/n)\n> r/(5o)/n.\nIf we denote rl(50) by D, then this inequality takes the form r/(5o/n)\n>\nD/n.\nIn order to continue the proof, we need to use one more property of the modulus of continuity [13]: if 6 < 6\',\nthen rf(5) < r/(t_\').\nLet us now take any real number C between c = 6o/D and 1 (c < C < 1), and prove that there exists a\nA > 0 such that for all 6 < A, we have 5 < Cr](65 (or, equivalently, rl(6) > 5/C).\nWe already know how to estimate the values of rj(5) for 5 = Son, where n = 1, 2, 3,... So, to get the\nestimates for arbitrary\n6, we can use these known estimates.\nFor every 5 < 5o, we want to find an n such\nthat 50/(n + 1) < 6 < 5o/n. This inequality is equivalent to (n + I)/60 > I/5 > nSo, which, after multiplying\nboth sides by 50, turns out to be equivalent to the inequality n < 6o/5 _< n + 1. Therefore, we can take for n\nthe integer part [60/5J of the ratio 50/5. From monotonicity,\nwe can conclude that rl(6 ) > rf(5o/(n + 1)).\nWe have already proved that rl(So/(n + 15) > D/(n + 1). Therefore, rf(65 > D/(n + 15. We defined c as\n\nc = 6olD; so, D = 6o/c, so rS(6) >_5o/(c(n + 1)).\nWe want to get an inequality r](6) _> 6/C.\nWe will be able to deduce this inequality from the one that we\nhave just proved if 6o/(c(n + 1)) > 5/C. Since 6 < 6o/n, this inequality is valid if 6o/Cn < 6o/(c(n + I)).\nDividing both sides by 60 and then inverting both sides, we get an equivalent inequality Cn > c(n + 15,\nwhich, in its turn, is equivalent to (C - c)n >_.c and n > c/(C - c). Therefore, if n > c/(C - e), then for\n5 < 6o/n we get the desired inequality rl(5) >_ 6/e.\nThe inequality\nn > e/(C - e) is valid for all n starting from N = Ic/(C - c)J + 1. Therefore, the desired\ninequality r/(6) > 6/c is true for all 6 < A, where A = 5o/N. Q.E.D.\nProof of Theorem\nBefore proving\n\n4 is similar.\n\nTheorem\n\n5 let us prove Proposition\n\n2.\n\n159\n\nProof of Proposition\n2.\nI \xc2\xb0. Let us first prove that iff and g are dual, i.e., g(a, b) -" 1 -f(l\n-a, I -b), then for every 6, r_(6) > rl(6).\nIndeed, suppose that In - n\' I < 6 and Ib - b\' I < _f, and let us prove that ]9(a, b) - 9(a\', b\')] <_.rl(6 ). Since\n]a-a\']\n< 6 and [b-b\' I < 6, we have ]A-A\']\n= ]a-a\']\n< 6 and ]B-B\'I\n- ]b-b\']\n< 8, where we\ndenoted A = l-a,\nA _ = 1-a\',\nB = l-b,\nand B _ = 1-W.\nDue to the definition ofrf(6),\nwe can\nconclude that Lf(A, B) - I(A\', B\')] < r](8), nut g(a, b) = 1 - I(A, B) and g(a\', b\') = 1 - ](A\', B\'), therefore\n]g(a, b) - g(a\', b\')] = If(A, B) - f(A\', B\')[ < rj(6). So, for a = rl(6), if ]a - a\' I < 6 and Ib- b\'] _< 6, then\n]g(a, b) - g(a\',b\')l <_ a. Since rg(6) is defined as the smallest of all a with this property, we conclude that\n\nrg(8) < rs(8).\n2 \xc2\xb0. One can easily\nand r/(6)\n\ncheck that\n\n< rg(6), hence\n\nif g is dual to .f, then f is dual to g. Therefore,\n\nwe have both\n\nr0(6 ) < rl(6 )\n\nrg(6) - r9(6 ). Q.E.D.\n\nProof of Theorem\n5.\n1) We must prove, first, that if la - a\'] < 6 and ]b - b\'l _< 6, then lab - a_b\'] _< 26 there exist such a, b, a\', b\' for which la - a\'l _<6, Ib - b\'[ _<6, and lab - a\'b\' I - 28 - 62.\nThe second statement is easy to prove: take a = b = i, a\' = b\' = 1- 6, then lab- a\'bl[ =\nLet us now prove the first one.\nLet us denote la - a\'] by As, and ]b - bt[ by Ab. Then As < 8 and Ab < 8. Without\nwe can assume that a > a_. Then a r = a - As. With respect to b and b\', there are two\nand b < b\'. Let us consider both of them.\n\n62, and, second,\n\nthat\n\n1 - (I - 6): = 25- 6 :.\nlosing any generality\npossible cases: b >_ b\'\n\nIf b > b\', then b_ = b - Ab, and ab > aT, so the desired absolute value d = lab - atb_I can be computed\nas\nfollows: d = lab - a\'b\' I - ab - a\'b t = ab- (a - Aa)(b - Ab) = dab + bad -- AsAb. Since a < 1 and b < 1, we\nhave d < As + At -- AsAt. The right-hand side of this inequality can be expressed as 1 - (1 - A=)(1 - At).\nTherefore, it is a monotonely\nincreasing function of both As and At. So, its maximal value is attained when\nboth of these variables take their biggest possible values. Since/xs\n< 6 and At < 8, the maximal possible\nvalue is attained when As - At = 6, and is equal to 25 - 82. Therefore, d < Aa + At - AsAt <_ 26 - 6_.\nSo for this case the desired inequality is proved.\nLet us now consider the case when b < b\'. Then b = b\' - At, and d = lab- atb\'[ : la(b\' - At) - (a - As)b\'l =\n[aAb -btAs[.\nLet us consider two subcases: when the expression under the absolute value is positive or\nnegative, i.e., when dab > b_As and dab < b\'As. In the first subcase, d = nat - btAo, therefore, d <_b_As.\nSince As _< 6 and b\' _< 1, we get d _<6.\nIn the second subcase similarly d = WAs - nat < WAs < 6. So, in both cases d _<6.\nSo, to complete the proof, it is sufficient to show that 6 < 28 - 62 for all 6 from 0 to 1. Indeed, by dividing\nboth sides by 6 and moving all terms to the right-hand side, we conclude that this inequality is equivalent\nto 0 < 1 - 5, which is certainly true for 6 < 1.\n2) follows from 1) and Proposition\n\n2.\n\n3) Let us first consider the case, when 6 < 1/2. Then 26 < 1, and min(26, 1) = 2_. Let us prove that in this\ncase, if [a - a\'[ <_ 6 and Ib- b\'] _<6, then If(a,b) - f(a\',b\')l <_26.\nIndeed, ifla-a\'\nI _< 6 and [b-b\'[\n< 6, then [(a+b)-(at+b\')[\n-- [((a-a\')+(bb\')l _< 26. In\nparticular,\nthis means that a\' + b\' _< a + b + 28. Evidently, a\' + b\' < 1, therefore, a\' + bt _< 1 < 1 + 26.\nSo, a t + b\' is not bigger than the smallest of these two numbers:\na\' + b\' < min(a + b + 25, 1 + 25). But\nmin(a+b+25,\n1+28) = min(a+b, 1)+25 = .f(a, b)+26. So, a\'+b t <_f(a, b)+26. Since .f(a\', W) = min(a\'+b\',\nl)\nand therefore, f(a\', b\') < at + bt, we conclude that .f(a\', b\') <_ .f(a, b) + 26. In a similar manner we can prove\nthat f(a, b) < f(a\', b\') + 25. Combining these two inequalities,\nwe conclude that If(a, b) - f(a t, b\')l < 2&.\nSo, for 6 < 1/2, r](6) < 26.\nLet us now show that a = 28 is the smallest value, for which 6-input\nuncertainty\nleads to a < a-output\nerror, and thus, ri(6 ) = 26. Indeed, if we take a - b - 0, at = bt = 8, then In- all _< 6, Ib- b\'l _< 26, and\nIf(a, b) - f(a\', b_)l - [0 - 261 - 28, so the values a < 25 do not work in this case. So, for 6 < 1/2, we proved\nthat rl(6) : 26.\nNow let us consider the case when 6 _> 1/2. In this case, rain(26, 1) = 1. If we take a = b = O, a\' = bt = 6,\nthen f(a,b) = O, .f(a\',b\') = 1, la - a\'l _< $, Ib- b\'l _< 26, and If(a,b)/(at,b\')l\n= I0- II = 1. Therefore,\nnothing smaller than 1 can serve as a, hence r.\xc2\xa2(_) = 1. Q.E.D.\nProof of Theorem\n6. Let us first prove that for every negation operation, ry(6) > 6 for all 6. For a standard\nnegation operation\nfo(X) - 1 - z, f0(6) = 1 - 5. So, let us consider three possible cases: f(6) < 1 - 5,\nf(6) < 1-6,\nand f(6) > 1 -5.\n._\n\n160\n\nIn the first case, for a -- 0, a\' = 6, we have la-a\'\n\nI _< 6 and I/(a)-f(a\')]-\n\n[1-.f(6)l\n\n> 6. Therefore,\n\nr:(6) >_ If(a) - f(a\')l > 5, and rI(6 ) > 6.\nIn the second case, likewise r! (6) > 6.\nIn the third case, for a - 1 and a\' - f(6), we have la - a\' 1 < 6, but If(a) - f(a\')l "- ]0 - 61 - 6. Therefore,\nrl(6) > If(a)-f(a\')l\n> 6, and rl(6 ) > 6. So, in all three cases, we have r!(6) > 6 for all 6. For f(z) = 1 -z,\nr/(6) = 6. So, it is sufficient to prove that if a negation operation is not standard, i.e., f(x) \xc2\xa2 1- z for some\nz, then rl(6) > 6 for some 6. The case when f(z) < 1 - z was already considered above, and in this case,\nas we have already proved, r!(6) > 6 for 6 = z.\nSuppose now that f(z) > 1 - z. Then z > 1 - f(z).\nSo, for a = 1 and a\' - f(z), we have ]a - a\' I - 1 - f(z),\nand If(a) f(a\')l l0- zl "-z. Therefore,\nfory --1 - f(z),r/(y)_>If(a) f(a\')[ x > y, and rl(y)> y.\nQ.E.D.\nProof\n\nof Theorem\n\n7 follows easily from the same Lemma as the proof of Theorem\n\nProof\n\nof Theorem\n\n8. Let us first prove that Dc is a continuous mapping.\n\n3.\n\nFor that it is sufficient\n\nto prove\n\nthat the mappings # --* f p(z) dz and/a --* f z/J(=) dz are continuous, then Dc will be continuous as a ratio\nof two continuous mappings.\nIndeed, if I/J(z) - #\'(x)l < 6 for all z E [a, b], then -5 </_(x) -/(z)\n< 6, hence\n-6(b-a)\n<_ f(/_(x)-/(x))\ndx = f p(z) dx-f\np\'(z) dx < (b-a)6.\nTherefore, ]/p(z)\ndz -f/(z)\ndz] <_ (ba)6, and we can easily prove continuity with 6 "" el(b-a).\nLikewise, I fxlJ(Z) dx- f z/(z)\ndxl <_6(f_= Izl dz),\nso this expression is also continuous.\nLet us now prove that center-of-maximum\nis not continuous.\nIndeed, let us take a trapezoidal\nfunction/J(z)\nthat is equal to 0 for [z] > 2, to 1 for [zl _< 1, to 2- [z I for 1 < Izl < 2. Then m_ -- -1,m+\n= 1, hence\nDCOM(P) = 0. For every 6, we can define a new function p6(x) =/J(z)(1\n- (6/3)(1 - [xl) ). For this new\nfunction, the maximum (equal to 1) is attained in only one point x = 1, so DCOM(IJ6) = 1.\nSince we are considering only the values from -1 to 2, we have I1 - Ixl < 3, hence (6/3)(1 - Izl) _< 6, and\nImu(x) - #\'(z)l < 6. So, for c = 1/2, no matter how small 5 > 0 we take, we can always find a new function\n#6 such that p(p, p6) < 6, but DCOM(P6) - DCOM(P)\ni > 1/2. So DCOM is not continuous.\nQ.E.D.\nBefore proving\n\nProposition\n\n3 and Theorem\n\n9, let us first prove Theorem\n\nProof of Theorem\n10. For f0(z) = z/v, one can easily compute that\nis different from f0, so f(z) \xc2\xa2 fo(z) for some z. For this z, either .f(x)\ncase, for a = x and a\' = v, we have la - a\'] = v - z and If(a) - f(a\')l =\nr1(6 )>6Iv\nfor6=\n1-z.\nIn the second case, for a = 0 and a\' = z, we have la - a\' I = z and If(a)\n6 = z. In both cases, r!(6) > 8/v for some 6 > 0. Arguing like in Lemma,\nQ.E.D.\nProof\n\nof Theorem\n\n9 directly\n\nfollows from Theorem\n\n10. ,\nrio(6 ) = 6/v. We assumed that f\n< z/v, or f(x) > x/v. In the first\n1 - f(z) > 1 - x/v = (v - x)/v, so\n- f(a\')l > x/v, so r!(6)\nwe can find the desired\n\n> 6Iv for\nC and A.\n\n10.\n\nProof of Proposition\n3. If f(z) _ z/v, then the existence of the desired g(x) follows from Theorem 9: we\ncan take g(z) = z/u. So in order to prove this Proposition,\nit is sufficient to prove it for f(x) = z/v, i.e., it\nis sufficient to find a normalization g(z) such that r0(6 ) < 6/v for some 6 > 0.\nLet us define the following function F(x): F(x) = 100/3z for z < 0.01, F(z) = 1/3 for 0.01 < z < 0.495,\nF(z) = 1/3 + 100/3 * (x - 0.495) for 0.495 < z _< 0.505, F(z) = 2/3 for 0.505 < x <_ 0.99, and F(z) =\n2/3 + 100/3 \xe2\x80\xa2 (x - 0.99) for z > 0.99. This is a continuous function from [0,1] to [0,1]. Let us prove that\nfor g(x) - F(z)/v,\nrg(0.4) < 1/(3v) < 0.4/v. In other words, we want to prove that if la - a\' I < 0.4, then\nIg(a) g(a\')l i/(3v)< 0.4/v.\n<_\nWithout losing generality, we can assume that a < a\'; then a\' < 0.4 + a, and the desired inequality takes\nthe form g(a\') - g(a) < 1/(3v) < 0.4/v. Let us consider all possible locations of a.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If 0 < a _< 0.01, then a\' < 0.4-1- a < 0.4 + 0.01, and, therefore g(a\') <_ g(0.45) = (1/3)/v.\nHence,\ng(a\') - g(a) <_ g(a\') <_ (l13)lv.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If0.01 < a < 0.495, then g(a) = (1/3)/v, and a\' < 0.4+0.495 = 0.895, hence g(a\') <_g(0.895) = (2/3)/v.\nTherefore, g(a\') - g(a) < g(0.895) - g(a) = (1!3)Iv.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If 0.495 < a < 0.505, then g(a) > g(0.495) - (1/3)/v; here a\' <_ 0.505 + 0.4, hence g(a\') < g(0.905) =\n(2/3)/v).\nTherefore, g(a\') - g(a) < g(a\') - g(0.495) = (1/3)/v.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For the cases 0.505 < a < 0.99 and a >_0.99, the proofs are similar.\n\n161\n\n______.\n\n" So, in all the cases, Ig(a) - g(a\')l _< 1/(3v)\n\n< 0.4iv.\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nProof of Theorems\n11-14.\nFor the piecewise-linear functions, r_o(_) = k6, where k = 1/(z+ - z0) for\nfunctions of type 1, k = 1/(z+ - a+) for functions of type 2, and k = 1/(z+ - z_) for functions of types 3\nand 4.
