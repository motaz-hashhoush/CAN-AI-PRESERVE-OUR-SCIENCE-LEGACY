b'Partnership\nSuccesses\n\nN\n\nASA cultivates partnerships with private industry, academia, and other\ngovernment agencies to address the challenges that face our Nation.\nBy contributing time, facilities, and technical expertise, NASA brings\nthe benefits of space down to Earth where it enriches the lives of the American\npublic. The following pages are illustrative of the wealth of NASA success\nstories generated each year.\n\nPartnership Successes\n\nE\n\nach year, NASA research and development\nefforts contribute to a variety of successes.\nThrough partnerships with industry and academia, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s space-age technology improves all aspects\nof society. While not every technology transfer activity\nresults in commercialization, these partnerships offer\nfar-reaching benefits to U.S. citizens. The following\nexamples are just a few of the ways NASA is applying\nits technology and resources to improve the quality of\nlife on Earth.\n\nPartnership Successes\n\nTraffic Safety\nThis year, NASA and the National Highway Traffic\nSafety Administration (NHTSA) joined forces to, literally, take vehicles out for a spin. The NHTSA currently\nemploys a consumer rating system that uses an engineering formula to determine rollover resistance, but wanted\nto research new methods through NASA. Goddard Space\nFlight Center\xe2\x80\x99s High Capacity Centrifuge, used to test\nspacecraft before they are sent into space, was exactly\nwhat was needed to spin up some unique and original\nvehicle testing. Vehicles were positioned on the High\nCapacity Centrifuge\xe2\x80\x99s test platform, and spun until inertia and centrifugal force caused them to tip. A crash-test\ndummy was along for the ride in each vehicle to increase\nthe realism and accuracy of the test results. The High\nCapacity Centrifuge is a big machine, more than 150 feet\nin diameter, filling an entire circular building. With two\npowerful motors running at full tilt, the outer edge of the\ntest arm can reach speeds of more than 200 miles per\nhour, producing a force 30 times Earth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity. At rest,\nthe giant multi-ton arm sits on bearings so smooth just\ntwo or three people can push it around the room. NASA\nand the NHTSA expect this first-of-its-kind test will\n\n132\n\nenable them to gain valuable safety information about\nvehicles that move millions of Americans every day.\nEnvironmental Conservation\nIn an effort to preserve Earth\xe2\x80\x99s natural resources,\nGoddard is the first Federal facility to heat its buildings\nwith landfill gas. By harnessing methane gas from a\nnearby landfill and utilizing it to fire steam-producing\nboilers, Goddard is reducing emissions equivalent to taking 35,000 cars off the road per year, or planting 47,000\nacres of trees, according to Barry Green, the Center\xe2\x80\x99s\nEnergy Manager. On top of this, officials claim NASA\nwill save taxpayers more than $3.5 million over the next\ndecade in fuel costs. A few years ago, Dallas-based Toro\nEnergy, Inc., approached NASA, offering landfill gas as\na way to reduce fuel costs while helping to protect the\nenvironment. At no cost to the government, Toro Energy\nbuilt a purification plant and a 5-mile pipeline from the\nPrince George\xe2\x80\x99s County, Maryland-based Sandy Hill\nLandfill to Goddard, and modified two boilers at the\nCenter. The Sandy Hill Landfill has collected about 5.2\nmillion tons of trash and is expected to generate landfill\ngas for at least 30 years; NASA plans to use the gas for\n10 to 20 years. The Environmental Landfill Agency\xe2\x80\x99s\nLandfill Methane Outreach Program also provided\nexpertise to help complete this project.\nEarth Science\nScientists at Goddard, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n(JPL), and Ames Research Center are working in conjunction with several universities to develop an advanced\nearthquake modeling system. QuakeSim will give\nresearchers new insight into the physics of earthquakes\nusing state-of-the-art modeling, data manipulation, and\npattern recognition technologies when it is completed in\n2004. Consisting of several simulation tools, QuakeSim\nwill generate new quake models that\nresearchers anticipate will vastly improve\nfuture earthquake forecasting. According to\nQuakeSim principal investigator Dr. Andrea\nDonnellan, from JPL, the forecasts can be\nused by a variety of Federal and State agencies to develop decision support tools and\nhelp mitigate losses from large earthquakes.\nEmergency Management\nA new emergency communication system that aids first responders to natural or\n\nA sports utility vehicle harnessed to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s High\nCapacity Centrifuge is being prepared for a spin\nto simulate the kinds of forces that might cause\nthe vehicle to lose its stability and roll over.\n\nS P I N O F F\n\n2003\n\nGlenn Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s Dr. Rafat Ansari developed this prototype head-mounted eye disease monitoring system to detect eye\ncataracts and other eye diseases at the molecular level.\n\nPublic Safety\nFrom bombings and other homeland security threats,\nto child abductions and verifying the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d Saddam\nHussein, a video enhancement system developed at\nMarshall Space Flight Center is proving to be a valuable\nlaw enforcement tool. The technology known as VISAR\n(short for Video Image Stabilization and Registration)\ncan turn dark, jittery images captured by home video,\nsecurity systems, and video cameras mounted in police\n\nPartnership Successes\n\nman-made disasters is currently being field tested by the\nMaryland Emergency Management Agency. Developed\nby Aeptec Microsystems, Inc., through funding from\nGoddard\xe2\x80\x99s Small Business Innovation Research program and the U.S. Federal Emergency Management\nAgency (FEMA), Earth Alert will make it easier for\nFEMA, fire departments, and other organizations to\ntrack and communicate with emergency vehicles and\nstaff responding to disasters. Earth Alert combines global positioning satellite communications with personal\ndigital assistants and cellular phone technology to effectively integrate, analyze, and disseminate information\nfor emergency management. The technology employs\nseamless moveable maps and decision-making notification software while providing dispatchers with a realtime location of personnel from the field. It is envisioned\nthat Earth Alert-equipped pagers and fixed receivers\nlocated in schools, hospitals, businesses, and other facilities will be able to receive critical notifications of tornadoes, floods, chemical spills, and other disasters. NASA\nholds the rights to distribute Earth Alerts to first responders, while Aeptec is pursuing commercial applications.\n\ncars into clearer, stable images. NASA scientists\nDr. David Hathaway and Paul Meyer, who study violent\nexplosions on the Sun and examine hazardous weather\nconditions on Earth, created VISAR to aid in their space\nprogram research. VISAR has been licensed commercially by Intergraph Corp., of Huntsville, Alabama, and\nincorporated into Video Analyst,\xe2\x84\xa2 a workstation that\ncan stabilize and enhance video, brighten dark pictures\nand enlarge small sections of pictures to reveal clues\nabout crimes. In a recent application, ABC News asked\nIntergraph to analyze video clips that aired on Iraqi television on March 20, 2003, apparently showing Saddam\nHussein. Officials wanted to verify if Hussein survived\na U.S. air strike the previous day, or whether the video\nwas that of a body double. Using Video Analyst with\nVISAR, it took about 90 minutes to compare the ABC\nfootage to prior Iraqi television images of Hussein and\ndetermine\xe2\x80\x94with 99 percent certainty\xe2\x80\x94it was Hussein,\naccording to Intergraph officials. Columbia accident\ninvestigators also relied on VISAR to enhance video\nimages of the Space Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s external tank as it shed\ninsulation during liftoff.\nHealth\nIn the medical field, technology originally developed\nto study the behavior of fluids in microgravity is now\nbeing used to detect various eye problems earlier and\nmore accurately. Dr. Rafat Ansari, biofluid sensor systems scientist at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn Research Center, utilized\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cbuilt-for-space\xe2\x80\x9d fiber-optic probe, based on a technique called dynamic light scattering, to detect cataracts\nand other eye diseases at the molecular level.\nThe probe\xe2\x80\x99s value in early cataract detection has already\nbeen demonstrated in clinical trials at the National Eye\nInstitute of the National Institutes of Health. Detecting\ncataracts at an early stage can help doctors find nonsurgical cures for the disease. With the help of renowned\neye researchers around the world, Ansari is testing the\nprobe as a noninvasive diagnostic measurement device\nfor other eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular\ndegeneration. Ansari also uses the probe in tests to monitor diabetes and Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease.\nFrom public safety and health to environmental conservation, NASA outreach efforts are keeping Americans\nin step with a world constantly affected by change, while\nhelping to unravel the mysteries of the universe and\nworlds beyond. The intertwining of Earth and space\nsciences and the continuance of successful partnership\nrelationships with industry and academia will yield infinite benefits for many years to come.\nVideo Analyst\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of Intergraph Corp.\n\nS P I N O F F\n\n2003\n\n133\n\n'
