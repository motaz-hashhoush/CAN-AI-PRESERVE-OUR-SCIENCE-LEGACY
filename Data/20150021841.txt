b'Iodine Satellite\nThe Iodine Satellite (iSat) spacecraft will\nbe the first CubeSat to demonstrate\nhigh change in velocity from a primary\npropulsion system by using Hall thruster\ntechnology and iodine as a propellant.\nThe mission will demonstrate CubeSat\nmaneuverability, including plane change,\naltitude change and change in its closest\napproach to Earth to ensure atmospheric\nreentry in less than 90 days. The mission\nis planned for launch in fall 2017.\nHall thruster technology is a type of\nelectric propulsion. Electric propulsion\nuses electricity, typically from solar panels,\nto accelerate the propellant. Electric\npropulsion can accelerate propellant to\n10 times higher velocities than traditional\nchemical propulsion systems, which\nsignificantly increases fuel efficiency.\nTo enable the success of the propulsion\nsubsystem, iSat will also demonstrate power\nmanagement and thermal control capabilities\nwell beyond the current state-of-the-art for\nspacecraft of its size. This technology is a\nviable primary propulsion system that can be\nused on small satellites ranging from about\n22 pounds (10 kilograms) to more than 1,000\npounds (450 kilograms). iSat\xe2\x80\x99s fuel efficiency\nis ten times greater and its propulsion per\nvolume is 100 times greater than current\ncold-gas systems and three times better\nthan the same system operating on xenon.\niSat\xe2\x80\x99s iodine propulsion system consists of a\n200 watt (W) Hall thruster, a cathode, a tank\nto store solid iodine, a power processing\nunit (PPU) and the feed system to supply the\niodine. This propulsion system is based on a\n200 W Hall thruster developed by Busek Co.\nInc., which was previously flown using xenon\nas the propellant. Several improvements\nhave been made to the original system to\ninclude a compact PPU, targeting greater\nthan 80 percent reduction in mass and\nvolume of conventional PPU designs. The\ncathode technology is planned to enable\nheaterless cathode conditioning, significantly\nincreasing total system efficiency. The feed\n\niSat Preliminary Concept Design\nsystem has been designed to include iodine\ncompatible control valves with internal\nheaters and temperature sensors to coincide\nwith the iodine-compatible thruster.\nA key advantage to using iodine as a\npropellant is that it may be stored in\nthe tank as an unpressurized solid on\nthe ground and before flight operations.\nDuring operations, the tank is heated to\nvaporize the propellant. Iodine vapor is\nthen routed through custom flow control\nvalves to control mass flow to the thruster\nand cathode assembly. The thruster then\nionizes the vapor and accelerates it via\nmagnetic and electrostatic fields, resulting\nin high specific impulse, characteristic\nof a highly efficient propulsion system.\nThe iSat spacecraft is a 12-unit (12U)\nCubeSat with dimensions of about\n8 inches x 8 inches x 12 inches (20\ncentimeters x 20 centimeters x 30\ncentimeters). The spacecraft frame will be\nconstructed from aluminum with a finish\nto prevent iodine-driven corrosion. The\niSat spacecraft includes full three-axis\ncontrol and will leverage heat generated\nby spacecraft components and radiators\nfor a passive thermal control system.\nAfter the CubeSat has successfully detached\nfrom its launch vehicle, it will deploy its\nsolar panels, correct for tip-off and maintain\nattitude control before ground contact.\nAn initial check-out period of two weeks\nis planned for testing all subsystems.\nThe spacecraft will charge the power\n\nsystem while in sunlight, using momentum wheels\nand magnetic torque rods to rotate the vehicle to the\nrequired attitude. The thruster will be operated to\nperform maneuvers when appropriate. After checkout,\nthe spacecraft will transition to a more automated\nmode, initiating preprogrammed sequences. The\nspacecraft will use propulsion to lower its altitude from\nits initial orbit of about 370 miles (600 kilometers) to\na circular orbit of about 186 miles (300 kilometers).\nOnce in its new orbit the CubeSat will perform a plane\nchange maneuver, complete any final operational\nmaneuvers and continue to lower its closest approach\nto Earth until achieving a less than 90-day deorbit.\nPropulsion technology is often a critical enabling\ntechnology for space missions. NASA is investing in\ntechnologies to provide high value missions with very\nsmall and low cost spacecraft, including CubeSats.\nCubeSats, however, currently lack any appreciable\npropulsion capability. They are typically deployed\nand tumble or drift without any ability to transfer to\nhigher or lower orbits, perform orbital maintenance\nor perform de-orbit maneuvers. The iodine thruster\nallows iSat to alter its orbital inclination and elevation,\nopening up a wider range of mission objectives than\npreviously possible with spacecraft of this size.\nThe iodine Hall technology enables low-cost planetary\nand human exploration missions. This technology\nallows CubeSats to easily move between various\norbits: e.g., geosynchronous orbit to geostationary\norbit. Leveraging this capability can reduce launch\ncosts by 90 percent and mission studies indicated\na reduction in total mission life cycle costs.\n\nThe principal investigator and propulsion lead for the\niSat mission resides at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn Research Center\nin Cleveland, Ohio. Busek is providing propulsion\nsystem components: thruster, cathode and PPU.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,\nAlabama, is tasked with overall project management\nand developing the flight systems to support iSat\nmission objectives. The propulsion maturation\nis a partnership between NASA and the U.S. Air\nForce. The project will mature and demonstrate inflight technology originally funded through NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nSmall Business Innovation Research program\nand the Space Technology Mission Directorate\xe2\x80\x99s\n(STMD) Game Changing Development program.\nThe iSat mission is funded through NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Small\nSpacecraft Technology Program (SSTP), which is\nchartered to develop and mature technologies to\nenhance and\xe2\x80\xa8 expand the capabilities of small spacecraft\nwith a particular focus on communications, propulsion,\npointing, power, and autonomous operations.\nSSTP is one of nine programs within STMD.\nFor more information about the SSTP, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/smallsats\nFor more information about iSat, please contact:\nHani Kamhawi\niSat Propulsion Principal Investigator\nNASA Glenn Research Center\nHani.Kamhawi-1@nasa.gov\nJohn Dankanich\niSat Project Manager\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center\nJohn.Dankanich@nasa.gov\nAndres Martinez\xe2\x80\xa8\nSmall Spacecraft Technology Program Manager\nSpace Technology Mission Directorate\nNASA Ames Research Center\nAndres.Martinez@nasa.gov\nAndrew Petro\nSmall Spacecraft Technology Program Executive\nSpace Technology Mission Directorate\xe2\x80\xa8\nNASA Headquarters\nAndrew.J.Petro@nasa.gov\n\nModified BHT-200 Iodine Thruster\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nAmes Research Center\nMoffett Field, CA 94035\n\nFS #2015-03-22-ARC\n\n'
