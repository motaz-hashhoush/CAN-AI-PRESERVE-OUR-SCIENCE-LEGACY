Palomar Schmidt log book were used to determine the number of objects that might have appeared in photographic plates taken in years other than 1979. Thus, new positions would be calculated aiding the refinement of the preliminary orbits of these asteroids, eventually leading to their permanent number of designation. From these 109 asteroids, 35 were potentially on 97 plates taken at Palomar between 1976 and 1981. Unfortunately, only 27 plates were readily available and the number of tentative asteroids was reduced to 10. Upon examination of the film, only six objects were found to be in the region predicted by their ephemerides. The position of these objects was measured to the one arcsecond precision.", "title": "Planet-crossing asteroid survey", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T18:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830003754, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Atallah, C.
