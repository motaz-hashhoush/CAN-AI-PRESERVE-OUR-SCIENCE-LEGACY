After the external tank is released, the dccrs are\nclosed. Presently, the device for maintaining the doors iL an open position\nis mounted on the external tank and therefor has a single-mission life.\nThe latching mechanism of the present invention is mounted in the orbiter\nand therefore is returned and has multi-mission capability. The latching\nmechanism is comprised of a pair of concentric nested, cylindrical cams 20\nand 21, motors 22 and 23 provided to actuate the cams, and latch pin 24 all\ncontained within a cover mounted on a support bracket 2b carried by the substructrre 27. A shaft 30 having latch pin 24 is mounted inside the inner\ncylindrical cam 21. Outer cylindrical cam 20 (FIG. 6) has a helical slot\n38 and is rotatably supported at its bottom on bracket structure 26 by means\nof bearings 26a. Cam 20 may be rotated by motor 22 through pinon and gear\n39. Inner cam 21 has a cam groove 21a with a lower, horizontal portion 21b\nshown with latch pin 24 therein insulated, and is supported on bracket 26\nthrough bearings 26. Cam 21 may be rotated by a second motor 23 through\npinon and gearing 40, or ma.y be stationarily mounted.\nMotors 22 and 23 are suitably controlled to advance the door latch pin 31\nand turn latch pin 31 to engage slots and hold doors 10 and 11 open during\nlaunch (FIGS. 2 and 5). When the external tank is disconnected to unlatch\nthe doors, by rotating latch pin 31, then retractinc the latch (FIG. 4).\nWhen the doors are open, shaft 30 will be advanced and finger 31 rotated\nto move its lips 35 into slots 16 and 17 in the ends of the doors (FIG. 2).\nWhen the doors are closed, the latch pin is rotated so that its ends are not\nof engagement with the slots in the doors and then the latch pin is retracted\nso that it forms insulated part of the outer mould line of the orbiter.\nThe novelty appears to reside in a mechanism having a latching shaft mounted\nin the inner of two concentric cams, one having an L shaped slot, the other\na helical slot whereby rotational movement of one cam will result in rotational and transverse movement of the latching shaft.\n\nInventor:\t\n\nPenton B.

Protective doors are provided\nfor the fittings which open outwardly and are latched open\n\n20\t\n\nduring the launch and which are unlatched and closed when\nthe tank is jettisoned. The latch presently used is\ncarried by the tank structure and projects outwardly of\nthe vehicle skin during latching and is lost during each\nflight.\n\n25\t\n\nThe reusable character of the shuttle makes retention\nof the latch desirable and, accordingly, an object of the\npresent invention is to provide a reusable latch for the\numbilical doors which r.ay be retracted linearly within the\n\ni\t\n\nsurface contour of the vehicle after disconnection of the\n30\t\n\numbilical connections.\nSecuential rotary and linear mechanisms, some utilizing\ncams,are known. For _;-:stance, in Carlson U. S. Patent\nNo.3,751,995, a rotatir.s shaft 14 has slots 46 and 48 for\n\n\t\n\nreceiving keys 52 and 54, respectively. When shaft 14 can\nno longer rotate in the initial direction, continued output\ntorque of the motor 22 is shunted from shaft 24 to circular\nspline 32 which now drives spline teeth 42. At this time,\n5\t\n\nspline 32, motor 22, shaft 14, and wing 12 are jointly\nlinearly moved.\nIn Cary Patent No. 3,804,440, a rotary locking bolt\n22 carries a cam follower pin 54, the ends of which ride\nin opposed cam clots\n\n56 and\n\nbarrel 18. The major portions\n\n10 of the cam slots are longitudinally straight to guide the\nbolt axially with end slot held in alignment. Adjacent\nend plate 20, the cam slots\n\n56 have\n\nhelical portions\n\n58,\n\nwhich cause the bolt to be rotated as it is moved axially.\nIn Winn Patent No.\n\n15\t\n\n901,511,\n\naxial end rotational\n\nmovements disengage a latch from a slot on a hinged door.\nNone of the above discloses sequential rotary and\nlinear movements as in the present invention, nor the\nconcept of employing concentrical, contoured cams adaptable in sequence to advance a latch finger, rotate the\n\n20 finger into latching position, again rotate the finger to\nunlatched position, and finally retract the finger into\nnon-exposed position.\nSummary of This Invention\nAccording to the present invention, a latch finger is\n\n25\t\n\nlinearly and pivotally mounted on a shaft between the\nadjacent free ends of adjacent umbilical doors. When the\ndoors are open, i.e. swung together, to expose the umbilical\nconnections, the finger is advanced to a position flush\nwith the doors and rotated to latch in slots in the door\n\n30 ends. When the umbilical conduits are disconnected, the\nshaft and latch finger are first rotated to withdraw the\nfinger from the slots, then retracted to lodge the finger\nin a recess substantially flush with the vehicle surface.\nThe doors are opened and closed by other means to expose\n\n35\t\n\nand cover the umbilical connections.\n\n\t\n\nIMP-\n\ni\n\n-3The sequential motions are programmed through a pair\nof nested cylindrical cams each operatively connected to\none of a pair of motors.\n\nBrief Descriptions of the Drawings\n5\t\n\nIn the accompanying drawings:\n\nFIG. 1 is an isometric view of the Space Shuttle\nOrbiter, particularly the underside including the umbilical\ndoors referred to above.\n\nFIG. 2 is an enlarged underside view of portions of\n10 the opened umbilical doors with the latch finger engaged\nin slots in the adjacent door ends.\n\nFIG. 3 is a schematic underside view showing the doors\npartially open.\n\nFIG. 4 is a similar view of the doors fully open and\n15\t\n\ncovering the umbilical connections.\n\nFIG. 5 is\n5-5 of FIG. 2,\nFIG. 6 is\nFIG. 7 is\n20\t\n\na longitudinal center section, taken on line\nshowing the latch and operating mechanism.\na side view of the outer cam.\na similar view of the inner cam, and\n\nFTG. 8 is a schematic view of portions of the operating\nmechanism with the shaft and latch finger retracted to\nstowed positions in the vehicle substructure.\nDetail Descriptions of the Drawings\nIn FIGS. 1 and 4, the doors 10 and 11 are shown in\n\n25\t\n\nclosed positions, i.e. swung apart, as in flight, concealing\nthe connections 12 and 13 (FIG. 2) in plates 14 and 15 upon\nwhich the door hinges are mounted. The mounting of the\ndoors and door opening and closing means are conventional\nand not :ere illustrated. At the free ends of the doors\nare latch slots 16 and 17.\nFIGS. 5-8 illustrate the latch, its actuating mechanism\nincluding a pair of concentric nested cylindrical cams 20\nand 21, motors 22 and 23 for actuating the cams, and a\n\n{\t\n\nlatch pin 24, all within the cover mounted on a support\n\n=5 tracker 6 carried by the substructure 27. Suitably\n\n\t\n\ni\n-4secured to the substructure is the vehicle skin 28 with\nthermal protective insulation 29. A shaft 30 has a transverse eye in its upper end closely receiving latch pin 24.\nThe latch finger 31 rigidly secured to the lower end of\n\n5\n\n\t\n\nshaft 30, has recesses 32 filled with insulation 33 which\nwith the end 3Oa of the shaft, are protectively covered\nby a cover plate 34 of the densified fused silica insert.\nAt the opposite ends of latch finger 31 are latching lips\n35 for cooperating with latching slots 17 and 18 in the\n\n10\n\n\t\n\ndoor ends, as will be described.\nOuter cylindrical cam 20 (FIG. 6) has a helical slot\n38 shown with latch pin 24 at its lower end and is rotatably supported at its bottom on bracket structure 26 by\nmeans of bearings 26a. Cam 20 may be rotated by motor 22\n\n15\n\n\t\n\nthrough pinion and gear 39. Inner cam 21 has a cam groove\n21a with a lower, horizontal portion 21b, shown with latch\npin 24 therein, and is supported on bracket 26 through\nbearings 26b. Cam 21 may be rotated by second motor 23\nthrough pinion and gearing 40, or may be stationarily\n\n20\n\n\t\n\nmounted. FIG. 8 shows, schematically, latch finger 31\nretracted to a stowed position within substructure 42.\nOperation\n^iote^^\n\n22 and 23 are suitably controlled or programmed\n\nto advance the latch and hold doors 10 and 11 open while\n25\t\n\nthe umbilical conduits are connected thereto (FIGS. 2 and5)\nand to unlatch the doors, and retract the latch (FIG. 4)\nwhen the umbilical conduits are disconnected. In the open\npositions of the doors, shaft 30 will be advanced and finger\n31 rotated to .move its lips 35 into slots 16 and 17 in the\n\n30\t\n\nadjacent ends of the doors (Fig. 2). After the external tank\nis cast cff, cuter cam 20 is rotated clockwise by its motor\n22, while inner cam 21 remains stationary, first to move\nlatch pin 24 through inner cam slot portion 21a (horizontally),\n\nand with it, shaft 30 and latch finger 31 sufficiently to\n\n35\t\n\nwithdraw latch\'_r.s laps 35 from door slots 16 and 17 clearing\n\n1.\n.5the doors for closure by conventional means. Continued\nrotation of the outer cam causes latch pin 24 to ascend\nspiral track 38 and thereby retract pin 30 and latch 31\nto the stowed position of FIG. 4, flush with the Outer\n5 Mold Line (OML) of the vehicle with the latch itself\nprotected by insulation means 33 and 34. Consequently,\nthe umbilical door latch, when not in use,will be stored\nwithin the confines and protecticn of the Orbiter vehicle\nfor reuse during each flight. This will result in sublo stantial savings and improved convenience. The provision\nof the dual motor controls will permit other kinds of\nprogrammed responses than the sequential actions shown.\nThe invention may be modified as will occur to those\nskilled in the art and the exclusive use of all modifications\n15 as come within the scope of the appended claims is contemplated.\n\nORIGINAL PAGE 13\nOF POOR QUALM\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA\n\nreusable latch for the umbilical doors of the\n\nShuttle Orbiter comprises a latch finger 31 for engaging\nslots 16 and 17 in the adjacent free ends of the umbilical\n5 doors 10 and 11, when open prior to the launch, and for\nretraction to a stowed position within the outer mold line\nof the vehicle, when the umbilical conduits are disconnected. The latch finger is shifted linearly to and from\na position abreast of the door ends for latching in slots\n10 in the door ends and is rotated into and out of latching\nengagement with the door slots. The latch actuating means\nincludes concentric cylindrical cams 20 and 21 co-axial\nwith a shaft 30 which carries the latching finger and\nindividual motors 22 and 23 which drive the cams to actuate\n15\t\n\nthe latch shaft and finger.\n\n'
