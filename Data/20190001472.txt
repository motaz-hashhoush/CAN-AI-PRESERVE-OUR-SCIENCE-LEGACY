SUMMARY\n\nThe Booz Allen Team explored market size and potential barriers to Urban Air Mobility (UAM) by focusing\non three potential markets \xe2\x80\x93 Airport Shuttle, Air Taxi, and Air Ambulance. We found that the Airport Shuttle\nand Air Taxi markets are viable, with a significant total available market value in the U.S. of $500 billion, for\na fully unconstrained scenario. In this unconstrained best-case scenario, passengers would have the ability\nto access and fly a UAM at any time, from any location to any destination, without being hindered by\nconstraints such as weather, infrastructure, or traffic volume. Significant legal and regulatory, weather,\ncertification, public perception, and infrastructure constraints exist, which reduce the market potential for\nthese applications to only about 0.5% of the total available market, or $2.5 billion, in the near term. However,\nwe determined that these constraints can be addressed through ongoing intra-governmental partnerships,\ngovernment and industry collaboration, strong industry commitment, and existing legal and regulatory\nenablers. We found that the Air Ambulance market is not a viable market if served by electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles due to technology constraints but may potentially be viable if a hybrid\nVTOL aircraft are utilized.\nThe barriers and challenges we characterized in this study can be stratified according to their applicability\nor potential mitigation through technology as well as market maturity (Figure 1). In the near term, high cost\nof service will be a key economic challenge. We found potential for significant reduction in service cost\nthrough increased vehicle and component efficiency, and automation in a more mature market scenario.\nWeather conditions also pose a challenge to the UAM market, though there is potential for mitigation of\nsome of these impacts through technology such as sensors enabling operations in low visibility. However,\neven in a mature market with advanced technology, disruptions are still likely to occur due to weather events\nsuch as thunderstorms and strong winds. High density operations will likely stress the current Air Traffic\nManagement (ATM) system in the near term, but technology and new initiatives such as the Air Traffic\nManagement -eXploration project (ATM-X) will enable safe and efficient integration of UAM into the National\nAirspace System (NAS). Current battery technology creates a barrier in the near term, especially for the Air\nAmbulance market, as battery weight and extensive recharging times would be needed for these\noperations. Advancements in battery technology, as well as use of hybrid VTOLs, could significantly reduce\nthis barrier in the longer term. As UAM emerges as a viable mode of transportation in the near term, adverse\nenergy and environmental impacts, particularly noise, may impact community acceptance and potentially\npersist as the market matures into larger-scale operations.\nFor non-technology related challenges, we found that infrastructure constraints will create a significant\nbarrier to UAM in the near term but could be addressed in the longer term through development and\nexpansion of vertiports. Competition from existing modes of transportation such as ride-sharing (e.g., Lyft,\nUber) and ground taxi\xe2\x80\x99s pose a key barrier to UAM in the short term, which will likely evolve into competition\nfrom other emerging technologies such as autonomous cars and electric trains in the longer term. Weather\nevents will influence other components of the operation such as passenger comfort (e.g., extreme\ntemperatures, turbulence) and infrastructure (e.g., winter weather causing cracks and degradation in\nvertiports). There is also potential for these impacts to be heightened in the longer term from the increased\nfrequency of adverse weather such as thunderstorms due to changing climatic conditions. We also found\nthat the public has strong concerns about safety as a passenger in a piloted UAM, including \xe2\x80\x9clasing\xe2\x80\x9d of\npilots, unruly passengers, and sabotage. They would prefer that all passengers pass through a security\nscreening process before boarding a vehicle. They would also prefer to use UAM for longer regional trips,\nsuch as flying from Washington, DC to Baltimore, MD or San Diego, CA to Los Angeles, CA. A longer term\nautomated UAM vehicle market will face challenges due to public apprehension about automation and\nunmanned operations, and a preference to fly with passengers they know in an autonomous (unmanned)\noperational scenario.\n\n6|Page\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nNear Term- Immature Market\n\n21 November 2018\n\nLonger Term- Mature Market\n\nCybersecurity of Autonomous systems including vehicles and\nUTM\n\nAir Traffic Management: High density operations will stress the\ncurrent ATM system\n\nWeather: Disruptions to operations during significant adverse\nconditions\n\nBattery Technology: Battery weight and recharging times\ndetrimental to the use of eVTOLs for Air Ambulance market\nImpacts: Adverse energy and environmental impacts\n(particularly, noise) could affect community acceptance\n\nNew Entrants: Large scale operations of new entrants like UAS,\nCommercial Space operations, private ownership of UAM\nvehicles could increase the complexity of airspace management\nand safety\n\nInfrastructure: Lack of existing infrastructure and low\nthroughput\n\nNon-Technological\nChallenges\n\nImpacts: Energy and Environmental Impacts of large-scale\noperations\n\nWeather: Adverse Weather can significantly affect aircraft\noperations and performance\n\nTechnology\nChallenges\n\nEconomics: High cost of service (partially driven by capital and\nbattery costs)\n\nCompetition: Emerging technologies and concepts like shared\nElectric and Autonomous Cars, and fast trains\n\nCompetition: Existing modes of transportation\n\nWeather: Increase in some adverse conditions due to climate\nchange may limit operations\n\nWeather: Conditions could influence non-technological aspects\nof operation\nPublic Perception: Passengers concerned about safety and\nprefer security screening and preference UAM only for longer\ntrips\nLaws and regulations for flying over people, BVLOS, and\ncarrying passengers (among others) are needed\n\nSocial Mobility: New importance of travel time, increase in\ntelecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could\nreduce the viability of markets\nPublic Perception: Passengers trust and apprehension with\nautomation and pilot-less UAM and prefer to fly with others they\nknow in an autonomous UAM\n\nCertifications: Gaps in the existing certification framework\nwhere UAM will experience challenges, particularly system\nredundancy and failure management\nFigure 1: Overview of key challenges by market maturity and technology\n\n7|Page\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n2.0\n\n21 November 2018\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nUrban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging concept of air transportation where small package delivery drones\nto passenger-carrying air taxis operate over populated areas, from small towns to the largest cities are\nbeing considered. This could revolutionize the way people move within and around cities by shortening\ncommute times, bypassing ground congestion, and enabling point-to-point flights across cities. In recent\nyears, several companies have designed and tested enabling elements of this concept, including;\nprototypes of Vertical Take-Off Landing (VTOL) capable vehicles, understanding of operational concepts,\nand development of potential business models.\nWhile the UAM concept may be enabled by the convergence of several factors, there are several challenges\nthat could prevent its emergence and sustainable development, including but not limited to: societal impacts\nand acceptance, economics and affordability, regulations and certifications, adverse weather conditions,\ncompetition with other modes, infrastructure requirements, air traffic management and pilot shortage.\nThere is a need to understand the potential market size of UAM and identify challenges to achieving a\nviable market, as well as how the constraints and challenges could impact the size and viability of this\nmarket. Therefore, the objective of this study is to understand and estimate the potential market size of\nUAM and identify legal, societal and other constraints to adoption of this rapidly emerging technology.\n\n3.0\n\nAPPROACH\n\nThe Booz Allen team adopted a four-phase approach to understand the UAM ecosystem and performed a\ntargeted deep dive on focus markets that highlighted significant barriers to realization. This approach is\noutlined in Figure 2.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nScoping: In this phase, over 36 mission types were identified that can be potentially served by\nvehicles with Vertical Take-Off Landing (VTOL) capabilities.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInitial Assessment: Three focus markets were selected. The assessment was centered on\npreliminary market analysis and evaluation of barriers (e.g., legal, societal, and economic).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInterim Assessment: We refined our methodology and assumptions based on feedback from the\nBooz Allen UAM Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the\nthree markets.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFinal Assessment: The Booz Allen team documented lessons learned and recommendations.\nSCOPING\n\nINITIAL ASSESSMENT\n\nINTERIM ASSESSMENT\n\nFINAL ASSESSMENT\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Market characterization\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Urban area characterization\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Identified three markets for\npotential study\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Select one market for initial\nassessment\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Formation of Strategic\nAdvisory Group (SAG)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Identified five focus urban\nareas for initial analysis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Evaluation of barriers (e.g.,\nlegal, societal, and economic)\nrelated to initial market\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Addition of five more focus urban\nareas for interim analysis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Comprehensive evaluation of barriers\n(e.g., legal, societal, weather and\neconomic) for all three markets\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SAG Interviews and Workshop\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Integration of legal, societal\nand weather barriers with\nmarket analysis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Final report of market\nanalysis and regulatory/\nsocietal barriers\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Feedback on methodology\nand Assumptions from SAG\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Focus groups and General Population\nSurvey\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Defined lessons learned and\nrecommendation\n\nFigure 2: High Level Approach for Urban Air Mobility market analysis\n\n8|Page\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n4.0\n\n21 November 2018\n\nSTRATEGIC ADVISORY GROUP (SAG): STRUCTURE AND ROLE\n\nUAM is an emerging concept that spans multiple industries and disciplines with substantial uncertainty. The\nBooz Allen team established the SAG to provide input and feedback on the approach, methodology, assumptions, and results. The SAG comprised of 51 diverse and independent individuals and groups of UAM\nand/or related market experts and stakeholders. They informed key decision points in this study and helped\nrefine the market assessment methodology based on their expertise.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the SAG captured a wide and diverse range of stakeholders, including manufacturers,\noperators, research institutions, regulators at the federal, state and local level, venture capital, etc. In total,\n35 organizations contributed including FAA (UAS Integration Office, Aviation Policy & Plans Office, Office\nof International Affairs, Office of Environment and Energy), the Volpe National Transportation Systems\nCenter, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), National Center for Atmospheric Research\n(NCAR), National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), North Carolina Department of Transportation\n(NCDOT), New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission, Los Angeles City\xe2\x80\x99s Mayor Office, Pittsburg\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), Smart Cities Lab, Hogan\nLovells, Windels Marx LLP, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Field LLP, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\nStanford\xe2\x80\x99s Peace and Innovation Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology, Stanford University, Boeing, Aurora\nFlight Sciences, Zee Aero, Airbus, Terrafugia, EmbraerX, XTI Aircraft Company, Joby Aviation, Uber,\nGlobal Aerospace, HR&A Advisors, Starburst Aerospace, and GE Ventures.

For\nexample, in the Washington, D.C. urban area, downtown D.C. is defined as city center while Virginia as\nsuburban and Tyson\xe2\x80\x99s corner as an edge city. Urban areas are defined in Figure 5.\nTHE PROMISE OF URBAN AIR MOBILITY\n\nDecongest Road Traffic\n\nImprove Mobility\nCITY CENTER\nHigh-density downtown employment\ncenters and surrounding neighborhoods\n\nReduce Transport Time\nEDGE CITY\nMedium-density employment centers\noutside of the urban core\n\nDecrease Pollution\nReduced Strain on Existing\nPublic Transport Networks\n\nSUBURBAN\nPredominantly lower density residential\nneighborhood with some mixed use facilities\n\nReduce Traffic Accidents\n\nFigure 5: Definition of Urban Areas and promise of Urban Air Mobility\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau (2010), there are 486 urbanized areas (UAs) and 3,087\nurban clusters (UCs) in the United States. Urbanized areas comprise of approximately 88% of the urban\npopulation in the United States. Selected urban areas are representative of the U.S. and captured a wide\nset of operational and market barriers.\nFigure 6 shows the detailed process that was followed to select urban areas. Selected urban areas had\nlarge population and high population density, high surface traffic congestion, favorable/unfavorable weather\nconditions and legal/regulatory environment, potentially large markets, available infrastructure and\ncompetition from existing modes of transportation. Details on the scoping criteria is as follows:\nPopulation Filter: The team filtered out small urban areas to focus on a representative set of large urban\nareas that can highlight the most significant barriers. Two factors used to identify large urban areas were:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPopulation: Applied filter of urban area population greater than one million to select large urban\nareas.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPopulation Density: Applied filter of population density greater than 1000 people per square mile\nto select areas of high population density\n\nSurface Traffic Congestion at each urban area was modeled with respect to the following indices:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTravel Time Index: The ratio of the travel time during the peak period to the time required to make\nthe same trip at free-flow speeds. For example, a value of 1.3 indicated that a 20-minute free-flow\ntrip would take 26 minutes during the peak period.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCommuter Stress Index: Similar to the Travel Time Index but based only on the peak direction of\ntravel. This would be more like the traditional commuter experience of inbound in the morning and\noutbound in the evening.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAnnual Congestion Cost: Value of travel delay and extra fuel consumed in traffic congestion. It\nwas measured in billions of dollars.\n\nHigher annual congestion cost, travel time and commuter stress index reflected high traffic congestion and\nthus greater market opportunity for UAM.\n\n14 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nUrban Area (UA)\nScoping & Selection\nUrban Area Population > 1 million\nPopulation Density (per mil2)> 1, 000\n\nPopulation\nFilter\n\nShortlisted\nUrban Areas\n\nSurface Traffic\nCongestion\nCommuter\nStress\nTravel Time\nAnnual\nCongestion Cost\n\nWeather\nImpacts\nVisibility\n(IFR)\nTemperature\n\nWinds\nRain\nStorms\n\nExpected Legal and\nRegulatory Ease\n\nList of 40 Urban Areas\n\nDemand Sizing\n\nExisting\nInfrastructure\n\nUAS Laws and\nRegulations\n\nNumber of\nAirline Premium\nPassengers\n\nNumber of\nAirport\nFacilities\n\nDistance of Urban\nCore from small\nairports\n\nClimate towards\nUAS integration\nprogram in each\nUrban Area\n\nMedian\nHousehold\nIncome\n\nNumber of\nHelipads\n\nDistance of Urban\nCore and Edge\nCities from Major\nAirports\n\nWinter\n\nList of five Urban Areas\nfor Initial Analysis\n\nPotential Secondary List\nfor Interim Analysis\n\nFigure 6: Urban Area Selection Process\n\n15 | P a g e\n\nExisting\nTransportation\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nWeather Impacts:\nDeveloped\nPreliminary\nThresholds\n\nIdentified Relevant\nWeather Constraints\nWeather likely to\ndisrupt UAM operations\no\no\no\no\no\no\n\nStrong Winds\nStorm\nRain\nLow ceilings / visibility\nWinter weather\nExtreme temperature\n\nAnalyzed Raw\nWeather Data at\nAirports\n\nReviewed each\nphenomena that\nwould influence UAM\nAirport Shuttle\noperation\no\n\nBased on thresholds\ninfluencing helicopter\nand general aviation\noperations\n\nGenerated 7-year\n(2010-2016)\nclimatology of airport\nweather (METAR) for\neach phenomena at 50\nlargest airports in US\no\n\no\n\nMeasured Scale of\nWeather Impacts\nComputed average\nnumber of hours per\nmonth of each adverse\nweather condition\no\n\nOnly raw point\nobservations at\nairport location\nUtilized METAR\ncriteria for each\nweather constraint\n\nExtreme temperature\ncomputed as number\nof days where temp\nexceeded threshold\n\nCategorized\nWeather Conditions\nQualitatively\ncategorized weather\nconditions airports\nbased on overall\nfrequency and\nduration of constraints\n\nWeather Condition Categories\n1.

Moderately favorable weather for UAM: multiple adverse weather conditions are frequent; seasonal variability may\nsomewhat impact UAM usage for part of year; minimal winter weather or wind constraints\n4. Favorable weather for UAM: relatively few hours of adverse weather across year; only one or two types of adverse\nweather condition present; minimal to no winter weather or wind constraints; mostly storms and/or IFR constraints\n\nFigure 7: Weather Impacts\nExpected Legal and Regulatory Ease: UAM use cases did not have historical laws and regulations to\ninform Urban Area Scoping. Therefore, our legal team classified urban areas based on:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nState UAS Laws: Reviewed state and local laws and restrictions on flight altitude and flight\npaths, operational bans, and any regulation of the navigable airspace\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUAS Integration Program: Reviewed each state\xe2\x80\x99s climate towards integrating Unmanned\nAircraft System (UAS) in their airspace\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGA related State laws: Reviewed restrictions of flying private aircraft in each state\n\nThe Booz Allen team qualitatively categorized each of the top 40 urban area (obtained after population\nfilter) airspace based on these laws as:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFavorable regulations for UAM: Phoenix, Miami, San Diego, Orlando\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nModerately favorable regulations for UAM: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston,\nDallas\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nModerately unfavorable regulations for UAM: Salt Lake City, Kansas City, Providence,\nColumbus\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUnfavorable regulations for UAM: New York, Washington DC, Boston, Denver\n\nDemand Sizing: First order estimate of expected market size for each of the shortlisted urban areas was\nmodeled in terms of number of premium airline passengers in an urban area. Existence of premium\noriginating and terminating passengers represented first order highest willingness to pay for premium\nservices. We calculated number of premium passengers for each urban area using:\n\n16 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) DB1B1: Retrieved 2010-2016 BTS DB1B\nCoupon Data by Fare Class\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFare Class Classification: Business and First-Class passengers were classified as\nPremium passengers\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTotal annual average number of passengers for each airport: Since BTS covers a\n10% sample of airline tickets, total number of passengers were multiplied by 10. Average\nnumber of passengers were calculated across 2010-2016\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMarket Size aggregation for an urban area: Number of premium passengers were\naggregated for all the major commercial airports in an urban area\n\nExisting Infrastructure: Early Urban Air Mobility markets might rely on existing infrastructure like heliports,\nairports and other landing sites for near term. We used Federal Aviation Administration\xe2\x80\x99s Aviation Environment Design Tool (AEDT)2 database. For urban area scoping, the team based its evaluation of existing\ninfrastructure on:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHelipads: All helipads active or non-active, public or private are considered part of existing infrastructure\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAirports: Major commercial airports, general aviation and small airfields provide landing\nsites at one side of the airport shuttle trip\n\nGreater number of total helipad and airport facilities was found to be favorable for enabling Urban Air Mobility.\nExisting Transportation: UAMs value proposition depends upon travel time savings. For example, Airport\nshuttle market will add value in the urban areas where distance is large between airports and urban core\nor edge cities. Therefore, the team evaluated urban areas based on:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAverage distance between major commercial airports and urban core / edge cities:\nTarget population included airline passengers flying on scheduled routes between two\ncities\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAverage distance between small airports and urban core / edge cities: Target population included business commuters using private jets or chartered service\n\nFinally, to evaluate all the twelve metrics under six different categories, the team reorganized the data\nstructure by using a normalization technique that was relative to minimum and maximum value of the metric.\nHigher percentage of a metric for an urban area meant higher expected market opportunity relative to other\nurban areas due to that metric. After applying our methodology, we selected five urban areas for initial\nanalysis and five additional urban areas for interim analysis from a shortlisted pool of 40 Urban Areas. We\nselected urban areas that were representative of the US and illuminated wide set of barriers for the Airport\nShuttle and Air Taxi market operated with human pilots or autonomously.\n\n1 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B) is a 10% sample of airline tickets from reporting carriers\n\ncollected by the Office of Airline Information of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

With Urban Air Mobility, as with other disruptive technologies,\nfederal, State, and local-level governments must find a \xe2\x80\x9csweet spot\xe2\x80\x9d where innovation is not stifled, and the\npublic is reasonably protected. Urban Air Mobility operations raise novel and valid concerns, namely in\nterms of safety and privacy, and some legal barriers exist which can discourage the use of such technology.\nHowever, these legal barriers are accompanied by collaborative opportunities such as the UAS Integration\nPilot Program, FAA Rulemaking Committees, the UAM Grand Challenge, and others, which allow for the\nalignment of technology and regulation, creating new enabling rules that allow for more complex operations.\n\n7.1\n\nMethodology\n\nThis assessment identified the legal and regulatory requirements (existing and anticipated) that must be\nmet for the selected three focus UAM markets. It also captured variations in requirements observed at the\nState and local level, international developments, certification issues, and existing opportunities to address\nlegal barriers and gaps.\nOur team examined the law and regulatory conditions needed for the UAM markets to perform in selected\nurban areas under the following operations: (1) onboard pilot, (2) remotely operated, and (3) partial or fully\nautomated piloting system. We analyzed the rules associated with the three types of UAM operations,\nincluding: (1) federal Acts, (2) federal regulations, (3) state laws and local ordinances for each of the ten\nurban markets, and (4) international and foreign law. It is important to note that the analysis draws a comparison of the legal and regulatory challenges for UAM with those of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS),\nespecially as to how it relates to remotely piloted and autonomous vehicles.\nAs a summary, our analysis shows that the remotely piloted and autonomous Air Taxi, Ambulance, and\nAirport Shuttle UAM markets share common regulatory barriers. However, state and local laws range from\ndisallowing drones to protecting UAS operations, which might be problematic considering the \xe2\x80\x9cpatchwork\xe2\x80\x9d\nof laws it can create. Similarly, other nations integrate UAS into their airspace in varying degrees. Moreover, there will be challenges in determining which of the existing FAA certification standards apply to the\ntypes of vehicles being considered for the Air Taxi or Air Ambulance UAMs, and/or how existing certification\nstandards can be met or should be amended. Air Ambulances will require further evaluation due to the\nrequirements of an operator\xe2\x80\x99s air ambulance procedures and sections of their General Operations Manual\n(GOM) specific to air ambulance. Lastly, gaps in current certifications indicate that new standards will need\nto be developed, especially in areas related to system redundancy and failure management.\n\n7.2\n\nLegal and Regulatory Barriers\n\nCritical legal and regulatory challenges must be addressed to bring UAM transportation to the market. Air\nTaxi, Ambulance, and Airport Shuttle UAM Markets share common regulatory barriers. This analysis draws\na comparison of legal and regulatory challenges for enabling UAM with Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).\nMany of the UAM areas are being addressed to some extent with the emergence of UAS operations, and\nUAS research has helped reduce gaps towards enabling UAM. The laws for operations using an onboard\npilot are clearer as they already exist under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 21, 23, 25, 27,\n36, 61, 91, and 119. However, remotely piloted and autonomous UAM operations require the following\naviation regulations (either modification of existing regulations, or new regulations):\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRegulations for operations over people, streets, etc. (currently only with lengthy waiver process to\n14 CFR 107.39)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3\n\nRegulations for beyond visual line of sight (currently only with lengthy waiver process to 14 CFR\nPart 107.31)\n\nRegulations for when air cargo is being carried commercially and across state lines (this is addressed in Section 348 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 20183 whereby Congress tasks the FAA\nwithin the year with making regulations for the carriage of property for compensation or hire)\n\nFederal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2018, \xc2\xa7348.\n\n20 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRegulations for when a passenger or patient is being transported in a UAM either within visual line\nof sight or beyond (airworthiness potentially addressed in 14 CFR Part 23)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRegulations for flight in instrument conditions (not addressed in the FAA Reauthorization Act of\n2018)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRegulations for airworthiness certification of remotely piloted and autonomous aircraft\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTraining and knowledge requirements for pilots and operators (FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018\nSection 349 whereby Congress tasks the FAA with creating an aeronautical knowledge test for\ncertain recreational UAS operators)\n\nAdditionally, a legal framework for addressing privacy concerns should be developed outside of the aviation\nregulatory framework. The recently passed FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 makes a step in that direction\nby mandating the Department of Transportation and National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce \xe2\x80\x9cto identify any potential reduction of privacy specifically\ncaused by the integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system.\xe2\x80\x9d4\n\n7.2.1\n\nFederal versus State \xe2\x80\x9cTug of War\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA dynamic legal environment exists with many unresolved challenges, especially establishing where federal, State, and local authorities take lead. Where the Federal government occupies a field, federal laws\npreempt state laws and local ordinances. The 1958 Federal Aviation Act delegated the safe and efficient\nuse of the airspace to the FAA requiring it to create and enforce federal regulations (under Title 14 of the\nCFR). As such, the FAA has exclusive authority over the national airspace. With respect to UAS, the FAA\nissued its first rule governing commercial drone operations in 2016.\nOn the other hand, the 10th Amendment to the Constitution gives States/local government the rights and\npowers \xe2\x80\x9cnot delegated to the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d States are granted the power to establish and enforce laws\nprotecting the welfare, safety, and health of the public (police powers). This authority can prevent trespass,\nnuisance, invasion of privacy, and a slew of other issues that UAS can cause. However, although state\nand local governments have passed laws of their own, a drone cannot fly freely across city and state lines\nif inconsistent laws interfere with its path.\nA \xe2\x80\x9ctug of war\xe2\x80\x9d exists between federal preemption and state/local police power as each government entity is\nvying for the power to regulate. Not many courts across the country have settled this power struggle. In\naviation tort law there is some clarity, but in UAS operations there is only one case of first impression:\nSinger vs. City of Newton, MA (Sept. 2017).5\nIn December 2016, the City of Newton, MA passed a local ordinance banning UAS below 400 feet and\nrequiring operators to register their UAS and receive permission from public and private residence owners\nin order to fly their UAS over their homes. This local ordinance was drafted \xe2\x80\x9cfor the principal purpose of\nprotecting the privacy interests of Newton\'s residents,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a court document.\nIn September 2017, a federal judge ruled against this local ordinance, allowing operators to use UAS that\nfly below 400 feet and without permission of city residence owners, in accordance with 14 CFR 107 regulations. The ruling in this case was the first of its kind, setting a legal precedent that says when it comes to\ncertain UAS operations disputed in this case, federal law preempts local regulations. A city cannot regulate\nflight operations, and it may not effectively ban drone flights against the express congressional intent to\nencourage drone use.6 Even though the ordinance intended to protect the city citizens\xe2\x80\x99 privacy, portions of\nit extended into the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s operational safety and licensing authority and was struck down.\n\n4\n\nId. \xc2\xa7335.\n\n5\n\nSinger v. City of Newton, No. CV 17-10071, 2017 WL 4176477 (D. Mass.

This program\nwill help FAA craft new enabling rules that allow more complex operations governing the carriage of passengers and cargo, flights over people, and flights beyond visual line of sight. This process was started in\nNovember 2017 as is ongoing as of this writing.\n\n7.3\n\nState and Local Regulatory Arena\n\nAs stated earlier, the analysis on UAM draws a comparison to the UAS legal and regulatory achievements\nas many of the UAM areas are being addressed to some extent with the emergence of UAS operations.\nSimilarly, UAS research has helped reduce the gap towards enabling UAM. As stated above in Section\n7.2.1, the FAA has exclusive authority over the national airspace, and no State or local UAS registration\nlaw may relieve a drone owner or operator from complying with the federal drone regulations. However,\nlocal concerns such as those pertaining to the welfare, safety, and health of the public (police powers),\nsuch as land use, law enforcement, zoning, privacy, and trespass issues are usually not subject to federal\nregulations.\nThough most of the attention paid to drones has focused on the FAA and its regulatory authority, much of\nthe impact is at the ground level. This will be the case with UAM as well. As such, States and local governments have been passing drone-related laws since 2013, citing the need to protect the health and safety,\nincluding privacy, of residents. These state and local drone laws can be seen as the precursor to UAM\nlocal laws, especially when it pertains to remotely-piloted and autonomous vehicles.\nA review of the State and local laws and regulations is important to showcase the evolution of legislation\nwhich UAM could benefit from and face. UAS have many applications including law enforcement, search\nand rescue, border patrol, disaster response, land surveillance, wildlife tracking, and photography. Due to\nthe wide variety of benefits, States and local governments since 2013 have been pushing for regulations,\nordinances, and resolutions which consider the benefits and potential economic benefit of using UAS, while\nweighing privacy concerns. It is important to note that States do not regulate or govern manned aviation.\nState policy does guide where, when, and how much air commerce it attracts. Additionally, airports and\nheliports and the cities who own them enter into agreements for service at the local level, not at the Federal\nlevel.\nBelow is an overview of regulations enacted by each of the selected ten (10) urban areas. State and local\nlaws range from banning drones to protecting UAS operations. These regulations apply to remotely piloted\nor autonomous operations, which is seen as a precursor to similarly operated UAM vehicles.\nArizona:\nArizona has a law favoring first responders.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n7\n\nSB 1449: Prohibits certain operation of UAS, including operation in violation of FAA regulations\nand operation that interferes with first responders. The law prohibits operating near, or using UAS\nto take images of, a critical facility.

The\nstudy must also consider privacy concerns, costs, and timeliness of deployment for each of these\nuses. The legislation also creates a pilot program, requiring the deployment of at least one team of\nUAS operators to a region of the state that has been designated as a fire hazard where they will\nbe trained on the use of UAS for the above specific functions.10\n\nFlorida\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSB 92: Law enforcement may use a drone if they obtain a warrant, there is a terrorist threat, or\nswift action is needed to prevent loss of life or to search for a missing person.

This proposed rule for the certification small-category VTOL\napplies to an aircraft with a passenger seating configuration of 5 or less and a maximum certified take-off\nmass of 2,000kg or less.

This applies to safety critical features, such as aircraft structure, engines, propellers, software, and electronics. Regulatory agencies\ndevelop requirements for airworthiness. Applicants must meet these requirements through \xe2\x80\x9cmeans of compliance\xe2\x80\x9d, which may be based on regulatory guidance. In some cases, the certification authority will accept\nindustry consensus standards developed by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), Society\nof Automotive Engineers (SAE), Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA), and others as\nmeans of compliance.\nAircraft certification can act as a barrier for promoting rapid integration of emerging technologies for UAM.\nUAM aircraft challenge the existing certification process due to novel features and combinations of features,\nsuch as distributed electric propulsion / tilt-wing propulsion, VTOL, autonomy software, optionally piloted,\nenergy storage, and ratio of aircraft to pilots being below 1. Certification can delay deployment of the technologies as they go through certification process that may take several years and can increase costs of\ndeployments if the burden of compliance is high. Certification can also be an enabler as it provides passengers comfort that the standard for safety is sufficiently high. Our research identified trust in the technology as a critical societal barrier (see next chapter for more on societal barriers).\nQuestions considered in this analysis:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHow are new aircraft certified?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWhat is the preferred path to certification for UAM aircraft (e.g., Part 23, 27, 21.17(b))?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWhat are the gaps in requirements and means of compliance (e.g., RTCA DO-178C, ASTM F39)?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWhat is being done to address these gaps?\n\n7.5.1\n\nAirworthiness Certification Approaches\n\nCertification is a risk-based process. There is no such thing as zero risk aircraft operation. The certification\nframework is driven by questions about how society views the operations, such as: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is society\xe2\x80\x99s risk\ntolerance for certain applications?\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cHow strong is the desire for a low-cost solution?\xe2\x80\x9d. For example,\nPart 107 for UAS includes no airworthiness certification for the aircraft. The aircraft and operation are\ndeemed low risk, and there is a strong desire for low cost solutions. As the vehicle size increases, so does\nthe risk and the need for more rigor. As the operation increases in risk, for example by carrying passengers\nthat expect a certain level of safety, the level or rigor is further increased.\nAircraft are organized by category and class, which determines the risk regime that they reside in. The FAA\nand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) certification categories are shown in Figure 9 and Figure\n10. Certification requirements differ by class, and influence design of aircraft and heliports. For example,\nthe following are requirements after critical loss of thrust:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTransport category, airplane class: Certified to 2.4 \xe2\x80\x93 3 percent climb gradient\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTransport category A, rotorcraft class: Certified to 100 ft/min climb rate\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNormal category, rotorcraft class: no min climb rate\n\nNATO\xe2\x80\x99s risk calculation is based on a Military standard handbook for a casualty model based on current\nreliability data compared to the planned test flight route and population densities in areas along the planned\nflight route. Additional requirements are imposed on operations where less risk is accepted. Higher certification rigor means more cost and more time. Certification for Light Sport Aircraft can be in the hundreds of\nthousands of dollars, where Part 23 commercial aircraft can be in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThis tradeoff between risk tolerance and cost will drive the UAM certification approaches.\n\n28 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nFigure 9: Trade-off between risk tolerance and level of certification rigor with FAA certification categories34\n\nFigure 10: NATO STANAG level of certification rigor increases with lower risk acceptance35\n34 Gunnarson, Tom, (Jan. 2018).

This section describes more considerations of the potential\npaths to UAM certification, such as active governing bodies by domain.\n\nFigure 11: International UAS regulatory field (Cuerno-Rejado, 2010)\n\n30 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nFAA certification is supported by activities and standards at NASA, SAE, and ASTM. ICAO is supported by\nbodies such as the Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems (JARUS), Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA), Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR), as well as accepting guidance from other\nnations, including FAA and EASA. This is a quickly evolving ecosystem, and some recent developments\nare not reflected in this figure. For example, ICAO has established the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems\nPanel, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Advisory Group (UAS-AG), and Unmanned Aircraft System Task\nForce/Working Group (UAS-TF/WG) in the Legal Committee36. In Germany, the Volocopter VC200 was\ngranted provisional certification from German Ultralight Flight Association as an ultralight aircraft, which\nprovided a basis for a public test in Dubai. Also of note, Dubai has mandated a remote identification and\ntracking technology, Skytrax.\nAnother consideration in the regulatory landscape is the level of independence of the regulatory frameworks\nwithin specific countries. In this instance, independence is described as the degree to which the individuals\noverseeing compliance are independent from the product development process.\nFigure 12 compares the EASA and FAA regulatory frameworks. FAA has more independent Product Certification. Airworthiness relates to multi dimensions of framework including Process, Product, and Behavior.\nThe level of independence may influence decision of where to certify. For reference, the Independence\nLevels are defined as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c5 \xe2\x80\x93 An independent regulatory organisation or person with authority underpinned by Government\nlegislation. Alternatively, the regulatory organisation or person is fully independent from the\nowner/operator with independent lines of command. They are an external regulator.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n4 \xe2\x80\x93 A regulatory organisation or person who is as independent as possible from the owner/operator,\nbut still within the owner/operator lines of command. They are an internal regulator.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3 \xe2\x80\x93 A management organisation or person removed from the task/attestation development.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n2 \xe2\x80\x93 A supervisor, organisation or a person who is independent from the task/attestation development.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1 \xe2\x80\x93 A person charged with the responsibility for performing the task, the practitioner.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFAA, EASA, and NATO airworthiness share many common elements and standards. Significant standards\ndifferences (SSD) exist and are described in SSD documentation37. For example, comparison of EASA CS25 and FAA Part 25 Proof of Structure terminology reveals a key wording difference, which has resulted in\ndifferent interpretations on the need for and the extent of static strength testing, including the load level to\nbe achieved. The NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 4702 is based on Parts 23, 27, and CS23. CS-VLA has similarities to PART 21.17B. Draft STANAG 4746 is based on EASA Essential Airworthiness and is harmonized with STANAG 4703. STANAG 4746 and 4703 use EASA CS-VLR as a basis. CSE shares similar standards to Part 33, and testing covers all thrust ratings. CS-P shares similar standards\nto Part 35, including demonstration that the propeller can withstand the impact of a 4-pound bird for all\nairplanes. International type certifications are compared in Table 3 below.\n\n36\n\nICAO Legal Committee \xe2\x80\x93 37th Session (Sept. 2018).

New aircraft designs for UAM may have multiple paths to certification with\nFAA, as depicted in Figure 13. The traditional Part 21.17(a) method can be used for aircraft that fall within\nexisting categories. Additional requirements and special conditions may apply. For example, aircraft certifying under Part 23 or 25 must also comply with Part 33 Engine and Part 35 Propeller if applicable. For\naircraft that do not fall into existing categories, Part 21.17(b) may be used. This path is not meant for mass\nproduction, so eventually an update to the regulatory framework may be needed for large-scale UAM deployments for aircraft that take this path.\n\nFigure 13: Paths to FAA airworthiness certification39\nThe General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) suggests that there are \xe2\x80\x9cregimes\xe2\x80\x9d for certification\npaths based on an aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s likeness to a wing-borne aircraft or a rotorcraft (Figure 14).

For example, there are three\nexperimental type certification projects underway ranging from 10 to 6000 lbs., including manned and unmanned. Part 23 Amendment 64 was updated Aug 2017 to provide higher level requirements and allow\nindustry consensus standards to fill in the more detailed requirements. The amendment reduced 377 regulations to 71.

The ODA and DER assess compliance from Standard or Special certification request, as defined by 14 CFR 183, Order No 8100.8D. Technical standards (RTCA, SAE, ASTM,\netc.) can provide means of compliance.\n\nFigure 15: The type design approval process42\nA draft summary of the Part 21.17(b) certification process for UAS is summarized in Figure 16. The Safety\nRisk Management (SRM) is applied by the FAA when developing regulations. The FAA uses the information\nand data supplied by the approval holders and other sources to develop airworthiness regulations under\nthis certification process. The process is driven by identifying risks, which may be based on the aircraft and\nits intended operation, typically organized by classification. Safety requirements are transformed into risk\ncontrols for a product or article. A safety requirement in the form of an airworthiness regulation is a safety\nrisk control that, when complied with, constitutes acceptable risk. Airworthiness Regulations are developed\nwhen systematic hazards are discovered and the related outcome(s) have unacceptable risk. Acceptable\nlevel of risk is determined as part of the rulemaking process and summarized in 25.561 per Amendment\n25-64. There may be aspects of existing regulatory requirements that cannot be clearly applied to new\ndesigns. There may also be new risks that must be addressed through new requirements. For example,\nPart 33 Engines is written with references to piston or turbine engine, so we will need to determine how\nelectric motors will be handled. This leaves questions about what requirements apply, and what are potential means of complying with requirements. This may require developing new means of compliance (e.g.,\ntechnical standards or regulation).\n\n42 AIA, AEA, GAMA, and the FAA Aircraft Certification Service and Flight Standards Service (May 2017).\nThe FAA and Industry Guide to Product Certification, Pg. 15. https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/media/CPI_guide.pdf.\n\n36 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nFigure 16: Part 21.17(b) certification process43\n\n7.5.5\n\nHow Consensus Standards Support Certification: Means of Compliance\n\nA requirement set forth in regulation may be met through more than one means of compliance that may\ninclude regulation, advisory circulars, or consensus standards. Figure 17 shows a set of requirements from\nPart 23, and an acceptable means of compliance through ASTM standards. Some Part regulations depend\nmore on industry standards than others. For example, the Part 23 Amendment 64 shifted from prescribing\ndetailed regulatory requirements to prescribing high-level requirements. It does not prescribe specific technical solutions nor does it have tiers or categories. Many in the aviation community see this as an opportunity to develop detailed design standards through consensus standards for flight characteristics, performance, operating limits, structures, design, powerplant, propulsion, and energy storage.\nConsensus standards could accelerate UAM certification through the following activities:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMaking tiers where it makes sense\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProviding specific technical solutions\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProviding test specifications\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProviding specific compliance methods\n\n43\n\nGunnarson, Tom (Jan. 19, 2018).

These standards support aspects such as design, testing, testing tools, software considerations, and\nverification. We have included some standards non-specific to aircraft that may potentially inform UAM\ncertification such as SAE work on testing automated driving systems, which includes work on validation\nand verification and test scenarios that address identified risks for autonomous systems.\nMany of these means of compliance may continue to support UAM aircraft, however some will be inadequate. The bolded text illustrates standards needed to enable UAM, and that may prove to be challenging\nto which to certify. For example, a clear standard regarding software and integrated equipment onboard\nUAM aircraft will need to be identified for manufacturers and certification entities to enforce.

There is an increasing awareness of current gaps, and potential strategies for certification for UAM. This was recently discussed at a\nCongressional hearing on 7/24/201846.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAutonomous and highly complex software - Software is becoming increasingly complex. Machine learning and other algorithms used for automation are non-deterministic, which means that\neven for the same input, the algorithm may exhibit different behaviors on different runs. This problem is not specific to aviation and falls under the broader topic of explainable and verifiable artificial\nintelligence (AI). It is considered a major challenge worthy of significant investment at the National\nScience Foundation (NSF), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and USDOT\nto name a few.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDistributed electric propulsion/ Electric powerplant - Both propulsion and energy storage pose\nchallenges in an industry that has traditionally worked with engines and liquid fuels. The failure\nmodes will look different. How will multi-copters handle prop failures, motor failures, electrical system failures, and energy storage failures? What redundancies and mitigation measures are\nneeded?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUnmanned/ optionally piloted - The end goal for many UAM business models is to have these\naircraft operate without an onboard pilot. Zee Aero is targeting certification for optionally piloted\nUAM. Because of the operational risks, there are additional airworthiness requirements. There is\nconsiderable work going on in the UAS domain attempting to address these challenges, which\nUAM may benefit from, but the UAM use case may still generate specific requirements.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRatio of Aircraft to Operators < 1 - Several UAM business models include a transition period to\nfull autonomy that may include operations centers with remote operators controlling multiple aircraft. The operational risk of this use case will need to be considered in airworthiness. The FAA is\nholding a meeting in September that I am attending that will explore potential impacts of multiple\noperations.\n\n7.5.9\n\nPotential Certification Approaches for Air Taxi and Air Ambulance\n\nPotential certification approaches for Air Taxi and Air Ambulance markets depends on vehicle characteristics and intended use. There are a range of UAM concepts and some may be closer to a fixed wing (e.g.,\nPart 23) or a rotary craft (e.g., Part 27) depending on their configuration, as depicted in Figure 19.\nThere will be challenges in determining which of the existing FAA certification standards apply to the types\nof vehicles being considered for the Air Taxi or Air Ambulance UAMs, and/or how existing certification\nstandards can be met or should be amended.\nAir Taxi UAMs: Given their sizes, they could be compared to \xe2\x80\x9clight civil\xe2\x80\x9d, which would be FAA Part 23\n(normal airplanes) or a Part 27 (normal rotorcraft). However, given the mission of passenger transport, it\ncould be argued that Part 25 (airplane) or Part 29 (rotorcraft) could apply. Part 23 Amendment 64 may be\nan attractive option if industry consensus standards can be developed to appropriately tier UAM platforms,\ndefine technical solutions, test methods, and means of compliance. If existing categories are insufficient,\nPart 21.17(b) offers certification for special aircraft, which may include leveraging elements from multiple\ncategories in the existing airworthiness regulatory framework, as well as defining new requirements.\nAir Ambulances UAMs: In addition to the certification standards listed above for Air Taxis, Air Ambulance\nUAMs will require detailed guidance for the evaluation of an operator\xe2\x80\x99s air ambulance procedures, specific\n46 House\n\nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology (July 24, 2018).

The certification path will influence time to market and associated\ncosts. Part 23 may offer more flexibility due to its extensive use of industry consensus standards \xe2\x80\x93 but\nthose standards still need to be developed. We also discussed the potential for Part 21.17(b) for special\naircraft, which may borrow portions of 23 and 27, but this is not meant for mass production.\nThis space is continuing to evolve. FAA has Type Certification projects ongoing. ASTM is identifying and\naddressing standards gaps. International entities are taking the lead on experimenting with new UAM certification (e.g., Volocopter).\n\nFigure 19: UAM concept vehicles may fall along a spectrum ranging from resembling fixed wing or\nrotary aircraft\n\n7.5.10 Enabling Strategies\nAs this space evolves, it may be helpful to develop roadmaps for certification paths, gaps, and needs for\nthe various UAM sizes and use cases. The FAA UAS Integration Office recently started developing a\nroadmap, but it is currently unclear how the outputs will benefit the UAM market. Tracking progress of\ninternational entities could help build a more complete picture of gaps and efforts to address those gaps.\nFor example, opportunities for coordination and collaboration may exist. Tracking developments in the automated vehicle space may inform the development of test methods, software considerations, and risk\nframeworks. While this report focused on airworthiness, that is only part of the certification challenges.\nThere are many important challenges in the areas of operator (crew) and operations certification that will\nneed to be addressed as well.\n\n43 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n7.6\n\n21 November 2018\n\nLegal and Regulatory Summary\n\nKey\nFindings\n\nLegal, regulatory, and certification challenges and opportunities exist in order to bring\nUAM to the market. The analysis on UAM draws a comparison to the UAS legal and\nregulatory achievements as many of the UAM areas are being addressed to some extent\nwith the emergence of UAS operations. Similarly, UAS research has helped reduce the\ngap towards enabling UAM. Some of the challenges involve the dynamic legal environment which include many unresolved challenges, especially establishing where federal,\nstate, and local authorities take lead. Additionally, UAM poses legal challenges that touch\non most aspects of aviation, especially in the areas of air traffic control and management,\nand flight standards, but also environmental policy, public use, land use, and local restrictions. However, the current legal framework is starting to evolve to match the technology, especially in light of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. That being said, assured autonomy remains a challenging technical and legal problem.\nMoreover, a diversity in approaches exists whereby States and locales are undertaking\nlegal experiments through a mix of approaches, ranging from designating UAS launch\nsites to hyperlocal restrictions. Additionally, State and local laws range from laws prohibiting drones to laws protecting UAS operations. Similarly, diverse regulations have appeared internationally as well.\nWith respect to certification, many efforts are underway at FAA, ASTM, RTCA, SAE, and\nelsewhere to provide methods of aircraft certification for UAM, but there is still no clear\ncertification path and several gaps in means of compliance. However, opportunities may\nexist to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDevelop a roadmap to airworthiness that considers the range of potential UAM\naircraft and paths to certification.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStudy and leverage international efforts (e.g., ICAO, EASA, NATO).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStudy and leverage efforts from similar domains, such as autonomous cars (e.g.,\nSAE Validation and Verification Task Force).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nExplore other certification challenges for operator and operations certification.\n\nMore importantly, however, are the strategies which currently exist to help the UAM technology move forward.

Research on societal barriers can also\nprovide insight on the potential impacts of deployment. Additionally, research on societal barriers can help\nidentify early technological, market, or consumer challenges to address, such as how UAM can be used to\nimprove airport access or reduce commute times. Societal barriers research can also help provide a\npredictive understanding of supply and demand patterns, such as willingness to use a technology or service\nand under what conditions. Finally, societal barriers research can be employed to help inform public policy\nto help maximize the potential benefits and minimize potential adverse effects of a technology.\nUnfortunately, regional and national travel surveys do not include predictive questions to forecast modal\nshift and other transportation impacts resulting from emerging transportation technologies and service. In\nan effort to study the potential societal impacts of innovative and emerging transportation innovations,\nresearchers often propose hypotheses before a technology/service has been tested. They may collect and\nanalyze prospective data by employing focus groups, surveys, scenario analysis, and other quantitative\nand qualitative methods (e.g., simulators, drive clinics, etc.). After a technology has been deployed,\nresearchers will likely propose additional hypotheses, performance metrics, and data sources for\nevaluation. Figure 20 introduces the steps to conducting research on Societal Barriers.\n\nFigure 20: Research Process for Societal Barrier Studies\nFor this study, we conducted three key steps to study the potential societal adoption of UAM. First, we\nconducted a literature review on existing studies that examine trust in automation, perceptions of UAM and\nother related technologies, and feelings toward the composition and characteristics of flight crews (e.g.,\ngender perceptions, etc.). We then conducted two focus groups to collect qualitative responses and help\ninform the development of a general population survey regarding UAM across five U.S. cities. Two focus\ngroups were completed in June 2018 in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. The participants of the focus\ngroups were engaged on topics such as: familiarity with UAM; their thoughts and impressions of UAM; and\nviews regarding ownership, automation, and safety. In August 2018, we completed an exploratory general\npopulation survey consisting of approximately 1,700 respondents in Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San\nFrancisco, and Washington, D.C. (approximately 350 respondents per city). The survey expanded on the\ntopics covered in the focus groups and included additional questions about willingness-to-fly, weather, and\nnoise concerns. The literature review, focus group, and survey findings are each reviewed in the following\nsections.\n\n46 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n8.1\n\n21 November 2018\n\nLiterature Review\n\nIncreased urban congestion, airborne technology innovation, and autonomous technology advancements\nhave prompted research into UAM as a possibility for future transportation. Our study aimed to identify\nsocietal barriers facing UAM through questions targeting several themes: 1) preferences for piloted, remotely piloted, or automated UAM; 2) technological preferences for UAM aircraft, such as fixed wing vs.\nvertical takeoff and landing aircraft or electric vs. gasoline aircraft; 3) noise and aesthetics of aircraft; 4) the\nuse of UAM aircraft over certain land uses, such as residential neighborhoods; and 5) perceptions of UAM\nsharing and ownership. This literature review provides background on existing literature, much of which\ncovers the topics of trust in automation; initial perceptions of automated and unmanned flight; and preferences for cockpit configurations. First, we briefly review the concept of trust before diving into several studies that examine trust in automated systems (i.e., automated medical systems, automated vehicles, autonomous aircraft). The literature review also details several studies examining the introduction of UAM as a\nnew mode of travel and perceptions of automated vs. piloted flight.\n\n8.1.1\n\nTrust and Automation\n\nTrust is a necessary component of gaining public support for an emerging technology. Care should be\ntaken to understand the implications of trust on UAM public acceptance. In a study of organizational trust,\nMayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995) made the case that trust is a \xe2\x80\x9cpsychological construct\xe2\x80\x9d associated\nwith relinquishing control of a situation to another person or object under the assumption that the situation\nwill be executed safely and well.47 For UAM deployment to succeed, the industry will need to gain the\npublic\xe2\x80\x99s trust and convince them that travel using UAM aircraft will be safe and reliable. However, trust is\nfragile, and can be lost and never regained after a bad experience (Slovic, 1993).48\nUAM confronts many similar challenges to automated vehicles in building public trust. Automated vehicle\n(AV) success largely hinges on public support and adoption. A study by Anania et al. (2018a) found that\nassociating AVs with positive or negative information strongly impacts consumer support.49 When participants in the study were presented with media headlines that contained negative information about AVs,\nthey were less willing to ride in driverless vehicles. Likewise, when participants were presented with positive\ninformation, they were more willing to ride in driverless vehicles than before they had been exposed to the\nheadlines.\nFor this study, the willingness-to-fly scale developed by Winter et al. (2015) was adapted to measure willingness to ride in AVs.50 This is the same scale that we adapted for our study to measure willingness to\nuse UAM. In addition to the different automated technology studied (AVs vs UAM), the study by Anania et\nal. (2018a) measures responses to full automation49, while our study aimed to measure willingness for\nvarying degrees of automation. In addition to positive and negative information exposure, the reliability of\nautomated systems factors highly in consumer trust. Drops in reliability tend to degrade trust in automated\nsystems, in turn leading to negative performance assessments and decreased adoption. Support for robot\n47 Mayer,\n\nR. C., Davis, J.

Carlson et al. (2014) investigated commonalities and\ndissimilarities in a survey of public perception of automation in vehicles and medical systems, finding that\nan up-to-date system with available statistics of past performance was important in both forms of automation52. Respondents wanted greater levels of control and understanding of the system in the automotive\ndomain than in the medical realm. Brand recognition was also important to respondents, as they were more\nlikely to embrace automation from companies, such as Google and IBM, than from lesser-known or startup\ncompanies. In our study, we did not examine brand recognition but we did examine the impact of familiarity\nwith the UAM concept on a person\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to use the technology.\n\n8.1.2\n\nUAM as an Innovative Transportation Mode\n\nThe public hesitation toward accepting AVs is reflected in studies that examine the public\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions of\nUAVs. Of note, a few authors used the term \xe2\x80\x9cUAVs\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to pilotless aircraft, even though the aircraft,\nper the authors\xe2\x80\x99 definitions may have been intended to carry passengers. Tam (2011) investigated public\nrisk perceptions of \xe2\x80\x9cUAVs\xe2\x80\x9d to transport cargo and passengers, and found that the largest perceptions of risk\ninvolved technological reliability and higher perceived safety with a human pilot onboard.53 The study only\nexamined fully automated flight, but with different levels of monitoring (i.e., pilot on board, controlled from\nthe ground, or no pilot on board). Our study examined different levels of automation, from human-piloted\nflight to fully automated flight. Seventy-seven percent of passengers supported automated aircraft, if a pilot\nwas onboard to actively monitor the operation. However, 60% of surveyed passengers had little to no familiarity with UAVs (pilotless aircraft). A limitation to note with the study by TAM (2011) is approximately\n53% of the 158 respondents were between the ages of 50-64; the study results might be biased towards\nthe perceptions of particular age groups53. In a study by Ragbir et al. (2018), survey participants noted\npotential benefits of automated flight such as: decreases in pilot fatigue, human error, and lower costs for\nautomated aircraft.54 However, the benefits were generally outweighed by concerns over reliability; system\nsecurity; lack of a human pilot; and operation under extreme conditions, such as rain, snow, and ice. Similarly, our study examines the effect of different weather conditions on user perceptions.\nA variety of factors work together to influence public opinion of automated and/or unmanned flight.\nMacSween-George (2003) conducted a survey gaging participant interest in pilotless, automated aircraft,\nboth for passenger transportation and goods movement.55 While people were generally unenthusiastic\nabout automated, unmanned aircraft, there was greater support for cargo transportation. Furthermore, educating survey participants about automated, unmanned flight led to greater support for the technology.\n\n51 Desai,\n\nM., Medvedev, M., V\xc3\xa1zquez, M., McSheehy, S., Gadea-Omelchenko, S., Bruggeman, C., ... &\nYanco, H.

(2018b) found that UAV support also varies with racial bias and political leanings.56 Participants in the study were more supportive of UAVs flying over primarily African American neighborhoods\nthan they were of Caucasian neighborhoods. Politically conservative survey respondents were much more\nwilling to accept UAVs than were liberal respondents. While these perceptions will likely change over time,\nunderstanding such consumer attitudes toward UAVs can better inform developers and policy makers.\nA number of studies also investigated differences in perceptions on automated flight based on nationality.\nRagbir et al. (2018) found that Indian survey participants were generally more accepting of automated,\npilotless commercial flight than were American participants.54 While Indian respondents supported UAV\nusage in all but the most extreme flight conditions, Americans only positively viewed automated, pilotless\nflight under near perfect conditions. While our study does not compare perceptions of UAM based on different nationalities, we will have a large sample size (~1700) of American respondents.\n\n8.1.3\n\nPiloted vs Automated Flight\n\nPassengers are less willing to fly on board a solely automated aircraft than a hybrid cockpit or traditional\ntwo-pilot cockpit (Rice et al. 2014; Winter et al. 2015; Mehta et al. 2017).57 50 58 Hughes et al. (2009) found\nthat acceptance for automated flight depended mainly on trust, which in turn was largely influenced by\nfeelings.59 They saw that in general, though, people had a more negative view of automated cockpits and\npreferred a human pilot, even in cases where monetary discounts would be offered to fly in auto-pilot systems. In fact, their confidence in the automated pilot went down for cheaper flights. The participants may\nhave assumed cost-cutting or cheaper flights would be less reliable. While our study did not examine the\ndifference in pricing between automated and human-piloted flight, we did collect data on the effects of\npricing on the willingness-to-fly in UAM.\nMehta et al. (2017) found that, given the option of flying in piloted aircraft of various configurations (malemale pilots, male-female pilots, or female-female pilots) or flying in an automated aircraft (with no human\npilot in the cockpit), survey respondents were least willing to fly on automated airplanes.58 Similar to the\nfindings of the study by Ragbir et al. (2018), U.S. participants were less willing to fly on automated planes\nthan were Indian participants.54 Rice et al. (2014) saw similar results, with Americans having a more positive reaction to human pilots and a more negative reaction to automated, unmanned aircraft than did Indian\npassengers.57 Trust in air traffic controllers could be used as a proxy for trust in remote pilots. Mehta et al.\n(2016) looked at differing support for air traffic controllers based on age, showing that Americans generally\nfavored older air traffic controllers, while Indians were more trusting of young air traffic controllers.60 These\n56 Anania,\n\nE.

Cultural biases can affect the public\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions of flight safety and trust in a pilot, even when there\nis contradictory evidence toward the accuracy of these perceptions. The public has greater support for\nautomated flight with pilots onboard to monitor the system, so understanding the factors that drive the\npublic\xe2\x80\x99s attitudes toward gender in piloted flight are important to early stage UAM adoption. McCarthy, Budd,\nand Ison (2015) observe that women face greater barriers than do men in flight sector participation.61 In a\npassenger survey conducted in 2012, 51% of respondents reported that they were less likely to trust a\nwoman pilot, and 32% believed men would be \xe2\x80\x98more skilled\xe2\x80\x99 as pilots than women (Anderson, 2013).62 Both\nWalton and Politano (2014)63 found that male pilots were more likely to hold a negative view of female\npilots, unless they frequently shared flight decks with women. Walton and Politano note that studies looking\nat aircraft accidents, but did not find differences in accident rates by gender.63\nRice et al. (2015) developed a willingness-to-fly index64 that was used by Mehta et al., (2017) to examine\nthe ways different cultural considerations impact gender biases.58 Metha et al. (2017) found that male Indian passengers were less willing to fly with two female pilots than were male American passengers.58\nFurthermore, Indian males had less trust in young female flight controllers than did male Americans (Mehta\net al., 2016).60\nThese studies show that women face greater difficulties in working as pilots and gaining acceptance as\npilots. Thus, female pilots operating UAM or serving as remote pilots may confront cultural and stereotype\nbarriers that could impact UAM adoption. McCarthy, Budd, and Ison (2015) recommend a focus on gendered leadership differences and positive female representations as potential future solutions.\nOur study on the potential societal barriers of UAM fills a number of key gaps in the literature. First, UAM\ndiffers markedly from both commercial and general aviation in terms of potential use cases, aircraft, trip\ntypes and distances, etc. Additionally, UAM also differs from unmanned aerial vehicles and drones (e.g.,\nsize of aircraft, use cases, the role pilotless technologies when no passengers are on board, and perceptions about privacy). While these studies from other aviation disciplines can provide a baseline understanding that can help shed light on potential barriers with new aviation technologies, such as UAM, actual societal acceptance could vary. Additionally, methods from these studies such as the willingness to fly scale\nfrom Rice et al. 2015 were used to help develop the survey employed as part of this study. Specific methods\nfrom the literature applied in this study are discussed in the survey methodology discussion that follows.\n\n8.2\n\nFocus Groups\n\n8.2.1\n\nMethodology\n\nTwo focus groups were conducted in June 2018 to gain insight on the potential societal barriers associated\nwith Urban Air Mobility from both the user and non-user perspectives.

The study design sought the opinions of those who could be directly exposed to UAM as passengers as well as non-users on the ground exposed to the impacts of vertical take-off and land (VTOL) aircraft\nflying overhead in urban areas. Prior to commencing each focus group, participants were asked to complete\na pre-focus group questionnaire to provide basic demographic and travel behavior information. A copy of\nthe pre-focus group questionnaire and full protocol used for the focus groups can be found in Appendix 1\n\xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General Population Survey). The focus group protocol followed the following structure:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPre-focus Group Questionnaire\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFamiliarity with Air Taxi and Urban Air Mobility\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThoughts and Impressions about Urban Air Mobility\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAutomation and Electrification\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOwnership versus Sharing\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSecurity and Safety\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPrivacy\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConcerns as a Non-User\n\n8.2.2\n\nPre-Focus Group Questionnaire and Participant Demographics\n\nThe research team collected basic participant demographic data including: household income, highest level\nof educational attainment, age, race/ethnicity, and gender of focus group participants. In general, both focus\ngroups had a small number of very low-income participants with household incomes of less than $15,000\nper year and larger numbers of middle-to-upper income participants earning more than $75,000 per year.\nBoth focus groups were skewed toward the upper middle-income demographic.\nIn terms of highest level of educational attainment, 60% of all focus group participants had a college degree\n(56% and 67% in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., respectively). Among all focus group participants,\nthere was an approximately equal distribution of participants with a high school diploma or vocational\ntraining and those with some post-graduate studies. Overall, focus group participation reflected a younger\ndemographic. Forty-seven percent of all participants (56% and 33% in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.,\nrespectively) were between 18 and 29 years old. The average age across all focus group participants was\n36.2 (34.0 and 40.2 for Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., respectively).\nA slightly larger percentage of participants were women (60%) than men (40%). While there was an\napproximate equal distribution of men and women in the Los Angeles focus group, the Washington, D.C.\nfocus group was predominantly female with only one male participant. The race and ethnicity of focus group\nparticipants differed notably across both cities. In Los Angeles, 67% of the focus group participants were\nCaucasian compared to just 17% in Washington, D.C. In Washington, D.C., 50% of the focus group\nparticipants were African-American compared to none in Los Angeles.

The questionnaire first asked participants about their household size, the number\nof drivers, and the number of vehicles in their family. The average household size in the Los Angeles and\nWashington, D.C. focus groups were 3.2 and 3.5 persons, receptively. The average number of drivers per\nhousehold in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. was 2.8 in both focus groups. Vehicle ownership was\nslightly higher in Los Angeles with 1.8 vehicles per household compared to 1.7 in Washington, D.C. Household ownership was much higher among Southern California participants compared to Washington, D.C.\nTwo-thirds of Los Angeles focus group participants owned their own home compared to all participants in\nWashington, D.C. who rent their home. One third of focus group participants in both locations had children\nliving in their households.\nFocus group participants were asked what factors they consider when picking a travel mode. Eighty-seven\npercent of participants (n=13 of 15) consider cost, and 80% (n=12 of 15) consider convenience as the top\nfactors for selecting a transportation mode. Sixty percent of participants (n=9 of 15) consider travel time\nand 40% (n=6 of 15) consider amenities, such as the availability of radio or WiFi. Forty-seven percent (n=7\nof 15) and 13% (n=2 of 15) considered environmental impact and safety, respectively. One person per\nfocus group also considered the number of stops or transfers, as well as exercise, when selecting a transportation mode.\nFocus group participants were also asked about their experiences flying including questions about:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe types of aircraft or helicopters they have flown;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHow often they fly;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe factors that discourage them from flying;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFactors participants like and dislike about flying; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFactors that would cause them to consider flying more in the future.\n\nParticipants were asked, if they had ever flown in a large aircraft (41+ passengers), a small aircraft (1-40\npassengers), or a helicopter. All participants (n=15 of 15) had flown in a large aircraft, and 87% (n=13 of\n15) had flown in a small aircraft. Only 26% (n=4 of 15) had flown in a helicopter. The majority of participants\nfly at least once a year on average. Forty-seven percent (n=7 of 15) indicated flying an average of 1 to 6\ntimes per a year, and 20% flew an average of 6 to 12 times per a year (n=3 of 12). One participant indicated\nthat they flew at least monthly. Yet, despite a large number of frequently flyers, 27% (n=4 of 15) flew less\nthan once a year, on average.\nCost was overwhelmingly cited as the top reason for not flying more often. Eighty percent of participants\nindicated that the cost of flying limited their frequency of air travel (n=12 of 15). Forty-seven percent also\nindicated that long lines discouraged participants from flying more frequently (n=7 of 15). Twenty-seven\npercent also indicated that inconvenience was a limiting factor to flying more often. In-flight entertainment,\nthe on-board experience, and the ability to travel and get away were the factors participants liked about\nflying the most. Uncomfortable seats, vibrations, noise, and turbulence were cited as the greatest flying\ndislikes. Eighty-six percent of participants indicated that more affordable fares would entice them to travel\nmore frequently (n=13 of 15). Sixty percent and 53% of all participants stated that easier access to the\nairport and shorter lines would also entice them to flying more frequently.\nFinally, focus group participants were asked to share some basic information on their preferred travel mode\nfor work travel, non-work travel, accessing a rail station, and accessing an airport. Walking and driving were\neach cited as the preferred travel mode overall by 60% of all participants. Public transportation (67%) and\ndriving (78%) were cited as the most preferred travel modes in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, respectively, reflecting differences in the built environment and public transportation accessibility in each of these\nregions.\nOverall, ridesourcing/transportation network companies (TNCs), such as Lyft and Uber, were cited as one\nof the preferred travel modes for non-work trips by 60% of participants across both focus groups (n=9 of\n15). Driving and walking were also preferred modes by 47% of all participants (n=7 of 15). Taking ridesourcing/TNCs was cited as a preferred travel mode for accessing a rail station (53%, n=8 of 15) and airports\n\n53 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\n(60%, n=9 of 15), respectively. Carpooling to the airport was also a commonly preferred travel mode by\n40% of participants (n=6 of 15).\n\n8.2.3\n\nFamiliarity with Air Taxi and Urban Air Mobility\n\nFocus group participants were asked if they were familiar with the term \xe2\x80\x9cair taxi.\xe2\x80\x9d In Washington, D.C., 50%\nof participants (n=3 of 6) were familiar with the term. In Los Angeles, 44% of participants (4 of 9) had heard\nthe term. Those that were familiar with the term compared it to an on-demand helicopter service, similar to\nNew York City\xe2\x80\x99s BLADE, although no particular brands were mentioned. A few people who were unfamiliar\nwith the term and learning about air taxi services for the first time compared it to a water taxi service. Many\npeople who were new to the term immediately saw opportunities for short distance air travel that would be\nfaster than existing ground transportation. A number of focus group participants were also confused by the\nterm. These individuals were confused because they were not sure how far along the technology was in\ndevelopment and viewed \xe2\x80\x9cair taxis\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cflying cars\xe2\x80\x9d as a future concept from science fiction books and\nmovies. In the Los Angeles focus group, one participant had heard the term Urban Air Mobility from a news\nstory about Uber Elevate in the Los Angeles market.\n\n8.2.4\n\nThoughts and Impressions about Urban Air Mobility\n\nAt this point in each of the focus groups, participants were presented with a video that explained the UAM\nconcept along with a written description. The focus group moderator then answered clarifying participant\nquestions about the concept before proceeding with the focus group protocol. Initially, participants asked\nfor clarification on whether the aircraft take off and land similar to conventional airplanes and for additional\ninformation on how they fly, as well as on VTOL. Participants also wanted to know about how many people\ncould be flown in the UAM aircraft, who pilots them or are they automated, how much noise they generate,\nand if they are safe. Other concerns raised included the type of training pilots receive and concerns about\ninclement weather. There were also questions about security and baggage handling. A few clarifying answers were provided. Many of these questions were explored in greater detail as the focus groups progressed.\nAfter presenting the UAM concept to participants, the moderator then facilitated a discussion to gauge initial\nreactions to the concept, likes, and dislikes. Initial reactions to the concept included:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAppreciation for not having to drive or sit in traffic;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConvenience;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTime savings and the ability to go farther distances faster than driving or public transportation;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe ability to enjoy scenic views while flying; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe concept just \xe2\x80\x9csounds cool.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHowever, not all initial reactions to the concept was positive. Common negative initial reactions included:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe service looked expensive;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConcern that the service will operate similar to a bus (with multiple take-off and landings for a single\npassenger trip);\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nImpracticality for short distance travel;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInconvenient number of transfers as the concept assumes that you have to take a first-and-last\nmile connection using another travel mode to get to or from a vertiport;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDemand would exceed available supply leading to high costs, long waits, or both;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLimitations on landing locations;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLow-level flight could be unsafe or visually undesirable;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGreater safety risks associated with accidents than with ground transportation; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPotentially noisy in urban areas.\n\n54 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nFourteen out of 15 (93%) focus group participants stated that they were interested in using UAM, if it was\nsafe. A few participants said they would only use the service, if it saved them time and money. A few\nparticipants also stated that they would not want to be early adopters of the technology and would want to\nbe sure that the concept had been tested and proven safe. A few focus group participants also said they\nwould use the service, not for time or monetary savings, but to select more attractive routing with scenic\nviews (e.g., flying along the coast vs. driving on a more inland highway).\nParticipants were also asked how they would use UAM. In most cases, participants were interested in using\nit to replace longer vehicular trips in excess of one hour of driving time. These participants stated that they\nwould prefer to use UAM to travel between short interregional destinations, such as Washington, D.C. to\nBaltimore and Los Angeles to San Diego. In general, there was a lot of support for the concept to replace\nexisting short air trips because of the inconvenience of going to the airport. Some participants stated that\nthey would use UAM to avoid vehicle congestion, however, only if time savings made up for the inconvenience of multi-modal transfers.\nThere was some disagreement among participants over whether they would use UAM for work or leisure\ntrips. In general, most participants said that if the service were expensive, they would use it for periodic\nleisure trips and if it were affordable, they would use it for regular work trips. In general participants were\nhopeful that the cost would be low enough that they could replace existing public transit and Uber/Lyft trips\nwith UAM. A few stated that if the service were expensive, they would treat themselves and use the service\nif they got a bonus or a good performance rating at work. There was a perception that this was a service\nfor business executives, but participants were still interested in the service because of its convenience. A\nfew expressed enthusiasm regarding the potential to work while flying on their work commute.\nWhen asked about price, participants provided a variety of price comparisons. A number of people indicated\nthat they would pay 10-20% more than an existing Lyft or Uber ride for the same trip. A number of people\nalso said they were willing to pay a $1 to $2 per mile fee in any direction, or $25 to $40 per one-way trip, to\ngo from the urban core to a suburb or edge city at the region\xe2\x80\x99s periphery. Only one participant in each focus\ngroup stated that she would not use UAM under any circumstances. She said that she wanted to use ground\ntransportation for emergency access/egress.\n\n8.2.5\n\nAutomation and Electrification\n\nNext, participants were introduced to concepts about piloted, remote piloted, and automated aircraft. Participants raised a number of questions about pilot training and whether pilots would be held to the same\nstandard of training as existing airline pilots. There was also some apprehension about piloted and automated UAM. Participants concerned with piloted concepts were concerned about road rage and potential\naircraft misuse. Participants concerned with automated concepts expressed concern about safety, cybersecurity, and cyberterrorism.\nGenerally, participants overwhelmingly preferred piloted UAM. However, in both focus groups, a handful of\nparticipants were open to automated or remotely piloted UAM operations assuming that this would result in\nlower costs. In general, there was a strong sense that piloted and automated UAM aircraft should operate\nand co-exist in the same ecosystem, providing passengers the choice to select their preference and receive\na discount, if they opted for a remotely piloted or automated service.\nIn general, participants preferred the idea of electric powered versus gasoline power aircraft. However,\nparticipants also expressed a strong preference for longer inter-regional trips that are currently only accessible with gasoline powered aircraft due to the present range limitations of eVTOL aircraft.\n\n8.2.6\n\nOwnership Versus Sharing\n\nThere was some interest among focus group participants in private fractional ownership of UAM aircraft\namong family members or sharing a privately-owned aircraft within a household. There was a general perception that if the aircraft were \xe2\x80\x9caffordable\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g., less than $100,000), it could be financed or leased, and it\nrequired less training than a traditional pilots license, then ownership would be preferable. A few people\nexpressed concern about how to insure privately owned or fractionally owned aircraft.\nThere was also some interest among a handful of participants in owning and piloting eVTOL aircraft forhire, similar to Lyft and Uber drivers driving paying passengers in their private vehicles. Interestingly, one\n\n55 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nperson did not want to own an eVTOL aircraft for personal use but only to offer for-hire flights for monetary\ncompensation. Focus group participants also shared a number of concepts for how UAM could be shared.\nA few suggested that an aircraft could be shared by an apartment complex with a smaller scale landing pad\nfor individual or a few aircraft.\nIn addition to sharing the aircraft (as an asset), participants were also asked about their willingness to share\na flight with other passengers. In general, most participants were willing and assumed they would be sharing\na flight with other passengers with some conditions. These included:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA discount for sharing a flight with passengers they do not know (similar to Lyft Shared rides and\nuberPOOL);\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA rating process to rate how pleasant it is to fly with other passengers using the service; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA security screening process for all passengers.\n\n8.2.7\n\nSecurity and Safety\n\nIn both focus groups, the discussion about willingness to share a flight with other passengers that a traveler\nwould not know in advance led to a lively discussion about safety and security. In general, focus group\nparticipants viewed UAM very differently from flying with unfamiliar passengers on board a commercial\naircraft for a few key reasons including:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSmaller aircraft and passengers are unable to get up, if they feel uncomfortable or relocate to another seat or section of the aircraft; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFewer crew members makes passengers and aircrew more vulnerable to safety incidents.\n\nIn general, participants assumed that UAM would most likely be piloted. However, participants expressed\nconcern that the aircraft could be hijacked due to its small size and perceived lack of a separation between\nthe pilot and passengers. As such, many participants expressed a strong preference for a pilot compartment\nseparate from the passenger compartment. Participants also expressed concern that passengers on board\nwould cause harm to other passengers. Concerns about sexual assault were raised numerous times, particularly in an automated scenario without any flight crew on board. Interestingly, many focus group participants said they were unwilling to consider using any form of automated mobility (e.g., shared automated\nvehicles) for this very reason. As such, focus group participants expressed a strong preference for an \xe2\x80\x9cauthority figure\xe2\x80\x9d on board, such as a flight attendant or other employee who could prevent and deter violence\nagainst passengers or intervene if an incident occurred on board. In the absence of a flight attendant or\npilot on board, participants expressed a strong desire for an emergency button to abort the flight and land\nat the nearest vertiport, if they felt uncomfortable for any reason.\nMost importantly, there was near unanimity that passengers should have to undergo some type of security\nscreening before boarding. However, there was consensus that this screening process would have to be\nfree of any lines (e.g., passengers just walk through a metal detector). Participants likened this screening\nprocess to walking through a metal detector at a museum or government building. There was unanimity\nthat any security screening and boarding process should not take longer than 10 minutes from vertiport\narrival to taking a seat in the aircraft, and the entire process had to be seamless all of the time. Specific to\nthe airport shuttle market, focus group participants preferred having Transportation Security Administration\n(TSA) approved screening at the vertiport with an arrival on the airside of the airport terminal. There was\nalso consensus that passengers should have to undergo prescreening to fly to ensure that unsafe or disrespectful passengers would not be permitted on board.\nWith respect to safety, all participants were willing to share their weight information for the purposes of\nsafety and proper aircraft weight-and-balance. When asked about safety, participants held the aviation\nindustry and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with a high level of regard and trust. Participants\ngenerally assumed that if aircraft and pilots were FAA certified that UAM would be safe. There was, however, concern about sabotage or terrorism from outside the aircraft, such as \xe2\x80\x9clasing\xe2\x80\x9d (using lasers to harm\nthe pilot\xe2\x80\x99s or passengers\xe2\x80\x99 vision). Due to the low-level flight and the volume of planes, participants wanted\nsafety equipment, such as anti-lasing glass and aircraft parachutes, in case of a mid-flight malfunction.\nInterestingly, participants also expressed a high dislike for pre-flight safety briefings. Given the potential\nfrequency for UAM use, participants did not want to receive a pre-flight safety briefing every time they fly.\n\n56 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nInstead, they preferred an online course or an annual or semi-annual course that one could take in person\nthat certifies them to flying.\n\n8.2.8\n\nPrivacy\n\nIn general, most passengers wanted to enjoy scenic and panoramic views while flying. However, there was\nsome concern expressed about privacy, both from the perspective of passengers and non-users. For passengers, participants expressed concern that aircraft windows would make them feel \xe2\x80\x9ctoo exposed.\xe2\x80\x9d There\nwas concern that they would not feel secure or people on the ground would be able to see into the aircraft.\nAs such, participants expressed a strong preference for aircraft tinting.\nAdditionally, participants expressed concern that people on the ground would have their privacy invaded\ndue to urban aviation operations. There was a strong preference by participants to impose minimum flight\naltitudes that would limit visibility of individual people on the ground and prohibitions against flight over\nsingle-family residential neighborhoods. As such, many participants indicated that urban aviation should\nnot necessarily be allowed to engage in direct point-to-point travel but should have to fly over existing\nhighways and arterial roadways.\n\n8.2.9\n\nConcerns as a Non-User\n\nIn addition to privacy, there were some concerns raised from the perspective of the non-user. Primary\nconcerns raised from the non-user perspective included: noise, followed by privacy, general safety,\naesthetics, and pollution. In general, the technology was perceived to be safe, if pilots and aircraft received\nFAA certification and safety measures were incorporated into aircraft designs to safely abort flights in the\nevent of an emergency. Of the concerns raised, the potential for noise was one of the most commonly\nraised concerns. However, participants were less concerned about individual aircraft noise and more\nconcerned about total ambient aircraft noise from multiple aircraft operating in close proximity. Participants\nindicated a preference for limiting aircraft operations overnight, particularly in residential neighborhoods. In\ngeneral, the concerns raised from the perspective of the non-user were lower than the potential concerns\nas a user. However, education, outreach, and proof of a safe UAM concept is key.\nKey\nFindings\n(Focus\nGroups)\n\nKey findings uncovered during the Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. focus groups include:\nPerceptions that UAM is a premium service and a desire for the service to be\noffered at an affordable and accessible price point with only a minimal cost differential above ground transportation modes;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA strong preference for longer trips including intraregional trips in excess of a\none-hour driving time in contrast to short interregional trips;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA strong preference for piloted, electric aircraft;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn expectation of cost savings and an on-board authority figure on board with\nremote piloted and automated aircraft concepts;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWillingness to share flights with other passengers and to share ownership of\nthe aircraft, which suggests the need for more research into peer-to-peer business models;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe need for an expedited passenger screening process for boarding passengers;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPotential privacy concerns for both users and non-users; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n57 | P a g e\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGeneral concerns about aggregate noise from multiple aircraft operating in\nclose proximity and safety concerns associated with on board passengers and\nexternal sabotage.\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n8.3\n\nGeneral Population Survey\n\n8.3.1\n\n21 November 2018\n\nMethodology\n\nIn August 2018, we conducted an exploratory survey of approximately 1,700 respondents in five U.S. cities.\nWe created the general population survey and distributed it to a survey panel using the online survey\nplatform Qualtrics, and survey participants were compensated after completion. Potential survey\nparticipants were screened based on their gender to obtain a more uniform distribution of male and female\nrespondents. The survey participants were also screened based on the metropolitan region in which they\nresided. The completed survey target included approximately 350 respondents each from Houston, Los\nAngeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Washington, D.C. For each region, we aimed to\ncollect responses that were a fair approximation of the demographic distribution of the general population\nof each of the metropolitan areas in the study. The metropolitan regions were selected to capture variability\nin demography, geography, weather patterns, traffic characteristics, and the built environment (e.g.,\ndensity, walkability, public transit accessibility), as well as the presence of past or present air taxi services.\nEach of the cities also has unique features that potentially make them more receptive or resistant to UAM\ntechnology, detailed in Table 6.\nMetropolitan\nRegion\n\nTable 6: Five U.S. Metropolitan Regions Surveyed\nFeatures\nWeather\n-\n\nLarge number of helipads \xe2\x80\x93 Infrastructure for UAM present\n\n-\n\nLong history of helicopter services serving offshore drilling\noperations\n\n-\n\nHigh-traffic, with long distance\nand high commute times\n\n-\n\nLos Angeles\n\nHigh level of public knowledge\nabout UAM due to Uber Elevate\n(based on focus group results)\n\n-\n\nLong history of helicopter services\n\n-\n\nNew York\nCity\n\nSeveral high-profile aviation incidents since 2001 including\n9/11 (AA #11 & UA #175), AA\n#587, US #1549, and 2018 Eurocopter AS350 crash\n\n-\n\nHumid subtropical\n\n-\n\nVery hot and humid\nsummer, mild and temperate winter\n\n-\n\nAnnual precipitation: 50\ninches\n\n-\n\nMediterranean climate;\ndry summer and a winter rainy season\n\n-\n\nMicroclimates \xe2\x80\x93 daytime temperatures can\nvary as much as 36\xc2\xb0F\n\n-\n\nHouston\n\nAnnual precipitation:\n14.93 inches\n\n-\n\nHumid subtropical\n\n-\n\nCold, damp winters\n\n-\n\nMild spring and autumn\n\n-\n\nHot and humid summers\n\n-\n\nAnnual precipitation: 50\ninches\n\nSan Francisco Bay\nArea\n\n58 | P a g e\n\nExisting UAM\nServices\n\nExisting app-based on-demand\nhelicopter service (BLADE)\n\n-\n\nPerceived as a tech/early\nadopter market\n\n-\n\nWarm-summer Mediterranean climate\n\n-\n\nPotential for notable societal\nbarriers from local environmentalists including noise, aesthetics, etc.\n\n-\n\nMild climate with little\nseasonal variation\n\n-\n\nMicroclimates\n\nx\n\nSkyRyde\n(fixed wing\naircraft)\n\nBLADE (helicopters and\nfixed wing aircraft)\n\nx\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n-\n\n-\n\nPerhaps different perceptions\non security\n\n-\n\nWashington,\nD.C.\n\nN.

In the survey, we first\nprobed respondents\xe2\x80\x99 familiarity with the UAM concept and then introduced the technology through technical\ndescriptions and a brief video describing the concept. Throughout the survey, we asked respondents questions that probed their perceptions and reactions to travel scenarios in UAM aircraft. Due to the novelty of\nthe technology, we supplemented each of the UAM travel scenarios and any new concepts with infographics and short descriptions. Examples of topics explored in the survey included whether: 1) respondents would prefer automated, remote piloted, or piloted UAM; 2) the presence of other passengers or a\nflight attendant on board impacted their willingness to use the service; and 3) respondents would prefer forhire services or to own their own UAM aircraft. The survey also sought to identify concerns from a non-user\nperspective such as noise or safety concerns (from the perspective of a person on the ground).\nTable 7: Willingness-to-Fly Scale\nOriginal Willingness-to-fly Scale\nAdapted Willingness-to-fly Scale\nfrom Rice, Mehta, et al., 2015\nI would be willing to fly in this situation.\n\nIf I were to fly in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft, I would feel\nwilling.\n\nI would be comfortable flying in this situation.\n\nIf I were to fly in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft, I would feel\ncomfortable.\n\nI would have no problem flying in this situation.\n\nIf I were to fly in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft, I would feel\nconcerned.\n\nI would be happy to fly in this situation.\n\nIf I were to fly in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft, I would feel\nsatisfied.\n\nI would feel safe flying in this situation.\n\nIf I were to fly in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft, I would feel\nsafe (i.e., protected against mishaps and accidents)\nIf I were to fly in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft, I would feel\nsecure (i.e., protected against deliberate and intentional\nthreats)\n\nI have no fear of flying in this situation.\n\nIf I were to fly in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft, I would feel\nafraid.\n\nI feel confident flying in this situation.\n\nIf I were to fly in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft, I would feel\nconfident.\n\nFollowing feedback from the focus groups, the survey draft was refined to incorporate questions related to\nnoise concerns and willingness to pilot a UAM aircraft. We also incorporated the \xe2\x80\x9cwillingness to fly\xe2\x80\x9d scale,\noriginally developed by Rice, Mehta, et al. (2015) to measure differences in passenger perceptions. The\nscale consists of seven statements to be rated using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from -2 (strongly disagree) to 2 (strongly agree) with a neutral option (0). The original seven statements of the scale were adapted\nfor use in this survey to capture the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions of UAM, as well as to compare perceptions\n\n59 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nof flying in piloted, remotely piloted, or automated UAM and flights in differing weather conditions. The\nlanguage: \xe2\x80\x9cI would have no problem flying in this situation\xe2\x80\x9d was replaced with language regarding whether\nthe participant would feel concern. For example, we replaced \xe2\x80\x9cI would be happy to fly in this situation\xe2\x80\x9d with\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would feel satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d The adapted scale in our survey also distinguishes between \xe2\x80\x9csafety\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csecurity.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSafety is defined as protected against mishaps and accidents, while security is defined as protected against\nintentional threats. The revised statements can be compared in Table 7 above.\nIn August 2018, we administered a general population survey using Qualtrics, an online survey platform.\nThe survey design addressed the following topics: 1) respondent demographics, 2) recent travel behavior,\n3) typical commute behavior, 4) familiarity with aviation, 5) existing aviation experience and preferences, 6)\nfamiliarity with UAM, perceptions about UAM, 7) perceptions toward technology and UAM, 8) stated preference and willingness to pay, 9) weather considerations, 10) market preferences, and 11) perceptions\nfrom the non-user perspective.\nThis section includes an abbreviated summary of survey findings excluding analyses of respondent travel\nbehavior, existing aviation experience, the use of SAVs and AVs in a driverless vehicle future, and weather\nconsiderations. The complete analysis including these omitted sections is included in Appendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General Population Survey). Where appropriate, we have also noted the page number of\nthe appendix where figures and tables not critical to the abbreviated text may be found.\nMethodological Limitations: Survey-based research is a useful technique for gathering a wide range of\ndata about a population such as the attitudes, behavior, and characteristics of the survey population.\nSurveys are relatively easy to administer and offer flexibility in data collection. However, limitations exist\nwith this methodological approach. For example, responses to survey questions are self-reported and are\nsubject to respondent bias. It is also possible that a survey questionnaire may not evoke truthful responses\nfrom the sample population (Ponto, 2015). Another possible source of error could occur due to priming and\nsurvey questions must be carefully ordered and worded to prevent influencing how people respond to\nsubsequent questions. Finally, it is challenging for individuals to respond to an innovation without having\ndirect experience with it. This impacts a respondent\xe2\x80\x99s ability to answer questions based upon limited to no\nexperiential understanding. Our survey results likely reflect this limitation. In the future, we recommend\nconducting a survey with early adopters or using a flying simulator, for instance.\n\n8.3.2\n\nRespondent Demographics\n\nOur survey collected basic demographic information of respondents including: household income, education, age, race/ethnicity, gender, and type of housing. Table 8 below provides a summary of each of these\ndemographic categories across all respondents as well as disaggregated per city. Table 8 also provides\nthe 2016 American Community Survey (ACS) data as a reference point for the demographic distribution of\neach city.\nIn general, the respondents represented the distribution of household income levels across the cities, with\nslight underrepresentation of the highest income brackets (respondents with more than $150,000 in household income). Across the cities, the respondents of the San Francisco Bay Area and New York tended to\nfall into higher income brackets. In terms of educational attainment, the respondents were skewed towards\nthose who had attained a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s or graduate degree (36% with a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree and 32% with a\ngraduate degree or currently in graduate school). Only 1% of the respondent population had less than a\nhigh school degree, while the average across the cities in the 2016 ACS survey was closer to 16%.\nOverall, the respondent population reflected the 2016 ACS age distribution. The distribution is slightly biased toward a younger demographic (those 25 to 34 years of age), but there is also a slight overrepresentation of respondents in the 65 to 74 age group (17% in the survey population vs 7% in the general population). Los Angeles was skewed more heavily towards a younger population, where 44% of the respondents were between 18 to 34 years of age. With respect to race and ethnicity, approximately 55% of respondents were White/Caucasian. Hispanics or Latinos were underrepresented by the survey population\nat approximately 10% of respondents. In Houston and Los Angeles, this underrepresentation was a bit\nmore prominent. For example, Los Angeles has a population that is 45% Hispanic or Latino, but only 15%\nof survey respondents were Hispanic or Latino. Across the entire sample of survey respondents, a slightly\nlarger percentage of women (57%) participated in the survey than men (43%). For housing, respondents in\nNew York tended to live in the highest density housing, with 77% living in buildings with more than 10 units.\n\n60 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nRespondents in Houston lived in the lowest density housing, with 61% living in detached single-family\nhomes.\nTable 8: Demographic Data\nTotal\nHOUSEHOLD INCOME\n2016 ACS Survey\nLess than $10,000\n6%\n5%\n$10,000 - $14,999\n4%\n4%\n$15,000 - $24,999\n8%\n8%\n$25,000 - $49,999\n18% 16%\n$50,000 - $74,999\n16% 16%\n$75,000 - $99,999\n12% 14%\n$100,000 - $149,999\n16% 13%\n$150,000 - $199,999\n8%\n7%\n$200,000 or more\n11%\n9%\nEDUCATION\n2016 ACS Survey\nLess than high\n16%\n1%\nschool/Currently in High\nSchool\nHigh school graduate\n22% 13%\n(includes equivalency)\nSome college, no\n18%\n5%\ndegree/Currently in\nCollege\nAssociate\'s degree\n7% 10%\nBachelor\'s degree\n23% 36%\n15% 32%\nGraduate or professional\ndegree/Currently in postgraduate degree\nAGE\n2016 ACS Survey\n18 - 24 years\n9%\n9%\n25 - 34 years\n15% 26%\n35 - 44 years\n14% 18%\n45 - 54 years\n14% 13%\n55 - 64 years\n12% 16%\n65 - 74 years\n7% 17%\n75+ years\n6%\n5%\nRACE\n2016 ACS Survey\nHispanic or Latino\n30% 10%\nWhite alone\n41% 55%\nBlack or African American alone14% 16%\nAmerican Indian or\n0%\n1%\nAlaska Native alone\nAsian alone\n13% 12%\nNative Hawaiian or\n0%\n0%\nPacific Islander alone\nOther alone\n0%\n2%\nTwo or more races\n2%\n2%\nGENDER\n2016 ACS Survey\nFemale\n51% 57%\nMale\n49% 43%\nHOUSING TYPE\n2016 ACS Survey\nDetached single-family home 46% 43%\nBuilding/house with\n26% 19%\nfewer than 10 units\nBuilding with between\n23%\n10 and 100 units\n27%\nBuilding with more than\n14%\n100 units\nMobile home/RV/Trailer\n1%\n1%\n\n61 | P a g e\n\nHouston\nSan Francisco Bay Area Los Angeles Washington, D.C.

Only 23% of the respondents were familiar with the concept of\nUAM. Analyzing familiarity with UAM by demographic categories, we found that familiarity was slightly\nhigher in Los Angeles (32%) than the other cities, possibly due to Uber Elevate announcing Los Angeles\nas one of the two first launch cities with plans to commence commercial operations in the region as soon\nas 2023. Men tended to be more familiar with UAM than women, at 30% and 19%, respectively. Age appeared to be correlated with familiarity with the concept, with Millennials and Gen Xers reporting higher\nlevels of familiarity (Figure 21).\n\nAre you familiar with the concept of Urban Air Mobility?\n80%\n70%\n\n70%\n\n65%\n58%\n\n60%\n\n68%\n\n63%\n\n53%\n\n50%\n40%\n\n30%\n\n32%\n25%\n\n17%\n\n20%\n\n24%\n11%\n\n10%\n\n16%\n\n15%\n\n23%\n\n20%\n\n13%\n\n14%\n\n13%\n\n0%\n\nHouston,\nN = 338\n\nSan Francisco Bay\nArea,\nN = 339\n\nLos Angeles,\nN = 340\nYes\n\nNo\n\n80%\n70%\n56%\n\n60%\n\nWashington, D.C.,\nN = 341\n\nTotal,\nN = 1702\n\nI am not sure\n\n75%\n\n68%\n\n63%\n\nNew York City,\nN = 343\n\n70%\n\n72%\n\n54%\n\n50%\n40%\n30%\n\n36%\n\n31%\n\n20%\n\n13%\n\n10%\n\n29%\n10%\n\n8%\n\n14%\n\n18%\n\n13%\n\n12%\n\n12%\n\n19%\n\n18%\n10%\n\n0%\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nI am not sure\n\nFigure 21: Survey responses to UAM familiarity\n\n8.3.4\n\nTravel Behavior\n\nOne of the objectives of this research project was to explore potential markets and future use cases for\nUAM. Examples of future use cases include: 1) air taxis, a service primarily used to access airports or 2)\nemergency travel, such as air ambulances. To inform this market analysis, respondents were asked a series\nof questions regarding their most recent non-commute trip. By targeting the most recent non-commute trip,\nthe survey aimed to capture a glimpse into the travel behavior of the populations of each of the five U.S.\n\n62 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\ncities. Respondents were asked the purpose of their most recent trip, the modes used to travel to the destination, and the distance traveled of the trip. For detailed information on the existing travel behavior of\nsurvey respondents, please see Appendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General Population Survey).\n\n8.3.5\n\nFamiliarity with Aviation and Existing Preferences\n\nWe wanted to measure the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 comfort with using air travel and identify any barriers to UAM\nbased on previous aviation experience. To gauge the respondent\xe2\x80\x99s familiarity with aviation, respondents\nwere first asked to identify if they had flown on four types of aircraft: 1) a large airplane (81+ passengers),\n2) a regional airplane (41-80 respondents), 3) a small airplane (1-40 passengers), and 4) a helicopter. For\neach aircraft, respondents were shown a representative image of the aircraft type. According to a study by\nAirlines for America (Heimlich & Jackson, 2017), 89% of Americans have traveled by airline at some point\nin their lifetime. Similarly, 87% of the respondents had flown in large airplanes and 74% had flown in regional airplanes at least once. The respondent population was familiar with flight, but a smaller proportion\nof the population had flown in small aircraft. Approximately half of the respondents had flown in small airplanes (1-40 passengers), and 29% had flown in a helicopter. For more information on the existing aviation\npreferences of survey respondents, please see Appendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General Population\nSurvey).\n\n8.3.6\n\nUAM Perceptions\n\nAs mentioned previously, the survey respondents were introduced to the concept of UAM through a short\nvideo clip and description of the technology. The video clip was approximately a minute and a half long,\nand it consisted of Uber Elevate\xe2\x80\x99s promotional introduction to their future urban air ridesourcing product,\nUber Air. In the promotional video, viewers follow the steps of an individual taking a piloted UAM trip for\ntheir commute home. For the survey introduction to UAM, we edited the video clip to remove Uber logos,\nand the final 12 seconds of the video were removed to eliminate references to Uber Air. The following\ndefinition prefaced the video in our survey:\n\xe2\x80\x9cUrban Air Mobility (UAM) is a safe and efficient system for air passenger transportation within an urban\narea. UAM supports a mix of onboard/ground-piloted and increasingly automated operations.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAfter the introduction of UAM, we asked the respondents to select from a series of emotional states that\nmatched their initial reaction. Overall, UAM invoked a positive to neutral response, with some skepticism.\nThe initial feelings were consistent across all cities; however, variation existed across other demographic\ncategories. For initial reactions, 36% of male respondents selected \xe2\x80\x9cExcited\xe2\x80\x9d compared to 26% of female\nrespondents. Excitement for the concept tended to be correlated with household income, perhaps due to\nperceived service cost. This corresponds with the written responses of several participants who expressed\nconcerns that UAM would be a mode used predominantly by higher income travelers. Younger respondents\ntended to be more excited about the concept, while skepticism tended to increase with age. Table 19 in\nAppendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General Population Survey) presents the initial reactions of the respondents, disaggregated by demographic categories.\nNext, we introduced respondents to the willingness-to-fly scale, which was presented in Table 7 above.\nRespondents were asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale eight statements intended to capture their UAM\ntravel perceptions. Respondents were cautiously optimistic about the idea of flying in a UAM aircraft. Of the\naggregated respondents, 55% were willing to fly in a UAM aircraft, and 50% assumed they would be comfortable in a UAM aircraft. However, only approximately 36 to 37% believed they would feel safe and secure\nflying in a UAM aircraft. For each statement regarding UAM aircraft feelings (willingness, safety, fear, concern), approximately one a third of the respondents were neutral. This neutrality might be influenced by the\nlack of personal experience with this technology; some of the respondents might have difficulty imagining\ntheir reaction. A follow-up study could capture more reactions to UAM flight simulators or actual flights. Men\nwere more slightly more comfortable and willing to use UAM than women, and willingness to use UAM was\nhighest among Millennials.

For our study,\nrespondents chose one of five ordered responses for their willingness to use UAM: \xe2\x80\x9cStrongly agree,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgree,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNeutral,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDisagree,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cStrongly disagree.\xe2\x80\x9d The socio-demographic variables considered included age, education, household income, race/ethnicity, and gender. The respondents\xe2\x80\x99 commute distance\nin miles was used as a stand-in variable for congestion. Finally, familiarity with the UAM concept was included as an independent variable. Before building the ordinal regression model, crosstabs were performed\non each of the socio-economic variables to identify overarching trends and important variables for regression analysis. From the crosstabs presented in Table 20 in Appendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General\nPopulation Survey), the survey team expected that age, gender, and income will be significant variables\nin the ordinal logistic regression model.\nModel estimation was completed using the ordinal package in R. The ordinal regression model is displayed\nin Table 21 in Appendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General Population Survey). Positive coefficients indicate that the variable increases willingness to fly. The variables for age, gender, and familiarity with the\nUAM concept before the survey are the most significant variables. The coefficient for age was negative,\nindicating that older respondents were less willing to fly. The coefficients for male gender and \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d for\nfamiliarity were positive. Commute distance and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity were significant, but less influential. Both had positive coefficients, indicating that respondents with longer commutes and Hispanic/Latino\nrespondents tended to be willing to fly in UAM aircraft.\n\n8.3.7\n\nPerceptions Toward Technology and UAM\n\nThrough a series of scenarios with varying degrees of automation, we also explored the public\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions\ntowards the level of automation of UAM aircraft. We presented five scenarios to the respondent: flying in\n(1) an automated aircraft, (2) a remotely piloted aircraft with a flight attendant on board, (3) a remotely\npiloted aircraft without a flight attendant on board, (4) an automated aircraft with a flight attendant on board,\nand (5) an automated aircraft without a flight attendant on board. As noted in the methodology, we showed\n\n64 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nrespondents infographics representing each of the three levels of automation (automated, remotely piloted,\nand piloted) to help the respondents visualize the scenarios. For each of these scenarios, the respondents\nwere asked if they would be willing to fly alone, with other passengers that they knew, and with passengers\nthey did not know.\nOf the respondents who were willing to fly in a UAM aircraft, the respondents preferred to travel with other\npassengers that they knew (Figure 23). However, respondents were more willing to fly alone or with\nstrangers in a piloted aircraft. The presence of a flight attendant only very slightly increased willingness to\nfly in remotely piloted or automated aircraft. We also explored the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions of comfort\n(Figure 23) and safety and security (Figure 24). For this study, we defined safety as \xe2\x80\x9cprotected against\nmishaps and accidents,\xe2\x80\x9d and security is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cprotected against deliberate and intentional threats.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe respondents\xe2\x80\x99 answers were closely correlated to their willingness to fly \xe2\x80\x93 respondents felt more safe,\nsecure, and comfortable in piloted aircraft than in remotely piloted or automated aircraft. As displayed in\nFigure 23 and Figure 24, the presence of a flight attendant had a slight effect on respondents\xe2\x80\x99 feelings\ntoward travel in a remotely piloted or automated aircraft; approximately 5 to 10% more respondents felt\ncomfortable, safe, and secure traveling in a UAM aircraft if a flight attendant was on board. However, these\nresults may be affected by lack of experience with UAM or survey fatigue. It is possible that survey respondents would have had difficulty visualizing the different levels of automation and gauging their feelings toward\nUAM flight.\n\nPlease select whether you would be willing to travel in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft in\nthe following situations (i.e., piloted, remotely piloted, or automated) by yourself,\nand/or with other people on board.\n68%\n\n80%\n60%\n\n53%\n\n52%\n\n40%\n\n52%\n30%\n\n28%\n\n48%\n\n43%\n\n20%\n\n24%\n\n23%\n\n41%\n27%\n\n27%\n\n22%\n\n21%\n\n0%\n\nPiloted,\nN = 1722\n\nAlone\n\nRemotely piloted, Automated, with a flight Automated, without a\nwithout a flight\nattendant on board,\nflight attendant on\nattendant on board,\nN = 1722\nboard,\nN = 1722\nN = 1722\n\nWith other passengers, whom I know\n\nWith other passengers, whom I do not know\n\nPlease select whether you would be comfortable traveling in an Urban Air Mobility\naircraft in the following situations (i.e., piloted, remotely piloted, or automated) by\nyourself, and/or with other people on board.\n\n80%\n60%\n\nRemotely piloted, with\na flight attendant on\nboard,\nN = 1722\n\n66%\n\n53%\n\n50%\n\n49%\n\n40%\n\n27%\n\n47%\n\n41%\n28%\n\n20%\n\n21%\n\n24%\n\n24%\n\n40%\n26%\n\n21%\n\n20%\n\n0%\nPiloted,\nN = 1722\n\nAlone\n\nRemotely piloted, with\na flight attendant on\nboard,\nN = 1722\n\nRemotely piloted, Automated, with a flight Automated, without a\nwithout a flight\nattendant on board,\nflight attendant on\nattendant on board,\nN = 1722\nboard,\nN = 1722\nN = 1722\n\nWith other passengers, whom I know\n\nWith other passengers, whom I do not know\n\nFigure 23: Perceptions of willingness and comfort\n\n65 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nPlease select whether you would feel safe (protected against mishaps and accidents)\ntraveling in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft in the following situations (i.e., piloted,\nremotely piloted, or automated) by yourself, and/or with other people on board.\n\n80%\n\n66%\n52%\n\n60%\n\n49%\n\n40%\n\n48%\n26%\n\n44%\n\n39%\n26%\n\n21%\n\n20%\n\n20%\n\n38%\n\n23%\n\n23%\n\n21%\n\n19%\n\n0%\n\nPiloted,\nN = 1722\nAlone\n\nRemotely piloted, with\nRemotely piloted,\nAutomated, with a\nAutomated, without a\na flight attendant on\nwithout a flight\nflight attendant on\nflight attendant on\nboard,\nattendant on board,\nboard,\nboard,\nN = 1722\nN = 1722\nN = 1722\nN = 1722\nWith other passengers, whom I know\nWith other passengers, whom I do not know\n\nPlease select whether you would feel secure (protected against deliberate and\nintentional threats) traveling in an Urban Air Mobility aircraft in the following situations\n(i.e., piloted, remotely piloted, or automated) by yourself, and/or with other peopl\n\n80%\n\n65%\n\n60%\n\n49%\n\n47%\n\n45%\n\n40%\n\n26%\n\n45%\n\n40%\n\n24%\n\n20%\n\n20%\n\n23%\n\n19%\n\n38%\n22%\n\n20%\n\n18%\n\n0%\nPiloted,\nN = 1722\n\nAlone\n\nRemotely piloted, with\na flight attendant on\nboard,\nN = 1722\n\nRemotely piloted,\nwithout a flight\nattendant on board,\nN = 1722\n\nWith other passengers, whom I know\n\nAutomated, with a\nflight attendant on\nboard,\nN = 1722\n\nAutomated, without a\nflight attendant on\nboard,\nN = 1722\n\nWith other passengers, whom I do not know\n\nFigure 24: Perceptions of safety and security\n\n8.3.8\n\nStated Preference & Willingness to Pay\n\nThe survey also contained a block of stated preference (SP) questions meant to capture participants\xe2\x80\x99 preferences for UAM travel. The respondents were presented five hypothetical trips, each varying randomly in\nthree attributes: trip purpose, trip cost, and distance traveled. The levels of each attribute are shown in\nTable 9. The respondents were presented one trip at a time and asked to choose whether they would\nconsider taking the trip \xe2\x80\x93 a dichotomous outcome of either \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I would take this trip\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I would not\ntake this trip.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTable 9: Stated Preference Attributes\nAttribute\n\nLevel\n\nTrip Purpose\n\nGoing to Airport, Going to Work/School, Recreational (excludes work trips)\n\nCost (One-Way)\n\n$12, $26, $48, $72, $93, $145\n\nDistance (Miles)\n\n5, 12, 23, 36, 46, 60\n\n66 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nBefore the five hypothetical scenarios, the respondents were presented a practice scenario to set a reference point for UAM travel cost for the set of SP questions. The practice scenario was identical for all respondents, with trip purpose set to \xe2\x80\x9cGoing to Work/School\xe2\x80\x9d, cost set to $50, and distance set to 10 miles.\nThe pricing was set to $5 per mile based on an estimate from Uber Air. Uber estimates that their on-demand\nelectric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVOTL) taxis will initially cost $5.73 per passenger mile (Dickey,\n2018).\nThe outcome data from the SP questions were used to build a logistic regression model with the binary\noutcome (\xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d to taking the trip) as the dependent variable, and the trip attributes and respondent\ncharacteristics as the predictor variables. The logistic regression model was created in R using the glm\nfunction. Model results are shown in the extended survey summary in Table 22 of Appendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal\nBarriers (General Population Survey).\nEach of the attributes of the stated preference scenarios \xe2\x80\x93 trip purpose, cost, and distance \xe2\x80\x93 were statistically significant predictors for the decision to take a UAM trip. For every one mile increase in trip distance,\nthe logarithm of the odds of the respondent taking the trip increases by 0.018. For every one dollar increase\nin trip cost, the logarithm of the odds of the respondent taking the trip decreases by 0.0213. If the purpose\nof the trip is going to work or school, versus going to the airport, the logarithm of the odds of taking the trip\ndecrease by 0.715. If the purpose of the trip is recreational, as opposed to going to the airport, the logarithm\nof the odds of taking the trip decrease by 0.141. These results indicate that UAM travel would be more\nsuccessful for trips that are longer, and respondents were not as interested in using UAM aircraft for commuting as they were for recreational trips or trips to the airport.\nSimilar to the results of the ordinal logistic regression model, age, gender, and familiarity with the concept\nof UAM were statistically significant predictors of whether a person would take a UAM trip. Younger respondents, male respondents, and respondents familiar with UAM prior to the survey were more likely to\ntake a UAM trip. The coefficient for income was statistically significant and positive, indicating respondents\nwith higher income were more likely to take UAM trips. Survey respondents from Los Angeles were more\nlikely to agree to take a trip compared to respondents from Houston, and respondents from the San Francisco Bay Area were less likely to agree to take a UAM trip compared to respondents from Houston.\nIn order to measure how well the logistic regression model fits, the research team tested whether the model\nwith predictors fits significantly better than a null model using a likelihood ratio test. The test statistic used\nis the difference in residual deviance between our model and a null model. We obtained a chi-square of\n2544 with 30 degrees of freedom and an associated p-value of 0, indicating that the estimated model fits\nsignificantly better than a null model. The log-likelihood of our model was -5290.\nThe null deviance of the model is 13123 on 10201 degrees of freedom. The residual deviance is 10579 n\n10171 degrees of freedom. The AIC is 10641, and the number of Fisher Scoring iterations is 4.\nThe research team also estimated the willingness-to-pay for distance traveled. The ratio of coefficients\n(\xce\xb2trip_distance/\xce\xb2trip_cost) represents the survey respondent\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to pay for additional miles traveled. In\nour model, \xce\xb2trip_distance is estimated to be .018 and \xce\xb2trip_cost is estimated to be -0.0213, implying that the respondents were willing to pay approximately 0.85 dollars more for a trip whose distance is one mile longer.\n\n8.3.9\n\nWeather Considerations\n\nNaturally, weather conditions impacted the willingness of a respondent to fly in a UAM aircraft. While a\nsignificant portion of the respondents (more than 50% in each of the weather scenarios, and as high as\n81% for hot and cold conditions) were willing to fly in a UAM aircraft under adverse weather conditions,\nrespondents reported increased levels of fear and concern. The survey respondents were apprehensive\ntowards flying in rain, snow, low visibility, and turbulence, while they tended to be indifferent to hot and cold\nweather conditions. Respondents were the most afraid of snow (54%), fog/low visibility (57%), and turbulence (54%). For more information on how weather scenarios impacted survey respondents\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions of\nUAM, please see Appendix 13.1.5.\n\n8.3.10 Market Preferences\nIn addition to public concerns and perceptions of UAM technologies and operations, we also probed market\npreferences. The survey questions explored the circumstances under which the public saw itself using\n\n67 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nUAM, how much they were willing to pay for the service, and perceptions toward ownership and vertiport\nusage. First, to investigate the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s preferences for UAM flight, we asked respondents a question\ndesigned to capture the tradeoff between cost and privacy. Respondents were asked whether they would\nbe willing to pay a premium fare to fly alone, without any other passengers. Across the survey sample, 14%\nof the respondents were willing to pay a premium fare, and approximately 33% were willing to consider a\npremium fare depending on the trip. Notably, 21% of the respondents were unwilling to pay the premium\nbecause they did not want to fly alone. For these passengers, other incentives could be considered when\ndesigning UAM experiences that charge premium fares. Comparing among the cities, respondents from\nLos Angeles valued their privacy most highly, with 22% willing to pay a premium fare to fly alone (Figure\n25).\n\nWould you pay a premium fare to fly alone, without any other passengers?\n40%\n\n30%\n\n30%\n20%\n\n33% 33%\n\n27% 24%\n\n32%\n24%\n\n22%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n12%\n\n10%\n\n3%\n\n18%\n4%\n\n3%\n\n0%\nHouston,\nN = 343\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area,\nN = 343\n\nLos Angeles,\nN = 344\n\nYes\n\nSometimes, it depends on the trip\n\nNo, I wouldn\'t be willing to pay\n\nNo, I wouldn\'t want to fly alone\n\nNo, for reasons other than listed above, please explain:\n40%\n\n35%\n\n30%\n20%\n10%\n\n34%\n\n28%\n21%\n\n12%\n5%\n\n28%\n\n33%\n\n22%\n14%\n\n11%\n\n28%\n\n21%\n\n5%\n\n4%\n\n0%\nWashington, D.C.,\nN = 343\n\nNew York City,\nN = 345\n\nYes\n\nSometimes, it depends on the trip\n\nNo, I wouldn\'t be willing to pay\n\nTotal,\nN = 1719\n\nNo, I wouldn\'t want to fly alone\n\nNo, for reasons other than listed above, please explain:\n\nFigure 25: Willingness to pay a premium fare to fly alone\nOverall, men were more willing to pay a premium fare to fly alone without any other passengers \xe2\x80\x93 the largest\ndiscrepancy between willingness to pay a premium to fly alone was due to reluctance among women to fly\nalone (27% of women were unwilling to fly vs. 13% among men). Household income did not appear to\nimpact a person\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to fly alone, but age had a significant impact. Older respondents were much\nless likely to pay a premium fare to fly alone (Figure 26).\n\n68 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nWould you pay a premium fare to fly alone, without any other passengers?\n50%\n40%\n\n18 - 24 years, N = 131\n\n30%\n\n25 - 34 years, N = 351\n\n20%\n\n35 - 44 years, N = 235\n\n45 - 54 years, N = 169\n\n10%\n\n55 - 64 years, N = 219\n\n0%\nYes\n\nSometimes, it No, I wouldn\'t be No, I wouldn\'t No, for reasons\ndepends on the willing to pay want to fly alone other than listed\ntrip\nabove, please\nexplain:\n\n65 - 74 years, N = 223\n75+ years, N = 61\n\nFigure 26: Willingness to pay a premium fare by age demographics\nNext, the survey explored the security preferences among the respondents. Most of the respondents preferred routine security screenings for UAM flight. Only 8% of the respondents were unwilling to undergo a\nsecurity screening process before each flight, and only 4% of the respondents did not want other passengers to undergo a security screening process. See Figure 84 in Appendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General\nPopulation Survey) for visual representation of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 security preferences. Respondents were\nalso probed for potential trip purposes of UAM. Similar to the findings from the focus groups, respondents\nwere most interested in using the technology for long-distance recreational trips (Figure 27).\n\nPlease select the trip purposes for which you would consider using an\nUrban Air Mobility aircraft. You may select more than one trip purpose.\n57%\n\n60%\n50%\n\n30%\n\n39%\n\n37%\n\n40%\n26%\n\n16%\n\n20%\n\n9%\n\n10%\n0%\n\nCommute\nUrban\nLong-distance\nto/from work or recreational trip recreational trip\nschool\n(e.g., a trip\n(e.g., a trip\nwithin a city) between cities)\n\nGo to/from\nhealthcare\nservices\n\nGo to/from the\nairport\n\nOther, please\nspecify:\n\nTotal, N = 1700\n\nFigure 27: Responses to UAM trip purpose\nFor each trip purpose that respondents would consider using a UAM aircraft, we asked them to specify who\nthey would likely travel with, if anyone (Figure 85 in Appendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General Population\nSurvey). Most of the respondents planned to fly with friends, a spouse/partner, or alone.\nRespondents were also asked a series of questions regarding their travel preferences in an automated\nfuture, where automated vehicles (AVs), shared automated vehicles (SAVs), and UAM are all present on\n\n69 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nthe market. Respondents were then asked questions regarding vertiports (specified landing/takeoff locations for UAM aircraft) and their use case preferences. For information on the survey findings from these\nquestions, please see Appendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General Population Survey).\nMany of the respondents (52% across the sample population) were not interested in owning a personal\nUAM aircraft, but 17% of respondents were interested in ownership. Men were more interested in owning\na UAM aircraft than women (21% and 13%, respectively). We also explored whether the supply of UAM\naircraft and pilots could be augmented through peer-to-peer (P2P) operations. For example, would owners\nof UAM aircraft be willing to rent out their aircraft or transport other people (similar to services, such as Lyft\nand Uber)? For those who answered \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x9d to the question of interest in owning\na personal UAM aircraft, there was high willingness to use the aircraft as part of a larger fleet service (e.g.,\nLyft, Uber). Approximately 44% of the sample respondents were willing to rent out their personal UAM\naircraft for use by others. Los Angeles had a particularly high willingness to participate in shared mobility\nservices \xe2\x80\x93 around 55% of those willing to own an aircraft were willing to also rent it out to others (i.e., a P2P\nservice model). This suggests that perhaps there may be opportunity for P2P operations with UAM aircraft.\nHowever, respondents were not as interested in fractional ownership (i.e., shared ownership of a UAM\namong individuals) with only 20% of the sample respondents indicating willingness to share ownership of\na UAM aircraft.\nIf P2P operations are to become a possibility, there will be a need for licensed pilots and people willing to\nfly UAM aircraft. The respondents were asked if they would be willing to fly a UAM aircraft, and approximately one in five respondents were willing. Los Angeles had an even higher percentage of respondents\nwho were willing to fly a UAM aircraft at 30%. However, the survey population was heavily skewed toward\nthose with pilot\xe2\x80\x99s licenses. Approximately one in five of the survey respondents claimed to possess a pilot\xe2\x80\x99s\nlicense, which is much higher than the national average. As of 2017, only 0.2% of U.S. residents were\nactive certified pilots (FAA, 2018).\n\n8.3.11 Perceptions from Non-User Perspective\nWe designed a set of questions that aimed to collect respondents\xe2\x80\x99 opinions from a non-user perspective.\nIn other words, how would people on the ground feel about UAM traffic overhead? Would there be pushback\nfrom those not planning to use technology? Respondents were asked how they perceived a UAM taxi flying\noverhead if it was piloted, remote piloted, and automated. For the latter two types of UAM taxi, respondents\nwere asked about flights overhead with and without flight attendants. Respondents tended to prefer flights\nthat were piloted or that had a flight attendant on board (Figure 28) as their presence made non-users feel\nsafer.\nTo gauge concern over noise, we probed the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 current experiences and perceptions about\nnoise. The most common bothersome noises experienced by the respondents were noise from motor vehicles and neighboring properties, and they tended to be most bothered by noise at home. Respondents\nwho reported being bothered by noise from aircraft tended to experience the most disturbance during the\nearly morning hours and at night. Overall, respondents preferred that UAM technology have no noticeable\nnoise. The noise levels of the technology could affect support for UAM.\n\n70 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nA piloted Urban Air Mobility taxi is flying over your city.

Initial reactions were clustered around excitement and happiness, neutrality, and skepticism. Overall, male respondents and young respondents tended to express more\nexcitement over the technology, and they were also more willing to fly in a UAM aircraft. Familiarity with the\nUAM concept was also a strong factor influencing willingness-to-fly and a participant\xe2\x80\x99s decision on whether\nto take a UAM trip, suggesting that public education will play an important role in introducing UAM as a new\ntravel mode.\nNot surprisingly, the characteristics of a UAM trip impacted a respondents\xe2\x80\x99 feelings toward UAM. Respondents were more comfortable and willing to fly with passengers they knew in contrast to flying alone or with\nstrangers. Willingness decreased with increasing levels of automation, and the presence of a flight attendant only slightly alleviated discomfort. The characteristics of the trip itself were also important. The\nrespondents visualized themselves using UAM for longer trips and traveling to the airport. Long distance\nrecreational trips were more popular than using a UAM for commuting.\nWhile most of the respondents were not interested in UAM aircraft ownership, approximately 17% of the\nrespondents expressed interest. In addition, almost half of the individuals attracted to ownership expressed\nsignificant levels of interest in placing their aircraft into a larger fleet service, opening the possibility for P2P\nUAM operations in the future.\nFor those on the ground, piloted UAM aircraft or automated/remotely piloted UAM aircraft with flight attendants on board were preferred for travel overhead. UAM will need to address concerns of trust, reliability,\nsafety, and other issues to gain acceptance from non-users. Our results also indicate that noise levels could\nimpact non-user support for UAM.\n\nKey\nFindings\n\nKey findings uncovered through the survey include:\nNeutral to positive reactions to the UAM concept. Men, younger respondents, and\nwealthier respondents tended to be more excited.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe results from the ordinal logistic model with the dependent variable willingness-tofly indicates age, gender, and familiarity with the UAM concept were the most significant characteristics affecting a person\xe2\x80\x99s stated willingness to fly. Younger, male respondents and those already familiar with UAM prior to the study were more willing\nto fly via UAM.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nResults from Stated Preference (SP) questions also indicate that age, gender, and\nfamiliarity with the concept of UAM were statistically significant predictors of whether\na person would take a UAM trip. These results are directionally the same as the ordinal model.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nResults from the SP survey questions indicate respondents with higher incomes\nwere more likely to take UAM trips.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n72 | P a g e\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNone of the metropolitan areas displayed significance in the willingness-to-fly model;\nhowever, in the model derived from the SP questions, the coefficients for Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area were statistically significant. Survey respondents\nfrom Los Angeles were more likely to agree to take a trip compared to respondents\nfrom Houston, and respondents from the San Francisco Bay Area were less likely to\nagree to take a UAM trip compared to respondents from Houston.\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRespondents most comfortable flying with passengers they know; least comfortable\nflying with passengers they don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSome willingness and apprehension about flying alone (particularly in an automated/remote piloted context).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStrong preference for piloted operations; may need to offer mixed fleets and/or a discount for remote piloted/automated operations to gain mainstream societal acceptance.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe presence of a flight attendant did not impact willingness to fly on an automated\nor remote piloted UAM aircraft.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFlight attendant did increase confidence in automated and remote piloted operations\nfrom the non-user perspective (someone on the ground).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPreference for longer inter-city flights (e.g., Washington, D.C. to Baltimore; LA to San\nDiego).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSurvey and focus groups suggest some resistance to very short trips due to cost,\nconvenience (e.g., required connections to/from vertiport; security screening; etc.).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSome desire among younger and male respondents to pay a premium to fly alone.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSome willingness to own and pilot UAM aircraft.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPotential for a market for P2P operations that could help provide additional supply to\nscale the market (similar to Lyft and Uber).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n73 | P a g e\n\nRespondents were more receptive to using UAM for travel to the airport or long-distance recreational trips than for commuting.\n\nExisting noise concerns focus on traffic noise during the night and early morning;\nnoise from UAM could pose a more notable obstacle in the future as electric vehicles\nbecome more mainstream (potentially causing a reduction in overall ambient noise\nmaking UAM more noticeable).\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n74 | P a g e\n\n21 November 2018\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n9.0\n\n21 November 2018\n\nWEATHER BARRIERS\n\nWeather constraints represent a critical and complex component of characterizing the UAM market.\nWeather can influence many components of UAM, including operations, service supply, passenger comfort,\ncommunity acceptance, infrastructure, and traffic management. In this study, our goal was to provide an\ninitial assessment of underlying historical weather conditions, or a climatology, which could impact UAM,\nwith a focus on operations. No assumptions were made regarding vehicles or technology, so results could\nbe made more precise by examining specific use cases in the future.\n\n9.1\n\nMethodology\n\nThis section will describe our weather analysis methodology used to develop the climatology, including data\nsources, generation of climatology at the ten focus urban areas, and consolidation of results into overall\nweather impacted hours.\n\n9.1.1\n\nWeather Data Sources\n\nWe first surveyed available data sources in and near focus urban areas, and found limited availability of\nhigh resolution, reliable (calibrated) observations collected directly in the urban areas. We therefore targeted regularly collected weather observations including Meteorological Aerodrome Report (METAR), vertical soundings, and pilot reports (PIREP) for our analysis. METAR are point observations collected hourly\nat the surface, most commonly at airports, and capture a wide range of conditions, including temperature,\nwind direction and speed, sky cover (low ceilings/visibility), and present weather (e.g., thunderstorms, rain,\nsnow). Vertical soundings are generated from weather balloons that are launched twice a day from a fixed\nlocation, in morning (12Z) and afternoon (00Z) and provide conditions aloft which would be experienced\nduring UAM flight or at an elevated vertiport. Data collected from these soundings include temperature,\npressure, dew point, and wind speed and direction at multiple altitudes from the surface to about 65,000 ft.\nPIREPs are generated whenever a pilot encounters weather conditions that they deem impactful, such as\nlow level wind shear or turbulence. These are not collected at a regular time interval, so they are used in\nthis analysis as a supplemental source of weather impacts to augment signals observed from the METAR\nand vertical soundings.\n\nFigure 29: Surface and vertical sounding observation locations for 6 of the 10 target urban areas.\nColor shading area indicates spatial coverage of urban areas according to the U.S. Census\nWe evaluated the spatial extent and distribution of observation locations relative to the focus urban areas\nto assess how representative these data are of conditions and variability within the urban area. The METAR\nsurface and vertical sounding observation locations overlap well with several of the target urban areas, but\nmay not be fully representative of conditions in many. In most of the Eastern and Texas target urban areas,\nthese observation locations are distributed evenly across the region while in some locations such as Miami\n\n75 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nand Houston, the observations only capture conditions in one portion of the region (Figure 29 above). Furthermore, in some focus urban areas such as Denver, vertical sounding observations are collected outside\nof the urban area and may not fully represent conditions within the urban area. Despite these limitations,\nthese observations provide a valuable baseline on historical adverse conditions in the target urban areas\nfrom which weather barriers to UAM can be assessed.\n\n9.1.2\n\nHistorical Statistics\n\nWeather conditions potentially impactful to UAM operations can vary strongly both diurnally and seasonally\nin many of our target urban areas, so we stratified our climatology by hour of the day and meteorological\nseason \xe2\x80\x93 Winter (Dec, Jan, Feb), Spring (Mar, Apr, May), Summer (Jun, Jul, Aug), and Fall (Sep, Oct, Nov).\nWe focused our analysis on the anticipated UAM operational window of 7 am \xe2\x80\x93 6 pm Local Time to align\nwith our economic market analysis, but have data for all 24 hours of the day.\nFor METAR surface observations, we computed statistics over a 7-year historical period (2010-2017) such\nas average temperature and frequency of conditions such as thunderstorms and Instrument Flight Rules\n(IFR) for each hour of the UAM operational window and each season. These statistics were first calculated\nand evaluated at each METAR location for an urban area to enable assessment of variability in adverse\nconditions at different locations within the urban area. For example, we found a significant difference in the\nfrequency of winds greater than 20 kts in the San Francisco urban area during summer in the afternoon,\nwith frequency greater than 50% at SFO (west of the Bay) but under 5% at OAK (east of the Bay) around\n4 pm Local Time. This indicates that during this time and season, wind conditions are much more favorable\nfor UAM operations in the eastern urban area than the western portion. We then calculated these statistics\nacross all METAR stations in aggregate to analyze the seasonal variability in conditions across the urban\narea. Continuing the San Francisco example, we found that in aggregate, the frequency of winds greater\nthan 20 kts is greatest (~20%) during afternoon in most seasons but only about 10% during winter indicating\nthat across the urban area, wind conditions are slightly more favorable for UAM operations in winter.\nAs indicated earlier, the vertical sounding observations are only collected twice a day, so we computed\nseasonal averages across a 5-year historical period (2013-2017) for each of these two times (12Z and 00Z)\nat all target urban areas. Observations are collected at irregular vertical intervals as the balloon ascends,\nso we calculated average conditions in 500 ft bins to ensure sufficient sample size. Density altitude was\ncomputed from seasonal average conditions in the lowest available vertical bin at all urban areas to\ncharacterize lift conditions at vertiports. Average winds were generated by calculating the average NorthSouth and East-West wind vector components of all historical winds in each altitude bin.\n\nFigure 30: Distribution of PIREPs by weather condition at focus urban areas. No PIREPs were generated across our historical period in Honolulu\nPilot reports were used as supplemental observations to augment results from the surface and vertical\nsounding observations due to their ad hoc collection. We first isolated PIREPs across a 3-year historical\nperiod (2015-2017) over or near the focus urban areas using the airport code in the reports. Within each\nurban area, we then computed the percentage of reports with each type of reported weather to identify\nwhich conditions were most prevalent (Figure 30 above). Across all urban areas, low ceilings and\n\n76 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nturbulence were the most frequently reported conditions with low level wind shear being reported somewhat\nfrequently at several urban areas including Denver and San Francisco. Because more than one condition\nmay be included in a given report, these percentages may not always add up to 100%.\n\n9.1.3\n\nImpacted Hours\n\nAfter generating detailed statistics on historical weather conditions individually, we lastly computed the\noverall average number of hours that UAM operations would potentially be significantly impacted based on\nthe underlying conditions. The goal of capturing these impacted hours is to provide a consolidated metric\nfor weather impacts during the UAM operational day at each urban area. The impacted hours were\ngenerated based on METAR surface observations as they provide the highest temporal resolution (hourly)\nof all our data sources.\nTo do this, we first defined \xe2\x80\x9cimpact scores\xe2\x80\x9d for each weather condition captured in METAR observations,\nfrom 1 (minimally impactful, little reduction in operations) to 10 (significantly impactful, potential cessation\nof operations). We leveraged our extensive expertise in aviation weather as well as available literature on\nweather influence on UAS and UAM vehicles to define these scores which are shown in Table 10. These\nscores are preliminary and were defined to capture potential impacts across a wide range of UAM\noperations and make no assumptions about components such as vehicle type or level of automation.\nFurther refinement and precision of the weather impact scores could be achieved through case studies\nwhere these components are explicitly defined. Vertical wind shear is a critical condition that will likely\nimpact UAM operations which cannot be directly quantified from surface observations. These impact scores\ncould be extended by leveraging higher temporal resolution vertical data such as airborne observations\nfrom commercial aircraft.\nTable 10: Impact Scores for each weather condition from METAR\nWeather Condition\n\nScore\n\nWeather Condition\n\nScore\n\nDrizzle\n\n1\n\nWind 20 - 25 kts\n\n7\n\nRain\n\n1\n\nSmoke (<3 sm)\n\n7\n\nMVFR Ceiling\n\n1\n\nLIFR Ceiling\n\n7\n\nHaze\n\n1\n\nIFR Visibility\n\n7\n\nIce Crystals\n\n1\n\nWind \xe2\x89\xa5 25 kts\n\n8\n\nSand Whirls\n\n1\n\nSleet\n\n8\n\nSand\n\n2\n\nSqualls\n\n8\n\nSnow Grains\n\n2\n\nFog\n\n8.5\n\nTemp \xe2\x89\xa4 32\xc2\xb0F\n\n3\n\nFreezing Fog\n\n8.5\n\nTemp \xe2\x89\xa5 100\xc2\xb0F\n\n3\n\nFreezing Drizzle\n\n9\n\nIFR Ceiling\n\n4\n\nThunderstorms\n\n9\n\nDust\n\n5\n\nDust Storm\n\n10\n\nSnow\n\n5\n\nFunnel Cloud/Tornado\n\n10\n\nSandstorm\n\n5\n\nFreezing Rain\n\n10\n\nWind 15 - 20 kts\n\n5\n\nHail\n\n10\n\nMist (vis >= 5/8 sm)\n\n6\n\nVolcanic Ash\n\n10\n\nSnow Pellets\n\n6\n\n77 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nWe then computed the average impact score at each hour of the UAM operational day for each season at\nall target urban areas, based on conditions that occurred historically during that hour. To define an hour of\nthe UAM operational day as \xe2\x80\x9cimpacted\xe2\x80\x9d, we needed to define an average impact score threshold. We evaluated variability of the average impact score distributions, as well as the impact scores themselves, and\ndetermined that an average impact score threshold of 3 provided a robust delineation between minimal and\nsignificant potential impacts to UAM operations. This threshold could be further refined with additional analysis, and also through application of specific assumptions about UAM operations (e.g., vehicle type). Therefore, if the average impact score for any hour of any season exceeded 3, we considered that hour to be\npotentially impacted by weather, or an \xe2\x80\x9cimpacted hour\xe2\x80\x9d. The number of impacted hours was lastly summed\nacross the UAM operational day for each season. For example, the average impact score during summer\nat San Francisco exceeded 3 from 1-6 pm Local Time, leading to a total of 6 weather impacted hours\n(Figure 31).\n\nFigure 31: Average impact scores for each hour of UAM operational day at San Francisco urban\narea in summer\n\n78 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n9.2\n\n21 November 2018\n\nResults\n\nThis section will describe our results, focusing on key signals including high historical frequency of\npotentially impactful weather conditions, variability in conditions within an urban area as well as diurnally\nand seasonally, and average number of impacted hours. Because the sample size of historical PIREPs\nwas not sufficient to evaluate seasonal or diurnal variability in conditions, we evaluated the spatial\ndistribution of reported conditions in each urban area to augment signals observed from surface and vertical\nsoundings. Results will be presented for urban area regions first, followed by density altitude across all\nurban areas, and lastly impacted hours. Supplemental figures to augment results presented here can be\nfound in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather Analysis.\n\n9.2.1\n\nWestern Urban Areas\n\nOverall, weather conditions are favorable for UAM operations at most western focus urban areas. In\nHonolulu, surface winds above 20 kts are the only potentially impactful condition with a relatively high\nfrequency of occurrence (9-10%) in early afternoon during spring and summer (Figure 91 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93\nWeather Analysis). Phoenix experiences several weather conditions on average that may be impactful to\nUAM, including high temperatures, strong winds, and thunderstorms (Figure 92 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather\nAnalysis). These unfavorable conditions\noccur most frequently during afternoon in\nsummer. Most pilot reports in Phoenix\nwere due to turbulence and were uniformly\ndistributed spatially across the urban area.\nIn the Los Angeles urban area, weather\nconditions are mostly favorable for UAM\noperations, though IFR conditions are\nsomewhat frequent in morning, especially\nduring summer (Figure 93 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93\nWeather Analysis). There was also\nvariability within urban area during\nsummer, where historical IFR frequency\nwas above 50% in early morning at LAX\nwhile only about 20% at Van Nuys (Figure\n32). Most PIREPs were due to turbulence,\nlocated mostly over the ocean, and low\nceilings, located mostly in the western Figure 32: Hourly summer frequency of IFR conditions at\nLAX (orange) and VNY (blue) in Los Angles urban area\nurban area which is consistent with\nfindings from METAR observations.\nWe also found variability in conditions within the San Francisco urban area, which frequently experiences\nIFR and winds above 20 kts in most seasons (Figure 94 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather Analysis). The frequency of winds above 20 kts is significantly greater\nat SFO than OAK in all seasons except for winter\n(Figure 33). This suggests that wind conditions are\nmore favorable for UAM in the eastern portion of the\nurban area during afternoon hours. IFR conditions\nalso have a high historical frequency during morning\nhours, exceeding 60% before 8 am Local Time in\nsummer.\nIn Denver, average weather conditions are unfavorable for UAM operations during most hours and seasons (Figure 95 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather Analysis). Cold temperatures (below freezing) which may\nreduce passenger comfort and influence vehicle\nbattery life are possible during fall, winter, and spring\nespecially in the morning hours. IFR conditions are\n\n79 | P a g e\n\nFigure 33: Hourly summer frequency of winds\nabove 20 kts at SFO (orange) and OAK (green)\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nalso somewhat frequent (15%) during the morning across all seasons, with lowest frequency occurring\nduring summer. Thunderstorms and strong winds are common during afternoon in summer, which could\ncompromise safety of UAM operations. Strong average winds aloft (5000 ft) were also observed during all\nseasons on average, which could influence UAM mission duration and vehicle spacing (for large scale\noperations). Denver is also one of the few focus urban areas where PIREPs were generated for all types\nof weather conditions (Figure 96 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather Analysis). Turbulence and wind shear were\nthe most frequently reported conditions and were distributed uniformly across the urban area spatially.\n\n9.2.2\n\nEastern Urban Areas\n\nAverage weather conditions were found to be less favorable in the Eastern focus urban areas than the\nWestern areas. In Washington, D.C., thunderstorms and IFR conditions are the most frequent potentially\nimpactful weather. IFR conditions are on average most common in the early morning during all seasons\nwhile thunderstorms occurred most often in afternoon during summer (Figure 97 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather\nAnalysis). Most PIREPs were due to turbulence and low ceilings, the majority of which were reported while\ndeparting out of IAD in the western portion of the urban area (Figure 98 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather Analysis).\nSeveral adverse conditions were frequent in the New York urban area for most hours and seasons, which\nincluded IFR, winds above 20 kts, and rapid changes in wind speed with altitude, or vertical wind shear\n(Figure 99 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather Analysis). Variability in strong winds was observed within the urban\narea, with JFK (on Long Island in eastern portion of the urban area) experiencing the highest frequency of\nwinds above 20 kts during afternoon (~14%) while a significantly lower frequency of occurrence (~2%) was\nobserved at TEB (northern portion of urban area). Across the urban area in aggregate, IFR conditions are\nfrequent (20-25%) during all seasons in early morning. Wind shear was also observed during morning in\nwinter, with average wind speed increasing from only a few knots at the surface to almost 20 kts around\n1000 ft altitude which could impact UAM during takeoff and in flight. Similar to Washington, D.C., most\nPIREPs in the New York urban area indicated turbulence and low ceilings (Figure 100 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93\nWeather Analysis).\nOverall, average weather conditions in the Miami urban area were favorable for UAM operations.\nThunderstorms occurred frequently during early afternoon in summer and fall, while IFR conditions were\nsomewhat common during winter in the early morning hours (Figure 101 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather Analysis).\n\n9.2.3\n\nTexas Urban Areas\n\nIn the two Texas urban areas, frequent thunderstorms, IFR, and vertical wind shear conditions pose\npotential challenges for UAM operations in most seasons. In Houston, we found some variability in IFR\ncondition frequency within the urban area (Figure 102 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather Analysis). These conditions\nare most frequent during morning in winter and spring overall, but have a higher frequency at IAH (over\n35%), in the northern part of the urban area, than at HOU (20%) which is in the southern portion of the\nurban area. High surface air temperatures, which may impact passenger comfort, are possible in summer\nand early fall. Thunderstorms were also frequent in early afternoon during summer, which would impact\nsafety of UAM operations. We also saw that a strong low level jet, or altitude band with strong winds, was\ncommonly present around 2500 ft in morning during winter along with strong winds near 5000 ft.\nAverage weather in the Dallas urban area was similar to Houston, with high temperature, IFR,\nthunderstorms, and strong low level jet being the most frequent potentially impactful conditions to UAM\n(Figure 104 in Appendix 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Weather Analysis). The frequency of IFR conditions during morning in fall and\nsummer was higher in Dallas than Houston, but still less frequent than in winter and spring. We also found\nthat thunderstorms were more common during afternoon in spring than in Houston, possibly due to passage\nof strong cold fronts that are frequent during spring.\n\n9.2.4\n\nDensity Altitude\n\nThe average density altitude for all target urban areas in each season, calculated from conditions in the\nlowest altitude bin of the vertical sounding data, is shown in Table 11 along with the field elevation from\nwhich the observations were taken. These values are greatest for all urban areas during summer, when\ntemperature is typically highest.

These\nweather impacted hours are shown in Table 12, along with the average across all seasons in the rightmost\ncolumn. According to the average values across the seasons, approximately half of the UAM operational\nday would potentially be impacted by weather on average at most target urban areas including New York,\nWashington, D.C., Dallas, Houston, Denver, and Honolulu.\nWe found a high number of weather impacted hours, sometimes more than half of the UAM operational\nday, occurred during winter and spring in the Northeast, Texas, and Denver urban areas. Conversely, most\nurban areas experienced the fewest impacted hours during summer and fall with the exceptions being\nHonolulu and Phoenix. Due to the high frequency of several impactful conditions during summer in Phoenix,\nincluding thunderstorms and high temperatures, almost half of the operational day would potentially be\ninfluenced by adverse weather during summer. In Honolulu, the high frequency of strong winds through\nmost of the operational day during summer results in nine weather impacted hours during summer.\nDespite historical occurrence of adverse conditions like thunderstorms, the number of weather impacted\nhours in Miami was zero for all seasons. This is due to the fact that the underlying frequency of thunderstorms was sufficiently low that the average impact scores for all hours of the UAM operational day fell\nbelow our threshold of 3. These results would benefit from refinement of our impact scores to capture the\nfact that underlying frequency of occurrence is different for all phenomena, with smaller values expected\nfor small scale, short-lived conditions like thunderstorms.\n\n81 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nTable 12: Average number of weather impacted hours for all target urban areas by season\nUrban Areas\n\nSpring\n\nSummer\n\nFall\n\nAverage\n\nNew York\n\n12\n\n12\n\n0\n\n8\n\n8\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n12\n\n12\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\nMiami\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nDallas\n\n11\n\n12\n\n3\n\n0\n\n6.5\n\nHouston\n\n9\n\n11\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\nDenver\n\n12\n\n12\n\n4\n\n3\n\n7.75\n\nPhoenix\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n1.25\n\nLos Angeles\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nSan\nFrancisco\n\n3\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4.75\n\nHonolulu\n\n0\n\n7\n\n9\n\n6\n\n5.5\n\nAverage\n\n9.3\n\nWinter\n\n6.1\n\n7.3\n\n2.9\n\n2.2\n\nWeather Barriers Summary\n\nKey\nFindings\n\nWe found the following key results from the weather barriers analysis:\nWeather most favorable for UAM operations in Western focus urban areas,\nwhich experience weather impacted hours for less than half of the operational\nwindow mostly due to frequent high temperatures and IFR conditions during\nsummer and strong surface winds\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWeather conditions highly unfavorable for UAM operations in Denver due to frequent adverse weather in all seasons\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nApproximately half of the UAM operational day potentially impacted by weather\non average in Texas urban areas due to thunderstorms, IFR conditions, and\nvertical wind shear\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWeather conditions less favorable in New York and Washington, D.C. focus urban areas as potential for most of operational day to be impacted by weather\non average across all seasons primarily due to IFR conditions, strong surface\nwinds, and vertical wind shear\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n82 | P a g e\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWeather favorable for UAM operations in Miami, though thunderstorms could\ncause short term disruptions mostly in fall and summer\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n83 | P a g e\n\n21 November 2018\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\n10.0 AIRPORT SHUTTLE AND AIR TAXI MARKET ANALYSIS\nThe Booz Allen team approached the analysis of Airport Shuttle and Air Taxi markets using a system-ofsystem framework. As shown in Figure 34, the UAM ecosystem can be conceptualized as a set of system\nlevel layers including: supply (in terms of technology and UAM transport services), demand for UAM services, infrastructure (in terms of location and capacity of vertiports), legal/regulatory environment, and the\ngeneral public. Each system layer and connections between them are investigated using a scenario and\nMonte Carlo based sensitivity analyses framework. For the purpose of this study, we calculated and tracked\nkey metrics from the perspective of operators (e.g., number of flights, potential revenue and operating\ncosts), passengers (e.g., number and distribution), non-flying public (e.g., flight patterns, potential noise\nimpacts), and infrastructure providers (e.g., number, location and capacity of vertiports).\nFigure 34 shows the block diagram describing the multi-step process used to analyze the UAM markets.\nThis included:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStep 1: Definition of concept of operations (ConOps): An air taxi mission is defined based on\nrequirements in terms of mission range, demand, infrastructure availability, and vehicle capabilities,\namong others. A concept of operations (ConOps) was also designed to capture the activities completed by the passenger and air taxi to complete one mission. The ConOps included ground transportation for first last mile service, transfers, and air taxi flight.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStep 2: Development of operating model and calculation of key performance metrics: Cost\nof service for passengers was calculated for different vehicle type proposed to serve the Air Taxi\nmarket. Each relevant cost component like capital and maintenance cost, energy and battery cost,\nand infrastructure cost, among others were individually modeled. Weather related adjustments like\nwind speed, temperature, and density for each urban area was applied. Having calculated the cost\nof service for passengers, the next step in the loop was to calculate demand using a five-step\nprocess: Trip Generation, Scoping, Trip Distribution, Mode Choice, and Operational constraints.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStep 3: What if Scenario Analyses: As described in the introduction to this section, the UAM\nmarket is at the initial stage of development and its emergence will be driven by several factors.\nThe potential effects of a several factors were tested to understand the implications to market size\nand viability. These included: operational constraints including capacity of available infrastructure,\ntime of day restrictions on operations to minimize impact on public, and regulatory hurdles to fly\nunder Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) conditions.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStep 4: Monte Carlo based Sensitivity analyses: In order to assess the propagation of input\nuncertainties on key performance metrics to better understand the potential market size and its\nviability, Monte Carlo based sensitivity analyses were conducted. This involved randomly generating 10,000 missions for each urban area. Eight scenarios were developed based on current state\nand future state of air taxi system of systems and decisions and actions by key stakeholders.\n\n10.1\n\nDesign Mission and ConOps\n\nAs input to the system level analysis of the UAM market, operational concepts and typical missions were\ndeveloped. Figure 35 shows a step-by-step notional ConOps as defined in this analysis. In comparison to\nthe same trip performed by ride-hailing service on ground, passengers using UAM service (i.e., air taxi or\nairport shuttle) undergo the following transfers: Origin to Heliport (or Vertiport) using ground transportation,\nHeliport (closer to the origin) to Heliport (closer to the destination), and Heliport to Destination using ground\ntransportation.\n\n84 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nModeling Framework\n\nAnalysis Framework\n\nNoise\nPopulation\nExposure\n\nTrip Generation\n\nTrip\nDistribution\n\nMode-Choice\n(Market Size)\n\nSupply\n(operator)\n\nAircraft\nClassification\n\nDirect\nOperating Cost\n\nIndirect\nOperating Cost\n\nNoise around\nvertiport\n\nCost vs time\nsavings\n\nPublic\n\nEmissions\n\nNumber of\nPassengers\n\nEmissions\n\nDemand\nfor UAT services\n\nUAM System of Systems\n\nPublic\n\nResults (by stakeholders)\n\nPassengers\n\nScenario-based\nAnalyses\n\nPrice per\npassenger mile\n\n5%\n\nOperators\n\n4%\n\n3%\n\nFleet\n100%\n\n75%\n\n50%\n\n2%\n\n25%\n1%\n\n53%\n\nPhoenix\n\nG R O U N D I N F R A S T R U N T U RC OC O N SO N S T N A DN E D\nC OT E ST C TRAI R EI\n\n34%\n\nGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINED\n\nOutput\n\nState / Local\n\nIterative Loop\n\nFigure 34: Modeling framework for Airport Shuttle and Air Taxi Analysis\n\n85 | P a g e\n\n5%\n\n3%\n\n2%\n\n0.2%\n\n5%\n\n8.6%\n\n11%\n4%\n\n9.0%\n\nA T M C A P A C I T Y C OO S T R A I N S T R A I N E D\nCN\nCO ED\n\n2%\n\n14%\n\n19%\n3%\n\n0.2%\n\n5%\n\n2%\n\n5%\n\n8.6%\n\n11%\n\n18%\n\n19%\n\n18%\n\n14%\n\nCOST CONSTRAINED\n\nNew York\nSan Francisco\n\n34%\n\n34%\n\nNew York\n\nKey Steps\nFederal\n\ni\n\nx\n\ner\n\nni\n\nHouston\n\nPhoenix\n\n50%\n\nDenver\n\nHouston\n\nProcess\nLegal / Regulatory\nEnvironment\n\nHaw\nai\n\ngt\non\xe2\x80\xa6\n\noe\n\n13\n\nDe\nnv\n\n12\n\nPh\n\ni\n\nsto\nn\n\nci sc\no\n\nHou\n\nFr\nan\n\nSa\nn\n\nW\nas\nhin\n\nrk\n\nes\n\nlas\n\nYo\n\nM\niam\n\n11\n\nSan Francisco\n\n9.0%\n\nNOT COST CONSTRAINED\n\n10\n\nDenver\n\n50%\n\n53%\n\n50%\n\nInfrastructure\nProviders\n\n9\n\nUse/Capacity\nConstraints\n\n66%\n\nVertiports Use\n& Distribution\n\nDal\n\n8\n\nOperating Cost per passenger mile\n\nng\nel\n\n7\n\nsA\n\n6\n\nNew\n\n5\n\nLo\n\n4\n\n61%\n\n66%\n61%\n\nAir Traffic\nManagement\n\n3\n\n4%\n\nGround\nInfrastructure\n\nMonte Carlo\nbased\nSensitivity\nAnalyses\n\n2\n\n2%\n\nInfrastructure\nCapacity Constraints\n\nExisting\nHeliports\n\nNew\nInfrastructure\n50%\n\nAirports/Vertiports\n(number & location)\n\n1\n\n34%\n\nInfrastructure\n\n0%\n\nExisting\nAirports (small\nor large)\n\n0%\n\nATM CAPACITY CONSTRAINED\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nTrip using UAM Service\n\nHELIPORT\n\nTime (minutes)\n\ne\ng Rid\nusin\nTrip g Service\nin\nHail\n\nnd\n: Grou\nStep 9 rtation to\no\nTransp on\nti\na\nDestin\n\nTime\nSavings\n\nStep 8: Disembarkation\nStep 7: Descent\n\nStep 6:Cruise Time\nStep 5: Climb\n\nnd\nr Grou\nken fo ort\nTime ta\nelip\ntep 3: ation to H\nS\nort\nTransp\n\nTrip using UAM service\n\nStep 4: Customer wait time\nfor air taxi + Embarkation\n\nTrip using Ride Hailing service\n\nDistance (miles)\n\nStep 2: Customer wait time for ground transportation\nStep 1: Customer makes a trip request\n\nFigure 35: Notional ConOps for Air Taxi and Airport Shuttle mission\nAs shown on Figure 36, a typical Airport Shuttle and Air Taxi mission comprises five main phases of flight:\ntake-off, climb, cruise, descent, and landing.

An\nadditional transition phase (vertical to horizontal flight) is added between take-off and climb phase for tilt\nrotor, tilt wing, and tilt duct type of aircraft. There is no horizontal movement considered during the transition\nphase. In this study, reserve mission kicks off during the descent phase and follows a similar profile as\noriginal mission i.e., take-off, climb, cruise (at cruise altitude and cruise speed), descent, and landing at\nanother landing area (l2\xe2\x80\x99).\nMission Distance\n\nReserve Mission\n\nCruise\n\nCruise\n\nClimb\n\nDescent\n\nTransition\nPhase\n\nh3\n\nTake-off\n\nTransition\nPhase\n\nTaxiTO\nh1, I1\n\nGround\n\nClimb\n\nDescent\n\nTake-off\n\nLanding\nTaxiL\n\nTransition Phase\n\nh3\n\nh2, I2\n\nTaxi: Preparation time to lift off once the passengers are on-board\nTake-off: Climb vertically at hover power (no horizontal movement)\n\nLanding\nTaxiL\n\nh2\xe2\x80\x99, I2\xe2\x80\x99\n\nwhere,\n\nClimb: Climb to cruise altitude\nCruise: Flight phase that occurs when the aircraft levels after a climb to a cruise altitude and before it begins to descend\n\nh1: Height of take-off Site I1\nh2: Height of landing Site I2\nh3: Cruise Height\nh2\': Height of landing Site I2\xe2\x80\x98\n\nDescent: Aircraft begins approach to final landing.

Among other\nassumptions highlighted in Table 13 below for the Monte Carlo analysis, we expected Air Taxis and Airport\nShuttle to serve a longest mission of 50 miles with a single charge.\n\n86 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nTable 13: Operations Related Assumptions for Monte-Carlo (first few years of service)\nParameter\nDefinition\nMinimum Maximum\nAircraft Seats\n\nNumber of seats in aircraft.

For example, Tilt Ducts have significantly higher\ndisk loading (i.e., higher engine power will be required to hover while Multirotor has significantly low lift to\ndrag ratio indicating lower performance). For the purpose of this analysis, the airport shuttle and air taxi\nmarkets were evaluated using electric vehicles/technology due to potentially lower environmental impact,\nlower dependence on fluctuating fuel prices, and lower operating costs. Therefore, we focused our supply\nside analysis on the electric version of the mentioned vehicle types (Autogyro and Coaxial Rotor were not\nconsidered due to unavailability of sufficient data) and refer to them as electric VTOL (eVTOL). Next, we\nreviewed 70+ designs from the publicly available sources and developed technical specifications like speed,\nrange, and weight, among others of reference vehicle for each of the remaining vehicle types as shown in\nFigure 37. Aircraft specifications like vehicle cost and maximum take-off weight (MTOW) were calculated\non per seat basis and were simply extrapolated for aircraft with more than one seat.\nHaving developed reference vehicles for each vehicle type, the next step was to operate these vehicles on\na randomly generated design mission. We followed a ride-sharing business model (i.e., one or more passenger travels in an eVTOL and pays on a per passenger mile basis). All passengers are picked up at the\norigin vertiport and are dropped-off at the destination vertiport. Ground transportation further provides first\nand/or last mile service.\nEconomic\nModel\nAircraft\nClassification\n\nOperating cost\n\nAssumptions\nMultirotor\n\nDirect operating cost\n\nEnergy Costs\nBattery Reserve\nCrew Cost and\nTraining\nMaintenance Cost\nInsurance\n\nReservation\nCost\n\nIndirect operating cost\n\nCapital Cost\n\nLanding Fees/\nInfrastructure\n\nUtilization\n\nTilt Duct\n\nTicketing Costs\nCredit Card\nProcessing\nFees\n\nLoad Factor\n\nLift and Cruise\n\nTilt Rotor\n\nMonte Carlo\nAnalysis\n\nRange\n\n1-5 Seat Arrangement\n\nCruise Speed\n\nTilt Wing\n\nBattery Power\n\nCompound\nHelicopter\n\nMarketing\n\nDeadend Trips\nFactor\n\nBuilding\nHangar\n\nRoute Cost\n\nProcess\nOutput/Note\n\nKey Steps\n\nDemand\nModel\nOperating Cost\nper passenger\nmile\n\n1 Maximum\n2 Landing\n\nFeedback\n\nPricing\nModel\n\n$ per passenger mile\n\nTaxes\n\nFigure 38: Structure of Supply Economic Model for an eVTOL\n\n89 | P a g e\n\nTake-Off Weight\nTake-Off Weight\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nNext, the operating cost per passenger mile for each reference vehicle was calculated as a sum of direct\noperating cost (DOC) and indirect operating cost (IOC). DOC includes capital, energy, battery, crew,\nmaintenance, insurance, infrastructure, and route cost, while IOC includes marketing and reservation costs.\nNext, we applied a pricing model and taxes to calculate price per passenger mile (i.e., cost to passenger).\nEach of the cost components of DOC were individually modeled for aircraft with 2-5 seats (1-seat aircraft\nwas not considered due to pilot requirement), while IOC was calculated as percent of DOC (10-30%). To\nconduct the Monte Carlo based sensitivity analysis, 10,000 randomly generated iterations were performed.\nTable 14 shows key steps and the uncertainty ranges and assumptions used in modeling of each of the\ncost component.

For this analysis, we used cost plus profit pricing strategy for the operators with an assumed profit margin of 10-30%.\nFinally, we assumed that the Air taxis and Airport Shuttle services will be subjected to taxes and fees like\non demand taxis or ride sharing services. These taxes can range from sales tax, commercial motor tax,\nworkers compensation fund, surcharge for public transportation, surcharge for accessibility, licensing fees,\nrecall charges, inspection fees, environment tax, and local/state property tax. Each of these tax components\ndepends on location and we assumed a unified tax rate of 5-15%.\nWe observed that a 5-Seat eVTOL is expected to cost around $6.25 per passenger mile in the near term\nwith an uncertainty of +/-50%, which was lower than current operated helicopters66 but higher than all the\nground services.

For this step the model was calibrated using the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) data that\ndefines trips in two categories: mandatory trips (e.g., work trips) and discretional trips (e.g., shopping, entertainment, dinner, etc.). For air taxi market, works trips were generated using American Community Survey (ACS) commuting data shown in Figure 44 (5-year estimates, 2016) and discretional trips were generated using 2017\xe2\x80\x99s National Travel Household Survey (NTHS) data. For trips to or from U.S. airports, the\nU.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) T-100 Market (All Carriers) 2018 data was used. Airport\nspecific trips were generated by proportionally distributing daily demand from each airport in an urban area\nto each census tract based on its population.\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nStep 2: Trip Scoping \xe2\x80\x93 ACS datasets were available at different geographic levels (in the decreasing order\nof resolution), block groups, census tracts, place, county, and urban area for different mode types as shown\nin Figure 45. Temporal resolution of the datasets was limited to an average day of year (i.e., each weekday\nin a year was considered same). The team first chose few small urban areas like Phoenix, Denver, Miami,\nDallas, and performed tradeoff analysis between fidelity in results and computational speed for different\ncombinations of geographic levels and mode types. The analysis was then conducted at a census tract\nlevel for mode types classified as driving, ride-sharing, taxi, public transportation, and walking to achieve\noptimum fidelity in results and computational speed.\nDimension\nGeography\n\nLowest Resolution\nUrban Area\n\nCounty\n\nMode Type\n\nAll modes are\nconsidered same\n\nTemporal\n\nAverage Day of Year\n(i.e. each weekday in a\nyear is same)\n\nHighest Resolution\nCensus Tract\n\nPlace\n\nClassified as Driving,\nRide-sharing, Taxi, Public\nTransportation and\nWalking\n\nSeasonal Average day\n(i.e. define seasons,\neach weekday in a\nseason is same)\n\nMonthly Average\nday (i.e. each\nweekday in a\nmonth is same)\n\nBlock Group\n\nDriving \xe2\x80\x93 Drove alone (Car/Truck), carpooled\nwith 2, 3 or 4 passengers)\nPublic Transportation \xe2\x80\x93 Bus, Train, Boat etc.\nOthers - Motor Bike, Bicycle etc.\nRide-Sharing\nTaxi\nWalking\nWeekly Average\nday (i.e. each\nweekday in a\nweek is same)\n\nDaily (i.e.\ntreat each\nweekday as\nunique)\n\nHourly (i.e.\ntreat each hour\nof weekday as\nunique)\n\nSlowest computational speed\nFastest computational speed\nFigure 45: Tradeoff between fidelity in results and computational speed\n\nNext, existing infrastructure (i.e., helipads, referred to as vertiports in the study) and airports (small or big)\nobtained from Federal Aviation Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FAA) Aviation Environment Design Tool (AEDT) database\nwere used for first few years of operations. This assumed that no new vertiports would be constructed\nbefore the UAM market emerges. The effect of capacity enhancements in the form of additional vertiports\nand increased capacity per vertiports were evaluated in the Monte Carlo based sensitivity analyses. Each\ninfrastructure was assigned to each tract using a nearest neighbor algorithm. No two infrastructure were\nassigned to the same tract.\nIn parallel, for airport specific trips, due to technical feasibility and travel characteristics limitations, not all\npassengers arriving or departing at a major airport were expected to be potential customers of Airport Shuttle service. For example, it was considered unrealistic for a family of four traveling long distance with over\n200 lbs. of baggage (due to vehicle performance limitations). Therefore, the demand was scoped to focus\nthe airport shuttle analysis on 1 to 3 passengers per air ticket.\nStep 3: Trip Distribution \xe2\x80\x93 Trips were distributed between census tracts (origin-destination pairs) using a\nsimplified gravity model assuming equal likelihood of individual trip interchanges between the tracts. All the\ntrips where UAM total travel time was more than the travel time for ground transportation were removed\nfrom further analysis.\nStep 4: Mode Choice \xe2\x80\x93 Mode Choice Modeling was used to predict traveler mode choice while completing\na certain trip. Air Taxi and Airport Shuttle service was made to compete with personal cars, taxi, ride-hailing\nservice, and public transportation, among others. Next, a utility function was developed based on two key\nattributes that influence choice of mode, travel time, and travel cost per median household income per hour.\nCoefficients of the utility function was calibrated by fitting a logit model to the training data generated using\nthe 2016 American Community Survey and General Population Survey described in societal barriers section.\n\n94 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nHaving calibrated the utility function, a probabilistic choice model, Multinomial Logit Model (MNL), was selected to describe preferences and choice of a user in terms of probabilities of choosing each alternative\nrather than predicting that an individual will choose a particular mode with certainty.\nStep 5: Constraints \xe2\x80\x93 As a final step, demand generated in Step 4 was constrained by passenger\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to pay, infrastructure availability and capacity, time of day and visual flight rules operation restrictions. These constraints were applied sequentially as shown in Figure 46. See Appendix 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Market\nAnalysis for more details in each constraint application.\n\nUnconstrained\nScenario\n\nRefers to the best case scenario where infrastructure to take-off and land is\navailable at every census tract and is not constrained by capacity; operations\nare unaffected by weather and can be conducted 24/7. Finally, demand was\nnot constrained by willingness to pay (WTP) i.e., some passengers might still\nchose UAM service if the cost of service is more than WTP\n\nWillingness to Pay\n(WTP) Constraint\n\nWillingness to pay was calculated as passengers willingness to spend more\nbased on travel time savings. This constraint restricts demand for cases\nwhere cost of UAM service was more than passengers WTP\n\nInfrastructure\nConstraint Scenario\n\nThis scenario utilized existing infrastructure in the form of heliports and\nairports (assuming only one landing take-off pad)\n\nInfrastructure Capacity\nConstraint\n\nRefers to the demand reduction due to existing infrastructure\xe2\x80\x99s operational\ncapacity on per hour basis\n\nTime of Day Constraint\n\nDemand reduction due to operations in specific time of day i.e. 7am-6pm\nthat covers 80% of the demand and also has minimal impact on public (e.g.\ndue to noise pollution)\n\nWeather Constraint\n\nInitial operations were expected to be under Visual Flight Rules (VFR)\nconditions\nFigure 46: Step-by-Step Constraint application\n\nAcross the sample of ten urban areas considered in this analysis, air taxi and airport shuttle markets were\nfound to be viable (see Figure 47 for details). However, it was observed that approximately 0.5% of unconstrained trips (air taxi and airport shuttle combined) were captured after applying all constraints considered\nin the base case scenario. Infrastructure constraints (i.e., number of vertiports and their capacity) were\nfound to severely limit the potential demand for UAM. Finally, most of the available demand was captured\nby replacing mandatory trips on the ground with a trip time greater than 45 mins. No significant demand for\ndiscretional trips was found due to passenger\xe2\x80\x99s low willingness to pay67. This demand was mainly served\nby 4-seat and 5-seat eVTOLs.\n\n67 U.S. Department of Transportation provides guidance on value of travel time savings (VTTS) for passengers on mandatory (i.e., work related) and discretional (i.e., personal) trips. In general, VTTS is estimated to be half for personal travel when compared to work related travels (i.e., a passenger on a personal\ntrip would be willing to pay half as compared to work trip for same amount of travel time savings).\n\n95 | P a g e\n\n10%\n\n10%\n\n10%\n\n11%\n\n21 November 2018\n\nNEW YORK\n\nDALLAS\n\nMIAMI\n\nHOUSTON\n\nSAN FRANCISCO\n\nWASHINGTON DC\n\nPHOENIX\n\nHONOLULU\n\n1, 380, 000\n\n717, 000\n\n587, 000\n\n673, 000\n\n606, 000\n\n600, 000\n\n422, 000\n\n358, 000\n\n161, 000\n\nInfrastructure\nConstrained\n\n127, 000\n\n145, 000\n\n47, 000\n\n47, 000\n\n65, 000\n\n47, 000\n\n59, 000\n\n23, 000\n\n16, 000\n\n16, 000\n\nCapacity\nConstraint\n\n11, 000\n\n10, 500\n\n6, 700\n\n3, 400\n\n7, 000\n\n1, 800\n\n1, 100\n\n3, 200\n\n2, 000\n\n700\n\nTime of Day\nConstraint\n\n8, 800\n\n8, 400\n\n5, 360\n\n2, 720\n\n5, 600\n\n1, 440\n\n880\n\n2, 560\n\n1, 600\n\n560\n\nWeather\nConstraint\n\n8, 000\n\n7, 500\n\n4, 750\n\n2, 470\n\n4, 890\n\n1, 250\n\n780\n\n2, 230\n\n1, 460\n\n0.3%\n\n0.3%\n\n0.4%\n\n0.4%\n\n0.4%\n\n0.6%\n\n0.6%\n\n0.5%\n\n0.8%\n\n0.1%\n\n0.1%\n\n0.2%\n\n0.2%\n\n0.2%\n\n0.3%\n\n0.8%\n\n0.7%\n\n1.0%\n\n0.5%\n\n0.4%\n\n0.6%\n\n0.7%\n\n0.7%\n\nDENVER\n\n1, 421, 000\n\n550\n\nUnconstrained\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\n0.9%\n\n0.6%\n\n0.5%\n\n0.8%\n\n0.6%\n\n0.6%\n\n4%\n\n5%\n\n7%\n\n8%\n\n8%\n\n9%\n\n0.8%\n\n% OF UAM UNCONSTRAINED TRIPS\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nFigure 47: Base year Demand comparison for focus urban areas\nThe price elasticity of demand (PED) as shown in Figure 48 modeled the sensitivity of the demand to\nchanges in the price.

For each of this travel time range, percent trips captured\nby UAM service from ground transportation was calculated. It is to be noted that there was negligible\ndemand found for mandatory trips completed in less than 30 minutes by ground transportation.

More\nthan 50% of the population in most urban areas were under controlled airspace which could limit\nthe number of operations in an urban area. A first order assessment shows that more than 85% of\nthe operations in most urban areas will be flown under controlled airspace as shown in Figure 65\nabove. Existing air traffic control may not have sufficient capacity to administer the large amount of\noperations. New technologies like UTM will be needed to serve the Air Taxi market.\n10.5.2 Noise: National Park Service made long term measurements of sound in parks as well as urban\nand rural areas across the country which helped predict current sound levels for the entire United\nStates. Using this information, average noise level around each existing infrastructure was calculated. We expected noise impacts to be more severe near the take-off and landing areas. Based\non our first order analysis, we observed that in certain urban areas like New York, Denver, San\nFrancisco, etc., large percentage of operations (using existing infrastructure) will be flown in area\nof low background noise levels68. Usually, community acceptance in areas of low background noise\nis low.\n4%\n\n12%\n\n26%\n\n27%\n\n0%\n\n4%\n\n10%\n22%\n\n13%\n\n13%\n23%\n\n23%\n10%\n46%\n\n41%\n% OF OPERATIONS\n\n47%\n\n>55\n\n45%\n\n66%\n\n50-55\n60%\n\n69%\n\n70%\n\n68%\n49%\n\n49%\n\n77%\n\n40-50\n<40\n\n35%\n\n34%\n22%\n\n14%\n\n2%\n\n0%\n\n0%\n\n0%\n\n0%\n\n0%\n\n7%\n0%\n\n6%\n\n7%\n\nNEW YORK\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nDALLAS\n\nMIAMI\n\nHOUSTON\n\nSAN\nFRANCISCO\n\nWASHINGTON\nDC\n\nPHOENIX\n\nDENVER\n\nHAWAII\n\nFigure 51: Percent of operations at different background noise levels\n10.5.3 CO2 emissions: Our first order analysis found that a 5-seat piloted eVTOL (at 75% load factor)\nwas expected to generate 2 times more well-to-wake (WTW) CO2 emissions per passenger mile69\nwhen compared to an all-electric car (e.g., Tesla Model S 75D, 1.54 persons per vehicle occupancy\nrate) as shown in Figure 52.\n\n68 Low\n\nbackground noise level area does not necessarily indicate residential areas.

To calculate CO2 emissions, we used energy requirement per vehicle mile calculated earlier in supply side modeling and extrapolated Tesla GHG emissions per mile to obtain grams CO2 per vehicle mile. Load factor of 75% (including\npilot) was then applied to eVTOLs to obtain grams CO2 per passenger trip mile. Does not include energy\nrequired to perform reserve mission and dead-end trips.

Therefore, our scenarios were dependent upon the current state\nof the UAT System of System (SoS) (e.g., in the analysis reference base year), decisions and actions by\nkey stakeholders in the UAT market, future states (evolution) of the UAT System of System and emerging\ntechnologies.\nCurrent\nSystem State\n\nFuture States\n(evolution of the UAT SoS)\n\nDecisions & Actions\nby Stakeholders\n- Technology scenarios\n- Operating model\n- Pricing strategy\n\n- Technology (eVTOL) characteristics\n- Operating characteristics\n- Pricing/Premiums\n\n- General\npopulation/demand trends\n- Actions from other modes\nof transport (i.e.,\ncompetition)\n\n- Demand for UAT\n\nDemand (for UAT)\n\n- Population,\n- B2B Trip Characteristics,\n- Realized Demand\n\nATM Infrastructure\n\n- ATM Procedures\n- Airspace capacity (given\ncurrent system)\n\n- Enhancement to\ncurrent system\n- Development of UTM\n\n- Airspace capacity\n- Heliport/Vertiport capacity\n\nSystem of System Layer\n\nSupply Side (for UAT)\n\nGround Infrastructure\n\nN/A\n\n- Set of existing Heliports\nand Airports\n\n- Capacity increase of\nHeliports/Airports\n- Creation and\ndevelopment of new\n\xe2\x80\x9cVertiports\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n- Number, location and\ncapacity of Vertiports\n\nFigure 54: Framework for Scenario development.\nA.\n\nTechnology and Infrastructure Scenario\n\nTechnology Improvements: Improvements in battery technology and reduction of vehicle cost due to manufacturing learning and experience.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLi-ion battery capacity specific cost is expected to fall to $100-150/kWh price range by 2025 at a\n$10/kWh annual reduction (Source: Nykvist)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOn average, vehicle cost reduces by ~15% on doubling the production (source: NASA). We double\nthe production every five years\n\nB.\n\nHigh Network Efficiency\n\nNetwork efficiency parameters like load factor, utilization and dead-end trips were among the most significant parameters that influences the operating cost. We considered following improvements in these factors:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLoad Factor: ~80% (from ~65%) similar to commercial aviation\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nC.\n\nUtilization: ~7 hours/day (from ~4 hours/day) may be possible due to supercharging, higher system\ncapacity, demand etc.\n\nDeadend trips: ~20% (from ~37.5%)\nAutonomous eVTOL\n\nMost of the vehicles being developed are expected to have the capability to be fully autonomous. Given the\npilot shortages facing the aviation industry and the scale of UAM operations anticipated, autonomy may\nplay a key role to fully capture the realized demand. For this scenario we assumed the following:\n\n100 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nD.\n\nPilot not required, and therefore all the seats were made available to passengers\nAn extra ground staff was required to do safety briefings, loading and unloading of passengers\nInfrastructure Improvements\n\nThis scenario assumed enhancement to the current air traffic system (e.g., following the development of a\nUTM system), which allowed in-part an increase of vertiport\xe2\x80\x99s operations capacity. Increase in number of\nvertiports was coupled with increase in capacity. We doubled the number of vertiports and operational\ncapacity every five years to model new demand.\nE.\n\nNew importance of travel time\n\nContinuous advancement in Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality, large screens, new interiors in ground\nvehicles and other teleconferencing technologies may enhance the productivity of the human driver/passenger while in transit. Increased productivity may result in decrease in value of travel time, thereby affecting demand of Urban Air Taxis. We evaluated the importance of travel time/cost by introducing a significance factor in the utility function and varied it between 0 and 1. \xe2\x80\x980\xe2\x80\x99 represents no importance to travel time\nand the user was expected to choose the mode entirely based on price, comfort, etc.\nF.\n\nCompetition with other modes\n\nAutonomous cars, high speed rails, and many new or improved existing modes of transportation may pose\na potential challenge to the adoption / demand of urban air taxis. Under this scenario, we examined the\nemergence of fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) only. BCG\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. Self-Driving Cars survey 2014 showed\nstrong willingness among the American consumers to buy autonomous cars. The analysis further showed\na penetration rate of 0.5% and 10% in 2025 and 2035 for full AVs. At an average occupancy rate of ~65%\n(similar to eVTOL), we used ~$0.9 cost per passenger mile, which was ~35% less than current car ownership / operating costs in our mode choice model.\nG.\n\nTelecommuting\n\nRegular telecommuting grew 115% in the past decade (i.e., ~10% annual), nearly 10 times faster than the\nrest of the workforce. Current telecommuting population of 3.9 million (3% of total workforce) avoided 530\nmillion trips or 7.8 vehicle miles annually (source: Global Workforce Analytics). We considered a scenario\nwhere telecommuting continues to increase at a rate of ~10% every year to scope the available demand.\nH.\n\nCongestion and Latent Demand\n\neVTOLs can induce new mobility patterns including de-urbanization (i.e., people moving out of the city due\nto faster transportation options available). We explored such a scenario using parametric analysis by varying average distances for each trip by -25% to +25% at an interval of 10%. Negative percentage indicates\nincreased urbanization. Finally, mega cities can get more congested over time. However, in some scenarios\n(more pooling, better public transportation, etc.), cities can also de-congest. We explore such possibilities\nby varying average driving speed by -25% to 25% at an interval of 10%. Negative percent indicates increased congestion.\nObservation: Figure 55 shows relative demand curve (i.e., relative increase or decrease in demand due\nto change in scenario assumptions) for air taxi and airport shuttle service tested under decoupled scenarios\nA-H and a subset of coupled scenarios. We observed that autonomous cars and reduced importance of\ntravel time will severely constrain the demand for Airport Shuttle and Air Taxi markets. Telecommuting,\ndecongestion, and increased urbanization will further reduce the demand. On the other hand, high network\nefficiency, increased importance of travel time, autonomous eVTOL, technology improvements, congestion,\nde-congestion, and increased available infrastructure/capacity will all increase demand.\n\n101 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\n500%\n450%\n\n% difference with respect to base demand in a certain year\n\nInfrastructure Improvements\n\nE\n\nNew Importance of Travel Time (Timek:\nwhere k = 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)\n\nF\n\nCompetition from emerging technologies\n\nG\n\nTelecommuting\n\nH\n\n300%\n\nAutonomous eVTOL\n\nD\n\n350%\n\nHigh Network Efficiency\n\nC\n\nTime1 (E) + High Network Efficiency (B) + Technology Improvement (A) + Autonomous eVTOL\n\nTechnology Improvements\n\nB\n\n400%\n\nA\n\nLatent Demand and Congestion\n\nHigh Network Efficiency (B)\n\n250%\n\nAutonomous eVTOL (C)\n\n200%\n\n2x Number of Vertiports (D)\n2x Vertiport Capacity D)\n\n150%\nNo technical improvements (A) + Time0 (E)+ Autonomous Cars (F) + Telecommuting (G)\n\n100%\n\nAutonomous Cars (F)\nNo value of Travel Time : Time0 (E)\nDecrease in Avg.

Increased demand would risk posing greater noise concern for impacted communities.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAir Taxi market generates ~98% of its demand by capturing part of the long\ntrips (i.e. 30 mins and more) served by ground transportation.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOver 85% operations may be flown in controlled airspace (B-E) where existing\nair traffic control may not have sufficient capacity to administer the large\namount of operations. New technologies like UTM may be needed to serve the\nAir Taxi market.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLarge percentage of air taxi operations are in the areas of low background\nnoise.

The Booz Allen team selected this market as it is a complex market in terms of technical capabilities\nneeded on board the aircraft, in addition to other legal and regulatory barriers. Also, Air Ambulances were\nexpected to have higher public acceptability than airport shuttle and air taxi.\nThe Ambulance industry provides transportation of patients by ground or air, along with medical care. These\nservices are often provided during a medical emergency, but they are not restricted to such instances. The\nvehicles equipped with lifesaving equipment operated by medically trained personnel in the U.S. can be\nbroadly classified under:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGround Transportation \xe2\x80\x93 Typically used for short-distance patient transport from scene to hospital\nor inter-facility transfer.

According to Atlas 2017, there are 362 airplanes\n\nThe team investigated nine ambulance service levels as defined by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices (CMS) as shown in Table 15. CMS administers the Medicare program in the U.S. and works in\npartnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children\'s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and health insurance portability standards. Each service level had different medical equipment, crew (as shown in Table 16), vehicle requirements and were either served by ground transportation\nor air transportation depending upon the local 911 or equivalent service dispatch protocol.\nTable 15: Different Service Level as defined by CMS\n\nProvision of medically necessary supplies and services\n\nBLS Emergency\n\nProvision of BLS services, as specified above, in the\ncontext of an emergency response\n\nALS (Advanced Life Support) nonemergent\n\nProvision of medically necessary supplies and services\nincluding the provision of an ALS assessment or at least\none ALS intervention\n\nALS1 (Advanced Life Support)\nemergent\n\nProvision of ALS services in the context of an emergency\nresponse\n\nALS2 (3 separate medications by IV)\n\nProvision of ALS services in the context of an emergency\nresponse plus 3 separate medications by IV\n\nSCT (Specialty Care Transport)\n\nInterfacility transportation of a critically injured or ill\nbeneficiary including the provision of medically necessary\nsupplies and services\n\nPI (Paramedic Intercept)\nAir\nAmbulance\n\nDefinition\n\nBLS (Basic Life Support) non-emergent\n\nGround Ambulance\n\nCMS Service Level\n\nALS services provided by an entity that does not provide\nthe ambulance transport\n\nRotary Wing (Helicopters)\n\nBLS or ALS type service for short distances that require\nrapid air transport\n\nFixed Wing\n\nBLS or ALS type service for long distances that require\nrapid inter-city air transport\n\n105 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nTable 16: Crew Service Requirements\nCMS Service Level\n\nDriver1/Pilot2\n\nEmergency Medical\nTechnician (EMT)3\n\nParamedic4\n\nHealth\nProfessional5\n\nTotal\n\nBLS (Basic Life Support) non-emergent\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-\n\n-\n\n3\n\nBLS Emergency\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-\n\n-\n\n3\n\nALS (Advanced Life Support) non-emergent\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-\n\n3\n\nALS1 (Advanced Life Support) emergent\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-\n\n3\n\nALS2 (3 separate medications by IV)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-\n\n3\n\nSCT (Specialty Care Transport)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-\n\n1+\n\n3+\n\nPI (Paramedic Intercept)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-\n\n1+\n\n3+\n\nRotary Wing (Helicopters)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-\n\n3\n\nFixed Wing\n\n1+\n\n1+\n\n-\n\n1+\n\n3+\n\n1Driver:\n\nDrives the patients from place to place.

Value proposition of introducing new vehicle types was to decrease total\ntransport time of the patient. However, Dispatch, Chute, and Total Scene time were identified as fixed time\ninterval that were unaffected by vehicle capabilities for individual service levels.

Like airport shuttle and air taxi markets,\ndifferent vehicle types were considered. Based on the literature review, we assumed an average cruise\nspeed of 250 mph for hybrid vehicle types in comparison to 150 mph for eVTOLs and 100 mph for conventional Helicopters (or Rotary Wing). First order analysis shows that the total transport time for ground transportation was faster for distances less than 20-25 miles than eVTOLs as shown in Figure 58. Also, we\nobserved that an air ambulance is generally more expensive than ground ambulances. Therefore, we conclude that eVTOLs may not compete with ground ambulances at all in the first few years of entry into market.\nOn the other hand, hybrids may compete for market share with ground ambulances for distances between\n15-20 miles.\nNext, we evaluated eVTOLs and hybrids competition to fixed wing (FW) market. Due to high range requirements of FW market, both eVTOLs and Hybrids were found to be not suitable to serve fixed wing market in\nthe near term. It is to be noted from Figure 58 that hybrids could potentially serve Specialty Care Transport\n(SCT) service level. However, SCT is <1% of ambulance market and requires much larger vehicle size\n(higher number of crew).

We assumed that each of these sub-missions are flown at\nsimilar speeds and follow similar profiles (i.e., Taxi, Hover Climb, Climb, Cruise, Descend, Hover Descend,\nand Taxi). For the fourth mission (Scene) we assumed an air ambulance in Taxi mode. Total Flight time\nwas the sum of response, transport, and return time. After completing the patient transport to the hospital,\nthe air ambulance returned to its base (N-R) and was prepared for return to service (R-Q). For RWs, return\nto service time (referred to as preparation time) included the time to re-fuel the aircraft, which was assumed\nto be 5-15 mins while for eVTOL R_Q refers to the time required to recharge batteries for the next mission.\nEach flight sub-mission followed the same mission profile as Air Taxi and Airport Shuttle mission types.

At an\naverage battery charger maximum power setting of 125 kW, we found that eVTOL\xe2\x80\x99s preparation time (i.e.,\ntime required to bring the vehicle back in service) was significantly higher due to high battery charging\ntimes. Therefore, we consider two scenarios in an effort to reduce total call time:\n\n11.5.1 Scenario 1: Revised ConOps \xe2\x80\x93 In the original ConOps, under Transport phase (M), patient\nwas transported from the scene to the medical facilities. For this scenario, we explored battery\nrecharging during patient disembarkation time (~ 5 mins) to reduce overall range requirement,\nwhich can reduce battery requirement. We found that this scenario reduced the total range required\nto 30-180 miles (vs 50-200 miles). Hence, average battery weight in case of eVTOLs was reduced\nto ~3,200 lbs.

Battery swapping was assumed to take around 5 minutes.

However, return time increased\nsignificantly for eVTOL (and eVTOL with revised ConOps scenario) due to high battery recharging times,\nwhich almost doubled the total call time and approximately halved the availability of the vehicle for next\nmission when compared to RW. Moreover, reduction in availability of an eVTOL reduced utilization, which\n\n113 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nincreased the cost per transport making eVTOL an unfavorable option to replace RWs.

In the previous sections, we established that eVTOLs (without battery\nswapping capabilities) will be required to perform a greater number of transports to maintain the same cost\nlevel as RW. Therefore, an increased number of required transports will increase the probability of vehicle\nbeing unavailable to serve an emergency event, thereby reducing dispatch reliability. We found eVTOLs\ndispatch reliability to be around 90%, which is well below the industry standard of 99% as shown in Figure\n71.\nHowever, on distributing the demand on an hourly basis (step 2), we found that eVTOLs can serve the 10%\nof the total demand between 12 am \xe2\x80\x93 6 am maintaining the same dispatch reliability as RW.

What stood out as barriers at the beginning of the study have eased into opportunities as many of\nthese developments unfolded near the end of this project. With that in mind, we recommend that any future\nstudies emphasize the need to be agile in a quickly changing legal environment, and that the focus on\n\xe2\x80\x9cbarriers\xe2\x80\x9d be shifted to \xe2\x80\x9copportunities\xe2\x80\x9d so that NASA can find ways to design, develop, and test advanced\nUAM technologies that will translate into enabling legislation.\nThe societal barrier analysis demonstrated the need to conduct further research by employing a flight\nsimulator and/or an actual certified aircraft as part of a pilot program or test clinic. Simulations or flight\nexperience in a UAM aircraft might give respondents a more realistic understanding of UAM travel. Another\noption would be to further study the influence of congestion on UAM perceptions. In our survey, we did not\ncollect data on a respondent\xe2\x80\x99s commute time or attitude toward congestion. Interestingly, commute distance\nwas slightly significant in regression model. To better understand this, we examined the city of residence\nas a possible predictor related to commute time, as each of the cities has a different mean commute time.\nAccording to the 2016 ACS, mean travel time to work is 29.5 minutes in Houston, 29.6 minutes in Los\nAngeles, 35.9 in New York City, 32.1 minutes in the San Francisco Bay Area, and 34.4 minutes in\nWashington, D.C. The binomial logistic regression model had statistically significant coefficients for Los\nAngeles and the San Francisco Bay Area in contrast to Houston. However, respondents from Houston and\nLos Angeles have shorter mean commute times and yet are more willing to use UAM. This indicates the\nmean commute time for the city is not a good stand-in for a respondent\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to use UAM or perhaps\nour respondent population was not representative of each of the cities with respect to commute time.\nFurther study of the role of congestion as a predictor of UAM interest may be fruitful to explore in a future\nproject.\nFrom the weather analysis, we found that synthesis of potential weather impacts across a broad range of\noperations and vehicles is a challenge. For example, IFR conditions could be highly impactful if assuming\npiloted VFR-only operations, but minimal for fully-automated vehicles equipped with sensors to enable IFR\nflight. The impact scores would likely vary depending on operation specifics. For a future study, we\nrecommend exploring some specific case examples to apply detailed assumptions on vehicle and\noperations to more fully explore the range in weather impacts. This would also enable weather barriers to\nbe more fully captured into the market analysis supply and demand models.\nFinally, market analysis demonstrated the uncertainties that exist in the various assumptions made\nthroughout the analysis in relation to availability and specifications of technology, Air Traffic Control\ncapabilities, ground infrastructure development, public acceptance, laws and regulations. For example,\nassumptions related to technology and operations were made through literature review and interviews with\nSAG members. As such, the assumptions seemed realistic, a high priority area of future work should be to\nupdate them with the development of technology and as operations are planned. Our analysis also\ndemonstrated the implications of different technology, operations and market related scenarios. For\nexample, Autonomous cars and reduced importance of travel time were found to severely constrain the\ndemand for Air Taxis, while autonomy, high network efficiency and increased congestion were found to\nincrease demand. For a future study, we recommend detail exploration of technology infusion trends (both\nspatial and temporal) in the entire transportation sector that could affect UAM markets. We also recommend\nto study environment sustainability (noise, emissions, ecological and visual pollution) of UAM at a system\nlevel. In our study, we identified 36 potential UAM markets and focused our analysis on ten urban areas.\nOur extrapolation of results to all of U.S. may not have captured the nuances of other urban areas.\nTherefore, we recommend including more urban areas for detailed analysis, and also study market\nfeasibility of the remaining markets to understand the true scale of operations. Supply chain of\nmanufacturers should be analyzed taking into account global demand, and aircraft price (based on\neconomies of scale), fleet mix and evolution should also be studied.\n\n118 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nAppendix\n\nAppendix 1: Societal Barriers\nAppendix 2: Weather Analysis\nAppendix 3: Market Analysis\n\n119 | P a g e\n\n21 November 2018\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\n13.0 APPENDIX\nThe appendix provides more details to following sections of the analysis: Societal Barriers,\nWeather Analysis, and Market Analysis\n\nAppendix 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Societal Barriers (General Population Survey)\n13.1.1 Travel Behavior\nMany of the trips were recreational, with 39% urban recreational trips (i.e., a trip within the city) and 29%\nlong distance recreational trips (i.e., a trip between cities). Respondents living in the New York Metropolitan\narea were more likely to travel within the city (45%), while respondents living in Houston had slightly higher\nthan average trips to healthcare services and long-distance recreational trips, compared to the other cities.\nThe trip purpose by city is displayed in Figure 73 below.\nWhat was the purpose of your most recent trip (either local or long distance) other than\nto/from work or school?\n50%\n40%\n\n41%\n\n39%\n32%\n\n32%\n\n29%\n\n29%\n\n30%\n18%\n\n20%\n\n13%\n\n11%\n\n10%\n\n15%\n\n12%\n\n10%\n\n0%\nHouston, N = 342\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area, N = 340\n\nLos Angeles, N = 343\n\nUrban recreational trip (e.g., a trip within a city)\n\nLong distance recreational trip (e.g., a trip between cities)\n\nGo to/from healthcare services\n\nGo to/from the airport\n\nWhat was the purpose of your most recent trip (either local or long distance) other than\nto/from work or school?\n50%\n\n40%\n\n45%\n39%\n\n38%\n27%\n\n30%\n\n16%\n\n20%\n\n11%\n\n10%\n\n29%\n\n26%\n\n15%\n\n15%\n8%\n\n10%\n\n0%\nWashington, D.C., N = 343\n\nNew York City, N = 345\n\nTotal, N = 1714\n\nUrban recreational trip (e.g., a trip within a city)\n\nLong distance recreational trip (e.g., a trip between cities)\n\nGo to/from healthcare services\n\nGo to/from the airport\n\nFigure 73: Recent Trip Purpose\nNext, we linked the trip purpose with the distance traveled to produce the distributions in Figure 74 below.\nUrban recreational trips and healthcare-related trips were generally skewed toward distances less than 10\nmiles, while the majority of long-distance recreational trips (54% of 489 trips) were over 100 miles. One\npotential limitation of the trip distance findings for healthcare services was the variance in trip type; UAM\nmay not be suitable for all trip types. Routine medical appointments, urgent care, or emergency trips in air\nambulances were captured as healthcare-related trips. Finally, of the 176 respondents who traveled to the\nairport for their most recent trip, 30% were over 100 miles away, indicating that a significant portion of the\nrespondent population traveled quite far for air travel. There could be a number of reasons for this behavior,\nparticularly in markets where there are multiple large domestic and international airports. For example,\n\n120 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nsomeone living in Northern Virginia may travel to Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s BWI for a cheaper fare or use a particular\ncarrier rather than using their closest airport (i.e., Dulles or Regan National).\nAbout how far (distance, in miles) did you travel on this most recent trip?\n60%\n\n54%\n\n50%\n\n0.6 - 1 miles\n\n1.1 - 3 miles\n\n40%\n\n3.1 - 5 miles\n5.1 - 10 miles\n\n30%\n19% 18%\n\n20%\n10%\n\n0 - 0.5 miles\n\n2%\n\n10.1 - 15 miles\n17%\n\n15.1 - 25 miles\n11% 9%\n7%\n\n6%\n\n4%\n\n0%\n\n6%\n1%\n\nUrban recreational trip (e.g., a trip within a city),\nN = 663\n\n3% 4%\n1% 2%\n\n7%\n\n25.1 - 50 miles\n\n7% 6%\n5%\n4% 6%\n\n50.1 - 75 miles\n\n75.1-100 miles\n\nLong distance recreational trip (e.g., a trip between cities),\nN = 489\n\nOver 100 miles\n\nAbout how far (distance, in miles) did you travel on this most recent trip?\n60%\n\n0 - 0.5 miles\n\n50%\n\n0.6 - 1 miles\n\n1.1 - 3 miles\n\n40%\n\n3.1 - 5 miles\n\n30%\n\n30%\n21% 22%\n\n20%\n10%\n\n5%\n\n8%\n\n0%\n\n5.1 - 10 miles\n\n10.1 - 15 miles\n17%\n\n14%\n9% 9%\n\n5%\n\n2% 1% 3%\n\nGo to/from healthcare services,\nN = 265\n\n3% 5% 4%\n\n9%\n\n10%\n\n15.1 - 25 miles\n\n14%\n\n25.1 - 50 miles\n\n7%\n2% 3%\n\nGo to/from the airport,\nN = 176\n\n50.1 - 75 miles\n\n75.1-100 miles\nOver 100 miles\n\nFigure 74: Most Recent Trip Distance\nFigure 75 below displays the travel modes used to the most recent trip destination. The highest modal share\nfor the most recent trip was driving, with approximately 60% of respondents using a car for the trip, followed\nby public transit at 31%. Sixteen percent of the trips were traveled by airplane. Houston was heavily skewed\ntoward drivers (73%) with low public transit use (11%). Not surprisingly, New York City respondents were\nmuch less likely to drive (33%) and were skewed toward using public transit (54%).\nRespondents were presented a series of questions that we designed to capture their typical commute behavior; these questions were based on the questions asked regarding the most recent non-commute trip.\nRespondents were asked to select the transportation modes they use to commute to work or school, how\nmany days per week they commute, and the distance (one-way) of their commute. The typical commute\ndistance was generally between 1 and 10 miles in all five cities. Driving (62%), public transit (56%), telecommuting (54%), and walking (26%) were all popular modes for commuting. The percentages add up to\nmore than 100%, as respondents could use more than one mode during their commute. For example, a\nrespondent could have a multi-modal commute where they rode their bicycle to a light rail station and then\ntook light rail to work. This would result in the selection of two modes. Respondents were also given the\nability to select: \xe2\x80\x9ctelecommute.\xe2\x80\x9d Some of the respondents telecommute several days a week and then travel\nto a workplace for other days throughout the week, leading to overlap between physical modes and telecommuting in Figure 76. We also asked respondents to identify the factors that impact how they choose to\ntravel to a destination. Cost and convenience were the most important motivators impacting modal choice.\n\n121 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nOn this most recent trip, how did you travel to your final destination?

Regarding factors that encourage or discourage respondents from flying more frequently, the respondent was presented a list of factors related to the decision\nto fly, such as: flexibility, total flight time, cost, and the ability to visit places out of town. The respondent\nwas presented a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \xe2\x80\x9cvery much encourage\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cvery much discourage\xe2\x80\x9d and\nwas asked to rate each of the factors.

The results of this question are enumerated in Figure 79 below.\nNext, the respondent was asked to similarly rate factors related to their flying experience, such as the checkin experience, security process, and on-board experience. The results of this second question can be\nviewed in Figure 80 below.

As such, we aimed to evaluate the extent to which respondents\nwould use UAM in an altered transportation landscape. Respondents were introduced to the concepts of\nautomated vehicles (AVs) and shared automated vehicles (SAVs) through short descriptions, as follows:\n\xe2\x80\x9cAVs are vehicles that move passengers with some level of automation that assists or replaces human\ncontrol. Shared AVs are automated vehicles that are shared among multiple users and can be summoned\non-demand similar to ridesourcing (Uber/Lyft) or can operate a fixed-route service like a bus.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNext, we asked respondents whether they would prefer to use an AV or SAV over a UAM aircraft for the\ntrip purposes they had already selected for use. Generally, respondents preferred UAM aircraft for longdistance trips and going to/from the airport, while they preferred AVs for commuting and urban recreational\n\n132 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\ntrips. Across the cities, preferences for UAM vs. AVs varied, as seen in Figure 86 below. Respondents in\nLos Angeles appeared to be more open to future technologies, as there were far fewer neutral responses.\nRespondents in New York City expressed a slight preference for using UAM for healthcare trips, perhaps\ndue to the location of health services within the cityscape or traffic concerns. The other cities were either\nevenly split or preferred AV for healthcare trips.\n[Houston] For the trip purposes you selected for Urban Air Mobility travel, please indicate whether you\nwould prefer to travel with an automated vehicle (AV) or an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft.\n60%\n40%\n\n50%\n\n45%\n32%\n18%\n\n20%\n\n25%\n\n42% 44%\n20%\n\n42%\n30%\n\n26%\n\n8%\n\n40% 36%\n\n19%\n\nPrefer to use AV\n\nNeutral\n\n0%\n\nCommute to/from\nwork or school,\nN = 95\n\nUrban recreational trip\nLong-distance\nGo to/from healthcare Go to/from the airport,\n(e.g., a trip within a recreational trip (e.g., a\nservices,\nN = 126\ncity),\ntrip between cities),\nN = 66\nN = 135\nN = 185\n\nPrefer to use UAM Aircraft\n\n[San Francisco Bay Area]\n60%\n\n40%\n\n49%\n\n25%\n\n23%\n\n20%\n\n35%\n\n48%\n\n46%\n16%\n\n38%\n\n38%\n\n49%\n\n46%\n\n14%\n\n13%\n\n27%\n\n22%\n\nPrefer to use AV\nNeutral\n\n0%\nCommute to/from\nwork or school,\nN = 73\n\nUrban recreational trip\nLong-distance\nGo to/from healthcare Go to/from the airport,\n(e.g., a trip within a recreational trip (e.g., a\nservices,\nN = 130\ncity),\ntrip between cities),\nN = 56\nN = 107\nN = 189\n\nPrefer to use UAM Aircraft\n\n[Los Angeles]\n60%\n40%\n\n47%\n\n38% 38%\n\n29%\n\n17%\n\n20%\n\n45% 41%\n\n31%\n\n17%\n\n36%\n\n40% 39%\n\n29%\n14%\n\n11%\n\nPrefer to use AV\nNeutral\n\n0%\nCommute to/from\nwork or school,\nN = 100\n\nUrban recreational trip\nLong-distance\nGo to/from healthcare Go to/from the airport,\n(e.g., a trip within a recreational trip (e.g., a\nservices,\nN = 112\ncity),\ntrip between cities),\nN = 59\nN = 154\nN = 180\n\nPrefer to use UAM Aircraft\n\n[Washington, D.C.]\n60%\n40%\n\n53%\n\n46%\n33%\n\n37%\n\n31%\n18%\n\n20%\n\n55%\n\n50%\n17%\n\n43%\n\n29%\n12%\n\n11%\n\n34%\n\n20%\n\nPrefer to use AV\nNeutral\n\n0%\nCommute to/from\nwork or school,\nN = 84\n\nUrban recreational trip\nLong-distance\nGo to/from healthcare Go to/from the airport,\n(e.g., a trip within a recreational trip (e.g., a\nservices,\nN = 120\ncity),\ntrip between cities),\nN = 51\nN = 121\nN = 206\n\nPrefer to use UAM Aircraft\n\n[New York City]\n60%\n40%\n\n51%\n24%\n\n20%\n\n44%\n\n22%\n\n29%\n\n53%\n\n44% 42%\n23%\n\n12%\n\n40%\n18%\n\n24%\n\n24%\n\n32%\nPrefer to use AV\nNeutral\n\n0%\nCommute to/from\nwork or school,\nN = 86\n\nUrban recreational trip\nLong-distance\nGo to/from healthcare Go to/from the airport,\n(e.g., a trip within a recreational trip (e.g., a\nservices,\nN = 177\ncity),\ntrip between cities),\nN = 45\nN = 113\nN = 202\n\nFigure 86: AV vs. UAM Travel\n\n133 | P a g e\n\nPrefer to use UAM Aircraft\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nRegarding SAVs, respondents were slightly less likely to prefer SAVs over UAM aircraft than they were to\nprefer AVs over UAM aircraft (see Figure 87 below). Respondents generally preferred UAM for long-distance travel and trips to/from the airport, while preferring SAVs for commuting and urban recreational trips.\nHowever, the respondents from the San Francisco Bay Area tended to be less favorable to SAVs than\nrespondents from the other four cities. In San Francisco, UAM was preferred over SAVs for commuting and\nthere was very little preference between the two modes for urban recreational trips.\n[Houston] For the trip purposes you selected for Urban Air Mobility travel, please indicate whether you\nwould prefer to travel with a shared automated vehicle (SAV) or an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft.\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n\n45%\n\n42%\n28%\n\n24%\n\nCommute to/from\nwork or school,\nN = 95\n\n19%\n\n47%\n\n41% 43%\n\n29%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n47%\n32%\n\n34%\nPrefer to use SAV\n\n13%\n\nNeutral\n\nUrban recreational trip\nLong-distance\nGo to/from healthcare Go to/from the airport,\n(e.g., a trip within a recreational trip (e.g., a\nservices,\nN = 126\ncity),\ntrip between cities),\nN = 66\nN = 135\nN = 185\n\nPrefer to use UAM Aircraft\n\n[San Francisco Bay Area]\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n\n58%\n\n57%\n26%\n\n15%\n\nCommute to/from\nwork or school,\nN = 73\n\n20%\n\n52%\n18%\n\n50%\n\n39%\n23%\n\n50%\n18%\n\n7%\n\n27%\n\n20%\n\nPrefer to use SAV\nNeutral\n\nUrban recreational trip\nLong-distance\nGo to/from healthcare Go to/from the airport,\n(e.g., a trip within a recreational trip (e.g., a\nservices,\nN = 130\ncity),\ntrip between cities),\nN = 56\nN = 107\nN = 189\n\nPrefer to use UAM Aircraft\n\n[Los Angeles]\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n\n32%\n\n51%\n\n44%\n\n18%\n\n43% 41%\n25%\n\n20%\n\n39%\n22%\n\n13%\n\n43%\n29%\n\n36%\nPrefer to use SAV\n\n15%\n\nNeutral\nCommute to/from\nwork or school,\nN = 100\n\nUrban recreational trip\nLong-distance\nGo to/from healthcare Go to/from the airport,\n(e.g., a trip within a recreational trip (e.g., a\nservices,\nN = 112\ncity),\ntrip between cities),\nN = 59\nN = 154\nN = 180\n\nPrefer to use UAM Aircraft\n\n[Washington, D.C.]\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n\n53%\n\n46%\n29%\n\n24%\n\n26%\n\n53%\n\n46% 41%\n21%\n\n24%\n\n11%\n\n43% 40%\n22%\n\nPrefer to use SAV\n\n13%\n\nNeutral\nCommute to/from\nwork or school,\nN = 84\n\nUrban recreational trip\nLong-distance\nGo to/from healthcare Go to/from the airport,\n(e.g., a trip within a recreational trip (e.g., a\nservices,\nN = 120\ncity),\ntrip between cities),\nN = 51\nN = 121\nN = 206\n\nPrefer to use UAM Aircraft\n\n[New York City]\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n\n53%\n22%\n\n49%\n21%\n\n19%\n\n38%\n\n27%\n12%\n\n47%\n\n47%\n\n42% 37%\n\n31%\n16%\n\n17%\n\nPrefer to use SAV\nNeutral\n\nCommute to/from\nwork or school,\nN = 86\n\nUrban recreational trip\nLong-distance\nGo to/from healthcare Go to/from the airport,\n(e.g., a trip within a recreational trip (e.g., a\nservices,\nN = 177\ncity),\ntrip between cities),\nN = 45\nN = 113\nN = 202\n\nFigure 87: SAV vs. UAM Travel\n\n134 | P a g e\n\nPrefer to use UAM Aircraft\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nNext, we asked several questions related to vertiports (specified landing/takeoff locations for UAM aircraft).\nFuture UAM users will most likely need to travel to vertiports to use the service, and users will most likely\ntake multimodal trips which require travel to access a UAM aircraft. We asked survey respondents whether\nthey would be willing to travel to a vertiport, how much they would be willing to pay to travel to a vertiport,\nand how much time they would be willing to spend traveling to the vertiport. An additional question probed\nthe preferred transportation mode that each respondent would use to access the vertiport. The results of\nthese questions are presented in Figure 88 to 89, as well as Table 23.\nApproximately half of the respondents were willing to travel to the vertiport; an additional 31% of respondents indicated that they might be willing to travel to the vertiport. Women were more hesitant to travel to a\nvertiport \xe2\x80\x93 a slightly higher proportion of women were unwilling to travel to a vertiport and more women also\nindicated that they might travel to a vertiport (Figure 88). Of the respondents who were willing to use a\nvertiport, most were unwilling to take more than 20 to 30 minutes to travel to it (Figure 89). Likewise, most\nwere not willing to pay more than $10 to access a vertiport (Figure 90).\n\nWould you be willing to travel to a vertiport (i.e., a specified landing/takeoff\nlocation) to take an Urban Air Mobility aircraft?\n60%\n\n56%\n\n50%\n\n45%\n\n40%\n\n35%\n\nYes\n\n27%\n\n30%\n20%\n\n20%\n\nNo\n\n17%\n\nMaybe\n\n10%\n0%\nFemale, N = 975\n\nMale, N = 738\n\nFigure 88: Willingness to Use Vertiport\n\nWhat is the maximum time you would travel to access a vertiport?\n25%\n20%\n\n20%\n\n22%\n\n23%\n\n14%\n\n15%\n10%\n\n7%\n\n5%\n\n3%\n\n2%\n\n4%\n2%\n\n2%\n\n0%\n0-5\n6 - 10\n11 - 15 15 - 20 21 - 30 31 - 40 41 - 50 51 - 60 Between\nminutes minutes minutes minutes minutes minutes minutes minutes 1 and 2\nhours\nTotal, N = 1196\n\nFigure 89: Time to Access Vertiport\n\n135 | P a g e\n\nOver 2\nhours\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nWhat is the most you would be willing to pay for a one-way trip to get to or from the vertiport?\n25%\n\n22%\n\n20%\n15%\n\n10%\n\n22% 22%\n19%\n\n18%\n\n18%\n\n15%\n8%\n\n7% 8%\n\n4%\n\n5%\n\n17%\n\n14%\n\n13%\n\n12%\n\n11% 11% 10%\n\n10%\n\n20%\n\n9%\n\n7%\n\n4%\n\n3%\n\n0%\n\nHouston, N = 273\n25%\n19%\n\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n\n21%\n\n11%\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area, N = 274\n18% 19% 18%\n\n18%\n10% 11%\n\n6%\n\n5%\n\n19%\n16%\n\n15%\n10% 9%\n\n7%\n\nLos Angeles, N = 281\n20%\n15%\n10% 9%\n\n8%\n\n4%\n\n3%\n\n0%\nWashington, D.C., N = 286\n\nNew York City, N = 268\n\nTotal, N = 1383\n\n$0 - $0.99 one-way\n\n$1 - $2.99 one-way\n\n$3 - $4.99 one-way\n\n$5 - $9.99 one-way\n\n$10 - $14.99 one-way\n\n$15 - $19.99 one-way\n\n$20 - $40 one-way\n\nMore than $40 one-way\n\nFigure 90: Cost to Access Vertiport\nMost respondents would prefer to drive, take public transit, or use ridesourcing (e.g., Lyft, Uber) to access\nthe vertiport (see Table 23 ). San Francisco and New York City each had 10% of respondents that preferred\nto walk or run to access a vertiport, while Los Angeles had around 7% of respondents preferring carsharing\n(e.g., Zipcar, car2go).\nTable 23: Preferred Modes for Vertiport Access\n\nDriving\nPublic Transit\nRidesourcing\nTaxi\nBicycle\nBike Sharing\nCar Sharing\nAutomated Vehicle\nShared Automated Vehicle\nWalk/Run\nOther\n\nTotal,\nN = 1380\n39%\n25%\n16%\n3%\n1%\n0%\n1%\n4%\n1%\n7%\n3%\n\nHouston,\nN = 273\n58%\n12%\n16%\n1%\n0%\n0%\n1%\n5%\n1%\n3%\n2%\n\nSan Francisco\nBay Area,\nN = 274\n32%\n28%\n18%\n4%\n1%\n0%\n0%\n3%\n1%\n10%\n3%\n\nLos Angeles,\nN = 278\n46%\n17%\n20%\n1%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n7%\n1%\n5%\n4%\n\nWashington,\nD.C.,\nN = 287\n42%\n28%\n11%\n2%\n0%\n1%\n1%\n5%\n0%\n6%\n5%\n\nNew York City,\nN = 267\n15%\n42%\n15%\n9%\n1%\n0%\n1%\n3%\n1%\n10%\n3%\n\nMany of the respondents (52% across the sample population) were not interested in owning a personal\nUAM aircraft; however, 17% of respondents were interested in ownership. Men were more interested in\nowning a UAM aircraft than women (21% for men vs. 13% for women). We also explored whether the\nsupply of UAM aircraft and pilots could be augmented through peer-to-peer (P2P) operations. For example,\nwould owners of UAM aircraft be willing to rent out their aircraft or transport other people (similar to services,\nsuch as Lyft and Uber)? For those who answered \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x9d to the question of interest\nin owning a personal UAM aircraft, there is high willingness to use the aircraft as part of a larger fleet service\n(e.g., Lyft, Uber). Approximately 44% of the sample respondents were willing to rent out their personal UAM\naircraft for use by others. Los Angeles had a particularly high willingness to participate in shared mobility\nservices \xe2\x80\x93 around 55% of those willing to own an aircraft were willing to also rent it out to others (i.e., a P2P\n\n136 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nservice model). This suggests that perhaps there may be room for P2P operations with UAM aircraft. However, respondents were not as interested in fractional ownership (i.e., shared ownership of a UAM among\nindividuals). Only 20% of the sample respondents were willing to share ownership of a UAM aircraft.\nIn order for P2P markets to be viable, licensed pilots and people willing to fly UAM aircraft are necessary.\nThe respondents were asked if they would be willing to fly a UAM aircraft, and approximately one in five\nrespondents were willing. Los Angeles had an even higher percentage of respondents who were willing to\nfly a UAM aircraft at 30%. However, the survey population was heavily skewed toward those with pilot\xe2\x80\x99s\nlicenses. Approximately one in five of the survey respondents claimed to possess a pilot\xe2\x80\x99s license, which is\nmuch higher than the national average. As of 2017, only 0.2% of U.S. residents were active certified pilots\n(FAA, 2018).\n.\n\n137 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n13.2\n\n21 November 2018\n\nAppendix 2

In the first few years of operation, there is an on-board pilot to operate the aircraft. Pilot occupies one seat, therefore, each eVTOL has\none less seat available for passengers. Hence, 1-seat aircraft are assumed to be unavailable. For a certain\nseat category, cost per passenger mile (or vehicle mile) is calculated for each aircraft type separately. A\nmedian value is then calculated from the cost numbers of all six aircraft type that represents cost per passenger mile (or vehicle mile) for that seat category.\nCost Model\nCapital Cost\nInsurance\nEnergy Costs\n\nMultirotor\n\nBattery Reserve\n\nLift and Cruise\n\nCrew Cost and\nTraining\n\nSeat Configuration\n\nAircraft Type\n\nTilt Duct\n\nMaintenance Cost\nLanding Fees/\nInfrastructure\nRoute Cost\n\n1 Seat Category\nMedian Cost per mile\nfor each seat\nconfiguration and cost\nmodel (Cm)\n\n3 Seat Category\n\nTilt Rotor\nTilt Wing\n\n4 Seat Category\nCompound\nHelicopter\n\n!"#$%\t\'()*$+\t,"-#\t.(/\t0*%(\t\n\nMedian Cost per\npassenger mile for each\nseat configuration and\ncost model (Cpm)\n\n2 Seat Category\n\n!"#$%\t\'()*$+\t,"-#\t.(/\t.$--(+3(/\t0*%(\t\n\n= \t 2,0\n\n= \t 2,.0\n\n5 Seat Category\n\nIndirect Operating\nCost\n\nKey Steps\n\nMonte Carlo\nAnalysis\n\nTaxes\n\nOutput\n\nFigure 106: Structure of Cost Modeling\n\n13.3.2 Capital and Insurance Cost Model\nThere are 100+ aircraft designs proposed around the world to serve urban Air Taxi and Airport Shuttle\nmarket.

Calculation of insurance cost of an aircraft is subjective in nature as it depends\non 6-12 months of recent aviation history. Therefore, this analysis relies on historical insurance cost of\nhelicopters as a percent of vehicle price. Aircraft insurance is a sum of liability and hull insurance for the\nbase year. Age adjustment will be added for future year projections. Liability insurance covers both public\nand private liabilities while hull insurance covers both in-motion and not-in-motion cases. Insurance cost\ndoes not include infrastructure/facilities insurance (bundled under indirect operating cost).\n\n147 | P a g e\n\nNASA UAM Market Study \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n21 November 2018\n\nRobinson R44_1\nRobinson R44_2\n\n2.47%\n\nRobinson R66\n\n2.30%\n\nBell 427\n\n3.28%\n\nBell 206L3\n\n2.36%\n\nAgusta Westland 109 Grand New\n\n2.39%\n\nAgusta Westland 119 Koala\n\n2.78%\n\nAirbus H120/Eurocopter EC 120B\n\n3.93%\n\nMIN\n\n$ 0.32\n\n$ 0.32\n\n$ 0.26\n\n$ 0.30\n\n$ 0.22\n\n$ 0.39\n\n5 Seat Aircraft\n\n2.67%\n\nMedian Insurance Cost per\nvehicle mile\n\n4 Seat Aircraft\n\n2.60%\n\nMedian Insurance Cost per\npassenger mile\n\n2 Seat Aircraft\n\nInsurance as a %\nof aircraft price\n\nRobinson R22\n\nAircraft Type\n\n3 Seat Aircraft\n\nHelicopter\n\n$ 0.21\n\n$ 0.47\n\nLiability Insurance\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Passenger: Protects passengers riding in the accident aircraft who are injured or killed\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Public Related: Protects aircraft owners for damage that their aircraft does to third\nparty property, such as houses, cars, crops, airport facilities and other aircraft struck in\na collision\nHull Insurance\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Not-in-motion: Provides coverage for the insured aircraft against damage when it is\non the ground and not in motion\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In-motion: Protects an insured aircraft against damage during all phases of flight and\nground operation\n\nMAX\n\nSource: Aircraft Cost Calculator (2015),\nRobinson Helicopter Company (2018)\n\nFigure 110: Insurance Cost per Passenger Mile\n\n13.3.3 Energy Cost Model\nPhases of Flight1\n\neVTOL speed\nin different\nphases\n\nMission Distance\n\nAverage mission\ndistance\n\nTaxi\nTotal Power\nrequired\n\nTake-off\nTime Spent in each\nphases of flight\n\nClimb\n\nAverage Power\nrequired for\ndifferent mission\ndistance\n\nEnergy Cost for\naverage power\n\nCruise\n\nMonte Carlo\nAnalysis\n\nLanding\n\nPower Curve for Hover\nbased on MTOW with\nrespect to reference\naircraft (e.g., Boeing\neVTOL)\n\nYoY Energy Cost\nper mile\n\nPower required for\neach phase of flight\n\nDescent\n\n% power\nrequired vs\nHover for\nCruise and\nLanding\n\nPower required\nto climb i.e.,\nPower vs\nAltitude\n\nApply Electricity Prices\nfor different energy\nprices and different\npeak powers at each\nvertiport\n\nOutput\n\nof Flight\nTaxi: Preparation time to lift off once the passengers are on-board\n\n2.\n\nTake-off: Climb vertically at hover power (no horizontal movement)\nClimb: Climb to cruise height\n\n4.\n\nKey Steps\n\n1.\n3.\n\nInfluenced by Demand\nInput\n\n1Phases\n\nCruise: Flight phase that occurs when the aircraft levels after a climb to a cruise altitude\nand before it begins to descend\n\n5.\n\nDescent: Aircraft begins approach to final landing.
