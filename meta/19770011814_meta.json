Segments of the ascent test (OFT) configuration were modeled utilizing the information management system interpretive model (IMSIM) in a computerized simulation modeling of the OFT hardware and software workload. System requirements for simulation of the OFT configuration were defined, and sensitivity analyses determined areas of potential data flow problems in DDPS operation. Based on the defined system requirements and these sensitivity analyses, a test design was developed for adapting, parameterizing, and executing IMSIM, using varying load and stress conditions for model execution. Analyses of the computer simulation runs are documented, including results, conclusions, and recommendations for DDPS improvements.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770011814, "id": "9f0b707e6eec4ba2aba1915f9ad70571", "publicationDate": "1977-02-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770011814.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770011814/downloads/19770011814.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770011814/downloads/19770011814.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770011814/downloads/19770011814.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
